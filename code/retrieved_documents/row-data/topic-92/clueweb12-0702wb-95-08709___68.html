<h3>Decorate with Lamps</h3> 
<p>My apartment is not very well lit. And even though my living quarters are 
small, I need adequate lighting for reading, dining, paying bills, and more. 
That&rsquo;s why I rely on lamps for nighttime illumination. Lamps provide 
portable, much-needed light&mdash;and look good doing it.</p> 
<p>Because lamps come in an abundance of shapes, sizes, and materials, lamp 
shopping can be a challenge. How do you know you&rsquo;re getting one that 
suits your needs and makes a decorative statement?</p> 
<p>First, ask yourself what the lamp will be used for. Reading? Highlighting a 
specific object in your living room? Once you narrow down a purpose, pick a 
lamp that fits the scale of the space you&rsquo;re working with. For example, 
if you opt for a table lamp, you don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm the tabletop, 
yet you don&rsquo;t want a lamp that looks incredibly small either. (Also 
consider how hefty your lamp is&mdash;if you have small children, heavier lamps 
are best because they&rsquo;re more resistant to tipping.)</p> 
<p>Remember: The edges of the shade shouldn&rsquo;t extend past the edges of 
the table. And just as a shade shouldn&rsquo;t take over a table, it 
shouldn&rsquo;t take over the lamp either.</p> 
<p>Want more insight on picking the perfect lamp? Start with these sites: The 
Decorating Diva, HGTV, and Lowe&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to pick a lamp that complements, rather than 
competes with, your d&eacute;cor. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t 
have fun&mdash;look for playful shapes, colorful shades, and more. For example, 
if you want your lamp to make an architectural statement, check out thisTeal 
Drum Lamp from Pier 1 Imports. The organic shape of the cast-iron base 
functions as a work of art&mdash;and I love the way the teal silk shade 
contrasts against it. ThisQuad Floor Lamp from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond puts a 
unique twist on standard floor lamps. Or if you want a burst of color and a 
simple profile (and are feeling crafty), you can even transform colorful glass 
bottles into lamps too&mdash;<em>Hallmark</em> magazine shows you how.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re short on space, look for a lamp that multitasks as a shelf, 
such as thisEtag&egrave;re Wood Lamp from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Another way to 
save space is to hang lights from the ceiling. Try these coolpendant lamps from 
Target (I&rsquo;m particularly fond of their funky striped shades). And slender 
floor lamps also brighten a room without sacrificing much space.</p> 
<p>For custom flair, why not embellish a plain lampshade? Whether you choose 
to paint it, wrap it in decorative paper or fabric, or jazz it up with beads, 
buttons, or ribbon, the options are endless. I especially like thisstripe-y 
shade courtesy of <em>Martha Stewart Living</em> because its bright colors 
remind me of summertime. Or you can decorate several mini shades to dress up a 
ho-hum chandelier. This<em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> project will get you 
started. And blogger Dean Novosat explains the nitty gritty oflamp-shade 
decorating, such as making sure you select heat-resistant decorating materials.

<h3>Kitchen Design Trends</h3> 
<p><br>
 Kitchens of yesteryear used to be tiny, cramped spaces set apart from 
the rest of the house&mdash;hardly functional by today&rsquo;s standards. 
Luckily, those days are long gone, and the kitchen design industry is booming 
with trends that blend function with visual appeal. And with good reason: we 
use our kitchens for food prep, entertaining, dining, even paying the bills.</p>
<p>Though trends vary, remember this: Customized kitchens rule, so opt for 
fixtures, appliances, and designs that best fit your needs, lifestyle, and 
style preferences. Want to bring your kitchen up to speed? Get caught up with 
these kitchen design trends trends:</p> 
<p><strong>Stainless-steel sinks.</strong> If you already have stainless steel 
sinks, you deserve a round of applause&mdash;this is one trend that boasts 
serious staying power. If not, you may want to consider making the switch: Not 
only does stainless steel lend a contemporary edge, it&rsquo;s durable and can 
stand up to serious cooks and rowdy children alike. To take the trend a step 
further, go beyond standard sink shapes&mdash;look for prep sinks with a curvy 
outline or oversized single-bowl models. Read more aboutstainless steel sinks. 
And if stainless steel just isn&rsquo;t your thing, sinks made of natural 
materials such as copper, stone, and wood are also popular.</p> 
<p><strong>Concealed appliances</strong>. Hate the way your refrigerator 
sticks out like a sore thumb, but don&rsquo;t want to completely replace it? 
Worry not. Now you can have it blend in with your kitchen&rsquo;s more 
appealing features. Or you can have it serve as the room&rsquo;s focal 
point&mdash;but in a more visually appealing manner. From cabinetry-matching 
panels to magnetic panels, read more about cool ways todisguise your appliances.
<br> <strong><br>
 Universal design.</strong> In my kitchen, my step stool is 
my best friend, because almost all of the cabinets are out of my reach. With as 
much use as the kitchen gets, it&rsquo;s important that 
everyone&mdash;regardless of age or ability&mdash;should be able to access 
appliances and fixtures easily. That&rsquo;s where the universal design concept 
comes in. And it&rsquo;s a trend that boasts long-lasting benefits for everyone 
in your family. The key is to plan carefully. For example, you&rsquo;ll want to 
leave open space under the countertops. And to make hard-to-reach items at your 
fingertips, try mounting pegboard along one wall. But there&rsquo;s so much 
more to universal design. Transform your kitchen theuniversal design way. And 
check out the National Kitchen and Bath Association&rsquo;skitchen planning 
guidelines. If you're looking for additional universal design ideas, check out 
<em>Universal Design Ideas for Style, Comfort &amp; Safety</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Functional yet attractive lighting.</strong> Lighting is an 
essential element of any kitchen design scheme, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be 
all work and no play. In fact, lighting is one area where you don&rsquo;t want 
to skimp: Combine different types of general, task, and ambient lighting based 
on your lighting requirements. And give it a sophisticated twist: For example, 
you can hang pendant lights together or hang several at different heights, 
according to The Kitchen Designer. To really set your kitchen aglow, check out 
these other illuminating ideas fromThe Kitchen Designer.</p> 
<p>The world of kitchen design is bursting with trends, and I&rsquo;ve barely 
skimmed the surface. Stay tuned&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be back with more trends soon, 
such as including expanded office work areas in the kitchen.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, keep me posted with your favorite kitchen design trends.

<h3>Selecting Roofing</h3> 
<p><br>
 There are plenty of necessary components that comprise the exterior 
of your house. One of the most important? The roof. That&rsquo;s why selecting 
the right roofing for your home is such a vital part of the home-planning 
process.</p> 
<p><strong>Repair or Replace?</strong><br>
 If you&rsquo;re in the market for 
a new roof, you have two basic options, according to theNational Roofing 
Contractors Association. You can tear off your existing roof system and do a 
complete roof replacement or re-cover your existing roof system. If 
you&rsquo;ve already done one re-cover of your roof system, you&rsquo;ll likely 
have to go for a complete replacement, as most building codes only allow one 
roof system re-cover.</p> 
<p>If your roof existing roofing has sustained any damage or leaks, 
you&rsquo;ll likely want to remove the existing roof and repair the substrate 
before installing a new roof.</p> 
<p><strong>Roof System Components</strong><br>
 Even if you plan to hire 
someone else to handle your roof replacement, it&rsquo;s a good idea to know 
the basic components of your roof.</p> 
<p>Steep-slope roof systems (those with a slope of 25 percent or more) have 
five main parts, according to the National Roofing Contractors Association:</p> 
<p>1. Roof Covering. This consists of shingles, tile, slate, or metal, as well 
as an underlayment to protect the sheathing from weathering. (I&rsquo;ll post 
more about roofing materials soon!)</p> 
<p>2. Sheathing. The boards or sheet material that are fastened to the roof 
rafters to cover a house or building.</p> 
<p>3. Roof Structure. The structure includes the rafters and trusses 
constructed to support the sheathing.</p> 
<p>4. Flashing. To prevent water seepage, this sheet metal or other material 
is installed into the roof system&rsquo;s joints and valleys.</p> 
<p>5. Drainage. This is the shape, slope, and layout of the roof system, which 
affects its ability to shed water.</p> 
<p><strong>Style Considerations</strong><br>
 Your roof not only protects your 
home from the elements, it&rsquo;s also a major feature of your exterior. For 
that reason, you&rsquo;ll want to consider material selection carefully.</p> 
<p>How prominent is your roof? Large, steep roofs will have a much greater 
visual impact on the exterior home&mdash;and may require more careful selection 
of roofing materials style and color&mdash;than smaller, lower-sloped roofs 
that are less visible.</p> 
<p>Use your home&rsquo;s architecture as a starting point for narrowing down 
your roofing choices. For instance, tile is commonly found on Mediterranean- or 
Southwestern-style homes, while standing-seam metal roofing offers a more 
contemporary touch.</p> 
<p>Consider color too. Lighter roofing can make a house appear larger, while 
darker roofing can make larger houses seem less imposing. On the flip side, 
however, in an area with a lot of houses close together, light-color roofing 
may make the lots appear too crowded; and small houses appear even smaller when 
topped with dark roofs.</p> 
<p><strong>Cost</strong><br>
 How much your roofing material costs will, of 
course, be an important consideration. You will want to factor in your budget 
as well as the quality of materials&mdash;installing a quality roof that will 
last for years without problems or maintenance may be worth a bit of additional 
upfront cost. Average-quality asphalt shingles generally will be the least 
expensive option; clay tile and natural slate usually cost the most.</p> 
<p>Stay tuned&mdash;you&rsquo;ll learn more about these materials (and more!) 
in an upcoming post.</p>

 Until tomorrow,<br>

<h3>Storm and Screen Doors</h3> 
<p>Looking for an easy and effective weekend project? Why not replace that 
worn-out storm door? I have three that are in desperate need of some help, so I 
figured it was a good time to go shopping.</p> 
<p>Storm doors are relatively easy to install because they&rsquo;re typically 
sold as pre-hung units in standard door width&mdash;just screw them onto the 
existing doorjamb. Common models are hinged on either side, but if you&rsquo;re 
in the market for storm doors to fit in front of double doors you can find 
those too.</p> 
<p>When selecting a storm door, you&rsquo;ll need to determine the type and 
size of window as well as the screen system you&rsquo;d like. The easiest 
systems allow you to clip in glass panels or insect screening with ease. Or, to 
avoid replacing windows and screens altogether, look for models with panels 
that slide past one another on tracks or that store extra panels right in the 
door.</p> 
<p>Odds are if you have a striking red accent door you won&rsquo;t want to 
cover it up with a storm door made mostly of metal. Instead, opt for a 
full-height glass panel so your other door is fully visible. As a bonus, when 
the main door is open and the storm door is closed you&rsquo;ll allow maximum 
light into your home.</p> 
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re not opting for a glass-panel storm door and are 
worried your storm door will detract from the appearance of your home, 
don&rsquo;t be. If a standard storm door doesn&rsquo;t do the trick, one of the 
variety of more decorative styles now available is sure to suit your tastes. 
And if you&rsquo;re still not finding what you&rsquo;re looking for, you can 
design your own. Many manufacturers&mdash;likeLarson Storm Doors&mdash;allow 
you to mix and match the frame style and color, glass, and hardware of your 
choice.</p> 
<p>Of course the construction of the storm door is as much as&mdash;if not 
more&mdash;important than its appearance. Storm doors may be made of solid wood 
or boast a solid-wood core clad with steel or aluminum. Which you ultimately 
choose is a matter of taste and budget. In general, metal options will require 
less maintenance than wood but may dent more easily.</p> 
<p>Before purchasing a door, also inspect the quality of hardware and the 
corner joints, both of which can provide clues as to the quality of your 
door&rsquo;s construction.</p> 
<p>Home Tips provides some great information if you&rsquo;re looking to learn 
more. And once you get home with your new storm door, here&rsquo;s a handy 
video on how to install it, courtesy ofThis Old House.</p>

<h3>Childproof Your Yard</h3> 
<p><br>
 With spring in full swing and summer just around the corner, 
there&rsquo;s no better time to be outdoors, whether you&rsquo;re dining, 
entertaining, relaxing&mdash;or all three. And chances are, you&rsquo;ve got a 
host of family and friends out with you basking in the warm weather. But is 
your outdoor living space suited for guests of all ages? Even the most mundane 
items can potentially be safety hazards for little ones, so it&rsquo;s best to 
take precautions to ensure a safe, enjoyable summer for everyone.</p> 
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t childproofed your yard yet, now is the perfect time. 
Walk around your backyard and make note of potential dangers. Corral all tools 
and garden, lawn, and automotive equipment in a locked storage shed. Get 
started with these ideas fromSecurity World. And also pay attention to these 
specific elements common to most yards:</p> 
<p><strong>Surfaces.</strong> Make sure to provide an open, soft playing 
surface like grass for kids. You can also purchase impact-absorbing solid 
surfacing tiles or sheets made of rubber or synthetic compounds to cover 
expanses of hard surfaces such as concrete. Or place a layer of mulch, sand, or 
other soft materials under play equipment to cushion falls. A 9- to 12-inch 
layer is best.</p> 
<p><strong>Water features.</strong> Surround the area around pools, spas, and 
hot tubs with a secure, locked fence. As a general rule, these fences should be 
at least 4 to 5 feet high and have no gaps. And cover the water feature when 
it&rsquo;s not in use&mdash;motorized pool covers do the trick. Learn more about
protecting your pool.</p> 
<p><strong>Garden.</strong> It makes sense to get rid of poisonous plants and 
plants with sharp spines or thorns. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you still 
can&rsquo;t have fun with gardening&mdash;I used to love wandering around the 
garden with my mother, as she pointed out all different plant varieties and let 
me touch and smell them. Plant fun varieties such as snapdragons, sunflowers, 
and lamb&rsquo;s ear, which are kid-safe and beautiful. Also trybutterfly 
gardens or gardens with themes, such as a pizza garden. Here&rsquo;s how to 
plant a child-friendly garden. And check out these plant varieties, which are 
fun to touch.</p> 
<p><strong>Play structures.</strong> Swing sets and play areas entertain kids 
for hours, but it&rsquo;s essential that they&rsquo;re sturdy and safe. 
Regularly inspect the equipment for loose bolts, cracks, sharp edges, and other 
warning signs. The University of Michigan Health System explains moresafety tips
 for playground and outdoor structures.</p> 
<p><strong>Decks.</strong> Decks are ripe with outdoor living 
opportunities&mdash;just keep a few things in mind. If your deck is more than 
24 inches off the ground, you&rsquo;ll probably need a railing system. 
Guardrails should be at least 36 inches high above the deck surface. And make 
sure the space between railing posts is no more than 4 inches apart so a small 
child&rsquo;s head can&rsquo;t get stuck. If you&rsquo;ve got a multilevel deck 
with a long or steep stairway, be sure to install safety gates to prevent 
spills. For more specific information, check your local building codes.</p>

<h3>Color Scheme Inspiration</h3> 
<p><br>
 So you&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s time for a new color scheme. Now 
what? Begin by learning aboutcolor scheme basics and color and mood. Then, when 
it&rsquo;s time to find inspiration for your color scheme, try starting with 
and building on one of the following:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>A favorite color</li> 
<li>A classic combination (think blue and yellow or even red, white, and blue)
</li> 
<li>The hues of a great piece of fabric</li> 
<li>A fantastic piece of art (to see what I mean, check out this blog post 
about gleaning color scheme inspiration from the masters of painting)</li> 
<li>A favorite object (classic blue and white china often inspires kitchen or 
dining room color schemes; a colorful lamp from a garage sale might spark a 
whole room; even a favorite shirt or purse might stimulate your color 
imagination)</li> 
<li>Hues found in nature</li> 
<li>A magazine advertisement</li> </ul>You see? Color inspiration is 
everywhere. Open your eyes and take a look around&mdash;you might be surprised 
at what you discover!
<p></p> 
<p>Find more color inspiration from Benjamin Moore Paints and Home Decorating 
Made Easy. Also be sure to check out the ideas offered by Behr, which center on 
the practical, artistic, emotional, fashionable, and historical inspiration. 
And you can&rsquo;t beat tryingkuler.com, an online color scheme generator 
created by Adobe.</p>

<h3>Create an Outdoor Kitchen</h3> 
<p><br>
 With 70-degree weather like we&rsquo;re having right now, the last 
thing I want to do is cook inside. Or do anything inside, for that matter. 
That&rsquo;s what makes the thought of an outdoor kitchen so appealing. 
Although an outdoor kitchen might be as simple as a grill, there are plenty of 
options for creating an alfresco cooking space that functions just like your 
indoor kitchen.</p> 
<p>Include these components, which are pivotal for kitchen design indoors or 
out, and you&rsquo;ll be enjoying your new outdoor cooking space in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong>. Just like an indoor kitchen has myriad cabinets 
to corral dishes, food items, and the like, your outdoor kitchen should feature 
storage too. Of course, if your outdoor cooking space is located near your 
indoor kitchen, you can haul things back and forth. But having a few cabinets 
or a rolling cart allows you to stash frequently used items like grilling 
utensils and cleaning supplies right where they&rsquo;re needed. And with an 
undercounter fridge, you can even store beverages for entertaining and 
foodstuffs for grilling right where you need them too.</p> 
<p><strong>Food prep</strong>. Whether it&rsquo;s a rolling cart or a stretch 
of countertop, an easy-clean work surface is key for preparing and placing food 
as it goes on and off the grill. For even more food prep functionality, include 
a prep sink with a faucet so you have access to water for filling pots, 
cleaning veggies, and rinsing plates. Design note: Keep in mind that 
positioning your outdoor kitchen next to your house may make it possible to 
connect to your indoor plumbing, which can save on construction costs.</p> 
<p><strong>Cooking</strong>. The heart of the outdoor kitchen is, of course, 
the grill. But there are plenty of other grill features and additional cooking 
option worth considering too depending on how gourmet you want your outdoor 
cooking space to be. Many grills come with burners, which makes preparing side 
dishes outside a cinch (I used ours for making baked beans to accompany brats 
this weekend). Or how about a wood-burning oven, open fire pit, or smoker? 
Design note: Just as ventilation is important indoors, be sure to position your 
cooking area away from the house and facing such that the smoke moves away from 
your house and your guests.</p> 
<p><strong>Dining.</strong> Don&rsquo;t forget to include a dining set or 
picnic table on the patio or deck. In fact, you may want to offer a couple of 
seating arrangements if there&rsquo;s room, because once your outdoor kitchen 
is complete you&rsquo;ll likely want to entertain quite a lot!</p> 
<p><strong>Cleanup.</strong> After the party&rsquo;s over, make cleaning up a 
breeze by tossing food scraps in a garbage stashed under the countertop. 
Include a container for recycling bottles and cans as well. I&rsquo;ve seen 
exceptionally high-end outdoor kitchens that include dishwashers, but if 
that&rsquo;s out of your price range at the very least you can use your prep 
sink to rinse dishes before carrying them indoors.</p> 
<p>So there you have it. The basics to creating the perfect outdoor kitchen. 
Of course, to increase functionality even moreyou&rsquo;ll likely want to think 
about landscape lighting and additional amenities like speakers for listening 
to music. I&rsquo;ll try to post on more outdoor kitchen-related topics soon. 
In the meantime, here are a few sources of outdoor kitchen planning information 
to take your ideas even further:</p>

<h3>Outdoor Storage Ideas </h3> 
<p><br>
 Garages, basements, and attics can only hold so much stuff. And when 
it comes to storing outdoor essentials such as garden gear, patio furniture, 
and recreation equipment, who really wants to waste time digging around the 
basement? That&rsquo;s where outdoor storage options come into play&mdash;they 
corral your stuff where you need it most. Try these storage ideas:</p> 
<p><strong>Storage shed.</strong> These tried-and-true units are the most 
common form of outdoor storage&mdash;and they come in many shapes and sizes to 
fit even the smallest of yards. They&rsquo;re made from a variety of materials, 
such as wood, vinyl, and metal, and you have several installation options: you 
can purchase DIY kits, you can build one from scratch using mail-order plans, 
or you can hire someone to build it for you. Regardless of which route you 
choose,<em>This Old House</em> provides all the info you need to be 
storage-shed savvy.<br>
 Storage sheds&mdash;especially prefab ones&mdash;often 
get a bad rap for their not-so-attractive appearance. But today&rsquo;s sheds 
blend function with flair. Want to build a cottage-like shed that&rsquo;ll 
serve as the focal point of your yard (and wow your neighbors)? Check out the 
plans from<em>Popular Mechanic</em>. Or if you want to dress up an existing 
prefab shed,<em>Southern Living</em> shows how.</p> 
<p><strong>Under the deck.</strong> Have a multilevel deck? Don&rsquo;t let 
the space underneath go to waste. With the right prep, you can transform that 
under-deck area into a storage unit. The key is to keep everything protected 
from the elements&mdash;there&rsquo;s no point tossing a bunch of stuff under 
the deck if it&rsquo;s going to get soggy. Install avinyl covering or a

<p><strong>Garden bench</strong>. If you and your family spend a large chunk 
of time outdoors, or if you entertain frequently, chances are you can always 
use more seating. Benches with built-in storage allow you to get the best of 
both worlds. Storage benches come in a variety of finishes, so you can find one 
that matches your outdoor decor&mdash;just make sure it&rsquo;s water 
resistant. I especially like thisteak bench/trunk from Frontgate. Not only does 
it have an attractive finish, its slatted bottom lets fresh air circulate 
inside to deter icky mold or mildew growth.</p>

<h3>Window Styles</h3> 
<p><br>
 I recently wrote about some considerations to make when it&rsquo;s 
time toreplace your windows. One thing I didn&rsquo;t touch on in that post, 
however, is selecting the right window style to fit your house and needs. This 
can be particularly challenging because windows come in so many sizes and 
shapes&mdash;big, little, rectangular, circular, square, you name it.</p> 
<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s a rundown on the most common windows 
styles to help you pick out the ones that will look best on your home and fit 
your needs.</p> 
<p><strong>Single-hung</strong> windows have a traditional look akin to that 
of old-style sash windows. The bottom sash slides upward, while the top sash is 
permanently fixed.</p> 
<p><strong>Double-hung</strong> windows, much like their single-hung 
counterparts, boast traditional styling. The main difference is that with 
double-hung versions both sashes slide, so you can open the window from the top 
and bottom.</p> 
<p><strong>Sliding</strong> windows offer a more contemporary look. They, too, 
are available in single- or double-hung models, but in either case the sash 
moves horizontally rather than vertically. Sliding windows are often used in 
rooms that require egress.</p> 
<p><strong>Picture</strong> windows are fixed (they don&rsquo;t open). Because 
there are no sashes to get in the way, they allow uninterrupted views. Plus, 
fixed windows are usually less expensive and more energy efficient than ones 
that open.</p> 
<p><strong>Casement</strong> windows are hinged at the sides and open outward 
by pushing or cranking them open with a handle. They provide maximum 
ventilation.</p> 
<p><strong>Awning</strong> windows are hinged at the top and open outward. 
When the glass is tilted out, it protects the window much like an awning 
protects your house, so you can have fresh air even if it&rsquo;s raining 
outside.</p> 
<p><strong>Bay</strong> windows are often used to create a focal point on the 
home&rsquo;s exterior. The sashes are framed to bump out beyond the wall, often 
with three separate windows jointed at 45-degree angles.</p> 
<p><strong>Transom</strong> windows, which may be short awning windows or have 
fixed sashes, are typically mounted over casement or double-hung windows to 
allow in additional light.</p> 
<p>Want to learn more about window styles, finish materials, and more? Look no 
further than this article fromHometime.</p> 
<p>Window manufacturers are great sources of window information too. Milgard 
offers handy, basic illustrations of window styles and links to their windows 
that fit in each category. Or check out the offerings atAndersen Windows &amp; 
Doors and Pella.</p>

<h3>Lawn Mower Buying Guide</h3> 
<p>Ah, the lawn-mowing season is upon us. In many parts of the country the 
grass is already sprouting up in all its green glory, which means the first cut 
isn't far away.</p> 
<p>If you're in the market for a new mower to start off the season, here are a 
few questions to get you started.</p> 
<p><strong>What size?</strong><br>
 According to Greener Choices, if you have 
a small, flat lawn, a reel or walk-behind electric mower will probably do the 
trick. (No gas involved? Better for the environment? Sign me up.)</p> 
<p>For bigger lawns though, you'll want a gasoline-powered option. And for the 
biggest of lawns? Look for a riding lawn mower or tractor (or, better yet,
reduce your lawn size).</p> 
<p>Lowe's has a handy lawn-mower buying guide that breaks down some of the 
common terms and gives you a better idea of what mower is best for your terrain 
and yard size.</p> 
<p><strong>Self-propelled or push?</strong><br>
 Traditional push mowers are 
cheaper and less complex but require more muscle. Self-propelled mowers are 
pushed along by an engine, which means less work for you - an attractive option 
if you have a large or hilly yard.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Bag or no bag?</strong><br>
 Do you want to catch your grass 
clippings? If so, look for mowers with a rear-mounting catcher. If not, 
consider a thatching mower that grinds up the clippings essentially - you are 
creating fertilizer while you are cutting.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>What features are worth it?</strong><br>
 Of course budget 
comes into consideration. There are lots of fancy bells and whistles you can 
get if you have the cash - but that doesn't necessarily mean they are worth it. 
One that might be worth the price tag, according to Consumer Reports, is a 
three-in-one mower that can mulch grass, bag grass, and discharge it out the 
side. Others add-ons to consider: single-level height adjustment (so you can 
adjust the mower wheel height) and a blade-brake clutch (so you can safely stop 
the mower's blade without the entire engine shutting off).</p> 
<p>As with any big purchase, it's a good idea to do your research on product 
options before you head to the store. A mower can last 10 years or longer if 
you keep it in good shape, so it pays to pick the right one.Consumer Research 
has a handy article listing some product reviews to get you started. And you 
can't beat the information provided by Consumer Reports either. Even if you 
don't have a subscription, you can still access some handy general 
recommendations on theirwebsite.</p>

<h3>Creative Framing</h3> 
<p>In the grand scheme of decorating, few things make a home (or tiny 
apartment, in my case) feel more welcoming than a bunch of framed pictures 
artfully hung on the wall or dispersed on bookshelves, mantels, and tables. And 
when you&rsquo;re stuck with boring beige walls like mine, framed art can make 
a world of difference. Break out your hammer and nails: It&rsquo;s time to pull 
your favorite photos out of hiding and frame them for everyone to see.</p> 
<p>So where should you put all those photos? Drab expanses of walls in 
stairwells, behind the sofa, and in other spaces are framing opportunities too 
good to pass up&mdash;try creating a cool collage with frames of different 
shapes and sizes. The key is to pick frames and mats with similar finishes for 
a more unified look.</p> 
<p>Also keep photos at eye level and make sure they&rsquo;re not too close 
together, but not too far apart, either.BHG.com explains how to jazz up empty 
wall space in a way that&rsquo;s tasteful, not overdone. And while you&rsquo;re 
at it, check out these pointers fromiVillage.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to mess up when hanging a picture&mdash;perhaps 
you&rsquo;re off by just a few millimeters. Or maybe that picture looks too 
small behind the sofa. Luckily, you can goof-proof picture 
hanging&mdash;without accidentally nailing holes in your walls&mdash;by tracing 
different frame arrangements on craft paper first.HGTV explains how.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to make an artistic statement with your frames, 
give your photos and art a funky edge with these cool frames:</p> 
<p>The Magnetic Photo Frame Clock allows you to insert wallet-size photos 
around the clock face&mdash;a perfect solution for putting those school photos 
to good use. And it makes telling time a lot more interesting, too. $39.98. Or 
try this standingMulti-Square Frame Clock from Wrapables. $27.95</p> 
<p>Since I live in an apartment where floor space is limited, I appreciate the 
Ladder Floor Screen Frame from Target. The vertical frame holds five 8x10 
photos and has a stylish black finish. $99.99.</p> 
<p>Made from an old LP, the Vinylux LP Picture Frame at 3rliving holds a 5x5 
photo and brims with retro style&mdash;and it&rsquo;s versatile too. Hang it on 
the wall or stand it on an end table. Check out other earth-friendly frames at 
3rliving too. $24.00.</p> 
<p>Serve up style with this cool wooden serving tray from Wrapables, which 
allows you to reminisce as you eat breakfast in bed. The tray holds one 4x6 
photo and four 3x3 photos. $24.95.</p> 
<p>For an unexpected twist, why not hang photos from the ceiling? 
Target&rsquo;sTen-Photo Mobile allows you to do just that. $8.99.</p> 
<p>What other funky frames do you recommend?</p> 
<p>Until tomorrow,</p>

<h3>Luxury Bathroom Items</h3> 
<p> <br>
DTV II. Photo courtesy of Kohler Co.</p> The kitchen and bath design 
industry never ceases to amaze me. Just when I&rsquo;m enamored with one 
luxury&mdash;say, radiant-heat flooring&mdash;something completely new (like 
2-way mirrors with televisions) sweeps me off my feet. Check out a few of these 
luxury items guaranteed to transform your bathroom into a space that wows.
<p><strong>Beach vacation.</strong> Soak in the Teuco Seaside Whirlpool Tub 
long enough, and you might just think you&rsquo;re seaside. You can enjoy 
hydrotherapy in the comforts of your home, thanks to the tub&rsquo;s 
moonlights, integral waterfall, cushy headrest, and heater. And if that 
weren&rsquo;t cool enough, the tub&rsquo;s wooden surround boasts a large 
built-in shelf.</p> 
<p><strong>All in one.</strong> Few things are as cozy as chasing away 
post-shower chills with a warm towel. And there&rsquo;s nothing quite like 
watching television from the tub. But enjoying the two comforts together? 
That&rsquo;s where theAquavision Towel Rail TV comes in. This sleek unit 
features a waterproof 17&rdquo; LCD TV behind a mirror panel with an attached 
towel rail. When the TV is off, the glass looks like a mirror. And when the TV 
is on, the glass is clear so you can catch up on your favorite programs. Pretty 
nifty, huh?<br>
 Of course, if you prefer to soak with an exhilarating book but 
still love warm towels, try these decorative towel racks fromWesaunard.</p> 
<p><strong>Closed off.</strong> While scanning the <em>This Old House</em> 
Hardware Aisle blog, I couldn&rsquo;t help but be intrigued byOve Integral 
Shelving&mdash;a shelf-like compartment inside the shower that&rsquo;s closed 
off by a door so bar soaps and towels don&rsquo;t become soggy messes. The 
shelf fits neatly into the corner of the shower&mdash;and it&rsquo;s attractive 
too.</p> 
<p><strong>Fountain of youth.</strong> Slow the aging process of skin and 
hair? It&rsquo;s possible by reducing chlorine and other free radicals from 
your shower system, according to Wellness Enterprises. And that&rsquo;s just 
what theWellness Shower does&mdash;in fact, it reduces chlorine three times 
longer than the average shower filter and increases hydration of skin and hair. 
Even better: it reduces bacteria and fungus growth.</p> 
<p><strong>Ultimate shower experience.</strong> The bathroom is a haven for 
relaxation at the end of a long day, and theKohler DTV II custom shower system 
takes relaxation to the next level. As if setting customized temperature and 
water delivery options and grooving to your favorite tunes weren&rsquo;t cool 
enough, you&rsquo;ll reap the benefits of chromatherapy too.</p> 
<p>All of these items beg the question: What&rsquo;s next in the world of bath 
design? What would you like to see? Share here.</p>

<h3>Organize It: Clothes Closets</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I think it&rsquo;s time to get out the 
spring clothes and banish my sweaters to the basement for another year. (Of 
course, the fact that there was a chance of snow last weekend should deter me, 
but it&rsquo;s spring so I&rsquo;m going to forge ahead anyway!)</p> 
<p>While I&rsquo;m swapping out my wardrobe, I figure it&rsquo;s a great time 
to bone up on some closet-organizing pointers. Here are a few keys for keeping 
your clothes closet in shape:</p> 
<p><strong>Declutter first.</strong> Of course! I plan on removing everything 
from my closet, piling it all on my bed, and sorting everything into piles. 
It&rsquo;s thesave, toss, or donate approach I&rsquo;m so fond of. One pile 
will go to the thrift store, another will get stored until next year, and a 
third will go back in the closet. The goal, according toLowe&rsquo;s, should be 
to leave about 15 percent of your closet space free. (Then you have an excuse 
to go shopping!)</p> 
<p><strong>Get rid of wire hangers.</strong> Before you put a single garment 
back in your closet, toss those crappy wire hangers you&rsquo;re using. 
They&rsquo;re free from the dry cleaner for a reason. Instead, invest in 
quality wood and padded hangers. What to do with the old wire ones?Unclutterer 
has the answer.</p> 
<p><strong>Store frequently used items at the right height.</strong> As you 
begin returning things to your closet, make certain the clothes, accessories, 
and shoes that see the most frequent use are stored between shoulder- and 
knee-height. That way it&rsquo;s easy to spot things, get them out, and return 
them to their proper place.</p> 
<p><strong>Double up</strong>. Even if your closet is tiny, you can pack twice 
as many clothes in it if you install double rods. A common arrangement is to 
hang blouses and jackets on the top and skirts and pants on the bottom. Or 
forgo that second rod in favor of some portable drawers, shoe racks, open 
shelves, or other organization tools for taking advantage of that floor space.
</p> 
<p><strong>Reach for it.</strong> Use hard-to-reach space at the top of the 
closet for storing out-of-season or infrequently worn items. It&rsquo;s the 
perfect spot to stash scarves until next winter or that box containing your 
wedding dress until &hellip; well, until you feel the need to see if you can 
still fit in it.</p> 
<p><strong>Use tools.</strong> Hanging rods aren&rsquo;t the only means of 
storing items in your closet. Stash purses, accessories, and such in small 
baskets or canvas storage bins. Those over-the-door shoe holders can be used 
for holding all sorts of smaller items&mdash;and shoes too, of course. Tie 
racks, belt hooks, and hanging shelves all come in handy too. Shop around at
Spacesavers and The Container Store for ideas.</p> 
<p><strong>Think outside the closet.</strong> You can only fit so much in a 
closet, regardless of the organizational pointers you press into use. So take 
advantage of other available space&mdash;behind the door, underneath the bed, 
even outside the bedroom&mdash;for items that won&rsquo;t fit in the closet. 
(And if you have a giant walk-in closet and still can&rsquo;t fit everything? 
See the first pointer above&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to downsize!)</p> 
<p>Looking to learn more? You can&rsquo;t beat all the closet organization 
pointersReal Simple offers. And Life Organizers provides a slew of articles on 
creating a happy, tidy closet. Although thisOrganized Home article was written 
for autumn, it applies just as nicely to spring too.</p> 
<p>If your closet clutter is so overwhelming that you don&rsquo;t think 
you&rsquo;ll be able to tackle it on your own,Simply Stated provides info to 
help you figure out when it&rsquo;s time to hire help.</p> 
<p>Keep reading too&mdash;soon we&rsquo;ll post on great products to help you 
keep everything in your closet in place.</p>

<h3>Rain Water Harvesting</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Whether you live in an area hard-hit by drought, are looking to save money 
on your water bills, or just want to conserve water because it&rsquo;s a 
precious resource (or all three!), perhaps this spring it&rsquo;s time to 
harvest rain water and use it around your house. I plan to do so within the 
next couple of weeks. Here&rsquo;s why&mdash;and how you can too.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Why bother?</strong><br>
 Did you know that in the summer, as 
much as 40 percent of a homeowner&rsquo;s water use goes to the yard? Why not 
replace some of that water coming from the outdoor faucet with rainwater?</p> 
<p>Just think of all the rainwater that washes away each time it pours (like 
it is right now here, by the way). According to the U.S. EPA, a rain barrel can 
save a single homeowner about 1,300 gallons of water during the peak summer 
months. That&rsquo;s a lot of water for very little money or work. Plus, 
harvesting that water means less of it ends up in your sewer treatment 
facility&mdash;and you&rsquo;re helping to keep river, beaches, and the like a 
bit cleaner (because that water runoff often picks up some nasty contaminants 
and litter on its way). Oh, and did I mention that naturally softened rainwater 
is great for water plants, cleaning your car, or even washing windows? It 
is&mdash;you just can&rsquo;t drink it!</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re not convinced, learn more about why rain barrels are great 
fromHarvestH20.com.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>How do I start?</strong><br>
 Making your own rain barrel is a 
pretty darn easy DIY project&mdash;all you really need is a large food-quality 
barrel or even a big plastic garbage can with a lid. You&rsquo;ll need to make 
a hole in the lid for the gutter connector and a hole near the bottom of the 
can where you&rsquo;ll want to screw in a spigot. But, essentially, 
that&rsquo;s it.</p> 
<p>Lucky for you, there are lots of resources online to help you with the 
steps. Check out the easy instructions provided bySouthwest Florida Water 
Management District or the City of Bremerton, Washington (you can even download 
their handy brochure).</p> 
<p>In case you&rsquo;re like me and like to shop around for how-to info, I 
thought I&rsquo;d include a few more sites with step-by-step pointers:HGTV, DIY 
Network, Naturalrainwater.com (I love the illustrations here) are three that 
will have you in the know. And you can&rsquo;t beat<em>Garden Gate</em> 
magazine&rsquo;scomprehensive guide.</p> 
<p>If you really don&rsquo;t want to make your own barrel, you can also buy one
, of course.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s that you say? You don&rsquo;t want your water catchment system 
out in the open? Well then here&rsquo;s a terrific idea Michelle Kaufmann 
posted onInstructables: make your barrel part of your garden. Looks good, 
doesn&rsquo;t it?</p> 
<p>This weekend, I&rsquo;m going to buy a Watersaver downspout rainwater 
diverter and make a homemade barrel to use with it. Who&rsquo;s with me?</p> 
<p><br>
 Until Monday, <br>

<h3>Spring Outdoor Maintenance</h3> 
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, you&rsquo;re probably in the process 
ofgetting your garden in gear for spring. Because you&rsquo;re going to be 
working outdoors, now&rsquo;s the perfect time to whip the exterior of your 
home into shape too&mdash;after all, it&rsquo;s probably taken quite a beating 
from the harsh winter weather. To get started, check out these general ideas for
cleaning up your outdoor surroundings. This handy spring project checklist from 
<em>Consumer Reports</em> will help you stay on track. And here are three 
exterior-improvement areas you&rsquo;ll want to pay particular attention to:</p>
<p><strong>Fix your fence.</strong> Even if you&rsquo;ve got the rest of your 
landscape looking snazzy, a rotting or damaged fence can easily turn your yard 
into an eyesore, erasing all your hard work (and probably annoying your 
neighbors). Doesn&rsquo;t seem fair, does it? Luckily, fence repair is an easy 
DIY project, according toBe Jane. Even if your fence doesn&rsquo;t show 
telltale signs of disrepair, there are still a few preventative steps you can 
take to lengthen its lifespan, such as painting or staining it each year, and 
trimming excess vegetation away from the fence.<br>
 Wanting to build a fence? 
AOL Home Improvement EditorTom Kraeutler walks you through the process. If 
you&rsquo;re not sure what style you want&mdash;picket, privacy, etc.&mdash;this
<em>This Old House</em> article can help you narrow your selection.</p> 
<p><strong>Get serious about siding.</strong> When checking out your siding, 
look for cracks, loose seams, buckling, bulging sections, and anything else 
that looks amiss.Ehow explains how to inspect your existing siding. <br>
 
Because there are so many different types of siding&mdash;from aluminum to 
wood&mdash;problems vary from house to house. Regardless of what type of siding 
you have,Do It Yourself is a good go-to guide for repair help. But if the 
damage is extensive, it might be wise tocall in a pro.</p> 
<p><strong>Examine your roof.</strong> Though it&rsquo;s commonly advised to 
inspect your roof before the onslaught of winter, it&rsquo;s also wise to check 
it after too. And if you&rsquo;re afraid of heights, no worries&mdash;all you 
need is a good pair of binoculars to scan your roof from all sides. ThisOregon 
State University Extension Service checklist will help you determine what to 
look for&mdash;following the suggestions on it can help prevent nasty mold 
growth and leaks (as if missing shingles weren&rsquo;t bad enough!).<br>
 Also 
make sure to clear all debris from the roof&rsquo;s surface, replace damaged 
shingles, refresh old or deteriorated caulking, and trim back tree branches 
that hang over the roof. For more information on all things roof-related, check 
outRoofhelp. And while you&rsquo;re at it, you&rsquo;ll want to inspect your 
gutters too.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about storm and screen doors either! Check back later 
this month&mdash;Julie will have the scoop.</p>

<h3>Eco-Friendly Wallpaper Options</h3> 
<p> <br>
<em>Butterfly Jubilee</em> <br>
Vinyl-Free Wallpaper <br>

courtesy of<br>
Mod Green Pod</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve already gotten the lowdown on removing wallpaper and using 
wallpaper creatively. So why not update your walls (and create cool DIY 
decorating projects) with eco-friendly wallpaper? Today&rsquo;s green wallpaper 
selections allow you to dress your walls in style and do your part to save the 
environment.</p> 
<p><strong>Pattern panache.</strong> Standard wallpaper has a harmful PVC 
coating. But then again,Mod Green Pod wallpaper isn&rsquo;t your average paper. 
Available in a variety of funky, fresh prints&mdash;think large-scale, modern 
versions of damask, hip hues, and butterfly silhouettes&mdash;vinyl-free Mod 
Green Pod wallpaper is made with water-based, non-toxic inks. Oh, and did I 
mention that it has a non-toxic, water-based glaze that&rsquo;s easy to clean 
so it&rsquo;s just as durable as it is cool? While you&rsquo;re at it, check 
out their line of fabrics, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Distinct dimension.</strong> Add instant texture to any room with 
MIO wallpapers. Available in four modern patterns, MIO wallcoverings provide 
acoustic dampening qualities too (style and substance rolled into 
one&mdash;wow!). And they come in four colors: natural, white, mint, and 
orange. If these colors just don&rsquo;t mesh with your decorating scheme, no 
worries! You can paint them to your heart&rsquo;s content. Now for the best 
part: Not only are they made from 100 percent post- and pre-consumer waste 
paper, you can take them straight to the recycling center when you decide to 
change your look. Plus $32 for 12 tiles, these are just as friendly on your 
wallet as they are on the environment.</p> 
<p><br>
<em>Pumice</em> <br>
Dial Tones Natural Wallcoverings. <br>

courtesy ofPallas Textiles.</p> 
<p><strong>Paper trail.</strong> Sure, your phone book is your go-to guide 
when you have a pizza craving. But did you know those pages you browse also 
make a fully functional wallpaper too?Pallas Textiles&rsquo; Dial Tones 
wallcoverings are made of 50 to 70 percent recycled telephone book paper. And 
they come in six neutral colors, from linen to pumice.</p> 
<p><strong>Nature inspired.</strong> OK. So maybe the bamboo, jute, raffia, 
cork, and other natural wallcoverings from Phillip Jeffries Ltd. aren&rsquo;t 
straight-up wallpaper. But they&rsquo;re just as cool&mdash;and they provide a 
unique blend of color and texture in one neat package. Plus, many of these 
wallcoverings are made from renewable products, too.</p> 
<p>And don&rsquo;t just stop with earth-friendly paper. Make the application 
process healthy as well by ditching toxic wallpaper paste in favor of safe, 
homemadewallpaper paste.</p>

<h3>Increase Your Fridge's Energy Efficiency</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The refrigerator is the biggest energy hog in the kitchen&mdash;and it uses 
almost 14 percent of your home&rsquo;s electricity too! If you&rsquo;re in the 
market for a new refrigerator, be sure to look for one with anEnergy Star label
, which means you&rsquo;re buying a fridge that consumes 15 percent less energy 
than required by current federal standards. According to Energy Star, replacing 
a refrigerator bought in 1990 with an Energy Star-qualified model can save 
enough energy to light the average household for nearly four months. Wow!</p> 
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not in the market for a new refrigerator, however, you 
can save a considerable amount of energy by making a few smart moves. What are 
you waiting for? Try them today!</p> 
<p><strong>Cut down on door opening.</strong> Every time you dig around for a 
snack, you&rsquo;re letting cold air escape from your refrigerator. Save energy 
by minimizing how long you keep the door open.</p> 
<p><strong>Cool foods first.</strong> Before you stick tonight&rsquo;s 
leftovers in the fridge, let them sit on the countertop until they&rsquo;re 
cool. That way your fridge doesn&rsquo;t have to kick in to help cool them to 
the right temperature.</p> 
<p><strong>Adjust the temperature.</strong> Keep your refrigerator compartment 
between 35 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit and your freezer compartment at 0 degrees 
Fahrenheit.</p> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget to defrost.</strong> Your unit has to work 
harder if there&rsquo;s frost buildup in the freezer (or fridge, for that 
matter). If ice buildup reaches more than one-quarter inch, it&rsquo;s time to 
defrost.</p> 
<p><strong>Position it wisely.</strong> Other items in the kitchen that give 
off heat&mdash;like the microwave, oven, and toaster&mdash;can affect the 
energy efficiency of your fridge. Position it as far away from these appliances 
as possible. And while you&rsquo;re at it, make sure your fridge isn&rsquo;t 
pushed right up against the wall so there&rsquo;s room for air to circulate 
behind it.</p> 
<p><strong>Check the seal.</strong> You&rsquo;re wasting precious cold air if 
your door doesn&rsquo;t seal tightly. Close the door over a piece of 
paper&mdash;if you can pull the paper out easily with the door closed, 
it&rsquo;s time to replace the rubber gasket or adjust the door latch.The 
Family Handyman can show you how to fix the gasket yourself.</p> 
<p><strong>Clean it inside and out.</strong> Cleaning out old food and wiping 
down shelves and drawers regularly is just good maintenance. Once a year, you 
should also pull your refrigerator away from the wall to vacuum the condenser 
coils. This helps the refrigerator cool more efficiently and run less 
frequently. Learn how fromHome Tips.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more info on improving your fridge&rsquo;s 
energy efficiency, visit the website of theAmerican Council for an 
Energy-Efficient Economy. While you&rsquo;re at it, learn how to keep your 
refrigerator in tip-top shape thanks toHowstuffworks.</p> 
<p>(And if you do upgrade or decide to get rid of that additional 
energy-hogging fridge or freezer in the garage or basement, be sure torecycle 
your old fridge.)</p> 
<p>What other smart moves do you make to save refrigerator energy? Are there 
any other spots around the house where you&rsquo;d like to learn to use less 
energy or water? If so, let me know!</p>

<h3>Organic Mattresses</h3> 
<p>Caution: Read this and you may want to toss your synthetic mattress out the 
door in favor of an organic mattress. And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p> 
<p>Why? Because when you sleep on an organic mattress, you likely will sleep 
more soundly &mdash; not only because it&rsquo;s comfortable, but also because 
you can rest easy knowing the materials you&rsquo;re sleeping on are better for 
you and the environment.</p> 
<p>Synthetic mattresses have a number of downsides. Most are made with 
materials derived from petrochemicals, which are prone to combustion and can 
off-gas toxic elements that you may inhale while you sleep. In addition, many 
are covered with chemical flame-retardants that can cause health problems 
(think reproductive and developmental issues&mdash;yuck).</p> 
<p>Organic mattresses aren&rsquo;t made with toxic chemicals and are 
hypoallergenic, which is ideal for people with allergies or chemical 
sensitivities. And many are naturally flame retardant. Plus organic mattresses 
haven&rsquo;t been produced with pesticide-ridden cotton or wool.</p> 
<p>Oh, and have I mentioned that they last longer?</p> 
<p>Organic mattresses may be made from natural latex rubber, organic cotton, 
or organic wool. Latex rubber is chemical free, naturally repels dust mites, 
resists mold and mildew, and supports the natural alignment of your spine. 
Organic wool wicks away body moisture, allowing you to maintain a comfortable 
body temperature while you sleep. Learn even more about the benefits of organic 
mattress materialshere.</p> 
<p>Although organic mattresses often are a bit pricier than synthetic options, 
isn&rsquo;t buying a quality mattress an investment in your health and life? 
But don&rsquo;t just take my word for it. Get more information about the 
benefits and drawbacks of organic mattresses fromMattress Guru. Green Eggs and 
Planet has some great info too (and a great blog name to boot). And if 
you&rsquo;re contemplating buying, be sure to read this exceptionally useful 
post onA Child Grows in Brooklyn. Oh, and how about one more article on the 
topic fromMother Jones while I&rsquo;m at it?</p> 
<p>Search for &ldquo;organic mattresses&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find a slew of 
options. Just remember, as with anything that&rsquo;s labeled organic, 
it&rsquo;s important to do your research so you don&rsquo;t get duped into 
buying a mattress that may have some organic materials but isn&rsquo;t 100 
percent organic.</p> 
<p>While you&rsquo;re at it, how about some organic bedding? I&rsquo;ll let 
Ideal Bite tell you why it&rsquo;s a good idea&mdash;and will post more about 
it soon!</p> 
<p><br>

<h3>Pet-Proofing Your Home</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The bathroom doors at my parents&rsquo; house are always shut. Why? Because 
our curious toy poodle, Lucky, has an interesting affinity for all things paper 
and enjoys shredding tissues. My best friend&rsquo;s mother can&rsquo;t keep 
food on the countertop, or their black lab lunges for it. That&rsquo;s why 
taking preventative pet-proofing measures can keep your pets happy, safe, 
healthy&mdash;and out of trouble.</p> 
<p>Just as you&rsquo;d childproof your home, you should make your house safe 
for your pets, too. And luckily, many of the approaches used for childproofing 
can be applied to pet-proofing too. For example, if Fido has mastered the art 
of nosing his way into your cabinets, try adding childproof locks. And to keep 
small pets from getting into trouble in off-limits areas around the house, 
install child safety gates. ThisSuite 101 article explains more. </p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to analyze each room for potential 
dangers&mdash;and to get down on all fours to see hazards from your pet&rsquo;s 
perspective. The American Humane Society is chockfull ofroom-by-room tips. So 
is theSeattle Times.</p> 
<p>In each room, be on the lookout for:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sharp edges and objects</li> 
<li>Small objects that can induce choking</li> 
<li>Electrical cords</li> 
<li>Open trash cans</li> 
<li>Medications</li> 
<li>Food</li> 
<li>Houseplants</li> </ul>Are you planning to remodel your house? Factor your 
pet into the renovation plans by selecting stain-resistant fabrics and 
carpeting, adding disguised litter boxes, and more. (And if you have any other 
cool ideas, share &rsquo;em here!)
<p></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s just as important to take your pet-friendly attitude outside, 
too. Because chances are, if you have a dog, it spends quite a bit of time 
outdoors. So if you spray fertilizer, for example, keep pets away for at least 
24 hours after application. Yesterday, I posted about the benefits of mulching. 
But if you have a dog, be wary of cocoa-shell mulch, which contains toxic 
theobromine. If you want the benefits of cocoa mulch without the harmful side 
effects, make sure you select a variety that&rsquo;s theobromine-free. Read up 
on more ways to make yourlandscape more dog-friendly.</p>

<h3>Mad for Mulching</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s one of the best&mdash;and easiest&mdash;things you can do to 
keep your plants in tip-top shape this spring? Mulch. Topping your plants with 
a layer of mulch protects roots from heat, cold, and drought. Mulching a host 
of other benefits, too:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Conserves soil moisture</li> 
<li>Reduces weed growth</li> 
<li>Improves soil structure</li> 
<li>Adds a polished, neat touch to your landscape</li> </ul> 
<p>And that just skims the surface. Learn more about the benefits of mulching 
from thisOhio State University Extension Fact Sheet.</p> 
<p>The possibilities for mulch materials are endless. Mulch varieties fall 
into one of two categories: Organic and inorganic. Organic mulch&mdash;think 
bark, wood chips, grass clippings, and shredded hardwood, to name a 
few&mdash;decomposes into the soil over time to add vital nutrients and needs 
to be replaced on occasion. As you might have guessed, inorganic 
varieties&mdash;recycled rubber, crushed stone, landscape cloth, and 
more&mdash;don&rsquo;t offer any nutritional benefits to the soil but are often 
more long-lasting.</p> 
<p>Want to learn more about different type of mulches&mdash;as well as their 
pros and cons? Check out thisThis Old House photo gallery showcasing mulch 
materials. And if you still can&rsquo;t decide between an organic or inorganic 
mulch, thisHGTV article provides insight&mdash;and also addresses other 
mulch-related issues such as selecting light or dark materials.</p> 
<p>Too much mulch can be a bad thing&mdash;especially during early spring, 
when an overly thick layer could slow the warming process. That&rsquo;s why 
it&rsquo;s best to wait until mid to late spring to apply it. When working with 
finer materials, a 1- to 2-inch layer should be sufficient; for thicker 
mulches, try a 3- to 4-inch layer. And avoid piling mulch up against tree bark 
or the stems of woody plants. Bone up ongeneral guidelines for mulch application
, courtesy of the United States Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Natural 
Resources Conservation Service. This Clemson University Extension detailedinfo 
guide is also handy. Better yet, if you know the dimensions of the space 
you&rsquo;re working with, thismulch calculator from Lowe&rsquo;s takes the 
guesswork out of the whole process.</p> 
<p>One type of mulch&mdash;cocoa mulch&mdash;is touted for being a fabulous 
soil amendment and pest deterrent. But because it&rsquo;s made from cocoa 
shells, it&rsquo;s dangerous for pets&mdash;especially dogs. So is it possible 
to get the best of both worlds? Stay tuned&mdash;in tomorrow&rsquo;s post, 
I&rsquo;ll address how to pet-proof your home.</p>

<h3>Decorating Styles: Country</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Our gradual journey through popular decorating styles continues. 
You&rsquo;ve already learned about traditional style. (What? You haven&rsquo;t? 
Well, you&rsquo;re in luck. You can catch uphere.) So now The Home Know-It-All 
is going country.</p> 
<p>Just like about every decorating style, country is hard to define. It has 
evolved so much over the years&mdash;and is continually changing even 
today&mdash;that to say<em>this</em> is country and <em>that</em> is not 
doesn&rsquo;t get you very far. In some homes, you may find rustic furniture 
and folk art. In others, you may find a fresher version of country style 
that&rsquo;s simple, practical, and relaxed. Collections are common but also 
vary depending on your definition of country&mdash;is it baskets, Americana, 
and folk art? Or colored glass jars, handmade fabrics, and furnishings with 
distressed finishes? Could be any or all of the above. Or something I 
didn&rsquo;t even mention.</p> 
<p>To help you figure out which country decorating style is right for you, 
take thisBHG.com quiz. I took it and expected the results to say 
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not country at all.&rdquo; Rather, I&rsquo;m 70 percent 
modern country, 20 percent eclectic country, and 10 percent country cottage. 
(As in, no country clutter here, folks.) I can buy those results.</p> 
<p>Not sure how to describe the country style you want? In addition to modern 
and eclectic country, don&rsquo;t forget aboutshabby chic, cottage, and rustic. 
They&rsquo;re all options depending on your tastes. (I didn&rsquo;t find any 
useful sites on rustic decorating&mdash;so if you know of any good ones let me 
know!)</p> 
<p>To me, country style is friendly. It&rsquo;s casual. It can be tailored to 
fit your tastes and your lifestyle&mdash;no cowboy boots required. (Though you 
can wear them if you want to.)</p> 
<p>Want to learn more? You&rsquo;ll find pointers at the Decorating Country 
Home website. And of course, you can&rsquo;t go wrong by going straight to the 
sources for modern country style&mdash;<em>Country Home</em> and <em>Country 
Living</em> magazines.</p> 
<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. What&rsquo;s your take on country style? What 
other decorating styles do you prefer?</p>

 Until tomorrow,<br>

<h3>Kitchen Sinks with Character</h3> 
<p> <br>
Assure(TM) Barrier-Free Kitchen Sink. <br>

Co.</p> 
<p>A kitchen just wouldn&rsquo;t be a kitchen without a sink. Best of all, in 
the wonderful, ever-changing world of kitchen design, innovative new sink 
styles are constantly popping up&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see more 
than one sink in modern kitchens. Changing up your sink style is an easy way to 
add instant personality (and function!) to your kitchen. Check out these nifty 
sink models:</p> 
<p><strong>Make a Splash.</strong> Entertain often? Wow guests with 
Elkay&rsquo;sMystic Entertainment Sink MYSTIC5014C, which features an organic 
wave shape&mdash;perfect for contemporary kitchens. The sculptural bowl 
(basically a work of art itself!) boasts a lustrous satin finish, and 
it&rsquo;s made of ultra-durable 16-gauge steel. But there&rsquo;s more to it 
than good looks: use it to wash fruits and veggies, and fill it with ice to 
keep beverages chilled. Prices vary.</p> 
<p><strong>Glamorous Glass.</strong> Who says glass sinks are strictly for the 
bathroom?JSG Oceana undermount models prove glass sinks have a rightful place 
in the kitchen too. These gems come in 17 glistening hues&mdash;from White 
Smoke to Sunset. Made from the company&rsquo;s signature &ldquo;Hard Roc&rdquo; 
glass, they stand up to stains, scratches, and thermal shocks. Prices vary.</p> 
<p> <br>
PRO TaskCenter. <br>

<p><strong>All-in-One.</strong> Prep, cook, and clean in the same spot? Yes, 
it&rsquo;s an option, thanks toKohler&rsquo;s PRO CookCenter and TaskCenter 
lines, which offer amenities such as a cooking vessel, cutting boards, 
double-basin sink, disposal basin, left-hand drainboard, and more. A 
stainless-steel finish gives these units a professional edge&mdash;perfect for 
serious cooks. Prices vary based on model.</p> 
<p><strong>Universally Designed.</strong> I can&rsquo;t say enough about the 
benefits of auniversally designed kitchen. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a fan of 
Kohler&rsquo;sAssure barrier-free sinks which allows you to stand or sit while 
working at the sink. The smart sink teams a deep work basin and a small 
prep/disposal basin for total convenience&mdash;and comes in a variety of 
colors to complement your kitchen. Prices start at $768.00.</p> 
<p><strong>Roomy Sink.</strong> When it comes to main sinks, bigger really is 
better. And there&rsquo;s not much this 33&rdquo; x 22&rdquo;-inchAmerican 
Standard Large Single Bowl Kitchen Sink can&rsquo;t hold&mdash;whether 
it&rsquo;s a mountain of dishes or the largest cookie sheets. And its porcelain 
finish resists heat damage. Prices vary from $312 to $434, based on color.</p> 
<p>If you could design your dream sink, what elements would it include? </p>
