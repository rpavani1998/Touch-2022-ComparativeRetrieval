<h3>Basic turfgrass requirements</h3> Saturday, January 14th, 2012 
<p>A question often asked of students studying turfgrass management is 
&ldquo;Which of the following &ndash; light, temperature, water, atmospheric 
carbon dioxide or nutrition &ndash; is most important for turfgrass 
survival?&rdquo; One correct answer is, &ldquo;All are equally important.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Light.</strong></p> 
<p>Turfgrasses capture light energy and use it to produce compounds that can 
be stored in reserve for use at a later date. They produce carbohydrates 
through photosynthesis, the combination of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from 
carbon dioxide and water in the presence of light. Photosynthesis cannot occur 
without an appropriate amount of light of specific (e.g., red, violet and blue) 
wavelengths. Aerial shoots of healthy, actively growing turfgrasses reflect 
green light, contributing to the turf&rsquo;s color.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Temperature.</strong></p> 
<p>Turfgrass seed germination<strong> </strong>and growth are restricted to a 
specific range<strong> </strong>of temperatures. Turfgrass species are broadly 
categorized as warm-season or cool-season,<strong> </strong>depending on the 
temperatures at which they<strong> </strong>thrive. Creeping bentgrass, 
Kentucky bluegrass,<strong> </strong>ryegrasses and the fescues are cool-season
<strong> </strong>turfgrasses. They are best adapted to air<strong> </strong>
temperatures from 60 to 75 degrees F. Warm-season<strong> </strong>turfgrasses, 
including bermudagrass,<strong> </strong>centipedegrass, St. Augustinegrass and 
<em>Zoysia,</em><strong> </strong>grow best at air temperatures from 80 to 95
<strong> </strong>degrees F. Warm season turfgrasses lose their<strong> 
</strong>color and are dormant during cold winter months.<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Water.</strong></p> 
<p>Water moves from the soil solution into roots. Once inside plants, water 
helps protect them from sudden changes in temperature. Roots contain the least 
amount of water, and stems the most. Nutrients and sugars move through plants 
in water. Actively growing turfgrasses often contain more than 75 percent water 
on a dry-weight basis and use from 1/10 to 3/10 inch of water each day. An 
estimated 1 to 3 percent of the total amount of water taken up by turfgrasses 
every day is required for growth and development. The rest moves through the 
plants to the atmosphere. Warm-season turfgrasses have a very efficient 
photosynthetic system compared to the cool-season turfgrasses. Cool-season 
turfgrasses need about three times more water than warm-season turfgrasses to 
produce equal amounts of shoot and root tissue.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Atmospheric carbon dioxide. </strong></p> 
<p>The atmosphere contains several very important gases including nitrogen 
(~78 percent), oxygen (~21 percent) and carbon dioxide (~0.03 percent). Some 
plants (legumes) capture and use nitrogen from the atmosphere. Animals take in 
oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Plants obtain carbon from atmospheric carbon 
dioxide. Carbon, a component of amino acids, proteins, sugars and starch, is 
also found in the walls of plant cells.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Nutrition.</strong></p> 
<p>In addition to carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), turfgrasses require 
at least 13 mineral nutrients for survival and seed production. Turfgrasses 
obtain the majority of each from the soil. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), 
potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulfur (S) are classified as 
macronutrients according to the amount of each used by turfgrasses. Of these, 
N, P and K are primary essential nutrients. Calcium, Mg and S are secondary 
essential nutrients. Note that although the required quantity varies among the 
six macronutrients, each is equally important. The amount of each primary 
nutrient found in turfgrass tissue, in descending order, is N &gt; K &gt; P. 
Seven other essential nutrients are required in minor amounts. Boron (B), 
chlorine (Cl), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc 
(Zn) are essential minor or micronutrients. Most recently, nickel and sodium 
have received attention as essential micronutrients.</p>

<h3>How low temperatures damage turf</h3> Saturday, December 24th, 2011 
<p>What happens to a warm-season grass when it is exposed to cold? It 
doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but the temperature can plummet, even in the most 
tropical of climes. When it drops below 20&deg;F, injury to turfgrass can 
occur. Winter injury can result from any one or a combination of four 
conditions: tissue desiccation, direct low temperature kill, diseases and 
traffic effects.</p> 
<p>Most warm-season grasses have very poor cold tolerance ratings and enter a 
state of dormancy or a reduction in growth and metabolism in the fall. This 
state is maintained throughout the winter and although brown, dead shoot tissue 
may be evident, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the grass will not recover. 
In fact, this natural state provides protection for the grass when exposed to 
cold temperatures.</p> 
<p>The turf&rsquo;s cold tolerance is also affected by the weather pattern 
preceding a severe frost. If the turf has been exposed to several frosts prior 
to a dramatic drop in temperature, it has been better conditioned to withstand 
extra cold temperatures. The frost conditions help to increase carbohydrates 
and proteins in the plants which enable the crown tissue to withstand a cold 
snap without severe membrane disruption.</p> 
<p>Poor drainage, excessive thatch, reduced lighting, excessive fall nitrogen 
fertilization and a close mowing height are all cultural practices which tend 
to promote cold injury.</p>

<h3>The Pros and Cons of Night Watering</h3> Thursday, July 14th, 2011 
<p>Some activities are best suited to the deep dark of night. Stargazing is 
one. Watching fireworks is another. Roasting marshmallows over a campfire is 
one. Watering your lawn is not!</p> 
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that watering your lawn is more cost effective when 
there is less water loss due to evaporation or wind, and those conditions are 
usually present at night, watering at night has its drawbacks:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You won&rsquo;t be as likely to notice problems with your irrigation 
system such as water runoff, poor sprinkler coverage or water breaks</li> 
<li>Grass stays wet longer at night and is more likely to become infected with 
disease (some diseases can develop in as little as two hours when a film of 
water remains on the grass!)</li> </ul> 
<p>So how to take advantage of the optimum conditions but avoid the potential 
pitfalls? Shut the water off 30 minutes before sundown to give the grass time 
to dry.</p>

<h3>Controlling Chinch Bugs Is Not a Cinch!</h3> Thursday, May 19th, 2011 
<p>It&rsquo;s not a cinch, but controlling chinch bugs in St. Augustine grass 
is possible with careful observation and deliberate steps.</p> 
<p>Expanding, irregular patches of dead or stunted grass surrounded by a halo 
of yellowing, dying grass often provide the first clue to the presence of 
chinch bugs. These islands of dying grass tend to increase in size and merge as 
insect numbers increase. Damage can develop rapidly, especially in sunny 
locations during hot, dry weather.</p> 
<p>Chinch bug damage can be confused with certain lawn diseases. For instance 
brown patch is a common disease affecting the leaf blades of St. 
Augustinegrass. Brown patch symptoms, however, usually occur in a circular or 
semi-circular pattern, whereas chinch bug feeding results in irregular-shaped 
areas of dead and dying grass. Chinch bug damage also can be difficult to 
distinguish from damage caused by drought.</p> 
<p>Reduce your exposure to chinch bugs with these best practices:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep thatch to a minimum with proper mowing. If necessary, employ the use 
of a vertical mower or aeration techniques if excessive thatch becomes a 
problem.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t feed the bugs! Over fertilization not only creates a 
delectable dining table for chinch bugs, but it contributes to thatch formation.
</li> 
<li>Water correctly. Chinch bugs prefer hot, dry environments. Too little 
watering produces this. On the other hand, over-watering creates an environment 
that cannot sustain the microbes needed to decompose thatch.</li> 
<li>Guard against stress caused by drought. Drought-stressed lawns are more 
susceptible to chinch bug infections.</li> 
<li>Choose a chinch bug resistant type of grass.</li> 
<li>Use chemical controls judiciously. Before resorting to chemical controls, 
be certain chinch bugs are the culprit. Inspect your lawn weekly looking for 
off-color areas, especially in direct sun, and along sidewalks and driveways. 
When chinch bugs are present in high enough numbers to cause grass to yellow, 
they can often be found by parting the grass at the edge of affected areas and 
examining the soil and base of the turf. Products containing diazinon, 
chlorpyrifos (Dursban&reg;), or acephate (Orthene&reg;) are suggested for 
homeowner applications. Where any of these products fail to provide control, 
apply a synthetic pyrethroid such as permethrin.</li> </ul>

<h3>5 Tips to Get Your Empire Zoysia Lawn Ready for Spring</h3> Tuesday, April 
26th, 2011 
<p>When you&rsquo;re seeking a thick blanket of deep green to make a striking 
appearance in your yard, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the superior performance and 
beauty of Empire Zoysia. Discovered in Brazil, amid the lush, tropical foliage, 
there&rsquo;s no wonder Empire thrives in hot and humid as well as desert 
areas. You might not expect turf grass this strong to also be soft, but Empire 
beckons you to take barefoot walks across its plush carpet of densely packed 
blades. Especially created for family outings and backyard picnics, Empire 
welcomes a variety of activities without taking extensive wear and tear.</p> 
<p>Tight blade growth also contributes to the depth of color found in Empire 
Zoysia. With its wide blades and luscious dark green hue that lasts through 
much of the winter, it&rsquo;s truly a turf grass that will greatly enhanced 
curb appeal for your home.</p> 
<p>It is one of the few grasses rated to perform well in all zones. As hardy 
as it is attractive, Empire has a deep, thick root structure, and is more 
drought tolerant than most varieties of Zoysia once established. In addition, 
slow growth plus natural chinch bug and chemical resistance means your lawn 
will require less maintenance, mowing, and watering than with other types of 
warm season grass.</p> 
<p>How to get your Empire Zoysia lawn ready for spring? Follow these five 
steps:</p> 
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> &ndash; MOW LOW!&nbsp; For the first mowing of the 
year, scalp the lawn with the mower and bag the clippings.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> &ndash; Apply fertilizer at a recommended 1-0-1 
ratio.&nbsp; For example 15-0-15.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> &ndash; Apply pre-emergent herbicide to prevent 
summer weeds.&nbsp; You can buy it already mixed in with fertilizer.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> &ndash; To prevent Billbugs and other insect pests, 
put down a broad spectrum insecticide containing bifenthrin.&nbsp; Make sure to 
water any granular insecticides into the lawn.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> &ndash; Empire turf needs about 3/4 of an inch of 
water per week from either natural rainfall or in-ground irrigation.&nbsp; 
Overwatering can lead to fungus outbreaks.&nbsp; If needed, put down a systemic 
fungicide with an active ingredient.</p>

<h3>Once on the Move, Armyworm Hard to Control</h3> Thursday, August 12th, 2010
<p>Like its namesake military force, Armyworms can strike anywhere and become 
harder to control the larger they grow, however its name is derived from its 
feeding habits. Armyworms will eat everything in an area and once the food 
supply is exhausted the entire &ldquo;army&rdquo; will move to the next 
available food source, feeding and moving stealthily during the night, 
hunkering down beneath fallen debris during the day.</p> 
<p>The Armyworm is actually the caterpillar life stage of a moth, and grows to 
about 1&frac12;&rdquo; long. Pale green when first hatched, they change to 
olive green with a white stripe later on in the season, eventually morphing 
into brown moths sporting a white spot on each wing.</p> 
<p>The Armyworm causes damage similar to that of sodworms, but it is more 
scattered and not confined to patches. The damage usually moves in from the 
edges and often proceeds in a relatively straight line as the Armyworms march 
across the lawn.</p> 
<p>Preventive and organic control measures include</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Raking up fallen debris to eliminate daytime hiding places</li> 
<li>Encouraging birds to visit by setting out feeders, birdbaths or nesting 
material in the area where the worms are feeding</li> 
<li>Attracting predatory wasps to control the Armyworms by planting dill, 
fennel, coreopsis and brightly colored flowers near the feeding areas</li> 
<li>Spraying Bacillus thuringiensis, an organic control for caterpillars, in 
the late afternoon or early evening hours when you see the first signs of 
armyworm damage in your garden. Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is actually a 
bacteria and is safe to use around children and pets. There are also numerous 
chemical sprays available to control armyworms.</li> </ul> 
<p>Many turfgrass managers use pyrethroids for Armyworm control.</p> 
<p>Because they are most active in the fall, it is time to set up your 
reconnaissance mission now, becoming familiar with the health of your lawn or 
garden. If these measures are not sufficient to control the advancing army, 
enlist the aid of a professional pest control company.</p>

<h3>Much Ado About Mulch</h3> Thursday, July 15th, 2010 
<p>Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use 
in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread 
on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic &mdash; such as grass 
clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials &mdash; or inorganic 
&mdash; such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic 
mulches have numerous benefits.</p> 
<p><strong>Mulch</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Protects the soil from erosion</li> 
<li>Reduces compaction from the impact of heavy rains</li> 
<li>Conserves moisture, reducing the need for frequent waterings</li> 
<li>Maintains a more even soil temperature</li> 
<li>Prevents weed growth</li> 
<li>Keeps fruits and vegetables clean</li> 
<li>Keeps feet clean, allowing access to garden even when damp</li> 
<li>Provides a &ldquo;finished&rdquo; look to the garden</li> </ul> 
<p>Organic mulches also improve the condition of the soil. As these mulches 
slowly decompose, they provide organic matter which helps keep the soil loose. 
This improves root growth, increases the infiltration of water, and also 
improves the water-holding capacity of the soil. Organic matter is a source of 
plant nutrients and provides an ideal environment for earthworms and other 
beneficial soil organisms.</p> 
<p>While inorganic mulches have their place in certain landscapes, they lack 
the soil improving properties of organic mulches. Inorganic mulches, because of 
their permanence, may be difficult to remove if you decide to change your 
garden plans at a later date. Therefore, this tip sheet is limited to the use 
of organic mulches.</p> 
<p><strong>Mulch Materials</strong></p> 
<p>You can find mulch materials in your own yard! Lawn clippings make 
excellent mulch. While not particularly attractive for a flower bed, they work 
wonderfully in the vegetable garden. The fine texture allows them to be spread 
easily even around small plants. However, grass clippings are becoming scarce 
because of the increased popularity of mulching lawnmowers that provide many of 
the same benefits of mulching to lawns. Newspaper, as a mulch, works especially 
well to control weeds. Leaves are another readily available material to use as 
mulch. Leaf mold, or the decomposed remains of leaves, gives the forest floor 
its absorbent spongy structure. Compost makes a wonderful mulch if you have a 
large supply. Compost not only improves the soil structure but provides an 
excellent source of plant nutrients.</p> 
<p>Bark chips and composted bark mulch are available at garden centers. These 
make a neat finish to the garden bed and will eventually improve the condition 
of the soil. These may last for one to three years or more depending on the 
size of the chips or how well composed the bark mulch is. Smaller chips tend to 
be easier to spread, especially around small plants. Depending on where you 
live, numerous other materials make excellent mulches. Hay and straw work well 
in the vegetable garden, although they may harbor weed seeds. Seaweed mulch, 
ground corn cobs, and pine needles can also be used. Pine needles tend to 
increase the acidity of the soil so they work best around acid-loving plants 
such as rhododendrons and blueberries.</p> 
<p><strong>When to Apply Mulch</strong></p> 
<p>Time of application depends on what you hope to achieve by mulching. 
Mulches, by providing an insulating barrier between the soil and the air, 
moderate the soil temperature. This means that a mulched soil in the summer 
will be cooler than an adjacent unmulched soil; while in the winter, the 
mulched soil may not freeze as deeply. However, since mulch acts as an 
insulating layer, mulched soils tend to warm up more slowly in the spring and 
cool down more slowly in the fall than unmulched soils.</p> 
<p>If you are using mulches in your vegetable garden or flower garden, it is 
best to apply them after the soil has warmed up in the spring. Cool, wet soils 
tend to slow seed germination and increase the decay of seeds and seedlings.</p>
<p>If adding additional layers of mulch to existing perennial beds, wait until 
the soil has warmed completely.</p> 
<p>Mulches used to help moderate winter temperatures can be applied late in 
the fall after the ground has frozen but before the coldest temperatures 
arrive. Applying mulches before the ground has frozen may attract rodents 
looking for a warm over-wintering site. Delayed applications of mulch should 
prevent this problem as, hopefully, the creatures would already have found some 
other place to nest!</p> 
<p>Mulches used to protect plants over winter should be loose material such as 
straw, hay, or pine boughs that will help insulate the plants without 
compacting under the weight of snow and ice. One of the benefits from winter 
applications of mulch is the reduction in the freezing and thawing of the soil 
in the late winter and early spring. These repeated cycles of freezing at night 
and then thawing in the warmth of the sun cause many small or shallow rooted 
plants to be heaved out of the soil. This leaves their root systems exposed and 
results in injury or death. Mulching helps prevent the rapid fluctuations in 
soil temperature and reduces the chances of heaving.</p> 
<p><strong>Applying Mulch</strong></p> 
<p>Begin by asking yourself the following questions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>What do I hope to achieve by mulching? Weed control? Moisture retention? 
Soil improvement? Beautification?</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>How large is the area to be mulched?</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>How much mulch will I need to cover the area? Mulch is measured in cubic 
feet. As an example, if you have an area 10 feet by 10 feet and you wish to 
apply 3 inches of mulch, you would need 25 cubic feet.</li> </ul> 
<p>Determine what mulch material to use and purchase or accumulate what you 
need. Mulch can often be purchased bagged or bulk from garden centers. Bulk may 
be cheaper if you need large volumes and have a way to haul it. Bagged mulch is 
often easier to handle, especially for smaller projects. Most bagged mulch 
comes in 3-cubic-feet bags.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Compost &mdash; refer to the tip sheet on composting for information on 
how to make your own compost.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Leaves</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>Collect leaves in the fall.</li> 
<li>Chop with a lawnmower or shredder. Whole leaves tend to compact if wet or 
blow away if dry. Chopping will reduce the volume and facilitate composting.
</li> 
<li>Compost leaves over winter. Some studies have indicated that freshly 
chopped leaves may inhibit the growth of certain crops. Therefore, it may be 
advisable to compost the leaves over winter before spreading them.</li> </ol> 
<ul> 
<li>Grass clippings &mdash; spread them immediately to avoid heating and 
rotting.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Newspaper</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>Save your own newspapers.</li> 
<li>Only use newspaper text pages (black ink); color dyes may be harmful to 
soil microflora and fauna if composted and used.</li> 
<li>Use 3 or 4 sheets together, anchored with grass clippings or other mulch 
material to prevent blowing away.</li> </ol> 
<p>The amount of mulch to apply will be determined by the mulch material you 
are using.</p> 
<p><strong>General Guidelines</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not apply mulch directly in contact with plants. Leave an inch or so of 
space next to plants to help prevent diseases flourishing from excessive 
humidity.</li> 
<li>Remove weeds before spreading mulch.</li> </ul> Mulch Materials <br>

<strong>Material</strong> <strong>Amount to Apply</strong> <strong>Notes
</strong> <br>
Bark mulch 2-4 inches Smaller chips are easier to spread, 
especially around small plants. Excellent for use around trees, shrubs, and 
perennial gardens. When spreading mulch around trees, keep the mulch an inch or 
two away from the trunk. A couple inches of mulch is adequate.
<p></p> 
<p>There is no need to apply the mulch 6 or 8 inches high, as often is seen.
</p> <br>
Wood chips 2-4 inches Similar to bark mulch. If using fresh wood 
chips that are mixed with a lot of leaves, composting may be beneficial. <br>

Leaves 3-4 inches Best to chop and compost before spreading. If using dry 
leaves, apply about 6 inches. <br>
Grass clippings 2-3 inches Thicker layers 
tend to compact and rot, becoming quite slimy and smelly. Add additional layers 
as clippings decompose. Do not use clippings from lawns treated with herbicides.
<br> Newspaper 1/4 inch Apply sheets of newspaper and cover lightly with grass 
clippings or other mulch material to anchor. If other mulch materials are not 
available, cover edges of paper with soil. Applying on a windy day can be a 
problem. <br>
Compost 3-4 inches Excellent material for enriching soil. <br>

<br> 
<p>Bark mulch and wood chips are sometimes used with landscape fabric or 
plastic. The fabric or plastic is laid on top of the soil and then covered with 
a layer of bark chips. A caution to this practice: while initially the plastic 
or fabric may provide additional protection against weeds, as the mulch breaks 
down, weeds will start to grow in the mulch itself. The barrier between the 
soil and the mulch also prevents any improvement in the soil condition and 
makes planting additional plants more difficult.</p> 
<p><strong>For Sources of Mulch</strong></p> 
<p>Check under mulches or garden centers or nurseries in the Yellow Pages. 
Your community may also have wood chips from the removal of street trees that 
are available free to residents.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s Your Lawn Doing for You?</h3> Monday, July 5th, 2010 
<p>Do you dread summer lawncare? Does the thought of spending hours out in the 
hot sun mowing, weeding, fertilizing and watering leave you less than 
enthusiastic about your yard? To better appreciate the work your turfgrass is 
doing for you, consider these facts from the Professional Lawn Care Association 
of America:</p> 
<p>The front lawns of 8 average size houses have the cooking effect as about 
70 tons of air conditioning, while the average home-size central air unit has 
only a 3- to 4-ton capacity.</p> 
<p>Turfgrasses trap much of an estimated 12 million tons of dust and dirt 
released annually into the U.S. atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Turfgrasses help purify water entering underground aquifers by its root 
mass and soil microbes acting as a filter to capture and break down many types 
of pollutants.</p> 
<p>A turf area of just 50 feet square absorbs carbon dioxide, ozone, hydrogen 
fluoride and perosyacetyle nitrate and will release enough oxygen to meet the 
needs of a family of four.</p> 
<p>So your little patch of paradise is cooling, cleaning and purifying your 
environment. And really, what beats the smell of a new-mown lawn on a sultry 
summer day?</p>

<h3>Is your lawn contributing to global warming? Not according to new research!
</h3> Thursday, March 18th, 2010 
<p>Misconceptions can spread on the Internet like dollar weed spreads through 
a lawn! In its newsletter for March, theFlorida Turfgrass Association alerted 
members to an article published on January 22, 2010 in<em>Geophysical Research 
Letters</em> by researchers at the University of California, Irvine. The 
article was about carbon sequestration in turfgrass and the amount of carbon 
resulting from the care and maintenance of turf. Carbon sequestration is a 
geoengineering technique for the long-term storage of carbon dioxide or other 
forms of carbon, for the mitigation of global warming. The article reported 
conclusions that were fundamentally the opposite of previous research findings.
</p> 
<p>The FTGA explained the Californians&rsquo; research process and their 
conclusion, &ldquo;Focusing on four parks in the Irvine area, the study found 
that greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer production, mowing, leaf blowing 
and other lawn management practices were four times greater than the amount of 
carbon stored by grass in parks and lawns.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Media attention to these findings was extensive, but<em><strong> </strong>
</em><em>the study contained errors and miscalculations. The FTGA reported that 
</em>&ldquo;Dr. Thomas Rufty and two graduate students at North Carolina State 
University took apart all of the assumptions and calculations in the research 
report and found mistakes. Their corrected calculations showed that CO2 
generation was 122 g m-2 yr-1 rather than 1238 g m-2 yr-1, a miscalculation of 
10X in the original paper.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The authors of the original article have acknowledged that the new data is 
the correct data, according to the FTGA. &ldquo;Unfortunately the corrected 
data has not generated any media interest. The fact that turfgrass has a 
positive impact on the environment when it comes to carbon sequestration is not 
new, hence it is not newsworthy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Growing a reputation is just like growing turfgrass &ndash; you have to be 
vigilant about eradicating the weeds! Many thanks to the FTGA for keeping 
watch. Now, go out and enjoy your lawn, knowing you have a positive impact on 
the environment!</p>
