<h2> Fusion </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>Fusion is not likely to work out, yet it is the only possible energy source 
that could replace fossil fuels (Science).</p> 
<p>Time was wasted over where to site the ITER fusion project, and if all goes 
well with construction, it won&rsquo;t be built until 2014. Then another twenty 
years of research are required, with no guarantee of a successful fusion model 
to build a power plant with in the end. Many physicists wish that other 
approaches to developing fusion had been taken, they don&rsquo;t believe that 
ITER is likely to work out.</p> 
<p>Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) puts it best: &ldquo;&hellip;hoping to 
solve our energy problems with fusion is a bit like you or me hoping to solve 
our personal financial problems by winning the lottery. That would be real 
nice. I think the odds are somewhere near the same. I am about as likely to win 
the lottery as we are to come to economically feasible fusion.&rdquo; </p> 
<p>Bartlett&rsquo;s full speech to congress: 
http://www.energybulletin.net/4733.html</p> 
<p>Richard Wolfson, in &ldquo;Nuclear Choices: A Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to 
Nuclear Technology&rdquo; has this problem with fusion: &ldquo;But in the long 
run, fusion itself could bring on the ultimate climactic crisis. The energy 
released in fusion would not otherwise be available on Earth; it would 
represent a new input to the global energy flow. Like all the rest of the 
global energy, fusion energy would ultimately become heat that Earth would have 
to radiate into space. As long as humanity kept its energy consumption a tiny 
fraction of the global energy flow, there would be no major problem. But 
history shows that human energy consumption grows rapidly when it is not 
limited by shortages of fuel. Fusion fuel would be unlimited, so our species 
might expand its energy consumption to the point where the output of our fusion 
reactors became significant relative to the global input of solar energy. At 
that point Earth&rsquo;s temperature would inevitably rise. This long-term 
criticism of fusion holds for any energy source that could add to Earth&rsquo;s 
energy flow even a few percent of what the Sun provides. Only solar energy 
itself escapes this criticism&rdquo;. page 274</p> 
<p>Unlimited energy would lead to unlimited human population growth which 
already is leading to depletion of many other things besides fossil fuels, such 
as water, topsoil, fisheries, forests, etc. In fact, fossil fuel depletion may 
not be the tipping point of ecological disaster &ndash; the burning of it has 
changed the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans, which could bring on sudden 
climate change and extreme weather: another ice age, droughts and floods, 
powerful hurricanes and storms &ndash; perhaps even another Permian-level 
extinction, with 90% of species vanishing (including us). The past 10,000 years 
have had the most stable weather in the past 250,000 years, which allowed 
agriculture to be invented, the foundation of any civilization above the 
hunter-gatherer level.</p> <br>

<h2> Wind power will not save us </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic
<br> <br>

<p><strong>SCALE.&nbsp; Too many windmills need to be built to replace oil.
</strong></p> 
<p>Worldwide, 32,850 wind turbines with 70 to 100 meter blades generating 1.65 
MW built every year for the next 50 years, or 1,642,000 total would be needed 
to replace the oil we burn in one year at a cost of 3.3 trillion dollars over 
4,000 square miles (Cubic mile of oil).</p> 
<p>The DOE estimates 18,000 square miles of good wind sites in the USA, which 
could produce 20% of America&rsquo;s electricity in total.&nbsp; this would 
require over 140,000 1.5 MW towers costing at least $300 billion dollars, and 
innumerable natural gas peaking plants to balance the load when the wind 
isn&rsquo;t blowing.&nbsp; Despite all the happy fracking, natural gas is a 
limited resource, and as it is substituted for coal more and more, roughly 
around 2018 to 2025 (depending on the economy, how many natural gas burning 
trucks and cars are created, etc), the fracking boom will end rather abruptly 
in many areas, and the price of natural gas will skyrocket.</p> 
<p>Or consider just the wind power needed to replace offshore oil in the Gulf 
of Mexico:</p> 
<p>At 5.8 MBtu heat value in a barrel of oil and 3412 BTU in a kWh, 1.7 
million barrels per day of gulf oil equals 2.9 billion kWh per day, or 1,059 
billion kWh a year. Yet the total2008 wind generation in Texas was 14.23 
billion kWh, and 5.42 billion kWh in California. Which means you&rsquo;d need 
195 California&rsquo;s, or 74 Texas&rsquo;s of wind, and 20 years to build it 
(Nelder).</p> 
<p><strong>Windmills are useless without the Grid, electric engines, storage 
of energy, and other infrastructure</strong></p> 
<p>Just as oil doesn&rsquo;t do much useful work when not burned within a 
combustion engine, wind needs a vast, interconnected grid.&nbsp; The larger the 
grid, the more wind that can be added to it.&nbsp; But we don&rsquo;t have that 
infrastructure &mdash; indeed, what we do have now is falling apart due to 
deregulation of utilities, with no monetary rewards for any player to maintain 
or upgrade the grid.</p> 
<p>Most of the really good, strong wind areas are so far from cities that 
it&rsquo;s useless because the energy to build a grid extending to these 
regions would use more energy than the wind would provide.</p> 
<p>Sure, oil and natural gas require pipelines too, but they&rsquo;re already 
in place, built back when the EROEI of oil was 100:1 &mdash; though</p> 
<p><strong>Windmills are too dependent on oil, from mining and fabrication to 
delivery and maintenance and fail the test of &ldquo;can they reproduce 
themselves with wind power?&rdquo;<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Oil-based combustion engines are used from start to finish mining material 
to make the windmill, fabrication of the windmill, delivering windmill 
components to the installation site, making the enormous amount of concrete and 
delivering it to where the windmill will be embedded, trenching machines and 
other equipment to connect windmills to the grid, maintenance vehicles run on 
oil, giant road-grading equipment and other oil-based vehicles to build and 
maintain concrete, asphalt, and dirt roads to windmills and the electric grid, 
the oil-based cars of windmill employees, and the entire supply chain to 
deliver over 7,000 windmill components from world-wide parts manufacturers via 
trucks, trains, and ships.&nbsp; Because wind and solar are intermittent, 
natural gas peaking plants must be built and fire up quickly when the wind dies 
down or the sun isn&rsquo;t shining.</p> 
<p>As Nate Hagens, former editor of theoildrum has said, wind turbines are 
fossil fuel extenders, using huge material and human resources.&nbsp; Building 
more stuff, when we are about to have less stuff, just digs the hole deeper.</p>
<p>Not only would windmills have to generate enough power to reproduce 
themselves, but they have to make enough power to run civilization.&nbsp; And 
how are they going to reproduce themselves? Think of the energy to make the 
cement and steel of a 300 foot tower with three 150 foot rotor blades sweeping 
an acre of air at 100 miles per hour.&nbsp; The turbine housing alone weighs 
over 56 tons, the blad assembly 36 tons, and the whole tower assembly is over 
163 tons.&nbsp; Florida Power &amp; Light says a typical turbine site is 42 by 
42 foot area with a 30 foot hole filled with tons of steel rebar-reinforced 
concrete &ndash;about 1,250 tons to hold the 300 foot tower in place 
(Rosenbloom).</p> 
<p><strong>Not enough time to scale wind up</strong></p> 
<p>Like solar, wind accounts for only a tiny fraction of renewable energy 
consumption in the United States, about a tenth of one percent, and will be 
hard to scale up in the short time left. EIA. June 2006.Renewable Energy Annual.
</p> 
<p><strong>Not enough materials to scale wind up</strong></p> 
<p>To build 3 TW of wind power you&rsquo;d need double the world&rsquo;s 
current steel production, half the world&rsquo;s copper production, 30 times 
the world&rsquo;s fiber glass production, and almost half of the world&rsquo;s 
coal (Prieto).</p> 
<p><strong>Most of wind will never be captured</strong></p> 
<p>Windmills can only capture a fraction of the wind blowing &mdash; not 
enough or too much and the windmill shuts down.</p> 
<p>Most of the really good wind is in remote locations far from the grid, and 
can&rsquo;t be connected.</p> 
<p>Much of the time, over an entire region, there is no wind blowing at all, a 
huge problem for balancing the electricity on the grid, which has to be kept 
within a narrow range (about 10% of the electricity on the grid is never 
delivered to a customer, it&rsquo;s there to balance the flow so that surges 
don&rsquo;t cause blackouts leading to the loss of power for millions of 
people).</p> 
<p>Globally we use about 12 terawatts of energy a year. There&rsquo;s 85 
terawatts of wind, but most of it is over the deep ocean, which we are unlikely 
to ever capture.&nbsp; A giant windmill perched on a giant boat has already 
used more energy than it will ever generate before this vast amount of energy 
intensive steel and other material rusts or sinks in a storm. let alone the 
cost and energy of running long cables from the ship to land and the electric 
grid.</p> 
<p>The maximum extractable energy from high jet stream wind is 200 times less 
than reported previously, and trying to extract them would profoundly impact 
the entire climate system of the planet.&nbsp; If we tried to extract the 
maximum possible 7.5 TW from the jet stream, &ldquo;the atmosphere would 
generate 40 times less wind energy than what we would gain from the wind 
turbines, resulting in drastic changes in temperature and weather&rdquo; 
according to Lee Miller, the author of the study (Miller).</p> 
<p>Carlos De Castro, a professor of Applied Physics, estimates that at most 
1Terawatt is the upper limit of the electrical potential of wind energy. This 
value is much lower than previous estimates (De Castro).</p> 
<p>Betz&rsquo;s law means you can never harvest more than 59% of the wind, no 
matter how well you build a windmill.</p> 
<p>And another huge part of the wind is above the windmills on land.&nbsp; So 
you can really only capture a very small part of the wind that&rsquo;s blowing.
</p> 
<p>You also have to space the windmills far apart, because on the other side 
of a windmill that has just &ldquo;captured&rdquo; wind, there&rsquo;s no wind 
left (Hayden).</p> 
<p>For example, if the best possible wind strip along the coast between San 
Francisco and LA were covered with the maximum possible number of windmills (an 
area about 300 miles long by one mile deep) you&rsquo;d get enough wind, when 
it was blowing, to replace only one of the dozens of power plants in California 
(Hayden).</p> 
<p>A wind farm takes up 30 to 200 times the space of a gas plant (Paul Gipe, 
Wind Energy Comes of Age, p. 396). A 50 megawatt wind farm can take up anywhere 
from two to twenty-five square miles (Proceedings of National Avian-Wind Power 
Planning Meeting, p. 11).</p> 
<p><strong>Wind is only strong enough to justify windmills in a few regions
</strong></p> 
<p>The wind needs to be at least force level 4 (13-18 mph) for as much of the 
year as possible to make it economically possible. This means that a great deal 
of land is not practical for the purpose.&nbsp; The land that is most suitable 
already has windmills, or is too far from the grid to be connected.</p> 
<p>A Class 3 windmill farm needs double the number of generators to produce 
the same amount of energy as windmills in a class 6 field (Prieto).</p> 
<p>The 1997 US EIA/DOE study (2002) came to the remarkable conclusion that 
&ldquo;&hellip;many non-technical wind cost adjustment factors &hellip; result 
in economically viable wind power sites on only 1% of the area which is 
otherwise technically available&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>The electric grid needs to be <em>much</em> larger than it is now 
to make wind feasible</strong></p> 
<p>Without a vastly expanded grid to balance the unpredictability of wind over 
a large area, wind can&rsquo;t provide a significant portion of electrical 
generation.&nbsp; But expanding the grid to the proper size would not only cost 
trillions of dollars and years we don&rsquo;t have, now that we&rsquo;re at 
peak, we&rsquo;d have to ruin many national parks, wilderness areas, and other 
natural areas to install them.</p> 
<p>And then, after the oil was gone, and there was no way to replace or 
maintain windmills, they&rsquo;d sit there, our version of Easter Island heads, 
of absolutely no use to future generations, not even for hanging laundry.</p> 
<p>Much of the land in the USA (the areas where there&rsquo;s lots of wind) is 
quite far from population centers. And when you hook windmills to the grid, you 
lose quite a bit of energy over transmission lines, especially since most of 
the wind is far from cities.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also takes a lot of energy to build 
and maintain the electric grid infrastructure itself. Remote wind sites often 
result in construction of additional transmission lines, estimated to cost as 
much as $300,000-$1 million per mile. (Energy Choices in a Competitive Era, 
Center for Energy and Economic Development Study, 1995 Study, p. 14). The 
economics of transmission are poor because while the line must be sized at peak 
output, wind&rsquo;s low capacity factor ensures significant under-utilization.
</p> 
<p><strong>Wind blows the strongest when customer demand is the weakest
</strong></p> 
<p>In Denmark, where some of the world&rsquo;s largest wind farms exist, wind 
blows the hardest when consumer demand is the lowest, so Denmark ends up 
selling its extra electricity to other countries for pennies, and then when 
demand is up, buys electricity back at much higher prices.&nbsp; 
Denmark&rsquo;s citizens pay some of the highest electricity rates on earth 
(Castelvecchi).</p> 
<p>In Texas and California, wind and solar are too erratic to provide more 
than 20% of a regions total energy capacity because it&rsquo;s too difficult to 
balance supply and demand beyond that amount.</p> 
<p>Wind varies greatly depending on the weather. Often it hardly blows at all 
during some seasons.&nbsp; In California, we need electricity the most in 
summer when peak loads are reached, but that&rsquo;s the season the least wind 
blows.&nbsp; On our hottest days, wind capacity factors drop to as low as .02 
at peak electric demand. At a time when the system most needs reliable base 
load capacity, wind base capacity is unavailable.</p> 
<p><strong>Wind is unreliable, requiring expensive natural gas peaking plants 
(rarely included in EROEI of wind and solar)</strong></p> 
<p>The first chart is the &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; of wind unreliability, 
measured at one of California&rsquo;s largest wind farms. The second is from 
the California Independent System Operator, showing how wind power tends to be 
low when power demand is high (and vice-versa). Wind should play an important 
role, but unless there is a high-voltage, high-capacity, high-density grid to 
accompany it (as in Northern Europe), or electricity storage, the variability 
of wind means that co-located natural gas peaking plants are needed as well.
<strong>The cost of such natural gas plants are rarely factored into the all-in 
costs of wind</strong> (Cembalest).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Wind surges, dies, stops, starts, so it has to be modulated in order to be 
usable by power companies, and ultimately, homes and businesses. This 
modulation means that the power grid can only use a maximum of 10% of its power 
from wind, or the network becomes too unstable and uncontrollable. Because of 
this problem,&nbsp; windmills are built to capture wind only at certain speeds, 
so when the wind is light or too strong, power is not generated.</p> 
<p>For example, in 1994, California wind power operated at only 23 percent 
realized average capacity in 1994 (California Energy Commission, Wind Project 
Performance: 1994).</p> 
<p><strong>No way to store wind energy</strong></p> 
<p>We don&rsquo;t have EROEI-positive batteries, compressed air, or enough 
pumped water dams to store wind energy and concentrate it enough to do useful 
work and generate power when the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing.&nbsp; There are no 
storage methods that can return the same amount of energy put into them, so 
having to store energy reduces the amount of energy returned.&nbsp; Compressed 
air storage is inefficient because &ldquo;air heats up when it is compressed 
and gets cold when it is allowed to expand.&nbsp; That means some of the energy 
that goes into compression is lost as waste heat.&nbsp; And if the air is 
simply let out, it can get so cold that it freezes everything it touches, 
including industrial-strength turbines.&nbsp; PowerSouth and E.ON burn natural 
gas to create a hot gas stream that warms the cold air as it expands into the 
turbines, reducing overall energy efficiency and releasing carbon dioxide, 
which undermines some of the benefits of wind power&rdquo; (Castelvecchi).</p> 
<p><strong>Wind Power surges harm industrial customers</strong></p> 
<p>Japan&rsquo;s biggest wind power supplier, may scrap a plan to build 
turbines on the northern island of Hokkaido after the regional utility cut 
proposed electricity purchases, blaming unreliable supply. Power surges can be 
a problem for industrial customers, said Hirotaka Hayashi, a spokesman at 
Hokkaido Electric. Utilities often need to cut back power generation at other 
plants to lessen the effect of excess power from wind energy.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Continental European countries such as Germany and Denmark can 
transfer excess power from windmills to other countries,&rdquo; said Arakawa. 
&ldquo;The electricity networks of Japan&rsquo;s 10 utilities aren&rsquo;t 
connected like those in Europe. That&rsquo;s the reason why it&rsquo;s 
difficult to install windmills in Japan.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>To ensure steady supply, Tohoku Electric Power Co., Japan&rsquo;s 
fourth-biggest generator, in March started requiring owners of new windmills to 
store energy in batteries before distribution rather than send the electricity 
direct to the utility, said spokesman Satoshi Arakawa. That requirement has 
increased wind project installation costs to 300,000 yen ($2,560) per kilowatt, 
from 200,000 yen, according to Toshiro Ito, vice president of EcoPower Co., 
Japan&rsquo;s third-biggest wind power supplier (Takemoto).</p> 
<p><strong>Energy returned on Energy Invested probably negative</strong></p> 
<p>Wind farms require vast amounts of steel and concrete, which in terms of 
mining, fabrication, and transportation to the site represent a huge amount of 
fossil fuel energy. The Zond 40-45 megawatt wind farm is composed of 150 wind 
turbines weighing 35 tons each &mdash; over 10 million pounds.</p> 
<p>The 5,700 turbines installed in the United States in 2009 used 36,000 miles 
of steel rebar and 1.7 million cubic yards of concrete (enough to pave a 
four-foot-wide, 7,630-mile-long sidewalk). The gearbox of a 2-megawatt wind 
turbine has 800 pounds of neodymium and 130 pounds of dysprosium &mdash;rare 
earth metals that are found in low-grade hard-to-find deposits that are very 
expensive to make. (American Wind Energy Association).</p> 
<p>Materials like carbon fiber that would make them more efficient cost&nbsp; 
several times more and use up a great deal more fossil fuel energy to fabricate 
than a fiber glass blade.</p> 
<p>From the mining of the metals to make windmills, to their fabrication, 
delivery, operation, to their Maintenance is very dependent upon fossil fuel 
energy and fossil fuel driven machinery. Wind energy at best could increase the 
amount of energy generated while fossil fuels last, but is too dependent on 
them to outlast the oil age.</p> 
<p>After a few years, maintenance costs skyrocket.&nbsp; The larger the 
windmill, the more complex maintenance is needed, yet the larger the windmill, 
the more wind can be captured.</p> 
<p><strong>Offshore Wind Farms likely to be destroyed by Hurricanes</strong>
</p> 
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that <strong>if the United 
States is to generate 20% of its electricity from wind, over 50 GW will be 
required from shallow offshore turbines</strong>. <strong>Hurricanes are a 
potential risk to these turbines</strong>. Turbine tower buckling has been 
observed in typhoons, but no offshore wind turbines have yet been built in the 
United States.&nbsp; I<strong>n the most vulnerable areas now being actively 
considered by developers, nearly half the turbines in a farm are likely to be 
destroyed in a 20-year period.</strong>&nbsp; (Rose).</p> 
<p>Source: Rose, S. 2 June 2011. Quantifying the Hurricane Risk to Offshore 
Wind Turbines.&nbsp; Carnegie Mellon University.</p> 
<p><strong>Offshore Windmills have other problems<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Offshore windmills are battered by waves and wind, and ice is also a huge 
problem.</p> 
<p>Offshore windmills need to exist in water that&rsquo;s 60 meters or less. 
15 meters or less is ideal economically as well as making the windmills less 
susceptible to large waves and wind damage.&nbsp; But many states along the 
west coast don&rsquo;t have shallow shelves where windmills can be built 
&mdash; California&rsquo;s best wind, by far, is offshore, but the water is far 
too deep for windmills, and the best wind is in the northern part of the state, 
too far away to be connected to the grid.</p> 
<p>Offshore windmills are a hazard to navigation of freighters and other ships.
</p> 
<p>The states that have by far the best wind resources and shallow depths 
offshore are North Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas, but they have 5 or more 
times the occurrence of hurricanes.</p> 
<p>As climate change leads to rising sea levels over the next thousand years, 
windmills will be rendered useless.</p> 
<p>Offshore windmills could conflict with other uses:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Ship navigation</li> 
<li>Aquaculture</li> 
<li>Fisheries and subsistence fishing</li> 
<li>Boating, scuba diving, and surfing</li> 
<li>Sand and gravel extraction</li> 
<li>Oil and gas infrastructure</li> 
<li>Compete with potential wave energy devices</li> </ol> 
<p>Offshore windparks will affect sediment transport, potentially clogging 
navigation channels, erosion, depositing of sediment on recreational areas, 
affect shoreline vegetation, scour sediments leading to loss of habitat for 
benthic communities, and damage existing seabed infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Building windmills offshore can lead to chemical contaminants, smothering, 
suspended sediments, turbidity, substratum loss, scouring, bird strikes, and 
noise.</p> 
<p>There is a potential for offshore wind farms to interfere with 
telecommunications, FAA radar systems, and marine communications (VHF [very 
high frequency] radio and radar).</p> 
<p>Land use changes.&nbsp; The windfarm offshore must be connected to the grid 
onshore, and there need to be roads to set up onshore substations and 
transmission lines.&nbsp; Plus industrial sites and ports to construct, 
operate, and decommission the windmillls.&nbsp; Roadways need to be potentially 
quite large to transport the enormous components of a windmill (Michel)</p> 
<p><strong>Operating and Maintenance costs too expensive</strong></p> 
<p>Offshore windmills will be subject to a tremendous amount of corrosion from 
the salt water and air.</p> 
<p>Wind mills are battered year round by hail storms, strong winds, blizzards, 
and temperature extremes from below freezing to hundred degree heat in summer. 
Corrosion increases over time.</p> 
<p>The same windmill can be beaten up variably, with the wind speed at the end 
of one blade considerably stronger than the wind at the tip of the other.&nbsp; 
This caused Suzlon blades to crack several years ago.</p> 
<p>A windmill is only as weak as it&rsquo;s weakest component, and the more 
components a windmill has, the more complex the maintenance. &nbsp;Wind 
turbines are complex machines. Each has around 7,000 or more components, 
according to Tom Maves, deputy director for manufacturing and supply chain at 
the American Wind Energy Association (Galbraith).</p> 
<p>Maintenance costs start to rise after 2 years (it&rsquo;s almost impossible 
to find out what these costs are from turbine makers). Vibration and corrosion 
damage the rotating blades, and the bearings, gear boxes, axles, and blades are 
subjected to high stresses.</p> 
<p>Gearboxes can be the Achilles&rsquo; heel, costing up to $500,000 to fix 
due to the high cost of replacement parts, cranes (which can cost 
$75,000-$100,000), post installation testing, re-commissioning and lost power 
production.</p> 
<p>If the electric grid were to be built up enough to balance the wind energy 
load better, the windmills breaking down in remote locations would require a 
huge amount of energy to keep trees cut back and remote roads built and kept up 
to deliver and maintain the turbine and grid infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Large scale wind farms need to &ldquo;overcome significant barriers&rdquo;: 
Costs overall are too high, and windmills in lower wind speed areas need to 
become more cost effective. Low wind speed areas are 20 times more common than 
high wind areas, and five times closer to the existing electrical distribution 
systems. Improvement is needed in integrating fluctuating wind power into the 
electrical grid with minimal impact on cost and reliability. Offshore wind 
facilities cost more to install, operate, and maintain than onshore windmills.

<p>Windmills wear out from ice storms, hitting insects, dust and sand abrade 
the blades and structure, and so on.</p> 
<p><strong>We Can&rsquo;t build large enough windmills</strong></p> 
<p>Useful energy increases with the square of the blade length, and 
there&rsquo;s more wind the higher up you go, so ideally you&rsquo;d build very 
tall wind towers with huge blades.&nbsp; But conventional materials can&rsquo;t 
handle these high wind conditions, and new, super-strong materials are too 
expensive.</p> 
<p>As towers get to be 100 meters high and more, and blade length increases, 
shipping them gets challenging. Trucks carrying big towers and blades must 
sometimes move with police escorts and avoid certain overpasses or small roads 
(Galbraith).</p> 
<p><strong>Investment takes too long, if ever to pay back</strong></p> 
<p>There isn&rsquo;t already a lot of wind power because investors 
aren&rsquo;t willing to wait 20 to 30 years to get their money back when they 
can invest it in oil and natural gas drilling and get most of their money back 
in a few years.</p> 
<p>Suckers who believe the wind proponent value of EROEI at 20:1 don&rsquo;t 
understand the factors left out, such as rare metals, natural gas peaking 
plants, grid infrastructure, maintenance costs, and so on.</p> 
<p><strong>Not In My Back Yard</strong></p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s been a great deal of NIMBYism preventing windmills from being 
built so far. Some of the objections are visual blight, bird killing, noise, 
and erosion from service roads.</p> 
<p>After 25 years of marriage, I still have to sometimes go downstairs to 
sleep when my husband snores too loudly, so I can imagine how annoying windmill 
noise might be.&nbsp; And even more so after someone sent me a document 
entitled &ldquo;Confidential issues report draft. Waubra &amp; Other Victorian 
Wind Farm Noise Impact Assessments&rdquo; that made the case that windmill 
noise affects the quality of life, disturbs sleep, and has adverse health 
effects. I especially liked the descriptions of possible noices: whooshes, 
rumble-thumps, whining, clunks, and swooshes.&nbsp; Low frequency sounds can 
penetrate walls and windows and cause vibrations and pressure changes.&nbsp; 
Many people affected would like to come up with a standard that windmill farms 
must be at least 2 kilometres away and not exceed a noise level of 35 dB(A) at 
any time outside neighboring dwellings.</p> 
<p><strong>Wind turbines depend on rare earth metals</strong></p> 
<p>Such as the neodymium used in turbine magnets.&nbsp; Neodymium prices 
quadrupled this year, and that&rsquo;s with wind still making up less than 3% 
of global electricity generation (Cembalest).</p> 
<p><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The environmental impact of mining the rare metals required for 
windmills makes their use questionable</strong>.&nbsp; Mongolia has large 
reserves of rare earth metals, especially neodymium, the element needed to make 
the magnets in wind turbines.&nbsp; Its extraction has led to a 5-mile wide 
poisonous tailings lake in northern China.&nbsp; Nearby farmland for miles is 
now unproductive, and one of China&rsquo;s key waterways is at risk. 
&ldquo;This vast, hissing cauldron of chemicals is the dumping ground for seven 
million tons a year of mined rare earth after it has been doused in acid and 
chemicals and processed through red-hot furnaces to extract its 
components.&nbsp; Rusting pipelines meander for miles from factories processing 
rare earths in Baotou out to the man-made lake where, mixed with water, the 
foul-smelling radioactive waste from this industrial process is pumped day 
after day&rdquo; (Parry).</p> 
<p><strong>Local and Global Weather are affected</strong></p> 
<p>Scientists modeled the impact of a hypothetical large-scale wind farm in 
the Great Plains. Their conclusion in The Journal of Geophysical Research, is 
that thousands of turbines concentrated in one area can affect local weather, 
by making warmer drier conditions from the atmospheric mixing in the blades 
wake.&nbsp; The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches 
the surface is a significant change, Dr. Baidya Roy said, and is similar to the 
kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large-scale deforestation 
(2Nov 2004.Catch the Wind, Change the Weather. New York Times.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that extracting wind energy on a 
global scale is going to have a noticeable effect. &hellip; There is really no 
such thing as a free lunch,&rdquo; said David Keith, a professor of energy and 
the environment at the University of Calgary and lead author of a report in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p> 
<p>Specifically, if wind generation were expanded to the point where it 
produced one-10th of today&rsquo;s energy, the models say cooling in the Arctic 
and a warming across the southern parts of North America should happen.</p> 
<p>The exact mechanism for this is unclear, but the scientists believe it may 
have to do with the disruption of the flow of heat from the equator to the 
poles.</p> 
<p><strong>Fisheries&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>The Sierra club in Maine is asking the Minerals Management Service&nbsp; to 
look at over a dozen aspects of wind offshore, including possible interference 
with known upwelling zones and/or important circulatory and current regimes 
that might influence the distribution or recruitment of marine species.</p> 
<p>Wind affects the upwelling of nutrients and may be a key factor in booms 
and busts of theCalifornia sardine fishery and other marine species.</p> 
<p><strong>Ocean bottom</strong></p> 
<p>Installing offshore windmills requires excavation of the seafloor to create 
a level surface, and sinking the 250 to 350 ton foundations into the seabed, 
which are very expensive to build,since they require scour protection from 
large stones, erosion control mats, and so on.</p> 
<p><strong>Potential Impacts to Currents and Tides</strong></p> 
<p>Wind turbine foundations can affect the flow velocity and direction and 
increase turbulence. These changes to currents can affect sediment transport, 
resulting in erosion or piles of sediments on nearby shorelines.&nbsp; Modified 
currents also could change the distribution of salinity, nutrients, effluents, 
river outflows, and thermal stratification, in turn affecting fish and benthic 
habitats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to major ocean currents such as the Gulf 
Stream could affect areas well beyond the continental United States, affecting 
the climate of North America as well as other continents (Michel).</p> 
<p><strong>Lack of a skilled and technical workforce</strong></p> 
<p>wind power officials see a much larger obstacle coming in the form of its 
own work force, a highly specialized group of technicians that combine working 
knowledge of mechanics, hydraulics, computers and meteorology with the 
willingness to climb 200 feet in the air in all kinds of weather (Twiddy).</p> 
<p><strong>Wind only produces electricity</strong></p> 
<p>We need liquid fuels for the immediate crisis at hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Wind has a low capacity Factor</strong></p> 
<p>In the very best windmill farms, the capacity factor is only 28 to 35%</p> 
<p><strong>Dead bugs and salt reduce wind power generation by 20 to 30%
</strong></p> 
<p>Over time the build-up of dead insects and/or salt on off-shor turbine 
blades reduces power by up to 30%.</p> 
<p><strong>Kite Windmills</strong></p> 
<p>There are several research groups looking at generating electricity using 
giant kites up in the jet stream. But it won&rsquo;t be easy.&nbsp; Jet streams 
move around and change their location, airplanes need to stay well away, and 
lightning and thunderstorms might require them to be brought down.</p> 
<p>The strongest wind is 6 miles above us, where winds are typically 60 miles 
per hour.&nbsp; Some scientists think there&rsquo;s enough wind to generate 100 
times current global energy demand.</p> 
<p>But Axel Kleidon and Lee Miller of the Max Planck Institute for 
Biogeochemistry believe that&rsquo;s a massive overestimate of the amount of 
energy that could be obtained. If they&rsquo;re right that jet stream wind 
results from a lack of friction, then at most 7.5 TW of power could be 
extracted, and that would have a major effect on climate (Earth System 
Dynamics, vol 2, p 201).</p> 
<p><strong>Wind Power Can&rsquo;t be scaled up</strong></p> 
<p>Denmark is often pointed out as a country that scaled wind up to provide 
20% of its power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet because wind is so intermitent, no 
conventional power plants have been shut down because they need to step in when 
the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing (enough).&nbsp; The quick ramping up and down of 
these power plants actually increases greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; And when 
the wind does blow enough, the power is surplus and most is sold to other 
countries at an extremely cheap price.&nbsp; And often they have to import 
electricity!&nbsp; The Danish pay the highest electricity prices in 
Europe.&nbsp; The actual capacity is 20%, not the 30% the BWEA and AWEA claim 
is possible (Rosenbloom).</p> 
<p><strong>Small windmills</strong></p> 
<p>According to the American Wind Energy Association, these are the challenges 
of small windmills: they&rsquo;re too expensive for most people, there&rsquo;s 
insufficient product reliability, lack of consumer protection from unscrupulous 
suppliers, most local jurisdictions limit the height of structures to 35 feet 
(wind towers must be at least 60 feet high and higher than objects around them 
like trees, etc), utilities make it hard and discourage people from connecting 
to the grid, the inverters that modify the wildly fluctuating wind voltages 
into 60-cycle AC are too expensive, and they&rsquo;re too noisy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blackwell, R. Oct 30, 2005. How much wind power is too much? Globe and Mail.
</p> 
<p>Wind power has become a key part of Canada&rsquo;s energy mix, with the 
number of installed wind turbines growing exponentially in recent months. But 
the fact the wind doesn&rsquo;t blow all the time is creating a potential 
roadblock that could stall growth in the industry.</p> 
<p>Alberta and Ontario, the two provinces with the most wind turbines up and 
whirling, face concerns that there are limits on how much power can be 
generated from the breeze before their electricity systems are destabilized.</p>
<p>Alberta recently put a temporary cap on wind generation at 900 megawatts 
&mdash; a level it could reach as early as next year &mdash; because of the 
uncertainty. And a report in Ontario released last week says that in some 
situations more than 5,000 MW of wind power, stable operation of the power grid 
could be jeopardized.</p> 
<p>Warren Frost, vice-president for operations and reliability at the Alberta 
Electric System Operator, said studies done over the past couple of years 
showed there can be problems when wind contributes more than about 10 per cent 
of the province&rsquo;s electricity &mdash; about 900 MW &mdash; because of the 
chance the wind could stop at any time.</p> 
<p>Each 100 MW of wind power is enough to supply a city about the size of 
Lethbridge, Alta.</p> 
<p>If the power &ldquo;disappears on you when the wind dies, then you&rsquo;ve 
got to make it up, either through importing from a neighbouring jurisdiction or 
by ramping up generators,&rdquo; Mr. Frost said.</p> 
<p>But Alberta is limited in its imports, because the provincial power grid 
has connections only with British Columbia and Saskatchewan. And hydroelectric 
plants with water reservoirs, which can turn on a dime to start producing 
power, are limited in the province. Coal-fired plants and most gas-fired plants 
take time to get up to speed, making them less useful as backups when the wind 
fails.</p> 
<p>There can also be a problem, Mr. Frost noted, when the wind picks up and 
generates more power than is being demanded &mdash; that potential imbalance 
also has to be accounted for.</p> 
<p>There are a number of ways to allow wind power to make up a greater 
proportion of the electricity supply, but they require more study, Mr. Frost 
said. First, he said, the province can develop more sophisticated ways of 
forecasting the wind so the power it generates is more predictable.</p> 
<p>The province could also build more plants that can quickly respond if the 
wind dies down during a peak period, for example. But building new gas-powered 
plants merely to help handle the variability of wind is certain to raise the 
ire of environmentalists.</p> 
<p>The province could also increase its connections to other jurisdictions, 
where it would buy surplus power when needed. Alberta is already looking at 
links with some northwestern U.S. states, including Montana.</p> 
<p>Over all, Alberta is committed to &ldquo;adding as much wind as 
feasible&rdquo; Mr. Frost said. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re balancing is the 
reliability [issue].</p> 
<p>Robert Hornung, president of the Canadian Wind Energy Association, which 
represents companies in the wind business, said he prefers to think of 
Alberta&rsquo;s 900 MW limit as a &ldquo;speed bump&rdquo; rather than a fixed 
cap.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We have every confidence they&rsquo;ll be able to go further than 
that,&rdquo; Mr. Hornung said, particularly if the industry and regulators put 
some effort into wind forecasting over the next year or so. That&rsquo;s 
crucial, he said, because &ldquo;we have projects of many, many more megawatts 
than 900 waiting to proceed in Alberta.</p> 
<p>In Ontario, the situation is less acute than in Alberta, but the wind study 
released last week &mdash; prepared for the industry and regulators &mdash; 
shows some similar concerns.</p> 
<p>While wind power could be handled by the Ontario grid up to 5,000 MW 
&mdash; about 320 MW of wind turbines are currently in operation with another 
960 MW in planning stages &mdash; the situation changes at higher levels, the 
study suggests.</p> 
<p>Particularly during low demand periods when wind makes up a relatively high 
proportion of the power mix, &ldquo;stable operation of the power system could 
be compromised&rdquo; if backup systems can&rsquo;t be ramped up quickly to 
deal with wind fluctuations, the report said.</p> 
<p>But Ontario is in a better position than Alberta because it has far more 
interconnections with other provinces and states, where it can buy or sell 
power.</p> 
<p>And it also has its wind turbines more geographically dispersed than 
Alberta, where most wind farms are in the south of the province. That means the 
chance of the wind failing everywhere at the same time is lower in Ontario.</p> 
<p>Don Tench, director of planning and assessments for Ontario&rsquo;s 
Independent Electricity System Operator, said he thinks better wind forecasting 
is the key to making the new source of power work effectively.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If we have a few hours notice of a significant wind change, we can 
make plans to deal with it,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>Mr. Frost, of the Alberta system operator, said European countries such as 
Denmark and Germany have been able to maintain a high proportion of wind power 
in their electricity systems mainly because they have multiple connections to 
other countries&rsquo; power grids. That gives them substantial flexibility to 
import or export power to compensate for wind fluctuation.</p> 
<p>Germany, for example, has 39 international interconnections, he said, 
making variable wind conditions much easier to manage.</p> <br>

<h2> Solar </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>Solar generation is about .06 percent &mdash; six hundredths of 1 percent 
(.0006) &mdash; of renewable energy consumption in the United States. EIA. June 
2006.Renewable Energy Annual. It will be hard to scale solar up to anything 
meaningful in the short time we have left to make an energy transition.</p> 
<p>According to Hoffert, in Science (1 Nov 2002):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&middot; Primary power consumption today is 12 TW, of which 85% is 
fossil-fueled. The electrical equivalent of 10 TW would require a PV array of 
85,000 square miles, more than all the land in Kansas. Yet during the 16 years 
from 1982 to 1998, only 1.16 square miles of PV cells were produced.</li> 
<li>&middot; Even if PV and wind turbine manufacturing rates increased as 
required, existing grids could not manage the loads. Present hub-and-spoke 
networks were designed for central power plants, ones that are close to users. 
Such networks need to be reengineered.</li> </ul> 
<p>At the rate of production Hoffert cites above, it would take over a million 
years to produce enough PV cells. The land required, 85,000 square miles, would 
be unavailable for ranching, farming, forests, and might cause unknown climate 
changes and certainly have a large environmental impact.</p> 
<p>The areas used for centralized solar farms are limited geographically to 
the desert areas of the Southwest, and would require very expensive 
transmission investments.</p> 
<p>While the sun is shining, you need to store the energy in batteries (which 
require other intermediary components) so you can use the energy later and in a 
more powerful and concentrated way. And you need to deliver the energy to 
customers. The solar energy to build and maintain the grid, &mdash; the 
batteries, inverters, generators, substations, transmission lines, and so on, 
exceeds the energy these components will produce in their lifetime.</p> 
<p><strong>Photovoltaic Solar</strong></p> 
<p>Although sunlight is renewable, photovoltaic panels aren&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>PV isn&rsquo;t ready yet. NREL (National Renewable Energy Lab) lists the 
technical barriers below:PV Roadmap. U.S. Dept of Energy National Center for 
Photovoltaics.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lack of widespread availability of low-cost feedstock and packaging 
materials</li> 
<li>Performance and manufacturing costs of high-efficiency silicon, thin-film, 
and concentrator cells and modules</li> 
<li>Improved reliability of modules and, especially, of balance-of-systems 
components</li> 
<li>Lack of standard products, packages, and service offerings</li> 
<li>Need for Manufacturing Center of Excellence</li> 
<li>Lack of knowledge of high-throughput processes</li> 
<li>Lack of standard module electrical/ mechanical &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo;
</li> </ul> 
<p>Photovoltaic (PV) performance in the real world is often much less than 
what the manufacturer claims. There are losses due to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Panels accumulate dust.</li> 
<li>In winter, the angle of the sun in winter is lower, so sunlight has to 
travel a greater distance through the atmosphere.</li> 
<li>The further north you go the more solar power diminishes.</li> 
<li>The air is often clogged with dust, pollution, or water vapor.</li> 
<li>PV takes a beating under the sun all day, the thin-film variety, which 
it&rsquo;s possible to produce in large quantities, and efficiency declines, 
producing less electricity.</li> </ul> 
<p>Large-scale solar PV farms need to be located in desert areas, where 
there&rsquo;s very little water to rinse off the dust that accumulates.&nbsp; 
In 2013 the world&rsquo;s largest solar-thermal plant will open, and it will 
need 600 acre-feet of groundwater to wash off dust and cool auxiliary 
equipment.&nbsp; Desert groundwater is not renewable.&nbsp; Meanwhile, sand 
storms will scour the surfaces of panels and other equipment, leading to 
reduced power and efficiency.</p> 
<p>The amount of energy embodied in the full solar structure is far more than 
PV panels. It&rsquo;s the energy required to build the PV manufacturing plant, 
to mine and deliver the silicon and copper, solar tracking systems, aluminum 
frames, concrete foundations, transmission subsystems, inverters, batteries, 
cement platforms, cabling, transformers, control systems, storage subsystems, 
backup power, the energy costs of delivering the PV components to the site 
where they&rsquo;ll be used.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;For solar power, the life cycle for solar photovoltaic systems 
requires the use of hazardous materials which must be minded from the earth and 
can contaminate areas of land when such systems break down or are destroyed, 
such as during hurricanes and tornados.&nbsp; Chemical pollution has also been 
noted to occur durnig the manufacturing phase of solar cells and 
modules&rdquo;. p28 of &ldquo;The Routledge Handbook of Energy Security&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Photovoltaic cells are made from silicon not pure enough to make computer 
chips. Computers need one of the most pure substances ever made &ndash; silicon 
that&rsquo;s 99.9999999% pure, or &ldquo;seven nines&rdquo; of purity. That 
means if you had jars with ten million pennies, only one could be a misplaced 
nickel. Solar panels require less purity &ndash; &ldquo;six nines&rdquo;, which 
means you could have ten nickels. The solar industry feeds off the rejected 
scraps. Only a few firms make purified silicon, because these manufacturing 
facilities cost over two hundred million dollars and three years to build.</p> 
<p>Tom Abate. Sep 4, 2006. Chip material shortage spooks Silicon Valley. San 
Francisco Chronicle.</p> 
<p>To make silicon this pure, a lot of energy is used. Quartz rocks must be 
ground up and then heated to 2500 degrees Farenheit. It takes 800 kWh of 
electrical energy to make a 200-mm semiconductor wafer. If we assume this cell 
has an efficiency of 10% and don&rsquo;t even count the energy to deliver it to 
a site or store the energy and retrieve it at 100% efficiency, it will take 145 
years to produce as much energy as was used making it. (Assuming the PV cell 
produces an average of 20 watts per square meter of surface, and the cell is 
.031 square meters, which makes it capable of producing .63 watts. In one year, 
it can generate 5 kWh of energy).</p> 
<p>[Huber and Mills] Peter W. Huber and Mark P. Mils, &ldquo;No Limits: Energy 
and Technology,&rdquo; (Banc of America Securities, Energy and Power 
Conference, New York June 19,2002)</p> 
<p>The most efficient solar cells are made from expensive materials. No one 
has yet figured out how to build very efficient PV from cheap material. Cheap, 
thin, PV has a short lifespan as it grows less efficient while breaking down in 
the sun.</p> 
<p>The direct current generated by solar cells can&rsquo;t power a typical 
household&rsquo;s appliances. First it has to be converted by an inverter to 
alternating current. For a home to be completely self-sufficient, a battery 
bank is required. Acid and hydrogen gas batters are heavy, expensive, and 
potentially dangerous.</p> 
<p>A PV plant that could produce 5.5 TWh of power (what the Glen Canyon dam 
produces) would displace an enormous ecosystem, about 20 square miles. It 
requires 177,788 MT (megatons) of aluminum, 2,222,356 MT cement, 480,029 MT 
copper, 7,556,010 MWh of electricity, and 4,600,276 MT of steel. (S. Pacca, D. 
Horvath 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Building &amp; Operating Electric 
Power Plants in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Env Sci &amp; Tech /Vol 36, # 
14 3194-3200)</p> 
<p>Ted Trainer estimates that building a PV power plant would cost <em>at least
</em> 48 times as much as building a coal power plant. 2003. Renewable Energy: 
What are the Limits?</p> 
<p>If the PV panels use a tracking system to capture as much sunlight as 
possible as it arcs across the sky, it may not track properly, and the energy 
to build and to move the solar panels to track the sun must be subtracted from 
the energy gains.</p> 
<p>PV for home use is still far too expensive for the average household to 
afford, and very complex to maintain and repair. And a PV system isn&rsquo;t 
merely PV panels, there are many other components involved, such as Charge 
Controllers, Inverters, Fuse Blocks, devices to feed the power to the grid, or 
if it&rsquo;s an off-grid system, batteries and an oil-based generator to keep 
the batteries from being drained. All of these products can break down, 
requiring maintenance or replacement, and require energy to build.</p> 
<p>The amount of PV that can be effectively used on buildings is limited by 
how much of the roof faces south and whether trees shade the roof.</p> 
<p>Non-PV Solar Farms</p> 
<p>Solar farms of any kind are vulnerable to high winds, hail, tornadoes, 
storms, hurricanes, and sand storms scouring the mirrors. Large amounts of 
water are needed to rinse off the mirrors.</p> 
<p>Howard Hayden estimates Solar Two would need to take up 127 square miles to 
produce as much energy as a 1000-MWe power plant does in one year. (Solar 
Fraud, p. 187).</p> 
<p>According to Robert Bradley Jr, Solar One was very disappointing. This 
solar thermal 10-megawatt project was mainly funded by the Dept of Energy and 
run by Southern California Edison for high demand periods. It closed in 1988 
after six years. The facility was so experimental and expensive that no cost 
per kwh was publicly revealed (Robert Bradley, Conversation with Mark 
Skowronski, former project director, Solar One Project, Southern California 
Edison, January 19, 1996).Robert Bradley. <em>Why Renewable Energy is not cheap 
and not green.</em> NCPA.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Bradley has to say about Solar Two, a $48 million, 
10-megawatt demonstration project that began producing electricity in 1996: 
&ldquo;In place of a parabolic dish, this project uses a receiver tower where 
the concentrated heat from the field mirrors (called heliostats) is converted 
to electricity. Its $4,000 per kilowatt installed cost &mdash; which would have 
been as much as $14,000 more per kilowatt if Solar One&rsquo;s equipment had 
not been utilized &mdash; is still between five and 10 times greater than a 
gas-fired plant under current technology. An annual operating cost of $3 
million virtually ensures a shutdown in 1999, the year federal subsidies are 
scheduled to terminate&rdquo;.Robert Bradley. <em>Why Renewable Energy is not 
cheap and not green.</em> NCPA.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Solar Two looks good on paper, and it is expected to provide steady 
baseload electricity as well as late afternoon peaking capacity, but the future 
of all the central solar generators is in doubt. They are expensive to build, 
their very scale escalates financial risks &mdash; as with nuclear power 
&mdash; and their massive height (in excess of 200 meters) may attract 
opposition&rdquo;. Christopher Flavin and Nicholas Lenssen, Power Surge, p. 143.
</p> 
<p>Solar Two took up quite a bit of land for the power being generated. There 
were 1,900 mirrored panels, each one over 100 square yards, and the results 
were only one megawatt per 17 acres of capacity. A natural gas facility taking 
up that much space would generate 150 times as much power.Robert Bradley. <em>
Why Renewable Energy is not cheap and not green.</em> NCPA.</p> 
<p>Central-station solar requires between five and 17 acres per megawatt, and 
more than 1,000 times the material of a gas-fired power plant. A 1,000 MW solar 
plant needs 35,000 tons of aluminum, 2 million tons of concrete, 7,500 tons of 
copper, 600,000 tons of steel, 75,000 tons of glass, 1,500 tons of chromium and 
titanium, and other materials. The energy that goes into the construction of a 
solar thermal-electric plant is, in fact, so large that it raises serious 
questions of whether the energy will ever be paid back. (Petr Beckmann. 1979.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>Plants have spent billions of years perfecting solar power, and yet 
they&rsquo;re only able to use a small fraction of the suns energy. Is it 
perhaps a big grandiose to think we can invent better solar machines in a few 
decades than evolution accomplished over billions of years?</p> 
<p>Solar energy is renewable, but the equipment to implement solar energy is 
not renewable. It is built with fossil fuels from mining and fabrication to 
delivery. The weighty infrastructure to harvest solar radiation would be a 
parasite on the remaining fossil fuel, upon which it is utterly dependent, and 
would subsist only as long as its &ldquo;host&rdquo; fossil fuels survived.</p> 
<p>Solar power would be most effectively used in new home construction, or 
retrofitting older homes to be as &ldquo;passively solar&rdquo; as possible, so 
they remain cool in the day and warm at night to minimize the need for heating 
or air conditioning. Fifteenth century stone homes with shutters require far 
less energy to heat and cool than shoddily built McMansions and manufactured 
homes (&ldquo;trailers&rdquo;) in the United States.</p> 
<p>Despite all of my hazing of solar power, if there is ever a Manhattan 
energy project, solar and wind are the best and only long-range solutions. If 
energy, time, and money are misguidedly spent on coal liquefaction, oil/tar 
sands, methane hydrates, and other finite fossil fuel resources, which also 
increase global warming, not only do we risk polluting the air, water, and 
ground to the point of potential mass extinctions, we are only delaying the 
inevitable energy contraction, and even more people will be born in the 
meantime to fall off an even higher cliff.</p>

<h2> 38 reasons Algae will never replace oil </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by 
energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<h1><strong>Algae</strong></h1> 
<p>The best use for algae is not biofuels but as a way to store the carbon 
dioxide from coal power plants, as described in Benemann&rsquo;s 2003 
&ldquo;Biofixation of CO2 and Greenhouse gas abatement with microalgae &ndash; 
Technology Roadmap.</p> 
<p>This is a quick summary of the problems with making fuel from algae:</p> 
<p><strong>Is more energy used to make algae biofuel than is created? (EROEI)
</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp; Keep water in ponds or plastic tubing within a narrow range of 
optimal temperature no matter how hot or cold the outside temperature is</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp; Algae diseases and infections (takes energy to remove them)</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp; Algae predators (takes energy to kill them)</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp; Keep competing low-fat strains of algae out and kill them (but not 
the good algae)</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp; Prevent overcrowding</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp; Keep pH levels constant</p> 
<p>7)&nbsp; Keep saline levels constant</p> 
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp; Pump water into the ponds</p> 
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep water aerated and circulating</p> 
<p>10)&nbsp; Keep water levels constant despite evaporation and rainfall</p> 
<p>11)&nbsp; Purify the water</p> 
<p>12)&nbsp; Inject CO2</p> 
<p>13)&nbsp; Remove waste oxygen</p> 
<p>14) Feed the algae: make, transport, and deliver nutrients such as nitrogen 
and phosphorous</p> 
<p>15)&nbsp; Harvest algae &mdash; a very small fraction of the overall water 
volume.</p> 
<p>16) Separate algae fats from water, protein, carbohydrates etc.,</p> 
<p>17)&nbsp; Sterilize strainers after processing</p> 
<p>18)&nbsp; It takes energy to build the algae pond, harvesting 
infrastructure, and maintenance</p> 
<p>19) Treat waste water</p> 
<p>20)&nbsp; Infrastructure to take the waste water somewhere</p> 
<p>21) Bio-engineered superalgae may be even more vulnerable to disease and 
predators than the hardy, tested-by-nature natural strains used now</p> 
<p><strong>Where&rsquo;s the land?&nbsp; </strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp; It must be flat land that can be flooded.&nbsp; Most suitable land 
that&rsquo;s flat is already being used to produce food.</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp; The land with the best sunlight typically have no water, i.e. 
deserts</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp; The land must be near a lot of water that doesn&rsquo;t compete 
with cities and agriculture.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp; The amount of land required to produce meaningful amounts of fuel 
could destroy ecosystems</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp; Where is there an area of land that gets plenty of sunlight but 
doesn&rsquo;t get cold at night?</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp; If the land is far from cities, the energy to transport the algae 
biofuel could be more than the energy used to deliver it.</p> 
<p>7)&nbsp; Will the methane from the anaerobic sediments increase CO2 
emissions?</p> 
<p><strong>Does it scale up? Is it too expensive?</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp; Algae that do well in the laboratory usually don&rsquo;t survive 
in the field</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp; Algae that are high-fat reproduce slowly.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp; Enclosed facilities use polycarbonate, which lasts only 10-15 years
</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp; How can you justify the expense of enclosed facilities, the time 
and expense of keeping the innards clean and preventing algae sticking to them?
</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp; Bioreactors that are efficient in the lab can&rsquo;t be scaled up 
to an industrial level</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp; DOE cut the algae fuel research a long time ago it was so 
unpromising</p> 
<p>7) Algae produce oil to protect themselves from long periods of darkness 
(night) and lack of food. But when in this stress mode, they grow very 
slowly.&nbsp; To try to make them grow faster goes against their very nature!
</p> 
<p>  Not one algae producer has been profitable or produced useful quantities 
of oil as of October 2011.</p> 
<p>9) The only companies that make money on algae today are the ones who 
harvest omega-3 fatty acids for nutritional supplements at a price much higher 
than the cost of crude oil, or for use in cosmetics.</p> 
<p>10) another company, Solazyme in South San Francisco, sold the U.S.Navy 
algal fuel for over 8.5 million dollars of algae biofuel at $424 a 
gallon!&nbsp; Oil right now is $3.85 at the gas station nearest to my house.</p>
<p>Because of high costs, 18 years of algae hydrogen and biodiesel fuel 
research was terminated (after two decades) by the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory as described in John Sheehan et al. 1998. &ldquo;A Look Back at the 
U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Aquatic Species Program&mdash;Biodiesel from 
Algae&rdquo;. Prepared for:U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Office of Fuels 
Development.&nbsp; One of the reasons was that it was very obvious that the 
nutrients being added to grow the algae was costing far more than any oil that 
could ever be produced.</p> 
<p>Japan also spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to make algae into 
fuel, and didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p> 
<p>Current algae research</p> 
<p>Labs are bioengineering and zapping algae with radiation and chemicals to 
come up with a prolific mutant strain, so far without any luck.&nbsp; Venter 
sampled algae all over the globe to look for a winning strain with no luck and 
has decided to make the magic algae himself from bits and pieces of genetic 
parts.</p> 
<p>The cost of algae food continues to be a problem.&nbsp; The cheapest food 
is Brazilian sugar cane, and that is still too expensive.</p> 
<p>Synthetic biology company Amyris&rsquo;s chief technology officer, Neil 
Renninger says that we ware never going to replace petroleum with algae, at 
best we can hope to augment oil (as is done with ethanol now).</p>

<h2> Peak Soil: Why Cellulosic and other Biofuels are Not Sustainable and a 
Threat to America&rsquo;s National Security </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by 
energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>Alice Friedemann.&nbsp; 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Last updated 2012 March 15
<br> </strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;The nation that destroys its soil destroys itself&rdquo;, President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s growing public attention from the people, all the way on down 
to the President, about biomass potential for energy.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been 
a public discussion about many aspects and what the problems might be.&nbsp; 
But there&rsquo;s one aspect of all of this that is conspicuous by its absence 
&ndash; a national discussion of anything about the soil science &ndash; the 
effect growing row crops like corn and soy have on the land and water.</p> 
<p>Whatever biomass we&rsquo;re going to grow, there are important issues 
about net energy gain and the carbon balance, but we also need to deal with the 
root of the matter &ndash; the soils, and water, and whether growing biomass 
for fuel can be made sustainable.</p> 
<p>The lack of any kind of input on this by soil scientists about how 
we&rsquo;re mining our soils is a voice that needs to be heard, because if you 
destroy the soil, you can&rsquo;t grow biomass.</p> 
<p><strong>Part 1.&nbsp; The Dirt on Dirt.<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Ethanol is an agribusiness get-rich-quick scheme that will bankrupt our 
topsoil.</p> 
<p>Nineteenth century western farmers converted their corn into whiskey to 
make a profit (Rorabaugh 1979).&nbsp; Archer Daniels Midland, a large grain 
processor, came up with the same scheme in the 20th century.&nbsp; But ethanol 
was a product in search of a market, so ADM spent three decades relentlessly 
lobbying for ethanol to be used in gasoline. Today ADM makes record profits 
from ethanol sales and government subsidies (Barrionuevo 2006).</p> 
<p>The Department of Energy hopes to have biomass supply 5% of the 
nation&rsquo;s power, 20% of transportation fuels, and 25% of chemicals by 
2030. These combined goals are 30% of the current petroleum consumption (DOE 
Biomass Plan, DOE Feedstock Roadmap).</p> 
<p>Fuels made from biomass are a lot like the nuclear powered airplanes the 
Air Force tried to build from 1946 to 1961, for billions of dollars. They never 
got off the ground.&nbsp; The idea was interesting &ndash; atomic jets could 
fly for months without refueling.&nbsp; But the lead shielding to protect the 
crew and several months of food and water was too heavy for the plane to take 
off.&nbsp; The weight problem, the ease of shooting this behemoth down, and the 
consequences of a crash landing were so obvious, it&rsquo;s amazing the project 
was ever funded, let alone kept going for 15 years.</p> 
<p>Biomass fuels have equally obvious and predictable reasons for failure. 
Odum says that time explains why renewable energy provides such low energy 
yields compared to non-renewable fossil fuels.&nbsp; The more work left to 
nature, the higher the energy yield, but the longer the time required.&nbsp; 
Although coal and oil took millions of years to form into dense, concentrated 
solar power, all we had to do was extract and transport them (Odum 1996)</p> 
<p><strong>With every step required to transform a fuel into energy, there is 
less and less energy yield</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, to make ethanol 
from corn grain, which is how all ethanol is made now, corn is first grown to 
develop hybrid seeds, which next season are planted, harvested, delivered, 
stored, and preprocessed to remove dirt.&nbsp; Dry-mill ethanol is milled, 
liquefied, heated, saccharified, fermented, evaporated, centrifuged, distilled, 
scrubbed, dried, stored, and transported to customers (McAloon 2000).</p> 
<p><strong>Fertile soil will be destroyed if crops and other 
&ldquo;wastes&rdquo; are removed to make cellulosic ethanol.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;We stand, in most places on earth, only six inches from 
desolation</strong>, for that is the thickness of the topsoil layer upon which 
the entire life of the planet depends&rdquo; (Sampson 1981).</p> 
<p><strong>Loss of topsoil has been a major factor in the fall of civilizations
</strong>(Sundquist 2005 Chapter 3, Lowdermilk 1953, Perlin 1991, Ponting 
1993).&nbsp; You end up with a country like Iraq, formerly Mesopotamia, where 
75% of the farm land is a salty desert.</p> 
<p>Fuels from biomass are not sustainable, are ecologically destructive, have 
a net energy loss, and there isn&rsquo;t enough biomass in America to make 
significant amounts of energy because essential inputs like water, land, fossil 
fuels, and phosphate ores are limited.</p> 
<p><strong>Soil Science 101 &ndash; There Is No &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; Biomass
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Long before there was &ldquo;Peak Oil&rdquo;, there was &ldquo;Peak 
Soil&rdquo;.</strong> Iowa has some of the best topsoil in the world.&nbsp; In 
the past century, half of it&rsquo;s been lost, from an average of 18 to 10 
inches deep (Pate 2004, Klee 1991).</p> 
<p><strong>Productivity drops off sharply when topsoil reaches 6 inches or less
</strong>, the average crop root zone depth (Sundquist 2005).</p> 
<p><strong>Crop productivity continually declines as topsoil is lost and 
residues are removed.&nbsp;</strong>(Al-Kaisi May 2001, Ball 2005, 
Blanco-Canqui 2006, BOA 1986, Calvi&ntilde;o 2003, Franzleubbers 2006, Grandy 
2006, Johnson 2004, Johnson 2005, Miranowski 1984, Power 1998, Sadras 2001, 
Troeh 2005, Wilhelm 2004).</p> 
<p><strong>On <em>over</em> <em>half</em> of America&rsquo;s <em>best</em> 
crop land, the erosion rate is 27 times the natural rate</strong>, 11,000 
pounds per acre (NCRS 2006). The natural, geological erosion rate is about 400 
pounds of soil per acre per year (Troeh 2005).&nbsp; Some is due to farmers not 
being paid enough to conserve their land, but most is due to investors who farm 
for profit.&nbsp; Erosion control cuts into profits.</p> 
<p><strong>Erosion is happening ten to twenty times faster than the rate 
topsoil can be formed by natural processes</strong> (Pimentel 2006).&nbsp; That 
might make the average person concerned.&nbsp; But not the USDA &mdash; 
they&rsquo;ve defined erosion as the average soil loss that could occur without 
causing a decline in long term productivity.</p> 
<p><strong>Troeh (2005) believes that the tolerable soil loss (T) value is set 
too high</strong>, because it&rsquo;s based only on the upper layers &mdash; 
how long it takes subsoil to be converted into topsoil.&nbsp; T ought to be 
based on deeper layers &ndash; the time for subsoil to develop from parent 
material or parent material from rock. &nbsp;If he&rsquo;s right, erosion is 
even worse than NCRS figures.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long way since the 1930&prime;s in reducing erosion, but 
that only makes it more insidious.&nbsp; Erosion is very hard to measure 
&mdash; very little soil might erode for years, and then tons per acre blown or 
washed away in an extreme storm just after harvest, before a cover crop has had 
a chance to protect the soil.&nbsp; We need better ways of measuring and 
monitoring erosion, since estimates wildly differ (Trimble 2000).</p> 
<p><strong>Erosion removes the most fertile parts of the soil</strong> 
(USDA-ARS).&nbsp; When you feed the soil with organic matter, you&rsquo;re not 
feeding plants; you&rsquo;re feeding the biota in the soil. Underground 
creatures and fungi break down fallen leaves and twigs into microscopic bits 
that plants can eat, and create tunnels air and water can infiltrate.&nbsp; In 
nature there are no elves feeding (fertilizing) the wild lands.&nbsp; When 
plants die, they&rsquo;re recycled into basic elements and become a part of new 
plants.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a closed cycle.&nbsp; There is no bio-waste.</p> 
<p><strong>Soil creatures and fungi act as an immune system for plants</strong>
 against diseases, weeds, and insects &ndash; when this living community is 
harmed by agricultural chemicals and fertilizers, even more chemicals are 
needed in an increasing vicious cycle (Wolfe 2001).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s so much life in the soil, there can be 10 
&ldquo;biomass horses&rdquo; underground for every horse grazing on an acre of 
pasture</strong> (Hemenway 2000). The June 2004 issue of Science calls soils 
&ldquo;The Final Frontier&rdquo;.&nbsp; Just a tiny pinch of earth could have 
10,000 different species (Wardle 2004) &mdash; millions of creatures, most of 
them unknown. &nbsp;If you dove into the soil and swam around, you&rsquo;d be 
surrounded by thousands of miles of thin strands of mycorrhizal fungi that help 
plant roots absorb more nutrients and water (Pennisi 2004). &nbsp;As you swam 
along, plant roots would tower above you like trees as you wove through 
underground skyscrapers.</p> 
<p><strong>Plants and creatures underground need to drink, eat, and breathe 
just like we do</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; An ideal soil is half rock, and a quarter 
each water and air. &nbsp;When tractors plant and harvest, they crush the life 
out of the soil, as underground apartments collapse 9/11 style. &nbsp;&nbsp;The 
tracks left by tractors in the soil are the erosion route for half of the soil 
that washes or blows away (Wilhelm 2004).</p> 
<p><strong>Corn Biofuel (i.e. butanol, ethanol, biodiesel) is especially 
harmful because</strong>:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Row crops like corn and soy cause 50 times more soil erosion than 
sod crops</strong> (Sullivan 2004) <strong>or more</strong> (Al-Kaisi 2000), 
because the soil between rows can wash or blow away. If corn is planted with 
last years corn stalks left on the ground (no-till), erosion is less of a 
problem, but only about 20% of corn is grown no-till.&nbsp; Soy is usually 
grown no-till, but has insignificant residues to harvest for fuel.</li> 
<li><strong>Corn uses more water than most crops.&nbsp; </strong>It takes 
about 118 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of corn, and 21 pounds of corn to 
make a gallon of ethanol.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>So you&rsquo;d need about 2.5 
trillion gallons of water to make a billion gallons of ethanol, more than all 
the water southern California receives from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
(Sacramento Bee 2007).</li> 
<li><strong>In the life cycle of making corn ethanol, 99% of the water used 
grows the corn, only 1% is used in the industrial process.</strong>&nbsp; From 
seed to fuel, this requires 1,500 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol.&nbsp; 
In the industrial phase, cellulosic ethanol requires twice as much water.&nbsp; 
California and other states that grow crops with irrigation rather than rain 
water would require displacing food crops with energy crops, and there already 
isn&rsquo;t enough water for food, people, and fisheries (Fingerman 2008).</li> 
<li><strong>Corn uses more agrichemicals, and fertilizer than most crops
</strong> (Padgitt 2000, Pimentel 2003). Due to high corn prices, continuous 
corn (corn crop after corn crop) is increasing, rather than rotation of 
nitrogen fixing (fertilizer) and erosion control sod crops with corn.</li> 
<li><strong>The government has studied the effect of growing continuous corn, 
and found it increaseseutrophication by 189%, global warming by 71%, and 
acidification by 6%</strong> (Powers 2005).</li> 
<li><strong>Farmers want to plant corn on highly-erodible, water protecting, 
or wildlife sustaining Conservation Reserve Program</strong> <strong>land
</strong>. Farmers are paid not to grow crops on this land. But with high corn 
prices, farmers are now asking the Agricultural Department to release them from 
these contracts so they can plant corn on these low-producing, environmentally 
sensitive lands (Tomson 2007).</li> 
<li><strong>Crop residues are essential for soil protection, nutrition, water 
retention, and soil carbon.&nbsp;</strong>Making cellulosic ethanol from corn 
residues &mdash; the parts of the plant we don&rsquo;t eat (stalk, roots, and 
leaves) &ndash; removes water, carbon, and nutrients (Nelson, 2002, McAloon 
2000, Sheehan, 2003).</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>These practices lead to lower crop production and ultimately deserts
</strong>. Growing plants for fuel will accelerate the already unacceptable 
levels of topsoil erosion, soil carbon and nutrient depletion, soil compaction, 
water retention, water depletion, water pollution, air pollution, 
eutrophication, destruction of fisheries, siltation of dams and waterways, 
salination, loss of biodiversity, and damage to human health &nbsp;(Tegtmeier 
2004).</p> 
<p><strong>Why are soil scientists absent from the biofuels debate?</strong>
</p> 
<p>I asked 35 soil scientists why topsoil wasn&rsquo;t part of the biofuels 
debate.&nbsp; These are just a few of the responses from the ten who replied to 
my off-the-record poll (no one wanted me to quote them, mostly due to fear of 
losing their jobs):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&rdquo;I have no idea why soil scientists aren&rsquo;t questioning corn 
and cellulosic ethanol plans.&nbsp; Quite frankly I&rsquo;m not sure that our 
society has had any sort of reasonable debate about this with all the facts 
laid out.&nbsp; When you see that even if all of the corn was converted to 
ethanol and that would not provide more than 20% of our current liquid fuel 
use, it certainly makes me wonder, even before considering the conversion 
efficiency, soil loss, water contamination, food price problems, etc.&rdquo;
</li> 
<li>Biomass production is not sustainable. Only business men and women in the 
refinery business believe it is.</li> 
<li>&ldquo;Should we be using our best crop land to grow gasohol and 
contribute further to global warming?&nbsp; What will our children grow their 
food on?&rdquo;</li> 
<li>&ldquo;As agricultural scientists, we are programmed to make 
farmer&rsquo;s profitable, and therefore profits are at the top of the list, 
and not&nbsp;soil, family, or environmental sustainability&rdquo;.</li> 
<li>&ldquo;Government policy since WWII has been to encourage overproduction 
to keep food prices down (people with full bellies don&rsquo;t revolt or object 
too much).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to make a living farming commodities when the 
selling price is always at or below the break even point.&nbsp; Farmers have 
had to get bigger and bigger to make ends meet since the margins keep getting 
thinner and thinner.&nbsp; We have sacrificed our family farms in the name of 
cheap food.&nbsp; When farmers stand to make few bucks (as with biofuels) 
agricultural scientists tend to look the other way&rdquo;.</li> 
<li>You are quite correct in your concern that soil science should be factored 
into decisions about biofuel production.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we soil 
scientists have missed the boat on the importance of soil management to the 
sustainability of biomass production, and the long-term impact for soil 
productivity.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>This is not a new debate</strong>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s what 
scientists had to say decades ago:</p> 
<p><strong>Removing &ldquo;crop residues&hellip;would rob organic matter that 
is vital to the maintenance of soil fertility and tilth, leading to disastrous 
soil erosion levels</strong>.&nbsp; Not considered is the importance of plant 
residues as a primary source of energy for soil microbial activity. The most 
prudent course, clearly, is to continue to recycle most crop residues back into 
the soil, where they are vital in keeping organic matter levels high enough to 
make the soil more open to air and water, more resistant to soil erosion, and 
more productive&rdquo; (Sampson 1981).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;<strong>Massive alcohol production from our farms is an 
immoral use of our soils since it rapidly promotes their wasting away.&nbsp; We 
must save these soils for an oil-less future</strong>&rdquo; (Jackson 1980).</p>
<p>Gasohol was made so poorly in the 80&prime;s that the name was changed to 
ethanol.</p> 
<p><strong>What the USDA knew about continuous corn in 1911:</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;When the rich, black, prairie corn lands of the Central West were 
first broken up, it was believed that these were &hellip; inexhaustible lands 
&hellip;&nbsp; So crop after crop of corn was planted on the same fields.&nbsp; 
There came a time, however, after 15 or 20 years, when the crop did not respond 
to cultivation; the yields fell off and the lands that once produced 60-70 
bushels per acre annually dropped to 25 to 30 bushels.</p> 
<p>&hellip;&nbsp; With the passing years, the soil became more compact, 
droughts were more injurious, and the soil baked harder and was more difficult 
to handle. Continuous corn culture has no place in progressive 
farming&hellip;it is a shortsighted policy and is suicidal on lands that have 
been long under cultivation&rdquo; (Smith 1911).</p> 
<p><strong>Natural Gas in Agriculture</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Fertilizer energy&rdquo; is 28% of the energy used in 
agriculture</strong> (Heller, 2000).&nbsp; Fertilizer uses natural gas both as 
a feedstock and the source of energy to create the high temperatures and 
pressures necessary to coax inert nitrogen out of the air (nitrogen is often 
the limiting factor in crop production).</p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizers only replace nutrition</strong>.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t 
provide the ecosystem services that organic matter does.&nbsp; Organic matter 
is known as &ldquo;waste&rdquo; in the biofuels industry.</p> 
<p>Organic matter slows erosion and fixes carbon in the soil.&nbsp; Dead 
plants and the soil biota that feed on them create channels that let air and 
water get to plant roots, which breathe and drink just like we do.&nbsp; The 
soil retains water, helping plants get through droughts.</p> 
<p>Organic matter provides food for the soil biota, which provide an immune 
system for plants.&nbsp; The mycorrhizal fungi in the soil provide plants extra 
nutrients and water in exchange for sugars.</p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizer not only provides no ecosystem services, it harms the 
ecosystem</strong>.&nbsp; Fertilizer disables or kills some of the creatures in 
the soil web, which increases the need for agrichemicals in an increasingly 
vicious cycle.</p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizers increase global warming, acid rain, and eutrophication
</strong>.</p> 
<p>You can grow tomatoes on rocks if you dump enough fertilizer on them. But 
doing so depletes the soil, we mine it when we do this.</p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizer represents 28% of the energy used in agriculture</strong>
.&nbsp; So let me get this straight.&nbsp; Fertilizers are made from and with 
natural gas which we&rsquo;re dumping on crops to grow them for biofuel.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;re going to take the biomass waste away, which means we&rsquo;ll have 
to add even more fertilizer. How, exactly, does that lessen our dependence on 
fossil fuels?</p> 
<p><strong>OK, one good thing, sort of</strong>. Fertilizer is part of the 
green revolution that made it possible for the world&rsquo;s population to grow 
from half a billion to 6.5 billion today (Smil 2000, Fisher 2001).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
So I&rsquo;m biting the hand that feeds me and four billion plus others who 
wouldn&rsquo;t be alive otherwise.&nbsp; But natural gas is limited, not easily 
imported, and it&rsquo;s depleting faster than oil on the North American 
continent. Discontinuities clearly lie ahead.</p> 
<p><strong>Our national security is at risk as we deplete our aquifers and 
become dependent on unstable foreign states to provide us with increasingly 
expensive fertilizer</strong>. &nbsp;Between 1995 and 2005 we increased our 
fertilizer imports by more than 148% for Anhydrous Ammonia, 93% for Urea 
(solid), and 349 % of other nitrogen fertilizers (USDA ERS).&nbsp; Removing 
crop residues will require large amounts of imported fertilizer from potential 
cartels, potentially so expensive farmers won&rsquo;t sell crops and residues 
for biofuels.</p> 
<p><strong>Improve national security and topsoil by returning residues to the 
land as fertilizer</strong>. We are vulnerable to high-priced fertilizer 
imports or &ldquo;food for oil&rdquo;, which would greatly increase the cost of 
food for Americans. &nbsp;Return crop residues to the soil to provide organic 
fertilizer, don&rsquo;t increase the need for natural gas fertilizers by 
removing crop residues to make cellulosic biofuels.</p> 
<p><strong>Part 2. The Poop on Ethanol:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI)</strong></p> 
<p>To understand the concept of EROEI, imagine a magician doing a variation on 
the rabbit-out-of-a-hat trick.&nbsp; He strides onstage with a rabbit, puts it 
into a top hat, and then spends the next five minutes pulling 100 more rabbits 
out. That is a pretty good return on investment!</p> 
<p>Oil was like that in the beginning: one barrel of oil energy was required 
to get 100 more out, an Energy Returned on Energy Invested of 100:1.</p> 
<p>When the biofuel magician tries to do the same trick decades later, he puts 
the rabbit into the hat, and pulls out only one pooping rabbit.&nbsp; The 
excrement is known as byproduct or coproduct in the ethanol industry.</p> 
<p>Studies that show a positive energy gain for ethanol would have a negative 
return if the byproduct were left out (Farrell 2006).&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s 
where byproduct comes from: if you made ethanol from corn in your back yard, 
you&rsquo;d dump a bushel of corn, two gallons of water, and yeast into your 
contraption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out would come 18 pounds of ethanol, 18 pounds of CO2, 
and 18 pounds of byproduct &ndash; the leftover corn solids.</p> 
<p>Patzek and Pimentel believe you shouldn&rsquo;t include the energy 
contained in the byproduct, because you need to return it to the soil to 
improve nutrition and soil structure (Patzek June 2006).&nbsp; Giampetro 
believes the byproduct should be treated as a &ldquo;serious waste disposal 
problem and &hellip; an energy cost&rdquo;, because if we supplied 10% of our 
energy from biomass, we&rsquo;d generate 37 times more livestock feed than is 
used (Giampetro 1997).</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse than he realized &ndash; Giampetro didn&rsquo;t know 
most of this &ldquo;livestock feed&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be fed to livestock 
because it&rsquo;s too energy and monetarily expensive to deliver &ndash; 
especially heavy wet distillers byproduct, which is short-lived, succumbing to 
mold and fungi after 4 to 10 days. Also, byproduct is a subset of what animals 
eat.&nbsp; Cattle are fed byproduct in 20% of their diet at most.&nbsp; 
Iowa&rsquo;s a big hog state, but commercial swine operations feed pigs a 
maximum of 5 to 10% byproduct (Trenkle 2006; Shurson 2003).</p> 
<p>Worst of all, the EROEI of ethanol is 1.2:1 or 1.2 units of energy out for 
every unit of energy in, a gain of &ldquo;.2&rdquo;.&nbsp; The &ldquo;1&rdquo; 
in &ldquo;1.2&rdquo; represents the liquid ethanol.&nbsp; What is the 
&ldquo;.2&rdquo; then?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the rabbit feces &ndash; the byproduct. 
So you have no ethanol for your car, because the liquid &ldquo;1&rdquo; needs 
to be used to make more ethanol.&nbsp; That leaves you with just the 
&ldquo;.2&rdquo; &mdash; a bucket of byproduct to feed your horse &ndash; you 
do have a horse, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; If horses are like cattle, then you can 
only use your byproduct for one-fifth of his diet, so you&rsquo;ll need four 
supplemental buckets of hay from your back yard to feed him.&nbsp; No doubt the 
byproduct could be used to make other things, but that would take energy.</p> 
<p>Byproduct could be burned, but it takes a significant amount of energy to 
dry it out, and requires additional handling and equipment.&nbsp; More money 
can be made selling it wet to the cattle industry, which is hurting from the 
high price of corn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Byproduct should be put back into the ground to 
improve soil nutrition and structure for future generations, not sold for 
short-term profit and fed to cattle who aren&rsquo;t biologically adapted to 
eating corn.</p> 
<p><strong>The boundaries of what is included in EROEI calculations are kept 
as narrow as possible to reach positive results.</strong></p> 
<p>Researchers who find a positive EROEI for ethanol have not accounted for 
all of the energy inputs.&nbsp; For example, Shapouri admits the &ldquo;energy 
used in the production of &hellip; farm machinery and equipment&hellip;, and 
cement, steel, and stainless steel used in the construction of ethanol plants, 
are not included&rdquo;. (Shapouri 2002).&nbsp; Or they assign overstated 
values of ethanol yield from corn (Patzek Dec 2006).&nbsp; Many, many, other 
inputs are left out.</p> 
<p>Patzek and Pimentel have compelling evidence showing that about 30 percent 
more fossil energy is required to produce a gallon of ethanol than you get from 
it.&nbsp; Their papers are published in peer-reviewed journals where their data 
and methods are public, unlike many of the positive net energy results.</p> 
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>.&nbsp; Current EROEI figures don&rsquo;t 
take into account the delivery infrastructure that needs to be built.&nbsp; 
There are 850 million combustion engines in the world today.&nbsp; Just to 
replace half the 245 million cars and light trucks in the United States with 
E85 vehicles will take 12-15 years, It would take over $544 million dollars of 
delivery ethanol infrastructure (Reynolds 2002 case B1) and $5 to $34 billion 
to revamp 170,000 gas stations nationwide (Heinson 2007).</p> 
<p>The EROEI of oil when we built most of the infrastructure in this country 
was about 100:1, and it&rsquo;s about 25:1 worldwide now.&nbsp; Even if you 
believe ethanol has a positive EROEI, you&rsquo;d probably need at least an 
EROEI of at least 5 to maintain modern civilization (Hall 2003).&nbsp; A 
civilization based on ethanol&rsquo;s &ldquo;.2&rdquo; rabbit poop would only 
work forcoprophagous rabbits.</p> 
<p>Of the four articles that showed a positive net energy for ethanol in 
Farrells 2006 Science article, three were<em>not</em> 
peer-reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only positive peer-reviewed article (Dias De 
Oliveira, 2005) states &ldquo;The use of ethanol as a substitute for gasoline 
proved to be neither a sustainable nor an environmentally friendly 
option&rdquo; and the &ldquo;environmental impacts outweigh its 
benefits&rdquo;. Dias De Oliveria concluded there&rsquo;d be a tremendous loss 
of biodiversity, and if all vehicles ran on E85 and their numbers grew by 4% 
per year, by 2048, the entire country, except for cities, would be covered with 
corn.</p> 
<p><strong>Part 3. &nbsp;Biofuel is a Grim Reaper.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The energy to remediate environmental damage is left out of EROEI 
calculations.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Global Warming</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Soils contain 3.3 times the amount of carbon found in the 
atmosphere, and 4.5 times more carbon than is stored in all the Earth&rsquo;s 
vegetation (Lal 2004).</strong></p> 
<p><strong>If we want to reduce global warming, storing carbon in the soil 
will be essential</strong>.&nbsp; But that will be hard to pull off, because 
<strong>Climate change could increase soil loss by 33% to 274%, depending on 
the region</strong> (O&rsquo;Neal 2005).</p> 
<p>Worse yet, we keep building suburbia and shopping malls on top of crop land.
</p> 
<p><strong>Population in the United States could reach over one billion people 
by 2100</strong> (U.S. Census Bureau 2000), so what will happen is that 
we&rsquo;ll need more crop land and have to cut down bottomland forests and 
fill in wetlands to grow food, which will reduce stored carbon and biodiversity 
even further.</p> 
<p><strong>Intensive agriculture has already removed 20 to 50% of the original 
soil carbon</strong>, and some areas have lost 70%. To maintain soil C levels, 
no crop residues at all could be harvested under many tillage systems or on 
highly erodible lands, and none to a small percent on no-till, depending on 
crop production levels (Johnson 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>Deforestation of temperate hardwood forests, and conversion of 
range and wetlands to grow energy and food crops increases global warming
</strong>. An average of 2.6 million acres of crop land were paved over or 
developed every year between 1982 and 2002 in the USA (NCRS 2004). The only new 
crop land is forest, range, or wetland.</p> 
<p><strong>Rainforest destruction is increasing global warming</strong>
.&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy farming is playing a huge role in deforestion, reducing 
biodiversity, water and water quality, and increasing soil erosion. Fires to 
clear land for palm oil plantations are destroying one of the last great 
remaining rainforests in Borneo, spewing so much carbon that Indonesia is third 
behind the United States and China in releasing greenhouse gases.&nbsp; 
Orangutans, rhinos, tigers and thousands of other species may be driven extinct 
(Monbiot 2005). Borneo palm oil plantation lands have grown 2,500% since 1984 
(Barta 2006). Soybeans cause even more erosion than corn and suffer from all 
the same sustainability issues.&nbsp; The Amazon is being destroyed by farmers 
growing soybeans for food (Wallace 2007) and fuel (Olmstead 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>Biofuel from coal-burning biomass factories increases global warming
</strong> (Farrell 2006).&nbsp; Driving a mile on ethanol from a coal-using 
biorefinery releases more CO2 than a mile on gasoline (Ward 2007). Coal in 
ethanol production is seen as a way to displace petroleum (Farrell 2006, 
Yacobucci 2006) and it&rsquo;s already happening (Clayton 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>Current and future quantities of biofuels are too minuscule to 
affect global warming</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;(ScienceDaily 2007).</p> 
<p><strong>Surface Albedo</strong>. &ldquo;How much the sun warms our climate 
depends on how much sunlight the land reflects (cooling us), versus how much it 
absorbs (heating us). A plausible 2% increase in the absorbed sunlight on a 
switch grass plantation could negate the climatic cooling benefit of the 
ethanol produced on it. We need to figure out now, not later, the full range of 
climatic consequences of growing cellulose crops&rdquo; (Harte 2007).</p> 
<p><strong>Soil Erosion </strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s an ethanol gold rush going on.&nbsp; </strong>More 
than half the best farmland in the United States is leased by investors. 
Two-thirds or more of the farmland in the corn and soy growing states of Iowa, 
Minnesota, Illinois, and Indiana is rented (65, 74, 84, and 86% respectively).
</p> 
<p>Notice that these mostly investor-owned corn and soybean growing states, 
are mainly red in the map below.&nbsp; Red represents the areas where farms 
have the highest erosion rates.</p> 
<p><strong>Corn and soy crops have higher erosion rates than most crops
</strong>. &nbsp;Storms and wind wash agrichemicals (sometimes highly toxic 
ones that haven&rsquo;t had a chance to break down) and eroded soil into the 
air and water.&nbsp; Sediment fills up reservoirs, shortening their life-span 
and the time dams can store water and generate electricity.&nbsp; Yet the 
energy of the hydropower lost to siltation, energy to remediate flood damage, 
energy to dredge dams, agricultural drainage ditches, harbors, and navigation 
channels, aren&rsquo;t considered in EROEI calculations.</p> 
<p>Owners seeking short-term profits have far less incentive than farmers who 
work their land to preserve soil and water. They don&rsquo;t adopt as long-term 
conservation measures as farm owner-operators do (ERS 1999).</p> 
<p>
http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/ConservationAndEnvironment/Gallery/sediment.htm
</p> 
<p><strong>Eutrophication</strong>.</p> 
<p>The dark green areas of this map represent where the highest crop subsidy 
payments go and where the highest nitrogen runoff rates are. Notice that again, 
these areas correspond&nbsp; with investor-owned farmland.&nbsp; Commodity 
payments were meant to be a safety net, but the money ends up being used to buy 
and apply excess fertilizer, which gets into rivers, lakes, and oceans (Redlin 
2007).</p> 
<p>Farm runoff of nitrogen fertilizers has contributed to the pollution and 
hypoxia (low oxygen) of rivers and lakes across the country and the 8,000 
square mile dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Yet the cost of the lost 
shrimp and fisheries and increased cost of water treatment are not subtracted 
from the EROEI of ethanol.</p> 
<p>Climate change also appears to be increasing runoff and erosion (SWCS 2003).
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>http://www.iwla.org/publications/agriculture/Farm_Bill_2007_WEB.pdf</p> 
<p><strong>Water Pollution</strong></p> 
<p>Soil erosion is a serious source of water pollution, since it causes runoff 
of sediments, nutrients, salts, eutrophication, and chemicals that have had no 
chance to decompose into streams. This increases water treatment costs, 
increases health costs, kills fish with insecticides that work their way up the 
food chain (Troeh 2005).</p> 
<p>Ethanol plants pollute water.&nbsp; They generate 13 liters of wastewater 
for every liter of ethanol produced (Pimentel March 2005)</p> 
<p><strong>Water depletion</strong></p> 
<p>Biofuel factories use a huge amount of water &ndash; four gallons for every 
gallon of ethanol produced.&nbsp; Despite 30 inches of rain per year in Iowa, 
there may not be enough water for corn ethanol factories as well as people and 
industry. Drought years will make matters worse (Cruse 2006).</p> 
<p>Fifty percent of Americans rely on groundwater (Glennon 2002), and in many 
states, this groundwater is being depleted by agriculture faster than it is 
being recharged.&nbsp; This is already threatening current food supplies 
(Giampetro 1997).&nbsp; In some western irrigated corn acreage, groundwater is 
being mined at a rate 25% faster than the natural recharge of its aquifer 
(Pimentel 2003).</p> 
<p><strong>Do you want to drink, eat, or drive?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Biodiversity</strong></p> 
<p>Every acre of forest and wetland converted to crop land decreases soil 
biota, insect, bird, reptile, and mammal biodiversity.</p> 
<p><strong>Honeybees</strong>.&nbsp; Springtime die-offs of honeybees from 
corn coated with insecticides was discovered in January 2012.&nbsp; Bees are 
critical for pollinating food crops &mdash; these deaths are a part of the 
mysterious colony collapse disorder (Tapparo).</p> 
<p><strong>Part 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Biodiesel: Can we eat enough French Fries?
</strong></p> 
<p>The idea we could run our economy on discarded fried food grease is very 
amusing.&nbsp; For starters, you&rsquo;d need to feed 7 million heavy diesel 
trucks getting less than 8 mpg. Seems like we&rsquo;re all going to need to eat 
a lot more French Fries, but if anyone can pull it off, it would be Americans. 
Spin it as a patriotic duty and you&rsquo;d see people out the door before the 
TV ad finished, the most popular government edict<em>ever</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Scale. Where&rsquo;s the Soy?</strong> Biodiesel is not ready for 
prime time.&nbsp; Although John Deere is working on fuel additives and 
technologies to burn more than 5% accredited biodiesel&nbsp; (made to ASTM 
D6751 specifications &ndash; vegetable oil does<em>not</em> qualify), that is a 
long way off. 52 billion gallons of diesel fuel are consumed a year in the 
United States, but only 75 million gallons of biodiesel were produced &ndash; 
two-tenths of one percent of what&rsquo;s needed. &nbsp;To get the country to 
the point where gasoline was mixed with 5 percent biodiesel would require 64 
percent of the soybean crop and 71,875 square miles of land (Borgman 2007), an 
area the size of the state of Washington.&nbsp; Soybeans cause even more 
erosion than corn.</p> 
<p>But not to worry, a lot is being grown in Brazil, where the Amazon 
rainforest is being cut down to grow it.</p> 
<p><strong>Biodiesel shortens engine life</strong>. Currently, biodiesel 
concentrations higher than 5 percent can cause &ldquo;water in the fuel due to 
storage problems, foreign material plugging filters&hellip;, fuel system seal 
and gasket failure, fuel gelling in cold weather, crankcase dilution, injection 
pump failure due to water ingestion, power loss, and, in some instances, can be 
detrimental to long engine life&rdquo; (Borgman 2007).&nbsp; Biodiesel also has 
a short shelf life and it&rsquo;s hard to store &ndash; it easily absorbs 
moisture (water is a bane to combustion engines), oxidizes, and gets 
contaminated with microbes.&nbsp; It increases engine NOx emissions (ozone) and 
has thermal degradation at high temperatures (John Deere 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>On the cusp of energy descent, we can&rsquo;t even run the most 
vital aspect of our economy, agricultural machines, on &ldquo;renewable&rdquo; 
fuels.&nbsp;</strong>John Deere tractors can run on no more than 5% accredited 
biodiesel (Borgman 2007).&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is unintentionally wise 
&ndash; biofuels have yet to be proven viable, and mechanization may not be a 
great strategy in a world of declining energy</p> 
<p><strong>Part 5. &nbsp;If we can&rsquo;t drink and drive, then burn baby 
burn.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Energy Crop Combustion.</strong></p> 
<p>Wood is a crop, subject to the same issues as corn, and takes a lot longer 
to grow.&nbsp; Burning wood in your stove at home delivers far more energy than 
the logs would if converted to biofuels (Pimentel 2005). &nbsp;Wood was scarce 
in America when there were just 75 million people.&nbsp; Electricity from 
biomass combustion is not economic or sustainable.</p> 
<p><strong>Combustion pollution is expensive to control</strong>.&nbsp; Some 
biomass has absorbed heavy metals and other pollutants from sources like coal 
power plants, industry, and treated wood. Combustion can release chlorinated 
dioxins, benzofurans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, mercury, 
arsenic, lead, nickel, and zinc.</p> 
<p><strong>Combustion contributes to global warming</strong> by adding 
nitrogen oxides and the carbon stored in plants back into the atmosphere, as 
well as removes agriculturally essential nitrogen and phosphate (Reijnders 2006)
</p> 
<p><strong>EROEI in doubt</strong>. Combustion plants need to produce, 
transport, prepare, dry, burn, and control toxic emissions.&nbsp; Collection is 
energy intensive, requiring some combination of bunchers, skidders, whole-tree 
choppers, or tub grinders, and then hauling it to the biomass 
plant.&nbsp;&nbsp; There, the feedstock is chopped into similar sizes and 
placed on a conveyor belt to be fed to the plant.&nbsp; If biomass is co-fired 
with coal, it needs to be reduced to &frac14; inch or less, and the resulting 
fly ash may not be marketable to the concrete industry (Bain 2003).&nbsp; Any 
alkali or chlorine released in combustion gets deposited on the equipment, 
reducing overall plant efficiencies, as well as accelerating corrosion and 
erosion of plant components, requiring high replacement and maintenance energy.
</p> 
<p><strong>Processing materials with different physical properties is energy 
intensive</strong>, requiring sorting, handling, drying, and chopping.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s hard to optimize the pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion 
processes if different combustible fuels are used. Urban waste requires a lot 
of sorting, since it often has material that must be removed, such as rocks, 
concrete and metal.&nbsp; The material that can be burned must also be sorted, 
since it varies from yard trimmings with high moisture content to chemically 
treated wood.</p> 
<p><strong>Biomass combustion competes with other industries</strong> that 
want this material for construction, mulch, compost, paper, and other 
profitable ventures, often driving the price of wood higher than a wood-burning 
biomass plant can afford. Much of the forest wood that could be burned is 
inaccessible due to a lack of roads.</p> 
<p><strong>Efficiency is lowered if material with a high water content is 
burned</strong>, like fresh wood. Different physical and chemical 
characteristics in fuel can lead to control problems (Badger 2002).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When wet fuel is burned, so much energy goes into vaporizing the water that 
very little energy emerges as heat, and drying takes time and energy.</p> 
<p><strong>Material is limited and expensive</strong>. California 
couldn&rsquo;t use crop residues due to low bulk density. In 2000, the 
viability of California biomass enterprise was in serious doubt because the 
energy to produce biomass was so high due to the small facilities and high cost 
of collecting and transporting material to the plants (Bain 2003).</p> 
<p><strong>Part 6. The problems with Cellulosic Ethanol could drive you to 
drink.</strong></p> 
<p>Many plants want animals to eat their seed and fruit to disperse 
them.&nbsp; Some seeds only germinate after going through an animal gut and 
coming out in ready-made fertilizer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeds and fruits are easy to 
digest compared to the rest of the plant, that&rsquo;s why<strong>all of the 
commercial ethanol and biodiesel are made from the yummy parts of plants, the 
grain</strong>, rather than the stalks, leaves, and roots.</p> 
<p>But <strong>plants don&rsquo;t want to be entirely devoured</strong>.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of millions of years perfecting structures that 
can&rsquo;t easily be eaten.&nbsp; Be thankful plants figured this out, or 
everything would be mown down to bedrock.</p> 
<p>If we ever did figure out how to break down cellulose in our back yard 
stills, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before the 6.5 billion people on the planet 
destroyed the grasslands and forests of the world to power generators and 
motorbikes (Huber 2006)</p> 
<p>Don Augenstein and John Benemann, who&rsquo;ve been researching biofuels 
for over 30 years, are skeptical as well. According to them, &ldquo;&hellip;
<strong>severe barriers remain to ethanol from lignocellulose. The barriers 
look as daunting as they did 30 years ago</strong>&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Benemann says the <strong>EROEI can be easily determined to be about five 
times as much energy required to make cellulosic ethanol than the energy 
contained in the ethanol</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>The success of cellulosic ethanol depends on finding or engineering 
organisms that can tolerate extremely high concentrations of ethanol</strong>. 
Augenstein argues that this creature would already exist if it were possible. 
Organisms have had a billion years of optimization through evolution to develop 
a tolerance to high ethanol levels (Benemann 2006).&nbsp; Someone making beer, 
wine, or moonshine would have already discovered this creature if it could 
exist.</p> 
<p><strong>The range of chemical and physical properties in biomass, even just 
corn stover</strong>(Ruth 2003, Sluiter 2000), <strong>is a challenge</strong>
.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to make cellulosic ethanol plants optimally efficient, 
because processes can&rsquo;t be tuned to such wide feedstock variation..</p> 
<p><strong>Where will the Billion Tons of Biomass for Cellulosic Fuels Come 
From?</strong></p> 
<p>Even if you uprooted every grass, shrub, crop, and tree in the United 
States for fuel, you&rsquo;d get less energy than what we consume in just one 
year from fossil fuels and nuclear power (Patzek 2005)</p> 
<p>The government believes there is a billion tons of biomass 
&ldquo;waste&rdquo; to make cellulosic biofuels, chemicals, and generate 
electricity with.</p> 
<p><strong>The </strong><strong>United States</strong><strong> lost 52 million 
acres of cropland between 1982 and 2002</strong> (NCRS 2004).&nbsp; <strong>At 
that rate, all of the cropland will be gone in 140 years</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>There isn&rsquo;t enough biomass to replace 30% of our petroleum use
</strong>.&nbsp; The potential biomass energy is miniscule compared to the 
fossil fuel energy we consume every year, about 105 exa joules (EJ) in the 
USA.&nbsp; If you burned every living plant and its roots, you&rsquo;d have 94 
EJ of energy and we could all pretend we lived on Mars.&nbsp; Most of this 94 
EJ of biomass is already being used for food and feed crops, and wood for paper 
and homes. Sparse vegetation and the 30 EJ in root systems are economically 
unavailable &ndash; leaving only a small amount of biomass unspoken for (Patzek 
June 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>Over 25% of the &ldquo;waste&rdquo; biomass is expected to come 
from 280 million tons of corn stover</strong>. Stover is what&rsquo;s left 
after the corn grain is harvested.&nbsp; Another 120 million tons will come 
from soy and cereal straw (DOE Feedstock Roadmap, DOE Biomass Plan).</p> 
<p><strong>There isn&rsquo;t enough no-till <em>corn stover</em> to harvest
</strong>.&nbsp; The success of biofuels depends on corn residues.&nbsp; About 
80% of farmers disk corn stover into the land after harvest. That renders it 
useless &mdash; the crop residue is buried in mud and decomposing rapidly.</p> 
<p>Only the 20 percent of farmers who farm no-till will have stover to 
sell.&nbsp; The DOE Billion Ton vision assumes<strong><em>all</em></strong> 
farmers are no-till,<strong>75% of residues will be harvested</strong>, <strong>
and fantasy corn and wheat yields 50% higher than now are reached</strong> (DOE 
Billion Ton Vision 2005).&nbsp; But none of this corn stover should be 
harvested because corn loses more soil than any other crop grown (Pimentel 
2007).</p> 
<p><strong>Many tons will never be available because farmers won&rsquo;t sell 
any, or much of their residue (certainly not 75%).</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Many more tons will be lost due to drought, rain, or loss in storage
</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Only half a percent of a plant can be harvested sustainably every 
year.&nbsp;</strong>Plants only fix a tiny part of solar energy into plant 
matter annually &mdash; about one-tenth to one-half of one percent new growth 
in temperate climates.</p> 
<p><strong>To prevent erosion, you could only harvest 51 million tons of corn 
and wheat residues, not 400 million tons</strong> (Nelson, 2002).&nbsp; Other 
factors, like soil structure, soil compression, water depletion, and 
environmental damage weren&rsquo;t considered. Fifty one million tons of 
residue could make about 3.8 billion gallons of ethanol, less than 1% of our 
energy needs.</p> 
<p><strong>Using corn stover is a&nbsp; problem, because corn, soy, and other 
row crops cause 50 times more soil erosion than sod crops</strong> (Sullivan 
2004)<strong>or more</strong> (Al-Kaisi 2000), <strong>and corn also uses more 
water, insecticides and fertilizers than most crops</strong> (Pimentel 2003)</p>
<p><strong>The amount of soy and cereal straw (wheat, oats, etc) is 
insignificant</strong>.&nbsp; It would be best to use cereal grain straw, 
because grains use far less water and cause far less erosion than row crops 
like corn and soybeans.&nbsp; But that isn&rsquo;t going to happen, because the 
green revolution fed billions more people by shortening grain height so that 
plant energy went into the edible seed, leaving little straw for 
biofuels.&nbsp; Often 90% of<em>soybean</em> and <em>cereal </em>straw is grown 
no-till, but the amount of cereal straw is insignificant and the soybean 
residues must remain on the field to prevent erosion</p> 
<p><strong>Energy Crops</strong></p> 
<p>Energy crops are grown specifically for their fuel value.&nbsp; Tall 
perennial grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus are being proposed as 
potential energy crops.&nbsp; Although grasses cause less erosion and need less 
fertilizer, they still suffer from the problems that all plants have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Most non-food energy crops require as much water as corn, per unit weight 
(Pimentel 2007). &nbsp;And they need a lot of water to be processed into a 
biofuel.&nbsp; The Great Plains are the most likely place energy crops would be 
planted.&nbsp; Yet the Ogallala aquifer is depleting fast and won&rsquo;t 
replenish until after the next ice age.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the water to 
process tall grass prairies into biofuels going to come from?</li> 
<li>Plants have low density compared to fossil fuels.&nbsp; If you try to 
pelletize or compact them, that takes energy, and they&rsquo;re still low 
density.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hay bales are like mattresses &ndash; you can only get so 
many on a truck, and you can&rsquo;t force them into a pipeline, which would be 
far less expensive.</li> 
<li>The larger the biorefinery, the better the economies of scale.&nbsp; 
Biofuels need to be created at a large scale for any hope of a positive energy 
balance and enough purity to be used in combustion engines, which are extremely 
fine-tuned for diesel or gasoline, fuel injection, etc.</li> 
<li>Plants aren&rsquo;t concentrated &ndash; they grow diffusely and require a 
great deal of energy to harvest and deliver to the refinery.</li> 
<li>Plants are hard to store. They rot and turn into mulch or can catch on 
fire. Storing them wet adds weight, leading to higher transportation costs and 
high water use.</li> 
<li>All plants succumb to pests and disease.&nbsp; Miscanthus is from China, 
but eventually pests will evolve to dine upon it, especially if grown in 
monocrops.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Poor, erodible land</strong>. There aren&rsquo;t enough acres of 
land to grow significant amounts of energy crops. &nbsp;Potential energy crop 
land is usually poor quality or highly erodible land that shouldn&rsquo;t be 
harvested.&nbsp; Farmers are often paid not to farm this unproductive land. 
&nbsp;Many acres in switchgrass are being used for wildlife and recreation.</p> 
<p><strong>Few suitable bio-factory sites</strong>. Biorefineries can&rsquo;t 
be built just anywhere &ndash; very few sites could be found to build 
switchgrass plants in all of South Dakota (Wu 1998).&nbsp; Much of the state 
didn&rsquo;t have enough water or adequate drainage to build an ethanol 
factory.&nbsp; The sites had to be on main roads, near railroad and natural gas 
lines, out of floodplains, on parcels of at least 40 acres to provide storage 
for the residues, have electric power, and enough biomass nearby to supply the 
plant year round.</p> 
<p><strong>No energy crop farmers or investors</strong>. Farmers won&rsquo;t 
grow switchgrass until there&rsquo;s a switchgrass plant. Machines to harvest 
and transport switchgrass efficiently don&rsquo;t exist yet (Barrionuevo 2006). 
The capital to build switchgrass plants won&rsquo;t materialize until there are 
switchgrass farmers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since &ldquo;ethanol production using 
switchgrass required 50% more fossil energy than the ethanol fuel 
produced&rdquo; (Pimentel 2005), investors for these plants will be hard to 
find.</p> 
<p><strong>Energy crops are subject to Liebig&rsquo;s law of the minimum too
</strong>. Switchgrass may grow on marginal land, but it hasn&rsquo;t escaped 
the need for minerals and water.&nbsp; Studies have shown the more rainfall, 
the more switchgrass you get, and if you remove switchgrass, you&rsquo;re going 
to need to fertilize the land to replace the lost biomass, or you&rsquo;ll get 
continually lower yields of switchgrass every time you harvest the crop (Vogel 
2002).</p> 
<p><strong>Bioinvasive Potential</strong>. These fast-growing 
disease-resistant plants are potentially bioinvasive, another kudzu. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioinvasion costs our country billions of dollars a year (Bright, 
1998).&nbsp; Johnson grass was introduced as a forage grass and it&rsquo;s now 
an invasive weed in many states.&nbsp; Another fast-growing grass, Miscanthus, 
from China, is now being proposed as a biofuel.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been described 
as &ldquo;Johnson grass on steroids&rdquo; (Raghu 2006). These foreign grasses 
do quite well because they don&rsquo;t have any pests,<em>yet</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Sugar cane: too little to import</strong>.&nbsp; Brazil uses oil 
for 90% of their energy, and 17 times less oil (Jordan 2006). Brazilian ethanol 
production in 2003 was 3.3 billion gallons, about the same as the USA in 2004, 
or 1% of our transportation energy.&nbsp; Brazil uses 85% of their cane 
ethanol, leaving only 15% for export.</p> 
<p><strong>Sugar Cane: can&rsquo;t grow it here</strong>. Although we grow 
some sugar cane despite tremendous environmental damage (WWF) in Florida thanks 
to the sugar lobby, we&rsquo;re too far north to grow a significant amount of 
sugar cane or other fast growing C4 plants.</p> 
<p>Sugar cane has been touted as an &ldquo;all you need is sunshine&rdquo; 
plant.&nbsp; But according to the FAO, the nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium 
requirements of sugar cane are roughly similar to maize (FAO 2004).</p> 
<p><strong>Wood ethanol is an energy sink.&nbsp; </strong>Ethanol production 
using wood biomass required 57% more fossil energy than the ethanol fuel 
produced (Pimentel 2005).</p> 
<p><strong>Wood is a nonrenewable resource</strong>.&nbsp; Old-growth forests 
had very dense wood, with a high energy content, but wood from fast-growing 
plantations is so low-density and low calorie it&rsquo;s not even good to burn 
in a fireplace.&nbsp; These plantations require energy to plant, fertilize, 
weed, thin, cut, and deliver.&nbsp; The trees are finally available for use 
after 20 to 90 years &ndash; too long for them to be considered a renewable 
fuel (Odum 1996). Nor do secondary forests always come back with the vigor of 
the preceding forest due to soil erosion, soil nutrition depletion, and 
mycorrhizae destruction (Luoma 1999).</p> 
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s not enough wood to fuel a civilization of 300 million 
people</strong>. Over half of North America was deforested by 1900, at a time 
when there were only 75 million people (Williams 2003). Most of this was from 
home use. In the 18th century the average Northeastern family used 10 to 20 
cords per year. At least one acre of woods is required to sustainably harvest 
one cord of wood (Whitney 1994).</p> 
<p><strong>Energy crop limits</strong>. Energy crops may not be sustainable 
due to water, fertilizer, and harvesting impacts on the soil (DOE Biomass 
Roadmap 2005). Like all other monoculture crops, ultimately yields of energy 
crops will be reduced due to &ldquo;pest problems, diseases, and soil 
degradation&rdquo; (Giampetro, 1997).</p> 
<p><strong>Energy crop monoculture.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The<strong> &ldquo;
</strong>physical and chemical characteristics of feedstocks vary by source, by 
year, and by season, increasing processing costs&rdquo; (DOE Feedstock 
Roadmap).&nbsp; That will encourage the development of genetically engineered 
biomass to minimize variation.&nbsp; Harvesting economies of scale will mean 
these crops will be grown in monoculture, just as food crops are.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s the wrong direction &ndash; to farm with less energy 
there&rsquo;ll need to be a return to rotation of diverse crops, and composted 
residues for soil nutrition, pest, and disease resistance.</p> 
<p>A way around this would be to spend more on researching how cellulose 
digesting microbes tackle different herbaceous and woody biomass.&nbsp; The 
ideal energy crop would be a perennial, tall-grass prairie / herbivore 
ecosystem (Tilman 2006).&nbsp; Tilman recommends harvesting &ldquo;all 
grassland in the U.S. for ethanol but neglects to report that 100 million 
cattle, 7 million sheep, and 4 million horses are currently grazing on this 
grass!&rdquo; (Pimentel 2007)</p> 
<p><strong>Farmers aren&rsquo;t Stupid: They won&rsquo;t sell their residues
</strong></p> 
<p>Farmers are some of the smartest people on earth or they&rsquo;d soon go 
out of business.&nbsp; They have to know everything from soil science to 
commodity futures.</p> 
<p><strong>Crop production is reduced when residues are removed from the 
soil.&nbsp; Why would farmers want to sell their residues?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Erosion, water, compression, nutrition</strong>. Harvesting of 
stover on the scale needed to fuel a cellulosic industry won&rsquo;t happen 
because farmers aren&rsquo;t stupid, especially the ones who work their own 
land.&nbsp; Although there is a wide range of opinion about the amount of 
residue that can be harvested safely without causing erosion, loss of soil 
nutrition, and soil structure, many farmers will want to be on the safe side, 
and stick with the studies showing that 20% (Nelson, 2002) to 30% (McAloon et 
al., 2000; Sheehan, 2003) at most can be harvested, not the 75% agribusiness 
claims is possible.&nbsp; Farmers also care about water quality (Lal 1998, Mann 
et al, 2002). &nbsp;And farmers will decide that permanent soil compression is 
not worth any price (Wilhelm 2004). &nbsp;As prices of fertilizer inexorably 
rise due to natural gas depletion, it will be cheaper to return residues to the 
soil than to buy fertilizer.</p> 
<p><strong>Residues are a headache</strong>.&nbsp; The further the farmer is 
from the biorefinery or railroad, the slimmer the profit, and the less likely a 
farmer will want the extra headache and cost of hiring and scheduling many 
different harvesting, collection, baling, and transportation contractors for 
corn stover.</p> 
<p><strong>Residues are used by other industries</strong>. Farm managers 
working for distant owners are more likely to sell crop residues since 
they&rsquo;re paid to generate profits, not preserve land.&nbsp; But even they 
will sell to the highest bidder, which might be the livestock or dairy 
industries, furfural factories, hydromulching companies, biocomposite 
manufacturers, pulp mills, or city dwellers faced with skyrocketing utility 
bills, since the high heating value of residue has twice the energy of the 
converted ethanol.</p> 
<p><strong>Investors aren&rsquo;t stupid either</strong>. If farmers 
can&rsquo;t supply enough crop residues to fuel the large biorefinery in their 
region, who will put up the capital to build one?</p> 
<p><strong>Can the biomass be harvested, baled, stored, and transported 
economically?</strong></p> 
<p>Plants are closer to cotton candy than rocks. The oil to harvest, bale, 
deliver, clean, and store these straw pillows is likely to use more energy than 
the cellulosic fuels created.</p> 
<p><strong>Harvesting</strong>. &nbsp;Sixteen ton tractors harvest corn and 
spit out stover. &nbsp;Many of these harvesters are contracted and will 
continue to collect<em>corn</em> in the limited harvest time, not stover.&nbsp; 
If tractors are still available, the land isn&rsquo;t wet, snow doesn&rsquo;t 
fall, and the stover is dry, three additional tractor runs will mow, rake, and 
bale the stover (Wilhelm 2004).&nbsp; This will triple the compaction damage to 
the soil (Troeh 2005), create more erosion-prone tire tracks, increase CO2 
emissions, add to labor costs, and put unwanted foreign matter into the bale 
(soil, rocks, baling wire, etc).</p> 
<p>So biomass roadmaps call for a new type of tractor or attachment to harvest 
both corn and stover in one pass.&nbsp; But then the tractor would need to be 
much larger and heavier, which could cause decades-long or even permanent soil 
compaction.&nbsp; Farmers worry that mixing corn and stover might harm the 
quality of the grain.&nbsp; And on the cusp of energy descent, is it a good 
idea to build an even larger and more complex machine?</p> 
<p>If the stover is harvested, the soil is now vulnerable to erosion if it 
rains, because there&rsquo;s no vegetation to protect the soil from the impact 
of falling raindrops.&nbsp; Rain also compacts the surface of the soil so that 
less water can enter, forcing more to run off, increasing erosion. Water 
landing on dense vegetation soaks into the soil, increasing plant growth and 
recharging underground aquifers.&nbsp; The more stover left on the land, the 
better.</p> 
<p><strong>Baling</strong>. The current technology to harvest residues is to 
put them into bales of hay. Hay is a dangerous commodity &mdash; it can 
spontaneously combust, and once on fire, can&rsquo;t be extinguished, leading 
to fire loss and increased fire insurance costs.&nbsp; Somehow the bales have 
to be kept from combusting during the several months it takes to dry them from 
50 to 15 percent moisture.&nbsp; A large, well drained, covered area is needed 
to vent fumes and dissipate heat. If the bales get wet they will compost 
(Atchison 2004).</p> 
<p>Baling was developed for hay and has been adapted to corn stover with 
limited success.&nbsp; Biorefineries need at least half a million tons of 
biomass on hand to smooth supply bumps, much greater than any bale system has 
been designed for.&nbsp; Pelletization is not an option, it&rsquo;s too 
expensive.&nbsp; Other options need to be found. (DOE Feedstock Roadmap)</p> 
<p>To get around the problems of exploding hay bales, wet stover could be 
collected. The moisture content needs to be around 60 percent, which means a 
lot of water will be transported, adding significantly to the delivery cost.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong>. Stover needs to be stored with a moisture content 
of 15% or less, but it&rsquo;s typically 35-50%, and rain or snow during 
harvest will raise these levels even higher (DOE Feedstock Roadmap).&nbsp; If 
it&rsquo;s harvested wet anyhow, there&rsquo;ll be high or complete losses of 
biomass in storage (Atchison 2004).</p> 
<p>After catastrophic fires, the pulp industry learned to only use wet 
feedstock.&nbsp; If residues are stored wet, as in ensilage, a great deal of 
R&amp;D will be needed to see if there are disease, pest, emission, runoff, 
groundwater contamination, dust, mold, or odor control problems.&nbsp; The 
amount of water required is unknown. The transit time must be short, or aerobic 
microbial activity will damage it.&nbsp; At the storage site, the wet biomass 
must be immediately washed, shredded, and transported to a drainage pad under a 
roof for storage, instead of baled when drier and left at the farm.&nbsp; The 
wet residues are heavy, making transportation costlier than for dry residues, 
perhaps uneconomical. It can freeze in the winter making it hard to 
handle.&nbsp; If the moisture is too low, air gets in, making aerobic 
fermentation possible, resulting in molds and spoilage.</p> 
<p><strong>Delivery</strong>. The biorefinery must exist in an area of dense 
roads. Railroad delivery is ideal, but there are very few railroads which are 
already full of coal and other just-in-time products, or produce that might 
spoil if the train stopped and started often enough to pick up biomass (energy 
use of trains stopping &amp; starting is huge also). The outer distance for 
truck delivery can&rsquo;t be too far or the oil used makes it uneconomic.</p> 
<p>Although a 6,000 dry ton per day biorefinery would have 33% lower costs 
than a 2,000 ton factory, the price of gas and diesel limits the distance the 
biofuel refinery can be from farms, since the bales are large in volume but low 
in density, which limits how many bales can be loaded onto a truck and 
transported economically.</p> 
<p>So the &ldquo;economy of scale&rdquo; achieved by a very large refinery has 
to be reduced to a 2,000 dry ton per day biorefinery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even this 
smaller refinery would require 200 trucks per hour delivering biomass during 
harvest season (7 x 24), or 100 trucks per day if satellite sites for storage 
are used.&nbsp; This plant would need<strong>90%</strong> of the <strong>no-till
</strong> crop residues from the surrounding 7,000 square miles with <strong>
half</strong> the farmers participating. &nbsp;<em>Yet less than 20% of farmers 
practice no-till corn</em> and not all of the farmland is planted in corn. When 
this biomass is delivered to the biorefinery, it will take up at least 100 
acres of land stacked 25 feet high.</p> 
<p>The average stover haul to the biorefinery would be 43 miles one way if 
these rosy assumptions all came true (Perlack 2002).&nbsp;&nbsp; If less than 
30% of the stover is available, the average one-way trip becomes 100 miles and 
the biorefinery is economically impossible.</p> 
<p>There is also a shortage of truck drivers, the rail system can&rsquo;t 
handle any new capacity, and trains are designed to operate between hubs, not 
intermodally (truck to train to truck). The existing transportation system has 
not changed much in 30 years, yet this congested, inadequate infrastructure 
somehow has to be used to transport huge amounts of ethanol, biomass, and 
byproducts (Haney 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>In Summary: Plants are Hard to Make into Fuel</strong>s</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Not enough water for people, industry, and biofuel refineries now. By 
2100, the U.S. Census projects potentially 1.1 billion people in the United 
States.</li> 
<li>Plants have low density. They&rsquo;re like big mattresses when you bunch 
them up into bales.&nbsp; If you try to compact them further by turning them 
into pellets, it takes so much energy that you&rsquo;re entering negative 
energy land.</li> 
<li>Truck transportation is expensive compared to pipelines. You can&rsquo;t 
stuff plant mattresses into a pipe &ndash; you have to load them onto 
oil-burning trucks, nor can you load them up with as many as you&rsquo;d like, 
because they take up a lot of space.</li> 
<li>Plants grow diffusely across the landscape &mdash; a biorefinery needs 
plants delivered from the surrounding 7,000 or more square miles for a 2,000 
ton/day refinery.</li> 
<li>Every processing step takes energy. Plants must be planted, harvested, 
delivered, stored, milled, liquefied, heated, saccharified, fermented, 
evaporated, centrifuged, distilled, scrubbed, dried, stored, and transported to 
customers.</li> 
<li>Biorefineries need to be enormous for economies of scale &ndash;100 acres 
of hay stacked 25 feet high.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t do this at home &ndash; biofuels need to be pure or 
combustion engine life may be shortened, and used within 3 months before 
microbes chew them up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the gasohol made in the 1980&prime;s 
had so much water in it that gasohol got a bad name, that&rsquo;s why 
it&rsquo;s called ethanol in it&rsquo;s new reincarnation.</li> 
<li>Plants are hard to store. They rot and turn into mulch or can catch on 
fire.&nbsp; If stored wet, that adds to transportation costs and water use at 
the storage site.</li> </ul> 
<p>As a systems architect and engineer, I looked at projects from start to 
end, trying to identify the failure points.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Department of 
Energy Biomass Roadmaps and the Energy Biosciences Institute Proposal have 
taken a similar approach and identified the barriers to cellulosic fuels.</p> 
<p><strong>All of the steps from A to Z must succeed or a project fails
</strong>.&nbsp; Just solving the cellulosic issues within the biorefinery 
won&rsquo;t do any good if the other steps fail.&nbsp; There are major 
challenges in harvesting, storing, transporting biomass, and delivering 
cellulosic fuels to customers.</p> 
<p><strong>In business you&rsquo;re limited by money, in science, you&rsquo;re 
limited by the laws of physics and thermodynamics</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>When it comes to biofuels, you&rsquo;re also limited by <em>
ecosystems</em></strong>.&nbsp; To grow plants sustainably, the soil ecosystem 
and water supply need to be taken into account.</p> 
<p>The government and business entities don&rsquo;t appear to be looking at 
the entire process from start to end, or there&rsquo;d be no government 
subsidies to the ethanol industry or investment in commercial-level ethanol 
plants.</p> 
<p><strong>Cellulosic Biorefineries (see Appendix for more barriers)</strong>
</p> 
<p>Synthetic biologists are trying to make oil rather than ethanol for many 
reasons. There are billions of combustion engines that can only burn oil, which 
is<em>free</em> concentrated sunshine brewed by Mother Nature over hundreds of 
millions of years. Only uranium packs more punch per unit weight. The 98 tons 
of fossil plants per gallon is equal to 40 acres of wheat.</p> 
<p>Oil is easily poured, stored, and transported, combusts without problems 
rather than exploding. Basically, if you were trying to create an ideal energy, 
you&rsquo;d invent oil.</p> 
<p>But with every step required to transform a substance into energy, there is 
less energy yield.&nbsp; If a microbe can be created which digests cellulose 
and excretes oil, the number of steps can be reduced.</p> 
<p>But plants have evolved for millions of years to prevent themselves from 
being eaten. It will be hard to pull off.&nbsp; In termites, multiple microbe 
species are involved in breaking down lignocellulose, each consumes the wastes 
of others, which are toxic to the creature generating them.&nbsp; Keeping 
predators out of the vats, getting rid of contaminants, replicating enzymes and 
too many other issues to list make it unlikely cellulosic fuels can be made in 
the near future with a positive net energy.</p> 
<p>There are over 60 barriers to be overcome in making cellulosic ethanol in 
Section III of the DOE &ldquo;Roadmap for Agriculture Biomass Feedstock Supply 
in the United States&rdquo; (DOE Feedstock Roadmap 2003).&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Enzyme Biochemistry</strong>. Enzymes that exhibit high 
thermostability and substantial resistance to sugar end-product inhibition will 
be essential to fully realize enzyme-based sugar platform technology. The 
ability to develop such enzymes and consequently very low cost enzymatic 
hydrolysis technology requires increasing our understanding of the fundamental 
mechanisms underlying the biochemistry of enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis, 
including the impact of biomass structure on enzymatic cellulose 
decrystallization. Additional efforts aimed at understanding the role of 
cellulases and their interaction not only with cellulose but also the process 
environment is needed to affect further reductions in cellulase cost through 
improved production&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>No wonder many of the issues with cellulosic biofuels aren&rsquo;t 
discussed &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way to express the problems in a sound bite.
</p> 
<p>It may not be possible to reduce the complex cellulose digesting strategies 
of bacteria and fungi into microorganisms or enzymes that can convert cellulose 
into fuel in giant steel vats, especially given the huge physical and chemical 
variations in feedstock. The field of metagenomics is trying to create a 
chimera from snips of genetic material of cellulose-digesting bacteria and 
fungi.&nbsp; That would be the ultimate Swiss Army-knife microbe, able to 
convert cellulose to sugar and then sugar to ethanol or oil (i.e. butanol).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also research to replicate termite gut cellulose breakdown. 
Termites depend on fascinating creatures calledprotists in their guts to digest 
wood.&nbsp; The protists in turn outsource the work to multiple kinds of 
bacteria living inside of them. This is done with energy (ATP) and architecture 
(membranes) in a system that evolved over millions of years.&nbsp; If the 
termite could fire the protists and work directly with the bacteria, that 
probably would have happened 50 million years ago. This process involves many 
kinds of bacteria, waste products, and other complexities that may not be 
reducible to an enzyme or a bacteria.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jay Keasling, Director of Physical Biosciences at LBNL, proposes to do the 
above in a synthetic biology factory.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d order up the biological 
bits you need to create a microbial machine the way electronics parts are 
obtained at Fry&rsquo;s electronics stores. At U.C. Berkeley on April 21, 2007, 
he said this could also be used to get past the 15% concentration of ethanol 
that pickles micro-organisms, which results in a tremendous amount of energy 
being used to get the remaining 85% of water out.&nbsp; Or you could use this 
technology to create a creature that could convert miscanthus and switchgrass 
to create biofuels that can be put in pipelines and burned in diesel engines 
(Singer 2007).</p> 
<p>Biologists roll their eyes when reductionist physicists pat them on the 
head and tell little ol&rsquo; biology not to worry, living organisms can be 
reduced to atoms and enzymes, just&nbsp; take a piece of algae here, a bit of 
fungi or bacteria there and voila &ndash; a new creature that produces vast 
volumes of biofuels quickly.&nbsp; &nbsp;But biology is a messy wonderment. 
Creatures exist within food webs and don&rsquo;t reproduce well if surrounded 
by their own toxic wastes.&nbsp; The research is well worth doing, but public 
policy shouldn&rsquo;t assume synthetic biology is a &ldquo;slam dunk&rdquo;.
</p> 
<p>But meanwhile we&rsquo;re stuck with corn and ethanol, which in the end 
must be delivered to the customer. Since ethanol can&rsquo;t be delivered 
cheaply through pipelines, but must be transported by truck, rail, or barge 
(Yacobucci 2003), this is very expensive for the coastal regions.&nbsp; Alaska 
and Hawaii have managed to get out of having to add ethanol to gasoline, but 
California&rsquo;s Senator Feinstein has not been able to do the same.</p> 
<p>The whole cellulosic ethanol enterprise falls apart if the energy returned 
is less than the energy invested or even<strong><em>one</em></strong> of the 
major stumbling blocks can&rsquo;t be overcome. If there isn&rsquo;t enough 
biomass, if the residues can&rsquo;t be stored without exploding or composting, 
if the oil to transport low-density residues to biorefineries or deliver the 
final product is too great, if no cheap enzymes or microbes are found to break 
down lignocellulose in wildly varying feedstocks, if the energy to clean up 
toxic byproducts is too expensive, or if organisms capable of tolerating high 
ethanol concentrations aren&rsquo;t found, if the barriers in Appendix A 
can&rsquo;t be overcome, then cellulosic fuels are not going to happen.</p> 
<p>If the obstacles can be overcome, but we lose topsoil, deplete aquifers, 
poison the land, air, and water, what kind of Pyrrhic victory is that?</p> 
<p>Scientists have been trying to solve these issues for over thirty years now.
</p> 
<p><strong>Nevertheless, this is worthy of research money, but not public 
funds for commercial refineries until the issues above have been solved</strong>
.&nbsp; This is the best hope we have for replacing the half million products 
made from and with fossil fuels, and for liquid transportation fuels when 
population falls to pre-coal levels.</p> 
<p><strong>Part 7.&nbsp; Where do we go from here?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Subsidies and Politics: Now, and for the Foreseeable Future, 
Ethanol Will Only be Made from Corn</strong></p> 
<p>Biofuels from biodiverse, tall grass prairie are far preferable to ethanol 
from corn and soy, but there are no commercial level cellulosic biorefineries 
&ndash; and we are a long way from being able to deliver cellulosic fuels to 
customers.&nbsp; Even if all of the barriers to cellulosic fuels could be 
achieved before oil shocks hit, they&rsquo;d bankrupt our soils so quickly that 
there&rsquo;d be no biomass to feed the maws of the biorefineries.</p> 
<p>How come there are over 116 ethanol plants with 79 under construction and 
200 more planned?&nbsp; Government subsidies and tax breaks.</p> 
<p>Federal and state ethanol subsidies add up to 79 cents per liter (McCain 
2003), with most of that going to agribusiness, not farmers. There is also a 
tax break of 5.3 cents per gallon for ethanol (Wall Street Journal 2002). An 
additional 51 cents per gallon goes mainly to the oil industry to get them to 
blend ethanol with gasoline.</p> 
<p>In addition to the $8.4 billion per year subsidies for corn and ethanol 
production, the consumer pays an additional amount for any product with corn in 
it (Pollan 20005), beef, milk, and eggs, because corn diverted to ethanol 
raises the price of corn for the livestock industry.</p> 
<p>California Senator Feinstein calls ethanol a transfer of wealth to the 
Midwest, where 99% of ethanol is made. She points out it can&rsquo;t be shipped 
through gasoline pipelines, only by truck, boat, or rail, which is extremely 
expensive to transport from the Midwest to California. She notes that any 
shortfall in supply or manipulation could drive prices even higher (Feinstein 
2003, Washington Post 2002).</p> 
<p>Coming to a theater near you:&nbsp; Enron Part 2.</p> 
<p>The subsidies may never end, because Iowa plays a leading role in 
who&rsquo;s selected to be the next president. John McCain has backed off on 
his criticism of ethanol now that he&rsquo;s running for president (Birger 
2006).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Once we have a corn-based technology up and running the political 
system will protect it,&rdquo; said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a board member at 
the Energy Policy Research Foundation. &ldquo;We cannot afford to have 15 
billion gallons of corn-based ethanol in 2015, and that&rsquo;s exactly where 
we are headed&rdquo; (Barrionuevo 2007).</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop the ethanol subsidies and see if this elephant can fly on 
its own.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>President Carter asked us to put our sweaters on, and had plans for a soft 
landing, but Americans chose Reagans&rsquo; &ldquo;Morning in America&rdquo; 
and having our military do whatever was necessary to maintain the 
&ldquo;non-negotiable&rdquo; American way of life.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;re in for 
a much harder landing.</p> 
<p>Soil is the bedrock of civilization (Perlin 1991, Ponting 1993).&nbsp; 
Biofuels are not sustainable or renewable. Why would we destroy our topsoil, 
increase global warming, deplete and pollute groundwater, destroy fisheries, 
and use more energy than what&rsquo;s gained to make ethanol?&nbsp; Why would 
we do this to our children and grandchildren?</p> 
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a combination of pork barrel politics, an uninformed 
public, short-sighted greedy agribusiness corporations, jobs for the Midwest, 
politicians getting too large a percent of their campaign money from 
agribusiness (Lavelle 2007), elected leaders without science degrees, and 
desperation to provide liquid transportation fuels (Bucknell 1981, Hirsch 2005).
</p> 
<p>But this madness puts our national security at risk.&nbsp; Destruction of 
topsoil and collateral damage to water, fisheries, and food production will 
result in less food to eat or sell for petroleum and natural gas 
imports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diversion of precious dwindling energy and money to 
impossible solutions is a threat to our nations&rsquo; future.&nbsp; &nbsp;In 
an oil-less future, prime farm land is a nation&rsquo;s number one resource.</p>
<p>We are upset at mountain tops being blasted off to produce coal, and the 
damage done by mining for metal, yet mining footprints pale in comparison with 
the hundreds of millions of acres being mined to grow food.&nbsp; Regardless of 
the energy crisis, agriculture needs reforming.</p> 
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s use the limited energy we have left to fix what&rsquo;s 
wrong with agriculture</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Fix the unsustainable and destructive aspects of industrial 
agriculture</strong>. At least some good would come out of the ethanol fiasco 
if more attention were paid to how we grow our food.&nbsp; The effects of soil 
erosion on crop production have been hidden by mechanization and intensive use 
of fossil fuel fertilizers and chemicals on crops bred to tolerate them.&nbsp; 
As energy declines, crop yields will decline as well.</p> 
<p>States can play an important role. California is putting the brakes on coal 
with Global Warming bill AB32.&nbsp; This bill should also try to force needed 
agricultural reforms by buying only sustainable biofuels from biodiverse 
grassland crops to protect our soils and water, plus put more carbon into the 
ground.</p> 
<p><strong>Jobs</strong>.&nbsp; Since part of what&rsquo;s driving the ethanol 
insanity is job creation, divert the subsidies and pork barrel money to erosion 
control and sustainable agriculture.&nbsp; Maybe Iowa will emerge from its 
makeover looking like Provence, France, and volunteers won&rsquo;t be needed to 
hand out free coffee at rest areas along I-80.</p> 
<p><strong>Continue to fund cellulosic ethanol research</strong>, focusing on 
how to make 500,000 fossil-fuel-based products (i.e. medicine, chemicals, 
plastics, etc) and fuel for when population declines to pre-fossil fuel 
carrying capacity.&nbsp; The feedstock should be from a perennial, tall-grass 
prairie herbivore ecosystem, not food crops. But don&rsquo;t waste taxpayer 
money to build demonstration or commercial plants until most of the research 
and sustainability barriers have been solved.</p> 
<p><strong>Take away the E85 loophole</strong> that allows Detroit automakers 
to ignore CAFE standards and get away with selling even more gas guzzling 
vehicles (Consumer Reports 2006). &nbsp;&nbsp;Raise the CAFE standards higher 
immediately.&nbsp; Pass laws to favor low-emission vehicle sales and require 
all new cars to have energy efficient tires.</p> 
<p><strong>There are better, easier ways to stretch out petroleum than adding 
ethanol to it</strong>. Just keeping tires inflated properly would save more 
energy than all the ethanol produced today.&nbsp; Reducing the maximum speed 
limit to 55,consumer driving tips, truck stop electrification, and many other 
measures can save far more fuel in a shorter time than biofuels ever will, far 
less destructively.&nbsp; Better yet, Americans can bike or walk, which will 
save energy used in the health care system.</p> 
<p><strong>Reform our non-sustainable agricultural system</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Give integrated pest management and organic agriculture research more 
funding</li> 
<li>The National Resources Conservation Service (NCRS) and other conservation 
agencies have done a superb job of lowering the erosion rate since the dustbowl 
of the 1930&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Give these agencies a larger budget to further the 
effort.</li> 
<li>We need to make sure that the budget given to the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service in the 2007 Farm Bill isn&rsquo;t diverted to corn and 
ethanol subsidies.&nbsp; The farm bill should have a much larger budget for 
conservation of land and water.</li> 
<li><strong>To promote land stewardship, change taxes and zoning laws to favor 
small family farms</strong>.&nbsp; This will make possible the &ldquo;social, 
economic, and environmental diversity necessary for agricultural and ecosystem 
stability&rdquo; (Opie 2000).</li> 
<li>Make the land grant universities follow the directive of the Hatch Act of 
1887 to improve the lives of family farmers. Stop funding agricultural 
mechanization and petrochemical research and start funding how to fight pests 
and disease with diverse crops, crop rotations, and so on (Hightower 1978).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t allow construction of homes and businesses on crop land.</li> 
<li>Integrate livestock into the crop rotation.</li> 
<li>Teach family farmers and suburban homeowners how to maximize food 
production in limited space with Rodale andBiointensive techniques.</li> 
<li>Since less than 1 percent of our elected leaders and their staff have 
scientific backgrounds, educate them in systems ecology, population ecology, 
soil, and climate science.&nbsp; So many of the important issues that face us 
need scientific understanding and judgment.</li> 
<li>Divert funding from new airports, roads, and other future senseless 
infrastructure towards research in solar, wind, and cellulosic products. 
We&rsquo;re at the peak of scientific knowledge and our economic system 
hasn&rsquo;t been knocked flat yet by energy shortages &ndash; if we 
don&rsquo;t do the research now, it may never happen.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;And vote with your fork &ndash; buy local, organic food.</li> 
<li>Above all, we need to elect leaders who understand the gravity of the 
situation and have planned for what to do when oil shocks hit.</li> </ul> 
<p>There are many institutions and people who have been working on these 
issues for decades. What we need is a grass roots movement to enact reforms 
while we still have plentiful energy.</p> 
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to expect farmers to conserve the soil, 
since the fate of civilization lies in their hands.</strong>&nbsp;But we need 
to pay farmers for far more than the cost of growing food so they can afford to 
conserve the land.&nbsp; In an oil-less future, healthy topsoil will be our 
most important resource.</p> 
<p><strong>If we do nothing, dustbowls will return</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Erosion and other ecological damage is insidious, it doesn&rsquo;t happen 
overnight. We should try to manage our soils to last at least two thousand 
years. There&rsquo;s no excuse not to &ndash; we know how to do this.</p> 
<p><strong>Responsible politicians need to tell Americans why their love 
affair with the car can&rsquo;t continue.</strong>&nbsp; Leaders need to make 
the public understand that there are limits to growth, and an increasing 
population leads to the &ldquo;Tragedy of the Commons&rdquo;.&nbsp; Even if it 
means they won&rsquo;t be re-elected.&nbsp; Arguing this amidst the church of 
development that prevails is like walking into a Bible-belt church and telling 
the congregation God doesn&rsquo;t exist, but it must be done.</p> 
<p><strong>We are betting the farm on making cellulosic fuels work at a time 
when our energy and financial resources are diminishing</strong>.&nbsp; No 
matter how desperately we want to believe that human ingenuity will invent 
liquid or combustible fuels despite the laws of thermodynamics and how 
ecological systems actually work, the possibility of failure needs to be 
contemplated.</p> 
<p><strong>Living in the moment might be enlightenment for individuals, but 
for a nation, it&rsquo;s disastrous</strong>. Is there a Plan B if biofuels 
don&rsquo;t work?&nbsp;<strong>Coal is not an option</strong>. &nbsp;CO2 levels 
over 1,000 ppm could lead to the<strong>extinction</strong> of 95% of life on 
the planet (Lynas 2007, Ward 2006, Benton 2003).</p> 
<p>Here we are, on the cusp of energy descent, with <strong>mechanized 
petrochemical</strong> farms. &nbsp;<strong>We import more farm products now 
than we sell abroad</strong>(Rohter 2004). Suburban sprawl destroys millions of 
acres of prime farm land as population grows every year.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve gone 
from 7 million family farms to 2 million much larger farms and destroyed a 
deeply satisfying rural way of life.</p> 
<p>More people will need to go back to the land during energy descent, so 
let&rsquo;s start now, and encourage small family farms.</p> 
<p><strong>There need to be plans for de-mechanization of the farm economy if 
liquid fuels aren&rsquo;t found</strong>. &nbsp;There are less than four 
million horses, donkeys, and mules in America today.&nbsp; According to 
Bucknell, if the farm economy were de-mechanized, you&rsquo;d need at least 31 
million farm workers and 61 million horses (Bucknell 1981).</p> 
<p>We need to start on &ldquo;Plan B&rdquo; now in case biofuels aren&rsquo;t 
invented before oil shocks strike.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want to experience the 
same discontinuities as Cuba (Oxfam 2001) and North Korea (Williams 2000) did.
</p> 
<p>The population of the United States has grown over 25 percent since 
Bucknell published<em>Energy and the National Defense</em>.&nbsp; To 
de-mechanize now, we&rsquo;d need 39 million farm workers and 76 million 
horses. The horsepower represented by just farm tractors alone is equal to 400 
million horses.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time to start increasing horse and oxen 
numbers, which will leave even less biomass for biorefineries.</p> 
<p>If we wait, the consequences will be Stalinesque.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t 
just do this overnight, and with the ownership of land concentrated in so few 
hands, you&rsquo;re automatically heading towards feudalism rather than the 
Jeffersonian ideal our nation was founded on.</p> 
<p><strong>We need to transition from petroleum power to muscle power 
gracefully if we want to preserve democracy</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Roberts 
wonders whether the coming change will be &ldquo;peaceful and orderly or 
chaotic and violent because we waited too long to begin planning for it&rdquo; 
(Roberts 2004).</p> 
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re facing Peak Oil, Peak Natural Gas, Peak Coal, and 
climate change.&nbsp; As we go down the energy ladder and go up the 
thermometer, what is the likely carrying capacity of the</strong><strong>United 
States</strong><strong>? </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it 100 million (Pimentel 1991) 
or 250 million (Smil 2000)? &nbsp;Whatever carrying capacity is decided upon, 
pass legislation to drastically lower immigration and encourage one child 
families until America reaches this number.&nbsp; Or we can let resource wars, 
hunger, disease, extreme weather, rising oceans, and social chaos legislate the 
outcome.</p> 
<p><strong>Do you want to eat or drive?</strong> Even without growing food for 
biofuels, crop production per capita is going to go down as population keeps 
increasing, fossil fuel energy decreases, topsoil loss continues, and aquifers 
deplete, especially the Ogallala (Opie 2000).&nbsp; Where will the money come 
from to buy imported oil and natural gas if we don&rsquo;t have food to export?
</p> 
<p><strong>There is no such thing as &ldquo;waste&rdquo; biomass</strong>
.&nbsp; As we go down the energy ladder, plants will increasingly be needed to 
stabilize climate, provide food, medicine, shelter, furniture, heat, light, 
cooking fuel, clothing, etc.</p> 
<p><strong>Biofuels are a threat to the long-term national security of our 
nation</strong>.&nbsp; Is Dr. Strangelove in charge, with a plan to solve 
defense worries by creating a country that&rsquo;s such a salty polluted 
desert, no one would want to invade us?&nbsp; Why is Dr. Strangelove spending 
the last bits of energy in Uncle Sam&rsquo;s pocket on moonshine?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Perhaps he&rsquo;s thinking that we&rsquo;re all going to need it, and the way 
things are going, he&rsquo;s probably right.</p> 
<p><strong>Appendix<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Department of Energy Biofuel Roadmap Barriers</strong></p> 
<p>This is a <strong><em>partial</em></strong> summary of biofuel barriers 
from Department of Energy. Unless otherwise footnoted, the problems with 
biomass fuel production are from the<em>Multi Year Program Plan DOE Biomass Plan
</em> or <em>Roadmap for Agriculture Biomass Feedstock Supply in the United 
States</em>. (DOE Biomass Plan, DOE Feedstock Roadmap).</p> 
<p><strong>Resource and Sustainability Barriers</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass feedstock will ultimately be 
limited by finite amounts of land and water</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass production may not be sustainable 
because of impacts on soil compaction, erosion, carbon, and nutrition.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is it clear that perennial energy 
crops are sustainable, since not enough is known about their water and 
fertilizer needs, harvesting impacts on the soil, etc.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farmers are concerned about the long-term 
effects on soil, crop productivity, and the return on investment when 
collecting residues.</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effects of biomass feedstock 
production on water flows and water quality are unknown</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The risks of impact on biodiversity and 
public lands haven&rsquo;t been assessed.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Economic Barriers (or Investors Aren&rsquo;t Stupid)</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass can&rsquo;t compete economically 
with fossil fuels in transportation, chemicals, or electrical generation.</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There aren&rsquo;t any credible data on 
price, location, quality and quantity of biomass.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genetically-modified energy crops worry 
investors because they may create risks to native populations of related 
species and affect the value of the grain.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass is inherently more expensive than 
fossil fuel refineries because</p> 
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass is of such low density that it 
can&rsquo;t be transported over large distances economically.&nbsp; Yet 
analysis has shown that biorefineries need to be large to be economically 
attractive &ndash; it will be difficult to find enough biomass close to the 
refinery to be delivered economically.</p> 
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass feedstock amounts are 
unpredictable since unknown quantities will be lost to extreme weather, sold to 
non-biofuel businesses, rot or combust in storage, or by used by farmers to 
improve their soil.</p> 
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethanol can&rsquo;t be delivered in 
pipelines due to likely water contamination.&nbsp; Delivery by truck, barge, 
and rail is more expensive.&nbsp; Ethanol is a hazardous commodity which adds 
to its transportation cost and handling.</p> 
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass varies so widely in physical and 
chemical composition, size, shape, moisture levels, and density that it&rsquo;s 
difficult and expensive to supply, store, and process.</p> 
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capital and operating costs are high 
to bale, stack, palletize, and transport residues</p> 
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass is more geographically 
dispersed, and in much more ecologically sensitive areas than fossil resources.
</p> 
<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The synthesis gas produced has potentially 
higher levels of tars and particulates than fossil fuels.</p> 
<p>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biomass plants can&rsquo;t benefit from 
the same large-scale cost savings of oil refineries because biomass is too 
dispersed and of low density.</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers won&rsquo;t buy ethanol because 
it costs more than gasoline and contains 34% less energy per gallon. Consumer 
reports wrote they got the lowest fuel mileage in recent years from ethanol due 
to its low energy content compared to gasoline, effectively making ethanol 
$3.99 per gallon.&nbsp; Worse yet, automakers are getting fuel-economy credits 
for every E85 burning vehicle they sell, which lowers the overall mileage of 
auto fleets, which increases the amount of oil used and lessens energy 
independence.&nbsp; (Consumer Reports)</p> 
<p><strong>Equipment and Storage Barriers</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no harvesting machines to 
harvest the wide range of residue from different crops, or to selectively 
harvest components of corn stover.</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current biomass harvesting and collection 
methods can&rsquo;t handle the many millions of tons of biomass that need to be 
collected.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to store huge amounts of dry biomass 
hasn&rsquo;t been figured out.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knows how to store and handle vast 
quantities of different kinds of wet biomass.&nbsp; You can lose it all since 
it&rsquo;s prone to spoiling, rotting, and spontaneous combustion</p> 
<p><strong>Preprocessing Barriers</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t even know what the optimum 
properties of biomass to produce biofuels are, let alone have instruments to 
measure these unknown qualities.</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incoming biomass has impurities that have 
to be gotten out before grinding, compacting, and blending, or you may damage 
equipment and foul chemical and biological processes downstream.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harvest season for crops can be so short 
that it will be difficult to find the time to harvest cellulosic biomass and 
pre-process and store a year of feedstock stably.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cellulosic biomass needs to be pretreated 
so that it&rsquo;s easier for enzymes to break down.&nbsp; Biomass has evolved 
for hundreds of millions of years to avoid chemical and biological degradation. 
How to overcome this reluctance isn&rsquo;t well enough understood yet to 
design efficient and cost-effective pre-treatments.</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretreatment reactors are made of 
expensive materials to resist acid and alkalis at high temperatures for long 
periods. &nbsp;Cheaper reactors or low acid/alkali biomass is needed.</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create value added products, ways to 
biologically, chemically, and mechanically split components off (fractionate) 
need to be figured out.</p> 
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corn mash needs to be thoroughly 
sterilized before microorganisms are added, or a bad batch may ensue. Bad 
batches pollute waterways if improperly disposed of. (Patzek Dec 2006).</p> 
<p><strong>Cellulosic Ethanol Showstoppers</strong></p> 
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enzymes used in cellulosic biomass 
production are too expensive.</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An enzyme that breaks down cellulose must 
be found that isn&rsquo;t disabled by high heat or ethanol and other 
end-products, and other low cost enzymes for specific tasks in other processes 
are needed.</p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these enzymes are found, then cheap 
methods to remove the impurities generated are needed. Impurities like acids, 
phenols, alkalis, and salts inhibit fermentation and can poison chemical 
catalysts.</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catalysts for hydrogenation, 
hydrgenolysis, dehydration, upgrading pyrolysis oils, and oxidation steps are 
essential to succeeding in producing chemicals, materials, and transportation 
fuels. These catalysts must be cheap, long-lasting, work well in fouled 
environments, and be 90% selective.</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethanol production needs major 
improvements in finding robust organisms that utilize all sugars efficiently in 
impure environments.</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key to making the process economic are 
cheap, efficient fermentation organisms that can produce chemicals and 
materials. Wald writes that the bacteria scientists are trying to tame come 
from the guts of termites, and they&rsquo;re much harder to domesticate than 
yeast was.&nbsp; Nor have we yet convinced &ldquo;them to multiply inside the 
unfamiliar confines of a 2,000-gallon stainless-steel tank&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;control their activity in the industrial-scale quantities needed&rdquo; 
(Wald 2007).</p> 
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efficient aerobic fermentation organisms 
to lower capital fermentation costs.</p> 
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fermentation organisms that can make 95% 
pure fermentation products.</p> 
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheap ways of removing impurities 
generated in fermentation and other steps are essential since the costs now are 
far too high.</p>

<h2> Hydrogen </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>2008. Alice Friedemann. &ldquo;The Hydrogen Economy. Savior of Humanity or 
an Economic Black Hole?&rdquo; Skeptic Vol 14 No 1, 48-51.</p> 
<p>Skeptics scoff at perpetual motion, free energy, and cold fusion, but what 
about energy from hydrogen? Before we invest trillions of dollars in a hydrogen 
economy, we should examine the science and pseudoscience behind the hydrogen 
hype. Let&rsquo;s begin by taking a hydrogen car out for a spin.</p> 
<p>Although the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) in your car can burn 
hydrogen, the hope is that someday fuel cells, which are based on 
electrochemical processes rather than combustion (which converts heat to 
mechanical work), will become more efficient and less polluting than ICEs.1 
Fuel cells were invented before combustion engines in 1839 by William Grove. 
But the ICE won the race by using abundant and inexpensive gasoline, which is 
easy to transport and pour, and very high in energy content.2</p> 
<h4><strong>Production</strong></h4> 
<p>Unlike gasoline, hydrogen isn&rsquo;t an energy source &mdash; it&rsquo;s 
an energy carrier, like a battery. You have to make hydrogen and put energy 
into it, both of which take energy. Hydrogen has been used commercially for 
decades, so we already know how to do this. There are two main ways to make 
hydrogen: using natural gas as both the source and the energy to split hydrogen 
from the carbon in natural gas (CH4), or using water as the source and 
renewable energy to split the hydrogen from the oxygen in water (H2O).</p> 
<p>1) <em>Making Hydrogen from Fossil Fuels</em>. Currently, 96 percent of 
hydrogen is made from fossil fuels, mainly for oil refining and partially 
hydrogenated oil.3 In the United States, 90 percent is made from natural gas, 
with an efficiency of 72 percent,4 which means you lose 28 percent of the 
energy contained in the natural gas to make it (and that doesn&rsquo;t count 
the energy it took to extract and deliver the natural gas to the hydrogen 
plant).</p> 
<p>One of the main arguments made for switching to a &ldquo;hydrogen 
economy&rdquo; is to prevent global warming that has been attributed to the 
burning of fossil fuels. When hydrogen is made from natural gas, however, 
nitrogen oxides are released, which are 58 times more effective in trapping 
heat than carbon dioxide.5 Coal releases large amounts of CO2 and mercury. Oil 
is too powerful and useful to waste on hydrogen &mdash; it is concentrated 
sunshine brewed over hundreds of millions of years. A gallon of gas represents 
about 196,000 pounds of fossil plants, the amount in 40 acres of wheat.6</p> 
<p>Natural gas as a source for hydrogen is too valuable. It is used to create 
fertilizer (as both feedstock and energy source). This has led to a many-fold 
increase in crop production, allowing billions more people to be fed who 
otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be.7,8 We also don&rsquo;t have enough natural gas 
left to make a hydrogen economy happen from this source. Extraction of natural 
gas is declining in North America.9 It will take at least a decade to even 
begin replacing natural gas with imported liquid natural gas (LNG). Making LNG 
is so energy intensive that it would be economically and environmentally insane 
to use it as a source of hydrogen.10</p> 
<p>2) <em>Making Hydrogen from Water</em>. Only four percent of hydrogen is 
made from water via electrolysis. It is done when the hydrogen must be 
extremely pure. Since most electricity comes from fossil fuels in plants that 
are 30 percent efficient, and electrolysis is 70 percent efficient, you end up 
using four units of energy to create one unit of hydrogen energy: 70% * 30% = 
21% efficiency.11</p> 
<p>Producing hydrogen by using fossil fuels as a feedstock or an energy source 
defeats the purpose, since the whole point is to get away from fossil fuels. 
The goal is to use renewable energy to make hydrogen from water via 
electrolysis. When the wind is blowing, current wind turbines can perform at 
30&ndash;40 percent efficiency, producing hydrogen at an overall rate of 25 
percent efficiency &mdash; 3 units of wind energy to get 1 unit of hydrogen 
energy. The best solar cells available on a large scale have an efficiency of 
ten percent, or 9 units of energy to get 1 hydrogen unit of energy. If you use 
algae making hydrogen as a byproduct, the efficiency is about .1 percent.12 No 
matter how you look at it, producing hydrogen from water is an energy sink. If 
you want a more dramatic demonstration, please mail me ten dollars and 
I&rsquo;ll send you back a dollar.</p> 
<p>Hydrogen can be made from biomass, but there are numerous problems:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>it&rsquo;s very seasonal;</li> 
<li>it contains a lot of moisture, requiring energy to store and dry it before 
gasification;</li> 
<li>there are limited supplies;</li> 
<li>the quantities are not large or consistent enough for large-scale hydrogen 
production;</li> 
<li>a huge amount of land is required because even cultivated biomass in good 
soil has a low yield &mdash; 10 tons per 2.4 acres;</li> 
<li>the soil will be degraded from erosion and loss of fertility if stripped 
of biomass;</li> 
<li>any energy put into the land to grow the biomass, such as fertilizer and 
planting and harvesting, will add to the energy costs;</li> 
<li>the delivery costs to the central power plant must be added; and</li> 
<li>it is not suitable for pure hydrogen production.13</li> </ol> 
<h4><strong>Putting Energy into Hydrogen</strong></h4> 
<p>No matter how it&rsquo;s been made, hydrogen has no energy in it. It is the 
lowest energy dense fuel on earth.14 At room temperature and pressure, hydrogen 
takes up three thousand times more space than gasoline containing an equivalent 
amount of energy.15 To put energy into hydrogen, it must be compressed or 
liquefied. To compress hydrogen to the necessary 10,000 psi is a multi-stage 
process that costs an additional 15 percent of the energy contained in the 
hydrogen.</p> 
<p>If you liquefy it, you will be able to get more hydrogen energy into a 
smaller container, but you will lose 30&ndash;40 percent of the energy in the 
process. Handling it requires extreme precautions because it is so cold &mdash; 
minus 423 F. Fueling is typically done mechanically with a robot arm.16</p> 
<h4><strong>Storage</strong></h4> 
<p>For the storage and transportation of liquid hydrogen, you need a heavy 
cryogenic support system. The tank is cold enough to cause plugged valves and 
other problems. If you add insulation to prevent this, you will increase the 
weight of an already very heavy storage tank, adding additional costs to the 
system.17</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that a hydrogen car can go 55 miles per kg.18 A tank 
that can hold 3 kg of compressed gas will go 165 miles and weigh 400 kg (882 
lbs).19 Compare that with a Honda Accord fuel tank that weighs 11 kg (25 lbs), 
costs $100, and holds 17 gallons of gas. The overall weight is 73 kg (161 lbs, 
or 8 lbs per gallon). The driving range is 493 miles at 29 mpg. Here is how a 
hydrogen tank stacks up against a gas tank in a Honda Accord:</p> Amount of fuel
Tank weight with fuel Driving range Tank cost <br>
Hydrogen 55 kg @3000 psi 400 
kg 165 miles13 $200021 <br>
Gasoline 17 gallons 73 kg 493 miles $100 <br>
<br>

<p>According to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration (NHTSA), 
&ldquo;Vehicle weight reduction is probably the most powerful technique for 
improving fuel economy. Each 10 percent reduction in weight improves the fuel 
economy of a new vehicle design by approximately eight percent.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The more you compress hydrogen, the smaller the tank can be. But as you 
increase the pressure, you also have to increase the thickness of the steel 
wall, and hence the weight of the tank. Cost increases with pressure. At 2000 
psi, it is $400 per kg. At 8000 psi, it is $2100 per kg.20 And the tank will be 
huge &mdash; at 5000 psi, the tank could take up ten times the volume of a 
gasoline tank containing the same energy content.</p> 
<p>Fuel cells are heavy. According to Rosa Young, a physicist and vice 
president of advanced materials development at Energy Conversion Devices in 
Troy, Michigan: &ldquo;A metal hydride storage system that can hold 5 kg of 
hydrogen, including the alloy, container, and heat exchangers, would weigh 
approximately 300 kg (661 lbs), which would lower the fuel efficiency of the 
vehicle.&rdquo;21</p> 
<p>Fuel cells are also expensive. In 2003, they cost $1 million or more. At 
this stage, they have low reliability, need a much less expensive catalyst than 
platinum, can clog and lose power if there are impurities in the hydrogen, 
don&rsquo;t last more than 1000 hours, have yet to achieve a driving range of 
more than 100 miles, and can&rsquo;t compete with electric hybrids like the 
Toyota Prius, which is already more energy efficient and low in CO2 generation 
than projected fuel cells.22</p> 
<p>Hydrogen is the Houdini of elements. As soon as you&rsquo;ve gotten it into 
a container, it wants to get out, and since it is the lightest of all gases, it 
takes a lot of effort to keep it from escaping. Storage devices need a complex 
set of seals, gaskets, and valves. Liquid hydrogen tanks for vehicles boil off 
at 3&ndash;4 percent per day.23</p> 
<p>Hydrogen also tends to make metal brittle.24 Embrittled metal can create 
leaks. In a pipeline, it can cause cracking or fissuring, which can result in 
potentially catastrophic failure.25 Making metal strong enough to withstand 
hydrogen adds weight and cost. Leaks also become more likely as the pressure 
grows higher. It can leak from un-welded connections, fuel lines, and non-metal 
seals such as gaskets, O-rings, pipe thread compounds, and packings. A 
heavy-duty fuel cell engine may have thousands of seals.26 Hydrogen has the 
lowest ignition point of any fuel, 20 times less than gasoline. So if 
there&rsquo;s a leak, it can be ignited by any number of sources.27 Worse, 
leaks are invisible &mdash; sometimes the only way to know there&rsquo;s a leak 
is poor performance.</p> 
<h4><strong>Transport</strong></h4> 
<p>Canister trucks ($250,000 each) can carry enough fuel for 60 cars.28 These 
trucks weigh 40,000 kg, but deliver only 400 kg of hydrogen. For a delivery 
distance of 150 miles, the delivery energy used is nearly 20 percent of the 
usable energy in the hydrogen delivered. At 300 miles, that is 40 percent. The 
same size truck carrying gasoline delivers 10,000 gallons of fuel, enough to 
fill about 800 cars.29</p> 
<p>Another alternative is pipelines. The average cost of a natural gas 
pipeline is one million dollars per mile, and we have 200,000 miles of natural 
gas pipeline, which we can&rsquo;t re-use because they are composed of metal 
that would become brittle and leak, as well as the incorrect diameter to 
maximize hydrogen throughput. If we were to build a similar infrastructure to 
deliver hydrogen it would cost $200 billion. The major operating cost of 
hydrogen pipelines is compressor power and maintenance.30 Compressors in the 
pipeline keep the gas moving, using hydrogen energy to push the gas forward. 
After 620 miles, 8 percent of the hydrogen has been used to move it through the 
pipeline.31</p> 
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4> 
<p>At some point along the chain of making, putting energy in, storing, and 
delivering the hydrogen, we will have used more energy than we can get back, 
and this doesn&rsquo;t count the energy used to make fuel cells, storage tanks, 
delivery systems, and vehicles.32 When fusion can make cheap hydrogen, when 
reliable long-lasting nanotube fuel cells exist, and when light-weight 
leak-proof carbon-fiber polymer-lined storage tanks and pipelines can be made 
inexpensively, then we can consider building the hydrogen economy 
infrastructure. Until then, it&rsquo;s vaporware. All of these technical 
obstacles must be overcome for any of this to happen.33 Meanwhile, the United 
States government should stop funding the Freedom CAR program, which gives 
millions of tax dollars to the big three automakers to work on hydrogen fuel 
cells. Instead, automakers ought to be required to raise the average overall 
mileage their vehicles get &mdash; the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
standard.34</p> 
<p>At some time in the future the price of oil and natural gas will increase 
significantly due to geological depletion and political crises in extracting 
countries. Since the hydrogen infrastructure will be built using the existing 
oil-based infrastructure (i.e. internal combustion engine vehicles, power 
plants and factories, plastics, etc.), the price of hydrogen will go up as well 
&mdash; it will never be cheaper than fossil fuels. As depletion continues, 
factories will be driven out of business by high fuel costs35,36,37 and the 
parts necessary to build the extremely complex storage tanks and fuel cells 
might become unavailable.</p> 
<p>The laws of physics mean the hydrogen economy will always be an energy 
sink. Hydrogen&rsquo;s properties require you to spend more energy than you can 
earn, because in order to do so you must overcome waters&rsquo; hydrogen-oxygen 
bond, move heavy cars, prevent leaks and brittle metals, and transport hydrogen 
to the destination. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if all of these problems are 
solved, or how much money is spent. You will use more energy to create, store, 
and transport hydrogen than you will ever get out of it.</p> 
<p>Any diversion of declining fossil fuels to a hydrogen economy subtracts 
that energy from other possible uses, such as planting, harvesting, delivering, 
and cooking food, heating homes, and other essential activities. According to 
Joseph Romm, a Department of Energy official who oversaw research on hydrogen 
and transportation fuel cell research during the Clinton Administration: 
&ldquo;The energy and environmental problems facing the nation and the world, 
especially global warming, are far too serious to risk making major policy 
mistakes that misallocate scarce resources.38</p>

<h2> Hydropower </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>1) Ultimately dams silt up, usually within 25 to 200 years, so hydro-power 
is not a renewable source of power.</p> 
<p>2) We&rsquo;ve already dammed up the best rivers. There are now more than 
45,000 dams around the world, affecting more than half &mdash; 172 out of 292 
&mdash; of the globe&rsquo;s large river systems.</p> 
<p>3) Damming prevents salmon and other fish migration.</p> 
<p>4) We&rsquo;ve built dams in more than half of the large river systems and 
have decreased the amount of sediment flowing to the world&rsquo;s coasts by 
nearly 20 percent. This is causing long-term harm to the world&rsquo;s river 
ecosystems and raising risks that many coastal areas &mdash; sometimes hundreds 
of miles from the dams &mdash; will be flooded soon because they are deprived 
of sediments that help offset soil erosion. The harmful effects of ebbing soil 
deposits will be accelerated by the rising sea levels caused by global warming, 
say the researchers. More than 37% of the world&rsquo;s population, or over 2.1 
billion people, live within 93 miles of a coast.</p> 
<p>5) Dams are reducing biodiversity</p> 
<p>6) Dams create habitats more easily invaded by invasive plants, fish, 
snails, insects, and animals</p> 
<p>7) dams can increase ghg as impounded water gets choked with rotting

<h2> Nuclear Power </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>There are many reasons nuclear power is not even a partial solution to the 
energy crisis.</p> 
<p><strong>They&rsquo;re too expensive</strong></p> 
<p>This excellent article by Joe Romm &ldquo;The Nukes of Hazard: One Year 
After Fukushima, Nuclear Power Remains Too Costly To Be A Major Climate Solution
&rdquo; explains in great detail with good quality sources why nuclear power is 
too expensive a solution now or ever.&nbsp; And he is not anti-nuclear at all, 
he sees nuclear as playing a role, but not a large role given how expensive it 
is.</p> 
<p>Some of the points from this article about costs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>New nuclear reactors are phenomenally expensive, costing up to $10 billion 
dollars apiece.</li> 
<li>New reactors are intrinsically expensive because they must be able to 
withstand virtually any risk that we can imagine, including human error and 
major disasters</li> 
<li>Based on&nbsp;a 2007 Keystone report, we&rsquo;d need to add an average of 
17 plants each year, while building an average of 9 plants a year to replace 
those that will be retired, for a total of one nuclear plant every two weeks 
for four decades &mdash; plus 10 Yucca Mountains to store the waste</li> 
<li>Before 2007, price estimates of $4000/kw for new U.S. nukes were common, 
but by October 2007 Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service report, &ldquo;New Nuclear 
Generation in the United States,&rdquo; concluded, &ldquo;Moody&rsquo;s 
believes the all-in cost of a nuclear generating facility could come in at 
between $5,000 &ndash; $6,000/kw.&rdquo;</li> 
<li>That same month, Florida Power and Light, &ldquo;a leader in nuclear power 
generation,&rdquo; presented its detailed cost estimate for new nukes to the 
Florida Public Service Commission. It concluded that two units totaling 2,200 
megawatts would cost from $5,500 to $8,100 per kilowatt &ndash; $12 billion to 
$18 billion total!</li> 
<li>In 2008, Progress Energy informed state regulators that the twin 
1,100-megawatt plants it intended to build in Florida would cost $14 billion, 
which &ldquo;triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year 
ago.&rdquo; That would be more than $6,400 a kilowatt.&nbsp; (And that 
didn&rsquo;t even count the 200-mile $3 billion transmission system utility 
needs, which would bring the price up to a staggering $7,700 a kilowatt).</li> 
</ul> 
<h4><strong>Financial</strong></h4> 
<p>Nuclear plants require huge grid systems, since they&rsquo;re far from 
energy consumers. The Financial Times estimates that would require ten thousand 
billion dollars be invested world-wide in electric power systems over the next 
30 years.</p> 
<p>Investors aren&rsquo;t going to invest in new reactors because:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>of the billions in liability after a meltdown or accident</li> 
<li>there may only be enough uranium left to power existing plants</li> 
<li>the cost per plant ties up capital too long (it can take 10 billion 
dollars over 10 years to build a nuclear power plant)</li> 
<li>the costs of decommissioning are very high</li> 
<li>properly dealing with waste is expensive</li> </ul> 
<p>Nor will the USA government pay for the nuclear reactors given that public 
opinion is against that &mdash; 72% said no (in E&amp;E news), they 
weren&rsquo;t willing for the government to pay for nuclear power reactors 
through billions of dollars in new federal loan guarantees for new reactors.</p>
<p>Cembalest, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote &ldquo;In some ways, 
nuclear&rsquo;s goose was cooked by 1992, when the cost of building a 1 GW 
plant rose by a factor of 5 (in real terms) from 1972&Prime; (Cembalest).</p> 
<p><strong>There may not be enough uranium to power more than existing plants, 
if even that</strong></p> 
<p>Source: Colorado Geological survey</p> 
<p><strong>A crisis will harden public opinion against building new Nuclear 
Power Plants</strong></p> 
<p>Even Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb, thought NPP were dangerous 
and should be put underground for safety in case of a failure and to make 
clean-up easier.</p> 
<p>Green Peace International commissioned the 128 page report &ldquo;Nuclear 
Reactor Hazards&ldquo;.&nbsp; In it, they make a good case that it&rsquo;s only 
a matter of time before one of our aging reactors melts down.&nbsp; When that 
happens, the public will fight the development of more nuclear power 
plants.&nbsp; Other factors besides aging that could cause a disaster are 
natural disasters, failure of the electric grid, increased and more severe 
flooding, drought, and weather from climate change, lack of staffing as older 
workers retire and there are few educated engineers available to replace them 
&mdash; let alone build new power plants, and as terrorism and war increase 
from global shortages of just about everything.</p> 
<p>Five of the six reactors at the Fukushima plant in Japan were Mark 1 
reactors. Thirty-five years ago, Dale G. Bridenbaugh and two of his colleagues 
at General Electric quit after they became convinced that the Mark 1 nuclear 
reactor design they were reviewing was so flawed it could lead to a devastating 
accident (Mosk).</p> 
<p>Nuclear power plants are extremely attractive targets for terrorists and in 
a war.&nbsp; Uranium is not only stored in the core, but the 
&ldquo;waste&rdquo; area near the plant, providing plenty of material for 
&ldquo;dirty&rdquo; or explosive atom bombs.</p> 
<p>For details, read the original document or my summary of the Greenpeace 
report.</p> 
<h4>Energy</h4> 
<p>It&rsquo;s the wrong kind of energy, we don&rsquo;t need electricity, we 
need oil to run the 99% of our transportation that depends on it.</p> 
<p>The energy to build, decommission, dispose of wastes, etc., may be more 
than the plant will ever generate (negative EROEI).</p> 
<p>Scale</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To produce enough nuclear power to equal the power we currently get 
from fossil fuels, you would have to build 10,000 of the largest possible 
nuclear power plants. That&rsquo;s a huge, probably nonviable initiative, and 
at that burn rate, our known reserves of uranium would last only for 10 or 20 
years.&rdquo; (Goodstein).</p> 
<p>The range of estimated uranium reserves left ranges widely, varying from 30 
to 500 years. But as the concentration of uranium in ore declines (since the 
best ore is used first), while at the same time the energy to mine, transport, 
and concentrate the ore is declining, the higher estimates appear to be 
unlikely.</p> 
<p>Staffing</p> 
<p>Nuclear power has been unpopular for such a long time, that there 
aren&rsquo;t enough nuclear engineers, plant operators and designers, or 
manufacturing companies to scale up quickly (Torres 2006).</p> 
<p>Water issues</p> 
<p>Nuclear plants must be built near water for cooling. Scientists believe one 
of the likely outcomes of global warming is a rising sea level. About half of 
existing power plants are vulnerable to this and will need to be 
decommissioned. If we wait too long, floods damaging the electric grid could 
lead to a catastrophe by swamping both the electric grid and nuclear power 
plant backup systems, and eventually flood the nuclear power plant itself.</p> 
<p>NIMBYism</p> 
<p>Never underestimate NIMBYism, which is already preventing nuclear power 
plants from being built. The political opposition to building thousands of 
nuclear plants will be impossible to overcome.</p> 
<p>Enough sites for 10,000 Plants?</p> 
<p>Are there enough sites to build 10,000 new nuclear plants (near water)? If 
sea levels are rising, does that lessen the possible building sites even more?
</p> 
<p>No good way to store the energy</p> 
<p>One of the most critical needs for power is a way to store it. Large 
storage batteries of any kind &ndash; for storage or for transportation &mdash; 
have not been invented despite decades of research.</p> 
<p>A great deal of the electric power generated would need to be used to 
replace the billions of combustion engine machines and vehicles rather than 
providing heat, cooling, cooking power and light to homes and offices. It takes 
decades to move from one source of power to another. It&rsquo;s hard to see how 
this could be accomplished without great hardship and social chaos, which would 
slow the conversion process down. Desperation is likely to lead to stealing of 
key components of the new infrastructure to sell for scrap metal, as is already 
happening in Baltimore where 30-foot tall street lights are being stolen 
(Gately 2005).</p> 
<p><strong>Breeder reactors</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>We&rsquo;ve known since 1969 that we needed to build breeder reactors to 
stretch the lifetime of radioactive material to tens of thousands of years, and 
to reduce the radioactive wastes generated, but we still don&rsquo;t know how 
to do this. (NAS)</li> 
<li>If we ever do succeed, these reactors are much closer to being bombs than 
conventional reactors &ndash; the effects of an accident would be catastrophic 
economically and in the number of lives lost if it failed near a city (Wolfson).
</li> 
<li>The by-product of the breeder reaction is plutonium. Plutonium 239 has a 
half-life of 24,000 years. How can we guarantee that no terrorist or dictator 
will ever use this material to build a nuclear or dirty bomb during this time 
period?</li> </ul> 
<p>Greenpeace has a critique of nuclear power called <em>Nuclear Reactor 
Hazards</em> (2005) which makes the following points:</p> 
<p>1) As nuclear power plants age, components become embrittled, corroded, and 
eroded. This can happen at a microscopic level which is only detected when a 
pipe bursts. As a plant ages, the odds of severe incidents increase. Although 
some components can be replaced, failures in the reactor pressure vessel would 
lead to a catastrophic release of radioactive material. The risk of a nuclear 
accident grows significantly each year after 20 years. The average age of power 
plants now, world-wide, is 21 years.</p> 
<p>2) In a power blackout, if the emergency backup generators don&rsquo;t kick 
in, there is the risk of a meltdown. This happened recently in Sweden at the
Fosmark power station in 2006. A former director said &ldquo;It was pure luck 
that there was not a meltdown. Since the electricity supply from the network 
didn&rsquo;t work as it should have, it could have been a catastrophe.&rdquo; 
Another few hours and a meltdown could have occurred. It should not surprise 
anyone that power blackouts will become increasingly common and long-lasting as 
energy declines.</p> 
<p>3) 3rd generation nuclear plants are pigs wearing lipstick &ndash; 
they&rsquo;re just gussied up 2nd generation &mdash; no safer than existing 
plants.</p> 
<p>4) Many failures are due to human error, and that will always be the case, 
no matter how well future plants are designed.</p> 
<p>5) Nuclear power plants are attractive targets for terrorists now and 
future resource wars. There are dozens of ways to attack nuclear and 
reprocessing plants. They are targets not only for the huge number of deaths 
they would cause, but as a source of plutonium to make nuclear bombs. It only 
takes a few kilograms to make a weapon, and just a few micrograms to cause 
cancer.</p> 
<p>If Greenpeace is right about risks increasing after 20 years, then 
there&rsquo;s bound to be a meltdown incident within ten years, which would 
make it almost impossible to raise capital.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s already hard to raise capital, because the owners want to be 
completely exempt from the costs of nuclear meltdowns and other accidents. 
That&rsquo;s why no new plants have been built in the United States for decades.
</p> 
<p>The Energy Returned on Energy Invested may be too low for investors as 
well. When you consider the energy required to build a nuclear power plant, 
which needs tremendous amount of cement, steel pipes, and other infrastructure, 
it could take a long time for the returned energy to pay back the energy 
invested. The construction of 1970&rsquo;s U.S. nuclear power plants required 
40 metric tons of steel and 190 cubic meters of concrete per average megawatt 
of electricity generating capacity (Peterson 2003).</p> 
<p>The costs of treating nuclear waste have skyrocketed. An immensely 
expensive treatment plant to cleanup the Hanford nuclear plant went from 
costing 4.3 billion in 2000 to 12.2 billion dollars today. If the final 
treatment plant is ever built, it will be twelve stories high and four football 
fields long (Dininny 2006).</p>

<h2> Methane Hydrates </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These are a crystalline form of methane gas and pure water that exists 
where pressures are sufficiently high, or temperatures sufficiently low.</p> 
<p>1) They&rsquo;re at depth in oceans, so they&rsquo;re hard to get to. If 
you get them and bring them to the surface, they expand 164 times, which makes 
it hard to store and transport them. You&rsquo;ll need to use energy to 
compress them into a high enough density to do work</p> 
<p>2) Bringing them to the surface will release carbon dioxide, increasing 
global warming.</p> 
<p>3) Drilling in the geologically unstable areas where methane hydrates are 
found could trigger landslides, which could damage underwater pipelines and 
cables.</p> 
<p>4) We don&rsquo;t know how to get them in significant quantities yet, and 
the problems of doing so may be insurmountable</p> 
<p>5) They are not concentrated in reservoirs like oil. They&rsquo;re 
dispersed in thick layers at considerable depths. That would make them very 
ecologically destructive to mine, since you&rsquo;d have to cover such a large 
area of the ocean floor to get them, sifting through millions of cubic yards of 
silt to get a few chunks of hydrate.</p> 
<p>6) One of the hypotheses for extinctions in the past, such as the Permian, 
which killed 95% of life on the planet, is that a massive release of methane 
hydrates occurred. Even if we don&rsquo;t mine them for energy, it&rsquo;s 
possible that global warming will release them again as the permafrost melts in 
polar regions.</p> 
<p>7) Since methane hydrates form at low temperatures, you could try to mine 
them by raising the temperature. You don&rsquo;t need to raise the temperature 
much, and it&rsquo;s easy enough to do this by drilling for geothermal heat. 
The problem is, it&rsquo;s very hard to distribute the heat into the gas 
hydrate layer. You could also play with pressure and antifreeze to mine 
hydrates, but there are problems with these methods as well (Deffeyes. 2005. 
Beyond Oil, pp 74-76).</p>

<h2> Natural Gas </h2> Posted on July 10, 2011 by energyskeptic <br>
<br>

<p>Natural gas is the ideal electricity generating source:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>No sulfur or mercury like coal</li> 
<li>No particulates like diesel fuels</li> 
<li>Isn&rsquo;t radioactive like uranium</li> 
<li>It&rsquo;s always &ldquo;on&rdquo; unlike intermittent sources such as 
wind and solar</li> 
<li>Natural gas power plants are essential to the grid because they can be 
ramped up and throttled down quickly to keep electric load constant &mdash; as 
renewable energy such as wind and solar are added, &ldquo;peaker&rdquo; natural 
gas plants must also be added to balance the unreliable and unpredictable 
alternative sources</li> </ul> 
<p>1) Currently it&rsquo;s used for about 25% of our energy (USA), mainly for 
electricity, heating, and cooking.</p> 
<p>2) But we don&rsquo;t have enough natural gas left to substitute for oil 
&ndash; natural gas production peaked about 1970 and has a much steeper 
depletion rate than oil. So even though President Obama recently said we have 
&ldquo;100 years of natural gas&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not clear that we can drill 
enough to keep up with the incredibly fast rate of depletion of the gas 
released by fracking.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Source: Colorado Geological Survey</p> 
<p>3) We could import natural gas in liquefied form (LNG), but that requires 
billions of dollars of large processing plants and special ocean-going tankers. 
All of the proposed new LNG facilities have been prevented by communities 
worried about the explosive potential of the LNG facilities and ships.</p> 
<p>4) Natural gas can&rsquo;t be used by most vehicles, though there are Fed 
Ex and other vehicle fleets running on natural gas currently. It can take up to 
8 hours to fill a tank up with gas &ndash; it needs to be forced in and 
pressurized to be dense enough to power a vehicle.</p> <br>
