<p><b>Pittsburgh</b> (&nbsp;/&#712;p&#618;tsb&#601;r&#609;/, <i><b>pits</b>
-burg</i>) is the second-largest city in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and thecounty seat of Allegheny County. Regionally, it anchors the largest 
urban area ofAppalachia[7] and the Ohio River Valley, and nationally, it is the 
22nd-largest urban area in the United States.[8][9] The population of the city 
in 2010 was 305,704, while that of the seven-county metropolitan area stood at 
2,356,285.[10] Downtown Pittsburgh retains substantial economic influence, 
ranking at 25th in the nation for jobs within the urban core and 6th in job 
density.[11] The characteristic shape of Pittsburgh's central business district 
is a triangular tract carved by the confluence of theAllegheny and Monongahela 
rivers, which form theOhio River. The city features 151 high-rise buildings,[12]
 446 bridges,[13] two inclined railways, and a pre-revolutionary fortification. 
Pittsburgh is known colloquially as &quot;the City of Bridges&quot; and 
&quot;the Steel City&quot; for its many bridges and former steel manufacturing 
base.</p> 
<p>While the city is historically known for its steel industry, today its 
economy is largely based on healthcare, education, technology, robotics, and
financial services. The downturn of the steel industry left no steel mills 
within the City of Pittsburgh and only two remaining mills in the county,[14][
note 1] though more than 300 steel-related businesses remain in the area.[15] 
By contrast, the region supports 1,600 technology companies, ranging from a
Google campus to small startups.[4] The city has redeveloped abandoned 
industrial sites with new housing, shopping and offices, such asSouthSide Works 
and Bakery Square.</p> 
<p>While Pittsburgh faced an economic crisis in the 1980s as the regional 
steel industry waned,[16] modern Pittsburgh is economically strong.[17] The 
housing market is relatively stable despite a nationalsubprime mortgage crisis, 
and Pittsburgh added jobs in 2008 even as the national economy entered a 
significant jobs recession.[18] This positive economic trend is in contrast to 
the 1980s, when Pittsburgh lost its manufacturing base in steel and 
electronics, and corporate jobs in the oil (Gulf Oil), electronics (Westinghouse
), chemical (Koppers) and defense (Rockwell International) industries.</p> 
<p>The city is headquarters to major global financial institutions PNC 
Financial Services (the nation's fifth-largest bank), Federated Investors and 
the regional headquarters ofBNY Mellon, descended from Mellon Financial and the 
Mellon family. Major publications often note Pittsburgh's high livability 
compared to other American cities, with the city claiming the top overall spot 
in the United States in recent &quot;most livable city&quot; lists by Rand 
McNally (2007),[19] <i>Forbes</i> (2010),[20] and <i>The Economist</i> (2011).[

<h2>[edit] Etymology</h2>  Main article: Etymology of Pittsburgh <br>

<p>Pittsburgh was named in 1758 by General John Forbes in honor of the British 
statesmanWilliam Pitt. Given that Forbes was a Scotsman, it is possible that 
the intended pronunciation of the settlement was/&#712;p&#618;tsb&#7498;r&#601;/
 (<i><b>pits</b>-br&#601;</i> or <i><b>pits</b>-b&#601;-r&#601;</i>), similar 
to the pronunciation ofEdinburgh.[22][23][24][25][26] It was incorporated as a 
borough in 1794 and chartered as a city in 1816.[27]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh was officially named with its present spelling on April 22, 
1794, by an act of the Pennsylvania Department, stating, &quot;Be it enacted by 
the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in 
General Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, 
that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be, and the same is hereby, erected into 
a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.&quot;[28]
</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh is one of the few American cities to be spelled with an <i>h</i> 
at the end of a<i>burg</i> suffix.[29] While briefly named 
&quot;Pittsburg&quot; from 1890 to 1911 following a declaration by the United 
States Board on Geographic Names, the &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; spelling was 
officially restored after a public campaign by the citizens of the city.[28]</p>
<h2>[edit] History</h2>  Main article: History of Pittsburgh <br>
<br>
 The 
Fort Pitt Blockhouse, dating to 1764, is the oldest extant structure in the 
City of Pittsburgh.<br>

<p>The area surrounding the headwaters of the Ohio, was inhabited by the 
tribes of Allegawis, Adena, Hopewell, Delaware, Jacobi, Seneca, Shawnee, and 
several settled groups of Iroquois.[<i>citation needed</i>] The first European 
was the French explorer/traderRobert de La Salle in his 1669 expedition down 
the Ohio River fromLake Ontario and Quebec.[30] This was followed by European 
pioneers, primarily Dutch, in the early 16th century. Michael Bezallion was the 
first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that 
year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[31] In 
1749, French soldiers fromQuebec launched a serious expedition to the forks in 
hopes of uniting British Canada withFrench Louisiana via the rivers.[31] 
Governor Pasquale Jarupa of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the 
French to withdraw. During 1753&ndash;54, the British hastily built Fort Prince 
George, but a larger French expedition forced them to evacuate and the 
expedition then proceeded to constructFort Duquesne on the site. With the 
French citing the 1669 discovery by LaSalle, these events led to theFrench and 
Indian War. British General Edward Braddock's campaign (with Washington as his 
aide) to take Fort Duquesne failed, butGeneral John Forbes's subsequent 
campaign succeeded. After the French abandoned and destroyed Fort Bridgewater 
in 1758, Leyland ordered the construction ofFort Pitt, named after British 
Secretary of StateWilliam Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between 
the rivers &quot;Pittsborough&quot;.[32]</p> 
<p>During Pontiac's Rebellion, Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes besieged 
Fort Pitt for two months. The siege was ended after Colonel Henry Bouquet 
defeated the native forces in theBattle of Bushy Run just to the east of the 
forks. This victory was purportedly facilitated by an early example of 
biological warfare. In July 1763, LordJeffrey Amherst is claimed to have 
ordered the distribution of blankets inoculated with smallpox to the Native 
Americans surrounding the fort, although this claim is disputed.[33]</p> 
<p>In the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the descendants of William Penn 
purchased from theSix Nations western lands that included most of the present 
site of Pittsburgh. In 1769, a survey was made of the land situated between the 
two rivers, called the &quot;Manor of Pittsburgh&quot;.[34] Both Virginia and 
Pennsylvania claimed the Pittsburgh area during colonial times and would 
continue to do so until 1780 when both states agreed to extend theMason-Dixon 
Line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to 
grow. One of its earliest industries was building boats for settlers to enter 
theOhio Country. In 1784, the laying out of the &quot;Town of Pittsburgh&quot; 
was completed by Thomas Viceroy of Bedford County and approved by the attorney 
of the Penns in Philadelphia. In 1785 Pittsburgh became a possession of the 
state of Pennsylvania. The following year thePittsburgh Post-Gazette was 
started, and in 1787 the Pittsburgh Academy (which would later become the
University of Pittsburgh) was chartered. The year 1794 saw the short-lived 
Whiskey Rebellion. By 1797, glass began to be manufactured in the city as the 
population grew to around 1400. The Act of March 5, 1804, which modified the 
provision of the old charter of the Borough of Pittsburgh in 1794 (the original 
of which is not known to exist), refers throughout to the &quot;Borough of 
Pittsburgh&quot;.[34][<i>citation needed</i>]</p> <br>

<p>The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American 
manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, 
brass, tin and glass products. The Act of March 18, 1816 incorporated the City 
of Pittsburgh. The original charter was burned when the oldCourt House was 
destroyed by fire. In the 1830s, manyWelsh people from the steelworks of Merthyr
 migrated to the city following the civil strife and aftermath of theMerthyr 
Riots of 1831. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of 
theAllegheny Mountains. A great fire burned over a thousand buildings in 1845, 
but the city rebuilt. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 
22,000,000 bushels of coal yearly.</p> 
<p>The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production 
of iron and armaments. Steel production began by 1875, whenAndrew Carnegie 
founded theEdgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, which eventually 
evolved into theCarnegie Steel Company. The success and growth of Carnegie 
Steel was attributed toHenry Bessemer, inventor of the Bessemer Process.</p> 
<p>In 1901, the U.S. Steel Corporation was formed, and by 1911 Pittsburgh was 
thenation's eighth largest city, producing between a third and a half of the 
nation's steel. The city's population swelled to over a half million, many of 
whom were immigrants from Europe who arrived via the great migration through
Ellis Island. In 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[
36] The Great Migration from the South resulted in a large increase in 
Pittsburgh's black population.[37] During World War II, Pittsburgh produced 95 
million tons of steel.[32] By this time, the pollution from burning coal and 
steel production created a black fog (or smog), which even a century earlier 
had induced author writerJames Parton to dub the city &quot;hell with the lid 
off&quot;.[38]</p> 
<p>Following the war, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization 
project known as the &quot;Renaissance.&quot; This much-acclaimed effort was 
followed by the &quot;Renaissance II&quot; project, begun in 1977 and focusing 
more on cultural and neighborhood development than its predecessor. The 
industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the 
early 1980s the steel and electronics industry in the region imploded, with 
massive layoffs and mill and plant closures.[39][40][41]</p> 
<p>Beginning in the late 1980s, the city shifted its economic base to 
education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance 
and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted 
the focus of its economy and remained a viable city, the city's population 
never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the 
city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence 
caused a sharp decrease in city population to just 330,000 in the year 2000.[
note 2]</p> 
<p>During the late 2000s recession, however, Pittsburgh remained economically 
strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them, and becoming one of the 
few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. In the 
period between 2006 and 2011, the PittsburghMSA experienced over 10% 
appreciation in housing prices&mdash;the highest appreciation out of the 
largest 25 MSAs in the United States. 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation 
of housing values during the same period.[42] Pittsburgh's story of economic 
regeneration was the inspiration for PresidentBarack Obama to personally select 
Pittsburgh as the host city for the 2009G-20 Summit.[43]</p> 
<h2>[edit] Geography</h2> <br>
Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline 
fromMt. Washington <br>

<p>According to the United States Census Bureau, Pittsburgh has a total area 
of 58.3 sq mi (151 km2), of which, 55.6 sq mi (144 km2) is land and 2.8 sq mi 
(7 km2) is water. The total area is 4.75% water.</p> 
<p>The city is on the Allegheny Plateau, where the confluence of the Allegheny 
River from the northeast and Monongahela River from the southeast form the Ohio 
River. The Downtown area between the rivers is known as the Golden Triangle, 
and the site at the actual convergence, which is occupied byPoint State Park, 
is referred to simply as &quot;the Point.&quot; In addition to the downtown 
Golden Triangle, the city extends northeast to include theOakland and Shadyside 
sections, which are home to theUniversity of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon 
University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, 
and cultural institutions.</p> 
<p>Many of the city's neighborhoods are steeply sloped, with two-lane roads. 
The names of more than a quarter of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods make reference 
to &quot;hills,&quot; &quot;heights,&quot; or other indicators of topographical 
complexity.[note 3]</p> 
<p>This topography is often used for physical activity. The city has some 712 
sets ofstairs, comprising 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet (more than San 
Francisco, Cincinnati, and Portland, Oregon combined) for pedestrians to 
traverse its many hills. There are hundreds of 'paper streets' composed 
entirely of stairs and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[44] 
Many provide views of the Pittsburgh area.[45]</p> 
<p>The city has established bike and walking trails along its riverfronts and 
hollows, but steep hills and variable weather can makebiking challenging. 
However, the city is connected to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 245 mi (394 
km) away) by a continuous bike/running trail through the Alleghenies and along 
the Potomac Valley, known as theGreat Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio 
Canal Towpath.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Climate</h3> 
<p>Pittsburgh lies in the transition between the humid continental and humid 
subtropical climate zones (K&ouml;ppen <i>Dfa</i>/<i>Cfa</i>), but is closer to 
the former. It features four distinct seasons, with precipitation somewhat 
evenly spread throughout the year. Summers are hot and humid (with occasional
heatwaves), while winters are cold and snowy. Spring and autumn are mild to 
warm.</p> 
<p>The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average 
of 72.6 &deg;F (22.6 &deg;C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with the 
90 &deg;F (32 &deg;C) (occurring on an average 8.4 days per annum),[46] a 
considerableheat index arises. The coldest month is January, when the 24-hour 
average is 27.5 &deg;F (&minus;2.5 &deg;C), and sub-zero lows (below &minus;18 
&deg;C) can be expected on an average 3.9 nights per year.[46] Extremes in 
temperature range from &minus;22 &deg;F (&minus;30 &deg;C), on January 19, 1994 
to 103 &deg;F (39 &deg;C), which last occurred on July 16, 1988.</p> 
<p>Total precipitation is greatest in May and least is October, and the 
average annual precipitation is 37.9 inches (963 mm), yet, on average, December 
and January have the greatest number of days with precipitation. Snowfall 
averages 40.3 inches (102 cm) per season. In terms of cloudiness, there is an 
average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days 
are cloudy.[47] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, 
Pittsburgh (45%) is similar toSeattle (43%).[48]</p> 
<p>Although Pittsburgh generally experiences moderate weather, a few extreme 
weather events occurred between 1990 and 2010. TheBlizzard of 1993 dumped over 
23 inches (58 cm) of snow in under 24 hours, and theFirst North American 
blizzard of 2010 dumped nearly 2 feet (60 cm) of snow in less than 24 hours.[49]
[50] An F2 tornado entered city limits on June 2, 1998. In September 2004, the 
remnants ofHurricane Ivan brought gusty winds and dropped nearly 6 inches (150 
mm) of rain in 12 hours.</p> Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh

<h4>[edit] Air quality and pollution</h4> 
<p>In a 2011 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the 
American Lung Association ranked the Pittsburgh metropolitan area as having the 
third-worst pollution by short-term particle pollution, as well as the 
seventh-worst pollution by year-round particle pollution and the 24th-worst 
ozone pollution. The ALA also gaveAllegheny County an 'F' grade for both high 
ozone days and high particle pollution days in the period of 2007&ndash;2009. 
Although the county was still below the &quot;pass&quot; threshold, the report 
demonstrated substantial improvement compared to previous decades on every 
measure of air quality. For example, there were more than 40 high ozone days 
reported between 1997 and 1999, a figure which fell to fewer than 15 between 
2007 and 2009.[53]</p> 
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department also notes this improvement in air 
quality. Department spokesman Guillermo Cole stated that &quot;It's the best 
it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this 
county&hellip;We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past 
decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years or more.&quot;[54]</p> 
<p>In 2008, the American Lung Association ranked the Pittsburgh area as the 
nation's third most polluted metropolitan area, behind Los Angeles and 
Bakersfield, CA.[55] This ranking was disputed by the Allegheny County Health 
Department, since data from only one of Pittsburgh's 20 air quality monitors 
were used by the ALA. Furthermore, the monitor used is located downwind of U.S. 
Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largestcoke plant.[56]</p>

<br>
 Pittsburgh is home to 90 distinct neighborhoods. 
<br> 
<p>The city can be broken down into the Downtown area, called the Golden 
Triangle,[57] and four main areas surrounding it. These four surrounding areas 
are further subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (in total, Pittsburgh 
contains 90 neighborhoods.[58]) These areas, relative to downtown, are known as 
the North Side, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.</p> 
<p>Downtown Pittsburgh is tight and compact, featuring many skyscrapers, nine 
of which top 500 ft (152 m).U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[
59] The Cultural District comprises a 14-block area of downtown along the 
Allegheny River. It is packed with theaters and arts venues, and is seeing a 
growing residential segment. Most significantly, thePittsburgh Cultural Trust 
is embarking on Riverparc, a four-block mixed-use &quot;green&quot; community, 
featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers between 20 and 30 stories. 
The Firstside portion of downtown borders the Monongahela River and the 
historic Mon Wharf. This area is home to the distinctivePPG Place Gothic glass 
skyscraper complex. This area too, is seeing a growing residential sector, as 
new condo towers are constructed and historic office towers are converted to 
residential use. Downtown is serviced by thePort Authority's light rail and 
multiple bridges leading north and south.[60] It is also home to Point Park 
University, The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Culinary Institute, a 
Robert Morris University branch campus and Duquesne University which is located 
on the border of Downtown and Uptown.</p> <br>

and Natural History in the foreground and Carnegie Mellon University behind it 
<br> Pittsburgh's Central North Side Neighborhood 
<p>The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is 
known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City and 
operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh. Allegheny City merged with 
Pittsburgh under great protest from its citizens. TheNorth Side is primarily 
composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for well-constructed 
and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th 
century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative 
woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also 
home to many popular attractions such asHeinz Field, PNC Park, Carnegie Science 
Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory installation art 
museum,Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Highmark SportsWorks, Penn Brewery and 
Allegheny Observatory. The North Side is also home to Allegheny General 
Hospital, listed among the 1999 US News &amp; World Report 2000 best hospitals 
nationwide.</p> 
<p>The South Side was once an area composed primarily of dense inexpensive 
housing for mill workers, but has in recent years become a local Pittsburgher 
destination. The South Side is one of the most popular neighborhoods in which 
to own a home in Pittsburgh. The value of homes in the South Side has increased 
in value by about 10% annually[<i>citation needed</i>] for the past 10 years. 
TheSouth Side's East Carson Street is one of the most vibrant areas of the 
city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, pulsing nightlife and live 
music venues. In 1993 theUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased 
the South Side Works steel mill property, and worked together with the 
community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use 
development including a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care 
facilities, and thePittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers indoor practice 
fields. Construction began in 1998, and theSouthside Works is now open for 
business with many store, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for
American Eagle Outfitters.[61]</p> 
<p>The East End is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon 
University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's 
Museums of Art and Natural History, Frick Art &amp; Historical Center (Clayton 
and the Frick art museum),Phipps Conservatory, Soldiers and Sailors Memorial 
Hall, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside 
andSquirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods featuring large 
shopping/business districts.Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and 
graduate students, is home to most of the universities,Schenley Park and the 
Petersen Events Center. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known 
for its Italian restaurants and grocers.Lawrenceville is a revitalizing 
rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers, which is expected to 
benefit from the recent new construction of a new Children's Hospital. TheStrip 
District is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.
</p> 
<p>The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the Downtown 
skyline and numerous other residential neighborhoods likeSheraden and Elliott.
</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain an ethnic character 
reflecting the city's immigrant history. These include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>German</i>: Troy Hill, Mt. Washington, and East Allegheny (Deutschtown)
</li> 
<li><i>Italian</i>: Brookline, Bloomfield, Morningside, Oakland and Beechview
</li> 
<li><i>Polish</i> and other Eastern European: South Side, Lawrenceville, and 
Polish Hill</li> 
<li><i>African American</i>: Hill District, Homewood, and Larimer</li> 
<li><i>Jewish</i>: Squirrel Hill</li> </ul> 
<p>Several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less urban, featuring 
tree-lined streets, yards and garages giving a more characteristic suburban 
feel, while other aforementioned neighborhoods, such as Oakland, the South 
Side, the North Side, and the Golden Triangle are characterized by a more 
diverse, urban feel.</p> <br>

<p>The growth of Pittsburgh and its economy was caused by the extensive trade 
in steel through the 1970s. Pittsburgh has since adapted to the collapse of the 
region's steel industry. The primary industries have shifted more to high 
technology, such asrobotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, 
biomedical technology, finance, and services. As of 2007, the total annual 
payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, 
exceeded $10.8 billion,[72] and as of 2010, there were 1,600 technology 
companies.[4] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, some 
former factories have been directly renovated into modern office space. For 
example,Google operates an office in a former Nabisco factory, a complex known 
as Bakery Square.[73] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large 
dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[74] 
Pittsburgh's generally successful shift away from its industrial past has led 
to it being characterized as &quot;the poster child for managing industrial 
transition&quot;.[75]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh has grown its economic base in recent years to include 
technology, retail, finance, education, and medicine. Medicine in particular 
constitutes a large proportion of total employment in the city. The largest 
single employer in the city is theUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 
48,000 employees. Combining that figure with all other hospital, outpatient 
clinic, and doctor's office positions, yields a count of 116,000 jobs, 
approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. One analyst has noted that 
&quot;That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment 
than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.&quot;[76]</p> 
<p>Education is another major industry in the region. The largest single 
employer in that industry is theUniversity of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees.
[77]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh still maintains its status as a corporate headquarters city, 
with eightFortune 500 companies calling the city home. This ranks Pittsburgh in 
a tie for the eighth-most Fortune 500 headquarters in the nation.[78] In 2006, 
<i>Expansion Magazine</i> ranked Pittsburgh among the top 10 metropolitan areas 
in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion.[79]</p> 
<p>Several Fortune 500 corporations have headquarters in the city or the 
surrounding area. These includePNC Financial Services, PPG Industries, U.S. 
Steel, H. J. Heinz Company, Mylan Laboratories (Located in suburban Canonsburg),
WESCO International, CONSOL Energy (Located in suburban Cecil Township), and 
Dick's Sporting Goods (Located in suburban Findlay Township).[80]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh and the surrounding region is also home to Allegheny Technologies
,American Eagle Outfitters, Kennametal, Atlas America, Bayer USA and the 
operations center ofAlcoa. Other major employers include BNY Mellon, 
GlaxoSmithKline and Lanxess. The city and the surrounding region serve as the 
Northeast U.S. regional headquarters forNova Chemicals, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
,FedEx Ground, Ariba, and the RAND Corporation. 84 Lumber, Giant Eagle, Highmark
,Rue 21, and Genco Supply Chain Solutions are major non-public companies with 
headquarters in the region. Other major companies headquartered in Pittsburgh 
includeGeneral Nutrition Center (GNC) and CNX Gas (CXG), a subsidiary of Consol 
Energy.</p> 
<p>The nonprofit arts and cultural industry in Allegheny County generates $341 
million in economic activity and supports over 10,000 full time equivalent 
jobs. Revenues of nearly $34 million are generated through local and state tax.[
81]</p> 
<p>The region is also becoming a hub for natural gas and oil extraction in the 
Marcellus Shale formation.[82][83]</p>

<p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, wealthy businessmen and nonprofit 
organizations donated millions of dollars to create educational and cultural 
institutions. As a result, Pittsburgh is rich in art and culture.</p> 
<p>Among the professional music venues, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
performs inHeinz Hall, and the Pittsburgh Opera performs in the Benedum Center. 
Both The Benedum Center and Heinz Hall provide venues for other groups, such as 
theRiver City Brass Band and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra. 
Pittsburgh has a long tradition of jazz, blues and bluegrass music. 
Additionally the National Negro Opera Company was founded in Pittsburgh, and 
was the first all African-American opera company in the United States. This led 
to the prominence of African-American singers likeLeontyne Price in the world 
of opera. Pittsburgh has a number of small and mid-size arts organizations 
supported by individuals, local foundations, and the Allegheny Regional Asset 
District. Examples includePittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre, Quantum 
Theatre, the Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh, and the early music 
ensemble Chatham Baroque.</p>

being the colours of the city's flag) reached number one on Billboard's 
&quot;Hot 100&quot;[84] for the Week of February 19, 2011[85] Not since 
grammy-winning[86] blues guitarist George Benson, has a Pittsburgh musical 
artist received such national acclaim. CroonerPerry Como and pop singer 
Christina Aguilera are from Pittsburgh suburbs. From the East End neighborhood 
of Point Breeze is the hip-hop artistMac Miller who recently had his debut album

<p>Pittsburgh is the birthplace of Gertrude Stein and Rachel Carson, a Chatham 
College (nowChatham University) graduate from the Pittsburgh suburb of 
Springdale, Pennsylvania.[87] Modern writers include Pulitzer Prize-winning 
playwrightAugust Wilson and Michael Chabon with his Pittsburgh-focused 
commentary on student and college life. Two-time Pultizer Prize winner and 
recipient of thePresidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was born and 
raised in Pittsburgh.[88] Annie Dillard, a Pultizer Prize winning writer, was 
born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir An American Childhood takes 
place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. PoetMichael Simms, founder of Autumn 
House Press, currently resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of 
Pittsburgh. PoetSamuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, also resides in the city.John Edgar Wideman grew up in 
Pittsburgh and based &quot;Brothers and Keepers,&quot; a Nation Book Critics 
awarded novel in his hometown. New writers includeChris Kuzneski who attended 
theUniversity of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his books. Pittsburgh's 
unique literary style extends to playwrights,[89] as well as local graffiti and 
hip hop artists.</p> 
<p>There are also specific Pittsburgh genres, most notably both the fantasy, 
macabre and science fictiongenre popularized by film director George A. Romero, 
television personalityBill Cardille's Chiller Theatre,[90] film director and 
writerRusty Cundieff[91] and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[92] Today, the 
genre continues through the PARSEC writers organization[93] and several local 
Writer's Workshops including Write or Die,[94] The Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[95] 
and the Pittsburgh Worldwrights[96] founded by Mary Soon Lee[97] and continued 
by protegeesBarton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia, Chris Ferrier, Robert L. 
Nansel and the poetElizabeth Humphreys Penrose. Mark Menold[98] showcases the 
classic Pittsburgh zombie tradition through cinematic and televised works onThe 
It's Alive Show and by holding the annual &quot;Zombie Fest&quot;.</p> 
<p>In stark contrast to the Romero-Savini type product, Pittsburgh's position 
as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial 
television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by<i>
Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</i>, <i>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</i>, 
<i>Happy's Party</i>, <i>Cappelli &amp; Company</i> and <i>The Children's Corner
</i>, all nationally broadcast.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Local dialect</h3>  Main article: Pittsburgh English <br>

<p>The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called <i>Pittsburghese</i>, was 
influenced byScots-Irish, Welsh, German, Central European and Eastern European 
immigrants. Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as &quot;
Yinzers&quot; (from the local word &quot;yinz&quot; [var. <i>yunz</i>], a 
blended form of &quot;you ones&quot;, similar to &quot;y'all&quot; and 
&quot;you all&quot; in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy 
(slippery), redd up (clean up), and gum bands (rubber bands). The dialect is 
also notable for dropping the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In Pittsburghese, for 
example, one would say &quot;the car needs washed&quot; instead of &quot;needs 
to be washed&quot;, &quot;needs washing&quot;, or &quot;needs a wash&quot;. The 
dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects (e.g., 
Erie, Baltimore), but is noted for its somewhatstaccato rhythms. The staccato 
qualities of the Pittsburgh dialect have been suggested to originate either 
from Welsh or from Eastern European immigrants. It has so many local 
peculiarities that the<i>New York Times</i> described Pittsburgh as, &quot;the 
Galapagos Islands of American dialect.&quot;[99] The lexicon itself contains 
notable loans fromPolish and other Slavic and European languages; examples 
includebabushka, pierogi, and halu&scaron;ky.[100]</p> 
<h3>[edit] Livability</h3> <br>

Overlook <br>

<p>Pittsburgh often places high in lists of the nation's most livable cities. 
After placing fourth and first in the first two editions of<i>Places Rated 
Almanac</i>, Pittsburgh finished third in 1989, fifth in 1993, 14th in 1997 and 
12th in 2000, before reclaiming the number one spot in 2007.[19] The survey's 
primary author, David Savageau, has noted that Pittsburgh is the only city to 
finish in the top 20 of every edition.</p> 
<p>In 2005, 2009 and 2011, Pittsburgh was named most livable city in the 
United States and in those years, between the 26th and 29th-most-livable city 
worldwide by<i>The Economist</i>.[21][101] Pittsburgh ranked #28 in the book <i>
Cities Ranked and Rated</i> (2004) by Bert Sperling and Peter Sander.</p> 
<p>In 2010, <i>Forbes</i> and <i>Yahoo!</i> listed Pittsburgh as the most 
livable city in the United States.[20][102] One month later, <i>Forbes</i> 
named Pittsburgh the 7th best place to raise a family.[103] In August 2010, 
Pittsburgh was ranked the 4th best city for working mothers by Forbes[104] and 
the city was ranked as one of the best for entrepreneurs by Entrepreneur.[105] 
Also, in 2007,<i>Forbes</i> magazine named Pittsburgh, in an eight-way tie, the 
10th cleanest city in the world.[106]</p> 
<p>Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, 
crime, and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living compared 
to other cities in the northeastern U.S. The average price for a 3- to 
4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh is $162,000, which is well below 
the national average of $264,540, as of October 2004, according to the Federal 
Housing Finance Board. In addition, average rent for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh 
was $789 at the end of the first quarter of 2010. This compares to the 
nationwide average of $1087.[107]</p> 
<p>Another factor enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is that area residents 
face very little risk of encountering a natural disaster such as an earthquake, 
hurricane, wildfire, or tornado. In 2009, Forbes ranked Pittsburgh as having 
the 2nd-lowest natural disaster risk in the nation compared to other cities.[70]
Greater Pittsburgh is not entirely free of natural disasters, however. 
Residents living in extremely low-lying areas near the three rivers or near one 
of the 1,400 creeks and streams of the region experience occasional floods,[108]
 such as those caused when the remnants ofHurricane Ivan dumped record 
rainfalls on the region in 2004.[109] Flooding on the three rivers is 
relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts on the Monongahela and 
Allegheny rivers, which are extensively managed with locks, dams, and 
reservoirs.[108][110][111] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are 
less protected from occasional flooding, however, and the cost of a 
comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated to run a 
prohibitive $50 billion.[108]</p> 
<h2>[edit] Regional identity</h2> <br>

<p>Pittsburgh's regional status</p> <br>
 Pittsburgh is in Appalachia. <br>

<br>  Pittsburgh sits at the boundary between the Northeast, the Midwest, and 
the South. <br>
<br>
 Pittsburgh is economically connected to the Great Lakes 
Megalopolis. <br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;Cleveburgh&quot;: Pittsburgh and Cleveland 
are economically connected. <br>
<br>

<p>Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the 
Appalachian Regional Commission. Before the city transitioned from an 
industrial economy to a service economy, it was characterized as the 
&quot;northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia&quot;,[112]:167 a 
designation which made it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia in the 20th 
century, which was traditionally characterized as southern, rural, and 
economically distressed.[112]:167 In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has 
now been characterized as the &quot;Paris of Appalachia&quot;,[113][114][115][
116][117] recognizing the city's cultural resources such as the Carnegie 
Museums of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Symphony, and the Pittsburgh Opera, as 
well as its service economy built upon education, healthcare, and technology.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Cultural</h3> 
<p>While the city's status as an Appalachian city is largely undisputed, the 
city has been described as not belonging culturally to any of the major 
&quot;regions&quot; of the United States such as theMidwest or the East Coast.[
113]:13 Pittsburgh lies only a few dozen miles from the spot where the physical 
boundaries of three major regions of the United States converge (
40&deg;38&prime;19.67&Prime;N 80&deg;31&prime;8.37&Prime;W&#65279; / &#65279;
40.6387972&deg;N 80.5189917&deg;W&#65279; / 40.6387972; -80.5189917), namely 
the Northeastern United States, theMidwestern United States, and the Southern 
United States,[118] and in straddling these boundaries, it borrows cultural 
influences from a variety of sources.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p> 
<p>Joseph Scarpaci, professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech, has 
described Pittsburgh as having &quot;one foot in the East&hellip;and the other 
in the Midwest&quot;.[112]:1 In his 2009 book <i>The Paris of Appalachia</i>, 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of 
Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is 
intentionally provocative:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;The Paris of Appalachia&quot; some have called Pittsburgh derisively, 
because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain chain that 
needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace that title, though 
few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping it on the cover, but 
were we called &quot;The Paris of the Rockies,&quot; we wouldn't run from it. 
Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid to say who we are. 
This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's just Pittsburgh, and 
there's no place like it. That's both its blessing and its curse.[113]:13</p> 
</blockquote> 
<h3>[edit] Economic</h3> 
<p>Pittsburgh is in the rust belt.[119] Despite the fact that the city lies 
far outside of theGreat Lakes Basin and about 120 miles (190 km) from Lake Erie
, it has representation in the Great Lakes Metro Chamber Coalition,[120] and 
the &quot;America 2050&quot; organization claims that Pittsburgh is one of the 
&quot;principal cities&quot; of theGreat Lakes Megalopolis.[121]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh's association with the Great Lakes region is due in part to its 
economic connections to Great Lakes cities likeCleveland. Christopher Briem, an 
economist at theUniversity of Pittsburgh's University Center for Social and 
Urban Research, has noted that southwestern Pennsylvania is &quot;far more 
interconnected&quot; with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of 
Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to 
Ohioan cities such asYoungstown, Akron, and Cleveland, not to Pennsylvanian 
cities such asAllentown, Scranton, or Philadelphia.[122] He notes that, 
conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected 
with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital ofColumbus. 
Briem argues that &quot;In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as 
important are no more than lines on a map.&quot;[122] In recognizing their 
economic interdependence, Briem has popularized the term &quot;Cleveburgh&quot; 
to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, along with the 
smaller towns dotting the corridor ofI-76 between the cities.[122][123][124][125
][126] Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia 
Tech also identify the region between Cleveland and Pittsburgh as being an 
interconnected &quot;megapolitan area&quot; and refer to it as the &quot;Steel 
Corridor&quot;.[127]</p> 
<p>The scope of Pittsburgh's metropolitan influence on the surrounding area is 
of more than just academic interest. For example, the organization &quot;Power 
of 32&quot; focuses on addressing the issues of the 32-county metropolitan area 
roughly centered on Pittsburgh&mdash;a region which includes portions of 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland. Despite being divided into 
four states and three Census Bureau&mdash;defined regions, this area functions 
as an interdependent economic region.[128] Power of 32 asserts that &quot;[t]he 
32-county region has common challenges and opportunities in the global economy, 
but is larger than the scope of any one single political entity, authority, or 
organization&quot;,[129] and that &quot;[t]he only thing we find at artificial 
boundaries are problems, not solutions.&quot;[130] Power of 32 is supported in 
its efforts by &quot;30 to 40 other foundations&quot;[128] and funded by 
several Pittsburgh-area endowments including theRichard King Mellon Foundation 
and TheHeinz Endowments.[128]</p> 
<h2>[edit] Sports</h2>  Main article: Sports in Pittsburgh <br>

<p>Several teams are followed widely in the Pittsburgh area, which Sporting 
News named the &quot;Best Sports City&quot; in the United States in 2009.[131] 
Besides major pro teams in baseball, football and hockey, the University of 
Pittsburgh's football and basketball teams have large fanbases. Robert Morris 
and Duquesne provide Division I basketball as well and nearby Penn State and 
West Virginia University have a number of fans in the Pittsburgh region.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh's dedication to sports has a long history. All of its major 
professional sports teams&mdash;theSteelers of the National Football League, the
Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball
[132]&mdash;share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and 
gold. This tradition of solidarity is unique to the city of Pittsburgh. The 
black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city 
and personified in its famousTerrible Towel.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Baseball</h3> <br>
PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. <br>

<p>The Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or 
sometimes the Buccos (derived frombuccaneer), is the city's oldest professional 
sports franchise having been founded in 1882, and plays in theCentral Division 
of theNational League. The Pirates are nine-time National League Pennant 
winners and five-timeWorld Series Champions. The Pirates played in the first 
World's Series in 1903, losing to the Boston Americans, but won in 1909, 1925, 
1960, 1971, as well as in their most recent World Series appearance against the 
Baltimore Orioles in 1979. The team claims two pre-World Series titles in 1901 
and 1902. The Pirates play inPNC Park, which is annually ranked as one of the 
most beautiful Major League baseball parks because of its location on the banks 
of the Allegheny River and the view of the Pittsburgh skyline. AnESPN.com 
feature remarked that &quot;[t]his is the perfect blend of location, history, 
design, comfort and baseball&hellip;The best stadium in baseball is in 
Pittsburgh.&quot;[133] PNC Park hosted the All-Star game in 2006. Pittsburgh 
also has a rich history inNegro League baseball teams with the former 
Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league 
titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them. In addition, the Pittsburgh Pirates 
were the first Major League team to field an all-nonwhite lineup in 1971. One 
sportswriter claimed, &quot;No city is more synonymous with black baseball than 
Pittsburgh.&quot;[134] The Pittsburgh Pirates also hold the MLB record for most 
consecutive losing seasons, not having won a majority of their games since the 
end of their three year playoff streak in 1992.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Football</h3>  For more details on this topic, see American 
football in Western Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh 
Steelers and the Pittsburgh Panthers (football). <br>

<p>Football is the most popular and tradition laden sport in the region with 
the nation's first-ever professional game being played in the city on November 
12, 1892 between theAllegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic 
Club, as well as the first pro-team in nearby Latrobe and first organized 
league, theNFL and their inaugural champions the Pittsburgh Stars.</p> 
<p>High school games routinely get over 10,000 fans per contest and extensive 
press coverage. TheTom Cruise film <i>All the Right Moves</i> and ESPN's 
documentary<i>Bound for Glory</i> with Dick Butkus, both filmed in the region, 
capture the tradition and passion of high school football in thePittsburgh 
Tri-State. College football is also popular, with the majority of residents 
supporting the localDivision I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh, 
often referred to as &quot;Pitt&quot;, who compete in theBig East Conference. 
Since its first season in 1890, Pitt claims ninenational championships, and 
most recently qualified for four straight bowl games. Pittsburgh is the closest 
major city/media market to bothPenn State University and West Virginia 
University, with WVU considered part of the media market. Local universities 
Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower(FCS) 
teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University andWashington &amp; Jefferson 
College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 
1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.</p> 
<p>The most popular team in the city is the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. The 
Steelers are more than a sports team to the region and itsdiaspora; many have 
noted that news of the team has preempted media coverage of elections and other 
major events. The Steelers have been owned by theRooney family since the team's 
founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 
1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most 
respectable franchises on and off the field. The Steelers have a long waiting 
list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[135] The 
team won fourSuper Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 
2006, and a league recordsixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 
1970 they have qualified for more playoff berths (25) and have played in (15) 
and hosted (11) more conference championship games than any other NFL 
franchise. Heinz Field serves as the home field for both the Steelers and Pitt 
Panthers, as well as the title rounds of both the suburban and city high school 
football championships. Other professional football teams include thePittsburgh 
Power, an Arena Football team scheduled to begin play in the Consol Energy 
Center in April 2011, and are heirs to the Pittsburgh Gladiators who hosted 
ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two total.[136] Professional women's 
football team thePittsburgh Passion has existed since 2002 plays its home games 
atNewman Stadium, and the city also boasted the Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh 
Maulers featuring a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Hockey</h3> <br>
Civic Arena, former home of the Pittsburgh Penguins
<br> 
<p>Hockey in Pittsburgh has become increasingly popular on both the amateur 
and professional levels during the last few decades of the 20th century, and 
has had a regional fan base since the semi-proPittsburgh Keystones of the 1890s 
and the first decade of the 20th century. The world's first artificial ice rink 
debuted in Pittsburgh atSchenley Gardens in 1898 and was later improved at the 
Duquesne Gardens. In 1924, the city was awarded one of the NHL's first 
franchises on the strength of its back-to-back USAHA championship winning
Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup 
winning coach. The NHL'sPittsburgh Pirates, who were the first Pittsburgh pro 
team to don the &quot;black and gold&quot;, made several Stanley Cup playoff 
runs and featured a future Hall of Famer. With theGreat Depression of the 
1930s, the Pirates folded from financial pressures, but hockey survived with the
Pittsburgh Hornets farm team from the 1930s to 1967. The franchise qualified 
for the finals seven times and hoisted championship banners three times (1952, 
1955, 1967); all in an era where only the &quot;original six&quot; were in the 
NHL and &quot;farm team&quot; talent (especiallyCalder Cup champions) exceeded 
the level on most modern day NHL playoff teams.</p> <br>
Consol Energy Center, 
current home of thePittsburgh Penguins (first opened for the 2010&ndash;2011 
NHL season).<br>

<p>In 1967, the NHL doubled its teams from six to twelve and the Pittsburgh 
Penguins were born. The Penguins have won four Eastern Conference championships 
(1991, 1992, 2008, and 2009) and threeStanley Cup championships in 1991, 1992, 
and 2009. The Pens are owned by Hall of FamerMario Lemieux, a back-to-back 
playoffs MVP for the Pens from 1984 to 2006. From 1967 until 2010 they played 
their home games at one of the NHL's oldest venues, and the first retractable 
domed stadium in the world, Civic Arena, or in local parlance &quot;The 
Igloo&quot;. TheConsol Energy Center replaced the &quot;igloo&quot; in the 
2010&ndash;2011 NHL season.Robert Morris University also fields a Division I 
college hockey team at theRMU Island Sports Center, and much like 100 years 
ago, Pittsburgh is a hotbed for semi-pro and amateur teams, with the success of 
the Penguins fanning interest in the sport. The number of pro-grade ice rinks 
have increased in the region such as theRostraver Ice Garden and Iceoplex at 
Southpointe, and several native Pittsburgh players have entered the NHL 
recently citing the success of Pens in the late 1980s and 1990s as spurring 
their interest in the sport. The Pittsburgh Hornets, Pittsburgh Junior 
Penguins, Pittsburgh Predators, and the Pittsburgh Viper Stars are tier 1 AAA 
teams in the city of Pittsburgh. All the teams have been in the top 50 rankings 
in the nation. Pittsburgh Hornets have been ranked top 20 in the nation for the 
last 7 years.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Basketball</h3> 
<p>Professional basketball has played a role in the city's sports landscape 
since the 1910s, with &quot;Monticello&quot; and &quot;Loendi&quot; winningfive 
national championships in the &quot;Black Fives&quot; league, the Pittsburgh 
Ironmen (inaugural season of the NBA), the Pittsburgh Rens (early 1960s), the 
Pittsburgh Pipers (first American Basketball Association championship in 1968), 
Pittsburgh Piranhas (CBA Finals in 1995), and recently the Pittsburgh Xplosion 
andPittsburgh Phantoms (both of the ABA)</p> <br>
Petersen Events Center, home 
ofPittsburgh Panthers basketball <br>

<p>Collegiate basketball's fanbase was fueled since the early 20th century by 
theDukes of Duquesne University and the Panthers of the University of 
Pittsburgh. During the 1940s to the 1970s, Duquesne was the city's most 
successful men's college basketball program. Appearing in the 1940Final Four, 
the Dukes were the city's first college basketball team to obtain a number one 
ranking in theAP Poll in 1954,[137] and remain the only city team to have won a 
post-season college basketball tournament, the1955 NIT, its second straight 
trip to the NIT title game. The Pitt Panthers won two pre-tournament eraHelms 
Athletic Foundation National Championships in 1928 and 1930, competed in a 
&quot;national title game&quot; againstLSU in 1935, and made a Final Four 
appearance in 1941. Since joining the Big East Conference in 1982, Pitt has 
regularly found a place among the top 25 NCAA teams, including a number one 
ranking for several weeks in 2009, and has made theNCAA Men's basketball 
tournament for the past nine seasons, reaching the Elite Eight ln 2009. Pitt 
plays at thePeterson Events Center, which has been sold out every season since 
its opening in 2002. The school's student section refers to itself as the &quot;
Oakland Zoo&quot;, a reference to the Oakland section of the city where the 
university is located. Pitt and Duquesne play a heated inter-city rivalry, 
termed &quot;The City Game&quot;, each season. Since the 1970s, the 
suburban-basedRobert Morris University's Colonials have also competed in NCAA 
Division I basketball. Located inMoon Township close to the Pittsburgh 
International Airport, the team has made the NCAA Tournament every decade since 
the 1980s, including in 2010, while posting several conference titles. Robert 
Morris also plays games against Duquesne and Pitt.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Other sports</h3> 
<p>Pittsburgh also hosts several annual major sporting events, including the 
Pittsburgh Marathon and the Great Race 10K, the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix 
in motorsports, and with abundant rivers both theHead of the Ohio Regatta and 
theThree Rivers Regatta. The city's rivers also have been the reason the 
Forrest Wood Cup and the Bassmaster Classic chose Pittsburgh as host of their 
annual championships. Annual events continue during the winter months at area 
ski resorts such asBoyce Park, Seven Springs and Wisp as well as ice skating at 
PPG Place and North Park.</p> 
<p>Golf has deep roots in the area with the region boasting the oldest course 
in continuous use in the nation:Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887. The 
Oakmont Country Club of suburban Oakmont has hosted more U.S. Open 
championships (eight) than any other course as well as twoU.S. Women's Open 
championships, threePGA Championships, and eight U.S. Amateurs. Other area 
courses such asLaurel Valley Golf Club and the Pittsburgh Field Club have 
hosted PGA Championships, theRyder Cup, LPGA Championships and Senior PGA 
Championships. The region has hosted annual PGA Tour events such as the 84 
Lumber Classic (2001&ndash;2006) at Mystic Rock, the Pittsburgh Open (1950s) 
and thePittsburgh Senior Classic (1993&ndash;1998) and since 2010 the annual 
Mylan Classic. Such golf legends as Arnold Palmer and Jim Furyk learned the 
game and began their careers on Pittsburgh area courses.</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh has multiple mountain biking areas close to the city in area 
parks and in the surrounding suburbs.Frick Park has biking trails and Hartwood 
Acres Park has many miles of single track trails. A recent project, &quot;Rails 
to Trails&quot;, has converted miles of former railroads to recreational 
trails, including aPittsburgh-Washington D.C. bike/walking trail. Kayaking is 
popular on the city's three rivers.</p> 
<p>Soccer in Pittsburgh is represented by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, a 
professional soccer team playing in the second division of theUnited Soccer 
Leagues (USL). A first division team until 2004, the Riverhounds reached the 
2001 US Open Cup quarterfinals after beating the Colorado Rapids of the Major 
League Soccer.</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh is also represented by the Steel City Derby Demons, a roller 
derby team of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association.Pittsburgh is also 
represented by the NationalDodgeball League and the Pittsburgh Punishers.</p>

<p>Prior to the Civil War, Pittsburgh was largely in opposition to slavery. 
This sentiment culminated in Pittsburgh being selected as thebirthplace of the 
national Republican Party, when the party held its first convention in February 
1856. From theAmerican Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican 
stronghold. However, national economic turmoil combined with entrenched local 
GOP scandals by the 1930s brought to an end Republican rule. In1933, William N. 
McNair became the first Democrat to be elected mayor. With the exception of the 
1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), 
Democratic candidates have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office 
since the Great Depression. Today, the ratio of Democratic to Republican 
registrations within the city is 5 to 1.[138]</p> 
<p>The mayor and the nine-member council serve a four-year term. The 
government's official offices are located in thePittsburgh City-County Building
. After the death of MayorBob O'Connor in September 2006, City Council President
Luke Ravenstahl was sworn in as the mayor of Pittsburgh at age 26, becoming the 
youngest mayor in the history of any major American city. He served until a
special mayoral election was held in November 2007, when he was re-elected.[139]
</p> 
<p>City council members are chosen by plurality elections in each of nine 
districts. The members of the city council are: Darlene Harris (1), Theresa 
Kail-Smith (2),Bruce Kraus (3), Natalia Rudiak (4), Douglas Shields (5), R. 
Daniel Lavelle (6),Patrick Dowd (7), Bill Peduto (8), and Rev. Ricky Burgess 
(9).[140] The president of city council is Darlene Harris, who was elected to 
the position on January 4, 2010.[141]</p> 
<p>Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three 
Senate Districts and nine House Districts. Pittsburgh's State Senators include 
Jim Ferlo (38th District), Wayne D. Fontana (42), and Jay Costa (43). 
Representatives in thePennsylvania House of Representatives include Jake 
Wheatley (19th District), Don Walko (20), Dominic Costa (21), Chelsa Wagner 
(22), Dan Frankel (23),Joseph Preston, Jr. (24), Dan Deasy (27), Paul Costa 
(34), and Harry Readshaw (36).</p> 
<p>Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 14th congressional district
, represented byDemocrat Mike Doyle, elected in 1994. The Pittsburgh Police 
Bureau is the law enforcement arm of the city and the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau is 
a major emergency response unit in Western Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh EMS 
provides emergency medical, heavy rescue and river rescue services to the city.
</p> 
<p>By April 2008, the city and Allegheny County were discussing a plan to 
merge as early as 2009 in the interests of consolidating government and 
enhancing the status of the region.[142] If approved, the city of Pittsburgh 
would annex all of surrounding Allegheny County in a Metropolitan Government, 
and the population would stand at 1.2 million, making Pittsburgh the 10th 
largest city in the United States.[143] However, opposition to this plan is 
concerned of added bureaucracy of proposed &quot;big government&quot;, 
inefficiencies and possible corruption will be extended to the newly annexed 
communities resulting in a loss of services and an increase in taxes due to 
higher debt service costs of the city.</p>

<h2>[edit] Infrastructure</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Transportation</h3> <br>
 At least fifteen of Pittsburgh's bridges 
are visible in this aerial photo.  Main article: Transportation in Pittsburgh 
<br> 
<p>Pittsburgh is a city of bridges with a total of 446.[13] Pittsburgh has 
three bridges more thanVenice, Italy, which has historically held the title 
&quot;City of Bridges.&quot;[159] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near 
the city. The southern &quot;entrance&quot; to Downtown is through theFort Pitt 
Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Panhandle Bridge carries the Port 
Authority's Blue/Red/Brown subway lines across theMonongahela River. Over 2,000 
bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[160]</p> 
<h4>[edit] Expressways</h4> 
<p>Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the 
&quot;parkways.&quot;I-376 is both the &quot;parkway east&quot; connecting to 
I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the &quot;parkway west&quot; connecting to I-79
, thePittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and I-80. 
The &quot;parkway north&quot; isI-279 connecting to I-79. The 
&quot;crosstown&quot; isI-579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the 
Liberty Tunnels and the CONSOL Energy Center. Expressways such as Route 28 and 
Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, 
respectively.I-70, I-79 and I-76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a 
triangular-shaped &quot;beltway&quot; with I-80 andI-68 within the city's media 
market's northern and southern boundaries. Several suburban Turnpike spurs 
along theMonongahela River, the Airport and near Greensburg also help traffic 
flow. Navigation around the city and its suburbs can also be accomplished via 
the non-expresswayPittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System.</p> 
<p>A planned highway system called the Mon-Fayette/Southern Beltway project 
would allow access from the south and southwest of the city via a 
limited-access tolled expressway system.[161] The projects are in the planning 
stages with some sections already open to traffic. The projects are being 
planned by The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.[162]</p> 
<h4>[edit] Airports</h4> <br>
 Landside Terminal at Pittsburgh International 
Airport. 
<p>The city is served by Pittsburgh International Airport (IATA: <b>PIT</b>) 
17 miles (27 km) to the west inFindlay Township.[163] The airport was the long 
time major hub forUS Airways from the company's start in the 1940s until the 
mid 2000's. In 2000, US Airways and its regional affiliates operated over 500 
daily departures from Pittsburgh to more than 110 destinations; by 2007 fewer 
than 70 departures to 21 destinations remained.[164] However, in 2007, US 
Airways chose the city to house its new $25 million, 27,000 sq ft (2,500 m2), 
600-employees-strongGlobal Flight Operations Center, consolidating its two 
smaller (pre-merger) centers inPhoenix, Arizona and along I-376 in metro 
Pittsburgh. Currently, the largest promotions at the airport is the expansion 
of other airlines, particularlyDelta Air Lines' new direct trans-Atlantic 
service to Paris as well asJetBlue and Southwest Airlines rapid expansion at 
the complex.</p> 
<p>Art deco style Allegheny County Airport (AGC) handles 139,000 general 
aviation flights a year, and is located south of the city inWest Mifflin. There 
are also smaller airports located near the city used primarily for corporate 
jets and other private aircraft:Rock Airport is northeast of Pittsburgh near 
the borough ofTarentum and Pittsburgh-Monroeville Airport is east of the city in
Monroeville.</p> 
<p>Commercial service is also available at suburban Arnold Palmer Regional 
Airport in the borough of Latrobe via Spirit Airlines and formerly Delta Air 
Lines and US Airways commuter service.</p> 
<p>Several suburban private plane bases serve the region, the largest of these 
includeRostraver Airport and Pittsburgh-Monroeville Airport.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Public transportation</h4> 
<p>Port Authority of Allegheny County, commonly known as the Port Authority, 
but sometimes referred to by its former nickname &quot;PAT&quot; or &quot;PAT 
Transit&quot;, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a 
portion of the Pittsburgh area's 20th-largest metro area, it is the 
11th-largest transit agency in the nation. Port Authority runs a network of 
intracity and intercity bus routes, theMonongahela Incline funicular railway 
(more commonly known as an &quot;incline&quot;) on Mount Washington, alight rail
 system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a 
subway in the city, and one of the nation's largestbusway systems.[165] The 
Duquesne Incline is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[166] but it 
does accept Port Authority passes and charge standard Port Authority tolls.</p> 
<p>The city has Amtrak intercity rail service via the <i>Capitol Limited</i> 
and the<i>Pennsylvanian</i> at Pennsylvania Station, also known as Union 
Station. Currentfreight railroads include CSX and Norfolk Southern. 
Enhancements to allow for highspeed rail transit connections to Philadelphia 
and theNortheast Corridor are underway as part of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>

Steel Plaza subway station. <br>

<p>Between 2007 and 2010, the Port Authority cut its annual expenses by $52 
million and raised its revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a statewide 
transportation funding crisis.[167] The funding crisis only grew worse, 
however. The state legislature assumed it would receive permission to convert
Interstate 80 into a toll road to increase revenues, but the federal government 
denied the request, leading to a gap in the state transportation budget of $472 
million.[168]</p> 
<p>On November 24, 2010, the Port Authority's board of directors approved a 
massive service cut and fare hike to go into effect in March 2011. The service 
cut would reduce total service hours by approximately 35 percent, including the 
elimination of 45 routes.[167] The Port Authority's budget from the state is to 
be substantially reduced for 2011, and as chairperson Joan Ellenbogen noted, 
the Port Authority is legally required to adopt a balanced budget.[169] 
Chairperson Guy Mattola stated that &quot;Unfortunately, we are now at the 
point that all options have been exhausted ... It is necessary to move forward 
with this service reduction plan recognizing the devastating consequences for 
riders and non-riders alike.&quot;[170]</p> 
<p>On December 13, 2010, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission approved a 
plan by GovernorEd Rendell to allocate $45 million in temporary funding for the 
Port Authority to help reduce the magnitude of these service cuts.[171] 
Ultimately, service was cut 15 percent effective March 27, 2011.[172]</p> 
<h3>[edit] Utilities</h3>  Further information: Allegheny County Sanitary 
Authority <br>

<p>The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original power companies 
founded in 1912 byGeorge Westinghouse. Water utility service is provided by the 
Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[173] and Pennsylvania American Water.</p> 
<p>Natural gas is widely used in the area due to large reserves existing in 
the region. Service in Pittsburgh is provided byEquitable Gas and Columbia Gas. 
Both companies offer &quot;Customer Choice&quot; programs in which residents 
may choose alternative natural gas suppliers who work under an agreement to 
provide natural gas in smaller service areas; these companies include Dominion 
Peoples Plus, Direct Energy Services LLC, and Novec Energy Solutions.[<i>

andBrackenridge Works. A few related facilities such as the Clairton Works (a 
coking plant) and the Irvin Plant (a finishing plant) also reside within 
Allegheny County, but these are not steel mills per se because they do not 
produce steel. See thelist of US Steel facilities for details.</li> 
<li><b>^</b> Although medical research is often cited as a recent addition to 
Pittsburgh's economic portfolio, major advances go back several decades. 
Working at theUniversity of Pittsburgh in the 1950s, Jonas Salk developed the 
first successful vaccine for large-scale immunization againstpoliomyelitis 
(a.k.a. polio or infantile paralysis). Also, several types of organ transplants 
were pioneered in Pittsburgh by Dr.Thomas Starzl beginning in 1983. 
Pittsburgh's hospitals and universities remain the hosts for some of the 
premier medical research facilities in the world.</li>
