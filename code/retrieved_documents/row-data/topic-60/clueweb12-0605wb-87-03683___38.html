&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Since people can't seem to keep this issue 
out of the football thread, we should discuss it here.<br>
<br>
I, for one, 
prefer football over soccer for some of the following reasons:<br>
<br>

Football has more strategy. Each play is a battle of wits between the offense 
and the defense. Each side fights for the advantage, trying to dictate the play 
to the other team. You have to anticipate what your enemy is going to bring, 
and choose your own strategy accordingly, all before the ball is snapped. Every 
play is a mini chess game, and requires much higher levels of thinking than 
soccer. What startegies are there in soccer? Shrink the defense to strengthen 
the offense or vice versa? Choose between long passes, short passes, or 
dribbling? Is that it? It's so simple a child could figure it out (which is 
probably why so many American kids play it [I know I did] before they grow up 
and start to enjoy the more sophisticated game of football).<br>
<br>
Another 
problem I have with soccer is the players. Any game that encourages someone to 
fake an injury pisses me off. Watching these prima donnas flop around on the 
field because someone stepped on their toe makes me sick. And what makes it 
worse is that everyone knows that they're faking: the crowd, the other players, 
the coaches, the commentators, even the refs! And they still get away with it! 
When was the last time you remember an NFL player trying to pull that? And how 
could anyone compare the dangers of a soccer match with that of a football 
game? These people slam into each other at full speed play after play, get up 
and ask &quot;you want some more, b*tch?&quot; There's no comparison. I was 
watching the Stanley Cup playoffs last year, and some of the players started to 
pull that crap in order to get power plays. I threw up and then cursed the 
soccer gods for their unholy influence on a once noble sport!<br>
<br>
Another 
problem I have with soccer is the pace. The game is<i>so</i> slow, and I'm 
saying this as someone who is promoting a game with plays that last 
approximately 4 seconds. The play is concentrated in the middle of the field, 
where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone 
breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net. Then the 
goalie kicks the ball back to the middle of the field and we start all over 
again. 2 goals are considered a nearly insurmountable lead, and a team with the 
lead is content to sit back and kill 50 minutes of the game. In football, on 
the other hand, each play is executed at full speed, with full effort. If you 
don't want to give it your all, get off the field. And no lead is safe (ask 
Oilers' fans). You don't give up until the QB takes a knee and says checkmate.
<br><br>
Finally, I believe football is better, because it's the ultimate fan 
game. Fans can track every minute detail of their teams, second-guess every 
decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and 
even build their own teams. How many fantasy soccer leagues are out there? How 
many video game soccer tournaments are held? Where's the hubbub over Beckham 
2005?<br>
<br>
Football is a strategic war between two teams of highly 
specialized players. Soccer is hockey's retarded little brother. Posts: <b>622

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  I can appreciate football, but not love it. The 
problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a 
killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short 
like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time. And I've never really 
understood the rules, even though I've tried to read up on it. Since football 
plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, I 
actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have 
players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific 
players in action. Of course, I'm not big on either sport. Lacrosse takes the 
cake. And I'd rather play a sport than watch it, any day, even if it is 
football. Posts: <b>63</b> | Registered: <b>Jun 2004</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP:

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  thegreatgrundle, i 
can play your game aswell<br>
<br>
soccer has much more strategy then football, 
every player has many different taskes. there are hundreds of combintaions a 
team can do.<br>
ofcourse that every play is bitween the offence and defence. 
but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays 
as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need 
to wait a couple of minutes.<br>
what strategy is there in football?<br>
20 
refrigirators of a people collide with each other while to QB either choose to 
pass a line backer? or to ran with the ball himself?<br>
in soccer there are 
double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more 
sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.<br>
<br>
as for the 
pace, a good soccer game, has a very good pace, with allmost no stops, many 
passes and lots of attacks by both teams, while a football game as i said is 
divided in to short plays and most of them fail. so what is the exitment?<br>

<br>as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is 
catched by the referee he gets a yellow card. and believe me the crowd doesnt 
like fake injuries aswell.<br>
<br>
soccer is the ultimate fan game because the 
fans can also suggest and yell tactics to the coach, they can also swear freely 
on the coach the players and the other team coach and players <br>
<br>
as for 
the score, so what? if a goal whould count as 7 points then the game will be 
better?<br>
only. in football most games end in the 20-10 points result and 
that is equivalent to 2-1 in soccer, and any leade is no sade, ask Bayern 
Levekuzen the german team who lost 2-1 after 1-0 lead to Manchester united in 
the 90'th minute two goals were scored in less then a minute and that was in 
the champions league final of 1999. every thing can happen in soccer. Posts: <b>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Football (American rugby) is 
more fun to watch and futbawl (American soccer) is more fun to play.<br>
<br>

Futbawl is better exercise, football has too many 'fine adjustments' in its 
rule books (but I'm still opposed to the infield fly rule!). On the other hand, 
the Patriots beat Injun Nana last night, so I'll go with American football.<br>

<br>Who can spell Munchkin-Gladback anyway ...? and I'll bet I'm one of the few 
around here who was ever there! (It was near Cleves ... and Gary was more fun 
than M-G). Posts: <b>7864</b> | Registered: <b>Apr 2004</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP:

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Having played American 
football and being slightly familiar with rugby, I'd have to say that rugby is 
the sport for 'everybody'. It's like the love/hate child of soccer and 
football. You get nearly constant running as well as bonebreaking tackles. And 
nobody there is faking injuries for penatlies.<br>
<br>
But I am an American at 
heart and if I were to watch something on TV it would probably be American 
football. I played soccer as a kid, but never really got into it. And I'm 
currently WAT to out of shape to even worry about trying to find someone to 
play rugby with, but it is fun to think about. Posts: <b>673</b> | Registered:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Hannibal, you say that a 20-10 football game 
is the equivalent of a 2-1 soccer game, because they count each touchdown as 7 
points. But the scoring adds a whole new dimension to the game. It adds risk. 
Do you go for the win by scoring a more difficult TD, or do you take the sure 
points with a FG? And a touchdown isn't even worth 7 points. It's worth 6. Then 
you have to decide whether to take the sure PAT or risk everything to go for 2. 
Do you try to win/tie in one possession, or trust your defense to get the ball 
back so you can win in two?<br>
<br>
In soccer, your options are, &quot;well, I 
think we'll try to score 1 point, and if that fails, we'll try to score 1 
point, but we can always go for 1 point.&quot; So both teams are trying to do 
the same thing regardless. It's just not as interesting.<br>
<br>
And what do 
you mean, &quot;what strategy is there in football?&quot;? Every team has a 
playbook that weighs 10 pounds!<br>
<br>
@Richard<br>

<blockquote> quote:  Football (American rugby) is more fun to watch and 
futbawl (American soccer) is more fun to play. </blockquote>I actually agree 
with that. I played both as a kid, and preferred to play soccer. Then again, 
since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly 
enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser 
degree high school (I never made it past middle school. I was, and still am, 
far too small). Kids simply don't have the mental and physical skills necessary 
to play football the way it's supposed to be played, although just playing flag 
football, or everybody-run-down-the-field-and-I'll-throw-it football, was 
always a lot of fun. But maybe this is why I'll (and probably most Americans) 
will always see soccer as a little kids game.<br>
<br>
I remember when MLS 
started, everyone said it would take off because a lot of people had played 
soccer as a kid, and loved the game. Yeah, that worked . What are they down to, 
4 teams? When are they on, 3 am on ESPN 2? Come on. Posts: <b>622</b> |

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  OK, Hannibal, you're on the losing end of an argument. 
Soccer doesn't have 10% the strategy of football, and I love both games. Just 
for one of many things, in football players have more than one duty as well. 
The RB has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the WR may 
have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback 
and create holes for the runner.<br>
<br>
Soccer at it's very best is the 
finest game on earth. It's like music - fluent, improvisational, 
thrilling...nothing in the world like it. Like jazz or jazz influenced hip-hop. 
Just the funkiest and grooviest.<br>
<br>
However, Soccer is very rarely at its 
very best nowadays, due to the reluctance of the calcified FIFA to make 
necessary rule changes, whereas Football is currently tweaked nearly to 
perfection. If only they'd stop the game less (say by 30% or so).<br>
<br>
As 
for faking injuries - they do it in hoops too, and even in Football you'll see 
WR's trying to draw interference calls. The flopping in soccer is annoying, but 
that's why they have the very good rule nowadays of a yellow card for faking in 
the penalty area. Posts: <b>18864</b> | Registered: <b>Jan 2004</b>

&nbsp;  quit with all the blahblah. There is no argument. Soccer is just never 
going to cut it in America ! Soccer is for little kids. millions of little kids 
can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever 
play basketball or real football. They can get good exercise and wear a cute 
uniform and its is great for them. Oh and girls can play. I know I am going to 
hurt someones feelings here but have you ever watched a girls high school 
soccer game ? it is torture ! One girl is kicking one girl is chasing...and the 
other girls are biting their nails. Rugby rocks ! just my opinion<br>

&nbsp;  I guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is 
just about as interesting. When it comes to sports, I'd like to see stuff that 
looks cool, that's what sports mean to me. That's why I go for more obscure 
stuff like aikido, lacrosse, wakeboarding and whatnot. With football you get 
one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night. 
Makes good TV I guess. With all this football(rugby) and footbawl (kiddy sport) 
and football (pointy pigskin) I'm wondering where does football (pointy 
pigskin) originate from anyhow? Posts: <b>63</b> | Registered: <b>Jun 2004</b>

&nbsp;  try to watch some games from the brazilan national team maybe then you 
will see that soccer is the best sport.<br>
<br>
try to argue what sport is 
better on a south american or a european forum.<br>
i know that here i am 
outnumbered 100 to 1 so i dont have a chance.<br>
<br>
all in all i think it is 
a colture thing. like religion, your faviorite sport depends on where you are 
born. but unlike religion sport is good. and doesnt cause wars (besides a minor 
incident bitween bolivia and peru in 1967 i think) Posts: <b>3227</b> |

culture and niether is our religion. We are certainly influenced heavily by it, 
but not absolutly determined. I had hardly ever heard of rugby before visiting 
New Zealand now I like it as much if not more than American football. I would 
restate your comment that favorite sports are<b>usually</b> dependent on our 
culture. Posts: <b>673</b> | Registered: <b>Sep 2003</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP:

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  enough with this annoying 
political correctness<br>
ofcourse it usually depends.<br>
<br>
there are a few 
people who go against their family wishes or colture idioms every where. but 
most of the people like the team their father liked, and stuff like that.<br>

<br>i didnt say i hate football, i am one of those few israelis who know the 
rules and sometimes i watch it on ESPN but to me soccer is the best sport. and 
as ricky said, soccer at its best, is the best sport in the world. Posts: <b>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Um, brucie...your condescending 
pronouncements say a lot more about you than they do about whatever you're 
talking about. I suggest you try to limit yourself to expressing boredom with 
sports you don't dig, rather than contempt for those who practice and watch 
them. If you don;'t see the profound difference between the two, I suggest you 
think on it till it comes to you.<br>
<br>
I don't mean to start a flame war in 
the sports forum, but the way I see it, that's what you're doing. So I'll drop 
it if you will. Deal?<br>

&nbsp;  nyani, a good football (pigskin) game has like 10-15 plays that take 
your breath away, not one. Even a snoozer like tonight's Titans-Dolphins affair 
has at least one exciting play (Chris Brown's 52 yard romp, in this case).<br>

<br>As for where it comes from - the same gaellic ancestor that the various 
rugby games (including aussie rules) come from. Posts: <b>18864</b> |

&nbsp;  No, sorry, soccer gamess do not have 4 goals on average. They don't 
even have three. Most soccer games have anywhere between 2.5-2.85 goals per 
game.<br>
<br>
As for fluency -it's a different tempo altogether. Soccer 
doesn't stop, except to return the ball inbounds. Football stops by design. 
can't compare them that way.<br>
<br>
As for shot-gun - that's when the 
quarterback stands a few feet behind the center, not crouching directly behind 
him. This is done in cases where the defense MUST gain quite a lot of yards in 
one play (say 3rd down and 8). The extra few feet behind the line give the QB 
an extra second or two to find a reciever before the defensive players get to 
him. Posts: <b>18864</b> | Registered: <b>Jan 2004</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP: Logged

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  ricky B. I think its quite amazing that you even 
percieved my post as condescending. My remarks may have indeed eeked a bit of 
disdain for soccer... because , yes, I do think it is boring. but hardly 
condescending .I did say it was just my opinion. I thought that is what was 
invited in this forum...or do we all have to agree with you ? I apologize if I 
offended you. Posts: <b>22</b> | Registered: <b>Aug 2004</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP:

Hannibal - yes, I meant the offense. As for pleasing to the eye - when played 
at the highest level, I think you're absolutely right. Soccer has no equal. 
Brazil looked like that in the first half of their recent WC qualifier. Pure 
magic. Unfortunately, as I said, the rules currently discourage playing like 
that at the highest level.<br>
<br>
But Football has aesthetically pleasing 
elements and primally-appealing elements that Soccer simply doesn't. There is 
nothing in soccer, nut even the best slide tackle, like seeing your team's 
linebacker break through the line and NAIL the QB. A really good rushing or 
kick-return TD is every bit as beautiful as a great slalom goal. The motion 
itself is not as challenging, because a rusher doesn't need to control the ball 
with his feet, but he is eluding FULL contact. Posts: <b>18864</b> | Registered:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Hehe, I just read the regular newsletter from 
www.tshirthell.com ...<br>
<br>

<blockquote> quote: Last week in this column, I mentioned a sport European's 
call football. We<br>
Americans like to call it soccer, when we talk about it 
at all. Which<br>
fortunately, is not often. Usually, it's only to say things 
like, &quot;I was<br>
having trouble falling asleep last night, luckily ESPN2 
was showing soccer.&quot;<br>
Or, &quot;How did it feel when that rabid badger 
bit you in the face? It was<br>
about as enjoyable as soccer.&quot; Anyway, 
tons of annoying, European people<br>
took the time to unhitch their oxen, and 
come in from the fields to &quot;educate<br>
me&quot; about soccer.<br>
<br>

&quot;We call it football because we use our feet.&quot; They all whined. Yes, 
but<br>
aren't you wearing socks on those feet? Socks? Soccer? I rest my case.
<br><br>
Like most Americans I have no use for Europe, especially since we 
built such<br>
a swell version of it at Epcot, not to mention the one we built 
in Las<br>
Vegas. Superior to actual Europe in terms of rides, as well as 
buffets,<br>
both of these versions of Europe include things that appear to be 
kryptonite<br>
to most real Europeans; manners, toothpaste, and deodorant.<br>

<br>Yes I said manners. Europeans are rude. They refuse to speak English. And
<br>the ones who do speak English speak it poorly or with a funny accent. We<br>
didn't save your pusillanimous asses from Hitler to put up with this kind of<br>
piss poor attitude.<br>
<br>
I understand that most Europeans hate Americans. 
Good. We hate you more.<br>
You have nothing that we want. Legalized 
prostitution? We have it, not to<br>
mention all of the slutty American girls 
giving it away for free. Crumbling<br>
ruins? Look at our inner cities. People 
speaking foreign languages? Get<br>
in a cab. Which brings me to another point.
<br><br>
If you all hate America so much, will you please stop coming? I don't 
think<br>
they have patrol boats off the coast of Spain picking up flimsy rafts 
full<br>
of Americans trying to sneak into Europe so they can start a better 
life.<br>
<br>
When I walk through my estate it's like a tour of Europe. My 
butler is<br>
English, my maids are French, and my gardeners all speak some 
kind of<br>
gibberish so I assume they're from Europe, too. I would ask them, 
but like<br>
I said they all speak gibberish. Not to mention the fact that like 
all of<br>
my employees, any of them trying to speak directly to me will be 
taken away<br>
and fed to the hounds. Anyway, my chauffer is German and my 
bodyguards are<br>
all from Belgium. Belgians, are surprisingly resilient.<br>

<br>I guess there are some good things about Europe, like EuroDisney, and I hear
<br>they've built a Hard Rock Cafe. But other than that I think it's pointless,
<br>and much too far to be of any use to anyone.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  i also menaged to survive till 
0500 and watch the game bitween denver broncos and the somthing chiefs.<br>

since i was allmost at a sleepless blackout when i watch the game, the only 
thing i remmember is that, the blue-black team was much better then the white 
red team.<br>
<br>
the thing that made me wonder is this:<br>
why at some 
intervals bitween plays the countdown goes on, and sometimes the countdown 
stops. at first i thought it stops after a successfull down, but it was not the 
case. can some one clear this up? Posts: <b>3227</b> | Registered: <b>Oct 2003

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  oh ok<br>
so it is better 
for a leading team to try running plays and a team with less points to try to 
make passes it saves the time<br>
because half the game is lost during the 
intervals. Posts: <b>3227</b> | Registered: <b>Oct 2003</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp; IP:

&nbsp;  Rickyb... the funny thing is... Those were my nice serious comments. It 
is a good thing that soccer is for millions of little kids... That is great and 
they do wear cute little uniforms and yes girls get to play. And they do feel 
important. Those are good things. Posts: <b>22</b> | Registered: <b>Aug 2004</b>

&nbsp;  Those are condescending comments, which basically state that soccer is 
more about social concerns than sports. you said that soccer is for little kids 
- meaning it's not for &quot;real&quot;, grown-up athletes (contrary to the 
opinion of the vast majorityy of the world, of course...).<br>
<br>
You said 
&quot;cute little uniforms&quot;, as if other sports don't have those. Are you 
really trying to argue that &quot;cute little uniforms&quot; isn't a put-down?
<br><br>
You said &quot;girls can play&quot;, as if they can't and don't play 
basketball as well. Hell, there's even a pro women's football league.<br>
<br>

As for the &quot;couldn't play basketball or reall football&quot; - Just as 
most soccer players couldn't play high level Basketball or Football, the 
reverse is also true. Each sport has different physical requirements. Even a 
superb athlete like Randi Moss would most probably look foolish trying to 
dribble a soccer ball. Quentin Griffin would probably have done well, though, 
had he played from an early age. Posts: <b>18864</b> | Registered: <b>Jan 2004
