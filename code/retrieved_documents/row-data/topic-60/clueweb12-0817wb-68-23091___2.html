 Why 
Fantasy Football is Better Than Fantasy Basketball <br>
 By Kenn_Ruby <br>

 Anyone can do it! 
<p>Last week, I talked about how fantasy basketball is better than fantasy 
football, but the fact of the matter is that fantasy basketball can be just as 
frustrating as fantasy football, and in many ways, football is the superior 
product.&nbsp; In fact, many of the reasons I listed last week for why I like 
basketball more can actually be used as a reason for why football is 
better.&nbsp; Really.</p> 
<p><br>
<b>Head-to-head once a week is awesome.</b>&nbsp; I'm in some 
head-to-head basketball leagues and the whole category thing is just kind of 
dull.&nbsp; Hey, I won 5-to-3-to-1 this week!&nbsp; In football, you have one 
team to beat in points and you can spend all day Sunday watching your 
match-up.&nbsp; In basketball, you &quot;lose&quot; in turnovers even when you 
pull ahead in other categories.&nbsp; And with all those games (including late 
games), most of which aren't on t.v., it's less fun to &quot;watch&quot; your 
games.&nbsp; You just don't have the time.</p> 
<p><br>
<b>The big play can turn your week around.</b>&nbsp; When Kobe Bryant 
makes a steal and runs down the court for a thundering dunk, you can smile and 
say &quot;I got credit for a steal, two points, and my field goal percentage 
went up slightly.&quot;&nbsp; That's nice and all, but what happens when your 
running back explodes for a 50-yard TD?&nbsp; When your defense returns an 
interception for a touchdown?&nbsp; When your quarterback and receiver happen 
to be teammates and hook up for score?&nbsp; You can gain big points in a hurry.
</p> 
<p><br>
<b>Injury Reports.</b>&nbsp; What started as a nice piece of 
information for regular gamblers has become invaluable to fantasy players as 
well.&nbsp; You can find out easily if a player is out, doubtful, questionable, 
or probable, and usually a few days before Sunday.&nbsp; In basketball, you 
often find out about injuries<i>after</i> the game has started, when it's too 
late to do anything about.&nbsp; Additionally, a basketball player is far more 
likely to sit out a game with minor injuries or &quot;flu-like 
symptoms.&quot;&nbsp; That's what happens when you have 82 games instead of 16.
</p> 
<p><br>
<b>Anyone can play.</b>&nbsp; If you're in just one football league, 
it's so easy to keep track of it.&nbsp; All you have to remember is what day(s) 
you can pick up free agents, and you can then spend about five minutes making 
your moves for the week.&nbsp; You can win a league without doing much more 
than that.&nbsp; Even better, you can set up a football league very 
easily.&nbsp; We have one up and running in my office.&nbsp; I guarantee if I 
tried to do fantasy basketball in my office, I wouldn't get any more than three 
or four players.</p> 
<p><br>
<b>Bye weeks.</b> Ok, I hate bye weeks, but they do add a little 
strategy.&nbsp; I have a key week 10 battle against a rival, but my QB is on a 
bye.&nbsp; I had to make a trade to pick up a second quarterback just because I 
can't let Damian beat me.&nbsp; The closest fantasy basketball comes to this is 
when a player is playing only one or two games.&nbsp; Still, you wouldn't bench
Chris Paul if he only had two games this week, would you?<b></b></p>
