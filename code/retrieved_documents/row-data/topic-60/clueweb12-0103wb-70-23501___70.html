<h1>Is an NBA championship more desirable than an NCAA basketball&nbsp;title?

<p>I have seen several people comment that John Calipari's tweet that he will 
be at Kentucky next year, now supplemented by thisLexy audio where you can hear 
him say it in his own words, with his own voice, is essentially a 
deception.&nbsp; That's what you mean when you say you don't believe a person 
when they make an unequivocal statement like Calipari did.</p> 
<p>Of course, the Big Blue Nation is now used to this, and instead of jumping 
into the breach and defending the Kentucky coach from his detractors again, I 
am going to ask this question -- is winning an NBA championship more impressive 
than winning an NCAA national championship?&nbsp; Is it a more worthy life goal 
for a coach?</p> 
<p>The answer, I suspect, is largely dependent upon where the person answering 
the question's fanhood lies.&nbsp; NBA fans who are only casual fans of college 
basketball would surely answer in the affirmative.&nbsp; College basketball 
fans who think the NBA game is less worthy would likely think the 
negative.&nbsp; There is really no right or wrong answer, I suppose, but the 
reason it is worthy of discussion is that you would think it would figure into 
any decision Calipari might have to make, depending on what the ultimate 
outcome of the Summer of Lebron is.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The NBA championship has officially been around since 1947, three years as 
the Basketball Association of America and the rest as the NBA.&nbsp; During the 
nearly 63 years of the NBA championship series, there have been a total of 17 
different teams winning the title.&nbsp; Currently, there are 30 NBA 
franchises, and of those 30, only 12 of the currently active franchises have 
won championships under their original names (although six winners have changed 
cities).&nbsp; Four of the franchises have been renamed, and one championship 
winner no longer exists (the Baltimore Bullets).</p> 
<p>There have been five NBA coaches who have won four titles or more -- Phil 
Jackson (10), Red Auerbach (9), Pat Riley (5), Ray Kundla (5), and Greg 
Popovich (4).&nbsp; Of these, I would venture that only Jackson, Auerbach and 
Riley are actually household names.&nbsp; Popovich is certainly known to anyone 
who has watched the NBA in recent times, but hardly leaps to the tongue.&nbsp; 
Ray Kundla, who lead the Lakers (then in Minneapolis) to 5 titles, is the 
answer to a trivia question.&nbsp; NBA coaches who have won four titles or less 
are known only to fans of the league and the fans of their respective programs.
</p> 
<p>College basketball has been around much, much longer than the NBA -- almost 
twice as long.&nbsp; The NCAA Championship has only been around since 1939, but 
even so, that's 12 years longer than the NBA Championship.&nbsp; During the 
history of the tournament, 35 teams out of the now 347 division I colleges 
fielding teams (note:&nbsp; this has changed substantially over the yeas) have 
claimed championships.</p> 
<p>Household name coaches in NCAA basketball for their work done on the floor 
include John Wooden, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Mike Krzyzewski and Bobby Knight 
(although Knight is at least as well known for his antics as his 
victories).&nbsp; Fans of the college sport, and even casual fans from other 
sports would also recognize names like Bill Self, Jim Calhoun, Jim Boeheim, 
Lute Olson, Rick Pitino and John Calipari.</p> 
<p>What the NBA has going for it are larger team fan bases, more player name 
recognition, more marketing and apparel tie-ins and even more media exposure as 
an institution than the NCAA championship.&nbsp; I can't say for sure, but I 
would guess that there are substantially more casual NBA fans worldwide than of 
college basketball.&nbsp; The NBA also unquestionably has the best players, 
since only the cream of the college crop ever make it in the Association.</p> 
<p>What the NCAA has going for it are arguably more passionate and dedicated 
fans.&nbsp; Fans of college basketball tend to be less &quot;fair weather&quot; 
and more likely to follow the team even in down years.&nbsp; The NCAA 
tournament is also unquestionably more difficult for a given team to win, even 
considering only the historically best teams.&nbsp; This is due largely to the 
single-elimination design of the NCAA tournament versus the series format of 
the NBA.</p> 
<p>The NBA and NCAA also present distinctly different challenges to 
coaches.&nbsp; The NBA season is much longer requiring many long trips to 
faraway cities.&nbsp; Coaching in the NBA is more an exercise in business 
management than actual coaching, since the players are often employed more like 
financial assets in a Monopoly game.&nbsp; The NBA requires a coach to manage 
personalities more than anything else, as he is coaching mostly full-grown men 
making six and seven figure salaries per year.&nbsp; There are no NCAA 
violations to worry about, no grades to manage, and virtually no job security 
whatever.&nbsp; There is very little actual teaching of basketball done in the 
pros -- mostly just skills refinement for which the players are primarily 
responsible.</p> 
<p>The NBA coach has a much shorter season with many fewer games and less time 
on the road.&nbsp; He has to teach his charges everything from fundamentals to 
the speed of the game.&nbsp; The coach must manage his players in every detail 
from grades to rules compliance to media appearances to matters of 
discipline.&nbsp; He must constantly recruit replacements due to a high 
turnover in addition to his coaching duties, and the most time he can ever get 
out of a player is four years.&nbsp; Job security is better than the NCAA, but 
far from tenure.&nbsp; His public relations responsibilities in jobs like 
Kentucky and North Carolina are substantial.&nbsp; Overall, even though he is 
gone from his home town less, he is arguably away from the house even more.</p> 
<p>In the end, I see no practical difference between the value of winning an 
NBA or NCAA championship as a coach.&nbsp; I would, in fact, be inclined to 
argue that the NCAA coach is more meritorious in terms of pure basketball 
coaching, but others may rationally disagree.&nbsp; Overall, though, I have a 
hard time with the default idea that an opportunity to coach LeBron James to an 
NBA title is so tempting that no college coach could turn down the 
opportunity.&nbsp; I find such opinions entirely suspect to say the least, even 
though I can't reasonably reject them completely.</p> 
<p>I still insist that no matter what LeBron does, absent kidnapping or 
blackmail, will convince Calipari to leave this year.&nbsp; Your mileage may 
vary on this view.</p>

<h5> Interesting </h5> 
<p>I noticed all the coaches you listed, I believe have won a national 
championship. With one exception.<br>
 Are we to understand that individual 
should be counted in those victors when coaches like Bob Huggins and others 
wouldn&rsquo;t gualify to be mentioned as quality coaches who might have choose 
to remain in the college game?<br>
 How many of those coaches you mentioned 
&lsquo;took the leap&rsquo; and found they or some one for them, found they 
didn&rsquo;t fit?<br>
 And Bobby Knight, the hated, seems to always draw an 
added comment.</p> 
<p>I have be correctly accused of having a 'football fetish'. You know, 
someone who doesn't think football is the warm up sport to basketball season.

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the stay in the NBA for coaches being longer than 
the coaches at universities. Truly I don&rsquo;t.<br>
 That would be an 
interesting study for someone to do.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t follow pro basketball. 
Never did.<br>
 I enjoy college sports were young men are striving to get to 
the next level. Playing with, we hope, intensity, and for the sake of winning.

<h5> In the NBA ... </h5> 
<p>a team can be built. Players are selected, not recruited, you can get 
experienced players right away with no need for development, and holes can be 
filled in the cases of injury or need during the season. You also have key 
players for as long as you want to pay what they demand, no one and dones or 
graduating seniors to worry about.</p> 
<p> by jpbluekat on  May 15, 2010 5:09 PM EDT reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> But how much control does the coach have to build that team in the NBA? 
</h5> 
<p>Player choices in the NBA are motivated by money as much, if not more, than 
the talent needs of the team. Key players can be gone in as little as a season 
due to free agency or the whims of management. NBA coaches (unless 
they&rsquo;re Phil Jackson) have almost no control over who they get as players.
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d also disagree with the idea that the NBA has much more talented 
players. I think that the concept of the one-and-done college player will do as 
much harm to the NBA talent pool as it is to the NCAA talent pool. Consider 
that many people acknowledge that NBA players are not &ldquo;coached,&rdquo; 
but are simply managed. Tru states (and I agree) that there is very little 
teaching of basketball in the NBA. But if a kid has only had limited (or no) 
college experience, where are they going to learn the type of basketball acumen 
that the pros demand? Natural talent of the Kobe or Labron kind is rare. Most 
of these kids need more than one year of college to learn enough basketball 
knowledge to make it in the pros. So I think as more and more kids go 
one-and-done due to inflated draft expectations, the NBA talent itself will 
start to become watered down, as kids who simply need more coaching than the 
NBA will provide won&rsquo;t flourish.</p> 
<p>You can put it on the board....YES.</p>

<h5> Good point... </h5> 
<p>in the NBA the coach just becomes another piece of the puzzle. So maybe 
comparing the two, NCAA vs. NBA is the classic &ldquo;apples and oranges&rdquo;.

<h5> thats because NBA coaches dont want to have to deal with NCAA 
violations.....keeping up with the money and where it is spent </h5> 
<p>and a lot of the mundane things an NCAA coach has to do. Most coaches, just 
want to coach&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;in college you cannot do that. And it is 
the only place that you cannot do that. Administrators keep up with grades and 
problems at the high school level. Pros only have to show up at practices and 
games, and keep the firearms out of their hands, as well as themselves out of 
places they dont belong. Question is not as easily &ldquo;settled&rdquo; as you 
might think. There is a mindset for each level&hellip;..that is the most 
important thing to have. Some coaches can change their mindset for the players 
they have to deal with, some cannot. College coaches must motivate, pro coaches 
must manage (but this line blurs more and more every year).</p>

<h5> There have been many. </h5> 
<p>Larry Brown, Rick Pitino, Tim Floyd among others.</p> 
<p>But as usual, your fallacy is one of generalization. Most of the coaches 
who would &ldquo;kill&rdquo; to coach in the NBA would also kill to coach at 
Kentucky, North Carolina, or UCLA.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t see Ben Howland, Roy Williams, or Coach K clamoring to move

<p>Your less than a handful of examples does not make a case. Floyd was an 
abject failure in the NBA and had nowhere else to go. The same can be said of 
Pitino. The NCAA is the &lsquo;refuge&rsquo; of failed NBA coaches&hellip;Cal

wound up in college. Which also shows that while football has the examples of 
coaches of major universities going to the pros, basketball has almost none.</p>

<h5> here's ten of the most known </h5> 
<p>borrowed from <br>
 The Lost LettermeTop 10 Biggest NCAA-To-NBA Coaching 
Bombs<br>
 105<br>
 diggs<br>
 digg ShareKentucky&rsquo;s Big Blue Nation can 
breath easy as John Calipari just announced on Twitter that he will be 
returning to Lexington next season. It&rsquo;s a smart move considering 
he&rsquo;s now royalty in the Bluegrass State and went just 72-112 during his 
stint with the Nets in the late &lsquo;90s, ranking him among the Top 10 
Biggest NCAA-To-NBA Coaching Bombs of all time based on how far they fell short 
of expectations. The lesson here kids? Stay in school.<br>
 10. Clair Bee</p> 
<p>From 1931 to 1951, Bee&rsquo;s Long Island University squads won an unheard 
of 95 percent of their games and won two NITs. He jumped to the NBA in 1952 
where his winning percentage wasn&rsquo;t quite as good. In two seasons with 
the Baltimore Bullets, he went 32-107 and never coached an NBA game again. But 
his mark on the game remains, as he&rsquo;s responsible for the 1-3-1 zone 
defense, the three-second rule and the 24-second shot clock.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>9. John Calipari</p> 
<p>Calipari&rsquo;s final five season prior to jumping for the NBA were just 
as impressive as Rick Pitino&rsquo;s prior to his jump. His UMass teams 
dominated the A-10, winning the conference regular season and tournament titles 
all five seasons. In the last two years, he reached the Elite Eight and Final 
Four (well, technically this Final Four appearance no longer exist). So 
Calipari left to save the moribund Nets in 1996. After a disastrous first 
season, he did manage to reach the NBA Playoffs as a No. 8 seed in year two. 
But he couldn&rsquo;t carry the momentum, beginning the next season 3-17 before 
being canned. So much for refusing to lose.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p> 
<p>8. Jerry Tarkanian<br>
 Looming NCAA investigations into his program at 
UNLV essentially forced Tarkanian out of his job with the Runnin&rsquo; Rebels. 
But after coaching arguably the greatest college basketball team ever (NCAA 
violations be damned), the Spurs gave him a shot in the pro ranks in 1992. What 
Tarkanian wanted more than the job, however, was a point guard, something owner 
Red McCombs disagreed with. The rift between the two only got bigger until 
McCombs canned Tarkanian after a 9-11 start. Said McCombs: &quot;I have a hard 
time with my coach telling me three times a day, seven days a week that we 
can&rsquo;t compete with top teams.&quot; The Shark was axed after just 20 
games.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>7. Reggie Theus<br>
 Theus coached just two seasons at New Mexico State but 
he didn&rsquo;t waste any time turning the program into a winner. After a good 
16-14 record, the team exploded to 25-9 and a 2007 NCAA appearance in year two. 
But Theus&rsquo; magic only worked in college. He went 38-44 in his first 
season with Sacramento and then got off to a 6-18 start in his second season 
before getting the boot. Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have his stats during his 
tenure as head coach of the Deering High School Tornadoes in &quot;Hang 
Time.&quot; We&rsquo;re sure they were good though.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..</p> 
<p>6. Paul Westhead<br>
 Westhead is an interesting case because he had brief 
professional success with the Lakers before landing at Loyola Marymount. It was 
there he perfected &quot;The System&quot; run by Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble 
which eventually led to the emotional Elite Eight run in 1990. Westhead took 
another shot at the professional ranks, installing his run-and-gun offense in 
Denver. Despite scoring a league best 119.9 points a game, they gave up the 
most points in the league (130.8). People even referred to the team as the 
Enver Nuggets (as in no &quot;D&quot;). He was fired after two seasons and a 
44-120 record.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>5. P.J. Carlesimo<br>
 Carlesimo is responsible for making Seton Hall 
basketball, getting the program to its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1988 
and finishing as national runners up in 1989. In all, he took the Pirates to 
six NCAA Tournaments and was named Big East Coach of the Year twice. Carlesimo 
made the jump to the NBA in 1994 and went to the playoffs his first three 
seasons &ndash; but keep in mind this team was used to being at the top of the 
Western Conference with Clyde Drexler and Co. He never got out of the first 
round and was whacked after three seasons. His stop at Golden State did not go 
as well &ndash; and that&rsquo;s not even including being choked by Latrell 
Sprewell. He coached Oklahoma City last season but was fired after a 1-12 
start. In all, Carlesimo&rsquo;s NBA winning percentage is a paltry 41 percent.
</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>4. Lon Kruger<br>
 Not counting his first head coaching gig, Kruger was 
very successful in college. At Kansas State, Florida and Illinois, he made the 
NCAA Tournament in 12 of those 14 years and reached the Final Four once. So 
it&rsquo;s no surprise he was a confident man. So confident, in fact, that as 
coach of the Atlanta Hawks in 2002, he guaranteed fans a $125 refund if the 
Hawks didn&rsquo;t reach the playoffs. Kruger didn&rsquo;t even reach the end 
of the season before he was fired. The team finished 35-47 and, sadly, no one 
got their money.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>3. Leonard Hamilton<br>
 In the 40 seasons before Hamilton came to the 
University of Miami in 1991, the Hurricanes reached the postseason four times. 
From 1991-2000, Hamilton took Miami to the Big Dance five times. As is the case 
with a lot of these coaches, the ability to turnaround a program is a big lure 
for NBA GMs, and in 2000 the Washington Wizards came calling. But the only 
thing Hamilton turned around were people&rsquo;s lunches after a 19-63 record.
</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..</p> 
<p>2. Tim Floyd<br>
 He was called &quot;Timothy The Great&quot; at Iowa State 
after leading the Cyclones to three NCAA Tournaments and one basket away from 
the 1997 Elite Eight. Floyd&rsquo;s arrival in Chi-town was a recipe for 
disaster, replacing Phil Jackson and having a standoff with &quot;His 
Airness,&quot; who refused to play for Floyd. But no one expected Floyd to go 
just 49-190 &ndash; the worst winning percentage of any coach with 200 games 
under his belt. Marinate on that for a second. He redeemed himself slightly in 
2003 by going 41-41 with the New Orleans Hornets &ndash; only to get fired at 
the end of the year despite making the playoffs.</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>1. Rick Pitino<br>
 What makes Pitino the biggest bomb is the expectations 
that came with his arrival in Boston. Pitino had brought Lexington its first 
national title in 18 years. His final six seasons saw two Elite Eight finishes, 
three Final Four appearances and a national championship. There was reason to 
believe he would succeed in Bean Town after a successful stint with the New 
York Knicks. He was expected to bring the Celtics back to glory and was given 
total control of the team as coach, GM, CEO and President.</p> 
<p>But his time with the Celtics was an epic failure. It appeared jinxed from 
the beginning when, despite the worst record in the league, the Celtics 
didn&rsquo;t win the lottery and the Spurs got Tim Duncan instead. The height 
of his frustration culminated in an epic rant that included the classic, 
&quot;Larry Bird is not walking through that door, fans&quot; line. Pitino 
walked out the door in 2001 and back to college basketball with his tail 
between his legs after a 102-146 record in four seasons in Boston.</p> 
<p>Said Pitino afterward: &quot;The University of Kentucky is the Roman 
Empire, they are Camelot, it was the biggest mistake of my life leaving 
Lexington.&quot; It appears John Calipari took note.</p> 
<p>n</p> 
<p>I have be correctly accused of having a 'football fetish'. You know, 
someone who doesn't think football is the warm up sport to basketball season.

<h5> Here's ten............. </h5> 
<p>Very good post Paris Guy. I do &ldquo;personally&rdquo; disagree with one 
point though. According to Quinn Buckner, no dummy, the 1996 UK Wildcats was 
the greatest team to ever take the floor in NCAA history. His remark came just 
before the tip-off of the championship game against Syracuse in 1996. And Mr. 
Buckner on his own admission &ldquo;hated&rdquo; the University of Kentucky. 
Proves one thing though, that one can hate an opponent yet make an honest 
evaluation about them.</p>

<h5> There's a reason they call it &quot;the next level&quot; </h5> 
<p>I believe that for most coaches, that&rsquo;s how they see it. Not all, but 
most. It&rsquo;s a business to Cal. He doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bleed blue&rdquo; 
in the sense that UK fans do. Of course he&rsquo;s all in in terms of 
commitment while he&rsquo;s there. But the UK &ldquo;branding&rdquo;, etc, is 
just smart business. He understands the business of basketball and he backs it 
up with his M.O. He attracts the recruits that want to &ldquo;advance&rdquo; to 
the next level (NBA) and provides the path through UK.</p> 
<p>Since that&rsquo;s his sales pitch, it only makes sense that&rsquo;s his 
belief.</p> 
<p>Now, to answer your question on which is better? Personally, it&rsquo;s 
even. To Cal, it&rsquo;s the NBA.</p> 
<p> by RhinoDawg on  May 15, 2010 11:34 PM EDT reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> you had me till the end </h5> 
<p>I agree completely with everything before that. It&rsquo;s not shocking or 
scandalous or hurtful to fans to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a business to 
Cal,&rdquo; because, well, duh. I don&rsquo;t think we fans expect that UK 
basketball can ever mean quite the same thing to a coach, who comes from 
elsewhere, has worked for other programs and is paid to do the job, as it does 
to the fans, for whom Kentucky fandom literally feels like a part of the 
genetic code. OF course he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bleed blue&rdquo; in the same 
way that we do. It&rsquo;s a job to coaches&mdash;we get it, it&rsquo;s cool. 
You&rsquo;re right that Calipari demonstrates astute business sense about the 
job&mdash;the work on branding, the marketing of his ability to get players to 
&ldquo;the next level.&rdquo; Again, all this is fine with us&mdash;it;s done 
in the service of making UK basketball better. We get the fact that the elite 
players don&rsquo;t come from the hollers of Kentucky where selling only 
Kentucky&rsquo;s fine history might be enough to ensure we get the best players 
and the best possible teams. I WANT a brilliant salesman and business mind in 
the top spot of the program.</p> 
<p>But this? &ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s his sales pitch, it only makes sense 
that&rsquo;s his belief.&rdquo; Really? Do you think sales piches always reveal 
the seller&rsquo;s true and honest beliefs? You must buy a lot of useless 
products ; ) And then there&rsquo;s this: &ldquo;To Cal, it&rsquo;s the 
NBA.&rdquo; Again, really? I don&rsquo;t get this reading deep physological 
insight into people known only in a public sense, but even if you 
could&hellip;marketing NBA dreams to elite h.s. basketball talent as a way to 
convince them to come to Kentucky is NOT contradictory. Cal (or any other 
coach, and let&rsquo;s face it, they all do this) isn&rsquo;t betraying a 
preference for the pro game by extolling his ability to get you 
there&mdash;because the pro game and the college game are mutually exclusive. 
College is a conduit to get to a job for ALL of us. A college business school 
selling its ability to get you to a Fortune 500 company isn&rsquo;t being 
disloyal to the school&mdash;they&rsquo;re marketing the very skills that they 
give you, and their usefulness in the &ldquo;real world.&rdquo; Same with 
sports coaches, right?</p> 
<p>To answer the original question, naturally it&rsquo;s just a matter of 
opinion and no one is right or wrong. But speaking as a Kentuckian&hellip;well, 
of COURSE the college title, because there is no sport on earth more important 
and wonderful than college basketball. : )</p>

<h5> bkg: One of the benefits of foreign readership </h5> 
<p>is that they can look at a situation with fresh, unbiased eyes (at least in 
this case). This is what I have done here. Coach Cal is doing exactly what he 
should do as it pertains to his vision of the program, and he&rsquo;s good at 
it. I&rsquo;m also pointing out the fact that the way he is doing things 
&ndash; promoting Kentucky more as a gateway to the NBA rather than as a 
&ldquo;whole&rdquo; University of Kentucky experience that also includes 
potential NBA benefits &ndash; is an indication of his value system. Meaning, 
he puts more value on getting people through to the &ldquo;next level&rdquo; 
than he does on the broader scope of the college experience as a whole. Fine by 
me, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to a loving relationship to the 
&ldquo;program&rdquo; as much as the &ldquo;process&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;results&rdquo;. The player&rsquo;s grades, albeit only one year, is 
another indicator that once the results are achieved (five into the NBA) the 
rest is less important. Maybe next year he&rsquo;ll prove me wrong.</p> 
<p>Regardless, his actions validate my opinion that his sales pitch is based 
on his beliefs. And he&rsquo;s good at selling what many of these kids are 
buying. But does that mean that he values the head coaching job at UK more than 
an NBA job? In my opinion, no. If he valued UK and his job as his ultimate 
position, he would be more immersed in the entire college experience and his 
pitch would be more to that end. On the contrary, that&rsquo;s not what 
he&rsquo;s selling.</p> 
<p>As you stated, I don&rsquo;t have a psychological insight into John 
Calipari &mdash; NOBODY does! I agree that his actions are not contrary to the 
love of the position; only to the position as his personal nirvana. I&rsquo;m 
not suggesting that he&rsquo;s evil, or disloyal, doesn&rsquo;t love his job, 
or isn&rsquo;t doing what he feels is best. But if you pit the UK job, arguably 
the best college basketball job in the country, against the best NBA job in the 
country, my guess is Cal chooses the latter.</p>

<h5> Not necessarily, </h5> 
<p>but I believe that for Coach Cal, at some point it is. And that&rsquo;s not 
a knock on Kentucky. I just don&rsquo;t think UK is his final destination, and 
there&rsquo;s no where else to aspire to in the college ranks.</p> 
<p> by RhinoDawg on  May 16, 2010 1:41 PM EDT up reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> But why would you think that? </h5> 
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly clear that the NBA thing has been tried by Cal. He has 
been there, done that, got the t-shirt.</p> 
<p>This is new to him, something he&rsquo;s never done &mdash; coach a 
legendary program. His choice, if you believe the rumors, are between coaching 
a legendary college program (something he has aspired to for years &mdash; he 
could have gone to the NBA any one of a dozen times while at Memphis), or 
coaching one presumably legendary player &mdash; Lebron James.</p> 
<p>At best, his run in the NBA would be seven or eight years, and even if he 
wins a couple of NBA championships in that time, will he be remembered? LeBron 
will, but not Cal.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if he wins 2 or more national championships at UK, he is 
a mortal lock for the HOF. His best work, by far, has been done in college, and 
that&rsquo;s where his heart seems to be. He uses the interface between the NBA 
and college for his own purposes, but if you take the fact that he has been 
waiting FOR YEARS for a shot to coach at a place like Kentucky, it makes no 
sense that he would want to leave anytime soon.</p>

<h5> That's the question </h5> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I didn&rsquo;t know he had been waiting for years to 
coach at a place like Kentucky. That does make a big difference as to when he 
might leave, and adds something to the &ldquo;if&rdquo; argument as well. If 
true, I agree that to have waited so long for that situation and then up and 
leave a year or two later makes no sense.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, what if he was presented with a reasonably clear path to 
an NBA championship? That might not have been in the cards before. Timing is 
everything. You&rsquo;re 100% right about the fact that he won&rsquo;t leave UK 
to coach an average team in a bad market for the sake of coaching in the NBA. I 
never meant to imply that. However, Coach Cal is a competitor, and I still 
think he has some unfinished business in the NBA, and he may feel that claiming 
an NBA championship (the highest level in the world) authenticates his career.
</p> 
<p>I guess the answer doesn&rsquo;t lie in so much as what we believe makes 
sense, but rather in what motivates Calipari to to what he does. Funny, over 
the past few months I&rsquo;ve learned more about him and have a different 
impression of him than I once did. To understand the actions is to understand 
the man, and you definitely have the upper hand there.</p>

<p>You mean like the one LeBron and Co. were supposed to have this year?</p> 
<p>Betting on &ldquo;sure things&rdquo; in basketball is a sure road to ruin. 
But I do take your point that what motivates Calipari is really the issue. If 
he finds the prospect of an NBA championship more appealing than becoming a 
college coaching legend, then I think he may well leave.</p> 
<p>I just happen to think that isn&rsquo;t the case. I could be wrong. It 
would not be the first time, or the last. :-)</p>

<h5> Next level of coaching </h5> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, Tru, and I think I would have to go with no on 
that. College coaches are &ndash; IMO &ndash; much more important to the team 
than NBA coaches. The college coach is the captain of the ship, so to speak, 
the team looks to them for guidance. The college coach is giving the 
&ldquo;orders&rdquo; and the team carries them out. The college coach is 
definitely &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; and is the one with the knowledge and the 
game plan for the game. The NBA coach as a lot LESS control. It is not uncommon 
&ndash; I would think &ndash; for players on the team to make more money than 
the coach and in the sense of being &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; I really feel that 
the players in the NBA are the ones running the show and coaches can become 
nothing more than a puppet in a suit on the sideline. As NBA players get bigger 
and bigger, they control more and more about the team as a whole in many 
different ways.</p> 
<p>Cal doesnt seem to me to be the type to really enjoy that kind of thing. 
Yes &ndash; Cal is known for the &ldquo;let the players play their game&rdquo; 
style of bball, BUT the key word there is &ldquo;let.&rdquo; At the college 
level, Cal is still &ldquo;the man with the plan.&rdquo; He gets to stand up at 
press conferences and say things like, &ldquo;They are still learning. They are 
gonna make mistakes.&rdquo; Etc. Let him try saying something like that about a 
big NBA superstar. I think Cal much prefers being &ldquo;the man.&rdquo; Im not 
saying that&rsquo;s good or thats bad, I just think he likes himself out front 
way too much to be &ldquo;overshadowed&rdquo; as far as his contribution to the 
team and the success.</p>

<h5> Many pro coaches make less than Calipari. </h5> 
<p>Of course, no pro team would offer him less than what he is currently 
making, so in all honesty, that&rsquo;s not completely relevant.</p> 
<p>If Calipari went to the NBA, it would likely only be for a situation that 
provided control over player personnel (I believe Pitino had that deal) as well 
as a substantial raise.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that will happen for a number of reasons, not the 
least of which it has failed every time it has been tried when bringing a coach 
from the college ranks. That doesn&rsquo;t prove that it can&rsquo;t be done, 
of course, but the terrible history of college coaches moving to the NBA will 
surely be a factor.</p> 
<p>Finally, I don&rsquo;t think Calipari believes that coaching in the NBA is 
more useful to his legacy than coaching in college. Many, many people disagree 
with me on that, though, and I can&rsquo;t claim they are suffering from more 
cognitive dissonance than I.</p>

<h5> Legacy </h5> 
<p>What coach does not want to be remembered long after their time on the 
sidelines has ended? Cal has already begun working on that here at the college 
level. He is much more likely to acheive that goal at the college level than in 
the NBA just looking at the time he wants to remain coaching. Based on the 
amount of years Cal envisions himself still coaching, it is far more likely 
that he will win enough (conference titles, Final Fours, Championships, 30-win 
seasons, etc) to be considered one of the best coaches of all time in college 
rather than the NBA. There is more opportunity to win at the college level, 
IMO. In order to build the legacy I feel Cal is looking for, he would have to 
win the NBA championship virtually every year and we all know how likely that 
is.</p>

both just hasn&rsquo;t happened because of that. Interestingly enough though 
Larry Brown is the exception and we all know how Cal feels about Larry.</p> 
<p>I think that Cal wants to win at UK before he considers other options since 
UK gives him the best chance for an NCAA title or titles. Once that happens, I 
believe he will consider NBA options but not before.</p>

<h5> You may be onto something here </h5> 
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not that Calipari simply values an NBA title more than an 
NCAA title. Maybe he wants both! If that&rsquo;s the case, the decision 
isn&rsquo;t whether or not he&rsquo;ll jump to the NBA &ndash; he will &ndash; 
but when. If he feels like he can get the college championship easier than an 
NBA he may look at his current NBA opportunity as his best shot to check that 
off his list. If not, his best chance at an NCAA title has to be with Kentucky.

<h5> Not impossible. </h5> 
<p>But that is an extraordinarily unlikely scenario. It happened with Larry 
Brown, but Brown is a gypsy that Calipari is not, and has coached no less than 
10 NBA teams, almost 1/3 of the entire league at one time or another.</p> 
<p>You never know what he might be thinking, but I consider that quite 
unlikely. He would be more famous for winning multiple times at UK than for 
winning one in college and even two in the pros.</p>

<h5> Agreed, </h5> 
<p>if fame is indeed the motivating factor. If it is, he&rsquo;s not going 
anywhere. As great as Phil Jackson and Red Auerabach are/were, you still have 
to look at John Wooden as the most famous coach of all time. There&rsquo;s just 
so much more passion in the college game. Love it.</p>

<h5> We are all in basic agreement </h5> 
<p>The most likely (in my mind) scenario is:<br>
 Cal wins 3 at UK and takes 
them to 10 NCAA titles overall to tie UCLA (unless of course UCLA sneaks in 
another). Remember he talked about 10 wins at UK early on. THEN he goes pro 
with what he considers the best team with the best ownership at that time to 
win multiple NBA crowns. Cal does not know how to think small &ndash; I mean 
what other coach takes over an NIT team and encourages his players to believe 
they can go undefeated before they ever play a game? The man thinks big &ndash; 
I love it!!!</p>

<h5> Logic vs math </h5> 
<p>I guess there was a reason I didn&rsquo;t get my engineering degree!! Had 
to switch to business.</p> 
<p>You are right but then again I always resented Wooden announcing his 
retirement (and my very unobjective opinion is that we would have won 
otherwise) the night before they played UK so I don&rsquo;t want to give them 
that one!!! Sour grapes I know.</p> 
<p>Still think Cal wants multiple wins in both the NCAA and the NBA.</p>

<p>Quite right. They got number 11 under that guy who was fired the next season
<br> and UCLA had an investigation into something illegal. Oh yeah, his name 
was Steve Lavin who now works for ESPN. Of course you never hear about the 
firing or the investigation. Hmmmmmm. Par for the course. LOL</p>

<h5> Fame </h5> 
<p>I totally believe that is what Cal wants at the end of the day. I say he 
stays at the college level simply because the gamble of becoming one of those 
coulda-been great coaches that goes out on a low is more than he is willing to 
take. He has got as much of a &ldquo;sure thing&rdquo; in that area as one 
could hope for right now.</p> 
<p>It is not worth an intelligent man&rsquo;s time to be in the majority. By 
definition, there are already enough people to do that.</p>

<h5> NBA Championship vs. NCAA Title? </h5> 
<p>I meant to comment on this feature post yesterday, but I had a million 
things going on and I&rsquo;m just now getting back to it. I see that several 
people have mentioned some things that I was going to say so I apologize if 
some of this is repetitive, but I really think this is an awesome topic (good 
job, Tru : )) and especially with the NBA playoffs being in full swing, I also 
think the timing is rather appropriate, as well.</p> 
<p>While I do follow the NBA a bit, I would consider myself a lukewarm NBA fan 
and on the flipside I would consider myself a scalding hot college basketball 
fan, so I&rsquo;m hardly going to be impartial when posed with the feature post 
question and I think, as others have stated, both arguments (either for college 
championship or NBA title from a coaching standpoint) have their strong points.
</p> 
<p>I guess I would just say that it all depends on where a coach is in his 
professional career and what kind of drive does he have? I would agree that the 
NBA is probably thought of as a move up in ones basketball coaching career and 
I suppose a college coach would have to ask himself the question of &mdash; has 
he conquered all he set out to do and now feels the need to go and conquer the 
next step where there is more money to be made, where the fan bases are larger 
than in college basketball (and as big and far reaching a fan base that UK has, 
I would dare say that the historically great (Celtics, Lakers, etc) NBA teams 
have a considerably greater amount of fans than UK) and are the larger markets 
that most of what I would consider to be the better NBA jobs (that&rsquo;s why 
they are the better NBA jobs, because of the markets they are in, IMO) and what 
they can offer appeal to him at that particular time in his life?</p> 
<p>I have no idea as to the answers, but I will say this, timing is everything 
and things do change over time. Ones goals, desires, health, and a plethora of 
other things can change in an individual&rsquo;s life resulting in a desire for 
career change.</p> 
<p>To think that the college ranks and arguably the best job in college 
basketball (and that&rsquo;s not just the UK homer in me talking, either, 
RhinoDawg says the same thing above : )) well, to think that this is the end of 
the line for Calipari and it&rsquo;s all that he aspires for, and I&rsquo;m not 
saying anyone here is totally behind that thinking, but to me that is a bit 
unrealistic.</p>

<h5> National titles, John Wall, Washington Bullets, Wizards </h5> 
<p>First, I have to correct you. It was the Washington Bullets, not the 
Baltimore Bullets who won the NBA title in &rsquo;78. They still exist, they 
are now the Wizards. In fact, former Kentucky All American Kevin Grevey started 
on that Bullets championship team:</p>

</p> 
<p>I should have asked him which he would rather have had, an NCAA title or an 
NBA title. he lost in the NCAA title game in &rsquo;75 to UCLA and the loss 
still burns him, though he scored 34 points.</p> 
<p>Which is better &ndash; an NCAA or NBA title? I think they&rsquo;re equal 
but judging by the way New Yorkers treated Patrick Ewing, it&rsquo;s as if they 
forgot he won a national championship in college.</p> 
<p>Speaking of Kentucky players and the Washington Wizards, John Wall should 
help return the franchise to prominence:

.</p> 
<p>People here in DC are giddy over the chance to get Wall. He&rsquo;s now 
part of the city&rsquo;s big three, along with Alexander Ovechkin and Stephen 
Strasburg, all number one picks.</p> 
<p>Trivia &ndash; a couple of other Wildcats played for the Bullets &ndash; 
Mel Turpin and Kenny Sky Walker. I&rsquo;m sure there are others.</p> 
<p>Back to the question, in this area, I&rsquo;d say the reaction to the 
Bullets winning the NBA title and Maryland winning the NCAA title in 2002 was 
about the same.</p> 
<p>Finally, the Wizards are going to trade Gilbert Arenas, sign LeBron James, 
and Calipari will come to Washington.</p> 
<p>just kidding about that last sentence!</p>
