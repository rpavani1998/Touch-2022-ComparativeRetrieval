<p>It was brought to my attention by Bruins Nation that Rivals.com recently 
ranked college athletics programs based upon their combined success at 
baseball, basketball and football.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Rivals.com&rsquo;s methodology was somewhat confusing---the formula, for 
instance, states contradictorily that a team gets five points for a third- or 
fourth-place finish in the College World Series but receives three points for 
the selfsame third- or fourth-place finish in the College World Series---but, 
assuming that we are all agreed thatintercollegiate athletics are superior to 
professional sports, I thought it was worth exploring how the Bulldogs fared 
according to these rankings.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Rivals.com reports that Georgia ranks 17th overall since 1974, half a point 
behind No. 16 Notre Dame. The &lsquo;Dawgs and the Irish were tied with 65 
points apiece in football, but Notre Dame&rsquo;s eight straight N.C.A.A. 
tournament appearances from 1999 to 2006 boosted the Golden Domers to 28 points 
in men&rsquo;s basketball, whereas the Red and Black&rsquo;s 25-year-old Final 
Four berth got Georgia only as far as 12 points. The Classic City Canines made 
up the difference with 32.5 points in baseball, far more than the 17 the Irish 
received on the strength of their 2002 trip to Omaha.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In the three biggest sports in the B.C.S. era, Florida finished third, 
Louisiana State fourth, Tennessee eighth, Georgia Tech eleventh, Alabama 
twelfth, Auburn 13th, and Arkansas 20th, butGeorgia did not make the top 20 
since 1998.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It is not hard to see where the deficiency lies. On the gridiron, the 
Bulldogs aretied for eleventh since 1974 and tied for ninth since 1998. On the 
diamond, the Red and Black arethe country&rsquo;s twelfth-best team over the 
last decade. On the hardwood, however, the Classic City Canines are nowhere to 
be found.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I believe my position on basketball has been made abundantly clear: it is 
an important sport and I understand why fans of it enjoy it as much as they do, 
but I personally regard it with something approximating indifference.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Surveys like this one, however, explain why it matters to me to see Georgia 
improve at men&rsquo;s basketball. AsI wrote last March:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p>  It was one thing when S.E.C. basketball was Kentucky, occasionally 
Vanderbilt, and not much of anyone else; then, there was no shame in not being 
very good at something no one outside of the Bluegrass State seemed terribly 
interested in being good at doing.<br>
<br>
 Indeed, there was, in no small 
sense, rather a manly satisfaction to be derived from deriding the neighboring 
A.C.C. as &quot;a basketball conference&quot;---by which was meant, of course,
<i>only</i> a basketball conference, a league that had to settle for being good 
at hoops because it lacked the masculine fortitude to excel on the gridiron. If 
the only way to be good at basketball was to be lousy at football---and, if 
Kentucky, Vanderbilt, and the Atlantic Coast Conference were any indication, 
that certainly seemed to be the case---then who cared about basketball?<br>
<br>
 That began to change around the time Arkansas changed conference allegiances. 
. . .<br>
<br>
 In short, the S.E.C. has gotten good at basketball, too, 
without sacrificing its commitment to quality football. . . .<br>
<br>
 An 
athletics program as prominent as Georgia's, and with as many natural and 
institutional advantages, ought to be good consistently at multiple sports, and 
certainly at the second-most important sport, in terms of money and prestige, 
in intercollegiate competition. My fear is that Dennis's Dogs, motivated by the 
desire to save their coach's imperiled job, played above their heads during a 
whirlwind four-day period in which they didn't have the time to think about the 
impossibility of what they were doing . . . but my hope is that this was the 
breakthrough that will put Georgia basketball on the road to respectability, 
significance, and, ultimately, success at the highest level. 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>If, instead of collecting an anemic 12 points in basketball since 1974, the 
Classic City Canines had amassed 25.5 points---equal to the totals earned by 
Alabama and Oklahoma State in that same span---Georgia would have finished with 
a cumulative 123 points in the three sports combined. That would have been good 
enough to boost the Bulldogs from 17th overall since 1974 to 13th. If Georgia 
had matched Florida&rsquo;s 42 points in basketball during that period, it 
would have put the Bulldogs in the top ten.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>To some extent, of course, these numbers are arbitrary. Georgia&rsquo;s 
2002 S.E.C. championship squad compiled a resume of achievement equal to or 
better than that of more than a couple of the national champions who have been 
crowned since Richard Nixon left office, but the Bulldogs received half as many 
points (5) for Mark Richt&rsquo;s second season in Athens as the Gators 
received for Urban Meyer&rsquo;s altogether comparable second season in 
Gainesville (10).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Even this crude calculation by Rivals.com, however, offers meaningful 
insights into the state of what otherwise isas strong an athletics program as 
any in the conference. The Georgia football program is on top of the world and 
happy about it. David Perno has the Diamond Dogs on sound ground.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s time for our men&rsquo;s basketball program to step it up to the 
next level. No, Georgia basketball doesn&rsquo;t enjoy Kentucky&rsquo;s 
tradition, or even Arkansas&rsquo;s, but there&rsquo;s no reason why the 
Bulldogs can&rsquo;t improve their stature in the sport in the same way Florida 
and Tennessee have in recent years. At a minimum, Mississippi State- or South 
Carolina-level success ought to be a given.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Georgia&rsquo;s sensational run through the S.E.C. tournament last spring 
got us all excited, but the euphoria has worn off and it is time for us to 
expect more than a long weekend&rsquo;s worth of excellence. An early lead over 
Xavier in the Big Dance was a nice baby step, but it is time to begin making 
real strides.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Rivals.com&rsquo;s numbers may be somewhat skewed, but they do not lie at 
the bottom line. The Georgia men&rsquo;s basketball program has been a 
liability and should be a strength. We have passed the point at which progress 
any longer ought to be an expectation; starting next season, it must be made a 
non-negotiable demand.</p>

<h5> Presidents' Cup </h5> 
<p>Any word on the Presidents&rsquo; Cup standings? I know we probably 
can&rsquo;t beat Stanford or UCLA because we don&rsquo;t field teams in water 
polo, wake boarding, beach volley ball, snow skiing, bowling or hacky-sack, but 
we had a pretty amazing run this year with at least 3 National Titles, two #2 
finishes in major sports and a conference championship in our achilles heel, 
basketball.</p>

<h5> As of June 26, the final Directors' Cup standings . . . </h5> 
<p>. . . placed Georgia tenth, behind No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 U.C.L.A., No. 3 
Michigan, No. 4 Arizona State, No. 5 Texas, No. 6 Florida, No. 7 California, 
No. 8 Louisiana State, and No. 9 Penn State, but ahead of No. 11 Ohio State, 
No. 12 Texas A&amp;M, No. 13 Southern California, No. 14 North Carolina, and 
No. 15 Florida State.</p> 
<p>Tennessee finished 16th, Auburn 20th, Arkansas 24th, Alabama 25th, Kentucky 
36th, and South Carolina 48th.</p>

<h5> Thanks </h5> 
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t remember the actual title of the award.</p>

<h5> Standings </h5> 
<p>After looking at the standings, I think UGA should add a women&rsquo;s 
lacrosse or water polo team, whichever is cheaper. There are so few teams, even 
if we stink, we still probably get a #10 ranking and reap some more points. I 
would have suggested men&rsquo;s volleyball, but with Title IX that seems 
unlikely.</p>

<h5> The problem with the Directors' Cup . . . </h5> 
<p>. . . is that it rewards quantity as much as quality.</p> 
<p>If the results were averaged (i.e., if it showed how well a school was 
doing overall in the sports in which it participated) rather than lumped 
together, it would give us a more accurate portrait of how good an athletics 
program a university was running.</p> 
<p>The notion that Stantord is the top sports school in the N.C.A.A. 
isn&rsquo;t just erroneous, it&rsquo;s comical.</p>
