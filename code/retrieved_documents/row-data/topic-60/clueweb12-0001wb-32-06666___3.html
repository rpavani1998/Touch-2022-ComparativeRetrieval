<p></p> A Tribute To Wilt Chamberlain
<p>The most exhaustive page on the internet dedicated to the greatest player 
in NBA history.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
 This is my tribute to the basketball 
legend, Wilt Chamberlain.&nbsp; This was my second website.&nbsp; I made this 
nearly a year and half before he died (and even got an e-mail from him thanking 
me for it!).&nbsp; After he died, I overhauled it.&nbsp; It was featured on 
Yahoo on the news story about his death.&nbsp; That got this site a BUNCH of 
hits (1000 before he died, 50,000 during 3 months after he died).&nbsp; This is 
the only site I have that features a guest book.&nbsp; And no, I don't ask that 
you sign it.&nbsp; It is for those who wanted to share a Wilt thought or 
story.&nbsp; <br>

<p></p> <strong>The Exposers of jordon's&nbsp; Foolishness</strong>
<p>My controversial, award-winning site that exposes the clay feet of the tin 
god Michael jordon.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>This is my pride and joy section.&nbsp; It was my first attempt at web page 
design -- ahhh!&nbsp; The good old days.&nbsp; This section is also the one 
that I have dedicated by FAR the most time to.&nbsp; It contains the Java 
Applets and Java script that I have learned.&nbsp; It contains interactive 
sections as well, and most of my graphics work.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 It is part 
truth with a humorous twist.&nbsp; I grow tired of the hype of the media, 
saying he is &quot;without a doubt the best ever&quot;, instead of, saying that 
he is &quot;one of the best ever.&quot;&nbsp; Because of the unfounded hype, I 
created a webpage using hype in the other extreme, in order to demonstrate the 
absurdity of the press.&nbsp; Therefore, the theme of the site is &quot;Michael 
jordon is a foolish ballhog.&nbsp; His teammates won in spite of him.&nbsp; Not 
only is he the most overrated basketball player in history, and an 
out-of-control megalomaniac.&nbsp; However, he happens to be one of the 
greatest cooks in the world, so this proves that I am unbiased.&quot;&nbsp; If 
you just don't &quot;get it&quot;, then go to the &quot;Political agenda&quot; 
section and read how he masterminded the Clinton-Lewinski scandal.&nbsp; One of 
the funniest parts is how people take it so seriously, so for added humorous 
benefit, Iprint the hate mail and the praise mail.&nbsp; It is just priceless 
how some people just don't &quot;get it.&quot;&nbsp; (and how many tell me, 
&quot;You can't spell his name right!&quot;)</p> 
<p>I don't update this site very much anymore.&nbsp; Making fun of him in his 
current job as part-owner of the Washington Wizards is just too easy.&nbsp; 
There is no challenge.&nbsp; It's like shooting fish in a barrel.&nbsp; I may 
remove the frames someday, but for now, I can't think of an easier way to 
navigate the 75+ html document related to it.</p> <br>

<p></p> Why Jordan is NOT the greatest
<p>The sister page to the Exposers of jordon's Foolishness page.&nbsp; 
Stripped down, just-the-facts site that shows why Michael Jordan is not the 
greatest basketball player ever.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>This is a bare-bones, all-facts/no humor site.&nbsp; My <i>Exposers of 
jordon's Foolishness Site</i> was a lot of fun, but some people thought that 
because of the humor, that it completely lacked in factual information (due to 
the obviously absurd parts).&nbsp; As a result, I created this alternate, 
smaller site to prove what I said before: Jordan is good, but you cannot say 
with certainty that he is without a doubt, the greatest ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You don't hear any baseball or football player called the best ever.&nbsp; 
Why basketball?&nbsp; Because basketball has degenerated from a serious sport 
into an entertainment business, and Jordan, while he was a great player, was an 
even better entertainer.&nbsp; Greatest entertainer?&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Greatest 
basketball player?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The two should not be combined.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don't care if you think Michael Jordan is the 2nd greatest player of 
all-time.&nbsp; I don't care if you think that Wilt Chamberlain is<i>not </i>
the greatest player ever.&nbsp; I don't care if think he is better than 
Chamberlain and somebody else is better than both of them.&nbsp; This site has 
only one purpose: to show that no matter what criteria is used, Michael Jordan 
is not the greatest player ever.&nbsp; He maybe #2, #20, or #2000, but he is 
not #1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you think he is <i>in your opinion</i>, that is fine, but I simply ask 
that you first define your criteria for judging players, and then I will show 
that your very own criteria does not support the conclusion that Jordan is 
#1.&nbsp; When people call him the<i>best ever</i>, it becomes obvious that 
they don't understand<i>ever</i>, because they lack knowledge of basketball 
history.</p> 
<p>This is not some &quot;I hate Jordan&quot; page.&nbsp; He makes my all-time 
all-NBA team.&nbsp; I am simply sick of the media worshipping him and holding 
him to a lesser standard than others are held to.&nbsp; When you even the 
playing field, you see that he is not the best.</p> <br>
