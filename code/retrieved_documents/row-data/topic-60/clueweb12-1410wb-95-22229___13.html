<b>Kid's 
sports go on and on.&nbsp; Time out, please</b><br>
<br>
<b></b><br>
<br>
There 
once were three scholastic seasons: football, basketball and baseball.&nbsp; 
Each happily owned a three-month segment of the school year.&nbsp; And it was 
good - for the kids. Sports were under the umbrella and protection of the 
educational system.&nbsp; There were rules about a schedule cap.&nbsp; 
Professionally trained educators ran the programs.&nbsp; Then there came soccer.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
Soccer is an import.&nbsp; Here was a game that relied on 
the feet.&nbsp; Minimal contact made it appealing to moms.&nbsp; But four 
sports in three seasons made it impossible to play them all. At first, few 
schools incorporated it into their sports program.&nbsp; There were few 
qualified coaches and football schools weren't going to let soccer get on the 
field in the fall.&nbsp; Then someone somewhere had the idea to play in the 
spring, like they do in Europe.&nbsp; Then someone somewhere wondered why kid's 
couldn't play baseball well into the fall.&nbsp; All hell broke loose and a 
kid's nightmare began.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Because schools were slow to embrace 
soccer as part of the scholastic program, parents decided to organize, coach, 
and manage soccer teams for their kids.&nbsp; There were a few foreign-born 
parents around who had played soccer before coming to the states.&nbsp; Soccer 
is an international sport and American football is not.&nbsp; Football is a 
rough sport where size matters.&nbsp; Helmets, shoulder pads, and all that 
other equipment required to be worn by a football player is expensive.&nbsp; In 
comparison, soccer is dirt cheap. &nbsp; And parents, not school 
administrators, are running the whole show.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Even as schools 
began to add soccer to their athletic programs it was initially treated at most 
places as a second-class, minor sport.&nbsp; Football coaches were reluctant to 
allow soccer on their fields, even in the spring.&nbsp; Passionate soccer 
parents quickly labeled football as the enemy.&nbsp; And soccer in the US 
quickly became a cult rather than a sport.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We now have 
basically four levels of soccer: scholastic, recreational, travel, and 
premier.&nbsp; The latter three are now playing year round and the leaders 
strongly encourage kids to specialize in soccer.&nbsp; Travel and premier teams 
play in tournaments all around the country.&nbsp; They are not restricted to a 
schedule cap as are school teams.&nbsp; Club teams - the non-scolastic teams - 
now have parents funding coaches and travel.&nbsp; The birth of the ODP, 
Olympic Development Program, has become the center stage of American 
soccer.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Travel teams require kids as early as nine 
years old (and their parents) to visit other towns, often hours away, to play 
against regional teams from other places.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We 
have no weekends,&quot; complains Jack R., a Connecticut father whose son plays 
on a travel team in the fall.&nbsp; The family shuttles from playing field to 
playing field, carrying a complicated assortment of Gatorade, Dunkin Munchkins 
and changes of clothing.&nbsp; Jack wonders what happened to the simple 
pleasures of leisurely Sundays and fallow seasons.&nbsp; It's not as if his 
generation did not play ball year-round.&nbsp; But their games consisted of 
stickball or whiffle-ball or even pickup baseball without the pressure of 
teams, leagues and coaches.&nbsp; Instead of being in Sunday school and church 
on Sundays, parents and kids are on a soccer field miles and miles from 
home.&nbsp; Soccer is the religion.&nbsp; Families suffer.&nbsp; Kids are 
abused.&nbsp; Parent egos runs the show.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But let's don't 
just blame the soccer fanatics.&nbsp; There are kids as young as nine years old 
who play 60+ baseball or softball games in the summer.&nbsp; There are now 
personal trainers - pitching coaches and hitting coaches who charge big bucks 
to give kids personal instruction between games.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While 
baseball tries to accommodate soccer's schedule in the fall and soccer tries to 
accommodate baseball's in the spring, conflicts inevitably arise that prevent 
kids from playing both sports at the same time.&nbsp; And while nothing 
prevents a child from trying out for a travel soccer team in one season after 
playing baseball in the other, his skills probably won't keep pace with his 
peers who are in soccer year-round.&nbsp; The cult is not prone to share with 
anyone.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
High school soccer teams suffer as well.&nbsp; 
Travel and premier leagues can draw kids who otherwise might be on their school 
varsity squad.&nbsp; This obviously draws ire from school coaches and peers who 
play for the school team.&nbsp; As the prestige of travel teams run by parents 
and not educators grows, scholastic sports become trivial with the best 
athletes opting out of the school program.&nbsp; Soccer is a cult, not a 
sport.&nbsp; Kids lose another one.&nbsp; Defeated my adult egos.&nbsp; For 
what?&nbsp;<br>

<b>Kids: Soccer</b>
<br> <br>
<b>Comments from a reader:</b><br>
<br>
High school soccer and 
college soccer are a farce.&nbsp; Club soccer adheres to the established rules 
of the game around the world.&nbsp; The NCAA and NFHS alter the rules of the 
game willy nilly in order to 'Americanize' the game.&nbsp; Scholastic soccer 
limits the amount of games players can play during the years in which it is 
most crucial for developing players to play as much as possible.&nbsp; 
Specifically in Kansas, the Kansas High School Activities Association limits 
high school boys players from participating in club soccer with its 'six player 
rule' which bans more than six members of the same high school team from 
playing on the same club team.&nbsp; The result is that high school teams in 
small towns in rural areas are severely limited in their ability to compete 
with schools from the large urban and suburban areas since those players simply 
cannot form club teams without running afoul of the six player rule.&nbsp; 
Therefore the overall development of the gam e is stifled in areas where most 
people are very protective of the 'traditional sports', especially 
football.&nbsp; Curiously, the Kansas association has no six player rule for 
girls...who don't threaten football's popularity.&nbsp; Scholastic/collegiate 
associations place these restrictions on soccer NOT to keep the games in the 
&quot;proper educational perspective&quot; but rather to prevent soccer from 
receiving equivalent exposure to that of the 'revenue' or 'traditional' sports 
of Football/Basketball/Baseball.&nbsp; If that's not the case, explain the 
continued expansion of the Bowl Championship Series and the NCAA Basketball 
tournaments in addition to more regular season games in both football and 
basketball.&nbsp; The NCAA has actually used Title IX to decrease the number of 
men's college soccer programs available, while the USSF, which is not legally 
bound by Title IX has greatly expanded the opportunities for women and girls to 
play soccer without decreasing opportunitie s for men and boys.&nbsp; If 
scholastic/collegiate athletic associations don't want the USSF to encourage 
its players not to play scholastic/collegiate soccer, maybe those associations 
should think about cooperating with soccer's true governing body instead of 
trying to undermine it.&nbsp; Soccer is a superior activity to american 
football and anyone who can't understand why is proof of why.<br>

<b>Charlie's reply:</b><br>
<br>
Hello, 
James.&nbsp; Well you are talking to the wrong guy here.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Any child psychologist will tell you that specializing in a sport in 
middle school/high school is not good for the physical or emotional development 
of the child.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Club soccer is all about the individual and 
not the team concept.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Club soccer has no academic rules for 
participation.&nbsp; In fact the ODP manual states that missing an ODP practice 
because of a school event is an unexcused absense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
High 
school athletic associations have a desire to protect young athletes from 
exploitation by folks who drain kids physically and emotionally by playing far 
too many soccer matches or baseball and softball games a year.&nbsp; Frankly, 
club soccer is all about the adults, not the kids.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Club 
coaches lie like Hell to parents.&nbsp; &quot;If Johnny plays for me 
year-round, he will get a college scholarship&quot;.&nbsp; Bull Shit!&nbsp; ODP 
is a lying joke...reel those parents in and make some money.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

And club soccer &quot;develops&quot; players for who / what??&nbsp; An advanced 
CLUB travel team, where parents have to spent $5,000 instead of $3,000 for 
their kid to get abused.&nbsp; I've never wittnessed as much verbal abuse 
anywhere else in sports than at a Club soccer match.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is 
the mission of the USSF? ...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why have a USSF?&nbsp; Why 
isn't school participation enough? ... because there are folks out there making 
money through USSF by preying on the hopes of parents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When 
college soccer programs start putting 80,000 folks in the stands for a match, 
then I'm sure soccer will take its proper place in AMERICAN sports.&nbsp; 
Nobody needs to &quot;protect&quot; football.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At least 
schools don't play any sport year round.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, James.&nbsp;

Any child psychologist will tell you 
that specializing in a sport in middle<br>
<br>
school/high school is not good 
for the physical or emotional development of<br>
<br>
the child.<br>
<br>
Any 
of them?&nbsp; Probably one or two wouldn't say that.&nbsp; Anyway, is it just
<br> <br>
sports or do they think any sort of specialization in the teen years 
too<br>
<br>
limiting, like the child who plays cello all the time or who 
spends his/her<br>
<br>
entire free time building robots?&nbsp; Don't sports, 
especially if it's many<br>
<br>
sports -- limit a child from experiencing the 
arts?&nbsp; The thing is, life is<br>
<br>
limiting.&nbsp; There is not enough 
time to do everything, even in childhood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Club soccer is all 
about the individual and not the team concept.<br>
<br>
My child has learned a 
lot about sportsmanship and team playing in his<br>
<br>
soccer club 
league.&nbsp; It has carried over into his school league according to<br>
<br>

comments from his school coach.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Club soccer has no academic 
rules for participation.&nbsp; In fact the ODP manual<br>
<br>
states that 
missing an ODP practice because of a school event is an<br>
<br>
unexcused 
absense.<br>
<br>
There are no academic rules for going to the movies either, 
but my child<br>
<br>
isn't going if he hasn't done his homework.&nbsp; That's 
a parental issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
High school athletic associations have a 
desire to protect young athletes<br>
<br>
from exploitation by folks who drain 
kids physically and emotionally by<br>
<br>
playing far too many soccer matches 
or baseball and softball games a year.<br>
<br>
Frankly, club soccer is all 
about the adults, not the kids.<br>
<br>
Why do you feel high school athletic 
associations want to protect young<br>
<br>
athletes and club athletic 
associations want to exploit young athletes?&nbsp; Is<br>
<br>
there some study 
or research showing this?&nbsp; Do the high school athletic<br>
<br>

associations realize they are &quot;protecting young athletes&quot; from their 
own<br>
<br>
parents?&nbsp; That's the way it appears in your presentation.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
Club coaches lie like Hell to parents.&nbsp; &quot;If Johnny 
plays for me year-round,<br>
<br>
he will get a college 
scholarship&quot;.&nbsp; Bull Shit!&nbsp; ODP is a lying joke...reel<br>
<br>

those parents in and make some money.<br>
<br>
I have never been told by any 
coach that my middle school child would get a<br>
<br>
college scholarship and 
would be highly suspicious of any who did.&nbsp; As<br>
<br>
should any parent 
with any sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And club soccer &quot;develops&quot; players 
for who / what??&nbsp; An advanced CLUB travel<br>
<br>
team, where parents 
have to spent $5,000 instead of $3,000 for their kid to<br>
<br>
get 
abused.&nbsp; I've never wittnessed as much verbal abuse anywhere else in<br>

<br> sports than at a Club soccer match.<br>
<br>
The &quot;development&quot; 
of my middle school soccer player has included increased<br>
<br>
stamina, 
increased soccer skills, better sportsmanship in both winning and<br>
<br>

losing, development of self control in the face of unfair referee calls.<br>

<br> This &quot;development&quot; is for my son, not for anyone else.&nbsp; If 
my child was ever<br>
<br>
verbally abused by a coach, I'd ask him if he wanted 
to stay on the team and<br>
<br>
yank him out if he didn't.&nbsp; I suspect 
that most parents are protective of<br>
<br>
their children in the same 
way.&nbsp; Verbally abusive coaches, in any sport,<br>
<br>
won't last long 
where the parents are involved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is the mission of the 
USSF? ...<br>
<br>
To play soccer games.&nbsp; Just as the mission of the NFL 
is to play football.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why have a USSF?&nbsp; Why isn't school 
participation enough? ... because there<br>
<br>
are folks out there making 
money through USSF by preying on the hopes of<br>
<br>
parents.<br>
<br>
Boy, 
parents sure are stupid.&nbsp; Thank goodness the government is here to<br>
<br>
protect our children for/from us.&nbsp; At least, that seems to be your view.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
When college soccer programs start putting 80,000 folks in 
the stands for a<br>
<br>
match, then I'm sure soccer will take its proper 
place in AMERICAN sports.<br>
<br>
Nobody needs to &quot;protect&quot; football.
<br> <br>
My child is 13.&nbsp; I don't have any experience with college 
soccer.&nbsp; My<br>
<br>
experience with soccer has been that the schools 
wouldn't pick it up as a<br>
<br>
sport, so a local recreational league was 
developed by parents for their<br>
<br>
children who love soccer.&nbsp; We play 
on a field without bleachers, with a<br>
<br>
port-a-potty, with no concessions 
stand.&nbsp; For some reason, only parents show<br>
<br>
up to watch, to hike a 
1/4 mile from the gravel parking lot, carrying a<br>
<br>
cooler and a 
chair.&nbsp; There's greater attendance at the football games,<br>
<br>
BECAUSE 
they are school sponsered and have a decent place to play.&nbsp; Yet,<br>
<br>

more local kids here play soccer than any other single sport, except<br>
<br>

baseball (which, by the way, is club baseball).&nbsp; It's not soccer players 
and<br>
<br>
their families who are &quot;cultish.&quot;&nbsp; It's the school 
system that won't accept<br>
<br>
a new sport for fear that they'd have to cut 
back on a traditional sport.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At least schools don't play any 
sport year round.<br>
<br>
My 13 year old can pick whatever sport he wants to 
play.&nbsp; My requirement is<br>
<br>
that he have some regularly scheduled 
athletic activity, to keep him<br>
<br>
healthy.&nbsp; He picks soccer, year 
round.&nbsp; He's tried baseball, track and<br>
<br>
basketball.&nbsp; He loves 
soccer more than any other sport, although he'll play<br>
<br>
a pick-up game 
with neighborhood kids on any sport at any time.&nbsp; My friend's<br>
<br>

football playing boys played football in the fall and they extended the<br>
<br>
season into the winter.&nbsp; Then they added summer 
&quot;conditioning.&quot;&nbsp; Then they<br>
<br>
added spring 
&quot;conditioning.&quot;&nbsp; The games aren't year round, but the practices
<br> <br>
sure are.&nbsp; OMG, they're probably a cult of crazy parents who 
don't care<br>
<br>
about their children.&nbsp; I'll alert the media.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
Sorry, James.&nbsp; You ranted to the wrong guy on this subject.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
Rant is right.&nbsp; Your primary assumptions seem to be 1. 
Parents are stupid.<br>
<br>
2. Parents don't have a thought about their 
children's development, just<br>
<br>
scholarships and winning games.&nbsp; 3. 
Middle and high school age children have<br>
<br>
no say in what sport they 
play -- the parents decide.&nbsp; 4. The more<br>
<br>
organized, 
school-sponsered sports a kid plays, the better.&nbsp; 5. Soccer clubs<br>
<br>

are parent-focused, not player-focused.&nbsp; However, baseball, football and
<br> <br>
basketball clubs are player-focused.&nbsp; 6. Soccer clubs want to 
rule the<br>
<br>
world.&nbsp; Baseball, football, and basketball clubs just 
wanna have fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
