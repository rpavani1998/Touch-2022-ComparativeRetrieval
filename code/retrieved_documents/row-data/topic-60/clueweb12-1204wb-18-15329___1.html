<h3>Why Baseball is Better than Football</h3> 
<p>Hope springs eternal. Tomorrow is the first day of baseball Spring 
training. There has never been a year when we so desperately need baseball. 
Football is over, basketball--well, can anyone name more than about five 
players anymore, and hockey has a death wish, with the rest of the season about 
to be cancelled.</p> 
<p>This year, baseball returns to the Nation's Capital, and one of the 
nation's best sports writers,Thomas Boswell, is as enthused as he can be. </p> 
<p>As a salute to the beginning of Spring training, here's the classic (1987) 
Boswell piece:Why Is Baseball So Much Better Than Football? (h/t: Daddypundit).

 I know, I know, I'm playing with a Ben Franklin quote about 
beer, but times, change! Had baseball been around when Ben Franklin was air 
bathing and enjoying a brew, he'd agree with me.[Read More] </p>

<p>Baseball...</p> 
<p>This is my passion. I love the game. I love the crack of the ball on the 
bat, the twack of the leather as the catcher takes in a 90 mph ball...</p> 
<p>Sigh. </p> 
<p>Baseball is God's way of telling us that he loves us and he wants us to be 
happy! :-)</p>

<p>Spring training is part of what makes baseball unique. People who during 
the normal season barely have contact with the fans are within a closer setting 
and much more relaxed and open to communicating. Even those who are considered 
huge, take the quiet moment to sign autographs and say &quot;hi&quot;. I've 
been to spring training games in Phoenix and in some ways, I like them better 
than the main event. It's just more personal.</p>

baseball.&quot;</p>

<p>I can name well over 5 basketball players... (I could probably name at 
least 2 players from each team.) but I can only name about 3 baseball players.
</p> 
<p>But hey, watch whatever sport appeals to you. Long live sport!</p>
