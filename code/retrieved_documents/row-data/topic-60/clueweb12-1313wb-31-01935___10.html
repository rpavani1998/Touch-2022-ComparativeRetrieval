<p>Officials from what&rsquo;s left of the Big East&rsquo;s dwindling football 
membership had another conference call on Tuesday morning and there remains no 
specific timetable on adding UCF, but &ldquo;appears an invitation is 
forthcoming&rdquo; for the Knights, the league&rsquo;s No. 1 target.</p> 
<p>The presidents, chancellors and athletic directors continued to discuss 
potential expansion candidates. Among those mentioned were UCF, Air Force, 
Navy, Temple, Houston, SMU and Boise State, a league source told CBSSports.com.
</p> 
<p>While Commissioner John Marinatto said in a statement Monday the league 
would consider a model with 12 football members, part of Tuesday&rsquo;s call 
was discussing the possibility of splitting the football and basketball 
conference into divisions, once the football side is replenished.</p> 
<p>Navy, Air Force and Boise State are being considered as football members 
only, while UCF, Temple, Houston and SMU are at the top of the list as 
all-sports members so it&rsquo;s unknown right now how large the basketball 
membership could grow.</p> 
<p>The Newark Star-Ledger reported one proposed alignment discussed at 
Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting consisted of Rutgers, UConn, South Florida, UCF, Temple 
and Navy in an East Division with West Virginia, Louisville, Cincinnati, Air 
Force, SMU and Houston in a West Division.</p> 
<p>However, there remains the very real possibility Louisville and West 
Virginia may not be in the league and bound for the Big 12 if Missouri leaves 
for the SEC or the Big 12 expands to 12 teams.</p> 
<p>What make Temple, SMU and Houston attractive to the Big East, one source 
said, is their respective television markets. Philadelphia (Temple) is the 
nation&rsquo;s No. 4 market, Dallas (SMU) is No. 5 and Houston is No. 10.</p> 
<p>Beyond Navy, Air Force and UCF, a league source said &ldquo;no one team is 
definitely next&rdquo; as an expansion candidate.</p> 
<p>There also appears to be conflicting opinions on pursuing Boise State. Some 
league members support adding Boise State because of the Broncos&rsquo; recent 
success, which would help the league with its future BCS status. However, 
others believe Boise State, located nearly 700 miles west of Air Force and 
nearly 2,200 miles from Tampa/USF, is simply too far to consider.</p> 
<p>Boise State president Bob Kustra said in a statement Monday that the 
Broncos &ldquo;are looking forward to their inaugural season&rdquo; in the 
Mountain West Conference and he &ldquo;has great confidence in the future 
direction of the Mountain West.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with 
other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus 
is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped 
make Boise State a popular and compelling national brand,&quot; Kustra said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we 
are continuing to monitor the situation.&nbsp;We are confident that Boise State 
will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status 
with the best interests of the entire university in mind.&nbsp;Boise 
State&rsquo;s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, 
popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely 
valuable conference partner.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A league source also told CBSSports.com that Army is no longer being 
considered as a candidate by the Big East. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been honest 
with us and that they&rsquo;re not interested because of the challenges they 
had previously in Conference USA,&rdquo; the source said.</p> 
<p>Army was in C-USA from 1998-2004. The Cadets were 9-41 in C-USA play and 
finished last in the league five of the seven seasons.</p>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Liontime has it right, 
the federal government funds the service academies try pulling their AQ bid 
unless you want congress to investigate the entire system. Southern Miss has 
been to 8 straight bowl games and ECU 5 a claim that only 20 other programs can 
make yet they both appear to be on the outside looking in. One day its market 
size, the next attendence, the next something else. How about putting the best 
64 teams out there and see what happens on the field not in some board room 
where a bunch of fools try to carve up a pie on the backs of kids that in many 
cases could not get into the university the represent. The game is being 
destroyed before our eyes. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  One thing nobody is 
talking about is the strategic aspect of adding the service academies.&nbsp; 
Does anyone think the BCS will get away with yanking the AQ status of the 
conference Navy and Air Force are in one year after joining?&nbsp; I don't know 
if anyone is thinking about it this way, but I sure would not want to be the 
BCS president having to explain that one to say Congress. <br>

&quot;Can someone please explain why East Carolina is on the outside looking 
in? &nbsp;Top 3 attendance outside the AQ schools. &nbsp;Big untapped TV market 
of Raleigh, TideWater and Charlotte. Strong facilities and a strong out of 
conference schedule year in year out. &nbsp;SMU and UCF are riding a high and 
at the moment ECU is in flux. &nbsp;This stinks just like 03-04 expansion. 
&quot;<br>
<br>
ECU does bring in lots of fans to the stadium for sure.&nbsp; 
That does not translate into bringing in other markets however.&nbsp; Other 
than in Greenville (small market) ECU would not bring in other NC markets 
unless they were going to a BCS game.&nbsp; Nobody in Tidewater (Norfolk/Va 
Beach) knows who they are ....that is VT territory (more than UVA).&nbsp; I 
love the Pirates and I agree they are getting a raw deal.&nbsp; They are better 
at FB than many of the other schools but it is about location...why is nobody 
mentioning Southern Miss?&nbsp; They are very much like ECU, great FB tradition 
but location stinks.&nbsp; UCF is a good fit.&nbsp; Houston is a good 
fit.&nbsp; AF and Navy also are good fits (not so much geographically for 
AF).&nbsp; Maybe even Temple is a fit.&nbsp; They all bring in pretty big TV 
markets and some bring in good BB as well (Houston and Temple).&nbsp;<br>
<br>

I am pulling for ECU.<br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Not really sure how 
Tampa&nbsp; has helped, have you won the Big East? Tampa Fans are fickle 
anyhow, If the day is sunny people are at the beach on the boat. Even in the 
hight of the Buc's superbowl run they could not fill the stadium. The Rays won 
the AL East, and the Al Championship and they beg the fans to show up. Tampa is 
not much for sports anyhow. So im not sure how the Bulls have helped the 
conference either<br>

both historic basketball teams teams. all of the other 4 teams added should be

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  FIU would be a better 
addition than UCF. At least FIU brings the Miami area.<br>
<br>
I also don't 
buy the argument that UCF would &quot;improve&quot; in an AQ conference. Big 
deal. A lot of teams would improve in an AQ conference.&nbsp; FIU is in perhaps 
one of the best recruiting areas in the nation, you don't think they would 
improve if they had all the money that being in an AQ conference brings?&nbsp; 
Same thing regarding fan support. They'd get more fan turnout playing against 
teams like WVU, USF, and Louisville than they would playing the likes of Troy, 
UL-Lafayette, and North Texas.<br>
<br>
Joining a BCS conference isn't about 
how that conference can help your school. It's about how your school can help 
the BCS conference.<br>
