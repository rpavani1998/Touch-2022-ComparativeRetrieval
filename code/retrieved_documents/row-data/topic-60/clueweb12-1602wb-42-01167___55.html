<h3>Miami can grab Martin, U-turn program if it&nbsp;commits</h3> 
<p>This article is not exactly a positive development.</p> 
<p>Frank could quash all of this speculation pretty quickly. But he's not 
doing interviews with local media.</p> 
<p>This is how the game is played. Let others tell the national media stuff 
like this while you say all the right things. It practically begs Miami to make 
an offer.</p> 
<p>The only question at this point is whether Frank's just trying to get a 
raise and/or put pressure on ADJC, or really does want the Miami job.</p>

<h5> It's probably worth noting that Gary Parrish was one of the first to call 
both Mike Anderson to Arkansas and Matt Painter to stay at Purdue. </h5> 
<p>Even while other national media were busy getting it wrong.</p> 
<p>Just saying. I&rsquo;d love to know who the &ldquo;walk on coals&rdquo; 
source is. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s Art.</p>

<h5> Didn't Art say in the other article that Frank wouldn't come to Miami 
</h5> 
<p>because they lack the fan support, etc that he loves at KSU?</p> 
<p>Frank&rsquo;s team is definitely playing this well. And I don&rsquo;t blame 
him for that. He&rsquo;s not going to say &ldquo;never&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s 
possible Miami could finally offer a huge contract or increase an existing 
offer that is not being made public at the moment.</p> 
<p>Still confident Frank will stay. Not because of Frank being so loyal to 
KState (although I think he does love it in Manhattan), but because I have no 
confidence in Miami getting it together to make the commitment and offer 
necessary.</p>

<h5> I actually DO blame Frank for this, if his team is behind this nonsense. 
</h5> 
<p>And if Miami throws $3mil/year at him and he takes that POS job, after 
everything he&rsquo;s said about loyalty, then I&rsquo;m done ever believing 
anything that comes out of the mouth of a college basketball coach.</p> 
<p>Innovators look at the same thing as everyone else, yet see something

<h5> Agreed. </h5> 
<p>The idea that the Miami job, even with a &ldquo;commitment to the 
basketball program&rdquo; and including a large financial incentive would be a 
better spot for Martin (even with his ties to Miami) than what he&rsquo;s got 
here, is asinine. His assistants make more than some head coaches, fan support 
is constant and consistent, administrative support has been excellent, and 
there&rsquo;s the whole issue of that new basketball training facility. If he 
leaves Manhattan for non-competitive salaries, dismal fan support at all times, 
competition with pro sports, an administration that looks at basketball as a 
third-tier sport, and aging/run down facilities, I will be flabbergasted. Also 
sad.</p> 
<p>All we can hope is that he&rsquo;s just playing for more money&hellip;I 
kind of thought he wasn&rsquo;t that type of person to begin with (leveraging 
outside developments to get a pay raise a year after you sign a new contract) , 
but I understand the incentive to get as much as you can when you can.</p> 
<p>From a legal perspective though (and not really having anything to do with 
him going to Miami), it was shortsighted of the school to give so many clauses 
in his contract that would allow him to renegotiate. It should have been 
limited to any of:<br>
 1. A top finish in the Big 12<br>
 2. Coach of the Year 
(conference/national)<br>
 3. Winning the Big 12 Tourney<br>
 4. Performance in 
the NCAA Tournament (probably Sweet 16 or higher)</p>

<h5> He'll keep saying what he's been saying. </h5> 
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing squash because no one from Miami has called him.</p>

<p>about how he actually liked the fact that it&rsquo;s perfectly okay for a 
school to talk to a coach&rsquo;s<em>agent</em> before even requesting 
permission to talk to the coach, because that way he knows that if 
they&rsquo;re requesting permission, the deal&rsquo;s already done?</p>

<h5> I semi called this last night </h5> 
<p>Parrish said in his article: &quot; All Miami has to do is secure the funds 
and make the call.&quot; Were will Miami get that kind of money?<br>
 Did you 
see my comment in a fanpost last night to the effect that if<br>
 Frank leaves, 
it will be because of back channel money being funneled to Miami?<br>
 The 
whole thing with Missouri hiring Haith was the tip off. No way they hire that 
clown<br>
 unless the big boys wanted to get Frank out of Manhattan. (no, I 
haven&rsquo;t eaten<br>
 any magic mushrooms in months). <br>

today that permission has been granted for Martin to talk to Miami.</p>

<h5> Well, 810's full of shit. </h5> 
<p>No such thing has happened.</p> 
<p>Until I hear a credible report (read: an actual journalist) that Frank is 
even on Miami&rsquo;s list, I&rsquo;m going with Katz&rsquo;s report and simple 
logic &mdash; Miami won&rsquo;t make the financial commitment necessary to 
attract Martin because it&rsquo;s never cared about basketball.</p>

<h5> No, I just think he's saying Mizzou poached Frank Haith at least 
partially to rid themselves of Frank Martin. </h5> 
<p>IMO, it&rsquo;s a funny joke. It is not even a remotely sound conspiracy 
theory, however.</p> 
<p> by BracketCat on  Apr 8, 2011 2:44 PM CDT up reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> Remember, Life is a series of conspiracies </h5> 
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is this: <br>
 If Miami &ldquo;makes the finacial 
committment to go to get Frank&rdquo;, then<br>
 1. Missouri hiring Haith, who 
was on the HOT seat at Miami, makes no sense, unless,<br>
 2. Some back channel 
money is going to Miami (and probably Missouri) to get Frank out of Manhattan 
and to Miami. Frank has enough charisma to sell big in Miami; the big money 
boys think long term &ndash; they want to develop the college b/ball brand in S 
Florida, and in the Carribbean, Central America, Venezuela, etc. An 8,000 seat 
fieldhouse is irrellevant compared to the other revenue sources. Frank is the 
guy to do it. Missouri profits by getting Frank out of the conference; they 
fire Haith in 2 years, and they won&rsquo;t whiff on their next big name 
flirtation.<br>
 3. If I have to explain where the &ldquo;back channel 
money&rdquo; would come from, then some may be paying to much attention to 96 
field brackets as opposed to who the hell is really pulling the strings in 
college sports these days.<br>
 4. I&rsquo;m not saying that Frank is leaving. 
I&rsquo;m saying if he leaves, there will be back channel money going to Miami 
in order to get the deal done. Does anyone real want to argue with that 
proposition?<br>
 5. Frank likes the bright lights. He likes attention. He 
likes to be on tv. If he turns Miami around, he will go down as a coaching 
legend. Not saying he leaves &ndash; but I won&rsquo;t be surprised if he does.

<h5> I'm not trying to predict what will happen; </h5> 
<p>but if Frank does leave you won&rsquo;t hear me moaning and crying about 
loyalty and other such non-sense. Based on the fact that, at present, Miami is 
a piece of sh*t job, there would have to be some other explanation for his 
leaving than &ldquo;he just wants to go home.&rdquo; If he leaves, Miami is 
going to have to come up with serious money. It does not grow on palm tress, 
even on South Beach. Hence, where did they get the money &mdash; to make the 
guarantees &ndash; to lure Frank away? IF, and I emphasize IF, Frank goes to 
Miami, Missouri was in on it &ndash; I guarantee you. Okay.</p>

<h5> The reason this hasn't been a big deal right now in terms of &quot;Martin 
Gate&quot; </h5> 
<p>is because there is nothing but media speculation. From the reports 
we&rsquo;ve been giving, there has been no contact, no offers, etc. From what 
we know there isn&rsquo;t a 24-hour camera pointing at a door. There 
hasn&rsquo;t been people watching flight records.</p> 
<p>So far, this is just the media thinking out loud about possibilities. 
Parrish&rsquo;s article is based on the premise that Miami has the money 
(I&rsquo;m thinking around an additional $7 million a year with upgrades to 
salaries and general basketball expenses &ndash; not to mention the huge money 
to upgrade/buildi facilities) and the support to do both. Miami can&rsquo;t get 
half their stadium full for a rivalry game? This is NOT a destination job.</p>

<p>If Frank stays and the team is terrible the next three years, would you say 
he should be fired? Loyalty is a two-way street.</p>

<h5> I'm with yeahboozin on this one </h5> 
<p>(And not just because I&rsquo;m often drunk&hellip;)</p> 
<p>Emotionally, we want and value &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo;. Sure, Frank leaves 
and we would take a certain joy in watching Miami stay crappy. (Remember that 
wonderful feeling you had when the Ex ended up ditching the fool who replaced 
you? Oh, rapture!)</p> 
<p>But it&rsquo;s intellectually a bit silly and lazy to a) assume that if 
Frank leaves, he was never loyal; b) think that leaving is an immoral or 
unethical choice; c) claim that K-State and the Wildcats are 
&ldquo;loyal&rdquo; to him, (rather than just valuing a winning coach); or d) 
try to pretend that you wouldn&rsquo;t under any circumstances resign your 
current job to get more money to live where you really, really would rather be 
living.</p> 
<p>a) Frank seems very committed to his players and to the school. But 
that&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t stronger heartstrings that lead 
elsewhere. Even if he were to leave next week&mdash;and I actually don&rsquo;t 
think he will, but I know absolutely nothing about anything&mdash;that 
wouldn&rsquo;t logically negate any sincere emotions he has for Manhattan or 
his players. In Psychology, it&rsquo;s called an &ldquo;approach-approach 
conflict&rdquo;. There are two things you may greatly want and value, and you 
can only have or do one.</p> 
<p>b) Loyal? To who or what? K-State is a large, wealthy institution. We fans 
aren&rsquo;t any different than fans of any other university or pro team. This 
is not a personal relationship (though it does<strong>feel</strong> like that 
at times to many of us). We don&rsquo;t have a marriage contract with Frank. If 
he were to move on, is this different than Seinfeld pulling the plug on his 
show sooner than you would have wished? And, of course, our 
&ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; to Frank is very, very conditional. Which leads me 
to&hellip;</p> 
<p>c) If Frank stays and his next two teams win 17 and 13 games, many of us 
would be calling for his firing. (Some stray elements were actually doing so 
during the January swoon. And note that two comments above, we already have 
someone saying that Frank only cares about money and bemoaning that 
&ldquo;we&rdquo; ever &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; him. And this is based on something 
he hasn&rsquo;t done and possibly never will do.) And beyond that, if we were 
truly loyal to Frank Martin the person, we would all continue to cheer him on 
in Miami and hold a parade if Miami wins the 2013 National Championship. The 
reality is that he ceases to be &ldquo;our guy&rdquo; the moment he leaves, and 
shortly after the program starts to look like it&rsquo;s stagnating. Our 
support of Frank Martin has little to do with &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>d) And finally&mdash;look, it&rsquo;s easy to say that principles are all 
that matter and to castigate those who don&rsquo;t live up to our lofty 
expectations. So, none of us complaining would ever walk out on a job when the 
dream job beckoned? No one ever puts her/his personal needs before those of the 
institution s/he is tied to? And to go a semi-ludicrous step further, we all 
would have stood up to the immoral terror of the Nazis because it was the right 
thing to do, (and sacrificing one&rsquo;s own well-being in the meantime)? I 
don&rsquo;t buy.</p> 
<p>I guess if we all differentiate between our raw emotions&mdash;and yeah, 
I&rsquo;ll be pissed if Frank goes and would end up rooting for Miami to tank 
while the Wildcats move on to the next level&mdash;and claiming some sort of 
moral high ground, this would be a more honest discussion.</p>

<h5> I think you present a false choice </h5> 
<p>Not all fans would support firing Martin before his contract has expired.
</p> 
<p>In fact, I did NOT support the firing of Prince when he was fired, thinking 
at the time that we did not live up to our end of the bargain contract/loyalty 
wise. After the details emerged of his secret contract, well, I have since 
amended my position on that, but I for one am greatly upset when institutions 
fire coaches before their contracts are up. It is a reflection of the 
&ldquo;Me! Me! Me! Now! Now! Now!&rdquo; culture that we have allowed to define 
our society.</p> 
<p>I, for one, do value loyalty, and would not support firing Martin before 
his contract is up, unless he did something outrageous to deserve a firing 
(such as murder, embezzlement, etc.).</p> 
<p>I understand the hypocrisy of calling him out for lack of loyalty and then 
demonstrating minimal loyalty in return. I don&rsquo;t support that position 
either. But I don&rsquo;t think that just because &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; does 
it, or because it is &ldquo;just a business&rdquo; means that it is OK to be 
completely selfish and disloyal.</p> 
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t actually hate Martin if he were to leave. I would be 
saddened, and definitely angry, but as time passed I&rsquo;m sure I would 
forgive him. After all, he did give us some great years while he was here, and 
an acrimonious exit should not, in my opinion, tarnish that legacy.</p> 
<p>But that&rsquo;s just me, I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone.</p>

less loyal to KSU then he was 1 month ago. If anything, i&rsquo;m glad 
he&rsquo;s honest and willing to admit that he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;never say 
never&rdquo; instead of spouting some &ldquo;i wanna retire here&rdquo; 
bullshit to get the press off his ass(it won&rsquo;t work anyway). This 
obviously isn&rsquo;t an easy decision and he has to consider all the options.

<h5> I was definitely adamant, </h5> 
<p>because there&rsquo;s no reason to leave, at least from any rational 
basketball sense. The programs aren&rsquo;t close to comparable on a fiscal, 
record, or tradition sense. If he takes the job,, he will have committed career 
suicide.</p> 
<blockquote> &hellip;willing to admit that he&rsquo;ll &quot;never say 
never&quot; instead of spouting some &quot;i wanna retire here&quot; bullshit 
to get the press off his ass(it won&rsquo;t work anyway).</blockquote> 
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a false dichotomy, though. All he has to say is, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in the job at the University of Miami, and 
won&rsquo;t take it if it&rsquo;s offered.&rdquo; Coaches remove themselves 
from consideration for jobs all the time.</p> 
<blockquote> This obviously isn&rsquo;t an easy decision and he has to 
consider all the options.</blockquote> 
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s about leveraging the situation for money, it IS an easy 
decision. I love the little town in southwest Kansas where I grew up. But if I 
had a job coaching a 5A or 6A school with some good basketball tradition, 
there&rsquo;s no way in hell I&rsquo;d move back there to coach a 1A 
school&mdash;especially if my town&rsquo;s school had instability in 
administration, crappy fan support, terrible facilities, and no basketball 
tradtion.</p>

<h5> I agree with your feelings on Miami, </h5> 
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible Frank sees a lot of potential there or at least 
enough to make him feel okay with going back &ldquo;home&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>I guess my point (and I think WW&rsquo;s) is that this is Frank&rsquo;s 
choice. Kansas State fans might find it offensive, but in the end it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Frank Martin doesn&rsquo;t owe KSU. If he&rsquo;d left 
after the Beasley year it would have been horrible. But he&rsquo;s given this 
school and program plenty for four years and if now is when he should leave 
then I think he&rsquo;s been nothing but a positive for Kansas State.</p> 
<p>I hope he sticks around for a long, long time and think he very well may. 
But I don&rsquo;t think we have much of a complaint if he chooses to go 
elsewhere.</p>

<h5> Well put </h5> 
<p>Great response, &lsquo;boozin. Loyalty is a two-way street and if Frank 
stays and KSU slumps the next few seasons will people be saying &quot;Why 
didn&rsquo;t he leave?&quot; I don&rsquo;t know, but maybe the question has to 
be asked before we jump to conclusions on all this. For Frank Martin, Miami is 
home. It is understandable that he would want to return to his roots &ndash; 
which happen to be in a tourist-y city on the beach in south Florida. All 
factors that work against K-State. Nothing we can do about climate and location 
and local culture. All K-State can do is show him and the program the love and 
support it has &ndash; and that is underlined by ground being broken on the new 
basketball facility. While I would be disappointed for sure, I wouldn&rsquo;t 
blame Frank Martin for leaving if the pull of home, a generous salary and 
outlined support towards the basketball program is forthcoming from the UM 
administration. But I do agree with K.Scott that it would make more sense for 
him to leap at the Florida job if it opened up to him than the Miami one. Two 
very different scales.</p>

decision to make.</p> 
<p>I like my school pretty well. I love my students. But if I decide that I

<h5> The Only Guy </h5> 
<p>Who wasn&rsquo;t replaceable had JC as his initials (and I don&rsquo;t mean 
John Currie). Frank will be Frank and I appreciate what he&rsquo;s saying the 
way he&rsquo;s saying it. Give in to angst if you must, but we are in a much 
better place right now to attract a quality coach than we have been since the 
retirement of Jack Hartman. Although Jack consistently had us competing for a 
Big 8 title and made some good runs in the dance, KSU still dipped down a bit 
to bring Kruger in. That was almost an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; hire since they 
knew what they were getting at least in respect to &ldquo;who&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;what&rdquo; he was. He was still somewhat unproven as a big time coach. 
At that point in our history, we were still hamstrung by an administration that 
didn&rsquo;t care if KSU played in the big time athletically.</p> 
<p>We can, now, have quality proven coaches competing to come here. We 
couldn&rsquo;t say that before Huggins came back, then left, and Frank took 
over. I hope Frank doesn&rsquo;t leave or even bothers to listen, but I refuse 
to get a knot my stomach over any of this.</p>

should go the route of hiring someone like Matthew Graves of Butler. He&rsquo;s 
still young (35, I think), and he&rsquo;s part of the Villa 7 group that seems 
to continue churning out good head coaches from the assistant coaching ranks. 
Also, working for Brad Stevens for years can&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in the Cane&rsquo;s DNA to get their shit 
together. They have to build a better program to bring a guy like Frank back 
home.</p>

<h5> Bang on, my man </h5> 
<p>As has been pointed out numerous times on multiple threads, basketball 
doesn&rsquo;t register at The U. Its football and then baseball and then 
everything else. Throwing money at it won&rsquo;t automatically make it better. 
What if Frank is offered a generous salary with equally generous salaries for 
his assistants, plus all kinds of other sweeteners and he goes there, wins, and 
fans<em>STILL</em> don&rsquo;t show up? I imagine that thought has crossed his 
mind a time or two.</p>

<h5> It's even worse than that ... </h5> 
<p>WINNING won&rsquo;t even automatically make it better. And that&rsquo;s 
AFTER you&rsquo;ve thrown money at it.</p> 
<p>Frank could win like crazy at Miami and south Florida <b>will not give a 
shit</b>.</p>

<h5> That's kind of rich, actually. </h5> 
<p>I mean, &ldquo;going in a different direction&rdquo;?!? I think they mean, 
&ldquo;going in a cheaper and far less-talented direction.&rdquo; Not that 
I&rsquo;m complaining, though.</p>

<h5> Random thoughts </h5> 
<p>I think MIA needs to make the call to Frank and if Frank wants to go home 
then he needs to take the call. Miami should ask Frank what it would take from 
every angle to get him there. Frank then rolls out everything they are lacking 
that he wants. They say sorry we cant do all that right now and thank you for 
taking the call. They hire some decent ast coach that really never has a true 
shot at winning. But during these next three years with said coach they slowly 
build up everything on Franks list. In three years when the job opens back up 
again because coach without a shot gets fired they will have Franks list 
complete and only have to worry about money. At which point Frank goes home!!
</p> 
<p>IMO- Miami is a job that will be open again in 3 years so why not get the 
wishlist and start working on it one item at a time&hellip;.</p>

<h5> amused </h5> 
<p>Basically what I&rsquo;m reading is lots of speculation and angst.</p> 
<p>I have no idea how HCFM thinks or feels other than what he provides via 
various outlets.</p> 
<p>Just because one of us thinks/feels that KSU is a good job doesn&rsquo;t 
mean that it is a good job in all circumstances for HCFM.</p> 
<p>If HCFM gets a better offer, or one that he (and family) perceives is a 
better offer then I hope he takes it or requires K-State to match it.</p> 
<p>I would prefer HCFM to stick around and continue to build K-State 
basketball back to the point it was in the legendary Tex Winter days. But if he 
leaves, then I think Brad Underwood would be an acceptable replacement that can 
continue the journey.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m amused that nothing is really known other than 
speculation at this point.</p>

<h5> 90 % sure Martin will stay </h5> 
<p>People keep telling me that there are rumors about Frank Martin leaving 
Kansas State for Miami, but so far all the speculation seems to be based on is 
1) a job opening at Miami and 2) the recent development that Mike Anderson left 
Missouri for his heartthrob of Arkansas.</p> 
<p>To me &ndash; and I say this as a member of the sports media &ndash; this 
is just people talking about hypothetical scenarios. As for Frank not 
addressing the media about it &hellip; well, I could be wrong, but I think part 
of that is just him being a bit annoyed that people are making such a big deal 
of this when there is nothing to give it any credence.</p> 
<p>When I was first told, &ldquo;Did you hear Frank might be leaving for 
Miami?&rdquo; I asked if there were actually any articles by legitimate 
newspapers to back it up. So far, I haven&rsquo;t found any. That&rsquo;s why I 
haven&rsquo;t written anything about &ndash; no column for the paper, nothing 
on my blog. As of now, it just seems like a lot of talk.</p>

<h5> exactly </h5> 
<p>I think everyone likes HCFM so the idea of him leaving is what is driving 
the conversation.</p>
