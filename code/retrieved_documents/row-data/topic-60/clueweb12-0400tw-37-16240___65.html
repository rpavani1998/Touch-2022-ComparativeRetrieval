<p><b>American football</b> is a sport played between two teams of eleven with 
the objective of scoring points by advancing theball into the opposing team's 
end zone. Known in the United States simply as <b>football</b>, it may also be 
referred to informally as<b>gridiron football</b>.[1][2] The ball can be 
advanced byrunning with it or throwing it to a teammate. Points can be scored by
carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over 
that goal line,kicking the ball through the opponent's goal posts or tackling 
an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone.</p> 
<p>In the United States, the major forms are high school football, college 
football and professional football. Each of these are played under slightly 
different rules.[3] High school football is governed by the National Federation 
of State High School Associations and college football by the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association and National Association of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. The major league for professional football is the National Football 
League.</p> 
<p>American football is closely related to Canadian football but with some 
differences in rules and the field.[4] Both sports can be traced to early 
versions ofassociation football and rugby football.</p>

<h2> History</h2>  Main article: History of American football <br>
<br>
 An 
American football team at the turn of the 20th century. Note the continued use 
of a rugby-type ball (front row, right). 
<p>The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby 
football and association football. Both games have their origins in varieties 
of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, in which a 
ball is kicked at agoal and/or run over a line. Many games known as 
&quot;football&quot; were being played at colleges and universities in the 
United States in the first half of the 19th century.[5][6]</p> 
<p>Rutgers University and its neighbor, Princeton University, played the first 
game of intercollegiate football on 6 November 1869 on a plot of ground where 
the present-day Rutgers gymnasium now stands in New Brunswick, N.J. Rutgers won 
that first game, 6-4.[7]</p> <br>
Walter Camp <br>

<p>American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby 
football, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, considered 
the &quot;Father of American Football.&quot; Among these important changes were 
the introduction of theline of scrimmage and of down-and-distance rules. In the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries, game play developments by college coaches 
such asEddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Knute Rockne, and Glenn 
&quot;Pop&quot; Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward 
pass.</p> 
<p>The popularity of <b>collegiate football</b> grew as it became the dominant 
version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century.Bowl games, a 
college football tradition, attracted a national audience for collegiate teams. 
Bolstered by fiercerivalries, college football still holds widespread appeal in 
the US.[5][8][9]</p> 
<p>The origin of <b>professional football</b> can be traced back to 1892, with 
William &quot;Pudge&quot; Heffelfinger's $500 contract to play in a game for the
Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The first 
Professional &quot;league&quot; was theOhio League, formed in 1903, and the 
first Professional Football championship game was between theBuffalo Prospects 
and theCanton Bulldogs in 1919. In 1920, the American Professional Football 
Association was formed. The first game was played inDayton, Ohio on October 3, 
1920 with the hostTriangles defeating the Columbus Panhandles 14&ndash;0. The 
league changed its name to theNational Football League (NFL) two years later, 
and eventually became themajor league of American football. Initially a sport 
of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States, professional football 
eventually became a national phenomenon. Football's increasing popularity is 
usually traced to the1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest that has been dubbed 
the &quot;Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. A rival league to the NFL, the
American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960; the pressure it put on the 
senior league led to amerger between the two leagues and the creation of the 
Super Bowl, which has become the most watched television event in the United 
States on an annual basis.[10]</p> 
<p><b>High school football</b> dates to the 1880s and enjoys regional 
popularity.</p> 
<h2> Rules</h2>  Main article: American football rules <br>

<h3> Field and players</h3> <br>
 The numbers on the field indicate the number 
ofyards to the nearest goal line. <br>

<p>Football is played on a field 360 by 160 feet (120.0 by 53.3 yards; 109.7 
by 48.8 meters).[11] The longer boundary lines are <i>sidelines</i>, while the 
shorter boundary lines are<i>end lines</i>. Sidelines and end lines are out of 
bounds. Near each end of the field is a<i>goal line</i>; they are 100 yards 
(91.4&nbsp;m) apart. A scoring area called an<i>end zone</i> extends 10 yards 
(9.1&nbsp;m) beyond each goal line to each end line. The end zone includes the 
goal line but not the end line.[11] While the playing field is effectively 
flat, it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown&mdash;with the 
middle of the field higher than the sides&mdash;to allow water to drain from 
the field.</p> 
<p><i>Yard lines</i> cross the field every 5 yards (4.6&nbsp;m), and are 
numbered every 10 yards from each goal line to the 50-yard line, or midfield 
(similar to a typicalrugby league field). Two rows of short lines, known as 
inbounds lines or<i>hash marks</i>, run at 1-yard (91.4&nbsp;cm) intervals 
perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field. All plays start 
with the ball on or between the hash marks. Because of the arrangement of the 
lines, the field is occasionally referred to as a<i>gridiron</i> in a reference 
to thecooking grill with a similar pattern of lines.</p> 
<p>At the back of each end zone are two <i>goalposts</i> (also called <i>
uprights</i>) connected by a crossbar 10 feet (3.05&nbsp;m) from the ground. 
For high skill levels, the posts are 18&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (5.64&nbsp;m) 
apart. For lower skill levels, these are widened to 23&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches 
(7.11&nbsp;m).</p> 
<p>Each team has 11 players on the field at a time. Usually there are many 
more players off the field (an NFL team has a limit of 53 players on their 
roster, 46 of which can be dressed for a game). However, teams may substitute 
for any or all of their players during the breaks between plays. As a result, 
players have very specialized roles and are divided into three separate units: 
theoffense, the defense and the special teams. It is rare for all team members 
to participate in a given game, as some roles have little utility beyond that 
of an injury substitute.</p> 
<h3> Start of halves</h3> 
<p>The game begins with a coin toss to determine which team will kick off to 
begin the game and which goal each team will defend.[12] The options are 
presented again to start the second half; the choices for the first half do not 
automatically determine the start of the second half. The referee conducts the 
coin toss with the captains (or sometimes coaches) of the opposing teams. The 
team that wins the coin toss has three options:[12]</p> 
<ol> 
<li>They may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff.</li> 
<li>They may choose which goal to defend.</li> 
<li>They may choose to <i>defer</i> the first choice to the other team and 
have first choice to start the second half.[13]</li> </ol> 
<p>Whatever the first team chooses, the second team has the option on the 
other choice (for example, if the first team elects to receive at the start of 
the game, the second team can decide which goal to defend).</p> 
<p>At the start of the second half, the options to kick, receive, or choose a 
goal to defend are presented to the captains again. The team which did not 
choose first to start the first half (or which deferred its privilege to choose 
first) now gets first choice of options.[12][14]</p> 
<h3> Game duration</h3> 
<p>A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters (12-minute 
quarters in high-school football and often shorter at lower levels),[15] with a 
half-time intermission after the second quarter.[16] Depending upon the level 
of competition, the duration of the half-time ranges from 10 to 20 minutes. At 
all levels, a down (play) that begins before time expires is allowed to 
continue until its completion, even after the clock reaches zero. The clock is 
also stopped after certain plays, therefore, a game can last considerably 
longer (often more than three hours in real time), and if a game is broadcast on
television, TV timeouts are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast 
commercials outside of game action. If an NFL game is tied after four quarters, 
the teams play an additional period lasting up to 15 minutes. In a regular 
season NFL overtime game, the first team that scores wins, even if the other 
team does not get a possession; this is referred to assudden death. However, in 
a post-season NFL game during the playoffs, if the first team with possession 
scores only a field goal, the other team is allowed the opportunity to match or 
better this score. This rule only affects playoff games in overtime in which 
the first team with possession scores a field goal: if the first team with 
possession scores a touchdown, the sudden death rules take effect. In a 
regular-season NFL game, if neither team scores in overtime, the game is a tie. 
In an NFL playoff game, additional overtime periods are played, as needed, to 
determine a winner.College overtime rules are more complicated.</p> <br>

<h3> Advancing the ball</h3> 
<p>The team that takes possession of the ball (the <b>offense</b>) has four 
attempts, called<b>downs</b>, in which to advance the ball at least 10 yards 
toward their opponent's (the<b>defense</b>'s) end zone. When the offense 
succeeds in gaining at least 10 yards, it gets a<b>first down</b>, meaning the 
team starts a new set of four downs to gain yet another 10 yards or to score. 
If the offense fails to gain a first down (10 yards) after four downs, the 
other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down 
ended, beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite 
direction.</p> 
<p>Except at the beginning of halves and after scores, the ball is always put 
into play by a<b>snap</b>. Offensive players line up facing defensive players 
at the<b>line of scrimmage</b> (the position on the field where the play 
begins). One offensive player, the<b>center</b>, then passes (or 
&quot;snaps&quot;) the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind 
him, usually the<b>quarterback</b>.</p> 
<p>Players can then advance the ball in two ways:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>By running with the ball, also known as <b>rushing</b>.</li> 
<li>By throwing the ball to a teammate, known as a <b>pass</b> or as <b>passing
</b> the football. If the pass is thrown down-field, it is known as a forward 
pass. The forward pass is a key factor distinguishing American and Canadian 
football from other football sports. The offense can throw the ball forward 
only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage. However, 
the ball can be handed-off to another player or thrown, pitched, or tossed 
sideways or backwards (alateral pass) at any time.</li> </ol> 
<p>A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The player with the ball is forced to the ground (a <b>tackle</b>) or has 
his forward progress halted by members of the other team (as determined by an<b>
official</b>).</li> 
<li>A forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field (<b>out of bounds
</b>) or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an <b>
incomplete pass</b>. The ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage 
for the next down.</li> 
<li>The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds.</li> 
<li>A team scores.</li> </ul> 
<p>Officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over.</p> 
<p>Before each down, each team chooses a <b>play</b>, or coordinated movements 
and actions, that the players should follow on a down. Sometimes, downs 
themselves are referred to as &quot;plays.&quot;</p> 
<h3> Change of possession</h3> 
<p>The offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following 
things occurs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The team fails to get a first down&mdash; i.e., in four downs they fail to 
move the ball past a line 10 yards ahead of where they got their last first 
down. The defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the 4th-down 
play ends. A change of possession in this manner is commonly called a<b>
turnover on downs</b>.</li> 
<li>The offense scores a touchdown or field goal. The team that scored then 
kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a<b>kickoff</b>.</li> 
<li>The offense punts the ball to the defense. A <b>punt</b> is a kick in 
which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. Punts are 
nearly always made on fourth down, when the offensive team does not want to 
risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field 
(through a failed attempt to make a first down) and feels it is too far from 
the other team's goal post to attempt a field goal.</li> 
<li>A defensive player catches a forward pass. This is called an <b>
interception</b>, and the player who makes the interception can run with the 
ball until he is tackled, forced out of bounds, or scores.</li> 
<li>An offensive player drops the ball (a <b>fumble</b>) and a defensive 
player picks it up. As with interceptions, a player recovering a fumble can run 
with the ball until tackled, forced out of bounds, or scoring. Passes that are 
thrown either backwards or parallel with the line of scrimmage (lateral passes) 
that are not caught do not cause the down to end as incomplete forward passes 
do; instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled. Lost fumbles and 
interceptions are together known as<b>turnovers</b>.</li> 
<li>The offensive team misses a field goal attempt. The defensive team gets 
the ball at the spot where the previous play began (or, in the NFL, at the spot 
of the kick). If the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within 20 yards of 
the end zone, the other team gets the ball at its own 20 yard line (that is, 20 
yards from the end zone). If a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball 
remains in the field of play, a defensive player may pick up the ball and 
attempt to advance it. In this last case, possession is awarded at the spot 
where the recovering player is ruled down.</li> 
<li>(Rare) While in his own end zone, an offensive ball carrier is tackled, 
forced out of bounds, loses the ball out of bounds, or the offense commits 
certain fouls in the end zone. This fairly rare occurrence is called a<b>safety
</b>.</li> 
<li>(Rare) An offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the 
opposing end zone, and then the ball goes out of bounds. This rare occurrence 
leads to a<b>touchback</b>, with the ball going over to the opposing team at 
their 20 yard line (Note that touchbacks during non-offensive special teams 
plays, such as punts and kickoffs, are quite common).</li> </ul> 
<h3> Scoring</h3>  Main article: American_football_rules#Scoring <br>

<p>A team scores points by the following plays:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A <b>touchdown</b> (TD) is worth 6 points.[16] It is scored when a player 
runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent's end zone.[16] A 
touchdown is analogous to atry in rugby. Unlike rugby, a player does not have 
to touch the ball to the ground to score; a touchdown is scored any time a 
player has possession of the ball while any part of the ball is beyond the 
vertical plane created by the leading edge of the opponent's goal line stripe 
(the stripe itself is a part of the end zone).
<ul> 
<li>After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a <b>try</b> (which is also 
analogous to theconversion in rugby). The ball is placed at the other team's 3 
yard line (the 2 yard line in the NFL). The team can attempt to kick it through 
the goalposts (over the crossbar and between the uprights) in the manner of a 
field goal for 1 point (an<b>extra point</b> or <b>point-after touchdown (PAT)[
17]</b>), or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for 
2 points (a<b>two-point conversion</b>). In college football, if the defense 
intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two point conversion attempt 
and returns it to the opposing end zone, the defensive team is awarded the two 
points.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>A <b>field goal</b> (FG) is worth 3 points, and it is scored by kicking 
the ball through the goalposts defended by the opposition.[16] Field goals may 
be place kicked (kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by 
a teammate) ordrop kicked (extremely uncommon in the modern game due to the 
better accuracy of place kicks, with only two successful drop kicks in 
sixty-plus years in the NFL). A field goal is usually attempted on fourth down 
instead of a punt when the ball is close enough to the opponent's goalposts, 
or, when there is little or no time left to otherwise score.</li> 
<li>(Rare) A <b>safety</b>, worth 2 points, is scored by the opposing team 
when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball 
becoming dead behind its own goal line. For instance, a safety is scored by the 
defense if an offensive player is tackled, goes out of bounds, or fumbles the 
ball out of bounds in his own end zone.[16] Safeties are relatively rare. Note 
that, though even more rare, the team initially on offense during a down can 
score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball 
in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his 
own end zone where it becomes dead. However, if the ball becomes dead behind 
the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the 
ball being there (for instance, if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its 
own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the 
end zone) it is a touchback: no points are scored and the team last in 
possession keeps possession with a first down at its own 20 yard line. In the 
extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try, it is worth only 1 
point.</li> </ul> 
<h3> Kickoffs and free kicks</h3> <br>
 The Florida State Seminoles (in red, 
at top) line up to kick off to theVirginia Tech Hokies. <br>

<p>Each half begins with a kickoff. Teams also kick off after scoring 
touchdowns and field goals. The ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the 
team's own 35 yard line in the NFL (as of the 2011 season) and 30 yard line in 
college football (as of the 2007 season). The other team's kick returner tries 
to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible. Where he is stopped is the 
point where the offense will begin its<b>drive</b>, or series of offensive 
plays. If the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone, he can either 
run with the ball, or elect for a<b>touchback</b> by kneeling in the end zone, 
in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own 
20 yard line. A touchback also occurs when the kick goes out-of-bounds in the 
end zone. (Punts and turnovers in the end zone can also result in atouchback). 
A kickoff that goes out-of-bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being 
touched by the receiving team is a foul, and the ball will be placed within the 
hash marks of the yard line where it went out of bounds, or 30 yards from the 
kickoff spot, depending on which is more advantageous to the receiving team.[18]
 Unlike with punts, once a kickoff goes 10 yards and the ball has hit the 
ground, it can be recovered by the kicking team.[18] A team, especially one who 
is losing, can try to take advantage of this by attempting anonside kick.</p> 
<p>After safeties, the team that gave up the points must free kick the ball to 
the other team from its own 20 yard line.[19]</p> 
<h3> Penalties</h3> <br>
 A penalty flag on the field during a game on 
November 16, 2008 between theSan Francisco 49ers and St. Louis Rams. <br>
 Main 
article:Penalty (American football) <br>

<p>Fouls (a type of rule violation) are punished with <b>penalties</b> against 
the offending team. Most penalties result in moving the football towards the 
offending team's end zone. If the penalty would move the ball more than half 
the distance towards the offender's end zone, the penalty becomes half the 
distance to the goal instead of its normal value.</p> 
<p>Most penalties result in replaying the down. Some defensive penalties give 
the offense an automatic first down.[20] Conversely, some offensive penalties 
result in loss of a down (loss of the right to repeat the down).[20] If a 
penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down, they get 
a first down, as usual. The only penalty that results in points is if a team on 
offense commits certain fouls, such as holding, in its own end zone, which 
results in asafety.</p> 
<p>If a foul occurs during a down (after the play has begun), the down is 
allowed to continue and an official throws a yellowpenalty flag near the spot 
of the foul. When the down ends, the team that did not commit the foul has the 
option of accepting the penalty, or declining the penalty and accepting the 
result of the down.</p>

player is tagged/tackled, then that team has to throw the ball to the opposing 
team. This repeats until time runs out or the players decide to quit.</dd> </dl>

<h2> Players</h2> <br>
 This diagram shows typical offensive and defensive 
formations. Because teams can change any or all of the players between plays, 
the number of players at certain positions may differ on a given play. Here the 
offense is in the Normal I-Formation while the defense is in a 4&ndash;3 Normal.
 Main article:American football positions <br>
 See also: Formation (American 
football) <br>

<p>Most football players have highly specialized roles. At the college and NFL 
levels, most play only offense or only defense.</p> 
<h3> Offense</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>The <b>offensive line</b> (OL) consists of five players whose job is to 
protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the 
defense. The lineman in the middle is the center. Outside the center are the 
guards, and outside them are the tackles. Except for the center, who snaps the 
ball to one of the backs, offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball.
</li> 
<li>The <b>quarterback</b> (QB) receives the snap from the center on most 
plays. He then hands or tosses it to a running back, throws it to a receiver or 
runs with it himself. The quarterback is the leader of the offense and calls 
the plays that are signaled to him from the sidelines.</li> 
<li><b>Running backs</b> (RB) line up behind or beside the QB and specialize 
in running with the ball. They also block, catch passes and, on rare occasions, 
pass the ball to others or even receive the snap. If a team has two running 
backs in the game, usually one will be a<b>halfback</b> (HB) (or <b>tailback</b>
 (TB)), who is more likely to run with the ball, and the other will usually be a
<b>fullback</b> (FB), who is more likely to block.</li> 
<li><b>Wide receivers</b> (WR) line up near the sidelines. They specialize in 
catching passes, though they also block for running plays or downfield after 
another receiver makes a catch.</li> 
<li><b>Tight ends</b> (TE) line up next to the offensive line. They can play 
either like wide receivers (catch passes) or like offensive linemen (protect 
the QB or create spaces for runners). Sometimes an offensive lineman takes the 
tight end position and is referred to as a<b>tackle eligible</b>.[21]</li> </ul>
<p>At least seven players must line up on the line of scrimmage on every 
offensive play. The other players may line up anywhere behind the line. The 
exact number of running backs, wide receivers and tight ends may differ on any 
given play. For example, if the team needs only one yard, it may use three 
tight ends, two running backs and no wide receivers. On the other hand, if it 
needs 20 yards, it may replace all of its running backs and tight ends with 
wide receivers.</p> 
<h3> Defense</h3> 
<p>In contrast to members of the offense, the rules of professional football (
NFL Rulebook) and American college football (NCAA Rulebook) do not specify 
starting position, movement, or coverage zones for members of the defensive 
team, except that they must be in the defensive zone at the start of play. The 
positions, movements and responsibilities of all defensive players are assigned 
by the team by selection of certain coverages, or patterns of placement and 
assignment of responsibilities. The positional roles are customary. These roles 
have varied over the history of American football. The following are customary 
defensive positions used in many coverages in modern American football.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The <b>defensive line</b> consists of three to six players who line up 
immediately across from the offensive line. They try to occupy the offensive 
linemen in order to free up the linebackers, disrupt the backfield (behind the 
offensive line) of the offense, andtackle the running back if he has the ball 
before he can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw or pass the 
ball. They are the first line of defense.</li> 
<li>Behind the defensive line are the <b>linebackers</b>. They line up between 
the defensive line and defensive backs and may either rush the quarterback or 
cover potential receivers.</li> 
<li>The last line of defense is known as the secondary, comprising at least 
three players who line up as<b>defensive backs</b>, who are either <b>
cornerbacks</b> or <b>safeties</b>. They cover the receivers and try to stop 
pass completions. They occasionally rush the quarterback.</li> </ul> 
<h3> Special teams</h3> 
<p>The units of players who handle kicking plays are known as <b>special teams
</b>. Three important special-teams players are the <b>punter</b>, who handles 
punts, the<b>placekicker</b> or kicker, who kicks off and attempts field goals 
and extra points, and the<b>long snapper</b>, who snaps the ball for extra 
points, field goals, and punts. Also included on special teams are the 
returners. These players return punts or kickoffs and try to get in good field 
position. These players can also score touchdowns.</p> 
<h3> Uniform numbering</h3> <br>
 Quarterback Shaun Carney has uniform number 
5.<br>

<p>In the NFL, ranges of uniform numbers are (usually) reserved for certain 
positions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1&ndash;19: Quarterbacks, punters and placekickers (by rule)[22]</li> 
<li>20&ndash;49: Running backs and defensive backs (by rule)[23]</li> 
<li>50&ndash;59: Centers and linebackers (by custom)[24]</li> 
<li>60&ndash;79: Offensive guards and tackles (mandatory),[25] defensive 
guards and tackles (by custom)</li> 
<li>10&ndash;19, 80&ndash;89: Wide receivers (by rule)[26]</li> 
<li>80&ndash;89 (by rule),[27] 40-49 (optional): Tight ends</li> 
<li>90&ndash;99: Defensive ends and linebackers (by custom)</li> 
<li>Players who switch positions in their career can keep their number if they 
played their prior position for at least a year and move from a position that 
is eligible to receive passes to another eligible position, or if he is moving 
from one ineligible position to another ineligible position.[28][29]</li> </ul> 
<p>Players wearing numbers between 50 and 79 inclusive are ineligible to 
receive forward passes, unless they &quot;report as eligible&quot; to the 
official.</p> 
<p>NCAA and high school rules specify only that offensive linemen must have 
numbers in the 50&ndash;79 range, but the NCAA &quot;strongly recommends&quot; 
that quarterbacks and running backs have numbers below 50 and wide receivers 
numbers above 79.[30] This helps officials, as it means that numbers 50 to 79 
are<b>ineligible receivers</b>, or players that may not receive a forward pass 
(except in the rare instance when a Tackle lines up as the outermost lineman on 
his side of the line and the officials are notified that he will be an eligible 
receiver for that particular play). There are no numbering restrictions on 
defensive players in the NCAA, other than that a team may not have two players 
on the field at the same time with the samejersey number.[31]</p> 
<h2> Basic strategy</h2>  Main article: American football strategy <br>

<p>Because the game stops after every down, giving teams a chance to call a 
new play, strategy plays a major role in football. Each team has a<b>playbook
</b> of dozens to hundreds of plays. Ideally, each play is a scripted, 
strategically sound team-coordinated endeavor. Some plays are very safe; they 
are likely to get only a few yards. Other plays have the potential for long 
gains but at a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover.</p> 
<p>Generally speaking, rushing plays are less risky than passing plays. 
However, there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays. To 
deceive the other team, some passing plays are designed to resemble running 
plays and vice versa. These are referred to as play-action passes and draws, 
respectively. There are many trick or gadget plays, such as when a team lines 
up as if it intends to punt and then tries to run or pass for a first down. 
Such high-risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work. However, 
they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts 
accordingly.</p> 
<p>The defense also plans plays in response to expectations of what the 
offense will do. For example, a &quot;blitz&quot; (using linebackers or 
defensive backs to charge the quarterback) is often attempted when the team on 
defense expects a pass. A blitz makes downfield passing more difficult but 
exposes the defense to big gains if the offensive line stems the rush.</p> 
<p>Many hours of preparation and strategizing, including film review by both 
players and coaches, go into the days between football games. This, along with 
the demanding physicality of football (see below), is why teams typically play 
at most one game per week.</p> 
<h2> Physicality</h2>  Main articles: Health issues in American football and 
American football protective equipment <br>
<br>
 A halfback leads fellow backs 
through an agility drill at the Air Force Academy 
<p>Football is a collision sport. To stop the offense from advancing the ball, 
the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking or pulling him 
down. As such, defensive players must use some form of physical contact to 
bring the ball-carrier to the ground, within certain rules and guidelines. 
Tacklers cannot kick or punch the runner. They also cannot grab the face mask 
of the runner's helmet or lead into a tackle with their own helmet 
(&quot;spearing&quot;). Despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary 
roughness, most other forms of tackling are legal. Blockers and defenders 
trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents 
out of the way. Quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full 
speed from outside the quarterback's field of vision. This is commonly known as 
a blindside.</p> 
<p>To compensate for this, players must wear special protective equipment, 
such as a padded plastichelmet, shoulder pads, hip pads and knee pads. These 
protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to 
help minimize lastinginjury to players. An unintended consequence of all the 
safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game. 
Players may now hurl themselves at one another at high speeds without a 
significant chance of injury. The injuries that do result tend to be severe and 
often season or career-ending and sometimes fatal. In previous years with less 
padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles inRugby football. Better 
helmets have allowed players to use their helmets as weapons. This form of 
tackling is particularly unwise, because of the great potential for brain or
spinal injury. All this has caused the various leagues, especially the NFL, to 
implement a complicated series of penalties for various types of contact. Most 
recently, virtually any contact with the helmet of a defensive player on the 
quarterback, or any contact to the quarterback's head, is now a foul. During 
the late 1970s, the penalty in high school football for spearing included 
ejection from the game.[32]</p> 
<p>Despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety, injuries 
remain very common in football. It is increasingly rare, for example, for NFL 
quarterbacks or running backs (who take the most direct hits) to make it 
through an entire season without missing some time to injury.[<i>citation needed
</i>] Additionally, 28 football players died from direct football injuries in 
the years 2000&ndash;05 and an additional 68 died indirectly from dehydration 
or other examples of &quot;non-physical&quot; dangers, according to the 
National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.[33] Concussions are 
common, with about 41,000 suffered every year among high school players 
according to the Brain Injury Association of Arizona.[34] In 1981, U.S. 
PresidentRonald Reagan, who played football in high school, commented on the 
contact of the sport: &quot;Football is the last thing left in civilization 
where men can literally fling themselves bodily at one another in combat and 
not be at war.&quot;[35]</p> 
<p>Extra and optional equipment such as neck rolls, spider pads, rib 
protectors (referred to as &quot;flak jackets&quot;), andelbow pads help 
against injury as well, though they do not tend to be used by the majority of 
players due to their lack of requirement.</p> 
<p>The danger of football, and the equipment required to reduce it, make 
regulation football impractical for casual play.Flag football and touch football
 are less violent variants of the game popular among recreational players.</p> 
<h3> Nutrition and dehydration</h3> 
<p>Football players typically begin their season while the weather is still 
extremely warm and with the dangerous combination of warm weather and high 
humidity, dehydration is a great risk for the players.[36] The players are 
usually required to follow a hydration schedule. It is extremely important for 
players to drink enough fluids because dehydration can seriously reduce 
athletic performance and increase the risk of heat illnesses. Most trainers and 
coaches make it imperative for their players to drink fluids before they are 
thirsty.[36]</p> 
<h3> Brain injury</h3> 
<p>The Concussions Committee of the NFL, co-chaired by Dr. Ira Casson, has 
generally denied that concussions result in permanent brain injury. However, 
there is some research, reported in 2009, which, using phone interviews based 
on theNational Health Interview Survey, showed increased incidence of diagnosis 
ofmemory loss and dementia among retired professional football players; chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy diagnoses are increasingly common among deceased 
football players. Such symptoms are believed related to the effects of
concussions. More rigorous research is being conducted by Dr. Casson, 
neurologist, for the NFL. This finding is considered significant as such 
injuries may potentially affect high school and college players also.[37]</p> 
<h3> Heart disease</h3> 
<p>While retired NFL players have a lower overall rate of death compared to 
men in the general U.S. population, players at certain positions have a higher 
incidence ofheart disease. Defensive linemen were 42% more likely to die from 
heart disease than men in the general population. They also faced a greater 
risk ofcardiomyopathy. The increased incidence of heart disease may be 
attributed to highBMI measurements: retired players&mdash;notably offensive and 
defensive linemen&mdash;with a playing-time BMI of 30 or more had double the 
risk of dying from heart disease as compared to other players. Steroid use may 
also play a role. In a survey of more than 3,000 retired players, 9% reported 
having usedanabolic steroids while playing. Among them, offensive and defensive 
linemen were the most likely to report use (16.3% and 14.8%, respectively).[38]

<h2> Organization in the United States</h2>  Main article: American football 
in the United States <br>

<p>In the United States, the major forms are high school football, college 
football and professional football. Most American high schools field football 
teams. In general, high school teams play only against other teams within the 
samestate, but there are some exceptions like nearby schools located on 
opposite sides of a state line.</p> 
<p>Most of college football in the United States is governed by the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and most colleges and universities 
around the country have football teams. These teams mostly play other similarly 
sized schools, through the NCAA's divisional system, which divides the schools 
into four divisions:Division I Bowl Subdivision, Division I Championship 
Subdivision, Division II, and Division III. Unlike the three smaller NCAA 
football divisions, the Division I Bowl Subdivision does not have an organized 
tournament to determine its national champion. Instead, teams are invited to 
compete in a number of post-seasonbowl games. In addition, the champions of six 
conferences in the Division I Bowl Subdivision receive automatic bids, and four 
other schools receive &quot;at-large&quot; bids, to those five bowl games under 
the highly lucrativeBowl Championship Series to help determine the national 
champion.</p> 
<p>The highest level major professional league in the United States is the 
32-teamNational Football League (NFL). Another professional league, the 5-team 
United Football League, also currently operates. Several semi-professional, 
women's semi-professional football, andindoor football leagues are also played 
across the country.</p> 
<h3> Calendar</h3> <br>
 Amateurs playing on Thanksgiving <br>

<p>Although professional football has been played in every month of the year, 
football is traditionally an autumn sport. A season typically begins in 
mid-to-late August and runs through December, into January. This arrangement 
arose when football was in its early stages, and many of the early professional 
teams shared playing fields (and sometimes players) with baseball teams; the 
end of baseball season was accordingly set up to also serve as the start of 
football season. AlthoughThanksgiving was the traditional end of the season for 
most college and early professional teams, playoffs and extended seasons have 
pushed seasons further into the winter season. The NFL playoffs run further 
through January, and theSuper Bowl is often played in the first week of 
February. As such, the sport is played in a wide range of weather conditions, 
from the heat and humidity of late summer, to the cold winds and snow in 
mid-winter. Unlikerainouts in baseball, play is only generally postponed or 
canceled for conditions that would pose a hazard to the safety of the fans and 
personnel involved, such asblizzards, hurricanes and severe thunderstorms.</p> 
<p>Because of the amount of physical wear the game can inflict on the human 
body, American football seasons are typically far shorter than the comparable 
seasons of other popular American sports. It is very rare for football teams at 
any level to play more than one game in a week. For comparison, theNational 
Hockey League and National Basketball Association traditionally play an 82-game 
regular season over the course of six months, plus a postseason composed of 
four rounds of best-of-seven series. The NFL plays 16 games over the course of 
four months, with a single-elimination tournament of three to four rounds.</p> 
<p>The NFL Draft is usually held in April, in which eligible college football 
players are selected by NFL teams, the order of selection determined by the 
teams' final regular season records.</p> 
<p>It is a long-standing tradition in the United States (though not 
universally observed) that high school football games are played on Friday 
night, college games on Saturday, and professional games on Sunday.</p> 
<p>In the 1970s, the NFL began to schedule one game on Monday nights. 
Beginning in 2006, the NFL began schedulinggames on Thursday nights in 
mid-November, aired on theNFL Network; NFL games have also been scheduled on 
Saturday nights toward the end of the season.</p> 
<p>Nationally televised Thursday-night college games have become a weekly 
fixture onESPN, and most nights of the week feature at least one college game, 
though most games are still played on the traditional Saturday.</p> 
<p>Certain fall and winter holidays&mdash;such as the NFL's Thanksgiving 
Classic and numerous New Year's Day college bowl games&mdash;have traditional 
football games associated with them.</p> 
<p>Despite this, there are a few professional leagues that have played in the 
late winter, spring, or summer, mainly to avoid competition with the 
established leagues. Examples include the now defunctXFL, the United States 
Football League, and the proposed All American Football League. Indoor football 
is played primarily in spring for this same reason; leagues that are based in 
Europe and Asia also generally play an earlier season.</p> 
<p>At most levels of competition, college football teams hold several weeks of 
practices in the spring. These practices typically end with an intramural 
scrimmage open to the public. In certain areas, high school football teams also 
hold spring practices.</p> 
<h2> Outside the United States</h2> 
<p>Outside the United States, the sport is referred to as &quot;American 
football&quot; (or a translation thereof) to differentiate it from otherfootball
 codes such asassociation football (soccer), Rugby League, Rugby Union, 
Australian rules football and Gaelic football. In Australia and New Zealand the 
game is also known asgridiron football, or more commonly as gridiron,[1][39] 
although in the United States the term<i>gridiron</i> refers only to the 
playing field itself.[40] The term <i>gridiron</i> has also been used in the UK 
to describe the game.[41] In much of the world, the term football is 
unambiguous and refers to association football (known commonly as 'soccer' in 
theUnited States).</p> 
<h3> Exportation by the established U.S. leagues and organizations</h3> 
<p>In 1977, the semi-pro football teams Newton Nite Hawks and Chicago Lions 
completed a five-game tour in Europe.[42] These were the first professional or 
semi-professional American football teams to play organized games on the 
European continent. Games were played in Versailles, France; Lille, France; 
Landstuhl, Germany; Gratz Austria; and Vienna, Austria.[43]</p> 
<p>In 1985, Bethany College head coach and future College Football Hall of Fame
 memberTed Kessinger brought the first American football team to play in Sweden
. The Bethany &quot;Terrible Swedes&quot; defeated the Swedish all-star team 
72&ndash;7 inStockholm Olympic Stadium.[44]</p> 
<p>The NFL has attempted to introduce the game to other nations and operated a 
developmental league,NFL Europa (also known as the World League of American 
Football and NFL Europe) with teams in various European cities, but this league 
was closed down following the 2007 season. The professionalCanadian Football 
League and collegiate Canadian Interuniversity Sport play under the slightly 
differentCanadian rules.</p> 
<p>Major American leagues have also held some regular season games outside of 
the United States. On October 2, 2005, theArizona Cardinals and San Francisco 
49ers played the first regular season NFL game outside of the United States, in 
Mexico City'sEstadio Azteca,[45] From 2007, the NFL has played or has plans to 
play at least one regular season game outside of the United States during each 
season. TheNCAA will also play games outside of the U.S. In 2012, The United 
States Naval Academy will play the University of Notre Dame inDublin, Ireland.[

<h3> The IFAF and the American Football World Cup</h3>  Main article: 
International Federation of American Football <br>

<p>The International Federation of American Football (IFAF) is the <i>de facto
</i> governing body for American football, with 45 member associations from 
North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The organization is 
headquartered inLa Courneuve, France. Although the IFAF has relatively little 
standing in the U.S. compared to the NFL, NCAA, and the other established 
aforementioned bodies, these same organizations also give support toUSA Football
, the designated U.S. representative to the IFAF.</p> 
<p>The IFAF also oversees the American Football World Cup, which is held every 
four years. Japan won the first two World Cups, held in 1999 and 2003. Team 
USA, which had not participated in the previous World Cups, won the title in 
2007 and 2011.</p> 
<p>A long term goal of the IFAF is for American football to be accepted by the 
International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport.[49] The only time that the 
sport was played wasat the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a 
demonstration sport.</p>
