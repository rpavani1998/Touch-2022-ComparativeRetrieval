<br> 
<p>The shield punt system is a simple and effective way to minimize your 
opponents' net punt return yards.</p> 
<p>As an assistant coach under Lou Holtz at South Carolina, Paul Lounsberry's 
punt coverage teams faced fearsome punt returners every week in the SEC. 
Lounsberry needed a way to neutralize those returners' ability to break open a 
game with a great return. The shield punt provided exactly what he needed.</p> 
<p>The traditional punt formation has only two gunners. Everyone else is 
tasked with protecting the punter until the kick is off, which means they lose 
time they could be using to go after the returner. The basic shield punt 
formation allows for much better coverage by spreading out<b>seven gunners</b> 
on the line of scrimmage with three defenders protecting the punter.</p> 
<p>The shield punt is a simple formation that results in your opponents giving 
you fewer looks and allows you to<b>minimize practice time spent on punt 
coverage</b>. Your athletes have limited assignments which translates into 
quick learning and fewer reps in practice.</p> 
<p>Lounsberry includes fakes and an <b>innovative quick kick rugby style punt
</b> gives your punter a run/punt option.</p> 
<p>In this DVD, Lounsberry discusses the formations, assignments and 
variations of the shield punt. Detailed diagrams show you exactly how to set up 
the coverage, and game footage shows you how to execute it.</p> 
<p>Learn how to achieve better protection, better coverage and better results 
with the shield punt! DVD. 57 minutes. 2010.</p>
