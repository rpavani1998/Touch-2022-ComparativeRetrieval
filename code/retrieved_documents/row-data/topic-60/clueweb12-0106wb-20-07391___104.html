<p>Kentucky has the reputation, rightfully earned in my mind, as the most 
storied basketball program in the nation.&nbsp; TheEnes Kanter saga with its 
Byzantine complexity and massive ramifications for the future of this year's
Kentucky Wildcats team is just the latest in a long line of great stories that, 
whatever the outcome, will forever be woven into the tapestry of the most 
interesting college men's basketball program in America.</p> 
<p>Enes Kanter has alternatively become a rallying cry and a cautionary 
tale.&nbsp;&quot;Free Enes&quot;is on the lips of almost every Kentucky fan in 
America, while at the same time, foreign players considering the possibility of 
playing for American NCAA-controlled universities must be thinking that this 
avenue is being forever closed, or at&nbsp;best&nbsp;very tightly 
restricted,&nbsp;before their very eyes.</p> 
<h4>The Case For Enes Kanter's Eligibility</h4> 
<p>This has been discussed at length in comment threads, but these diverse 
opinions need to be tied together into one coherent whole.&nbsp; That's what 
we'll attempt to do here.</p> 
<p>The biggest and best argument for Enes Kanter's reinstatement has always 
been that the NCAA has previously allowed athletes who accepted money from 
agents, shoe companies, and other third parties in return for playing 
basketball to repay that money and accept a game penalty.&nbsp; These decisions 
have been almost universally based on the idea that it was never the student 
athlete's intent to &quot;professionalize&quot; himself.</p> 
<p>This is the first, and most important prong in an eligibility restoration 
debate -- were the actions by the player an &quot;intent to 
professionalize?&quot;&nbsp; It is hard to know the exact reasoning behind the 
decision by the NCAA Student-Athlete Reinstatement staff todeclare Kanter 
permanently ineligible, because they didn't release their reasoning, only their 
conclusion.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The NCAA Student-Athlete Reinstatement staff's conclusion read thus:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&quot;Enes took advantage of an opportunity to play at the highest level 
available to him, but the consequences of receiving payments above his actual 
expenses is not compatible with the collegiate model of sports that our members 
have developed,&quot; said Kevin Lennon, NCAA vice president of academic and 
membership affairs.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So does this mean that Kanter flunked the test of &quot;intent to 
professionalize?&quot;&nbsp; On what basis?&nbsp; Was it that he took too much 
money, or more the fact of where the money came from, or both?&nbsp; We don't 
really know, so that's why a discussion of this case is so very difficult other 
than in the abstract.&nbsp; We do not know exactly what one thing, or 
combination of things, made the committee reach its conclusion, or what 
particular test Kanter flunked thatRenardo Sidney and Josh Selby passed.</p> 
<p>Regardless, the appeal to the NCAA Student-Athlete Reinstatement Committee 
will be based on the following arguments, no matter what:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Kanter did not intend to professionalize himself.&nbsp; He could not have 
signed a contract due to FIBA age requirements for most of his tenure with 
Fenerbah&ccedil;e &Uuml;lker, and when he was offered a contract to play, 
apparently turned it down.</li> 
<li>Kanter's parents applied any moneys in excess of expenses to young Enes' 
education, or sequestered it in a separate account for appropriate disposition 
according to their perception of NCAA rules.</li> 
<li>The money Kanter took in excess benefits was comparatively trivial, 
especially considering most of it was used for education, a defined exception 
in the bylaws, even if the execution was flawed.&nbsp; In other words, there 
was an intent to educate, not to professionalize, and neither Enes nor his 
family used that money for any other purpose.</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition there is the news that Kentucky will try to introduce new 
evidenceinto the Kanter matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new information&nbsp;first has 
to go back to the reinstatement staff, and if their new ruling is unfavorable, 
on to the reinstatement committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this new 
information,&nbsp;we might anticipate these additional arguments, based on
reportswe have seen:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Young Kanter, due to his status as a minor, was not aware that the money 
he received was in excess of &quot;actual and necessary expenses.&quot;&nbsp; 
The logic of this is that his family was handling the finances, and it is 
rational to think that Enes would not be aware of how much money was needed for 
actual and necessary expenses since he wasn't paying the bills.&nbsp; In other 
words, this is apartial Cam Newton scenario.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As anecdotal 
evidence of how this might work, I recall in my youth having a paper route, the 
proceeds of which were to be applied to my college education.&nbsp; I never had 
any idea how much money I made, because it was handled 100% by my parents.<br>

<br>The fundamental basis of the Newton ruling was ignorance on the part of 
Cam, and just as importantly, Auburn, about the activities of Cam's father, 
Cecil Newton.&nbsp; If Cam had known and did not alert the NCAA to his father's 
activities (a tall order, no doubt), or if Auburn had been aware of his 
activities and not reported them, he would have been declared ineligible.<br>

<br>Kanter's situation is not exactly analogous, but there is a similarity in 
terms of intent.&nbsp; If young Kanter did not really know how much money he 
was receiving as far as necessary and actual expenses were concerned, he could 
have reasonably believed that he and his family were acting fully within the 
NCAA bylaws.&nbsp; This would seem to mitigate any inappropriate actions by his 
parents, just as it did in the Newton case, especially since Kanter's parents 
were apparently acting guilelessly.<br>
<br>
In addition, the NCAA takes into 
consideration knowledge of the NCAA legislation at the time of the 
violation.&nbsp; It seems very easy to argue that the Kanter's understanding of 
the bylaws would be far less than those of the parents of Cam Newton, Renardo 
Sidney or Josh Selby simply due to the fact that those worthies grew up in the 
AAU and High School ranks, where what is allowed and not allowed is force-fed 
to prospects from an early&nbsp;age.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>There is no substantive difference between earning money in the United 
States as an amateur and earning money in Europe as an amateur.&nbsp; It seems 
that the staff decision may have been at least partially based on the fact that 
the source of income was a professional team in the sport that Kanter was 
trying to play in the U.S. as an amateur.&nbsp; Money is money, and as far as 
rendering a decision on amateurism is concerned, drawing a crooked line between 
a professional team and third parties with direct ties to professional 
teams&nbsp;could&nbsp;be said to be a distinction without a difference.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It's important to note that I have no idea if all this is right or not 
vis-a-vis UK's intentions.&nbsp; It is also important to note that there are 
defensible counter-arguments to every single one of these, no matter how 
convincing they may sound.&nbsp; It is possible that the amount of money in 
question is the primary concern, and if that is so, there really isn't much to 
be done to overcome that perception.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>$33,000 may not sound like that much, but compared to Sidney and Selby, it 
is several orders of magnitude  times greater.&nbsp; Yes, I know all about the 
$20k that the Kanters spent on education, but since that was done outside the 
rules, it is easy to see that the committee may not be willing to just forget 
about that fact.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, as Eric Crawford of the Courier-Journal wrote recently, it 
is hard to know what ball to keep our eyes on.&nbsp; We really don't know the 
rationale of the reinstatement staff, and what specific facts they used to 
differentiate the Kanter case from other cases like Sidney and Selby, among 
many others.&nbsp; Hopefully, UK has a much better idea than&nbsp;we do, 
because in the end, if the Kanters and UK cannot resolve those concerns via 
prior precedent or new information, the Committee on Reinstatement is likely to 
reach the same conclusion the staff did, which is permanent ineligibility.</p>

<h5> Another thing that UK should point out to the NCAA </h5> 
<p>Is the standards set in another another NCAA sport- Tennis. Take a look at 
the rosters of the men&rsquo;s tennis teams in the SEC. Alabama has 5 players 
born outside the US. Auburn 6 (of 8 listed players). UK 3. Tennessee 4. And so 
on. Its common at almost every large school, in every major conference (and 
women&rsquo;s teams generally follow suit). You can even find it at lower 
levels of NCAA play, where you have certain D2 schools that specialize in 
loading up on foreign-born players.</p> 
<p>What difference does this make? Well, a lot of those foreign-born players 
A: Received large amounts of funds from their national tennis associations as 
teenagers to train at tennis academies, and B: Many of them have experience 
playing in PROFESSIONAL, prize money tournaments. Not to mention the fact that 
many European countries have a club system for tennis where players can make a 
nice chunk of change playing for their local club.</p> 
<p>And all of this is A-OK with the NCAA. Its been standard procedure for 
years now.</p> 
<p>The difference between this entire system and Kanter&rsquo;s case is 
splitting hairs, and really only has to do with the fact that Kanter was paid 
by a large, well-known professional organization that absolutely did not want 
him to leave. For tennis players, the funding they receive comes from some 
national association, and people go out of their way to help them hide or deny 
any prize money they might have won. Also, there is no spotlight on college 
tennis- almost no one cares. A whole lot o&rsquo; folks care about college 
bball, and there is a huge spotlight on Enes Kanter.</p> 
<p>The NCAA needs to create a clearer path for foreign players to compete in 
basketball, and Kanter has the case to set a precedent. No matter how much 
Kanter actually received, its a fact that the amount was CLEARLY millions of 
dollars less than what he could have received. If that&rsquo;s not good enough 
proof to the NCAA that Kanter meant to stay amateur, then no player good enough 
to enter a European or South American club system (the only developmental 
system available to them) will ever be able to play.</p>

<h5> Sadly ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; all of this is irrelevant.</p> 
<p>The NCAA has never considered cross-sport precedence as far as I know. They 
seem to deal only with the rules that pertain to the sport in question.</p> 
<p>Consider the fact that Trajan Langdon played four years of basketball at 
Duke while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from professional 
baseball. If you could cross the lines of sport, you would think that mattered. 
But the NCAA is noting if not consistent in applying their rules only to the 
sports for which they are directly applicable.</p> 
<p>I understand your reasoning, but the NCAA has been consistent in the way 
they insulate sports from each other. The baseball rule immediately comes to 
mind, but there are many other exceptions. All sports are not created equal to 
the NCAA, and while I know that makes it look somehow inconsistent, they seem 
to be consistent in that they simply don&rsquo;t consider cross-sport 
differences as important. If it is a rule in tennis and not a rule in 
basketball, they just don&rsquo;t care about how that looks to laypersons like 
us.</p>

<h5> The Langdon case is not germane to mjj's point </h5> 
<p>Tennis players are accepting benefits from <strong>tennis </strong>
academies or associations, not, say, soccer academies. It&rsquo;s<strong>
in-sport<strong> benefits that the NCAA finds OK for one sport, but apparently 
not for others.</strong></strong></p>

<h5> Division 1 college tennis teams </h5> 
<p>Recruit professional players, for tennis. And the NCAA looks the other way.
</p> 
<p>Going through the list of the top 5 ranked NCAA men, and crossing it with 
the ATP (professional tennis) website, I get this:</p> 
<p>John-Patrick Smith (Australian)- $3,596 earnings on Tour<br>
 Henrique 
Cunha (Brazilian) $6,009<br>
 Bradley Klahn (US born)- $34,945<br>
 Guillermo 
Gomez (Spain)- $6,022<br>
 Chase Buchanan (US)- $43,000</p> 
<p>And that ATP site only shows earnings from elite-level, ATP tour events. 
There is a whole other level of professional play below the ATP, where earnings 
are exceptionally difficult to trace.</p> 
<p>The NCAA allows this because the players &ldquo;don&rsquo;t accept the 
prize money (I smell BS)&rdquo;. In the US, this is easier to trace (probably 
why the US players I listed have higher listed earnings- they legitimately did 
not take the money). Overseas? No freaking way the NCAA can keep track of it.
</p> 
<p>You get a ton of foreign players who try to make it professionally from 
about 16-20 years old, realize its going to be nearly impossible (only a few 
hundred pro tennis players really make any decent money), so then change 
direction and come to play for US colleges, where they have a nice opportunity 
to get a free education.</p>

<h5> The NCAA does not look the other way. </h5> 
<p>They are simply applying the rules that exist. You may not agree with their 
interpretation of their rules, but ultimately, as long as they are consistent 
within their respective sports, it&rsquo;s hard to see the problem.</p>

<h5> I understand. </h5> 
<p>My point, though, is that the NCAA doesn&rsquo;t care. It separates sports. 
What&rsquo;s within the rules in one sport is not so in another.</p> 
<p>If a basketball player accepts money for playing tennis, he can still play 
basketball as an amateur, theoretically, and the same with the reverse.</p> 
<p>I get that it seems inconsistent, but it&rsquo;s not as if that decision 
comes from &ldquo;on high.&rdquo; The colleges themselves have made these 
rules. They are what they are. They may not seem &ldquo;fair,&rdquo; but then 
again, you can attend college anytime you want to, assuming academic 
qualifications, as a professional player of any sport. You just can&rsquo;t get 
a scholarship or play on the university&rsquo;s team in the case of some.</p>

<h5> The NCAA might not look the other way </h5> 
<p>But they are being stunningly hypocritical. The statement their sending out 
is basically this:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We are the NCAA. We are all about amateur athletics. At least in 
certain sports. In others? Ehh, not so much&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Same organization/governing body, same stated mission for all sports, 
totally random and different standards for different sports? Really great way 
to go about your business.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason people hate and distrust the NCAA. They are a 
farce, and they&rsquo;ve made themselves into that.</p>

<h5> You do realize ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; that the NCAA is Kentucky. It is Louisville. It is every Division 
I school.</p> 
<p>I think so many people look at the NCAA as somehow distinct in itself, but 
it isn&rsquo;t. Kentucky helps make these rules. As does every other NCAA 
school.</p> 
<p>Hypocritical? Not really. The NCAA enforces a stricter money ban for some 
sports than others, but in the final analysis, they allow some money to be 
taken by all. I would agree that the NCAA&rsquo;s current definition of 
&ldquo;amateur&rdquo; needs to be updated and refined, but mostly people 
distrust them becuase they don&rsquo;t explain themselves, and when they do, it 
is in long, legal-sounding documents that make people think of lawyers.</p>

<h5> I realize it </h5> 
<p>I realize that the NCAA is a bunch of college presidents who run an 
allegedly non-profit &hellip;&hellip;(pause as I try to catch my breath from 
laughing so hard), allegedly amateur organization, that rakes in billions of 
dollars through running highly professionalized, quasi-amateur football and 
basketball programs, under the auspices of institutions allegedly devoted to 
higher education.</p> 
<p>I call that hypocrisy. Or rank cynicism. Or both.</p> 
<p>And when those same people allow foreign pros in one sport, but not 
another, it only makes them look more hypocritical.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that UK should go in guns a blazin&rsquo;. I can blaze 
my own guns, but UK probably needs to meet their lawyers with more lawyeriness. 
I am saying that, seeing as how the rules about foreign basketball players with 
professional backgrounds are clearly in flux, that UK might want to at least 
raise the question as to why, exactly, there needs to be a double-standard 
between sports that are controlled by the same governing body?</p> 
<p>It seems a legit question.</p>

<h5> Now that I've returned home and can refer to the Division I manual ... 
</h5> 
<p>&hellip; I see that your charge of hypocrisy is not really accurate. Tennis 
and golf amateurs are not allowed to receive more than &ldquo;actual or 
necessary&rdquo; expenses, just like basketball players.</p> 
<p>Sorry, but I think you have misread the bylaws, and I was wrong when I said 
they are stricter on some sports than others. They aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<h5> Ideal versus reality </h5> 
<p>Same rules might apply, but the actual result is dramatically different.</p>
<p>Kanter is coming from a large, well-known organization that is actively 
working against his desire to play college basketball. Tennis players come out 
of a background that is loosely structured, and people go out of their way to 
help them meet NCAA regulations (meaning, basically, they help them hide or 
channel the money).</p> 
<p>If you want to defend the NCAA, that&rsquo;s your prerogative. They 
certainly have a leg to stand on when declaring Kanter ineligible. I think they 
have a leg to stand on no matter what they decide, because the rules are so 
arbitrarily enforced that they can defend any decision they make. Like with Cam 
Newton. Or Selby. Or Sidney.</p> 
<p>And I think the NCAA is hypocritical to its very core, for reasons I 
mentioned above. So we&rsquo;ll just have to agree to disagree on this one.</p>

<p>&hellip; that you have not proven any of your allegations, you&rsquo;re

<p>That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;m used to that, but all I&rsquo;m asking you to 
do is demonstrate some reasonable evidence of impropriety. So far, all 
you&rsquo;ve done is make a bunch of claims of hypocrisy, but it turns out 
those charges aren&rsquo;t demonstrably accurate.</p>

expenses for a tennis player.</p>

<h5> Factual vacuum? </h5> 
<p>No.</p> 
<p>Tons of college tennis players have ATP ratings. Tons of college players 
are listed as having earned ATP prize money. As I showed above ( I can make a 
much, much longer list, but its pointless). Yet until just this past summer, 
any foreign-born player who earned one red cent playing basketball was 
permanently ineligible. Even participating in what the NCAA deemed a 
professional league, without receiving payment of any kind, resulted in a 
lengthy suspension.</p> 
<p>I am not a believer in the &ldquo;Because its the rules&rdquo; argument. 
When any organization has to resort to that argument too often, its an obvious 
sign that the rules are either wildly inconsistent in how they&rsquo;re 
composed, or being applied in a wildly inconsistent, illogical manner.</p> 
<p>Like the NCAA.</p> 
<p>So if the rules basically encourage tennis athletes who have been trained 
as professionals, and have played as professionals, to come on over and play 
for old state U, while completely disallowing it for basketball, I call it 
hypocritical.</p>

<h5> I guess I'm missing the point ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; as to how an ATP ranking is an NCAA violation. You claim they are 
earning &ldquo;prize money,&rdquo; but the NCAA rules state that they may earn 
money as long as it isn&rsquo;t in excess of actual or necessary expenses 
&mdash; just like basketball players.</p> 
<blockquote> Yet until just this past summer, any foreign-born player who 
earned one red cent playing basketball was permanently ineligible.</blockquote> 
<p>According to my reading of 12.2.3.1, prior to this year, reasonable and 
necessary expenses were not allowed. This year they are. It worked the same way 
for tennis and basketball players then, and now.</p> 
<p>Once again, I am missing the part where something is hypocritical here. 
Prior to 2010, the rules were the same &mdash; no money allowed. After 2010, 
the rules are the same &mdash; reasonable and necessary expenses allowed.</p> 
<blockquote> So if the rules basically encourage tennis athletes who have been 
trained as professionals, and have played as professionals, to come on over and 
play for old state U, while completely disallowing it for basketball, I call it 
hypocritical.</blockquote> 
<p>That would be so if it were true. It is not, as I&rsquo;ve just explained 
above. Basketball players are allowed participation with professional teams as 
long as they don&rsquo;t accept money in excess of reasonable and necessary 
expenses, just like tennis players.</p>

<h5> How were the rules the same? They weren't </h5> 
<p>Kilicli was suspended around 20 games at WVU for participating in 
competitions with professional teammates (not receiving any cash). That rule 
has been changed, but just this past summer.</p> 
<p>If you have an ATP ranking, and listed ATP earnings, how, exactly, have you 
not been competing with tennis professionals? And that has been going on for 
years, not just since this past summer, when the rules for basketball were 
modified.</p> 
<p>The rules might be more equivalent now, but they weren&rsquo;t until very 
recently. And the practical application of them has the exact result I&rsquo;ve 
been speaking of- its very easy for foreign-born tennis players with 
professional experience to be eligible for D1 tennis, but its still 
exceptionally difficult for foreign-born basketball players with any 
professional experience to do so.</p>

<h5> Last year ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; individual sports players could compete with pros and remain 
eligible as long as they didn&rsquo;t take any money. This year, they can 
accept &ldquo;reasonable and necessary expenses.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Also, if prize money is earned but not taken by the player, their amateur 
status is not affected. That&rsquo;s the same as retaining amateur status in 
golf &mdash; you may participate in a professional event and win prize money, 
as long as you don&rsquo;t accept the cash. That would still register as money 
earned, even if you don&rsquo;t take it. I assume tennis is similar.</p> 
<p>The rules were different for team sports, in that competition on pro teams 
wasn&rsquo;t allowed. But neither team nor individual were allowed to accept 
money before this year, even expenses.</p> 
<p>You may argue that it&rsquo;s inconsistent for team sports not to have been 
able to play with pros pre-2010 and I might agree. But that seems a minor thing 
to me, which is now corrected.</p>

<p>For professional skiing. The issue wasn&rsquo;t his receiving money as a 
professional for salary (which the NCAA had no problem with), but his receipt 
of money for endorsements which the NCAA does not allow. His &ldquo;fame&rdquo; 
in college football could certainly have influenced his endorsement deals 
(especially with sales in and around Colorado U), thus he&rsquo;d be making 
money not only off of skiing, but off of college football.</p>

<h5> The NCAA definition of &quot;pay for play&quot; </h5> 
<p>is not the same as a fans definition. The NCAA has taken the stance that 
the source of the pay matters in a number of cases (including Kanter&rsquo;s).
</p> 
<p>I think they can make a logical case that his endorsement deals could be 
affected by him playing college football. Does he get extra football gear from 
a sponsor like Nike? Do sales of the product he&rsquo;&rsquo;s sponsoring go up 
dramatically around the Colorado U campus because of his football fame? Do the 
radio/TV announcers start talking about his skiing ability and his sponsorships 
on the air in the middle of the football game? In Bloom&rsquo;s case (and why I 
know of him), he was good enough at football to make the NFL, but suffered 
injuries that stopped him from competing. The difficulty in allowing 
endorsements is that they are created from a person&rsquo;s fame. As minor as 
it may seem, his fame in football may affect his endorsements. If even one 
dollar of that endorsement money comes from him playing football (whether 
it&rsquo;s directly stated or just &ldquo;understood&rdquo; to be that way), it 
is an improper benefit. The only way the NCAA can ensure that doesn&rsquo;t 
happen is to disallow all sponsorships. Bloom knew this stance would be taken 
by the NCAA because he worked with them on the subject before choosing to take 
the sponsorships anyway. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right or wrong, 
I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s a defensible position for them to take and I 
don&rsquo;t think it at all invalidates Glenn&rsquo;s argument.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anyone understands it. I&rsquo;ve read that Selby is

Pell Grant money available in the event he had to repay the benefits that he 
had received from the Cliftons. Admittedly, the Wall situation involved only 
$800.00 or so, and the Selby situation involves quite a bit more money. It was 
my understanding that Wall had to pay the money back before he would start 
serving his suspension of 2 games.</p>

<h5> I'm suspect of the argument </h5> 
<p>that Kanter, as a minor, could be considered unaware of excess expenses. I 
can easily see the NCAA ruling that Kanter&rsquo;s parents, as legal guardians 
at the time, were an extension of Enes because they had legal authority to do 
things in his name. I think your final paragraph in the matter is a better 
argument: they simply didn&rsquo;t have sufficient knowledge of the rules and 
shouldn&rsquo;t have been expected to be able to follow them as well as someone 
like Newton.</p> 
<p>Just from a technical standpoint: Kanter&rsquo;s money received is not, in 
fact, &ldquo;orders of magnitude&rdquo; greater than Sidney&rsquo;s or 
Selby&rsquo;s. It is about a single order of magnitude greater than Selby, and 
about one-half an order of magnitude greater than Sidney. Your point remains 
the same, however. It is a significantly greater amount of money received. I 
would be curious what the NCAA considers &ldquo;too much&rdquo; to suspend and 
repay should this point be the source of their ruling.</p>

<h5> Heh. </h5> 
<p>I blew the &ldquo;orders of magnitude&rdquo; thing between edits.</p> 
<p>I started to say, &ldquo;an order of magnitude,&rdquo; then decided to 
change it to &ldquo;several times.&rdquo; The two got mixed with inaccurate 
results. Thanks for pointing that out.</p> 
<p>As I said, there are defensible counter-arguments to every single argument 
I made without exception. The NCAA declined to consider Cam Newton&rsquo;s 
father an extension of him, although an argument could be made that since Cam 
was of age, he wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p> 
<p>As far as money goes, we know that $11,000 or so is not too much, but we 
know that only in the context of US players. What we do not know is if the NCAA 
is likely to apply that &ldquo;too much&rdquo; standard differently based on 
the source of the income, or if there is some bright line they have in mind. In 
other words, $11,000 may not be too much from a shoe company, but $500 might be 
too much from a professional team directly.</p>

<h5> The science teacher in me comes out sometimes </h5>

Kanter to &ldquo;win&rdquo; on whatever basis they can, the NCAA can certainly 
make a logical case in either direction.</p> 
<p>You make a great point regarding the source of the money. Based on the 
statement in the initial ruling, it seems likely to me that the hangup in the 
Kanter case is the source, not the amount.</p>

reason Nike or an agent is giving a person money is because they&rsquo;re good 
at playing ball &ndash; same as a team. I doubt we&rsquo;ll see the NCAA take 
that position.</p> 
<p>This kind of reasoning is exactly why I think Kanter has a better shot in 
the appeals committee: Let the members directly decide the outcome and set the 
precedent. Then, how can they possibly complain about the decision when it came 
from their own members rather than the bureaucracy?</p>

<h5> Who's perception? </h5> 
<p>The fans, or the member schools? I think it is more difficult for the NCAA 
to rule him eligible and be perceived as reasonable by the member schools than 
it is to rule him ineligible. The NCAA has to have some very resounding reason 
to allow Kanter to play &ndash; member schools will otherwise see nothing but 
the fact that he was paid money by a pro team.</p> 
<p>In general, fans don&rsquo;t make much difference with regard to their 
perceptions. Do you think your version of &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the Kanter case is the same as a Duke or Louisville 
fan? The NCAA will likely never be perceived by fans as reasonable.</p>

<h5> I do think ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; and I have said, that the NCAA does not care what the fans think.
</p> 
<p>That is not their &ldquo;client,&rdquo; if you will.</p> 
<p>But you are undoubtedly right.</p> 
<p>However, I would suggest that the root cause of that frustration is a 
failure, and even a deliberate lack of intent, of the fans to educate 
themselves about a given situation for which they have a beef. I know, because 
I used to be that way.</p> 
<p>But then I decided to make sure I was correct. I discovered, to my chagrin, 
that I had been guilty of seeing situations through anti-NCAA glasses.</p> 
<p>Live and learn. I would prefer to find fault with the NCAA all the time, 
but because I decided to refuse to ignore the facts in favor of 
broadly-reasoned themes that the NCAA simply doesn&rsquo;t buy, I discovered 
that they were really a lot more reasonable in Indianapolis than I imagined.</p>

<h5> Ultimately </h5> 
<p>the fans are their client because it is the money from the fans that they, 
and the universities they represent, are lusting after more and more. I 
don&rsquo;t think they are anywhere near a rebellion that in any way threatens 
their current status but if they lose enough credibility who knows?</p>

<h5> I see your point ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; in the abstract. There is no real doubt that if vast numbers of 
fans across the country tried to affect NCAA regulations by acting as a 
cohesive whole, they could. But that is true of any human endeavor.</p> 
<p>The reality, though, is that the member universities are the ones who elect 
the body and pay their salary. It is they who write the rules that are enforced 
among members. The member universities have a significant financial interest, 
both individually and collectively.</p> 
<p>The fans also have an interest, both financially and emotionally, although 
that interest is so diluted by comparison to the institutions that their power 
is almost impossible to muster except in very rare situations.</p> 
<p>In the final analysis, the NCAA seems happy to worry about their 
membership, and trusts that membership to take care of their fans.</p>

<h5> I don't know. </h5> 
<p>My perception is that fans tend to complain about the NCAA without really 
trying to understand their reasoning. If it doesn&rsquo;t pass their initial 
perception of what &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; aught to look like, that&rsquo;s it 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s unfair, wrong, evil, corrupt, or worse.</p> 
<p>My thing is this &mdash; don&rsquo;t make claims, make arguments. Bring 
proof. Cite bylaws, cite examples of cases where the NCAA has not followed a 
reasonable process.</p> 
<p>Look, the NCAA sometimes takes positions with which I disagree, and I can 
lay down a ton of reasons why. That doesn&rsquo;t make me right. Most of the 
time, it boils down to a difference of opinion.</p> 
<p>A difference of opinion does not make one evil, or corrupt, especially if 
both are defensible.</p>

<p>Cam Newton. Again all I can cite at the present is appearance. It appears 
that he is too valuable a draw for the NCAA to come down on. After all is said 
and done, the investigators may find that Auburn and Cam or his father have 
some issues after all. The money will have been made, Auburn will have gambled 
and lost and the NCAA rolls on. This case does not make the argument that the 
NCAA is on the up and up any easier.</p>

<h5> Educational expenses </h5> 
<p>It started with Mike DeCourcy on Nov. 11: &ldquo;The NCAA told the family 
that Fenerbahce would have needed to pay for those expenses directly for them 
to be permissible.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s contrary to Rule 12.1.2.1.3.1, which says rather clearly 
(after several readings) that professional sports teams/organationzations<em>
may not</em>provide educational expenses or services to prospective 
student-athletes. Neither may agents, universities or boosters, for reasons a 
little reflection makes obvious.</p> 
<p>But UK fans have latched onto this idea that diverting impermissible 
benefits to education is a mitigating factor. Quite the contrary, imo. Using 
impermissible benefits to commit another violation of the rules only 
exacerbates the offense.</p> 
<p>It could be that the educational expenses are causing all the trouble. 
After the staff&rsquo;s initial decision, Calipari mentioned how the 
Kanter&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong to use the money that way. And 
it&rsquo;s abundantly clear to me that he knows this case, the applicable rules 
and the NCAA&rsquo;s thinking far more than he has been willing to share.</p> 
<p>This is the only tangible benefit Enes received, an education paid for by a 
professional basketball team. That distinguishes him from Newton in an 
important way. But if personal responsibility means anything, the principle in 
Newton&rsquo;s reinstatement should apply here, not to exonerate Kanter, but to 
reduce the penalty from permanent ban to the usual suspension and repayment of 
impermissible benefits.</p> 
<p> by Wheatgerm on  Dec 7, 2010 4:52 PM EST reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> The language in this rule was changed after Kanter had left FU </h5> 
<p>While Kanter was with the pro team, the rule stated:</p> 
<p>12.1.2.1.3 Educational Expenses. Educational expenses not permitted by the 
governing legislation of this Association (see Bylaw 15 regarding permissible 
financial aid to enrolled student-athletes).</p> 
<p>12.1.2.1.3.1.2 Educational Expenses&mdash;Professional Team or League. An 
individual may receive educational expenses awarded by a professional team or 
league, in accordance with the applicable conditions set forth in Bylaw 
15.2.5.6.</p> 
<p>15.2.5.6 Educational Expenses&mdash;Professional Team or League. A former 
professional athlete may receive educational expenses from a professional team 
or league, provided the following conditions are met:<br>
 (a) The 
student-athlete no longer is involved in professional athletics;<br>
 (b) The 
student-athlete is not receiving any remuneration from a professional sports 
organization;<br>
 &copy; The student-athlete does not have an active 
contractual relationship with any professional athletics team, although the 
student-athlete may remain bound by an option clause (i.e., a clause in the 
contract that requires assignment to a particular team, if the 
student-athlete&rsquo;s professional athletics career is resumed);<br>
 (d) 
Disbursement of the aid shall be through the member institution for the 
recipient&rsquo;s educational expenses while attending that institution;<br>
 
(e) The value of the award alone or in combination with other aid per Bylaw 
15.1.1 shall not exceed the value of a full grant-in-aid; and<br>
 (f ) The 
recipient shall be considered a counter per Bylaw 15.5.1, and the amount shall 
be applied to the maximum award limitations of Bylaw 15.5 for the sport in 
question.</p> 
<p>Based on D, Kanter broke the rule because FU didn&rsquo;t pay the expenses 
directly, and he broke E because he received more than necessary to pay for 
education. Given that Kanter played for FU during the period in which this was 
the specified rules, it was likely argued by UK that Kanter be grandfathered in 
under the old interpretation, though he still was in violation of the rule in 
action, if not intent.</p>

<h5> &quot;these were&quot;, not &quot;this was&quot; </h5>

<p> by dshnarw on  Dec 7, 2010 6:06 PM EST up reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> You make an excellent point about what regulations were in effect at the 
time, dsh. </h5> 
<p>The $33,033 in excess expense occurred in the 2008-09 season, according to 
the NCAA&rsquo;s Nov.11 press release. And it was from this excess, according 
to Mike DeCourcy, that the Kanters used nearly $20k for their son&rsquo;s 
education. So what we want are the NCAA rules that were in place during 
Ulker&rsquo;s 2008-09 season. As both the Euroleague and Beko basketball league 
schedules begin in October, we want the 2008-09 NCAA Division I Manual, 
effective August 1, 2008.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m using Rule 12.1.2.1.3.1 from that manual. The provision was 
adopted on 4/25/02, made effective 8/1/02 and only slightly revised to its 
present form on 1/14/08. So it has been the basic rule on &ldquo;Educational 
Expenses or Services &ndash; Prior to Collegiate Enrollment&rdquo; for the last 
eight years.</p> 
<p>Check which manual you&rsquo;re using, dsh, because it&rsquo;s possible 
that the rule you quote comes from a Division II Manual. Rule 12.1.2.1.3.2.2 
from the 2008-09 Division II Manual states: An individual may receive 
educational expenses awarded by a professional team or league, in accordance 
with the applicable conditions set forth in Bylaw 15.2.5.6. (Adopted: 1/13/03 
effective 8/1/03) Naturally we want the rules for Division I.</p> 
<p>The rule that I <em>believe </em>is applicable states that a prospective 
student-athlete may receive educational expenses or services from any individual
<em>other than </em>a professional sports team/organization (and the few other 
entities), and then goes on to place a limitation on those who are permitted to 
provide such expenses.</p> 
<p>So any educational expense paid by an outside sports team or organization, 
prior to or after collegiate enrollment, was and is classified as a 
&ldquo;prohibited form of pay.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem. By rule, Kanter received a prohibited form of 
pay from a professional basketball team. How do you argue your way out of that 
one? If Sandy Bell can pull this off, I will stand and applaud. After I compose 
myself from all the screaming and dancing around.</p>

<p>The thing that still gets me about that press release, dshnarw: it never

wasn&rsquo;t the finding. If they determined he was a pro, if that&rsquo;s the 
reason for the punishment, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to 
say so. But they didn&rsquo;t. Why?</p>

<h5> Therein lies </h5> 
<p>the best argument for eligibility. The transaction was between adults, not 
Enes, a minor at the time. Even if he was aware that money was given and set 
aside for his education, he was in no position to make the decision for 
himself. It just seems like a PR nightmare for the NCAA to allow athletes whose 
family members are on the take to continue to play and deny Enes under his 
circumstances. Technically correct, yes but fair and equal treatment of

<h5> Great Article. </h5> 
<p>Good point 1972. Cal has not actually had time to really 
&ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; the UK program. He immediately got awsome players in his 
first year and we were back. I see this year as more of a rebuilding year. We 
have some great freshman again but they all may not go pro at the end of the 
year this time. We know we have another killer class for 2011. If we retain 
some young guys from this year and return Miller and Liggins as senoirs. We are 
in a great place for 2011. This is the perfect year for Cal to gamble a bit on 
a guy like Kanter. Personally I&rsquo;m giving Cal a chance to build up an 
actual team for a real run at the chapionship. I think 2011 is our best shot in 
a long time and the Kanter deal will be long forgotten. Unless of course he 
returns for some crazy reason, like say a lockout.</p>

<h5> Agree, but I think you missed a huge issue here. </h5> 
<p>2009 was &ldquo;our best shot in a long time&rdquo; to win a NC. I admit, I 
drink the Blue-Aid when it comes to football, but I am a basketball realist. 
Anyone, and I mean anyone who thinks last year&rsquo;s team shouldn&rsquo;t 
have hung a banner in RUPP is either lying to themselves or still recovering 
from the Clyde hangover. This year&rsquo;s team is good, and they could be 
great. If Orton had stayed, Kanter becomes eligible, and so on. This team could 
be awesome. Next year could be the exact same. We are all hoping some players 
stick around this year, but what if Poole and Hood leave? Why wouldn&rsquo;t 
they? Hood saw about as many minutes last year, and Polson is getting in before 
Poole these days. I am not telling these young men to look to transfer, but 
what if? And if I saw the guys coming in, the guys that might stay, there is no 
way I would think my playing time would improve next year. I appreciate 
everyone&rsquo;s optimism and looking for the future, but we should be asking 
about when we are going to hang #9 this year and not #8.</p> 
<p>I am not asking for Cal&rsquo;s head or anything, and I do believe he will 
win one in the next few years. I also agree that he needs to have some time to 
get his guys in and get his system going. BUT the little coaching I have seen 
thus far in the year has been abysmal. Coach lost the UNC game, not the 
players. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t happen come tourney time, but watch the first 
3 minutes of the game and tell me if UNC&rsquo;s game plan wasn&rsquo;t 
perfectly clear. Get our bigs in foul trouble and the rest will fall into 
place. Fast forward to the last 10 minutes of that game. What was UK&rsquo;s 
game plan? Hold the ball and keep it close. We all know how that worked out.</p>
<p>Again, I am not wishing for another Coach by any means. I love what Cal has 
done for the program in his short tenure. I would always rather be feared and 
hated than pitied. But maybe Mitch could hire an &ldquo;in-game&rdquo; 
assistant that could teach coach a thing or two. Could you even imagine Tubby 
coaching Cal&rsquo;s recruits??? I guarantee not a single fan would be 
complaining about Tubby winning with another coaches recruits ever again. ;)</p>

<h5> I guess I must be lying to </h5> 
<p>myself then because I don&rsquo;t think they &ldquo;should have hung a 
banner&rdquo;, I think they could have just like several other teams in the 
NCAA field. Many things happen in a tournament and teams that &ldquo;should 
have&rdquo; don&rsquo;t more often then not. It was not our right to win nor 
our destiny. I think it is much too presumptuous to think it was ours to lose. 
We are one of many good programs and it will not be easy to win #8. Duke was 
one miracle heave of a basketball away from going home runners-up.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Abysmal as a description of our coaching is absurd. Unrealistic

<h5> Right kywineman. </h5> 
<p>Cal is not perfect but abysmal no. I hate to say it but Orton was no good 
for UK this year either way. He quit going to class his last semester. Not the 
kind of leader we need. Plus he has been injured off and on all this year. Now 
if Patterson stayed then we have something. I understand why he left but 
I&rsquo;m sure he thinks from time to time that he would rather be back at UK 
than playing D-league ball.<br>
 I understand the argument that 09 should have 
won that NC. But it was so tough with a new staff and a new team of freshmen. 
I&rsquo;m thinking Cal is building something this year. Yes we may loose a few 
guys that don&rsquo;t play but our core experienced players will be ready to 
roll. I think our future looks pretty good.</p>

<h5> The players didn't lose this game? </h5> 
<p>If Kanter was on the floor, do you think UK would have lost? Do you think 
Zeller would have scored 27pts? And if you watched Cal&rsquo;s comments after 
the game, he clearly said he told his guys not to foul Zeller, and they did 
anyway. You can be the greatest coach in the game, but if nobody listens, it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<h5> Did you see this on KSR? Bizarre stat of the year: </h5> 
<p>Harrellson has played 162 minutes this year. That&rsquo;s 2 hours and 42 
minutes on the court.</p> 
<p>And he has not shot a single free throw.</p>

<h5> There is a difference between asking your players not to foul and being 
ready for a team. </h5> 
<p>I think one of Cal&rsquo;s greatest strengths is getting his players to 
listen to him and turning a bunch of kids used to playing for themselves into 
playing as a unit and for a team.</p> 
<p>Explain the lack of offense in the last 10 minutes of the game or for that 
matter, the entire UCONN game. Was that the players not listening as well?</p> 
<p>And as for Kanter playing, what does that matter? If UK had Kobe on the 
team last year, he probably hits 1 three in the WV game and they win. 
Doesn&rsquo;t really matter. He wasn&rsquo;t and Kanter isn&rsquo;t (yet).</p>

<h5> Relevant Commentary </h5> 
<p>This ESPN piece provides a bit of insight into the process (excerpt):<br>

</p> 
<blockquote> &ldquo;If more information comes to light as a result of the 
enforcement staff or institution&rsquo;s investigation, and that information is 
credible and contradicts the prior facts that were used to base the 
reinstatement decision, then that information would need to go back to the 
reinstatement staff,&rdquo; Lach said.</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>My own thought: If one thinks that the urgency of the SEC championship game 
and its likely impact on the BCS title didn&rsquo;t influence the Newton 
decision then that person is deserving of the Naif of The Year Award &mdash; so 
much for the inscrutable NCAA.</p> 
<p>&quot;I bring reason to your ears, and, in language as plain as ABC, hold 
up truth to your eyes.&quot; Thomas Paine, December 23, 1776</p> 
<p> by Wild Weasel on  Dec 7, 2010 8:54 PM EST reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> Indeed. </h5> 
<p>There is no real doubt that the timing of the situation was a major factor 
in the Newton decision, and even if the NCAA didn&rsquo;t say so, it is right 
there for everyone but a mental midget to see.</p> 
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest &mdash; if Kanter were eligible and we were about 
to get a #1 seed in the NCAA championship and a similar situation reared its 
head, I prefer to believe that the NCAA would use an equal sense of all 
possible speed to reach a resolution.</p> 
<p>We may never know if that is so, though, so the reader&rsquo;s mileage may 
vary on that comment. :-)</p>

<h5> I just read this on another site, </h5> 
<blockquote> So, did the NCAA&rsquo;s ruling &ldquo;fall on the side of the 
student-athletes&rdquo; when they punished current USC players (banned from 
post-season play for 2 years) for the alleged actions of individuals who 
haven&rsquo;t been students for years????</blockquote> 
<p>This guy makes the point that athletes at schools banned from post season 
play are being punished for the actions of others that they knew nothing about, 
the very reason the NCAA gives for allowing Cam to play on. This joke is not 
getting any funnier.</p> 
<p>I woke up feeling BLUE this morning. It's gonna be a great day.</p> 
<p> by kywineman on  Dec 7, 2010 11:04 PM EST up reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> Yeah. </h5> 
<p>This is a long-running complaint, and a lamentable one. It&rsquo;s very 
similar to how it used to be when I was in boot camp &mdash; when one dirtbag 
messed up, we all paid the price.</p> 
<p>The NCAA&rsquo;s ruling is very rarely about student-athletes. As I have 
explained, it is only the nexus of the athlete with their member university 
that makes them matter, and the constituency of the NCAA is the member 
universities, not the athletes.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s just reality. As a matter of fact, though, none of the USC 
players are really being punished. Every one of them could elect to go to 
another school without penalty, but they realize that they&rsquo;ll get just as 
much TV time (if that&rsquo;s what they want) or the opportunity to compete at 
the same level sans bowl game even if they stay.</p> 
<p>The possibility of NCAA punishment is part and parcel of the college 
athletics experience. Just as nobody is guaranteed the school will field a 
football team or renew a scholarship year by year, nobody is guaranteed a 
smooth ride vis-a-vis the NCAA.</p> 
<p>This complaint does not move me. Life happens. What better time to learn 
about that than in college? :-)</p>

<h5> I just think </h5> 
<p>there are punishments that would be fair to the athletes. Fine the 
university, remove the offending athlete and/or coach if he/she is still there 
and play on.</p> 
<p>I like your analogy of boot camp, been there, done that. There is one key 
distinction between the two circumstances though, in boot camp there was 
opportunity for one&rsquo;s peers to &ldquo;influence&rdquo; the actions of the 
offenders.</p>

<h5> Presumably ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; that is also available to athletes, n&rsquo;est ce pas? They could 
always turn the offender in. If they know, of course, which I suspect many did 
know in the case of Bush.</p>

<p>Ok say Enes is reinstated but not before mid Jan. but also NCAA makes him 
sit out some games say 5 or 6. &amp; he does so so with the cats this year. 
does he come back next year or does he try for the NBA anyway?</p>

<h5> He should be a lottery pick this year. </h5> 
<p>He really wants to play for UK though. His parents have money and he has 
turned down a big payday before. So there is a chance he would stay. Plus if 
there is a lockout he may need to stay. Then there is Cal who will no doubt 
encourage him to go pro. So who knows. Lot of factors in that. Fun to think 
about it.</p>

<h5> UK NCAA Paranoia </h5> 
<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion that if Cam Newton had been UK&rsquo;s QB, instead 
of Auburn&rsquo;s that indeed mirroring all the circumstances that took place 
at Auburn, he would had been declared ineligible by the NCAA no matter if our 
FB record and ranking equaled theirs.<br>
