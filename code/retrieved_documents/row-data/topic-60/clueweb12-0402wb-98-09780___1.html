<h1>The truth is that there is a great deal of careless driving and there are 
many near-misses - for which we are nearly all responsible.</h1>

</h2> 
<p>The speeding ticket I got the other week was one I deserved - totally. I'd 
been way over the 30-kilometre limit. In a school zone, yet. Okay, it was 
summer: No kids at school. Still.</p> 
<p>&quot;You could have killed someone,&quot; the officer said. He was right.
</p> 
<p>My driving record was otherwise unblemished, I said. He didn't care. 
&quot;I'm not even going to check.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fines and demerit points have a way of focusing the mind - mine anyway. So 
does sitting in your car on a busy street with a cruiser behind you, lights 
flashing. It's humiliating - people peering into your car and all. It's meant 
to be.</p> 
<p>I like to think of myself as a courteous, conscientious driver. I signal 
before turning, am mindful in the car - of cyclists and pedestrians and other 
vehicles - and I watch the road.</p> 
<p>Me and everyone else. In study after study, it seems, when groups of 
drivers were asked to compare themselves to the average driver, a majority 
responded that they were better, Tom Vanderbilt reports in his compelling new 
book about driving, Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (And What It Says About 
Us) (Alfred A. Knopf, 402 pp, $29.95). &quot;This is, of course, statistically 
quite improbable,&quot; observes the Brooklyn-based writer.</p> 
<p>In fact, as he explains, we are way more distracted and distractible than 
we acknowledge - or even could acknowledge, since one reason we inflate our 
driving abilities may well be that we can't accurately judge them to begin 
with. Polls on aggressive driving, for instance, report more people seeing it 
than doing it. &quot;Someone is self-enhancing,&quot; Vanderbilt writes.</p> 
<p>Thinking that we're above average helps to explain our initial resistance 
to such safety measures as cellphone restrictions, he suggests. &quot;We 
overestimate the risk to society and we underestimate our own risk,&quot; he 
writes. &quot;It is the other person's behaviour that needs to be controlled, 
not mine.&quot;</p> 
<p>But the truth is that there is a great deal of careless driving and there 
are many near-misses - and that we are nearly all responsible. &quot;Human 
attention, in the best of circumstances, is a fluid but fragile entity,&quot; 
as Vanderbilt writes.</p> 
<p>I have rummaged through my purse on occasion while driving and once, while 
fiddling with the radio dial on a winter night, I came within a hair's breadth 
of hitting the car in front of me. Not infrequently, I drive in excess of the 
speed limit - not much, but over it. The July morning I was stopped for 
speeding, I was so focused on getting to where I was headed I didn't even 
notice the police cruiser tailing me down the curving mountain road. It was 
cavalier of me - and stupid.</p> 
<p>Before the provincial ban on hand-held cellphones was introduced in Quebec 
in April, I talked on my cellphone while driving way more than I needed to. 
(Now, I almost always pull over - not because of the spectre of a $115 fine and 
three demerits if I'm caught but, more important, because I have realized 
nothing is so crucial that it can't wait for me to stop driving to say or hear 
it.)</p> 
<p>The risk of having a traffic accident while using a cellular phone is the 
same as the risk while driving drunk, according to a Canadian study that 
appeared in New England Journal of Medicine back in 1997, and hands-free phones 
appear to be no safer than the hand-held ones. Other studies since have found 
the same thing.</p> 
<p>&quot;The impairments aren't because your hands aren't on the wheel. It's 
because your mind isn't on the road,&quot; David Strayer, a psychology 
professor at the University of Utah told Katharine Mieszkowski of Salon.com a 
couple of weeks ago.</p> 
<p>And yet, human nature is such that the longer we go without crashing our 
cars or hurting someone, the more strongly reinforced our risky behaviour 
becomes.</p> 
<p>&quot;As an average driver, you can get away with a lot before it catches 
up with you,&quot; John Lee, head of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at the 
University of Iowa told Vanderbilt. &quot;You could drive for years with a 
cellphone and say, 'How can cellphones be dangerous, because I do it every day 
for two hours and nothing's happened?' Well, that's because you've been 
lucky.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We all get reinforced the wrong way,&quot; said Bruce Moeller, CEO of 
Drivecam, a San Diego-based company which installs cameras around the rear-view 
mirrors of commercial vehicles. When a driver brakes hard or turns suddenly, 
the camera's record of the 10 seconds before and after the event is sent to 
company analysts. Crash rates in Drivecam-equipped vehicles have dropped 
significantly.</p> 
<p>As he watched footage of crashes, near-crashes and careless driving, 
Vanderbilt observed that more often than not, it's not that unforeseen things 
happen for no good reason but that people do things that make crashes more 
likely or even unpreventible.</p> 
<p>In one case, a driver looked down to dial a cellphone while driving along a 
residential street; his eyes were off the road for most of the nine seconds of 
the recorded event; as his van began to leave the road, he swerved. Less than a 
dozen feet away was a child on a bicycle; a friend was nearby, just off the 
road. The distracted driver hadn't seen them.</p> 
<p>&quot;Not only was the guy unaware of the real hazards he was subjecting 
himself and others to in the way he was driving,&quot; Vanderbilt writes, 
&quot;he was not even aware that he was unaware.&quot;</p> 
<p>The same was true of me the morning I was stopped for speeding, I am afraid 
- and it is true of too many of us, way too often.</p>
