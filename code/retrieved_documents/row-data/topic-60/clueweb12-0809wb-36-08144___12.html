<h1>The Last Missouri-Kansas&nbsp;Game</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br> <br>
<br>

<p>While Kansas celebrated a huge win, Dixon and the Tigers were down and out. 
(AP)</p> 
<p>LAWRENCE, Kan. &mdash; Nobody seemed willing to admit that this was the 
last game. No, people kept saying, Missouri and Kansas will probably play each 
other in the Big 12 tournament, and that&rsquo;s in just a couple weeks. Hey, 
they said, Kansas and Missouri could meet in the NCAA tournament. Don&rsquo;t 
worry, they said, in the years ahead Missouri and Kansas will probably renew 
the rivalry in some sort of annual game played in Kansas City.</p> 
<p>And nobody seemed willing to admit &mdash; or accept &mdash; that this was 
it. The last time. The Big 12 tournament? People care about that for roughly 20 
minutes, right until the instant that the NCAA tournament seedings are 
announced. The NCAA tournament? You&rsquo;re really going to count on that 
mathematical improbability? An annual game? Even if that should happen &mdash; 
and Kansas coach Bill Self is forcefully against it &mdash; a non-conference 
annual game between these teams would be a gimmick with nothing at stake.</p> 
<p>No, it can&rsquo;t ever be the same. This was the end, the last time Kansas 
and Missouri will play each other in the rivalry game that has fueled winters 
in the Midwest for more than 100 years.</p>

<p>How much would parents pay to send their son to play four years of 
basketball for Krzyzewski? (AP)</p> 
<p>My great good friend Michael Rosenberg has a wonderful knack of writing 
things that strike powerful disagreement inside me. It is one of his many 
gifts. This is not to say that I always, or even often, disagree with Michael. 
I don&rsquo;t. I think Michael&rsquo;s one of the best sportswriters in the 
country and we see things the same way the vast majority of the time. Maybe 
that&rsquo;s why when I DO disagree with him &mdash; likeI did with a Tiger 
Woods column he wrote last year or the let&rsquo;s pay the stars of college 
sports piece he wrote this week &mdash; it&rsquo;s a pretty strong emotion, the 
sort of emotion that pushes me to mumble to myself and to start a new file on 
my computer.</p> 
<p>There is something I have wanted to say for a while about big-time college 
athletics, but it is one of those weird thoughts that is both blindingly 
obvious and strangely difficult to put into words. That&rsquo;s why I had never 
written it before. It was reading Michael&rsquo;s piece, and this sentence in 
particular &mdash; &ldquo;If we wanted to be completely<em>fair</em>, then 
football and basketball players would not be forced to subsidize non-revenue 
athletes&rdquo; &mdash; that opened the door. It has been a long time since I 
read a sentence I more strongly disagreed with.</p> 
<p>And that led to the words that form the heart of this piece, words that, I 
have to say, surprised me: &ldquo;College athletics are NOT about the 
players.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You are more than welcome to stop reading now.</p>

<h1>Lorenzo Charles and the&nbsp;Shot</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<p>Charles' last-second dunk gave N.C. State an improbable win over Houston 
for the 1983 national title. (Rich Clarkson)</p> 
<p>First an apology: This will be more about me than it will be about Lorenzo 
Charles. These are the feelings coursing through me. Lorenzo Charles died on 
Monday, a shocking thing. He was driving a bus for Elite Tours and the crash 
happened on Interstate 40, near Raleigh, N.C., where he was beloved. Charles 
had lived a basketball life &mdash; he was an excellent college basketball 
player, of course. Then he played in basketball leagues all around the world, 
and he coached for a while before settling back in Raleigh and driving busses. 
He also made a famous shot. Buck O&rsquo;Neil, who lived to be almost 95, 
always said that we should save our tears for those who die young. Charles was 
just 47 years old.</p> 
<p>I met him only once. But I thought about him often. It had something to do 
with growing up. And that&rsquo;s what I think about now.</p>

<br> <br>

<p>Walker's Huskies finished ninth in the Big East -- now they're the favorite 
to win the NCAA championship. (US Presswire)</p> 
<p>HOUSTON &mdash; Basketball is probably the most predictable of all our team 
sports. Well, it only makes sense. Everything is on a smaller scale in 
basketball. The court is smaller. There are fewer players on each team. There 
are fewer players on each roster. There are fewer angles, fewer moves, fewer 
countermoves. One great basketball player can make a larger impact, I suspect, 
than one great player in any other team sport.</p>

<h1>The Miracle of&nbsp;Butler</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br>

<br> <br>

<p>HOUSTON &mdash; The wildest story in the history of college basketball 
might just come down to something simple. Like a simple fact printed at the 
bottom of the score sheet: VCU scored zero fast break points Saturday night. 
Zero. For 40 minutes in an insanely large dome in Houston, the VCU players 
wanted nothing more than to run. All the Rams players wanted was open space. 
Every time they got the ball, they pushed it up court &mdash; faster, always 
faster &mdash; this is how VCU plays, this is how their dynamic coach Shaka 
Smart coaches, this is how VCU won five games and made one of the more unlikely 
Final Four runs ever. Butler did not allow a single fast-break point Saturday 
night. For 40 minutes, the Bulldogs players got back on defense &hellip; and 
got back on defense &hellip; and got back on defense. All night long, VCU could 
not beat them down the court. Not even once. And Butler won the game 70-62. And 
Butler is going back to the national championship game.</p>

<h1>Terrible&nbsp;Timeouts</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> 
<p>I love just about everything about the first week of March Madness. I love 
the wall-to-wall games. I love the upsets. I love the blowouts. I love the 
great individual performances. I love the close final minutes. I love the 
enthusiasm of the players, the fans, Kevin Harlan. The regular college 
basketball season doesn&rsquo;t do much for me, but March makes it all 
worthwhile.</p> 
<p>Except for one thing &hellip; I am SO sick of the studio hosts talking 
again and again and again about the officiating.</p>

<p>The worst ending in the history of sports happened on Jan. 4, 1981, on a 
frigid day in Cleveland. This is an indisputable fact. The Browns trailed the 
Oakland Raiders 14-12 with less than a minute remaining in their AFC divisional 
playoff game. Cleveland had the ball at the Oakland 13. See that number? 
Thirteen? Don&rsquo;t tell me that the &ldquo;13 is bad luck&rdquo; concept is 
just a myth. Apollo 13. Friday the 13th. Ralph Branca wore 13. And the Browns 
had the ball on the Oakland 13.</p> 
<p>I was 13 years old.</p> 
<p>The wind-chill that day was minus-36, and Cleveland&rsquo;s kicker, Don 
Cockroft &mdash; who only that year had become the 10th player in NFL history 
to score 1,000 points in the NFL &mdash; had already missed two field goals and 
two extra points. Well, one of the extra points was blocked and the other was 
botched on the snap, but the point was that this was no day for kicking a 
football through uprights. This was a contributing reason why Browns coach Sam 
Rutigliano decided on a pass play called &ldquo;Red Right 88.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Dean</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Dean Smith was a genius on the bench, managing every game with the same 
attention to detail. (Heinz Kluetmeier/SI)</p> 
<p>Good days. Some years ago, I went to a North Carolina basketball game with 
a buddy who despised Dean Smith. Well, that&rsquo;s not exactly right &mdash; 
he had nothing against the man. He despised the IDEA of Dean Smith. He honestly 
believed that Smith wasn&rsquo;t really a great coach. He thought that 
Smith&rsquo;s remarkable coaching record was the result of exceptional 
recruiting and his willingness to choke the life out of games. Also a bit of 
luck. He didn&rsquo;t see North Carolina&rsquo;s famous Four Corners offense as 
an innovation as much as a cowardly manipulation of the rules. He liked to make 
the point that both of North Carolina&rsquo;s national championships under Dean 
Smith were haunted by spectacular last-second gaffes by an opponent.</p> 
<p>North Carolina was playing at Georgia Tech that day &mdash; this was 
another one of coach Bobby Cremins&rsquo; preposterously talented Georgia Tech 
teams. And my friend went to cheer for Georgia Tech and against Carolina. When 
I was in high school in North Carolina, they used to call these sorts of fans 
ABC fans &mdash; Anyone But Carolina. Maybe they still do.</p>

<h1>Wooden and&nbsp;Love</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Most people can live with the vague. For instance: What is success? Well, 
um, you know, um, there&rsquo;s that old line about art: I know it when I see 
it. I know it when I feel it. Success is like that, right? I can&rsquo;t quite 
put it into words what success means, and other things like 
&ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; or &ldquo;class,&rdquo; or &ldquo;integrity,&rdquo; 
but I don&rsquo;t need the words, right? These are things that come from 
wordless places deep inside, things that cannot be defined, things that we 
believe transcend definition. That&rsquo;s OK. We KNOW what success means, even 
if we can&rsquo;t really SAY what it means. Most of us can live comfortably in 
that hazy world.</p>

<h1>A Ticket&nbsp;Scandal</h1> College Basketball |  Comments <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> 
<p>Jamie Squire/Getty Images</p> 
<p>You have probably heard about the crazy ticket mayhem that has been going 
on at the University of Kansas. In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, well, it seems 
like the last few years there was this itsy-bitsy little mixup there where at 
least 17,609 premium basketball tickets and 2,181 premium football tickets were 
stolen from big time Kansas buyers and then sold or used by Kansas ticket 
office employees. Right now, the estimate and charge is that about $1 million 
was siphoned away from the school and into the pockets of those employees. But 
Jack Focht, who led the internal investigation, concedes that he would not be 
surprised if the real amount was closer to $3 million. Whoops. Bit of an 
oversight there.</p>
