<h1>Plyometrics better than Conventional Strength Training?</h1> July 1, 2010

<p>Here is some research (which I would normally post on the Facebook Fan Page
), but since it is from my old McGill backyard at the University of Montreal 
(otherwise known as U of M) , I feel I should give them some exposure.</p> 
<p>While our sprinters do BOTH plyometrics and conventional weight training 
(mix of Olympic lifts, Power lifts &ndash; bench andsquats, and regular 
strength training for ancillary exercises), distance runners could certainly 
improve on the strength in their legs as well as flexibility (in my opinion).
</p> 
<p>The argument presented is plyometrics helps with bounding and bounding 
lifts you off the ground more efficiently, thus reducing the energy cost of 
running for distance runners.&nbsp; This results in faster times, at least in 
theory.</p> 
<p> <br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>VS </strong>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Control data: 3 control groups (no plyos nor weight training, plyometrics 
and conventional weight training), 35 subjects, 3000m time trials, running 
economy tests before and after an 8 week training period.</p> 
<p>Armchair coaches: I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of you would like to see a 4th group 
with BOTH plyometrics and conventional weight training!</p> 
<p>Results: improvements of 3%, 4.8% and 4.1% for the none, plyometrics and 
conventional weight training.</p> 
<p>The bottom line is ANY improvement in strength and elasticity of your leg 
muscles will result in faster running.&nbsp; Of course, that extra strength and 
possible muscle mass must be translated to applying force to the ground while 
in a running motion.</p> 
<p>I can see the resistance (no pun intended) in a distance runner doing free 
weights in the weight room, but keeping plyometrics fun while doing low hurdle 
hops and stadium stairs can be more beneficial!</p> 
<p>So preliminary results suggest Plyometrics are better than Conventional 
Strength Training?&nbsp; Some questions to ponder:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>is it more running specific?&nbsp; </li> 
<li>is it the higher intensity?&nbsp; </li> 
<li>is it from higher CNS stimulus?</li> 
<li>is <strong>asymmetrical training</strong> better (in the weight room, 
machines can have a fixed range of motion, thus free weights are preferred)</li>
</ol> 
<p> <br>

<p>it doesnt state what weight training exercises were used, and what plyos 
were used.Squats, bench and olympic lifts have a time and place in a programme, 
and any world class coach will periodise weight training to peak at the right 
time, therefore 8 weeks is too short time frame. Single legsquats, single leg 
deadlifts, quartersquats e.t.c are more specific to the sprinting motion than 
squats and bench. The article also doesnt state reps, sets and recoveries 
between reps and sessions. For all i know it could have been hypertrophy, max 
strength, power and/or power endurance.</p> 
<p>In my coaching here in england, we do just as much weight training sessions 
as we do plyos, both of which are post track workout (speed). I am open to 
suggestions particularly when it comes to strength training so feel free to 
challenge me on my philosophies.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the two landmark studies on plyometric effects on 
Distance Running you need to access EXPLOSIVE STRENGTH TRAINING IMPROVES 5-K 
RUNNING TIME by Improving Running Economy and Muscle Power; European Journal of 
Applied Physiology, Vol. 86,#5 pp. 1527-1533, 1999. This study used actual 
competitive distance runners in Finland.</p> 
<p>Following up on this study, Rob Spurrs used Australian Distance Runners for 
his study THE EFFECTS OF PLYOMETRIC TRAINING ON DISTANCE RUNNING PERFORMANCE; 
European Journal of Applied Physiology, Vol 89, #1 pp.1-7, 2003.</p> 
<p>The original study looked at performances over 5k while the subsequent 
study looked at 3k performance.</p> 
<p>The first study showed dramatic improvements in running economy (8%), max 
velocity (4%) and 5k race performance (30 second improvements in the plyo 
group,no change in control group).</p> 
<p>The second study showed an average 3k improvement by 16.6 seconds(2.7%)in 
plyo group while control group had no change in times. Plyo group also made 
significant improvements in running economy at 3 different speeds (12k/hour 
6.7%, 14k/hr 6.4%, and 4.1% at 16k/hour) with no change in control group at 
these speeds.</p> 
<p>As for wondering what Max Strength Training would add to the plyo work for 
distance runners you need to check out MAXIMAL STRENGTH TRAINING IMPROVES 
AEROBIC ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE; Scandinavian Journal of Med &amp; Science in 
Sports, Vol. 12, pp. 288-295, 2002 AND MAXIMAL STRENGTH TRAINING IMPROVES WORK 
ECONOMY IN TRAINED FEMALE CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS, Med &amp; Science in Sports 
&amp; Exercise, Vol. 31, #6, pp. 870-877, 1999.</p> 
<p>You may also want to read STRENGTH AND POWER for Maximum Speed as it 
details all the background information on WHY max strength, elastic strength 
and explosive strength improve speed at ALL velocities and gives detailed 
explanations of the exercises found to be best for getting this training effect.

<p>I do feel a mix on the percentage level, from Base Season through the end 
of the Competitive Season. Is the better way to go. Progressing an young or 
older athlete, from the ground up, to that finely tuned and Sprinting Machine,

<p>I agree calvin, but how long should each cycle last? 4 weeks, 8 
weeks&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; and should the mix of each training demand be 
equal e.g &ndash; 1 week hypertrophy, 1 week max strength, 1 week power. Or 
should we spending more time on a particular demand given a particular time of 
the seasoin?</p>
