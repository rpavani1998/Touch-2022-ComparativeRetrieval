<p>There has been much debate on this blog and others about why Kentucky 
doesn't draw in the great recruits, great coaches, and produce football teams 
that are competitive with the other schools in the SEC.&nbsp; Many of us have 
lamented Kentucky's apparent lack of support for the football program, and 
pointed the finger mostly at the athletics department.</p> 
<p>Matt Jones at KSR highlighted an important piece at the Herald-Leader, 
where a UK trustee explains in detail most of the reasons UK doesn't spend the 
cash to upgrade the facilities to SEC level.&nbsp; It is a revealing, almost 
expos&eacute;-like look into many of the ins and outs of who gets money and 
why.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the football program has a lot of competition 
for the dollars it needs to upgrade facilities.</p> 
<p>Of course, it isn't the whole story, but the reality is that Kentucky 
cannot fund major projects like a stadium renovation entirely out of private 
funds.&nbsp; They have to have the ability to borrow money, and that province 
is reserved to a board of trustees that is very reluctant to dole out the 
ability to borrow cash to athletics.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I encourage each and every one of you who have wondered about what 
structural problems hold back UK from creating the kinds of programs we see 
everywhere around the SEC to read Matt's post and the Herald-Leader 
article.&nbsp; But before you wax all polemic, consider that there are many 
good causes requiring money that UK can borrow, and sports is understandably 
not at the very top of the list.&nbsp; Kentucky is supposed to be an academic 
institution first, and it looks to me like they are putting their money where 
their mission is.</p> 
<p>The flip side to that is that the potential cash cow that is the athletics 
department, and in particular, the football program, is getting starved for 
money.&nbsp; The basketball program is the sacred cow at Kentucky, and it will 
get what it needs one way or the other.&nbsp; But football is not, and the 
reason is that the UK Athletics Administration cannot borrow money independent 
of the university.</p> 
<p>As Matt said, this is a matter that deserves public discussion about where 
the flagship university of the Commonwealth should put its priorities.&nbsp; 
That answer might not necessarily mean more money to athletics.</p> 
<p>This ought to provide good fodder for discussion.</p>

<h5> Good teams </h5> 
<p>bring good students. I only had a few schools that taught my subject. 
Kentucky was one of about fifteen of them. I chose Kentucky because I followed 
the basketball program. I was living in Arizona at the time. Arizona had no 
school that tought my subject so I was going to have to move anyway,</p>

<h5> Interesting dilemma, ... </h5> 
<p>The fact that you were an out-of-state student means you were a profit 
center for the University. However, attracting more in-state students actually 
expands the tuition/cost deficit that state funding has to fill and more 
students in general further increases the demand pressure on the 
Commonwealth&rsquo;s limited bonding capacity to expand dorms, classrooms, etc. 
&ndash; accentuating the funding problem for UK Athletics.</p> 
<p> by TeamWeaver on  Nov 7, 2011 5:57 AM EST up reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> Alright, I'll throw in my two cents ... </h5> 
<p>Imo, the place to start is with this number&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> &ldquo;In the decade of this AD&rsquo;s tenure, the trustees 
received $820 million in bonding debt authority.&rdquo;</blockquote> 
<p>That $820 million number is set by the state legislature. Why is it so low? 
Reality suggests the University&rsquo;s bonding needs are limited by the 
competing requirements of the various political constituencies under the 
Commonwealth&rsquo;s umbrella debt service capacity. Interest rates are low but 
so are state revenues. Assuming the $820 million figure reasonably reflects the 
University&rsquo;s fair claim on the State&rsquo;s bonding capacity, something 
I&rsquo;m not willing to concede, anecdotal evidence suggests any bonding 
proposals by the University for UK athletics are not being warmly received in 
Frankfort. On the other hand, bonding capacity can be found for the new 
University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital. In addition to the 
political climate in Frankfort, this tradeoff reflects the priorities of the 
Board of Trustees and their willingness to champion the University&rsquo;s 
funding proposals. On the one hand a new hospital, on the other a new football 
stadium. At first glance, even for the rabid fans of the BBN, the choice seems 
reasonably straight forward.</p> 
<p>But, imo, that would be a short sighted perspective. If it was just a 
matter of health care needs always trumping college sports entertainment, how 
could Arkansas be so morally corrupt as to spend $300 million to expand their 
athletic facilities? The University of Kentucky is a service center of the 
Commonwealth and in real terms that mean&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Cost Center.&rsquo; 
But, tucked away in that huge cost center that is UK, you find that UK 
Athletics is a &lsquo;Profit Center,&rsquo; not only paying its own way but 
actually throwing off $20 million in diverted revenue to the University.</p> 
<p>Further, anecdotal estimates suggest that a new Football stadium could 
expect to<strong>double</strong> the revenue currently earned by Commonwealth 
Stadium. Similar estimates, but even more lucrative, suggest a new basketball 
arena modeled on the NBA archetype could be expected to<strong>quadruple
</strong> the revenue of Rupp. <em>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve looked and I 
can&rsquo;t find a good figure for the actual revenue directly attributable to 
Commonwealth Stadium or Rupp Arena but I&rsquo;m willing to bet doubling and 
quadrupling it is a big number with a similar impact on the amount contributed 
by UK Athletics to the University.</em> That would suggest it is in the 
University&rsquo;s best interest to invest in developing the necessary 
facilities for UK Athletics independent of what such an investment might mean 
for the competitive success of the football and basketball teams.</p> 
<p>However, such an investment on the part of the UK would be costly. As you 
can well believe, there are no budget surpluses at UK and the administration 
has already built the funds coming from UK Athletics into their long-term 
budget projections, probably into perpetuity. Any bonds sold to finance the 
construction of new facilities would have to be amortized over the term of the 
bonds &ndash; interest and principal. Even though the new facilities would be 
expected to support the cost of their own bond service once built, the initial 
cost of bonds during the 2 &ndash; 3 years of construction and any startup 
phase would have to be paid by the University. At current tax free bond yields, 
the $20 million currently diverted to the University could be expected to 
support approximately $570 million in 30-year bonds. While such a sum would be 
enough to build a new basketball arena or renovate Commonwealth, it probably 
couldn&rsquo;t do both and certainly couldn&rsquo;t cover the full cost of 
building a new football stadium. More money and bonding capacity would have to 
be found.</p> 
<p>Having discussed the big ticket items above, a large number of the projects 
Kentucky Athletics would like to build would be much smaller and, although 
geared toward improving recruiting or the competitive success of our various 
teams, they wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to materially bring more money into UK 
Athletics. So, even if bonds could be used to finance these smaller projects, 
payments of interest and principal would cut directly into the funds available 
to distribute to the University. It would be the University or non-revenue 
sports that would shoulder the cuts to finance any new construction. Some would 
think that a reasonable burden for them to bear and I would be one of those, 
but other constituencies would disagree.</p>

<h5> This is a great comment ... </h5> 
<p>&hellip; and a very lucid argument. I am inclined to agree with everything 
in here.</p> 
<p>I will point out, though, that &ldquo;If we build it, they will come&rdquo; 
is probably wishful thinking when it comes to football. For basketball, it 
would yield money immediately after a new arena was put into service. Football 
would take at least five years to take hold after construction, just because 
watching a relatively uncompetitive team, even from new seats, won&rsquo;t 
materially increase revenue.</p> 
<p>Plus, building a team in the SEC to the level that would fully leverage a 
new or substantially upgraded stadium is a dicey proposition at best &ndash; 
the competition is not going to just sit back and say, &ldquo;Look, 
Kentucky&rsquo;s trying to compete in football, too. How sweet.&rdquo; They are 
decades ahead and making up that ground in any significant degree is probably 
too costly to consider.</p> 
<p>In sum, It is a much longer-term ROI on football compared to basketball, 
even though the numbers are much bigger in the end. It may be that is the main 
factor holding football back. If basketball wants a new arena, they will 
eventually get one, and we both know this. Football would require a much more 
serious and ultimately uncertain effort.</p>

<h5> It just doesn't seem fitting </h5> 
<p>for football to make more moolah than basketball and get a lot less 
payback. The Rupp situation will be fixed, the Commonwealth situation will not. 
Lexington, the city, will make it happen. A combination arena/stadium might be 
the only way to get football facilities upgraded.<br>
 Mitch tries hard, I am 
positive, He really is a football guy. I am sure he has begged and begged for 
more leash to spend more on football. The new boards and sound upgrades at 
least something. He is trying.<br>
 I also think a lot of people might owe him 
an apology.</p>

<h5> Hmmm... </h5> 
<p>I knew that Athletics Dept gave money back to UK, but what I didn&rsquo;t 
know was that we are the<strong>only</strong> SEC team to do so&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> but only at UK is athletics required to help fund the university 
at its own peril</blockquote> 
<p>The question in my mind is, how did we get here?? Why are we the only SEC 
organization to do this, and again referencing the article, why do we not get 
funded out of the general fund??</p> 
<p>And this article sounds ominous&hellip; Hat tip to TeamWeaver is this post. 
Will this make it harder for the Athletics Dept to do anything??</p>

<h5> Reiterate And Expound </h5> 
<p>Earlier response to GAE:</p> 
<p><em>Appreciate link, good read, new perspective. Confirmation of what 
should have been obvious: UK made its choice in middle of last century and will 
have to live with the consequences. I do expect that sports economics (read: 
football becoming the overriding factor in reorganization) will eventually 
force the University to rethink its priorities.</em></p> 
<p>I fully expect the idea of &ldquo;super conferences&rdquo; to evolve into 
an actuality &mdash; most likely when the economy has returned to something 
near normal &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an impossibility that UK 
would be left out of such groups if it doesn&rsquo;t have a similar evolution 
of its football program to match the standards of funding, facilities, etc. 
Thus they would join other basketball-first schools such as Duke, Indiana, 
Kansas, Memphis, Vanderbilt, Villanova, perhaps even UConn and Syracuse, and 
those that do not field FB teams: Georgetown, St. John&rsquo;s, et al.</p>

<h5> I am not sure </h5> 
<p>that UK would be left out. A conference full of great teams cannibalizes 
itself in football. Now if a playoff system were instituted then we might have 
to upgrade or be replaced but even then I am not sure.</p>

<h5> What if the following were to occur </h5> 
<p>As WW points out addressing mega super-confernces. What if Alabama, LSU, 
Auburn, TAAM, Florida, Georgia, Arkansas and Tennesee (?) were to decide that 
their fortunes lied elsewhere under a different structure, forming a 
Super-Conference. Maybe this would include inviting a Texas, Oklahoma, Florida 
State and Notre Dame, with another two additional schools at a later date. They 
could just walk away from the SEC couldn&rsquo;t they &ndash; what&rsquo;s to 
stop them &ndash; loyalty, that&rsquo;s a joke when it comes to greed and 
power. IMO this could happen and the SEC be left with the remaining schools who 
are the perennial cellar dwellers. What kind of TV contract would that demand 
for these schools &ndash; nothing. We (these schools) would be begging almost 
any conference for admittance.</p>

<h5> Help me out here. </h5> 
<p>Regardless of the method of funding projects can&rsquo;t we just simplify 
it to economic justification and ROI? I totally agree with Glenn in that we 
cannot simply build a new stadium with the &ldquo;build it and they will 
come&rdquo; rationale. If we&rsquo;re not filling the current stadium, 
don&rsquo;t even think about building a new one &ndash; it makes no economic 
sense.</p> 
<p>We need to maximize our current situation first &ndash; we have to fill the 
stadium for games by raising the level of play and giving the fans a reason to 
go to the game and back the program with dollars. That elevated level of play 
and increased interest in the football program has a tremendous impact on the 
economics. More butts in the seats means increases gate revenue, parking 
revenue, concessions, jerseys, donations to athletics and donations to the 
general fund.</p> 
<p>Just taking this years attendance figures we&rsquo;ve left about 60000 
seats empty for the six games held at Commonwealth and we still have another 
home game on the schedule. That number is based on the released attendance 
figures which tend to be inflated. At an average ticket price of, say, $40 that 
comes to $2.4 million dollars. Add in concessions, parking and souvenirs and 
you easily get to $3 million dollars.</p> 
<p>I would simply like to see more spent on football recruiting and football 
player facilities; not necessarily to be equal with the top SEC programs like 
Florida and Alabama but several levels above our current state. Simplistically, 
if you had $3 million dollars extra a year you could afford $30 million dollars 
of expense and have 10% return on your investment and these days 10% looks 
pretty damn good. That is a sizable chunk of change which seems to be an 
excellent investment in the future.</p> 
<p>Granted, if you spend the money you&rsquo;re not guaranteeing the program 
will &ldquo;Rise&rdquo;; however, if you don&rsquo;t the opposite is just as 
likely. This is simple economics, you have to spend money to make money and 
this is a very basic look. On one hand it assumes filling the stadium for each 
game on the rosy assumption but it also doesn&rsquo;t take into account higher 
seat prices justified with a better product, increases in the Blue White fund 
requirements, increases in alumni donations to the school and all of the 
incremental boost in revenue that comes with a successful program and the 
positive national press that derives from success.</p> 
<p>Can we not just make sure the trustees holding the purse strings take some 
economic and investment style decisions? After all, the bottom line is raising 
more money for everything &ndash; football, basketball, field hockey, the 
University, the Albert B. Chandler and the like.</p>

<h5> Assumed ROI </h5> 
<p>You are still asking an organization that historically thinks of football 
as an afterthought to throw dollars after an assumed ROI. You assume that 
putting more money into recruiting and more money into facilities that are not 
a stadium will improve the level of play enough to fill Commonwealth Stadium 
game after game. And I think you would have to assume that at current ticket 
prices, as I don&rsquo;t know that improved play could justify higher prices 
among the current fanbase. I don&rsquo;t think that the organization will take 
that bet. If they are going to sink more money into athletics, it&rsquo;s going 
to be into basketball, where there is a virtual guaranteed ROI.</p> 
<p>The other question is, what if they DO spend this money? UK football would 
still be an afterthought in the national media. I think about the difference 
between UK basketball and the rest of the SEC. No matter how good Florida or SC 
or UT or really any of the other schools might be, the focus is always on UK. 
Even when we have a bad year (for us anyway), the national focus is &ldquo;what 
has happened to Kentucky?&rdquo; Not, look at how great Florida is. And no 
matter what the team did last year, Rupp is filled to the brim. Rupp is filled 
for exhibition games! Alabama and Florida and Tennessee football fans are like 
that &mdash; they will fill their stadiums regardless (especially since they 
probably know that if the team does REALLY badly, they&rsquo;ll get a new 
coach). Those schools will throw money at their football programs because the 
fans make it a priority, and because, like UK basketball, it&rsquo;s a virtual 
guaranteed money-maker. UK football on the other hand can&rsquo;t have a down 
year, or the fans go away again. Sad, but true.</p> 
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t see the economics working to convince the trustees to 
put more money into football. They&rsquo;ll increase the money as needed to 
keep us &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; in the SEC. I think respectable to them will 
mean an occasional lower tier bowl appearance and a .500 record, with a couple 
of SEC wins. But I honestly think expecting or asking for more than that is a 
losing proposition.</p> 
<p>You can put it on the board....YES.</p>

<h5> The phrase : Return On Investment....... </h5>

<p>To obtain a ROI, someone must be first interested in making the investment. 
So far, no one seems to be willing to look farther than next week<em>down the 
road</em><strong></strong>. Metaphorically speaking, of course&hellip;..;-)</p>
