<h1>FANTASY SPORTS GAMES</h1> 
<p>Fantazzle offers the best fantasy sports games online for fantasy football, 
fantasy baseball, fantasy racing, fantasy golf, fantasy hockey, and fantasy 
basketball! Our fantasy games test your skills and reward cash prizes to the 
winners. Unlike most fantasy sports games where games are season long, most of 
Fantazzle's games are played for short durations. Our games are played daily 
and weekly, depending upon the sport.</p> 
<p>As soon as a game ends, cash prizes are awarded immediately. There is no 
game to game commitment, and you can play whenever you want to. There are also 
no live drafts. Choose your entry fee, league size, and any player, and 
Fantazzle will do the rest. Leagues are randomly generated and announced as 
soon as the game starts. All of our games offer live scoring for you enjoyment!
</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Fantazzle currently offers fantasy games for football, baseball, basketball,
racing, golf, and hockey. We also offer special promotion games like the Ray 
Rice Football Game.</p> <br>

<h2>Fantasy Sports Challenge Games</h2> 
<p>Challenge Games are simple to play. You select players according to the 
game's roster requirements. Requirements are created from positions (example - 
quarterback, shortstop, racers, etc) and are unique for each sport. This is the 
only rule for Challenge Games, simple and easy! You never have to worry about 
your player being taken since you can choose any player you want. Ties are 
possible, but rare.</p> <br>

<h2>Fantasy Sports Salary Cap Games</h2> 
<p>Salary Cap Games are similar to Challenge Games, but with one added 
dimension. Like Challenge Games, you must select a fantasy roster based on 
position requirements, but in Salary Cap Games, you must also stay under the 
fantasy salary cap. Each player costs $X and you cannot spend more than 
$1,000,000 to fill out your roster. The bigger fantasy studs cost more, so you 
have to be wise when selecting a team.</p> <br>

<h2>Fantasy Sports Pick'em Games</h2> 
<p>Pick'em Games are a unique way to play fantasy. In Pick'em Games, you pick 
a fantasy player who will score the most fantasy points for each game matchup. 
The outcome of the pro game does not matter. What matters is choosing the 
better fantasy player for each game. Your fantasy team will consist of one 
player from each professional game. For football, you choose a quarterback for 
each game.</p> <br>

<h2>Fantasy Sport Bracket Games</h2> 
<p>  Fantasy Sports Bracket Games are one of the best known contest formats in 
the US thanks to the NCAA Men's basketball March Madness tournament. In 
addition, Fantazzle Fantasy Games will find interesting games for our players 
to play fantasy sports in the future. Creating afantasy football bracket game
