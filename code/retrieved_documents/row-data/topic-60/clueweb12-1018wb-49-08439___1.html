<b>Alabama Men&rsquo;s Basketball 
Coach Anthony Grant had added three guards in Grant&rsquo;s first full year to 
recruit for the Crimson Tide. On Friday evening, word came that Bama would also 
add a big man for the 2010-11 season.</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jason Carter, a 
6-8, 230-pound forward, told &rsquo;BAMA Magazine and BamaMag.com that he would 
sign withAlabama. <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;I just committed about five minutes 
ago,&rdquo; Carter said. &ldquo;I called Coach Grant.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Carter, 
a native of New Orleans whose family was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, is 
living in Humble, Texas, and played for Christian Life Center Academy.<br>
<br>

 Here are some of Carter&rsquo;s comments Friday:<br>
<br>
<b>Why did you 
commit today?</b> <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;My parents and I got together and talked 
about everything. Alabama is where my heart is and that is where I wanted to 
be. I just decided to commit because I wanted to be no where else but at 
Alabama.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>What on-and-off-the-court factors influenced your 
decision?</b> <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;I felt like I adapted to the environment. I 
liked the players. We got along well. I felt like I could be there and make 
Alabama my new home. I had a good relationship with the coaching staff. Not 
only Coach (Antoine) Pettway and Coach Grant, but I felt I connected with all 
the other coaches when I was in Tuscaloosa. I felt I could do well academically 
too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>How do you feel about finally making a commitment? </b>
<br> <br>
 &ldquo;It feels great. I feel relieved. I feel good.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
<b>What was Coach Grant&rsquo;s reaction? </b> <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;He was 
excited. He said welcome to the family, and he was speechless.&rdquo;<br>
<br>

<b>What were your initial comments to Coach Grant? </b><br>
<br>
 &ldquo;I came 
right out and told him I wanted to be a part of the Crimson Tide basketball 
team.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>What would you like to say to the Alabama faithful? 
</b> <br>
<br>
 &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to be on the campus.&rdquo; <br>
<br>

<b>Christian Life Center Academy Head Coach Carlos Wilson comments about Jason 
Carter committing to The University of Alabama:</b> <br>
<br>
 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very proud and excited that Jason has chosen Alabama. That 
is what guys come to Christian Life Center Academy for is to take the next step 
to go to the next level to play for a school in a good conference and get a 
great degree.<br>
<br>
 &quot;At Alabama, he can achieve all that if he works 
hard. We are excited. We don&rsquo;t think there could have been a better 
choice than Alabama. We&rsquo;re all excited on our end about Jason going to 
Alabama.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>What factors played a role in the decision? </b><br>
<br> &ldquo;He just told me in our conversations that he said Coach Grant told 
him the truth and not what he needed to hear. Not saying anybody else told him 
differently, but a lot of time when people are recruiting you they tell you 
everything&rsquo;s going to be peaches and cream, we are going to be great, 
we&rsquo;re going to smile and we&rsquo;re going to have a fun time.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;Well Coach Grant actually told him the truth &ndash; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s 
going to be tough, I&rsquo;m going to be tough. You&rsquo;re going to be 
accountable. We want our kids to act a certain way. We want high character 
guys. We are going to work hard.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
 &quot;A lot of things kids 
don&rsquo;t want to hear. He said when Coach Grant told him that he kind of 
reminded him of myself, just telling the truth. He likes that, and he knows 
that he needs that along with he really enjoyed playing with the guys.<br>
<br>

 &quot;He really felt like he fit in well. Socially at Alabama it was a good 
fit. All those factors combined I think and the possibility to play early 
influenced his decision.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Speaking about Coach Grant:</b><br>

<br> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a no nonsense coach. He does have a good personality, 
but he just keeps everything in perspective. He knows there is a time and place 
for everything and he (Jason) was like, &lsquo;Coach, that is similar to 
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Additional comments from Coach Wilson:</b> <br>

<br> &ldquo;Just as a program, every time a kid signs with a college, it really 
makes me proud. It really shows the directions that our program is headed when 
guys get a chance to choose between great schools likeOle Miss and Alabama. 
Hopefully in the future this won&rsquo;t be our last player to go to Alabama. 
We&rsquo;ll just continue with this relationship and build upon it and 
hopefully send some more players to Alabama in the future.&rdquo;<br>
