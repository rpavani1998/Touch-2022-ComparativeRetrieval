<h1>I&rsquo;m Not Sure That 3 Is Better Than 1</h1> 
<p>As you probably know if you have read this blog much I am a diehard 
Michigan fan &ndash; the kind that bleeds maize and blue.Given that 
you&rsquo;ll have a sense of how much I have enjoyed the last year or two of 
football, and the last decade of basketball. I&rsquo;m optimistic now, though 
&ndash; In Rod I trust. The being said, the press conference by coach Rich 
Rodriguez today pretty much terrified me.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been keeping track, Michigan&rsquo;s biggest problem 
right now is quarterback &ndash; i.e. they really don&rsquo;t have one. They 
were spoiled by four good years from Chad Henne, but he&rsquo;s now in his 
second year as backup with the Dolphins, and a void was left in his stead. Uber 
frosh Ryan Mallett was supposed to be the answer as a sophomore last year, but 
he made a knee jerk reaction and left as soon as Rodriguez was hired because he 
didn&rsquo;t think he fit in with the system. Now he&rsquo;s at Arkansas and 
about to be eligible again. Last year we made due with Nick Sheridan and David 
Cone mostly, but it was more than ugly. That was to be expected &ndash; they 
hadn&rsquo;t been recruited by Rodriguez, and they just weren&rsquo;t suited to 
his system.</p> 
<p>This year Sheridan is still around, and he is being challenged by two true 
freshman &ndash; early enrollee Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson. Forcier is 
the brother of former Michigan and Stanford QB Jason, and he&rsquo;s an 
impressive all-round talent &ndash; the likely long term starter from the 
group. Robinson is an athletic freak with a weird habit &ndash; he hasn&rsquo;t 
tied up his cleats since he was seven years old. He just tapes his ankles and 
flops around in his loose shoes. I don&rsquo;t know what the point is, but it 
clearly works for him &ndash; he&rsquo;s a speedster. Sheridan isn&rsquo;t the 
most overwhelming talent, but he has the advantage of experience and age, and 
will be a factor.</p> 
<p>Sounds good, right? There is certainly enough there to win well more than 
the three games we won last year. So why am I terrified. Well, RichRod unveiled 
his QB for the season opener &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t have one. Or rather, he 
has three. Rodriguez intends to give all three players significant playing 
time. That doesn&rsquo;t concern me in that game that much &ndash; it&rsquo;s 
only Western Michigan. What does concern me, though, is that Notre Dame is up 
in week two. I have no respect at all for the Irish, and I want to beat them 
senseless. I won&rsquo;t feel as comfortable in that, though, if we have yet to 
make a QB decision. I don&rsquo;t think you can QB by committee against 
legitimate teams. Scary stuff.</p> 
<p>All that being said, I still think we will win 8 or 9 games this year. And 
I am totally sober as I write this.</p>  Share This Post Tweet <br>
