<h4>Find out why better listeners are better players</h4> <br>

<p>posted by Coach Dawn Writes<br>
 Monday, September 5, 2011 at 2:04pm EDT 
</p> 
<p>My blog is a place for coaches at all levels who are interested in building 
teams, motivating their student athletes, and coaching ideas that work. You 
won't find drills or job postings there, but you will find thoughts from a 
self-proclaimed coaching nerd who wants to help coaches and teams thrive.</p>

<p>source</p> 
<p>We spend sixty percent of our time listening&hellip;yet we only retain 
twenty five percent of what we hear.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is according to Julian 
Treasure in his TEDtalk,5 Ways To Listen Better.&Acirc;&nbsp; Treasure is a 
consultant to businesses that want to learn to listen better, he&rsquo;s 
written a book about listening, and writes a blog devoted to listening called,
Sound Business.&Acirc;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you, I had no idea 
that listening was such a big deal.&Acirc;&nbsp; But if businesses are spending 
money to train their employees to listen, it must be important.</p> 
<p>In his talk, Treasure gives five suggestions for becoming a better 
listener, though I&rsquo;m only going to elaborate on three.&Acirc;&nbsp; As he 
says, &ldquo;listening is our access to understanding&rdquo;, so let&rsquo;s 
figure out how to put our teams into the best possible position to understand 
what we&rsquo;re teaching.</p> 
<p><strong>3 ways to make our players better through more effective listening
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The mixer.</strong>&Acirc;&nbsp; Using my sport (volleyball) as an 
example, noise and sound is built into the game.&Acirc;&nbsp; There are coaches 
shouting things from the sideline, players communicating about who should pass 
the ball, hitters screaming at the setter for the ball, the setter is cheering 
on her hitters, and then there&rsquo;s the group celebration of the 
point.&Acirc;&nbsp; And that happens again and again and again over the course 
of a match.&Acirc;&nbsp; We have to teach our players to actively listen. 
&Acirc;&nbsp;There are so many levels of sound in a gym during a game and our 
teams should be able to filter our sounds from the opponent&rsquo;s sounds and 
from the crowd.&Acirc;&nbsp; I think this is something that&rsquo;s worth 
practicing in our gyms.</p> 
<p><strong>Listening positions.</strong>&Acirc;&nbsp; This one is huge!! 
&Acirc;&nbsp;Listening positions are the vantage point from which we hear 
things.&Acirc;&nbsp; Are we bored? Are we excited? Are we tired? Are we 
annoyed?&Acirc;&nbsp; A person could hear the same information from each of 
those listening positions and respond differently each time.&Acirc;&nbsp; I 
believe one of the toughest things to teach teams is to give each other the 
benefit of the doubt.&Acirc;&nbsp; The teams with bad team chemistry are the 
ones where the players don&rsquo;t believe the best about one 
another.&Acirc;&nbsp; You know what I mean: one player gives another a basic 
correction on the court and the corrected player gets super offended and now 
there&rsquo;s a problem.&Acirc;&nbsp; I ask about the benefit of the doubt in 
our gym a lot, because mood affects things so much.&Acirc;&nbsp; If a player 
woke up late and missed class, received a D on a test, and got in a fight with 
their best friend&hellip;then they&rsquo;re much more likely to get offended 
than a player whose first class got cancelled so they could sleep in, aced 
their test, and went for a cup of coffee with their best friend and had a great 
conversation.</p> 
<p><strong>RASA.</strong>&Acirc;&nbsp; This stands for receive, appreciate, 
summarize, ask.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is the nitty gritty of listening&hellip;and 
something tangible that we can teach our teams.&Acirc;&nbsp; Receive what the 
person is saying (I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve had to tell 
players that I need them to make eye contact with me when I&rsquo;m giving 
instruction), appreciate what they&rsquo;re saying (instead of planning what 
you&rsquo;re going to say in response). This next one reminds me of 
Starbuck&rsquo;s when you order and then the person making the drink repeats 
the same thing&hellip;then there&rsquo;s no confusion.&Acirc;&nbsp; So, 
summarizing seals the listening process because we get to rephrase things in a 
manner that makes sense in our heads.&Acirc;&nbsp; After we summarize, then we 
make sure that we&rsquo;ve got it right by asking the other person.</p> 
<p>I can already hear my team giggling as we go through this and I tell them 
to &ldquo;appreciate&rdquo; what their teammates are saying.&Acirc;&nbsp; That 
being said, if we want our teams to be effective listeners&acirc;&#128;&#148;an 
essential quality in sports&acirc;&#128;&#148;then we&rsquo;ve got to show them 
how to listen so that there is understanding.</p>
