<p>Officials from what&rsquo;s left of the Big East&rsquo;s dwindling football 
membership had another conference call on Tuesday morning and there remains no 
specific timetable on adding UCF, but &ldquo;appears an invitation is 
forthcoming&rdquo; for the Knights, the league&rsquo;s No. 1 target.</p> 
<p>The presidents, chancellors and athletic directors continued to discuss 
potential expansion candidates. Among those mentioned were UCF, Air Force, 
Navy, Temple, Houston, SMU and Boise State, a league source told CBSSports.com.
</p> 
<p>While Commissioner John Marinatto said in a statement Monday the league 
would consider a model with 12 football members, part of Tuesday&rsquo;s call 
was discussing the possibility of splitting the football and basketball 
conference into divisions, once the football side is replenished.</p> 
<p>Navy, Air Force and Boise State are being considered as football members 
only, while UCF, Temple, Houston and SMU are at the top of the list as 
all-sports members so it&rsquo;s unknown right now how large the basketball 
membership could grow.</p> 
<p>The Newark Star-Ledger reported one proposed alignment discussed at 
Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting consisted of Rutgers, UConn, South Florida, UCF, Temple 
and Navy in an East Division with West Virginia, Louisville, Cincinnati, Air 
Force, SMU and Houston in a West Division.</p> 
<p>However, there remains the very real possibility Louisville and West 
Virginia may not be in the league and bound for the Big 12 if Missouri leaves 
for the SEC or the Big 12 expands to 12 teams.</p> 
<p>What make Temple, SMU and Houston attractive to the Big East, one source 
said, is their respective television markets. Philadelphia (Temple) is the 
nation&rsquo;s No. 4 market, Dallas (SMU) is No. 5 and Houston is No. 10.</p> 
<p>Beyond Navy, Air Force and UCF, a league source said &ldquo;no one team is 
definitely next&rdquo; as an expansion candidate.</p> 
<p>There also appears to be conflicting opinions on pursuing Boise State. Some 
league members support adding Boise State because of the Broncos&rsquo; recent 
success, which would help the league with its future BCS status. However, 
others believe Boise State, located nearly 700 miles west of Air Force and 
nearly 2,200 miles from Tampa/USF, is simply too far to consider.</p> 
<p>Boise State president Bob Kustra said in a statement Monday that the 
Broncos &ldquo;are looking forward to their inaugural season&rdquo; in the 
Mountain West Conference and he &ldquo;has great confidence in the future 
direction of the Mountain West.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with 
other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus 
is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped 
make Boise State a popular and compelling national brand,&quot; Kustra said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we 
are continuing to monitor the situation.&nbsp;We are confident that Boise State 
will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status 
with the best interests of the entire university in mind.&nbsp;Boise 
State&rsquo;s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, 
popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely 
valuable conference partner.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A league source also told CBSSports.com that Army is no longer being 
considered as a candidate by the Big East. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been honest 
with us and that they&rsquo;re not interested because of the challenges they 
had previously in Conference USA,&rdquo; the source said.</p> 
<p>Army was in C-USA from 1998-2004. The Cadets were 9-41 in C-USA play and 
finished last in the league five of the seven seasons.</p>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2> 
<p>SecRocks1, I understood ya. Im a Ecu Grad and love playing the ACC teams 
(even though we almost always lose), just was saying that we havent had the 
best of luck against them. As for the conf, yea it would never fly with all the 
TV markets everyone needs to reach and kids from outside the areas wouldn't 
want to come play in such a small conf. I can see how it would bring down the 
other schools as well... just wishful thinking from a fan that travels to alot 
of games. I could make every game if that were the conf.<br>
<br>
ECU won't get 
into the ACC, again&nbsp;I wish it would happen but the ACC already has the NC 
market.<br>
<br>
As for the Conf USA teams they so get out why they can and 
bring back some old members (Cinny and Louy) and creat a new conf much like the 
preposed (GCC haha) in earlier post.&nbsp; Should call it the&nbsp;(BIG CONF 
USA EAST&nbsp;30) since no conf seems to have the right numbers at the end of 
the conf names</p> <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2> 
<p>Burton,</p> 
<p>I never said Pitt was a great program. Yes I've been a Pitt fan my entire 
life. I realize Pitt is a second tier school. Our academics are average at 
best. Our TV market is on the small side. And, our history in both football and 
basketball is spotty at best. I'm not saying Pitt is an elite program by any 
means. But Pitt had no choice but to leave for the ACC because the Big East is 
going down. And, I think Pitt can be competitive in football in the ACC. In 
basketball, we are probably going to get steamrolled for the first few seasons 
but the ACC is a recruiting draw and with our coaching staff, we should only 
get better. But to say we need WVU is rediculous. Why do we need WVU for 
anything? Sure the backyard brawl is great but&nbsp;Pitt can do without it. I 
realize you think I'm hating on WVU by bringing up the fact that the ACC and 
SEC have completely rejected the school and the BIG XII only looks at WVU as a 
last resort. You have to admit that WVU has poor academics, facilities and no 
media market share. It's simply a fact. Plus traveling to WVU is a nightmare. 
Teams have to fly into Pittsburgh and drive for over an hour. Pitt isn't 
perfect. But it is more attractive than WVU in just about every aspect. Keep in 
mind that I did attend WVU before transfering to LSU. I spent two years at the 
school so I do have a pretty good idea about the school.</p> <br>

refusing to up the exit fee.<br>

Doesn't take a genius to see these

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  This is a perfect 
example of just how desperate the Big East is getting.&nbsp; If you look at the 
seven teams mentioned in the article, only Boise State has BCS type 
credentials.&nbsp; Boise State is really out of the question because of the 
distance between Boise and the Big East teams.&nbsp; The other six teams are 
simply NOT BCS Caliber.&nbsp; If West Virginia or Louisville leaves the Big 
East, they are finished as a legitimate BCS Conference.&nbsp; Everyone knows 
that West Virginia will take any offer that any other BCS Conference may 
make.&nbsp; Louisville is seen as the #1 target of the Big 12-3+1, if Missouri 
is accepted by the SEC, leaving the Big 12-3+1 a 9 team conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Big East is at the mercy of both the Big 12 and the SEC.&nbsp; It is time 
for those two conferences to put the Big East out of it's misery. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  DaveDawg, your GCC East 
looks OK except you really need to can Georgia State.&nbsp; I can't even find 
anything about a Ga St football team.&nbsp; What conference are they in?&nbsp;
<br> <br>
 Why would you include Louisville&nbsp;but not Cincinnati?&nbsp; 
They're not far apart.&nbsp; With Cincy in your&nbsp;east division it would 
look pretty good.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 I don't think Memphis and Tulane are gonna 
cut it if you're going for BSC status.&nbsp; In this scenario, which we both 
know ain't gonna happen, I'd court BYU for the west and maybe add FIU to the 
east and move UAB to the west.&nbsp;<br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  
*****BernieRotton********, why do you make stupid, uneducated, discriminating 
remarks towards WV? Or are you just speaking from your A**. WVU will do just 
fine with or without Pitt, or anyone else that leaves the conference. Pitt 
leaving the conference for the ACC will be the single biggest mistake the 
university will ever make. Pitt will be of no relevance in this conference in 
football.&nbsp; Basketball...well, you guys are an outstanding program! I think 
Pitt will do well in the ACC. But lets get back to football. Without WVU, there 
would be no Pitt football. Same kind of situation for us, as much as I would 
hate to say it.We kind of&nbsp;need each other.&nbsp;I believe that you think 
Pitt is a national power. They are far from it. The championships Pitt won are 
decades old, some even older.&nbsp;Today, Pitt has talent, as does WVU, but 
neither team is ready for&nbsp;a national championship.&nbsp;We are both just 
not that consistant. We can't even recruit the best players in the country. 
When we can recruit like LSU and Oklahoma, then we can look for the next 
level...not jump conferences out of desperation. The&nbsp;Big East is probably 
dead for football. WVU will , in my opinion, not stay. But if we do, WE will be 
the only reason the Big East will keep AQ status. But thats a longshot, because 
WVU will leave and don't be surprised that we end up in the ACC or SEC or BIG 
12&nbsp;even after all the&nbsp;so called turndowns. We are a wanted team, just 
as Pitt was. Don't forget that Pitt owes a lot to WVU as so does Pitt. Nobody 
would even care about either of us if it were not for the&nbsp;brawl. Another 
thing, you all wouldn't have electricity if it weren't&nbsp;for people from WV. 
You also wouldn't have your steal without the electricity we provide. Please 
think before you comment. You only make yourself look&nbsp;pathetic.&nbsp; <br>

SMU<br>
Houston <br>
Tulane <br>
So Miss. <br>
Memphis <br>
Louisville <br>
