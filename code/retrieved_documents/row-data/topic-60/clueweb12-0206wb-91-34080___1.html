<h2>Rozsa Center presents: Monty Python&rsquo;s Spamalot</h2> 
<h3>Posted on 18 November 2010</h3> 
<p>The Rozsa Center brought a welcome relief for busy students last Thursday, 
Nov. 11, when it brought the touring production of Spamalot to its stage. The 
musical, &ldquo;lovingly ripped off from the film &lsquo;Monty Python and the 
Holy Grail&rsquo;&rdquo; in its own words, was very well received by the Rozsa 
audience.<br>
 The musical tells a parody of the legend of King Arthur, much 
like the film it is adapted from. After gathering a number of knights for his 
Round Table, Arthur and his knights are tasked by God to seek the Holy Grail. 
During their search, they suffer a series of misadventures, including a 
murderous rabbit and a French castle where the inhabitants shout random insults 
at Arthur and his knights. Eventually, it is revealed that to find the Grail, 
Arthur must put on a successful Broadway musical, which is resolved when it is 
revealed that the cast is already in a Broadway musical. Arthur marries his 
love, the Lady in the Lake Guinevere, and the knights return to Camelot, ending 
with an encore audience sing-along of &ldquo;Always Look on the Bright Side of 
Life.&rdquo;<br>
 Much of the show&rsquo;s humor derives from playing with the 
very medium the show exists in. The show gives little heed to the fourth wall, 
and completely demolishes it at the end of the Broadway musical subplot. Many 
of the songs openly mock common themes of Broadway shows, such as &ldquo;The 
Song that Goes Like This,&rdquo; a pastiche of the common kind of Broadway song 
&ldquo;that starts off soft and low, and ends up in a kiss,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;The Diva&rsquo;s Lament,&rdquo; where the Lady of the Lake breaks 
character to complain that she hasn&rsquo;t been onstage since the end of the 
first act.<br>
 The show was well received by the audience, many of whom were 
fans of the original film. Of the Michigan Tech students in the audience, many 
were grateful for the chance to relax as exams approach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen 
it before, but [it was] a nice mid-week break,&rdquo; said Tech student Sean 
Debrusschere. He said that his favorite part of the show was the 
&ldquo;Lancelot scene&rdquo; in which Sir Lancelot goes on a murderous rampage 
to rescue who he believes to be a princess in distress, but turns out to be a 
boy whose father is marrying him against his will. The scene ends with Lancelot 
coming out of the closet, noting, &ldquo;a thousand years in the future, this 
will still be controversial.&rdquo; Jeanette Head, another Tech student agreed, 
stating that she was &ldquo;very amused&rdquo; by the show.</p> <br>

<h2>10 tips to make the most of Thanksgiving break</h2> 
<h3>Posted on 18 November 2010</h3> 
<p>1. Plan your break ahead of time, including time for both relaxation and 
studying.<br>
 Build in free time in your schedule, but make sure you remain 
disciplined about how much free time you allow yourself. It&rsquo;s easy to get 
to the Sunday before classes resume and realize that break was entirely wasted!

<h2>Culture Shock #19</h2> 
<h3>Posted on 22 April 2010</h3> 
<p> Last week, last article! 10 days to leave Houghton and 13 days to leave 
America! I&rsquo;m doing this countdown at least 10 times a day. I cannot wait 
any more to go back home. I know you guys have the same feeling, don&rsquo;t 
you? Well, first thing first, before we leave school, we need make sure all the 
final exams are doing well. I don&rsquo;t want to bring a bad GPA with me to 
home. It&rsquo;s shame. Chinese go back home only with awards.<br>
 This last 
one is kind like a wrap up for my column this year.<br>
 First of all, I would 
like to thank all of you for reading my articles this school year. It has been 
a great time for me to write this column. It gives me a chance to think about 
how different culture is between two countries. Hope you guys enjoyed those 
articles and have some general ideas about my country after reading them. China 
is still a miserable place for most western country people. There are too many 
thing need be found out. But because of my knowledge limitation, I&rsquo;m 
afraid I have to stop at this point and leave more rooms for you guys to 
discover by yourselves. Just like what I&rsquo;m doing here.<br>
 Culture is a 
very interesting topic to talk about. It affects how people think, live and 
make decisions. People respect each other from different culture backgrounds. 
I&rsquo;m going to take a class called Communication Between Different Cultures 
next fall. It should be fun. So I can learn this from a professional way.<br>
 
Final exams week is almost here. I bet all of you are working super hard to get 
a good grade to stay on the den&rsquo;s list. So do I. From my past experience, 
if you take some time review all you have learned this semester and do some 
practice exams, you should be fine.<br>
 Do you have any friends graduating 
this May? Sure you do. It is always sad to say goodbye. There are five senior 
students are graduating from my organization and enterprise team. I promise I 
will pass the torch and teach new guys just like what I have been taught. Come 
back and visit any time you feel free. Tech is always your home!<br>
 Oh, by 
the way, please don&rsquo;t be mad if I never reply your facebook messages. It 
has been blocked for a while in China. Can someone take care of my Happy 
Aquarium? We can talk on Skype though. Just search my real name on Skype you 
will find it easily. I&rsquo;m a MILES of SMILE.<br>
 Well, here&rsquo;s the 
end of the column. But our life will keep going, on the journey to success. I 
love you all and have a great summer. See you next fall!</p> <br>

<h2>Beat the blues</h2> 
<h3>Posted on 04 March 2010</h3> 
<p>You stare out the window and all you see is gray. The trees are desolate, 
frail arms reaching towards an empty sky. Faces are pale, wanting, yearning, 
hoping. And still the winter loves to tease us with its bouts of sunshine when 
you just know another snowstorm is around the corner.<br>
 Seasonal Affective 
Disorder (SAD) is not as serious as it sounds. It is commonly known as the 
Winter Blues or a time during the winter when depression is a direct effect of 
the environmental surroundings. It is common in Upper Michigan where sunshine 
is rarely seen during the mid-portion of winter.<br>
 Are you a victim of SAD? 
Common symptoms of the mild wintry disorder include difficulty waking up in the 
morning, oversleeping or overeating, craving for carbohydrates (weight gain), 
lack of energy, difficulty concentrating which in turn leads to depression and 
pessimism.<br>
 Behold! There are treatments for SAD that can prevent the 
weight gain and &ldquo;sad&rdquo; emotions. One such treatment is light 
therapy, which uses a light box that emits full spectrum light at 10,000 lux.
<br> Some people turn to tanning beds to get their sunlight fix, which can also 
be effective in the treatment of SAD, though not always healthy.<br>
 Of 
course, there is always the choice of turning to drugs to help lift your mild 
winter depression, though personally not recommended. I don&rsquo;t mean like 
marijuana, I mean official pharmaceutical drugs like anti-depressants. Come on, 
get your head out of the gutter.<br>
 The last and final treatment for SAD is 
negative air ionization. There is a release of charged particles into the 
subject&rsquo;s sleeping environment. It is usually used with another sort of 
treatment for SAD to make the lasting effect stronger.<br>
 Personally, I do 
not turn to any of these treatments as a means of a cure for my Seasonal 
Affective Disorder. I look to physical activities to do outside such as 
snowboarding or sledding. I have found that being outside and participating in 
an active lifestyle during the winter has helped with the SAD. I also turn to 
music for help. Rhythms and beats have a powerful effect on my mood. I have 
found that while in the palm of my music, I am very vulnerable. It is very 
important to choose uplifting music for this kind of situation.<br>
 You will 
know SAD when you see it. It is like the swine flu, always on the prowl, 
looking for its next victim. Usually in mid-December it begins to shine its 
ugly face down upon the campus of Michigan Tech. Students begin yearning for 
Christmas break and it always seems too far away due to the large amount of 
end-of-the-semester exams standing in the way like fat bouncers in leather 
jumpsuits. They cackle maniacally bearing their silver teeth. There is always 
no hope until that final exam is finished. If you see a friend or a loved one 
showing symptoms of this disorder, steer clear.<br>
 If you are stuck at home, 
snowed in most likely, and need a means of escape away from the depression, I 
highly HIGHLY recommend video games. There is nothing like a good round of Call 
of Duty to cure my mood. Or if I become consumed by a horror survival game, 
there is no thought of this SAD. Suddenly I am thinking, what depression?</p>

<h2>Culture shock #16</h2> 
<h3>Posted on 17 February 2010</h3> 
<p>Welcome to a new week! I know some of you guys are still busy with exams, 
but don&rsquo;t be upset. Take a break and learn about some Chinese culture!<br>
 I hope you enjoyed the article last week. As I said, this week I&rsquo;m also 
going to talk about Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). There are over 20 
different methods. I think acupuncture treatment is the most famous one you are 
familiar with.<br>
 Let us do a very quick review and background. TCM is 
largely based on the philosophical concept that the human body is a small 
universe with a set of complete and sophisticated interconnected systems. And 
those systems usually work in a balance to maintain the healthy function of the 
human body. TCM has a unique model of the body, notably connected with the 
meridian system. Unlike the western anatomical model, which divides the 
physical body into parts, the Chinese model is more connected with function. In 
this complex human model, the body is divided into a couple hundred points 
according to their functions. Chinese ancestors named all the points and passed 
this knowledge from one generation to another. Now I wish I had been born in a 
doctor&rsquo;s family&hellip;<br>
 That is the basic theory of acupuncture. 
Since the human body is defined as having many kinds of bodily fluids going 
through it, humans would get sick if these fluids couldn&rsquo;t escape through 
certain points. That&rsquo;s why acupuncture was invented, to dredge those 
points and refresh the fluids.<br>
 Acupuncture is the procedure of inserting 
and manipulating needles into various points to relieve pain or for therapeutic 
purposes. Acupuncture is an amazing physical treatment and nowadays technology 
still cannot explain some of its concepts.<br>
 At the beginning of 20th 
century, as modern, western medical treatment methods were introduced to China, 
fewer and fewer people actually learned this skill. In my hometown, as far as I 
know, there is only one doctor who knows acupuncture and he&rsquo;s already 80 
years old. Compared to western medicine, it takes more than three times the 
amount of time to learn TCM. People prefer to take pills when they are sick 
instead of putting a bunch of stainless steel needles into their bodies.<br>
 
Why don&rsquo;t we have an example here to make it more clear? Let&rsquo;s say 
one of your friends has a headache because of four exams in a row and he 
studied too much. In Western medicine, the typical treatment will be an 
analgesic, such as aspirin, to dilate the affected blood vessels in the scalp. 
But in acupuncture, a common treatment for such a headache is to stimulate the 
sensitive points that are located roughly in the center of webs between the 
thumbs and the palms of the patient&rsquo;s hands. These points are described 
by acupunctured theory as targeting the face and head which are considered to 
be the most important points when treating disorders affecting the face and 
head.<br>
 Although Western medical theorem replaced most parts of TCM, the 
medical system between China and America is still quite different. When I was 
filling out a safety form for my spring break trip last week, I asked my friend 
what a family physician is. He was surprised that I don&rsquo;t have a family 
doctor. Only rich Chinese citizens can afford private doctors.<br>
 Well, 
that&rsquo;s all I know about acupuncture and I hope you at least get some idea 
from my explanation. See you next week then!</p> <br>
