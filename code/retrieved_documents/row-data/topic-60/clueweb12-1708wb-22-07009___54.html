<h2>Memphis to the Big East: A Good&nbsp;Fit?</h2> 
<p>Feb 8</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>Today, the University of Memphis is expected to announce that it is leaving 
Conference USA for the Big East beginning in 2013.&nbsp; For some time, there 
has been discussion that the Big East should add Memphis to the conference, 
especially with the upcoming departure of Syracuse and Pittsburgh to the 
ACC.&nbsp; Even legendary Louisville basketball coach, Rick Pitino, called for 
the conference to add Memphis to its stable of schools.&nbsp; With Memphis set 
to announce its departure to the Big East today, is the pairing a good fit?</p> 
<p><strong>Basketball</strong></p> 
<p>One thing is certain:&nbsp; The Big East is known for its basketball 
talent.&nbsp; Last year&rsquo;s NCAA Division I Basketball National 
Champion&ndash;UConn&ndash;hails from the Big East and the Big East Tournament 
held every year at Madison Square Garden is a favorite amongst basketball fans.
</p> 
<p>Memphis will arguably be set to compete with the Big East in terms of 
basketball.&nbsp; The Tigers boast a 1,406-820-1 all-time win/loss 
record.&nbsp; In 2008, the school was runner-up in the NCAA Division I 
Basketball National Championship game.&nbsp; Since 2003, Memphis has made the 
NCAA tournament an impressive seven times.&nbsp; The Tigers will likely make 
another run this March.</p> 
<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p> 
<p>While the Big East is known for its basketball talent, it is also known for 
the spectacular facilities its teams get to play their basketball games 
in.&nbsp; Many basketball fans argue that the Big East tournament is one of the 
best each season, if only for the fact that it is played in Madison Square 
Garden.</p> 
<p>Like St. John&rsquo;s, which plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, 
Memphis also has an impressive basketball facility.&nbsp; The Tigers basketball 
teams call the 18,119 seat FedExForum home.&nbsp; The $250,000.00 million 
dollar state-of-the-art facility is also home to Memphis&rsquo; NBA team, the 
Grizzlies.&nbsp; The facility boasts an impressive five levels and over 100 
concession stands.&nbsp; Built seven years ago, the FedExForum also has a 
22&times;38 square foot scoreboard, which according to the FedExForum, is one 
of the largest in the nation.</p> 
<p>Memphis also has a decent football facility in the Liberty Bowl Memorial 
Stadium.&nbsp; The 61,000 seat stadium underwent $19.5 million in renovations 
in 1987.&nbsp; Telling by its name, it is also home to the Liberty Bowl game.
</p> 
<p>Given that Memphis has invested in its facilities, it is certain that other 
Big East teams and their fans will enjoy traveling to Memphis to watch their 
teams compete.</p> 
<p><strong>Finances</strong></p> 
<p>While Memphis&rsquo; facilities are certainly impressive, certain financial 
factors lead to questions as to whether the Tigers will be competitive in the 
Big East.</p> 
<p>According to data obtained from the Department of Education, in both 
2009-10 and 2010-11, neither the Memphis Football nor Men&rsquo;s Basketball 
teams turned a profit.&nbsp; In 2009-10, Memphis Football had expenses and 
revenues of $11,557,329.00, for a profit of $0.00.&nbsp; In 2010-11, Memphis 
Football had lower expenses and revenues than those of 2009-10, at 
$8,609,503.00, for a profit of $0.00.&nbsp; In 2009-10, Memphis Men&rsquo;s 
Basketball had expenses and revenues of $6,113,027, for a profit of 
$0.00.&nbsp; In 2010-11, Memphis Men&rsquo;s Basketball had expenses and 
revenues of $6,739,131.00, for a profit of $0.00.</p> 
<p>A profit of $0.00 is not necessarily a negative factor.&nbsp; In 2010-11, 
Big East competitor Louisville turned a $27,551,289.00 profit with its 
men&rsquo;s basketball team.&nbsp; However, that same year, the UConn 
basketball team&ndash;which won the NCAA Division I National 
Championship&ndash;suffered losses of $417,181.00.&nbsp; Thus, there clearly is 
a large range between the profits and losses incurred by Big East teams in a 
given year.&nbsp; Arguably, as long as Memphis stays out of the red, it should 
be able to compete financially with other Big East members.</p> 
<p>In terms of recruiting expenses, in 2010-11, Memphis ranked 40th in the 
NCAA, spending a total of $961,150.00 on recruiting for all of its teams and 
$759,844.00 for its men&rsquo;s teams.&nbsp; While ranking 40th in all of the 
NCAA is arguably an impressive feat, Memphis will likely have to increase its 
recruiting budget to keep up with those of its new Big East peers.</p> 
<p>In 2010-11, the following Big East schools ranked and spent as follows in 
terms of recruiting:</p> 
<p>Notre Dame:&nbsp; 3rd, $2,070,316.00</p> 
<p>Marquette:&nbsp; 11th, $1,461,373.00</p> 
<p>Louisville:&nbsp; 25th, $1,128,645.00</p> 
<p>Thus, Memphis will now be recruiting against schools with much larger 
recruiting budgets.&nbsp; As such, it would be in its best interest to attempt 
to spend at least $1,000,000.00 on recruiting for all of its teams combined.</p>
<p><strong>Media</strong></p> 
<p>One factor about Memphis which is likely attractive to the Big East is its 
media presence.&nbsp; Memphis ranks as the48th largest television market.&nbsp; 
While this number in and of itself does not scream huge media ratings for the 
Big East, it is important to compare how it stacks up to the media ratings of 
those schools leaving the Big East.</p> 
<p>Arguably, in finding a new member, the Big East would want to find 
candidates on par with those schools leaving, so as to fill their 
&ldquo;shoes&rdquo; upon their departure.&nbsp; Memphis nicely fits this 
mold.&nbsp; While Pittsburgh was ranked the 23rd largest television market, 
Syracuse was ranked the 81st.&nbsp; Thus, Memphis&rsquo; 48th ranking falls 
nicely in between Pittsburgh and Syracuse&rsquo;s rankings, arguably pleasing 
the Big East.</p> 
<p>In all, Memphis appears to be a worthy candidate for Big East 
membership.&nbsp; If the Tigers can turn a profit and increase their recruiting 
expenses, Memphis should be largely competitive in the conference.</p>

<h2>Notre Dame Recruiting&nbsp;Expenses</h2> 
<p>Feb 1</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>In terms of recruiting expenses, the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame put up a 
good fight when stacked against other programs&rsquo; spending.&nbsp; In 
2010-11, Notre Dame spent a grand total $2,070,316.00 on recruiting.&nbsp; This 
amount was the third-highest in the NCAA, and the highest in the Big East, the 
conference in which Notre Dame is a member.</p> 
<p>Seeing that Notre Dame spent $376,114.00 more than the next highest 
recruiting spender (Alabama) in the NCAA, leads one to wonder what exactly the 
$2,070,316.00 was spent on.</p> 
<p>Tom Nevala is Notre Dame&rsquo;s Senior Associate Athletics Director for 
Business Operations and Youth Programming.&nbsp; In his Business Operations 
role, he oversees all financial matters for Notre Dame&rsquo;s athletic 
department.&nbsp; Nevala was willing to help provide insight into how Notre 
Dame&rsquo;s large recruiting budget is spent.</p> 
<p>When asked how the athletic department&rsquo;s budget is structured in a 
given year, Nevala provided the following insight:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are two components to what a team believes their budget should 
be:&nbsp; What it has been and what is newly required going forward.&nbsp; We 
participate in the university&rsquo;s budget process.&nbsp; We have to seek 
approval for our budget.&nbsp; We have a net revenue target that we have to 
meet for the campus.&nbsp; Our budget only grows if we get approval to grow and 
we can meet the revenue target.&nbsp; Teams put forth their budget requests, 
and if we can meet those two things, we grant their budget accordingly,&rdquo; 
explained Nevala.</p> 
<p>Nevala&rsquo;s explanation pointed to a significant factor for Notre 
Dame&rsquo;s extensive recruiting budget:&nbsp; the fact that Notre Dame 
athletics drives a significant portion of the university&rsquo;s revenue.</p> 
<p>According to Nevala, the Notre Dame athletics department is committed to 
providing $20 million worth of revenue to the university.&nbsp; This $20 
million is additional to the amount of money the athletics department spends to 
fund all of the department&rsquo;s scholarships.&nbsp; The $20 million worth of 
revenue provided by the athletics department to the university is used by the 
university to fund other students&rsquo; financial aid and to cover operating 
expenses.&nbsp; As for where the athletics department obtains the revenue from, 
Nevala explained that, &ldquo;The revenue mainly comes from football ticket 
sales.&nbsp; We also have the benefit of a strong broadcasting relationship and 
fundraising,&rdquo; said Nevala.</p> 
<p>The athletics department&rsquo;s ability to turn over $20 million worth of 
revenue to the university as a result of its football team&rsquo;s success is 
arguably a reason why nearly one-half of Notre Dame&rsquo;s entire recruiting 
budget is spent by the football team.</p> 
<p>In 2010-11, Notre Dame&rsquo;s $2,070,316.00 recruiting budget was spent as 
follows:</p> Team Recruiting Expenses Percentage of Total Recruiting Expenses 
<br> Football $1,008,028.00 48.7% <br>
Men&rsquo;s Basketball $304,252.00 14.7% 
<br> Women&rsquo;s Basketball $198,021.00 9.6% <br>
All Other Men&rsquo;s Teams 
$300,328.00 14.5% <br>
All Other Women&rsquo;s Teams $259,687.00 12.5% <br>
<br>
<p>The link below is a pie chart depicting just how much of Notre Dame&rsquo;s 
recruiting budget is spent by particular teams:</p> 
<p>Notre Dame Recruiting Expenses</p> 
<p>While the fact that 48.7 percent of Notre Dame&rsquo;s entire recruiting 
budget was spent by the football team may seem outrageous to some, several 
factors must be taken into consideration.&nbsp; First, unlike sports like 
basketball where only a handful of student-athletes are recruited during a 
given year, a school can be recruiting upwards of fifty or more football 
players in a given recruiting year.&nbsp; Nevala also noted that travel 
expenses are higher depending upon when a recruit visits Notre Dame.&nbsp; For 
instance, hotel prices in South Bend, Indiana, where Notre Dame is located, 
skyrocket when the Fighting Irish are playing a home football game.&nbsp; If a 
football recruit is visiting for a game, this factor increases the cost of 
recruiting him.</p> 
<p>While Nevala confirmed that the vast majority of recruiting expenses 
incurred by every Notre Dame team are travel related, he also explained that 
it&rsquo;s possible that Notre Dame&rsquo;s recruiting expenses appear 
significantly higher than other those of other schools, because Notre Dame is 
comprehensive in how it defines recruiting expenses.&nbsp; According to Nevala, 
Notre Dame tries &ldquo;to capture everything recruiting related&rdquo; when 
reporting its figures to the Department of Education.&nbsp; Examples he used 
included coach&rsquo;s cellular telephone bills, subscriptions to recruiting 
newsletters, meals, and recruiting brochures.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, Nevala indicated that Notre Dame&rsquo;s recruiting expenses 
may be higher than other schools&rsquo; because of the athletics 
department&rsquo;s focus upon recruiting the best talent nationally.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a pretty unique situation here.&nbsp; While we&rsquo;re a 
Big East conference member, across the board, all of our sports are competing 
nationally.&nbsp; That puts a different approach into recruiting 
nationally.&nbsp; We also fund all of our sports&rsquo; scholarships, so that 
tends to lead to a little bit more national recruiting,&rdquo; noted Nevala.</p>
<p>With its ability to generate a significant amount of revenue for the 
university, historical recognition as an athletics powerhouse and its desire to 
bring the best talent found nationwide to South Bend, one thing is for 
sure:&nbsp; Notre Dame&rsquo;s recruiting expenses will continue to lead the 
NCAA.</p>

<h2>Beyond Fundamentals: The Story of Bob Stitt and the Colorado School of 
Mines Football&nbsp;Team</h2> 
<p>Jan 6</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>On January 4, 2012, college football fans watched as the West Virginia 
University Mountaineers scored 70 points&ndash;the most points scored by one 
team in a bowl game&ndash;against the Clemson Tigers in the Orange Bowl.&nbsp; 
WVU wide receiver Tavon Austin, who runs the 40-yard-dash in 4.3 seconds, 
scored four touchdowns using a play that stumped Clemson&rsquo;s defense.</p> 
<p>After the game, a reporter commented to WVU head coach Dana Halgorsen, 
&ldquo;The guys are still trying to figure out that one play that was 
successful for multiple touchdowns.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s recorded as a pass, but it 
kind of&nbsp; looks like a volleyball tap-toss.&nbsp; What is that?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Halgorsen, smiling, responded, &ldquo;Well, my good friend Bob Stitt at the 
Colorado School of Mines, gave me that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In 2000, Bob Stitt received the head coaching position at the Colorado 
School of Mines in Golden, Colorado&ndash;a town, which prior to Stitt&rsquo;s 
arrival prided itself more upon the beer Coors Brewing Company makes than its 
college football team.&nbsp; Prior to arriving at Mines, Stitt worked as an 
offensive coordinator at Austin College in Texas and at the esteemed Harvard 
University.&nbsp; Before Stitt began his coaching tenure at Mines, the last 
coach to record more wins than losses during a career was the coaching duo of 
Elmer Capshaw and Tim Calahan, with a 4-2-1 record which was earned in the 
1922-1923 season.</p>

Colorado School of Mines.</p> 
<p>When Stitt arrived at Mines, he was met with a $5,500.00 recruiting 
budget.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t even going to send anyone 
anywhere.&nbsp; We just had to recruit in the Denver area and foot the bill 
ourselves,&rdquo; noted Stitt.</p> 
<p>However, in 2004, the face of the Mines football program began to change.
</p> 
<p>On July 27, 2004, a 6&rsquo;7&Prime; kicker who was on the honor roll each 
semester he was at Mines, was driving home to Colorado after completing an 
internship in California.&nbsp; Scott Hahn was looking forward to starting his 
senior year and returning to Golden for football camp.&nbsp; The long-legged 
Hahn was a talented kicker who also showed skill in punting.&nbsp; There were 
rumblings that his abilities could land him in the NFL.&nbsp; However, with his 
kind disposition and impressive academic record, there was no question that 
Hahn would become a successful professional, whether it was in the NFL or 
elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Driving through Utah, Hahn fell asleep behind the wheel of his car.&nbsp; 
His car ultimately rolled several times.&nbsp; Hahn was taken to a hospital, 
where he later passed away at the tender age of 21.</p> 
<p>On a morning in early August 2004, when in previous years, his teammates 
would have been busy on the gridiron during two-a-days, Hahn&rsquo;s teammates 
were dressed in freshly pressed black suits and sitting in the front pews of a 
Catholic Church in Hahn&rsquo;s hometown of Aurora, Colorado.</p> 
<p>Stitt eulogized Hahn.&nbsp; He mentioned that the previous season, Hahn 
came into Stitt&rsquo;s office and asked to change his number to 12.&nbsp; Hahn 
could not give a serious reason for why he wanted to change his number, but he 
knew he wanted to.&nbsp; Stitt granted his request and during his junior 
season, Hahn played as number 12.</p> 
<p>Perhaps it was premonition, or maybe it was just a 20 year-old who on a 
whim, felt like wearing the number 12.&nbsp; However, one thing is 
certain:&nbsp; the Mines football team had found its 12th man.</p> 
<p>In that moment, the nature and culture of Mines football changed.</p> 
<p>In 2004, the Mines football team dedicated its season to its fallen 
teammate, Scott Hahn. # 12 patches were sown onto the chests of player&rsquo;s 
jerseys.&nbsp; Paper reminders were posted in the locker room of what the team 
was striving to do for Scott:&nbsp; Win every game.</p> 
<p>That season, the Mines football team recorded its best record in school 
history.&nbsp; The team went 12-1, losing a bitter playoff game in Pittsburg, 
Kansas at a place called &ldquo;The Jungle.&rdquo;&nbsp; That season, the team 
went 8-0 in its conference, the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference.&nbsp; Its 
quarterback, Chad Friehauf, won the Harlen Hill Award, which is Division 
II&rsquo;s equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.</p>

player Scott Hahn--the 12th Man Memorial--stands. Photo credit: Alicia Jessop.
</p> 
<p>While the premature death of Hahn arguably fueled the Colorado School of 
Mines Orediggers to win on the football field in 2004, the coaching of the team 
by Stitt during that season and in subsequent years provided the team with the 
skills necessary to be competitive.</p> 
<p>Perhaps what has made Stitt the most successful football coach in Mines 
history, is his ability to be an innovative play maker.&nbsp; That innovation 
is what the world learned about when WVU&rsquo;s Holgorsen credited him with 
the play which ultimately led the Mountaineers to score the most points in a 
bowl game.</p> 
<p>In 2003, Mines began running the Fly Sweep play in practice.&nbsp; It is a 
play intended to get the football into the hands of the wide receiver.&nbsp; 
The play without any modification is risky, because it involves the quarterback 
remaining stationary while the receiver runs at full speed.&nbsp; If the 
receiver doesn&rsquo;t slow down while making the play, the team runs the risk 
of fumbling the ball.</p> 
<p>That season, Stitt realized that the play was taking too much time to 
practice for the amount of benefits Mines was receiving from it.&nbsp; As 
coaches do, Stitt continued to break down the play in his head to determine 
what he could do to make it successful.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;One day, it just hit me.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t we put it up in the 
air?&nbsp; It was kind of like a reverse, and a lot of the time, you just put 
the reverse in the air.&nbsp; If we did that, the kid doesn&rsquo;t have to 
slow down and if he drops it, it&rsquo;s an incomplete pass, because it is a 
forward pass.&nbsp; Just a simple little change like that made it so 
effective,&rdquo; Stitt explained.</p> 
<p>Yes, Coach Stitt, a simple little change.&nbsp; A simple little change, 
that apparently Stitt was the only coach in the country to grasp onto and teach 
his team.</p> 
<p>Using the modified Fly Sweep play in 2004, Mines was able to break the 
school&rsquo;s season passing record with 4,766 yards.&nbsp; That year, it also 
broke the school&rsquo;s completions record (401) and yards in a season record 
(6,894).&nbsp; In 2004, the Orediggers scored an impressive 515 points.</p> 
<p>What Stitt was able to do with a group of engineers that season was not 
lost on other coaches.</p> 
<p>Then the head coach at Texas Tech, Mike Leach contacted Stitt about trading 
film, because he wanted to see how the Orediggers were running the ball so well 
in a passing offense.&nbsp; According to Stitt, Leach was impressed with what 
he saw.&nbsp; Holgorsen was an assistant coach under Leach, so it is likely 
then that Holgorsen first was introduced to Stitt&rsquo;s Fly Sweep play, or 
what Holgorsen calls, &ldquo;Quick.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Later, Holgorsen would become the offensive coordinator at the University 
of Houston, a program long recognized for scoring many points.&nbsp; With 
quarterback phenom Case Keenum, Houston has only kept up with its notoriety of 
scoring many points.&nbsp; Under Holgorsen and today, Houston uses 
Stitt&rsquo;s Fly Sweep play.&nbsp; Stitt himself was there when Keenum learned 
how to properly complete the play.</p> 
<p>After meeting Holgorsen two years prior at a One-Back Clinic, Stitt found 
himself in Houston for a Mines alumni golf tournament fundraiser.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We played it in the morning.&nbsp; We got done and it was early 
afternoon, so I went over to the University of Houston to see if they were 
practicing.&nbsp; I knew that Dana had gotten the job there, and I walked right 
onto the field.&nbsp; Dana was working with the quarterbacks and he kind of 
noticed me.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo; and asked if 
I saw him running the Fly Sweep.&nbsp; I asked him why they weren&rsquo;t 
putting it into the air.&nbsp; He said he had forgotten that part of the 
play,&rdquo; said Stitt.</p> 
<p>Thereafter, Stitt showed Keenum how to run the play.&nbsp; It took Stitt 
three minutes to instruct the quarterback how to run the play.&nbsp; Since 
then, Houston has relied heavily on the play to amass points.</p> 
<p>Much has changed in Golden, Colorado since Stitt began his tenure as the 
Orediggers&rsquo; head football coach.</p> 
<p>Downtown Golden has been completely renovated.&nbsp; Mines has greatly 
increased its student population.&nbsp; And the football team has seen winning 
seasons since 2004.</p> 
<p>Today, Stitt&rsquo;s recruiting budget is much larger than the $5,500.00 he 
was met with in 2000.&nbsp; Stitt estimates the team spendss $30,000.00 to 
$40,000.00 in recruiting new players.&nbsp; However, one thing that 
hasn&rsquo;t changed is the method by which Mines recruits&ndash;a method 
unique to the school&rsquo;s rigorous academic curriculum.</p> 
<p>To put into perspective the rigor of Mines&rsquo; academic curriculum, in 
2006 and 2007, Mines played in a post-season bowl game, the Dixie Rotary Bowl 
in St. George, Utah.&nbsp; The game fell during finals for Mines 
students.&nbsp; Given this, after 2007, Stitt told the RMAC commissioner that 
Mines would never go back to play int eh game.</p> 
<p>How many other college coaches in America are telling their commissioners 
that they can&rsquo;t go to a bowl game because it interferes with their 
players&rsquo; finals?</p> 
<p>That being said, when recruiting, the first thing Stitt looks at is not how 
fast a kid can run the 40-yard-dash or how much he can bench press.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We recruit transcripts first.&nbsp; You have to see what kind of 
classes they&rsquo;re taking and how they score in math and science.&nbsp; We 
look at the film later, once we have a pool of kids who could do the 
engineering curriculum at Mines.&nbsp; Then, we recruit the best of those 
kids.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been really successful getting engineers who can play 
football,&rdquo; said Stitt.</p> 
<p>A 51-17 conference record.&nbsp; Four players who have made it to the 
NFL.&nbsp; An team-average ACT score of 29.</p> 
<p>It is safe to say, that Stitt has brought success to Mines football.</p> 
<p>And its safe to say, we&rsquo;ll be seeing his Fly Sweep play when the 
Orediggers take Brooks Field this fall.</p>

<h2>Big East Financials&nbsp;&rsquo;10-&rsquo;11</h2> 
<p>Dec 20</p> 
<p>Posted by bcsguestwriter</p> 
<p>The next conference we&rsquo;re looking at is the Big East. The&nbsp;ACC
&nbsp;andBig XII were posted earlier today. The chart is sorted by &rsquo;10-11 
profits for each football and men&rsquo;s basketball program from greatest 
profit to least. The &ldquo;% Invested&rdquo; column shows how much of the 
specific sport&rsquo;s revenue goes back into that specific sport.&nbsp;<strong>
Please read below before viewing the financials</strong>.</p> 
<p>About the data:&nbsp;All of the data is from reports each school files with 
the US Department of Education. It is the only available data for both public 
and private universities. However, there can be variances in how each school 
chooses to report data. For example,&nbsp;each school can decide for itself 
whether to break out television revenue by sport or leave it in a generic 
revenue category, which causes variances. After speaking with dozens of schools 
the most common practice appears to be attributing the majority of television 
revenue to football and a portion to basketball. The most common split is 65/35.
</p> 
<p>There are also variances from year-to-year, so be careful when comparing 
this data to last year&rsquo;s data. For example, Florida State&rsquo;s 
football program showed a gain of approximately $14 million from 
&rsquo;09-&rsquo;10 to &rsquo;10-&rsquo;11. When contacted for comment FSU 
explained that in &rsquo;10-&rsquo;11 they broke out contributions by sport, 
which they hadn&rsquo;t done previously.</p> 
<p>Although far from perfect, this data is the only available data for all 
Division I programs. We just want to make you aware of the possible variances 
and will let you draw your own conclusions.</p>

<h2>San Diego State Takes Calculated Risk Joining Big&nbsp;East</h2> 
<p>Dec 15</p> 
<p>Posted by bcsguestwriter</p> 
<p><strong>Guest author: Dr. Michael Lorenzen</strong></p> 
<p><em>Dr. Michael Lorenzen is the principal owner of Collegiate Athletics 
Strategy Advising, a firm that provides advisement services to collegiate 
athletics administrators&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>One of the most significant trends to impact intercollegiate athletics in 
the last several years has been conference realignment.&nbsp; While some of the 
most landscape-altering changes have probably already been completed, there is 
almost certainly going to continue to be movement as universities make 
decisions that may seem to contradict completely the traditional understanding 
of conference membership.&nbsp; After all, the historic significance of 
collegiate athletic conferences has been to organize a group of universities 
around a common sense of mission, history, size, and geographic location in 
order to create affiliations and rivalries that benefit all involved.&nbsp; In 
that context, it is reasonable to ask how in the world some of the latest 
changes make any sense at all&ndash;does San Diego State really fit in the Big 
East?</p> 
<p>There is a fairly straightforward analytical approach to evaluating that 
sort of move and in the case of San Diego State, the financial bottom line 
would suggest that the move makes both dollars and sense.</p> 
<p>The <strong>first consideration</strong> for most schools is the most 
obvious one&ndash;what sort of media rights contract exists in the target 
conference and how does that compare to their current situation?&nbsp; San 
Diego State has been a member of the Mountain West, which was likely paying out 
up to $1.9 million per institution per year according to Boise State President 
Bob Kustra.&nbsp; By comparison, the Big East media deal was projected to pay 
$3.7 million per year to football schools.&nbsp; A gain of $1.8 million per 
year could be a powerful incentive.</p> 
<p>At the same time, that Big East deal pales when compared to the other 
conference negotiations in the last several years.&nbsp; The new Pac 12 
contract, which will begin with the 2012-13 season, will be worth more than 
$225 million per year &mdash; or $2.7 billion over the life of the deal, 
according to the Sports Business Daily and The Associated Press.</p> 
<p>The ACC currently operates under a deal for $155 million a year, and the 
Big 12 reached a deal with Fox that made its total annual package worth about 
$130 million.&nbsp; The SEC gets $205 million per year and the Big 10 gets $220 
million.&nbsp; Though there is clearly some variation in the number of ways 
each of those pies gets split, a $10 million per year distribution per school 
is rapidly becoming the norm.</p> 
<p>So what might the Big East alignment eventually net San Diego State? One 
former television executive consulting to the Big East estimates that the next 
Big East media package will conservatively bring $90 million per year.&nbsp; 
The current Big East practice is to split the total package with 70% going to 
football and 30% to basketball.</p> 
<p>As announced last week, the new Big East includes 8 full members: Houston, 
SMU, UCF, Cincinnati, Connecticut, Louisville, Rutgers, and USF.&nbsp; Boise 
and San Diego State have committed to be football only members, and the Big 
East could still land Air Force and Navy as football only members.&nbsp; The 8 
basketball only members would be: DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Notre Dame, 
Providence, Seton Hall, St. John&rsquo;s, and Villanova.</p> 
<p>Based on a $90 million annual package, there would be $63 million for 
football and $27 million for basketball.&nbsp; Given the projected membership 
above, that leaves a $5.25 million share for football only schools, a $1.687 
million share for basketball only schools, and a $6.937 million share for full 
members.&nbsp; Under that scenario, San Diego State could be increasing their 
annual take from football media rights from $1.9 million to $5.25 million, for 
a net gain of $3.35 million.</p> 
<p>The <strong>second consideration</strong> is the share of BCS revenue that 
a school in a conference with an automatic qualifying slot would gain as a 
result of their membership, assuming the conference has an equal revenue 
sharing agreement.&nbsp; The Big East currently has an AQ slot (the Mountain 
West has appealed for a spot).</p> 
<p>Under the current BCS arrangement, each conference whose team qualifies 
automatically for the BCS receives approximately $22.3 million in net revenue. 
A second team brings an additional $6 million to its conference. Notre Dame 
receives $1.8 million. Army, Navy and Brigham Young also receive $100,000 each, 
and each of the NCAA&rsquo;s Football Championship Subdivision conferences 
receive $250,000.</p> 
<p>At one point late in the season this year both Houston and Boise State were 
ranked in the top 10 in the BCS, which would mean $28.9 million for the Big 
East if both had been members and chosen for BCS games. Adding Houston, Boise 
State, and two other schools for football gets the Big East to 12 football 
members, which would yield a max of $2.4 million per institution from BCS 
participation if two schools were chosen to participate in BCS games.&nbsp; Add 
that $2.4 million to the incremental $3.35 million from the media rights deal, 
and now San Diego State is $5.75 million ahead on revenue by switching 
conferences.</p> 
<p>The <strong>third consideration</strong> is the impact on the cost side of 
the athletics equation.&nbsp; According to the US Department of Education, SDSU 
is currently spending $12.1 million on 121 football players, or $100.2K per 
player.&nbsp; That is almost double the median spending in the Mountain West 
conference in absolute terms and $39K more per player than their current peer 
institutions spend.&nbsp; This gives SDSU a fairly dominant position in the 
Mountain West.</p> 
<p>After taking out Georgetown (who does not play football at the BCS level), 
the median spending in the Big East on football is $12.6 million on 111 
players, or $112.1K per&nbsp;player.&nbsp; To rise to the median level of 
football spending in the Big East that would require an incremental $12K per 
player, or $1.45 million per year.</p> 
<p>Another important component of the cost bar is staffing.&nbsp; One way to 
quickly measure and benchmark athletic staffing levels is to evaluate the 
number of Full Time Equivalent positions in each department as reported on 
their websites.&nbsp; In order to match Big East average staffing levels SDSU 
would have to add a total of 12 staff FTEs.&nbsp; Relative to their peers in 
the Mountain West, SDSU would require an additional 9 FTEs.&nbsp; At an average 
of $60K including benefits that would require an additional $720K per year to 
match the Big East and $540K per year to reach Mountain West norms.&nbsp; Since 
SDSU is only participating in football in the Big East, let&rsquo;s assume that 
only 15% of staffing is attributed to football, or 2 FTEs.&nbsp; That would 
still require an incremental investment of&nbsp; $120K per year.&nbsp; Add that 
to the increased spending per player and you get an annual operating expense 
increase of $1.57 million per year, which still leaves a tidy net gain of $4.18 
million per year by switching football to the Big East.</p> 
<p>The <strong>fourth consideration</strong>, and one that gets dwarfed by all 
of the others in the current world of professionalized collegiate athletics, is 
the impact on the remainder of the athletic department.&nbsp; In the case of 
SDSU, the biggest factor is the effect on what is currently a very successful 
basketball program.&nbsp; Last year SDSU earned more than $1 million profit 
from basketball operations on revenues of $4.7 million.&nbsp; The Mountain West 
median basketball profit was $300K on median revenues of $2.9 million, so SDSU 
has a very strong and successful position compared to their current peers.</p> 
<p>With the move of the football team to the Big East, SDSU had to find a new 
home for all of the other sports since the Mountain West was no longer 
interested in having the school without football.&nbsp; The destination 
conference is the Big West, which is generally a weaker conference in terms of 
revenue and level of play.&nbsp; Last year the Big West median revenue on 
basketball was $1.4 million and not a single school reported a profit, with 
several losing money.</p> 
<p>If SDSU approximated the rest of the Big West as a result of lower level of 
competition, smaller venues, lower attendance, lower level recruits, etc., it 
would be reasonable to assume that SDSU basketball would become a break-even 
enterprise.&nbsp; The impact on the department as a whole would be a reduction 
in departmental revenues by several million dollars and departmental income 
available for supporting other sports/programs by $1 million.</p> 
<p>Under the best case scenario, where the Big East lands a media rights deal 
worth $90 million a year and has two teams in BCS games, SDSU stands to gain 
$4.18 million per year after deducting incremental spending on football. 
However, on the other end of the spectrum, the worst case scenario could cost 
SDSU approximately $770,000 per year, which would involve no increased media 
rights deal and loss of AQ status in the Big East and decreased basketball 
revenue consistent with typical Big West basketball revenue.</p> 
<p>Those are likely the most significant considerations for a university in 
SDSU&rsquo;s position and the ones that would be expected to drive the final 
decision.&nbsp; More difficult to quantify are issues like the impact on 
football student-athletes from a more demanding travel schedule, the effect 
that playing lower ranked teams has on recruiting and quality of experience for 
every other team in the department, and the overall message that accompanies 
the move.</p>

<h2>College Coach&rsquo;s Salaries: Big&nbsp;East</h2> 
<p>Nov 29</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>One conference that has been caught in the crossfire of conference 
realignment is the Big East.&nbsp; How do salaries of coaches in the Big East 
compare to those of other conferences?</p> 
<p>The data used for this analysis was obtained from reports filed by each 
school with the U.S. Department of Education, as required by Title IX.&nbsp; 
These reports are the only public documentation&nbsp; providing numbers for

<p>The highest average men&rsquo;s sports head coaching salary is paid by 
Pittsburgh, while the highest average women&rsquo;s sports head coaching salary 
is paid by Connecticut.&nbsp; In 2010, Pitt men&rsquo;s basketball head coach 
Jamie Dixon signed a new contract which made him the highest paid coach in 
Pennsylvania&ndash;yes, he was given a contract that paid him more than Joe 
Paterno.&nbsp; In 2010, Dixon signed a contract extension with Pitt through the 
2017-18 season.&nbsp; Prior to the contract extension, he was earning around 
$1.6 million annually from his Pitt salary.&nbsp; Geno Auriemma, the head coach

$1.6 million in salary last year.&nbsp; Connecticut also has the highest 
average women&rsquo;s sports assistant coaching salary.</p> 
<p>The lowest average men&rsquo;s sports head coaching salary was paid by 
Cincinnati.</p> 
<p>Villanova, a private institution, is home to the lowest average 
women&rsquo;s sports head coaching salary, as well as the lowest average 
men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s sports assistant coaching salaries.</p> 
<p>Like in the Pac-12 and SEC, there is a disparity between the amount of 
compensation coaches of men&rsquo;s sports receive and the amount of 
compensation coaches of women&rsquo;s sports receive.&nbsp; On average, 
men&rsquo;s sports head coaches earn 3.2 times as much as their women&rsquo;s 
sports counterparts.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s sports assistant coaches earn 2.2 times 
as much as their women&rsquo;s sports counterparts.</p> 
<p>These numbers are lower than the disparity in the SEC.&nbsp; The disparity 
for head coaches in the Big East is the same as that in the Pac-12, while the 
disparity for assistant coaches is less than that of the Pac-12.</p> 
<p>Another interesting feature of the Big East, is that it has both football 
competing members and non-football competing members.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
although Notre Dame competes in football, Notre Dame is an independent member 
in football.&nbsp; Calculating the average salaries of football competing 
members and non-football competing members (not taking into consideration Notre 
Dame in either calculation), head coaches of men&rsquo;s sports of football 
competing schools earn 1.4 times as much as their non-football competing school 
counterparts.</p>

<h2>WVU v. The Big East: Why The Big East Needs New Members&nbsp;Now</h2> 
<p>Nov 1</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s been a rocky few days for the relationship between West Virginia 
University and the Big East.</p> 
<p>On October 27, 2011, WVU was invited by the Big 12 to become a member of 
the conference. It accepted the Big 12&prime;s invitationthe same day.</p> 
<p>In recent months, the Big East has seen two of its member schools, Syracuse 
and Pittsburgh, defect for the ACC. Additionally, TCU, which was slated to join 
the conference beginning in 2012, opted out of that opportunity and instead 
chose to join the Big 12 next year.</p> 
<p>The Big East has steadfastly maintained that it will hold Syracuse and 
Pittsburgh to its bylaws, which require that teams give 27-months&rsquo; notice 
of their intent to leave and pay a $5 million exit fee. Since TCU never joined 
the conference as a participating member, it was not held to the notice 
provision but was only required to pay the $5 million exit fee. A copy of the 
Big East&rsquo;s bylaws is not publicly available.</p> 
<p>Things only got more difficult for the Big East on October 31, 2011, when 
WVU filed a lawsuit against the conference in an attempt to free itself from 
the 27-month notice provision and join the Big 12 next season.</p> 
<p>WVU&rsquo;s lawsuit seeks a declaration of its rights and obligations under 
the Big East&rsquo;s bylaws, asserts that the bylaws were breached and asks 
that the court prevent the Big East from holding WVU to the 27-month notice 
provision so that it can leave the conference next year.</p> 
<p>Two factual scenarios make up the factual bulk of WVU&rsquo;s claims 
against the Big East:</p> 
<p>1. Since 2003, the Big East has consisted of 16 member schools, with 8 
participating in football and 8 being considered &ldquo;non-football&rdquo; 
schools. In 2008, the Big East&rsquo;s bylaws were amended. In the bylaws, 
&ldquo;Football Action&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;Any matter which relates 
specifically to any participation in NCAA Division I-A football by Division I-A 
schools.&rdquo; Non-football schools are given an equal vote to the football 
schools on issues related to football. WVU alleged that, &ldquo;The 
non-football schools repeatedly exerted their newfound level of increased 
governance at the expense and to the detriment of the football schools.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>2. The real crux of WVU&rsquo;s lawsuit is that the exodus of schools from 
the conference has left the Big East unstable. As noted, WVU cites Pitt and 
Syracuse&rsquo;s departures for the ACC, as well as TCU&rsquo;s failure to show 
up for its first day at the conference, choosing instead to join the Big 12. 
The lawsuit also discusses the fact that UConn has publicly stated that it is 
pursuing opportunities with other conferences.</p> 
<p>WVU uses the factual scenarios related to the departure of Big East member 
schools to allege that the Big East failed to proactively maintain a level of 
competition, the remaining six football schools and eight non-football schools 
creates an imbalance and disparity of power and the current state of the Big 
East means that it is expected to lose its BCS AQ status.</p> 
<p>WVU&rsquo;s concerns set out in its lawsuit are realistic.&nbsp; 
Additionally, WVU was in a position to make these claims in an attempt to free 
itself of the 27-month notice provision because of the fact that the departure 
of Pitt, Syracuse and TCU arguably adversely impacted the state of the 
conference.&nbsp; Because Pitt and Syracuse started the defection movement, 
such arguments are likely unreasonable for them to make.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the 
merits of the lawsuit will be hashed out between lawyers and ultimately a judge 
in a courtroom.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, though, what is the Big East to do?</p> 
<p>The best thing the Big East can do, is to secure as new members 
football-participating members with proven records on the gridiron and located 
in strong media markets.&nbsp; And now, more than ever, the Big East must do 
this fast.</p> 
<p>By securing schools which will participate in football who have proven 
records of recent success on the football field as new members, the Big East 
will chip away at WVU&rsquo;s claims and likely secure its participation in the 
conference for the next 27-months. This is because new football members will 
restore the balance of power between football and non-football schools, while 
securing well-performing football schools in strong media markets will likely 
help the Big East maintain its BCS AQ status.</p> 
<p>The Big East will be a BCS conference through 2013.&nbsp; After that, AQ 
status for all conferences will be redetermined for 2014-2017 and it is unclear 
the precise criteria that will be used.&nbsp; However, team&rsquo;s 
performances between 2010 through 2013 will be used. Likely, the BCS&rsquo;s 
television contracts and the bowls themselves will drive the exact criteria 
used in selecting AQ conferences.</p> 
<p>Thus, it&rsquo;s in the Big East&rsquo;s best interest to secure schools 
who have performed well in recent years and also attract media viewership.</p> 
<p>Reportedly, the Big East is set to invite six schools to join the 
conference at a meeting which will be held today. Each of these schools would 
be a football participating member of the conference. The schools are: UCF, 
SMU, Houston, Air Force, Boise and Navy.</p> 
<p>With respect to the performance data the BCS will rely upon to select 
2014-2017&prime;s AQ conferences, only 2010&prime;s data is currently 
available. The following are rankings from the final 2010 BCS poll.</p> 
<p><strong>Team: Ranking</strong></p> 
<p><strong>TCU: 3</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Boise State:&nbsp; 10</strong></p> 
<p><strong>West Virginia:&nbsp; 22</strong></p> 
<p><strong>UCF:&nbsp; 25</strong></p> 
<p>Thus, in terms of maintaining AQ status for 2014-2017, TCU&rsquo;s decision 
to join the Big 12 over the Big East was more detrimental than Syracuse and 
Pitt&rsquo;s departures.&nbsp; WVU can argue that the loss of the number-three 
ranked team unduly damaged the Big East&rsquo;s chances of becoming an AQ 
conference in 2014-2017.&nbsp; However, by securing two schools ranked in the 
top-25 during 2010, the Big East can mitigate that argument.</p> 
<p>Therefore, long story short, the Big East needs schools with successful 
football teams to join its conference and it needs them to join fast.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, WVU may be packing its bags as soon as next season.&nbsp;<strong><br>

<h2>The Case for UCF to the Big&nbsp;East</h2> 
<p>Oct 19</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>Recently, the Big East announced that it wishes to add six football teams 
to its conference, bringing the conference up to twelve participating football 
teams.&nbsp; Several schools have been touted as being sought after by the Big 
East for this purpose, including the University of Central Florida.&nbsp; When 
looking at the business aspects of this move, it&rsquo;s clear why the Big East 
has its eyes on UCF.</p> 
<p><strong>Automatic Qualifier</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong>Arguably one of the biggest factors the Big East is 
concerned with when extending invitations to universities to join the 
conference, is that it maintains its BCS Automatic Qualifier status.&nbsp; UCF 
is poised to assist the Big East in accomplishing this.</p> 
<p>Last season, the UCF Knights finished ranked 25th in the BCS 
standings.&nbsp; Although this season the Knights only have a 3-3 record, their 
success last season arguably depicts that they are a football team to contend 
with and someone who will help the Big East maintain its BCS AQ status.</p> 
<p><strong>Football Revenue</strong></p> 
<p>While the Big East has formerly been known as a basketball powerhouse 
conference, the fact that the conference is specifically seeking out 
institutions to create a 12-team football conference depicts a shift in its 
sport of choice.</p> 
<p>UCF boasts football revenue that is on par with other Big East 
schools.&nbsp; The following depicts conference and institution football 
revenue for the fiscal period between July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010:</p> 
<p>Big East: $18.8M</p> 
<p>UCF:&nbsp; $15,173,200.00</p> 
<p>UCF&rsquo;s football revenue during this time period was greater than other 
Big East school&rsquo;s, including UConn, whose football revenue was 
$14,400,371.00.&nbsp; Additionally, another school the Big East reportedly has 
its eyes on&ndash;the University of Houston&ndash;only had football revenue of 
$7,719,733.00 during the period.</p> 
<p>Thus, UCF&rsquo;s football revenue puts it on par with other schools 
presently in the Big East and those set to join the conference.</p> 
<p><strong>Basketball</strong></p> 
<p>As noted above, the Big East has been known for some time as one of the 
biggest basketball contenders in the NCAA tournament.&nbsp; The Big East 
Tournament hosted at Madison Square Garden has always drawn a loyal 
basketball-loving crowd.&nbsp; With the defecting by Syracuse and Pitt to the 
ACC, the Big East arguably loses some of its basketball prowess.&nbsp; However, 
the conference remains a basketball talent hotbed, as teams such as UConn, 
Georgetown, Louisville and Marquette continue to be conference members.</p> 
<p>While UCF isn&rsquo;t on the same level in terms of basketball talent as 
these schools, it will likely be able to compete.&nbsp; The Knights made the 
NCAA tournament in 2005.</p> 
<p>Additionally, during the 2009-10 fiscal year, UCF&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s 
basketball team actually turned a profit.&nbsp; As seenhere, this is not 
something that every basketball team accomplishes.&nbsp; The fact that UCF 
turns a profit in men&rsquo;s basketball is arguably attractive to the Big 
East, as it was the only conference tomake more money from March Madness than 
the BCS during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 fiscal years.</p> 
<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p> 
<p>UCF&rsquo;s facilities are set for the big stage.</p> 
<p>The Knights&rsquo; football team competes in the Bright House Networks 
Stadium, which is the nation&rsquo;s newest college football stadium.&nbsp; The 
stadium is a 24-acre, 45,301 seat state-of-the-art facility.&nbsp; The stadium 
was built as part of a $60 million construction project, which also included 
building practice fields for the Knights&rsquo; football, soccer and baseball 
teams.</p> 
<p>The Knights&rsquo; basketball team also is sitting pretty in terms of its 
facility.&nbsp; Basketball games tip-off in theUCF Arena, which opened its 
doors in the 2007-08 season.&nbsp; This arena can seat 10,000 fans.</p> 
<p><strong>Market</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong>Orlando is a huge market that the Big East would be smart 
to tap into.</p> 
<p>While Orlando has the third-largest media market in Florida (behind Tampa 
and Miami), it is still the19th-largest in the United States.</p> 
<p>Additionally, in terms of licensing opportunities and merchandise sales, 
UCF is a great target.&nbsp; The school is the second-largest in terms of 
enrollment, after Arizona State University.&nbsp; In 2009-10, UCF received $3.3 
million in revenue from licensing, royalties, advertising and 
sponsorship.&nbsp; This number surpassed that earned by other schools in its 
current conference, including UAB, East Carolina and Memphis, by up to $2 
million.</p> 
<p>All in all, numerous factors make UCF a very favorable candidate for Big 
East expansion.</p>

<h2>Moving Perks: TCU to the Big&nbsp;12</h2> 
<p>Oct 12</p> 
<p>Posted by Alicia Jessop</p> 
<p>Mere weeks ago, many were drafting eulogies for the Big 12, as Texas 
A&amp;M announced its departure from the conference to join the SEC.</p> 
<p>However, with TCU&rsquo;s acceptance of an invitation to join the 
conference on October 10, the Big 12 not only gained a tenth member, but 
arguably reclaimed some stability.</p> 
<p>TCU is presently a member of the Mountain West Conference and was set to 
join the Big East next summer.&nbsp; However, in announcing that it will join 
the Big 12 in 2012, TCU effectively exited the Big East before ever competing 
within the conference.</p> 
<p>TCU&rsquo;s move to the Big 12 presents several incentives which will be 
enjoyed by the university and conference.</p> 
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Money</strong></p> 
<p><strong>a.&nbsp; For TCU</strong></p> 
<p>As noted above, TCU was set to join the Big East next summer.&nbsp; That 
being said, its 11th hour switch to the Big 12 does not come without financial 
consequences.&nbsp;Reports indicate that TCU will have to pay the Big East a $5 
million exit fee.</p> 
<p>Most would balk at the thought of a school shelling out $5 million to swap 
out its conference affiliation.&nbsp; However, the size of the Big East&rsquo;s 
exit fee and TCU&rsquo;s willingness to pay it signals just how much the school 
expects to gain financially by joining the Big 12.</p> 
<p>Last week, the Big 12&prime;s members voted to distribute revenue earned 
from its television contracts equally amongst its members.&nbsp;Presently, the 
Big 12 is a party to a first-tier television rights contract with ESPN worth 
$480 million.&nbsp; Next year kicks off the start of a 13-year second-tier 
television rights contract with Fox worth $1.17 billion.</p> 
<p>The Big East&rsquo;s first-tier television rights contract with ESPN 
expires in 2012 and is worth $200 million.&nbsp; The Big East is also party to 
a second-tier television rights contract with CBS worth $54 million.</p> 
<p>Thus, while for some it may seem preposterous that TCU was willing to fork 
out $5 million to exit a conference it never played a game in, its Board of 
Trustees arguably realized the television revenue earning potential the school 
could reap through Big 12 membership.</p> 
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; For the Big 12</strong></p> 
<p>Although some believed the Big 12 to be on its deathbed several weeks ago, 
the conference&rsquo;s extension of an invitation to TCU was not one made out 
of pity for the university.</p> 
<p>Rather, the Big 12 clearly realized the money-making potential TCU brings 
to the conference.&nbsp; TCU is located in Fort Worth, Texas, which is less 
than forty miles away from Dallas.&nbsp; Dallas is home to the fifth-highest 
rated TV market.&nbsp; This ranking makes Dallas the highest-rated TV market 
for all of Texas.&nbsp; By adding TCU to its conference roster, the Big 12 
enters this fruitful market and can use this to negotiate future TV contracts.
</p> 
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Geography</strong></p> 
<p>Along with providing the Big 12 with a connection to the fifth-largest 
media market, geography likely factored heavily into both TCU and the Big 
12&prime;s decision to join forces.</p> 
<p><strong>a.&nbsp; Recruiting</strong></p> 
<p>It is no secret that Texas is a hotbed for high school football 
talent.&nbsp; Securing a fourth Texas school into its conference gives all Big 
12 members a significant advantage over other conferences in recruiting this 
talent.</p> 
<p>Big 12 college coaches can lure Texas recruits to play for them by 
promising them the ability to play before their family and friends in their 
hometown.&nbsp; With four Big 12 teams being located in Texas, a recruit who 
signs with a Big 12 team will play at least four games a season in his home 
state.&nbsp; Additionally, schools like Oklahoma are a short drive away from 
TCU.&nbsp; Thus, non-Texas based Big 12 schools can likewise use the addition 
of the Fort Worth-based TCU to the Big 12 as a recruiting tool.</p> 
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; Costs</strong></p> 
<p>As noted above, TCU was set to join the Big East.&nbsp; While likely a 
small factor when considered in the grand scheme of things, the 
university&rsquo;s athletic department will incur much lower travel expenses by 
moving to the Big 12.&nbsp; Four of the ten Big 12 schools are located in 
Texas.&nbsp; When forced to travel outside of Texas, TCU will visit Oklahoma, 
Missouri, Iowa and Kansas.&nbsp; Had TCU remained in the Big East, it would 
have to travel on a frequent basis to places like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, 
New York, Wisconsin, Washington D.C. and New Jersey to compete.&nbsp; Staying 
closer to home undoubtedly curbs travel expenses.</p> 
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Football</strong></p> 
<p>TCU has had well-documented success on the gridiron in recent years.&nbsp; 
Last season, the Horned Frogs went undefeated in football and won the Rose Bowl.
</p> 
<p>The Big East has a storied history as a basketball powerhouse.&nbsp; In 
fact, its basketball teams perform so well, that it is one of the only 
conferences which earned more money from its basketball teams than its football 
teams.</p> 
<p>For the period between July 2009 to June 2010, TCU&rsquo;s football revenue 
was $20,609,361.00.&nbsp; The average football revenue for Big East teams was 
$18.8 million, while football revenue for Big 12 teams was $35.4 million on 
average.&nbsp; Thus, although TCU&rsquo;s football revenue is less than its new 
Big 12 peers&rsquo;, it was larger than teams in the Big East.&nbsp; By moving 
to the Big 12, TCU has arguably set itself on good footing to earn even larger 
amounts of money from one of the biggest revenue streams in college sports.</p> 
<p>All in all, it appears that TCU&rsquo;s move to the Big 12 is a win-win 
situation for the university and the conference.</p>
