<h1>&ldquo;A very wise coach once told me, &lsquo;If you really want 
play-action, you better pull a guard&rsquo;&rdquo; &mdash; Andrew Luck and 
Robert Griffin III agree</h1>  Monday, 23 April 2012 , by :  Chris <br>
<br>

<br> 
<p>The title is a quote from former Stanford and current San Francisco 49ers 
offensive coordinator Greg Roman, from the video clip below. And it&rsquo;s 
absolutely true. While much is rightfully made about whether a quarterback does 
an effective job of selling a run fake on play-action, the reality is that the 
offensive line plays just as big of a role in convincing a defense that a play 
is a run. Indeed, the play-action pass is probably the best weapon offenses 
have, one far too often underutilized by modern spread offenses. AsBill Walsh 
once explained:</p> 
<p>Let's go deep</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The Play-Pass is the one fundamentally sound football play that does 
everything possible to contradict the basic principles of defense. I truly 
believe it is the single best tool available to take advantage of a disciplined 
defense. By using the play-pass as an integral pant of your offense you are 
trying to take advantage of a defensive team that is very anxious very intense 
and very fired-up to play football. The play-pass is one of the best ways to 
cool all of that emotion and intensity down because the object of the play-pass 
is to get the defensive team to commit to a fake run and then throw behind 
them. Once you get the defensive team distracted and disoriented, they begin to 
think about options and, therefore, are susceptible to the running game.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>It is no surprise then that maybe the two best play-action teams in college 
football season were Stanford and Baylor, two teams that just so happened to 
produce the two best quarterbacks in college football, Andrew Luck and Robert 
Griffin III. In reviewing the game film of both players, I couldn&rsquo;t help 
but marvel at how many of their touchdown passes were well designed, well 
executed &ldquo;shot plays&rdquo; that, while impressive, pretty much just 
required both quarterbacks to throw the ball to wide open receivers. And a huge 
part of that was because both of their offenses involved heavy doses of 
play-action with pulling linemen.</p> 
<p>Just think about what kind of effect that has on the defense. While both 
players were impressive in their play-action fakes &mdash; and someone like 
Peyton Manning is even more impressive &mdash; if you&rsquo;re a linebacker or 
safety and you see a pulling guard, you basically can&rsquo;t help but tell 
yourself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a run.&rdquo; Especially since run plays that 
involve a pulling guard means one thing: &ldquo;power,&rdquo; in the lowercase 
sense of lots of bodies will be at the point of attack so the defense needs to 
match numbers as well. And in the case of both Stanford and Baylor it also 
means &ldquo;power&rdquo; in another sense: the&ldquo;Power-O&rdquo; play where 
the linemen block down and a backside guard pulls to lead. Stanford, being a 
more of a pro-style offense, runs the traditional Power-O numerous times every 
game. Baylor, being a spread team, typically used the vaunted&ldquo;inverted 
veer&rdquo; play, which is the spread offense&rsquo;s read-based adaptation of 
the old Power-O. Regardless, for opponents of both, a pulling guard meant 
trouble for Stanford&rsquo;s and Baylor&rsquo;s opponents run defenses, which, 
through the use of play-action, in turn meant trouble for their pass defense. 
That Bill Walsh guy just might have been onto something.</p>

<h1>How to Use &ldquo;Backside Tags&rdquo; to Attack the Entire Field in the 
Passing Game</h1>  Wednesday, 21 December 2011 , by :  Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><em>This article is by my friend Dan Gonzalez, who, in addition to being an 
expert on offense and the passing game, has written a book about both called
Concept Passing: Teaching the Modern Passing Game. Dan also previously 
collaborated with me on an articleabout the four verticals pass concept. I am 
honored to host his excellent article on Smart Football.</em></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Pick a side.&rdquo; This common coaching directive, in which the 
quarterback is given the autonomy to choose his starting point on a pass play, 
has always bothered me. It&rsquo;s an abdication of a coach&rsquo;s 
responsibility: It&rsquo;s the coach&rsquo;s job to orchestrate the assault on 
a defense &acirc;&#128;&#147;- why isn&rsquo;t the quarterback given a specific 
starting point and a full complement of options? Even as a college player, I 
would sit in meetings or pick up a game plan handout and roll my eyes when I 
saw these words attached to a pass play. My coaches were no slouches 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; there was an NFL pedigree throughout the staff, and they 
were fresh from coaching the first pick in the NFL draft when they came to my 
school. We were taught sound mechanics and fundamentals and our system was a 
complex pro-style system. Still, there was an abundance of mirrored pass 
patterns (see Diagram 1 below) in our system, where receivers on both sides of 
the formation ran the same routes. While these plays were sold as attacking the 
full field, I often thought to myself, &ldquo;If everyone comes open at the 
same time, aren&rsquo;t we really wasting half the field, and sometimes more 
than half of the eligible receivers?&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Diagram 1. Example of a &ldquo;mirrored&rdquo; pass pattern</strong>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I have always considered myself a sort of &ldquo;free thinker&rdquo; when 
it came to football. My talent would never have allowed for me to dream of 
playing after college (I considered myself blessed to be there), and I always 
knew I would go into coaching. When I studied our game tapes (I was in charge 
of the passing game quality control as a senior) and opponent scouting tapes, I 
was not only living in the &ldquo;now&rdquo; &mdash; I was also searching for 
the methodology that I would use when I finally got to run my own offense. Even 
then, there were two things I knew I wanted: (1) My system would establish 
itself with the dropback pass and (2) I was going to give the quarterback as 
many options as possible on a given pass play.</p> 
<p>In the passing system I have coached myself (and have since installed for 
my clients on a consultant basis), pass plays have &ldquo;frontside&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;backside&rdquo; component. They fit together through a system of pattern 
variations, or &ldquo;tags,&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ve created to give the 
quarterback a well defined method of attacking the full width and depth of pass 
defenses. There are three types of backside tags, each encompassing a specific 
way to affect the backside of a pass defense:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Provide outlets if the primary combination is covered.</li> 
<li>Control safety rotation or displacement.</li> 
<li>Prevent &ldquo;matching&rdquo; of the undercoverage.</li> </ul> 
<p>For this article, I&rsquo;m going to share a little of the thinking that 
goes into the first category of backside tags that we teach 
&acirc;&#128;&#147;- in our vernacular, these combinations are called 
&ldquo;Scan Reads.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Combining quick passes, run plays and screens in the same play</h1>  
Friday, 14 October 2011 , by : Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Given that humans lack clairvoyance, there is no such thing as the perfect 
play-caller and thus much of the development in football strategy has centered 
on how to get into (or out of) a given play because the defense is well suited 
to defend the one that was called. Indeed, quarterbacks have called audibles at 
the line of scrimmage for decades, and a few years ago the hot idea was calling 
multiple plays in the huddle.</p> 
<p>Let's not make this too complicated</p> 
<p>Most famously, Peyton Manning was supposedly given three plays to choose 
from on every down, though this was likely a bit of hyperbole. Calling two 
plays in the huddle remains very common, however. The method for this is 
simple: Two plays are called in the huddle, and then at the line the 
quarterback either confirms the first play (usually by saying a color) or 
&ldquo;killing&rdquo; the first play which indicates that the second will be 
run (by saying &ldquo;kill&rdquo; at the line). For example, the quarterback 
might call &ldquo;Red Right [formation] 24 Wham [run to the right] and 70 curl 
[pass play].&rdquo; At the line he&rsquo;ll either say the confirming word 
(i.e. &ldquo;Black! Black!&rdquo;) or will kill that play so they can run the 
pass play (i.e. &ldquo;Kill! Kill!&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good, but is still cumbersome and, most 
importantly, the defense can still make the offense wrong after the quarterback 
has made his decision at the line. Moreover, with the rise of no-huddle 
offenses, there aren&rsquo;t as many opportunities to call multiple plays at 
the line<em>and</em> have the quarterback check into one or another. The name 
of the game for defenses is confusion and movement, and even at the lower 
levels you never know how a kid might react. Increasingly, the answer to this 
has been to package concepts together, such that the quarterback has different 
options depending on what the defense does after the snap. Ipreviously 
discussed packaging quick passes with five-step or dropback passes together. 
This is a great concept, but is quarterback intensive: the quarterback has to 
look for the quick pass and then reset his feet with depth and then go through 
another progression &mdash; not something every quarterback can do.</p> 
<p>The answer has been to combine plays but to simplify the reads for the 
quarterback. There are three main forms this concept can take: (1) a base run 
play with a simple pre-snap backside pass concept built in; (2) quick passes 
combined with a draw play; and (3) quick passes combined with a screen pass. 
I&rsquo;ll discuss each in turn.</p>

<h1>Snag, stick, and the importance of triangles (yes, triangles) in the 
passing game</h1>  Tuesday, 09 August 2011 , by :  Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>When Sid Gillman revolutionized and all but invented the modern passing game
, he did it through a &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; approach to pass plays based on 
three &ldquo;pass concepts&rdquo;. Because football is governed by its 
immutable twins of strategy &mdash; arithmetic and geometry &mdash; these 
remain the foundation for all effective pass plays:</p> 
<p>Simple stuff</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Vertical stretches</strong> &mdash; These place two or three 
receivers at different levels vertically up the field to &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; 
the defense. Examples include thesmash concept and the frontside flood concept 
(seehere for a diagram and here for&Acirc;&nbsp; a video). Another name for 
these are high/low or hi/lo reads.</li> 
<li><strong>Horizontal stretches</strong> &mdash; These place two, three, 
four, or five receivers horizontally across the field or a portion of it to 
&ldquo;stretch&rdquo; defenders from left to right or right to left (or inside 
to out or outside to in). Examples includeall-curl.</li> 
<li><strong>Man or &ldquo;object receiver&rdquo; reads</strong> &mdash; These 
are not necessarily distinct from the above horizontal and vertical stretches, 
but the focus is on having a route or combination of routes that will defeat 
man-to-man coverage. Examples include themesh concept from the Airraid, bunch 
passes and option-routes.</li> </ol> 
<p>These three categories essentially made up the full panoply of choices for 
the passing game for, well, for a really long time. But at some point &mdash; 
most notably withBill Walsh&rsquo;s 49ers &mdash; a &ldquo;new&rdquo; concept 
began emerging, though it wasn&rsquo;t actually new at all but was instead a 
very clever twist on what Gillman had synthesized. Walsh realized that you 
could combine the horizontal and the vertical stretch to create a kind of 
&ldquo;new&rdquo; stretch, though one made up of both of Gillman&rsquo;s first 
two categories. Moreover, Walsh often combined the two zone beaters &mdash; the 
horizontal and vertical stretch &mdash; with the third category, the man 
beating concept, into a single &ldquo;triangle&rdquo; read that also was 
designed to defeat man coverage. If the perfect pass play was the Holy Grail of 
modern football, then the triangle is its best personification to date and 
Walsh its Galahad.</p> 
<p><strong>But let&rsquo;s take a step back to understand why the triangle 
stretch works</strong>, along with its negatives.&Acirc;&nbsp;The best vertical 
or horizontal stretches use more than two receivers, with three or more 
receivers being used in various &ldquo;zone flood&rdquo; routes. If you caught 
the defense in the right look it was mathematically impossible for them to 
defend you: If you ran the three-level flood route against Cover 2, they had 
two guys (a corner and a safety) to defend three receivers; and if you caught a 
Cover 3/4-under defense with your all-curl concept, it was easy pick&rsquo;ins:
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>All this has been detailed before, and if you can identify what coverage 
you are facing it is still better to run a true three-level vertical stretch or 
five-receiver horizontal stretch against the right coverage &mdash; if you get 
that right, there&rsquo;s very little the defense can do. But,&Acirc;&nbsp;of 
course, it&rsquo;s not so easy to figure out what coverage the defense is in<em>
before</em> the play; indeed, with the advent of combo coverages and pre- and 
post-snap shifts,&Acirc;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s often is difficult to even determine 
what the coverage was even<em>after</em> the play.</p> 
<p>Enter the triangle stretch. The insight behind the triangle is that the 
horizontal and the vertical stretch are combined to create a single 
straightforward read for the quarterback that provides answers no matter what 
the defense presents.</p> 
<p><strong>All of the major &ldquo;new&rdquo; (in relative terms) passing 
concepts are based on a triangle read.&Acirc;&nbsp;</strong>The weakness of the 
triangle stretch is that it&rsquo;s typically only possible to only get a 
two-man horizontal or vertical stretch, whereas with a true &ldquo;flood&rdquo; 
you can place three (or more) receivers across the field on a given plane to 
truly defeat a defense. This limitation means that a triangle can be throttled 
by certain coverages that rotate to the triangle side.</p>

<h1>Bobby Petrino&rsquo;s shallow cross concept &ndash; concepts, routes, and 
protection</h1>  Monday, 18 April 2011 , by :  Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The shallow cross is, quite possibly, the best pass play in football: 
Almost any quarterback can complete it; almost any receiver can run it (though 
there is more nuance than maybe one might initially realize to a good shallow 
route); it is a way to get &ldquo;speed in space&rdquo; without requiring a big 
arm; it works against most all coverages; and throwing a few of these tends to 
open up big plays downfield as defenders creep up.</p> 
<p>Score... heh heh heh...score...</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed lots of variants of the shallow, but one of my 
favorites remainsBobby Petrino&rsquo;s. I see Petrino&rsquo;s version as 
essentially the meshing of a pro style approach with a college sensibility; the 
reads are simple but there are nuances built in so that it works against almost 
any coverage. Petrino moves his guys around a bit, but, the key feature is that 
unlikethe Airraid guys, he has his runningback and his shallow going to the 
same side: the back runs a wheel route to pull the underneath coverage to the 
sideline and up the sideline, while the other two receivers run a post and a 
square-in, and on the backside the receiver runs a comeback. The base play 
looks like this:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The post and the wheel are &ldquo;alert&rdquo; routes, in that they 
aren&rsquo;t part of the basic reads but the quarterback can look at them first 
if the defense gives it. The most famous example of hitting the wheel was the 
second play of the game last season against Alabama. Alabama came outin a 
quarters or split safety look, but there was some coverage bust (it&rsquo;s 
hard to say exactly but it was probably the cornerback chasing the post route 
all the way inside, as shown in the video below).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>More typically, the goal is to hit the shallow, as the read is shallow to 
square-in to comeback on the backside. (Note that some people have said all 
routes should be read high to low, including the shallow. Although I think 
that&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb, that&rsquo;s all it is: the shallow needs to 
be the read before the square-in.) Below is a diagram and clip of the same 
concept, except Petrino now has the square-in/dig and the shallow coming from 
the same side.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here, Arkansas runs the shallow and the wheel to the short and tight side 
(short side of the field and where there is only a tight-end). The corner and 
safety drop deep, and the advantage of running the shallow to this side is the 
tight alignment brings the linebackers in, and the shallow ends up able to 
outflank those guys.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The read is the same though: Alert (post/wheel), shallow to square-in to 
comeback. I&rsquo;ve covered all ofthis previously, but it&rsquo;s worth 
mentioning again because don&rsquo;t take my word for it: Ryan Mallett 
explained it all to Jon Gruden recently. Jump to the 2:05 mark. (My favorite 
part of this is when Mallett begins discussing the hot reads and Gruden&rsquo;s 
eyes light up.)<br>

<h1>Teaching a quarterback where to throw the football</h1>  Tuesday, 04 
January 2011 , by : Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>If your quarterback can&rsquo;t deliver the ball to the open receiver, it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter how well designed, well protected, or otherwise well 
executed your pass plays are. Surprisingly, however, this supposedly natural 
skill &mdash; the ability to locate and throw the ball to an open receiver 
&mdash; is taught in a variety of ways, some more effective than others. To my 
mind, there are reallyessentially two legitimate methods: the progression read 
and the coverage read. (The illegitimate way is to simply &ldquo;scan&rdquo; 
across &mdash; the most common tactic when a quarterback who gets in trouble 
&mdash; but this should never be taught to a young quarterback as an every down 
technique.)</p> 
<p><em><strong>Progression Reads</strong></em>: A progression read is designed 
to have two, three, four, or five sequential choices of where to throw the 
ball. It is important for the quarterback to pre-read the coverage to get an 
indication of the coverage, but, more importantly, a progression read requires 
the quarterback to know where each of the receivers will be given the pattern 
called. This kind of read calls for throwing the ball with rhythm drops &mdash; 
i.e. on a five-step drop, the ball is thrown to the first receiver when the 
fifth step hits (the&ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; throw), the second receiver after a 
hitch-up or gather step (the&ldquo;read&rdquo; or &ldquo;gather&rdquo; throw), 
and the third receiver after resetting the feet.</p> 
<p><em>Limitations of progression reads</em>:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A tendency to stare at the receiver that is first in the progression, 
which attracts other defenders.</li> 
<li>It is frustrating for coaches to watch because they can see that a 
receiver who is later in the progression is wide open. Thus coaches need to 
know the progression as well as the quarterback &mdash; the QB&rsquo;s job is 
to throw it to the first open receiver in the progression.</li> 
<li>Quarterbacks will lose patience or think that because the first receiver 
in the progression was thrown to the first time that he won&rsquo;t be there 
when the play is called again. Progression reads require the coach/quarterback 
not have their mind made up ahead of time.</li> </ul> 
<p><em><strong>Coverage reads</strong></em>: The simple form of this requires 
that a pass concept be called and the quarterback is told to &ldquo;throw it to 
this guy if the defender does this; throw it to that guy if the defender does 
that.&rdquo; To make this work, the coaches and quarterback must understand the 
exact coverage called; there might be five receivers deployed but the coverage 
determines which two or three are &ldquo;live&rdquo; for the quarterback. In 
essence, the quarterback reads defenders, who dictate where the ball will go.

<h1>Running and throwing the fade route against press coverage</h1>  Thursday, 
14 October 2010 , by : Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>This past weekend saw that old classic, the fade route, used to win a 
couple huge games in the SEC: The game winner in the LSU-Florida game was a 
fade (the second try), and South Carolina&rsquo;s Alshon Jeffrey caught several 
big time fade passes against formerly #1 Alabama.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>As simple as it seems &mdash; &ldquo;Run out there and I&rsquo;ll throw it 
up&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s a surprisingly subtle play, and is often taught 
improperly. Steve Spurrier, of course, is one of the masters of the fade, and 
this isnot the first time LSU has won a big game on a well-thrown fade.</p> 
<p><strong>The first problem is the name, &ldquo;fade.&rdquo;</strong> This 
conjures up the idea that the receiver&rsquo;s job is to release off the ball 
and immediately start &ldquo;fading&rdquo; to the sideline, where the 
quarterback has to throw it to an increasingly vanishing spot between the 
defender and the sideline. This is wrong.</p> 
<p>1. The route, at least from the receiver&rsquo;s perspective, should be 
thought of as an almost totally vertical route. Against press man coverage,he 
should get the defender&rsquo;s feet moving; the goal is not to get 
&ldquo;around&rdquo; the defender but to get through him, by making the 
defender move and then having the receiver run on a path immediately past him. 
This isn&rsquo;t always possible, and the fade is an outside release play, but 
that should be the goal every time it is called. Too often young receivers want 
to outside release, get jammed, and can barely get off the line of scrimmage or 
get run basically out of bounds.</p> 
<p>2. Second, the receiver must leave at least six to seven yards between him 
and the sidelines. Some teach five yards but I prefer seven, because it leaves 
more margin for error. A simple way to think about it is to tell the receiver 
to get no wider than a yard outside the numbers (i.e. the big numbers on the 
field between the hashmarks and the sideline).</p> 
<p>3. Third, consistent with the above two points, the receiver should 
actually try to lean into the defender as he bursts upfield. As I&rsquo;ve said 
previously:</p>

<h1>How do you beat Cover 2 with trips? Let me count the ways</h1>  Saturday, 
09 October 2010 , by : Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Brian Cook of mgoblog put up some photos from last week&rsquo;s game 
between Michigan and Indiana, where Michigan pulled out the victory but 
Indiana&rsquo;s Ben Chappellthrew for 480 yards and three TDs, by completing 
over 70% of his passes. Most of these yards came from underneath throws, but 
Chappell hit a few big plays, including abig gainer on third and 16. Brian put 
up the photo below, followed bymuch hand-wringing:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Indiana uses the snag route concept to break a man wide open (shown below), 
and the question arises as to who to blame and if players were out of position. 
The above photo, however, shows most of what you need to see: you&rsquo;re 
probably in trouble. It&rsquo;s a wide trips bunch (trips but detached from the 
formation), the corner isn&rsquo;t in position to get a jam, and you&rsquo;re 
outnumbered. Being third and 16 it&rsquo;s not a given that Indiana could 
convert, but this defense is not well equipped for the formation. To 
illustrate, let me flip the question around: If you were IU&rsquo;s quarterback 
or offensive coordinator (or if you were Michigan and IU lined up like this 
against you), what would you call? The answer,most coaches would agree, is most 
anything you like, especially with the techniques Michigan used.</p> 
<p><strong>Counting game.</strong> As anyone who reads this site knows, all 
football begins as arithmetic. Were it not third and 16, the automatic 
adjustment you&rsquo;d see against this defensive look is thebubble screen.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This works because of numbers: there are three receivers against two short 
defenders; the deep safety is not in position to tackle the bubble for a short 
gain. (And if he is, you use the fake-bubble and go play.) But it was third and 
16 so you need to find a way to get the ball down field, or at least give 
yourself a chance to do so. Indiana called the&ldquo;snag&rdquo; concept. The 
purpose here is to form atriangle read, which is formed by combining a two-man 
&ldquo;vertical stretch, i.e. one guy high and one guy low, and a two-man 
&ldquo;horizontal stretch,&rdquo; i.e. one guy outside and one guy inside. As 
shown in the image, the corner route and the flat route form the high/low 
portion of the read, while the flat also forms part of the horizontal or out/in 
stretch, with the slant-sit or snag route forming the other part.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>On the actual play, the corner sat on the flat route and the corner route 
&mdash; one on one with the safety who had no help to either the inside or 
outside, and thus had little chance to make a play &mdash; was wide open.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This worked for the same reason the bubble screen worked: the cornerback 
(one guy) can&rsquo;t guard two guys (the corner route and the flat route). But 
let&rsquo;s say IU wanted to be more aggressive and wanted to attack more than 
just the corner; let&rsquo;s say they wanted to put pressure &mdash; and get a 
numbers advantage &mdash; against both the cornerback<em>and</em> the safeties. 
How would they do that? With the trustysmash concept with the divide route.</p> 
<p><strong>We all know why Cover Two is called Cover Two</strong>: It&rsquo;s 
because there are two deep safeties. Thus if you want to break someone 
downfield, you need to send three guys deep. The great thing about the smash is 
that you can outnumber the secondary both horizontally across the field (three 
guys running deep and stretching two deep safeties) but also vertically 
(high/low of the cornerback).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>From bunch, the outside receiver widens on his hitch route to get the 
corner to widen and then simply breaks down. The backside safety is occupied by 
the backside split end going deep, and, as a result, the trips side safety has 
to make a very unfortunate choice between one receiver breaking for the post 
and another breaking for the corner. (Tampa Two refers to a variation of Cover 
Two where the middle linebacker drops back to cover the middle of the field; if 
they use this your speedy receiver might still beat him down the middle, but if 
not you have the runningback on a checkdown over the middle.) I&rsquo;d say 
that if you play Cover Two against trips (which can definitely be done &mdash; 
more on that later), the first thing an opposing coach will try you with is the
smash with a divide or seam/post right down the middle.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say you are confident that you won&rsquo;t get much 
pressure on your passer, and you want to hit a downfield pass, high/low reads 
be damned. In that case you pick the most aggressive horizontal stretch of them 
all,four verticals.</p>

<p>Four verticals against Cover 3 [is] really a 2-on-1 against the free safety.
</p> 
<p>The QB is coached to look off the Free Safety and throw to the #2 receiver 
away from him. Well-coached safeties are instructed to not come out of the 
exact middle of the field until the ball is in the air. Four verticals against 
Cover 3 is not designed for the home run. The QB should deliver the ball on a 
relative line (a la Denard [Robinson] to [Roy] Roundtree in the spring game) at 
15-20 yards downfield; i.e., behind the LBs and in front of the Free Safety.</p>
<p>Right where you want them</p> 
<p>A properly coached Cover 3 defense will use its LBs to re-route and not 
give up easy seam throws. For a 3-3-5 defense, the alignment of the #2 reciever 
changes who is responsible for this. If #2 is a TE or Wing, then one of the 
Stack Backers (Sam, Will, whatever) is responsible for seam elimination (as we 
like to call it). If #2 is a wide slot, then either the Spur or Bandit is 
responsible.</p> 
<p>The objectives are threefold:</p> 
<p>1. Take away the quick seam throw by jamming and running with #2.<br>
 2. 
Widen the seam route to the Corner&rsquo;s zone, or outside 1/3. Do not let #2 
cross your face.<br>
 3. Get your eyes to #1.</p> 
<p>Once the jam and re-route is accomplished, the LB will key #1. If #1 
continues vertically up the field, the LB will continue to run with #2. If #1 
throttles down, the LB will come off #2 and get to his zone. The Stack Backer 
will hunt a crossing route by #1 while the Spur/Bandit will hunt inside-out; 
i.e., curl to deep out to quick out. This is an easy read but hard to get to 
quickly. The Spur/Bandit must be a superior athlete. (This is one of my 
reservations about Kovacs. I don&rsquo;t believe he can take away a seam and be 
able to get to a curl against quality QB/WR combos.)(more&hellip;)</p>

<h1>Smart Football Super Bowl Preview: Manning vs. Brees</h1>  Sunday, 07 
February 2010 , by : Chris <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Give the media two weeks before the Super Bowl and they will find every 
weird angle to take to fill the void: Who has the best food (uh, not 
Indianapolis);what U.S. Presidents are like what Super Bowl (In a matchup 
between Super Bowl III, with Broadway Joe, against Thomas Jefferson, the third 
President, Jefferson won because he &ldquo;wanted it more.&rdquo;); and opinion 
from every blustery ex-player and coach that can be found. But now that the 
game is here, there&rsquo;s one aspect that absolutely is at the top of my 
list: The game features arguably the two best quarterbacks in the league who 
run undoubtedly the best &mdash; and most interesting offenses.</p> 
<p><strong>Colts</strong></p> 
<p>The show Peyton runs is amazing not only because of its effectiveness, but 
also because of its simplicity. Indeed, in all but specialty situations they 
have basically two personnel groups &mdash; two wide receivers, two tight-ends, 
and one running back and three wide receivers, one tight-end and one running 
back &mdash; and they have run the same few plays for the last decade. They 
rarely shift and instead rely on Peyton to get them to the line and find the 
appropriate play.</p> 
<p>The theory for all this is simple. Although a defense has some options and 
disguise some things, there are only so many things a defense can do: they 
might be able to disguise press or loose coverage, or rotate the secondary or 
send an unexpected blitzer, but they can&rsquo;t move a cornerback from one 
side of the field to the other after the snap, and there might be blitzers but 
there are only so many candidates. As a result Peyton gets his team to the line 
and surveys the defense. Offensive coordinator Tom Moore typically sends in 
three plays: two passes and a run or two runs and a pass, and Peyton makes his 
choice among those three options. Typically, Manning gets the ball snapped with 
under six seconds left on the play clock; he both wants to take his time 
surveying the defense and limit late shifts before the snap.</p> 
<p>And Manning&rsquo;s menu of plays are both simple and have been constant 
for a decade. For runs, he basically has three choices:outside zone (the most 
common), inside zone, and draw (there are a few others mixed in as well). 
Believe it or not, the run game comes basically verbatim from what the 
University of Colorado did in the early 1990s (except for the option runs, of 
course) &mdash; football is not as complicated as people think.</p> 
<p>For the passing game, on early downs they run a lot of play-action, where 
the goal is either to beat the defense deep (through post routes and go routes) 
or to hit a deep void with a deep crossing route or corner. (The deep crossing 
route concept isdescribed here.) Another go-to concept is three-verticals, 
though Manning likes to look for the inside slight off play-action as a quick 
throw right behind the linebackers. (Video below courtesy ofBrophy.)</p> 
<p><em>Play-action from under center:</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Play-action from shotgun:</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>On passing downs and when Peyton is in the shotgun, you&rsquo;ll see most 
of the traditional routes that other teams run, but far and away his favorite 
is the &ldquo;levels&rdquo; play. It&rsquo;s almost idiotically simple &mdash; 
the inside receiver runs a ten-yard in route (often Dallas Clark) while the 
outside receiver (Reggie Wayne, most typically) runs a five yard in-route. 
Typically the linebacker runs with the slot and the quick five yarder is open, 
but once he&rsquo;s hit that a few times Manning will hit the inside square-in 
for an easy first down.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve described the &ldquo;levels&rdquo; concept (with video) 
previously here. Below is another diagram showing what typically happens with 
the coverage:</p>
