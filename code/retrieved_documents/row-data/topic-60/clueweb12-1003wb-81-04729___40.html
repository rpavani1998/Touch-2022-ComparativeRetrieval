Shouldn't the United States be better at soccer? 
<br>  Posted: 1722 GMT  Freddy Adu was touted as the next big thing in United 
States soccer but has so far failed to break through.<br>

<p>Is it just me or should the United States be better at soccer? </p> 
<p>With a population of over 300 million and with a large percentage of 
immigrants from countries where football is king, it is my belief there should 
be more talent in America.</p> 
<p>When Team USA lost to Panama and then had to battle long and hard to beat 
Guadeloupe in the Gold Cup, I thought it was time for a reality check. To be 
defeated by a team ranked 67 in the world and then barely beat another not even 
officially affiliated with CONCACAF, the regional football body that covers 
North and Central America and the Caribbean, is surely not good enough.</p> 
<p>Back in 1998, after a dismal World Cup campaign, the U.S. Soccer federation 
created &quot;Project 2010&quot;, a blueprint to make the national team a 
legitimate football force by that year. Resources were allocated to produce 
talented players and give them a structure in which to excel.</p> 
<p>Fast forward to 2011, and it is fair to say the project has failed. Team 
USA made the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 2002 during that period, but 
since then, they have failed to make their mark on the world stage. Advancing 
to the round of 16 at the last tournament in South Africa last year wasn't 
exactly what they had in mind.</p> 
<p>As worrying as the lack of success has been for the team as a whole, 
equally as worrying is the failure to find a phenomenon. Landon Donovan is a 
very good player, don't get me wrong, but with all the sons and grandsons of 
immigrants from Latin America and Africa, how has the system not produced at 
least one superstar?</p> 
<p>I remember all the fuss that was made around Freddy Adu. He was amazing 
with the American youth teams in his teens, even signing with the MLS as a 
14-year-old. People in States said he had the talent to become the next Pele, 
but that never happened. Where is Adu these days? He belongs to Benfica of 
Portugal but spent the last season on loan in the Turkish second division.</p> 
<p>In my view there is one key factor which means America will never be a 
force in world football, and it is quite a simple one. Soccer is not part of 
the country's culture. I lived in the States for nine years and although I saw 
many kids playing the game when they were young, they never saw it as a 
possible career. Most adults actually consider it to be a &quot;soft&quot; 
sport, some would even say it is a women's sport.</p> 
<p>Men in America prefer more physical sports and often dismiss soccer as a 
&quot;game for sissies.&quot; Furthermore, in the States, there are many other 
sports that football will never be able to compete with. American Football, 
Basketball, Baseball, NASCAR and golf, for example, all get more coverage and 
more attention than soccer.</p> 
<p>So, if there is one thing football officials would have to do to change all 
of this it is to market football in a different way. They don&rsquo;t have to 
spend money bringing the likes of David Beckham and Thierry Henry to their 
professional league, they have to go around schools with DVDs of Cristiano 
Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and company and actually show them how cool the sport can 
be from an early age. Perhaps this could be the foundation for a new generation 
of footballers, a &quot;Project 2020&quot; if you will.</p> 
<p>Changing the image of football will lead to changing the people who play 
it. The best athletes then may prefer to kick a ball rather than throw it.</p>

<p>Shouldn't we be getting better commentaries about American soccer by now? 
</p> 
<p>This is the same sort of analysis I've seen time and again by members of 
the foreign media who take five minutes to look at soccer in the U.S. and start 
drawing conclusions.</p> 
<p>I could point the author in the right direction to discover the reality of 
the sport's progress here, but when I read this broad, simplistic analysis, I 
really don't think it would be worth my time.</p> 
<p>Your readers deserve better.</p> <br>

<p>US National team needs to get rid of Bob Bradley and his boss, 
whoever/whatever his names is... + there isn't enough money in soccer like it 
is in American Football, Basketball, Baseball etc... Americans claim this sport 
to be for sissies??? I would love for those people to try playing for just 
30mins not 90mins and see if they still think that way...</p> <br>

<p>I could not disagree more with your &quot;it's not in our culture&quot; 
comment. I have played american football, men's League and college rugby, and 
men's league soccer and soccer by far is the roughest. Soccer requires a skill 
and finess that can not be made up for with raw athletic ability. As a left 
back I can run, attach the ball in the air and tackle all day, but I have 
nothing approaching the skill and deft touch of the midfielders. I find that 
men who play soccer have very litle patience with trying to explain the game to 
people who have not. when a generation or two grows up playing success and 
popularity will follow.</p> <br>

<p>I agree that we should be better and we haven't achieved all we wanted by 
2010 but in 2009 the men's national team beat the best team in the world 
(Spain) at the Confederations Cup and went toe to toe with Brazil in the Confed 
Cup Final. Not to mention, Major League Soccer is picking up steam and a soccer 
game is a real event in Seattle, Portland and Philly. It's getting there.</p>

<p>We ran into a problem. It is the USSF and specifically Sunil Gulati! . I 
wish I had a picture of him at the moment FIFA announced the US had not won to 
host another World Cup! It was priceless. He was frozen in shock. He dictates 
who the MNT coach selects and plays. Much of the blame must go to his coaching 
selections. Rongren was the U21 coach for many years. He is responsible for 
&quot;chasing away&quot; several very good young prospects now playing for 
other countries. Again a very arrogant close minded individual. The youth 
programs and leagues are money based and &quot;win at all costs&quot; to make 
the club and coach look good in order to attract the &quot;best&quot; players 
with money to inflate the club's accounts. None are about player developement 
and retention. Politics are a huge problem in USSF. Wrong people running this 
&quot;so called&quot; powerful organization. Sounds like our U.S. government. 
Specifically, Bradley does not possess player evaluation and game management 
skills. Not to mention player communication skills. He always takes the 
&quot;safe&quot; road. His lack of allowing &quot;creative play&quot; and 
&quot;1 2 quick one touch passing triangulation and penetration is obvious and 
very alarming at this level. My U19 team plays a better system of play than our 
MNT does. There are huge numbers of very capable and talented coaches and 
players in the U.S. The USSF is a close minded &quot;click&quot; and relies on 
it's &quot;own&quot; to provide information on players and coaches rather than 
allow all avenues of information to get to the decision makers within.</p> <br>

<p>I wish I knew how to get young US talent over to clubs overseas like 
Barcelona, or others with youth academy programs. That would be a start to help 
the US mens national team. I for one would do anything to send my youngest son 
overseas. I have a few boys, but my youngest who is 6 adores the sport, and 
those that see him play know he has a future in it. If soccer was important in 
the US I knew he would be noticed for an academy program like you find in 
England, and Spain.</p> <br>

<p>As an American-Argentine, I would like to say: &quot;Welcome to the 
club&quot;. Having watched Argentina win two world cups, only to be surpassed 
by Brazil, Germany, and Italy, you need to understand that this is one prize 
you can not win by using PowerPoint slides, or throwing money at it.. u need to 
bleed for it. It's not just another trophy, not just something u can take away 
for the weekend. This is a life long thirst that no one will let u just take 
home. If u want it, then earn it... Otherwise, keep acting like u dont care 
about soccer anyway...</p> <br>

<p>Do you know anything about the sport? We are much better than we were 10 
years ago with almost all of our players playing in the best leagues in the 
world here in England or elsewhere in Europe. We won our group in last year's 
World Cup and are favoured to win the Gold Cup. Living in London, I can tell 
you that no English person was happy to have to play us in the WC last year and 
everyone was happy to come out of it with a 1-1 draw. We are so much more 
respected now than we were 10 years ago but stupid articles like this are a 
weak attempt to keep our image at mediocre. Perhaps it's because more due to 
the fact that soccer is hardly an inner city sport in America, as Basketball 
reigns supreme, but it is with the middle class of America that can be seen 
kicking a ball around. That, combined with heavy snow in the northern parts 
make it difficult to play in the winter time unless there is an indoor facility 
nearby and this is typically reserved for the serious players. Oh, and did you 
really just compare soccer's popularity with NASCAR, a whitetrash competition 
that in no way should be honored with being in the category of 
&quot;Sport&quot;. It's no different than bowling or darts...tell me Dale 
Earnhardt could have ran a mile without a Marlboro. Highly unlikely.</p> <br>

<p>You can't buy football!! Especially on a national level. Every game has to 
have the heart and devotion of the players for it to become a success. 300 
million people means nothing! China is the second biggest economy and has 6 
times the population of the US... doesnt mean it will win the world cup, India 
same story. Apparently every country is good at certain things be it sports or 
other stuff.</p> 
<p>So I do believe that the U.S. should be way better due to the factors you 
listed, but once more its about loving to play the game and nothing more.</p> 
<p>Have you seen how the Spanish played? Do you watch big European clubs 
competing or even the quality of the Spanish/English/Italian/German leagues ... 
when there is a football match the weekly stuff people take a break and head to 
the stadiums or gather with friends to follow up. Because its a culture, but so 
far I do not see that in the US!</p> <br>

<p>The reason that soccer is not popular in the U.S. is because it is a mans 
sport. Unlike any other sport soccer requires a true athlete with real talent. 
Soccer is a test of skill and strength that goes non-stop for two 45minute 
half's. That is just it, soccer goes non-stop were you don't stop for a 
Budweiser or Doritos commercial and broadcasters can't get sponsors which means 
no money. No sponsors, no coverage, no money equals no sport. The truth is some 
of the highest paid athletes in the world are soccer players. The bottom line 
is more people watch the World Cup than all the Olympics combined. Soccer is 
the worlds sport and the U.S. is finally coming around.</p> <br>

<p>Anyone who lives in the US could have already told you this. Flat out no 
one cares about soccer in America, and why should they? How fun is it to watch 
a game for 3 hours only to have the final score 0-0? At least in hockey people 
beat the crap out of each other......but in soccer all people do is fall down 
and pretend that they were hit to get a yellow/red card. If I want to see bad 
acting, i'll go watch a movie with January Jones.</p> 
<p>I'll write another article complaining that since we have so many Chinese 
descendants in America, we should be pro at pingpong.</p> <br>

<p>Americans don't understand football (it's called football and not soccer).
<br> They like sports where they can be undefeated. Where they cand call 
themselves world champions although no one else in the world plays that sport.
<br> They also like sports that have a lot of time outs. That way they can 
relax in the sofa (or in the stadium) and get something to eat (their favourite 
sport). They don't understand football because they lack the ability to see 
beyond the shell. They come to Europe and what do they do? They go to the 
nearest MacDonald's!<br>
 To be a great football player, you must start from an 
early age playing it with your neighbours. Never mind colleage sport, it's in 
the streets where the big names of the sport are made. Americans think that 
Football is boring. One would think they never saw a baseball match! The 
timeouts of the game are bigger then the game itself.<br>
 On the other hand, 
football doesn't need the americans. Who needs them anyway!</p> <br>

<p>I'm from Asia and I love football. Went to America to study for two years 
and was both surprised and disappointed, football-wise. Surprised to see so 
many people (including Americans) actually love soccer. I played every two days 
and the field/court was always full. Disappointed with the fact that nobody 
actually cares about the development of the sport. After all, I love the US and 
have always supported their national team.</p>

<p>Great post Pedro, as a Portuguese citizen myself I also share your vision 
on the development of &quot;Soccer&quot; in the United States. With the amount 
of talented athelets on highschools and universities USA should easily be able 
to develop to it's full potencial in soccer...but as you say, the problem is 
not with the athelets, it is with the mentalities. I guess Americans just don't 
understand how beautiful the game is and how real competition in that sport 
really is exciting.<br>
 I hope American kids of this next generation can bring 
up this culture and mature in to something the US can be proud of.<br>
 Also, 
as a Benfica fan myself I would like to express my deep admiration of Adu's 
talent.</p> <br>

<p>We have the same problem in Australia. Passion, tradition and media 
enthusiasm are missing where soccer's concerned. The US has none of this, so 
will struggle in mens' soccer.<br>
 Winning a big international championship is 
the only thing that will give the mens' game a boost in the US.</p> <br>

<p>Im an italian/american, lived in the states for 7 years in chicago when i 
was younger, and yea, FOOTBALL didn't get much of the attention it deserved... 
specially in high school, i cant tell you how blatantly obvious it was that the 
sports teams budget was basically divided up like 60% to the American Football 
team, 30% to basketball and 10% to the soccer team......... Sissy sport... 
pfff, like a lot of you said, id like to see those people play for 30mins!... 
The fitness required for an all out 90min game on an 11 man pitch is just 
staggering... One last thing, half the, uhm, &quot;athletes&quot; in baseball 
and american football really shouldn't be regarded as such.... if your gonna 
play a sport professionally and get paid huge sums of money for it, then A. 
lose weight and get fit B. actually give it your all when playing :p Sorry for 
the rant FORZA MILAN!</p> <br>

been scratched, that has given it this image.</p> 
<p>As for American success in soccer, don't forget that the US knocked out

still drawing with Brazil at half-time going into the final. I don't call that

 You talked about snow in the winter months being a factor, but 
are you not aware that European countries also suffers from the same winter 
condition. I think a lot has to do with coaching. Kids are coached from early

<p>The structure to have fantastic local and national soccer teams has been in 
place in the USA for a very long time. Tell me one town, schoo or company that 
doesn't have some kind of team in place. Towns and cities have great fields and 
set up leagues for children as young as 4, elementary and high schools have 
their teams, the towns team structure and in many cases intramural teams; and 
the same for colleges and companies. So American children, young adults, men 
and women love watching and playing soccer.<br>
 Why don't we have a great 
national team.... soccer IS a very physical sport. 2 continuous 45 minutes of 
play.... it's hard to squeeze commercials into a game with few (if any) 
disruptions.<br>
 The lack sponsors for TV means lack of endorsements for 
players and lack of tv stations that are willing to cover live games...<br>
 
Given a choice of playing professional soccer where you have the financial 
limitations, or something else.... what would you choose?</p> <br>

<p>Soccer (football) is not a sport that is part of the North American 
culture. This sport is still taking baby steps trying to embedd itself into the 
Americana mainstream. All around the world, football is a part of the 
landscape, from the most empoverished country to the most afluent. You cannot 
simply take 10 years of publicity and make this sport part of the national past 
time. The US has made tremendous strides in their team's performance and has 
adapted well to the multinational styles of the game but still lacks the 
passion that the rest of the world has for the sport. It may have the financial 
backing but without the drive it will not move forward.</p> <br>

<p>Football, or &quot;soccer&quot;, as you americans still tend to call it, 
isn't a typical logically analaizable game. You are used to deal with avarages 
and percentages in sports like Tennis, American Football, basketball or 
baseball. But &quot;soccer&quot; is mostly about talent and what we in europe 
call &quot;in game events&quot; wich make it one of the most unpredictable 
sports to ever be created. It is useless to finance a team to grow into an 
arsenal squad in a determined year. what you need is culture, culture that 
countries like malaysia or india lack with soccer and have plenty of in 
crickett....it's impossible for the US to gain that culture by simply importing 
talent from it's immigrants...it might take at least 20 years before the US 
becomes top 10 in the world....but that won't happen before they will become 
aware of the sport, and that has yet to happen, not when baseball and 
basketball are around...and by fair trade...you can't always be good in 
everything.</p> <br>

<p>Soccer will never be big in America also because of one other thing: money. 
You see networks, corporate sponsors, and fans get half-heartedly behind the 
sport, but the money is nowhere near what it needs to be.</p> 
<p>Take for instance: England. You have a country of 57M citizens and 20 
Premiership teams there, and their expenditures PALES America's NFL with 30 
teams and 300M citizens. A while back, Chelsea was spending 172M GBP (278.4M 
USD) on player wages...that's 27 players...over 10M per player average on a 
team.</p> 
<p>The highest in 2010 for the NFL was the Washington Redskins at $178.2M for 
about 40 players or about $4.4M per player.</p> 
<p>And how does US's Major League Soccer compare?</p> 
<p>The average pay on the highest paid team (New York Redbulls) is a bit under 
$450K a year per player.</p> 
<p>The fact is to bring talent in and develop it here, you have to have money. 
You can't develop a whole league of top-flight players on a shoestring budget.

<p>futbol has to do with tradition and culture as it is with careful planning. 
Successful countries see it as a game, a pass time like music as opposed to a 
chance to show superiority. The plan to win the world cup in 2010 was a 
stupidly crazy idea I laughed at back in the 90s.</p> 
<p>Let it simmer naturally, build the tradition and results will come. The US 
has the strong organizational discipline, what it doesn't have is patience. 
Like music it needs to come naturally, just as Rock, the Blues, Jazz, Hip Hop 
it needs to come from the natural tendency of the people and then grow. You 
can't plan it, you can only nurture it.</p> 
<p>And please get some attractive, flamboyant chants. Enough with this USA,

<p>1)off-course the USA should be better at football/soccer. they have 
population of over 200 million people, most countries with large populations 
does well football.</p> 
<p>2) secondly the money, countries that do well at football are richer 
countries they can hire the best coaches and train the players with best 
services available</p> 
<p>3)third the USA was 3rd in the 1st world cup and did well in the 1st 20 
years at the world cup. plus they have qualified and for the last 5 world cups.
</p> 
<p>4) many big team's always say that the USMNt is very hard to beat at the 
world cup's they may not be the most talented but they know how to frustrate 
big teams</p> 
<p>5) Soccer/football is very much an American sport, its the most 
capitalistic sport there is clubs can buy many player they want and winners 
takes all.</p> 
<p>6) Americans love competitive sports and soccer is very competitive and 
like most sports in the USA it about heart, determination and have star 
player(s )to lead the team to glory and have supporting players who help the 
key players</p> 
<p>7) the only problem is that the USA have not found a playing style that 
suits them, they like most team's the world they have not adopted soccer into 
their culture. same way with the African team's and some European teams. eg</p> 
<p>Brazil, Germany and Italy are very successful because they understand 
soccer that have adapted it to their key strength</p> 
<p>8)Another problems is in soccer players don't go college they go to Soccer 
academies to improve their skills.</p> 
<p>9) The USA female team is the most successful team on the women's side and 
currently number one, if the women in the USA can do it why can the Men.</p> 
<p>10) My concern for the USMNT is that they do well when they have faith in 
themselves but once they stop believing they lose. They drew with Argentina and 
beat Spain when they had faith but when they played Brazil and Ghana they lost 
their belief. in soccer you need a fighting spirt and faith in your team and 
yourself to win . off-course you don't need arrogance but but respect of the 
game</p> 
<p>11) also the USA have talent, they need better scouts they should pick 
every type of player whether they are athletic or not whether big or small they 
should pick kids from all walks of life whether surban kids or kids in the 
streets. that's how other countries operate</p> <br>

<p>Its because they are such pussies now. they barely get touched and roll 
around on the ground holding their leg when someone bumped their arm. They get 
taken off on a stretcher then hop right up when the other guy gets a card. 
Their just actors.<br>
 I was really excited for the world cup then watch about 
half of a game and couldn't stand watching anymore because how dramatic they 
had to make everything. It was so much standing around waiting for guys to stop 
rolling around like a 5 year old that got pushed over.<br>
 I agree, it used to 
be a tougher sport, but it has changed. But if you want to say its tough 
because they run for so long then lets all go sit around and watch guys run a 
marathon. They will score about the same amount of goals and they don't stop 
when someone scrapes their knee.<br>
 It's popular with kids because it's cheap 
so parents have them play, but then the kids see that the only people that 
still play soccer after elementary school are the ones that got cut from every 
other sport.<br>
 It will never be popular in the US. We have better things to 
watch. I don't care if you say football is a lot of standing around. Let's see 
how tough a soccer player is when he gets the ball in the NFL.<br>

<p>(Hi, can you post this version instead? I made a couple of spelling and 
punctuation corrections. Thanks.)<br>
 I don't think Project 2010 was a 
failure. If you look back to where we were, when Paul Caliguri's &quot;Goal 
Heard 'Round the World&quot; helped qualify us for the 1990 World Cup after a 
40 year absence, to where we've come, with our finishing in the top 16 at the 
2010 World Cup, we've come a long way. And let's not forget that we beat Spain, 
the number ranked team in the world, and were up on Brazil 2-0 on a couple of 
beautiful goals, at the 2009 Confederations Cup. Not often noted, but the U.S. 
team was actually one of the more exciting teams to watch at this past summer's 
lackluster Cup. We had two come-from-behind draws or wins, whereas the world's 
big three (Messi, Ronaldo, and Rooney) failed to score a single goal between 
them. I read one blog of a guy who said he'd never watched a soccer game in his 
life, but he found the Slovenia game more exciting than any football or 
basketball game he'd ever seen. Don't get me wrong: I love college basketball, 
but when soccer is good, it's hard to beat. It's actually the absence of goals 
and all the close calls or near goals in soccer that raise the spectator's 
desire and make the actual goals so fulfilling. Oh yeah: back to the U.S. team 
Granted we have a huge drain of our talent into football, basketball, and 
baseball, etc., but I don't think that can account for the U.S. not being able 
to break into soccer's upper echelon. I was just an average kid, but I wrote a 
report about Pele in sixth grade, used to practice all the time against the 
back of my garage and the local kickboard, and dreamed of being a professional 
soccer player. Multiply that by thousands of kids across the country, and I 
don't think you can say the interest is lacking. Perhaps, just perhaps, it is 
the coaching. Bruce Arena did a great job at Virginia, D.C. United, and at the 
U.S. National Team, but when he went to a one forward lineup at the 2006 World 
Cup, that didn't bode well for either the team or his job prospects. To 
evaluate Bob Bradley's performance at the 2010 World Cup, let's look at one 
thing he did great. When the U.S. was down 2-0 against Slovenia, to start the 
second half, he brought Donovan up as a forward along with Dempsey and Altador 
for a three forward lineup, ala Brazil. It paid off handsomely, with Donovan 
scoring moments into the second half. Yet, when we were down one in overtime 
against Ghana, he did not pull Donovan up. We didn't score and were duly 
eliminated, losing our best chance in a long time to make it to the 
semi-finals. Now, a larger mistake than a lack of risk taking relates to our 
style of play. Soccer is about one thing and one thing only, in my view: 
possession. Statistics show that only one shot in nine scores, so the team that 
has the ball the most, shoots the most, and therefore scores the most. No team 
in the history of the game (as far as I know) demonstrated this better than 
Spain at the 2010 World Cup. Sure their style of play isn't as exciting as 
Brazil, but the way they passed the ball against Germany in the semi-finals, as 
if they had the ball on a string, was beautiful nonetheless. They achieved an 
astounding 89% success rate for their passes, and actually passed the ball 200 
more times per game than the tournament average. (For a nifty analysis of their 
passing, go to 
http://www.prozonesports.com/news-article-world-cup-2010-analysis.html.) The 
only time the United States played any possession soccer was during the first 
half against England. (By possession soccer I mean stringing together more 
than, say, three passes.) The rest of the time there was an inordinate amount 
of long balls send to Altidor and others. Long balls are not high percentage 
passes, for just like in basketball, the closer you are to your target, the 
more likely you are to hit it. So, even though the U.S. didn't get by Ghana 
(who did, after all, beat Brazil to win the under 20 World Cup the year 
before), Bob Bradley was given a fair shake and another chance to advance in 
the World Cup, but down the road we may need a foreign coach to bring about a 
change in our mindset and establish a possession game, the one thing that can 
perhaps take the United States to the next level.</p> <br>

<p>We are poor at soccer because we are not sufficiently technical let alone 
necessarily. When I have watched the US players I see a rush to kick the ball 
as far up the field as possible. In contrast, Spain and Barcelona start their 
attack from behind! Our Anglo-Saxon cousins are equally inept at world football 
because the English value industry over grace, or graft over gift. Look at the 
Japanese! They now have some fine ball players playing over at Inter and 
Schalke, players who know to caress the football.</p> <br>

<p>Soccer was at almost zero just 18 years ago in the US. Now it's probably in 
the top 5 of team sports and growing. There's a popular domestic league that 
makes money, and Europe has many players from the US. The USA has been the best 
team in CONCACAF for the past decade, though Mexico is making a big comeback in 
that respect. USA went from being a World Cup non entity to making the 
Quarterfinals in 02, flopping in 06, to winning its group in '10. US will only 
get better, though it needs some reorganization at the top (not going to 
happen), along with a coaching change (Bradley did OK but his style has gone 
stale.)</p> <br>

<p>Way to write an article filled with stereotypical depictions of the 
American view on soccer. Soccer is rapidly increasing in popularity and more 
and more children are following through with the sport in terms of not 
switching sports once they grow up... If we weren't becoming more and more 
soccer-aware then why would FOX, one of the major networks in the United 
States, broadcast the Champions League Final on national television? They 
certainly wouldn't do it if they didn't think anyone was going to watch it. Not 
to mention EA Sports' FIFA series sells more and more copies each year 
domestically and not to mention ESPN has made a concerted effort to give soccer 
more coverage.. So why don't you go do more research, then write a well 
informed article that makes you sound like you didn't just crawl out from under 
a rock... Yea maybe it was a bit unrealistic to set 2010 as a date for churning 
out global superstars but lets be real we're a top 20 soccer team in the world 
when playing at our best and the youth in our pipeline are going to do even 
better than their predecessors given the increases in the caliber of coaching 
we are currently able to provide..</p> <br>

<p>The nonsense about soccer not being taken seriously by the American public 
is way off. I do agree we should be better. The problem can be related to the 
&quot;Project 2010&quot; program. The US Soccer coaching education programs 
have killed the creativity of American players by focusing on &quot;coaching 
development&quot; rather than player development.</p> 
<p>Freddy Adu is perfect example. Here's a super-talented kid with skills 
beyond anything we have seen the US and he has been flop because coaches 
(highly educated coaches), both here and Europe (where coaching education is 
huge) choose to focus on what he can't do rather than what he can do better 
than anyone.</p> 
<p>Bob Bradley represents the US coaching philosophy. He preference for 
hard-working, simple players (like his son) over less predictable talents (like 
Adu or Jose Francisco Torres). This type of thinking filters down throughout US 
Soccer resulting in a very ordinary product on the field.</p> <br>
<br>
<b>
Mezzala.net</b> &nbsp; June 20th, 2011 5:59 am ET<br>

<p>The problem is not a lack of interest but a lack of coaching and 
infrastructure. England have a population of around 50 million compared to our 
300 million while we have 16 mls clubs, 5 NASL clubs, and 11 USL Clubs compared 
to England's 92 League clubs. Just assuming that those 32 American clubs are on 
par with England's in terms of youth development (which they obviously aren't) 
this means that American clubs are responsible for approximately 20 times as 
many people (1/3 number of clubs and 6 times the population)</p> 
<p>Another factor is price. Soccer normally falls into a similar demographic 
as basketball does in the US, impoverished families, but in the US local clubs 
charge upwards of $1000 (and do so rightly as they wouldn't exist without the 
funding) for players to travel whereas European clubs allow free to play 
opportunities. This leaves most US youth playing in poorly maintained 
environments with uneducated coaches and all of this fails to account for the 
fact that this simply shows how far behind the US is to England who are having 
their own problems developing players right now with a dismal performance in 
the World Cup and the u21 European championships.</p> 
<p>Their are plenty of interested youth but simply no way of training them 
properly. Look no farther than Guiseppe Rossi and Neven Subotic for proof that 
these so called imigrant's children ARE REAL but they only develop because they 
are trained by capable hands and not just foreign parents who were fans in 
their own country.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you think athleticism is an issue than you don't even 
understand the sport. The US were as athletic as anyone at the World Cup but 
lost out to well trained skill and intelligence. You think Spain won the World 
Cup because they had the best athletes? (they probably had close to the worst) 
They won because of La Masia and the ideology of one Johan Cruyff. I bet you've 
heard of him.</p> <br>

being a major player in world soccer. Should we be better? We certainly have

<br> The US have all the potential to do well even if it's not sport number 
one. When it comes to competitive countries that should be able to win a world

<p>Until the vast majority of Americans get over themselves and realize that 
there are other sports being played outside of the US borders (like soccer for

do not even know that the CONCACAF Gold Cup will be taking place right there in

career if all his peers will look at him as less of an athlete because he is 
not playing a &quot;true AMERICAN sport&quot;?</p>

<p>Soccer IS a game for sissies. The players get tripped, fall dramatically 
then stay on the ground until they are carried off after almost every play. 
American football is a collision sport yet does no have nearly as many 
&quot;stretcher&quot; cases.</p> 
<p>The &quot;fathom&quot; fouls abound. The &quot;floppers&quot; get rewarded.
</p> 
<p>If play is stopped for an &quot;injury&quot; the player should be required 
to stay off the turf for 2 minutes (after all they ARE hurt are they not?). If 
they are carried off on a stretcher they should be off AT LEAST 5 minutes 
(again player safety) and more likely 10. There would be a lot less flopping if 
they know they would be off for long enough to really be checked for serious 
injury (they pop right off the stretcher as it is far too often).</p> 
<p>They need to modernize the officiating. 3 officials is not enough for 22 
players on the large playing surface. (see basketball &ndash; 10 players 
&ndash; small court) (see American football &ndash; same field 6 officials...).

<p>The reason the US isn't better is due to several reasons:<br>
 (IMOHO)</p> 
<p>They need to attract foreign coaches who have very good technical nous to 
the clubs they already have.<br>
 Bradley needs to go and coach like Marcelo 
Bielsa or even Villas-Boas should be brought in.Someone who will improve the US 
on the tactical &amp; technical departments and enable them find what their 
identity is as team because I'm not sure the US team know what it is.They know 
what they have to live up to but they haven't found that identity that defines 
as a team..</p> 
<p>The US is no longer a growing nation or a neophyte,when it comes to 
football.The current FA was good in terms of getting the association to point 
where it is today but in terms of making it global powerhouse,they fall 
short.The vision needs to change if the US is to ever become a powerhouse.</p>

<p>I think Project 2010 was a success, because the USMNT is a lot better than 
what it was 10 years ago, but they need to make the next step.</p> 
<p>So, Sunil Gulati and Bob Bradley should be replaced. There is a lack of 
major talent from the US squad, but I believe both of these gentlemen are 
holding the current squad back even more. There's nothing wrong with a scrappy 
hard working team, the identity the USMNT has had for the last decade now, IMO. 
There are fundemental tactical and philisophical diffencies that accompanies 
this current administration. To move forward they need to set a new goal, and I 
don't believe that has been done.</p>

<p>I don't know much, but I blame the MLS for lack of US passion, and for two 
reasons.</p> 
<p>1) When they built the league 20 years ago, they didn't focus on already 
football-rabid towns. They tried to recreate city rivalries already in others, 
IE: New England and New York. They missed the mark by not marketing hardcore 
rivalries that already existed in cities like Seattle and Portland. As a 
result, big rivalries on TV showed empty stands and little interest. In my mind 
they're finally starting to change this with the addition of the Timbers and 
Whitecaps this year. The buzz around Portland is thick, the waiting list for 
tickets is long, and the experience for the fans is top flight.</p> 
<p>2) They tried to market the game to the soccer moms and kids, instead of to 
the rabid soccer fans that either grew up or spent time overseas, and hardcore 
supporters groups. If you look at cities like Portland, fans are coming to see 
the Army, and learning about the game. With some fans i've talked to, the 
enjoyment of watching the supporters groups has acted as a bridge to 
understanding the play on the field.</p> 
<p>I speak to this, because I am one of those people. After holding season 
tickets in the Army for 4 years. This last weekend at the Timbers/NYRB game I 
realized I was starting to understand the game when I groaned at several bad 
crosses and cheered for a goal-saving bicycle kick (albeit by the other team). 
Instead of trying to learn the chants, I was trying to juggle chanting with 
cheering for good play on the field, regardless if it yielded a goal. As I like 
to say, I came for the Army, and stayed for the Timber.</p> 
<p>I liked to think the MLS is finally getting the second bit better, but 
after the way the New England supporters group was treated in the fort last 
week, it reinforces that the marketing still has a ways to go.</p> <br>

<p>As long as American football, baseball, and basketball exist, soccer will 
never be number one in the US.</p> 
<p>And as long as MLS clubs recruit internationally for their youth academies 
instead of giving American citizens a chance, US soccer will never progress. 
Even on the youngest RBNY pre-academy teams, you can see international players 
and players from well outside NYC. And those teams are a bunch of low-class, 
red-card getting, complaining players who would not make it on another team 
&ndash; because of politics they make the team.</p> 
<p>I agree that the people in charge are stagnating US soccer, and Sunil and 
Bob should go as they have overstayed their welcome. US youth soccer is going 
the wrong way fast, and the only way to improve is to start up residential 
academies for all MLS clubs, and pick players based on other factors than size

<p>The problem isn't money (e.g: Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, even some good 
African teams like Ivory Coast), nor is it population (e.g: England, France, 
Germany, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands). The problem is the mentality, is to get 
the children to dream of playing soccer, finding teammates, the infrastructure, 
local clubs who will take in those children and train them, see them as an 
investment, to later sell them. In Brazil and in Europe, you will see players 
being reared from a young age, from a small club, to bigger clubs etc... They 
have to be interested, and they need to understand there is a possible career 
in the game for them. There is no formula, no &quot;we need money and 
people&quot;. It's just that people need to understand there is a future. 
Americans need to understand that SOCCER (or FOOTBALL), is the world sport, not 
baseball, not basketball, not volleyball, not American Football.</p> <br>

<p>Awful 'journalism' football has many fans in the US especially after thier 
good showing in the world cup. Many countries try for years and don't get past 
the first round or even get to play in the world cup at all. Mr. Pinto does not 
understand this game and therefore should not comment on what he does not know. 
Spain planned for years with their investment in youth football before winning 
the world cup. The US is not going to walk in and win, it takes an investment 
in the future with youth soccer which is being done now in order to have any 
success. You cant measure success only by winning the world cup because you 
will always be a failure. this sport has taken hold finally because of the 
efforts of the last team to play in the world cup with that last minute win to 
qualify for the next round. The US viewers which were in record numbers finally 
f felt that passion for the game and what it is all about. This blog was just a 
sad display of a lazy, biased and misinformed article.</p> <br>

<p>Coaching, first. MLS farm system, second. Bradley must go. Professional 
system must link with youth system and create a viable farm system.</p> 
<p>Americans play on groomed, immaculate fields and play without passion or 
creativity. We teach kids a civil game, where the boundaries of pushing, 
pulling, grabbing is not tolerated at the younger levels. We need a new brand 
of football that is more urgent, agile and ruff and tumble. We need a brand 
that looks like the streets and is not overly sanitized. It needs to be more 
earthy and authentic to life.</p> 
<p>Sport mimic's life, drama and all, when played well: American football does 
not.</p> <br>

<p>Pedro,</p> 
<p>Terrible shallow article! I hope you have an alternate career path.</p> <br>

<p>I'm from Brazil and I always questioned myself about this. USA is great at 
all other sports, but never did much at soccer.</p> 
<p>Things changed, however. I was in South Africa last year, and the biggest 
crowd I saw in Cape Town was the americans, even more than the english!</p> 
<p>I would ask them &quot;seriously, do you really like soccer?&quot; They 
would shout yes, everyone was very excited.</p> 
<p>Soccer is the most international sport, the most passionated, the most 
exciting. It's not coincidence that almost everywhere on Easth millions love 
it. Different races, different ethnicities, different colours, different 
languages, different cultures.</p> 
<p>USA is way better than it was 10 years ago. WAY BETTER. Was considered a 
good team last WC, and in the women's is one of the best. Things don't change 
that much in a short time. It takes a long period. But I think you'll get 
there. Once you show some results and there is media covering it, people will 
enjoy it. And support. And then you go.</p> 
<p>Cheers from Brazil!</p> <br>

<p>I think SteveKatherman has it right. If you are an up-and-coming athlete, 
there is no &quot;big money&quot; to be had pursuing a career in soccer, unless 
you are amazing enough to be scouted by the premier European teams with unreal 
bank accounts. I bet a ton of wide receivers and centerfielders would have made 
great soccer players but they had to make a choice and there is simply no money 
to be made playing US soccer because of the lack of commercial breaks and 
sponsorship opportunities. It's a shame too, because it is such a beautiful, 
pure sport.</p> <br>

<p>Yes, but first of all, you should know much more about it. For instance 
that Corinthians is the biggest soccer club in Brazil and has more than 33 
million fans only inside the country and many others around the world. We've 
had many brazilian soccer idols playing for the team such as Ronaldo, Rivellino 
and Socrates and nowadays we're trying to bring back Carlos Tevez who played 
for Corithians during 2005 season and also we have Adriano. Corinthians is one 
of the 3 biggest clubs in the world that earns more money from the sponsors. 
Yes you should learn more and not say or publish things that you don't know. 
Manchester City is not even one tenth of what Corinthians is.<br>
 Corinthians 
my life, Corinthians my history, Corinthians my love....</p> <br>

<p>well, another ridiculous article form the Anglo-Saxon biased CNN, first fo 
all the question would be why Mexico and Portugal are not yet a real force in 
world football??? , but talking about the yanks it has many possible answers.
<br> First of all, football is not only the most popular worldwide sport is 
also the most competitive, at club lever there are at least 10 leagues with a 
similar level , Serie A, Torneo AFA, Campeonato Paulista e Carioca, La Liga, 
Bundesliga, EPL, Eurodivise, Apertura Mexicano and so on......<br>
 What is 
more, nowadays the idea of the Big 4 (Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina) it 
does not correspond with the reality ( WC 1998 was the turning point), and for 
that reason you have Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Spain, England, Uruguay , 
Italy and France like powerhouses at international level , I do not think so 
honestly that USA has a real chance, think in the time that Spain has to wait 
until win their 1st World Cup.<br>
 Finally, about being a soft sport, I want 
to be a yank, brit or from any other country outside South America playing at 
the Morumbi, Bombonera, Centenario, with thousands of supporters chanting with 
fireworks, which can easily make you feel like a completely yellow.......</p>
