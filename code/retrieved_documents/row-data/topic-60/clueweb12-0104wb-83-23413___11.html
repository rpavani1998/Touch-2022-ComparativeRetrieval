<p>If there was one good thing that happened regarding Nebraska's game against 
Minnesota last Sunday, it was that Minnesota's staff came away from Lincoln, 
Nebraska blown away by their tour of theHendricks Training Complex. The Star 
Tribune had an article about it, and Tubby Smith headed back north insisting 
that the Gophers need to upgrade their facilities. I guess it's nice that they 
were impressed with the facilities because they sure weren't with the Husker 
basketball team.</p> 
<p>I suppose it's a fair trade with Minnesota. It's not like there are a lot 
of Husker football fans that would be impressed with Golden Gopher football. 
The football team has been bad for years, seeing some success under Glen Mason, 
but dropping below ground in the Tim Brewster era.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you ask, Minnesota would say they've made a commitment to having a good 
football team. Facilities are no longer the excuse they once were. Minnesota 
just built itself a shiny new stadium, and if you went to the Nebraska game 
this year, you know it's a pretty nice place to watch football. It sure as hell 
beats the old Metrodome, which was like watching football at a rest home, or 
inside a toilet, whichever comparison you like best.</p> 
<p>You might respond with wondering about the Jerry Kill hiring. He wasn't a 
name coach, a big money &quot;splash&quot; hire, but he worked his way through 
his first year despite suffering health issues and made some improvement along 
the way. Time will tell if he can turn their program around.</p> 
<p>So why didn't Minnesota spend the money on a big name hire? It may because 
they don't have it, but it may also be that nagging excuse that Minnesota is 
just a stop on the way to somewhere else, so what's the point with hiring a big 
name that's going to build something then leave in three or four years?</p> 
<p>I'd say the biggest obstacle facing Minnesota is lack of fan support. 
Gopher football fans aren't hard to find, but getting them to admit they're 
Gopher football fans is another story altogether. Minnesota has to get people 
into the mode that they're going to have some patience and let things work, but 
mostly, they're going to have to get over the fickle nature of &quot;I'll go 
when they're good enough&quot;. The real question is - &quot;What is good 
enough?&quot;. Is it good enough to be average, finishing in the middle of the 
conference all of the time, or do you expect to build a program that contends 
for conference titles? If you're goal is to be average, then, really, what's 
the point?</p> 
<p>Fan support is key. If you don't' support the team you're not going to sway 
the recruits you need to consistently have a winner. Look at Nebraska - the 
Huskers stoleLydon Murtha and Nate Swift from Minnesota largely because of the 
Lincoln Game Day environment. There is NOTHING like fan support. Minnesota 
doesn't have that, and compared to Nebraska, probably never will.</p> 
<p>If you made it this far, you're probably wondering why I'm spending all 
this time talking about Gopher football. Take everything I've just said about 
Minnesota football and apply it to Husker men's basketball.</p> 
<p>Now tell me, what is Nebraska going to do to build a winning men's 
basketball team?</p>

<h5> Husker BB </h5> 
<p>It is a similar picture, isn&rsquo;t it? What I hope is that Nebraskans 
have a slightly different mindset about success, enough to want to strive to be 
the best regardless. I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ve seen that with fans in 
seats, but when you live here, you don&rsquo;t really accept second-best for 
anything, especially when it comes to the Huskers.</p> 
<p>So that&rsquo;s my hope, that after we let the good guy Sadler go away 
after this season, we make the financial commitment to bring in someone bigger 
who will not only get the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; fanbase excited, but get better 
recruits interested as well. IF what I think about us is true, I think we can 
succeed and eventually reach a level where we are in the Top 25 year in and 
year out. I see no reason why we can&rsquo;t because I think we have that 
passion to be better, to not settle.</p> 
<p>Then again, maybe it&rsquo;s just that&hellip;hope.</p>

<h5> I dunno if there is anything systematic that needs to be done with the 
program </h5> 
<p>outside of getting a new coach. While facilities matter, all in all, we are 
just unlucky with coaches and well, we were spoiled with Nee and didn&rsquo;t 
realize how good we did have it. Not too many programs fire their most 
successful coach in their program&rsquo;s history, outside of a major scandal. 
And while fan support matters, its really up to the coach to give fan a reason 
to cheer. Because what we have with football is pretty unique and something a 
program really can never expect, for honestly, I think we accept alot of crap 
from our fb program. Poor non-conference schedules, poor teams with Cahallan 
and Solich, and we still attend and watch. We are incredibly inelastic when it 
comes to quality.</p>

<h5> Minnesota's too stupid to do the obvious </h5> 
<p>The Nebraska/Wisconsin football model (though Nebraska had gotten away from 
this a bit, now coming back). Develop good, homegrown linemen and go to the 
coasts and cities to get your speed and skill.</p> 
<p>They had limited success with this with Mason (Nebraska may remember from 
similar success at Kansas), but instead of allowing Mason to build on this, 
they fire him. This speaks a bit to fan apathy, but in a large metropolitan 
city where the professional teams are enjoying a measure of success, it&rsquo;s 
to be expected. Can&rsquo;t sell 7-5, 8-4, 9-3 when the Twins are challenging 
in the central and the Vike&rsquo;s are competing for NFC titles, even though 
the Gopher&rsquo;s seasons are laying a foundation for future success.</p>

<h5> We're working on it. </h5> 
<p>But&hellip;there&rsquo;s one spectacular flaw here. Mason couldn&rsquo;t 
spell &ldquo;Defense&rdquo;, and I hear that it&rsquo;s an important part of 
the game.</p> 
<p>Everyone fails. The successful learn from their failures. I just wish we'd 
quit giving ourselves so many learning opportunities.</p>

<h5> It all comes down to fan apathy </h5> 
<p>Nebrasketball and Gopher football are very similar. Neither have been much 
good in the last 50 years, which leaves very few people currently alive to 
agitate for a return to the good old days (although I don&rsquo;t think any 
such days ever existed for Husker basketball). The apathy created by long term 
suckage in these sports is only compounded by the presence of Huskers and 
Vikings football. It is in these programs that the fan bases of the programs in 
question place their true passion, and because Husker and Vikings football are 
generally successful enterprises, they&rsquo;re willing to put up with a 
substandard product in their secondary rooting interests.</p> 
<p>For Husker basketball, I think this switch over to the Haymarket Arena is a 
reasonably good chance to get people invested (they&rsquo;re already 
financially invested since the good people of Lincoln voted to raise taxes on 
everyone visiting the city to pay for it), but I do think its a fairly narrow 
window. I&rsquo;m not suggesting a particular plan of action, but I do think 
that if we&rsquo;re still in a rut in 5 years, we&rsquo;re probably going to 
stay there.</p> 
<p>&quot;My hardest job is to convince the people of Nebraska that 10-1 is not 
a losing season.&quot; - Tom Osborne</p>

<p>The 90&rsquo;s were decent enough with winning conference championships and 
tournaments but we&rsquo;ve been stuck in a rut the past 12 years.</p>

<h5> I guess with the Minnesota/Nebrasketball analogy </h5> 
<p>it&rsquo;s beneficial for us that our problem is in basketball and not 
football. With basketball you are only starting 5 players and with one or two 
really good recruits/players you can easily build a good run and progress from 
there.</p>

<h5> I don't care. </h5> 
<p>In my five years as a college student, the last four at Good Ol&rsquo; 
Nebraska U, I attended one basketball game . . . when I was a freshman at U of 
Montana and came back to visit my parents over Christmas break and the Griz 
played in Devaney against the Cornhuskers. Other than that, I never had an 
ambition to walk the half mile to watch them play. Apathy? I guess so. But then 
again, I hate watching my daughter play basketball and she&rsquo;s pretty good. 
The game sucks from my perspective. What watch it unless you want to see if 
your bracket choices are right and you have a chance to win a pretty good sum 
of cash in November. Nebraska still plays basketball? I didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>

<h5> let's be honest </h5> 
<p>when we were there, it was Moe Iba, and the place was a morgue. A MORGUE. I 
remember standing up and screaming at Bill Jackman during a game, and the 
entire place looked at me as if I were some sort of deranged nutball.</p> 
<p>Now at least the students look like they&rsquo;re having fun crappy team or 
not.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;d have gone more were that the case then.</p>

<h5> Shoes! </h5> 
<p>and free throws are, sad to say, the two memories I have of Nebraska 
basketball during that time&hellip;.the shoes were tossed when Jerry Shoecraft 
decided to make a good play and Jack Moore&rsquo;s free throws were always a 
work of art to behold. BTW, Danny Nee&rsquo;s previous stop, here at good 
ol&rsquo; Ohio U, still hasn&rsquo;t fully recovered from his departure either. 
A run of pretty good teams and a couple of NBA draft picks from his successor, 
but then he was fired for not being astoundingly, as opposed to consistently, 
successful. Hmmm, maybe we fans are a little demanding?</p>

<h5> Anything other than Nebraska Football? </h5> 
<p>Aside from baseball which has a decent following&hellip;does anyone in 
nebraska care about any other sports? (theoretical)<br>
 I spent the better 
part, lol, of 3 years in lincoln and in my experience the answer is, other than 
the athlethes of other sports and their friends, no.</p>

<h5> that's true. </h5> 
<p>I guess what i&rsquo;m saying is that if men&rsquo;s basketball is to 
change, that attitude has to change. and if that&rsquo;s true, how do you 
change it?</p> 
<p>or do you just say the hell with it, and don&rsquo;t give a flying shit 
that Nebrasketball is horrid, possibly the worst team in the Big Ten 
conference? We can&rsquo;t really get rid of the men&rsquo;s team, given that 
it makes money and that funds other sports that don&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, why the hell did Lincoln just spend the money 
to build a new stadium? Why bother?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be rude, but it&rsquo;s a standard to say no one 
cares. Put yourself in charge &ndash; how do you do it?</p>
