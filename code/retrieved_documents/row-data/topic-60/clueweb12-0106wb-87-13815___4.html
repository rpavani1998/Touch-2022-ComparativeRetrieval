<h1>Why It Matters That Mark Fox's Georgia Bulldogs Made the NCAA Basketball 
Tournament&nbsp;Field</h1>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you, but I haven&rsquo;t watched one 
minute of college basketball (other than accidentally) since the end ofFriday 
afternoon&rsquo;s disastrous collapse by the Georgia Bulldogs against the 
Alabama Crimson Tide. Nevertheless, I am positively thrilled that the Fox 
Hounds snagged the ten seed in the East Region against theWashington Huskies.
</p> 
<p>Here are five reasons why making the field of 68, even if only by the skin 
of their collective teeth, was tremendously important for the Red and Black:</p>
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>It helps a team to build up a track record of attending the tournament. 
Research has shown thatteams with established histories of making the tourney 
field get the benefit of the doubt in marginal years. Bruce Pearl has built a 
program in Knoxville that perennially contends, which earned theTennessee 
Volunteers a nine seed despite a .500 regular season conference record and 14 
total losses. The more banners a program can hang, even in one-and-done 
seasons, the more name recognition it will have with the selection committee in 
Marches to come.</li> 
<li>It pays the bills. Men&rsquo;s basketball is a revenue sport. While it is 
a distant second to football in cash flow generated, it is one of only two 
sports with a possibility of turning a significant profit. Relevance in 
roundball raises the revenue that makes the athletic association run.</li> 
<li>It helps in recruiting. Atlanta is a fertile field in which much 
basketball talent flourishes. With theGeorgia Tech Yellow Jackets in turmoil, 
Mark Fox is in a prime position to harvest the crop of talent emerging in our 
state&rsquo;s largest city. Moreover, as evidenced by the recruiting class Mark 
Richt landed last month, a full house in Stegeman Coliseum when uncommitted 
football prep stars pay their last-minute visits to Athens can be a powerful 
tool to use in persuading high school gridiron standouts to spend their college 
years playing in Sanford Stadium.</li> 
<li>It shows that we are, and helps to make us more, serious about basketball. 
Let&rsquo;s be frank: 20 years ago, being bad at basketball didn&rsquo;t matter 
for an SEC program. If anything, it was a bit of a badge of honor; being good 
at basketball was what theKentucky Wildcats, the Vanderbilt Commodores, and the 
ACC had to ease the pain of not being good at football. That changed when the
Arkansas Razorbacks, a football powerhouse in the Southwest Conference, joined 
the league and promptly won an NCAA championship in basketball. Shortly 
thereafter, theFlorida Gators hired Billy Donovan, and, all of a sudden, being 
serious about football and being serious about basketball ceased to be mutually 
exclusive, becoming instead a sign of seriousness about having an all-around 
first-class athletics department. It was one thing to be indifferent to 
basketball when we could snicker behind our hands at Georgia Tech, Kentucky, 
and Vanderbilt; now that Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee are serious about 
basketball, too, we have to be serious about basketball, as well.</li> 
<li>Damn it, I want us to be good at something besides  gymnastics  softball. 
Really, this one should be self-explanatory.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now that you know why this matters, please be good boys and girls, and go 
pick upyour brackets at SB Nation like MaconDawg and I told you to do.</p>

<h5> that's a pretty good 5... </h5> 
<p>we&rsquo;ll make you a hoops fanatic soon enough.</p> 
<p>http://sportsandgrits.blogspot.com/</p> 
<p> by Mr. Sanchez on  Mar 13, 2011 8:45 PM EDT reply actions &nbsp; </p> 
<h5> I've been trying all my life </h5> 
<p>to be a hoops fanatic. I love the college game&hellip;absolutely love it. 
But it has always been 2 steps forward, 3 steps back for nearly all my life. We 
moved to the area in &lsquo;73 and didn&rsquo;t have anything to cheer for 
until Durham showed up and brought in Wilkins and Fair in &rsquo;79. At that 
point ( just a few years removed from when Durham took FSU to the Finals 
against UCLA), I really thought the program would evolve&hellip;especially 
after our own Final Four run of &rsquo;83.</p> 
<p>But school (administration?) apathy doomed us. The University wasn&rsquo;t 
nearly as profitable then as it is now and they weren&rsquo;t about to sink any 
money into a program that, seemingly, no one really cared about. Kyle is 
absolutely correct about Florida (who had a worse hoops program than we did) 
blowing the doors open.</p> 
<p>2012 is loaded with in-state talent. If Fox can start keeping some of these 
kids in state, we will be a perennial tournament team. The sleeping giant was 
starting to really stir under Harrick&hellip;until that imploded. I think Fox 
is going to make us has made us relevant on the National scene. It&rsquo;ll 
only get better.</p> 
<p>&quot;If we score, we may win. If they never score, we'll never lose.&quot;

<h5> I wonder if Jan Kemp and the NCAA snooping around in the 80s hurt hoops 
more than football... </h5> 
<p>we weren&rsquo;t exactly recruiting the best and brightest when all of a 
sudden our academics came into question, and after suing the NCAA and them 
coming after us, I think a fear of don&rsquo;t let problems in hoops kills the 
whole AD and football with it, led to a huge reduction in resources for that 
sport. I may be wrong that, as I was just a young child at the time. But 
it&rsquo;s a theory.</p>

<h5> certainly </h5> 
<p>the post-Kemp scrutiny the program was under had an effect, rightly so as 
it turned out. Ultimately, Georgia Hoops was a tough sell anyway. The gym was a 
part-time stockyard, no practice facilities and there was no support for the 
program on the horizon. Hoops was always an afterthought. You cannot recruit 
under those circumstances.</p> 
<p>&quot;If we score, we may win. If they never score, we'll never lose.&quot;

<h5> We are already good at much more than softball my friend </h5> 
<p>Hunt seat equitation on the flat? Check. Bass fishing? Check. Getting 
arrested for alcohol/drivers license related offenses? Check. Poor use of 
timeout? I think you get my point.</p> 
<p>Its an embarassment of riches.</p> 
<p>That being said the strange orange ball and the hoopy thing would be nice 
additions.</p>

<h5> #3 and #4 </h5> 
<p>are my favorite reasons. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like Travis Leslie and 
Trey Thompkins as much as anybody, but we need great recruits to get where we 
would all like to see the Dawgs go.</p> 
<p>We also have good facilities. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the 
Stegesaurus for the LSU game and I think the renovations are spectacular for 
that somewhat strange, dome of a building, that we call Stegeman Coliseum. The 
addition is particularly spectacular with the offices and practice facilities. 
My son preferred Tennessee&rsquo;s practice facilities because there is a wall 
that rolls up and down to allow for two practice floors when needed. But I 
digress. The facilities are still very nice.</p>

<h5> lucky dawgs </h5> 
<p>i thought if we beat alabama and showed up against uk that we might have a 
shot at a 10 seed, but after we shit in our hat, i let lunardi get to me and 
thought for sure we were out. nonetheless, i forced myself to watch the 
selection show and by god was i rewarded. what a break and i will take it.</p> 
<p>also, i live in bolder, co and teach at cu an no one here (self included) 
thought the buffs had a chance of getting snubbed after beating k-state for the 
3rd time. oh well, the hell with &rsquo;em.</p>

<h5> Howdy folks. </h5> 
<p>No hard feelings, but the Husky mascot is the big dog campared to that cute 
little bulldog you drag around on those really tiny legs . . .</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll cheerfully exchange little mascot jabs, but wish to note that 
the GA folks that have chosen to post on the UW SBNation blog havebeen both 
polite/pleasant AND willing to share about your team.</p> 
<p>In that spirit, I&rsquo;ll note that that our dawgs have had a kind of 
strange up and down season. At times the kids have played up to both talent and 
energy and we seemed to easily run away from a lot of teams, and at times we 
played flat and lost to plainly less talented teams. Until very late in our 
season we had a special ability to lose the close games.</p> 
<p>While you&rsquo;ve probably already seen it elsewhere, we like to run if 
given the chance.<br>
 All Husky Dawg fans are hoping for a track meet . . .</p>

<h5> Glad to hear your side. </h5> 
<p>More importantly, I&rsquo;m glad our folks have been amicable to your folks 
and you have responded in the same manner.</p> 
<p>I know very little about the Huskies, but I have noticed they have been a 
bit of a Jekyll and Hyde sort of team. Can you tell me if it&rsquo;s a 
situation where they have played to the level of the competition or is it just 
plain old coming out flat and staying that way?</p>

<h5> Howdy EricBDawg: Short answer: who the hell knows? </h5> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve been streaky all year. At times, especially early w/ full 
roster, the kids have come out w/ huge energy and confidence and looked like a 
contender. Just run away from teams. We&rsquo;ve also been flat as h*ll at 
times. Scoring streaks, and droughts, have also a been regular feature during 
games.</p> 
<p>I genuinely wish I knew which Husky team will show, but good news for us 
and bad for you is that we finally trended up in our conference tournament.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll wager a beer on the game, and will gladly buy if we lose . . .

<h5> Pick by mascot fight.... </h5>

<h5> I like this method... </h5> 
<p>What is a Tar Heel? Sure, their fluffy mascot is a Ram, but in reality, I 
will take a bulldog over a native North Carolinian, if a Tar Heel is just a 
nickname for someone from NC. Honestly, the match-up between a husky and a 
bulldog would be interesting (but, as Vick knows, is illegal).</p> 
<p>Go Dawgs!</p>

<h5> The low build of the bulldog would keep the Husky... </h5> 
<p>from being able to get to the more vulnerable and damaging areas to end the 
fight. Although the thick coat of the Husky can act similarly, making it 
difficult for the bulldog&rsquo;s teeth to penetrate the husky&rsquo;s skin. 
But size and tenacity, I&rsquo;ll take the bulldog.</p>

<h5> Only cause it's in a pack... </h5> 
<p>stick &lsquo;em 1 on 1 in a pen, and I&rsquo;ll take the shorter squater 
bulldog. As said, the vulnerable areas on the dog are much easier for the 
bulldog to get to on a husky than a husky to get to on a bulldog. And yes, I 
used to own a pit, but no, I&rsquo;d never dream of Vicking it.</p>
