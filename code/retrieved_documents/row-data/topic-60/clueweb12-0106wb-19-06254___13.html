<p>Louisville's Josh Bellamy grabs a touchdown over Memphis' Mohammed Seisay 
in 2010. The Tigers will be seeing a lot more of their former rival when they 
join the Big East in 2013.</p> <br>

<p><strong>ANALYSIS </strong></p> 
<p>Before news of a reported move to the Big East Conference surfaced Tuesday, 
the University of Memphis football program's future schedules -- games against 
Louisville and Miami in 2014 and Miami, Louisville, Missouri and Kansas in 2015 
-- were what excited Tiger fans most.</p> 
<h4>Poll</h4> 
<h4>Do you think, ultimately, the Big East will be better for the University 
of Memphis than Conference USA?</h4> Yes <br>
No <br>
Not sure <br>
<br>

<p>See the results &raquo;</p> 
<p>View previous polls &raquo;</p> <br>

<p>Well, those games against teams from Bowl Championship Series conferences 
and the debut next fall of new coach Justin Fuente.</p> 
<p>After Tuesday's approval by Big East presidents to offer an invitation to 
the U of M, the Tigers have another reason to celebrate. The program's 
long-awaited search for inclusion in one of the six major conferences is over, 
with the Tigers set to begin Big East play in 2013.</p> 
<p>And what will that mean to a struggling football program, one that has 
dropped 31 of its past 36 games and hasn't had a winning season since 2007?</p> 
<p>Fuente's second recruiting class should be better than his first. Average 
attendance, which has hovered around the 20,000 mark, should spike, as well. 
Annual payouts to Big East football members could approach $4 million in 2013, 
more than double what the U of M receives annually as a member of Conference 
USA, according to Boise State president Bob Kustra. Boise State joins the Big 
East in 2013 (football only).</p> 
<p>Tuesday's news represents one of the most significant moments in Tiger 
football history, giving the U of M a better opportunity to compete with the 
Southeastern Conference for talent in the region. Memphis still won't be on 
equal footing with the SEC programs it recruits against, but would Ridgeway 
standout and Georgia signee Sheldon Dawson have honored his commitment to the U 
of M had the Tigers been in the Big East?</p> 
<p>Memphis officials are remaining mum until today's noon news conference 
announcing the move. Others offered mixed reviews on what the Big East 
affiliation will mean to the football program.</p> 
<p>''Now Justin Fuente will be able to walk into a kid's living room and say, 
'We can compete for a national championship,''' said Mike Fredi, president of 
the Highland Hundred, the U of M's football booster group. ''He couldn't say 
that before.''</p> 
<p>The Tigers will be joining a Big East that is losing Pittsburgh and 
Syracuse to the Atlantic Coast Conference and West Virginia to the Big 12. The 
league's footprint will stretch from California to Connecticut.</p> 
<p>''This is not the Big East Memphis has dreamed of getting into for 
decades,'' saidDennis Dodd, national college football columnist for 
CBSSports.com. ''It is a marginal step up.''</p> 
<p>Dodd said Big East football for 2013 -- Memphis, Cincinnati, Louisville, 
Houston, SMU, Central Florida, South Florida, Boise State, San Diego State, 
UConn and Rutgers -- will have a C-USA familiarity and lack marketability. 
Seven of the 11 (all but Boise, SDSU, Rutgers and UConn) are former C-USA 
members. Navy joins as a football-only member in 2015.</p> 
<p>''I was told the addition of Pittsburgh and Syracuse alone to the ACC is 
worth more than what the new Big East will be worth in football,'' Dodd said. 
''The theory is ESPN is not going to be interested because (the Big East) said 
no to them when they offered them $1 billion in their old form.''</p> 
<p>A founding member of Conference USA in the mid-1990s, the U of M will 
benefit by having its basketball in arguably the nation's strongest conference. 
But despite a possibly de-valued television contract, the Big East will elevate 
U of M football by uniting it with perennial national power Boise State, along 
with solid programs at Cincinnati, Louisville and South Florida.</p> 
<p>''This is only going to help Fuente,'' Fredi said. </p> 
<p>There's the tricky matter of automatic qualifier status for college 
football's Bowl Championship Series too. Under the current BCS contract, each 
one of six conferences -- including the Big East -- received an automatic bid 
for its champion to play in one of the most lucrative bowls. With that comes a 
significant share of cash.</p> 
<p>But many observers believe the automatic qualifier status will disappear 
after the current BCS contract expires in 2013, meaning that the long-coveted 
status as one of college football's big boys may lose much of its meaning by 
the time the Tigers join. It's unclear what the BCS' revenue structure would be 
in its new contract.</p>

Now here is my question, and for the life of my I 
can't understand why the CA didn't have an explanation or a small story 
explaining this, what are the guidelines that are used to allow a conference to 
remain AQ or to loose it's AQ status? Why would the newly re-formed Big East 
lose that status?</p> <br>

<p>did Cincy have Marketability when they first joined? no they were terrible,

Memphis is in the BE because of their commitment

Houston, SMU, UCF and now Memphis. COMMITMENT TO FOOTBALL + BCS money = Better

<p>Also, alot of people who are predicting BCS auto qualifier will be pulled 
from the BE, wait and see. BE wasnt always a powerhouse in Football! CUSA is a 
pretty decent conference for football and baseball, so people naturally judge 
CUSA by Basketball which has been a one horse race primarily for the last 
decade... they plucked the best programs for football, and The BE may be a 
fairly well balanced, solid football conference going forward!</p> <br>

<p>Really? Maybe it would be wise to wait until a Big East team actually wins 
a National Championship before we start talking about Memphis competing for a 
National Championship. The Big East has had two teams play in the championship 
game, Miami and West Virginia. Neither of them are now in the conference. No 
current Big East team has ever won a BCS Championship game.</p> <br>

<p>It has nothing to do with the Big East losing AQ status. What is happening 
is that there will be no AQ status for any conference, with the idea being that 
3 SEC schools or 3 Big10 schools could now make the BCS. Under this system the 
Big East, the ACC, or any other conference will face not having a team in the 
BCS if their best team(s) are not highly ranked. I'm not sure what that does to 
Conference Championship games, although it could make them irrelevent.</p> <br>

<p>Not sure if you mean &quot;C-USA today&quot; or C-USA after Houston, SMU, 
and Cenral Florida are gone? Yes, the Big East in football will look a lot like 
C-USA 10 years ago. But, C-USA 10 years ago was a heck of a conference and was 
rising fast.</p> <br>
