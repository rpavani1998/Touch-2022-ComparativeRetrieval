<p>If, as a youth baseball coach, you would rather have fun, structured, 
fast&#8208;moving practices loaded with fundamentals, then this book is for 
you. As you enter a new baseball season, three things are certain; your players 
will be diverse in their skills and understanding of the game, there is great 
deal your players will need to learn, and finally, you will have a limited 
amount of time to prepare for each practice, as well as a limited amount of 
time during practice.</p>
