<p>Yes, I included basketball that is&nbsp;because&nbsp;UNLV is taking on the 
North Carolina who are the No. 1 team in the country this evening. There are 
some other games as well in basketball, but the UNLV vs. UNC is the best game.
</p> 
<p>The game with the most tangible reward for a win is Air Force who can 
become bowl eligible if they can defeat Colorado State. The rest of the teams 
are jockeying for bowl position and Boise State is still fighting for an 
at-large bid to the BCS.</p>

<h5> Pat Hill </h5> 
<p>Will probably get one more year as head coach to see how he does in the 
MWC/CUSA. Plus I don&rsquo;t think the university can even afford to fire him.
<br> That said, much of his skill players are sophomores, including Carr and 
his #1 and #3 receiving targets. Rouse, who is in the top 10 in the nation in 
rushing, is a junior. So my ire has cooled to &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how he 
does as these players mature&rdquo;</p>

<h5> SDSU Hoops </h5> 
<p>Travels to the Thunderdome tonight to take on the UCSB Gauchos. A win 
likely means a Top 25 ranking.</p>

<h5> Well... </h5> 
<p>better than the shellacking Wyoming got last year. They kept it real 
interesting through the first half. Some nice drives in the 4th quarter as 
well. Kept positive on the turnovers as well. Some real improvement from this 
team, I like where they are heading!</p>
