<br>
 Everything you want in 
a home game.<br>
<br>
 Except a victory. <br>
<br>
 But, hey, it had to end 
sometime, right?Conference USA leader Southern Miss beat the Knights 78-65 and 
put an end to UCF's 16-game home winning streak, but maybe the end is just the 
beginning.<br>
<br>
 The beginning of a basketball tradition. <br>
<br>
 You 
would have to see it to believe it. And if you haven't seen it, you're missing 
the best sports show in town.<br>
<br>
 With all due respect to the 19,000 fans 
that traditionally fill the $500 millionAmway Center to watch their 
dysfunctionalMagic millionaires, they don't make nearly as much noise as the 
7,790 who showed up Saturday night. Maybe because the seats closest to the 
floor &mdash; in the jam-packed &quot;Knightmare&quot; section &mdash; are 
filled with rowdy students instead of buttoned-down corporate executives.<br>

<br> And the best part of it all: UCF's star player &mdash; Keith Clanton 
&mdash; grew up in Orlando, loves it here and hasn't asked to be traded toUCLA. 
<br> <br>
 &quot;If Dwight Howard played in here and heard the enthusiasm we 
bring, maybe we could convince him to stay,&quot; said Brian Kruger, a senior 
in engineering speaking through the mouth hole of his banana costume.<br>
<br>
 
Try to imagine the delirium in the Amway Center if Dwight stood on top of the 
scorer's table after the Magic beat the Lakers, thrusting his fists in the air 
and screaming euphorically as fans poured onto the floor in one mass mob of 
madness.<br>
<br>
 That's what happened last week at UCF when Coach Donnie 
Jones' Knights beatMemphis for the first time in school history and center Josh 
Crittle climbed up on the scorer's table as UCF fans rushed down from the 
stands.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Ah, man, what an incredible feeling standing up there 
(on the scorer's table), seeing the crowd and taking in the atmosphere,&quot; 
Crittle said. &quot;It was something I'll remember forever. At that moment, I 
felt like I was on top of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
 UCF's average attendance 
(5,379) is nearly double that of futureBig East rival USF (2,872). Not only 
that, but the Knights average about 1,500 more fans per game than theMiami 
Hurricanes. Ask yourself this: In what other sport can UCF outdraw a more 
established state program like 23rd-rankedFlorida State? Even though the 'Noles 
are leading theACC and averaging more fans than UCF, they've only had one crowd 
this year bigger than the 8,700 fans who showed up at theUCF Arena for the 
Memphis game.<br>
<br>
 Not saying there's as much interest in UCF basketball 
as there is FSU basketball, but the Knights are at least in the conversation.
<br> <br>
 The UCF crowds for games against Memphis and Houston have even 
surpassed some early-season crowds at basketball powerhouse Florida.<br>
<br>
 
Seriously, could you imagine UCF's football program on any given Saturday ever 
outdrawing Florida or Florida State?<br>
<br>
 Not a chance. <br>
<br>
 Which 
just goes to show how relatively easy it would be to turn UCF into a basketball 
school.<br>
<br>
 Turning Florida, Florida State and Miami into basketball 
schools would be impossible. There's too much football history, heritage, 
tradition and titles for fans to change their habits. But at UCF, there is none 
of that. Sure, there have been pockets of football success under current coach
George O'Leary and former quarterback Daunte Culpepper, but never sustained 
excellence.<br>
<br>
 UCF's athletic program is a blank canvas with fans 
hungering for a masterpiece to be unveiled in football or basketball. And let's 
face it, it's much easier for an off-Broadway program like UCF to join the 
basketball elite than it is in football. Ask Gonzaga. Ask Butler. Ask Memphis.
<br> <br>
 &quot;We want to help start a tradition,&quot; said Kruger, speaking 
again through the mouth hole of his bright yellow costume.<br>
<br>
 Even in 
defeat, UCF students are going bananas over basketball.<br>
<br>
 Literally.

<p>1. At its heart, UCF is still very much Florida Tech. The College of 
Engineering and Computer Science at UCF is the best in the state. And besides, 
how does attempting to develop athletics have anything to do with reducing 
academics?</p> 
<p>2. Regarding ease of development, there is no doubt basketball is easier to 
develop than football. Century long football traditions (that continued to 
develop) are incomparable to 10-20 year traditions. Add the bandwagon effect 
(which is quite large) to these football giants which adds to mass amounts of 
money already, UCF will need at least a decade to even have a chance-chance 
meaning top 20 name recognition and the benefits that come with it. Player 
development is high however, as UCF turns under radar recruits into impact NFL 
players as good or better than most.</p> 
<p>3. Both football and basketball are improving but under the radar sports 
such a baseball, track and field, soccer are the easiest to impact as we are 
seeing.</p> 
<p>4. UCF is both a football school and basketball school. You cannot 
differentiate between the two. Basketball is somewhat easier to develop and 
compete but football draws more natural support and is huge regarding tv 
revenues.</p> <b>CoachHater</b> at 12:15 PM January 30, 2012 
<p>Since BeDonkeyis a relative new comer to Orlando, let's give a little 
backgrond. UCF was originally a basketball only school. Football 
didn't&nbsp;exist at UCF&nbsp;until 1979. It's took almost a decade before UCF 
football attracted enough attention that people started to say that the 
university as a &quot;football&quot; school.</p> 
<p>Basketball has been played at UCF since 1969, the year after 
the&nbsp;university began holding classes. The first basketball game was played 
before the school had even decided if the athletic teams should be called the 
Knights or the Citronauts. UCF has been to the NCAA tournament four times as a 
Division I school and six times as a Division II school.</p> 
<p>The new arena has certainly contributed to the excitement. However, on the 
night of which you write attendance was less than 8,000. The largest basketball 
crowd ever was 9.825, back in 2009. The arena only holds a maximum of 10,000. 
By contrast, the average crowd at Rupp Arena, in Lexington, is around 23,000. 
Future Big East&nbsp;opponent Louisville, averages 21,000 per game. UCF a 
basketball school? Mikey, I think we'll need to add some seats before we 
competes.</p> 
<p>As usual. This is just BeDonkey stirring the pot and jumping, ever so 
briefly, on the UCF bandwagon. Next week, after they fall to a nobody school 
like Palm Beach Atlantic, Mike will jump off the bandwagon, trash the school 
and berate the fans.</p> <b>LandOfLibtardia</b> at 6:01 AM January 30, 2012 
<p>If only the locals were as excited about the students' academic prospects, 
not just sports. UCF, The Harvard of East Orlando.</p> <br>
