<p>Officials from what&rsquo;s left of the Big East&rsquo;s dwindling football 
membership had another conference call on Tuesday morning and there remains no 
specific timetable on adding UCF, but &ldquo;appears an invitation is 
forthcoming&rdquo; for the Knights, the league&rsquo;s No. 1 target.</p> 
<p>The presidents, chancellors and athletic directors continued to discuss 
potential expansion candidates. Among those mentioned were UCF, Air Force, 
Navy, Temple, Houston, SMU and Boise State, a league source told CBSSports.com.
</p> 
<p>While Commissioner John Marinatto said in a statement Monday the league 
would consider a model with 12 football members, part of Tuesday&rsquo;s call 
was discussing the possibility of splitting the football and basketball 
conference into divisions, once the football side is replenished.</p> 
<p>Navy, Air Force and Boise State are being considered as football members 
only, while UCF, Temple, Houston and SMU are at the top of the list as 
all-sports members so it&rsquo;s unknown right now how large the basketball 
membership could grow.</p> 
<p>The Newark Star-Ledger reported one proposed alignment discussed at 
Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting consisted of Rutgers, UConn, South Florida, UCF, Temple 
and Navy in an East Division with West Virginia, Louisville, Cincinnati, Air 
Force, SMU and Houston in a West Division.</p> 
<p>However, there remains the very real possibility Louisville and West 
Virginia may not be in the league and bound for the Big 12 if Missouri leaves 
for the SEC or the Big 12 expands to 12 teams.</p> 
<p>What make Temple, SMU and Houston attractive to the Big East, one source 
said, is their respective television markets. Philadelphia (Temple) is the 
nation&rsquo;s No. 4 market, Dallas (SMU) is No. 5 and Houston is No. 10.</p> 
<p>Beyond Navy, Air Force and UCF, a league source said &ldquo;no one team is 
definitely next&rdquo; as an expansion candidate.</p> 
<p>There also appears to be conflicting opinions on pursuing Boise State. Some 
league members support adding Boise State because of the Broncos&rsquo; recent 
success, which would help the league with its future BCS status. However, 
others believe Boise State, located nearly 700 miles west of Air Force and 
nearly 2,200 miles from Tampa/USF, is simply too far to consider.</p> 
<p>Boise State president Bob Kustra said in a statement Monday that the 
Broncos &ldquo;are looking forward to their inaugural season&rdquo; in the 
Mountain West Conference and he &ldquo;has great confidence in the future 
direction of the Mountain West.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with 
other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus 
is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped 
make Boise State a popular and compelling national brand,&quot; Kustra said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we 
are continuing to monitor the situation.&nbsp;We are confident that Boise State 
will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status 
with the best interests of the entire university in mind.&nbsp;Boise 
State&rsquo;s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, 
popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely 
valuable conference partner.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A league source also told CBSSports.com that Army is no longer being 
considered as a candidate by the Big East. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been honest 
with us and that they&rsquo;re not interested because of the challenges they 
had previously in Conference USA,&rdquo; the source said.</p> 
<p>Army was in C-USA from 1998-2004. The Cadets were 9-41 in C-USA play and 
finished last in the league five of the seven seasons.</p>

<blockquote> I agree that ECU has not been productive against the ACC schools 
but ECU does fit the BEast profile.</blockquote> <br>
 clab4tune, I was 
responding sarcastically to an emotional, hateful, unprovoked&nbsp;post against 
the ACC and the North Carolina schools.&nbsp; ECU is not an easy&nbsp;W.&nbsp; 
Their record this year hasn't been helped by their schedule.&nbsp; A lot of 
teams would be 1-4 after playing South Carolina, Virginia Tech, North Carolina 
and Houston. &nbsp;I agree they could&nbsp;be a good addition for the Big 
East.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
Not trying to be a smart... but because of the impact 
of TV on college athletics, your conference idea, while encouraging rivalries, 
would&nbsp;actually&nbsp;demote all those schools to the level of App St rather 
than elevate App St.&nbsp; The TV&nbsp;market of N Carolina, S Carolina, 
Virginia, W Virginia and Maryland&nbsp;would be smaller than the Southern 
Conference market of N Carolina, S Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and 
Alabama.&nbsp; They'd never do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;n<br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  It is my feeling after 
the BIG EAST Officials and Presidents make the final&nbsp;decision to add 6 
more schools, EAST CAROLINA will be invited to the conference.&nbsp; East 
Carolina would be a great choice for the BE, and definitely an asset to the 
league.&nbsp;ECU has a very nice stadium, great sports fans, and a very 
convienient location for Big East fans. You can ask any ACC school that plays 
ECU, and they will tell you that ECU is ready to play you in football anytime, 
home or away.&nbsp; To me, it would be a huge&nbsp;mistake for the BE&nbsp;to 
pass over ECU. NOTE: I am not an ECU fan,&nbsp; But I respect their program, 
fans and great facilities. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  If this happens instead 
of just letting the BEast die as it should.....all I can say is people better 
lay off the Big 10 for their name being inaccurate because there is NOTHING 
east about Air Force, SMU, Houston, and Boise.&nbsp; Why not just take the 
refguees from the dead BEast and add them to the &quot;new&quot; 
MWC......semantics. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  I agree that ECU has not 
been productive against the ACC schools but ECU does fit the BEast profile. And 
all-time against the other schools that the BEast&nbsp;is looking at ECU has 
done very well, which is what you need to look at. 1-0 vs Boise State (Again we 
had Chris Johnson that game) 8-2 vs UCF, 7-4 vs Temple, 6-4 vs Houston (Last 
one was Houston crushing ECU) 2-2 vs SMU and 0-2 Vs Navy (Again another 
crushing defeat last time). And everyone knows that ECU brings the crowds to 
Bowl Games (when&nbsp;they get into them). The ACC does not need another North 
Carolina Team thus why they got Pitt and SYC. But ECU (Just like any other 
team) would get better because of the BEast Rep. in sports kids would want to 
play against the Uconns, WVU, USF (ECU would love to beat them because of Skip 
Hotlz).<br>
<br>
If i started a new conf. it would be centralized (Duke, NCST, 
UNC, WF, USC (Gamecocks), Clemson, Virginia, WVU, VT, ECU, App ST, Maryland) 
would be ok in all sports! and bring up App st to D1 or the FBS whatever they 
call it now. What ya think? <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Gasman, even you have to 
admit that the SEC has its up years and down years from division to 
division.&nbsp; Put WVU in the East this year and they are competing for a shot 
at the SEC Championship Game.&nbsp; Put them in the West in the early-mid 
2000's and they are competing for a shot at the SEC Championship Game.&nbsp; On 
a consistency basis, I would say that WVU is like UGA or Arkansas.&nbsp; That 
is a pretty respectable place to be in the SEC.&nbsp; So to throw out the term 
&quot;average at best&quot; is pretty irresponsible.<br>
<br>
That's why fans 
aren't making these decisions.<br>

<br>
whoaaa 
lil buddy!<br>
<br>
You don't understand too much about LSU football, do you?? 
<br> <br>
1- LSU's defense is built on bend don't break and let the other team 
hand you the game<br>
<br>
2- THINK! WVa (according to ABC commentators) 
averaged 50% conversion of possessions into TD's&nbsp; so LSU's goal was to pin 
them back and make them work.&nbsp; I know we punted to WVA 6 times and the 
average start on those 6 possessions was the 10.&nbsp; So WVa would have to 
drive 90 yards 6 times and assuming 50% conversion that is 21 points and 270 
yards.&nbsp; HMM! that seems to have been the case<br>
<br>
3- THINK! LSU is #2 
in forced turnovers for the NCAA.&nbsp; think 6 long drives produces any 
turnovers?&nbsp; OOPS 2 TO's led to 14 points<br>
<br>
4-&nbsp; Think! LSU has 
the #2 offensive efficiency in the SEC.&nbsp; (that means they score a lot of 
points per drive)&nbsp; LSU had 7 TD's vs WVA&nbsp; 2 were direct result of 
turnover one was at the 1 yard line&nbsp;and a punt return.&nbsp; So 5 
offensive TD's.&nbsp; their average drive was 60 yards.<br>
<br>
<br>
with that 
said<br>
<br>
1- WVA scored 3 td's on 16 possessions&nbsp; 19%&nbsp; oops a bit 
off their 50% ave<br>
<br>
2- WVA had 533 total yards, 270 resulted in 
points&nbsp; 263 didnt&nbsp; (do you really want to brag about all those 
worthless yards??)<br>
<br>
3-&nbsp; LSU &quot;only&quot; had 360 yds, BUT 300 
yards produced 33 points, only 60 yards produced nothing...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (actually 1 td from 1 yard, so 59 produced nothing)<br>
<br>ARE YOU BEGINNING TO SEE THE DOMINATION? <br>

<blockquote> the BE MUST take ECU as well that would be good for the 
conference to get a school in NCarolina that actually cares about football and 
doesn't have to answer to tobacco road, and the BigEast can give the ACC a lil 
&quot;take that&quot; in their own front yard.</blockquote> Yeah 
GoldRusher,&nbsp; that would really be a crushing blow to the ACC.&nbsp; Just 
imagine them taking&nbsp;what Sagarin rates the 6th best team in North Carolina 
behind UNC, Wake Forest, Duke, NC State and Appalachian State.&nbsp; They have 
losing records all time against all of those but perennial football power Duke, 
which is 5-5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think, what if any other team in North Carolina 
cared about football.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brilliant idea, I'm sure the Big East will 
jump right on it(sarcasm, if it's not obvious).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
How about 
telling us what it means to &quot; have to answer to tobacco 
road&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you give an example?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Wow! Let me think. East 
Carolina has won 2 of the last 3 CUSA football championships, is NC's second 
largest university, has a basketball team that is getting better, a 
consistently good baseball team, CUSA titles in other sports, packs 50,000+ in 
the football stadium on a dreary day with a down year team, is a foothold in a 
state with 4 ACC schools, has a fan base across the state, is actually in the 
eastern US, and there is not much mention here about them.<br>
<br>
If the 
powers that be in the Big East can't see this diamond in the rough, then they 
are certainly the epitome of &quot;can't see the forest for the trees&quot;!

<blockquote> 
<p>I simply pointed out that your 'stats' were no big deal and irrelevant.</p> 
</blockquote> Irrelevant?&nbsp; Because WVU didn't win?&nbsp; You are the one 
who claimed WVU would get killed in the SEC.&nbsp; If WVU could amass those 
kind of stats against the best of the SEC, what would they do against the other 
teams?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>

<blockquote> I said it's because WVU threw as much as 3 SEC schools vs 
LSU.&nbsp; Looks like a wash to me.<br>
To make all those attempts means you 
have no running game (or at least that night....and you're behind in the 
scoreboard)...all night.<br>
<br>
<br>
</blockquote> <br>
Every team LSU has 
played&nbsp;from behind.&nbsp; Yet none of these teams accomplished in points 
or passing yards or total yards what WVU produced.&nbsp; Who cares if WVU got 
their yards through the air?&nbsp; LSU didn't give up those kind of numbers to 
any other SEC team.... right?<br>
<br>
In the end, WVU lost.&nbsp; But, for you
