<strong>Revisiting Kings and Barons both Football and 
Basketball</strong> <br>
 Every once in a while I like to re-visit the topic of 
Kings and Barons (as Mandel calls them) in football. And this time I would like 
to add a separate listing of Kings and Barons in basketball as well. For the 
latter I am not including non-FBS playing members suchas Georgetown, Villanova, 
and Marquette which would all be at least Baron status.<br>
<br>
Football <br>

<br> Kings: Alabama, Florida, Florida State, Louisiana State, Miami, Michigan, 
Nebraska, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Penn State, Southern Cal, Texas<br>

<br> Barons: Arkansas, Auburn, Clemson, Colorado, Georgia, Georgia Tech, 
Oregon, Tennessee, Texas A&amp;M, UCLA, Virginia Tech, West Virginia, Wisconsin
<br> <br>
Basketball <br>
<br>
Kings: Arizona, Connecticut, Duke, Florida, 
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina, Ohio 
State, Syracuse, UCLA<br>
<br>
Barons: Arkansas, Cincinnati, Illinois, 
Maryland, Memphis, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina State, Notre Dame, 
Oklahoma State, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, 
Wisconsin<br>
<br>
 I'm sure the above is not a perfect listing, but I believe 
that it is a solid enough listing that it might give us an insight into how 
each conference is viewed.<br>
<br>
 It also gives us insight into why the 
conferences not named the SEC and the BiG have targeted who they have targeted 
for any remaining expansion.<br>
<br>
 The Pac-12 - Texas and Oklahoma <br>
 
The ACC - Notre Dame<br>
 The Big 12 - Florida State and Clemson <br>
<br>
 
Ultimately, for the ACC (since this is an ACC board), the league truly needs 
FSU and Miami to get back to being Kings on the field as well as off the field. 
Should that happen the conference will be fine.<br>
<br>
 Cheers, <br>

<strong>RE: Revisiting Kings and Barons

 Nice thread. Just some opinions 
&amp; observations:<br>
<br>
Football: <br>
 * I'd have to say that if FSU 
&amp; Miami are still football kings that you have to include Georgia as well.
<br> * Several ACC teams were once Kings but have fallen to baron (Clemson 
&amp; Ga Tech) or lower (Pittsburgh).<br>
 * N. Carolina &amp; N.C. State have 
both flirted with baron status in the past but don't make the grade now.<br>

<br> Basketball: <br>
 * Looks about right. Maybe add Georgetown to the barons 
list.<br>
 * Sadly, it wasn't that long that Ga Tech was a baron on the way to 
king status. Where are ye', Bobby Cremins? <br>

 Interesting 
isn't it that the PAC 12 and the SEC are targeting the same two schools, and 
that the B1G is targeting the same school as the ACC.<br>
<br>
 The Big XII has 
no place to go if either the SEC or the PAC 12 are successful. The ACC on the 
otherhand is well positioned as a 12 team league if FSU or Clemson (or both) 
were to leave. A 12 team ACC might be more attractive to Notre Dame.

<strong>RE: Revisiting Kings and

 Neil, <br>

 I generally 
agree with your listing and I agree with HM that a few others have left their 
former glory for lower status (Pitt, Syracuse). I am more hopeful that the ACC 
is rising with FSU looking better every year, Syracuse actually playing 
competitive football again. The listing you have, especially below the Kings, 
is very fluid and can change in a couple of short years.<br>
<br>
 As to the 
target schools, you might be able to expand that to include potential 16 team 
leagues:<br>
<br>
 PAC 12: Texas, Oklahoma, tag-alongs accepted as long as 
Texas is in the package<br>
 ACC: Notre Dame, pick-em <br>
 Big 12: Florida 
State, Clemsonm Louisville, Cincy, AFA, BYU<br>
 SEC: Florida State, Clemson, 
WVU, Oklahoma, Texas<br>
 B1G: Notre Dame, pick-em (as long as academics are 
respectable)<br>
<br>
 Both the PAC 12, B1G and the ACC are more limited by 
geography, though this limitation is self imposed by the respective conference. 
The Big 12 and the SEC are more willing to go beyond what would be considered 
their &quot;region&quot;. The B1G did flirt with Texas but rejected any 
tag-alongs that would tarnish their academic image (OU, TTech, and/or OSU). <br>

 While I agree the Barons are more fluid than the Kings, I 
think it's still relatively stable as well. As with the Kings, it is easier for 
a former Baron to be elevated back to Baron status than it is to become a Baron 
for the first time.<br>
<br>
 So Georgia, if it were to go on a hot streak for 
5-7 years and win another NC they would quickly be elevated back to King (if 
they aren't a King already), but Oregon would need probably two decades or more 
at their current level with at least 2 NCs to reach King level.<br>
<br>
 Pitt 
could easily be elevated from what is the Knight level back up to Baron status 
if they were to have a good 5-7 year run. While a Louisville would need to go 
two decades of consistently getting to 9-10 wins a year for them to go to the 
next level.<br>
<br>
 I think the SEC going into Texas was a natural western 
extension of their geography since that state borders both Arkansas and 
Louisiana. I see Missouri as more Big Ten country than SEC, but then it took 
the SEC some time to decide upon #14 after they couldn't persuade two other 
logical geographical extensions as takers (a team from Virginia or a team from 
North Carolina).<br>
<br>
 I think the Pac-12 desperately wants to extend 
beyond their current geography to get into both Texas and Oklahoma, moreso the 
former than the latter. It's just that the feeling isn't mutual, especially by 
Texas. And the ACC supposedly tested the waters with both Texas and Notre Dame, 
showing a willingness to go beyond their perceived geography.<br>
<br>
 Today's 
landscape pretty much ensures conferences will be looking to extend beyond 
their supposed geography of yesteryear.<br>
<br>
 As for expansion targets, I 
left the SEC and BiG out of it since they don't 'need' to expand. With one 
league having three Kings and four Barons and the other having four Kings, one 
Baron, and two Knights that could rise to Baron status in Michigan State and 
Iowa, they may choose to do so, but they don't need to.<br>
<br>
 The Pac-12, 
despite it's great TV contracts knows that it needs to expand at some point 
since they only have 1 football King. And unless UCLA finds their Pete Carroll 
that isn't changing in a hurry.<br>
<br>
 The ACC and Big 12 are in similar 
situations, although the latter's two Kings are more stable than the ACC's, the 
ACC's Barons are more plentiful. It's why the FSU and Clemson to the Big 12 is 
intriguing (even though I don't think it will happen). Both schools have to at 
least be listening.<br>
<br>

 If by successful, you mean survive, sure. But it 
would be a severely weakened ACC which would quickly become the equivalent of 
the Big East in the current football heirarchy.<br>

<br> As I said, the list isn't perfect but on the flip side my thinking 
included the following...<br>
<br>
 Arizona has a .622 winning % in the NCAAs, 
1 NC, 4 FFs, and 8 Elite 8s.<br>
<br>
 Florida has a .700 winning % in the 
NCAAs, 2 NCs, 4 FFs, and 6 Elite 8s.<br>
<br>
 They were the last two to make 
my Kings bb list, but I think they have enough separation from the other 
Barons. Also, I tried to balance the two Kings list with 13 programs each. 
Georgetown probably would have bumped one of them, but I was trying to tie the 
Kings/Barons list to conference realignment, so ruled out the non-FBS programs 
from consideration.<br>
<br>
 Again, anyone who wants to make their own lists, 
I have no problem with that. Knock yourselves out. My list wasn't meant to be 
the be-all and end-all on the discussion, just a starting point.<br>
<br>

<strong>RE: Revisiting Kings and Barons both Football and Basketball </strong> 
<br>  From an ACC football perspective this makes us LOOK weak... our Kings 
have seen far better days, our barons can't win their bowl games... I agree, we 
need to see FSU and Miami to get back to previous program levels of success. 
Without that, we're no better than the Big East, who will have a regular top 
ten program among their ranks soon.<br>
<br>
 As for the basketball list, 
basketball is such a different mindset - I don't know how you can make a kings 
and barons list and not include programs like G-town, Butler, Xavier, and 
Gonzaga... they're programs that are very much a part of the movers and shakers 
of basketball in the public mind and awareness now. <br>

 I think the 5 blue bloods are a step 
above the rest of the Kings. They should be in a category above the Kings. 
Also, I'd add Temple to the FBS football fielding basketball barons list. 
They've been good forever. <br>
