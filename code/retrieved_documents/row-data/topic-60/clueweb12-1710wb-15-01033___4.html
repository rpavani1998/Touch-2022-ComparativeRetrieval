<h1>The Financial Primacy Of College Football Over&nbsp;Basketball </h1>

<p>Last week, Bellerophon talked about the recent fall in both ticket sales 
and overall athletic revenue, as well as the general stagnation in revenue as 
compared to leading NCAA athletic programs. Using the recently updatedUSA Today 
college financial database and the accompanying article on athletic department 
revenue, his look at the Texas and Michigan program put into sharp focus the 
struggles of Morgan Center in raising revenue, generally as well as through 
ticket sales. While selling tickets is one problem that Morgan Center needs to 
solve, another significant thing that needs to be addressed is the recruitment 
and retention of athletic donors (or boosters).</p> 
<p>There are sure to be improvements that Morgan Center can make in terms of 
selling the department, the successes and financial needs of the various teams 
to donors wealthy or not. But also, the fortunes of fellow major Division-1 
schools have shown that success in football can lead to an enlarged donor base 
and significantly increased gifts to the athletic department. I don't say this 
to mean that another fluke 10-win season or beating Southern cal the next 
couple of years will suddenly open the financial floodgates, but that Football 
is the sport that drives everything else in a D-1A (FBS) athletic department- 
no matter how good the other sports are, and making an investment in Football 
will pay off in the long run far more than the sum of the investment, and more 
than applying those resources to any other sport on campus.</p> 
<p>Revenue from ticket sales is one portion of athletic revenue where the 
football powers have an advantage, given that even given the fewer number of 
games (7-8 football home games, compared to 18-20 home games for a basketball 
power), the massive, always sold-out stadiums bring in far more money than even 
a sold-out Dean Dome or Allen Fieldhouse with triple the number of games. The 
limitation of the effect of this factor however is that even mediocre college 
football teams draw pretty well, particularly where there is a greater culture 
of athletic success at the university; for example, UNC and Kentucky may not be 
that great in football right now, but they stillsell out their nearly all their 
games.</p> 
<p>A Far more significant factor that distinguishes the major Football schools 
from the Basketball powers is the level of private contributions to the 
athletic department. Leaving out schools with a solid-to-strong Football 
profile and high donor revenue, but having a single uber-wealthy &quot;sugar 
daddy&quot; alumni to fund their needs - like Oregon and Oklahoma State, there 
are several schools that can fairly said to be Football powers - such as 
Alabama, LSU, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Texas for example, as well as some 
strong-to powerful Basketball schools such as Kansas, Kentucky, UNC and 
UConn.&nbsp; While not limiting myself just to those few schools, there is a 
clear hierarchy in the level of donations among the various powers: the 
Football schools bring in significantly more in donations than do the 
Basketball leaders. (notes: While UCLA is pretty well-balanced in terms of 
athletic success including in football, I'm including the Bruins in the 
Basketball category due to our school's reputation in the sport, plus the 
opinion that our administration has not been taking Football as seriously as 
they could be. Also, I omitted Florida as they have had pretty strong recent 
success in both revenue sports which would throw off the fundraising 
distinctions between the major sports, while Southern Cal and Duke are not in 
this discussion because as private institutions, their financial data is not 
publically available in the same manner as for public universities).</p> 
<p>Courtesy of USA Today, here is the donor revenue received by the following 
athletic departments with leading Football programs - the first set of numbers 
for the last reported fiscal year (2009-10), the second from the 2004-05 year:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Alabama: 2009-10: $33,739,056 -- 2004-05: $20,262,542</p> 
<p>Florida State: 2009-10: $23,245,513 -- 2004-05: $16,414,490</p> 
<p>LSU: 2009-10: $38,255,521 -- 2004-05: $11,189,385</p> 
<p>Ohio State: 2009-10: $27,327,347 -- 2004-05: $19,829,555</p> 
<p>Oklahoma: 2009-10: $26,601,241 -- 2004-05: $10,096,423</p> 
<p>Texas: 2009-10: $37,110,292 -- 2004-05: $22,324,445</p> 
<p>West Virginia: 2009-10: $15,729,528 -- 2004-05: $6,917,286</p> </blockquote>
<p></p> 
<p></p> And here is the donor revenue for some of the leading basketball 
schools:
<p></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>UCLA: 2009-10: $9,332,803 -- 2004-05: $6,745,798</p> 
<p>Connecticut: 2009-10: $5,950,265 -- 2004-05: $6,212,138</p> 
<p>Indiana: 2009-10: $18,475,498 -- 2004-05: $8,129,276</p> 
<p>Kansas: 2009-10: $16,193,021 -- 2004-05: $18,500,207</p> 
<p>Kentucky: 2009-10: $13,161,669 -- 2004-05: $8,060,667</p> 
<p>Louisville: 2009-10: $16,781,073 -- 2004-05: $11,507,810</p> 
<p>North Carolina: 2009-10: $14,634,189 -- 2004-05: $10,834,440</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>There's a lot of interesting things that come out from looking through 
those numbers, and through theUSA Today database. While in the Big East, 
Louisville serves as a big outlier- which UConn proves to be the exception, the 
general reality is that the schools with major Football programs notably and 
significantly outperform those known for their Basketball programs. As well as 
the general variation between schools in the two groups, also notice the 
difference between Basketball Schools and Football schools in the same 
conference (aside from the Pac-10, I included at least one of each from each 
BCS conference).</p> 
<p>An interesting takeway comes from the ACC. This is considered to be very 
much a Basketball conference, yet the largest level of contributions among 
public schools in the ACC went to Florida State, a school with (relatively) 
mediocre basketball but a strong football program over the past three decades. 
For that matter, Virginia Tech received more in athletic donations last year 
than did UNC, despite its own relative weakness in Basketball plus not having 
the same base of wealth to draw from as does UNC (or other flagship state 
universities). Likewise, the Big East is known for its Basketball prowess more 
than for Football; while I noted that Louisville looks to be the exception to 
the rule, the other Big East Basketball power (with a FBS-level Football 
program) UConn took far less in donor revenue last year than did the 
conference's strongest public Football school, West Virginia.</p> 
<p>Another display of the significance of football can be seen through the 
ongoing&nbsp;Conference Re-Draft that the SBN blogs have been participating in. 
While the project is simply an idea of how the NCAA could look if geographical 
and current conference alignments were thrown out the window, the idea is to 
put together a collection of schools comprising the strongest athletic 
conferences. The people taking charge of the project know a heck of a lot about 
college sports, and from being able to keep up with the offline discussion 
surrounding it, they are taking selections, and weighing the advantages and 
disadvantages of all the D-1 schools very seriously. While there are different 
strategies in conference-building, and some variation in what the 'best' school 
or the best athletic program is, there is a consistent theme - the top programs 
as selected by the SBN editors have all been Football powers (or in the case of 
Notre Dame, a past Football power with its own significant Football TV 
contract). Success - or at least the perceived capability for success - in 
Basketball and in non-revenue athletics has served to distinguish among these 
top programs, see Texas and Florida as the top-2 selections.</p> 
<p>Taking from the Re-Draft, another demonstration of the power of Football 
from the project can be seen inthe difference between Duke and North Carolina. 
Duke and UNC are arguably the two most successful and highest profile programs 
in college basketball today, and both also have a pretty solid program of
non-revenue sports. On the draft board, UNC came in 18th, right between Oregon 
and Stanford; despite Duke's dominance in the world ofmarketing and revenue 
through basketball, they didn't go until #36. With similar profiles in 
Basketball and non-revenue sports, and sharing the same media markets, there 
really is one factor that would explain the value of UNC to be so much higher 
than that of Duke. The Power of Football. Not to hurt the folks in Durham, but 
Duke football is a national joke. Aside from a couple of good years under Steve 
Spurrier in the '80's, the program has accomplished nothing, and has no real 
signs of life for the future. While UNC Football is facing someserious charges 
from the NCAA which could affect the program in the short-term, and have not 
had a great deal of success in the sport, they have long been thought of as a 
&quot;sleeping giant&quot; in the college football world that has the ability 
and resources to become a factor in the ACC and nationally.</p> 
<p>There are several universities throughout the nation that are blessed to 
have sterling athletic reputations and tradition when it comes to one of the 
major sports. While being one of the leaders in a revenue sport serves as a 
boost in prestige, Football serves as a more significant boost to donor revenue.
