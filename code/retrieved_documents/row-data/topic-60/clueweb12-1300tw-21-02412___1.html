<p>A common point of discussion that always seems to appear is the fight for 
the top point guards in the NBA. While there is no doubt that Chris Paul and 
Derrick Rose hold the top two when ranking point guards, the next three players 
have not been as clear. These three guards are Deron Williams, Russell 
Westbrook, and Rajon Rondo.</p> 
<p>Up to this point, Deron Williams is averaging 21.9 PPG, 3.3 RPG, and 8.2 
APG.</p> 
<p>Russell Westbrook is averaging 24 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 5.4 APG.</p> 
<p>Rajon Rondo is averaging 12.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 10.7 APG.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Currently the New Jersey Nets sit tied with the Raptors for last in the 
Atlantic division with just a mere 16 wins.&nbsp; However, Deron Williams has 
still found a way to dish out 8.2 APG.</p> 
<p>Throughout the season, the Nets have been dealing with multiple injury 
problems. The biggest one is the loss of big man, Brook Lopez. Brook was the 
Nets best scoring option last year as he averaged a stellar 20 PPG. As a result 
to the injury, Deron was forced to find other options in order to keep his 
assist total high.</p> 
<p>Even though the Nets do have a minimal amount of wins, Deron has 
successfully made other players better with his passing ability.</p> 
<p>Nets rookie MarShon Brooks is averaging 12.8 PPG, big man Kris Humphries is 
averaging 13.5 PPG, and guard Anthony Morrow is averaging 12.6 PPG. As you can 
see, Deron&rsquo;s great passing capability has made everyone around him look 
better. On top of that he is averaging a very respectable 22 PPG.</p>

<p>Many say that Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics easily is the third best 
point guard in the league behind Rose and Paul. However, looking at his stats, 
they can&rsquo;t be saying that because of his scoring ability; as it is 
average at best with 12.7ppg.</p> 
<p>The number that pops out is his assist total which is 10.7. While this is a 
very high number, there are some key factors that need to be considered.</p> 
<p>Unlike Deron Williams, Rondo is playing amongst three arguable future hall 
of famers in Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett. All of which are 
extremely talented scorers. This makes Rondo&rsquo;s job a lot easier.</p> 
<p>Our last victim is Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook.</p> 
<p>While Westbrook outscores Williams, he has nowhere close to the amount of 
assists. One would think that out of all of them, he would have the most. This 
is because he is playing besides arguably one of the best players in the NBA in 
Kevin Durant. Also, turnovers have proven to be a very big problem for 
Westbrook thus far.</p> 
<p>Many people are looking forward to seeing these guards clash for the rest 
of the season.</p>

<p>well written, but ill have to respectfully disagree with this article</p> 
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Blake Zitman <br>

<p>I&nbsp;guarantee you that if Deron was playing aside KG, Allen, and Pierce 
hed have 10+ assists and on top of that have a higher ppg then rondo&nbsp;</p> 
</li> </ul> 
<li> Danny Ringel <br>

<p>just because i feel that rando is still better just my opinion though</p>
