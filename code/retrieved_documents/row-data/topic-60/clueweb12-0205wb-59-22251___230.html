<p><b>Land use code approved, 2 key players absent</b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It was like a scene from Houston's mission control, but instead of Neil 
Armstrong's voice announcing the safe touchdown of a lunar lander, it was the 
voice of Larry Garcia, chair of the Archuleta County Planning Commission, 
announcing successful completion of stage one in the approval process for the 
county's revised land use code and zoning program.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's unanimous, we have an adoption,&quot; Garcia said, before 
dropping the gavel and adjourning Monday's joint, planning commission and board 
of county commissioner's public hearing and work session.</p> 
<p>With Garcia's words, applause rang out in the commissioners' meeting room 
and much handshaking and backslapping ensued.</p> 
<p>For proponents, the approval marked a new beginning for county land use, 
including institution of county-wide zoning; but for the plan's opponents, the 
approval marked the beginning of the end. And for both, proponent and opponent 
alike, it was an historic moment in Archuleta County history.</p> 
<p>However, despite the poignancy of the event, those in opposition did not 
stay for the revelry. After their demand that the question of zoning and the 
land use code be put to county voters was denied, the handful trickled out of 
the meeting room.</p> 
<p>And aside from the momentary drama between plan opponent Sandy Bramwell and 
Archuleta County Commissioner Ronnie Zaday, who offered a stiff, emphatic 
rebuttal and ultimate denial of Bramwell's &quot;put-it-to-the-voters&quot; 
request, the meeting moved forward without incident, and drew a 
standing-room-only crowd, including full representation from the county's 
planning commission, attendance by county planning staff and Archuleta County 
Commissioners Mamie Lynch and Ronnie Zaday.</p> 
<p>Despite the strong turnout, there were two notable absences - Archuleta 
County Director of County Development Blair Leist and Archuleta County 
Commissioner Robin Schiro. </p> 
<p>County Administrator Bob Campbell said Leist had submitted his resignation 
to county officials roughly two weeks prior, but had agreed to stay at his post 
until completion of the land use code adoption process in June.</p> 
<p>Campbell said following an escalation of personal pressures, Leist opted to 
leave last week but would be available by phone during Monday's meeting.</p> 
<p>Leist did not call during the session, and David Alvord, senior planner and 
interim director of county development, filled Leist's role.</p> 
<p>Also missing, and one who offered to call into the session, was Schiro. </p>
<p>According to Campbell, Schiro had left town to attend the National 
Association of Counties (NACo) Western Interstate Region Conference in 
Sacramento, Calif.</p> 
<p>According to the commissioner's rolling calendar, Schiro had scheduled May 
8 to travel to the event and May 9 to begin attending the conference.</p> 
<p>According to the convention schedule posted on the National Association of 
Counties Web site, the convention does not officially start until May 10, 
although the conference does offer an optional May 9 agriculture/rural affairs 
field trip.</p> 
<p>Neither Lynch nor Zaday were aware that Schiro serves on a NACo agriculture 
committee.</p> 
<p>In a letter to the editor published in the SUN, Schiro stated the current 
draft of the land use code was rife with &quot;many unresolved, significant 
issues,&quot; and she implored county residents to attend Monday's meeting, 
stating it was an &quot;important topic that will affect all of Archuleta 
County for years and perhaps generations to come.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although county residents and staff came, Schiro and her phone call did not.
</p> 
<p>According to county documents, Schiro had scheduled 31 out-of-town trips 
between Jan. 27, 2006 and the present - a time period totaling 104 days - and 
at a current cost of $470 to the county. However, days absent could exceed 31, 
because trips are defined as any out- of-Archuleta County-excursion, with a 
one-day or multi-day trip both counted as one.</p> 
<p>For example, a six-day NACo conference held in March in Washington D.C. 
counts as one trip, as does the present, multi-day Sacramento conference.</p> 
<p>By press time, The SUN was unable to confirm how many of the 31 trips 
Schiro had taken.</p> 
<p>Future tentatively scheduled items include trips to Durango, Keystone, 
Colo., a six-day NACo conference in Chicago and a &quot;PEAK Afterschool 
Conference&quot; regarding after-school learning at Copper Mountain Resort.</p> 
<p>According to PEAK conference documents, &quot;The PEAK Afterschool 
Conference provides a forum for practitioners, program directors, community 
partners, and leaders in the field of out-of-school time to network and learn 
through high quality professional development experiences.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to Lynch and Zaday, neither Schiro nor any other commissioner has 
been appointed to NACo because Lynch and Zaday believe the county coffers 
cannot weather the burden of the travel expenses.</p> 
<p>&quot;We cannot afford the travel that's involved and I think our resources 
are better spent for the immediate needs in Archuleta County,&quot; Lynch said.
</p> 
<p>With the planning commission's approval, a revised set of county land use 
regulations, a zoning transition plan and a zoning map are well on their way to 
becoming official documents designed to guide growth, development and land use 
in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>With the current draft incorporating changes brought forth during the 
Monday work session, the document includes basic design guidelines for 
commercial structures, a voluntary scenic overlay program, eight zoning 
districts and comprehensive oil and gas regulations.</p> 
<p>The oil and gas regulations include criteria for monitoring methane content 
in water wells, mitigation requirements to minimize the impact of oil and gas 
truck traffic on county roads and setbacks for oil and gas sites near 
recreational areas and schools.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our new oil and gas regs will probably be the best,&quot; Alvord said.
</p> 
<p>In addition to his satisfaction with the oil and gas regulations, Alvord 
was pleased with the land use code project as a whole.</p> 
<p>&quot;It gives us a baseline to address future growth, it allows us to 
preserve what we have, it will help keep costs reasonable for development and 
infrastructure, and will identify and maintain viable areas of open space for 
community use and preservation. It's a long time coming,&quot; Alvord said.</p> 
<p>However, the planning commission's unanimous approval serves only as a 
recommendation, and the question will be put to the board of county 
commissioners for final approval at 9 a.m. May 23 in the south conference room 
of the Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>As part of the May 23 adoption hearing, the board will also decide on a 
zoning transition plan that will provide a set of procedures for the creation 
of the county's first official zoning map.</p> 
<p>Public participation is encouraged at the May 23, adoption hearing. </p> 
<p><b>District looks to finance hospital, buy ambulance</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Health Service District Board of Directors held its 
regular monthly meeting Tuesday and, among other things, discussed funding 
options for a new hospital, recent election results and the purchase of a new 
ambulance. </p> 
<p>Once board chair Pam Hopkins called the meeting to order and secretary Bob 
Scott recognized an official quorum, Hopkins administered the oath of office to 
Scott, Kitzel Farrah, Neal Townsend and Michelle Visel, all reelected to the 
board in a special election last week. Final canvassing by a three-member 
election committee ratified candidate vote totals at 1,197, 1,190, 1,137, and 
1,046 respectively.</p> 
<p>The issue receiving the most attention in last week's election was the 
Upper San Juan Health Service District Ballot Issue A, which asked registered 
voters if district debt should be increased by $12 million (with a repayment 
cost of $33.5 million) to pay for construction of a new Critical Access 
Hospital (CAH) in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Voter turnout was higher than expected, and the official results showed 
1,321 in favor, with 107 opposed. The canvassing committee finished final 
canvassing the afternoon of Wednesday, May 3.</p> 
<p>Having obtained voter approval for a new hospital, the district suddenly 
faced the enviable position of selecting from a list of lenders to borrow from. 
The choice ultimately came down to four different institutions, which all 
offered attractive rates. However, upon further evaluation, viable options were 
reduced to two, including Wells Fargo and United Missouri Bank. In the end, 
United Missouri Bank got the nod, largely because of its low rate and extensive 
experience in lending to health care facilities. The rate was not revealed at 
Tuesday's meeting.</p> 
<p>According to Hopkins, borrowing will be done in two phases. The first will 
take place in July, and involve $10 million at a guaranteed lower rate. In 
November, the second phase will make $2 million available, but the district 
will not take possession until sometime in 2007, depending on need. 
Collectively, the board hopes it won't need the $2 million, but Hopkins 
suggested construction costs are rising rapidly, and the money will be 
available if necessary.</p> 
<p>When asked what affect rising costs could have on the hospital project, 
Hopkins said, &quot;If costs go up considerably, we'll start cutting. The 
voters approved a cap of $12 million, so we have to build smart, and the 
architect's design has to be very specific to reduce the need for later 
changes. Changes increase the cost and length of the project.&quot;</p> 
<p>The district is now in communication with architects (Prochaska) and its 
contractor, G.E. Johnson, to ready plans for the commencement of construction 
sometime next fall. </p> 
<p>Goodman outlined the district's current financial status, which reflected 
$296,375 cash on hand at the end of March, and approval of a request for 
district manager Pat Haney to become a signatory on USJHSD expenditure checks 
up to $5,000 generated a lengthy exchange. Approval was eventually granted, 
with further review set in 60 days.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, USJHSD has been searching for a new ambulance and at Tuesday's 
meeting, choices were narrowed to two. Of the seven originally considered, 
three were priced above the $105,000 budgeted, another was a demo with 14,000 
miles on it and a fourth couldn't be ready for nearly eight months. And, based 
on the current condition of the district's Emergency Medical Services fleet, 
board members felt the need was more immediate.</p> 
<p>Therefore, the choice has come down to two different units, one built by 
Braun, Inc., and the other by Leader. Both are 2006 models mounted on Ford 350 
chassis, both are box-type construction, and each will require certain add-ons 
to completely satisfy district needs.</p> 
<p><b>Polling places, procedures changed</b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County voters accustomed to casting their ballots by precinct are 
in for a change.</p> 
<p>Following a May 2 decision by the Archuleta County Board of County 
Commissioners, voters countywide will now cast their ballots at one of three 
new vote centers, rather than the usual precinct polling places.</p> 
<p>Archuleta County Clerk and Recorder June Madrid said part of the push for 
vote centers is built on the premise of creating greater convenience for 
voters. Rather than rushing around after work or on a lunch hour to reach a 
potentially distant precinct polling place, Madrid said voters can now vote at 
any vote center location.</p> 
<p>&quot;The whole gist of it is that you want people to vote near where they 
work. It provides a conveniences to voters, there's no wrong place to 
vote,&quot; Madrid said.</p> 
<p>As established by the board's approval, all three centers are within the 
Pagosa Springs area - none are located in the outlying areas of the county.</p> 
<p>Madrid said the decision to concentrate the vote centers in Pagosa Springs 
had much to due the with distribution and concentration of voters in the Pagosa 
area, economics, the availability of grant funds and the county's 
responsibility to meet the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requirements.</p> 
<p>Madrid explained that according to the HAVA act, each polling location is 
required to have special voting equipment, called Direct Recording Equipment 
(DRE), that can accommodate the needs of physically challenged electors or 
electors, with virtually any disability. With Archuleta County's 10 voting 
precincts, the act requires installation of 10 DREs.</p> 
<p>While Madrid said the machines are impressive in their ability to meet the 
needs of disabled or physically challenged electors, they are also new, 
utilizing relatively new technology and are, as of yet, unproven in a real 
election scenario.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, rather than receiving a $160,000 grant for a 10-precinct 
installation, the county received only $56,000 from the Help America Vote Act.
</p> 
<p>In order to fully comply under the 10-precinct scenario, Madrid said the 
county would have to provide the remaining $105,000 - funds Madrid said, the 
county does not have.</p> 
<p>Each machine costs roughly $12,000 with associated software and set-up 
costs.</p> 
<p>Therefore, in order to bring the Direct Recording Equipment to Archuleta 
County as per the HAVA mandate, Madrid said she opted to establish vote 
centers. This strategy, she said, would allow the county to meet the needs of 
disabled or physically challenged voters, would keep the county in line with 
the Help America Vote Act and would keep the initial cash outlay for the Direct 
Recording Equipment at a minimum until the bugs could be worked out of the new 
technology and the county coffers could better weather the expense.</p> 
<p>Madrid said the upcoming primary election would be a key proving ground for 
both the new voting machines and the election centers. She added that if the 
process proves unwieldy or compromises electors in outlying areas of the 
county, a fourth vote center could be established if Direct Record Equipment 
can be procured.</p> 
<p>Currently, there are 396 registered electors in the Arboles area, and 
Madrid said after analyzing voter numbers and historic voter turnout she 
concluded it was not economically feasible to put a vote center in Arboles and 
she opted to concentrate vote centers in the Pagosa Springs area.</p> 
<p>&quot;If vote center's work, we'll stick with three and have a back-up 
(DRE)&quot; Madrid said.</p> 
<p>How vote centers work</p> 
<p>In the past, electors voted at a polling place based on their place of 
residence. With vote centers, electors will cast their ballots at the nearest, 
or most convenient, vote center location.</p> 
<p>Prior to the election, Madrid said electors will receive a signature card 
in the mail. The card must be filled out and brought, along with a valid form 
of identification, to the election center on election day - the primary is on 
Aug 8 and the general election is Nov. 7. If an elector does not receive a 
signature card via mail, one can be filled out at the vote center, however 
Madrid said electors should budget extra time for the procedure.</p> 
<p>Once at the vote center, electors will present their documents to election 
officials, and a ballot containing all pertinent questions relating to where 
the elector lives, such as questions regarding special taxation districts, will 
be produced.</p> 
<p>To cast their ballots, voters will have a choice between the familiar paper 
ballot or using one of the new voting machines.</p> 
<p>Madrid said the new voting machines require about 10 minutes for voters to 
cast their ballots.</p> 
<p>The following is a list of the three Pagosa Springs vote center locations:
</p> 
<p>- Archuleta County Elections Department, 449 San Juan St. - on the backside 
and in the basement of the Archuleta County Courthouse.</p> 
<p>- Our Savior Lutheran Church, 56 Meadows Dr. at the intersection of west 
U.S. 160 and Meadows Drive.</p> 
<p>- The Restoration Fellowship Church, 264 Village Drive</p> 
<p>Early voting</p> 
<p>To ease the pressure on election day, the board of county commissioners 
also approved early voting for Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Under state statute, and without a county resolution, early voting must 
begin 10 days prior to the primary election and 15 days prior to the general 
election.</p> 
<p>With the commissioners' May 2 approval, early voting will commence when 
Madrid receives the ballots - roughly 30 days prior to either election.</p> 
<p>Madrid estimates primary election ballots will be available around July 10.
</p> 
<p>Once received by the county, Madrid said registered electors can come to 
the county clerk's office to pick up a ballot. She said ballots can be filled 
out and returned at the same time, or electors can take the ballot away and 
return it by election day.</p> 
<p>Madrid added that electors can only take a ballot for themselves. For 
example, spouses cannot take ballots for their wives or husbands, however, an 
individual can return a completed ballot on someone else's behalf.</p>

<p><b>Police seek to identify evidence</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs police investigators have some interesting evidence from one 
of two recent burglaries in town, and are seeking help in identifying possible 
suspects.</p> 
<p>According to Det. Scott Maxwell, there is a strong suspicion the two 
incidents are related.</p> 
<p>The first burglary was reported April 29. An exterior door at the Adobe 
Building, 475 Lewis St., was kicked in and a suspect or suspects entered the 
building. The entry resulted in damage to the door.</p> 
<p>A door to an office inside the building was kicked in, but the office was 
vacant and nothing was taken.</p> 
<p>When the owner of the building discovered the damage April 29, he found a 
key ring in the entry to the building - a key ring Maxwell believes might have 
been dropped by a suspect. As seen in the accompanying photo, the key ring is 
distinctive and could be easily identified and linked to the individual who 
dropped it.</p> 
<p>A second burglary was reported May 1 and Maxwell said officers believe the 
incident at The Antler Shed, 150 E. Pagosa St., occurred Sunday, April 30.</p> 
<p>The manner in which the building was entered, with the exterior door kicked 
in, leads officers to suspect a link with the burglary at the Adobe Building.
</p> 
<p>In the case of the Antler Shed, there was a loss. The thief or thieves 
stole an antique cash register as well as some knives and belt buckles, among 
other items. The loss - in stolen items and damage - is estimated at $3,000.</p>
<p>Maxwell asked SUN readers to examine the photo accompanying this story and, 
if they recognize the key ring, to call him at the Pagosa Springs Police 
Department, 264-2131, Ext. 241.</p> 
<p><b>Work continues on Mill Creek Road dilemma</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The search for answers to the Mill Creek Road winter access puzzle 
continues.</p> 
<p>Thursday evening, U.S. Forest Service officials met with Archuleta County 
authorities and affected property owners to discuss the successes and failures 
of last winter's restricted access and snow removal arrangements on Mill Creek 
Road, and where the group should go from there.</p> 
<p>In a meeting lasting nearly two hours, the assembly gathered at the county 
Extension Building, where forest representatives described shortcomings 
associated with snowplowing and gate management agreements, which led to 
unauthorized road use and significant off-road resource damage, following a 
mandatory gate closure. Those shortcomings were detailed in a letter from the 
Forest Service to &quot;Mill Creek Road users&quot; in March 2006, and have 
prompted the agency to look for new ways of handling access restrictions and 
snow removal next winter, and in the years beyond.</p> 
<p>The access restrictions pertain to a three-mile stretch of road beginning 
at the San Juan National Forest boundary approximately four miles from the 
intersection of Mill Creek Road and U.S. 84, and continuing into the High West 
Unit 11, Mill Creek Ranch, Rito Blanco Ranch and Cimarrona subdivisions. The 
entire stretch lies within national forest jurisdiction.</p> 
<p>Last fall, following several similar meetings, the Forest Service agreed to 
rebuild three-tenths-of-a-mile of the road to an all-weather standard, install 
a road closure gate, build a parking lot, and provide a public winter access 
trail from the parking lot to the forest. The improvements were subsequently 
completed as promised, at an estimated cost of $27,000.</p> 
<p>In return, landowners agreed to supply a community lock for the gate and 
monitor its use, restricting access to all but authorized users and essential 
service providers. They were also to oversee snowplowing operations conducted 
by a private contractor working under a required special use permit issued by 
the Forest Service, who owns the road.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Forest Service employees reported numerous occasions over 
the winter where the gate was left unlocked or wide open. As a result, the 
Pagosa Ranger District received several calls from angry citizens who passed 
through the gate, only to find it closed and locked upon their attempted 
departure. At one point, when the gate was left open, forest employees say 
unauthorized off-road traffic caused significant resource damage to the 
surrounding environment.</p> 
<p>Construction traffic also raised concern among forest personnel. According 
to the original agreement between the Forest Service and residents living 
beyond road's end, access restrictions were intended to authorize residential 
use, but not heavy construction traffic. Nevertheless, traffic related to three 
separate construction projects has continued since the original gate closure, 
and forest officials insist resulting road damage would have been severe under 
normal winter precipitation patterns.</p> 
<p>At this point, even with the glaring failure of last season's temporary 
approach to solving access issues, the Forest Service remains committed to 
helping affected Mill Creek residents find equitable short- and long-term 
solutions to their winter woes. And, while a group of resolute landowners 
remain steadfast in their pursuit of answers - in part, by applying pressure on 
county government to assume some responsibility - county authorities now seem 
willing to take on a more active role. </p> 
<p>Naturally, all sides prefer a long-term solution, which would involve 
upgrading the entire three miles to an all-weather standard (through a 
cooperative effort) and turning jurisdiction and maintenance responsibilities 
over to the county. The Forest Service and landowners favor this approach, and 
at Thursday's meeting, commissioners Ronnie Zaday and Robin Schiro described 
what conditions would be necessary, before the county could fairly accept the 
road, including forming a Local Improvement District (LID) and a Public 
Improvement District (PID).</p> 
<p>Both districts would have to be approved by a majority of registered voters 
living in the concerned areas, and both could take on various forms, depending 
on exact community needs. However, a LID would create a one-time tax, or mill 
levy, on all affected residents, which would pay to upgrade the road to 
acceptable county standards. A PID would then establish a continual tax on the 
same residents, which would offset annual county costs of maintaining the road.
</p> 
<p>Of course, while a LID and PID would satisfy county requirements and 
alleviate the Forest Service of further responsibility of road ownership, 
getting them approved by a majority vote remains the primary obstacle to a 
final resolution. For now, only a handful of the approximate 140 landowners up 
Mill Creek Road live there year-round. Many of the rest seem content with 
seasonal access, even if it perpetuates lower land values.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, by the next meeting (scheduled for 6 p.m., June 12 at the county 
Extension Building), County Administrator Bob Campbell has promised to provide 
residents comprehensive information on how to achieve a vote, and how to 
structure improvement districts, should a vote ultimately be successful.</p> 
<p>Certainly, formulating a long-term solution will take a while, perhaps even 
years. In the meantime, the Forest Service has offered three other short-term 
options for consideration, and by meeting's end, residents unanimously agreed 
to pursue one, over the others.</p> 
<p>While involved parties will work out the finer points in coming months, 
residents must now attempt to form &quot;an association&quot; or other legal 
entity that can accept a special use permit from the Forest Service, and take 
responsibility for snow removal. In doing so, they will have to post a bond, 
which protects the Forest Service from incurring significant costs related to 
subsequent road damage. They will also have to closely monitor the gate, and 
agree to a seasonal suspension of all construction traffic and any unauthorized 
access.</p> 
<p>With time to iron out details before next winter, Mill Creek Road residents 
are, nonetheless, facing stiff challenges. However, as long as the Forest 
Service holds its commitment, landowners continue their resolve, and the county 
remains engaged, most agree, answers are forthcoming.</p> 
<p>Time will tell. </p>

<p><b>Big agenda, little progress at PAWSD meeting </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Despite three days of testimony and a judge's pending decision, the Pagosa 
Area Water and Sanitation District Board of Directors nearly averted mention of 
its Dry Gulch Reservoir litigation Tuesday.</p> 
<p>With a packed agenda for its monthly meeting, the PAWSD board rapidly 
advanced through the first several items with minimal discussion, and it 
appeared progress would be swift and complete. But, as the board began to 
address requests for reconsideration of various fees assessed to developers and 
private landowners recently, progress quickly ground to a screeching halt.</p> 
<p>Without the benefit of legal council present, board members and staff 
struggled to find fair and equitable ways of handling relatively minor, yet 
complex questions, which ultimately absorbed the better part of three hours. By 
meeting's end, a full third of the agenda items, including an update on the Dry 
Gulch litigation case, were rescheduled for next month's meeting.</p> 
<p>Just prior to adjournment, when pressed for a quick comment on the 
reservoir matter, district manager Carrie Campbell said, &quot;We had three 
days of court testimony, each side presented its case, and the judge will 
render a decision within a month. And frankly, I feel pretty optimistic.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The proposed Dry Gulch project has come under fire from the Five Rivers 
Chapter of Trout Unlimited and the San Juan Citizens Alliance. The groups view 
the water district's move to secure a 35,000-acre-foot reservoir, plus the 
right to divert 200 cubic feet per second from the San Juan River east of 
Pagosa Springs to continually refill the reservoir, as essentially a water grab.
</p> 
<p>&quot;We think the project is much bigger than any substantiated need. 
We're not opposed to water storage and we're not opposed to a reservoir at Dry 
Gulch, but this project is extremely expensive and ties up way too much 
water,&quot; said Drew Peternell, an attorney for Trout Unlimited.</p> 
<p>According to water district documents, the Dry Gulch reservoir would be 
constructed about two miles east of Pagosa Springs and south of U.S. 160.</p> 
<p><b>View major lunar standstills at Chimney Rock </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karen Aspin</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>A major lunar standstill occurs on an 18.6-year cycle.</p> 
<p>Chimney Rock Archaeological Area is the only venue we know of where a 
natural observatory frames the view of this lunar phenomena and a public 
viewing program has been established for the event.</p> 
<p>The first official public viewing since the rediscovery of the local major 
lunar standstill (MLS) phenomena at Chimney Rock Archaeological Area, by 
astronomer Dr. J. McKim Malville in 1988, was a success, according to Victoria 
White, MLS program administrator for the Chimney Rock Interpretive Association 
(CRIA). &quot;All who attended were very pleased.&quot;</p> 
<p>The night was spectacular, said White, following the August 2005 viewing. 
&quot;Rising on a nearly pitch-black backdrop, the moon was a stark contrast to 
the rock silhouettes, and everyone was ooohing and aaahing. Plus we had ... an 
awesome viewing of the Milky Way.&quot;</p> 
<p>CRIA has hosted seven events for the public to view moonrises between the 
spires at Chimney Rock Archaeological Area. In 2005, 183 participants trekked 
up and down the mesa, often in the dead of night.</p> 
<p>White said one point she thought should be stressed is that, during the 
major lunar standstill cycle, there are very few actual full moonrises between 
the rock spires, and that this seems to be one of the biggest public 
misconceptions - right up there with the notion that during Chimney Rock's full 
moon programs, visitors will see a full moon rise between the stone pillars, 
which is not the case. The Chimney Rock Web site, www.chimneyrockco.org, 
provides details on both the major lunar standstill program and the full moon 
program.</p> 
<p>White said 2005 ticket sales were brisk for MLS events, which are 
fund-raisers to support native Puebloan involvement at Chimney Rock. Due to 
limited viewing capacity, only 24 tickets were offered for each event. White 
said most of the available 2005 tickets were sold out by mid August.</p> 
<p>Reservations are required, said White. The $50 fund-raiser ticket includes 
a pre-event talk, mesa-top ascent and descent, and a presentation at the 
viewing area, with complimentary light refreshments and an optional 
presentation afterwards. White said participants should allow approximately 
three hours for the entire program, which is not suitable for children under 12.
</p> 
<p>&quot;All programs will be unique,&quot; White said, and she suggested 
those interested in tickets understand that, &quot;There are many things to 
consider in deciding which program is best for you: the phase of moon, the 
moonrise time, and weather conditions one may encounter during various times of 
the year.&quot;</p> 
<p>The 2006 tickets go on sale May 15.</p> 
<p>The season schedule, with gate times, is:</p> 
<p>- Saturday, July 22, 1:30 a.m., a crescent moonrise.</p> 
<p>- Thursday, Aug. 17, 11:30 p.m., a crescent moonrise.</p> 
<p>- Wednesday, Sept. 13, 9:15 p.m., quarter (half-moon) moonrise. </p> 
<p>- Wednesday, Oct. 11, 8 p.m., a gibbous (bulging/more than half) moonrise.
</p> 
<p>- Tuesday, Nov. 7, 4:45 p.m., a gibbous, yet more bulging, moonrise.</p> 
<p>- Tuesday, Dec. 5, 3:30 p.m., what many consider the biggest gift of the 
season - a full moon rises between the spires at sunset.</p> 
<p>This standstill cycle will provide one more viewing season in 2007, albeit 
still limited, because during the first half of each year, moonrises occur 
during the day, making them difficult to see, if at all.</p> 
<p>Due to nature's unpredictability there is no guarantee you'll enjoy a 
moonrise between the spires, even at a scheduled event during the second half 
of a year. &quot;We are only offering an opportunity to view this event,&quot; 
said White. &quot;We will not cancel it or give refunds if the moonrise is 
obscured by weather. Participants are also paying for the program itself, which 
will occur unless weather conditions are deemed unsafe. If hazardous weather 
conditions prohibit our ascent to the viewing area, and this results in the 
cancellation of this program, we will make every effort to reschedule it for 
the following night, weather permitting.&quot; White urged those interested in 
participating in these programs to read the full cancellation policy on the Web 
site.</p> 
<p>For MLS tickets, call Chimney Rock Interpretive Association at 264-2287, 
beginning May 15. If you get voicemail, leave a message, as tickets are sold on 
a first-come, first-served basis. Your call will be returned in the order it 
was received.</p> 
<p>Chimney Rock Archaeological Area is located three miles south on Colo. 151, 
which is 17 miles west of Pagosa Springs via U.S. 160. The site is open for 
guided tours beginning May 15.</p> 
<p>The major lunar standstill viewings are sponsored by the Chimney Rock 
Interpretive Association, Inc., in partnership with the USDA Forest Service, 
San Juan National Forest, Pagosa Ranger District.</p> 
<p><b>Lauren White golf tournament Saturday </b></p> 
<p>Former Pagosa Springs residents Cindy, Burly and Chris White wanted to find 
some way to pay special tribute to their daughter and sister, Lauren, following 
her tragic death in a 2002 automobile accident.</p> 
<p>They also wanted some way of giving back to a community that had captured 
their hearts with a remarkable outpouring of generosity and love during their 
most difficult time.</p> 
<p>The family recalled how excited Lauren had been about receiving 
scholarships for college and thought a scholarship fund and program might a 
good place to start. They realized a scholarship to a student with special 
needs inspires a youngster, giving them a sense that there are those who 
believe in them and in their ability to achieve.</p> 
<p>With the help of directors of the Charles W. Hughes Foundation, the family 
found a way to establish the Lauren White Memorial Scholarship - a scholarship 
now administered with the help of staff at Pagosa Springs High School.</p> 
<p>A golf tournament was created to raise funds for the scholarship. </p> 
<p>The first tournament was held in the spring of 2003. The Whites believed 
the tournament was a great way to raise money to supplement what had already 
been donated, and to keep the scholarship active. &quot;We love doing it,&quot; 
said the Whites. &quot;The response from the community, and especially from 
local merchants, has been fantastic.&quot;</p> 
<p>This year's four-person scramble tournament is set for a 10 a.m. shotgun 
start Saturday, May 13, at the Pagosa Springs Golf Club. There will be contests 
and giveaways, with lunch at the clubhouse.</p> 
<p>Everyone is invited to participate, at $50 per person.</p> 
<p>To sign up, call 731-4755, or visit the golf shop. Club pro and manager 
Alan Schutz said, &quot;This has become an annual event we all look forward to. 
We have lots of fun with it; it is a community celebration where we can get 
together and help out with an important cause.&quot;</p> 
<p>Merchants who wish to be sponsors can contact the pro shop at the club.</p>

<p><b>Mule Deer Association makes donation </b></p> 
<p><b>By Joe Lewandowski</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Colorado Mule Deer Association has donated $9,000 to the Colorado 
Division of Wildlife to aid mule deer habitat improvement.</p> 
<p>Eddie Vita, president of the Pagosa Springs chapter of the association 
presented the check to DOW Director Bruce McCloskey.</p> 
<p>&quot;The association appreciates the work done by the Colorado Division of 
Wildlife to improve mule deer herds throughout Colorado,&quot; Vita said.</p> 
<p>In February, the association held its annual Governor's Tag auction in 
Grand Junction. The Division of Wildlife donates one mule deer license to the 
association that can be used by a hunter anywhere in the state. A hunter from 
Utah offered the winning bid of $45,000.</p> 
<p>The association donated $9,000 of the proceeds to the DOW. The association

<p><b>Council seeks help with trails projects </b></p> 
<p><b>By Larry Lynch and John Applegate</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Area Trails Council is alive and well, even though we have not 
been in the news much this past year.</p> 
<p>The council is a non-profit organization formed several years ago to 
promote trails and facilitate trail construction and maintenance in the Pagosa 
area.</p> 
<p>The council was instrumental in the development of the Archuleta 
County/Town of Pagosa Springs Master Trails Plan that was adopted in 2003.</p> 
<p>The trails plan includes many miles of future trails in the community, 
details community needs and desires based on public input forums, trail design 
and criteria, trail locations and priorities and timelines for trail 
construction. A lot of time and effort went into this plan and the document is 
used extensively by both the town and county planning departments whenever 
trail issues come up. The council also monitors the implementation of the 
Trails Plan as new developments go through the approval process.</p> 
<p>The last few years, the council has concentrated on the completion of two 
new huts to add to the Turkey Springs Cabin. One new hut at Hotz Springs is 
complete and the other at Monument Park is very close. The Pagosa Hut and Trail 
System will allow users to take extended overnight trips that include the 
Turkey Springs area, Middle Mountain, Monument Park, Hotz Springs and 
connections to the Piedra River and Devil Mountain. Sounds like fun doesn't it?
</p> 
<p>For more information on this hut and trail system go to the Pagosa Area 
Trails Council Web site at pagosahuts.com.</p> 
<p>This summer, the council wants to refocus on trail construction and 
maintenance in the Pagosa area. We are planning several trail days this summer 
and we need volunteer help and involvement to make these trail improvements 
happen.</p> 
<p>Some trails just need maintenance and upkeep such as minor reroutes, brush 
and downed timber clearing and new drainage features. As part of Colorado 
Trails Day, the council announces volunteer trail work days June 3 and 4 to 
work on sections of trail near Monument Park. Contact John Applegate at 
731-9325 for information on this project and to sign up for volunteer work.</p> 
<p>The council has also been working with the Forest Service over the past 
several years to construct a trail system in Martinez Canyon, just west of 
Pagosa Lakes. This system will include a loop trail that follows Martinez 
Canyon and Stevens Draw near the Vista and Trails subdivisions, as well as 
connect to the other side of the canyon, providing access to the trails on 
Brockover Mesa, Turkey Springs and Chris Mountain. When completed, this will be 
an amazing trail system that has the advantage of being within walking distance 
of many residents in the community, or at the most a short car or bike ride 
away. Future trailhead parking areas are included in the project providing four 
different parking and trail access locations complete with informational signs.
</p> 
<p>This project has always seemed like a quality community trail proposal but 
the catch is there is no federal or local funding for trail construction with 
this project. It will have to be done entirely through volunteer efforts. This 
is where the council needs your help. If you would like to become involved in 
the Martinez Canyon trail project call Larry Lynch at 731-5635 for more 
information and to be added to the list of helpers.</p> 
<p>We have scheduled a trail work day for Martinez Canyon Saturday May 20. We 
plan to meet at 9 a.m. at the Vista Clubhouse then drive to the trail access 
point and walk into the canyon.</p> 
<p>The council will provide tools; please wear a good pair of work boots, work 
gloves and bring sunscreen and water. Bring a lunch and we will all eat 
together in the canyon.</p> 
<p>We would like to have several of these work days over the course of the 
summer and early fall. Even if you can only make one or two work days, your 
help will be much appreciated and the reward will be an amazing trail we can 
all enjoy.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Area Trails Council depends on community volunteers to get the 
job done. If you are interested in joining the council, we meet as a group once 
a month, on the second Wednesday of the month at the Chamber of Commerce 
meeting room during the lunch hour. Feel free to just show up. The council 
always needs new members to help plan and run our activities.</p> 
<p><b>Donations sought for fish stocking project </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Fishing in the San Juan River through Pagosa Springs is about to improve 
dramatically. But first, the fish have to arrive.</p> 
<p>According to Thadeus Cano, acting coordinator of the Pagosa Quality Fishing 
Project (PQFP), the annual supplemental river stocking through town will again 
take place some time between now and July 1. By then, if all goes well, some 
1,700 pounds of large catchable trout will have been introduced to various 
sections of river between the Apache Street bridge and the Conoco station near 
the intersection of U.S. 160 and U.S. 84.</p> 
<p>Though the Colorado Division of Wildlife permits the annual project, it is 
considered supplementary, because it is not part of the official DOW stocking 
program conducted each year. The DOW, of course, stocks several million 
catchable and sub-catchable trout in a broad variety of state waters every 
summer.</p> 
<p>Cano said the exact timing of the community project will depend on how soon 
the high-country snowmelt and subsequent San Juan runoff ends, but he believes, 
this season, it'll be sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, earlier concerns 
over the potential effects on stocking by the town's planned river improvements 
have apparently dissolved, as those plans have encountered bureaucratic delays 
that may push them into next year.</p> 
<p>This year's PQFP details are still being worked out, like how many 
deliveries it can actually afford, and how many pounds of very large, large and 
medium-sized fish each delivery will include. But, once all donations are in, 
special tanker trucks full of wriggling rainbows, and perhaps a few brown 
trout, will arrive in the days to follow.</p> 
<p>Even as the program enters its fourth year, it remains completely dependent 
on the generous contributions of a long list of Pagosa area citizens, merchants 
and financial institutions, who have supported it to the benefit of local 
tourism. Donations have increased steadily each year, with those of the 2005 
season totaling $6,123.</p> 
<p>According to Cano, that amount allowed the stocking of 159 pounds of 10- to 
12-pound cutbows, 502 pounds of three- to five-pound rainbows, 450 pounds of 
14- to 18-inch rainbows, and 200 pounds of 11- to 14-inch rainbows.</p> 
<p>When asked how the project determines the number and sizes of trout to 
stock, Cano explained that donors complete a form suggesting their preferences. 
All the forms are compiled, then reconciled into a formula that reflects the 
general consensus.</p> 
<p>This spring, Cano hopes to raise $7,380 in contributions, which will 
reflect the average annual increase seen over the previous three seasons. While 
confidant he'll reach his goal, he admits to lagging behind at this point, 
although some of the program's top supporters have yet to remit promised 
allocations.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're looking for new supporters too, so we can meet this goal,&quot; 
Cano said. &quot;We're asking our current supporters to twist arms, sweet talk, 
and beg other business owners or fishermen for their support.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cano said the cost of each delivery is expected to rise this year, but the 
hatchery supplying the fish, River Bend Trout Farm of Monte Vista, is also a 
program donor and provides certified disease-free trout at reduced rates.</p> 
<p>Cano hopes donations will arrive soon, to allow stocking by mid-June. He 
believes runoff will have come and gone by then, and the fish will have time to 
settle in to their new surroundings before the height of 2006 tourism, which 
should be the week of July 4.</p> 
<p>An account has been established at Wells Fargo for those wishing to 
contribute directly to the program. The account number is 624-5002974. For more 
information on the Pagosa Quality Fishing Project, call Thadeus Cano at 
264-2370.</p> 
<p>&quot;Providing this level of fishing right through town is a real benefit 
to the local economy,&quot; Cano said. &quot;Fishermen can walk to the river 
and catch big fish, while their families shop local stores, and they can all 
meet for lunch.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Don't disturb the swans </b></p> 
<p>According to Robbie Schwartz, of the Humane Society of Pagosa Springs, the 
organization has received many calls regarding the swans that live at Pinon 
Lake at Pagosa Lodge.</p> 
<p>Schwartz said she contacted Pat Jackson of St. Francis Bird Sanctuary. 
Jackson, in turn, contacted Mike Reid of the Colorado Division Wildlife.</p> 
<p>According to Jackson, Reid said the adult swans are nesting on the shore of 
the lake and should not be disturbed. There is concern that dogs, other animals 
or people will bother the adult swans and cause them to leave their nest.</p> 
<p>The adult swans cross the roads to go to other lakes; the four young birds 
are old enough to fly but haven't been seen doing this yet. They, too, walk to 
Village Lake.</p> 
<p>Even though the swans are wildlife they are privately owned by the lodge. 
Lodge management is encouraging people not to walk up to the nesting area to 
check on the swans.</p> 
<p>The Division of Wildlife is monitoring the situation. Officials would like 
the adult swans to be comfortable during the repair of the dam on Pinon 
Causeway and not abandon their nest.</p> 
<p><b>Colorado Wildlife Commission meets </b></p> 
<p>The Colorado Wildlife Commission met May 4 in Montrose. It took action on 
several issues and referred other items for further study and discussion. The 
following are the major issues decided by the Commission during the meeting:</p>
<p>- The commission approved big-game license numbers for deer, elk, bear, 
moose, and pronghorn. Highlights: Deer populations continues to rise and the 
number of licenses available overall will increase slightly; elk populations 
are stable and at objective, consequently cow licenses will be reduced by about 
10 percent (there are no limits on bull licenses in most of the state); 
pronghorn populations are rebounding from drought years early in the decade and 
doe licenses will be increased by 33 percent, buck license numbers will remain 
stable; moose populations are growing slowly and 185 licenses will be available 
statewide for 2006, up from 159 licenses in 2005; bears continue to struggle in 
many areas of the state, so the number of licenses will be reduced by 9 percent 
to 2,540. The complete list for license numbers for all game management units 
can be found at the Colorado Division of Wildlife's (DOW) Web site: 
http://wildlife.state.co.us. The commission also approved a requirement that 
all wildlife harvested through the use of an auction or raffle license shall be 
presented to and inspected by an employee of the DOW on or before the fifth 
working day after the animal is harvested.</p> 
<p>- People who are guided for hunting, fishing or wildlife viewing on 
Colorado State Wildlife Areas by a professional outfitter or guide will remain 
required to purchase a wildlife habitat stamp.</p> 
<p>- To assure that wildlife remains the primary focus at Colorado's State 
Wildlife Areas, the commission approved new restrictions at several of the 
areas around the state. These include a variety of restrictions pertaining to 
off-highway vehicles, camping and dogs at these State Wildlife Areas: Echo 
Canyon, Williams Creek, Lake DeWeese and Gypsum Ponds.</p> 
<p>- The commission heard testimony on a proposal to restrict collection of 
antler sheds on public lands only from April 1 through Dec. 31, starting in 
2007. The restrictions would be imposed to prevent shed collectors from 
harassing wildlife during the most severe months of the winter. The prohibition 
would be in effect during late-season hunts in specific game management units. 
The final regulations will be considered at the July commission meeting.</p> 
<p>- The commission considered proposed dates for upcoming waterfowl seasons. 
Dates are changed every year according to federal migratory bird guidelines, 
which are published by the federal government in June and July. These proposed 
dates can be found on the DOW web site and will be up for final consideration 
at the July commission meeting. If new federal regulations occur after the July 
meeting, the commission may modify its regulations in August.</p> 
<p>- The commissioners heard testimony to expand the number of small game 
species that can be legally taken. The Colorado Trappers Association had 
requested to add mink, marten, long- and short-tailed weasel, opossum, 
ringtail, western spotted skunk, swift fox and gray fox to the list of small 
game species. The final regulations will be considered at the July commission 
meeting.</p> 
<p>The Wildlife Commission also heard a presentation from the DOW staff 
regarding recommended restrictions on the taking of prairie dogs. The staff is 
recommending that the taking of prairie dogs on public lands be prohibited 
statewide on all species from March 1 to May 31 to provide protection of 
breeding adults and dependent young. The staff also recommends the Wildlife 
Commission consider allowing a shooting season on all prairie dog species 
outside of the closure period, including black-tailed prairie dogs which are 
found primarily on the Eastern Plains. The commission will consider this issue 
again at its July meeting.</p> 
<p>The commission also heard a presentation by the DOW staff regarding the use 
of an explosive device to control burrowing animals in areas where they are 
causing damage. The device uses a mixture of propane and oxygen and is 
detonated in a burrow. Staff explained that: The device offers a more humane 
method of killing the animals than the use of poisons; and the device is 
preferred by certified organic agricultural producers who are prohibited from 
using certain chemicals on their lands. The staff was directed to present the 
issue for future consideration at the commission's July meeting.</p> 
<p><b>Take simple precautions in bear season </b></p> 
<p><b>By Michael Seraphin</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>There are between 8,000 and 12,000 bears in Colorado and most of them have 
awakened from their winter hibernation.</p> 
<p>As the temperatures warm and snow pack melts, nature provides and new 
generation of tender young plants for bears to eat.</p> 
<p>Adult male bears usually emerge from their dens first. Females with cubs 
tend to come out later.</p> 
<p>For the first few weeks following hibernation, bears drink lots of water, 
helping their digestive system adjust. Once they are ready to eat again, they 
become relentless in their search for food. New grass, dandelions, and young 
plants are typical natural foods - but bears are opportunists and will eat 
anything they find.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) reminds people that an ounce of 
prevention is worth 200 pounds of cure. &quot;Many people do not realize that a 
few simple precautions can minimize the chance of unwanted encounters with 
bears. Right now, is the best time to walk your property and remove any bear 
attractants from sight and smell,&quot; said Bob Davies, a senior biologist 
with the DOW. He recommends &quot;bear-proofing&quot; your property by removing 
items a bear might consider potential food sources such as bird feeders, pet 
food left outside or unsecured trash cans.</p> 
<p>These things may seem insignificant, but they can create behavior patterns 
in bears which often cannot be reversed. If there was bear activity in your 
neighborhood last year, you'll need to be extra careful this year, as bears 
will return to the same locations where they have been successful finding food 
in the past. If the home or business owner does not take action to remove the 
bear attractants (anything that smells like potential food), it is only a 
matter of time before the bear will return.</p> 
<p>If you regularly see a bear on your property, assess the situation by 
discovering what is attracting the bear and take steps to remove the attractant.
</p> 
<p>Bears are generally shy and usually avoid humans, but their need for food 
and sense of smell often draws them to human residences.</p> 
<p>Remember, &quot;A fed bear is a dead bear.&quot; By making food available 
to a bear, people train it to associate humans with food. Once a bear learns 
this association, it can become dangerous and often must be killed.</p> 
<p>Colorado has a &quot;two strike&quot; rule for dealing with problem bears. 
The first time a bear gets into trouble, it receives an ear tag marking it as a 
problem bear. Another serious encounter, or &quot;second strike,&quot; means 
the bear will be killed.</p> 
<p>Here are some tips to prevent bears from becoming habituated to human food:
</p> 
<p>- Take down, clean and put away bird feeders. Bear damage to bird feeders 
is a common complaint. Once a bear has found a feeder in your yard, it will 
likely look around for other easy foods within reach.</p> 
<p>- Keep garbage in airtight containers inside your garage or storage area. 
Clean trash cans with ammonia or bleach occasionally to reduce odors that 
attract bears.</p> 
<p>- Consider a bear-proof Dumpster - if not available, ask your trash-removal 
company for options.</p> 
<p>- Place garbage for pickup outside just before collection and not the night 
before.</p> 
<p>- Do not place meat or sweet-smelling food scraps such as melon rinds in a 
compost pile.</p> 
<p>- Do not leave pet food or dishes outdoors at night.</p> 
<p>- Clean up and store outdoor grills after use. Sticky barbecue sauce and 
grease can attract bears to your yard.</p> 
<p>- Never intentionally feed bears to attract them to your yard for viewing. 
It's illegal to feed bears in Colorado - in addition to being bad for the bear; 
you will be ticketed and fined.</p> 
<p><b>Public invited to review and comment on plan revisions</b></p> 
<p>The San Juan Public Lands Center is hosting round of public meetings in May 
to offer updates on the San Juan National Forest Management Plan/BLM Resource 
Management Plan Revisions and to get feedback on three resource topics not 
discussed in detail during last year's study group meetings:</p> 
<p>- Draft Travel Suitability: areas where motorized use is appropriate, where 
motorized use is emphasized, and where non-motorized use is emphasized;</p> 
<p>- Draft Mineral Lease Areas: areas where oil and gas leasing is being 
considered;</p> 
<p>- Draft inventory of rivers and streams eligible for consideration as Wild 
and Scenic Rivers</p> 
<p>Maps showing the latest version of land allocations for the revised plan 
and possible alternatives will also be available for review.</p> 
<p>Study Group members and all interested members of the public are invited to 
attend the meetings. Meetings will begin at 6:30 p.m. and end at 9 p.m. 
Meetings will include maps and information for the entire planning area, with 
an emphasis on lands in the adjacent USFS Ranger District and BLM land.</p> 
<p>A meeting is set for May 23 in Pagosa Springs at the Pagosa Junior High 
School Library, with focus on the Pagosa Ranger District and BLM lands.</p> 
<p>PDF files of the Alternative maps and other maps being used in the analysis

<p><b>A mother's lessons </b> </p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It's true my father instilled in me a passion for fishing, but my mother is 
largely to blame for everything else. This thought came to me when I was 
reflecting on Mother's Day and time spent together during one of her more 
recent visits.</p> 
<p>Two years ago, we decided a Four Corners road trip would be a good way to 
spend time together while seeing the country. As agreed, she and my sister flew 
down from Seattle and met me at my home in Albuquerque.</p> 
<p>The plan was simple, I would act as tour guide and aside from two planned 
activities, the goal was to venture north through Santa Fe, Chama, Taos, Pagosa 
Springs and Durango, with stops at as many espresso joints, quilting shops and 
fishing holes as possible - she, and my sister, are avid and skilled quilters; 
I am an avid fly fisherman; and me and my mother are coffee addicts. The 
arrangement seemed equitable, the plan sufficient, and we set out.</p> 
<p>After a leisurely drive north through the Rio Grande valley with stops in 
Santa Fe, Chimayo, and Ranchos de Taos, our first evening found us at a hotel 
in Taos proper. After an early evening meal at Orlando's, I convinced my mother 
and sister to join me for an evening of flyfishing on the Rio Hondo just 
outside of town. They agreed, and we drove up the ski valley road, found a 
riverside pullout and I dove into a pair of waders while my bibliophile mother 
and sister dove into their respective books and hunkered down next to the river 
wrapped in quilts. I fished. They read. Everyone was happy.</p> 
<p>When I look back on that evening together, it strikes me that at that 
moment, me and my mother must have appeared very different - me decked out in 
high tech fishing gear stalking trout with maniacal intensity, she sitting at a 
picnic bench wrapped in a quilt reading - but in fact, although seemingly 
different, we are in fact, much the same, and who I am today, is probably due 
largely to her.</p> 
<p>While my father taught me how to read a trout stream, my mother taught me 
the pleasures of reading and instilled in me a love of books. While in 
elementary school, she fed my habit with regular trips to the library and she 
never discouraged long Saturday mornings spent in bed finishing up a sci-fi, 
fantasy or adventure novel.</p> 
<p>In her house, stacks of books were never clutter. They were a necessity. I 
remember the pile of a dozen or so books she kept next to her bed, and her 
sewing room, acting as a chaotic, surrogate library, bursting at the seams with 
countless volumes of fiction and nonfiction alike. And now, as an adult, it 
comes as no surprise, that in regard to books, my house is much like hers - 
books on shelves, books stacked on every flat surface and books next to the 
bed. Her passion for reading, exhibited streamside, is something I have 
inherited, and although I spent that evening on the Rio Hondo fishing, I have 
spent countless evenings, like her, nose buried in a book.</p> 
<p>While my father taught me how to drink in cold mountain air and the beauty 
of a remote wilderness vista, my mother taught me how to drink strong black 
coffee - coffee the consistency of roofing tar or creosote - coffee with a 
kick. And although wilderness and coffee may seem disparate, the two, in fact, 
are inextricably connected.</p> 
<p>Throughout the years, trips into the wilderness have helped maintain my 
sanity, while coffee, on deadline days at the paper, and throughout college 
during test times, has helped keep another part of me sane, and if not sane, at 
least functioning. Thanks to my mother, and perhaps genetics, I can drink the 
stuff any time of day or night and can sleep without difficulty soon thereafter.
</p> 
<p>Once, during a separate visit, we returned home around midnight after an 
evening out, and both craved a cup. I brewed a pot and we sat around sipping 
and talking for an hour then went to bed. At that point, it was clear we were 
truly of the same stock.</p> 
<p>While my father taught me how to take it easy, to slow down and relax, my 
mother took those lessons to new heights, and it is due to her that I have 
mastered the art of pre-bedtime napping. It sounds bizarre, but there's nothing 
quite like a good nap in your favorite chair, book flopped on the floor and a 
cold cup of coffee by your side, before you really hit the hay. A pre-bedtime 
nap gives you that boost of energy needed to finish that last chapter, that 
last quilting square, or that last paragraph of a writing project, before you 
seriously head for bed somewhere around 3 a.m. It's a technique I employ 
nightly, and I've used napping to great effect on trout streams. It's hard to 
beat sleeping away an afternoon in a field full of wildflowers, only to wake up 
rejuvenated, casting for cutthroats as the sun goes down.</p> 
<p>While my father taught me the patience required to stalk trout, my mother 
taught me patience with others. While growing up, she worked hard to raise five 
kids, and although my stepfather was there, I'm sure, at times, the pressures 
of motherhood were tough to bear. There were trips to the grocery store, times 
of sickness, the never-ending packing of school lunches, and the countless 
shuttles to soccer games and after school activities. And through all the chaos 
and occasional strife, she rarely lost her cool. I'd like to think I've 
absorbed some of that from her, and that patience is an integral part of who I 
am today. If it is, I have my mother to thank.</p> 
<p>While my father taught me to trust the strength of a well-tied knot, of 
good tackle and my instincts, my mother taught me to trust others. She taught 
me to trust what people say, to give people the benefit of the doubt, that 
people are generally good and forthright, that they are honorable until proven 
otherwise.</p> 
<p>Some might call her trust naivet&eacute;, yet my mother had confidence in 
the better side of human nature. And while trusting others was key, most 
importantly, she taught me to trust myself, because she did, when many probably 
didn't. I know that over the years I have given her much grey hair, and at 
times, I'm sure she had her doubts. But she always gave me room to roam, she 
let me discover, sometimes through hard knocks, who it is that I would 
ultimately become. She gave me freedom, and has taught, by her own example, 
acceptance.</p> 
<p>Soon after our evening along the Rio Hondo, our trip culminated in Durango 
with a trip on the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad. We opted for 
the full-day excursion, and true to form we sat in the open car in the chill of 
the early morning, eating pastries and sipping espressos. It was a trip, and a 
morning, I remember fondly to this day.</p> 
<p>It's true, my mother didn't teach me how to fish but she taught me respect, 
curiosity, and instilled in me a sense of wonder about the world and the people 
who live in it. It is her careful guidance, of knowing when to let go, of 
knowing when to be firm, of teaching by example not by lecture, that has shaped 
who I am today.</p> 
<p>These are lessons that transcend those learned on river, but they are 
lessons I apply during every excursion and before every cast. They are lessons 
that guide me through the day. Thanks - and happy Mother's Day.</p>

<p><b>Pay the fiddler</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I couldn't help laughing at Bob Dungan's letter about King George. No one 
likes the high price of gasoline, but we're getting exactly what we asked for, 
and it's not all George's fault. Americans have wasted energy like we have 
wasted food and every other commodity we have for years, and now we're 
&quot;paying the fiddler.&quot; It amazes me how Americans gripe about paying 
$3 a gallon for gasoline while they drink their $4 bottled water, which 
probably comes from a well in Tennessee.</p> 
<p>My wife and I just returned from a Caribbean cruise. We took an island tour 
on Curacao, and I asked our driver what the price of gasoline was there. Ready 
for this - $6 a gallon, U.S. dollars. They get their crude oil from Venezuela, 
which is 23 miles away. Venezuela signed an agreement with Curacao to provide 
crude oil, refine it on the Island, and provide their gasoline supply. I 
counted six big tankers from Venezuela dock the one day we were there. I'm sure 
some of that refined gasoline winds up in the U.S. Aruba, which is 18 miles off 
the Venezuelan Coast, turned down a similar agreement because they didn't want 
to get the shaft from Hugo Chavez like Curacao did. Aruba's gasoline is $3.79 a 
gallon, U.S. dollars. Oh, by the way, the price of gasoline in Venezuela is 
currently less than 20 cents a gallon. See, George isn't the only tyrant.</p> 
<p>Bob must live in a very sheltered world. Has he looked at the salaries and 
golden parachutes of other CEOs nationwide, besides oil executives? They are 
pretty similar. Eisner of Disney was making $23,000 a day when he was their 
CEO. Ever wonder why the tickets to Disney World are so high?</p> 
<p>Another highlight of the cruise, which reminded me of how arrogant we 
Americans are, and not just Republicans, came at Logan International Airport in 
Boston. As we were entering the American Airlines Terminal to fly home, I saw 
Senator John Kerry get into a stretch limo, which probably gets five miles per 
gallon. Write him a thank you note, Mr. Dungan, for his part in helping with 
gasoline conservation.</p>

<p><b>100 years</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>On June 7, my dear grandfather, Harold Comstock, will celebrate his 100th 
birthday. He was born in Pagosa Springs to John and Anne Comstock in 1906. My 
grandfather lived in the Pagosa Springs area until he was about 15 years old, 
at which time the family moved to Texas looking for work.</p> 
<p>My grandfather has many fond memories of his youth spent in the Pagosa 
Springs area. He loves to tell his many family members about growing up in 
Colorado. I thought it would be a wonderful surprise for his birthday if a few 
people from the Pagosa Springs area would send him a postcard from Colorado for 
his birthday. His address is: Mr. Harold Comstock, 715 Ave. D, Port Neches, TX 
77651.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

<p><b>Avoid &quot;old&quot;</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Joe and I want to thank you for publishing the news, with pictures (yeah) 
of our 65th wedding anniversary, which we observed March 21, 2006.</p> 
<p>There aren't many of our old friends left in Pagosa, but the memories are 
compounded by my 85th April birthday. We try to avoid saying the word, 
&quot;old...&quot;</p> 
<p>Before anything else, including the most beautiful scenery one could hope 
for, are the people of Pagosa which kept us there for nearly 18 years. We were 
productive citizens as health permitted. Let's hope the current population 
keeps the faith, enjoys the snow along with the brilliant sunshine and says a 
&quot;hi&quot; to everyone.</p> 
<p>Thanks again,</p> 
<p>Doris G. Hudson</p> 
<p><b>Forward looking</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I wish to thank all the forward looking citizens who took the time to 
become informed and vote for our hospital. The turnout for a Special District 
Election was very healthy; and I was impressed at the number of people who 
waited in line; and also those who came back after seeing the long line to make 
sure that their voice was heard.</p> 
<p>The overwhelming support, not only from the voters, but also from all the 
citizens who donated their time and money toward this cause is very 
heartwarming. There are just too many participants to mention them all. In 
addition there were many local businesses who contributed with services and 
spreading the word.</p> 
<p>I know that the board, their committees and all the volunteers will now do 
everything possible to ensure that your trust is rewarded by building and 
operating the best hospital a small town can have. This is a real leap forward 
in medical care for our community that was started many years ago by 
foresighted individuals and previous boards. We owe them a big thanks too.</p> 
<p>I hope to see many of you at the opening of our hospital in the fall of 
2007.</p> 
<p>Jim Knoll</p> 
<p><b>No respect</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>We are going to have growth and progress in our area, but it needs to be 
with respect to the residents. Nothing respectful about the town going ahead 
with plans showing ranches swallowed up, homes gone, or businesses no longer 
there. Nothing respectful about plans to put in a Wal-Mart when the moratorium 
is lifted come June. Are those plans on Tamra's desk? Nothing respectful about 
BootJack Management's last-minute request to increase density in a residential 
area. Nothing respectful about pushing residents or small business persons 
around because you want their property.</p> 
<p>How does the town planning and council approve developers' plans when the 
property is in the county? This is happening with Todd and Doug Shelton at Rock 
Ridge Mobile Home Park where they wish to build houses. Will it be rushed 
through annexation now? Thursday, May 11, at noon, is a town council meeting.
</p> 
<p>How do they go against the recommendations of CDOT on the increased traffic 
at 160 and Great West? Where does the county planning and BOCC stand on this 
project? Developers want a second entrance/exit for the project in the Rock 
Ridge area. Why should Alpha/Rock Ridge Metro District pay for more traffic on 
their roads? Why is the town going to pave almost one mile, as a &quot;gesture 
of good will,&quot; more of Great West than first planned several years ago? 
They were to pave only in front of Rock Ridge commercial. Odd that this paving 
project now goes to a point just beyond where developers want that second 
entrance to come through. Highland Springs developers want a road coming into 
Alpha from behind the grade school area. This will create even more traffic at 
160 and Great West, as well as within the metro district.</p> 
<p>Properties in Alpha/Rock Ridge are three, five and 10 acres with a rural 
feel. That is why we live there and want to keep it that way. No one has the 
right to drastically change the value of your property to benefit a developer's 
pocket. If you think this does not affect you, think again. Will someone plan a 
road through properties on South Pagosa Boulevard? Meadows? Piedra Estates? 
Holiday Acres? Continental Estates? Once a road is put in, they will want to 
connect the dots with other roads and keep tearing away at open spaces.</p> 
<p>Maybe an attorney needs to check to see if what they are doing is truly 
legal. There are too many items being rushed through a broken system without 
showing respect to those area residents. Some developers go through the right 
motions, but maybe that is just that &#138; motions and lip service. Ever hear 
of baffle them with BS?</p>

<p><b>Some brakes</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>When I was growing up in the Northwest, my brother and I shared a sled. The 
kind with wood slats and narrow steel runners. The main thing to know about our 
sled was that it had no brakes. You only got to decide where you were going, 
not if.</p> 
<p>Archuleta County's growth is a lot like riding that sled. All steering, no 
brakes. There will be growth here. There will be development here. But where we 
end up is still up to us.</p> 
<p>On Monday night, Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners took a big 
step by approving our first Land Use Code. The Board of County Commissioners, 
the County Planning Commission, and the Office of County Development 
(Planning), have for several months been soliciting help from consultants, 
ranchers, developers, and many other citizens in the arduous process of writing 
this Code. I have personally been to every meeting, and the process has been 
very transparent and responsive to input. The new Land Use Code is how we will 
steer toward our future. It will enable us to guide what kind of growth we have 
and where.</p> 
<p>The trick with land use codes is to encourage and reward excellence, 
whether it is in development, in agriculture, or land preservation, while 
protecting us all from bad neighbors and preserving some of our rural heritage. 
Also, a Land Use Code, like all governance, should create balance. Fairness.</p>
<p>The Code will provide a necessary counterbalance to the tremendous force of 
development. High land values force developers outward from towns to create 
affordable and profitable developments. Meanwhile, it is nearly impossible for 
people struggling to stay in agricultural production to say no to thousands of 
dollars an acre to sell their land. The only way a landowner is able to use the 
full value of their land is to sell it. That is bad for everyone.</p> 
<p>That is why I applaud the BoCC and Planning Commission, not only for their 
incredibly hard work in creating and enacting the Land Use Code, but also for 
including Scenic and Wildlife Overlays and Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) 
language in the Code. Overlays and TDRs have been combined as an incentive-only 
and market-based program to encourage and compensate landowners and developers 
for preserving some agricultural and open lands.</p> 
<p>In the past, being in an Overlay District meant extra regulation and no net 
benefit to the landowner. Our Code does just the opposite. If we are going to 
tell landowners that their land is important to the rest of us by putting them 
in a Scenic or Wildlife Overlay District, then we should back that up by giving 
them more value for their land. The more valuable the land is to the community, 
the greater the compensation should be. The new Overlay/TDR program has few 
restrictions or &quot;hoops&quot; to get through. It will provide a voluntary 
opportunity to get greater value out of your land by keeping it agricultural.
</p> 
<p>Whether you are a person working to keep your ranch operating, or see that 
same ranch as an incredibly beautiful view, or you are an elk hunter, fly 
fisher, or want clean drinking water for your kids, everyone benefits when the 
land stays open and productive.</p> 
<p>I encourage everyone to read the code, ask questions, and suggest changes, 
as the next steps in the process begin and continue.</p>

<p><b>Help with Fiesta</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>On behalf of the Spanish Fiesta Club we would like to thank everyone who 
attended our dinner and dance on Friday, Cinco de Mayo, the pi&ntilde;ata party 
on Saturday and the Mariachis on Sunday. It was also a great reminder of how 
important it is for all of us to keep the traditions that were started 25 years 
ago alive in our community.</p> 
<p>There will be a reorganizational meeting for the Spanish Fiesta Club on 
Wednesday, May 17, at the community center at 6:30 p.m. The Spanish Fiesta Club 
gives three scholarships to local high school students annually. We must 
continue to celebrate our cultures that seem to be slowly getting lost. If you 
are interested in helping revive what was once a great chance to see, learn and 
hear the traditions that many of our residents grew up with, in Pagosa Springs 
and the surrounding areas, come help us get this going again. Remember the 
parade, the dance, the party in the park, the excitement that we once had? It 
can be done again with your help, if not there may be a chance it will be gone 
and lost forever. Let's be proud of our heritage and where we came from.</p> 
<p>For more information contact Inez Lobato-Winter at 264-2740 or 946-2288, 
Laurie Echavarria at 759-9913 or Theresa Lucero at 264-4534.</p> 
<p>Please remember that this is for the children in our community. We need to 
help them with their future education dreams. We hope to see you at our meeting 
on May 17.</p>

<p><b>Shelter anniversary, plans made for new facility </b></p> 
<p><b>By Robbie Schwartz</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>A group of volunteers lead by Debra Rinker-Brown founded The Humane Society 
of Pagosa Springs in 1983 and raised the funds to build and open the current 
shelter May 3, 1986.</p> 
<p>As the county of Archuleta and the town of Pagosa Springs have grown, so 
has the population of the dogs and cats in the community.</p> 
<p>The Humane Society of Pagosa Springs is the only animal welfare 
organization for dogs and cats in Pagosa Springs and Archuleta County. The 
Society's purpose is to provide a safe haven for animals in need, promote 
adoptions, reunite lost animals with their owners and to humanely reduce pet 
overpopulation through community education and aggressive spay and neuter 
programs. </p> 
<p>The organization is a nonprofit, charitable tax-exempt corporation directed 
by a board of elected volunteers. The Humane Society is audited every three 
years and is in excellent financial health. Operating costs are covered through 
sales at our thrift store, private donations, fund-raising events, grants from 
private foundations and fees from the town and county for impounding services 
provided.</p> 
<p>As with any small or large town humane society there have been many 
accomplishments and goals have been achieved throughout the years.</p>

<p>2007-2008 - Phase two of shelter project.</p> 
<p>2008-2009 - Phase three of shelter project.</p> 
<p>If you have visited our current shelter, it would not come as a surprise 
that our existing facility is outdated and we are out of space for future 
expansion. One of the biggest challenges of an animal shelter is to avoid cross 
contamination of new animals arriving with current residents or having to move 
an aggressive 130-pound dog from one kennel to another for cleaning. We have 
been in need of a new shelter for several years.</p> 
<p><b>The need</b></p> 
<p>There are many reasons why a new animal shelter must be built at a 
different location:</p> 
<p>- The land on which the current animal shelter was built is less than an 
acre.</p> 
<p>- The size of the water line is inadequate for the water pressure needs of 
an animal shelter.</p> 
<p>- The septic system, a septic lagoon, is already at capacity and cannot 
handle a larger load.</p> 
<p>- The location of the existing shelter has become a desirable residential 
district and homeowners are applying pressure to get the animal shelter to move.
</p> 
<p>- The location is inconvenient for the public.</p> 
<p>- The gravel road servicing the animal shelter is in poor shape most of the 
year and impassible during periods of rain and snow.</p> 
<p>- The overcrowding of the pets at the shelter causes excessive noise and 
high stress on the animals. Stress affects the health of the animals and 
increases susceptibility to disease.</p> 
<p>- Current conditions provide a poor environment for encouraging adoptions.
</p> 
<p>- Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation Department is expanding the storage 
capability of Stevens Lake Reservoir and needs our property for this project.
</p> 
<p><b>To date</b></p> 
<p>In 2000, 11.25 acres was purchased in the Cloman Industrial Park and paid 
for by two private donors. The property is easily accessible via the 
well-maintained Cloman Boulevard and is already tapped into municipal water and 
sewer.</p> 
<p>In order to expedite our move, the board and the building committee have 
decided to proceed in phases.</p> 
<p>Phase One: Construct at Cloman property a 50x60 metal building that would 
serve as a temporary shelter to house all incoming and adoptable animals. Move 
pole barn to house crematorium.</p> 
<p>Phase Two: Construct block building to house all adoptable animals. At this 
point, the metal shelter will become an isolation ward for all incoming animals.
</p> 
<p>Phase Three: Create memorial garden, walking trails and bark park.</p> 
<p><b>Architectural plans </b> </p> 
<p>We enlisted the architectural services of Animal Arts to design a 
state-of-the art shelter. The plans for phase two, which are now complete, will 
meet the projected animal sheltering needs for the next 10 years and allow for 
future expansion. In addition to providing more space, the new shelter will 
keep animals healthier, make animal care easier, offer improved impound and 
isolation areas and provide critical rehabilitation space for those needing 
time to adjust or heal. The new facility will also provide space for education 
and training and be much more inviting to the public when they come to the 
shelter to adopt a new pet. </p> 
<p>The town and county are relying on the Humane Society to maintain a 
facility that can handle all impounded pets. As the community has grown, stray 
and nuisance animals have increased. In recent years, property owners have put 
pressure on the town and county to allocate more resources for animal control. 
As a result, more pets and strays are being impounded and, as a result of our 
aggressive spay and neuter programs, the organization is struggling to keep up 
with demand at our current location. </p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs is entering a new phase in its growth and development. 
Leaders, businesses and private individuals are working to maximize Pagosa's 
potential as a place to visit and a place to live. How a community treats its 
lost and homeless pets is a factor in its lifestyle rating. A state-of-the-art 
animal shelter will be an asset to our community and will provide a safe 
educational environment for the residents of Archuleta County to visit or enjoy 
with their pets.</p> 
<p><b>Community choir concerts this weekend </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sue Diffee</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Community Choir will present its fourth annual spring 
concert - &quot;I'm Gonna Sing&quot; - Friday, May 12 and Saturday, May 13, at 
7 p.m., and Sunday, May 14, at 4 p.m.</p> 
<p>Included in the program will be &quot;Jubilate,&quot; &quot;American Folk 
Rhapsody&quot; with soloist Matthew Brunson, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; with 
soloist Tiffany Brunson, &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Poor 
Wayfarin' Stranger&quot; with soloist Larry Baisdon, &quot;Do You Feel the 
Rhythm?,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Sing&quot; and &quot;This Little Light of 
Mine.&quot;</p> 
<p>Baked goods will be available for purchase after each concert. </p> 
<p>A Christmas choir was started by Carroll (Doc) Carruth in 1989. It evolved 
into the Pagosa Springs Community Choir, a non-profit organization which 
provides two free performances each year. The choir hosts a monthly sing-a-long 
at Pine Ridge Extended Care Center and repeats the concert for those who were 
unable to attend. Members of the choir have been invited to sing with 
&quot;Music in the Mountains&quot; in Durango this summer.</p> 
<p>The choir size varies from 65 to 95 local volunteers under the direction of 
Pam Spitler and Larry Elginer, accompanied by Melinda Baum.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in joining the choir, contact Sue Diffee at 731-1305 
or Pam Spitler at 264-1952. The only requirements are a love of singing, 
carrying a tune and a dedication to weekly rehearsals. Schedules will be 
announced in The PREVIEW for three weeks prior to the beginning of rehearsals 
and will be posted online at www.pagosachoir.org. Rehearsals for the Christmas 
concert will begin in early September.</p> 
<p>As always, the choir is pleased to provide free admission for this program 
as its gift to the community. The group gratefully accepts any donations, which 
are tax deductible.</p> 
<p><b>Children's Chorale brings home first-place trophies </b></p> 
<p><b>By Anna Harbison</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Seventeen members of the Dolce Cantare choir, one of two Pagosa Springs 
Children's Chorale choirs, traveled to Denver last weekend to compete with 
nearly 1,700 young musicians from seven states at &quot;Music in the 
Parks.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cantare singers range in age from 8 to 16 and have been in rehearsal since 
January for this event and for the upcoming spring concert to be presented at 3 
p.m. May 13, at the high school auditorium.</p> 
<p>Musical selections - &quot;I Am Being Woven&quot; and &quot;May You Always 
Have A Song&quot; - were adjudicated by Dr. Galen Darrough, vocal department 
chair at the University of Northern Colorado, and Mike Kornelsen, director of 
choral activities at Metropolitan State College.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs' Cantare, the only &quot;community ensemble&quot; which 
competed, received a Superior rating of 93.5 out of 100, which was the highest 
score in their division. They also were awarded the judges' Over-All trophy, 
acknowledging their musical achievement in their division, which included seven 
public school choirs from Colorado Springs, Gilpin County, Leadville, Alamosa, 
Casper, Cheyenne and Laramie.</p> 
<p>Director Sue Anderson, a 20-plus-year choral director veteran, is no 
stranger to Superior ratings for her choirs and ensembles. In 1999 and 2000, as 
Pagosa Springs Junior High School choir director, she brought home Superior 
ratings and the Judge's Choice trophy as well. While those choirs averaged 
50-60 voices, this treble choir of 17 voices demonstrated it is not the size of 
the choir, but musical finesse that impresses the judges.</p> 
<p>Choir members include Soprano I: Hope Forman, Johanna Laverty, Mariah 
Mondragon, Johanna Patterson and Breanna Voorhis; Soprano II: Madelyn Davey, 
Alex Fortney, Melinda Fultz, Brooke Hampton, Abby Hicklin, Desi Pastin, Shannon 
Rogers and Lark Sanders; Alto: Leslie Baughman, Megan Davey, Kitman Gill, Ami 
Harbison and Jordyn Morelock.</p> 
<p><b>Bruce Hayes to perform in Pagosa </b></p> 
<p>Bruce Hayes performs in a 6:30 p.m. house concert May 20 at the Karas house 
in Holiday Acres.</p> 
<p>Hayes is no stranger to Pagosa, or to the Colorado music scene. He 
performed and recorded on the first String Cheese Incident and Acoustic 
Junction releases. He tours relentlessly, often accompanying these acts as well 
as Three Twins (former subdudes) and Leftover Salmon. His last band, Ragged 
Mountain, was active on the Colorado club scene and festival circuit.</p> 
<p>Performing as a solo act, a sideman or with his various bands, Hayes has 
given over 3,000 performances in many of America's finest music venues 
including The Fox Theater-Boulder, The Berkshire Performing Arts Center, The 
Great American Music Hall-San Francisco, and at several prominent music 
festivals. His music has taken him across the continent a dozen times, and 
twice around Europe. He's jammed on stage with Joe Cocker, Arlo Guthrie and New 
Riders; opened shows for David Bromberg, Jorma Kaukonen, Merle Sanders, 
subdudes, Dave Mathews and David Lindley; and recorded in Nashville for 
Grammy-winning producer, Jon Vezner.</p> 
<p>To reach the Karas house, take U.S. 84 to Holiday Drive. Go one block to 
Stagecoach, turn right, then turn left on Shenandoah. Drive one block to 
Peregrine Place, turn left, and the Karas house is at 160 Peregrine Place, the 
second driveway on the left - a cream-colored, earth-berm passive solar 
structure.</p> 
<p><b>Monthly dance at center on the horizon </b></p>

the dance, there will be a catered fajitas buffet with all the trimmings. Our 
plans for the dinner and dance are currently being firmed up and details will 
be printed in The PREVIEW the next few weeks. </p> 
<p>The community center dances are a wonderful way to have an affordable 
evening out on the town. They are usually scheduled the third Friday of the 
month. We begin setup and decorating at 9 a.m. the day of the dance, and we 
would love to have anyone interested come down and help.</p>

<p><b>Register now for Pretenders Summer Drama Camp </b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pretenders are excited to announce their first Summer Drama 
Camp. Open to students going into fourth grade, up to 12th-graders, this camp 
promises to introduce, challenge and develop acting skills in every age group.
</p> 
<p>It begins Tuesday, May 30, continuing through Saturday, June 3, for a 
fun-filled week of dramatic instruction.</p> 
<p>Classes will be offered each day 8:30 a.m. to noon at Pagosa Springs High 
School. Students will attend classes in voice, improvisation and 
monologue/scene studies.</p> 
<p>The Pretenders are producing this drama camp with money receive from an El 
Pomar Foundation Award. &quot;The timing is perfect,&quot; said Pretenders 
president Susan Garman. &quot;This drama camp fills a need in our community. We 
have many students who want to be involved in theatre, but do not have any 
place to acquire the skills to be successful. We're very excited about being 
able to provide that place.&quot;</p> 
<p>Classes and their instructors are as follow:</p> 
<p>Improvisation will be taught by Jon Bernard, a graduate of the Pacific 
Conservatory for the Performing Arts in Californian Bernard also studied the 
Sanford Meisner approach to acting for several years. He is passionate in his 
belief that &quot;acting stems from instinct and tuition.&quot; The 
Improvisation class will offer creative activities to inspire young actors to 
develop characters and relationships with other characters on stage.</p> 
<p>Voice will be taught by Darcy Downing and will explore the actor's voice as 
an instrument. Students will develop their voices theatrically and musically 
through the study of breathing techniques, articulation, projection and volume. 
Downing received her formal training at Adams State College. While the roots of 
her training lie in classical music, she understands and enjoys experimenting 
with voice, writing music and encouraging others to sing and speak loudly.</p> 
<p>Felica Lansbury Meyer will teach Monologue and Scene Studies. Trained as an 
actress at New York University, and receiving her M.F.A. in film directing from 
The American Film Institute, she has worked as an actress in theatre and 
television, including a role last march in &quot;Skins,&quot; the acclaimed 
production at La Mama E.T.C. in New York City. In February of this year she 
taught an acting course at Fort Lewis College. Monologue and Scene Studies will 
hone acting skills such as memorization, characterization, dialogue and 
scene-blocking. Actors will be practicing monologues in class.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pretenders Family Theatre is known for its spontaneous 
productions such as &quot;2001: A Space Oddity&quot; and &quot;Escape to 
Broadway.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Lack of something like this was brought our attention early last 
fall,&quot; says Pretenders secretary Sean Downing. &quot;This camp is just the 
sort of thing we need to sustain interest in theatre here in Pagosa, and to 
give kids the tools they need to begin a lifelong enjoyment of the performing 
arts.&quot;</p> 
<p>Registration for the camp is $95 with some scholarships (which pay 50 
percent of the cost) available.</p> 
<p>For more information, contact Garman at 731-2485 before May 15. </p>

<p><b>Fiber festival a boon to economy </b></p> 
<p><b>By Pauline Benetti</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>This will be the sixth year of the Pagosa Fiber Festival. </p> 
<p>What began as an event conceived of and sponsored by one family - the Belt 
family of Echo Mountain Alpaca - has moved into the non-profit world with a 
board of directors. The festival is also now permanently settled into the 
Memorial Day weekend date, May 27-28.</p> 
<p>For a second year, the festival will sponsor a Navajo rug auction Sunday 
evening at 6 p.m. with registration beginning at 5. New events this year 
include two competitions: one in fiber arts and the other in hand-spun yarns.
</p> 
<p>Anyone involved in the non-profit world will understand how this festival 
depends on the effort and devotion of a few hardworking people, the support and 
generosity of our community and an occasional grant. It is appropriate, then, 
that our community understands how the festival is good for Pagosa.</p> 
<p>Enterprise zone marketing funds have come to us through Region 9 Economic 
Development District of Southwest Colorado, and it is their report that helps 
demonstrate the value of the Festival.</p> 
<p>The Region 9 Report-2003 tells us that &quot;Economic diversification is a 
high priority for the Region.&quot; The diversity is needed &quot;to improve 
the number, quality and variety of jobs that are available to local 
residents.&quot;</p> 
<p>The fiber festival meets that need by supporting the efforts of a growing 
cottage industry involved in fiber-related businesses. Whether raising animals 
for breeding, sale and fiber production (alpacas, llamas, goats, sheep and 
rabbits) or working their fibers (spinning, weaving, knitting, felting, 
designing patterns) to make products for sale, these people are helping to 
diversify economic activity in the area.</p> 
<p>As we all know, employment economies in Archuleta are currently based 
primarily on tourism, construction and retail trade. At the same time, 
according to the Region 9 report, &quot;The preservation of a rural lifestyle 
and landscape has been identified as priorities in all discussions of economic 
development in the region.&quot; Once again, the fiber festival supports that 
priority by providing the small livestock farmers a venue to promote their 
products, thus making a rural lifestyle economically feasible. </p> 
<p>The Pagosa Fiber Festival is a perfect fit for the community at this 
critical juncture in its history. We are in a frenzy of development activity 
right now; large ranches are being bought up with plans to turn open grazing 
land and forested mountains into home sites. Empty lots are being bought up 
with plans for spec houses in the works. Community planning committees have 
produced a Comprehensive Plan in an attempt to insure that Pagosa Springs does 
not lose its quaint and rural aspect - that quality many of us came here for 
and that quality that continues to bring tourists to our area.</p> 
<p>The community will benefit as the festival grows and the festival needs 
community support to grow. Our goal is to attract crowds the size of the Taos 
Wool Festival, estimated at 3-5,000 in 2005. The Taos event is now totally 
self-supporting with vendors bringing in $50,000-$60,000 in sales. A percentage 
of that goes directly to the town and county coffers as sales tax revenues. 
Here the town and county's gain is directly related to the size and success of 
the festival.</p> 
<p>Organizers of the festival want to put Pagosa Springs on the map as a 
center of wool and fiber production, processing and handcrafts. The interest in 
spinning, weaving, knitting, etc. is already here, and is growing by leaps and 
bounds. The farmers have been here for a very long time and in 2004 fiber 
processing began with the establishment of the Mountain High Fiber Ladies 
Mini-mill. All the elements are present. We are looking for people of vision 
who realize the potential and will work with us to realize that potential.</p> 
<p>Here is a flavor of what goes on during the two days of the festival:</p> 
<p>- Half-day and full-day training workshops in beginning and advanced 
spinning, weaving, knitting, felting, dyeing, locker hooking and color theory.
</p> 
<p>- Lectures on the care and maintenance of small livestock.</p> 
<p>- Livestock farmers exhibiting and selling alpacas, llamas, sheep, goats, 
Scottish Highlander Cattle, Yak and Fuzzy French Lops.</p> 
<p>- Shearing of sheep and goats throughout the day.</p> 
<p>- Fiber artists selling a variety of outstanding handmade textiles and 
articles of clothing.</p> 
<p>- Spinners demonstrating how to card, sort and spin fiber.</p> 
<p>- Knitters, crocheters, weavers, and felters demonstrating how to utilize 
the finished yarn.</p> 
<p>- A fashion show at the end of each day illustrating the theme &quot;From 
Fleece to Fashion.&quot;</p> 
<p>- Families with young children viewing and touching the animals, a unique 
and educational experience to be found nowhere else.</p> 
<p>New this year:</p> 
<p>- Fiber arts competition: Fiber artists will enter their prize creations, 
offering the public a view of wonderfully handcrafted pieces of clothing and 
home accessories.</p> 
<p>- Yarn competition: Fiber artists will enter hand-spun yarns of every 
style, color and natural material imaginable, in either advanced or novice 
classes.</p>

<p><b>Music of Slambovia at Indiefest </b></p> 
<p><b>By Crista Munro</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>With 10 successful Four Corners Folk Festivals behind them, the FolkWest 
board of directors decided it was time to create a new cultural opportunity in 
Southwest Colorado and Indiefest was born.</p> 
<p>Tapping into the popularity of independent musicians that's been fueled to 
great degree by the Internet, Indiefest will deliver 10 top-notch sets over two 
days from a diverse collection of artists.</p> 
<p>The inaugural event will take place June 10 and 11 on Reservoir Hill here 
in Pagosa Springs. Offerings also include a kids program, arts and crafts 
vending, on-site camping and more.</p> 
<p>In 1998 Gandalf Murphy and the Slambovian Circus of Dreams (try fitting 
that one on a festival poster!) emerged from the misty hills of Sleepy Hollow, 
N.Y., and exploded upon the Hudson Valley music scene with their stunning 
self-produced debut release, &quot;A Good Thief Tips His Hat.&quot; The quirky 
quartet then began touring throughout the Northeast and rapidly developed a 
fiercely loyal, all-ages following.</p> 
<p>The band has been featured recently in Relix Magazine, The New York Times 
and on the CBS hit show, Joan of Arcadia. With a sound that toes the line 
between Tom Petty and electric Bob Dylan with a smattering of Greg Brown and a 
twist of Celtic rhythms thrown in for good measure, the band's charismatic live 
performances and whimsical blend of folk, rock, hillbilly and pop have 
captivated audiences and critics alike.</p> 
<p>Their much-celebrated newest release &quot;Flapjacks from the Sky&quot; has 
garnered high praise from music writers, sparked generous activity at radio 
stations across the country, and continues to invoke wave after wave of 
enthusiastic response from music fans worldwide.</p> 
<p>The music of Slambovia has been described as &quot;Hillbilly-Floyd, 
folk-pop,&quot; &quot;alt-country roots-rock&quot; and &quot;surreal 
Americana.&quot; Yet as earthy as their music seems, The Circus has a spiritual 
side - &quot;Talkin' to the Buddha,&quot; &quot;Call to the Mystic,&quot; 
&quot;Living with God&quot; and &quot;Flapjacks from the Sky&quot; dance freely 
between religious and philosophical mythologies. Gandalf Murphy's music is not 
only uplifting and empowering, but fun. And, as Woody Guthrie once said: 
&quot;It's not enough for a song to be good, it must be good for 
something.&quot;</p> 
<p>Gandalf Murphy and the Slambovian Circus of Dreams will take the stage 
Sunday, June 11 on Reservoir Hill. </p> 
<p>Two-day or single day tickets for the festival are on sale at Moonlight 
Books. Children 12 and under are admitted free with an accompanying adult. To 
purchase tickets with a credit card, or for additional information, call 
731-5582 or visit www.folkwest.com.</p> 
<p><b>Two Pagosa artists in Farmington national show </b> </p> 
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs artist Linda Echterhoff received an honorable mention in the 
&quot;Gateway to Imagination&quot; National Juried Art Competition at the 
Farmington Museum and Visitor's Center at Gateway Park. The $50 award was for 
her mixed media work, &quot;Seed Pod&quot; an organic floral structure made of 
cardboard, fiber pulp and packing tape.</p> 
<p>Juror Jill Chancey, curator of the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in Laurel, 
Miss., said of Echterhoff's sculpture: &quot;I like this because it is a 
floral, but it's scruffy. It's sturdy, not delicate. I like the contrast 
between subject matter and material. It's very clever.&quot;</p> 
<p>A Ph.D. candidate, the soon-to-be Dr. Chancey completed her dissertation on 
the abstract expressionist painter Elaine De Kooning. Her interest in abstract 
expressionism explains why Chancey selected another Pagosa Springs artist - 
Kathy Steventon. Steventon's oil painting of a cow, &quot;Standing Gaze,&quot; 
was chosen for it's strong, visceral texture and painterly technique. &quot;How 
can you not love a picture of a cow?&quot; Chancey said.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, Chancey chose few other works that could be considered 
abstract expressionism for the Gateway show. However, my personal favorites in 
this vein were both works by New York artist Ha Rhin Kim: &quot;Rotte Tree 
2005-11&quot; and &quot;Rotte Tree 2005-03.&quot; These abstract figurative 
works are black and white with shades of gray; only the black is almost purple. 
The work is acrylic painted on white Mylar. The Mylar provides a vitreous 
quality to the opaque areas of paint, which contrasts with the crisp, fine 
lines of organic forms that look like the veins of leaves.</p> 
<p>The Gateway to Imagination show is all over the place. It features 
traditional landscape painting, plein aire work in big gilded frames, 
contemporary painting, quite a bit of different photography, some digital 
prints, some bronze and ceramic sculpture, some pottery, a fiber quilted wall 
hanging, some metal art, a piece of silver jewelry and a lot of diverse 
painting from figurative, to abstract, from oil to pastel to acrylic and water 
media.</p> 
<p>&quot;Not everyone is going to agree with my choices,&quot; Chancey said, 
but then added: &quot;The prize winners are of such clear quality that anyone 
would have picked them.&quot;</p> 
<p>Quality? Yes. I'll agree with her on that point. But as I walked around 
viewing the work, considering what Chancey told me about her selection process. 
I found myself disagreeing.</p> 
<p>Chancey made 105 selections from 342 submissions based on her belief that a 
successful work of art has two components: an interesting idea and successful 
execution. She said she was looking for &quot;aesthetic quality and some 
evidence that the artist was thinking about something when creating the art. 
Good art represents an aesthetic resolution.&quot;</p> 
<p>More than that, she deemed work to be most successful that expressed the 
idea of the past as part of one's present identity, of ancestor's traveling 
with us as we move forward. &quot;The U.S. is a nation full of immigrants and 
their descendants; several artist refer explicitly to their immigrant heritage, 
while other draw on Native heritage,&quot; Chancey wrote in her statement.</p> 
<p>I agreed with her selection for Best of Show: &quot;The Passage&quot; by 
Gil Bruvel of Wimberley, Texas. Bruvel's work is highly skilled. &quot;The 
Passage&quot; is a bronze sculpture of a female head representing the ocean and 
atop her head is a boat and in the boat is an armored man riding the waves. The 
patina is a gorgeous blue and the face is exquisite. This sculptor has not only 
mastered technique and aesthetic, but explores ideas and communicates those 
ideas to the viewer. As Chancey said of Bruvel's work: &quot;He has such a 
unique vision. I've never seen anything like this and the execution is 
excellent.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bruvel's other sculpture, &quot;Mask of Whispers&quot; is a stainless steel 
female head, bound with other faces cut out and protruding from windows in the 
forehead and cheek. Bruvel manages this without stimulating the grotesque. The 
female face is beautiful, but bound by susurration.</p> 
<p>I also liked her first-place winner: &quot;Cherries Under Ice&quot; by 
Janet Collins, Sedona, Ariz. The detailed colored-pencil drawing looked more 
like a photograph or a pastel painting than colored pencil. And the light 
glinting off the melting ice, dripping off the cherry is very nice. But this 
was a straightforward drawing of cherries covered in ice. I didn't see the 
artist pushing any boundaries or exploring any interesting ideas. It was simply 
masterful execution.</p> 
<p>&quot;Cherries Under Ice&quot; did not fit in with her other top picks, 
which all expressed the idea that the past is always a part of one's present 
identity, ancestors travel with us as we move forward. &quot;The U.S. is a 
nation of immigrants and their descendants; several artists refer explicitly to 
their immigrant heritage, while other draw on Native heritage,&quot; Chancey 
wrote in her juror's statement.</p> 
<p>Her second-place winner, &quot;Immigrant,&quot; by Barbara Giorgio, Selma, 
Ind., and her third-place winner, &quot;Missed Fortune,&quot; by Veronica Day, 
Morris, Conn. both explore this theme using photographic techniques. Giorgio's 
work is a digital print while Day's work is a palladium print.</p> 
<p>I found myself drawn to diverse works. In color photography, I loved 
&quot;Fish Wanting to Fly,&quot; by Jefferey Jue, Oakland, Calif., a playful, 
yet thought provoking and brilliantly executed photograph. For movement and 
texture I liked &quot;Annexation of Control&quot; by Jennifer Peel, Tyler, 
Texas, graphite and latex paint on paper mounted on canvas. For whimsy, David 
Edgar's &quot;Bluetail Reef Cruiser&quot; and &quot;Goggle-Eyed Swallow 
Tail,&quot; fish made from recycled plastic containers. I found myself 
transfixed by the aboriginal detail and maze-like paths in &quot;Satellite 
781,&quot; an acrylic and ink composition by Julie King, Nacogdoches, Texas. 
And I kept coming back to &quot;Unified Theory of Forces&quot; by Nancy 
Pollock, Santa Fe, a layered canvas of oil paint with a tree in a box on the 
left side of the canvas and mathematical formulas peeking through layers of 
paint are.</p> 
<p>The Gateway show is an interesting collection of work from 85 artists in 28 
states. I suppose, given the name of the show, &quot;Gateway to 
Imagination,&quot; I was hoping for more works that challenged existing 
concepts and ideas, for works that pushed the boundaries. I think that is why I 
liked the work of Ha Rhin Kim - because I'm not exactly sure how the artist 
achieved the technique.</p> 
<p>However, I felt Chancey's focus on immigration, a hot political issue, 
influenced her choices more than the aesthetic resolution of the work. Perhaps 
immigration is on many artists' minds, or perhaps in the difficult challenge of 
trying to rank diverse works of art, she grabbed at a theme and used it to 
award prizes.</p> 
<p>Gateway to Imagination is on display through July 15, at the Farmington 
Museum and Visitor's Center at Gateway Park, 3041 East Main Street, Farmington, 
N.M. (505) 599-1174. Hours: are Monday to Saturday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.</p>

<p><b>A response to critics of Freemasonry </b></p> 
<p><b>By Bob Case</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Most of the issues surrounding Freemasonry deal with language, in one way 
or another.</p> 
<p>Almost every organization has a special vocabulary of words which are 
understood by the group. It's hardly appropriate for someone outside a group, 
and without the special knowledge of the group, to object to the terms unless 
he or she full understands them and why they are used.</p> 
<p>If someone wants to read the Journal of the American Medical Association, 
that is his right; but he doesn't have a right to complain that the articles 
use medical terms. A person reading a cookbook had better know terms like fold, 
cream the butter, or soft ball have special meanings, or he'll make a mess 
instead of a cake.</p> 
<p>The same is true of a non-Mason reading Masonic materials.</p> 
<p><b>Offensive titles</b> </p> 
<p>Some don't understand the historic source of the terms used in Freemasonry. 
</p> 
<p>They complain of &quot;offensive&quot; titles, such as &quot;worshipful 
master&quot; for the leader of a lodge. This is simply a matter of 
misunderstanding. The leader of the lodge is called Master of the Lodge for the 
same reason the leader of an orchestra is called the concert master, or a 
highly skilled electrician is called a master electrician, or the leader of a 
scout troop is called a scoutmaster.</p> 
<p>Masonic use of the term &quot;master&quot; originated in the guilds of the 
Middle Ages when the person most skilled was called master, Much Masonic 
vocabulary dates from that period. For instance, &quot;worshipful&quot; is a 
term still used today. Worshipful John Doe means exactly the same thing as the 
Honorable John Doe. </p> 
<p><b>Archaic, offensive rituals</b></p> 
<p>There is nothing offensive in Masonic rituals. They are ancient but there 
is nothing bad in that. </p> 
<p>Rituals are present in our everyday life. Do courts use ritual opening and 
closing court sessions? Do boards of directors use a ritual in opening and 
closing their meeting? What about the opening and closing of the Olympics?</p> 
<p><b>Bloody oaths</b></p> 
<p>As to the allegedly &quot;bloody oaths,&quot; the historic penalties 
associated with the Masonic obligations have their origins in the legal system 
of medieval Europe and were actual punishments inflicted by the state on 
persons guilty of fighting for civil liberty and religious freedom.</p> 
<p>In Masonry, these penalties are entirely symbolic. They refer to the shame 
a good man should feel at the thought he had broken a promise, and they remind 
us of the price so many have paid for the liberties and freedoms Masons are 
pledged to protect.</p> 
<p>Next week, we'll explore paganism, the meaning of light, salvation by 
works, universalism and racial exclusion.</p> 
<p>Please come to the lodge open house, 3-5 p.m., May 20, 227 Lewis St., for 
answers to your questions. </p>

<p><b>A beautiful animated feature for the family</b></p> 
<p><b>By Charles Streetman</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>I thought that I'd take another look back and bring more attention to a 
little-known and overlooked animated film that was the runner up for the Oscar 
for Best Animated Feature at this year's Academy Awards - &quot;Howl's Moving 
Castle,&quot; based on the novel by author Dianna Wynn Jones.</p> 
<p>Written and directed by one of Japan's most gifted and innovative 
storytellers, Hayao Miyazaki, &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; continues to 
prove that Studio Ghibli is one of the most extraordinary animation studios in 
Japan.</p> 
<p>The story is centered around Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer, &quot;Match 
Point&quot;), a young girl working in her father's hat shop, who has a chance 
encounter with a handsome and mysterious stranger with a gift of magic, named 
Howl (voiced by Christian Bale, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;).</p> 
<p>Sophie falls head over heels for the young man, but she soon learns of the 
danger she's in, when the evil Witch of the Waste (voiced by Lauren Bacall, 
&quot;Birth&quot;) grows jealous of Sophie's attraction to Howl. The witch 
intrudes on the hat shop one night and places a curse upon Sophie, turning her 
into a 90-year-old woman (she is now voiced by actress Jean Simmons, &quot;The 
Dawning&quot;), and to make matters worse the curse forbids her from ever 
telling anyone about it.</p> 
<p>Horrified, Sophie sets out the following day into the Wastes to find a 
wizard who can break the curse. On her journey, she comes across wizard Howl's 
moving castle, a giant, lumbering mechanical beast that crawls across the 
countryside at great speeds. Reluctantly, she takes refuge in the castle. </p> 
<p>Inside she meets Calcifer (voiced by Billy Crystal, &quot;Analyze 
That&quot;), a smart-alecky fire demon residing in Howl's fireplace. He senses 
the curse cast upon Sophie and agrees to help her break it if she can find a 
way to help him break a spell that binds him and Howl together. She also meets 
and befriends Markl (voiced by Josh Hutcherson, &quot;Zathura&quot;), a young 
wizard in training and apprentice to Howl. Sophie decides to stay in the castle 
and serve as a new cleaning lady for Howl, hoping to find out more about 
Calcifer and Howl's spell and to see if they can lift her curse. While staying 
with Howl, Sophie learns of the agitation and struggle he faces with having to 
hide from the Witch of the Wastes' henchman, and to avoid serving on both sides 
in a war against two neighboring nations over the mysterious disappearance of a 
prince.</p> 
<p>Visually, Miyazaki's adaptation is a breathtaking experience! He continues 
to captivate us with Studio Ghibli's astonishingly detailed animation, as it 
entices us into yet another world alive with wondrous enchantment and charming 
characters, providing a true feeling of escape.</p> 
<p>The most incredible aspect of the animation in the film is the combination 
of computer-generated animation and cell animation used to bring the Howl's 
castle to life. The castle is unlike anything ever seen in film, and has as 
much of a unique personality as the rest of the cast. The exterior looks like a 
massive heap of scrap metal and steam pipes walking around on four legs, while 
the interior resembles a simple two-story house. Another part of the castle 
that's fascinating is the front door, as it serves as a magical portal to four 
different locations in the movie, including the Wastes.</p> 
<p>Since the movie was made in Japan, it's obvious that it was not originally 
in English, but Disney and Pixar Studios have done a terrific job in re-dubbing 
the whole film into English. The dialogue is well translated, and the English 
cast is well fitted with the characters, especially Billy Crystal providing the 
voice of Calcifer.</p> 
<p>Despite the extravagant animation, this is not Miyazaki's best film, 
especially when compared to some of his most recent masterpieces &quot;Spirited 
Away&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke.&quot; Having read the book just last 
summer, I can say that the film hardly follows the book at all. The story is a 
little offbeat and tends to get confusing at times. The ending as well has the 
problem of resolving everything too quickly, leaving some significant things 
left unsaid - such as whether or not Sophie was indeed a witch (as in the 
book). It's simply implied that she could be one. And as for the missing 
prince, when we learn of his whereabouts, we only know of what happened to him 
and not of who did it to him. Another problem that I felt would be that some of 
Miyazaki's artistic liberties in his adaptation seemed out of place at times. 
When the movie stops following the book and takes off on it's own adventure, I 
wondered at times whether I was watching &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; or 
&quot;Hayao's Moving Castle.&quot; However, Miyazaki somehow makes it all work 
and a makes it a thoroughly compelling story that remains somewhat true to the 
novel itself.</p> 
<p>&quot;Howl's Moving Castle's&quot; captivating story and gorgeous animation 
earned Hayao Miyazaki his second Oscar nomination. He was previously nominated 
for his masterpiece &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; which won the Academy Award for 
Best Animated Feature back in 2002. &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; did not 
earn Miyazaki his second win. Unfortunately, it lost to &quot;Wallace and 
Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; earlier this year. Regardless, this 
movie is a wonderful family film, and is one of the most beautiful animated 
features from 2005 you'll see.</p> 
<p>The DVD features on the two-disc edition of &quot;Howl's Moving 
Castle&quot; are plentiful. It contains several featurettes including 
interviews with the American voice cast of the film and the writers and 
director responsible for translating the film into English. The features 
include the original Japanese trailers. There is also a mini-documentary 
detailing Hayao Miyazaki's visit to Pixar Studios for one of the first U.S. 
premieres of the film, and a Japanese interview with director Pete Docter of 
Pixar Studios. Disc 2 of the special edition features the entire storyboard 
version of the film.</p>

<p>One afternoon, as I rummaged in the bookcase in the parlor looking for 
something to read, I came across a small book and a booklet that greatly 
influenced my thinking in the years to come. The book was, &quot;The Man 
Without a Country,&quot; written by Edward Everett Hale in 1863, and the other, 
&quot;A Message to Garcia,&quot; a 15-page booklet written by Elbert Hubbard.
</p> 
<p>Hale's book had to do with a navy lieutenant who said he never wanted to 
see his country again, and those who saw to it that he never did and how the 
man regretted his decision. It was written for the Americans of that day (it 
was Civil War time), and later used as a reading book in schools, where it was 
used to inspire leadership.</p> 
<p>The book inspired love of country in me. My family was patriotic. I was 
used to that, but the book made the feeling of love of country more so.</p> 
<p>The booklet, &quot;A Message to Garcia,&quot; was written in 1899 by the 
philosopher Elbert Hubbard. Maybe he was a modern day Benjamin Franklin.</p> 
<p>One of his sayings was, &quot;Folks who never get paid for any more than 
they do.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another saying was, &quot;When put to the test, an ounce of loyalty is 
worth a pound of cleverness.&quot;</p> 
<p>The booklet has to do with initiative and the story is an example of how a 
message needs to be delivered and one man being recommended for this duty. The 
man had the reputation for loyalty and taking the initiative.</p> 
<p>Some time during the past year, when I was watching the TV show, 
&quot;Jeopardy,&quot; a question was asked. I can't remember what it was, but I 
immediately knew the answer, for it referred to &quot;A Message to Garcia.&quot;
</p> 
<p>I have been told to hang onto &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; for it will 
probably be worth something one day. That's good! I've kept both book and 
booklet all these years.</p> 
<p>As Johnny Carson said, &quot;if it isn't broke, don't fix it.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Burma Shave signs are a good example.</p> 
<p>In the 1950s-1960s, the O'Dell brothers started a business making shaving 
cream. Their marketing system was simple. They put signs up in fields along the 
highways. The lines to the verses were spread among two or more signs and 
people would read them as they rode along.</p> 
<p>The signs entertained and the company profited, but when Phillip Morris 
bought the company, they dropped the signs and began advertising in NFL 
programs with TV ads a minute long. Each cost $150,000, but the fancy 
advertising failed.</p> 
<p>Here are some of the memorable Burma Shave signs:</p> 
<p>- Trains don't wander</p> 
<p>all over the map</p> 
<p>'cause nobody sits</p> 
<p>in the engineer's lap</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- She kissed the hairbrush</p> 
<p>by mistake</p> 
<p>She thought it was</p> 
<p>her husband Jake</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Cautious rider</p> 
<p>to her reckless dear</p> 
<p>Let's have less bull</p> 
<p>and more steer</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- The midnight ride</p> 
<p>of Paul for beer</p> 
<p>Let to a warmer</p> 
<p>Hemisphere</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Don't stick your elbow</p> 
<p>out so far</p> 
<p>It may go home</p> 
<p>in another car</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Brother speeders</p> 
<p>Let's rehearse</p> 
<p>All together</p> 
<p>Good morning hearse</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Don't lose your head to gain a minute,</p> 
<p>You need your head - your brains are in it.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Drove too long - driver snoozing</p> 
<p>What happened next is not amusing.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Brother speeder, let's rehearse</p> 
<p>All together - good morning nurse.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Speed was high - weather was not</p> 
<p>Tires were thin - X marks the spot.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Around the curve - lickety split</p> 
<p>It's a beautiful car - wasn't it?</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>No matter the price, no matter how new</p> 
<p>The best safety device in the car is you.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- A guy who drives a car wide open is not thinkin'</p> 
<p>He's just hopin'.</p> 
<p>- At intersections look each way</p> 
<p>A harp sounds nice but it's hard to play.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- Both hands on the wheel, both eyes on the road</p> 
<p>That's the skillful driver's code.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- The one who drives when he's been drinking</p> 
<p>Depends on you to do his thinking.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>Car in ditch - driver in tree</p> 
<p>The moon was full, and so was he.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p>- And here is my favorite:</p> 
<p>Passing school zone, take it slow</p> 
<p>Let our little shavers grow.</p> 
<p>Burma Shave</p> 
<p><b>Fun on the Run</b></p> 
<p>Passing the buck down the line .</p> 
<p>Said the college professor quite profoundly,</p> 
<p>&quot;Such rawness in a student is a shame.</p> 
<p>Lack of preparation in high school is to blame.&quot;</p> 
<p>Said one high school teacher to another,</p> 
<p>&quot;Good heavens, that boy's a fool,</p> 
<p>The fault, of course, is with the middle school.&quot;</p> 
<p>The middle school teacher almost cried,</p> 
<p>&quot;From such stupidity may I be spared.</p> 
<p>They sent him up to me so unprepared.&quot;</p> 
<p>The grammar school teacher in a huff shouted,</p> 
<p>&quot;Kindergarten blockhead sent to me.</p> 
<p>His lack of preparation is easy to see.&quot;</p> 
<p>The kindergarten teacher sadly noted,</p> 
<p>&quot;Such lack of training never did I see.</p> 
<p>What kind of woman must his mother be?&quot;</p> 
<p>The mother moaned as she held him tight,</p> 
<p>&quot;Poor helpless child, he's not to blame.&quot;</p> 
<p>His father's people were all the same.&quot;</p> 
<p>Said the father at the end of the line,</p> 
<p>&quot;I doubt that rascal's even mine!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Visit the community center, get involved </b></p> 
<p><b>By Becky Herman</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>How long has it been since you've been in the community center? </p> 
<p>I know that we see some of you almost every day - and believe me, we love 
seeing you and saying &quot;hi.&quot; </p> 
<p>But now I'm talking to the rest of you. If you haven't visited lately, 
please stop by. And if we haven't met you before, please come to the reception 
area and introduce yourself; chances are very good that there are activities 
which will pique your interest. Come in and pick up a copy of our latest 
newsletter; it details many of the community center-sponsored programs which 
are regularly presented here. We look forward to seeing you and to having you 
as a regular visitor to the center.</p> 
<p>Last Sunday's concert in celebration of Cinco de Mayo was fabulous. The 
group, Mariachi Rio Grande, received a standing ovation from the crowd of about 
80 people who enjoyed two hours of music. At the end, they stepped down from 
the stage and serenaded the crowd with special participation of a man from the 
audience named Ricardo . He has a great voice! Thank you Ricardo for being a 
sport, and thank you Mariachi Rio Grande.</p> 
<p><b>May dance</b></p> 
<p>Dance lovers ... if you haven't been to one of our monthly dance program 
you're missing a great, fun evening.</p> 
<p>Words is out about this fantastic program and it's time to throw away the 
alibis - c'mon down and shake those bodies.</p> 
<p>On Friday, May 19, the community center will come alive with music from DJ 
Michael Murphy from Durango. Michael promises to play a wide variety of music 
so we can dance the night away.</p> 
<p>The dance will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will end at 10:30. Tickets are $5 and 
are available at the center and at WolfTracks. Tickets purchased at the door 
will be $8. There will be a cash bar with assorted beers, wines and soft drinks 
for a nominal charge. Snacks are provided and included in the price of 
admission.</p> 
<p>The dance is an over-21 event and ID may be checked at the door. Table 
reservations may be made at the community center for parties of 8-10. There 
will be one or more tables reserved for singles as the need arises.</p> 
<p>The community center dances are a wonderful way to have an affordable 
evening out on the town. They are almost always the third Friday of the month. 
Setup and decorating begin at 9 a.m. the day of the dances, and we would love 
to have anyone interested come down and help.</p> 
<p>For additional information on the dances, contact Siri at 731-9670, Mercy

quality of items which will be offered for sale at the annual Arts and Crafts 
Show at the community center 3-6 p.m. Friday, May 26, and 9 a.m.-4 p.m. 
Saturday, May 27. Local artists and artisans will display and sell turned

more. Assignments for vendors' booths are being made on a first-come, 
first-served basis. The cost is $40 for an 8x8 space and $50 for a 10x10 space,

<p><b>Evening with the foodies</b></p> 
<p>Are you one of those people who likes talking about food, trying new 
recipes - making them or just tasting?</p> 
<p>Do you search out the best cheeses and just the right wines? Do you get 
excited about fig balsamic vinegar?</p> 
<p>If so, maybe you qualify as a foodie. </p> 
<p>Here at the center we've been thinking that it might be fun to get some of 
Pagosa Springs' foodies together. Michelle and I are planning an evening of 
good food and good conversation and if this idea appeals to you, you're invited 
to join us 6 p.m. May 31.</p> 
<p>Each time we get together we will showcase a different food or course or 
ethnic cuisine. The first meeting, we'll explore the world of appetizers. We 
would like you to bring a favorite appetizer, something you'd make for a really 
special occasion. Or perhaps you'd prefer to bring some wine to share - that's 
OK too. We'll taste and talk. Dessert and coffee will be provided. And, by the 
way, bring your recipe; we'll be sharing those too.</p> 
<p>Be sure to let us know if you plan to come. We need to plan ahead in order 
to have enough dessert for everyone. Call to let us know what you plan to bring 
so we don't all come with pickled shrimp. It will be a fun evening.</p> 
<p><b>Games for fun</b></p> 
<p>We invite all those who love to be indoors and/or play games. This program 
is for anyone who enjoys playing games like Scrabble, Monopoly, poker, card 
games, dominoes, mahjong, bunko, Mercy's popular Filipino domino - whatever 
suits your fancy, but just games for fun. No gambling.</p> 
<p>Volunteers needed for each game. Job responsibility is simple: just come 
forward and be the leader of the game you're interested most. The group will 
meet noon until 4 p.m. Mondays and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursdays. Be sure to 
bring games with you and, if you come on Thursday, you might consider bringing 
lunch.</p> 
<p>The first meeting of the gaming group will be Monday, May 15. If you have 
questions about this program, call Mercy at 264-4152, Ext. 22.</p> 
<p><b>Scrapbooking club</b> </p>

work on their projects. The group also celebrated Cinco de Mayo with lots of 
food.</p>

Room. We will keep you posted with what special activity Melissa Bailey is 
planning for next month. </p>

<p><b>Line dancing</b></p> 
<p>Gerry Potticary and her line dancing friends meet at 10:30 Monday mornings. 
This comment comes from her: &quot;We are currently featuring the electric 
slide, tush push, black velvet, New York New York, a waltz and a cha cha. No 
one remembers it all, but we have a lot of laughs. Come join us. If you need a 
little preliminary coaching, come early at ten.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Hip hop crash course</b> </p> 
<p>Rhonda La Quey, our new Teen Center coordinator, tells us she recently saw 
Jenny Osmialowski, an exchange student from Germany, at the Key Club Talent 
Show. Rhonda was blown away by Jenny's dancing and asked her to teach a 
three-day hip hop dance. As a result, the Teen Center is presenting a Crash 
Course in Hip Hop on May 20, 21 and 22.. Cost is $10 for all three days. The 
time varies each day: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. on May 20; 2-4 p.m. May 21; and 4-8 p.m. 
May 22. After the Monday session there will be a potluck for all who 
participate in the class. Call Rhonda at 264-4152, Ext. 31, for information.</p>
<p><b>Upcoming events</b></p> 
<p>The community center needs volunteers for all three of the following 
events. Please let us know if you can contribute costumes, your time, or your 
expertise in other areas, such as decorating or distributing tickets or flyers. 
The center needs your participation to make these efforts successful. Please 
consider helping.</p> 
<p>- Aug. 11 - Around the World in Pagosa. This event will feature a parade of 
traditional costumes and tastes of food from different countries. We need men, 
women, and children to participate. Volunteers will each represent a country 
and display the traditional costume of that country. Others will prepare and 
sell foods that represent the different countries. More details to follow; 
volunteers may call Mercy now at 264-4152, Ext. 22.</p> 
<p>- Oct. 21 - Hunters' Ball. This will be a dinner and dance fund-raiser for 
all, but especially for hunters. All kinds of volunteers are needed, such as 
women dressed in early 1800s costumes; groups to perform short, funny 
melodramas; or businesses to sell souvenirs and gifts.</p> 
<p>December - Festival of Trees. We are looking for individuals, families or 
groups to sponsor trees which will be decorated and displayed for a week at the 
center; the trees will be displayed for the public. There will be a nominal 
entry fee for each tree. At the end of the week, all trees will be auctioned 
off and the money will go to a non-profit organization, chosen by the tree's 
sponsor.</p> 
<p><b>Computer lab news</b> </p> 
<p>The cavalry is coming.</p> 
<p>A new 24-port switch has been ordered and is on the way. Another good 
thing, as Martha would say, is that a powered vent is being installed in our 
network closet. This should prevent the overheating problems we've been having 
in there. Computer networks are finicky things - they frequently require TLC. 
Ours is on the mend; we'll keep you posted.</p> 
<p>Just a little news about the status of our free computer classes. The next 
beginning classes will start the first week of June and last through July. The 
Tuesday class, by the way, is open to anyone; the Wednesday one is for seniors. 
Currently, the waiting list has enough people on it to fill both the Tuesday 
and the Wednesday classes. However, it sometimes happens that those who 
requested space in one of the classes are unable to come. So, my suggestion 
would be to call and leave your name and phone number in case we have an 
opening. I'll be calling everyone in about a week.</p> 
<p>An intermediate class is now in the works; right now we are finalizing the 
schedule and what will be covered. I anticipate we will cover some of the same 
topics as in the beginning series, however we will go into more detail. For 
example, the beginning class covers only the basics of e-mail. In the 
intermediate group we will focus on e-mail attachments, your provider's 
options/settings, and e-mail problems such as privacy, spam and phishing. Call 
for details.</p> 
<p>A reminder: classes May 23-24 are cancelled.</p>

<p></p> <b>Senior News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Get to know your senior center and programs </b></p> 
<p><b>By Jim Pearson</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Who oversees the senior center in Pagosa Springs and what is its purpose in 
serving our community?</p> 
<p>The Senior Center is known as The Silver Foxes Den, or The Den. Senior 
Services Director Musetta Wollenweber maintains an office at The Den, located 
in the Pagosa Springs Community Center. She supervises a staff of two, nearly 
50 volunteers, senior center operations and activities.</p> 
<p>Musetta is responsible for assessing the needs and strengths of senior 
citizens within our county and develops programs and service delivery plans to 
meet those needs within her program budget. Supervised by County Administrator 
Bob Campbell, Musetta manages various programs and services provided for by 
local, state and federal agencies. Examples are home-delivered and congregate 
meal programs, senior transportation and the Home Chore Program. She serves on 
various committees as a resource and technical advisor. She also promotes 
senior programs and events through marketing, promotional, and public relations 
efforts, which includes developing brochures and publishing event calendars and 
newsletters. Musetta also submits news articles of senior interest, and 
conducts public presentations on such topics as the Medicare Prescription Drug 
program. Most of these programs are closely tied to publicly funded programs 
which require stringent accounting. You can check out what is going on at The 
Den by going to http://archuletacounty.org/Seniors/senior_center.htm.</p> 
<p><b>Archuleta Seniors. Inc.</b></p> 
<p>Is Archuleta Seniors, Inc. part of the senior center, supervised by the 
senior services director?</p> 
<p>The short answer is that Archuleta Seniors, Inc. plays an important role at 
the senior center, but is not supervised by the director. Archuleta Seniors, 
Inc., also known as ASI, is a non-profit corporation, organized exclusively for 
charitable purposes under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 
corporation is served by a board consisting of four officers and eight 
directors, two of whom must reside in the Arboles area. Musetta Wollenweber and 
designated representatives to San Juan Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and Regional 
Advisory Council on Aging (RACOA), serve as ex officio members of the board. 
Commissioner Ronnie Zaday is assigned to represent the county at board meetings.
</p> 
<p>Archuleta Seniors, Inc. works to promote and enhance the health, well 
being, social, cultural and intellectual activities of its members. Through 
fund-raisers and donations, money is raised to provide medical assistance to 
seniors in need, and to provide transportation, equipment and activities. 
Archuleta Seniors, Inc. works closely with Musetta to achieve the goals and 
objectives of both entities.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in helping support senior services in our community, 
tax deductible donations will be accepted by either county senior services or 
Archuleta Seniors, Inc. If you are interested in joining Archuleta Seniors, 
Inc., memberships are available for folks age 55 and over and can be purchased 
at The Den for $5 Mondays and Fridays from 9 a.m.-1:30 p.m. and 9-11 Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays. No memberships are sold Thursdays. Your Seniors Inc. membership 
entitles you to a variety of great discounts from participating merchants in 
our area, plus you'll get senior activity discounts. Membership also entitles 
those who meet annual income guidelines to scholarships for eye glasses, 
hearing aids, dental, prescription drugs and medical equipment. Your membership 
can provide a great discount on the purchase of a dental water jet and electric 
toothbrush. Archuleta Seniors, Inc. even offers financial assistance for 
medical shuttles to Durango handled by The Den. Join now and acquire the 
benefits for 2006.</p> 
<p><b>Arthritis self-help class</b></p> 
<p>For people with arthritis, living the most active life with the least 
amount of pain and disability involves building skills, gaining knowledge and 
developing relationships. The Den, through the instruction of Linda Mozer, is 
offering a six week Arthritis Foundation Self-Help Program course beginning 6-8 
p.m. Thursday, May 18, to encourage people affected by arthritis to be 
proactive in their health and well-being.</p> 
<p>The Arthritis Self-Help Course is a group education program, led by a 
trained instructor and designed to help you learn and practice the different 
skills needed to build your own individualized self-management program and gain 
confidence to carry it out. You will share experiences with others, providing 
you the opportunity to help and learn from people like yourself. This program 
is designed to complement health care provider services.</p> 
<p>Anyone with any type of arthritis, or any persons in a support role, is 
encouraged to attend. Class size is limited to 20 participants, so call The Den 
for registration and further information at 264-2167. We hope you take 
advantage of this educational and supportive opportunity to help you overcome 
some of the challenges of arthritis.</p> 
<p><b>Learn to play bridge</b></p> 
<p>The Den has a very active bridge group, and this popular card game is our 
top Den activity. If this is an activity you think might interest you, but you 
don't know how to play, sign up by calling The Den. Bridge lessons will be 
scheduled Fridays as long as people are interested. The next bridge lesson is 
scheduled for 11 a.m. May 12.</p> 
<p><b>Mother's Day</b></p> 
<p>Mother's Day was first suggested in the United States in 1872 by Julia Ward 
Howe, who wrote the words to the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic,&quot; as a 
day dedicated to peace.</p> 
<p>In 1907, Ana Jarvis began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day. 
Jarvis persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, W.Va., to celebrate Mother's 
Day on the second anniversary of her mother's death, the second Sunday of May. 
Jarvis and her supporters began to write to ministers, businessmen, and 
politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day.</p> 
<p>By 1911, Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. In 1914, 
President Woodrow Wilson made the official announcement proclaiming Mother's 
Day as a national holiday that was to be held each year on the second Sunday in 
May. We will celebrate Mother's Day at the Senior Center Friday, May 12. The 
Den will have a special gift for all women who attend lunch on this special day 
in honor of all the love, support, strength and warmth they add to the world. 
Please come to The Den for lunch and help us say &quot;thank you&quot; for all 
they do.</p> 
<p><b>White Cane Society </b></p>

<p><b>Oktoberfest volunteers</b></p> 
<p>October is fast approaching, and Archuleta Seniors, Inc. is looking for 
volunteers to serve on committees charged with making this the best Oktoberfest 
ever in Pagosa Springs. We need a person interested in teaching the polka to 
adults, and the chicken dance to elementary-age children. We are also looking 
for committee help with the program, food preparation, food serving, etc. This 
is the largest fund-raiser for Archuleta Seniors, Inc. For more information, 
contact me at The Den, 264-2167.</p> 
<p><b>Medicare prescription drugs</b></p> 
<p>We would like to thank all Medicare and Medicaid recipients who used our 
Medicare Prescription Drug Program services at The Den to get enrolled with the 
insurance company that best fit their needs.</p> 
<p>We realize that many recipients encountered problems in purchasing 
prescription drugs under the new program after they were enrolled and we 
applaud their perseverance as we at The Den worked with the pharmacies, 
insurance companies and Medicare to resolve problems.</p> 
<p>Medicare recipients can still enroll in the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Program after May 15, but will incur a 1-percent lifetime penalty for each 
month they wait. This 1-percent penalty does not affect those who turn 65 after 
May 15 and enroll in the Medicare Prescription Drug Program at the same time 
they enroll in Medicare. If you are eligible for the program, but have not 
enrolled yet or need additional information, contact Musetta at The Den, 
264-2167.</p> 
<p><b>Medical shuttles</b></p> 
<p>A shuttle service to Durango for medical appointments is available through 
Archuleta County Senior Services. This service is available to adults of all 
ages and will get you to and from your non-emergency medical appointments.</p> 
<p>In most cases, service can be provided with 48 hours advance notice. The 
roundtrip fare is $30 or less, with rates varying depending on the number of 
passengers. If you are a 2006 member of Archuleta Seniors Inc., your fare is 
$10. Our mini-van is unable to accommodate wheelchairs. Call Musetta at 
264-2167 for further information.</p> 
<p>For cancer patients needing transportation for cancer treatment, the 
American Cancer Society provides free roundtrip transportation to Durango. For 
further information contact the Durango office at 247-0278.</p> 
<p><b>Home-delivered meals</b></p> 
<p>Many people don't realize that Meals on Wheels was the result of the Blitz, 
a period of intense bombing of London during World War II. Many residents of 
Britain lost their homes and their ability to cook meals for themselves and 
their families. The Civil Defense, Women's Volunteer Service, prepared and 
delivered meals to these people. They also brought refreshments in canteens to 
service personnel. This canteen refreshment program became known as Meals on 
Wheels, and was the first organized nutrition program.</p> 
<p>Following the war, our country began experimenting with its own 
home-delivered nutritional meal program. The program in the United States began 
by feeding seven seniors, and has since grown to serve millions of elderly, 
disabled or at-risk persons across the country.</p> 
<p>The Den provides home-delivered meals to qualifying homebound individuals 
who want the benefits of a nutritional lunch. The Den's caring volunteers 
deliver the meals to homes Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays while 
taking the time to check in with the individuals. The appetizing lunches are 
served hot and ready to eat. Whether you want a meal delivered one or four 
times a week, we can accommodate your needs.</p> 
<p>Are you looking for a way to volunteer some time to your community and make 
an immediate impact on someone's life? The Den has an opportunity for you to 
make new friends while you donate one lunch hour per week to the home-delivered 
meal program.</p> 
<p>Applications are currently being accepted from individuals as well as 
businesses, churches and other organizations that would like to make a 
difference. All applicants must provide their own vehicle and be available in 
one-hour increments once a week. We are also accepting applications for 
substitute drivers. A background check will be completed on all applicants. 
Adopt a home-delivery route today and brighten the lives of a few senior 
citizens. For more information, contact Musetta at 264-2167.</p> 
<p><b>Senior of the Week</b></p> 
<p>We congratulate Jerry La Quey as our Senior of the Week. Jerry will enjoy 
free lunches all week. We also congratulate Marion Goodnight, in Arboles. She 
will enjoy free lunches at Arboles Meal Day for the month of May.</p> 
<p><b>Mystery trips</b></p> 
<p>Up, up and away you go, but come rain or shine, a jacket will protect you, 
if you're not afraid of the dark that is.</p> 
<p>But where we are going, we cannot tell you.</p> 
<p>A mystery trip is a secret, but we can give you a clue: this will be a ride 
you will not soon forget.</p> 
<p>Mystery trips at The Den are very popular and are scheduled on a 
reservation basis. Most of these trips are limited to 18 people. You must be a 
member of Archuleta Seniors, Inc. to be eligible, as most of the cost is paid 
for by the organization. Mystery trips are advertised in the Silver Foxes Den 
Senior Center newsletter, which is published monthly. Reservations are not 
taken until the first day of the month and are only for the mystery trip for 
that month. Physical requirements for each trip differ, but limitations are 
always provided. Participants will also be given instructions on how to dress 
and what to bring. All trips to date have been one-day trips and departure and 
return times are posted.</p> 
<p>Trip costs are kept at a minimum to allow everybody a chance to 
participate. If you are a member of Archuleta Seniors, Inc. and would like to 
spice up your life with a mystery trip, come to The Den to find out more about 
it. The next trip, May 25, is already full, but we are putting names on a 
waiting list. Cost of a trip is $5, plus money for lunch at a restaurant.</p> 
<p><b>USPS presents</b></p> 
<p>The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, as part of the crime victims' rights 
and consumer protection initiatives, has provided The Den with an informative 
DVD film. The film, titled &quot;Delivering Justice - All The King's Men,&quot; 
is a story of financial crime victims and their efforts to recover.</p> 
<p>If you are a victim of a financial crime, want tips that may help you avoid 
becoming a victim or want to become aware of what recourse you would have 
should you become a victim, you can check out this 15-minute DVD from The Den's 
library to view at home, or watch in our lounge.</p> 
<p><b>Yoga in Motion</b></p> 
<p>Most of the exercises today mainly focus on the muscles, usually executed 
in jarring and abrupt motions that in the long run could cause injuries.</p> 
<p>When your body moves, your bones and muscles move too. When your joints are 
too tight, you can't move freely.</p> 
<p>Yoga in Motion works to free up your joints. With graceful dancelike 
movements, Yoga in Motion consists of fluid, nonstop circular movements with 
breathing patterns that stimulate better circulation. It loosens the arms, 
shoulders and chest, working gently on the joints and muscles. You can extend 
your limitations the more you stretch and rotate your joints, which promotes 
flexibility. Benefits include improved posture, increased strength and energy 
and less chronic stiffness. Anyone can perform the workout regardless of body 
type, age and fitness level. Yoga in Motion relaxes the mind and revitalizes 
the body's natural energy, while promoting an overall sense of well-being. Come 
experience this type of yoga through our instructor Suki at The Den 10 a.m. 
every Tuesday.</p>

<p></p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Are you a veteran, and what are your benefits? </b></p> 
<p>I often encounter veterans who do not know anything about the VA benefits 
for which they might be eligible.</p> 
<p>They tell me they have never looked into VA benefits or in some cases may 
have not had a good experience with a VA representative or VSO in the past and 
did not pursue matters any further. Many do not even think they are veterans 
because they did not go overseas to fight in a war or conflict.</p> 
<p>I hope I can set the record straight on who is a veteran and the 
eligibility requirement for most basic VA benefits and claims. Much of the 
information here comes from official VA information sources.</p> 
<p><b>General eligibility</b> </p> 
<p>First of all, eligibility for most VA benefits is based upon discharge from 
active military service under other than dishonorable conditions.</p> 
<p>Active service means full-time service, other than active duty for 
training, as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, 
or as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service, Environmental 
Science Services Administration or National oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, or its predecessor, the Coast and Geodetic Survey.</p> 
<p>Generally, men and women veterans with similar service may be entitled to 
the same VA benefits.</p> 
<p><b>BCD or dishonorable</b> </p> 
<p>Dishonorable or bad conduct discharges issued by general courts-martial may 
bar VA benefits.</p> 
<p>Veterans in prison and parolees must contact a VA regional office to 
determine eligibility. VA benefits will not be provided to any veteran or 
dependent wanted for an outstanding felony warrant.</p> 
<p><b>Wartime service</b></p> 
<p>Certain VA benefits require do require wartime service. Under the law, VA 
recognizes these war periods:</p> 
<p>- Mexican Border Period and World War I are recognized as official war 
periods, but I do not believe there are any veterans of these conflicts now 
alive or residing in this area.</p> 
<p>- World War II: Dec. 7, 1941, through Dec. 31, 1946.</p> 
<p>- Korean War: June 27, 1950, through Jan. 31, 1955.</p> 
<p>- Vietnam War: Aug. 5, 1964 (Feb. 28, 1961, for veterans who served 
&quot;in country&quot; before Aug. 5, 1964), through May 7, 1975.</p> 
<p>- Gulf War: Aug. 2, 1990, through a date to be set by law or presidential 
proclamation.</p> 
<p><b>Important documents</b> </p> 
<p>Those seeking a VA benefit for the first time must submit a copy of their 
service discharge form (DD-214, DD-215, or for WW II veterans, a WD form), 
which documents service dates and type of discharge, or give their full name, 
military service number, and branch and dates of service. The veteran's service 
discharge form should be kept in a safe location accessible to the veteran and 
next of kin or designated representative. </p> 
<p>Many of our local veterans bring a copy of their discharge form to be kept 
on file in the Veterans Service Office for future needs. Also, county clerks' 
offices nationwide will record the document free of charge. If the clerk's 
office records from the original document they will certify any copies. If they 
are recording from a copy of the document, they cannot certify its originality. 
This could be important for future benefit or claims purposes (SSA applications 
require an original or certified copy of this document).</p> 
<p><b>Death benefits</b></p> 
<p>The following documents will be needed for claims processing related to a 
veteran's death:</p> 
<p>1. Veteran's marriage certificate for claims of a surviving spouse or 
children.</p> 
<p>2. Veteran's death certificate if the veteran did not die in a VA health 
care facility.</p> 
<p>3. Children's birth certificates or adoption papers to determine children's 
benefits.</p> 
<p>4. Veteran's birth certificate to determine parents' benefits.</p> 
<p>Common Law marriages are recognized by the VA with certain documentation 
and statements.</p> 
<p><b>24.3 million vets</b> </p> 
<p>Of the 24.3 million veterans currently alive, nearly three-quarters served 
during a war or an official period of conflict. About a quarter of the nation's 
population, approximately 63 million people, are potentially eligible for VA 
benefits and services because they are veterans, family members or survivors of 
veterans.</p> 
<p><b>Long-term responsibility</b></p> 
<p>The responsibility to care for veterans, spouses , survivors and dependents 
can last a long time. Five children of Civil War veterans still draw VA 
benefits. About 440 children and widows of Spanish-American War veterans still 
receive VA compensation or pensions.</p> 
<p>Next week: Specific eligibility requirements for certain VA benefits.</p> 
<p><b>Share-A-Ride</b></p> 
<p>Don't forget to call or stop by my office with your VA health care 
appointments for the Share-A-Ride (program. Help a fellow veteran who may be 
going in the same direction to the same VA facility. Give me a call if you can 
provide transportation or need transportation. I will keep a calendar of who is 
going where to coordinate this important program.</p>

Suite G, (next to Big 5 Sports). Phone number is 247-2214. Albuquerque VAMC

<p><b>'Where the Wild Things Are'- at the auction </b></p> 
<p><b>By Christine Eleanor Anderson</b> </p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The Seeds of Learning benefit suction is 6 p.m. Friday, May 12, at the 
community center.</p> 
<p>Carol and David Brown generously sponsored the library table. One of our 
great volunteers, interior designer Anita Sherman-Hughes, took the decoration 
of the table on as her library project (some volunteers ask for one-time 
projects rather than regular weekly library work) for the year.</p> 
<p>Each table setting, fabulously decorated on the theme of a children's book, 
will be auctioned off in its entirety at the end of the evening. Lucky people 
will go home with new dinner settings and table decorations. Seeds of Learning 
will get the proceeds for their new building.</p> 
<p>For the library table theme, Anita chose &quot;Where The Wild Things 
Are,&quot; by Maurice Sendak - her daughter's favorite book. She scoured and 
begged and bargained and bought an amazing bunch of dishes, goblets, napkin 
rings and table decorations (from eBay yet). The Unitarians chipped in when our 
volunteer designer went a wee bit past the modest library budget allocation. 
Then too, Anita garnered lovely donations from Lee Riley, Mike Coffee and 
Jackie and Peter Welch.</p> 
<p>The storyboard and some of the dishes and decorations are on display in the 
exhibit case at the front of the library. Tomorrow they will come out to go to 
the auction table. Go &quot;Wild&quot; for the Seeds of Learning. And, thank 
you so much, Anita.</p> 
<p><b>Volunteer orientation</b></p> 
<p>And speaking of volunteers: the summer volunteer orientation will be held 
at the library at 10 a.m. Tuesday, June 6. Come and volunteer for all kinds of 
summer projects at the library. We rely on all of our volunteers to keep 
wonderful things happening here. Hope you'll put this date on your calendar and 
join us.</p> 
<p><b>Pagosa Reads! </b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Reads! continues this week with the &quot;People of the Moon&quot; 
book discussion group at the library at 3 p.m. Saturday, May 13. This 
eye-opening piece of fiction by the Gears gives us plenty to contemplate 
besides water in a time of drought.</p> 
<p>Human behavior in a time of stress will be one of the topics of the 
discussion. We hope to see you and hear your views on this subject and its 
treatment in the book.</p> 
<p>Remember, the People of the Moon Art Contest deadline is May 22. And, see 
Barb Draper's column in this issue of The PREVIEW about the children's programs 
for Pagosa Reads! and the popular summer reading program.</p> 
<p>The regular second Saturday of the month Pagosa Pretenders Family Theatre 
activity will be at Town Park at 11 a.m. this week, not in the library. It will 
be an interactive drama based on the book &quot;Common Ground,&quot; by Molly 
Bang.</p> 
<p>Chimney Rock tour </p> 
<p>Our final event for Pagosa Reads! is a special tour of Chimney Rock led by 
Glenn Raby, 10 a.m. Saturday, June 3. He will focus on water-related ruins and 
other matters brought up by &quot;People of the Moon.&quot;</p> 
<p>If you wish to join us for this tour, please sign up at the library desk. 
We are limited to 80 participants and the slots are going fast. Call 264-2208 
for more information. </p> 
<p><b>Summer plans </b></p> 
<p>The trustees and staff and I have decided on some summer landscaping and 
decor to make the entrance of the library welcoming while we are still thinking 
about final plans for the entire library grounds.</p> 
<p>By early June, we should have picnic tables, benches, a coffee/refreshment 
cart, outside book sale carts and some colorful plants at the entrance of the 
library for your enjoyment. Our lovely blue Pagosa Reads! banner will be flying 
in front too.</p> 
<p>The Mountain High Gardeners will help us spruce up some of the planting 
beds. Bill Nobles has recommended red and white clover on the rest of the 
grounds as an interim yard cover while we are deciding on permanent 
arrangements.</p> 
<p>Harold Morrison, a very loyal and wonderfully productive volunteer, is 
taking care of the mulching of the picnic table area. We are so grateful for 
all of the help you give us, Harold. Thank You.</p> 
<p>Book sale change</p> 
<p>The date for the library book sale and annual Friends meeting this year has 
been changed to Sept. 8 and 9. We did not realize there was a conflict with the 
Humane Society auction when we previously settled on the August dates.</p> 
<p><b>Stolen children and collapsing societies</b> </p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Collapse,&quot; by Jared Diamond, Penguin Group, New York, 2005.</p> 
<p>In his Pulitzer Prize winning bestseller &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; 
(1997), Jared Diamond examined how western civilization developed the 
techniques to dominate much of the world.</p> 
<p>Now, Diamond has written, &quot;Collapse,&quot; an account of the great 
civilizations that collapsed and why those that survived did so.</p> 
<p>He gives the reader a five-point framework of possible contributing factors 
he considers intriguing to understand when considering why changes occurred or 
not.</p> 
<p>1. Environmental damage.</p> 
<p>2. Climate change.</p> 
<p>3. Hostile neighbors.</p> 
<p>4. Friendly trade partners.</p> 
<p>5. Society's response to it's environmental problems.</p> 
<p>He uses this framework to trace the Polynesian civilization on Easter 
Island, the doomed medieval Viking colony on Greenland, and the formerly 
flourishing Native American civilization of the Anasazi and the Maya. Why did 
they fail and other cultures find solutions to their problems and survive?</p> 
<p>Diamond points out that, despite our own society's apparent inexhaustible 
wealth, ominous warnings have begun to emerge even in robust areas like 
Montana. In his very readable style, Diamond spells out what happens when we 
squander our resources and he tells us what other cultures are doing to prevent 
failure.</p> 
<p>This is an important book, highly recommended by Dr. Andrew Gulliford, 
professor of Southwest studies at Fort Lewis College. The book is at the Sisson 
Library.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Captured : A True Story of Abduction by Indians on the Texas 
Frontier,&quot; by Scott Zesch, St. Martins Press, New York, 2004.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Captured&quot; is the account of 10-year-old Adolph Korn who was 
abducted by an Indian raiding party while tending sheep in the Texas Hill 
Country. The year was 1880.</p> 
<p>Korn was the ancestral uncle of Scott Zesch, a sixth-generation Texan who 
grew up in Mason, Texas. When he stumbled on to Korn's tombstone in a remote 
corner of an old cemetery in Mason County, he knew who Korn was, for he had 
heard the legend of how Korn had been captured and forcibly returned nearly 
three years later, never to fit into society.</p> 
<p>Zesch was determined to know more about his ancestor and understand how a 
timid German boy such as Adolph became so thoroughly Indianized in such a short 
time. He interviewed family members, dug into archives and talked with Comanche 
elders. He expanded his research to seven other children in the region who were 
captured by the Comanche and Apache. All were returned to civilization after 
much wrangling between the U.S. Government but none of the 
&quot;recaptured&quot; ever readjusted to established society.</p> 
<p>The story is important history, well researched and easy to read.</p> 
<p>Scott Zesch graduated from Texas A&amp;M, and Harvard Law School. He is the 
author of one other book, &quot;Alamo Heights&quot; and is a songwriter and a 
dramatist. He divides his time between New York City and a ranch in Art, Texas. 
He is the nephew of Peggy Laverty. This book was the winner of the TCU-Texas 
Book Award for the Best Book on Texas. Ruby Sisson Library has this book. </p>

<p><b>Marketing technology</b></p> 
<p>The deadline for savings with early registration in Pagosa Springs Arts 
Council Web and marketing classes is fast approaching - May 14.</p> 
<p>Because of requests from throughout the community, PSAC has added more 
dates for Web and marketing classes.</p> 
<p>Local businesses and artists have a unique opportunity to increase their 
Web site and marketing awareness through a series of seminars, sponsored by 
PSAC. It's time to wake up and market your business.</p> 
<p>What business hasn't experienced a marketing slump? Perhaps it could be 
because of personal challenges, lack of motivation, the competition has a new 
service, technique, product, or maybe there's just more competition in Pagosa 
(and surrounding area) these days.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs Arts Council presents a series of four marketing workshops, 
&quot;Falling Forward: Web Site Marketing &amp; Logistics&quot; (June 7) and 
The Secret of Your Success: Marketing Your Biz&quot; (June 16). The series is 
specifically directed toward artists, but would also benefit any business. Each 
session's information stands alone and sessions may be attended individually or 
as an entire series. All sessions will be held at the Arts Room in the Pagosa 
Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>This exciting marketing series is available to PSAC members and general 
public. Advance registration is required to assure seating. Individual sessions

<p><b>Kids' photo camp</b></p> 
<p>Parents are always searching for creative summer camp options for their 
children.</p> 
<p>PSAC is excited to announce a special art camp, PHOTOlearn&reg;, July 17-20 
for youngsters ages 5-10.</p> 
<p>I will be the presenter in this, a series of children's PHOTOlearn&reg;' 
classes, held at the Pagosa Springs Community Center. I've covered life's 
events as a photojournalist for more than 25 years, and I'll share my knowledge 
with aspiring child photographers. I hold a B.F.A. from Virginia Commonwealth 
University in communications arts and design and I have spoken numerous times 
at professional photography conventions and was featured as the one of 12 
wedding photographers in Wedding 2000, a live video cast program in 1998. My 
cowboy and rodeo images have appeared in American Cowboy Magazine and western 
images will be featured in the Greeley Independence Stampede Art Show in 2006.
</p> 
<p>The series of photography PHOTOlearn&reg; class sessions is a special 
opportunity for children to learn with a real working professional. Space is 
limited to 15 students. There are two sessions (total of four days) offered. 
Students may attend two or four days, with budget pricing for those attending 
all four days.</p> 
<p>The two-day session fee is $145 (PSAC members $125). The four-day session 
fee is $195 (PSAC members $155). A second child is $95 /$125. The fee includes 
all materials, disposable cameras or film, and image processing. Participants 
should wear sunscreen and hats, as we'll be photographing outside (water 
bottles provided). Preregister for the summer camp by April 17 and save $10 per 
session.</p>

<p><b>Shutterbug Series</b></p> 
<p>The unfortunate truth about photographs is that the picture we often see is 
not the picture we get!</p> 
<p>The human eye sees differently than a camera, and it's our job to 
compensate to get the picture we see.</p> 
<p>PSAC announces a series of PHOTOlearn&reg; photography sessions designed 
for practical shutterbugs. I will conduct these workshops.</p> 
<p>The solution to better images is a simple understanding of photography and 
it normally takes no more effort than making endless mistakes. PHOTOlearn&reg; 
is a quick option to educate the average shutterbug and avoid wasted time and 
errors.</p> 
<p>Sessions are open to all levels of shutterbugs (film or digital), including 
high school and college students (who attend for about half price). Five series 
topics are dedicated to individual two-hour sessions and will be held at the 
Pagosa Springs Community Center, Art and Crafts Room. Register by April 17 and 
receive $10 discounts on each session!</p> 
<p>The sessions are:</p> 
<p>- 35mm camera operation - July 10, 6-8 p.m.</p> 
<p>- Available Light (F-stops/shutter speeds) - July 11, 6-8 p.m. </p> 
<p>- Electronic flash systems - July 12, 6-8 p.m.</p> 
<p>- 35mm B&amp;W infrared film - July 22, 10 a.m.-noon.</p> 
<p>- Processing B&amp;W film - July 22, 1:30-3:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>For more information and registration, call me at 264-4486 (or visit 
www.wendysaunders.com and pagosa-arts.com).</p> 
<p>Home and garden tour</p> 
<p>Mark your calendars for Sunday, July 9, and plan to attend the PSAC Home 
and Garden Tour.</p> 
<p>This year our tour will concentrate on the U.S. 84 area, featuring homes 
and ranches between the intersection of U.S. 160 and U.S. 84 and Alpine Lakes. 
Ticket prices are $10 to PSAC members and $12 to non-members. More details will 
be announced, so stay tuned.</p>

<p><b>Food for Thought</b> </p> 
<p><b>I scan, can you scan? </b></p> 
<p><b>Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p>Broccoli?</p> 
<p>No problemo: 3082.</p> 
<p>Garlic?</p> 
<p>A snap: 4068.</p> 
<p>Spring mix?</p> 
<p>Hah, easy, Child's play, in fact: 4825.</p> 
<p>Ever used the U-Scan line at the local grocery store?</p> 
<p>You know, the checkout line where the customer does all the work in order 
to allow the store to save on wages, and thus pass those savings on to 
customers? Remember all those savings you've realized lately?</p> 
<p>You bring your goods to the stand, titillate the machine, choose to hear a 
digitized voice deliver instructions in either English or Espanol ( the Spanish 
speaker is extremely friendly), scan in your items using, if you must, handy 
and vivid graphic displays of various fruits and vegetables to find codes for 
items without a bar code on them.</p> 
<p>I use the U-Scan every time I go to the store.</p> 
<p>Not only do I use the service, but I am, with all due modesty, the U-Scan 
King of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Perhaps of southwest Colorado.</p> 
<p>Perhaps, dare I say, of the continental U.S. of A.</p> 
<p>Oh yes &#138; I'm good.</p> 
<p>This is not a talent acquired easily, or with haphazard effort. It is, 
moreover, a skill to which only a few are born and the rest (that's most of 
you, dear readers) must labor long and hard to own.</p> 
<p>Plainly put: There is a small number of us who possess an innate talent, an 
inherent ability to manipulate U-Scan technology and techniques.</p> 
<p>Comes naturally to us.</p> 
<p>Just as some folks are born to play basketball and others to run the 
football or do differential equations, there are those of us who are born to 
pass through U-Scan lines like a hot knife through butter. Who knows why? 
Perhaps our mothers passed too close to a source of radiation or drank some air 
freshener when we were in utero. Perhaps it is an evolutionary adaptation. Why, 
simply doesn't matter.</p> 
<p>What matters is some of us got it, most of us don't.</p> 
<p>I've got it.</p> 
<p>And I'm not afraid to show what I've got at our local supermarket, on a 
daily basis.</p> 
<p>Because of my obvious expertise, I have drawn the attention and admiration 
of the store personnel who man the assistance stand at the U-Scan terminus. I 
have become their friend. Yea, their colleague.</p> 
<p>And, I should note, somewhat of a role model and hero at the store.</p> 
<p>Given my stature, I and those like me (and, believe me, we proud few 
recognize each other) are more than a bit peeved by U-Scan novices and, 
especially, by U-Scan idiots.</p> 
<p>Plenty of them around, mark my word.</p> 
<p>The earmarks of the U-Scan idiot?</p> 
<p>Here are some of the worst.</p> 
<p>First, there's the pinhead who ignores the 15 item or less rule. (He or she 
is kin to that other obnoxious group - the Express Lane violators). There they 
are: Clem and Elly May, slowly scanning the 4,256 items they've crammed in 
three grocery baskets - baskets blocking the path of we U-Scan pros - one 
frozen burrito at a time.</p> 
<p>For crying out loud, people, can't you read the sign? It is brightly 
colored and illuminated for a reason!</p> 
<p>Then, there's the mental midget who can't figure out the machine itself, 
even with perfectly clear instructions delivered in English or Espanol. Once 
the rotary telephone disappeared from the scene, this twit was adrift as far as 
technology goes and observing him at the U-Scan terminal is like watching a 
gibbon try to drive a Ferrari.</p> 
<p>Then there's the simp who can't find the number codes for items. She 
shuffles to the cashier stand with an item clutched in her limp paw, whining 
about the darned code. A moment later, she's back. And on and on and on &#138;
</p> 
<p>And, maybe worst of all, there is the clown who demands the attendant run 
and check an item on the shelf because the U-Scan machine did not credit an 
alleged discount. He keeps those of us who possess superior U-Scan skills from 
promptly paying and receiving our receipt. The fool is delusional and doesn't 
realize a critical truth: U-Scan technology is infallible.</p> 
<p>As are those of us who are recognized U-Scan experts.</p> 
<p>U-Scan idiots are getting in our way, making life difficult.</p> 
<p>Take yesterday. I hustle through the store because I am in a hurry to get 
home and watch House Hunters on the Home and Garden Channel - my new favorite 
show. Deb and Lance are moving from their cramped apartment because Deb is 
expecting twins. (They're optimists and they've named the fetuses Cyrus and 
Mandy). Will they choose the modest bungalow with some fix-up necessary, or 
will they go beyond their comfort zone, break the budget and spend a lot more 
on that loft Lance has always wanted? My bet is the loft, since this is America 
and credit is never a burden or a worry. We're a Chapter 7 kind of culture.</p> 
<p>I have a hankerin' for eggplant Parmesan. I whiz to the produce section and 
look for eggplant. Nada.</p> 
<p>&quot;The guys at the warehouse have been shorting me on eggplant for three 
days,&quot; says the section manager.</p> 
<p>OK, I buy two zucchini (4223), two yellow squash (same code), a red Bell 
pepper (4088), a head of garlic (4608), a white onion (4663), greens (4825) and 
a can of garbanzo beans. I fly over to the flesh section and pick up a pack of 
85/15 ground turkey. I've got the other ingredients I need at home.</p> 
<p>I streak to the U-Scan and every terminal is occupied.</p> 
<p>By idiots.</p> 
<p>One halfwit keeps setting off a U-Scan alarm because he fails to put his 
scanned items in the bag when ordered &#138; in English, at that.</p> 
<p>Another goof is trying to scan a cantaloupe.</p> 
<p>A mooncalf at Terminal 3 is trying to stuff a twenty-dollar bill into the 
credit card slot.</p> 
<p>The lad at Terminal 4 is picking his nose. He looks hungry.</p> 
<p>Arrrrrggghhhhhhh.</p> 
<p>I miss the essential first half of House Hunters, and my day is nearly 
ruined.</p> 
<p>My only solace is the food.</p> 
<p>I dice the onion and pepper. I peel and chunk the squash. I mash five 
cloves of garlic and mince the remains. I finely dice some celery. I saute the 
onion, celery and pepper in extra virgin olive oil, seasoning with salt, 
pepper, oregano and basil and, when all is soft, in goes the garlic.</p> 
<p>I cook for a minute or so and add most of a can of crushed, fire-roasted 
tomatoes and a cup or so of chicken stock. I rinse the garbanzos and toss them 
in and amp up the herbs a bit. In goes a tablespoon of chicken demi-glace and I 
set the mess to simmer.</p> 
<p>I cook it into squashy oblivion, adding stock when necessary.</p> 
<p>With it, some simple turkey burgers (I'm broke; I've been spending our 
savings on wine). I add panko to the ground turkey along with minced onion and 
garlic, salt and pepper, a bit of oregano. I brown the patties with a vengeance 
then pop them into the veggie stew and let them simmer in the goo for 15 or 20 
minutes. I top each with three slices of sharp cheddar and let the cheese melt.
</p> 
<p>A salad with the greens (4825), some sliced tomato and oil cured olives - a 
lemon vinaigrette with crumbled feta - and the deed is done.</p> 
<p>Though I know it is oh-so-wrong, I have a half bottle of a wonderful Cahors 
and I drink the hefty red with the meal. Darned good, simple food and wine.</p> 
<p>But, I am still agitated.</p> 
<p>We need to do something about folks flooding the U-Scan line who have 
absolutely no right to be there.</p> 
<p>I have a plan to rid the U-Scan line of the feebs who clutter the process.
</p> 
<p>The first thing: seal off the U-Scan area with a tall fence. At the gate - 
armed guards. We must protect the border.</p> 
<p>Then, for those who wish to be admitted (and have not proven their 
expertise to the staff's satisfaction), a test.</p> 
<p>Every Tuesday, between noon and 3 p.m. card tables can be set up at the 
store entrance. Several U-Scan training monitors will be placed on the tables 
and attendants will be at the ready, evaluating a mock U-Scan run-through. 
Candidates take the mock test as well as a written exam. A combined score of 
180 is sufficient for the candidate to receive a &quot;green card&quot; - a 
document stating the customer is granted probationary status and can use the 
U-Scan, under supervision. Each time through the U-Scan line, the probationer 
will be videotaped and timed. Three months (or 100 visits, whichever comes 
first) and the customer's record is reviewed by management. If everyone on the 
manager's review committee agrees, a customer is granted permanent U-Scan 
status. Those who fail are sent back to the regular checkout lines.</p> 
<p>I think this will work.</p> 
<p>And, at last, I will be able to whip through the process unhindered by 
amateurs and interlopers.</p> 
<p>And be home in time for House Hunters.</p> 
<p>Stan and Betsy are thinking about selling their condo and finding a place 
with a yard where their Australian shepherd, Boxy, will have a lawn on which to 
do his vile canine business.</p> 
<p>I'll need something to nibble on while I watch the show.</p> 
<p>Perhaps some of that sharp cheddar and a Gala apple (4133).</p>

<p><b>Second Basic GPS class</b> </p> 
<p>Due to a huge response for the first Basic GPS class, the Archuleta County 
Cooperative Extension Office will offer a second class scheduled at 7 p.m. June 
6.</p> 
<p>The GPS model of choice being reviewed will be the Garmin Etrex Legend. If 
you have any type of Etrex, the features are all quite similar. There will be 
units provided to learn on but if you have your own GPS, bring it.</p> 
<p>If you have specific questions about how to do something, write them down 
and bring them with you.</p> 
<p>The class is free and will last approximately two hours. Handouts and 
easy-to-use instructions will be given. This class is open to adults and will 
be limited to the first 16 persons (no exceptions).</p> 
<p>Call Kim today to reserve your spot, 264-5931. </p> 
<p><b>Manage field bindweed</b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Extension Offices will receive at least 100 releases 
of bindweed mite at $20 per release.</p> 
<p>Each release will treat 25 acres, and is 75-percent effective in 
controlling field bindweed after two years. The releases will be delivered at 
the end of May or early in June. Releases will be limited to 10 per person and 
must be prepaid. If you are interested in purchasing the bindweed mites, 
contact the Archuleta County Extension Office at 264-5931 or e-mail 
archuelt@ext.colostate.edu.</p> 
<p>Field bindweed (Convovulus arvensis) is one of the most widespread and 
difficult-to-manage weeds growing throughout the United States.</p> 
<p>The vining plant produces an extensive root system that stores enough 
nutrients to fuel extensive growth. The plant thrives in the arid western 
states and will grow on many sites where other plants cannot exist.</p> 
<p>Control with herbicides is difficult. Bindweed can be successfully managed 
on some sites with fall applications of glyphosate containing herbicides. 
Control in localities with desirable vegetation, inaccessible areas, as well as 
many agricultural systems is nearly impossible with herbicides.</p> 
<p>The bindweed mite, Aceria malherbae, is a microscopic eriophyid mite 
imported from southern Europe as a biological control agent for field bindweed. 
The bindweed mite feeds only on field bindweed and closely-related wild morning 
glories. It does not damage other plant species, and it requires bindweed to 
survive.</p> 
<p>Bindweed mite feeding causes the formation of gall-like growth of plant 
leaves. Leaves of infested plants become thickened, and have a 
&quot;fuzzy&quot; texture. In heavily infested plants, the shoots are misshapen 
and growth is severely stunted. Newly emerged leaves on recently infested 
plants appear folded with thickened midribs. The thickened texture and fuzzy 
appearance are good diagnostic characteristics to identify bindweed mite 
presence.</p> 
<p>Bindweed mites have the potential to aid in suppression or control of field 
bindweed in many arid regions, and under many plant management regimes. They 
can be useful in wild land settings, pastures, roadsides, disturbed areas, 
landscape plantings, and other areas. The best results will be obtained with 
active management by mowing the bindweed, which moves the mites around and 
stimulates new growth for the mites to feed on. Bindweed mites survive better 
in drier settings. Their impact in sprinkler irrigated settings, especially 
lawns, will probably be less than in nonirrigated sites.</p> 
<p>Bindweed mites spend the winter on the underground buds of bindweed 
rhizomes. The protected overwintering site allows them to survive extreme 
winter conditions, and they have successfully overwintered in the harsh 
environments of Canada and Montana.</p> 
<p>Excessive moisture appears to be one of the environmental factors that 
limits their establishment. Attempts at establishing them have not been 
successful in areas with significant rainfall and high humidity. Bindweed mites 
can survive extended drought periods by actively moving to underground buds 
when plant tops die down. Initial establishment of bindweed mites has been most 
successful on the drier sites, as long as the bindweed is actively growing when 
the release is made.</p> 
<p>Bindweed mites are available from collections of infested plant material. 
It is best to release mites in the cooler part of the day to maximize their 
survival. The infested plants should be placed in direct contact with the 
bindweed that is to be infested. They should be either tucked under the plants 
or twisted up with the bindweed vines to keep it in place and from blowing 
away. Newly infested galls (folded leaves) should be apparent within a week or 
so after spring releases.</p> 
<p>In many cases, establishment may take a full growing season. Do not disturb 
the release site for a few weeks, then mow the area (if feasible) to distribute 
the mites and stimulate new bindweed growth. When galls are easily found, they 
can be harvested and spread to new areas.</p> 
<p>Success in managing field bindweed with bindweed mites is highly dependent 
on your expectations and long-term commitment. If you expect the bindweed to 
disappear shortly after releasing the mites, you will be disappointed. The 
initial impact will be a reduction of growth and limited flowering and seed 
production in infested plants. It will take a year or more for infested plants 
to die. Control of bindweed over a large area can take years: be patient, mow, 
move mites manually and you will increase your chances of success.</p>

<p><b>Do something meaningful for mom</b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Back in the days when I was a new mom, I tried to do everything right. I 
breastfed, and responded to each and every cry with anxious alacrity. When my 
babies were ready for solid food, I cooked and pureed homegrown vegetables. I 
awoke early, and eschewing TV or personal pursuits, curled up on the couch with 
a stack of books that I could recite in my sleep (which I did). </p> 
<p>Was I trying too hard? No - I was a committed mother, eager to do right by 
my children. I was proud of the fact that I could get in a couple hours of 
high-intensity parenting before I left for work; prouder still that, when I 
came home in the evening, I could count on at least three more similarly 
intense hours to follow.</p> 
<p>I wasn't alone. I was surrounded, it seemed, by women who had surrendered 
themselves - and part of their sanity - to motherhood, women who pulled 
all-nighters hand-painting paper plates for a class party, who obsessed over 
the most minute details of play-group politics. Women who, like myself, 
appeared to be sleepwalking through life in a state of quiet panic.</p> 
<p>I read that 70 percent of American moms say they find motherhood today 
incredibly stressful. For many moms, work and motherhood becomes a juggling act 
- a very tough act.</p> 
<p>I no longer have children at home. My husband and I are at a stage in our 
lives where we dream of grandchildren - a much longed-for gift, when the time 
is right, from our children. But that dream is utterly incompatible with where 
our children are at in their lives.</p> 
<p>When my children were still at home, my life as a mother was very different 
from that of my own mother. She was a stay-at-home mom to ten children who 
lived in a state of virtual isolation because she couldn't afford any time for 
herself. Myself, with only two children, 10 years apart, I was able to work 
full time. Unlike my mother, and in a different age and culture, my husband 
shared in the responsibilities of child-raising. I don't need to valorize 
motherhood. I do wish to acknowledge, however, that it is the toughest job in 
the world and often thankless. Rewards - most definitely, but even then it's 
sometimes hard to see when you are in the trenches.</p> 
<p>Jenny, a full-time mom to two boys, ages five and three, put it so aptly as 
she huffs up the hill with her load in a double-occupancy baby jogger: &quot;I 
just want them to make something of themselves.&quot; A mission statement for 
motherhood. </p> 
<p>Looking back, I can see the challenges my mother faced and the sacrifices 
she made to give me and my nine other siblings a better life. When I was 
growing up, I didn't realize or appreciate how much my mother did for me and 
how her care made it possible for me to make something of myself.</p> 
<p>You have three days before Mother's Day, Sunday, to do something truly 
meaningful for your mother to appreciate the selfless love she offered to you 
and to understand the &quot;other&quot; existence she forwent in order to be 
the mom she was. Tell her often and plainly how much you love her.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Obituaries</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Irvin Peterson</b></p> 
<p>Irvin &quot;Ovie&quot; Peterson, who was born February 10, 1926, in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, has gone to meet his Lord on May 9, 2006.</p> 
<p>His love for life took him on many journeys. After serving two and a half 
years in the Navy at the end of World War II, Ovie returned home to Minneapolis 
and attended the Minneapolis School of Art where he graduated with a degree in 
industrial design. Shortly after his graduation, he moved with his wife Joan to 
San Diego, California, where he worked in the home construction industry for 
many years. In the late '50s, he returned to school and graduated with a 
teaching degree from San Diego State College. He spent the next 20 years 
teaching high school woodshop where he influenced and inspired many young men 
and women with his love of working and creating with wood.</p> 
<p>In 1981, Ovie and his wife of 57 years, Joan, moved to Pagosa Springs, 
where they dedicated their lives to their family, the community, and serving 
the Lord. While enjoying retirement, Ovie always stayed busy with many 
interesting adventures. He built the family home on Lake Pagosa in the early 
years of Pagosa Lakes development, and was always busy in some type of building 
project for friends and family. He and Joan also owned PG's ice cream shop and 
managed the Spring Inn for awhile. One of his favorite relaxing pastimes was 
playing horseshoes. He also spent many years as a volunteer for C.R.W.R.C. and 
the Red Cross in a Christian outreach and relief effort. No task was too large 
or too small for him.</p> 
<p>He adored his four children, Ken Peterson of Pagosa Springs, Kristi Brown 
and her husband Gary, of Temecula, California, Linda Gill and her husband Stan, 
of Pagosa Springs, Dan Peterson of Denver, and foster daughter Susie Hall and 
her husband Mike, of Pagosa Springs. He leaves a legacy of 13 grandchildren and 
2 great-grandchildren.</p> 
<p>The Christian life that Ovie lived in this community will leave many 
lasting memories for all of us that knew him. His commitment to a personal 
relationship with Jesus Christ was an inspiration to each of us. Although we 
shall miss him, we feel that his work on earth is finished and that he is now 
enjoying the sweet rest, joy and peace that Jesus Christ has prepared in heaven 
for all who love and serve Him.</p> 
<p>A memorial service celebrating his life, officiated by Al De Boer, will be 
held on Friday, May 12, 2006, at 11 a.m. at Restoration Fellowship in Pagosa 
Springs. Immediately following the service, there will be a time for fellowship 
with the family and friends.</p> 
<p>Memorial gifts maybe made in Ovie's honor to the Alzheimer's Association, 
701 Camino Del Rio, No. 319, Durango, CO 81301.</p> 
<p><b>John Romero Jr.</b></p> 
<p>John Romero Jr., &quot;Little John,&quot; age 48, passed away Friday, April 
21, 2006. He is survived by his wife, Cheri; daughters Lacey Sage Romero and 
Casey Reese; parents John and Cristy H. Romero; brothers Alex and Gary Romero; 
godchildren, Dion and Felina Romero; siblings Veronica, Sarah, Jasmine, 
Belinda, Maria, and Matthew.</p> 
<p>Memorial Services were held in Albuquerque, with burial at Mt. Calvary 
Cemetery on Wednesday, April 26, 2006. John, a member of Pagosa First Assembly 
of God Church, will always be remembered for his love in working with children, 
and will be greatly missed by all his friends and family.</p> 
<p><b>Joan Thomas</b></p> 
<p>Joan Lewis Thomas, 75 years young, entered eternal life peacefully Friday, 
April 21, 2006, after a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer.</p> 
<p>Joan was born Sept. 24, 1930, in Wilson, Okla., to Zelma and J.D. Lewis, 
whose loving arms welcomed her into heaven.</p> 
<p>She graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas and attended SMU 
and Mary Hardin-Baylor.</p> 
<p>She married her high school sweetheart, Otis Thomas, April 28, 1956, and 
began a new family together in Fort Worth.</p> 
<p>She wore many hats and served her Lord well through years in the United 
Methodist Women, where she served 10 years as president at her local church, as 
well as district offices and was chairman of the administrative board for five 
years.</p> 
<p>Joan was a member of DAR. Researching family genealogy was a favorite hobby 
she shared with her husband and daughter.</p> 
<p>Throughout her life, Joan had the gift of volunteering for schools, church 
and community services.</p> 
<p>Care Corp. will miss her commitment.</p> 
<p>Joan and Otis bought a home and property in the Blanco Basin in 1977. It 
was a favorite of the children and grandchildren during the summer, but Otis 
and Joan lived there full-time until the '90s when they left for a lower 
climate for health reasons.</p> 
<p>The family she loved and enjoyed included husband Otis Thomas; daughter 
Jackie Wommack and husband Gary; son Ronnie Thomas, all of Azle; daughter Janet 
Jones and husband Wes of Richland Hills; seven grandchildren; five 
great-grandchildren; favorite cousin and lifetime friend, Sue Jane Marutsky and 
husband Joe of Grand Junction.</p>

tile jobs. He began his career laying carpet and linoleum. He is very well 
known for his work on many homes in our area. He also worked with and has very 
good friends in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Jerry was an avid fisherman and hunter. He loved to go out on his boat with 
his girls and fished for countless hours to bring home many trophy largemouth 
bass and channel catfish.</p> 
<p>Jerry had been battling lung cancer since 2004. In 2004 he had the left 
side of his lung removed in Albuquerque. He then had chemo and was fine until 
February of this year. The cancer attacked his lung, liver, backbone and brain. 
He then went through radiation and was going to start his third treatment of 
chemo. He was hospitalized on May 1 due to complications of a collapsed lung. 
He was transported to the Pine Ridge Nursing Home for the last four hours of 
his life. He passed away with his daughters Danielle and Angela, plus with 
Jessie Cardoso, Dolores Gurule and Ramona Gurule, by his side.</p>

<p><b>Time to clean up community</b> </p> 
<p><b>By Mary Jo Coulehan</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>As always, it's a joy to work with the youth of this community. </p> 
<p>I would like to congratulate the three new winners of the Archuleta County 
Fair Royalty Pageant: Marissa Maddox - queen; Michelle Garcia - princess; Belle 
Zellner - junior princess. These ladies will represent our community at the 
Archuleta County Fair and numerous other activities throughout the year. Just 
about every month they participate in some community-sponsored event, learning 
to give back to the community in which they live. There is often a considerable 
amount of work involved, and I want to thank them for their efforts and want 
them to know Pagosa residents appreciate all their volunteerism.</p> 
<p>So, speaking of volunteering and youth, get ready for a wonderful couple of 
days dedicated to families and youth, sponsored by Seeds of Learning Child Care 
Center. At 6 p.m. Friday, May 12, head to the community center where a tasty 
dinner catered by Wildflower Catering will be served, at 40 differently 
designed tables for this &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; benefit dinner. There 
will be tables designed by businesses and creative individuals. Come dine at 
the Willy Wonka table created by Pagosa Candy Company. You can feast at the 
Alice in Wonderland table prepared by Cherlyn Gwin, who also creates beautiful 
and functional tea pots, French presses and cup cozies. The tables will then be 
auctioned off, from tablecloth up. You can walk home with your own fanciful or 
elegant table setting. Tickets for the event are $300 for a table of eight and 
$75 for two. There will also be a cash wine and beer bar. Get out of the 
ordinary dinner and fund-raising mode; come out for an evening of frolic and 
festivities while benefiting the Seeds of Learning Center. Individual tickets 
or whole tables are available at Seeds of Learning on San Juan Street through 
the day, today.</p> 
<p>Saturday, you can enjoy a full day of activities. Start at 11 a.m. in Town 
Park, where there will be games, face painting, flowers and plants just in time 
for Mother's Day, clowns, storybook characters, food and much more. Eddie 
Spaghetti will be on hand to sign autographs as well. Many of these events are 
free to the public. There are also activities set throughout the park that have 
fees associated with them. For these events, you can purchase a family pack of 
tickets for four for the whole day and evening at the Chamber, for $100. This 
price includes an Eddie Spaghetti CD. You can also purchase an individual 
all-day pass (including the dinner) for $25. Enjoy a soak at The Spa for your 
family, lunch, T-shirts and more fun activities included in your package price.
</p> 
<p>Park events continue until 4 p.m., giving everyone just enough time to get 
to the community center. Starting at 4:30 p.m., an Eddie Spaghetti concert and 
spaghetti dinner will take place. There will be an autograph signing and tons 
of singing and fun. If you can only attend the concert and dinner, tickets are 
$10 and may also be purchased at the Chamber or at the door.</p> 
<p>As the weather starts to warm up, this is a perfect time to get your family 
out, involved and together for a day of activities, music and dinner. What a 
nice gift to give mom for Mother's Day: a day off!</p>

<p><b>Pirates host Fountain Valley in soccer playoffs </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It's on.</p> 
<p>One game.</p> 
<p>Win, and you go on to another match.</p> 
<p>Lose, and the season is over.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Class 3A soccer playoffs have begun. There are 16 teams in the 
running and the Pagosa Pirates (9-3-1), the No. 8 seed, take on No. 9 Fountain 
Valley (11-2-1), of Colorado Springs, Friday at 4 p.m. at Golden Peaks Stadium.
</p> 
<p>On paper, it appears the teams are well matched.</p> 
<p>The Pirates won the Southwestern league title this season. The Danes placed 
second in the Tri Peaks League, behind Manitou Springs.</p> 
<p>&quot;They have a very good team,&quot; said Pirate Coach Lindsey 
Kurt-Mason, &quot;And so do we.&quot;</p> 
<p>The teams surge into the first round of the playoffs, emerging out of 
similar leagues and schedules.</p> 
<p>&quot;They played a couple 4-A teams,&quot; said Kurt-Mason of the Danes, 
&quot;and so did we. With similar results. Their league is similar to ours - 
both feature a couple strong teams that are head and shoulders above the rest 
of the league. They are pretty much like us.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Danes feature a prolific scorer in Wrendy Rayhill, who has 26 goals and 
20 assists this season. And Fountain Valley features a stout defense, putting 
three consecutive shutouts on the books to date.</p> 
<p>Pagosa can score too, however, (Laurel Reinhardt has 24 goals on the 
season) and the Pirate defense should be a big factor in Friday's match.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our defense has been solid in practice during the last week,&quot; 
said the coach. &quot;And I think defense will be a key in this game. I 
wouldn't expect a high-scoring affair; I look for tight game, with little 
scoring.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Pirates have had more than a week off and Kurt-Mason said he has worked 
his charges hard in preparation for the playoffs. &quot;We've gone hard-easy 
this week,&quot; he said, expecting one last tough practice Wednesday before 
giving his players a rest. &quot;We did speed work Tuesday and the kids are 
tired. But, with a day's rest, they'll be ready.&quot;</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason reported his starters &quot;are all healthy&quot; (Kailey 
Smith's broken nose being the only notable injury - and not enough to keep her 
out of action) and ready for competition.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's pretty much an even match,&quot; said the coach.</p>

<p><b>Pirates place at league meet, set for regionals </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Pirates track teams finished well at last week's Intermountain League 
championship meet at Bayfield, but coaches and athletes alike expect bigger 
things at Saturday's regional meet.</p> 
<p>The Pirate boys took second in the IML standings with 106 points, behind 
Bayfield (137.67). Pirate girls (91) finished third, behind winner Bayfield 
(107) and Centauri (98).</p> 
<p>A number of top-three finishes paced boys' results.</p> 
<p>Corbin Mellette won the IML title in the 100-meter dash, finishing the race 
in 12 seconds.</p> 
<p>Pirates finished one-two in the 400. Gunnar Gill won the race in 53.89; 
Chase Moore took second place at 56.67.</p> 
<p>Travis Furman was third in the 800, finishing in 2:12.39.</p> 
<p>Freshman Jackson Walsh had another good day in the 3,200. He finished third 
in the IML with a time of 10:56.88.</p> 
<p>In the 110-meter hurdles, Brian Patane crossed the line at 17.46, good for 
second place.</p> 
<p>The 4x400 relay team of Patane, Gill, Mellette and Mike Smith was second, 
in 46.74.</p> 
<p>The boys' 4x400 relay of Gill, Moore, Furman and Orion Sandoval ran the 
race in 3:42.33, for second place. </p> 
<p>Moore, Furman, Sandoval and A.J. Abeyta were second in the 4x800 relay, in 
8:40.61.</p> 
<p>In field events, junior Caleb Ormonde had a big day. Ormonde won the high 
jump at 6 feet, two inches. He also won the triple jump at 40-6 and took second 
in long jump, leaping 19-3.5.</p> 
<p>Pirates were first and third in discus. Craig Schutz is the IML champ, with 
a throw of 146-11. Zane Kraetsch took third with 110-06.</p> 
<p>For the girls, Mia Caprioli was the sole first-place finisher in an 
individual track event. The senior took the title in the 100, at 13.74.</p> 
<p>Junior Kim Fulmer nailed two second-place finishes at the meet. She ran the 
200 in 29.34 and the 400 in 62.33.</p> 
<p>Emilie Schur was second in the 800, with a time of 2:25.88.</p> 
<p>Jaclyn Harms finished third in the 3,200, at 12:59.07.</p> 
<p>Chelsea Cooper was third in the 300 hurdles, at 51.45.</p> 
<p>Girls' relay teams ended the meet with three firsts, a second and third.</p>
<p>The 4x400 team of Fulmer, Schur, Jessica Low and Elise McDonald was first, 
at 4:23.81.</p> 
<p>Schur, Fulmer, Jessica Lynch and Jenni Webb-Shearston ran a 10:08.8 for 
first in the 4x800, 19 seconds ahead of second-place Centauri.</p> 
<p>Caprioli, Low, McDonald and Lyndsey Mackey took first in the 800 sprint 
medley with a time of 1:59.87. </p> 
<p>Second in the 4x200 went to Caprioli, Lynch, Low and Stephanie Lowe with a 
time of 1:51.94.</p> 
<p>The team of Mackey, Low Caprioli and Lowe was third in the 4x100, at 54:47.
</p> 
<p>&quot;The boys' four-by-one hundred was extremely close to 
qualifying,&quot; said Coach Connie O'Donnell. &quot;If they get their handoffs 
down, hopefully, they'll qualify this weekend.&quot;</p> 
<p>O'Donnell singled out Ormonde for his performances at Bayfield. The Pirate 
won the high jump, equalling his personal best of 6 feet, 2 inches. He also won 
the triple jump in a personal-best performance, and posted yet another personal 
best in long jump.</p> 
<p>The coach recognized that freshmen Walsh and Kyle Brookins had a great day. 
Both took significant time off their 3,200-meter times - a feat rare among 
underclassmen.</p> 
<p>Despite the third-place league finish, O'Donnell is upbeat about the girls' 
prospects at regionals. The third place came with one notable competitor absent 
from the track and O'Donnell said she is &quot;very excited about our girls' 
chances to make it to state. At the regional seeding meeting, it was obvious we 
have a lot of girls on the verge of making it. At regionals, the top three in 
each event go to state (as well as those who have posted qualifying times 
earlier in the season). We have a good chance to get quite a few of our kids 
qualified. We were missing a major point earner at the league meet in Nikki 
Kinkead, but I was very impressed with the attitude our girls had. It didn't 
phase them.&quot;</p> 
<p>The coach attributed much of that positive attitude to good team 
leadership, in particular from senior Mia Caprioli. &quot;Mia has become a very 
good leader,&quot; said O'Donnell. &quot;She's been to state two times and 
really wants to go back. She's a hard worker, and she encourages people at 
practice.&quot;</p> 
<p>Lynch also drew comments from her coach. &quot;Jessica almost qualified in 
the four hundred. She was a tenth off and she ran a very tough race.&quot;</p> 
<p>Saturday's regional meet at Bayfield will be a proving ground for many of 
the Pirates.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm hoping we get most of our boys' relays to state - at least three 
of four,&quot; said the coach. &quot;We should do well in the field events and, 
maybe, we'll qualify someone in each event.&quot;</p> 
<p>On the girls' side, O'Donnell sees some stiff competition. Bayfield, the 
IML winner, will be at the meet, as will Centauri. Salida, Buena Vista and Lake 
County will be there as well. &quot;Salida has some tough girls,&quot; said the 
coach. &quot;And so does Bayfield and Centauri. I think we can fight our way 
back. We're missing just a few points in a few places. There's a couple of 
events where we'll have two pretty good contenders. I love this weekend; it's 
one of my favorites in track. I love the competition; character comes out at 
this meet and it takes a lot of heart to do well. People want to get to state, 
and they go all out.&quot;</p> 
<p>Field events are set to start at 10 a.m. Saturday at Bayfield. Track events 
will begin at noon.</p> 
<p><b>Pirates' season ends with 10-inning loss </b></p> 
<p><b>By Randy Johnson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Pirates had to play Monte Vista for a third time in less 
than five days in the Intermountain League district baseball tournament held on 
the Monte Vista field last Saturday.</p> 
<p>Based on tournament seeding, they were matched up again, and the 
fourth-place Pirates would have to meet No. 1-seeded Monte.</p> 
<p>Pagosa was hoping the third time would be the charm. It didn't turn out 
that way, but it sure came close.</p> 
<p>The Pirates came with swords drawn and a slightly different look on 
defense. Coach Charlie Gallegos moved Casey Hart to third base and Cody Bahn to 
second. The rest of the infield stayed the same with seniors Jim Guyton and 
Josh Hoffman at first-base and shortstop respectively. Adam Trujillo was on the 
mound and John Hoffman behind the plate. The outfield consisted of Wes Walters 
in left, Travis Richey in center and Matt Gallegos in right.</p> 
<p>The Pirates (10-10, 3-6 in IML) fought hard but finally fell in 10 long 
innings to the hard hitting hosts (15-6, 9-1 in IML). Third baseman Jacob Jaron 
hit a two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the tenth inning to win it 
10-8. The win put Monte in the championship game later that day. The loss sent 
Pagosa home.</p> 
<p>Monte Vista went on to defeat the Ignacio Bobcats 14-4 for the league title 
and advance to the 3A state tournament this weekend. The second-place Bobcats 
also advanced after they defeated the Bayfield Wolverines 17-14 in other first 
round action.</p> 
<p>The Pirates played like a different team but still found themselves down 
4-0 after four innings. Sigi Rodriquez, on the mound for Monte, was throwing a 
no-hitter and had Pagosa baffled at the plate until the top of the fifth inning 
when they finally came up with two runs. The Pirates would tie it at five in 
the top of the seventh and then they matched scores until Jaron's hit to end it.
</p> 
<p>There was also a play for the highlight films. Rodriquez slammed what 
appeared to be the game-winning home run over the left-center field fence in 
the bottom of the 10th. The umpire called a balk on Richey, pitching in relief 
for Pagosa, and the run was called off. Rodriquez walked and then Jaron came to 
bat.</p> 
<p>If the Pirates were the home team and batting last, they probably would 
have won it ... but that's baseball.</p> 
<p>Coach Gallegos was proud of the way his team played. &quot;We fought hard 
all day and probably played our best game this season. Our kids came to play 
and it was a real team effort.&quot;</p> 
<p>The coach added, &quot;Rodriquez was pitching a great game and (Monte) was 
hitting the ball well, but we kept our poise and didn't let up. It's too bad 
there had to be a loser in a game like this. I was sorry for our seniors to 
have their season end, but we will dedicate next year to them.&quot; The 
Pirates lose only two to graduation and will add several from a good junior 
varsity squad.</p> 
<p>Pagosa went three and out in the top of the first inning. Then Jaron jacked 
his first two-RBI homer in the bottom half to put the yellow and green up 2-0.
</p> 
<p>Designated hitter Karl Hujus, still nursing a sore ankle, reached first on 
a passed ball for Pagosa to open the second inning, but Rodriquez sent three 
more Pirates down in order.</p> 
<p>Monte second baseman David Salazar reached base in their half of the 
second, but was tagged out after a nice pick-off throw from Trujillo to Guyton.
</p> 
<p>Two Pirates reached base in the top of the third inning. Trujillo walked 
and Bahn outran a bad throw to first, but both were left on base.</p> 
<p>Michael Salazar, playing right-field and batting ninth, hit a long double 
to center to open the Monte third. Shortstop Robert Montoya reached base on an 
error and Salazar scored to put Monte up 3-0.</p> 
<p>Rodriquez continued to pitch shutout ball for Monte Vista through the top 
of the fourth inning after Hujus reached first on a walk, but was left stranded 
again.</p> 
<p>Jaron walked to open Monte's half of the fourth inning. Two sacrifices put 
him on third and he scored on a passed-ball to increase the lead to four.</p> 
<p>The Pirates finally started hitting in the fifth to score two. Guyton and 
Trujillo both singled, then scored on passed-ball pitches to cut the lead to 
4-2.</p> 
<p>Cliff Shaw, playing at first-base, singled for Monte Vista to lead off the 
bottom half of the fifth, but two good defensive plays by Pagosa ended the 
inning.</p> 
<p>Rodriquez seemed to be tiring and walked three Pirates to load the bases in 
the top of the sixth, but rebounded with two straight outs to end the inning 
with three left on.</p> 
<p>Monte would score another in sixth on another long home run to left-field 
by catcher Matt Gonzales and the score went 5-2 for the home team.</p> 
<p>Josh Hoffman, leading off in the seventh, doubled to left for the black and 
gold. John Hoffman walked to put two on. Hart singled to left and the bases 
were loaded. Rodriquez walked two runs in and Richey sacrificed for an RBI. The 
scored was tied at five.</p> 
<p>Trujillo pitched another good inning for the Pirates, allowing just one hit 
and regulation play ended with the score 5-5.</p> 
<p>Trujillo helped himself in the first extra inning by beating out a hard 
shot that bounced off the pitcher's leg. Josh Hoffman also beat out the throw 
to first that advanced Trujillo to third, who then scored on a passed-ball. 
John Hoffman reached base on an error and the Pirates took their first lead of 
the game at 7-5 with only one earned run.</p> 
<p>The hosts showed their hard hitting again in the bottom of the eighth. 
Kyler Cooper, playing in center field, started the inning with a home run. 
Coach Gallegos brought Richey in to relieve Trujillo and sophomore Cole 
Kraetsch went to right field. Rodriquez walked and Jaron sacrificed him in to 
tie the score again at 7-7.</p> 
<p>Both teams went three and out in the ninth inning and it appeared this one 
might never end.</p> 
<p>Kraetsch, in his first at-bat in a varsity game, calmly jacked one over the 
right-field fence in the top of the 10th to give the Buccaneers the lead.</p> 
<p>And then Monte came to bat.</p> 
<p>And a season came to an end. </p>

<p></p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Create the codes </b> </p> 
<p>There are times to put on the brakes, pull over, take a deep breath, get 
your bearings, figure out the route. Such was the case two weeks ago with the 
reaction of county government to a proposed, large-scale development: Keep the 
speed down, take a gander at the possibilities and the probable consequences.
</p> 
<p>Not to say we advocate a halt to development. But, when the change proposed 
is massive, there is a line between governmental control, community impact and 
private property rights in need of illumination, a zone of compromise that must 
be recognized. With regulations in hand.</p> 
<p>Lacking refined land-use regulations and tools, and concrete planning 
strategies that mirror a well-conceived community vision, it is sometimes 
difficult to determine where that zone is.</p> 
<p>Thus it is we applaud the April 18 decision by the county commission to, in 
effect, put the brakes on a proposed &quot;low-income&quot; or 
&quot;affordable&quot; housing project on Piedra Road. </p> 
<p>Not because it was &quot;low-income&quot; or &quot;affordable.&quot; But, 
because the plan was ill conceived - too much, in too little space, with too 
much potential negative impact. </p> 
<p>Granted, there is a need for affordable housing. And that need could 
increase in the immediate future. It is something that must addressed. But not 
in this form, this size, in this place. And not without workable regulations in 
hand to deal with the proposal.</p> 
<p>One argument in favor was that such a development will ultimately be in 
someone's &quot;backyard&quot; and that, as a result, someone will gripe no 
matter where the development is located. Therefore, went the argument, the 
project should be built.</p> 
<p>It is an argument in which one premise is true: Build a 112-unit, 
seven-building complex anywhere in the county where land prices permit such a 
venture to profit and someone will complain. But, the argument pays no heed to 
the fact that not all backyards are the same. We must discriminate between 
neighborhoods, and the effect a project will have. The effect differs relative 
to location and this location was wrong; there are not 112 living units within 
a half-mile radius of the proposed location. The traffic situation and the 
impact on existing roadways and intersections would be unacceptable. The impact 
on the adjacent neighborhood would have been dramatic, and harsh. The 
environmental impact - considering this site is, in effect, part of a large 
drainage and at the entry of one of the major lakes in the area - could have 
been extreme.</p> 
<p>The vote put an end, at least temporarily, to plans for such an 
unacceptably large project in that spot. </p> 
<p>It shouldn't have come to that. The tools that would have allowed plans to 
be halted or changed at a lower administrative level are not yet in place in 
the county. We are paying the price for a lack of foresight on the part of 
community leaders 50, 30, 25 years ago. Proof again we need to amp up the 
process of creating and implementing regulations so we do not leave utter 
wreckage for those to come.</p> 
<p>Until the means are in hand to deal with large-scale development (and, 
here, we are not talking about several downtown lots, but rather about hundreds 
of units, on major acreage) all such projects should be put on hold. At least 
the town has made a step in the right direction with passage of its 
Comprehensive Plan. But the county is not yet there.</p> 
<p>There are hearings coming soon on the topic of county land use codes.</p> 
<p>There is still time left for those interested to get involved.</p> 
<p>There are places for developers to put large-scale housing projects, where 
they will work to the greatest good. There must be; if growth continues, we 
will need them. But, for now, we must codify the processes that allow us to put 
them where they will fit best.</p>

<p><b>Heroes in Our Midst: Carlos Trujillo, Korean War veteran</b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Collins</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;I wanted to go in and do my part,&quot; said Carlos Trujillo, a 
74-year-old, third-generation Pagosa Springs native.</p> 
<p>Trujillo began his active service in 1951, when he volunteered for service 
in the Korean War in the 25th Infantry Division, 14th Company L.</p> 
<p>After just eight weeks of basic training, Trujillo found himself three 
miles in front of the main line resistance, on the infamous Hill 351.</p> 
<p>&quot;The tanks would come in and fire, and we'd move in to get (hit with) 
all the artillery,&quot; recalls Trujillo.</p> 
<p>After weeks of fighting, Trujillo's company would be pulled back for 
&quot;rest and recuperation,&quot; although there was not much rest to be found 
between training and drills. Always near the front, along the 38th parallel, 
Trujillo battled in the Punch Bowl and on Heartbreak Ridge, as well as Hill 351.
</p> 
<p>Trujillo spent 11 months on the front lines, &quot;living in trenches and 
bunkers,&quot; and witnessing ravages of war that are difficult for him to 
speak of, even 50 years later.</p> 
<p>&quot;To this day, I don't watch war movies,&quot; stated Trujillo. &quot;I 
remember one time on Hill 351, we had our 'whites' over us. All of a sudden, 
they pounded us - shell after shell after shell. We lost quite a few of our 
brothers over there. It was just terrible to see all the wounded, the soldiers 
begging for help and crying.&quot;</p> 
<p>Trujillo met another Pagosa Springs native while on the front lines in 
Korea: &quot;We were on Hill 351,&quot; he said, &quot; and North Korea and 
China broke through the front lines. They sent tanks and half-tracks and trucks 
to get us out. After I loaded up onto a truck, I saw someone I recognized.</p> 
<p>&quot;I hollered out, 'Archuleta!' He turned around and came closer to me, 
and I saw that it was Waldo Archuleta,&quot; said Trujillo. &quot;It was a real 
joy to see someone from my home town.&quot;</p> 
<p>Trujillo and Archuleta were able to visit with each other for about five 
minutes before Trujillo was sent back to the front, as the line had been 
secured. Archuleta was a member of the 77th tank battalion. The two soldiers 
renewed their friendship after the war, at home in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>By 1952, Trujillo had earned enough points to be pulled back from the front 
or to return to the United States. He returned stateside and was based at Camp 
Carson, Colo. After 21 months of active duty, Trujillo was issued an early 
discharge.</p> 
<p>The armistice was signed in 1953, but Trujillo felt as though he had not 
given enough for this country that he loves, and just three months after his 
discharge, he reenlisted in the 11th Airborne Division, 503rd Infantry 
Regiment. Trujillo was trained as a paratrooper and completed more than 70 
successful jumps.</p> 
<p>Trujillo was placed in a special platoon that was given the task of testing 
equipment, such as sleeping bags, in Alaska. &quot;We had good clothing in 
Alaska,&quot; said Trujillo. &quot;Not like we had in Korea.</p> 
<p>&quot;The service has done a lot for me,&quot; stated Trujillo. &quot;I've 
been places I never would've seen. I've been all over the world. Being in the 
military for seven years gave me so much discipline. It really helped me in 
life, and to understand what was happening in the world.</p> 
<p>&quot;I wonder, 'Why me? Why am I here and all my other friends are 
gone?'&quot; Trujillo remembered friends of years past with a wistfulness in 
his voice. &quot;God must have me here for a reason,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>After seven years in the service, Trujillo met his wife, Clorinda 
(Gallegos) Trujillo, also a Pagosa Springs native. &quot;I was planning on 
making a career of the military when I met my wife,&quot; said Trujillo with a 
smile. He exited the military as a sergeant first class. He and Clorinda 
celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary this year. They have two living adult 
children as well as grandchildren residing in Pagosa Springs - now the fifth 
generation to call the Four Corners home.</p> 
<p>&quot;My dad came over Wolf Creek Pass in covered wagons,&quot; said 
Trujillo. &quot;They had to lower the wagons on ropes down the steepest parts, 
and lead the horses on foot.&quot; Trujillo had 15 siblings. &quot;We were 
raised up here sawmilling, ranching and herding sheep.&quot;</p> 
<p>Of his eight brothers, all but one - due to work-related disability - 
served in the military: four in World War II, Trujillo in Korea, and two in 
Vietnam. All came home without injury.</p> 
<p>&quot;I was really proud to serve in the military. It really made a 
difference in my life,&quot; said Trujillo. &quot;Even though I'm Spanish, I'm 
American first. I think every young man should spend at least two years in the 
military.&quot;</p> 
<p>Trujillo continues to keep in touch with men who served with him in the 
11th Airborne Division, and his commitment to the United States remains as 
strong as when it first led him into active duty. &quot;I wanted to get in 
again when we jumped into Iraq. The recruiter said, 'No way!'&quot; said 
Trujillo with patriotism shining in his eyes.</p> 
<p>&quot;Life is what you make of it,&quot; added Trujillo. &quot;Life has 
been good to me, thanks be to God. I don't regret for one moment the time I 
spent in the military.&quot;</p> 
<p>Trujillo represents a generation whose heart beats true with a love of 
family and of country. The men and women of his day and age offered of 
themselves utterly and completely, to secure a hope in the life Americans dream 
to achieve.</p> 
<p>Thanks to Trujillo and others like him, future generations are free to 
dream the desires of their hearts.</p> 
<p></p> <b>Pagosa's Past</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Wirt held great power south of Pagosa Country </b></p> 
<p><b>By John Motter</b></p> 
<p>For several weeks, we have been reporting from accounts of the life of 
Emmet Wirt, credited with saving the Jicarilla Apache Nation from starvation 
and helping that people convert from a hunting-gathering economy to a body self 
sufficient in today's economy.</p> 
<p>Our first source was J. Denton Simms, long time pastor of the Reformed 
Church in Dulce and father of the boy who married Wirt's daughter. As you would 
expect, Simms's account was very flattering.</p> 
<p>Last week, we began reporting from a book titled, &quot;The Jicarilla 
Apache Tribe, A History, 1846-1970,&quot; by Veronica E. Velarde Tiller, an 
Apache Ph.D. Dr. Tiller, I understand, operates a financial consulting company.
</p> 
<p>Last week we reported that Morris Opler, an anthropologist who did much 
work on the reservation during 1933-34, saw Wirt as owning a virtual 
stranglehold on Apache finances and even on Bureau of Indian Affairs policies.
</p> 
<p>After learning of Opler's report, BIA Commissioner John Collier ordered 
Field Representative Louis Balsam to investigate Opler's claims. Balsam was a 
bit more poignant and blunt in his findings than Opler had been.</p> 
<p>He wrote that Wirt's power rested on a rather strong base; his ability to 
get what he wanted from congressmen and governors, for this reason he 
encountered no opposition.</p> 
<p>According to Balsam, it was Wirt himself who told him, &quot;When Grave (a 
former agency superintendent) left I began to worry that they might send me a 
crackpot down here as superintendent, so I wrote Faris a letter to be sure we 
got the right kind. Faris did not answer so to make sure I had Jack Dempsey, 
the Senator, go in to see Mr. Collier. Right away Dempsey wrote me that he had 
seen the Commissioner and that no one would be appointed Superintendent here 
who did not meet with my approval.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another story that Wirt told Balsam that illustrated his power had to do 
with the money advanced to the Jicarillas in the aftermath of the severe winter 
of 1931. Wirt and Graves, so the story went, had gone to Washington and 
obtained an outright grant. &quot;Mr. Graves has said that due entirely to my 
pressure upon Senator Sam Bratton and Commissioner Rhoads a bill was put 
through Congress giving Mr. Graves the power to spend that $80,000 free and 
without red tape as he saw fit. Mr. Graves then turned the bulk over to me and 
I personally went out and bought sheep for him. Within two years the Indians 
had paid off my debt.&quot;</p> 
<p>Continuing to quote Tiller, we read, &quot;The reports of Opler and Balsam 
perhaps had some truth in them, although interestingly, their opinions are in 
direct contrast to those popularly held about Wirt. Occasionally, similar views 
are found in pre-1934 inspection reports. Faris perhaps best reflected what 
Jicarillas and former associates of Wirt preferred to think.</p> 
<p>Faris sums it up this way: &quot;The story of the Jicarilla cannot be 
divorced from Emmet Wirt. He came to the reservation in 1889. He was gruff and 
determined to the outside, but there is an interchange of understanding and 
sympathy with the Indians.&quot;</p> 
<p>More next week on Emmet Wirt, trader to the Jicarilla Apaches. </p>

<p>Depending on your point of view, this weekend's near-Earth passage of Comet 
73P Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW3) means either firestorms, tsunamis and the 
annihilation of humankind, or it is simply another relatively routine 
astronomical event to add to the astronomical history books.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are very well acquainted with the trajectory of Comet 73P 
Schwassmann-Wachmann 3,&quot; said Donald Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near Earth 
Object Program Office. &quot;There is absolutely no danger to people on the 
ground or the inhabitants of the International Space Station, as the main body 
of the object and any pieces from the breakup will pass many millions of miles 
beyond the Earth.&quot;</p> 
<p>But Frenchman Eric Julien is not convinced, and he, and others like him, 
believe SW3's breakup and near-Earth passage mean the end of the world.</p> 
<p>According to Julien, who claims to have regular telepathic contact with 
extraterrestrials, the 1995 fragmentation of SW3 was the work of a race of 
malevolent extraterrestrials responding to the United States' nuclear program 
and the then burgeoning Star Wars defense system. Both of which, Julien 
asserts, pose a direct threat to their national security.</p> 
<p>In effect, Julien says, the extraterrestrials caused SW3's 1995 
fragmentation and sent scores of galactic ice hunks hurtling toward earth in an 
effort to thwart the United States' global and galactic hegemony.</p> 
<p>And although Julien concurs with Yeomans that the largest comet fragment 
will pass by Earth without incident, Julien asserts it is a small , truck-sized 
hunk that will strike Earth, causing tsunamis, underwater volcanic chain 
reactions and the destruction of life on Earth as we know it.</p> 
<p>Julien says, after further telepathic consultation with his 
extraterrestrial friends, May 25 is the day of reckoning.</p> 
<p>NASA scientists don't see things quite the same way.</p> 
<p>In 1930, German astronomers Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachmann 
discovered the comet as it passed within 5.8 million miles of Earth - roughly 
24 times the Earth-moon distance - and calculated its 5.5-year orbital period . 
Following their initial discovery, the comet was lost from view until 1979. On 
its subsequent voyage around the sun in 1984-1985, researchers missed the comet 
again, but on its next journey, astronomers locked it in their sights and have 
tracked it ever since, including its spectacular 1995 fragmentation.</p> 
<p>Since SW3's fragmentation, the comet has been comprised of a chain of 
fragments, named alphabetically, stretching across several degrees of the sky. 
To date, there are more than 40 fragments zipping through space, the largest of 
which is fragment C.</p> 
<p>Astronomers estimate fragment C, will pass closest to Earth May 12 at a 
distance of roughly 7.3 million miles, while the smaller fragments' passage 
will peak from May 12-28 at a distance of roughly 5.5 million miles - more than 
20 times the distance between the Earth and moon.</p> 
<p>In astronomical terms, SW3's passage is close, but it is not the only 
object in space on a near-Earth trajectory. As of May 5, NASA researchers at 
the Near Earth Object Program have catalogued 4,056 other Near-Earth Objects - 
objects, such as asteroids or comets which have been nudged by gravitational 
forces into Earth's neighborhood. Of the objects identified, 834 are asteroids 
with a diameter of one kilometer or larger, and 785 have been classified as 
Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.</p> 
<p>An analysis of the data collected by the program indicates the universe is 
abuzz with asteroids, comets, and other celestial debris, much of which 
occasionally passes close to our own planet. And in fact, comet SW3 is not the 
first comet astronomers have watched shatter.</p> 
<p>In July 1992, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was ripped to pieces by Jupiter's 
gravity, and astronomers watched two years later, as fragments of the comet 
pummeled Jupiter's atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Observations of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 event indicated to astronomers that 
comet fragmentation is probably fairly routine due to the physical structure 
and chemical composition of a comet's nucleus.</p> 
<p>According to astronomers, a comet's nucleus is a porous, relatively fragile 
mix of dust and ice, that undergoes tremendous stress as it races through the 
universe. Due to their relatively fragile nature, astronomers believe comets 
can be ripped apart by gravitational forces, such as when Shoemaker-Levy 9 
passed near Jupiter, or they can fly apart due to the rapid rotation of the 
nucleus. Other disintegration theories include break up caused by thermal 
stress when a comet passes near the sun, or disintegration caused by an 
explosion created by an outburst of trapped volatile gasses.</p> 
<p>&quot;Catastrophic breakups may be the ultimate fate of most comets,&quot; 
said planetary astronomer Hal Weaver of the John Hopkins University Applied 
Physics Laboratory. Weaver used the Hubble Space Telescope to study the 
disintegration of Shoemaker- Levy 9.</p> 
<p>Unlike Julien, it appears NASA astronomers are not predicting the end of 
the world. And in fact, many may be working around the clock with a variety of 
observational equipment, including the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes and 
the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars to record the event.</p> 
<p>Spectral analysis of the cometary fragments, can provide insights into the 
early physical and chemical make-up of the solar system.</p> 
<p>For the backyard, or naked-eye astronomer, viewing SW3's passage presents 
an opportunity to be a part of astronomical history.</p> 
<p>On May 12, fragment C and a variety of other fragments will pass within 7.3 
million miles of Earth, this is closer than any comet's passage since 1983. 
Although, fragment C is currently at magnitude seven, which is just dimmer than 
the naked eye threshold, the fragment may increase in brightness as it makes 
its near-Earth passage. Fragment C will be visible in small telescopes and with 
binoculars as it travels near the constellation Vulpecula located within the 
Summer Triangle asterism marked by the stars Vega, Altair and Deneb - best 
views should be had in the early morning hours.</p> 
<p>From May 12-28, the comet will pass through the Summer Triangle and by May 
17 will be found to the south and west near the Great Square of Pegasus. Again, 
the early morning hours may provide the best viewing opportunities during the 
latter portion of the comet's passage.</p>
