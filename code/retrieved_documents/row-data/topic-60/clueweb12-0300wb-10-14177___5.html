Introducing Orlando Dunkman: Make him shoot, pass and of course dunk!</b> <br>

<br> Immortal moments. <br>
<br>
Rivers, the Winter Park High grad and arguably 
the greatest prep basketball player in Orlando history, walked onto the court 
at the University ofNorth Carolina's Dean Dome Wednesday night as a Duke 
freshman.<br>
<br>
 He walked off as an ACC legend. <br>
<br>
 The son of former
Magic and current Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, Austin scored 29 points and 
buried a buzzer-beating game-winning 3-pointer against the No. 5-ranked Tar 
Heels that already has etched his name in the annals of the hallowed Duke-North 
Carolina rivalry.<br>
<br>
 Let me put it in a way helmet-headed UF fans will 
understand: Rivers' deep trey over the outstretched arms of UNC 7-footerTyler 
Zeller is the basketball equivalent of Tim Tebow's jump pass against LSU. <br>

<br> The shot is already being talked about with the same reverence as great 
Duke-Carolina shots of yesteryear &mdash;Danny Ferry's 75-footer at the buzzer 
orJerry Stackhouse's dramatic dunk over Cherokee Parks or Chris Duhon's reverse 
layup. SportsCenter has replayed it over and over and from every angle. Your 
eyes are glued to the screen as the high, arcing ball drops through the hoop 
and your ears are assaulted as Dukie, er, Dickie Vee screams, &quot;Oh! Oh! 
Unbelievable!&quot;<br>
<br>
 It happened on college basketball's biggest 
platform and in college basketball's most storied rivalry. And this is exactly 
what Austin envisioned when he backed off his oral commitment to sign withBilly 
Donovan's Gators and instead signed with Coach K and Duke. <br>
<br>
 &quot;I 
liked Florida, but you only get one chance to get it right,&quot; Austin told 
me last year, a few days after leading Winter Park High to its second 
consecutive big-school state championship. &quot;There's no better stage than 
the Duke stage.&quot;<br>
<br>
 This is not an indictment of Donovan's program. 
In fact, you could even call it an endorsement of what Donovan has 
accomplished. The fact that Billy D. has built an elite college basketball 
program in a state where the sport is largely ignored is incredible. It is why 
I believe Donovan is the greatest coach &mdash; either football or basketball 
&mdash; in this state's history. Many coaches have won football national titles 
in this state, but only one has won a national title in basketball. And Donovan 
has not won just one; he has won two.<br>
<br>
 Yes, Donovan gets his share of 
top recruits, but nothing like the revolving door of McDonald's All-Americans 
on the rosters forMike Krzyzewski at Duke and Roy Williams at North Carolina. 
Donovan can coach with the best of the best, but one thing he will never be 
able to overcome is history and heritage.<br>
<br>
 College basketball just 
matters more at Duke than it does in Florida just as college football matters 
more at Florida than it does at Duke. It's nobody's fault; it's just the way 
fans were brought up.<br>
<br>
 In 30 years, old-timers along Tobacco Road will 
be puffing on their Marlboros and still be talking about Rivers' shot against 
North Carolina Wednesday night. Now let's rewind to the previous night when the 
Gators playedKentucky in Rupp Arena. If Rivers had made that same buzzer-beater 
to defeat the No. 1-ranked Wildcats and end their 48-game home winning streak, 
you know what Gators fans would be talking about today? They'd be talking about 
whether Will Muschamp can landMaryland prep product Stefon Diggs, the No. 2 
wide receiver prospect in the country, according to Rivals.com<br>
<br>
 
Football has always been king in theSEC, but never more than it is now. Back in 
the 1980s and '90s &mdash; when Charles Barkley,Shaq and others were roaming 
the hardwood &mdash; SEC basketball was much better across the board than it is 
today. There was actually a time in the 1990s whenAlabama had more players in 
theNBA than North Carolina and Duke. <br>
<br>
 With six straight national 
championships and counting, SEC football now casts a more enormous shadow than 
ever before. Not that SEC schools don't invest millions in their basketball 
programs, but all thatBCS money simply cannot buy passion, emotion and devotion.
<br> <br>
 Speaking selfishly, it would have been great for local sports fans 
(and writers) if Austin Rivers had decided to stay in-state to play college 
basketball, but it's now easy to see why he made the decision he did.<br>
<br>
 
At UF, his shot would have been one of the best in Gators history.<br>
<br>
 At 
Duke, it's now one of the greatest in college basketball lore.<br>

<p>I am a Gator fan, but how many NBA guards has Billy D developed outside of 
Jason Williams. &nbsp;Nelson, Dupay, Roberson, Green, and Calathes never made 
it to the NBA or had minimal impact. &nbsp; &nbsp;All were prominent players 
before coming to UF.</p> <b>denhunter1</b> at 5:58 PM February 10, 2012 
<p>Please remember that Bitchanci doesn't REALLY watch or understand college 
basketball. First, Rivers is a ball hog and a team cancer. He is generally 
considered a punk with a big ego cause Daddie's rich.&nbsp;How many shots did 
he take in that game? Second, he wasn't guarded. Zeller fell out of position, 
and got his hands up too late or Rivers would still have ball in his teeth.</p> 
<p>North Carolina and Puke aren't a big deal this year. It was just a game, 
though ESPN wants to sell it as much as the can, and 60 percent of ESPN 
employees WENT to UNC or Puke. Indiana's lucky shot against Kentucky was the 
shot of&nbsp; the year.</p> 
<p>Remember when Bitchanci said that the Gators were 'the Roman Empire of 
college basketball', and their dynasty would live for decades?&nbsp; Please. He 
barely knows football. Don't stretch his brain.</p> <b>RubenGarzon</b> at 4:26

<p>Duke basketball ain't all that, they get the top recruits every year, but 
since Billy Donovan took over the Gators basketball program in 1996, Florida 
and Duke has the same amount of NCAA Championships.&nbsp; So Florida has done 
more with less basketball talent, explain that Dookies.</p> <br>
