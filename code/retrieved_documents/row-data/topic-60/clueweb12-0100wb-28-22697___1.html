 Wisconsin 
basketball (UW Athletics) <strong>By Benjamin Worgull</strong>  Publisher <br>

<b>Prior to the Penn 
State game, Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan passed out an article to his players about 
being better than average. It wasn't done to demand more out of No.21 
Wisconsin, but to simply serve as a needed reminder of what it takes to 
continue its success.</b> <br>
<br>
<b>MADISON - </b>Nobody would rightly accuse
Wisconsin basketball of being average when it comes to coach Bo Ryan and the 
Big Ten regular season.
<p> Since taking over the program in 2001, Wisconsin has finished in a tie for 
fourth place or better in the Big Ten each season, a run of success that has 
included three conference championships. That doesn&rsquo;t mean Ryan 
can&rsquo;t remind his players from time to time.</p>
<p> Stumbling on a Thomas Friedman article about being 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;better than average&rsquo; when it comes to education, Ryan 
handed the piece out to his players prior to thePenn State game 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; but he applied it in a different way.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Average is no longer good enough,&rdquo; Ryan said Monday. &ldquo;A 
lot of people could survive on average the past couple of generations. You 
can&rsquo;t survive on average now.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Wisconsin &acirc;&#128;&#147; which dropped two spots to No.21 in the 
Associated Press poll &acirc;&#128;&#147; continues to show it&rsquo;s better 
than the norm. Sitting in a tie for third place in the Big Ten, 1.5 games 
behind front runnerOhio State, Wisconsin (18-6, 7-4 Big Ten) has won six of 
seven heading into Thursday&rsquo;s tilt atMinnesota, which has won five of 
seven.</p>
<p> Ryan has always been big on pushing academics, especially with the sport 
he coaches playing in two semesters that typically involves plenty of midweek 
travel. According to the UW school of admissions, the typical unweighted, 
academic GPAs among incoming freshmen are between a 3.5 and a 3.9, a class rank 
in the 85&acirc;&#128;&#147;96 percentile and a typical score between 
27&acirc;&#128;&#147;29 on the ACT.</p>
<p> Far from average numbers, but the Badgers continue to push their academic 
envelope, having at least five Academic All-Big Ten selections for the last 
five seasons.</p>
<p> &ldquo;Being average in athletics, is that going to get you a 
scholarship?&rdquo; Ryan questioned. &ldquo;Is that going to give you a chance 
to pick what school you&rsquo;d like to go to? If you have better grades and 
you become a better player, you have more options to choose for your education.
</p>
<p> &ldquo;Parents, more and more that have children who are of high school 
age that are looking at colleges, when they come here and see us and they see 
the academic requirements to get in, parents always go, &acirc;&#128;&#152;I 
got into Wisconsin 25 years ago and I didn&rsquo;t have those kinds of 
grades.&rsquo; Average isn&rsquo;t good enough anymore if you want certain 
things in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Average won&rsquo;t cut it either against the Gophers. Despite seeing star 
forwardTrevor Mbakwe tear his right ACL seven games into the season, the 
Gophers have gotten replacement production in the form of junior guardRodney 
Williams, who Wisconsin recruited out of Robbinsdale Cooper (MN). Williams 
leads the team in scoring with 10.5 points a game.</p>
<p> &quot;They've got some good players,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;They've got 
some guys who aren't trying to do too much ... defensively they can get after 
you because of how athletic they are, and they've got some depth worked into 
the lineup. It hasn't surprised any of us that they're doing well, especially 
in a league you just don&rsquo;t know.&quot;</p>
<p> <b>Disparity home vs. road </b></p>
<p> Another notch in the &acirc;&#128;&#152;just don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; 
category in the Badgers shooting disparity between the road and the Kohl 
Center, especially behind the arc.</p>
<p> In 15 home games, Wisconsin is shooting 43.5 percent from the floor and 
32.9 percent from three-point range, numbers that have caused the Badgers to 
lose four home games in a season for the first time under Ryan.</p>
<p> In seven true road games, the Badgers are shooting 42.0 percent from the 
floor but 40.0 percent from three-point range, a reason why UW is 7-2 on the 
road and 5-2 in true road games.</p>
<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy and if there was an answer that was easily 
obtainable, I think we would have had it by now, as slow as I am,&rdquo; said 
Ryan. &ldquo;Junior high, high school, Division III, UWM, here, I&rsquo;ve 
never had a team get into those kinds of phases. You just keep working on your 
shooting drills in practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p> <b>The Barn </b></p>
<p> With 18 games in the Big Ten and the Big Ten Tournament, Ryan 
doesn&rsquo;t compare one game in the basketball season to a conference 
football game, meaning he doesn&rsquo;t hype Wisconsin&rsquo;s border battle 
any more or less than its matchup with Ohio State on Saturday.</p>
<p> Even so, Ryan appreciates playing in a venue like Minnesota&rsquo;s 
Williams Arena, which opened in 1928, because it reminds him of the Palestra, 
which opened in 1927, where he grew up going to games.</p>
<p> &ldquo;(The fans) can all tell you, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Well, I remember 
Kevin McHale&rsquo; or &acirc;&#128;&#152;Well, I remember Lou 
Hudson,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;It has memories for everybody. For fans 
up there, (the building) has been spruced up but the floor hasn&rsquo;t 
changed. It just something you have to be aware of. College atmosphere is 
pretty good, pretty exciting.&rdquo;</p>
