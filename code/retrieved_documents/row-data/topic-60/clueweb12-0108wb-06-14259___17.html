<p>The sheer size of Neyland Stadium tells you this is a football town. The 
scoreboards tell you something else.</p> 
<p>If you want to tailgate, get festive or watch the Vols run through the 
&quot;T,&quot; go to Neyland Stadium. If you want to see Tennessee win a 
meaningful game, go to Thompson-Boling Arena.</p> 
<p>UT fans were reminded again Saturday that they can count on basketball 
&mdash; even when they think they can't. And I'm not just talking about the 
women.</p> 
<p>The UT men are rebuilding under a new coach. Their last outing was a 
lopsided loss to Memphis. They were muddling along at 7-7 when the 13th-ranked 
Florida Gators came knocking on their door Saturday morning.</p> 
<p>But when the Gators knocked, the Vols rocked.</p> 
<p>UT's 67-56 victory will resonate beyond basketball. It took new coach 
Cuonzo Martin one SEC game to register a bigger victory than two different 
Tennessee football coaches have managed in the last three seasons.</p> 
<p>Sure, it's apples and big oranges. The degree of difficulty in achieving a 
major upset in basketball isn't close to pulling off one in football. But don't 
bother UT fans with such trivial matters. All they know is they attended a 
sporting event on the UT campus and didn't return home with their stomachs 
churning.</p> 
<p>Martin probably didn't notice or care, but his Ten</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>nessee fan club was growing by the basket Saturday. He was too busy plying 
his trade at court-side. In fact, he was still barking commands in the last two 
minutes, although the victory had been tucked away.</p> 
<p>His presence contrasted sharply with that of Florida coach Billy Donovan, 
who sat through the last five minutes as lifeless as a weary 
commercial-airlines traveler waiting on an overdue jet. To his credit, Donovan 
didn't attribute the outcome solely to his team's inadequate play. He said more 
than once in his postgame analysis that when you don't execute, the opponent 
often has a big hand in it.</p> 
<p>&quot;You have to give the other team credit when you don't necessarily do 
the things that you want to do,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Florida forward Erik Murphy dismissed another possible excuse by saying 
UT's early-season struggles didn't burden the Gators with overconfidence.</p> 
<p>&quot;We play Tennessee every year,&quot; he said. &quot;We know how good 
they are. I think they're better than their record shows. They played well 
today and deserved to win.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Vols were all over the Gators before the end of the first half, leading 
by four before pulling away in the last 20 minutes. They shot better, defended 
harder and seemed vastly more interested in the outcome. Their superiority was 
so apparent in upping the lead to 16 points, I wondered if Martin would be 
accused of running up the score.</p> 
<p>The Vols didn't just beat the Gators. They hurt them. Florida's Casey 
Prather actually fell to the floor and injured his ankle as UT's Cam Tatum 
changed directions on the dribble.</p> 
<p>The Gators sometimes looked as helpless in the second half as UT's football 
team once did trying to defend Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin, reminding you that 
Tennessee's basketball rivalry with Florida has become the antithesis of the 
Vols vs. Gators in football.</p> 
<p>In football, the Vols have lost seven consecutive games to Florida. In 
basketball, they have won 12 of the last 19 meetings.</p>

<p>The UT basketball program doesn't just prop up its football buddies against 
Florida. It also takes the heat off them during the bowl season.</p> 
<p>In 2005, when a UT team picked to contend for a national title was trying 
to figure out how it finished 5-6, Bruce Pearl's first UT basketball team beat 
sixth-ranked Texas by 17 points in Austin. In the 2009-10 season, less than a 
couple of weeks after the Vols were waylaid by Virginia Tech in the Chick-fil-A 
Bowl, their basketball team upset No. 1 Kansas.</p> 
<p>Now, as the Vols sit out another bowl season, the basketball team has 
managed to do two things in one day that the football program can't: beat a 
nationally ranked team and beat Florida.</p> 
<p>The Vols will have a couple of chances to enhance their reputation for 
upsets in the next week. They will play at Mississippi State on Thursday before 
taking on Kentucky at Thompson-Boling two days later.</p> 
<p>Maybe UT's football team will have a new defensive coordinator by then.</p>

<p>Accurate article, this has been going on for years, where it's taken 
basketball for us to have something to REALLY cheer about. This win was was

<p>Would fans prefer both teams sucked? I doubt it, and I'm sure Dooley is 
happy for Coach Martin. A good basketball program is good for the football 
team, just as a good football team is good for the basketball program. Dooley 
needs to be able to take recruits to TBA and have the same atmosphere as when 
Martin takes basketball recruits to Neyland.</p> <br>

<p>This is a good article and a good take on what's happening with UT 
athletics. As for you--vut5686#1405392--you're just a bitter little s---t who 
needs to get a life. Keep up the good work John. I don't know what hole these 
creeps have crawled out from, but I wish they'd get the hell off this site so 
grown up fans can stay tuned to UT sports.<br>
Pointless non-writing?!? 
Really!? Go to bed you little s---t so you can get up in the morning and 
deliver the paper!</p> <br>

<p>I'm absolutely thrilled for Martin and this team to get this great win over 
a very good Florida team. But why use this to further beat up the football 
program? What is to be gained in that? Does JA think this is just good insight 
and that fans will appreciate his sterling analysis??? You aren't surprised at 
his tone and message, but like so many others I'm quite sick of it. Dooley will 
be here next year. We WILL have a better season next year. And football, like 
basketball just a handful of years back, will turn around. Heaping garbage on 
them is totally unhelpful.....but then JA has NEVER been accused of trying to 
&quot;help.&quot; Congratulations and thanks VOLS!!! A great effort and showing!

<p>Dude, you and Adams need to look at the calendar. Football season is over 
and now we are in the basketball mode. You need to let it go, brother. That is 
you and Adams. You two together are not going to change the way things are and 
you sure as heck will not change the coaching staff at Tennessee. This was a 
great win. For Tennessee.</p> <br>

<p>The few Dool-Aid drinkers left are struggling to find a position to defend, 
and want to have it both ways hoping something will just magically happen.</p> 
<p>The knowledgeable Vol fans recognize that Martin inherited a total mess, 
with NCAA sanctions, yet in his first year takes a much less talented bunch and 
gets his signature win over a ranked Florida team! In fair comparison, Dooley 
has lost to the two worst Florida football teams in the past three decades.</p> 
<p>The entire nation still laughs at Dooley's loss to the worst Kentucky team 
in decades, and that was before Kentucky had to play a 4th string wide receiver 
as quarterback - but STILL upset a double-digit favored Tennessee!</p> <br>

<p>&quot;The basketball program this year isn't in as bad of shape as the 
football program was when Derek Dooley took over.&quot;</p> 
<p>The current pathetic state of UT football is due to Derek Dooley's lack of 
leadership. He's had two years to make his mark on this program and it's worse 
than it was when he took it over.</p> 
<p>It's funny though, because I bet that if he amazingly succeeds next season, 
it will be because he's such a wonderful coach...but if he fails, well...then 
it will be because the program was in such a horrible state when he took it 
over.</p> 
<p>You can't have it both ways.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Frankly Dwayne, I think most fans are simply looking for progress. This 
year could hardly be viewed as that, but perhaps the injuries to Hunter and 
Bray have given Dooley a bit of an out in that regard. Kentucky, on the other 
hand raised real concerns. The only place I might differ is what a good 2012 
season might suggest. If, as you say, he amazingly succeeds, how would that NOT 
be a result of good coaching and recruiting? As for failure....just how might 
you define that? If you are saying failure would be another losing season of 5 
or less wins, then I would agree with you, it's a bad statement on the 
coaching. But suppose he gets to just 7-6 with a bowl win? To my mind that 
would be progress and perhaps Dooley gets the benefit of the doubt. He DID 
inherit a bad situation, and I don't think a 3-5 year window to get us back to 
somewhere in the 9 win mark is too much to ask. For now, let's see who we get 
in here to fill the coaching vacancies and just where we end with this 
recruiting class. That will tell us a very great deal. And I think most would 
agree that the, &quot;we inherited a tough situation&quot; excuse is over in 
2012. I'm still cautiously optimistic we are going to look a LOT better next 
year. Whatever....I will be there rooting like h*ll for Dooley to succeed and 
my Vols to win!</p> <br>

<p>I could debate you on my already having &quot;gotten a good life,&quot;

<p>Here's the truth, geek: The basketball team played hard and got a good win. 
That has nothing to do with football, Pat Summitt's medical condition, the Swim 
Coach's situation, or Todd Raleigh's record at baseball. But Tuscaloosa John 
decides to take a 'feel good' win and put a sour spin on it.</p> 
<p>Are you that stupid, or are you a lap puppy for Adams?</p> <br>

<p>I wish I could think of something nasty to post about how sorry John Adams 
is. By the way, is he anywhere near retirement?</p> 
<p>The other KNS guys are pretty good. I think Erin Chapin is at the top of 
her game. John aaaaaaaalways tries to shade the light beaming on the 
Volunteers. I often wonder if he receives a check from LSU. Does anybody know?

<p>And if Dooley doesn't hire a couple of Defensive Coaches soon this 
recruiting season will be a lost cause. I don't know why he is waiting, but the 
damage being done daily is growing and I don't blame the kids. I wouldn't come 
to a School where I didn't know who my position coach or coordinator was 
either. I guess we can continue to lose recruits to South Carolina, like Diggs, 
because we are waiting for some reason that no one knows including the head 
coach I believe.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As long as the new guys are on board a couple of weeks before NSD--and if 
anybody has heard of them nationally, of course--I'm not too worried about the 
effect the void is having on recruits right now. If the new guys are who we 
need them to be, many if not all of the decommits will come back.</p> <br>

<p>The knowledgeable Vol fans recognize that Martin inherited a total mess,

gets his signature win over a ranked Florida team! In fair comparison, Dooley 
has lost to the two worst Florida football teams in the past three decades.</p>

</blockquote> 
<p>I think most everybody knows Dooley is just about out of excuses if he 
doesn't get it done next year, whatever &quot;get it done&quot; means in the 
context of recent UT football. The only valid excuse he will have is if he 
loses 15-20 guys to injuries in the preseason. Lots of us like some things, if 
not all things, about Dooley's personality and demeanor, and no reasonable 
person can fault his progress in rebuilding the program's overall numbers and 
depth if he can get most of this year's pretty good class nailed down. Nobody 
will CONTINUE to give Dooley the benefit of the doubt, whatever they may think 
about him personally, unless he has more on-field success next year. Some 
people with long memories and a tendency toward bitterness and negativity will 
hold that UK loss against him even if he wins the SEC East next year, but most 
fans won't. I was and am willing to give Dooley a reasonable chance and I think 
next year will be enough time to make a valid judgment about him.</p> <br>
