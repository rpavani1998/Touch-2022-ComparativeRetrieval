<p>I was out for a few days this week, and realized it's been a while since 
I&nbsp;offered up a blog. So without further adieu...</p> 
<p>-I think the fact that WKU didn't get invited to a bowl game is a real 
<strong>shame</strong>. Arguably one of the hottest teams in the country, one 
of the best running backs and they finished second in their conference, yet no 
bid. Oh, and the third and fourth place finishers in their league did. Huh? 
That my friends, is a real conundrum. (Yea I&nbsp;just used the word conundrum.)
</p> 
<p>-Good move in my opinion by WKU locking coach Taggart up. He came in to a 
tough situation and in two short years seems to have turned the program around. 
He has had two top recruiting classes in the Sun Belt and the players all seem 
to have really bought into his message.<strong>No reason to think he can't lead 
the Hilltoppers to a number of conference championships.</strong></p> 
<p>-Coach Taggart is also the highest paid employee at the university, which 
now makes football king at Western.</p> 
<p>-After a rough start the WKU men's basketball team has looked good in their 
last two wins. No reason to think they won't be 6-6 going into the game against 
Louisville.</p> 
<p>-Chane Behanan vs. George Fant should be a very good match-up to watch, 
although right now it looks like Behanan is the better player.</p> 
<p>-The Lady Toppers are just struggling right now, and that's all you can 
really say.</p> 
<p>-I think the Wildcats will get a tougher game out of Indiana on 
Saturday&nbsp;than most people think. IU gave coach Tom Crean time to build the 
program after it was decimated by Kelvin Sampson and it looks like they have 
finally turned the corner. That being said, I'll still take UK by 8-10.</p> 
<p>- Not many thoughts on HS basketball, mainly because I haven't seen a lot 
of it yet. I'll be at some games tonight and look forward to seeing some of the 
teams compete.</p>
