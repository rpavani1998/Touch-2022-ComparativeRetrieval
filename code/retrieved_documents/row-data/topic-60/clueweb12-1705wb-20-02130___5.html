Points are scored by shooting the ball through the basket from above; 
the team with more points at the end of the game wins. The ball can be advanced 
on the court by bouncing it (<i>dribbling</i>) or passing it between teammates. 
Disruptive physical contact (<i>fouls</i>) is not permitted and there are 
restrictions on how the ball can be handled (<i>violations</i>). In sports such 
as football (soccer), basketball, bandy and water polo, dribbling refers to the 
maneuvering of a ball around a defender through short skillful taps or kicks 
with either the legs (football/soccer), hands (basketball), stick (bandy) or 
swimming strokes (water polo). ...  In sports, a foul is a violation of the

Through time, basketball has developed to involve common techniques of 
shooting, passing and dribbling, as well as players' positions, and offensive 
and defensive structures. While competitive basketball is carefully regulated, 
numerousvariations of basketball have developed for casual play. In some 
countries, basketball is also a popular spectator sport. Variations of 
basketball are games or activities based on or similar to the game of 
basketball, in which the player utilizes common basketball skills. ... </p> 
<p><br>
While competitive basketball is primarily an indoor sport, played on a 
basketball court, less regulated variations have become exceedingly popular as 
an outdoor sport among both inner city and rural groups. In basketball, the 
basketball court is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with 
baskets at either end. ... </p>

<h2> History </h2> <br>
 The first basketball court: Springfield College. 
<p>In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith,[1] a Canadian physical 
education student and instructor atYMCA Training School[2] (today, Springfield 
College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, sought a vigorous indoor game to 
keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the longNew 
England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly 
suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basicrules and nailed a peach 
basket onto a 10-foot (3.05&nbsp;m) elevated track. In contrast with modern 
basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be 
retrieved manually after each &quot;basket&quot; or point scored, this proved 
inefficient, however, so a hole was drilled into the bottom of the basket, 
allowing the balls to be poked out with a longdowel each time. A further change 
was soon made, so the ball merely passed through, paving the way for the game 
we know today. A soccer ball was used to shoot goals. Whenever a person got the 
ball in the basket, they would give their team a point. Whichever team got the 
most points won the game.[3] Image File history File links Firstbasketball. ...

Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in 
early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, 
which incorporated rules from a Canadian children's game called &quot;Duck on a 
Rock&quot;, as many had failed before it. Naismith called the new game 'Basket 
Ball'.[4] Duck on a Rock was a medieval children&rsquo;s game. ... </p>

The first official basketball game was played in the YMCA gymnasium on 
January 20, 1892 with nine players, on a court just half the size of a 
present-dayStreetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.

Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the 
United States, and it quickly spread through the USA and Canada. By 1895, it 
was well established at several women's high schools. While the YMCA was 
responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it 
discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from 
the YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and 
professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before World War I, the
Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the 
United States (forerunner of theNCAA) vied for control over the rules for the 
game. - The Amateur Athletic Union, widely known as the AAU, was formed in

Basketball was originally played with an association football ball. 
The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in 
the late 1950s thatTony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible 
to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in 
common use. Soccer redirects here. ...  Paul D. Tony Hinkle (born: December 19, 
1899 in Logansport, IN; died: September 22, 1992) was a basketball coach at

<p><br>
Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the 
&quot;bounce pass&quot; to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of 
ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the 
asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game 
around the 1950s as manufacturing improved the ball shape.</p>

Although there is no direct evidence as yet that the idea of 
basketball came from the ancientMesoamerican ballgame, knowledge of that game 
had been available for at least 50 years prior to Naismith's creation in the 
writings ofJohn Lloyd Stephens and Alexander von Humboldt. Stephen's works 
especially, which included drawings byFrederick Catherwood, were available at 
most educational institutions in the 19th century and also had wide popular 
circulation. Ballcourt at Monte Alban Ballcourt at Uaxactun The Mesoamerican

<h3> College basketball and early leagues</h3> 
<p>Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball. Naismith 
coached atUniversity of Kansas for six years before handing the reins to 
renowned coachPhog Allen. Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought 
basketball to theUniversity of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of 
Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at theUniversity of 
Kentucky. In 1892, University of California and Miss Head's School, played the 
first women's inter-institutional game. Berenson's freshmen played the 
sophomore class in the first women's collegiate basketball game atSmith College,
March 21, 1893. The same year, Mount Holyoke and Sophie Newcomb College 
(coached byClara Gregory Baer) women began playing basketball. By 1895, the 
game had spread to colleges across the country, includingWellesley, Vassar and 
Bryn Mawr. The first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896. Stanford
 women playedBerkeley, 9-on-9, ending in a 2-1 Stanford victory. In 1901, 
colleges, including theUniversity of Chicago, Columbia University, Dartmouth 
College, University of Minnesota, the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Utah
 andYale University began sponsoring men's games. By 1910, frequent injuries on 
the men's courts promptedPresident Roosevelt to suggest that college basketball 
form a governing body. And the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the 
United States (IAAUS) was created. Game between Illinois State Redbirds &amp;

Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's 
professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States 
and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to 
team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. 
And barnstorming squads such as theOriginal Celtics and two all African 
American teams, theNew York Renaissance Five (&quot;Rens&quot;) and (still in 
existenceas of 2006) the Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a 
year on their national tours.Women's basketball was more structured. In 1905, 
the National Women's Basketball Committee's<i>Executive Committee on Basket 
Ball Rules</i> was created by the American Physical Education Association. 
These rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials. The
International Women's Sports Federation (1924) included a women's basketball 
competition. 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments 
were held by 1925. And in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first
national women's basketball championship, complete with men's rules. The first 
women'sAAU All-America team was chosen in 1929. Women's industrial leagues 
sprang up throughout the nation, producing famous athletes likeBabe Didrikson 
of theGolden Cyclones and the All American Red Heads Team who competed against 
men's teams, using men's rules. By 1938, the women's national championship 
changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per team. 
The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of 
Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as theNational 
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 
1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, theNational Invitation 
Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national 
tournament would begin one year later. Professional basketball refers to a

when dozens of players from top teams were implicated inmatch fixing and point

<h3> U.S. high school basketball</h3> 
<p>Before widespread school district consolidation, most United States high 
schools were far smaller than their present day counterparts. During the first 
decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal 
interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. 
In the days before widespreadtelevision coverage of professional and college 
sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of 
America. For other uses, see High school (disambiguation). ... </p> 
<p><br>
Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a 
basketball team invarsity competition. Basketball's popularity remains high, 
both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire 
community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams 
where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after 
graduation. In the 2003&ndash;04 season, 1,002,797 boys and girls represented 
their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the
National Federation of State High School Associations. The states of Illinois, 
Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for their residents' devotion 
to high school basketball, commonly calledHoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the 
critically acclaimed film<i>Hoosiers</i> shows high school basketball's depth 
of meaning to these rural communities. In the United States and Canada, varsity 
sports teams are the principal athletic teams representing a college, 
university, or high school or other secondary school. ...  The National

Basketball was first included in the Olympic Games in 1936, although a 
demonstration tournament was held in 1904. This competition has usually been 
dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles, the 
first loss in a controversial final game inMunich in 1972 against the Soviet 
Union. In 1950 the firstFIBA World Championship for men was held in Argentina. 
Three years later, the firstFIBA World Championship for Women was held in Chile

theirDream Team. However, with developing programs elsewhere, other national 
teams started to beat the United States. A team made entirely of NBA players 
finished sixth in the 2002 World Championships inIndianapolis, behind Yugoslavia

The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the 
ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents 
from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called ashot. A 
successful shot is worth two points, orthree points if it is taken from beyond 
the three-point arc which is 6.25 meters (20 ft 6 in) from the basket in 
international games and 23 ft 9 in (7.24 m) in NBA games. Look up shot in

basket. ... </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3> Playing regulations</h3> 
<p>Games are played in four quarters of 10 (international) or 12 minutes 
(NBA). College games use two 20 minute halves while most high school games use 
eight minute quarters. Fifteen minutes are allowed for a half-time break, and 
two minutes are allowed at the other breaks. Overtime periods are five minutes 
long. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual 
playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, 
games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, 
typically about two hours. Overtime is an additional period of play specified 
under the rules of a sport in order to bring the game to a decision and avoid 
declaring the contest a tie or draw. ... </p> 
<p><br>
Five players from each team (out of a twelve player roster) may be on 
the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when 
play is stopped. Teams also have acoach, who oversees the development and 
strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, 
managers, statisticians, doctors and athletic trainers. In sports, a coach or 
manager is an individual involved in the direction and instruction of the 
on-field operations of an athletic team or of individual athletes. ... </p> 
<p><br>
For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a 
pair of shorts and ajersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the 
team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear high-top sneakers that 
provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names, players' names and, outside 
of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms. The high-top is a shoe 
that extends significantly over the wearers ankle. ... </p> 
<p><br>
A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach 
for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no 
longer than one minute unless, for televised games, a commercial break is 
needed.</p> 
<p><br>
The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee 
(&quot;crew chief&quot; in the NBA), one or two umpires (&quot;referees&quot; 
in the NBA) and the table officials. For both college and the NBA there are a 
total of three referees on the court. The table officials are responsible for 
keeping track of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and teamfouls, 
player substitutions, teampossession arrow, and the shot clock. In basketball, 
a personal foul is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact 
with an opponent. ...  A jump ball is the method used to begin play in

A regulation basketball court in international games is 28 by 15 
meters (approx. 92 by 49 ft) and in the NBA is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 m). Most 
courts are made of wood. A steel basket with net and backboard hang over each 
end of the court. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is 
exactly 10 feet (3.05 m) above the court and 4 feet (1.2 m) inside the 
baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and 
backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct 
height; a rim that is off by but a few inches can have an adverse effect on 
shooting. In basketball, the basketball court is the playing surface, 
consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. ... </p>

<h3> Violations</h3> 
<p>The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between 
players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).
</p> 
<p><br>
The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball 
before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball-handler may not 
move both feet without dribbling, known astraveling, nor may he dribble with 
both hands or catch the ball in between dribbles, a violation calleddouble 
dribbling. A player's hand cannot be under the ball while dribbling; doing so 
is known ascarrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in 
the front half of the court, may not return the ball to the backcourt. The ball 
may not be kicked nor struck with the fist. A violation of these rules results 
in loss of possession, or, if committed by the defense, a reset of theshot clock
. In basketball, traveling is a violation of the rules that occurs when a 
player holding the ball illegally moves one or both of his feet. ...  In the 
game of basketball, a double dribble is a violation in which a player dribbles

<p><br>
There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball 
past halfway (8 seconds in international and NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high 
school), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in the NBA; 35 seconds in NCAA), 
holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the 
restricted area (the lane, or &quot;key&quot;) (3 seconds). These rules are 
designed to promote more offense. Note: most high school games do not employ a 
shot clock. A FIBA-sanctioned basketball court, with the key located as the 
trapezoid nearest to the basket. ... </p> 
<p><br>
No player may interfere with the basket or ball on its downward flight 
to the basket, or while it is on the rim (or, in the NBA, while it is directly 
above the basket), a violation known as<i>goaltending.</i> If a defensive 
player goaltends, the attempted shot is considered to have been successful. If 
a teammate of the shooter goaltends, the basket is cancelled and play continues 
with the defensive team being given possession.</p>

<h3> Fouls</h3> 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main articles: Personal foul, Technical foul</i> </dd> </dl> <br>
 The 
referee signals that a foul has been committed. 
<p>An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is 
illegal and is called a foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive 
players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players 
who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one 
or morefree throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on 
whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, 
which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.5 m) from the basket. In basketball, 
a personal foul is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact 
with an opponent. ...  In basketball, a technical foul is an infraction of the

<p><br>
The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by 
considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls 
controversial calls. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and 
even between referees.</p> 
<p><br>
A player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, for instance, by 
arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with 
a more serious foul called atechnical foul. The penalty involves free throws 
(which unlike a personal foul, the other team can<i>choose</i> who they want to 
shoot the free throws) and varies between leagues. Repeated incidents can 
result indisqualification. Blatant fouls with excessive contact or that are not 
an attempt to play the ball are called unsportsmanlike fouls (or flagrant fouls 
in the NBA) and typically will result in ejection. In basketball, a technical 
foul is an infraction of the rules usually concerning unsportsmanlike 
non-contact behavior. ...  In sports, an ejection is a disqualifying action 
assessed to a player or coach by a game official (such as a referee or umpire), 
usually for unsportsmanlike conduct. ... </p> 
<p><br>
If a team surpasses a preset limit of team fouls in a given period 
(quarter or half) &ndash; four for NBA and international games &ndash; the 
opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent fouls for 
that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college game if a 
team surpasses 7 fouls in the half the opposing team is awarded a one-and-one 
free throw (make the first you have a chance at a second). If a team surpasses 
10 fouls in the half the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all 
subsequent fouls for the half. A player who commits five fouls, including 
technical fouls, in one game (six in some professional leagues, including the 
NBA) is not allowed to participate for the rest of the game, and is described 
as having &quot;fouled out&quot;.</p> 
<p><br>
After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, it is said to 
be &quot;in the penalty&quot;. On scoreboards, this is usually signified with 
an indicator light reading &quot;Bonus&quot; or &quot;Penalty&quot; with an 
illuminated directional arrow indicating that team is to receive free throws 
when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of 
fouls committed.)</p> 
<p><br>
The number of free throws awarded increases with the number of fouls 
committed. Initially, one shot is awarded, but after a certain number of 
additional fouls are committed the opposing team may receive (a) one shot with 
a chance for a second shot if the first shot is made, called shooting 
&quot;one-and-one&quot;, or (b) two shots. If a team misses the first shot (or 
&quot;front end&quot;) of a one-and-one situation, the opposing team may 
reclaim possession of the ball and continue play. If a team misses the first 
shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of 
the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and 
continuing play.</p> 
<p><br>
If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is 
unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value 
of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point 
shot, then, receives two shots. A player fouled while attempting a three-point 
shot, on the other hand, receives three shots.</p> 
<p><br>
If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is 
successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for 
one point. In combination with a regular shot, this is called a 
&quot;three-point play&quot; because of the basket made at the time of the foul 
(2 points) and the additional free throw (1 point). Four-point plays, while 
rare, can also occur.</p>

<h2> Common techniques and practices</h2> 
<p></p> 
<h3> Positions and structures</h3> <br>
 Basketball positions in the offensive 
zone 
<p>Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have 
evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's 
evolution, one guard, two forwards, and two centers or two guards, two 
forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions 
have evolved, namely: Image File history File links Basketball_positions. ...  
Image File history File links Basketball_positions. ...  The five tactical 
basketball positions normally employed by organized basketball teams are: point 
guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. ... </p> 
<ol> 
<li>point guard: usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's 
offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right 
player at the right time</li> 
<li>shooting guard: creates a high volume of shots on offense; guards the 
opponent's best perimeter player on defense</li> 
<li>small forward: often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to 
the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but 
sometimes plays more actively</li> 
<li>power forward: plays offensively often with his back to the basket; on 
defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing 
power forward (in man-to-man defense)</li> 
<li>center: uses size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on 
defense), or to rebound.</li> </ol> 
<p>The above descriptions are flexible. On some occasions, teams will choose 
to use a<i>three guard offense</i>, replacing one of the forwards or the center 
with a third guard. The most commonly interchanged positions are point guard 
and shooting guard, especially if both players have good leadership and ball 
handling skills. This article does not cite any references or sources. ...  The 
Shooting guard (SG), also known as the two or off guard,[1] is one of five 
traditional positions on a basketball team. ...  This article does not cite any 
references or sources. ...  Power forward is a position in the sport of 
basketball. ...  This article does not cite any references or sources. ... </p> 
<p><br>
There are two main defensive strategies: <i>zone defense</i> and <i>
man-to-man defense</i>. Zone defense involves players in defensive positions 
guarding whichever opponent is in their zone. In man-to-man defense, each 
defensive player guards a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from 
taking action. Zone defense is a type of defense used in sports which is the 
alternative to man-to-man defense; instead of each player guarding a 
corresponding player on the other team, each defensive player is given an area, 
or a zone, to cover. ...  Man to man defense is a type of defensive tactic used 
in basketball and Football (Soccer) in which each player is assigned to defend 
and follow the movements of a single player on offense. ... </p> 
<p><br>
Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and 
movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player 
without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a<i>cut</i>. A legal 
attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by 
standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a<i>
screen</i> or <i>pick</i>. The two plays are combined in the <i>pick and roll
</i>, in which a player sets a pick and then &quot;rolls&quot; away from the 
pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive 
plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful 
basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure 
their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually 
responsible for indicating which play will occur. The pick and roll (also 
called screen and roll or shortened to screen-roll) in basketball, is an 
offensive play in which a player sets a screen (pick) for a teammate handling 
the ball and then slips behind the defender (rolls) to accept a pass. ... </p> 
<p><br>
Defensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasized 
in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a 
time-out to discuss.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3> Shooting</h3> <br>
 Player releases a short jump shot, while her defender 
is either knocked down, or trying to &quot;take a charge.&quot; 
<p>Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball 
through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the 
most common technique can be outlined here. Image File history File links

Academy, Annapolis, Md. ... </p> 
<p><br>
The player should be positioned facing the basket with feet about 
shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and back straight. The player holds 
the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly 
above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. To aim the ball, 
the player's elbow should be aligned vertically, with the forearm facing in the 
direction of the basket. The ball is shot by bending and extending the knees 
and extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the 
finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. When the 
shooting arm is stationary for a moment after the ball released, it is known as 
a follow-through; it is incorporated to maintain accuracy. Generally, the 
non-shooting arm is used only to guide the shot, not to power it.</p> 
<p><br>
Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its 
impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but 
generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into 
the basket, but shooters may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the 
basket.</p> 
<p><br>
The two most common shots that use the above described set up are the 
<i>set shot</i> and the <i>jump shot</i>. The set shot is taken from a standing 
position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. 
The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This 
provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate 
over the defender. Failure to release the ball before returning the feet to the 
ground is a traveling violation. A jump shot being taken at the FIBA EuroCup 
Women Finals in 2005. ... </p> 
<p><br>
Another common shot is called the <i>layup</i>. This shot requires the 
player to be in motion toward the basket, and to &quot;lay&quot; the ball 
&quot;up&quot; and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the 
backboard-free, underhand version is called a<i>finger roll</i>). The most 
crowd-pleasing, and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the<i>slam 
dunk</i>, in which the player jumps very high, and throws the ball downward, 
straight through the hoop. Allen Iverson performing a high percentage layup. ...
 This article is about the term, slam dunk. For other uses, see Slam dunk 
(disambiguation). ... </p> 
<p><br>
Another shot that is becoming common is the &quot;circus shot&quot;. 
The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or 
flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, 
and/or facing away from the basket. Dwyane Wade is the current king of circus 
shots, following in the footsteps of former circus shooting legends like 
Michael Jordan and Dominque Wilkins.</p> 
<p><br>
A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is 
referred to as anair ball. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the 
backboard, is jocularly called abrick. In basketball, an air ball is any shot 
that misses the basket completely and does not hit either the net, rim, or 
backboard. ...  Brick (Basketball) is a slang term used in basketball to 
describe a shot that misses in a rather dramatic way. ... </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3> Rebounding</h3> 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main article: Rebound (basketball)</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p>The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the 
basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the 
hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end 
when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive 
rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not 
change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains 
possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the 
team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots. A 
rebound in basketball is the act of successfully gaining possession of the 
basketball after a missed field goal or free throw. ... </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3> Passing</h3> 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>See also: Assist (basketball)</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p>A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are 
accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with 
the hands to ensure accuracy. In basketball, an assist is attributed to a 
player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by 
field goal, meaning that he or she was assisting in the basket. ... </p> 
<p><br>
A staple pass is the <i>chest pass</i>. The ball is passed directly 
from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest. A proper chest pass involves 
an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defense little 
time to react.</p> 
<p><br>
Another type of pass is the <i>bounce pass</i>. Here, the passer 
bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the 
receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The 
bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder 
for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a 
violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to 
pass around a defender.</p> 
<p><br>
The <i>overhead pass</i> is used to pass the ball over a defender. The 
ball is released while over the passer's head.</p> 
<p><br>
The <i>outlet pass</i> occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. 
The next pass after the rebound is the<i>outlet pass</i>.</p> 
<p><br>
The crucial aspect of any good pass is being impossible to intercept. 
Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and touch and know exactly 
where each of their teammates like to receive the ball. A special way of doing 
this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is 
called a<i>no-look pass</i>.</p> 
<p><br>
Another advanced style of passing is the <i>behind-the-back pass</i> 
which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the 
passer's back to a teammate. Although some players can perform them 
effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, 
believing them to be fundamentally unsound, difficult to control, and more 
likely to result in turnovers or violations.</p>

<h3> Dribbling</h3> <br>

<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main article: Dribble</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously, and is a 
requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player 
pushes the ball down towards the ground rather than patting it; this ensures 
greater control. Download high resolution version (500x684, 93 KB)Caption:

universe, appearing in the computer game Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. Jerec is 
the leader of the seven Dark Jedi that the player must face in the game. ... 
</p> 
<p><br>
When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the 
hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive 
player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to 
dribble competently with both hands.</p> 
<p><br>
Good dribblers (or &quot;ball handlers&quot;) tend to bounce the ball 
low to the ground, reducing the travel from the floor to the hand, making it 
more difficult for the defender to &quot;steal&quot; the ball. Additionally, 
good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, 
and change hands and directions of the dribble frequently, making a less 
predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend, this is called 
a crossover which is the most effective way to pass defenders while dribbling.
</p> 
<p><br>
A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the 
dribbling motion orperipheral vision to keep track of the ball's location. By 
not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring 
opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of someone stealing the ball from 
him/her. Peripheral vision is a part of vision that occurs outside the very 
center of gaze. ... </p>

<h2> Height</h2> 
<p>At the professional level, most male players are above 1.90 meters (6 ft 3 
in) and most women above 1.70 meters (5 ft 7 in). Guards, for whom physical 
coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest 
players. Almost all forwards in the men's pro leagues are 2 meters (6 ft 6 in) 
or taller. Most centers are over 2.1 meters (6 ft 10 in) tall. According to a 
survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just 
under 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m), with the average weight being close to 222 lb (101 
kg). The tallest players ever in the NBA wereManute Bol and Gheorghe 
Mure&#351;an, who were both 2.31 m (7 ft 7 in) tall. The tallest current NBA 
player isYao Ming, who stands at 2.26 m (7 ft 6 in). Manute Bol (born October 
16, 1962) is a Sudanese-born basketball player and activist. ...  Gheorghe

Yao (&aring;&sect;&#154;) Yao Ming (Chinese: ; Pinyin: ) (born September 12, 
1980, in Shanghai, China) is a Chinese professional basketball player and is 
arguably the best center in the National Basketball Association (NBA) today. ...

<p><br>
The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is Muggsy Bogues at 1.60 
meters (5 ft 3 in). Other short players have thrived at the pro level.Anthony 
&quot;Spud&quot; Webb was just 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) tall, but had a 42-inch 
(1.07 m) vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping. The 
shortest player in the NBA today isEarl Boykins at 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m). 
While shorter players are often not very good at defending against shooting, 
their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal 
the ball by reaching low are strengths. Tyrone Curtis Bogues (born January 9, 
1965, in Baltimore, Maryland), better known as Muggsy Bogues, is a retired

<h2> Variations and similar games</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main article: Variations of basketball</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p><b>Variations of basketball</b> are activities based on the game of 
basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball 
and basket). Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others 
are distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other 
variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help 
players reinforce skills. Variations of basketball are games or activities 
based on or similar to the game of basketball, in which the player utilizes 
common basketball skills. ... </p> 
<p><br>
Wheelchair basketball is played on specially designed wheelchairs for 
the physically impaired. The world governing body of wheelchair basketball is 
the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation[5] (IWBF). Water basketball, 
played in a swimming pool, merges basketball and water polo rules. Beach 
basketball is played in a circular court with no backboard on the goal, no 
out-of-bounds rule with the ball movement to be done via passes or 2 1/2 steps, 
as dribbling is not allowed.[6] Wheelchair basketball is a sport played 
primarily by people with disabilities. ...  Water basketball is a water sport 
which mixes rules of basketball and water polo. ... </p> 
<p><br>
There are many variations as well played in informal settings without 
referees or strict rules. Perhaps the single most common variation is the<i>
half court</i> game. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be 
&quot;cleared&quot; - passed or dribbled outside the half-court or three-point 
line - each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other. 
Half-court games require lesscardiovascular stamina, since players need not run 
back and forth a full court. Half-court games also raise the number of players 
that can use a court, an important benefit when many players want to play. The 
circulatory system or cardiovascular system is the organ system which 
circulates blood around the body of most animals. ... </p> 
<p><br>
A popular version of the half-court game is 21. Two-point shots count 
as two points and shots from behind the three-point line count three. A player 
who makes a basket is awarded up to three extra free throws (or unlimited if 
you are playing &quot;all day&quot;), worth the usual one point. When a shot is 
missed, if one of the other players tips the ball in with two while it is in 
the air, the score of the player who missed the shot goes back to zero, or if 
they have surpassed 13, their score goes back to 13. This is called a 
&quot;tip&quot;. If a missed shot is &quot;tipped&quot; in, but the player who 
tips it in only uses one hand, then the player who shot it is out of the game 
and has to catch an air ball to get back in. The first player to reach exactly 
21 points wins. If they go over, their score goes back to 13. Jonathan</p> 
<p><br>
Other variations include streetball, knockout, and one-on-one; a 
variation in which two players will use only a small section of the court 
(often no more than a half of a court) and compete to play the ball into a 
single hoop. Such games tend to emphasize individual dribbling and ball 
stealing skills over shooting and team play. Streetballers at the Venice Beach 
basketball courts, California, USA. Streetball is an urban form of basketball, 
played on playgrounds and in gymnasiums across the world. ... </p>
