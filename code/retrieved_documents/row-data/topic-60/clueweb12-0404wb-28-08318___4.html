 While people from Oslo to Athens 
and from London to Vladivostok were avidly following the European football 
championship in June, Americans ignored it. In the United States, the only way 
to see the Greece-Portugal final, or any other match in the tournament, was to 
make a special, costly arrangement with a satellite broadcasting company or to 
find a pub that was showing one of the games. Any such pub would invariably be 
located in an obscure corner of a large city and filled with people speaking 
languages other than English.
<p>Euro 2004 was the latest episode in the long history of American 
indifference to the world's favourite sport, which continues despite strenuous 
efforts to put the game on the same footing as America's three major team 
games: baseball, American football and basketball. Why have these efforts 
failed?</p> 
<p>One reason has to do with the existing popularity of the big three. Even in 
as large and wealthy a country as the United States, where the national 
appetite for playing, and even more so for watching, games is enormous, the 
cultural, economic and psychological space available for sport is limited and 
that space is already taken. Baseball, American football and basketball have 
long since put down deep roots, claimed particular seasons of the year as their 
own (although they now overlap) and gained the allegiance of the 
sports-following public.</p> 
<p>A fourth team sport, ice hockey, is widely played across the northern tier 
of the country and has a professional league with teams located across the 
border in Canada and throughout the United States, even in cities whose 
climates are so benign that ice has never formed in them: indeed, the franchise 
in Tampa, Florida, won this year's championship. The presence of four major 
team sports - more than in any other country - has made the barrier to entry in 
the competition for the affections and the dollars of American sports fans 
extraordinarily high, so high that even the world's most popular game has not 
been able to surmount it.</p> 
<p>One in particular of those three sports - basketball - poses a singular 
obstacle to the national acceptance of football. The two are too similar for 
them both to succeed. Each belongs to the family of games whose object is to 
put a ball (or similar object) in a goal.</p> 
<p>Because the two games are similar, they have the same kind of appeal. Both 
are easy to follow; you can immediately understand the point of each one. The 
rules and strategies of cricket, baseball, rugby and American football, by 
contrast, are less straightforward. The action of a basketball game and of a 
football match are easier to follow than that of other team sports as well 
because the ball is larger than in cricket and baseball and is never hidden in 
a tangle of bodies or a scrum, as it is in American football and rugby.</p> 
<p>Football and basketball are also easier to play than the other team games. 
They do not require elaborate equipment and satisfactory informal games can be 
staged without the full complement of players. And both football and basketball 
players can perfect their skills practising entirely alone.</p> 
<p>Spectators see the same thing in the two games: episodes of spontaneous 
coordination, with players devising and implementing schemes for scoring. They 
see, that is, acts of creation. If architecture is, as is sometimes said, music 
set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity 
embodied in team sports.</p> 
<p>The two games are both played partly in the air. Basketball players spring 
off the floor to launch shots at the basket and soar to capture missed shots as 
they bounce off the rim, even as football players leap upward to intercept a 
kicked ball with their heads to control it, tap it to a team-mate, or redirect 
it into their opponents' goal. Football and basketball are therefore the team 
sports that most vividly evoke a common human fantasy: to leave the ground and 
fly through the air.</p> 
<p>This is why, perhaps, football and basketball are the team sports with the 
widest global appeal. It is no surprise that each of the two has established a 
beachhead in the last great expanse of unoccupied sports territory, the 
People's Republic of China. Their marked similarities, however, also mean that 
the two sports duplicate each other. They provide the same satisfactions. For 
spectators they are, in a sense, alternatives. North Americans don't need 
football because they already get what it has to offer from basketball.</p> 
<p>There is, too, the problem of the frequency with which football matches end 
in a draw. Americans want conclusive results from their games. Baseball and 
basketball have rules forbidding draws: the two teams must play until one of 
them wins. Draws were more common in American football until two decades ago 
when, responding to the national irritation with them, the managers of the 
sport changed the rules. Now collegiate games cannot end in draws and 
professional contests very rarely do.</p> 
<p>Most American sports fans would regard the method used for deciding 
international championship matches that end in a draw even after extra time - 
the penalty shoot-out - as absurdly arbitrary and no more fitting a way to 
determine a winner than flipping a coin.</p> 
<p>There is a remedy for what is, in American eyes, football's gravest defect. 
The game's rules could be changed to make scoring much easier, which would mean 
that even if the match were drawn at the end of 90 minutes, one or the other 
team would almost certainly score in extra time.</p> 
<p>Altering the rules to encourage scoring is an old and well established 
practice in American sport. In the course of the 20th century, baseball, 
American football and basketball each did so several times. The changes helped 
to sustain, and indeed to expand, the popularity of all three, since, as one 
astute student of baseball put it, 'offense [scoring] is making things happen. 
Defense is keeping things from happening. People would much rather watch things 
happen.'</p> 
<p>To do the same thing for football might well require dramatic modifications 
in the way the game is now played - the abolition of the offside rule, for 
example, or awarding points that count in the final score for corner kicks, 
which, as in prize fights that do not end in knockouts, would give an advantage 
to the side that makes the most determined efforts to score.</p> 
<p>Why has this not happened in the US? One possible reason is that such 
changes would make the American version of football substantially different 
from the game played everywhere else, and here Americans are reluctant to be 
out of step with the rest of the world. If that is the case, then the failure 
of the world's most popular sport to gain full acceptance in the world's most 
sports-obsessed country suggests that there are, after all, limits to American 
unilateralism.</p>
