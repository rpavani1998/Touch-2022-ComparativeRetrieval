<p>Officials from what&rsquo;s left of the Big East&rsquo;s dwindling football 
membership had another conference call on Tuesday morning and there remains no 
specific timetable on adding UCF, but &ldquo;appears an invitation is 
forthcoming&rdquo; for the Knights, the league&rsquo;s No. 1 target.</p> 
<p>The presidents, chancellors and athletic directors continued to discuss 
potential expansion candidates. Among those mentioned were UCF, Air Force, 
Navy, Temple, Houston, SMU and Boise State, a league source told CBSSports.com.
</p> 
<p>While Commissioner John Marinatto said in a statement Monday the league 
would consider a model with 12 football members, part of Tuesday&rsquo;s call 
was discussing the possibility of splitting the football and basketball 
conference into divisions, once the football side is replenished.</p> 
<p>Navy, Air Force and Boise State are being considered as football members 
only, while UCF, Temple, Houston and SMU are at the top of the list as 
all-sports members so it&rsquo;s unknown right now how large the basketball 
membership could grow.</p> 
<p>The Newark Star-Ledger reported one proposed alignment discussed at 
Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting consisted of Rutgers, UConn, South Florida, UCF, Temple 
and Navy in an East Division with West Virginia, Louisville, Cincinnati, Air 
Force, SMU and Houston in a West Division.</p> 
<p>However, there remains the very real possibility Louisville and West 
Virginia may not be in the league and bound for the Big 12 if Missouri leaves 
for the SEC or the Big 12 expands to 12 teams.</p> 
<p>What make Temple, SMU and Houston attractive to the Big East, one source 
said, is their respective television markets. Philadelphia (Temple) is the 
nation&rsquo;s No. 4 market, Dallas (SMU) is No. 5 and Houston is No. 10.</p> 
<p>Beyond Navy, Air Force and UCF, a league source said &ldquo;no one team is 
definitely next&rdquo; as an expansion candidate.</p> 
<p>There also appears to be conflicting opinions on pursuing Boise State. Some 
league members support adding Boise State because of the Broncos&rsquo; recent 
success, which would help the league with its future BCS status. However, 
others believe Boise State, located nearly 700 miles west of Air Force and 
nearly 2,200 miles from Tampa/USF, is simply too far to consider.</p> 
<p>Boise State president Bob Kustra said in a statement Monday that the 
Broncos &ldquo;are looking forward to their inaugural season&rdquo; in the 
Mountain West Conference and he &ldquo;has great confidence in the future 
direction of the Mountain West.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with 
other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus 
is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped 
make Boise State a popular and compelling national brand,&quot; Kustra said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we 
are continuing to monitor the situation.&nbsp;We are confident that Boise State 
will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status 
with the best interests of the entire university in mind.&nbsp;Boise 
State&rsquo;s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, 
popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely 
valuable conference partner.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A league source also told CBSSports.com that Army is no longer being 
considered as a candidate by the Big East. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been honest 
with us and that they&rsquo;re not interested because of the challenges they 
had previously in Conference USA,&rdquo; the source said.</p> 
<p>Army was in C-USA from 1998-2004. The Cadets were 9-41 in C-USA play and 
finished last in the league five of the seven seasons.</p>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Just add all three 
service academies as football-only, along with Temple, UCF, and Houston or 
Memphis. &nbsp;If they add upwards of 4 or 5 pathetic basketball programs the 
non-football schools needs to get some sense and bolt, add Xavier, Dayton, and 
Butler and have their own conference that isn't diluted with poor programs. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2> 
<p>Does the Big East seriously think that they will retain their automatic BCS 
bid?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Isn't it time to acknowledge the obvious and drop 
football, allow the remaining 6 football programs to seek membership in viable 
football conferences?&nbsp; The Big East is a wonderful basketball conference, 
and they should focus on maximizing what they do best.</p> <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Even if you somehow form 
a football conference, you'll lose your AQ BCS bids and in turn, 
your&nbsp;leftover football schools will bolt leaving you in&nbsp;limbo.&nbsp; 
The Big East is about to be on the same level as the MAC.&nbsp; UConn, WVU, and 
Louisville will leave all in good time.&nbsp; <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  BYU has higher average 
attendance last season than all of those teams, I watched the ECU UCF Game on 
tv and there was an announced attendance of 40,073 but it looked like the fans 
had an aluminum out. Even the UCF announcer calling the game for CSS said 
&quot;There are a few empty seats for today's game because of Florida 
Georgia&quot; Big East wants a fan base that will not show up for a major 
divisional game because two other teams not related to the university is 
playing an annual neutral site game. I am biased like everyone else in this 
idiotic argument of college football realignment. Reason, logic, common sense 
and good thinking do not belong. a full 50,000 seat stadium or 49,000 in a 
50,000 is much better than having most of your &quot;fans&quot; at another . 
game. I Would be afraid to be in UCF's stadium if it was expanded to 56,000. it 
already shakes due to cheap aluminum construction. But you don't have to worry 
you have the nod according to lots of people as the best fit for the BE and 
enjoy it, UCF did not earn it and the tv's will be watching other games.<br>

<br>I don't believe the academy are any good, they might bring in the all 
mighty tv but they can't recruit because of their requirements. The triple 
option will be figured out once they play league play a time or two. SMU and 
Houston are flashes in the pan and don't make noise but once every ten years. 
They are in texas so they cant complete against UT, TAMU, OK, Dallas Cowboys 
and Houston Texas. Nova stinks, they play in a cracker jack box of Division II 
mediocrity. Temple is the same thing only they play in Eagles stadium but the 
Eagles will have a tough time filling it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ECU and UCF are the 
most qualified to go and one does not have Disney world in their 
backyard.&nbsp; But am just like this guy blogging and speaking of information 
i believe to know as facts but not 100 percent. The fact of the matter is, once 
the announcement comes out. Because UCF going to the Big East has been 
supposedly been announced each week for the last year. I will wait to see an 
official Big East announcement.<br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Can someone please 
explain why East Carolina is on the outside looking in? &nbsp;Top 3 attendance 
outside the AQ schools. &nbsp;Big untapped TV market of Raleigh, TideWater and 
Charlotte. Strong facilities and a strong out of conference schedule year in 
year out. &nbsp;SMU and UCF are riding a high and at the moment ECU is in flux. 
&nbsp;This stinks just like 03-04 expansion. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm a Pirate 
fan but ECU as a better overall sports program for the Big East. &nbsp;Champion 
Baseball and olympic sports. &nbsp;This is appauling. &nbsp;Hitching on to 
Service Academies and &nbsp;former schools is terrible. <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Real_Zeel, perhaps you 
should look at your TV schedule more closely as every UH game this year has/is 
on TV.&nbsp; Additionally we are averaging 31,000 (32,000 capacity) per 
game.&nbsp; Last year UH sold out every home game.&nbsp; UH is also close to 
breaking ground on a new 40,000 (expandable to 50,000) seat stadium.&nbsp;<br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2> 
<p>This so called &quot;Source&quot; that everyone writing articles keeps 
mentioning seems to not be in the same meetings.&nbsp; Why don't you people 
quit making up news so people will read your crap.&nbsp; You don't have ANY 
idea&nbsp;which teams are being looked at then the next guy.&nbsp; So idiot 
in&nbsp;Orlando lies and says the Big East called and it's on the front page of 
every newspaper from New York to Japan.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Big East is the 
worst AQ conference in the country because they do stupid stuff like wanting 
Temple who they kicked out for sucking and now looking at UCF who this season 
is the 7th best team in Florida, can't draw a sell out crowd of 40,000 people 
when they give away tickets and have the worst fanbase in the state of 
Florida.&nbsp; IF the BE wants to survive they better add some football teams 
that will win games and draw ratings.&nbsp; TV Markets are the most stupid 
thing in the world when NCAA football is a global sport that has no markets, 
only fans and people that watch teams.&nbsp; If you can't fill up your home 
stadium there sure as heck isn't any demand to see you on TV.</p> <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Actually UCF's stadium 
capacity is about 45,000, not 35,000. With potential to expand to 56,000. Their 
average attendance for last season was just under 40,000. That's not great. But 
when you consider UCF plays a home schedule with teams like Rice, Tulane and 
Memphis, its not that bad either. And last season Florida and Georgia played on 
10/30 in Jacksonville. That same day UCF hosted ECU and drew 40,073.<br>
<br>

Why don't you check your facts before you criticize his reporting.&nbsp;<br>

<br>Only 3 non-AQ schools had a higher average attendance last season (TCU, ECU 
and Air Force).<br>
<br>
If UCF is such a bad choice then who do you propose 
would be a better choice out of the pool of non-AQ teams available? &nbsp; <br>

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Wow, I can't wait for 
those riveting UCF-Temple and Rutgers-Navy divisional matchups.&nbsp; Other 
than the potential USF-UCF rivalry, I can't see any other matchup drawing much 
interest at all.<br>
<br>
The West division looks halfway decent, but the East 
is just godawful. **** you Pitt and Syracuse for ruining this conference.&nbsp;

<h2>Big East plotting football, hoops divisions</h2>  Sad part is East 
Carolina gets a decent share of football Tv's from Eastern North Carolina, 
Tidewater Va, Charlotte, and Raleigh metro areas but when they bring up TV they 
never mention that. That is a little site that explains the East Carolina 
Market. http://www.ecu.edu/undaunted/<br>
<br>
Big East only knows market 
because they are mainly in the North East, They do not understand that there 
are areas outside markets that enjoy college football. That support and follow 
their team to away games. Also everyone fails to mention there is not a single 
team in the SEC with a large market. SEC has the highest TV ratings, largest 
attendance numbers and most championships. Why is that? Mostly because until 
recent memory the south has not had NFL competition and College was the only 
game in town. I would bet everyone in the SEC minus Vandy outdraws the Falcons 
even when they have a good year. SEC never used market in their argument for 
expansion, they used what team would bring in fans, money and attention. While 
i think TAMU will not do any better in the SEC they bring a new fan base and 
tv's from texas that watch the games not a city that no one watches.<br>
