<h1>Chiropractic Research on Back Pain</h1> 
<h3>Chiropractic research on back pain can be found in various scientific 
studies that have been published from January 1994 through June 2003. The 
descriptions and findings of these research studies are based on randomized 
clinical trials and primarily focused on people with low back pain. Other 
chiropractic research on back pain focused just on adults with the condition.

<h2>Chiropractic Research on Back Pain: A Summary</h2>  The following table 
describes descriptions and findings for various &nbsp; chiropractic research 
studies onback pain. <br>
 &nbsp; <strong>  Published from January 1994 through 
June 2003 </strong> <strong>Citation</strong> <strong>Description</strong> 
<strong>Findings</strong> <br>
 Hurwitz et al., 2002  Randomized clinical trial 
(RCT) of patients in a managed care organization compared chiropractic care 
(with and without any of the following added: heat or cold therapy, ultrasound, 
electrical muscle stimulation) with conventional medical care (with and without 
physical therapy added). Participants (652) had<strong>acute</strong> <strong>, 
</strong> <strong>subacute</strong> <strong>, </strong>or <strong>chronic 
</strong> <strong>low back pain </strong>with or without leg pain. Back pain 
intensity and back-related disability were measured.  After six months of 
follow-up, the conventional medical care and chiropractic regimens were found 
to be comparably effective.<br>
<br>
 Hsieh et al., 2002  RCT compared four 
treatments for<strong>subacute low back pain</strong> (LBP): &quot;joint 
manipulation&quot; by a chiropractor, back school (program of counseling and 
exercises), myofascial therapy, and joint manipulation plus myofascial therapy. 
Participants (178) had LBP for either longer than three weeks but less than six 
months in a current episode or more than two months within the preceding eight 
months for recurrent LBP, and were evaluated three weeks and six months after 
treatment.  No statistically significant differences were found between groups 
at three weeks or six months.<br>
<br>
 Cherkin et al., 1998  RCT in an HMO 
setting of 321 adults aged 20 to 64 with<strong>low back pain</strong>. 
Patients received chiropractic manipulation, physical therapy (PT), or a 
booklet on self-managing back pain. They were monitored for two years and 
evaluated for bothersome symptoms and level of dysfunction.  The outcomes for 
those who received manipulation or PT were better than those who received the 
booklet, but &quot;only marginally better.&quot; There were no significant 
differences between the manipulation and PT groups. Authors note that 
manipulation and PT &quot;may slightly reduce symptoms.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Bronfort et al., 1996  For <strong>chronic low back pain</strong>, prospective 
RCT compared: (1) chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) plus 
trunk-strengthening exercises with (2) chiropractic SMT plus trunk-stretching 
exercises and (3) trunk-strengthening exercises combined with anNSAID (drug). 
Enrollees (174) were measured for low back pain, disability, and functional 
health status at 5 and 11 weeks.<br>
 Each of the three regimens yielded a 
&quot;similar and clinically important improvement over time that was 
considered superior to the expected natural history of long-standing chronic 
low back pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Carey et al., 1995  Prospective observational 
study on the outcomes of care for<strong>acute low back pain</strong> by 
chiropractors, primary care practitioners, and orthopedic surgeons, including 
how long it took to return to functional status. Participants (1,633) had acute 
pain of less than 10 weeks' duration.  Time to recovery was &quot;essentially 
the same,&quot; regardless of who provided the care.<br>
<br>
 Meade et al., 
1995  RCT of 741 patients who came to chiropractic and hospital outpatient 
clinics in 11 centers for<strong>low back pain</strong>. Participants were 
randomized to receive either chiropractic or hospital-outpatient management. 
Outcomes were measured mainly with a pain disability questionnaire, at six 
weeks, six months, and one, two, and three years.  Chiropractic was found to be 
more effective, especially for those with &quot;short current episodes, a 
history of back pain, and initially high [pain scale] scores.&quot; Benefit was 
less evident at two and three years than earlier. Authors noted that further 
trials are needed, for example, on specific components of chiropractic care.<br>
<br>  Triano et al., 1995  RCT comparing chiropractic spinal manipulation, sham 
manipulation, and a back-education program. Participants (170) had<strong>low 
back pain</strong> (lasting seven weeks or longer or consisting of at least six 
episodes in 12 months) and were evaluated for pain and activity tolerance at 
enrollment, after two weeks of treatment, and after two weeks of no treatment.  
Greater improvement was found in the manipulation group than in other groups. 
Pain relief continued to end after the evaluation period.<br>
<br>
 Pope et 
al., 1994  Prospective RCT compared chiropractic spinal manipulation for 
treatment of<strong>subacute low back pain</strong> to massage, use of a 
corset, and TMS (electrical muscle stimulation). Patients (164) were treated 
for three weeks and evaluated through various standardized instruments and 
examinations.  Various improvements were seen in all four groups. The 
manipulation group had the most improvement in flexion and pain. However, 
authors concluded overall that none of the changes in physical outcomes 
measured was significantly different between groups.<br>
