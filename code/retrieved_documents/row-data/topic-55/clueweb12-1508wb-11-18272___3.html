<h1>What is Chiropractic?</h1> 
<p>The practice and procedures which may be employed by Chiropractic 
Physicians are based on postgraduate academic and clinical training received in 
and through accredited chiropractic colleges and include, but are not limited 
to, the use of current diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Such procedures 
specially include the adjustment and manipulation of the articulations and 
adjacent tissues of the human body, particularly of the spinal column. Included 
is the treatment of intersegmental aberrations for alleviation of related 
functional disorders. In essence, chiropractors help your body to function as 
it did when you were younger.</p> 
<p>The attempt is made to restore normal neuromusculoskeletal function as much 
as possible. Clearly, the sooner intervention occurs, the greater the success 
of chiropractic treatment. Frequently, spinal problems start in childhood, 
years before clinical symptoms appear. Identified early, most of these 
disorders are reversible, and it is for this reason that spinal examinations 
for children are imperative.</p> 
<p>Chiropractic is a drug-free, non-surgical science and, as such, does not 
include pharmaceuticals or incisive surgery. Chiropractic Physicians may 
utilize physiotherapy modalities to enhance the body's ability to repair and 
heal.</p> 
<p>Chiropractic adjustments are safer than aspirin, muscle relaxers, and back 
surgery. Dozens of research studies have documented the safety and 
effectiveness of chiropractic adjustments. When compared with traditional 
approaches, chiropractic care is remarkably safe. In fact, millions of 
chiropractic adjustments are safely delivered to satisfied patients every day!
</p> 
<p>Chiropractic works. In a nationwide Gallop Study, nine of ten chiropractic 
patients felt their treatment was effective. Studies and surveys indicate that 
chiropractic patients are well satisfied with their treatment.</p> 
<p>Chiropractors enjoy a higher satisfaction rating than MD and physical 
therapy patients. Plus, chiropractic physicians are concerned with your overall 
health. Chiropractors guide you in a personalized approach to overall wellness 
- through spinal care, exercise, good nutrition, and stress management.</p> 
<h2>SwankChiro <strong>Testimonials</strong></h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I am a competitive runner and have been plagued with hip pains on long 
days. I have been to MD's, PT's, Athletic trainers, and even tried acupuncture. 
All to no avail. My friend recommended Dr. Swank.&nbsp; I have been very 
pleased with his approach and most importantly the results. I have increased my 
PR at several distances and am virtually pain free.&nbsp; My experience with 
Dr. Swank has been very good and can recommend him without reservation.- MC</p> 
<p>I was referred by a friend to Dr. Swank. I had suffered with back pain most 
of my life. All I can say is.... my pain is gone. He has got me exercising, 
eating better, and stretching. I couldn't wait to bring in my family. I think 
he is the best chiropractor in the area. - Andy C.</p> 
<p>Dr. Swank has an excellent bedside manner. I came in with lower back pain 
from an exercising injury. I must say that in the 2 years that I have been 
going here I have never felt better. Another plus is all of the ladies in the 
office know you when you arrive and you are greeted as if you are family. They 
are very accomodating with scheduling and do there best to see you on the day 
you call. I recommended Dr. Swank to my family members and co-workers&nbsp; you 
will not be disappointed.- Susan H.</p>
