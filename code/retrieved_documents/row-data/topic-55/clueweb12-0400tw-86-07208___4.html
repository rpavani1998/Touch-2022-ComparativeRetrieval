<h1>Back Pain and Chiropractic</h1> 
<p> News | February 3, 2012 by admin | 0 Comments </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Walking upright on two feet has advantages, but it also puts intense 
pressure on the spine, as well as on other muscles and bones. Add to this 
improper sitting, lifting, or reaching&mdash;and the normal wear and tear of 
working and playing&mdash;and you have the perfect recipe for back pain. 
That&rsquo;s why back pain is the 2nd most common reason for visits to the 
doctor&rsquo;s office, outnumbered only by upper-respiratory infections. In 
fact, some experts say, as many as 80% of us will experience a 
back&nbsp;problem at some time in our lives.</p> 
<p>Back injuries are a part of everyday life. They can cause a sharp pain or a 
dull ache and can be accompanied by a tingling, numbness, or burning sensation. 
You may also feel weakness, pain, or tingling in your pelvis and upper 
leg&mdash;a condition known as sciatica. The spine is quite good at dealing 
with back injuries. Minor injuries usually heal within a day or two. Some pain, 
however, continues. What makes it last longer is not entirely understood, but 
researchers suspect that stress, mood changes, and the fear of further injury 
may prevent patients from being active and exacerbate the pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Tips for Back Pain Prevention:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Maintain a healthy diet and weight.</li> 
<li>Remain active&mdash;under the supervision of your doctor of chiropractic.
</li> 
<li>Avoid prolonged inactivity or bed rest.</li> 
<li>Warm up or stretch before exercising or other physical activities, such as 
gardening.</li> 
<li>Maintain proper posture.</li> 
<li>Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes.</li> 
<li>Sleep on a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curve in your spine.
</li> 
<li>Lift with your knees, keep the object close to your body, and do not twist 
when lifting.</li> 
<li>Quit smoking. Smoking impairs blood flow, resulting in oxygen and nutrient 
deprivation to spinal tissues.</li> 
<li>Work with your doctor of chiropractic to ensure that your workstation is 
ergonomically correct.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Chiropractic Treatment for Back Pain</strong></p> 
<p><strong></strong>If you experience back pain, consult your doctor of 
chiropractic. More than 30 million Americans sought chiropractic care last year 
alone. Past studies have indicated that consumers are very happy with the 
chiropractic care they receive.</p> 
<p>With a thorough knowledge of the structure and functioning of the human 
body, doctors of chiropractic make diagnoses and take steps to correct problems 
using spinal adjustments, dietary and lifestyle advice, and other natural 
tools. Spinal manipulation&mdash;the primary form of treatment performed by 
doctors of chiropractic&mdash;is a recommended option for back pain treatment, 
rated as such by many state and workers&rsquo; compensation guidelines.</p> 
<p>Research has shown that manipulative therapy and spinal manipulation are 
not only safe and effective, but can cut costs and get workers back on the job 
faster than other treatments. A recent medical study has also pointed out that 
manual manipulation offers better short-term relief of chronic back pain than 
medication.</p>
