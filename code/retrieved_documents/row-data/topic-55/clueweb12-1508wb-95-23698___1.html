<p>Complementary Approaches</p> 
<p>Manual therapies: chiropractic, osteopathy and massage</p> 
<p> Spinal manipulation as a treatment for back pain has been practiced for 
over 100 years. Different schools of manual treatment have evolved. In the 
United States, most spinal manipulation is provided by chiropractors. The focus 
of chiropractic care is on the nervous system with adjustments of the spinal 
vertebra to improve joint, nerve and muscle function. Osteopathic care uses 
spinal manipulation in combination with conventional treatment methods.<br>
<br>
 These modalities all recognize that low back pain is not an isolated pathology 
(as is the case with many conventional approaches). It sees the musculoskeletal 
system as a unified structure that needs all parts functioning well for there 
to be proper physiology and a chance for an absence of pain. These therapeutic 
approaches therefore emphasize treatment of low back pain not just of the low 
back, but of the spine as a whole.<br>
<br>
 To date, the data from scientific 
trials on the effectiveness of manipulation for acute back pain show it to be 
an effective therapy (Shekelle, 1992). However, studies for chronic low back 
pain are not yet clear and there are insufficient high quality studies to 
support or refute its use for this condition. In a systematic review of 81 
trials of manipulation for chronic low back pain, however, 25% were high 
quality studies showing strong evidence that manipulation was effective, 
especially for specific structural conditions. Studies also suggest that when 
improvement occurs it is usually early in the course of treatment (after 6 
treatments) so that if there is no improvement in symptoms by that point, 
manipulative intervention may be ineffective in that case (Berman, 1998).<br>

<br> Further research is needed to clarify the characteristics of patients who 
have a high probability of benefiting from spinal manipulation, the optimal 
dose response of this type of therapy, the potential long-term effect, and its 
possible role in the prevention of new episodes of low back pain. Studies that 
confine manipulative therapies only to the low back and restrict use in other 
areas as part of the treatment regimen (as is common practice) may be less 
likely to show benefit.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Chiropractic.</b> Many studies and reviews have evaluated the use of 
manual therapy, including manipulation, for the treatment of chronic low back 
pain. There is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of manipulation for 
chronic low back pain. In a 1997 systematic review, strong evidence was found 
that spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain was better than placebo 
treatment and moderate evidence that it was better than treatment by a general 
practitioner, massage, bed rest and analgesics (van Tulder, 1997)<br>
<br>
 In 
another review of chiropractic spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain, 
nine out of fourteen studies reported positive benefits for manipulation over 
other interventions, three showed improvement comparable to other interventions 
and two were negative (Vernon, 1999).</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>Osteopathy.</b> Osteopathic care includes standard methods of treatment 
and manual care involving the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In a randomized 
controlled clinical trial of patients with chronic and subchronic low back pain 
(back pain for at least three weeks but less than six months), osteopathic 
manual care was compared to standard medical care. Both types of treatment had 
similar clinical results in terms of pain relief, function and satisfaction in 
patients with subacute low back pain. However the osteopathic treatment group 
receiving manual care required significantly less medication (analgesics, 
anti-inflammatory agents and muscle relaxants) and used less physical therapy 
(Andersson, 1999).</li> <br>
<br>

<li><b>Massage.</b> Massage therapy is widely used by patients for the 
treatment of chronic low back pain. Despite this widespread use there has been 
little randomized, controlled research evaluating massage as the main treatment 
option for back pain. Most studies have used massage for comparison purposes 
(as a control) while evaluating the effectiveness of spinal manipulation, TENS, 
or a lumbar corset.</li> </ol> A recent randomized study compared the 
effectiveness of acupuncture, therapeutic massage and self-care education for 
chronic low back pain. It found that therapeutic massage was effective for 
persistent low back pain in terms of improvement of symptoms and function and 
that it provided long-lasting benefits. This study used only massage techniques 
that were limited to manipulation of the soft tissues (the muscles and fascia 
that surround the muscles) (Cherkin, 2001).<br>
<br>
 In a randomized study 
comparing massage therapy and progressive muscle relaxation for chronic low 
back pain, the massage therapy group reported experiencing less pain, 
depression, anxiety, improved sleep, improved trunk and pain flexion 
performance and higher levels of serotonin and dopamine. Massage therapy was 
found to be effective in reducing pain, stress hormones, and symptoms 
associated with chronic low back pain (Hernandez-Reif, 2001).<br>
<br>
 Thus, 
despite the need for more high quality research studies to evaluate massage as 
a main treatment option, it would seem reasonable to include massage in a 
multi-modal treatment approach for certain types of chronic low back pain 
conditions.
