<h4>Managing Pain</h4> 
<p> by Jeff Crider </p> 
<p>A comprehensive approach to treating chronic pain</p> 
<p>According to the American Pain Institute, approximately 50 million people 
in the United States suffer from pain. Many of them are treated with 
prescription pain medications. Nora Volkow, MD, director of the National 
Institute on Drug Addiction, has reported that up to 7% of patients who are 
prescribed narcotic or opiate analgesics will become addicted. While most 
people take prescription medications responsibly, an estimated 48 million 
people have used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons in their lifetime.1
</p> 
<p>Some estimates indicate that more than 4.7 million Americans are dependent 
on prescription painkillers.2-4 According to the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, there has been a dramatic increase in narcotic 
analgesic abuse&mdash;117%&mdash;from 1994 to 2001.5 With these numbers, it is 
likely that PTs will come into contact with individuals abusing and/or 
dependent on prescription medication.</p> 
<h3>TWO WORLDS MEET </h3> 
<p>Jim Fent, MS, MFT, RPT, was raised with a father who suffered from chronic 
back pain and prescription pain medication abuse. Early in his career as a PT, 
Fent recognized that many of his clients exhibited the same thoughts, 
behaviors, and attitudes as his father. An intense interest in chronic pain and 
addiction developed. Fent recognized that he had the knowledge and skills to 
help people with their physical issues, but his ability and scope of practice 
stopped there.</p> 
<p>Following his passion, Fent returned to school and earned a degree in 
counseling. He recognized that health care providers needed education and 
training in this area. &quot;Many therapists,&quot; he says, &quot;don't want 
to believe or acknowledge that their patients abuse prescription medications or 
even use illegal substances, but the data indicates that it is not 
uncommon.&quot; Fent set out with a goal of helping individuals who suffer from 
chronic pain and addiction as well as teaching other health care providers how 
to recognize addiction and make appropriate referrals.</p> 
<h3>PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION</h3> 
<p>In 2002, Fent met Marcy Trutalli, MPT, CSCS, and they soon realized their 
interests and treatment styles were extremely compatible. Fent and Trutalli 
formed The Rehab Group, based in Murrieta, Calif, to specifically work with 
individuals and families experiencing chronic pain. In December 2006, The Rehab 
Group developed a working relationship with A Better Tomorrow Treatment Center, 
a CARF-accredited substance abuse treatment program also based in Murrieta, 
provides both residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment to people 
from all parts of the United States.</p> 
<h3>Additional Pain Management Products</h3> 
<p>In addition to the products mentioned within the article, here are a couple 
more to add to your must-have list.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Adroit Medical Systems</strong> (www.adroitmedical.com) offers a 
complete line of temperature therapy products, including localized heat and 
cold therapy products.</li> 
<li><strong>Sore No More</strong> (www.sorenomore.com) offers a natural 
pain-relieving gel for backaches, arthritis, bruises, etc.</li> </ul> 
<p>&quot;Our next residential client is just as likely to come from New York 
or Las Vegas as they are from California,&quot; says Jerrod Menz, director of 
program development for A Better Tomorrow. &quot;We currently have clients from 
Utah, Florida, and New York in our program.&quot; The collaboration has proved 
extremely beneficial to the clients and staff of A Better Tomorrow as well as 
The Rehab Group.</p> 
<p>By working together, the two companies can provide a broad scope of 
professional services, including physical therapy, chiropractic, massage 
therapy, psychiatry, psychology, marriage and family therapy, alcohol and drug 
counseling, interventions, case management, psychological testing, and more.</p>
<h3>PROGRAM OPTIONS</h3> 
<p>The Rehab Group offers two programs or treatment options. The first option 
is &quot;conventional&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; physical therapy. This 
program is for individuals with acute trauma, recent surgery, or pain that is 
less than 6 months in duration; or individuals who received inappropriate or 
inadequate prior treatment.</p> 
<p>The second option is the Pain Program. This program is for individuals 
whose pain or pain behaviors are interfering with work, activities of daily 
living, relationships, or sleep; who are no longer participating in or enjoying 
hobbies or recreational activities; who have failed conventional physical 
medicine treatment; who have persistent/chronic pain that has existed beyond 
the expected healing time; whose physical or mental impairment is greater than 
expected on the basis of the diagnosed medical conditions; and who are 
chemically dependent on or are abusing medication.</p> 
<h3>TREATMENT</h3> 
<p>The Rehab Group's Pain Program is different from other programs because it 
is abstinence based. Individuals in the pain program are free from all narcotic 
medications. Often, a combination of manual therapy, Empi E-stim, Thera Band, 
Orthogel, and Biofreeze are the modalities utilized. The group's collaboration 
with A Better Tomorrow offers other advantages, too. &quot;Individuals who are 
chemically dependent may begin their treatment with A Better Tomorrow's 
detoxification program,&quot; Fent says. &quot;Once stable, they transfer into 
residential treatment and the Pain Program.&quot;</p> 
<p>Treatment plans are tailored to each individual's needs with four key areas 
addressed: biological, psychological, social, and spiritual. A Better 
Tomorrow's program is 12-step based, which addresses clients' spiritual and 
recovery needs. In addition to the 12-step program, all residential clients 
exercise daily at a national fitness chain; participate in anger management, 
stress management, and chemical dependency courses; and participate in 
individual and family psychotherapy. Individuals in the Pain Program have 
access to the on-site gym and one-on-one exercise instruction with direct 
supervision by a PT.</p> 
<p>PTs use multiple methods designed to ameliorate or manage pain symptoms. 
&quot;The best treatment we provide is focused attention, hope, education, 
hands-on care, and positive communication&mdash;in essence, excellent customer 
service,&quot; Trutalli says.</p> <b></b>

<p>The aftercare plan is also a critical component of patient recovery. 
&quot;Most of the time, the aftercare plan includes Orthogel, Biofreeze, Thera 
Band, and an Empi E-stim,&quot; Fent says. &quot;We develop an extensive and 
detailed aftercare plan which includes referring people to physical therapists 
and health care providers in their area. As a result, we are building a 
national referral network,&quot; Fent says.</p> 
<h3>RESULTS AND OUTCOMES</h3> 
<p>So far, the results have been excellent. In addition to the positive client 
feedback, The Rehab Group uses the Pain Outcomes Profile recommended by the 
American Academy of Pain Management. A future goal for The Rehab Group is to 
obtain Pain Program Accreditation through the American Academy of Pain 
Management.</p>
