<p> <b>Acupuncture and acupressure:</b> </p>
<p>This has been a major component of Chinese medicine for more than 2,500 
years. The theory is that essential life energy- called qi- flows through the 
body along invisible channels called meridians. Imbalance in the flow of qi 
leads to illness. Stimulation of specific points along meridians can correct 
the abnormality of flow and thus heal illness.</p>
<p>Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into the skin at 
predetermined meridian points. Acupressure is a method where pressure is 
applied to these points but no needle is inserted.</p>
<p>How acupuncture works is still unclear. Several processes have been 
proposed to explain acupuncture effects. Three main mechanisms are:</p>
<p>&#149; Conduction of electromagnetic signals. These signals may start the 
flow of pain-killing bio chemicals such as endorphins and of immune cells to 
injured sites in the body.</p>
<p>&#149; Activation of opioid systems in the central nervous system leading 
to pain reduction.</p>
<p>&#149; Changes in brain chemistry, sensation, and involuntary body 
functions. Release of neurotransmitters and neurohormones is affected.</p>
<p> Acupuncture is usually performed by a trained Chinese medicine specialist 
who will take a history and perform a physical examination. Very fine needles 
will be inserted at specific points. Sometimes these needles are attached to 
electrical current. Multiple needles may be inserted at different points. A 
session lasts about 20-30 minutes. Acute conditions will generally respond 
quicker than chronic conditions. Acupuncture often requires more than one 
session. While pain relief is often achieved, reduction of inflammation is not 
as readily noted. Acupuncture may involve follow-up treatments.</p>
<p>The primary certifying organization is the national Certification 
Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Medical doctors who perform 
acupuncture may belong to the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture.</p>
<p>Make sure the acupuncturist is licensed and certified. Make doubly sure 
they use sterile single use disposable needles.</p>
<p>Inquire as to activity level permitted before and after treatments. </p>
<p>If you aren&#146;t better within six or so sessions, you may not improve. 
</p>
<p>If herbs are dispensed, make sure you are told about potential 
side-effects. Be careful if you are taking other medicines. There may be 
interaction between your medicines and the herbs.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Worth looking into </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Aromatherapy</b> </p>
<p>One of the most primitive parts of the brain is the olfactory lobe. This 
governs the sense of smell and the sense of smell is one of the most powerful 
senses we have. Smell can elicit pleasant or unpleasant memories of the past. 
Smell can also change the way you feel. Think of the smell of freshly baked 
bread!</p>
<p>Aromatherapy uses different scents to create a sense of well-being. The 
goal is to induce calm, relieve stress and pain, and promote healing.</p>
<p>Scents such as lilac or lavender seem to have soothing effects. Whether 
this translates to an actual healing potential is difficult to say. Studies are 
sparse.</p>
<p>Bottom line: pleasant but unproven </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Ayer Veda</b> </p>
<p>This is an ancient (more than 5,000 years old) Indian healing tradition. 
The theory is that all of existence consists of life energy (called prana) and 
five key elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether). The life energy and the 
elements are expressed as three physiologic energies, called doshas.</p>
<p>The five elements are constantly shifting within the doshas. Health is 
achieved by maintaining harmony among the elements and the life energy within 
the doshas.</p>
<p>Balance is achieved through the use of meditation, purification, yoga, 
massage, a vegetarian diet, and breathing exercises, called pranayama.</p>
<p>An Ayer Vedic physician will take a history and perform a physical 
examination. They will evaluate your dosha and prescribe a regimen of 
exercises, yoga (asanas), herbs, meditation, and breathing.</p>
<p>Digestion and elimination are key components of Ayer Vedic medicine. 
Purification regimens called panchakarma will be instituted. Among the elements 
involved are fasting, colon cleansing, and massage.</p>
<p>Ayer Vedic medicine makes sense in its advocacy of a healthy lifestyle 
(vegetarian diet, exercise, meditation).</p>
<p>Practitioners may belong to the National Institute of Ayer Vedic medicine. 
</p>
<p>As with other health care practitioners, make sure you let the Ayer Vedic 
practitioner know what medicines you take. If herbs are given, make sure you 
know what they are and what type of interactions to expect with the medicines 
you already take.</p>
<p>If colon cleansing is recommended, make absolutely sure all equipment and 
facilities are clean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bottom line: worth looking into </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Bee Venom</b> </p>
<p>This used to be considered hocus-pocus. No longer. There is evidence that 
been venom contains at least eighteen powerful anti inflammatory compounds that 
can relieve pain. In addition, bee venom stimulates the release of cortisol, 
dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, all of which help relieve the pain, 
stiffness, and swelling of arthritis. Very few physicians will administer this 
therapy. Beekeepers found through the American Apitherapy Society may be 
helpful resources.</p>
<p>Use caution. Anaphylactic shock and death is a potential side-effect. </p>
<p>Bottom line: be very, very careful </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Biofeedback</b> </p>
<p>This is a method that teaches people how to control a specific body 
function. It has been especially useful in reducing stress, relieving anxiety, 
reducing muscle spasm, alleviating pain, and improving gastrointestinal 
problems.</p>
<p>Sensors are placed on the body and these are connected to a computer. The 
computer measures a variety of parameters including skin temperature, heart 
rate, or brain waves.</p>
<p>The patient is taught relaxation or visualization exercises. At the same 
time, the computer provides feedback in the form of sounds or lights. Over 
time, the patient finds that he or she can elicit the physical response by 
following the cues provided by the computer.</p>
<p>Two arthritis conditions where biofeedback has been found to be 
particularly effective are fibromyalgia and Raynaud&#146;s phenomenon.</p>
<p>Biofeedback devices are relatively inexpensive. And biofeedback training is 
provided by many physical therapists and medical doctors.</p>
<p>Bottom line: can be useful </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Chinese medicine</b> </p>
<p>This medical discipline is focused on two concepts: first, balance 
involving yin (feminine) and yang (masculine); second, qi or life force. Qi 
flows through the body along invisible channels called meridians. Illness 
occurs when the normal flow of qi is disrupted.</p>
<p>Treatments are aimed at maintaining proper flow of qi and maintaining the 
optimal balance between yin and yang.</p>
<p>This is accomplished through a number of practices including gentle 
exercises (tai chi, qi dong), acupuncture, acupressure, massage, cupping (using 
special suction cups applied at specific points along meridians to remove 
impediments to the flow of qi), moxibustion (using special herbs attached to 
acupuncture needles... the herbs are then lit. The heat draws the impediment to 
qi away from the body), and Chinese herbs.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand what herbs you are going to take and what type of 
interaction there may be with the medicines you are taking. If you decide on 
acupuncture, make sure the needles are sterile, disposable, single use needles.
</p>
<p>Bottom Line: worth trying </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Chiropractic</b> </p>
<p>The theory is that misalignment of the spinal vertebrae is responsible for 
all diseases. Why? Because, the body is affected by the nervous system. The 
nervous system runs down through the spinal cord and can be adversely affected 
by spinal dysfunction. By adjusting these misalignments (subluxations), 
chiropractors feel they can cure various disorders.</p>
<p>Most chiropractors do a combination of spinal manipulation and other 
techniques such as ultrasound, electrical stimulation, massage, herbs, 
vitamins, and dietary counseling. Some also perform acupuncture.</p>
<p>A chiropractor will take a history and do a physical examination. He or she 
may order x-rays.</p>
<p>The patient is placed on a special table. Pressure is then applied to ease 
the spine or joint into proper alignment. Sometimes the pressure is gentle; 
other times it may be vigorous and forceful.</p>
<p>Chiropractors go through intensive training. When they receive their degree 
they are called doctors of chiropractic (D.C.) Chiropractors, like any 
practitioner, will vary widely in expertise and experience. Chiropractors are 
not permitted to dispense medicines or perform surgery. If you don&#146;t get 
better within 4 weeks, you probably won&#146;t improve.</p>
<p>Chiropractic treatment has helped millions of people. While it may not be 
effective for internal disorders, it seems to be very helpful for many patients 
with acute low back and neck problems.</p>
<p>Use extreme caution if you have osteoporosis or rheumatoid arthritis since 
serious injury may result from manipulation.</p>
<p>Bottom line: worth trying. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Color therapy</b> </p>
<p>Colors influence the way we think at a subconscious level. Why this happens 
is unclear. Large corporations spend millions of dollars annually trying to 
find the right colors that will attract customers. For instance, red, orange, 
and yellow stimulate the appetite. Do you think the fast food industry has 
picked up on that? Does this have an effect in arthritis? Your guess is as good 
as mine.</p>
<p>Bottom line: thumbs down </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Copper bracelets</b> </p>
<p>The amount of copper you get from one of these is less than you can get 
from a good nutritional supplement. Save your money and use the nutritional 
supplement. If you want to get one because you think they look cool, then 
that&#146;s different.</p>
<p>Bottom line: won&#146;t help your arthritis </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Food therapy</b> </p>
<p>Arthritis may be helped or aggravated by certain foods. Diets high in 
saturated fat are probably pro-inflammatory while diets high in omega-3 fish 
oils are anti-inflammatory. Examples of these are sardines, mackerel, herring, 
lake trout, salmon, blue fish, and mullet.</p>
<p>A diet high in purines will aggravate gout (see Gout). </p>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that allergies to certain foods may make aches and 
pains worse. For some people, getting tested for IgG food allergies may make 
sense. Immuno Laboratories in Fort Lauderdale, Florida has a good assay.</p>
<p>Other diets such as avoiding nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, eggplant, 
peppers) may help some people. Fasting has been advocated and may work 
temporarily. The same goes for vegetarian diets. Dairy products seem to make 
arthritis worse in some people.</p>
<p>For sure, if you&#146;re overweight, that&#146;s going to make 
weight-bearing joints such as the low back and knees worse.</p>
<p>Bottom line: worth looking into if nothing else is working. Maintaining 
ideal weight is key.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Guided imagery</b> </p>
<p>Also known as visualization, this form lf alternative therapy costs nothing 
and is extremely valuable. To achieve the end result, you are taught how to 
enter a state of deep relaxation. You then are guided by voice to visualize the 
desired outcome or goal Sometimes, the images in your mind that you are guided 
to are past experiences that have been happy times for you. Other images may be 
peaceful relaxing places such as a babbling brook or a stretch of white beach. 
Guided imagery has been used as a healing process and a pain relieving therapy. 
So the picture that might be suggested to you to visualize is a healthy pain 
free you doing an enjoyable activity.</p>
<p>Sometimes guided imagery is used as &#147;practice&#148; before a major 
event such as giving a speech or engaging in an athletic competition. By 
visualizing the process ahead of time, it is possible to improve performance. 
Athletes and actors do this all the time.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that guided imagery may improve immune function. For 
sure, it can help patients to cope better.</p>
<p>While there are instructors who can help with this, there are also many 
excellent books and tapes available. It is not a difficult technique to master.
</p>
<p>Bottom line: definitely worth doing </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Homeopathy</b> </p>
<p>Founded by Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century, homeopathy is based on the 
premise that there is a vital life force in all living creatures. If stimulated 
by a small amount of the proper remedy, the body will heal itself.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Treatment is designed to administer 
remedies that create the same type of symptoms (&#147;like cures like&#148;)</p>
<p>The weaker the remedy, the stronger the response by the body. Homeopathic 
remedies are very diluted.</p>
<p>A homeopathic physician will take a history and perform an examination. 
They will then recommend a remedy. Since these remedies are so diluted, they 
are regulated as over-the-counter medicines by the FDA.</p>
<p>Homeopathy is generally safe. Make sure you do not stop any conventional 
medicines suddenly. And make your homeopathic physician aware of what medicines 
you are taking.</p>
<p>Bottom line: worth trying </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Magnets</b> </p>
<p>Magnets have been felt to have mystical powers for centuries. These hold a 
mysterious allure. Nearly $150 million worth of magnets are sold as medical 
products annually in the United States.</p>
<p>Some small studies have demonstrated beneficial effects for patients with 
painful conditions. Despite multiple claims of positive effect and just as many 
studies indicating negative effect, the jury remains out.</p>
<p>Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy does have beneficial effects. Studies 
done in osteoarthritis of the knee have confirmed a positive albeit mild to 
moderate effect on pain relief. The data regarding the smaller static magnets 
though is less compelling. We looked at magnets a few years ago at our center. 
For every patient that seemed to get better, there was another patient who did 
not.</p>
<p>Bottom line: probably a placebo effect. There&#146;s nothing wrong with 
that if it works for you</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Moxibustion</b> </p>
<p>This is the practice burning specific herbs, generally, mugwort, at 
specific acupuncture points. The herbs are placed on top of the acupuncture 
needle as it is placed at a meridian point. Bottom line: it works</p>
<p><b>Music therapy</b> </p>
<p>Soothing music may help you feel better. In one study, students who 
listened to Mozart actually did better on exams than those who either listened 
to something else or who did not listen to any music. It certainly can't hurt.
</p>
<p>Bottom line: no data in arthritis </p>
<p><b>Naturopathy</b> </p>
<p>This is the prototypical holistic medical approach. Naturopathic physicians 
encourage good habits, exercise, proper attitudes, lifestyle changes that will 
allow the body to heal itself.</p>
<p>Among the treatments that might be administered are homeopathy, herbs, 
nutritional counseling, and massage.</p>
<p>Many naturopathic physicians have training in other areas such as 
acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese medicine, and Ayer Vedic medicine.</p>
<p>A naturopathic physician will take a history and do a physical examination. 
They will then recommend lifestyle changes and nutritional counseling.</p>
<p>Bottom line: worth looking into </p>
<p><b>Neurolinguistic Programming</b> </p>
<p>Developed by two scientists, Bandler and Grinder, neurolinguistic 
programming or NLP is a method of programming your brain using different types 
of visualization exercises. It seems to help with some phobias. It has also 
been used by athletes and business executives. As with guided imagery, NLP may 
be helpful but there is no data in arthritis patients.</p>
<p>Bottom line: no data available </p>
<p><b>Osteopathic medicine</b> </p>
<p>Traditional osteopathic physicians believed that the musculoskeletal system 
regulated the health of the entire organism. A problem with the musculoskeletal 
system could cause disease... and conversely, disease could cause an 
abnormality in the musculoskeletal system. If structural problems were 
corrected, the body could heal.</p>
<p>Also, it was believed that improved blood flow could ameliorate disease and 
that manipulation techniques could improve blood flow.</p>
<p>Osteopaths often will recommend soft tissue manipulation much like 
chiropractors.</p>
<p>Today, osteopaths have the same level of training as MDs. They often will 
go through the same residency and fellowship training that MDs do.</p>
<p>They do tend to place more of an emphasis on musculoskeletal health. </p>
<p>Bottom line: Yes </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Yoga</b> </p>
<p>An important part of Ayer Veda, yoga has been practiced for thousands of 
years. Yoga can improve muscle strength, balance, flexibility, and promote a 
sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Breathing techniques unique to yoga may help combat fatigue and increase 
mental sharpness.</p>
<p>Several schools of yoga exist. They are based on a certain set of postures 
called asanas and breathing techniques called pranayama.</p>
<p>A recent study indicated yoga may be effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. 
An older study has shown effectiveness in osteoarthritis of the hand.</p>
<p>For patients with arthritis, yoga provides a full body low impact workout. 
It is important to find a good instructor, particularly one with experience in 
managing arthritis.</p>
<p>Studies in the literature do support a positive effect in helping patient 
with osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Yes&#133; try it </p>
