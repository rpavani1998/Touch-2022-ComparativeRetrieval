<h1>Kinesio Taping</h1> 
<p>Kinesio taping is a method used to help normalize the function of muscles 
and other connective tissues. We may use taping as a part of your therapy, and 
also offer tape for your ongoing use at home.</p> 
<p>Kineso taping uses elastic tape rather than the rigid tape traditionally 
used in sports. The elastic properties of this tape help in many ways:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Improve contraction of a weakened muscle </li> 
<li>Reduce muscle fatigue and spasm </li> 
<li>Reduce over-stretching and over-contraction of muscles </li> 
<li>Re-educate muscles through sensory feedback </li> 
<li>Lessen edema (swelling) through aiding the lymphatic system </li> 
<li>Minimize post-traumatic or post-surgical bruising through improved 
circulation</li> 
<li>Help mobilize scar tissue by enhancing glide between tissue layers </li> 
<li>Help correct joint mechanics through aiding muscle function around the 
joint</li> 
<li>Relieve pain by activating the natural analgesic system in our skin 
receptors</li> </ul> 
<p>As a part of physical therapy, Kinesio taping is best used as an adjunct to 
therapy and exercise. It can dramatically speed the rehabilitation process by 
lessening pain and improving tolerance to exercise and movement. The success of 
Kinesio taping strongly depends on clinician knowledge. A thorough evaluation 
is integral to determine which taping techniques are indicated. For instance, 
the clinician must know if the patient needs taping to assist muscle 
strengthening or to assist muscle relaxation, as the taping will be different. 
A good physical therapy program goes hand-in-hand with good taping.</p> 
<p><strong>Kinesio Taping: What is it?</strong> Dr. Kenzo Kase nearly 20 years 
ago developed this taping technique for the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation 
Clinics in Japan. Since this introduction of Kinesio Taping into the U.S., 
medical practitioners have recognized and embraced this effective, safe, and 
easy-to-use modality. The method and tape allow the individual to wear and 
receive the therapeutic benefits on a 24-hours/day basis, and can be worn for 
several days per application. Currently, Kinesio Taping is practiced in 
clinics, high schools, and by professional sports teams.</p> 
<p>The Kinesio Taping method involves taping over and around muscles in order 
to either: assist and give muscle support, or to prevent over contraction of 
the muscles. The first technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to 
actually give support with full range of motion that enables the individual to 
participate in physical activity with functional assistance. The second 
technique helps fight against overuse/contraction and helps provide 24 
hours/day facilitation of lymphatic fluid. This technique is most commonly used 
in the acute state of rehabilitation. Lastly, there are many types of 
correctional techniques such as: myofascial, lymph, and tracking (i.e., patella 
[knee cap]) Kinesio Tape can be best used in conjunction with Physical Therapy 
treatments.</p> 
<p><strong>How does this work?</strong> Kinesio Taping alleviates pain and 
facilitates lymphatic drainage by lifting the skin. The taped portion forms 
convolutions in the skin this increasing interstitial space. The result is that 
pressure and irritation are taken off the neural/sensory receptors. Slowly 
pressure is taken off the lymphatic system allowing it to drain more freely.</p>
<p>Kinesio Taping is a technique based on the body's own natural healing 
process. This Kinesio Taping exhibits its efficacy through the activation of 
neurological and circulatory systems. This method basically stems from the 
science of Kinesiology, hence the name &quot;Kinesio&quot;. Muscles are not 
only attributed to the movements of the body but also control the circulation 
of venous and lymph flows, body temperature, etc. Therefore, the failure of the 
muscles to function properly induces various kinds of symptoms.</p> 
<p>Consequently, so much attention was given to the importance of muscle 
function that the idea of treating the muscles in order to activate the body's 
own healing process came about. Using an elastic tape, it was discovered that 
muscles and other tissues could be helped by outside assistance. Employment of 
Kinesio Taping creates a totally new approach to treating nerves, muscles, and 
organs. The first application of Kinesio Taping was for a patient with 
articular disorders. Kinesio Tape is used for anything from headaches to foot 
problems and everything in between.</p> 
<p>Examples include: muscular facilitation or inhibition in pediatric 
patients, carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back strain/pain (subluxations, 
herniated disc), knee conditions, shoulder conditions, hamstring, groin injury, 
rotator cuff injury, whiplash, tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, patella 
tracking, pre and post surgical edema, ankle sprains, athletic preventative 
injury method, and as a support method.</p> 
<p>Kinesio tape facilitates normal motion, decreases edema, improves pain and 
facilitates biomechanical alignment. Elastic tape is water resistant, durable 
and easy to wear, usually 3-5 days, latex free and generally very well 
tolerated.</p> 
<p>Elastic taping is not just for athletes. We utilize this intervention for 
support and pain relief for post-operative conditions, acute injury, back pain, 
during pregnancy, with children and adolescents, scoliosis, for postural 
support, sacroiliac (SI) dysfunction and many other conditions. It is an 
adjunct to our manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education, therapeutic exercise 
and modalities to return people to pain-free living without surgery or 
medication.</p> <br>
