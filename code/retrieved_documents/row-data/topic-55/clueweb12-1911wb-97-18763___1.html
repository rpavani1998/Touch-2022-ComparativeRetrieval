<h2> What is Physical Therapy?</h2>

dysfunction and enhancement of physical limitations. Treatment is directed 
toward the restoration, maintenance and promotion of optimal physical function. 
Treatment includes the recovery of current symptoms and the prevention of the 
progression of impairments, functional limitations, and disabilities that may 
result from diseases, disorders, conditions, and/or injuries.</p>
