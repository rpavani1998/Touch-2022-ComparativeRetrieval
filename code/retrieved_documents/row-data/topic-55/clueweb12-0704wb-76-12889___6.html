<p>Physical therapy often takes a hands-on approach, which may make you cringe 
if you're experiencing pain from multiple hypersensitivetender points. However, 
physical therapy uses methods that are gentle, effective, and will most likely 
play a major role in managing your fibromyalgia symptoms.</p> 
<p>There are a variety of physical therapy techniques. Passive treatments 
relax your body and include deep tissue massage, heat therapy, hydrotherapy, 
electric muscle stimulation, and ultrasound.</p> 
<p>Your physical therapy program will usually begin with passive treatments. 
When you feel ready, you will start active treatments that strengthen your body 
and prevent further fibromyalgia pain. Your physical therapist will work with 
you to develop a plan that best suits you.</p>  You may be interested in these

<p><strong>Passive Treatments </strong></p> <br>

<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Deep Tissue Massage: </strong>Unless you're in an extreme amount 
of pain, deep tissue massage is an ideal fibromyalgia treatment because it uses 
a great deal of pressure to relieve deep muscle tension and spasms. Spasms 
prevent muscle motion at the affected level, which is one of the reasons people 
with fibromyalgia experience a decreased range of motion. Physical therapy 
techniques, including deep tissue massage, will help you use your muscles more 
effectively. This treatment may be combined with heat or cold therapies to 
boost the benefits.</li> 
<li><strong>Heat Therapy: </strong>Heat therapy is one of the most preferred 
methods of reducing chronic aches and pains associated with fibromyalgia. Heat 
triggers the body's natural healing process by relaxing your muscles and 
speeding up blood flow to the affected area. Extra blood delivers extra oxygen 
and nutrients. Blood also removes waste byproducts from muscle spasms.<br>
<br>

 Heat may not completely eliminate the source of your pain, but it can 
effectively reduce your pain. This therapy is used in a couple of 
ways&mdash;through dry heat (a heating pad or a dry, hot towel) or moist heat 
(steam heat or a moist, warm cloth).<br>
<br>
 When using heat therapy on your 
own after physical therapy ends, never overheat painful areas. If you're using 
a heating pad, set it to low or medium. When using a hot towel, touch it first 
to make sure it's not too hot. Excessive heat may not only exacerbate your 
fibromyalgia pain but also potentially cause burns.<b><br>
</b></li> 
<li><strong>Hydrotherapy: </strong>As the name suggests, hydrotherapy involves 
water. As a passive treatment, hydrotherapy may simply involve sitting in a 
whirlpool bath to relieve pain, relax muscles, and condition your body without 
adding unnecessary stress.</li> 
<li><strong>Electric Muscle Stimulation: </strong>&nbsp;Electric muscle 
stimulation sounds intense, but it really isn't painful. This technique reduces 
muscle spasms and is generally believed to trigger the release of endorphins, 
which are your body's natural pain killers.</li> 
<li><strong>Ultrasound: </strong>This therapy uses sound waves to create a 
gentle heat that increases blood circulation to your deep tissues. Ultrasound 
helps reduce muscle spasms, inflammation, stiffness, and pain and is most 
effective in relieving range of motion limitations in chronic pain sufferers, 
as opposed to those with acute inflammatory conditions.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Active Treatments </strong><br>
 Active treatments help address 
core stability, flexibility, strength, and joint movement. An exercise program 
may also be prescribed to achieve optimal results. This will not only curb 
recurrent pain but will also benefit your overall health. Your physical 
therapist will work with you to develop a program based on your specific 
symptoms and health history.</p> 
<p>Active treatments include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Core stability: </strong>Your core (abdominal) muscles have a 
greater impact on your overall health than you may think. Strong core muscles 
serve as good allies to your back muscles in supporting your spine. It's called 
the core because it's the central powerhouse of your body. Naturally, a healthy 
core provides your body with a strong, stable center point.</li> 
<li><strong>Muscle flexibility and strengthening:</strong> Your range of 
motion will likely be restricted if you're experiencing fibromyalgia pain. 
Using customizedstretching and strengthening exercises, your physical therapist 
will help you lengthen and strengthen your muscles, and improve joint movement. 
Strong, lean muscles better handle pain.</li> 
<li><strong>Hydrotherapy: </strong>Water-based exercises may be recommended to 
provide gentle aerobic conditioning.</li> </ul> 
<p>Your physical therapist will teach you self-care principles so you 
understand how to best treat your symptoms. The ultimate goal is for you to 
develop the knowledge to help control your symptoms. It's essential that you 
learn the exercises and continue them after the formal therapy ends. If you 
fail to keep with a fitness regimen, you won't enjoy long-term results from 
your physical therapy. By taking care of your back on your own, you'll reduce 
further fibromyalgia pain.</p>  Updated on: 01/04/10
