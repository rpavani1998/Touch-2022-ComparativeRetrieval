<h1>Marijuana Better Than Chiropractic For Back Pain?</h1> 
<p>May 25th, 2010 Alexandra Carmichael  Posted in Infographics, Research 
Findings | 4 Comments &raquo; </p> For the interactive version of this 
infographic and some statistical geekery,click here. 
<p>When your back hurts, is your first thought, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the 
marijuana?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing not.</p> 
<p>But Back Pain is the #2 condition at CureTogether, with 1188 people 
reporting their experiences, and this is their collective wisdom. If you look 
at the infographic above,<strong>the most popular and effective treatments 
reported are on the top right &ndash; hot packs, physical therapy, stretching, 
exercise, massage</strong>.</p> 
<p>The top left quadrant shows below-average usage, but above-average 
effectiveness, so presumably if more people tried these, they would be helped (
<strong>marijuana</strong>, Oxycodone, yoga, and Pilates).</p> 
<p>Those in the lower-right quadrant have above-average usage but 
below-average effectiveness, so presumably if fewer people tried these, they 
would be free to find more effective treatments elsewhere (<strong>chiropractic 
adjustments</strong>, ice packs, Ibuprofen).</p> 
<p>Where did this data come from? CureTogether members have been anonymously 
sharing symptoms and treatments for almost 2 years now. We anonymized, 
analyzed, and visualized the data into infographic form to make it more 
accessible. To thank everyone for their contributions, we&rsquo;re releasing 
this result back to the community for free.</p> 
<p>This is the fifth in a series of infographics we&rsquo;ll be publishing 
over the coming weeks. Stay tuned and please give your feedback or thoughts on 
this result in the comments below &ndash; or write to me at
alexandra@curetogether.com.</p> 
<p>Please tweet, blog, or pass this along to anyone who can benefit or is 
interested in Back Pain. Thank you!</p> <br>

<p>Chiropractic is always better than Marijuana, it&rsquo;s a very wrong thing 
to believe that Marijuana is better.</p> </li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the chiro above.Obvious bias. I get regular 
treatments and they only last a day or so at best and then the pain is back. I 
have quit smoking Marijuana for 3 weeks now- for other reasons- and never had 
this much constant pain before. They say the majority of symptoms are 
psychosomatic so if marijuana takes your mind off your pain it is being 
effective.</p> </li>

<p>Chiropractic saves patients money by reducing their need for pain 
medication. Many drugs merely mask pain without addressing its underlying 
cause. Chiropractic goes to the root of the problem, helping patients live 
pain-free without the use of medication.</p> </li>

<p>I would never suggest using marijuana for back pain. That is a temporary 
solution whereas seeing a professional and trained chiropractor is going to do 
a lot more good for you in the short term and in the long run.</p> </li> </ol>
