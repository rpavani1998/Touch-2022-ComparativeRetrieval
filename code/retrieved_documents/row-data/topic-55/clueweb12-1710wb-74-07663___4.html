 There are no better compliments than direct referrals and positive 
experiences shared by our patients.<br>
 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TRUST!</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;The entire staff at REHABILITY is super friendly, caring, and 
professional. I have never felt more welcome in any doctor&rsquo;s office as I 
do there. The treatment I received was top notch, and the pain relief I have 
experienced has been amazing. Thanks a million!&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><strong><em>Judy W., Freehold</em></strong></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;I have been to many chiropractors in the past, but the overall 
analysis and treatment of my condition by Dr. Chickara and his colleagues has 
been second to none. Beside the Chiropractic care, Dr. Chickara has taught me 
so much about my injury, and how best to prevent such recurrences down the 
road. I am so thankful I was referred to his office.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><strong><em>Justin M., Marlboro</em></strong></p> 
<p><em>&quot;The REHABILITY Pain and Injury center has been a terrific 
experience for both my husband and I. Suffering from back pain for many years, 
we would always rely on pain medication because it was easy and available. 
However, once we learned how Physical Therapy and Chiropractic Care can provide 
such great relief, we understood why Dr. Chickara&rsquo;s practice came so 
highly recommended. Thanks again for all your help!&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><strong><em>Shannon and Mike G., Freehold</em></strong></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;I was referred to Dr. Chickara by my Neurologist after 
undergoing a significant mount of diagnostic tests for my low back and leg 
pain. The exam I received, and the explanation he had given me on the results 
was more thorough than anything I can remember. The treatment plan he set up 
for me not only focused on pain relief, but also on helping me regain some of 
my lost strength due to injury. I would have never imagined I&rsquo;d get the 
results that I have, in just 8 weeks. Your office is a class act.&rdquo;</em>

<p><em>&quot;Dr. Chickara, You and your group make a difference! From the time 
I walked through your door, a stranger coming in looking for the 
&quot;magic&quot; potion that would make me feel better. &hellip;Well I found 
it at &quot;REHABILITY&quot;! No smoke, no potions, just a combination of 
talented and caring individuals who enjoy what they do, and do it well.&quot;

<p><em>&quot;I came to your facility seeking relief from lower back pain. 
After a few months of a combination of chiropractic treatments and physical 
therapy, I'm 95% pain free. I really feel the integrated therapy helped and I 
continue to do the exercises I was taught. Thank you for giving me my life (and 
my golf game) back!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Six years ago I moved from Staten Island to Freehold and in need 
of a chiropractor. I was now 52 years old and not happy about finding someone 
new. I came across an advertisement of Dr. Chickara's who was just starting his 
practice in Freehold and offering a complementary consultation. We met and had 
a long conversation about my condition. I was very interested because his 
method of treatment is very &quot;hands on&quot; which is what I was familiar 
with. Over the last 3 years of being with Dr. Chickara, I not only respect his 
knowledge but the fact that is also concerned about his patient's overall well 
being. I never feel dismissed or rushed but comfortable in knowing he and his 
staff are truly concerned. There are times when I leave his office after being 
treated and not feeling well and he has called to find out how I am.<br>
 Dr. 
Chickara is always finding new ways to improve his patients well being with 
updated equipment and technology. He takes the time to explain each new piece 
of equipment and always makes it clear that he will do what you are comfortable 
with or whenever you are ready to try something new.<br>
My husband and I are 
truly grateful for having found Dr. Chickara. We have recommended him to 
several of our friends and family and they have nothing but praise for the 
level of care they received.<br>
 We thank you Dr. Chickara. You are your staff 
are ACES with us!!!</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;After a very serious motor vehicle accident in which I herniated 
5 discs (2 of which required surgery), I was referred to REHABILITY by my 
surgeon for rehabilitative care. I was treated by Dr Chickara and the Physical 
Therapy staff. I can honestly say that the quality of professionalism and care 
was second to none. I went from it being questionable to be able to return to 
work, to being all but pain free and back to work, not being &quot;afraid&quot; 
to resume all activities. Thank You REHABILITY for giving me my activity filled 
life back!&quot;</em></p>
