<p><strong>TESTAMONIAL</strong></p> 
<p>Dear Care Medical Center,</p> <br>

<p>I had an accident&nbsp;8 months ago and injured my back while exercising. I 
went to see&nbsp;many Doctors all over Florida&nbsp;with&nbsp;a copy of my MRI 
results showing multiple herniated and bulging discs in my lumbar 
spine.&nbsp;Not one of them said they could help me and they all told me I 
needed&nbsp;surgery on my low back. After 8 months of severe pain, no sleep, 
and numbness /&nbsp;tingling in my right leg, I contacted my daughter in 
Georgia. I also called my church to put me on their prayer list. My daughter 
told me she used to work for this excellent chiropractor&nbsp;who helped many 
people get healed without surgery.&nbsp;So, I contacted Dr. Ryan Moorman and he 
spoke with me for an extended period over the phone. He was very understanding 
and listened&nbsp;to my every concern and told me that he&nbsp;believed that he 
could help me. Finally, the first person who gave&nbsp;me hope and felt 
that&nbsp;I could get better without surgery. I drove 5 hours to see Dr. 
Moorman the next Monday and he read my MRI results. He looked at my MRI and 
said to me for the first time in 8 months that not only could he get me out of 
pain, but my injury could actually heal. He advised me to undergo a series of 
painless non-surgical spinal decompression therapy treatments called VAX-D. 
After only 2 treatments I could feel the sensation in my right leg for the 
first time in 8 months. I was able to sit, stand and walk without the severe 
pain and numbness in my leg. I was finally able to get some sleep without pain 
and without pain medications. I feel Dr. Moorman has been a blessing to me when 
no one gave me any hope. I feel great and feel like I am living again! I have 
finished 3 weeks of treatment and close to 100% better without surgery. I would 
recommend anyone who is considering having back surgery to please contact Dr. 
Ryan Moorman and his staff at Care Medical Center first. He helped me and he 
can help you too. Thanks again for your help.</p> <br>
