<h3>What is Magnetic Therapy?</h3> 
<p>Magnetic therapy is based on the theory that when delivered directly to the 
body magnetic fields can stimulate healing from a range of health problems. 
Although its health claims include the treatment of multiple sclerosis,
fibromyalgia, arthritis, insomnia, inflammation, and even cancer and heart 
disease, there is little scientific evidence for magnetic therapy's 
effectiveness.</p> 
<h3>How Does Magnetic Therapy Work?</h3> 
<p>Magnet therapy takes many different forms. In some cases, magnets are 
applied to illness-affected areas with the help of wraps, shoe inserts, 
self-adhesive strips, belts, or &quot;magnetic jewelry&quot; like bracelets, 
necklaces, and earrings. Other products include magnetic mattress pads and 
blankets, as well as magnetic-field-generating machines and even 
magnet-conditioned water.</p> 
<p>Since scientific support for its use is so limited, it's difficult to 
determine how magnetic therapy might promote healing. However, proponents 
maintain that magnets can stimulate circulation, relax the blood vessels, 
increase endorphin levels, reduce muscle tension, and normalize metabolic 
functioning.</p> 
<h3>Magnetic Therapy Research</h3> 
<p>Even though claims that magnetic therapy can treat diseases like cancer and 
multiple sclerosis are unfounded, there is some evidence that it may help 
relieve pain related to these chronic conditions:</p> 
<p><b>1) Arthritis</b></p> 
<p>In a 2004 study of 194 adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, 
researchers found that those who wore magnetic bracelets for 12 weeks had a 
decrease in arthritis-associated pain. Meanwhile, a 2001 study of 64 people 
with rheumatoid arthritis of the knee showed that 68% of those who used 
magnetic therapy reported feeling better or much better after one week.</p>

arthritis.</p> 
<p><b>2) Chronic Pelvic Pain</b></p> 
<p>For a 2002 study of 32 women with chronic pelvic pain, one group of 
patients had active or placebo magnets applied to their abdomens for 24 hours a 
day. After four weeks of continuous use, those who received the active magnets 
reported significantly lower pain levels than at the start of the study.</p> 
<p><b>3) Fibromyalgia</b></p> 
<p>After six weeks of sleeping on magnetized mattress pads, 13 women with 
fibromyalgia reported significantly less pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and 
next-day tiredness. A control group of 12 women (who slept on non-magnetized 
mattresses) had smaller improvements in pain, sleep, fatigue, and tiredness. 
The study's authors note that improvements in both groups might have been due 
to use of a better mattress pad.</p> 
<h3>More Science on Magnetic Therapy</h3> 
<p>There is also evidence that magnetic therapy may help reduce neck pain, 
post-polio pain, and diabetic foot pain. But in studies on the use of magnetic 
therapy for relief of chronic lowback pain and wrist pain related to carpal 
tunnel syndrome, researchers found magnets no more effective than placebo 
treatments.</p> 
<p>Magnetic therapy may show promise in the treatment of female urinary 
continence, however: In a 2004 study of 24 patients, 58% of participants showed 
improvement after eight weeks of receiving twice-weekly magnetic stimulation of 
the pelvic floor.</p> 
<h3>Cautions</h3> 
<p>If you're undergoing radiology, it's important to avoid the use of magnetic 
devices. Pregnant women and people with cardiac pacemakers should also forego 
magnetic therapy.</p> 
<p>In addition, it's important to consult a healthcare professional about the 
condition you're seeking to alleviate through magnetic therapy, rather than 
letting a potential serious health problem go untreated.</p>
