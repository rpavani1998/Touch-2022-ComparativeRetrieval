<h1>Class Act: Is there evidence to support chiropractic care of low back pain?
</h1>  July 18, 2007 
<p><strong></strong><em>Welcome to <strong>Class Act</strong>, a new feature 
of Clinical Correlations. Class act will feature posts written by NYU 3rd and 
4th year medical students. These posts will focus on evidenced based answers to 
clinical questions related to patients seen by our students in the clinics or 
on the wards. Prior to publication, each commentary is thoroughly reviewed for 
content by a faculty member. Enjoy&hellip;</em></p> 
<p><strong>Commentary by Brian Liem, MSIV</strong><em><br>
</em></p> 
<p>A 52 year old male with no medical problems presents to your clinic with a 
10 year history of chronic intermittent back pain. Over the past few months, 
his pain has increased in severity and frequency. Radiological examination 
reveals degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, particularly at L4-L5. Would 
the patient benefit from chiropractic intervention?</p> 
<p>Low back pain is the 5th leading reason for medical office visits in the US 
and is the leading cause of work-related disability.1 Fifty-six percent of 
office visits for back pain are to family practitioners and internists, 25 
percent to orthopedic surgeons, 7 percent to neurosurgeons, and 4 percent to 
neurologists, and the rest to chiropractors and other healthcare 
professionals.2 While the standard practice for treating lower back pain is 
generally with activity modification, analgesics and physical therapy, spinal 
manipulative therapy, otherwise known as chiropractic care, has gained 
popularity throughout the years.</p> 
<p>From a chiropractor&rsquo;s perspective, low back pain is a function of 
restricted movement in the spine. In spinal manipulation, practitioners apply 
high velocity manual loading to the spine using short or long leverage methods 
in order to increase spine mobility.3 Many patients with chronic low back pain 
will seek chiropractic care, but what is the evidence that chiropractic care is 
even effective in treating low back pain?</p> 
<p>One randomized control study in UK of 1334 patients compared treatment of 
low back pain with &ldquo;best care&rdquo; in general practice to spinal 
manipulation added to &ldquo;best care.&rdquo; At three months post-treatment, 
those patients who were given the additional spinal manipulation had improved 
Roland Morris disability scores.4 At twelve months there continued to be 
improvements, although less dramatic.</p> 
<p>However, in a meta-analysis of 39 randomized control trials comparing 
spinal manipulation to commonly used, but not necessarily proven, therapies 
(i.e.: analgesics, back school (diathermy), physical therapy, light massage, 
bed rest, topical gels, corsets), spinal manipulative therapy was found only to 
be superior to sham therapy or therapies judged to be ineffective or even 
harmful.5 Researchers found no evidence that spinal manipulation was more 
effective than standard treatments for low back pain.</p> 
<p><br>
 Despite the above meta-analysis findings, patients may still believe 
that they achieve greater relief from chiropractic interventions than from 
standard medical treatment. In a study of 681 low back pain patients at UCLA, 
receiving either chiropractic or medical care, it was found that compared with 
medical care-only patients, chiropractic patients were much more likely to 
perceive improvements in their low back symptoms.6 This study, however, found 
that at 18 months post treatment, there was no statistically significant 
reduction in clinical outcomes, as measured by pain score and disability, 
between the two groups.</p> 
<p>With the literature in mixed support of chiropractic care for low back 
pain, perhaps the question is not whether spinal manipulative therapy is 
effective in treating this condition, but, rather, in which subset of patients 
it is likely to benefit? In a randomized control trial of 131 patients in San 
Antonio, Texas, it was found that patients who received spinal manipulation in 
addition to exercise benefited more than those who received exercise therapy 
alone if they met certain criteria.7 This criteria included: 1) symptoms for 
fewer than 16 days 2) No symptoms distal to the knee 3) At least one 
hypermobile segment in the lumbar spine 3) At least one hip with more than 35 
degrees of internal rotation 4) A score below 10 on the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs 
Questionnaire.</p> 
<p>Taking the above studies together, at this time chiropractic care can be 
considered a safe and moderately effective treatment of low back pain. However 
there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that it achieves better outcomes 
than standard care.</p>

<p>Great article. It didn&rsquo;t seem biased against chiropractic, yet seemed 
to present the facts and research. Kudos.</p>

<p>Good post. There are actually some really good studies that have been 
conducted by British Medical Journal and the Journal of Manipulative and 
Physiologic Therapeutics that have suggested chiropractic therapy was more 
effective with exercises at providing substantial long-term relief. I think 
they are less an 3 years old.</p>

<p>This is a well balanced article, although I am not sure on what the 
conclusion that &ldquo;there is not sufficient evidence that chiropractic 
achieves better outcomes than standard care&rdquo; is based. Is it comparing 
chiropractic billing vs medical billing? Or is it strictly on clinical 
outcomes? Does safety play a factor? Love to see these explored in another post.
