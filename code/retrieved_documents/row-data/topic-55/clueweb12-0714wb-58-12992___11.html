<h2> 4 Quick Tips for better skin! </h2>  Wednesday, March 02, 2011 <br>

<p><br>
 Many of us are misinformed or just plain unaware of our skin's most 
basic needs. For example, you and your friends dress up as KISS for 
Halloween.&nbsp; AWESOME!!&nbsp; Now how do you get all that makeup off? Dish 
soap and a Brillo pad?</p> 
<p>There are important, simple guidelines for &quot;CLEAN&quot; skin. </p> 
<p>1) CLEAN your makeup brushes. This is very important. Not only will it keep 
your brush resilient, but it will prevent bacteria from spreading on the skin. 
If you tend to breakout, this should be done weekly at the very least. Pay 
attention to where your breakouts are. Are they on your cheeks? If your are 
cleaning your brushes, maybe you are using the wrong blush.&nbsp; If you are 
using disposable sponges, try a different sponge.&nbsp; If you are using your 
fingers, make sure your hands are clean before you apply.</p> 
<p>2) CLEAN your skin. DON'T sterilize your skin. Over-cleansing is very bad 
for the skin because it strips away its natural oils. 
&ldquo;Dewy&rdquo;/natural looking skin is healthy and attractive 
looking.&nbsp; If you have very oily skin, use blotting sheets throughout the 
day. Using cleansers that are detergent-like or contain alcohol dry the outer 
layers, damaging the skin. Not only does this make skin look tight and feel 
itchy, but it will force the skin to produce more oil which then gets trapped 
under the dead skin and produces breakouts.</p> 
<p>3) CLEAN your pores. The only efficient and non-damaging way to cleanse 
your pores and get rid of unsightly &quot;blackheads&quot; is by getting 
facials regularly. &quot;Squeezing&quot; at home without exfoliating, heating 
the skin improperly, or using inappropriate tools can lead to permanent 
capillary damage and can permanently stretch the pores. Facials are most 
effective when done every 4-6 weeks.</p> 
<p>4) CLEAN out your cosmetic drawer! Using expired makeup and skin care 
products may not only smell or be ineffective, but some can also damage your 
skin! There are many specific ingredients that will actually damage your skin 
if used after they have been overly oxidized (Vitamin C to name one). 
De-clutter! And ask a professional for suggestions and time frames to keeping 
your products. Chances are if you&rsquo;re not sure&hellip;.your products have 
expired and your skin care routine is probably not very effective. Have your 
skin analyzed and re-stock with the essentials.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;If you have any questions about your skin or skin care products, 
please contact our licensed aesthetician Christiana Santana at
