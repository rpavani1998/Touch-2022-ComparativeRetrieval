<h3>Intramuscular Manual Therapy</h3> 
<p><strong>What is intramuscular manual therapy?</strong> <br>
 Intramuscular 
manual therapy (IMT) is an invasive procedure in which a solid filament needle 
is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point. A 
myofascial trigger point consists of multiple contraction knots, which are 
related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle.</p> 
<p><strong>Is IMT similar to acupuncture?</strong> <br>
 This is not the same 
as acupuncture, an aspect of traditional Chinese medicine, which is based on 
the metaphysical theory of normalizing energy flow in the body. IMT is a 
western medical technique that is based on scientific studies and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>How does IMT work?</strong> <br>
 There are mechanical and 
biochemical effects that occur from IMT. Based on the pioneering studies by Dr. 
Jay Shah and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, we know that 
inserting a needle into trigger points can cause favorable biochemical changes, 
which assist in reducing pain. It is essential to elicit so-called local twitch 
responses, which are spinal cord reflexes. Getting local twitch responses with 
IMT is the first step in breaking the pain cycle.</p> 
<p><strong>What type of problems can be treated with IMT?</strong> <br>
 IMT 
can be used for a variety of musculoskeletal problems. Muscles are thought to 
be a primary contributing factor to the symptoms. Such conditions include, but 
are not limited to neck, back and shoulder pain, arm pain (tennis elbow, carpal 
tunnel, golfer's elbow), headache to include migraines and tension-type 
headaches, jaw pain, buttock pain and leg pain (sciatica, hamstrings strains, 
calf tightness/spasms). The treatment of muscles has the greatest effect on 
reducing pain mechanisms in the nervous system.</p> 
<p><strong>Is the procedure painful?</strong> <br>
 Most patients do not feel 
the insertion of the needle. The local twitch response elicits a very brief 
(less than a second) painful sensation. Some patients describe this as a little 
electrical shock; others feel it more like a cramping sensation. Again, the 
therapeutic response occurs with the elicitation of local twitch responses and 
that is a good and desirable reaction.</p> 
<p><strong>Are the needles sterile?</strong><br>
 Yes, we only use sterile 
disposable needles.</p> 
<p><strong>What side effects can I expect after the treatment?</strong><br>
 
Most patients report being sore after the procedure. The soreness is described 
as muscle soreness over the area treated and into the areas of referred 
symptoms. Typically, the soreness lasts between a few hours and two days.</p> 
<p><strong>What should I do after having the procedure done?</strong><br>
 Our 
recommendations vary depending on the amount of soreness you have and on the 
individual response to the treatment. Recommendations may include applying heat 
or ice over the area, gentle stretches and modifications of activities.</p> 
<p><strong>How long does it take for the procedure to work?</strong> <br>
 
Typically, it takes several visits for a positive reaction to take place. 
Again, we are trying to cause mechanical and biochemical changes without any 
pharmacological means. Therefore, we are looking for a cumulative response to 
achieve a certain threshold after which the pain cycle is disturbed.</p> 
<p><strong>Why is my physician not familiar with IMT?</strong> <br>
 In the 
US, IMT is a relatively new method for treating myofascial pain and not 
everyone is already aware of this effective modality. Feel free to inform your 
doctor about this treatment option. It is upon all of us to educate others 
about new and innovative ways to treat pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Where does IMT fit in the entire rehabilitation program?</strong> 
<br> Generally speaking, IMT is the modality of choice when it comes to 
treating patients in the clinic. More frequently, IMT is needed in the 
beginning in order to break the pain cycle. Once that is achieved, other 
treatment options are introduced.</p> 
<p><strong>Once I am feeling better, how often do I need to come back to 
maintain my progress?</strong><br>
 The musculoskeletal system is under 
constant pressure from gravity, stress, work etc. A regular exercise program 
combined with good posture can prevent many problems. If the pain comes back, 
&quot;tune-ups&quot; are recommended to treat and prevent serious injuries.</p>
