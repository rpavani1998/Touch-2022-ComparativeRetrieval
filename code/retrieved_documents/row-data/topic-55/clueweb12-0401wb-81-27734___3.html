 Physical Therapy Myths <br>

<br> 
<p><strong>Physical therapy</strong> is just for people who have had strokes 
or surgery.<br>
<br>
 This is really is more of a misunderstanding than a myth. 
The scope of<strong>physical </strong><strong>therapy</strong> is broad. The 
profession of<strong>physical therapy</strong> addresses a wide variety of 
conditions: yes strokes and surgeries&hellip; but also<strong>sprains/strains
</strong>, <strong>tendonitis, bursitis, back pain, shoulder pain</strong>, 
<strong>T</strong><strong>MJ, urinary incontinence, headaches, dizziness
</strong>, etc.&nbsp; The concept to understand is that PAIN is just merely a 
symptom&hellip;it is not the problem.&nbsp; Some underlying problem 
(dysfunction) with the human body causes the signaling of pain.<strong> 
Physical therapy</strong> is designed to identify and handle the underlying 
problem so that your pain has no reason to exist.&nbsp; When you handle the 
problem causing the pain, the pain goes away.&nbsp; So if you have pain,<strong>
physical therapy</strong>can help.</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
 Medication controls my pain, so I don&rsquo;t need <strong>
physical therapy</strong>!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 This is a very important myth or 
misunderstanding to address. The first thing that needs to be understood is 
PAIN and the role of PAIN.&nbsp; Pain is a protective mechanism, it simply is a 
&ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;signal&rdquo; that something is wrong.&nbsp; Pain 
prevents us from doing things that we shouldn&rsquo;t, so we don&rsquo;t cause 
more harm to ourselves.&nbsp; Also, PAIN IS CAUSED by an underlying problem, 
but not the problem itself.&nbsp; An common analogy to help us better 
understand this is the problem of a flat tire.&nbsp; Now the symptom of the 
flat tire is no air, but the problem is that there is a hole in the tire.&nbsp; 
You can treat the symptom of the flat tire (no air) all you want, but until you 
fix the problem (the hole) your symptom will continue to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
the fact that you can control your pain with medication can in actuality do you 
more harm for you are &ldquo;numbing&rdquo; your pain signal, and by only 
treating the pain, you allow the problem causing the pain to remain, giving you 
future issues.&nbsp; This leads to many things: frustration, increased costs on 
medication and physician visits, lost time from work, inability to do the 
things you enjoy, etc.&nbsp; Now medication does provide us comfort, so that is 
good!&nbsp; The best scenario is to obtain comfort from your pain by using 
medication while correcting the problem causing the pain; in the end you have 
no pain and no problem.&nbsp;<strong>Physical Therapy</strong> is centered 
around identifying and correcting dysfunctions that cause pain.&nbsp; If you 
are having pain, just know that you don&rsquo;t have to live with it.Contact 
Peak Physical Therapyand get it handled. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Physical 
therapy</strong> and chiropractic treatments can&rsquo;t be done together.<br>

<br> Contrary to belief, this can be one of the most beneficial forms of care; 
why?? For it brings two specialties together.&nbsp; The concept to grasp here 
is...&rdquo;mobilize and stabilize&rdquo;.&nbsp; Chiropractors are known for 
their great manual and manipulation (&ldquo;mobilization&rdquo;) skills of the 
joints, especially the spine.&nbsp;<strong>Physical Therapists</strong>, when 
working in tandem with a chiropractor can then focus intently on the 
&ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; of the spine or joint which involves ensuring that 
the soft tissue that support the joints and spine (tendons/ligaments/muscles) 
are adequately flexible/strong to maintain the proper alignment of the 
joint/spine.&nbsp; Chiropractic patients will find that with the assistance of 
physical therapy they &ldquo;hold&rdquo; there spinal alignment for longer 
periods.<br>
