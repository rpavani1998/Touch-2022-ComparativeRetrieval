<p>Back and neck pain is among the top five reasons for doctor's visits, says 
Dr. Michael Cannon, associate professor of family practice at St. Louis 
University Medical School. This pervasive condition has many root causes, each 
requiring specific treatments. Some patients require physical therapy, some 
require surgery, and others require both.</p> 
<p>And with today's growing emphasis on treatments that are less invasive and 
cost effective, physical therapy is becoming a valid alternative for many.</p> 
<p>Certified physical therapists go through a regimen of training qualifying 
them to safely perform certain rehabilitative treatments with goals of reducing 
pain and regaining function. Much of their work also involves education of the 
patient. Their therapies involve successive movements, each building upon the 
other.</p> 
<h2>How Physical Therapists Work</h2> 
<p>Many types of physical therapy exist. The cornerstones of treatment are 
therapeutic exercise and functional training, notes Andrew Guccione, senior 
vice president for practice and research at the American Physical Therapy 
Association.</p> 
<p>Often this involves a program combining manual technique and also graded 
exercises to increase the range of motion and muscle ability, using weights and 
other devices. Occupational therapy is another emphasis of physical therapy 
engaged to either help repair or lessen the effects of certain back conditions 
that hinder normal activities. Therapy can take place in an outpatient clinic, 
the patient's home, a hospital, the workplace, a wound center, a skilled 
nursing facility, or rehab center. Very often, rehab centers look like 
mini-gymnasiums, only with specialized equipment calibrated to measure progress.
</p> 
<p>Nick Pesce, physical therapist (PT), owner, and administrator of Momentum 
Rehab, describes physical therapy as the science of evaluating, diagnosing, and 
treating patients who have impairments, functional limitations, disabilities or 
changes in health resulting from disease, injury or other causes.</p> 
<p>&quot;PTs use various tests and measures to identify the causes of 
difficulties and to track progress of treatment,&quot; he says. &quot;They use 
physical methods, modalities, and education to alleviate pain and regain 
function.&quot; These include forms of heat, cold, and electrotherapy to help 
alleviate pain, decrease swelling, increase strength, and promote healing. 
Methods include therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, functional training, and 
use of assistive devices and adaptive equipment to increase strength, range of 
motion, endurance, wound healing, and functional independence. Another goal is 
to decrease pain, swelling, and muscle spasms.</p> 
<p>PTs first do a comprehensive evaluation, Pesce explains. &quot;Education is 
a large part of treatment - showing and explaining to the patients what is 
wrong to help them better manage their neck and/or back. We train the patient 
in body mechanics, posture, and activity modification.&quot;</p> 
<p>More specifically, Pesce notes, PTs treat initial pain, inflammation, and 
muscle spasms with heat and cold, electrotherapy, manual therapy (soft tissue 
and spinal mobilizations), and light specific exercise. As pain decreases, they 
focus on regaining range of motion, strength, and endurance, while encouraging 
correct body mechanics and postures. Final stages of back care include 
regaining muscular control and reaction time to help prevent further injury.</p>
<h2>Specialists Work Together to Help the Patient Heal</h2> 
<p>Physical therapists usually work closely with the patient's physician to 
coordinate care. Physical therapy differs from chiropractic or osteopathy, 
Pesce says. &quot;There is much overlap in the care these practitioners 
provide, and the professions are evolving and their approaches are 
changing,&quot; Pesce says. Osteopathy began as a hands-on profession, which 
used soft tissue mobilization and spinal manipulation, but now, doctors of 
osteopathy (DOs) are related to MDs in that they prescribe medicine and have 
many privileges that MDs have. DOs focus on preventive health care and receive 
specialized training in the musculoskeletal system, according to the American 
Osteopathic Association. They emphasize understanding ways an injury or illness 
in one part of the body can affect another part of the body.</p> 
<p>DOs also use their hands to diagnose injuries and illness and encourage the 
body's natural tendency to heal. Using osteopathic manipulative treatment, they 
move muscles and joints with stretching, gentle pressure, and resistance, 
according to the association. Chiropractic clinics traditionally placed an 
emphasis on spinal adjustments, using manipulations of the spine to adjust the 
position of the vertebrae. That would stem from a viewpoint that back pain 
sufferers could have part of their vertebrae out of proper position, placing 
pressure on a nerve.</p> 
<p>&quot;Chiropractic physicians are portal of entry health care providers who 
are specialists in conservative treatment of spine complaints,&quot; says 
Richard Cole of Cole Pain Therapy Group. They use spinal manipulation along 
with rehabilitation and therapeutic modes in their treatment approach, he says, 
and have diagnostic responsibilities. They can refer patients on a case-by-case 
basis to physical therapists and surgeons. Chiropractors also counsel patients 
on lifestyle modification, exercise and diet.</p> 
<p>Cole notes that modern physical therapy also has additional roles in spine 
assessment, prevention and treatment. PTs also uses spinal mobilizations or 
manipulations as a tool, in concert with a physician, with a primary objective 
of regaining motion if a spinal joint is tight. All practitioners often 
emphasize use of specific exercises and education. Some of the hallmarks of 
physical therapy in particular are that it offers active and resistive 
exercise, range of motion and isometric exercises, along with prevention 
programs to avert recurring problems, notes Angie Whitfield, director of 
marketing at Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics.</p> 
<p>&quot;What I find in my practice of physical therapy is that it is the 
educational and therapeutic exercise portion of the treatment has the 
long-lasting effects,&quot; says Susan Pearson, a physical therapist. &quot;I 
recall a quote from one of my educational classes, saying: 'Treat you and I 
will help you today - teach you and I will be helping you tomorrow.'&quot;</p> 
<p>Physical therapists must graduate from an accredited school of physical 
therapy, then pass national boards and be licensed by the state. Today, almost 
all schools are training PTs on at least master's degree levels. The clinical 
doctorate is known as the DPT degree. Physical Therapy Assistants must complete 
a two-year college education program and may work only under the direction and 
supervision of a physical therapist, according to the American Physical Therapy 
Association, another medical organization bound by a code of ethics.</p> 
<p>Nowadays, all credible spine care providers are moving to kindred, though 
specific modes of treatment. The focus of conservative spine care has moved 
from passive care (simple bed rest) to active care.</p> 
<p>&quot;The choice of a therapist can be critical to the successful 
conclusion of a conservative treatment program,&quot; says Mark Temme, director 
and chief therapist of OrthoMemphis Physical Therapy. &quot;Manual skills are 
essential. Be sure to ask your doctor about manual therapy the next time you 
seek care for the neck or back.&quot;</p>
