<p></p> <b>  Comment</b> 
<p>This page is a simple introduction to chiropractic therapies.<br>
 There 
are many websites and books available which can provide you with more detail.
</p>
<p> The different forms of practice of chiropractic is an important 
consideration regarding the choice of and success of the therapy.</p>
<p> The following represent some of the varieties I have used over the past 40 
years in addition to several others I know of which have proven helpful to 
others. The field of chiropractic is one which encourages the practitioner to 
follow a holistic perspective by reason of its emphasis on balancing the 
functions and energies of the body. This has resulted in individuals 
incorporating other modalities into their practice of chiropractic in an 
attempt to extend and stabilize the benefit of the adjustments they offer.</p>
<p> Be aware, that quality of treatment, like in most other healthcare 
practices, depends upon the diagnostic, communication, and treatment skills of 
the practitioner. These vary widely between the different forms and between 
practitioners within a form of therapy. The longevity of the form of practice 
or of the practice of the individual bear little relevancy to effectiveness. 
Some longer duration therapists have continued to learn and perfect their 
skills; others are little different than when they graduated.</p>
<p> Relevancy is of critical importance in your selection of a form of 
chiropractic therapy and your selection of a therapist. What may have worked 
miraculously for a friend may have little benefit for you, as well as the 
opposite. You may have a personality clash with a practitioner who is yet best 
skilled for you and offers the form of treatment which you can most benefit 
from. The reverse may also occur. You may find a practitioner very attuned to 
you on a personal basis, yet, their skills are substandard, or their manner of 
practice is not helpful. It is great when the personality of the practitioner, 
their skill level, and the form of their practice are beneficial to your health 
recovery and maintenance. Don't expect it. Focus on the benefits.</p>
<p> Relevancy also concerns timing.<br>
 The form of chiropractic which is of 
most benefit to you may change over time as you go through different levels of 
recovery. The form of chiropractic available to you may be restricted by 
location, financial resources, or availability. Other forms of therapy may be 
best undertaken, by you, before, during, or after your use of chiropractic.</p>
<p> More complex equipment does not necessarily provide any significantly 
enhanced clinical results, and that's the bottom line.&quot; Therapeutic 
devices can potentially do more harm than good,&quot; says Dr. Fedoryk. 
&quot;If there's an infection, heat may facilitate its spread. With patients 
who have pacemakers, no electrical therapies should be used in the vicinity of 
the heart.<br>
</p>
<p></p> <br>

<p> Chiropractors focus on physical, emotional, and immune irregularities that 
can result from dislocations of spinal structure or restrictions on movement. 
Visual and manual inspection and diagnosis are usually preferred by most 
chiropractors to determine structural and functional problems. Manipulation of 
the spine through twisting and pulling movements is used to correct or prevent 
structural misalignments and so promote normal bodily function. Chiropractic 
&quot;adjustment&quot; usually refers to a variety of manual mechanical 
interventions.</p>
<p> Chiropractors focus on the body's &#147; innate&#148; (inborn, Reptilian) 
strengths and defences to heal itself without the use of drugs or surgery. They 
believe that misaligned vertebrae, referred to as subluxation, can interfere 
with normal body function, through the interruption of nerve communication, and 
if left uncorrected, can result in muscle and/or organ dysfunction, and other 
imbalances.</p>
<p>Chiropractic started as an association 100 years ago, when Harvey Lillard 
heard a &quot;pop&quot; in his neck after which there was a rapid deterioration 
in his hearing. His employer, Daniel David Palmer, a magnetic healer, 
recognized the relationship of spinal displacement and the reduced function of 
the nervous system.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer, D.C. Ph.C., the son of Daniel David Palmer, 
became the marketer, educator and inventor who further developed and publicized 
the science of Chiropractic. His early work and original research in the field 
of Chiropractic is the foundation upon the present day teachings of the 
science. A prolific writer, lecturer and world traveler, he was President of 
the Palmer School of Chiropractic from 1906 until his death in 1961.</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;Universal Intelligence [Spiritual Guidance] has scattered 
everywhere with amazing and beneficent profusion. ... You can get education 
from people educated like yourself for better or for worse. Knowledge comes 
from a superior--and man has no superior in education, but he has a superior in 
knowledge his Innate Intelligence [Reptilian Structure]; and Innate 
Intelligence has a superior in knowledge in Universal Intelligence [Spiritual 
Guidance]. Wisdom is knowledge gained; ripe wisdom is knowledge ripened into 
practicability of practical use.
<p>There are many educated people; there are more educated fools. There are a 
few people who possess knowledge, but there are few people who possess wisdom. 
... &quot;</p> </blockquote> <br>

<p></p> <br>

<p> Here are a few different approaches: </p></b> 
<ul> <b><b> 
<li>  Basic physical realignment of the spine.<br>
 
http://www.chiropractic.org/
<p>All chiropractors are trained in this approach.<br>
 Some use an adjusting 
technique which results in loud cracking sounds.<br>
 For the patient who needs 
to hear or see dramatic indications in order to believe that anything is being 
done, this approach may be beneficial. For others, who may be sensitized to the 
type of sound and paranoid about further injury and pain, these sounds can 
almost be traumatic.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Cold packs or ice may be used independently or alternately with hot packs 
to reduce swelling and tension in the tissues surrounding and supporting the 
vertebrae.</p> 
<p>A number of forms of electrical therapy, including the TENS machine and 
electrical stimulation acupuncture may also be used to stimulate and relax 
nerves and muscles in an attempt to break up spasm frozen tissues which can 
pull vertebrae out of their healthful position and result in nerve pinching 
leading to inflammation and organ dysfunction.</p> 
<p>Hot packs and other heat therapies, as well as other types of therapy that 
increase vasodilation and circulation to facilitate new tissue formation and 
damaged tissue removal may also be used. These promote the deposition and 
formation of collagen and the repair of tissues may also be added. Use of 
Infrared heat accomplishes a similar result.</p> 
<p>Ultrasound therapy uses high-frequency sound waves that can penetrate one 
to four inches, causing vasodilation, increased circulation, and increased 
heat, while promoting collagen synthesis and deposition to form new tissue.</p> 
<p>Traction stretches the spinal muscles and ligaments, decompresses 
compromised or irritated spinal nerve roots, and increases the biomechanical 
function of degenerative spinal and discopathic conditions. &quot;The most 
popular forms of chiropractic-applied traction are cervical intermittent and 
lumbar flexion-distraction techniques,</p> 
<p> Exercises for muscle stretching and strengthening, are frequently 
advocated in order to strengthen muscles supporting connective tissues which 
have been damaged and to provide a balance between opposing muscle groups where 
one has been developed to the disadvantage of another. Stretched tendons and 
ligaments seldom shrink back to their more healthful length so additional 
muscle support is a less invasive and less costly for of correction than 
surgery.</p> 
<p> PNF, or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, involves techniques to 
improve muscle and joint function. The treatment is geared toward treating the 
whole body.</p> 
<p> Therabands and Swiss ball activities, which are very effective in 
rehabilitation, along with other low-tech, inexpensive equipment like 
trampolines, balance boards, and BOSU balls are also advocated by some 
practitioners.</p> 
<p> Exercise tubing [including swimming pool flotation noodles]: <br>
 
Resistive-motion exercise using simple exercise tubes is also available at 
almost any athletic store. Exercise tubing has been shown to offer pain relief 
and improve strength and conditioning for patients recovering from many joint 
injuries. With a couple of sessions' instruction in the chiropractic office, 
the patient can be taught to use exercise tubing for almost any upper - and 
lower - body strengthening exercise. They're portable, simple to use, and don't 
take up nearly as much space as free weights.</p> 
<p> A flat bench, a stationary bike, and Foot Levelers or Synergy wall tubing 
systems and any tabletop or stand-alone upper-body ergometer may also be used 
to assist in particular muscle development for the purpose of greater support 
of the skeletal structure in a balanced manner.</p> </blockquote> <br>
<br>

<p></p></li>
<li> Alignment of the spine and nutritional counseling.<br>
 In addition to 
the above physical orientation chiropractic adjustment AND one or more 
facilitative and remedial therapies, chiropractors have long integrated one of 
several forms of nutritional support approaches.
<p>An old and most common form of nutritional advice is to rationalize what is 
expected to be of benefit to the client as an extension of published research 
associated to the symptoms of the individual. There are extreme difficulties 
and inefficiencies with this approach for it follows the authoritarian 
conservative approach to medicine and health which assumes that all humans are 
clones of one another. Without a consideration of blood and metabolic type, 
gender, age, build, and the often promotional and idiosyncratic misuse of 
statistics, supplements are often prescribed which are inadequate or excessive 
in dosage, unbalanced in association with each other, and often costly and 
useless.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> In the field of nutrition, every week brings new reports of findings which 
extend our awareness about specific food ingredients. Sometimes, new research 
reveals the fallacies of decades old associations or months old 
pseudo-scientific releases. As environmental deterioration becomes pervasive 
and industrial farming persistently exhausts the soils and contaminates our 
crops with thousands of airborne and seeded chemicals --- we increasingly 
require nutritional supplementation just to maintain a previously normal level 
of nutrition. Yet, each of us experiences different levels of stress and cope 
in different degrees and manners with stress. Energies demanded for coping 
create demand for nutrients according to the type of stress. Our nutritional 
requirements are continuously changing.</p>
<p> Muscle testing to determine the most efficient food combinations and 
supplement dosages has been advocated by health professionals since the late 
1970's. Unfortunately, this simple skill cannot be patented and sold and so few 
practitioners make any effort to learn it for their own use as they cannot sell 
it to their clients. Development of the skill also requires a degree of 
patience, persistence, and self-awareness --- which is difficult to encourage 
in a culture focused on aggressive, fast-paced, competitive, materialistic 
obsession. Individualized eating profiles also conflicts with the cultural 
pattern of shared meals in which one combination of foods has been prepared for 
all.</p>
<p> Individualized selection of foods and supplemental nutrients is the only 
way to effectively consume the best balance to recover, maintain, and enhance 
one's health. With foods occupying the significance of medicinal herbs, 
personal preference for selection on the basis of popularity, taste, or cost 
--- often becomes irrelevant. Still, one must make the selections from what is 
available to one and obtainable with the resources at hand. This self-direction 
and self-restraint requires a discerning ability to use muscle testing which 
one can easily and quickly confirm to be accurate and note distorted by the 
desires or fears of one's Ego [Personal values], and SuperEgo [Social values].
<br><br>
</p>
<p> The use of Spiritual Guidance to determine food selection and supplement 
dosages and inclusion is another way to attain efficient and relevant 
nutrition. This requires even more self-direction, self-restraint, awareness, 
persistence, and independence than the use of muscle testing if one is to 
maintain accuracy in results. The benefit is that it can be much more widely 
applied both beyond oneself and beyond the simple questions of nutrition.</p>
<p> Many chiropractors who have augmented their practice with nutritional 
supplements at an earlier time, have now abandoned this to the many health food 
stores and websites which compete for the business and often have staff who may 
be more familiar with some of the newer supplements, studies, and theories. 
Rather than maintaining an expensive and extensive stock of supplements which 
will likely have a low turnover, and thus a high storage cost --- many 
practitioners have abandoned this attempt at increasing the permanence of their 
chiropractic manipulations to the adoption of other modalities.<br>

<li> Gentle alignment of the spine and other bones.<br>
 John McTimoney 
founded the McTimoney method of chiropractic in Banbury, Britain, in 1951.<br>
 
http://www.mctimoney-college.ac.uk/
<p>McTimoney, an adherent of Palmer's holistic view of chiropractic, believed 
that subluxations impair nerve function and affect the correct functioning of 
the body. His approach altered to a &quot;whole body&quot; one. He came to the 
view that although the spine was the primary source of misalignments, or 
subluxations, the other joints of the body could also be put out of alignment 
by everyday stresses and strains, and that, in order to achieve a complete 
realignment, all the joints of the body should be treated -not just the spine. 
McTimoney also treated animals with his technique and is considered to be a 
pioneer in this field.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The same techniques as other chiropractors are used, but in a much more 
gentle way. They favor a technique known as the &quot;toggle-recoil&quot; 
thrust. In this, the practitioner pushes the joint in the desired direction 
with one rapid movement and then releases it. The tendons and ligaments of the 
joint are stretched by the rapid push and their natural elasticity is thought 
to assist the bones to realign as they recoil when released.</p>
<p>McTimoney practitioners examine and treat the entire body in the course of 
each session to ensure correct skeletal alignment. They rarely use X-rays or 
other diagnostic tools, preferring to rely on what they feel with their hands.
</p>
<p>McTimoney Chiropractic is seen as a safer option than ordinary chiropractic 
because of its lighter touch.<br>

<li> Alignment of the spine and energy balancing.<br>
 Bio-Kinetics, 
http://www.biokineticshealth.com
<p>&quot;We as human organisms are a series of interacting multidimensional 
subtle energy systems, and if these energy systems become imbalanced there may 
be resulting pathological symptoms which manifest on the physical, emotional, 
mental and spiritual planes.&quot;<br>
 From introduction by Gabriel Cousens, 
M.D., to<br>
 Vibrational Medicine: New Choices for Healing Ourselves, <br>
 by 
Richard Gerber, M.D.</p>
<p> The Bio-Kinetics procedures were developed over the past thirty-plus years 
by Dr. Lawrence E. Newsum of Rancho Palos Verdes, California. With the help of 
colleague, Dr. Donald Baune, a Chiropractic Neurologist, he was able to compile 
the information explaining how it works, and develop a concise and teachable 
program.</p>
<p>Bio-Kinetics, through a unique and patented process, works to gently 
activate, stimulate and synchronize areas of the brain, nerve system and body 
that are subconsciously reacting to stored stress-memory patterns, causing 
dysfunction and dis-ease.</p>
<p>Bio-Kinetics is based on neuro-physiological insights and discoveries that 
make it possible to release accumulated biological stress, eliminate negative 
stress reactions and correct stored cellular stress memories anywhere in the 
body and mind.</p>
<p>[The manner in which Bio-Kinetics describes &quot;stress reactions&quot; 
and &quot;stress memories&quot; is very similar to how I have found regular 
energy blocks to be my Balancing Therapy, outlined elsewhere on Earthtym.]</p>
<p>The human brain is a complex electro-chemical organ, producing chemicals 
from nerve cell frequencies. Chemical imbalances come from frequency 
imbalances. Stress-memories result in negative frequency imbalances throughout 
the brain/body system that then trigger a cascade of events leading to 
dysfunction and, eventually disease. In this way, stress-reactions cause 
INTERFERENCE with the normal Brain/Body communication system, and cause 
INTERFERENCE with the flow of energy in, around and through the body.<br>
<br>

</p>
<p> Eliminating The Effects Of Stress:<br>
 Discoveries from fields of 
neurology, neuro-physiology, psycho-neuro-immunology, endocrinology and 
chiropractic have revealed insights into how this system works. A healthy body 
comes from a healthy brain, and a healthy brain comes from a healthy, active 
body. The brain needs stimulation from the body to function properly, and the 
body needs proper communication from the brain to function properly. This new 
understanding has made it possible to develop protocols to update the body's 
reaction to stress, re-program the stress response, and re-connect the 
communication pathways between the brain and body.</p>
<p>Bio-Kinetics unique and patented approach finds hidden stress reaction 
patterns, then using the small hand-held New-Stim instrument, mechanically 
stimulates specific neuro-receptor pathways triggering a nerve response into 
the brain that interrupts the abnormal patterns and normalizes the frequencies 
within the brain.</p>
<p> Bio-Kinetics utilizes very specific contact points in the 
atlanto-occipital area as its primary window into the nervous system because 
the distribution of neuro-receptors is the highest in this region, allowing for 
precise brain activation.</p>
<p>With the procedures developed in 2004, Bio-Kinetics can be performed in 3-7 
minutes to clear physical problems (spinal problems, musculo-skeletal problems, 
organ malfunctions, etc.), chemical sensitivities (allergies), emotional stress 
patterns and electromagnetic frequency interference on most people.</p>
<p>[Much of this approach utilizes muscle testing and the use of the point 
impact Stim instrument. As in all forms of chiropractic, it cannot remove 
sources of toxins in the body or toxin buildup from chemicals and heavy metals. 
It can increase the awareness of and discernment of the Reptilian Structure to 
specific parasitic forms, such as viruses and fungi.]<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p></li>
<li> Alignment of the spine and homeopathic treatment. 
<p>The integration of homeopathic and chiropractic can be a very effective 
approach, although it usually is not. This result is neither a reflection of 
the positive contribution possible with either towards enhanced health.</p>
<p> Homeopathy is usually, in my experience, applied by the practitioner 
interviewing the client and then selecting the one remedy which correlates in 
descriptive principle to the symptoms noted. In the reference available to the 
practitioner, both in paper manual form and computer analysis software, the 
description of the person so afflicted as to benefit from a specific remedy can 
be highly defined.</p>
<p> This rational association of two apparent similar facts, symptom and 
description, have a tendency to be incorrect and wasteful. Second and third 
visits may elicit more detail and symptoms and more remedies to apply. If the 
problem is indeed related to a very specific traumatic event, it may be 
resolved by the use of one remedy.</p>
<p> Muscle testing to determine the most efficient remedy and 
strength/quantity of dosages has been advocated by health professionals since 
the late 1970's. Unfortunately, this simple skill cannot be patented and sold 
and so few practitioners make any effort to learn it for their own use as they 
cannot sell it to their clients. Development of the skill also requires a 
degree of patience, persistence, and self-awareness --- which is difficult to 
encourage in a culture focused on aggressive, fast-paced, competitive, 
materialistic obsession. Individualized treatment profiles also conflicts with 
the cultural pattern of formulaic prescribing in which one remedy has been 
prescribed for apparent singular symptoms</p>
<p> Individualized selection of remedies is the only way to effectively 
address what may be one, or a combination of trauma induced patterns, and 
enhance one's health. With remedies occupying an authoritarian predictable 
association to symptoms, an openness to the possibility of multiple influences 
indicating one or more symptoms and one to many remedies simultaneously --- 
often becomes irrelevant to the simplicity seeking rational brain.</p>
<p> This becomes ever more difficult when the reality becomes known that there 
are hundreds of homeopathic remedies which can be ordered in at least 3 
different potencies. The cost of a partial set often ranges to as much or more 
than $10,000. Which client is going to withstand the rigorous muscle testing 
endurance session while perhaps 5 remedies in 3 differing strengths are 
confirmed for choice? Simply easier to guess, by association, and call it 
rational.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> The use of Spiritual Guidance to determine remedy selection and 
strength/quantity of dosages is a way to attain efficient and relevant 
treatment. This requires even more self-direction, self-restraint, awareness, 
persistence, and independence than the use of muscle testing if one is to 
maintain accuracy in results. The benefit is that it can be much more widely 
applied both beyond oneself and beyond the simple questions of a regular 
interview.</p>
<p> Combinations of remedies may be indicated for symptoms being expressed by 
a multiple of influences, of which most are hidden from the consciousness of 
the patient, themselves. If the patient is Not Aware of this relevant 
information, how can they share it? If diagnosis depends upon shared 
information, how can such be possible when that information is either 
unavailable to the patient, or, embarrassing or shameful to the person?<br>
<br>
<br> </p>
<p></p></li>
<li> Alignment of the spine with a focus on one area.<br>
 Upper Cervical, 
http://www.tna-support.org/newlook/uppercervical.htm, or,<br>
NUCCA, or, atlas 
subluxation complex.
<p>The atlas is a single, 2 oz. doughnut-shaped vertebra at the top of the 
spine. Trillions of nerve fibers from the brainstem travel through the small 
opening in atlas and flow down into the spinal column. Because of the smallness 
of the opening and because of the atlas&#146; close proximity to the brain 
stem, if the atlas has moved out of position even one degree, two very serious 
things can result.</p>
<p> The repositioning of the atlas vertebrae is done by hand or by instrument. 
Depending on the doctor&#146;s technique, it feels like a light tap, a brisk 
thrust, or a soft massage at the side of the neck as the atlas is moved 
precisely back into its correct position. It is completely 
&#147;underwhelming.&#148;</p>
<p> This approach is particularly beneficial to the treatment of whiplash and 
other head trauma injuries. There are few young adults, and fewer mature 
persons, who have not experienced accidental, or intentional, physical shock to 
the head or upper back. This may begin as early as a forceps delivery, a 
disciplinary slap to the head, a fall, a punch, wrestling holds or whips, 
sudden vehicle stops, emotional tension from particular forms of fear or 
anxiety, or many other possibilities.</p>
<p> As usual in chiropractic application, the therapist is likely to be 
committed to their form of chiropractic as a panacea for all ills. This 
attitude, allows, or leaves them in a state of profound denial and ignorance 
about more complex forms of illness, like multiple chronic burdens, and 
prevents a more constructive referral to other services when such could prove 
beneficial. One should NOT be surprised at this, for this characteristic 
applies to most practices of healthcare and medicine, whether conventional or 
alternative.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p></li>
<li> Alignment of the spine with acupuncture preparation.<br>
 Some 
chiropractors begin their treatment with the use of acupuncture needles. These 
are placed to reduce the muscle tension and inflammation which usually attends 
subluxated vertebrae and pinched nerves. It is a method which is drug free and 
allows the body to begin correction while the practitioner is adjusting another 
client. This is often used in place of an initial hand massage, TENS 
electro-stimulation, or Thumper mechanical massage. For those who choose this 
direction, they often find it more effective and efficient than the 
alternatives.<br>
<br>
<br>

<li><b> Alignment of the spine with hypnotic enhancement.<br>
 Network 
Chiropractic, http://www.10ac.com/network_chiropractic.htm<br>
 Also known as: 
Network Spinal Analysis (NSA), and the Somato-Respiratory Integration (SRI) 
methodology.
<p>Network chiropractic is an approach that has been developed by Donald 
Epstein, D.C. It extends chiropractic's traditional adjustment techniques and 
works with the body's Reptilian Intelligence. Its uniqueness lies in its use of 
a unified system of 12 techniques with special attention to their timing and 
sequencing. Using light, gentle movements, practitioners adjust each vertebra 
in relationship to the rest of the spine, on the belief that spine protects an 
essential channel of energy and information to the body.</p>
<p> Dr. Epstein's system of Network Spinal Analysis (NSA) integrates points of 
agreement from diverse chiropractic approaches. He observed from clinical 
experience that not all subluxations of the spine are the same. He found two 
types of subluxations: structural (arising from physical stresses), and 
facilitated (arising from emotional stresses).</p>
<p> Network chiropractic combines a variety of chiropractic techniques to 
enable the practitioner to adjust subluxations with the precise amount and type 
of force suggested by clinical findings. This is different from attempting to 
match the vertebra being adjusted to a specific technique. The difference lies 
in the sequence of the adjustments and the networking of the various methods.
</p>
<p> Network chiropractic may be performed on a group of patients, 
simultaneously within a large treatment area in which the positive statements 
of one person encourages the others present to expect a similar positive 
outcome for themselves. In ALL areas of healthcare, where positive expectation 
is encouraged, rather than being allowed to present itself, there is a 
potential for placebo self-healing to occur, in addition to any improvements 
resulting from the applications carried out by the therapist. The true test of 
effectiveness is when a patient experiences dramatic improvement in some area 
of their health, through the process utilized by the therapist, WITHOUT 
statements of expectation being made.</p></b></li></b> </ul>

<p><b> Comment</b><br>
<b>This page almost did not happen.<br>
 The practice 
of chiropractic is very diverse and personalized to the practitioner.</b></p>
<p><b> During the 1950's my parents were progressive in their accessing of 
Alternative healthcare options when conservative approaches failed. That proved 
often enough, successful, such as when I had a severe intestinal parasite 
problem which could neither be effectively diagnosed nor treated by the 
regional General Practitioner/Surgeon. My parents were also receptive to 
therapies which had proven to be successful for others. Some of those were of 
questionable benefit; others were health enhancing.</b></p>
<p><b> Also in the 1950's, we drove 40 miles to see a chiropractor who was 
also an early adopter of nutritional supplements and organic farming and 
produce. As a child, I was unaware of what his profession was, other than some 
form of doctor. The fellow we periodically visited checked our spinal alignment 
and made adjustments as were indicated.<br>
<br>
</b></p>
<p><b> In the mid-1970's, following a lower back injury which resulted in much 
pain unaided by conventional approaches and medications, I returned to 
chiropractic. I was not working in a city. I provided services to clients in a 
territory that was 500 miles wide by 400 miles with few major roads. The local 
chiropractor came to practice in the region one day each week from his city 
clinic. I was out of the office for less than 40 minutes when I was back in 
just as much pain. I paid attention to the movements he made with my back to 
effect the pain relieving adjustment.</b></p>
<p><b> I developed a keen awareness about lifting correctly.<br>
 By the end 
of the 5th treatment, I could usually adjust my back myself. To enable me to 
function and continue working, I fitted out the back of my Chevy Blazer with 
wooden boxes, I could make into a platform. The boxes carried my tools and 
supplies. I could lay on top of the platform they made and make the adjustments 
and/or rest, regardless of the weather conditions outside. I adjusted my back 2 
to 4 times each day. After 20 treatments, and my regular contributions, I was 
pain free.<br>
<br>
</b></p>
<p><b> Several months later, a driver on recreational drugs ran into my car, 
wrote it off, and left me in a coma. When I regained consciousness, I had 
sustained my first severe whiplash. Again, I returned to chiropractic after 
conventional pain medications in huge doses were useless and deep massage and 
ultrasonic heat physiotherapy of minor benefit. I was out of the chiropractic 
office for less than 10 minutes when I was back in just as much pain.</b></p>
<p><b> I paid attention to the movements he made with my neck to effect the 
pain relieving adjustment. By the end of the 3rd treatment, I could usually 
adjust my neck myself. To enable me to function and continue working, I 
adjusted my neck 3 to 9 times each day. What did I have to lose? A week of pain 
and disability and the potential to be laid off or terminated. It took me 7 
years to fully recover, partly by learning better coping skills. Many of these 
are noted on the Earthtym pages.<br>
<br>
</b></p>
<p><b> In the early 1980's, part of my recovery from the chronic neck problems 
and recurring back problems came when I moved into Toronto. Chiropractors could 
only provide treatments several times each week at that time. I was fortunate 
to find 2 chiropractors with different added skills which assisted in my 
mentoring. From the one, I learned Touch-for-Health kinesiology. From the 
other, I learned an early form of Balancing using Bach Remedies and muscle 
testing. For a time, I attended both of them, giving me a total of up to 4 
treatments per week. As the latter assisted in releasing the energy blocks 
supporting the whiplash and lower back injuries, I gradually required fewer and 
fewer treatments.</b></p>
<p><b> By the late 1980's, I was becoming hypersensitive to many things and 
the environmental and physical stresses of my work were resulting in chronic 
pains again. I was fortunate to be able to attend a nearby chiropractor, yet 
the benefits were short lived. This prompted me to find an enhanced health 
region in which I prepared to build a subdivision for professionals affected in 
such ways. With the research I did into materials and Spiritual Guidance, I 
began developing the Balancing Therapy outlined on Earthtym. By using this 
approach and extending it, I found I could release energy blocks AND 
sensitivities. Newfound health did not last long.<br>
<br>
</b></p>
<p><b> In the early 1990's, I was once again struck by another driver such 
that I sustained a second severe whiplash. After the lengthy and frustrating 
legal experience connected with the first, I chose the more positive stress 
approach of a faster settlement and putting the incident behind me. This time, 
I also had the skills to both release energy blocks developed from the 
experience as well as prevent the development of energy blocks as an extension 
of the stresses involved in recovery. With very little chiropractic 
intervention, I recovered a lot in 3 months, and fully in 9 months.</b></p>
<p><b> During the late 1990's and 2000, it proved necessary for me to move my 
residence-office 5 times. Each time, I was largely responsible for lifting and 
carrying to and from a truck or other vehicle several tons of books and 
reference materials packed into stacking crates. In each case, all of the work 
had to be completed within a 24 hour period. For someone with a prior severe 
lower back injury, this was theoretically impossible. Much of the interim times 
were spent in the low physical activity work of planning and providing therapy, 
or otherwise working from a desk, as well as recovering from some form of 
chronic debilitating illness. Most of the time, the use of tension bandages, a 
back support, and a steady pace --- together with Balancing Therapy --- 
resulted in no lingering discomfort nor chiropractic requirement.<br>

<p><b> In 2000, after the multiple movement of my resources and belongings to 
the stairs, down the stairs into a vehicle, from the vehicle into a house and 
down stairs, as well as from a truck up a stairs to a storage platform --- my 
back had sustained too much. With several organ systems dysfunctioning and 
chronic pain, I was back again at a chiropractor's office, with an emergency. 
This time, results were slower as all the muscle involved were often in spasm. 
Together with a keen eye on preventing energy block building, and with a 
resorting to Qi Gong / Acupuncture, the combination with chiropractic lead to a 
resolution after 7 months.</b></p>
<p><b> During 2001/2002, I was fortunate to have my office in a chiropractic 
clinic. The Balancing Therapy I provided enabled individuals with chronic 
problems not resolved by massage therapy, chiropractic, or homeopathy --- to 
dramatically improve in their health, and on a wider scale. The chiropractor 
allowed me to utilize his extensive supply of homeopathics for integration into 
the treatment of a few of my clients with very complex and compelling 
influences on their health. Utilizing standard homeopathic remedies together 
with the Bach Flower Remedies I used for Balancing, proved highly effective and 
delivered near immediate results.</b></p>
<p><b> During 2002, there were minor periods during which I used chiropractic 
services in Australia associated with chronic illness and travelling (moving 
heavy suitcases). In the latter 4 months of the year, chiropractic, balancing, 
and massage services were used to help recover from my third severe whiplash 
injury. Keeping the energy blocks at bay, I fully recovered this time in 3 
months, in spite of major challenges in my work and social life.<br>

</p>
<p><b> During 2003 to 2005, there were a variety of periods during which I 
benefited from chiropractic treatments to help cope with the chronic illnesses 
I was repeatedly challenged with. These chiropractic approaches were by 
different practitioners who used different forms of chiropractic or integrated 
different additional modalities. They ranged from 2 to 8 sessions. Spiritually 
Guided supplements and other therapies were utilized concurrently together with 
the occasional requirement for Balancing with Bach Flower Remedies.</b></p>
<p><b> As is noted in the main article above, there are MANY varieties of 
chiropractic. Not all are suitable for every person and some can be Very 
beneficial to many persons for specific problems. The basic form of 
chiropractic RELIEVES symptoms. Recovery and cure is subject to some of many 
other options, being effectively integrated with the chiropractic, which is why 
so many chiropractors include other modalities in their practice.</b> <br>
