<h2>Chiropractic Research on Back Pain in Adults</h2>  Descriptions and 
findings fromchiropractic research studies on back pain in adults are listed in 
the following table.<br>
 &nbsp; <strong>  Published from October 1996 through 
June 2003 </strong> <strong>Citation</strong> <strong>Description</strong> 
<strong>Findings</strong> <br>
 Assendelft et al., 2003  Meta-analysis of 39 
randomized clinical trials of treatments for<strong>acute or chronic low back 
pain</strong> in adults. The trials compared <strong>spinal manipulation (by 
chiropractors and other healthcare providers)</strong> with another treatment 
or control condition (including no treatment, conventional medical care, 
pain-relieving drugs, physical therapy, exercise, and back school).  Spinal 
manipulation was more effective than sham therapy, but no more or no less 
effective than other treatments. Authors found that the specific profession of 
the manipulators (including chiropractors) did not affect these results.<br>

<br>  Ernst, 2003  General review of the scientific evidence for the 
effectiveness of chiropractic spinal manipulation for<strong>back pain</strong> 
(this review is not limited to low back pain studies).  Author noted there has 
been only one systematic review of chiropractic spinal manipulation exclusively 
(Assendelft et al., 1996) and that, since that study, emerging trial data 
&quot;have not tended to be encouraging. The effectiveness of chiropractic 
spinal manipulation for back pain is thus, at best, uncertain.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Assendelft et al., 1996  Systematic review of eight RCTs of <strong>chiropractic
</strong> for <strong>acute</strong> or <strong>chronic low back pain</strong>. 
 Authors stated that all studies analyzed had serious flaws in design, 
execution, and reporting. Studies could not be pooled to reach statistical 
conclusions because of insufficient data and data quality problems. Authors 
summarized the available data by narrative, concluded they &quot;did not 
provide convincing evidence for the effectiveness of chiropractic for acute or 
chronic low back pain,&quot; and noted that better-executed trials are needed.
