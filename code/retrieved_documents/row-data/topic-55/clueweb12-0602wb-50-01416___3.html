 There are many 
causes of back pain, and unfortunately most adults will experience back pain at 
some point in their lives. &nbsp;The type of pain experienced, as well as the 
duration and severity of the pain, will differ depending on the cause, as well 
as the individual. &nbsp; Although there is no complete cure for most causes of 
back pain, there are definite ways to reduce pain, improve mobility and 
flexibility, and avoid the ill-effects caused by prolonged pain and disability. 
<br>  At NYSM, we offer non-surgical options for effectively and safely 
managing back pain. &nbsp;Dr. Michael Neely is experienced in the treatment of 
back pain and customizes treatment programs with the aim of getting patients 
back to the level of activity and type of lifestyle they are accustomed to 
&ndash; without being sidelined by acute or chronic pain.  We offer a number of 
treatment options to improve or eliminate the effects caused by back pain, no 
matter what the cause. &nbsp;In addition to non-surgical medical treatments 
performed by Dr. Neely, NYSM also offers one of the most effective and proven 
ways to improve back pain &ndash; physical therapy. &nbsp; Supervised exercise 
and strengthening through a comprehensive physical therapy program is one of 
the best ways to control back pain and diminish the effects of any disability 
caused by the pain. &nbsp;Our experienced physical therapy staff works 
one-on-one with patients, providing the greatest chance for a successful 
outcome.  &nbsp;  Surgery should always be a last resort option for the 
treatment of back pain. &nbsp; It carries with it numerous risks, a long 
recovery time, and even the chance that surgery is not successful. 
&nbsp;Chiropractic care is another option, but is not helpful for all people or 
all types of back pain. &nbsp;Even for those that do benefit from chiropractic 
care, repeated trips to the chiropractor are required in order to maintain a 
pain-free state and therefore it is not a good long-term solution. 
&nbsp;Self-management of back pain, on the other hand, is a safe and proven 
long-term approach to controlling the effects of back pain.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
NYSM&rsquo;s approach to treating back pain begins with a thorough medical 
evaluation. &nbsp;We address the cause of the pain, how long it has been going 
on, what makes it better or worse, and how the pain affects the patient&rsquo;s 
daily activities. &nbsp;We also take into account each individual 
patient&rsquo;s goals, limitations and concerns before devising a customized 
treatment plan. &nbsp;We offer a variety of cutting-edge non-surgical treatment 
options to relieve and manage pain. &nbsp;We also devise comprehensive plans 
that allow patients to self-manage their pain, under our initial guidance. 
&nbsp;This provides immediate relief, as well as a long-term approach to living 
a life as free from back pain as possible.  &nbsp;  Some causes of back pain 
that can be treated at NYSM include: 
<ul> 
<li>Arthritis</li> 
<li>Degenerative Disc Disease</li> 
<li>Muscle Spasm</li> 
<li>Nerve Impingement (Radiculopathy)</li> 
<li>Piriformis Syndrome</li> 
<li>Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction</li> 
<li>Sciatica</li> 
<li>Scoliosis</li> 
<li>Spondylolisthesis</li> 
<li>Thoracic or Lumbar Sprain or Strain</li> </ul>  If you have tried any type 
of treatment for back pain, including chiropractic care, and have seen no 
improvement after two weeks, it is time to find another approach that will 
work. &nbsp;At NYSM, we are dedicated to helping our patients diminish or 
eliminate pain, while avoiding surgery. &nbsp;Through a combination of 
cutting-edge treatments, as well as a focus on strengthening the body through a 
structured physical therapy program, we can provide you with the tools you need 
to effectively manage back pain so you can get on with living the life that you 
love.
