<h1>  Welcome to <br>
 Gentry Chiropractic and Physical Therapy Clinic</h1> 
<h1>From its Tucson location, Gentry Chiropractic and Physical Therapy Clinic 
provides physical therapy and chiropratic services for Tucson, East Tucson and 
Central Tucson</h1> 
<h2> Mission</h2> 
<p>Our objective is to provide relief for patients suffering from neck, back, 
and other musculoskeletel disorders, using the most up to date, non-surgical 
treatments in a safe, comfortable and nurturing enviroment.</p> 
<h2>What We Offer</h2> 
<p>Dr. Gentry uniquely offers his combined educations as a physical therapist 
(1973) and chiropractor (1985) as well as clinical experiences in multiple 
hospital settings, outpatient and sports medicine clinics.</p> 
<h2>Goals</h2> 
<p>Dr. Gentry's goal with each patient is to determine what aggravates the 
pain (the source) and to develop a treatment plan focused on providing fast and 
effective treatments and to prevent future occurrences.</p> <br>

<p>&quot;Living with pain can be one of the most difficult things any person 
may have to endure. My goal is to help end this pain and help my patients learn 
how to avoid it in the future. With hands-on therapy, an understanding 
patient-doctor relationship and a thorough patient-education process, I am 
often able to achieve effective and lasting results.&quot;</p> <br>
