<p>Physical therapy is an effective treatment option for whiplash, especially 
when combined with other treatments, such as bracing and medications. In 
whiplash, the soft tissues in your neck are damaged, so a physical therapist 
can work with you to restore proper function and movement of those tissues.</p> 
<p>Physical therapy includes both passive and active treatments. Passive 
treatments help to relax you and your body. They're called passive because you 
don't have to actively participate. Most likely, you're experiencing acute pain 
because of whiplash, so you'll probably start with passive treatments as your 
body heals and/or adjusts to the pain. But the goal of physical therapy is to 
get into active treatments. These are therapeutic exercises that strengthen 
your body so that your spine has better support.</p>

<li><strong>Deep Tissue Massage:</strong> This technique targets muscle 
tension that can develop as a result of whiplash. The therapist uses direct 
pressure and friction to try to release the tension in your soft tissues 
(ligaments, tendons, muscles). This should help them heal faster.</li> 
<li><strong>Hot and Cold Therapies: </strong>By using heat, the physical 
therapist seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood 
flow brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to 
remove waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing.<br>
<br> Cold therapy slows circulation, helping to reduce inflammation, muscle 
spasms, and pain. Your physical therapist will alternate between hot and cold 
therapies.<br>
<br>
 (When you first injure yourself&mdash;either in a car 
accident or in another trauma-inducing event&mdash;you can use this hot and 
cold therapy technique at home. Use ice first to bring down the inflammation, 
and after the first 24 to 48 hours, you can switch between ice and heat. The 
heat will help relax tense muscles, and it will increase circulation to the 
injured area. Increased circulation promotes faster healing. As a reminder, 
never put ice or heat directly on your skin&mdash;wrap it in a towel, for 
example.)</li> 
<li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> By increasing blood circulation, an 
ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, cramping, swelling, stiffness, and pain. 
It does this by sending sound waves deep into your muscle tissues, creating a 
gentle heat that enhances circulation and healing.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Active Treatments for Whiplash </strong><br>
 In the active part of 
physical therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to work on 
your strength and range of motion (how easily your joints move). Your physical 
therapy program is individualized, taking into consideration your health and 
history. Your exercises may not be suitable for another person with whiplash 
and neck pain.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>If needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate 
ergonomic principles into your daily activities. Even after you recover from 
whiplash, this posture work should help you because you'll be able to prevent 
other forms of neck pain that develop from daily living.</p> 
<p>Overall, the goal of physical therapy for whiplash patients is to help 
reduce muscle spasms, increase blood circulation, and promote healing of the 
neck tissues.</p>  Updated on: 12/10/09
