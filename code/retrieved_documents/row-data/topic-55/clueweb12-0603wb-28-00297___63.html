<h3>Background and Methods</h3> 
<p>There are few data on the relative effectiveness and costs of treatments 
for low back pain. We randomly assigned 321 adults with low back pain that 
persisted for seven days after a primary care visit to the McKenzie method of 
physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, or a minimal intervention 
(provision of an educational booklet). Patients with sciatica were excluded. 
Physical therapy or chiropractic manipulation was provided for one month (the 
number of visits was determined by the practitioner but was limited to a 
maximum of nine); patients were followed for a total of two years. The 
bothersomeness of symptoms was measured on an 11-point scale, and the level of 
dysfunction was measured on the 24-point Roland Disability Scale.</p>

<h3>Results</h3> 
<p>After adjustment for base-line differences, the chiropractic group had less 
severe symptoms than the booklet group at four weeks (P=0.02), and there was a 
trend toward less severe symptoms in the physical-therapy group (P=0.06). 
However, these differences were small and not significant after transformations 
of the data to adjust for their non-normal distribution. Differences in the 
extent of dysfunction among the groups were small and approached significance 
only at one year, with greater dysfunction in the booklet group than in the 
other two groups (P=0.05). For all outcomes, there were no significant 
differences between the physical-therapy and chiropractic groups and no 
significant differences among the groups in the numbers of days of reduced 
activity or missed work or in recurrences of back pain. About 75 percent of the 
subjects in the therapy groups rated their care as very good or excellent, as 
compared with about 30 percent of the subjects in the booklet group 
(P&lt;0.001). Over a two-year period, the mean costs of care were $437 for the 
physical-therapy group, $429 for the chiropractic group, and $153 for the 
booklet group.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3> 
<p>For patients with low back pain, the McKenzie method of physical therapy 
and chiropractic manipulation had similar effects and costs, and patients 
receiving these treatments had only marginally better outcomes than those 
receiving the minimal intervention of an educational booklet. Whether the 
limited benefits of these treatments are worth the additional costs is open to 
question.</p>

<p>Back pain is a major health problem because of its high prevalence1,2 and 
costs in terms of health care expenditures3-5 and lost productivity.6 Although 
there are many nonsurgical treatments, there is little evidence that any are 
particularly effective. Systematic reviews have concluded that chiropractic 
spinal manipulation appears to be effective in some subgroups of patients with 
back pain7-9 and this is one of the few treatments recommended in 
clinical-practice guidelines on the care of adults with low back pain in the 
United States.10 The effectiveness of physical therapy for back pain has not 
been well studied, and the results of comparisons of physical therapy with 
chiropractic manipulation have conflicted.11-14 A popular form of physical 
therapy,15 the McKenzie method, has not been rigorously evaluated16 or compared 
with spinal manipulation. We compared the effectiveness and cost of the 
McKenzie method of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and provision 
of an educational booklet for the treatment of low back pain.</p> 
<h3>Methods</h3> 
<h3>Study Sites</h3> 
<p>This study was conducted at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, a 
large staff-model health maintenance organization (HMO) in Washington. Subjects 
were recruited from two Seattle-area primary care clinics between November 1993 
and September 1995. Physical therapy was provided in a facility adjacent to 
these clinics, and spinal manipulation was performed by four chiropractors in 
solo practice. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review 
boards of Group Health Cooperative and the University of Washington, and all 
subjects gave written informed consent.</p> 
<h3>Subjects</h3> 
<p>Patients 20 to 64 years of age who saw their primary care physician for low 
back pain and who still had pain seven days later were eligible for the study. 
Physicians referred potential subjects to a research assistant, who obtained 
consent and collected information on the subjects' history of back pain, 
sociodemographic characteristics, general health, and expectations of 
improvement. General health was evaluated with the general health perceptions 
and mental health subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health 
Survey (SF-36).17,18 The score on each of the subscales ranges from 0 (worst) 
to 100 (best). Subjects were excluded if they had mild or no pain seven days 
after the visit to the physician, a history of back surgery, sciatica, systemic 
or visceral causes of the pain, osteoporosis, a vertebral fracture or 
dislocation, severe neurologic signs, spondylolisthesis, coagulation disorders, 
or a severe concurrent illness. Subjects who had received corticosteroid 
therapy, were pregnant, were involved in claims for compensation or litigation 
because of the back injury, had received physical therapy or chiropractic or 
osteopathic manipulative treatment for their current back pain, or visited 
practitioners other than their primary care physicians were also excluded. Use 
of pain medications was not a reason for exclusion.</p> 
<h3>Randomization</h3> 
<p>After base-line data had been collected, the subjects were randomly 
assigned without stratification to receive physical therapy, chiropractic 
manipulation, or an educational booklet with the use of sealed, opaque 
envelopes. Because a pilot study suggested a trend toward worse outcomes in the 
group that received the booklet, but similar outcomes in the other two groups, 
we allocated 40 percent of subjects to physical therapy, 40 percent to 
chiropractic manipulation, and 20 percent to the educational booklet.</p> 
<h3>Treatments</h3> 
<p>Because Washington laws prohibit physical therapists from performing spinal 
manipulation and chiropractors from using physical therapies such as 
ultrasonography, the clinical practices are distinct.</p> 
<h3>Physical Therapy</h3> 
<p>In the McKenzie approach, patients are placed in one of three broad 
categories (derangement, dysfunction, and postural syndrome) that determine 
therapy.19,20 In this formulation, most back, buttock, and leg pain is thought 
to result from a &ldquo;derangement syndrome,&rdquo; treated by exercises that 
&ldquo;centralize&rdquo; pain from the feet, legs, or buttocks to the lower 
back.21 Patients are taught to perform exercises that centralize their symptoms 
and to avoid movements that peripheralize them. This method relies on 
patient-generated forces and emphasizes self-care.</p> 
<p>Physical therapy was provided by 13 therapists with a median of 14 years of 
experience. McKenzie Institute faculty trained the therapists before the study, 
and all but one therapist passed an advanced McKenzie credentialing 
examination. Subjects received McKenzie's<em>Treat Your Own Back</em> book19 
and a lumbar-support cushion. Therapists were asked to avoid adjuncts such as 
heat, ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, ultrasonography, and 
back classes. The first visit was scheduled within four days after 
randomization, and up to eight more visits were scheduled, at the discretion of 
the therapist, over the ensuing month.</p> 
<h3>Chiropractic Manipulation</h3> 
<p>The most common method of chiropractic manipulation22 was used: a 
short-lever, high-velocity thrust directed specifically at a &ldquo;manipulable 
lesion.&rdquo; This procedure is typically performed with the patient lying on 
his or her side on a segmental table. No other physical treatments were 
permitted. Chiropractors evaluated patients according to their usual procedures 
and were allowed to make the same recommendations about exercise and activity 
restrictions that they usually did. An exercise sheet was used that emphasized 
stretching and strengthening but excluded extension exercises, an important 
part of McKenzie therapy. The HMO gave the chiropractors any radiographs of the 
subjects that were less than three years old. The need for additional 
radiographs was determined by the chiropractor.</p> 
<p>The chiropractors had 6 to 14 years of experience, and one had a master's 
degree in exercise physiology. Two had advanced training in chiropractic 
orthopedics, and one in sports chiropractic. The initial visit was scheduled 
within four days after randomization, and up to eight additional visits were 
scheduled, at the discretion of the chiropractor, over the ensuing month. A 
chiropractor consultant observed the chiropractors at the start and end of the 
study and confirmed their compliance with the treatment protocol.</p> 
<h3>Educational Booklet</h3> 
<p>A minimal-intervention control group received an educational booklet to 
minimize potential disappointment with not receiving a physical treatment. The 
booklet discussed causes of back pain, prognosis, appropriate use of imaging 
studies and specialists, and activities for promoting recovery and preventing 
recurrences. A previous trial found that the use of this booklet as a 
supplement to standard care was not associated with improved outcomes, even 
though subjects considered the booklet useful.23 </p> 
<h3>Outcome Measures</h3> 
<p>Because back pain often recurs, both short-term outcome (1, 4, and 12 
weeks) and long-term outcome (1 to 2 years) were assessed. The assessment of 
short-term outcome focused on the effects of the assigned treatment on 
symptoms, the level of function, and the level of disability; the assessment of 
long-term outcomes focused on recurrences of low back pain and the use of 
back-related health care. At base line and at all follow-up visits, subjects 
rated how &ldquo;bothersome&rdquo; back pain, leg pain, and numbness or 
tingling had been during the preceding 24 hours. An 11-point scale was used in 
which a score of 0 indicated that the symptoms were &ldquo;not at all 
bothersome&rdquo; and a score of 10 that the symptoms were &ldquo;extremely 
bothersome.&rdquo; The score for the most bothersome symptom was used. A 
similar scale has shown substantial construct validity.24 </p> 
<p>A modified24 Roland Disability Scale25,26 was used to measure the patients' 
ability to function. The scores on this scale are based on the answers to 23 
yes&ndash;no questions about daily activities and can range from 0 (none of the 
23 daily activities limited by back pain) to 23 (all 23 activities limited by 
back pain). This instrument is reliable, valid, and sensitive,24,27 and the 
questions are easily administered by telephone.</p> 
<p>Disability was measured with questions from the National Health Interview 
Survey about the number of days spent in bed, spent home from work or school, 
or with reduced activity.28 These questions were modified to refer specifically 
to back-related restrictions.</p> 
<p>The subjects' use of health care for back-related problems was identified 
by a review of encounter forms completed by physical therapists and 
chiropractors, automated data on utilization for HMO-covered services, and 
questionnaires on visits not covered by the HMO. The subjects were asked to 
rate their care for back pain (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor) at 
one and four weeks.</p> 
<h3>Assessment of Outcome</h3> 
<p>Data on outcomes at one and four weeks were collected by telephone; 
subsequent outcomes were assessed by mail with telephone follow-up. 
Interviewers were unaware of the subjects' study assignment; however, after the 
outcomes had been recorded at four weeks, subjects indicated which treatment 
they had been assigned. Those who had received chiropractic or physical therapy 
were asked about their compliance with therapy and the estimated length of 
their visits.</p> 
<h3>Costs of Care</h3> 
<p>The study paid for the costs of the study treatments. Nonstudy treatments 
were covered (within contract limitations) by the subjects' health insurance. 
The subjects typically had office-visit copayments of $5 to $10 and drug 
copayments of $5 per one-month supply of medications. Physical therapy was 
covered for all HMO enrollees on a physician's referral and with a visit 
copayment. About one third of the subjects had coverage for chiropractic 
services, which did not require a physician's referral but did require a 
copayment. The cost of care was determined from the HMO's cost-accounting 
system and reflects the costs to the HMO. Thus, out-of-pocket expenses for 
patients are not included.</p> 
<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3> 
<p>The study was designed to have at least 80 percent power to detect a 
2.5-point difference in the scores on the Roland Disability Scale and a 
1.5-point difference in the scores on the bothersomeness scale for the 
comparison between physical therapy and chiropractic care. These differences 
are consistent with those considered minimally important.24 </p> 
<p>Data were analyzed according to the intention to treat. The Roland 
Disability and bothersomeness-of-symptoms scores were analyzed as continuous 
variables by analysis of covariance after adjustment for base-line values.29 A 
common set of base-line variables predictive of these scores was included in 
all analyses of covariance (age, age squared, SF-36 mental health score, SF-36 
general health perceptions score, previous physical therapy, and subjects' 
expectations of the likelihood of improvement). Because the primary outcomes 
were not normally distributed (i.e., many subjects had substantial symptoms or 
dysfunction), we used a square-root transformation before analysis so that the 
data better met the assumptions of the parametric test.29 </p> 
<p>Nonparametric tests were used to confirm the results of the parametric 
analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, logistic regression was used, with 
adjustment for base-line values whenever available.29 For all comparisons of 
the three treatment groups a P value of 0.05 was considered to indicate 
statistical significance, and Sidak's method for pairwise comparisons was used 
to adjust for multiple comparisons.30 All P values were two-tailed.</p> 
<h3>Results</h3> 
<h3>Recruitment and Follow-up of Patients</h3> 
<p>Of 3800 patients who were potentially eligible for the study, 714 (19 
percent) met the initial inclusion criteria. The most common reasons for 
exclusion were severe concurrent conditions (27 percent), involvement in claims 
for compensation or litigation because of the back injury (20 percent), or 
visits to practitioners other than their primary care physicians (19 percent). 
A total of 493 patients (69 percent) agreed to participate, and 323 remained 
eligible one week later. Two subjects were excluded after randomization (one 
because of a urinary tract infection and one because of pancreatic cancer). 
Thus, 66 were assigned to receive the booklet, 122 to chiropractic, and 133 to 
physical therapy. Between 89 and 96 percent of the subjects responded to each 
of the follow-up questionnaires.</p> 
<h3>Base-Line Characteristics</h3> 
<p>The typical subject was approximately 40 years old, white, well educated, 
and employed (Table 1Table 1Base-Line Characteristics of the Subjects.). The 
mean scores on the SF-36 general health perceptions subscale were above 
national norms (77.1 vs. 71.4),31 but the mean scores on the mental health 
subscale were below national norms (71.2 vs. 76.5). Most subjects had 
previously received treatment for back pain, and about one third had previously 
received physical therapy and one third chiropractic care (some had had both). 
Most subjects had had back pain for less than six weeks, and 59 percent had had 
back pain for less than three weeks.</p> 
<p>There were only a few significant differences in base-line characteristics 
among the treatment groups (Table 1): subjects in the chiropractic group were 
less likely to have used chiropractic services previously, subjects in the 
physical-therapy group had more bothersome symptoms, and subjects in the 
educational-booklet group reported fewer days with restricted activity and 
lower expectations that their condition would improve in a month's time.</p> 
<h3>Study Treatments</h3> 
<p>Ninety-six percent of the subjects in the chiropractic group and 97 percent 
of the subjects in the physical-therapy group visited their assigned provider 
at least once. The mean number of chiropractic visits exceeded the mean number 
of physical-therapy visits by 50 percent (6.9 vs. 4.6, P&lt;0.001). According 
to the subjects' reports, the total amount of time spent with the provider was 
virtually identical in the two groups (about 145 minutes). No important adverse 
effects of treatment were reported in any of the groups.</p> 
<h3>Chiropractic</h3> 
<p>Chiropractors obtained radiographs for 63 percent of the subjects (58 of 
92) who had not undergone radiography at the HMO. The most common diagnoses 
were sprain or strain (about 50 percent of subjects) and facet syndrome (30 
percent). Eighty-two percent of the subjects underwent manipulation at the 
initial visit. All subjects underwent manipulation of the lumbar or lumbosacral 
region (or both). In addition, 54 percent underwent sacral or sacroiliac 
manipulation, 27 percent thoracic manipulation, 12 percent cervical 
manipulation, and 6 percent manipulation of the hip, pelvis, or ischium. 
Sixty-four percent of the subjects underwent manipulation of more than one 
level of the spine. Other treatments included ice packs (20 percent), brief 
localized massage (49 percent), and exercises in the office (41 percent) or at 
home (58 percent).</p> 
<h3>Physical Therapy</h3> 
<p>Ninety-two percent of the subjects were given a diagnosis of 
&ldquo;derangement.&rdquo; At four weeks, 78 percent of the subjects reported 
that they had performed the recommended exercises on at least four of the 
preceding seven days. Most subjects reported regular use of the lumbar roll (71 
percent) and recommended sitting posture (83 percent). Therapists considered 55 
percent of their patients to be complying with recommended exercises.</p> 
<h3>Cost</h3> 
<p>All 66 subjects in the booklet group were mailed a $1 booklet (Table 2Table 
2Mean Costs of the Treatments.). The mean cost of chiropractic treatment was 
$226.08 per subject, 18 percent of which was for radiography. The cost of 
physical therapy averaged $238.54 per subject, with visits to providers 
accounting for 93 percent of the cost.</p> 
<h3>Other Treatments</h3> 
<p>Eighteen percent of the subjects in the booklet group visited a health care 
provider for back pain during the study month, and only 8 percent of the 
subjects in the chiropractic group and 9 percent of those in the 
physical-therapy group visited providers other than those assigned. The 
reported use of exercise was almost identical in the three groups at base line 
(about 57 percent) and one month (about 81 percent). During the month, the 
percentage of subjects who used back-pain medication of any type decreased from 
82 percent to 18 percent in the chiropractic group, from 84 percent to 27 
percent in the physical-therapy group, and from 77 percent to 32 percent in the 
booklet group (P&lt;0.05 for the differences among the groups after adjustment 
for base-line use). Fewer than 2 percent of the subjects reported using 
corsets, braces, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or 
injections.</p> 
<h3>Outcomes</h3> 
<p>Data on primary outcomes are shown in Table 3Table 3Bothersomeness of 
Symptoms and Roland Disability Scores at Base Line, 4 Weeks, and 12 Weeks.. The 
bothersomeness of symptoms differed among the groups at base line (P=0.04) and 
after 4 weeks (P=0.007) and 12 weeks (P=0.02). After adjustment for the 
base-line bothersomeness scores and the prognostic covariates, the differences 
among groups remained significant at 4 weeks (P=0.02) but not at 12 weeks 
(P=0.06) (Figure 1Figure 1Bothersomeness of Symptoms.). Pairwise comparisons 
showed that the chiropractic group had less severe symptoms than the booklet 
group at four weeks (P=0.02), and there was a trend toward less severe symptoms 
in the physical-therapy group (P=0.06). After square-root transformation to 
adjust for the non-normal distribution of the outcome measures, the differences 
among the treatment groups were no longer significant at 4 weeks (P=0.14) or 12 
weeks (P=0.19).</p> 
<p>Differences in the Roland Disability scores among the groups were small and 
approached significance only at one year (P=0.05), with greater dysfunction in 
the booklet group than in the other two groups. Adjustment for the base-line 
Roland Disability score and the other covariates had little effect (Table 3 and 
Figure 2Figure 2Roland Disability Scores.). There were no significant 
differences between groups at one year after square-root transformation 
(P=0.13) or with the use of the nonparametric test (P=0.16). There were few 
interactions between the treatment and the subjects' characteristics, but in 
the booklet group, poorer mental health scores were associated with worse 
outcomes. There were no significant differences among the chiropractors or the 
therapists with respect to their effect on the subjects' symptoms (e.g., P=0.71 
and P=0.22, respectively, at four weeks) or function (e.g., P=0.51 and P=0.30, 
respectively).</p> 
<p>The number of days of back-related disability was similar among the groups. 
In the 11 months after treatment, the percentages of subjects reporting reduced 
activity were similar (36 percent in the booklet group, 33 percent in the 
chiropractic group, and 35 percent in the physical-therapy group; P=0.94) as 
were the percentages who reported the need for bed rest (9 percent, 8 percent, 
and 11 percent, respectively; P=0.81) and the percentages who reported missing 
work (17 percent, 7 percent, and 13 percent, respectively; P=0.28). 
Approximately 50 percent of the subjects in each group reported recurrences at 
one year, and 70 percent reported recurrences during the second year, but there 
were no significant differences among the groups in the percentages who sought 
care for back pain. For example, during the second year, 24 percent of the 
subjects in the booklet group reported visits to any provider for back pain, as 
compared with 29 percent of the subjects in the chiropractic group and 20 
percent of the subjects in the physical-therapy group (P=0.29). Analysis of HMO 
records yielded similar results (data not shown).</p> 
<p>Total costs of care to the HMO for low back pain over a two-year period 
differed by less than 2 percent in the chiropractic and physical-therapy groups 
and were almost three times as high as in the booklet group (Table 4Table 4Mean 
Costs of Care for Low Back Pain over a Two-Year Period.). Although most of the 
higher costs in the chiropractic and physical-therapy groups were attributable 
to the treatments themselves (Table 2 and Table 4), the cost of other HMO 
services for low back pain was also lower in the booklet group than in the 
other two groups.</p> 
<p>At both one and four weeks, about 75 percent of the subjects in the 
physical-therapy and chiropractic groups rated their care as &ldquo;very 
good&rdquo; to &ldquo;excellent,&rdquo; as compared with about 30 percent of 
the subjects in the booklet group (P&lt;0.001). However, about one quarter of 
the subjects in the booklet group failed to answer this question, possibly 
because only 18 percent received care during this period.</p> 
<h3>Discussion</h3> 
<p>For patients with low back pain, we found that physical therapy and 
chiropractic manipulation had similar effects on symptoms, function, 
satisfaction with care, disability, recurrences of back pain, and subsequent 
visits for back pain. Although chiropractic treatment involved more visits than 
physical therapy, the total time spent with either a chiropractor or a physical 
therapist was similar (about 2.5 hours) as was the total cost of the treatments 
($226.08 and $238.54, respectively).</p> 
<p>Among other rigorous studies comparing chiropractic and physical therapy, a 
British study concluded that chiropractic was more beneficial,11,12 whereas a 
Swedish study found no significant differences in outcomes or costs.14 The 
British study found the benefits of chiropractic treatment to be most evident 
among patients who had previously been treated by chiropractors, a group 
presumably favorably inclined toward chiropractic care. Neither study included 
a no-treatment comparison group. A Dutch study found that manual therapy 
(manipulation and mobilization) and physiotherapy (exercise, massage, and 
physical-therapy methods) had similar effects and were superior to continued 
treatment by a general practitioner.32 </p> 
<p>We found that patients who received chiropractic manipulation or physical 
therapy had only marginally better outcomes than those who received only an 
educational booklet. Because only 18 percent of the subjects in the booklet 
group sought additional care during the month after randomization, this group 
was similar in some respects to a no-treatment control group. Although some 
outcomes for the chiropractic and physical-therapy groups were superior to 
those for the booklet group, the differences were small and, after adjustment, 
were significant only for the bothersomeness of symptoms at four weeks and the 
subjects' satisfaction with care at one and four weeks. None of the observed 
differences in symptoms or function exceeded the predefined criteria for 
clinical importance &mdash; that is, a 2.5-point difference in the scores on 
the Roland Disability Scale or a 1.5-point difference in the scores on the 
bothersomeness scale. The difference in the bothersomeness of symptoms was not 
significant after data transformation to compensate for the skewed distribution 
of scores. Thus, although chiropractic manipulation and physical therapy may 
slightly reduce symptoms, their main benefit for patients with low back pain 
appears to be increased satisfaction with care. Because only a small fraction 
of subjects in the booklet group received care during follow-up, their 
responses to questions about satisfaction with care are difficult to interpret.
</p> 
<p>The marginally better outcome of the physical treatments raises the 
possibility that effects were nonspecific. Although nearly all subjects in the 
physical-therapy and chiropractic groups had repeated contact with providers, 
most subjects in the booklet group had none. Patients may find such contact 
satisfying and this may affect their perceptions of symptoms. A positive 
association between the number of treatments (contact with providers) and 
improvement of back-related symptoms has been reported.33 </p> 
<p>We found no significant differences among the groups in recurrences of back 
pain or in the use of services during follow-up. This casts doubt on the 
ability of the self-care&ndash;oriented McKenzie physical therapy to reduce the 
utilization of services. The overall costs of care for back pain were lowest in 
the booklet group, so there was no evidence that the higher initial costs of 
the physical treatments were offset by later savings.</p> 
<p>The relative costs of chiropractic and McKenzie treatments could differ in 
other settings. The number of visits was left to the discretion of providers 
(who were aware that both costs and benefits would be measured), and the 
smaller number of visits to McKenzie therapists (HMO employees) than to 
chiropractors (in private practice) may reflect differences in practice styles.
15 </p> 
<p>The generalizability of this study is limited by the use of a single health 
care system, the use of specific forms of chiropractic and physical therapy, 
the use of one month of therapy, and the exclusion of patients with sciatica. 
The chiropractic manipulative technique was chosen because it was well 
understood and widely practiced. The extent to which McKenzie therapy in this 
study resembled that provided elsewhere is less clear. The McKenzie therapists 
received special training and were among a small number worldwide who had 
passed a certification examination. Thus, it seems unlikely that the 
effectiveness of McKenzie therapists would be greater in other settings.</p> 
<p>Whether the small benefits of these treatments are worth their additional 
costs is open to question. Given the limited benefits and high costs, it seems 
unwise to refer all patients with low back pain for chiropractic or McKenzie 
therapy. Ideally, there would be some way of identifying the subgroups that are 
most likely to benefit from one or both of these therapies, though we were 
unable to identify any predictive characteristics. In any event, these results 
and those of another recent study14 suggest that for low back pain, there are 
no clear advantages of chiropractic manipulation &mdash; in terms of either 
effectiveness or cost &mdash; over physical therapy.</p>
