<h1>Spinal Manipulation Therapy </h1> 
<h2>A Type of Chiropractic Treatment for Back Pain Relief</h2> 
<p>Spinal manipulation, also known as chiropractic adjustment, is the 
application of a single, high velocity thrust to joints in order to gap or move 
the joint very quickly. It is usual practice to get the person receiving the 
manipulation into a position where the joint is already at or near the end of 
its normal range of movement. Therefore a manipulation will often start with 
the health care professional moving the patient into a certain position before 
manipulating. This requires skilful and sympathetic handling.</p> 
<p>Manipulation is performed by several groups of practitioners:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> chiropractors </li> <br>

<li>osteopaths </li> <br>

<li> physiotherapists are also trained in this technique and some use it 
frequently.</li> <br>

<li>Some orthopaedic doctors </li> </ul> 
<h3>How does spinal manipulation work?</h3> 
<p>The aim of spinal manipulation is to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>reduce pain </li> 
<li> relieve muscle spasm </li> 
<li>increase movement of a stiff area and </li> 
<li> normalise movement and function</li> </ul> 
<p> However, there is some controversy about how it actually works.</p> 
<p>The idea that a joint s &lsquo;out of place&rsquo; and needs to be 
&lsquo;put back in&rsquo; is frequently encouraged by some professionals. I 
meet people all the time who have had their back &lsquo;put back in&rsquo;. 
This implies that there is a degree of subluxation or misalignment of the 
joint. This has yet to be definitively proven (1) even though many 
chiropractors base their practice on identifying this subluxation with x-ray 
and then manipulating the joint &lsquo;back in to place&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>It is very likely that spinal manipulation reduces pain as a result of 
changes in the nervous system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Does it give lower back pain relief?</h3> 
<p>Yes, it does seem to. There has been a great deal of controversy about this 
but a large trial undertaken in the UK in 2004 (2) and a newer systematic 
review (3)&nbsp; seem to show that manipulation achieved a small benefit which 
improved to a moderate benefit when combined with lower back pain exercise .</p>
<p>There are some other considerations however, the UK Beam Trial (2) only 
included patients who had had pain for at least a month and excluded patients 
who had attended a pain management programme i.e. chronic lower back pain 
sufferers.</p> 
<p>There is something else to be aware of too. We know that fear of movement 
increases the risk of you becoming disabled from back pain. The UK BEAM trial 
found that fear of movement lessened more with exercise than with spinal 
manipulation which showed only a tiny improvement. So, if you are fearful of 
movement at all, exercise is better for you than manipulation. Otherwise, 
perhaps consider both!</p>

back pain you might like my e-book which has a step approach that shows you how 
you can take control of your back pain and keep living a normal life. Click
