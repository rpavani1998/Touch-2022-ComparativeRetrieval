<h1>Massage Therapy</h1> 
<h3>The Benefits Of Massage</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Alleviate low-back pain and improve range of motion.</li> 
<li>Assist with shorter, easier labor for expectant mothers and shorten 
maternity hospital stays.</li> 
<li>Ease medication dependence.</li> 
<li>Enhance immunity by stimulating lymph flow - the body's natural defense 
system.</li> 
<li>Exercise and stretch weak, tight, or atrophied muscles.</li> 
<li>Help athletes of any level prepare for, and recover from, strenuous 
workouts.</li> 
<li>Improve the condition of the body's largest organ - the skin.</li> 
<li>Increase joint flexibility.</li>

<li>Reduce postsurgery adhesions and swelling.</li> 
<li>Reduce spasms and cramping.</li>

<li>Relieve migraine pain.</li> </ul> 
<p>Experts estimate that upwards of ninety percent of disease is stress 
related. And perhaps nothing ages us faster, internally and externally, than 
high stress. While eliminating anxiety and pressure altogether in this 
fast-paced world may be idealistic, massage can, without a doubt, help manage 
stress. This translates into:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Decreased anxiety.</li> 
<li>Enhanced sleep quality.</li> 
<li>More energy.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Improved concentration.</li> 
<li>Increased circulation.</li> 
<li>Reduced fatigue.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>In response to massage, specific physiological and chemical changes cascade 
throughout the body, with profound effects. Research shows that with massage:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Arthritis sufferers note fewer aches and less stiffness and pain.</li> 
<li>Asthmatic children show better pulmonary function and increased peak 
airflow.</li> 
<li>Burn injury patients report reduced pain, itching, and anxiety.</li> 
<li>High blood pressure patients demonstrate lower diastolic blood pressure, 
anxiety, and stress hormones.</li> 
<li>Premenstrual syndrome sufferers have decreased water retention and 
cramping.</li> 
<li>Preterm infants have improved weight gain.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Increase the Benefits with Frequent Visits</b><br>
 Getting a massage 
can do you a world of good. And getting massage frequently can do even more. 
Taking part in this form of regularly scheduled self-care can play a huge part 
in how healthy you'll be and how youthful you'll remain with each passing year. 
And remember: just because massage feels like a pampering treat doesn't mean it 
is any less therapeutic. Consider massage appointments a necessary piece of 
your health and wellness plan, and work with your practitioner to establish a 
treatment schedule that best meets your needs.</p> 
<p><b>What are the other benefits to receiving regular massage and/or bodywork 
treatments?</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Increases circulation, allowing the body to pump more oxygen and nutrients 
into tissues and vital organs.</li> 
<li>Stimulates the flow of lymph, the body's natural defense system, against 
toxic invaders. For example, in breast cancer patients, massage has been shown 
to increase the cells that fight cancer.</li> 
<li>Increased circulation of blood and lymph systems improves the condition of 
the body's largest organ - the skin.</li> 
<li>Relaxes and softens injured and overused muscles.</li> 
<li>Reduces spasms and cramping.</li> 
<li>Increases joint flexibility.</li> 
<li>Reduces recovery time, helps prepare for strenuous workouts and eliminates 
subsequent pains of the athlete at any level.</li> 
<li>Releases endorphins - the body's natural painkiller - and is being used in 
chronic illness, injury and recovery from surgery to control and relieve pain.
</li> 
<li>Reduces post-surgery adhesions and edema and can be used to reduce and 
realign scar tissue after healing has occurred.</li> 
<li>Improves range-of-motion and decreases discomfort for patients with low 
back pain.</li> 
<li>Relieves pain for migraine sufferers and decreases the need for medication.
</li> 
<li>Provides exercise and stretching for atrophied muscles and reduces 
shortening of the muscles for those with restricted range of motion.</li> 
<li>Assists with shorter labor for expectant mothers, as well as less need for 
medication, less depression and anxiety, and shorter hospital stays.</li> </ul>
