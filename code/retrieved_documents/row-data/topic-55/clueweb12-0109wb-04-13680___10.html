<p>Dear Friend,<br>

How many questions have you already asked yourself 
about back pain? How often have you turned to websites or books only to find 
back pain symptoms to be confusing and even frightening? Are you worried that 
you're not doing enough to protect your back? Wouldn't you feel better if 
someone would just explain back pain treatments in simple terms?<br>
<br>
Maybe 
you've had troubles with back pain in the past, or maybe you already are in 
pain. In either case, your mind is filled with questions about what is 
happening, what you should do, etc. Have you begun to feel like you'd never

things about back pain? Have you been wondering if there was a way that you 
could finally learn more?<br>
<br>

Therapy</strong>&rdquo; is the perfect resource for caring for your back 
&ndash; injured or not. Not only will you learn about how to handle back pain,

&ldquo;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical 
Therapy&rdquo; right now. No matter what kinds of questions you have, I will 
give you the answers you've been looking for.</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
To start things off, we're going to talk about how you can 
diagnose your pain:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>The common symptoms of back and neck pain</strong></li> 
<li>Are you having chronic pain? </li> 
<li>Start a journal </li> 
<li>What is your activity level? <br>
&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>Nearly 80% of all adults will have back pain at some point or another in 
their lives, so you shouldn't feel alone. And with &ldquo;<strong>Everything 
You Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical Therapy</strong>
,&rdquo; you can be certain that you have the facts about getting the right 
care for your specific needs.</p> 
<p>Maybe you've already had back troubles in the past or you're current 
suffering from chronic and unrelenting back pain &ndash; no matter what kind of 
pain you are in and the experiences you've had, I have everything covered in 
one simple book.</p> 
<h4>So, where do we begin? </h4> 
<p>Even if you have no knowledge whatsoever about back pain and health care, 
my eBook is going to guide you through the basics of what you can expect.</p> 
<p><strong><em>You'll learn about:</em></strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Upper back pain</strong> </li> 
<li>Lower back pain </li> 
<li><strong><em>Sciatica </em></strong></li> 
<li>When back pain isn't just back pain</li> </ul> 
<p>But since the back and the neck are interconnected, I'm also going to cover 
the neck area too:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em><strong>The layout of the neck </strong></em></li> 
<li>When neck pain isn't neck pain <br>
&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>When you have this information, you will be able to recognize your symptoms 
and possible causes early on so that you don't have to suffer longer than is 
absolutely necessary.</p> 
<p>The truth is that there is a lot to know when it comes to your back and 
neck. And while some of it might seem scary or overwhelming, taking 
responsibility for your health is the best thing you can do for yourself. In 
&ldquo;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical 
Therapy,&rdquo; you're going to learn about everything that you can expect as 
well as when to turn to your doctor for help.</p> 
<p><strong>Learn about:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Activity causes of back and neck pain </strong></li> 
<li>Injury causes back and neck pain </li> 
<li><strong><em>Ergonomic causes of pain </em></strong></li> 
<li>How doctors test to determine back pain causes</li> </ul> 
<p>With this knowledge, you can make the best decisions for your back pain as 
well as for the treatment of your pain.</p> 
<p>But treating your back pain is really what you want to know, isn't it? In 
&ldquo;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical 
Therapy,&rdquo; you're going to find out the details of what you and your 
doctor may consider as you begin to assess your pain and create a plan for pain 
relief.</p> 
<h4>But there's even more!&nbsp;&nbsp; </h4> 
<p>Since you should learn about all of the possible treatments for back pain 
before you make your final decision, I have covered 10 different treatment 
categories.</p> 
<p>Learn about:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Physical therapy</strong> </li> 
<li>Sports physical therapy </li> 
<li>Physiotherapy/Occupational Therapy </li>

&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>With all of these potential treatments, it's clear to see that your back 
pain isn't something that will have you suffering for long. There are ways to 
treat your pain, so don't worry about suffering anymore.</p> 
<h4>But&hellip;what about when I am on my own? </h4> 
<p>I've never understood why back pain books and guides always talk about what 
your doctor can do for you, but they rarely address how you can care for 
yourself before turning to more drastic treatments. In &ldquo;Everything You 
Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical Therapy,&rdquo; we're 
going to cover some of your most pressing questions about self care:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Medications (both OTC and prescription)<br>
</li> 
<li>Self care tips <br>
</li> 
<li>To rest or not to rest?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>The detail that I go into with these subjects allows you to have a clear 
understanding of what you can expect on your own. And that can help you feel 
less anxious about &lsquo;doing things right.'</p> 
<p>Also, if you order a copy of &ldquo;<strong>Everything You Always Wanted to 
Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical Therapy</strong>,&rdquo; I'm going to 
include a copy ofmy special report, &ldquo;<strong>Tips &amp; Tricks to Prevent 
Back Pain: Advice on How to Get Rid of Back Pain Now and Later.&rdquo;</strong>

<li>Stress reduction tips <br>
&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>There are plenty of ways you can help reduce your own back pain &ndash; as 
well as prevent it from coming back. I've tried to find tips that you don't 
find anywhere else &ndash; and there're all in this special gift to you.</p> 
<p>I just had so many ideas that I couldn't fit them all into <strong>
&ldquo;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Back Pain &amp; Physical

information, I still needed to include this special report.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<h3>Here is an excerpt of the book:</h3> 
<p><br>
<strong>Physical Therapy</strong></p> 
<p><br>
Since much of back pain&nbsp;is caused by a weakening of the muscles, 
getting those muscles back into shape is the best course of action for many 
patients.</p> 
<p>But if <strong>exercise </strong>and activity on your own hasn't helped and 
the back pain keeps coming back, your doctor may prescribe physical therapy for 
you.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical therapists</strong> will help you learn how to move your 
body in a healthy manner, while also strengthening your core to support your 
back. They can work with you in both active and in passive ways to help your 
body regain its health and to lessen pain naturally.</p> 
<p><strong>Active Physical Therapy:</strong> This is the physical therapy that 
most people readily recognize. When you are doing active physical therapy, the 
therapist is either moving your body for you or they are showing you movements 
that they want you to repeat during your session.</p> 
<p>These are designed to work with your injuries and to help strengthen your 
body to prevent future troubles.</p> 
<p>Depending on the severity of your back pain, you may need to go to physical 
therapy several times a week or you might simply go one time a week over the 
course of many months &ndash; it depends on your diagnosis.</p> 
<p>During these sessions you may:</p> 
<p>Stretch </p> 
<p>Do low impact aerobic work </p> 
<p>Strength training </p> 
<p>To most people, this sounds like going to the gym, but under the care of a 
physical therapist, you will be able to have your injury monitored and 
regulated for you as an individual. They will be able to recommend specific 
movements and then create new goals for new movements as you progress.</p> 
<p>Physical therapists will also encourage the patients to practice these 
exercises on their own to continue their progress as well as to continue 
strengthening their backs.</p> 
<p>If you are given a certain set of exercises to do, it's best that you 
follow the regimen exactly and talk to your physical therapist about any 
additional pain that you might feel during the movements.</p>
