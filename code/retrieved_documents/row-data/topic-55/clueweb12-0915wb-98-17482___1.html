<h2>Massage for Low Back Pain</h2>  Wednesday, July 20, 2011 <br>

<p>A recent study proving that massage therapy is effective for lower back 
pain, was featured on NPRs &quot;All Things Considered.&quot;</p> 
<p>Low back pain is very common. It often goes away after several days or 
weeks, but it may last for months or years or periodically recur. The usual 
treatments for low back pain include drugs (painkillers, anti-inflammatory 
drugs, and muscle relaxants), physical therapy, back exercises, and education 
about ways to prevent back injury and deal with back pain. Some people use 
alternative treatments for low back pain, such as chiropractic or massage 
therapy.<br>
<br>
 This study compared the short-term and long-term effects of 
relaxation massage, structural massage, and usual care for people with 
persisting low back pain.<br>
<br>
 The researchers first gathered information 
about the participants' symptoms and how much those symptoms limited their 
daily activities. They then randomly assigned each participant to receive 
relaxation massage, structural massage, or usual medical care without massage. 
Participants assigned to the massage groups got about 1 hour of massage once a 
week for 10 weeks. The researchers remeasured participants' symptoms and 
ability to perform daily activities after completing the 10 massage treatments, 
and then at 6 months and 1 year after starting massage therapy.<br>
<br>
 
Participants who received massage had less pain and were better able to perform 
daily activities after 10 weeks than those who received usual care. The 
benefits of massage lasted for 6 months but were less clear at 1 year, when 
pain and function had improved about equally in all 3 groups. The type of 
massage did not seem to make a difference. Symptoms and ability to perform 
activities improved about the same in the 2 massage groups.<br>
<br>
 (The full 
report is titled &quot;A Comparison of the Effects of 2 Types of Massage and 
Usual Care on Chronic Low Back Pain. A Randomized, Controlled Trial.&quot; It 
is in the 5 July 2011 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine (volume 155, pages 
1-9). The authors are D.C. Cherkin, K.J. Sherman, J. Kahn, R. Wellman, A.J. 
Cook, E. Johnson, J. Erro, K. Delaney, and R.A. Deyo.)</p> Permalink &bull;
