<h1>Physical Therapy Kenmore Square</h1> 
<h4>Joint Ventures Physical Therapy and Fitness opened in May of 2005. This 
Kenmore Square Physical Therapy office was started after Dan Brownridge and 
Dave Larson spent years working as physical therapists in the Boston area.</h4> 
<h2>About Physical Therapy - Kenmore Square</h2> 
<p>Dan and Dave recognized that the therapist-patient relationship needed to 
be the top priority. They wanted all patients to be guaranteed to be seen 
one-on-one by a licensed physical therapist, not an assistant, aide or student. 
They knew that this would result in the best possible skilled care and faster 
functional outcomes.</p> 
<p>Dan and Dave also understood that patients were receiving different advice 
from different professionals. The massage therapist would say something 
different than the personal trainer and the patient was stuck trying to decide 
who to trust. Dan and Dave decided to bring all the practitioners under one 
roof to work together to achieve each individual&rsquo;s goals. The result is 
the truly integrated healthcare experience that is Joint Ventures Physical 
Therapy and Fitness.</p> 
<h2>Physical Therapy - Kenmore Square - Overview</h2> 
<p>Individuals generally consult a Physical Therapist for the management of 
medical problems or other health-related conditions that cause pain, limit the 
ability to move, or limit the performance of functional activities. Physical 
Therapists evaluate individuals, diagnose conditions, and develop plans using 
treatment techniques that promote the ability to move, reduce pain, restore 
function, and prevent disability.</p> 
<p>Whether your condition is neurological or orthopedic, new or old, our aim 
is to work to heal your injury and improve your fitness level to avoid future 
injuries. We accomplish this by using our state-of-the-art rehabilitation and 
fitness equipment, as well as a combination of manual, traditional and sports 
medicine techniques. All of our Kenmore Square physical therapy sessions are 
conducted in a comfortable private room where you can ask as many questions as 
you need to about your condition or treatment. Once you've completed physical 
therapy, we provide a program that you can follow at home, or we can create a 
program for you that can be followed at our fitness center.</p>
