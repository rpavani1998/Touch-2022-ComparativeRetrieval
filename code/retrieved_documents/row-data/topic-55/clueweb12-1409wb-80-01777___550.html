<p>There once was a time when all food was organic and no pesticides were 
used. Health problems were treated with folk wisdom and natural remedies. There 
was no obesity, and people got lots of exercise. And in that time gone by, the 
average life expectancy was &hellip; 35!</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s right. For most of human existence, according to fossil and 
anthropological data, the average human life expectancy was 35 years. As 
recently as 1900, American average life expectancy was only 48. Today, 
advocates of alternative health bemoan the current state of American health, 
the increasing numbers of obese people, the lack of exercise, the use of 
medications, the medicalization of childbirth. Yet life expectancy has never 
been longer, currently 77.7 years in the US.</p> 
<p>Advocates of alternative health have a romanticized and completely 
unrealistic notion of purported benefits of a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; lifestyle. 
Far from being a paradise, it was hell. The difference between an average 
lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and 
increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods 
(including pesticides). Nothing fundamental has changed about human beings. 
They are still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be 
effectively treated. Indeed, some diseases can be completely prevented by 
vaccination.</p> 
<p>So why are advocates of alternative health complaining? They are 
complaining because they long for an imagined past that literally never 
existed. In that sense, alternative health represents a form of fundamentalism. 
Obviously, fundamentalism is about religion and the analogy can only go so far, 
but there are several important characteristics of religious fundamentalism 
that are shared by alternative health advocacy. These include:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The desire to return to a &ldquo;better&rdquo; lifestyle of the past.</li> 
<li>The longing for a mythical past that never actual existed.</li> 
<li>An opposition to modernism (in daily life and in medicine).</li> 
<li>And the belief that anything produced by evolution (or God, if you prefer) 
is surely going to be good.</li> </ul> 
<p>Advocates of alternative health bemoan the incidence of diseases like 
cancer and heart disease without considering that they are primarily diseases 
of old age. That both cancer and heart disease are among the primary causes of 
death today represents a victory, not a defeat. Diseases of old age can become 
primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are 
vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.</p> 
<p>Alternative health as a form of fundamentalism also makes sense in that it 
has an almost religious fervor. It is not about scientific evidence. Indeed, it 
usually ignores scientific evidence entirely. All the existing scientific 
evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out 
false. None of it works, absolutely none of it. That&rsquo;s not surprising 
when you consider that it never worked in times past; advocates of alternative 
health merely pretend that it did, without any regard for historical reality.
</p> 
<p>Alternative health is a belief system, a form of fundamentalism, and like 
most fundamentalisms, it longs for a past never existed. It is not science; it 
has nothing to do with science; and it merely reflects wishful thinking about 
the past while ignoring reality.</p> <br>

<p>Does this criticism of the &lsquo;average lifespan of 100 years ago&rsquo; 
make sense?<br>

<p>My understanding is that the vast majority of that difference in lifespan 
is accounted for by infant mortality and, to a lesser extent, deaths from other 
childhood diseases. (As you mention, obliquely, above.) Once you made it to 
adulthood, life expectancy was basically the same for them as it is for us 
&mdash; most people lived to their seventies, which is why the Bible, for 
example, gives the average life expectancy (in ancient Israel) as 
&ldquo;threescore and ten,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if they be strong, 
fourscore.&rdquo; Not that the authors of Psalm 90 had access to good 
statistics, but the numbers seem to give a good indication of what was 
understood to be a normal lifespan at the time.</p> 
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure the &ldquo;they only lived to 35!!!&rdquo; argument 
is really useful. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with lauding our modern 
accomplishments, but there&rsquo;s also nothing wrong with critiquing some new 
developments as being less conducive to health than things that were done in 
the past.</p> 
<p>And many things are mixed blessings. Modern agriculture &mdash; and 
especially modern agricultural policy &mdash; makes food available cheaply, but 
the cheap stuff is mostly BAD food. We could change that situation, and in the 
process reduce the risk of diseases like diabetes (NOT a disease of old age 
these days).</p> 
<p>So why not look at human evolution as a guide to what kind of food we 
likely evolved to eat, and use that understanding as part of a scientific 
evaluation of nutrition? What&rsquo;s wrong with pointing to our evolutionary 
history as an explanation for why vegetables and lean meat are better for you 
than Twinkies and Froot Loops? The past has a role to play in our understanding 
of the present &mdash; and hence in the shaping of policy.</p> 
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not sure that lifespan alone is the only valid indicator of 
where we&rsquo;re at as a society. You say that the past was &ldquo;hell&rdquo; 
&mdash; is that really true? In all times and all places? You can&rsquo;t 
imagine someone coming from some past &mdash; any past &mdash; looking at 
modern America, and deciding to return to their own time? Really? The past may 
not have been a golden age, but it doesn&rsquo;t follow from that that we have 
nothing to learn from it.</p> 
<p>Is it not possible, and reasonable, to say that human lifespan has been 
greatly increased by childhood vaccination and other useful medical 
interventions, but also that our average lifespan (not to mention happiness) 
could be increased still further if, for example, we tried eating and working 
and living in a manner more in line with our biology? Why are those two things 
contradictory?</p> </li>

<p>Basically he&rsquo;s saying life spans haven&rsquo;t really increased, 
it&rsquo;s just that lots of children used to die. Personally, I think children 
surviving is a pretty good indication that we have a healthier population! Or, 
as Amy says, we are now able to cure or prevent the things that children used 
to die from, something that &lsquo;ancienct wisdom&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>From a completely anthropological point of view &ndash; life expectancy in 
ancient populations isn&rsquo;t worked out from a mean of the whole population, 
it&rsquo;s worked out from the tiny percentage of fossils we find. So the 
majority of skeletons are in their 30s, giving us an average life expectancy 
around 35. I&rsquo;m out of date here, I haven&rsquo;t done anthropology in 
several years, but I doubt the method has changed much.</p> </li>

<p>This is not the first instance in history where we see a strong longing for 
a better, more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; world.</p> 
<p>The Industrial Revolution saw the rise of the romantic movement, in which 
the role of man in Nature was evaluated and strongly criticized and an 
essential ingredient was a strong desire for a way of life that was pure and 
&ldquo;natural.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Quite a number of thinkers &ndash; one of them being Alain Finkielkraut 
&ndash; have argued that the roots for various kinds of fundamentalism lie in 
the idealism of the romantic movement, for example the &ldquo;Volksgeist&rdquo; 
and the &ldquo;gesundes Volksempfinden,&rdquo; important principles of the 
romantic movement in Germany which have inspired national-socialist thinking 
and can still be seen today in various political circles. I consider the 
concept of the &ldquo;mommy instinct&rdquo; as a branch of this tree.</p> 
<p>Ruth Scurr in her book &ldquo;Fatal Purity&rdquo; has written about the 
ideals of the French Revolution, which were inspired considerably by the 
philosophy of proverbial romantic JJ Rousseau and how these ideals could lead 
to a reign of terror.</p> 
<p>Finkielkraut, Scurr and many others have argued convincingly in my opinion 
that fervent idealism, i.e. an intense desire for purity &ndash; be it 
religious or otherwise &ndash; is often paired with with intolerance and 
bigotry and carries the seeds of terror.</p> </li> 
<li> # KGelling <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 5:02 am </em> 
<p>A quick check of the internet for Infant Mortality Rates in the 1800s threw 
up these two figures &ndash; 3/10 infants died before the age of 1 and 50% of 
children died before adulthood. Although appalling, this is probably in line 
with mortality rates in other ape and primate species.</p> 
<p>Medicine&rsquo;s great achievement has been to stop children dying.</p> 
<p>But what was the average lifespan of *those that survived to adulthood*?</p>
<p>A quick &lsquo;back of a fag packet&rsquo; calculation suggests that to 
achieve an overall average of 35, the remaining 5 (of 10) adults had to have 
reached 70 years of age.</p> 
<p>The female menopause, which kicks in at 50, is also evidence that our 
&lsquo;time gone by&rsquo; relatives lived well passed 35.</p> </li> 
<li> # beatis <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 5:06 am </em> 
<p>I have not worded my previous comment accurately enough; I don&rsquo;t mean 
to say that &ldquo;mommy instinct&rdquo; equals national-socialism, but that it 
is part of the way of thinking that consistently overvalues 
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; vs &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;.</p> </li>

<p>This video reminds me of a Monty Python skit but in reverse.<br>
 You know 
the one: &ldquo;What have the Roman&rsquo;s ever done for us&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As long as you take out all the people who died early, people in the 1900s 
lived just as long as we do today.</p> 
<p>Good one. </p> </li> 
<li> # Stroh <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 6:11 am </em> 
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple to disprove the 
modern-medicine-does-us-nothing-good-fallacy even by anecdotal evidence. Simply 
ask yourself: have I ever been seriously ill? If yes, odds are you would 
already be dead if you had lived in the 19th century.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m among those people. I suffered a bad case of mononucleosis when I 
was six years old, bad enough to put me on IV for several days. It took me 
months to recover the lost weight. Would I be alive today without SBM? Perhaps. 
But probably not.</p> 
<p>If you have never ever been seriously sick, then congrats: you might have 
lived on to a ripe old age even in the 1800s. But to extrapolate incredible 
fortune or genetics to the extent that all medicine is futile is incredibly 
shortsighted and selfish. Most of us are not that lucky!</p> </li>

<p>thehandsomecamel:</p> 
<p>&rdquo; Once you made it to adulthood, life expectancy was basically the 
same for them as it is for us &mdash; most people lived to their 
seventies&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Although infant and child mortality is responsible for a very substantial 
proportion of deaths in nature, there is no evidence that most people lived 
into their seventies. Just consider what we know of historical figures. How 
many historical figures (generally the best fed and the most well off people in 
their societies) attained the age of 70?</p> 
<p>Consider that while Presidents Adams and Jefferson lived to an advanced 
age, William Henry Harrison died of pneumonia only 10 days after his 
inauguration. Queen Elizabeth lived into her 60s, but her brother Edward died 
of tuberculosis at the age of 16, her uncle Arthur, the Prince of Wales, died 
in his late teens of an unspecified illness, and her sister Mary died of 
unknown causes in her early 40s. Some of the ancient philosophers lived to old 
age, but Alexander the Great died of an infectious disease at age 33.</p> 
<p>Medical advances have had the greatest impact on disease of childhood, but 
the impact on diseases of adulthood has been substantial. Who dies of 
tuberculosis these days? How about dysentery, smallpox, or even plague?</p> 
<p>Malnutrition was endemic, almost always compromising health. For most of 
human existence, and in some places to this very day, human beings have faced 
periodic severe food shortages, permanently stunting growth and creating 
additional health problems. At the simplest level, very few people were able to 
keep their teeth into middle age, let alone survive that long.</p> 
<p>Hobbes was talking about politics when he wrote that life in the state of 
nature was &ldquo;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&rdquo; but his words 
are equally true of health conditions.</p> </li> 
<li> # Amy Tuteur, MD <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 8:23 am </em> 
<p>thehandsomecamel:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;So why not look at human evolution as a guide to what kind of food 
we likely evolved to eat, and use that understanding as part of a scientific 
evaluation of nutrition?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a naturalistic fallacy. There is no reason to think 
that what we ate was the ideal diet; it was merely the available diet.</p> 
<p>The insights being gained from the field of evolutionary medicine contrast 
dramatically with the evolutionary claims of &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; health 
advocates. It is axiomatic in &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; health that the human 
body represents evolutionary perfection and that if we only hark back to nature 
we will be healthier. Evolutionary medicine, in contrast, recognizes that the 
human body is the result of competing evolutionary pressures and changing 
pressures of natural selection.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the critical driver of evolution, natural selection, does not 
favor perfection or even health; it favors reproductive success and it 
tolerates a massive amount of wastage. The most &ldquo;successful&rdquo; human 
beings in evolutionary terms are those that leave the most offspring, not those 
that live the longest.</p> 
<p>This is what I mean when I refer to &ldquo;longing for a past that never 
existed.&rdquo; It is simply a myth that life in the state of nature was 
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or even tolerable.</p> </li>

<p>Karen Armstrong, who has written extensively on religious fundamentalism, 
has emphasized that religious fundamentalists idealize the past in similar ways 
and consider themselves to be returning to that past. Of course, that past 
never existed.</p> </li>

<p>The post would be strengthened by an examination of the evidence that shows 
ancient life expectancies. The people I know who take this perspective insist 
that life expectancies in hunter/gatherer societies were 100+ years, and that 
while medicine has increased them drastically over the past 100 years, 
that&rsquo;s only partially making up for the horrible health effects of 
civilization.</p> 
<p>When pressed, they can&rsquo;t provide any actual EVIDENCE for that 
proposition, of course. But in my experience the sticking point is precisely 
what was simply asserted without any detailed discussion &ndash; &ldquo;For 
most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the 
average human lifespan was 35 years.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>Great post. This reminds me of a presentation I attended by a dermatology 
resident who was into all natural treatments (not sure how she got into derm). 
She said that using soap daily is unnecessary, claiming that all it does is 
damage our skin. She pointed to our prehistoric ancestors and said that they 
were fine without using soap. She ended her presentation with &ldquo;and how 
was their health different from ours.&rdquo; Expecting everyone to say not 
much, she was a little shocked when I shouted, &ldquo;They died at 30.&rdquo; 
Got a nice laugh from the audience.</p> </li> 
<li> # bluedevilRA <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 9:29 am </em> 
<p>Stroh raises a good point. The problem is, most people don&rsquo;t even 
realize when they receive treatment for life threatening diseases.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the &ldquo;we evolved to eat only what we could hunt and 
gather&rdquo; gambit is a ridiculously romantic portrayal of early humanity. 
Sure, hunting and gathering sounds fun. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to gather food 
with Racquel Welch in 10,000 BC? But unfortunately, that is not reality. 
Reality is starvation, scavenging, and scurvy. As Dr. Tuteur aptly states, we 
evolved to eat what was available. There was no choice involved in the matter.
</p> 
<p>Furthermore, this argument that we evolved to only eat pre-civilization 
food is a complete misunderstanding of evolution. We *evolved* the use of tools 
and the development of agriculture. This has made us fitter as a species. 
Fitness is about the production of successful offspring and the population boom 
in the last 100 years has clearly shown that the evolution of agriculture 
benefited us as a species.</p> 
<p>In fact, the development of agriculture is arguably the greatest 
accomplishment of the human species. It enabled us to create cities and the 
specialization of labor, which subsequently allowed us to to develop modern 
science and medicine.</p> </li>

<p>Amy, citing a royal family of Europe as &ldquo;the most likely to live 
long&rdquo; is probably a bad idea, since they were terribly inbred and had 
many people gunning for their thrones. Medieval medicine being what it was, on 
some level I&rsquo;d rather be a peasant without a doctor than nobility with 
someone who will bleed me repeatedly and make me take gross, unproven remedies.

<p>What a disappointing post in what is overall a wonderful site. When I come 
to SBM, I&rsquo;m used to seeing citation to peer-reviewed research and 
analysis. I&rsquo;m used to a thoughtful consideration of points. Not just 
polemic.</p> 
<p>This point is particularly bad:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be 
accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought 
about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that modern medicine has improved life expectancy, 
particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is an 
unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support. The 
archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in 
average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to 
agriculture (in Crete, for example, average heights for men went from 
5&rsquo;9&Prime; pre-agriculture to 5&rsquo;3&Prime; afterwards).</p> 
<p>Anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of the 
20th century also knows that native African and Asian populations suffered very 
little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, but 
saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the Western 
&ldquo;industrial agricultural&rdquo; diet.</p> 
<p>So it&rsquo;s impossible to state that the difference in life expectancy is 
due to BOTH modern medicine AND industrial agriculture. Not without a study 
that compared groups of people with access to modern medicine, but with one 
living on a traditional diet and the other on a diet of food produced by 
&ldquo;industrial farming methods.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Absent that study, you can have an opinion, but it won&rsquo;t be a 
science-based one.</p> </li> 
<li> # Zoe237 <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 10:08 am </em> 
<p>Actually, the movie Avatar could be used as an example in popular culture. 
Basically, a Native American civilization on another planet are portrayed as 
the good guys, while the evil technology driven armed forces attempts to 
exterminate them. As the highest grossest movie of all time, I think it&rsquo;s 
relevant to where we&rsquo;re at as a culture. Historically speaking, nature 
vs. science is a very interesting push-pull, with people on both extremes. Both 
sides use life expectancy through history as some sort of &ldquo;proof&rdquo; 
for their false cause associations. In essence though, it&rsquo;s kind of like 
nature vs. nurture, or phonics versus whole language.</p> </li> 
<li> # Galadriel <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 10:30 am </em> 
<p>Something I find as an interesting snapshot of the state of health 
pre-modern medicine is to open up Wikipedia to a page on someone I find 
interesting&hellip;then to look at what we know of that person&rsquo;s family. 
This is hardly rigorous nor is it an impeccable source, but it does, I think, 
provide some insight.</p> 
<p>Take, for example, the Bronte sisters. They were 3 out of 6 children. Their 
mother died of cancer, age 38. The two oldest children died of tuberculosis age 
9 and 10. The one brother died of tuberculosis age 31. Emily Bronte died (TB) 
age 30, and so did Anne. But hey, Charlotte lived to be 38! She died during 
pregnancy, either of typhus or a pregnancy-related condition. Their father 
outlived them all, living to the age of 84.</p> 
<p>So sure, yeah. If early childhood illness didn&rsquo;t get you, and early 
adulthood illness didn&rsquo;t get you, and middle age illness didn&rsquo;t get 
you, you certainly could live to a ripe old age.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Fitness is about the production of successful offspring and the 
population boom in the last 100 years has clearly shown that the evolution of 
agriculture benefited us as a species.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I agree that agriculture benefitted us as a species. I would go back even 
further, to the Neolithic revolution, around 10,000 years ago, (if we&rsquo;re 
looking at hunter-gatherer societies versus farming), when population started 
growing exponentially.</p> 
<p>Of course, the advent of agriculture wasn&rsquo;t all good. Smallpox, for 
example, became widespread, and the hunter gatherers (along a few groups were 
farmers, but not of livestock) of North America were decimated by it. Other 
diseases also became more widespread because people lived closer together in 
one spot. Tradeoffs.</p> 
<p>Jared Diamond&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo; talks about some of the 
&ldquo;one with nature&rdquo; myths about traditional societies.</p> 
<p>The National Academy of Scienes series Dr. Novella posted about a few weeks 
ago on evolution has some really cool articles on aging and disease.</p> </li>

<p>While it&rsquo;s certainly true that declining infant mortality and 
conquering of childhood diseases were huge factors in increasing life 
expectancy, adult life expectancy has been increasing as well. For example, 
John Graunt reported on life expectancy in London in the 1500s and 1600s, one 
of the earliest examples of vital statistics. In 1662, he published<em>Natural 
and Political Observations Mentioned in a Following Index and Made Upon the 
Bills of Mortality</em>. In this book, Graunt was the first to attempt to 
construct life tables and mortality tables based on the numbers of births and 
reported deaths in London. As atercentenary tribute stated:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>300 years ago John Graunt, a London draper, published some &ldquo;Natural 
and Political Observations on the Bills of Mortality.&rdquo; These observations 
represent the 1st, as well as an extremely competent attempt, to draw 
scientific conclusions from statistical data. The present study illustrates 
Graunt&rsquo;s careful scientific approach, his ability to extract the essence 
from what by modern standards are distinctly untrustworthy demographic data, 
and his intuitive appreciation of the amount of interpretation his findings 
would tolerate. Based upon ratios and proportions of vital events and 
consideration of the way in which these changed in different circumstances, his 
analysis is amazingly free of major statistical errors. His statistical 
understanding was consideration. He is responsible for the 1st scientific 
estimates of population size, the concept of the life table, the idea of 
statistical association, the 1st studies of time series, and a pioneer attempt 
to draw a representative sample. Graunt&rsquo;s book continued to be worthy of 
reading today, for it laid the foundations of the science of statistics.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>So what did John Graunt find?</p> 
<p>Graunt found that the average life expectancy in London was 27 years, with 
65% of people dying before age 16, the vast majority due to childhood 
infectious diseases, diseases, I note, that have now been largely brought under 
control by vaccines, antibiotics, and advances in medical care. Steve Rappaport 
reports in<em>Worlds Within Worlds: Structures of Life in Sixteenth-Century 
London</em> that, a century earlier in the 1500s, of men who made it to age 25 
to 26, the ages at which most men became full citizens, the average further 
life expectancy was 28 years, meaning that men who made it to adulthood would 
have had about a 50-50 chance of living to be older than 53 or 54. One-tenth 
died by their mid-30s, and only around one-third lived to be older than sixty. 
I&rsquo;m not quoting these statistics for precision, but merely to show that 
life expectancy sucked until fairly recently even for adults. Only about 1/3 of 
people who made it to their 20s made it to age 60, and many fewer still to age 
70 or 80, about 12-15% and 2-3% respectively. (I&rsquo;m guesstimating from 
looking at a graph in the book.) In all fairness, I note that life expectancy 
was significantly higher in the countryside, at least as far as the data we 
have suggest. Still, people who lived to adulthood did not make it to their 70s 
and 80s at anywhere near the rate that they do now.</p> </li>

<p>Scott, &ldquo;But in my experience the sticking point is precisely what was 
simply asserted without any detailed discussion &ndash; &lsquo;For most of 
human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average 
human lifespan was 35 years.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Coming up with solid evidence about what things were like in the past, 
especially evidence that is meaningful to the general public, is very 
difficult. The further back you go the more difficult it becomes. However, 
there is a lot of evidence in our very recent past, even in my experience and 
that of the generation that preceded me, which is very convincing. Some 
examples, my maternal grandparents both died in their 40s in the 1930s, one 
from a stroke probably caused by hypertension, the other from pneumonia. 
Several other relatives died prematurely from TB. I personally remember the 
polio epidemics. Before you start shouting ANECDOTES!!!, I&rsquo;d like to 
point out that I&rsquo;m pretty sure you can find very reliable statistics 
about the number of deaths caused by these diseases in the not so distant past. 
I had breast cancer in 1984. My cousin has had Type 1 diabetes since childhood. 
She is now in he 50s. What do you think would be the odds of our being alive 
today without scientific medicine? How about my dog who has hypothyroidism? 
Want me to go on? I haven&rsquo;t gotten to my cats yet.</p> 
<p>mxh, referring to a dermatologist, &ldquo;She pointed to our prehistoric 
ancestors and said that they were fine without using soap.&rdquo; She gave a 
citation right? From the Prehistoric Journal of Dermatology, maybe? 
Doesn&rsquo;t anybody read anymore? Off the top of my head I can remember 
reading about a young Polish girl deported by the Russians along with many 
other Poles to Siberia during the Second WW where there was no soap, Cambodians 
living without soap and British nurses held prisoners by the Japanese during 
WWII who didn&rsquo;t have any. They weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;just fine&rdquo; and 
neither was their skin. Of course, they also suffered from other things which 
could affect their skin, such as, in some cases malnutrition or just very poor 
diets. While it would take studies to determine, whether or not, or to what 
degree, the lack of soap was responsible for their skin diseases, if I remember 
correctly, all really missed soap and were very happy when it was again 
available. IMO, even that pleasure should account for something that even the 
prehistoric derm should recognize as valuable.</p> 
<p>I think that one of the main reasons that the past is romanticized by so 
many in the general public is because in addition to having no education in 
science, they also lack any in history and they seem to do very little reading. 
In GROWING UP, by Russell Baker, starting on p. 50 he has a few very 
informative pages about life and death in backwoods America in the 1920s before 
scientific medicine reached there. Just one quote from p. 52, &ldquo;In 
Morrisonville death was a common part of life. It came for the young as 
relentlessly as it came for the old. To die antiseptically in a hospital was 
almost unknown. In Morrisonville death still made house calls.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>Alex Knapp, for being so critical of Dr. Tuteur&rsquo;s lack of citations, 
you do a poor job yourself. Please include a citation for us to review the 
Crete archaelogical evidence.</p> 
<p>Further, the ability to accurately diagnose coronary artery disease (which 
is the form of heart disease you seem to be claiming comes from a poor diet) 
was not developed until the late 1950&prime;s or early 1960&prime;s via use of 
cardiac catheterization. We cannot retroactively determine the prevalence of 
CAD from hundreds of years ago.</p> 
<p>However, we know that CAD typically affects men over 60 and women over 65. 
If people died before that age, then of course CAD would be rare. They 
wouldn&rsquo;t reach the age to develop clinically significant occlusions in 
their coronary arteries!</p> 
<p>Diagnostic problems apply to cancer as well. How do you know cancer did not 
exist? We weren&rsquo;t very good at identifying cancer before the development 
of modern medicine.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s true that modern medicine has improved life 
expectancy, particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is 
an unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support. The 
archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in 
average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to 
agriculture (in Crete, for example, average heights for men went from 
5&prime;9&Prime; pre-agriculture to 5&prime;3&Prime; afterwards).&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that 
measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph. Prior to the advent of 
agriculture, human populations were probably measured in the tens of thousands, 
dropping as low as 10,000 individuals during certain times of hardship. In 
contrast, agriculture allowed for a population explosion that has been 
continuing to this day. Medicine has allowed for an acceleration of that 
population explosion.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of 
the 20th century also knows that native African and Asian populations suffered 
very little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, 
but saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the 
Western &ldquo;industrial agricultural&rdquo; diet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Diabetes (type II), cancer and heart disease are predominantly diseases of 
old age. The rise in incidence of these diseases is a sign of SUCCESS, not 
failure. When the average life expectancy is low, the rate of chronic diseases 
of old age is low. When the average life expectancy rises, the incidence of 
diseases of old age rises too. That&rsquo;s hardly a bad thing.</p> 
<p>As for the incidence of cavities, that&rsquo;s a bunch of baloney.</p> </li>

<p>Alex Knapp, &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s impossible to state that the difference in 
life expectancy is due to BOTH modern medicine AND industrial agriculture. Not 
without a study that compared groups of people with access to modern medicine, 
but with one living on a traditional diet and the other on a diet of food 
produced by &lsquo;industrial farming methods.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
 Absent that 
study, you can have an opinion, but it won&rsquo;t be a science-based 
one.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I disagree and think this is an example of the problem of using SBM as 
opposed to EBM to evaluate health interventions. (Yes. I realize that I may not 
correctly understand what is meant by EBM although from a quick glance I 
suspect that it isn&rsquo;t written in stone and that different institutions 
give it different definitions.) If I understand Alex&rsquo;s interpretation of 
SBM, the lack of one very high quality study controlling for all variables, 
means that there is insufficient evidence to draw any reasonable conclusion. 
That is where I disagree. I think there are degrees of evidence which provide 
us with levels of certainty on a continuum with the kind of study he says we 
need at one end and opinion at the other.</p> 
<p>I suspect that there is a lot of evidence that shows that before the 
introduction of &ldquo;modern methods&rdquo; of farming, many people died of 
starvation because enough food could not be produced the old way. (The Irish 
Potato famine comes to mind.) If so, the evidence of all those deaths caused by 
the inability of farmers to feed everyone, is very good evidence that what 
replaced the old method saved, prolonged and improved a great many human lives. 
Additionally, countless hours and labor had to be spent growing food the old 
way prevented people from engaging in other, perhaps more valuable, pursuits.
</p> 
<p>I suspect, but do not know, that Alex and others are concerned about the 
dangers of &ldquo;industrial farming&rdquo;. However, I believe that is another 
topic, one for now and the future, not one to use to measure how science, 
agricultural science and chemistry, benefited past generations.</p> 
<p>Sorry if I&rsquo;m not sounding terribly clear, but it is that kind of 
topic.</p> </li>

<p>Amy,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that 
measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that agriculture was unequivocally bad. I said that it 
wasn&rsquo;t unequivically<i>good</i>. Until the 20th century, humans in 
agricultural societies suffered more malnourishment and health problems than 
humans in agricultural societies. But yes, there were more people in 
agricultural societies. But is mere numbers of people the only measure of 
health?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Medicine has allowed for an acceleration of that population explosion.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t dispute that, either. I think that modern medicine is a 
wonderful thing.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Diabetes (type II), cancer and heart disease are predominantly diseases of 
old age.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>While the indicence of type II diabetes definitely increases with age in 
the United States, I have a hard time describing a disease that impacts 10.8% 
of the population between the ages of 40-59 as a &ldquo;disease of old 
age.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>(see http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/DM/PUBS/statistics/#allages)</p> 
<p>Ditto heart disease, which afflicts 7.7% of people between 44 and 65 in the 
United States. (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5606a2.htm)</p> 
<p>Additionally, the stuides done between native and westernized populations 
in the early 20th century were controlled for age and still found lower 
prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease in those eating a tradtional 
diet vs. a western one.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As for the incidence of cavities, that&rsquo;s a bunch of baloney.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s well documented that the incidence of cavities is lower in 
hunter-gatherer populations vs. agricultural populations. See e.g. Cassidy CM. 
Nutrition and health in agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers: a case study of 
two prehistoric populations. in Nutritional Anthropology. Eds Jerome NW et al.

<blockquote>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s as dangerous to romanticize the present as it is to 
romanticize the past. We should take as much knowledge as we can and study it 
in order to live the best lives we can. To blithely assume that modern life is,
<i>in every respect</i>, superior to life in the past based on life expectancy 
alone is ridiculous. There are trade offs in everything. It may be that aspects 
of life in the past, coupled with modern advancements, would lead to a 
healthier life. But we&rsquo;ll never know it unless we<i>study</i> it instead 
of just automatically assuming that everything we do now is the best way people 
have ever lived.</p> </li>

<p>I think that, given the available evidence, it&rsquo;s more reasonable to 
assume that advances in health are almost solely due to modern medicine and not 
the industrial methods of farming. I say this because modern farming produces 
food that is less nutrient dense and higher in sugar content than existed even 
50 years ago&ndash;to say nothing of extensive medical research in the early 
20th century comparing the heath effects of native vs. western diets. As a 
consequence, I&rsquo;d have to see a highly controlled study that shows the 
superiority of a modern diet, because the observational evidence goes the other 
way.</p> </li>

<p>Okay, but now we&rsquo;re unjustifiably conflating life expectancy with 
population size.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend you read the Cassidy article I cite above, which 
compared the archaeological evidence of two groups of native Americans in the 
same region, of which one was a hunter-gatherer society (referred to as 
&ldquo;Indian Knoll&rdquo;) and the other was agricultural (referred to as 
&ldquo;Hardin Village&rdquo;). Here&rsquo;s the summary of the authors&rsquo; 
findings:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 1. Life expectancies for both sexes at all ages were lower at 
Hardin Village than at Indian Knoll.<br>
 2. Infant mortality was higher at 
Hardin Village.<br>
 3. Iron-deficiency anemia of sufficient duration to cause 
bone changes was absent at Indian Knoll, but present at Hardin Village, where 
50 percent of cases occurred in children under age five.<br>
 4. Growth arrest 
episodes at Indian Knoll were periodic and more often of short duration and 
were possibly due to food shortage in late winter; those at Hardin Village 
occurred randomly and were more often of long duration, probably indicative of 
disease as a causative agent.<br>
 5. More children suffered infections at 
Hardin Village than at Indian Knoll.<br>
 6. The syndrome of periosteal 
inflammation was more common at Hardin Village than at Indian Knoll.<br>
 7. 
Tooth decay was rampant at Hardin Village and led to early abscessing and tooth 
loss; decay was unusual at Indian Knoll and abscessing occurred later in life 
because of severe wear to the teeth. The differences in tooth wear and caries 
rate are very likely attributable to dietary differences between the two groups.
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p>However, it <i>was</i> true that the population of the agricultrual society 
was higher. However, it came at the price of a lower overall quality of health. 
Why can&rsquo;t we learn from that? Why must we blindly disparage &ldquo;the 
past&rdquo; because they had a lower life expectancy? Why doesn&rsquo;t this 
merit more study in a modern nutritional context?</p> 
<blockquote>

<p>Why not? Prior to the invention of writing, people over the age of 40 would 
serve as a repository of knowledge, customs, culture, and stability. This is 
why elders are revered cultures without a written language, and it may well be 
that the survival of that knowledge garners an evolutionary advantage to 
humans. I&rsquo;m not saying this is true, I&rsquo;m saying that given that 
humans are social animals, there may be evolutionary advantages to longer life 
spans beyond mere reproductive age and accordingly it&rsquo;s dangerous to 
write off over 40 as &ldquo;old&rdquo; from an evolutionary perspective. 
Additionally, when comparative studies have been done of people who do not 
follow western diets, the prevalence of diabetes and heart disease is 
diminished even among the elderly compared to those with western diets.</p>

<p>Among social animals, the survival of individuals is dependent on the 
survival of the social group as a whole. Children are helpless for the first 
decade of life, so the survival of genes is dependent on there being a large 
support network to ensure the survival of children, even if their parents die. 
Thus, there&rsquo;s an evolutionary advantage to long-life in humans, because 
pre-writing, the knowledge and experience of the elderly allowed for knowledge 
to be used and passed on to enhance the survival of the group and therefore 
children. Group dynamics also get selected for from an evolutionary 
perspective. (Van Der Waal has some interesting insights from a group of chimps 
where the most aggressive males were killed in an accident, leaving the 
&ldquo;beta males&rdquo; behind to reproduce. The result was a much more 
cooperative, less aggressive social group that ended up having a larger 
population than similar chimpanzee groups because there was less violence among 
the chimps.)</p> </li>

<p>Zoe, I didn&rsquo;t mean to paint the agricultural revolution as one event 
(I was describing all the agricultural revolutions and advancements that have 
occurred in human history). Also, I agree that the spread of disease was an 
unfortunate side effect of the growth of cities, the increase in farm 
production, and the increase in trade.</p> 
<p>I think the EBM vs SBM debate is very relevant here. The theory put forth 
by Alex and others seems to be that H-G&rsquo;s were more fit to survive 
because they lived long and healthy lives. They had fewer diseases compared to 
modern man and were therefore superior.</p> 
<p>I believe this theory is clearly debunked by the growth numbers. 
H-G&rsquo;s struggled to survive. If they had lived long, happy and healthy 
lives their population would have grown. It did not.</p> </li>

<p>There are ways to limit population growth besides having a baby every year 
and letting half of them die (the agricultural model). My understanding is that 
in hunter-gatherer societies it is more typical to have a baby every four 
years. There is no reason to assume that the reason hunter-gatherer groups are 
smaller than traditional agricultural groups is that their death rates are 
higher. (Though that might be the case, it is a hypothesis that has to be 
tested in each group.) They may be using various methods to reduce birth rates 
to keep group size manageable. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a sign of doing 
things wrong. Even with a lower growth rate, human hunter/gatherer societies 
managed to cover most of the planet.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to assume that everything about 
hunter-gather societies was perfect to recognize that it drove most of our 
evolution, and that significant deviations from the lifestyle may need to be 
compensated for &ndash; for instance, through technology. For instance, 
hunter-gatherers tended to get more exercise than cube-farm dwellers. The 
cube-farm dwellers suffer health effects from lack of exercise, so they use 
their agriculture-and-fossil-fuel-enabled technology to build themselves gyms 
and take sulfonylurea drugs.</p> 
<p>Or, hunter-gatherers moved around and didn&rsquo;t have to worry much about 
sewage. Agriculture made cities possible and urbanites spent thousands of years 
suffering from life in various quantities of s*** before flush toilets and 
rotavirus vaccine were invented. In the meantime, life in crowded medieval and 
industrial cities could be quite disgusting and unsanitary, killing babies and 
otherwise-healthy young people. Other animals, such as ants, for instance, can 
live in large communities without having the same s***-related problems that 
humans do. Ants evolved to live in large, stationary communities. Humans did 
not. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m romanticising life as an ant.</p> 
<p>While it&rsquo;s theoretically possible for a particular human community to 
be hunter-gatherers while having access to modern medicine, modern medicine is 
dependent on agriculture and fuel. So that will always be a non-option for 
humans generally. Either we have agriculture and modern medicine and 
technology; agriculture without modern medicine and technology; or 
hunting/gathering without modern medicine and technology.</p> 
<p>The potato famine is not something that was caused by poor agricultural 
practices. It was caused by extremely successful agriculture that supported a 
large (but impoverished) population that could not be supported by anything 
else. In the absence of potatoes, the Irish either had to leave (like good 
hunter-gatherers) or use capital (which they didn&rsquo;t have but the English 
did) to import food.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be facing that again in the coming decades. Fertilizer 
and pesticides are going to become increasingly expensive and our huge 
agriculture-supported human population is going to be scrambling.</p> </li>

 Michael Haines, Colgate

<p>The mortality decline since the late nineteenth century seems to have been 
the result particularly of improvements in public health and sanitation, 
especially better water supplies and sewage disposal. The improving diet, 
clothing, and shelter of the American population over the period since about 
1870 also played a role. Specific medical interventions beyond more general 
environmental public health measures were not statistically important until 
well into the twentieth century</p>

</p> 
<p>The two extreme explanations of child mortality decline are on the one hand 
that the improvements are due to medical science and on the other that they are 
due to general improvements in economic and social conditions</p> 
<p>The first view, giving preeminence to medical advances, was the 
conventional wisdom until the 1950s, but has, since then, been largely 
discredited. As has been seen in the previous section, child mortality fell 
from a number of diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia) in the early part of 
the 20th century for which there was no effective therapy or immunization</p>

<p>Where is your evidence that this is what happened during the transition to

substantially in population without an increase in lifespan. Are you claiming 
that hunter-gather societies contained small numbers of individuals who lived 
to old age but had only a few children, all of whom survived to adulthood?</p>

at least a small core of women not tied down with infant care available to

non-reproductive grandmothers are a prominent feature of the hunter-gatherer 
societies we know today. Otherwise, if you assume that women contribute to a

<p>Anecdote: I attended a meeting yesterday about sensory integration in young

evolution actively tuned children to be in harmony with their pre-civilization 
environment. Today&rsquo;s technology and urbanism undermines this perfect

<p>Karl: Stunted growth: </p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of food restriction to stunt growth. Children 
have a lot of demands on the limited amount of food they can consume: physical 
maturation, exploring, learning, fighting disease, hunting and gathering. They 
grow with what&rsquo;s left over. Assuming malnutrition in agricultural 
societies is what caused people to be shorter is entirely consistent with what 
we know about nutrition and changes in population heights today. For instance, 
all those 3rd-generation east-asian immigrants in North America who are so much 
taller than their grandparents. Or the Dutch army recruits who were conceived 
after the Hunger Winter of 1946 and who were significantly shorter than the 
recruits born earlier and later.</p> 
<p>Agriculture may lead to:<br>
 &mdash; More sewage to deal with, more 
water-borne disease to fight off, therefore less energy available to fuel 
growth even with the same amount of food.<br>
 &mdash; More children per 
mother, leading to earlier weaning of infants and more competition for food 
among children.<br>
 &mdash; More dependence on local crops, so a boom-and-bust 
cycle of feast and famine.<br>
 &mdash; More dependence on grain and less 
consumption of meat.</p> 
<p>Also:<br>
 &mdash; More staying at home, better housing, cleared land and 
fewer (not more) predators.</p> 
<p>Even if agriculture can support more people, it wouldn&rsquo;t be 
surprising if they were smaller, at least in some circumstances. (Pygmies are 
hunter-gatherers. They aren&rsquo;t very big.)</p> 
<p>This is actually a testable hypothesis, so someone with anthropological 
savvy (not me) can probably go and look up the data. In populations with 
nutrition-related growth restriction, men and women are of similar height 
because there is not enough surplus food to fuel a complete male adolescent 
growth spurt. Back in my university days I had a professor who used to talk 
about that phenomenon being quite visible in Newfoundland, where sex 
differences in height in the older generation were less pronounced than in the 
younger generation.</p> 
<p>We also haven&rsquo;t been talking about pastoralists, who are probably the 
healthiest of the preindustrial groups. They&rsquo;re tall, mobile and have 
ready access to animal protein. They can accumulate capital, which offers 
protection against lean times.</p> </li>

<p>Menopause: If I have a baby every four years until I&rsquo;m 45 and then I

they&rsquo;re sixteen?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Your family. Humans are social animals, and even in hunter-gatherer groups, 
children are looked after by more than just their parents. But if you think 
survival is impossible if people die at 45, consider the fact that in societies 
without good access to medical care, the maternal death rate can be as high as 
10%, so clearly there is a fairly significant risk that a child won&rsquo;t 
just become motherless before 16, but may come into the world motherless. Yet 
our species survived. This is because traits do not survive only if they 
guarantee survival. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect; they just have to 
improve the odds.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;grandmother hypothesis&rdquo; has been floated before to explain 
menopause, but while I find it plausible, I am not yet convinced. In any case, 
even if true, it doesn&rsquo;t mean women usually made it past menopause (nor 
does it mean that men did). One potential complicator: men and women both care 
for the children, but although male fertility does decline with age, they 
don&rsquo;t really have any equivalent to menopause. Why? Shouldn&rsquo;t it be 
just as bad to father a child at 75 and guarantee the child will be fatherless 
at 16?</p> 
<p>There may be another reason why menopause developed. It&rsquo;s long been 
known that parental age is associated with the rate of birth defects; as the 
parents get older, so goes the idea, their gamete-production-systems accumulate 
genetic defects, some of which will be fatal to the offspring. For a while, it 
was held that autism was associated with advanced maternal *and* paternal age, 
but interestingly, a newer study has largely exonerated the fathers; it&rsquo;s 
advanced *maternal* age, not paternal, that is associated with an increase. 
It&rsquo;s not yet certain that this is causal, but it has me wondering: is 
menopause adaptive from the perspective of reducing birth defects?</p> 
<p>(Mind you, the two explanations are not mutually exclusive.)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve rambled a bit here, but my point is that you can&rsquo;t point 
to menopause as evidence that people were generally healthy five thousand years 
ago. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that people *were* generally as healthy 
then as they are today, as long as they didn&rsquo;t have any serious 
accidents, get seriously ill, eat spoiled food, drink tainted water, get 
snakebit, die in childbirth, get in infection, be unfortunate enough to have a 
congenital defect, etc. Like most species, we cope with our premature death 
rate by having enough babies to make up the difference, but it&rsquo;s probably 
fair to say our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring 
illness or accident or famine. Our modern life expectancy *is* higher than that 
(reaching 80 is not considered extraordinary anymore &mdash; 90 is the new 80, 
you might say), but not 35 years higher.</p> </li>

the role of agiculture in evolution and population growth and life expectancy, 
so there&rsquo;s no shortage of evidence.</p> 
<p>I do agree with Dr. Tuteur that there is no evolutionary advantages to 
having people live past reproductive age.</p> 
<p>Alison, I also have read that hunter-gatherers cannot carry their children 
long distances, so they tend to have less of them (due to lactational 
ammenorhea, assuming). A transition to urban areas and close quarters made 
possible by agriculture most certainly INCREASED population at first, but lead 
to decreased life expectancy. All of Dr. Tuteur&rsquo;s points apply to post 
neolithic societies.</p> 
<p>The diseases of hunter gatherer societies DON&rsquo;T tend to be influenza, 
tuberculosis, smallpox, but things like chagas disease.</p> 
<p>There are some skeptic authors (like Michael Shermer) who like to see the 
EBM approach applied to areas such as history. Obviously there are no RCTs, so 
the subject of this blog post is different than the usual.</p> 
<p>I agree with whoever said that it&rsquo;s ALSO dangerous to romanticize the 
present. Before modern sanitation, agriculture most likely lead to increased 
population, but decreased life expectancy.</p> </li>

<p>Amy on menopause:</p> 
<p><i>&ldquo;Ova degrade in quality over the course of a woman&rsquo;s life 
making the risk of giving birth to a child with a severe genetic defect (like 
Down&rsquo;s Syndrome) increasingly common, particularly over age 40. Since 
children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is 
associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to 
wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>If a living mother has no value, it makes no difference whether her 
children are at higher risk of Down syndrome. It only makes sense to reduce 
childbearing to spare her life if her life has value to the population beyond 
the infants she can produce.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Like most species, we cope with our premature death rate by having 
enough babies to make up the difference, but it&rsquo;s probably fair to say 
our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring illness or 
accident or famine. Our modern life expectancy *is* higher than that (reaching 
80 is not considered extraordinary anymore &mdash; 90 is the new 80, you might 
say), but not 35 years higher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy, </p> 
<p>Since you offered: </p> 
<p>1. Your basic premise is that life expectancy has increased from 35 to 77 
due to modern medicine and agricultural advances. Although I don&rsquo;t doubt 
this, you give no evidence. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s haziness in your 
assertion that &ldquo;for most of human existence&rdquo; the life expectancy 
was 35 years.. How far back does that go? How reliable are the indicators we 
use to determine that value?</p> 
<p>2. Regarding life &lsquo;back then&rsquo;, you state &ldquo;It was 
hell&rdquo;. Again, likely true because life has always been a battle of 
survival. Evidence? Presumably there were some pretty decent parts then as 
there are now.</p> 
<p>3. The most flagrant of your assertions, somewhat mitigated by 
Harriet&rsquo;s comment with which you agreed:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;All the existing scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad 
claims of alternative health are flat out false. None of it works, absolutely 
none of it&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As this is a blanket, absolute statement, a single example to the contrary 
will suffice. Laser therapy for chronic neck pain (Ia Evidence).</p>

laser therapy in the management of neck pain: a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of randomised placebo or active-treatment controlled trials.

<p>Medicine and reality are not worlds of absolutes (at least to our current 
state of understanding). The more black-and-white the opinion, the more I slot 
it into the &ldquo;fundamentalist&rdquo; or &ldquo;religious fervor&rdquo;

<p><b>In fact, when life is hard, the new young wife is often not at all keen 
on looking after another woman&rsquo;s children. Think of all the Evil 
Stepmother stories from preindustrial Europe. There seems to be an atavistic 
response that survives today. My sister was taken into care by the 
children&rsquo;s aid because it was feared that her stepmother would kill her 
and her older sister. Sure, that&rsquo;s unusual and extreme, but stepmothers 
are unreliable.</b></p> 
<p>But for every extreme and rare case there are those situations where 
children were raised by their father&rsquo;s second (or sometimes third) wives.
</p> 
<p>I can point to my own famiy history where my grandmother has an older 
half-sister, my great grandfather&rsquo;s first wife died, he remarried to my 
great grandmother and she raised her stepdaughter and her own children.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also a great-great-great (I think I&rsquo;ve got that right) 
uncle who had 17 children by three different wives. His second and third wives 
were actually younger than the oldest children.</p> 
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also the fact that at least one grandparent of mine and 
both parents were raised with their cousins when the cousins&rsquo; parents 
either died or were unable to afford to care for them. In one case a great aunt 
died of pnemounia when she went to care of her sister who was dying of breast 
cancer. As a result all of those children (I believe about eight) were sent to 
live with various relatives, I don&rsquo;t think any of the siblings ever lived 
together after that.</p> 
<p>This doesnt&rsquo; cover what happens when a father dies, in the case of 
one of my grandfathers when his father died his older sister married at the age 
of 14 and he and his younger sister were sent to &ldquo;schools&rdquo; because 
their mother had no money and no desire to try and care for them.</p> </li>

<p>Amy on parents: </p> 
<p><i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the evidence that parental longevity leads to 
increased child survival? How does a support network prevent perinatal death, 
infectious disease and starvation in time of famine?&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Ooh, I really wish I could go to the McGill Medical library right now and 
look it up. (Which I have in the past.)</p> 
<p>In times of war and famine, children who are with their mothers are less 
vulnerable to malnutrition than are children who are with aunts, grandmothers, 
fathers, stepmothers or some random stranger. Mothers will go further to save a 
baby&rsquo;s life than anyone else will.</p> 
<p>You can challenge me and I will be helpless before you, but this was part 
of my senior thesis. (Back in the eighties. There might be better work done 
now, which I would be glad to hear of.)</p> 
<p>From a slightly different angle: One sociological study of an agricultural 
village looked at all kinds of variables upside down and sideways &mdash; 
family size, father&rsquo;s family size, mother&rsquo;s family size, size of 
land available to family, distribution of land, quality of land &mdash; to find 
variables that would identify children at risk of malnutrition. In that village 
the only variable they could find was whether the mother had a cash income or 
not. If she had income she could buy snacks for her children and they would eat 
twice a day. If a mother didn&rsquo;t have her own income, her children 
breakfasted on leftovers from supper &mdash; and that was it until they were 
old enough to stay up and eat supper with the grownups and get two meals a day. 
Agriculture is a lot of work, and food preparation is a lot of work, and there 
just isn&rsquo;t the availability to provide children with food all through the 
day.</p> </li>

<p>In fact, I accepted the statement, &ldquo;All else being equal, stunted 
growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.&rdquo; as fact for the sake 
of argument since its factualness is not relevant to my point.</p> 
<p>My point was that Alex Knapp provided no support for the implied claim that 
reduced average height in the population of the scenario he presented was a 
result of stunted growth in the same thread in which he criticized Amy for not

<p><i>Surely it&rsquo;s the other way round? Earlier weaning of infants leads

<p>One of the means a society can use to space births is a taboo against sex 
for lactating women which may be a two to four year period. In agricultural 
societies the taboo is typically shorter, less stringent, and may even be 
absent.</p> 
<p>Hunter-gatherer children don&rsquo;t eat porrige, so they often can&rsquo;t 
be weaned as young as agricultural children. Not weaning them delays 
mothers&rsquo; return to ovulation, absolutely. (However, we all know examples 
of the imperfection of this method!) If everyone knows they *must* not be 
weaned then the extended lactation period will be actively protected. (Even to 
the extreme of infanticide of a child born before the older child is ready to 
be weaned.)</p> </li>

<p>Heh &mdash; I was menstruating two months after childbirth, both times, and 
I breastfed both my kids for over a year. It definitely is not reliable as a 
form of birth control.</p> 
<p>There is no reason to kill a child because a new child has been born while 
the first is still nursing; women can generally support two babies, milk-wise, 
and by then the older child is not exclusively drinking breastmilk. (If they 
did, they&rsquo;d be malnourished; you really do need to start solids prior to 
age 2. Even the Muslims, who as an article of religious doctrine, are expected 
to nurse for two years, will introduce solids by six months. There is, after 
all, nothing saying it has to be the only source of nutrition.) I am doubtful 
that this happened very often even in ancient hunter-gatherer societies, 
especially given the paleontological evidence even in Homo erectus of taking 
care of seriously disabled tribe/clan members, and, more notably, the fact that 
it isn&rsquo;t common in modern hunter-gatherer societies (what few still 
exist).</p> </li>

Desjardins, H&eacute;ctor P&eacute;rez Brignoli P31 (Google Books)</p> 
<p>&hellip;one must remember that smallpox had begun to diminish before 
vaccination. In Sweden smallpox mortality declined by close to half between 
1770 and 1800.</p> 
<p>&hellip;in England the disease was in decline before the end of the 
century, as was the case in Geneva.</p>

<p>Besides for smallpox to live up to its reputation as the speckled monster, 
we&rsquo;d need to return the squalorous conditions plaguing the people of the 
17 and 1800s.</p> 
<p>As to temporal declines occurring after vaccination remember correlation 
does not equal causation</p> 
<p>Finally this is not to say vaccination, when practiced properly with actual 
vaccine, did not work or have an impact, simply that, as a major cause of

<p>thehandsomecamel on pre-industrial life expectancy:<br>
<i>&ldquo;Once you 
made it to adulthood, life expectancy was basically the same for them as it is 
for us &mdash; most people lived to their seventies, which is why the Bible, 
for example, gives the average life expectancy (in ancient Israel) as 
&ldquo;threescore and ten,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if they be strong, 
fourscore.&rdquo; &rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Israelites were pastoralists. Very clean, very well-nourished. I&rsquo;m 
not surprised they thought 70 was a normal lifespan.</p> 
<p>David Gorski on pre-industrial life expectancy:<br>
<i>&ldquo;Only about 
1/3 of people who made it to their 20s made it to age 60, and many fewer still 
to age 70 or 80, about 12-15% and 2-3% respectively. (I&rsquo;m guesstimating 
from looking at a graph in the book.)&rdquo;</i> </p> 
<p>This is seventeenth-century London, a filthy place! If 12% of adult 
Londoners were able to survive to 70, I&rsquo;m impressed. Really.</p> 
<p>David Gorski on pre-industrial life expectancy:<br>
<i>&ldquo;In all 
fairness, I note that life expectancy was significantly higher in the 
countryside, at least as far as the data we have suggest.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Right, so outside of urban areas, which have their own urban ills, people 
did much better. And most people did *not* live in cities in the 16th and 17th 
centuries.</p> 
<p>These are three very different modes of life, none of which are 
hunter-gatherer. The past is a big place.</p> 
<p>Amy Tuteur on *all* modes of pre-industrial life:<br>
<i>&ldquo;Far from 
being a paradise, it was hell.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Maybe, maybe not. For some people, clearly yes. For others, clearly no. 
Kind of like living in a modern industrial city is hell for some people (life 
expectancy of 57 for DC African-American men) and very nice for some people, 
thank you very much (life expectancy of 92 for affluent Asian-Americans).</p> 
<p>If you want to talk about what is good or bad about something, you need to 
be able to clearly define what the<i>something</i> is. Once you do that, 
you&rsquo;ll probably find both upsides and downsides. (17th century London? 
Sounds awful to me, but people moved there because they liked it. At least some 
people apparently thought the risk of disease was worth it.)</p> </li> 
<li> # Alison Cummins <em>on 18 Feb 2010 at 4:02 pm </em> 
<p>Plonit on infanticide:<br>
<i>&ldquo;There is no reason to kill a child 
because a new child has been born while the first is still nursing; women can 
generally support two babies, milk-wise, and by then the older child is not 
exclusively drinking breastmilk. &hellip; I am doubtful that this happened very 
often even in ancient hunter-gatherer societies.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re right that it probably didn&rsquo;t happen very often. It 
depends on the alternatives to breastmilk.</p> 
<p>Agriculturalists have access to grain. Grains supply approximately 2-4% of 
their calories as protein and 1-4% of calories as fat. Legumes are even higher 
in fat and protein.</p> 
<p>Agriculturalists often have access to milk; pastoralists definitely do. </p>
<p>Hunters and gatherers don&rsquo;t eat much grain. They eat leaves, roots, 
fruits, tubers, nuts and meat. If you don&rsquo;t have nuts where you live, the 
plant material available for your baby is low-protein and low caloric density. 
Bananas are the highest-protein fruit at about 2% of calories. With a little 
supplementation, an adult can live on bananas. A baby can&rsquo;t. A baby with 
this range of plant food choices needs substantial meat or breastfeeding for 
the first 30 months, otherwise they are at high risk of kwashiorkor.</p> 
<p>In a traditional lifestyle, some people really do face horrible choices. In 
these circumstances the taboo against sex with a lactating woman is very strong.

<p>Point of clarification (sorry if I missed this earlier)</p> 
<p>Lifespan is the maximum age an individual may live<br>
 Life expectancy is 
the average age a population lives.</p> 
<p>Amy meant &ldquo;life expectancy&rdquo; in the article &ndash; not 
lifespan. These two terms have then been used interchangeably in the comments.
</p> 
<p>So &ndash; human lifespan has actually not changed much. But life 
expectancy has increased &ndash; for every age group. If you are 40 now your 
life expectancy is greater than if you were 40 in 1800. This is not explained 
by decreased infant mortality.</p> 
<p>But it is true that decreasing infant mortality has had a disproportionate 
effect on life expectancy, since saving one child may add 70-80 years to their 
life.</p> 
<p>However, as someone pointed out, do you know anyone who is literally alive 
due to modern medicine?</p>

<p>But Steven, the naturalists insist those diseases didn&rsquo;t exist in

will probably counter that, yes, today we are getting better at finding ways of 
living longer with our unnatural, unhealthy lifestyles.</p>

<p>re: malnutrition and height, please see the Cassidy et. al. study I cited

one pre-agriculture and the other post-agriculture.</p> 
<p>Amy,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Where is your evidence that this is what happened during the transition to 
agriculture?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve cited two sources above, one a peer-reviewed paper, the other an 
article by Jared Diamond synthesizing archaelogical research above. It&rsquo;s 
provided. And they&rsquo;re hardly isolated examples in the literature. For 
starters, research into !Kung and Masai compared to their agricultural 
neighbors is eye-opening.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Are you claiming that hunter-gather societies contained small numbers of 
individuals who lived to old age but had only a few children, all of whom 
survived to adulthood?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying that those H-Gs that did survive into adulthood had 
more robust health and longer life expectancies than their agricultural 
neighbors. But there are definitely advantages and lower infant mortality rates 
in agricultural socieities, as well as much higher birth rates (1 per year [ag] 
vs. 1 per 3-4 [H-G]).</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Because the archaeological record is replete with similar stories, 
as are historical accounts&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Really? Name 5.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The two cited above. </p> 
<p>3. I&rsquo;d also add contemporary accounts of the Mongol invastions into 
Chinese, Muslim and European terroitories. The nomadic Mongols were, on 
average, taller and stronger than the peoples they conquered.</p>

Mediterranean region over time and shows life expectancy dropping after the 
invention of agriculture, and not rising again for a few thousand years, then 
dropping again during the Middle Ages, then coming back up again. It also 
includes studies of nutrition and demonstrates that in terms of minerals and 
vitamins, people in the region didn&rsquo;t catch up to hunter-gatherers until 
relatively recently.</p>

produce more robust health outcomes than an agricultural one.</p> 
<p>My problem with Amy&rsquo;s argument is that her hypothesis is that longer 
modern lifespans is a combination of (1) modern medicine and (2) modern diet. I 
think that this hypothesis hasn&rsquo;t been demonstrated (Amy has yet to cite 
any research).</p> 
<p>Personally, I think the difference is almost entirely due to (1) and that 
(2) introduces problems of disease and malnourishment.</p> 
<p>From my personal research to date, I think that the evidence demonstrates 
that we ought to (a) keep modern medicine, because it&rsquo;s awesome and (b) 
emulate to the best of our abilities the traditional diet of hunter-gatherer 
societies using the tools of modern food production. I would love to see more 
studies on this to either confirm or deny my hypothesis.</p>

<p>I personally want the best of both worlds &ndash; the benefits of modern 
medicine combined with the robust health of the H-Gs who were able to survive 
disease, trauma and other people to have robust health into their 70s. Put the 
two together and I hypothesize that one could probably increase their lifespan

<p>I&rsquo;m not fan of the Garden of Eden fantasy and find the Noble Savage 
idea that has become popular to be incredibly condescending (not to mention 
rather colonialist). That said, fantasies about industrialization/technology 
are equally as silly. (Particularly something as silly as fetishing 
pesticides.) Technology=good, nature=bad is as dumb and reactionary as 
nature=good, technology=bad.</p> 
<p>I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to live in London in the 1500s, or 
the 1800s for that matter. All those people crammed in together burning 
whatever they could get their hands on for fuel was a recipe for disease and 
early death. Just as contemporary pollution contributes to both disease and 
death &ndash; this is one of the trade-offs of living in a city during any time.
</p> 
<p>How fabulous and healthy living in nature was or is really depends on where 
you live. If you live somewhere that&rsquo;s abundant in healthy food &ndash; 
Tahiti or Hawaii, or a fertile crescent or valley &ndash; you probably did 
pretty well in terms of longevity. People living in a traditional way in 
Okinawa are a good example of how a good diet, daily exercise (and probably 
some good genetic material) can play into living a long life. Science and 
medicine are just tools, it&rsquo;s what we do with them that determines 
whether they contribute to longevity or reduce it. Fetishising nature or 
technology/science and making either into an ideological all-good or all-bad 
proposition is indulging in fantasy rather than putting on al reality-based 
thinking cap to figure out what what works in the real world.</p> </li>

<p>Alive due to modern medicine:</p> 
<p>1) Me: I caught malaria several times when I was in West Africa. Treated 
with quinine. Alive today. (Note that in a pre-industrial world I would have 
been highly unlikely to have been in West Africa without having been born 
there, and if I had been born there I might have been heterozygous for 
sickle-cell&hellip; or, um, homozygous.)</p> 
<p>2) My mother: started bleeding in 7th month of pregnancy. Labour was 
induced.</p> 
<p>3) My father: treated with antibiotics for paratyphoid fever caught in 
Bangladesh.</p> 
<p>4) My sister? Burned herself with boiling water while breathing steam to 
treat a sinus infection. Ten days in the burn unit. Might have survived anyway, 
might have succumbed to infection. (Pre-industrially she might not have had a 
pot full of boiling water to spill on herself in the first place, so likely 
moot.)</p> 
<p>5) My beloved? Got an infected toe while mountain climbing. Was eventually 
able to get off the mountain and get treated. Probably would have been able to 
fight the infection anyway, but maybe he would have been too weak from low 
oxygen. (Recreational mountain climbing with very post-industrial equipment. 
Very unlikely to have been up that high if he had been pre-industrial, so moot 
wrt benefits of life-saving industrial technology.)</p> 
<p>Died from modern technology:</p> 
<p>1) My cousin; various acquaintances: car accident.</p> 
<p>2) My cousin: altitude sickness. Flew straight into Bolivia.</p> 
<p>All well and good. But what does that have to do with, say, whether we 
evolved to eat a plant-based diet supplemented with leaf-eating herbivores? Or 
whether extending our day with electric light is good for our neurology? Or why 
as a society North Americans are getting fatter, though affluent people retain 
their trim figures?</p> 
<p>Evolution isn&rsquo;t perfect but it is suggestive. It&rsquo;s possible 
that termites eat wood because that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s available to them, 
but that they would be much healthier as individuals and larger as a population 
if they were to eat whiskey instead because it has higher caloric density. But 
if I fed whiskey to a termite colony and they I discovered that they 
didn&rsquo;t actually do well, would it really be a naturalistic fallacy to 
look at what they evolved to eat?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that we mostly do better when we don&rsquo;t get 
infectious diseases (with the possible exception of helminths in some 
populations). Absolutely. And it&rsquo;s clear that a combination of modern 
birth control, modern infection control and modern obstetrics reduces perinatal 
mortality. Totally.</p> 
<p>But it does not follow that absolutely everything about post-industrial 
life is better than any imaginable aspect of pre-industrial life.</p> </li>

</p> 
<p>Fantastic point about menopause and its evolutionary purpose. The other 
thing we can do is look at our ape cousins who are hunter-gatherers (both 
chimps and bonobos). There are old apes that have useful roles in their group. 
There&rsquo;s no reason to romanticise humans over other apes. The idea that 
all life in nature is short and brutish seems to be as much a product of 
colonial mentality as the notion of the Noble Savage is &ndash; neither seem 
particularly accurate and both seem to look at nature from a rather misinformed 
and antiquated perspective that&rsquo;s really not very scientific (at least in

<p>&ldquo;Heh &mdash; I was menstruating two months after childbirth, both 
times, and I breastfed both my kids for over a year. It definitely is not 
reliable as a form of birth control.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Me too. I also nursed two babies at once, and it still didn&rsquo;t make a 
difference. Still, in general, lactation is the best bet for birth control if 
you don&rsquo;t have access to anything else. And it&rsquo;s actually 95-98% 
effective for the first six months as long as you nurse around the clock and 
don&rsquo;t have periods (too bad for me- I couldn&rsquo;t use it!). The 
failure rate is for that small chance you&rsquo;ll ovulate before menstruating, 
but many women have an anovulatory period the first time.</p> 
<p>Agriculture enabled people to stop moving around all the time to follow the 
food source. It also enabled us to have more time for other pursuits. A few 
people could feed an entire civilization. The H-G diet was plant based, while 
our diet is more meat based- this probably isn&rsquo;t the healthiest way to 
live, not to mention the inactive lifestyle we industrialists follow. 
Agriculture as the basis of our lifestyle has only been around for the past 
10,000 years, probably 1% of our evolutionary history. So, there are advantages 
and disadvantages and unintended consequences. Not sure why that&rsquo;s so 
controversial or romanticizing the past on sciencebasedmedicine.org.</p> 
<p>The black and white thinking is just bizarre. Not to mention using an 
AGRICULTURAL caused disease (smallpox/ cowpox) to prove one&rsquo;s point that 
modern agriculuture with pesticides is the main reason (in addition to modern 
medicine) for increasing human life expectancy.</p> </li>

<p>The US Presidents make a reasonable sample of white males who lived past 
about 50 years of age. I believe the current life expectancy for a 50 year old 
white male is about 34 years, more or less. The first ten presidents lived to 
an average age of 77.4 years. The next ten (omitting those murdered) lived to 
an average of 66.0 years. The next 10 lived to an average of 69.9 years. Nixon 
lived to 81 and Ford to 93. It seems to me that the life expectancy of a 50 
year old white male is now much better than the average age at death (77.1) of 
these first 30. So I think the notion that if one survived to 50 or so in 1870 
one could have expected to reach about the same age as a 50 year old can expect 
now is wrong on the facts.</p>

<p>My hunch is that hunter-gatherers, agrarians, pastoralists, and 
civilizationists are all basically equally &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;. However, 
it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the fact that there are a lot more of one group than 
the others. So, you&rsquo;re healthy *if you live to be*, and while I think 
it&rsquo;s exaggerating to say few people lived to menopause in the past, 
it&rsquo;s also unfair to ignore that a lot of people alive today would be dead 
if they&rsquo;d been living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p> 
<p>Since we&rsquo;re sharing lists of who&rsquo;s alive due to modern medicine:
</p> 
<p>* Me: meningitis at age 4 (two week hospitalization), umbilical hernia at 
age 6, chronic cystitis due to a diverticulum, asthma; there is a chance 
I&rsquo;d be alive today in a HG society, but I&rsquo;d likely be sickly</p> 
<p>* Eldest brother: life saved by surgery, specifically appendectomy</p> 
<p>* Middle brother: hospitalized with nephritis; kidney failure would be a 
horrible way to go</p> 
<p>* Youngest brother: resuscitated after crashing at 4 months of age; two 
months in ICU, respirator, tracheotomy, naso-gastric feedings, formula since 
Mom went dry due to the stress, numerous surgeries to repair the 
trachea&hellip;. He&rsquo;d definitely be dead. Directly owes his life to CPR.
</p> 
<p>* Husband: his mother had hepatitis while pregnant and had to be 
hospitalized; it&rsquo;s very likely the pregnancy would not have been 
successful without treatment, and as it is, he was born several weeks late and 
only 7 pounds (in a family where the babies tend to be big).</p> 
<p>* Brother-in-law: my mother-in-law lost her second baby, but never 
delivered it. Had surgical removal of the dead baby not been possible, she 
could never have become pregnant again (at least not safely).</p> 
<p>* a friend&rsquo;s daughter, who suffered an anoxic brain injury and, among 
other things, has to be fed through a tube implanted in her stomach (though 
everybody hopes that will not be permanent)</p> 
<p>* godmother, who is now several years cancer-free after treatment for 
breast cancer</p> 
<p>* cousin, who was diagnosed with celiac sprue, a really bad case &mdash; 
the slightest bit of gluten will shut down her digestive tract completely</p>

<p>Just to clarify, does Dr. Tuteur believe that obesity and lack of exercise

 at all? As far as I can tell, there is also a lot of 
concern among advocates of *conventional* medicine about all of these subjects.

<p>I love when people try to use &ldquo;look at all the notable people that

people typically had more resources at their disposal. You don&rsquo;t see 
people saying, &ldquo;look at how long that peasant Fishsmeller Barnaby 
lived&rdquo; because clearly he wasn&rsquo;t recorded.</p> 
<p>People often examine the famous or notable. Let&rsquo;s look at, for 
instance, George Washington. Well, of course, you can&rsquo;t extrapolate off 
one person&hellip; so widen the net to his family. I just yanked these from a 
single bio, but I tried to validate the ages.</p> 
<p>(Sibling) Able Pontomiac(SP?) Washington &ndash; (born &amp; died 1716?)<br>
 (Sibling) Mildred &ndash; (1739-1740) baby<br>
 (Sibling) Jane Washington, II 
&ndash; (1722-1735) 12 ish<br>
 (Dad&rsquo;s 1st Wife) JB died at 30<br>
 
Married Anne &mdash; had several children (at least 4), all died in childhood
<br> (Sibling) Demitrius Lawrence &ndash; (1718-1752) 34ish TB<br>
 (Sibling) 
Augustine, Jr. &ndash; (1720-1762) 40ish<br>
 (Sibling) John Augustine &ndash; 
(1736-1787) 50<br>
 (Sibling) Samuel &ndash; (1734-1781) 47ish<br>
 (Mom) MB 
&ndash; Dad&rsquo;s second wife, George&rsquo;s mom, 49<br>
 (Dad) Aug lived to 
49<br>
 (Sibling) Charles &ndash; (1738-1799) 50 ish<br>
 (Sibling ) George 
&ndash; (1732-1799) almost 70<br>
 (Sibling) Betty &ndash; (1733-1797) 70ish</p>
<p>So, the mean age would be between 34-40. Of the 17 easily found in the bio, 
8 didn&rsquo;t survive adolescence. Only three of the 17 made it past 50 years 
old.</p> 
<p>So, if you want to ask about famous people, then ask about Mildred 
Washington, the poet that never was, or Demitrius who died of a disease that we 
can easily diagnose and CURE! Or ask about Jane Washington, who was three years 
younger than Anne Frank.</p> 
<p>So, the stats that people died younger then seem accurate. It&rsquo;s clear 
that many would have lived much longer today, given nutrition, pre-natal care, 
competent ob-gyn care, anti-biotics, vaccinations and all the things we take 
for granted.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s even HIGHLY probable Washington himself would have lived much 
longer had he not been &ldquo;bled&rdquo; and given quack-therapy of molasses 
and the like after being diagnosed with the quinsy (LOL).</p> </li>

<p>I enjoyed the article. I am alive today because of modern medicine (adding 
to the unscientific poll). Perhaps the following can add to the premise of Dr 
Tuteurs article that abandoning modern medicine for the romantic notion of how 
we used to be healthier would be disastrous.</p> 
<p>Elizabeth Arias, Ph.D., Division of Vital Statistics, CDC published the 
following article,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Arias E. United States life tables, 2004.&rdquo; National vital 
statistics reports; vol 56 no 9. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health 
Statistics. 2007.,</p> 
<p>WWW URL reference</p> 
<p> which is an analysis of US Census data, and Medicare data for extraction 
of Vital Statistics, including survivorship curves, life tables, and simple 
life expectancy. The advantage of survivorship curves and life tables is the 
demonstration of mortality as a function of age. The survivor curve that I 
would call attention to is Figure 3. This is a plot of percent surviving by 
age, with different curves representing census data from 1900-1902, 1949-1951, 
and 2004 (which includes medicare data). The following is a quote from the 
discussion of Figure 3,<br>
 &ldquo;The survival curve for 1900&ndash;1902 
shows a rapid decline in survival in the first few years of life and a 
relatively steady decline thereafter. In contrast, the survival curve for 2004 
is nearly flat until about age 50 after which the decline in survival becomes 
more rapid. Improvements in survival between 1900&ndash;1902 and 
1949&ndash;1951 occurred at all ages, although the largest improvements were 
among the younger population. Between 1949&ndash;1951 and 2004, improvements 
occurred primarily for the older population.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This population data only covers recent time frames, and only in the United 
States. However, this would be the time frame and location in which we might 
expect to see an effect of modern medicine on longevity. The discussion in 
changes in mortality in this time frame focuses on the effect of rates of 
smoking, mortality due to HIV and accidents (both of which reached epidemic 
levels during some of this time frame), and reductions in mortality due to 
heart disease, malignant neoplasms, stroke, COPD, and pneumonia (primarily in 
the time frame of 2003 and 2004 in which more data from Medicare sources was 
available. This data agrees with the assertion by Dr Tuteur that modern 
medicine accounts for a significant fraction of the improvement in life 
expectancy. Public health measures may account for a significant fraction in 
improvement between 1900 and 1950, but modern medicine would still have had an 
effect. The gradual improvement in longevity in the US population has continued 
since 2004 (National Center for Health Statistics. Health, United States, 2009: 
With Special Feature on Medical Technology. Hyattsville, MD. 2009.)</p> 
<p>These are population statistics that support the assertion that modern 
medicine has much to do with increases in longevity. It would be hard to come 
up with an RCT. The use of survival curves and life tables avoids many of the 
arguments over the meaning of longevity, and the number of people alive at any 
given time of a certain age group.</p> 
<p>An argument based on logic (another component of scientific method, just 
ask Einstein) is the following formulation.<br>
 If we extrapolate the current 
measured rate of improvement in longevity backward in time, we would end up 
with an intuitively ridiculous life expectancy of zero somewhere between 1850 
and 1750. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the increase in life expectancy 
is nonlinear, even though we lack reliable population data before 1900. It is 
safe to surmise that public health measures and modern medicine (as well as 
changes in population habits) can take credit for the more recent improvement 
in longevity. Is this now theoretical SBM?</p> </li>

<p>It seems to me there are two CAM fallacies that Dr Amy is trying to kick 
out of the way here, the &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; fallacy and the 
&ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; fallacy.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately she doesn&rsquo;t do a great job, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, she doesn&rsquo;t make adequate distinction between &ldquo;the 
past&rdquo; (in the Traditional fallacy) and &ldquo;nature&rdquo; (in the 
Natural fallacy) &ndash; and that has been the cause of a lot of the comment on 
this thread.</p> 
<p>Second, she doesn&rsquo;t grasp what is actually wrong with these 
fallacies. You don&rsquo;t need to demonstrate that the past was hell and 
nature is a bitch in order to demonstrate the illogic of the Natural fallacy 
and the Traditional fallacy. If the fallacies stand or fall on the basis of 
whether Dr Amy has demonstrated her extreme assertions here &ndash; then they 
probably stand. But I&rsquo;m sure any one of her intellectually nimble and 
nuanced commentators could explain why the Natural fallacy and the Traditional 
fallacy utilized by CAM advocates are entirely fallacious. Such an explanation 
would be independent of the facts about hunter-gatherer societies, etc..that 
people are arguing about in this thread.</p> </li>

<p>Agreed. The use of &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;hell&rdquo; tends to 
indicate Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s just reacting to what is a fundamentally religious 
idea with her own religious ideas (and her own opposing brand of all good or 
all bad fundamentalism/ideological rigidity). Also, conflating medicine with 
pesticides and commercial farming just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. It&rsquo;s 
another sign that Dr Tuteur is making an ideological argument that&rsquo;s 
simply a reaction to an equally ideological argument rather than actually 
considering reality. It&rsquo;s being highly simplistic in the face of 
complexity in exactly the same way that those who promote the Naturalist 
fallacy are. There are aspects of technology that both support and destroy 
human health, just as there are aspects of nature and various cultural 
traditions that both support and destroy human health. It&rsquo;s a bit like Dr 
Tuteur thinks nature is the enemy when everything is part of the natural world, 
including the tools and technologies that humans create (be they health 
supporting or destructive to human health and happiness).</p> 
<p>As a woman, I&rsquo;m very glad I live in the time I do and I appreciate 
our technological advances. Does that mean I need to construct a faith in 
technology to replace a faith in a god? Or reject and fear the natural world of 
which I&rsquo;m a part (if only a little temporary blip)? Of course not. I can 
simply not adopt a religion at all and accept reality for what it is. Replacing 
one religion with another isn&rsquo;t freeing oneself from the fallacies of 
religion, it&rsquo;s simply rejecting reality for another form of religion that 
pretends to be reality and not a religion. Science/medicine/technology 
aren&rsquo;t gods, or articles of faith, they&rsquo;re merely tools that us 
humans use that can be used constructively or destructively and to support 
health and happiness or create illness and despair.</p> </li>

<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; &ldquo;Today, advocates of alternative health bemoan the 
current state of American health, the increasing numbers of obese people, the 
lack of exercise, the use of medications, the medicalization of childbirth. Yet 
life expectancy has never been longer, currently 77.7 years in the US.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Actually, a great deal of &ldquo;bemoaning the current state of American 
health&rdquo; is being done by medical experts and doctors. Once again Dr 
Tuteur is making it appear as if medicine doesn&rsquo;t promote exercise and a 
healthy diet as basic preventative medicine (and that these are the domain of 
&ldquo;alternative health&rdquo; rather than medicine). Medications are just a 
tool, used properly they&rsquo;re life enhancing or even life saving, used 
improperly they cause issues and even be deadly (the results of overuse of 
antibiotics is an obvious example of this, the pseudoscience promoted by the 
pharmaceutical industry is another). Obesity is a public health problem and 
lack of exercise contributes to obesity &ndash; it&rsquo;s simply a rejection 
of reality to pretend these aren&rsquo;t social and public health issues. 
Certainly we should be using SBM to address these issues but to pretend they 
don&rsquo;t exist is a rejection of reality for some kind of fantasy world 
that&rsquo;s no more realistic than that proposed by alternative medicine. Not 
only that, it makes the moderate promoters of alternative medicine seem quite 
sane and realistic in comparison and their claims that SBM is simply about 
uncritically promoting industry over public health true. If I wanted religion 
or some kind of simplistic good/evil fantasy world, I&rsquo;d be into 
alternative medicine or technofuturism not science and reality-based thinking.

wondering what she&rsquo;s claiming. Is she trying to tell me that when I give

<p>Her blanket claim about &ldquo;alternative health&rdquo; that &ldquo;none

definition is quite small, since supporting a claim like this seems difficult,

childhood, and to a lesser extent, the diseases of early and middle adulthood. 
That has inevitably led to an older population and an increase in the chronic

<p>Obesity, diabetes, asthma are all chronic diseases that have nothing to do 
with aging. Medicine certainly hasn&rsquo;t been successful in preventing these 
diseases and industrialization can very reasonably be argued as a contributing 
factor. In fact, doctors with attitudes such as the one you repeatedly show 
here have increasingly made basic preventative medicine the realm of 
alternative medicine. (Fortunately you don&rsquo;t speak for all doctors nor do 
you actually represent medicine, you&rsquo;re usually simply promoting your 
personal ideological position and resentments under the guise of standing up 
for SBM.) Considering that the evidence seems to be pointing to viruses playing 
a key role in many cancers (as well as lifestyle choices, like smoking, in 
some), your claims that cancer is a result of aging aren&rsquo;t actually very 
scientific. Like the people you&rsquo;re criticising, you&rsquo;re simply 
unthinkingly repeating cliche&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve heard.</p> 
<p>While the arguments that people promoting paleolithic diets make regarding 
evolution are rather silly, it&rsquo;s just as silly to not consider how we 
evolved and what we naturally need for optimum health when looking at the best 
ways to stay healthy and happy. It&rsquo;s like you believe and indulge in the 
same technology vs nature exclusionary ideology as the people you criticise, 
you&rsquo;re simply uncritically taking an oppositional position.</p> </li>

<p>Actually, quite a few have examined the peer-reviewed, scientific evidence 
and noted that, when you control for the problems of infectious disease and 
infant mortality, people on a H-G diet exhibit more robust health and have 
fewer incidences of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;looking to some mythical past&rdquo;&ndash;it&rsquo;s 
noting that hey, the modern diet doesn&rsquo;t promote health, longevity, or a 
good quality of life.</p> 
<p>There are, no doubt, some people who argue that people in the past lived to 
90, spoke with the voice of gods and could wipe out armies single-handedly. But 
most of the commenters here challenging your thesis are not these people.</p> 
<p>I am happy to admit that modern medicine saves lives, because there are 
ample scientific reasons to believe it. I am a big fan of modern medicine. I 
spend quite a bit of my own time railing against acupuncture, chiropractors, 
etc. My wife is currently expecting, and believe me, we have a great 
OB&ndash;not a midwife.</p> 
<p>But I do oppose your assertion that &ldquo;modern industrial 
agriculture&rdquo; promotes health because the evidence stands very strongly 
against it. I have offered plenty of evidence to support my position on this, 
from archaeological sources and peer-reviewed research.</p> 
<p>It is a mistake in logic to assume that &ldquo;progress&rdquo; is some 
unilateral arrow, and that as some progress is made, all aspects of the culture 
progress at the same time. We can move forward in some areas, but not in 
others. The Enlightenment was followed by religious revival in the United 
States, but science and technology still progressed and life expectancies still 
increased. I would not take from this evidence that religious revivals improve 
life expectancies.</p> </li>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s just stupid to say life in the past was

lives, some would have had crappy ones &ndash; just like today. Clearly some 
people in the past in all kinds of societies and cultures enjoyed their lives 
very much, there are all kinds of records that show this to be true.</p> 
<p>Now, I have no desire to hop into a time machine to live in the past and I 
appreciate how far medicine and scientific knowledge have advanced even in my 
own lifetime but to assume that all throughout history before now that life was 
&ldquo;hell&rdquo; is just ridiculous! It&rsquo;s as stupid as all the Garden 
of Eden fantasies about the past and just as reactionary, religious and

<p>My own definition of &ldquo;alternative medicine,&rdquo; by the way, is 
simply &ldquo;stuff you can do for yourself that doesn&rsquo;t involve a 
gatekeeper.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The absence of a gatekeeper means that this category can contain a whole 
heaping pile of utter nonsense. There&rsquo;s no filter. But this definition 
also includes things like meditation, massage and exercise for managing stress 
and pain; cranberry juice for UTIs; honey on wounds; prunes for constipation; 
whiskey or Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Tea for insomnia. These remedies may 
or may not be the best possible, but even when they aren&rsquo;t they are often 
good enough.</p> 
<p>I personally keep goldenseal capsules at home as a topical antibiotic. 
It&rsquo;s not that I think it&rsquo;s better than anything else. It&rsquo;s 
that I can have it handy at 8:00 at night when my beloved (who usually heals 
very slowly) has a dirty cut on his hand, and it&rsquo;s not greasy and 
occlusive like drugstore antibiotic creams.</p> 
<p>If your definition of alternative medicine is &ldquo;anything that 
doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo; &mdash; well, of course it doesn&rsquo;t work. But 
you need to be clear about that upfront, because other people have other

<p>Obviously both extremes are wrong. There are pros and cons about modern 
life, and their were pros and cons in the past. It is not romanticizing to 
admit that we have some problems now, or that some things were better in some 
previous societies. Using average lifespan as the measure of a society&rsquo;s 
health is wrong. For one thing, prehistoric lifespans are hard to estimate. And 
if you do not consider infant mortality, the distribution is extremely skewed.
</p> 
<p>Infant mortality has been conquered by modern medicine. Normally, it is 
very high in all species including humans, because (in my opinion) it is one of 
nature&rsquo;s mechanisms for keeping species healthy.</p> 
<p>Other triumphs of modern medicine were antibiotics and vaccines, and 
improved diagnostic and surgical technology.</p> 
<p>Yes, the average lifespan has dramatically increased, but that does not 
mean health has improved.</p> 
<p>It is not being fanatical or fundamentalist to say that modern Americans 
tend to be very unhealthy and dependent on medical treatments. This may be 
partly because a certain percentage of humans have always been weak and 
vulnerable to disease, because that&rsquo;s life. But the modern lifestyle is 
definitely a big factor.</p> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read the previous comments so I might be re-stating the 
obvious which has already been stated. But I just had to contribute because Dr. 
T always exaggerates the wonderfulness of modern life, and always said 
everything was horrible before modern medicine and technology. She is a devout 
futurist, or something. Definitely a devout fundamentalist.</p> 
<p>Lifestyle matters. She says people are getting heart disease and cancer 
only because modern medicine has given them so many additional years of life. 
Rubbish. People who survived childhood in pre-modern times were likely to get 
old, and they were NOT likely to get heart disease or cancer.</p> 
<p>Dr. T accuses those of us who advocate a healthy lifestyle of romanticizing 
the past. Some might, but most probably don&rsquo;t. We are very aware that the 
past was no garden of Eden. But Dr. T does the opposite and romanticizes the 
present. We have lots of serious problems now. Your head must be deep in the 
sand not to see them.</p> </li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose for the sake of argument that the claims advanced in 
those papers are true. That would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for 
preventing heart disease and type II diabetes. That would NOT mean that the 
diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get 
heart disease and type II diabetes.</p> 
<p>So the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease 
and type II diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious 
disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything 
else.</p> 
<p>And for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart 
disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted 
with it.</p> </li>

Seasonings Sleepytime Tea for insomnia. These remedies may or may not be the

enough.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Taking into account that both you and Dr Tutuer are sharing personal 
meanings regarding the term &ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo;, I think 
it&rsquo;s important to note that there&rsquo;s increasingly sound scientific 
evidence for meditation and exercise for managing stress and chronic pain. And 
that theories about neuroplasticity are grounded in neuroscience, so I 
don&rsquo;t see these as being outside of medicine or &ldquo;alternative 
medicine&rdquo; at this point. That said, meditation for pain management 
certainly started out as &ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo; and was viewed with 
suspicion (and still is by some reactionary types) and neurplasticity was 
denied by &ldquo;modern medicine&rdquo; for quite a long time. (|The advent of 
the MRI radically changed our scientific understanding of the brain.) Prunes 
are certainly a traditional cure for constipation &ndash; and generally pretty 
effective &ndash; but they do get prescribed by doctors too!</p> 
<p>One reason why I question the highly reactionary positions of someone like 
Dr Tuteur who rails against some undefined and vague Other such as 
&ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo; in such a simplistic and ideological way is 
that grand claims are made about areas where we still don&rsquo;t have a 
complete understanding. (And areas where Dr Tuteur is quite obviously not an 
expert herself, she quite often proposes quite old fashioned and reactionary 
ideas that aren&rsquo;t supported by contemporary scientific understandings or 
that don&rsquo;t take into account complexity and the limits of current 
knowledge. The end result is that she very often resembles the very ideologues

so reactionary and ideological that you&rsquo;ll even argue against a healthy

so. You seem so wrapped up ina an ideological position that you&rsquo;ll even

<p>Yes, I was assuming we all knew that. Do I need to be more careful? Have I 
inadvertently stepped into an area of controversy? I&rsquo;m sorry, I 
didn&rsquo;t mean to: my ignorance is showing again.</p> 
<p>In any case, the premise of sound scientific evidence was my premise for my 
two groups of health care without gatekeepers: one that is utter nonsense, and 
another that is not utter nonsense and that may or may not be the best approach 
to the problem at hand. The &ldquo;not utter nonsense&rdquo; category by 
definition has at least some degree of scientific support. (Note that it may 
have a lot of scientific support and that the vague descriptor &ldquo;may or

<p>Alison &ndash; Oh, I just don&rsquo;t assume that we all know about the 
scientific evidence for meditation and exercise (and often find it&rsquo;s 
necessary to clarify that these are part of medicine as well as being promoted 
by &ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo;). Dr Tuteur seems to have a prejudice 
against non-pharmaceutical or surgical treatments and, for some strange reason 
exercise and a healthy diet. Plus a lot of people don&rsquo;t seem to have a 
very good grasp of neuroplasticity or cognitive science so I tend to leap in to 
stick up for these as being useful for chronic pain management and some forms 
of mental disorders since they do get denigrated even by doctors who are stuck 
in very old fashioned and simplistic understandings of chronic pain and 
neurobiology. Sorry about that and thanks for clarifying </p> </li>

<p>That assertion is not only irrelevant but actually works against you 
because the other poster is talking about contemporary humans eating a 
paleolithic diet and preventing heart disease is very relevant since we do live 
longer! He presented contemporary studies and didn&rsquo;t simply make grand 
(and often inaccurate) assertions about the past like you&rsquo;ve been doing. 
He&rsquo;s even saying he&rsquo;s a big supporter of SBM (as am I). Seriously, 
you&rsquo;re not even arguing from basic logic, science or interest in

<p>Amy says:</p> 
<p>So the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease 
and type II diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious 
disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything 
else.</p> 
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
</p> 
<p>The scientific community says:</p> 
<p>http://www.emedmag.com/html/pre/gic/consults/101504.asp</p> 
<p>The decline of appendicitis cases in the United States since the 1930s has 
led some to suggest that dietary fiber or household hygiene is important in the 
pathogenesis of appendicitis. According to the &ldquo;fiber hypothesis,&rdquo; 
fecaliths develop more readily in people who consume a diet deficient in fiber, 
because their stools are more tenacious. Societies with high fiber intake 
(Asia, India, Africa) have less than one-tenth the incidence of appendicitis 
compared with locations where fiber intake is lower (Europe, North America). A 
high-fiber diet speeds stool transit times, reduces fecal viscosity, and 
inhibits fecalith formation.</p> 
<p>WIKI<br>
 Several studies offer evidence that a low fiber intake is 
involved in the pathogenesis of appendicitis[14] [15][16]. This is in 
accordance with the occurrence of a right sided fecal reservoir and the fact 
that dietary fiber reduces transit time[17].</p> 
<p>http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1424025<br>
 This study 
gives evidence that low fiber intake could play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of appendicitis</p> 
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>@Alison &ndash;<br>
 You&rsquo;re misrepresenting what Dr. Tuteur said, 
either that or you stopped reading after the sentence you quoted becuase she 
also said:</p> 
<p><b>So the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart 
disease and type II diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious 
disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything 
else.</b></p><b> </b>
<p><b>And for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart 
disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted 
with it.</b></p> 
<p>I read her comment and I didn&rsquo;t read it the way you interperted it. I 
don&rsquo;t see her as saying that the diet kills people. I see her as saying 
that , even if the diet eaten in paletolithic time was the ideal diet for no 
heart disease, etc it didn&rsquo;t help protect the paleolithic people from 
sucummbing from non-dietary related illnesses and accidents that shortened the 
lifespan because of the paleolithic people did not have the medical knowledge 
and medicine to treat or cure those illnesses and accidents.</p> 
<p>Which makes sense for her to point out because there are a lot of people 
who believe in alternative &ldquo;natural&rdquo; healing that argue that not 
only is the paleolithic diet far superior to our modern diet but the 
paleolithich and &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; treatments and use of herbs, plants, 
and folk healing is far superior to science-based modern medicine.</p> 
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve seen blogs and websites where people will say they 
don&rsquo;t believe in or use allopathic medicine and only use natural herbs, 
plants and traditional remedies that have been used for 1000s of years because 
it&rsquo;s far superior to &ldquo;allopathic&rdquo; and modern medicine.</p>

<p>As per Fifi&rsquo;s point above, if it turns out that<br>
 A) there is 
something that it makes sense to call a &ldquo;paleolithic diet,&rdquo; and<br>

 B) that it coincidentally is associated with lower rates of heart disease in 
people who have access to modern medicine, then<br>
 C) a plausible hypothesis 
would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had 
lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.</p> 
<p>If evolution selected paleolithic people for lower rates of heart disease, 
that suggests that enough of them were living long enough that heart disease 
mattered.</p> 
<p>One hypothesis to explain high rates of heart disease in aboriginal 
Canadians today is that they are not adapted to a grain-based diet. If 
evolution was able to select for resistance to heart disease in grain-based 
cultures over the past 10,000 years, it suggests that enough of us were living 
long enough that selection pressure to resist heart disease was acting very 
quickly.</p> 
<p>These are a lot of ifs &mdash; speculative! But it will be interesting to 
see where the lines of evidence end up pointing, either way.</p> </li> 
<li> # Alex Knapp <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 2:22 pm </em> 
<p>Amy,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose for the sake of argument that the claims advanced in 
those papers are true. That would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for 
preventing heart disease and type II diabetes. That would NOT mean that the 
diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get 
heart disease and type II diabetes.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I beg to differ. See the following studies:</p> 
<p>Apparent absence of stroke and ischaemic heart disease in a traditional 
Melanesian island: a clinical study in Kitava. Lindeberg S, Lundh B. J Intern 
Med. 1993 Mar;233(3):269-75</p> 
<p>Age relations of cardiovascular risk factors in a traditional Melanesian 
society: the Kitava Study. Lindeberg S, Berntorp E, Nilsson-Ehle P, 
Ter&eacute;nt A, Vessby B. Am J Clin Nutr. 1997 Oct;66(4):845-52.</p> 
<p>Low serum insulin in traditional Pacific Islanders&ndash;the Kitava Study. 
Lindeberg S, Eliasson M, Lindahl B, Ahr&eacute;n B. Metabolism. 1999 
Oct;48(10):1216-9.</p> 
<p>The Kitavans of Paupa New Guinea provide an interesting counterpoint to 
your claims. There are low rates of infectious disease (because they&rsquo;re 
an isolated population) and they follow a hunter-gatherer diet as they are 
non-agricultural (although, of course, that&rsquo;s changing.)</p> 
<p>Overall life expectancy of the Kitavans is 45 (because like most 
populations without access to modern obstetrics, infant mortality is 
high)&ndash;which the U.S. did not match about 1900. HOWEVER, life expectancy 
at age 50 is 75&ndash;which the U.S. did not match until 1980&ndash; and a 
signficant portion of the population reaches that age. Among elderly Kitavans, 
incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia are incredibly low.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s without access to modern medicine, obstetrics, etc. Because 
they&rsquo;re an isolated population that experiences little infectious 
disease, they provide a nice control for what a H-G diet looks like when you 
control for infectious disease. The result are very healthy people who live a 
long time if they survive childhood.</p> 
<p>Now, combine knowledge of this diet with modern medicine and place it in a 
modern context, and it appears we have an extraordinary way to improve health.
</p> 
<p>Finally, Amy, one quick question for you. According to my review of the 
literature, diabetes and heart disease are primarily caused by diet. What is 
your evidence that they are merely the products of age apart from mere 
correlation to incidence within age groups in the United States?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;C) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially

<p>lillym, </p> 
<p>I take your point, but Amy was responding to Alex. Alex was saying that 
there&rsquo;s no evidence that modern agriculture provides a healthier diet. 
(Amy had pointed to the twin pillars of modern agriculture and modern medicine 
as being the basis of modern health and longevity.) Agriculture provides 
concentrated abundance, and therefore can support a larger population, but the 
grain-based diets of agriculture are not necessarily healthier. (Alex seems to 
distinguish between modern agriculture producing nutrient-deficient food vs 
ancient agriculture that produced nutrient-dense food, a distinction I am 
hesitant to make.) His proposal is that we are healthy and long-lived today 
because we have access to modern medicine, not because we eat grain.</p> 
<p>Amy&rsquo;s response was that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if a paleolithic diet 
prevents chronic disease because nobody eating it could live long enough to get 
chronic disease anyway.</p> 
<p>What Amy may have <i>meant</i> was that even if a paleolithic-style diet 
protects against chronic disease in post-industrial societies, it did not do so 
in paleolithic societies because everyone died before chronic disease could 
have affected them anyway.</p> 
<p>Or she possibly was thinking vaguely and conflated &ldquo;paleolithic 
diet&rdquo; with &ldquo;medicine-free paleolithic lifestyle.&rdquo; I 
can&rsquo;t tell.</p> 
<p>However, neither what she said nor what she may have meant make sense as a 
response to Alex.</p> 
<p>In addition, if Alex&rsquo;s thesis is correct, that would be a strand of 
evidence in the direction that in fact we<i>did</i> live long enough that 
resistance to chronic disease would have beneficial. So his thesis is not 
irrelevant to Amy&rsquo;s contention that everyone died young before modern 
agriculture and medicine.</p> </li>

<p><i>Evolution is the result of reproductive success of individuals fittest 
for the particular environment in which they live. There is no evidence that 
the Paleolithic diet was the &ldquo;best&rdquo; diet; it was the only diet.</i>
</p> 
<p>That is absolutely correct, but it does not address what I said. </p> 
<p>In a population of humans eating the only diet available to them over the 
course of, say, 100,000 years, heart disease will exert selection pressure to 
eliminate genes for susceptibility to heart disease<i>under those particular 
conditions</i> from the gene pool only if<br>
 1) people can live long enough 
to get heart disease under those conditions anyway, and<br>
 2) people who are 
resistant to heart disease have more grandchildren.</p> 
<p>There are various strands of evidence that suggest this could be exactly 
what happened.</p> 
<p><i>If</i> this is what happened, that suggests that a not-insignificant 
proportion of the population got old,<i>and</i> that old people were

<p>Unfortunately Dr Tuteur seems to wantonly ignore whole fields of medical 
science and likes to make grand proclamations about fields of medicine that are 
outside of her specialty as an OB/GYN. It&rsquo;s like epigenetics, sports 
medicine, cognitive science, pain medicine, evolutionary biology, environmental 
health and so on simply don&rsquo;t exist to Dr Tuteur. While I find alt 
medicine claims about &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; as being some form of proof 
silly, I also find it quite entertaining that Dr Tuteur herself seems unable to 
move beyond certain traditional medical beliefs that contemporary medical 
science doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to and is actually quite reactionary in her 
beliefs rather than curious about contemporary science and new discoveries.</p>

<p>In addition to the weight loss from 235 to 175 so far, I&rsquo;m off the 
allergy meds I was on since I was a teenager, GURD meds, and without meds I 
brought my average BP from 150-160 / 95-105 to normal ranges.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite simple:</p> 
<p>1. Real Food only (meat, fish, fowl, natural fats, veggies, fruits, nuts). 
Especially: eliminate flour, sugar, vegetable &amp; seed oils.</p> 
<p>2. Go hungry sometimes. I fasted twice per week while losing the weight and 
now I do it once per week, 18-30 hours, typically.</p> 
<p>3. Work out briefly but intensely and explosively, and do it hungry.</p> 
<p>4. Play often, and gets lots of sleep.</p>

<p>Well you&rsquo;re out of touch with average Americans then. Most work long

bicycling on suburban streets lately? I do it, but it&rsquo;s scary, because 
drivers do not watch for bicyclists or pedestrians, in general.</p> 
<p>Technology freed us from having to walk or do physical labor. I don&rsquo;t 
know if we have more free time now. It depends on what culture you are 
comparing to. And for prehistoric cultures, we really don&rsquo;t know, and it 
probably varied greatly.</p> 
<p>At least some of the primitive tribes studied in the early 20th century 
worked much less than we do. But factory workers in the early industrial age

of lifestyle. She repeatedly says that cancer and heart disease are normal 
diseases of aging. In other words, we will get them regardless of lifestyle. In 
her opinion, stone age people would have had cancer and heart disease if they 
didn&rsquo;t die so young (ad she steadfastly ignores the infant mortality 
factor).</p> 
<p>She always comes down on one side of any controversy she writes about. She 
is always opposed to people who advocate anything &ldquo;natural.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Living in accordance with the nature we evolved with &mdash; to some degree 
anyway &mdash; requires conscious effort. After you have spent 8 hours at the 
office and 2 hours in your car, you have to deliberately and consciously make 
time for physical exercise. I can understand why most Americans don&rsquo;t do 
it.</p> 
<p>I exercise every day and it requires discipline and planning. It is no 
longer a normal part of life, for most of us.</p> </li>

<p>[That both cancer and heart disease are among the primary causes of death 
today represents a victory, not a defeat. Diseases of old age can become 
primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are 
vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.]</p> 
<p>She always says this. Cancer and heart disease are a victory! So why are 
there non-Westernized cultures where these &ldquo;old age&rdquo; diseases are 
rare, even among the old? And why are relatively young people getting these 
diseases in Westernized cultures?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;So much for the evolutionary advantage of the hunter gatherer diet: 
it has led to the near extinction of the hunter gatherers.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As you have said before, there is no such thing as an evolutionary 
advantage of a hunter-gatherer diet.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone has disputed that agriculture can support a 
larger population than hunting and gathering. Food can be cultivated more 
intensively, grain can be stored, babies can be weaned earlier.</p> 
<p>The premise of the paleolithic diet is not that it offered anyone an 
evolutionary advantage. That&rsquo;s exactly wrong. The premise is that 
for&hellip; 200,000? years, people who did well on it were more genetically fit 
because that&rsquo;s all there was.</p> </li> 
<li> # Alison Cummins <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 5:06 pm </em> 
<p>And the question RE agriculture is whether the people who are the most 
genetically fit on a paleolithic diet are the same individuals who are most 
genetically fit on a grain-based diet.</p> 
<p>The suggestion is that they aren&rsquo;t the same. And that most of us are 
still stuck with a lot of paleolithic genes.</p> 
<p>(Individuals from cultures with 10,000 years of grain-eating are less 
susceptible to diet-related chronic disease on a grain-based diet than are 
individuals from cultures who switched to a grain-based diet only recently, so 
there appears to have been some evolution in grain-eating populations.) (That 
is, if the whole paleolithic diet thesis is correct.)</p> </li>

<p>I feel the spirit of Dr. T&rsquo;s post is intact, despite whatever 
complaints the usual suspects seem to have with whatever it is they complain 
about. Here&rsquo;s why:</p> 
<p>The claim is that (in regards to paleo diet)</p> 
<p>a) People of yesteryear ate &ldquo;better&rdquo; as per their reliance on 
natural foods; and<br>
 b) Avoided diseases as a result of that; and<br>
 c) We 
should return to that to gain similar benefits</p> 
<p>Fantastic! Which cavemen? Which part of the world? The leaders? The grunts? 
The women? The children? During ice ages? During warm spells? Within forests? 
On the plains? In the mountains? During the summer? In conjunction with extreme 
fasting? Should we all, as a result, abide by some singular cavemen regiment? 
Relying on the meager evidence of the distant past to guide our actions is a 
fruitless exercise that is overly romanticized; the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the 
post.</p> 
<p>It additionally becomes enormously absurd because all of the things that 
various charlatans and CAM foodies say are necessary for health would have been 
exclusive to a particular region and particularly impossible for any one group 
or individual to acquire anyway. Further, no one could get green tea, acai 
berry, seaweed, tomatoes, pomegranates, fish, raw cocoa, quinoa and almonds all 
in the same area.</p> 
<p>Shall we discuss what actually *is* the best for a modern human (based on 
research&hellip;maybe) and forget what *may* have benefited any random segment 
of cavemen? I very much enjoy this blog, it becomes exceedingly tedious to keep 
up with the good nuggets of info amongst the various squabbles.</p> 
<p>Can anyone say, &ldquo;food low in saturated fat, salt, sugar and high in 
unsaturated fat, lean protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals?&rdquo; Have we 
ever heard/found/seen/read that something to the contrary might be better?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The choice is between being resistant to heart disease on a given 
diet or not being resistant to heart disease on the same diet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Only if it confers an evolutionary advantage and you&rsquo;ve not 
demonstrated that it does.</p> 
<p>The thrust of your argument is the naturalistic fallacy: because we ate X 
in nature, then X must be the best thing to eat.</p> 
<p>Human beings and their ancestors have been around for millions of years, 
and for most of that time, they did not eat meat. At some point, they became 
skilled hunters and were able to obtain meat. This conferred a tremendous 
advantage because it provided a more nutrient rich food source. It didn&rsquo;t 
matter that the ancestors of the first meat eaters didn&rsquo;t eat meat. It 
was beneficial for the new meat eaters anyway.</p> 
<p>Similarly, for most of human existence, meat was not cooked. Yet with the 
ability to master fire came the ability to cook meat and release even more 
nutrients. It did not matter that the ancestors of those who cooked meat had 
not done so. The cooked meat was still more nutritious and that nutrition could 
be accessed by the first people who cooked meat.</p> 
<p>The hunter gatherer culture has been a dismal failure compared to the 
farming culture. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that we were originally hunter 
gatherers. Farming conferred a tremendous advantage.</p> 
<p>What exists in nature is what exists in nature. It is not the 
&ldquo;best&rdquo; or the &ldquo;healthiest&rdquo; or what &ldquo;we 
evolved&rdquo; to eat. It is simply what was available.</p> </li> 
<li> # Alison Cummins <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 5:20 pm </em> 
<p>For example, if there is a population who lives on nothing but 
McDonald&rsquo;s food for the next 10,000 years and then their children 
suddenly started eating a high-fibre, low-fat diet, I would expect to see a 
huge crisis in volvulus and diseases related to cholesterol deficiency.</p> 
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t make McDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;superior.&rdquo; It would 
just mean that those people would probably be happier if they dialled back the 
fibre and made an effort to include more butter in their diets.</p> </li> 
<li> # Alex Knapp <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 5:20 pm </em> 
<p>Amy,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>So this &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; diet that &ldquo;we evolved to eat&rdquo; is 
responsible for the fact that hunter gathers have spread to every corner of the 
globe and now number in the billions. Oh, wait. That would be the farmers. The 
hunter gathers only exist in tiny, isolated populations that will soon be 
extinct.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>That&rsquo;s because, simply put, farming is <i>easier</i> than 
hunter-gathering. More food can be produced more quickly, thus supporting 
larger populations. Those populations were then able to drive out H-Gs from 
their native territories because they had larger armies, even though H-Gs were 
generally taller and stronger. (for example, Plains Indians were taller than 
the Western calvarymen who waged war on them &mdash; see
http://eh.net/XIIICongress/cd/papers/70PrinceSteckel378.pdf). </p> 
<p>I have not disputed the fact that agriculture allows larger populations to 
be supported. That&rsquo;s pretty much self-evident. Additionally, agriculture 
allowed the development of cities and technology. Thus, agricultural societies 
were able to overcome H-G tribes by virtue of superior weaponry and higher 
populations. See e.g. &ldquo;Guns, Germs and Steel&rdquo; by Jared Diamond.</p> 
<p>But the individuals within those larger agricultural populations suffered 
poorer health than individuals within H, and continued to do so until the 
advent of modern medicine, as the numerous papers I have cited in this comment 
threat demonstrate.</p> 
<p>So once again I say that the available evidence suggests that we could 
promote better health by keeping the advantages of modern medicine, while at 
the same time steering our agricultural industry and diet to one that emulates 
the macronutrient constitution of a paleolithic diet. I have supported this 
thesis with numerous peer-reviewed research articles in the fields of nutrition 
and archeology throughout this thread.</p> 
<p>And in all this time, you have yet to provide any support for your thesis 
that modern industrial agriculture produces superior health outcomes, nor have 
you supported your thesis that diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are 
primarily diseases of age. I am willing to review any papers that you provide 
citation for, but you&rsquo;ve yet to do so.</p> </li>

<p>A successful &ldquo;paleo diet,&rdquo; I think, would be predicated on what 
it eliminates. We may not know precisely what paleolithic humans were eating, 
but we have a pretty good idea of what they were not:</p> 
<p>refined sugar, especially fructose (wild, ancient fruits weren&rsquo;t bred 
for hypersweetness)<br>
 grains (especially gluten grains) in any appreciable 
amounts (just try harvesting enough wild grain to bake a loaf of bread)<br>
 
industrial vegetable oils high in pro-inflammatory Omega 6 fatty acids</p> 
<p>Some ate mostly carnivorous (Masai, Inuit), while others thrived on roots, 
fish, and coconuts (Kitava, Tokelau). Eat whole foods that don&rsquo;t require 
industrial processing or intense agriculture, and you&rsquo;re eating an 
essentially paleolithic diet.</p> </li>

<p>fairly enough, most of what is contained within the paleo diet is roundly 
accepted as nutritious food. but nutritious food is nutritious food. it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter who ate it, when, why, how, what the alternatives may or

<p>&ldquo;Shall we discuss what actually *is* the best for a modern human

<p>Historically speaking, the best way to examine the effects of the 
paleolithic diet are to look at MODERN human hunter-gatherers and their health. 
There is a great deal of historical/ anthropological research going on in this 
area&hellip; and Dr. Tuteur ignores all of it. Furthermore, research shows that 
as these people transition to the western diet (like Native pacific Islanders), 
they have extremely high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. And no, 
it&rsquo;s not just because all of a sudden they are living longer. I am also

<p>every single medical discovery started as &ldquo;alternative.&rdquo; we 
decide what&rsquo;s true based on evidence, randomized controlled trials, etc, 
not by pigeonholing it into an &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; or

<p>I have read your post on Michael Pollan in the past, Dr. Hall, and enjoyed 
it. However, if I was already skeptical of the book, I would have not been 
convinced by the post. And in fact, I have read posters in the past commenting 
on the lack of citations in a few of your posts. I also thought the Business of 
Being Born post was well balanced (unlike Dr. T), but lacking in research to 
back it up. It really comes down to personal preference, I suppose. I&rsquo;m 
not going to take anybody&rsquo;s word for something on a blog (particularly 
outside their area of expertise) just because they are a doctor or posting on 
sbm. However, you also avoid making black and white, absolute statements, and 
tend to look at both sides of an issue fairly, discussing pros and cons of your 
positions. Your post on acupuncture about two months ago was one of my 
favorites to date on this website.</p> 
<p>Dr. Tuteur also tends to garner hundreds of comments for the simple reason 
that she actually responds to people and questions. She also (almost never) 
takes criticism personally, which I like.</p> </li>

<p>Sorry, should have been more clear. I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily disagreeing 
with you, because I wasn&rsquo;t sure what you meant. The quote just reminded 
me that some people think all H-G are dead or confined to reservations or 
something. True, they aren&rsquo;t the same, but if anthropologists are going 
to look at human life spans throughout history, looking at (fast disappearing) 
modern day hunter-gatherers is the next best thing, given the relative paucity 
of data about people from 200,000 years ago.</p> 
<p>Of course, my history background just automatically causes me to cringe 
when I see people imply that there is nothing of value to be learned from

 &ldquo;Fantastic! Which cavemen? Which part of the world?&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Alison &ndash; &ldquo;Yes, I agree, that is an important and valid 
criticism of the paleolithic diet hypothesis.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Agreed. Different populations in different areas had very different diets 
and different survival challenges so had very different health outcomes. Living 
in Tahiti or a fertile valley is quite different than living in the arctic, 
though people survive and thrive in both environments. (Just like different 
urban environments throughout history had had different heath issues.)</p> 
<p>Not only that, different peoples evolved differently due to different 
evolutionary pressures. This plays out in contemporary health issues in 
different populations. For instance, African Americans are vulnerable to sickle 
cell anemia and sensitivity to salt and are prone to hypertension. The first is 
theorized to be protective against malaria, the second is generally considered 
to be a result of who survived the slave ships or the African environment (or 
the African environment, there&rsquo;s some debate about this). Also, African 
Americans are more likely to be lactose intolerant than people of Eastern 
European descent. Things such as whether your grandparents lived through a 
famine will also have a genetic repercussion. It&rsquo;s some pretty fascinate 
stuff that contemporary research has been uncovering vis a vis nutrition and 
genes and we&rsquo;re only starting to understand how environmental pressures 
shape genetic expression.</p> 
<p>Now, none of this actualy validates a paleolithic diet but it does reveal 
that evolution is not meaningless when it comes to nutrition and health.</p> 
<p>Also, agricultural societies have a downside. The rapid expansion and rapid 
population growth tends to result in environmental destruction, which in turn 
results in civilizations collapsing. It also tends to result in wars and the 
fostering and spread of disease. (Humans are animals like any other, you put 
too many of us in close quarters with poor sanitation and it becomes the 
perfect environment for diseases to incubate and spread between humans and 
other animals, as well as having detrimental psychlogical effects.) All modes 
of living have their advantages and disadvantages, to romanticize any of them 
is creating fantasies that deny reality. Yes, contemporary medicine is 
generally a good thing but it also has a dark side for humanity as a whole that 
few of the faithful like to acknowledge.</p> </li>

<p>Rereading Dr. Hall&rsquo;s post on Michael Pollan&rsquo;s book, I can see 
that the comments are almost all negative comments (9 out 11), and one asked 
for a citation. My suspicion that many skeptics are anti environmentalists is 
being strengthened&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> # Basiorana <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 9:08 pm </em> 
<p>I think one of the major things to remember is that we have a bad habit of 
looking at modern hunter-gatherers as an example of how we must have lived back 
then. This is false for several reasons: First, most of our major diseases that 
strike hunter-gatherers today came from domestication of animals and spread by 
cities and long-distance trade; we don&rsquo;t really know what our own 
hunter-gatherer ancestors died of in terms of infectious disease. It&rsquo;s 
likely that starvation, death by animal attacks, death in childbirth, malaria 
in tropical regions, and sepsis in wounds were more common than influenza (from 
pigs and chickens), smallpox (from cattle), or tuberculosis (also cattle).</p> 
<p>Second, humans did not abruptly stop evolving 10,000 years ago. Modern 
hunter-gatherers have spent the whole time we&rsquo;ve been developing 
agriculture evolving to their lifestyle and weeding out bad genes. They have 
had a strong selective pressure to be faster, stronger, and less prone to local 
diseases. Of course, their isolation left them susceptible to our diseases, and 
when they eat stuff like milk and sugary snacks they have health problems. But 
their health tendencies will naturally be different from ours (meaning 
descendants of farmers, like myself) since they evolved in a different habitat 
with a different diet, different ecological pressures, and different founding 
genes to begin with.</p> 
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve also evolved. It&rsquo;s important to remember that the 
switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture was neither overnight, nor 
cold-turkey. It was a slow, gradual change over hundreds of generations, as we 
slowly added small, hardy plots to supplement our gathering diet and eventually 
transitioned. During that time we were evolving too&ndash; gaining things like 
lactose tolerance and improved grain digestion. The reason I dislike the 
paleolithic diet is because while it may well be ancestral for a person whose 
ancestors lived in the Pacific Northwest, anyone whose pre-colonialism 
ancestors lived in a food-producing region has evolved to consume grain. 
Everyone&rsquo;s ancestors diets were different. My ancestors were Celtic and 
Scandinavian; they had a diet based on milk, domesticated cattle, fish, and 
farming and it&rsquo;s stupid to think they stopped evolving to their diet as 
soon as they got cows.</p> 
<p>Now, if you really are a descendant of a hunter-gatherer society that had a 
fully-formed agricultural system thrust on them suddenly and less than 500 
years ago, you should absolutely try out a paleolithic diet. You also probably 
are lactose-intolerant and prone to obesity because your ancestors never gained 
the genes needed to tolerate modern food. But I know most of the paleolithic 
diet supporters did NOT descend from those groups; they are well-evolved to eat 
whole and stone-ground grains, honey, beer and malted grains, fermented 
everything, vegetable and seed oils, milk, cheese, and yogurt.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;My suspicion that many skeptics are anti environmentalists is being 
strengthened&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Funny, I&rsquo;m in a college class on conservation biology and community 
ecology, where we are currently learning about the history of the conservation 
movement and efforts to save biodiversity. The forerunners of every major 
discovery or advancement in conservation and REAL environmentalism (ie, out in 
the field actually fighting for it with science to back them up, not buying 
&ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; toilet paper) have all been practical, down-to-earth 
sorts who abhor fundamentalism and all double as professional skeptics.</p> 
<p>The thing is, the most important thing in environmentalism is LAND. The 
unadulterated kind good for lemurs or buffalo or kangaroos or trees. So 
anything that reduces the amount of land we use for farming is good, unless 
it&rsquo;s dumping more dangerous pesticides and fertilizers (including cow 
manure&ndash; it&rsquo;s also a burden) into the local ecosystems. This 
includes massive deaths of humans, which obviously doctors don&rsquo;t like. It 
does not include organic farming, which is actually a huge problem as it 
requires more land than modern farming and is still dumping stuff into the 
ecosystem that doesn&rsquo;t belong there, like manure.</p> 
<p>Read David Quammen&rsquo;s The Song of the Dodo. He chronicles the history 
of conservation biology and interviews the people who have made such leaps and 
bounds to save biodiversity and save our planet from extinction. My favorite 
was the guy who collected images of the Virgin Mary on food products and had 
made a name for himself by debunking bogus science claims.</p> </li>

<p>Zoe, there are plenty of skeptics and advocates of science who are 
environmentalists and fully able to handle complexity &ndash; there are just a 
subset of people who consider themselves skeptics who are really simply 
reactionary or conflate being scientific with being uncritical of industry, 
technology or what they quaintly call &ldquo;modernity&rdquo;. Of course, 
considering that we&rsquo;re in the post-modern era, the 
&ldquo;modernists&rdquo; are actually simply nostalgic for the past and certain 
traditional &ldquo;modern&rdquo; beliefs and cultural modes from a simpler time 
where they felt more comfortable. Modernism is really pretty quaint and 
simplistic with it&rsquo;s doctors advertising cigarettes and &ldquo;better 
living through chemistry&rdquo;. Not that post-modernism doesn&rsquo;t have its 
technofetishists as well and dreams of a post-human future that are just as 
fantastic as modernism&rsquo;s promises. From my perspective, it would be nice 
if humans finally just got over the fantasies and started to figure out how to 
live on the planet as human animals. Learning from some of our past mistakes 
and actually living in reality might be a good place to start!</p> </li>

<p>What&rsquo;s your evidence to support that populations today have improved 
health from eating grains? If you check several of the studies I&rsquo;ve cited 
here, modern, European-descended populations show improved health on diets 
modeling that of the macronutrient composition of paleolithic tribes.</p> 
<p>I will grant you that some populations are lactose tolerant, but 
that&rsquo;s an easier evolutionary leap since all human infants produce 
lactase, and so selection for individuals who continue to produce lactase 
isn&rsquo;t much of a leap. (See the Masai, for example.) However, as far as I 
can determine, this is not true as far as the consumption of cereal grains go. 
I will grant you that stone-ground, unsifted flours are healthier than modern 
refined flowers, but archaeological comparisons of health belie the claim that 
that cereal grain consumption is health-promoting beyond the mere provision of 
calories. Not to mention studies of modern populations that show health 
benefits of removing cereal grains from the diet completely.</p> </li>

<p>I took a quick look at Dr Hall&rsquo;s post also.</p> 
<p>I noted that 2 of the 11 comments were actually cross-reference comments. 
It&rsquo;s hard to call those either negative or positive.</p> 
<p>1 of the comments was Dr Hall&rsquo;s own response to the request for a

<p>Of the remaining 8, about half were what I would call discussion or 
amplification. In other words, they were not really disagreeing with the theme 
of the blog, but just trying to clarify or point out something that occurred to 
them. So, perhaps 4 or 5 of the posts actually disagreed with Dr Hall.</p> 
<p>Also, I rather liked Dr Hall&rsquo;s blog because it advocated for (and she 
commended Pollan&rsquo;s book for supporting) a more balanced and practical 
approach to nutrition than we typically see in most special diets.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, balanced, practical and reasonable don&rsquo;t typically 
play well in a blog/comment thread.</p>

<p>After reading more of your comments Amy, I have to question your logic.</p> 
<p>You say farmers have been a grand success over hunter-gatherers, but that 
has happened over such a short period of time (10,000 years or less) how can 
you consider that an evolutionary process? Our genes evolved over millions of 
years, not the 10,000 years that power hungry leaders have used farming to 
control the entire world in a very short time.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying if zero-point energy was invented tomorrow and the 
creators ate mainly Twinkies, and were able to use their resources to take over 
the world within several decades, that now Twinkies are the ideal food because 
the zero-pointers have been such a grand success.</p> </li>

<li> # squirrelelite <em>on 19 Feb 2010 at 11:24 pm </em> 
<p>Much of the discussion on this thread (and several of Dr Amy&rsquo;s other 
posts) has amounted to disagreements on the relative importance of quantitative 
factors such as population size, life expectancy, and longevity versus more 
subjective/evaluative factors such as quality of life and overall population 
healthiness as a measure of value or success.</p> 
<p>Although the statistical basis for these quantitative measures is somewhat 
limited and uncertain before the last 2 or 3 hundred years, we can at least 
make an informed estimate for earlier times and compare those.</p> 
<p>When we move to measures like quality of life, the data to support those 
measures becomes more limited and dubious. This may be a bit of an argument 
from ignorance, but I don&rsquo;t know how we can repeatably and reliably 
define the relative quality of sitting around a campfire listening to the 
tribal elders sing songs and tell stories versus reading a book by candlelight 
or entertaining (?!) your friends by playing a tune on a piano versus reading a 
book by electric light and listening to music on or even watching a movie on a 
digital music player.</p> 
<p>However, because we are arguably the most successful species in the last 
several hundred million years at adapting to and exploiting our environment, we 
have survived and expanded from a population of only a few thousand living in a 
small corner of Africa to a population of several billion living or at least 
surviving in practically every environment on this planet and even off of it.
</p> 
<p>As a result, we can no longer rely on mere biological or evolutionary 
pressures to guide us in some &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction.</p> 
<p>Thus, a major issue for all peoples in all countries for the 21st century 
is going to be defining and choosing quality of life as well as sheer longevity 
and trying to find an optimum or at least sustainable balance between quality 
and quantity.</p> 
<p>And, I don&rsquo;t think that arguments that &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way 
we&rsquo;ve been doing it for thousands of years&rdquo; (the traditional 
fallacy) or &ldquo;nature and evolution guided us to do this so it must be 
best&rdquo; (the natural fallacy) will be particularly useful in making that 
choice.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m new to the Science Based Medicine site. For the most part I have 
found the blogs posted on this site to be extremely informative&ndash;I 
currently work at a Planned Parenthood as a reproductive health assistant but 
don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; medical background; for the most part, I 
approach the site as a layman skeptic. Normally, I just check-out the blogs to 
heighten my limited medical knowledge, find good arguments against 
quackery&mdash;which sadly many people I care about deeply engage in&mdash;and 
because I find a lot of comments interesting and fun. I never really thought I 
would ever ended up posting anything.</p> 
<p>However, after reading Dr. Amy Tuteur post, and the numerous comments 
following it, I feel somewhat obligated to speak up. I think it is very 
important for those who carry the flag or reason, skepticism, and science to 
ensure that they don&rsquo;t fall into the same rhetorical pitfalls and 
generally confused thinking that we purpose to be against. The post by Dr. 
Tuteur I found a bit upsetting because it seemed to duplicate many of the 
things that we are supposing against. Specifically, there are three rhetorical 
mishaps that weakens her case.</p> 
<p>First is the use of generalizations. Dr. Amy Tuteur refers often to 
alternative health without really describing what she is talking about or who 
she is addressing. The phrase &ldquo;alternative health&rdquo; covers a lot of 
things&mdash;some of them are science-based and some are not. I thought the 
whole point of saying that we were using science-based medicine is to break out 
of the false dichotomy of alternative vs conventional health. Working in an 
abortion clinic, and talking to the doctors there, I find many examples of wide 
spread &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; health practices&mdash;like the practice of 
some doctors of requiring women to have a pap smear before prescribing them 
birth control or telling women who are over 26 years old that they are 
&ldquo;too old&rdquo; for for the HPV vaccine even though they have only just 
recently decided to become sexually active&mdash;that are not based in science, 
common sense, or even care. Science based medicine, as I understand it&mdash;is 
not concern who practicing, but what they are practicing. It doesn&rsquo;t 
matter if it is conventional wisdom or alternative wisdom&mdash;it just matters 
if it is wise.</p> 
<p>Second the use of straw-man arguments. Not everyone who is critical or 
modern medicine and modern agriculture is a romantic primitivist who thinks we 
should go back to the stone age. For example, the Union of Concerned 
Scientists&mdash;a very rational, caring, and science-based 
organization&mdash;has been critical of modern agricultural practices, like the 
use of pesticides, for years. For them the question isn&rsquo;t has pesticide 
use increased food production and lead to a higher standard of living (the 
answer is of course yes), the question is could we still have an even higher 
standard of living through the use of organic practices with our knowledge of 
agriculture, ecology, and sustainable development? There conclusions are yes, 
and people are welcome to check out their website to make-up their own mind on 
the matter:http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/ Similarly, there are 
many examples of modern medical practices that were thought to be safe by some 
that later on turned out to be harmful, or drugs that had immoral and poor 
testing history. Examples that I am aware of from my work are IUD use in the 
1970s, and some of the more tragic elements of the non-consensual testing 
involving Depo-Provera. As one commenter pointed out a &ldquo;great deal of 
&lsquo;bemoaning the current state of American health&rsquo; is being done by 
medical experts and doctors.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And finally, the use of ad hominem attacks. I know it is easy to for all of 
us to label many of those who practice alternative medicine as quacks, cranks, 
irrational buffoons, or&ndash;as Dr. Tuteur does in her 
article&ndash;&rdquo;fundamentalist&rdquo; but to do so targets are energy on 
the people and not their ideas. It does us no good to form our arguments in 
such as way as to read: alternative health advocates claim pesticides are bad 
and modern diseases are caused by the environment, alternative health advocates 
are stupid, therefore pesticides are good and modern disease can&rsquo;t be 
avoid only cured. I sincerely trust that Dr. Tuteur doesn&rsquo;t actually 
believe that argument, but they way she structured her comments it is 
definitely reasonable to walk-in with that understanding. For example her 
statement that people living in the modern world &ldquo;still prey to the same 
illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated&rdquo; just 
isn&rsquo;t true. A few weeks ago on the Skeptic Guide to Universe, Steve 
Novella commented on the dangers of living in an environmental that was too 
sterile, and how people living in the developing world may have an edge over us 
because their bodies develop more antibodies and have less examples of 
incidents of allergies. In some ways, modern industrialize living comes with 
complications.</p> 
<p>Perhaps though, I was so moved to write something because of the comments I 
read in reply to the post (and in replies to some of those replies), because of 
the general direction I fear skepticism is going in. I think Carl Sagan was 
very wise in cautioning skeptics of taking a tone that was too polemic, 
judgmental, and just plain wrong. At one point in his life, he refused to sign 
a statement that condemn the influence of astrology on astronomers because he 
thought the tone of the statement was too harsh and condensing. I think this 
was a very, and dare I say it&mdash;scientific&mdash;decision. In my opinion 
good scientists is passionate about what they know, and ecstatic about what 
they don&rsquo;t know. In practical sense, this means defending your position, 
without putting down those against you, because even if their arguments are not 
true, there may be some truth to what they are saying.</p> 
<p>Personally, this is something I need to practice on a daily basis, so it 
frustrates me when fellow skeptics take it for granted. I know that most of you 
probably deal with a lot of people who have some fairly wacky ideas of medicine 
at a distance&mdash;I am not so lucky. Many people I love and care deeply about 
have chosen to not vaccine their children, go to naturopathic doctors, any use 
homeopathics. Through experience, I find that trying to beat people over the 
head with the information never works. Instead, I find the only thing that does 
work is the really humanist thing&mdash;have patience, accept them for where 
they are at, give people empathy, and most importantly appeal to there reason, 
not your judgments of them. Telling people that you are concern about some of 
their healthcare choices, and then give them the reasons why, goes a lot 
farther than just telling them that their doctor is a quack, their medicine is 
garbage, and that they are just a backwards looking fundamentalist for thinking 
so.</p> 
<p>I know a certain degree of sarcasm, heckling, and ridicule is unavoidable, 
necessary, and lets be honest a little fun. But I do think it takes a lot more 
attention from skeptics then it needs to, or is healthy, and I worry about the 
environment that it creates for us. As some of the other comments mentioned, it 
makes no more sense to romanticize the past as it does the present. History 
travels in veins, often dividing in making directions. Sometimes progress in 
one area of life, leads to regression in another. By that same token skepticism 
is just one side of the coin. It does have much value with out certainty in 
something else. It doesn&rsquo;t do any could to always be skeptical of fringe 
ideas and always being accepting of conventional ideas and vice versa.</p> 
<p>I think at all cost we should avoid making some to the rhetorical pitfalls 
I mentioned above, and put more attention on laying out the facts and making 
reasoned focused arguments. After all, the foundation of science as a 
philosophy is that people have the potential to be highly rational creatures. 
It is important for us to put that believe into practice.</p> </li>

lol. But Dr. Tuteur seems to claim that ALL pesticides have saved lives 
(indirectly of course), which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. She 
doesn&rsquo;t make disclaimers, even after repeated requests for clarification. 
From the little I&rsquo;ve read (which is far more than the average person, but 
probably not as much as the commenters here), organic farming has pluses and 
minuses. I like that Michael Pollan (and I did like Dr. Hall&rsquo;s article on 
it, but that confirmation bias is very powerful!) points out the disadvantages 
of organic farming, the big corporate organic farms, and the fact that organic 
DOES USE potentially dangerous pesticides, just not synthetic ones. But the 
more I read, the more I conclude that there are not easy answers, despite a few 
&ldquo;expert&rdquo; bloggers who insist there are. In my field (education) 
this is certainly true, and I find it hard to believe that medicine/diet is a 
lot different. It does seem to be the more libertarian skeptics who claim to be 
unconvinced by global warming, DDT/malaria links, recycling, the existence of 
toxins/ environmental pollutants etc etc etc. Of course, there are liberals on 
the other side who believe everything they read if it fits in their worldview.

 &ldquo;From my perspective, it would be nice if humans finally 
just got over the fantasies and started to figure out how to live on the planet 
as human animals. Learning from some of our past mistakes and actually living 
in reality might be a good place to start!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It occured to me as well that the extremist skeptic backlash against 
*anything* natural was a response to being compared to animals, since, guess 
what, that&rsquo;s what we are. Certainly, in the historic nature vs. 
science/technology debate, people couldn&rsquo;t stand being compared to 
animals, and there are certainly some religious undertones there.</p> 
<p>I think I mentioned this in a comment that is currently being held in 
moderation, but as someone with a background in history and education, I have a 
hard time with the idea that there is nothing we can learn from the past. There 
is no other time I would like to live in than the present (especially 
considering sexism and racism!), but modern technology isn&rsquo;t perfect 
either. Again, extremists on both sides.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;When we move to measures like quality of life, the data to support 
those measures becomes more limited and dubious. This may be a bit of an 
argument from ignorance, but I don&rsquo;t know how we can repeatably and 
reliably define the relative quality of sitting around a campfire &rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, but we can look at the number of people starving and STILL dying of 
infectious disease around the world. Sheer population may be a measure of 
success in a limited evolutionary sense, but I think quality of life matters 
too. I don&rsquo;t really know what percentage of the 6 plus billion people on 
this planet have a horrible quality of life, but it would be interesting to 
find out. I&rsquo;m sure that somebody will point out that they&rsquo;d still 
rather be alive and that&rsquo;s all that matters, but I&rsquo;m not sure. At 
the least, I abhor the Catholic restrictions on birth control (for example).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read that agriculture has been around for about 10,000 
years, while H. sapiens have been around for 100,000 years, and we branched off 
from chimps 5 million years ago. So agriculture has been a very small 
percentage of our history. Is it always a naturalistic fallacy to consider 
human evolution as a driving factor in medicine? What are some example of 
fallacy versus logically sound? I&rsquo;ve also read that evolution can also 
happen very fast. Is is possible that the human body has adapted already to a 
grain based or meat based diet, in those 10,000 years? People from around the 
world have subsisted on varied diets throughout history it seems.</p> </li>

<p>There is a tragic but very interesting genetic disease that supports the 
statement by Dr Tuteur, &ldquo;That both cancer and heart disease are among the 
primary causes of death today represents a victory, not a defeat. Diseases of 
old age &hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The disease is Werner&rsquo;s syndrome, premature senescence developing in 
the 20&prime;s. This reference is to a GeneReviews summary of the disease, 
authors Dru F Leistritz, MS, et al (I&rsquo;m not sure of the proper citation)
</p> 
<p>www URL:</p> 
<p> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&amp;part=werner</p>
<p>The quote from the review I wish to discuss is; </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Disease characteristics. Werner syndrome is characterized by the 
premature appearance of features associated with normal aging and cancer 
predisposition. Individuals with Werner syndrome develop normally until the end 
of the first decade. The first sign is the lack of a growth spurt during the 
early teen years. Early findings (usually observed in the 20s) include loss and 
graying of hair, hoarseness, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by 
bilateral ocular cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, skin 
ulcers, and osteoporosis in the 30s. Myocardial infarction and cancer are the 
most common causes of death, typically at about age 48 years. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is a disease in which the natural course of life is altered by a 
mutation in the Wrn gene (obviously so named because of the investigation into 
Werner&rsquo;s syndrome). This gene apparently encodes a protein active in DNA 
metabolism. Mutations in the gene tend to be associated with loss of integrity 
of the individual cells&rsquo; genome. The loss of integrity is the proposed 
mechanism of aging.</p> 
<p>The higher incidence of cancers and ischemic heart disease in the typically 
reduced lifespan of Werner&rsquo;s patients is supporting evidence for Dr 
Tuteur&rsquo;s statement that these are diseases of aging. If the genomical 
aging of an individual is accelerated, then the diseases tend to occur at an 
earlier chronological age. Of course, the cause and rate of progression of 
disease such as diabetes, cancer, and atherosclerosis are multifactorial, but 
the observations of the natural course of Werner&rsquo;s favors the process of 
aging as being a significant factor in the development of those diseases. We 
tend to talk much about the factors of diet, exercise, and smoking, because 
those are factors we can change. If we could intervene in the 60 year old and 
give them the genomic integrity of a 20 year old by gene therapy, then maybe we 
wouldn&rsquo;t waste so much time trying to convince the patient to eat 
healthier, get more exercise, and stop smoking. Maybe Woody Allen&rsquo;s 
prediction for future medical science in &ldquo;Sleeper&rdquo; will yet come to 
pass.</p> 
<p>On a side note, I am well aware of the scientific evidence that severe 
dietary restriction slows down aging, that is a separate issue.</p> 
<p>While we can blame some of the increase in incidence of cancer and heart 
disease on modern diet and life style, some of the increase must be attributed 
to the greater longevity we currently enjoy. I can&rsquo;t estimate the 
relative strength of the factors, but the study of Werner&rsquo;s syndrome 
suggests that aging is a stronger factor than what our beliefs (even after 
medical training) would suggest.</p> 
<p>On another note, there is a difference in CAM using concepts of science 
(and thus claiming common ground with SBM), and SBM which uses methods of 
science in addition to scientific concepts. CAM proponents often ignore the 
issue of scaling when proposing scientific basis for treatment. Here are two 
examples of issues of scaling in science. How can we scale the concepts of 
quantum mechanics to predictions of what will we observe in a chemical reaction 
in a test tube? That is partly addressed by statistical mechanics. How we can 
scale what happens in the test tube to what happens in an organism is an even 
more complex problem. This is where we have to back up hypotheses with more 
evidence. Proponents of CAM often ignore the problems of scaling. I have even 
seen some explanations of benefit of a homeopathic treatment based on quantum 
mechanical principles. Sounds great&hellip; when I see quantum extinction of an 
individual, I&rsquo;ll hurry to see that homeopath.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if you really are a descendant of a hunter-gatherer society 
that had a fully-formed agricultural system thrust on them suddenly and less 
than 500 years ago, you should absolutely try out a paleolithic diet. You also 
probably are lactose-intolerant and prone to obesity because your ancestors 
never gained the genes needed to tolerate modern food. But I know most of the 
paleolithic diet supporters did NOT descend from those groups; they are 
well-evolved to eat whole and stone-ground grains, honey, beer and malted 
grains, fermented everything, vegetable and seed oils, milk, cheese, and 
yogurt.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>While you display impressive insight from what I typically see as a paleo 
blogger (the fist part of the para), you seem a bit unconcerned or perhaps 
ignorant of the possibility of a spectrum.</p> 
<p>For instance, are there only celiacs and those perfectly adapted to gluten?
</p> 
<p>So, I agree that evolution marches on. Everyone feel free to do their part 
for future generations (where do you hear _that_ all the time?).</p> 
<p>While I doubt I&rsquo;m celiac, and I do seem to tolerate lactose in 
reasonable quantity, I have a brother with mild chron&rsquo;s. And me, if I eat 
grains, I very soon have pretty strong nasal congestion.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal. Paleo is a good baseline starting place. 
Doesn&rsquo;t need to be your ending place. I often write that 
&ldquo;paleo&rdquo; is Kitaval to Inutit (70% starchy carb to near 0% carb) and 
everything in between.</p> 
<p>I suspect that a lower carb via starch is probably more suited to most. But 
eat real food and through self-experimentation, figure out what works for you.
</p> 
<p>I know peer reviewed research is big around here and good. But I trust my 
own results far more. For example, I wanted to see about fasting workouts, so I 
tested BG prior, at 24 hours fast (80s). Then I pushed big weights for 30 
minutes and tested again: 105. Gluconeogenesis. It really works.</p>

<p>JMB,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that a genetic disorder completely supports the 
hypothesis of heart disease, diabetes and cancer being merely &ldquo;diseases 
of age.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know very much about Werner&rsquo;s syndrome, but 
I did find it interesting that part of the recommended course of treatment was 
diet and exercise.</p> 
<p>I think I would have to offer as a counterpoint to your evidence the ample 
studies indicating that the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer 
are very low among population groups that follow a traditional H-G diet 
compared to similar populations that consume a modern, Western diet.</p> 
<p>Still, I&rsquo;d be interested to see some dietary studies on the 
sufferer&rsquo;s of Werner&rsquo;s syndrome to see if any particular 
macronutrient compositions help or hinder treatment. I would hypothesize that 
because Werner&rsquo;s patients suffer from Type II Diabetes and ischemic heart 
disease that they would benefit from the diets used in the Lindeberg and 
Jonsson studies I cite above. I could, of course, be wrong because the nature 
of the genetic disorder might complicate matters.</p> </li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone is suggesting those diseases are 
&ldquo;merely&rdquo; diseases of old age, but they do clearly increase in 
incidence with age.</p> 
<p>Arteriosclerosis has been found in Egyptian mummies. I don&rsquo;t know how 
one would classify the ancient Egyptian diet, but it sure wasn&rsquo;t 
equivalent to the modern Western diet. I&rsquo;m guessing that in every 
society, with every kind of diet, no matter how low the baseline incidence of 
ischemic heart disease and diabetes, the incidence of both increases with age. 
I&rsquo;m guessing that although diet and lifestyle modification can 
drastically reduce the incidence of those diseases, it can&rsquo;t entirely 
eradicate them. Does anyone have evidence that my guesses are wrong?</p> </li>

<p>Sorry to veer off topic again&hellip;Harriet said &ldquo;Why is it that 
people complain so much about Dr. Tuteur but do not complain equally about me? 
It seems to me that we are being treated differently, and I don&rsquo;t 
understand why.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In light of Harriet&rsquo;s comments and after mulling over why another 
commenter&rsquo;s point about the importance of &ldquo;finding bloggers you can 
trust, as long as you don&rsquo;t trust them absolutely&rdquo; struck a chord 
with me I have a comment regarding blogging style and why it&rsquo;s important 
for sbm. Harriet&rsquo;s comment to this post on Feb 18 at 12:49 pm sums up the 
differences between Harriet and Amy.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Amy, while I agree with your main points, I have to question one 
statement you made: &ldquo;All the existing scientific evidence shows that all 
of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false.&rdquo; [Harriet 
omitted Amy&rsquo;s further emphasis &ldquo;None of it works, absolutely none 
of it.&rdquo;] I think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing 
scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no CAM treatment 
works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably 
work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of 
pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve analyzed the two different styles here, though I don&rsquo;t 
think Harriet and Amy are saying exactly the same thing as Amy appears to 
dismiss even the placebo effects of alternative medicine.</p> 
<p>Harriet&rsquo;s &ldquo;PBS Newshour&rdquo; version: educational, mature, 
reasoned opinion (points for factual, useful information)<br>
 balanced, 
objective, science based opinion</p> 
<p>Is this source honest? probably<br>
 Can I trust this source? seems likely
<br> Is this source overtly biased or dogmatic? doesn&rsquo;t appear so<br>
 
Have I learned anything of value? yes<br>
 Have I wasted my time? Probably not
</p> 
<p>Amy&rsquo;s &ldquo;fox news&rdquo; version: unnecessarily loud and 
sensationalized (possible points for entertainment value)<br>
 Unbalanced, 
biased, exaggerated personal opinion</p> 
<p>Is this source honest? Not sure<br>
 Can I trust this source? Don&rsquo;t 
know<br>
 Is this source overtly biased or dogmatic? possibly<br>
 Have I 
learned anything of value? not really<br>
 Have I wasted my time? perhaps</p> 
<p>Chalk it up to a matter of personal taste, but in a purportedly science 
based venue it&rsquo;s food for thought.</p> </li>

<p>While there are obvious benefits from eating a diet that consists of more 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, it does appear that 
longevity and resistance to cardiovascular disease and dementia have a very 
strong genetic component to them.</p> 
<p>This debate has been very interesting. </p> 
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in any other time, and having 
followed a very rigorous paleolithic diet numerous times for sport 
competitions, I must admit, life really isn&rsquo;t worth living unless you can 
have Belgian pralines on occasion.</p> 
<p> </p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 20 Feb 2010 at 6:45 am </em> 
<p>To further clarify: Further downthread from Harriet&rsquo;s comment Amy 
agrees with Harriet&rsquo;s correction of the accuracy of her statements! So is 
Amy now on the record for changing from &ldquo;none of it works, absolutely 
none of it&rdquo; to admitting that CAM can be as effective as placebo and that 
some herbal treatments are actually more effective than placebo? To what do we 
attribute this about-face? Schizophrenia? Confusion? Change of heart? I think 
I&rsquo;ve made my point about trustworthiness of source.</p> </li> 
<li> # BillyJoe <em>on 20 Feb 2010 at 8:43 am </em> 
<p>wales,</p> 
<p>Amy agreed with Harriet&rsquo;s definition because it is the same as hers. 
It&rsquo;s just that her&rsquo;s is the hyperbolic short version and 
Harriet&rsquo;s is the more accurate long version</p> 
<p>Amy&rsquo;s hyperbolic short version:<br>
 &ldquo;All the existing 
scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health 
are flat out false. None of it works, absolutely none of it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Harriet&rsquo;s more accurate long version:<br>
 &ldquo;All the existing 
scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no CAM treatment 
works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably 
work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of 
pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>They are saying essentially the same thing:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;No better than placebo&rdquo; means &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t 
work&rdquo;.<br>
 But, yeah, some herbs may work, but you wouldn&rsquo;t use 
them in preference to pharmacological preparations with their standard and 
guaranteed amounts of active ingredient, no unnecessary stuff added in, and no 
potentially harmful contaminants inadvertantly or deliberately added (to be 
even more accurate)</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s just a difference in style.<br>
 Short and to the point versus 
long-winded but more accurate.<br>
 I think both styles are fine, you just have 
to recognise each for what it is.</p>

<p>Harriet asks why my posts provoke such a strong reaction. I have been 
writing on the Internet for 15 years and have evoked similar reactions in 
certain quarters for much of that time. I&rsquo;ve had a great deal of time to 
think about the issue and I consider it to be straight forward: the most 
vociferous commenters feel threatened.</p> 
<p>My provocative posts are provocative because they challenge cherished 
wisdom. There is a lot of wishful thinking at the heart of conventional wisdom 
about health. Even some people who believe in SBM insist that they have more 
control over their health than they could possibly have. They are sure that 
they can prevent getting cancer and heart disease if they simply eat 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; and exercise. And they are equally convinced that CAD and 
type 2 diabetes are the modern equivalent of the Black Death.</p> 
<p>A lot of what I write challenges those cherished beliefs of control and the 
comforting illusion that those who are ill have brought it on themselves and 
for some that is intolerable.</p> 
<p>My writing on childbirth challenges a different but equally cherish bit of 
wishful thinking, the notion that women who make the &ldquo;right&rdquo; 
choices are better mothers and more authentic women than those who choose 
differently. When I challenge the myths about &ldquo;natural&rdquo; 
chchildbirth, homebirth and breastfeeding, I am threatening some people&rsquo;s 
deeply held beliefs about themselves and that is intolerable.</p> 
<p>Of course it is possible to disagree with my arguments on the basis of 
scientific facts and reasoning and some people do. However those who come after 
me repeatedly, who can&rsquo;t resist the personal attacks, are fighting to 
hold on to cherished beliefs about themselves, not for scientific integrity.</p>
<p>Someone commented upthread that I generally don&rsquo;t take attacks 
personally and that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s because I think that the most 
vociferous commenters are not attacking me personally; they are fighting to 
hold onto deeply cherished opinions about themselves.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 20 Feb 2010 at 9:17 am </em> 
<p>BillyJoe &ndash; The problem is that some of the claims made about specific 
alternative medicine treatments have been true (not many but some, and they now 
more or less own the diet and exercise territory in the public eye&hellip;and 
let&rsquo;s face it, diet and exercise are good treatments for many common 
ailments). Sure we can play the &ldquo;once it&rsquo;s been proven by science 
it&rsquo;s not alternative medicine it&rsquo;s scientific medicine&rdquo; 
gambit but there&rsquo;s quite a bit of intellectual dishonesty in not 
recognizing that the claims for efficacy were once made by alternative health 
practitioners. The reason why people keep going back to alternative health 
practitioners is that bits of it can work &ndash; not to cure cancer or AIDS of 
course, but certainly to help make people feel better or get into shape or make 
a necessary life change. I, of course, make a distinction between a cure and 
simply making someone subjectively feel better but it&rsquo;s worth remembering 
what the patient is actually seeking&hellip;which is often to simply feel 
better or be supported in some way. I&rsquo;m also an advocate of people 
understanding why something is working for them &ndash; being cognitively 
literate and self aware, or aware that something is actually a drug &ndash; and 
not presenting it as magic or harmless because its made from a plant. And 
obviously people who are simply conning a sick person are charlatans and should 
be strung up for exploiting the vulnerable.</p> 
<p>Also, saying that the placebo effect means &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t 
work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accurate and is overly simplistic &ndash; particularly 
when talking about something as subjective as treatments for pain or 
depression. (The areas where a placebo effect is the most profound and 
confounding for studies.) If a placebo is relieving someone&rsquo;s pain or 
depression it is working since the end goal of any treatment for pain or 
depression is to relieve pain or depression. What it indicates is that the 
actual drug may not work in the way anticipated and be no better than a placebo.

<p>I agree with your point about quality of life for as many people as 
possible being important. I think I was trying to get to that but perhaps I 
should have been more loquacious. Anyway, evolution may work to select genes 
that can survive, propagate and reproduce but for humans in the 21st century 
just generating greater numbers of humans is not going to be good enough. We 
will need to find a way to provide greater quality of life for a greater 
fraction of the overall population (mere fairness) under long term stable 
conditions (environmental concerns).</p> 
<p>Also, I woke up this morning listening to two episodes from NPR&rsquo;s 
Science Friday podcast which seem pertinent to this discussion.</p> 
<p>The first one, from a study of dolphins working with the U.S. Navy in San 
Diego Bay, discovered that dolphins in a &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; state, i.e. just 
eating a few fish, go into a diabetic-like high blood sugar state to allow the 
liver to provide the blood sugar needed to support a large brain. Or, as the 
NPR web site describes it:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Chimps and mice are the usual test subjects scientists study when 
they want to learn about the human body. But could we learn something about 
humans by studying the physiology of marine mammals a such as dolphins? In this 
segment, live from the annual meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science in San Diego, we&rsquo;ll talk with researchers who are 
doing just that. Some researchers are studying a sort of natural &ldquo;on-off 
switch&rdquo; for diabetes in dolphins in hopes of learning more about human 
diabetes. We&rsquo;ll also talk about how viruses infect humans and dolphins 
&mdash; what happens when a dolphin gets a cold? Could viruses pass between 
dolphins and humans?</p>

 &rdquo;<br>
 So, (this is quite preliminary and speculative) 
our ancestors may have evolved the ability to go into a diabetic state to 
provide sufficient blood sugar for a large brain despite the vagaries of a 
paleolithic or even pre-paleolithic diet. What has changed with the modern diet 
is not the diabetic state itself but something that affects our body&rsquo;s 
ability to control when it goes into or comes out of that state.</p> 
<p>Here is the link:</p> 
<p>http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201002193</p> 
<p>The other segment which you can easily navigate to from the first link is 
about studying epilepsy in sea lions caused by harmful algal blooms (which 
affected a large number of people in Canada several years ago when they ate 
some bad mussels from Prince Edward Island). Evidently, a toxin in the algal

<p>&ldquo;Also, saying that the placebo effect means &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t 
work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accurate and is overly simplistic &rdquo;</p> 
<p>It means that what is &ldquo;working&rdquo; is the placebo effect itself,

<p>Marco &ndash; Great post (though I&rsquo;ll admit to a confirmation bias 
since I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Carl Sagans, Ramachandrans and Sacks who are 
both great scientitsts and great communicators&hellip;writers who clearly care 
much more deeply about people and communication, as well as what they write 
about, than about their own egos). I really do appreciate the SBM bloggers here 
who clearly love science for what it is and want to communicate just how cool 
it is to the general public. Dr Crislip&rsquo;s posts are funny, incredibly 
informative and help people to understand how science works. Dr Val Jones is 
down to earth, easy to read and clearly interested in actually creating 
understanding and reaching out in a friendly way. Dr Gorski and Dr Novella also 
do a good job of explaining complex topics and taking on specific advocates of 
unscientific nonsense. I don&rsquo;t always agree with them about everything 
political/social/philosophical but I can respect them as being genuine in their 
intent and simply having a different perspective. Difference makes the world 
interesting and it&rsquo;s worth remaining open to and curious about different 
perspectives rather than constantly seeking to affirm our own. They can also 
both openly admit when they&rsquo;ve made an error of ommision or fact &ndash; 
though Dr Crislip&rsquo;s recent post is still one of my favorites I&rsquo;ve 
read here. It may not have generated much controversy or debate but 
that&rsquo;s because it was so well written, humble and non-sensationalist 
&ndash; even though it was dealing with a potentially controversial topic 
&ndash; there was no bullsh*t to call him out on and no sloppy language and 
vagueness about meaning. What was there to say other than &ldquo;great post, 
thanks!&rdquo; </p> </li>

<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; &ldquo;My provocative posts are provocative because they 
challenge cherished wisdom.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the story you like to tell yourself. However, I find your 
posts annoying to read because of the reasons Marco outlined above and because 
you&rsquo;re a sloppy, sensationalist writer and entirely unreflective about 
your own biases and clearly have a lot of self worth and ego tied up in this 
image of yourself as a provocateur and &ldquo;challenger&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; &rdquo; There is a lot of wishful thinking at the heart 
of conventional wisdom about health. Even some people who believe in SBM insist 
that they have more control over their health than they could possibly have. 
They are sure that they can prevent getting cancer and heart disease if they 
simply eat &ldquo;right&rdquo; and exercise. And they are equally convinced 
that CAD and type 2 diabetes are the modern equivalent of the Black 
Death.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Some people may believe this and you certainly believe that others believe 
this whether they do or not. I don&rsquo;t believe this at all, diseases happen 
due to all kinds of reasons outside of our control and we certainly inherit 
genetic vulnerabilities. However, we simply don&rsquo;t have conclusive 
evidence about how much disease genesis is genetic and how much is 
environmental for many forms of cancer so making grand claims about not having 
any control is simply not warranted either. Clearly we do have some control 
over some aspects of our health so it makes sense to practice preventative 
medicine of various kinds. Not everyone is as absolutist as you are Dr Tuteur, 
nor do we all see things in the extremely black and white terms you do. 
That&rsquo;s you projecting your own absolutist stance onto everyone else that 
you&rsquo;re actually seeing when you interact with others!</p> 
<p>For my part, if you weren&rsquo;t blogging at SBM more frequently than any 
other blogger here, I&rsquo;d ignore you as another crank on the internet 
who&rsquo;s simply being sensationalist and attention seeking, and abusing 
science to prop up their own ego and personal identity. (I did find it 
interesting that you seem to make a habit of attacking other bloggers in their 
comment sections so you seek out adversarial interaction rather than discussion 
or any form of constructive or positive interaction.) Because this is SBM and 
because you&rsquo;re engaged in a form of cargo cult SBM blogging and I find it 
worth speaking up. Mainly because I used to like to send people here to educate 
themselves about science and medicine and you&rsquo;re like the anti-Carl Sagan 
&ndash; you&rsquo;re guaranteed to turn off the general public and you make SBM 
look like an ideology that&rsquo;s uncritically pro-industry and Big Pharma 
rather than equally critical and looking out for the public good.</p> </li>

<p>Dr. Tuteur, you might want to try writing for a non-internet (print)

<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; I started reading and commenting long before you started 
blogging here. I like this site and many of the bloggers and I&rsquo;m 
passionate about science in medicine (and I enjoy discussing things with many 
of the commenters here too). I care about SBM so I comment when I see it being 
abused and misrepresented by anyone &ndash; advocates of CAM, cargo cult 
science bloggers such as yourself who use all the same fallacies and techniques 
as advocates of CAM, and shills for Big Pharma or Big sCAM. I don&rsquo;t feel 
threatened by what you write &ndash; as much as you want to believe this about 
yourself all you do when you repeat this is highlight how much your ego is 
wrapped up in this image of yourself and how you project onto others so much 
that you can&rsquo;t hear or see what is being written (and are incapable of 
being self reflective). Really, your narcissism, grandiosity and outright 
evangelicism is pretty spectacular! The only person who&rsquo;s desperate to 
believe that you&rsquo;ve got something of substance to offer and are teaching 
everyone a lesson they &ldquo;need&rdquo; to learn is you. You seem pretty 
proud not to have learned anything in your 15 years of blogging and pretty 
narcissistically engaged with using SBM as a soapbox to affirm your personal 
identity. It&rsquo;s just sad and it&rsquo;s detrimental to actually getting 
anyone to respect or trust SBM (not that you actually care about that since 
it&rsquo;s all about ego for you).</p> </li>

<p>What is egotistical about pointing out that people can feel threatened by 
something that challenges cherished beliefs about themselves, including the 
belief that they have more control over their health than they actually do?</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s really at the heart of the disagreement on this thread. You 
(and others) really, really, really want to believe that if you eat 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; and exercise you will avoid getting ill.</p> 
<p>Be honest. You personally practice the diet that you advocate because you 
think you are protecting yourself. You are defending the paleo diet because you 
have a personal stake in the argument. If my claims in this piece and the 
subsequent comment thread are correct, you&rsquo;re not doing much of anything 
for your health by following your diet, and you just might get CAD or cancer 
anyway. That&rsquo;s what I mean by feeling threatened.</p> </li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow a paleo diet. I eat a relatively sensible diet and get 
regular exercise like my GP mom taught me but I also eat cake and icecream 
(sometimes for breakfast). I eat what I eat because it tastes good and I feel 
good when I get proper nutrition. I also find exercise has all kinds of 
benefits but I certainly don&rsquo;t think it will prevent me from getting 
cancer or AIDS or being hit by a bus or is magic. You&rsquo;re continually 
projecting onto others Dr Tuteur because in your world anyone who disagrees 
with you must be the black to your self imagined white. You rail on about 
fundamentalists but continually reveal yourself as being someone who thinks 
like a fundamentalist in black and white, 
you&rsquo;re-either-with-me-or-against-me terms. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re 
being called out on, along with your appeals to emotion and personal biases

project so heavily onto anyone who disagrees with you or disrupts your self

<p>I did not say that you were an egotistical monster&ndash;I said that that 
that statement made it sound like you were. I was trying to give you a friendly

<p>But I would add that while challenging cherished beliefs is all well and

believe that such challenges should be backed up with the best available 
research.</p>

data to support this opinion.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Be honest. You personally practice the diet that you advocate because you

<p>I believe that by eating a diet that mimics the macronutrient composition 
of hunter-gatherer groups that yes, I will see lowered risk factors for heart 
disease, diabetes, and cancer. I believe this because there is a<i>lot</i> of 
peer-reviewed research that provides data to support this position. Speaking 
for myself personally, since I adopted this manner of eating, I have lost a 
significant amount of weight, my LDL levels have gone down, my fasting glucose 
has gone down, and my blood pressure has gone down.</p>

unable to back up your claims with any peer-reviewed research.</p>

<p>I might die in a car crash even if I wear my seatbelt, but wearing a 
seatbelt certainly lowers the risk, so I wear one.</p>

<p>I am no more threatened by you than I am threatened by my neighbor who 
insisted to me that I&rsquo;m going to Hell because I haven&rsquo;t been saved. 
That&rsquo;s because neither you nor he can provide any evidence to back up 
their claims.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 20 Feb 2010 at 1:26 pm </em> 
<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; Perhaps you think everyone else feels threatened because 
you feel threatened? I certainly don&rsquo;t feel threatened by science or 
medicine, it&rsquo;s what I grew up with and I have a very realistic 
perspective on it (both medicine and doctors are fallible and our understanding 
is constantly evolving &ndash; think critically here too and know your own body 
and family history..the basic stuff). However, I do feel that ideologues are a 
direct threat to science, medicine and reality-based thinking &ndash; 
it&rsquo;s apparently a perspective that some SBM bloggers share. In a small 
way, I do feel sort of personally threatened by ideologues in the sense that 
ideologues that ascend to power may try to impinge upon societal liberties now 
in place and eventually my personal freedom. This is partly because I&rsquo;m 
old enough to remember a time when many people didn&rsquo;t have social 
freedoms we now tend to take for granted (and having known some survivors of 
the Holocaust). I do find fascism &ndash; both personal and political something 
worth speaking up about. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a libertarian or 
such, it just means I prefer living in reality and having personal freedom. I 
do see you as an ideologue and as being very reactionary and unable to be 
self-critical or take any form of criticism and I do see this as being 
detrimental to SBM and influencing public opinion. However, you&rsquo;re not a 
personal threat in any way and basically serve as a distraction (in the same 
way Pec used to here when she used to comment, you remind me of a reverse 
version of her in many ways).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest that youmay well feel somewhat threatened by CAM (and 
particularly by natural birth advocates) since you keep bringing up being 
threatened and projecting it onto people who obviously aren&rsquo;t threatened 
by what you write (though they may disagree). Unlike you, I don&rsquo;t feel 
threatened by CAM &ndash; even though I don&rsquo;t agree with most of what is 
promote under this label and find some of them downright creepy and dangerous. 
(But then Big Pharma is creepy and dangerous too. That&rsquo;s about commerce 
and not medicine.) Why don&rsquo;t I feel threatened by CAM or science and 
medicine? Because they don&rsquo;t threaten my personal or professional 
identity, nor do they confer status to me or take it away, nor do they 
influence my income in any way. Nor have I built a 15 year blogging 
career/hobby on taking sides or presenting myself as an expert. You have a lot 
invested here vis a vis personal identity and are very often arguing opinion 
and from an emotional perspective.</p> 
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m much more interested in why CAM is so attractive to 
people and what they get out of it (as an atheist I feel the same way about 
religion and faith). I grew up around general medicine, neuroscience and 
psychology so what interests me is the cognitive aspects and what is actually 
going on vis a vis placebo effects. And, how people communicate ideas and about 
medicine. My interest in meditation, nutrition and exercise isn&rsquo;t because 
I&rsquo;m an advocate of CAM. Quite the opposite, I&rsquo;m interested in the 
science around these things and sorting out the wheat (the medicine) from the 
chaff (the made up magical stuff). Quite often the bloggers here touch upon 
these subjects directly or indirectly, and they also usually do very good 
breakdowns of the research done in these areas. Not only that, SBM also 
attracts some interesting commenters and discussions. All of this makes it 
worth coming back and, well, it&rsquo;s interesting watching you act and 
communicate like a CAM promoter and ideologue while claiming to be an SBM 
advocate. What can I say, I enjoy observing people and seeing what makes them 
tick (and tock) and how even advocates of SBM fall prey to cognitive traps when 
they&rsquo;re unaware or in denial of their own humanity.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the belief that if you don&rsquo;t like someone&rsquo;s 
writing style then you don&rsquo;t read what they write!</p> 
<p>I follow another blog that has multiple writers and there some writers I 
automatically scroll past, I don&rsquo;t like their writing style, I 
don&rsquo;t agree with them so I just let it go.</p> 
<p>I want to point out to Alison that she&rsquo;s misrepresented a couple of 
things that Dr. Teteur&rsquo;s said (I&rsquo;m late in saying this because I 
was busy) but Alison is trying to claim that Dr. Teteur said that 
&ldquo;nobody&rdquo; lived to old age.</p> 
<p>When in fact what Dr. Teteur said was &ldquo;most people&rdquo;. </p> 
<p>Another thing that has bugged me is that people started trying to discredit 
Dr. Teteur&rsquo;s statement that life expectancy was 35 years old by showing 
proof that were people who lived to be older than 35.</p> 
<p>She never said &ldquo;and everyone died at age 35&Prime; she said the 
average life expectancy.</p> 
<p>She also said that currently the average life expectancy is 77.7 years. But 
no one tried to discredit that by proving that people live to be more than 77.7 
years old.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s the SAME statement the difference is in the tense and yet people 
seemed to be reading those statements to vastly different ways.</p> 
<p>The other thing I can&rsquo;t understand is people&rsquo;s refusal to 
accept diet is not the only indicator of longevity AND that access to food was 
an issue for hunter gatherers.</p> 
<p>Someone lost a lot of weight on a peleo diet which includes times of 
fasting. That&rsquo;s great, BUT (and this is a huge BUT) you have the ability 
to control access to food in a way that was not available in paleolithic times.
</p> 
<p>H-G had to deal with the fact that their food sources could be unreliable 
for many reasons beyond their control &mdash; plants not bearing enough fruits, 
vegetables, and nuts. Which could be for any number of reasons: drought, too 
much rain, too hot, too cold, frost came too early, frost came to late 
(depending on the climate of where they lived), bad storms damaged fruit as it 
came ripe, storms damaged plants before they could bear fruit. As for animals 
they hunted &mdash; maybe they over hunted one year, or new predators moved in, 
or the animals moved on in search of food.</p> 
<p>H-G faced the very real threat of malnutrition and hunger do to scarcity of 
food as mentioned above.</p> 
<p>Then there are all the other issues: Infection. Someone has tried to argue 
that the H-G were really healthy due to their diet being optimal and so they 
were less prone to infection. I have no idea of that is true, but let&rsquo;s 
say it is.</p> 
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone is going to survive an infection 
(depending on what the infection is). And if there was an issue of food 
scarcity and the people were suffering from malnutrition (which was a real 
possibility) they would have been less likely to fight off infections.</p> 
<p>And there are all kinds of different ways to get infections &mdash; there 
may have been a contagious infection that sweeps through a population, or maybe 
someone is bitten by an animal and gets an infection.</p> 
<p>Which brings me to &mdash; accidents. There all kinds of ways people can 
die from accidents. There&rsquo;s immediate death. Or someone could have an 
accident and there could be internal damage that the H-G couldn&rsquo;t know 
about and the person would die later. Someone could have an accident, get 
wounded, and the wound becomes infected and then they die.</p> 
<p>Animal attacks (immediate death or wounds that cause a slow death), animal 
bites (infections) would also be an issue.</p> 
<p>I know that there have been studies on the isolated modern tribes of 
hunter-gatherers but I can not believe that in all of human history every H-G 
tribe in every part of the world has always been able to eat the optimal diet.

</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m of the belief that it can be healthy to challenge oneself and to 
read more than just what one likes. However, I don&rsquo;t think everyone 
should live by my beliefs or believe or act how I do. The problem with only 
reading people who&rsquo;s style you like or who you know you agree and share a 
perspective with is that it&rsquo;s just feeding a personal confirmation bias. 
I purposely read the writing of people who have different perspectives than me 
and a wide variety of opinions and perspectives other than just those that 
align with mine. Why? Because it gives me insight into other perspectives, it 
sometimes gives me an understanding or provokes thought that changes my 
perspective and even when that&rsquo;s not the case it means I at least have an 
understanding of those I disagree with (and just don&rsquo;t routinely shut out 
anything that may challenge ideas I already hold). The internet is an 
interactive medium so I also interact around what I read. That&rsquo;s not 
everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, of course, and I don&rsquo;t expect it to be. (Of

<p>Fifi,</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Sure we can play the &ldquo;once it&rsquo;s been proven by science 
it&rsquo;s not alternative medicine it&rsquo;s scientific medicine&rdquo;&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Perhaps we should just stop using all those terms: conventional medicine, 
alternative medicine, complementary medicine, and integrative medicine, and 
swap it for evidence-based medicne and non evidence-based medicine.<br>
 No 
this won&rsquo;t happen. So, in lieu of a change in nomenclature, our best 
summary is that alternative medicne does not work, none of it. That&rsquo;s not 
totally accurate but so close to being true that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s quite a bit of intellectual dishonesty in not 
recognizing that the claims for efficacy were once made by alternative health 
practitioners.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>What are claims without evidence though?<br>
 They have never had any 
evidence in support of their claims other than &ldquo;personal 
experience&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s only pure luck when they do get things right 
on the odd occasion.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The reason why people keep going back to alternative health 
practitioners is that bits of it can work&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t know that unless you have the evidence.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;but it&rsquo;s worth remembering what the patient is 
actually seeking&hellip;which is often to simply feel better or be supported in 
some way.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But then why use proven ineffective treatments or even unproven treatments 
to achieve this. Use the thing that&rsquo;s achieving the effect &ndash; 
understanding, empathy, compassion, psychology etc</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Also, saying that the placebo effect means &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t 
work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accurate and is overly simplistic &ndash; If a placebo 
is relieving someone&rsquo;s pain or depression it is working since the end 
goal of any treatment for pain or depression is to relieve pain or depression. 
What it indicates is that the actual drug may not work in the way anticipated 
and be no better than a placebo.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>There is no way round it really. If a drug works no better than placebo, 
that means it doesn&rsquo;t work. Put it another way: Does placebo work? Yes it 
does. Does the drug work? No it doesn&rsquo;t? If you want to deny that, then 
you will have to show an effect of the drug above placebo.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Billy Joe, you honestly don&rsquo;t see a difference between the CAM 
comments that &ldquo;none of it works, absolutely none of it&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;except for some herbal remedies&rdquo;???? If so, then we are speaking 
different languages. I perceive that as a complete about-face.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Because Harriet qualified her comment and, if she had have had even more 
time to be even more precise, she would have qualified it even more (I know 
because, unless I&rsquo;m badly mistaken, I have seen her do so in the past). 
That would have made her comment almost indistinguishable from Amy&rsquo;s.<br>

 To driver this point home &ndash; and both of them can comment if they like 
(hey, that&rsquo;ll test me out!) &ndash; I think both Amy and Harriet would 
agree with the following statement about herbs:</p> 
<p>There is some evidence &ndash; mostly from small trials of short duration 
and doubtful use of controls &ndash; for some potential benefit from herbs in 
some limited conditions, but further studies using rigourously designed, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials are required to 
confirm this. In most cases the herb has either not been tested against 
conventional treatments or has been shown to be less effective than 
conventional treatments. There is also evidence, on the basis of funnel plots, 
of publication bias that could account for most of the percieved benefits of 
herbs. Apart from the question of clinical evidence, the dose of actual active 
ingredient in the herb has been found to vary greatly from batch to batch and 
sometimes there is actually no active ingredient. The effect of the 
&ldquo;inactive&rdquo; ingredients is unknown and could be truely neutral and 
therefore unnecessary, or have presently unknown adverse effects. Herbs are 
often purposefully supplemented by pharmaceutical drugs to enhance their 
effect, or inadvertently contaminated by heavy metals and other toxins which 
make them dangerus to use.</p> 
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t expect complete agreement on every single point, but I 
hiope you see where I am heading.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect we&rsquo;ll get an explanation from 
Amy&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I think Amy has reponded to me on only one occasion. Ironically it was 
against something I wrote that was in support of something she wrote that 
others were criticising her for (that made me smile). But I don&rsquo;t hold it 
against anyone who doen&rsquo;t respond let alone Amy who has bigger fish to 
fry here.</p> </li>

<p>I am not arguing that diet, exercise, and behavior are not factors in 
developing diseases we associate with aging, I am just arguing that the aging 
process based on accumulating errors in our DNA that occur when our DNA repair 
mechanisms shut down after reproductive years, is a bigger factor than we have 
realized. Perhaps diet, exercise and behavior combined represent a maximum of 
30% predictive power of disease and death, but age (either chronologic, or 
based on measures of genomic intstability) represents a 50% ppv. The study of 
Werner&rsquo;s Syndrome contributes to the argument about the importance of the 
aging process. We have not yet learned to manipulate the Wrn gene in humans 
(they have in fruit flies), so treatment of Werner&rsquo;s focuses on the other 
factors in the disease. Even though those patients are treated with diet, 
exercise, and behavior modification, they do not have a normal life expectancy. 
As applied to American society, focus on diet, exercise, and behavior will 
result in improvements in longevity, but improvements in longevity are likely 
to be limited by the phenomenon of aging. I would scale the process of aging of 
a person to the genetic level of the shutting off of the Wrn gene that is a 
factor in the rate of repair of damage to DNA (of course, there will be other 
factors in the aging of the person). Ischemic heart disease or cancer can occur 
in a patient who is 75 who has eaten the healthiest diet, followed the best 
exercise regimen, minimized stress, etc. I would argue the incidence of 
ischemic heart disease and cancer is higher in the 75 year old doing everything 
right, than in a 25 year old doing everything wrong, but I do not have a 
citation, just clinical experience. We may achieve greater success in reducing 
incidence of at least some types of cancer by advances in gene therapy, than by 
modifications of diet, exercise, and behavior. Lung cancer and melanoma are two 
obvious exceptions. As we increase the percentage of people living past 100, we 
may see increasing incidence of leukemia/lymphoma, immune disorders, cardiac 
valvular disease, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome.
</p> 
<p>The scientific question that I could understand from the article was how 
much is the changing incidence of disease between past populations and current 
populations due to changes in diet, exercise, and other habits, versus the 
factor of aging of the population, and modern medicine which contributes to the 
aging of the population. Dr Tuteur represents the mainstream argument (in 
medicine) as answer to that question. The composition of the article has a 
central theme about romanticizing the past, other than the scientific argument, 
that makes it more interesting.</p> 
<p>Scientific evidence comes from many different disciplines, with many 
different methods. Empirical evidence (from current medical experiments) will 
tell us that diet, exercise, genetic inheritance, and behavioral factors all 
contribute to diseases that have a higher incidence in a group of people over 
forty (that does not deny that they may be factors in people under forty). 
Population statistics gives us accurate measures of disease incidence and 
mortality as a function of age. Anthropologic studies give us rough estimates 
of disease incidence and mortality as a function of age, as well as information 
about how diet, exercise, and behavior has changed across time, or in different 
cultures. Biochemical studies gives us information about reactions which may 
cause instability of DNA, or the rate of hydrolysis of simple sugars versus 
complex sugars.</p> 
<p>The analysis of the scientific evidence requires consideration of the 
different scientific methods, the accuracy and reproducibility of those 
scientific methods, the scale of the concept (reaction in a test tube, 
incidence of disease, success or health of a culture, or effects on evolution), 
and the consideration of the underlying model of disease (individuals are 
healthier because they are taller, or have lower incidence of metabolic bone 
disease, or because they live longer). Determination of scientific validity of 
our answer would ideally be done by an empirical method in a reproducible 
controlled experiment. The experimental design implies a very simple model of 
the disease. Since such an experiment is impractical, we must settle on a less 
reliable method. Since we cannot rely on a simple experiment to test the 
arguments, then I would argue that we must construct a more complex model of 
disease. The more complex model of disease allows us to assimilate evidence 
from different levels of scale (such as chemical reactions in a test tube, and 
success of different ancient societies). We can apply the model to the observed 
evidence to see how well it fits. The argument is initially won by the model 
that explains the greatest amount of evidence, with the evidence weighted by 
the reliability of the method of collection. The final winner to the argument 
is based on the ability of the model to predict observations in the future.</p> 
<p>The primary contributors to this site may have a difference in opinion 
about the importance of models in the scientific approach.</p> 
<p>Of course, it is more entertaining to argue romanticizing the past versus 
scientific method, than to construct a model of disease. I will still use 
romanticized reasons for riding my motorcycle. If you want to use romanticized 
reasons to eat raw roots and meat, I won&rsquo;t complain.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Then there are all the other issues: Infection. Someone has tried to 
argue that the H-G were really healthy due to their diet being optimal and so 
they were less prone to infection. I have no idea of that is true, but 
let&rsquo;s say it is.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Well, no. The argument was that there was less infection because one, they 
were crowded close together in one spot. Population density and settlements 
dramatically increased with the agricultural revolution, causing unintended 
consequences of infectious disease. H-G had disease, but they 
weren&rsquo;t/aren&rsquo;t the diseases of agriculture. Second, domesticated 
animals introduced new disease. The point is that H-G shouldn&rsquo;t be 
romanticized, but neither should filthy industrial or agricultural communities.
</p> 
<p>Alex Knapp is arguing the benefits of paleolithic diets, particularly with 
regards to the diseases of obesity, I&rsquo;m assuming those rich in varied 
plants, seeds, nuts, wild meat, (is whole grains in there&hellip;? I 
don&rsquo;t think H-G ate much grain at all). I could be convinced either way, 
but he is the only one providing copious amounts of evidence for his position, 
while Dr. Tuteur only keeps repeating &ldquo;But they DIED when they were 
35!!!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I also find it frustrating that she is furthering the myth that 
conventional medicine does not emphasize diet and exercise, and making it 
(unintentionally) the domain of &ldquo;alternative medicine.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Union of Concerned Scientists are not science based from what I 
have seen. Puhleeze. They are ideologues. &rdquo;</p>

<p>Okay, correcting myself here, because obviously this makes no sense. It 
should be &ldquo;NOT&rdquo; crowded together in one spot. I also had a number 
subject-verb disagreement in my last post, my apologies.</p> 
<p>Anyway, IOW, the low population density of H-G, due to lack of agriculture, 
lead to fewer infections, not their diet. It is possible that agriculture, at 
least initially, lead to a bigger population, but a lower life expectancy 
because of infectious disease. At the very least, Dr. Tuteur has certainly not 
proven her assertion that the increase in average &ldquo;lifespan&rdquo; (the 
wrong word anyway, it&rsquo;s life expectancy) can be accounted for by 
industrial farming practices (like pesticides).</p> 
<p>Dr. Tuteur:<br>
 &ldquo;The difference between an average lifespan of 48 
and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased 
agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including

<p>Harriet Hall, you said that you wonder why people aren&rsquo;t criticizing 
your blog articles the same way they are criticizing Amy Tuteur&rsquo;s. Maybe 
you can&rsquo;t see the difference between your contributions to the SBM blog 
and hers, but I can.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example from your review of the Business of Being Born.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Normal birth is not a medical problem, but it can turn into a 
life-threatening medical problem with no advance warning. Published safety 
statistics for home births are pretty good, but their validity has been 
questioned. Safety is going to vary with training, patient selection, and 
circumstances like geographical constraints. Comparisons are problematic. There 
is undeniably a small risk. The perception of the size of that risk and its 
acceptability boils down to personal attitudes and risk-taking behaviors.<br>
 
Highly-paid obstetrical expertise is not needed for most births. There is no 
reason well-trained, well-equipped midwives could not deliver babies at home 
for those who prefer it and are willing to accept the small risk. There is also 
no reason midwives could not deliver most babies within the hospital in a 
patient-friendly homelike environment with expert emergency backup right next 
door. That would be the best of both worlds.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is quite a fair general assessment of the research and state of 
affairs for homebirth. It is a dramatic difference to Amy Tuteur&rsquo;s 
position that homebirth is not suitable, period, and that anyone who promotes 
homebirth as a safe option for women is uneducated and/or deceptive.</p> 
<p>And you astutely make corrections like this, </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Amy, while I agree with your main points, I have to question one 
statement you made: &ldquo;All the existing scientific evidence shows that all 
of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false.&rdquo;<br>
 I 
think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific 
evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no CAM treatment works better 
than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even 
better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with 
isolation and purification of the active ingredient.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Again, a more accurate statement than the sweeping generalization that Amy 
Tuteur made.</p> 
<p>And you represent yourself correctly like this, </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Harriet Hall, MD also known as The SkepDoc, is a retired family 
physician who writes about pseudoscience and questionable medical 
practices.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Instead of Amy Tuteur who omits (at least on her SBM profile) that she left 
the practice of medicine and gives readers the impression that she is currently 
a practicing ob-gyn.</p> 
<p>I can be honest and say that I may not be as intelligent as some of you 
folks here, and my Masters degree is not in the sciences, but I can plainly see 
that Amy Tuteur&rsquo;s blog entries are not of the same quality as the other 
blog entries by SBM contributors. Her fanatical clinging to the notion that 
anything natural is not good and everything medical is, classes her in the 
category of extremist, similar to the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; extremists that she 
rails against. That&rsquo;s all I want to say on Amy Tuteur, as we should be 
discussing the content of the blog entry.<br>
 
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
<br> Maybe people sometimes romanticize about how we lived in the past or at 
least romanticize elements of how we lived in the past because in their minds 
the measure isn&rsquo;t exclusively life expectancy but also the quality of 
health when people are alive. Poor diet, poor lifestyle, and lack of exercise 
can contribute to lack of energy, depression and generally feeling unwell. I 
would argue that a modern fast-paced and stressful life where more junk food is 
available and cheap, and people aren&rsquo;t as physically active as they used 
to be to run their own households and farms/gardens, can mean a lower quality 
of health for an increasing number of people. Of course it is still possible to 
live a slower and less stressful life, eat nutritious food, get lots of 
exercise etc. in our modern world, but it seems like more of an effort for 
people than those living in the past who had a slower-paced life, no choice but 
to do physical labour, and the main food available was the nutritious food from 
their farm/garden. People were living closer to nature and nowadays many people 
feel so far removed from it. They may be romanticizing and trying to get back 
to nature in the wrong way, but it certainly can help describe why some people 
are interested in alternative health therapies.</p> </li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example from your review of the Business of Being Born.

<p>&ldquo;Normal birth is not a medical problem, but it can turn into a

emergency backup right next door. That would be the best of both worlds.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>But look at all the qualifiers in there? I counted at least eight. 
Can&rsquo;t you see that all these qualifiers bring Harriet&rsquo;s view so 
close to that of Amy&rsquo;s that is really only comes down to a matter of 
emphasis and style?<br>
 Again, I don&rsquo;t think that Amy would disagree 
with any of this.<br>
 What concerns her is that patients do not really truely 
understand the risk they are taking, even when it is clearly spelled out to 
them, and will blame the doctor anyway when things do go badly wrong. Her point 
was that the doctor must make absolutely clear that she really does understand 
that risk.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Harriet: &ldquo;I think it would be more accurate to say that all 
the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no CAM 
treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which 
would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested 
methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active 
ingredient.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Firstly, Harriet said &ldquo;more accurate&rdquo;, not &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.
<br> And, secondly, Amy readily agreed with my rather long summary of the 
scientific view of herbal treatment which, as far as I can tell, is just an 
expansion of Harriet&rsquo;s summary.<br>
 Really, the difference between 
Amy&rsquo;s and Harriet&rsquo;s view regarding herbal treament is probably no 
greater than the width of a bees&hellip;um&hellip;whisker.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Again, a more accurate statement than the sweeping generalization 
that Amy Tuteur made.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes, Amy: short and to the point; Harriet: more accurate but long winded 
(not a criticism at all) and both saying essentially the same thing.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Instead of Amy Tuteur who omits (at least on her SBM profile) that 
she left the practice of medicine and gives readers the impression that she is 
currently a practicing ob-gyn.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Amy was not practising when I first read her articles. 
I also didn&rsquo;t know Harriet was practising when I first read her articles 
(that was elsewhere, not here). Did it make a difference when I found out? Not

<p>Just to be clear, I&rsquo;m not advocating for CAM, I&rsquo;m advocating 
understanding why people use it, why they believe it works and why the fact 
that little bits and pieces of it here and there kind of work (or harness 
certain techniques from behavioral psychology intentionally or accidentally) 
and can be useful enough to people to lead them to believe the larger CAM 
narrative and naturalistic fallacies and Garden of Eden fantasies (you know, 
the kind that sell island vacations too). I also advocate being realistic about 
SBM and medicine in general. Romanticizing science and &ldquo;modern 
medicine&rdquo; as all good and conflating it with industry is just as romantic 
and simplistic as doing so about nature.</p> 
<p>Fifi &ndash; &ldquo;The reason why people keep going back to alternative 
health practitioners is that bits of it can work&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Billy Joe &ndash; &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t know that unless you have the 
evidence.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If people are just seeking to feel better or get some support making 
lifestyle changes (I&rsquo;m not talking about cures here) then going to see 
someone who pays attention makes them feel better. This &ldquo;social 
effect&rdquo; can also be obtained from seeing a psychotherapist or MD, which I 
would recommend over a CAM practitioner for many reasons, but if that&rsquo;s 
what people are really seeking then they can also get it from many CAM 
practitioners. Meditation does work to change neuroanatomy and for pain 
management, exercise has been shown to help alleviate mild to moderate 
depression, herbs have a biological effect and various other very non-magical 
things that CAM claims as their treatment territory. Of course, many MDs, pain 
specialists and psychologists and psychiatrists also promote these kinds of 
common sense approaches to basic mental and physical health. I just find it 
unfortunate when an SBM blogger acts as if SBM is merely about surgery and 
pharmaceuticals and make equally unscientific assertions as those promoting 
naturalist fallacies. They&rsquo;re both ideological positions and not 
reality-based thinking.</p> 
<p>BillyJoe &ndash; &ldquo;But then why use proven ineffective treatments or 
even unproven treatments to achieve this. Use the thing that&rsquo;s achieving 
the effect &ndash; understanding, empathy, compassion, psychology etc&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not always &ndash; some herbs like St-John&rsquo;s Wart have evidence 
behind it, so do meditation, exercise and diet. The problem is that CAM 
practitioners often take a little bit of science and then exaggerate it greatly 
(that&rsquo;s what makes it pseudoscience, whether it&rsquo;s CAM or Big Pharma 
doing that kind of thing). Then there&rsquo;s the issue of dosage and 
contamination vis a vis herbs, being untrained in psychology and many other 
issues. I agree it&rsquo;s preferable for someone to see an MD, psychologist or 
psychiatrist for a wide variety of reasons &ndash; the main one being so that 
they learn how their own mind works and find healthier ways to get this kind of 
support and empathy. Of course, there are psychiatrists and psychologists who 
create dependence in their patients as well or simply prescribe pills 
inappropriately (as unethical as that is) and not all MDs are capable of 
providing or arranging the kind of support someone may be seeking or need (due 
to lack of interpersonal skills, training in psychology or simply time).</p> 
<p>Fifi &ndash; &ldquo;Also, saying that the placebo effect means &ldquo;it 
doesn&rsquo;t work&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accurate and is overly simplistic &ndash; 
If a placebo is relieving someone&rsquo;s pain or depression it is working 
since the end goal of any treatment for pain or depression is to relieve pain 
or depression. What it indicates is that the actual drug may not work in the 
way anticipated and be no better than a placebo.&rdquo;<br>
 BillyJoe &ndash; 
&ldquo;There is no way round it really. If a drug works no better than placebo, 
that means it doesn&rsquo;t work. Put it another way: Does placebo work? Yes it 
does. Does the drug work? No it doesn&rsquo;t? If you want to deny that, then 
you will have to show an effect of the drug above placebo.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Agreed, if a drug works no better than a placebo then it means the drug 
doesn&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;re missing my point though &ndash; I think 
probably because you&rsquo;re thinking about this purely in terms of drug 
trials and I&rsquo;m coming at it from the perspective of treating patients. If 
a placebo works in the sense that it improves the patient&rsquo;s symptoms that 
means that a particular condition may well have a viable treatment option that 
doesn&rsquo;t involve using a drug. Why would one use a drug when it 
isn&rsquo;t necessary and has side effects but no real value for the main 
effect being tested for? Surely that&rsquo;s no different than using homeopathy 
or other forms of CAM (though patients being given pharmaceuticals that are no 
better than placebos are just as attached and convinced by their experience and 
&ldquo;feeling better&rdquo; as people given CAM treatments that are no better 
than placebos&hellip;it&rsquo;s human nature </p> </li>

<p>Harriet,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re asking about with respect to the 
response Amy generates.</p> 
<p>My understanding is that her role is to increase traffic at SBM. I 
don&rsquo;t know if she has done this, though she does elicit lots of comments 
from readers. She has stated in the past (on SBM and elsewhere) that the only 
measures of success in blogging are the number of hits and length of the 
comment thread and her writing style reflects that. (On another site when 
readers asked her whether<i>unique</i> hits are also important as a measure, 
and whether her writing style is effective in driving unique hits as well as 
total hits, she declined to respond.) While both you and David Gorski have 
stated that accuracy and effective communication are also important, Amy has 
never publicly endorsed this view.</p> 
<p>Going back to Fifi&rsquo;s point about Mark Crislip&rsquo;s post being so 
perfect there was nothing for a commenter to add, my feeling is that Amy 
deliberately writes sloppy posts with many indefensible absolutes. People 
challenge her on them and end up engaging in conversations with one another 
about topics they care about, often only tangentially related to Amy&rsquo;s 
original post.</p> 
<p>In this comment thread I mentioned that I had thought that Amy was going to 
write about the current &ldquo;stone-age diet&rdquo; and would have been 
interested to hear Amy or another SBM blogger deconstruct it. Amy promptly made 
comments on the stone age diet but they made no sense; she also demonstrated a 
poor understanding of evolution and made statements about the history of human 
diet (that our ancestors did not eat meat) that were simply false. That&rsquo;s 
fine: an obstetrician is not an anthropologist. But the fact that she 
didn&rsquo;t know what she was talking about was no obstacle to her: she made 
indefensible statements and generated comments. I don&rsquo;t think this is a 
problem for Amy. On another thread she taunted a Jew-baiter and deliberately 
prolonged a discussion of whether Judaism is inherited through the mother 
without actually bringing any insight to the thread. (Repeated injunctions to 
&ldquo;do your research.&rdquo;) Yes, more comments were added to the thread. 
They had nothing to do with SBM.</p> 
<p>Because Amy shows no restraint in talking about things she doesn&rsquo;t 
actually understand, and does not qualify her statements, I can&rsquo;t trust 
anything she says. I am willing to believe her when she talks about obstetrics, 
especially since in this field she is familiar with the literature and is clear 
about her sources and the bases for her statements. (Even then her statements 
may bear no obvious relationship to the literature, but at least we are working 
from common ground and her leaps of illogic are clear.) But for the rest, I 
follow her blog for the community of argumentative commenters that she builds, 
many of who understand a particular field much better than Amy does and are 
able to discuss it intelligently. If building a community of argumentative 
commenters is her role as an SBM blogger, then she is successful, and I 
don&rsquo;t see anything to be concerned about.</p> </li>

<p>weing &ndash; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be them, it could be 
some entrepreneurs applying their model of agriculture.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about what the particular organization being discussed 
promotes vis a vis agriculture but there are entrepreneurs and community 
organizations applying a variety of approaches to small scale and local organic 
agriculture both in North America and Europe. (We don&rsquo;t have to go back 
very far i the history of our own cities to see how a more localized farming 
system can work.) The success of CSAs (community sponsored agriculture, farms 
where you buy in a share of that year&rsquo;s produce) and the resurgence of 
farmer&rsquo;s markets are two examples are two examples. Yardshares, rooftop 
gardens and community plots are another way that more people are growing their 
own food or using urban and suburban land/spaces to grow food. In my city most 
Italian immigrant families still grow a great deal of their own fresh fruit and 
vegetables in their back yard. And, if one still wants a mango in the middle of 
winter then it&rsquo;s quite possible to buy fair trade, organic mangoes. And, 
of course, in Europe there are lots of farmers that have never changed 
traditional methods (see the Slow Food movement for more info).</p> 
<p>The main problem with rah-rah and romantic attitudes to industrial science 
&ndash; be it pharmaceuticals, factory farming and pesticides or technology 
&ndash; is that it generally takes time for us to actually understand what the 
impact upon human biology and the environment is from these new technologies. 
It doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t develop or use new technologies or 
products, some are far superior to what we had before. It does mean we should 
use common sense and some caution rather than putting short term profits for a 
few over long term effects for the many. Antibiotics and the emergence of 
superbugs is an obvious area where this applies. As is the increasing evidence 
that a sparkling clean home and no exposure to dirt and germs isn&rsquo;t very 
good for priming a kid&rsquo;s immune system. What is needed is a reasonable, 
balanced approach that deals with reality rather than indulging in romantic 
ideas about science, medicine or nature.</p> </li>

<p>In her original post, Amy states that for most of human existence the 
average human life expectancy was 35 years. This could mean a lot of different 
things, none of which she clarified. But the point that people used to die 
young at greater rates than they do today was made and taken.</p> 
<p>Later on she states that it&rsquo;s not possible for chronic diseases of 
aging to have exerted selection pressure during human evolution because people 
died young.</p> 
<p>Over hundreds of thousands &ndash; or millions &ndash; of years, for 
chronic diseases of aging to not be able to exert any selection pressure at all,
<i>everyone</i> must die young. Not just most people. </p> 
<p>Either she doesn&rsquo;t understand what she is saying, or she understands 
that she is saying that nobody<i>ever</i> got old before the advent of modern 
medicine and agriculture.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that the evidence supports the latter conclusion, but 
I could be wrong. Amy has not produced evidence for her statement, but my 
evidence for my belief that there were people who lived to old age in the past 
is pretty skimpy.</p> </li>

says. Lomborg does not &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; the dangers of global warming or 
other environmental problems.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I only have a second, and I have only read one of his books, but he agrees 
that AGW may exist, but that it&rsquo;s really not that big of a deal, in 
comparison with other problems we face (that he also attempts to diminish 
however). He completely disagrees with the Kyoto Protocol, for example. The 
editor of Scientific American in my link said the exact same thing. Dr. 
Gorski&rsquo;s links showed the same thing. Lomberg was found innocent in his 
trial, but his errors remain.</p> 
<p>The difference between Dr. Hall and Dr. Tuteur is exactly that of

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get off-track into a discussion of the very 
controversial Bjorn Lomborg, but I think it is important to correct one 
misconception that I have heard repeated over and over. He does not 
&ldquo;completely disagree&rdquo; with the Kyoto protocol: rather, he shows 
that its actual impact on global temperatures would be positive but very small. 
His objection to Kyoto is that it accomplishes too little, too late (NOT the 
argument of a global warming denier!), and that it costs money that could be 
used to save lives today with simple but effective measures like 
malaria-preventing bed nets. He advocates a better thought-out, more effective, 
more economically rational response to global warming. He argues that science 
ought to be able to come up with more effective remedies than Kyoto, and 
meanwhile there is much we can do today at little expense to improve human 
welfare more than Kyoto could. Lomborg&rsquo;s approach is far more nuanced 
than his critics claim.</p> </li>

<p>That&rsquo;s about right, though I would use the word

invited you on board at least partly for that reason. The fact that Harriet

<p>Simply repeating this over and over again doesn&rsquo;t make it true. Your 
writing isn&rsquo;t threatening, it&rsquo;s simply not good SBM writing. 
It&rsquo;s highly personalize, sensationalist cargo cult blogging. It&rsquo;s 
interesting to observe and challenge you because you use so many of exactly the 
same clich&eacute;s as CAM advocates and pseudoscience bloggers and writers.

an either-or dichotomy. If I&rsquo;m right, you must be very wrong.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, you&rsquo;re the one who keeps presenting either/or scenarios and 
extremist and high generalized naturalist vs industrialist fallacies and 
simplistic nature vs SBM fallacies regarding everything from diet, exercise, 
psychology and neurobiology and even extending into childbirth and 
circumcision. You keep making very basic errors of communication (longevity vs 
lifespan in this particular blog) and then blaming readers for 
misunderstanding. You keep answering coherent arguments and evidence with 
personalized attacks and grandiose assertions (&ldquo;you&rsquo;re all out to 
get me because you&rsquo;re threatened&rdquo; projection being a big and 
somewhat obsessive theme with you apparently).</p> 
<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; &ldquo;Therefore, you wish to censor me. It is not enough 
merely to stop reading my pieces. You want to make sure that other readers of 
SBM can&rsquo;t read what I write.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, what I was initially after was you actually writing like an SBM blogger 
and not some sort of cargo cult woo merchant who resorts to the same fallacies 
as extremist CAM advocates when critiqued. However, that seems highly unlike 
since you keep resorting to all the same rhetorical tactics as pseudoscientific 
pseudoskeptics as Big sCAM promoters and climate change deniers. It&rsquo;s 
becoming increasingly apparent you&rsquo;re not an SBM blogger at all &ndash; 
particularly since you&rsquo;re now resorting to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being 
oppressed for being a truth speaker&rdquo; fallacies rather than considering 
that perhaps your sensationalist and highly personalized style &ndash; and 
choice to present as an expert in all kinds of areas you&rsquo;re clearly not 
an expert and make grand ideological claims without presenting evidence &ndash; 
doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything to promote SBM or further actual 
understanding of medicine or science as a practice and methodology. On top of 
that you&rsquo;re damaging in terms of public perception of SBM since you are 
an ideologue abusing SBM as a platform to promote an agenda. Since you&rsquo;re 
hostile and dismissive of preventative medicine and non-surgical and 
non-pharmacological treatments, and are uncritically pro-industry, you present 
as a real life version of the cartoon pro-industry 
pseudoskeptic/pseudoscientist that CAM advocates and healthfreedomusa types 
claim scientists and doctors are.</p> 
<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; &ldquo;I have said it before and I will say it again. 
Feel free to disagree with me; feel free to argue with me; but stop LYING about 
me and stop trying to censor me.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Please, once again you&rsquo;re falling back on the same cries of 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being oppressed&rdquo; as the most ridiculous CAM and antivax 
bloggers do. You&rsquo;re unable to own up to your own rather glaring errors in 
communication or take responsibility for how you communicate (sure you change 
things after the fact but that&rsquo;s not actually honestly owning what you 
originally said, it&rsquo;s usually just erasing the evidence of your error), 
you don&rsquo;t seem to understand or be able to acknowledge how much your 
project onto people who comment and your own cognitive biases, and you 
certainly don&rsquo;t seem aware of just how often you use exactly the same 
tactics as CAM promoters of pseudoscience or ideologies. On top of that, you 
keep trying to pass off personal opinion as SBM and claim that you&rsquo;re not 
being personal when you&rsquo;re busy projecting your own motivations onto 
anyone who critiques you. It&rsquo;s just sad that you&rsquo;re doing this as 
an SBM blogger (but it&rsquo;s also fascinating in that bug under a microscope

science and communicates without resorting to simplistic and ideological 
black/white distortions. It&rsquo;s interesting that she seems to be a bit of 
an apologist for Lomborg who seems to be a pretty classic pseudoskeptic posing 
as an expert in a field outside of his expertise who romanticizes 
technology/industry. Of course, none of the SBM bloggers here are climate 
scientists (and neither am I, nor apparently is Lomborg) so, like Dr

romanticizes the present. Pseudoscience. We see this over and over again when a

voluminous critical responses in several different blogging venues. Fine, if 
that is her take she should be proud of her provocative &ldquo;Fox News&rdquo; 
style and stop with the simultaneous persecution complex that readers are 
trying to &ldquo;censor&rdquo; her (tres bizarre).</p> 
<p>I also have to say that for a self-described staunch defender of

<p>You know, Rachel Carson also made some errors in &ldquo;Silent

<p>I am the wrong person to debate this subject. Simply put, he is a political 
scientist whose environmental conclusions go against most major scientific 
organizations in the world. As a layperson, I have to decide who is credible 
and who is not. He seems like a rogue &ldquo;environmentalist&rdquo; whose only 
training is in political science, and has been brought to trial for charges of 
plagiarism, fabrication of data, deliberate misinterpretation, etc etc etc. So 
I am skeptical of his skepticism. I suppose it is possible that all of the

<p>That&rsquo;s not what I got from his books. I understood him to say that 
there are various predictions of the extent of global warming and that some of 
those predictions may be overly alarmist, that it is simplistic to only look at 
the bad consequences and fail to take into account even the possibility of some 
good consequences, that there are a lot of other bad things that need to be 
dealt with (disease, lack of access to clean water, etc.) that have the 
potential to save many lives and improve human welfare NOW, and that our 
limited economic resources should be applied judiciously considering where they 
can do the most good in both the short term and the long term. He also proposes 
that instead of leaping wholeheartedly into expensive solutions that we 
&ldquo;think&rdquo; will work, we should test proposals to reduce global 
warming with a scientific approach where something is tried and the results are 
continuously monitored allowing adaptation of policy in response to the data.

<p>Alison you&rsquo;ve touched on something I too have been mulling over. If 
Amy is indeed so threatening, and her basic premise is that medicine should be 
science based, then wouldn&rsquo;t all the sbm bloggers be as threatening, for 
that is their basic premise as well? Yet why don&rsquo;t they receive the same 
types of negative commentary?</p> 
<p>My perception is that other sbm bloggers give the kind of thoughtful , 
sometimes long winded (and occasionally arrogant, which is tolerable if 
accompanied by accuracy) comments that are required of a complex subject. It 
seems that those critical of Amy&rsquo;s style are so for the same reason that 
sbm bloggers (including Amy) criticize the general media inaccuracies when 
reporting on science and medicine: the brevity and sensationalism of science 
and medical reporting generally found in the media does not lend itself to the 
accurate communication (qualifiers and all) of a complex topic.</p> </li>

<p>Dr Hall, it&rsquo;s interesting that you&rsquo;re an advocate for 
Lomborg&rsquo;s political/ideological position even though he&rsquo;s been 
called out by climate scientists as promoting bad science (either willingly or 
purely by virtual of ignorance). Nothing wrong with having a personal or 
political position, of course. Pretending that it&rsquo;s evidence or science 
based when it&rsquo;s not, however, is problematic whether we&rsquo;re 
discussing medicine or climate change. It&rsquo;s leaving the realm of 
reality-based thinking to enter the land of ideology where the great woobeast 
flourishes. Accusing others of being emotional and irrational or not 
science-based in the context of someone being critiqued for promoting bad or 
pseudo science is just weird on an SBM blog (and pretty much a fall back tactic 
of dishonest pseudoskeptics of all stripes, whether they&rsquo;re applying 
pseudoskepticism to medicine or anything else). Just because it sounds 
&ldquo;common sense&rdquo; to you or aligns with your beliefs doesn&rsquo;t 
mean his approach is actually evidence or science based &ndash; even if he 
makes a ritual showing of presenting science. You&rsquo;re making the same kind 
of error involving confirmation biases that believers of woo do about 
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; cures and so on.</p> </li>

<p>Fifi,<br>
 You are reading more into my words than I intended. I&rsquo;m 
not an advocate for any ideology Lomborg may support; I&rsquo;m an advocate for 
trying to understand what his position is.</p> 
<p>He is clearly evidence- and science-based, although he has made mistakes 
about what the evidence shows. The percentage of his mistakes is small compared 
to the percent of facts he got right, and correcting those mistakes would not 
be enough to change his arguments. Anyway, it is inaccurate to say that such 
mistakes constitute &ldquo;promoting bad or pseudo science.&rdquo; It is more 
accurate to say that he is promoting good science but made some mistakes in a 
field that he is not an expert in.</p> 
<p>His whole thrust is not to support any particular ideology but to encourage 
skeptical critical thinking based on scientific evidence and uncontaminated by 
emotions and beliefs. His discussion of how money should be spent is not a 
prescription but a recognition of the practical reality that the money is 
finite and that we have some hard choices to make. In all the criticisms I have 
read about him, no one has addressed his main points or even shown that they 
understood them.</p> </li> 
<li> # Zoe237 <em>on 21 Feb 2010 at 4:41 pm </em> 
<p>Dr. Hall:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;His critics have responded to errors he made, but they have not 
responded to his main points which would still be valid if all those errors 
were corrected.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Does this make sense? If the premises of your argument are incorrect, what 
does it say about your conclusion? It doesn&rsquo;t prove said conclusion 
false, but it doesn&rsquo;t prove it true either.</p> 
<p>How would the main point be valid if the premises are in error? </p> 
<p>The same logic has been a defense of Dr. Tuteur- that her premises may be 
wrong, but her main point remains intact. For example, she disagrees with a 
targeted c-section rate of 15% proposed by the WHO. One of her premises is that 
c-sections DO NOT lead to higher maternal mortality (perhaps morbidity). Yet 
ACOG and WHO say that maternal mortality, while difficult to measure because of 
confounders, is 3 to 7 times larger with cesarean section. They have loads of 
research to back that up. Factual errors matter, if left uncorrected by the 
author. Yes, these are small differences, but small differences matter in the 
messy world of science. (Look at the tree ring debate in AGW).</p> 
<p>Lomberg was brought up on charges with the Danish Committee on Scientific 
Dishonesty. The finding was that while the book was scientifically dishonest, 
it wasn&rsquo;t fraud because Lomberg wasn&rsquo;t an expert. I think the 
ruling was later said aside&hellip; I read the book almost ten years ago. The 
Skeptical Environmentalist and the resulting uproar is really instructive for 
skeptics of any stripe. (And I really disagree with the witchhunt aspect to 
silencing opposition in this case). What the lesson is, I have no idea! But the

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that someone communicating in an emotional or 
passionate manner doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean they&rsquo;re being 
irrational or that what they&rsquo;re communicating isn&rsquo;t evidence or 
science based. Passionately held positions can be based on very solid evidence 
or science (and remain evidence based if one is willing to consider new 
evidence when it appears and/or if one&rsquo;s passion is for an outcome rather 
than an attachment to a certain process or belief). Entirely irrational 
positions or beliefs, when one considers the evidence, can also be presenting 
in a very unemotional way. A lot of pseudoscience and pseudoskepticism does 
this &ndash; that&rsquo;s the ritual or cargo cult aspect of it, how it 
presents as being scientific or rational but doesn&rsquo;t actually conform to 
scientific or skeptical processes or results (it does things like cherry pick 
evidence, misrepresent the actual science, be unreasonably skeptical in the 
face of reasonable evidence, etc).</p> 
<p>For instance, while most of us who support SBM probably have very rational 
reasons for doing so, my guess is that quite a few of us are also passionate 
about science, medicine and SBM and that contributes to why we participate here.
</p> 
<p>Granted, my interest in cognitive science, neurobiology, psychology and 
emotions &ndash; and people, art and how we communicate and perceive the world 
&ndash; probably means I&rsquo;m biased towards seeing emotions as being as 
important as reason, and emotions and logic as not being mutually exclusive. 
Within cognitive science it&rsquo;s understood that reason and decision making 
is rarely (barring a neurobiological problem) a purely logical process. When 
people do have neurological damage that removes emotion entirely from the 
decision making process it causes all kinds of real world problems. Trying to 
pretend that one is never swayed by emotion or subject to cognitive biases is 
really pretty deluded and, not surprisingly, makes one even more prone to being 
swayed by emotion or unaware of cognitive and confirmation biases.</p> </li>

<p>Ah but you keep acting like an apologist and making excuses for why his bad 
science is okay because you think he&rsquo;s promoting &ldquo;common

you intend via these shaky kinds of arguments that scream &ldquo;confirmation

the fact that neither you nor he are climate scientists and the people 
you&rsquo;ve denigrated as being &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; for critiquing him are 
actually climate scientists. Sounds pretty much like a confirmation bias and, 
consequently, as if you&rsquo;re being an apologist for someone you agree with.
</p> 
<p>His arguments about how money should be spent have been cut down over and 
over again. For instance, why not take money away from bankrolling wars to 
spend on medicine? (You&rsquo;d have the added benefit of not maiming and 
killing people in wars and polluting the environment and drinking water, sounds 
like a win win situation. Of course, it&rsquo;s not a pro-industry approach, 
it&rsquo;s a pro-human one instead. ) He&rsquo;s creating a false (and

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid not, Harriet. Lomborg&rsquo;s mistakes were so glaring, 
both in quantity and quality, that they easily bring into question his entire 
thesis, the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; aspects of it notwithstanding, and, more 
importantly, his mistakes are consistent with allowing an ideological agenda 
override science. They were not random mistakes, as one might expect if he were 
just getting it wrong without an agenda. They were all in the direction of 
either downplaying or denying the severity of AGW. Such a pattern of error 
always sets my skeptical antennae a&rsquo;twitchin&rsquo;, as I like to say. 
Lomborg also seems to fall into the &ldquo;either or&rdquo; fallacy; i.e., the 
fallacy of the false dilemma. Either we try to reduce malaria or we try to 
reduce carbon emissions, not both. Yet there is no reason why we can&rsquo;t do

interpret what they read in the light of their personal knowledge, experience,

readers than about the text. I won&rsquo;t argue about Lomborg any more: I 
think it is obvious that all his readers are biased in one way or another,

owning up to your own bias and claiming that all readers (do you include

contention. Even Marsden Wagner, the WHO official who pushed through the 
recommendation acknowledges that there was never any evidence. YOU have been 
unable to provide any evidence for it. Nonetheless you persist in insisting 
that it must be true and resort to personal attacks to divert attention from

possible to prove a negative, when people say &ldquo;There is no good evidence 
for the effectiveness of homeopathy&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is no evidence at

<p>There just seems to be no recognition by Dr Hall that he got his facts 
wrong&hellip;</p> 
<p>Dr Hall &ndash; &ldquo;He is clearly evidence- and science-based, although 
he has made mistakes about what the evidence shows. The percentage of his 
mistakes is small compared to the percent of facts he got right, and correcting 
those mistakes would not be enough to change his arguments. Anyway, it is 
inaccurate to say that such mistakes constitute &ldquo;promoting bad or pseudo 
science.&rdquo; It is more accurate to say that he is promoting good science 
but made some mistakes in a field that he is not an expert in.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Here Dr Hall dismisses his mistakes regarding the science and claims that 
there&rsquo;s no ulterior motive and isn&rsquo;t promoting pseudoscience. Dr 
Gorski shows that it wasn&rsquo;t just getting one or two small things wrong 
and that there&rsquo;s a bias (as did the many climate scientists that Dr Hall 
dismissed as being &ldquo;emotional&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>Dr Hall &ndash; &ldquo;They are mostly common sense points about how to 
think about the subject, rather than specific arguments that depend on the 
facts his critics say he got wrong.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No admission that he got facts wrong here, just that &ldquo;his 
critics&rdquo; said he got it wrong. Of course, his critics were actual climate 
scientists! Would Dr Hall frame medical scientists&rsquo; expertise in this 
same way in a discussion of medicine when the scientific consensus was being 
challenged by someone not versed in medical science?</p> 
<p>Really, Dr Hall is being an apologist and claiming on the one hand that his 
ideas are &ldquo;clearly science and evidence based&rdquo; and then claims 
they&rsquo;re just common sense so the bad science doesn&rsquo;t matter because 
really he&rsquo;s telling us how to think&hellip;um, using bad science and 
confirmation bias apparently. In this case, &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; seems to 
be code for &ldquo;agrees with what I already believe&rdquo;. When a CAM 
promoter makes these same claims about &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; or presents 
distorted science as evidence we question them &ndash; rightly so. The same 
should apply to all of our own ideas, no matter how much we emotionally feel 
they&rsquo;re &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; or how sciency they look even if we 
can&rsquo;t expertly dissect the science ourselves.</p> </li>

<p>Again with the absolutes. I&rsquo;m not sure what the right number is. I do 
know there are active worldwide and national efforts to lower the c-section 
rate because of possible increased neonatal and maternal mortality and 
morbidity from elective cesareans. ACOG along with he US Healthy People 
guidelines also set some numerical goals. Once again, I can believe you or 
every medical organization in the world.</p> 
<p> Of course I believe cesareans are necessary sometimes. What I don&rsquo;t 
believe is that the 80% being done in Latin America (for example) are, or the 
45% rate in some U.S. hospitals. I could say the same about the hysterectomy 
rate- too many unnecessary surgeries.</p> </li>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re trying to change the subject. I made a claim; you&rsquo;ve

attacking both Dr Tuteur and anything she says. I agree with Dr Hall that she 
is being treated unfairly. The hypothesis that the average life expectancy has 
more than doubled due to science-based medicine is hardly controversial. There 
are other writers on SBM who also publish opinion pieces. We get it people, you

<p>Exactly. His books discussing AGW are so riddled with errors of science 
that it&rsquo;s really quite impossible to figure out when what he is arguing 
is science-based and when it isn&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t already know quite 
a bit about the science. That&rsquo;s what makes him so problematic. 
Intelligent and even skeptical people like Harriet can find his arguments 
compelling because they don&rsquo;t know the background science.</p> 
<p>A few years ago, I used to be a lot more &ldquo;skeptical&rdquo; of AGW. 
However, then I took the time to learn a bit more about the science, and it 
rapidly became clear to me that most of my objections were based on a lack of 
understanding and, in essence, arguments from incredulity and ignorance.</p>

<p>BillyJoe, I completely disagree with your opinion about Harriet Hall vs. 
Amy Tuteur&rsquo;s writings and ways of portraying themselves on this blog. 
Harriet Hall is generally more well-balanced in her views and considers issues 
beyond a mere black and white viewpoint. Amy is completely focused on 
discrediting natural childbirth and its practices. (Still waiting for a 
definition of natural childbirth though&hellip;).</p> 
<p>weing, you can be sarcastic and flex your intellectual muscles &ndash; 
I&rsquo;m easy prey for you. Enjoy </p> 
<p>Hjordis, you haven&rsquo;t been reading carefully if that is your 
conclusion. And you might want to also read for a few months on Amy Tuteurs own 
blog and you will get a better picture of what she is all about.</p> 
<p>I have been quite puzzled how SBM editors could read Amy Tuteurs own blog 
and view her Ask Dr. Amy website and still accept her as a contributor here. 
(Unless maybe they do want more controversy and readership for this 
site&hellip;)</p> 
<p>In any case, she is here, and her writing is constantly critiqued even by 
those who have not encountered her before. Her writing and the responses 
generated will have to speak for themselves when it comes to quality and bias. 
I just hope it won&rsquo;t be to the detriment of the purpose of a SBM blog in 
the first place.</p> </li>

<li> # Harriet Hall <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 3:10 am </em> 
<p>David,</p> 
<p>I am not skeptical of AGW and neither is Lomborg. We all agree that the 
problem is serious and that action is needed. The devil is in the details.</p> 
<p>In &ldquo;Cool It,&rdquo;Lomborg calls for cooling the earth but also 
cooling the emotional heat of the debate about what actions to take. He 
advocates a cool-headed scientific approach instead of rushing prematurely into 
the most radical, expensive procedures based on panic and emotion a la Al Gore 
(whose movie also contained a lot of errors).</p> 
<p>You may not agree with the ordering of priorities in the Copenhagen 
Consensus but I hope that you can agree with the general principles. As a 
doctor, you weigh the risks and benefits of every treatment, and you 
don&rsquo;t rush to adopt every proposed new experimental treatment before its 
value is demonstrated. You don&rsquo;t get so fixated on treating a 
patient&rsquo;s cancer that you neglect to treat his other medical conditions 
like diabetes and hypertension, some of which might kill him before the cancer 
does. As a research grant competitor, you understand that funds are limited and 
priorities must be set somehow.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s what I hear Lomborg saying. I don&rsquo;t hear his critics 
responding to any of that. Something is wrong.</p> 
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s me. I didn&rsquo;t go into his books with any conscious 
bias, but I&rsquo;m willing to admit that my reading comprehension could be 
unconsciously impaired by a tendency to optimism and a distrust of alarmism. By 
the same token, others might be equally and oppositely biased by a tendency to 
pessimism and catastrophism. The sober, unbiased truth is hard to get at. And 
even the most accurate scientific data can&rsquo;t tell us what is the 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do. That&rsquo;s a human judgment call.</p> </li>

<p>zoe,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The difference between Dr. Hall and Dr. Tuteur is exactly that of 
QUALIFIERS.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So then why are we arguing?<br>
 There were posters here saying that 
Amy&rsquo;s opinions on what the science says (regarding herbal treatments) was 
different from Harriet&rsquo;s opinon of what the science says. I responded 
that their views were pretty much the same. For the sake of brevity and impact, 
Amy assumes the qualifiers. For completeness and clarity, Harriet spells them 
out.<br>
 With Amy, you have to read between the lines.<br>
 With Harriet, ypou 
have it all laid out for you.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Dr. T&rsquo;s writing is fine for the back of a cereal box, but I 
had come to expect more nuance from the bloggers here because of the more 
knowledgeable readers. I am really really suprised that many can&rsquo;t see 
how she overly simplifies complicated medical and science topics.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>She simplifies for impact.<br>
 Herbal treatments are useless. That is a 
good take home message. Of course there is a long list of qualifiers but, as 
long as you are aware of them (as Amy is as she has demonstrated), I have no 
problem with that take home message. After all, those qualifiers do not alter 
the basic conclusion that herbal treatments are useless.</p> 
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p> 
<p>wales,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As to differences between Harriet&rsquo;s style and Amy&rsquo;s, 
give me long-winded and accurate any day, over short, strident and inaccurate. 
Qualifiers are an extremely important part of scientific communication, and 
Billy Joe&rsquo;s attempt to gloss over and reconcile Harriet&rsquo;s and 
Amy&rsquo;s style differences as a matter of qualifiers just doesn&rsquo;t cut 
it for me.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost sight of what I was responding to. The point was that 
Harriet and Amy have the same views on what the science says (regarding herbal 
remedies), they just have a different way of communicting that view.<br>
 I 
haven&rsquo;t anywhere stated which style or method I prefer.<br>
 As to the 
qualifiers: that is exactly the difference between them &ndash; Amy implies 
them, Harriet spells them out.</p> 
<p>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p> 
<p>weing,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Am I an AGW denialist if I like global warming and want more of it? 
I always looked upon myself as a global warming proponent.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You are a very naughty boy is what you are!<br>
 (A denialist is one who, 
when presented with facts contrary to his position, instead of confronting 
them, ignores them and continues on expounding his original position completely 
unfazed by those contrary facts)</p>

<p>StatlerWaldorf</p> 
<p>&ldquo;BillyJoe, I completely disagree with your opinion about Harriet Hall

Harriet Hall is generally more well-balanced in her views and considers issues 
beyond a mere black and white viewpoint.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If you are entitled to make that differentiation than perhaps we should 
also allow that the difference is that Harriet is wishy washy and Amy is direct.
<br> I prefer to say that their styles are different.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Amy is completely focused on discrediting natural childbirth and its 
practices.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.<br>

<p>BillyJoe on the necessity of qualifiers:</p> 
<p><i>&ldquo;For the sake of brevity and impact, Amy assumes the qualifiers. 
For completeness and clarity, Harriet spells them out. With Amy, you have to 
read between the lines. With Harriet, you have it all laid out for you.&rdquo;
</i></p> 
<p>To rephrase: &ldquo;Harriet says what she means. Amy sometimes (often?) 
says something different from what she means. Readers must either already know 
what she means in order to interpolate the qualifiers she omitted (in which 
case there&rsquo;s no point in reading anything she writes, because they 
already know it) or guess (meaning they might guess wrong) or challenge her 
statements (in which case they are accused of not liking her).&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I actually prefer the idea that she is deliberately using a pedagogical 
technique of withholding crucial elements or including distractors to get her 
readers to think for themselves. If so, it works and I (mostly) appreciate it.

<p>BillyJoe on herbal treatments: </p> 
<p><i>&ldquo;Herbal treatments are useless.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Neither Amy nor Harriet said that. </p> 
<p>Amy said that alternative medicine is useless, and later defined 
alternative medicine as that which is useless. By that definition, any herbal 
treatments which are not useless (eg foxglove for dropsy, white willow bark for 
fever and pain) are not alternative.</p> 
<p>Harriet said that some herbal treatments are (or could be) an exception to 
the general statement that alternative medicine as useless, though they are 
inferior to their pharmaceutical counterparts.</p> </li>

</blockquote> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to tally up errors, then actually I would reiterate 
that Lomborg had way more errors and flaws in science in just one chapter on 
AGW in<em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em> than Al Gore had in his movie and 
book combined. It&rsquo;s not even close.</p> 
<p>http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/GoreversusLomborg.htm</p> 
<p>Not that errors alone are the measure, given that both Lomborg and Gore are 
making political arguments. After all, one huge error can trump a dozen 
piddling minor errors. However, Lomborg&rsquo;s errors are not minor. They are 
also far more numerous and nearly all skew in one direction.</p> </li> 
<li> # BillyJoe <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 7:02 am </em> 
<p>Alison,</p> 
<p>Your post changes nothing of what I said.</p> 
<p>Okay, Amy said CAM was useless (which means that herbal treatments are 
useless, no?). But herbal treatment was singled out by Harriet as an exception 
and she posted the beginnings of a list of qualifiers which I expanded to a 
large paragraph.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Amy said that alternative medicine is useless, and later defined 
alternative medicine as that which is useless. By that definition, any herbal 
treatments which are not useless (eg foxglove for dropsy, white willow bark for 
fever and pain) are not alternative.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, foxglove and willow bark ARE alternative.<br>
 But digoxin, acetyl 
salicylic acid are not.<br>
 They are herb-based pharmaceuticals.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Harriet said that some herbal treatments are (or could be) an 
exception to the general statement that alternative medicine as useless, though 
they are inferior to their pharmaceutical counterparts.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes those qualifiers again.<br>
 They may not be strictly 
&ldquo;useless&rdquo;, but as an alternative to the herb-based pharmaceuticals, 
would you &ldquo;use&rdquo; them?<br>
 Of course not.<br>
 Apart for the active 
ingredient, they contain other substances which may be neutral and therefore 
unnecessary, but may have unknown detrimental effects. The active ingredients 
are present in variable amounts depending on the souce and season, and 
sometimes not present at all. They may contain unintended contaminants such as 
arsenic, lead or mercury or deliberately laced with actual pharmaceuticals.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I actually prefer the idea that she is deliberately using a 
pedagogical technique of withholding crucial elements or including distractors 
to get her readers to think for themselves. If so, it works and I (mostly) 
appreciate it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Fair enough.<br>
 I think she paints with a broad brush for impact.<br>
 I 
think her broad brush &ldquo;CAM is useless&rdquo; is pretty good in achieving 
that result. And, with the unstated qualifiers &ndash; which don&rsquo;t add up 
to much &ndash; it is basically the truth of the matter.</p> </li>

(? all) who formed their personal opinions without reading the scientific

that they have misinterpreted them.</p>

claims: &ldquo;And scientific consensus may be irrevelant to you. But it is

<p>I&rsquo;d be concerned if I were being repeatedly criticized by doctors and 
scientists who provided relevant quotes from appropriate papers. And I&rsquo;d 
be concerned if I were being criticized by lay people who provided relevant 
quotes from appropriate papers. It&rsquo;s difficult to take seriously the

not at all restricted to SBM, in contrast to the hellishness of the past/nature.

<p>BillyJoe on alternative medicine:<br>
<i>&ldquo;No, foxglove and willow 
bark ARE alternative.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Amy Tuteur on alternative health:<br>
<i>&ldquo;&ldquo;Alternative&rdquo; 
health refers to theories and treatments that are invoked and used despite a 
lack of scientific support, and often in the face of scientific evidence that 
shows that they are untrue or don&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to define terms. My personal 
definition of alternative medicine is stuff that I can access without a 
gatekeeper. So foxglove is in there.</p> 
<p>Amy&rsquo;s definition is that there&rsquo;s no scientific support for the 
treatment or its mode of action. By that definition foxglove might or might not 
be alternative. It works and its mode of action is explained by science 
(therefore not alternative) but pharmaceuticals are more predictable (therefore 
science doesn&rsquo;t support using foxglove over pharmaceuticals if 
pharmaceuticals are available, therefore alternative in most modern contexts). 
(My grandfather&rsquo;s black bag contains, among other things, a standardized 
digitalis preparation: that is, a herbal preparation that a pharmaceutical 
company standardized to a certain strength.)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying one definition is better than another (there are a lot 
of problems with my personal definition); just that defining terms is important.

<p>Regarding the errors in Lomborg&rsquo;s and Gore&rsquo;s books. There are 
many types of errors, some egregious, some not. Wouldn&rsquo;t a better measure 
be a ratio of errors to claims? Say, if Lomborg makes a 1000 claims and 500 are 
shown to be errors the ratio would be 0.5. If Al makes 4 claims and 2 are shown 
to be errors the ratio would also be 0.5. This would obviate the biasing by

choices and demeaning women who make different choices.&rdquo; (Bold added by 
me, because it is too funny!)</p> 
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve been reading your blog for quite some time and it is very 
easy to rack up many comments with the heated discussion there. Please explain 
how I have glorified my birth choices and point to where I have ever demeaned 
other women who make different choices. It is a sad world when people can say 
they had manageable labours with non-pharmacological methods of pain 
management, uncomplicated births, and were able to breastfeed successfully and 
that is considered as &ldquo;glorification&rdquo; or &ldquo;demeaning&rdquo; to 
those who had other experiences. The choices made for my births were based on 
me and my partner&rsquo;s wishes and the circumstances of each pregnancy. I 
have never commented on your site that all low-risk pregnant women should be 
homebirthing. Anyone can view my comments in context and decide for themselves.
</p> 
<p>If you want to talk about demeaning other women, maybe you should retract 
your blog entries where you characterize women who don&rsquo;t birth in 
hospitals, choose non-pharmacological pain relief, and are pro-breastfeeding as

<p>Amy Tuteur on alternative medicine:<br>
<i>&ldquo;[Alison Cummins 
said]&ldquo;My personal definition of alternative medicine is stuff that I can 
access without a gatekeeper.&rdquo;</i></p><i> </i>
<p><i>But that&rsquo;s not a definition shared by anyone else.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t asked. Maybe, maybe not. Which is why 
if I were to discuss &ldquo;alternative medicine,&rdquo; I would define it 
first. But if you were to go up to someone on the street and ask them to define 
alternative medicine, I don&rsquo;t know how many would say &ldquo;anything 
that doesn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; either. Promoters of CAM include diet and 
exercise as CAM treatments to prove that CAM is very popular and even 
scientific. I suspect (but don&rsquo;t know) that most people think there are 
some alternative remedies that work, in which case they don&rsquo;t share your 
definition either.</p> 
<p><i>&ldquo;By your definition, Prilosec is alternative medicine because you 
can buy it over the counter.&rdquo;</i></p> 
<p>Yup, as I said, there are problems with my definition and I don&rsquo;t 
promote it over anyone else&rsquo;s. Perhaps I could say &ldquo;OTC drugs if 
used off-label; anything else that doesn&rsquo;t require a gatekeeper.&rdquo;

<p>Billy joe, I disagree that the appropriate use of qualifiers in science 
communication is merely a personal style choice. It is necessary for the sake 
of clarity, accuracy and credibility. I didn&rsquo;t begin reading sbm over a 
year ago because of a desire for Fox News type journalism, but for the 
opposite. You appear to be a champion of brevity and your comments that 
&ldquo;I think she paints with a broad brush for impact. &ldquo; and 
&ldquo;And, with the unstated qualifiers &ndash; which don&rsquo;t add up to 
much &ndash; it is basically the truth of the matter.&rdquo; Leave me wondering 
if you believe that impact is placed above accuracy on a hierarchy of effective 
science writing skills. Science is not about &ldquo;painting with a broad 
brush&rdquo; (and sbm is about science,no?)and I can get that type of broad 
brush science reporting from any mass media product. I also disagree with the 
idea that because blogs are &ldquo;different&rdquo; (i.e. have a lower bar for 
accountability and accuracy?) that anything goes. That may be true for most 
blogs, but my impression was that sbm tries to distinguish itself from the 
pack. Perhaps my impressions have been wrong for the past year and I should 
just realize that a blog is a blog is a blog&hellip;..hence my decision to view 
this site as an entertainment venue.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 9:44 am </em> 
<p>Dr Hall &ndash; You&rsquo;re providing a very fine example of how an 
intelligent and educated person can be seduced by pseudoscience when it 
confirms their &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; feeling or opinion about a subject. 
Even when the experts have pointed out the bad science and how the science is 
being manipulated for ideological ends! Because you like the sciency feel of 
Lomborg&rsquo;s book, even though you don&rsquo;t actually have the expertise 
to analyze the science in this case, and you consider yourself to be 
&ldquo;scientifically minded&rdquo; and agree with his opinions, you give him 
total credence and just brush off the actual experts as being 
&ldquo;emotional&rdquo;. This is not very different from people into CAM who 
think that medical pseudoscience supports their opinion or &ldquo;common 
sense&rdquo; belief.</p> 
<p>We all tend to think our own opinion or approach is &ldquo;common 
sense&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a very common form of confirmation bias and cognitive 
trap. It&rsquo;s why you get engineers and graduates of computer and political 
science who think that the &ldquo;science&rdquo; part or having done statistics 
means they&rsquo;re equally qualified in medical science. Climate science is 
complicated and we certainly don&rsquo;t know everything (this is also true of 
medical science) &ndash; that&rsquo;s why reliable experts are so important and 
discussions need to be based on good science (meaning in reality!). It&rsquo;s 
also why proponents of pseudoscience and experts who bastardize science for 
ideological reasons need to be weeded out AND we need to be vigilant for the 
tendency for confirmation biases in ourselves. It&rsquo;s one good reason to 
read ideas and to talk with people we disagree with, be they experts or not.</p>
<p>And, yes, the Al Gores, Lomborgs and the energy industry (from oil/gas, 
hydro to &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;) &ndash; and their other public faces 
&ndash; all have ulterior motives that include money, fame and power. Just 
because all these competing commercial and ego interests that pose as 
left/right (liberal/conservative) are using the issue of climate change to 
further personal, political or corporate agendas doesn&rsquo;t mean that 
climate change and environmental damage from pollution isn&rsquo;t happening. 
It&rsquo;s just disaster capitalism in action, it&rsquo;s hardly a new way to 
make oodles of cash (one good reason to know history is to be able to see 
patterns repeat themselves). Scientists have been discussing the impact of 
climate change, environmental pollution and finite resources since the 1970s. 
Of course, no one really listens to scientists &ndash; particularly when it 
requires making changes and there&rsquo;s a lot of money and power at stake and 
industry has more clout. (Poor Carter tried to wake up the US regarding energy 
independence and the environment but was trounced out of office for it. Then 
the decades of deregulation got rolling &ndash; under both neo-liberals and 
neo-conservatives.)</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re genuinely worried about clean water then reducing and 
cleaning up industrial pollution and domestic waste is essential, as is not 
polluting the land and water during wartime by using depleted uranium weapons, 
or mining by removing whole mountain tops, and so on. There are a 101 reasons 
&ndash; many of them public health reasons &ndash; to reduce industrial 
pollution of our environment and to recognize that we need to use finite 
resources more wisely. Technology is undoubtedly part of the solution but so is 
simply stopping doing some really stupid things for short term profit or 
because we&rsquo;re energy gluttons. If you&rsquo;re concerned about malaria, 
not using poor nations as industrial dumping grounds and factory fodder is part 
of that picture.</p> 
<p>Dr Hall, clearly you share some political views with Dr Tuteur and feel 
aligned with her on a wide variety of subjects. I don&rsquo;t particularly take 
issue with that if you&rsquo;d both be honest about your personal biases (with 
yourselves and us) instead of insisting that your personal opinions or beliefs 
are evidence based when they&rsquo;re not. Dr Tutuer has shown herself to be 
entirely uncritical of the commercial aspects of medicine, and of pseudoscience 
when promoted by industry. Her prejudices lead her to make up lies/emotional 
accusations about those she disagrees with for ideological reasons (often in 
areas where she is clearly not an expert).</p> 
<p>Starting from her first blog, she&rsquo;s been called out by medical 
researchers for misinterpreting data or research methodology and assigning 
nefarious intent to researchers she disagrees with (which is an attempt to 
manipulate using emotion). Clearly she&rsquo;s not exactly an expert or 
experienced vis a vis medical research (being a practicing doctor IS different 
than being a researcher). Her post on antidepressants not only accused 
psychologists of having nefarious intentions but entirely ignored the 
professional context of the discussion within psychology and psychiatry about 
anti-depressant use. She also ignored the well-known fact that pharmaceutical 
companies got caught red handed cooking data around SSRIs (surely relevant to 
the discussion). She focused on one meta-study to try to discredit all 
criticism of SSRIs, she ignored a critical story by a much more qualified 
expert than herself in the NYT to make sensationalist accusations about lack of 
context and sensationalism in MSM reporting (which is pretty ironic), and so on.
</p> 
<p>All of these are the tactics of woo merchants that peddle pseudoscience to 
promote an ideological position and Fox news reporters and not of SBM bloggers 
or skeptical thinkers. Skepticism has to be universally applied &ndash; and we 
also need to be skeptical about our own &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; feelings and 
beliefs &ndash; for it to be true skepticism. If we simply routinely read or 
support opinions because they align with our own then we&rsquo;re simply 
feeding a confirmation bias. If we want to constantly reduce complex issues 
with areas of scientific uncertainty to sensationalist opinion pieces that 
contain no scientific evidence on an SBM blog we have no grounds to complain 
when the MSM does it (in fact, we&rsquo;re bigger hypocrites). There&rsquo;s 
nothing wrong with opinion pieces or a good rant &ndash; many of us enjoy 
reading them and having our emotional reactions and biases confirmed (and some 
of us enjoy having them challenged). The problem arises when we try to pass off 
our opinions and emotional rants as being science, or distort or misrepresent 
the scientific evidence (or scientists) to support our personal bias, or try to 
claim scientific authority in fields we&rsquo;re not experts in and dismiss the 
experts as being &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; or having nefarious intent when 
there&rsquo;s no evidence that they do. So far Dr Tuteur has done all these 
things repeatedly and then claims to be being victimized for being called out 
on doing so (unless it&rsquo;s a research scientist doing so who&rsquo;s caught 
her inappropriately presenting evidence, then she&rsquo;s all about the suck 
up&hellip;which would be fine if she was actually learning from it and 
didn&rsquo;t simply then repeat the same emotionally-based ad hominem type of 
attack to try to discredit a research scientist she disagrees with yet again!) 
All of these things combined are what make Dr Tuteur into a cargo cult science 
blogger and makes it a real shame that she&rsquo;s using SBM as a platform to 
promote ideological positions as SBM rather than using this platform to educate 
lay people about SBM, how science and medicine work, and the difference between 
science and pseudoscience and how to spot bloggers and writers that promote 
pseudoscience.</p> </li>

<p>My point was that you aren&rsquo;t even a part of the conversation in the

<p>But since you mention it, there have been several doctors and scientists on 
this website who have criticized or questioned your leaps of logic, including 
Dr. Hall (AAP/ACOG position on circumcision), Dr. Gorski (the point of a

winddriven (cesarean section, can&rsquo;t remember the exact objection), and 
then there are the dozens of commenters who I have no idea who they are, but 
have been critical. Of course, most of these are with errors in your logic, not 
necessarily your conclusion. Particularly critical of the numerous errors and 
direct contradictions in your circumcision post.</p> 
<p>As for academic ob/gyn researchers, I&rsquo;ve only seen one, possibly two, 
agreeing or disagreeing with you.</p> 
<p>Your trademarks are false causation (life expectancy and numerous 
&ldquo;conclusions&rdquo;), false dichomoties (cesarean section or unattended 
homebirth), ad hominem attacks of midwives, continuous assignment of nefarious 
intentions or academic misconduct to researchers (Johnson and Daviss, 
McDormand, Villar, Glezerman, the depression scientists from last week), hasty 
generalization (Colorado midwives association), conclusions from anecdotal 
evidence (individidual homebirth stories), appeals to emotion (630 babies will 
be killed by breech deliveries!!!), and numerous strawman (midwives demean 
women who want epidurals, for example). And appeals to common practice 
(that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s done, so it must be right).</p>

<p>Most people eating organic food aren&rsquo;t longing for a past that never

Nothing makes me more annoying than the fallacy that organic = ancient 
production methods. Having worked in a science department at ag school that did 
work on organic production methods, let me tell you they were&rsquo;t using 
horse-drawn ploughs. What they were doing is developing alternative methods to 
improving productivity to rival Monsanto &amp; Co. using SCIENCE&hellip;not 
ancient magical augers or buckets drawn by goats. You should really attend a 
real organic ag conference&hellip;all the presentations are about science. 
Maybe you are confusing biodynamic, which is about ancient magical stuff, with 
organic.</p>

<p>It does seem very much like blogging at SBM is about 
career/reputation/audience/customer building for Dr Tuteur and not actually 
about truly being a skeptical blogger and supporter of the practice of SBM. She 
reminds me of Penn &amp; Teller (who I find entertaining but who veer into 
pseudo-skepticism and sensationalism, and have professional ties with industry 
that blatantly influence what they promote at times). Why does it appear this 
way?</p> 
<p>1-Dr Tuteur appears to use the blogosphere to promote herself as a product 
(a book, an iphone application, &ldquo;personal advice&rdquo; for sale on her 
own blog). Kind of odd at SBM since other doctors who use their credentials or 
professional authority to sell opinions, woo/ideologies or products/books are 
regularly taken to task here (and rightly so). There&rsquo;s a commercial 
driven conflict of interest here that the other SBM bloggers simply don&rsquo;t 
have (that I&rsquo;m aware of anyway, most seem very, very ethical in this 
regard and have no monetary interest in skeptical blogging or promoting a 
public image of themselves as skeptical&hellip;as retired or practicing doctors 
and researchers they generally seem to genuinely care about good science and 
medical practices).</p> 
<p>2-Dr Tuteur doesn&rsquo;t seem to actually be as engaged in practicing 
professional medicine or academic research as much as she is with promoting 
herself as a commercial medical expert/brand (with associated products, 
including her reputation/expertise, to sell at $4.95 a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; 
email&hellip;medical advice by email&hellip;really? What&rsquo;s next? Fortune 
telling?). Actually it&rsquo;s pretty clear that despite liking to be sciency 
and elevating herself on an SBM soapbox to legitimitize her opinions, Dr Tuteur 
isn&rsquo;t actually experienced as a medical researcher and is hostile to 
researchers that don&rsquo;t support her ideological position (going so far as 
to make ad hominem attacks on them and casting aspersions on their 
professionalism). Hence the cargo cult aspect of her presenting as an SBM 
blogger.</p> 
<p>3-Then, like many dodgy experts there&rsquo;s incomplete bio info to be 
able to properly contextualize her expertise (fair enough in PR terms to 
promote what sells, a bit dodgy in SBM terms not to provide full disclosure 
regarding current and past professional experience). She reminds me of Dr Phil 
in this regard (the mistaking folksy &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; for actual 
scientific evidence, the vagueness about current credentials, the down home 
cosiness of using a first name, etc). There&rsquo;s no disclosure on her bio 
here on SBM that she&rsquo;s got commercial interests that involve selling her 
&ldquo;expert&rdquo; opinion&hellip;or that increasing traffic to her own site 
by being controversial here or elsewhere may well bring her increased profits 
and at the very least improves her visibility and, with SBM&rsquo;s blessing, 
her brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and marketability. In PR the 
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no bad publicity&rdquo; motto is common because it&rsquo;s 
all about visibility and being in opposition to another brand (natural 
childbirth) makes business sense. In SBM blogging and scientific research, good 
reputation and scientific authority can be greatly damaged by bad publicity 
based on bad behavior and promoting bad science.</p> 
<p>4-Dr Tuteur uses all the same tactics as woo merchants in trying to 
discredit commenters, research scientists who don&rsquo;t support her opinion 
and those she&rsquo;s in financial competition with; in cherry picking the 
science she presents to support her pre-existing opinion and doing a cargo cult 
ritual of being scientific; and by trying to pass off opinion as SBM. The fact 
that she&rsquo;s critical of anything &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and seems to 
associate anything medical that isn&rsquo;t pharmaceutical or surgical with 
woo, and is totally uncritical of pharmaceutical companies and the commercial 
aspects of medicine, makes her a one sided pseudo-skeptic. (Besides, what 
isn&rsquo;t natural for goodnesses sake?! talk about perpetuating a false idea 
about nature and reality!)</p> 
<p>5-She&rsquo;s also acting exactly like woo merchants when she claims 
she&rsquo;s being &ldquo;censored&rdquo; when she&rsquo;s being called on doing 
the things woo merchants do, or when she claims everyone else is being 
emotional and she&rsquo;s being scientific (when all she&rsquo;s doing is 
projecting her own motivations on others or making unfounded accusations), or 
when she writes something incorrect and then goes back and changes it after the 
fact and then claims people have misunderstood what she wrote and are 
&ldquo;out to get her.&rdquo; Another very problematic habit she has is that 
she pontificates and claims expertize in areas where she&rsquo;s very clearly 
not at all up on the latest research or qualified as an expert in! (And yet she 
mades ad hominem attacks on actual experts in the field and accuses them of 
bias!)</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty outrageous (but interesting) to watch all this unfold on 
an SBM blog. It also makes me curious as to how she ended up blogging 
here&hellip;. How did she? Who recommended her? Where they aware that she makes 
money selling herself as a &ldquo;skeptical blogger&rdquo; and Dr Amy is a 
brand and not really just an SBM blogger without these kinds of conflicts of 
interest?</p> </li>

<p>Yes, I just discovered that she charges for &ldquo;expert advice&rdquo;! 
I&rsquo;m really pretty surprised that the SBM editors think this is okay if 
they knew about it. And to be clear, making a living as a practicing physician 
or medical researcher is a different thing in the context of SBM blogging 
&ndash; if one is honest about their professional affiliations &ndash; than 
making a living selling oneself as a brand or commercial expert where the 
blogging is part of your PR, branding or reputation building and is actually 
part of making a profit. It&rsquo;s not like being an SBM blogger actually 
makes you more money as a physician or is a source of income &ndash; and if 
you&rsquo;re a truly skeptical blogger that takes on unscientific medicine 
across the board then it may even harm your chances of being hired or promoted.
</p> 
<p>Of course, now that I know that Ask Dr Amy is a commercial site and Dr 
Tuteur is selling herself/her identity as a brand, it makes many of her tactics 
here make more sense than they first did to me. It&rsquo;s why context matters 
for understanding anything &ndash; be it a scientific study or an opinion 
piece. Context and how inappropriate to the context of SBM Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s 
post were is what first made the alarms go off for me because her posts are so 
similar to those of CAM cargo cult science bloggers and her tactics are no 
different than sketchy PR image management shenanigans&hellip;walks like a 
duck, quacks like duck&hellip;produces and sells quackery like online medical 
advice (for entertainment purposes and not meant as medical advice of 
course)&hellip;.hmmm&hellip;. What I would really like to know at this point is 
how Dr Tuteur came to be blogging at SBM and if the editors knew about her 
commercial interests when they hired her and, if they did, why they don&rsquo;t 
see this as a conflict of interest or at least worthy of disclosure in her

<p>Amy,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Alex Knapp (not one of the 5) had the virtue of at least being honest about 
his motivations. He has a personal stake in whether I am right or wrong. He has 
adopted the paleo diet because he is sure it will keep him healthy, and if 
I&rsquo;m right, he has been wasting his time. Even more importantly, if 
I&rsquo;m right, he has a lot less control over his health than he&rsquo;d like 
to think.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what you&rsquo;re getting at. Don&rsquo;t we <i>all
</i> have a stake in our personal healths? I mean, I&rsquo;m interested in 
Science-Based Medicine in the first place because I want to know what the best 
treatments are for particular conditions. I have an annual physical with my 
doctor because I want to ensure that I&rsquo;m in the best possible health I 
can be because the best available evidence indicates that regular checkups help 
to promote health. Likewise, I eat a paleo diet because the best available, 
peer-reviewed medical research that I can find indicates that it&rsquo;s the 
best way to lower the risk factors for chronic conditions such as heart 
disease, diabetes, etc.</p> 
<p>You keep insisting that I &ldquo;wasting my time,&rdquo; in adopting a diet 
geared towards lowering my risk factors for chronic disease but you have 
consistently failed to back up your statements with any citations to the 
literature to demonstrate that my position is false. You say that diabetes is a 
condition of old age, and yet in the Lindeberg 2007 study I cited above, 
it&rsquo;s worth noting that of the Type II diabetics who were given a paleo 
diet, every single one had normal fasting glucose levels and normal insulin 
sensitivity by the end of the study. Every single one. And this article 
isn&rsquo;t an outlier or the only piece of research demonstrating similar 
results, either. This greatly undercuts your thesis that Type II Diabetes is 
merely a disease of old age.</p> 
<p>Every time you have asked me for research to support my claims, I have 
provided it. So now let me ask you this: what is your evidence to support your 
thesis that diet has no impact on risk factors for heart disease and diabetes?
</p> 
<p>And if you reply with a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re twisting my words&rdquo; 
argument, feel free to clarify your position. I simply ask that you support 
whatever position that you do hold with actual evidence.</p> </li>

<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; It&rsquo;s not particularly relevant how much money you 
make at the moment by selling your expertize on your Ask Dr Amy website, being 
unsuccessful doesn&rsquo;t mean you haven&rsquo;t tried to commercialize your 
expertize and that you aren&rsquo;t trying to sell medical expertize online. 
Nor does it mean you&rsquo;re not overly invested in maintaining a public image 
or protecting a brand in a way that creates a conflict of interest on an SBM 
site. (And may cause some confusion for you regarding SBM as a practice and 
your professional/personal identity as a &ldquo;skeptical blogger&rdquo; that 
means ego comes into play in areas that should be about evidence.)</p> 
<p>You may have fooled some people with your posturing as an SBM blogger and 
skeptic &ndash; just like CAM and antivax pseudoskeptics and climate change 
deniers fool some people by posturing as if they&rsquo;re promoting science and 
skepticism &ndash; but you&rsquo;re actually pretty easy to spot for anyone who 
is a critical thinker familiar with certain PR/propaganda/debating techniques 
and who isn&rsquo;t just looking to affirm a particular bias they share with 
you. (The fact that you constantly assume that anyone who critiques you is 
promoter of your pet peeves and not an advocate of SBM only strengthens the 
impression you&rsquo;re into black/white thinking and not actually SBM.)</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re particularly easy to spot for those of us who are familiar 
with the tactics used by people peddling CAM pseudoscience (and 
marketing/propaganda techniques). You don&rsquo;t actually need to be able to 
analyze all the scientific studies to do this as a skeptical thinker, there are 
rote clich&eacute;s and tactics that get used when people are doing cargo cult 
science blogging or misrepresenting ideology as being evidence/science-based 
and you&rsquo;ve used most of them. Also, if one is at all interested in basic 
cognitive science or psychology then it&rsquo;s easy to spot the cognitive 
traps us humans fall into unconsciously if we&rsquo;re not on guard for them, 
and sometimes even when we are. You really don&rsquo;t seem to be very well 
informed in these areas (but then you&rsquo;ve expressed some hostility towards 
cognitive science and psychology and seem to equate then with woo so 
that&rsquo;s not surprising).</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s plenty of revenue from carrying GoogleAds for sites 
like this -&gt;http://www.ourpregnancymiracle.com&rdquo;</p>

<li> # Fifi <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 2:01 pm </em> 
<p>Dr Tuteur &ndash; My repeating my analysis of the way you communicate can 
certainly be brushed off as personal opinion. You keep doing the same things 
over and over again, so I point them out again. (For instance, you were called 
out on your very first blog for inappropriately accusing researchers of having 
nefarious motives and fiddling data &ndash; an emotional and ad hominem attack 
&ndash; and then you did exactly the same thing again in your blog about 
antidepressants. Yet you cherry pick data to promote a personal opinion over 
and over again&hellip;this particular blog post was pretty much nothing but 
personal opinion about an area you&rsquo;re clearly no expert in!)</p> 
<p>Since you keep making the same claims to be being victimized and projecting 
motivations onto commenters here over and over again as if doing so makes it 
true, clearly you don&rsquo;t actually have a problem with that kind of thing 
when you&rsquo;re doing it yourself! When you start acting like a reasonable 
SBM blogger instead of behaving like a desperate narcissist frantically engaged 
in image control, you&rsquo;ll get treated like the other SBM bloggers do. Your 
personal narrative about the kinds of responses you get is as faulty as it is 
self-aggrandizing &ndash; it&rsquo;s also very familiar from antivaxers and the 
most nutty alt med promoters!</p> </li> 
<li> # Plonit <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 2:11 pm </em> 
<p>Exsqueeze me? Midwives in the UK get paid for doing their job (which

take on SBM (or indeed in yoga). So&hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure what your

<p>Yes, I comment a lot. As I stated upthread: <i>&ldquo;I follow her blog for 
the community of argumentative commenters that she builds.&rdquo;</i> I 
haven&rsquo;t gone through every single comment, but in my first 14 comments I 
responded to you 5 times and to other commenters 11 times.</p>

<li> # Fifi <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 2:16 pm </em> 
<p>Heh. Plonit is a practicing health professional like the practicing doctors 
and researchers who blog and comment on this site are &ndash; it&rsquo;s not at 
all the same as selling yourself as a brand or online expert (plus plonit is 
not promoting herself professionally, she&rsquo;s discussing medical issues and 
the evidence using a pseudonym). Sure she makes her living as a midwife but she 
does so as a part of a medical system where she isn&rsquo;t competing for 
customers and works cooperatively with OBs. You may as well accuse Dr Gorski of 
having a conflict of interest or any of the other working medical professionals 
here. However, none of them stand to profit from writing their blogs (or 
commenting here). You stand alone in being in the position of having a 
commercial aspect to your identity as an online &ldquo;skeptical&rdquo; blogger 
and are clearly marketing a Dr Amy brand and not just sharing professional 
expertize regarding SBM or certain issues.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty telling that you can&rsquo;t actually discern what is and 
isn&rsquo;t a conflict of interest!</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 2:25 pm </em> 
<p>Some of my posts are getting delayed by &ldquo;waiting in moderation&rdquo;

emotional claim that we are trying to censor her I do enjoy irony! (And am well 
aware that it&rsquo;s more likely a software thing and not a personal attempt 
to silence &ndash; self mocking sarcasm on &ndash; my oh so powerful commentary 
because Dr Tuteur is so scared of my insights and how I challenge her deeply 
held beliefs! Sarcasm off/ that said, she does seem to mistake critique of 
style or content as a personal attack and be fond of using ad hominem attacks 
against researchers she&rsquo;s writing about and doesn&rsquo;t agree with.)</p>

<p>In all fairness, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. I&rsquo;m paid for my 
other blogging gig. It&rsquo;s not a lot compared to what I make at my real 
job, but it&rsquo;s not just a few bucks a month, either, and it&rsquo;s based 
on traffic. One could argue that I have a conflict of interest in maintaing 
that other persona. On the other hand, I try hard to keep that persona (mostly) 
separate from my work at SBM, although regular readers of both recognize that 
from time to time I crosspost. Sometimes I recycle text between the two, 
although hopefully in the context of making two sufficiently different posts 
that they&rsquo;re both worth reading. Sometimes I resurrect old posts from my 
other blog that I am particularly proud of and update them for SBM. Sometimes I 
cobble together old posts from my blog relevant to the topic at hand, update 
them, and add a new section about whatever new development that inspired my 
post. Most of the time, though, I write new material for SBM.</p> </li>

<p>Plonit -</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to criticize Amy on the basis of her 
Google ads. As the owner of a site that runs Google ads myself, I know that you 
have virtually no control over what pops up&ndash;often to great frustration. 
For example, when I was commenting on one of SBM&rsquo;s great takedowns of 
acupuncture on my blog and went further on about it (acupuncture being 
something I can&rsquo;t help railing against), it was only natural that ads FOR 
acupuncture showed up!</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 2:41 pm </em> 
<p>Plonit &ndash; To be fair, most site owners have little control over which 
google ads appear on the site. I wouldn&rsquo;t even take issue with google ads 
really myself. For me the issue is that she sells medical advice online as part 
of her Ask Dr Amy brand (and it&rsquo;s as a &ldquo;premium service&rdquo;). 
When I looked up ownership of the site, it was indicated that she also owns 
other domain names. I have no idea if any of them are active or make any money 
(or if that&rsquo;s accurate, but then I don&rsquo;t trust Dr Tuteur to be 
honest either at this point anyway). However an SBM blogger really should be 
giving full disclosure regarding their commercial interests and associations 
&ndash; being transparent about one&rsquo;s associations is a pretty basic part 
of being ethical in science and SBM blogging too!</p>

<p>Dr Gorski &ndash; Thanks for being open about it and owning up to how you 
may have a conflict of interest that you need to be aware of. I wasn&rsquo;t 
aware of your other blogging gig was paid but I was aware you also blogged 
under a (notorious) pseudonym elsewhere because you mention it in your bio. 
Since you don&rsquo;t mention what it is or link to it though, you&rsquo;re 
hardly using this blog to drive traffic there. (Though perhaps NOT giving out 
the info and mentioning notoriety is a clever bait and switch type of scheme to 
get us all out there trying to solve the puzzle&hellip;mouhahaha.) No, 
seriously, you seem to have managed to divide the two in an ethical and honest 
way &ndash; unless it&rsquo;s Big Pharma or Big sCAM paying you to blog or some 
such and then it would be relevant because of the potential influence on what 
you publish here.</p> 
<p>Conflicts of interest and confirmation biases happen &ndash; it&rsquo;s 
just part of reality and part of SBM is being honest about these things and 
mitigating their effect as much as possible. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been 
taking issue with how Dr Tuteur makes her arguments (accusing research 
scientists of being biased simply because she disagrees with them and they 
don&rsquo;t confirm her biases, and using so many of the same emotive, 
sensationalizing and flat out dishonest tactics that are so often critiqued by 
bloggers on this very site&hellip;even Dr Tuteur while she&rsquo;s busy doing 
the same thing!)</p> </li>

<p>I think Plonit was being tongue in cheek with her comment about Dr. 
Tuteur&rsquo;s ad revenue.</p> 
<p>So doctors don&rsquo;t get paid to blog here? Why does Dr. Tuteur never 
write new material for the blog like everybody else? I have to say the number 
one reason for me reading this particular website (as simple as it sounds) is 
that there are no ads and I can change the size of the text. But then, what is

<p>As far as the discussion of Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s style, I think most medical 
doctors would recognize the style as a provocative style of teaching used by 
attending physicians and residents to get medical students to think for 
themselves. The goal of the style was to teach students how to think, beyond 
just regurgitate facts for a test. There is a difficult transition for a 
medical student graduating from the task of answering questions on a test, to 
the task of making decisions to help a patient. The attending would often make 
a statement that would result in a lot of discussion, but a lot of errors in 
thought processes would be revealed and opened up for criticism. That was a 
process not easily duplicated on a test. Usually the statements by the 
attending were carefully crafted (often by years of experience and repetition) 
to scatter traps for unsuspecting students.</p> 
<p>I used to teach in medical school. I remember how a group of PhD educators 
complained about my use of such techniques in computer aided instruction. Such 
a style is not common in general education, but common in medical education. Is 
it justified? That&rsquo;s a matter of opinion. However, it is effective at 
getting some students to be much more circumspect about how to solve a problem 
using medical literature. It is pretty hard to come up with other methods of 
teaching problem solving, other than practical experience. It is an attempt to 
develop some skills in medical students before they assume responsibility for 
care of a patient as a resident. While the teaching could be pretty harsh, the 
price of incompetence in a resident is high. It does tend to give a unique 
flavor to discussions about science by medical scientists.</p> 
<p>It may seem harsh in a blog, but I can guarantee it is tame compared to 
medical school (although medical schools may now be much kinder and gentler). 
Strip away the emotional overlays, and there is still an underlying emphasis on 
interpretation of scientific evidence. To make a recommendation for a patient 
based on scientific evidence requires a rigorous approach by the professional 
doctor to evaluate scientific evidence. That ability is not easily taught.</p> 
<p>Many medical students didn&rsquo;t like that approach, so the backlash is 
to be expected. I don&rsquo;t think there is any motivation in the approach, 
other than it helped Dr Tuteur, so Dr Tuteur feels others should be exposed to 
the method for possible benefit.</p> 
<p>SBM is not a peer reviewed journal publishing original scientific 
observations, so the articles are not required to have the same rigor in 
observation and citation. The author may request such citations from 
responders, so that the critical review can be applied to such papers.</p> </li>

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s even more like fortune telling since it&rsquo;s about 
telling people their chance of getting pregnant&hellip;oh, wait&hellip;it could 
be either&hellip; Either way, it does seem like it&rsquo;s taking advantage of 
desperate women who should simply be seeing a doctor to either find out if 
they&rsquo;re pregnant or able to become pregnant (both situations that women 
can feel rather anxious and emotional about and both conditions that 
can&rsquo;t really be evaluated via email in any meaningful way).</p>

<p>Full disclosure: </p> 
<p>SBM bloggers are not paid. In fact, I had never been paid for any of my 
writing until this January when &ldquo;O, The Oprah Magazine&rdquo; started 
paying me to write a short column. I maintain my own website and I pay for that 
myself. I have never been paid for public speaking, either, except for 
receiving a small honorarium for being on the faculty of The Skeptic&rsquo;s 
Toolbox last summer. I have never been paid anything by Big Pharma and I have 
not even been in the same room with a drug rep in the last three decades. Oh, 
and some of my SBM material is not new: I have reprinted or linked to articles 
I have written for Skeptic, e-Skeptic, and Skeptical Inquirer and to the

<p>JMB &ndash; I don&rsquo;t buy your explanation since there are other 
factors at work here and Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s style and even the content of her 
posts has more to do with how CAM pseudoscience promoters operate than any 
medical scientist or doctor I&rsquo;ve known (including ones that teach). 
There&rsquo;s nothing particularly educational about the way Dr Tuteur writes, 
unlike Dr Crislip, Dr Jones, Dr Gorski or Dr Novella. Sure they sometimes have 
axes they&rsquo;re grinding but they&rsquo;re very rarely simply promoting 
personal opinion about subjects they&rsquo;re not experts in as SBM! Nor are 
they promoting themselves as a brand.</p> </li>

<p>JMB &ndash; I don&rsquo;t expect SBM to be peer reviewed. I do, however, 
expect a blogging collective that calls itself Science-based Medicine and 
purports to support and promote SBM to actually do that. Why? Because otherwise 
all you&rsquo;re doing is giving credence to the critics of SBM in the eyes of 
the public and presenting an image of science that has nothing to do with the 
ethical practice of science or educating the public. This isn&rsquo;t a beat up 
on the interns session, this is SBM blogging that&rsquo;s meant to support SBM 
and educate the public about what is science and what is 
pseudoscience&hellip;or at least I thought that was what this site is about!</p>
<p>Dr Hall &ndash; That&rsquo;s pretty funny that you&rsquo;re writing for 
Oprah&rsquo;s magazine, all things and her history here and with CAM 
considered. No doubt you&rsquo;ll fit right in with &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; 
Dr Phil and Dr Oz who both promote woo and Suzanne Summers&hellip;.hey, maybe 
you&rsquo;ll even get your own TV show. Fun aside, maybe that means she&rsquo;s

but it&rsquo;s pretty time consuming. That said, I&rsquo;ve always found the 
google ads on skeptic sites to be very funny since they&rsquo;re almost always 
advertising woo of some kind. Not much of a problem on a skeptics site really. 
However I can see how it could lead someone visiting a site with questions 
about pregnancy to click on one and wander down the path of woo assuming it was

<p>I tried to verify the claim, but unfortunately, your site is blocked at my 
workplace. (We&rsquo;ve got an overzealous nanny filter, and it blocks a fair 
number of pregnancy-related websites for no good reason.) No matter; you have 
confessed it yourself. Words cannot describe how much this has lowered my 
opinion of you. You accept money to tell strangers, via e-mail, whether or not 
they may be pregnant? And you claim you only do this to cut down on unwanted 
e-mail? Am I misunderstanding something here?</p> 
<p>You know, a simpler (and more ethical) method of cutting down on unwanted 
e-mail is to simply say &ldquo;I will not answer any e-mails requesting medical 
advice&rdquo;, and then simply delete any e-mail that falls into that category. 
That&rsquo;s what most doctor-bloggers (active and retired) do, and it is the 
ethical thing to do. There are also many techniques non-medical bloggers use to 
avoid undesired e-mail in their inbox &mdash; having separate accounts for 
blogging and for personal business, using e-mail filters, etc. This is not a 
problem unique to yourself, and frankly, there are bloggers who put up with a 
lot more than a few hundred e-mails a day. They just have the maturity to draw 
a line in the sand regarding how many they are actually going to read.</p> 
<p>Perhaps there is some way you can explain how charging a fee to give 
medical advice over the Internet is an ethical way to deal with unwanted 
e-mail. If so, I would be interested to hear it.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;You say that diabetes is a condition of old age, and yet in the 
Lindeberg 2007 study I cited above, it&rsquo;s worth noting that of the Type II 
diabetics who were given a paleo diet, every single one had normal fasting 
glucose levels and normal insulin sensitivity by the end of the study. Every 
single one. And this article isn&rsquo;t an outlier or the only piece of 
research demonstrating similar results, either. This greatly undercuts your 
thesis that Type II Diabetes is merely a disease of old age.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Implicit in this statement is the assumption that the diabetes has been 
cured in the study. From the medical viewpoint, this represents successful 
control of the diabetes without insulin or other glucose lowering medications. 
The doctor would expect that the patient is at greater risk for diabetic 
problems when they get older, or endure physiologic stress (surgery, pregnancy, 
severe infection). Some of the patients in the study may never develop overt 
diabetes if they stick to the paleo diet. Some of them will develop overt 
diabetes (requiring glucose lowering medication) within five years, even if 
they stick to the diet.</p> 
<p>Chronic diseases of aging may be regarded as a pathway the patient walks 
down. The pathway is initially set by their inherited characteristics. The 
pathway may be modified by accidents or infectious diseases, as well as genetic 
mutations. The age at which the disease becomes manifest depends on the 
pathway, and how fast they proceed down the pathway. Certain habits affect the 
speed at which we proceed down the pathway. Diet, exercise, stress, and smoking 
all affect the speed at which we proceed down the pathway (smoking, and to a 
lesser diet also affect rate of mutation). Eat a lot, smoke a lot, get no 
exercise, and you will be running, not walking down the pathway. Whether or not 
we can identify signs (high fasting glucose), or symptoms (tiredness, increased 
susceptibility to infections) depends on how far the individual has proceeded 
down the pathway. Through some medical interventions, we might push the patient 
to an earlier point in the pathway. That would eliminate manifestations of the 
disease, but not alter the pathway. A lasting cure would be to alter the 
pathway (transplant islet cells, rejuvenate mitochondria, alter immune 
responses are the current hopes).</p> 
<p>Diet and exercise will delay the onset of type II diabetes in most but not 
all patients. In some patients, that delay will be sufficient that they will 
never suffer the complications of the error in metabolism. Some lucky people 
will never develop diabetes regardless of their diet.</p> 
<p>The interplay of diet, genetics, and aging is a multifactorial process in 
the development of the disease of type II diabetes. However, that interplay of 
factors is why type II diabetes is labeled a disease of aging. It can be 
identified in young people, it can be controlled by diet, but the prevalence of 
disease will increase as the population ages.</p> </li>

<p>Dr Hall &ndash; Actually, what you said was that it didn&rsquo;t influence 
your own position that circumcision is harmless (if I remember correctly) since 
that&rsquo;s what was being argued about since it was your opinion on 
circumcision that was being discussed. What I said was that it MAY and it was 
reasonable enough that it may influence your or another doctor&rsquo;s opinion 
since no one wants to believe they were doing harm to a defenseless child (even 
if they thought it was in the child&rsquo;s best interests at the time). I 
never claimed it ALWAYS creates a bias and obviously many doctors who used to 
do circumcisions no longer do them for ethical reasons and can admit that even 
though they did them at the time because it was routine that they no longer 
consider it good practice. Of course, we could go back to dredge the thread for 
exact quotes if you would like to or feel the need to do so.</p> 
<p>What do you mean by a &ldquo;medical&rdquo; reason to stop doing 
circumcisions? And how is this different than an ethical one (since I&rsquo;d 
hope that medical practices are ethical according to the understandings of the 
time)? I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand what you mean by &ldquo;medical or 
ethical reasons&rdquo; in regards to performing circumcisions!</p> </li>

<p>If there at one time appeared to be evidence of benefit, and then later the

<p>JMB,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Implicit in this statement is the assumption that the diabetes has been

<p>Had that been what I meant, that&rsquo;s what I would have said. What I <i>
said</i> was that fasting glucose declined and insulin sensitivity returned to 
normal levels. Given that the causes of Type II Diabetes are still murky, I 
would hesitate to label this as a cure.</p>

<p>Some of them will develop overt diabetes (requiring glucose lowering

<p>What&rsquo;s your evidence to support this? The incidence of Type II 
Diabetes among the elderly in modern hunter-gatherer populations is virtually 
non-existent. See, for example, the Inuit studies of Otto Schaefer, et. al. in 
the 70s and 80s, which found zero cases of type II diabetes among those Inuit 
who still ate the traditional diet. Lindeberg&rsquo;s Kitavan studies that I 
cited above did not check for incidence of diabetes, but the virtual 
non-existence of ischemic heart disease is suggestive that diabetes rates are 
low among their elderly population as well.</p> 
<p>The incidence of Type II Diabetes was also low among the islanders of 
Okinawa, the population with the longest life expectancy in the world, until 
the past decade, when substantial numbers of people there began adopting an 
American-style diet&ndash;resulting in almost<i>doubling</i> the incidence in a 
13-year span of time. (see e.g. Takasu et al. Influence of Motorization and 
Supermarket-Proliferation on the Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes in the 
Inhabitants of a Small Town on Okinawa, Japan, Internal Medicine Vol. 46 (2007) 
, No. 23 pp.1899-1904).</p> 
<p>There are a significant number of good researchers out there hypothesizing 
that at least some incidences of Type II Diabetes are caused by a diet high in 
grains and refined carbohydrates over a number of years. I think there&rsquo;s 
still a lot of work to do, but it&rsquo;s a strong hypothesis and the data from 
populations eating traditional, non-Western diets is compelling enough for me 
to have cut grains out of my diet in an effort to lower my risk factors for 
chronic diseases.</p> </li>

<p>Plenty of doctors change their practices based on the latest evidence, the 
majority do I&rsquo;d suspect (though I have no evidence of that one way or the 
other). SBM is all about that. However, there are doctors who cling to 
practices or beliefs despite the evidence &ndash; sometimes because it involves 
a pet theory of theirs (this is where doctors often step over the line into 
being quacks) and sometimes because it&rsquo;s a bit horrifying to think you 
did something harmful when your self image is that of a healer (and you 
genuinely are a pretty nice and decent person who was just doing whatever the

<p>I used to think quantity mattered more, too, until I reviewed some of the 
literature on the insulin response to refined carbohydrates and its effect on 
the insulin response, as well as insulin&rsquo;s role in fat storage and 
satiety. This comports with my own personal experience, too. After the first 
couple of weeks of weaning myself off grains, I don&rsquo;t count calories at 
all, but then again I don&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;m hungry less often, and 
when I am hungry it&rsquo;s not the gnawing, &ldquo;dear god I have to eat now 
or I will die&rdquo; hunger. It&rsquo;s, &ldquo;oh dear, I should probably 
consider eating something in the next couple of hours.&rdquo; But when I do 
eat, there&rsquo;s no real skimping. For dinner yesterday I had fried chicken 
(no breading, of course), a salad, and cauliflower with a heavy cream sauce. 
That&rsquo;s a pretty typical meal for me and yet, I lose weight, my 
triglycerides are lower, my blood pressure is lower, my fasting glucose is 
lower, etc.</p> </li>

<p>My point being, I am definitely eating fewer calories than I used to, but 
it&rsquo;s very natural to do so. For me, at least, cutting out grains means 
that I&rsquo;m hungry less often. But that appears to go hand in hand with the 
role of insulin in satiety.</p> </li>

<p>I suspect you&rsquo;re right in many ways but the quality does also seem to

learn what critical thinking entails. Many people take such provocations as 
personal attacks. The key distinction is whether the provocation is trying to 
make the respondent examine their scientific basis. Many of the perceived 
personal attacks on this site were just challenges to the scientific basis.</p> 
<p>Science education isn&rsquo;t just about reading a textbook to determine 
what the consensus of textbook writers determines are scientific facts and 
concepts. We know many of those facts and concepts will change in a short 
period of time. Answers will change over time, but the principles of critical 
thinking have not changed since Galileo. Part of science education is teaching 
the critical approach to information and conclusion. One shortcoming of science 
education in secondary education is the failure to teach critical thinking.</p> 
<p>Can critical thinking be taught without the provocative approach? I 
don&rsquo;t pretend to have a scientific answer. Those with education degrees 
can discuss that. Academic physicians rarely write articles about education 
techniques, so the provocative style is just passed on from generation to 
generation in medical schools. I think it was the subject in a movie about 
legal education (Paper Chase?). The provocative approach is just one more thing 
I adjusted to in medical school (I&rsquo;d like to think I was a critical

<p>Fair enough, both my parents are doctors (one was also a researcher) so I

(much to some of my boring teachers&rsquo; displeasure and my engaged

<p>I agree that many people never learn to think critically, whether 
it&rsquo;s being able to think critically about science or art or literature. 
However, one doesn&rsquo;t need to be provocative to teach critical thinking, 
one needs to teach people how to research, analyse and the basic cognitive 
traps we fall into that create biases that get in the way of seeing reality or 
the facts for what they are. (The comon sense fallacies, the seeing is 
believing fallacies, confirmation biases, etc.) Most of critical thinking 
entails being able to get beyond either/or kind of thinking, which is one of 
the most basic cognitive traps there is (it has nothing to do with 
intelligence, it&rsquo;s just the way our brain is set up for expediency, so 
even intelligent people can fall into this trap). The other problem even 
intelligent people often have is a lack of ability to deconstruct and recognize 
our own personal biases and the biases of our own culture. The only way to 
really get over that one is travel and friends from other cultures, actually 
coming up against other cultures and beliefs so you become aware of your own

myself and growing up around science certainly made me a knowledge junkie and

<p>Hey JJ,</p> 
<p>From just that paper, you&rsquo;re right&ndash;the researchers didn&rsquo;t 
distinguish between the diet and the change in exercise levels, and I 
wouldn&rsquo;t use just that paper to prove my thesis by itself. If it seemed I 
was doing otherwise, my apologies.</p> 
<p>There is some research to suggest that exercise has very little effect on 
obesity or diabetes rates, but from this computer I don&rsquo;t have the 
citations handy. I&rsquo;ll look them up and post later.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;I was explaining that proponents of the provocative style argue that 
if you are to educate people in critical thinking, you must provoke them to 
engage in their own literature research. Only when they get steamed up will 
they really learn what critical thinking entails. Many people take such 
provocations as personal attacks.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Except Dr. Tuteur is the one claiming to be personally attacked when 
somebody questions either her simplistic writing or her &ldquo;authority&rdquo; 
status that she promotes. Nobody else, that I can think of, has said anything 
about feeling attacked personally (although they probably could have, 
particularly &ldquo;outing&rdquo; Plonit as a midwife). On other forums, Dr. 
Tuteur has gone so far to post full name, city, and occupation of anonymous 
posters that she feels threatened by (instead of addressing their points).</p> 
<p>Also, it isn&rsquo;t *only* the same 5 posters calling Dr. Tuteur out on 
her inaccuracies. She has received many negative comments from dozens of 
different posters, including regulars, on here. I&rsquo;ve never seen this for 
another sbm blogger.</p> </li>

<p>To Fifi, I agree that we know far less than we think we know. The smartest 
professors were often more humble because they had learned the limitations of 
their knowledge.</p> 
<p>To Alex Knapp, I have never stated that diet and exercise were not factors 
in the development of diabetes. I was just explaining the model of interaction 
of heredity, age, and diet in the development of diabetes. Anybody that wants 
to minimize their risk of diabetes which watch their diet. Whether there is 
sufficient comparative evidence about which diet is best, can be debated by 
someone with more time and expertise in nutrition than me. There is some 
evidence that simplifies the issue of diet down to what your weight is as a 
result of the diet. Bariatric surgery has been shown in some small series to 
revert type II diabetes more effectively than diet/lifestyle changes, but that 
probably reflects patient compliance as well.</p> </li>

<p>JMB said &ldquo;I was explaining that proponents of the provocative style 
argue that if you are to educate people in critical thinking, you must provoke 
them to engage in their own literature research.&rdquo; If Amy wants this 
&ldquo;method&rdquo; to be effective at &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; readers, she 
must therefore cite references, which she rarely does. So how does that work 
exactly?</p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 9:21 pm </em> 
<p>Make that voluminous reference citations. See Novella&rsquo;s Feb 19 post 
comments where a discussion took place on how it&rsquo;s necessary to read 
multiple primary research sources to arrive at any sort of conclusion, and how 
difficult/expensive it is for lay persons to obtains access to medical journals.

<li> # Zoe237 <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 9:35 pm </em> 
<p>&ldquo;Part of science education is teaching the critical approach to 
information and conclusion. One shortcoming of science education in secondary 
education is the failure to teach critical thinking.<br>
 Can critical thinking 
be taught without the provocative approach? I don&rsquo;t pretend to have a 
scientific answer.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was wondering what the provocative approach was, 
exactly. I certainly have used a &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s advocate&rdquo; position 
in the classroom as the teacher, as well as the Socratic Method. The students 
also rarely knew my personal position on a topic- I wanted them to draw their 
own conclusions, backed by evidence, which is the entire point behind 
education. But I haven&rsquo;t seen any of that from Dr. Tuteur.</p> </li>

<blockquote>

<p>I misunderstood, then. It looked to me like you were assuming that diabetes 
was primarily a question of heredity and age and downplaying diet. I apologize 
for the misunderstanding.</p> </li> 
<li> # JMB <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 9:58 pm </em> 
<p>&ldquo;So how does that work exactly?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The idea is that the student would have an incentive to start with a 
question, find references that may apply, filter those references as to how 
appropriate they are, and analyze their methods and conclusions to arrive at an 
answer. That is a process that the student will gradually get better at with 
practice. If references are supplied, that doesn&rsquo;t fully simulate the 
problem solving situations that may be faced in the practice of medicine.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;and how difficult/expensive it is for lay persons to obtains access 
to medical journals.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>While some in academic medicine may enjoy full support of a librarian and a 
nearby library of medicine, those in private practice are faced with the same 
problems as the lay person. Too bad it isn&rsquo;t a requirement that all 
research supported by public funding, or performed at schools supported with 
public funding, be made freely available. Most of the difficulty in finding a 
reference to cite in this blog, is to find one that is freely available.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;However, one doesn&rsquo;t need to be provocative to teach critical 
thinking,&rdquo;</p> 
<p>What worked for you might not work for someone else. Different students 
respond to different methods of teaching. If a faculty member is faced with a 
student who don&rsquo;t seem to be making adequate progress in developing 
critical thinking, then the teacher might resort to a different method of 
teaching (moving from a nuturing style to a more provocative style). It 
didn&rsquo;t always work.</p> </li> 
<li> # JMB <em>on 22 Feb 2010 at 10:10 pm </em> 
<p>I guess the incentive in the provocative approach was, &ldquo;Get mad at 
me, then go prove me wrong.&rdquo; Some attendings would even make invalid 
statements, to see who could come up with the best evidence to prove them wrong.

<p>JMB thanks for clarification. In the medical school situation, if a student 
presented legitimate reference citations at odds with the professor&rsquo;s 
teachings how did the professor react? Does the professor summarily dismisses 
legitimate research that conflicts with his/her theories, while not providing 
any evidence for his/her theories? Did Amy learn this method in medical school 
too? And what about the use of qualifiers when communicating? I find it hard to 
believe that medical school information is taught entirely as absolutes&hellip;

<p>Most students got credit for attempting a literature review if they cited 
references to studies published in recognized peer review journals, regardless 
of whether it agreed with the professor&rsquo;s opinion. If the student&rsquo;s 
analysis was based on less renown journals, then it would tend to be dismissed 
without much comment. That is one of the similarities in approach I recognized. 
What the student learned was to pay attention to the credibility of the source. 
Now, I am not saying that approach is right for a discussion of SBM, I am just 
saying that is how we were taught in medical school. It is important to learn 
that different scientific approaches yield different degrees of quality of 
information that can be used to make a medical decision. However, that judgment 
of the quality of the source is an easy way for biases to enter the process.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for Dr Tuteur, I just recognized a style of teaching and a 
thread of scientific reasoning in the earlier posts that triggered my memories. 
Whether that is her method, only she knows. I don&rsquo;t know if she was 
subjected to that as a student, or if she taught in an academic medical center. 
Part of the job as a resident is to teach those with less experience, so most 
doctors have some limited teaching experience. Doctors&rsquo; experiences in 
training are not uniform. I think I was exposed to fairly harsh methods (there 
was significant morbidity and mortality in my cohort of medical students), more 
modern teaching programs may have evolved beyond that.</p> </li>

if you believe that impact is placed above accuracy on a hierarchy of effective

<p>I suppose I have to say it yet again:</p> 
<p>I was responding to posters who claimed that Amy&rsquo;s opinions on what 
the evidence says is different to Harriet&rsquo;s opinion on what the evidence 
says. I demonstrated that this was not the case and that their views are almost 
the same. Amy uses brevity for impact, Harriet uses all the qualifiers that Amy 
merely implies, but there is no disagreement and Amy demonstrated when she 
unhesitatingly accepted that large paragraph of qualifiers that I offered 
regarding herbal treatments.</p>

<p>How is Amy prompting readers to substitute their own intuitions and biases 
for objective fact. In fact, she almost does the reverse. She almost shoves the 
facts &ndash; condensed for clarity and impact &ndash; down your throat! 
&ldquo;CAM is useless&rdquo; The objective facts are that CAM is useless except 
for [add a large paragraph of qualifiers which add much to the statement that

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen similar done in art school, but the difference is that 
when you disagree they do not attempt to discredit you by claiming you are just 
out to get them or that you are part of a &ldquo;insert group here&rdquo;

<p>All I can say if you are trying to use that style you should be a lot 
tighter in your evidence and logic than this article.</p> 
<p>Firstly who are these alternative health people? Not alternative medicine, 
health. For that matter what is mainstream health? How are they the same and 
how do they differ. I am to belief that alternative health believes that the 
past was a paradise. Example? who, said what when to demonstrate that?To 
dispute these hypothetical (strawmen)) &ldquo;Far from being a paradise, it was 
hell.&rdquo; Well gosh, subjective much? Sure, I&rsquo;d experience it as hell, 
but then in some possible future there may be millions of people thinking that 
our life is hell. Does that mean it really is?</p> 
<p>As I see it whether the past was a paradise or not is pointless. There were 
positive aspects and negative aspects. Today there are positive aspects and 
negative aspects. We look to science to help us build on the positive and 
eliminate the negative. I&rsquo;d much rather read about science than some

<li> # wales <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 9:08 am </em> 
<p>JMB thanks for taking time to explain your point of view. If indeed this is 
Amy&rsquo;s modus operandi, I question the belief that this method would be as 
effective in the real world. It might work in medical school, where the 
students are a captive audience and where the entire ritual of enrolling in 
school, paying tuition, and knowing a degree is received at the end reinforces 
the proscribed roles of student and teacher and supports the learning process, 
no matter how angry the student feels about the teacher. I have doubts that 
this method can be effectively transferred outside of academia. In a world 
where we are bombarded by bombastic and sensationalized news reporting and 
blogging this harsh teaching method doesn&rsquo;t have the support and captive 
audience proffered by the halls of academia. Emulating the Fox News model (or 
appearing to do so) would seem to narrow the teaching possibilities rather than 
broaden them, in terms of actually reaching a prospective audience.</p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 9:43 am </em> 
<p>To clarify my point, in the medical school method being discussed, the 
stick and carrot are being employed simultaneously, and the students are 
invested in (literally) obtaining that carrot. In the real world (or blogging 
world) there are multiple methods for obtaining the carrot, other than being 
subjected to the stick. And since, as Amy pointed out, a large number of the 
comments she generates are from a small group of individuals, it would seem 
there is a small group of prospective students. End of observation.</p> 
<p>Billy Joe, I apologize for interpreting your comments as support of one 
method or the other. That was my perception, not necessarily your message.</p>

threatened? You&rsquo;ll throw anything against the wall to see if it will 
stick in the hope that you can convince yourself and others that they 
don&rsquo;t have to listen to me. It&rsquo;s not working.</p> 
<p>Do you know how many questions I get each month? One or two. I instituted

know you can&rsquo;t win?<br>
 
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
<br> So, let me get this straight. You have a website called &ldquo;Ask Dr.

number of people contacting you with their personal questions? Wouldn&rsquo;t 
it just be easier and more ethical to refer women to their own ob-gyns with 
their personalized fertility questions, as those ob-gyns are authorized to give 
actual medical advice?</p> 
<p>The disclaimer from your site says, </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Disclaimer: Dr. Amy does not and cannot provide medical advice. Only 
someone who has examined you and reviewed your medical records can provide 
advice. Dr. Amy offers explanations and information.<br>
 Dr. Amy Tuteur is an

Your Baby is Born, an illustrated guide to pregnancy, labor and delivery, was 
published by Ziff-Davis Press in 1994.&rdquo;</p>

gosh, subjective much? Sure, I&rsquo;d experience it as hell, but then in some 
possible future there may be millions of people thinking that our life is hell. 
Does that mean it really is?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Exactly! These kinds of value judgments based on personal perceptions 
instead of evidence are equally as meaningless when promoted by either side 
that&rsquo;s fanatically attached to ideas about the past or 
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; life (&ldquo;modern&rdquo; is so quaint and retro to 
use&hellip;such &ldquo;better living through chemistry&rdquo; science 
romanticism!). Both are also equally tied up in very colonialist (and 
incorrect) ideas about other cultures (and our own) that date back mainly to 
the late 1700s and 1800s. If one is going to talk about history and culture, 
it&rsquo;s worth knowing a bit about history and culture instead of just 
promoting what is essentially anthropological woo!</p> 
<p>Neither of these romantic notions are being particularly realistic and both 
are clearly reactionary and ideological. One is presenting a naturalist 
fallacy, the other is presenting a techno-industrial fallacy. Neither is 
actually in line with how anthropologists and archeologists (contemporary ones 
at least) view or discuss past cultures (or present existant ones other than 
our own). And both are rejecting science for ideology (apparently technology 
and science are one and the same in Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s mind).</p> 
<p>One belief system involves creating fantasies about the past and nature as 
a reaction against fears about the future and present, the other is creating 
fantasies about the past, present and future, and technology, out of a desire 
not to see reality as it actually is so as to avoid recognizing the potential 
longterm consequences of our actions. Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s apparent prejudice 
against preventative medicine &ndash; and cognitive science and psychology 
&ndash; isn&rsquo;t very surprising when you see how it&rsquo;s connected to 
her belief system regarding actions and consequences. It also seems just as 
fear based as the beliefs of those who cling to naturalist fallacies, 
it&rsquo;s just that Dr Tuteur seems to think that technology is infallible and 
the &ldquo;all good&rdquo; magic to ward off scary nature instead of believing 
the naturalist fallacy that one can appease nature by being &ldquo;good&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;in harmony&rdquo;. Both are pretty silly positions and neither are 
actually based in reality!</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 11:24 am </em> 
<p>StatlerWaldorf &ndash; I&rsquo;d suspect it&rsquo;s illegal to give medical 
advice over the internet (in this kind of context, legitimate telehealth setups 
associated with reputable health institutions can be very useful for remote 
communities). All in all, it seems pretty spectacularly unethical to be 
proposing one can tell someone via email whether their chances of being or 
getting pregnant are good or not. As you rightly point out, we have no idea if 
Dr Tuteur still holds a medical license and she does give the impression 
she&rsquo;s a practicing Ob/Gyn on her site. Apart from not being nearly as 
successful, I can&rsquo;t see how this is particularly different than what the 
Dr Phils and Mercolas and other TV/internet medical charlatans are doing. 
Particularly since Dr Tuteur just made an excuse for doing it and tried to 
brush it under the carpet by once again claiming that she&rsquo;s being 
victimized simply because someone pointed out that she&rsquo;s engaging in 
unethical behavior that certainly isn&rsquo;t in line with what one would 
expect from someone who claims to be an advocate of SBM!</p> </li>

to see if someone&rsquo;s words and actions align and what their general 
integrity level is. Just because someone is an SBM blogger and claims to be a 
skeptic doesn&rsquo;t mean they actually are one. (Perhaps Dr Tuteur confuses 
cynicism with skepticism?) While I don&rsquo;t always agree on all matters with 
all the (other) bloggers who are part of the SBM collective, I generally have 
found that the integrity level is pretty high and most can be trusted to be 
honest and provide insightful analysis. Hey, even when there&rsquo;s the odd 
confirmation bias or ideological issue it&rsquo;s usually pretty minor and 
doesn&rsquo;t really impact the actual science being discussed. Hey,

woo and pseudoscience is to try to make out that SBM isn&rsquo;t trustworthy 
and is merely a front for industry or is financially self-serving, it seems 
crucially important that SBM bloggers actually be pretty spotlessly ethical and 
not blatantly engaged in the same kinds of mercenary activities as the more 
nefarious woo merchants. You can&rsquo;t be a trustworthy whistleblower if 
you&rsquo;re doing all kinds of unethical things yourself! That said, it IS 
interesting and kind of nice to see that &ldquo;skeptic&rdquo; as a brand or 
label is becoming marketable (though unfortunate that it&rsquo;s often 
pseudoskepticism that&rsquo;s being sold since most actual skeptics seem to 
view educating others about skepticism as more of a public service than a 
commercial endeavor). I am skeptical of the commercial promotion of skepticism 
as a brand rather than as a means to better understand reality and the world.

<p>Given Amy&rsquo;s stance at sbm on toxins I would expect to see her 
advising parents not to waste their money on the more expensive chlorine free 
diapers and organic baby food because there is no &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; that 
diapers bleached with chlorine and food grown with chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides pose any harm to babies.</p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 5:46 pm </em> 
<p>Michele: I think the theory is that the &ldquo;environmental thing&rdquo; 
is a toxin thing via chlorine leaking into landfills and groundwater(which 
makes sense to me). And also perhaps that chlorine residue on diapers is toxic 
to infants.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 5:47 pm </em> 
<p>michele &ndash; &ldquo;I thought the chlorine free aspects of diapers was 
more of an environmental thing (chlorine processing, bleaching, going into 
groundwater, etc).&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I would have thought that too but they&rsquo;re not marketed that way.</p> 
<p>Seventh Generation offers a safe conventional diaper without dangerous 
toxins. Keep your baby dry and comfortable in between changes and through the 
night, and go chlorine free at the same time.</p> 
<p>In addition to being effective at keeping baby dry and reducing the risk of 
diaper rash, studies show that our absorbent polymer is non-toxic and 
non-irritating to baby&rsquo;s sensitive skin.</p> 
<p>Features:</p> 
<p>Hypoallergenic<br>
 Cloth-like covering<br>
 Premium fit and absorbency<br>

 Resealable tapes &amp; stretchy leg gathers<br>
 Fragrance and latex free<br>
 
Most diapers have been bleached with chlorine, which creates dangerous toxins 
(i.e. dioxin, furans and other organochlorines) that accumulate in both people 
and animals. Choose wisely!</p> </li> 
<li> # Zoe237 <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 5:50 pm </em> 
<p>Organic babyfood? Profiting off of those who are &ldquo;longing for a past 
that never existed&rdquo; given this exact blog post talking about the 
stupidity of people who are concerned about pesticides? Huh, enjoying the irony.
</p> 
<p>If she were so concerned about the amount of email comments about pregnancy 
she was getting, I guess she could have called it dontaskdramy.com instead of 
charging people $14.95 for an email from a doctor whose been retired for over 
15 years.</p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 5:51 pm </em> 
<p>If you agree with Amy&rsquo;s stance on toxins, chlorine leaching into the 
soil and groundwater shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. So it&rsquo;s still 
hypocritical to sell these products. Whichever reason draws parents to chlorine 
free diapers is a result of perceived toxins either in the environment or on 
the baby.</p> </li> 
<li> # wales <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 5:55 pm </em> 
<p>So which is it? Is Amy a cynical skeptic who doesn&rsquo;t believe in 
toxins but panders to the publics fear of toxins? Or is she a believer in 
toxins who pretends to be a non-believeing skeptic? Or just a good old 
fashioned American salesperson who believes the public should have options to 
waste their money whichever way they wish to?</p> </li>

<p>FiFi &ndash; sorry, I was going from past memory of my diapering days and 
the amazon description&hellip;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Hypo-allergenic and offering soft, cloth-like comfort and premium 
absorbency, these diapers are made of chlorine-free absorbent materials that do 
not contribute to dioxin pollution.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But your quote does have a different spin, My bad.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 23 Feb 2010 at 6:56 pm </em> 
<p>michele &ndash; What you said made total sense and I&rsquo;d have thought 
it was mainly about the processing and environmental pollution myself but the 
marketing does play on parental fears (reality based or not) of their children 
being exposed to toxins.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why people get so bent out of shape about 
organic food or farming. It&rsquo;s not like anyone&rsquo;s forcing them to 
buy, grow or eat organic food, or support it financially. On the other hand, 
almost all of us in North America indirectly financially support factory 
farming of various kinds through all kinds of government subsidies given out 
&ndash; even if we choose to support local or organic agriculture by buying 
organic or local produce our tax dollars still support factory farming.</p>

to treat childhood illnesses including asthma. The short phrases without

<p>Had he been talking about lower back pain, he would no doubt have been more 
long-winded, discussing the evidence that chiropractic manipulations appear 
help and discussig whether this was because of &lsquo;subluxions&rsquo; or just 
because chiropractic is similar to other sorts of hands on stuff which also 
appears to help like massage, osteopathy etc&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>BillyJoe &ndash; Actually, I&rsquo;d rather see Singh&rsquo;s quotes in 
context since he&rsquo;s actually not just making non-evidence based assertions 
and generalizations as you seem to think he is when you see him quoted out of 
context. Just because I agree with Singh (a confirmation bias) and know what 
he&rsquo;s talking about (the context) doesn&rsquo;t actually mean that the 
quotes you&rsquo;ve presented are any more legitimate than any other opinion 
proffered without evidence.</p> 
<p>And, in many ways Singh is doing the same things as a journalist that some 
bloggers here complain about when science writers do them regarding things they 
don&rsquo;t agree about (using anecdotes, making assertions about evidence 
without presenting the actual evidence, relying upon an expert rather than 
analysing the data himself, etc). I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that but 
then I don&rsquo;t have unrealistic expectations of journalism (or science, 
medicine or doctors for that matter&hellip;though I may apparently have 
unrealistic expectations regarding the integrity of SBM bloggers practicing 
what they preach and going by the same rules as ethical scientists do).</p> 
<p>A link to the actual article&hellip;<br>

http://svetlana14s.narod.ru/Simon_Singhs_silenced_paper.html</p> 
<p>To contextualize what Singh wrote and is being sued for&hellip;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You might think that modern chiropractors restrict themselves to 
treating back problems, but in fact they still possess some quite wacky ideas. 
The fundamentalists argue that they can cure anything. And even the more 
moderate chiropractors have ideas above their station. The British Chiropractic 
Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic, 
sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged 
crying, even though there is not a jot of evidence. This organisation is the 
respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes 
bogus treatments.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The libel is around the &ldquo;promotes bogus treatments&rdquo; since it 
implies that the BCA is being intentionally unethical (I have no doubt they are 
but we&rsquo;re talking British libel laws here).</p> 
<p>What he said about chiropractic for back pain (from the same 
article)&hellip;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But what about chiropractic in the context of treating back 
problems? Manipulating the spine can cure some problems, but results are mixed. 
To be fair, conventional approaches, such as physiotherapy, also struggle to 
treat back problems with any consistency. Nevertheless, conventional therapy is 
still preferable because of the serious dangers associated with 
chiropractic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Plonit &ndash; It is true that chiropractors use some of the same 
techniques as physiotherapists but that doesn&rsquo;t actually make 
chiropractic methods (which rely upon the concept of subluxations) effective, 
it just means that chiropractors use non-chiropractic techniques. That said, 
back pain is still somewhat mysterious even to medicine (hence it being a 
fertile ground for woo). Of course, the biggest problem with chiropractors 
isn&rsquo;t that they&rsquo;re ineffective, it&rsquo;s that their neck cracking 
confidence trick can cause strokes.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 24 Feb 2010 at 9:02 am </em> 
<p>Alison &ndash; Well I guess it&rsquo;s easier to quit (or whatever 
happened) than to simply act like a reputable skeptic or ethical SBM blogger. 
I&rsquo;m happy SBM will return to being a source of good science and real 
skeptical thinking. Yay! </p> </li>

<p>Fifi,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;BillyJoe &ndash; Actually, I&rsquo;d rather see Singh&rsquo;s quotes 
in context since he&rsquo;s actually not just making non-evidence based 
assertions and generalizations as you seem to think he is when you see him 
quoted out of context. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he is.</p> 
<p>And that is exactly what I&rsquo;m getting at.<br>
 The bold assertions: 
&ldquo;there is not a jot of evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;bogus treatments&rdquo; 
are fine because they are true and there is evidence to back them up, but if 
you have to stick strictly with what the evidence says, it confines you to 
making statements that run into a long paragraphs of explanations and 
qualifications. At the end, few are still listening and fewer still will get 
the message.</p> 
<p>I think it is legitimate to use both the short, snappy and, for all intents 
and purposes, true three-second grabs AND the long-winded sit-down, 
read-and-concentrate, considered response.</p> </li> 
<li> # Alison Cummins <em>on 24 Feb 2010 at 3:52 pm </em> 
<p>BillyJoe,</p> 
<p>No. </p> 
<p>Unqualified assertions wrt chiropractic&rsquo;s ability to treat childhood 
asthma are correct and justified. Simon Singh made them. This was good writing 
both in the sense of being accurate and in the sense of being clear and easy to 
assimilate.</p> 
<p>Unqualified assertions wrt chiropractic&rsquo;s ability to treat back pain 
are unjustified. Writing about chiropractic and back pain would have to choose 
between being accurate and being easy to digest. Singh chose not to write about 
chiropractic and back pain and therefore did not have to make this choice.</p> 
</li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 24 Feb 2010 at 4:00 pm </em> 
<p>BillyJoe &ndash; I don&rsquo;t find Singh&rsquo;s writing or approach to 
skepticism to be anything like Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s, are you generally familiar 
with his work? And had you read the whole article or were you just familiar 
with the phrase that the libel suit was hung on?</p> </li> 
<li> # BillyJoe <em>on 25 Feb 2010 at 5:37 am </em> 
<p>Alison,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Unqualified assertions wrt chiropractic&rsquo;s ability to treat 
childhood asthma are correct and justified. Simon Singh made them. This was 
good writing both in the sense of being accurate and in the sense of being 
clear and easy to assimilate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yet there is evidence that chiropractic works for asthma. So it is strictly 
unjustified to say &ldquo;there is not a jot&rdquo; of evidence that 
chiropractic can treat asthma. What is true is that &ldquo;given the evidence, 
a reasonable and informed person would have not a jot of belief that 
chiropractic is a remedy for asthma&rdquo;.<br>
 (I borrowed that from Tony 
Lloyd)</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Unqualified assertions wrt chiropractic&rsquo;s ability to treat 
back pain are unjustified. Writing about chiropractic and back pain would have 
to choose between being accurate and being easy to digest. Singh chose not to 
write about chiropractic and back pain and therefore did not have to make this 
choice.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Well, maybe just one small qualifier then: chiropractic, defined as a 
realignment of subluxed vertebra as opposed to a good massage, is useless for 
the treatment of back pain.</p> </li> 
<li> # BillyJoe <em>on 25 Feb 2010 at 5:42 am </em> 
<p>Fifi,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;BillyJoe &ndash; I don&rsquo;t find Singh&rsquo;s writing or 
approach to skepticism to be anything like Dr Tuteur&rsquo;s, are you generally 
familiar with his work? And had you read the whole article or were you just 
familiar with the phrase that the libel suit was hung on?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t comparing Dr. Tuteur to Simon Singh and, yes, I have read 
the whole article.</p> 
<p>Simon Singh uses both techniques.<br>
 In the article he said &ldquo;not a 
jot of evidence&rdquo;<br>
 Elsewhere he has actually evaluated the evidence 
that chiropractic helps asthma and other non spinal conditions.</p> </li> 
<li> # Fifi <em>on 25 Feb 2010 at 8:38 am </em> 
<p>BillyJoe &ndash; The main point is that making unqualified statements 
isn&rsquo;t SBM writing and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing SBM bloggers call out 
both science journalists and CAM promoters for all the time. This isn&rsquo;t 
opinion-based medicine or ideology-based medicine&hellip;.um, isn&rsquo;t that 
the big black hole of endarkenment that we&rsquo;re all trying to prevent 
science and medicine being sucked into? Isn&rsquo;t that what CAM is and 
aren&rsquo;t we all interested in trying to help people understand that science 
is about evidence and dealing with reality and not just about personal opinions 
and cherry picking evidence to promote an emotion-based opinion or ideology? 
For me at least, science is about learning what objective reality really is 
(despite how it may seem) and not just promoting a subjective perception of 
reality. Seeing really isn&rsquo;t believing and common sense is just as often 
misleading as it is accurate (and is subjective at best, highly biased at 
worst). That&rsquo;s why we developed the scientific method and the tools we 
have, to get past the limitations of our own senses and kluge of a brain.</p> 
<p>Sensationalism, being overly simplistic, relying upon &ldquo;common 
sense&rdquo; over actual evidence, making assertions with no context or 
recontextualising something so it appears other than it is and making broad 
generalizations are all the trademarks of tabloid journalism and woo. Blogging 
can be many things, it can be a personal journal, it can be a soapbox to share 
opinions with the world or it can be a very credible extension and form of 
journalism (either editorial or investigative). SBM has established itself as 
being on the journalism spectrum with both editorial and 
investigative/analytical aspects. Because science journalists and media, and 
other researchers, are critiqued here, it&rsquo;s just a matter of basic 
integrity to live up to the standards one sets for others. Otherwise 
you&rsquo;re back to being just like what you&rsquo;re critiquing, which makes 
any soapbox a pretty slippery place to stand when push comes to shove. And, if 
you&rsquo;re going to take on ideologues and true believers, and people with 
commercial interests or a lot to lose if reality is exposed, there is going to 
be pushing and shoving. (And, let&rsquo;s be honest, some of the SBM bloggers 
here aren&rsquo;t above at least poking &ndash; quite deservedly &ndash; some 
of the more ridiculous offenders with a stick&hellip;they generally just make 
sure it&rsquo;s an evidence stick and not just the pointy end of their ego.)</p>
<p>The other thing worth mentioning is that communication plays a key role in 
shaping public perception of both CAM and SBM, which is why I personally think 
it&rsquo;s a big deal not to use CAM/propaganda/advertising methodology which 
isn&rsquo;t about promoting critical or reality-based thinking. If you want to 
educate people about how to critically read media, how to deconstruct an 
argument for themselves and how not to get sucked into sensationalist or bogus 
&ldquo;common sense&rdquo; assertions, you can&rsquo;t use dodgy methods 
yourself and claim they&rsquo;re legitimate or critical thinking when you use 
them but dodgy when others do. It&rsquo;s entirely possible to be entertaining, 
provocative and to explain complex ideas in lay terms without resorting to 
dodgy techniques. A lot of it is about providing context, that&rsquo;s why the 
context of who someone is in terms of their actions becomes relevant (and why 
SBM bloggers bring up things like how someone has spoken at a CAM conference as 
being relevant to their integrity level, or whether they get funding from drug 
companies and how they make a living and so on&hellip;these things are relevant 
in medical science in terms of determining integrity and potential biases).</p>

sometimes wonder if I shouldn&rsquo;t just sell the damn things. I can tell 
people that there isn&rsquo;t a shred of evidence for many of these
