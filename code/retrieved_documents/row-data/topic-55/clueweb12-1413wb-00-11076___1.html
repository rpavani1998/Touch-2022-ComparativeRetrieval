<h2>Chiropractic and Low Back Pain: The Research Evidence</h2> 
<p>X-ray for Chiropractic</p> 
<p>Here are just a few of the studies showing chiropractic care being very 
effective for the treatment of low back pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Waagen, GN, et al. (1986) Short term trial of chiropractic 
adjustments for the relief of chronic low back pain. Manual Medicine, vol. 2, 
pp63-7.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Waagen, GN, et al. (1991) A prospective short and long term 
comparative trial of general medical practice care, chiropractic manipulation 
therapy and sham manipulation in the management of chronic low back pain. 
Abstract.</strong></p> 
<p>This 1986 study was the first randomized, controlled trial of manipulation 
against a placebo sham maneuver. While it was small, with only 19 subjects, it 
was conclusive. The patients receiving chiropractic adjustments showed a 
significant improvement in pain relief and objective measures of spinal 
mobility as compared to the sham group. Thus both subjective and objective 
measures supported chiropractic treatment. Waagen followed this up in 1991 with 
a larger study comparing general medical care with sham manipulations and 
chiropractic care using adjustments. While both the medical and chiropractic 
groups improved in pain and function as compared to the sham group, only the 
chiropractic group improved significantly. These results held at 3 and 24 month 
follow-ups.</p> 
<p><strong>Ongley, MJ, et al. (1987) A new approach to the treatment of low 
back pain. Lancet, Vol. 2, pp 143-6.</strong></p> 
<p>This randomized trial was carried out by MDs looking at low back pain 
treatments. The experimental group received forceful spinal manipulations and 
injections of a proliferant solution to reduce pain. The control group received 
&ldquo;less extensive&rdquo; manipulation and a local anesthesia injection in 
place of the proliferant. Subjects were evaluated for effectiveness of the 
treatment at onset, one, 3 and 6 month intervals using pain and disability 
scales and objective evaluation of physical signs. The experimental group 
(manipulation) showed significantly better improvement in all evaluation modes 
at all three intervals. These MDs concluded manipulation is &ldquo;a safe and 
effective treatment&rdquo;.</p>

randomized comparison of chiropractic and hospital outpatient treatment. 
British Medical Journal, Vol. 300, pp 1431-37.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Meade, TW, et al (1995) Randomized comparison of chiropractic and 
hospital outpatient management for low back pain: results from extended 
follow-up. British Medical Journal, 311:349.</strong></p> 
<p>This was a Medical Research Council study done in England, published in the 
British Medical Journal, looking at low back pain. It was a large (741 
subjects) and meticulous study comparing treatment outcomes at hospital 
outpatient clinics and chiropractic clinics. In this randomized, controlled 
format, treatment outcomes were measured by pain and disability questionnaires, 
straight leg raise and lumbar flexion, and patients were tracked for 2 years.
</p> 
<p>Meade reported that chiropractic care demonstrated significantly better 
long-term benefit that started soon after the onset of care. The medical care 
group showed deterioration after 6 months, even though the medical group had 
more follow-up visits after that stage. Meade also reported that the greatest 
benefit in the chiropractic group was with the chronic and severe low back pain 
patients.</p> 
<p>A longer-term follow-up study by Meade in 1995 addressed some minor 
criticisms and produced the same results and showed longer lasting effects for 
the chiropractic group. It also noted there was significantly less lost time at 
work in the chiropractic group.</p> 
<p><strong>Manga, P et al (1993) The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
chiropractic management of low back pain. Pran Magna and Associates. University 
of Ottawa, Ontario Canada.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Manga, P et al (1998) Enhanced chiropractic coverage under OHIP as 
a means of reducing health care costs, attaining better health outcomes and 
improving the public&rsquo;s access to cost-effective health services. 
University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</strong></p> 
<p>This study was commissioned by the Ontario government to look at the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapy provided for low back pain by 
MDs, chiropractors and physiotherapists. Pran Magna was a health economist at 
the Univeristy of Ottawa who undertook this review of the research evidence and 
government health statistics. His summary points are emphatic: As compared to 
medical and physiotherapy treatment in Ontario, chiropractic care is 
significantly better in,<br>
 1. effectiveness<br>
 2. safety<br>
 3. cost 
effectiveness<br>
 4. patient satisfaction</p> 
<p>He made a strong recommendation for the Ontario government to utilize 
chiropractors in the treatment of low back pain patients. He estimated the 
savings of &ldquo;hundreds of millions&rdquo; of dollars annually if the 
treatment of back pain was transferred from MDs to chiropractors.</p> 
<p>In 1998, Manga published a second study. In his results he comments that,
<br> 1. Musculoskeletal disorders are the greatest cause of pain and disability 
in Ontario.<br>
 2. They are also the second most costly health care problem<br>
 3. Doubling the proportion of patients who visit chiropractors from 10% to 
(only) 20% would save the government $348 million per year in direct costs and 
$1.85 billion in indirect costs.</p> 
<p>(Ironically, after commissioning these studies, six years later, in a 
budget crisis, the Ontario Government dropped chiropractic care from its public 
health insurance program (OHIP) using the savings for increased hip and knee 
surgeries and the construction of more MRI and CT scanners.)</p>

<p><strong>U Ebrall, PS (1992) Mechanical low back pain: a comparison of 
medical and chiropractic management within the Victorian welfare scheme. 
Chiropractic Journal of Australia, 22(2), 47-53.</strong></p> 
<p>These are two of many studies undertaken internally by Workers&rsquo; 
Compensation Boards. Jarvis was in the US, Ebrall in Australia.<br>
 In Utah, 
Jarvis reported patients with back injuries took 10x the number of days off 
work (20.7 vs 2.4) and used 10x the compensation costs ($668 vs $68) when they 
chose medical care vs chiropractic care.</p> 
<p>In Australia Ebrall reported chiropractic claim costs were almost 3/5s 
lower than medical care costs ($963 per claim vs $2308). Medical patients were 
also 10x more likely to develop chronic low back pain (11.6% vs 1.9%).</p> 
<p>Both of these studies, as well as many other worker&rsquo;s compensation 
studies, strongly recommend the utilization of chiropractors in the treatment 
of low back pain claims.</p> 
<p>(In the mid-1990&rsquo;s the Worker&rsquo;s Compensation Board in Ontario 
changed its policy regarding the management of injured workers with low back 
pain to strongly recommend a course of treatment with a practitioner thoroughly 
trained in manipulation.)</p> 
<p><strong>BEAM Trial: United Kingdom back pain and Manipulation (UK BEAM) 
randomized trial: cost-effectiveness of physical treatments for back pain in 
primary care. British Medical Journal Online First, Nov 19, 2004:1-6</strong>
</p> 
<p>This is a large multi-disciplinary trial by the British Medical Research 
Council looking at the effectiveness of physical treatments for back pain 
patients. They looked at general medical care, exercise classes, manipulation 
or a combination of the latter two as the treatments. The trial was a 
randomized, controlled design looking at 1334 subjects.</p> 
<p>The results showed manipulation was a significantly better treatment on all 
measurement scales than general medical care, through the full year of the 
trial. Exercise alone significantly improved only function/disability, and only 
up to the 3 month follow-up. Exercise combined with manipulation showed similar 
results to manipulation alone.</p> 
<p>In a very sophisticated analysis of cost effectiveness the study 
&ldquo;shows consistently that both manipulation alone and manipulation 
followed by exercise provide cost-effective additions to care in general 
practice.&rdquo;</p>

</strong></p> 
<p>In the 1990s governments in the US, UK and Denmark established 
multidisciplinary research agencies to develop guidelines for the treatment of 
back pain. The US and UK led the way in 1994, Denmark followed in 1999. These 
guidelines consistently recommend manipulation by qualified practitioners as an 
essential component in treatment strategies for most patients, essentially the 
chiropractic protocol of care. The traditional medical advice of bed rest and 
surgery is not generally endorsed before conservative care is first applied. 
Generally, the regime is similar in each case:</p> 
<p>&bull; analgesics or anti-inflammatories only briefly<br>
 &bull; advice on 
staying active, and the earliest possible return to normal activities<br>
 
&bull; manipulation<br>
 &bull; back education classes with exercises<br>
 
&bull; patient reassurance<br>
 &bull; focus on the functional as opposed to 
structural cause of the pain<br>
 &bull; consideration of the biopsychosocial 
factors associated with the pain</p> 
<p>The medical associations have been very slow in adopting these guidelines, 
especially in the US where the AMA immediately published their own guidelines 
promoting the traditional protocols of medications and bed rest before a 
surgical consultation.</p>

effectiveness as found in a massive scientific review:</strong></p>

The UK Evidence Report. Chiropractic and Osteopathy 18:3 (25 Feb 2010). Doi: 
10.1186/174601340018-3. Available at www.gcc-uk.org</strong></p> 
<p>After an organized challenge to claims made on British chiropractic 
websites in 2010, a team of the most respected chiropractic researchers were 
commissioned to conduct a literature review of the effectiveness of 
chiropractic treatments, essentially outlining the effective scope of practice 
for chiropractic based on the best available evidence. The researchers looked 
at randomized, controlled trials and &ldquo;16 widely accepted evidence-based 
international clinical guidelines&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The controversy that precipitated this challenge to the profession were the 
claims made by more than half the british chiropractic websites that good 
results could be found in the treatment of colic, eneuresis (bed-wetting), ear 
infections, ADHD, asthma and other childhood afflictions. Here&rsquo;s what the 
researchers found:</p> 
<p>Spinal manipulation is effective in adults for:<br>
 &bull; acute, subacute 
and chronic low back pain<br>
 &bull; migraine and cervicogenic headache<br>
 
&bull; cervicogenic dizziness<br>
 &bull; acute, subacute and chronic neck pain
<br> &bull; several extremity joint conditions</p> 
<p>There is inconclusive but favourable evidence for chiropractic management 
of other musculoskeletal conditions:<br>
 &bull; ankle sprains<br>
 &bull; 
sciatica<br>
 &bull; coccydynia<br>
 &bull; TMJ disorders<br>
 &bull; tension 
headache<br>
 &bull; fibromyalgia<br>
 &bull; etc</p> 
<p>&hellip; and non-musculoskeletal conditions:<br>
 &bull; pre-menstrual 
syndrome<br>
 &bull; pneumonia in older adults<br>
 &bull; nocturnal eneuresis 
in children<br>
 &bull; hypertension<br>
 &bull; otitis media (ear infections) 
in children<br>
 &bull; etc</p> 
<p>Spinal manipulation was not any more effective than sham manipulation for:
<br> &bull; asthma<br>
 &bull; colic/incessant crying in children</p> 
<p>The research supported safety and appropriateness of spinal manipulation 
for all these conditions. Also, &ldquo;that the incidence of serious side 
effects such as a stroke following chiropractic care is extremely rare and is 
probably not related to manipulation in most patients but due to the fact that 
patients develop neck pain or headaches as a result of a dissection of a 
vertebral artery that progresses through the natural history of dissection to 
stroke irrespective of the clinician the patient consults&rdquo;.<br>
 In 
summary, about 90% of chiropractic practice is supported by scientific evidence 
at the most rigorous Randomized Control Trial level. The 10% of unsupported 
practice (not practiced by the majority of chiropractors) hails from the 
fundamentalist, pre-scientific era of chiropractic philosophy.</p> &lt; Common
