<h2>Anodyne&reg; Therapy - <i>Clinically Proven Results</i></h2> 
<p> Anodyne&reg; Therapy is medical device that emits infrared light at a 
wavelength of 890 nm, and can be applied to any area of the body. Anodyne&reg; 
Therapy is indicated by the US FDA to temporarily increase circulation and 
reduce pain, stiffness and muscle spasm. There are over 6,000 US Anodyne&reg; 
Therapy Providers, and by adding Anodyne&reg; Therapy to a plan of care, 
Healthcare Providers are better able to address the source of many types of 
acute and chronic pain, instead of just treating the symptoms. The Anodyne&reg; 
Therapy Systems have been prescribed and used by over 20,000 doctors and 
therapists - who trust its clinical effectiveness.<strong>Clinical applications 
include (but are not limited to) treatment of: acute pain/injuries, chronic 
pain and or poor circulation in the extremities caused by chemotherapy, 
diabetes, vascular diseases, etc, muscle spasm and muscle stiffness.</strong>
</p> 
<h2>The data is compelling.</h2> 
<p> In addition to an extensive amount of published evidence on the effects of 
infrared therapy devices with similar wavelengths (810-940nm), there have been 
13 published peer reviewed studies demonstrating positive effects for 
Anodyne&reg; Therapy Systems specifically!</p> 
<p>Our largest study, involving 2239 patients was published in the Journal of 
Diabetes and Its Complications (2006). This study demonstrated a mean 67% pain 
reduction after a clinical treatment program involving Anodyne&reg; Therapy4.
</p> 
<p>Another study involving 493 patients, examining changes in pain levels of 
lower extremity pain (Diabetic and Non-Diabetic), was published in the journal 
of Practical Pain Management (2007). This study demonstrated a 64% reduction in 
pain. Furthermore, this study reported that 51% of patients studied were able 
to reduce their use of pain medications1.</p> 
<h2>It's effective for pain relief because <i>it works through the local 
release of Nitric Oxide.</i></h2> 
<p><b>Clinical Research has linked Nitric Oxide with:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Increases in local circulation2</li> 
<li>Reduction of pain3</li> 
<li>Reduction in inflammation6</li> 
<li>Angiogenesis9</li> 
<li>Collagen synthesis8</li> </ul> 
<p> Researchers have discovered that near infrared light increases the release 
of nitric oxide (NO) from hemoglobin and myoglobin with resulting positive 
biocellular response5.Nitric oxide has been studied for many years, however, 
interest has peaked in the last 10-15 years as a result of the discovery of 
nitric oxide's role as a signaling mechanism in the human body - with the 
researchers receiving The Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1998.</p> 
<p>In addition to the regulation of the processes noted above, nitric oxide 
plays a very important role in the vascular system and is also known as 'the 
endothelium derived relaxing factor'. When nitric oxide is released it 
stimulates the endothelial lining of both arterial and venous blood vessels, 
causing vasodilation2. In addition, as Ferrieira et al. discuss, nitric oxide 
also plays a direct role in pain relief3.</p> 
<p>Nitric oxide is particularly significant for people with diabetes. In their 
paper 'Nitric Oxide and Diabetic Complications', Traub and Van Bibber note that 
&quot;nitric oxide metabolism and vascular responsiveness to nitric oxide are 
altered in diabetics&quot;, and conclude that, &quot;patients with diabetes may 
benefit from therapeutic agents that target nitric oxide pathways7.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Treatment Information </h2> 
<p>Treatment typically begins with an individual assessment of the patient's 
functional limitations and a plan of care is then designed to help them reach 
their goals. A treatment program typically consists of 10-24 therapy sessions, 
and may include some of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anodyne&reg; Therapy 30 minutes 3x per week</li> 
<li>Stretching and strengthening exercises</li> 
<li>Dynamic and static balance exercises</li> 
<li>Massage and other therapeutic modalities for pain</li> </ul> <br>

<h2>Prescribing Information</h2> 
<p> Anodyne&reg; Therapy is indicated by the US FDA to temporarily increase 
circulation and reduce pain, stiffness and muscle spasm. It has been used 
safely for over 12 years on hundreds of thousands of patients. Anodyne&reg; 
Therapy should not be used directly over an active malignancy or over the womb 
of a pregnant woman. With increased activities during therapy, patients should 
always monitor their blood sugars carefully. There are no known drug 
interactions or side effects, other than a slight risk of a superficial burn if 
therapy protocols and precautions are not followed.</p> 
<p><strong>Will your patients require ongoing treatment?</strong><br>
 
Patients with an acute injury or problem, more than likely, will not require 
ongoing treatments. Since there is no known cure for the conditions that 
contribute to chronic extremity pain or circulatory impairment, these patients
<strong>will </strong>require ongoing treatments. The comprehensive care 
provided by Anodyne&reg; Therapy Providers gives each patient a jump-start 
towards improving their condition. There are two systems available for patient 
home use, the Freedom 300 and the Model 120. With affordable financing options 
offered for both systems, most everyone can afford to continue their treatments 
at home.</p>

<p><strong>How does Anodyne&reg; Therapy work on pain?</strong><br>
 
Anodyne&reg; Therapy works both directly and indirectly to relieve pain, and is 
easily applied wherever you may have pain. For patients with an acute injury or 
condition, Anodyne&reg; Therapy helps to decrease pain, reduce stiffness and 
muscle spasm and increase circulation directly to the affected area of your 
body. Some chronic diseases and conditions can limit blood flow to the tiny 
vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the nerves in your peripherals - 
arms, hands, legs, and feet - resulting in pain. Anodyne&reg; Therapy 
treatments increase circulation by dilating these vessels, which indirectly 
reduces pain caused by lack of blood flow.</p> <br>

<h3>51% of Anodyne Therapy patients reduced or eliminated their use of pain 
medications.5</h3> 
<p> <strong>Will the pain stay away?</strong><br>
 If you have an acute or 
temporary problem, more than likely, you will not require ongoing treatments. 
If you have a chronic condition causing your pain or circulatory problem, 
clinical treatment with Anodyne&reg; Therapy will not be a cure, but rather a 
an ongoing treatment for your condition. Affordable Anodyne&reg; home systems 
are available for continuing pain relief in the privacy and comfort of your 
home.</p> 
<h2>You can join the many thousands of Anodyne&reg;Therapy Patients!</h2> 
<p> &quot;I have been taking Anodyne treatments since March of 2005. I was in 
severe pain at night. After several treatments for 3 months, my pain decreased 
by 80%, and I got some of my life back. I now use my home unit once every 4 
days, and my pain is virtually gone, and I now get a good night sleep. I am now 
back as a volunteer at a local senior center about 30 hours per week.&quot;</p> 
<p>- <em>J.B., Atlanta, GA </em></p> 
<p><em>&quot;</em>Using Anodyne Therapy has been a miracle for me. The pain is 
gone and I am sleeping though the night again. I am no longer using a cane to 
walk and I have started driving again! I feel like I have my life back. Last 
month, I even went on a cruise! I feel blessed to have found Anodyne Therapy, 
and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has chronic pain that is 
affecting their quality of life.&quot;</p> 
<p>- <em>R.F., Seminole, FL</em></p> 
<p><em>&quot;</em>I just want to thank you. My mother has suffered from 
painful legs and feet for years. Nothing we've tried has made a difference 
until now. Since she started Anodyne Therapy, she has been able to completely 
stop the medications she was taking and finally get some sleep at night. It's a 
true miracle.&quot;</p>

<h2>                                            Anodyne&reg; Therapy - <i>What 
to Expect</i></h2> 
<p><strong>What is Anodyne Therapy? </strong><br>
 As part of your plan of 
care, you will be receiving treatment with an exciting technology, called 
Anodyne&reg; Therapy. Anodyne&reg; Therapy is an Infrared Light Therapy device 
that can be applied to any area of the body and is indicated for temporarily 
increasing circulation and reducing pain, stiffness and muscle spasm. 
Healthcare Providers that add Anodyne&reg; Therapy to their treatment programs 
can better address the source of many types of acute and chronic pain, instead 
of just treating the symptoms.</p> 
<p><strong>What might you experience during treatment?</strong><br>
 
Typically, patients will receive treatments with an Anodyne&reg; Therapy System 
in conjunction with a therapy plan of care. It is important not to discontinue 
your treatment plan until you are discharged or have spoken with your 
therapist. There are no known side effects of Anodyne&reg; Therapy, however, 
please be aware of the following points:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Patients normally feel a soothing warmth.</strong> If the Pads 
feel too warm, tell your Anodyne&reg; Provider right away so the intensity can 
be adjusted.</li> 
<li><strong>Your skin in the treatment area may be slightly pink after 
treatment.</strong> This is a sign of increased circulation and should 
disappear within a few hours. If this persists longer than a few hours, notify 
your Anodyne&reg; Provider at your next session.</li> 
<li><strong>You may feel some tingling or minor pain at first.</strong> Again, 
this is a sign of increased circulation. Your Anodyne&reg; Provider can adjust 
their protocol. If these feelings do not go away within a few weeks, talk to 
your Anodyne&reg; Provider.</li> 
<li><strong>If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugars regularly</strong>
, as you are likely beginning a new exercise program. Please note, the use of 
Anodyne&reg; Therapy alone does not cause hypoglycemia.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>You may need a home system to STAY better.</strong><br>
 If you 
experience relief with Anodyne&reg; Therapy, and you have an acute injury or 
problem, more than likely, you will not require ongoing treatments. If you have 
a chronic condition causing your pain or circulatory problem, clinical 
treatment with Anodyne&reg; Therapy will not be a cure, but rather a drug-free 
treatment for your condition.</p> 
<p>Affordable Anodyne&reg; home systems are available for continuing pain 
relief in the privacy and comfort of your home. The purchase of an Anodyne&reg; 
home system is a lifetime investment in your ongoing health and wellness.</p> 
<p>Anodyne&reg; Therapy has helped thousands of people just like you. </p> 
<p> &quot;I am a 73 year old female. I have suffered from foot and leg pain 
since the early 90's. I read about Anodyne Therapy in a newspaper column, and 
checked the website. I received a doctor's prescription for the therapy for 10 
weeks at a local provider. I took two or three treatments a week. After 9 
sessions, I had eye surgery and backed off the treatments. Guess what - the 
Anodyne treatments had worked. I have been pain free for 30 days and off all of 
my medications. I am so thankful to be relieved from all the burning stabbing 
pain.&quot;</p> 
<p>- H. Griffin, Lincoln, NE </p> 
<p>&quot;I heard of Anodyne several years ago. I thought the claims for relief 
were, if not unfounded, certainly exaggerated. I went to the local physical 
therapy facility and had 3 treatments a week for four weeks. The relief was 
dramatic. The Anodyne Machine (Model 120) is a miracle and has made my life 
easy to live again. I use it every day.&quot;</p>
