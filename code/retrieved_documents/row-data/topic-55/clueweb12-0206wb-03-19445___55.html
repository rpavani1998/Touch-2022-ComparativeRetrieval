 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of back 
pain, including sciatica. Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>Statistics:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2006 back pain was 
responsible for 62% of cases of people missing work due to pain involving the 
upper body.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Back pain can be acute, subacute, or chronic. 
<ul> 
<li>Acute back pain develops suddenly and lasts up to several weeks. Acute 
pain is the most common type of back pain.</li> 
<li>Subacute back pain is pain that lasts up to three months.</li> 
<li>Chronic back pain can come on fast or slow, but it lasts longer than 3 
months.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Back pain can occur in any area of the back, but it is more common in the 
lower part, which supports most of the body's weight.</li> 
<li>Because most patients with back pain are on the mend or complete recover 
within 6 weeks, imaging techniques such as x-rays or scans are rarely 
recommended in the first month of pain -- unless a health care provider 
suspects a tumor, fracture, infection, cauda equina syndrome, or progressive 
neurologic disease.</li> 
<li>In about 85% of back pain cases, the origin of the pain is unknown.</li> 
<li>It is important for any person who has chronic low back pain to have an 
exercise program guided by professionals who understand the limitations and 
special needs of back pain and who can address individual health conditions. 
One study indicated that patients who planned their own exercise did worse than 
those in physical therapy or doctor-directed programs.</li> </ul> Back to Top 
<br>  Introduction 
<p>Back pain is one of the most common reasons people visit their doctor. 
According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin 
Diseases, 8 out of 10 people have some type of backache.</p> 
<p>Back pain can be acute, subacute, or chronic.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acute back pain develops suddenly and lasts up to several weeks. Acute 
pain is the most common type of back pain.</li> 
<li>Subacute back pain is pain that lasts up to 3 months.</li> 
<li>Chronic back pain can come on fast or slow, but it lasts longer than 3 
months.</li> </ul> 
<p>Back pain can occur in any area of the back, but it is more common in the 
lower back, which supports most of the body's weight.</p> 
<h3>The Spine</h3> 
<p>The back is highly complex, and pain may result from damage or injury to 
any of its various bones, nerves, muscles, ligaments, and other structures. 
Still, despite sophisticated techniques, which provide detailed anatomical 
images of the spine and other tissues, the cause of most cases of back pain 
remains elusive.</p> 
<p><i>Vertebrae.</i> The spine is a column of small bones, or <i>vertebrae,</i>
 that support the entire upper body. The column is grouped into three sections:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The <i>cervical</i> (C) vertebrae are the seven spinal bones that support 
the neck.</li> 
<li>The <i>thoracic</i> (T) vertebrae are the twelve spinal bones that connect 
to the rib cage.</li> 
<li>The <i>lumbar</i> (L) vertebrae are the five lowest and largest bones of 
the spinal column. Most of the body's weight and stress falls on the lumbar 
vertebrae.</li> </ul> Click the icon to see an image of the spine. <br>
<br>

<br> 
<p>Below the lumbar region is the <i>sacrum</i>, a shield-shaped bony 
structure that connects with the pelvis at the<em>sacroiliac joints</em>.</p> 
<p>At the end of the sacrum are two to four tiny, partially fused vertebrae 
known as the<i>coccyx,</i> or &quot;tail bone.&quot;</p> Click the icon to see 
an image of the sacrum. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Each vertebra is designated by using a letter and number, alllowing the 
doctor to determine where it is in the spine.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The letter reflects the spinal region where thevertebra is located: 
<ul> 
<li>C=cervical (neck region)</li> 
<li>T= thoracic (chest, or middle back, region)</li> 
<li>L=lumbar (lower back)</li> </ul></li> 
<li>The number signifies the vertebra's place within that spinal region. The 
numbers start with 1 at the top of a region and count up as the vertebrae 
descend within the region. For example, C4 is the fourth bone down in the 
cervical region, and T8 is the eighth thoracic vertebrae.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>The Disks.</i> Vertebrae in the spinal column are separated from each 
other by small cushions of cartilage known as<i>intervertebral disks</i>. The 
disks have no blood supply of their own. They rely on nearby blood vessels to 
keep them nourished.</p> Click the icon to see an image of an intervertebral 
disk. <br>
<br>
<br>
Each disk is 80% water and contains two structures. 
<ul> 
<li>Inside each disk is a jelly-like substance called the <i>nucleus pulposus.
</i></li> 
<li>The nucleus pulposus is surrounded by a tough, fibrous ring called the <i>
annulus.</i></li> </ul> Click the icon to see an image of the nucleus pulposus. 
<br> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Processes.</i> Each vertebra in the spine has a number of bony 
projections called processes. The spinous and transverse processes attach to 
the muscles in the back and act like little levers, allowing the spine to twist 
or bend. The particular processes form the joints between the vertebrae 
themselves, meeting together and interlocking at the zygapophysial joints (more 
commonly known as facet, or z-joints).</p> 
<p><i>Spinal Canal.</i> Each vertebra and its processes surround and protect 
an arch-shaped central opening. These arches, aligned to run down the spine, 
form the spinal canal, which encloses the spinal cord.</p> Click the icon to 
see an image of the vertebrae and spinal cord. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><i>Spinal Cord.</i> The spinal cord is the central trunk of nerves that 
connects the brain with the rest of the body. Each nerve root passes from the 
spinal column to other parts of the body through small openings, bounded on one 
side by the disk and on the other by the facets. When the spinal cord reaches 
the lumbar region, it splits into four bundled strands of nerve roots called the
<em>cauda equina</em> (meaning horsetail in Latin).</p> Click the icon to see 
an image of the cauda equina. <br>
<br>
<br>
Back to Top <br>
 Symptoms and 
Causes 
<p>In about 85% of back pain cases, the origin of the pain is unknown, and 
imaging studies usually fail to determine its cause. Disk disease, spinal 
arthritis, and muscle spasms are the most common diagnoses. Other problems can 
also cause back pain, however.</p> 
<h3>Lumbar Degenerative Disk Disease/Spondylosis</h3> 
<p>Osteoarthritis occurs in joints where cartilage is damaged and then 
destroyed, usually as a result of aging. In reaction to this destruction, the 
bones associated with the joints develop abnormalities. When osteoarthritis 
affects the spine, it may damage the cartilage in the disks, the moving joints 
of the spine, or both. These changes are age-related to some degree. However, 
the rate at which these changes develop varies between people, and may be 
accelerated by trauma or excessive wear and tear. The end result of these 
changes is a gradual loss of spinal structure and function, as well as chronic 
pain, muscle spasms, and reduced mobility. Depending on which part and how much 
of the spine is involved, symptoms may be similar to that of a herniated disc, 
lumbar strain, or spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal).</p> 
<h3>Herniated Disk</h3> 
<p>A herniated disk, sometimes (incorrectly) called a slipped disk, is a 
common cause of severe back pain and sciatica. A disk in the lumbar area 
becomes herniated when it ruptures or thins out, and degenerates to the point 
that the gel within the disk (the nucleus pulposus) pushes outward. The damaged 
disk can take on many forms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A bulge -- The gel has been pushed out slightly from the disk and is 
evenly distributed around the circumference.</li> 
<li>Protrusion -- The gel has pushed out slightly and asymmetrically in 
different places.</li> 
<li>Extrusion -- The gel balloons extensively into the area outside the 
vertebrae or breaks off from the disk.</li> </ul> 
<p>Leg pain may be worse than the back pain in cases of herniated disks. There 
is also some debate about how pain develops from a herniated disk and how 
frequently it causes low back pain. Many people have disks that bulge or 
protrude and do not suffer back pain. Extrusion (which is less common than the 
other two conditions) is highly associated with back pain, since the gel is 
likely to extend out far enough to press against the nerve root, most often the 
sciatic nerve. Extrusion is very uncommon, however, while sciatic and low-back 
pain are very common. But there may be other causes of low back pain.</p> 
<p><i>Abnormalities in the Annular Ring.</i> Research has also focused on 
tears in the annular ring -- the fibrous band that surrounds and protects the 
disk. The annular ring contains a dense nerve network and high levels of 
peptides that heighten perception of pain. Tears in the annular ring are a 
frequent finding in patients with degenerative disk disease. Some cases of 
chronic low back pain may be caused by inward growth of nerve fibers into the 
annular ring, which triggers pain within the intervertebral disk.</p> 
<p><em>Cauda equina syndrome.</em> Cauda equina syndrome is the impingement of 
the cauda equina (the four strands of nerves leading through the lowest part of 
the spine). The cause is usually massive extrusion of the disk material. Cauda 
equina syndrome is an emergency condition that can cause severe complications 
to bowel or bladder function. It can cause permanent incontinence if not 
promptly treated with surgery. Symptoms of the cauda equina syndrome include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dull back pain</li> 
<li>Weakness or numbness in the buttocks, in the area between the legs, or in 
the inner thigh, backs of legs, or feet; may cause stumbling or difficulty in 
standing</li> 
<li>An inability to control urination and defecation</li> 
<li>Pain accompanied by fever (can indicate an infection)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Sciatica</h3> 
<p><i>The Sciatic Nerve.</i> The sciatic nerve has an extensive pathway.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It first branches from the nerve roots that travel down from the lowest 
part of the spinal cord (in the lumbar and sacral areas). Each of the two 
branches of the sciatic nerve is about as wide as a thumb.</li> 
<li>Each branch of the nerve threads through the pelvis and deep into either 
side of the buttocks.</li> 
<li>The nerve branches, then passes down each hip and along the back of each 
thigh to the foot.</li> </ul> 
<p>Sciatica is not a diagnosis but a description of symptoms that include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Leg pain</li> 
<li>Possible numbness or tingling in the buttock and down the back of the leg
</li> 
<li>Possible weakness of the leg muscles</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Causes of Sciatica.</i> A herniated disk pressing on the sciatic nerve 
is the most common cause of sciatica, although spinal stenosis, degenerative 
disc disease, spondylolisthesis, or other abnormalities of vertebrae that press 
on the sciatic nerve can also cause pain.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><em>Symptoms of Sciatica.</em> Pain due to sciatica can vary widely. It may 
feel like a mild tingling, dull ache, or a burning sensation. In some cases, 
the pain is severe enough to cause immobility.</p> 
<p>The pain most often occurs on one side. Some people have sharp pain in one 
part of the leg or hip and numbness in other parts. The affected leg may feel 
weak.</p> 
<p>The pain often starts slowly. Sciatica pain may get worse:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>At night</li> 
<li>After standing or sitting for long periods of time</li> 
<li>When sneezing, coughing, or laughing</li> 
<li>After bending backwards or walking more than 50 - 100 yards (particularly 
if it is caused by spinal stenosis)</li> </ul> 
<p>Sciatica pain usually goes away within 6 weeks, unless there are serious 
underlying conditions. Pain that lasts longer than 30 days, or gets worse with 
sitting, coughing, sneezing, or straining may indicated a longer recovery.</p> 
<h3>Muscle and Ligament Injuries/Lumbar Strain</h3> 
<p>Strain and injury to the muscles and ligaments supporting the back are the 
major causes of low back pain. The pain is typically more spread out in the 
muscles next to the spine, and may be associated with spasms in those muscles. 
The pain may move to the buttocks but rarely any farther down the leg.</p> 
<p>Some cases of sciatica pain may occur when a muscle located deep in the 
buttocks pinches the sciatic nerve. This muscle is called the piriformis. The 
resulting condition is called piriformis syndrome. Piriformis syndrome usually 
develops after an injury. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose.</p> 
<h3>Spinal Stenosis</h3> 
<p>Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal, or narrowing of the 
nerve root canals where spinal nerves leave the spinal column. This condition 
typically develops as a person ages and the disks become drier and start to 
shrink. At the same time, the bones and ligaments of the spine swell or grow 
larger due to arthritis and chronic inflammation. However, other problems, 
including infection and birth defects, can sometimes cause spinal stenosis.</p> 
<p>Most patients will report the presence of gradually worsening history of 
back pain over time. For others, there may be minimal history of back pain, but 
at some point in this process any disruption, such as a minor injury that 
results in disk inflammation, can cause impingement on the nerve root and 
trigger pain.</p> 
<p>Patients may experience pain or numbness, which can occur in both legs, or 
on just one side. Other symptoms include a feeling of weakness or heaviness in 
the buttocks or legs. Symptoms are usually present or will worsen only when the 
person is standing or walking upright. Often the symptoms will ease or 
disappear when sitting down or leaning forward. These positions may create more 
space in the spinal canal, thus relieving pressure on the spinal cord or the 
spinal nerves. Patients with spinal stenosis are not usually able to walk for 
long periods of time. They may be able to ride an exercise bike.</p> 
<h3>Spondylolisthesis</h3> 
<p>Spondylolisthesis occurs when one of the lumbar vertebrae slips over 
another, or over the sacrum.</p> 
<p>In children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the 
lower back (lumbar vertebra) and the first bone in the sacrum area. It is often 
due to a birth defect in that area of the spine. In adults, the most common 
cause is degenerative disease (such as arthritis). The slip usually occurs 
between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. It is more common in adults over 
65 and women.</p> 
<p>Other causes of spondylolisthesis include stress fractures (commonly seen 
in gymnasts) and traumatic fractures. Spondylolisthesis may occasionally be 
associated with bone diseases.</p> 
<p>Spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. It can produce increased 
lordosis (swayback), but in later stages may result in kyphosis (roundback) as 
the upper spine falls off the lower spine.</p> 
<p>Symptoms may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lower back pain</li> 
<li>Pain in the thighs and buttocks</li> 
<li>Stiffness</li> 
<li>Muscle tightness</li> 
<li>Tenderness in the slipped area</li> </ul> 
<p>Pain generally occurs with activity and is better with rest. Neurological 
damage (leg weakness or changes in sensation) may result from pressure on nerve 
roots, and may cause pain radiating down the legs.</p> 
<h3>Inflammatory Conditions and Arthritis</h3> 
<p>Inflammatory disorders and arthritis syndromes can produce inflammation in 
the spine.</p> 
<p><em>Ankylosing spondylitis</em> is a chronic inflammation of the spine that 
may gradually result in a fusion of vertebrae. Symptoms include a slow 
development of back discomfort, with pain lasting for more than 3 months. The 
back is usually stiff in the morning; pain improves with exercise. In severe 
cases, the patient must continually stoop over. It can be quite mild, however, 
and it rarely affects a person's ability to work. It occurs mostly in young 
Caucasians in their mid-20s. The disease is more common in men, but about 30% 
of the cases are in women. Researchers believe that in most cases the cause is 
hereditary.</p> 
<p>About 20% of people with inflammatory bowel disease and about 20% of people 
with psoriasis develop a similar form of arthritis involving the spine. There 
are multiple treatments for this potentially disabling disease, including 
various immune suppressant medications. Etanercept (Enbrel) and infliximab 
(Remicade), anti-inflammatory agents known as TNF-blockers, are proving to be 
beneficial.</p> 
<h3>Osteoporosis and Compression Fractures</h3> 
<p>Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeleton in which the amount of calcium 
present in the bones slowly decreases to the point where the bones become 
fragile and prone to fractures. It usually does not cause pain unless the 
vertebrae collapse suddenly, in which case the pain is often severe. More than 
one vertebra may be affected.</p> 
<p>In a compression fracture of the vertebrae, the bone tissue of the vertebra 
collapses. More than one vertebra may collapse as a result. When the fracture 
is the result of osteoporosis, the vertebrae in the thoracic (chest) and lower 
spine are usually affected, and symptoms may be worse with walking.</p> 
<p>With multiple fractures, kyphosis (a forward hump-like curvature of the 
spine) may result. In addition, compression fractures are often responsible for 
loss of height. Pressure on the spinal cord may also occur, producing symptoms 
of numbness, tingling, or weakness. Symptoms depend upon the area of the back 
that is affected; however, most fractures are stable and do not produce 
neurological symptoms. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth Report #18</em>: 
Osteoporosis.]</p> 
<h3>Emergent Causes of Back Pain</h3> 
<p>Several serious conditions can also cause back pain. Often, these symptoms 
develop over a short period of time, become more severe, and may have other 
findings that go along with them. Some of these conditions include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) or the disk (diskitis)</li> 
<li>Cancer that has spread to the spine from another part of the body (most 
commonly lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer)</li> 
<li>Cancer that begins in the bones (the most common diagnosis in adults is 
probably multiple myeloma, seen in middle age or older adults); benign tumors 
such as osteoblastoma or neurofibroma and cancers, including leukemia, can also 
cause back pain in children</li> 
<li>Trauma</li> </ul> 
<h3>Miscellaneous Abnormalities and Diagnoses</h3> 
<p>Any abnormality in joints, vertebrae, or nerve roots can cause back pain, 
including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fibromyalgia.</li> 
<li>Other medical conditions that cause referred back pain, occuring in 
conjunction with problems in organs unrelated to the spine (although usually 
located near it); such conditions include ulcers, kidney disease (including 
kidney stones), ovarian cysts, and pancreatitis.</li> 
<li>Chronic uterine or pelvic infections can cause low back pain in women.</li>
<li>The facet joints (z-joints) can wear down; in such cases, pain occurs on 
arching the back or when walking.</li> 
<li>In some cases a segment (consisting of two vertebrae and their common 
joint and disk) becomes unstable when its parts wear down.</li> 
<li>Injury to nerve roots, notably deep root ganglia (nerve cells in the spine 
whose fibers extend from skin to muscle tissue), may be important in some 
cases; some patients may have scar tissue that traps the nerve roots in the 
lower spine and causes sciatica.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>In most known cases, pain begins with an injury, after lifting a heavy 
object, or after making a sudden movement. Not all people have back pain after 
such injuries, however. In the majority of back pain cases, the causes are 
unknown.</p> 
<h3>Aging</h3> 
<p>Intervertebral disks begin deteriorating and growing thinner by age 30. 
One-third of adults over 20 show signs of herniated disks (although only 3% of 
these disks cause symptoms). As people continue to age and the disks lose 
moisture and shrink, the risk for spinal stenosis increases. The incidence of 
low back pain and sciatica increases in women at the time of menopause as they 
lose bone density. In older adults, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are also 
common. However, the risk for low back pain does not mount steadily with 
increasing age, which suggests that at a certain point, the conditions causing 
low back pain plateau.</p> 
<h3>High-Risk Occupations</h3> 
<p>Jobs that involve lifting, bending, and twisting into awkward positions, as 
well as those that cause whole-body vibration (such as long-distance truck 
driving), place workers at particular risk for low back pain. The longer a 
person continues such work, the higher their risk. Some workers wear back 
support belts, but evidence strongly suggests that they are useful only for 
people who currently have low back pain. The belts offer little added support 
for the back and do not prevent back injuries.</p> 
<p>A number of companies are developing programs to protect against back 
injuries. However, studies have been mixed on the outcome of company 
interventions. Employers and workers should make every effort to create a safe 
working environment. Office workers should have chairs, desks, and equipment 
that support the back or help maintain good posture.</p> 
<p>Low back pain accounts for significant losses in workdays and dollars. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, back pain was responsible for 62% 
of cases of people missing work due to pain involving the upper body. A 2004 
study analyzed health care expenses in the United States. The analysis found 
back pain cost over $90 billion, of which $26 billion was spent directly on 
treating the back pain. According to the study, the amount of money spent on 
health care by people with back pain was 1.6 times higher than the health care 
expenses of people without back pain.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Medical Conditions in Children</h3> 
<p>Persistent low back pain in children is more likely to have a serious cause 
that requires treatment than back pain in adults.</p> 
<p><em>Stress fractures (spondylolysis)</em> in the spine are a common cause 
of back pain in young athletes. Sometimes a fracture may not show up for a week 
or two after an injury. Spondylolysis can cause spondylolisthesis, a condition 
in which the spine becomes unstable and the vertebrae slip over each other.</p> 
<p><em>Hyperlordosis</em> is an inborn exaggerated inward curve in the lumbar 
area. Scoliosis, an abnormal curvature of the spine in children, does not 
usually cause back pain.</p> 
<p><em>Juvenile chronic arthropathy</em> is an inherited form of arthritis. It 
can cause pain in the sacrum and hip joints of children and young people. It 
used to be grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but is now defined as a 
separate problem.</p> 
<p>Injuries can also cause back pain in children.</p> 
<h3>Pregnancy</h3> 
<p>Pregnant women are prone to back pain due to a shifting of abdominal 
organs, the forward redistribution of body weight, and the loosening of 
ligaments in the pelvic area as the body prepares for delivery. Tall women are 
at higher risk than short women. Although some earlier research had suggested 
that the use of epidurals for pain relief during labor could lead to chronic 
back pain, studies in 2002 reported no increased risk.</p> 
<h3>Psychological and Social Factors</h3> 
<p>Psychological factors are known to play a strong influential role in three 
phases of low back pain:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Some evidence suggests preexisting depression and the inability to cope 
may be more likely to predict the onset of pain than physical problems. A 
&quot;passive&quot; coping style (not wanting to confront problems) was 
strongly associated with the risk of developing disabling neck or low back pain.
</li> 
<li>Social and psychological factors, as well as job satisfaction, all play a 
role in the severity of a person's perception of back pain. For example, one 
study compared truck drivers and bus drivers. Nearly all the truck drivers 
liked their work. Half of them reported low back pain but only 24% lost time at 
work. Bus drivers, on the other hand, reported much lower job satisfaction than 
truck drivers, and these workers with back pain had a significantly higher 
absentee rate than truck drivers in spite of less stress on their backs. 
Similarly, another study found that pilots, who generally reported &quot;loving 
their jobs,&quot; reported far fewer back problems than their flight crews. And 
yet another study reported that low rank, low social support, and high stress 
in soldiers was associated with a higher risk for disabling back pain.</li> 
<li>Depression and a tendency to develop physical complaints in response to 
stress also increase the likelihood that acute back pain will become a chronic 
condition. The way a patient perceives and copes with pain at the beginning of 
an acute attack may actually condition the patient to either recover or develop 
a chronic condition. Those who over-respond to pain and fear for their 
long-term outlook tend to feel out of control and become discouraged, 
increasing their risk for long-term problems.</li> </ul> 
<p>Studies also suggest that patients who reported prolonged emotional 
distress have less favorable outcomes after back surgeries. It should be 
strongly noted that the presence of psychological factors in no way diminishes 
the reality of the pain and its disabling effects. Recognizing this presence as 
a strong player in many cases of low back pain, however, can help determine the 
full range of treatment options.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>Although most episodes of new back pain, as well as exacerbations of 
chronic back pain, clear up or return to a previous level of discomfort, a 
medical history and a brief physical examination is always necessary. Depending 
on the severity of the symptoms, how long they have been present, and any 
associated medical problems, history and physical exam alone may or may not be 
sufficient.</p> 
<p>The goal is to classify patients into one of three categories</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nonspecific back pain (back pain that is not due to a specific condition 
or abnormality of the spine)</li> 
<li>Back pain associated with nerve roots problems or spinal stenosis</li> 
<li>Back pain associated with another specific cause, which may or may not be 
of a serious nature</li> </ul> 
<p>A medical history and physical examination can usually clarify the 
classification.</p> 
<h3>Medical History</h3> 
<p>The patient should be able to describe the back pain and its history in the 
following manner:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Frequency, duration, and nature of the pain</li> 
<li>When the pain occurs</li> 
<li>What triggered the pain (such as lifting a heavy object)</li> 
<li>Conditions that make the pain worse, such as coughing</li> 
<li>Other relevant symptoms, such as morning stiffness, weakness, or numbness 
in the legs</li> 
<li>Previous episodes of back pain</li> 
<li>Severity of the pain and how it affects the person's ability to perform 
everyday activities or work activities</li> 
<li>Any situation that relieves the pain</li> 
<li>Any history of injuries or accidents involving the neck, back, or hips</li>
<li>Other medical conditions, such as arthritis or osteoporosis</li> </ul> 
<p>A patient should report any serious health problems, symptoms, and concerns 
that may raise a red flag for a more serious condition. These include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>HIV infection or AIDS</li> 
<li>Pain that is persistently increasing in intensity and cannot be relieved
</li> 
<li>Fever that is associated with the back pain</li> 
<li>Any new or worsening neurological symptoms, such as weakness in a specific 
part of the legs or feet</li> 
<li>History of cancer, or currently being treated for cancer</li> 
<li>Problems emptying the bowels or bladder, including incontinence</li> 
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li> </ul> 
<h3>Physical Examination</h3> 
<p>The main goal of a physical exam is to try and determine the source of the 
pain and the limits of movement.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients are asked to sit, stand, and walk in different ways (flat-footed, 
on the toes, and on their heels).</li> 
<li>In some cases they are asked to walk on a treadmill to test for weakness 
in toe or heel walking (which may indicate stenosis).</li> 
<li>Patients will be requested to bend forward, backward, and sideways and to 
twist.</li> 
<li>Patients will be asked to lift their leg straight up while lying down. The 
health care provider will also move the patient's legs in different positions 
and bend and straighten the knees. (Pain caused by sciatica can be intensified 
by lifting the affected leg straight in the air. It is usually sharp, 
localized, and accompanied by numbness or tingling. Pain caused by inflammation 
is duller and more generalized and not affected by lifting a straight leg.)</li>
<li>The health care provider may measure the circumference of the calves and 
thighs to look for muscle deterioration.</li> 
<li>To test nerve function and reflexes, the health care provider will tap the 
knees and ankles with a rubber hammer. The health care provider may also touch 
parts of the body lightly with a pin, cotton swab, or feather to test for 
numbness and nerve sensitivity.</li> 
<li>The health care provider will assess strength in different muscle groups 
of the legs.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Imaging Techniques</h3> 
<p>Imaging tests used to evaluate back pain range from a simple x-ray to a CT 
scan or MRI of the spine. Depending on medical diagnoses that are identified by 
the history, the patient may need such tests as a Dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan for osteoporosis or a nuclear scan for suspected 
arthritis, cancer, or infection.</p> 
<p>Because most patients with back pain are on the mend or completely 
recovered within 6 weeks, imaging techniques such as x-rays or scans are rarely 
recommended in the first month unless the health care provider suspects a 
tumor, fracture, infection, cauda equina syndrome, or progressive neurological 
disease.</p> 
<p>Even when symptoms last longer, unless a potentially serious diagnosis is 
suspected, MRI or CT scans can often be delayed until the time when surgery or 
epidural steroid injections come into consideration as treatment options.</p> 
<p><i>X-Rays.</i> Many patients with acute and uncomplicated low back pain 
believe that plain x-rays of the spinal column are important in a diagnosis. 
However, they are not very helpful in most patients with nonspecific back pain.
</p> 
<p>Patients who have the following symptoms or experience certain events may 
need more sophisticated imaging studies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Significant pain that lasts more than 1 - 2 months</li> 
<li>Symptoms such as pain, numbness, or tingling extending from the buttocks 
down the leg that are very severe or get worse</li> 
<li>Muscle weakness that is significant, persistent, or getting worse</li> 
<li>A previous accident or injury that might have affected the disks or 
vertebra</li> 
<li>A history of cancer</li> 
<li>Indications of an underlying disease such as fever or unexplained weight 
loss</li> 
<li>Pain that occurs in patients over 65 years of age</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</i>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
can provide very well-defined images of soft tissue and bone. It is not 
painful, but some people may feel claustrophobic in scanners that are fully 
enclosed. MRIs can detect annular tears, or disk fragments, and non-spinal 
causes of back pain, including infection and cancer. Some medical evidence 
suggests that relying on MRI images of disk abnormalities to determine 
treatment has resulted in many unnecessary surgeries. At least 40% of<i>all</i> 
adults have bulging or protruding vertebral disks, and most have no back pain. 
The degree of disk abnormalities revealed by MRIs often have very little to do 
with the severity of the pain or the need for surgery. Disk abnormalities in 
people who have back pain may simply be a coincidence rather than an indication 
for treatment.</p> Click the icon to see an image of a MRI machine. <br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Bone Scintigraphy and SPECT Imaging.</i> In rare cases, doctors may use 
bone scintigraphy (bone scanning) to determine abnormalities in the bones. The 
technique may be useful for early detection of spinal fractures, cancer that 
has spread to the bone, or certain inflammatory arthritic conditions. During 
this exam, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein. It 
circulates through the body, and is absorbed by the bones. The bones can then 
be seen using x-rays or<em>single photon emission computed tomography</em> 
(SPECT).</p> 
<p>An <em>x-ray myelogram</em> is an x-ray of the spine that requires a spinal 
injection of a special dye and the need to lie still for several hours to avoid 
a very painful headache. It has value only for select patients with pain on 
moving and standing. It has largely been replaced by CT and MRI scans.</p> 
<h3>Electrodiagnostic Tests</h3> 
<p>Tests that analyze the electric waveforms of nerves and muscles may be 
useful for detecting nerve abnormalities that may be causing back pain, and 
identifying possible injuries. They are also useful to determine if any 
abnormal structural findings on an MRI or other imaging tests have real 
significance as a cause of back pain. It should be noted that any nerve 
injuries that affect these tests may not be present for 2 - 4 weeks after 
symptoms begin.</p> 
<p>Nerve conduction studies and electromyography are the electrodiagnostic 
tests most commonly performed. These tests are not used often in the evaluation 
and management of patients with low back pain.</p> 
<h3>Other Tests</h3> 
<p><em>Diskography</em> is an x-ray of the disk. Since many people have 
evidence of disk degeneration on their MRI scans, it is not always easy to tell 
if the finding on this MRI scan explains pain the patient may be experiencing. 
Diskography is a test that is used to help determine whether an abnormal disk 
seen on MRI explains someone's pain. When performed, it is generally reserved 
for patients who did not experience relief from other therapies, including 
surgery. This procedure requires injections into disks suspected of being the 
source of pain and disks nearby. It can be painful. There is controversy among 
physicians who take care of the spine regarding the usefulness of diskography 
for making decisions about care, particularly surgery</p> 
<p>Blood and urine samples may be used to test for infections, arthritis, or 
other conditions.</p> 
<p>Injecting a drug that blocks pain into the nerves in the back helps locate 
the level in the spine where problems occur.</p> 
<p>A procedure called a facet block is also useful in locating areas of 
specific damage.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Medications 
<p>The most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of back pain are 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs block 
prostaglandins, the substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation 
and pain. Evidence suggests that short-term use of NSAIDs brings effective 
relief in patients with acute back pain. The benefits for chronic back pain are 
less certain.</p> 
<p>There are dozens of NSAIDs. The most common are the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Over-the-counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin 
IB, Rufen), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT).</li> 
<li>Prescription NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, 
Anaprox), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), diclofenac (Voltaren), tolmetin (Tolectin), 
ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail), nabumetone (Relafen), dexibuprofen (Seractil), 
and indomethacin (Indocin).</li> 
<li>Topical NSAIDs delivered in gels, creams, or patches do not appear to 
provide any long-term benefits in reducing arthritic pain.</li> </ul> 
<p>Many experts now recommend that patients who take NSAIDs by mouth only do 
so for a short period of time. A 2004 review published in the<em>British 
Medical Journal</em> suggested that long-term use of NSAIDs does not actually 
reduce osteoarthritis pain and may increase patients' risk of experiencing side 
effects. High dosages of NSAIDs can cause heart problems such as increased 
blood pressure, kidney problems, and stomach bleeding.</p> 
<p>In April 2005, the FDA asked drug manufacturers of prescription NSAIDs to 
place an alert on their medicines warning people that the drugs have been 
linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal 
bleeding. The FDA also requested manufacturers of OTC NSAIDs to revise their 
labels to include more specific language concerning potential cardiovascular 
and gastrointestinal risks. Aspirin does not contain such warning labels.</p> 
<h3>NSAID-Induced Ulcers and Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h3> 
<p>Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the 
second most common cause of ulcers and the rate of NSAID-caused ulcers is 
increasing. Ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are 
also more likely to bleed than those caused by the bacterium<em>H. pylori</em>.
</p> 
<p>Doctors cannot predict which patients taking these drugs will develop 
bleeding.</p> 
<p>Among the groups at high risk for bleeding are elderly people, anyone with 
a history of ulcers of GI bleeding, patients with serious heart conditions, 
alcohol abusers, and those on certain medications, such anticoagulants 
(&quot;blood thinners&quot;), corticosteroids, or bisphosphonates (drugs used 
for osteoporosis).</p> 
<p>Proton-pump inhibitors may help to prevent and heal ulcers caused by 
NSAIDs. Proton-pump inhibitors include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole 
(Nexium), and lansoprazole (Prevacid).</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>COX-2 Inhibitors (Coxibs)</h3> 
<p>Coxibs block an inflammation-promoting enzyme called COX-2. This drug class 
was initially thought to work as well as NSAIDs, while causing less 
gastrointestinal distress. However, following numerous reports of 
cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal problems, and skin rashes, the FDA is 
currently re-evaluating the relative risks and benefits of this drug class. 
Rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib (Bextra) have been withdrawn from the United 
States market. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is still available, but patients should ask 
their doctor if this drug is appropriate and safe for them.</p> 
<h3>Tramadol</h3> 
<p>Tramadol (Ultram) is a pain reliever that has been used as an alternative 
to opioids. It has opioid-like properties, but is not as addictive. (Dependence 
and abuse have been reported, however.) It can cause nausea, but does not cause 
the severe gastrointestinal problems that NSAIDs can. Some patients who take 
tramadol experience severe itching. A combination of tramadol and acetaminophen 
(Ultracet) is now available. It provides more rapid pain relief than tramadol 
alone.</p> 
<h3>Opioid Pain Relievers</h3> 
<p>Narcotics are pain-relieving and sleep-inducing drugs that act on the 
central nervous system. They are the most powerful medications available for 
the management of pain.</p> 
<p>There are two types of narcotics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Opiates</i> are derived from natural opium such as morphine and 
codeine.</li> 
<li> <i>Opioids</i> are synthetic drugs and include oxycodone (Percodan, 
Percocet, Oxycontin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and oxymorphone (Numorphan).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Novel ways to deliver pain medicine have been developed. A skin patch 
containing an opioid called transdermal fentanyl (Duragesic) may relieve 
chronic back pain more effectively than oral opioids. For very severe pain, a 
small, patient-controlled pump called SynchroMed may be used. This device is 
implanted under the skin in the abdomen and delivers pulses of pain-relieving 
opioids to the spinal canal.</p> 
<p>Common side effects of opioids include anxiety, constipation, nausea and 
vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, paranoia, urinary retention, restlessness, and 
labored or slow breathing. Addiction is a risk, although less than is commonly 
believed when these medications are used for pain relief. In fact, when 
prescribed properly, use of opioids for chronic pain can be safer in some cases 
than on-going use of NSAIDs. Unfortunately, opioid abuse among young people is 
a major concern. Unless the pain is very severe, experts advise against 
routinely prescribing opioids.</p> 
<h3>Injections</h3> 
<p>Injections of different substances are sometimes used to treat low back 
pain caused by nerve impingement. The injection is usually an epidural, which 
is directed into the spaces between the outer membrane of the spine and the 
vertebrae. None of these substances cure the problem.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Corticosteroids. An injection of a corticosteroid (commonly called a 
steroid) is directed as close to the injured location as possible. 
Corticosteroids reduce inflammation. This approach may temporarily relieve 
sciatic pain until the body heals itself. Studies that measure the benefits of 
steroids on sciatica or low back pain are conflicting. There is some evidence 
that patients can experience rebound pain within a few months. Some experts 
have also raised concerns that even a single injection can cause serious and 
painful side effects, including meningitis and inflammation, although such 
risks are very low.</li> 
<li>Hypertonic saline (salt water solution). Epidural injections of saline are 
being investigated for breaking up scar tissue. One 2001 study compared 
targeted injections of saline and steroids directed at the nerve root. Although 
steroid injections had more immediate benefits, both products offered 
improvement. By the third month, patients who had saline injections experienced 
less pain than the steroid group. A 2003 study found that epidural 
corticosteroid injections provided no greater benefit than saline injections 
for patients with sciatica.</li> 
<li>Local anesthetics. Injections of anesthetics such as Xylocaine or 
bupivacaine may help some patients, although studies on their benefits are 
mixed.</li> 
<li>Botulinum. Researchers are investigating whether injections of botulinum 
toxin (Botox) in the lower back can safely and effectively relieve pain. Very 
small amounts of Botox temporarily paralyzes muscle tissue. Botox is commonly 
used to smooth out wrinkles. Some studies have suggested that Botox may be very 
helpful in relieving chronic low back pain and sciatica caused by piriformis 
syndrome. In a 2001 study, the benefits of Botox injections for low back pain 
subsided within 6 months.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Antidepressants</h3> 
<p>A 2002 review of studies concluded that antidepressants may lessen pain 
severity in some patients, although they had little effect on daily 
functioning. Antidepressants called tricyclics can be effective painkillers in
<i>non-depressed</i> people with chronic back pain. Such antidepressants 
include amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin 
(Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), amoxapine (Asendin), nortriptyline (Pamelor, 
Aventyl), and maprotiline (Ludiomil). It should be noted that tricyclics can 
have severe side effects. Nonetheless, experts believe there is a useful role 
for these drugs that warrants further investigation.</p> 
<h3>Muscle Relaxants</h3> 
<p>A combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle 
relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), diazepam (Valium), carisoprodol 
(Soma), or methocarbamol (Robaxin) are sometimes used for patients with acute 
low back pain. Medical evidence has found that they can help relieve 
non-specific low back pain, but some experts have warned that these drugs 
should be used cautiously, since they target the brain, not the muscles. 
Patients who take muscle relaxants may experience a number of central nervous 
system side effects such as drowsiness. The muscle relaxant Soma can be 
addictive and does little more than produce sleep.</p> 
<h3>Investigative Agents</h3> 
<p> <i>Tumor-Necrosis Factor (TNF) Modifiers.</i> TNF modifiers block the 
action of tumor necrosis factor, a protein involved in inflammatory response. 
Because of their anti-inflammatory properties, TNF modifier drugs are being 
investigated for the treatment of the nerve dysfunction and pain that occurs in 
sciatica. Some small studies indicate that infliximab (Remicade) may help 
reduce sciatica pain. Early studies suggest that another TNF modifier, 
etanercept (Enbrel), may be useful for treating sciatica and back pain. TNF 
modifiers are powerful drugs that can cause severe side effects.</p> 
<p> <i>Lidocaine Patch.</i> A skin patch containing lidocaine, a local 
anesthetic, has been used specifically for herpes zoster pain. Early studies 
suggest that this patch, called Lidoderm, may provide significant relief for 
people who suffer from low back pain with very few adverse effects, even with 
continuous use of four patches a day. If further studies support its benefits, 
the patch could prove to be an important treatment</p> 
<p> <i>NO-NSAIDs.</i> NO-NSAIDs are drugs that combine NSAIDs and nitric oxide 
(NO), a substance that enhances blood flow to the stomach and increases levels 
of protective mucus and bicarbonate. These agents show particular promise in 
providing pain relief and reducing the risk for GI problems.</p> 
<h3>Herbs and Supplements</h3> 
<p>Generally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not 
need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and 
supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential 
to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a number of 
reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. 
Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary 
supplements.</p> 
<p>Most herbal remedies used for back pain have both pain-relief and 
anti-inflammatory effects. Popular herbs for back pain relief include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>White willow bark (<em>Salix alba</em>) contains salicylates, the same 
chemicals found in aspirin.</li> 
<li>Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple.</li> 
<li>Boswellia (<em>Boswellia serrata</em>) is an herb commonly used in Indian 
Ayurvedic medicine.</li> 
<li>Devil's claw (<em>Harpagophytum procumbens</em>) is an African herb 
sometimes used to relieve arthritic pain.</li> </ul> 
<p>White willow bark, bromelain, and Boswellia have blood-thinning properties 
and can interfere with anticoagulant medications such as warfarin (Coumadin).
</p> Back to Top <br>
 Complementary and Alternative Medicine  A number of 
complementary and alternative treatments are used to relieve back pain. 
Complementary means it is used together with conventional medicine. Alternative 
means it is done in place of conventional medicine.
<h3>Acupuncture</h3> 
<p>Acupuncture is now a common alternative treatment for certain kinds of 
pain. It involves inserting small needles or exerting pressure on certain 
&quot;energy&quot; points in the body. When the pins have been placed 
successfully, the patient is supposed to experience a sensation that brings a 
feeling of fullness, numbness, tingling, and warmth with some soreness around 
the acupuncture point. Unfortunately, rigorous studies of acupuncture are 
difficult to perform, and most evidence on its benefits is weak. In any case, 
it may be specifically helpful for certain patients with back pain, such as 
pregnant women, who must avoid medications. Anyone who undergoes acupuncture 
should be sure it is performed in a reputable location by experienced 
practitioners who use sterilized equipment.</p>  Click the icon to see an image 
of acupuncture. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Massage Therapy</h3> 
<p>A number of well-conducted studies have supported the benefits of massage 
therapy for patients with chronic or acute back pain, especially when it is 
combined with exercise and patient education. In fact, one analysis in 2003 
suggested it may reduce the costs of care. However, it is usually not covered 
by insurance.</p> 
<h3>Mind-Body Techniques</h3> 
<p>According to a 2001 review of studies, only intensive programs that include 
both psychological and physical rehabilitation therapies were successful in 
reducing chronic low back pain and improving function. A number of effective 
approaches to low back pain -- collectively called mind-body techniques -- 
employ psychological, behavioral, or physical methods to promote relaxation and 
reduce stress. Although many may be helpful, evidence is lacking on the 
specific approaches that would be most successful and which patients would most 
likely benefit.</p> 
<p><i>Stress Reduction.</i> Stress reducing techniques, including relaxation 
methods and meditation, may be helpful. One study, for example, reported that 
meditation was beneficial in reducing pain and improving mood among chronic 
pain sufferers who had not responded to traditional care. Another found that 
after 3 weeks, patients who were in pain after back surgery had less discomfort 
and slept better after practicing relaxation imagery techniques while listening 
to music for 25 minutes a day.</p> 
<p><i>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</i>. Studies report that a course of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy helps reduce chronic back pain or at least 
enhances the patient's ability to deal with it. The primary goal of this form 
of therapy in such cases is to change the distorted perceptions that patients 
have of themselves and their approach to pain. Using specific tasks and 
self-observation, patients gradually shift their fixed ideas that they are 
helpless against the pain that dominates their lives to the perception that 
pain is only one negative and, to a degree, a manageable experience among many 
positive ones. In one study, therapists also taught relaxation techniques and 
methods to improve posture. The sessions lasted for 2.5 hours each week for 12 
weeks. More research is needed.</p> 
<p><i>Patient Education and Support Groups.</i> A 2002 study reported that 
patients with chronic low back pain who participated in an expert-moderated 
e-mail support and discussion group had less pain and disability after 12 
months. An Australian massive public-health campaign that educated patients and 
doctors about the importance of staying active and dispelled fears about 
long-term impairment from back pain dramatically reduced disability and worker 
compensation claims.</p> 
<h3>Spinal Manipulation</h3> 
<p><i>Spinal Manipulation for Uncomplicated Acute Low Back Pain.</i> Spinal 
manipulation may be useful for acute back pain that persists beyond 2 - 3 
weeks. There are a number of variations, but one example of a spinal 
manipulation technique is the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The patient first lies on their side.</li> 
<li>The practitioner grasps the exposed shoulder and either the hip or knee 
and then presses the upper and lower portions of the body in opposite 
directions, so that the torso rotates.</li> 
<li>The shifting vertebrae make a cracking or popping sound, indicating that 
they have exceeded the normal range of motion.</li> 
<li>Often this results in a greater sense of ease and mobility. (The effect, 
however, may be temporary.)</li> </ul> 
<p>Whether on-going manipulations relieve pain better that just one visit is a 
subject of debate. Some patients consider spinal manipulation to be highly 
effective for chronic low back pain. A major 2003 analysis, however, reported 
that current evidence did not support the benefits of spinal manipulation over 
general medical care or physical therapy for either acute or chronic back pain. 
[It was better than sham (fake) therapy, however.]</p> 
<p>Spinal manipulations are typically performed by chiropractors, but 
osteopathic doctors also perform them.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>One in three people with low back pain seek treatment from a chiropractor. 
Chiropractic was founded in the U.S. in the late 1800s. The specific goal of 
chiropractors is to perform spinal manipulations to improve nerve transmission. 
Many studies have now confirmed that patients feel more satisfied with their 
chiropractic care than with treatment from general practitioners.</li> 
<li>Osteopathy was also founded in the 1800s. Its core approach to healing 
also involves physical manipulation. Osteopathy manipulates the bones, muscles, 
and tendons to optimize blood circulation. The general direction of osteopathy 
over the years has widened to employ a broader range of treatments that now 
approach those of standard medicine. One 1999 study reported that osteopathy 
was as effective as medical treatment in relieving low back pain and patients 
required far less medication and physical therapy. Osteopathic treatment was 
also far less expensive than traditional back pain treatments.</li> </ul> 
<p>Both chiropractors and osteopaths offer verbal assurance and a precise 
treatment regimen. The direct physical connection through spinal manipulation 
reinforces the patient-practitioner relationship. The emotional effects of such 
connections may be as important for healing as the treatments themselves.</p> 
<p>Mild and temporary side effects from spinal manipulation are common. The 
potential for serious adverse effects from low back manipulations is low. It 
should be strongly noted, however, that serious complications (including stroke 
or spinal cord or neck injury) have been reported with manipulations of the 
neck. Although little research has been done on such complications, an English 
survey indicated that they are more frequent than commonly thought.</p> 
<p>Some chiropractors may take a lot of x-rays, particularly those of the full 
spine, which may have long-term harmful consequences. Patients should also be 
aware that some chiropractors use alternative treatments that have not been 
proven or rigorously studied. All patients should require objective evidence on 
the benefits of their treatments.</p> 
<p><i>Vertebral Axial Decompression.</i> Vertebral axial decompression (VAX-D) 
may reduce pain and improve function in patients with chronic low back pain, 
including sciatic pain that radiates down the leg. The patient lies face down 
on a special table, clutching hand grips and wearing a pelvic harness. The 
traction-like action alternately decompresses and relaxes the spine over 
1-minute intervals. Each session lasts about 30 minutes. Ten to 20 sessions on 
successive days are often required. The procedure is thought to alleviate pain 
and enhance healing by relieving pressure within the disks, promoting the 
in-flow of oxygen, fluids, and nutrients to the spinal column. Some evidence 
supports its benefits, with reported success rates of around 70%. Because it is 
considered experimental, it is not yet covered by most insurers. More studies 
are needed to confirm its possible benefits.</p> 
<h3>Electrical Stimulation</h3> 
<p><i>Percutaneous Neuromodulation Therapy.</i> A technique called 
percutaneous neuromodulation therapy (PNT) uses a small device delivers 
electrical stimulation to deep tissues and nerve pathways near the spine. It 
has shown some initial promise for relief of chronic back pain and may also 
improve mobility and sleep. Treatment sessions are conducted in the doctor's 
office and last about 30 minutes. A correct pattern of stimulation appears to 
be important for optimal relief and needs to be determined.</p> 
<p><i>Electric Nerve Stimulation.</i> Transcutaneous electric nerve 
stimulation (TENS) uses low-level electrical pulses to suppress back pain. A 
variant, percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), applies these pulses 
through a small needle to acupuncture points. The standard procedure is to give 
80 - 100 pulses per second for 45 minutes three times a day. The patients are 
barely aware of the sensation. Although a 2002 analysis of trials could find no 
direct evidence of benefit, small studies have reported some relief for chronic 
low back pain from either TENS or PENS. It is not known if these effects are 
long lasting. Neither approach is helpful for relief of acute low back pain in 
most patients.</p> 
<p><i>Muscle Stimulation.</i> Two investigative procedures called automated or 
electrical twitch obtaining intramuscular stimulation (ATOIMS or ETOIMS) are 
showing promise. ATOIMS uses an automated mechanical device that vibrates the 
muscle using a tiny pin. (The sensation is described as similar to a mosquito 
bite.) ETOIMS uses an extremely mild electrical current. They can also be used 
together. Both approaches cause the muscles to twitch and then relax then the 
process is stopped. Discomfort is minimal. Small studies are reporting some 
help in relieving a number of condition the cause chronic pain, including low 
back pain.</p> 
<p><em>Therapeutic ultrasound</em>. Therapeutic ultrasound involves placing a 
small wand or probe directly onto the skin. The wand gives off sound waves, 
which gently vibration the area. Scientists in England are studying whether 
therapeutic ultrasound may help relieve pain and disability due to sciatica.</p>
<p><i>Intradiscal Electrothermal Treatment (IDET).</i> Intradiscal 
electrothermal treatment (IDET) uses electricity to heat a painful disk. Heat 
is applied for about 15 minutes. Pain may temporarily feel worse, but after 
healing, the disk shrinks and becomes desensitized to pain. However, healing 
takes several weeks. The surgery may not work in obese patients.</p> 
<p>Some studies have reported positive benefits to IDET; others say it does 
not significantly reduce pain. A randomized, blinded study published in the 
November 2005 journal<i>Spine</i> found that IDET was no better than a sham 
(fake) procedure in relieving chronic back pain due to disk disease. For the 
study, patients were randomly selected to receive either IDET or a sham 
procedure. After 6 months, there was no difference in pain symptoms between the 
two groups.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Exercise and Physical Therapy 
<h3>The Role of Physical Therapy</h3> 
<p>Physical therapy with a trained professional may be useful if pain has not 
improved after 3 - 4 weeks. It is important for any person who has chronic low 
back pain to have an exercise program. Professionals who understand the 
limitations and special needs of back pain, and can address individual health 
conditions, should guide this program. One study indicated that patients who 
planned their own exercise program did worse than those in physical therapy or 
doctor-directed programs.</p> 
<p>Physical therapy typically includes the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The first stage involves patient education and training the patient in 
correct movement. Sometimes heat or electro-therapies (such as therapeutic 
ultrasound or low-energy lasers) are used, although their benefits are unproven.
</li> 
<li>If back pain persists beyond 5 weeks, physical therapy is used for 
rehabilitation. The exercises help the patient keep the spine in neutral 
positions during all daily activities.</li> </ul> 
<p>Incorrect movements or long-term high-impact exercise is often a cause of 
back pain in the first place. People vulnerable to back pain should avoid 
activities that put undue stress on the lower back or require sudden twisting 
movements, such as football, golf, ballet, and weight lifting.</p> 
<p>Exercises performed after a simple diskectomy do not seem to provide much 
added benefit over time.</p> 
<p>Specific and regular exercise under the guidance of a trained professional 
is important for reducing pain and improving function, although patients often 
find it difficult to maintain therapy.</p> 
<h3>Exercise and Acute or Subacute Back Pain</h3> 
<p>Exercise does not help acute back pain. In fact, overexertion may cause 
further harm. Beginning after 4 - 8 weeks of pain, however, a rehabilitation 
program may benefit the patient.</p> 
<p>An incremental aerobic exercise program (such as walking, stationary 
biking, and swimming) may begin within 2 weeks of symptoms. Jogging is usually 
not recommended, at least not until the pain is gone and muscles are stronger.
</p> 
<p>Patients should avoid exercises that put the lower back under pressure 
until the back muscles are well toned. Such exercises include leg lifts done in 
a facedown position, straight leg sit-ups, and leg curls using exercise 
equipment.</p> 
<p>In all cases, patients should never force themselves to exercise if, by 
doing so, the pain increases.</p> 
<h3>Exercise and Chronic Back Pain</h3> 
<p>Exercise plays a very beneficial role in chronic back pain. Repetition is 
the key to increasing flexibility, building endurance, and strengthening the 
specific muscles needed to support and neutralize the spine. Exercise should be 
considered as part of a broader program to return to normal home, work, and 
social activities. In this way, the positive benefits of exercise not only 
affect strength and flexibility but also alter and improve patients' attitudes 
toward their disability and pain. Exercise may also be effective when combined 
with a psychological and motivational program, such as cognitive-behavioral 
therapy.</p> 
<p>There are different types of back pain exercises. Stretching exercises work 
best for reducing pain, while strengthening exercises are best for improving 
function.</p> 
<p>Exercises for back pain include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Low Impact Aerobic Exercises.</em> Low-impact aerobic exercises, such 
as swimming, bicycling, and walking, can strengthen muscles in the abdomen and 
back without over-straining the back. Programs that use strengthening exercises 
while swimming may be a particularly beneficial approach for many patients with 
back pain. Medical research has shown that pregnant women who engaged in a 
water gymnastics program have less back pain and are able to continue working 
longer.</li> 
<li><em>Spine Stabilization and Strength Training.</em> Exercises called 
lumbar extension strength training are proving to be effective. Generally, 
these exercises attempt to strengthen the abdomen, improve lower back mobility, 
strength, and endurance, and enhance flexibility in the hip, the hamstring 
muscles, and the tendons at the back of the thigh.</li> 
<li><em>Yoga, Tai Chi, Chi Kung.</em> Practices originating in Asia that 
combine low-impact physical movements and meditation may be very helpful. They 
are designed to achieve a physical and mental balance and can be very helpful 
in preventing recurrences of low back pain.</li> 
<li><em>Pilates.</em> Pilates is an exercise practice that uses yoga 
principles, and may be specifically helpful for people with back pain.</li> 
<li><em>Flexibility Exercises.</em> Flexibility exercises may help reduce 
pain. A stretching program may work best when combined with strengthening 
exercises.</li> 
<li><em>Retraining Deep Muscles.</em> Some studies suggest a link between low 
back pain and impaired motor control of deep muscles of the back and trunk. 
According to these studies, contraction exercises specifically designed to 
retrain these muscles may be effective for patients with both acute and chronic 
pain.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Specific Exercises for Low Back Strength</h3> 
<p>Perform the following exercises at least three times a week:</p> 
<p><i>Partial Sit-ups.</i> Partial sit-ups or crunches strengthen the 
abdominal muscles.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep the knees bent and the lower back flat on the floor while raising the 
shoulders up 3 - 6 inches.</li> 
<li>Exhale on the way up, and inhale on the way down.</li> 
<li>Perform this exercise slowly 8 - 10 times with the arms across the chest.
</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Pelvic Tilt.</i> The pelvic tilt alleviates tight or fatigued lower back 
muscles.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lie on the back with the knees bent and feet flat on the floor.</li> 
<li>Tighten the buttocks and abdomen so that they tip up slightly.</li> 
<li>Press the lower back to the floor, hold for one second, and then relax.
</li> 
<li>Be sure to breathe evenly.</li> </ul> 
<p>Over time increase this exercise until it is held for 5 seconds. Then, 
extend the legs a little more so that the feet are further away from the body 
and try it again.</p> 
<p><i>Stretching Lower-Back Muscles.</i> The following are three exercises for 
stretching the lower back:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lie on the back with knees bent and legs together. Keeping arms at the 
sides, slowly roll the knees over to one side until totally relaxed. Hold this 
position for about 20 seconds (while breathing evenly) and then repeat on the 
other side.</li> 
<li>Lying on the back, hold one knee and pull it gently toward the chest. Hold 
for 20 seconds. Repeat with the other knee.</li> 
<li>While supported on hands and knees, lift and straighten right hand and 
left leg at the same time. Hold for 3 seconds while tightening the abdominal 
muscles. The back should be straight. Alternate with the other arm and leg and 
repeat on each side 8 - 20 times.</li> </ul> 
<p>Note: No one with low back pain should perform exercises that require 
bending over right after getting up in the morning. At that time, the disks are 
more fluid-filled and more vulnerable to pressure from this movement.</p> Back 
to Top <br>
 Surgery and Invasive Procedures 
<p>The health care provider should give patients solid information on the 
expected course of their low back pain and self-care options before discussing 
surgery. Patients should ask their health care provider about evidence favoring 
surgery or other (nonsurgical) treatments in their particular case. They should 
also ask about the long-term outcome of the recommended treatment. Would the 
improvements last and, if so, for how long? Another consideration when surgery 
is an option is the overall safety of the recommended procedure, weighed 
against its potential short-term benefits and its benefits in the long run.</p> 
<p>Patients should always try all possible non-surgical treatments before 
opting for surgery. The most common reasons for surgery for low back pain are 
sciatica and spinal stenosis. Some experts believe that fewer than 1% of back 
pain patients need aggressive medical or surgical treatments.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, when it is appropriate, surgery can provide great relief. 
Many approaches and procedures are available or being investigated. However, 
there have been few well-conducted studies to determine if any type of back 
pain surgery works better than others, or if a single procedure is better than 
no surgery at all.</p> 
<p>People who are obese and have low back pain may benefit from surgical 
weight loss surgery. A study in the journal<em>Obesity Surgery</em> found that 
bariatric (stomach stapling) surgery significantly improves the degree of 
disability in morbidly obese patients who have low back pain. Before having any 
surgery, it is extremely important that the patient is sure the surgeon has had 
significant experience with the procedure.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that surgery does not always improve outcome and, in 
some cases, can even make it worse. Surgery can be an extremely effective 
approach, however, for certain patients whose severe back pain does not respond 
to conservative measures.</p> 
<h3>Diskectomy</h3> 
<p>Diskectomy is the surgical removal of the diseased disk. The procedure 
relieves pressure on the spine. It has been performed for 40 years, and 
increasingly less invasive techniques developed over time. However, few studies 
have been conducted to determine the procedure's real effectiveness. In 
appropriate candidates it provides faster immediate relief than medical 
treatment, but long-term benefits (over 5 years) are uncertain. A number of 
minimally invasive variations are now available.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Microdiskectomy</i>. Microdiskectomy is the current standard procedure. 
It is performed through a small incision (1 to 1-1/2 inch). The back muscles 
are lifted and moved away from the spine. After identifying and moving the 
nerve root, the surgeon removes the injured disk tissue under it. The procedure 
does not change any of the structural supports of the spine, including joints, 
ligaments, and muscles.</p> 
<p>Other, less invasive procedures that are available include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Endoscopic Diskectomy.</em> Endoscopy employs a catheter (a thin tube) 
that contains tiny cameras and surgical instruments. The tube and attached 
instruments are inserted through small incisions. Various endoscopic approaches 
are proving to be useful for back surgery.</li> 
<li><em>Percutaneous diskectomy (PAD).</em> This approach uses a tube with an 
attached device at the tip that cuts away some of the nucleus pulposus. A 
vacuum then sucks this gelatinous matter out.</li> 
<li><em>Laser Diskectomy.</em> A number of investigative surgical procedures 
employ lasers. For example, endoscopic laser foraminoplasty (ELF) uses lasers 
to locate the likely source of pain and remove diseased tissue. The incision 
requires little more than a Band-Aid and complications are minimal. Long-term 
benefits are unknown, however.</li> </ul> 
<p>It is not clear yet if any of these less-invasive procedures are as 
effective as the standard microdiskectomy.</p> 
<p><i>Complications and Outlook.</i> Many patients still have back pain after 
diskectomy, which delays discharge from the hospital. Narcotics are usually 
needed for pain relief. Adding an injected NSAID may speed resolution of pain.
</p> 
<p>Scar tissue is a significant problem, since it can cause persistent low 
back pain afterward. Anti-scarring agents or certain devices may help reduce 
surgical scars and thereby postoperative pain. Other complications of spinal 
surgery can include nerve and muscle damage, infection, and the need for 
another operation.</p> 
<p>Patients now often remain in bed only 3 - 4 days after disk surgery. It may 
take 4 - 6 weeks for full recovery, however. Gentle exercise may be recommended 
at first. Starting intensive exercise 4 - 6 weeks after a first-time disk 
surgery appears to be very helpful for speeding up recovery.</p> 
<h3>Laminectomy</h3> 
<p>Operations that remove a vertebra (laminectomy) or shave off part of one 
(laminotomy) may be used in certain cases of spinal stenosis or 
spondylolisthesis to decompress the nerve. They may also be used to remove 
benign tumors on the spine.</p> Click the icon to see an illustrated series 
detailing lumbar spinal surgery. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Although this procedure often brings immediate relief from pain, there are 
small risks to the operation, and it is not always successful. Some recurrence 
of back pain and sciatica occurs in half to two-thirds of postoperative 
patients. Minimally invasive variations are under investigation. For spinal 
stenosis, the traditional approach is a laminectomy and partial removal of the 
facet joint. There is controversy whether performing a fusion procedure along 
with these procedures is needed. Only a few randomized trials have compared 
this procedure with nonoperative treatment. Their results suggest that surgical 
treatment is better, at least over the first 2 years after surgery.</p> 
<h3>Spinal Fusion</h3> 
<p>In cases where abnormal vertebrae position or movement, such as spinal 
stenosis or spondylolisthesis, is responsible for severe and chronic back pain, 
surgeons may fuse vertebrae together. Fusion uses a bone graft or some other 
device to join the vertebrae together. In a 2001 study of patients with severe 
long-term back pain, 33% of patients who had spinal fusion had less back pain 
after 2 years, compared to 7% who received conservative treatment with physical 
therapy. Pain improved most in the 6 months following surgery. However, a 2005 
clinical trial found that spinal fusion surgery worked no better than intensive 
rehabilitation in reducing disability. The intensive rehabilitation program 
included both physical and cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p> 
<p>Many spinal fusion surgeries use a tiny hollow metal cage, which is 
implanted into the disk space. Bone is then removed from the patient's hip and 
packed inside the cage. Over time the bone grows through the holes and around 
the device, fusing the vertebrae. Alternatively, rather than performing a bone 
graft, the cage is filled with a sponge-like material containing a 
genetically-engineered protein called InFuse (rhBMP-2) that promotes bone to 
grow.</p> Click the icon to see an illustrated series detailing spinal fusion. 
<br> <br>
<br>

<p>There are currently a number of video-assisted fusion techniques. These new 
techniques are less invasive than standard &quot;open&quot; surgical 
approaches, which use wide incisions. To date, however, the newer procedures 
have higher complication rates than the open approaches, and some medical 
centers have abandoned them.</p> 
<h3>Other Surgical Procedures</h3> 
<p><em>Percutaneous Vertebroplasty</em>. Percutaneous vertebroplasty involves 
the injection of a cement-like bone substitute into vertebrae with compression 
fractures. It is done under endoscopic and x-ray guidance. The technique is 
proving useful for stabilizing the spine and relieving pain in patients with 
spinal compression fractures due to osteoporosis or cancer. A Mayo Clinic study 
found that patients who have the procedure have less back pain during rest and 
activity. A survey of records from more than 100 vertebroplasty patients 
revealed that most patients are more functional than before the procedure, and 
the benefits lasted for up to a year.</p> 
<p>Warning: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned consumers that 
polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, used during vertebroplasty, could leak. 
Such leakage could cause damage to soft tissues and nerves. It is extremely 
important that the patient is sure that the health care provider has had 
significant experience performing the vertebroplasty procedure.</p> 
<p><em>Percutaneous kyphoplasty</em>. The health care provider injects bone 
cement into the space surrounding a fractured vertebra. (Vertebroplasty injects 
the cement directly into the vertebra.) Kyphoplasty is used to stabilize the 
spine and return spinal height to as normal as possible. However, a review, 
published in 2006 by a nonprofit health services research agency, found that 
the technique does not improve a person's back pain or quality of life. 
Kyphoplasty should only be done if bed rest, medicines, and physical therapy do 
not relieve back pain. Those with severe fractures or spinal infections should 
not have kyphoplasty.</p> 
<p><em>Artificial Disk Replacement</em>. Total disk replacement is an 
investigative procedure for some patients with severely damaged disks. The 
technique implants artificial disks (ProDisc, Link, SB Charite) consisting of 
two metal plates and a soft core. The surgery can be performed using a 
minimally invasive laparoscopic procedure, which is performed through tiny cuts 
using miniature tools and viewing devices. A study in 2003 was the first to 
suggest that it may eventually achieve results that are comparable to standard 
surgeries for disk herniation. An artificial cushioning device called the 
prosthetic disk nucleus (PDN) replaces only the inner gel-like core (nucleus 
pulposus) within the intervertebral space, rather than the entire disk. It is 
showing promise in early studies.</p> 
<p><em>Radiofrequency Nerve Destruction.</em> Radiofrequencies are being used 
to destroy nerves involved in the facet joints (or z-joints), which connect the 
vertebrae. Evidence is still weak on its benefits. A 2003 analysis suggested 
that it may be beneficial, however, for relief of neck pain and possibly for 
low back pain caused by problems in the facets joints. Serious infections have 
been reported with this treatment, however.</p> 
<p><em>Intradiscal Electrothermal Treatment (IDET).</em> Intradiscal 
electrothermal treatment (IDET) uses electricity to heat a painful disk. Heat 
is applied for about 15 minutes. Pain may temporarily feel worse, but after 
healing, the disk shrinks and becomes desensitized to pain. However, healing 
takes several weeks. While some studies have reported benefit, many consider 
the evidence to support the use of this procedure weak.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Other Treatments 
<p> <i>Radiofrequency Nerve Destruction.</i> Radiofrequencies are being used 
to destroy nerves involved in the facet joints (or z-joints), which connect the 
vertebrae. Evidence is still weak on its benefits. A 2003 analysis suggested 
that it may be beneficial, however, for relief of neck pain and possibly for 
low back pain caused by problems in the facets joints. Serious infections have 
been reported.</p> 
<p> <em>Stem cell treatments</em>. Researchers in England have pioneered a new 
technique to grow new spinal tissue using the patient's own stem cells. Stem 
cells are the building blocks of specific cells. Every cell in the human body 
starts (or &quot;stems&quot;) from a stem cell. The new tissue will replace 
damaged spinal tissue and may relieve low back pain. Researchers expect the 
treatment to enter pre-clinical trials in about 1 year.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Prevention And Self-Care 
<p>Most patients should understand that they are likely to improve over the 
first month after their low back pain begins, often with no treatments.</p> 
<h3>Home Care Tips for Relieving Pain</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Resume normal activity as soon as possible. Bed rest is no longer 
recommended and may delay recovery. Activities should be done without strain or 
stretching.</li> 
<li>Avoid intense exercise and physical activity, particularly heavy lifting 
and trunk twisting, if there is acute back pain.</li> 
<li>Try an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory such as aspirin or 
ibuprofen. These medicines often provide significant benefits.</li> 
<li>Apply heat (104&deg; F) to the painful area. Heat may work better than 
ibuprofen or acetaminophen. One group of researchers found that people with low 
back pain who wear low-level heat wraps for 8 hours a day have significantly 
less pain and disability.</li> 
<li>Try alternating between hot and cold packs. Some doctors recommend 
changing from hot to cold every 3 minutes and repeating this sequence three 
times. Others believe ice packs should be applied first. This routine should be 
done two or three times during the day. (Note: Heat or cold treatments do not 
have much effect on sciatica.)</li> 
<li>Supportive back belts, braces, or corsets may help some people 
temporarily, but these products can reduce muscle tone over time and should be 
used only briefly.</li> 
<li>Get plenty of sleep. Healthy sleep plays a vital role in recovery. Avoid 
caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and unwind before bed by taking a warm 
bath or practicing relaxation techniques. It is often difficult to get a good 
night's sleep when suffering from back pain, particularly because the pain can 
intensify at night. Some people may need medicine to help manage nighttime pain 
or treat sleeplessness. Lying curled up in a fetal position with a pillow 
between the knees or lying on the back with a pillow under the knees may help.
</li> 
<li>Yoga relieves low back pain better than conventional exercise or self-help 
books, according to a study published in the<em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>
. For the study, 101 adults with low back pain were randomly assigned to one of 
three groups. One group attended yoga classes and lessons; the second did 
aerobics, weight training, and stretching; the third group read a self-help 
book about back pain. After 12 weeks, those who took yoga could better perform 
daily activities requiring the back than those in the other two groups. After 
26 weeks, those who took yoga had less pain and better back function, and used 
fewer pain relievers than the others.</li> </ul> 
<p>Exercise, diet, stress, and weight all have a significant influence on back 
pain. Changing certain lifestyle factors can help reduce, and possibly prevent, 
backaches.</p> 
<h3>Quit Smoking</h3> 
<p>Smokers are at higher risk for back problems, perhaps because smoking 
decreases blood circulation. The link may also be due to an unhealthy lifestyle 
in general. A British study found that young adults who were long-term smokers 
were nearly twice as likely to develop low back pain as nonsmokers were.</p> 
<h3>Exercise and Obesity</h3> 
<p><i>Sedentary Lifestyle.</i> People who do not exercise regularly face an 
increased risk for low back pain, especially when they perform sudden, 
stressful activities such as shoveling, digging, or moving heavy items. 
Although no definitive studies have been done to prove the relationship between 
lack of exercise and low back pain, some doctors believe that an inactive 
lifestyle may be to blame in some cases. Lack of exercise leads to the 
following conditions that may threaten the back:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Stiff muscles can make it hard to move, rotate, and bend the back.</li> 
<li>Weak stomach muscles can increase the strain on the back and cause an 
abnormal tilt of the pelvis.</li> 
<li>Weak back muscles may increase the risk for disk compression.</li> 
<li>Obesity puts more weight on the spine and increases pressure on the 
vertebrae and disks. However, studies report only a weak association between 
obesity and low back pain.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Improper or Intense Exercise.</i> Improper or excessive exercise may 
also increase one's chances for back pain.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Some research suggests that over time, high-impact exercise may increase 
the risk for degenerative disk disease. A survey of people who played tennis, 
however, found no increased risk for low back pain or sciatica.</li> 
<li>Between 30 - 70% of cyclists experience low back pain. One study reported 
that 70% of cyclists reported improvement simply by adjusting the angle of the 
bicycle seat.</li> 
<li>Improper exercise instruction and inattention to body movements can lead 
to back trouble. For example, a single jerky golf swing or incorrect use of 
exercise equipment (especially free weights, nautilus, and rowing machines) can 
cause serious back injuries.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tips for Daily Movement and Inactivity</h3> 
<p>The way a person moves, stands, or sleeps plays a major role in back pain.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Maintaining good posture is very important. This means keeping the ears, 
shoulders, and hips in a straight line with the head up and stomach pulled in. 
It is best not to stand for long periods of time. If it is necessary, walk as 
much as possible and wear shoes without heels, preferably with cushioned soles. 
Use a low foot stool and alternate resting each foot on top of it.</li> 
<li>Sitting puts the most pressure on the back. Chairs should either have 
straight backs or low-back support. If possible, chairs should swivel to avoid 
twisting at the waist, have arm rests, and adjustable backs. While sitting, the 
knees should be a little higher than the hip, so a low stool or hassock is 
useful to put the feet on. A small pillow or rolled towel behind the lower back 
helps relieve pressure while either sitting or driving.</li> 
<li>Riding in or driving a car for long periods of time increases stress. Move 
the car seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending forward. The back of 
the seat should not be reclined more than 30 degrees. If possible, the seat 
bottom should be tilted slightly upward in front. A traveler should stop and 
walk around about every hour. Avoid lifting or carrying objects immediately 
after the ride.</li> 
<li>A common cause of temporary back pain in children is carrying backpacks 
that are too heavy. Backpacks should not weigh more than 20% of the child's 
body weight. They should weigh even less for very young children. Emotional or 
behavioral problems may also contribute to back pain in children.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tips for Lifting and Bending</h3> 
<p>Anyone who engages in heavy lifting should take precautions when lifting 
and bending.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If an object is too heavy or awkward, get help.</li> 
<li>Spread your feet apart to give yourself a wide base of support.</li> 
<li>Stand as close as possible to the object being lifted.</li> 
<li>Bend at the knees, not at the waist. As you move up and down, tighten 
stomach muscles and tuck buttocks in so that the pelvis is rolled under and the 
spine remains in a natural &quot;S' curve. (Even when not lifting an object, 
always try to use this posture when stooping down.)</li> 
<li>Hold objects close to the body to reduce the load on the back.</li> 
<li>Lift using the leg muscles, not those in the back.</li> 
<li>Stand up without bending forward from the waist.</li> 
<li>Never twist from the waist while bending or lifting any heavy object. If 
you need to move an object to one side, point your toes in that direction and 
pivot toward it.</li> 
<li>If an object can be moved without lifting, pull it, don't push.</li> </ul>

 Prognosis 
<p>Most people with acute low back pain are back at work within a month and 
fully recover within a few months. According to one study, about a third of 
patients with uncomplicated low back pain significantly improved after a week; 
two-thirds recovered by 7 weeks.</p> 
<p>However, studies now suggest that up to 75% of patients suffer at least one 
recurrence of back pain over the course of a year. In another study, after 4 
years, less than half were symptom-free. Some doctors are approaching the 
problem as one that is not necessarily curable and which needs a consistent 
on-going approach.</p> 
<p>Specific conditions can determine the rate of improvement:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In the majority of patients with herniated disks, the condition improves 
(although the actual physical improvement may be slower than the reduction in 
pain). Researchers attempted to identify factors most likely to predict an 
elevated risk for recurrent pain and found that only depression was a 
significant factor in the majority of those who had not recovered.</li> 
<li>Spinal stenosis stabilizes in about 70% of cases and worsens in 15%.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Effects on Work</h3> 
<p>Studies have found that when people stay home because of back injury, only 
65% are back at work within a week. Nearly 14% are still absent at one month. 
If someone is on disability for more than 6 months, the chance of them 
returning to work is only 50%.</p> 
<p>Low back pain accounts for significant losses in work days and dollars. In 
1990, it cost the U.S. $23 billion in direct medical costs and possibly as much 
as $85 billion in total costs (such as lost productivity). Chronic back pain 
has become one of the most expensive causes of disability among workers under 
the age of 45. One study found that, although severe back pain comprised only 
10% of workers compensation cases, it accounted for 86% of compensation costs.
</p> Back to Top <br>
 Complications 
<p>Certain warning signs should alert a patient to see a doctor immediately 
for low back pain. Any very severe back pain warrants attention, particularly 
if any of the following conditions are present:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Being over 50</li> 
<li>Recent injury</li> 
<li>Severe pain</li> 
<li>Pain awakens the person at night</li> 
<li>Pain accompanied by fever (possible infection)</li> 
<li>Pain increased by lying down</li> 
<li>Pain unrelated to movement</li> 
<li>Pain lasts for a month, and is accompanied by unexplained fever or weight 
loss</li>

<h3>Cauda Equina Syndrome</h3> 
<p>Cauda equina syndrome is the impingement of the cauda equina (the four 
strands of nerves leading through the lowest part of the spine). It is an 
emergency condition that can cause severe complications of the bowel or 
bladder. Cauda equina syndrome is usually caused by massive extrusion of the 
disk material. It can cause permanent incontinence if not promptly treated with 
surgery. Symptoms of the cauda equina syndrome include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dull back pain</li> 
<li>Weakness or numbness in the buttocks, in the area between the legs, or in 
the inner thigh, backs of legs, or feet. May cause difficulty in standing or 
stumbling.</li> 
<li>An inability to control urination and defecation</li> 
<li>Pain accompanied by fever (can indicate an infection)</li> </ul> Back to

 Prevention 
<p>Exercise, diet, stress, and weight all have a significant influence on back 
pain. Changing certain lifestyle factors can help reduce and, possibly, prevent 
backaches.</p> 
<h3>Quit Smoking</h3> 
<p>Smokers are at higher risk for back problems, perhaps because smoking 
decreases blood circulation. The link may also be due to an unhealthy lifestyle 
in general. A British study found that young adults who were long-term smokers 
were nearly twice as likely to develop low back pain as nonsmokers.</p> 
<h3>Exercise and Obesity</h3> 
<p> <i>Sedentary Lifestyle.</i> People who do not exercise regularly face an 
increased risk for low back pain, especially when they perform sudden, 
stressful activities such as shoveling, digging, or moving heavy items. 
Although no definitive studies have been done to prove the relationship between 
lack of exercise and low back pain, some doctors believe that an inactive 
lifestyle may be to blame in some cases. Lack of exercise leads to the 
following conditions that may threaten the back:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Stiff muscles can make it hard to move, rotate, and bend the back.</li> 
<li>Weak stomach muscles can increase the strain on the back and cause an 
abnormal tilt of the pelvis.</li> 
<li>Weak back muscles may increase the risk for disk compression.</li> 
<li>Obesity puts more weight on the spine and increase pressure on the 
vertebrae and disks. However, studies report only a weak association between 
obesity and low back pain.</li> </ul> 
<p> <i>Improper or Intense Exercise.</i> Improper or excessive exercise may 
also increase one's chances for back pain.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Some research suggests that over time, high-impact exercise may increase 
the risk for degenerative disk disease. A survey of people who played tennis, 
however, found no increased risk for low back pain or sciatica.</li> 
<li>Between 30 - 70% of cyclists experience low back pain. One 1999 study 
reported that 70% of cyclists reported improvement simply by adjusting the 
angle of the bicycle seat.</li> 
<li>Improper exercise instruction and inattention to body movements can lead 
to back trouble. For example, a single jerky golf swing or incorrect use of 
exercise equipment (especially free weights, nautilus, and rowing machines) can 
cause serious back injuries.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tips for Daily Movement and Inactivity</h3> 
<p>The way a person moves, stands, or sleeps plays a major role in back pain.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Maintaining good posture is very important. This means keeping the ears, 
shoulders, and hips in a straight line with the head up and stomach pulled in. 
It is best not to stand for long periods of time. If it is necessary, walk as 
much as possible and wear shoes without heels, preferably with cushioned soles. 
Use a low foot stool and alternate resting each foot on top of it.</li> 
<li>Sitting puts the most pressure on the back. Chairs should either have 
straight backs or low-back support. If possible, chairs should swivel to avoid 
twisting at the waist, have arm rests, and adjustable backs. While sitting, the 
knees should be a little higher than the hip, so a low stool or hassock is 
useful to put the feet on. A small pillow or rolled towel behind the lower back 
helps relieve pressure while either sitting or driving.</li> 
<li>Riding in and driving a car for long periods of time increases stress. 
Move the car seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending forward. The back 
of the seat should not be reclined more than 30 degrees. If possible, the seat 
bottom should be tilted slightly upward in front. A traveler should stop and 
walk around about every hour. Avoid lifting or carrying objects immediately 
after the ride.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tips for Lifting and Bending</h3> 
<p>Anyone who engages in heavy lifting should take precautions when lifting 
and bending.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If an object is too heavy or awkward, get help.</li> 
<li>Spread your feet apart to give a wide base of support.</li> 
<li>Stand as close as possible to the object being lifted.</li> 
<li>Bend at the knees, not at the waist. As you move up and down, tighten 
stomach muscles and tuck buttocks in so that the pelvis is rolled under and the 
spine remains in a natural &quot;S' curve. (Even when not lifting an object, 
always try to use this posture when stooping down.)</li> 
<li>Hold objects close to the body to reduce the load on the back.</li> 
<li>Lift using the leg muscles, not those in the back.</li> 
<li>Stand up without bending forward from the waist.</li> 
<li>Never twist from the waist while bending or lifting any heavy object. If 
you need to move an object to one side, point your toes in that direction and 
pivot toward it.</li> 
<li>If an object can be moved without lifting, pull it, don't push.</li> </ul>
