<br> Comments: 70 <br>

<p>Of all the posts I and my cobloggers have written for SBM over the last 15 
months, most provoke relatively few comments. However, a few stand out for 
having provoked hundreds of comments. The very first post that provoked 
hundreds of comments was Harriet&rsquo;s excellent discussion of the
International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics. In fact, Harriet seems to be 
quite good at writing posts that provoke a lot of comment, as another of her 
posts, specifically the one in which shediscussed circumcision, also garnered 
hundreds of comments. However, to my great surprise, the one post that stands 
out as having received the most comments thus far in the history of SBM is one 
that I wrote. Specifically, it was a post I calledDeath by 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine: Who&rsquo;s to blame?, which has collected 
an astonishing 611 comments thus far. The topic of the post was a case report 
that I had heard while visiting the tumor board of an affiliate of my former 
cancer center describing a young woman who had rejected conventional therapy 
for an eminently treatable breast cancer and then returned two or three years 
later with a large, nasty tumor that was much more difficult to treat and 
possibly metastatic to the bone, which would make it no longer even potentially 
curable. My discussion centered on what the obligation of a physician is to 
such patients who utterly refuse the science- and evidence-based medicine that 
we know to be able to cure them of a potentially fatal disease, and I was not 
only surprised but somewhat taken aback by the vehemence of the discussion.</p> 
<p>Since that post, I&rsquo;ve always been meaning to take a look at what, 
exactly, the effect of choosing &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine over 
&ldquo;conventional&rdquo; medicine is on the odds of survival for breast 
cancer patients. Even though intuitively one would hypothesize that refusing 
scientific medicine and relying on placebo medicine instead would have a 
detrimental effect on survival, it turns out that this question is not as easy 
to answer as you might think. For example, if you do a search on PubMed using 
terms like &ldquo;alternative medicine,&rdquo; &ldquo;breast cancer,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;survival,&rdquo; the vast majority of the hits will be studies of 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and breast cancer with little 
reference to what possible effect these therapies might have on survival. I can 
envision several reasons for this, the first being 
that&ndash;thankfully&ndash;relatively few women actually use alternative 
medicine exclusively to treat their breast cancer. Also, those that do probably 
drop off the radar screen of their science-based practitioners, and it is 
difficult, if not impossible, to capture data regarding their outcomes, given 
that they all too often stick with their alternative healers until the end. 
True, they may pop up again in their surgeon&rsquo;s or primary care 
doctor&rsquo;s office with huge, fungating tumors, only to be told that they 
have to undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before any surgery is 
possible, after which they will often disappear again. Another important reason 
is that the natural history of breast cancer is extremely variable, from nasty, 
aggressive tumors that kill within months to indolent, slow-growing tumors 
that, even when metastatic, women can survive with for several years. (It is, 
of course, these women who usually show up in &ldquo;alternative 
medicine&rdquo; testimonials, because they can survive a long time with little 
or no treatment before their tumors progress.)<br>
<br>
 Because it&rsquo;s 
important to understand the natural history of breast cancer, I&rsquo;ll 
reference a classic study examining the natural history of untreated breast 
cancer. It was published in 1962 byH. J. G. Bloom, W. W. Richardson, and E. J. 
Harries, and examined data from Middlesex Hospital from 1805 to 1933 where 250 
cases of untreated breast cancer were identified and studied. They calculated 
survival as the period of time from onset of symptoms to death. What they found 
was that 18% of the 250 patients survived five years; 3.6% survived 10 years; 
and 0.8% survived 15 years. Of note, it was 19 years before all patients were 
dead. Overall, the median survival was 2.7 years. A survival graph from this 
classic paper is below:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It should be noted that all of these tumors were detected as (at the very 
minimum) lumps in the breast, given that there was no other way of detecting 
them at the time. However, the reason we go back to this study time and time 
again is because, at least in developed countries, it is the rare woman with 
breast cancer who does not undergo treatment of some kind for it. These days, 
most tumors are detected at far less advanced stages; indeed, most are detected 
by mammography. What that means is that, if such a study could be done today, 
it is very likely thatlead time bias would significantly increase the apparent 
median survival, because increasingly tiny tumors are being found. It is also 
possible that a significant number of such small tumorsmay spontaneously regress
, which further complicates the issue today, not to mention making it easier to 
find women who have rejected some or all of &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; medicine 
to treat their cancers and survived significant lengths of time to produce
alternative medicine testimonials.</p> 
<p>With this background, I have found a couple of studies that can help answer 
the question. The first one was published in 2005 in theAnnals of Surgery by a 
group in from Geneva University Hospitals. This study involved a search of 
Switzerland&rsquo;s database between 1975 and 2000 and included 5,339 patients 
diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer. The strength of this study is that 
the Geneva Cancer Registry includes data from all patients from the Geneva 
canton who underwent treatment and allowed the investigators to compare the 
outcomes of the women who refused to undergo surgery with curative intent with 
those who underwent surgery. In the Registry, there were identified 70 patients 
(1.3%) who refused surgery and concluded:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>These women [those who refused surgery] were older, more frequently single, 
and had larger tumors. Overall, 37 (53%) women had no treatment, 25 (36%) 
hormone-therapy alone, and 8 (11%) other adjuvant treatments alone or in 
combination. Five-year specific breast cancer survival of women who refused 
surgery was lower than that of those who accepted (72%, 95% confidence 
interval, 60%&ndash;84% versus 87%, 95% confidence interval, 86%&ndash;88%, 
respectively). After accounting for other prognostic factors including tumor 
characteristics and stage, women who refused surgery had a 2.1-fold (95% 
confidence interval, 1.5&ndash;3.1) increased risk to die of breast cancer 
compared with operated women.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It is true that this is not a randomized study; rather, it is a 
retrospective study. Consequently, it&rsquo;s impossible to rule out selection 
bias, but, as the authors point out, this is one case where doing a randomized 
study is completely unethical. Moreover, half the women accepted some form of 
other standard, effective treatm,ent, such as hormonal therapy alone. In any 
case, what this study shows is that women with no surgery can still live a long 
time, but are far more likely to die of their cancer than women who do undergo 
surgical extirpation.</p> 
<p>As far as I can find, there is one study that specifically looked at the 
question of what happens to women who opt for alternative medicine instead of 
scientific medicine. This study, like the one I just cited, was published in 
the surgical literature, namelyAmerican Journal of Surgery. Given the nature of 
the question it was seeking to answer, its design is single-armed and 
retrospective, using prognosis estimated byAdjuvant! Online, an online tool 
into which clinicians can enter prognostic factors of a breast cancer at the 
time of presentation and come up with an estimate of chances of survival and 
recurrence with and without treatment. This, of course, is a weakness, but, 
again, randomizing patients to scientific medicine or alternative medicine 
would be completely unethical. In the case of such questions, we scientists 
have to make do with whatever methodology we can; i.e., do the best we can with 
what we have. Unfortunately, the study was also small, only 33 patients. Even 
so, given the huge difficulties involved in undertaking such a study, the 
investigators, who, as private practitioners operating a community practice in 
Eugene, OR, went above and beyond the call by trying to look at their data and 
answer this question. That their study has a number of shortcomings is not 
their fault; they appear to haved done the best they could with what they had, 
which includes patients who underwent a panoply of alternative therapies, 
including coral calcium, herbal therapy, mushrooms, high dose vitamins, whey, 
chelation therapy, hemlock, and coenzyme Q10.</p> 
<p>So what were their findings?</p> 
<p>They&rsquo;re summed up in the following table:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The authors comment:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We found that the overwhelming majority of the patients who initially 
refused surgical treatment for breast cancer developed disease progression. 
Five of these patients ultimately underwent surgical resection. Of the other 6 
patients, 5 had developed metastatic disease that precluded benefit from 
surgery. Furthermore, the disease progression caused by the delay in surgery 
was associated with an increase in the estimated 10-year mortality rate.</p> 
<p>Patients who declined chemotherapy or hormone therapy faired slightly 
better. Optimism for this strategy should be severely tempered by the fact that 
the length of follow-up evaluation in these patients was relatively short, and 
these patients had early stage (I or II) disease. By software estimates, the 
10-year mortality rate for these patients is still expected to be more than 50% 
higher than it would have been if the patients had taken their recommended 
therapy.</p> 
<p>A number of patients who expressed their intention to pursue alternative 
therapies did not return for follow-up evaluation. Attempts were made to 
contact these patients. Those for whom follow-up evaluation was unavailable 
were excluded from this study. Although their omission may introduce a 
selection bias in the results, the effect of this bias is expected to be small 
because relatively few patients (14 of 47) were in this category.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I find two points important about this study. First, it confirms once again 
the importance of surgery as a therapeutic modality for breast cancer, 
especially early stage. Second, and more importantly, it strongly suggests that 
foregoing or delaying surgery or chemotherapy is at the very least associated 
with a significantly decreased chance of recurrence-free survival. The authors 
do note that it is impossible to tell whether this increase in mortality was 
solely due to delay or refusal of effective therapy or whether the modalities 
chosen were deleterious. My guess is that it was almost certainly due to the 
ineffectiveness of the alternative therapies chosen.</p> 
<p>More evidence of the uselessness of &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine in 
breast cancer was published two years ago by Edzard Ernst, author of<em>
Healing, Hype or Harm? A Critical Analysis of Complementary or Alternative 
Medicine</em>, which Harriet reviewed about a month ago. In 2006, he wrote a 
review for the<em>Breast Journal</em> along with Katja Schmidt, MSc, C Psychol, 
and Michael Baum, MD, ChM, a review entitledComplementary/Alternative Therapies 
for the Treatment of Breast Cancer. A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical 
Trials and a Critique of Current Terminology. The objective of the study was to 
examine all studies randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for &ldquo;alternative 
cancer cures&rdquo; (ACCs). Treatments examined included various methods of 
psychosocial support such as group support therapy, cognitive behavioral 
therapy cognitive existential group therapy, a combination of muscle relaxation 
training and guided imagery, the Chinese herbal remedy Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, 
thymus extract, transfer factor, melatonin, and factor AF2.</p> 
<p>The first finding was that the methodological quality of the studies was, 
by and large, pretty low. The most common deficiencies included: lack of power 
sample calculation; small sample size; lack of adequate randomization and/or 
(patient and assessor or only assessor) blinding; and insufficient follow-up 
periods. It was noted that only one trial applied anintention to treat analysis
. From the 15 studies Ernst examined, this is what was concluded:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The totality of the data fails to show a single intervention that would be 
demonstrably effective as an ACC. The paucity and the often-low methodological 
quality of the RCTs are as unexpected to us as they are disappointing. Most 
trails had small sample sizes; thus a type II error is conceivable. But even if 
this were true, one would be correct in stating that to date, no effective ACC 
has been identified.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A lot of this is, of course, true based on discussions of prior 
plausibility alone. One could argue that, given the poor quality of the studies 
examined by Ernst, there might be an effect that was missed. However, if an 
effect were missed, it would have to be small or, at most, moderate. That is 
not what is claimed for many of these ACCs. What is often claimed is a 
near-miraculous &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for cancer, which, if it were true, would be 
relatively easy to detect. As I&rsquo;ve often argued about, for example, the 
Gonzalez regimen for pancreatic cancer, if such ACCs really were cures, it 
would actually be fairly easy to show. In the case of pancreatic cancer, for 
instance, just producing well documented case reports of a few five year 
survivors among patients with documented metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas would, I daresay, make even Wally Sampson and Kimball Atwood sit up 
and take notice. Somehow, we never see this. Of course, what makes the question 
in breast cancer more difficult to answer is its highly variable natural 
history. In contrast, the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer die 
within the first year (more than half die within six months); fewer still live 
beyond two years; and very close to none live beyond three years. In contrast, 
lots of women with metastatic breast cancer live longer than two or three 
years; a few.</p> 
<p>Finally, about five years ago, there was a study out of Norway that looked 
at the effect of alternative medicine on cancer survival. This study did not 
limit itself to breast cancer, but it is interesting and useful nonetheless. 
The hypothesis of the study was that the use of alternative medicine does not 
have any effect on the survival of cancer patients, and to test the hypothesis 
investigators studied data from surveys done by the Norwegian Board of Health, 
which asked patients standard demographic information, but then asked them 
about their use of alternative medicine as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In the questionnaire presented to the patients, AM was defined as any 
treatment outside of mainstream therapy that had been used to treat their 
cancer. A multiple-choice list consisting of the best known and frequently used 
non-proven methods in Norway was presented. Patients also had the opportunity 
to add other types of alternative therapy in response to an open question.</p> 
<p>The following alternative methods were described in the multiple choice 
questionnaire: Use of biological treatments, herbs, faith healing or healing by 
hand, homeopathy, reflexology (zone therapy), megadoses of vitamins, diet 
treatments, injection therapies such as iscador (a mistletoe preparation) and a 
Norwegian injection therapy called &ldquo;Nitter therapy&rdquo;. Nitter therapy 
consists of vitamin B12, gammaglobulins, tranexamic acid, multivitamins and 
nutritional supplements.</p> 
<p>Modalities such as relaxation, psychotherapy, participation in a self-help 
group or changes in lifestyle activities that were used to reduce distress and 
to improve the patient&rsquo;s subjective well being were not coded as AM.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I actually very much approve of the fact that the investigators did not 
define relaxation, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, etc., as 
&ldquo;alternative.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A total of 515 patients were analyzed, and results were as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In January 2001, survival data were obtained with a follow-up of 8 years 
for 515 cancer patients. A total of 112 (22%) assessable patients used AM. 
During the follow-up period, 350 patients died. Death rates were higher in AM 
users (79%) than in those who did not use AM (65%). In a Cox regression model 
adjusted for demographic, disease and treatment factors, the hazard ratio of 
death for any use of AM compared with no use was 1.30, (95% Confidence Interval 
(CI) 0.99, 1.70; P=0.056), suggesting that AM use may predict a shorter 
survival. Sensitivity analyses strengthened the negative association between AM 
use and survival. AM use had the most detrimental effect in patients with an 
ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status (PS) of 0 (hazard 
ratio for USE=2.32, 95% CI, 1.44, 3.74, P=0.001), when compared with an ECOG PS 
of 1 or higher. The use of AM seems to predict a shorter survival from cancer. 
The effect appears predominantly in patients with a good PS.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In other words, not surprisingly, use of alternative medicine is correlated 
with poorer surival in the patients with a good performance status and thus who 
are likely to have a more favorable prognosis. Patients with a poor performance 
status are more likely to undergo less aggressive therapy because they are less 
able to tolerate, for example, radical surgery or heavy-duty chemotherapy 
regimens.</p> 
<p>The authors speculated about a number of reasons why use of alternative 
medicine might be associated with poorer survival. Obviously, it may not be 
causative. (Remember again that correlation does not necessarily equal 
causation. One possible explanation is that users of alternative medicine are 
less likely to undergo optimal medical therapy. One interesting possibility is 
that users of alternative medicine were more likely to be having severe 
symptoms, which led them to turn to &ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo; to try 
to relieve their symptoms. In any case, this study had a number of problems, 
including a high attrition rate that could have resulted in significant 
selection bias.</p> 
<p>Putting it all together, I conclude that there is no compelling evidence 
for a significant survival benefit due to any &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; 
therapy, nor is there good evidence for significant treatment effects. The 
studies that do purport to show an effect are virtually all plagued with 
methodological difficulties and tend to show effects that are barely above 
background noise. Even the much touted psychosocial support of late hasfailed 
to demonstrate any improvement in the survival of cancer patients. Moreover, 
although there is a relative paucity of studies, and they, too, are generally 
retrospective and difficult to interpret, what evidence is out there is that 
alternative medicine use among cancer patients is associated with an increased 
risk of dying from cancer, particularly when conventional therapy is eschewed. 
Taken together, these data make it very hard not to conclude that at best the 
vast majority of alternative therapies are either useless, no more than 
placebos, or might even be harmful. That is why they have no role in 
science-based medicine at present.</p> 
<p>As Edzard Ernst put it:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The idea of an &ldquo;alternative cancer cure&rdquo; assumes that 
conventional oncology would not adopt a cancer treatment simply because it 
originates from an area outside of mainstream medicine. We feel that, should 
such a cure one day emerge, it would be investigated without delay by 
oncologists and adopted into routine care as soon as the data supporting it are 
convincing. Plant-based cancer medications such as Vincristin and Vinblastin 
(both extracted from the plant<em>Vinca rosea</em>) or Taxol (<em>Taxus baccata
</em>) could be employed to back up this theory. It follows that the term ACC 
is and most likely will always be a contradiction in terms.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Or, as I frequently put it: There is no such thing as 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine. There is medicine that is effective, 
medicine that is not, and medicine that has not been tested yet. Nearly all of 
so-called &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine falls into one of the latter two 
categories, and those that have not been tested yet nearly all fall into the 
category of being so wildly improbable that testing them without more positive 
evidence makes no sense. In any case, as a cancer surgeon, I don&rsquo;t care 
where a therapy came from. I really don&rsquo;t. If someone could show me that
<em>reiki</em> or homeopathy cures cancer, I&rsquo;d use either. In the 
meantime, I will continue to argue that the very concept of 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine is a potentially deadly false dichotomy for 
cancer patients.</p>

<p>In Cassileth and Deng&rsquo;s 2004 review (
http://www.theoncologist.com/cgi/content/full/9/1/80), a few treatments come 
off as promising. For example, shark cartilage extract Neovastat (now 
disproven), polysaccharide K (approved in Japan, so arguably not CAM), and 
perhaps antineoplastons. The latest Cochrane review of laetrile actually stated 
that clinical trials are necessary, and there&rsquo;s allegations that Moertel 
used the relatively inactive isoamgydalin at far too low of doses, and gave up 
on intravenous (nontoxic) for oral (possibly toxic) far too quickly.</p> 
<p>Bizarrely, Cassileth and Deng don&rsquo;t mention perhaps the most 
promising CAM cancer treatment: melatonin. A recent meta-analysis found that 
melatonin &ldquo;reduced the risk of death at 1 yr (relative risk: 0.66, 95% 
confidence interval: 0.59-0.73, I2=0%, heterogeneity P&lt;or=0.56). Effects 
were consistent across melatonin dose, and type of cancer&rdquo;. This involved 
643 patients. No blinding, no placebo, 2/10 RCTs used intent to treat; most 
trials tested melatonin + treatment against only treatment. Admittedly, same 
research group for all the trials, which is suspicious. Still, it&rsquo;s a 
remarkable effect which should have brought major attention when the first 
trial was published in 1992. Incidentally, one of the coauthors, Seely, is a 
naturopath who published a very critical review of chelation therapy. 
He&rsquo;s the research director at the Canadian College of Naturopathic 
Medicine, and is now conducting a dbRCT on melatonin and cancer due to be 
completed in 2012. Have you never heard about the melatonin-cancer research?</p>
<p>The shallow reading of alternative cancer treatments displayed in this post 
(and even, strangely, in Cassileth&rsquo;s review), confirms an earlier 
statement I made in a comment that this blog has strong ideological rather than 
(or in addition to) scientific elements. There&rsquo;s little interest in 
sifting the wheat from the chaff and providing a balanced overview of medical 
science, including major problems in mainstream medicine. Ultimately this 
website preaches to the choir, and it&rsquo;s articles are typically obviously 
biased.</p> </li>

<p>@II:</p> 
<p>Sorry, but you are, well, imperfectly informed. Seely&rsquo;s chelation 
review is neither &ldquo;very critical&rdquo; nor competent. You probably 
don&rsquo;t know this because you haven&rsquo;t read the primary literature 
that it reviews. Nor, apparently, did Seely. I have: Kitchell&rsquo;s 1963 
report did not find &lsquo;chelation therapy&rsquo; to be beneficial, as Seely 
et al reported, nor was it even a controlled trial. Olszewer&rsquo;s 1990 
report, the other RCT that Seely et al called &ldquo;positive,&rdquo; was not 
credible. For a comprehensive discussion of these and other pertinent chelation 
articles, including highly touted case reports, look here:</p> 
<p>

</p> 
<p>For a discussion of the &ldquo;allegations&rdquo; about Moertel&rsquo;s 
Laetrile study, look at the report itself, the LTEs, and his response to them. 
What you&rsquo;ll find is advocates changing the rules midstream&ndash;typical 
for implausible claims. The Cochrane review calls for RCTs of Laetrile 
(bizarrely!) for a reason that I&rsquo;ve discussed several times here, but 
that I apparently need to do again: it conflates RCTs and the much broader 
realm of science. Look here:</p> 
<p>http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=83</p> 
<p>There you&rsquo;ll also find links to evidence against Laetrile that was 
compelling enough so that it should have &ldquo;closed the books&rdquo; even 
before Moertel&rsquo;s study. Look especially at the long report by FDA 
commissioner Donald Kennedy:</p>

<p>My first response to II, who does, as Kim so astutely put it, seem to be 
&ldquo;imperfectly informed,&rdquo; would be to ask why he/she considers 
melatonin to be in any way &ldquo;alternative.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s yet another 
example of how CAM coopts certain aspects of &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; 
medicine.</p> 
<p>In any case, it raises red flags that virtually all of the positive studies 
of melatonin as a breast cancer chemotherapeutic agent come from a single 
group, Lissoni et al. Here is how a rather good,very recent (2009) review on 
the subject described them:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Human trials of melatonin as a cancer chemotherapy agent, particularly 
those of Lissoni et al., have been reviewed in detail (Ref. 19). It is 
significant that when attempting a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 
studies examining melatonin as a chemotherapeutic agent, Mills et al. (Ref. 
103) were able to find only ten reports, all from the Lissoni group, that 
analysed melatonin definitively alone or in combination with standard 
therapies. All studies were performed on advanced cancer patients, were 
unblinded and did not include placebos. These reports included: three studies 
on lung cancer (one alone and two in conjunction with genotoxic chemotherapy, 
including cisplatin); one study each on breast cancer, renal cell cancer, 
glioblastoma and malignant melanoma; two studies of mixed populations of 
patients with either advanced or metastatic solid tumours; and one study 
specifically of brain metastases from assorted solid tumours. The average 
number of subjects in these studies was 75. The meta-analysis concludes that 
melatonin significantly reduced the risk of death of these patients at one year.
</p> 
<p>In a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of melatonin in 
solid-tumour cancer patients and on one-year survival, Mills et al. (Ref. 103) 
have shown that there is a positive benefit from the use of melatonin. These 
trials were all performed by the same group in the same hospital and are thus 
without independent confirmation from any other group; the results, although 
intriguing, are therefore difficult to assess. In addition, one year survival 
is very short term in the context of many cancers such as breast (with a mean 
recurrence time of seven years) and a much longer trial would need to be 
conducted. The most significant finding is that no adverse outcomes were 
reported from the use of melatonin. There seems to be very limited toxicity of 
this chemical in the context of what can be very toxic exposures during 
chemotherapy. This characteristic would make larger clinical trials of 
melatonin feasible.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>All of which are very reasonable conclusions. Independent verification is 
incredibly important. As an extreme example, I would point out that there are 
lots of antivaccine &ldquo;scientists&rdquo; out there who all claim to find an 
association between vaccines and autism that no other investigator who&rsquo;s 
looked at the question has been able to find. Could this be the case with 
melatonin and cancer therapy? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that I&rsquo;m 
always very skeptical about results that come from only one group of 
investigators. I will also note that I tend to cast an especially skeptical eye 
on any clinical trial done by the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, given 
how much CTCA promotes and supports woo in addition to standard therapy; i.e., 
&ldquo;integrative medicine.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>From the very meta-analysis that II cites, the authors cautioned:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are several limitations to be considered in the interpretation of our 
meta-analysis. Perhaps the most significant is that the same network of 
investigators in Italy and Poland conducted all 10 trials. While this will not 
necessarily bias the results, the lack of independent verification, 
particularly in the presence of an effect that is perhaps surprisingly large, 
warrants skepticism.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So, as far as melatonin goes, my retort to II would be that (1) melatonin 
as an anticancer therapy is not in any way &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; and (2) 
that the evidence for its efficacy is rather weak. Hopefully, future studies 
will answer the question.</p> 
<p>Now, regarding an &ldquo;ideological bias,&rdquo; we at SBM have one bias 
and one bias alone: We assert that medicine based on science is the best 
medicine for patients. We make this assertion based on what we consider strong 
and sound evidence. If any &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine can make the cut 
when subjected to scientific scrutiny, both in terms of evidence supporting its 
efficacy against disease and of a scientifically remotely plausible mechanism 
that can be studied, we will then consider it to be part of SBM. We do not 
apologize for this; differentiating science-based from non-science-based 
medicine is the<em>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</em> of this blog.</p>

<p>@Atwood:</p> 
<p>Indeed I didn&rsquo;t know about Kitchell, and I&rsquo;m chastened. 
However, that wouldn&rsquo;t have changed the negative conclusions of 
Seely&rsquo;s review, and somehow I find it hard to believe that both Lamas and 
Seely outright didn&rsquo;t read Kitchell, rather than simply interpreting it 
differently than you did. Nevertheless, if that is true, then it&rsquo;s a 
fairly heavy blow against them, and your description of it is fairly specific 
so I&rsquo;m inclined to believe you. I read the article previously, by the 
way, and added it as a reference in Wikipedia. Your article is so incriminating 
of Lamas that I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t filed some sort of case 
with the Office of Research Integrity. Considering that it is a BMC article, 
you should consider adding a comment.</p> 
<p>As far as laetrile, I don&rsquo;t have convenient NEJM access that far 
back, although I&rsquo;d love to see those issues. One obvious problem with 
your article is that it doesn&rsquo;t clarify that oral and not intravenous 
laetrile is generally (as far as I&rsquo;ve heard) considered toxic. The 1970s 
from the FDA commissioner is not compelling either, and similarly doesn&rsquo;t 
seem to make the toxicity clarification. That&rsquo;s evidence of bias, which 
you should try to avoid. Admittedly much of the altmed use may be oral.</p> 
<p> In Wade&rsquo;s 1977 article covering the early part of the controversy (
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17741690), it&rsquo;s clear that laetrile 
was assumed prior to testing to be ineffective. Mysteriously, their veteran 
researcher Kanematsu Sugiura found it effective in several animal experiments. 
If I recall correctly Wade says he wasn&rsquo;t able to distinguish when 
blinded, but it&rsquo;s still suspicious. Dean Burk&rsquo;s continued support 
of the therapy is similarly suspicious, and altogether it&rsquo;s enough to 
leave room for doubt that the therapy was properly tested.</p> 
<p>@Gorski:</p> 
<p>I consider melatonin &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; because, well, for one thing it 
would be at best &ldquo;complementary&rdquo;. For another, OTC dietary 
supplements and herbs, even ones with real pharmacological effects, are 
typically considered CAM, and receive greater attention from CAM people. 
I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a good thing, but it is a fact. It&rsquo;s 
partly the fault of mainstream medicine for dismissing these chemicals 
prematurely and preferentially using other more complicated, expensive 
chemicals. Really, though, the argument that melatonin is not CAM is fairly 
weak, especially since it was mentioned in your above post.</p> 
<p>As far as the single group, I mentioned that fact as suspicious in my 
comment, which apparently Gorski didn&rsquo;t notice. Still, I find it equally 
suspicious that nobody else has bothered to try to replicate the findings in 
all these years.</p> </li>

<li> # Calli Arcale <em>on 24 Mar 2009 at 10:21 am </em> 
<p>pec, why would it not be a good thing if CAM modalities were tested, 
proven, and then integrated into the mainstream? Would you rather they remain 
constantly on the fringe? If they are all as great as is claimed, 
wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that the majority would be deprived of the benefits of 
such therapies?</p> 
<p>ImperfectlyInformed:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s partly the fault of mainstream medicine for dismissing these 
chemicals prematurely and preferentially using other more complicated, 
expensive chemicals.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This isn&rsquo;t really reflective of the reality. The more complicated and 
expensive a drug is to manufacture, the narrower the profit margin will be. 
After all, there is an upper limit to what people are able to pay (with the 
exception of the very wealthy). This is part of why generics are so common 
(once patent protection expires). Part of the cost of a drug is its 
manufacturing costs, part is its material costs, and part is its development 
costs. A generic drug doesn&rsquo;t have to pay very much for development; they 
just have to apply with the FDA to get their version approved, which is much 
less onerous than proving that the stuff works as advertised in the first 
place. Basically, they just have to prove that it&rsquo;s functionally 
identical to the original drug and that their manufacturing methods pass muster.
</p> 
<p>So, if a drug is cheaper to make, this is actually to the drug 
company&rsquo;s benefit. Just look at Gardasil. People hold it up as an example 
of drug companies only wanting to sell expensive things, but its high price is 
a barrier to purchase which significantly limits their market share. Compare 
that with Airborne, a &ldquo;dietary supplement&rdquo; sold as a cold remedy 
(despite a lack of evidence), which is extremely cheap to make. Airborne is 
marked up considerably, but still people buy a lot of it. Certainly more than 
will buy Gardasil, and lots more doses per person. The profit margin for the 
overhyped multivitamin is much higher than for the elective vaccine, and the 
manufacturer could still lose their shirt over it if they can&rsquo;t recoup 
their research and development costs due to the high price.</p> 
<p>Complicated, expensive chemicals are not preferred by drug companies, 
because the higher costs make them riskier to market. But since most of the 
cheap ones have already been taken, they are usually forced to either compete 
in an existing market for a simple, cheap chemical (eg ibuprofen, where Advil 
and Motrin are engaged in all-out advertising war) or try to come up with 
something new where they won&rsquo;t have so much competition. So this drives 
them towards complicated, expensive chemicals anyway, which can give the 
impression that they somehow prefer selling things that are very expensive 
despite the lower profit margin that comes with that.</p> </li>

<p>Can you guys set it up so that any post where pec comments automatically 
gets tagged as &ldquo;humor&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>&ldquo;They do not want CAM treatments and ideas to be tested 
scientifically. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes, they are opposed to wasting precious, limited funds on highly 
implausible treatments, especially those that have already been tested 
scientifically and failed to show any difference from placebo. Should we test 
any treatment anybody invents? How about any treatment that anybody invents 
that enough people swear by? If I can invent a treatment and can convince half 
the members of the church of Scientology to use it, should the NCCAM spent 
millions of dollars to study it?</p> 
<p>(see http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=502 far a parallel outside 
medicine)</p> 
<p>They are also opposed to repeatedly running low quality pilot quality 
studies over and over again instead of following up with higher quality double 
blinded RCT&rsquo;s that can separate a signal form the noise.</p> 
<p>I feel comfortable in saying that if there was an &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; 
treatment with a plausible basis in science, or it the underlying basis for an 
apparently implausible treatment could be plausibly supported, and it had not 
already been properly tested, you wouldn&rsquo;t find any of the authors on 
this site opposing high quality testing of that treatment, and if those high 
quality trials showed it to be effective, the treatment would become part of 
scientific medicine, perhaps requiring a rewrite of our knowledge of science 
and medicine.</p> 
<p>The NCCAM has thrown a lot of money at &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; over the years, 
and it has yet to validate any of those implausible treatments, much to the

<li> # The Blind Watchmaker <em>on 24 Mar 2009 at 7:20 pm </em> 
<p>I think this discussion hinges on the definition of 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo;. If a good RCT shows that a treatment has utility, 
then it is medicine. If not, then it is &ldquo;not medicine&rdquo;. Untested 
things still have to be considered &ldquo;not medicine&rdquo; until utility is 
proven or at least highly suggested.</p> 
<p>Unconventional treatments are tested. Studies go from anecdotal reports, to 
preliminary studies, to stage one clinical trials and then on up to formal 
RCTs. If the &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; does not pass the early phases, 
plausibility is unlikely and it never makes it to formal RCTs. This is what the 
so-called &ldquo;Drug Pipelines&rdquo; are all about.</p> 
<p>A big problem with the SCAM world is that anecdotal reports and small 
preliminary-like studies are presented as actual, hard evidence. These studies 
are quoted to unsuspecting consumers.</p> 
<p>When organizations like NCAM perform real RCTs and find no value in 
whatever &ldquo;snake oil&rdquo;, the SCAM community condemns the findings (see 
all of the Sen Harkin related posts). 2+2 can&rsquo;t equal 5 even if a lot of

<p>There is medicine on the one hand and quackery on the other. The sCAM 
business is all about reintroducing quackery into the marketplace. The main 
goal of sCAM studies is marketing. It&rsquo;s the exact opposite of genuine 
medicine where the studies showing safety and efficacy are done before it ever 
comes to market. In sCAM the quack cures are sold all over and the corporations 
selling them are laughing all the way to the bank. They don&rsquo;t need to do 
any studies of safety and efficacy. That would be a waste of time and then you 
have to spend money denouncing the studies when they inevitably find that the 
treatments don&rsquo;t work.</p> </li>

<p>I think pec&rsquo;s response makes it fairly clear he/she considers urine 
injections to be absurd, since he/she responded with a statement about the 
absurdity of extremes. There was a good underlying point to the question, 
though &mdash; trying to show pec that it is worthwhile to pick and choose what 
to study based on prior plausibility. I&rsquo;m not sure pec&rsquo;s answer to 
the stated question would be all that useful; the point is simply that we can 
judge some things as being too absurd to waste resources on, and I think pec 
agrees.</p> 
<p>pec:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;why would it not be a good thing if CAM modalities were tested,

<p>My complaint was that Gorski is able to claim that there are no effective 
CAM treatments, because any that have been shown to be effective are now 
mainstream.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The point that Gorski (and others) has been trying to make is not that 
there are no effective CAM treatments but that the term &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; is 
useless, in part because it&rsquo;s so vague but mostly because 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; versus &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; is a false 
dichotomy. There should only be &ldquo;proven&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;unproven&rdquo;. The trend of late to divide medical therapies into 
&ldquo;conventional&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; really doesn&rsquo;t 
help the community. If something works, it should become mainstream so that 
everybody can benefit. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, or is surpassed by something 
else, it should be set aside so that people are not harmed by it.</p> 
<p>Are there no effective CAM treatments? Well, since they are all in the 
&ldquo;unproven&rdquo; category, we cannot say that there are any effective 
ones. This is not the same thing as saying that there are no effective ones, 
but it&rsquo;s really not much better. As long as this false dichotomy exists, 
I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope of &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; modalities ever being 
proven effective &mdash; or proven ineffective, for that matter.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Should we do an RCT of urine injection therapy for autism to see if

<p>I can&rsquo;t give you a simple yes or no answer, because it depends on 
what people have experienced with this therapy so far. When very large numbers 
of seemingly normal people swear by something, it warrants at least a casual 
investigation. If I were a medical researcher faced with this decision I would

<p>Unlike most &ldquo;skeptics,&rdquo; I do not believe that most people are

into elaborate and expensive formal research until I had seen some very good 
evidence in favor of the therapy.</p>

<p>1. A new hypothesis that contradicts established scientific understanding

<p>&ldquo;Methinks you realize the obvious trap you have fallen into&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any trap. I spent a little time with Google and found out 
that urine therapy is, and has been, widely practiced in many traditional 
cultures. That alone makes me curious about it &mdash; why do so many people 
feel that it does some kind of good? I also found that one woman in South 
America died from a urine injection. That alone would not make me dismiss it as 
dangerous, without knowing all the details of that particular case.</p> 
<p>Maybe there is a substance in urine that benefits the immune system in some 
way. I simply don&rsquo;t know, and if I were a medical researcher I might try 
to find out. I would see if any animal testing had been done, for one thing. I 
would read what I could find, and I might speak to some patients and 
practitioners who use it.</p> 
<p>As I said before, I would not jump to any uninformed conclusions.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Should we do an RCT of urine injection therapy for autism&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, I would definitely not start with an RCT, and most definitely not with 
human subjects. I think that was clear from my earlier answer.</p> </li>

<p>Jerry Andrus was an inventor of optical illusions. He showed that our 
assumptions are often wrong. For instance, he would take off his glasses and 
show that there was no glass in them; everyone had assumed they were real 
glasses but they were empty frames. People are easy to fool in many ways. But 
Jerry always said the reason he could fool people is not that they are fools 
but is because they have wonderful brains. Our brains have learned to take 
shortcuts and jump to conclusions because of the survival value. It is better 
to misinterpret shadows in the bushes as a lion than to miss a real lion. It 
would be a silly waste of our time to not assume that frames contain glass and 
to try to verify every instance. We can be more efficient by using such mental 
shortcuts, but occasionally they mislead us.</p> 
<p>I have the highest respect for people and their wonderful brains; I just 
recognize that because of the way our wonderful brains are constructed, we tend 
to make mistakes that can only be countered by science.</p> 
<p>Oh, and skeptics do not exempt themselves from human foolishness. We 
recognize that we can be fooled as easily as anyone else. Richard Feynman said, 
&ldquo;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself&ndash;and you are

<p>That&rsquo;s true. And there is no survival value in repeating a stupid 
medical mistake for thousands of years. People notice when something 
doesn&rsquo;t work. Of course certain treatments have been overused and 
sometimes dangerous. But the same is true of modern chemotherapy for cancer, 
for example.</p> 
<p>Medicine has always been and still is difficult and fallible. People use 
whatever they happen to have, and it&rsquo;s always very limited. The way you 
see it, there was nothing but superstitious nonsense before modern science.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I just recognize that because of the way our wonderful brains are

<p>You just feel you have to pretend to have respect for non-Western people.

<p>Science is just a formalization of the way people naturally think; it is 
not different from the normal logic and common sense that all people in all 
times have possessed.</p> 
<p>How do you think primitive hunter/gatherers learned what is ok to eat? They 
experimented. No the experiments aren&rsquo;t blinded and controlled, but 
they&rsquo;re still experiments and they still give valid results in the long 
run.</p> 
<p>You &ldquo;skeptics&rdquo; think the reason people make stupid mistakes is 
because they have not been educated into the scientific elite. You are wrong 
&mdash; people make stupid mistakes because the world is complicated and our 
data is limited.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how people do think in everyday life! Astrology

that things go crazy around the time of a full moon (it&rsquo;s been studied; 
there are, for example, no more ER visits on average around the time of a full 
moon than any other time). Athletes wouldn&rsquo;t refuse to shave or wear 
their &ldquo;lucky shirts&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re on a winning streak if that 
weren&rsquo;t the case. Selective memory, confirmation bias, and confusing 
correlation with causation<em>is</em> how people think. Such rapid 
&ldquo;jumping to conclusions&rdquo; probably had an evolutionary advantage 
because waiting for more information could be fatal, but it is a method of 
thinking that is very ill-suited for answering scientific questions regarding 
medicine.</p> 
<p>People confuse correlation with causation all the time, especially with 
questions of causation in medicine. Science is the answer. At best, anecdotal

<p>Yes because you are absolutely certain that every ancient 
&ldquo;superstition&rdquo; is complete nonsense you would say that. But you 
have, of course, missed the point. People do not make serious errors in 
practical matters because they lack conscious knowledge of the scientific 
method.</p> 
<p>If a member of a primitive tribe eats a mushroom and dies the other members 
might jump to the conclusion that the mushroom was poisonous. But someone might 
note that they have eaten the same mushroom and it was ok, so the death may 
have been a coincidence.</p> 
<p>You do not need any scientific training to do this kind of analysis &mdash; 
everyone does it every day. We could not survive otherwise.</p> 
<p>Confusions about causation also happen all the time, but they are in areas 
where we do not know the cause. The world is complex and very often, as the AI 
pioneers Simon and Newell described it, we have to &ldquo;satisfice.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Whenever evidence is clear and unambiguous people go along with it. When, 
as is often the case, there is no clear evidence, we do our best.</p> 
<p>Controlled scientific experiments have their place, but most of the time 
are not practical. Yet we are able to sort out cause and effect well enough to 
navigate complex everyday life.</p> 
<p>Our &ldquo;wonderful brains&rdquo; are very good at navigating this world. 
It is not the case that our brains constantly deceive us and lead us into grave 
errors.</p> 
<p>Yes we deceive ourselves all the time, but they are seldom self-destructive 
deceptions. We deceive ourselves in things we do know know and cannot know, 
accepting whichever answers we find most pleasant. But we do not, in general, 
fool ourselves into eating poisonous mushrooms.</p> 
<p>We are all scientists. All normal humans, including those who lack a 
Western education, are able to reason.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;skeptic&rdquo; movement believes they can improve the world and

<p>I actually have looked at the literature on urine therapy (such as I could 
find it, there wasn&rsquo;t that much when I looked). Books I have on it are:
</p> 
<p>Urine Therapy <i>Nature&rsquo;s elixir for good health</i> by 
Peschek-Bohmer and Scheiber<br>
 The Water of Life <i>A Treatise on Urine 
Therapy</i> by J. W. Armstrong<br>
 The Golden Fountain <i>The complete guide 
to urine therapy</i> by Coen van der Kroon<br>
 Ancient secret of the Fountain 
of Youth by Peter Kelder</p> 
<p>There is considerable woo in the idea of urine therapy (to be charitable  . 
I got it because of my interest in nitric oxide physiology, and because urine 
is a good source of urea, which I hypothesized that indigenous peoples in 
regions where other NO sources were unavailable might turn to.</p> 
<p>My fundamental NO hypothesis is that ammonia oxidizing bacteria on the skin 
oxidize ammonia in sweat into nitrite and NO, and this is important in setting 
the basal level of NO/NOx. NO/NOx physiology is pretty complicated and there is 
cross-talk with dietary nitrate which is most abundant in leafy green 
vegetables and which some have hypothesized is the reason that a diet rich in 
green leafy vegetables is associated with good health.</p> 
<p>When humans migrated out of Africa, they left the tropics and entered 
regions where it was not hot year round, where sweating was virtually absent 
for parts of the year. Many cultures developed the customs of wearing clothing 
so as to cause sweating (i.e. sweaters), or adopted the custom of sweat baths 
(i.e. sauna). In Tibet at high altitude, fuel was scarce, and also green leafy 
vegetables were not available year round. The terminal metabolite of NO is 
nitrate, and that is excreted in the urine, so urine is a source of nitrate as 
well as a source of urea (which becomes ammonia on hydrolysis).</p> 
<p>Topically applied urine might be able to substitute for exercise or thermal 
sweating provided one had the right biofilm of the bacteria I am studying. 
Ingesting urine might be able to substitute for ingesting nitrate in green 
leafy vegetables. The ancient practice of urine therapy did use both of these 
treatment modalities. I could find no mention of injection of urine (which I 
think would be a death wish).</p> 
<p>There are some folk practices that suggest that topical urine may cause 
increased NO/NOx. There is a folk remedy for impotence,<i>the golden shower</i>
, which might have a mechanism via NO/NOx (erections are mediated through NO 
physiology).</p> 
<p>It has been suggested that UTIs can be treated by ingesting nitrate (as in 
100 g of lettuce), allowing the nitrate to be excreted in the urine, allowing 
the bacteria causing the UTI to reduce that nitrate to nitrite (E. coli does 
this), and then acidifying the urine and ingesting vitamin C which facilitates 
reduction of nitrite to NO, producing acidified nitrite which is a broad 
spectrum antimicrobial.</p> 
<p>http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/47/12/3713</p> 
<p>When this author presented this work at a conference, I asked for his 
comment on how his NO/NOx results in urine might reflect on the effectiveness 
of a golden shower regarding UTI status. He was not prepared to speculate on 
that.</p> 
<p>Nitrite and NO also disrupts the biofilm phenotype of many bacteria, 
causing biofilms to disperse. This occurs at levels well below that necessary 
for bactericidal effects.</p> 
<p>In no way do I suggest that anyone use urine therapy for anything. There 
are far better ways of stimulating the growth of the bacteria I am working with 
to supply NO/NOx. The correct way to supply more NO is topically where it feeds 
into the natural physiological pathways that regulate it.</p> </li>

<p>The antivaccine movement is based on confusing correlation with causation 
in blaming autism on vaccines, for one.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s also a straw man to say that this is evidence of the 
&ldquo;idiocy&rdquo; of nonscientists. What it is is evidence that human 
beings, contrary to your claims, do frequently confuse correlation with 
causation and demonstrate all those other cognitive shortcomings we&rsquo;ve 
been discussing. Smart human beings do it too. Indeed, I sometimes think that 
the more intelligent among us are<em>more</em> prone to such thinking, at least 
with respect to medicine, simply because they believe that their intelligence 
is such that they would never be so easily misled by such cognitive 
shortcomings that appear to be hard-wired into the human brain. Indeed, when a 
person refuses to admit that he or she can be prone to such cognitive 
shortcomings, it&rsquo;s more a case of hubris than anything else.</p> 
<p>In fact, your labeling such shortcomings as &ldquo;idiocy&rdquo; says a lot 
about you. You seem completely unable to believe that all humans are prone to 
these sorts of cognitive shortcomings in every day life. Everyone is. You, me, 
Steve, everyone. And, yes, all those ancient peoples who thought bloodletting 
was a great cure for what ails you or that it&rsquo;s not possible for so many 
people to be so wrong for so many hundreds (or thousands) of years about 
something. (Astrology and ghosts come to mind as counterexamples.) Science is 
the way to prevent such cognitive quirks from leading to the wrong conclusion.

<p>pec, you don&rsquo;t understand. The topical use of urine might have 
therapeutic effects in &ldquo;the wild&rdquo; provided the proper biofilm is 
present. The modern use of urine therapy stresses sterility and prevention of 
any and all bacteria. Modern urine therapy likely has no beneficial effects and 
the current practitioners of it don&rsquo;t realize it.</p> 
<p>Modern urine therapy users adopted practices with no understanding of the 
physiology behind them, and then modified those practices to suit their 
aesthetic sensibilities with no understanding of the underlying physiology. 
They lost any physiological effects by changing what they did. All that remains 
is the placebo effect.</p> 
<p>This is what happens (in the words of the song) <i>When you believe in 
things that you don&rsquo;t understand you will suffer, Superstition 
ain&rsquo;t the way! Very superstitious, wash your face and hands</i></p> 
<p>The point that Dr Hall was trying to make, and which you agreed with, was 
that there needed to be some sort of a priori plausible physiology behind a 
treatment before going into clinical trials. You suggested you would try it in 
animals first (we shall ignore that there are no animal models of autism).</p> 
<p>In the case of blood letting, your approach was to find out if ancient 
people really did use blood letting, rather than try and figure out what 
physiology blood letting might influence. Try and rely on &ldquo;ancient 
wisdom&rdquo;, rather than modern understanding of the physiology involved.</p> 
<p>People have all sorts of biases. Ancient people had the bias that they 
didn&rsquo;t know about physiology, bacteria, metabolism, and a zillion other 
things. Modern people have the bias that they don&rsquo;t know those things 
either and would rather listen to an ignorant charismatic fraud than a 
non-charismatic knowledgeable nerd. Ancient people are no different than modern 
people. They listened to ignorant charismatic frauds too because there was no 
one knowledgeable to listen too.</p>

believe that their intelligence is such that they would never be so easily 
misled by such cognitive shortcomings that appear to be hard-wired into the 
human brain.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes, I sometimes think the most educated high-IQ types tend to make the 
most serious errors, because they have so much confidence in their own 
thinking. Consider the the complex mathematical models that helped cause the 
financial crisis, for example.</p> 
<p>But you are very steadfast in missing my point. I keep saying we are ALL 
limited and fallible. But it&rsquo;s NOT because of a lack of scientific 
eduction. It&rsquo;s because we just do not know, and cannot know, very much.
</p> 
<p>Yes I know we deceive ourselves, as I already said, but not because we 
aren&rsquo;t scientific enough. If it were possible to be perfectly scientific, 
it would still not be possible to know the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; because we never 
have enough data. We have to &ldquo;satisfice.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>[I can tell you that &ldquo;non-western&rdquo; folk are just like us. They

<p>In the context of the discussion it should have been obvious what I meant 
by non-Western. I had been talking about traditional cultures and the practice 
of folk medicine, as opposed to modern Western medicine. I was saying that 
traditional people who do not have a Western scientific education are 
nevertheless capable of being reasonable and making scientific observations.</p>

<p>&rdquo; possible for so many people to be so wrong for so many hundreds (or 
thousands) of years about something. (Astrology and ghosts come to mind as 
counterexamples.)&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes that is always your ultimate &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that traditional 
people are capable of fooling themselves endlessly. Ghosts can&rsquo;t possibly 
exist, but all kinds of people have been seeing them everywhere. I don&rsquo;t 
want to veer off into an argument about astrology or ghosts. But I wonder if 
you could try to imagine that maybe your certainty might contain a trace of 
self-deception?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;You suggested you would try it in animals first (we shall ignore 
that there are no animal models of autism).&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I DID NOT suggest that. I said that IF I found good reasons to suspect it 
might have some benefit, I would FIRST try it on animals to find out if 
it&rsquo;s safe. I KNOW there are no autistic animals! Jeez.</p> </li>

<p>I must say, I am not a fan of the false dichotomy of &ldquo;western&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;non-western&rdquo;. As someone who I suppose straddles the line, 
having an asian parent, and who lived in asia for a while, I can tell you that 
&ldquo;non-western&rdquo; folk are just like us. They are us. We are them. They 
have no particular viewpoints that render them either superior or inferior. You 
can find as much silliness and intelligence in &ldquo;non-westerns&rdquo; as 
you can here. Just saying.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Agree 100%. In fact, I view it as condescending to Asians to hold remedies 
that originate from the &ldquo;East&rdquo; to a lower standard of evidence than 
those that originated from the &ldquo;West.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>What would you consider to be good reasons to suspect urine might have some 
benefit in this situation?</p> </li> 
<li> # weing <em>on 29 Mar 2009 at 11:27 am </em> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of using urine for wound irrigation in the wilderness. In 
the middle ages urine was used as a mouth wash. I&rsquo;ve also read about the 
Chichimeca indians drinking the urine of their chief after he consumed a 
hallucinogenic mushroom in order to experience hallucinations.</p> </li>

 The point that you seem to be 
missing here is that the scientific method came about to compensate for those 
recognized human vulnerabilities.<br>
 And though we may not know very much in 
comparison to all that the universe is, we still know a hell of a lot ! Just 
take a look around you. Take, for example the computer that you use, it 
represents tremendous amounts of known science. How about the entire space 
program, a modern automobile, and yes, modern medicine.<br>
 I suggest that you 
take off your postmodern blinders, and join the real world. Come on in, the 
reality is fine.</p> </li>

<p>pec said &ldquo;I have studied more than one thing in my life. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>Fail.</p> 
<p>studying != learning</p> 
<p>You seem to be of either the open mind where too much has fallen out, or 
too closed minded to actually learn about the subject under discussion.</p> 
<p>And to repeat what tmac57 said: &ldquo;I suggest that you take off your 
postmodern blinders, and join the real world. Come on in, the reality is 
fine.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>I have stated many times at this blog that I am not against modern science, 
not at all. I am interested in science and technology and that&rsquo;s why I 
studied them. What I am against is pseudo-skepticism and dogmatic materialism, 
which are not scientific.</p> 
<p>I am a skeptic and I do not make up my mind about things just because I 
follow a certain ideology. I think science is great and that the dogmatic 
pseudo-skeptics only block its progress.</p> </li>
