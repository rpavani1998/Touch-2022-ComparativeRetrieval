<p> <b>Note</b>: This monograph does not focus on evidence where physical 
therapy was used in combination with drugs, such as pain killers.</p> </li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Background</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>According to the American Physical Therapy Association, the goal of 
physical therapy (PT) or physiotherapy is to improve mobility, restore 
function, reduce pain, and prevent further injury by using a variety of 
methods, including exercises, stretches, traction, electrical stimulation, and 
massage. Special tools are used, such as hot or cold packs, crutches, braces, 
treadmills, prosthetics, compression vests, computer-assisted feedback, lasers, 
and ultrasound. Patients range in age from newborns to the elderly.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Physical therapy was first documented in China around 3000 BC with the use 
of joint manipulation and massage to relieve pain. The ancient Greek doctor 
Hippocrates wrote about massage and hydrotherapy in 460 BC, and splints and 
exercises were used to treat wounded Roman gladiators. The modern discipline of 
physical therapy emerged to treat soldiers wounded in World War II.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Physical therapy is commonly used for musculoskeletal injuries, joint pain 
or disorders, low back pain, cerebral palsy, and rehabilitation after injury or 
surgery, including heart surgery or mastectomy. Physical therapy, especially 
early physical therapy, can be painful, and many patients use medications for 
pain during therapy.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>In the United States, all states require physical therapists to graduate 
from an accredited physical therapy program and pass a licensing exam before 
they practice. A physical therapy program includes supervised clinical 
experience and coursework in biology, chemistry, anatomy, and therapeutic 
techniques. Physical therapists work in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, 
schools, sports facilities, and patients' homes. Patients may be referred to a 
physical therapist by a doctor or may directly contact a physical therapist.</p>
</li> </ul> 
<h2>Tradition/Theory</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Physical therapy is tailored to the patient's condition and health issues. 
A common goal of physical therapy is to increase how the patient functions at 
home and at work.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Various types of physical therapy address specific problems. 
Musculoskeletal physical therapy uses massage and joint movement to increase 
strength, motor control, and flexibility. Cardiopulmonary physical therapy 
treats lung and heart conditions, such as cerebral palsy, asthma, and 
post-heart attack rehabilitation, by clearing the lungs of mucus, ventilating 
the lungs to ease breathing, or exercising to increase a patient's ability to 
move. Neurological physical therapy works to restore balance, coordination, and 
motor function through repeated exercises for patients with spinal injury, 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain and nerve disorders. 
Integumentary physical therapy uses wound cleaning, scar prevention, and scar 
reduction to help patients with wounds, burns, and other skin-related problems.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>At the first visit, a physical therapist reviews medical records, examines 
the patient, and talks with the patient. Physical therapists may spend up to 
25% of a visit speaking or listening to a patient to identify current and 
potential problems. Depending on the patient's health, abilities, and goals, 
the physical therapist outlines a treatment plan, including the anticipated 
outcomes and a timetable for reaching goals. The physical therapist may also 
conduct tests to establish a baseline, to see how much the patient improves 
during therapy. The patient may be instructed on exercises to do at home.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>The American Physical Therapists Association recommends that a patient feel 
comfortable asking the physical therapist any questions about expectations and 
the proposed plan of care.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>According to some studies, patients may not follow a physical therapist's 
instructions for at-home exercises or other interventions, such as shoe 
inserts. Although not following instructions may be due to illness or disease, 
not following instructions may slow or reduce progress.</p> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Scientific Evidence</h2> 
<p> <strong>Uses</strong> </p> 
<p> These uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and effectiveness 
have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, 
and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider.</p> 
<p>Grade*</p> <br>

<p> <em> Incontinence </em> </p> 
<p> A variety of techniques have been used to improve incontinence (loss of 
urinary control), such as pelvic-floor neuromuscular electrostimulation 
combined with exercises, pelvic floor muscle exercises alone (Kegel exercises), 
vaginal cones, and vaginal balls. Outcome measures studied have included 
bladder volume, vaginal palpation, and perceptions of improvement. Overall, 
short-term improvements have been seen with pelvic floor exercises and vaginal 
balls. Physical therapy appeared more effective than biofeedback techniques 
based on one trial. Physical therapy has been shown to be an effective 
treatment for dysfunctional voiding in children. Higher-quality trials and 
comparisons with placebo are needed to confirm these results.</p> 
<p> <strong>B</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Knee osteoarthritis </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee may provide short-term 
benefits, but long-term benefits do not appear better than standard treatments. 
Physical therapy, either as an individually delivered treatment or in a small 
group format, appears effective. Only one available study compared physical 
therapy to a sham group (subtherapeutic ultrasound) and found that a 
combination of manual physical therapy and supervised exercise was beneficial 
for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. One method of physical therapy, 
infrared, short-wave diathermy-pulsed patterns and interferential therapy, 
showed more effectiveness than intra-articular hyaluronan drugs in two studies. 
One successful exercise program used a sling suspension system. More study 
using consistent treatment protocols and outcomes measures would be helpful.</p>
<p> <strong>B</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Pain </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat a wide variety of pain syndromes 
including patellofemoral pain syndrome, wrist pain, post-operative pain, and 
chronic pain. Pain associated with athletic injuries, such as groin pain, are 
often treated with physical therapy. Despite some mixed evidence, there are 
several trials that compare physical therapy techniques to placebo controls for 
the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome that have found beneficial 
effects. Also, continuous low-level heat wrap therapy may be helpful in common 
conditions causing wrist pain and impairment. Long-term studies with more 
standardized outcomes measures would help make a stronger recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>B</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Whiplash </em> </p> 
<p> There is emerging evidence that physical therapy may be beneficial for 
reducing the time to heal following whiplash injury. Studies have found benefit 
of physical therapy and active exercises over standard of care. According to 
one study, manipulative treatment may shorten recovery time faster than 
physiotherapy treatment. Higher-quality trials with control groups would help 
make a stronger recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>B</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Achilles tendonitis </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy (crutches, orthoses, and eccentric exercise training) has 
been used in the management of pain for Achilles tendinopathy and tendon 
ruptures. Results are unclear. More study is needed to drawn any firm 
conclusions.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia </em> </p> 
<p> Based on limited study, the combined use of physical therapy plus a home 
exercise program may be beneficial in children with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia. Stretching, strengthening, and aerobic exercise may improve ankle 
dorsiflexion active range of motion and knee extension strength. More study is 
warranted.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Ankylosing spondylitis </em> </p> 
<p> Several clinical trials have compared supervised group physical therapy to 
unsupervised daily exercises at home for the treatment of ankylosing 
spondylitis. Further well designed studies are needed before a firm 
recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Asthma </em> </p> 
<p> Chest physical therapy and physiotherapy breathing retraining have been 
studied in both children and adults to improve quality of life and improve lung 
function in severe and acute asthma. Early evidence is mixed. Studies often 
include combination treatment with drug therapy or are not well-designed, which 
make it difficult to assess the magnitude of benefit, if any, of physical 
therapy alone. More research is warranted.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Back pain </em> </p> 
<p> Despite the large amount of research conducted on physical therapy 
cost-effectiveness and treatments for back pain (including chronic and acute 
low back pain, lumbar disc herniation, pregnancy-related back pain, 
work-related back pain), there is a lack of conclusive evidence that physical 
therapy is more effective than other treatments or placebo. Examples of 
specific techniques used include home-based exercise programs, mobilization and 
extension techniques, flexion exercise, breathing therapy, Masai barefoot 
technology, and the McKenzie method. There are questions in the literature as 
to whether physical therapy regimens should be tailored to fit the individual's 
back pain, as not all back pain is alike.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Bone density </em> </p> 
<p> Supervised or home-based physical therapy has been used in combination 
with resistance and endurance training in physically frail elderly women taking 
hormone replacement therapy to improve bone density. Long-term high-intensity 
weight-bearing exercise programs have also been used in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients with some success. In premature infants, improvements were seen in 
weight gain, growth, bone mineral content, bone mineral density, bone area, and 
bone mass following physical therapy. Although early study is promising, more 
studies are needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Brain injury </em> </p> 
<p> Patients with chronic traumatic brain injury often have gait (movement) 
disorders. Physical therapy techniques such as treadmill training and 
weight-bearing gait training have been used with mixed results.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Breast cancer </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy programs are often used following mastectomy (breast 
cancer surgery). These may include arm mobilization, shoulder strengthening, 
prevention and treatment of upper extremity edema, and education about arm 
function. One study suggested that immediate postoperative physical therapy may 
increase shoulder range of motion, but more high quality trials are needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Bronchitis (chronic) </em> </p> 
<p> Respiratory therapy has been used in the treatment of bronchitis, and the 
FLUTTER device has been studied for its beneficial effects. Results are unclear 
and additional research is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Cardiovascular conditions </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been studied to improve peak oxygen consumption, work 
rate, general cardiovascular health, and distance walked during six minutes. In 
particular, physical therapy has been used to treat coronary syndrome X 
(syndrome X), which is a chronic pain disorder with exercise-induced chest 
pain. Early evidence is promising, but additional study is needed to make a 
firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Carpal tunnel syndrome </em> </p> 
<p> Carpal bone mobilization and median nerve mobilization have both been 
studied for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Based on one study, no 
significant differences were found between treatments or compared with control 
groups. More study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Cerebral palsy </em> </p> 
<p> Children with cerebral palsy are frequently referred for physical therapy, 
yet the effectiveness of treatment has not been well-documented. Numerous 
physical therapy techniques have been used to treat movement/motor disorders 
associated with cerebral palsy, including hippotherapy (physical therapy 
utilizing the movement of a horse), sensory-perceptual-motor training, 
neurodevelopmental physical therapy, and functional physical therapy. 
Conservative physical therapy regimens have also been used in combination with 
electrical stimulation, infant stimulation, botulinum toxin A, and selective 
dorsal rhizotomy. Results are inconclusive.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) </em> </p> 
<p> There may be a beneficial effect of respiratory rehabilitation in terms of 
improved tolerance to exercise and improved quality of life for COPD patients. 
Studies have investigated the use of physical therapy with drugs, as well as 
the difference between manual and mechanical techniques; few studies have 
compared respiratory physiotherapy to control groups. Examples of manual 
respiratory physical therapy techniques include postural drainage, chest 
percussion, vibration, chest shaking, directed coughing, or forced exhalation 
technique. Higher-quality trials are needed to make a firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Chronic prostatitis </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence in this area. Additional studies are needed 
before a recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence in this area. Additional studies are needed 
before a recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Circulatory disorders </em> </p> 
<p> Various types of supervised and unsupervised physical therapy programs 
such as compression, cold-temperature stimuli, gymnastics, walking, and sauna 
have been used to improve circulation in the legs. Early evidence suggests 
small benefits when physical therapy is used in combination with drugs. More 
study is needed to make any firm conclusion.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Complex regional pain syndrome </em> </p> 
<p> Complex regional pain syndrome involves persistent pain, allodynia (light 
touch causing pain), and vasomotor signs. Early evidence suggests that physical 
therapy may have a better effect than occupational therapy or no treatment for 
the reduction of pain in some patients. Physical therapy, especially home-based 
programs, may also be more cost-effective. Additional research is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Congestion </em> </p> 
<p> Both manual and mechanical respiratory physiotherapies have been studied 
in cystic fibrosis and lobectomy patients. Results are mixed and it is unclear 
whether certain physical therapy shows benefits over standard drug therapy 
alone or over placebo treatments. More evidence is needed to clarify these 
findings.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Cystic fibrosis </em> </p> 
<p> Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting the mucus lining of the 
lungs, leading to breathing problems and other difficulties. Chest physical 
therapy (postural drainage, percussion, and vibration) may be used to clear 
bronchial secretions, as well as mechanical devices, such as the Flutter valve. 
However, well-designed studies that compare physical therapy to placebo or 
other interventions are lacking. Additional research is needed in this area.</p>
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Down's syndrome </em> </p> 
<p> Based on early study, orofacial physical therapy may be beneficial in 
treating oral motor function, facial expression, the occurrence of 
malocclusions, and hypertrophic tonsils in Down's syndrome children. In 
addition to physical therapy, treadmills have also been used to help reduce the 
delay in walking onset in infants. Sensory integrative therapy, vestibular 
stimulation, and neurodevelopmental therapy are other techniques studied. Due 
to the various methods studied across trials, comparison is difficult and a 
firm conclusion cannot be reached at this time.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Facial palsy </em> </p> 
<p> Facial palsy is commonly treated by physical therapy with various 
therapeutic strategies and devices. There is conflicting evidence of 
significant benefit or harm from physical therapy treatments for this condition.
</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Fall prevention </em> </p> 
<p> Early study of individually tailored programs of physical therapy in the 
home appears promising for the reduction of falls in elderly women. More study 
is warranted in this area before a stronger recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Fatigue </em> </p> 
<p> There is inconclusive evidence on whether physical therapy may help reduce 
cancer-related fatigue. Additional study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Fibromyalgia </em> </p> 
<p> Early research indicates that a self-management based program of pool 
exercises and education may improve the quality of life of patients with 
fibromyalgia and their satisfaction with treatment. In one study, physical 
therapy did not show better effects when compared with hypnotherapy. 
Better-designed trials are needed to make a firm conclusion.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Fractures </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been primarily studied as a method of shortening the 
duration of healing time following cast immobilization of fractures. 
Additionally, a supervised physical therapy program has been used in children 
with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder in which bones are abnormally 
fragile and may fracture easily. Physical therapy in this population may 
improve aerobic capacity and muscle force and reduce fatigue. Overall, however, 
the evidence is still mixed and more study is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Frozen shoulder </em> </p> 
<p> Intensive physical rehabilitation treatment, including passive stretching 
and manual mobilization (stretching group), has been compared with supportive 
therapy and exercises within the pain limits for the treatment of frozen 
shoulder. Results are inconclusive and more study is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Guillain-Barre syndrome </em> </p> 
<p> There is limited study of physical therapy for the treatment of 
Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a self-limiting autoimmune disorder that causes 
neuromuscular deficits. Further research is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Headache </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat chronic headache, migraines, 
tension-type headaches, and cervicogenic headaches. Available studies have used 
combination treatments of standard physical therapy in addition to 
psychotherapy, medications, or adjusting dental occlusion. Better-designed 
trials of PT alone are needed before it can be recommended.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Heart failure </em> </p> 
<p> Both supervised and home-based exercise training can enhance exercise 
capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. However, there is no consensus 
regarding a rehabilitation program for these patients and the literature often 
suggests individually-tailored programs. Due to the lack of standardization, 
duration of treatment, and various outcomes measures, more study is needed 
before a firm recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Hip fractures </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy appears beneficial as a method of shortening the duration 
of healing time from hip fracture recovery after surgery, improving quality of 
life, or as preparation for hip replacement surgery in the elderly. Home-based 
programs, gait retraining programs, high vs. low-intensity programs, early vs. 
late interventions, and multicomponent rehabilitation have all been studied 
with mixed results.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Hip pain </em> </p> 
<p> There is little available research on the physical therapy treatment of 
hip pain. Mobilization and manipulation techniques have been studied. More 
research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Hypertension (high blood pressure) </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient available evidence in this area. Additional research 
is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Joint problems </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat a variety of joint problems, 
including chronic ankle instability, clubfoot (a birth defect of the 
ankle/foot), impingement syndrome, and knee, thumb, elbow, shoulder, wrist, and 
ankle movement disorders. Most studies stress early intervention to speed 
recovery, although studies that compare early intervention to later 
intervention, spontaneous healing, and other modalities, including sham 
treatments, are lacking. Better-designed trials are needed before a firm 
recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Joint problems (rotator cuff, SIJD) </em> </p> 
<p> Several studies have used physical therapy techniques plus passive motion 
to improve function, reduce pain, and improve muscle strength and range of 
motion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) and rotator cuff repair. Both 
video-tape and personal instruction approaches have been studied with no 
apparent differences in results. Additional high-quality studies are needed in 
this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Kashin-beck osteoarthropathy </em> </p> 
<p> Early evidence shows that physical therapy may be better than 
multivitamins for treating Kashin-beck osteoarthropathy, although results are 
unclear. Additional evidence is needed to make a firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Knee pain (rehabilitation) </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy programs such as independent home exercise, supervised 
exercise, and open and closed kinetic chain exercises have been studied for 
their effect on decreasing recovery time following anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL) reconstruction or traumatic dislocation of the knee. Although studies 
indicate that some kind of rehabilitation and movement are beneficial, the sum 
of the evidence does not favor physical therapy over traditional home therapy 
or other treatments. Additional study is warranted.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Knee replacement surgery </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat complications and/or help with 
recovery after knee replacement surgery. Examples of treatments used include 
knee braces, shoe lifts, custom-fitted shoe inserts, electrical stimulation, 
peroneal nerve releases, and Botox&reg; injections. Instruction in kneeling is 
a useful addition to physical therapy following knee replacement. Additional 
study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Lung function </em> </p> 
<p> There is inconclusive evidence in this area. Additional study is warranted.
</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Lymphedema </em> </p> 
<p> Various types of physical therapy have been employed in the treatment of 
lymphedema, such as complex physical therapy (CPT), self home maintenance 
therapy (bandage/wearing of elastic garment and exercise), and pneumatic 
compression. No high-quality trials show benefit of these therapies over other 
therapies or controls. Physical therapy has also been used in combination with 
sodium selenite application. Additional study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Multiple sclerosis (MS) </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
with PT. Additional research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Muscle atrophy </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence for the treatment of muscle atrophy with 
PT. Additional research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Muscle spasticity </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence showing physical therapy's effect 
(specifically, ultrasound techniques) on reducing muscle spasticity. Additional 
research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Muscle tension </em> </p> 
<p> There is conflicting evidence regarding physical therapy's ability to 
lengthen hamstring muscles or increase hamstring flexibility. Additional 
research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Musculoskeletal conditions </em> </p> 
<p> There is not enough evidence to support the role of physical therapy for 
the treatment of meralgia paresthetica (a musculosketetal condition). Physical 
therapy has also been suggested as a possible treatment for a genetic disorder 
called multiple pterygium syndrome (MPS). Additional research is needed in this 
area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Myofascial pain (TMJ) </em> </p> 
<p> There do not appear to be any distinguishing effects on myofascial pain, 
tempromandibular disorders (TMJ), or function impairment in the available 
literature between arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis, and physical therapy. 
Most studies using physical therapy use it in combination with educational 
instruction. Additional study is needed to make a firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Neck and shoulder pain </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been studied for various neck and shoulder pains, 
shoulder dysfunction, adhesive capsulitis, quadriplegic shoulder pain, acute 
neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, cervico-brachial pain syndrome, and shoulder 
impingement syndrome among other conditions. Techniques studied in combination 
with conservative physical therapy include gymnastics, strengthening exercises, 
electrotherapy, thermotherapy, massage, cervical traction, and tissue 
mobilization. It has been proposed that modified manipulative therapy regimens 
are more effective than traditional physiotherapy in reducing pain and 
increasing function in many of these conditions. Some studies have found 
short-term benefits of manual therapy over general medical care. Physical 
therapy has been compared with acupressure, the Feldenkrais method, and drug 
interventions although it is still unclear whether physical therapy is better 
or worse than short-term spontaneous healing or long-term healing. More 
high-quality studies are needed before a firm recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Nerve disorders </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient available evidence. Physical therapy has been 
combined with music therapy to treat children with Erb's palsy. However, 
additional study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Nerve pain </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat diabetic nerve pain and 
chemotherapy-induced nerve pain. There is not enough scientific evidence to 
make a firm recommendation for this use.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Neurological disorders </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence in this area. Additional studies are needed.
</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Orthostatic hypotension </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence in this area. Additional studies are needed.
</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Osteoarthritis </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used in the treatment of gonarthritis and hand, 
hip, and knee osteoarthritis. Manual therapy has sometimes shown better 
outcomes on pain, stiffness, hip function, and range of motion, although it is 
unclear whether sham treatment or other modalities would be comparable to 
physical therapy. Additional study is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Parkinson's disease </em> </p> 
<p> Management of Parkinson's disease typically aims to obtain symptom 
control, reduce clinical disability, and improve quality of life. In addition 
to medications, physical therapy aims to improve balance, postural control, 
walking, and to reduce falls. Physical therapy techniques may have short-term 
benefits, but the available evidence is unclear. One meta-analysis indicated 
that physical therapy is beneficial when used in combination with medications, 
but the effects of physical therapy alone are unknown. Additional high-quality 
studies are needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Peripheral artery disease </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient evidence available in this specific area. Additional 
study is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Plantar fasciitis </em> </p> 
<p> There is good evidence that low-intensity laser irradiation, a widespread 
but controversial physical therapy agent, is not an effective treatment of 
plantar fasciitis when compared with sham laser treatment for plantar 
fasciitis. Other therapies such as extracorporeal shockwave treatment have been 
studied, but low-quality study designs prevent a strong recommendation from 
being made. Additional information is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Pneumonia </em> </p> 
<p> Early evidence suggests that chest physiotherapy techniques such as 
postural drainage, external help with breathing, percussion, and vibration are 
not better that receiving advice of deep breathing instructions in the 
treatment of pneumonia. Additional evidence is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Pregnancy problems (pelvic girdle pain) </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy with a focus on specific stabilizing exercises may be 
more effective than a regimen without specific stabilizing exercises in the 
treatment of pelvic girdle pain, functional status, and quality of life. Based 
on one study, there were no differences between giving patients information, 
doing at home physical therapy, or in-clinic physical therapy. Additional 
higher-quality research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Pulmonary conditions </em> </p> 
<p> Lung hyperinflation is a technique used by physiotherapists to mobilize 
and remove excess lung secretions, reinflate areas of pulmonary collapse, and 
improve oxygenation. Studies have compared manual vs. mechanical interventions 
and found no differences between the two. However, studies are lacking that 
compare physical therapy to placebo or other interventions. Additional research 
is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Quality of life </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient available evidence in this specific area. Additional 
studies are needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Rehabilitation (cardiac) </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used during cardiac rehabilitation with or 
without beta-blocker medication. More research is needed in this area to draw a 
firm conclusion.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Rehabilitation (geriatric) </em> </p> 
<p> One-on-one physical therapy has been compared to structured social visits 
for geriatric rehabilitation. Home-based physical therapy programs have also 
found modest benefits in walking, bathing, upper- and lower-body dressing, 
transferring from a chair, using the toilet, eating, and grooming in elderly 
patients. Early evidence does not show a strong benefit of physical therapy. 
More studies are needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Rehabilitation (vestibular) </em> </p> 
<p> Patients with chronic vestibular disorders typically have complaints of 
unsteadiness, imbalance, and/or motion intolerance. Various types of 
rehabilitation have been tried, although vestibular rehabilitation, a specific 
approach to physical therapy aimed at reducing dizziness and imbalance by 
facilitating central nervous system compensation for peripheral vestibular 
dysfunction, has been used the most. Results are generally positive, but more 
well-designed studies are needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Rheumatoid arthritis </em> </p> 
<p> Several studies have indicated that treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
should be conducted by a specially trained physical therapist and that physical 
therapy may help improve morning stiffness and grip strength. A long-term 
high-intensity exercise program has been suggested by some, and beneficial 
effects may last up to one year. Despite promising early evidence, 
better-designed studies are needed to draw a firm conclusion.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Sciatica </em> </p> 
<p> There is not enough available evidence. Additional study is needed in this 
area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Skin ulcers </em> </p> 
<p> Early evidence suggests that high voltage stimulation or pulsed electrical 
stimulation may speed the healing of some types of skin ulcers. More research 
with similar outcomes measures is needed to confirm these findings.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Spine problems </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient available evidence supporting a role for physical 
therapy in improving spinal mobility, treating chronic spine disorders, or in 
treating myelomeningocele. Additional study is needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Sprains and strains </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been studied to reduce the healing time of acute 
ankle ligament sprains and acute hamstring sprains. Certain aspects of physical 
therapy, such as progressive agility, trunk stabilization exercises, and icing, 
may be more beneficial than static stretching, but results are unclear. More 
large studies of higher-quality are needed.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Strength enhancer </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used with biofeedback training to enhance 
strength in patients with foot drop (a birth disorder where the foot is twisted 
out of shape or position), and has also been used in elderly patients 
recuperating from acute illnesses. Well-designed studies are needed before a 
recommendation can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Stroke </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy is a popular choice for patients undergoing stroke 
rehabilitation. It aims to strengthen weakened muscle groups through repetitive 
motion, increase overall function including cognitive function, and improve 
gait and walking. Available studies have used a variety of exercises, which 
makes it nearly impossible to compare the evidence. Furthermore, physical 
therapy is often used as a control group in these studies and rarely do studies 
find a significant difference between physical therapy and other interventions. 
Higher quality studies are needed to make a firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Surgical recovery </em> </p> 
<p> Many studies have shown that when physical therapy is used before or 
immediately after a long period of immobilization, such as bed rest associated 
with hospitalization, the result is a shorter overall hospital stay with fewer 
complications. Physical therapy techniques are often used following 
cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, abdominal surgery, and other surgical 
procedures, as well as for the prevention of pulmonary complications. Several 
studies do not show any difference between various chest physiotherapy 
treatments, such as incentive spirometry, intermittent positive pressure 
breathing (IPPB), or deep breathing exercises. Overall, it is difficult to 
compare treatment outcomes across the various studies.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Tendonopathies (tendon dysfunctions) </em> </p> 
<p> Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is a relatively common problem of 
middle-aged adults that usually is treated operatively. One study suggested 
that early stages of tendonopathies could be effectively treated nonoperatively 
with an orthosis and structured exercises. Aside from orthosis, exercise, 
stretching, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be of use for tendonitis 
of the shoulder. Additional research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Tennis elbow </em> </p> 
<p> Lateral epicondylitis (commonly known as tennis elbow) is one of the most 
common upper extremity pain syndromes. Compared with corticosteroid injections, 
physical therapy appears less effective for treating tennis elbow, but studies 
are mixed and a firm recommendation cannot be made at this time. Physical 
therapy techniques such as cold pack use, progressive strengthening, or 
stretching exercises may be helpful for reducing the recurrence of symptoms. 
Studies using extracorporeal shock wave therapy or low-frequency electrical 
stimulation found conflicting results.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Thyroiditis </em> </p> 
<p> There is insufficient available information on physical therapy as a 
treatment for thyroiditis. Additional study is needed before a recommendation 
can be made.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Tinnitus </em> </p> 
<p> There is limited study on the effects of physical therapy in tinnitus. One 
study found that acupuncture showed more benefit on reducing the severity of 
tinnitus and improving quality of life than physical therapy. More study is 
needed in this area.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Vertigo </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy has been used to treat vertigo (specifically, benign 
paroxysmal positional vertigo). Physical therapy protocols are not well 
outlined, and there is limited study comparing physical therapy vs. other 
modalities. Nevertheless, physical therapy may be helpful for vertigo but more 
study is needed to make a firm recommendation.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Wound care </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy techniques such as laser treatment have been used to 
clean and heal wounds. More research is necessary prior to physical therapy 
being recommended for this use.</p> 
<p> <strong>C</strong> </p> <br>

<p> <em> Low birth weight </em> </p> 
<p> Physical therapy does not appear to help motor performance in infants born 
very preterm with very low birth weight. Besides the lack of benefit, available 
studies show a risk of causing fractures in preterm infants.</p>

<p> Los profesionales de la salud que tienen instrucci&oacute;n formal 
practican muchas t&eacute;cnicas complementarias, de acuerdo con los 
est&aacute;ndares de organizaciones nacionales. No obstante, este no es el caso

<li> 
<p>Physical therapy techniques have been used in adults, children, and the 
elderly for a wide variety of conditions. Due to the many kinds of techniques 
used by physical therapists and multiple conditions treated, this section only 
provides selected examples of adverse effects and is not a comprehensive list. 
Due to malpractice concerns, it is possible that not all adverse effects have 
been reported in the available literature.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Not all physical therapy programs are suited for everyone, and patients 
should discuss their medical history with a qualified healthcare professional 
before beginning any treatments. Based on the available literature, physical 
therapy appears generally safe when practiced by a qualified physical 
therapist. However, complications are possible. Treatment options should be 
considered carefully. Based on one large study, there were no reported adverse 
events resulting from the physical therapists' diagnoses or management during a 
40-month period.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>There is considerable study investigating whether physical therapy should 
be initiated immediately or following a waiting period. For example, patients 
who return to physical therapy after a deep vein thrombosis are more likely to 
develop a pulmonary embolism than patients who return later (no sooner than 48 
to 72 hours). In contrast, it is thought that keeping areas immobilized for 
long periods of time may also carry risk factors.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Physical therapy is often used in patients recovering from surgery whose 
postoperative pain may be severe. This can complicate early physical therapy. 
Pain medications may be given, which in turn may carry risk factors for 
anti-inflammatory-drug- or aspirin-induced gastrointestinal complications. 
However, physical therapy interventions may alter absorption and distribution 
of drugs that are administered transdermally (through the skin), subcutaneously 
(under the skin), or intramuscularly (injected into the muscle). Medication 
adjustments may be necessary.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Physical therapy may aggravate pre-existing conditions. Persistent pain and 
fractures of unknown origin have been reported. Physical therapy may increase 
the duration of pain or cause limitation of motion. Pain and anxiety may occur 
during the rehabilitation of patients with burns. Both morning stiffness and 
bone erosion have been reported in the physical therapy literature although 
causality is unclear. Erectile dysfunction has also been reported.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Chest physical therapy, among other kinds of physical therapy, may increase 
metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood pressure. Repetitive 
exercises can have cardiovascular effects. A patient's cardiac and pulmonary 
risk factors should be assessed to determine whether heart rate and blood 
pressure should be monitored. Moreover, the physical therapy method of 
inversion (placing the heart above the head) may increase blood pressure (both 
systolic and diastolic). Caution is advised when using inversion as a treatment 
technique for low back pain. Patients with high blood pressure may need to 
avoid this technique.</p> </li>

<p>In some very low birth weight premature infants and young children, 
physical therapy techniques, such as passive motion and chest percussion 
therapy, may increase the likelihood of bone fractures.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>In the elderly, walking backwards during physical therapy has resulted in 
falls and considerable morbidity. Safety precautions are advised when 
performing challenging tasks in populations with risk factors.</p> </li>

<p>Hemophilia A patients may have a greater bleeding risk after blood 
transfusion when physical therapy is started within eight hours of a blood 
transfusion.</p> </li>

<p>Physical therapy has been used in pregnancy, specifically to treat women 
with pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy, and at three, six, and 12 months 
postpartum. Reports of major adverse effects are lacking in the available 
literature, but caution is advised nonetheless. All therapies during pregnancy 
and breastfeeding should be discussed with a licensed obstetrician/gynecologist 
before initiation.</p> </li> </ul>
