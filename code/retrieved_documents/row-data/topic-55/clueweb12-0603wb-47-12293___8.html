<p><strong>What is Arthritis?</strong></p> 
<p>There are many type of arthritis, a condition that primarily causes 
inflammation, pain and limited mobility in the joints. Symptoms ofarthritis are 
caused by a breakdown of cartilage surrounding the joint, which normally acts 
like a shock absorber and prevents bones from rubbing together. Some types of 
arthritis are a result of regular or excessive wear and tear on the joints and 
cartilage surrounding the joints, while others are a result of metabolic or 
immune system abnormalities, infections or injury. Each type of arthritis has 
slightly different symptoms, causes and treatments.</p> 
<p><strong>What causes Arthritis?</strong></p> 
<p>Causes of arthritis are based on the type of arthritis an individual 
suffers from. Osteoarthritis, for example, is a result of wear and tear on the 
cartilage around joints or can arise after sustaining an injury. Gout, another 
form of arthritis, is a metabolic condition. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by 
an overactive immune system. Other types of arthritis may be caused by 
infections, injury or other medical or physical conditions.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the symptoms of Arthritis?</strong></p> 
<p>There are numerous types of arthritis and each has slightly different 
symptoms. Osteoarthritis is characterized primarily by joint pain and stiffness 
during regular activities. Rheumatoidarthritis symptoms include pain, 
inflammation, swelling, and stiffness that occur in the same joints on both 
sides of the body. Some types of arthritis primarily cause pain with activity 
while others cause pain upon waking or all the time. In addition to pain, 
swelling and stiffness, other symptoms of arthritis may include tenderness, 
redness or warmth around the joint, limited joint function, and deformity. 
Certain forms of arthritis also cause problems in other areas of the body in 
addition to where the pain presents itself.</p> 
<p><strong>How is Arthritis diagnosed?</strong></p> 
<p>A medical professional will take a complete medical history and will 
perform a physical exam. Examination of the joints will occur, looking for 
swelling, tenderness, redness, pain with movement, deformity, and joint 
mobility (range of motion). X-rays are also often taken of the affected joints 
and the amount of joint fluid can also be tested by removing a small amount of 
fluid with a needle. If a type ofarthritis other than osteoarthritis is 
suspected, blood and urine analyses may be ordered.</p> 
<p><strong>When should I seek care for Arthritis?</strong></p> 
<p>If you experience pain, swelling, irritation and limited mobility in your 
joints that does not go away after a few short days of rest, it is best to see 
a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis. Since there are many forms ofarthritis, 
getting an early diagnosis will help to determine the best course of treatment 
and the most successful outcome. If pain or swelling is sudden or severe, you 
cannot move the affected joint, the joint is red or warm to the touch, or you 
experience fever or chills, immediate medical attention is recommended.</p> 
<p><strong>What will the treatment for Arthritis consist of?</strong></p> 
<p>Treatment for arthritis depends on the type of arthritis an individual is 
afflicted with, as well as the severity of the symptoms and which joints are 
affected. Most treatments are aimed at reducing pain, swelling, stiffness, and 
disability and cannot cure the condition. Treatments may include heat and cold 
therapy, physical therapy exercises, lifestyle and diet changes, 
anti-inflammatory medications, splinting, and rest. Exercise is an important 
component of most arthritis treatment and should include strength training, 
exercises to increase flexibility and range of motion, and low impact aerobic 
activity. Some types of arthritis require additional treatments, such as 
additional medications, water therapy, transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS), 
injections of joint fluid, and as a last resort, joint replacement surgery.</p> 
<p><strong>Which muscle groups/ joints are commonly affected by Arthritis?
</strong></p> 
<p>Arthritis can affect almost any joint in the body, including those in the 
hips, neck, back, shoulder, elbow, fingers, wrists, knees, and ankles.</p> 
<p><strong>What type of results should I expect from the treatment of 
Arthritis?</strong></p> 
<p>Treatment of arthritis will vary by the type of arthritis and results will 
vary as well. Most forms of arthritis are chronic and the goal of treatment is 
to diminish pain, swelling and inflammation and restore normal range of motion 
in the joint. Some forms of arthritis can be completely cured. In some cases, 
treatment will be successful but will need to be periodically repeated as new 
flare-ups occur. Diagnosing and treating arthritis early can prevent permanent 
joint damage from occurring. Surgery to replace affected joints is generally 
successful if followed by proper rehabilitation.</p>

 There are many 
causes of back pain, and unfortunately most adults will experience back pain at 
some point in their lives. &nbsp;The type of pain experienced, as well as the 
duration and severity of the pain, will differ depending on the cause, as well 
as the individual. &nbsp; Although there is no complete cure for most causes of 
back pain, there are definite ways to reduce pain, improve mobility and 
flexibility, and avoid the ill-effects caused by prolonged pain and disability. 
<br>  At NYSM, we offer non-surgical options for effectively and safely 
managing back pain. &nbsp;Dr. Michael Neely is experienced in the treatment of 
back pain and customizes treatment programs with the aim of getting patients 
back to the level of activity and type of lifestyle they are accustomed to 
&ndash; without being sidelined by acute or chronic pain.  We offer a number of 
treatment options to improve or eliminate the effects caused by back pain, no 
matter what the cause. &nbsp;In addition to non-surgical medical treatments 
performed by Dr. Neely, NYSM also offers one of the most effective and proven 
ways to improve back pain &ndash; physical therapy. &nbsp; Supervised exercise 
and strengthening through a comprehensive physical therapy program is one of 
the best ways to control back pain and diminish the effects of any disability 
caused by the pain. &nbsp;Our experienced physical therapy staff works 
one-on-one with patients, providing the greatest chance for a successful 
outcome.  &nbsp;  Surgery should always be a last resort option for the 
treatment of back pain. &nbsp; It carries with it numerous risks, a long 
recovery time, and even the chance that surgery is not successful. 
&nbsp;Chiropractic care is another option, but is not helpful for all people or 
all types of back pain. &nbsp;Even for those that do benefit from chiropractic 
care, repeated trips to the chiropractor are required in order to maintain a 
pain-free state and therefore it is not a good long-term solution. 
&nbsp;Self-management of back pain, on the other hand, is a safe and proven 
long-term approach to controlling the effects of back pain.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  
NYSM&rsquo;s approach to treating back pain begins with a thorough medical 
evaluation. &nbsp;We address the cause of the pain, how long it has been going 
on, what makes it better or worse, and how the pain affects the patient&rsquo;s 
daily activities. &nbsp;We also take into account each individual 
patient&rsquo;s goals, limitations and concerns before devising a customized 
treatment plan. &nbsp;We offer a variety of cutting-edge non-surgical treatment 
options to relieve and manage pain. &nbsp;We also devise comprehensive plans 
that allow patients to self-manage their pain, under our initial guidance. 
&nbsp;This provides immediate relief, as well as a long-term approach to living 
a life as free from back pain as possible.  &nbsp;  Some causes of back pain 
that can be treated at NYSM include: 
<ul> 
<li>Arthritis</li> 
<li>Degenerative Disc Disease</li> 
<li>Muscle Spasm</li> 
<li>Nerve Impingement (Radiculopathy)</li> 
<li>Piriformis Syndrome</li> 
<li>Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction</li> 
<li>Sciatica</li> 
<li>Scoliosis</li> 
<li>Spondylolisthesis</li> 
<li>Thoracic or Lumbar Sprain or Strain</li> </ul>  If you have tried any type 
of treatment for back pain, including chiropractic care, and have seen no 
improvement after two weeks, it is time to find another approach that will 
work. &nbsp;At NYSM, we are dedicated to helping our patients diminish or 
eliminate pain, while avoiding surgery. &nbsp;Through a combination of 
cutting-edge treatments, as well as a focus on strengthening the body through a 
structured physical therapy program, we can provide you with the tools you need 
to effectively manage back pain so you can get on with living the life that you 
love.
