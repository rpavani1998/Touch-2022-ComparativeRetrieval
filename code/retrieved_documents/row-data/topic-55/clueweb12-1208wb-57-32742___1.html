<h1>Laser Therapy</h1> 
<p> High Power Laser Therapy has already helped thousands of people get 
long-term relief without drugs, needles, side effects, pain or surgery. In 
clinical studies patients receiving Laser Therapy have experienced a 
significant reduction in pain. There have been world-wide research efforts 
undertaken to better understand the many therapeutic benefits of Laser Therapy. 
In fact, a recent review of over 2500 articles in the medical literature 
indicated that many acute and chronic conditions may be improved or eliminated 
with therapeutic lasers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Laser Light Therapy is used by St. Tereiza Physical Therapy as an effective 
treatment for numerous acute and chronic pain. The application of light therapy 
is used for soft tissue repair and regeneration. Low level lasers send cold 
light through skin layers to soft tissue cells to stimulate blood flow and cell 
metabolism. The laser light directs biostimulative energy to the body's injured 
cells in a specific location where the cells transform this energy into 
chemical energy promoting natural healing and pain relief through tissue repair.
</p> 
<p>St. Tereiza Physical Therapy has had great success at treating all of the 
previously mentioned pains. Laser Light Therapy has shown promising results and 
only takes a couple sessions to feel the difference!</p> 
<h2>What is Laser or Light Therapy?</h2> 
<p>Low-level and LED therapy or &quot;photobiomodulation&quot; is the use of 
specific wavelengths of light (red and near infrared) to create therapeutic 
effects. These effects include improved healing time, pain reduction, increased 
circulation and decreased swelling. The light may be provided by a low-power 
laser or LED (light emitting diode).</p> 
<h2>Has effectiveness been demonstrated scientifically?</h2> 
<p>Yes. There are thousands of published studies demonstrating the clinical 
effectiveness of laser therapy. Among these there are more than one hundred 
rigorously controlled scientific studies that document the effectiveness of 
laser for many clinical conditions.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <br>
<br>

<p>Click the questions below for the answers.</p> 
<h5>Does it hurt? What does a treatment feel like?</h5> 
<p>There is little or no sensation during treatment. Occasionally one feels a 
mild, soothing warmth, or tingling.</p> 
<h5>Are there any side effects or associated risks?</h5> 
<p>During more than twenty years of use by health care providers all over the 
world, very few side effects have ever been reported. If a patient is allergic 
to light then they may get a rash or blister for a few days. Occasionally some 
old injuries or pain syndromes may feel aggravated for a few days, as the 
healing response is more active after treatment.</p> 
<h5>How long does each treatment take?</h5> 
<p>The typical course of treatment is five minutes depending on the size of 
the area being treated.</p> 
<h5>How often should a patient be treated? </h5> 
<p>Acute conditions may be treated daily, particularly if they are accompanied 
by significant pain. More chronic problems respond better when treatments are 
received 2 to 3 times per week tapering to once a week or once every other 
week, with improvement.</p> 
<h5>How many treatments does it take?</h5> 
<p>This depends on the nature of the condition being treated. For some acute 
conditions 1-6 treatments may be sufficient. Those of a more chronic nature may 
require 10-15 (or more) treatments. Conditions such as severe arthritis may 
require ongoing periodic care to control pain.</p> 
<h5>How long before the results are felt?</h5> 
<p>You may feel improvement in your condition (usually pain reduction) after 
the very first treatment. Sometimes you will not feel improvement for a number 
of treatments. Each treatment is cumulative and results are often felt after 3 
or 4 sessions.</p> 
<h5>Can it be used in conjunction with other forms of treatment?</h5> 
<p>Yes, Laser Treatment is often used with other forms of therapy, including 
physical therapy, massage, soft tissue mobilization, electrotherapy and 
following surgery. Other healing modalities are complementary and can be used 
with laser to increase the effectiveness of the treatment.</p> <br>
