throughout the city of Chicago and beyond.</li> 
<li>We believe in <strong>teaching our patients techniques to become as 
self-reliant as possible</strong> and do not encourage over-dependence on the 
doctor. While some of our patients with chronic, recurring conditions choose to 
receive ongoing care, most of our patients recover within several weeks or 
months.</li> 
<li><strong>You will not be subjected to any unnecessary tests or procedures.
</strong> We do not take routine X-rays of every patient with back pain that 
comes in to see us. We will order additional diagnostic studies (lab tests, 
X-rays, MRI, CT scan, etc.) from the best facilities in Chicago, if there is a 
legitimate reason to do so.</li> 
<li>You will receive <strong>friendly, professional, efficient, and 
personalized service</strong>. When you call during business hours, you will be 
greeted by either our office manager or our chiropractic assistant, and not a 
computerized &quot;phone tree&quot;.</li> 
<li>Although most patients receive traditional manual (&quot;hands-on&quot;) 
adjustments,<strong>we also offer &quot;low force&quot; adjustments, preformed 
with a highly advanced instrument</strong>. Some patients are familiar with 
these instrument adjustment techniques, which are often referred to as 
&quot;activator&quot;, &quot;pro-adjustor&quot;, or &quot;impulse 
adjusting&quot;.<strong>These low-force adjustments are extremely gentle and 
precise.</strong> Experience has shown us that instrument adjusting can be 
especially effective when used in combination with manual adjusting. In other 
instances, instrument adjusting may be used as an alternative to manual 
adjusting. As with all of our treatment options, the doctor will be happy to 
discuss with you which adjusting techniques would be best for your particular 
condition.</li> 
<li><strong>We accept insurance</strong>, including most PPO and HMO plans. We 
will file your insurance claims for you electronically and await payment from 
your insurance company.</li> 
<li><strong>You will not be kept waiting to see the doctor.</strong> We 
respect our patients' schedules, do not double-book appointments, and we 
actually run on time.</li> 
<li>Your <strong>phone calls will be returned promptly</strong>. Most phone 
calls and e-mails to the doctors are returned within a few hours, and all 
within 24 hours.</li> 
<li>We have <strong>evening and weekend hours</strong>.</li> 
<li>We offer <strong>free, valet parking</strong> in the parking lot adjacent

<h2>PROGRESSIVE HEALTH &amp; WELLNESS BLOG:</h2> <b>HOW ACUPUNCTURE WORKS</b> 
: Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have been in 
existence for over 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how acupuncture works 
has been largely based on theory. The basic theory is outlined in a text from 
200 B.C. It acknowledges in people and nature a vital energy or life force 
known as Qi (pronounced &quot;chee&quot;). Qi flows through the body via 
channels called meridians. If the Qi flow is altered, the resulting deficiency, 
excess, or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction, illness, and inability 
to heal properly. Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific 
points along these meridians, restores the proper Qi flow, thereby returning 
the body to a state of improved health and decreased pain.Chiropractic doctors 
and other licensed practitioners administer about 10 million acupuncture 
treatments each year in the US, most commonly for pain control, sports 
injuries, and smoking cessation. As the popularity of acupuncture increases, 
researchers have become more interested into proving exactly how acupuncture 
works.<br>
<br>
 To date, researchers have been able to measure an increased 
flow of acupuncture-induced endorphins. This explains the pain-relieving effect 
of acupuncture. Also, functional MRI's have measured changes in the activity of 
key centers of the brain, where pain is interpreted, when certain acupuncture 
points are treated. There are other beneficial effects of acupuncture also 
being researched, including the treatment of: nausea, asthma, sinus conditions, 
colds and the immune system, and other internal disorders. Furthermore, 
acupuncture has been observed clinically to enhance healing, and provide 
long-lasting pain relief.<br>
