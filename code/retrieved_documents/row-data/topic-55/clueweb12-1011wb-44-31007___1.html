<p>Chiropractic Myth </p> 
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Dear Dr. Harvey, <br>
 I have been considering 
going to a chiropractor for some time now. I've been having a lot of low back 
pain and have tried painkillers, physical therapy and massage. Yet I have not 
received any relief. I would like to start, but have heard that once you start 
going to a chiropractor you have to keep going the rest of your life, is this 
true?</p> 
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong><br>
</strong>Not a week goes by that I am 
not asked this question in my practice. It is what I refer to as a 
&quot;chiropractic myth.&quot; There are many misconceptions about chiropractic 
care, and this is a very common one. A similar concern is that if you get 
adjusted a lot, your spine will become &quot;loose&quot; and then you will 
always need care. Or that too many adjustments will give you arthritis in your 
spine. None of these &quot;myths&quot; are true and none of them have any 
research to substantiate them.</p> 
<p>As to your original question - I believe that you should go to a 
chiropractor your whole life, but that has to be your choice. Let me explain in 
more detail.</p> 
<p>In my clinic we do a great deal of education which includes videos, 
handouts, report of findings and various lectures, to name a few. We find that 
the educated patient makes a better patient and always gets better results! 
Remember, the word doctor means teacher.</p> 
<p>We educate our patients so that they can make educated decisions in regards 
to their health care and their health care goals.</p> 
<p>A very important thing to understand about chiropractic is that there are 
three main types of care.</p> 
<p>Acute or crisis care - to relieve a specific pain or symptom, such as low 
back pain. This type of care may only take a few visits or it may take weeks or 
even months. It depends on the severity of the condition, the age of the 
patient, how long the problem has been there, and numerous other factors.</p> 
<p>Reconstructive care - to restore the normal alignment of the spine. The 
goal in reconstructive care is to get the structure of the spine to function at 
its maximum with the least amount of pressure on the nervous system. This type 
of care may take months or even years. A good analogy of this type of care is 
to compare it to braces on teeth, which may take two to five years.</p> 
<p>Maintenance care or wellness care - the goal here is once we have the spine 
in the best possible shape, now we should maintain that maximum function for 
the rest of your life? Absolutely, yes!<br>
 Many of our patients have 
difficult health care goals. Our job is to educate you so that you make the 
choice that is right for you. Then we respect that decision. If your goal is to 
simply get out of pain and come in only when it hurts - fine. If your goal is 
lifetime care for you and your family to keep their nervous systems functioning 
at their maximum - great.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, you only have to keep going to a chiropractor for a long 
time if it is your choice. Some people take vitamins their whole life or 
exercise their whole life. It is a matter of personal choice. I have chosen 
lifetime care for myself and my family and we are healthier because of it.</p>

family. If you have any questions please go to Ask the Doctor and send in your
