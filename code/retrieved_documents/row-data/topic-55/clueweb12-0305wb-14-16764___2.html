<p>You hear that you're supposed to stay active through your chronic pain and 
you think&mdash;'But how? Most activities make my pain worse! Sometimes, just 
getting through the day at work is agony, and now the doctor expects me to do 
extra activities after work?' This is where a physical therapist can help. He 
or she can give you a personalized strengthening and exercise plan, in addition 
to helping you learn how to manage your &quot;daily life&quot; pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapy is Personalized </strong><br>
 Chronic pain comes 
in many forms, so effectively treating<i>your </i>pain requires a plan<i> just 
for you</i>. The physical therapist will do a detailed physical evaluation to 
assess your chronic pain and its effect on your life. He or she will also ask 
about your treatment goals: do you want to learn how to better manage your pain 
at the office? Are you eager to start exercising but feel your pain is limiting 
that? What would be most helpful to learn in physical therapy?</p> 
<p>Using that information, the physical therapist will develop a therapy plan 
for you.</p>  You may be interested in these related articles:

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapy is Passive and Active </strong><br>
 Physical 
therapy includes both passive and active treatments. Passive treatments help to 
relax you and your body. They're called passive because you don't have to 
actively participate.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Your physical therapy program may start with passive treatments, but the 
goal is to get into active treatments. These are therapeutic exercises that 
strengthen your body and help you deal with the chronic pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Passive physical therapy treatments include: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Deep Tissue Massage:</strong> This technique targets spasms and 
chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress. You 
could also have spasms or muscle tension because of strains or sprains. The 
therapist uses direct pressure and friction to try to release the tension in 
your soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles).</li> 
<li><strong>Hot and Cold Therapies: </strong>Your physical therapist will 
alternate between hot and cold therapies. By using heat, the physical therapist 
seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood flow 
brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to remove 
waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing.<br>
<br>
 
Cold therapy, also called cryotherapy, slows circulation, helping to reduce 
inflammation, muscle spasms, and pain. You may have a cold pack placed upon the 
target area, or even be given an ice massage. Another cryotherapy option is a 
spray called fluoromethane that cools the tissues. After cold therapy, your 
therapist may work with you to stretch the affected muscles.</li> 
<li><strong>TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation):</strong> A 
TENS machine stimulates your muscles through variable (but safe) intensities of 
electrical current. TENS helps reduce muscle spasms, and it may increase your 
body's production of endorphins, your natural pain killers. The TENS equipment 
your physical therapist uses is relatively large. However, a smaller machine 
for &quot;at home&quot; use is also available. Whether large or small, a TENS 
unit can be a helpful therapy.</li> 
<li><strong>Ultrasound: </strong>By increasing blood circulation, an 
ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, cramping, swelling, stiffness, and pain. 
It does this by sending sound waves deep into your muscle tissues, creating a 
gentle heat that enhances circulation and healing.</li> </ul> 
<p>Passive therapies, such as those listed above, are generally done in 
conjunction with active therapies.<strong>In the active part of physical 
therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your 
flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your 
joints move).</strong></p> 
<p><i>Remember:</i> Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking 
into consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable 
for another person with chronic pain, especially since chronic pain is such a 
subjective, personal experience.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Aspects of Physical Therapy </strong><br>
 If needed, you 
will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate ergonomic principles 
into your daily activities. This is all part of the &quot;self-care&quot; or 
&quot;self-treatment&quot; aspect of physical therapy: through physical 
therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take better 
care of your body.</p> 
<p>Your physical therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program 
for you. As you can read in theExercise and Chronic Pain article, staying 
active is an important part of chronic pain treatment. The physical therapist 
can help you figure out the best type of exercise for you.</p>  Updated on:
