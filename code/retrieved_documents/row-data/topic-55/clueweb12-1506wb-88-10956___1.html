<h3>Testimonials</h3> 
<p>Dear Bernie,</p> 
<p>I am pleased to report the very high praise you received from Carole 
Gerbovaz. She could not stop talking about your dedication, your attention to 
detail and the excellent care you provide her as her physical therapist.</p> 
<p>I want to thankyou very much for providing such superlative care and I plan 
to refer more patients who may need your services in the near future.</p> 
<p>Please accept my compliments.</p>

<p>Dear Newbury Park Physical Therapy,</p> 
<p>I want to take this time to thank you for getting my legs back is shape so 
I can once again run marathons and other road races. A couple of years ago my 
right leg became injured and I spent over a year in and out of other physical 
therapy offices, doctor and chiropractic offices with no relief in sight. It 
wasn't until I ventured into your office and had your excellent staff work on 
my legs that they were able to feel normal again. Since finishing my last 
physical therapy treatment at your office, I have dropped my race per mile pace 
back down below 7 minutes and will me running a 24 hour relay race around Lake 
Tahoe this coming June.</p> 
<p>When asked by my friends at work as to what organization helped me back to 
running, I always tell them about my great experience at Newbury Park Physical 
Therapy and how much you helped me out.</p> 
<p>Thanks again for getting me back to running.</p>

Marathon Runner from Camarillo, CA</p> 
<p>When I first came to Newbury Park Physical Therapy two months ago, I was 
constantly in pain from arthritis and inactive because of my fears of 
reinjuring my back after two recent surgeries. Alicia Swan has been a 
phenomenal help and blessing to me, working not only on getting my joints and 
muscles moving again, but perhaps even more so in rebuilding my confidence and 
changing my mindset about reinjuring my lower back. The benefits were 
immediately felt, and I have seen steady and, to my mind at least, remarkable 
progress since then. Alicia has been amazing in building up a program for me 
and graciously supportive through all of it. To me, it has been life altering. 
I feel better than I have in several years, and, while not pain free, I now 
know what to do about it and how to keep that beast in its proper cage. In 
addition to Alicia, the entire staff were supportive and friendly. I would 
highly recommend any of them to you, these people know what they are doing.</p>

<p>Bernardine, words alone can not fully express the tremendous gratitude I 
have for both you and the entire staff at Newbury Park Physical Therapy in 
getting me back into shape after not ONE but TWO total hip replacement 
operations (both sides) last year. I have been and remain able to do damn near 
anything I want to do and could do before my arthritis forced my replacements. 
I bike, ski and play table tennis as well or better than before. My weight is 
slightly higher, but my waist size remains the same, indicating to me increased 
muscle mass in my legs and upper body, thanks to the exercises you showed me at 
the gym.</p> 
<p>I must mention the staff at NPPT, as they are such an excellent team. 
Everyone of them is always smiling, always willing to help any therapist or 
patient at any time and always looking for something to do to be helpful, 
either to a patient or to the upkeep of the facility. This attribute was 
noticeable from day one. Being recognized and addressed by name from the moment 
you first walk in the door till your last goodbye made NPPT a very special 
place.</p> 
<p>Alan Friedman</p> 
<p>&quot;Please send my special thanks to Rich Heinz and all assistants in 
your office.</p> 
<p>When I came to your office for my neck pain, I was very worried and 
confused. No one, including my surgeon, could tell me what went wrong and why 
my neck pain came back after about one year of my operation. Rich helped me not 
only build my muscle strength to reduce the pain, but also to have the 
confidence of my recovery. His knowledge and expertise made my treatments very 
successful.</p> 
<p>All other people in the office were very friendly. They made us, the 
patients, feel at home in your clinic.</p> 
<p>Thank you all, I really appreciated the help I got from you and will 
recommend your place to others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a runner. After visiting Newbury Park Physical Therapy, my 
ankles were more flexible and my feet felt they had more range of motion. After 
recovering from a foot injury, I am now a better runner than before. The 
therapists make you feel right at home and show a genuine concern for getting 
you better.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;My knee pain is gone, I'm sleeping again and the quality of my life 
is greatly improved. Thank you Sue for your expertise and professionalism.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Jeanne C.</p> 
<p>&quot;Very good experience! Professional, courteous, and focused on getting 
me better in the most appropriate way.&quot;</p> 
<p>Carl Adams</p> 
<p>&quot;Excellent rehab and strengthening program, no more ankle pain when I 
run. Thank you NPPT, keep up the good work.&quot;</p> 
<p>Tyler Sebastian</p> 
<p>&quot;Excellent care every visit. Helped me regain full use of my hand. 
Increased mobility, decreased pain, goals achieved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Within five minutes Alicia determined the cause of my severe neck and 
back spasms that had eluded proper treatment for years. She greatly decreased 
my pain immediately and provided exercises that have kept the spasms from 
recurring. I have full confidence in all of the NPPT therapists; they seem to 
have a deeper understanding.&quot;</p> 
<p>Vicki Thon</p> 
<p>&quot;Denis was able to free my body in a way no one else could. I now 
function with more comfort, ease, and grace than I have had in years. I am 
forever indebted to his magical hands.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ruth Fisher</p> 
<p>&quot;NPPT provides the highest standard of service performed by the best 
therapists and support staff possible. It was such a gift being relieved of my 
shoulder and back pain. I am forever grateful to Rich and the NPPT staff.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Angela Hoogland</p> 
<p>&quot;I attribute my recovery to the excellent care and attention Rich and 
the talented support staff have provided. I have progressed from wheelchair to 
walker to cane. I am totally satisfied with my experience at NPPT. I highly 
recommend NPPT to my family and friends.&quot;</p>
