<p>Can your spine be &ldquo;out&rdquo;? Can it be &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo;? 
Adjusting the spine (spinal manipulative therapy, orSMT) is complex and 
controversial, largely based on the chiropractic concept of a joint 
&ldquo;subluxation.&rdquo; SMT for the back probably has modest benefits and 
tolerable risks, while SMT for necks involves less benefit &hellip; and the 
rare but real risks of paralysis and death! Nearly all medical science experts 
and many chiropractors reject the century-old chiropractic belief that SMT can 
prevent or cure diseases. This article covers these topics thoroughly &mdash; 
it is one the most detailed online guides that I know of. I particularly 
discuss the pros and cons of SMT as it relates to the treatment ofneck pain, 
back pain, and muscle pain.</p> 
<h4>Recommended reading</h4> 
<p>This article is inspired and informed particularly by the work of Dr. 
Samuel Homola, a chiropractor, and I quote him extensively. He covers this 
topic brilliantly in his 2006 article&ldquo;Can Chiropractors and 
Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work Together?&rdquo; Dr. Homola manages to be 
precise and thorough without losing his amiable tone -- exactly what I aim for 
on this website, actually. The article isavailable for free at this address. 
It&rsquo;s a bit heavy going for patients, but it&rsquo;s worthwhile for anyone 
who&rsquo;s really keen to understand this subject. Another excellent online 
introduction to Dr. Homola&rsquo;s writings is his recent article for 
ScienceBasedMedicine.org,Chiropractic Vertebral Subluxations.</p> ZOOM <br>
<br>
<p>I also strongly recommend Dr. Homola&rsquo;s 1998 book for health care 
consumers,Inside Chiropractic: A Patient&rsquo;s Guide.</p> 
<h3>Overview of a messy topic</h3> 
<p>The idea of &ldquo;adjusting&rdquo; the spine refers to many different 
manual therapies. The joints of the spine may be wiggled, popped, stretched, 
tapped and more. The correct umbrella term for these treatments is 
&ldquo;spinal manipulative therapy&rdquo; or SMT. Expert opinions on SMT range 
widely, with some prominent doctors and medical scientists expressing the 
strongest possible concern and skepticism. Its origins in chiropractic are 
dubious, its benefits are not major, and there are serious risks, including 
paralysis and even death.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;there is a &ldquo;paucity of data related to beneficial effects of 
chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine&rdquo; and a &ldquo;real 
potential for catastrophic adverse events.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what the science 
says.</p> 
<p> Dr. Harriet Hall on ScienceBasedMedicine.org, Aug 31, 2010</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Controversial it may be, but the science is clear enough to have caused a 
major American health insurer to stop paying for cervical spine SMT in 2010.1 
There has been little high quality scientific research to determine whether or 
not SMT really &ldquo;works,&rdquo; but what little does exist is discouraging 
indeed. Major reviews of that literature published in recent years came to 
&ldquo;underwhelming&rdquo; and half-baked conclusions. Thus, SMT failsthe 
&ldquo;impress me&rdquo; test &mdash; it might work, but it can&rsquo;t 
possibly work particularly well. An effective therapy should have no problem 
passing fair tests with flying colours.</p> 
<p>And yet spinal joint popping/cracking is a sensation that people crave. I 
am one of them! And most clinicians &mdash; including myself, and including 
serious skeptics like Dr. Homola &mdash; believe that some forms of SMT can be 
helpful to some of their patients, some of the time. There seems to be almost 
no doubt that there is<em>something</em> of therapeutic interest going on in 
SMT. In rare cases involving joint adhesions, mechanical &ldquo;locking&rdquo; 
and loss of mobility, appropriate manipulation has clear value &mdash; which is 
primarily why physical therapists perform spinal manipulation.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex picture, and it&rsquo;s made even more complex by the 
messy idea of &ldquo;subluxation.&rdquo; This is a chiropractic concept of<em>
some kind of spinal joint dysfunction</em>, with many shades of meaning &mdash; 
too many! Subluxation can mean many different things, depending on who is 
talking about it. Some chiropractors attribute great importance to subluxation, 
and &ldquo;use spinal manipulation to treat visceral disease.&rdquo;2 The 
chiropractic concept of subluxation has been both popular and controversial for 
many decades now, but it has never achieved medical respectability. It&rsquo;s 
problematic that SMT is often based on such a slippery concept.</p> 
<p>Perhaps it has too much baggage to be a useful term. </p> 
<p>Even if you put aside all concerns about the quality of the theory, there 
is still not a shred of scientific evidence that any kind of spinal joint 
dysfunction &mdash; no matter how you define it &mdash; has any importance to 
your general health. In more than a century, nothing like that has ever been 
shown to be true.3 So do chiropractic subluxations even exist? And, even if 
they did, would they actually cause any problem, serious or otherwise? And how 
serious are chiropractors about all this anyway? I&rsquo;ll address these 
questions over the next few sections.</p> 
<h4>Reality check: is there such a thing as a chiropractic 
&ldquo;subluxation&rdquo;?</h4> 
<p>Joint mechanics and neurology are just insanely complex, and when that 
complex system fails in any way, we could (and should) call it a &ldquo;joint 
dysfunction.&rdquo; Such terminology is nice and safe. We can cram almost any 
kind of theory into that label &mdash; almost anything that might go wrong with 
spinal joints &mdash; without going too far out on a limb. There is little 
doubt that spinal pain often involves<em>some</em> kind of &ldquo;joint 
dysfunction.&rdquo;</p> 
<h4>Cautiously not criticizing chiropractors</h4> 
<p>I&rsquo;m just another health care professional, with no special knowledge 
or experience with chiropractic. I am cautious about criticizing chiropractors 
directly on this website, because of their tendency to attack their critics 
legally, most notably in the case of the distinguished science writer Simon 
Singh in the UK. Publishing negative conclusions about chiropractic treatments 
is best left to the many experts and organizations who have chosen to fight 
that fight. All I can do here is summarize the controversies. I avoid strong 
conclusions of my own, deferring to the many credible experts who have already 
studied and written extensively on this subject. For more information about 
this delicate balance, please read mymore general summary of the controversies 
around chiropractic.</p> 
<p>But what kind? Chiropractors believe that they know: 
&ldquo;subluxation.&rdquo; A misalignment. A &ldquo;spine out of line.&rdquo;4 
Many doctors and scientists disagree!</p> 
<p>Chiropractors often propose &ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; as <em>both</em> the 
main cause of back and neck pain<em>and</em> of disease and poor health in 
general.5 The chiropractic idea of subluxation has been defined in many 
different ways over the years, but most definitions imply some kind of 
&ldquo;misalignment&rdquo; of the spinal joints that needs to be 
&ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s causing a disproportionate amount of 
trouble, both pain<em>and</em> poor health. This ominous definition of 
subluxation is both the most popular and the least defensible. Although there 
are other definitions &mdash; for instance, definitions that might be less 
controversial &mdash; they probably should not be used, because they are too 
easily confused with the main and original chiropractic definition.</p> 
<p>In standard medical terminology, a subluxation simply refers to a partial 
traumatic dislocation of a joint. Ligaments around the joint may be painfully 
sprained, and cause severe pain closely coupled to movement, slowly fading over 
many weeks, like any other sprain. Slightly subluxed spinal joints often return 
to a more or less normal position immediately, like a dislocated shoulder 
popping back in.</p> 
<p>Although that&rsquo;s not the kind of &ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; that this 
article is about, such cases<em>do</em> provide important perspective, in that 
a true dislocation can be amazingly asymptomatic. There are many case reports 
of true spinal joint derangement and injury that cause little or no trouble, or 
certainly much less than most people expect. In the low back pain tutorial, I 
describe one of my own former patients with a very serious lumbar dislocation 
&mdash; and no low back pain (she came to see me for a foot problem). Another 
patient with extreme scoliosis, although often uncomfortable, was generally 
surprisingly fine and even fit. The patient pictured here, as reported inNew 
England Journal of Medicine, had no &ldquo;pain, weakness, or 
parasthesia&rdquo;!6</p> ZOOM <br>

<h5>Traumatic dislocation.</h5> 
<p>For perspective, here&rsquo;s an example of a spine that is genuinely 
&ldquo;out of line.&rdquo; Although this is a serious dislocation, the patient 
was quite healthy. See&nbsp;Akhaddar.</p> ZOOM <br>

<h5>Traumatic dislocation.</h5> 
<p>For perspective, here&rsquo;s an example of a spine that is genuinely 
&ldquo;out of line.&rdquo; Although this is a serious dislocation, the patient 
was quite healthy. See&nbsp;Akhaddar.</p> 
<p>Another case report in the journal Spine describes a man who was born with 
part of a neck vertebra<em>entirely missing</em> &mdash; he also had no serious 
symptoms until he fell one day, and his unstable spine was dislocated &ldquo;.7 
After that he certainly was symptomatic: he had severe pain, but only pain.</p> 
<p>Another fun example of congential deformity or anatomical variation is The 
Amazing Owl Man! You don&rsquo;t see<em>this</em> every day. Enjoy this campy, 
cringe-inducing bit news reel about a dude who can &ldquo;owl&rdquo; his neck 
&mdash; rotate 180&#730; degrees! &mdash; if we can believe our eyes:</p> 
<p> Man turns his head 180 degrees 2:05</p> 
<p>What are we to make of this? Is this anything more than an eye-popping 
novelty? I have no idea<em>how</em> he can do that, but can I extract some 
clinical relevance from it anyway?<em>Nat&uuml;rlich!</em> (As my high school 
German language teacher used to say.) Many of these examples of dramatic joint 
injury and dysfunction actually cause<em>less</em> trouble than chiropractic 
subluxationsMany of these examples of dramatic joint injury and dysfunction 
actually cause<em>less</em> trouble than much less obvious chiropractic 
subluxations., never mind the more dire neurological problems that most people 
would assume to be the case, or the diseases and organ failures that much 
milder chiropractic subluxations can supposedly cause.</p> 
<p>If a painful or stuck-feeling neck or low back involves a 
&ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; in any sense other than partial dislocation, then, it 
must be something<em>more subtle</em> &mdash; something nowhere near so obvious 
as a traumatic injury &mdash; which puts it firmly in the category of the 
classic chiropractic subluxation.</p> 
<p>But is there even any such thing? There is a decades-old argument between 
doctors and chiropractors about the existence or nature of chiropractic-style 
subluxations. Many chiropractors still believe in them, in one form or another, 
and some do not.8 Sam Homola writes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>What I read in books written by orthopedic and physical medicine 
specialists made more sense to me than what I was being taught in chiropractic 
college. I rejected the vertebral subluxation theory as a basis for use of 
spinal manipulation.</p> 
<p>Sam Homola, Doctor of Chiropractic, in &ldquo;Can Chiropractors and 
Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work Together?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As far as most doctors and scientists are concerned, and even for many 
chiropractors, the argument is<em>long</em> over. They believe that either 
subluxations do not exist at all, or they only exist in some clinically 
insignificant form. They argue that chiropractors still can&rsquo;t prove they 
can even<em>find</em> alleged subluxations reliably, let alone treat them. They 
doubt that a spinal joint can be literally &ldquo;out&rdquo; in a clinically 
significant way, and the belief that it can &ldquo;keeps chiropractic 
marginalized and subject to ridicule by the scientific community&rdquo;.9 
Edzard Ernst writes, &ldquo;The concepts of chiropractic are not based on solid 
science and its therapeutic value has not been demonstrated beyond reasonable 
doubt.&rdquo;10</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In all the years that they have been talking about them, chiropractors have 
never been able to furnish proof of these mysterious subluxations which they 
alone are able to see. They may convince their clients, but never have they 
provided proof of their pretensions to men of science.</p> 
<p>College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of Quebec in 1966 in 
&ldquo;The scientific brief against chiropractic&rdquo;11</p> </blockquote> 
<h3>Reality check: are spinal nerves the wellspring of all health and vitality?
</h3> 
<p>Even if subluxations exist, chiropractic subluxation theory depends heavily 
on one premise, a conceptual bottleneck through which the entire theory must 
pass: that spinal nerve roots are terribly important to your health, and 
interfering with them spells T-R-O-U-B-L-E.</p> 
<h4>Spinal nerve roots do not hook up to organs!</h4> 
<p>Spinal nerve roots &mdash; the big bundles of nerves that pass between 
vertebrae &mdash; only handle nerve messages for<em>musculoskeletal structures
</em>, such as bones, muscles and skin. They do not send or receive signals 
from your &ldquo;guts&rdquo; at all. Cut one completely, and you&rsquo;ll 
paralyze something &mdash; but not an organ. Organs are controlled entirely by 
nerve tissues that do not pass through the spinal column, and by hormone 
signalling. I explain this in a little more detail in another article,Spinal 
Nerve Roots Do Not Hook Up to Organs!</p> 
<p>In fact, interfering with the nerve roots can only do so much harm to a 
person. Most of our health and vitality is regulated by mechanisms<em>other</em>
 than nerve signals travelling through nerve roots &mdash; by other kinds of 
nerves, and by hormones (see sidebar for details). Common trouble with nerve 
roots is limited to the garden-variety symptoms like pain, tingling, numbness, 
weakness, and so on &mdash; not organ failure and disease.12 That interference 
with nerves does not cause a wide variety of health problems is plainly evident 
in people with spinal injuries: they are<em>paralyzed</em>, not diseased.13 And 
that is only when the nerve roots are severely damaged or even severed. 
Slightly pinched nerve roots only spell P-A-I-N and A-N-N-O-Y-A-N-C-E, at worst 
&mdash; no fun, no indeed, but hardly disease.</p> 
<p>In any event, it&rsquo;s also anatomically impossible for spinal joints to 
physically &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; nerve roots with anything less than extreme 
deformities of the spine.14</p> 
<p>Some chiropractors go further with subluxation theory than others, and the 
further they go, the further out on a scientific limb they go. Most will argue 
that subluxations are<em>at least</em> responsible for chronic low back pain.
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely important to appreciate that minor variations in 
spinal anatomy are<em>normal</em>.15 Vertebrae are not Lego bricks, each one 
exactly like the other &mdash; they are biological and imperfect. Just because 
there is a slight variation in the lumps and bumps of your spine &mdash; 
something many of my patients worry about &mdash; does not mean that something 
is &ldquo;subluxed.&rdquo; And any such variation that is too subtle to be 
easily agreed upon is also unlikely to be clinically significant &mdash; and 
chiropractors, when tested, routinely<em>cannot agree</em> which joints in a 
given patient are actually &ldquo;out.&rdquo;16 One chiropractor will say it is 
the L3/4 joint that needs correcting, and the next will name another. This does 
not inspire confidence in the idea of subluxation.</p> 
<p>There may be some truth somewhere in the chiropractic idea of subluxation, 
but it is clearly loaded and controversial and variable in meaning &mdash; too 
much so to be clinically useful. Instead, I encourage you to think in terms of 
the broader concept of &ldquo;joint dysfunction&rdquo; &mdash; that spinal 
joints can &ldquo;misbehave,&rdquo; perhaps in a variety of ways. If this 
sounds vague, you&rsquo;re right &mdash; but that&rsquo;s appropriate, because 
strong confidence in anything more specific than that is not really justified 
by the science. For instance, an intervertebral joint might<em>move unevenly
</em>, as opposed to being <em>out of place,</em> and this could be clinically 
significant &mdash; but no one really knows.</p> 
<p>So joint dysfunction almost certainly does not involve partial dislocation, 
misalignment, and serious interference with nerve root function, as implied by 
the<em>traditional</em> definition of &ldquo;subluxation.&rdquo; But many 
chiropractors have argued that this is all they really mean by 
&ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; these days anyway &hellip;</p> 
<h4>Is chiropractic subluxation theory really so different? How many 
chiropractors even believe it?</h4> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip; we [chiropractors] have successfully distanced the concept of a 
chiropractic subluxation from that of an orthopedic subluxation.</p> 
<p>Rosner, The Role of Subluxation in Chiropractic, 1997 </p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard many chiropractors scoff dismissively that &ldquo;most 
chiropractors don&rsquo;t believe subluxation theory anymore anyway.&rdquo; 
Even if they are right, it admits that the profession is still burdened with a 
faction that<em>does</em> believe. But it&rsquo;s not that small a faction. In 
fact, it&rsquo;s probably a large one, between those who vocally defend the 
original, untainted theory and those who avoid the term because of its baggage 
but still believe it quietly, or who reject the most extreme versions but are 
still deeply influenced by the theory. Sam Homola:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Although many chiropractors are now backing away from the chiropractic 
vertebral subluxation theory, many continue to use the theory to justify 
treating a broad scope of health problems by &ldquo;adjusting&rdquo; the spine. 
&hellip; Some who do not use the word &ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; simply 
substitute another word or words, such as &ldquo;joint dysfunction,&rdquo; in 
support of their belief that some kind of segmental spinal &ldquo;lesion&rdquo; 
can affect overall health.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Openly defending the original chiropractic subluxation theory are many 
chiropractors who often call themselves &ldquo;straight&rdquo; chiropractors, 
meaning &ldquo;pure.&rdquo;<em>Straights</em> subscribe to the full, 
traditional &ldquo;subluxation theory&rdquo; more or less exactly as formulated 
more than a hundred years ago, they practice &ldquo;subluxation-based 
chiropractic,&rdquo; and they definitely think of a chiropractic subluxation as 
being<em>fundamentally different</em> than how a doctor would define 
subluxation. They believe that subluxations cause not only back and neck pain, 
but practically<em>any</em> health problem, simply by impinging or irritating 
spinal nerve roots.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>An orthopedic subluxation, a true vertebral misalignment, or a mechanical 
joint dysfunction that affects mobility in the spine is not the same as a 
mysterious asymptomatic &ldquo;chiropractic subluxation&rdquo; that is alleged 
to cause disease by interfering with nerve supply to organs.</p> 
<p>Chiropractic Vertebral Subluxations: Science vs. Pseudoscience, Homola (
ScienceBasedMedicine.org)</p> </blockquote> 
<h4>Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT): Adjustment, manipulation and cracking 
of the spinal joints</h4> 
<p>The idea of &ldquo;adjusting&rdquo; the spine refers to many different 
manual therapies, usually performed by chiropractors, but also sometimes 
performed by other professionals.17 The knuckle-like facet joints of the low 
back may be mobilized (wiggled, basically18), cracked (like knuckles), tapped 
with a chiropractic &ldquo;activator,&rdquo; gently stretched or pushed on, and 
so on and on. Different styles may be intense or gentle &mdash; so gentle in 
some cases that you can hardly tell that anything is being done to you. 
It&rsquo;s difficult to address them all at once, because there are so many 
different ways of going about it.</p> 
<p>Spinal manipulative therapy is an extremely controversial topic, partly 
because of its connection to subluxation theory, and partly in its own right 
&mdash; is it safe and does it work? However, SMT for the low back joints is 
notably much safer and therefore<em>less</em> controversial than SMT for the 
neck. In the case of the neck, the risks are almost certainly much higher 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s potentially lethal, in fact.19 I&rsquo;ll discuss this more 
below. Here are the main concerns about SMT:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><em>Dubious provenance.</em> SMT provided by chiropractors is largely 
based on the chiropractic idea of &ldquo;subluxation,&rdquo; which is itself a 
highly controversial theory that comes with a lot of baggage. To the extent 
that SMT is used to treat subluxations, it may be ill-conceived, 
over-prescribed, and inconsistent.</li> 
<li><em>Unimpressive benefits.</em> SMT probably has some therapeutic effects 
on low back and neck pain, but they seem quite limited, and some methods of SMT 
probably don&rsquo;t work at all. If SMT works at all, it certainly 
doesn&rsquo;t work well enough to be an impressive and reliable therapy.</li> 
<li><em>Serious risks.</em> SMT for low back pain has the potential to 
frighten patients and worsen their symptoms. SMT for the neck joints has the 
same risks, but with the chilling additional possibility that it can cause 
paralysis or death.</li> </ol> 
<p>Indeed, not as many people want their spines &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; as you 
might think. Despite the importance of the topic, only about 5% of the US 
population uses<em>any</em> kind of alternative therapy for their back pain, 
and only about 75% of those go to chiropractors.20 (SMT provided by physical 
therapists may be more common &mdash; I don&rsquo;t have a statistic for that.) 
Still, even a small slice of the entire population is an awful lot of people.
</p> 
<h4>Can SMT effectively treat neck and back pain? What does the science say?
</h4> 
<p>Sam Homola points out that &ldquo;there are at least 97 named antithetical 
adjustive techniques, all based on a nonsensical, nonfalsifiable chiropractic 
vertebral subluxation theory&rdquo;21 &mdash; almost a hundred variations of 
SMT that cannot peacefully co-exist, the truth of one invalidating the others, 
like religions. So it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that it&rsquo;s difficult to 
determine, scientifically, what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Proponents of a 
flavour of SMT have a handy, comfortable defense: &ldquo;my method is better 
than the method that was tested.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Every published review of the literature comments on the lack of <em>good 
quality</em> evidence, making it impossible to be <em>confident</em> of 
anything.22 Even the most promising sources of research have had serious 
quality control problems.23 And yet plenty of that research evidence &mdash; 
weak though it may be &mdash; does give some hope that certain kinds of SMT 
might have some benefits.2425262728</p> 
<p>However, most of those conclusions are also qualified by various gotchas 
and uncertainties. Sometimes even major journals publish results that sound 
fabulous, but critics find flaws so major that it one wonders if it was even 
worth doing. There was a particularly noteworthy example early in 2011.29 Neil 
O&rsquo;Connell:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The email from the industry was effusive. In a cock-a-hoop, caps lock-happy 
frenzy it bellowed &ldquo;ALL MANUAL MEDICINE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS 
STUDY.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Or not? Mr. O&rsquo;Connell readily identified numerous serious problems 
with this research in an article for Body In Mind:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It is of course possible that the results of this study are accurate and 
maintenance manipulations are effective, but these problems make it difficult 
to judge. The message from this one back pain trial might seem appealing and I 
can see why the email was so enthusiastic. But by focusing on one particular 
cherry that seems so ripe and juicy we might miss the bigger picture from the 
rest of the tree. And there is always the chance that the tastiest cherries 
contain a few artificial sweeteners. Personally I would lay off the caps lock 
for now.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So much for that hype.</p> 
<p>And some studies, of course, have had negative results. For example, in 
1998, Daniel Cherkin (with medical back pain expert Richard Deyo) published a 
paper in theNew England Journal of Medicine showing that, over the long-term, 
&ldquo;patients receiving [chiropractic manipulation] treatments had only 
marginally better outcomes than those receiving the minimal intervention of an 
educational booklet.&rdquo;30 Dr. Nikolai Bogduk weighs in with a paper stating 
his conclusion right in the title, &ldquo;Spinal manipulation for neck pain 
does not work.&rdquo;31</p> 
<p>One of the most recent experiments is a good one to zoom in on, because it 
damns SMT with faint praise: it is one of the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; studies, 
but so mildly positive that one can&rsquo;t help feeling disappointed by it. Is 
this the best SMT can do?</p> 
<h3>SMT competes with standard care &hellip; barely</h3> 
<p>In the fall of 2009, the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases published a 
reasonably good test of SMT.32 </p> 
<p>The researchers took a hundred patients with nasty, fresh cases of acute 
low back pain, and delivered half of them into the care of chiropractors, and 
the other half into &ldquo;standard care&rdquo; &mdash; advice and ordinary 
pain medications, namely. Note that it has often been argued that SMT is best 
for acute low back pain, not chronic, so this is right in chiropractic&rsquo;s 
strike zone: if there is anything special, anything even remotely impressive 
about SMT, it<em>should</em> have done rather well in this contest. It should 
actually pretty much pull out a can of whupass on &ldquo;advice and 
meds.&rdquo; One would hope.</p> 
<p>It didn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>There was basically no difference between the groups. They did equally well 
&mdash; or equally poorly, if you prefer. All the patients had the same 
experience that pretty much everyone with chronic back pain has: they got 
better slowly but surely over the course of a few weeks, roughly exactly as 
they would have without any therapy at all. The researchers found that 
&ldquo;SMT is unlikely to result in relevant early pain reduction in patients 
with acute low back pain.&rdquo;</p> Both groups did equally well &mdash; or 
equally poorly, if you prefer. 
<p>Now you might say, &ldquo;Well, good: chiropractic was as good as drugs, so 
it could replace drugs. And that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; But those drugs, taken in 
the quantities the subjects took them, are cheap and safe as houses. And their 
low cost was roughly appropriate for their took-the-edge-off effectiveness. 
Chiropractic therapy, by contrast, would have cost an order of magnitude more 
and required spending time on appointments with chiropractors.</p> 
<p>So, yes, SMT &ldquo;worked&rdquo; &mdash; <em>but how well?</em> How <em>
impressed</em> are you by SMT&rsquo;s performance in this test? On a scale of 
ten?</p> 
<h3>Formal reviews of and expert opinions on this mess</h3> 
<p>The scientific bottom line is (obviously) ambiguous. Attempts to extract an 
overall research conclusion from the studies that have been done are pretty 
tentative. In 2004, a big review of the literature published inSpine presented 
a lovely rats&rsquo; nest of conclusions, some of which were positive, some 
negative, all of which amounted to, &ldquo;Um, it&rsquo;s kinda complicated, 
and we&rsquo;re not really sure.&rdquo;33</p> 
<p>In 2011, an (updated) Cochrane (good!) review of SMT research was published.
34 Cochrane reviews are pretty much the best available summaries of the 
available evidence, and unfortunately the authors just weren&rsquo;t that 
impressed. In 2006, the authors came to the underwhelming conclusion that 
&ldquo;there is no evidence that spinal manipulative therapy is superior to 
other standard treatments for patients with acute or chronic low back 
pain.&rdquo; It also performed no worse, though, and was more effective than a 
fake intervention &mdash; so at least there&rsquo;s that. In 2011, considering 
a bunch of new evidence, they still found SMT to be &ldquo;no better or 
worse&rdquo; than other therapies &hellip; which damned it again with very 
faint praise, of course, because<em>no</em> therapy has ever been shown to be 
all that effective for low back pain.</p> 
<h4>Could benefits of some SMT have been &ldquo;washed out&rdquo;?</h4> 
<p>A fair criticism of big reviews of the science is that they lump together 
too many kinds of SMT for too many different kinds of patients. What if SMT 
works really well when done one way, with one kind of patient, but quite poorly 
otherwise? Real benefits in specific situations might disappear or &ldquo;wash 
out&rdquo; when mixed in with too many other scenarios where a therapy is 
doomed to failure.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, any <em>truly worthwhile</em> benefits to SMT (in any 
situation) should be obvious, noteworthy, and more than capable of standing out 
and pulling up the average. So while I concede that modest real benefits of SMT 
might get obscured and overshadowed in a big review, I doubt that<em>significant
</em> benefits would ever vanish into the statistics. Thus we are still left 
with SMT being damned with faint praise here. AsNeil O&rsquo;Connell of Body in 
Mind described these results: &ldquo;a tiny effect size for manipulation that 
doesn&rsquo;t really tickle the undercarriage of clinical significance.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>These conclusions are all generally echoed by another major review in 2010.
35</p> 
<p>So the jury is <em>way</em> out, here. What this mess of science (more 
examples!36) amounts to for patients is that SMT is pretty unimpressive on 
average, and a bit of a crapshoot &hellip; but possibly worth a shot for the 
particularly desperate patient. Chiropractor Sam Homola sums the situation up 
nicely:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There is no definitive evidence that spinal manipulative therapy is more 
effective than other forms of treatment for patients with acute or chronic 
low-back pain. However, manual therapists know from experience that spinal 
manipulation is often more effective for providing immediate short-term relief 
for some types of back pain.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Can Chiropractors and Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work 
Together?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This echoes his opinion in his 1999 book, Inside Chiropractic: A 
Patient&rsquo;s Guide, that &ldquo;many patients have told me that manipulation 
was more effective [than physiotherapeutic management] in providing immediate 
relief.&rdquo;37 My own clients have often reported the same thing. The 
benefits are almost certainly there, for some people, some of the time.</p> 
<p>But, just as clearly, SMT is not working any miracles, and thus it fails 
the &ldquo;impress me&rdquo; test completely. Some evidence may support SMT, 
but it doesn&rsquo;t support it<em>strongly.</em> No one &mdash; or almost no 
one &mdash; is getting &ldquo;cured.&rdquo; After decades of study, the 
effectiveness of a therapy should be<em>quite clear and significant</em>. If 
it&rsquo;s still hopelessly mired in controversy, how good can it possibly be? 
That&rsquo;s an awkward question for a lot of alternative therapies.</p> But, 
just as clearly, SMT is not working any miracles, and thus it fails the 
&ldquo;impress me&rdquo; test completely. Some evidence may support SMT, but it 
doesn&rsquo;t support it<em>strongly.</em> 
<h4>Is SMT safe?</h4> 
<p>In a word, <em>no</em>: SMT is definitely <em>not</em> a risk-free 
treatment. Few treatments are completely safe, of course. Other manual 
therapies are also unsafe. Half of all manual therapy treatments of any kind 
will result in<em>some</em> kind of unpleasant side effect.38 Unsurprisingly, 
neck manipulation can cause trouble &mdash; it&rsquo;s a vulnerable structure. 
There is a risk of life-threatening injury to the brain stem or vertebral 
arteries. This is unlikely but extremely serious, and I&rsquo;ll cover that 
separately in the<em>next</em> section. This section covers the <em>lesser</em> 
risks.</p> 
<h4>It&rsquo;s all relative</h4> 
<p>Note that the 25% and 100% stats are <em>relative</em> risk measurements: 
the risk compared to<em>not</em> getting treated &mdash; not the overall 
likelihood, which cannot be measured from this kind of data.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;100% more likely to be injured&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;twice as 
likely,&rdquo; which sounds bad &mdash; really bad. But there&rsquo;s some hard 
math here, and it all depends on how you look at it. Virtually all treatments 
have risks! For perspective, &ldquo;Aspirin use, even at doses below 300 mg/day 
and despite modified release formulations, has been associated with a two to 
threefold increased risk of developing upper gastrointestinal tract 
complications (i.e., bleeding or perforation)&rdquo; (BMC Medicine, 
Hern&aacute;ndez-D&iacute;az, Rodr&iacute;guez, 2006). And yet people find the 
benefits of aspirin to be worth the risks.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not really surprising that neck manipulation is twice as likely 
to do harm as<em>not</em> manipulating &mdash; but is it worth it? That&rsquo;s 
the important question, and a hard one to answer.</p> 
<p>In 2010, Carlesso&nbsp;et&nbsp;al analysed the scientific literature 
looking for evidence of harm from SMT for the neck.39 They found a 
statistically insignificant trend towards the negative, an uncertain number 
that leaned in the direction of bad news: increased neck pain might be<em>25%
</em> more likely with SMT than if you did nothing, or if you just stuck to 
safe and neutral treatments. The same data could also suggest basically the 
opposite: that there probably are no noteworthy harms, or they would have 
showed up nice and clearly. That&rsquo;s a fair point, but also a debatable 
one. However, increased neck pain is not an unrelated side effect that can be 
tolerated as a cost of overall progress: it&rsquo;s a worsening of the symptom 
being treated, a backfire!</p> 
<p>More certainly and strikingly, SMT patients are <em>100% more likely</em> 
to have &ldquo;transient neurological symptoms&rdquo; &mdash; anything from 
feeling a bit woozy all the way up to serious unpleasantness, such as severe 
dizziness, nausea and vomiting. A typical case is described inWhat Happened To 
My Barber?.</p> 
<p>When performed intensely and/or carelessly &mdash; in the presence of 
undiagnosed vulnerabilities, say &mdash; SMT can cause direct injury. Even a 
completely healthy spinal joint could be mildly injured by a strong enough 
spinal manipulation. Most such injuries would be both rare and minor. Only 
extremely aggressive SMT could injure a healthy spine, and even if it did, it 
would probably just be a minor strain &mdash; hardly the result you want, but 
not that big deal and not that common.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;the chances of injury are multiplied when chiropractic neck 
manipulation is routinely used many times on every patient in a misguided 
attempt to improve health, as opposed to occasional use of neck manipulation by 
physical therapists and other manual therapists who are concerned only about 
restoring mobility in a stiff spine.</p> 
<p>Chiropractic Vertebral Subluxations: Science vs. Pseudoscience, Homola (
ScienceBasedMedicine.org)</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The risks to an <em>unhealthy</em> spine are also quite rare, but somewhat 
more serious. Most practitioners are unlikely to use aggressive SMT on a spine 
exhibiting symptoms of any trauma, disease or other vulnerability. However, 
mistakes happen &mdash; it&rsquo;s unlikely, but possible.</p> 
<p>The main <em>common</em> risk of SMT, however, is psychological: SMT can 
badly frighten patients, which is a serious risk factor for chronic neck and 
back pain. This is certainly not a life-threatening risk, but it&rsquo;s not 
trivial either. The nervous patient has much to lose with SMT. Patients may be 
nervous because:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>they believe their spine is more fragile and vulnerable than it really is 
(and talk of &ldquo;subluxations&rdquo; usually aggravates this anxiety), 
and/or because</li> 
<li>the idea of spinal adjustment bothers them in any case (many people are 
&ldquo;freaked out&rdquo; by the idea of spinal joint cracking40).</li> </ul> 
<p>Combining these factors &mdash; acute pain, minor potential therapeutic 
benefits, a high rate of harm, fear of your spine&rsquo;s fragility, fear of 
the treatment &mdash; is all just a recipe for disaster. And so, although many 
clients have reported being &ldquo;cured&rdquo; by chiropractic treatment 
(sometimes even as they limp into my office still suffering from significant 
symptoms), many also have reported being &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; by a chiropractic 
treatment they found to be intense and terrifying and painful.</p> 
<p>This unfortunate situation may then be more deeply aggravated by the 
therapist&rsquo;s response: using the bad reaction as evidence of profound 
structural instability in the spine, and as a justification for (much) more 
treatment. People tend to emerge from such experiences hopelessly tangled up in 
the idea that they are fragile, broken and need regular SMT for the rest of 
their lives. It is quite tragic how one bad day can convince people that they 
have a<em>really</em> &ldquo;bad back&rdquo; that needs regular therapy almost 
forever.</p> 
<p>Another surprising risk is that, even if all you have is back pain, 
chiropractors may recommend SMT for the neck even when your only symptoms are 
in your low back.41 And, as mentioned above, there may be substantial risks to 
neck adjustment.<em>And</em> most chiropractors don&rsquo;t inform their 
patients about the risks.42 Let&rsquo;s look at that topic now.</p> People tend 
to emerge from bad SMT experiences hopelessly tangled up in the idea that they 
are fragile. 
<h4>SMT for the neck can probably maim and kill</h4> 
<p>SMT can probably cause stroke in one of two ways, either by tearing 
delicate blood vessels in the neck, or by causing brain stem injury in persons 
with unsuspected instability of the upper spine (atlantoaxial instability, 
AAI). The evidence for this will be discussed as we proceed. These hazards are 
certainly more likely for patients with severe and chronic symptoms. These are 
also therefore the patients most likely to desperately try a wide variety of 
treatment options,<em>including more aggressive and frequent neck adjustments.
</em></p> 
<p>Disturbingly, AAI is such a complex condition that even substantial 
dislocation of the upper cervical spine can be clinically silent, and virtually 
impossible to diagnose without a specific type of X-ray (a type that 
chiropractors do<em>not</em> generally do).43 Thus, some people with AAI are 
walking around without so much as a headache as a warning sign &hellip; yet 
they are vulnerable to severe brain stem injury if they receive cervical SMT.
</p> 
<p>Less serious but <em>extremely unpleasant</em> consequences are also 
possible for patients with AAI. A<em>light</em> poke in the brain stem 
won&rsquo;t kill you, but it can sure ruin your day! I knew a woman with a 
confirmed case of post-traumatic AAI who was treated too roughly by a student 
massage therapist, and she suffered about a day of severe disorientation, 
vertigo, and vomiting.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s what a poke in brain stem can do.</p> 
<p>Incredibly, some therapists may dismiss such severe reactions with the 
absurdly unsafe theory that the body is just processing toxins released during 
the treatment. It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine a more daft and irresponsible 
rationalization for a serious treatment mistake. For an emotionally compelling 
example of such dangerous incompetence, see the articleWhat Happened To My 
Barber?</p> 
<p>These dangers are, like everything else about SMT, controversial. <em>Proof
</em> of the danger is hard to come by. Above we discussed a study by 
Carlesso&nbsp;et&nbsp;al showing strong evidence that minor to moderate 
neurological side effects are more than twice as likely with SMT than with 
other neck treatments. But they did not find &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; proof 
that neck adjustment can kill. In fact, they didn&rsquo;t even try to calculate 
the relative risk &mdash; the data just wasn&rsquo;t up to the task. That 
doesn&rsquo;t mean that the phenomenon doesn&rsquo;t exist.44</p> 
<p>Considering the relatively minor benefits and the high stakes, is <em>any
</em> risk acceptable? This has been a subject of fierce debate for many years, 
with the chiropractic profession consistently on the defensive.45 Credible 
experts continue to publish evidence that concern about this issue is 
justified. For instance, in recent years the journalPhysical Therapy concluded 
that &ldquo;the literature does not demonstrate that the benefits of 
manipulation of the cervical spine outweigh the risks,&rdquo;46 and the journal 
Spine concluded that &ldquo;adverse reactions to chiropractic care for neck 
pain are common.&rdquo;47 The value of a treatment must be weighed against the 
potential harm. As a group of Canadian neurologists ask, &ldquo;Is a headache 
worth dying for?&rdquo; Their concerns are outlined in a detailed document, 
&ldquo;Statement of Concern to the Canadian Public from Canadian Neurologists 
Regarding the Debilitating and Fatal Damage Manipulation of the Neck May Cause 
to the Nervous System.&rdquo;48</p> 
<p>Even the most dire risks to treatment are not necessarily unacceptable, 
however. The chances of dying in an accident on the way to the dry cleaner is 
probably much greater. For the chronic neck pain patient, the risks may be 
acceptable<em>if</em> there&rsquo;s a reason to believe the treatment might 
actually work. Some cases of neck pain and crick are extremely severe &mdash; 
and such patients may literally feel they have little to lose.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the rationale and scientific evidence to support the use of 
SMT for neck pain is poor, and some methods of SMT are almost certainly 
useless. In chiropractic offices with a traditional view (the majority), most 
of the point of SMT is to treat &ldquo;subluxation&rdquo; -- which, as we've 
discussed, is an idea so under siege that many chiropractors themselves have 
denounced it. If SMT is largely supposed to treat a problem that is poorly 
defined and highly controversial at best, and maybe doesn&rsquo;t exist at all, 
how good can it possibly be?</p> 
<h3>Ineffective variants of SMT</h3> 
<p>Finally, there is the problem of SMT methods that are probably less 
effective. According to Dr. Homola, responsible chiropractic therapy for back 
pain should mostly be limited to mobilizing (wiggling) the lumbar 
intervertebral joints. However, there are numerous<em>other</em> methods.</p> 
<p>A good example is the common use of an &ldquo;activator&rdquo; &mdash; a 
little tool that gently thumps the skin and muscle over the joint. The 
rationale for the use of the activator is extremely thin, in my opinion, and 
there is no credible evidence whatsoever that it actually does anything &mdash; 
it&rsquo;s virtually unstudied, nor is there much reason to study it &mdash; 
it&rsquo;s just not a strong idea.</p> 
<p>Considering that even standard SMT isn&rsquo;t working any miracles, you 
need to be skeptical of obscure variations on it, especially the 
&ldquo;subtle&rdquo; ones that hardly seem to be doing anything.</p> 
<h3>Scratching the itch you can&rsquo;t reach: why joint popping feels good 
and possibly relieves pain</h3> 
<p>Joint popping and cracking can feel <em>great.</em> I know. I&rsquo;m a 
crack addict, a junkie. Many of my joints pop easily and pleasantly, even if I 
don&rsquo;t make the effort to do so. I find it hard to imagine life without 
joint popping!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m hardly alone. I have also observed many clients expressing relief 
and pleasure in response to incidental spinal &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo; &mdash; 
joint pops that occur in the course of doing massage therapy, little explosions 
as I glide up the spine. Many people seem to feel that a successful spinal 
adjustment feels like &ldquo;scratching an itch you can&rsquo;t reach.&rdquo; 
The same feeling can result even without a pop. This feeling needs explaining!
</p> 
<p>Why does joint popping feel good? If SMT works, why does it work, and does 
it have anything to do with this relieving sensation?</p> 
<h4>Popping and cracking versus mobilizing</h4> 
<p>A spinal joint pop/crack is probably not a required effect of SMT, and 
plenty of SMT is done without the intention of cracking. Sometimes the 
knuckle-like facet joints pop, and sometimes they don&rsquo;t. Once 
they&rsquo;ve popped, they tend not to pop again for a while &mdash; what is 
known as the &ldquo;recharge&rdquo; phenomenon &mdash; and yet SMT can 
continue. The goal of SMT is to stimulate the joint, not to pop it.</p> 
<p>The pretty obvious honest answer is that <em>no one knows.</em> If we knew 
<em>how</em> SMT worked, we would also know <em>if</em> it works! Obviously, if 
there were any clear science on this, SMT wouldn&rsquo;t be controversial.</p> 
<p>Whatever you have been told before, and despite the availability of many 
explanations on the internet, the nature of joint popping is<em>not well 
understood.</em>49 It is firmly in that category of trivial mysteries for which 
there is simply no research funding, and as such it will probably remain 
unexplained for some time to come. We simply do not know.</p> 
<p>What is reasonably certain is that joint pops (and mobilizations) probably 
constitutes<em>novel sensory input</em>: a little blast of proprioceptive 
stimulation.50 Since all living systems seem to thrive on sensory input, and 
generally suffer without it, I speculate that a joint crack or mobilization 
feels something like getting &ldquo;unstuck,&rdquo; roughly the same feeling as 
finally getting to stretch your legs after getting off a long flight &mdash; 
and that analogy is not intended to trivialize it. The sensation of relief may 
be extremely strong! (In both the case of a joint pop and the stretching 
example.) The details of such a physiological effect are definitely not well 
understood, but the effect probably exists in some form.</p> 
<p>The strength of this idea is that it has the potential to explain a lot, 
but without claiming too much. It&rsquo;s reasonable and plausible. It can 
account for the satisfied feelings many people report, but it doesn&rsquo;t 
promise the moon, either. Indeed, it might explain both why SMT works, and why 
it doesn&rsquo;t work particularly well. For instance, it&rsquo;s consistent 
with a widely reported problem with spinal adjustments: the benefits often 
don&rsquo;t last long! Soon the &ldquo;itch&rdquo; needs to be 
&ldquo;scratched&rdquo; again.51</p> 
<p>It also probably explains another common problem with SMT: why treatment 
results seem to be all over the map. What the nervous system does with novel 
sensory input certainly depends on a lot of factors. Some people, some of the 
time, seem to be able to enjoy and &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; such sensations and 
get a therapeutic effect. Other patients seem to largely ignore it &mdash; it 
just doesn&rsquo;t make much of an impression on them. Still others are<em>
afraid</em> of it! For that not-so-minor minority who find joint popping kind 
of alarming, SMT won&rsquo;t seem refreshing and relieving, but more like a 
bitter medicine (at best) or just a bad idea. Such an unpleasant psychological 
context is probably all the more severe in the case of low back pain, where 
structural problems are so often feared by patients.</p> 
<p>In the best case scenario, could such a simple sensory experience help to 
actually &ldquo;cure&rdquo; severe or chronic neck and back pain? Probably in a 
few cases, yes.</p> 
<p>For instance, under the right conditions, the novel sensory input of SMT 
might have a significant therapeutic effect on muscle knots (trigger points). 
Bear in mind what gives trigger points their clinical importance: they often 
both<em>cause</em> and <em>complicate</em> other problems. Trigger points form 
in response to a joint that is dysfunctional for some other reason. Joint 
dysfunction and trigger points probably reinforce each other. Joint 
manipulation may help to break this vicious cycle, either relieving some of the 
reason the trigger points are persisting, or relieving the trigger points 
themselves.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since trigger points are clinically significant in general, and the likely 
cause of most back pain, and can often be lessened or relieved by virtually any 
physical stimulation, it&rsquo;s not surprising that there is a strong 
resemblance between the satisfaction of a good rub and the satisfaction of a 
good crack. A crack is effectively just a kind of &ldquo;massage&rdquo; of the 
joint and the tissues around it, and thus SMT may be about as relieving as 
anything else (i.e. heat, massage, stretching) that tends to reduce the 
discomfort of trigger points and stagnant, &ldquo;grouchy&rdquo; tissues.</p> 
<h3>Minimizing the risks of SMT</h3> 
<p>What you almost certainly want to avoid is the worst-of-both-worlds 
scenario in which you take the risks for the sake of a treating<em>mild</em> 
neck pain or &mdash; yeeks &mdash; only as a preventative treatment (as 
chiropractors often recommend).52 Don&rsquo;t do that! There is simply no 
justification for SMT for the neck unless you have a problem that is<em>worth 
the risk.</em></p> 
<p>Here are some guidelines that <em>may</em> improve your chances of getting 
benefit from this approach, and minimizing risk. Evidence published byManual 
Therapy shows that, if neck manipulation works at all, it may be more likely to 
work for people with these signs and symptoms.53 Perhaps to some extent this is 
also true of low back pain. Check all that apply to you:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>the severity of your case is mild or moderate, not severe (yes, this 
contradicts what I said above54)</p> 
<p>your neck pain is on both sides some or all of the time</p> 
<p>your neck feels better with movement and exercise</p> 
<p>you aren&rsquo;t stuck in a chair more than 5 hours a day</p> 
<p>tipping the head back isn&rsquo;t a problem</p> 
<p>you have no sharp, shooting pains into the arms</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p>And here are few more guidelines for safety of my own:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Avoid cervical adjustment if you have a history of nausea and/or vomiting 
associated with your neck pain, or with neck movement. Please be aware that not 
all physical therapists will recognize these symptoms as warning signs!</p> 
<p>Avoid extremes of treatment intensity. Strong neck adjustments may be 
dangerous, subtle ones may be useless. There is obviously less potential harm 
in a gentler treatment (except to your pocket book, perhaps).</p> 
<p>Avoid overprescription. (How much is too much?55) If you sense that a 
chiropractor or other health care professional wants to set you up for long 
term regular therapy, find someone else to help you.</p> 
<p>Avoid rationalizing of adverse effects. If neck mobilization/manipulation 
is going to help you, you should not experience<em>any</em> severe side effects 
&mdash; a little soreness or increased symptoms at the worst. Avoid any 
practitioner who tries to explain away significant side effects (i.e., 
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the toxins being cleared out&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>Trust your instincts! Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of neck 
adjustment. That concern could be the wisdom of your body talking to you (or it 
could also be irrational). But consider listening to that little voice!</p> 
<p>Inquire about the possibility of treating the neck by adjusting the <em>
thoracic</em> spine. Thoracic spinal adjustment may help with neck pain,56 but 
feels safer because it almost certainly<em>is</em> safer. This is a 
particularly worthwhile option to consider if you feel nervous about neck 
adjustments.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>If you discover, or already know, that cervical spine adjustment is helpful 
for you, make an effort to find a chiropractor you trust, and establish a long 
term relationship, confident that most of the risks discussed here will be 
eliminated. &ldquo;Good science-based chiropractors who do not subscribe to the 
vertebral subluxation theory and who use manipulation appropriately can offer a 
service of value,&rdquo; Sam Homola writes. &ldquo;Unfortunately, such 
chiropractors are not easy to find.&rdquo;</p> <br>

weakness or altered sensation. That such a serious injury can have so little 
impact on a person is quite interesting!<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>

<blockquote>  A 22-year-old man presented with a 10-day history of 
torticollis. Two months before presentation, he had fallen from standing height 
but did not report subsequent cervical pain, weakness, or paresthesia. On 
examination, there was a reduced range of movement of the cervical spine 
without other neurologic deficits. Radiography of the cervical spine showed a 
marked reversal of the cervical lordosis, anterior displacement of 60% of C4 on 
C5, anterior callus formation, bilateral facet dislocation, and increased 
posterior interspinous distance (double arrow) (Panel A). Magnetic resonance 
imaging was performed. Sagittal T2-weighted imaging revealed a spinal cord 
angulation with mild compression but without intramedullary edema or hemorrhage 
(Panel B). The patient was admitted for surgery. With the use of an anterior 
approach, diskectomy, tricortical bone grafting, and insertion of a cervical 
plate were carried out, with a good outcome. </blockquote> BACK TO TEXT</li>

of a man who developed severe neck and shoulder pain after a fall. It turned 
out that a part of one of his neck vertebrae was entirely missing, since birth

the joint substantially. Although painful, the lack of neurological symptoms is 
surprising &mdash; and more evidence that nerve roots are not easily pinched.
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>

<blockquote> <em>STUDY DESIGN:</em> Case description. <em>OBJECTIVES:</em> To 
describe a case of traumatic subluxation in association with a congenitally 
absent cervical pedicle, and review the pertinent medical literature. <em>
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:</em> The congenital absence of a cervical pedicle 
is a relatively uncommon developmental anomaly that is frequently mistaken for 
a unilateral facet fracture-dislocation in the context of acute trauma. Because 
there is little evidence of recovery after surgery, and the symptoms are 
usually not disabling, surgery is not recommended for most cases. <em>METHODS:
</em> A 62-year-old man presented with severe neck and right shoulder pain 
after falling. Plain radiographs and computed tomography of the cervical spine 
showed the typical features of a congenitally absent pedicle at C6 with 
anterolisthesis of C6 on C7. We performed anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 
because of persistent neck pain and progressive instability. <em>RESULTS:</em> 
Complete restoration of the C6-C7 subluxation was achieved with resolution of 
the presenting symptoms. At 18 months follow-up, flexion and extension dynamic 
radiographs demonstrated good alignment with solid fusion at C6-C7. <em>
CONCLUSION:</em> Although conservative treatment is the primary treatment for 
this clinical entity, surgery is an alternative option for those patients who 
fail to achieve recovery after conservative treatment or exhibit instability.

nerve roots exit the spine are quite generous, not at all a tight fit, and that 
only major injuries or disease processes can result in a pinched nerve root in

Comments:</strong> This review of manual therapies focusses on spinal 
manipulative therapy and massage therapy for low back and neck pain, with 
predictably underwhelming results: both are &ldquo;effective&rdquo; in some 
circumstances but certainly not impressively so, and generally no different 
from other therapies that help a little but haven&rsquo;t exactly put a dent in 
the epidemic. For instance, the authors write that SMT is effective but 
&ldquo;similar in effect to other commonly used efficacious therapies such as 
usual care, exercise, or back school.&rdquo; Um, that&rsquo;s nice. I&rsquo;m 
thrilled for SMT that it can hold it&rsquo;s own against &ldquo;back 
school&rdquo; &mdash; which, of course, is so legendary for curing low back 
pain!<br>
<br>
 The conclusions about SMT in particular are silly. The data is 
consistent with what other major reviews have concluded, most notably the 2011 
Cochrane review (Rubinstein&nbsp;et&nbsp;al). BACK TO TEXT</li> 
<li>Back in 1996, Hurwitz wrote that &ldquo;cervical spine manipulation and 
mobilization probably provide at least short-term benefits for some patients 
with neck pain and headaches.&rdquo; Not exactly a glowing endorsement. But 
more recent and thorough reviews of the literature have been even less 
enthusiastic. In 2004,Bronfort wrote in Spine that &ldquo;There are few 
studies, and the evidence is currently inconclusive,&rdquo; and that for 
chronic neck pain, mobilization/manipulation &ldquo;offers at most similar pain 
relief to &hellip; rehabilitative exercise in the short and long term.&rdquo; 
Going from bad to worse, in 2006Spine published an even more authoritative 
review of the scientific literature fromThe Cochrane Collaboration, concluding 
that neck adjustments are &ldquo;not beneficial&rdquo; when used alone (it did 
qualify that there was evidence that neck adjustments could work<em>when 
combined with exercises</em>, which doesn&rsquo;t exactly make it sound like a 
miracle cure). Headaches are a closely related issue, so what if we look there? 
Does it get any better if the goal of neck adjustment is to relieve headache 
pain? Unfortunately, the problems are identical. In a 2006Fernandez-de-las-Penas
 wrote, &ldquo;No controlled trials analyzing exclusively the effects of spinal 
mobilization were found,&rdquo; and that what does exist has &ldquo;overall 
poor methodology.&rdquo; Also in 2006,Lenssinck concluded that &ldquo;there is 
insufficient evidence to either support or refute the effectiveness of 
physiotherapy and (spinal) manipulation in patients with tension-type 
headache.&rdquo;BACK TO TEXT</li>

The sound bite in this study is that 20-40% of all manual therapy treatments 
&mdash; massage, chiropractic, physiotherapy &mdash; will cause some kind of 
unpleasantness, side effect or &ldquo;adverse event&rdquo; in medicalspeak.<br>

<br> In a word: yikes! <br>
<br>
 Perspective cuts both ways here. On the one 
hand, it&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds: these &ldquo;events&rdquo; are minor 
and moderate in severity; only 1 or 2 per thousand visits causes a serious 
problem; and drugs are actually relatively worse. That is, you are modestly<em>
more</em> likely to have an &ldquo;adverse event&rdquo; if you are given a 
pill. This just refers to typical side effects, such as ibuprofen&rsquo;s 
tendency to cause indigestion.<br>
<br>
 But when you take a pill, the side 
effect is usually unrelated to the problem (i.e. it doesn&rsquo;t make the 
problem you&rsquo;re treating worse), you are generally trading those side 
effects for some pretty clear benefits, and it&rsquo;s usually cheap. In manual 
therapy, most adverse events are backfires &mdash; that is, you go for a neck 
adjustment at the chiropractor, and you come out with more neck pain instead of 
less. Other data shows this is 25% more likely than if you did nothing at all 
(seeCarlesso). And you pay through the nose for this! Manual therapy is much 
more expensive than most drug therapy.<br>
<br>
 Manual therapists routinely 
claim that their services are much safer and more effective than drug 
therapies. Yet this data pretty clearly shows that the difference is really not 
great. Depending on how you look at it, drugs are only a little worse in some 
ways, or maybe a little better in other ways. But no matter how you slice it, 
20-40% is a pretty unpleasant rate of harm &mdash; especially at 
$60&ndash;120/hour!BACK TO TEXT</li>

<li>Chiropractors do this because many of them either subscribe to a belief 
that the whole spine is greatly affected by the condition of the cervical 
joints, particularly the top one. So chiropractors may well throw in a little 
neck adjusting, with varying degrees of conviction about its importance. But 
the idea is as controversial and questionable as any idea in all of 
chiropractic.BACK TO TEXT</li>

&ldquo;there is no correlation between the measure of hypermobility and the 
presence of clinical symptoms. Also, the validity of the upper-cervical 
stability tests is questionable.&rdquo;BACK TO TEXT</li> 
<li>Here be statistical dragons. At first glance, the lack of a smoking gun 
might seem to indicate that such serious harms are unlikely &mdash; 
wouldn&rsquo;t a problem show up if it were serious? And that is exactly how I 
would spin my analysis if I were a chiropractor! But that signal would show up 
only if the research were actually designed to detect it in the first place. 
These authors were simply going through data from many small studies of neck 
adjustment, in which some rotten reactions were noted, while many other studies 
were disqualified for not tracking harms at all and &mdash; this is interesting 
&mdash; for &ldquo;notable ascertainment bias.&rdquo; Translation: some of the 
studies were written by authors likely to ignore, deny and minimize evidence of 
harm
<p></p> 
<p>In the end, only 32 studies could be analyzed. So it remains entirely 
possible that the phenomenon of severe neck injury from SMT is real but rare, 
and simply didn&rsquo;t occur in any of those 32 studies, or wasn&rsquo;t 
observed and tracked. Similarly, you could analyze dozens of studies of the 
health effects of hiking, but probably none of them would have data about bear 
attacks &mdash; yet bears do attack hikers!BACK TO TEXT</p></li>

<blockquote>  We Canadian neurologists hereby express our strong concern and 
thereby issue this warning to Canadians. The public must be made aware that the 
neurological damage that can result subsequent to upper neck manipulation can 
be debilitating and fatal. We make the following recommendations for the 
attention of the Canadian public, the practitioners of manipulation, the 
medical community, the provincial Ministries of Health and the health care 
professional regulatory bodies. Our concerns are significant. Stroke and death 
due to neck manipulation has been reported in the scientific literature for 
over 50 years. New deaths, in the past few years, have been reported to the 
Canadian Stroke Consortium. The Canadian Stroke Consortium recently published a 
major prospective study. The latest data from the Stroke Consortium indicates 
that &ldquo;more than 100 cases of dissection per year are associated with neck 
manipulation.&rdquo; The resulting stroke and debilitation from such a large 
number is very significant. A recent study by the Institute of Clinical 
Evaluative Sciences (ICES Ontario) indicates that patients with posterior 
circulation strokes under the age of 45 are 5 times more likely than controls 
to have visited a chiropractor within one week of the event. </blockquote> BACK

Meanwhile, suffice it to say that the dominant theory of joint popping depends 
on the concept of &ldquo;cavitation&rdquo; &mdash; the rapid formation and 
explosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid due to pressure changes. The theory 
is full of holes and doesn&rsquo;t begin to explain many features of joint 
popping, in particular the &ldquo;recharge&rdquo; phenomenon, wherein joints 
that supposedly cavitated nicely just a moment ago need to be left alone for 
seconds, minutes or hours before they can cavitate again. Also, the cavitation 
hypothesis does not explain why there is such significant variation between 
individuals and between joints. It is, in short, almost certainly wrong or 
incomplete.BACK TO TEXT</li>

<li>Regardless of how you feel about being &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo;, the 
therapeutic &ldquo;message&rdquo; of a joint wiggle or crack can really only be 
repeated, not significantly modulated: a crack is a crack is a crack, and one 
traction or joint wiggle is pretty much like another. There is only so much 
novel sensory input these techniques can provide. If the body doesn&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;get it&rdquo; after a few tries on a few different days, it&rsquo;s 
probably not going to &ldquo;get it&rdquo; later. This may explains why the 
effectiveness of SMT treatment tends to lessen over time (a well-known 
characteristic of chiropractic therapy). By contrast, I have always been 
grateful for the large number of ways that massage therapy can be used to 
manipulate tissues in the low back, creating a rich variety of fresh sensory 
experiences for clients for an hour at a time, week after week. This is 
certainly one of the advantages of massage therapy as a therapy.BACK TO TEXT

actually on the<em>low end</em> of what I&rsquo;ve heard about chiropractic 
treatment recommendations. For instance, one of my clients was recently told by 
a chiropractor that he could only get relief from back pain if he made a 
commitment to<em>two years of weekly appointments</em> &mdash; at a cost of at 
least $2000! Another client faced down a chiropractor who was demanding that he 
sign a contract for a &ldquo;two-year, $7,000 treatment plan.&rdquo; Such 
prescriptions constitute a serious conflict of interest. Health care 
professionals are ethically obliged to be<em>conservative</em> in their 
treatment recommendations. Clients must be informed and presented with a<em>
range of options</em> and allowed to make their choices with an absolute 
minimum of interference &mdash; not threatened with the consequences of failure 
to adhere to the most expensive therapeutic option available! Especially when 
the condition may be aggravated by the perception that it is problematic! These 
chiropractors were way out of line, and the chiropractic profession must take 
collective responsibility for such blatantly excessive treatment prescriptions.
