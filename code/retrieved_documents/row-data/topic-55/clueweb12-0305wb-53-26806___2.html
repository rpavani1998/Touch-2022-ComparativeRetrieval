<p>Physical therapy is an important and useful treatment option for kyphosis. 
It's especially useful for cases of postural kyphosis because a physical 
therapist can help you learn how to correct your posture and strengthen your 
spinal muscles. However, physical therapy may also be recommended for patients 
with structural kyphosis, includingScheuermann's kyphosis and kyphosis caused 
by spinal fractures.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapy for Postural Kyphosis </strong><br>
 Poor posture 
can lead to kyphosis, but there is encouraging news: It's usually possible to 
correct the spinal curve&hellip;with a bit of work on the patient's part. This 
is where a physical therapist comes in. For most people with postural kyphosis, 
bad posture feels right, so they need to re-learn how to sit, stand, and move.
</p> 
<p>A physical therapist will be able to teach patients how to consciously 
improve their posture; he or she will help you learn what good posture feels 
like. A physical therapist can also help you strengthen your spinal muscles, or 
what doctors call your paravertebral muscles: the muscles that attach to your 
spine and support it. Oftentimes in postural kyphosis, these muscles aren't 
doing their job very well. A physical therapist will teach you exercises and 
stretches to work on these crucial muscles. Once they start to support the 
spine better, you'll be less likely to have poor posture. Strengthening your 
spinal muscles may help reduce your pain, too, because the muscles won't be 
overworked.</p>  You may be interested in these related articles:

<p><strong>Physical Therapy for Scheuermann's Kyphosis </strong><br>
 Physical 
therapy is often used at the same time as bracing. Because the brace supports 
so much of the spine, some believe that wearing the brace can weaken the 
muscles. To avoid this, you may have to go to physical therapy. Otherwise, when 
the brace comes off, the muscles may not be able to support the spine very 
well, and the spine may still curve too much.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>The physical therapist will also help you with your flexibility and range 
of motion (how well your joints move). Many patients with Scheuermann's 
kyphosis also have very tight hamstring muscles (muscles on the back of your 
upper leg). Physical therapy can help alleviate those tight muscles, too, as 
you work on increasing the flexibility of the hamstrings.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Therapy for Kyphosis Caused by Spinal Fractures </strong>
<br> Physical therapy won't correct the kyphotic curve caused by spinal 
fractures, but to prevent more fractures, it may be useful for you to learn 
good (or better) posture. A physical therapist can also help you strengthen 
your spinal muscles so that your spine is better supported&mdash;taking some of 
the weight and pressure off your vertebrae.</p> 
<p>A physical therapist can also help you learn safe exercises for kyphosis. 
Exercise is important to bone health, so a PT can work with you to develop an 
exercise plan that may involve weight-bearing exercises (such as walking or 
tennis) and strengthening exercises (such as weight lifting). The exercise plan 
will be created just for you, taking into account your bone health, health 
history, and physical abilities.</p>  Updated on: 11/21/11
