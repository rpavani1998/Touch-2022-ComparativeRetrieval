<h1>Back Pain Physical Therapy</h1> 
<h3>Back Pain Physical Therapy</h3> 
<p><strong>Physical therapy </strong>is a widely used treatment for back pain 
but is often not enough to make the underlying changes necessary to solve the 
problem. There are many different forms of physical therapy which a 
chiropractic office refers to as &ldquo;physiotherapy&rdquo; in Texas. Acutely, 
the doctor or therapist may focus on decreasing pain with passive physical 
therapy. The exercise ball &ndash; also called a Swiss ball or physio ball 
&ndash; is a conservative treatment option for back pain sufferers and is 
designed to help prevent further episodes of low back pain as part of a 
rehabilitation program.</p> 
<p>Treatment at <strong>Southwest Spine Center</strong> combines the best of 
all available therapy including<strong>spinal decompression, traditional and 
modern chiropractic adjustments, low level or cold light laser therapy by 
Erchonia, massage therapy and trigger point work, acupuncture and physiotherapy 
such as electric muscle stimulation (EMS), intersegmental traction (IST), heat, 
ice, ultrasound, muscle-release techniques, percussion</strong> and more 
without the use of drugs, injections or surgery. Southwest Spine Center will 
take the next step with you and help you increase your flexibility, strengthen 
your muscles and improve your posture and balance as well. Our customized and 
thorough treatments typically help to prevent the pain from coming back.</p>
