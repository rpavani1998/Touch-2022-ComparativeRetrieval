<h2>The Vicious Cycle of An Injury</h2> 
<p><em>by</em> Dr. Ken</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Have you ever wondered why some physical problems never seem to get better? 
Perhaps you have an injury that has become &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;. &nbsp; 
&nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; back&hellip; or a stiff neck&hellip; 
or a sore shoulder. &nbsp;Whatever it is, you know that something&rsquo;s 
wrong. &nbsp;You should be feeling better by now. &nbsp;You would love to get 
out and enjoy the Spring weather. &nbsp;Or start going to the gym. &nbsp;Or 
begin that new exercise class.But you hurt too much. &nbsp;So why isn&rsquo;t 
your body healing normally? &nbsp;Some days you feel like there&rsquo;s an 
improvement, but then the pain is back again. &nbsp;Why?</p> 
<p>I put together the simple diagram at the top of this post to help you 
understand why.&nbsp;The diagram describes a concept called &ldquo;The Vicious 
Cycle of Injury or Trauma&rdquo;. &nbsp;This diagram explains the process of an 
injury and the reasons why you may not be healing properly.</p> 
<p>The top of the diagram is where things begin. &nbsp;Your injury may be 
mild, severe, or somewhere in between. &nbsp;But whatever your injury, cellular 
death occurs at the tissue level. &nbsp;Muscle fibers tear, ligaments stretch, 
discs bulge, etc.</p> 
<p>Going clockwise, the next circle shows that your injury results in pain, 
inflammation, and spasm:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pain is your body&rsquo;s &ldquo;alarm system&rdquo; letting you know that 
your body has passed it&rsquo;s limit.</li> 
<li>Inflammation is your body&rsquo;s response to the damaged tissue. 
&nbsp;Inflammation is the beginning of the healing process.</li> 
<li>Spasm (uncontrolled muscle tightening) is your body&rsquo;s way of putting 
a &ldquo;natural splint&rdquo; on the area to prevent further injury.</li> </ul>
<p>Next you suffer a loss of range of motion. &nbsp;Examples of how this could 
manifest include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Low back stiffness in the morning.</li> 
<li>A tight neck while in the car.</li> 
<li>An inability to reach behind yourself and scratch your back.</li> </ul> 
<p>Any of your joints can suffer a loss of motion if there&rsquo;s local 
swelling, pain, or muscle spasm. When you have a loss of normal motion for some 
time, two things happen:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Your muscles will shrink and weaken (atrophy).</li> 
<li>Adhesions (tough patch-up tissue) will develop in and around the injured 
area.</li> </ul> 
<p>Unfortunately, chronic pain results in fatty infiltration into the 
supporting muscles. &nbsp;You can get a sense of this by inspecting a cheap cut 
of meat. &nbsp;The marbling of fat is the &ldquo;fatty infiltration&rdquo; into 
the muscle. &nbsp;The tough gristle areas are the adhesions that can develop in 
and around your muscles.</p> 
<p>When you suffer a loss of motion, adhesions and spasm, your normal blood 
flow will be restricted. &nbsp;Limited blood flow means that your injured site 
is receiving less oxygen and less nutrition than normal. &nbsp;This leads to 
more tissue death, and the cycle starts all over again.</p> 
<p>So how can you get out of this cycle if you feel you&rsquo;re trapped?</p> 
<p>It all starts with coming in to our center for a visit. &nbsp;After a 
thorough exam, I will develop a reasonable wellness strategy to help you break 
the cycle. &nbsp;Always remember that physical problems can be best fixed with 
physical solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chiropractic care</li> 
<li>Massage therapy techniques</li> 
<li>Trigger point therapy</li> 
<li>Laser therapy</li> 
<li>Weight loss techniqes</li> 
<li>Rehabilitative exercises</li> </ul> 
<p>Please understand that we can&rsquo;t make you heal, but we can ensure that 
as you heal, you&rsquo;ll heal more perfectly.</p> 
<p>In your care, we&rsquo;ll use natural techniques to &ldquo;attack&rdquo; 
each area of the Vicious Cycle. &nbsp;We have found that the combination of 
natural therapies works the best to break the vicious cycle because we target 
multiple points of the cycle at once.</p> 
<p>With the help of natural therapies we can:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduce your pain, inflammation and spasm</li> 
<li>Improve your range of motion</li> 
<li>Restore muscle strength and endurance</li> 
<li>Reduce adhesions and trigger points</li> 
<li>Improve blood flow to your tissues</li> </ul> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re in pain due to a big or little injury, don&rsquo;t ignore 
the problem. &nbsp;It is critical that healing start as soon as possible. 
&nbsp;By getting treatment early, you can prevent abnormal chronic pain 
patterns from taking root.</p> 
<p>With natural therapies you can finally be free of your pain and be the best 
you can be.</p> <br>

<h2>Shoulder Pain</h2> 
<p><em>by</em> Dr. Ken</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>How Common Are Shoulder Problems?</h3> 
<p>Shoulder pain is a common complaint that is often associated with neck pain 
and upper back pain.&nbsp; The only complaint we see more frequently in our 
office is low back pain.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 
13.7 million people in the United States sought medical care in 2003 for 
shoulder problems.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>When you think of shoulder injuries, you probably think of sports-related 
injuries seen in baseball or tennis. &nbsp; However, shoulder injuries can be 
easily caused by many normal everyday activities. The shoulder is so&nbsp; 
susceptible&nbsp;to injury because it has the greatest range of motion of all 
the joints of the body.&nbsp; And with increased motion, you have less 
stability.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the incredible design of the shoulder itself and to 
understand the complexities in caring for shoulder problems we have to first 
take a look at the basic anatomy of the shoulder.&nbsp; The shoulder consists 
of three major bones and over twenty different muscles.</p> 
<h3>Basic Shoulder Anatomy</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The two main bones of the shoulder are the humerus and the scapula 
(shoulder blade). &nbsp;The joint cavity us cushioned by articular cartilage 
covering the head of the humerus and face of the glenoid.&nbsp; The scapula 
extends up around the shoulder joint at the rear to form the roof called the 
acromion, and around the shoulder joint at the front to form the coracoid 
process. &nbsp;The end of the scapula, called the glenoid, meets the head of 
the humerus to form a glenohumeral cavity that acts as a flexible 
ball-and-socket joint. &nbsp;A ring of fibrous cartilage surrounding the 
glenoid is called the labrum, which stabilizes the joint. &nbsp;Ligaments 
connect bones of the shoulder and tendons join the bones to the surrounding 
muscles.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Two major tendons of the shoulder are the biceps tendon, which attaches the 
biceps muscle to the shoulder and helps stabilize the joint, and the 
supraspinatus tendon, which helps form the rotator cuff. &nbsp;Four short 
muscles originate on the scapula and pass around the shoulder where their 
tendons fuse together to form the rotator cuff.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Other major muscles that make up the shoulder girdle are the deltoids, the 
biceps, the triceps, the pectoralis, the rhomboid, the trapezius, the latisimus 
dorsi, the teres major, the levator scapula, and others.</p> 
<p>All of these anatomical components, along with the muscles of your upper 
body, work together to manage the stress your shoulder receives as you lift, 
extend, flex, and throw.</p> 
<h3>Common Shoulder Problems</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Tendonitis</strong>:&nbsp; Inflammation of a tendon.&nbsp; 
Commonly affecting the biceps tendon at the front of the shoulder.&nbsp;<em>
Symptoms include painful shoulder motion and increased pain at night.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Rotator Cuff Strain or Rupture</strong>:&nbsp; Injury to the 
muscle and tendon that covers, rotates, and raises the shoulder.&nbsp;<em>
Symptoms include shoulder pain and difficulty raising the shoulder.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Impingement Syndrome: </strong>Rubbing and clicking of the 
shoulder on overhead motions.&nbsp; The ball of the shoulder joint rubs against 
the ledge (the Acromium) over the shoulder.&nbsp; It is frequently associated 
with tendonitis and rotator cuff problems.&nbsp;<em>Symptoms include pain 
during movement of shoulder and increased pain when raising shoulder 
approaching 90 degrees.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Subluxations: </strong>Bones shifting from their normal place and 
becoming &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;.&nbsp;<em>Symptoms include joint stiffness and 
weakness. Pain may or may not be present.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Bursitis: </strong>Inflamed bursa sack.&nbsp; <em>Symptoms include 
painful to the front or side of the shoulder and pain at night.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Myofascial Pain: </strong>Muscle inflammation involving any of the 
shoulder muscles.&nbsp;<em>Symptoms include local and/or referred pain in the 
shoulder, the upper back, the neck, the head, the shoulder blade area, or in 
the arm.</em></li> 
<li><strong>Nerve Irritation: </strong>Inflamed or irritated nerves 
originating from cervical spine or the brachial plexus.&nbsp;<em>Symptoms 
include shoulder pain, neck pain, arm pain, shooting or burning pain traveling 
from neck to shoulder, to arm, and to the hand.</em></li> </ul> 
<h3>Our Approach To Shoulder Problems</h3> 
<p>First we would start with a thorough case history, consultation, and 
examination.&nbsp; I may recommend diagnostic studies (x-ray or MRI) if I need 
more information.&nbsp;At this point, if I determine that care is appropriate 
and you decide to begin care, I will design a treatment plan for you.&nbsp; If 
at any time I discover something beyond the scope of my practice, I won&rsquo;t 
hesitate to contact your primary care provider to discuss a possible referral 
to another healthcare provider.</p> 
<p>We follow a very effective&nbsp; treatment strategy based on the letters 
ASR.&nbsp; They stand for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A &ndash; Adjust (whole-body adjustment techniques)</li> 
<li>S &ndash; Support (spinal pelvic stabilizers and other joint supports)</li>
<li>R &ndash; Rehabilitate (targeted exercise therapy/physical rehab)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>My approach that works so well with the spine can be applied to other 
joints of the body. Virtually every articulation of your skeletal system is 
susceptible to fixations that can impair function and range of motion.&nbsp; We 
have a variety of other treatment options to help you recover quickly and 
completely.&nbsp; Some of our other treatment options could include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Massage therapy</li> 
<li>Laser therapy</li> 
<li>Electrostimulation treatment</li> 
<li>Home TENS unit</li> 
<li>Therapeutic taping</li> 
<li>Targeted rehabilitative exercises for the shoulder</li> 
<li>Exercise modification</li> 
<li>Home exercise program</li> 
<li>Nutritional supplementation and dietary modification</li> </ul> 
<p>We don&rsquo;t want you to have to resort to dangerous medicines, 
injections, or surgery.&nbsp; Our approach is to use chiropractic care and 
other natural therapies (such as massage or rehab exercises) to correct your 
shoulder problem quickly and&nbsp; naturally.</p> <br>

<h2>How Does Laser Therapy Work?</h2> 
<p><em>by</em> Dr. Ken</p> 
<p>I get this question several times a week in the office. My patients tend to 
be a curious lot. Curiosity is good. Especially when it comes to health care. 
Never be afraid to ask your doctor questions about the safety and efficacy of a 
treatment.</p> 
<p>The laser therapy device that we use in the office is a Class IV 
therapeutic laser. It&rsquo;s called the K-Laser. It&rsquo;s not for cosmetic 
purposes&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t cut. Our laser treatments are safe and 
painless.</p> 
<p>We use it in two different ways. First, for pain-relief. We treat injured 
areas directly to aid in the healing process. And second, as an auriculotherapy 
tool to diminish patients&rsquo; chemical cravings. This helps our clients quit 
smoking and/or lose weight.</p> 
<p>Our K-Laser has been proven to bio-stimulate tissue repair and growth. Our 
laser treatment accelerates wound healing, decreases inflammation, reduces 
pain, and lessens scar tissue formation. As a pain management device, our 
K-Laser is a side-effect-free and non-addictive treatment that provides 
dramatic results.</p> 
<p>Click here for more answers to common questions about Laser Therapy.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>Cellular Effects of Laser Therapy</h3>  Cellular effects occur when a 
therapeutic laser light interacts with cells, higher ATP levels are produced 
which then boosts DNA production, this improves cell membrane permeability and 
initiates the release of nitric oxide. These three events then lead to a 
cascade of beneficial effects increasing cellular energy and health. 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>Laser Therapeutic Effects</h3> 
<p>During each painless treatment, laser energy increases circulation, drawing 
water, oxygen, and nutrients to the damaged area. This creates an optimal 
healing environment that reduces inflammation, swelling, muscle spasms, 
stiffness, and pain. As the injured area returns to normal, function is 
restored and pain is relieved.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<h3>K-Laser Class IV Therapy Promotes</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Increased Circulation</li> 
<li>Immune Stimulation</li> 
<li>Muscle Relaxation</li> 
<li>Improved Vascular Activity</li> 
<li>Accelerated Cell Reproduction and Growth</li> 
<li>Stimulation of Nerve Regeneration</li> </ul> 
<h3>Positive Effects of K-Laser on the Body</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Improves and promotes healing</li> 
<li>Reduces pain and spasm</li> 
<li>Increases joint flexibility</li> 
<li>Reduces symptoms of osteoarthritis</li> 
<li>Improves peripheral microcirculation</li> 
<li>Detoxifies and eliminates trigger points</li> 
<li>Advanced pain relief</li> </ul> 
<h3> Benefits to Patient</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Faster patient satisfaction</li> 
<li>Deeper penetration than Class III lasers</li> 
<li>Delivers more laser energy to the target tissues</li> 
<li>Faster treatment time</li> 
<li>Effective treatment in 3-8 minute</li> 
<li>Increased Metabolic Activity</li> </ul> </blockquote> Quoted from

<h2>Family Care &ndash; How Natural Therapy Can Help</h2> 
<p><em>by</em> Dr. Ken</p> 
<p>Natural therapy has been a great help to families for years. Chiropractic, 
massage, exercise and good nutrition can help you and your family attain 
superior health.</p> 
<p>Many patients see me as their family doctor. Making natural therapy a main 
part of your life is wise. The cost of health insurance and health care 
continues to rise. The cost of drugs, surgery and other medical procedures has 
become overwhelming for many. The adverse reactions to drugs is well known and 
has been making front-page news more and more lately.</p> 
<p>Families want safe and natural solutions. More and more people are choosing 
natural therapy first. It&rsquo;s a wise choice.</p> 
<p>Family care at our office can start at the very beginning. Pregnant mothers 
and their babies can greatly benefit from our care. During this period of 
weight gain and hormonal changes, many mother&rsquo;s become very 
uncomfortable. We can help by greatly reducing the stress and body pains common 
at this time. We specialize in natural care for pregnant moms &ndash; using 
gentle chiropractic adjustments and massage. Many of our patients have even 
reported easier births.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to provide natural care for my wife, Laura, through 
four pregnancies. And we&rsquo;ve been blessed with four natural and healthy 
births&hellip; and four healthy and energetic kids.</p> 
<p>Newborns, infants, and children can also benefit from natural therapy. The 
birth process can be a source of physical stress on both mom and baby. This can 
be the cause of our first subluxation (a spinal bone misalignment that causes 
nervous system interference). As children grow they learn to walk, run, jump, 
climb stairs, and ride bikes. In my very own home, I&rsquo;ve seen some of the 
craziest things our kids do. They can be extremely creative&hellip; sometimes 
dangerously creative! Jumping over towers of pillows, bouncing off the couch 
and slamming off a chair and bouncing onto the floor. What fun!</p> 
<p>All of these activities can cause physical damage and pain&hellip; 
sometimes called growing pains. If ignored, these problems usually worsen and 
become more permanent. Correcting the problems while still relatively new is 
wise. I&rsquo;ve been adjusting my kids spines since they were born, and they 
enjoy it.</p> 
<p>After a patient&rsquo;s initial exam and I explain everything that 
I&rsquo;ve found, I&rsquo;m often asked, &ldquo;How could this have happened? 
What caused it?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>My usual answer&hellip; &ldquo;Life.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Life is tough. We are frequently getting &ldquo;beat up&rdquo; in life. 
Physically, mentally, and emotionally. Car accidents, work injuries, and the 
stress and strains of our busy lives can produce all sorts of physical 
problems. The neuromusculoskeletal (nerve, muscle and bone) system is our first 
line of defense and bears most of the stress. Periodic checkups at our office 
can be very helpful to maintain superior health. Many of our patients report 
more energy, less pain, more vitality and better overall health.</p> 
<p>We also welcome seniors in our practice. Seniors want to enjoy their 
retirement and want superior health. Natural therapy just makes sense. As you 
age, your body can need a great deal of attention. We provide gentle and 
relaxing care that is safe for people of all ages.</p> 
<p>Regardless of your age or current health condition, just remember&hellip; 
it&rsquo;s never too late to begin to pursue superior health. The natural 
therapy we provide is good for your health.</p> 
<p>As you personally benefit from natural therapy, you have some new 
responsibilities. Among them is to tell others about your experience. Why not 
start with the ones you love?</p> <br>

<h2>What a Pain</h2> 
<p><em>by</em> Dr. Ken</p> 
<p>With all this talk about pursuing a lifestyle of wellness, I want to 
address the number one reason people consult our office. Pain.</p> 
<p>We, at Spectrum Wellness, accept clients with big pains or little ones. We 
handle acute or chronic conditions. Sport or work-related injuries. Even motor 
vehicle accident injuries. We welcome clients ranging from one end of the 
spectrum to the other.</p> 
<p>What is pain anyway? Does it have a purpose?</p> 
<p>Pain is a warning sign. It&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s way of telling you 
that a limit has been reached. Like a smoke alarm, it&rsquo;s not the alarm 
that&rsquo;s the problem. The alarm has a cause, just like nearly every ache or 
pain has a cause. Some people choose to just cover up the pain instead of 
correcting the true cause. They end up believing that they&rsquo;re totally 
fine because they feel fine. Unfortunately, the problem that lies below the 
surface of the pain still exists.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s your approach to dealing with pain?</p> 
<h4>Drugs?</h4> 
<p>Choosing to numb or cover up the pain with a chemical. Drugs can offer 
temporary relief, but they can&rsquo;t correct structural or functional 
problems &ndash; such as spinal joint dysfunction (subluxation) or muscular 
problems. Just covering up the symptoms of a problem can be dangerous. Imagine 
if you were driving your car and a red flashing light appeared on the 
dashboard. Would it be wise to take a black marker and scribble over the light 
so that it wouldn&rsquo;t shine in your eyes? Also, many drugs have dangerous 
side-effects and also have a long-term toxic effect on the whole body&hellip; 
just check out the back page of a drug advertisement in a magazine.</p> 
<h4>Physical Therapy?</h4> 
<p>Physical therapy is an option that many people choose. However, exercising 
spinal joints that are misaligned is like continuing to drive your car with 
misaligned wheels! Some physical therapy facilities do adjustments like us.more 
than guide patients in an exercise program, but none offer the combination of 
natural therapies that we have.</p> 
<h4>Surgery?</h4> 
<p>This is the most drastic of all measures. Cutting through layers of skin 
and muscle tissue to cut, scrape, fuse, remove or alter body parts. While there 
may be times when surgery makes sense, they are risky. When it comes to 
emergency care, nothing beats Western Medicine. If I had a serious knife wound, 
I wouldn&rsquo;t drop in to a fellow chiropractor&rsquo;s office to get an 
adjustment! I&rsquo;d get to an ER stat. Go to a hospital for sickness 
care&hellip; come to us for health care.</p> 
<h4>Natural Therapy?</h4> 
<p>Even better, Natural therapy is safe. The combination of chiropractic, 
massage and exercise therapy is the wise choice. Our focus is to find and 
correct the underlying cause of your problem.</p> <br>
