<p><b>What Is VAX-D @ CARE MEDICAL CENTER</b></p> 
<p><b>What Is Vax-D<br>
</b>&ldquo;VAX-D&rdquo; stands for vertebral axial 
decompression -- a non-surgical, non-invasive, spinal decompression, medical 
treatment for a number of low back disc conditions, including herniated, 
bulging, ruptured discs, degenerative disc disease, annular tears, sciatica, 
internal disc disruption IDD), and post-operative scar tissue (called 
&ldquo;failed back syndrome&rdquo;).</p> 
<p><b>How Does VAX-D Work<br>
</b>VAX-D is a 30 minute treatment delivered by 
a certified physical therapist, physical therapist assistant, or VAX-D 
technician supervised by&nbsp;one of our doctors or therapists&nbsp;and 
involves a table and a computer. During a treatment, you wear a pelvic girdle, 
and lay on the VAX-D table. The girdle attaches at the foot of the table, and 
you hold on to handles at the head of the table. During a treatment you 
experience a strong, not painful, stretch of your lumbar spine. The stretch 
lasts for a minute; then you rest for a minute; then a stretch for a minute 
&ndash; and it cycles like that, pull/rest, pull/rest, for &frac12; an hour. 
During treatment, intradiscal pressures reduce to negative levels in the range 
of &ndash;100 to &ndash;150 mm Hg. The significantly lowered intradiscal 
pressure creates something like suction within the disc, which then pulls the 
herniation or bulge back into the disc. This suction also pulls fluid and 
nutrient cells into the disc which help to re-hydrate the disc and enables it 
to heal.</p> 
<p><b>Where Did it Come From<br>
</b>VAX-D&reg; was invented in the early 
1980's by Allan Dyer, M.D., Ph D and former Minister of Health in Ontario 
Canada. Dr. Dyer also did the pioneering research that led to the creation of 
the ventricular defibrillator used to get a heart that has stopped to beat 
again.</p> 
<p><b>Is it cleared for marketing by the FDA<br>
</b>Yes. Since 1989 VAX-D has 
been registered as a class 2, non-experimental, medical procedure by the 
Division of Surgical and Rehabilitative Medicine of the FDA. Its 510K 
registration is for &ldquo;decompression of the vertebral discs and facet 
joints, that is, unloading due to distraction and positioning.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><b>Effectiveness Of Vax-D</b></p> 
<p><b><b>How Effective Is It<br>
</b></b>To date there have been fifteen 
publications on VAX-D. Eight are studies published in juried medical journals. 
All report that VAX-D was effective for 75-80% of the patients treated. In most 
cases, chronic low back conditions are resolved within 20-30 
treatments.&nbsp;Our VAX-D treatments may be combined with other non-surgical 
treatments offered at Care Medical Center to improve your results. Many times 
patients will also undergo physical therapy, trigger point therapy, 
electrotherapy, or pain management treatments to speed up your recovery. This 
combination of Vax-D and other in-house therapies to improve your 
condition&nbsp;is only offered at Care Medical Center.</p> 
<p><b>If It Is So Effective, Why Hasn't My Doctor Heard About it<br>
</b>VAX-D 
is a relatively new medical procedure. The therapy has worked for thousands of 
patients, and over 3000 patients per day, worldwide, are now being treated. 
Awareness of VAX-D is growing rapidly as physicians and healthcare providers 
learn about it and the phenomenal results it has achieved. As a result, VAX-D 
is now becoming the standard of care for chronic low back pain.</p> 
<p><b>Injuries That Vax-D treats</b></p> 
<p><b><b>Can Anyone Do VAX-D<br>
</b></b>Almost. You have to qualify 
medically, and the small percentage of people who have the following conditions 
do not:<br>
<br>
&bull; Tumors <br>
&bull; Fractures <br>
&bull; Advanced 
Osteoporosis<br>
&bull; Certain conditions (diseases) that compromise the 
structural integrity of the spine and discs.<br>
<br>
In addition, VAX-D is not 
prescribed for pregnant women.</p> 
<p><b>If I Have Had Surgery Can I Still Have VAX-D<br>
</b>Having back surgery 
does not prevent you from having VAX-D unless you have fixed surgical hardware 
used to fuse the spine. Clinical studies show that VAX-D provides relief for 
patients who have had one or more back surgeries and Failed Back Syndrome.</p> 
<p><b>Vax-D treatment information</b></p> 
<p><b><b>How Often Are The Treatments<br>
</b></b>Treatments are scheduled 3-5 
days a week, and take less than one hour. Our treatment hours are from 9:00 am 
to 6:00pm, making it possible for patients traveling from the suburbs to fit 
treatments into their schedules.</p> 
<p><b>Do Treatments Interfere With Work<br>
</b>Many patients continue being 
fully productive while receiving VAX-D treatments. Studies show that patients 
who do miss work usually return to work more quickly than those treated with 
other types of conservative care or surgery.</p> 
<p><b>Vax-D vs. other treatments</b></p> 
<p><b>What Is The VAX-D Approach To Treating Back Pain<br>
</b>All patients 
are given a careful clinical evaluation and diagnosis, including a review 
and/or analysis of x-rays, MRI&rsquo;s or other films by Board certified 
physicians and physical therapists, in order to achieve a clear diagnosis and 
determine whether or not the patient qualifies for VAX-D treatments.</p> 
<p>Qualified patients are given VAX-D treatments plus any additional necessary 
physical therapy or nutritional support by certified staff, monitored by 
physicians. All patient progress is monitored on a daily basis, and 
re-examinations are given at appropriate times. When necessary, and when 
prescribed by a staff physician, we also use other clinic resources such as 
chiropractic and/or physical therapy interventions and/or modalities. Finally, 
upon successfully completing VAX-D treatments, when necessary, patients are 
taught appropriate exercises by one of our 6 staff physical therapists.</p> 
<p><b>How Is It Different From Traction<br>
</b>The main difference between 
VAX-D and traction is function. VAX-D decompresses the disc by reducing 
intradiscal pressures so low that extruded disc tissue is pulled back into the 
disc. The low intradiscal pressure also causes an infusion of fluid and 
nutrient cells. That is what makes it so effective. VAX-D is the only process 
that has been found in clinical research to lower disc pressure to negative 
levels.</p> 
<p>Studies published on conventional traction, on the other hand, demonstrate 
that pressures within the discs stayed the same, were not lowered and, in some 
instances, were actually elevated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>How Is It Different From Other Similar Devices<br>
</b>There area many 
copy cat devices that claim to be the same as VAX-D but actually are not. They 
go by different names, including: DRX, DRS, Lordex, and Spinex. They are 
traction devices that can stretch the lower back, but they have not 
demonstrated the ability to lower intradiscal pressures. Traction tables have a 
small electric wench that attaches to the head of the table. A rope and pulley 
are then attached to either a cervical device or lumbar belts. Either static or 
intermittent traction modes can be chosen, but neither have been shown to 
reduce intradiscal pressure. Only VAX-D has clinically demonstrated this.</p> 
<p><b>How Does Vax-D Compare with Surgery<br>
</b>For those who can do it, 
VAX-D is better than surgery. The trouble with surgery is that is physically 
alters the spine by removing all or part of the problematic disc. Although this 
can reduce the pressure on the nerve, and relieve the back pain, the surgery 
may place more stress on the healthy discs above and below. Complications from 
surgery can be severe and may result in debilitating conditions. Clinical 
Studies show that VAX-D is not only a safe alternative to surgery, but also 
successful in about 8 out of 10 cases.</p> 
<p><b>Is it the same as Chiropractic<br>
</b>No. VAX-D&reg; is physical 
medicine. While it is within the scope of practice for a chiropractor, it is 
nothing like a chiropractic adjustment and is not considered a chiropractic 
procedure. Physical therapy and nutrition are similarly used. All serve as an 
indication of our commitment to tailoring treatment to the particular needs of 
each patient.</p> <br>
