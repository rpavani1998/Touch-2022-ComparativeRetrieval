<b> STUDY 
DESIGN:</b> &nbsp; A randomized clinical trial.<br>
<br>
<b> OBJECTIVES: </b> 
&nbsp; To compare the effectiveness of medical and chiropractic care for low 
back pain patients in managed care; to assess the effectiveness of physical 
therapy among medical patients; and to assess the effectiveness of physical 
modalities among chiropractic patients.<br>
<br>
<b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
</b> &nbsp; Despite the burden that low back pain places on patients, 
providers, and society, the relative effectiveness of common treatment 
strategies offered in managed care is unknown.<br>
<br>
<b> METHODS: </b> 
&nbsp; Low back pain patients presenting to a large managed care facility from 
October 30, 1995, through November 9, 1998, were randomly assigned in a 
balanced design to medical care with and without physical therapy and to 
chiropractic care with and without physical modalities. The primary outcome 
variables are average and most severe low back pain intensity in the past week, 
assessed with 0 to 10 numerical rating scales, and low back-related disability, 
assessed with the 24-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire.<br>
<br>
<b> 
RESULTS:</b> &nbsp; Of 1,469 eligible patients, 681 were enrolled; 95.7% were 
followed through 6 months. The mean changes in low back pain intensity and 
disability of participants in the medical and chiropractic care-only groups 
were similar at each follow-up assessment (adjusted mean differences at 6 
months for most severe pain, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, -0.32-0.86; average 
pain, 0.22, -0.25-0.69; and disability, 0.75, -0.29-1.79). Physical therapy 
yielded somewhat better 6-month disability outcomes than did medical care alone 
(1.26, 0.20-2.32).<br>
<br>
<b> CONCLUSIONS: </b> &nbsp; After 6 months of 
follow-up, chiropractic care and medical care for low back pain were comparable 
in their effectiveness. Physical therapy may be marginally more effective than 
medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible 
benefit is small.<br>

Discussion</b><br>
<br>
 This is the first randomized clinical trial to address 
the relative effectiveness of primary medical versus chiropractic care and the 
effectiveness of physical therapy or physical modalities for patients with low 
back pain within a managed care practice setting with salaried providers. 
Medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or physical modalities 
yielded similar improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of 
follow-up. Physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care 
alone for reducing disability in some patients after 6 months, but the 
magnitude of this possible benefit is not large. Overall, there are only small 
differences in low back pain outcomes between the treatment groups in this 
population of largely subacute and chronic pain patients.<br>
<br>
 Our study 
is one of many in recent years to compare various treatment approaches for 
patients with low back pain. The authors of review papers and treatment 
guidelines have concluded that acetaminophen, [<b>5,14</b>] NSAIDs, [<b>
5,11,14,28,49</b>] muscle relaxants, [<b>11,49</b>] conditioning exercises and 
certain aerobic activities, [<b>5</b>] and spinal manipulation [<b>5,40</b>] 
may provide shortterm benefit for patients with acute low back pain; NSAIDS, [
<b>49</b>] exercise therapy, [<b>19,49</b>] and spinal manipulation [<b>49</b>] 
may be of some benefit for patients with chronic low back pain. There is little 
evidence to support the use of bedrest for acute pain [<b>5,49</b>] or physical 
agents or modalities for acute [<b>5,36,49</b>] or chronic low back pain. [<b>
36,49</b>] Adverse reactions are much more frequent in patients taking 
medications than in patients receiving nonmedication comparison treatments. [<b>
5,11,28</b>] Side effects and complications resulting from spinal manipulation 
for low back pain are extremely rare. [<b>2,3,40</b>]<br>
<br>
 Four randomized 
controlled trials have compared chiropractic with physical therapy for low back 
pain. No clinically significant differences in outcomes between chiropractic 
and hospital outpatient care were found in the Meade et al [<b>32,33</b>] 
trial. Postacchini et al [<b>38</b>] concluded that acute pain patients were 
better with chiropractic at 3 weeks; chronic patients were better with physical 
therapy at 3 weeks; and there were no differences between groups at 6 months. 
Skargren et al [<b>42,43</b>] reported no differences between chiropractic and 
physical therapy patients at 6 months or 1 year in terms of pain, function, 
cost, or sick leave, although chiropractic was slightly more favorable for 
patients with episodes of less than a week and physical therapy more favorable 
for patients with episodes of more than a month. Cherkin et a [<b>l9</b>] 
reported no differences between chiropractic and McKenzie physical therapy 
groups during 2 years of follow-up in terms of pain and disability, and these 
groups had only slightly better outcomes and much greater costs than did 
patients in the control group receiving only an educational booklet.<br>
<br>
 
A recent randomized clinical trial comparing osteopathic care with standard 
medical care in amanaged care setting found equivalent pain and disability 
outcomes among patients with subacute (3 weeks to 6months) low back pain after 
12 weeks of care, but there was greater prescription medication use in the 
medical care group.1 The authors of a well-designed observational study 
concluded that among patients with low back pain of less than 10 weeks&#146; 
duration seen by primary care physicians, chiropractors, and orthopedic 
surgeons, pain and functional status outcomes were similar at 6 months, and 
costs were higher for patients of orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors. [<b>8
</b>]<br>
<br>
 The findings from prior studies are consistent with our results 
showing relatively small differences between medical, chiropractic, and 
physical therapy care. The slightly better 6-month disability outcomes observed 
for physical therapy patients in our study are consistent with findings 
reported recently from physical therapy intervention studies for subacute and 
chronic low back pain. An intervention with physical therapist-led exercise 
classes was found to be more effective than primary medical care for patients 
with subacute low back pain after 6 and 12 months. [<b>34</b>] In patients with 
chronic pain, physical therapy and medically supervised exercise were found to 
be better than unsupervised exercise in terms of pain intensity, functional 
status, and cost per sick day after 12 months following 3 months of therapy in 
Norway. [<b>48</b>] The greater value of supervised exercise for patients with 
chronic low back pain is also supported by another recent trial that followed 
patients for 2 years. [<b>21</b>] Because many of the medical care with 
physical therapy patients in our study did not receive physical therapy, the 
intention-to-treat analysis may have underestimated the magnitude of this 
effect.<br>
<br>
 Because our study was conducted within one managed care 
organization, generalization of our findings to patients in other settings 
should be viewed with caution. Medical providers, chiropractors, and physical 
therapists outside this network may differ in their approaches to low back pain 
care; and patients under fee-for-service, workers&#146; compensation, personal 
injury, and other reimbursement models may differ in ways that affect treatment 
outcomes. Also, patients who chose not to be randomly assigned may differ from 
participants on factors that modify treatment effects. Nevertheless, our study 
population is similar to other outpatient low back pain populations in terms of 
average baseline level of back pain [<b>9,29,30</b>] and baseline level of 
disability resulting from back pain. [<b>7,29,39,44,47</b>] However, 
differences on other unmeasured factors and treatment effects that may be 
relatively larger in certain patient subgroups could potentially limit the 
study&#146;s generalizability.<br>
<br>
 Chiropractors at the study site use 
the same general type of spinal manipulation taught in most chiropractic 
schools and used by most chiropractors in the United States. [<b>10,12</b>] The 
medical providers prescribe NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and narcotic analgesics, 
which is the typical treatment approach used by primary care physicians for 
patients with low back pain. [<b>11,14</b>] The physical therapists emphasize 
therapeutic exercise and other active care strategies, rather than passive 
methods that are de-emphasized in modern physical therapy training and 
practice. [<b>22</b>] The active approach used by the physical therapy staff 
may be responsible for the relatively better 6-month disability outcomes 
experienced by the physical therapy patients. Findings from a national network 
of physical therapy practices showed that the combination of modalities and 
exercise is the most frequently used treatment strategy for patients with 
lumbar impairments. [<b>27</b>] Although this study also showed managed care 
and fee-for-service reimbursement do not appreciably affect utilization 
patterns, [<b>27</b>] an earlier survey of physical therapists demonstrated 
differences in treatment preferences and visit frequency by practice setting. [

<br>
<b>Conclusion </b><br>
<br>
 Medical and chiropractic 
care without physical therapy or physical modalities yielded similar 
improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of follow-up. The 
findings suggest that physical therapy patients may have greater reductions in 
disability, on average, than do patients in the medical care-only group from 6 
weeks to 6 months, resulting in relatively better 6-month disability outcomes; 
however, these small differences may be chance findings and may not persist 
with continued follow- up. Assessment of the costs and potential risks 
associated with each treatment strategy would be helpful in more fully 
understanding the roles of medical providers, chiropractors, and physical 
therapists in the treatment of low back pain.<br>
