 Latest Update on 
Fibromyalgia<br>

<h1>Physical Therapy in Los Altos for Fibromyalgia</h1> 
<p><em>I hurt all over</em>. <em>I feel like a truck ran over me when I wake 
up in the morning</em>. These are the most common complaints of patients 
suffering from a condition known as<em>fibromyalgia</em>. In addition to 
widespread pain, patients with fibromyalgia also report a wide range of other 
symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, depression, stiffness, 
and mental fog to name just a few.</p> 
<p>Patients with fibromyalgia feel sensations like touch and temperature (hot 
and cold)<em>louder and longer</em> than people who don't have fibromyalgia. 
Normal sensations feel uncomfortable or even painful to them. And the awareness 
of those sensations lasts longer than in other folks.</p> 
<p>Twenty years ago, fibromyalgia was recognized by the <em>American College 
of Rheumatology</em> (ACR) as a real biologic problem and not just an imagined 
or psychologic disorder. That brought an increased attention to this condition. 
Since then, many studies have been done to understand the underlying basis for 
the problem and to find a way to effectively treat it.</p> 
<p>In this report, two physicians from the University of Pittsburgh School of 
Medicine present an in-depth update on the latest findings in the diagnosis and 
treatment of fibromyalgia. Let's start with what causes it. In a nutshell, we 
still don't know. The pathology has been narrowed down to an abnormal 
processing of pain signals. It appears that the entire nervous system and its 
connections to other systems is involved.</p> 
<p>Studies have shown there are neuroendocrine, biochemical, and genetic 
abnormalities. But not all fibromyalgia patients have the same symptoms, 
responses to pain or other stimuli, genetic links, or altered hormones. So, 
finding one treatment that will be equally effective for everyone remains a 
challenge.</p> 
<p>Stress seems to have a role in fibromyalgia. Symptoms are certainly 
aggravated or made worse by emotional, psychologic, or physical stress. There's 
some evidence that communication between the hypothalamus, pituitary, and 
adrenal glands is altered in patients with fibromyalgia. The proper functioning 
of these three areas is essential to a normal response to stress that doesn't 
lead to physiologic dysfunction.</p> 
<p>Most experts agree that a combined approach using medications, cognitive 
and behavioral therapy, exercise, and complementary approaches is best. This 
mode of treatment is referred to as<em>multidisciplinary</em> or <em>
interdisciplinary</em>. Scientists are still working to identify what form of 
treatment, in what order, and combined with what other treatments results in 
the most favorable outcomes.</p> 
<p>Physicians are advised to listen to the patient's report of symptoms and 
choose treatments that will reduce (or eliminate) the most bothersome ones 
first. So far, studies have shown that exercise is a key therapy for everyone. 
Too much, too soon can aggravate symptoms. Patients are carefully guided by a 
Physical Therapist through a progressive but individualized program of strength 
training, endurance, and flexibility.</p> 
<p>Exercise is combined with medications, cognitive-behavioral therapy, 
acupuncture or hypnotherapy, and biofeedback/relaxation training. If these 
methods don't help (or don't help enough), then the patient may want to try 
chiropractic care, massage therapy, or Physical Therapy modalities such as 
ultrasound or electrical stimulation.</p> 
<p>There are several different types of medications used with fibromyalgia 
patients. Most of these work at the level of the nervous system to alter pain 
signals. These include antidepressants, antiepileptics, analgesics (pain 
relievers), and sometimes muscle relaxants. It may take some time to find the 
right drug in the most effective dose to calm symptoms without adding unwanted 
side effects. The use of vitamin supplements, hormones, herbs, and thyroid 
medication are under investigation.</p> 
<p>Whatever treatment approach is taken, patients must be questioned about 
results to measure a response to treatment. For example, surveys of pain levels 
(frequency, intensity, and duration) and assessment of tender points are often 
used to measure outcomes.</p> 
<p>Most treatment is by trial and error. If the chosen treatment isn't having 
the desired effect(s), then something else can be tried. Any reduction in 
global pain score and tender points is a step in the right direction. Improved 
mood, better sleep patterns, fewer headaches, and improved quality of life are 
all much appreciated by these patients.</p>
