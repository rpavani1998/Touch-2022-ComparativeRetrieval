&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it may be 
easier to teach anatomy by dividing the body into arbitrary parts, a 
misinterpretation can be created. For instance, we find clinically that the 
lumbar spine, sacrum, ilia, pubic bones, and hips work as a functional unit. 
Any disorder of one part immediately affects the function of the other parts. 
We should also keep in mind that an axial kinematic chain of weight-supporting 
segments extends from the occipital base to the soles of the feet. Because the 
number of professional papers concerning the cause and diagnosis of low-back 
pain is voluminous, emphasis herein is placed on points that the author 
believes are important but not often emphasized in popular literature.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general 
stability of synovial joints is established by action of surrounding muscles. 
Excessive joint stress results in strained muscles and tendons and sprained or 
ruptured ligaments and capsules. When stress is chronic, degenerative changes 
occur. The lining of synovial joints is slightly phagocytic, is regenerative if 
damaged, and secretes synovial fluid that is a nutritive lubricant having 
bacteriostatic and anticoagulant characteristics. This anticoagulant effect may 
result in poor callus formation in intra-articular fractures where the fracture 
line is exposed to synovial fluid. Synovial versus mechanical causes of joint 
pain are shown in Table 1.<br>

 Low back pain (LBP) affects approximately 80% of adults at some 
time in life [<b>1</b>] and occurs in all ages [<b>2, 3</b>]. Despite billions 
being spent on various diagnostic and treatment approaches, the prevalence and 
disability related to LBP has continued to increase [<b>4</b>]. There has been 
a recent movement toward comparative effectiveness research [<b>5</b>], i.e., 
research that determines which treatment approaches are most effective for a 
given patient population. In addition, there is increased recognition of the 
importance of practice-based research which generates data in a &#147;real 
world&#148; environment as a tool for conducting comparative effectiveness 
research [<b>6, 7</b>]. This movement calls for greater participation of 
private practice environments in clinical research [<b>7</b>]. <br>

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care 
and accounts for over 3.7 million physician visits per year in the United 
States alone. Ninety percent of adults will experience LBP in their lifetime, 
50% will experience recurrent back pain, and 10% will develop chronic pain and 
related disability [<b>1-4</b>]. According to the most recent national survey 
more than 18 million Americans over the age of 18 years received manipulative 
therapies in 2007 at a total annual out of pocket cost of $3.9 billion with 
back pain being the most common clinical complaint of these individuals [<b>5

 Little has been published on the effects of Cox flexion distraction 
manipulation (Fig 1) on pain experienced in patients who previously underwent 
lumbar spinal surgery. The results of this study demonstrate that postsurgical 
patients with subsequent low back pain seem to respond positively to Cox 
flexion distraction manipulation treatments. These results are similar to 
previous case reports in terms of their positive outcomes; however, the data 
included in this article stratify treatment results based on surgical type and 
include a much larger sample size than previously documented.<br>

 This systematic review of the 
cost-effectiveness of treatments endorsed in the APS-ACP guidelines found that 
spinal manipulation was cost-effective for subacute and chronic low back pain, 
as were other methods usually within the chiropractor&#146;s scope of practice 
(interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, and acupuncture). For acute low 
back pain, this review found insufficient evidence for reaching a conclusion 
about the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation. It also found no evidence 
at all on the cost-effectiveness of medication for low back pain.<br>

 Mechanical low back pain is 
a common indication for Nuclear Medicine imaging. Whole-body bone scan is a 
very sensitive but poorly specific study for the detection of metabolic bone 
abnormalities. The accurate localisation of metabolically active bone disease 
is often difficult in 2D imaging but single photon emission computed 
tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) allows accurate diagnosis and 
anatomic localisation of osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions in 3D imaging. We 
present a clinical case of a patient referred for evaluation of chronic lower 
back pain with no history of trauma, spinal surgery, or cancer. Planar 
whole-body scan showed heterogeneous tracer uptake in the lumbar spine with 
intense localization to the right lateral aspect of L3. Integrated SPECT/CT of 
the lumbar spine detected active bone metabolism in the right L3/L4 facet joint 
in the presence of minimal signs of degenerative osteoarthrosis on CT images, 
while a segment demonstrating more gross degenerative changes was quiescent 
with only mild tracer uptake. The usefulness of integrated SPECT/CT for 
anatomical and functional assessment of back pain opens promising opportunities 
both for multi-disciplinary clinical assessment and treatment for manual 
therapists and for research into the effectiveness of manual therapies.<br>

 Several RCTs have been conducted to assess the efficacy of 
SMT for acute LBP using various methods. Results from most studies suggest that 
5 to 10 sessions of SMT administered over 2 to 4 weeks achieve equivalent or 
superior improvement in pain and function when compared with other commonly 
used interventions, such as physical modalities, medication, education, or 
exercise, for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up. Spine care 
clinicians should discuss the role of SMT as a treatment option for patients 
with acute LBP who do not find adequate symptomatic relief with self-care and 
education alone.<br>

Recommendations for assessment of LBP emphasized the importance of ruling out 
potentially serious spinal pathology, specific causes of LBP, and neurologic 
involvement, as well as identifying risk factors for chronicity and measuring 
the severity of symptoms and functional limitations, through the history, 
physical, and neurologic examination. Recommendations for management of acute 
LBP emphasized patient education, with short-term use of acetaminophen, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or<b>spinal manipulation therapy</b>. For 
chronic LBP, the addition of back exercises, behavioral therapy, and short-term 
opioid analgesics was suggested.<br>

There is a lack of evidence-based support for the efficacy of complex fusion 
surgeries over conservative surgical decompression for elderly stenosis 
patients. There is, however, a significant financial incentive to both 
hospitals and surgeons to perform the complex fusions. Spinal stenosis is the 
most frequent cause for spinal surgery in the elderly. There has been a slight 
decrease in these surgeries between 2002 and 2007. However, there has also been 
an overall 15 fold increase in the more complex spinal fusions (360 degree 
spine fusions). Deyo et. al. in yesterday&#146;s issue (April 7, 2010) of the 
Journal of the American Medical Association concludes that &#147;It is unclear 
why more complex operations are increasing. It seems implausible that the 
number of patients with the most complex spinal pathology increased 15-fold in 
just 6 years. The introduction and marketing of new surgical devices and the 
influence of key opinion leaders may stimulate more invasive surgery, even in 
the absence of new indications&#133;financial incentives to hospitals and 
surgeons for more complex procedures may play a role&#133;&#148; There is a 
significant difference in mean hospital costs for simple decompression versus 
complex surgical fusion. The cost of decompression is $23,724 compared to an 
average of $80,888 for complex fusion. Despite the much higher cost, there is 
no evidence of superior outcomes and there is greater morbidity associated with 
the complex fusion. The surgeon is typically reimbursed only $600 to $800 for 
simple decompression and approximately ten times more, $6,000 to $8,000 for the 
complex fusion.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best available 
evidence currently suggests that in the absence of serious spinal pathology, 
nonspinal causes, or progressive or severe neurologic deficits, the management 
of chronic LBP should focus on patient education, self-care, common analgesics, 
and back exercises. Short-term pain relief may be obtained from spinal 
manipulative therapy or acupuncture. For patients with psychological 
comorbidities, adjunctive analgesics, behavioral therapy, or multidisciplinary 
rehabilitation also may be appropriate. Given the importance of active 
participation in recovery, patient preference should be sought to help select 
from among the recommended treatment options.<br>

 As much or more evidence 
exists for the use of spinal manipulation to reduce symptoms and improve 
function in patients with chronic LBP as for use in acute and subacute LBP. Use 
of exercise in conjunction with manipulation is likely to speed and improve

 Although chronic low back pain (cLBP) is increasingly 
recognized as a complex syndrome with multifactorial etiology, the pathogenic 
mechanisms leading to the development of chronic pain in this condition remain 
poorly understood. We hypothesize that pain-related fear leads to a cycle of 
decreased movement, connective tissue remodeling, inflammation, nervous system 
sensitization and further decreased mobility. In addition to providing a new, 
testable framework for future mechanistic studies of cLBP, the integration of 
connective tissue and nervous system plasticity into the model will potentially 
illuminate the mechanisms of a variety of treatments that may reverse these 
abnormalities by applying mechanical forces to soft tissues (e.g. physical 
therapy, massage, chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture), by changing specific 
movement patterns (e.g. movement therapies, yoga) or more generally by 
increasing activity levels (e.g. recreational exercise).<b>You will also enjoy

<b>The outcomes showed that a high percentage of those who had LBP in 1994

used to examine associations between hormonal and reproductive factors 
(independent variables) and, respectively, chronic LBP, chronic UEP (upper 
extremity pain) and combined chronic LBP/UEP.<b>Past pregnancy, young maternal 
age at first birth, duration of oral contraceptive use, and use of estrogens 
during menopause were associated with chronic LBP</b>, while young age at 
menarche was associated with chronic UEP. Irregular or prolonged menstruation

<b> End Medical 
Mis-Management of LBP</b> <br>

<p> The medical &quot;debate&quot; has been going on for years...is spinal 
adjusting (a.k.a manipulation) effective for Low Back Pain?<b>The original 
Meade study (British Medical Journal 1990) demonstrated that chiropractic was 
much more effective for LBP than conventional medical care</b>.<br>
<br>
 In 
1993 the province of Ontario, Canada hired the esteemed health care economist 
Pran Manga, PhD to examine the benefits of chiropractic care for low back pain (
<b>LBP</b>) and to make a set of recommendations on how to contain and reduce 
health care costs. His report<b>A Study to Examine the Effectiveness and 
Cost-Effectiveness of Chiropractic Management of Low-Back Pain</b> cited 
research demonstrating that: (1) chiropractic manipulation is safer than 
medical management for LBP; &nbsp; (2) that spinal manipulation is less safe 
and effective when performed by non-chiropractic professionals; &nbsp; (3) that 
there is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that chiropractic 
management of low-back pain is more cost-effective than medical management; 
&nbsp; (4) and that<b>there would be highly significant cost savings if more 
management of LBP was transferred from medical physicians to chiropractors</b>. 
<b> He also stated that</b> &quot;<b>A very good case can be made for making 
chiropractors the gatekeepers for management of low-back pain in the Workers' 
Compensation System in Ontario.</b>&quot;<br>
<br>
 In 1994 Medicine was 
horrified when the<b>Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR)</b> 
confirmed the untested, questionable or harmful nature of many current medical 
therapies for LBP , and also stated that, of all forms of management they 
reviewed, only chiropractic care could both reduce pain AND improve function.
<br> <br>
 In 1995, Meade did a follow-up to his 1990 BMJ article, again 
publishing in the<b>British Medical Journal</b>. It demonstrated that those 
treated by chiropractic derive more benefit and long term satisfaction than 
those treated by hospitals,<b>especially for those who suffered from chronic 
(or long-term) low back pain</b>!<br>
<br>
 A recent study in <b>SPINE Journal
</b> reveals that health care expenditures for back pain sufferers was a 
staggering<b>$90.7 billion</b> in 1998, and that <b>prescription drugs 
accounted for more than 15% of that figure</b>! This is alarming, since <b>
muscle relaxants have been associated with slower recovery rates</b>, and <b>
steroid injections offer minimal relief</b>. &nbsp; One needs to ask why drug 
costs continue to climb with a track record like that? Even care by<b>physical 
therapists</b> has been shown to prolong recovery from low back pain.<br>
<br>
 
A chronic pain study at the University of Washington School of Medicine 
recently compared which<b>treatments were most effective at reducing pain for 
neuromuscular diseases</b> and found that <b>chiropractic scored the highest 
pain relief rating</b> (7.33 out of 10), <b>scoring higher than the relief 
provided by either nerve blocks</b> (6.75) <b>or opioid analgesics</b> (6.37).
<br> <br>
 A recent <b>4-year retrospective study of 700,000 health plan members
</b> revealed that offering chiropractic services within a managed-care 
environment could save insurers 27% in back pain episode-related costs! The<b>
Cost-effectiveness Page</b> documents many other studies with similar findings.
<br> <br>
 In December 2004, the <b>British Medical Research Council</b> 
published 2 papers in the<i>British Medical Journal</i> demonstrating both the 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic compared with medical 
management.<b>These two papers revealed:</b><br>
<br>
<b>&#149;</b> Spinal 
Manipulation, with or without exercise, improved symptoms more than medical 
care did at both 3 and 12 months. .<br>
<br>
<b>&#149;</b> The authors 
concluded: &#147;We believe that this is the first study of physical therapy 
for low back pain to show convincingly that both manipulation alone and 
manipulation followed by exercise provide cost effective additions to care in 
general practice.&#148;<br>
<br>
 The most recent in a long line of articles 
showing the clear superiority of chiropractic management was<b>published in May 
of 2007</b> . Clinical and cost utilization based on 70,274 member-months over 
a 7-year period<b>demonstrated decreases of 60.2% in-hospital admissions, 59.0% 
less hospital days, 62.0% less outpatient surgeries and procedures, and 83% 
less pharmaceutical costs</b> when compared with conventional medicine IPA 
performance.<br>
<br>
 That is rather significant savings, is it not? <br>
<br>

So...what's the holdup?</p> <br>

who has not endured pregnancy or has not been pregnant for an extended period

<b> End Medical Mis-Management of 
Musculoskeletal Complaints </b> <b><br>
 Q. &nbsp; Are medical doctors well 
trained to diagnose or treat musculoskeletal complaints?<br>
<br>
 A. &nbsp; 
Read the unsettling answer in this series of articles</b> 
<p> Chiropractors pride themselves in their ability to diagnose and manage 
neuro-musculo-skeletal (NMS) complains. According to all the surveys, this is 
our bread and butter, and no one on the planet is better trained to diagnose 
(locate) and treat (correct) neck, low back, or peripheral joint (knee, elbow 
etc) complaints. But, don't just take my word for it. Read on.<br>

Orthopedic surgeons are supposed to be the *gods* of medicine, the pinnacle of 
medical knowledge. First they become MDs, then rotate through a variety of 
specialties, and finally take residence in a highly competitive orthopedic 
program. You may want to review this<b>interesting description of the 
requirements</b> for the UCLA Orthopedic Surgery's Residency Program.<br>
<br>

<b>The following is a long and sad tale about the weakness of modern medical 
education</b>. This series of articles were all mostly published in the 
prestigious<i>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery</i>, the Number One journal for 
orthopedic surgeons.<br>
<br>
 In 1998, two medical doctors at the University 
of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, contacted all 157 
chairpersons of orthopedic residency programs in the United States. Together 
they developed and validated a<b>basic-competency examination in 
musculoskeletal medicine</b> to give to the first year residents. The results 
were astounding, because<b>82% of the eighty-five medical school graduates 
failed this BASIC competency exam!</b><br>
<br>
 Four years later they <b>
redesigned the exam and again gave it to all the residents</b>. Even though the 
passing grade was LOWERED from 74% to 70%,<b>78% of them again failed the exam, 
with a mean test score average of 59.9 percent. Isn't that frightening?</b><br>

<br> To add insult to injury, <b>this exact same test was given to a group of 
51 chiropractic students</b> during their last semester of schooling. The 
results? 70% of the students passed the test. This is in contrast to an 80% 
failure rate for the MDs.<br>
<br>
<b>For clarity sake, you need appreciate the 
difference between the chiropractic and the medical participants in these 
studies</b>. <br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The chiropractic group were still JUST STUDENTS in their last undergrad 
year<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>The medical group had already graduated medical school, been awarded their 
MD degrees, completed all their hospital rotations, and finally been accepted 
into highly competitive orthopedic residencies.</li> </ul>
<p> <b>One would expect that, during their 5 years of medical training, 
followed by endless hours of hospital rotations and residency programs, that 
all these doctors *might have* picked up a little more musculoskeletal 
knowledge along the way</b>. <b>Evidently this is NOT the case</b>.<br>
<br>
 
These medical authors concluded that residents in orthopedic surgery programs 
are not provided with sufficient training in NMS analysis. The truth is, they 
are incompetent in musculoskeletal assessment or treatment. This situation was 
not corrected during the 4-year interim between the publication of the 1st and 
2nd article, and still has not been corrected 11 years later.<br>
<br>
 Since 
that time there has been a storm brewing at medical schools, but in the 11 
years since Dr. Freedman published his first paper, medical students still 
continue to fail on basic musculoskeletal exams, as documented by the following 
series of peer-reviewed studies.<b>This is a huge problem because 
&#147;conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system are the primary reason 
patients seek medical care from physicians, accounting for nearly 100 million 
office visits per year. [<b>1</b>] &nbsp; Furthermore, musculoskeletal 
conditions are the most common cause of long-term pain and physical disability. 
[<b>2</b>]&#148;</b> [<b>3</b>]<br>
<br>
<b>What's the best solution? If you 
have spinal pain, seek care from someone who is properly trained to assess and 
manage your care. That person is a chiropractor</b>.<br>

articles are listed from the oldest to the newest, so that you can follow the 
lack of progress in correcting this issue at medical schools.<br>

 This is the original article, which found that <b>82 
per cent of medical school graduates failed a valid musculoskeletal competency 
examination.</b> They concluded that &quot;we therefore believe that medical

 Musculoskeletal 
problems are a common reason why patients present for medical treatment. The 
purpose of the present study was to review the curricula of Canadian medical 
schools to determine whether they prepare their students for the demands of 
practice with respect to musculoskeletal problems. The curriculum analysis 
revealed that, on the average, medical schools in Canada devoted 2.26% (range, 
0.61% to 4.81%) of their curriculum time to musculoskeletal education.<b>Our 
literature review and survey of local family physicians revealed that between 
13.7% and 27.8% of North American patients presenting to a primary care 
physician have a chief symptom that is directly related to the musculoskeletal 
system.</b> (So they conclude:) There is a marked discrepancy between the 
musculoskeletal knowledge and skill requirements of a primary care physician 
and the time devoted to musculoskeletal education in Canadian medical schools.

 A previously published knowledge questionnaire 
designed by chief orthopedic residents was given to a Chiropractic student 
group for comparison to the results of the medical resident group. Based on the 
marking scale determined by the chief residents,<b> the Chiropractic group (n = 
51) showed statistically significant higher average grade than the orthopedic 
residents. Expressed in other terms,70% of chiropractic students passed the

 According to the standard suggested by the program 
directors of internal medicine residency departments, a large majority of the 
examinees once again failed to demonstrate basic competency in musculoskeletal 
medicine on the examination. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that 
medical school preparation in musculoskeletal medicine is inadequate. NOTE: 
This is a follow-up article to the study cited below, which<b>demonstrated that 
medical students were inadequately trained to diagnose and treat

It's 8:00 pm on a Monday night. Just as you're getting ready to put your 
5-year-old son to bed, he falls from a chair, landing on his wrist. It quickly 
swells, requiring a visit to a nearby urgent care clinic. At the clinic, a 
pleasant young resident takes a history, performs a physical exam, and orders 
an x-ray to evaluate the injury. You are told that nothing is broken, and a 
wrist splint is placed. The following day, however, you receive a phone call 
from the clinic informing you that upon further review of the radiographs, a 
fracture was detected, and your son will need a cast for definitive treatment. 
This scenario, while fictitious, is not unusual. According to some studies, up 
to 10% of wrist fractures are missed at the initial evaluation.[<b>1</b> ] 
While pediatric fractures are often difficult to detect,<b>this example 
highlights a problem that continues to plague medical education: inadequate 
instruction in musculoskeletal medicine in both medical schooland residency 
training.</b> <br>

 A 
modified version of an exam used to assess the competency of incoming interns 
at the University of Pennsylvania was used to assess the competency of medical 
students during various stages of their training at the University of 
Washington. Despite generally improved levels of competency with each year at 
medical school,<b>less than 50% of fourth-year students showed competency.</b> 
These results suggested that the curricular approach toward teaching 
musculoskeletal medicine at this medical school was insufficient and that 
competency increased when learning was reinforced during the clinical years.<br>

 Sixteen of 17 (94.1%) 
cases demonstrated clinically important improvement. The average time to 
initial clinically important pain relief was 4.5 (range 0-13) days after 
initial presentation, and the average number of visits undergone up to that 
point was 1.8 (range 1-5). No adverse effects were reported in any of the 17 
cases. The results suggest that chiropractic treatment was safe in these cases 
and support the hypothesis that it may be effective for reducing pain intensity.

 For the treatment of low back and neck

 Acute and chronic chiropractic patients experienced better outcomes in pain, 
functional disability, and patient satisfaction. Chiropractic care appeared 
relatively cost-effective for the treatment of chronic LBP. Chiropractic and 
medical care performed comparably for acute patients. Practice-based clinical 
outcomes were consistent with systematic reviews of spinal manipulation 
efficacy: manipulation-based therapy is at least as good as and, in some cases, 
better than other therapeusis. This evidence can guide physicians, payers, and 
policy makers in evaluating chiropractic as a treatment option for low back 
pain.<b>There are more articles like this in the Cost-Effectiveness Page.</b>

 Our data synthesis suggests that 
recommendations can be made with some confidence regarding the use of SMT 
and/or MOB as a viable option for the treatment of both low back pain and neck 
pain. There have been few high-quality trials distinguishing between acute and 
chronic patients, and most are limited to shorter-term follow-up. Future trials 
should examine well-defined subgroups of patients, further address the value of 
SMT and MOB for acute patients, establish optimal number of treatment visits 
and consider the cost-effectiveness of care.<br>

<b>The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) recently made history 
when it concluded that spinal manipulative therapy is the most effective and 
cost-effective treatment for acute low back pain</b> [<b>1</b>]. The 1994 
guidelines for acute low back pain developed by AHCPR concluded that spinal 
manipulation hastens recovery from acute low back pain and recommended that 
this therapy be used in combination with or as an alternative to nonsteroidial 
anti-inflammatory drugs [1]. At the same time, AHCPR concluded that various 
traditional methods, such as bed rest, traction, and other physical and 
pharmaceutical therapies were less effective than spinal manipulation and 
cautioned against lumbar surgery except in the most severe cases. Perhaps most 
significantly, the guidelines state that unlike nonsurgical interventions, 
spinal manipulation offers both pain relief and functional improvement. One 
might conclude that for acute low back pain not caused by fracture, tumor, 
infection, or the cauda equina syndrome, spinal manipulation is the treatment 
of choice.<br>

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This <b>FULL

back pain (LBP) goes away by itself. The discrepancy lies in the method of the 
data collection. Croft et al point out that the original study to publish the 
&quot;90% recovery&quot; results was based on patient consultation records, not 
follow up interviews. By comparison, this study takes into account consultation 
rates as well as follow-up interviews. In fact,<b>Croft's consultation rates 
show a 90% drop-out rate after 3 months, not resolution of the complaint! The 
follow-up interviews, however, showed that most patients simply stopped 
consulting their doctors about low back pain, even though they still suffered 
pain and disability 12 months later! Clearly,the number of visits to general 
practitioners cannot be used as a measure of how quickly the pain and 
disability goes away.</b><br>

scripted to balance for physical contact, attention, and intervention frequency 
and duration. Sessions involved a consistent time commitment and direct 
one-on-one attention from the physician, either in the form of teaching about 
spine anatomy and function, or in assessment and delivery of the sham/HVLA

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specialists in the 
management of spinal disorders have seen tremendous changes in the last decade. 
While the low back pain (LBP) problem has been acknowledged as an epidemic, a 
consensus has gradually emerged as to why this has happened and what can be 
done about it . An overemphasis on the simplistic biomedical approach of 
identifying and treating the structural cause of pain has led to excesses in 
diagnostic testing, bed rest, narcotic analgesics, and surgery (Waddell). 
Meanwhile, an underemphasis on illness behavior has led to an under-utilization 
of functional (re-activation advice, manipulation and exercise) and 
cognitive-behavorial approaches (Feuerstein).<br>

<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b> What is the Natural History for Lower Back Pain?</b><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have all heard 
the statistics that say 83% of patients are better in 6 weeks. Is this 
universally advertised short term outcome true? What do we mean by better? If 
our goal is to improve the quality of care for back pain patients then we first 
need to establish benchmark outcomes of recovery. If improvement is the goal 
then 90% of patients are improving after only 3 weeks. But, if asymptomatic is 
the goal then only 46% reached this goal after 7 weeks. If not having any 
activity limitations due to pain is the goal, as AHCPR suggests, then only 38% 
have achieved this goal by 7 weeks.<br>
