<h1>Premier Health NJ Urges Americans to Seek Physical Therapy for Low Back 
Pain</h1> 
<h2>Despite chronic low back pain, many Americans do not seek the services 
that physical therapists offer. Phillip Kim, D.C., urges his patients to take 
advantage of the pain relief that physical therapy can provide.</h2> 
<ul> 
<li></li> </ul> 
<p>Hackensack, New Jersey (PRWEB) April 17, 2012 </p> 
<p> Low back pain is a common complaint among the American population. In 
fact, a recentarticle released by HealthNewsDigest.com asserts that as much as 
two-thirds of the population suffers from this condition. Surprisingly, 37 
percent of these individuals do not seek the help of professionals in an 
attempt to alleviate this pain. Phillip Kim, D.C., owner of Premier Health NJ, 
finds this number both surprising and disappointing. As a result, he is 
encouraging individuals who experience low back pain to reach out to physical 
therapists.</p> 
<p>According to the aforementioned article, &ldquo;More than one-third of 
adults say low back pain has affected their ability to engage in tasks of daily 
living (39 percent), exercise (38 percent), and sleep (37 percent).&rdquo; 
Minor, sporadic pain may be accepted by people who live busy, stressful lives; 
however, pain intense enough to interfere with daily activities should be 
addressed.</p> 
<p>Turning to physical therapists for pain relief is effective because it gets 
to the root of the problem: &ldquo;By determining the cause of a 
patient&rsquo;s low back pain, physical therapists get to the source of the 
problem and develop a treatment plan, which may include a combination of 
exercises to strengthen the back, manual therapy to improve the mobility of 
joints and soft tissues, and education about how to take better care of the 
back to relieve pain in the long term.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Dr. Kim believes that physical therapy is a wonderful solution because of 
its ability to achieve long-term results. By addressing the cause of the pain, 
and not just the pain itself, physical therapists are able to create treatment 
plans that result in lasting pain relief.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;My goal is to alleviate the pain of each and every patient,&rdquo; 
commented Dr. Kim. &ldquo;I know that physical therapy works for low back pain 
and I wish that every person in America knew that relief was just a 
doctor&rsquo;s appointment away. With physical therapy, people can get rid of 
their back pain and get back to living their lives.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Premier Health NJ, the multi-specialty rehabilitation center that Dr. Kim 
founded, offers the physical therapy treatment that patients with back pain 
need to feel healthy again. Additionally, the office provides chiropractic and 
acupuncture treatment techniques. With this well-rounded list of available 
treatment options, patients at Premier Health NJ can receive an individualized 
care plan that resolves the cause of their pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
