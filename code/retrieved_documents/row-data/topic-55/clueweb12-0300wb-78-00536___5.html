<p>To help relieve your back pain, you may have to go to physical therapy. 
There, a physical therapist will work with you to restore movement and help 
your body heal. The therapist may also teach you about ways to minimize pain in 
the future.</p> 
<p>Physical therapy includes both passive and active treatments. Passive 
treatments help to relax you and your body. They're called passive because you 
don't have to actively participate. Your physical therapy program may start 
with passive treatments as your body heals, but the goal is to get into active 
treatments. These are therapeutic exercises that strengthen your body and help 
prevent a recurrence of your back pain.</p> 
<p><strong>Passive Treatments</strong><br>
 Your physical therapist may give 
you passive treatments such as:</p>  You may be interested in these related

<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong>: This technique targets spasms and 
chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress. You 
could also have spasms or muscle tension because of strains or sprains. The 
therapist uses direct pressure and friction to try to release the tension in 
your soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles).</li> 
<li><strong>Hot and Cold Therapies</strong>: Your physical therapist will 
alternate between hot and cold therapies. By using heat, the physical therapist 
seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood flow 
brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to remove 
waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing.<br>
<br>
 
Cold therapy, also called cryotherapy, slows circulation, helping to reduce 
inflammation, muscle spasms, and pain. You may have a cold pack placed upon the 
target area, or even be given an ice massage. Another cryotherapy option is a 
spray called fluoromethane that cools the tissues. After cold therapy, your 
therapist may work with you to stretch the affected muscles.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)</strong>: A 
TENS machine stimulates your muscles through variable (but safe) intensities of 
electrical current. TENS helps reduce muscle spasms, and it may increase your 
body's production of endorphins, your natural pain killers. The TENS equipment 
your physical therapist uses is relatively large. However, a smaller machine 
for at &quot;at home&quot; use is also available. Whether large or small, a 
TENS unit can be a helpful therapy.</li> 
<li><strong>Ultrasound</strong>: By increasing blood circulation, an 
ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, cramping, swelling, stiffness, and pain. 
It does this by sending sound waves deep into your muscle tissues, creating a 
gentle heat that enhances circulation and healing.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Active Treatments </strong><br>
 In the active part of physical 
therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your 
flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your 
joints move). Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking into 
consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable for 
another person with back pain, especially since your pain might not even be 
caused by the same condition.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>If needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate 
ergonomic principles into your daily activities. This is all part of the 
&quot;self-care&quot; or &quot;self-treatment&quot; aspect of physical therapy: 
through physical therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you 
to take better care of your body.</p> 
<p>Your physical therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program 
for you. This can help reduce the likelihood of your back pain recurring and 
can also improve your overall health.</p>  Updated on: 12/10/09
