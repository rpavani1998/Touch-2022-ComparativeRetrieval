<strong>The History of Chiropractic</strong>
<br> <br>
 Although the chiropractic profession was not founded until 1895, its 
roots can be traced back to the beginning of recorded time.&nbsp; From 2700 to 
1500 B.C., the Chinese and Greeks mention spinal manipulation to ease lower 
back pain in many writings.&nbsp; The Greek physician Hippocrates published 
texts that detail the importance of chiropractic care around 400 B.C.&nbsp; He 
declared, &ldquo;Get knowledge of the spine, for this is the requisite for many 
diseases.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herodotus, a contemporary of Hippocrates, became famous 
curing spinal disease through exercise and spinal manipulation.&nbsp; The 
philosopher Aristotle was critical of his methods because &ldquo;he made old 
men young and thus prolonged their lives too greatly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 It was 
in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer manipulated a deaf man&rsquo;s spine and 
restored his hearing.&nbsp; It was not long before other patients found 
themselves under D.D.&rsquo;s care for just about any condition including flu, 
migraines, epilepsy, sciatica, stomach pain, and heart trouble.&nbsp; Without 
the use of drugs, fevers broke, pain subsided, infections healed, vision 
improved, stomach disorders disappeared, and, of course, hearing returned for 
many of his patients.&nbsp; He realized that spinal adjustments would correct 
for misalignment and motion restrictions, thereby improving upon nerve function 
and strengthening the body.&nbsp; D.D. coined the term 
&ldquo;chiropractic&rdquo; from the Greek words, chiro, meaning 
&ldquo;hand,&rdquo; and practice, meaning &ldquo;practice or 
operation.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the first chiropractic clinic called 
the Palmer School and Infirmary of Chiropractic.<br>
 It has been a long and 
difficult road developing chiropractic into what it is today.&nbsp; Throughout 
the twentieth century, the medical establishment, fearing health care 
competition, conspired to destroy chiropractic care.&nbsp; Finally, in 1983, 
following a decade of litigation with Wilk vs. AMA (American Medical 
Association), the Seventh Circuit Supreme Court upheld a ruling by U.S. 
District Court Judge Susan Getzendanner that the AMA engaged in a 
&quot;lengthy, systematic, successful and unlawful boycott&quot; designed to 
restrict cooperation between MDs and chiropractors in order to eliminate the 
profession of chiropractic care as a competitor in the U.S. health care 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this trial, MDs and DCs are better able to co-manage 
patients, and with better outcomes.<br>

There is growing support and respect for the chiropractic profession around the 
world.&nbsp; Recent studies reflect the cost effectiveness in those who use 
chiropractic treatments as the foundation of their health.&nbsp; In 1993, the 
Manga study published in Canada investigated the cost effectiveness of 
chiropractic care.&nbsp; The results of this study concluded that chiropractic 
care would save hundreds of millions of dollars annually with regard to work 
disability payments and direct health care costs.&nbsp; Numerous studies 
reflect that those who use chiropractic care have less incidence of disease and 
better knowledge of health.<br>
<br>
 Today, doctors of chiropractic are 
licensed and recognized in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto 
Rico.&nbsp; Chiropractic is included in Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal 
Employees Health Care Benefits Programs, Federal Worker&rsquo;s Compensation, 
and all state workers&rsquo; compensation programs.</p> 
<p><em><strong> &ldquo;Chiropractic care is the largest, most regulated, and 
best recognized of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) 
professions.&nbsp; Patient surveys reveal that chiropractors are used more 
often than any other alternative provider group. Patient satisfaction with 
chiropractic treatment is very high.&nbsp; Patient use of chiropractic 
treatment in the United States is steadily increasing, andhas tripled in the 
past two decades.&rdquo;<br>

Medicine 2002.</strong></em></p> 
<p><strong>What Is Chiropractic Care?</strong><br>
<br>
 Chiropractic health 
care focuses musculoskeletal and nervous system disorders, and their effect on 
a patient&rsquo;s general health.&nbsp; Chiropractic care is used most often to 
treat neuromusculoskeletal problems, including but not limited to back pain, 
headaches, pinched nerves, neck pain, joint pain in the arms or legs, and other 
common disorders.<br>
<br>
 Doctors of chiropractic, often referred to as 
chiropractors or chiropractic physicians, practice a drug-free, hands-on 
approach to health care that includes an initial patient examination, 
diagnosis, diagnostic testing, and treatment. Chiropractors have extensive 
diagnostic skills and are trained to recommend appropriate therapeutic and 
rehabilitative care and exercises, as well as to provide nutritional, dietary, 
and lifestyle counseling.<br>
<br>
 The most common therapeutic procedure 
performed by chiropractic doctors is known as &ldquo;spinal 
manipulation,&rdquo; also referred to as &ldquo;chiropractic 
adjustment.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of chiropractic manipulation is to 
restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that 
have become restricted in movement.&nbsp; The manipulation or adjustment of the 
affected joint and tissues restores patient mobility, thereby alleviating pain 
and muscle tightness, and allowing tissues to heal.<br>
<br>
 Chiropractic 
adjustments seldom result in patient discomfort.&nbsp; However, in some cases 
patients do experience mild soreness or aches following treatment (as is 
typical for most forms of exercise) but discomfort usually resolves itself 
within 12 to 48 hours.<br>
<br>
 In many cases, such as with lower back pain, 
chiropractic care may be the primary method of treatment. When other medical 
conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment 
by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition.</p> 
<p><strong>Chiropractic Education</strong></p> 
<p>Educational requirements for doctors of chiropractic are among the most 
stringent of any of the health care professions.&nbsp; Applicant sat a 
chiropractic college have already acquired four years of pre-medical 
undergraduate college education, including courses in biology, inorganic and 
organic chemistry, physics, psychology, and related lab work.&nbsp; Once a 
student is accepted into an accredited chiropractic college, the requirements 
become even more demanding with four to five academic years of professional 
study. Because of the hands-on nature of chiropractic, and the intricate 
adjusting techniques, a significant portion of time is spent in clinical 
training.<br>
<br>
 Like other primary health care doctors, chiropractic 
students spend a significant portion of their curriculum studying clinical 
subjects related to evaluating and caring for patients.&nbsp; Extensive hours 
are spent studying neurology, spine pathology, and spine biomechanics.&nbsp; 
Training in orthopedics and anatomy is combined with training in manipulative 
techniques to develop an understanding of structural and functional 
relationships.&nbsp; In areas such as anatomy, physiology, and rehabilitation, 
chiropractic students receive more intensive education than medical doctors and 
physical therapists.<br>
 Before entering practice, doctors of chiropractic 
must pass national board examinations and become state-licensed.&nbsp; Once in 
practice, chiropractic physicians diagnose health care problems, treat the 
problems when in their scope of practice, and refer to other health care 
practitioners when appropriate.&nbsp; Chiropractors are considered specialty 
physicians in Pennsylvania.</p> <br>

<h2> Chiropractic Pearls </h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&ldquo;In our randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effectiveness 
of manual therapy, physical therapy, and continued care by a general 
practitioner in patients with nonspecific neck pain. The success rate at seven 
weeks was twice as high for the manual therapy group (68.3 percent) as for the 
continued care group (general practitioner). Manual therapy scored better than 
physical therapy on all outcome measures. Patients receiving manual therapy had 
fewer absences from work than patients receiving physical therapy or continued 
care, and manual therapy and physical therapy each resulted in statistically 
significant less analgesic use than continued care.&rdquo;<br>
