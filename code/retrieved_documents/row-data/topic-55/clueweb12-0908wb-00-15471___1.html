<p>It's difficult to live life to the fullest when you have trouble sleeping. 
Most people occasionally experience changes in their normal sleep patterns. 
However, these are usually temporary.&nbsp; But when you are often exhausted, 
have trouble falling asleep, wake up a lot during the night, fall asleep during 
the day, or don't feel refreshed by sleep, you may need to be evaluated.</p>

<p><strong><br>
<em>Frequently Asked Questions <br>
</em><br>
 What happens 
during a sleep study?</strong><br>
 A sleep technician attaches wires to your 
scalp and other areas to monitor your brain wave activity, heart rate, eye 
movement and oxygen level while you sleep. During the test, the technician 
keeps a close watch to make sure you are comfortable.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the treatment options?</strong><br>
 Treatment options 
vary, depending on the type of sleep disorder. They include behavior 
modification, dental devices, and a nasal mask called a C-PAP (for Continuous 
Positive Airway Pressure). The C-PAP keeps your airway open while you sleep. 
Surgery presents another treatment option.</p> 
<p><strong>How do I schedule a sleep study?</strong><br>
 We see patients 
referred by their doctors. For more information, please call Methodist Sleep 
Diagnostic Center, (865) 835-3810.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are conveniently located on
