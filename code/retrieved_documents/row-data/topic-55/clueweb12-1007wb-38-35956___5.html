<li> References </li> </ul>  Low back pain is one of the most common health 
conditions today. According to some estimates, each year nearly 15% to 20% of 
the United States population experiences low back problems, and as many as 80% 
of all adults experience significant low back pain at some point during their 
lives. 1,2  Back pain is the second most common reason adults under age 45 miss 
days from work (after the common cold). The total cost of back pain has been 
estimated to reach $25 billion per year in the US. 3 <br>
 When back pain 
occurs suddenly (after lifting a heavy object, for example), it is called acute 
back pain or sprain. In most cases, acute back pain eventually improves by 
itself, but there may be weeks of discomfort, time lost from work, and impaired 
function at home.  When back pain persists over months or years, it is called 
chronic back pain. In the majority of cases, the cause of chronic back pain is 
unknown. Identifiable causes includeosteoarthritis , fracture, or injury to the 
discs between the vertebrae.<br>
 Conventional treatment of acute back pain 
involves anti-inflammatory drugs  , muscle relaxants, and the passage of time. 
Chronic back pain requires a medical workup to make sure there are no serious 
underlying causes, although evidence suggests that, in most cases, x-rays are 
not necessary. 4  Treatment may also include physical therapy and a graded 
exercise  program. However, there is little reliable evidence that these 
treatments actually provide much benefit. 64,65  Surgery may be recommended in 
certain cases, such as when there are severe disc problems, but most forms of 
back surgery also lack reliable supporting evidence. <br>

<h2>Principal Proposed Natural Treatments</h2>  Extract of the herb white 
willow appears to be helpful for acute and chronic back pain, presumably 
because of its similarity to aspirin. The little-known injection technique 
known as prolotherapy may be effective for back pain as well. Lesser evidence 
supports the use of chiropractic and acupuncture. White Willow <br>
 Willow 
bark has been used as a treatment for pain and fever in China since 500 BC. It 
contains the substance salicin, which is chemically related to aspirin. Another 
ingredient of white willow, tremulacin, may also be important.  In a 4-week, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled  study of 210 individuals with chronic back 
pain, two different doses of willow bark extract were compared against placebo. 
5  The higher-dose group received extract supplying 240 mg of salicin daily; in 
this group, 39% were pain-free for at least the last 5 days of the study. In 
the lower-dose group (120 mg of salicin daily), 21% became pain-free. In 
contrast, only 6% of those given placebo became pain-free. Stomach distress did 
not occur in this study. The only significant side effect seen was an allergic 
reaction in one participant given willow. <br>
Note: White willow should not be 
combined with standard anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen. For more 
information, including dosage and safety issues, see the fullWhite Willow 
article.<br>
Chiropractic <br>
 Chiropractic spinal manipulation is one of the 
most popular treatments for acute and chronic back pain in the US, and it may 
provide at least modest benefit; however, as yet, research evidence has failed 
to find chiropractic manipulation convincingly more effective than standard 
medical care. 49,50,76 <br>
 Chiropractic does seem to be more effective than 
placebo, if not by a great deal. For example, a single-blind, controlled study 
of 84 people suffering from low back pain compared manipulation to treatment 
with a diathermy machine (a physical therapy machine that uses microwaves to 
create heat beneath the skin) that was not actually functioning. 16  The 
researchers asked the participants to assess their own pain levels within 15 
minutes of the first treatment, then 3 and 7 days after treatment. The only 
statistically significant difference between the two groups was within 15 
minutes of the manipulation. (Chiropractic had better results at that point.) 
<br>  In another single-blind, placebo-controlled study, researchers assigned 
209 participants to one of three groups: a high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) 
spinal manipulation; a sham manipulation group; or a back education program. 17 
 Though this has been reported as a positive study, 18  most of the differences 
seen between the groups were too small to be statistically significant. <br>
 
Unimpressive results were also seen in a well-designed study of 321 people with 
back pain, comparing chiropractic manipulation, a special form of physical 
therapy (the Mackenzie method), and the provision of an educational booklet in 
treating low back pain. 25  All groups improved to about the same extent. <br>
 
Several studies evaluated the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation 
combined with a different kind of treatment called mobilization, but they too 
found little to no benefit. 43,45,46 <br>
 On a positive note, one study of 100 
people with back pain and sciatica symptoms (pain down the leg due to disc 
protrusion) found that chiropractic manipulation was significantly more 
effective at relieving symptoms than sham chiropractic manipulation. 57 <br>
 
For low back pain, several studies have found that chiropractic is at least as 
helpful as other commonly used therapies, such as muscle relaxants, soft-tissue 
massage  , and physical therapy. 22-26,51,74  Furthermore, in one well-designed 
study, 2 months of chiropractic spinal manipulation produced somewhat greater 
pain relief than exercise therapy, and this relative superiority endured to the 
1-year follow-up point. 41 <br>
 For more information, see the full Chiropractic
 article.<br>
Acupuncture <br>
 The ancient technique of acupuncture  has 
become increasingly popular as a treatment for pain and other conditions. 
However, thus far, research has not produced clear evidence of 
acupuncture&rsquo;s effectiveness for back pain. 52  In a review of 23 
randomized trials involving over 6,000 patients with chronic low back, 
researchers concluded that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for 
short-term pain relief, but there was no significant difference between the 
effects of true and sham. 79 <br>
 A 6-month, double-blind trial of 1,162 
people with back pain compared real acupuncture, fake acupuncture, and 
conventional therapy. 72  Both real and fake acupuncture were twice as 
effective as conventional therapy according to the measures used. However, 
there was only a minimal difference between real and fake acupuncture. These 
results do not, in fact, indicate that acupuncture is effective per se; rather, 
it shows the significant power of acupuncture as a placebo. <br>
 Similarly, in 
a single-blind, sham-acupuncture, and no-treatment controlled study of 298 
people with chronic back pain, use of real acupuncture failed to prove 
significantly more effective than sham-acupuncture. 58  Also, in a fairly large 
randomized trial involving 638 adults with chronic back pain, there was no 
difference in pain at one year in patients receiving real compared to fake 
acupuncture (with neither group improving significantly over standard care). 
Both real and simulated acupuncture were, however, associated with improved 
function at one year. 80  Other studies have failed to find benefit as well; in 
several controlled studies enrolling a total of over 300 people, real 
acupuncture again failed to prove more effective than sham-acupuncture or other 
placebo treatments. 19,29,32,53 <br>
 One study compared the effects of 
acupuncture, massage  , and education (such as videotapes on back care) for 262 
people with chronic back pain over a 10-week period. 28  The exact type of 
acupuncture and massage was left to practitioners, but only 10 visits were 
permitted. At the 10-week point, evaluations showed benefit with massage but 
not with acupuncture. One year later, massage and education were nearly 
equivalent, and both were superior to acupuncture. <br>
 Low level laser 
therapy (LLLT) is a technique similar to electro-acupuncture that uses 
precision laser energy instead of electricity conducted through a needle. In a 
detailed review of 7 randomized trials, researchers were unable to draw any 
conclusions regarding the effectiveness of LLLT for nonspecific low back pain. 
73 <br>
 Many other studies have compared acupuncture to such treatments as 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, and massage. 14,33-37,59  In many of these trials, 
acupuncture provided benefits comparable to the other options tested. However, 
because TENS, physical therapy, and so forth, have not been proven effective 
for back pain, studies of this type cannot be taken as evidence that 
acupuncture is effective. One study did find acupressure massage more effective 
than standard physical therapy; however, it was performed in a Chinese 
population that may have had more faith in this traditional approach than in 
physical therapy. 60 <br>
 For more information, see the full Acupuncture 
article.<br>

<h2>Other Proposed Natural Treatments</h2> Herbal Treatments <br>
 In a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 215 people with back pain, use 
of a topical cream made from the herb comfrey  produced statistically 
significant benefits as compared to placebo. 61 <br>
 The herb devil's claw  is 
used for the treatment of osteoarthritis  , and has been tried for back pain as 
well. However, the results have been less than impressive. A double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 197 individuals with chronic back pain found 
devil's claw only marginally effective at best. 38  Similarly poor results were 
seen in an earlier 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 118 
individuals with acute back pain. 39  However, a 4-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 63 people with mild to moderate chronic muscular 
tension in the neck, back, and shoulders did find some benefit. 27 <br>
 The 
herb cayenne  contains capsaicin, a substance that produces an immediate 
burning sensation but later reduces pain. One double-blind study found a 
topical cayenne treatment more effective than placebo in 320 people with low 
back pain. 54  However, on the face of it, one finds it difficult to believe 
that this study was truly double-blind. When cayenne is applied to the skin, it 
causes such an intense sensation that participants could hardly fail to notice 
it. When people in a study know whether they are getting real treatment or 
placebo treatment, the validity of the study's results is greatly decreased. 
<br>  Other herbs and supplements sometimes recommended for back pain, but with 
no real supporting evidence, include:boswellia , butterbur , chondroitin , 
ginger , glucosamine , and turmeric . <br>
Manual Therapies <br>
Osteopathic 
manipulation  (OM) is a form of treatment related to chiropractic manipulation, 
but it tends to use gentle, extended movements (low velocity, high amplitude) 
rather than the quick, short, cracking movements of chiropractic. Although OM 
has shown some promise for the treatment of back pain, 15,20,40  one of the 
best-designed trials failed to find it a superior alternative to conventional 
medical care. In this 12-week study of 178 individuals, osteopathic 
manipulation proved no more effective than standard treatment for back pain. 40 
 Another study failed to find OM more effective than sham manipulation. 55 <br>

 In a review of 13 randomized trials, researchers concluded that massage may be 
effective for nonspecific low back pain, and the beneficial effects can last 
for up to 1 year in patients suffering from chronic pain. 77  They also noted 
that exercise and education appear to enhance the effectiveness of massage. A 
subsequent large study involving 401 adults (aged 20-65 years old) with 
nonspecific back pain also supports the use of massage. 84  The patients were 
randomized to one of three groups: structural massage, relaxation massage, or 
usual care. At 10 weeks, those in the massage groups had improved function and 
fewer symptoms compared to the usual care group. But unlike the previous 
review, there were no differences, though, at weeks 26 and 52. See the article 
on Massage  for more details. <br>
 The Alexander Technique is a special method 
of postural training popular among dancers and other performers. A review of 
the literature found no more than weak preliminary evidence that Alexander may 
help with back pain, but concluded that further research is warranted. 56  A 
subsequent controlled trial involving 579 patients with chronic or recurrent 
low back pain found that Alexander technique lessons, particularly when 
combined with exercise, was more effective than normal care or massage after 
one year. 78 <br>
Prolotherapy <br>
 The use of prolotherapy to treat back pain 
has had mixed results in clinical studies.  Invented in the 1950s by George 
Hackett, prolotherapy is based on the theory that chronic pain is often caused 
by laxness of the ligaments that are responsible for keeping a joint stable. 
When ligaments and associated tendons are loose, the body is said to compensate 
by using muscles to hold the joint stable. The net result, according to 
prolotherapy theory, is muscle spasms and pain.  Prolotherapy treatment 
involves injections of chemical irritant solutions into the area around such 
ligaments. These solutions are believed to cause tissue to proliferate (grow), 
increasing the strength and thickness of ligaments. 9,10,11  This presumably 
serves to tighten up the joint and allow the associated muscles to stop having 
spasms. In the case of arthritic joints, increased ligament strength would 
allow the joint to function more efficiently, reducing pain. <br>
 Although two 
studies have suggested prolotherapy may be effective, 12,13  two more recent 
studies found prolotherapy to be ineffective. 47,48 <br>
 In a review of five 
studies, three found prolotherapy to be no more effective than control 
treatments for treating low back pain. The other two studies suggested that 
prolotherapy was more effective than control treatments when used with 
therapies such as spinal manipulation and exercise. 81  Another review 
suggested prolotherapy may be effective when used with other therapies, but not 
when used alone. 82 <br>
 What can one make of this contradictory evidence? 
When used alone prolotherapy is probably no more effective than a placebo 
injection for the treatment of chronic low back pain. However, there is some 
evidence that the technique may be beneficial when combined with other 
therapies.  For more information, see the full Prolotherapy article. <br>
Other 
Therapies <br>
Biofeedback  , 21 balneotherapy  , 66-67 hatha yoga  , 62, 63,75 
magnet therapy  , 70,71  and relaxation therapies 69,83  have also shown at 
least a hint of promise for treating back pain. Though for some of these, there 
have been as many negative as positive studies, and for many of them only 
short-term benefits were shown. <br>
 In one interesting study, 444 people with 
acute low back pain were randomly assigned to receive either usual care or 
usual care plus a choice of alternative therapies (chiropractic, acupuncture, 
or massage). 68  The results showed that while the use of alternative therapies 
improved patient satisfaction, it did not significantly improve symptoms. <br>
 
Preliminary evidence suggests that proteolytic enzymes  might be helpful for 
back pain. 44 <br>

<h2>Herbs and Supplements to Use Only With Caution</h2>  Various herbs and 
supplements may interact adversely with drugs used to treat back pain. For more
