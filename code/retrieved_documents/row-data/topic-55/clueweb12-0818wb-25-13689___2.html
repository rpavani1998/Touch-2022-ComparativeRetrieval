<b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p> 
<p>The resources contained in this information pack -books, journals, 
professional organizations, treatment centers, search services and Web 
resources - relate to alternative and complementary therapy options available 
for manipulative therapies.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>They are not meant to be 
endorsements for any individual, group, or type of therapy over others.</p> 
<p>Conventional medicine does not have many effective treatments for chronic 
illnesses and pain, spinal and joint difficulties, digestive disorders, and 
many other non-acute health problems are generally less effectively treated by 
conventional medicine. The main approach is to use drug therapy to dampen 
symptoms while the causal factor is usually ignored, and therefore left 
untreated. The manipulative therapies covered in this resource guide have been 
shown - both clinically and through research - to be beneficial for a wide 
range of problems that have previously failed to respond to conventional 
medicine.</p>

GENERAL AND ORTHOPEDIC MANUAL THERAPY</strong><b><br>
</b><br>

 Manual therapy is a general term for modalities that use the hands to diagnose 
and treat illness and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as to maintain health.
&nbsp;Orthopedic manual therapy is a specialty of physiotherapy that is based 
upon three principles:</p> 
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orthopedic: relating to disorders of 
structures forming joints, together with associated muscles, connective 
tissues, nerve roots and peripheral nerves (neuro-muscular-articular system)</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manipulative: the skilled and specialized 
use of manual and/or mechanically applied movement techniques, as a part of 
comprehensive orthopedic physical therapy for disorders of the moving parts of 
body</p> 
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therapy: relating to therapy by a 
physiotherapist, physical therapist</p> 
<p>Manual therapy also includes modalities such as chiropractic therapy, 
craniosacral therapy, massage therapy, and osteopathic manipulative 
techniques/medicine (OMT/OMM).&nbsp; Each of these modalities is addressed in 
deeper detail in later sections of this resource guide (click on<em>Back to 
Contents</em> to access these modalities).</p>

<b>MASSAGE THERAPY</b></p> 
<p>The medicinal benefits of the various types of massage techniques are 
increasingly becoming recognized and accepted. According to the<i>Journal of 
the American Medical Association,<em> </em></i>the number of adults seeking 
massages nearly doubled between 1990 and 1997, with nearly 114 million visits 
in 1997 alone. Research has shown that massage can alleviate pain, increase 
alertness and reduce levels of circulating stress hormones. Massage&#146;s 
effect on lower back pain is also promising, at least as effective as 
acupuncture or self-education approaches in reducing pain and increasing the 
ability to accomplish basic physical activities.</p> 
<p>In finding a qualified and licensed massage therapist, there are some facts 
to be aware of. Currently there are approximately 120,000 therapists in the 
U.S., yet only 29 states and the District of Columbia require practitioners to 
be licensed. Although rules vary from state to state, applicants must usually 
complete 500 or more hours of education and pass a certification exam. Call 
your state health department to learn how to verify a state license. 
Additionally, you may want to determine if your therapist is certified by the 
National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork.</p>

ROLFING</b></p> 
<p>More than 50 years ago, Dr. Ida Rolf began her inquiry into creating a 
holistic system of soft tissue manipulation and movement education that would 
organize the whole body with respect to gravity. She discovered that she could 
achieve remarkable changes in posture and structure by manipulating the body's 
myofascial system. She eventually named this system &quot;structural 
integration,&quot; although some still refer to it as &quot;Rolfing,&quot; 
after its founder.</p> 
<p>Rolfing&reg;, or structural integration, balances and aligns the body along 
a natural vertical axis by gradually stretching, lengthening and repositioning 
the fascia, restoring its normal length and flexibility. The practitioner 
combines deep, gentle pressure with the client&#146;s breathing and movement to 
free fascial restrictions. Rolfing&reg; is said to improve alignment at any 
stage in life.</p> 
<p>Although there are several organizations that offer courses in variations 
of Rolfing (see &quot;Professional Organization&quot; section), certification 
is earned through the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration. This 
certification enables graduates of the training program to become members of 
the Rolf Institute, and offer this work to the public, referring to themselves 
as &quot;Certified Rolfers&quot; and Rolf Movement Practitioners.</p>

<b>CHIROPRACTIC THERAPY</b></p> 
<p>Chiropractors influence the body's nervous and immune systems by adjusting 
the spine and joints, thereby alleviating pain and bettering general health. 
This field takes a holistic approach to health and illness, and encourages the 
body's innate tendency towards health. Its effectiveness in administering to 
back pain, headaches, and other injuries and traumas has contributed to 
chiropractic&#146;s place as the second largest primary health care field in 
the world.</p> 
<p>The National Center for Quality Assurance (NCQA) defines specific standards 
about how credentials are to be determined in the chiropractic profession. 
Chiropractic practitioners earn a doctor of chiropractic (D.C.) degree from 
programs and solitary purpose institutions holding accredited status with the 
Council on Chiropractic Education in the United States. D.C.&#146;s also are 
required to pass a state licensing board exam. While most chiropractors do not 
have hospital clinical privileges, this should not hinder practice or 
credentialing. These credential guidelines for chiropractors are provided by 
the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards at<b>

CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY</b></p> 
<p>In this type of therapy, the bones of the skull are gently manipulated to 
alleviate a wide range of conditions, including headaches, ear infections, 
strokes, spinal cord injuries, and cerebral palsy. The craniosacral movement 
created by the rhythmical increase and decrease in cerebrospinal fluid causes a 
predictable movement of the cranial bones. A cranial therapist is trained to 
palpate this motion and diagnose the movement of the system as a whole by 
locating critical points of restriction in the cranium.</p> 
<p>Official certification can be obtained from the Upledger Institute (UI), 
through a rigorous two-level program. Therapists certified at UI must maintain 
their certification through continuing education credits.</p>

OSTEOPATHY</b></b></p> 
<p><b>Osteopathy is a holistic and more preventive approach to medicine as 
compared to conventional medicine. The focus is to help restore balance between 
the structure and functionING of the musculoskeletal system, which is the 
largest and most energy-consuming system in the body. Tension or mechanical 
restriction anywhere in this system can adversely Affect other physiological 
systems and organs within the body. Research supports the fact that osteopathy 
can help or resolve many health problems that fail to respond to conventional 
medicine. A few of the illnesses helped by osteopathic manipulation are spinal 
and joint conditions, arthritis, allergies, cardiac diseases, breathing 
dysfunctions, chronic fatigue syndrome, hiatal hernias, high blood pressure, 
headaches, digestive disorders, bladder and menstrual problems, prostate 
congestion, and numerous neuritis disorders.</b></p> 
<p><b>Practitioners earn a doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) degree from one of the 
19 accredited osteopathic medical schools in the United States. D.O.'s have the 
same scope of practice as allopathic doctors (M.D.'s), including the ability to 
prescribe drugs and perform surgery. D.O.'s and M.D.'s complete four years of 
basic medical education, complete an internship and a residency program, must 
pass the same or equivalent state licensing examinations, and practice side by 
side in fully accredited and licensed hospitals and medical centers.</b></p>
