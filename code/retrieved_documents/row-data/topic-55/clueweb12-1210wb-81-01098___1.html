<h2>Using Physical Therapy To Treat Neck Pain</h2> 21 January 2010 0 <br>

<p> Sooner or later just about everyone experiences some type of neck pain. 
One of the most common complaints comes from something simple like sleeping in 
an odd position or straining at the gym. Typically in a day or two the pain 
subsides with basic home care; icing, over the counter medications and a better 
pillow. For some instances, physical therapy can be a major help.</p> 
<p>Proper Assessment -</p> 
<p>If you choose to see a physical therapist for your neck pain your 
experience should begin with a comprehensive physical exam. The therapist 
should assess your movement patterns, your flexibility and evaluate if the pain 
is localized or if you have numbness or tingling in your arms and hands. Your 
reflexes should also be evaluated through a number of non-invasive tests.</p> 
<p>The Treatment Experience -</p> 
<p>Once a thorough assessment has been completed, a treatment plan will be 
devised. These plans usually include stretching, strengthening and pain relief. 
The therapist may opt to use heat, cold or a combination of both. Electrical 
stimulation and ultrasound may be incorporated as well. The goal is to not only 
reduce your pain but also to prevent recurrences.</p> 
<p>A number of appropriate exercises and stretches will be taught to you by 
your therapist. These are to be performed daily, even when you don&rsquo;t 
attend a therapy session during the day. Each week or two new exercises will be 
added as appropriate to continue your progress. Periodically your progress will 
be assessed and the treatment plan adjusted as needed. Expect to spend a number 
of weeks in therapy.</p> 
<p>Traction -</p> 
<p>Both physical therapists and chiropractors treat some sources of neck pain 
with traction. For bulging cervical disks traction can be an effective way to 
reduce pressure upon the disk. The intention is to increase the space between 
the vertebrae and reduce the pressure that injured disks may place upon nerves. 
Traction can be done continuously, where the pull remains constant over a 
period of time, or intermittently, where the pull occurs in cycles.</p> 
<p>Cervical traction can be performed at home with the proper equipment but it 
is best to see a practitioner initially and learn how to perform the procedure 
properly. Once you have learned the process you can add it to your daily 
routine between sessions.</p> 
<p>Cervical Collars; Questionable results -</p> 
<p>In days gone by you could expect to see people walking around wearing 
cervical collars on a regular basis. Today, very few people use them. It was 
discovered that the wholesale use of the collars didn&rsquo;t do much to help 
heal injured necks, but defiantly cause neck muscles to weaken over time.</p> 
<p>Cervical collars are still used periodically, but more to remind 
individuals to maintain proper posture while healing an injury than as a 
routine part of neck care. Rigid collars, occasionally used for whiplash or 
skeletal neck injuries are uncomfortable and must be used with care.</p> 
<p>Neck pain, whether acute or chronic, can have a profound effect upon day to 
day life. Fortunately, between the sporadic nature of the complaint, in 
general, and the many treatment options, most people find acceptable solutions 
to their neck pain issues.</p>
