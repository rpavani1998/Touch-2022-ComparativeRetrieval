<p>Low back pain is one of the most common health conditions today. According 
to some estimates, each year nearly 15% to 20% of the United States population 
experiences low back problems, and as many as 80% of all adults experience 
significant low back pain at some point during their lives.1,2Back pain is the 
second most common reason adults under age 45 miss days from work (after the 
common cold). The total cost of back pain has been estimated to reach $25 
billion per year in the US.3</p> 
<p>When back pain occurs suddenly (after lifting a heavy object, for example), 
it is called acute back pain or sprain. In most cases, acute back pain 
eventually improves by itself, but there may be weeks of discomfort, time lost 
from work, and impaired function at home.</p> 
<p> When back pain persists over months or years, it is called chronic back 
pain. In the majority of cases, the cause of chronic back pain is unknown. 
Identifiable causes includeosteoarthritis, fracture, or injury to the discs 
between the vertebrae.</p> 
<p> Conventional treatment of acute back pain involves anti-inflammatory drugs
, muscle relaxants, and the passage of time. Chronic back pain requires a 
medical workup to make sure there are no serious underlying causes, although 
evidence suggests that, in most cases, x-rays are not necessary.4 Treatment may 
also include physical therapy and a gradedexerciseprogram. However, there is 
little reliable evidence that these treatments actually provide much benefit.
64,65 Surgery may be recommended in certain cases, such as when there are 
severe disc problems, but most forms of back surgery also lack reliable 
supporting evidence.</p> 
<p>Extract of the herb white willow appears to be helpful for acute and 
chronic back pain, presumably because of its similarity to aspirin. The 
little-known injection technique known as prolotherapy may be effective for 
back pain as well. Lesser evidence supports the use of chiropractic and 
acupuncture.</p> 
<p> <strong>White Willow</strong> </p> 
<p>Willow bark has been used as a treatment for pain and fever in China since 
500 BC. It contains the substance salicin, which is chemically related to 
aspirin. Another ingredient of white willow, tremulacin, may also be important.
</p> 
<p> In a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy of 210 individuals with 
chronic back pain, two different doses of willow bark extract were compared 
against placebo.5 The higher-dose group received extract supplying 240 mg of 
salicin daily; in this group, 39% were pain-free for at least the last 5 days 
of the study. In the lower-dose group (120 mg of salicin daily), 21% became 
pain-free. In contrast, only 6% of those given placebo became pain-free. 
Stomach distress did not occur in this study. The only significant side effect 
seen was an allergic reaction in one participant given willow.</p> 
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> White willow should not be combined with standard 
anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen. For more information, including 
dosage and safety issues, see the fullWhite Willow article. </p> 
<p> <strong>Chiropractic</strong> </p> 
<p>Chiropractic spinal manipulation is one of the most popular treatments for 
acute and chronic back pain in the US, and it may provide at least modest 
benefit; however, as yet, research evidence has failed to find chiropractic 
manipulation convincingly more effective than standard medical care.49,50,76</p>
<p>Chiropractic does seem to be more effective than placebo, if not by a great 
deal. For example, a single-blind, controlled study of 84 people suffering from 
low back pain compared manipulation to treatment with a diathermy machine (a 
physical therapy machine that uses microwaves to create heat beneath the skin) 
that was not actually functioning.16 The researchers asked the participants to 
assess their own pain levels within 15 minutes of the first treatment, then 3 
and 7 days after treatment. The only statistically significant difference 
between the two groups was within 15 minutes of the manipulation. (Chiropractic 
had better results at that point.)</p> 
<p>In another single-blind, placebo-controlled study, researchers assigned 209 
participants to one of three groups: a high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) 
spinal manipulation; a sham manipulation group; or a back education program.17
Though this has been reported as a positive study,18 most of the differences 
seen between the groups were too small to be statistically significant.</p> 
<p>Unimpressive results were also seen in a well-designed study of 321 people 
with back pain, comparing chiropractic manipulation, a special form of physical 
therapy (the Mackenzie method), and the provision of an educational booklet in 
treating low back pain.25 All groups improved to about the same extent. </p> 
<p>Several studies evaluated the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation 
combined with a different kind of treatment called mobilization, but they too 
found little to no benefit.43,45,46</p> 
<p>On a positive note, one study of 100 people with back pain and sciatica 
symptoms (pain down the leg due to disc protrusion) found that chiropractic 
manipulation was significantly more effective at relieving symptoms than sham 
chiropractic manipulation.57</p> 
<p> For low back pain, several studies have found that chiropractic is at 
least as helpful as other commonly used therapies, such as muscle relaxants, 
soft-tissuemassage, and physical therapy.22-26,51,74Furthermore, in one 
well-designed study, 2 months of chiropractic spinal manipulation produced 
somewhat greater pain relief than exercise therapy, and this relative 
superiority endured to the 1-year follow-up point.41</p> 
<p> For more information, see the full Chiropractic article. </p> 
<p> <strong>Acupuncture</strong> </p> 
<p> The ancient technique of acupuncturehas become increasingly popular as a 
treatment for pain and other conditions. However, thus far, research has not 
produced clear evidence of acupuncture&rsquo;s effectiveness for back pain.52In 
a review of 23 randomized trials involving over 6,000 patients with chronic low 
back, researchers concluded that acupuncture is more effective than no 
treatment for short-term pain relief, but there was no significant difference 
between the effects of true and sham.79</p> 
<p>A 6-month, double-blind trial of 1,162 people with back pain compared real 
acupuncture, fake acupuncture, and conventional therapy.72 Both real and fake 
acupuncture were twice as effective as conventional therapy according to the 
measures used. However, there was only a minimal difference between real and 
fake acupuncture. These results do not, in fact, indicate that acupuncture is 
effective per se; rather, it shows the significant power of acupuncture as a 
placebo.</p> 
<p>Similarly, in a single-blind, sham-acupuncture, and no-treatment controlled 
study of 298 people with chronic back pain, use of real acupuncture failed to 
prove significantly more effective than sham-acupuncture.58Also, in a fairly 
large randomized trial involving 638 adults with chronic back pain, there was 
no difference in pain at one year in patients receiving real compared to fake 
acupuncture (with neither group improving significantly over standard care). 
Both real and simulated acupuncture were, however, associated with improved 
function at one year.80Other studies have failed to find benefit as well; in 
several controlled studies enrolling a total of over 300 people, real 
acupuncture again failed to prove more effective than sham-acupuncture or other 
placebo treatments.19,29,32,53</p> 
<p> One study compared the effects of acupuncture, massage, and education 
(such as videotapes on back care) for 262 people with chronic back pain over a 
10-week period.28 The exact type of acupuncture and massage was left to 
practitioners, but only 10 visits were permitted. At the 10-week point, 
evaluations showed benefit with massage but not with acupuncture. One year 
later, massage and education were nearly equivalent, and both were superior to 
acupuncture.</p> 
<p>Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a technique similar to 
electro-acupuncture that uses precision laser energy instead of electricity 
conducted through a needle. In a detailed review of 7 randomized trials, 
researchers were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of 
LLLT for nonspecific low back pain.73</p> 
<p>Many other studies have compared acupuncture to such treatments as 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, and massage.14,33-37,59In many of these trials, acupuncture 
provided benefits comparable to the other options tested. However, because 
TENS, physical therapy, and so forth, have not been proven effective for back 
pain, studies of this type cannot be taken as evidence that acupuncture is 
effective. One study did find acupressure massage more effective than standard 
physical therapy; however, it was performed in a Chinese population that may 
have had more faith in this traditional approach than in physical therapy.60</p>
<p> For more information, see the full Acupuncture article. </p> 
<h5>Other Proposed Natural Treatments</h5> 
<p> <strong>Herbal Treatments</strong> </p> 
<p> In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 215 people with back 
pain, use of a topical cream made from the herbcomfreyproduced statistically 
significant benefits as compared to placebo.61</p> 
<p> The herb devil's claw is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, and has 
been tried for back pain as well. However, the results have been less than 
impressive. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 197 individuals with 
chronic back pain found devil's claw only marginally effective at best.38
Similarly poor results were seen in an earlier 4-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 118 individuals with acute back pain.39However, a 
4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 63 people with mild to 
moderate chronic muscular tension in the neck, back, and shoulders did find 
some benefit.27</p> 
<p> The herb cayennecontains capsaicin, a substance that produces an immediate 
burning sensation but later reduces pain. One double-blind study found a 
topical cayenne treatment more effective than placebo in 320 people with low 
back pain.54 However, on the face of it, one finds it difficult to believe that 
this study was truly double-blind. When cayenne is applied to the skin, it 
causes such an intense sensation that participants could hardly fail to notice 
it. When people in a study know whether they are getting real treatment or 
placebo treatment, the validity of the study's results is greatly decreased.</p>
<p> Other herbs and supplements sometimes recommended for back pain, but with 
no real supporting evidence, include:boswellia, butterbur, chondroitin, ginger, 
glucosamine, and turmeric. </p> 
<p> <strong>Manual Therapies</strong> </p> 
<p> Osteopathic manipulation(OM) is a form of treatment related to 
chiropractic manipulation, but it tends to use gentle, extended movements (low 
velocity, high amplitude) rather than the quick, short, cracking movements of 
chiropractic. Although OM has shown some promise for the treatment of back pain,
15,20,40one of the best-designed trials failed to find it a superior 
alternative to conventional medical care. In this 12-week study of 178 
individuals, osteopathic manipulation proved no more effective than standard 
treatment for back pain.40Another study failed to find OM more effective than 
sham manipulation.55</p> 
<p>In a review of 13 randomized trials, researchers concluded that massage may 
be effective for nonspecific low back pain, and the beneficial effects can last 
for up to 1 year in patients suffering from chronic pain.77They also noted that 
exercise and education appear to enhance the effectiveness of massage. A 
subsequent large study involving 401 adults (aged 20-65 years old) with 
nonspecific back pain also supports the use of massage.84 The patients were 
randomized to one of three groups: structural massage, relaxation massage, or 
usual care. At 10 weeks, those in the massage groups had improved function and 
fewer symptoms compared to the usual care group. But unlike the previous 
review, there were no differences, though, at weeks 26 and 52. See the article 
onMassage for more details.</p> 
<p>The Alexander Technique is a special method of postural training popular 
among dancers and other performers. A review of the literature found no more 
than weak preliminary evidence that Alexander may help with back pain, but 
concluded that further research is warranted.56A subsequent controlled trial 
involving 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain found that 
Alexander technique lessons, particularly when combined with exercise, was more 
effective than normal care or massage after one year.78</p> 
<p> <strong>Prolotherapy</strong> </p> 
<p>The use of prolotherapy to treat back pain has had mixed results in 
clinical studies.</p> 
<p>Invented in the 1950s by George Hackett, prolotherapy is based on the 
theory that chronic pain is often caused by laxness of the ligaments that are 
responsible for keeping a joint stable. When ligaments and associated tendons 
are loose, the body is said to compensate by using muscles to hold the joint 
stable. The net result, according to prolotherapy theory, is muscle spasms and 
pain.</p> 
<p>Prolotherapy treatment involves injections of chemical irritant solutions 
into the area around such ligaments. These solutions are believed to cause 
tissue to proliferate (grow), increasing the strength and thickness of 
ligaments.9,10,11 This presumably serves to tighten up the joint and allow the 
associated muscles to stop having spasms. In the case of arthritic joints, 
increased ligament strength would allow the joint to function more efficiently, 
reducing pain.</p> 
<p>Although two studies have suggested prolotherapy may be effective,12,13two 
more recent studies found prolotherapy to be ineffective.47,48</p> 
<p>In a review of five studies, three found prolotherapy to be no more 
effective than control treatments for treating low back pain. The other two 
studies suggested that prolotherapy was more effective than control treatments 
when used with therapies such as spinal manipulation and exercise.81Another 
review suggested prolotherapy may be effective when used with other therapies, 
but not when used alone.82</p> 
<p>What can one make of this contradictory evidence? When used alone 
prolotherapy is probably no more effective than a placebo injection for the 
treatment of chronic low back pain. However, there is some evidence that the 
technique may be beneficial when combined with other therapies.</p> 
<p> For more information, see the full Prolotherapy article. </p> 
<p> <strong>Other Therapies</strong> </p> 
<p> Biofeedback,21balneotherapy,66-67hatha yoga,62, 63,75magnet therapy,70,71 
andrelaxation therapies69,83 have also shown at least a hint of promise for 
treating back pain. Though for some of these, there have been as many negative 
as positive studies, and for many of them only short-term benefits were shown.
</p> 
<p>In one interesting study, 444 people with acute low back pain were randomly 
assigned to receive either usual care or usual care plus a choice of 
alternative therapies (chiropractic, acupuncture, or massage).68 The results 
showed that while the use of alternative therapies improved patient 
satisfaction, it did not significantly improve symptoms.</p> 
<p> Preliminary evidence suggests that proteolytic enzymesmight be helpful for 
back pain.44</p> 
<h5>Herbs and Supplements to Use Only With Caution</h5> 
<p> Various herbs and supplements may interact adversely with drugs used to 
treat back pain. For more information on this potential risk, see the 
individual drug article in theDrug Interactions section of this database. </p>
