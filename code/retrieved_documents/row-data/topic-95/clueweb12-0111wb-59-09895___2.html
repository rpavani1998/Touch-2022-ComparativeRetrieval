<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p> 
<h2>Edmunds Women's Car Guide Finds Women Eagerly Adopting New Environmentally 
Friendly Car Technologies</h2> 
<p><strong>SANTA MONICA, Calif. &mdash; September 29, 2005 &mdash;</strong> 
Natural gas. Hybrid electric. Diesel. Women are at the vanguard of putting 
these new technologies through their everyday paces. For its newWomen's Car 
Guide (www.edmunds.com/women) section, Edmunds.com, the premier online 
automotive resource, spoke to women across the U.S. to learn the benefits and 
drawbacks of owning these eco-friendly cars, presented in a three-part series 
entitled &quot;How Far Would You Go For the Planet?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Women are very sensitive to their impact on the environment,&quot; 
said Joanne Helperin, senior features editor for Edmunds.com. &quot;And an 
increasing number of women are interested in purchasing 'green' vehicles for 
other, more practical reasons, including significantly better mileage, access 
to free parking or express driving lanes and significant tax incentives.&quot;
</p> 
<p>In &quot;How Far Would You Go For the Planet?,&quot; site visitors can tap 
into the experiences of women who are driving the natural gas-powered Honda 
Civic GX; the most popular hybrid electric, the Toyota Prius; and the new 
generation of clean burning diesels, the Volkswagen Golf and Jeep Liberty CDI. 
Readers can hear from women who are committed to using biodiesel &mdash; made 
from vegetable products &mdash; to fuel their cars, as well as women who own 
and operate the &quot;BioFuel Oasis,&quot; which sells only biodiesel. To read 
the full article, visitwww.edmunds.com/women. </p> 
<p><strong>About the Women's Car Guide (www.edmunds.com/women)</strong><br>
 
The Edmunds.comWomen's Car Guide empowers women in all areas of the vehicle 
purchase and ownership experience. Written primarily by Edmunds.com's female 
editors, it offers comprehensive buying advice as well as articles specifically 
focused on primary areas of concern and interest, including vehicle safety and 
alternative fuel vehicles. The Guide asks, &quot;Who Do You Want to be?&quot;, 
and creatively arranges answers in content categories: &quot;A Smart 
Shopper,&quot; &quot;A Bargain Hunter,&quot; &quot;A Strong Negotiator,&quot; 
&quot;A Family Manager,&quot; &quot;A Safety Expert,&quot; and &quot;A Green 
Consumer.&quot; Included in the Women's Car Guide is feedback from female 
Edmunds.com users about their own cars (Consumer Reviews and Ratings) and 
headlines relevant to women. Additionally, there are links to discussion forums 
where women can exchange advice and stories.</p>
