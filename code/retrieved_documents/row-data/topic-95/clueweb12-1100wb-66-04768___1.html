<p> Bombardier Transportation (BBD.TO)announced today it has signed two 
contracts to supply the first North American hybrid, or dual-powered, passenger 
locomotives to the New Jersey Transit Corporation and the Agence Metropolitaine 
de Transport (AMT) in Montreal.<br>
<br>
 The new dual-powered locomotives are 
capable of operating under both diesel power and alternating current electric 
power from overhead sources. The flexible power system will enable the 
locomotives to operate across the entire NJ TRANSIT and AMT rail systems, which 
include both electrified and non-electrified lines.<br>
<br>
 The order from NJ 
Transit, valued at approximately 178 million euros ($262 million US), is for 26 
dual-powered locomotives, capable of running on both diesel power and 
alternating current electric power from overhead sources. The contract includes 
options for an additional 63 locomotives.<br>
<br>
 The order from AMT, valued 
at approximately 152 million euros ($223 million US), is for 20 dual-powered 
locomotives.<br>
<br>
 Locomotives for both contracts will be built at 
Bombardier manufacturing facilities in Germany and Poland. Delivery to clients 
is scheduled to begin in 2011.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We are proud to support NJ 
TRANSIT and AMT in their continuing commitment to provide modern, efficient, 
environmentally-friendly passenger rail service.&quot; said Ake Wennberg, 
President, Locomotives and Equipment Division, Bombardier Transportation.<br>

<br> NJ TRANSIT is the third largest provider of public transit in the United 
States. AMT is the second largest commuter rail service in Canada and the sixth 
in terms of ridership in North America. AMT is the umbrella organization that 
plans, integrates and coordinates public transportation services across the 
greater Montreal region.</p> <br>
