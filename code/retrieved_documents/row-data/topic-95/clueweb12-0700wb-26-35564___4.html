<h1><strong> Inaugural EARTH ANGEL Award<br>
 Celebrates Environmentally 
Friendly Automakers<br>
</strong></h1> 
<p> In response to the&nbsp;rising gas prices&nbsp;and growing concern for 
global warming, the International Car of the Year Awards (ICOTY) recently 
polled automakers worldwide about the significant strides they were 
making&nbsp;on environmental issues and green initiatives.</p> 
<p>To celebrate this work,&nbsp;the ICOTY Awards&nbsp;launched its 
inaugural&nbsp;EARTH ANGEL Award, which honored General Motors Corporation 
as&nbsp;the automaker who contributed the most to aiding environmental 
improvements and initiatives on a world wide level.</p> <br>
<br>
<strong>
Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) and ICOTY producer, Courtney Caldwell (r) present the 
inaugural EARTH ANGEL Award to Beth Lowery, VP Environment, Energy &amp; Safety 
Policy, General Motors Corporation.</strong> <br>
<br>

<p>&ldquo;Automakers are too often criticized for environmental insensitivity 
when the reality is that they&rsquo;re making enormous strides on a global 
level to improve the earth&rsquo;s environment,&rdquo; said Courtney Caldwell, 
ICOTY&nbsp;creator and producer. &ldquo;Our goal is to shed light on these many 
positive accomplishments, especially those not known to the general public or 
media.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 All automakers were invited to participate in the 
inaugural award by answering a series of six questions related to their 
environmental initiatives. Of those contacted BMW, Daimler, Ford Motor Company, 
General Motors, American Honda, Hyundai, Subaru and Toyota responded.</p> 
<p>Though the responses from individual automakers varied, the EARTH ANGEL 
Award submissions show each company is making significant strides in the fight 
against global warming.</p> <br>

<p>A number of automakers are creating more fuel efficient vehicles, including 
hybrids and ethanol (E85) versions. Additionally, automotive companies are 
working to reduce the energy they consume by using greener power supplies 
including solar energy.</p> 
<p> The first EARTH ANGEL Award winner was selected by a jury of 12 respected  
automotive journalists. Factors considered for the award included established 
present and future environmental initiatives sponsored or supported by the 
automaker; current hybrid electric, diesel and flex-fuel vehicles available to 
the public; and the automaker&rsquo;s position and mission on global warming.
</p> 
<p> The EARTH ANGEL Award was presented at the 12th Annual ICOTY Awards, which 
was one of the many highlights at the night&rsquo;s glitzy, black-tie affair 
held at the all-new MGM Grand Detroit on the eve of press week of the 2008 
North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). Bridgestone sponsored the 
inaugural award.</p>
