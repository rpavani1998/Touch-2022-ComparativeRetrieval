<p> WASHINGTON, April 17, 2012 -- <b>Hybrid and Electric Car Sales Also Jump 
Dramatically</b></p> 
<p>WASHINGTON, April 17, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --&nbsp;Clean diesel 
automobile sales in the United States increased an impressive 35 percent during 
the first quarter of 2012 continuing the strong gains in diesel car purchases 
in 2011, according to new sales information compiled byHybridCars.Com and Baum 
and Associates.</p> 
<p>(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120201/MM46474LOGO) </p> 
<p> The U.S. sales of clean diesel autos increased 39.6 percent in March 2012 
over March 2011, 42.9 percent in February, and 21.2 percent in January.</p> 
<p>During the first quarter, U.S. hybrid car sales increased 37.2 percent and 
the emerging plug-in electric car market saw a sales increase of 323 
percent.&nbsp; The overall automobile market increased 13.4 percent in 2012, 
according to the new sales information.</p> 
<p></p> <b>Month (2012 v. 2011)</b> <b>Clean Diesel +/-</b> <b>Hybrids +/-</b> 
<b>Overall Market +/-</b> <br>
 March 2012  +39.6%  +39.6%  +12.7% <br>

<p><b>Higher Fuel Prices Have Americans Seeking More Fuel Efficient Cars </b>
&quot;This 35 percent increase in clean diesel auto sales during the first 
quarter of 2012 is a continuation of the 27 percent sales jump in 2011,&quot; 
said Allen Schaeffer, the Executive Director of theDiesel Technology Forum.</p> 
<p>&quot;With higher fuel prices, Americans are seeking more fuel efficient 
cars so it's understandable that diesel and hybrid cars are showing such 
impressive sales increases.&nbsp;In addition, the new federal fuel efficiency 
standards that will required a 54.5 mpg average by 2025 will also boost clean 
diesel auto sales, asdiesel cars are 20 to 40 more fuel efficient than gasoline 
versions.</p> 
<p><b>Clean Diesel Autos Are Among the Most Environmentally Friendly Available 
</b>&quot;American drivers are also recognizing the environmental benefits of 
the new clean diesel technology,&quot; Schaeffer said.&nbsp; &quot;Earlier this 
month, the Mercedes-Benz S 250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY clean diesel received the 
prestigious'<i>2012 World Green Car'</i> award during the New York 
International Auto Show.&nbsp; This followed the January announcement that the 
Volkswagen Passat TDI clean diesel had been selected the<i>'2012 Earth, Wind 
&amp; Power Car of the Year for Most Earth Friendly'</i> automobile.</p> 
<p>&quot;I expect clean diesel auto sales to increase further as several new 
diesel cars are introduced in the U.S. market in the next year,&quot; Schaeffer 
said.</p> 
<p><b>Numerous New Clean Diesel Autos to Soon Be Available In U.S. </b>The 
2012 Porsche Cayenne clean diesel has just been introduced into the U.S. market 
and the following auto makers have announced plans to sell additional new clean 
diesel autos in the U.S.:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Audi announced that it would be selling an Audi A6, A8 and Q5 TDI diesel 
in the U.S. in 2013.&nbsp; The A4 may still see a diesel version in 2014 or 
even as early as 2013.</li> 
<li>Chrysler announced that it will be introducing a Jeep Grand Cherokee 
diesel in 2013 or 2014, and possibly other Jeep diesels later.&nbsp; They also 
plan a new version of the discontinued Dakota pickup that will include a 
diesel, but timing is uncertain.</li> 
<li>Ford will offer diesel and gasoline engines in the new Transit full-size 
commercial van that goes on sale in the U.S. next year.</li> 
<li>General Motors announced that a diesel version of the Cadillac ATS would 
available in the U.S. in the near future.&nbsp; A diesel version of the 
hot-sellingChevrolet Cruze will begin sales in the U.S. in 2013. </li> 
<li>Mazda will become the first Asian car manufacturer to sell diesel cars in 
the U.S. when it introduces its SKYACTIV-D 2.2-liter clean diesel engine 
here.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>The Mercedes S350 BlueTEC marks the return of the diesel-powered 
Mercedes-Benz S-Class to the United States in 2012 after a 17-year 
absence.&nbsp; Mercedes also still plans to bring a diesel in theGLK and 
C-class for a total of eight diesel models by 2014. </li> 
<li>The newly redesigned 2012 VW Beetle will once again feature a TDI diesel 
version with the possible introduction of a Tiguan diesel later.</li> </ul>
