<h2>Hybrid Watchdog:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrids vs. &quot;Clean Diesel&quot; &mdash; 
Tale of the Tape</h2> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>In an environment where American consumers are increasingly more concerned 
about the ecological, economic, and energy-related impacts of their travel, 
hybrid vehicles have garnered the lion&rsquo;s share of recent attention as a 
near-term solution to those challenges. Yet when it comes to fuel-efficient 
drivetrains, hybrids are not alone. U.S. interest in diesel engines for 
passenger vehicles has seen a recent resurgence, in part because of creative 
automotive engineering. A number of the performance and emissions pitfalls that 
plagued diesel technology over the years have been addressed, bringing the 
latest round of what automakers call &ldquo;clean diesel&rdquo; vehicles a 
newfound respect among automotive enthusiasts.</p> 
<p>Some of this new attention is warranted. Today&rsquo;s diesel cars are 
meeting emissions levels that&mdash;for a diesel vehicle&mdash;would have been 
hard to imagine a mere decade ago. Like some of their hybrid counterparts they 
also offer impressive fuel economy compared to many conventional vehicles on 
the road. Such information has prompted some to speculate about whether 
today&rsquo;s diesels might be deserving of the eco-friendly mantle currently 
held by efficient hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid.</p> 
<p>So how do today&rsquo;s diesels fare compared to today&rsquo;s most popular 
hybrids? This edition of the Hybrid Watchdog takes a closer examination of the 
issue, and identifies exactly which parameters to consider when making such 
comparisons. Let&rsquo;s dig in&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Under the Hood: Diesel Fuel Economy</strong><br>
One of the biggest 
draws of diesel technology is their impressive fuel economy. Diesels achieve 
higher mpgs (miles per gallon) due to two main factors. First, the compression 
ignition combustion process that occurs inside diesel engine cylinders is more 
efficient than the spark ignition process that occurs in gasoline engine 
cylinders, wasting less energy as the fuel is converted into mechanical motion.
</p> 
<p>Second is the fact that on a per-gallon basis, diesel fuel contains about 
13 percent more energy than gasoline. This higher energy density helps push the 
vehicle farther down road, getting it&mdash;quite literally&mdash;more miles 
per gallon. As we&rsquo;ll see shortly, however, the impressive fuel economy 
numbers of diesels don&rsquo;t tell the whole story when it comes to assessing 
other attributes such as global warming, or oil dependence performance, or air 
pollution.</p> 
<p>Global Warming Pollution<br>
When comparing the global warming performance 
of two vehicles, most consumers simply compare their respective fuel economies. 
While there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the 
pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the 
amount of fuel the vehicle burns. Generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle 
is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.</p> 
<p>While this is a good general rule, it is important to note that <em>using 
fuel economies to compare the global warming performance of two vehicles is 
only applicable when the two vehicles operate on the same fuel</em>. Different 
fuels have unique concentrations of carbon, in a similar way that, say, 
different types of soda contain different amounts of sugar. This &ldquo;carbon 
content&rdquo; affects how much CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere when the 
fuel is burned.</p> 
<p>Diesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than 
gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content. On a full fuel cycle basis 
(that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also 
the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel 
from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent 
more CO2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline. This 
characteristic of diesel fuel is why using a fuel economy comparison between 
gasoline and diesel vehicles to determine global warming benefits can be 
misleading. If a diesel vehicle consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline 
powered vehicle, for example, its global warming benefit would in reality only 
be about 15 percent better than the gasoline vehicle.</p> 
<p>Oil Dependence<br>
A similar story holds when it comes to oil dependence. 
According to the joint U.S. EPA-DOE website,www.fueleconomy.gov, approximately 
13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than 
to produce a gallon of gasoline.*&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, from an oil security 
standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn&rsquo;t 
capture the full picture. Using our previous example, a diesel vehicle that 
consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline-powered vehicle would, in fact, 
consume only 15 percent less crude oil than the gasoline vehicle.</p> 
<p>Air Pollution<br>
All vehicles sold today are tested in a laboratory for 
tailpipe emissions and given a certification level &mdash; a grade, effectively 
&mdash; that specifies how clean the vehicle is in the emissions of four major 
pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons, and 
particulate matter (PM). Today&rsquo;s &ldquo;clean diesels&rdquo; are 
certified to meet what&rsquo;s known as the federal &ldquo;Tier 2 bin 5&rdquo; 
emissions standard, along with an equivalent standard in California commonly 
known as &ldquo;LEV II&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Meeting the &ldquo;bin 5&rdquo; standard is a significant achievement for 
diesels which, because of the diesel combustion process, produces high levels 
of NOx and PM in the engine cylinders. However, the &ldquo;bin 5&rdquo; 
certification is an exceedingly common standard for today&rsquo;s gasoline 
vehicles. Most of today&rsquo;s hybrids and even some conventional gasoline 
vehicles are considerably cleaner, certified to &ldquo;bin 3,&rdquo; &ldquo;bin 
2,&rdquo; (the lower the bin number, the better for the environment) and even 
the near-zero-emission California &ldquo;PZEV&rdquo; certification.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Tale of the Tape<br>
</strong>So how do diesels fare against the 
efficient hybrids that currently hold the eco-friendly vehicle mantle? In 
short, hybrids still carry the day. While diesels offer impressive fuel economy 
and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, 
efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still 
besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts. Below is 
a sample comparison between two similar vehicles, one diesel and one a gasoline 
hybrid, that illustrates this point. Note, there are no diesel and hybrid 
models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major 
attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.
</p> 
<p><strong>Comparing the Environmental Performance of diesels and hybrids
</strong></p> 
<p><strong><br>
<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Miles Per Gallon (MPG):</strong> The mpg ratings for the civic 
hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel Jetta in highway driving (45 versus 
40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).&nbsp; This reflects the 
benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy 
performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.</p> 
<p>Overall, the hybrid Civic (42 mpg) out-performs the diesel Jetta (33 mpg) 
in combined city and highway fuel economy by 27 percent. It should be noted 
that a vehicle&rsquo;s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design 
decisions.&nbsp; For example, the diesel Jetta could have a better mpg, but the 
vehicle designers chose to achieve higher acceleration rather than better fuel 
economy.</p> 
<p><strong>Global Warming Pollution:</strong> The mpg values help you 
determine how far you can go on a gallon of fuel, but more information is 
needed to accurately determine the global warming impact of a vehicle. 
Comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a 
direct comparison between two vehicles, while the EPA greenhouse gas score 
shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Carbon Footprint:</strong> The carbon footprint provides an 
estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide 
equivalents (CO2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy 
efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and 
driving 15,000 miles annually.</p> 
<p>The Civic Hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of CO2-equivalent per year, 
while the Jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more 
global warming emissions.</p> 
<p><strong>EPA GHG Score:</strong> While the diesel Jetta might appear to be a 
global warming laggard based on the previous comparison, the EPA GHG score puts 
these emissions into a broader context. The GHG score ranks all vehicles on a 
scale of 1 to 10. Both the diesel Jetta and Civic Hybrid are top scorers when 
compared to all other available vehicles in the showroom. The Jetta receives an 
8 while the Civic Hybrid scores a 10.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Oil Dependence:</strong> Comparison of petroleum consumption 
estimates show that the diesel Jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum 
than the Civic Hybrid.</p> 
<p><strong>Air Pollution: </strong>EPA also provides a similar score for 
comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.&nbsp; The bin 2 
certification earns the Civic Hybrid a 9 on EPA&rsquo;s Air Pollution score, 
while the diesel Jetta&rsquo;s bin 5 certification earns it a 
middle-of-the-road score of 6.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion<br>
</strong>Environmentally speaking, today&rsquo;s 
diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer 
notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles. However, 
the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of 
today&rsquo;s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel 
counterparts. Nevertheless, diesels can offer global warming and petroleum 
reduction benefits compared to their conventional gasoline counterparts.</p> 
<p>Many new models of diesel and hybrids will be entering the marketplace in 
the coming years with varying levels of environmental performance. It will be 
up to the automakers to decide whether these technologies are used to their 
full potential to reduce emissions, or whether they&rsquo;re tapped to improve 
vehicle power and performance. When comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers 
should just be aware that &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in the categories of air 
pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a 
function of the vehicle&rsquo;s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its 
emissions control system and even of the fuel&rsquo;s chemical makeup.&nbsp;</p>
