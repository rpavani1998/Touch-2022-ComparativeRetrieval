<h5>Green Fleet Initiatives Gain Momentum Despite Cost Constraints</h5> 
<p>By Mike Antich<br>
 Most fleets want to be environmentally friendly, but 
are often hamstrung by fiscal constraints when procuring greener vehicles. But, 
as many fleets have shown, where there is a will, there is a way to meet fleet 
sustainability goals, despite fiscal austerity. Since most companies replace 
approximately one third of their fleet vehicles each year, they can tailor 
selectors to favor more fuel-efficient vehicles, so long as they are able to 
fulfill the fleet application.</p> 
<h5>Poor Truck Ergonomics 'Cramp' Fleet Productivity</h5> 
<p>By Mike Antich<br>
 A one-size-fits-all approach to truck specifications is 
an ergonomic minefield, which could have litigious consequences. In addition, 
there are increased field complaints about &ldquo;less-than-ergonomic&rdquo; 
upfit decisions. Besides health issues, poor ergonomics is also a key 
contributor to preventable accidents. Proactively resolving ergonomic issues 
can have a significant impact in reducing workers&rsquo; comp costs, improving 
productivity, and decreasing fatigue-induced driver errors.</p>

<p>By Chris Brown <br>

stolen. Over the weekend, Visa removed Global Payments from its PCI compliance 
list. What does that mean to you?</p> 
<h5>Ford Previews Fleet Vehicles for 2012 and Beyond</h5>

customers to show off the all-new 2013 Ford Fusion, discuss hybrid, electric 
and EcoBoost engine technologies, update plans for the Lincoln brand and talk
