<h2> WRIGHTBUS DOUBLE DECK HYBRID MAKES A BIG IMPRESSION IN BATH </h2> <br>

<br>Despite only entering service with First Group in Bath at the end of August 
this year, the Wrightbus Gemini 2 HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) Double Deck is 
already making a big impression in the historic town.<br>
<br>
Introduced by 
First Bristol, Somerset and Avon in Bath as part of the European CIVITAS 
Renaissance Initiative in partnership with Bath &amp; North East Somerset 
Council, the Hybrid powered Integral Double Deck bus developed by the Wright 
Group is the first vehicle of its type to enter service in the South West.<br>

<br>Initial operating data suggests that the vehicle is delivering fuel savings 
in excess of 30% as compared to diesel buses operating on the same three Park 
&amp; Ride routes in and around the city of Bath. Reaction from passengers 
using the service has been equally favourable.<br>
<br>
Part of the modular 
Gemini 2 product family that is also available in diesel (DL) form, the HEV 
Double Deck is an exceptionally environmentally-friendly vehicle, powered by 
just a 1.9 litre Turbo Diesel GM engine and a Siemens ELFA&reg; hybrid 
drivetrain. Its 37kWh Valence Lithium Ion batteries offer advanced energy 
storage for power captured by the vehicle&rsquo;s regenerative braking system, 
a feature much in evidence thanks to hilly terrain in and around the famous 
Roman city.<br>
<br>
With the huge capacity of the integrated battery system 
continually being recharged, once the bus reaches the town centre it can run 
almost entirely off battery power, meaning that the diesel engine is hardly 
being used and therefore fuel emissions are cut to an absolute minimum. This 
not only meets the emissions requirements for city centres that have been set 
out by the European CIVITAS Renaissance Initiative, but also provides 
passengers and driver alike with a smoother and quieter ride.<br>
<br>
The 
early success of the specially branded hybrid bus in Bath, two months into the 
six month trial in helping to improve air quality and further reduce emission 
levels, is sure to generate fresh renewed interest from other cities right 
across the UK.<br>
<br>
Leon Daniels, FirstGroup UK Bus Customer Service &amp; 
Communication Director said; &ldquo;Whilst London and one or two other big 
conurbations are implementing advanced hybrid bus technology, here is a case 
where air quality is being improved in an historic and 
environmentally-sensitive city and I&rsquo;m delighted the people of Bath are 
at the frontline of this cutting edge technology.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mark Nodder, 
Wright Group Managing Director commented; &ldquo;To date, Hybrid Electric 
Vehicle investment has been very London-centric, but two rounds of the Green 
Bus Fund and innovative schemes such as the CIVITAS Renaissance Project in Bath 
are providing an important and much welcomed incentive to a technology which is 
becoming increasingly mature and, hopefully within a foreseeable timeframe, 
increasingly mainstream.&rdquo; &nbsp; <br>
