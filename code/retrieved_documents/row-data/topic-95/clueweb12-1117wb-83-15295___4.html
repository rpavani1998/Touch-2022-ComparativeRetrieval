Gas Trucks<br>

<h1>Diesel vs. Gas Trucks</h1> 
<p>Fuel and maintenance costs drive decisions when it comes to selecting the 
type of engine to power your fleet. Since the time of steam power, engines have 
evolved to serve different purposes. Fleets have upgraded accordingly, and 
companies have stood by engines that work best for them.</p> 
<p>Today, businesses that operate fleets are beginning to experiment with new 
types of engines considered to be more fuel-efficient. City buses in Chicago, 
for example, are gradually moving toward hybrid and electric alternatives. 
However, the standard for most fleets of vehicles still comes down to the 
choice of diesel vs. gas trucks.</p> 
<p>Below, we have explained some of the key differences between diesel and 
gasoline engines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Difference</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Diesel&rdquo; simply refers to a type of internal combustion engine. 
To commence ignition, this system relies on the heat from compression to burn 
fuel that is injected into the engine&rsquo;s combustion chamber. Diesel 
engines were among the first developed and were originally designed to replace 
steam engines.</p> 
<p>By comparison, a gasoline engine uses a spark-ignition system to run solely 
on gasoline. The difference is how it mixes the fuel, air and a spark to 
trigger the combustion process. For gasoline engines, the fuel and air are 
mixed prior to combustion in the carburetor or via an electronic fuel injection 
system. Gasoline engines operate more quickly than diesel engines because of 
lighter components.</p> 
<p><strong>When to Choose a Diesel Engine Vehicle</strong></p> 
<p>As a rule of thumb, if your fleet is traveling shorter distances, gasoline 
is your better option, as diesel engines are better suited for long-distance 
travel. However, if your vehicle must haul heavy equipment or a trailer, even 
if the distance is short, a diesel truck engine could be preferable.</p> 
<p><strong>Economics</strong></p> 
<p>Diesel fuel is generally more expensive than gasoline, but not by much. In 
October 2011, the national average showed a difference of about 30 cents per 
gallon. The difference is all but wiped out when you consider the efficiency of 
the fuel you are using. Diesel engines, especially when used for long 
distances, are considerably more efficient, and diesel fuel could actually end 
up costing less. By contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets 
that make shorter trips.</p> 
<p><strong>Environmental Considerations</strong></p> 
<p>There is a growing concern regarding the environmental implications of 
today&rsquo;s transportation options. Governments worldwide are inclined to 
reward businesses that opt for newer technology, such as hybrid engines and 
electric vehicles. However, the debate between diesel and gasoline engines as 
the more environmentally friendly option is unsettled.</p> 
<p>Naturally, the vapors released by diesel engines have been the cause of 
much of the debate. While it&rsquo;s true that modern diesel engines have 
significantly reduced the vapors they emit, the levels are still higher than 
with gasoline engines. It&rsquo;s worth noting, however, that gasoline engines 
release more carbon dioxide, which has been said to contribute to global 
climate change.</p> 
<p>Another argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines 
are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly 
option for certain transportation fleets.</p> 
<p>When making your decision, consider the purpose of your fleet and weigh the 
pros and cons of each.</p>
