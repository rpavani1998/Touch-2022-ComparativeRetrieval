<h2>Scottish shipbuilder to create &pound;20 million environmentally friendly 
ferries</h2> <br>

<p>Scottish firm Ferguson Shipbuilders has been chosen by the Scottish 
Government as the preferred bidder to build the world&rsquo;s first 
environmentally friendly ferries in a deal worth over &pound;20 million.</p> 
<p>The roll-on roll-off passenger and vehicle ferries will be driven by a 
low-carbon hybrid system combining diesel electric and battery power.</p> 
<p>The two new ferries will come into operation in 2013 and will be cleaner, 
quieter and cheaper to operate and maintain. The hybrid propulsion systems will 
reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.</p> 
<p>Each will accommodate 150 passengers and 23 cars or two HGVs on the short 
crossing routes around the Clyde and Hebrides operated by Clyde and Hebrides 
Ferry Services, CalMac Ferries, starting with the Sconser-Raasay route on Skye.
</p> 
<p>The ferries will recharge their batteries over night while moored on the 
islands they serve and will in future, it is anticipated, use locally generated 
wind, wave or solar power.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;[The project] will help Scotland to meet our ambitious climate 
change targets, and demonstrates the vast economic potential of developing 
green technology and moving to a low carbon economy,&rdquo; says Scottish 
Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Alex Neil, who 
made the announcement.</p>
