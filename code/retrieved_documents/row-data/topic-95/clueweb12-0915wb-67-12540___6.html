<h2>TDI Academy: Clean Diesel vs. Hybrid</h2> 
<p><br>
<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
 We realize there&rsquo;s an awful 
lot of hype out there about new powertrains that promise to solve a long list 
of our planet&rsquo;s most pressing problems, from global warming to the 
nationwide shortage of buffalo wings.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 So we&rsquo;re going to give it to you straight. Because we figure 
that if we lay out the pros and cons of the two main alternatives &mdash; 
gasoline-electric hybrids and clean diesels &mdash; you&rsquo;re smart enough 
to reach your own conclusions. Of course, we&rsquo;re also pretty confident
Volkswagen&rsquo;s TDI clean diesel models will look pretty good by comparison.
<br> </p> 
<p><br>
 That understandable bias aside, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at 
these two popular car choices:<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Gasoline-Electric Hybrids<br>
</strong> The first thing you 
should know about hybrid vehicles, which combine a traditional gasoline engine 
with a battery pack and one or more electric motors, is that they&rsquo;re not 
all created equal.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 Generally speaking, there are two types: Mild hybrids like the Honda 
Civic Hybrid use their electric motors mainly to boost the performance of their 
smallish gasoline engine, which means they typically get better mileage on the 
highway than they do around town. Full hybrids like the Toyota Prius, on the 
other hand, can operate on battery power alone for short distances, making them 
more fuel-efficient in stop-and-go traffic than they are on the highway. While 
several hybrid models place highly on the EPA&rsquo;s list of the greenest 
vehicles on the road, there are several issues you should be aware of:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>No one expects a hybrid to be all that exciting to drive, but be aware 
that most also have small quirks&mdash;like a surging feeling when you step on 
the brake pedal&mdash;that owners say takes some getting used to.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that a &ldquo;Hybrid&rdquo; badge 
automatically means a particular model is the best choice for the environment. 
In fact, there are a number of new non-hybrid models on the road that are 
actually more fuel-efficient and/or less-polluting than some hybrids.</li> 
<li>The greater complexity of hybrid powertrains means there&rsquo;s more that 
can go wrong. This includes replacing the vehicle&rsquo;s large, expensive 
battery pack at the end of its useful life.</li> 
<li>Check to see if the federal government&rsquo;s Alternative Motor Vehicle 
tax creditis still available on the hybrid you&rsquo;re considering. Many of 
the most popular models no longer qualify.</li> </ul> 
<p><br>
<strong>TDI Clean Diesel<br>
</strong> When it comes right down to it, 
Volkswagen&rsquo;s new generation of turbocharged &ldquo;clean diesel&rdquo; 
models combine impressive fuel economy* with the simplicity and durability of 
diesel engines. In addition, theTDI engines in both the Jetta sedan, SportWagen 
and theTouareg SUV are certified to meet the same tough government emission 
standards&mdash;known as &ldquo;Tier 2 Bin 5&rdquo;&mdash;as the cleanest 
gasoline-electric hybrids.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 Finally, the abundant low-end torque TDI engines&mdash;combined with 
Volkswagen&rsquo;s sporty European handling&mdash;make Volkswagen&rsquo;s three 
clean diesel models hands-down winners in the fun-to-drive department. Other 
factors to consider:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Because of their sturdier construction, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for diesel 
engines to still be going strong after 250,000 miles with little more than 
regular maintenance (which is now complementary on all VW models for the first 
36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first**).</li> 
<li>With a 14.5-gallon fuel tank and EPA estimates of 41 mpg on the highway*, 
the Jetta TDI can go nearly 600 miles on a single fill-up. Of course, this also 
depends on your driving style and the type of roads you travel.</li> 
<li>While gasoline and diesel prices fluctuate, TDI models&rsquo; fuel economy 
numbers mean you&rsquo;re still likely to end up spending less at the pump 
compared to some hybrids.</li> 
<li>All three Volkswagen TDI models are still eligible for the federal 
government&rsquo;sAdvanced Lean Burn Technology Motor Vehicle tax credits of up 
to $1,300, depending on the model you purchase.***</li> </ul> 
<p>*Jetta TDI EPA estimates 30 mpg city / 41 mpg highway. Your mileage will 
vary.</p> 
<p>**The Volkswagen Carefree Maintenance Program covers the vehicle&rsquo;s 
10K, 20K and 30K scheduled maintenance intervals except for the Volkswagen 
Routan. The Routan Carefree Maintenance Program covers the vehicle&rsquo;s 6K, 
12K, 18K, 24K, 30K and 36K scheduled maintenance intervals. Coverage is during 
the term of the new vehicle limited warranty, at no additional charge. The 
program covers 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. See dealer or 
vehicle maintenance program booklet for details. Does not include routine wear 
and tear on parts such as brakes, tires, wiper blades, light bulbs, etc.</p> 
<p>***Tax credit submitted under Notice 2006-9 and Internal Revenue Cod, 
Section 30B relative to the 2009 Volkswagen Jetta 2.0L TDI Sedan and SportWagen 
and Touareg 2 TDI. Available to taxpayers who purchased a qualified vehicle on 
or before December 31, 2010. Leased vehicles are not eligible for the tax 
credit. Only a limited number of full tax credits are available. Please consult 
a tax professional for more information or go tohttp://www.irs.gov</p> <br>

<p>My TDI can eat Hybrids for breakfast but, they give her such terrible 
&ldquo;gas.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s so funny. I just received a custom license plate frame I 
ordered for my 09 Jetta TDi that says &ldquo;Turbo Diesels Eat Hybrids For 
Lunch&rdquo;</p> <br>

<p>We own a Prius and a Jetta TDI. The Prius is a wonderful car, but it is 
BORING.</p> <br>

<p>great article. wow, you really made me think twice about buying a hybrid. 
For a moment, I was nearly fooled into helping save the planet, until you 
reminded me looking great and having fun was much more important.</p> 
<p>Would love to hang out and chat, but I&rsquo;ve got to rush out and buy 
myself a gas guzzling &lsquo;mean machine&rsquo; instead and burn some rubber.

<p>The initiative taken for the concern is very serious and need an attention 
of every one. This is the concern which exists in the society and needs to be 
eliminated from the society as soon as possible.<br>

<p>2011 Jetta Sportswagon averaging 43-50 mpg. I drive about 112 miles per day 
to work 85% highway.</p> <br>

<p>I routinely get over 600 miles out of 12 gallons of diesel fuel. My fill up 
today was 642 miles.</p> <br>

<p>Just bought a 2011 tdi sportsawagon yesterday. I love it so far. Anyone 
here try using bio diesel??? B20, B5 or B100???</p> <br>

<p>I am not lucky enough to drive my 2011 Jetta TDI on the highway. Instead I 
get to drive in and around Washington DC metro traffic. That said, I generally 
average between 38 to 43 mpg over a 27 mile range. I have seen numbers over 47 
when I took it out for a spin without traffic (average 65 mph)</p> <br>

<p>I love my Jetta TDI! I recently drove from clearwater FL To Stafford 
Virginia with trunk fully loaded, 3 hefty adults and a child plus snacks. Made 
it there in about 20 gallons of fuel driving 75-80mph..</p> <br>

<p>Bought hail damaged 1999.5 MKIV hatchback with 160K, cheap. Used it up 
running pizza&rsquo;s in Minnesota and chasing wave producing weather systems 
around Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Raised the odometer up to 220K. Parked 
it running strong with over 120K on it&rsquo;s second timing belt and very 
tired and worn chassis. I am now running 2003 MKIV wagon with the odometer 
reaching 230K. Drove over 800 miles on a tank with user friendly tips, all 
STOCK power plant, driving from Minneapolis,Mn to Marquette, Mi. Enough space 
to haul a 9&prime;4&Prime; surf board in a hatchback, the stationwagon can 
carry a 10 foot board, INSIDE! Not to mention the fastest I have ever covered a 
paved surface was in these vehicle.</p> 
<p>With snow tires the front wheel drive can bust thru major drifts. I was 
never stuck while delivering pizza&rsquo;s in Minnesota winters!</p> 
<p>I now know and smile with VW &ldquo;Fahrvergn&uuml;gen!&rdquo;</p> <br>
