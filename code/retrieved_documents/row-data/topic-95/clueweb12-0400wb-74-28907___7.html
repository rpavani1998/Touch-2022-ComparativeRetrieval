<h1>Plug-in Hybrid Electric School Bus</h1> 
<p><br>
</p> <br>

<h3>11 States Are First in the Nation to Receive Hybrid School Buses as IC 
Corporation Awarded Bid by Advanced EnergyConsortium <br>
<br>
<em>Corporation 
Works with Enova Systems to Supply First Hybrid School Buses That Can Attain Up 
To 40 Percent Increase in Fuel Efficiency</em> </h3> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>RENO, Nev. (July 25, 2006) &#150; Eleven states will be getting a higher 
grade for investing in energy-efficiency this school year. New York, 
California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Arkansas, Iowa and Washington will be the first states in the nation 
to receive hybrid school buses. Through its Plug-In Hybrid Electric School Bus 
Project, Advanced Energy, a Raleigh, N.C.-based nonprofit corporation, 
initiated a buyer&#146;s consortium of school districts, state energy agencies 
and student transportation providers. After issuing nationwideRequest for 
Proposals (RFPs)  for hybrid school buses in June 2006, Advanced Energy 
announced today at the 13th Annual School Transportation News Expo that IC 
Corporation, the nation&#146;s largest school bus manufacturer, won the bid and 
will provide up to 19 hybrid school buses to those 11 states.</p> 
<p>&#147;This project provides operational benefits to school districts, while 
also providing the reduced emissions desired by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and a valuable return on investment to school boards,&#148; 
said Ewan Pritchard, P.E., Advanced Energy&#146;s hybrid program manager. 
&#147;This bid award is the result of several years of collaborative effort 
among manufacturers, school districts and government agencies to change the 
school bus market.&#148;</p> 
<p>IC Corporation, in collaboration with Enova Systems, unveiled the 
nation&#146;s first hybrid school bus two weeks ago at the New York Association 
of Pupil Transportation (NYAPT) Show. The hybrid school bus is expected to 
attain a 40 percent increase in fuel efficiency, which becomes even more 
essential with the rising fuel costs affecting many school districts.</p> 
<p>&#147;With fuel prices near all-time highs, new innovations in hybrid 
technology are needed to help customers in the school bus industry keep their 
operating costs lower,&#148; said Michael Cancelliere, vice president and 
general manager of IC Corporation. &#147;We&#146;re proud that Advanced Energy 
recognizes the need to help our nation&#146;s school districts with 
energy-efficient school buses. In addition, even though current International 
diesel engines on many existing school buses produce no visible smoke and 
minimal emissions, the hybrid program will reduce engine emissions even 
further.&#148;</p> 
<p>These members of Advanced Energy&#146;s buyers&#146; consortium are 
currently scheduled to receive buses:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (2 buses) </li> 
<li>South Carolina Department of Educations (2 buses) </li> 
<li>State of New York (2 buses) </li> 
<li>Florida Department of Education (2 buses) </li> 
<li>Napa Valley Unified School District, Napa Valley, Calif. (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Durham School Services, Everett, Wash. (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Lake Chelan School District, Chelan, Wash. (1 bus) </li> 
<li>City of Seattle (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Little Rock, Ark., School District (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Sigourney Community School District, Sigourney, Iowa (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Nevada Community Schools, Nevada, Iowa (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Killeen Independent School District, Texas (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Austin Independent School District, Texas (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Fairfax County, Va. (1 bus) </li> 
<li>Jennings Transportation, Nazareth, Pa. (1 bus) </li> </ul> 
<p>The hybrid school bus project features Enova's post-transmission 
80-kilowatt Hybrid Drive System and was extensively tested and evaluated at IC 
Corporation&#146;s research and technology facility in Fort Wayne, Ind. The 
initial powertrain for the hybrid school bus will couple an International&reg; 
VT365 V8 diesel engine with the 80-kilowatt hybrid-electric powertrain, 
incorporating a transmission, batteries and an electric motor. The system is 
based on a parallel architecture, allowing the system to utilize both diesel 
and electric power in a highly efficient manner.</p> 
<p>The system recovers kinetic energy during regenerative braking, charging 
the batteries while the bus is slowing down. This provides additional power for 
acceleration, making school buses ideal candidates for hybrid technology 
because of the frequent stops and starts they perform along their daily routes.
</p> 
<p>&#147;IC Corporation is committed to environmental leadership and 
delivering value to our customers,&#148; said Cancelliere. &#147;We believe 
that diesel-electric hybrid technology can be made commercially viable for the 
school bus industry and this collaboration is the next step in making that a 
reality.&#148;</p> 
<p>Funding to support Advanced Energy&#146;s initiative has come from North 
Carolina&#146;s electric utilities (Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Dominion 
North Carolina Power and North Carolina electric cooperatives) and the State 
Energy Office in North Carolina.</p> 
<p>&#147;Duke Energy is proud to support research and market development of 
alternative and more energy efficient technologies,&#148; said Ellen Ruff, 
president of Duke Energy Carolinas. &#147;The hybrid electric school bus 
project is an exciting example of how key stakeholders from the utility 
industry, business and government can form partnerships that produce great 
benefits for communities in which we live.&#148;</p> 
<p>Advanced Energy is also welcoming additional funding at the state and 
private level to expand this program to more school districts and other states.

<p>The hybrid bus announcement is the continuation of research and development 
for new technology in a number of different vehicles. IC Corporation&#146;s 
parent company, International Truck and Engine Corporation, is working 
extensively on hybrid trucks for the utility and delivery industries.</p>
