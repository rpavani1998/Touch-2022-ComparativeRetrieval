<h2> Environmentally Friendly / Green Alternative Fuels</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li> The description &ldquo;Alternative fuels&rdquo; used in this section 
refers to sources of energy, other than petrol and standard diesel, that can be 
utilised to power a vehicle and which are derived from renewable or sustainable 
sources.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Alternative fuels that can be used to power a vehice fall into three main 
catagories: Biofuels,&nbsp;Hydrogen and Natural Gas.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Note: No fuel other than that recommended by the manufacturer should be 
used in a vehicle.<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Biofuels<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 3.2.1&nbsp; Introduction<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> A biofuel is a gas, solid or liquid fuel that has been produced from a 
recently living organism or its metabolic by-product.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Biofuels used in vehicles are usually in either a liquid or gas form.<br>

<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Sources of biofuels include sugar cane/beet, a range of vegetable oils, 
algae, animal fats and sewage.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The two main &ldquo;first-generation&rdquo; biofuels have been 
bio-ethanol and bio-diesel. These were made mainly from vegetable oils, starch 
and sugar.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> More recently &ldquo;second-generation&rdquo; biofuels are being produced 
using &ldquo;biomass to liquid&rdquo; technology, including biomethanol, 
biohydrogen, HTU diesel and Fischer-Tropsch diesel.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Early users of bio-ethanol have included Nickolaus Otto (for combustion 
engines he built in the1860s) and Henry Ford (originally for his famous Model T 
car in the early1900s).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In the 1890s Rudolf Diesel conceived his diesel engine to run on peanut 
oil. &nbsp; <br>
</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 3.2.2 &nbsp; Biodiesel<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Biodiesel can be produced from any fat or oil using a process called 
&ldquo;transesterification&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Vegetable oil could be used in older indirect injection system diesel 
engines when operated in hotter climates.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Nowadays vegetable oil has to be processed into&nbsp; biodiesel before it 
can be used in a modern diesel engine.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is the most commonly used biofuel in Europe.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is currently mainly manufactured from vegetable oils and has an energy 
content that is about 10% lower than that of petroleum diesel.<br>
<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> EN 14214 is the common international standard for biodiesel. A 
&quot;B&quot; factor is used to indicate the level of biodiesel in a fuel 
mixture. B40 indicating the fuel contains 40% biodiesel, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Biodiesel can be used as B100 or blended with petroleum diesel in most 
modern diesel engines.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 2006 Soybean and rapeseed oils accounted for about 90% of all 
biodiesel.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Other sources include, but are not limited to, sunflower, mustard, 
canola, palm oil, hemp, algae and jatropha.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<li> 
<p>3.2.3&nbsp; Ethanol<br>
</p> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Ethanol is ethyl alcohol and it is the world&rsquo;s most commonly used 
biofuel. Bio-ethanol is typically produced from crops such as sugar cane/beet, 
wheat and corn.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Note: Ethanol can also be produced from other sources, such as petroleum 
and coal.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 2007 countries with bio-ethanol programmes include Brazil, China, 
Columbia, Sweden and the USA.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Subject to the suitability of the engine it can be used as an alternative 
to, or blended with, unleaded petrol. An &ldquo;E&rdquo; number is used to 
indicate the petrol to ethanol ratio.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> E85, for example, representing a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 
percent petrol.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Ethanol, with water content of not more than 1%, can be blended with 
petrol in varying ratios.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> E10, sometimes called gasohol, can be used in the engines of most modern 
cars.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In February 2006 E20 became the standard ethanol-petrol mixture sold in 
Brazil.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 2007 Brazil was the world&rsquo;s largest producer of ethanol, which 
it derives from sugar cane.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Cars can be made to run on E100 but problems have been&nbsp; encountered 
starting the engine when the temperature is below 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
<br><br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Ethanol contains about 27% less energy than petrol (84,000 BTUs per US 
gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Cars running on ethanol currently use more fuel per mile than those 
running on petrol. Differences of up to 15% have been reported. Check this % .
<br><br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Fuel economy is expected to improve significantly as higher compression 
engines designed to run only on E100 become available.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul> 
<li> 3.2.4 &nbsp; Butanol<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Butanol is an alcohol fuel and can be produced from the same crops as 
ethanol; mainly sugar cane/beet, wheat and corn. It can also be produced from 
fossil fuels.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Butanol contains about 4.3% less energy than petrol (110,000 BTUs per US 
gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is less corrosive than ethanol.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 2006 no production vehicles were known to be approved for use with 
100% butanol. Information on butanol-petrol blends/ratios, level of production, 
usage, etc. required.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<li> 3.2.5 &nbsp; Methanol<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Methanol is methyl alcohol. It is frequently referred to as wood alcohol. 
<br><br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is currently (2007) more cost effective to derive methanol from the 
natural gas methane.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It can also be produced from light petroleum products and coal.<br>
<br>

<br></li> 
<li> When produced from a biomass it is called biomethanol.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Methanol is much less flammable than petrol and this has limited its use 
as fuel for internal combustion engines.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Methanol contains about 45% less energy than petrol (63,000 BTUs per US 
gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Methanol has been used as a fuel for fuel cells. See Green Cars, Section 
8.7 .&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Methanol is corrosive to certain metals, including aluminium.&nbsp; <br>

<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Pure methanol has been used in certain racing cars since the 1960s, 
including the American Indianapolis 500 event up to the end of the2005 season. 
It has also been used in drag racers.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<li> 3.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; Yield of Oil from Crops&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Note: All figures are in US gallons per acre (4,840 square yards or about 
4,050 square metres).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Corn (18), Soybean (48), Peanuts (113), Rapeseed (127), Jatropha (202), 
Oil Palm (635) and Algae (10,000).<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Algae, which has a natural oil content of more than 50%, produces over 
200 times more oil per acre than soybeans.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> One report indicated that if America relied soley upon soybean to provide 
all it&rsquo;s current transportation and heating needs, the crop would occupy 
an area equal to twice the size of the country. <br>
</li> </ul> </ul> 
<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 3.3.1 &nbsp; Vehicle Fuel<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Hydrogen, typically stored as a liquid and used as a gas, can be used as 
a fuel in:<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> A slightly modified version of the petrol powered internal combustion 
engine.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A fuel cell.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> </ul> 
<li> 3.3.2 &nbsp; Hydrogen Data<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element in the universe. It is 
designated &ldquo;atomic number 1&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> At normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures hydrogen is a flammable 
gas.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is a solid between absolute zero of minus 273.16 degrees C and its 
melting point of minus 259.34 degrees C, when it becomes a liquid.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It remains a liquid in the small band of 6.47 degrees C, until it rises 
to its boiling point of minus 252.87 degrees C.Note: Water has a boiling point 
of plus 100 degrees C.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is usually stored as a liquid because when it is converted to gas, 
hydrogen expands and takes up about 840 times more space.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is the lightest of the gases. About one-fifteenth the weight of air.
<br><br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<li> 3.3.3 &nbsp; Hydrogen Production&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> On our planet hydrogen exists mainly as part of other compounds and has 
to be extracted from them; such as water, fossil fuels, natural gas and&nbsp; 
coal. It is therefore a manufactured fuel.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 2006 extracting hydrogen consumed about 60% more energy than the 
resulting hydrogen provided.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Two of the most common ways of producing hydrogen are by steam reforming 
and electrolysis.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Steam reforming, mainly from natural gas, is currently the most cost 
effective and hence the most popular method.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Electrolysis, which extracts hydrogen from water, is currently a much 
more expensive process.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> For every one litre of petrol about four times the amount of liquid 
hydrogen is required to obtain the same amount of energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> To store liquid hydrogen at between minus 259.34&nbsp; and minus 252.87 
degrees C it must be kept in a pressurised and thermally insulated container.
<br><br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Due to the very low temperatures involved liquid hydrogen will slowly 
evaporate from its container.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<li> 3.3.4 &nbsp; Cars Using Hydrogen<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<ul> 
<li> For cars using hydrogen powered fuel cells see Green Cars, Section 8.<br>

<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> BMW: BMW&rsquo;s Hydrogen 7 car has an internal combustion engine that 
can run on petrol or hydrogen. When was it first produced?<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The car was powered by a 350 hp (260 kW) 12-cylinder engine.&nbsp; <br>

<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Mazda: In 2004 Mazda introduced the RX-4 Hydrogen RE, rotary engined, 
concept car. It was designed to run on petrol or hydrogen.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The car has a maximum range of 341 miles (546 km) when running on petrol 
or 62 miles (99 km) when running on hydrogen.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In March 2006 Mazda started to deliver these cars to customers.<br>
<br>
