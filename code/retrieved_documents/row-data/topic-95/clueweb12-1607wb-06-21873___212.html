<h3>Enova Systems Delivers Electric Drive Systems to Optare Plc</h3> 
<h3>120kW Systems to power All Electric Solo Bus</h3> 
<p>April 10, 2012</p> 
<p>TORRANCE, CA April 9th, 2012 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE 
AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of proprietary hybrid 
electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system components for the 
emerging green commercial vehicle market, is pleased to announce that it has 
delivered 4 incremental 120kW drive systems to Optare Plc for integration into 
their Solo Electric Bus. Optare has chosen Enova as the production drive system 
supplier for their all electric buses. Optare designs, manufactures and sells 
single deck and double deck buses and mini coaches. Its buses operate in the 
UK, Continental Europe, and North America.</p> 
<p>Mike Staran, Enova President and CEO said &ldquo;Despite the industry 
downturn, Enova continues to ship product to core and incremental customers. We 
will continue this path as well as mature other initiatives that are intended 
to improve distribution channels.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Additionally, and announced on March 23, 2012, commuters and bus passengers 
across England will see more eco-friendly buses on the roads, congestion 
reduced and services upgraded, thanks to a new &pound;101 million package of 
improvements approved by Local Transport Minister Norman Baker. Five bus 
manufacturers will benefit from orders for their eco-friendly hybrid, electric 
and gas buses. They comprise: Volvo, Wrightbus, Optare,MAN and Alexander Dennis 
Limited, all of which are based in, or partly in, the UK.</p> 
<p>Based on the award-winning Solo low-floor bus, of which over 4,000 are in 
service worldwide, the Solo EV produces zero tailpipe emissions. The model is 
based on a standard 27-seat 8.8 meter Solo, but the technology can be used on 
other models in the Optare range with higher passenger capacities. The Solo EV 
has been designed to perform exactly like a standard diesel powered bus, except 
that it is smoother, quieter and cleaner. It is completely traffic compatible, 
with good acceleration and hill climbing capabilities and a top speed of up to 
90 km/hour. On a full charge it has a range of around 110-130 kilometers 
depending on load factors and topography.</p> 
<p>Recently Optare announced that their long term future has been secured due 
to a refinancing agreement. The deal involved Ashok Leyland increasing its 
holding in Optare to 75.1% allowing Optare to become fully integrated in 
Ashok&rsquo;s ambitious global bus strategy which seeks to maintain and improve 
on its top fifth place amongst the world&rsquo;s bus makers. Ashok Leyland is 
the flagship of the Hinduja Group and a leading Indian commercial vehicle 
manufacturing company based in Chennai, selling approximately 94,000 vehicles 
and about 17,000 engines annually and is the second largest commercial vehicle 
company in India in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment, with a 
market share of about 25.7% in 2010/2011. Ashok is a market leader in the 
Indian bus market selling over 23,000 buses annually. The sales turnover of 
Ashok in 2010-11 was US $ 2.5 billion. Ashok has seven plants in India, one in 
the Czech Republic and one in the Middle East with a current global capacity of 
over 150,000 buses and trucks. In 2006 Ashok became the first automobile 
company in India to achieve the internationally renowned TS16949 certification.

<h3>Enova Announces Results for Year Ended December 31, 2011</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>April 3, 2012</p> 
<p>TORRANCE, CA April 3, 2012 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE 
AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS) (&ldquo;Enova&rdquo; or &ldquo;the 
Company&rdquo;), a leading developer of proprietary hybrid electric and 
all-electric drive systems and drive system components for the emerging green 
commercial vehicle market, announced its 2011 financial results on Friday, 
March 30, 2012. The company reported revenues of $6.6M and gross margins of 
3.9%, despite a significant downturn in the overall electric and hybrid market.
</p> 
<p>FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:<br>
 &acirc;&#128;&cent; Annual revenue was $6.6M in 
2011, a decrease of 23% from $8.6M in 2010 and Q4 2011 revenue was $638,000, a 
decrease of $3.1M from $3.7M for the same period in 2010. Customer orders 
decreased dramatically in the second half of the year due to tightened 
government and school district budgets, which resulted in a decrease in orders 
for our customers&rsquo; vehicles.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Gross profit decreased to $0.3M in 2011 from $1.4M in 
2010, and, in Q4, we swung to a gross loss of $618,000 from gross profit of 
$751,000 in the same period in 2010. Margins decreased, in particular in the 
second half of 2011, due to the lower sales base and our decision to record an 
increase in the inventory valuation reserve at year end.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Overall, annual gross margin was 3.9% in 2011, down 
from 16.5% in 2010 and the gross margin in Q4 2011 decreased to a negative 97% 
compared to a positive margin of 20% for the same period in 2010.<br>
 Enova 
President andCEO Mike Staran stated, &ldquo;With many of our suppliers and 
competitors facing insolvency and other crisis-type issues, we are encouraged 
with the announced initiatives we have made in extremely difficult market 
conditions. By remaining diligent in maturing what we consider game-changers 
such as Green For Free&acirc;&#132;&cent;, we believe that we have strengthened 
our position with our core customers, as well as begun to establish better 
control over the distribution channels in our market segment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Going Concern<br>
 Enova&rsquo;s annual report on 10-K for 2011 filed with 
theSEC included an audit opinion containing a going concern qualification. This 
announcement is being made in compliance with Section 401(h) and Section 610(b) 
of theNYSE Amex Company Guide which require a NYSE Amex listed issuer receiving 
an audit opinion with a going concern qualification to make a public 
announcement to that effect.</p> 
<p>2011 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:<br>
 Some highlights of our accomplishments in 2011 
include:</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Green For Free&acirc;&#132;&cent;. In November 2011, 
Enova announced its Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program, which is 
designed to allow fleet executives to operate full 100% electric commercial 
vehicles (EVs) for similar life cycle costs as those of diesel-powered 
commercial vehicles. The anticipated savings fleets are expected to realize 
from the reduced maintenance and fuel cost of electricity of the electric 
vehicles are used over a period of time to cover the incremental expense for 
the technology. Fleet vehicles targeted with the Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program stand out as possessing unique characteristics 
that make them clear beneficiaries of electric drive technology. With more than 
16.3 million vehicles in operation, the nation&rsquo;s fleets possess enough 
capacity to drive initial ramp-up scale in the EVOEM supply chains. We believe 
this is the first program that is engineered to eliminate the overall 
incremental costs associated with buying and operating an all-electric vehicle, 
making the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program attractive to fleets that 
are both large and small. Enova andFCCC anticipate traction regarding this 
initiative,and expect to showcase further details at multiple events in 2012, 
including the recentNTEA Work Truck show and the upcoming EVS 26 conference, to 
be held in May at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation 
(&ldquo;FCCC&rdquo;), a division of Daimler Trucks North America. Enova andFCCC 
began deploying new and retrofit all-electric vehicles to major fleet customers 
in 2011. The resulting integration of our all-electric drive system into the 
MT-45 chassis providesFCCC an all-electric product offering: the FCCC MT-EV. 
The MT-EV (theFCCC model name) chassis boasts a GVWR of 14,000 to 19,500 lbs. 
The durable steel straight-rail chassis frame reduces flex and bowing to 
minimize stress while carrying heavy payloads. The quiet operation of the 
all-electric MT-EV also makes for an enjoyable driver experience. The MT-EV has 
a flat-leaf spring front and rear suspension, allowing for a smooth, solid ride 
that minimizes cargo shifts on uneven road surfaces. Enova andFCCC also jointly 
announced intentions to deploy 3,000 vehicles via the Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program (described above).FCCC has begun, in early 
2012, an aggressive campaign to exploit future EV sales by showcasing the 
Enova/FCCC EV step van at numerous events on the West Coast, as well as the 
recentNTEA Work Truck show in Indianapolis. We currently are awaiting 
FCCC&rsquo;s decision on battery selection for this high volume initiative.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; First Auto Works (&ldquo;FAW&rdquo;). Enova continues 
to supplyFAW drive systems for their hybrid buses. Since the 2008 Olympics in 
Beijing, Enova Systems and First Auto Works have deployed nearly 500 vehicles, 
all utilizing Enova&rsquo;s pre-transmission hybrid drive system components. 
First Auto Works is one of China&rsquo;s largest vehicle producers, 
manufacturing in excess of 1,000,000 vehicles annually. The Enova drive system 
is integrated and branded under the name of Jiefang CA6120URH hybrid. The 
Jiefang 40 ft. long hybrid city bus can carry up to 103 passengers and travel 
at a speeds of over 50 miles per hour. With the Enova hybrid system components, 
the Jiefang bus meets EuroIII emission standards, consumes only 7.84 miles per 
gallon, and achieves a reduction of 20 percent in harmful emissions. Enova has 
recently shipped an already announced order of fifty (50) systems in Q4 2011 
and is working on additional incremental orders in 2012.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; U.S. General Services Administration 
(&ldquo;GSA&rdquo;).GSA extended its contract with Enova as the exclusive 
supplier contracted for the all-electric step van.GSA procures vehicles for 
government agencies and the armed forces. Under this contract, Enova will 
coordinate the supply of MT-EV all-electric walk-in step vans toGSA under the 
Cargo Vans category. Enova continues to benefit from federal fleet penetration 
viaGSA with the Smith Newton product offering in the Medium and Heavy Duty 
vehicle category.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Remy Inc (&ldquo;Remy&rdquo;). Enova and Remy signed a 
long-term electric motor supply agreement in March 2012. Under the five-year 
agreement, Remy will provide its electric motors to Enova for its all-electric 
drive systems. Remy motors feature the company&rsquo;s patented High Voltage 
Hairpin (HVH) winding technology, which is claimed to increase torque and power 
density for greater speed and range in electric vehicles.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Smith Electric Vehicles N.A. Inc. 
(&ldquo;Smith&rdquo;). Enova continues to supply Smith with electric drive 
systems. Smith has deployed several hundred vehicles utilizing Enova&rsquo;s 
electric drive system. Smith most recently announced its intention to deploy 
vehicles in the all-electric school bus sector. The 42-passenger Newton school 
bus travels up to 100 miles on a single charge at speeds of up to 50 mph, and 
is intended for the fixed routes in urban areas most school buses take each day.
</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&cent; Optare plc (&ldquo;Optare&rdquo;). Optare awarded Enova 
a contract as the production drive system supplier for their all electric 
buses. Enova has shipped systems to Optare that are currently being integrated 
into buses. Optare designs, manufactures and sells single deck and double deck 
buses and mini coaches. It&rsquo;s buses operate in the UK, Continental Europe, 
and North America. Further, it has been recently announced that commuters and 
bus passengers across England will see more eco-friendly buses on the roads, 
congestion reduced, and services upgraded, thanks to a new &pound;101 million 
package of improvements approved by Local Transport Minister Norman Baker. Five 
bus manufacturers, including Optare, are expected to benefit from orders for 
their eco-friendly hybrid, electric and gas buses.</p> 
<p>Enova also maintains a visible presence in the forefront of a growing 
industry with ongoing appearances and speaking engagements by company 
executives at leading industry events such as Ardour Capital&rsquo;s 9th Annual 
Energy Technology Conference in September 2011, the recentNTEA Work Truck show 
in Indianapolis, the upcomingEVS 26 conference at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center and key US Military/Government conferences.</p> 
<p>Throughout 2011, we finalized the development of our next generation Omni 
power management and drive system component. We are also finalizing design of a 
next generation on-board 10kW charger. Our various electric and hybrid-electric 
drive systems, power management and power conversion systems continue to be 
used in applications including Class 3-6 trucks, transit buses, and heavy 
industrial vehicles. We also are continuing our current research and 
development programs, as well as formulating new programs with the U.S. 
government and other private sector companies for electric and hybrid systems.

<h3>Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Vehicle Continues US West Coast Tour</h3>
<h3>Enova and Freightliner displaying the new GFF vehicle at dealerships and 
conferences along the US west coast</h3> 
<p>February 7, 2012</p> 
<p>TORRANCE, CA February 7th, 2012 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova Systems, Inc. (
NYSE AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of proprietary 
hybrid electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system components for 
the emerging green commercial vehicle market, is pleased to announce that a 
pre-production vehicle resulting from Enova&rsquo;s and Freightliner Custom 
Chassis Corp&rsquo;s (FCCC) recently announced Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; initiative (www.greenforfree.com) will continue to be 
on display at various locations along the US west coast.</p> 
<p>After the success and interest generated with both the public and fleet 
operators during the Green Vehicle Transportation Conference, the Portland 
International Auto Show, and a Ride and Drive event in Washington State, theGFF 
all electric delivery Walk in Van will be on display and available to drive at 
the Golden Gate Truck Center in Oakland, CA on February 7th and 8th, followed 
by an exhibition at Velocity Vehicle Group&rsquo;s Los Angeles Freightliner 
Truck Center in Fontana, CA, from February 13th to Feb 17th. Attendees will 
learn more about the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; initiative and 
ENOVA&rsquo;s next-generation Omni drive system.</p> 
<p>Jonathan Randall, Director, Sales and Marketing, Freightliner Custom 
Chassis, said &ldquo;The commercial vehicle market has relied on government 
funding for alternative-fuel vehicles. The Green for Free program relies on the 
life cycle cost savings of an all electric vehicle versus a typical commercial 
vehicle to cover additional expense associated with purchasing an all electric 
vehicle, making the program attractive to fleets both large and small without 
need of government subsidies. Freightliner Custom Chassis is very pleased to be 
partnering with Enova to promote this program, and we are thus equally pleased 
with the reaction our chassis is receiving at the various shows in which we are 
attending.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Mike Staran, Enova President and CEO, said &ldquo;We are extremely pleased 
with the response this initiative is receiving. Customers are realizing that 
the potential for a value proposition does in fact exist and appear to be eager 
to participate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Featuring an industry-leading intelligent design, the Omni Series is 
designed to deliver increased power, greater efficiencies and economic 
advantages for manufacturers of medium and heavy-duty EV andHEV commercial 
vehicles. The new Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Zero Tailpipe Emissions 
vehicle boasts aGVWR of 14,000 to 19,500 lbs and symbolizes the coming of age 
of full electric state of the art technology. It combines theENOVA OMNI series 
drive train with theFCCC MT45 chassis, and a new Morgan Olson body design of 
greatly improved aerodynamics, a one-piece bonded windshield, an 
automotive-like quiet interior and recyclable composite body panels. The result 
is a reliable, durable and user friendly work tool with a body that is 500 lbs 
lighter than the traditional Walk in Van and helps extend drive cycle range. 
With sustainability in mind, the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; vehicle 
benefits from what is expected to be the lowest possible carbon footprint. 
FCCC&rsquo;s MT 45 chassis is built at their zero waste to landfill plant in 
Gaffney SC.ENOVA and FCCC are currently working together on the selection of 
the Battery supplier for this vehicle which is anticipated to be announced in 
the coming weeks. With the selection of the Battery supplier,ENOVA and FCCC 
will be well-positioned to set the pace in the development of large scale 
commercial full EV vehicles and technological innovation in this sector.</p>

<h3>Enova and Freightliner display Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Vehicle
</h3> 
<h3>Portland International Auto Show expects 150,000 attendees</h3> 
<p>January 26, 2012</p> <br>

<p>TORRANCE, CA January 26, 2012 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE 
AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of proprietary hybrid 
electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system components for the 
emerging green commercial vehicle market is pleased to announce that one of the 
first pre- production vehicles resulting from Enova&rsquo;s and Freightliner 
Custom Chassis Corp&rsquo;s (FCCC) recently announced Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; initiative (www.greenforfree.com) will be on display at 
the Portland International Auto Show January 26-29th.</p>

attendees will have the opportunity to view the latest Green, Alternative Fuel 
and Electric Vehicle Concepts at the Auto Show&rsquo;s Eco Center. In its 
second year as one of the largest Eco Centers in the nation, visitors will be 
able to find out more about the latest technology in vehicle charging, solar 
power and a large range of electric and electric hybrids and alternative fuel 
vehicles.</p>

time to cover the incremental expense for the technology. Fleet vehicles 
targeted with the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program stand out as 
possessing unique characteristics that make them clear beneficiaries of 
electric drive technology. With more than 16.3 million vehicles in operation, 
the nation&rsquo;s fleets possess enough capacity to drive initial ramp-up 
scale in the EVOEM supply chains. This is the first Program that is engineered 
to eliminate the overall incremental costs associated with buying and operating 
an all-electric vehicle, making the Program attractive to fleets that are both 
large and small.</p> 
<p>FCCC and Enova plan to gradually deploy a total of 3,000 alternative-fuel 
vehicles beginning in the second half of 2012 as a result of the Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program.ENOVA and FCCC have defined the Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program as a new sustainable transportation model in 
which both companies are working in partnership with commercial fleets to offer 
a transportation model that provides clean, safe domestic and renewable energy.

<h3>Enova Invited to Participate at Freightliner Sponsored Event</h3> 
<h3>Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Vehicle to be on display at multiple 
events</h3> 
<p>January 9, 2012</p> 
<p>TORRANCE, CA January 9, 2012 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE 
AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of proprietary hybrid 
electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system components for the 
emerging green commercial vehicle market, has been invited to participate at a 
Freightliner sponsored clean tech conference in Salem, Oregon. The conference, 
on January 11, will explore the increasing use of alternative fuels in the 
commercial vehicle market. Sponsored by McCoy Freightliner, the conference will 
look at electrification, natural gas, propane, biodiesel &amp; infrastructure. 
Financing, including grants and tax credits, will also be discussed.<br>
 On 
display will be a vehicle that is the result of Enova and Freightliner Custom 
Chassis Corp (FCCC) recently announced &ldquo;Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent;&rdquo; initiative (www.greenforfree.com). This is the 
1st of many scheduled events, which includes the Portland International Auto 
Show on January 26-29th thatFCCC and Enova have scheduled to showcase this 
initiative.<br>
 Mike Staran, Enova President and CEO said &ldquo;We are 
pleased that our collaboration withFCCC is maturing at a rapid pace and look 
forward to the industry&rsquo;s continued interest in Green for 
Free&acirc;&#132;&cent;.&rdquo;<br>
 The Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; 
program allows fleet executives over the life of a vehicle a cost model for an 
all-electric vehicle to be the same, or better than, a diesel-powered 
commercial vehicle. The savings fleets incur from the reduced maintenance and 
fuel savings of the electric vehicles (EVs) is used over a period of time to 
cover the incremental expense for the technology. This is the first program 
that will eliminate the overall incremental costs associated with buying and 
operating an all-electric vehicle, making the program attractive to fleets that 
are both large and small.<br>
 The Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program 
will utilize theFCCC All-Electric Walk-in Van (WIV) chassis powered by the new 
state of the art Enova Omni drive system. Fleets with set routes in pickup and 
delivery applications are ideal for the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; 
program because they have predictable drive routes and return each night to the 
company depot.FCCC is already well-established in the market and can provide 
immediate volume, which is required to reduce high-cost components, such as 
batteries. Additionally, the project looks to focus on disciplined duty cycles, 
utilizing 80 percent of the battery daily, versus design for extended range.</p>
<p>FCCC and Enova plan to deploy a total of 3,000 alternative-fuel vehicles 
within a two-year time frame beginning no later than the third quarter 2012 as 
a result of the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program.ENOVA and FCCC have 
defined the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program as a new sustainable 
transportation model in which both companies are working in partnership with 
commercial fleets to offer a transportation model that provides clean, safe 
domestic and renewable energy.</p>

<h3>Freightliner Custom Corporation And Enova Systems Inc. Partner To Unveil 
Green For Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; Program</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>November 16, 2011</p> 
<p><strong>Torrance, CA &acirc;&#128;&#147; Nov. 16, 2011</strong> 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC) and Enova 
Systems Inc. (NYSE AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of 
proprietary hybrid-electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system 
components for the emerging green commercial vehicle market, today launched a 
program to make electric vehicles more accessible to fleets.</p> 
<p>The Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program allows fleet executives to 
purchase all-electric vehicles for the cost of a diesel-powered commercial 
vehicle. The savings fleets incur from the reduced maintenance and fuel savings 
of the electric vehicles (EVs) is then used over a period of time to cover the 
incremental expense for the technology.</p> 
<p>The Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program will utilize the FCCC 
All-Electric Walk-in Van (WIV) chassis powered by the Enova drive system. 
Fleets with set routes in pickup and delivery applications are ideal for the 
Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program because they have predictable drive 
routes and return each night to the company depot.FCCC is already 
well-established in the market and can provide immediate volume, which is 
required to reduce high-cost components, such as batteries. Additionally, the 
project looks to focus on disciplined duty cycles, utilizing 80 percent of the 
battery daily, versus design for extended range.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;FCCC and Enova recognize that the Green For Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; 
program is necessary in order to make all-electric vehicles more affordable, 
and therefore more accessible, to fleets,&rdquo; said Bob Harbin,FCCC 
president. &ldquo;We want to help those fleets interested in reducing their 
energy consumption and environmental impact by enabling them to purchase more 
alternative-fuel vehicles at one time because of the reduced upfront 
costs.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The commercial vehicle market has relied on government funding for 
alternative-fuel vehicles with some success. However, this is the first program 
that will eliminate the overall incremental costs associated with buying and 
operating an all-electric vehicle, making the program attractive to fleets that 
are both large and small.</p> 
<p>FCCC and Enova plan to deploy a total of 3,000 alternative-fuel vehicles 
within a two-year time frame beginning no later than the third quarter 2012 as 
a result of the Green for Free&acirc;&#132;&cent; program.</p> 
<p>Enova and FCCC developed an integration method for both new and retrofit 
applications. FCCC&rsquo;s all-electric chassis is built upon theFCCC MT-45 
chassis &acirc;&#128;&#147; known for its durability andGVWR of 14,000 to 
19,500 lbs. &acirc;&#128;&#147; which is capable of handling heavy payloads.FCCC
 maintains a dominant market share in theWIV chassis market, which it expects 
to continue to expand.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This business model has the potential to stimulate tremendous and 
rapid growth, helping achieve economies of scale through cost reduction, 
resulting in an excellent value proposition for the commercial fleet 
operator,&rdquo; said Mike Staran, Enova President andCEO. &ldquo;Enova has 
been delivering proven electric drive systems to a diverse set of domestic and 
international customers and has the distinction of seeing more of its green 
drive systems on the road than any of its competitors. The company continues to 
build on more than 20 years of innovation and traces its roots back to General 
Motors&rsquo; EV1 electric car.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>FCCC was the first chassis manufacturer to bring the hybrid-electric 
vehicle and all-electric vehicle to market.</p>

<h3>Trading Update</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>October 12, 2011</p> 
<p>TORRANCE, CA, October 12, 2011</p> 
<p>Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading 
developer of proprietary hybrid electric and all-electric drive systems and 
drive system components for the emerging green commercial vehicle market, 
announces that revenue for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 is expected to 
be materially below that experienced in the first half of the current calendar 
year. Q3 results are expected to be released in mid November.</p> 
<p>This is due to reduced demand from its two largest customers as a result of 
further economic uncertainty. Despite this development, positive feedback from 
customers continues to indicate to Enova that the market will improve in the 
longer term. In the meantime, Enova is exploring options to reduce the 
necessary levels of customers&rsquo; capital expenditure relating to new 
orders, thereby removing a major purchasing obstacle.</p> 
<p>Enova&rsquo;s business strategy is focused on commercial fleets that have 
predictable drive routes, return to a company depot nightly, and are managed by 
expert logistics personnel. Enova believes it is well positioned with the 
industry&rsquo;s leadingOEMs and continues working on initiatives for market 
penetration.</p> 
<p>In addition to ongoing supply to existing customers, Enova is in advanced 
discussions with a number of parties, both in Asia and the UK, and is hopeful 
that these will lead to additional customer orders in the future.</p>

<h3>Enova Systems Files</h3> 
<h3>Shelf Registration Statement</h3> 
<p>August 23, 2011</p> 
<p>August 24, 2011<br>
TORRANCE, CA August, 2011 &acirc;&#128;&#147; Enova 
Systems, Inc. (NYSE AMEX: ENA and AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading developer of 
proprietary hybrid electric and all-electric drive systems and drive system 
components for the emerging green commercial vehicle market, has filed a shelf 
registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;). When the shelf registration statement is declared 
effective by theSEC, it will allow Enova to periodically sell, in one or more 
offerings, up to $50 million of securities, with the amount that Enova expects 
to be able to offer in the next twelve month period limited to one-third of the 
publicly traded float of Enova&rsquo;s common stock.</p> 
<p>Specific terms and share prices will be determined at the time of each 
offering under a separate prospectus supplement to be filed with theSEC at the 
time of each offering. Enova has not made a decision to make any offering at 
this time.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As outlined in today&rsquo;s SEC filing, Enova intends to use 
proceeds of any offering for general corporate purposes, including potentially 
a ramp up to higher production volumes of our power train systems. Once the 
registration statement becomes effective, it will offer us additional 
flexibility in accessing capital markets over a 3-year period when market 
conditions are favorable,&rdquo; stated Michael E. Staran, President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Enova.</p> 
<p>The shelf registration statement filed by Enova Systems with the SEC has 
not yet become effective. No securities covered by the registration statement 
may be sold prior to its effectiveness, nor may offers to buy those securities 
be accepted before that time, and no securities will be offered unless and 
until Enova determines to proceed with an offering. This press release does not 
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any 
securities covered by the registration statement. Any offer of those securities 
may be made solely by means of the prospectus included in the registration 
statement and the prospectus supplement for any future offering.</p> 
<p>Because the publicly-traded float (as calculated under SEC rules) of 
Enova&rsquo;s shares of approximately $24 million as of July 8, 2011 is less 
than $75 million, unless and until Enova&rsquo;s public float exceeds $75 
million, Enova will be restricted to selling securities registered under the 
shelf registration statement equal to no more than 1/3 of the value of its 
public float in any consecutive twelve month period.</p>

<h3>Low Carbon Comercial Market on Brink of Explosion</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>August 15, 2011</p> <br>

<p>US hybrid and electric vehicle specialist Enova told NewNet it is expecting 
the green transport market for commercial vehicles to explode over the next few 
years.</p> 
<p>The company is making retro-fit modifications for businesses such as UPS 
and Fed Ex, and has formed a partnership with US commercial vehicle giant 
Daimler Freightliner, which lays claim to 90 per cent of the fleet delivery 
market.CEO and president of Enova Mike Staran told NewNet that after 30 years 
working in and researching the market, he believes that business transport is 
the best way to develop the clean transport sector.<br>
 Staran said, 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;Our systems are designed for severe-duty, set drive-cycle, 
larger vehicles. The types of vehicles we go after are ones that have an 
average life of ten to twelve years &acirc;&#128;&#147; that way you can more 
easily get a value proposition. These vehicles have it, but passenger cars 
don&rsquo;t have that life cycle. The other reason that we like this is the 
vehicles are bigger, so it&rsquo;s easier to package the system and weight is 
not as big of an issue in a larger vehicle as it is in a passenger 
vehicle.&rsquo;<br>
 He added, &acirc;&#128;&#152;The most important thing for 
us is that we do not think the market is completely ready for anything with 
random drive-cycles. We think you need to do the UPS&rsquo;s and Fed Ex&rsquo;s 
of the world that have very specific drive-cycles that come back to a depot 
every single night but with very limited infrastructure. That is likely to be 
the entry point for lots of people to come into the market.&rsquo;<br>
 Staran 
said companies running commercial fleets know exactly how many miles their 
vehicles travel each day and know where they are going to be at night. This 
means that a battery pack or hybrid solution can be designed for the specific 
requirements of that fleet.<br>
 With a passenger car the distance travelled 
can vary each day and there is the possibility the vehicle will not be at the 
same location each night, making driving patterns less predictable. Business 
fleets avoid this issue as they come back to the same place at the end of a 
driver&rsquo;s shift and can then be charged. This mitigates the need to rely 
on charging stations, which are currently intermittent at best in most 
countries. Staran believes that progressing the commercial market will 
eventually result in the practices filtering down to the rest of the transport 
sector.<br>
 Staran said, &acirc;&#128;&#152;There are many people out there 
today who are putting battery packs on vehicles with a range of 100 plus miles 
per charge, which is very impressive, and we can do<br>
 it and we do with 
Smith Electric Vehicles. However, batteries remain very expensive commodities. 
By focusing on drive-cycles that are 30 miles or less, there is much more 
opportunity to get a pay-back &acirc;&#128;&#147; to get a volume increase that 
can ultimately lead to reducing battery cost &acirc;&#128;&#147; which will 
then ultimately reduce costs for the longer ranges. That day is coming, but I 
am focused on the next year.&rsquo;<br>
 Clean transport is gaining increasing 
traction in the US and the Department of Energy has made it a priority by 
launching a $175m funding pool for advanced vehicle technologies. It recently 
awarded a $7m grant for four fuel cell developers and awarded $11m to EV 
battery developer Nanosys.</p> 
<h3>Enova Systems Announces Decision to Maintain AIM Status and Appointment of

<h3>Next Generation Vehicle for FCCC All-Electric Walk-In Van Introduced at 
2010 Hybrid Truck Users Forum</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>September 29, 2010</p> <br>
<br>

<p>DEARBORN, Mich. &acirc;&#128;&#147; Sept. 28, 2010 &acirc;&#128;&#147; 
Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC) and Morgan Olson LLC today 
launched the next generation vehicle with new exterior and interior body 
styling for its successful all-electric walk-in van (WIV). The MT-EV WIV boasts 
a lightweight, aerodynamic design for improved efficiency. Conceived and 
developed with a contemporary fresh automotive approach, the vehicle maintains 
the hardworking heritage customers expect while ultimately contributing to the 
bottom line.</p> 
<p>FCCC first introduced its plug-in, all-electric WIV chassis, the only one 
domestically engineered and the first in the industry to be completely all 
electric in North America, earlier this year. Following that launch and 
continuing in its legacy of designing alternative fuel products,FCCC partnered 
with Morgan Olson to develop a ground-breaking body style to provide further 
benefits to the delivery van owner, as well as the driver.</p> 
<p>Introduced at the Hybrid Truck Users Forum (HTUF), the new MT-EV was 
engineered with the fleet owner and driver in mind. Built of lightweight, 
durable composites that are completely recyclable, the interior of the cab 
features an automotive-style interior, maximizing driver comfort and 
productivity.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The partnership to develop the MT-EV WIV new body styling with 
Morgan Olson was a natural progression for the all-electric vehicle,&rdquo; 
said Jonathan Randall, director of sales and marketing forFCCC. &ldquo;The new 
design was engineered to allow for improved aerodynamics without giving up the 
functionality of the vehicle. The MT-EV remains a rugged, productive work tool 
that also maintains maximum cargo capacity.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Reliable, Durable Work Tool</strong></p> 
<p>The MT-EV chassis boasts a GVWR of 14,000 to 19,500 lbs. The durable steel 
straight-rail chassis frame reduces flex and bowing to minimize stress while 
carrying heavy payloads. The quiet operation of the all-electric MT-EV also 
makes for an enjoyable driver experience. The MT-EV has a flat-leaf spring 
front and rear suspension, allowing for a smooth, solid ride that minimizes 
cargo shifts on uneven road surfaces.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;By partnering with Morgan Olson, we have effectively developed the 
MT-EVWIV to meet performance, as well as environmental needs of our delivery 
vehicle customers,&rdquo; Randall said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The vehicle development process with Freightliner Custom Chassis has 
been fantastic,&rdquo; said Steve Miller, vice president of sales and marketing 
for Morgan Olson. &ldquo;Both companies started with a clean sheet of paper and 
very strong ideas about the statement the newWIV should make. In addition to 
building a highly efficient delivery van with a distinctive new look, we have 
designed a vehicle that makes a powerful environmental statement. It allows our 
customers to show their commitment to the environment while maximizing driver 
productivity.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The MT-EV WIV has a one-piece bonded windshield allowing for outstanding 
visibility. Taking into account wind flow over the hood and cab, the headlamps 
and mirrors of the body were designed to be aerodynamic, further improving upon 
the vehicle&rsquo;s efficiency.</p> 
<p>The instrumentation panel within the cab incorporates automotive styling 
and adds additional features that constantly monitor the EV operating system to 
provide the driver information, such as the battery state of charge data. Also, 
the vehicle performance gauge is included to assist the driver in the operation 
of the vehicle.</p> 
<p>The full-feature gauge and informational display includes a larger 
messaging center display area, prognostic information and is completely sealed, 
fully protecting it from dust and water projected from backsplash. The larger 
messaging center display area enables easier reading of fault codes and 
maintenance notifications. Rather than relying on predetermined maintenance 
schedules, the incorporation of prognostic information provides the driver 
critical up-to-the-minute maintenance information, such as the life of the 
engine, transmission, oil and filters. This enables the driver to respond 
accordingly while potentially increasing efficiency.</p> 
<p>The all-electric chassis is specifically designed for the urban delivery 
vehicle market in which it can provide the greatest operating and environmental 
benefit. Additionally, the MT EV chassis provides additional safety to drivers, 
such as a curb-side exit, walk-through cargo area and direct access to the 
cargo area from the driver&rsquo;s station.</p> 
<p>The all-electric chassis also was initiated before stimulus money and 
federal grants were available for alternative-fuel transportation projects.</p> 
<p><strong>Created for Zero Tailpipe Emissions</strong></p> 
<p>The MT-EV all-electric chassis utilizes Enova Systems&rsquo; 120kW 
all-electric drive system technology. Enova Systems, Inc (NYSE: ENA and AIM: ENV
 andENVS) is a leading developer and producer of electric and hybrid-electric 
drive system technologies for commercial vehicleOEMs. Powered by Tesla 
Motors&rsquo; lithium-ion batteries, the chassis is 100 percent electric, 
including itsHVAC system, making it the only fully featured WIV chassis in the 
industry to be completely electrically powered.FCCC is the first company within 
the industry to utilize Tesla batteries for commercial applications.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the continued progress of our work with FCCC
,&rdquo; said EnovaCEO and President Mike Staran. &ldquo;Our partnership 
further demonstrates that the appetite for these products is growing. Enova has 
continued to aggressively pursue new technologies, partnerships and 
opportunities to expand the clean vehicle market. Our strategies are generating 
reliable sales growth, strong market position and continued demand for our 
technology.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The all-electric drive system features battery packs that provide up to a 
100-mile driving range on a single charge, making it ideal for pickup and 
delivery applications. The battery pack will charge from fully depleted to 
fully charged in six to eight hours. In addition, the vehicle charging system 
is incorporated into the overall operating system so no exterior devices are 
required to charge the truck.</p> 
<p>The batteries featured on the electric system also capture and store energy 
during the regenerative braking phase of the vehicle&rsquo;s operation. The 
regenerative braking system reduces friction during braking, resulting in less 
brake wear and extended brake life. The regenerative braking system saves 
energy by recycling and storing it, which can then be reused to propel the 
vehicle instead of losing it to heat, as is the case with traditional brakes.
</p> 
<p><strong>Legacy of Engineering Alternative-Fuel Technologies</strong></p> 
<p>FCCC and its parent company, Daimler Trucks North America LLC (DTNA), 
maintain a legacy of providing innovative technologies that benefit customers 
and the environment. FCCC&rsquo;s commitment to green technologies is in line 
with Daimler AG&rsquo;s global initiative called, &ldquo;Shaping Future 
Transportation.&rdquo; Launched in Stuttgart, Germany, by Daimler in 2007, the 
initiative is focused on reducing category emissions pollutants, carbon dioxide 
and fuel consumption.</p> 
<p>In August 2008, Daimler announced the opening of the Global Hybrid Center 
at Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation in Kawasaki, Japan. The center is 
the worldwide hub for Daimler&rsquo;s hybrid development.</p> 
<p>Along with the all-electric chassis, FCCC has extensive experience 
manufacturing compressed natural gas (CNG) WIV chassis, currently manufactures 
hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) chassis, and will offer full production of the 
hydraulic hybrid vehicle (HHV) chassis in Q1 2011 for the walk-in van market 
segment. These alternative-power vehicles have proven to offer significant fuel 
savings benefits.</p> 
<p>FCCC also designs and manufactures alternative-fuel chassis for the 
commercial bus and motorhome market segments. In 2008,FCCC introduced 
ecoFRED&acirc;&#132;&cent;, the motorhome industry&rsquo;s first 
hybrid-electric chassis, and theFCCC MB-HEV hybrid-electric commercial bus

 Kansas City manufacturing facility. A 
cumulative $32 million grant from the Department<br>
 of Energy 
(&ldquo;DOE&rdquo;) is aimed at bringing down related production costs. Smith 
recently<br>
 submitted an order for 50 drive systems as part of expected total 
volume of more than<br>
 250 drive systems for 2010.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Enova was recently notified by the General Services Administration

 contract in collaboration with 
Freightliner andGSA to supply all-electric step vans to the<br>
 Federal 
government. The all-electric step van lends itself as premier zero emissions<br>
 solution for Federal and commercial fleets in the Cargo Vans category. Enova 
received<br>
 its first order for its Ze solution earlier this year.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Freightliner, in partnership with Enova Systems, continues to advance 
alternative fuel<br>
 technology with the plug in, all-electric walk-in 
chassis. New model year vehicles are<br>

<h3>Positive Charge</h3> 
<h3>Torrance maker of hybrid and electric drivetrains hopes new contracts will 
end string of losses.</h3> 
<p>June 14, 2010</p> <br>

<p>Los Angeles Business Journal<br>
 Monday, June 14, 2010<br>
 By Howard Fine
</p> 
<p>Has Enova Systems finally had a breakthrough?</p> 
<p>The Torrance-based maker of hybrid and electric drivetrains for trucks and 
buses has signed two major contracts in recent months that the company expects 
will provide a major boost to revenues.</p> 
<p>One contract calls for Enova to supply electric trucks to the federal 
government; the other is an agreement to supply electric drivetrains to 
Freightliner in Gaffey, S.C., the nation&rsquo;s largest truck chassis maker, a 
division of Daimler Trucks North AmericaLLC.</p> 
<p>But with the company posting losses for the last several years, will these 
contracts be enough to pull the company out of the red?</p> 
<p>And can a company with a mere $5.6 million in revenue last year continue to 
snag contracts as it goes up against multibillion-dollar companies eager to get 
a piece of the electric vehicle market?</p> 
<p>Enova Chief Executive Mike Staran thinks the answer is yes on both counts. 
He said that when Enova beat out billionaire players like Eaton Corp. of 
Cleveland and German titan Siemens AG for the federal General Services 
Administration contract in February, the industry was forced to take notice of 
the small company.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;These developments have begun to separate us from the pack and make 
us a legitimate company in people&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; Staran said in an 
interview in late May before taking off on a road show to promote Enova&rsquo;s 
products to potential customers.</p> 
<p>But one of the few outside analysts who cover the company isn&rsquo;t as 
optimistic.</p> 
<p>Marco Rodriguez, at Stonegate Securities Inc. in Dallas, said he has seen 
similar announcements before, but they haven&rsquo;t led to major revenue gains 
for the company.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It just seems that announcements like these have been made before 
over the years and the execution has come up short,&rdquo; Rodriguez said.</p> 
<p>He said part of the problem is that Enova&rsquo;s customers 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; manufacturers of electric and hybrid-electric trucks and 
buses &acirc;&#128;&#147; don&rsquo;t sell as many vehicles to truck and bus 
fleet operators as initially forecast. So the deals Enova has announced 
haven&rsquo;t led to as many sales of drivetrains as projected.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This may be why Enova&rsquo;s revenue often comes in lower than 
expectations, as they did this past quarter,&rdquo; he noted.</p> 
<p>The company&rsquo;s revenue in the first quarter were $929,000, up 35 
percent from first quarter 2009, but only about half of what Rodriguez said 
investors had been expecting.</p> 
<p>Half expectations</p> 
<p>The company posted a net loss of $1.7 million for the quarter, which 
Rodriguez said was in line with market expectations.</p> 
<p>But Enova&rsquo;s Staran said the two recent announcements can generate 
more significant revenue and eventually break the trend of losses. The 
company&rsquo;s guidance for 2010 now calls for about $15 million in revenues, 
triple last year&rsquo;s level.</p> 
<p>Staran said the market for electric and hybrid-electric trucks and buses 
has been growing as government regulators have focused more on limiting 
emissions from trucks and buses. In California, for example, strict diesel 
emissions on trucks will start to kick in by 2013.</p> 
<p>Enova delivered its first electric van to the General Services 
Administration in May.</p> 
<p>But because this contract comes up for renewal annually, Enova&rsquo;s 
competitors will be closely watching the company&rsquo;s ability to deliver 
quality drivetrains to the government, one industry observer said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of other very well-capitalized companies out 
there,&rdquo; said John Boesel, chief executive of Calstart, a Pasadena 
non-profit that promotes the growth of electric vehicles and other clean 
technologies for transportation. &ldquo;Enova now has to prove it is quicker 
and more nimble than those companies.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Enova has already proved it&rsquo;s a survivor. The company was founded in 
1976 as U.S. Electricar Inc. and was one of the first companies in the electric 
vehicle market. For much of its existence, the company focused on research and 
development and remained a small niche player, supplying small quantities of 
electric drive systems to vehicle manufacturers. (Many of those have gone out 
of business.)</p> 
<p>In 2000, the company changed its name to Enova and moved into the 
burgeoning hybrid-electric vehicle market. It became one of a few manufacturers 
to make both electric and gas-electric drivetrains.</p> 
<p>In the past three years, the company has signed contracts with Navistar 
International Corp., one of the world&rsquo;s largest truck and bus 
manufacturers in Warrensville, Ill.; First Auto Works, one of China&rsquo;s 
largest vehicle manufacturers; and Smith Electric Vehicles, a long-established 
British company that recently entered the U.S. market.</p> 
<p>Yet even with all these contracts in hand, volumes remain small. Electric 
and hybrid-electric trucks and buses have until very recently been a small 
market, populated mostly by &ldquo;early adopters.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s been another problem, too, especially with all-electric 
drivetrains: limited battery life.</p> 
<p>A typical fleet bus or truck lasts 10 to 12 years. But the batteries that 
power the electric drivetrain only have warranties that last three years, and 
they cost thousands of dollars to replace. So truck companies and fleet 
operators are reluctant to switch to electric drivetrains.</p> 
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Deal-killer&rsquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times we&rsquo;ve talked with 
potential end-use customers and they ask, &acirc;&#128;&#152;You mean, if we 
buy an electric truck, we will have to replace the batteries three or four 
times?&rsquo;&rdquo; Staran said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often a deal-killer.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>That means Enova&rsquo;s end-users tend to be those truck and bus 
companies, and fleet operators that choose to be early adopters of electric 
vehicle technology and as such are willing to take the risk of frequent battery 
replacement.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to grow into a $100 million company until 
there are batteries available with warranties of at least seven years,&rdquo; 
Staran said.</p> 
<p>Instead, Enova has been preparing to enter the engine retrofit market, 
specifically to help cash-strapped truck and fleet owners meet looming 
environmental deadlines.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This is a very promising area because it&rsquo;s usually cheaper to 
replace a drive system than it is to replace an entire vehicle,&rdquo; 
Calstart&rsquo;s Bousel said.</p> 
<p>Staran said the company expects its first retrofit contracts during the 
second half of this year.</p> 
<p>But analyst Rodriguez said that for Enova to really capitalize on this 
market, it will have to scale up production.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The company would need more capital to produce on a massive enough 
scale to really take advantage of the retrofit market,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<h3>Enova Announces Hybrid School Bus Order; Initial Large Scale Deployment of 
Federal Stimulus Dollars for School Busses</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>May 26, 2010</p> 
<p>Torrance, CA &ndash; May 26, 2010 &ndash; Enova Systems, Inc (NYSE AMEX: ENA
 andAIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading innovator of propriety hybrid and electric 
drive systems, confirmed today that they, along with Navistar International 
Corporation (NYSE: NAV) and its subsidiary IC Bus, will deploy 16 hybrid school 
buses used for a number of school districts. This deployment represents the 
initial large scale utilization of US Department of Energy grants for clean 
school buses. Both Navistar, who claims 61% of the school bus market in North 
America, and Enova, believe that this initial deployment is a critical next 
step in the evolution of the hybrid school bus program towards long term 
production volume.</p> 
<p>Enova COO John Mullins said, &ldquo;The deployment of these initial systems 
is an affirmation of Navistar&rsquo;s commitment to the hybrid school bus 
market. Enova supports this commitment by engineering a post-transmission 
hybrid drive system that integrates easily and non-invasively&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Enova anticipates an increase in demand for hybrid school buses powered by 
Enova&rsquo;s drive system technologies. Several states and school districts 
have expressed interest in expanding their hybrid school bus fleets. This 
interest should continue to grow as more tax credits and incentives become 
available to ease the transition to hybrid school buses.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This is not the first time Enova has partnered with Navistar to 
break new ground in clean vehicle technology,&rdquo; said EnovaCEO and 
President Mike Staran. &ldquo;In 2005, we collaborated on the industry&rsquo;s 
first production plug-in hybrid vehicle, and we&rsquo;ve refined the technology 
since. This order for 16 Enova-powered hybrid school buses solidifies both our 
companies&rsquo; positions as industry leaders.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Over the past years, Navistar&rsquo;s plug-in hybrid school buses powered 
by Enova&rsquo;s ultra-efficient drive system, have demonstrated a significant 
improvement in fuel economy and reduction in emissions. The partners expect 
these efficiencies to drive further demand for Navistar&rsquo;s hybrid school 
buses.</p>

<h3></h3> 
<p>May 11, 2010</p> <br>

<p>Torrance, CA, May 11, 2010 &acirc;&#128;&#148; Enova Systems, Inc (NYSE: ENA
 andAIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading innovator of proprietary hybrid and electric 
drive systems propelling the clean vehicle industry, unveils its highly 
anticipated next-generation of power electronics with the new Omni-series 
200kVA-capable power inverter for hybrid-electric and all-electric medium and 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles. In addition, Enova is preparing to fulfill the 
first U.S. Government order of its groundbreaking all-electric walk-in step van.
</p> 
<p>In development since February 2009, Enova&rsquo;s industry-leading 
Omni-series inverter features a 50% smaller design package and double the 
continuous power of the current 90kW system. The new inverter&rsquo;s smaller 
size and higher power translate into a significantly improved value proposition 
for customers.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Extensive design validation testing is scheduled for completion in 
Q3 this year, so the Omni will be available for customer program development 
soon after that. With its improved efficiencies, this innovative new technology 
has the potential for faster, wider deployment in the commercial truck and bus 
fleet market around the world,&rdquo; said EnovaCOO John Mullins.</p> 
<p>Power-source agnostic, the new Omni-series inverter also offers increased 
flexibility and ease-of-integration. With plug-and-play connectivity, it is 
compatible with a wide range of vehicle drive systems and motors, and can be 
configured forHEV, PHEV and EV applications. A long list of advanced features

with peak over 200kVA making the Omni capable of powering the Enova P90, P120, 
and even P240 drive systems<br>
 &acirc;&#128;&cent; Heavy duty cast aluminum 
chassis and robust design using minimal harnesses and interconnects allows 
flexible vehicle mounting in any orientation</p> 
<p>The groundbreaking new Omni-series power inverter is the result of 
Enova&rsquo;s ongoing refinement and innovation of its clean vehicle technology 
and a sign of things to come.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Our next-generation Omni-series products firmly establishes Enova as 
the leader in designing and supplying core power electronics components that 
drive clean commercial vehicles,&rdquo; addedCOO Mullins. &ldquo;We will 
continue to innovate and enhance our technology to deliver economic value and 
payback for ourOEM partners and their fleet customers.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>On the heels of the Omni product introduction, Enova received its first 
order through the General Services Administration (GSA). This first deployment 
of EV step vans is part of Enova&rsquo;s exclusive one-year renewable supplier 
contact with theGSA, which supplies vehicles for government agencies and armed 
forces. TheGSA, along with all Federal agencies, has been tasked by President 
Barack Obama in a recent Executive Order to set and meet specific targets for 
increased energy efficiency, a 30% reduction in fleet petroleum consumption, 
and reduced emissions by 2020.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Enova is pleased to have been selected by GSA as the agency&rsquo;s 
exclusive supplier of all-electric steps vans,&rdquo; says Mullins. &ldquo;Our 
all-electric walk-in step van is road-tested and ready to move our government 
and nation forward toward cleaner transportation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The first order of Enova powered vans will be delivered to the U.S. Army 
base located at Ft. Lewis, WA. Built to base specifications with a 157-inch 
wheel base chassis and a 14,500 lb. gross vehicle weight rating, the 
all-electric van is the ideal choice for the unit&rsquo;s Public Works 
department which provides general maintenance across the base.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The initial U.S. Army order allows us to demonstrate the 
efficiencies and robust performance of the van under demanding real-world drive 
cycles,&rdquo; added Mullins. &ldquo;We anticipate increased orders from other 
government agencies and departments in the weeks to come.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation's All-Electric Walk-In Van Chassis 
Debuts at NTEA Work Truck Show</h3> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>March 10, 2010</p> 
<p>GAFFNEY, S.C. &ndash; March 10, 2010 &ndash; Freightliner Custom Chassis 
Corporation (FCCC) continues its legacy of engineering alternative-power 
products for the commercial vehicle industry with the introduction of its 
highly anticipated plug-in all-electric walk-in van (WIV) chassis. The new 
chassis model is the only one domestically engineered and the first in the 
industry to be completely all-electric (includesHVAC system) in North America.
</p> 
<p>The all-electric chassis, developed in partnership with Enova Systems (NYSE
:ENA andAIM:ENV and ENVS), a leading developer and producer of electric and 
hybrid-electric drive system technologies for commercial vehicleOEMs, is built 
on the popularFCCC MT-45 WIV chassis platform.</p> 
<p>FCCC presented the preproduction all-electric WIV chassis model at the 2010 
National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA) Work Truck Show (Booth #3035).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In partnership with Enova we have developed an all-electric chassis 
to meet the environmental, economic and performance needs of our commercial 
vehicle customers,&rdquo; said Bob Harbin,FCCC president. &ldquo;Our vision is 
clearly focused on transitioning the all-electric chassis into the mainstream 
of our walk-in van production programs. This new program demonstrates thatFCCC 
remains fully committed to engineering chassis options that lower operating 
costs and decrease carbon footprints for our customers&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Unlike competitive models, our all-electric chassis is custom-built 
from the ground up for the walk-in van market, integrating the proven ergonomic 
advantages ofWIV bodies,&rdquo; Harbin added. &ldquo;Competitor chassis are a 
cab chassis configuration and end up as box trucks typically built for the 
trucking industry. Competitor products do not offer the ergonomic benefits and 
safety features of aWIV such as curb-side exit, walk-through cargo area, direct 
access to cargo area from driver&rsquo;s station, etc.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Addressing the discussion in the industry surrounding recent federal 
funding for all-electric technology, Jonathan Randall, sales and marketing 
director atFCCC added, &ldquo;FCCC initiated our all-electric project well 
before stimulus money and federal grants were available for alternative-power 
transportation projects.FCCC viewed the all-electric project as the logical 
next step in its alternative-power product offerings, as well as a strategic 
opportunity to continue its leadership role in theWIV industry.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Zero Emissions Without Sacrificing Performance</strong></p> 
<p>The new all-electric chassis enables fleet operators to eliminate harmful 
emissions and cut operating and maintenance costs while delivering the 
performance and driver comfort featuresFCCC customers have come to expect. On 
select delivery and service routes, studies show that customers will save up to 
$15,000 per vehicle annually compared with traditionally powered walk-in vans. 
The quiet operation of the all-electric chassis also makes for an enjoyable 
driver experience. This new chassis has a flat-leaf spring front and rear 
suspension, allowing for a smooth, solid ride that minimizes cargo shifts on 
uneven road surfaces.</p> 
<p>The development program with Enova involved the engineering and integration 
of Enova&rsquo;s 120kW all-electric drive system technology into the new MT-45 
chassis. Ideal for the pickup and delivery market, the MT-45 chassis boasts a
GVWR of 14,000 to 19,500 lbs. The durable steel straight-rail chassis frame 
reduces flex and bowing to minimize chassis stress while carrying heavy 
payloads. &ldquo;Collaborating with Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation has 
enabled us to achieve our shared goal of introducing all-electric drive 
technology into the walk-in van market,&rdquo; said Mike Staran, president and
CEO of Enova Systems. &ldquo;The FCCC-Enova partnership is accelerating the 
broad deployment of EV technology in this critical vehicle segment while 
improving the environment and helping to reduce U.S. dependence on imported 
energy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Powered by Tesla Motors lithium ion batteries, the chassis is 100 percent 
electric, including itsHVAC system, making it the only fully featured WIV 
chassis in the industry to be completely electrically powered.FCCC is the first 
company within the industry to utilize Tesla batteries for commercial 
applications.</p> 
<p>The all-electric drive system features battery packs that provides an up to 
100-mile driving range on a single charge, making it ideal for pickup and 
delivery applications. The battery pack will charge from fully depleted to 
fully charged in six to eight hours.</p> 
<p>The batteries featured on the electric system also capture and store energy 
during the regenerative braking phase of the vehicle&rsquo;s operation. The 
regenerative braking system reduces friction during braking, resulting in less 
brake wear and extended brake life. The regenerative braking system saves 
energy by recycling and storing it, which can then be reused to propel the 
vehicle instead of losing it to heat, as is the case with traditional brakes.
</p> 
<p>Other features include a parking pawl within the gear box and a push-button

Vehicles&rsquo; Newton Van</p> 
<p>Torrance, CA, February 1, 2010 &ndash; Enova Systems, Inc. (NYSE: ENA and 
AIM: ENV and ENVS), a leading innovator of proprietary hybrid and electric 
drive systems propelling the alternative energy industry, today announces the 
company has been awarded an exclusive supplier contract with the General 
Services Administration (GSA), which provides vehicles for government agencies 
and armed forces. The Enova Ze is powered by Enova&rsquo;s 120kW all-electric 
drive system and is currently the only zero emissions solution for federal 
fleets in the step van category.</p> 
<p>As part of the contract, Enova will supply Enova Ze all-electric walk-in 
step vans toGSA with a GVWR between 10,001 and 16,000 lbs. for 12, 14, and 16 
foot body lengths.GSA, along with all Federal agencies, has been tasked by 
President Barack Obama in a recent Executive Order to set and meet specific 
targets for increased energy efficiency, a 30% reduction in fleet petroleum 
consumption, and reduced emissions by 2020.</p> 
<p>The Enova Ze&rsquo;s zero emissions technology has captured the attention 
of some of the largest commercialOEMs and fleet operators in the world. 
Recently, Enova has partnered with Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC
), to integrate and deploy this innovative technology with the MT-45 walk-in 
van chassis, with deployment to national fleet operator(s) in the first quarter 
of 2010.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Enova is honored to have been selected by GSA as the agency&rsquo;s 
exclusive supplier of all-electric step vans,&rdquo; says Enova President andCEO
 Michael Staran. &ldquo;We are pleased that our technology has been recognized 
by the federal government and we are fully prepared to supportGSA&rsquo;s 
efforts to meet their targets as mandated by President Obama.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Enova Ze is a perfect fit for U.S. government agency fleets that 
are looking to meet emissions targets. We continue to pave the way towards zero 
emissions commercial transportation and solidifying our position as a 
technology leader in this nascent government market,&rdquo; says John Mullins, 
Enova&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer. &ldquo;We encourage all government 
procurement officers to consider the road to reduced emissions with the Enova 
Ze.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The U.S. Air Force has been evaluating the Ze all-electric drive system for 
more than 18 months, with positive results. Tom Quinn, the Director for the 
Hawaii Center for Advanced Transportation Technology (HCATT) says, &ldquo;The 
Enova Ze has performed exceptionally well for the U.S. Air Force. The support 
staff at Hickam Air Force Base have relied on the Ze to deliver outstanding 
service and quiet performance every day. It certainly has become a valuable 
addition to their fleet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Advantages of the Ze drive system technology include:</p> 
<p>- Ease of use, with none of the maintenance requirements associated with 
gasoline drive trains.</p> 
<p>- 6 &ndash; 8 hour battery charge, achieved via a simple 220 volt outlet.
</p> 
<p>- Combined Electronic Drive Motor (EDM), Enova Control Electronics Unit (CEU
), and batteries eliminate the need for an internal combustion engine.</p> 
<p>- Ideal application for vehicles with a regular driving route that involves 
stop-and-go driving conditions.</p> 
<p>- Zero greenhouse gas emissions, making it an ideal candidate for 
government and commercial fleets looking to reduce their carbon footprints.</p> 
<p>In related news, Enova lauded Smith Electric Vehicles&rsquo; 
(&ldquo;Smith&rdquo;) recentGSA announcement of the Smith Newton product 
offering in the Medium and Heavy Duty Vans category with aGVWR of 25,500 lbs.
