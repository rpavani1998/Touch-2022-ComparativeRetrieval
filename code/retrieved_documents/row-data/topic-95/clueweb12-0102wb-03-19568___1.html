<h2>Investing in Hybrid Vehicles to Curb Carbon Emissions</h2> 
<p>Our customers would be pleased to know that we&rsquo;re investing in 
vehicles that are more environmentally friendly, such as hybrid bucket trucks, 
to curb greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s important to lead by example. Our customers 
place great value on the environment, and so do we,&rdquo; said Ken Parker, 
President, Atlantic City Electric.</p> 
<p> Atlantic City Electric also plans to convert all of its truck fueling 
facilities to emission-reducing biodiesel fuel, which is a blend of 20 percent 
soybean oil and 80 percent low-sulfur diesel.</p> 
<p> Company vehicles will be transformed over time as vehicles come up for 
replacement, initially replacing them with available hybrid and 
alternative-fuel vehicles, and later with even newer technology as it becomes 
commercially available.</p> 
<p> Existing hybrids use both an electric motor and a standard gasoline or 
diesel engine.</p> 
<p> While the cost of hybrid vehicles is greater than that of conventional 
vehicles, Atlantic City Electric knows there is great value for the environment 
by helping reduce carbon monoxide pollution.</p> <br>
