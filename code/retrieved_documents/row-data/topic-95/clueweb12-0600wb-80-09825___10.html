<h3>Two world debuts from Peugeot: 508 RXH, the distinctive-looking 
diesel-electric hybrid and the multi-purpose HX1 Concept Car<br>
</h3> <br>
<br>
Peugeot 508 RXH <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>For Peugeot, the product offensive launched in 2010 continues and expands 
in 2011 with two strategic means of leverage: internationalisation and an 
enhanced brand positioning.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To illustrate this dynamic approach, Peugeot:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- is deploying its diesel-electric hybrid technology on the 508 RXH 
following its release on the 3008 HYbrid4,<br>
 - is unveiling the HX1, a 
marriage of radical styling and environmental excellence,<br>
 - is exhibiting 
its Premium platform models: 508, 3008 HYbrid4, RCZ,<br>
 - is reaffirming its 
position as automotive environmental leader,<br>
 - is presenting its vision of 
the new world order in the automotive sector.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>508 RXH: DIESEL-ELECTRIC HYBRID AND DISTINCTIVE APPEAL </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peugeot unveils the 508 RXH, its completely individual third model in the 
508 range.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>An expression of Peugeot&rsquo;s enhanced appeal with its upmarket 
trend</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When it is released in spring 2012, a year after the launch of the 508, the 
508 RXH is to be considered as a completely separate model. It is an 
incarnation of a modern and different upmarket range from Peugeot, both in its 
dimensions and its visual identity, through the choice of a unique hybrid 
high-tech diesel engine and electric motor with a single, lavishly-appointed 
trim level.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Its visual signature is enhanced by its individual front end character, 
flared wings, daytime running lights signature and a new exclusive body colour.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The same special care has played an integral role in the direction taken 
with the distinctive design of the 508 RXH interior, harmonising specific 
colours and natural materials.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With its wider track, its 18&rsquo;&rsquo; wheels and raised attitude the 
508 RXH has a natural stance that is inspired by its all-road capability. 
Furthermore, due to its HYbrid4 drive train, it offers a responsible and 
intelligent alternative vision.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>The diesel-electric hybrid; a new level of driving pleasure</strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Illustrating the cross-platform, modular versatility of HYbrid4 technology, 
the 508 RXH is, after the HYbrid4 3008, the second of the marque&rsquo;s models 
to receive the diesel-electric hybrid power plant.</p> 
<p>With a combined output of 200 bhp from its 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine and 
electric motor on the rear axle, the 508 RXH is able to provide for the desires 
for a new driving experience with a choice of four HYbrid4 modes (Automatic, 
&ldquo;Zero Emissions Vehicle&rdquo;, Sport or 4WD) and exceptional fuel 
economy (4.0 l/100 km (70.6 mpg) in the Combined Drive Cycle, and CO2 of 109 
g/km).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peugeot is exhibiting a Limited Edition 508 RXH at Frankfurt: the run of 
300, individually-numbered examples in Calern Brown with Alcantara leather 
upholstery can be pre-reserved online from the opening of the Motor Show.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>HX1: MULTI-PURPOSE CONCEPT CAR </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HX1, making its worldwide d&eacute;but in Frankfurt, is a concept for 
gauging interest which has a specification to seat up to six people in a 
vehicle with unconventional styling: robust, sporty, integrating the new brand 
identity, unparalleled aerodynamics, and providing a unique interior space and 
driving experience.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rising to this challenge, the designers have placed adaptability at the 
heart of their creation: the HX1 can metamorphose to suit its environment, the 
driving conditions and the expectations of its occupants.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, due to its many mobile aerodynamic parts that were designed with speed 
in mind, the HX1&rsquo;s unusual MPV architecture, very low for a length of 
4.93 m, results in an exceptional Cd of 0.28.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Its four reverse-opening doors provide access to the interior of HX1, the 
marque&rsquo;s vision of a high-end passenger compartment, which combines 
elegance and modernity, natural materials and ultra-high technological 
specification. It offers its occupants an exceptional level of interior space, 
an innovative modular design with its original &ldquo;4+2&rdquo; configuration, 
and provides the driver with a driving position that can be adapted to suit 
driving conditions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With a combined power output of 299 bhp from the 2.2 litre HDi engine 
driving the front wheels and the electric motor integrated into the rear axle, 
its diesel-electric hybrid drive train provides the functionality of HYbrid4 
technology such as four-wheel drive and the &lsquo;all electric&rsquo; mode 
with an increased potential range of 30 km (18.6 miles) due to the &ldquo;plug 
in&rdquo; function.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HX1 thus obtains an astonishingly low combined fuel consumption of 3.2 
l/100 km (88.2 mpg) with impressive CO2 emissions of 83 g/km.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PEUGEOT: THE UPMARKET TREND</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At its stand in Frankfurt, Peugeot is putting its Premium models under the 
spotlight, a definitive illustration of the marque&rsquo;s upmarket shift.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- After a successful launch in Europe in the first half of 2011 (with 
57,000 sales by the end of June), then its release onto the Chinese market in 
August, the 508 is reaffirming the Marque&rsquo;s ambitions regarding one of 
its historical territories, the large car.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Through its appealing styling, the impressive environmental credentials of 
its extensive range of engines and cutting-edge technology, along with its 
pleasant onboard surroundings and the driving experience it provides, the 508 
(Saloon or SW) offers a modern range at one with the aspirations of its 
dynamic, responsible and discerning customers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Since its highly-anticipated launch in spring 2010, the RCZ sports 
coup&eacute; has exceeded expectations, and has taken pole position among 
sports coup&eacute;s in its class in Europe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Frankfurt, the dynamism of the RCZ is revealed with:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&bull; a limited-edition &ldquo;Asphalt&rdquo; version which is 
distinguished from the standard 200 hp version by its Telluric matt grey 
bodywork, its two-tone 19&rdquo; wheels and many distinctive 
&ldquo;Asphalt&rdquo; features;</p> 
<p>&bull; and a 200 bhp 2.0 l HDi version, which was victorious at the 2011 
&ldquo;24 Hours N&uuml;rburgring&rdquo; in the diesel category, and is the 
current diesel category leader in the German VLN Endurance Championship.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Demand for the 3008 Crossover continues to impress with sales up in the 
first half of 2011 (74,000) which are once again on the increase with a demand 
mainly for the range-topping versions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even before the arrival of the 3008 HYbrid4 on the market, the 3008, and 
the effective way in which the 5008 compact MPV complements it, is enabling 
Peugeot to stake its claim as a key player in the highly-competitive 
&ldquo;midsize&rdquo; market.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PEUGEOT: ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Frankfurt, the 508 RXH, the HX1 concept and the 908 Hybrid4 which 
Peugeot Sport is currently developing, are all demonstrations of 
Peugeot&rsquo;s pioneering and determined approach to diesel-electric 
hybridization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yet Peugeot&rsquo;s environmental commitment is being reflected in practice 
in 2011, through the major advances that the marque is exhibiting in Frankfurt.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Peugeot actively seeks to reduce the CO2 emissions of its vehicle range: 
the average emissions of the marque&rsquo;s models were measured in the first 
half of 2011 at 129.8 g/km CO2 compared to 131.3 in 2010, therefore dropping 
below the 130 g/km limit set for 2015 by the European Commission.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- 3008 HYbrid4 - the first Diesel Hybrid in the world </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By launching the world&rsquo;s first diesel hybrid vehicle in the second 
half of 2011, Peugeot is offering an exclusive range in terms of 
environmentally-friendly functionality and driving pleasure.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the 3008 Crossover, the hybridization of a 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine 
developing 163 bhp driving the front wheels and an electric motor developing 37 
bhp on the rear axle, can reconcile a new driving experience, through 
four-wheel drive, a maximum output of 200 bhp, a &ldquo;Zero Emissions 
Vehicle&rdquo; mode, and an average fuel consumption of 3.8 l/100 km (74.3 mpg) 
with 99 g/km CO2), down 35% on an internal combustion engine with a similar 
power output.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- e-HDi, micro-hybrid technology </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the first half of 2011 the 508 and the new 308 launched the e-HDi 
innovative technology, the new generation<em>STOP &amp; START </em>System, 
which reduces fuel consumption by nearly 15% in Urban Drive Cycle, prior to its 
deployment in the second half of the year on the 3008, the 5008 and PARTNER 
(Van and Tepee).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>e-HDi combines the 1.6 l HDi Euro 5 engine and a reversible-alternator 
which provides the<em>STOP &amp; START </em>System function, supplemented by a 
braking energy recovery system and hybrid battery that delivers additional 
power at start-up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Electric: 2- or 4-wheel drive&hellip;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&bull; iOn is a latest-generation all-electric city car, designed for 
business customers and private individuals. The lithium-ion batteries powering 
the 64 hp electric motor permit a top speed of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a range of 
150 km (93 miles). The distinguished recipient of several awards in Europe, iOn 
has received over 2,000 orders at the end of June 2011.</p> 
<p>&bull; At the Peugeot stand in Frankfurt, the e-Vivacity scooter is another 
illustration of the Marque&rsquo;s response to new expectations in terms of 
&ldquo;zero emissions&rdquo; urban mobility. All-electric, practical and 
modern, intuitive and nippy; the e-Vivacity offers a range of 60 km (37 miles) 
and an average energy cost of &euro;0.4/100 km, thanks to its next generation 
compact lithium-ion batteries.</p> 
<p>&bull; But for Peugeot, &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; can also mean 
&ldquo;intensity&rdquo;. This is how the EX1 concept was born.With two electric 
motors that give a combined output of 340 hp, four-wheel drive and an extremely 
aerodynamic and lightweight structure, EX1 is an out-of-the-ordinary two-seater 
roadster, designed for an intense driving experience.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The EX1 has already set or broken several validated records for 
acceleration in France, Germany and China.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>THE AUTOMOTIVE NEW WORLD ORDER: PEUGEOT IS ONE STEP AHEAD</strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In response to and anticipation of emerging mobility requirements, Peugeot 
is introducing a new vision, with concrete responses to the challenges of the 
automotive new world order.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- <em>Mu by Peugeot </em>is a &ldquo;new generation&rdquo; rental scheme 
which offers customers, whether they own a vehicle or not, a rental vehicle 
from the Peugeot ranges for a period of their choice: private vehicle, 
commercial vehicle, scooter, bicycle and accessories.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Due to the variety of its range, now enhanced by electric vehicles, its 
ease of use and its contained tariffs,<em>Mu by Peugeot </em>already has more 
than 8,000 customers in eight European countries.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Marque forecasts the deployment of 75 new Mu sites per year, with an 
objective of 300 sites across Europe by 2013.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- At Frankfurt, Peugeot is presenting its pan-European online services. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peugeot Connect has three features: <em>Peugeot Connect SOS </em>emergency 
callout,<em>Peugeot Connect Assistance </em>breakdown assistance and <em>
Peugeot Connect Fleet</em>for fleet management services. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Available as an option or as standard on almost all range models, Peugeot 
Connect strengthens Peugeot&rsquo;s leading position in matters of tertiary 
safety.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Already a leader in tertiary safety, Peugeot&rsquo;s objective for 2011 is 
to exceed 600,000 vehicles equipped with the emergency call equipment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Peugeot Scooters, the longest&ndash;standing manufacturer of motorised 
two-wheelers in the world and fourth European marque in 2010, is following an 
ambitious development plan and now includes 22 models between 50 and 500 cc. In 
2011, Peugeot Scooters is launching the electric e-Vivacity and the 125 cc 
CityStar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- For Peugeot, the bicycle represents a history of 120 years of passion. 
The new Peugeot Cycles range, boasting more than 50 models, is tailored to 
wide-ranging requirements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An exclusive interpretation from the Peugeot Design Centre, the Design Lab 
DL-121 exhibited at Frankfurt is a limited production run concept bike which, 
with its coppered finish, brings a new dimension to the world of cycling. The 
e-bike AE-11 in the Allure range, brings ride enjoyment with its innovative 
soft feel and very reliable Panasonic Li-ion manganese12 Ah battery.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>2011 FOCUSING ON ACCELERATION</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the first half of 2011, this dynamic approach has enabled Peugeot to:</p>
<p><br>
 - record 1,091,000 sales worldwide and to accelerate its 
internationalisation,</p> 
<p><br>
 - launch the 508 successfully in Europe, then in China,</p> 
<p><br>
 - update its range at the heart of the market through the very 
favourable reception given to the new 308,</p> 
<p><br>
 - reduce the overall carbon footprint of its product range further,
</p> 
<p><br>
 - accelerate the deployment of the highly-innovative and unique <em>
Mu by Peugeot</em>mobility scheme.</p>
