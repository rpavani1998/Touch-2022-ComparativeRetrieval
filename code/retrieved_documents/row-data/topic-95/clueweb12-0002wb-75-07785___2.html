<p> &laquo; Serious Cash Back on Hybrids | Main | Diesel v. CLEAR ACT Action 
&raquo; </p> 
<h3>Diesel v. Hybrid incentives duke it out in D.C.</h3> 
<p>Hi everyone, Don Anair CA vehicles analyst with my first hybridblog.&nbsp; 
Not to be confused with my DC colleague Don MacKenzie, who posted the first 
hybridblog and absconded with the screen name &quot;Don,&quot; I'm going to use 
the monicker &quot;Sharkey&quot; from here on in.</p> 
<p>Now, the House eliminated credits for hybrid vehicles in the energy bill, 
but supports credits for diesel vehicles in the Energy Bill they just 
passed&hellip; and now, even thepresident backs polluting consumer incentives 
by giving taxpayer dollars to diesel vehicles, taking us a step backwards on 
childhood asthma and lung disease in our elderly.</p> 
<p>The Diesel Technology Forum (DTF), an industry trade group, was delighted 
to hear the president&rsquo;s support for diesel vehicles on Wednesday.&nbsp; 
On Thursday, DTF even had a&rdquo;ride and drive&rdquo; event on Capitol Hill 
touting their &ldquo;clean, quite, and fun&rdquo; to drive diesel 
vehicles.&nbsp; Clean? Diesel vehicles have certainly become cleaner over the 
years because of stronger emission standards, but they are still far from the 
cleanest vehicles on the road today.&nbsp; For example, take the diesel VW 
Jetta.&nbsp; This vehicle emits about 44 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide 
emissions and between 4 and 8 times more toxic diesel particulate emissions 
(that's soot, folks) than a comparable Toyota Corolla . I don&rsquo;t know 
about you, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call that clean.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
True, 
I&rsquo;m making a comparison of today&rsquo;s vehicles and not accounting for 
the fact that diesel vehicles will have to meet the same set of emission 
standards as gasoline cars by 2009.&nbsp; But the structure of these standards 
will allow some vehicles to emit a lot more pollution than the average.&nbsp; 
Many of today&rsquo;s conventional vehicles are several times cleaner than the 
average vehicle under new tailpipe standards.&nbsp; Not so with diesels.&nbsp; 
Diesels have a ways to go to even meet the<em>average standard</em>, never mind 
getting cleaner than average.&nbsp; If diesel vehicles are unable to meet 
progressively tighter emission standards, future progress in protecting public 
health may stall. In fact, the energy bill in the House could make this 
prospect a reality by encouraging the sale of diesels that emit as much as 10 
times more smog forming pollutants than some of the hybrids already on the road.
<br><br>
So what about fuel economy benefits of diesel vehicles?&nbsp; Glad you 
asked.</p> 
<p>Widespread introduction of diesel cars and trucks is sometimes heralded as 
the solution to reducing petroleum consumption in the U.S.&nbsp; In fact, this 
promise is often overstated. As our report,The Diesel Dilemma, shows while 
diesels may have a role to play, a diesel-only approach to petroleum reduction 
could result in greater costs to consumers than utilizing more efficient 
gasoline vehicles for achieving equivalent petroleum reductions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Diesel vehicles might go 30 to 40 percent farther on a gallon of diesel, 
but that&rsquo;s not the whole story.&nbsp; Diesel fuel actually contains more 
energy per gallon than gasoline and producing each gallon of diesel requires 
10- 25 percent more petroleum and results in 12-18 percent more heat-trapping 
gas emission than a gallon of gasoline&mdash;this takes a big chunk out of 
diesel&rsquo;s commonly quoted benefits.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the VW Jetta/Toyota Corolla comparison again.&nbsp; 
Even though the diesel Jetta receives better fuel economy numbers than the 
Corolla, they emit the same amount of heat-trapping CO2 emissions.&nbsp; And to 
top it off, the Corolla does 0 to 60 in less than 10 seconds, a couple seconds 
faster than the VW&rsquo;s 11.6 seconds. Go figure.</p> 
<p>Add in the high up-front cost of diesel engines and emission controls and 
diesel vehicles could become a more costly approach to petroleum reduction than 
improved gasoline vehicles.&nbsp; And remember, hybrid technology does 
something that diesel engines alone will never do - serve as a technological 
stepping-stone to fuel cell vehicles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>If performance based incentives are going to include diesel engines, they 
must also provide the same benefits to other conventional vehicle technologies 
and must require that the vehicles meet or beat the tailpipe emissions 
standards for the average new car.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Providing incentives to ONLY diesel vehicles, especially without adequate 
performance criteria for tailpipe pollutants, is a misguided approach and 
forces an unnecessary tradeoff between fuel economy and smog or toxic tailpipe 
emissions.&nbsp; Those problems are especially glaring in contrast to the CLEAR 
ACT approach David talked about in the last post.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3> <br>

<p>I'm quite disturbed by the high level of anti-diesel discussion on this and 
its sister site. This shouldn't become an either/or debate between hybrid and 
diesel advocates. If we're going to be successful in reducing overall 
consumption and finding long term solutions, we have to work together. The 
common enemy are the gas guzzling SUVs and other low-efficiency vehicles.</p> 
<p>Diesels may produce more smog, but they can also run on biodiesel. Hybrids 
are much cleaner but run on gasoline. Neither is perfect. Both have their 
place. Let's stop this destructive in-fighting and focus on the the real 
problems.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Ted Inoue | May 04, 2005 at 07:55 PM </p> <br>

<p>Ted - just another visitor here, but I think this is another case where the 
devil is in the details. If the government was really going to support the 
small, efficient, and increasingly clean diesels they have in Europe that might 
be good - especially if moves to clean up those diesels pay off.</p> 
<p>Of course, this is our government, our president, our congress ... which 
makes me think they are using this &quot;and diesel&quot; clause to pay off 
Detroit and subsidize those huge 4x4 diesel king-cab trucks I see being used as 
&quot;communter cars&quot; down here in Orange County, CA.</p> 
<p>Oh, I suppose the old Hummer H1 model (in diesel) might qualify as well.</p>
<p>Am I wrong? I'd love to be too cycnical, for once!</p> <br>

<p>Hi Guys, ScottN here. Just wanted to quickly join in this conversation with 
a bit of friendly pushback for Ted. You make a good point about 
&quot;either/or&quot; and the potential of diesel, but let me make a few points:
</p> 
<p>1) The &quot;either/or&quot; choice was made by the House, which eliminated 
all non-diesel incentives in the Energy Bill, and made those incentives such 
that it does not push toward truly cleaner diesel. As Odograph said, the devil 
is in the detials, and that's a pretty darned important one.</p> 
<p>2) If you take a look at our report, the Diesel Dilemma (if you didn't 
click on the link in Sharkey's blog, it's
http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/cars_and_suvs/page.cfm?pageID=1307), 
you'll see we are not anti-diesel, but there are questions about it's 
cost-effectiveness on gas/oil savings and pollution as opposed to advanced 
gasoline technology. Truly clean diesel can certainly be in the clean car 
future mix, but we have to have a realistic baseline about what it can do and 
what the cost will be to the consumer to get there.</p> 
<p>3) Much like diesel technology, biodiesel has potential, but still has cost 
and compatibility issues, not to mention the fact that some are trying to pass 
2% biodiesel (B2) mixed with regular diesel as a &quot;green solution&quot; 
where it really is not, and there is the factor of a 10% increase in Nitrogen 
Oxide emissions for 100% biodiesel (though you're talking about major 
reductions in carbon and soot). We have a FAQ on biodiesel that does a pretty 
nice job surveying the landscape, you can find it at
http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/trucks_and_buses/page.cfm?pageID=1415.</p> 
<p>Hope helps clarify this a bit.</p> <br>

<p>The UCS members certainly have a right to their opinions about light-duty 
diesel vehicles (apparently always with the connotation &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;). 
However, the full disclosure about the air quality impacts of light-duty 
gasoline and diesel vehicles needs to be made, not just one-sided half-truths.
</p> 
<p>First of all, the statement that the VW Jetta TDI makes &ldquo;&hellip;44 
times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions&hellip;&rdquo; actually should 
read &ldquo;&hellip;44 times more smog-DEPLETING nitrogen oxide 
emissions&hellip;&rdquo; since nitrogen oxide (NO) actually destroys 
ground-level ozone (GLO). It&rsquo;s NO2 that is the &ldquo;ozone 
precursor&rdquo; in that it photodissociates into NO + atomic oxygen (O) which 
subsequently is available to combine with molecular oxygen (O2) to make ozone. 
Virtually all of the NOx emitted by diesel engines is in the form of nitrogen 
oxide (NO).</p> 
<p>Also what is not mentioned is that gasoline vehicles typically give off 
relatively large quantities of fugitive VOCs which diesel vehicles do NOT 
(diesel fuel is virtually non-volatile at ambient conditions). In my opinion as 
an air quality scientist (yes, I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;concerned scientist&rdquo; 
too, I just don&rsquo;t happen to agree with all of UCS&rsquo;s positions, 
especially on diesel vehicles), anthropogenic VOCs are what are causing GLO 
levels to remain stubbornly high in many urban areas. Additional VOC emissions 
come from the production, distribution, and refueling of gasoline, something 
for which &ldquo;tailpipe&rdquo; emissions do not account.</p> 
<p>While current diesel vehicles typically emit higher levels of particulate 
matter (PM) than an equivalent gasoline vehicle, particulate filters (DPFs) are 
being used in Europe which reduce the PM emissions to BELOW ambient levels, 
i.e., DPF-equipped diesel vehicles are functioning as PM filters as they run 
around. DPF&rsquo;s should be utilized in this country also. Costs are not 
appreciable. Gasoline vehicles would need filters just to keep up!</p> 
<p>Mercury has demonstrated a diesel-hybrid vehicle call the META ONE which is 
categorized as PZEV, according to Mercury. Why isn&rsquo;t UCS CLAMORING for 
vehicles like this? Are you satisfied with gas-hybrids which only get about the 
same mileage as diesel vehicles with a conventional transmission (and 
that&rsquo;s mostly only in stop-and-go city traffic)? Diesel-hybrids are 
capable of 30-40% better mileage than gas-hybrids.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, diesel vehicles are capable of running on biodiesel (B100). 
UCS apparently endorses biodiesel. Use of biodiesel significantly reduced 
emissions from diesel engines in and of itself. As for costs, B20 biodiesel 
where I live is actually less than petro-diesel and even regular grade 
gasoline. However, diesel vehicles are needed to utilize biodiesel.</p> 
<p>UCS&rsquo;s opposition to tax credits for clean diesel is ill-founded and 
ill-conceived in my opinion.<br>
</p> <br>

<p>Rather than creating yet more complex credits to try to create a minor 
encouragement for something good, it would be far, far simpler and more 
effective to do one simple thing:<br>
 create a petroleum fuel tax, to account 
for all of the hidden costs of petroleum dependence, using the revenue to 
decrease income taxes proportionately.</p> 
<p>A petroleum tax would both encourage people to purchase more efficient 
vehicles, and *also* use domestic alternative fuels. Encourage people to buy 
gas-electric and diesel-electric hybrids, and run them on ethanol and biodiesel.
</p> 
<p>In the long run, the ONLY way we can improve our economy (related to energy 
costs) will be to create a petroleum tax. We can't pump nearly enough petro 
here in the US to get us back to importing less than 50% of the oil we use. The 
only way to do that is with alternatives. The problem is that it costs 
countries like Saudi Arabia about $2 per barrel to pump oil (which they now 
sell for $45-55). We can't come close to that $2 per barrel with any 
alternative, now or in the foreseeable future. So, once alternatives start 
making a subtantial dent in our petroleum imports, enough that the oil 
countries are not pumping at full capacity, they can lower prices enough to 
force alternatives back out of the market, and still be making a tidy profit. 
Say we can produce biodiesel for $30 per barrel. Saudi Arabia and other oil 
countries could sell oil for $20 per barrel and still have a huge profit 
margin. Since the majority of consumers buy based solely on price, that will 
just force competitors back out of the market, and put us right back at being 
wholly dependent on petroleum.</p> 
<p>Also, without any form of petroleum tax, just increasing our efficiency 
will result initially in reducing demand, which will drop petroleum prices, 
making it more difficult to get the majority of the public to buy efficient 
vehicles, or use alternatives - so consumption will go back up.</p> 
<p>I think it's important to characterize this not as a &quot;tax 
increase&quot;, but rather shifting a portion of income tax away from that and 
into a petroleum tax (since as I said, income taxes should be reduced 
proportionately with the creation of the petroleum tax, so that people are not 
paying more in total. For example, if we calculate that creating, say, a 50 
cent per gallon petroleum tax would create an additional $90 billion in tax 
revenue (that's roughly what it would create), income tax rates would be 
reduced across the board just enough to reduce income tax revenue by $90 
billion). It wouldn't be done to get additional revenue, but to accomplish two 
things:<br>
 1. Shift the hidden costs of petroleum dependence onto petroleum 
sales itself, rather than using income taxes to pay those hidden costs - 
lowering the cost to consumers, which encourages continuing our dependence.<br>

 2. Level the playing field more for alternative fuels (by having consumers pay 
the true price of petroleum at the pump), or even give them an advantage. The 
problems of continuing our petroleum dependence are so large, and will only get 
worse, that it should be considered an issue of extreme national importance - 
economically and strategically (and environmentally, although that's less of a 
concern to most people) - that it is justifiable to have a &quot;sin tax&quot; 
on petroleum, to encourage more efficient use, and use of alternatives.<br>

<p>I think Mike Briggs and I are on the same page.</p> 
<p>My current thinking is that the combination of three things will yield 
optimum results:</p> 
<p> * tax &ldquo;bad&rdquo; energy, and &ldquo;hogs&rdquo; of bad energy higher
<br> * fund research possible replacements<br>
 * allow a free market in those 
replacements</p> 
<p>That would seem to guarantee that the bad goes away, and the most efficient 
replaces it.</p> 
<p>The problem with the status quo is that the corn lobby fights the hydrogen 
lobby, and the winner will likely be political rather than practical.</p> 
<p>No one is going to do this of course, so it is more a suggested direction 
than a policy.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: odograph | May 05, 2005 at 01:08 PM </p> <br>

<p>Did you guys notice that the &quot;hill drive&quot; page lists some small 
to midsize diesels, but if you click on their link for a complete list of 
diesel vehicles, you see a bunch of big trucks?</p> 
<p>I'm afraid the diesel advocates are going to be used to get subsidies to GM 
for their Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD Duramax Turbo Diesel 6600 V8</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: odograph | May 05, 2005 at 01:58 PM </p> <br>

<p>Hybrids are great, and I agree that we should work to insure incentives are 
in place to purchase the clean and efficient models - but there's no reason to 
attack clean diesel technology.</p> 
<p>Hybrid gasoline, clean diesel, and hybrid clean diesel all have a place in 
our future. FedEx is already using diesel hybrids in some of their delivery 
trucks. Hybrid and clean diesel are complimentary technologies - not competing.
</p> 
<p>I own a two 2004 VW diesels and fuel both with fuel grown right in my home 
state of Virginia - B100 Soy Biodiesel. Absolutely no petroleum, a completely 
renewably fueled with a closed carbon cycle resulting in a net of ZERO CO2 
emissions. Biofuels are another complimentary technology which can be 
implemented immediately in any diesel powered or flex fueled vehicle.</p> 
<p>Additionally, beginning next year, diesel fuel in the US will be ULSD 
(Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) which will enable diesel emisions to be fantastically 
cleaner. The new clean diesel fuel will enable advanced diesel emmissions 
systems to be employed and virtually eliminate all diesel NOx and particulate 
emissions.</p> 
<p>Overall, the work you're doing is great. Just achnowledge that our nation's 
energy and emissions goals must be approached from a number clean engine and 
clean fuel directions.</p> 
<p>Mercury already has a PZEV diesel-hybrid engine in development:<br>

http://www.mercuryvehicles.com/extras/news/01_10_05_mer_meta_one.asp</p> 
<p>The clean diesel legislation you are trying to undo does not provide 
incentives for the diesel engines and fuels of the past - it is aimed at the 
clean diesel fuel and clean diesel engines of the future.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that I cannot imagine the clean diesel enthusiasts 
I know attacking and attempting to undo legislation that provides incentives 
for hybrids.</p> 
<p>Isn't there a better use of UCS time and energy?</p> 
<p>Personally, I look forward to buying a clean-diesel hybrid that I'll run on 
ULSBioD :) Clean Diesel efficiency, plus hybrid efficiency, plus a sustainable 
and renewable biofuel, plus advanced PZEV emissions... what's not to like!?!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Odograph and ScottN - thanks for the thoughts. I agree that the details are 
important and that there does seem to be potential problems. I hope that the 
diesel incentives don't encourage more guzzling.</p> 
<p>ScottN - while it is true that our beloved gov't decided to cut the 
non-diesel incentives, I propose that your time would be best spent with the 
positive message - ensure that incentives continue for all 'green' vehicles. 
The point of contention I have is that the messages here seem largely to be 
anti-diesel.</p> 
<p>I did read &quot;The Diesel Dilemma&quot; and it does raise some valid 
points.</p> 
<p>As for the B2 etc. - sure, that's a farce. But that argument is throwing 
the baby out with the bathwater. I could just as easily point to the misleading 
claims made for hybrids or hydrogen etc. But that simply skirts the real issues 
- all these technologies can contribute substantially to the global reduction 
of conventional oil consumption.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, I agree with Mike Briggs. The right solution is to tax oil so 
that alternatives become much more desirable to the general public and remain 
competitive. We need long term solutions.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Ted Inoue | May 05, 2005 at 06:53 PM </p> <br>

<p>Hear, hear Sharkey!</p> 
<p>Mike Briggs: If you are talking serious policy efforts here, I'd suggest 
implementing the countervailing tax reduction as a deductible on employment 
taxes rather than a reduction in income taxes. People who are making their 
money from investments don't need to drive to work.</p> 
<p>I bought a diesel last year because it was what I could get (I couldn't 
even find a Prius to sit in, let alone test drive) but I'm strongly pro 
plug-in-hybrid. The potential of the PIH for slashing need for fuel of all 
kinds should not be underestimated. I have some analysis of a slightly radical 
proposal athttp://ergosphere.blogspot.com/2005/03/forty-two.html and plenty 
more elsewhere at The Ergosphere:http://ergosphere.blogspot.com/</p> 
<p>NB: Stripping HTML without prior notice or warning that it is being done 
(especially from the poster's edit window) is unspeakably rude.<br>

<p>Is there any sort of pollution information that you have regarding the 
construction of hybrid vehicles and their batteries? How about when they wreck 
and cause toxic spills harmful to both the occupants and the rescue personel?
</p> 
<p>It's not a jab, I am just curious.</p> <br>
