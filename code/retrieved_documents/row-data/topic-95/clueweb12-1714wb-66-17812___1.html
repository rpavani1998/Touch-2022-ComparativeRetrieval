<h1>Volvo's Hybrid Car Campaign</h1> 
<p>By Brad Berman &middot; October 06, 2008</p> 
<p>Volvo loyalists have been wondering for some time now about the Swedish 
carmaker&rsquo;s near-term plans for producing an eco-friendly offering within 
its lineup. The Ford subsidiary has shown several hybrid concept vehicles at 
various international auto shows, but there have been no formal announcements 
about taking any green ideas to market. Until now.</p> 
<p>If Volvo delivers on its hybrid plans, in a few short years the company 
could have micro-hybrids, diesel-hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and clean diesel 
offerings.</p> 
<p>Volvo&rsquo;s green campaign will begin&mdash;according to company 
announcements&mdash;in 2010 when the company implements micro-hybrid stop-start 
technology in several of its smaller gas-powered models. This would include the 
C30 hatchback, the S40 sedan, and the V50 wagon. Larger vehicles would receive 
the new system in the following year. The stop-start system&mdash;designed to 
prevent unnecessary gas usage when the vehicle is at a standstill&mdash;is 
estimated to improve fuel efficiency by about five percent.</p> 
<p>The C30, S40, and V50 will also be part of Volvo&rsquo;s DRIVe initiative, 
which was on display at the 2008 Paris Auto Show last week. First for Europe, 
and then presumably for the US, diesel models will feature a host of 
eco-efficiency features, including increased aerodynamics, the use of lower 
rolling resistance tires, and higher gear ratios.</p> 
<p>Volvo is also considering some common sense steps, such as the elimination 
of V8 powertrains. Offering around 15 to 17 miles per gallon depending on the 
vehicle, V8 engines are out of step with the energy-efficient direction of the 
automotive industry. In a recent press conference, Lex Kerssemakers, senior VP 
of Volvo product strategy, acknowledged that these large engines are no longer 
practical, and may be replaced with turbocharged six-cylinders which offer 
almost as much power while burning 25 percent less fuel.</p> 
<p>And according to <em>Automotive News</em>, Volvo is now planning to combine 
modern diesel technology with a hybrid powertrain to be launched by 2012. The 
brand already has a history of diesel cars, most notably the Volvo 850 Turbo in 
the 1980s. The new system, which will be far cleaner and more efficient, will 
mate a five-cylinder diesel engine with an electric motor driving the rear 
wheels. Volvo&rsquo;s diesel-hybrid technology is initially being targeted for 
the larger vehicles in the line-up, specifically, the S80 sedan and the XC90 
utility.</p> 
<p>Other companies, most notably Volkswagen and PSA Peugeot Citroen, have 
flirted withdiesel-hybrid concepts, but high cost remains an impediment.</p> 
<p>There is also talk of a plug-in hybrid version of the Volvo C30, which 
would allow an electric-only range of about 60 miles. This vehicle was 
previewed as the Recharge Concept at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show.</p>
