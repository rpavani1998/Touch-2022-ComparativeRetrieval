<h1>Diesel In America: 1300 Miles In A BMW 335d</h1>

<p>America and Europe might have this whole hybrid/diesel thing the wrong way 
round. You see, hybrids likeToyota&rsquo;s Prius or Ford&rsquo;s Fusion do the 
best work in stop-start city driving, where their gas engines shut down at 
traffic lights, and their electric motors ease them up to speed again. Diesels, 
on the other hand, like cruising at constant velocities, where their highly 
efficient combustion process allows them to extract the maximum energy out of 
every gallon of fuel. But Europe&rsquo;s ancient cities are perpetually jammed 
with diesels idling at traffic lights, while here in America you regularly see 
hybrids being hustled along freeways at 70-80 mph, their electric motors 
virtually useless.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought America&rsquo;s vast Interstate network, still 
one of the largest and least crowded freeway systems in the world, was made for 
diesels. Which is why I decided to take our BMW 335d long-termer for a roadtrip 
through the southwest via Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma. I figured I would be 
testing the theory as much as the car.</p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which road you take out of L.A.: you have to climb 
up and over some fairly serious hills. The north-bound I-15 hits 4190 feet as 
it crests Cajon Pass en route to Barstow and the junction with I-40, which will 
take us west to Phoenix. With 425 lb-ft of torque on tap between 1750 and 2250 
rpm, the 335d cruises effortlessly up the freeway as it sweeps across the face 
of the San Gabriel Mountains, the 3.0-liter diesel barely breaking a sweat as 
we pass laboring semis.</p> 
<p>Once of the pass, we loaf through the high desert, the engine turning a 
relaxed 2000 rpm at 80 mph. The 335d takes on 12.7 gallons of diesel next 
morning in Scottsdale, which means we&rsquo;ve averaged 31.8 mpg for the 404 
miles from L.A.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We take the long way to Tucson, looping out and around the scenic Apache 
Trail. Winding two-lane blacktop takes us up into the Lost Dutchman State Park, 
named after a rich gold mine supposedly found by Prussian immigrant Jacob Waltz 
in the 1870s. Waltz apparently revealed the location of the mine &mdash; 
reportedly deep in the Superstition Mountains &mdash; on his deathbed, but it 
has never been found.</p> 
<p>The road curls around rugged rock formations and loops between giant 
saguaro cacti. The 335d eats it up, the crisp steering and buttoned-down 
chassis making light work of the constant changes of direction. The blacktop 
ends just as the road begins a steep and winding descent into Fish Creek 
canyon, dropping 900 feet in a mile at one point. We take it easy, wary of 
damaging the 335d&rsquo;s low profile tires on the occasional rocky outcrops.
</p> 
<p>We pass Roosevelt Dam, built in 1911 to ensure a water supply for Phoenix, 
and grab lunch on the old mining town of Globe before heading west along Route 
60 to the junction with Route 79, where we turn south towards Tucson. The open 
two-lane is empty and diesel six growls quietly in the background as the blue 
BMW crosses the vast landscape. The point-and-squirt running on the Apache 
Trail takes its toll &mdash; our fuel consumption for today&rsquo;s 226-mile 
leg has dropped to 29 mpg.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After a night in Tucson, we head south, stopping at the historic San Xavier 
del Bac, the oldest and best-preserved mission church in the southwest. The 
mission was founded in 1700, but the church, with its elaborately carved 
Baroque fa&ccedil;ade, was not completed until almost 100 years later. 
It&rsquo;s Sunday, and the parking lot is filling up with pickup trucks. The 
haunting sound of the church organ mingles with jaunty mariachi music from a 
nearby building, while the delicious aroma of tortillas on hotplates fills the 
air. The southwest doesn&rsquo;t get much more authentic than this.</p> 
<p>We head along Route 86, which loops down towards the Mexican border and 
through the Tohono O&rsquo;Odham Nation before turning north to join I-8 at 
Gila Bend. White and green Border Patrol SUVs lurk in the scrub, and we are 
stopped at a checkpoint. After a legally-resident German-born photo assistant 
working for one of our freelance photographers was held in a cell for almost 
two hours at a Border Patrol checkpoint near the Salton Sea a few years back 
because he didn&rsquo;t have his passport on him, Mrs. MacKenzie (a Brit) and I 
(an Australian) never travel anywhere in the US without our Green Cards. The 
Border Patrol guards check them carefully, then wave us on our way.</p> 
<p>I-8 takes us into Yuma, which Mrs. MacKenzie had thought might be a 
picturesque border town. Let&rsquo;s just say&hellip;it&rsquo;s not. After an 
early fish taco dinner at a roadside diner with a superb view of the 18 
wheelers rumbling past, we drive down to the Colorado River. Mrs. MacKenzie 
wants a glimpse of Mexico, even though it&rsquo;s dark. Using the 335d&rsquo;s 
sat nav map, we drive down a road that looks to end right at the river&rsquo;s 
edge. The river slides by in the darkness below us; on the other side are 
lights in the distance. Mexico.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I look around, trying to spot the Border Patrol. Surely they must be here. 
There&rsquo;s not a vehicle, a person, a light &mdash; anything &mdash; visible 
on the US side of the river, but I can&rsquo;t shake the sensation we&rsquo;re 
being watched. After a couple of minutes, I wheel the 335d around and head back 
to the bright lights of Yuma. Just as we&rsquo;re turning onto the main road, I 
notice a set of headlights in the rear view mirror, maybe half a mile behind 
us. I sit right on the speed limit as the lights slowly get closer. Before long 
they&rsquo;re close enough for me to ID the vehicle as a Tahoe, and just as 
I&rsquo;m wondering how long they&rsquo;re going to tail me, the red-and-blues 
flash.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;So what are you doing here?&rdquo; says the polite Border Patrol 
officer after he&rsquo;s checked our Green Cards, and had a look in the 
335d&rsquo;s trunk to make sure we weren&rsquo;t transporting illegal 
immigrants. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on vacation,&rdquo; I reply. His eyebrows arch: 
&ldquo;In Yuma?!&rdquo; Yeah, yeah, we know&hellip;</p> 
<p>The 358-mile Tucson-to-Yuma leg has returned our best mileage so far 
&mdash; an average of 34.1 mpg. Yuma also proved diesel fuel is more 
consistently priced in Arizona than gas. We&rsquo;ve paid $2.69 a gallon for 
each of the last three tanks, while regular gas has varied from $2.23 to $2.49 
a gallon and premium from $2.53 to $2.75 a gallon. (Back in L.A. our initial 
$2.99 a gallon tank of diesel cost $0.20 a gallon less than regular and $0.38 a 
gallon less than premium.)</p> 
<p>We get a better look at Mexico as we roll along I-8 towards San Diego. At 
one point, as the freeway snakes through the Imperial Dunes, we come within a 
quarter mile of the border. The ugly black fence snaking through the sand is a 
shock; after playing such a pivotal role in bringing down the Berlin Wall, 
it&rsquo;s strangely unsettling to realize America is now one of the few places 
in the world &mdash; other than Israel and Korea &mdash; where you&rsquo;ll now 
see a man-made barrier defining a national border.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just west of Ocotillo, as I-8 climbs out of the desert, we spot what 
appears to be a ruined castle. It&rsquo;s the Desert View Tower, built in the 
early 20th century, and a survivor of an era when America&rsquo;s highways were 
dotted with unique and often oddball roadside attractions instead of identikit 
gas stations and fast-food joints and cheap motels. We call in for a coffee 
before pushing on toward San Diego.</p> 
<p>We make L.A. later that afternoon. After four days and 1304 miles on the 
road, the BMW 335d has averaged 32 mpg without any special eco-driving. It 
grunts like a V-8 &mdash; shrugging off steep climbs and surging past 
slow-moving traffic with the merest wriggle of your right foot &mdash; yet it 
sips fuel almost like a four. This might be acompact car, but it&rsquo;s 
capable of crossing a continent in giant leaps &mdash; based on our experience 
the 335d will easily go 515 miles between fuel stops. Driver and passenger are 
likely to need refueling first.</p> 
<p>Does a diesel make sense in America&rsquo;s wide open spaces? You bet. So 
much so that I&rsquo;m still struggling to understand why, of all the programs 
cash-strapped GM had to cut, it chose to stop work on the new light duty 
4.5-liter Duramax V-8 diesel for the GMT900 pickups and SUVs. This is a land 
where the capability and functionality of a full-size pickup or SUV makes a lot 
of sense. So why shut down a program that would have improved their all-round 
fuel-efficiency by 25 percent with a simple engine swap?</p> 
<p>Maybe GM product planners don&rsquo;t believe diesel has a future in 
America; maybe they&rsquo;re worried people won&rsquo;t pay a premium for a 
diesel engine while gas prices remain low (though we have found places where 
diesel is cheaper than regular gas). But maybe they should think again: a BMW 
source told me recently 30 percent of all X5s sold in America now are diesels. 
The diesel revolution in America is beginning. It would be a shame if Detroit 
missed this one, too.</p>

<p>Whilst its excellent some Americans are beginning to see the benefits of 
the Modern Diesel if you drove a 2 litre BMW 3 series you would have got 
probably 55-60 miles per gallon. I see smaller cars in the USA but they still 
have large engines, what for? Todays smaller engines will do the same job as 
well and for much more MPG, the World I guess will still have to wait for the 
USA to find this out. YOur fuel costs should rise then you may discover</p> <br>

<p>Hi, I am from Costa Rica and I am a taxi driver, I have been driving for 25 
years and my experience with diesel engines is very high. There is absolutely 
no other engine capable of resist and endure hard work as a diesel engine. 
People always think about the inicial cost and the cost of repair, but let me 
tell you that I drove a 1985 Toyota Cressida as taxi for 20 years and after the 
car finished its working years my father kept the car for personal use. The old 
Cressida has 875000 miles ( 1400000 Km ) with the original engine without any 
mayor repair! The engine is a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder, can you think of anything 
better than that? The car was featured in the Toyota Magasine a year ago as one 
of the cars with highest millage in the country without an overhaul. Now I 
drive a 2005 Corolla with 2.0 diesel engine, and after 175000 miles it seems to 
run better than ever! I always tell my friends that if they are going to use 
their car for short distance comute and park it most of the time buy a gasoline 
car, becouse you never get back the extra price of the engine, but if you have 
to put in a lot of miles buy a diesel, they are unbreakable and only need clean 
filters and fresh oil, no tune ups and not electrical parts to bother you!</p>

<p>j85968, you made some interesting comments, but I think a few are a bit off 
course. Heavy duty vehicles benefit from the torque of a diesel, but so do 
light-duty vehicles. Hybrid drivetrains are just as much if not more expensive 
than diesels, (and much more complex) even accounting for the expensive exhaust 
treatment required to satisfy the EPA&rsquo;s ridiculous regulations. Not that 
I&rsquo;m against clean air, but the way they&rsquo;ve gone about regulating 
diesel emissions is absurd. My loaded &rsquo;09 Jetta TDI cost me 19.7k after 
dealer discounts, state sales tax exemption and federal tax credit. Try buying 
a new Prius for that. It&rsquo;s a good car, but this is an apples &amp; 
oranges comparison.</p> 
<p>As far as hybrid vs diesel in mileage, there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of guys 
driving VW TDIs that get similar or better mileage when compared to the Prius 
and those cars aren&rsquo;t underpowered. Your interior room comparison 
didn&rsquo;t make sense. What relevance does that have to powertrains? US tax 
structure does favor gas, but if you think the refineries are making hardly any 
money on gas today you need to check facts. Start with Exxon&rsquo;s profits 
the last two years. Diesel is NOT in limited supply here &ndash; the excess 
that is made is sold in Europe. Just like we buy their excess gasoline. 
Increased demand for diesel here would raise the price temporarily until the 
refineries adjusted their gas/diesel output % to accomodate. You are correct 
about the diesel hybrid being the most efficient. VW is working on one that has 
gotten 69mpg in real-world conditions. That&rsquo;s better than even the Polo 
TDI sold in Europe.</p> <br>

<p>@j85968</p> 
<p>Audi did not come up by themselves and made that commercial. They took 
assessment done by Transportation Authorities and convert it into that spot. 
That assessment that millions of barrels could be sent back &hellip; is 
actually true but we do not know equation for that. It got to be true one way 
or another.</p> 
<p>Now as for refining process, you could argue that we could get less diesel 
than regular gas &hellip; but remants of the refining process are by far 
checmically better then after refining the same oil into gas alone. Do not ask 
me why and how is that possible but it is know fact.</p> 
<p>Now, as per batteries, there is no legislation as of today in USA that car 
manufacturer must take the batteries for recycling. Period. You can not forced 
them to do. But I bet you in few years from now, somebody will come with that 
process and make BIL$ since supplies pf Lithium are either limited or very 
expensive.</p> 
<p>And then at the end &hellip; i guess all those discussion whether 
&ldquo;hybrid or diesel&rdquo; &hellip; all those discussions are politically 
driven. Had Detroit had decent diesel engines they would use it in USA as well. 
But Detroit and gas companies are blowing in the same pipe.</p> 
<p>It is known that insane dude inventor Nicola Tesla (Yes company in CA is 
took his name) drove vehicle in 30&prime; last century from Chicago to New York 
based on Earth magnetic field!!! Can you blieve that? No gas or diesel . .. 
just something to be based on magnets. There are even picture of that vehicle 
&hellip; that is fact that few know &hellip; rumor is that Ford apparently 
bought the patent and holds it for future.</p> <br>

<p>So actually the 25% gain is gas mileage would be offset by the increased 
price of diesal (about 18% more around here) in the US so drivers 
wouldn&rsquo;t save that much in fuel costs&hellip; not enough to pay for the 
diesal motor. So take that back. Diesal may not be that good an idea even for 
full size trucks/SUVs except for those that need to big torque for heavy 
hauling.</p> <br>

<p>Diesel fuel is very comparable to premium unleaded (which would go into a 
regular 335) so you would still get the benefit of the superior mpg even with 
diesel fuel increases.</p> <br>
</li> </ul> </li> 
<li> j85968 Posted on: January 30, 2010&nbsp;12:43 pm Reply <br>

<p>gorluc: thanks for pointing that out&hellip; that&rsquo;s what I suspected. 
Diesal is like oil (thicker) so I suspected it took more oil to make a gallon 
hence the higher energy content. So when Audi talks about sending back millions 
of barrels of oil, is this false advertising? If u are correct then sounds like 
it. The main benefit in that case would be range rather than lowering oil 
consumption.</p> 
<p>as for batteries, aren&rsquo;t the automakers involved in recycling their 
own Hybrid battery packs?&hellip; i would hope so. It seems like it would be 
easier for them to refurbish them and reuse them on the same model of car.</p> 
<br> </li> 
<li> j85968 Posted on: January 30, 2010&nbsp;12:01 pm Reply <br>

<p>It is impressive mileage.. Makes alot of sense for heavy duty vehicles in 
particular where a 25% gain in mpg can mean thousand of $ in savings. The 
hybrid drive is probably just as expensive as a diesal &amp; may not be as 
heavy duty. But many of the pickup truck base motors run on E85 now, &amp; many 
locals in the midwest where pickups are particularly useful &amp; E85 readily 
available like to support the local energy industry/economy. Non-food 
Bio-diesal has great protential though. GM could have offer the duramax in 
their large SUVs&hellip; come in handy for suburban owners, have cylinder 
deactivation &amp; start/stop feature to increase mpg even more. I&rsquo;m sure 
a GMC Yukon or Cadillac Escalade buyers would appreciate a clean-diesal option 
&amp; be willing to pay 3-7k more rather than get the Hybrid w battery that may 
need to be replaced.</p> 
<p>As far as small cars a diesal cannot give the mileage of a dual-mode hybrid 
such as a prius while provide the same interior room. Look at R&amp;Ts test 
(front page).. the diesal&rsquo;s mpg doesn&rsquo;t even come close to the real 
world mileage of a Prius in 90% of driving conditions. Plus w DI I4s in 
mid-size sedans w light weight construction they will soon get ~35mpg highway 
(which is enough for most Americans) &amp; near V6 performance (plenty).. so no 
need to spend the extra cost on building a diesal motor for small to mid-size 
cars here. Plus small turbo I4s will get 40 mpg city w increased performance 
over a larger normally aspirated motor. They make good low end torque.</p> 
<p>The US tax structure favors gas. Plus the refineries are already setup for 
gas &amp; they don&rsquo;t make hardly anything on gas these days and would 
probably not want to invest the money to convert&hellip; right now diesal is in 
limited supply in the US &amp; increased demand would only drive the price 
higher. Seems that Europe should adopt hybrids &amp; battery cars more along w 
diesals w start/stop feature. I think a diesal hybrid would be expensive to 
build, but that would be the most efficient hybrid.</p> <br>

<p>We live 2 months a year in Palermo, Italy where 83% of the cars are diesel. 
And the traffic is unlike anywhere else &ndash; Rome, Naples? forget it. Like a 
race with no rules. One point missed is that diesels idle dead lean, while even 
DFI cars have to be slightly enriched, and all others MUCH enriched. And in 
town, the torque makes all the difference. The Chrysler T&amp;C comes only with 
a 2.8 diesel in Palermo, yet it does fine. I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen a non-diesel 
BMW or VW there, even the 6-series. The diesel smell of yore is gone, a good 
thing since a/c is very rare in the &ldquo;average&rdquo; car (Mazda 2, Hyundai 
Getz or Atos, Ford Fiesta [now THERE is a cool looking car], Fiat Bravo 
[there's another] or Cinquecento). We have a Chevy Matiz, and GM is WAY behind, 
by the way. In the U.S., I drive an 80&prime;s diesel Mercedes as my &ldquo;in 
town&rdquo; car and won&rsquo;t be happy when it dies someday, but know 
I&rsquo;ll get a cleaner car with 50% better milage in what ever used Mercedes 
I buy then.</p> <br>

<p>The reality is that from a barrel of oil, using any refining process, we 
can get twice as much of gas then diesel fuel. On the oher side, here in USA, 
the only recycling battery facility burned to ground few months ago. Whenever 
we see hybrids vehicle, NOBODY but nobody is saying what is or should be 
recycling policy for all those batteries. Think about what crisis we could face 
15-20 years from now when all those batteries go bad. Also, it is known fact 
that around 70% of all Prius I (generation) cars had to replace batteries in 
order to stay hybrid. Another 7,000 $ cost for &ldquo;green owner&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>So to make long story short . . . diesel is way to go for now ntil we find 
better way of building and recycling batteries.</p> <br>

<p>I think the biggest issues facing diesels are the same with any alternative 
power source. Sure diesels aren&rsquo;t new by any means, but the cost 
effectiveness, infrastructure and public image just aren&rsquo;t where they 
need to be to make them viable atm.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s like other have mentioned above, the premium of some diesels 
compared to other models is just too much for people to bear. It&rsquo;s 
similar to the comparison of a Prius to say a Corolla. Sure the Prius gets the 
better mileage, but it&rsquo;s the price premium that takes close to 90,000 
miles to over come that most people don&rsquo;t take into consideration.</p>

<p>The real winner coming to the USA is the Mercedes Benz C250 CDi with manual 
transmission (available right now in the UK and Europe). The engine output is 
identical to my 2006 E320 CDi, 369 foot pound torque and 201 bhp. My 
car&rsquo;s engine is 6 cylinder and 3.2 liter and the new diesel is 2.2 
liters, 4 cylinder with twin turbos. In the C class body this engine does 50 
mpg!</p> 
<p>What I say to the California hybrid nuts is this. Are you serious about 
conserving fuel or just want to say so? The Europeans on average are conserving 
much more fuel than all these tree nuts, 100%. Their petroleum products cost 
two to three times more.</p> <br>

<p>Noted. The HPFP issue is a biggie though, and could win many a 3 series fan 
to the 335d. We don&rsquo;t agree on the significance of the HP though but hey 
the world is a better place since we are all different right:)</p> 
<p>Enjoy the 335d and congrats on the new car:) </p> <br>

<p>If I had the $$ for a 335d I&rsquo;d trade in my &rsquo;09 Jetta TDI in a 
heartbeat. It&rsquo;d be the easiest sale a BMW salesman ever made. Hybrids are 
better choices for folks that do mostly in-town driving but diesels excel on 
the highway. If more folks drove diesels the price of ULSD would go up 
temporarily until the refineries adjusted the gas/diesel output to reflect the 
higher demand. Folks that bash diesels probably have never driven one, 
I&rsquo;d guess.</p> <br>

<p>Completely agree. We need diesels and hybrid/diesels in the U.S. There is a 
whole market being missed by so many people who don&rsquo;t sit in traffic all 
day all around the country.</p> <br>

<p>Horserule: Trust me&hellip;.don&rsquo;t worry about the 265hp vs. 300hp. 
Torque is your friend. And you have more torque than an M3 or a 740i. That, and 
600+ miles per tank will convert many a 335i driver on a test drive, I think. 
It converted me instantly. This is probably the best car I&rsquo;ve ever owned. 
If only BMW put it in the 3 series or 5 series wagons for the US market&hellip;

<p>@PJPHughes</p> 
<p>You are right, I had not considered the eco credit. It will run out soon 
though and the 335i is now coming with incentives. I am not too hung up on the 
425 tq since the car only makes 260hp. The 335i makes 300hp so although you 
might get to 260hp fast, the 335i gets to 300hp pretty fast as well. The other 
point you are right on is the HPFP. I would still take the 335i though. Then 
again you have owned both so your post has more weight than mine:)</p> <br>

<p>Great article. </p> 
<p>We have 2 diesels &rsquo;08 MB GL320 CDI and &rsquo;10 Jetta Sport Wagon 
TDI. Before that we had all kind of cars raging from Honda/Toyota to Porsche 
Cayenne. Clearly, diesel is way to go . . . if you do 40+ miles/day like us.</p>
<p>In GL we can go from Atlanta to Miami w/o any need to refuel. . . in Miami 
we still have a 1/4 of tank. That is around 680 miles!!!! We did it for 3 times 
already. Or we could go from Atlanta to Savannah and back with half tank . And 
we do not drive slow. Board computer NEVER shows average speed below 73 mph!!! 
Jetta on the other hand, can not go below 38 mpg no matter how I drive it. And 
I got already 3 speeding tickets. Did not believe in diesel until I got one!!! 
Just love it. Looking to give a Jetta to my kids and I would buy new or used MB 
E class diesel or BMW. Unfortunately, BMW does not have 5-series in diesel.</p>

<p>Horserule: You&rsquo;re actually incorrect. I bought my 335d with the $4500 
eco credit BMW offered and got the car for less than the equivalent 335i. No 
more chronic high pressure fuel pump issues stranding the car or causing long 
starts(which my ex-335i suffered from), I enjoy diesel prices that are cheaper 
than regular in CA, much smoother throttle tip in, lower CO2 emissions and 
425lb/ft of torquey thrust that makes the car feel faster than the 335i in most 
situations. This car is way more fun to drive than my 335i. And I got 35.3mpg 
on my last long trip. No, it&rsquo;s not a 45mpg Golf TDI, but I bought it for 
a combination of performance AND efficiency.</p> <br>

<p>Great article, Mr. MacKenzie. I don&rsquo;t really understand why GM has 
given up on the light duty diesel idea. It&rsquo;d probably be more fuel 
efficient than my 6 cylinder, 5 speed 4WD Tundra is (crappy performance, but 
21-22 mpg). I&rsquo;d consider a diesel Chevy half-ton as my next 
truck&hellip;but no.</p> 
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Ford also considering a diesel for the new F-150? And if so, 
have they green-lighted or pulled that project?</p> 
<p>Oh and I totally agree with himoses on the smackdown test idea.</p> <br>

<p>This was a good article.</p> 
<p>It is hard for some of us to break free of the image of big smelly trucks 
and plug-in smelly cars.</p> 
<p>It would be nice to see a diesel vs gasoline smackdown test. It should 
include CO2 emissions, mileage, cost, and maitenance. I do mostly city driving. 
I barely even considered the Jetta TDI because of the extra cost and my prior 
experiences with diesels. I also do mostly city driving (95%).</p> 
<p>I liked the point the author made about diesel vehicles being a good 
alternative to hybrids on the highway. When you factor in the cost of batteries 
and the negative impact caused by the heavy metals in the batteries, diesel can 
often be a superior investment to environment conscience buyers. Although, 
coal/nuclear/electric vehicles could change this dynamic fairly soon.</p> <br>

<p>Agree with Angus about how suitable are hybrids for city driving.</p> 
<p>E39M, not sure what you mean about &ldquo;chasing an image&rdquo;, but I 
bought</p> 
<p>my hybrid for economical reasons; most of my driving is in the </p> 
<p>city and a hybrid is perfect for it.</p> 
<p>Wonder when this hybrid car stereotyping will stop.</p> <br>

<p>Agree 100% with what MacKenzie said about the light duty 4.5L GM diesel. 
And to my recollection, the engineering was done, the manufacturing plant 
selection was done, it basically just needed a green light from headquarters. 
If I had to guess, I think it is viewed that if it is too much of a success, it 
would completely kill their efforts with the 2-mode hybrid system.</p> <br>

<p>No point in this one, 335i gets better performance. The cost savings on the 
diesel fuel are wiped out by the premium you pay on the onset. I believe there 
is a concept called time valu of money, a dollar spent now is worth more than a 
dollar spent in the future. So sorry, good article but fails to state the 
obvious, you are better off in a 335i no matter which way you look at it.</p>

<p>We just drove 1348 km in a brand new BMW 335d picked up through BMW&rsquo;s 
European Delivery program in Munich.</p> 
<p>You can read about the adventure of picking up the car at the BMW Welt, the 
drives to Lindau, Berchtesgaden, Ro&szlig;feld, and Graz, and back to Munich, at

<p>I appreciate diesels , but some are a tough pill to swallow. The 6.6L 
Duramax is a $7000 option on the 2010 GMC Sierra, and the 335d is $3350 more 
than the (better performing on paper) 335i.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think GM, Ford, Fiat, or Toyota could sustain truck sales at 
current levels if they had to add $3-7000 (about 15-33% of MSRP) to the base 
half-ton truck to replace the base engine with a 2010 emissions-compliant 
diesel.</p> <br>

<p>&gt; America is now one of the few places in the world &mdash; other than 
Israel and Korea &mdash; where you&rsquo;ll now see a man-made barrier defining 
a national border</p> 
<p>&ndash; Dear Angus, besides tiny Israel and Korea, there is the 1/6th of 
the land on Earth &ndash; Russia &ndash; all surrounded by barbed wire.</p> <br>

<p>I drove a 1999 E55 AMG for 8 years and love it. The only setback was the 
city mileage (13 mpg). With really careful driving mixed mileage was 16 mpg. 
Now I drive a 2006 E320 CDi and I cannot get under 25 mpg mixed! The best was 
40 mpg. Remember this is a 3,800 pound car. Admittedly this model has none of 
the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; emission nonsense and uses no urea. Fantastic. With a 
good tuning box and sawn-off catalytic converter it can hit 250 bhp and 425 
foot pound of torque. The car has 369 foot pound out of the box! The petroleum
</p> 
<p>savings more than made up for the NOX emissions. Diesel engine is the way 
to go. Pity it is killed by Californian tree-huggers.</p> <br>

<p>Although I completely disagree with his hairstyle, MacKenzie can certainly 
write an impressive article. If only more people could see the light. I was 
given a 335d as a loaner when I brought my M5 in for service and I thought it 
was terrific. I normally could care less about MPG, but this was better than I 
expected at nearly 24 in the city. At the same time, the performance was 
startlingly good and I didn&rsquo;t have to drive it gingerly for such a decent 
return in fuel economy. While a BMW isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap and doesn&rsquo;t 
make sense as a cost-saving fuel efficient vehicle&hellip; a Jetta or Golf 
diesel is brilliant. Anyone who&rsquo;d buy a hybrid over one of those is 
clearly someone who&rsquo;d rather ignore the facts and chase an image.</p> <br>

<p>if we pay &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; for our gasoline here in the states, imagine 
how little we&rsquo;ll pay for diesel if demand grows</p> <br>

<p>Great article. I&rsquo;ve long been a proponent of diesel vehicles, and 
with Ford and GM building clean units in Europe, I find it hard to understand 
why they aren&rsquo;t brought over. And the 4.5L Duramax should have been the 
base engine on the pickups, and large SUV&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>Right on! Are you listening, Mr. Whitacre?</p> 
<p>Probably not.</p> <br>
