<br>

<p> Volkswagen will bring the new Beetle TDI diesel (earlier post), unveiled 
at the Chicago Auto Show, to market in the US this summer as a 2013 model. 
Pricing of the diesel model, which is joining the gasoline-fueled Beetle 2.5L 
and Turbo in the lineup, will be announced closer to market launch.</p> 
<p> From 1998 until 2006, the New Beetle was fitted with a 1.9-liter 
turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine. Since then, this engine has been 
heavily revised to accommodate increasing demand for improvements in exhaust 
emissions and acoustics. One of the most fundamental improvements was 
converting the Pumpe Duse (unit injector) fuel-injection system to a 
common-rail design, as well as increasing the capacity by 72 cc thanks to a 
1.5-mm wider bore. (Developed in cooperation with Bosch, the unit injectors 
were located at each cylinder to deliver the fuel for combustion.)</p>

<h3>Volvo using Getrag Powershift 6DCT450 dual clutch transmission with 
start-stop in diesel models</h3> <br>
<br>
<em>The 6DCT450. Click to enlarge.
</em> <br>
<br>

<p> For its S60, V60, V70 and S80 models with 1.6-liter diesel engines, 
available from early 2012, Volvo hasopted for Getrag&rsquo;s six-speed 6DCT450 
Powershift transmission for further reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 
emissions. The S60 diesel with start-stop technology, with 114 g CO2/km (119 g 
CO2/km in the V60, V70 and S80), now achieves the levels of the manual model 
equivalents. This equates to NEDC average fuel economy figures of 4.3 and 4.5 
liters/100 km (55 and 52 mpg US) respectively.</p> 
<p> The transmission&rsquo;s software has been further improved and additional 
economy has been achieved by reducing friction between transmission components. 
The start-stop facility enables a further contribution to fuel economy. To 
achieve this, the 6DCT450 dual-clutch transmission incorporating wet clutches 
needs no additional hardware such as a pressure accumulator or electrically 
driven pump.</p>

<br>

<p> Results of a new study led by a team from West Virginia University suggest 
that urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR)-equipped heavy-duty diesel 
engines operating within the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) operating zone over a critical 
exhaust temperature (about 380 &deg;C) and under favorable ambient dilution 
conditions could contribute to high nanoparticle concentrations to the 
environment. The particle number count under those conditions increased by more 
than an order of magnitude in comparison to DPF-out particle concentrations.</p>
<p> The researchers also found that some of the high temperature modes 
resulted in diesel particulate filter (DPF)-out accumulation mode (between 50 
and 200 nm) particle concentrations an order of magnitude greater than typical 
background PM concentrations. They concluded that sustained NTE operation could 
trigger high-temperature passive regeneration which, in turn, would result in 
lower filtration efficiencies of the DPF that further contributes to the 
increased solid fraction of the PM number count. Their paper is published in 
the ACS journal<i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>. </p>

<h3>Opel introducing sequential double-turbo technology for Insignia; 
&ldquo;twin cooler system&rdquo;</h3> 
<h2>December 05, 2011</h2> <br>
<br>
<em>The new 2.0 CDTI BiTurbo engine 
features a dual intercooler system. At low rpms an additional, water-cooled 
intercooler (small arrow) ensures that the small volume of air from the small 
turbocharger passes in a short and direct path to the combustion chamber. In 
the mid-rpm range, the larger air stream from the larger turbocharger is cooled 
by the larger intercooler. Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p> Opel will introduce a new BiTurbo engine on the Insignia beginning in 
January 2012. The 2.0-liter CDTI power delivers 143 kW (195 hp) and 400 
N&middot;m (295 lb-ft) of torque, with a fuel consumption rating of 4.9 liters 
per 100 kilometers (48 mpg US), or 129 g/km CO2, in the front-wheel-drive 
notchback version. All versions with manual transmission are also equipped with 
Start/Stop.</p> 
<p> The main focus in the development in the 2.0 CDTI BiTurbo engine was to 
ensure a rapid build-up of charge air pressure in the low-rpm range, while 
giving the accelerator added responsiveness in the mid-rpm range. The engine 
air is ideally adjusted according to the rpm range and the needs of the two 
turbochargers of different size.</p>

<br>

<p> Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) are developing a 
small-scale demonstration reactor that will process 40 tons of wood waste per 
year from the university into replacements for diesel fuel and gasoline. TU/e 
aims with this project to demonstrate the viability of small-scale, 
environment-friendly fuel production from its own waste material at competitive 
prices.</p> 
<p> One of the fuels which the university intends to produce is CyclOx, a 
TU/e-patented diesel blending fuel that reduces soot emissions. CyclOx is a 
cyclic oxygenate (earlier post) and represents a class of molecules which 
improve the fuel-air mixing process and reduce soot. The addition of 10% CyclOx 
to standard diesel fuel reduces soot emissions by up to 50%, as shown by recent 
research by Michael Boot MSc PhD in the Combustion Technology group led by 
professor Philip de Goey PhD.</p>

understand atmospheric brown clouds and their effects. Credit: Nicolle Rager 
Fuller, National Science Foundation Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p> Pollution is making Arabian Sea cyclones more intense, according to a 
study in the journal<i>Nature</i>. Historically, prevailing wind shear patterns 
prohibit cyclones in the Arabian Sea from becoming major storms. The<i>Nature
</i> paper suggests that weakening winds have enabled the formation of stronger 
cyclones in recent years&mdash;including storms in 2007 and 2010 that were the 
first recorded storms to enter the Gulf of Oman.</p> 
<p> Researchers note that weakening wind patterns during the last 30 years 
correspond with a buildup of aerosols in the atmosphere over India. The aerosol 
buildup creates formations known as atmospheric brown clouds (ABCs) in which 
smog from diesel emissions, soot and other by-products of biomass burning 
accumulate and become widespread to a degree significant enough to affect 
regional climate. A three-kilometer (1.9-mile)-thick brown cloud has been 
linked to altered rainfall patterns in South Asia, for example.</p>

to qualify a cold start. Credit: ACS, Starck<i>et al.</i> Click to enlarge.</em>
<br> <br>

<p> A team at IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN) in France has developed and 
validated a methodology using a grading system to assess the cold-start 
performance of a diesel engine with a focus on smoke emissions, taking into 
account a variety of parameters including start delay, engine stability, and 
opacity. In a paper in the ACS journal<i>Energy &amp; Fuels</i>, they then 
report on the use of the methodology to assess the impact of cetane number (CN) 
and biodiesel content on the cold-operation performance.</p> 
<p> Although cold-start performance is often related to spark-ignition 
engines, they note, the potential increased use of new combustion modes 
improved with lower compression ratios (CR) (e.g., to values between 14:1 and 
16:1) to reduce raw NOx emissions leads to cold-operation performance issues 
(start delay, idle stability just after start, and smoke opacity) at low 
temperatures (20 &deg;C and below).</p>

<h3>One-step hydrotreatment process for conversion of vegetable oils to 
renewable diesel and LPG</h3> 
<h2>September 06, 2011</h2> 
<p>Researchers from Japan and Mexico have developed a one-step hydrotreatment 
process over catalysts containing Ni-Mo and solid acids for the conversion of 
vegetable oils (Jatropha, palm and canola) to renewable diesel and LPG fuels. A 
paper on their work appears in the ACS journal<i>Energy &amp; Fuels</i>.</p> 
<p>Jatropha oil produced the highest yield (wt %) of renewable diesel (83.5%), 
with 4.9% LPG. Palm oil came second with a renewable diesel yield of 82.1% (LPG 
5.4%); and canola was third with an 81.4% renewable diesel yield and 5.7% LPG. 
The resulting renewable diesel properties varied slightly&mdash;e.g., pour 
points from -10 to -15 &deg;C; density (g/mL) at 25 &deg;C from 0.78 to 0.79; 
and viscosity at 30 &deg;C (mPA/s) from 3.82 to 4.22.</p>

<br> <br>

<p>In a study published in the ACS journal <i>Energy &amp; Fuels</i>, M. P. 
Ashok of Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India reports that adding dimethyl 
ether to an ethanol/diesel emulsion results in an increase in brake thermal 
efficiency and a decrease in specific fuel consumption (SFC), particulate 
matter, smoke density, and oxides of nitrogen compared to either the emulsion 
or a base diesel fuel.</p> 
<p>Emulsification of diesel with ethanol is one of the possible approaches to 
improve fuel economy and reduce emissions of pollutants from diesel engines. 
However, Ashok noted, ethanol addition to diesel results in different 
physicochemical changes in diesel fuel properties, particularly a reduction in 
cetane number, viscosity, and heating value. Ashok started the project by first 
examining the performance of different ethanol/diesel blends: 90D/10E, 80D/20E, 
70D/30E, 60D/40E, and 50D/50E, all prepared on the basis of the water-in-oil 
(W/O)-type emulsion method.</p> 
<p>Ashok selected the 50D/50E ratio as the best of the emulsified blends due 
to its increase in brake thermal efficiency and decrease in specific fuel 
consumption, smoke density (SD) and PM.</p>

<br>

<p>A high ignition quality (high cetane number) fuel is well suited for 
operation under an advanced diesel combustion mode (High Efficiency Clean 
Combustion, HECC) and leads to reductions in all primary pollutant 
emissions&mdash;i.e., THC and CO as well as NOx and PM&mdash;according to 
research by a team from The Pennsylvania State University.</p> 
<p>HECC mode, a premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) process (a Low 
Temperature Combustion, LTC, process), is achievable in current production 
diesel engines by modifying several engine operation parameters via the 
electronic control unit (ECU). Increasing the rate of introduction of exhaust 
gas recirculation (EGR) into the intake air enhances premixing before the onset

<em>World Premiere of the new Volkswagen Beetle, 
Berlin. Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Volkswagen staged the global debut of the third generation of its iconic 
Beetle simultaneously in Shanghai, Berlin and New York. The 2012 Beetle offered 
in the US provides a choice of three engines: the 2.5L gasoline five cylinder; 
the 2.0L TDI Clean Diesel; and the 2.0L TSI turbocharged gasoline engine.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In markets such as Asia, Australia, Europe and New Zealand, the new Beetle 
will be offered exclusively with charged engines. All engine versions&mdash;all 
of them with four cylinders&mdash;are being used for the first time in this 
model series. The car exhibits significantly reduced fuel consumption and 
emission values compared to the previous model thanks to the switch to 
turbo-gasoline (TSI) and common rail turbodiesel direct injection engines 
(TDI). (TDI engines are not offered in China.)</p>

Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Ford developed a new 6.7L V-8 turbo diesel, code named 
&ldquo;Scorpion,&rdquo; for the full-size pickup truck and light commercial 
vehicle markets. At last week&rsquo;s SAE 2011 World Congress, engineers from 
Ford and AVL Powertrain presented a paper on the development of the combustion 
system that delivers a leading 400 hp (298 kW) and 800 lb-ft (1,087 N&middot;m) 
of torque, up from the previous Power Stroke&rsquo;s 350 hp and 650 lb-ft along 
with best-in-class fuel economy.</p> 
<p>The combustion system includes the piston bowl, swirl level, number of 
nozzle holes, fuel spray angle, nozzle tip protrusion, nozzle hydraulic flow, 
and nozzle-hole taper. Joshua Styron, PhD, and his team used computer 
simulations to evaluate the piston bowl shapes, precise placement of the fuel 
spray within the combustion chamber, glow plug positioning and other factors.

<em>Proposed allocation of 2011-2012 
investment plan. Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>The staff of the California Energy Commission has prepared a draft 
2011-2012 Investment Plan for the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle 
Technology Program, its third year of program funding. Anticipated funding for 
fiscal year 2011-2012 is approximately $100 million, with the largest single 
portion ($22 million) proposed to be allocated to medium-and heavy-duty trucks. 
Medium-&nbsp;and heavy-duty vehicles are a significant component of 
California&rsquo;s transportation sector, accounting for a combined 16% of the 
state&rsquo;s petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions within the 
transportation sector; however, these vehicles represent less than 4% of the 
in-state vehicle population. The committee is seeking input from the Advisory 
Committee, stakeholders, and the public regarding the analyses and 
recommendations contained in the draft plan.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>California Assembly Bill 118 (N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, Chapter 750, Statutes of 
2007), created the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology 
Program. The statute, subsequently amended by AB 109 (N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, 
Chapter 313, Statutes of 2008), authorizes the Energy Commission to develop and 
deploy alternative and renewable fuels and advanced transportation technologies 
to help attain the state&rsquo;s climate change policies. The Energy Commission 
has an annual program budget of approximately $100 million to support projects 
that:</p>

<h3>UNEP study: small number of measures targeting black carbon and 
tropospheric ozone could yield immediate climate benefits</h3> 
<h2>February 22, 2011</h2> <br>
<em>Global benefits from full implementation 
of the identified measures in 2030 compared to the reference scenario. The 
climate change benefit is estimated for 2050 and human health and crop benefits 
are for 2030 and beyond. Click to enlarge.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>A small number of emissions reduction measures targeting black carbon (BC) 
and tropospheric ozone (O3) could immediately begin to protect climate, public 
health, water and food security, and ecosystems,according to a study, <em>
Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone</em>, newly 
released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Such measures include the recovery of methane from coal, oil and gas 
extraction and transport; methane capture in waste management; use of 
clean-burning stoves for residential cooking; diesel particulate filters for 
vehicles (some of the largest BC emission reductions are obtained using diesel 
particle filters on high emitting vehicles); and the banning of field burning 
of agricultural waste. Widespread implementation is achievable with existing 
technology but would require significant strategic investment and institutional 
arrangements, the study found.</p>

<h3>3-year trial shows use of NExBTL renewable diesel significantly reduces 
local emissions</h3> 
<h2>February 10, 2011</h2> 
<p>A three-year biofuel trial organized by Neste Oil, Helsinki Region 
Transport (HSL), and Proventia has recently been completed, and the results have
shown that Neste Oil&rsquo;s NExBTL renewable diesel can significantly reduce 
local emissions that have a direct impact on urban air quality. Data collected 
by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland show that particulate emissions 
were reduced by 30% and NOx emissions by 10%.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>During the initial phase of the trial, buses used a blend of 30% NExBTL 
renewable diesel and 70% standard diesel fuel. From 2008 onwards, some ran on 
100% NExBTL. Those running solely on NExBTL renewable diesel achieved the 
largest reductions in emissions. In addition to lower particulate and NOx 
emissions, using NExBTL also results in lower emissions of aromatic PAH 
hydrocarbons.</p>
