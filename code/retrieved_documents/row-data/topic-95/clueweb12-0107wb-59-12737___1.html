<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aerodynamic trucks, natural gas vehicles, 
diesel-electric hybrids and low emission diesel engines are powering 
Kenworth&rsquo;s industry leadership in providing environmentally friendly 
products with excellent performance that can help truck operators enhance fuel 
efficiency and reduce emissions.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Kenworth&rsquo;s diverse product offering is enabling a growing 
number of environmentally conscious fleets and truck operators to drive the 
green highway,&rdquo; said Bill Kozek, Kenworth general manager and PACCAR vice 
president. &ldquo;We applaud those customers who have added Kenworth 
aerodynamic, natural gas and diesel-electric hybrid trucks and adopted the 
latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliant engines as part of their 
efforts to reduce diesel fuel consumption and emissions.&rdquo;</p> <em>
&ldquo;As a result, there&rsquo;s significant interest in our natural gas 
trucks and that interest is expanding into an increasing number of markets in 
the United States and Canada&rdquo;</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Kenworth is the only truck manufacturer to receive the EPA&rsquo;s Clean 
Air Excellence award in recognition of its environmentally friendly products. 
Kenworth&rsquo;s dedication to the green fleet includes the aerodynamic 
Kenworth T660 and Kenworth T700; T440 and W900S liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 
compressed natural gas (CNG) models; T800 LNG trucks; and Kenworth T270 and 
T370 diesel-electric hybrids.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The business is changing as the trend moves toward greener 
trucks,&rdquo; said Andy Douglas, Kenworth national sales manager for specialty 
markets, who has been at the forefront of Kenworth&rsquo;s green charge for the 
past several years. &ldquo;The reality is that high diesel prices and evolving 
environmental rules are leading truck operators to seek practical solutions 
when it comes to their truck purchases in 2011 and beyond.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>According to recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration, the average cost of diesel in the&nbsp;United 
States&nbsp;reached nearly $4 in March. That is up about $1, or 33 percent from 
the same period a year ago.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As a result, there&rsquo;s significant interest in our natural gas 
trucks and that interest is expanding into an increasing number of markets in 
the United States and Canada,&rdquo; said Douglas, who noted that natural gas 
may typically cost at least $1 to $1.50 less than the equivalent diesel fuel 
and is a cleaner burning fuel domestically produced in North America. 
&ldquo;Drayage fleets with port operations were among early purchasers of our 
T800 LNG truck. More recently, companies as diverse as UPS, natural gas 
provider Alagasco in&nbsp;Alabama, and solid waste collector and recycler 
Enviro Express in&nbsp;Connecticut, to name a few, have purchased Kenworth 
natural gas vehicles.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When diesel fuel prices go up, the aerodynamic T660 and T700 &ndash; 
which both hold EPA SmartWay(SM) program certification &ndash; also receive an 
even closer look. The T700 has the lowest aerodynamic drag of any truck in the 
company&rsquo;s history. Both fuel-efficient vehicles offer&nbsp;low operating 
cost, advanced technology, outstanding driver comfort, and high resale value. 
Those are the types of tangible benefits that attract over-the-road 
customers,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Douglas.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Our T270 and T370 diesel-electric hybrids can help enhance&nbsp;fuel 
economy by up to an estimated 30 percent in pickup and delivery applications 
and up to 50 percent in utility operations. That makes them especially 
attractive today to fleets running&nbsp;local routes with a significant number 
of starts and stops, and to municipalities seeking to save on fuel and reduce 
their carbon footprint.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>According to Douglas, there are also a number of federal, state and 
provincial, county, and municipal grant programs and financial incentives 
available to help truck operators purchase natural gas vehicles and 
diesel-electric hybrids. &ldquo;Kenworth and Kenworth dealers are here to 
assist truck operators interested in pursuing such funding.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget about engines. The very low emission 12.9-liter 
PACCAR MX engine achieves U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California 
Air Resources Board (CARB) certification, and meets the stringent emission 
standards of 0.2 grams per brake horsepower hour of NOx and 0.01 grams per 
brake horsepower hour of particulate matter. For medium duty trucks, Kenworth 
offers the low emission PACCAR PX-6 and PACCAR PX-8 engines as standard on its 
medium duty products.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The trucking industry has made great strides with regard to engine 
emission reduction,&rdquo; noted&nbsp;Douglas. &ldquo;For example, with 
everything else being equal, one Class 8 truck with a 2010 EPA clean diesel 
engine produces six times fewer emissions than a Class 8 truck with a 2007 EPA 
engine. That&rsquo;s a positive trend that will grow as more truck operators 
move into the low emission engines.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Kenworth Truck Company is the manufacturer of The World&rsquo;s Best(R) 
heavy and medium duty trucks. Kenworth&rsquo;s Internet home page is at
