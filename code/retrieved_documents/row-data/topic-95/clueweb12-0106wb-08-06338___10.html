<p>Doing so has major implications for public health but moving to a

<br> <em>&ldquo;The additional taxes on diesel cars can generate resources to 
produce clean diesel for all segments to meet public health objectives&rdquo;
</em>
<p></p> 
<p>There is a new number game in town. To stave off the pressure to put high 
tax on diesel cars, the automobile industry is desperate to prove that cars use 
less than one per cent of the country&rsquo;s diesel. It is out to kill any 
proposal to equalise the fuel tax burden on all cars &mdash; petrol and diesel. 
This number jugglery diverts attention from the enormous revenue and 
under-recovery losses from under-priced and under-taxed fuel used in cars.</p> 
<p>With each litre of petrol replaced by diesel to run a car, the excise 
earnings drop seven times. These losses will compound with the increased share 
of diesel cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). The effect is so dramatic 
that the excise earnings from both diesel and petrol has nearly equalled. 
Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell says the diesel consumption growth rate 
has outstripped that of petrol.</p> 
<p>Industry&rsquo;s clever ploy is to contrast diesel use in cars with other 
sectors of the economy. This hides the massive dieselisation of the car 
segment. Industry&rsquo;s own estimates confirm that diesel is already 40 per 
cent of the total fuel used in the car and SUV segments. Diesel cars now 
account for over 40 per cent of total sales from four per cent in 2000; in 
popular models diesel car sales account for 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Despite 
the recession, diesel-car sales have jumped 34 per cent in 2010-11.</p> 
<p>Diesel&rsquo;s lure adds to revenue losses. Only from the diesel used by 
the new diesel cars sold in 2010-11, the Centre is estimated to have lost Rs 
800 crore in fuel excise. From the on-road fleet the loss is staggering, close 
to Rs 3,000 crore. This loss will compound with high annual sales. Losses from 
other central and state taxes are not even accounted for.</p> 
<p>At stake in this diesel gamble is our health. The media is already abuzz 
with spiralling cancer risks in Indian cities. Policies must reduce 
environmental risk factors that include toxic diesel emissions. The World 
Health Organisation, International Agency for Cancer Research, California Air 
Resources Board and US Environmental Protection Agency have branded diesel 
particulates as human carcinogens and implicated them for lung cancer that is 
also rising in our cities.</p> 
<p>Diesel cars also have the legal license to emit more particulate matter and 
nitrogen oxides that are of special concern in cities. Other governments 
consider these risks before taking a decision. Should our policies trade 
ill-health for profits?</p> 
<p>The car industry defends itself saying diesel cars are increasing in 
Europe. Mercedes Benz has lobbied against disincentive for diesel cars. But 
they hide the fact that Europe has moved to more advanced technologies and 
clean diesel with 10 ppm sulphur. Indian diesel is heavy with 350 ppm sulphur 
(50 ppm in few cities). India needs clean diesel too, not just for cars but 
also for its captive users, buses and trucks. But the auto industry has not 
been given any further target for improving emissions levels.</p> 
<p>The additional taxes on diesel cars can generate resources to produce clean 
diesel for all segments to meet public health objectives.</p> 
<p>Cheap diesel is also pushing the market towards bigger cars and SUVs that 
guzzle more fuel, and undermines fuel-efficiency advantages of small cars. High 
petrol prices have kept the bulk of the petrol car sales &ndash; as much as 87 
per cent &ndash; below 1200 cc engine. But more than 40 per cent of diesel cars 
are above 1500 cc. Last year, the SUV segment registered a 41 per cent growth 
rate. This trend will explode.</p> 
<p>Instead of playing this fallacious game of how little diesel cars use 
compared to power plants and industry, our government has to come clean on 
actual losses on account of use of diesel in cars vis-a-vis petrol cars and 
two-wheelers. And slap additional tax on diesel cars to equalise the tax burden 
for all personal vehicle usage and reduce public health risk.</p> 
<p>Other governments have acted. Brazil has banned diesel cars as it taxes 
diesel low. In Denmark, diesel cars are taxed higher to offset the lower prices 
of the fuel. In China, taxes do not differentiate between petrol and diesel, 
while Sri Lanka uses taxation to discourage diesel cars and has reversed the 
dieselisation trend and diesel fuel consumption in its transport sector. The 
message is clear; profits must not get priority over our health.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Imposing an additional tax on diesel cars will have negative 
effects on sales. This will act as a deterrent in the development of diesel 
technology&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p>With the increase in petrol prices in 2011, the automotive industry has 
witnessed a massive shift within the rising gap between petrol and diesel 
prices. Especially after the government deregulated the price of petrol while 
maintaining the subsidy on diesel, the market has seen a spurt in demand for 
diesel cars. Diesel cars, which contributed to about 23 per cent of the overall 
car market a few years ago, now command close to a 52 per cent share.</p> 
<p>Diesel technology has evolved over the years and we have witnessed an 
outstanding improvement in the efficiency of engines. Carbon emissions by 
diesel vehicles have been curtailed significantly and are well below the 
stipulated limits according to Indian standards, while NVH (Noise, Vibration 
and Harshness) levels have substantially improved.</p> 
<p>Hybrids currently enjoy frontrunner status among environmentally-conscious 
car buyers. But a recent study conducted by the RAND Corporation USA suggests 
that state-of-the-art diesel technology has shown advancements over hybrids and 
ethanol vehicles, both for the consumer and for the environment. When factors 
like the cost of making and transporting fuels, cost to the consumer and 
various other impacts including that on energy security are considered, diesel 
fuel stacks up well against other green alternatives currently on offer.</p> 
<p>It has been widely proven, over the course of a vehicle&rsquo;s lifetime 
that advanced diesel technology translates to greater savings. The RAND study 
also gives clean diesel engines a slight nod over hybrids from a social point 
of view. After factoring in the cost of hybrid technology vis-a-vis the 
increased performance of diesel engines, diesel technology holds a 
cost-effective advantage.</p> 
<p>Most top-end vehicles and luxury vehicles today are developed on diesel 
platforms because of the power and efficiency they impart to the car. Diesel 
has also been established as a cleaner and better fuel alternative compared to 
petrol. Excellent reliability and durability of the engines are one of the main 
reasons diesel engines are widely used in commercial applications.</p> 
<p>2012 has shown signs of revival and stabilisation that are very positive 
for the automotive industry. All auto companies are looking at developing 
diesel technology for their cars &mdash; but this is not to only reap the 
benefits given the current scenario but for a more balanced bouquet of 
offerings.</p> 
<p>Customers across segments want to pay less for maintenance but still want 
more powerful vehicles in return for their hard-earned money. Imposing an 
additional tax on diesel cars will have negative effects on sales. This will 
act as a deterrent in the development of diesel technology. Besides, diesel 
cars already cost more than those that run on petrol &mdash; whether they fall 
in the sub-1,400cc category or above it.</p> 
<p>A levy on diesel cars will only reduce future subsidies by shifting demand 
to petrol cars. The bulk of diesel usage goes towards commercial vehicles, 
diesel power generating sets and agricultural pump-sets, so imposing taxes on 
diesel cars and consequently raising diesel car prices may reduce diesel usage, 
but not much. The fundamental problem will remain.</p> 
<p>Diesel is more fuel-efficient than petrol &mdash; usually 10-30 per cent, 
depending on where and how the car is driven. And since diesel consumption 
depends on the total number of diesel cars on the roads &ndash; those bought 
over the last 15 years, and not just the incremental cars sold this year 
&ndash; the actual petrol-diesel consumption ratio will be far below 20-25 per 
cent.</p> 
<p>It is the government&rsquo;s diesel subsidy policy that has driven car 
manufacturers to opt for their respective dieselisation programmes. The logical 
way to proceed is by raising diesel prices marginally. Yes, this may have 
negative fallout that will be seen on commercial vehicles &ndash; trucks, 
buses, light commercial vehicles &ndash; but this can be compensated by 
introducing lower taxes on new vehicles and on parts and components.</p> 
<p>It makes more sense for the government to move to a market-linked pricing 
policy for diesel instead of simply taxing diesel cars. The way ahead for the 
industry should be to develop better technologies by incentivising research and 
development not only on diesel engines but across all sorts of fuels. The 
objective should be to continue to make vehicles more economical, 
fuel-efficient and eco-friendly for Indian roads.</p> <br>

will solve this diesel fuel tax system our government and those who from the 
left who SEE the only way is to tax anything and everything. Wouldn't you know 
its a woman, speaking for taxing diesel fuel. <br>

One can 
understand that the Association of the Car and SUV manufacturers, supported by 
even one Union minister, is making all efforts to restrain the Union Finance 
ministry from levying a special excise duty on such diesel driven vehicles. The 
industry lobby's claim that these vehicles consume 'negligible' quantity of the 
total diesel sold in the country is simply not based on any serious research, 
but an attempt to delay the inevitable. The estimates made by CSE and other 
organizations may not be entirely correct but they do make a convincing case 
for additional excise duty on such vehicles. The ball is in the court of Union 
Finance Minister and for interest of the country and it is citizens' hope that 
he would take an appropriate decision to end the unjustifiable subsidy enjoyed 
by the owners of diesel driven cars and SUVs. <br>

If the government 
will not change its fiscal policies, the automobile industry can hardly be 
faulted for playing the arbitrage opportunity. Indians are supposed to have 
resilient lungs. <br>
