<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong></p> 
<p><strong>THE PEUGEOT 3008 HYBRID4 &ndash; THE WORLD&rsquo;S FIRST DIESEL 
HYBRID VEHICLE</strong></p> 
<p>* Powered by a 2.0 litre 163 bhp HDi diesel engine and a 37bhp electric 
motor</p> 
<p>* Potential 74.4mpg, with 99g/km of CO2</p> 
<p>* All electric mode (Zero Emission Vehicle)</p> 
<p>* A maximum combined power output of 200 bhp</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008 Crossover, with HYbrid4 technology, is the first diesel 
&lsquo;Full Hybrid&rsquo; production car in the world</p> 
<p>By launching the world&rsquo;s first diesel full hybrid vehicle &ndash; the 
3008 HYbrid 4 &ndash; Peugeot will be writing a new chapter in motoring 
history. The combination of a fuel efficient 2.0 litre 163 bhp HDi diesel 
engine and a 37 bhp electric motor is the optimal combination for a hybrid 
vehicle. Unlike previous hybrid vehicles which have chosen to use a less fuel 
efficient petrol engine, the Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4&prime;s diesel engine 
provides superior Combined Drive Cycle fuel consumption of 74.4mpg, and CO2 
emissions of 99g/km.</p> 
<p>The use of diesel hybrid technology also brings a range of other benefits:
</p> 
<p>* High performance combined with excellent driveability</p> 
<p>* Freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four 
different operating modes: ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle), Four-wheel drive, Auto 
and Sport</p> 
<p>* Silent operation, when driving in electric only mode</p> 
<p>* Peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in a four-wheel drive vehicle
</p> 
<p>* Environmental friendliness with CO2 emissions from 99g/km</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008 Hybrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile 
customers who are in search of a rewarding and original vehicle.</p> 
<p>In terms of performance, the Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 benefits from the 
combined power of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration 
and when an immediate surge of power is required (the &ldquo;boost&rdquo; 
function). The maximum combined power output is 200 bhp, 163 bhp from the 2.0 
litre HDi FAP diesel engine and 37 bhp from the electric motor. A maximum 
torque of 500 Nm is available, split with 300Nm at the front from the HDi 
diesel engine and 200 Nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.</p> 
<p>To manage all the available performance a control selector mounted on the 
centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating 
modes.</p> 
<p>* &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; mode: the entire system is automatically controlled, 
including operation of the HDi diesel engine and the electric motor. This 
provides optimal driving for fuel consumption and dynamic performance</p> 
<p>* &ldquo;ZEV&rdquo; mode (Zero Emission Vehicle) provides access to an 
extensive all-electric mode. Activation of the HDi diesel engine is programmed 
to coincide with only more sustained phases of acceleration. This requires the 
high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged and turns the vehicle into a 
&ldquo;city run-around&rdquo; par excellence due to the total absence of noise 
and emissions.</p> 
<p>* Four-wheel drive mode (4WD) instructs both power trains to operate 
together as far as possible; the rear wheels are driven by the electric motor 
and the front wheels by the HDi diesel engine. It offers peace of mind, safety, 
improved driveability and accentuates the vehicle&rsquo;s dynamic character. At 
low speed it allows &ldquo;all-terrain&rdquo; capabilities equivalent to those 
of an SUV. The driver will, therefore, no longer be concerned by the prospect 
of a slippery track or a snowbound uphill drive to a ski resort</p> 
<p>* Sport&rdquo; mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds 
than normal mode. In this mode, the notion of &ldquo;controlled power&rdquo; 
comes into its own, coupling the diesel engine with the electric motor provides 
more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by 
the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal 
to motoring enthusiasts.</p> 
<p>With the Peugeot 3008 equipped with HYbrid4 technology, the aim is to 
appeal to customers who expect both environmental-friendliness and 
technological sophistication, and also genuine driving enjoyment.</p> 
<p>Indeed, as well as the social benefit of the steep reduction in fuel 
consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight 
even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, 
driveability, peace of mind regardless of road conditions and the possibility 
of enjoying silent operation in town in the all-electric mode.</p> 
<p>HYbrid4 technology brings together Peugeot&rsquo;s best technologies and 
experience: HDi diesel engines, electric vehicle knowledge, second-generation 
Stop &amp; Start and electronically-controlled sequential manual gearboxes.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; power train simply combines an HDi diesel engine 
and an electric motor. With their exceptional efficiency, HDi diesel engines 
are thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offer a 30% 
reduction in fuel consumption. Clearly the HDi diesel engine is the best 
internal combustion engine choice.</p> 
<p>For the &ldquo;electric&rdquo; component, Peugeot has historical expertise 
in the field of electric vehicles. To date, the 106 Electric, marketed between 
1995 and 2003, remains the world&rsquo;s best selling zero emissions car (in 
total nearly 10,000 vehicles were produced). At the end of 2010, Peugeot will 
become the first to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in Europe, 
the Peugeot i0n.</p> 
<p>Pursuing the common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing 
components and expertise, it was only natural to use Peugeot&rsquo;s 
electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox, not only for its engine 
management capabilities but also for its ability to optimise fuel consumption. 
To improve performance even further a second-generation STOP &amp; START system 
is also used.</p> 
<p>The choice of hybrid architecture was also guided by the search for optimal 
efficiency and consistency. Hybrid technology uses two power trains which can 
operate alternately or simultaneously:</p> 
<p>* The HDi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on 
longer, out-of-town journeys. A diesel engine still remains the most efficient 
and versatile choice to power any vehicle</p> 
<p>* The electric motor takes over from the HDi diesel engine in phases of 
lower power demands, particularly when pulling away, driving at low speed and 
decelerating (for energy recovery). These are precisely the features that 
characterise urban driving</p> 
<p>Changeover from the HDi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs 
automatically, due to a STOP &amp; START system which places the HDi diesel 
engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (the operation 
of the accelerator pedal, low battery charge level, etc&hellip;).</p> 
<p>The two power sources also complement each other in certain driving 
conditions (&ldquo;boost&rdquo; effect during hard acceleration, or when 
overtaking another vehicle, for example). The performance of the HYbrid4 is 
therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single HDi diesel engine 
of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real 
breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (around 35 
% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).</p> 
<p>The electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) 
are fitted at the rear of the vehicle. This provides a number of advantages not 
only in terms of customer benefits and it also helps reduce costs and optimise 
the production process.</p> 
<p>The original layout of the Hybrid4 system allows for the possibility of 
four-wheel drive. The HDi diesel engine drives the front wheels, while the 
electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.</p> 
<p>Everything is controlled electronically (&ldquo;by wire&rdquo;) and there 
are no mechanical links between the front and the rear drivetrains. This gives 
the system many advantages over a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; mechanical system.
</p> 
<p>* No structural constraints affecting the layout and design within the 
passenger compartment</p> 
<p>* 4&times;4 and environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms
</p> 
<p>The installation at the rear, of all the vehicle&rsquo;s &ldquo;electrical 
components&rdquo;, has further technical and economic benefits.</p> 
<p>Firstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the vehicle&rsquo;s 
engine compartment, while also improving weight distribution. It also leaves 
intact the possibility of using a range of different capacity engines, for 
possible future introduction.</p> 
<p>Secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and 
compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and 
also the rear drive train and suspension.</p> 
<p>The costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the 
technical possibility of deploying the same HYbrid4 technology into different 
market segments, in different body shapes, etc&hellip;, regardless of the type 
of internal combustion engine used.</p> 
<p>A real breakthrough in terms of reducing fuel consumption and CO2 
emissions, while improving dynamic performance levels, providing four-wheel 
drive and an electric only mode, HYbrid4 technology brings a number of benefits 
without compromises.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are 
based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008 Crossover was chosen as the first application of this 
innovative technology.</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 &ndash; In Detail</p> 
<p>2.0 litre HDi FAP 163 bhp diesel engine</p> 
<p>With a capacity of 1997 cm&sup3;, this Euro 5 engine develops a maximum 
power of 163 bhp at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300Nm at 1580 rpm. To 
obtain this level of performance it uses Peugeot&rsquo;s latest generation ECCS 
(Extreme Conventional Combustion System) combustion chamber design, a 
variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump 
allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar and solenoid injectors with eight 
apertures.</p> 
<p>Naturally this is combined with the latest generation 
&ldquo;octosquare&rdquo; Eolys additive-enhanced diesel particulate emission 
filter (FAP) system.</p> 
<p>Electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (BMP6)</p> 
<p>The HDi diesel engine is mated to an electronically-controlled manual 
six-speed sequential gearbox:</p> 
<p>* In automatic mode its electronic control helps provide significant 
savings in fuel consumption, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or 
even a traditional manual gearbox</p> 
<p>* It offers real driving satisfaction derived from the possibility of 
choosing the gear change mode at any time &ndash; manual or automatic &ndash; 
with either the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel</p> 
<p>The gear change quality of the gearbox has been enhanced with HYbrid4 
technology, as the rear electric motor is activated during gear changes to 
improve the smoothness of the operation, and sustains drive in between gear 
changes.</p> 
<p>Latest-generation STOP &amp; START system</p> 
<p>This system places the HDi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at 
a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when 
the vehicle is being driven in electric-only mode. It significantly reduces 
fuel consumption and emissions in urban driving conditions while also 
enabling.the HDi diesel engine to be restarted instantly and smoothly, when 
required.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;high voltage&rdquo; STOP &amp; START system has a maximum output 
of 8 kW and can generate enough energy to supply the power requirements for the 
rear electric motor if required (four-wheel drive mode).</p> 
<p>Rear suspension</p> 
<p>To ensure a dynamic performance on a par with Peugeot&rsquo;s reputable 
road holding standards, the rear electric module also includes a multi-arm rear 
suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.
</p> 
<p>ESP</p> 
<p>The ESP system fitted to the 3008 HYbrid4 incorporates an &ldquo;improved 
traction control system&rdquo; (ASR) able to exploit the car&rsquo;s four-wheel 
drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces. The performance of the 
system can be enhanced by the fitment of optional 16&rdquo; &lsquo;Mud &amp; 
Snow&rsquo; tyres.</p> 
<p>Electric motor</p> 
<p>The synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located at the rear of 
the vehicle. It provides a constant 27 bhp, with a peak output of 37 bhp. It 
generates a constant torque of 100 Nm, or a peak of 200 Nm when necessary.</p> 
<p>PTMU (Power Train Management Unit)</p> 
<p>The PTMU is the electronic control unit that automatically manages the 
different operating modes of the HDi diesel engine and the electric motor, 
programmed to optimise fuel consumption.</p> 
<p>An inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power. The 
inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the electrical 
current supplied from the high-voltage battery pack. It operates in a voltage 
range of between 150 and 270 volts. The converter reduces the 200 volts from 
the high-voltage battery pack into 12 volts to supply the vehicle&rsquo;s 
onboard systems.</p> 
<p>On the Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 all these components have been made as compact 
as possible to optimise the installation and weight effect in the vehicle.</p> 
<p>High-voltage battery pack</p> 
<p>The Ni-MH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries are located under the boot 
floor, near the electric motor. The high-voltage battery pack is in addition to 
the standard 12V battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its 
normal duties.</p> 
<p>In the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in 
terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.</p> 
<p>Energy recovery</p> 
<p>An energy recovery system (the electric motor becomes a generator) enables 
the kinetic energy created by the vehicle to be transformed into electrical 
energy to recharge the Ni-MH batteries during deceleration (release of the 
accelerator pedal and during braking). This recovery system enables the driver 
to re-deploy the &ldquo;free&rdquo; (Kinetic) energy to reduce fuel consumption 
accordingly.</p> 
<p>Man-machine interface</p> 
<p>A 7&rdquo; 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the 
car&rsquo;s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating 
status of the hybrid power train. It also shows, for a given journey, operating 
times in different modes and the status of the battery charge.</p> 
<p>On the instrument panel the left-hand dial indicates the percentage of 
power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration. Different 
scales indicate the battery status: Charge, Eco (optimal operating range), 
Power, Boost (maximum use jointly with the HDi diesel engine).</p> 
<p>Suppliers</p> 
<p>To develop its HYbrid4 technology, the PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n Group has 
teamed up with suppliers offering the best expertise in each field. Based on 
the manufacturer&rsquo;s technical specifications, BOSCH has provided its 
expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the 
reversible high-voltage alternator / generator and other systems managing the 
dialogue between these components, the braking and trajectory correction 
systems (ABS and ESP). Similarly, SANYO has provided its extensive knowledge in 
the field of Ni-MH high-voltage batteries.</p> 
<p>A distinctive design</p> 
<p>The new Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 is distinguished by its cutting-edge 
technology, combining responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by 
its specific styling.</p> 
<p>At the front, Peugeot&rsquo;s latest design cues have been adapted to match 
the 3008&prime;s generous dimensions and to mark a break with existing models. 
The headlamps now have an integral bar of LEDs providing a daytime lighting 
function and accentuate the 3008&prime;s appearance. The 3008 HYbrid4 also 
proudly wears the Marque&rsquo;s new Lion badge on its bonnet.</p> 
<p>At the rear, the rear spoiler has a two-tone finish with a high gloss black 
section, helping to differentiate it from the other 3008 models in the range, 
as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.</p> 
<p>Interior</p> 
<p>Inside its roomy architecture, the driving position bears all the hallmarks 
of a top-of-the-range vehicle, or even that of an aircraft cockpit. An 
expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand&rsquo;s reach and an 
ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the 
&ldquo;pilot&rdquo;. Combined with a raised and dominating driving position it 
has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving 
experiences not previously found in a conventional hybrid vehicle.</p> 
<p>Distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the Crossover 
feel and explore new avenues of expression. This is true in particular of the 
new and specific Gu&eacute;rande &amp; Tramontane two-tone leather finish which 
subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with a black finish on 
the sides of the seats.</p> 
<p>The gear lever with its modern and elegant design is a key feature of the 
HYbrid4 technology. It enhances the technological ambience in the same way as 
the 7&rdquo; colour display which provides information on the flow of energy. A 
specific steering wheel bearing the signature HYbrid4 adds a touch of 
exclusivity to the car.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Multiflex&rdquo; interior</p> 
<p>Due to its intelligent &ldquo;Multiflex&rdquo; interior and clever 
integration of the batteries and the innovative rear suspension, the Peugeot 
3008 HYbrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity 
under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 VDA), with 66 litres (29 dm3 VDA) 
available under the boot floor.</p> 
<p>The split lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped 
with longitudinal securing rings that exude quality and strength. From the 
boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load 
area side trims, allow the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, 
&lsquo;as if by magic&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 HYbrid4 offers a 
perfectly flat floor from the tailgate to the fascia panel. This frees up a 
gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.</p> 
<p>Driving aids:</p> 
<p>Comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the 
equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.</p> 
<p>For example, to ensure that the driver never needs to take an eye off the 
road ahead, and as in a jet aircraft, essential driving information is 
projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the 
instrument panel. The Head-Up Display system can be adjusted by means of toggle 
switches.</p> 
<p>These switches, located above the centre console, add a further touch of 
style to the in-car ambience. They also control another original item of 
equipment &ndash; the Distance Alert system. As its name implies, this function 
helps the driver to keep aware of the safe distance from the vehicle in front, 
according to the 3008&prime;s speed.</p> 
<p>Another item of equipment that helps to ensure maximum driving convenience 
is the Parallel Park Assist (PPA). This system assesses the size of a space 
during parking manoeuvres and determines the possibility of parking in it.</p> 
<p>Similarly, the electric handbrake coupled with the Hill Assist function, 
helps the driver during manoeuvres but also optimises the interior space within 
the vehicle.</p> 
<p>Finally, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide 
users on their travels.</p> 
<p>The Peugeot Connect 3-D Media Navigation (NG4) includes all the benefits of 
the Marque&rsquo;s existing satellite navigation systems. These include a 
juke-box function, linked to a hard disc, Peugeot Connect services, GSM 
function, a USB connector, a DVD player, a Bluetooth&reg; system and a display 
which shows specific buildings in full 3D.</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 is a Crossover with an exceptional technological 
content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving enjoyment 
and CO2 emissions of a very low level. Peugeot&rsquo;s choice of the diesel 
hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental 
demands with driving experiences not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.
</p> 
<p>The 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in France (in Sochaux and Mulhouse) and 
marketed in the spring of 2011 in Europe.</p>  Print  PDF <br>

<p>Wow detailed article!, nice not holding my breath though but sounds pretty 
interesting, but guess not much to say until not vapor-ware, and they become 
avail in U.S. My TDI jetta rocks, so really anxious to see a hybrid diesel 
(just hope is slightly higher off the ground that the jetta).</p> Reply <br>

<p>Makes a lot more sense than a Prius. But I still believe hub-motors like 
the ones proposed by Protean Electric in their concept Opel Vivaro hybrid 
conversion would make even more sense, because there would be at least one 
electric engine working if the other one have a random failure, and none 
transmission loss.</p> Reply <br>
