<p>If you live in a small town where there is no public transportation, you 
understand the importance of having a car. It lets you get to Point A to Point 
B relatively quickly. Walking or riding the bike may not be an option for the 
items that a person needs to carry out his daily life, although most towns of a 
few thousand people will have grocery and drug stores to meet the 
population&rsquo;s needs.</p> 
<p>If you are lower middle class or working poor, you may even want an 
environmentally car, even though most of the newer environmentally cars are out 
of your price range, but in this case, the best step is to get cars with 
smaller engines that will also save on your gasoline costs.</p> 
<p>Finding a good, environmentally friendly car is often a challenge. 
Environmentally conscious magazines sell kits to convert a car to bio diesel, 
ethanol and other fuels. The kits, as long as the buyer installs them properly 
work. Using such kits requires that a person have mechanical competence and a 
lot of time to do the conversion.</p> 
<p>For now, those who are in a situation where they do not have to wait for an 
environmentally friendly vehicle to enter their price range can drive hybrid 
cars,electric cars, or cars that get high gas mileage. The hybrid, as long as 
acceleration is not a concern for the owner is the most viable option. Hybrids 
contain two drive shafts and can switch between all-electric and all-gasoline 
operation. During normal driving, the car will switch trains depending on which 
drive shaft can handle the tasks asked of it more efficiently. Users who run a 
hybrid correctly never have to plug it into an electrical outlet.</p> 
<p>Electrical cars have their own problems. While they do not produce 
emissions, they do not really save fossil fuels. They indirectly burn a 
different type in most areas of the United States. All electric vehicles will 
most likely indirectly use coal, unless a person lives near an electric dam, a 
nuclear power plant, a wind farm, or a solar panel. In the end, electric cars 
are not quite as environmentally friendly as most consumers believe they were. 
Options that make the cars more environmentally friendly are in development, 
but it is best to hold off for now. Limited range has also hurt the sale of the 
purely electric vehicle.</p> 
<p>The most viable option for the moment is to find a car that has good city 
and highway mileage and passes the California emissions test. You will still 
emit carbon dioxide into the air, but you will emit less. High gas mileage 
means you will need less fuel to get back and forth to work, church, school and 
shopping.</p> <br>
