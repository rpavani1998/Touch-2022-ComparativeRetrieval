<p><strong>National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Legislative Summit
</strong><strong>&nbsp;- August 8-11, 2011</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Diesel Technology Forum Hosted Energy Policy Summit Keynote 
Luncheon for National Conference of State Legislatures - August 8th in San 
Antonio.</strong>&nbsp;Read the DTF press release.</p> 
<p><strong>Monday, August 8, 2011&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>State Legislators See and Hear about Clean Diesel&rsquo;s 
Contribution to Greener Transportation</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Allen Schaeffer, Executive Director of the Diesel Technology Forum, 
addressed more than 100 state legislators on diesel&rsquo;s contribution to 
cleaner transportation at the National Conference of State Legislatures&rsquo; 
2011 Energy Policy Summit in San Antonio. The presentation was given as part of 
a sponsored luncheon amidst a diverse display of clean diesel vehicles ranging 
from cars and pickup trucks to a motor grader and a diesel hybrid school bus.
</p> 
<p>Underpinning diesel&rsquo;s advantages is its inherent superior energy 
density compared to other fuels such as gasoline, natural gas and renewable 
fuels. Schaeffer noted that this, together with diesel&rsquo;s low emissions, 
durability, efficiency and availability, meant that clean diesel would play a 
strong role in establishing a sustainable energy future. &nbsp;He added that 
the growing use of hybrid technologies and renewable diesel fuels in concert 
with diesel engines would enable significant savings in petroleum consumption 
and CO2 emissions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With a new Ram 3500 Laramie pickup truck beside him, Schaeffer showed how 
the purchase of heavy-duty diesel pickup trucks sold from 2003-2007 would save 
37 times more CO2 emissions and 25 times more fuel than would be saved by the 
number of Prius purchases during these same four years. &nbsp;He noted that 
there was no one silver bullet, but rather several silver technology pellets 
that would all contribute to the realization of a greener transportation 
future; however the lack of available alternatives, particularly in the 
construction, locomotive and marine sectors, would mean that clean diesel 
technology would be part of our transportation system for the foreseeable 
future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Clean Diesel Delivers Lunch to State Legislators</strong></p> 
<p>The Diesel Technology Forum hosted a Texas barbecue lunch for state 
legislators in the shadow of several clean diesel vehicles during the National 
Conference of State Legislatures&rsquo; Annual Legislative Summit in San 
Antonio, TX .&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 3.000 attendees were on hand to see the 
vehicles and learn about the changes in diesel technology.</p> 
<p>Legislators, legislatives staff and their guests were treated to a variety 
of clean diesel technology including a Thomas Built Buses Diesel-Electric 
Hybrid School Bus; a Caterpillar Motor Grader; a Peterbilt truck with a Cummins 
2010 ISX15 engine; a Deere Gator 4x4 Diesel;&nbsp; a Volkswagen Jetta TDI and 
the newest heavy-duty diesel pickup trucks from Ford, GM and Chrysler.&nbsp; 
This display complemented the John Deere Row Crop Tractor which many 
legislators had already enjoyed climbing into at DTF&rsquo;s exhibit hall booth.
</p> 
<p>Several attendees took advantage of the rare opportunity to sit in the 
roomy new Peterbilt Class 8 tractor or the snazzy little 4x4 diesel Gator.&nbsp;
They learned about each vehicles&rsquo; fuel economy and emissions benefits, 
with many using their newfound knowledge to answer a quiz for the possibility 
of winning a $100 fuel card.&nbsp; Although one legislator confessed, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather win that pretty new 2011 GMC Sierra truck.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
With Texas being the home of the largest number of diesel pickup trucks in the 
country, he added, &ldquo;this could help boost our fuel economy numbers back 
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Making Transportation and Goods Movement Leaner, Cleaner &amp; 
Greener&nbsp;Using Renewable Fuels and Advanced Diesel Technologies to Reduce 
Petroleum Consumption&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Diesel engines have been the cornerstone of key sectors of the U.S. economy 
&ndash; transportation, manufacturing, mining and farming &ndash; for over half 
a century.&nbsp; Diesel technology has continuously improved, virtually 
eliminating emissions from today&rsquo;s heavy-duty diesel trucks. 
&nbsp;Although today&rsquo;s diesel engines still run primarily on diesel fuel, 
these needs are being reduced through engine and vehicle enhancements, 
application of hybrid technologies and greater use of renewable diesel 
fuels.&nbsp; Most importantly, these technologies will be available more 
quickly and at less cost than others that require significant infrastructure 
investments.</p> 
<p>This three-part luncheon series discussed how commercial availability of 
renewable diesel fuel and further fuel economy enhancements such as those 
currently underway in DOE&rsquo;s vehicle technologies program make diesel 
technology a smart, high-value, low-cost investment for reducing 
America&rsquo;s dependence on petroleum.</p>

<p><strong>Driving Home the Point:&nbsp;Reducing Consumer Petroleum Use with 
Diesel Vehicles</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>July 8, 2011</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As fuel prices remain high and individuals look for greater value for their 
dollar, consumers are increasingly looking at clean diesel cars as being both 
an economically and environmentally smart choice.&nbsp; On Friday, July 8, 
three vehicle and fuel specialists shared their insight into the growing 
interest in diesel vehicles and the petroleum saving benefits that can be 
gained at both a personal and national level through greater penetration of 
diesel vehicles in the American marketplace.</p> 
<p>Despite the tremendous attention focused on hybrid electric vehicles, 
internal combustion engines will still dominate the market for many years, 
accounting for 80 percent of global passenger vehicles in 2020 compared to just 
nine percent for electric hybrids.&nbsp; Today one in every 20 consumers choose 
a hybrid vehicle if the technology is available for their selected model, 
however recent trends show that six out of every 20 choose a diesel option if 
it is available.&nbsp; According to Alex Freitag, Director of Diesel Systems 
Engineering from Robert Bosch Corporation, this &ldquo;take rate&rdquo; for 
diesel vehicles is due in large part to clean diesel&rsquo;s total cost of 
ownership advantage (accounting for fuel costs, greater efficiency and higher 
resale value), essentially paying for itself within 18 months of purchase.&nbsp;
Complementing these economic benefits are clean diesel&rsquo;s extremely low 
emissions, including approximately 20 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions 
than gasoline counterparts due to the vehicle&rsquo;s greater efficiency.&nbsp; 
Freitag highlighted this point with an EIA study done in 2009 which asserted 
that a clean diesel vehicle using B20 could have fewer GHG emissions than a 
typical plug in hybrid.</p> 
<p>Stuart Johnson, Manager of Volkswagen&rsquo;s Engineering and Environmental 
Office, echoed many of Freitag&rsquo;s comments, noting that the take rate on 
VW&rsquo;s diesel golf and the Audi A3 were approximately 50 percent with the 
Jetta TDI Sportswagen reaching&nbsp; 80 percent.&nbsp; Due to this strong 
demand for its diesel vehicles and their superior environmental performance, VW 
sees clean diesel as a key factor in its strategy for meeting tighter fuel 
economy standards and other anticipated environmental standards.&nbsp; 
Volkswagen recently opened a new manufacturing plant in Chattanooga, TN which 
will help the company meet anticipated strong demand for the its new clean 
diesel Passat.&nbsp; Johnson was confident that greater volumes of renewable 
fuels would be used in the coming years which would help reduce the demand for 
imported petroleum.&nbsp; He noted that VW currently warranties its vehicles to 
use B5 biodiesel blends, but that the trend for growing use of higher blends 
would continue as fuel quality continues to improve and manufacturers address 
concerns related to the highly sensitive and sophisticated technologies being 
used on today&rsquo;s clean diesel vehicles.</p> 
<p>Finally Bob McCormick, Principle Engineer for Fuels Performance at the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory talked about DOE&rsquo;s non-petroleum 
based fuels program which includes work on the performance of B20 and 
hydrocarbon renewable diesel fuels in today&rsquo;s vehicles.&nbsp; McCormick 
explained that the RFS2 had created a market for renewable diesel fuels, many 
of which were at varying stages of development.&nbsp; Traditional 
&ldquo;FAME&rdquo; biodiesel, which is classified as an advanced biofuel due to 
its 50 percent lower GHG emissions than petroleum fuel, had record production 
in May of this year and was on track to provide the mandated volume of 1 
billion gallons in 2012. Like Johnson, he highlighted the improved quality of 
biodiesel fuels today, noting that testing had generally shown little or no 
impact on fuel economy, catalyst durability and NOx emissions when used as a 
B20 blend.&nbsp; As for next generation renewable diesel fuel, McCormick noted 
that there was already commercial production of this fuel from poultry fat in 
the U.S (70 million gallons/yr) and that these fuels, which are hydrocarbons 
meeting the same ASTM standard as petroleum diesel, were being developed from a 
variety of feedstocks and had shown exceptional fuel properties.</p>

<p><strong>Reducing Petroleum Use on the Road and at the Jobsite</strong></p> 
<p><strong>June 17, 2011</strong></p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s heavy-duty trucks are 98 percent cleaner than those made 10 
years ago and this same technology is being phased in across all diesel 
applications, but more is being done.&nbsp; Industry is working with 
DOE&rsquo;s SuperTruck program to increase heavy-duty vehicle efficiency 
through improved aerodynamics and a suite of engine technology improvements.
&nbsp;High fuel economy gains are driving demand for diesel hybrid buses, 
making them the technology of choice for many of the country&rsquo;s top 
transit districts.&nbsp; Even many work trucks found in communities across the 
country are integrating hybrid technologies to reduce fuel consumption.&nbsp; 
Four speakers explained how&nbsp; R&amp;D investments are bringing more 
efficient technologies to market for use in truck fleets.</p>

<p><strong>Fueling the Future in a Green Economy</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>May 13, 2011</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Over the last several years, petroleum diesel fuel has become increasingly 
cleaner as sulfur levels were reduced, similar to taking the lead out of 
gasoline. It is also becoming more expensive, making the switch to renewable 
fuels one which will provide both environmental and economic benefits. This 
briefing looked at diesel fuel demand and prices, the growing use of biodiesel 
along the I-75 corridor running from Michigan to Florida, and the development 
of next generation, commercially available, drop-in renewable diesel fuel.</p> 
<p>A near-capacity room of Congressional staff members, industry and energy 
representatives gathered on Capitol Hill to hear a diverse group of speakers 
&ndash; including U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett &ndash; discuss clean diesel 
technology and renewable diesel&rsquo;s role in &ldquo;Fueling the Future in a 
Green Economy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The three-part Congressional luncheon series focusing on making U.S. 
transportation and goods movement more fuel efficient and 
environmentally-friendly was hosted by the Diesel Technology Forum.&nbsp; The 
luncheon series will closely examine how commercial availability of renewable 
diesel fuel and further fuel economy enhancements such as those currently 
underway in the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s vehicle technologies program 
make diesel technology a smart, high-value, low-cost investment for reducing 
America&rsquo;s dependence on petroleum.</p> 
<p>At the May 13th event, Rep. Bartlett, the co-chairman of the House 
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, opened with remarks about his 
long standing commitment toward developing renewable energy sources for 
America&rsquo;s energy security.&nbsp; He also stressed the importance of 
educating Congress and the American public about the need for a comprehensive 
energy program.</p> 
<p>Rep. Bartlett and staff member Lisa Wright are working closely with the 
Forum in developing the briefing series and informing other Congressional 
members and staff about the events.</p> 
<p>Diesel Technology Forum Executive Director Allen Schaeffer, moderated the 
briefing and also gave a presentation about clean diesel technology, the 
significant reduction in emissions it provides, and diesel&rsquo;s role in a 
sustainable energy future through greater use of&nbsp; diesel hybrid and 
renewable diesel technology.</p> 
<p>Terrence Higgins of Hart Energy Consulting gave a detailed presentation 
entitled &ldquo;Clean Diesel Fuel: Demand, Prices, Availability and 
Advantages&rdquo;.&nbsp; Higgins outlined the findings of a Hart Energy study 
conducted for the Diesel Technology Forum, noting that global demand for diesel 
fuel would grow much faster than demand for gasoline and that refiners were 
accounting for this growth in their expansion plans.&nbsp; He concluded diesel 
would play a significant role in the emergence of the green energy economy 
because of diesel fuel&rsquo;s unique attributes &ndash; its energy density, 
low-sulfur content, widespread availability and compatibility with biofuels.</p>
<p>Charise Stephens, the Executive Director of the Middle Georgia Clean Cities 
Coalition, spoke about the &ldquo;I 75 Green Corridor Project&rdquo; which has 
the goal of establishing I?75 as the nation&rsquo;s longest biofuels corridor.
&nbsp;To accomplish this, several Clean Cities Coalitions are installing enough 
E85 and B20 pumps to allow travel from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to Miami, FL 
on those fuels.&nbsp; So far, Stephens said four stations were completed in 
Lexington, Atlanta, Gainesville and Miami.&nbsp; She also highlighted the 
importance of biodiesel in reducing emissions and dependence on foreign oil.</p>
<p>Joel Velasco, Senior Vice President for Amyris &ndash; the Forum&rsquo;s 
newest member &ndash; discussed Amyris&rsquo; role as an integrated renewable 
products company focused on providing sustainable alternatives to a broad range 
of petroleum-based products. Amyris&rsquo; emergence in renewable fuels came 
about in 2005 as they worked to develop a lower cost, consistent supply of 
artemisinin, a key malaria drug component.&nbsp; Using a similar formula based 
on biomass sugars, Amyris developed hydro-carbon petroleum replacements. The 
company&rsquo;s renewable diesel has been approved by EPA for 35 percent blends.
