<h2> Peugeot: Environmentally Friendly / Green Hybrid Cars</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Peugeot<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>307 CC Hybride: In 2006 Peugeot introduced a diesel hybrid technology 
demonstrator called the 307 CC Hybride HDI.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>The vehicle is fitted with a 1.6-litre HDi diesel engine, a Diesel 
Particle Filter System (DPFS) and an electric motor.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>The electric motor is designed to operate the vehicle in an 
&ldquo;all-electric&rdquo; mode during low speed city/town driving.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li>During fast acceleration the vehicle&rsquo;s 110 hp (82 kW) engine can be 
supplemented by 31 hp (23 kW) provided by the electric motor, with 
a&nbsp;&nbsp; further 12 hp (9 kW) available if required.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>The battery pack contains 240-nickel metal hydride (NiHM) cells, with 
regenerative braking, the kinetic energy recovered during the vehicle&rsquo;s 
deceleration and braking phases, being used to recharge the batteries.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>The vehicle also includes a Stop &amp; Start system (STT).&nbsp;<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li>Because the car has a diesel engine it can use pure biodiesel. See Green 
Cars, Section 3.2.2 (Biodiesel).</li> </ul> </ul> <br>
