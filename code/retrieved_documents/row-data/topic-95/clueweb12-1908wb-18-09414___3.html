<h1>On the Road to a Gas-Free Future</h1>  April 13th 2009 <br>

<p>Someday soon, PSNH and other electric utilities across the nation will be 
providing power for a brand new clean-energy technology: plug-in electric cars. 
Until the electric &quot;Chevy Volt&quot; and heavier-duty plug-ins are 
available for mass consumption, PSNH is taking steps to make its current fleet 
of vehicles as environmentally friendly as possible.</p> 
<h4>Biodiesel Buckets</h4> 
<p>PSNH maintains a fleet of 683 vehicles statewide, including light duty 
trucks for meter readers, and bucket trucks for lineworkers. Starting in April 
of 2008, PSNH began piloting B20 biodiesel in 14 of its bucket trucks in the 
Portsmouth and Rochester areas.</p> <br>

<p>B20 is a blend of 20 percent biofuel and 80 percent petroleum-based diesel. 
At that ratio, no engine modifications are needed to burn the fuel in regular 
diesel engines.</p> 
<p>Since gas stations offering B20 are few and far between, PSNH has the 
biodiesel delivered to its area work centers by Simply Green, a biofuels 
company headquartered in Portsmouth, NH, that offers on-site delivery.</p> 
<p>&quot;In 2008, we used about 14,000 gallons of B20, reducing tailpipe 
carbon dioxide emissions by about 23 tons,&quot; said Jay Joseph, who manages 
PSNH's transportation fleet. &quot;This year, we're expanding the program to 
include 72 of our 101 bucket trucks statewide.&quot;</p> 
<p>With the expanded program, Joseph expects PSNH's bucket truck fleet to use 
about 70,000 gallons of B20 in 2009, replacing more than 14,000 gallons of 
petroleum-based diesel with biofuel, and reducing carbon emissions by 113 tons.
</p> 
<h4>A New Kind of Hybrid</h4> 
<p>Starting this fall, PSNH will begin piloting a new emissions-reduction 
technology to reduce its transportation-related carbon 
footprint&mdash;gas/electric hybrid line trucks. Earlier this year, PSNH was 
awarded a grant through the Granite State Clean Cities Coalition to cover the 
additional cost to purchase two hybrid bucket trucks in place of two 
diesel-only bucket trucks. Today, the price difference is about $75,000 per 
vehicle.</p> 
<p>PSNH has also applied for funds from the state's Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Reduction Fund to cover the incremental cost difference to purchase five 
additional hybrid bucket trucks and 10 hybrid light-duty trucks. This program 
could produce a fuel cost savings of more than $225,000 over 10 years, which 
would be passed along to PSNH customers. Along with cutting fuel costs and 
consumption, the pilot project could help &quot;prove&quot; the hybrid 
technology to the broader marketplace.</p> 
<p>&quot;The hybrid bucket trucks, in particular, are relatively new to the 
market,&quot; said Joseph. &quot;PSNH will be able to gather substantial 
performance data to share with cities and towns, municipal transportation 
fleets, and other utilities.&quot;</p> 
<p>Each hybrid bucket truck replacing a diesel-only bucket truck will reduce 
PSNH's carbon dioxide emissions by more than 13 tons a year. As an additional 
benefit, the aerial units on the hybrid bucket trucks are able to operate off 
the onboard lithium-ion batteries&mdash;meaning that the truck's engine doesn't 
have to be running to perform certain roadside jobs, which also reduces noise 
pollution.</p> <br>
