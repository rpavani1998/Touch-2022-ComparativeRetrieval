<p><br>
<b>The world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental 
protection and driving enjoyment</b><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>By launching the world&rsquo;s first full diesel Hybrid vehicle, the 3008 
HYbrid4, Peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use 
and driving enjoyment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY </strong></p> 
<p>The name HYbrid4 designates the hybridization of a diesel engine (2.0 litre 
HDi FAP 120 kW / 163 bhp) with an electric motor offering a maximum power 
output of 27 kW (37 bhp). Since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol 
engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the 3008 HYbrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination 
of diesel and electric power also paves the way for:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- 4 wheel drive, <br>
 - a maximum power of 200 bhp, <br>
 - ZEV mode (Zero 
Emission Vehicle),<br>
 - 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of CO2. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a 
reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this 
size and performance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>DRIVING PLEASURE </strong></p> 
<p>Contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers 
improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- high performance combined with excellent driveability, </p> 
<p><br>
 - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four 
different operating modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto,</p> 
<p><br>
 - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only 
mode,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, </p> 
<p><br>
 - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of 
CO2.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<strong>A TECHNOLOGICAL AND REWARDING CROSSOVER </strong>
</p> 
<p>The 3008 HYbrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers 
in search of a rewarding and original car. Its benefits reside in its ability 
to fuse together different genres:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of 
the SUV, MPV and saloon,</p> 
<p><br>
 - through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range 
overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and 
status,</p> 
<p><br>
 - through its surprising and technological interior, combining the 
ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coup&eacute; with practical and efficient 
modularity,</p> 
<p><br>
 - through its dynamic specification since thanks to Peugeot&rsquo;s 
expertise and the technologies employed, this &ldquo;tall single 
compartment&rdquo; vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of 
many a saloon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 3008 HYbrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to 
motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of CO2 
emissions.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Peugeot&rsquo;s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is 
possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving 
sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in France (in Sochaux and Mulhouse) and 
marketed in the spring of 2011 in Europe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Peugeot 3008, with HYbrid4 technology, is the first diesel &ldquo;Full 
Hybrid&rdquo; production car to be marketed in the world. This car is the 
culmination of a project which required every ounce of expertise on the part of 
Peugeot&rsquo;s engineers, to obtain a result on a par with the Marque&rsquo;s 
environmental demands while at the same time providing high levels of driving 
enjoyment. It is also an original and virtuous association of diesel and 
electric power.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>3008 + HYbrid4 (DIESEL + ELECTRIC) = VIRTUOUS ASSOCIATION </strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>An obvious association </strong></p> 
<p>Adapting HYbrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense. This 
successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring 
concepts: SUV, saloon, compact MPV, coup&eacute;&hellip; Added to this are the 
benefits of HYbrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines 
diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer 
expectations: &ldquo;ecological&rdquo; four wheel drive, controlled power, a 
high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all 
within an environmentally responsible approach.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Driving enjoyment for the next generation </strong></p> 
<p>For Peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its 
eco-efficiency. It must also provide new driving sensations, improved 
driveability and improved driving enjoyment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new sensations find expression in a number of ways: </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, 
<br> - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, <br>
 
- high performance combined with high levels of driveability,<br>
 - unique 
freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four operating 
modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In terms of performance, the 3008 HYbrid4 can benefit from the combined 
power of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an 
immediate surge in power (&ldquo;boost&rdquo; function). The maximum combined 
power output can then reach 147 kW (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kW 
(163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre HDi FAP diesel engine and the temporary peak of 
the electric motor (27 kW, or 37 bhp).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A maximum torque of 500 Nm is available, split 300 Nm at the front from the 
HDi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 Nm at the rear generated by the electric 
motor.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This level of performance gives the 3008 HYbrid4 record-breaking 
credentials in terms of the CO2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a 
maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 
3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!</p> 
<p>On higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of 
CO2 in the combined cycle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the 
chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities. The rear module of the HYbrid4 
system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee 
of excellent road holding.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Simplicity of use </strong></p> 
<p>From a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console 
enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; mode: the electronics automatically control the entire 
system, including transitions between the HDi diesel engine and the electric 
motor. This allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and 
dynamic driveability,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- &ldquo;ZEV&rdquo; mode (<em>Zero Emission Vehicle</em>) provides access 
to an extensive all-electric mode. In this case, activation of the HDi diesel 
engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration. 
This requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged. The 
vehicle then becomes a &ldquo;city run-around&rdquo; par excellence thanks to 
the total absence of noise and emissions. The driver can apply this mode to 
drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in 
electric mode, etc,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- Four-wheel drive mode (4WD) instructs both power trains to operate 
together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric 
motor and the front wheels by the HDi diesel engine. Offering peace of mind, 
safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle&rsquo;s 
dynamic character. Indeed HYbrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain 
capabilities equivalent to those of an SUV: the driver will no longer be 
worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski 
resort;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine 
speeds than normal mode. In this mode, the notion of &ldquo;controlled 
power&rdquo; comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the 
electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and 
transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and 
driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.</p> 
<p>With a 3008 benefiting from HYbrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to 
customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological 
sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel 
consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight 
even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, 
driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the 
possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>THE HYbrid4 STRATEGY</strong><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>CAPITALISING ON THE BEST KNOW-HOW </strong></p> 
<p>HYbrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies 
developed by Peugeot&rsquo;s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, 
second-generation<em>STOP &amp; START </em>and an electronically-controlled 
sequential manual gearbox.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>AN ORIGINAL HYBRID POWER TRAIN </strong></p> 
<p>The &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; power train basically combines a diesel engine and 
an electric motor.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Initially, Peugeot has relied logically on the recognised expertise of the 
PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n Group in the field of diesel engines with HDi FAP 
technology. With their exceptional efficiency, HDi FAP diesel engines - 
thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering 
like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal 
combustion engine choice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol 
combustion engine may also serve as the base for HYbrid4 type hybridization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the electric component, Peugeot has a historical expertise in the field 
of electric vehicles. To date, the 106 Electric, marketed between 1995 and 
2003, remains the world&rsquo;s highest selling zero emissions car (in total 
the PSA Group produced nearly 10,000 vehicles, making it a genuine industrial 
pioneer in this field). At the end of 2010, Peugeot will continue in this vein 
by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric 
vehicle in Europe, the Peugeot I0n.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing 
components and expertise, it was only natural to use the 
electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (MCP), not only for its engine 
management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption. In 
the same perspective, a second-generation<em>STOP &amp; START </em>system is 
used.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>THE CHOICE OF A PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE </strong></p> 
<p>The choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal 
efficiency and consistency.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or 
simultaneously:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- the HDi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on 
longer, out-of-town journeys. A diesel engine still remains the most efficient 
and versatile choice to power any vehicle,</p> 
<p><br>
 - the electric motor takes over from the HDi diesel engine in phases 
of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed 
and decelerating (energy recovery). These are precisely the features that 
characterise urban driving. Changeover from the HDi diesel engine to the 
electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to a<em>STOP &amp; START </em>
system which places the HDi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and 
when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, 
etc),</p> 
<p><br>
 - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving 
conditions (&ldquo;boost&rdquo; effect during strong acceleration, when 
overtaking another vehicle, for example). The performance of the HYbrid4 is 
therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single HDi diesel engine 
of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real 
breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (around 35% 
less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>AN ORIGINAL AND INTELLIGENT LAYOUT </strong></p> 
<p>The electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) 
are fitted at the rear of the vehicle. This results in a number of advantages 
not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the 
project&rsquo;s economic and industrial model.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Four wheel drive </strong></p> 
<p>This original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the HDi 
diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric 
motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since everything is controlled electronically (&ldquo;<em>By wire</em>
&rdquo;) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system 
has many advantages over a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; integral mechanical 
transmission system (with a prop shafts):</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>- no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the 
passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved);<br>
 - 4x4 and 
environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>A viable technical and economic solution </strong></p> 
<p>The rear installation of the vehicle&rsquo;s &ldquo;electric 
components&rdquo; provides a new technical and economic solution.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Firstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine 
compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution. It also leaves 
intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and 
compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and 
also the rear drive train and suspension.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the 
technical possibility of deploying HYbrid4 technology in different segments, on 
different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and CO2 
emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, 
etc, the HYbrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any 
compromises. Furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the 
system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The 3008 crossover has been chosen as the first application of this 
innovative technology.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE 3008 HYbrid4 </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>AT THE FRONT </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>The 2.0 litre HDi FAP 120 kW (163 bhp) diesel engine </strong></p> 
<p>With a capacity of 1997 cm&sup3;, this Euro 5 engine develops a maximum 
power of 120 kW at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300 Nm at 1580 rpm. To 
obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation ECCS (<em>
Extreme Conventional Combustion System</em>) combustion chamber design, a 
variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump 
allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid 
injectors with eight apertures.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Naturally this is combined with the latest generation 
&ldquo;octosquare&rdquo; Eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter 
(FAP) system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (BMP6) </strong>
</p> 
<p>The HDi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual 
six-speed sequential gearbox:</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>- its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, 
in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a 
traditional manual gearbox,<br>
 - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from 
the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or 
automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.</p> 
<p>Operation of the BMP6 is even more enjoyable with HYbrid4 technology 
insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes. This 
results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Latest-generation </strong><strong>STOP &amp; START </strong>
<strong>system </strong></p> 
<p>This system places the HDi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at 
a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when 
the vehicle is being driven in electric mode.</p> 
<p><br>
 This brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions 
in urban conditions. It also enables the HDi diesel engine to be restarted 
instantly, &ldquo;transparently&rdquo; for the driver, when necessary.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>This &ldquo;high voltage&rdquo; <em>STOP &amp; START </em>system with a 
generous output of 8 kW can also generate the electricity needed for operation 
of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive 
mode).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>AT THE REAR </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rear suspension </strong></p> 
<p>To ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the Marque&rsquo;s road 
holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range MPVs, top of 
the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across 
several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which 
are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the 
Marque&rsquo;s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same 
technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent 
driveability, road holding and comfort.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In terms of &ldquo;vehicle dynamics&rdquo;, the ESP of the 3008 HYbrid4 
incorporates an &ldquo;improved traction control system&rdquo; (ASR) able to 
exploit the car&rsquo;s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on 
challenging surfaces. The performance of this equipment is further enhanced by 
the fitment of optional 16&rsquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Mud &amp; Snow&rdquo; tyres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Electric motor </strong></p> 
<p>The synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the 
rear of the vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It provides a constant 20 kW (27 bhp), and has a peak output of 27 kW (37 
bhp). It generates a constant torque of 100 Nm, or a peak of 200 Nm.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PTMU (Power Train Management Unit) </strong></p> 
<p>The PTMU is an electronic controller that automatically manages the 
different operating modes of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor in a very 
innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power. The 
inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current 
from the high-voltage battery pack.</p> 
<p><br>
 This operates in a voltage range of between 150 and 270 volts. The 
converter converts the 200 volts from the high-voltage battery pack into 12 
volts to supply the vehicle&rsquo;s onboard systems.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the 3008 HYbrid4, these components have been made as small as possible 
to optimise the installation in the vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>High-voltage battery pack </strong></p> 
<p>The Ni-MH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, 
near the electric motor. This high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to 
the standard 12V battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its 
normal duties.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in 
terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Energy recovery </strong></p> 
<p>An energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) 
enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the 
Ni-MH batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking). 
This recovery system enables the driver to use &ldquo;free&rdquo; energy and 
reduce fuel consumption accordingly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Man-machine interface </strong></p> 
<p>A 7&rsquo;&rsquo; 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according 
to the car&rsquo;s specification, informs the driver in real time of the 
operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by 
means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of 
power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration. Three 
different scales indicate the battery status: Charge, Eco (optimal operating 
range), Power.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Suppliers </strong></p> 
<p>To develop its HYbrid4 technology, the PSA Peugeot Citro&euml;n Group has 
teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s technical specifications, <em>BOSCH </em>
has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power 
electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (STT) and other systems 
managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory 
correction systems (ABS and ESP).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Similarly, <em>SANYO </em>has provided its extensive knowledge in the field 
of Ni-MH high-voltage batteries</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p><strong>A DISTINCTIVE STYLE </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>APPEAL AND PROTECTIVE POWER </strong><br>
 The new Peugeot 3008 
HYbrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless 
combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its 
specific styling.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Peugeot designs always bear the stamp of a strong, dynamic and recognisable 
personality, whatever the range concerned. It is nonetheless constantly 
evolving. New developments may be more or less marked according to the 
generation and above all the category of the vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle&rsquo;s high 
innovative content. It also allows the 3008 HYbrid4 to be recognised by the 
integration of familiar features.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the front, Peugeot&rsquo;s stylistic codes have been adapted to the 
car&rsquo;s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before. The 
headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of 
LEDs providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car&rsquo;s 
visual appeal. The 3008 HYbrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, 
but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the Marque&rsquo;s 
new badge on its bonnet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The large front grille helps to define the vehicle&rsquo;s status and 
off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of 
those found in the world of the SUV. The lower front panel further reinforces 
these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers 
aligned with the headlamps.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper 
section. This accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its 
exclusive 17&rsquo;&rsquo; Oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, 
contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the rear, the curved wings blend seamlessly with the hi-tech lights. The 
rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate 
the 3008 HYbrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which 
decorate the sides and rear of the car.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the 
vehicle. Here too, the presence of a &ldquo;<em>hobby</em>&rdquo; lower 
tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, 
illustrate the &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; feel of this crossover.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil 
strength, contained power, controlled dynamism&hellip; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>COMFORT: DRIVING AND SHARING </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>INTERIOR AMBIENCE: A BOLD STATEMENT </strong></p> 
<p>In keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car&rsquo;s 
passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
Inside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks 
of a top-of-the-range coup&eacute;, or even an aircraft cockpit. An expansive 
fascia panel, controls within easy hand&rsquo;s reach and an ergonomic centre 
console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in 
place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not 
previously found in a hybrid vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the 
passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover 
feel and explore new avenues of expression. This is true in particular of the 
new and specific<em>Gu&eacute;rande </em>&amp; <em>Tramontane </em>two-tone 
leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with 
a black finish on the sides of the seats.</p> 
<p><br>
 The gear lever with its modern and elegant design is emblematic of 
HYbrid4 technology. It enhances this technological ambience in the same way as 
the 7&rsquo;&rsquo; colour display which provides information on the energy 
flows. The ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature 
&ldquo;HYbrid4&rdquo; HY for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>MULTIFLEX INTERIOR: VERSATILITY PRESERVED </strong></p> 
<p>While the driver is invited to enjoy renewed driving pleasure, the 3008 
HYbrid4 has a wealth of surprises in store for its other occupants, preserving 
all the qualities of modularity and comfort of the original 3008.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They can enjoy the passenger compartment and its original ambience, bathed 
in the light diffused by the immense panoramic glass roof. They also benefit 
from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous 
centre console at the front.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another feature retained for the front passenger: the large grab handle on 
the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable 
journey.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Thanks to its intelligent <em>Multiflex </em>interior and clever 
integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 HYbrid4 
can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel 
shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 VDA), with 66 litres (29 dm3 VDA) consisting of 
storage under the boot floor. This ingenious compartment also allows storage of 
the load space cover.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor 
equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength. 
From the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on 
the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded 
automatically, as if by magic.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 HYbrid4 offers a 
perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel. This frees up a 
gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Inside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected 
possibilities.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>DRIVING AIDS: HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY AND DRIVING ENJOYMENT 
</strong></p> 
<p>Comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the 
equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the 
road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is 
projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the 
instrument panel visor. This<em>Head- Up Display </em>system can be adjusted by 
means of<em>Toggle Switches</em>. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These switches, located above the centre console, add a further touch of 
style to the in-car ambience.</p> 
<p>Similarly, the electric parking brake (FSE) coupled with the <em>Hill Assist
</em>function, facilitates the driver&rsquo;s manoeuvres and optimises space in 
place of the manual hand brake.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Lastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide 
users on their travels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>WIPCom 3D </em>includes all the benefits of the Marque&rsquo;s existing 
satellite navigation systems.</p> 
<p><br>
 These include the <em>Jukebox </em>function, linked to the presence 
of a hard disc, the GSM function, a USB connector, a DVD player, the<em>
Bluetooth&reg;</em>system and also a graphic interface which shows city 
buildings in &ldquo;full 3D&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><em>Peugeot Connect </em>services offered with <em>WIPCom 3D </em>will also 
be accessible.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the final analysis, the 3008 HYbrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional 
technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled 
driving pleasure and CO2 emissions of a very low level. Peugeot&rsquo;s choice 
of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising 
environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a 
hybrid vehicle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The hybrid rear section of the 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in Sochaux and 
in Mulhouse. It is expected to go on sale in Europe in the spring of 2011.</p>
