<h1>Eco-friendly trains with hybrid energy storage</h1> <br>
<br>

<p> Researchers are investigating how to make diesel-powered trains more 
eco-friendly. One way is to implement a hybrid energy storage system that both 
could lower fuel consumption up to 13 percent and reduce harmful idling 
emissions<em>(Oct '11)</em></p>  Related Articles A new supercapacitor to

Progress in the development of rechargeable batteries through nanotechnology 
<br> 
<p> Hydro-mechanical diesel multiple units (DMUs), multiple unit trains 
powered by diesel engines, are needed in regional traffic. At the Institute of 
Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart, Germany, researchers have developed a<strong>new 
hybrid hydro-mechanical DMU concept</strong>, including a <strong>hybrid energy 
storage system</strong>made up of batteries and double layer capacitors. The 
hybrid energy storage system fits the requirements better in comparison with 
double layer capacitor or battery energy storage systems.</p> 
<p> The main advantage of batteries is that they can <strong>store more energy 
</strong>than double layer capacitors, but their power is more expensive and 
they only last for up to 5000 duty cycles. On the other hand, double layer 
capacitors can give up to one million duty cycles. Another advantage of double 
layer capacitors is high power density, while the disadvantage is limited 
energy density which makes high energy applications very expensive.</p> 
<p> To evaluate both the <strong>electrical</strong> and<strong> thermal 
behaviour</strong>of the hybrid energy storage system, the researchers built up 
a scaled energy storage in hardware on a test bench and used a DMU model to 
simulate train environment and drive train. The test bench makes it possible to 
validate models. The researchers measured the double layer capacitor and the 
battery currents and voltages. When they compared these values with simulated 
values a good agreement was seen. However, they also found that a suitable 
cooling concept of the hybrid energy storages has to be developed, as well as a 
dependable method to determine the storages&rsquo; state of charge while in 
operation.</p> 
<p> This hybrid energy storage system connected to the DMU propulsion system 
was tested for fuel consumption and performance and compared with a 
conventional DMU. Depending on the characteristics of tracks and parameters 
such as station distance and maximum speed, simulations suggested fuel savings 
from 6 to 13 percent, which makes the<strong>CO2 emissions decrease </strong>by 
the same percentage. Reduced pollutant emissions and noise at stations can also 
achieved through the new concept, since it makes it possible to turn off the 
diesel engine during stops and use stored energy to power auxiliary systems.</p>
<p> This new hybrid hydro-mechanical DMU concept has a long way to go before 
being widely employed on tracks. However, fuel savings between 6 and 13 percent 
would be an important step towards decreasing the CO2 emissions from 
diesel-powered trains.<br>
