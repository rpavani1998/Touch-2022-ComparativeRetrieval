<h1>Hybrid cars</h1> 
<p>Hybrid cars combine a conventional petrol engine with an electric motor. 
This enables them to deliver improved fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide 
emissions. Most can run in electric-only mode, which means zero-emissions. This 
is particularly beneficial in cities and during stop-start driving at 
low-speeds.</p> 
<p><strong>How do they work?</strong><br>
Hybrid cars use both a petrol engine 
and electric motors, and the energy used by the electric motors is stored in 
rechargeable batteries. The car has a computer system which decides which 
energy source to use at different times, based on maximizing efficiency.</p> 
<p>However, a Channel 4 study of hybrid vehicles explains there are different 
hybrid systems, which use different combinations of energy sources.</p> 
<p>The study says, 'The Honda Insight, for example, will use the petrol engine 
only when moving off from rest and at low speeds, but when accelerating, its 
computer asks the electric motor to chip in with extra help. As cruising speeds 
are reached, the electric motor is turned off, leaving petrol power only. As 
the driver starts to slow down &ndash; and this is the clever bit &ndash; the 
electric motor becomes a generator and transfers the kinetic energy of the car 
into the battery as electric power.</p> 
<p>'This is called 'regenerative braking'. Whenever the car comes to a stop, 
the computer turns off the engine to save fuel and CO2 emissions.'</p> 
<p><strong>How green is your car?</strong><br>
 Electric and hybrid cars are 
in the Department for Transport&rsquo;s A or B rating bands &ndash; the tops 
bands &ndash; for being the most environmentally friendly of today&rsquo;s 
cars. This means their CO2 emissions are below 100g/km (Band A) or between 101 
and 120g/km (Band B). The rating guide runs from A through to G.</p> 
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong><br>
 Some of the disadvantages of using a 
hybrid car include the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>  They can be expensive to buy compared with conventional cars </li> 
<li>  Hybrids are not as cost-efficient for people doing mainly motorway 
mileage </li> 
<li>  Driving in cities can sap the batteries, which means the petrol engine 
has to take over </li> 
<li>  Boot space can be limited as space is taken by the electric power-train 
and batteries </li> 
<li>  Battery toxicity is a concern, though today's hybrids use recyclable 
NiMH batteries, not NiCad </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Counting the cost</strong><br>
 Hybrid cars are popular, and are 
therefore holding their resale values at present. But, theChannel 4 study says, 
'Overall, given the high purchase costs compared to a mainstream car, a 
comparable diesel-engine model is often cheaper to run &ndash; and emits less 
carbon dioxide.'</p> 
<p>When it comes to maintenance, a hybrid doesn't tend to cost any more than a 
conventional car, but dealer service centres can charge a little more for 
servicing hybrid cars. That said, experts say that it may cost less to maintain 
a hybrid car, compared with petrol or diesel, due to decreased wear and tear on 
the engine and braking system.</p> 
<p>In addition, hybrid battery packs are designed to last for the lifetime of 
the vehicle, which is somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 miles. This can 
help to reduce running costs over the life of the car. They can also attract 
lower<strong>tax</strong> bandings than petrol counterparts, and are usually 
exempt from schemes such as London's congestion charge.</p> 
<p><strong>The future</strong><br>
 Hydrogen fuel cell technology is on the 
horizon and could eventually offer a greener alternative to today&rsquo;s 
hybrid car. However, most experts agree that cars powered by hydrogen will not 
arrive for another 10 to 20 years. Plus, the first hydrogen-powered cars are 
likely to use more than one energy source, so they&rsquo;ll be considered 
hybrid cars too.</p>
