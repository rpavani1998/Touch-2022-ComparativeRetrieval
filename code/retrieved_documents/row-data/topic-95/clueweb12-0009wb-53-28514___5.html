<h2>Cruise Green</h2> 
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid has redefined the profile of vessels on the San 
Francisco Bay. As the nation's first hybrid ferry, this boats mission is far 
more important than its appearance. It's called a hybrid because it uses energy 
from solar, wind, grid electric, and Tier 2 diesel generators to power the 
vessel.</p> 
<p>When the solar panels on top of the vessel absorb sunlight and energy is 
generated by the wind turbines, power is provided to charge 380 V DC batteries. 
Additional power is provided by the diesel generator for more efficient 
movement through the water. The vessel can operate on propulsion batteries 
alone for over an hour providing a silent cruise around the bay. The Hornblower 
Hybrid is leading the way in environmentally friendly vessels and the potential 
to decrease our daily carbon foot print.</p> 
<h2>Charter the Hornblower Hybrid</h2> 
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid, our environmental flagship, serves many purposes for 
Alcatraz Cruises. Ferrying visitors from all over to world to Alcatraz and 
Angel Island, the hybrid is also host to private charters and events. The 
Hornblower Hybrid has five distinct areas for buffet and cocktail setup and 
also allows for optimal viewing and mingling opportunities. This provides you 
with flexibility to meet your event and group needs. With a maximum capacity of 
149 passengers for ferry service and up to 110 guests for a cocktail party, the 
Hornblower Hybrid is ideal for any environmentally friendly event.</p>

<h2>Discover The Bay!</h2> 
<p>Join Aquarium of the Bay and Alcatraz Cruises for a unique, hands-on 
educational experience. Our new Discover the Bay program combines the 
experience of learning about San Francisco Bay onboard the Hornblower Hybrid, 
the nation&rsquo;s first hybrid ferry, with a guided tour of Aquarium of the 
Bay&rsquo;s exhibits with more than 20,000 local marine animals. Lead by the 
Aquarium&rsquo;s team of expert naturalists, this experience provides an 
immersive learning experience with San Francisco Bay from above and below the 
water.</p> 
<p>During this 5 hour program, your students will learn about the ecology of 
San Francisco Bay, the history of these waters and the surrounding Golden Gate 
National Recreation Area, impacts of climate change to this region, innovative 
energy saving technologies, and personal actions everyone can do to protect 
this vital resource. The Discover the Bay program is aligned with California 
State Science Standards for 6th grade &ndash; and is appropriate for students 
in 5th through 8th grade. Alcatraz Cruises is pleased to partner with Aquarium 
of the Bay, a local non-profit dedicated to creating experiences that inspire 
conservation of San Francisco Bay and its watershed.</p>

<h2>Energy and Fuel Savings</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>We built the Hornblower Hybrid by reusing another boat. In doing so, we 
saved more than 735,000 KWh of electricity in the construction and retrofit of 
the vessel. That is the equivalent of taking more than 60 U.S. homes off the 
grid for an entire year!</li> 
<li>Instead of idling at the dock or burning diesel to keep the lights on (a 
standard practice in the industry) the Hornblower Hybrid switches from diesel 
power to battery mode to save fuel and reduce emissions.</li> 
<li>The Hornblower Hybrid will reduce our annual diesel consumption by more 
than 29,000 gallons! That is equivalent to taking 58 cars off the road 
permanently or planting 90 acres of trees.</li> 
<li>The hybrid boat uses approximately six gallons of diesel fuel per hour, 
compared to 30 gallons per hour used by a conventional ferryboat.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Green Interior</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Carpet - contains Everset Fibers made from post-consumer recycled 
materials and is also recyclable.</li> 
<li>Countertops &ndash; indoor and outdoor bars are made from pieces of 
recycled glass by Vetrazzo, Inc.</li> 
<li>Lights - the boat is fully equipped with an LED lighting system. All LED 
lights onboard are equivalent to one 100-Watt incandescent light bulb.</li> 
<li>Interior signage - printed on Plyboo, a sustainably-sourced composite 
containing no harmful chemicals or materials.</li> 
<li>All interior modifications meet the United States Green Building Council's 
LEED criteria for recycled content.</li> </ul>
