<h3>The Power of Batteries</h3> 
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid&nbsp;i
s&nbsp;a&nbsp;technological&nbsp;advancement&nbsp;many years in the making, 
harnessing energy from the sun and the wind, combined with diesel engines, to 
propel the vessel. And although most of our visitors are excited about the wind 
and solar technology, we don't want our guests to forget about another 
important technology component: Battery Power!</p>
<p>To give a quick review, power from the wind turbines and solar panels are 
stored in the battery banks that power navigation tools, lighting and other 
electronic needs. &nbsp;Any excess power is stored in the main propulsion 
battery banks that allow for zero emissions mode. &nbsp;Without the battery 
banks, the&nbsp;Hornblower Hybrid would have nowhere to store power!</p> 
<p>To remind our devoted blog readers about the power of batteries, our team 
of engineers have compiled some fun facts about the batteries on the Hornblower 
Hybrid:</p> 
<p> &bull; There is approximately 2,300 pounds of batteries&nbsp;in each of 
the two boat hulls, totaling&nbsp;4,600 pounds&nbsp;of batteries!</p> 
<p>&bull; Each battery bank holds 380 volts.</p> 
<p>&bull; It would take around 15,000 AA style&nbsp;batteries to&nbsp;equal 
the battery banks on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Hornblower Hybrid.</p> 
<p> &bull; It takes approximately 5 hours to recharge the</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; batteries.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> &bull; The boat has a battery pack about 17 times as</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; large as the one found in the Prius.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> &bull; The Hornblower Hybrid can do up to 7 knots on</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; battery power. &nbsp;(A knot is 1.15 mph).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just a reminder, we recycle batteries on Alcatraz Landing in San Francisco. 
&nbsp;So if your camera runs out of batteries after an all day photo shoot on 
Alcatraz Island, please feel free to drop them off with any Alcatraz Cruises 
staff member and we will dispose of them properly.</p>

<h3>Growing Trend: Vehicle-Fleet Hybrid Retrofits</h3> 
<p></p>
<p></p><br>

<p>Recently we wrote about the advantages of recycling and reusing a diving 
vessel for the Hornblower Hybrid and discussed the environmental benefits of 
retrofitting a used boat. On top of saving energy, another long term goal was 
to ignite a trend towards hybrid retrofits in the water transportation industry.
<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the meantime, hybrid retrofits have become a budding trend in the land 
transportation industry, with Fed Ex increasing its North American hybrid truck 
fleet by 50 percent after last week's announcement of 92 additional retrofitted 
delivery trucks. Fed Ex claims to have the largest hybrid package delivery 
fleet in the U.S. with a total of 264 hybrid trucks. The repurposed vehicles 
are 44 percent more fuel efficient than standard FedEx delivery trucks and 
produce 96 percent fewer particulates and 75 percent fewer smog-causing 
emissions.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. is also looking toward a future in hybrid 
retrofits. &nbsp;PG&amp;E was one of 14 utility companies to asses a hybrid 
diesel-electric truck in it's vehicle fleet, which could potentially cut fuel 
consumption by 30 to 60 percent.<br>
</p>
<p>If we are moving toward a future of hybrid vehicle fleets, the logical next 
step would be hybrid vessel fleets.&nbsp;The technologies used on the 
Hornblower Hybrid are not limited to just this vessel or the current route it 
operates to Alcatraz and Angel Island in San Francisco. &nbsp;It can be used on 
almost any vessel, even a fleet of vessels! Our company was just the first to 
hire an engineering team to design and integrate the systems, making it the 
first successful implementation of a hybrid&nbsp;passenger&nbsp;ferry in the 
United States. &nbsp;We can offer our services to other vessel operators who 
would like a hybrid vessel(s) as well.</p>

<h3>Hornblower Hybrid vs. Toyota Prius</h3> <br>
<br>

<p>The Hornblower Hybrid has often been referred to as &quot;a Prius 
on&nbsp;steroids&quot; and when asked to explain the functions of our hybrid 
vessel, our team often refers to the capabilities of the Toyota Prius as an 
easy explanation. &nbsp;So how do these two hybrid vehicles compare?</p> 
<p>Similarities<br>
</p>
<p>Like the Prius, that can be propelled by gasoline (petrol) and/or electric 
power, the Hornblower Hybrid is a diesel-electric vessel that also switches 
between these two modes of power. &nbsp;Accessories such as dashboard lights 
and air conditioning on the Toyota Prius, are powered by the battery pack just 
like the Hornblower Hybrid that uses power stored in its battery banks to power 
navigation tools, lighting and other electronic needs. &nbsp;Another</p>
<p>similarity is the display screens onboard the Hornblower Hybrid that show 
energy flow&nbsp;to/from the engines and battery bank as well as the battery 
charge level. &nbsp;The Prius also has an energy monitor on its multi-function 
dashboard display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Differences<br>
</p>
<p>The main difference between the two hybrid vehicles is the Hornblower 
Hybrid's customized drive system that lets the captain monitor the vessel's 
energy needs and choose the most efficient power sources. For example, when the 
boat is idling at the dock, the engines are shut off and the electric motors 
run simply off the energy stored in the battery banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Toyota Prius instead makes that choice for the driver, automatically 
switching from gasoline engine to electric mode, for example, when idling at a 
stoplight or driving at low speeds. &nbsp;We are not making any claims that the 
Hornblower Hybrid technology is better than Toyota, just different, in that one 
technology lets you choose between the two modes and the other makes the choice 
or you.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>When comparing the Hornblower Hybrid and the Toyota Prius, the most 
important comparison to make is their fuel efficiency. &nbsp;Compared to a 
typical ferry boat that burns 25 to 30 gallons of diesel per hour, the 
Hornblower Hybrid uses between 5 to 7 gallons per hour. The 2010 Prius can 
reach up to 51 mpg compared to a typical compact vehicle that can get 30-40 
mpg. &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Like the Toyota Prius, that led the way for more fuel-efficient cars, we 
hope the Hornblower Hybrid will spark change in the maritime industry for more 
fuel-efficient boats in the future.</p>

<h3>Peddle Power! How Many Bikes Would it Take to Power the Hornblower Hybrid?
</h3> 
<p> <br>
<br>
During the construction of the vessel, the Hornblower Hybrid 
team saw the opportunity to make the new hybrid ferry an educational tool and 
seized it, adding many learning components throughout the boat. &nbsp;The 
Hornblower Hybrid comes equipped with many educational tools onboard including 
a large display of diagrams and educational photos in the pilothouse. Signs are 
also posted throughout the vessel with information on the &quot;green&quot; 
components of the boat, including countertops made of recycled glass to show 
passengers firsthand how materials can be reused to reduce our impact on the 
planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the boat's most popular education tools, however, is an exercise 
bike that is hooked up to a miniature, functioning representation of the same 
system that directs solar and wind turbine power to the battery pack. 
&nbsp;Passengers can peddle the bike and actually generate power for the 
Hornblower Hybrid's batteries. Designed with children in mind to learn how much 
energy it takes to generate power, the bike has become more popular with adults 
who are not shy about giving a few elbows to get their turn at peddling.&nbsp;
<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>So how much man power would it actually take to generate enough energy to 
power the boat? According to our project engineer, we would need 1,500 bikes 
onboard to power the Hornblower Hybrid at 10 knots. That's a lot of bikes! 
&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>We hope this makes our guests think more about the energy they use at home 
and encourages them to make environmentally friendly decisions in their daily 
lives. &nbsp;That being said, make sure to come in your best shape, get ready 
to peddle and we will see you onboard!*<br>
</p>
<p>* You can join us on the Hornblower Hybrid by purchasing tickets for our 
Island Hop tour to Alcatraz and Angel Island. &nbsp;Tickets can be purchased at

<h3>Recycled Glass Countertops Made From 2,000 Bottles of Vodka</h3> 
<p> You host a party, your friends show up, you serve vodka&nbsp;martinis, you 
dance, you mingle, say good-bye, clean up the mess and recycle the empty 
bottles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this is how countertops are made in&nbsp;the 
&ldquo;green&rdquo; world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You heard right. &nbsp;As part of our dedication to Respect Our Planet, all 
countertops on the Hornblower Hybrid are made from recycled glass &ndash; two 
thousand Skyy Vodka bottles to be more exact. Vetrazzo, Inc., a certified Bay 
Area Green Business, created and designed all countertops onboard the vessel 
made from approximately 85% post-consumer recycled glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like Hornblower and companies, Vetrazzo cultivates a workplace that 
demonstrates a respect for people and the planet and we are proud to partner 
with local green businesses that share our mission for a cleaner and greener 
environment. </p>
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid is &ldquo;green&rdquo; in many other ways beyond its 
clean energy capabilities and recycled glass countertops. The vessel includes 
other environmentally friendly components such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Carpet:&nbsp;contains Everset Fibers,&nbsp;made from&nbsp;post 
consumer recycled materials and is recyclable.</p>
<p>- Lights:&nbsp;the boat is fully equipped with an LED lighting system&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Interior Signage:&nbsp;printed on Plyboo (left), 100% renewable plywood 
bamboo made from sustainable sources</p>

<h3>Save Energy and the Planet: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!</h3> 
<p><br>
<br>
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - some may call these the &quot;3 
R's&quot; but our team at Hornblower refers to these three words as important 
guidelines to build a hybrid ferry.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>In 2005, Hornblower Cruises &amp; Events was awarded a 10-year contract to 
provide transportation across the San Francisco Bay to Alcatraz Island. The 
National Park Service contract stipulated that our fleet include ferries that 
were built or refitted to a higher level of environmental standards. Not only 
did our company accept the challenge, but our team of engineers went above and 
beyond.&nbsp;After refitting two existing vessels with new engines that reduce 
emissions by 50% and comply to Tier 2 standards, Hornblower has taken the next 
step by introducing a hybrid ferry to to its &quot;green&quot; fleet.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid, now complete and in full time service to Alcatraz 
and Angel Island, not only reduces emissions during operation but also saved 
energy during vessel construction.&nbsp; Instead of starting from scratch, 
Hornblower acquired an aluminum commercial dive boat to convert into a hybrid 
ferry. The retrofit, repower and refurbishment took several months to complete 
and almost 90 percent of the former dive boat was refitted.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>By&nbsp;Reusing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Recycling&nbsp;a used diving vessel, 
Hornblower saved 735,000 KWh of electricity in the construction/retrofit of the 
vessel. That is equivalent to taking more than 60 U.S. homes off the grid for 
one year,&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;Reducing&nbsp;our environmental impact.&nbsp;

<h3>A Special Earth Day on the Bay</h3> 
<p><br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Mother Earth: We take her for granted daily, even though she does just 
about everything for us. &nbsp;So on Earth Day many green-minded people made 
plans to show a little love, and to do our part, Alcatraz Cruises offered a way 
for people to learn about living on this planet with a softer footprint. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Earth Day is celebrated every year on April 22nd and is designed to inspire 
awareness and appreciation for the Earth's environment. &nbsp;Appropriately, 
the Hornblower Hybrid is designed to inspire environmental awareness as well 
and to teach our guests about the importance of environmental stewardship. 
&nbsp;Therefore Alcatraz Cruises extended the invitation to come onboard the 
Hornblower Hybrid for a special Earth Day Cruise around the San Francisco 
Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Tickets were sold for three special Earth Day Cruises with 100% of the 
proceeds donated to Save the Bay, an organization dedicated to protecting, 
restoring and celebrating the San Francisco Bay. &nbsp;Representatives from 
Save the Bay were present to educate all Earth Day cruisers about the 
importance of habitat restoration for a healthy bay.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>The event was a great success, enjoyed by green enthusiasts, families, 
students and cruisers who were just looking to enjoy a sunny day on the 
beautiful San Francisco Bay. &nbsp;We look forward to making our Earth Day 
Cruise onboard the Hornblower Hybrid an annual event, and look forward to 
seeing you next year!</p>

<h3>Introducing the Hornblower Hybrid</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>A new hybrid vehicle is in town and this one has no wheels. Alcatraz 
Cruises, an affiliate of Hornblower Cruises and Events, is pleased to introduce 
to its fleet the Hornblower Hybrid, a wind, solar and diesel powered hybrid 
boat.&nbsp; This environmentally progressive vessel showcases the potential 
power of alternative energy sources when they are combined with creative 
engineering solutions.</p> 
<p>Part of Respect Our Planet&rsquo;s mission is to educate our guests and 
increase their environmental awareness. The Hornblower Hybrid is a visual 
platform from which visitors can learn first-hand the capabilities of solar 
power, wind power and other hybrid technological advancements.</p> 
<p>For those of you who do not own a Toyota Prius, a hybrid vessel typically 
uses two or more distinct power sources and a combination of a diesel engine 
(in our case, Tier 2 marine diesel engines) with one or more electric motors.
</p> 
<p>For those of you who are interested in hybrid technology, the 64-foot 
hybrid is the largest of any hybrid ferryboat in the world, making it a 
prototype that others in the ferry transportation industry can follow.&nbsp; 
The Hornblower Hybrid uses two ten-foot-tall 1,500-Watt wind turbines and a 1.5 
KW solar array to power all house loads. &nbsp;The 400hp electric motors are 
powered by a 320 KW generator and a 380 V battery pack that supplements the 
clean Tier 2 marine diesel engines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Combining these technologies we are able to greatly reduce our fuel 
consumption and overall emissions.&nbsp; Annual fuel savings of the Hornblower 
Hybrid will be upwards of 29,000 gallons! &nbsp;That is equivalent to taking 58 
cars off the road permanently or planting 90 acres of trees.&nbsp; The hybrid 
boat uses approximately six gallons of diesel fuel per hour, compared to 30 
gallons per hour used by a conventional ferryboat.</p> 
<p>The hybrid boat is equipped with a customized drive system that allows the 
captain to monitor the energy needs of the boat and select the most efficient 
power sources.&nbsp; Instead of&nbsp;idling at the dock or burning diesel to 
keep the lights on, the hybrid will switch between diesel mode and battery mode 
in order to save fuel and reduce emissions. &nbsp; </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Hornblower Hybrid will be a multi-purpose vessel within the Alcatraz 
Cruises fleet and will be taking school groups on educational cruises around 
the bay. It will also be available for private events.&nbsp; Charter and other 
information are available atwww.alcatrazcruises.com/hybrid.</p> <br>
