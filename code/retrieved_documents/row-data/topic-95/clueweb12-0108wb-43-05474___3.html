<h2>Detroit Diesel Continues Innovation and Environmental Leadership with 
Diesel Particulate Filter Cleaning and Recycling</h2> 5/13/2009 <br>
 REDFORD, 
Mich. Remanufacturing is the ultimate form of recycling and Detroit Diesel has 
been a leading remanufacturing company for years. Detroit Diesel continues its 
remanufacturing leadership with its pioneering and environmentally-friendly 
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) cleaning process. This proprietary process was 
designed to recycle used DPFs and save customers downtime with its 
groundbreaking exchange program.<br>
<br>
As customers with EPA07 equipment 
begin to approach the required DPF change intervals, they can rest assured that 
switching their DPF using Detroit Diesel&rsquo;s process will mean minimal 
downtime. Detroit Diesel service outlets are stocked with DPFs for a quick 
exchange. After the exchange is used, DPFs are shipped to Detroit Diesel 
Remanufacturing where they undergo an exclusive cleaning process.<br>
<br>
When 
the EPA07 emissions standard launched more than two years ago, the engineers at 
Detroit Diesel Remanufacturing knew they had an opportunity to help customers 
save money by designing an innovative DPF cleaning technology. The result was a 
de-ionized water technology that restores DPFs to approximately 95 percent of 
their original effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Detroit Diesel&rsquo;s technology is the 
industry benchmark for effectiveness, meaning customers will get longer life 
from their reliabilt&reg; DPF and the convenience of a quick exchange program. 
Since launching its DPF cleaning program, the company has recycled more than 
7,000 filters.<br>
<br>
Not only is the Detroit Diesel remanufactured DPF 
restored to almost-new, it saves our customers money because the remanufactured 
DPF is more cost effective than a new part,&rdquo; said Richard Marcis, manager 
of reliabilt&reg; product engineering for Detroit Diesel. &ldquo;Detroit Diesel 
is committed to providing economical, environmentally friendly solutions at the 
highest level of quality.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With more than 800 locations in North 
America, Detroit Diesel&rsquo;s trained and qualified technicians are ready to 
assist customers with their DPF exchanges.<br>
<br>

www.detroitdiesel.com/supportnetwork to find a nearby location stocked not only 
with DPFs, but genuine Detroit Diesel parts, maintenance products and reliabilt 
remanufactured components.<br>
