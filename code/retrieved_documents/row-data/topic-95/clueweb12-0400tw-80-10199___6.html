<p>The state of California recently announced plans to offer owners of new 
low-emission Chevrolet Volts a US$1,500 tax credit on top of the US$7,500 
rebate already given to those who buy the electric vehicle.</p> 
<p>The cherry on top? Lawmakers decided to let owners of the new Volt drive it 
solo in California's carpool lanes.</p> 
<p>It was just the latest example of how governments across North America have 
been pushing consumers toward electric and hybrid vehicles and off fossil fuels.
</p> 
<p>But to little effect. In Canada last year, hybrid and electric vehicles 
amounted to just 1.5% of the total vehicles sold, with sales weighed down by 
consumer anxiety around the technology and price. A recent KPMG study forecast 
that electrified vehicles were unlikely to make up more than 15% of the overall 
market in North American until at least 2025.</p> 
<p>This has automakers searching for more consumer-friendly alternatives as 
they struggle to meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards set in 
the U.S. and elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Oddly enough, that has brought companies like electricity booster General 
Motors Co. back to diesels in their efforts to curb emissions.</p> 
<p>GM said this week it would bring a diesel variation of its popular compact 
car, the Cruze, to North America next year. It is perhaps the best sign that 
diesels are entering the mainstream on this continent.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's all centred around fuel economy,&quot; says Matt Crossley, GM 
Canada's director of engineering. &quot;Hybridization and electrification is 
part of it.</p> 
<p>&quot;Diesel is part of it. There's probably going to be other fuels in 
here, like natural gas, that are likely going to be a part of it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Diesel engines have, however, presented themselves as one of the more 
proven technologies in the marketplace. They have long made up nearly half of 
the market in Europe and elsewhere.</p> 
<p>But their legacy of being loud, sulphur-spewing beasts clogging North 
American highways has been something that has weighed on sales here. As a 
result, the market for diesel engines in North America has been primarily 
reserved for trucks because of their better torque, and to European imports.</p>
<p>But major technological advancements over the past few decades, as well as 
new regulations on the fuel that fires them here, has breathed new life into 
the diesel market in North America.</p> 
<p>&quot;The modern diesels are just fabulous engines,&quot; says David Cole 
of the Center for Automotive Research. &quot;A lot of the historic problems of 
noise and smell are pretty much gone, and diesel fuel is more widely 
available.&quot;</p> 
<p>The value proposition is clear: Diesel engines offer similar fuel savings 
to hybrids at a lower cost and without the anxiety attached to a new 
technology. As Sergio Marchionne, Chrysler chief executive, put it at the 
Detroit Auto Show this year: &quot;We think that the market is ready to listen 
to a diesel story.&quot;</p> 
<p>Chrysler will also be bringing a diesel version of its Grand Cherokee to 
market in the second quarter of 2013.</p> 
<p>It's not just the U.S. automakers joining the party.</p> 
<p>Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. also plans to introduce diesel variations of 
several of its popular vehicles next year in North America, although it has yet 
to officially say which models.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's part of our environmental strategy. A lot of other manufacturers 
are looking at hybrids and electric vehicles,&quot; says Sandra Lemaitre, Mazda 
Canada spokeswoman. &quot;We're introducing diesel to bring down the average 
fuel economy for our vehicle fleet.&quot;</p> 
<p>Diesel engines on average offer about 25% greater fuel efficiency than a 
traditional combustion engine, or roughly the same amount as a hybrid, says 
George Magliano, IHS Global Insight analyst. But the extra value comes in the 
selling price. The average diesel-powered vehicle will cost about $2,000 more 
than a traditional internal-combustion engine, while a hybrid variation might 
cost upward of $7,000 more, depending on the make and model, he says.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think the bloom is off the rose on electrification a little bit and 
people are looking at the traditional internal combustion engine and the diesel 
engine as a way of hitting those fuel-economy standards,&quot; he says. 
&quot;Diesel used to be 'd' for 'dirty.' That's not the case anymore.&quot;</p> 
<p>But Mr. Magliano says there would have to be more options in the North 
America marketplace before consumers, in particular in the U.S., really buy 
into diesel.</p> 
<p>Diesel sales accounted for about 1% of total U.S. sales in 2011, while the 
hybrid market was more than double that.</p> 
<p>The opposite is true, however, in Canada, where consumers are more 
efficiency oriented. Diesel sales made up about 3% of sales in Canada last 
year, compared to about 1.5% for hybrid and all-electric vehicles, says Dennis 
DesRosiers, a leading auto analyst in the country.</p> 
<p>Mr. DesRosiers says he believes the somewhat tepid response to electric and 
hybrid vehicles in Canada is a result of the compromises consumers have to make 
in order to drive them.</p> 
<p>&quot;It might be size, handling, power, trunk space, design or other 
things, and at the same time pay a lot more,&quot; he says. &quot;With diesel, 
you also pay more, but you do not have to compromise.&quot;</p> 
<p>Josh Bailey, vice-president of research at Canadian Black Book, said diesel 
engines also carry the added advantage of a higher resale value.</p> 
<p>For example, the diesel option on the older Grand Cherokee that went out of 
production in 2008 cost consumers roughly $6,000 extra. But the resale value of 
the diesel Grand Cherokee commands up to a $10,000 premium in the secondary 
market relative to the traditional gasoline version, he said.</p> 
<p>With the fuel savings and higher resale value, buyers of new diesel-powered 
cars can find themselves with an extra couple of thousand dollars in their 
pocket after just a few years.</p> 
<p>At the same time, hybrids in the used market seldom come close to making up 
the original amount paid, he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;It speaks volumes about what people want to buy,&quot; Mr. Bailey 
says. &quot;Where diesels are offered, we definitely see that it commands a 
premium [in the used market] over the gas variant, and often times, it is a 
premium over what the feature originally sold for.&quot;</p> 
<p>It is perhaps not surprising then that Peter Hatges, a partner at KPMG LLP 
and leader of its automotive group, expects the uptake in diesel engines to 
greatly outpace hybrids in the coming years.</p> 
<p>He says he expects diesel sales to make up about 15% of the market in 
Canada within the next eight years, while it will likely be at least 15 years 
before hybrids and electrics hit that point.</p> 
<p>Part of the discrepancy is that the diesel engine is a proven technology, 
whereas there is still a lot anxiety about electrified vehicles' batteries, 
which can cost upward of $10,000 each.</p> 
<p>&quot;Diesel technology is not new. It's new to North America in the sense 
that it has been improved so much.- the engines themselves are very 
robust,&quot; Mr. Hatges says.</p> 
<p>Volkswagen estimates that about 40% of its Canadian customers will choose a 
diesel variation when given the choice between it and a traditional gasoline 
engine. The gap narrows substantially in higher-end vehicles, where the $2,000 
premium is negligible.</p> 
<p>Mercedes-Benz estimates that between 75% and 85% of its customers will 
choose diesel when given both options.</p> 
<p>But Thomas Tetzlaff, VW Canada spokesman, notes that diesel sales are made 
without the aid of government subsidies. About 30% of VW's overall sales in 
Canada are diesel engines compared to 50% in Europe, where consumers are 
rewarded for driving more efficient vehicles of all types through the tax 
regime there.</p> 
<p>In North America the push has been primarily focused on rewarding consumers 
of electric or hybrid vehicles, he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;In Europe, there is very significant government support of diesel 
cars,&quot; he said. &quot;If the government wants to make efficiency part of 
the course of day-to-day business activity and part of the buyer's decision, 
well then, efficiency of any sort should be rewarded.&quot;</p>
