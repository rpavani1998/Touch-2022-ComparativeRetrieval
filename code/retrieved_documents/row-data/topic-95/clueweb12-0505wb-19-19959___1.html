<h1> Volvo unveils world's first diesel plug-in hybrid </h1> 
<p>Volvo will be unveiling what it claims is the world's first diesel plug in 
hybrid.<br>
<br>
The hybrid offers carbon dioxide emissions below 50 g/km, 
Volvo claims, and will be launched in the market in 2012.<br>
<br>
The Plug-in 
Hybrid is the result of close co-operation between Volvo Cars and Swedish 
energy supplier Vattenfall.<br>
<br>
The car, which is a modified Volvo V60, 
features a range of up to 32 miles, 215 + 70 horsepower, 440 + 200 Nm of torque 
and acceleration from 0 to 62 mph of just 6.9 seconds.<br>
<br>
Stefan Jacoby, 
President and CEO of Volvo Cars said: &quot;The technology is still undergoing 
development and testing, however, the car already points very clearly to what 
our customers can expect when the plug-in hybrid enters showrooms next 
year.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What we've done is to spice it up with spearhead 
technology that allows the driver to choose: zero emissions, high-efficiency 
hybrid or full-on performance.&quot;<br>
