Diesel Hybrid 
Electric Cars Now! Jamais Cascio, 3 Jun 04 <br>

<p>How come nobody sells a hybrid diesel car?</p> 
<p>For those of you familiar only with the sooty smoke belching from older 
big-rig trucks or the foul smells from 1970s diesel cars, the question may come 
as a surprise. But modern diesel engine design coupled with the much-cleaner 
types of diesel fuel increasingly available (particularly 
&quot;biodiesel&quot;) make diesel vehicles a surprisingly 
environmentally-friendly choice. Diesel-hybrid-electrics would be an obvious 
positive development. So why don't we see them?</p> 
<p>I suppose the answer varies depending upon where you are. In the US, the 
diesel fuel available in most locations remains the old, dirty, high-sulfur 
variety, so a hybrid diesel actually wouldn't be a significant improvement in 
emissions; once low-sulfur regulations take effect in 2006, this may change. In 
Europe, where advanced-technology &quot;clean&quot; diesel autos are one-third 
to one-half of the auto market and growing, some diesel cars already get 
mileage roughly equivalent to hybrids, so I suspect there's simply less demand.
</p> 
<p>The irony is that diesel hybrids could be far more efficient and clean than 
anything now on the market, without any leaps in technology. The combination of
modern clean diesel engines, Prius-style serial hybrid-electric systems, and 
biodiesel/vegetable oil fuels could provide amazing mileage, cleaner air, and 
vastly reduced petroleum dependency. Comfortable, powerful sedans could get 
upwards of 80 miles per gallon<i>and</i> be carbon-neutral.</p> 
<p>(More in the extended entry...)</p> 
<p>It's certainly not that diesel hybrids are somehow impossible. 
Diesel-electric hybrid buses are available and have been rolled out in (among 
other places)Seattle, Washington and Apeldoorn, in the Netherlands. As for 
autos, Ford, GM, and Daimler-Chryslereach built prototype diesel hybrids a few 
years ago which got mileage in the 70-80 mpg range. But the automakers opted 
not to produce them, as the cars couldn't meet strict air pollution rules while 
running on the sulfur-laden American diesel.</p> 
<p>Combining the power of diesel engines with the efficiency of hybrid 
technologies can have terrific payoffs. Last year, MIT'sLaboratory for Energy 
and the Environment produced a study (PDF) comparing total lifecycle energy 
efficiency and greenhouse emissions (including use, production, fuel 
production, and eventual disposal) of idealized advanced internal combustion, 
hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. Diesel hybrids turned out to be much better 
than gasoline/gasoline-hybrid cars, and highly competitive with the best 
hydrogen fuel cell systems (even assuming optimistic fuel cell vehicle 
development). But the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will require entirely 
new hydrogen production, storage, and fueling facilities; reformed-gasoline 
fuel cells (which are more likely to be used, as they would not require the 
wholesale replacement of fueling stations) fared much worse.</p> 
<p>It's particularly notable that the results in the MIT study were based on 
the assumption that the diesel fuel would be petroleum-based. One of the 
compelling aspects of diesel engines is their ability to run onbiodiesel, a 
fuel which does not actually contain any petroleum. Biodiesel is synthesized 
entirely from plants -- usually soy in the US, and canola/rapeseed in Europe -- 
and is therefore carbon-neutral: the soy/canola grown to create biodiesel pulls 
from the air the same amount of carbon the eventual combustion produces. 
Biodiesel is available both straight or in mixes with regular -- and, up until 
recently, somewhat less expensive -- oil-based diesel. These fuels are referred 
to by the percentage of biodiesel in the mix, from B5 (five percent bio) all 
the way to B100 (straight biodiesel); B20 is a relatively common mix. Avariety 
of companies supply biodiesel around the world; adventurous types can even make 
biodiesel at home, using vegetable oil.</p> 
<p>(Vegetable oil can be used to run diesel engines directly, although doing 
so can be somewhat risky. SVO, or &quot;straight vegetable oil,&quot; can gum 
up the engine at lower temperatures, so there areSVO-conversion kits available 
for diesel vehicles which use a small amount of regular diesel or biodiesel to 
warm up the engine first. This is one way that hybrid technology could really 
show its strengths: a hybrid-SVO could warm up the SVO with an electric heater 
while running on batteries at lower speeds, much like the current Prius does. 
Such a system could easily use regular diesel and biodiesel, as well.)</p> 
<p>European automakers are testing the water to see if American buyers, long 
ago turned off by earlier diesel technology, would be willing to give diesels 
another chance. The carmakers may want to wait for a couple of years; the 2006 
change-over to clean diesel will make diesel vehicles much more attractive. The 
manufacturers should take advantage of the wait to license the Toyota hybrid 
system (asFord did earlier this year) and integrate it with their advanced 
clean diesel engines. Stylish sedans coupling the power of a diesel engine with 
extreme fuel efficiency better than anything coming out of Japan -- dealers 
wouldn't be able to keep them in stock.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I love this idea. In the forums I've seen online, diesel enthusiasts and 
hybrid enthusiasts seem to always be at odds. There's no reason why we should 
be. A diesel hybrid would resolve that divide.</p> <br>

<p>When I hear the word &quot;diesel&quot;, I automatically think carcinogenic 
and mutagenic particulates in the exhaust. Which is why I hate being stuck 
behind a diesel vehicle, be it a truck, bus, or Mercedes 300D.</p> 
<p>I admit I'm completely ignorant of biodiesel and so-called &quot;clean 
diesel&quot;. What kinds of carcinogens and mutagens are present in these forms 
of diesel? What studies have been made to show either a total lack or dramatic 
reduction in both? (I would assume that &quot;clean&quot; means non-cancer 
causing, but maybe I'm wrong there too.)</p> 
<p>When I hear biodiesel I think, argibusiness looking for new markets.</p> 
<p>How can I learn more?</p> <br>
Posted by: Brian Dear on 3 Jun 04 <br>
<br>

<p>Brian,</p> 
<p>Clean road diesel (also known as ultra low sulfur diesel) is limited to 
particulate density of 30ppm, less than 10% of particulate density of standard 
road diesel; future efforts can bring that down to 15ppm. TheEPA has more info 
on clean diesel. Studies by the Australian government show a significant 
reduction in harmful emissions with ULSD. TheDieselNet site has more info, but 
some of it is only available to paid subscribers. It has good links to material 
from other sources, though.</p> 
<p>The production of biodiesel in large enough quantities to sustain a 
transportation network would certainly involve agribusiness. But agribiz is not 
the sole catalyst for biodiesel research; as I indicated in the post, the 
carbon-neutral nature of biodiesel, along with the simplicity of its 
production, make it a much more sustainable fuel resource.Biodiesel.org has 
some info, but they do seem to be allied with big ag.Journey to Forever may be 
more to your liking.</p> <br>

<p>The VW Lupo (a diesel) already has some elements of hybrid technology, 
including a continuous automatic transmission and electric motor for lower 
RPMs. From what I understand it gets around 80 mpg and is about the size of a 
mini cooper, and costs quite a bit less.</p> 
<p>I wish they would sell them here in the US but the quality of our diesel is 
too low. In 2006 this is supposed to change due to federal regulation, so at 
that point VW and other companies could sell these types of cars in the US.</p> 
<p>As far as the drawbacks of diesel are concerned, they have been taken care 
of. VW double-insulates the engine cage to make sure that noise is sufficiently 
dampened, and their are scrubbers on the exhaust to minimize the soot. And 
scrubbing the exhaust is unnecessary when using the high-grade diesel fuels. 
Test-drive a diesel and you will see that things have changed quite a bit. VW 
offers three diesel models in the US right now, all of which get about 40mpg 
city/45 highway: Golf, New Beetle and Jetta. The diesel Jetta also comes in a 
wagon version. They are all really nice cars.</p> <br>

<p>Diesel engines are perfectly suited for hybrids. <br>
 Diesels operate most 
effeciently when run at a<br>
 constant rpm and in a given temp range, both of 
which fit the hybrid model very well.</p> 
<p>For many years diesel trains have been driven<br>
 by a large diesel engine 
generating electricity to charge a battery bank turning electric motors to 
drive the train. It's the only way trains could get enough torque to start 
moving, but it is also exactly the model used by todays 2nd-gen hybrid autos. 
In a sense diesel locomotives were the first &quot;hybrids&quot;.</p> 
<p>Diesel engines are much simpler than gasoline engines, will burn about 
anything, and use<br>
 standard fuels which require much less refining than 
gasoline, and are safer to store and transport. And that doesn't even consider 
biodiesel. We could drastically reduce our reliance on petroleum by going the 
diesel hybrid route.</p> <br>

<p>Bio-diesel could forstall the ever depleating oil reserves said to be 
overwelmed by demand by 2016. Unfortunatly for us political preasure by lobying 
corporations will forstall reason.</p> <br>

<p>News of a diesel hybrid is very exciting. I'd like to point out that it's 
not only vege oil that can be used in diesel cars. As a NZer, I'm excited by my 
government's move toward re-using our meat industry by-product - tallow - as a 
fuel. Even better than growing crops to produce fuel, is using a waste product 
that would otherwise be of little profit for the meat industry, and be an 
environmental problem to dispose of. Companies like ASDA in the UK are already 
using chicken fat from their cooked chickens to fuel their trucks, thereby 
saving money and tax, and helping the environment. There is so much opportunity 
to improve the environment while boosting business at the same time. I hope 
more people will cotton on to this soon.</p> <br>

<p>Lawson, I wrote about the e-cycle earlier: Easy (and Green) Rider</p> 
<p>A biodiesel-based, ultra-efficient hybrid-diesel automobile &amp; 
transportation system would give a putative hydrogen economy a serious 
challenge, especially since the infrastructure changes required are far less 
dramatic, the necessary technology far less speculative, and the severence of 
ties to petroleum nations and industries far more complete.</p> <br>

<p>I do not comprehend URL. Please explain.</p> 
<p>I reside in Trinidad in the Caribbean and purchased a Mitsubishi 4WD L200 4 
door pickup with 2.5L normally aspirated diesel and the only way they come here 
is with a manual trans.</p> 
<p>For the past 5+ years the engine has been operating with a fuel mix of 25% 
dirty sulphur laden diesel and 75% kerosene - A1 Jet fuel. The exhaust is 
perfectly clean. You take a gasoline engine with the best tuning and this is 
cleaner.</p> 
<p>I am interested in the bio-diesel technology because the cleaner the burn 
the happier I am for the enviroment. My mix requires nothing special. Kerosene 
may not be readily available in the US or other locations. Here, kero was 
cheaper than diesel but the price was raised earlier this year to make them 
equal at TT$1.50 per liter. The US$1.00 is valued at TTS6.30 to give a 
comparison or US$0.24 per liter. We drill oil and have refineries and ship the 
products overseas. That is our local price.</p> 
<p>By the way, in all these years, nothing has had to be touched on the engine 
besides the replacement of the coolant pump 2 years ago. The mileage being 
clocked, hard miles in the boonies as well as highway, is 350,000 kilometers 
fairly trouble free with minimal exhaust pollution.</p> 
<p>From my addres you will realise that I am a friend of the enviroment using 
solar, wind and water as alternative renewable energy sources and encouraging 
others to do the same.</p> <br>

<p>Hybrid-diesels are indeed a great idea within the umbrella of &quot;each 
person should be moving 1,200-3,600 pounds of glass, steel, rubber and plastic 
everwhere they go&quot;. But personally I think that with current technology 
the automobile as the primary form of personal transportation is foolish.<br>
 
Especially foolish when we could switch to something likehttp://www.skytran.net 
and get the equivalent of hundreds of miles a gallon, not have to deal with 
traffic, not have to deal with bad drivers, and not have to deal with the 
hassles of owning a car (insurance, maintenance, registration etc.) and get 
from point a to point b at 100 mph. And we could do this with directly with 
electric energy (the advantage being that we could generate this with 
[currently affordable] wind power, solar power and or tidal power).<br>
 Yes, 
we'll still need construction vehicles, delivery vehicles, emergency vehicles, 
rural vehicles, farm vehicles and some will want recreational vehicles, but 
that is a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of vehicles that are on 
the road every year. Most miles driven are sub-urban and urban, and an effient 
people mover is what is needed. Most commercial products could be delivered to 
within a couple miles of thier final destination by rail, just as fast and more 
efficiently than they are now.</p> 
<p>The true cost of gas or diesel is easily greater than $5 a gallon (when 
federal corperate subsidies to oil companies and federal defence dollars used 
directly to protect US oil interests are included). Driving your car is public 
transportation (very, very expensive, very, very ineficient public 
transportation) in view of the cost of roads, petroleum subsidies, 
environmental damage, and loss of limb and life. Cars turn thier drivers into 
virtual supermen, allowing them to run at 65+ miles per hour for hours at a 
time while carrying extra thousands of pounds. Everyday there is evidence that 
people are not responsible enough to be those supermen.</p> 
<p>While biodiesel, petroleum from thermal depolymerisation 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization , and enzyme hydrolysis 
of plant cellulosehttp://www.purevisiontechnology.com/technology/hydrolysis.html
 all provide alternates to traditional petroleum ,there won't be enough to 
replace our currently wastefull usage. We need to begin moving as fast as we 
can towards sustainability now, that doesn't mean we must live less 
comfortably, but it does mean we need to think more about the consequences of 
all our decisions.</p> <br>

<p>Locomotives, submarines and many other types of vehicles have long used 
diesel-electric hybrid technology in one form or another. When Chrysler showed 
the Dodge Intrepid diesel-electric hybrid a few years ago, I was impressed. 
Here was a full sized car that was getting better fuel efficiency than most 
small cars and was a lot more convenient to drive than other alternative fuel 
vehicles. The only things holding it back then was emissions, but now that we 
have low sulfur diesel being mandated by Washington that hurdle should be 
cleared, and extra cost. There was something like a $12,000 price premium 
tacked on to the cost of a base Intrepid and not many people would shell out 
that kind of money. Advances in technology since then should have brought the 
price premium more in line with peoples wallets now so this is the time, 
Chrysler. Let's get that Intrepid hybrid out of the vault, update the tech, and 
start putting them on the street!!</p> <br>

<p>Hi i am looking for a kit to change my car from gas to diesel. I have 
friends in England who have been useing used cooking oil for quit some time in 
thier cars. They have had no problems with the cooking oil except in the 
winter. My friend say that there trucks over there also use the cooking oil Sam 
Club, WalMart etc:. I live in Florida which is warm about 95% of the time.<br>
 
My friend strain the used oil then puts it in thier cars and winter they use 
the diesel.<br>
 They get thiers use oil from restaurant so does WalMart,Sams 
Club also chines restaurant.<br>
 I hope this is good infomation for you.<br>
 
Please email me info, as to where i can get the kit to conver.</p> 
<p>Thank You,<br>
