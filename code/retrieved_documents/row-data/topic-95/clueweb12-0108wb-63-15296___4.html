<h2>Detroit Diesel Delivers First BlueTec Customer Demo Units</h2> 5/14/2009 
<br>  REDFORD, Mich. - Detroit Diesel Corporation has delivered its first two 
BlueTec(r) emissions technology customer demo units (CDU) to Schneider 
National, Inc., the nation's largest truckload carrier. The CDUs will be 
integrated into Schneider's fleet to gain valuable real-world experience with 
the technology in advance of EPA 2010 regulations.<br>
<br>
Delivered in late 
January 2009, the Schneider CDUs are Freightliner Cascadia's(tm) equipped with 
Detroit Diesel DD15(tm) engines, and have already logged more than 45,000 miles.
<br> <br>
Steve Duley, vice president of purchasing for Schneider National, 
noted that they keep close tabs on the units and provide Detroit Diesel 
feedback every day, including responses from drivers and technicians.<br>
<br>

&quot;By actually field testing the technology, we are putting the units into 
real-life situations, which ultimately helps Detroit Diesel engineers to 
identify every possible issue in advance,&quot; said Duley. &quot;We are 
confident the experience we gain from CDUs will give us additional time to 
prepare for the transition.&quot;<br>
<br>
Schneider's participation in the 
BlueTec field test is part of its ongoing commitment to running the most 
energy-efficient fleet in the industry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wise use of our natural 
resources is important to our customers and to Schneider National,&quot; said 
Duley. &quot;New technologies and spec'ing our equipment with energy-efficiency 
in mind is critical to delivering on that promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Duley added 
that a small group of drivers were briefed and trained in advance on the CDUs 
to further contribute to the testing and feedback.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our CDUs help 
customers like Schneider gain experience with BlueTec emissions technology well 
ahead of 2010, helping to provide an easy transition,&quot; said David Siler, 
director of marketing for Detroit Diesel.&quot; Plus, by working closely with 
Schneider, we will continue to refine our technology, ensuring exemplary 
performance and fuel economy.&quot;<br>
<br>
BlueTec - Daimler's widely 
acclaimed emissions technology - was selected by Detroit Diesel in 2005 to meet 
the upcoming stringent EPA 2010 emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. 
BlueTec represents the world's latest innovation for clean diesel engine 
technology.<br>
<br>
Based on Daimler's experience with more than 200,000 
trucks in Europe using BlueTec emissions technology and with more than 13 
million miles of testing completed, this is one of the first systems of its 
kind to improve fuel efficiency while reducing emissions to near-zero levels.
<br> <br>
Schneider National has been a Detroit Diesel customer since 1991, and 
more than 90 percent of its fleet is equipped with Detroit Diesel<br>
engines. 
<br> <br>
&quot;Detroit Diesel's responsiveness, people, and above all, 
quality, keeps us coming back. They listen to what we think is important, and 
they deliver every time,&quot; said Duley. &quot;We believe the BlueTec 
emissions technology is a very good alternative for meeting new regulations in 
an environmentally friendly way.&quot;<br>
