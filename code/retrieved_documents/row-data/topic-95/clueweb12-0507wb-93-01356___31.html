<h1>Mercedes ML 450 Hybrid</h1> <br>

<h3>The Mercedes ML450 is only available for lease&mdash;either 36 or 60 
months at $659 or $549 per month, respectively. Mercedes cited &quot;limited 
supply of batteries&quot; as the reason.</h3> 
<p>Mercedes-Benz has long been known for its diesels. In fact, it introduced 
the 260D, the world&rsquo;s first passenger car powered by a diesel engine, 
back in 1936. But proud of its reputation for advanced technology in general, 
it has been hedging its bets with hybrids as well.</p> 
<h2>Gasoline, Or Diesel, Or Hybrid?</h2> 
<p>At the New York Auto Show in April 2009, it unveiled its latest hybrid 
project, the 2010 Mercedes-Benz ML450 Hybrid. It&rsquo;s the latest expansion 
in its ML sport utility line, and it makes the ML the first vehicle in the 
world to offer gasoline, diesel, and hybrid alternatives.</p> 
<h3>Compare the Mercedes ML450!</h3> 
<p>If you're thinking about buying a Mercedes ML450, you might also consider a 
Lexus RX450h or a Mercedes ML 320 Bluetec.Compare these vehicles.</p> 
<p>The three drivetrains return a range of mileage figures. The 
all-wheel-drive ML350 with a standard gasoline engines gets 15 mpg city / 20 
mpg highway, with larger V8 versions doing far worse. As for the green 
alternatives, the clean diesel ML320 BlueTec delivers 18 mpg city / 24 mpg 
highway, and now the ML450 Hybrid model tops the list, with 20 mpg city / 24 
mpg highway.</p> 
<p>The new ML model, built in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is fitted with the Two-Mode 
Hybrid system jointly developed by General Motors, Daimler, Chrysler, and BMW.
</p> 
<h2>Bigger, Better Battery&mdash;And Cooler Too</h2> 
<p>The Mercedes-Benz version of the Two-Mode system combines a 275-horsepower, 
3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine and two electric motors. Together, the complete 
powertrain delivers 335 horsepower and 381 foot-pounds of torque. But 
Mercedes-Benz has fitted its own, larger nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, 
which at 2.4 kilowatt-hours is almost half again as large as the packs used in 
GM&rsquo;s various Two-Mode hybrids. And Benz uses liquid cooling to keep its 
pack healthy and the cells operating at best efficiency, complete with a 
&ldquo;super chiller&rdquo; to blast the pack with coolant when the electrical 
system is under stress&mdash;towing a trailer uphill in desert heat, for 
example.</p>

<p>None of those components comes cheap, though Mercedes-Benz may have more 
leeway to charge higher prices than more mass-market big SUVs like the Chevy 
Tahoe/GMC Yukon twins.</p> 
<p>Like other hybrids, the Two-Mode can move the car at low speeds purely on 
electric power for short distances. But unlike &ldquo;single-mode&rdquo; full 
hybrids, including the archetypal Toyota Prius, the pair of electrical motors 
and several gear-sets also provide electrical assist to the gasoline engine at 
highway speeds&mdash;hence the name &ldquo;Two-Mode.&quot;</p> 
<p>Externally, the only difference between the new Hybrid and other MLs is the 
grille and a slightly domed hood&mdash;to clear the power electronics, mounted 
up front on top of the engine. In an odd transposition, the company&rsquo;s AMG 
tuning unit liked the looks of the humped hood so much that it is using that 
part on its high-performance versions of the ML as well.</p> 
<p>During a test drive in Manhattan traffic and up the West Side Highway along 
the Hudson River, the ML450 Hybrid clearly distinguished itself from the GM 
Two-Mode sport utilities&mdash;even the posh Escalade version. Drivetrain noise 
is all but imperceptible, and the sound damping (known as NVH by auto 
engineers, for Noise-Vibration-Harshness) is exemplary.</p> 
<p>In fact, most drivers might only figure out that this ML was a hybrid by 
the engine tone, which like most hybrids doesn&rsquo;t rise in parallel with 
road speed. Instead, this hybrid and others sound like cars with continuously 
variable transmissions&mdash;which their hybrid systems simulate by shifting 
power among the modes and running the engine at its most efficient speeds, 
taking up the slack with the electric motors.</p> 
<h2>Simulating An Eight-Speed Automatic</h2> 
<p>Nonetheless, Benz is concerned that some ML owners might find it unpleasant 
to experience that disconnect between engine speed and road speed. So, the 
company developed a &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; mode that controls the engine to 
simulate the behavior of an eight-speed automatic transmission. According to 
hybrid control systems engineer Konstantin Neiss, using Shift mode imposes 
about a 3-percent penalty on fuel economy.</p> 
<p> Unlike Japanese makers like Toyota and Honda, Mercedes-Benz is using 
hybrid technology to improve the mileage of its largest, heaviest 
vehicles&mdash;recognizing that upcoming gas-mileage regulations will hit its 
lineup disproportionately hard. With the diesel and hybrid ML variants 
competing head to head, industry analysts will eagerly be watching to see how 
much wealthy Mercedes-Benz buyers value various levels of mileage, whether 
hybrids prove more appealing than oil burners and, most importantly, at what 
price points. It should be a fascinating model year for Mercedes.</p> <br>

<p>-If General Motors came up with a revolutionary new &quot;green&quot; car 
that got 24 mpg EPA max, people would be (rightly) condemning them. Mercedes 
does it, and our press gives them rave reviews. What a scam.</p>

<p>I own a 2007 ML 350 and I get 19 city and 22 hwy. This is my 2nd Benz that 
gets above posted sticker gas mileage. I average 70 on the highway which may 
help. I'm hopeful that the hybrid also does better than sticker. All the ford 
and GM cars I have had do worse than what the sticker promised. I love my Benz 
and have had no mechanical problems with either of my vehicles from MB. For 
those that wonder why the lexus gets better numbers check the curb weight. The 
MB is a much heavier sturdier roomier vehicle.</p>

<p>24 isn't a joke when compared to the regular gasoline versions (20 at

exact same highway mileage numbers.</p> 
<p>Doesn't the new Insight also have a simulated shifting mode for its CVT?? 
It isn't just Mercedes doing this... besides, you don't have to use the mode

<p>nhohn: Glad your mileage is better than sticker (although 22 highway is not 
very good). Wonder if these generalizations should then be applied to all 
ML350's, or if that's just an n=1 sample. Any ideas how MB can sell these and 
avoid the &quot;gas hog&quot; image that plagues GM? Maybe all that 
&quot;engineering&quot; justifies the inefficiency??</p> 
<p>Do you have quantification for the &quot;sturdier&quot; and 
&quot;roomier&quot; descriptors? Or is it just bulkier?</p> 
<p>This is an inexcusably overweight, dangerous vehicle. If we all felt we 
&quot;needed&quot; to drive one, we would be spending even more of our capital 
on gas and oil. Maybe that's the key to stimulating the economy, eh? Like 
Napoleon said, &quot;I can do anything I want to, and some philosopher will 
justify it for me.&quot;</p>

<p>You did not look at the horse power of this car vs the other hybrids. If 
you make a go cart like Toyota of course it will get good gas milage. Try to 
make a 325 HP SUV that gets 24MPG that is safe. That is great engineering.</p>

<p>Not safe??? Dangerous even??? WOW. I would be in ANY Benz versus anything 
built by Lexus. I see wrecked vehicles all day, every day. Lexus RX's (Toyota 
Highlander in a dress) crumple like tin cans. The metal on any body panel of an 
RX is significantly thinner than anything Benz puts out. Not to mention Benz 
ups the ante with double redundant hood latches with spring tensioners, double 
firewall cowling with a full peripheral seal for the engine compartment to 
counter intrusion into the passenger compartment, a hardened steel front 
subframe, FAR more extensive use of ultra high-strength-low-alloy steel 
throughout, a thick energy absorbing foam under the feet of every passenger to 
minimize leg injury, 2 extra airbags, and an electronic stability program 
(utilizing the vehicles braking system, transmission, and traction control 
system) that is UNRIVALED by anyone. Even the interior trim on the A, B, and C 
pillars is designed to absorb and dissapate energy in case of an accident. 
Mercedes also does their developmental crash testing at a higher KPH/MPH than 
any other manufacturer (52 mph for rollovers, for example). Do some research 
before you make claims that you obviously know nothing about.</p>

<p>I have been working on the ML 450 for 2 years now and driving one for the 
last year. For testing purposes we often run these things as hard as we can for 
hours at a time. Full throttle at every stop, 120+ on the highway and I still 
get ~ 24 mpg every time. After driving a ML 550 for a while I can feel the 
battery weight in the boot, but it doesn't make the car seem overly heavy. Yes, 
a Escape hybrid gets much better mpg, but it still drives like a Ford. This is 
a pure Mercedes.</p>

<p>Not all hybrids need to be more energy efficient that a Prius. The purpose 
of efficiency is that we need all cars to improve within their class. Not 
everyone can, or will, drive a Prius. I congratulate MB for producing a car 
that improves mileage by 20+ percent while providing a better driving 
experience over a similar ML. If we continue to improve the existing vehicle 
stock each year by 10-20% then we can remove oure dependency on foreign sources 
of oil by 2022... So get rid of you clunker and go buy one!</p>

<p>Who in their right mind would even think of comparing a Lexus RX 450H to 
the new Mercedes ml450 hybrid.</p> 
<p>After four years of driving my RX400H (2006) which averaged 10.2 Litres/100 
klms in both severe winter driving as well as summer, without any service other 
than scheduled, why would I even think of Benz.</p> 
<p>My wife drives a 2009 CL550 4matic which has spent more time in service, 
than on the road. Not knit picking issues, serious safety issues and mechanical.
</p> 
<p>This is my tenth Lexus since 2000 and cannot remember ever needing to have 
it repaired for faulty workmanship or failures.</p> 
<p>My 2010 Rx450H is now 2 months old and averaging 9.2 litres per 100 KLMS. 
(31mpg) with 295 HP. Average speed of 68 mph. No service incidents, just 
friendly calls from Lexus if I am satisfied.</p> 
<p>FYI, my wife has owned 8 mercedes models from ML, CLK, to CL. Again, 
serious issues with each.</p> 
<p>Oh Well, I guess the badge is more important than the reality.</p> 
<p>This is MBs first attempt at Hybrid in an SUV. When they have the resume 
that Lexus and Toyota have with Hybrid, lets then take another look.</p>

extreme accidents , head on, out of control at high speed, even collissions 
with semis. I thank God for my own and my familys safety. Safety is number one 
with me. mpg is nice,.the power has gotten me out of a number of situations 
where just a little extra acceleration saved me. oh yeah mpg is nice too. Hi

<p>I have owned the ML 450 Hybrid for 3 days, I bought it new, and so far I am 
completely dismayed that they even let this thing off the assembly line. So far 
for the first 5-10 minutes of driving there are major electronic failures and 
then magically all the systems start working once it warms up. The systems that 
don't work are the, auto lights, the back up camera, the reverse lights, the 
turn signals, the airbags failure light is on, the check engine light is on, 
and the hybrid system seems to not work. I just traded in the prius to get this 
and although I was very happy with the mileage, the car was not very nice. I 
can't get this ML hybrid to get anything better than 22mpg on the hwy and it 
gets 10-12 in the city. I called the dealer and told them I want to turn it in 
because it must be a lemon. I feel completely ripped off considering this car 
costs 15k more than the normal gas version and gets the same mileage. It drives 
great and is definitely a luxury vehicle but with turn signals its totally 
useless and dangerous.</p>

<p>So the dealer fixed the electrical problem, turned out to be a loose wire 
somewhere. At the end of the dat the car is definitely a MB and if you like 
that then you like that. the car gets no where near its rated mileage no matter 
who drives it. Is it worth the premium over the gas version, no not if you are 
making that decision based on MPG. If you want the cache of driving a hybrid 
and that makes you feel good and you love MB then this is the car for you. So 
for me at the end of the day I like how the car drives and its probably very 
safe but I also feel that its a waste of money to get the hybrid since it does 
little to nothing to improve gas mileage.</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz charges a premium for their vehicles; they are able to do so 
because they provide superior styling, impeccable luxury, and most importantly, 
convenience. Many people find CVT-like transmissions to be whiny and obnoxious, 
especially when flooring the throttle. The idea of a transmission that shifts 
like a normal car when the driver is feeling sporty is an ingenious idea, for 
it simply uses technology to slightly tweak the behavior of the extremely 
complicated, yet well thought out transmission, in order to satisfy every 
customer that would consider owning a 335HP ML450h.</p> 
<p>The Ml450 sure sold me, I prefer the hybrid drive to the diesel, and most 
of my driving takes place in the city, therefore I achieve better gas mileage, 
a smoother, quieter ride, and when I'm stuck in stop and go traffic, I am 
burning zero fuel while keeping the A/C and all other electronics running. On 
the same note, I still have the convenience of an SUV with 4-wheel drive, that 
maintains mercedes' luxury, and achieves excellent gas milage numbers. The part 
that tops it off is that my mercedes, unlike other hybrids in the industry, 
isn't going to try to kill me by driving itself into intersections.</p> 
<p>I plan on picking mine up within the next couple of weeks. I cannot wait.

<p>Leased the 2010 ML450 a little over a month ago and have 1000 miles on it. 
Never have owned a German car before...kind of always been a Ford gal. Loved my 
2 Expeditions but it was time to have a smaller SUV...couldn't give up the 
usefullness/practicality of an SUV...for groceries, kids' stuff and soccer 
equipment.<br>
 I have to say, I am truly enjoying this MB...never really 
thought I'd get a hybrid, due to loss of horsepower mainly...but this Mercedes 
is quick, smooth and really fun to drive. I'm averaging exactly 21-22 in the 
city and 24-25 mpg on the highway...for an SUV that is so safe AND sturdy, I 
think this is great...my 07 expedition averaged 10 mpg in the city...Don't look 
at just mpg when comparing the Lexus and Mercedes, instead drive them and feel 
the power and solidness of the two vehicles...I think you'll find the ML450 
much more appealing. My only criticism would be that Leather seating should be 
standard on this car (esp. with 64K pricetag) as MBtex is not the greatest. 
Love, Love that it is AWD too.</p>

<p>I leased an ML450 6 weeks ago. It now has 2300 miles on it and has been 
wonderful. There was an issue with the glue on the sunroof visor emitting an 
&quot;onion&quot; odor when it got hot. Mercedes is working on a fix for this, 
and of course drove an hour to pick my car up and leave a loaner for me while 
it was being addressed. Not an inconvenience at all.</p> 
<p>For those who are badmouthing the vehicle, Perhaps you've never driven or 
owned a European luxury vehicle. I see many people like you being keyboard 
heroes and reciting what you take as gospel from the Internet. Sure, European 
vehicles may have more mechanical failiures than a Japanese vehicle, but they 
are also at the very forefront of automotive technology and safety. Consider 
this, if you'd like to see what equipment will be on your 
Honda/Toyota/Chevy/Ford in ten years, go out and look at today's Mercedes Benz. 
And remember who invented the automobile!</p> 
<p>My mileage has been very good, and I commend MB on achieving 24+ highway 
economy with a vehicle that makes 335hp, 381tq, and weighs in at almost 5300 
lbs.</p> 
<p>Having owned two acuras, a number of Saabs, a Honda and a VW, I'm glad I 
made the leap to true luxury and since I've accomplished myself to the point 
where I can drive these vehicles, I won't be looking back. Remember, Mercedes 
came out with the hybrid to give drivers V8 performance with a bit better fuel 
economy. As a consumer spending $61k on this vehicle, mileage isn't the first 
of my &quot;important features.&quot; Safety, performance, utility, and comfort 
are. The mileage is just a great benefit that comes with this package.</p> 
<p>Good luck to the naysayers with your &quot;Consumer Reports Approved&quot; 
&quot;I drive one too&quot; Japanese cars, but anyone who has one of these 
vehicles surely feels the same as me.</p>

<p>Would anyone know if/when the two mode technology will reach the GL series? 
That would be vehicle which could benefit from this tech -especially for city 
mileage.</p>

<p>I currently drive the RX 400h by Lexus and I like the truck. However, I am 
considering returning to the ML series and prefer to lease the hybrid SUV. 
After reading these comments, I am not sure whaich way to go now. I stopped by 
my dealership a few days ago and the salesperson did not win me over with his 
viewpoint of the ML hybrid SUV. Notwithstanding, he tells me there are none in 
the country at this time but wanted me to test the diesel verson of which I am 
not interested.</p> 
<p>Help!!</p>

<p>I leased the ML450 in May and LOVE it. I drive both highways and stop start 
traffic everyday. The car is so comfortable, I get great gas mileage-My average 
over the life of the car is 23 mpg. I typically get 27-30 MPG on the way home 
from work. I too have owned several Acuras as well as a VW that I turned in 
because it was too small and had terrible transmission problems. It feels like 
I am driving on air and handles like a car half its size. I would reccommend 
this car to anyone. This is my first MB and the fifth one in my household. We 
obviously love the brand but that is not why I love the car. I feel safe, it 
looks great and it rides like a dream.</p>

<p>Have 3600 miles on my ML and I am very pleased. It delivers at or above the 
rated mileage on every tank. If Toyota built a 5300 lb , 335 horse power full 
time all wheel drive SUV I doubt it would do any better. I drove a 2010 CRV 
cross country this summer and it got the same mileage as my ML. All in all a 
very good car.</p>

<p>My ML450 is approaching 8,000 miles and I am extremely pleased with its 
performance. It handles very well and is very quiet. It has averaged 24.5 mpg 
combined city/highway and seems to be averaging better as the miles rack up. 
The past few highway trips have averaged right around 27 mpg. I have had zero 
issues with the vehicle. It accelerates very well and has an incredibly short 
stopping distance from highway speed for such a heavy vehicle. I spend about a 
thousand miles a week in my vehicle and this one is extremely comfortable.</p>

<p>My '95 MB gets 23/32 mpg ... Its nimble and quick , and super comfy.<br>
 
Hubbys MB is an '84 diesel w over 500,000 mi.. He drives it 450 mi per<br>
 
week still.... They last forever , run well &amp; my MB is cheaper to fix than
<br> our '07 pt cruiser.. Were looking at a '10 E class station wagon now for
<br> a &quot;road trip&quot; car. Mercedes have proven to be well worth the 
cost. Our 11 yr old grandson wants the diesel when he turns 16.... Pretty sure 
it will still be running. Hybrid sounds good ... But I'd still never buy it new.

<p>SPOK, how do you feel about the ml 450 hybird after owning it for a few 
more months? driven it in snow yet?</p> 
<p>also, if you put on a thousand miles a week, why not the diesel? i own a 
2006 ml and am considering a new one. cant decide on diesel or hybrid. i also 
put on a lot of (highway) miles so was leaning towards a diesel. but it seems 
that by owning a hybrid, i still get great highway mileage plus an upside - 
also higher local mpg.</p> 
<p>would appreciate your thoughts.</p>

<p>Really you posted that, your tenth Lexus since 2000...Who is really wearing 
a badge, a badge for a new car every year!!! Or was it so bad that you had to 
trade them in becuase they needd help? If your wife's CL550 has had so many 
SERIOUS, as you say, safety issues, Mercedes would have traded it. Anytime 
Mercedes' have the same issue more than three times they replace it. When 
looking at Toyota and Lexus' resumes you will see they have spent far more 
money repairing their faulty vehicles and paying damages to families who have 
been killed in their vehicles. If the US and the stupid regulations we have 
would let Mercedes and other European vehicles into this country we could buy 
the more gas friendly A and B class Mercedes. It may be their first attempt, 
but that is only because it takes time and knowledge to create excellence, only 
a fool rushes in... enjoy throwing your money away on ten more Lexus'...we have 
had over four Mercedes for over 20 years and not problem, maybe you should 
evaluate your driving.</p>

<p>They've got a fantastic diesel engine (I own one in a 07 GL) which gets 
amazingly high mileage (26 mpg). I don't understand why not couple this with 
the existing hybrid system. It'd have to be 30+ mpg at that point. Yes/No? Yes, 
the car has has minor issues in 70,000 miles. (one sensor, and it's rusting 
after a repair that was made poorly, AFTER buying it as a CPO car) but the 
mechanical issue is expected at that mileage. The paint wasn't an MB product 
apparently, and disgusts me. I'm in love with the car 4 years later, but MB CPO 
failed to take care of the issues, 2 months after ownership...I'd do it again 
though. Honestly..</p>

<p>I have a 2010 ML450. I find that it's apx.20 Mpg around Anchorage to be a 
plus, but this last week end I went fishing at Skilak Lake a total trip of 274 
miles including 3 boat ferrying trips totaling 42 of those miles. My average 
gas milage was 27.3. The weight of the boat, motor and trailer is near 1000 
lbs. 22 of the miles were driven on gravel &amp; sand roadway.</p>
