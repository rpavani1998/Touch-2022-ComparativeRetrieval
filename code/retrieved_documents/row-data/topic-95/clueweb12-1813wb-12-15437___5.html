<h1>Volkswagen up! Concept Series</h1> <br>

<p>It's hard to keep up with the Volkswagen up! concept car. In 
two-and-half-years, the microcar has been unveiled as a betterSmart ForTwo, a 
family of mini cars, an all-electric car, and most recently a lightweight 
diesel hybrid. VW talks about putting the car into production in a few years, 
but with each new iteration the timeline moves further back.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When the up! showed up at auto shows in 2007, the micro-car was used as a 
counterpoint to the company's clean diesels (on the way at the time). Here was 
VW's chance to talk about a small car that could get close to 80 mpg. The 
vision of a better microcar&mdash;with a sleeker design, better handling and 
higher fuel efficiency than the Smart ForTwo&mdash;was enhanced with the 
proposal that there would be an array of up! variants, including a 
short-wheelbase 3-door hatchback and a long wheelbase 5-door hatchback&mdash;as 
well as a sedan, convertible and crossover. The concept 3-door Volkswagen up! 
was 135 inches long, while the 4-door variant was 141.7 inches. There was also 
talk of gas, diesel and fuel cell powertrain options.</p> 
<p> VW space up! blue</p> 
<p>By the time the up! hit the Los Angeles auto show later in 2007, it had 
become the &quot;space up! blue,&quot; a mini minivan measuring 145 inches 
long, and boasting interior space comparable to a much larger vehicle. It was 
presented as an all-electric vehicle capable of a 65-mile range, or a fuel cell 
microvan with 220 miles of driving, with help from a rooftop solar panel.</p> 
<p>Right around that time, UK's <em>Autocar</em> awarded the up! as the 
concept car of the year.<em>Autocar</em> editor Charles Hallett said the up! 
was &quot;a brilliant concept car, but importantly a concept car that will 
become a reality.&quot;<em>Car and Driver</em> said it was certainly heading to 
the United States.</p> 
<h2>Moving Target</h2> 
<p>The car reemerged&mdash;transformed into an electric car and re-named the 
e-up!&mdash;for the 2009 Frankfurt auto show. The rumored production schedule 
for the electric up! is around 2013. The e-up! takes the form of a 10.5 foot 
minicar that seats four&mdash;three in front and one in back. Top speed is less 
than 85 miles per hour, with a 0-60 mph pace of about 11 seconds. The e-up! 
weighs about 2,400 pounds&mdash;with more than 500 pounds coming from the 18 
kWh battery pack that can deliver about 80 miles of range from a single charge. 
The driver activates forward or reverse gear via a rotary knob in the center 
console.</p> 
<p><em>Automotive News</em> reported that a slightly larger version was being 
considered for the US market, sometime after a European introduction.</p> 
<p> VW e-up! </p> 
<p>VW suggested that the E-up! could be the &ldquo;Beetle for the 21st 
Century,&rdquo; the same reference it had made from the earliest concept 
version two years earlier. The VW logo on the V-shaped engine bonnet of the 
e-up! is more than just an homage to the Beetle. Hidden behind the folding logo 
is the integrated port for charging the batteries. The concept car has a 
touch-screen interface that monitors battery state of charge, provides traffic 
data, and locates available charging stations.</p> 
<h2>A Game of One (More) Upmanship</h2> 
<p> Vw up! lite </p> 
<p>A couple of months later, the up! showed up at the 2009 Los Angeles auto 
show, this time as the &quot;up! lite.&quot; This version of the up! combines a 
lightweight aluminum body, tiny 0.8-liter turbo-diesel engine, electric motor 
and 7-speed direct shift gearbox to produce a small sporty diesel-hybrid 
capable of nearly 100 miles to the gallon, according to Volkswagen. VW calls it 
&ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most environmentally friendly four-seat car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So folks, take your pick of which up! concept you like the best. Some form 
of one of them could go into production, if VW delivers on its promise to 
introduce a &ldquo;new small family&rdquo; microcar sometime around 2011.</p>

<p>VW has great ideas, but i can only see concepts.</p> 
<p>Its time to take a decision on assembling at least one of the concepts.</p> 
<p>They are turning experts on marketing, with no news.</p>

<p>I find the Volvo news much more exciting. Why? Because this would be really 
something if it was the first time we heard it. But VW is always coming out 
with a prototype for something. But where are the cars? Yes, the new diesel 
jetta is nice, but I feel like VW is purposefully dragging their feet in the 
ev/hybrid arena.</p>

<p>How about this VW? An air-cooled clean-diesel plug-in hybrid sports-wagon. 
You could call it the Up Chuck... ;-p</p>

<p>I've heard everything there is to know about these cars but I didn't hear 
enough about their safety features. Are there any? It would help me know more 
about this, this way I have an extra chance toget car insurance quotes that fit 
my pocket.</p>

<p>Good to hear about it. But it's hard to get car insurance for small or 
hybrid car as they are accident prone.<br>

<p>It is hard to get insurance for a car that is accident prone, but it is not 
impossible. I had a hard time findingcar insurance but I did and it ended up 
being better than anything else I found.</p>

<p>Volkswagen's fortunes in North America improved once the third-generation 
Golf and Jetta models became available there. Marketing efforts included Trek 
bicycles with accompanying bicycle racks on the one nine nine six Jetta sedan. 
The introductions of the New Beetle and the fifth generation Passat were a 
major boost to the brand. Thanks.<br>

<p>The consumers in the lucrative US market began turning to small cars with 
better fuel economy. American car manufacturers had considered small economy 
cars to be an entry level product, and their small vehicles employed a low 
level of quality in order to keep the price low. Thanks.<br>
