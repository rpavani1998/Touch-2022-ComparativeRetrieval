<h1>A Vision of the Future - Available Now - New player, Banke Accessory 
Drives launches 'Plug-in' Hybrid system</h1> <br>

<p></p> <br>
The 26tonne gross weight Volvo/Zoeller refuse collection vehicle 
(RCV) fitted with Banke modular 'Plug-in' battery pack was demonstrated to 
members of the Danish Parliament in early January <br>
<br>

<p></p>
<p><strong>This story has it all - an idealistic inventor, the need to save 
the planet and a sceptical 'public'. Malcolm Bates reports from Copenhagen on a 
small Danish manufacturer of a 'plug-in' hybrid drive bin lift and compaction 
system, and how it's benefiting from a whole new way of doing business - the 
Lean Energy Cluster.</strong></p> 
<p></p>
<p>To be honest, Rasmus Banke doesn't look like a 'mad professor'. In fact, my 
hair is wilder than his. And I'm probably closer to being 'mad' than he is too. 
But that should just illustrate how appearances can be deceptive. And why the 
views Rasmus Banke holds could be key to our future.</p>
<p></p> <br>
A New Year, a New Approach to business? A well-attended meeting 
was held inside the Parliament building by the Lean Energy Cluster to outline 
the advantages of companies working together (in a 'cluster') on a specific 
project <br>
<br>

<p></p>
<p>I've been invited to a special meeting in the Danish Parliament. It has 
been convened by an organisation called The Lean Energy Cluster (of which Banke 
is a member) to discuss 'the future'. The future of our planet that is. The 
future role Denmark should play (as a small nation with a big reputation for 
turning visionary ideas into workable government policies) and the ways in 
which business might be done in the future, in a resource starved world. It 
also involves the future of the humble garbage truck - and the role it could 
play in helping us maximise what resources we have left. As I'm sure you'll 
agree, that's a pretty demanding agenda for a single meeting - so let's get 
down to analysing the key elements....</p>
<p></p>
<p>None of us know what life on earth will be like in 50 years time. And as it 
involves forces outside of 'waste management', let's put that to one side. How 
about Denmark? This small, but incredibly honest democratic European state has 
an enviable record on sustainability, on implementing visionary environmental 
policies and being prepared to invest - by which I mean 'spend' citizens' tax 
money - to a far greater degree than just about any other country on earth. Why 
do they do it? Partly because Danes think it's the right thing to do, but also 
as Martin Lidegaard, the Danish minister for energy explained, because 
investing in long-term solutions really can pay a good return while improving 
the environment and creating more jobs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact, designing and building high tech environmental solutions is now 
very much the 'industry' Denmark would like to be known for internationally. 
And unlike many other democracies, all the political parties in Denmark support 
this high investment approach.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Save energy - boost economic growth</h2>
<p></p>
<p>What difference can individual Governments make to a global problem?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The long-sighted policies of Denmark should serve as an example to us all - 
and shame those larger national governments that claim the imposition of strict 
new environmental policies will damage growth and cause increased unemployment. 
The example set by Denmark explodes that myth - environmental technologies look 
set to create over 10,000 new jobs in the next five years. &quot;But when it 
comes to more specific policies like reducing energy consumption by the country 
as a whole, and by organisations and individuals in particular, the Danish 
Government strongly believes all Government departments, regional and local 
city councils and communes, should be leading by example,&quot; the Minister 
confirmed to Waste Management World.</p>
<p></p> <br>
The Zoeller-produced compactor body/hopper and binlifters can be 
operated without need to run the engine - demonstrating how noise and fuel can 
be saved <br>
<br>

<p></p>
<p>Even to the point of, for example, waste management authorities being 
encouraged to invest in more advanced technical solutions, rather than - as 
currently - be pressured to accept the lowest price for new vehicles, or when 
awarding an operational contract? &quot;Yes, very much so. The Danish 
Government believes such targeted investment is vital if energy consumption is 
to be reduced and our economy is to grow in a future of increasing energy 
costs,&quot; he adds. 'Green energy' exports totalled over 50 billion Danish 
Krona ($8.5 billion) in 2011. Almost 10% of all exports.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And if you think Denmark has a pretty positive record on recycling ratios 
and minimising landfill - as it has - then that's as nothing compared to the 
impressive record the county has on energy conservation. Thanks to previous 
long-term government policies and investment, Denmark uses no more energy today 
than it did in 1980, while also achieving an impressive reduction in CO2 
emissions well above the European average. Over that same period, economic 
growth has increased four-fold.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But because we don't tend to think of Denmark as a major industrial 
producer of manufactured goods, it's interesting to note that the Danish 
Government uses its remit to help encourage new, achievable ways of creating 
new technologies to help boost an already impressive record on creating what we 
might term an environmental industry sector. How? This is where 'The Lean 
Energy Cluster' comes in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you come from a time when the only trends in industry seemed to involve 
large, multinational organisations and venture capitalists mopping-up smaller 
innovative companies, then this story will come - excuse the environmental pun 
- as a breath of fresh air. What is a 'Cluster'? It's a new way of doing 
business. Forget one company needing to 'be in charge', or owning all the other 
players, a cluster is lots of smaller specialists coming together on a specific 
project and co-operating together as equals.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Significant savings</h2>
<p></p>
<p>It works like this: a specific project is identified as the right thing to 
do environmentally. In this case we're talking about replacing the 
hydraulically-driven compaction equipment and bin/container lifters on a refuse 
collection vehicle (garbage truck), by a 'Plug-in' battery/electric system. Why 
is this such a good idea?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most publicised gain is in a reduction of CO2 (typically 15 tonnes per 
vehicle per year) and a reduction in diesel fuel consumption of 5000 litres per 
vehicle per year - both significant figures. But I'd suggest the other key gain 
- a considerable reduction in operational noise - has not been promoted as 
widely as it could have been.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is some nervousness amongst some RCV manufacturers because as we 
discovered in the previous issue of Waste Management World, if more operators 
purchased large numbers of quieter diesel electric hybrid RCVs and double 
shifted them with two crews during each 24 hour period, which helps recoup the 
added purchase cost for obvious reasons, this might result in fewer number of 
vehicles being needed in total.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banke sees things rather differently. Firstly, after a background in energy 
systems, he is convinced that the electrical power take-off (PTO) is more 
efficient than the traditional hydraulic PTO. Fuel consumption is less because 
the truck power unit is only required to propel the vehicle along and not to 
generate hydraulic power while stationary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most observers would accept that the constant rise and fall of engine revs, 
as hydraulic binlifters are used, is what makes night time waste collection 
operations in residential areas unacceptable. In contrast, a 'plug-in' battery 
powered auxiliary drive enables the truck's engine to be switched off while 
loading and packing, or stay at a constant tick-over. So far, so 
environmentally friendly.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A new way forward</h2>
<p></p>
<p>While a number of manufacturers are now offering such 'hybrid' options, or 
are involved in trying to build prototypes, according to Banke, there is an 
overriding problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Designing and building systems using the latest battery technology is 
a very specialised business and we should ask why each manufacturer needs an 
in-house solution? In other branches of industry such as building construction, 
shipping, industrial processes and power generation for example, there are 
large specialists such as Danfoss that research, design and build systems for 
incorporation into wider projects. I would argue that in helping to promote a 
new generation of refuse collection trucks, the waste and recycling sector 
should follow that model,&quot; he suggests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banke is passionate about these issues. So passionate in fact, he gave up a 
top job with Danfoss A/S in order to found Banke Accessory Drives. Already, the 
company is working with ten or more 'partners' on this first project. And when 
you hear that from initial concept, to starting the company, putting together 
the Cluster, to actually having a prototype Hybrid RCV ready to enter service 
took just two years, you might be impressed enough to conclude that inventor or 
not, Rasmus Banke is far from 'mad'. The Lean Energy Cluster has direct support 
from the Danish Government, the local regional Councils and the leading 
technical university of Southern Denmark. It also has the support of Manfred 
Zoeller, CEO of leading German manufacturer Zoeller Waste Systems and 
Meldgaard, one of Denmark's leading commercial waste contractors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what does all this mean? It will hopefully mean that the concept of more 
efficient, environmentally friendly refuse collection vehicles is no longer a 
dream, unique to one brand, or another. As Soren Jessing, development engineer 
for Banke Accessory Drives explains: &quot;Our solution is modular. It's 
adaptable without a major increase in tooling costs - so will benefit from an 
economy of scale.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Could a hybrid option help win contracts?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We'll soon find out if he's right - with a fleet of over 150 'conventional' 
diesel/hydraulic PTO-powered refuse collection and recycling trucks, Meldgaard 
is keen to convert to hybrids as soon as possible. Why? &quot;We are putting 
the Banke Hybrid to work alongside our existing vehicles so we can compare 
performance,&quot; CEO Henrik Meldgaard, explained. &quot;We were very 
interested in the model adopted by the Commune in the city of Solna in Sweden 
(as reported in Waste Management World November/December 2011).</p>
<p></p> <br>
The hybrid RCV will enter service with Danish waste management 
operator Meldgaard, to provide comparisons with existing diesel-fuelled 
hydraulically activated RCVs <br>
<br>

<p></p>
<p>Putting a value against the environmental gains in a waste collection 
contract as a way of encouraging higher standards appeals to us,&quot; he adds. 
&quot;And we are already talking to several Communes (Councils) with which we 
have contracts on that basis.&quot; Meldgaard has sixteen waste contracts in 
Denmark and is looking to win more - a 'hybrid option' may just provide the way 
to win them.</p>
<p></p> <br>
This view shows how little body space is taken up by the battery 
pack. Located by just eight bolts, the same basic 'module' can be designed to 
fit any chassis/body combination <br>
<br>

<p></p>
<p>Adding environmental 'House Points' to the contract bidder prepared to 
invest in more expensive, environmentally friendly vehicles (as opposed to just 
the cheapest) is supported by the Danish Government and regional governments 
such as Region Syddanmark - another active supporter of the Lean Energy 
Cluster. But aside from a radically different business model, are there any 
technical issues that need taking on board? Banke and Soren Jessing are adamant 
that a 40 kWh (effective)/700 volt battery pack is essential for this 
application, as opposed to using a 96 volt option.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Research shows battery pack life of more than 2500 cycles using LiFePo4 
battery technology. The Banke system uses a 400 volt PM (permanent magnet) 
motor with variable RPM control - which is 60% lighter than some competitive 
designs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The system has enough power to lift up to 1200 containers per battery pack 
charge - all within a modular package just 456 mm long, 2500 mm wide and 2000 
mm high. This 'pod' fits between truck can and compaction body of most waste 
collection vehicles with minimal loss of body length and an increase in unladen 
weight of just 950 kg. The batteries are designed to be chargeable (by a simple 
domestic plug) within four hours - useful when using cheaper off-peak power and 
essential if a double shift pattern is to be used in future. The charger is 
built-in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And? Another interesting thing about The Lean Energy Cluster approach is 
that it lends itself to new partners being added, together with local assembly 
within the growing economies - thus creating new jobs and saving energy in 
waste collection and recycling on a global basis.</p>
