<p><strong>From Green Right Now Reports</strong></p> 
<p>King County Metro in Seattle has ordered up to 500 diesel-electric hybrid 
buses from Daimler Buses North America. The first year order includes 93

<p>Daimler says the first Orion VII diesel-electric hybrids will be delivered 
to Seattle beginning in mid-2010.</p> 
<p>With the latest orders, Daimler Buses says it will have a total of more 
than 2,900 diesel-electric hybrid transit buses in revenue service or on order 
for various transit authorities throughout the U.S. and Canada &ndash; making 
it the largest hybrid provider worldwide.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Daimler remains committed to promoting clean drive technologies 
which will shape future transportation,&rdquo; Andreas Strecker, president and 
CEO of Daimler Buses North America, said in a statement. &ldquo;These 
additional orders for the Orion VII diesel-electric hybrid bus further maintain 
Daimler&rsquo;s position as the world&rsquo;s hybrid bus leader &ndash; a 
position that we intend to retain through product excellence and continued 
innovative firsts.&rdquo;</p>
