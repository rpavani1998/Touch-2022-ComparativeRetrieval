<h1>Barbecue &amp; Grilling Books</h1> 
<h2><strong>Weber's Real Grilling by Jamie Purviance </strong></h2> 
<p><em>Sunset, 2001, $24.95, 305 pages, paperback, more than 200 recipes, 
perhaps 300 color superb photos.</em></p> 
<p>This beautiful book has 305 large pages with more than 200 recipes and 
perhaps 300 superb color photos. Purviance begins with managing the grill, and 
although Weber's grills are featured, the advice is broad enough to cover most 
charcoal and gas grills. Shockingly, there is nary a mention of theWeber Smokey 
Mountain, considered by many to be the best bullet smoker on the market, and 
winner of a Meathead's Gold Award. So, although there are several smoked meat 
recipes, they are all cooked on the Weber Kettle or a gas grill. You can cook 
barbecue on grills and braziers, but a specialty smoker is a better tool for 
the job.</p> 
<p>Then it's off to describing tools and accessories, ingredients, and a 
chapter on rubs, marinades, and sauces. Despite the omission of a real smoker 
in the book, if you want some superb, contemporary as well as traditional 
outdoor meal recipes, this is the book to buy. Purviance is a witty fellow, and 
his text is fun reading. Not surprising, his cooking instructions are precise 
and easy to follow. He knows his food.</p> 
<p>As good as the text is, I must spend a minute praising the photographer, 
Tim Turner. His work has made this the most beautiful book on barbecue and 
grilling on the market. The lighting, the composition, color, are all superb. 
You really get a sense of what the dish could look like (but of course we both 
know it never looks as good as the photos).</p> 
<h2>Weber's Time to Grill by Jamie Purviance</h2> 
<p><em>Sunset, 2011, $24.95, 300 pages, paperback, 200 plus recipes, superb 
color photos for most.</em></p> 
<p>Chef Purviance has another winner for Weber. This one has the 200 plus 
recipes divided into two categories, &quot;Easy&quot; and 
&quot;Adventurous&quot;, pretty much 50/50, and you don't need a Weber to cook 
them. They are all spectacularly photographed by Tim Turner.</p> 
<p>Everything is neatly organized from rubs to marinades to appetizers to 
desserts (yes grilled desserts) with color coded sections, icons of fish and 
pigs, etc., and flaps on both front and back covers to bookmark pages. In 
addition, there are several useful references to cooking temps and times, and a 
great section called &quot;prep school&quot; with step by step photos of how to 
cut up onions and peppers, devein shrimp, butterflying a chicken, and more.</p> 
<h2>Big Bob Gibson's BBQ Book: Recipes and Secrets from a Legendary Barbecue 
Joint by Chris Lilly</h2> 
<p><em>Clarkson Potter, 2009, $24.99, 256 pages, paperback, many recipes, many 
beautiful color and B&amp;W photos.</em></p> 
<p>Chris Lilly is the Executive Chef of one of the nation's classic old 
joints, Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q, in Decatur, AL. He is also the head of the 
restaurant's much decorated competition team, winner of more championships than 
he can count. Surprisingly thin with a pointy chin and piercing eyes, his 
angularity is significantly softened by his drawl.</p> 
<p>Most barbecue chefs have a pretty small repertoire, limited to the classic 
Southern barbecue canon, ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, sausage, and 
sides like beans, cornbread, and slaw. Yes, they're all there in this superb 
book, but Lilly also includes fun riffs on Caribbean Jerk Pork, Bacon Wrapped 
Shrimp, and beyond. There is also a version of Big Bob's famous white chicken 
sauce, but he clearly felt restrained from giving away the restaurant's secret 
recipe, and frankly, I thinkmy reverse engineering of the ingredients comes 
closer to the real deal.</p> 
<p>Lilly is a fine story teller, and he shares with us what it is like to work 
at a small town barbecue joint, as well as the fascinating legend of Big Bob 
and his family all the way back to 1925.</p> 
<p>The photos by Ben Fink are rich and rustic, and it's a shame he is only 
mentioned in small type in the back of the book. He deserves cover credit. The 
images really make the recipes look worth cooking and make Big Bob's look like 
a destination. Likewise the historic images give the reader a real sense of the 
heritage of the recipes.</p> 
<p>I have one other nit to pick, and that's the table of contents, which 
contains only chapter titles and not a listing of the stories and recipes. If 
classic Southern Barbecue is your goal, this is the one book you need.</p> 
<h2><strong>The Cook's Illustrated Guide to Grilling and Barbecue, A Practical 
Guide For the Outdoor Cook </strong></h2> 
<p><em>America's Test Kitchen, 2005, $35, 420 pages, hardbound, more than 450 
recipes, many B&amp;W photos and excellent line drawings, 28 color photos.</em>
</p> 
<p>As I have exclaimed perhaps too often and too breathlessly elsewhere on 
this site,<em>Cook's Illustrated</em>, the magazine, the website, the book 
publisher, and producer of America's Test Kitchen on PBS, is my favorite source 
for no-nonsense, thoroughly tested info. The editors take little for granted 
and they are constantly questioning and testing accepted wisdom and wives' 
tales. And these folks really understand barbecue.</p> 
<p>Here's a sampling: &quot;Ounce for ounce, hardwood lump charcoal burns much 
hotter than briquets. However, the differences are less dramatic when the coals 
are measured by volume. (Because of their shape, briquets compact more easily 
so you can fit more coals into the same amount of space.) For all practical 
purposes, a heaping chimney of charcoal briquets will make a fire that is as 
hot as a level chimney of hardwood lump charcoal. So if you need to substitute 
briquets for hardwood, use slightly more briquets to achieve the same heat 
level.&quot; They then show a chart of equivalent volumes.</p> 
<p>The limited illustrations are mostly high quality black and white pen 
drawings with a handful of beautiful large color plates scattered throughout.

<h2>Serious Barbecue: Smoke, Char, Baste, and Brush Your Way to Great Outdoor 
Cooking by Adam Perry Lang</h2> 
<p><em>Hyperion, 2009, $35, 400 pages, hardcover, many recipes, many color 
photos.</em></p> 
<p>Perry Lang is a serious classically trained chef, a veteran of Le Cirque 
and Daniel, and, as the proprietor of Daisy May's BBQ USA in NYC and as a 
competitor on the barbecue circuit, he knows a lot about barbecue. The recipes 
are creative, insightful, and beautifully photographed.</p> 
<h2>How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques by 
Steve Raichlen</h2> 
<p><em>Workman, 2001, $20.95, 498 pages, paperback, many recipes, many color 
photos.</em></p> 
<p>Nobody knows more about barbecue than Steven Raichlen. This author has had 
a greater influence on the meteoric growth in popularity of barbecue in the US 
than anyone since George Stephen invented the Weber kettle grill in 1951. With 
several other books on barbecue and grilling (see below), a cooking school, two 
television series, a lecture tour, and a line of outdoor cooking tools, 
Raichlen has had the kind of influence on men who cook, that Julia Child had on 
women who cook. This book won an IACP award.</p> 
<p>Ten years old, this book comes closest to my concept than any other. 
However, it is out of date. For example there is no mention of pellet grills, 
the niftiest new technology in grilling since the propane grill. Food science 
(some of it my original research) has since debunked several popular myths in 
this book. My book will be better organized, more instructional, and less 
recipe driven.</p> 
<h2>Planet Barbecue! by Steve Raichlen</h2> 
<p><em>Workman, 2010, $22.95, 638 pages, paperback, many recipes, many color 
photos.</em></p> 
<p>Beautifully photographed in color, this book won a Julia Child Cookbook 
Award. Raichlen's most recent book, it is the best of his five barbecue books. 
He visits 60 countries and brings back recipes for everything from Spanish 
chocolate sandwiches to kangaroo. He begins with the history of barbecue, and 
the last small chapter covers different grill types and how to use them. 
Discussion of concepts and technique are scattered throughout this huge book in 
the methods for individual recipes.</p> 
<h2><strong>The Barbecue! Bible by Steven Raichlen </strong></h2> 
<p><em>Workman, 2003, $21.95, 774 pages, paperback, 425 recipes, many sepia 
tone B&amp;W photos.</em></p> 
<p>The Barbecue! Bible was Raichlen's first book on the subject. Published in 
1998, this 556 page tome with 500 recipes covers everything from hamburgers to 
bread. The illustrations are little more than black and white clip art. Cute, 
but not very educational, and there is no depiction of what the finished 
product looks like.</p> 
<h2><strong>BBQ USA by Steven Raichlen </strong></h2> 
<p>This is my favorite of Raichlen's books. Published in 2003, it is a 
whopping 774 pages with 425 recipes. He begins with a history of barbecue that 
is fun and enlightening. Then there is a primer on grilling and barbecue with 
lots of great tips. Most of the recipes come from restaurants, from joints to 
white tablecloth temples of food. There are more useful tips and fun facts in 
the sidebars. I love the sepia toned photos of pitmasters and plain folk 
cooking, but I'd love to see some color photos of the finished products.</p> 
<p>Here's a typical passage: &quot;A great deal of ink, beer, and maybe even 
blood have been spilled over the great debate: charcoal or gas,&quot; he 
starts. He praises the convenience of gas grills, and then tells us &quot;If I 
could use only one grill for the rest of my life (or take it to a deserted 
island), it would be my trusty charcoal kettle. Why? For starters, charcoal 
burns hotter than gas, so it sears better (better searing makes for bolder 
flavors). It's also easier to smoke on a charcoal grill. Charcoal imparts a 
distinct flavor all its own, one that's less pronounced that that from grilling 
over a wood fire (which, by the way, is easy to build on a charcoal grill), but 
definitely more discernible than what you get from gas. And, of course, 
charcoal gives you the thrill of playing with fire.&quot;</p> 
<p>Raichlen sums this book's concept up with this quote: &quot;When I grew up, 
barbecue meant the main course. Today, we grill everything, and I mean 
everything from appetizers to desserts.&quot;</p> 
<h2><strong>Barbecue! Bible Sauces, Rubs, and Marinades by Steven Raichlen 
</strong></h2> 
<p><em>Workman, 1998, $22.95, 556 pages, 500 recipes, only a few B&amp;W 
illustrations and photos.</em></p> 
<p>The BBQ guru with the oval sunglasses and denim shirt dishes up more than 
200 savory liquids to soak your food in or slather on it. A wide range of 
creative flavors from around the world.</p> 
<h2><strong>Peace, Love, and Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and 
Outright Lies from the Legends of Barbecue by Mike Mills and Amy Mills 
Tunnicliffe </strong></h2> 
<p><em>Rodale, 2005, $23, 312 pages, paperback, numerous recipes, numerous 
B&amp;W photos.</em></p> 
<p>Mike &quot;The Legend&quot; Mills has earned his nickname with achievements 
as a restaurateur (17th Street Bar and Grill in Southern Illinois and four 
Memphis Championship Barbecue restaurants in Las Vegas), an award-winning chef 
(three-rime Grand World Champion at Memphis in May), president of the National 
Barbecue Association (2004-2005), and now, with the help of his daughter 
(herself an accomplished chef, writer, and photographer), he has created a 
classic in the pantheon of barbecue literature. Peace, Love, and Barbecue, 
published in 2005, not only contains the expected count of excellent recipes 
and cooking tips, but includes interviews with the legends of barbecue, and 
visits to the &quot;shrines, shacks, joints, and right respectable 
restaurants.&quot; This is a first rate reference and a fun read.</p> 
<p>Here's a quote: &quot;I never told either of my wives the recipe [for our 
secret family barbecue sauce]. Let me tell you, this didn't set well with 
either one of them. I have had it in my head, so it isn't written down 
anywhere. It's not as thou they could've found it in the recipe box.</p> 
<p>&quot;My first marriage lasted only seven years, so keeping a secret wasn't 
too much of a problem, although Wife #1 wasn't amused. Marriage to Wife #2 
lasted for only 27 years, so she didn't make the cut either. Now if we'd made 
it to 30 years, I might've broken down and spilled my guts. But she would've 
had to change her ways.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Low &amp; Slow: Mastering the Art of Barbecue in Five Easy Lessons by Gary 
Wiviott</h2> 
<p><em>Running Press, 2009, $19.95, 256 pages, paperback, no photos, only a 
few illustrations.</em></p> 
<p>If you have a new Weber Smoky Mountain smoker you absolutely positively 
must buy Gary Wiviott's book. Although not specific to this cooker, nobody 
knows more about it than Wiv, and his step by step guides can be applied to a 
wide range of low and slow devices.</p> 
<p>He is a purist, and Chapter 8, titled &quot;Master the Art of Barbecue on a 
Gas or Electric Grill&quot; has just one page that says &quot;Gotcha! Shame on 
you for even thinking it. You cannot make low and slow barbecue on a gas or 
electric grill.&quot; And that's all he wrote. Well, he's right about 
electrics, butif you follow my tips on how to set up your gas grill, you can 
make darn fine low and slow barbecue on it. Wiviott, who is extremely 
knowledgeable about food, may seem dogmatic in his tutorial, but if you follow 
his procedures you will be richly rewarded.</p> 
<h2>Kansas City Barbeque Society Cookbook Edited by Ardie A. Davis, Chef Paul 
Kirk, and Carolyn Wells</h2> 
<p><em>Andrews McMeel, 2010, $24.99, 318 pages, hardcover, more than 200 
recipes, many color photos.</em></p> 
<p>Pure fun. Founded in 1986, the Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS) is an 
international association with thousands of members. They sanction and 
administer more than 400 barbecue competitions.</p> 
<p>The intro material is about the history of KCBS and how the judging works. 
The recipes were all contributed by members, and the photos are all amateur 
snapshots which give the book a friendly family album feel. There are short 
bios of the contributors, sidebars with short tips, a glossary in the rear, and 
only three pages of bullet-pointed cooking tips.</p> 
<p>I would give this book a gold medal, but, because the recipes come from so 
many sources, and many are scaled down from restaurant quantities, there is a 
lot inconsistency in the recipe presentation. I am sure the cooks have 
perfected them, but the best cookbooks use recipe testers to double check and 
polish, and editors to make sure everything is consistent and easy to 
understand, and that is not the case here.</p> 
<h2>Fire it Up, More Than 400 Recipes for Grilling Everything by Andrew 
Schloss and David Joachim</h2> 
<p><em>Chronicle Books, 2011, $24.95, paperback, 416 pages, more than 400 
recipes, many beautiful photos.</em></p> 
<p>A big, heavy, beautifully photographed book that feels authoritative. The 
intro material is short, but high quality. It emphasizes creative recipes and 
has large sections on fish and veggies for folks who don't eat meat. On the 
other hand, many recipes call for hard-to-find ingredients such as elk, lamb 
kidneys, agave, epazote, etc. Not easy to find at the local grocery. Sure wish 
the type wasn't so small.</p> 
<h2><strong>Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue Sauces: 175 Make-Your-Own 
Sauces, Marinades, Dry Rubs, Wet Rubs, Mops, and Salsas </strong></h2> 
<p>Paul Kirk is known as the Baron of Barbecue. He teaches classes in barbecue 
and, as a competition cook, has won more awards than can be counted. This book 
has 175 sauces, marinades, dry rubs, wet rubs, mops, and salsas. Nothing fancy, 
no long-winded tales and stories, just tried and true recipes, mostly from his 
buddies on the competition circuit. He's not the best writer, but he has a lot 
to teach.</p> 
<p>Here's a quote: &quot;People ask me what is the most important aspect of 
barbecue: the rub, cooker, smoker, fire, wood, charcoal, meat, what? All things 
being equal, my answer is without a doubt the rub or barbecue seasoning! If you 
have good rub, your chances of being the neighborhood Barbecue King, or this 
year's big winner in barbecue competitions, are very good. The next thing 
people usually want to know is what's in my rub and whether I'll give out my 
recipe. My answer is, sure, you can have what's in my rub, but I won't give you 
the proportions. My rub consists of sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder, pepper, 
and other spices.&quot;</p> 
<h2><strong>Steak Lover's Cookbook by William Rice </strong></h2> 
<p>A former columnist for the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and editor of 
Food &amp; Wine magazine, Bill Rice is one of the great food writers of our 
time. In this 246 page book he teaches us how to come close to great steakhouse 
porterhouse steaks with the classic accompaniments like creamed spinach and 
steak fries. He teaches us how to buy steaks, store them, prep them, carve 
them, cook them outdoors, cook them indoors, how to season them, garnish them, 
and what to serve with them. The beef recipes range from stewed to stuffed, 
fajitas, curry, orange beef, and even pot roast. The sides include mango 
guacamole, chicken liver pate, gazpacho, fried zucchini, cowboy beans, apple 
Stilton cole slaw; and the desserts include a grilled dessert pizza, cobbler, 
mud pie, and bread pudding.</p> 
<p>A quote: &quot;Do not try to dry-age steak in your home. Only large primal 
and sub-primal cuts are suitable to the process. The bacteria that will collect 
on a single steak could cause illness. Keep fresh steak in the refrigerator, 
well wrapped, for no more than four days. If you choose to freeze uncooked 
steak, do it under the coldest temperature possible because the faster it 
freezes the less fluid loss there will be when you thaw it.&quot;</p> 
<h2><strong>The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas </strong></h2> 
<p>Is there anything that bacon doesn't enhance? Yes, even that is enhanced by 
bacon. This paean to pork bellies is a winner. The standards such as quiche, 
carbonarra, BLT, are there among 168 intriguing recipes by an experienced 
cookbook author, including chocolate truffles with peanut butter and bacon, 
bacon Parmesan biscuits, cauliflower with bacon and pimento, conch and bacon 
stew, peppered bacon cornbread, Maryland crab and bacon chowder, bacon wrapped 
salmon, and a whole bunch of stews and salads. Only one complaint. No bacon ice 
cream. Yes, there is such a thing, I have seen the recipe, and people I know 
who have tasted it say it is the perfect dessert. He also explains how bacon is 
made, defines all the different kinds of bacons, tells us how to buy bacon, and 
tells us about some of the best artisan bacon makin' places.</p> 
<p>A quote &quot;Virtually all bacon is cured, but not all bacon is smoked... 
Smoking not only imparts more flavor to the bacon but also enhances the curing 
process and renders some of the fat. Smoking methods vary enormously from one 
craftsman to the next, but most American and European Artisinal producers smoke 
their cured sides of bacon naturally and slowly in smokehouses over wood logs 
or chips (hickory, applewood, oak, cherry, maple, beach) or dried corncobs, a 
time-consuming technique that can last up to a week or longer for double-smoked 
bacon. Giant commercial companies can either smoke their bacons with sawdust in 
stainless-steel smokers for four to six hours or simply inject the meat with 
liquid smoke. Since long smoking partially cooks bacon and reduces fat content, 
a pound of raw artisinal bacon yields about three-quarters of a pound cooked, 
whereas more ordinary, quick-smoked bacon produces as little as a quarter to a 
third. The ideal result of long, careful smoking is a dense bacon with firm, 
smooth fat and dark to mahogany lean meat; one that does not shrink excessively 
in the frying pan; and one that delivers just the right rich balance of meat 
and crackling fat and a mellow smoky flavor.&quot;</p> 
<h2>America's Best BBQ by Ardie A. Davis and Chef Paul Kirk</h2> 
<p><em>Andrews McMeel, 2009, $19.99, 224 pages, paperback, 100 recipes, 
hundreds of color photos.</em></p> 
<p>This wholly wonderful book is meant as a cookbook, as described in the 
subtitle &quot;100 Recipes from America's Best Smokehouses, Pits, Shacks, Rib 
Joints, Roadhouses, and Restaurants&quot;. But it is much more. Davis and Kirk 
probably have visited more barbecue joints than anyone I know, and they know 
the good stuff from the bad. For this book they have picked some of the best 
barbecue restaurants, describe them, and share a recipe. Davis and Kirk are not 
professional photographers, but their snapshots do a fine job of conveying the 
ambiance of the restaurants, the personalities of the people, and the taste of 
the food. I have used it more than once as a reference when I hit the road, and 
they have never steered me wrong.</p> 
<p>The narrative is folksy and personal. Here they are discussing pig snoot 
sandwiches: &quot;Ardie hasn't made it through a whole snoot sandwich yet, even 
after downing a shot of Pig's Nose Scotch first. Paul downs them with gusto 
reminiscent of a New Yorker eating clams or oysters on the half shellArdie says 
they taste like bacon fat with barnyard rub. When he gets to the whiskers, he 
stops and orders a tenderloin sandwich or a cheeseburger.&quot; Yes, they offer 
a recipe that even Ardie will eat.</p> 
<h2><strong>Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook: Recipes and Recollections from 
the Pit Bosses by Robb Walsh </strong></h2> 
<p><em>Chronicle Books, 2002, $18.95, 269 pages, paperback, plenty of 
traditional recipes, scores of B&amp;W photos, but not of the recipes.</em></p> 
<p>This book is a wonderful piece of scholarly research that is also a great 
read. Walsh has delved into the history and lore of Texas barbecue, it origins, 
its ingredients, its personalities, and its tall tales. He recommends the best 
places to eat when in the Lone Star State, what to eat, and provides recipes 
from pitmasters to help you replicate the real thing at home. Even the photos 
are fascinating.</p> 
<p>A quote: &quot;The majority of Texas barbecue joints now serve a little bit 
of everything. You'll always find some kind of beef offered, and usually 
German-style sausage along with Southern-style pork with barbecue sauce, 
Mexican tortillas, West Texas beans, and sides from all over the place. Not to 
mention banana pudding, coconut cake, and sweet potato pie. Some places try to 
maintain a degree of stylistic purity, but few succeed. That's why when you say 
&quot;Texas barbecue,&quot; no one can ever be sure about what you are talking 
about... The best way to preserve our tradition is to constantly disagree about 
what Texas barbecue really is.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Dr. BBQ's Big-Time Barbecue Cookbook</h2> 
<p><em>St. Martin's Griffin, 2005, $16.95, paperback, 302 pages, many recipes, 
about 50 B&amp;W photos.</em></p> 
<p>Very few people know barbecue and grilling like Ray Lampe and he's got a 
room full of trophies to prove it. The former truck driver from the Chicago are 
writes just as he speaks, friendly, unassuming, and with an understated wit. 
Nothing snobby about Dr. BBQ. His tips on technique and tools are scattered 
throughout the book. Here he is talking about Wisconsin Bratwurst, cooked the 
&quot;right way&quot;: &quot;This is a subject I have researched for many 
years. Like much of my research, it involves me, a grill, a lawn chair, and a 
cooler of beer.&quot; He then wanders off into a lament on how his favorite 
beer, Old Style, changed when it went from being made in Lacrosse, WI, to when 
it was bought out by a big corporation. Then he gets around to the recipe. This 
much we can be sure of. His recipes will work.</p> 
<h2>Grilling by The Culinary Institute of America</h2> 
<p><em>Lebhar-Friedman, 2006, $35, 229 pages, hardcover, 175 recipes, 100 
color photos.</em></p> 
<p>Mostly recipes, no doubt well tested, although some are surprisingly vague 
for the nation's premium culinary college. &quot;cook over medium heat&quot; is 
not very specific and not very helpful to the novice. Instead, how about 
&quot;cook at 300&deg;F&quot;, if that's what you mean, chefs? There is a small 
intro chapter on grills and grilling, safety, etc. Some tips on technique 
scattered throughout. Clearly this book was thrown together from their database 
and is not a complete entity. Photos, however, are scrumptious.</p> 
<h2><strong>Barbecue: A Texas Love Story</strong></h2> 
<p>A 46 minute DVD narrated by the late Governor Ann Richards and directed by 
Chris Elley. This clever 2005 documentary features some of the characters and 
culture of Texas barbecue including the Sowpremes (women who dress like hogs 
and root for barbecue), and Kinky Friedman (novelist, humorist, former 
candidate for governor, songwriter, and leader of the band Kinky Friedman and 
the Texas Jewboys). &quot;Jesus loved barbecue. That's well known,&quot; 
asserts Friedman.</p> 
<h2><strong>Barbecue Secrets, Unbeatable Recipes, Tips &amp; Tricks From a 
Barbecue Champion by Ron Shewchuk </strong></h2> 
<p>Shewchuk is a Vancouver based competitor who really knows his stuff. This 
is a good beginner's guide to serious barbecue with many of his competition 
recipes. Unfortunately there are only two recipes for ribs. One is called 
&quot;Cheater ribs&quot; for people in a hurry, and it involves boiling water. 
This oversight is balanced by the quality of the other recipe for ribs and his 
great advice on everything from brisket to smoked duck salad. Ingredients are 
measured in both standard English measurements (pounds, cups, tablespoons, 
Fahrenheit) as well as metric (kilograms, liters, Centigrade).</p> 
<p>From a section called &quot;All I ever needed to know, I learned from 
barbecue&quot; here's a quote: &quot;Think of what a better world it would be 
if we all, the whole world, had barbecue and peach daiquiris about 3 o'clock 
every afternoon and then lay down for a nap with a bag of charcoal for a 
pillow.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Startin' the Fire by George Hensler</h2> 
<p>George Hensler is the captain of a barbecue team, and he has written a very 
helpful short book on what you need to know before entering your first Kansas 
City Barbecue Society (KCBS) contest.</p> 
<p>Startin' the Fire is informative, friendly, funny, and conversational, with 
a real homespun feel. There are 29 chapters in the 99 pages with titles such as 
Team Building, Selecting a Team Name, Transportation, Equipment Selection, Site 
Safety, Box Building 101, and more.</p> 
<h2>25 Essentials: Techniques for Grilling Fish by Karen Adler &amp; Judith 
Fertig</h2> 
<p>This pretty, little, inexpensive, spiral bound cookbook explains the simple 
guidelines for grilling seafood beautifully. The authors, widely known as the 
BBQ Queens, do a nice job of classifying many popular fish as &quot;Firm 
Texture&quot;, &quot;Moderately Firm Texture&quot; and &quot;Delicate 
Texture&quot; so you know what you've got going in.</p> 
<p>Because the techniques for most different fish are similar, there are only 
25 recipes, but they are solid, and almost all have a sauce, dressing, or 
marinade than can easily be copied and pasted to other fish. Lovely photos, too.
</p> <br>

<h1>Hot Dogs and Hamburgers</h1> 
<h2>Hot Dog: A Global History by Bruce Kraig</h2> 
<p>A well regarded culinary historian and Professor Emeritus of History and 
Humanities at Roosevelt University in Chicago. Scholarly yet clever and 
entertaining, Kraig probably knows more about the history of the hot dog than 
anyone and he meticulously dismissed the many myths about the origin of the 
frankfurter, the bun, and its name. He does a good job of explaining how hot 
dog culture spanned the nation and even the world.</p> 
<h2>The Great American Hot Dog Book by Becky Mercuri</h2> 
<p>Up to date on the latest historical research, a fun read, and fascinating 
profiles of the iconographic hot dog stands around the nation with recipes from 
most.</p> 
<h2>The Hot Dog Companion by David Graulich</h2> 
<p>Entertainingly written, well researched, contains a good history, profiles 
local legends, describes how a dog is made, and cooking tips. No recipes.</p> 
<h2>Hamburgers &amp; Fries: An American Story by John T. Edge</h2> 
<p>Culinary historian, John T. Edge is a fun read. This book follows him cross 
country as he seeks regional styles and historical techniques that will help 
him unravel the story of the All-American hamburger. Here he describes his 
encounter with Jucy Lucy at Matt's in Minneapolis, MN: &quot;The burger at 
bottom right begins to wobble, ballooning outward and then quaking like a 
capsized turtle. Remember Alien? It's not unlike that. If you missed Sigourney 
Weaver's money shot, I'll be more precise: it's as if something is trapped 
inside that burger; it's as if something wants out.</p> 
<p>&quot;Finally a minor geyser erupts, a thin stream of cheese spouting 
upward in a textbook exhibition of fluid dynamics. I hear a treble-register 
swish, an exhalation. And I watch as a blob of cheese exits the side of the 
burger... I learn from a woman two stools down that I have just witnessed what 
Jucy Lucy cultists know as a blowout.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Hamburger: A Global History by Andy Smith</h2> 
<p>Culinary historian Andy Smith is a thorough researcher. I once attended a 
seminar he did on researching cultural history through food and was blown away 
by his thoroughness and the tricks of his trade. This definitive little book 
unwraps the mystery of the origin of the hamburger and its name, and traces its 
spread across the globe. The stories of White Castle, McDonald's, and other 
chains and Mom &amp; Pop burger stands is worth the modest price of admission. 
He debunks the myths that the Tartars invented hamburgers, that they first 
appeared on a menu at Delmonico's in NYC in 1834, that Ray Kroc founded 
McDonald's, and that the first Mickey D's is in Desplaines, IL. All untrue.</p> 
<h2>Hamburger America: One Man's Cross-Country Odyssey to Find the Best 
Burgers in the Nation [Book &amp; DVD] by George Motz</h2> 
<p>George Motz has traveled the four corners of the nation to find the best 
and most interesting burger joints. Many are cultural and community icons, and 
Motz interviews the owners, writes about their burgers, and photographs the 
places beautifully.</p> 
<h2>The Hamburger: A History by Josh Ozersky</h2> 
<p>A cleverly written, well researched, fun tale of the history of the 
hamburger and how it has evolved in step with American culture. Ozersky, a 
writer for TIME magazine, is an insightful and witty fellow, capable of 
connecting the rise of McDonald's with the fact that &quot;Conformity, it will 
be rememered, was a serious social issue in the 1950s.&quot; He does a good job 
of dispelling a few myths, and puts the achievements of such giants as Ray Kroc 
and Dave Thomas in perspective. There are no recipe or evencooking tips in this 
book, just a look at how this iconic American sandwich is America and America 
is a hamburger.</p> <br>

<h1>Books All Cooks Should Own</h1> 
<h2><strong>On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen by Harold 
McGee </strong></h2> 
<p>If you want to know why we do what we do in the kitchen, not just what to 
do or how to do it, this fat tome is a must have. It is a fascinating and easy 
to read textbook that explains what food is made of, and how it reacts with 
heat and other foods. McGee describes scores of different kinds of foods and 
their characteristics as well as every cooking method and how it changes the 
food. The meticulous black and white pen and ink illustrations are 
illuminating, and if you have the technical bent, the molecular drawings will 
give you the real nitty gritty. This book belongs in every kitchen.</p> 
<p>Here's a typical passage: &quot;Get down on all fours and 'graze,' and 
you'll notice that the neck, shoulders, chest, and front limbs all work hard 
while the back is more relaxed... Tenderloin is appropriately named because it 
is a single muscle with little connective tissue that runs along the back and 
gets little action; it's tender.&quot;Here's something more technical: 
&quot;The basic texture of meat, dense and firm, comes from the mass of muscle 
fibers, which cooking makes denser, dryer, and tougher. And the elongated 
arrangement accounts for the 'grain' of the meat. Cut parallel to the bundles 
and you see them from the side, lined up like logs of a cabin wall; cut across 
the bundles and you see just the ends. It's easier to push fiber bundles apart 
from each other than to break the bundles themselves, so it's easier to chew 
along the direction of the fibers than across them. We usually carve across the 
grain, so that we can chew with the grain.&quot; And here's my favorite tip. He 
tells us how to have a safe rare hamburger! He explains that rare hamburger is 
dangerous because fecal contamination can get on the surface of the meat, and 
it then gets mixed in as the meat is ground. When you cook a rare steak the 
surface is sterilized, but when you grind meat, the interior can be 
contaminated because the surface is mixed into the interior. So here's his 
solution: &quot;Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, immerse [unground 
pieces of meat] in the water for 30-60 seconds, then remove, drain and pat dry, 
and grind in a scrupulously clean meat grinder.&quot;</p> 
<h2>The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan</h2> 
<p>This may be the most important book about food since Upton Sinclair's The 
Jungle drew back the curtain on the Chicago stockyards in 1906. Both books take 
an analytical and critical look at how food gets to our table. The New York 
Times named The Omnivore's Dilemma one of the 10 best books of 2006.</p> 
<p>Pollan documents in fascinating detail how food and feed are grown, how 
government influences what we eat, and how what we eat influences our health, 
our environment, our politics, and our humanity.</p> 
<p>He begins by reminding those of us old enough to remember that a cross 
country trip in the 1970s meant the strobe of farms populated with horses, beef 
cattle, dairy cattle, chickens, pigs, a seasonal vegetable, and fruit trees. 
Now such a trip reveals unbroken rows of corn and soybeans, monotonous 
&quot;monocultures.&quot; Corn, it seems, has subsumed everything beginning 
with some innocent sounding decisions by the Nixon administration, and it now 
is the vast industry whose by-products find their way into 25% of the products 
in the packaged goods in the grocery store. It is in all the animals we eat, 
and just about everything we eat with them. It is even in the toothpaste we use 
to clean up after. &quot;Tell me what you eat,&quot; said Brillat-Savarin, 
&quot;and I will tell you what you are.&quot; We are corn.</p> 
<p>He goes on to demonstrate how corn has allowed a handful of politically 
powerful huge multinational conglomerates to control pricing of almost all farm 
products and have driven calories per acre yields to incredible records while 
driving the profit per acre for the farmer to the point of bankruptcy.</p> 
<p>He shows how the quest for cheap calories has impacted our diets and the 
far reaching impact on everything including our health care system. He shows 
the relationship of our dependance on corn on our dependance on foreign oil, 
and I'm not talking corn oil.</p> 
<p>His descriptions of the confined feedlot operations (CFOs) on which cattle 
are fattened for slaughter are revelatory. But he is not just another food 
Nazi. Some of his greatest surprises are found in his section describing the 
organic food industry and how far it has strayed from its roots.</p> 
<p>In the final chapter, he hunts wild hog and enters into a tortured debate 
with himself over the morality and the benefits and disadvantages of eating 
meat. He asks all the right questions, and quotes positions of proponents of 
many of the various positions. It is one of the most informed unbiased debates 
I have seen on the topic.</p> 
<p>Pollan is insightful, thoughtful, deadly serious without being pedantic 
(well, just a little), and occasionally witty.</p> 
<p>There are some slow spots in the book, but the first 200 pages are 
riveting. This is a must read for people who love food, love the commonwealth, 
and wonder what the future holds.</p> 
<h2>Food Rules: An Eater's Manual by Michael Pollan</h2> 
<p>A short paperback that you can easily swallow on a short airplane trip, 
Pollan, the author of such important books as the Ominvore's Dilemma (above), 
In Defense of Food, and The Botany of Desire, summarizes what he has learned 
about good eating habits in the form of &quot;rules&quot; which he describes in 
a few sentences. A sampling:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize as food.</li> 
<li>Avoid food products that make health claims.</li> 
<li>Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle.</li> 
<li>If you have the space, buy a freezer.</li> 
<li>Eat like an omnivore.</li> 
<li>Have a glass of wine with dinner.</li> 
<li>Stop eating before you're full.</li> 
<li>Buy small plates and glasses.</li> 
<li>Don't get your fuel from the same place your car does.</li> </ul> 
<p>He summarizes the whole book perfectly in one rule &quot;Eat food. Not too 
much. Mostly plants.&quot;</p> 
<h2><strong>The Meat Buyers Guide: Meat, Lamb, Veal, Pork and Poultry by NAMP 
(North American Meat Processors Association) </strong></h2> 
<p>This is the definitive reference on all the different cuts of meat, with 
charts, excellent photos, a glossary, and nutritional info. It is aimed at 
butchers, chefs, and ranchers, but a home chef can learn a lot.</p> 
<p>A quote: &quot;Spareribs shall consist of at least 11 ribs and associated 
coastal cartilages and may include portions of the sternum and diaphragm. The 
membranous portion of the diaphragm, close to the lean, and any portion of the 
diaphragm not firmly attached close to the inside surface of the ribs, shall be 
excluded. The lean shall not extend more than 2.0 inches (5.0 cm) past the 
curvature of the last rib and coastal cartilage. Heart fat on the inside 
surface of the ribs shall not exceed 0.25 inch (6 mm) average depth. Leaf fat 
shall be trimmed practically free from the diaphragm and transverse 
abdominis.&quot; OK. So it's a bit technical. But don't let this deter you if 
you really want to learn about meat. The charts and pictures are worth the 
price alone.</p> 
<h2>Whole Beast Butchery: The Complete Visual Guide to Beef, Lamb, and Pork by 
Ryan Farr with Brigit Binns</h2> 
<p><em>Chronicle, 2011, $40, 239 pages, 15 recipes, hundreds of color photos.
</em></p> 
<p>Farr is a classically trained chef, butcher, and butchery instructor, at 
his 4505 Meats in San Francisco. In three chapters, Beef, Pork, and Lamb, he 
demonstrates his craft in hundreds of photographs. Each chapter is followed by 
five recipes without photos.</p> 
<p>The photos are action shots showing us how he butchers carcasses rather 
than the carefully posed and retouched photos in Kari Underly's book (below) 
where the end product is emphasized. Oddly, perhaps to make raw meat look less 
slippery and red than it really is, the images aren't color corrected very well 
so there is an old-fashioned hue to them.</p> 
<p>The publisher promotes an app for the book, whic I suspect will be better 
than the book if there is video. Alas, it is not available at this time 
(11/27/2011).</p> 
<h2>The Art of Beef Cutting: A Meat Professional's Guide to Butchering and 
Merchandising by Kari Underly</h2> 
<p><em>Wiley, 2011, $50, 232 pages, no recipes, spiral bound hardback, 
numerous color photos.</em></p> 
<p>The best teachers can address the novice and still educate the expert, and 
that is exactly what Kari Underly does in this fine guide. Aimed at protein 
pros, this book belongs on the shelves of any serious carnivore.</p> 
<p>Underly is a third generation butcher and consultant to numerous merchants, 
universities, chefs, farmers, and trade associations, among them the National 
Cattlemen's Beef Association.</p> 
<p>This is the book that will settle those barroom arguments such as 
&quot;what is the difference between a T-bone and a porterhouse?&quot; Answer: 
Both have two muscles, the toploin, and the tenderloin, and on the porterhouse, 
the tenderloin must be at least 1.25&quot; diameter. If the tenderloin is 
smaller, it is a T-bone.</p> 
<p>Worth the price of admission for the beautiful carefully retouched 
photographs of the different bovine cuts, and step by step pix of how they are 
carved out of the larger primals. The invisible retouching helps the reader 
clearly understand the different muscles and subsections.</p> 
<p>There is a lot of inside baseball talk here aimed at chefs and butchers, 
including a chapter called &quot;Cutting for Profit&quot; where you can see how 
a butcher can calculate the resale price and profit margin of a large hunk. 
There is even a complete table of all the professional meat cutter's product 
names and descriptions with the names of the component muscles. This may seem 
superfluous for a backard cook, but this is knowledge that can help keep you 
from being fooled when cash is at stake when you are buying steak. The sections 
on knives, sharpening, safety, and cutting techniques are unique and useful to 
all.</p> 
<p>Spiral bound so it lays flat, there are no recipes, just some generic 
cooking tips, but this is not a cookbook, it is a buyer's guide fo buyers of 
all sort.</p> 
<h2>The Cook and the Butcher: Juicy Recipes, Butcher's Wisdom, and Expert Tips 
by Brigit Binns</h2> 
<p><em>Weldonowen for Williams Sonoma, 2011, $29.95, 223 pages, more than 100 
recipes, many beautiful color photos of the dishes.</em></p> 
<p>Four chapters: Beef, Pork, Lamb, Veal. A lifetime of incredible recipes for 
cooks who are bored with the same old same old.</p> 
<p>Brigit Binns is simply amazing. She is the author of more than two dozen 
cookbooks, many of them for Williams-Sonoma, including this one. She knows so 
much and is so inventive.</p> 
<p>Binns shares more than 100 recipes and, on almost every page, weaves 
through the book tips and quotes from butchers across the nation. An example 
from Frank Castrogiovanni of Ottomanelli Brothers in NYC &quot;Select a flank 
steak that is short and thick with some of the white fat remaining. The longer 
flank steaks are usually chewy&quot;. I didn't know that!</p> 
<p>The recipes are a mix of indoor and outdoor, and they are beautifully 
photographed by Kate Sears. What stands out is the creativity. For example, 
Steak Au Poivre. As Binns explains &quot;This classic French preparation is a 
luxurious combination: the cooked meat, as tender as butter, is finished with a 
bracingly piquant and creamy pan sauce. While some recipes call for the 
peppercorns to be ground and pressed into the meat before cooking, I prefer to 
season the steaks simply, with a sprinkling of salt and black pepper, and to 
feature the green peppercorns in the easy pan sauce.&quot; Well every recipe 
I've ever seen says to coarsely crack the peppercorns, smask them into the 
meat, and then panfry. The problem is that you end up with serious pepper 
overload, you can barely taste the meat, and it is almost impossible to get a 
good flavorful sear with all those huge chunks of pepper holding he meat above 
the hot pan surface. That's one reason I quit making this dish. Until now. 
Binns' approach, which boils green peppercorns and uses them in a pan sauce of 
shallots, butter, Cognac, heavy cream, and beef consomm&eacute;, is so much 
more sensible and elegant. Just like the lady herself.</p> 
<p>Then, on the next page, she turns Philly Cheese Steaks from caterpillar to 
butterfly. Other recipes include Oven Browned Spareribs with Lemongrass, Honey, 
And Soy; Roasted Flank Steak Stuffed with Olives and Pecorino; Maple Brined 
Pork Chops With Pear Chutney; Pork Shoulder Braised in Milk; Double Cut Lamb 
Chops Stuffed with Prunes and Pine Nuts; Grilled Veal Chops with mustard 
Tarragon Aioli. Among the salads, sides, and toppings are Mango Salsa; Sun 
Dried Tomato Jam; Lime, Cabbage, and Jalape&ntilde;o Slaw; and Onion Rings.</p> 
<p>The menu sounds like a 4-star restaurant, but the recipes are easily 
managed with the help of a good butcher, a well stocked kitchen, and the 
guidance of a great cook, like Binns.</p> 
<h2>Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human by Richard Wrangham</h2> 
<p><em>Basic Books, 2010, $15.95, 309 pages, no recipes, no photos.</em></p> 
<p>Wrangham is a professor of biological anthropology at Harvard, Curator of 
Primate Behaviorial Biology at the Peabody Museum, and Director of the Kibale 
Chimpanzee Project in Uganda. He does a remarkable job of telling the 
fascinating tale, and backing it up with ample research data, of how human 
evolution was drastically influenced by the capture of fire and the invention 
of cooking.</p> 
<p>He describes in detail how cooking changes the chemistry of food and how 
that made it easier for proto humans to chew, digest, and extract energy and 
nutrients, and how that impacted their body shape, lips, jaws, teeth, 
intestines, and most importantly, brain size, allowing the emergence of<em>Homo 
erectus</em>, our direct ancestors. He also explains how cooking was largely 
responsible for the differentiating of male and female roles in early societies.
</p> 
<p>Despite his impressive credentials, there is nothing academic or textbook 
about this fascinating read. Witness: &quot;Humans are adapted to eating cooked 
food in the same essential way as cows ar adapted to eating grass, or fleas to 
sucking blood, or any other animal to its signature diet. We humans are the 
cooking apes, the creatures of the flame.&quot;</p> 
<p>Without being argumentative, Wrangham uses data from the raw food movement 
and related research to build an irrefutable case for the role of meat in past 
and present diets.</p> 
<p>Wrangham has added a rich new layer to the story of human evolution, an ah 
ha moment, and a particularly satisfying insight for thos of us who love to 
hang out at the grill.</p> 
<p>This innovative lucid account demonstrates that, not only did humans create 
cuisine, cuisine created humans.</p> <br>

<h2><strong>The Tummy Trilogy by Calvin Trillin </strong></h2> 
<p>The Tummy Trilogy is actually three books in one, all long out of print, 
but occasionally available used. Trillin is witty, urbane, observant, and 
ironic, and he has written intelligently on everything from politics to 
barbecue. These three books, American Fried (1974), Alice, Let's Eat (1978), 
and Third Helpings (1983), are insightful recountings of meals, eateries, and 
eaters. Although so much has changed on the culinary scene since then, Trillin 
is a great storyteller, and his wisdom paved the way for people like us to 
openly admire &quot;common&quot; food like ribs, hotdogs, and burgers.</p> 
<p>The American Fried, the first in the trilogy, speaks directly to rib eaters 
with its first sentence: &quot;The best restaurants in the world are, of 
course, in Kansas City. Not all of them; only the top four or five. Anyone who 
has visited Kansas City and still doubts that statement has my sympathy: He 
never made it to the right places.&quot; A few pages later he drives home his 
point: &quot;It has long been acknowledged that the single best restaurant in 
the world is Arthur Bryant's Barbecue at Eighteenth and Brooklyn in Kansas 
City.&quot; There are a lot of folks I know who agree with this statement to 
this day.</p>

<h2>The Foie Gras Wars: How a 5,000-Year-Old Delicacy Inspired the World's 
Fiercest Food Fight by Mark Caro</h2> 
<p>Most of us have never tasted foie gras. If you're among them, I'm here to 
tell you that there is nothing like it, and that, if you love food, you must 
try it. When prepared properly, the taste is unforgettable.</p> 
<p>But the delicacy has been at the center of a controversy that has given it 
a bit of a bad taste. So I came to Mark Caro's book hopeful that he would 
answer the question for me: Is the way they make foie gras cruel?</p> 
<p>Caro is a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, and when, out of the blue, the 
Chicago City Council, decided to ban the serving of foie gras, even though many 
members admitted to never having heard of it, no less tasted it or studied its 
production, he was assigned to cover the story. It grew into a fascinating tale 
that weaves together Chicago politics, animal husbandry, physiology, 
Philadelphia politics, history, culture, California politics, the animal rights 
movement, new age farming, New York politics, food fights between chefs, and 
cooking. And he does it well, with more than a few chuckles along the way.</p> 
<p>How can the livers of geese and ducks be so controversial and interesting? 
It seems that, as long ago as 5,000 years, hunters discovered that geese and 
ducks, when preparing to migrate, gorged on food to build their fat reserves 
for the long journey, and at that point in time, their enlarged livers were 
spectacular tasting. Rich, complex, not like any other liver, more akin to 
eating a stick of the richest buttery cream cheese imaginable. They wanted it 
year round, so they came up with a method of replicating the process on their 
farms. The took a funnel, stuck a tube on the end, and inserted it in the mouth 
and down the throat of their geese and ducks. Then they poured in the feed.</p> 
<p>French farmers became experts at the technique, where it is sold in 
groceries and gas stations. In the US, at one time, the dish was served only in 
fancy French restaurants, but in recent years, it's popularity has grown 
slightly, showing up on upscale menus, and even occasionally in unsuspecting 
places, like embedded in hamburgers.</p> 
<p>Despite the fact that very little of it is made and it is sold only to the 
wealthy, animal rights activists, especially vegetarians, saw foie gras a low 
hanging fruit, an easy target for advancing their cause. They declared the 
method of feeding, called<em>gavage</em>, to be torture, made some video of the 
birds being fed, and started showing it on the web and to politicians.</p> 
<p>Caro gets to know the animal rights activists and introduces them to us, as 
well as the farmers, the chefs, importers, physiologists, and the politicians, 
and weaves their fascinating personalities and tales into a fine story. He 
visits farms in California, New York, Minnesota, and even stays on a farm in 
France, where he is allowed to observe the process.</p> 
<p>So, is gavage as painful? Alas, if you come to this book hoping that Caro 
will give you a simple answer, you will be disappointed. There are only a 
handful of legitimate studies, and the results are inconclusive. Among them, 
there are documented cases of animals coming towards the feeder willingly, 
while others shy away. Scientists point out that the throats of ducks and geese 
are a lot different than ours, and they have no gag reflex. Remember, they 
swallow spiny fish whole. Caro reports these studies and more in detail.</p> 
<p>Early in the book he tells us how superstar chef Charlie Trotter quietly, 
without fanfare, decided to stop serving foie gras. Caro mentions this to 
another star, Rick Tramonto, who calls Trotter's decision hypocritical. 
&quot;Either you believe in eating animals for sustenance or you don't.&quot; 
Ouch.</p> 
<p>Caro asks Trotter for a response and gets this: &quot;Rick Tramonto's not 
the smartest guy on the block. Yes, animals are raised to be slaughtered, but 
are they raised in a way where they need to suffer? To then be slaughtered for 
pure enjoyment? He can't be that dumb can he? You should quote me on that. 
What's up with that? It's like an idiot comment: 'All animals are raised to be 
slaughtered.' Oh, OK. Maybe we ought to have Rick's liver for a little treat. 
It's certainly fat enough.&quot; Touch&eacute;!</p> 
<h2>DIY Cocktails: A Simple Guide to Creating Your Own Signature Drinks by 
Marcia Simmons &amp; Jonas Halpren</h2> 
<p><em>Adams Media, 2011, $18.99, 228 pages, paperback, numerous color photos.
</em></p> 
<p>I own several bartending guides and I've seen many others, but I have never 
seen anything like this. In an era where bartenders are becoming &quot;cocktail 
chefs&quot;, and mixed drinks are now made with weeds and meat extracts, 
Simmons &amp; Halpren,DrinkOfTheWeek.com editors, have managed to not only 
concoct something creative and unique, but something really useful.</p> 
<p><em>DIY Cocktails</em> is based on categories and ratios so we can 
understand the concepts of what the elements of a balanced mix. Their motto is 
&quot;ditch the recipe, use the ratio&quot;.</p> 
<p>They break ingredients into these categories: Strong (spirits), sweet 
(sugars, syrups, liqueurs, and fruits), sour (tart things like citrus, and 
berries), aromatic (a subset of sour including vermouth, and bitters), weak 
(water, club soda, tonic), and mild (a subset of weak including milk and cream).
</p> 
<p>They give you guidelines for creating a recipe with ratios, so a typical 
tropical drink has a flavor profile of 4:3:1, 4 parts strong, 3 parts sweet, 1 
part sour. At the core of the book are 10 foundation ratios, and then scores of 
recipes built on these foundations.</p> 
<p>There is also a section called &quot;Tools &amp; Techniques Cheat 
Sheet&quot; that discusses prep, glassware and drink sizes, chilling, muddling, 
measuring, and mixing. Along the way they teach us about ingredients, like how 
to make infused spirits. If you haven't noticed, spirits steeped with herbs, 
citrus rinds, fruits, peppers, and vegetables are all the rage in bars nowadays.
</p> 
<p>But don't worry, it is not all conceptual. There are scores of recipes 
ranging from the old standbys like the Old Fashioned, to surprisingly tasty 
treats like the Watermelon-Cucumber Refresher. Then they show you how to 
customize them. Just reading it significantly enhanced my bartending skills.</p>
<br> 
<h1>Magazines and periodicals</h1> 
<h2><strong>Cook's Illustrated </strong></h2> 
<p>This is a great cooking magazine. The authors have grown from a really good 
magazine that people in the know swore by, to a great website, to a TV show, 
and have recently added another magazine.</p> 
<p>The outstanding feature of their approach is that they test every 
assumption and often dispel myths. Their specialty is rethinking old recipes, 
and developing new techniques that work better than the tried and maybe no 
longer true. They will do things like cook a sauce at five different 
temperatures to determine what is the optimum. They also often develop 
techniques for shortening the preparation or cooking time for a dish. Or lower 
the fat. Or make it more flavorful.</p> 
<p>In addition, they test equipment in a rigorous fashion similar to Consumer 
Reports. What is the best saucepan? They test nine of them by steaming rice, 
scalding cream, browning onions, and making pastry cream. They also have lots 
of little tips and tricks from their staff and their readers. There are no ads, 
and the painting on the front cover is elegant and mouth-watering. The back 
cover usually is a painted poster showing, for example, 12 different kind of 
peaches. The main body of the magazine is illustrated in realistic 
black-and-white pen-and-ink drawings, and small color photos appear on the 
inside back cover.</p> 
<p>Here's how staffer Sean Lawrence approached the problem of developing a 
recipe for the ultimate Pepper-Crusted Filet Mignon: &quot;I recalled the test 
kitchen's prior frustrations with peppercorn crusts. Peppercorns fall off in 
the pan, interfere with the meat's browning, and - used in sufficient quantity 
to create a real crust - delivering punishing pungency.&quot; He solved the 
problems by crushing the peppercorns by rocking a skillet on them; defanged 
them by simmering them in olive oil; improved adherence by pressing them into 
the filets and then covering them with plastic wrap and letting them rest for 
an hour; then saut&eacute;d the meat in a well-oiled skillet until the meat 
browned beneath the peppercorns; and finished them off by roasting them in the 
oven to complete the cooking and brown the sides. Clever, no?</p> 
<h2>Bon App&eacute;tit</h2> 
<p>A big, sumptuous feast of recipes and ideas, drool inducing photos, probing 
interviews, memoirs, travel, tips on technique, culinaria, restaurant guides, 
product reviews, what to drink, trends, pop culture, and eternal culture. 
Emphasis on fast, easy, and fresh by authors who really know their stuff. The 
title may sound snooty, but don't let it fool you. I read every issue as soon 
as it arrives.</p> 
<h2><strong>All About Beer </strong></h2> 
<p>Easily the leading beer magazine, each of the six issues per year contains 
features about different beer types, breweries, the interesting characters who 
make it, places to drink it, beer and food matching, the politics influencing 
the marketplace, insider news, new releases, ratings and reviews, travel, 
commercial brewing, home brewing, beer tasting, cooking with beer, results from 
beer competitions, collecting beer memorabilia, history, interviews, glassware, 
calendar of events, travel, book reviews, pub hopping, as well as brewery 
openings and closings. Publisher Daniel Bradford is well respected and brings 
great insight to the subject, as do columnists Michael Jackson, Fred Eckhardt, 
and the others.</p> 
<h2><strong>Wine Spectator </strong></h2> 
<p>The leading wine periodical comes out 16 times a year, and it is rich in 
features about the endless range of wine types, the regions from where they 
come, and the fascinating people who make them. Each issue has hundreds of wine 
reviews and ratings on a 100 point scale.</p> 
<p>There is a special issue devoted to their Restaurant Grand Award Winners, 
another on the Top 100 wines of the Year, and another on Great Wine Values. 
Every issue comes with a Wine Spectator Buying Guide, full of reviews and 
ratings for over 500 wine releases. While their articles occasionally sound 
boosterish, their ratings seem fair, despite occasional grumbling that they are 
influenced by advertising. I once published a magazine that competed with the 
Spectator, and I never saw evidence that they favored advertisers. There are 
also some great recipes and insightful travel pieces.</p> 
<h2><strong>Wine Advocate </strong></h2> 
<p>Robert Parker is the most influential individual in the wine world. He and 
his associates taste thousands of wines each year, and that's pretty much all 
you'll find in this newsletter. No photos, no biographies swooning over 
iconoclastic winemakers, just ratings and descriptions of wines.</p> 
<p>Occasionally they mention the better restaurants and hotels they've 
encountered on their travels. The problem is that the top rated wines sell out 
almost overnight and are practically impossible to buy. My biggest complaint is 
that they taste too many wines per day and as a result they seem to favor 
bigger, more powerful wines that stand out from the crowd. Delicate, more 
subtle, elegant wines seem to fall by the wayside. In addition, some wineries 
will not send them samples, so they are forced to taste these important wines 
at the winery, from selected barrels, with the winemaker hovering. Not 
surprisingly these wines seem to score very high. But if I owned a restaurant, 
I would read my copy of the Wine Advocate the same day it arrived.</p> 
<h1>For the trade</h1> 
<h2><strong>Restaurant Hospitality </strong></h2> 
<p>Aimed at commercial food service executives, Restaurant Hospitality is a 
beautiful glossy magazine that is well written and researched. They tend to 
delve into subjects a bit more than Nation's Restaurant News, and typically 
have good pieces on menu planning and marketing, design and decor, as well as 
operations ideas for managing people and expenses. The features include 
profiles of industry leaders, interviews, and product reviews. The recipes are 
often creative, and scaled for large production. Full disclosure: I write for 
them occasionally.</p> 
<h2><strong>Nation's Restaurant News </strong></h2> 
<p>A classic trade publication, this glossy color tabloid comes out 50 times 
per year and is fat with trends, statistics, news, mergers and acquisitions, 
openings and closings, opinions, interviews with movers and shakers in the 
world of food and drink, profiles of restaurants and restaurant chains, 
analysis of government regulations, debates, and advertisements from vendors of 
everything from pork to paper goods. Nation's Restaurant News is a must for 
anyone currently in the biz or planning to get into the biz.</p>

<p>There are a small handful of good food photography and styling books I have 
reviewed. Just click the link to see them.</p> <br>

<h1> Read this before posting a comment please:</h1> 
<p>1) If you are looking for info, please use the table of contents or the 
search box, at the top of every page.</p> 
<p>2) Don't ask me any questions that involve temp or time unless you tell me 
that you are using a digital thermometer! Bi-metal dial thermometers are often 
off by as much as 50&deg;F! If you are not using a good digital you have no 
idea what the temp really is so I can't help you. If you are still using a dial 
thermometer, please read this article about thermometers, then buy a good 
digital, and then, if the problem persists (chances are it won't), hit me with 
your questions.Then, please tell me <em>everything</em> I need to know to 
answer your question. Like the type of cooker you are using. Remember, I am not 
a mind reader.</p> 
<p>3) Please don't ask me &quot;What grill (or smoker) should I buy?&quot; 
Read myBuyer's Guides and the buying checklists and follow the links. I've 
shared just about everything I know. Pay attention to the awards I have given 
my faves. I cannot pick the right cooker for you any more than I could pick the 
right car or spouse for you.</p> 
<p>4) If you have problems posting with Internet Explorer, please read this. 
If problems persist,send me a note.</p>
