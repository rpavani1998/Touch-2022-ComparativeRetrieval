<b>Question: </b>Which produces better 
tasting food? Charcoal or gas?  Which produces better tasting food? Charcoal or 
gas? This seems to be an age old question and to be honest there might not be a 
definitive answer. There is however from strong evidence to point you in the 
right direction. <b>Answer: </b>Though a few people might debate it, charcoal 
produces better tasting grilled foods most the time. Not to say that some 
things taste worse, just some things don't taste any different. &quot;Good 
Housekeeping&quot; magazine did a blind taste test and found that people could 
not tell the difference between hamburgers or skinless chicken breasts cooked 
over gas or charcoal. However people could tell the difference with a steak. 
Their conclusion was that the longer you grilled something the more the flavor 
of the fire gets into the food. The mechanism involved here is the smoke. 
Charcoal, even though it is just smoldering, produces smoke.
<p>Gas grills use a nice clean fuel that doesn't really produce smoke. 
Manufacturers will tell you that their patented vaporization barriers produce 
smoke from dripping grease, but do you really want the flavor of burning grease 
in your food? To be honest it doesn't do a lot for the flavor of the things you 
grill. The kind of smoke that improves the flavor of food is the kind you get 
from smoke.</p> 
<p>You can add smoker chips in a box to produce smoke but to pass that flavor 
to the food you need to bath it in smoke. Since charcoal produces some smoke 
and heat the too are mixed together. As the food absorbs the heat it also takes 
in the flavor of the smoke. So if you really like the flavor of foods, 
particularly things like a good steak, cooked over an open flame then you want 
to use charcoal.</p> 
<p>However you also need to make sure that the smoke you are getting from the 
charcoal is good smoke. Commercial charcoals with special additives for easy 
lighting and cheap charcoal made from a little sawdust and a lot of glue 
doesn't exactly have the best flavor producing smoke. You want to use a good 
charcoal or mix your charcoal with chunks of good hardwood or you can buy lump 
charcoal that is actually make from really pieces of wood and not just sawdust. 
You should also always keep a good clean grill. Build-ups of ashes, burned up 
grease and other stuff will make the smoke produced leave a strange flavor on 
foods. So in this light if you are going to use cheap self-lighting charcoal in 
a dirty, rusted grill then I'd suggest going with gas. If however you are 
serious about the flavor of grilled foods and are willing to put the effort 
into the process then a good charcoal grill might just be what you need.</p>
