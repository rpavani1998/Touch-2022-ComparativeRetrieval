<h2><strong>Reviewers</strong></h2> 
<p>Many reviews are by Meathead, the author of most things on this website. In 
2012Max Good joined our staff as Director of Buyer's Guides and more and more 
of the reviews come from him. A few reviews have been contributed by Scot 
Murphy and Gordon Hubbell.</p> 
<h2><strong>Best In BBQ Medals</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Best In BBQ Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals are given only 
to products that we highly recommend based on price. Awards are based on 
features, quality, and value. Price is an important factor. Rarely will a $400 
Gold Medal be in the same league as an $800 Gold Medal, so it is important that 
you read the reviews. Rest assured that when we award a medal, it is because we 
are impressed by it for the price, not because someone has paid us to say so or 
because the company is an advertiser or sponsor.<strong>Manufacturers: </strong>

<h2>About Model Numbers</h2> 
<p>Manufacturers often make slight variations to their basic model exclusively 
for certain merchants. For example, a grill manufacturer might make their 
Firebrand Grill Model ABC123 with cast iron grates available only on Amazon. 
Meanwhile, the ABC125 is identical except it has stainless steel grates, and it 
is sold only at ACE Hardware. Of course the prices can differ.</p> 
<h2><strong>Your Amazon Purchase Supports This Site</strong></h2> 
<p>When a product is available on Amazon.com, we often provide a direct link. 
Amazon often has the best prices anywhere, even better than many manufacturers' 
websites because manufacturers know that if they undercut retailers like 
Amazon, they may drop the products. Amazon also offers fast delivery (often 
free), no sales tax (in most states), gift wrapping (on many items), and 
painless refund policies. Check outAmazon's Gift &amp; Wish Registry.</p> 
<p><strong>IMPORTANT. </strong>Amazon pays AmazingRibs Inc. a small referral 
fee when you purchase from them after clicking on a link on this site, so 
purchasing from them helps underwrite the cost of operating AmazingRibs.com.</p>
<p>If you like all the info we give you for free and would like to help us 
stay free, please copy the link below and save it. It takes you to Amazon.com 
and tags things you buy with the AmazingRibs code so we get that referral fee.

<h2>Seasoning and calibrating your grill or smoker with dry runs</h2> 
<p>The first thing to do after you assemble your new grill or smoker is to 
season it and calibrate it by doing a few dry runs <em>without food</em>. This 
will burn off any manufacturer's grease, and give you a sense for how to set it 
up to hit the two important target temps that almost all my recipes use: 
225&deg;F and 325&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Of course, in order to do this, you <em>absolutely positively</em> must 
have a gooddigital oven thermometer. I don't care how much you spent on your 
grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and 
unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50&deg;F. Worse still, it is in 
the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. 
Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food.</p> <br>

<br> 
<h1>All About Gas Grills, with Gas Grill Reviews and Ratings</h1> 
<p>Want to start a new business? I'll tell you one to avoid: Manufacturing gas 
grills. Man, there are a lot of choices out there. But that's good for us. 
Prices are competitive.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for a gas grill there are more options and bells and 
whistles to chose from than digital cameras. Some actually even come with the 
kitchen sink attached. There are many producers, most of them listed below, and 
each makes several models, some make a bewildering array of models, and 
producers are constantly tweaking their designs. So it is impossible for me to 
review them all. But I have tried to include the most widely distributed units 
as well as those I think are especially interesting. The producers who are most 
widely distributed are the big three,Brinkmann, Char-Broil, and Weber.</p> 
<h2><strong>The most important feature</strong></h2> 
<p>A good gas grill must have a minimum of two burners is a must for 2-Zone or 
Indirect Cooking, the most important technique you need to learn for successful 
outdoor cooking.</p> 
<p>The more burners, the better. Some burners line up side to side and others 
line up front to back. With burners lined up from side to side you can then 
turn off one side, as in the picture below, and slow roast over the indirect 
zone, and then crisp over the direct zone. You can also put meat in the 
indirect zone for holding. The bigger the cooking surface, the more flexibility 
you have. Side to side is better for most cooking. Front to back is better for 
rotisserie cooking. If the knobs are on the front, that's usually a good sign 
that the burners line up from side to side.</p> 
<p>One more thing. Even top end gas grill manufacturers tend to buy heat 
indicators (I refuse to call them thermometers) from the lowest bidder. These 
junky dials have ruined more meals and caused more tummy aches than spoiled 
meat. You absolutely cannot rely on them because they are often off by 50&deg;F 
or more and the most important thing a good cook needs is a relaible 
thermometer and a watch. Thereis a link just below to my buyer's guide to 
thermometers. Please please read and heed.</p>

Click the red links for current pricing and more info.</h1> 
<h2>Alfresco Grills</h2> 
<p>Mostly built-in units.</p> 
<h2>American Outdoor Grills</h2> 
<h2>Artisan Outdoor Grills</h2> <br>

<h2>Blue Ember Grills</h2> 
<p>All their grills have stainless steel burners, a smoke box, a rear access 
grease pan, and most important, a bottle opener. A word of caution: In 2009 the 
manufacturer issued a voluntary safety notice. Apparently the hose of the gas 
tank can get too close to the firebox and be exposed to heat when the propane 
cylinder or grease tray is not installed properly, posing a fire hazard. 
According to Blue Ember, they also had to discontinue their pioneering 
thermostat controlled grill because the electronics were not reliable.</p> 
<p><strong>The Outdoor Chef</strong> has three burners producing 45,000 BTU 
under a 500 square inch porcelain coated cast iron grate. Mostly porcelain 
coated steel with cast aluminum on the sides of the hood. An internal halogen 
light and a built in electrical outlet are optional.</p> 
<p><strong>The Party Starter</strong> adds a 12,000 BTU cast brass side burner 
on the right wing. The left wind has a recessed bowl for ice, condiments, or 
even trash. The light and outlet are also optional.</p> 
<p><strong>The Performer</strong> adds a sonar propane monitor that pings the 
tank to gauge the contents and a 12,000 BTU rotisserie burner on the rear wall.
Blue Ember Grills.<em>- Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Brinkmann</h2> 
<p>Brinkmann makes low end grills from lightweight, inexpensive materials. 
They will not last as long as a Weber. On the other hand, they pack a lot of 
features and bells and whistles into them, and they are very capable for the 
price. One of the problems in shopping for Brinkmanns is that they have so many 
different models, and not all of them are on their website. Sometimes I think 
they have some of the models on the website at high prices because they are 
similar to models sold in the big box stores at much lower prices so people 
researching grills will think they are getting a real bargain in the hardware 
stores.</p> 
<p><strong>Brinkmann Pro Series 4 Burner Gas Grill.</strong> There are four 
burners so it is easy to turn off one side and leave the other on for indirect 
grilling. There is a side burner and a rotisserie burner, all with electronic 
ignition. The rotisserie motor, spit, and brackets are not included and they 
cost more than $100. The grates are thin wire coated with enamel. The grease 
tray pulls out the back as with most Brinkmanns. The cart is preassembled and 
folded so putting this one together is fairly easy. It is cheaply built but it 
is cheaply priced.</p> 
<p><strong>Brinkmann 5-Burner Smoke 'N Grill Professional Smoker.</strong> 
This highly innovative design is really two discrete cookers in one. There is a 
5 burner 50,000 BTU grill with 554 square inches of primary cooking space as 
well as a 12,000 BTU sideburner, and in the cabinet below is a complete 
enclosed small cabinet gas smoker. As with most Brinkmanns, the grease tray is 
removed from the back side.</p> 
<p>The smoker has a small burner that may not be enough for smoking in the 
snow, the water pan is very shallow and will need frequent refilling, the bowl 
for wood chips is also small, there are two adjustable shelves, and a nice door 
gasket.</p> 
<p>The grill's grates are narrow porcelain coated, the hood has an inner 
liner, and there is a rotisserie burner on the back wall. Click here for more 
info and pricing:Brinkmann<em>. - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Broilking</h2> 
<p>This company makes many different models, from small portables to large 
units with two hoods.</p> 
<h2>Broilmaster</h2> 
<p>Specializes in cast aluminum grills with stainless steel grates and ceramic 
&quot;briquets&quot;.</p> 
<h2>Bull</h2> 
<p>Highly regarded well made expensive gas grills under the Bull brand label, 
both cart mounted, and built-ins.</p> 
<h2>Cal Flame</h2> <br>

<h2>Capital</h2> 
<p>Capital makes two lines of high-end stainless grills on carts and built-ins.
</p> 
<h2>Char-Broil</h2> 
<p>Char-Broil is an innovator with clever designs and mid-range prices, 
currently emphasizing radiant &quot;infrared&quot; heat. They have excellent 
customer service.</p> 
<p>Char-Broil Quantum Grills. I have a Char-Broil Quantum Commercial 4-Burner. 
This line of stainless steel grills has several clever core features and two 
glaring flaws. The burners line up from side to side, the best alignment for 
indirect cooking, and they are very close to the grates for high heat. They 
have enameled heat deflectors</p> 
<p>The stainless steel grates have a plate of stainless steel below them so 
they get very hot and radiate the heat very evenly across the surface. The 
plates have small holes below them allowing combustion gases up and some 
drippings down, both good for flavor. Most drippings, hit the plates and 
incinerate, adding more flavor to the meat. Flaw #1: The metal grates are not 
the highest grade stainless so they rust and corrode easily, and the holes are 
too small so they need frequent cleaning or they clog. Char-Broil recently has 
announced some techniques for cleaning them that may work but they came too 
late for me. After one year, rather than fuss with them, I replaced the factory 
grates with another company's product,GrillGrates, which operate on the same 
principle, only better. With the GrillGrates, I consider this a superior grill 
capable of high enough heat for crisping steaks. Mine easily goes over 
600&deg;F on the grate surface.</p> 
<p>The lid has an inner double layer to help keep in heat. It is capable of 
high enough heats for searing steaks, and can smoke meats easily by tossing 
food grade wood chips, sawdust, or pellets between the grates, right below the 
food or off to the side. The stainless on the hood is lightweight and is hard 
to clean. Much of the rest is painted silver. It can easily be adapted from 
propane to natural gas with a kit sold separately. Some premium models come 
with halogen lights inside the hood and a digital propane tank gauge. Some 
models feature a bi-metallic temperature gauge located above each control knob 
purportedly measuring the temp above each burner. Alas, I don't have much faith 
inthe accuracy of these gauges. Still, even if they are off, they should give 
you guidance relative to each other.</p> 
<p>The side burner on mine came with a cast aluminum griddle that fits on the 
side burner. The side burner has a dome lid so you can cover the griddle or 
saucepan if you wish. Alas the hinges on the dome are pretty flimsy. Flaw #2: 
Rotisserie cooking seems to be an afterthought on this unit. When I bought the 
rotisserie unit (it is not included in the 580), the left bracket scraped 
against the lid of the side burner so I had to mount it to the inside of the 
cooking chamber. That was easy because the mounting holes go through. You have 
to be certain to mount the motor upside down or when the lid goes down it won't 
close. The rod comes in two parts and must be screwed together. I had to have 
my local auto body shop weld the two parts together to keep them from coming 
loose.</p> 
<p><strong>Char-Broil RED Grills.</strong> This line of grills is entirely 
innovative and it is sold mostly through Home Depot. Below the porcelain coated 
cast iron grates, there is a dark parabolic non-stick bowl. Lift it out and 
there is another stainless steel parabolic bowl for it to sit above with the 
burner in the center. So you get this reflective bowl heating another bowl that 
radiates heat to the grates nice and even. You can throw wood chips in the 
inner bowl and they smolder nicely. It also catches drips and is easy to clean. 
Reds have a double layer on the hood, providing more insulation and heat 
retention. Cleanup is easy. The only problem is that it is not easy to set up 
for 2-zone cooking, but the entire grill is really indirect cooking, so you can 
cook low and slow, and then crank the heat at the end for crisping.</p> 
<p><strong>The Two-Burner Model</strong> has two burners and 300 square inches 
of cooking surface, 21,300 BTU primary burners, lightweight porcelain coated 
cast iron grates, and lightweight fold up shelves on the side. There is no 
natural gas conversion kit available.</p> 
<p><strong>The Stainless Model</strong> and <strong>Enamel Model</strong> have 
three burners, 550 square inches of porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates 
with 34,500 BTU burners, and a 13,000 BTU sideburner that lies flush with the 
shelf. The lid on the enamel is heavy, and this is good. It has a nifty rack in 
the door for sauce and spices, and a towel rack. The inner bowl is highly 
polished chrome for more heat.</p> 
<p><strong>The Four Burner Model</strong> has four burners, an auto cleaning 
feature that allows you to leave it on when you are done cooking to burn off 
juices and residue, and it shuts itself off. It has 31,000 BTU stainless steel 
burners, 580 square inches of enamel coated cast iron grates, built-in grill 
lights, a lot of stainless from the hood to the shelves and some other parts, 
two storage drawers, and a 13,000 BTU sideburner with a hood. A natural gas 
converter is available.</p> 
<p><strong>The Four Burner Stanless Model</strong> is another four burner that 
is mostly stainless and comes with everything that the other has but is amped 
up with with 42,000 BTU, 620 square inches of porcelain coated cast iron 
grates, rotisserie is included, so is a cast aluminum griddle for the 
sideburner, and there is a digital display for the tank gauge, timer, and meat 
temperature probe.</p> 
<p><strong>Char-Broil Quickset Grills.</strong> These are low end inexpensive 
two burner convection units.</p>

<h2>Char-Griller 5050 Duo Gas-and-Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>This is a great concept, a capacious gas grill and a charcoal grill side by 
side, all in one unit, and you can add an optional offset firebox to make it a 
smoker, too. Click here tosee our review on the Charcoal Grill Review page.</p> 
<h2>Crown Verity</h2> 
<p>Heavy duty no frills, frumpy, but serious looking stainless steel grills 
aimed at commercial users.</p> 
<h2>Delta Heat</h2> 
<h2>Ducane Affinity Grills</h2> 
<p>The Ducane Brothers Metal Fabricating Company started in 1946, specializing 
in manufacture of oil-fired furnaces. They began making gas grills around 1975 
with the slogan, &quot;Buy your last grill first&quot; and developed a 
respectable following. Indeed many Ducane owners seem hooked.</p> 
<p>When the company went up for sale around 2004, Weber-Stephens swooped in 
and grabbed it. I asked the folks at Weber what the acquisition brought to 
their business. Were they concerned that Ducane simply cannibalizes Weber 
sales? &quot;Ducane has Weber DNA,&quot; they replied, &quot;It's a great brand 
that offers value to people who aren't in the price range of the Genesis 
line&quot;.</p> 
<p>Manufacturing was immediately shifted from North Carolina to China, where 
Weber makes their entry level Spirit Series. Current Ducane product line 
consists of three LP Gas models: The Affinity 3100, 4100 and 4200. All three 
are virtually identical in construction and appearance: Black 
porcelain-enameled steel body with cast aluminum sides and stainless steel 
control panel and side tables. As one opens and closes and fiddles with knobs, 
it's easy to believe the Ducane reputation for basic, functional and durable 
grills remains intact. &quot;Serviceable&quot; is a word that comes to mind.</p>
<p>All Affinity models have stainless steel burners that line up left to right 
the way we like them, battery powered electric ignition, grease catch pan, two 
locking casters and two swivel casters. And of course the obligatory cheap 
built-in lid thermometers which you will want to ignore anduse a more accurate 
digital thermometer.</p> 
<p>Instead of a small grate, The removable warming rack is different than 
most, which are standard wire racks. On the Ducanes they are porcelain-enamel 
coated steel trays with slits cut through them. The heat distribution plates 
are very large, covering most of the area beneath the cooking grates and 
it&rsquo;s easy to see why Weber chose not to refer to them as &quot;flavorizer 
bars&quot; as they do on the Weber line. One user griped online claiming the 
heat distribution plates are too close to the cooking grate and so large they 
catch all the drippings thus exacerbating flare-ups. That might be a problem, 
but in general, the closer to the cooking surface, the hotter the surface and 
the better searing.</p> 
<p>The assembly manuals are of the IKEA variety: All illustrations, almost no 
words.</p> 
<p><strong>Ducane Affinity 3100</strong> features three burners generating 
36,000 BTUs and a grilling area of 407 square inch, slightly less than the 418 
square inches claimed in Ducane's brochure. This small discrepancy is due to 
Affinity&rsquo;s frame design which blocks small portions of the stainless 
steel rod cooking grates.</p> 
<p><strong>Ducane Affinity 4100</strong> (shown above) has four burners for 
48,000 BTUs and 508 square inches of actual grilling surface, less than the 526 
square inches of stainless steel rod cooking grate. Stainless steel rod cooking 
grates.</p> 
<p><strong>Ducane Affinity 4200</strong> is exclusive to Lowe's. It is the 
same as the 4100 but it has porcelain-enameled cast iron cooking grates and a 
flush mounted side burner.</p> 
<p><strong>Bottom line.</strong> These are basic, no-frills, value grills 
backed by Weber's good name and their stellar customer support.<em>- Max Good
</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Dyna Glo</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Dyna-Glo Dual Fuel LP Gas and Charcoal Grill</strong>. <em>Now 
that's what I'm talkin' 'bout.</em> You've got gas burners on one side and 
charcoal on the other. This has a hand cranked, adjustable tray that moves the 
coal up and down for good heat control and a 12,000 BTU stainless steel 
charcoal ignition burner to get the party started. Two stainless steel burners 
on the gas side, enameled cast iron grates all around with 700 square inches 
cooking area. Made of bare and black coated stainless steel with one 12,000 BTU 
side burner, one side table and a built in bottle opener.<em> - Max Good</em>
</p> 
<h2>Fire Magic</h2> 
<p>Fire Magic grills have been manufactured in California since 1937. These 
luxury grills exude elegance and quality. Excellent in design and construction, 
beautiful to behold and priced accordingly. These are among the finest grills 
made.</p> 
<p>In 1982 RH Peterson, pioneers in fabrication of realistic, artificial gas 
logs, acquired Fire Magic to complement their outdoor lifestyle line. They 
produce not only free standing gas, coal and electric grills on carts and 
pedestals, but drop in grills and components for outdoor kitchens, including an 
array of add-ons like side burners, doors, drawers, sinks, refrigerators, 
kegerators, timers, lights and more. All premium quality and made in America.
</p> 
<p>Fire Magic builds two gas grill lines, their premier Echelon Diamond Series 
and their second tier Aurora Series. All are made with high quality 304 cast 
stainless steel burners, cooking grates and housings that carry a lifetime 
warranty. Warranty for various components then drops to 15 years for brass 
valves and backburner and manifold assemblies all the way down to 1 year for 
electric systems. Lifetime ownership is a Fire Magic mantra. All grills are 
shipped with conversion kits that facilitate propane or natural gas should your 
preference change. Echelons also include your own personalized nameplate.</p> 
<p>Access to burners is easy for cleaning, smoking, or setting up a 
rotisserie. The stainless steel cooking grates are thick and heavy. 16 guage 
stainless steel flavor grids blanket the burners for even heat distribution and 
the cast stainless steel E-burners, actually shaped more like an H, are super 
heavy duty and designed to spread flame throughout the firebox. One owner 
likened the intensity to &quot;a sea of fire&quot;. All models have electric 
ignition, built-in digital thermometers and meat probes, 12&quot; deep firebox 
(mighty nice for rotisserie) and double wall spring assisted hoods. Removable 
warming racks can be stored on brackets behind the hood. These brackets also 
hold the rotisserie spit. Backburners include a stainless steel cover for 
protection when not in use. Heavy is a word that came to mind throughout my 
inspection. Everything looks and feels solid.</p> 
<p>My local Fire Magic dealer clearly took pride in demonstrating his wares, 
stating the burners have a range of 200&deg;F for slow roasting and smoking all 
the way up to 1600&deg;F to sear steaks in minutes, just like steakhouses. All 
monitored by the onboard digital thermometers. He warns new owners to reduce 
cooking times, &quot;It's like getting behind the wheel of a Ferrari when 
you're used to driving a Taurus&quot;. Echelon and Aurora both have drip 
collection systems that consist of a tapered firebox bottom draining into a 
small drawer accessed from the front control panel and equipped with a 
disposable aluminum tray. &quot;But you don't get a lot of grease because most 
burns up on the flavor grids&quot;, he said, &quot;especially if you do a burn 
off after each use&quot;.</p> 
<p>Fire Magic designs are elegant and engineered for customization. The grills 
or &quot;heads&quot; can be purchased for drop in installations or mounted on 
carts and pedestals. The model numbers tell a lot about the model. For example, 
E1060i indicates: E=Echelon, 1060=actual or approximate primary cooking surface 
(in this case 1056 square inches), i=island or drop-in head for install. A660s: 
A=Aurora, 660=660 square inch primary cooking surface, s=stand-alone or mounted 
on a cart. For outdoor kitchen installations, anything in the vast Fire Magic 
catalog may be incorporated. Options for stand-alone models are more limited 
but you may, for instance, replace an E-Burner with an IR Sear Zone.</p> 
<p>Fire Magic also makes most everything you need for a outdoor kitchen 
including smokers, a wide range or attachments and accessories, several 
different side burners, refrigerators, keg coolers and tappers, rotisserie 
baskets, ventilation hoods, griddles, pots and pans, tongs and spatulas, and 
even the kitchen sink.</p> 
<p><strong>Bottom line.</strong> If you're in the market for the best, you 
should consider Fire Magic. If you're building an outdoor kitchen or souped-up 
patio you should consider Fire Magic. Outdoor kitchens are significant home 
improvement projects. Undoubtedly you want yours to last. One Fire Magic dealer 
recounted a call to fix an installed drop-in grill. When asked about its age 
the homeowner replied, &quot;I bought this place 30 years ago and it was 
already here&quot;. To the astonishment of both men, parts were still available 
and the unit was put back in service. I believe this company will stand behind, 
in front of and on top of their products. Indeed, when speaking with Fire Magic 
employees their genuine enthusiasm is palpable. Of course you're not just 
buying reliability and great customer service; you're buying the shining 
centerpiece of your outdoor realm and a lifetime of enjoyment the versatility 
and superior performance these elite cooking machines deliver. What can I say? 
I wish I had one of these fabulous grills. If wishes were Fire Magic, we all 
would drive.</p>

wood and a 26,000 BTU charcoal igniter. Rotisserie and 16,000 BTU backburner 
are optional. The A830i has dial lid thermometers instead of digital (sigh).</p>
<h2>Fire Magic Echelon</h2> 
<p>These are the basic configurations:</p> 
<p>E1060i: 115,000 BTUs Primary, 2 - 11,000 BTU Backburners<br>
 E790i: 99,000 
BTUs Primary, 13,000 Backburner<br>
 E660i: 78,000 BTUs Primary, 11,000 
Backburner</p> 
<p>All Echelon models need to be hooked up to 110 volt power. They are decked 
out with blue LED backlit control knobs and a flame icon on the knob changes 
from blue to red when turned on. The flame's intensity grows brighter on high 
and dimmer on low. Bright, angled halogen hood lights provide ample 
illumination after dark. The manufacturer claims that their hot surface 
ignition system is unaffected by moisture and designed to perform even in harsh 
environments. Heat zone separators slide in and out between each E-burner to 
isolate cooking zones. A long, stainless steel wood chip drawer is incorporated 
in the control panel with its own dedicated 3,000 BTU burner. Craftsmanship is 
even more stunning than the Aurora series. I was floored by seamless welds and 
attention to detail from top to bottom.</p> 
<p>Some options are: &quot;Magic View Window&quot; to check food without 
lifting the hood; motorized hood; solar panels; remote receiver to check 
temperature readings up to 50 feet away from the grill.</p> 
<p>Stand-alone models are available with double or single side burners and 
there are many to choose from. All 304 stainless steel cart construction with 
insulated doors and drawers. Retractable tool and paper towel holders. Fold 
down side shelf with polished edges and handles. Heavy-duty locking swivel 
casters. Two 110V electrical outlets with heavy-duty extension cord.<em> - Max

<h2>GoGalley</h2> 
<p>GoGalley is unlike any other grill in the world. It is a four burner gas 
grill with a serious side burner, and a built-in cabinet-style smoker/oven. 
Smoke your ribs, grill burgers, bake cookies, and fry a turkey, all in one 
portable unit. The whole shootin' match folds up, attaches to a trailer hitch, 
and has a built-in hoist that lifts it up so you can haul it anywhere.</p> 
<p>Solidly built, it is a fine backyard setup, and it is the best rig I've 
ever seen for tailgating or camping. I have tested it andI review it in detail 
on the page devoted to portable grills.<em> - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Holland Grills</h2> 
<p>Holland's difference is that they design their grills to cook by 
convection. Their cart mounted grills have cast iron burners above which is a 
deflection plate that spreads the flame and the heat to the edges of the grill. 
Then there is a large drip pan that sits under the food and radiates heat to 
the stainless steel cooking surface. Their hoods all have chimneys to draw air 
up through the oven area enhancing circulation. Fill the drip pan with water 
and it becomes a steamer or a water smoker. There is no warming rack.</p> 
<p><strong>Heritage Plus</strong>. Pedestal mounted, with polypropylene side 
tables, cast aluminum hood, a grease bucket right out in the open for the dog 
to enjoy, and &quot;one temperature setting eliminates guesswork.&quot; Yikes.
</p> 
<p><strong>Epic</strong>. Cart mounted, looks business-like (that's it at 
right), there is a wood tray for smoke.</p> 
<p><strong>Apex</strong>. Cart mounted or built-in models. Stainless steel 
hood. 13,000 BTU, estimated cooking surface 384 square inches.</p>

<h2>Jenn-Air</h2> 
<p>In June 2010 the Jenn-Air 720-0709, with five burners, got the top ranking 
from Consumer Reports for large grills. I have never seen this model so I 
cannot comment on it. They reviewed only 13 models in the large grill category, 
but in their rankings it bested KitchenAid, Char-Broil Commercial, and Weber 
Summit among others. Their website does not display their grills and they are 
not available in Amazon.</p> 
<p>In August 2010 a reader wrote to say &quot;I purchased the largest model 
offered, after a few months of use the grill started rusting around the doors 
and lid. When I called to inquire about the problem, I was instructed to call 
NexGrill [because] they manufactured the product for Jenn-Air (didn't mention 
that in the warranty)... I phoned customer service (NexGrill) explained my 
issues, I was asked to take pictures... and email the photos to them. Within 
four days I was the owner of a BRAND NEW grill plus the latest model available 
with a letter stating concern over the problem. WOW!!! This is my second go 
around with Jenn-Air. The stove in my home had problems after six months of 
use, the same bull [bleep] and tap dance as the grill... How would I have known 
what a great company NexGrill is. Moral of the story... buy from the company 
that manufactures the product not the no service, price jacking middle man, 
Jenn-Air!&quot;<em> - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Kalamazoo</h2> 
<p>These are the grills dreams are made of. Kalamazoo has taken the concept of 
the outdoor kitchen to the next level. They make high performance gas grills 
and hybrid grills that can also burn charcoal or wood. Ever watch Chef Rick 
Bayless on PBS? When the Top Chef Professional winner and multiple James Beard 
Award winner cooks outdoors as he often does, it's on a Kalamazoo. Lookit those 
super wide grates and that huge, roomy hood. They make outdoor refrigerators, 
freezers, wine chillers, keg tappers, ice makers, weather-tight cabinets, 
wok-ready cooktops, a lobster boil pit, warming drawers, and an awesome pizza 
oven. They claim that the seamless rain gutter surrounding their doors and 
drawers makes them a &quot;weather-tight vault, the only cabinets that will 
keep your tools, linens, serving pieces and spices clean and dry no matter what 
mother nature throws at them.&quot;</p> 
<p>There are too many models to describe here, so let's just drool over the 
top of the line,<strong>the 900GS</strong>. Practically everything is made from 
heavy 304 stainless. It has 100,000 BTU for the 864 square inch custom cut 
stainless steel grates, plus a 22,000 BTU rotisserie burner, a 22,000 searing 
burner, and a 32,000 wok-ready side burner. Kalamazoo claims the bow-ties 
shaped stainless burners are capable of 800&deg;F guaranteed for life. There 
are two smoke trays, and you can order a pretty nifty looking cabinet style 
offset smoker box with shelves for charcoal, and water. Even the wheels are 
heavy duty. Normally myGold Awards are reserved for products that are a balance 
of quality and price, and nobody will ever call Kalamazoo grills bargains, but 
the get the prize on quality features alone. Click here for more info and

<h2>Kenmore</h2> 
<p>Kenmore is the Sears house brand, and the nameplate seems to be on other 
manufacturer's products.</p> 
<h2>Lynx</h2> 
<p>Lynx is big in the outdoor kitchen concept with a line of five base units 
available as cabinet mounted and built-in models from 685 to 1110 inches of 
primary cooking services. They also sell side burners, warming drawers, 
refrigerators, beer taps, ice machines, beverage dispensers, patio heaters, and 
beverage stations. The grills use long lasting brass burners, cool blue lights 
above the knobs, halogen grill surface light, a lid lift assist system that 
uses a seesaw-like balance, stainless steel grilling grates,, wood chip box. As 
you move up the line you can get a rotisserie, and sear burners. A brief 
discussion of the heating system is useful. Brass is a fine burner, and is 
practically indestructible. Above the burners they place ceramic briquets, a 
system popular several decades ago, but abandoned by many manufacturers because 
the briquets occasionally need replacing. They are not the best system for even 
distribution of heat, and grease buildup on them occasionally flares up, but I 
like the flavor they produce. Click here for more info and pricing:Lynx<em>. -

<h2>Master Forge Gas Grills</h2> 
<p>Sold only at Lowe's, Master Forge offers a lot of grill for little money by 
using inexpensive materials, construction, and components. While researching 
products I like to cruise the web and look for comments by owners. Many owners 
raised concerns about construction, customer service, availability of parts, 
and the fact that the brand is only a few years old and still unproven in the 
market. On the other hand, many Master Forge owners love their grills and are 
eager to post praise. Additionally, Consumer Reports 2012 Buying Guide gives 
the Master Forge 5-Burner Grill a &quot;Very Good&quot; rating and top pick for 
large model gas grills. So what's the deal?</p> 
<p>The Master Forge gas grill line is extensive, from a small tabletop all the 
way up to an 8' long, 115,500 BTU, 8 burner, stainless steel deck barge that 
costs less than a Weber 4 burner Summit. And you get features out the wazoo: 
side burners, sear burners, warming/steaming stations, LED illuminated knobs, 
halogen lights in the lid, towel racks, fold-out tables; one model even has a 
built-in bottle opener!</p> 
<p>The steel is thin, and some parts just looked cheap, like the plastic 
control knobs and the thermometers. As always, we strongly recommend you not 
rely on dial thermometers, and that you purchase agood digital thermometer to 
get accurate oven temp readings. Manufacturers would serve us better by 
replacing cheap dial thermometers with bottle openers. Nonetheless, overall 
quality was in line with other low cost grills. This is an important point. 
It's not useful to compare Master Forge to high end brands like Weber. Compare 
them to Brinkmann. However, if you're looking for economy and are considering 
other low cost grills, Master Forge may sweeten the deal with all the extras. 
Then ask yourself how long do you think it will last? Will you be replacing it 
in 5 years? The bargain price may not be such a bargain in that light.</p> 
<p>Lowe's, like Wal-Mart and other big box retailers, carries popular brands 
and also has private label products made for them. This operation is managed by 
a division of Lowe's named LG Sourcing. Lowe's seems to have offered various 
grill lines for several years under various names like &quot;Perfect 
Flame&quot; and made by various companies like &quot;BBQtek&quot;. Currently, 
Master Forge is manufactured by Sagittarius Sporting Goods headquartered in 
Taiwan. I have to wonder how the happy Master Forge owners mentioned above will 
feel about their grill in a few more years, particularly if Lowe's changes 
their BBQ line again. Any Perfect Flame owners out there care to comment?</p> 
<p>I compiled a list of questions and called Lowe&iacute;s to speak with a 
product manager. There was no Master Forge product manager. I ended up talking 
to someone in Public Relations. She wrote down my questions to present to the 
right person, but she wouldn't let me talk to that person. She'd get back to me 
with answers. The following day she sent an email that said nothing of value 
and answered none of my questions. If this is the way they handle media 
inquiries from the world's most popular barbecue and grilling website, I 
shudder to think what customer service is like.</p> 
<p><strong>LP Tabletop Grill</strong> has a single U-shaped burner generating 
12,000 BTUs, small folding legs, a locking lid for travel and a push button 
igniter. Stainless Steel body and grate with a 217 square inch cooking surface. 
The compact configuration by necessity brings the heat up close to the grate 
for a good sear on your burgers and steaks. Some owners reported igniter and 
regulator malfunctions. Be sure to position this grill to allow the propane 
tank to stand upright. This igniter is piezoelectric. The rest of the Master 
Forge gas grill line includes battery powered electronic ignition and lid 
thermometers.</p> 
<p><strong>2 Burner Grill</strong> is great for an apartment, balcony or small 
deck. The left and right side tables fold down for easy storage. Two P-shaped 
stainless steel burners produce 30,000 BTUs. Grates are porcelain-coated cast 
iron with a 346 square inch of primary cooking area and 109 square inches on 
the warming rack. Construction is black porcelain-coated steel with double wall 
lid, cast aluminum end caps and a single door enclosed cart.</p> 
<p><strong>4 Burner Grill</strong> has 4 stainless steel burners for 48,000 
BTUs, porcelain-coated cast iron grates with 480 square inches of primary 
cooking surface and 188 square inch on the warming rack. This also features 
folding side tables and a single door cart.</p> 
<p><strong>4 Burner Green Gas Grill</strong> (right) has a neat look with its 
hunter green and black porcelain and powder-coated steel body and split lid. 
One side houses three stainless steel burners at 12,000 BTUs each and the other 
houses a 13,000 BTU sear burner. Porcelain-coated cast iron grates for 535 
square inches of primary cooking and 168 square inches on the warming rack. The 
sear burner is smallish, accommodating perhaps two modest size steaks. Double 
wall lids and double door enclosed cart. Also includes an 11,000 BTU side 
burner, side shelf handle, attached condiment boxes, tool holder and a bottle 
opener! Natural gas conversion kit available.</p> 
<p><strong>4 Burner Stainless Steel</strong> looks pretty in the picture and 
on the showroom floor, but remember: Even high quality stainless steel needs to 
be maintained to keep that fabulous shine. If you cover this grill and polish 
it periodically, it will still be prone to discoloration and corrosion. It has 
four 304 stainless steel burners burning 48,000 BTUs and one 13,500 BTU side 
burner. Stainless Steel grates with a total cooking area of 444 square inches 
of primary cooking area and 125 square inches on the warming rack. Throw in two 
stainless steel side shelves and a double walled stainless steel hood. Natural 
gas conversion kit available.</p> 
<p><strong>5 Burner Grill</strong>. The model Consumer Reports rated 
&quot;Very Good&quot; has 5 stainless steel burners for 60,000 BTUs, one 12,000 
BTU sear burner, one 12,000 BTU side burner, 576 square inches of primary 
cooking on stainless steel grates and 211 square inch warming tray. Inside is a 
13,000 BTU rotisserie burner back by the warming tray, two halogen lid-lights 
and LEDs above each control knob. A unique feature is the pull-out table that 
wants to stay pulled out. I collapsed the table and tried to latch it shut with 
no success. Some owners complained about this so keep it in mind during 
assembly. I believe the latch has a very narrow tolerance. Master Forge offers 
a variation on this theme that appears identical except the retractable table 
has a slightly different design.</p> 
<p><strong>Modular Brown 5-Burner Grill with Modular Sink/Bar</strong>. The 
grill module has four cast iron burners (!), an IR sear burner and IR 
rotisserie burner for a total of 70,000 BTUs. 618 square inches of stainless 
steel primary cooking grates on a large cart with three stainless steel doors 
and brown coated metal cabinet. The sink module mirrors the grill in size and 
look with the same combo of stainless and brown coated metal. Both have granite 
counter tops. The sink includes a granite splash guard with a 
&igrave;bar&icirc; on top. Of course there is an under mount sink with bar 
faucet, two drawers and one door that presumably encloses stored beverages. You 
also get a 13,000 BTU cast iron griddle and two 12,000 BTU stove top burners. 
In-lid halogens on the grill and LED illuminated knobs all around. A natural 
gas conversion kit and custom cover are included at no extra charge. The Lowe's 
2011 Grill Buying guide completes this set with a matching 2.1 cubic foot 
outdoor rated refrigerator.</p> 
<p><strong>8 Burner Grill</strong>. Invite the whole neighborhood when you 
fire up this beast: five stainless steel burners, two side by side brass 
burners, a &quot;sear top with warming station&quot; and one IR sear burner for 
a total of 115,500 BTUs. Thankfully a natural gas conversion kit is also 
included as well as a custom cover. All stainless steel construction with a 
double wall hood and quick disconnect side burners. Stainless steel grates for 
684 square inches of primary cooking and 264 square inches of warming rack. 
Control knob LEDs, in-lid halogen lights, slide out tank tray and trash bag 
holder complete the package. At eight feet long, with three doors and two pull 
out drawers, this unit is mighty big. In fact the oversize lid is too big to 
accommodate a rotisserie. Who would want or need such a large grill you ask? 
There were quite a few reviews for this unit at Lowe&iacute;s website and 
almost all were five stars.</p> 
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>. The good news is you get a lot for what you 
pay. Everything with the Master Forge name on it is low cost. For example, a 
Master Forge rotisserie kit is $35 compared to the Weber Genesis kit for $80. 
The bad news is you usually get what you pay for. Only time will tell.<em> -

<p>A small number of grills that I have never seen and a website that offers 
little info.</p> 
<h2>Solaire</h2> 
<p>Solaire grills are mostly infrared radiation, but a few offer both infrared

<h2>Stok Grills</h2> 
<p>Although Stok Grills were a fun idea with matching orange colors, a 
different design concept involving various cooking tool inserts and even 
branded apparel, Home Depot stores liquidated everything they had in stock for 
lower and lower prices until most stores are sold out. They are now available 
on the Home Depot website at full price for online orders only. I asked Stok 
Public Relations if the line is being discontinued. They promised to get back 
with an answer, but have not. Regardless of quality and performance, Stok looks 
destined for the boneyard. If you can find a Home Depot that is giving one away 
(I heard of stupid deals like mark downs from $399 to $79), you may want take a 
chance. Otherwise, sit back and let the ash settle. 3/11/2012<em> - Max Good

<h2><strong>Sunshine Grill</strong></h2> 
<p>Cast iron gas grills, four burners, and griddle. Features include wok 
adapter, easy cleaning, and the meat is only two inches from the flames.</p> 
<h2><strong>Surefire</strong></h2> 
<p>They make a wide range of sizes, all stainless steel, designed to burn 
propane, natural gas, or lump charcoal with an optional charcoal tray.</p> 
<h2><strong>TEC</strong></h2> 
<p>Thermal Engineering Corporation (TEC) is the company that pioneered the 
concept of &quot;infrared&quot; grilling. They make commercial grills, pedestal 
grills, and cart mounted units. Practically everything is high quality 304 
stainless, and built in their Columbia, SC, plant. Their unique cooking system 
begins with stainless steel burners. Just above the burners is a solid layer of 
special glass that absorbs and distributes the heat evenly. The stainless steel 
grates are just above the glass. The glass blocks air flow so there is strictly 
radiant heat and minimal drying from convection heat. Drippings from marinades 
hit the glass and vaporize infusing flavor into the food, and wood can be 
tossed on the glass for smoke. TECs have removable interior trim panels for 
easier cleaning. There is no need for side burners. You can boil water on the 
grates. All TECs have natural gas adapter kits available.</p>

<h2>Vidalia Grills</h2> 
<p>One of the most clever designs I've seen. It is divided in two, a direct 
heat zone and an indirect heat zone. The indirect zone has a water pan under it 
(they incorrectly call this a marinade pan, but now I'm nitpicking). Exhaust 
openings are below the grates so smoke must travel across the food. The flavor 
bars over the heating elements can be lifted out as a unit and the water pan 
can slide over the heat to steam or boil. They even claim you can cook with 
charcoal or wood by putting briquets or logs on the flavor bars and igniting 
them with the gas burners. They have four models, 2', 3', 4' and 6' wide 
cooking surfaces. The 2' unit is 21 1/2&quot; deep, all the rest are 2' deep. 
All are built from stainless steel and aluminum, they are available as pedestal 
or built-in, and all can be either propane or natural gas. No rotisserie 
available.</p>

<h2>Viking</h2> 
<p>Sells a nice range of cart mounted and built-in stainless steel grills. 
Expensive.</p> 
<h2>Weber</h2> 
<p>Weber gas grills are simply the gold standard as well as winner of 
Meatheads Gold Medal. Designed intelligently with attention to details and 
built to last, they look good, work beautifully, and almost never break down. 
If they do, Weber is known for great customer service and for carrying an 
inventory of parts on models from years gone by. My 15-year old Genesis and I 
know from experience.</p> 
<p>All their burners are quality stainless steel, have a long life expectancy, 
and they come with electronic ignitions. The body is heavy. The casters are 
sturdy and lock solid. Nothing wobbles on Webers. The grease drip pans are easy 
to access from the front, not the back as with many other grills. All models 
hold the propane tank inside the enclosed cart, and all can be adapted for 
natural gas. They have smaller vents in the hood than most gassers which means 
they retain more heat than grills with more BTUs.</p> 
<p>All have inverted V shaped &quot;flavorizer&quot; bars that cover the 
burners and protect them while vaporizing drips and turning them into flavor 
that gets back up into the meat. All either come with a rotisserie or you 
canorder one as a factory accessory, though one thing must be said about the 
Weber rotisseries: They are skewer, not basket, type. They are tricky and prone 
to rotating and failing to rotate the meat. I prefer basket type which they 
used to sell.</p> 
<p>Weber gas grills come in three basic flavors, Spirit, Genesis, and Summit, 
each with several configurations. Models starting with an &quot;E&quot; are 
built with Weber's sturdy porcelainized enamel coated steel, and those starting 
with an &quot;S&quot; are mostly stainless steel. The Spirit line is built in 
China, while the Genesis and Summit lines are made in IL.</p> 
<p>The biggest barrier for many folks is price. Webers are not cheap, but when 
you consider that they last decades, the price is easy to justify. In fact, 
when you consider the fact that some cheap grills fall apart after 3 years or 
so, Webers might be considered a bargain.</p> 
<p>My only complaint: All Webers have the obligatory bi-metal dial thermometer 
in the hood that gives you a ballpark reading of what the temperature is high 
above the meat. Since we cook on the grates, though, it's always better to bring
your own digital grill thermometer and place a probe there. It would be nice if 
they would go digital in the digital age.</p> 
<h2>Weber Spirit Grills</h2> 
<p>The Spirit line is Weber's entry level and the least expensive in the 
catalog. The E-210 has two burners, while the E-310 and E-320 have three 
burners, running left to righ and lined up from front to rear. This 
configuration is especially good for rotisserie cooking, but not as convenient 
for2-Zone or Indirect cooking as when the burners line up from side to side. 
But it can be done.</p> 
<p>They all have a small stainless work shelf on the left, and on the right 
shelf are the burner controls and tool hooks. Ignition is battery operated 
electric. The main grates are porcelain-enamel coated. The lightish hood is 
made of porcelain-enameled steel and the handles on the magnetically-held lower 
doors are plastic, as is the handle on the hood. The only color available is 
black.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-210</strong> has 350 square inches of primary cooking surface 
and a 108 square inch removable warming rack for 458 total square inches, 
enough for small family grilling. Two stainless steel burners put out 26,000 
BTU, and the design features well-placed, well-measured vents that let air flow 
without the draft snuffing the flames.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-310</strong> has three burners rated at 36,000 BTUs, 424 
square inches of primary cooking area and 112 on the warming rack, giving you a 
total of 536 square cooking inches.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-320</strong> is the same as the 310, but includes a 12,000 
BTU side burner hidden in the left side table.</p> 
<h2>Weber Genesis Grills</h2> 
<p>The Genesis was totally redesigned for 2011 by moving the gas control knobs 
from the side to the front, and with them the three burners now line up from 
side to side running front to rear rather than lining up front to rear and 
running left to right as they did in the past. This makes the right shelf 
available for workspace and makes2-Zone or Indirect cooking much easier. The 
Genesis models also have a second layer of metal under the hood with an air gap 
between for extra insulation. This helps insulate the cooking space, amping up 
the heat.</p> 
<p>There are three basic configurations, the 310, 320, and 330. The E models 
are available in green, copper, black. The natural gas model comes in any color 
you want, so long as it is black. Both side tables have aluminum endcaps. The S 
version is stainless steel. The E and S versions come standard with 
porcelain-enamel coated cast iron cooking grates, a fine system, and 
porcelain-enamel coated flavorizer bars. The EP models have stainless steel 
cooking grates and stainless steel Flavorizer bars, and there are two 
additional colors, brick red and steel gray.</p> 
<p>All models can be bought with add-on cabinets that nestle under the side 
tables as an option. They also come with table extensions. The cabinets have 
adjustable wire shelves.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-310, EP-310, and S-310</strong> have 507 square inches on the 
primary surface and 130 on the upper rack. It spreads 38,000 BTU among three 
burners.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-320 and EP-320</strong> (there is no S-320) has a 12,000 BTU 
flush mounted side burner on the right.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-330, EP 320, and S-330</strong> has a fourth burner on the 
left that adds another 10,000 BTU to boost the heat on that side for searing. 
The Sear Station is a dedicated area which Weber claims can reach 700 to 
800&deg;F. The extra burner, when fired up in tandem with flanking burners on 
high makes restaurant-quality sear marks. When the sear burner is turned off, 
the grate returns to normal cooking area, unlike some grills that have a 
special part of the grate that can only be used for searing. The E series has 
porcelain-enameled cooking grates and the S series features 7 mm diameter 
stainless steel cooking grates. Sturdy, easy to clean, and excellent at 
transferring heat from your fire to the meat for good grill marks. Both have 6

<h2>Weber Summit Grills</h2> 
<p>The top of the line Webers come in several different configurations, the 
420, 470, 620, 660, and 670. Let's see if we can sort them out for you.</p> 
<p>All of them have stainless steel flavorizer bars, serious 3/8 inch (9 mm) 
diameter stainless steel rod cooking grates, a double layer of steel under the 
hood for extra insulation, and 12,000 BTU flush-mounted side burners. Don't ask 
me why, but the E models are available only in black.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-420 and S-420</strong> have four burners lined up side to 
side, a 48,000 BTU spread over a 538 square inch grate, and a 12,000 BTU side 
burner. There are six tool hooks, and an LED light on the handle that shines on 
the cooking surface.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-470 and S-470</strong> have a cleverly designed built-in 
rotisserie with a motor that drops down into the side shelf and hides. There is 
a 10,600 BTU rear-mounted burner just for the rotisserie. There is also a 
10,600 BTU sear burner in the center. The primary cooking area is 468 square 
inches, and the warming rack is 112 square inches. An especially nice touch: 
The knobs are illuminated and there is an illuminated scale that shows you 
about how much fuel is in your propane tank. There is also a smoker box with 
its own burner on the right.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-620 and S-620</strong> has 6 main burners upping the power to 
60,000 BTU spread out over 693 square inches, and a 145 square inch warming 
rack. An extra handle light has been added to illuminate all this real estate. 
The side burner is also amped up to 12,000 BTU. There is no sear burner or 
built-in rotisserie as on the 470.</p> 
<p><strong>The E-670 and S-670</strong> is the top of the line. The primary 
grate is 624 square inches, and the warming rack is 145 square inches. This 
baby has BTUs galore: The primary burners put out 60,000 BTU, there is a 12,000 
BTU flush-mounted side burner, a 10,600 BTU sear burner, a 10,600 BTU infrared 
rear-mounted rotisserie burner, and they have added a dedicated 6,800 BTU 
burner for the smoker box.</p> 
<p><strong>The S-460 and S-660</strong> (there is no E-660) is the model 
designed to be built into outdoor kitchens. There are side tables, so there is 
no side burner or hidden rotisserie. It has no casters, but slides in and out 
of the counter system. Otherwise the S-460 is configured pretty much the same 
as the S-470 model above. It is 34&quot; wide, 31&quot; deep, and 49.5&quot; 
tall. The S-660 is comparable to the S-670 above. It is 42&quot; wide, 31&quot; 
deep, and 49.5&quot; tall. Click here for more info and pricing:Weber<em>. -

<h1> Read this before posting a comment please:</h1> 
<p>1) If you are looking for info, please use the table of contents or the 
search box, at the top of every page.</p> 
<p>2) Don't ask me any questions that involve temp or time unless you tell me 
that you are using a digital thermometer! Bi-metal dial thermometers are often 
off by as much as 50&deg;F! If you are not using a good digital you have no 
idea what the temp really is so I can't help you. If you are still using a dial 
thermometer, please read this article about thermometers, then buy a good 
digital, and then, if the problem persists (chances are it won't), hit me with 
your questions.Then, please tell me <em>everything</em> I need to know to 
answer your question. Like the type of cooker you are using. Remember, I am not 
a mind reader.</p> 
<p>3) Please don't ask me &quot;What grill (or smoker) should I buy?&quot; 
Read myBuyer's Guides and the buying checklists and follow the links. I've 
shared just about everything I know. Pay attention to the awards I have given 
my faves. I cannot pick the right cooker for you any more than I could pick the 
right car or spouse for you.</p> 
<p>4) If you have problems posting with Internet Explorer, please read this. 
If problems persist,send me a note.</p>

 AmazingRibs.com Best in BBQ Gold Medal Winners</h2> <strong>Here are 
some great products that have earnedThe</strong> <strong> AmazingRibs.com Best 
in BBQ Gold Medals. These are not ads!</strong> 
<p>Meat Temp Fridge Magnet</p> 
<p>The prize for Best BBQ Tool at the 2012 The National Barbecue Association 
conference went to a simple inexpensive fridge magnet by Meathead. It includes 
the latest USDA recommendations as well as chef recommendations (and they often 
differ) as well as color photos of the different stages of doneness for red 
meats. The temperatures are the same for both indoor and outdoor cooks.Click 
here for more info and how to order it.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h2>GrillGrates Take You To The Infrared Zone</h2> 
<p>GrillGrates are the best new product I have tested in years and the best 
thing to happen to beef since salt and pepper. The base superheats, eliminates 
hot spots, and blocks flareups. This is the concept behind the expensive new 
infrared grills. A must for gas grills.Click here for more about GrillGrates.
</p> <br>

<h2>The Smokenator: A Necessity For All Weber Kettles</h2> 
<p>If you have a Weber Kettle, you need the amazing Smokenator and Hovergrill. 
The Smokenator turns your grill into a first class smoker, and the Hovergrill 
can add capacity or be used to create steakhouse steaks.Click here to read more.
</p> 
<h2><strong>ThermoWorks Pocket Thermometer - No More Guessing</strong></h2> 
<p>A good thermometer is why I never serve overcooked or undercooked food. 
This one has a very thin tip with a tiny thermocouple so it gives an accurate 
reading in just six seconds. I cannot recommend it more highly. It will improve 
your cooking overnight and pay for itself in a hurry. And it is inexpensive. 
Click here for more aboutthermometers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Steakhouse Knives</p> 
<p>These are the same knives used at the best steakhouses (Peter Luger, Smith 
&amp; Wollensky, Morton's and others). Machine washable, temper-ground, 
serrated, high-carbon stainless-steel, full-tang blades with excellent cutting 
edge retention, beefy hardwood handle, rust and stain resistant, and they stay 
shiny without polishing. And now they have the AmazingRibs.com imprimatur.Click 
here for more info on these wonderful knives.</p>
