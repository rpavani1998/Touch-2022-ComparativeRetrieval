<h2>Charcoal Barbecues &amp; Gas Barbecue Grills - FAQ's</h2> 
<p>Here at Big K we are often asked which is best; charcoal barbeques or gas 
barbecue grills? We have produced the following FAQ section to help you make 
your own mind up, as to which type of barbecue is best suited to you.</p> 
<h3>What are the different types of barbecue?</h3> 
<p>There are a number of different types of barbecue available, including 
disposable barbecues, traditionalcharcoal barbecues and gas barbecue grills. 
Each has its own advantages. Disposable barbecues are easy to use, highly 
portable and cheap, but they are only for single use and you have very little 
control over the cooking temperature. Charcoal barbecues create a 'smoky' 
taste, it is easier to manage the temperature of the coals but you do have to 
wait for the coals to heat up until they are ready to cook on. Gas barbecue 
grills are easy to light and you can control the heat easily. They are ready to 
cook on sooner than charcoal barbecues, and they are cleaner as they do not 
produce as much soot and smoke.</p> 
<h3>Which type of bbq is more environmentally friendly, gas or charcoal?</h3> 
<p>Both gas barbecues and charcoal bbqs are environmentally friendly but with 
a charcoal barbecue, it is important to burn smokeless fuels. Gas barbecues 
produce less smoke and soot than charcoal, wood or coal fired barbecues but 
there are environmental issues with regard the production and transport of the 
gas.</p> 
<h3>Why use the barbecue lid when cooking?</h3> 
<p>Closing the lid when cooking on a barbecue will keep the heat in and keep 
the barbecue at a constant temperature. This will ensure the food is cooked 
thoroughly and evenly.</p> 
<h3>How does a gas barbecue work?</h3> 
<p>Gas barbecues burn gas from a gas cylinder. This means that gas barbecues 
are ready to cook more quickly. The burners on a gas barbecue are also evenly 
spaced giving an all over, even heat. A gas barbecue can also be extinguished 
immediately by turning off the gas supply and stopping the flow of gas to the 
burners.</p> 
<h3>How do I light a gas barbecue?</h3> 
<p>Lighting a gas barbecue is as simple as lighting a gas hob in the kitchen. 
Ensure that the gas is flowing and the regulator is switched to the &lsquo;on' 
position, turn up the burner to a low flow of gas and light it using Big K's 
big matches or an oven lighter. You can then regulate the amount of heat 
produced using the gas supply regulators.</p> 
<h3>How do you clean a gas barbecue?</h3> 
<p>Wait until the gas barbecue has cooled sufficiently to touch it and then 
clean the grill using a non-abrasive cleaning material such as a soft sponge or 
cloth. Combine this with a non-abrasive detergent or soap and rinse with water 
until the grill is free from food debris and grease.</p> 
<h3>What food can I cook on a gas barbecue?</h3> 
<p>You can cook any food on a gas barbecue that you would cook on a charcoal 
barbecue.</p> 
<h3>How do I disconnect a gas canister from a barbecue?</h3> 
<p>Ensure that the barbecue flame is extinguished, close the tap on the gas 
canister and switch the gas regulator to the 'OFF' position. Then unscrew the 
pipe from the canister and remove it from the barbecue.</p> 
<h3>Can I use charcoal in my gas barbecue?</h3> 
<p>No, they are very different types of barbecue and you are likely to damage 
the gas burners if you burn charcoal on them.</p> 
<h3>How does a charcoal barbecue work?</h3> 
<p>Charcoal barbecues burn charcoal to generate their heat. Charcoal barbecues 
work in much the same way as fires do; air is drawn up through the coal which 
helps to breathe life into the flames. When hot enough, the coals will turn 
white on top whilst glowing red underneath. This is a sign that your charcoal 
barbeque is ready to cook on.</p> 
<h3>How do I light a charcoal barbecue?</h3> 
<p>Use Big K's big matches or Big K's firelighters and kindling to get the 
charcoal briquettes burning. Once alight, spread them evenly across the face of 
the barbeque so as to produce as even a flame as possible.</p> 
<h3>How do I clean a charcoal barbecue?</h3> 
<p>The best way to clean a charcoal barbeque is to brush the grilling surface 
down with a wire brush whilst it is still quite hot. Leave the grill surface in 
place whilst you brush it, that way any food debris or grease can be freed from 
the grill and left to burn away in the grill pit. Then, when the barbecue grill 
surface has completely cooled, remove it to the sink and wash it down with a 
cloth and soapy water, then rinse. Take this opportunity to empty the grill pit 
of ash and debris, this will ensure trouble free fire lighting for your next 
barbecue party.</p> 
<h3>What food can I cook on a charcoal barbecue?</h3> 
<p>You can cook any food on a charcoal barbecue that you would cook on a gas 
barbeque and some people prefer the smokier taste that a charcoal barbecue 
produces.</p> 
<h3>How do I plan a great barbecue party?</h3> 
<p>Planning a great barbecue or garden party can be lots of fun. First it's a 
matter of choosing the right day. The weather plays an important role in the 
success and enjoyment of a barbeque party so try to choose a day which is 
likely to be warm and sunny. Invite the right group of people and give them 
plenty of notice to ensure they'll be able to make it. Then it's all about the 
catering; the beauty of barbecuing is that you can never have too much food or 
drink. If you have over catered, simply store the surplus in the fridge or 
freezer for another time or cook it all up, barbecued food is delicious in 
sandwiches or as light bites, whatever the weather.</p> <br>
