<p>Brinkmann Dual Zone Charcoal Gas Grill Model # 810-3820-S</p> The Brinkmann 
Corporation <br>
<br>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  Over the years several companies have attempted to 
blend the convenience of gas with the flavor of charcoal. Recently there have 
been a few side by side grills. Basically this version is two grills, one gas 
and one charcoal mounted together on a single cart. Add in a side burner, 
albeit a weak one and you have what would appear to be a complete package, and 
all for about $300USD. Sound too good to be true? Well it should. The real 
question is, do you really need this 5 foot long, 120 pound all in one grill or 
would you be better served with separate grills. The truth is that this grill 
isn't that well built. Manufacturer's Site <br>

<h3>Guide Review - Brinkmann Dual Zone Charcoal Gas Grill </h3>  This model 
has been discontinued.Brinkmann Dual Zone Charcoal Gas Grill Model# 810-3821-S. 
<p>This gas/charcoal dual grill is almost an exact copy of the Char-Griller Duo
 that sells at Lowe's Home Improvement Stores. Obviously Home Depot felt they 
were missing something so they got Brinkmann to make this grill to the almost 
exact specifications. This Brinkmann model as Home Depot is such a blatant 
knockoff of the Char-Griller Duo sold at Lowe's that you would think it would 
be too embarrassing to put out on the showroom floor. Since the competition 
between Home Depot and Lowe's is so tight it would appear that they have to 
carry the same products, for the same price, but from different companies. The 
person who buys this grill probably didn't do their research and most likely 
bought it on impulse.</p> 
<p>The gas grill side is a 36,00 BTU 3-burner gas grill with medium weight 
porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates and a low powered, 10,000 BTU side 
burner. While some of these components are not the best quality they are not 
necessarily that bad for the price. The BTU output is low for the size (the 
Char-Griller version has 40,800 BTUs), but the barrel shape and thicker steel 
body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power. Other than 
this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.</p> 
<p>On the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill. The 
cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom 
holds in the heat and protects the painted finish. While relatively small this 
charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is limited in 
indirect grilling space.</p> 
<p>The questions you should be asking yourself is do you really need both a 
charcoal and a gas grill and if you do would it make more sense to buy one of 
each separately. After all if the gas components of this grill rust out and 
make that side useless you have a 5 foot long charcoal grill with limited 
cooking area. My recommendation would be to purchase aWeber Charcoal Grill for 
around $100 that will last you a good decade and perhaps a lower endChar-Broil 
Gas Grill for around $150 that will last a few years. </p> Manufacturer's Site

<strong>Falls 
apart</strong>, Member jsdanow1 
<p>I purchased one exactly 4-months ago. First the girll was not put together 
properly by Home Depot, then there is a part on the lid that breaks. It 
happened twice. So I am working to get a credit from Home Depot to get 
something else. The lids do not seal and the gas does not come out evenly. Look 
else where.</p> Write a review
