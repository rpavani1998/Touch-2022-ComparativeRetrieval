<h2>How to Barbecue Safely</h2> 
<p>by Mesquite Pete</p> 
<p>Nearly everyone enjoys cooking outdoors over their barbecue grill. Some 
enjoy gas grills and there are those who prefer charcoal over gas. However, 
regardless of your preference, there are a few simple tricks to make your 
barbecue cooking safer in various ways.</p> 
<p>When it comes to grill safety, it isn&rsquo;t always about not being 
burned. In fact, there are many things which can harm you during barbecue 
cooking, including food poisoning. Here are a few tips to make sure you or your 
guests do not suffer from food poisoning from cooking outdoors.</p> 
<p>One of the most common mistakes people make when barbecue cooking, is the 
choice of when to add sauce to the meat. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is 
beef, chicken or pork, each type of meat must be thoroughly cooked.</p> 
<p>This will ensure the cooking process kills any bacteria that can cause food 
borne illness. It is common practice to lather on the sauce, before putting the 
meat on the grill. Many people do this because they believe it will better 
enhance the flavor of your food.</p> 
<p>However, when it comes to food safety, this is possibly the worst thing you 
can do. What happens is, most cooks will use a barbecue brush to brush their 
favorite barbecue sauce onto the raw meat.</p> 
<p>This means any bacteria that was present on the uncooked meat, will be on 
the brush when it is placed in the container of sauce. This quickly 
contaminates the entire container. After the meat continues to cook and more 
sauce is added, the cook is adding the bacteria back onto the partially cooked 
meat.</p> 
<p>This process can go on and on, simply spreading the bacteria onto the meat 
with each additional application of sauce. To reduce this possibility, the best 
method is to fully cook the meat first, then add the sauce in the last few 
minutes of cooking. This will retain the flavor of the sauce, without 
contaminating the food.</p> 
<p>In addition, it will help you keep from burning the ribs due to the high 
content of sugar in the sauce. If you are afraid of adding cold sauce to the 
hot meat, you can place the container of sauce on the grill and heat it up 
while the meat is cooking and then brush it onto the cooked meat.</p> 
<p>To eliminate the possibility of food illnesses during barbecuing, you 
should also use a different plate to place the cooked food on. For example, do 
not use the same plate to hold the cooked meat as you did to bring the uncooked 
meat out to the grill.</p> 
<p>Juices from the uncooked meat will still have contaminates on it and by 
placing the cooked food on the same plate will transfer the bacteria onto the 
cooked food. This will greatly increase the chances of making your guests ill.
</p> 
<p>Remember, barbecue safety doesn&rsquo;t only rely on trying not to burn 
yourself. Using safe cooking practices is also a huge part of being safe while 
barbecuing.</p>  This was added on Tuesday, September 6th, 2011 at 6:59 pm and
