<h1>Gas Charcoal Grills</h1> <br>
<br>

<p>Gas charcoal grills are dual purpose grills that allow you to have the best 
of both worlds. Charcoal is preferred by many outdoor cooks for meat, but the 
separate gas grill allows you to cook all your side dishes right along with 
your grilled meats. No more running back and forth between the kitchen and 
patio to complete your meal. When all your kitchen helpers disappear, you can 
handle it all yourself with a dual purpose combination grill.</p> 
<p>Gas charcoal grills come in different sizes. Some models are only 
marginally larger than an average grill. Others, such as the twin chamber 
charcoal and gas grills, are a bit larger. The larger models are excellent 
choices for a complete outdoor kitchen. They are perfect for beside the pool, 
at the lake house or any other spot where people like to gather. With a propane 
tank and charcoal, there is no need to run electrical or gas wiring from the 
house to the outdoor kitchen.</p> 
<p>Gas charcoal grills can be found at many home improvement stores and on the 
Internet. Many models are not much more expensive than a regular quality 
charcoal grill. Be sure to select a quality model with good construction. You 
want to check for a tight sealing lid or door. Be sure that the grill racks 
will stay in place when you are working with food on them. Models with separate 
lids or doors for each side will help you keep the temperature regulated while 
working with food on either side.</p> <br>
