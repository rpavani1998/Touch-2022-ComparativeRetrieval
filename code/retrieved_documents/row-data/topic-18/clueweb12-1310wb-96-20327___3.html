Charcoal..Wet heat vs Dry Heat</strong> <br>
After much research and wiki 
articles I was able to find some evidence as to the possible reason why many 
seem to prefer a charcoal grill over a Gas grill. LP Gas creates a large amount 
of water vapor when it ignites and creates what is known as &#147;Wet 
heat&#148; which is said to be a poor choice for cooking lean tender cuts of 
steak and should only be used for roasts and tougher cuts of meat that are 
often Braised or Stewed because of the amounts of collagen that needs to be 
broken down. Because of this I am guessing that the Maillard reaction is 
difficult at best to obtain with wet heat from a Gas Grill using direct open 
flame where the water vapor is directly exposed to the cooking surface  (Wiki 
quote) &#147;propane burns to form water and carbon dioxide &#148; <br>
<br>

The fact that many can&#146;t tell the difference between Gas and Charcoal and 
why some serious outdoor cooks claim a better flavor with charcoal may be 
because of the following: <br>
<br>
My guess as to why many can&#146;t tell the 
difference has nothing to do with the charcoal flavor but has to do with the 
Maillard reaction  and subsequent caramelization that is far easier to achieve 
with dry heat cooking. Most haven&#146;t learned to properly sear a steak to 
begin with nor do they even know how and why to do it, so many of these tests 
are probably invalid if the test cooks don&#146;t know any better. Personally I 
can tell a pronounced difference and more complex flavor and texture when the 
Maillard reaction has been properly achieved. The contrast between the crispy 
flavorful exterior and the tender juicy soft interior is what makes a great 
steak truly special and different. People don&#146;t put enough stock into 
texture or maybe many are not that sensitive to texture but it has as much to 
do with taste as flavor, temperature, smell and looks do. As for the smoke 
flavor I don&#146;t think it is all that pertinent since it is well known that 
smoking wood chips can be done on both types of grills and smoke flavor should 
overpower and obscure any hardwood lump charcoal flavoring which is also a 
smoke flavor. <br>
<br>
<br>
This is probably why no top chef at any 
respectable restaurant will use a gas grill, most will pan sear and finish off 
in an oven, both of which are &#147;Dry&#148; heat. A charcoal grill will give 
you dry heat as well but the difficulties of heat control and the extra time of 
waiting on the coals to reach optimum temperature is more of a pain then most 
busy kitchens can afford. The only 4 star restaurant near me (The Mansion at 
Turtle Creek Dallas) uses of all things, a Hasty bake charcoal oven for their 
award winning steaks and their one of only a few top high rated restaurant that 
bother with charcoal at all. <br>
<br>
So technically if you want the best 
prime cooked steak it will either be done on a stovetop and finished in the 
oven or on a charcoal grill with someone who really knows what their doing and 
how to sear properly. BTW, wide grate spacing makes it very difficult. <br>
<br>
In addition, searing does not seal in the juices, that is a myth, in fact it 
does the opposite. Searing only tastes better because of the Maillard reaction. 
Achieving a juicer cut of steak is done by letting the meat set for a short 
period which will allow the juices that have moved to the middle of the meat 
redistribute throughout the meat evenly which keeps much of the juices from 
running out when it is cut. <br>
<br>
Sorry I couldnt site the links that 
support my research, but the forum rules wont let me so I had to edit all of 
them out, and there were several good ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, thanks to the 
grill guruat the Grill Shoppe in Fort Worth for educating me on this, and 
getting me interested enough to study about this subject enough to find some 
supporting evidence on the Internet. <br>

the moisture aspect of cooking on a gas grill. Linking grilling with a gas 
grill to braising or stewing is simply absurd. Stewing and braising involve 
meat's being partially or fully submerged in a liquid. This in no way compares 
to a higher humidity level in a gas grill vs a charcoal grill.<br>
<br>
 I have 
cooked on both gas and charcoal grills and can obtain the appropriate browning 
and degree of doneness on both.<br>
<br>
 I think most restaurants use a 
salamander to cook steaks. They can be either gas or electric.<br>
<br>
 You 
are correct about the importance of resting the cooked meat. It also helps a 
great deal to bring a steak to room temp before grilling.<br>
<br>
 Studies 
have shown that much of the &quot;charcoal&quot; flavor obtained from grilling 
is due to the vaporization of meat juices dripping onto hot coals/lava 
rocks/flavorizer bars. The resulting smoke flavors the meat. This effect would 
be available on gas and charcoal grills but not in a skillet or outdoor gas 
griddle. <br>

2008  Location: Fort Worth  Posts: 49 I wasn&#146;t trying to link Gas grilling 
to braising or stewing, I was trying to show that wet heat cooking was reserved 
for tougher meats that are generally braised or stewed. Also from what I 
understand it&#146;s not just a little moister that comes from gas grilling, 
it&#146;s a lot, almost 60% water vapor which steams the meat and makes it very 
difficult to achieve the Maillard effect. <br>
<br>
Look up the Maillard effect 
in Wiki, I couldn&#146;t add all the links that support the conclusion I came 
too. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the connection of the points is just a subjective 
opinion, but I do have a lot of verified information to back up the fact that 
there is a lot of water vapor in gas grilling and the effects and methods of 
searing to achieve the Maillard effect are well known and do in fact require 
Dry Heat to achieve properly according to all the expert opinions I&#146;ve 
read. I simply made the stretch (not much of one) that the wet heat from gas 
grilling would make it harder to achieve. In fact it is still hard to achieve 
properly on a charcoal grill with widely spaced grates as only a portion of the 
surface of the steak is in contact with the hot metal of the grill. It&#146;s 
my understanding that this is the reason most top chef&#146;s use a 
saut&eacute; pan on the oven top to sear their steaks as they have full contact 
to the meat surface plus the Fond is used for a sauce after deglazing which is 
far more effective then any flavorizing bars or meat juice vapor. <br>

28,404  I prefer to cook some cuts of steak in a hot skillet and finish it in 
the oven. This results in a beautiful sear from the stovetop and a gentle 
finish in the oven that yields a juicy interior.<br>
<br>
 I would not compare 
a grilled steak to one served with a pan sauce. They are not the same thing.

4,630  There is a huge difference between cooking over charchoal and the 
Maillard effect. Most importantly the flavor difference between the two.<br>

<br> I think those Wiki articles are looking too deep into the different 
methods of cooking. Any moisture that is developed from the burning of LP is 
irrelevant to grilling, IMHO.<br>
<br>
 If you can't get good carmelization 
(Maillard) on a gas grill, you need to change your approach or replace the unit 
you're cooking on.  __________________ <br>

I 
dont understand what you mean, I was talking about dry heat as the best method 
for acheiving the Maillard effect, thats all.<br>

I think it is 
difficult on any grill, especially a gas grill that gives off wet heat. Maybe 
you have never acheived this on any grill and have no reference unless you 
compare it to a steak done on a stove top and finished in the oven. Either that 
or you must get out the chemistry set and test the flavornoids before and after 
to see if the simple acids and molecules have broken down and formed new ones.
