 Barbecue Cooking Accessories <br>
<b>A look at 
must-have barbecuing accessories that can transform a simple cookout into a 
specialty feast</b> <br>

<p>By +Don Vandervort, HomeTips<br>
</p> 
<p>An array of accessories can transform a simple barbecue into a 
sophisticated outdoor kitchen.<br>
</p> 
<p>Rotisserie<br>
Designed to fit over the length of the grill, rotisseries 
are generally motor-driven, though manual types are also available. If you 
purchase a mechanical one, make sure the electrical cord can be placed safely 
out of the way. And check to see if your particular model of grill has a 
rotisserie accessory or a brand that makes rotisseries just for it.<br>
</p> 
<p>Beer poultry roaster<br>
Not just for beer but for any liquid such as wine 
or juice, a beer poultry roaster is a safe and secure device to lend moisture 
and flavor to a roasting chicken or other fowl. You just fill the base with the 
liquid of your choice, insert the infuser into the cavity of the bird, and 
place the infuser in the tray.</p> 
<p>Fish &amp; vegetable racks<br>
Perfect for any food that could fall between 
the grill and into the fire, theseracks offer the added benefit of being easily 
transportable from grill to table.<br>
</p> 
<p>Smoker attachment<br>
If you prefer the no-muss, no-fuss aspect of a gas 
grill but want the flavor that a charcoal grill imparts to food, a smoker is 
the solution. Just add barbecue wood chips for that smoky flavor.<br>
</p> 
<p>Standing racks<br>
These racks allow food to be cooked in an 
&ldquo;upright&rdquo; position, allowing you to cook more food at one time than 
you would otherwise be able to. There are even kabob kits with a rack that 
holds the skewers an even distance apart. As with fish and vegetable racks, 
these racks offer convenient transport.<br>
</p> 
<p>Griddle<br>
For the perfect outdoor brunch, set a griddle on top of the 
grill and you&rsquo;re set to make eggs, bacon, sausage, or anything else you 
normally would on your cooktop.<br>
</p> 
<p>Grill basket<br>
As an alternative to fish and vegetable racks, you can use 
a grill basket, which also comes in handy when grilling sandwiches. Look for 
one with a removable handle if you anticipate closing the grill's lid while 
cooking.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Thermometer<br>
To ensure your barbecue is cooked to perfection, use a meat 
thermometer. One model even comes with a remote. While you&rsquo;re in the 
kitchen preparing the rest of the meal, it will beep to let you know your food 
is done.<br>
</p> 
<p>Grill light<br>
If you live in a climate that allows for grilling 
year-round, invest in an adjustable grill light that attaches to the handle of 
almost any grill.<br>
</p> 
<p>Grill covers<br>
Choose a heavy-duty, form-fitting vinyl cover to protect 
your grill and prevent water from getting into the cabinets.</p> 
<p>Chimney starter<br>
The indispensable accessory for those who favor 
charcoal grills, a chimney starter will have your coals ready in 20 minutes. 
Simply place some newspaper at the bottom, fill the starter to the top with 
briquettes, and light the newspaper.<br>
</p> 
<p>The right tools<br>
The basic kit for barbecuing includes only long-handled 
tools to prevent burns from sudden flare-ups: spatula, tongs, fork, and basting 
brush. Never pierce meat when turning to prevent losing valuable juices. Use a 
stiff barbecue brush to clean the grill before every use.<br>
</p> 
<p>Grill hood<br>
Keep smoke away from the house with a ventilation hood made 
specifically for grills. Though it will endure damp conditions, it is a better 
idea to keep it covered with heavy-duty vinyl. <br>
</p> 
<p>Slide-out tank tray<br>
Retrieving the propane tank for refilling is an 
easier task if it rests on a slide-out tray.</p> Copyright &copy; 1997-2012,
