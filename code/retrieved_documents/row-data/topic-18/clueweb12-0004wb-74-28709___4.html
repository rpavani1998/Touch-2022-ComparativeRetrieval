 Smokers - What is a smoker? 
Why do you need a&nbsp;smoker? 
<p>Pork Butt with Smoke</p> Regarding BBQ Inc. <br>
 To understand what a 
smoker is, we need to first discuss what barbecue is. Barbecue is a loaded term 
that has many meanings, but when we are talking about smokers we are talking 
abouttrue barbecue. 
<p><b>What is Barbecue?</b> In this context, barbecue is a method of cooking 
tough cuts of meat (typically beef or pork) slowly over a low heat with smoke. 
This low and slow cooking process allows the tough connective tissues in these 
meats to breakdown, turning to sugar and water. At the same time, fats are 
slowly melted, providing moisture that prevents the meat from drying out. So 
what do we mean by low and slow? Smoking barbecue is done at temperatures 
between 225 F and 275 F (110 C to 135 C). Many purists will say that the lower 
the temperature the better the barbecue, but in recent years, many barbecue 
competitors have moved to higher temperatures, partly because the technology of 
modern smokers makes this possible. Since barbecue is cooked at such low 
temperatures, the cooking times are very long. Cooking times can be between 45 
minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes per pound. This means that a 10 pound beef 
brisket can easily take 10 hours to smoke. The smoke provides flavor, color, 
and aids in the breakdown of connective tissues (collagen) and fats.</p> 
<p><b>What is a Smoker?</b> In this context, a smoker is an outdoor cooking 
appliance that can maintain low cooking temperatures for extended periods of 
time while producing smoke and holding it around the meat for absorption. A 
good smoker does all this efficiently and provides the space necessary to 
produce the amount of barbecue needed.</p> 
<p><b>Can I Smoke on a Grill?</b> The simple answer is yes. The real answer is 
maybe. Gas grills are designed to pump heat through the cooking chamber. This 
is how they reach high temperatures; by brute force. Because of the high 
airflow in most gas grills, they are not good at capturing smoke and can cause 
foods to dry out over long periods of time. Gas grills do not make good 
smokers. Charcoal grills, on the other hand, can make good smokers. Charcoal 
grills burn charcoal, produce smoke, and if they have a lid and a good design, 
can hold low temperatures for long periods of time. The trick tosmoking on a 
charcoal grill is to have a grill large enough to place the meat away from the 
direct heat of the charcoal fire. This is done either by cooking indirectly or 
by using some kind of baffle (more on this later). The limits of charcoal grill 
smoking, is the size. Most charcoal grills are too small to produce a lot of 
barbecue, so if you want to smoke more than two racks of ribs or a pork roast, 
then you will need something larger, or in other words; a smoker.</p> 
<p><b>Which Smoker is Right for Me?</b> There are many ways to smoke low and 
slow and there are many kinds of smokers and smoker/grills on the market. In 
the following pages I explore all the different kinds of smokers in detail, but 
for now lets just say that you can buy wood smokers, charcoal smokers, gas 
smokers, electric smokers, and pellet smokers. Each has its advantages and 
disadvantages, but the most important factor is you, what kind of barbecue you 
want to smoke, and how much effort (and money) you want to put into it. </p>
