 So you want to purchase a new grill? 
You go to some local store with half a dozen models to choose from and you get 
confused. How manyBTU's do you need? What size should you get? Who makes a 
reliable and easy to use grill? Do you wantcharcoal or gas? There are hundreds 
of questions you can ask, so I am going to try and help you out.
<p>You can select from electric grills, charcoal grills, gas grills, Portable 
Grills and pellet grills (burns wood pellets). Generally, electric grills are 
the easiest to use but you won't get a real fire flavor. Gas is easy and 
convenient, has better than electric grills but not as good as charcoal or 
pellet grills. Pellet grills are easy to use and have great flavor but tend to 
be more expensive and are not available in most retail outlets. Charcoal grills 
are readily available, inexpensive, and can produce great food but you will be 
lighting charcoal and dealing with all that involves. The real question you 
have to ask yourself is do you want the occasional big cookout where you have 
the time for charcoal, or do you want to be able to fire up the grill and be 
eating in 30 minutes.</p> 
<p>Unless you have money to burn, the price of a grill is an important factor. 
Gas Grills can range from $100USD to $10,000USD. Charcoal grills can be had for 
under $50USD or more than $2,000USD. Propane is cheaper than charcoal so your 
fuel cost is much less so you can actually save money in the long run if you 
cook out a lot. Pellets can be expensive and difficult to find in many places, 
but the flavor is superior because it is a pure hardwood fire. Electric just 
needs to be plugged in, but can't be used if the power is out. Remember that a 
grill can be a backup cooking appliance in an emergency.</p> 
<p>You can spend a lot of money on a grill. My advice to you is not to get 
sucked in by flashy features. These days grills can come with built in 
refrigerators and gas powered ovens in addition to the usual side burners, 
infrared burners, rotisserie burners and sear burners. These add to not only to 
the price of a grill, but to the complexity and the chance of breakdowns. Keep 
your grill choice as small and a simple as you need. In other words, if you 
don't really need it, don't buy it. Of course you should think about those 
extras that you might need. Suppose you need to boil a pot of water and your 
power is out. Unless you have a gas stove indoors you might need a side burner 
outdoors. Grills, particularly gas grills, can come in very handy in an 
emergency.</p>
