<h5><b>GAS GRILLING FOR BEGINNERS</b> </h5> 
<h5>&nbsp;</h5> 
<p>We suggest each beginner get the grilling aspects down pat before 
proceeding to barbecuing.</p> 
<p> We separate gas grilling from charcoal because, really, they are two 
different animals. Gas, unlike charcoal and wood derives its source from 
propane, butane or natural gas. For the purposes of this presentation, we will 
treat all as simply &quot;Gas&quot;.</p> 
<p> all right now, let's address the people who like to &quot;light and 
run&quot;. Not only do you want to eat quickly by grilling, but you are also in 
a hurry and don't want to waste any time waiting for the coals to get ready. In 
contrast to the Charcoal grill, a gas grill offers convenience above everything 
else. Simply turn on the gas near the bottle, raise the lid, turn on the gas 
valve on the grill and light the match! There, you have received the complete 
course. BUT, of course, there is more to turning out great food than that.</p> 
<p>As we move along our journey to getting started using a gas grill, you will 
notice that we never refer to cooking barbecue on a gas grill. The reason is 
that to cook barbecue, one needs to use charcoal/wood coals cooking over long 
periods of time (6 to 12 or more hours) in dry heat. Obviously, gas grills will 
not work in this manner.</p> 
<p>Since you people are in such a hurry, we shall move on along . In this 
section, we will be discussing the following points:</p> 
<p>Choices of gas grills, Basic features, Lighting the grill, Getting started, 
Methods of cooking various meats, Cleaning the grill.</p> 
<p> And there are many types of gas grills which to choose from. For the most 
part, there are only two basic styles. First, forget the fancy options. 
Beginners should concentrate on performance over convenience. We say that, 
because we are simply sticking to the basics here. The primary choices should 
centre around Size, Construction and Performance.</p> 
<p><b>Size:</b> Choose a grill which is large enough to cook for a relatively 
nice size party. Once you get the hang of outdoor cooking, you are going to 
want to invite your friends, and heaven forbid, your relatives over for some 
great food. So choose a grill that will handle the action. If you choose a 
grill that is convenient just for you and your significant other, then what are 
you going to do when I come over and want to eat too? Besides, a gas grill is 
always capable of cooking smaller quantities just nicely.</p> 
<p><b>Construction:</b> Gas Grills come in many different sizes and shapes. 
Additionally, they come in several different types of materials. Stainless 
Steel, Solid Steel and Cast Aluminium. We choose not to discuss the ones 
constructed out of sheet metal, unless price is more important that longevity.
</p> 
<p>Our first choice is split between stainless steel and cast aluminium. Both 
of these materials resist rust, corrosion and general deterioration. Both will 
offer you long life and superior performance. You be the judge.</p> 
<p><b>Performance:</b> This is sort of a &quot;catch all&quot; category. Look 
for a grill offering at least dual (2) separate burners. We'll talk about that 
a little later in our &quot;Techniques&quot; area. Make sure you get a grill 
capable of generating at least 35,000 Btu's. If you cannot generate enough 
heat, you will be sorely disappointed in the performance. It is easier to get 
the head down instead of simply wishing that you could increase the heat. Also, 
we recommend portability. This offers the ability to move in under the shed 
from the weather, be it pouring rain or blistering heat. Lava rocks, flavoured 
briquettes, metal deflectors, basically they all serve the same purpose, some 
better than others. One, they prevent fat from the meat reaching the flames 
which in turn create infernos inside you pit, and two, the offer a radiating of 
heat which helps cook more evenly. The best idea we have seen are thick full 
deflecting shields which cover the entire flame (not just a portion which can 
find the flame) and are thick enough to radiate some good even heat.</p> 
<p>The rest is window dressing and depending upon the depth of your pocket, 
are or are not necessary. When I am asked &quot;Do I need a window in my gas 
grill?&quot;, I reply &quot;The meet doesn't need to see out and with all the 
smoke, you can't see in!&quot;. You be the judge on accessories.</p> 
<p> Remember you are just beginning you don't need anything real fancy. So, 
don't go out and blow a bundle. Start with something simple. Prices will vary 
from &pound;150.00 to &pound;800.00 and more. I believe a good quality grill 
can be purchased for &pound;150.00 to &pound;200.00 that will last 10 to 15 
years with proper maintenance and care. Good luck!</p> 
<p> <b>FIRST, ALWAYS KEEP THE LID RAISED WHEN LIGHTING THE GRILL! AND FOLLOW 
THE INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR USER'S MANUAL</b>. The reason we want the grill lid to 
remain open is due to the simple fact that if there is a ton of gas in an 
enclosed chamber and you place a match in it, the we have to go find another 
reader. 'Cause you aren't going to be around here any more. Hint: If it is real 
windy, have someone hold up a shield of some kind or move the grill to an area 
where it is less windy to keep the wind from blowing out the flame or match. Do 
not light or use in an enclosed area!</p> 
<p>Simply put, 1) raise the lid of your gas grill. 2) Turn on the gas at the 
propane bottle. 3) Turn on one of the gas burners on the grill. 4) Press the 
auto light button if your grill has one. If there are holes in the bottom of 
your unit, then you can stick a match near the burner from that position. If 
not, then use a long match from the top. If that is not available, throw a 
match in near the burners. Once the burner has been lit, then turn on the other 
one or two burners. Allow the entire grill to burn for about 5 to 10 minutes on 
high. This will burn off any remaining food and grease accumulations on the 
diffusers below. Once the smoke subsides and it appears to be burning smoother 
and cleaner, then you can turn the burners back down to low and get ready to do 
some cooking!<b>REMEMBER, ALWAYS KEEP THE LID RAISED WHEN LIGHTING THE GRILL!
</b></p> 
<p>Now that we have our gas grill selected and lit, we are ready to begin the 
process of outdoor cooking. Get ready to fend off the neighbours when the food 
begins sizzling and smelling up the neighbourhood!</p> 
<p>Plan your meals - decide at least several hours ahead of time what the menu 
will consist of. Meat, veggies, appetisers and dessert. Do the shopping early 
and have each item planned and set out for easy access. Season the meat and 
allow it to sit for at least an hour before cooking begins. Beverages are an 
important part of any cookout . . . so make sure the favourites are within 
reach at all times.</p> 
<p>&quot;What&quot; is to be cooked is not nearly as important as is 
&quot;how&quot; it is cooked. A juicy hamburger is better any day than a 
char-dead steak! So, our objective, as well as our intent, is to teach each 
person to cook anything and everything. We will let you determine which recipes 
seem appealing and we'll show you how to cook it!</p> 
<p>The actual cooking on a gas grill is not that much different than with a 
charcoal grill with one exception. A gas grill has the tendency to get too hot. 
To alleviate the problem, you can try two alternatives. First, since many 
grills will not allow you to turn down the flame any lower, try to turn down 
the amount of gas on the propane tank itself. You should be able to get it 
quite low. If this doesn't work, then take a piece of wood or metal and place 
it between the lid's top and bottom thus forcing the lid to stay open and let 
some of the excess heat out.</p> 
<p> Many want to know &quot;Do I cook with the lid open or closed?&quot;. Well 
the answer depends upon what you are cooking. For the most part, when the lid 
is closed, then you are going to be cooking a little faster than with the lid 
open. A closed lid retains the heat and thus allows higher temperatures to 
accumulate. If the meat it thicker, like a brisket whole chicken or even a pork 
shoulder, then the best way would be with the lid closed. (Remember to hold the 
lid open if necessary to adjust the heat levels.</p> 
<p>Our experience indicates that most users of gas grills have a tendency to 
have the lid closed when cooking. Well, we're not sure that is the best way to 
grill foods. For example, how many times have you been to a outdoor fair or 
even a restaurant and seen the lid closed? Some, I'm sure. But the great 
majority have the lid open and they simply stand there turning the meat as it 
cooks and letting both sides experience the flame. Except with the possibility 
of delicate meats such as fish, we recommend keeping the lid open. This allows 
the meat to be grilled on each side the exact amount of time you desire and 
will keep the meat from being cooked too fast with temperatures that are too 
hot.</p> 
<p>In between size of meats, such as whole turkey breasts and chicken 
quarters, then perhaps try it both ways and see what works best for you. 
Remember, you are grilling with hotter temperatures and not barbecuing. 
Therefore care needs to be taken to prevent over cooking and cooking too 
rapidly, therefore our recommendation for mostly open lid cooking.</p> 
<p>The required temperature of the grill will vary depending upon the 
selection of food. Use the &quot;Hand&quot; method discussed above in Lesson 
Number 3 - if a thermometer is not available. For example, fish will need a 
medium fire 200C to 210C while a steak will need a hot fire 375C+. Here are 
some rough ideas for your use:</p> 
<p><b>Fish</b>: Use a medium fire. Fish should be close to room temperature 
before cooking. Coat the fish with a light coating of oil and turn often. 
Remember, fish cooks easily and quickly. To determine when fish is done, use a 
fork and attempt to break it apart in the thickest portion. It should flake 
easily. If not, then cook on.</p> 
<p><b>Chicken Pieces:</b> Use a medium/hot fire. Chicken should be close to 
room temperature before cooking. Place the seasoned chicken on the grill and 
allow to brown on the first side and then the other. If the fire is hot enough, 
the chicken will seize the cooking grate at first and then release when it is 
ready to turn. Chicken will be done once it reaches 75C. Use the bi-therm 
instant thermometer to verify it is done.</p> 
<p><b>Pork Chops</b>: Use a medium/hot fire. Pork and Lamb Chops should be 
close to room temperature or a little cooler before cooking. Cook similar to 
chicken. Pork is done when the internal temperature reaches 65C. There may be 
some pinkness, but all undesirable are killed at 60C. Do not cook over 70C. as 
you will then guarantee a dry, tough piece of meat.</p> 
<p><b>Steaks:</b> Use a hot fire! The temperature of a steak before cooking 
may vary somewhat. Our preference is to select a smaller diameter yet thicker 
(at least 20mm) piece of meat. This allows for proper charring of the outside 
of the meat, but still retain a juicy interior. These are the type of steaks 
seen in favourite steak houses. If for some reason a thinner steak is being 
used (12mm), cool the steak down to where it is firm, but not frozen solid. 
This will provide for charring on the outside while the inside is spending most 
of the time just thawing. The result will be a charred outside and juicy 
inside! For more information on cooking the perfect steak, please see &quot;A 
Steak on Every Grill&quot;.</p> 
<p> Always use the bi-therm instant read thermometer to determine when the 
meat has reached the desired doneness.</p> 
<p><b>CLEANING THE GRILL</b></p> 
<p>To clean a gas grill, simply turn the burners on high and allow them to 
burn the excess grease and food from the grates. Usually if turned on high, the 
burners will remove most particles in 5 to 10 minutes. You can then take a wire 
brush and brush the steel grates so that they are clean. On the ceramic grates, 
follow manufactures' recommendations. If you do not have such recommendations, 
then use a damp cloth and wipe them down clean.</p> 
<p>As for the grates, again let the grill cool. There are two ways to do this. 
First, simply take a steel wire brush and vigorously brush/scrape all of the 
cooked on food off the surface. Then use a paper towel to remove any loose 
material. Secondly, before you begin to cook the next time, heat the grill to 
high temperature to cook the food off. You can then simply brush the food off 
easily. We hope the forgoing sets each person on the correct path to creating 
great outdoor events. Don't forget to enjoy the process, have fun and if things 
don't turnout just right, consider it a learning experience and keep on trying. 
Getting there is most of the fun!</p>
