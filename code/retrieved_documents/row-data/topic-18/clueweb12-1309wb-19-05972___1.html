Answer: It's all about flavor! <br>
&nbsp; <br>
In the last several 
years a &quot;zillion&quot; gas grills have been purchased. Supposedly gas is 
more convenient; until you clean the grill or realize the maintenance on 
burners, orifices, gas lines etc. No salesperson for gas grills is ever going 
to mention those &quot;convenience&quot; features.<br>
<br>
 With barbecook 
grills there is nothing to service. They work every time! Barbecook grills are 
the easiest and safest charcoal grills you will ever use because ofQuickStart
&nbsp;and&nbsp; QuickStop. The more expensive the gas grill the more gimmicks 
they have added to try to incorporate the flavor of charcoal. WHY?? Ask any 
honest grill dealer, they will all say&nbsp; &quot;Charcoal tastes better!&quot;
<br> <br>
FLAVOR&nbsp; is the issue! Charcoal briquets contain a lot of fillers 
and chemicals and we simply do not recommend them.&nbsp; Natural lump charcoal
&nbsp;comes in many varieties and brands. Once you use it you'll never want a 
briquet. Natural lump charcoal is just wood, no additives. It gives flavor 
without chemical tastes. It also lights faster and gets hotter; the real secret 
in locking in juices and flavor. Besides natural lump charcoal, you can also 
use just plain wood; like you use in your fireplace or wood stove. Every wood 
imparts its own characteristic flavor.&nbsp; EXPERIMENT. Last night I read an 
article about charcoal grilling fishes on wood planks. The article talked of 
using alder, cedar and cherry planks. This for me brings up another issue:&nbsp;

</i></b><i> &quot;Gas versus Charcoal&quot; ... there 
is a difference and it's FLAVOR!</i><b><i> </i></b>What was once a matter of 
opinion is not anymore. In an article by Lisa Mayer in Hearth &amp; Home 
magazine the facts came out. &quot;After analyzing meat cooked over charcoal 
and gas, Dr. E.E. Litkenhous of Vanderbilt university determined that there is 
a real scietific difference in the chemical reaction that occurs during the two 
cooking methods.&quot;<br>
<br>
 According to Dr. Litkenhous, when charcoal is 
burned it produces virtually moisture free, super-heated air accompanied by 
intense radiant heat, which &quot;case hardens&quot; the meat's surface, 
sealing in the juices. The wood volatiles (wood gases remaining in charcoal 
after carbonization takes place) that are released when charcoal is burned 
coagulate the meat's surface proteins. The result is charcoal-smoke FLAVOR and 
meat that takes on a &quot;plumped&quot; characteristic. Since gas is nearly 
30% moisture, it tends to &quot;steam distill&quot; meat, according to 
Litkenhous. The meat loses more juices and takes on a &quot;floppy&quot; 
characteristic.<br>

 Cook's Illustrated magazine performed its own 
comparison tests for its August 2004 issue. Testers found that &quot;grilling 
over charcoal provides exceptional browning and searing that a gas grill simply 
can't replicate. That's because a charcoal fire, built with plenty of charcoal, 
gets hotter than a gas fire. Besides searing, charcoal adds another distinct 
advantage - SMOKE FLAVOR!<br>
<br>
 Paul Fine commented &quot;Look at barbecue 
cook-offs and contests where flavor really counts. NONE of those competitors 
use gas.&quot; <br>
