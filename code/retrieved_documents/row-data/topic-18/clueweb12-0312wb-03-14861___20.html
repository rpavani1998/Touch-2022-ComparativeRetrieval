 Chemicals in foods and their side effects
<br> <br>

<h2>Chemicals found in commercial foods&nbsp;and their harmful effects</h2> 
<p>More and more we are finding that the foods we are eating are at the root 
ofmany serious health problems. For the past 45 years an array of unnatural 
andsynthetic foods have been put into the foods we buy. Learn to read labelsand 
be aware of the effects of chemicals found in common commercial foods.</p> 
<p><em>The following information is taken from the Food Bible - by 
Benkendorf.See our web page for availability and for further information in the 
book onother chemicals in foods and their damaging affects on the system, 
alsodetailed lists of name brand foods that do and do not no contain 
thesechemicals.</em></p> 
<p><strong>ALGINATES</strong> (ammonium, calcium, potassium and sodium; 
propylene glycolalginate; algin derivatives). Used to stabilize and promote a 
creamytexture. Found in ice cream, salad dressings, cheese spreads, 
frozendinners, ramen soups and others. FDA is performing tests for childbirth 
andreproductive problems.</p> 
<p><strong>ALUMINUM</strong> is added to many foods, in beer, soda pop cans, 
packaging for manyproducts. It tends to accumulate in our bodies over the years 
and found todestroy brain cells. Strongly suspected as a cause of Alzheimers</p>
<p><strong>ARTIFICIAL COLORS</strong> (made of coal tar based dyes).Used to 
improve theappearance of inferior products to look wholesome and fresh, to use 
in placeof natural colors which turn pale or brown with time, to attract 
children tothe bright colors. Used in drink mixes, puddings, cereals, candy, 
gelatindesserts, ice cream etc. Concern that they cause malignancy, 
toxicity,allergic reactions, hyperactivity in children and much more.</p> 
<p><strong>ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS</strong> ( over 1,500 including benzaldehyde and 
methylsalicylatres). Used to add flavor food when natural flavor are 
removedthrough processing. Not life threatening but have been associated 
withdepression and reduced sexual urges and reproductive problems. A 
definitelink to hyperactivity in children.</p> 
<p><strong>BHA &amp; BHT</strong> (butylated hydroxyanisole and 
hydroxytoluene) Used to keep foodsfrom changing color and fats from becoming 
rancid. Included in cereals,baked goods, drink mixes, instant potato flakes, 
boxed dinners, chewing gumand others. Both can cause allergic reactions, affect 
the nervous system andprecipitates behavioral problems in children.</p> 
<p><strong>BROMATE</strong> (calcium and potassium bromate). Dough 
conditioners that can affectthe function of the kidneys as well as the nervous 
system. Can be very toxicif dosage becomes too high. Found in bread, baked 
goods, packaged breadcrumbs, refrigerated biscuits and others.</p> 
<p><strong>COTTONSEED OIL</strong> (arsenic is used to defoliate the cotton) 
The risk ofpossible dangerous chemical residues is too great to recommend any 
foods inwhich the oil is used. Found in crackers, soups, salad dressings, 
cookies,baking mixes, potato chips etc.</p> 
<p><strong>EDTA</strong> (ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid). It binds with 
the metal particlesin foods, brought about by food processing and removes them 
from the body.It also removes other metals vital to our health, like iron, zinc 
etc.Because of this it is very important for pregnant and nursing women to 
avoidfoods with EDTA. It can also cause toxicity and kidney damage. Contained 
inmargarine, salad dressings, canned legumes, boxed dinners, frozen dinnersand 
others.</p> 
<p><strong>MSG</strong> (monosodium glutamate) A flavor enhancer which will 
greatly increase theflavors of certain highly processed foods. For possible 
cancer-causing,reproduction and fertility, and possible brain-altering effects. 
Found inChinese food,seasoned salts, soups , bouillon, frozen dinners, 
saladdressing mixes, boxed dinners etc.</p> 
<p><strong>NITRATAES &amp; NITRITES</strong> (is a preservative) Nitrites 
combine with stomachjuices to form powerful cancer-causing agents called 
nitrosamines. Used incured meats, giving a particular taste and color to bacon, 
bologna, salami,frankfurter, ham, pepperoni etc.</p> 
<p><strong>NUTRASWEET</strong> (aspartame) Shown that children could suffer 
brain damage from ahigh intake of aspartame. Doctors advise women to not use 
during pregnancyor when breast feeding. Also, can produce headaches, dizziness, 
behavioralchanges, mood swings, seizures and urinary tract infections. Found 
ingelatin desserts, soft drinks, beverage mixes, hot cocoa mixes, 
desserts,yogurt and more.</p> 
<p><strong>SULFITES</strong> are preservatives and antioxidants that can be 
very dangerous forsome people. Symptoms may include headaches, facial and head 
flushing,abdominal pains and faintness and can occur together and singly, 
15-30minutes after eating. The FDA has confirmed 17 deaths due to 
sulfites.Although banned on fresh fruits and vegetables it has been reported to 
stillbe in use, and in some cases, minute amounts can be used on foods 
withoutlabeling. It is suggested that the outside leaves of lettuce etc. 
bedestroyed. You many want to ask if sulfates have been used.</p> Add new

<b>
9.&nbsp;Honey<br>
</b>Honey is a natural antiseptic, makes a good salve for 
burns and wounds, assimilates rapidly&nbsp;<br>
and easily, not irritating to 
the digestive tract. Promotes&nbsp;energy and healing,&nbsp;helps one to<br>

recuperate rapidly from severe exertion, has a natural and gently laxative 
effect, helps in&nbsp;<br>
hypertension. For sinus problems, hayfever, kills 
bacteria, has anti- hemorrhage value. An<br>
excellent natural sweetener.<br>

<b>10.&nbsp;Water</b><br>
Necessary for the smooth operation of a variety of 
bodily functions, regulates body temperature,&nbsp;<br>
assists in removing 
waste materials through the colon, helps carry nutrients and oxygen to the&nbsp;
<br>cells, moistens the oxygen in the lungs. It helps the body absorb 
nutrients, and to covert food<br>
into energy, protects and cushions vital 
organs, like the liver and kidneys. Water cushions your&nbsp;<br>
joints, which 
prevents creaking, it helps help lower cholesterol, reduces high blood pressure 
and<br>
eliminates free radicals. It also helps prevent the development of 
stomach ulcers, and improves<br>
brain function.</p> 
<h3><b>APPLE CIDER VINEGAR</b></h3> 
<p>Apple cider vinegar is high in potassium and more effective than any other 
source,&nbsp;<br>
because it has the minerals and the acid medium in which 
potassium needs to work.&nbsp;<br>
Potassium prevents high blood pressure, 
unwanted fluid retention, regulates the body's<br>
water balance, normalizes 
the heart rhythm and works inside cells to keep sodium in<br>
check. Other 
foods high in potassium are bananas, potatoes, grapefruit.</p> 
<p>Good digestion means health. By taking 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar 
to a glass<br>
of water at each meal, it can be helpful in maintaining the 
health of your digestive tract,&nbsp;<br>
and in turn the all-around health of 
you body. It destroys microorganism, including&nbsp;<br>
bacteria, fungi, 
viruses and others. It prevents poisons from reaching the rest of your&nbsp;<br>
system, especially effective for Food Poisoning. It combats inflammation of the 
kidneys&nbsp;<br>
and the bladder. Since the vinegar will be helping you burn 
fat instead of store it, your<br>
daily activities will help you shed inches 
much more quickly than pounds.</p> 
<p>To cope with chronic fatigue, mix 3 teaspoons vinegar to 1 cup of honey and 
take&nbsp;<br>
2 teaspoons of this mixture before going to bed. If you are not 
asleep within a 1/2 hour,<br>
take 2 more teaspoonful and another at any time 
you wake up and unable to fall back&nbsp;<br>
asleep. Another way to overcome 
fatigue is to use apple cider vinegar in your bath<br>
(1/2 pint to a tub full 
of water) and soak for 15 minutes. For a refreshing pick-up add&nbsp;<br>

several oz. to a sink full of water and splash this on you shoulders, arms, 
armpits, on&nbsp;<br>
your chest, stomach, neck and face. Do not dry, but let 
it soak in.</p> 
<p>For migraines, tension or other types of headaches, apple cider vinegar is 
worth a try&nbsp;<br>
by drinking it, putting it in a vaporizer or taking it in 
water a.m. and p.m. and at every<br>
meal. If headaches persist, try doubling 
the amount of vinegar, also try 2 tsp. of honey&nbsp;<br>
at each meal. If you 
already have a headache take 1 tablespoon of honey at once, and<br>
later, if 
needed.&nbsp;An apple cider vinegar gargle brings marked relief to sore 
throats.&nbsp;Set<br>
2-4 tablespoons of vinegar in open dishes for an air 
freshener.</p> 
<p>Apple cider vinegar, taken on a daily basis, can bring you arthritis relief 
by helping to&nbsp;<br>
dissolve calcium deposits in joints and whisking them 
away for excretion. You may&nbsp;<br>
need to take 2 T in 1/1/2 cup water and 
repeat this 3-5 times a day, along with lemon&nbsp;<br>
and lime juice or apple 
and grape juice fasts.</p> 
<p>It can help you fight off infections, reduces heart attacks by keeping the 
blood vessels&nbsp;<br>
soft and pliable, mental activity is more effective 
because more oxygen reaches the brain.</p> 
<p>Use a mild apple cider vinegar douche (4 tsp. vinegar to 1 pint water) to 
support the<br>
health of the vaginal intestinal flora. This discourages 
candida growth.</p> 
<p>A tonic made with 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, and 1 teaspoon honey to 1 
cup hot&nbsp;<br>
water can help with dry skin, to increase hormone levels, to 
ease insomnia and burn off<br>
unwanted pounds! Nutritionists have used apple 
cider vinegar to treat Alzheimer's and&nbsp;<br>
senility, age-related diseases 
often triggered by mineral deficiencies.</p> 
<p><br>
Apply the vinegar directly to insect stings for quick relief or to 
cool sunburns by adding&nbsp;<br>
a few cups of vinegar to your bath. Frequent 
nosebleeds can be stopped by soaking a&nbsp;<br>
cotton ball in the vinegar and 
packing it lightly into the nostrils. Gargling with a mouthwash<br>
mix of salt 
and vinegar can soothe sore throats and toothaches.</p> 
<p>Both apple cider vinegar and garlic are powerful antioxidants. They zap the 
free radicals&nbsp;<br>
that cause aging and contribute to tumor growth.</p> 
<h3><b>CAYENNE</b></h3> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b></p> 
<p>It can be used in powder form or in a tincture. It is one of the most 
widely used medicinal&nbsp;<br>
herbs. A list of its uses could fill a small 
book. To increase circulation to the scalp for<br>
baldness take 3 cayenne caps 
twice a day with meals. Use often when you have a cold<br>
or any sinus 
problems, or hay fever because it reduces immune reactivity, dries up 
mucus,&nbsp;<br>
opens nasal passages and helps the immune system. A teaspoon 
of the cayenne tincture&nbsp;<br>
added to a cup of warm water makes a great 
gargle for sore throats and mucus congestion.</p> 
<p>Sprinkle a pinch of cayenne powder on a cut to quickly stop the bleeding. 
Its antibacterial<br>
properties help prevent infections. It can invigorate the 
blood , remove toxins in the body&nbsp;<br>
and improve circulation. You can 
make a paste by mixing a teaspoon of cayenne into a&nbsp;<br>
tablespoon of 
olive oil to rub on cold sores, sore joints or sore muscles.</p> 
<p>You can make cayenne oil by soaking 1/2cup of cayenne powder in 1 cup of 
oil for 10 days.&nbsp;<br>
Strain the oil and bottle it for use. Rub the oil 
onto sore muscles and joints to increase<br>
circulation and to reduce pain.</p>
<p>It can heal eye problems, but it will burn for a few minutes. If you have a 
burning sensation<br>
in your stomach after taking a strong dose, don't worry 
this is normal. You could reduce the<br>
dose next time; however, you do get 
used to it.</p> 
<h3><b>CHARCOAL</b></h3> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>Charcoal has been used effectively in the healing arts for 
centuries, and is considered&nbsp;<br>
the most valuable single agent currently 
available for treating poisonings, internally and&nbsp;<br>
externally. Doctors 
still use it today as a healing agent and antidote for poisons and an&nbsp;<br>

effective treatment for indigestion and gas, deodorizing foul-smelling gas or 
stools. It is&nbsp;<br>
used in water purification, air purification and for 
removing undesirable odors and impurities&nbsp;<br>
in food. Activated charcoal 
is required by law to be part of the standard equipment on&nbsp;<br>
many 
ambulances, for use in poisonings. Charcoal placed in gas masks during 
World&nbsp;<br>
War 1 counteracted the effects of chemical warfare. Mushroom 
poisoning, brown recluse<br>
spider bites, and snake bites can all be treated 
with activated charcoal. Doctors also use&nbsp;<br>
charcoal to prevent and 
treat intestinal infections, and as a cleansing and healing agent.&nbsp;<br>

Jaundice of the newborn, bee stings, poison ivy reactions, and many other 
illness can be&nbsp;<br>
helped with activated charcoal.</p> 
<p>The best and most effective charcoal is activated charcoal. This activation 
process&nbsp;<br>
renders it 2-3 times as effective as regular charcoal, the 
activation being accomplished<br>
by fine grinding and processing by steam. 
Charcoal from burn toast is considered worth-<br>
less, and charcoal briquettes 
dangerous due to the added petrochemicals. Activated<br>
charcoal powder is 
easily taken orally by placing a spoonful in a glass, adding water,&nbsp;<br>

juice etc., stirring it and drinking it. Charcoal is odorless and tasteless, 
although the&nbsp;<br>
texture is strange. It does come in capsules. Powdered 
activated charcoal reaches its&nbsp;<br>
maximal rate of adsorption extremely 
rapidly, within 1 minute after ingestion.</p> 
<p>To make a poultice for infections, secretions, bacteria, toxins, insect 
stings, even snake&nbsp;<br>
bites, as well as to relieve pain, place a 
charcoal paste between 2 pieces of paper toweling<br>
or porous cloth, making 
it the size to your need. The paste is made by mixing equal parts&nbsp;<br>
of 
flaxseed meal or corn starch with the charcoal powder in a bowl. Add hot, to 
boiling water&nbsp;<br>
to make a moderately thick paste, but thin enough to 
spread on the toweling. Place over the&nbsp;<br>
area to be treated and cover 
with a piece of household plastic. Now use a cloth or wool&nbsp;<br>
material 
to cover and hold the poultice and plastic in place. Secure with a tie, a 
stretch&nbsp;<br>
bandage or pin. Apple 1-2 hours or if at bed time, leave 
overnight. Adsorption takes place&nbsp;<br>
almost immediately. Change poultice 
after each use. Wash and cleanse area with cool&nbsp;<br>
water. Repeat as 
needed.</p> 
<p>Among the many substances known to be adsorbed to the surface of charcoal 
are poisons<br>
(such as lead acetate, DDT, strychnine), drugs (including 
aspirin, cocaine, iodine,<br>
phenobarbital, penicillin), and inorganic 
substances (among them mercury, chlorin, lead).</p> 
<p>A study made in 1981 shows that activated charcoal cuts down on the amount 
of gas&nbsp;<br>
produced by beans and other gas-producing foods. It adsorbs 
the excess gas as well as<br>
the bacteria that form the gas. It is helpful in 
relieving nervous diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea,&nbsp;<br>
spastic colon, 
indigestion and peptic ulcers. For such problems take between 1 teaspoon<br>

and 1 1/2 tablespoons of powdered charcoal up to 3 times a day. Take it between 
meals,&nbsp;<br>
as food can reduce its effectiveness.</p> 
<p>To whiten your teeth, dip wet toothbrush in charcoal and brush. The 
charcoal can be mixed<br>
with soda or another powder for flavor.</p> 
<p>For food poisoning, take 1 tablespoon with water, 3 times a day, between 
meals. Taking&nbsp;<br>
bentonite with it is even more effective, but much more 
water would need to be taken, and&nbsp;<br>
if there is cramping or the person 
is already throwing up, this would not be wise. Taken<br>
with milk thistle, it 
can restore and help the liver.</p> 
<p><b>Herbs often can help people deal with chronic health conditions that 
conventional&nbsp;<br>
medicine find perplexing. For example, &quot;studies 
strongly suggest that milk thistle can<br>
protect the liver from injury. There 
is no pill or tablet your doctor can prescribe to do<br>
the same.&quot; (from 
Natural Health Bible by Bratman, MD &amp; Kroll PhD).</b></p> 
<p><i><b>CAUTION:</b></i> charcoal may adsorb and inactivate other 
medications. If you are taking colloidal<br>
silver it can take that out too 
You can usually take charcoal 2 hours before or after other drugs.&nbsp;<br>
If 
you are taking prescription drugs, check with your doctor before beginning 
treatment with&nbsp;<br>
charcoal. You can take charcoal intermittently for 
long periods or regularly for up to 23 weeks.<br>
However, do not take it 
regularly for long periods.</p> 
<p><b>Home Use of Activated Charcoal Rising </b>( a write up in the local 
newspaper Dec. 7, 2002)<b><br>
</b>CHICAGO (AP) - Activated charcoal, a poison 
antidote used in emergency rooms for decades,<br>
can be easily used in 
children at home and may help prevent a trip to the hospital, a study<br>

found. The substance is a fine powder form of . Processed charcoal that binds 
to many types<br>
of poisons and can keep them from being absorbed into the 
bloodstream. Stocked by some&nbsp;<br>
pharmacies, it can be mixed at home with 
water, juice or soft drinks, and also comes pre-<br>
mixed with water. While 
American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines still recommend that&nbsp;<br>

parents of young children keep a bottle of ipecac syrup on hand for accidental 
poisonings,&nbsp;<br>
many local poison control centers have started 
recommending home use of activated charcoal&nbsp;<br>
as well. Ipecac works for 
substances such as toxic plants or vitamin overdoses, while charcoal&nbsp;<br>

is considered more effective for a broad range of household items including 
certain cough&nbsp;<br>
medicines, painkillers and disinfectant cleaners.</p> 
<p>Home use of activated charcoal has been limited because many parents don't 
know about it&nbsp;<br>
or are uncertain how to administer it, Kentucky 
researchers report in December's issue of<br>
Pediatrics. Their study of 
accidental poisonings in Kentucky found that parents could&nbsp;<br>

successfully use activated charcoal at home. In 115 out of 138 cases for which 
the substance<br>
was recommended and instructions on use were given, children 
were able to be treated at&nbsp;<br>
home with no complications. The 23 cases 
treated in emergency rooms involved children&nbsp;<br>
whose parents didn't 
have activated charcoal at home and whose local pharmacies didn't<br>
stock it.
</p> 
<p>In 30 of the cases treated at home, care givers reported some difficulty 
using activated<br>
charcoal, but all ultimately administered it successfully, 
the researchers said. In many&nbsp;<br>
of the home cases, children received 
the substance within an hour of ingesting poison,&nbsp;<br>
which is optimal 
for reducing poison absorption, said authors Henry Spiller of Kentucky's&nbsp;
<br>Regional Poison Center in Louisville and Dr. George Rodgers of the 
University of Louisville.<br>
It's also a lot quicker than the time it would 
have taken to get them emergency room&nbsp;<br>
treatment, they said. 
&quot;Greater efforts need to be put into educating parents about the&nbsp;<br>

need to stock activated charcoal in the home in advance of a poisoning,&quot; 
they said.<br>
Pharmacists and pediatricians, too, should be made aware that 
the substance can be&nbsp;<br>
effectively used at home, they said.</p> 
<h3><b>COLLOIDAL SILVER</b></h3> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>Silver is a potent bactericide and kills bacteria. Our early 
settlers would often throw silver dollars into their wells or water barrels to 
kill bacteria. During plagues in Europe, wealthy families gave their children 
silver spoons to suck on, hence the saying &ldquo;Born with a silver spoon in 
his mouth.&rdquo; Even in ancient Greece and Rome, people used silver 
containers to keep liquids fresh. Before World War 11, silver solutions were 
often used a topical antiseptic, and also as an oral, or even injected, 
antibiotic. It is highly effective and acts against a wide range of bacteria 
and yeasts. It is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Can be taken internally 
or applied topically and used as a general disinfectant. It is non- toxic and 
far less expensive than most prescription drugs.</p> 
<p>Most antibiotics have associated side effects, some being very serious, and 
tend to generate strains of microbes that are resistant to that antibiotic 
(because silver solution appears to be effective over a broad spectrum, it does 
not target specific mechanisms or receptors. For this reason it is unlikely 
that mutations of bacteria or viruses will produce resistant species). Many 
doctors are hesitant to prescribe antibiotics even for well-documented 
infections.There are no records of health endangering side effects.</p> 
<p>The EPA deems that even 1 oz (7-8 teaspoons) a day, for over 72 years is 
safe. Taking 1-2 teaspoons a day kills any bad bacteria entering the blood 
stream. It is better to kill the bacteria before a health problem arises.</p> 
<h3><b>COMFREY</b></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>We have used the fresh pulverized leaves of comfrey for&nbsp;<br>
over 30 
years, for the healing of sprains, pulled ligaments&nbsp;<br>
and bruising, 
with great success! I would not want to be&nbsp;<br>
without it. The powdered 
root in a burn paste has proven&nbsp;<br>
very successful as well.</p> 
<p><b>Making a poultice for external injuries:</b><br>
You are fortunate if 
you have the space to grow a&nbsp;<br>
plant of comfrey. For future needs you 
may want to&nbsp;<br>
prepare a ready to go poultice for immediate use or<br>

when the fresh leaf is not available. In a blender with&nbsp;<br>
water keep 
adding the fresh comfrey leaf as long as<br>
it will blend until you have a 
very thick paste. Place&nbsp;<br>
this thick-jel like substance into baggies, 
lay them flat&nbsp;<br>
and freeze.</p> 
<p>The leaves are more potent before the blossoms appear.<br>
Comfrey can be 
cut down as many as 7 times during a&nbsp;<br>
growing season, so you should be 
able to use new leaves<br>
for your poultices.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For a sprain, torn ligaments, bruising etc.,<br>
place comfrey gel on area, 
cover with gauze, then plastic to protect staining on clothes and cover with a 
cloth or ace bandage. Change once or twice a day. Within 3 days, or before, you 
will notice much healing. If the skin is broken, you will need an antiseptic 
solution to prevent infection.</p> 
<p>The BF&amp;C ointment, which can be applied along with, or<br>
in place of 
the fresh comfrey applications mentioned above, contains: comfrey root, white 
oak bark, mullein leaves, black walnut leaves, marshmallow root, wormwood herb, 
lobelia herb, skullcap, grave root, beeswax and olive oil. Apply externally. 
Once you have experienced the healing&nbsp;<br>
effects of this ointment, you 
will want to keep it available&nbsp;<br>
at all times.</p> 
<p><b>Recipe for BF&amp;C fomentation.</b><br>
6 parts oak bark<br>
6 parts 
comfrey root<br>
3 parts marshmallow root<br>
3 parts mullein herb<br>
2 parts 
wormwood<br>
3 parts walnut bark or leaves<br>
3 parts gravel root<br>
1 part 
lobelia<br>
1 part skullcap</p> 
<p>Soak this herb combination in distilled water (1 oz. of combined herbs to
<br>1 pint distilled water) 4-6 hours, then simmer for thirty minutes, strain 
and<br>
reduce the liquid down to its volume by simmering over low heat. To 
retard<br>
spoilage of large batches, add vegetable glycerin (2 gallon of tea 
simmered&nbsp;<br>
(not boiled) down to 2 quarts and add 1 pint of glycerin.</p>
<p><b>For an ointment, start with a melted base such as olive oil and beeswax.
<br></b>14 oz. olive oil<br>
2 oz. bees wax<br>
1/2 lb dry herbs or 1 lb fresh 
herbs</p> 
<p>Put ingredients into a closed container (stainless steel, earthenware, 
unchipped or&nbsp;<br>
unbroken enamel or glassware), and place into a warm 
oven the oven (200&deg; , or&nbsp;<br>
180&deg; F. for 3-4 hours. Lift the 
herbs occasionally with a fork to see if they are&nbsp;<br>
getting browned and 
brittle, and whether the oil has drawn the value from the herb.&nbsp;<br>

Strain and place in a jar.</p> 
<p>See instructions for making herb oils included in our Nature's Medicine 
Chest plant ID<br>
series.</p> 
<p><b>Burn Paste</b><br>
An effective paste for serious burns. Use equal 
amounts of wheat germ oil and honey (about 1/2 cup each ), then add enough 
comfrey powder to make a thin paste. You may need to add more honey to thin it. 
Mix the honey and oil, in a blender when possible, gradually adding the 
comfrey. Cover and keep cool. Do not remove the burned skin. Apply burn paste 
on the affected area and bandage. Do not wash or take off old paste,unless it 
falls off, but just keep adding a little more paste on top of the old, each day.
</p> 
<p>You will find the body soaks it in. You will see miraculous healing within 
2- 3 weeks. The paste may be preserved by adding a little glycerine but better 
when made fresh. The alternative is to have the burned skin scraped off and 
skin grafting by a plastic surgeon. It's your choice.</p> 
<h3><b>ECHINACEA</b></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Your wellness begins with your immune system. Echinacea is one of the most 
potent&nbsp;<br>
and well researched herbal substances for building a strong 
immune system. The active&nbsp;<br>
compounds in echinacea are said to increase 
the ability of white blood cells to surround&nbsp;<br>
and destroy bacterial 
and viral invaders.&nbsp;It has antibiotic, antiviral and 
anti-inflammatory&nbsp;<br>
properties. For acute conditions take large doses, 
1 cup of the decoction or 1 teaspoon&nbsp;<br>
of the tincture every 2 hours , 
for 10 days. For chronic conditions use in combinations&nbsp;<br>
and take 1/2 
cup of the combined decoction or 1 teaspoon of the combined tincture,&nbsp;<br>

3 times a day. Could combine with calendula, red clover blossoms.</p> 
<p>Many times we think we are allergic to certain foods, plants or animals, 
but in reality our&nbsp;<br>
immune system may just be over reacting. A simple 
combination of marshmallow root and<br>
astragalus can help those who suffer 
from&nbsp;allergies, hayfever, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;<br>
or any 
hyperactive immune response.</p> 
<h3><b>GARLIC</b></h3> <b> 
<p></p> </b> 
<p>Garlic is often referred to as a &quot;miracle food&quot; and it more than 
lives up to that description.&nbsp;<br>
There is not much this herb cannot do. 
Can you think of any other food that is proven to fight&nbsp;<br>
infection, 
thin the blood, alleviate high blood pressure, lower cholesterol, stimulate the 
immune<br>
system, treat lung infections and prevent cancer? It is one of the 
most valuable foods on this&nbsp;<br>
planet and has been used since Biblical 
times, heralding its value for endurance and strength.</p> 
<p><br>
It is the a potent natural antibiotic estimated to be equivalent to 1 
percent of that of penicillin.<br>
You can buy garlic bulbs from your local 
grocery store or natural food store. It is available as<br>
a powder, granules 
and in commercial capsules either as an oil or powder (aged products with&nbsp;
<br>no odor are not effective for infections). Fresh garlic is the most potent. 
Cut finely, press or&nbsp;<br>
crush 1 clove and take several times a day. 
Swallow with water or a little fennel tea. Chewing&nbsp;<br>
a little parsley, 
mint, caraway or fennel seeds or putting a drop of peppermint oil on your 
tongue&nbsp;<br>
can help eliminate the garlic odor on your breath, also see 
information above on charcoal,&nbsp;<br>
on bad breath. A therapeutic dose is 
2-3 cloves daily with meals, either cooked or raw.</p> 
<p>Yes, garlic can lower cholesterol, thin the blood and prevent dangerous 
blood clots (by<br>
making blood platelets less sticky). Studies at Cornell, 
Pennsylvania State University and&nbsp;<br>
other top Institutions, prove 
garlic stops heart attacks before they begin, helps in ulcers, and<br>
that it 
significantly reduces the rates of stomach and colorectal cancer. According to 
herbalist&nbsp;<br>
Joyn Heinerman Ph.D, raw garlic lowers high blood sugar 
levels which eases diabetes.<br>
During the 1980's researchers at Brigham Young 
University found that garlic kills cold viruses,<br>
flu viruses and the herpes 
viruses responsible for cold sores and venereal disease. Other<br>
studies have 
shown garlic's ability to kill bacteria resistant to antibiotics and meat 
seasoned&nbsp;<br>
with garlic is protected against the killer bug E.coli!</p> 
<p>Garlic and its related compounds have been found to lower bad cholesterol 
levels by over&nbsp;<br>
15 % and have successfully reduced blood pressure up 
to 20% in people suffering from<br>
hypertension.</p> 
<p>As a preventative use 1-2 cloves a day either raw (crushed or chopped 
finely), in salads,<br>
dressings, or soups. This helps to fight off head 
colds, sinus infections, to prevent consti-<br>
pation and yeast infections. 
When eating it raw, you could chew a sprig of parsley afterward&nbsp;<br>
to 
clear your breath.</p> 
<p>Rubbing a clove of this natural antifungal and antiseptic over your skin it 
can help to clear&nbsp;<br>
away acne, blemishes and skin rashes.</p> 
<p>An excellent cough syrup is made with 1 cup honey, 5-10 cloves of garlic, 1 
tablespoon of&nbsp;<br>
sage leaf, the juice from 1 medium lemon and 1 
tablespoon lemon peel, fresh or dried. Pour&nbsp;<br>
the honey into a blender, 
Add the garlic cloves, lemon juice and peel, and sage leaf. Blend on<br>
high 
speed until smooth. Let the blend steep for several days away from the heat. 
Squeeze&nbsp;<br>
out the liquid. Strain and bottle it. If you plan on keeping 
it longer than a week, keep it in the&nbsp;<br>
refrigerator.</p> 
<p>Another simple all-natural cough syrup is to take the juice of one boiled 
lemon, thicken&nbsp;<br>
with honey and add 2-3 crushed cloves of garlic.</p> 
<p>For an earache use garlic oil or an oil blend of mullein and garlic (found 
in most health&nbsp;<br>
stores). Drip a few drops of the oil in both ears, 
even if only one is hurting, place a piece&nbsp;<br>
of cotton in ear to keep 
from running out. Be sure to build up the immune system.</p> 
<p>To make garlic oil, add peeled whole garlic cloves to a quart of olive oil 
(add the amount&nbsp;<br>
according to the taste or potency you want). Be sure 
to wash your hands thoroughly and&nbsp;<br>
rinse the garlic after peeling and 
before placing it in the oil. Keep refrigerated. It will keep&nbsp;<br>
a month 
before you need to replace it with fresh oil. This can be used for 
saut&eacute;ing, in salad&nbsp;<br>
dressings.&nbsp;Add a few crushed cloves of 
garlic to as many of your meal preparations that<br>
you can, good in 
guacamole, stir-fry, sauces, or roast them in the oven.</p> 
<p><b>Caution:</b> avoid the use of garlic if you are nursing. Raw garlic can 
sometimes irritate you&nbsp;<br>
stomach if you eat too much.<b><br>
</b></p> 
<h3><b>GINGER</b></h3> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b><b><b><b></b></b></b><br>
<b><b>&nbsp;</b>
</b><br>
Jamaica ginger root is best. It can be taken in teas, capsules, pills, 
or any way you desire. The fresh root is chewed for cases of paralysis of the 
throat, hemorrhage of the lungs and salivary glands. The fresh chopped root is 
also used (from a teaspoon or by the pound) in bath water for burning of 
dermatitis, to relieve sore muscles, bruising, exhaustionetc.</p> 
<p>It can be prepared in many forms: bolus,essence, liniment, in massage oil, 
liquid extract, plaster,&nbsp;<br>
poultice, tincture, syrup .It is used in 
capsule or tea form generally in equal parts with other<br>
herbs. It combines 
with almost any other herbs. It accentuates most of the herbs for the&nbsp;<br>

lower abdominal and colon areas. Use with other herbs for an enema.</p> 
<p>The tea eases indigestion and flatulence and reduces fever. Use only in 
small doses to&nbsp;<br>
prevent morning sickness. The usual amount to use 
would be 1 cup of the tea, at a time.<br>
For babies it is the same proportion, 
but just give less of it in a eye dropper. Use distilled&nbsp;<br>
water and 
dilute it for very small babies. Ginger tea is excellent for trouble in the 
genital-<br>
reproductive organs, for menstrual cramps; you may be amazed at 
how effective it is.&nbsp;<br>
When using it in oil form it would be 2-3 drops 
in a cupful of water. A tincture would be<br>
5-20 drops, and 500 milligrams 
when using it in powder form. You can put 1 drop of the<br>
essential oil in a 
massage blend to relieve muscular pain, rheumatism, lumbago, and&nbsp;<br>

fatigue. A steam inhalation treats colds and lung infections.</p> 
<p>For painful gas problems try 1 teaspoon each ginger and baking soda. Place 
in a glass&nbsp;<br>
of warm to hot water and sir until the water clears. Drink 
as needed. To make a poultice&nbsp;<br>
for boils etc. mix equal amounts of 
ginger and flour (cornmeal or flax seed meal) with&nbsp;<br>
enough water to 
make a thick paste and apply it amply over the affected area. Cover&nbsp;<br>

with plastic and bandage. For a mild laxative put 1/4 teaspoon ginger powder, 
20 leaves&nbsp;<br>
of senna and 1 slice of lemon into 1/3 cup boiling water. 
Cover and let steep 10 minutes.<br>
Strain and drink the clear liquid. Sweeten 
with honey if desired.</p> 
<h3><b>HONEY</b></h3> 
<p><b></b>Honey has advantages over other sugars: It provides a maximum of 
energy. It is easy on<br>
the kidneys, lessening tissue destruction. It is 
non-irritating to the delicate membranes of&nbsp;<br>
the digestive tract and 
is assimilated quickly and easily. It enables an athlete to recuperate<br>

rapidly from over exertion and fatigue, according to standardized medical 
tests. This report&nbsp;<br>
suggests that it is possible to use larger amounts 
of honey compared to other sweets&nbsp;<br>
because of the ease in which honey 
is assimilated.</p> 
<p>An old time and effective relief for sinus and hayfever problems, is to 
chew honeycomb or&nbsp;<br>
honey cappings (and honey pollen if available). For 
a sinus attack, chew a mouthful for&nbsp;<br>
about fifteen minutes, discard 
and repeat, 4-6 times a day. An acute attack should subside<br>
in half a day 
to a day with the nasal passages opening up and the pain gone. Chew the&nbsp;
<br>honeycomb once a day after that for a week to prevent a recurrence. Eat 
honey as part of&nbsp;<br>
your diet for general relief. For hayfever sufferers 
try chewing the honeycomb once a day for<br>
1 month before the hay-fever 
season starts. If attacks are moderately severe chew honey<br>
-comb or 
cappings in honey 5 times a day for 2 days and reduce the dose to 3 times a 
day&nbsp;<br>
as long as needed. It will either not appear or be very mild. If 
the honeycomb or cappings are&nbsp;<br>
not available. 2 teaspoonful of honey 
will bring almost the same results. For severe cases of&nbsp;<br>
hayfever, 
start treatment at least 3-4 months before the pollen season commences with one
<br>tablespoonful of honey, or honeycomb or cappings after each meal, and a 
tablespoonful of&nbsp;<br>
honey in a glass of water at bedtime. Two weeks 
before the onset of pollen take 2 teaspoonful<br>
of honey in 2 teaspoonful of 
apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before breakfast and before&nbsp;<br>

retiring at night. Condinue this during the hayfever season. Take a teaspoonful 
of honey and if<br>
possible chew comb or cappings during the day to keep the 
nose open and dry.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> honey capping is the thin wax cappings which are sliced from a 
comb of honey before&nbsp;<br>
it is put into the honey extractor.</p> 
<p>Mineral shortage in the diet causes loss of energy and vitality. We use too 
many devitalized<br>
foods that have been robbed, through processing, of their 
mineral content. The mineral content&nbsp;<br>
of honey is not high (dark honey 
having 4 times as much iron as the light honeys), but as&nbsp;<br>
slight as 
the mineral value of honey may seem, if you take 1 tablespoon in the morning 
and&nbsp;<br>
one in the afternoon, there will be a noticeable difference in 
weight, energy, vivacity and general&nbsp;<br>
appearance.</p> 
<p>Honey that has not been strained, filtered and overheated are also high in 
vitamins. Locate a&nbsp;<br>
pure, unfiltered, raw honey for the results 
mentioned above. Honey is an excellent medium&nbsp;<br>
for vitamins. Unlike 
other fresh foods that loose vitamins when they are picked or stored, 
honey&nbsp;<br>
keeps the vitamin content when stored. Honey is the only food 
that stays fresh for thousands&nbsp;<br>
of years.</p> 
<p>It is well known that the main cause of fatigue is an over-acid body. The 
best prevention and&nbsp;<br>
cure is to keep your body at a balanced 
alkaline-acid level. The foods that are the most acid-<br>
forming are beef, 
eggs, oysters, oatmeal, wheat, wheat flour, rice and white bread. Honey is&nbsp;
<br>a little acid to the taste, just as lemons are acid to the taste but they 
have an&nbsp;<br>
alkaline effect.</p> 
<p><b>Bee Pollen</b><br>
Increases strength and endurance. It is rich in 
nutrients, enzymes, and boron which is<br>
needed for calcium absorption and 
brain function, plus it has all the amino acids the body&nbsp;<br>
needs. 
Excellent for hair, since normal hair growth is reduced by a lack of amino 
acids.&nbsp;<br>
Helps the immune system, builds resistance to disease and has 
a cleansing effect on the&nbsp;<br>
blood. Try to purchase it within a 20 mile 
radius of your home. Start with a small amount,<br>
1/2 teaspoon and increase 
to 1 tablespoon daily, in juices, cereals. You could make it into&nbsp;<br>
a 
sweet treat, by adding it to a ground dried fruit, honey and a favorite 
flavoring. We make a&nbsp;<br>
delicious treat by adding lemon and mint or 
carob powder, chopped nuts, roasted sesame&nbsp;<br>
seeds etc. Be creative 
according to your taste.</p> 
<h3><b>WATER</b></h3> 
<p><b></b>Water is the most powerful healing remedy of anything we ingest. 
Dehydration is the&nbsp;<br>
number one cause of constipation. But if you 
commit to drinking at least 8 glasses of&nbsp;<br>
water daily, you will not 
have any stress and strain in the bathroom. Pure water is the&nbsp;<br>
best. 
Water composition of the body is 75% of the muscles, 75% of your brain, 
83%&nbsp;<br>
of your blood and 20% of your bones. Losing just one percent of 
your body's fluids can&nbsp;<br>
cause discomfort and pain. Losing 5% may cause 
hallucinations and a drop of 15%&nbsp;<br>
results in death. See&nbsp;Food

when needed.</b></p> 
<p><b>ALLERGIES, HAYFEVER</b><br>
Toxins in the bloodstream is a main cause 
for allergic reactions.&nbsp;<br>
Anything that weakens the immune system, like 
poor digestion, stress,&nbsp;<br>
worry, fear, wrong food, etc. can cause 
allergies.</p> 
<p>For pollen allergies take raw crude pollen (best within a 20 mile radius of 
where you live).&nbsp;<br>
It relieves this type of allergy within a half an 
hour.&nbsp;<br>
Take a 1 teaspoon 3 times a day, for 3 days. Repeat when 
needed. See also information&nbsp;<br>
under Honey.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATIONS:<br>
In the spring and summer, treat hay fever with 
herbal and nutritional remedies.&nbsp;<br>
You will find the symptoms are 
reduced or eliminated without the side-effects&nbsp;<br>
of prescription or 
other over-the-counter medicines.</p> 
<p><b>Herbal Program for Hay Fever and Allergies</b> - from Janet Zand.&nbsp;
<i><b>It really works!<br>
</b></i></p> 
<p><b>Week 1<br>
</b>Echinacea and&nbsp;Goldenseal combination (15-20 drops or 
2 tabs, 3 times daily)<br>
Pantothenic Acid (Vit. B5) (100-250 mg, 2-3 times 
daily)</p> 
<p><b>Week 2<br>
</b>Astragalus, alone or as part of a formula (1 dose, 3 
times daily)</p> 
<p><b>Week 3</b><br>
Echinacea and&nbsp;Goldenseal combination (15-20 drops or 
2 tabs, 3 times daily)<br>
Pantothenic Acid (Vit.B5) (100-250 mg, 2-3 times 
daily)</p> <b>Week 4</b> <br>
Astragalus, alone or as part of a formula (1 
dose, 3 times daily) 
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><br>
Licorice may be used during Week 2 and Week 4 for 
additional support.<br>
Caution should be used by those with high blood 
pressure or who have a<br>
tendency toward water retention.</p>  Important to 
consider your diet. Avoid foods that are offensive to you<br>
during the hay 
fever season (i.e. wheat, milk, dairy, nuts and nut butters) 
<p>By detoxifying the intestines, you can often reduce and even eliminate<br>

allergic reactions. A colon cleanse is advised in some cases of hay fever.</p> 
<p><b>ARTHRITIS, GOUT</b><br>
Arthritis, bursitis, gout, tennis elbow, hips 
and shoulders are caused by&nbsp;<br>
deposits of crystallized uric acid in the 
joints. A diet of red meat, chicken,&nbsp;<br>
refined foods, sugar, salt and 
other acid foods should be eliminated.&nbsp;<br>
Drink at least 8 glasses of 
distilled water and establish an alkaline way of eating.</p> 
<p>Apple Cider Vinegar:<br>
Apple cider vinegar and citrus juices are very 
high in organic acids, which can wash<br>
and clean your joints, flushing out 
the inorganic acids, the uric acids etc. Take&nbsp;<br>
2 tablespoons to 1-1 
1/2 cups water, 3-5 times a day and a citrus juice fast,&nbsp;<br>
especially 
lemons and limes which are the most alkalizing to the body. Other<br>
juices 
will work but will take twice as long. Sam Biser indicates you will see 
great&nbsp;<br>
improvement within 3 weeks. Of course, you'll need to get off 
foods that are acid-<br>
forming (beef, fish, chicken, dairy, sugar etc.) Check 
out his web page for more on&nbsp;<br>
deep tissue repair for arthritis and 
many other excellent helps with health problems.&nbsp;<br>

usual.</p> 
<p>TREE TEA OIL<br>
This is an oil that is effective anti-fungal agent and 
works great when applied directly on the feet.</p> 
<p>MEDICINAL HERBS:&nbsp;<br>
pau d&rsquo;arco tea (drink 3 cups a day) or a 
strong tea&nbsp;<br>
(6 tea bags to 2 quarts water) for soaking the feet (15 
min. 3 times a day).&nbsp;<br>
Tea tree oil (20 drops to about 4 quarts of 
water) is also excellent for soaking<br>
(same amount of time). Dry thoroughly 
and put a few drops of the undiluted<br>
tea on the affected area. You may want 
to try soaking the area in apple<br>
cider vinegar or a tincture or strong tea 
of goldenseal root. Supplement<br>
with Vitamins A, B, and C.</p> 
<p><b>EXTERNAL BLEEDING<br>
</b><b>For cuts:</b> place&nbsp;cayenne pepper 
directly on cut (does not sting).&nbsp;<br>
Stops bleeding in 10-30 seconds and 
prevents scarring.</p> 
<p><b>For nose bleeds:</b> if caused by dryness, use&nbsp;aloe vera gel, 
calendula ointment&nbsp;<br>
or&nbsp;comfrey ointment. Put pressure, with your 
finger, on the upper lip, just under the nose.&nbsp;<br>
Take 3,000 mg of Vit.C 
with bioflavonoids when bleeding starts and 1,000 mg every&nbsp;<br>
hour until 
bleeding has completely stopped. Vit.K&nbsp;<br>
(alfalfa, cornsilk, Irish 
moss,&nbsp;kelp,&nbsp;shepherds&rsquo; purse) used with Vit.C also helps.<br>

Can snuff&nbsp;Cayenne Pepper (painful for a few minutes but works immediately).

<p><b>BRUISING, SPRAINS<br>
</b>HERBS: A fresh&nbsp;comfrey leaf poultice, 
blended to a thick gel, and placed&nbsp;<br>
on the bruised, broken or sprained 
area works miraculously!&nbsp;<br>
Wrap with gauze or a cloth, then an ace 
bandage to hold it in place.&nbsp;<br>
Cover with plastic to protect items from 
staining.&nbsp;<br>
Give it 2-3 days, changing with new comfrey each day.&nbsp;
<br>A comfrey ointment or oil is also very effective.&nbsp;<br>
You could 
alternate when poultice is inconvenient.</p> 
<p>HERBAL FORMULAS:&nbsp;A mixture of the following, made into an ointment, is
<br>excellent healing agent for bones, flesh and cartilage - white oak bark,<br>
comfrey root,&nbsp;mullein leave,&nbsp;black walnut leaves,&nbsp;marshmallow 
root,<br>
wormwood herb,&nbsp;lobelia herb,&nbsp;skullcap herb, gravel root, 
beeswax, olive oil,<br>
and wheat germ oil.</p> 
<p><b>Note</b>: This above combination is called BF&amp;C (bones, flesh and 
cartilage)<br>
It is an aid for malfunction in bone, flesh, cartilage and is 
excellent for accelerating<br>
the healing process for sprains, pulled muscles 
or tendons, breaks, calcium spurs,<br>
tremors, skin eruptions, varicose veins, 
etc. For recipe to make this see Comfrey.</p> 
<p><b>BURNS</b><br>
Become knowledgeable on the treatment for many different 
types of burns. I<br>
will include a few that have proven very successful.</p> 
<p>Basic Burn Information:<br>
1st-degree burns are red and painful (sunburns, 
scalds.)<br>
2nd degree burns blister, ooze and are painful (contact with oven 
coils, severe sunburn)<br>
3rd degree burns are charred, white colored (from 
chemicals, electricity or<br>
prolonged contact with a hot surface</p> 
<p>Gently wrap the burn in a clean dry cloth or thick gauze pad. Burns should
<br>be allowed to begin the healing process on their own. Wrap the burn in a<br>
clean, dry cloth or gauze pad and leave alone for the first 24 hours. After<br>

that, wash gently with soap and water once a day. Keep it covered, dry and<br>

clean between washings. After 2-3 days, apply healing ointments. Leave<br>

blisters intact, if it pops, clean with soap and water, then smooth on an<br>

ointment. Wash grease or dirt from the burn with soap and water. Flush the<br>

burn with lots of cold, not ice, water (15-30 minutes) or apply cold, wet<br>

towels.</p> 
<p>COLLOIDAL SILVER<br>
Spray silver solution directly onto the wound. Leave 
uncovered and wet for 5-20&nbsp;<br>
minutes per application. Apply 1-3 times 
per day, depending on severity. It is&nbsp;<br>
reported the burns and cuts 
will heal very rapidly with virtually no visible scarring.</p> 
<p>HERBS: For minor burns -&nbsp;aloe, Irish moss, drink&nbsp;comfrey or&nbsp;
horsetail tea, 3<br>
cups a day. For 2nd degree burns or worse - make a thin 
paste of&nbsp;comfrey<br>
powder, wheat germ oil and honey (a most miraculous 
healing agent). Place<br>
on burn. No need to scrape skin away. A 3rd degree 
burn will take up to 3<br>
weeks or more and should leave no scarring.</p> 
<p>For an excellent Burn Paste, see information under&nbsp;comfrey.</p> 
<p><b>COLDS, FLU &amp;&nbsp;STREP THROAT<br>
</b>Act immediately: The minute 
you feel something coming on, don&rsquo;t delay.</p> 
<p>&quot;Nutri Biotic Caps Plus&rdquo; (available at most health stores) is 
excellent for virus.</p> 
<p>Fortify the immune and lymph system: by cleansing the colon and liver. Drink
<br>lots of pure water, and green drinks. Eat raw vegetables, sprouts and no<br>
acid foods (see list, under&nbsp;cleansing)</p> 
<p><i>To eliminate toxins quickly: </i>Take 2 capsules, or 1 teaspoon cayenne 
pepper,<br>
and immediately get into as hot a shower as you can. Keep towel 
wrapped tightly,<br>
take the same amount of cayenne and immediately get into a 
warm bed. Put on<br>
extra blankets in order to help sweat out the toxins...or 
soak 15 minutes in a very<br>
hot bath to which yarrow blossoms or chopped 
fresh ginger root (tied in a cloth)&nbsp;<br>
have been added. Drink also in 
tea form, hot. Get into a warm bed immediately to<br>
sweat out toxins.</p> 
<p>Garlic is a strong natural antibiotic. If you did nothing else but take 1 
or more fresh,<br>
pressed garlic pearls, drinking it down with water, 3 times 
a day you would have an<br>
excellent product for fighting infection!</p> 
<p>HERBS: drink&nbsp;peppermint,&nbsp;elder flower and&nbsp;yarrow tea.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION FOR INFECTION:<br>
Plaintain leaf,&nbsp;black walnut leaf

tincture or capsules. It is also good if you have caught a cold or flu.
<br>Spray or diffuse room with Fir Needle essential oil to kill bacteria or<br>

virus in the air. A little lemon essential oil mixed with water makes a<br>

great antiseptic. Rub on hands when you go out in public to prevent picking<br>

up germs (from shaking hands, touching doorknobs, etc.<br>
Take&nbsp;catnip 
enema. Drink 1/2 to 1 gallon water (distilled) throughout the day.</p> 
<p>THROAT<br>
Follow the same suggestions under colds for cleansing and diet.
</p> 
<p>To relieve sore throat, strep or staph:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>  1 tablespoon honey, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, 1 clove <br>

pressed garlic. Mix together and eat as needed. If you cannot<br>
handle 
cayenne replace it with equal parts honey and fresh lemon. </li> 
<li>  &quot;07&quot; stabilized oxygen (available in Health stores) - lean 
head back and drip a few&nbsp;<br>
drops directly onto throat. </li> </ul> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;amaranth,&nbsp;barberry,&nbsp;comfrey,&nbsp;fenugreek,&nbsp;
goldenseal,&nbsp;mallow,&nbsp;sage,<br>
savory,&nbsp;slippery elm,&nbsp;sumac
,&nbsp;white oak bark,&nbsp;white pond lily, wintergreen,<br>

<p><br>
<b>COLIC</b><br>
If symptoms are continual crying, rather than 
occasional, (and longer than 2 months),&nbsp;<br>
throwing up and not just 
spitting up, it is most likely another problem besides Colic.</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;peppermint and&nbsp;ginger tea or extract&nbsp;wild yam root
,&nbsp;catnip,&nbsp;angelica,<br>
camomile, dill, summer savory, 
wintergreen,&nbsp;motherwort,&nbsp;valerian, burnet.<br>

caraway, or carrot.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: make a tea of the following or use separately &ndash; 
equal<br>
partscatnip,&nbsp;fennel,&nbsp;peppermint or&nbsp;spearmint. Use 
&frac12;-1 teaspoon of the herb<br>
or the mixed herbs to 1 cup water 
(depending on the age of child).</p> 
<p>Rice Milk Formula for babies with colic, allergies to other milks etc.<br>

(this has worked when nothing else has)<br>
1 cup brown short grain rice<br>
7 
cups distilled water<br>
2 tablespoons rice syrup<br>
1 strip (6-7 Inches) 
Kamboo sea weed<br>

</p> 
<p>If pain in stomach persists. Check with a Gastro specialist.</p> 
<p><b>DIARRHEA</b><br>
Can be caused by a number of problems: parasites, 
colitis, stress, viruses,<br>
chemicals, allergies, or diet. A strong 
Acidophilus will usually check it within 1-3<br>
days. Acidophilus is also good 
for constipation problems.</p> 
<p>HERBS: Sunflower leaf tea. (make a tea of 1 teaspoon of the chopped leaf to
<br>1 cup water). Take only &frac12; to 1 teaspoon of the tea, depending on 
age, 2-3<br>
times a day or until the diarrhea stops. Do not overdose as it may 
stop up<br>
your bowels longer than you want it to. This is a very potent 
remedy. Other<br>
teas to drink would be blackberry root tea,&nbsp;red 
raspberry leaf,&nbsp;comfrey,<br>
dandelion,&nbsp;alfalfa,&nbsp;cayenne,&nbsp;
garlic,&nbsp;ginger,&nbsp;gentian,&nbsp;golden seal,&nbsp;hawthorn,<br>
kelp
,&nbsp;licorice,&nbsp;lobelia, myrrh,&nbsp;oat straw,&nbsp;red clover,&nbsp;
slippery elm,&nbsp;white<br>
oak bark, wormwood or&nbsp;camomile.</p> 
<p><br>
<b>EARACHE</b><br>
Allergies have been linked to the cause of ear 
infections. Eliminate dairy<br>
products, grains. Infants should not be given 
grains until they are 1 year old.<br>
Use the same cleansing and diet program 
as listed under colds.</p> 
<p>HERBS: drop warmed&nbsp;garlic,&nbsp;lobelia and&nbsp;mullein oil into each 
ear (even if only one is hurting).&nbsp;<br>
Most health stores carry these 
drops combined. Place cotton in ears.</p> 
<p>COLLOIDAL SILVER<br>
Lie down on bed or couch with affected ear facing up. 
Place 5-7 drops of colloidal<br>
silver in the ear. Remain in this lying 
position for a minimum of 10 minutes, preferably<br>
for a least 30 minutes. 
Repeat 2-3 times per day. Noticeable improvement has been<br>
reported in as 
little as 4-24 hours.</p> 
<p>See information under&nbsp;Garlic</p> 
<p><b>EYE IRRITATIONS</b><br>
Cataracts can form when vitamin C, B2, lysine 
and tryptophan are low. Other<br>
conditions are inflammation, pink eye, tired 
or sore eyes.</p> 
<p>HERBS: make an eyewash of the following teas (strain well) - borage flowers,
<br>rosemary,&nbsp;eyebright herb,&nbsp;sage or&nbsp;goldenseal root.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: an excellent formula which comes in capsules or<br>

tincture, available in herb or health stores, consists of bayberry bark,<br>

eyebright herb,&nbsp;golden seal root,&nbsp;red raspberry leaf and&nbsp;cayenne
. 2 capsules<br>
can be taken 3 times a day. The tincture can be diluted and 
used as any eye<br>
wash, either with drops or in an eye cup wash the eye with 
an Herbal<br>
Eyebright formula either by dropper or in eye wash bath. Stings 
but works.<br>
Clears up infection. Sometimes it takes a few weeks, so 
don&rsquo;t give up. It<br>
also makes the eyes bright and shiny.</p> 
<p>A fennel eye bath for tired, dry eyes and clearer vision - make a tea from 
fennel&nbsp;<br>
seed. Diluted 1 to 1 with water and a pinch of salt. Strain 
the tea through a very&nbsp;<br>
fine strainer and make fresh everyday. Use an 
eye bath, available at drug stores.<br>
Make sure everything you are using is 
very&nbsp;clean.</p> 
<p>Back to the top &gt;&gt;</p> 
<p><b>FEVER</b><br>
Fever is not a disease, but a symptom that may indicate 
the presence of<br>
disease. This defense mechanism of the body acts to destroy 
harmful<br>
microbes. Help the fever, rather than suppress it. Use instructions 
under<br>
colds along with herbs listed below. A garlic or catnip enema is very 
effective.</p> 
<p>HERBS: A tea of&nbsp;peppermint,&nbsp;elder flowers, boneset,&nbsp;sage
,&nbsp;yarrow, or quaking aspen.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: fresh&nbsp;garlic juice,&nbsp;comfrey leaves, wormwood 
herb,<br>
lobelia herb,&nbsp;marshmallow root,&nbsp;oak bark,&nbsp;mullein 
leaves,&nbsp;skullcap herb,&nbsp;uva<br>
ursi herb. (1 tablespoon ever hour as 
needed)</p> 
<p><b>FOOD POISONING</b></p> 
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea can flush out important electrolytes - potassium, 
sodium,&nbsp;<br>
and glucose. Take either Gatorade or a rehydration mix of 
fruit juice (for potassium),&nbsp;<br>
1/2 teaspoon honey ( for glucose) and a 
pinch of table salt (sodium chloride).</p> 
<p>Do not take an antacid or a antidiarrheal product. It could multiply the 
bacteria more&nbsp;<br>
rabidly, and in greater numbers which would interfere 
with the body's ability to fight the<br>
infection. Just let nature take its' 
course. Do not stick your finger down your throat!<br>
This is not necessary. 
Usually within a few hours to a day after the diarrhea and vomiting&nbsp;<br>

have subsided, you'll be&nbsp;ready for food. Keep it bland, cereal, pudding, 
soda crackers or&nbsp;<br>
broth. Avoid high-fiber, spicy, acidic, greasy, 
sugary, or dairy foods that could further<br>
irritate the stomach.</p> 
<p>An excellent product - stabilized oxygen, &quot;07&quot; can be used for 
food poisoning,<br>
dysentery, diarrhea, bronchitis, emphuysemis, 
sinus.&nbsp;Use 20-50 drops (50 drops for an&nbsp;<br>
adult, if you are really 
sick), 3 times a day, preferably in juice. Smaller doses for children.<br>
For 
a baby, use 5 drops.</p> 
<p>Using Apple Cider Vinegar:<br>
When there is food poisoning with vomiting, 
only drink teaspoonsful every few minutes.&nbsp;<br>
When the 1st glass is 
finished, take another, using 2 tsp. every 5 minutes. This will&nbsp;<br>
add 
another 2 hours of treatment. A 3rd glass should be taken with one small swallow
<br>every 15 minutes. If you wake up with nausea and vomiting and digestive 
upsets, follow&nbsp;<br>
the apple cider vinegar and water treatment throughout 
the day. Be sure to take extra&nbsp;<br>
vinegar and water 5 times a day or 
more for the next 3 days.</p> 
<p><b>GLANDS</b><br>
The lymph glands are the body&rsquo;s filter system. They 
remove toxins from the<br>
body, but if they are not working properly, toxins 
build up in the<br>
bloodstream. Cleanse system and detoxify.</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;alfalfa,&nbsp;barberry,&nbsp;black cohosh,&nbsp;black walnut
,&nbsp;burdock,&nbsp;cayenne,<br>
dandelion,&nbsp;echinacea,&nbsp;garlic,&nbsp;
gentian,&nbsp;ginseng,&nbsp;golden seal, gotu kola,<br>
hawthorn,&nbsp;hops 
,&nbsp;kelp,&nbsp;licorice.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: Rub the glands with&nbsp;mullein and&nbsp;lobelia 
ointment,<br>
Professor Cayenne's Herbal Balm or Exceptic, in downward strokes.
</p> <br>

<p><b>HEADACHES</b><br>
If you feel your headache is caused from a neck or 
back that is out, try<br>
hanging from a rod or door. Place doubled towel on 
top of door, near hinges.<br>
With hands on the toweling and your feet not 
touching the floor, let your<br>
whole body relax with the feel of the weight 
pulling on your lower back. Do it<br>
a few times, if you don't hear adjusting 
(tiny pops) in your back, try it<br>
again throughout the day, until you 
do.&nbsp;<b>CAUTION</b>: Do not try this if you have<br>
major back problems, 
if you are overweight, if the door or rod is not secure,<br>
or if you do not 
feel comfortable with it. It was a suggestion given to me by a<br>

Chiropractor, and it has worked for me as well as others for years. Another<br>

suggestion is to find sore spots along your shoulders, neck and back with 
your&nbsp;<br>
thumb or middle finger, press in hard, until the pain 
disappears. Try apple cider&nbsp;<br>
vinegar (2 tsp. vinegar in a glass of 
warm water and honey added, if desired).</p> 
<p>HERBS: drink&nbsp;peppermint and&nbsp;ginger tea,&nbsp;rosemary,&nbsp;catnip
, mate and mint tea,<br>
horsetail (a good source of silica necessary for bone 
and connective<br>
tissue).</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION:&nbsp;alfalfa,&nbsp;burdock,&nbsp;oat straw,&nbsp;
slippery elm, and&nbsp;white<br>
willow bark can be taken in capsule, extract 
or tea form.</p> 
<p>See information for headache relief under&nbsp;apple cider vinegar.</p> 
<p><b>HEMORRHOIDS</b><br>
They are much like varicose veins, which enlarge and 
lose their elasticity,<br>
resulting in saclike protrusions into the anal 
canal. Can be caused by<br>
sitting or standing at long periods, violent 
coughing, lifting, constipation.</p> 
<p>Drink lots of fluids, eat lots of fiber, prevent heavy lifting, choose a 
hemorrhoid<br>
cream over suppositories. Control your salt intake, coffee, 
strong spices, beer&nbsp;<br>
and cola. Aloe vera gel, applied directly on the 
anus can relieve the pain and soothe.</p> 
<p>HERBS: Drink&nbsp;yarrow or&nbsp;comfrey tea and bathe affected parts with 
a strong<br>
tea of the same. Use decoction of&nbsp;goldenseal root or witch 
hazel bark<br>
externally.&nbsp;Aloe vera gel, applied on the anus, relieves 
the burning. Collinsonia,&nbsp;<br>
also known as stoneroot has proven helpful, 
for centuries.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: A salve made of bayberry,&nbsp;goldenseal root, myrrh 
and<br>
white oak bark works even better than the commercial preparations. A 
paste<br>
made from powdered&nbsp;comfrey root can be used as a poultice to 
heal bleeding<br>
hemorrhoids.<i> A</i> dab of witch hazel applied to the 
rectum with a cotton ball is one<br>
of the very best remedies available for 
external hemorrhoids, especially if there<br>
is bleeding. A paste made from 
powdered comfrey root can be used in a poultice<br>
to heal bleeding 
hemorrhoids. (Comfrey is recommended for external use only)</p> 
<p><br>
<b>INSOMNIA</b><br>
It can be caused by anxiety, distress, pain, 
nervous exhaustion. Exercise<br>
and fresh air helps. A change of diet, which 
helps the nervous system, will<br>
definitely help. Try not to eat late, 
especially just before going to bed.</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;Passion flower,&nbsp;hops,&nbsp;valerian,&nbsp;catnip,&nbsp;
camomile,&nbsp;lobelia,&nbsp;skullcap,<br>

<p>HERBAL COMBINATION:&nbsp;black cohosh root,&nbsp;cayenne pepper,&nbsp;hops 
flowers,&nbsp;lobelia<br>
herb,&nbsp;skullcap herb,&nbsp;valerian root,&nbsp;
wood betony and&nbsp;mistletoe leaf.&nbsp;<br>
(2 capsules 3 times a day).</p> 
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> The blending of 4 herbs, kava, chamomile, hops and 
hawthorn, can help relax<br>
your body, mind, heart, and digestion, promoting a 
more refreshing night's sleep.</p> 
<p>See information also under apple cider vinegar.</p> 
<p><b>INDIGESTION</b><br>
Those who are ill, lack the ability to properly 
digest and assimilate their<br>
food. The main reason for this breakdown in 
digestion is the increased<br>
amount of cooked and processed foods in our 
diets. By cleansing and changing<br>
to an alkaline diet with fresh, raw 
vegetables, sprouts, soaked nuts and<br>
seeds, the body can build back the 
enzymes needed for digestion. Make sure<br>
you are getting enough water and 
exercise.</p> 
<p>CHARCOAL<br>
An effective treatment for indigestion and gas. Take between 1 
teaspoon to<br>
1 1/2 tablespoons of powdered charcoal up to 3 times a day 
(tablets are also&nbsp;<br>
available).You can take it between meals, as food 
can reduce its effectiveness.<br>
Swirl the charcoal in a glass of water and 
drink it down, or mix it with olive oil for&nbsp;<br>
easy ingestion by use of 
a spoon. See&nbsp;Charcoal</p>

<p><b>MENSTRUAL CRAMPS</b></p> 
<p>Each month, the lining of a woman's uterus produces chemicals called<br>

prostaglandins, which help the uterine muscles contract and expel tissue and<br>
fluids during menstruation. High levels of prostaglandins cause uterine muscle
<br>contractions or cramps. Dr.Penny Budoff, M.D. states many women needlessly
<br>suffer from this chemical problem.</p> 
<p>Menstrual pain is sometimes aggravated by tension, insufficient exercise, 
poor&nbsp;<br>
dietary habits, nervous tension, tight muscles, the use of 
stimulants, poor diet<br>
alcohol, caffeine, sugars etc. Eat more vegetables 
and fruit in small amounts<br>
through the day, rather than having 3 large 
meals.<br>
Be sure you have enough vitamins, minerals (especially calcium, 
potassium and<br>
magnesium) and take before and during your period. Do not 
take diuretics, rather<br>
drink more water.</p> 
<p>Warmth will increase your blood flow and relax you muscles, especially 
important<br>
in your cramped and congested pelvic area. Drink lots of hot herb 
tea or hot&nbsp;<br>
lemonade. Also put a heating pad or hot-water bottle on 
your abdomen for a&nbsp;<br>
few minutes at a time.<br>
Take a hot bath with 1 
cup each sea salt and baking soda . Soak for 20 minutes.<br>
Take a brisk walk, 
do yoga stretches.</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;Angelica root,&nbsp;cramp bark, kava,&nbsp;red raspberry,&nbsp;
black coholsh,<br>
blue cohosh,&nbsp;cramp bark, camomile, tea.&nbsp;<b><br>

(Do not use black cohosh if you are pregnant or have a chronic disease).</b></p>
<p>HERBAL FORMULA:&nbsp;black cohosh root,&nbsp;sarsaparilla root, 
American&nbsp;ginseng<br>
root,&nbsp;licorice root, false unicorn root,&nbsp;
blessed thistle herb and&nbsp;squaw vine<br>
herb ( 2 capsules 3 times a day). 
Note: To make this formula much more<br>
effective, take 2 soft gel capsules of 
wheat germ oil (by Viobin) per day, or you&nbsp;<br>
could take 1 teaspoon of 
the oil (if you don&rsquo;t mind the taste). This is also<br>
excellent for hot 
flashes for women going through menopause.</p> 
<p><i><b>Note:</b></i> a powerful blend that works well is 1 teaspoon each 
cramp bark, motherwort,<br>
valerian root, kava root, skullcap leaves and 
flowers in 4 cups water. Bring to boil,<br>
then simmer 20 minutes. Add 1 
tablespoon camomile flowers and let steep<br>
another 20 minutes. Drink 1 cup 
of the tea, 2-3 times daily before meals. Or you<br>
could mix 2 teaspoon each 
of the individual tinctures in a cup of water and drink<br>
1/2 cup, 2 times a 
day.</p> 
<p><b>SINUS PROBLEMS</b><br>
The sinuses are the first line of defense in 
protecting the lungs against<br>
infection. If they become clogged from too 
much mucus produced by the body,<br>
infection may set in.<br>
By cleansing, 
building the immune system, eating right, and especially<br>
keeping away from 
dairy products, mucus can be controlled.</p> 
<p>Acidophilus, bee pollen, vitamins A, B, C, E, Co Q10, and zinc lozenges are
<br>helpful. Use eucalyptus oil as a spray, rub, or add to essential oil 
diffuser, or<br>
humidifier. If rubbing on chest or around nose area, first rub 
on a little olive oil to&nbsp;<br>
keep from irritating skin.</p> 
<p>HERBS: Anise,&nbsp;fenugreek,&nbsp;marshmallow,&nbsp;red clover, bayberry 
may help to<br>
loosen phlegm and clear congestion,&nbsp;golden seal,&nbsp;
horehound,&nbsp;mullein,&nbsp;nettle.</p> 
<p>HERBAL COMBINATION: Place a 1-2 drops of the following oils, which have been
<br>blended together, olive, cassia, eucalyptus, cajeput oil, pure menthol plus
<br>camphor crystals, or Tie-Fu (an essential oil found in most health stores)
<br>on palm of hand, cup around the nose and breath in until passages clear.</p>
<p><br>
<b>SKIN IRRITATIONS</b><br>
There are many reasons for skin reactions. 
It functions as a means of<br>
excreting toxins from the body, just as the 
kidneys and bowels do. Some of<br>
the causes of skin problems are allergies to 
molds, foods, chemicals,<br>
cosmetics, insect bites, poison plants, fungi and 
much more. When skin<br>
rashes occur is it a good indication that the pancreas 
needs help or that<br>
your body needs cleansing to get rid of toxins. It can 
also be a valuable<br>
warning signal that you may have a potentially serious 
illness. Cleanse and<br>
rebuild.</p> 
<p>COLLOIDAL SILVER<br>
This product may help in certain skins problems.</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;Aloe vera gel,&nbsp;ginkgo biloba extract, green tea. Calendula,
<br>chamomile,&nbsp;elder flower, tea tree oil, olive leaf extract,&nbsp;oat 
straw tea can<br>
all be used externally for relief.</p>  Skin rashes, chicken 
pox, measles etc.-&nbsp;Chickweed or&nbsp; Plantain ointments. <br>
 Bites - 
A&nbsp;plantain poultice is especially helpful for insect, spider <br>
bites, 
bee stings. Try covering the bite with clay, a poultice of&nbsp;plantain,&nbsp; 
lobelia or mugwort. <br>
 Abscesses or boils - apply a poultice of&nbsp; lobelia
,&nbsp;mullein or&nbsp; comfrey and <br>
ground&nbsp; flaxseed. Drink&nbsp; 
burdock root or&nbsp; red clover tea often, to cleanse the blood. <br>
 Itch 
relief &ndash; lotion made from&nbsp;chamomile, tea tree oil and vitamin E. <br>
<p><br>
HERBAL COMBINATION: a poultice of&nbsp;chaparral, dandelion and&nbsp;
yellow dock root<br>
helps. An ointment made from&nbsp;oak bark,&nbsp;comfrey 
leaf,&nbsp;marshmallow root,<br>
mullein leaf,&nbsp;black walnut leaf, gravel 
root,&nbsp;wormwood herb,&nbsp;lobelia herb and<br>
skullcap herb is good.</p> 
<p><b>STRESS, NERVOUSNESS</b><br>
Caused by illness, trauma, injuries, life 
style changes. It has found to be<br>
a factor in colitis, ulcers, strokes, 
cancer, high blood pressure, heart<br>
attacks, headaches, and nervous 
breakdowns. To avoid this, cleanse, diet,<br>
exercise will help mentally and 
physically. The body needs extra B-complex,<br>
C and E vitamins, calcium with 
magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc.</p> 
<p>HERBS: Drink often -&nbsp;spearmint and&nbsp;skullcap tea,&nbsp;camomile, 
celery seed or<br>

<b>TOOTHACHE, SORE GUMS</b><br>
Diet is a major cause of tooth 
disease. It is a bacterial disease and rivals<br>
the common cold for the most 
prevalent human disorder. Tooth decay is not a<br>
natural process. It is 
caused by bacteria, sugars for the bacteria to feed<br>
on and the weakness of 
tooth enamel.</p> 
<p>Use antibacterial mouthwashes, inflammatory herbs, avoid refined sugars, 
soft<br>
drinks, chewable vitamin C. Use more foods and herbs high in calcium. 
Keep<br>
gums stimulated and to remove plaque, massage between your teeth with
<br>Stim-U-Dent (hold in mouth till soft).</p> 
<p>HERBS:&nbsp;camomile,&nbsp;hops, calendula,&nbsp;peppermint and&nbsp;yarrow 
tea. For anti inflammatory<br>
effects. For toothache: apply a small amount of 
clove oil or peppermint oil on tooth,<br>
with a swab stick.<br>
For sore gums 
- apply a decoction or diluted tincture of myrrh gum,<br>
goldenseal root or 
witch hazel to gums. Rub gums with eucalyptus oil. Massage gums&nbsp;<br>

daily. For teething -&nbsp;camomile or&nbsp;passion flower tea with honey. Rub 
gums with brandy.<br>
To ease pain &ndash; rinse area with warm salt water (1/2 
teaspoon to 8 oz. warm water)</p> 
<p><br>
<b>WARTS</b><br>
(A viral infection. There are over 60 types of warts)
<br>The following is a Vitamin therapy for the common wart.</p> 
<p>An excellent Vitamin therapy: Take every day for 1 month:<br>
Vit. A 20,000 
U<br>
Vit C 3,000<br>
Vit E 800 U<br>
Vitamin B complex 50 mg<br>
Continue 
taking a little longer if warts are leaving,but not quite gone.</p> 
<p>HERBS: Try any of the following: Rub the juice from a dandelion stem on the
<br>wart, 2-3 times a day. Crush a&nbsp;garlic clove and apply directly on wart 
only. Cover<br>
with a bandage and leave it in place for 24 hours. Repeat 
treatment until the<br>
wart blisters and falls off (takes about a week). You 
could make a paste of castor oil<br>
and baking soda and apply to the wart 
every night and bandage it (may take 3-6 weeks).</p> <br>

&nbsp;  Building Muscle &amp; Best Protein <br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Whey protein</strong> is considered by many to be the superstar of 
proteins -- nature's richest source of biologically active protein and one of 
the world&rsquo;s oldest &lsquo;health foods&rsquo;.
<p>What makes it so special?</p> 
<p>Several things&hellip;<br>
Whey protein is easy to digest and very 
bioavailable to your body. It's an extremely efficient protein. As such, it's 
digested so rapidly that it increases the refueling speed of your muscles 
during that critical time just following your workout.</p> 
<p><br>
Whey protein is rich in the amino acids critical for developing and 
sustaining new muscle mass. It contains every essential amino acid, plus some 
of the non-essential ones.<br>
Whey provides more Branch Chain Amino Acids 
(BCAAs) than any other protein source. The BCAAs are leucine (mentioned above), 
valine and isoleucine. These make up one third of the amino acid profile of 
your muscles. The BCAAs&rsquo; most important job is to assist in synthesizing 
other amino acids that muscle building requires, including glutamine.<br>
Whey 
supports your immune system by raising levels of glutathione &ndash; a tiny 
molecule that&rsquo;s found in every cell as its &lsquo;master&rsquo; 
antioxidant and detoxifier. It is one of your body's best-kept secrets in the 
war against free radicals and the normal signs of aging.<br>
Whey is often 
considered &lsquo;King&rsquo; of the proteins, and therefore can claim 
&lsquo;Most Valuable&rsquo; status in muscle building.</p>

<p><strong>For Building Muscle</strong></p> 
<p>The reasons why muscles wither with age is a problem that is intriguing a 
growing number of scientists. Drug companies are trying to develop drugs that 
can build muscles or forestall their weakening, while food companies are 
exploring nutritional products with the same objective.<br>
Both doctors and 
patients need to be more aware that muscle deterioration is a major reason the 
elderly lose mobility.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Nutrition</strong><br>
1. Increase your intake of leucine rich 
foods such as high quality whey protein, raw cheese and organic, pasture-raised 
eggs.<br>
2. Increase the gap between meals to potentiate the anabolic effect 
of each meal. Remember, fasting stimulates a substantial peak in muscle protein 
synthesis when feeding is resumed.<br>
3. Feed your muscle with quality whey 
protein after exercise. Make sure the whey protein is derived from grass fed 
cows and is cold processed. Note that whey protein is the fastest to assimilate 
among all protein foods. Its anabolic impact after exercise is unmatched. Whey 
protein is also ideal for muscle fueling before exercise. It has the highest 
content of leucine and BCAA among all foods.<br>
4. For best results, 
incorporate at least two recovery meals after exercise / 20g-30g protein per 
meal. 20g is about the threshold amount of protein needed to grant maximum 
utilization efficiency without wasting nitrogen.<br>
Keep 1-3 hours gap between 
meals (depends on meal size).<br>
Make all your muscle meals low glycemic. 
Avoid protein bars and powders made with added sugar. Note that mixing whey 
protein with low glycemic fruits such as berries is ok. This will not cause a 
substantial increase in the glycemic load of your meal.</p> 
<p>Additionally:<br>
1. Increase your intake of antioxidants from fruits and 
vegetables to support your muscle antioxidant defenses and allow recuperation 
and buildup.<br>
2. Stay away from any product made with added fructose. 
Fructose is the worst fuel for your muscles.<br>
3. Start your morning with a 
whey protein meal to cover your minimum leucine requirement. This will allow 
all additional protein meals to become increasingly anabolic (by releasing 
extra leucine for anabolic purposes).<br>
4. Use whey meals as a primary source 
of protein during the day to grant maximum protein/leucine loading efficiency 
with minimum digestive stress.<br>
5. Have your slow assimilating proteins 
(eggs, cheese, fish or meat) at night to grant a steady release of leucine and 
a long lasting anabolic impact during the sleeping hours.<br>
6. One way to 
spare leucine for anabolic purposes is by adding coconuts' MCT (medium chain 
triglycerides) to a whey protein meal. MCT has shown the capacity to swiftly 
convert to energy without spiking insulin and without the need for bile acid 
digestion. MCT can help shift leucine's pathway from fueling into muscle 
building.<br>
7. Keep your diet clean from chemicals, pesticides and 
preservatives to minimize the metabolic stress on your body. Accumulated 
metabolic stress and toxicity present major obstacles to muscle recuperation 
and buildup.<br>
Researchers believe that this unique role of leucine in the 
regulation of muscle protein synthesis is consistent with the sparing of lean 
body mass seen with high protein diets during weight loss.<br>
Note that the 
highest concentrations of leucine and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are 
found in dairy products; particularly quality cheese and whey protein. And even 
though leucine is relatively abundant in our food supply, it is often wasted as 
an energy substrate or used as a building block rather than an anabolic agent.
<br>This means that to establish the right anabolic environment, you should try 
to increase leucine consumption beyond maintenance requirements.<br>
But beware 
that only FOOD BASED leucine can benefit your muscles without side effects. 
Using leucine as a free form amino acid can be highly counterproductive.<br>

Intravenous administration of free form amino acids including leucine has shown 
to cause severe hyperglycemic reactions and insulin resistance. Apparently, 
when free form amino acids are artificially administrated, they rapidly enter 
the circulation while disrupting insulin function, and impairing your body's 
glycemic control.<br>
This proves again that we're programmed to benefit from 
whole food nutrition only.<br>
So how much leucine in the form of foods, NOT 
supplements, do you need to consume for getting results?<br>
Based on 
nitrogen-balance measurements, the requirement for leucine to maintain body 
protein is 1-3 grams daily. And to optimize its anabolic pathway, it has been 
estimated that leucine requirement should be about 8g - 16g daily.<br>
The 
following chart presents leucine content in common foods:<br>
Leucine Content 
in food / per 100g<br>
Whey Protein Concentrate 8.0g<br>
Raw Cheddar Cheese 3.6g
<br>Lean Beef 1.7g<br>
Salmon 1.6g<br>
Almonds 1.5g<br>
Chicken 1.4g<br>
Chick 
Peas 1.4g<br>
Raw Eggs 1.0g<br>
Egg Yolk 1.4g<br>
Sheep Milk 0.6g<br>
Pork 0.4g
<br>Cow Milk 0.3g<br>
This means that to get the minimum 8 gram leucine 
requirement for anabolic purposes, you need the following amounts of food:<br>

a pound and a half of chicken<br>
three pounds of pork<br>
over a pound of 
almonds (over 3000 calories)<br>
over a pound and a half of raw eggs (16 eggs)
<br>half a pound of raw cheddar cheese<br>
and remarkably, only 3oz of 
high-quality whey.<br>
As you can see, whey protein supplementation can 
effectively allow you to get the minimum leucine you need to build muscle 
without consuming freaky amounts of food and calories.<br>
Note that the 
anabolic impact of leucine is proportional to its availability and is dependent 
on its circulating levels. In other words, the more leucine you consume from 
food, the better chances for anabolic impact you get.<br>
But there is one more 
factor that can dictate whether you gain or lose muscle mass. And that's the 
glycemic factor.<br>
The Glycemic Factor<br>
As noted, the triggering of your 
mTOR to increase muscle mass requires healthy insulin and glucose homeostasis. 
Any impairment in the regulation of blood glucose and insulin activity could 
inactivate your mTOR and jeopardize your muscle protein synthesis.<br>
Studies 
have reported that dietary protein has beneficial stabilizing effect on insulin 
levels when entering the circulation from ingested food. In other words, 
protein food benefits your body's glycemic control. And furthermore, protein 
serves as a perfect fuel during times of fasting and intense physical hardship.
</p> 
<p><br>
Final Note<br>
Life isn't just about looking hard and feeling strong. 
And often you get too busy to pay attention to how you eat or exercise. 
Nevertheless, with the right knowledge and practice, you can become 
increasingly efficient in restoring and improving your physical shape even when 
your available time is scarce.<br>
The protocols suggested here can fit any 
lifestyle. Even 10 minutes of intense exercise can still yield positive results 
while you're on a super busy schedule. And you can easily pre-pack whey protein 
in your bag or case and bring it with you anywhere you go. Life requires you to 
act.<br>
The choice is now in your hands.</p>
