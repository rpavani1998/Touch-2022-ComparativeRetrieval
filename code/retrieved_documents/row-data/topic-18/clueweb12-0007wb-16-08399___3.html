<b>Question: </b>What's the best 
charcoal to use in my smoker?  Good Charcoal for smoking lasts a long time and 
produces a steady high heat. <b>Answer: </b>While there are those who will tell 
you that the best charcoal is actually hardwood logs, there are those people 
who live in the real world and use charcoal to produce heat for their smokers. 
Of course not all charcoals are created equal. The first rule is to avoid 
self-starting charcoals that have lighter fluid additives to get them burning. 
These leave a bad taste and are just not good for any kind of cooking. If you 
want an inexpensive charcoal go with something that has not additives. Charcoal 
should be as basic and clean as possible. You can add really wood for smoke 
flavor but avoid charcoals that promise things like &quot;;authentic mesquite 
flavor&quot;. Charcoal should also be kept completely dry.
<p>If you want to step up a level you can use what is know as lump charcoal. 
This isn't pressed sawdust like most charcoals, but is actual pieces of wood 
that have been fired into charcoal. Lump charcoal made from hardwood is as 
close to smoking with hardwood as you can get without splitting logs. Lump 
charcoal burns longer so you use less and have a much more flavorful smoke. 
Lump charcoal also costs more, but since it burns hotter and longer you use 
less so the in long run it isn't as expensive as you might think. Lump charcoal 
is also more available these days and can typically be found in places that 
sell smokers and outdoor cooking equipment.</p> <br>
