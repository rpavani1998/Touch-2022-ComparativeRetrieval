<h6>Types of fuel</h6> <br>
&nbsp; <br>

<p><strong>So different and so complementary:&nbsp; gas, charcoal and electric 
barbecues.</strong><br>
Gas, charcoal and electric barbecues all have their 
fervent supporters and their convinced adversaries. While the Europeans prefer 
charcoal, the Englishmen usually choose the gas type. On the contrary, the 
electric types&nbsp; are usually used where there is limited room, such as a 
camp site or on a small balcony. The different types of appliances are used in 
different ways. They complement each other perfectly and therefore you can 
purchase them all. In this way you can enjoy your barbecue preparations, 
according to your full desires and tastes.</p> <br>
<br>

<h6>Charcoal</h6> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>A charcoal barbecue of average quality has a temperature on the 
surface of a minimum of 500&deg;.&nbsp; This temperature, &nbsp;for example, is 
ideal to grill ribs or to prepare them rare.<br>
</strong> You need a lot of 
patience with the traditional charcoal barbecues, since it takes about forty 
minutes just to create a decent charcoal fire . barbecook&reg; shortens this 
time thanks to the Quickstart&reg;&nbsp; system. From now on you can start up 
every charcoal fire just by using some newspaper and you can start grilling 
within fifteen minutes.</p> 
<p> As a preparation for the charcoal you can regulate the height of the 
grillers and the intensity of the flames. After barbecuing you don't need to 
remove the ashes nor the pyrolysis. The griller will be sterilized thanks to 
the intense heat of the next session.</p> 
<p> Grilling on a nice glowing charcoal fire is a very pleasant activity. A 
lot of people who like it, cannot resist the cosy atmosphere of this 
interactive way of grilling.</p> <br>
<br>

<h6>Gas</h6> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>A gas barbecue reaches a temperature of between 200&deg; and&nbsp; 
250&deg;, which is perfect for preparations which require more time, such as 
grilling of chicken. Additionally. the heat of a gas barbecue is more humid and 
therefore ideal for fish.</strong><br>
 Also the gas barbecue has to pre-heat 
for about fifteen minutes in order to make the grill hot enough. In order to 
make the system as efficient as possible, the old models were supplied with 
lava stones. Nowadays lava stones have been replaced by plates which spread out 
the heat and produce a better result. Moreover, they are more hygienic than the 
porous lava stones.</p> 
<p> For gas barbecues you don't need to adjust the position of the grill, 
because the temperature is set with adjustable knobs.<br>
 Gas barbecues blaze 
less than charcoal barbecues because their temperatures are lower.</p>One of 
the big advantages is the type of combustion. Since the gas bottle has a big 
volume, the barbecue can be used for several times. After barbecuing it is 
advised to let the barbecue burn for fifteen minutes in order to clean the 
appliance.&nbsp; Also the lid, the bowl and the heat spreading plate need to be 
cleaned.
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h6>Electric barbecue</h6> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>An electric barbecue based on induction reaches a temperature 
of&nbsp; 200&deg;. Thanks to the technology the capacity lays seriously high 
and it is possible to grill thick meat rare and to get the meat warm also on 
the inside.</strong><br>
 Also the electric barbecue has to pre-heat. Thanks to 
induction this time is, however, considerably shortened. The efficiency with 
induction is four times higher than with the traditional electric barbecues.</p>
<p>Thanks to the higher efficiency and faster pre-heating, induction saves 
energy. Thanks to this energy saving technique, the temperature on the cooking 
surface is also much lower. This is not only a clear advantage in safety, but 
this property also reduces maintenance to a minimum.</p> 
<p> It is certain &nbsp;that cooking with induction is one of the most 
advanced cooking techniques and that even more and more professional cooks are 
opting for this technique, because of the fast reaction time and the accurate 
temperature regulation.</p> <br>
<br>

<h6>Cook Chips</h6> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Specially developed by barbecook&reg;, the Cook Chips are a unique and new 
energy source. Cook Chips are made of bamboo and therefore particularly 
environment-friendly. Their unique composition prevents formation of smoke 
during the grilling process! Cook Chips ensure evenly distributed and 
long-lasting heat. The surface temperature amounts to 500&deg;C, over which any 
dish can be prepared.</p> Barbecook&reg; developed the Cook Chips for the Amica 
table barbecue in particular. In this new form of party cooking everyone grills 
their own food around the authentic charcoal fire of the Amica. The Cook Chips 
&ndash; and the Amica &ndash; are lighted with barbecook&reg; lighting gel. 
After half an hour the Amica is ready for grilling, and the party can begin!
