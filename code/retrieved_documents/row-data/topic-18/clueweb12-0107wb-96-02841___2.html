 Perfect cover for the 
perfect grill<br>
 The cover fits perfectly! The best part is that it can go on 
right after I've grilled, no waiting for the grill to cool off. The vents built 
into the sides keep the condensation from building up.  Pros: Easy To Use, 
Great Design <br>

 Review 
of Aurora A660 Cover<br>
 Cover is very nicely crafted. Solid Seams with rubber 
coated hooks. When you spend the amount of $ on a Fire Magic Grill, to keep it 
clean and increase longevity is a no-brainer.  Pros: Easy To Clean, Easy To Use,
Keeps Grill Clean <br>
 Best Uses: Barbeque <br>

<br>  Fits Perfect! <br>
 This fits our grill perfectly and has another added 
bonus in that it has reduced the obssesion our two-year-old boys have with 
unscrewing the electric starter button.  Pros: Easy To Use <br>
 Best Uses: 
Barbeque <br>
