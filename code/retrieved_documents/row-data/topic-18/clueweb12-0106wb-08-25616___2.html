 Contemporary look <br>
 We 
bought this item as a center piece and table alternative around some wicker 
lounge chairs. We really like the size and look. The edge serves to hold the 
drinks or feet. It does clean really easy with a damp cloth and distributes 
some nice heat. However the only issue we have is the noise. Once it's running 
you can hear the hissing sound of the gas diverting throughout the rings. We 
even bought more lava rocks, but that didn't help. I was under the impression 
you can not hear the gas flow just like in a patio heater.  Pros: Durable, 
Attractive Design, Easy To Assemble, Easy To Clean, Easy To Use <br>
 Cons: 
makes noise <br>

Quick, Clean and good looking<br>
 Very nice size and price. It was very simple 
to set up and light. I used it with NG and got 1ft high flames with plenty of 
heat. The only thing that could make this offer better is if it came with your 
choice of tempered glass and a cover. The tempered glass option was a bit too 
costly, almost $900 for the lowest price glass, even so, the lava rocks 
included looks good and I'm very happy with this unit.  Pros: Attractive Design,
Easy To Assemble, Easy To Use <br>
 Cons: a pezo starter like the type on BBQs 
would be nice to have <br>

 By Cold at night in Seattle from Seattle, WA on 
09/15/2008 <br>
 Love it! <br>
 Just hooked it up for the first time. It's 
great! Very warm, but exterior doesn't get hot (I have babies). No smoke and 
even flame. Just the right size to have a group of people around it. Only 
issue, that I may be able to solve, is finding a way to keep it clean. 
Everything wants to stick to it (maybe I won't care soon). Slick design! I 
couldn't find anything this modern anywhere else - and I tried. [...]  Pros: 
Easy To Use, Very modern looking, Heat and ambience in one, Exterior doesn't 
get hot <br>
 Cons: Keeping clean <br>
 Best Uses: Patio <br>
