<p>The tradition&nbsp;of grilling has really been around since man discovered 
fire.&nbsp; However, over time it has gone from an essential cooking method to 
a weekend pass time and in current years it&rsquo;s even evolved into contests 
and cultured cuisine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the entire idea of cooking outdoors 
has progressed, so has the tradition within the United States.&nbsp; In a
Salon.com article on grilling it is said that George Washington recorded all of 
the barbecues he attended/hosted mentioning that he may have in fact been 
responsible for creating the &ldquo;first presidential barbecue.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
As time went on, grilling out seemed to regress back into the survival 
mentality with Food Network saying, &ldquo;Until well into the 1940s, grilling 
mostly happened at campsites and picnics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then in 1951, the world 
of grilling experienced a huge change, bringing barbecuing and grilling into 
virtually everyone&rsquo;s backyard.&nbsp; According to a piece of trivia in the
San Matteo Daily Journal, 1951 was the year that the first kettle-shaped 
barbecue grill was designed by George Stephen, a worker at Weber Brothers Metal 
Works near Chicago.&nbsp; Not only did this invention make is much easier and 
cheaper to grill on a more frequent basis, it also made way for grilled food to 
become a common entr&eacute;e at even the trendiest of restaurants today 
(including a chain of its own design,Weber Grill).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So with this rich (and tasty) history in mind, Central now shares with you 
our guide to summer grilling complete with mouth watering recipes that will get 
the word out that your restaurant has the best grill in town!</p> 
<h3>Prep/Safety:</h3>

<ul> 
<li>Temperature safety:</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&omicron; To prevent frivolous flipping and ensure cooking temperature use 
a&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
meat thermometer like thisDual-Sensing Probe<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thermometer/Timer and/or a grill thermometer.&nbsp; Eating&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undercooked 
meat could cause salmonella.</p> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&bull; It&rsquo;s also helpful to know the general rules on how hot to 
cook&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your 
food and how long on each side.&nbsp; Gohere for a nice guide.</p> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&omicron; 
After meat is cooked, do not leave it outside any longer than two&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
hours when the temperature is lower than 90&deg;F or one hour if the&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature 
is above 90&deg;F.</p> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;
<strong><em>*Tip*</em></strong> &ndash; Always pre-heat your grill (both 
charcoal and gas) to&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure 
that the temperature is stabilized so food is not&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cooked&nbsp;unevenly.&nbsp;
Whole Foods Market&rsquo;s Grilling Guide&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggests, 
lighting coals at least 30 minutes before beginning&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;cook 
on a charcoal grill and at least 15 minutes before on a&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gas 
grill.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not cook on outdoor grills indoors or under an awning:</li> </ul> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&omicron;&nbsp; 
If you would like to grill indoors, it is safe to use aCharbroiler&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
instead.&nbsp; Using an outdoor grill inside could cause a fire or&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even&nbsp;
Carbon Monoxide poisoning (when using charcoal).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always 
keep water, a fire extinguisher and aburn kit on hand&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;case 
a fire does break out.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be aware of cross-contamination:</li> </ul> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&omicron; 
Be prepared with two plates: one for raw meat and one for&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
cooked meat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&omicron; 
Keep fresh marinades and sauces on hand to use on cooked&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meats 
instead of using those that have been used with the raw&nbsp;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.
</p> 
<h3>Charcoal vs. Gas Grilling:</h3> 
<p>Photo from dixiegrilling.com</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>Convenience</em></strong> = Gas wins since it&rsquo;s as easy 
as turning the knob to get cooking.&nbsp; Charcoal involves a longer wait, 
stacking charcoal briquettes or lumps, lighter fluid levels, etc.&nbsp; 
Charcoal also requires a little more attention to make sure that the coals are 
staying hot while gas usually stays at a steadier temperature and can be 
regulated by a knob.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>Expense</em></strong> = Charcoal grills are usually less 
expensive initially, but do require new coals more often whereas a tank of 
propane can last for a while.&nbsp; However, with gas prices at +$4/gallon, 
charcoal may be the winner this summer.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>Cleanliness</em></strong> = Overall gas is a cleaner 
burn.&nbsp; It does not produce much in terms of air pollution due to smoke 
levels and there is less waste from the actual coals and fluid bottles.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>Taste</em></strong> = While it is a matter of opinion, there 
are definitely more options when it comes to a non-gas grill.&nbsp; In a 
charcoal grill, briquettes could be used or even different forms of wood chips 
to add a smokier flavor.&nbsp; But the only true difference is that a charcoal 
grill can reach a higher heat which creates a sort of crusting on the outside 
of the meat, sealing in flavor more easily. However, according to theAmazing 
Ribs site, &ldquo;If you use strong flavored rubs, marinades, and sauces, you 
will never notice taste differences because they hamper browning.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
So all in all it mostly comes down to personal preference.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong><em>Our suggestion to determine a winner</em></strong>:&nbsp; Try 
both of them out of course!&nbsp; For a gas version check out theBaker&rsquo;s 
Pride Outdoor Grills and for charcoal check out the Crown Veritay models.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>How to bring it all together:</h3> 
<p>Photo from ecx.images-amazon.com</p> 
<p>Once your grilled meal is all prepared, this final thing to always remember 
when grilling is the importance of a great presentation and marketing!&nbsp; 
&nbsp;While you&rsquo;re wonderful smelling/tasting barbecue may be enough to 
get most people in the door, invest in abarbecue sign to assure customers that 
yours really is the place to go for the best barbecue in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once 
guests are in the door,vinyl tablecloths lend a fun, picnic type vibe to the 
meal.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an extra added bonus they are also easy to clean with a 
damp cloth and are resistant to stains so guests can really dig in without any 
fear of ruining the table coverings.&nbsp; To add to the outdoor food vibe you 
can also serve up all of your delicious food in some rectangular plasticfood 
baskets, which are great for everything from barbecue to fries to just about 
any other side.&nbsp;&nbsp; While you&rsquo;re at it you might want to look 
into aniced tea brewer to make your guests some sweet tea to wash it all down 
with!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And although it&rsquo;s often overlooked, guests full 
on barbecue will appreciate you placing atoothpick dispenser out once plates 
have been cleared.</p>
