<h1>Types of Fireplaces</h1> 
<p><strong>What Is a Fireplace?</strong></p> 
<p>As its name implies, and at its most basic, a fireplace is simply &quot;a 
place for fire,&quot; literally. Left to its own devices, fire can be like a 
hungry, ravening beast devouring anything in its path that will burn, from a 
wisp of straw to an entire city. Afireplace can be indoors or outdoors, 
enclosed or open, simple or elaborate. But always the goal is to control the 
fire and to tame it to your purposes which is, most likely, to produce heat for 
warmth and perhaps cooking, and also to create an ambiance of cozy comfort.</p> 
<h2>Indoors</h2> 
<p><strong>Traditional Fireplaces</strong></p> 
<p>The most familiar type of indoor fireplace is the typical 
&quot;wall-mounted&quot; model found in dens, living rooms, even bedrooms 
(though in some structures, such as large contemporary homes and ski lodges, it 
may be free-standing and centrally located in the room, with openings on two or 
more sides). It may be made of brick, stone, cement, or ceramic, or some 
combination of these materials. The opening will usually be covered with a 
glass or metal screen of some sort. There will be afireplace grate for holding 
the wood off the ground.&nbsp;fireplaces of this type frequently are surrounded 
by an exterior mantle, which can be made of wood, marble, metal, brick, stone, 
or some other material. Mantle styles can range from simple to elegant to 
rococo to whimsical and, because of their prominence, often set the decorative 
tone for the entire room. Mostly they burn wood for fuel, but some can also 
burn coal, peat, and other materials. Almost always, the intent is to produce 
flame and heat for warmth; but bear in mind, most of the heat is going up the 
chimney, sofireplaces of this type are not particularly energy-efficient. With 
some kinds offireplaces, it is possible to use them for cooking, which actually 
was the norm right up until the 20th century.</p> 
<p>Old World fireplaces like this have been used for hundreds of years in the 
Americas, and in Europe since earliest Medieval times. However, in today's 
modern homes, which come equipped with a central furnace for heat, their appeal 
is mostly aesthetic and nostalgic (for looks) rather than practical (for 
warming a large living area). Some people like them just to look at and to fill 
up a blank space in a wall, but rarely use them because of the work involved in 
acquiring fuel and keeping them clean.</p> 
<p>However, if the work of gathering and splitting wood or cleaning out ash 
does not excite you, there is a nice alternative to consider: gas logs! These 
look incredibly realistic, and can even be operated by remote control. Gas log
fireplaces come in two varieties: vented and vent-free. Vented gas logs will 
need that chimney you may have decided you no longer want to use just make sure 
the chimney is free of creosote buildup and clear of obstructions such as 
bird's nests.</p> 
<p>While vented log sets give off a large flame, most of the heat is going up 
the chimney, as in the case of a woodburningfireplace. By contrast, vent-free 
gas logs lower heating costs in two ways: they require about half the fuel, and 
they operate with the damper closed. This means the heat is being sent into the 
room, not up the chimney. These logs can cost slightly more and produce smaller 
flames than vented units. When measuring the interior of yourfireplace for 
either one of these types of gas-logs, make sure you leave a minimum space of 3
<em>&quot;</em> on each side of the unit.</p>

<p>Some people love their fireplaces so much that they almost regret the 
arrival of summer. A relatively new product line that should appeal 
particularly to those individuals is the outdoorfireplace, which can be used 
for both atmosphere and heating/cooking in the spring, summer, and fall. These 
come in many shapes and sizes, all meeting different decorative and practical 
needs.</p> 
<p>The chiminea is basically a circular drum with a short chimney on top. 
Other models are called firepits and are simpler in design but still provide 
much enjoyment. With any of these units, consider the beauty and durability of 
copper it makes a huge difference. The heat provided by these units can make 
autumn evenings out of doors much more cozy and enjoyable.</p> 
<p>Similarly, patio heaters are stand-alone units with dome tops that radiate 
heat well in all directions, taking the chill out of spring and fall evenings 
if you sit close enough to them. Once again, these come in many different 
shapes, sizes, and price ranges, depending on how large an area you want to 
heat. Table-top models cost from $150 to $250, while larger units will set you 
back around $300 to $500.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Al Fresco</strong></p> 
<p>What's summer without a barbecue? Just as the hearth can be a wonderfully 
enjoyable focal point in the winter months, the grill area can be the social 
highlight in the months of June, July, and August. Needless to say, cooking 
outdoors is not only practical when the thermometer is pushing 90, it's also 
fun. But what kind of grill is right for you?</p> 
<p>Lets start off with the operation of the grill itself. What kind of fuel 
will you use, charcoal or gas? Both have their advantages and disadvantages. 
Propane is inexpensive, convenient, and safe as long as you take the right 
safety precautions. But the idea of having a large canister of compressed 
flammable gas on the premises makes some people nervous. Others may simply like 
the idea of using traditional charcoal for cooking.</p> 
<p>Which fuel you use is actually not too important. The most critical 
question is: how many people are you cooking for? In my own personal 
experience, many times I wish I owned a larger grill. When it comes to feeding 
even a moderate-sized crowd, bigger is better. A fancy gas unit with multiple 
burners is not only efficient it will really stick out at family gatherings!</p>
<p>Consider stainless steel when purchasing either type of grill (gas or 
charcoal). The black grills work fine but tend to get beat up pretty quickly, 
in my opinion. Remember, a typical backyard grill is constantly exposed to 
massive heat and extremes of weather. Once rust sets in, there's not much you 
can do to rescue a cheap grill. So a little extra money goes a long way toward 
ensuring quality and durability. Like so many other types of products, there 
are many choices. Just get the highest quality you can afford it will pay for 
itself many times over.</p> <br>
