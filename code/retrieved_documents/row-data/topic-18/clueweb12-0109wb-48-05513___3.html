a good amount of grill space. The charcoal heated quickly and provided the 
proper heat for grilling.  Pros: Cooks efficiently, Portable, Adds flavor to 
meal, Large grilling surface, Great for two people <br>
 Cons: None <br>
 Best 
Uses: Weekend cooking, For self/couple, Patio, Tailgating, Anytime, fireplace

 best grill I've owned <br>
 A big kettle grill 
is fine when you have a big party, but if you're just having a few friends over 
or grilling for a small family, this is the way to go. It heats evenly, cleans 
easily, and takes up hardly any space. Very sturdy - nothing cheap or flimsy 
about it - and it looks very classy. Because it's made of cast iron it's heavy 
(40 lbs), so while it's portable, it's not going to knock over.  Pros: Durable, 
Easy To Clean, Craftsmanship, Easy Assembly <br>
 Best Uses: For self/couple, 
Small Gatherings, Indirect Cooking, Great Searing <br>

 Fast, Powerful, Versatile Grilling <br>
 I am frequent 
griller (2-3 times a week) I have limited space for large charcoal or gas 
grill. This little powerhouse has been a god send, in addition to being ready 
to use, it adds great charcoal flavor provides adequate grill space for most 
any application, it's quick firing and easy to clean. Maintenance is important 
with this or any cast iron unit. No true hibachi has a lid but it would be nice 
to expand cooking versatility, for slower cooking. All-in-All a great little 
barbeque!  Pros: Cooks efficiently, Portable, Adds flavor to meal, Quick 
grilling <br>
 Best Uses: Patio, Tailgating, Anytime, Everyday, Camping <br>

 By Ranger Dan from

 High heat, table-top grilling <br>
 The Hibach 
grill must be used on a table top and is therefore messier than a stand-alone 
grill. However, it uses less fuel (real charcoal is best because it leaves less 
ash), starts quickly because the heat is contained, and its high heat is ideal 
for a perfect rare steak or seared hors d'oevres. The high heat also means 
cooking must be constantly monitored - not a problem at table top. It is 
solidly built which is a plus for table-top cooking and does not come with a 
cover because it is not appropriate for slow cooking.  Pros: Cooks efficiently, 
Adds flavor to meal, Quick grilling <br>
 Cons: Messy Cleanup <br>
 Best Uses: 
Patio, Anytime <br>

 Not bad... <br>

 We use this small Hibachi for heating saki or tea water out doors in our tea 
house, or for taking the chill off on a cool evening when we want to enjoy the 
stars, the small size is prefect for us.  Pros: Cooks efficiently <br>
