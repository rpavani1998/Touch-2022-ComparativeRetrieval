<h1>Charcoal vs. Gas: Outdoor Grills</h1> 
<h3>It's the most important feature in an outdoor kitchen, but before you go 
shopping for a grill make sure you've done your research.</h3> 
<ul>

<p>As the popularity of outdoor kitchens has grown in recent years 
manufacturers have introduced a manner of outdoor appliances, from wine 
refrigerators to built-in deep fryers. Chances are you just need a great grill.
</p> 
<p>Don't rush into buying a grill. It's the most important feature of your 
outdoor kitchen, and a good place to invest a big chunk of your budget. To 
decide which grill is right for you, keep these considerations in mind.</p> <br>
<h4>Gas or Charcoal?</h4> 
<p>Gas grills are convenient, they ignite at the push of a button and allow 
you to control the heat with the turn of a knob, but they're not ideal for true 
slow-cooked barbecue. Charcoal grills burn hotter than gas grills and you can 
burn wood in a charcoal grill, to impart a natural, smoky flavor to your foods. 
But it's harder to control the temperature, you have to stoke the fire 
constantly, and at the end of cooking you're left with a mess of ashes.</p> 
<p>So which type to choose? Maybe both: a gas grill for everyday grilling, and 
a charcoal model for more occasional barbecuing. Or if your budget is ample, 
look for a grill that offers both options in one unit. Electric grills are 
another choice, and may be the only option for apartment or condo dwellers, but 
they don't impart a real barbecue flavor.</p> <br>

delicious smoky aromas into foods for an authentic grill flavor. Photography

<h4>Gas Grills</h4> 
<p>Once you've settled on your grill, you'll have a few more decisions to make.
</p> 
<p><b>Materials</b> </p> 
<p>Most grills are made from cast aluminum, sheet metal, cast iron or 
stainless steel. Stainless steel is the best (and priciest) choice because it 
holds up well to the elements over time. It may be tempting to save some money 
by starting out with a less expensive grill that you can upgrade later, but 
that's not always a smart strategy, particularly if the grill is built-in.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's no standard grill size,&quot; says Mark Allen, president of 
the National Outdoor Kitchen and Fireplace Association. &quot;If your cheap 
grill doesn't last and you have to replace it, you'll probably have to redo the 
opening in the counter, which can be a big headache.&quot; Instead, he advises 
choosing a mid-range grill made of high-quality materials.</p> 
<p><b>Size</b> </p> 
<p>Gas grills are measured by the number of square inches of cooking surface 
they provide. Inexpensive grills start around 500 square inches, and a high-end 
gas grill may offer several times that capacity. Find the right size for your 
needs by evaluating your cooking habits. If you regularly cook for a crowd, you 
may want a large grill with multiple burners and a smaller surface with three 
burners is fine for meals for a family of four.</p> <br>

<h5>Get a Great Grill</h5> 
<p>Choose a mid-range grill made of high-quality materials, advises Mark 
Allen, president of the National Outdoor Kitchen and Fireplace Association.</p> 
<blockquote> Look for a grill that's made in the U.S. of 304 grade stainless 
steel, with a double-wall hood and heavy cast stainless-steel burners andgrates 
</blockquote> 
<p><b>Power</b> </p> 
<p>Grill power is measured in British Thermal Units (Btus). A small grill may 
have about 40,000 Btus or fewer, while a large grill may have as many as 
100,000 Btus of power. Look for grill power someplace in the middle.</p> 
<p><b>Accessories</b> </p> 
<p>As you might expect, the higher the price of the grill, the more bells and 
whistles&mdash;like side burners, infrared searing stations, rotisseries, 
dual-fuel functionality, and smoking compartments&mdash;it's likely to feature. 
Again, look to your habits to decide which features are worth your money.</p> 
<p>Generally speaking, it's smart to choose a grill with at least two 
separately controlled burners so you can grill foods indirectly (a technique 
often used for cooking larger items like whole chickens), a built-in 
temperature gauge, and a gas gauge, so you won't run out of propane mid-meal.
</p> <br>

<h4>Charcoal Grills</h4> 
<p>There are more types of charcoal grills than gas grills. You'll find kettle 
grills, built-in grills, table grills, hibachis, barrel smokers, water smokers 
and ceramic cookers, all of which use charcoal to grill or barbecue foods.</p> 
<p>The right one for you will depend on how you like to cook, but whichever 
charcoal grill suits your style, look for these signs of quality:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sturdy, high-grade steel construction</li> 
<li>A tightly fitting lid</li> 
<li>Baked-on porcelain enamel finish for a kettle grillHeat-resistant handles
</li> 
<li>Vents on the top and bottom for adjusting temperature</li> 
<li>A hinged cooking grate, which makes it easier to add coals to the fire</li>
</ul>
