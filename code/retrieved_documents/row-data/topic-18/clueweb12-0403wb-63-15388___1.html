 By ddeansr from 
wildomar, ca on 07/04/2011 <br>
 really surprised <br>
 To say I was surprised 
is an understatement, the quality of such a small grill was socking to say the 
least. For what I paid for this grill and the results achieved, I would 
strongly recommend this grill for any short on space and money, will look to up 
size to a larger grill when space permits  Pros: Cooks efficiently, Portable, 
Adds flavor to meal, Great for two people <br>
 Cons: None <br>
 Best Uses: For 
self/couple, Patio <br>
 Describe Yourself: Occasional griller <br>
