<h2><strong>Reviewers</strong></h2> 
<p>Many reviews are by Meathead, the author of most things on this website. In 
2012Max Good joined our staff as Director of Buyer's Guides and more and more 
of the reviews come from him. A few reviews have been contributed by Scot 
Murphy and Gordon Hubbell.</p> 
<h2><strong>Best In BBQ Medals</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Best In BBQ Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals are given only 
to products that we highly recommend based on price. Awards are based on 
features, quality, and value. Price is an important factor. Rarely will a $400 
Gold Medal be in the same league as an $800 Gold Medal, so it is important that 
you read the reviews. Rest assured that when we award a medal, it is because we 
are impressed by it for the price, not because someone has paid us to say so or 
because the company is an advertiser or sponsor.<strong>Manufacturers: </strong>

no charge) and for info on how to get a high resolution version.</p> 
<h2>About Model Numbers</h2> 
<p>Manufacturers often make slight variations to their basic model exclusively 
for certain merchants. For example, a grill manufacturer might make their 
Firebrand Grill Model ABC123 with cast iron grates available only on Amazon. 
Meanwhile, the ABC125 is identical except it has stainless steel grates, and it 
is sold only at ACE Hardware. Of course the prices can differ.</p> 
<h2><strong>Your Amazon Purchase Supports This Site</strong></h2> 
<p>When a product is available on Amazon.com, we often provide a direct link. 
Amazon often has the best prices anywhere, even better than many manufacturers' 
websites because manufacturers know that if they undercut retailers like 
Amazon, they may drop the products. Amazon also offers fast delivery (often 
free), no sales tax (in most states), gift wrapping (on many items), and 
painless refund policies. Check outAmazon's Gift &amp; Wish Registry.</p> 
<p><strong>IMPORTANT. </strong>Amazon pays AmazingRibs Inc. a small referral 
fee when you purchase from them after clicking on a link on this site, so 
purchasing from them helps underwrite the cost of operating AmazingRibs.com.</p>
<p>If you like all the info we give you for free and would like to help us 
stay free, please copy the link below and save it. It takes you to Amazon.com 
and tags things you buy with the AmazingRibs code so we get that referral fee.

<h2>Seasoning and calibrating your grill or smoker with dry runs</h2> 
<p>The first thing to do after you assemble your new grill or smoker is to 
season it and calibrate it by doing a few dry runs <em>without food</em>. This 
will burn off any manufacturer's grease, and give you a sense for how to set it 
up to hit the two important target temps that almost all my recipes use: 
225&deg;F and 325&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Of course, in order to do this, you <em>absolutely positively</em> must 
have a gooddigital oven thermometer. I don't care how much you spent on your 
grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and 
unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50&deg;F. Worse still, it is in 
the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. 
Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food.</p> <br>

<h2>Fireplace grill inserts</h2> 
<p>If you have a fireplace, you can use it for grilling all year round with 
the fireplace insert fromSpitjack.</p>

<h2>The most beautiful grills ever?</h2> 
<p>While wandering the side streets of Florence, Italy, in fall 2008, I 
stumbled acrossGiotti Ceramiche, a store selling beautiful ceramics, among them 
were several magnificent ceramic grills. These may be the most beautiful grills 
I've ever seen. They ship to the US.</p> <br>

<h1>Reviews of Charcoal Grills</h1> 
<p>There are scores of charcoal grills on the market, and some manufacturers 
tweak their designs every year or two, so there's no way I can review them all. 
Below we have tried to discuss what we consider the most important models.</p> 
<p>Before you make up your mind, make sure to read these articles:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>How to Buy a Grill</li> 
<li>Thermodynamics of Cooking</li> 
<li>2-Zone and Indirect Cooking</li> 
<li>Charcoal Grills vs. Gas Grills.</li> 
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You should also check out my reviews of 
Charcoal Smokers because many of them are also good at grilling.</li> </ul> 
<p>When I look at a charcoal grill, in addition to the features discussed in 
How to Buy a Grill, the most important features are:</p> 
<p><strong>Temperature control.</strong> You cannot be a good cook unless you 
know your oven temp and can control it. Indoors, your oven can be set for a 
temp and it will stay pretty close to it. Outdoors? Good luck! Temperature 
control on charcoal grills depends on: A lid, dampers, and the ability to 
adjust the distance between the coals and the food.</p> 
<p><em>Lid. </em>You must have a lid to capture heat, and the tighter it fits, 
the better.</p> 
<p><em>Dampers. </em>Most charcoal grills have at least two dampers, one at 
the bottom and one on the top. You control the temperature with the bottom 
damper. That's how the oxygen gets in. Make sure the damper fits tightly so you 
can accurately choke off oxygen when you want to lower the temp. Most of the 
time you will leave the top damper wide open so smoke and gases can exhaust. 
Closing the exhaust damper can cause creosote to form on the food and that 
gives it a bitter taste. I close it only to extinguish the coals after the food 
is off.</p> 
<p><em>Adjustable. </em>The other way to control temp is by raising and 
lowering the charcoal. Temperature drops off rapidly as the coals drop down. I 
love to start cooking burgers and many other meats on a low temperature and 
then at the end, raise the coals and sear the surface to create the deep 
complex flavors that occur with the Maillard effect and caramelization.</p> 
<p><strong>2-Zone or Indirect cooking capability.</strong> One of the most 
important techniques an outdoor cook must learn is how to set up and use a
2-Zone or Indirect cooking environment. This allows you to move the food off 
the flame into a cooler area where it roasts from convection and indirect heat. 
To do this you need to be able to push the coals to one side. So a good grill 
must have space to move the coals to one side.</p> 
<p><strong>Access to charcoal</strong>. It is important to be able to easily 
add more charcoal or move the charcoal around without removing the food or 
opening the lid and losing heat. Some grills have a door that allows you to add 
charcoal or move it around. This is a very nice idea for helping you keep temp 
under control.</p> 
<p><strong>Ash removal.</strong> It is nice to have a good ash removal system. 
Ash is a fine insulator, so if you don't remove it, it will absorb heat and 
reduce performance.</p> 
<p><strong>Thermometer.</strong> A rule of thumb: The dial thermometers in 
grills are worthless and can be off as much as 50&deg;F. To make matters worse, 
they are usually located in the lid, well above the food. To have any chance of 
cooking great food you must geta good thermometer.</p> 
<p><strong>Other factors.</strong> Beyond these factors, a good charcoal grill 
must have the same assets as any other grill, including solid construction, 
etc., as discussed in my articleHow to Buy a Grill. </p> 
<h1>Below I have listed several popular or noteworthy grills alphabetically. 
Click the red links for current pricing and more info.</h1> 
<h2><strong>Brinkmann Charcoal Grills</strong></h2> 
<p>Brinkmann is a puzzlement. They market a wide range of cooking tools, some 
of which are among the best in their category, and some among the worst. In 
general they are inexpensive, clever designs, but not built to last. Brinkmann 
makes several cheap round grills. These grills are hard to make good food with 
and it is hard to review them and find much nice to say.<em> - Meathead</em></p>
<h2><strong>Brinkmann Single Zone Charcoal Grill</strong></h2> 
<p>Home Depot is offering the Brinkmann Single Zone Charcoal Grill that, it 
seems, you can only get from their stores. My local Depot is selling it for 
$199. Standing nearly four feet tall and a little over five feet wide, 
it&rsquo;s powder black, features 2 side tables, has 576 square inches of main 
cooking surface and 202 on the warming rack. That's enough main grill space for 
a large family dinner. It has some other good features: There are nice 
porcelain-coated cast-iron cooking grates, and the warming rack is 
porcelain-coated wire. There&rsquo;s a cranking adjustable charcoal grate that 
is accessed through a front door. Crank adjustable charcoal racks mean better 
heat control and we are fond of them. Underneath is a storage cabinet, and 
inside it an ash catcher. Large vents are in the back of the lid, and a vent on 
each side has a front-facing slide with plastic knob. There's a temperature 
gauge that you can ignore. Please get your own, more accurate, digital grill 
thermometer. </p> 
<p>People who've bought it seem to like it, especially the large cooking 
space. It gets merits for being easy to build, but the common complaint is that 
there are too many air gaps, or pieces being slightly bent before assembly. The 
ash catcher might be a little difficult, being recessed into the cabinet, but 
shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem. The cover for it is extra, but you really 
should buy it: this isn&rsquo;t tough enough to stand up to years of weather.
<em> - Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Brinkmann Dual Function Gas and Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>When you see the Brinkmann Dual Function Gas and Charcoal Grill at Home 
Depot (we think it is available only there), you'll be tempted. It looks pretty 
and promises a lot. There's a three-burner propane gas grill on the left and a 
charcoal grill on the right, with 403 square inches primary cooking surface and 
185 square inches on the warming rack of each barrel. That gives it the sort of 
cooking space you'll need for a big backyard party.</p> 
<p>The three burners within are 12,000 BTU each, and it has a side shelf with 
an embedded 12,000 BTU burner. The grates are porcelain-coated cast iron and 
each lid has a so-called &quot;thermometer&quot;. You&rsquo;re already dreaming 
of getting the steaks done on gas with a quick trip over to the charcoal side 
to sear them, arfen't you? It&rsquo;s only $299, and that means it&rsquo;s a 
good buy. Right?</p> 
<p>Not really. It has problems. The metal is thin and not well-fitted. The 
thermometers are useless, and only have 100 degree grades. As always, bring 
your own,more accurate digital grill thermometer. The vents on the charcoal 
side are spring-loaded to hold them closed and the vents on the floor is huge, 
so you're going to be fighting to maintain an even temp all through the cook. 
The charcoal grates are adjustable with clumsy pull-up handles. The warming 
racks are plated wire and protrude out over the left shelf, a shelf which is 
too small and flimsy for anything other than warming your (small) pot of 
homemade BBQ sauce. The gas ignition is piezoelectric. The handles are plastic. 
According to one owner, &quot;sometimes grease gathers on the bottom sides and 
leaks through the grill. The grease trap in the middle fills up quick too... 
There is no shelf on the bottom to put an extra drip pan or your cooking 
tools.&quot;</p> 
<p>At $299, this is overpriced. Using the Weber Equivalency, you could get 
three One-Touch Silvers and not only have almost 1200 total square inches 
cooking, you'll have three sturdier grills with better air control that will 
last a lot longer with less care. The Brinkmann Dual Gas and Charcoal Grill 
will impress you in the store when you see it, but don&rsquo;t be tempted.<em>-

<h2><strong>Cajun Grills</strong></h2> 
<p>There are three sizes of this heavy duty unit, 468 square inches of cooking 
surface, 714&quot;, and 1656&quot;. It can grill, and, because it is long and 
narrow, it can be easily set up for indirect cooking and smoke roasting. It has 
a V shaped trough in which the charcoal grate sits. The charcoal can be raised 
and lowered, but because of the V shape, the charcoal grate is narrower than 
the cooking grate, so much of the surface doesn't have coals beneath it, making 
for a big time hot spot in the center.</p> 
<p>Also, there's no way to add charcoal without removing the food. There is a 
removable ash pan and two adjustable air intakes in the base on either side but 
no chimney. The smoke exits from under the lid. The grate is porcelain coated, 
something I like. You can order an optional water pan, rotisserie, and 
thermometer. Comes with a 5 year, warranty from defects in workmanship and 
materials. The coal tray has a 10 year warranty. Click here for more info and 
pricing:<strong>Cajun Grills</strong>.<em> - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Cajun Microwave</h2> 
<p>First of all, rest assured, there are no microwaves used in this beauty. 
The originals were home made wooden boxes for a splayed open pig. A sheet of 
metal was placed on top of the pig and coals poured on top of the metal. Al 
Simon's Cajon Microwaves (he pronounces it with a bayou twang<em>SEE moan</em>) 
are beautifully made of stainless steel and trimmed with gorgeous Louisiana 
Cypress.</p> 
<p>They come in four sizes. There are two RV units, 14&quot; x 14&quot; x 
14&quot; to take to the LSU games and big enough for a pork butt, beef roast, 
or several chickens. The Small is 18&quot; x 18&quot; x 14&quot; deep. The 
medium is 18&quot; wide x 34&quot; long x 14&quot; deep and will hold a small 
hog. The Large is 22&quot; wide x 46&quot; long x 14&quot; deep, and can hold a 
whole Arkansas Razorback.</p> 
<p>The improvements Al has made over the original are substantial. There is a 
large stainless steel box wrapped with insulation and boxed in with cyprus. You 
can even have the wood laser etched with your team logo, company logo, wife's 
picture, whatever. To cook, you place the food in square stainless steel pots 
that are lowered into the box, and then there is a stainless tray that holds 
the coal that goes on top of the pots of food. That's right, the heat radiates
<em>down</em> from the coals into the enclosed box. It's like a giant Dutch 
oven designed to produce tender and juicy food.</p> 
<p>Each unit comes with a DVD with video instructions and recipes. They offer 
a chicken pot that is a clever improvement on the beercan chicken concept, a 
turkey pot, a side shelf, a grill that can be placed on top of the coals, or a 
solid griddle with a grease trap, a rotisserie, a firepit attachment, and it 
can even be converted into an ice chest. Click here for more info and pricing:

<h2><strong>Char-Broil CB940X</strong></h2> 
<p>Char-Broil make several charcoal grills in a range of sizes, prices, and 
qualities. My favorite is the<strong>Char-Broil CB940X</strong> (right). I has 
a nice large 540 square inch cooking surface with pre-seasoned cast iron 
cooking grates, adjustable height charcoal grate, a front door for easy fire 
tending, two adjustable dampers, removable ash tray, and two handy removable 
wooden side boards that double as carving and serving boards. At this time it 
is available only on theChar-Broil website.<em> - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Char-Broil Santa Fe</h2> 
<p>The cheaper <strong>Char-Broil Santa Fe</strong> is similar in concept, but 
not in execution. Made of painted steel, it feels flimsy. It has 491 square 
inches cooking surface with porcelain coated grates, and side shelves. The 
Santa Fe is in wide distribution. Click here for more info and pricing:<strong>
Char-Broil.</strong><em> - Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Char-Broil American Gourmet</h2> 
<p>The Char-Broil American Gourmet is an entry-level barrel shaped charcoal 
grill. With an optional offset firebox. There are three models/sizes: 300, 600, 
and 800. They are all barrel shaped, painted steel, with a side shelf and a 
removable ash pan. The 600 and 800 also feature a folding front shelf (a plus 
if you&rsquo;re like me and have the BBQ Belly) and a swing-away secondary 
cooking shelf (essentially, a warming rack). The 300 has 225 square inches of 
cooking area, which works for the small apartment patio or balcony. The 600 has 
435 square inches primary cooking and 188 inches on the secondary shelf, and 
the 800 has 580 square inches primary and 270 square inches secondary.</p> 
<p>Temperature control can be a problem because the metal is thin and 
doesn&rsquo;t insulate well, and the lid doesn&rsquo;t fit tightly. They all 
come with what the parts list calls a &quot;heat indicator,&quot; and it may 
only be useful enough to indicate that there is heat inside. As usual, we 
strongly recommend that you get aquality digital oven thermometer. I am told 
they are easy to assemble, making grilling the same day you buy it a breeze. 
But so is theWeber Kettle (described below) at about the same price as the 300, 
and it has a tight fitting lid, something we think is important for a grill.</p>
<p>If you are considering buying this and the offset firebox for use as a 
smoker, please read the article on offset smokers here.</p> 
<p>The American Gourmet series is also a good choice if your budget is really 
tight, or if you are a tinkerer who wants to spend time modifying it to make it 
perform better. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to last very long unless you take 
good care of it. Using it one year will probably give you to the dread upgrade 
virus, anyway!<em>- Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Char-Griller 5050 Duo Gas-and-Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>This is a great concept, a capacious gas and charcoal grill in one unit, 
and you can add an optional offset charcoal firebox to make it a smoker, too. 
Unfortunately the quality is reflected in their price. Cheap.</p> 
<p>The gas side on the left produces 40,800 BTU with 3 burners. A side burner 
puts out 12,000 BTUs. There is no natural gas optional hookup. The barrel on 
the right is a charcoal grill, and it boasts 876 square inches in the 
&quot;main grill area&quot; and a total of 1,260 including the upper rack. It 
has an adjustable charcoal grate, though it&rsquo;s not well-designed: the 
grate, which is of narrow-gauge steel, has a handle on left and right that is 
connected by eye-hooks. That means that when you raise or lower it, it can 
swing left and right; it also means that to do that, you have to lean over the 
grill somewhat.</p> 
<p>There is an electronic 3-in-one starter, porcelain-enameled cast iron 
grates, a 5-year burner warranty, and a 1-year warranty on all other parts. On 
the left of the grill is a shelf with a trap door, under which is the 
electronic ignition for the gas grill. The shelf converts into a side gas 
burner, too. It has hooks for utensils on the side shelf, which is handy, but 
they're a little low for me.</p> 
<p>But the metal is thin, the lids don&rsquo;t seal, the thermometers are 
cheap and useless, some handles are plastic, the side shelves are small, and 
the warming racks can't be removed. One buyer on Amazon wrote &quot;When the 
lids are open, the warming racks go up/back right over the lid. Anything that 
drips off the warming rack goes right down the lid and onto the ground behind 
the grill. I found this out the hard way after an afternoon of cooking burgers. 
What a mess! There are no bumpers around the grilling perimeter. One bad 
spatula or tong move and your meat will slide right off in any direction! They 
should have at least put a bumper in the back. The joints aren't tight. Any 
grease that drips down on the propane side in the corners between the bottom 
and side pieces of the grill goes right between the two pieces of metal and 
drips on the propane tank.&quot; There are complaints about the grates 
themselves: it&rsquo;s been reported that the porcelain coating pops off. 
Char-Griller replaced the gates in that case.</p> 
<p>The price is right for do-it-yourselfers who like to modify their cookers. 
One popular mod is to use the charcoal tray from the optional firebox as a heat 
diffuser on the left gas grill, where some have used other means such as a 
soapstone slab or &ldquo;tuning plates&rdquo; that can be moved from right to 
left a couple inches each to distribute the heat more toward one area or 
another. Some people have inserted gaskets to improve the seals to produce more 
even airflow, or have added a metal duct hose inside to bring the exhaust pipe 
closer to the grates, important on a windy day when it would ordinarily lose a 
lot of heat. Others have put water heater blankets on them for insulation, 
which is not expensive.</p> 
<p>For the tinker with a tight budget, the Char-Griller Duo can be a bounty of 
weekend projects. But for the cook who strives for great outdoor meals, it 
leaves a lot to be desired. -<em>Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Emeril by Viking Culinary 24-Inch Outdoor Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>It had to happen. The first celebrity-named grill. No, the George Foreman 
electric pseudo-grill does<em>not</em> count. New in 2011 is the Chef Emeril 
Lagasse-badged grill which is clearly aimed at competing with the ubiquitous, 
but aging Weber kettle design. There don't seem to be any brick &amp; mortar 
stores carrying the Emeril yet, so we have had to gather our info on the 
internet.</p> 
<p>Clearly positioned to compete with the Weber One-Touch Gold, this new 
design one-ups the competition with several improvements. The looks are 
certainly more contemporary: A porcelain-coated metallic-gray fire box, a 
powder-coated &quot;heavy gauge&quot; steel lid, and four fat tubular legs as 
opposed to the Weber's three legs. Its 24&quot; diameter grate with 424 square 
inches of primary cooking area is larger than the Weber's 397 square inches. 
The grate is made of electroplated steel wire, which likely means it is nickel 
coated. That's how most low-cost small grill grates, including the Weber's, are 
plated.</p> 
<p>The standard grate is hinged in the center for adding more coals, a big 
plus and an extra cost option on the Weber. The lid is hinged, so you don't 
have to put it on the ground and trip on it as with the Weber. At the base of 
the four legs is a wire shelf, a good place to stow your bag of charcoal. The 
wire shelf on the Weber base is not very useful. The ash removal system looks 
pretty easy. The handle you use to move it doubles as a towel rack. It also 
features the obligatory hood temperature indicator, which measures the air next 
to the thermometer, not on the grill. As always we suggest yousupply your own 
digital grill thermometer.</p> 
<p>The prices on the internet are about $200, about $50 more than the Weber 
One-Touch Gold and about $100 less than the Weber Performer, which has a work 
table, charcoal storage bin, and gas ignition. Of the four reviews we found by 
owners, one had problems with it and returned it, and two mentioned that it 
needs a large, oblong cover for its odd proportions. One reviewer accidentally 
pointed out how tight the seal is when the lid is closed: when opening the lid, 
the reviewer got a fireball that &quot;singed the hairs on my arms&quot;. 
That's what happens when a smoldering fire, starved of oxygen, suddenly gets a 
rush of it. While I'm guessing that owner had his vents closed shut, it&rsquo;s 
still a good indication that the seal on the closed lid is nice and tight, good 
for cooking, bad for arm hair. The upper damper, a dial-type with 6 apertures, 
is not on the top of the lid, as you'd expect, but on the left side. This helps 
the user control air and smoke flow somewhat.</p> 
<p>Viking has a brand name cachet, but not in barbecue and smoker equipment, 
where their expensive smoker has been heavily criticized. But this looks like a 
winner. It has a good warranty: 2 years on the cooking grate, 5 years on the 
steel parts, and 5 years on all the plastic handles and parts. The painted 
surfaces carry a 90-day warranty. Made in China.<em> - Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Fire Magic</strong></h2> 
<p>Talk about objects of lust! Fire Magic is the manufacturer of some of the 
most beautiful and expensive patio cooking equipment out there. They make two 
sizes of all stainless steel charcoal grills starting with the Custom I with 18 
x 24&quot; (432 square inches) cooking surface and a removable warming rack 
above the cooking surface. The Regal I has a 18 x 30&quot; (540 square inches) 
cooking surface. Both come with standard roll-top lids, or an optional 
&quot;smoker hood&quot;.</p> 
<p>They have a front door for loading charcoal into the &quot;unique Air-Flow 
charcoal pan&quot;, and a crank that allows you to raise and lower the 
charcoal. This important feature lets you move the heat right below steaks that 
you wish to sear with high heat or drop it down for low and slow cooking things 
like ribs. The ash pan is easy to remove but does not have much capacity. All 
models and sizes are available as cart mounted stand-alone or they can be built 
into a counter. Also available is a nifty cradle rotisserie that encloses your 
food in a basket rather than placing it on an unbalanced skewer or piercing it 
with a heat conducting skewer. -<em>Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Hasty-Bake Gourmet Grill/Smoker/Oven</strong></h2> 
<p>Bottom line: I have never worked with a finer charcoal grill. They may be 
out there, but I've never encountered them.</p> 
<p>Please do not confuse this superb cooker with the Easy-Bake Oven toy for 
kids! This is a real grownup serious charcoal cooker. There is nothing you 
can't do with this grill and it deserves a place in the back yard of every 
serious outdoor cook. A friend calls it the Swiss Army knife of grills.</p> 
<p>Founded in Tulsa, OK, by Grant &quot;Hasty&quot; Hastings in 1948, 15 years 
before the unfortunately named kids' toy and three years before the Weber 
Kettle were invented, the Hasty-Bake was probably the first home grill with a 
hood, and it incorporated innovations that are just being rediscovered by other 
grill makers today.</p> 
<p>The manufacturers sent me their top of the line, the Gourmet model (shown 
at right), to test in July 2010. It has 522.5 square inches of main grate 
cooking surface, and 283.5 square inches on an upper grate. My favorite feature 
is the adjustable height charcoal grate (#1 in the illustration below). It 
moves up and down with a crank allowing me to lower the coal grate, push the 
coals to the right side, fire them up, start a big hunk of beef like arib roast 
on the left side of the food grate, then, when I get the meat's interior temp 
to say 115&deg;F, I can slide it over the coals, crank them up to right below 
the meat, and brown the exterior as the interior rises to 125&deg;F. This lets 
it work like a Santa Maria grill, perfect forTri-Tip, or a closed convection 
roaster perfect for turkey or chicken. It is very easy to set up for2-Zone or 
Indirect cooking and smoke roasting or you can just crank it all the way up to 
sear a steak in a hurry. Remember the heat diminishes rapidly the further the 
food is from the coals.This system gives you very good temp control.</p> 
<p>There's a large, easy to remove, ash pan for rapid cleanup, a large side 
door (3) that allows you access to the charcoal during the cook, a removable 
heat deflector (5) that goes between the coals and the cooking grates for 
better indirect cooking, a removable stainless steel work table that runs the 
full length of the front, and vents down low on the sides (3), not on the hood. 
The cooking grates (4) are angled towards the center, and a V-shaped channel 
(2) ducts much of the grease to a disposable cup on the outside. The Gourmet 
model has an upper rack for cooking or keeping food warm, and a glass window so 
you can see your food without lifting the bi-fold door on the fixed hood.</p> 
<p>In addition to fine searing and indirect convection cooking, the Hasty-Bake 
is a good smoker. It does a fine job of circulating smoke. In fact, it is 
almost too good. You will need much less wood than you think and if you don't 
cut back, you could easily oversmoke. Yes, it does leak a lot of smoke, but it 
also retains and circulates a lot, so you need very little wood.</p> 
<p>So far my only criticisms are relatively minor. I have had problems getting 
it down under 250&deg;F to 225&deg;F my favorite smoke roasting temp, but with 
practice and precise measuring of coals, it can be done. As with every grill 
that uses a bimetal thermometer, this one is wildly inaccurate according to 
benchmark tests I have done with a thermocouple. So make sure you get agood 
digital grill thermometer to get the most out of this otherwise fine cooker. 
Also, the bi-fold door on the Gourmet will knock plates and wine glasses off 
the front shelf if you're not careful opening and closing it. Maybe this is 
just a personal problem?</p> 
<p>You will need the optional cover because rain can get in, and you should 
also get heavy duty gloves because the knob on the side door gets hot. The best 
way to light the coals is with the charcoal tray and the ash tray sticking out 
the side door, and you will need gloves or a stick to push it back into 
position. You will not need a chimney to start coals. You can mound the coals 
in the charcoal tray and ignite them from below.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, fit and finish are very good on the Gourmet. I have not tested 
the others, so I cannot speak for them. All models have a 5 year warranty on 
workmanship and parts, a 1 year warranty on finish, and a 10 year warranty on 
stainless steel components. Some models are available in all stainless, and 
some are both stainless and black powder coated. A rotisserie is available, 
and, get this, the Gourmet can run two rotisseries at once! Click here for more 
info and pricing:Hasty Bake. - <em>Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Hasty Bake Continental</h2> 
<p>This is a smaller version of the Gourmet (above). There are 289 square 
inches of primary cooking area and an upper grate that adds another 215 square 
inches. Overall dimensions are 23&quot; wide x 16&quot; deep x 43&quot; high 
and weighs 110 pounds. The base is sturdy 20 gauge powder-coated steel, and the 
galvanized lift and fire box are 18 and 12 gauge. The manufacturer includes a 
generous 10 year warranty on parts and workmanship. -<em>Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Kingsford Grills</h2> 
<p>Kingsford is a trusted brand for charcoal, so it is natural that they would 
want to get mileage out of it by attaching it to charcoal grills, even if they 
don't build them.</p> 
<h2>Kingsford Charcoal Wagon Grill</h2> 
<p>Guess what, Virginia: Sometimes, great bargains do exist. The Charcoal 
Wagon Grill (model #BB02231G), a Wal-Mart exclusive, is good bang for your 
buck. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to spend less than $100 and get a grill with 
381 square inches of cooking space and a 202 square inch warming rack. That's 
large enough to push the coals to one side and cook indirect on the other. 
There's a crank-adjustable charcoal grate that brings it about an inch or two 
under the cooking grate, a foldable shelf with utensil hooks, a front charcoal 
door, an easy-to-remove ash pan, and even a bottle opener. The cooking grate is 
porcelain-coated wire. It has the obligatory built-in thermometer that 
doesn&rsquo;t work well, too. As we suggest often, use your own, moreaccurate 
digital grill thermometer. Throw in a two-year warranty on manufacturer&rsquo;s 
defects for all parts, and you have a bargain.</p> 
<p>Better still, it&rsquo;s solid. The metal is a little thin, but not any 
thinner than some of its big brothers. It&rsquo;s well designed for airflow, 
having vents on the left and right of the charcoal chamber as well as on the 
hood. Put together properly, you shouldn&rsquo;t have any stray drafts playing 
havoc with temperatures. Yet it&rsquo;s not a beast, weighing in at only 67.3 
pounds. It&rsquo;s easy to move because there&rsquo;s no flex or wobble to it. 
It&rsquo;s compact. The side shelf is held sturdily with thick screws. In a 
nice touch, the handles are shiny steel. One part you can do without is the 
glue-on rubber feet for the lid: it makes a non-sealing lid worse. It uses a 
60&quot; grill cover, highly recommended.</p> 
<p>All it needs for assembly is a flathead screwdriver, a Phillips 
screwdriver, and an adjustable wrench. Wal-Mart will even assemble it for you; 
contact your local one for details. Owners have given it high marks. While they 
report assembly times of 2 to 3 hours as compared to the manufacturer&rsquo;s 
estimate of one hour, they rate it highly for being easy to clean, for the 
adjustable charcoal grate, and for the spacious cooking surface. One owner 
reported paint melting off, and one wished it sealed well enough to extinguish 
the coals when closed. Most were very happy with it. Well taken care of, this 
cooker could last years. -<em>Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Kingsford Premium Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>Made by Master-Built the Kingsford Premium Charcoal Grill (model 
#GR1008-015054), a big, attractive hunk of spacious grilling. For less than 
$200, it offers a large 773 total square inches of cooking between the heavy, 
porcelain-coated cast iron grates and the upper warming rack, two folding side 
shelves, utensil hooks, crank-adjusting dual charcoal grates, a removable ash 
pan, and locking casters. There are two storage sections, a tilt-out charcoal 
bin on the left and storage on the right, and the obligatory built-in 
thermometer (as always, we recommend you get anaccurate digital grill 
thermometer). It weighs in at 61 pounds and comes with a 2-year defects 
warranty. Dial vents are on both left and right and on both the base and the 
lid. There&rsquo;s no smokestack. The doors and handles are of shining steel 
that, if you care about such things, you may find yourself forever keeping 
clean.</p> 
<p>This one is a mixed bag. It does have great features. The dual charcoal 
grates let you cook at different temps, which can be a great plus, though we'd 
like to see the coals get just a little higher. Each side has its own charcoal 
door, but they&rsquo;re both smaller than we'd like for easy access. The 
metal&rsquo;s pretty thin, and the charcoal bin is even thinner and flimsier. 
The cooking grates are solid and heat-holding, and the seals, while not 
airtight, aren&rsquo;t so loose that you&rsquo;ll lose noticeable heat. The 
ashpan is also flimsier than on the Charcoal Wagon Grill, making for potential 
messes. On the whole, it looks very attractive, but the feel of it is 
underwhelming. Combining this sort of cooking space with the materials and 
workmanship to make it inexpensive results in compromises, which is what the 
Premium Charcoal Grill feels like: a compromise.<em> - Scot Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Kingsford Rectangle Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>Kingsford has also put its badge on the 23 inch Rectangle Charcoal Grill 
(model #CBC1132W). Like many others, it&rsquo;s a competitor to the Weber 
One-Touch line. This one has 406 square inches of cooking area with a 190 
square inch warming rack, a folding side shelf, utensil hooks, an adjustable 
charcoal grate, a porcelain-coated wire cooking grate, and it comes with a 
2-year defects warranty. This package is currently well under $100, and 
Wal-Mart says that they will assemble them for free, though that varies from 
store to store.</p> 
<p>This grill is no bargain. You&rsquo;d do better to pay a few bucks more for 
the Charcoal Wagon Grill. The metal is flimsier than a Weber. The side shelf 
won&rsquo;t hold much weight, and the utensil hooks are molded plastic that 
look like the won&rsquo;t accommodate many utensils. The charcoal grate is 
raised by a wide knob that you turn like a dial, rather than by simple levers. 
Getting it to move evenly is difficult. The ash pan is rickety. The legs are 
lightweight and easily bent, and the bottom rack is useless. We don't think it 
will last, and we think it is overpriced. Leave this one alone.<em> - Scot 
Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Landmann Black Dog 28</h2> 
<p>Landmann USA manufactures a variety of fire-related products, including 
outdoor fireplaces, grills, and smokers. Its Black Dog 28 charcoal grill looks 
like a sturdy contender for your backyard needs. It features a spacious 506 
square inches of cooking area. The steel base and frame range from 0.08 to 1.0 
mm thick and the lid is 1.2 mm thick. The clearance between cooking surface and 
lid is 19 inches, meaning you should have no problems putting your turkey in 
easily, and the charcoal grate can be cranked up and down 12&quot; giving you 
good temperature control. There are big front doors for adding charcoal, a 
large easy to remove ash pan, vents for air exhaust but not for air intake, and 
one side shelf. The grates are porcelain coated, which is very nice, but it has 
two built-in thermometers that aren't actually close to the cooking action. 
Much better that you use your own meat thermometer and oven thermometer. -<em>

<h2>Meadow Creek Grills, Smokers, &amp; Grill/Smokers</h2> 
<p>It is a real treat in a disposable world to see products this well built. 
Especially at these prices.</p> 
<p>All Meadow Creek grills, smokers, and grill/smoker combos are made by Amish 
craftsmen in New Holland, PA, as they have been since the company was founded 
in 1980. As you might expect, their designs are simple, well thought out, their 
build is solid and the products are long lasting. Most metal is seriously heavy 
13 gauge steel, grates are 304 stainless steel expanded metal mesh, and handles 
are stainless steel coils that never get too hot and are easy on the hands. 
Meadow Creeks are favorites among the competition crowd for quality as well as 
price. That metal will stand up to nature's fury, and as long as you have them 
covered and keep them clean, you should be handing these down to your kids. If 
they've been good.</p> 
<p>Below we discuss their backyard and tailgate grills, smokers, and 
grill/smoker combos. Onour page about big rigs we discuss their TS tank smoker 
series, which includes one suitable for the backyard cook.</p> 
<h2>The Pig Roaster Series</h2> 
<h3>PR36</h3> 
<p>Although it can handle a small hog, Meadow Creek's PR36 does much more. 
This is one versatile cooker. There is a deep trough and a tall lid with a sold 
strong hinge. A tray for charcoal hangs inside the trough 6&quot; below the 
grate. Load it up any you can bring coal very close to the food for a quick hot 
sear. Or, if you wish, coals can be placed right on the bottom of the trough. 
You can then place the empty coal tray above coals for indirect cooking, or 
even fill the tray with water for steaming. Push the coals to one side and you 
have a fine 2-zone setup and put wood on the coals and you can smoke as well as 
any offset smoker. The coal tray lifts out easily so ash disposal is a snap.</p>
<p>There is an inverted V shape bar that runs the length of the bottom of the 
coal tray and it has large holes in it. It can be used to divide the charcoal 
bed and improve airflow to the embers. One can even lay unlit coals in a C or U 
shape and put hot coals on one end and it will burn slowly around the bend like 
a fuse, ideal for low and slow cooking.</p> 
<p>The cooking grate is 15 x 35&quot; for a whopping 525 square inches of 
primary cooking surface. It comes with a duplicate second grate that can be 
placed above the main grate, doubling you cooking capacity.</p> 
<p>There are six simple flap covered vent holes, two on each side of the 
bottom, and one on each side of the lid. They don't seal perfectly nor does the 
lid, but a perfect seal is overrated. Temp control and airflow are more 
important. The large inflatable tires make it fairly easy to roll it on uneven 
surfaces such as grass, dirt, and even sand. It is painted with heat resistant 
black enamel. Powder coated would have been better. The seriously large dial 
thermometer in the hood is one of the few I've seen that actually works well.
</p> 
<h3>SQ36</h3> 
<p>This is a PR36 with a large offset firebox on the right, a chimney properly 
located at the base of the cooker on the left, and a clever duct system with 
holes that helps move the smoke across the bottom of the smoke chamber, 
distributing it more evenly. The firebox has a flat top that can be used as a 
sauce and side dish warmer, but it does not open to do double duty as a grill.
</p> 
<h3>PR42, PR60, PR72, PR60GT, PR72GT</h3> 
<p>These are pretty much the same design as the PR36 with minor changes. For 
example the lower vents are sliders not flaps. The<strong>PR42</strong> has 20 
x 42&quot; grates and will hold a 100 pound hog. The<strong>PR60</strong> has 
24 x 58&quot; grates for hogs up to 250 pounds. The<strong>PR72</strong> has 24 
x 70&quot; grates and can handle a huge 325 pound hog. The<strong>-GT</strong> 
models are propane gas fired trailer units.</p> 
<h2>The BBQ Series</h2> 
<p>These babies are designed for fast and hot grilling. Great for chicken, 
steaks, chops, burgers, and more, caterers fondly call them &quot;chicken 
cookers&quot; because there is no better way to cook birds than with their 
double sided pivoting grates of expanded stainless steel. Meat is sandwiched 
between two grates that are on a center pivot. Time to turn? Pull the pin, turn 
the handle and the whole grate flips just like a jukebox turning over a record 
(yes, I am that old).</p> 
<h3>BBQ26 &amp; BBQ26S</h3> 
<p>The <strong>BBQ26</strong> looks like a giant Hibachi, with no lid, this 
boring black box is 32&quot; long by 21&quot; wide by 20.5&quot; tall on heavy 
wire legs. It weighs a substantial 60 pounds. You'd be pardoned for thinking it 
is just another portable grill, but you'd be wrong. It is really a killer 
tailgater in disguise.</p> 
<p>Its double sided 16&quot; by 24&quot; cooking grate covers 384 square 
inches means that you can load on a mess of food and flip it in all with one 
hand. Meadow Creek says that its will cook up to 15 chickens, needing only 10 
to 15 pounds of charcoal. Buy the optional trailer hitch connection, and you're 
bound to have a winning season even if your team doesn't. There is also an 
optional charcoal pan that can place the coal just inches below the cooking 
grate.</p> 
<p>Its legs are one drawback. They're short thick-gauge wire, designed to sit 
low to the ground, better for fitting in the trunk or on the truckbed than 
backyard.</p> 
<p>The BBQ26S stands waist high on long legs made of pipes with non-locking 
casters and a vented lid. Designed for grilling, close the lid and you can pull 
off some small-scale rib, brisket, and pork shoulder smoking, but this is not 
the ideal configuration for 2-zone indirect cooking or smoking.</p> 
<h3>BBQ42</h3> 
<p>It's got the numbers: 39&quot; high by 55.5&quot; long by 30&quot; wide, 
with a 22&quot; by 40&quot; double grate for a healthy 880 square inches of 
cooking surface that you can flip all at once with one hand. The bottom is 
18&quot; away but there is a charcoal tray that allows you to place the coals 
just below the cooking grate. Like Meadow Creek's other offerings, you'll find 
this one solid, weighing in at 250 pounds.</p> 
<p>Designed for grilling large quantities of chicken, the manufacturer claims 
that its capacity is more than 40 pounds of cut up birds. It is large enough 
that it can be setup for 2-zone or indirect cooking and for smoking. The 
standard lid is not very tall, so you won't be able to get a turkey on, but an 
optional lid is 10&quot; deep. It&rsquo;s still a grill at heart, though.</p> 
<p>You can also customize it with a pull-out ash tray, a trailer hitch. All in 
all, it looks like the muscle you need to take care of a decent-sized party or 
to start your catering biz.</p> 
<h3>BBQ-42C</h3> 
<p>Also in the BBQ line is the BBQ42C, a scaled-back version of the BBQ42 
that's meant to be added to a trailer (or else never be moved). It is, very 
simply, a big black box, no lid, no handles, and a stainless steel chicken 
grate. The box metal is 13 gauge steel and the overall dimensions are 22 
1/2&quot; high, 55 1/2&quot; long, and 28&quot; wide. It had a 13 gauge bottom 
tray and 4 side pins; standard options include a charcoal pan, a cover, and a 
stainless steel flat grate (as opposed to the chicken basket grates). A 
13-gauge lid is available as a custom option.</p> 
<h3>Large commercial and trailer mounted units</h3> 
<p>Meadow Creek has several very nice large professional units that are 
discussed on the page devoted to those smokers and grills.</p>

<h2>Meco Aussie Swinger</h2> 
<p>An inexpensive enamel painted square grill with a cooking grate that tilts 
so you can adjust the distance from the fire. The lid is hinged, and there are 
two side trays on some models. The grate surface is 21.5&quot; on all sides or 
342 square inches, just fine for indirect cooking. A real bargain. Click here 
for more info and pricing:Meco. - <em>Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Napoleon Mirage Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>This stainless steel unit has 605 square inches of cooking surface, with an 
adjustable height charcoal grate that has several positions, not infinitely 
adjustable. There is a front door for access to the charcoal during cooking, 
and the hood is double lined, a nice feature to help keep heat in. Comes with a 
lamp and a unique rotisserie design with a special vertical charcoal hopper at 
the rear just for the rotisserie. The cart has plenty of storage space, but air 
vents on the sides mean that it is not waterproof. Limited lifetime warranty.

<p>I have never seen these up close, but they look good on the web. - <em>

<h2><strong>Portable Kitchen (PK) Grill</strong></h2> 
<p>An elegant throwback design resurrected from 1952, this rustproof, cast 
aluminum charcoal grill has a flat bottom making it easy to push the coals to 
one side for smoking and indirect cooking. There are adjustable dampers in the 
lid and under the fire. The 306 square inch grate is hinged for adding coals, 
and the oven can be lifted off the cart for cleaning, camping, or tailgating.

<h2>Santa Maria Grills</h2> 
<p>A nice selection of Santa Maria style grills with cranks that raise and 
lower the food into the pit, but no lid.</p> 
<h2>Texas Pit Crafters</h2> 
<p>Makes high quality side firebox charcoal and wood smokers as well as grills 
that have adjustable-height racks (a very useful feature). They also make some 
pretty nifty hybrid cookers that use propane, charcoal, wood, and have 
rotisseries, and just about any other feature you might want. Click the link

<h2><strong>Weber Kettles</strong></h2> 
<p>The most popular grill in the world by far is the 22.5&quot; Weber Kettle. 
This popular design hasn't made major changes in many years, and with good 
reason. It works. They now come in four sizes, the<strong>Smokey Joe</strong> 
with a 14.5&quot; diameter grill surface,<strong>the 18.5&quot; kettle</strong>
, the<strong>22.5&quot; kettle</strong>, the <strong>26.75&quot; kettle</strong>
, and the<strong>Weber Ranch Kettle</strong> which is 37.5&quot; diameter.</p> 
<p>As simple as they are, there are some clever design features. The paint is 
very hard to chip and it can sit in the rain and snow years on end and be no 
worse for the wear. The lids fit tightly so oxygen control, and therefore heat 
control, is very good. The one-touch models make ash removal easy. And they are 
cheap.</p> 
<p>The problem I have with kettles, is that the bottom bowl is curved. While 
one can set up a2-Zone or Indirect cooking environment, it is less than ideal 
because the sides are pushed in. The curve makes it hard to move the coals to 
one side on the two smaller models. Also there is no easy way to raise the 
coals so you can deliver more heat to meat surfaces for searing when needed, so 
I do it on my 22.5&quot; unit by putting the coals on an extra grate I bought 
on top of some bricks. A bit of a kluge but it works. The three legged base is 
a bit flimsy, and the grates are thin chrome plated steel.</p> 
<p><strong>Weber Accessories.</strong> Weber sells a wide range of 
accessories, many of which are among the best in class. My favorite is by a 
third party, theSmokenator, with which you can make your 22.5&quot; Weber 
Kettle into a very capable smoker. Click here for moreinfo on accessories.</p> 
<h2><strong>Weber One-Touch 22.5&quot; Silver &amp; Gold</strong></h2> 
<p>The 22.5&quot; <strong>Weber One-Touch Silver</strong> has about 397 square 
inches of cooking surface and sells for under $100. It is the basic unadorned 
low price Kettle, and a perfectly fine cooking tool just the same. I love mine. 
Ash is swept through the vent holes in the bottom by a lever into an aluminum 
bowl under the grill by a lever beneath the bowl and it drops into a pan. 
Simple.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Weber One-Touch Gold</strong> (shown at right) is the same 
basic 22.5&quot; kettle body as the One-Touch Silver but instead of just slots 
on the bottom through which ash falls onto an open tray, the Gold has an 
enclosed receptacle attached to the bottom to capture and hold ash so it cannot 
blow. It comes off quickly for easy disposal of ash. -<em>Meathead</em></p> 
<h2>Weber 22.5&quot; Performer</h2> 
<p>There's this thing I call the &quot;ooh factor.&quot; When you see a 
device, if your first response is &quot;Ooh!&quot; then you&rsquo;re halfway on 
your way to buying it! That&rsquo;s the reaction a charcoal griller has to have 
when seeing the Weber 22.5&quot; Performer. That is one well-though-out grill 
and cart combination. It&rsquo;s got a spacious prep table on the side, a gas 
ignition system (but the fuel is still charcoal), a holder for the grill lid, 
hinged grate, a steel frame, an efficient ash-catcher, nice stainless steel 
hooks for your tools, a tip-out charcoal bin, a thermometer in the dome, and 
two charcoal holders that are useful for banking your coals. What&rsquo;s not 
to like?</p> 
<p>But wait a minute&hellip; what if your budget is tight? Is it worth it? 
It&rsquo;s essentially the Weber One-Touch Gold with a really good cart and a 
gas ignition system. The price for the One-Touch Gold is under $150, but the 
Performer goes for almost $330. You&rsquo;re paying $180 for that fancy cart. 
If you don&rsquo;t want to mess around with a chimney full of hot coals, this 
can be a dandy work-saver (not to mention a foot-saver).</p> 
<p>Owners praise the tough, spacious prep shelf, though one remarked that its 
textured surface and inset screws make it a little tough to clean. Assembly is 
easy, according to folks who&rsquo;ve built it, and users generally feel 
they&rsquo;ve gotten their money's worth. One owner mentioned how easy the 
lighting system is, and says it's great for scooping unlit coals into the 
center and relighting them. One drawback, though, is that you can&rsquo;t 
really use the lighting system with the charcoal holders that push the coals to 
the side for indirect cooking. The coals have to be in the center to be lit. 
There's a thermometer in the lid, but as always, it&rsquo;s best to bring your 
own digital grill thermometer. Dome temp and grate temp can vary significantly.
</p> 
<p>So is the ignition system and the cart worth the $180 more than just the 
One-Touch Gold? Ask yourself this: Is the &quot;ooh!&quot; worth it?<em>- Scot 
Murphy</em></p> 
<h2>Weber 26.75&quot; One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill</h2> 
<p>The Weber 26.75&quot; One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill is my favorite size in 
the kettle lineup. It is pretty much the same as the 22.5&quot; One Touch Gold 
(above) but the larger grate equals 508 square inches of cooking surface on a 
stainless steel hinged cooking grate, a removable ash catcher, lid mounted 
thermometer, two charcoal baskets for indirect grilling, and a lid holder.</p> 
<h2>Yoder</h2> 
<p>Yoder is very well respected for tube shaped offset smokers. They make a 
32&quot; long one for grilling that can also be used for smoking. It is reviewed
on the page with the smoker reviews, here.</p> <br>

<p><strong>Our philosophy</strong> about food is simple. First of all it must 
taste great. It must be easy to make and emphasize fresh seasonal products with 
a minimum of processed ingredients. We think that people need to know why as 
well as how, so we spend a lot of time explaining things, and we believe that 
there are no rules in the bedroom or dining room.</p>

Silver, and Bronze Medals</strong> are highly recommended products. Awards are

 AmazingRibs.com Best in BBQ Gold Medal Winners</h2> <strong>Here are 
some great products that have earnedThe</strong> <strong> AmazingRibs.com Best 
in BBQ Gold Medals. These are not ads!</strong> 
<p>Meat Temp Fridge Magnet</p> 
<p>The prize for Best BBQ Tool at the 2012 The National Barbecue Association 
conference went to a simple inexpensive fridge magnet by Meathead. It includes 
the latest USDA recommendations as well as chef recommendations (and they often 
differ) as well as color photos of the different stages of doneness for red 
meats. The temperatures are the same for both indoor and outdoor cooks.Click 
here for more info and how to order it.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h2>GrillGrates Take You To The Infrared Zone</h2> 
<p>GrillGrates are the best new product I have tested in years and the best 
thing to happen to beef since salt and pepper. The base superheats, eliminates 
hot spots, and blocks flareups. This is the concept behind the expensive new 
infrared grills. A must for gas grills.Click here for more about GrillGrates.
</p> <br>

<h2>The Smokenator: A Necessity For All Weber Kettles</h2> 
<p>If you have a Weber Kettle, you need the amazing Smokenator and Hovergrill. 
The Smokenator turns your grill into a first class smoker, and the Hovergrill 
can add capacity or be used to create steakhouse steaks.Click here to read more.
</p> 
<h2><strong>ThermoWorks Pocket Thermometer - No More Guessing</strong></h2> 
<p>A good thermometer is why I never serve overcooked or undercooked food. 
This one has a very thin tip with a tiny thermocouple so it gives an accurate 
reading in just six seconds. I cannot recommend it more highly. It will improve 
your cooking overnight and pay for itself in a hurry. And it is inexpensive.

<p></p> 
<p>Steakhouse Knives</p> 
<p>These are the same knives used at the best steakhouses (Peter Luger, Smith 
&amp; Wollensky, Morton's and others). Machine washable, temper-ground, 
serrated, high-carbon stainless-steel, full-tang blades with excellent cutting 
edge retention, beefy hardwood handle, rust and stain resistant, and they stay 
shiny without polishing. And now they have the AmazingRibs.com imprimatur.Click 
here for more info on these wonderful knives.</p>
