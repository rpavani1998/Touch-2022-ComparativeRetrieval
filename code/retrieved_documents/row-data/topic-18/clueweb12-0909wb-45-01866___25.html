<h2><strong>Reviewers</strong></h2> 
<p>Many reviews are by Meathead, the author of most things on this website. In 
2012Max Good joined our staff as Director of Buyer's Guides and more and more 
of the reviews come from him. A few reviews have been contributed by Scot 
Murphy and Gordon Hubbell.</p> 
<h2><strong>Best In BBQ Medals</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Best In BBQ Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals are given only 
to products that we highly recommend based on price. Awards are based on 
features, quality, and value. Price is an important factor. Rarely will a $400 
Gold Medal be in the same league as an $800 Gold Medal, so it is important that 
you read the reviews. Rest assured that when we award a medal, it is because we 
are impressed by it for the price, not because someone has paid us to say so or 
because the company is an advertiser or sponsor.<strong>Manufacturers: </strong>

no charge) and for info on how to get a high resolution version.</p> 
<h2>About Model Numbers</h2> 
<p>Manufacturers often make slight variations to their basic model exclusively 
for certain merchants. For example, a grill manufacturer might make their 
Firebrand Grill Model ABC123 with cast iron grates available only on Amazon. 
Meanwhile, the ABC125 is identical except it has stainless steel grates, and it 
is sold only at ACE Hardware. Of course the prices can differ.</p> 
<h2><strong>Your Amazon Purchase Supports This Site</strong></h2> 
<p>When a product is available on Amazon.com, we often provide a direct link. 
Amazon often has the best prices anywhere, even better than many manufacturers' 
websites because manufacturers know that if they undercut retailers like 
Amazon, they may drop the products. Amazon also offers fast delivery (often 
free), no sales tax (in most states), gift wrapping (on many items), and 
painless refund policies. Check outAmazon's Gift &amp; Wish Registry.</p> 
<p><strong>IMPORTANT. </strong>Amazon pays AmazingRibs Inc. a small referral 
fee when you purchase from them after clicking on a link on this site, so 
purchasing from them helps underwrite the cost of operating AmazingRibs.com.</p>
<p>If you like all the info we give you for free and would like to help us 
stay free, please copy the link below and save it. It takes you to Amazon.com 
and tags things you buy with the AmazingRibs code so we get that referral fee. 
It works on anything from grills to diapers and it has zero impact on the price

<h2>Seasoning and calibrating your grill or smoker with dry runs</h2> 
<p>The first thing to do after you assemble your new grill or smoker is to 
season it and calibrate it by doing a few dry runs <em>without food</em>. This 
will burn off any manufacturer's grease, and give you a sense for how to set it 
up to hit the two important target temps that almost all my recipes use: 
225&deg;F and 325&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Of course, in order to do this, you <em>absolutely positively</em> must 
have a gooddigital oven thermometer. I don't care how much you spent on your 
grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and 
unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50&deg;F. Worse still, it is in 
the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. 
Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food.</p> <br>

<h2>Tailgating and game checklist</h2> 
<p>Here's my checklist for a football tailgater. Feel free to copy and paste 
it and print it.</p> 
<p>Start planning early. Check the rules on the place you plan to park. Some 
lots do not permit tailgating, some do not allow charcoal grills, some do not 
allow adult beverages, some do not allow glass bottles, and some do not allow 
trailers.</p> 
<p>Do as much prep in advance as possible. For example, if you plan to make 
omelets for breakfast, break and mix the eggs, add the herbs and whatever else 
was going in, pour them in a jar, and then all you need to do is pour them into 
the hot pan with butter.</p> 
<p>Save and clean empty milk jugs, and freeze water in them. The frozen 
bottles can keep food cold, and can be used for drinking.</p> 
<p>It is especially important that you pay close attention to food safety when 
you are away from refrigeration and running hot water. Readmy page about food 
safety. Remember to keep food below 40&deg;F or above 150&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Buy an empty spray bottle at the drug store and fill it with a dilute 
solution of household bleach. USDA recommends a solution of one tablespoon of 
5% unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Bleach is a powerful 
sanitizer. That's why they put it in swimming pools. After washing cutting 
boards, knives, meat grinders, counters, etc., it's a good idea to sanitize 
with bleach. Flood surfaces with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for 
several minutes. Rinse with clear water and air or pat dry with clean paper 
towels.</p> 
<p>Arrive early so there is no rush, and stay after. Let the crowds fight 
their way out. Relax. Have some snacks and a beverage.</p>

<h2>The football-ribs relationship</h2> 
<p>Why is barbecue so popular at football tailgate parties?</p> 
<p>As any fan will tell you the greensward the game is played on, marked with 
parallel white stripes, is called a<em>gridiron</em>. What she may not know is 
that a gridiron is an early name for the iron grate with parallel bars upon 
which meat is cooked over coals.</p> 
<p>And what is the central object of the game of football? A pigskin, of 
course, even though it hasn't been made of pigskin for decades.</p> <br>
<br>

<h1></h1> 
<h1>Tailgate Grills, Camping Grills, And Portable Grills Of All Sizes</h1> 
<p>For the tailgate party, balcony, beach, back country hike, cattle drive, 
Winnebago trip, or on your yacht, you need a portable grill.</p> 
<p>When shopping for a portable, the same rules apply as when you are shopping 
for other grills. You need to consider price, temperature control, ease of 
cleanup, ability to smoke foods, high heat, durability, safety, and, of course, 
size and weight.</p> 
<p>Many of the small units don't have lids. Try to get one with a cover for 
the best temperature control and to prevent burning thicker meats. Try to get 
enough surface area so you can push the coals to one side for indirect cooking 
and to prevent burning.</p> 
<p>When out and about, I usually look for convenience, and because a small 
bottle of propane will last a long time and it's a heckuva lot lighter than 
charcoal, my favorite small portable is a lightweightWeber 1520 Gas Go-Anywhere 
Gas Grill.</p> 
<p>There are many options, from throwaways, to tried and true Hibachis, to 
some pretty snazzy rigs. I have not had a chance to work with many of these, so 
I list them alphabetically with no comment at this time. The listings are down 
the page a bit since I have devoted so much space to the GoGalley.</p> 
<p>Click here to see many the portable grills on Amazon.com all at once.</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>GoGalley: The Best Portable Rig Ever</h1> 
<p>I'm a big football fan, an undersized high school linebacker who even did 
spring training with the University of Florida Gatorsas Paper Gator when I was 
sports editor of the campus paper (click the link to read about my dubious 
record at the Swamp). I'm the guy who knows enough about the game to scream at 
the coaches from deep in the end zone bleachers as if they'll hear and heed me.
</p> 
<p>My playing career is loooong behind me so now I have gotten serious about 
tailgating. I love nothing more than going to Bears games in the snow and 
getting there early enough to cook a hearty meal and down a few adult beverages.
</p> 
<p>Tailgating is such a ritual that I even have a checklist of what to take. I 
usually bring a small portable gas grill or charcoal grill, but in the fall of 
2011, thanks to the manufacturer, I had the opportunity to amp up my game with 
a new product, theGoGalley.</p> 
<p>Packed with innovation, this is the best rig I've ever seen for tailgating 
or camping. But GoGalley is not just for football games. Heck it is even a fine 
backyard setup. It is not cheap at about $2,000, but it is a bargain for what 
it has under the hood and what it does.</p> 
<p>The GoGalley is a single unit that contains a grill, a smoker/oven, a side 
burner, large work surfaces, storage, and a trailer hitch. But that is like 
saying an F-22 is a jet with some weapons. This baby has everything except the 
kitchen sink.</p> 
<h2>Mobility</h2> 
<p>Let's start with the most clever innovation on this rig: The trailer hitch 
and the way the designers have made the GoGalley portable.</p> 
<p>The whole shebang folds up into a box that is 32.5&quot; wide, 49&quot; 
tall, and 41&quot; deep plus 10&quot; for the trailer hitch. It fits nicely on 
the skid on which it is shipped.</p> 
<p>It weighs about 350 pounds. When it is folded up, you roll it back to the 
trailer hitch on your car or truck, remove a large T shaped heavy duty 
handscrew that holds the trailer hitch securely to the body, and move the hitch 
on the grill in position to mate with the vehicle. Slide the two together, lock 
them, toggle a switch on the grill's side, and a battery powered motor and 
cable winches the unit up off the ground and snug against the vehicle's hitch. 
Put the T screw back in place, lock it to the hitch, slide the casters off, and 
there's enough clearance to motor down the road at highway speeds. Exact 
clearance height will depend on your vehicle. The hitch connection fits a DOT 
approved 2&quot; square receiver hitch with a minimum of class III rating which 
means it can handle up to 500 pounds. If your hitch is smaller, there are 
adapters available.</p> 
<p>This design is especially cool because some universities, like Notre Dame, 
prohibit trailers in their tailgating lots. When you get to the stadium or 
campground, lower it with the winch, unlock it, unfold it so the sideburner is 
on one side and the smoker is on the other side, lift the work tables, and you 
have everything but the kitchen sink. Setting up takes about 3 minutes if you 
stop to drink a beer.</p> 
<p>You can fold it up and lock it back on the trailer hitch while you're at 
the game and never have to worry about someone stealing it. After the game you 
can be back up and running in minutes.</p> 
<h2>Versatility</h2> 
<p>GoGalley is designed for portability, but there is no reason it can't be 
used in your back yard. It can be opened up into a straight line as in the 
photo above, or in a V shape, or even a U shape making for a very compact and 
efficient kitchen. The wheels on the side cabinets lock tight when you decide 
on your configuration.</p> 
<p><strong>Gas grill.</strong> The center section is a 4-burner gas grill with 
540 square inches of primary cooking surface and a 150 square inch removable 
warming rack above. The main grates are cast iron and are held in tight by 
three screws so they won't bounce out in transit. The burners line up side to 
side so you can cookindirect or have a hot zone on one side and a warm zone on 
the other. There are porcelain coated heat diffuser plates above the stainless 
steel burners and a tray under the grill is angled to catch and drain grease to 
a small pan in the cabinet that is easy to remove. The burners light with a 
push-button piezo switch, and the designers have put in two of them in case one 
fails, which it shouldn't. The propane tank straps into the storage cabinet 
below the grill, but you should remove it when driving. The hood is double 
layered on the top to help retain heat. I had not trouble getting it over 
600&deg;F on a 70&deg;F day as measured by my lab grade thermocouples.</p> 
<p><strong>Smoker/oven.</strong> When GoGalley is unfurled, there is a nifty 
gas smoker and oven on the right that, if it was a standalone it might be the 
best gas smoker on the market. Unlikeall the others, this one is not flimsy. It 
has a solid steel frame, double walls, two exhaust vents, a stainless steel 
burner, and silicone door gaskets. It has a cast iron box for smoke chips and a 
water pan right above it for humidity. There are four 12&quot; wide by 14&quot; 
long removable shelves that can hold 8 short racks of baby backs, 4 whole 
chickens, 4 pork butts, etc. Skip the wood chips and you have an oven that can 
be used as a warming oven or for baking cookies, rolls, or beans. When pegged 
on low with the water pan in place it can smoke at an ideal 225&deg;F easily 
(most cabinet gassers cannot go this low). The top of the smoker gets hot so it 
can be used to keep a serving platter warm, but it can also burn you if you're 
not careful, and you don't want to absently mindedly put an unopened beer on it.
</p> 
<p><strong>Burner/boiler/fryer.</strong> The left side has a big cast iron 
burner that puts out 25,000 BTU. There are three levels on which it can be set. 
Raise it up to use a large skillet, wok, or griddle, drop it down low to insert 
the capacious six gallon aluminum cauldron that comes with the system. The pot 
has a perforated insert. You can fry a pretty good size turkey in that baby or 
boil a mess of lobsters. If you are foolish enough to overfill the turkey fryer 
or put a frozen bird into the oil and it overflows and catches on fire, there 
is an emergency fuel turn-off under the grill that goes from open to closed 
with a quarter turn.</p> 
<p><strong>Work tables. </strong>Then raise up the two 29&quot; long stainless 
steel work tables, one on each side, and there enough room for prep and 
serving. They are sturdy enough to hold whatever you need, but I wouldn't sit 
on them. The wing on the left has a hole for a standard 13 gallon garbage bag 
and a ring that holds it in place. There are even tool hooks on the tables. 
Nice details.</p> 
<h2>Construction</h2> 
<p>There is a one year guarantee on parts and workmanship. How well will it 
take a beating riding on the back of an SUV to the games and being rolled 
around parking lots? The body is framed with square tubular heavy duty 11 gage 
steel and parts appear to be welded properly. The moving parts use long heavy 
piano hinges. Latches appear to be well made and mounted.</p> 
<p>Many parts are stainless and the rest is powder coated, a nice sturdy 
finish, but black is the only color available at the moment. I am told an all 
stainless option is in the works.</p> 
<p>It comes with a heavy duty vinyl coated water proof cover made from the 
trap material used for hauling steel on flat bed trucks. I'm not all that 
confident in the Velcro straps that hold the cover down when on the highway, 
but so far they have done the job.</p> 
<p>It comes with two bimetal dial thermometers that work pretty well when I 
compared them to my lab grade thermocouples, but, as always, you should use
digital thermometers to be sure.</p> 
<h2>Cooking with the GoGalley</h2> 
<h2></h2> 
<p>The manufacturer sent me one of the first units off the assembly line and I 
took it to a 2:30 p.m. college football game at Soldier Field in Chicago. We 
got there at about 9 a.m., claimed a great parking space, and put myLast Meal 
Ribs in the smoker. I had put Meathead's Memphis Dust on them the night and cut 
them in half so there was plenty of room around them in the smoker.</p> 
<p>Then I made omelets for breakfast. I had broken the eggs before we left 
home, chopped some fresh herbs into the mix, and poured it into a plastic 
bottle. When I got there all I had to do was drop some butter into the hot 
non-stick pan on the side burner, shake the bottle, and pour in the eggs.</p> 
<p>The ribs were ready by noon. I pulled them out of the smoker, tossed them 
on the hot grill, painted on the sauce, and sizzled them for about three 
minutes per side so the sugars would caramelize. Needless to say, our campsite 
was popular with passersby. Meanwhile I was putting the finishing touches on
Italian sassiges on the grill (there's plenty of room for them and the ribs) 
while my wife was frying some onions and peppers in olive oil on the side 
burner. When the ribs came off I toasted the inside of the buns for the 
sausages on the grill, nestled the sausages in, and topped them with the fried 
onions and peppers. Condiments were laid out on the side tables, and the 
platter of ribs was placed on top of the smoker to stay warm.</p> 
<p>The other night I made smoked burgers, so easy with this unit. I popped a 
couple of 6 ounce ground chuck patties in the smoker at about 225&deg;F, tossed 
in a handful of pellets, and 10 minutes later took them out and put the on the 
preheated grill to build the crust. Now there's a sure-fire hit for your next 
tailgater.</p> 
<h2>Bugs</h2> 
<p>There are a few minor bugs to be ironed out with future designs (this is, 
after all version, 1.0), but absolutely nothing serious enough that would make 
me postpone a purchase.</p> 
<p>The big wheels make rolling it around easy, but they must be removed when 
GoGalley is attached to your vehicle and you are motoring down the highway or 
they will scrape bottom. They are very easy to put in place and locking them is 
done by tightening a large T-shaped thumbscrew. But if you don't get that screw 
down tight, the wheels can pop off if you hit a big crack in the ground. Just 
make sure you tighten them well, perhaps with a pair of pliers. Even with the 
wheels removed, the unit can come close to scraping bottom on some smaller SUVs 
with a low mounted hitch. Also, the unit must be on level surface when you 
detach it from the hitch or it will be difficult to extract the tongue from the 
hitch.</p> 
<p>The front wheels have an easy to use locking mechanism to prevent GoGalley 
from rolling when it is in use. Alas, the locks can't be accessed when the unit 
is folded. The wheels are so good that it just might roll away without locking 
them down, so I recommend putting the front wheels on the back and visa versa 
so you can lock the rear wheels when it is still folded.</p> 
<p>For some reason, there is no igniter for the side burner and it must be lit 
with a match or a lighter and the markings on the knob for the side burner as 
well as the knob for the smoker don't line up properly on mine. Federal safety 
laws require lots of vents on gas grills to allow air in and combustion gases 
out. when hauling GoGalley I am concerned that some water and mud may get into 
the cabinet under the grill through vents in the bottom, but I haven't tested 
this yet.</p> 
<p>The side burner has a small round metal disk that keeps rain out of the 
side burner. I would prefer a square lid that will cover the whole left side 
cabinet and a door to keep out rain and snow when I am cooking (hey, I'm no 
fair weather fan!). Also, when I am done cooking I leave the unit uncovered to 
cool before I put the vinyl cover on and, well, sometimes adult beverages are 
served and I forget, and that left side is unprotected.</p> 
<p>Alas, the only major shortcoming of the GoGalley is that it lacks a sink. 
And it can't guarantee a victory for the home team.<br>

<p><strong>Our philosophy</strong> about food is simple. First of all it must 
taste great. It must be easy to make and emphasize fresh seasonal products with 
a minimum of processed ingredients. We think that people need to know why as 
well as how, so we spend a lot of time explaining things, and we believe that 
there are no rules in the bedroom or dining room.</p>

Silver, and Bronze Medals</strong> are highly recommended products. Awards are

 AmazingRibs.com Best in BBQ Gold Medal Winners</h2> <strong>Here are 
some great products that have earnedThe</strong> <strong> AmazingRibs.com Best 
in BBQ Gold Medals. These are not ads!</strong> 
<p>Meat Temp Fridge Magnet</p> 
<p>The prize for Best BBQ Tool at the 2012 The National Barbecue Association 
conference went to a simple inexpensive fridge magnet by Meathead. It includes 
the latest USDA recommendations as well as chef recommendations (and they often 
differ) as well as color photos of the different stages of doneness for red 
meats. The temperatures are the same for both indoor and outdoor cooks.Click 
here for more info and how to order it.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h2>GrillGrates Take You To The Infrared Zone</h2> 
<p>GrillGrates are the best new product I have tested in years and the best 
thing to happen to beef since salt and pepper. The base superheats, eliminates 
hot spots, and blocks flareups. This is the concept behind the expensive new 
infrared grills. A must for gas grills.Click here for more about GrillGrates.
</p> <br>

<h2>The Smokenator: A Necessity For All Weber Kettles</h2> 
<p>If you have a Weber Kettle, you need the amazing Smokenator and Hovergrill. 
The Smokenator turns your grill into a first class smoker, and the Hovergrill 
can add capacity or be used to create steakhouse steaks.Click here to read more.
</p> 
<h2><strong>ThermoWorks Pocket Thermometer - No More Guessing</strong></h2> 
<p>A good thermometer is why I never serve overcooked or undercooked food. 
This one has a very thin tip with a tiny thermocouple so it gives an accurate 
reading in just six seconds. I cannot recommend it more highly. It will improve 
your cooking overnight and pay for itself in a hurry. And it is inexpensive.

<p></p> 
<p>Steakhouse Knives</p> 
<p>These are the same knives used at the best steakhouses (Peter Luger, Smith 
&amp; Wollensky, Morton's and others). Machine washable, temper-ground, 
serrated, high-carbon stainless-steel, full-tang blades with excellent cutting 
edge retention, beefy hardwood handle, rust and stain resistant, and they stay 
shiny without polishing. And now they have the AmazingRibs.com imprimatur.Click 
here for more info on these wonderful knives.</p>
