<p>ACTIVATED CHARCOAL FIBER SOLVENT GAS ADSORBER </p> 
<p> <b>1. General </b> </p> 
<blockquote>  A most outstanding feature of this method is that cycling times 
of adsorption and desorption are about 10 minutes respectively. This owes to 
the fact that diameter of the activated charcoal fiber is 15 micro- m to 20 
micro- m, which is smaller by hundreds first than few millimeters of an 
activated charcoal used in a fixed bed. As a result, a solvent gas is adsorbed 
and desorbed at a higher rate with shorter break band, saving the quantity of 
activated charcoal.<br>

<p> </p> </blockquote> <b>2. Process Description </b> 
<blockquote> The flow sheet illustrated below shows adsorption in the first 
activated charcoal tower and desorption in the second activated charcoal tower. 
The two activated charcoal towers repeats adsorption and desorption alternately.
<br> 
<p> When gas containing a solvent enters an activated charcoal tower, the 
solvent is adsorbed from the gas while it passes the cylindrically rolled 
activated charcoal fiber elements from its outer to inner circumference and the 
processed gas is discharged through top of the system as purified gas. Another 
activated charcoal tower blows water vapor through inner circumference of the 
activated charcoal fiber element to desorb the adsorbed solvent, and mixture of 
the solvent vapor and water vapor is introduced into the capacitor through 
outer circumference of the element and recovered as a high purity solvent after 
being separated from clarified and cooled water.<br>

<blockquote> 1) Highly efficient adsorption <br>

<blockquote> Organic solvents contained in exhaust gas are adsorbed and 
purified efficiently by the activated charcoal fiber.<br>
</blockquote> 2) 
Recovery of high quality solvent<br>

<blockquote> Adsorption and regeneration in short time gives less thermal 
effects on the solvent, so that high purity solvent can be recovered.<br>

</blockquote> 3) Lost cost of equipment <br>

<blockquote> Since a recovered chlorine-containing solvent has no HCl as a 
by-product due to low pH of clarified water, there is no need to use a high 
grade corrosion-resistant material, saving equipment costs.<br>
