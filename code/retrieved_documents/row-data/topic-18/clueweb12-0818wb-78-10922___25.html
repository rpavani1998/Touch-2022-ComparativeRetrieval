<h2><strong>Reviewers</strong></h2> 
<p>Many reviews are by Meathead, the author of most things on this website. In 
2012Max Good joined our staff as Director of Buyer's Guides and more and more 
of the reviews come from him. A few reviews have been contributed by Scot 
Murphy and Gordon Hubbell.</p> 
<h2><strong>Best In BBQ Medals</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Best In BBQ Gold, Silver, and Bronze Medals are given only 
to products that we highly recommend based on price. Awards are based on 
features, quality, and value. Price is an important factor. Rarely will a $400 
Gold Medal be in the same league as an $800 Gold Medal, so it is important that 
you read the reviews. Rest assured that when we award a medal, it is because we 
are impressed by it for the price, not because someone has paid us to say so or 
because the company is an advertiser or sponsor.<strong>Manufacturers: </strong>

no charge) and for info on how to get a high resolution version.</p> 
<h2>About Model Numbers</h2> 
<p>Manufacturers often make slight variations to their basic model exclusively 
for certain merchants. For example, a grill manufacturer might make their 
Firebrand Grill Model ABC123 with cast iron grates available only on Amazon. 
Meanwhile, the ABC125 is identical except it has stainless steel grates, and it 
is sold only at ACE Hardware. Of course the prices can differ.</p> 
<h2><strong>Your Amazon Purchase Supports This Site</strong></h2> 
<p>When a product is available on Amazon.com, we often provide a direct link. 
Amazon often has the best prices anywhere, even better than many manufacturers' 
websites because manufacturers know that if they undercut retailers like 
Amazon, they may drop the products. Amazon also offers fast delivery (often 
free), no sales tax (in most states), gift wrapping (on many items), and 
painless refund policies. Check outAmazon's Gift &amp; Wish Registry.</p> 
<p><strong>IMPORTANT. </strong>Amazon pays AmazingRibs Inc. a small referral 
fee when you purchase from them after clicking on a link on this site, so 
purchasing from them helps underwrite the cost of operating AmazingRibs.com.</p>
<p>If you like all the info we give you for free and would like to help us 
stay free, please copy the link below and save it. It takes you to Amazon.com 
and tags things you buy with the AmazingRibs code so we get that referral fee.

<h2><strong>Other fuel choices</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Wood.</strong> There's no reason why you can't cook with the 
original fuel: Wood. Other than the fact that the flavor is very strong, and 
you have to use the right woods or the food will be inedible. There are several 
cowboy grills designed to hold your food a safe distance above wood or wood 
embers, good for your backyard a campfire in the wilderness.</p> 
<p>Nexo outdoor fireplaces are a steel reinforced, pumice-stone refractory 
core covered with sandstone rock or with white stucco made in Danish Island of 
Mors.</p> 
<p>I frequently cook steaks in my Weber Kettle over grape vine and fruit wood 
cuttings I collect when I prune my vines and trees. I dry stacks of the pencil 
thick sticks for a few months, and then stuff as many as I can into my grill. 
On goes the top grate. I light them from below and within 10 minutes I have 8' 
flames. They die down to white hot coals in about 10 minutes, and I have about 
15 minutes of 1000&deg;F temps to cook on before they die. Nice flavor, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wood Pellets.</strong> There are several nice grills that burn wood 
pellets made by compressing sawdust. They are great for smoke roasting, and 
they can get hot enough for direct heat grilling, they are not good direct heat 
grilling tools. At high temps there is not too much smoke flavor, but it is 
hard to escape the smokiness if you want to, and some things you just don't 
want smokey. Click here for more on<strong>wood pellet grills and smokers.
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> There is a new breed of electric grills that 
are ideal for apartments with small balconies. Some models can get quite hot. 
There is a lot of grease to clean, but many of them are non-stick coated and 
some of the parts can go into the dish washer.</p> <br>

<h2></h2> 
<h2>Seasoning and calibrating your grill or smoker with dry runs</h2> 
<p>The first thing to do after you assemble your new grill or smoker is to 
season it and calibrate it by doing a few dry runs <em>without food</em>. This 
will burn off any manufacturer's grease, and give you a sense for how to set it 
up to hit the two important target temps that almost all my recipes use: 
225&deg;F and 325&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Of course, in order to do this, you <em>absolutely positively</em> must 
have a gooddigital oven thermometer. I don't care how much you spent on your 
grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and 
unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50&deg;F. Worse still, it is in 
the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. 
Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food.</p> <br>

<br> 
<h1>Charcoal vs. Gas Grill Throwdown.<br>
 Let's settle this once and for all.
</h1> 
<p><strong><em>By Meathead</em></strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Gas or Charcoal&quot;? The second most asked question since 
&quot;Chicken or Egg?&quot; The flame war between charcoal grill purists and 
gas grill hotheads burns brighter than the debate between Mac and PC users. You 
should read some of the slop slung on the barbecue message boards. On second 
thought, don't. Let me try to sort it out for you with a few inflammatory 
thoughts.</p> 
<p>Grills are used mostly for three types of cooking:</p> 
<p>1) High heat direct radiation cooking when the food is placed directly 
above the heat source for things like steaks. Usually there is no lid over the 
meat.</p> 
<p>2) Indirect heat convection roasting for things like whole chickens and 
roasts when the heat source is off to the side and the food cooks by warm air 
circulating around it with the lid closed.</p> 
<p>3) Indirect heat smoke roasting with the lid closed when the warm 
convection airflow is heavy with flavorful hardwood smoke.</p> 
<p>Let's see how each fuel performs at these tasks and all the other factors.
</p> 
<h2>Is there a taste difference?</h2> 
<p>Let's cut to the most convincing argument: Probably 99% of the world's 
greatest steakhouses grill with gas. This is not just a matter of convenience 
or price. With the prices that steakhouses charge, they can afford any fuel 
they want. Why is this?</p> 
<p>Charcoal makes more smoke than gas, although, when lit completely, when 
ashed over, good charcoal produces little smoke and besides, it is not likely 
to penetrate deeply into food that is cooked quickly such as hot dogs, burgers, 
or steaks. When you cook low and slow, the smoke from charcoal is much more 
noticeable.</p> 
<p>Of course there are at least two different kinds of charcoal. Briquets, 
which are made from charcoal and a lot fillers and chemicals, and lump, which 
is pretty much just hardwood charcoal. For more info about charcoal, read my 
articleThe Zen of Charcoal.</p> 
<p>A lot of the smoke you see when grilling comes from drippings from the food 
hitting the hot surfaces below and from buildup on the grates and the inside of 
your grill. If you are using charcoal, only a little bit of it comes from the 
charcoal. If you are using gas, the smoke is invisible. Meat drippings are 
mostly water, fat, and protein, plus whatever you have added, such as marinade 
or sugar in barbecue sauce. When drippings hit the heat source they vaporize 
and some of that condenses on the meat and some penetrates into the meat. Most 
gas grills cover the flame jets with metal plates, lava rock, or ceramic rocks 
that absorb the heat and radiate it. Drippings hit these radiant surfaces where 
they are vaporized, making smoke and steam, just like charcoal. Some new gas 
grills have &quot;infrared&quot; burners which are superheated surfaces that 
are very close to the meat and more vapors get back to the meat with these 
burners.</p> 
<p>There is also a minor difference in the flavor imparted by combustion 
gases, the volatile by-products given off by the burning of the charcoal or the 
gas. When propane combusts it makes more steam than charcoal, and that may help 
keep meat moist giving gas an advantage for some meats. Some cooks think the 
steam can be a disadvantage for some meats, hampering chicken skin from getting 
crisp for example.</p> 
<p>There is one other flavor difference of note. If you use self-igniting 
charcoal or charcoal fluid to start a charcoal fire, there can be an unpleasant 
petrochemical smell during ignition and it can get into the food. Yuk. For this 
reason you should use a charcoal chimney or an electric charcoal starter.I 
strongly recommend the chimney because it is faster and easier and needs no 
outlet. My fave is theWeber Chimney Starter. Electric starter coils work well 
too, but they require an electic outlet.</p> 
<p>If you use your grill for <em>long low and slow smoke roasting</em>, there 
is a more noticeable difference in flavor. The combustion gases from charcoal 
when mixed with smoke from wood chips or chunks makes a distinctive flavor 
typical of traditional southern barbecue. On a propane grill, the flavor is a 
bit more bacon-like. Below you can see two slabs of St. Louis cut ribs cooked 
at the same temp side by side withMeathead's Memphis Dust only, no sauce. The 
one on the left was cooked with charcoal with wood chips for flavor. The one on 
right was cooked with gas and exacly the same amount of chips by weight. The 
charcoal ribs had a deeper smokier fireplace scent and flavor. The gas ribs had 
a better pork flavor with hints of bacon and they were moister. Which was 
better? Taste is a matter of taste. I loved them both.</p> 
<p><strong>But when it comes to direct heat grilling, which is usually fast, 
the fact is that,<em>if</em> all things are equal such as cooking temp, most 
folks can't tell the difference in the taste between charcoal and gas grilled 
food. That's a big if. Because most gas grills cannot achieve the same high 
heat as charcoal, charcoal is superior for getting that great dark crust on 
steaks that is much more flavorful than tan meat. If you use strong flavored 
rubs, marinades, and sauces, you will never notice taste differences especially 
because they hamper browning (read my article onmarinades). You may think you 
can, but blind tastings have shown that you probably can't. So if there is 
little taste difference, the choice comes down to functionality. That's why I 
own both.</strong></p> 
<h2><strong>Charcoal pros and cons</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Why we love charcoal grills. </strong>Charcoal purists are vehement 
and border on snobbery. They who would<em>never ever never</em> own a gas grill.
</p> 
<p>The most important reason to buy a charcoal grill is that charcoal can get 
hotter than<em>standard</em> gas grills, and heat is what you need to get 
steaks and lamb crisp on the outside and red or pink on the inside.</p> 
<p>Charcoal grills typically cook up to 500&deg;F or more. If you use a lot of 
coals or if the coals are raised close to the cooking surface, they can cook as 
hot as 700&deg;F or more. When I get my hands on top quality lamb or beef, I 
use bricks to raise the charcoal grate on my Weber Kettle to within 1&quot; of 
the meat and the result looks and tastes as good as anything you can get at 
Morton's (see the picture at the top of this page). I also use the Hovergrill 
that came with mySmokenator to raise the coals. It's a wire grate with legs 
that can sit on the charcoal grate placing the coals within 1&quot; of the 
meat. My favorite charcoal grills have a crank that let you raise and lower the 
charcoal bed.</p> 
<p>Charcoal, <em>especially before it is fully lit</em>, emits combustion 
gases and smoke flavors. When fully lit and ashed over, it produces less smoke 
flavor. But that smoke flavor is soooooo gooooood.</p> 
<p><strong>The down side.</strong> Charcoal is dirty to handle; it can be hard 
to light; it takes about 15 minutes longer to get up to temp; there can be 
flare-ups that can burn the food andflareups may be a health risk; it is hard 
to tell what temp you are cooking at; the temperature cannot be turned down 
rapidly; during long cooks it slowly loses heat and you need to add more 
charcoal; charcoal grills rarely have rotisseries; and there is a lot of ash to 
clean up after.</p> 
<p>Most of these problems are easily surmounted if you know how: If you use 
gloves, shovels, or tongs, you need never handle raw coals. If you keep the 
charcoal dry and use achimney, getting hot coals is easy. If you push the coals 
to one side of the grill and set up a 2-zone cooking environment, fatty meats 
like chicken skin do not drip on the coals and flare up, and even if there are 
flareups, a squirt gun can contain them. And cleanup of ash is easier with some 
of the one-touch grills or grills that have removable ash trays.</p> 
<p>The most important part of any cooking, indoor or out, is regulating heat. 
To do that you need areliable oven thermometer, and a little know-how that 
takes time to acquire.Alas I have never seen a charcoal grill with a half good 
thermometer, and the thermometer is never mounted where it is needed, near the 
meat. The temp in the top of the dome can be very different at meat level.</p> 
<p>Since charcoal grills do not have temperature dials to raise or lower temp, 
it is important to learn how to set up a2-zone fire which helps you regulate 
heat by moving meat from the hot to the medium zone, and learn how to control 
the energy of the fire by closing off the oxygen intake vents. They are your 
temperature dials.</p> 
<p>In short, cooking with charcoal can yield superlative results if you 
calibrate it and practice. The high heat is perfect for red meats, and if you 
learn your instrument, it will reward you handsomely. It is not intuitive and 
brainless, but there is little it cannot do when you achieve mastery, 
Grasshopper.</p> 
<p>Charcoal devotees claim it is the flavor, but for me, a lot of it is the 
ritual and the thrill of playing with fire.</p> 
<h2>Gas <strong>pros and cons</strong></h2> 
<p>Gas grills outsell charcoal grills and it is easy to understand why. They 
offer convenience and control. Those two words alone cinch the argument for 
many folks.</p> 
<p><strong>Why we love gas grills. </strong>They are easy to start, they heat 
up within 10 to 15 minutes, they hold temperatures steadily yet we can crank 
them up and cool them down in a hurry, they can be configured for indirect and 
multi-zone cooking, and they are easy to clean. If it's Tuesday, you're late 
getting home from work, and you need dinner ready in an hour, a gasser can do 
it. Low to mid-price gas grills typically have a top end of 100 to 450&deg;F. 
More expensive grills can get up to 700&deg;F. Newer high end models with sear 
burners can get as hot as charcoal.</p> 
<p><strong>Temp control. </strong>Although they excel at holding a steady 
temp, they are not perfect. A dial setting of 1 may equal 275&deg;F on a 
70&deg;F day, but it can be 225&deg;F on a cool, windy, or rainy day. Or 
300&deg;F on a hot day. Butonce you get to know your instrument, it is pretty 
easy to manage and if it has two or more burners it is easy to have two or more 
heat zones. On a three burner grill you might use a hot zone for meat, a medium 
zone for veggies, and a low zone for holding finished foods. It is still 
necessary to know what temperature you are cooking at, and the thermometers on 
most gas grills are worthless, even expensive grills, so I strongly recommend 
you buy a good digital oven thermometer and a good digital meat thermometer.

<p>Most gas grills use metal plates, lava rocks, and ceramics to radiate heat, 
so there are no open flames, no flareups, and cleanup is easier because drips 
are usually vaporized. There's no ash, so gassers are easier to clean, but they 
suffer from carbon and grease buildups that need to be scraped or pressure 
washed every few months. There are also gas jets and venturis that can clog up. 
Spiders seem to like it down in there, and I have even had to dig a wasp's nest 
out of one of the tubes once.Click here to read about how to clean, maintain, 
and troubleshoot your grill.</p> 
<p>Some people discard the lava rocks or ceramics every year. My 
brother-in-law makes the world's finest swordfish on a crappy old gas grill 
with lava rocks he has been using since they were harvested in the last ice 
age. Some of his lava rocks have begun to disintegrate and there are gaps where 
bare flame slips through to lick the meat. I have never been able to come close 
to his swordfish on all my fancy toys.</p> 
<p><strong>Accessories.</strong> Gas grills can come with a wider range of 
accessories. Most are set up so you can easily attach a rotisserie accessory 
and many come with side burners so you can keep sauces warm or cook side 
dishes. You can get night lights, side tables, spice racks, storage drawers, 
side burners, and there's probably even one with a DVD player.</p> 
<p><strong>Infrared and sear burners.</strong> The biggest problem with gas 
grills is that only the top end models get hot enough to get a steak crunchy on 
the exterior without overcooking the interior.If you like your steaks well 
done, gas grills are perfect for you. But if you like your meat crunchy on the 
outside and rare to medium rare on the inside, the temp at which it is most 
tender and juicy, then<em>most</em> gas grills just don't get the job done. The 
italicized word is &quot;most&quot;. Many of the more expensive gas grills now 
come with &quot;infrared&quot; burners off to one side. This is a bit of a 
misnomer because all grills cook by infrared, or heat, radiation. Infrared 
burners use a gas flame to superheat a ceramic or metal plate that radiates 
much more heat than standard burners. As much as twice the heat. In the 
700&deg;F plus range. That's the kind of temp that steakhouses cook at. It can 
give you those deep dark crusty steaks with red or pink interiors. Alas, most 
infrared burners are only big enough for one or two steaks at a time. Weber has 
its own technology for high heat searing. They call them sear burners, and they 
lie in a corner just below the grates. Char-Broil's new Quantum line has a 
radiation plate beneath the entire surface. My Quantum hits 680&deg;F about an 
inch above the grates.GrillGrates can be added to most any gas grill and can 
significantly improve the cooking characteristics.</p> 
<p>Infrared/sear burners may be perfect for steaks, but they are much too hot 
for direct heat cooking of most fish and veggies. Even with steaks, you need to 
keep an eye on food over direct infrared. They can incinerate in a hurry. 
Infrared burners can sometimes be used for rotisserie cooking and can even be 
used for indirect heat cooking.</p> 
<p><strong>Smoking.</strong> Some high end gas grills also have smoke boxes 
for wood chips, but for most gas grills you need to make foil packets or put 
pans of wood down under the cooking grate near the flame. Even though it is not 
recommended, I often throw aromatic woods right down near the burners on my 
Weber gas grill.</p> 
<p>Alas, most gas grill lids do not seal well, so a lot of the smoke is lost 
and more wood is needed than on a tighter grill.</p> 
<p><strong>Price.</strong> Because the mechanisms are more complex, gas grills 
tend to be more expensive than comparable charcoal grills, assembly of new gas 
grills is more complex than charcoal grills, and there are more parts to break 
and be replaced.</p> 
<p><strong>Two types of gas. </strong>With gas grills you have your choice of 
liquid propane or natural gas.</p> 
<p><strong>Liquid propane (LP) gas</strong> comes in 20 pound steel tanks. If 
you have an LP grill you should always have a full backup tank on hand. Nothing 
is more annoying than setting a chicken on the grill, cranking up the lawn 
mower, and returning in 30 minutes to discover that the tank ran out and the 
bird is raw.</p> 
<p>Propane gas is ideal for grills because, when pressurized, it compresses 
and turns to liquid, making it easy to store in tanks. It also contains more 
cooking energy than natural gas as measured in British Thermal Units (BTU). A 
BTU is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of 
water 1F. There are about 2,500 BTU in one cubic foot of propane and only about 
1,000 BTU in one cubic foot of natural gas.</p> 
<p>Gas grills typically range from 15,000 to 60,000 BTU per hour. 
Manufacturers tout the number of BTU their grills can produce, but the number 
can be very misleading.The number of BTU is not indicative of the heat it can 
generate. That must be calculated by<em>BTU per square inch</em>, something 
they never tell you. Higher BTU grills usually have more cooking surface over 
which the BTU are spread. Small grills can have as little as 5,000 BTU and 
large ones up to 60,000. Higher BTU grills use more fuel if you use all 
burners. 55-75 BTU/square inch is the typical range. Sideburners typically run 
10,000-15,000 BTU.</p> 
<p><strong>Natural gas</strong> is mostly methane. It must be delivered to the 
grill by a pipeline from your house so a certified contractor will be needed to 
do the installation and the grill must be parked in a permanent location. 
Propane grills cannot be hooked up to natural gas without an adapter kit and 
the regulator may need to be adjusted. Natural gas is cheaper than LP gas and 
you never have to worry about running out, unless you don't pay your gas bills.
</p> 
<h2>Which to buy?</h2> 
<p>Which to buy? I have both gas and charcoal. Almost all my birds, fish, 
veggies, pizzas, and breads go on my LP gas grills, almost all my red meats go 
on my charcoal grills. If you're starting out, and you want no fuss no muss, go 
gas. If you can afford it, get an infrared burner and a side burner.</p> 
<p>If you're willing to put in a bit more time to gain mastery of your tool, 
then go charcoal, and look for one that let's you raise and lower the coal.</p> 
<p>Or you could buy the Char-Griller Duo (right), which does both. It's a 
cheaply made grill, but I'll bet we see better duos in the future.</p> 
<p>Either way, before you make a purchase, read my article on How to Buy a 
Grill.</p> 
<p>I'm waiting for the sixto. Charcoal, wood, pellets, gas, infrared, and 
microwave! With a side burner!</p>

 AmazingRibs.com Best in BBQ Gold Medal Winners</h2> <strong>Here are 
some great products that have earnedThe</strong> <strong> AmazingRibs.com Best 
in BBQ Gold Medals. These are not ads!</strong> 
<p>Meat Temp Fridge Magnet</p> 
<p>The prize for Best BBQ Tool at the 2012 The National Barbecue Association 
conference went to a simple inexpensive fridge magnet by Meathead. It includes 
the latest USDA recommendations as well as chef recommendations (and they often 
differ) as well as color photos of the different stages of doneness for red 
meats. The temperatures are the same for both indoor and outdoor cooks.Click 
here for more info and how to order it.</p>

<h2>GrillGrates Take You To The Infrared Zone</h2> 
<p>GrillGrates are the best new product I have tested in years and the best 
thing to happen to beef since salt and pepper. The base superheats, eliminates 
hot spots, and blocks flareups. This is the concept behind the expensive new 
infrared grills. A must for gas grills.Click here for more about GrillGrates.
</p> <br>

<h2>The Smokenator: A Necessity For All Weber Kettles</h2> 
<p>If you have a Weber Kettle, you need the amazing Smokenator and Hovergrill. 
The Smokenator turns your grill into a first class smoker, and the Hovergrill 
can add capacity or be used to create steakhouse steaks.Click here to read more.
</p> 
<h2><strong>ThermoWorks Pocket Thermometer - No More Guessing</strong></h2> 
<p>A good thermometer is why I never serve overcooked or undercooked food. 
This one has a very thin tip with a tiny thermocouple so it gives an accurate 
reading in just six seconds. I cannot recommend it more highly. It will improve 
your cooking overnight and pay for itself in a hurry. And it is inexpensive.

<p>Steakhouse Knives</p> 
<p>These are the same knives used at the best steakhouses (Peter Luger, Smith 
&amp; Wollensky, Morton's and others). Machine washable, temper-ground, 
serrated, high-carbon stainless-steel, full-tang blades with excellent cutting 
edge retention, beefy hardwood handle, rust and stain resistant, and they stay 
shiny without polishing. And now they have the AmazingRibs.com imprimatur.Click 
here for more info on these wonderful knives.</p>
