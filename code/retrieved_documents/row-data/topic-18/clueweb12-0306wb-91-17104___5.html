<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  For years people have tried to combine the ease of 
gas with the flavor of charcoal. Sometimes it's a grill that converts from one 
to the other. This grill has three distinct chambers, a two burner gas grill, 
an equally sized charcoal grill and a side mounted firebox for smoking. 
Properly executed this sounds like a reasonable idea and I'm sure many people 
will buy this grill think this is the answer to all their needs. The problem 
is, this grill doesn't do a good job of any of these tasks. The two burner gas 
grill is limited in power and the air flow for smoking won't give you the kind 
of temperature control you need. Manufacturer's Site <br>

<h3>Guide Review - Brinkmann Triple Function Charcoal/Gas Smoker 810-3830-S
</h3>  This grill has been discontinued. There is no similar product. 
<p>The Brinkmann Triple Function grill will let you smoke ribs while you throw 
steaks on a charcoal fire and burgers over gas burners. Sounds like a versatile 
grill that provides for all your potential needs. The problem is, like most 
multifunction grills is that it doesn't do any of them well.</p> 
<p>On the gas grill side you get a dual burner cooking chamber that is low on 
power (24,000 BTUs under 341 square inches of cooking area). The burners are 
low quality stainless steel and the internal components are prone to rusting 
(as is much of this unit).</p> 
<p>On the charcoal grill side you get an adjustable cooking cooking grate so 
you can adjust the cooking temperature and a front mounted door so you can 
access the fire while cooking. This is a working configuration but, again, the 
components are not heavy enough to handle very high temperatures. The manual 
warns against using lighter fluid and instead recommends a charcoal chimney or 
self lighting charcoal. While this is good advice for anyone the reason is the 
risk of fire and damage to the grill.</p> 
<p>Mounted on the side of the grill is a firebox for you to build your fire 
for smoking. This allows the charcoal grill space to be turned into your 
smoking chamber. There is a cooking grate in the fire box so you can grill over 
charcoal while smoking, but when you lift the firebox lid you will loose smoke 
and heat in the smoking chamber. Air flow is controlled by awkward vents on the 
firebox, the grill hood, and in the partition separating the gas chamber from 
the charcoal chamber. The instructions say you need a fireproof glove to adjust 
the vents while cooking.</p> 
<p>The construction of this grill is lightweight and prone to rusting. You are 
asked to oil all parts of the grill and to very carefully maintain it to keep 
it in working condition.</p> Manufacturer's Site <br>
