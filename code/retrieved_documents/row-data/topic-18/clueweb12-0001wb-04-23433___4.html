<b>Charcoal</b>: Ask ten different industry experts why 
charcoal is making such a big comeback and you will get ten different answers. 
The reality is that the continued decline in quality of low priced gas grills 
is driving more and more people to the charcoal alternative. Sure, there are 
those after the more authentic flavor and experience, but the simple truth 
doesn&rsquo;t shed a positive light on the big box stores and their desire for 
a $100 gas grill.
<p>There is a shred of positive light on this trend however. With the 
introduction of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; lump charcoal and the placement of these 
products into stores likeWhole Foods people have been given the impression that 
charcoal cooking isn&rsquo;t bad for the environment or your health (at least 
not as bad as previously assumed). This is justifying the good old cookout, 
convincing more people to fire up charcoal for their grilling.</p> 
<p>Charcoal High End: For decades there has been one charcoal grill that has 
stood out as the pinnacle of charcoal grills.The Grillery Grillworks is going 
to run you between $2,000 and $3,000 depending on the model but is an amazing 
grill. This year The Grillery is being joined by theThe German Grill. This 
award winning design is a top quality charcoal grill that starts well over 
$1,000. In addition this year Cal-Spa has introduced acharcoal unit that looks 
like a conventional gas grill and can be mounted into one of Cal-Spa&rsquo;s 
outdoor kitchen units.Napoleon will also be introducing their own similar grill 
this year.</p> 
<p><b>Going Green</b>: One of the big buzz words in the outdoor cooking 
industry this years has been<i>Green Grilling</i>. According to HPBA a year of 
operating the average gas grill will burn through a little more than a barrel 
of oil per year. This fact has many grill makers talking up how few BTUs their 
grills have. FromFire Stones Cook Number grills and their maximum 30,000 BTU 
output to Char-Broil&rsquo;s new RED and its &ldquo;infrared efficiency&rdquo; 
(about 43,000 BTUs for 620 square inches). Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t a 
great deal of data to make a real educated decision yet about the best way to 
grill green. However, there are certainly a number of ways you can reduce your 
grill&rsquo;s carbon footprint:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Durability</b>: Manufacturing, packaging, shipping and recycling grills 
of any type causes a great deal of pollution. Buying products that last longer 
will reduce pollution. You will also spend less money in the long run.</li> 
<li><b>Gas Efficiency</b>: Grills that produce good heat with less fuel are 
always a better choice. You will use less fuel and save yourself some money. 
Look at the build of a grill. Inefficient gas grills have large opening in the 
back and rotisserie mountings. Also infrared generally uses less fuel and is 
worth looking into.</li> 
<li><b>Charcoal Efficiency</b>: A good charcoal grill can be shut down to put 
out the fire and save remaining charcoal for your next cookout. In this way you 
can greatly reduce your charcoal consumption. Avoid charcoal lighter fluids 
which are largely petroleum products. Use electric starter, charcoal chimneys 
or natural charcoal lighter instead.</li> 
<li><b>Buy only what you need</b>: There are a lot of grills out there 
offering a wide range of extra features. Rotisserie burners and infrared sear 
burners are becoming standard and grills with ovens and refrigerators are 
starting to increase. If you really don&rsquo;t need these features, save 
yourself some money and reduce the waste by getting the grill you need, not 
every bell and whistle.</li> 
<li><b>Clean your Grill</b>: A dirt grill creates more smoke and more 
pollution.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>Smokers</b>: While we continue to see Kamado style grills ( i.e. Big 
Green Egg) marketed more and more as smokers, one old fashioned smoker company 
is working to keep the good old barbecue pit alive. Barbecue legend Chris Marks 
and hisAce of Hearts Barbecue Specialties company is taking the classic Good 
One Smoker mainstream and looking to sell it nationally. This is a great smoker 
and with this kind of marketing might just become a national brand. Only time 
will tell if this gamble will pay off.<b>Barbecue Popularity</b>: For years 
everyone has reported the phenomenal growth in the popularity of barbecue. The 
real store this years is how this popularity is being taken advantage over. The
Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS) took on some professional marketing 
recently and will launch aNational Tour this year to promote barbecue. 
Interestingly enough, they are promising to demonstrate grilling and barbecue 
techniques. It would seem that old school barbecue is using grilling as the 
gateway to more barbecue fans and better business. </p> Previous
