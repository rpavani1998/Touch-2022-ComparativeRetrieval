<h1>Try These Hot Tips &amp; Techniques</h1> 
<p>Good cooking needs more than good recipes. The best chefs have developed 
tricks and techniques that can make major differences in the outcome. Here are 
some of my favorite tips and tricks that make cooking easier, and the outcome 
better. I am publishing them here with this request: If you improve upon them 
or have suggestions,pass them back to me.</p> 
<h2>Important stuff for all cooks</h2> 
<p>The importance of 2-zone and indirect cooking. The most important technique 
an outdoor cook needs to master is how to control the cooking temperature by 
using 2-zone and indirect heating. You need to control the temperature of your 
oven because the solids and liquids in the food react differently to different 
levels of heat.</p> 
<p>The thermodynamics of barbecue. You may have thought you left physics and 
chemistry behind when you left school, but if you want to eat well, you need to 
understand that cooking is all about physics and chemistry, with a little magic 
mixed in. Here are some broad concepts every outdoor cook needs to know.</p> 
<p>Seasoning and calibrating your grill. The first step to becoming a great 
outdoor cook is to master your instrument, and the best way to do this is to 
calibrate it with dry runs.<em>No food needed.</em><em> </em>When you are done 
with these dry runs, you want to know what to do when a recipe calls for 
cooking at 225&deg;F or 325&deg;F on the indirect side of the 2-zones and 
425&deg;F on the direct side.</p> 
<p>Grill cleaning and maintenance. Contrary to what your neighbor says, greasy 
grill grates and carbon buildup on the lid do not improve the flavor of your 
food. Rancid grease garnished with scale is not something I see on restaurant 
menus very often. And scale on the hood can reduce the heat of your grill. 
Here's how to clean and maintain your grill and smoker year round.</p> 
<p>Meat science. The basic concepts you need to understand in order to make 
Amazing Ribs, steaks, and other meats.</p> 
<p>Meat temperature guide. Here are the optimum serving temps. The best table 
you'll find anywhere.</p> 
<p>Do this before you start: Mise en place.<em> </em>It's French and it means, 
roughly, &quot;everything in its place&quot;, and it is the best thing from 
France since the Pinot Noir grape. It can prevent disasters. The basic concept 
is to get all the ingredients out and ready first. Chef Anthony Bourdain calls 
it his religion. The Boy Scouts have a similar motto: &quot;Be prepared&quot;.
</p> 
<p>The Stall. Beginners are often baffled after 2 to 3 hours of cooking pork 
shoulder or beef brisket. The temperature of the meat stops moving. It sticks. 
It stalls. and stays unyielding for hours. Here is an exclusive explanation by 
physicist Dr. Greg Blonder about what is happening and what to do about it.</p> 
<p>The Texas crutch. Boiling meat turns it to mush and sucks out all the 
flavor, but this technique makes it tender and juicy.</p> 
<p>Mythbustin': Is it true when they say &quot;If you're lookin', you ain't 
cookin'&quot;?It is a widely accepted shibboleth, appearing in practically 
every barbecue book ever written: &quot;If you're lookin', you ain't 
cookin'&quot;. The message is that when you open the lid of your grill or 
smoker, cooking slows or stops. Our resident mythbuster, Dr. Greg Blonder busts 
this myth.</p> 
<p>The Zen of charcoal. Here's what you need to know about cooking with 
hardwood, hardwood lump charcoal, charcoal briquets, and the new 
&quot;Competition Briquets&quot;.</p> 
<p>The Zen of wood. The seductive aroma and flavor of smoke is the essence of 
barbecue. Here's how to get it.</p> 
<p>Cooking More Than One Large Hunk o' Meat. When the whole fam damily is 
coming over, you might want to cook more than one pork butt or brisket, or a 
shoulder and a brisket and some ribs. If you have the space, it's no problem. 
The question is, how does this impact cooking times? But beware of those 
vertical rib holders.</p> 
<p>Keep your meat warm with a faux Cambro. The problem with outdoor cooking is 
that the temp isn't as easy to control as indoor cooking. So you can never be 
100% sure when things will be ready, especially when you're cooking low and 
slow. So here's the solution. Get it done early and hold it in a faux cambro, 
aka beer cooler.</p> 
<p>Freezing &amp; reheating leftover meats. I always cook more food than 
needed so nobody goes hungry. That means leftovers. Here's how to handle them.
</p> 
<p>Use a cooking diary. Take notes! Whenever you cook, keep a log. Make notes 
on the meat, the prep, the cooker temp, ambient temp, the wood you used, how it 
tasted, and what improvements you need to make. Here's a printable version of 
my cooking log.</p> 
<p>Glossary of terms. First, let's define some terms: What is barbecue? What 
are Amazing Ribs? How does it differ from grilling and smoking? What are baby 
backs, spares, country ribs, riblets, rib tips, rib roasts, and the St. Louis 
cut?</p> 
<p>Important weights, measures, and conversion tables. Sure, you know how many 
teaspoons in a tablespoon (don't you?), but do you know how many tablespoons in 
a cup?</p> 
<h2>Grill and smoker setups</h2> 
<p>Best setup for a gas grill. Yes, you can get real smoky, authentic tasting 
barbecue on a gas grill. Here's how.</p> 
<p>Best setup for a charcoal grill. Forget what the Weber folks say. Here's 
the best way to set up a charcoal grill for real barbecue.</p> 
<p>Best setup for an offset smoker (and modifications you can make). These 
popular smokers have some problems that can ruin your meal. Overcome them and 
you'll love the output. This article has tips for setting up a COS as well as 
hot to modify it.</p> 
<p>Best setup for a Weber Smokey Mountain and other charcoal bullet smokers. 
The WSM is one of the best backyard cookers available and the Brinkmann Bullet 
is another popular unit. Here's how to ignore the manual and set them up right.
</p> 
<p>Smokenator Setup &amp; Tips. The Smokenator may be the best accessory for 
the Weber Kettle ever, making it a very effective smoker, but there are some 
things I strongly disagree with in the Smokenator manual. Here are my tips for 
success.</p> 
<h2>Making Amazing Ribs</h2> 
<p>Are they ready yet? Perhaps the trickiest part of cooking ribs is knowing 
when they are ready, but not overcooked. Here's how.</p> 
<p>What are Amazing Ribs? The ribs the world loves best are from the American 
South, barbecued, with a perfect balance of porcine flavor, silky mouthfeel, 
springy texture, and juiciness framed by a kiss of smoke, hugged by the 
sweetness, acidity, and spiciness of sauce, and licked by fire. Here's my 
definition of what Amazing Ribs taste like.</p> 
<p>Saucing strategies. The most common error we make is adding the sauce at 
the wrong time. Here's how to get sizzling sauce without burning it.</p> 
<p>Skin 'n' trim: Removing the membrane. On the back of all slabs there's a 
membrane that keeps flavor from the meat and gets very tough. Here's how to 
remove it.</p> 
<p>Ribs in a hurry Memphis style. Use the Memphis method for cooking over 
direct heat and get them done in a hurry.</p> 
<h2>Safety first</h2> 
<p>Thawing meat. How to defrost meat safely.</p> 
<p>Food, knife, and grill safety. How to live to cook again and how to not 
kill your spouse, by accident that is.</p> 
<p>Does grilling pose a cancer risk? No. Not unless you do it badly. Read the 
facts.</p> 
<p>Do nitrites &amp; nitrates in hot dogs, pastrami, and lunch meats cause 
cancer? Read the facts.</p> 
<p>Why sprouts may be the riskiest food going. Eat all the raw veggies you 
like, but don't eat raw sprouts. Here's why they are different.</p>

<h1> Read this before posting a comment please:</h1> 
<p>1) If you are looking for info, please use the table of contents or the 
search box, at the top of every page.</p> 
<p>2) Don't ask me any questions that involve temp or time unless you tell me 
that you are using a digital thermometer! Bi-metal dial thermometers are often 
off by as much as 50&deg;F! If you are not using a good digital you have no 
idea what the temp really is so I can't help you. If you are still using a dial 
thermometer, please read this article about thermometers, then buy a good 
digital, and then, if the problem persists (chances are it won't), hit me with 
your questions.Then, please tell me <em>everything</em> I need to know to 
answer your question. Like the type of cooker you are using. Remember, I am not 
a mind reader.</p> 
<p>3) Please don't ask me &quot;What grill (or smoker) should I buy?&quot; 
Read myBuyer's Guides and the buying checklists and follow the links. I've 
shared just about everything I know. Pay attention to the awards I have given 
my faves. I cannot pick the right cooker for you any more than I could pick the 
right car or spouse for you.</p> 
<p>4) If you have problems posting with Internet Explorer, please read this. 
If problems persist,send me a note.</p>
