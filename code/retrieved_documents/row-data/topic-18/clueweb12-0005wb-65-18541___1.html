<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  Char-Griller has been making charcoal grills and 
smokers for a few years. Recently they introduced a small 3-burner gas grill. 
This charcoal/gas combo is exactly what it sounds like, a combination of 
Char-griller's gas and smallest charcoal grills mounted on a single frame. If 
you are in the market for both gas and charcoal grilling (or you can't decide 
which way to go) this is a unit to take a look at. Typically selling for $300 
to $400USD this isn't an expensive combination unit and with over 1200 square 
inches of cooking space it is a very large grill, though you probably will only 
use one side at a time. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Inexpensive gas/charcoal combo</li> 
<li>Can be used as a smoker if you buy the optional side smoker box</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Lower quality gas grill components</li> 
<li>Lightweight construction</li> </ul> 
<h3>Description</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>One 438 square inch charcoal cooking chamber</li> 
<li>One 438 square inch 3-burner, 40,800 BTU maximum output gas cooking chamber
</li> 
<li>1260 square inches of total grilling space</li> 
<li>12,000 BTU brass capped side burner under a flush mounted lid</li> 
<li>AA battery electronic igniters</li> 
<li>Porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates</li> 
<li>Barrel shaped thermal painted steel body and lid</li> 
<li>Hood mounted thermometers on each cooking chamber</li> 
<li>Propane tank and cover sold separately</li> 
<li>Made in China by Char-Griller (A&amp;J Mfg) and sold through several 
retailers</li> </ul> 
<h3>Guide Review - Char-Griller Duo Gas/Charcoal Grill Model #5050</h3>  The 
Char-Griller Duo is a combination of theirChar-Griller Grillin Pro Gas Grill 
and a smaller version of their popular charcoal grills. This gives you a 
3-burner gas grill and a similar sized charcoal grill mounted on a single frame 
with a 12,000 BTU side burner on the side. If you spend the extra money of the 
offset firebox you can use this unit as a smoker as well.
<p>The question you have to ask yourself is, do you really want two grills 
bolted together? If this works for you then this is a grill to consider at 
since it sells at some locations for around $300USD (try Lowes Home Improvement 
Stores) it won't put you out that much. Of course with more parts you have more 
to go wrong with it and since the gas grill side relies on some lightweight 
components you might end up with a working charcoal grill attached to a failed 
gas grill.</p> 
<p>The gas grill side is a nearly 40,800 BTU 3-burner gas grill with medium 
weight porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates. While some of these 
components are not the best quality they are pretty good for the price. The BTU 
output is a little low for the size, but the barrel shape and thicker steel 
body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power. The 
attached side burner is powerful enough to heat a good sized pot though the 
mounting is a little weak so you can't put a lot of weight on it. Other than 
this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.</p> 
<p>On the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill. The 
cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom 
holds in the heat and protects the painted finish. If you add on the optional 
offset firebox you can use this charcoal grill as a smoker. While relatively 
small this charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is 
limited in indirect grilling space.</p> <br>

<strong>BAD 
Customer Service</strong>, Member pndxtr1 
<p>After spending HUNDREDS on this &quot;&quot;dual&quot;&quot; monstrosity, 
and spending 2 hours assembling it, I find that it is missing a part of the 
igniter. Numerous calls to their &quot;&quot;customer service&quot;&quot; Dept. 
AND their CORPORATE office yielded nothing more than uncaring people who found 
a need to explain their idiotic procedure that requires a week to send out a 
one-ounce part costing 50 cents. Imagine it something REALLY important was 
missing! Beware of this company! I probably won't purchase one of their items 
again, after this frustrating customer service experience. PS......If you MUST 
have this grill, shop around! This grill is being dumped on the market by Lowes 
and others for $225, not the $399 or $499 MSRP. Other reviews regarding rust, 
dripping, and other issues are reported on other reviews of this grill.</p>
