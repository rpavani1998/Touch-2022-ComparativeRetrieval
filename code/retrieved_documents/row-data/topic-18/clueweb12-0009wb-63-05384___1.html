<h2>Transcript:How to Use a Charcoal Grill</h2>Hi, I am Ben Kurtzman for 
About.com Food, and today I am going to show you some tips for charcoal 
grilling. A lot of people like using a gas grill because it is so quick and 
easy, but charcoal grills offer a distinct flavor and are really quite simple.
<br> 
<h3>Charcoal Grill Safety</h3>When you buy charcoal briquettes, you can get 
ones that are already soaked in lighter fluid. These are the easiest and the 
simplest to get lit. In the interest of safety, make sure your grill is settled 
on a nonflammable surface. Also, make sure it is not near anything that could 
catch fire.<br>

<h3>Starting the Grill</h3>Begin by stacking your briquettes in a pyramid. If 
your grill has air vents, open then up. This will increase airflow and help 
your charcoal burn better. Using matches, light the pyramid of briquettes in 
several places. After about ten or fifteen minutes the flames will die down and 
the charcoal will become gray with ash. Spread the charcoal out, and put the 
grill rack back on. Once the grilling rack is in place, use a grill brush to 
make sure it is clean.<br>

<h3>Testing the Grill Heat</h3>You can test the heat of the fire by placing 
your hand about six inches above the coals. If it is only comfortable to keep 
your hand there for a second or two, you are grilling with very high heat. If 
you can keep you hand there for five or six seconds, this is medium heat, and 
anything longer is low. Most of the time you will be able to cook without the 
grill cover, however, if you want to increase the heat, covering the grill is a 
quick way to do that.<br>
<br>
Now that you know the basics of charcoal 
grilling, try it with different vegetables and meats. It will provide a 
different flavor than gas grilling, and it is not very complicated.<br>
