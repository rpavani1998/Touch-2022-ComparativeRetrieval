<h1>Charcoal Grills: Reviews</h1> Updated June 2011 <br>
 Not all charcoal 
grills are created equally and since they certainly take more effort than gas 
counterparts, the end result better be worth it. We were disappointed to find 
very limited professional reviews for this subject and therefore had to rely 
mostly on user feedback and reviews to make our top recommendations.<br>

<h2>Budget charcoal grill</h2> <strong>Weber One-Touch Silver</strong> <br>

*Est. $70 to $90 Compare Prices <br>

<p></p> 
<p> Reviewers say the Weber One-Touch Silver kettle grill is the best budget 
charcoal grill, thanks to its proven design, efficient heating and convenient 
cleaning system, which is what gives the grill its name. Ashes are&hellip; 
expanddirected into a removable tray for easy clean-up. This feature, as well 
as the 10-year warranty on the exterior (one year for the grates) and 24-hour 
customer service, helps make the Weber One-Touch Silver one of the most 
user-friendly grills available. It's offered in two sizes: 363 square inches 
(*Est. $90) and 240 square inches (*Est. $70). collapse</p> See Our Full Review

<h2>Best charcoal grill overall</h2> <strong>Weber Performer</strong> <br>

*Est. $330 Compare Prices <br>

<p></p> 
<p> The Weber Performer is the most widely praised charcoal grill in reviews. 
It combines the functional details and excellent customer service standard of 
less expensive Weber grills with add-on features such as a worktable,&hellip; 
expandbuilt-in thermometer, lid catcher and storage areas. Reviewers are very 
impressed with the Weber Performer's most unusual feature, a gas ignition 
system. Thanks to this, they say, the Performer blends the convenience of a gas 
grill with the cooking characteristics of charcoal grilling that grilling 
purists love. The Weber Performer is available in one size only -- 22.5 inches 
in diameter -- but three different exterior colors are offered. collapse</p>

<p>Today: Lou Manfredini recommends the Weber Performer in this brief guide, 
though mentioning its gas-lighting system is the extent of his description.</p> 
<p>Amazon.com: More than 300 user reviews are available at Amazon.com (there 
are separate listings of this grill in different colors and from different 
vendors); they give the Performer an essentially perfect average overall rating.

score of 4.8 out of 5.</p>

<h2>Barrel-style charcoal grill</h2> <strong>Char-Griller Outlaw</strong> <br>

*Est. $150 Compare Prices <br>

<p></p> 
<p> Barrel-style charcoal grills are ideal for cooking large amounts of food 
at one time, and the Char-Griller Outlaw features a 1,000-square-inch cooking 
surface, making it an excellent choice for a family gathering or&hellip; expand
backyard party. In addition to durable steel construction, a powder-coat finish 
and cast-iron grilling surfaces, the Outlaw is kitted out with a number of 
accessories, including multiple shelves, a wooden worktable, warming rack and 
thermometer. An optional side firebox is available if you'd like to use your 
Outlaw as a smoker. For cooking smaller portions, however, the Char-Griller 
Outlaw may be unwieldy. The Char-Griller Smokin' Pro (*Est. $200) is nearly 
identical save for a smaller cooking area (830 square inches), and it includes 
a side fire box. collapse</p> See Our Full Review <br>

<h2>Portable charcoal grill</h2> <strong>Weber Smokey Joe</strong> <br>
*Est. 
$30 to $35 Compare Prices <br>

<p></p> 
<p> Compact tailgating and camping grills generally draw mixed reviews, but 
the Weber Smokey Joe Silver (*Est. $30) gets more consistent feedback than 
most. With a 14.5-inch-diameter cooking space, the Smokey Joe is large&hellip; 
expandenough to grill for a small group. Its short legs offer plenty of 
support, provided the grill is on a level surface. Like the Weber One-Touch, 
this portable Weber charcoal grill is backed by a 10-year warranty on the 
exterior and a one-year warranty on the grates. The Smokey Joe Gold retails for 
around $35 and adds a lid lock. Both Weber Smokey Joe portable grill models get 
excellent user reviews. collapse</p> See Our Full Review <br>

<h2>Luxury charcoal grill</h2> <strong>The Big Green Egg (Large)</strong> <br>

*Est. $750 Learn More <br>

<p></p> 
<p> This Kamado-style grill isn't the biggest on the market, but what it lacks 
in space it makes up for in versatility and temperature control. Its sealed 
ceramic chamber can cook at an incredibly high heat or at low&hellip; expand
temperatures for long periods without needing new coals. This gives grillers 
the option to sear or slow-cook meats. The Big Green Egg's exterior stays cool 
even when grilling at temperatures as high as 750 degrees Fahrenheit. Critics 
say it can be fragile, however, and the Big Green Egg Company only offers its 
lifetime warranty for grills purchased from licensed dealers (not online). You 
can buy the Big Green Egg in four other sizes -- mini, small, medium and extra 
large -- ranging in price from around $250 to over $1,000. collapse</p> See Our
