<h2>charcoal smoker vs gas smoker</h2> 
<p> by Lisa <br>
(Staten Island, NY) </p> 
<p> Hi, I just bought my husband a charcoal smoker for his birthday; we,re all 
about grilling and deepfrying turkey and want to spread our wings. As beginners 
should we have started off with propane? I thought we'd get better flavor from 
a charcoal one, am I way off?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help!<br>

 Depends on 
how much time you have. If your like me and are on the run all the time, the 
electric smoker fits my needs. don't usually have to watch temps that much. <br>
