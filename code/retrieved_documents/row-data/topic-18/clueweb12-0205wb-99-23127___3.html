<h1>More than a Gas Grill &mdash; Cook with Any Combination of Charcoal, Wood 
and Gas on a Kalamazoo Hybrid Grill</h1> 
<p>Kalamazoo invented hybrid grilling technology, and to this day there is no 
other grill that so seamlessly combines the capabilities of a gas grill and a 
charcoal grill. Kalamazoo Dragon Burners&trade; deliver over 115 BTUs of 
grilling power to each square inch of the primary grilling area, so these are 
seriously capable gas grills.</p> 
<p>Above the burners are the Hybrid Fire Grilling Drawers. For gas grilling, 
simply fire up the grill. For charcoal or wood grilling, place some charcoal or 
wood in the drawers. The burners can be used to quickly and easily start the 
fire and then turned off, or they can be used throughout cooking to provide the 
heat while a handful of wood chunks lend all the flavor of an open wood fire.

<h2> Why choose between a wood grill, a charcoal grill and a gas grill when 
you can enjoy a Kalamazoo Hybrid Grill and have the best of all worlds?</h2> 
<p>For years the argument has raged on about charcoal and wood versus gas 
barbecues. Which is better? Wood imparts flavor that gas on its own will not, 
and gas offers convenience that wood or charcoal can't match. Rather than 
joining the argument, we've engineered a solution&hellip; our exclusive and 
revolutionary<strong> Hybrid Fire Grilling Drawer System.</strong></p> 
<p>Kalamazoo's revolutionary hybrid grilling system enables the serious 
outdoor gourmet to conveniently use any combination of wood, charcoal or gas on 
one stainless steel hybrid grill.</p> 
<p>Load <strong>charcoal</strong> or <strong>wood</strong> into the drawers 
above the powerful cast stainless steel<strong>gas burners</strong> and the 
grill is ready for flavorful solid fuel grilling. Or simply fire up the burners 
for gas-only cooking. Either way, cleanup is a breeze with our deep-hopper 
clean out system that funnels down to a deep, stainless steel pan.</p> 
<p>No other grill so seamlessly combines the convenience of a gas grill with a 
high-performance charcoal and wood grill. If you like the flavor of foods 
cooked with an open wood flame, a Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet Hybrid Grill may be 
right for you.</p> 
<p>Hybrid grills are available in built-in and free-standing designs, and can 
be specified as part of acustom outdoor kitchen. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>How the hybrid grill drawers work: </h3> 
<p>Each pair of hybrid grill drawers includes one drawer for gas grilling and 
one for charcoal or wood grilling.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Kalamazoo K450 Series Hybrid grill models use a single drawer that covers 
the entire cooking area.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Kalamazoo K900 Series Hybrid grill models use a pair of drawers in a 
side-by-side configuration.</p> </li> </ul>
