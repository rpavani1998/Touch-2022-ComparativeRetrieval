 Bad Cover <br>
 This cover is 
almost worthless. The bottom is so high that rain bounces off the patio and 
gets into the bottom compartment via the vents. Now my INTERIOR bottom shelf is 
rusted! Also this cover has a VENT running along the middle of the cooking 
compartment. This 3&quot; wide, 2' long VENT lets in rain, dust, dirt, crud, 
and everything else floating through the air. As I said, this cover is 
WORTHLESS. Weber, the company that touts itself as the premier grill company 
cannot even make a decent grill cover. I'm buying something else next time. Oh, 
and by the way, the $49.00 burners wore out in a year. Just like the $100.00 
grill I bought 15 years ago from Ace.  Cons: Poor Construction, Poor Value, 
Hard To Clean, Hard To Use <br>

 NO HEADLINE AT THIS TIME <br>
 THIS PRODUCT 
WAS NOT INSPECTED BY QUALITY CONTROL. OR IF INSPECTED - SOMEONE'S NOT DOING 
THEIR JOB. ONE SIDE OF THE COVER WAS NOT STITCHED PROPERLY. I HAD TO SEW THE 
SIDE ON MY SEWING MACHINE. I DIDN'T WANT TO RETURN - BECAUSE IT WAS A EASY FIX 
FOR ME.  Pros: Durable, Perfect Fit <br>

 Did 
not fit as well as told<br>
 The cover is well designed just needed to be 
bigger as a very tight fit which makes it hard to take on and off for grilling. 
 Pros: Durable <br>
 Cons: Did not fit very well <br>
 Best Uses: Barbeque <br>
