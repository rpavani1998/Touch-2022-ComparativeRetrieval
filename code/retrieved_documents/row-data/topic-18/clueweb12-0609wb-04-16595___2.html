<h2>A Man and His Grill...</h2> 
<p>I look forward to summer for many reasons, and cooking outside is just 
about at the top of that list. When I cook at home in the summer, I use my 
grill to make a great piece of fish, steak, chicken or chop that has the same 
quality and flavor that Wildfire produces. It's just me, my meat of choice and 
my grill. Oh, and of course, an ice cold beer!</p> 
<p>There are things that can be done with a grill beyond just quickly cooking 
food (direct grilling). Grills can be used to slow roast (indirect grilling) 
and smoke food as well. I enjoy experimenting with different techniques for 
cooking on the grill, and have created some of myfavorite meals this way.</p> 
<p>There's always that age old debate: gas or charcoal? Here are some of the 
differences between them:</p> 
<p><strong>Charcoal grill advantages:</strong></p> 
<p>Charcoal burns hotter</p> 
<p>Smoking is generally easier on a charcoal grill</p> 
<p>You get to build a fire!</p> 
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p> 
<p>They require more work and attention to light up, keep lit and hold 
temperature</p> 
<p><strong>Gas grill advantages:</strong></p> 
<p>Push a button and viola - you're ready to grill. Easy!</p> 
<p>Consistent and steady heat</p> 
<p>Less mess</p> 
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p> 
<p>Charcoal gives a certain flavor to food, gas does not</p> 
<p>Smoking is not always as easy/effective on a gas grill, although the newer 
gas grills are getting better and better</p> 
<p>You don't get to build a fire...</p> 
<p>So Father's Day is coming up, and it has me thinking about upgrading my 
grill. There is a great store in Wilmette, IL called The Backyard BBQ Store. 
This store has everything a master griller could want or need. What really 
appeals to me is that they actually let you 'test drive' the grills. Sometime 
over the next few weeks I'll be bringing in some protein and vegetables to 
grill at their outdoor test kitchen so I can see which one works best for me. I 
won't forget the beer!</p> 
<p>I will report back with my findings as soon as the last piece of meat comes 
off the grill...</p>
