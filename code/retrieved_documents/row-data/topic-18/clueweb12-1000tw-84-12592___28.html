<h1>Battle of the Barbeque: Charcoal vs. Gas</h1> 
<p>It's the great debate in grilling: charcoal or gas.</p> 
<h4>Related Links</h4> 
<ul>

<li>Burgers on the Grill</li> 
<li>More Recipes for the Grill</li> </ul> 
<p>For most masters of the grill, there is no compromising; you are either in 
one camp or the other. Let's look at the issues that are inflaming the debate.
<br><br>
</p> 
<h2>Gas Grilling</h2> 
<p><br>
Gas-fired grilling has the clear benefit of being extremely 
convenient. Simply turn a knob, and say hello to your highly adjustable heat 
source. Gas grills are fueled by liquid propane stored in refillable tanks.<br>

</p> 
<p>Gas grilling is clean and quick. There's no messing with briquettes, no 
stacking, no lighting, no smelly starter fluid and no waiting around for the 
coals to glow. And once dinner is over, there's no ashy mess to clean up. 
Return the switch to off, rub a metal brush over the grate and clean-up time is 
over.</p> 
<p>On the technical side, gas burns clean, but it doesn't impart much flavor 
to grilled foods.<br>
<br>
See our <em>Complete Barbeque and Grilling Recipe 
Collection</em>. </p> 
<h2><br>
Charcoal Grilling<br>
</h2> 
<p><br>
Charcoal grilling might not offer the same level of convenience as 
gas, but it does boast one benefit that stands out above all others: smoke 
flavor. The dry, white-hot heat of charcoal sears meat quickly, creating a 
crusty, caramelized exterior and smoky flavor.<br>
</p> 
<p>Of course, charcoal grilling requires more time and attention than gas, 
from building and lighting the briquettes to waiting for the coals to get hot 
to managing the flame. Since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals, 
it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas 
without briquettes). These cool spaces allow for better control, letting you 
sear food first over the hot spots before transferring it to cooler parts to 
finish cooking.</p> 
<p>Charcoal grills are also less expensive than gas grills, though the cost of 
charcoal will add up over the years. Charcoal is also more portable than gas 
grills. A bag of charcoal can easily be chucked into the car and taken to the 
park or beach.</p> 
<p>And let's face it--charcoal also involves an enticing element of danger. 
Playing with fire is fun. (Of course, this can be a plus or minus, depending on 
who's behind the flame.)</p> 
<p>See our <em>Tips for Successful Grilling.</em></p> 
<h2><br>
The Verdict<br>
</h2> 
<p><br>
Ultimately, any determination of what's best comes down to 
considerations of convenience, cost, flavor and practicality. If you have a 
tiny patio, a massive gas grill just won't work. Great grilling can be had over 
either gas or charcoal flames.<br>
<br>
So now that we've settled that, what's 
the barbeque capital of the world?&nbsp;We break&nbsp;it down in<em>Dueling 
Barbeques</em>. &nbsp;<br>

 Charcoal 
Seems to be Best, Love the Smoky Flavor but I know it has Hazards such as the 
Chemical in the lighting fluid will also ruin the BBQ if not properly burned off

 use a 
chimaney to light the charcoal thers no fluid flavor throw a piece of dried 
hard wood or any fruit wood and you have extar layer of flavor just don't over 
do it play with your fire learn to cook indirectly and you have wonderful 
grilled juicy pork with a nice smokey flavor you can do all that with a gas 
grill also but you don't get to play with firei like lump charcoal and wood bot 
i also understand and am ok with other people using gas time, convience, ease 
just include your kids spouse and get off the coauch and get outside that big 
orange thing in the sky is very soothing to the soul <br>

 Having cooked over a 
campfire for years, I prefer the taste of the charcoal grill, but with a 
family, I've settled for the convenience of a gas grill. When cooking over 
charcoal though, I've NEVER used ligher fluid. The flavor gets into the food 
and ruins it. You can get charcoal irons, which turn red hot, and are designed 
for lighting the charcoal. There are several Boy Scout tricks which work well 
too. Melt paraffin wax in a double boiler. Take strips of newspaper about an 
inch and a half to two inches wide. Roll them up adding more strips of paper 
until it's about half to three quarters of an inch thick, and tie with candle 
wick leaving an extra 2 inches of wick. Dip in the wax 3-4 times for 5-10 
seconds, making sure to get the extra wick too without getting your fingers in 
the wax. Use 4-5 of these in your charcoal pile, 2 should be plenty if you 
stack the charcoal in a chimney. Light the wick. The other way is to save the 
lint from your dryer and put it into the paper-type egg cartons. Fill the 
carton with melted wax and let cool. Cut each egg section apart, use only 2-3, 
lighting the egg of the egg carton. No more smelly lighter fluid, no more 
lighter fluid tasting food. <br>

 I learned (by mistake/trial and error, whatever you 
want to call it) a great way to add flavor without putting wood in with the 
charcoal, yet still using it. I had some untreated oak boards that had been cut 
to appx. 12&quot; x 12&quot; laying around and was cooking pork ribs on my 
kettle-style grill. I needed to control the temperature of heat better than 
just moving the pile to one half and placing the meat over the less intense 
side (I usually put the &quot;pyramid&quot; towards the hinge/back area leaving 
the front/handle area free of charcoal). I decided to use one of my boards 
(again, NOT TREATED, I didn't wanna go poisoning anyone) to prop the lid open 
(it looked like a giant Pac-Man) to desired height by using the board as a 
wedge. I only put the board in about 3&quot; and the other 9&quot; were hanging 
out. When it is wedged against the lid, it can be slid front-to-back or 
side-to-side to create a wider or narrower opening, helping to control 
temperature. What did I learn? Not only does this help with the temperature 
control, but the wood will SMOKE!!! and therefore add more flavor. Since I have 
learned this, I have tried several different woods/boards, and each time the 
food (as spiced or not) always tastes great and different. I promise if you use 
this method, your grilled meat will never taste the same twice, and will always 
be great. <br>

 While 
I personally have never grilled, I do know a great trick that my grandpa taught 
me. One day, while at his house, we decided to have hamburgers for lunch. It 
was nice out, so we cooked them on the grill and ate at the table outside with 
my grandma and brother. My grandpa has a gas grill, so in order to get a little 
bit of a smoky flavor, he had a small tin or aluminum tray that had wood chips 
in it. I'm sorry that I don't know what kind of wood it was, but it adds a very 
light flavor that was hardly noticeable since the burgers were full of 
seasonings. I assume it would be nice with other meats. I suppose gas is easier 
but there's nothing like playing with fire. I learned that both in science 
class, with a particular classmate who likes making battery acid eat through 
foil, and on girl scout campouts with toast on a stick. <br>

 I use lava rocks in my gas grill 
so I get the convenience of gas but a great grilled, smokey taste. I grill all 
year round (even in the snow) so about once a year I swap out half the lava 
rocks for fresh ones thus retaining that seasoned flavor all the time. The lava 
rocks also help when doing long, slow grilling... for extra flavor just 
sprinkle a few hickory or mesquite wood chips on the rocks. <br>

 bad news about that charcoal is 
its made with petroleum (oil that is in your car's fuel) which cooks into your 
food :(. I highly recommend finding a &quot;charcoal&quot; that is free from 
oil. I find it at my home depot :) <br>

 I have both a gas 
grill and a charcoal grill and when it come to one of my favorite thinks to do 
cooking on a grill I have to say that charcoal is the way to go. Charcoal give 
food a flavor that can't be beat. Cooking on a gas grill is easier but is like 
cooking indoors. I built me a brick charcoal grill a few years back and I love 
it. I barely ever use my gas grill. Any way you like just keep on grillin'. <br>

 Gas 
Grill? Only if I have to. Charcoal/open flame purist, what can I say. Clean the 
grates, but never the inside, just get it really hot now and again. <br>

 I started grilling with 
charcoal lighting with a chimaney to lose the flavor of the lighter fluid but I 
found that some of the flavor I wanted to lose was in the charcoal it self. So 
I tried to cover it up by mixing cherry wood chips in with the charcoal which 
worked some what but not fully. So now I light the cherry wood chips in the 
chimaney, it takes a bit longer to get ready and you have to keep an eye on it 
so it doesn't flare up. I think that this is the best way to get a full smoked 
flavor it what ever you are cooking, and the lower cooking temp. prevents you 
from cook pork ribs to fast. Oh and I have both a Gas and Charcoal grill and 
I've only used the Gas grill 2 times (for nights I was short on time but didn't 
want to have a box pizza) in the past year, because you just can get the flavor 
in a Charcoal grill with its coals, wood chips, or mix of both <br>

 I cook using a California Kamado and never have I tasted 
better barbecue than what i get now and I'm using lump charcoal to fuel my 
kamado. All of the major kamado brands recommend using lump charcoal simply 
because it provides the best tasting barbecue. After all, isn't a better taste 
what we are a looking for when cooking outdoors? Since it is all about taste, 
charcoal and especially lump charcoal is the logical winner. <br>
<br>

 I have both. Charcoal is superior in 
my opinion. I would agree that hardwood lump charcoal is the best, but 
honestly, Im not sure briquttes are that much worse. I know, I 
know...SACRILGE(spelling?). I always have both briquettes and lump on hand. I 
have recently aquired (for a sweet deal...nothin' sucka) a weber genesis silver 
LP grill. It's really nice, but I dont ever use it. My better half even prefers 
charcoal. I light it up, hang out in the back yard with our daughter, its an 
event , its awesome. I just always find an excuse to go charcoal baby. <br>

 Since I am considered the 
grill master at our house, my father always insisted that grilling isn't 
grilling without the charcoal. He was given a gas grill for 1 fathers day. He 
then &quot;re-gifted&quot; it to my uncle! When grilling lamb he would toss 
dried oregano or a couple fresh sprigs of rosmary on the hot coals which gave 
the lamb an awesome flavor. I still use his grilling tricks today. I have to 
agree with most, Oak charcoal is good, as is apple wood or pecan. Plus you can 
always smoke your meats. Something you can't do in your gas grill. Grill on and 
Cheers!! <br>

when were out of lighter fluid my husband got the bottle of used vegetable oil 
we had and poured over the charcol and some paper and it lit the fire just like 
the lighter fluid. now we save all our coking oil for this and have never 
bought lighter fluid again. also you don't have to endure that nasty lighter 
fluid smell !!! <br>
<br>
 &nbsp; KuddlKat&nbsp; <br>

<br>  Instead of lighter fluid, make a makeshift starter with empty cardboard 
egg cartons, dryer lint and candle wax. Pack each egg section of the carton 
with the dryer lint and pour in melted candle wax so the lint soaks it up. 
Allow it to cool and solidify, then tear apart the 12 &quot;starters&quot;. Set 
a few of these starters and light the cardboard carton. The lint is extremely 
flammable and the wax keeps the starters from burning out too quickly. I 
haven't noticed any candle wax leftovers so it seems to all burn off, but I've 
heard you can do this without the wax also although I haven't tried it like 
that. We have a large smoker (recycled), and cook with select scrap wood we 
find through the year. Pain in the butt to control the temps, but it's cheap so 
we can spend more on better foods. <br>

 I've grilled in the rain and in temps 
over 100 degrees. Nothing beats the coals. I like add wood to the coals and 
soaked wood chips for added smoke. I do use a deluxe smoker that utilizes 
propane gas, however there is a cast iron wood box that sits over the flame 
that admits the greatest smoke ever. It's not about the work, its about the 
flavor. <br>

I've used both charcoal and gas grills. I prefer the convenience and ease of 
gas grilling over the charcoal grill, especially when entertaining. If you 
season your foods right you dont miss any of the smoked wood flavor at all. 
Anywho, cheers and happy grilling! <br>

 I love charcoal grilling but instead of messing 
around with the lighter fluid I buy the instant light charcoal yes it is more 
expensive but you don't have the lighter fluid taste. <br>

 We have a gas grill, large charcoal 
kettle and dedicated smoker, and all 3 get heavy use in our catering business. 
If you said I had to have only one, the gas grill wins hands down, no contest. 
It simply comes down to anything you can do I can do better. I will use the 
example of steak to show why I feel this way. Steak is one of the easiest 
things to cook and one of the hardest for many to cook properly. Before we talk 
about flavor and taste, let's talk about accuracy. At the high temps needed for 
a quality sear, you can overcook a steak in seconds. I have a Tel-tru on my gas 
grill that has proven to be accurate over years of use, so I know when it says 
700 that's what it means. The entire grill is at that temp, I used surface 
thermometers to check it and it's very uniform in all but the back corners that 
I don't use much anyway, and certainly not for steak. When I put several 
hundred dollars worth of prime beef on the grill, I can't afford to guess at 
the cooking times, I need to know for sure. Only gas or electric heat is going 
to provide that level of accuracy, I'm sorry charcoalies, but it's the truth 
and you know it. As for flavor, that's another story. If it's char flavor you 
want, put a few charcoal bricks in the wood holder of your gas grill. They 
won't affect the temp much, especially if they are just started and not half 
way burned. The thermometer doesn't lie, if they add a few degrees of heat turn 
the gas down a tad. If you want true smoke flavor, use some wood chunks 
instead. Again, you have a reliable and instantly changeable, regulated by you 
heat source, so your temps will stay very tight and your steaks (or whatever 
you cook)will be uniform, even from week to week. So let's try the arguments 
against gas. It can't smoke. Bull. Get a pellet pistol, set your gas to barely 
on (around 180 or so) lay out that brisket or Boston butt and go to bed. 8 
hours later when you get up, open your grill to perfectly smoked, fall off the 
bone bbq. Try that with charcoal, it can't be done. Everyone knows the best 
smokers have electric heat, visit Cookshack's website to see why they are the 
only type banned from competion cookoffs. Now I understand that I'm looking at 
this from a food service viewpoint, and what I need from my grill may be 
different than for others. I also realize that super high temps are dangerous, 
even scary, but consider this. The griddle at some restaurants can exceed 1500 
degrees surface temp. Searing alone at that temp produces the char flavor, no 
coals needed. And last but not least, for those who have paid over $50 for a 
raw steak, no explanation is needed. For those who have not, none will do it 
justice. Suffice to say this, anything that alters the flavor of that meat 
except a good char is not welcome. Keep the wood, coals, A1 etc, just give me a 
sharp knife and a fork, please. And something that runs on gas or electricity 
to cook it with. <br>

 I just finished eating a rib eye stead. I had 
the choice to light the gas grill or take a few extra minutes and light some 
charcoal. I did the charcoal route and the taste is so much better. I might add 
that there is no need to buy and use charcoal lighter fluid. I have a charcaol 
chimney that I bought, You was a few sheets of newspaper in the bottom, add 
charcoal, light and then wait about 25 minutes. It is all ready to go, it sure 
is worth the extra 5 minutes for the flavor you get. Please try it. <br>

 I never cooked on a gas grill, never had anything cooked on a gas 
grill, and don't think I want to eat anything cooked on a gas grill. Charcoal 
is the way to go hands down. <br>

 I have cooked on everything imaginable, my famous ribs, pork 
steaks, brisket have been on gas, charcoal, wood smoke. They all come out good 
but charcoal &amp; wood has been far the best, quoted from different guest whom 
I have entertained. But I still enjoy cooking on various units. <br>

 I have grilled for 
many years and initially i would use briquette and lighter fluid, until I 
discover a charcoal chimney.This is the best way to grill using charcoal and it 
gives your food a better flavor and no worries about carcengens that might 
result from using the lighter fluid. <br>

 I used charcoal for years and liked it. Then I bought a 
large gass grill with a smoker tray on the side. It's the cat's whiskers. Just 
add dry apple chips or your fav type wood and turn it up. In 15 min your grill 
is hot enough to sear meat and the wood is smoking like crazy. My grill has 3 
large burners so after I sear the meat I cut one of the outer burners off and 
move the meat to that side and turn the other two down and let the meat cook 
sow and slow. I may add wood chips in 30 min or so by pulling the chip tray out 
and adding what I want then push the tray back in. I could not do that with my 
old charcoal grill. I still have a charcoal smoaker that I use once in a while 
but I will never give up my gas grill. The main thing is, use what you like, 
don't listen to nay sayers and enjoy cooking out of doors. Happy grillin 
everyone! <br>

As far as I am concerned there is only one way to go, and that is charcoal. I 
do use lighter fluid, and i like that taste. could be cause my dad used it ALOT 
when i was little in our back yard BBQ. But i do agree it is better, for the 
food, to use a hot iron. Bottom line, if you dont care about taste use gas, if 
you do use charcoal. <br>

your Thanksgiving turkey on the grill for years and that always comes out juicy

 They sell charcoal starter chimneys at Walmart and online at many 
other sites. You put the charcoal in the top of the chimney, then put two 
pieces of crumpled newspaper in the bottom. Light the news paper , make sure 
they are burning set on the grate. In 1/2 an hour dump the white hot coals in 
the grill and tart cooking. The chimneys last for years, you don't need 
anything but paper to start them, and no petro chem taste. Cost of the chimney 
is appox 12 bucks. <br>

 Now papabob know what he is talking about. Use a charcoal chimney and 
no lighter fluid, and thus, no lighter fluid taste. We have both a Weber 
Charcoal grill and a commercial grade gas grill and a charcoal and an electric 
smoker, and i use them all. It just depends on what I am cooking and how much 
time I have. The charcoal grill is hands down my favorite of the two grills, 
however if I am in a hurry, its hard to beat the gas. So which is best? You 
really need both in my opinion. <br>

 Good article except where you say &quot;great grilling can 
be had over either charcoal or gas&quot;. I have both and use both. In summer 
we cook virtually everything outside to avoid heating the house. I use the gas 
as an oven and range. When I want grilling flavor, it's charcoal. They are not 
even in the same league. <br>

 I'm ready for the &quot;Face Off&quot;...If you 
want the smoky flavor of wood with the convenience of gas there is a heavy iron 
box that holds chips that can be placed over the gas flame.It is only about the 
size of your hand and has a sliding lid with holes to let the smoke escape.A 
small handfull of chips(you don't even have to soak them)and your in business. 
I found mine at Walmart for under 5 bucks. <br>

 I have found a few tricks to start charcoal, 
and one to improve the quality of gas grill cooking, 1st the Gas upgrade, which 
is realized by adding an additional bag of lava rock's to the burner area, if 
your cooking off the heat of the rocks, your also getting the smokey flavor's 
when the juices hit the rocks and the smoke rises around the Meat. The easy 
light charcoal idea came from recycling the papertowel and paperbags I use for 
Bacon greese absorbsion, these bacon soaked paper products burn extra long when 
twited tight and layed under easylight charcoal, one can also fix a two 
briquette by what ever length of easylight charcoal::::::::::: and then place 
the regular charcoal over the top of the eastlight, maybe 3-5 reg-charcoal's by 
whatever length you anticipait you need, and the twisted bacon soaked paper 
goes underneth the charcoals. It works great, hope others find this useable and 
perhaps stirring up some ideas of their own. BrotherThomas <br>

 I am from the southwest and 
&quot;grilling&quot; has been a tradition for as long as I can remember.. Our 
grills were 55G drums sawed in half and converted. Meat is always on the large 
side and the coals were always from Mesquite trees we harvested from the 
desert. Light the fire a couple hours early and wait for the burn down.. Is 
there a substitute? not in my opinion but I am now using &quot;gas&quot;.. Gas 
is simply easier, faster and with a little ingenuity, almost as good. I use 
mesquite or other hardwood wrapped in aluminum foil and placed on the burners 
with a few holes popped in the foil. They smoke nicely without flaming.. Sort 
of a PITA but well worth the trouble for imparting &quot;smoke&quot; flavor to 
the meats. I have done briskets , chicken and prime ribs like this and as long 
as you keep the foil packs working, they will in fact almost replace the flavor 
imparted by good lump charcoal. And in case there are any doubts, there is a 
big difference between brickettes and lump charcoal. As our fires were always 
from cured woods, they would more resemble &quot;lump&quot; charcoal which is 
simply wood reduced to the black carbon state you see in burned out campfires. 
Really quite superior to charcoal bricketts to me.. Lighting charcoal without 
fluid is easy with a chimney.. a piece of newspaper with a bit of cooking oil 
works wonders.. <br>

 Buy natural charcoal and use newspaper in a chimney starter. not starter fluid 
smell or taste. Using gas is not BBQ as the origian BBQ was done over an open 
fire using the locl wood which imparted the regionl flavors. You can char 
(burn) your food on gas or you can char (smoke) your food on charcoal. I live 
in AZ and we trimmed a mesquite tree which I kept the heavier limbs and dried 
them out to bank up a natural charcoal fire and got a wonderful mesquite smoke 
that people are still talkimg about. <br>

 Got to agree with Chef 
Ed. for the most part, however, I have two Cookshack smokers, (superb); one 
Platinum Weber Summit gas Grill, and also run a Charcoal Smoker when I have the 
chance, in addition to two portable grills. What can I say except, Que what you 
enjoy and use your grill as often as posible, and don't forget to have a cold 
one at the same time ! Oh, and don't forget to use your Crab and Lobster 
Steamer on occasion. <br>

 I have both gas and charcoal.I 
only use the gas if we get home late from baseball games and need to cook 
somthing quick. When we have people over or not going to games and have plenty 
of time to grill, charcoal is the way to go. I love playing with different 
flavor wood chips and indirect cooking.You need quick cooking go gas. You want 
great flavor go CHARCOAL !!!!! <br>

 I barbeque all year long and I have gas and charcoal and I 
love both. On summer time because the extra day time and weather I prefer 
charcoal for the smoky flavor plus most of the time there friends and family 
around. On the other hand on winter time you do the cooking along and here in 
Arkansas sometime is real cold and that when the gas grill is the champ. 
Friends and family still enjoy the food but they stay inside. <br>

 I hope I picked up a few 
good tricks reading all the comments because neither my husband nor I are very 
good at cooking on a fire. I particularly LOVE the flavor of cooking on a wood 
fire in our charcoal grill. There is one thing we cook on a wood fire that we 
always get complements on - Ribs. I cut the ribs in two-bone sections and then 
sear them in the flame of the wood fire. Then I coat them with BBQ sauce and 
cook them on high in the crock pot with nothing else until they are ready to 
almost fall off the bone. The flavor of the seared outside goes right through 
the meat. You do have to be careful, though, that you take them out before the 
meat actually falls off the bone. I do this in quantities, wrap each piece in 
plastic wrap and freeze them in a freezer bag. Great quick meal when you're 
busy or for unexpected company. <br>

 I have just finished reading everyones comments. I 
personaly use a gas grill and a wood only grill. I gutted an old gas grill and 
burn wood in it. The wood grill will light just as quickly as using charcoal. 
The wood flavor is by far my choice and my friends as well. But I do use my gas 
grill for quick and easy grilling. Yes, the gas grill does give a better flavor 
than cooking in the kitchen. <br>

 If you have access to hickory trees, gather a couple gallons 
of the fallen hickory nuts. Remove any outer covering on them. Place a few of 
them in your fire for a great smoky taste.They will keep almost forever in a 
net type bag in a dry place. <br>

 My late husband had the answer to nasty un healthy 
lighter fluid that he was adamantly against. He used wood to get the coals 
going &amp; paper &amp; wood slivers to get the wood going. Tasted the 
difference...Fabulous! <br>
