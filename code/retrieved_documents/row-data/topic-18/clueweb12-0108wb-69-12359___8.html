<p> <strong>Full Description</strong>:  The Horizon Smokers 16 Inch Classic 
Smoker Grill is the choice for thousands of backyard Barbecue enthusiasts 
because of its versatility and price. The Classic has also been recommended by 
Cooking Magazines and Television Personalities because of its Classic Look and 
Great Design. With its offset firebox and large cooking chamber it can easily 
cook for a small family or feed up to 40 people. The double damper system makes 
it easy to regulate your temperature. From a low 160 degrees for slow smoking 
to 250 degrees for barbecuing, all the way up to 325 for grilling, this smoker 
can do it all. The firebox dimensions are 16 diameter x 16 long and the cooking 
chamber dimensions are 16 diameter x 32 long. There is over 660 total square 
inches of cooking surface. The wheels are 12 inch diameter and the front shelf 
is 9 x 30. The 16 Inch Classic comes with two 15 x 15 chrome grates, a chrome 
firebox cooking grate, a firebox charcoal grate, and a clean out tool for to 
clean out ash from the cooking chamber and firebox. There is a 10 year warranty 
on the welding structure, and a lifetime on the burnout of the firebox. </p>
