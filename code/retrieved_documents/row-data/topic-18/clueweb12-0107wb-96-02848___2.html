 Grill 
cover is easy to put on.<br>
 Maybe it is because it is made specifically for 
this grill, but it goes on so easily, and fits so perfectly, I don't hesitate 
to put it on. A cover laying on the ground would be useless.not this one.  Pros:
Durable, Easy To Use, Improves Grill Function, Perfect Fit, Easy to put on <br>

 Best Uses: Patio, Barbeque <br>
 Describe Yourself: Occasional griller <br>

<br>  Great Gift idea! <br>
 This personalized grill cover makes a great gift 
for that &quot;hard to find a gift for person&quot;. The personalization option 
adds a creative component to an otherwise boring gift. Hey, everyone needs a 
grill cover, but you do not want to get one as a gift, right? But, when you can 
make it creative, it makes the perfect/unique gift item that will be on display 
and talked about at every barbeque!  Pros: Durable, Easy To Clean, Easy To Use, 
Perfect Fit <br>
 Best Uses: Patio, Barbeque <br>

 Get Cookin' with a Weber <br>
 This full length Weber grill 
cover fits nice and securely over the grill. Compared to other Weber grill 
covers I have had in the past, I was surprised that this one isn't as heavy 
&amp; thick as described, but it protects the grill like it is supposed to and 
I hope it will last for a long time. I know others have complained about the 
location of the vents being on the sides of the cover instead of the front and 
back as other Weber covers are designed, but a cover needs to allow air to 
circulate. Don't know if the location of the vents will be a problem just yet. 
Most important issue is keeping your grill covered &amp; protected if it is in 
an open area &amp; a good quality cover is worth it.  Pros: Easy To Use, 
Perfect Fit, Good design <br>
 Cons: Weight of material, PRICEY <br>
 Best Uses:
Patio, Barbeque <br>
