<h2>Why Thanksgiving is the most important American holiday</h2> 
<p>There are a lot of reasons to love Thanksgiving, chief among them the food, 
family, and fellowship. But think about this: We are a nation of immigrants. 
All of us is a descendant of an immigrant, even &quot;native&quot; Americans 
came here from somewhere else. Every nationality on earth, every culture, every 
language is here. Politics and religion divide us deeply and profoundly. But 
once a year we get together with our friends and families, fractious though 
they may be, give thanks to our various gods and hosts, and share a feast.</p> 
<p>A few of us may have lasagna or prime rib, but most of us, across the 
vastness of the nation, across all age groups, across politics and religion, 
share a menu of turkey with dressing made from bread, the humblest and noblest 
of foods; potatoes, the most earthy peasant food; cranberries, a bauble sweet 
and sour like life itself; something green because it is good for us; and 
All-American apple pie.</p> 
<p>OK, at your house you might skip the cranberries or prefer pumpkin pie, but 
the thought that so many of us are sharing this feast, this similar menu, this 
celebration, this unique national cultural touchstone, is enough to make me 
weep, all the more because food, my great love, is at the center of the action, 
even more so when I realize that thousands of you are eating my recipes.</p> 
<p>Americans share this event not only nationwide, but overseas, from war 
zones to expats on the job in Johannesburg or Johannisberg.</p> 
<p>Americans share this event with our ancestors back in time to 1621, less 
than a year after the Mayflower dropped British colonists in Plymouth, MA. They 
left England to seek religious freedom, and they gave thanks for their first 
harvest by sharing a feast with the Wampanoag tribe. The celebration continued 
informally until 1863 when President Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving 
Day to be held each November.</p> 
<p>That means the feast we are sharing with friends and family has been shared 
like this for almost 400 years, far longer a national celebration than 
Independence Day.</p> 
<p>To me Thanksgiving is every bit as meaningful and profound as the Fourth of 
July. Yes, the flag is a potent symbol, and I swell with pride as much as the 
next guy at its sight, but the flag is everywhere from bumperstickers to 
bandanas. When I sit down for dinner on the fourth Thursday in November and 
reflect on the fact that I am part of a ritual feast shared by so many for so 
long, I am deeply and truly awed.</p> 
<p>The Thanksgiving ceremonial repast makes us all part of an unparalleled 
time-space continuum. It is truly the most important American holiday. I look 
forward to dining with you every year.</p> <br>

<h2>My #1 top tip: Use digital thermometers</h2> 
<p>Turkey is unforgiving and your guests are unforgetting. Undercook, and 
turkey is slimy and after dinner everyone is praying to the porcelain god. 
Overcook, and you have attic insulation. The most important thing to do when 
cooking turkey is to hit the target temps on the money. Good news: It's easy 
with the right tools.</p> 
<p>Take a look at the calendar. This is the digital age. Bi-metal dial 
thermometers were invented in the 1800s, and all but the most expensive models 
can most charitably be called indicators, not precision measuring instruments.
</p> 
<p>Cooking without a good digital thermometer is like driving without a 
speedometer, flying without an altimeter, building furniture without a tape 
measure, filling your tires without a pressure gauge, or repairing the reactor 
without a Geiger counter. Digital thermometers are inexpensive, fast, and 
accurate. They will pay for themselves in one steak dinner or one trip to the 
doctor.</p> 
<p>You simply cannot trust the cheap bimetal dial thermometer that the 
manufacturer installed in your cooker, shown on the right. Grill manufacturers 
compete to undercut each other's prices so they are not about to install a high 
end thermometer, especially when most of their grills are used for hot dogs and 
burgers. They buy bargain basement. Even the top brands use cheapo 
thermometers. Look at the picture above. That dial thermometer is off by 
50&deg;F. This is common. And Hasty Bake is one of my favorite grill makers. 
They don't make junk grills.</p> 
<p>Grill thermometers are not only inaccurate, but they are mounted in the 
lid, waaaay above the cooking surface. Well, the temp in the dome can be a lot 
different than the temp at the grate. The grate is much closer to the heat 
source and the dome is closer to the ambient air. If you are cooking on 
Thanksgiving Day north of the Mason-Dixon Line, that air temp is<em>cold.</em>
</p> 
<p>Neither can you trust the popup thermometer that comes inserted in the bird.
 The plunger that pops up is anchored in metal that melts at 185&deg;F. At that 
temp a turkey breast is more particle board than party. We do not want our meat 
to go above 165&deg;F so that 20&deg;F difference is the difference between 
succulent and sucky. Worse still, if you stuff your bird, it is not measuring 
the temp of the stuffing which is several inches further away from the heat 
than the tip of the popup.</p> 
<p>Neither can you trust the bi-metal &quot;instant read&quot; dial 
thermometer in your kitchen drawer. In most cases &quot;instant read&quot; 
means 30 seconds to get at best a ballpark reading. You need to be able to poke 
a breast and read it<em>right now</em>. You need to be able to pull it back 
gently and see how the temps vary throughout the meat. Then you need to move on 
and test the thigh. And then close the lid before all the heat escapes. If you 
have a bi-metal dial thermometer in the kitchen drawer, right now, go and throw 
it out.</p> 
<p>I use two thermometers when I cook indoors or outdoors: One, the Maverick 
ET-732, has two probes. One that can be inserted into the breast and left there 
throughout the cook. The other has a clip so it can hover just above the 
cooking grate. Both are attached to cables that run from the probes to the 
outside of the grill so I can monitor the temperature of both the meat and the 
oven at any time without opening the lid. It even has a wireless monitor that I 
can sit on the coffee table while I watch the game, and alarms in case I 
snooze. There is another good one, theiGrill (above), that communicates with my 
iPhone and iPad via Bluetooth.</p> 
<p>And just for good measure I use one more digital when I'm doing turkey, the 
super fastThermapen, that I can use to spot check the meat in multiple 
locations.</p> 
<p>Good therms will save you a lot of money and grief in the long run, and 
nothing will improve your cooking more, outdoor or in. Please click here for a 
in depthbuying guide to thermometers.</p> <br>

<h2>Make muffings!</h2> 
<p>Now here's an outside the bird concept: Try cooking stuffing in well 
buttered muffin pans so each individual &quot;muffing&quot; will brown all 
around making lots more crunchy bits! If you want your stuffing wet and juicy, 
there will be lots of gravy from this recipe to pour over it.</p> 
<p>If you absolutely positively must have the stuffing in the cavity, then 
make it very moist, heat it in up to 165&deg;F and stuff the bird with steaming 
hot stuffing. Then the meat won't overcook while waiting for the stuffing to 
heat up.</p> 
<p>If you must stuff the bird, then cook it at a lower temp, like 225&deg;F so 
the exterior will not dry out as much. But you still must get everything up to 
160 to 165&deg;F before you take it off the heat because juices from the bird 
will get into the stuffing. For my favorite stuffing and muffing recipe, see 
chapter X.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between white meat and dark meat?</h2> 
<p>As much as we are fascinated with breasts in this easily titillated 
society, I should set the record straight: Technically a turkey has one large 
breast divided by a breast bone. So as to not confuse, I shall be technically 
incorrect in this article and refer to each pectoral muscle as a separate 
breast.</p> 
<p>Turkey breasts are called white meat because the muscles are paler than the 
meat of the legs and thighs. That's because domesticated turkeys can't fly, so 
their legs and thighs get more exercise than the breasts and wings. As a 
result, the muscles of the legs and thighs must be more efficient at using 
oxygen for continuous muscle contractions over an extended time. These 
&quot;slow-twitch&quot; muscles fire slowly and fatigue slowly, so they need 
more oxygen for fuel. To supply this oxygen they have more myoglobin and fat in 
them. Myoglobin is a pink protein liquid that stores oxygen brought to it by 
the blood, and fat is a storehouse of fuel. The pink liquid in the plastic bag 
the bird comes in is myoglobin. Dark meat is pink when cooked medium rare just 
like pork, but for safety reasons we cook it well past pink until it turns gray.
</p> 
<p>Breast meat is made of &quot;fast-twitch&quot; pectoral muscles that are 
good at short bursts of rapid contraction, but they fatigue quickly. They don't 
need much oxygen so they have much less of the pink myoglobin leaving the meat 
white when cooked.</p> 
<p>Since domesticated birds are largely confined and get little exercise, none 
of their muscles have nearly as much myoglobin for storing oxygen as red meat 
animals such as beef.</p> <br>

<h2>You don't need a fancy smoker to make a fancy smoked turkey</h2> 
<p>A smoker is nice for this recipe, but the Ultimate Turkey can be done just 
as easily on a normal charcoal or gas grill. In fact, it can be done indoors 
without the smoke and still turn out a killer meal. For the internet's best 
buying guide to grills and smokers,click here. With a grill, it is best to use a
2-zone setup (click that link to see exactly what I mean and when you are on 
that page click the links that show you how to set up a charcoal grill, gas 
grill, offset smoker, or bullet smoker).</p> 
<p>You can make the Ultimate Turkey on just about any grill. In fact, you can 
even follow these concepts and techniques and make it indoors, too. You'll just 
have to omit the wood. Don't even think about using wood indoors. You'll never 
get the smell out of the place and you'll be sleeping on the couch for weeks.

<p>Below is a butterflied (spatchcocked) bird on a 30 year old $89 Weber 
Kettle charcoal grill outfitted with aSmokenator, a device that holds the coals 
off to one side. Notice that the dark meat is closer to the coals since we want 
it cooked to a higher temp and the drip pan about 3&quot; below. Instant read 
digital thermometer is reading 159.2&deg;F. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

<p>Below is my 15 year old Weber Genesis gas grill. I have removed the cooking 
grates. The bird sits on a wire rack above the drip pan filled with a flavorful 
gravy, and the drip pan sits right on the flame deflector bars. On the left is 
a disposable aluminum loaf pan with apple wood chips sitting on the hottest 
burner. I have covered the tips of the wings and drums with foil to keep them 
from burning. The foil is removed later and about 30 minutes before the bird is 
done, I removed the drip pan to firm up the back of the bird. Click here tosee

<h2>Injecting and brining</h2> 
<p>For years I have advocated wet brining turkey, but I have changed my tune 
and I now prefer injecting. Yes, I am a flip-flopper, so don't vote for me if I 
run for President.</p> 
<h2>Wet brining</h2> 
<p>Wet brining is the process of submerging the bird in a couple of gallons of 
a 5 to 10% saline solution, often with herbs and spices added.</p> 
<p>The problem with wet brining is that it can take a long time to get the 
salt water deep into the meat. It is also wasteful. You mix up a couple of 
gallons of salt and spices, and the bird only sucks in about a cup.</p> 
<p>Research for AmazingRibs.com by Dr. Greg Blonder is fascinating. He decided 
to see how salt penetration is impacted by time. He took a 12&quot; long tube 
of lean pork loin and soaked it in a 6% brine for 24 hours in the fridge. 
Periodically he lopped off a cross section and treated it with an indicator 
that showed colored salty meat. Here's how far the salt penetrated:</p> 
<p><strong>30 minutes:</strong> 0.16&quot; (3-4 mm)<strong><br>
 1 hour:
</strong> 0.24&quot; (5-6 mm)<strong><br>
 2 hours:</strong> 0.28&quot; (7 mm)
<strong><br>
 4 hours:</strong> 0.39&quot; (10 mm)<strong><br>
 8 hours:
</strong> 0.51&quot; (13 mm)<strong><br>
 24 hours:</strong> 0.67&quot; (17 mm)
</p> 
<p>That's right, after 2 hours the salt had penetrated only 1/4&quot;, and 
after 24 hours the salt had traveled only 2/3&quot; deep in the meat. Actual 
penetration can vary on different meats and turkey is slightly more porous than 
pork, but you get the picture: When you brine, the salt remains pretty close to 
the surface.</p> 
<p>But when you start cooking the meat, the brine starts moving deep down. By 
using a salt sensitive dye, Blonder was able to show what happens. The orange 
parts are meat that has no salt. As you can see from the top photo, the salt 
has not gotten very deep into the meat after 12 hours soaking in a wet brine, 
but after cooking it has infiltrated fairly deep, seasoning the meat pretty 
thoroughly.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, the salt even penetrates skin and bone. Tht's because turkey 
skin is only about 40% fat, so the brine can move through the wet channels. It 
can move through bone because bird bones are very light and pourous, unlike 
beef bones.</p> 
<p>For more on the subject read my article on The Zen of Brining.</p> 
<h2>Brine recipe</h2> 
<p>Remember, don't wet brine a bird that has been pre-salted at the factory. I 
know from first hand experience, and my wife won't let me forget it. Birds that 
have been pre-salted are labeled &quot;basted&quot;, &quot;self-basted&quot;, 
&quot;enhanced&quot;, or &quot;kosher&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong>For the brine</strong><br>
 1 cup [56 ml] hot water in a 2 cup 
measuring cup<br>
 1 pound [454 gm] salt (any salt will do)<br>
 1 cup [56 ml] 
white sugar<br>
 8 tablespoons of garlic powder (not garlic salt)<br>
 6 
tablespoons ground black pepper<br>
 2 gallons [7.6 L] cold water</p> 
<p><em><strong>About the salt.</strong> The method we use to mix the brine 
doesn't care what type of salt you use becuse we are going by weight not 
volume. The volume will vary significantly depending on whether you use table 
salt, kosher salt, pickling salt, or sea salt, but the weight remains the same. 
Sounds weird, but you'll see how it works.</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>About the sugar.</strong> If you are diabetic, you can skip the 
sugar, although truth be told, very little actually gets into the meat.</em></p>
<p>You may see brine recipes elsewhere that call for adding chicken stock, 
vegetable stock, apple juice, and all kinds of herbs and spices. Don't waste 
your money. They barely impact the flavor. You'll have plenty of flavor without 
them, especially from the gravy.</p> 
<p>1) Add one cup of hot water to a two cup measuring cup. Then pour in salt, 
<em>any salt</em>, until the water line reaches 2 cups. It doesn't matter if 
you have table salt, kosher salt, or sea salt. The volume may differ when it is 
dry, but the weight is the same, and the displacement of the water is the same. 
It's called Archimedes' principle.</p> 
<p>Pour the slurry into a very clean container large enough to hold the meat 
and 2 gallons of water. The best tool is a plastic insulated cooler. If the 
cooler is large, you may need to scale up the brine recipe to make sure the 
bird is submerged. You can use something like a large stainless steel pot, but 
the ice will melt quickly if it doesn't fit in the fridge and you'll need to 
add more ice. Do not use an aluminum pot. It can react with the salt and create 
off flavors. If you only have an aluminum pot, line it with a food safe plastic 
bag such as the Ziploc XL. But the best tool by far is an insulated plastic 
cooler. You can use it later when the bird is done to keep it warm. Just clean 
it thoroughly with hot soapy water.</p> 
<p>Then add the sugar, garlic, and black pepper. Stir until most of the sugar 
is dissolved. The garlic and pepper will not dissolve. Then add the cold water.
</p> 
<p>2) Submerge the meat in the brine breast side (the large humped side) down 
and refrigerate. If you can't fit it in the fridge toss in a gallon zipper bag 
filled with ice. Or two. The bags should be tight so that when the ice melts it 
doesn't dilute the brine. If you use a bag of ice from the store, make sure it 
is tight so the ice won't melt and dilute the brine. Clean storebought bags of 
ice thoroughly with soap and water and rinse them completely. People often walk 
on them in the delivery truck. Another option is to fill a quart juice or soda 
bottle with water and freeze it. Then screw on the cap. Wait til after the 
bottle has frozen because water expands when it freezes and it can blow off the 
cap. Wash off the outside of the bottle thoroughly and toss it in the brine.</p>
<p>Move the bird around and get the air bubble out of the cavity. You may need 
to weight the meat down to submerge it. If you cannot submerge it, make sure 
you turn it periodically and extend it's time in the bath. Let the bird swim in 
the brine for up to 12 hours in a refrigerator or other cool place. Keep the 
brine under 40&deg;F, adding more ice when necessary. If you can see unmelted 
ice, it is probably below 40&deg;F.</p> 
<p>3) After no more than 12 hours, remove the bird, rinse it <em>thoroughly
</em> inside and out so the exterior will not be too salty, and pat dry. Be 
sure not to leave it in the brine longer than 12 hours. Rinsing is crucial!</p> 
<p>4) While the skin is soft and elastic, insert your fingers carefully 
between the skin and the meat and loosen it all around so later you can put the 
wet rub in there. You can work from both the front and rear, and reach down to 
the thighs and wings.</p> 
<p>5) If time permits, place the bird on a rack in the refrigerator for 3 
hours or more so the skin will dry. You can even leave it there overnight. This 
will help make the skin crispy. Make sure you put a pan under the bird to catch 
drips.</p> 
<h2>Basic poultry injection</h2> 
<p>Injecting is a sure fire way to get the flavor and juiciness down deep. It 
is the only way to get fats, herbs, spices and other large molecules deep into 
meat. By injecting, you don't have to worry about oversalting, you can do it at 
the last minute, you have less waste, less cost, no huge containers are needed, 
no refrigeration space problems, and the biggest safety issue is making sure 
you don't stab yourself.</p> 
<p>To inject, you should use a special hypodermic for food. For more on the 
subject, read my article onThe Zen of Injecting.</p> 
<p><strong>Makes.</strong> 2 cups, more than enough to inject a large turkey
</p> 
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
 2 teaspoons salt<br>
 2 teaspoons sugar
<br> 2 cups [112 ml] water or low sodium chicken stock, or a mix of both</p> 
<p><em><strong>About the salt.</strong> If you use kosher salt, double the 
quantity.</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Here's an idea.</strong> Smoke the salt.</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Optional.</strong> You can add 1/2 teaspoon of MSG such as 
Ac'cent. MSG, also known as glutamic acid, is a flavor enhancer as well as a
<strong>natural</strong> byproduct of some aging and fermentation processes. 
Some people believe that MSG can cause headaches, but scientists have not been 
able to prove the connection.According to the Mayo Clinic &quot;researchers 
have found no definitive evidence of a link between MSG and these 
symptoms.&quot; The eminent food writer Jeffrey Steingarten attempted to debunk 
what he considers to be an urban legend in his famous essay&quot;Why Doesn't 
Everyone in China Have a Headache?&quot;</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Optional.</strong> You can add herbs and spices such as garlic 
and pepper, but they can overwhelm the meat's natural flavor. Go easy.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Do this</strong><br>
 1) Mix all the ingredients in a bottle and 
shake vigorously before injecting. Pour into a narrow container so you can suck 
fluid in through the needle. In a wide bowl it is hard to get the holes below 
the water line and you then need to unscrew the top, pour it into the syringe, 
spill it everywhere, screw on the top, inject, and repeat. I bought a V-shaped 
flower vase for the job.</p> 
<p>2) Insert the needle parallel to the grain and go all the way to the 
center. Press the plunger slowly and ease the needle out. Insert the needle 
about every 1.5&quot; apart and leave behind about 1 ounce per pound. A little 
liquid will follow the needle out of the hole, but if it comes spurting out, 
use less pressure. We want to avoid pockets of liquid.</p> 
<p>3) You can cook right away, but if you let the meat rest for an hour or 
more, even overnight, the injection will disperse more evenly through the meat.
</p> 
<h2>Butterballing the meat</h2> 
<p>If your bird has had a salt solution injected at the factory, you can still 
amp it up and add richness, moisture, and flavor by injecting melted butter.</p>
<p>Melt 1 stick of butter (4 ounces) over a low heat. Use the same tools and 
methods above to inject the butter deep into the meat, focusing on the breasts.
</p> <br>

<h2>Too tall a tom? In a hurry? Butterfly that bird.</h2> 
<p>If the lid on your your grill is too low then butterfly (spatchcock) the 
bird. If you are in a hurry the bird cooks more quickly when cut up.</p> 
<p>The cavity will brown better, the bird will cook faster, and it is easy to 
get your hands under the skin where the backbone came out. Butterflies are also 
easier to carve when done.</p> 
<p>You'll need good pair of poultry shears. A knife will work, but shears will 
work better.<strong> </strong>Get sturdy stainless blades so you can cut 
through the ribs. The best models come apart at the hinge so they can go in the 
dishwasher. TryOXO Good Grips Professional Poultry Shears, above. In a pinch, 
tin snips from your tool kit in the garage will do the job.</p> 
<p>1) To butterfly a bird, remove the backbone by cutting along both sides of 
it. You don't have to be precise. Rinse off any dark brown organ parts and 
discard them, and throw the backbone in the drip pan.</p> 
<p>2) Cut off the wing tips and toss them in the drip pan, too.</p> 
<p>3) From the front cavity, either remove the wishbone for the kids or cut 
through it with your shears.</p> 
<p>4) Now you can open the bird up and squish it flat. You may need to take a 
knife and make shallow slits on either side of the breast bone in order to 
flatten it, but it doesn't have to be perfectly flat.</p> <br>

<h2>Total control: Cut the bird in 6 parts</h2> 
<p>If you don't feel obligated by tradition to serve a whole bird, then 
consider cutting it into parts. You can then get the light meat and dark meat 
cooked perfectly because they are independent of each other. Try this:</p> 
<p>Remove the backbone and toss it in the gravy. Then remove the wings. Cut 
the tips off the wings and throw them in the gravy. Cut off the thighs at the 
ball joint where it meats the body, leave the drums attached. Now remove the 
breasts by running your knife along the sides of the breast bone and follow the 
rones with your kinife along the rib cage until you have two big breasts.</p> 
<p>Start the thighs and breasts first and keep the rest aside for about 20 
minutes. Then add the drums and wings. Watch their temps individually with an 
instant read thermometer. Remove the breasts and the thick part of the wings at 
160 to 165&deg;F and the dark meat at 170&deg;F. If you want, you can even go 
crazy and paint the drums with barbecue sauce. Everything will be tender, 
juicy, and finished in about 2 hours because parts cook more quickly than a 
whole bird.</p> <br>

<h2><strong>Cooking turkey breasts only</strong></h2> 
<p>If you don't want to do a whole bird, you can get turkey breasts. They come 
in three forms, a double breast cut off the bird with bone in, a single 
boneless breast (above), or two breasts de-boned and rolled together and held 
tight with a mesh. The mesh is a pain to get off after you are done cooking. I 
much prefer the bone in breasts or boneless breasts. A 3 to 6 pound breast will 
be done in 1.5 to 2 hours at 325&deg;F, and larger breasts will be done in 2 to 
2.5 hours. Boneless double breasts tied as roasts take about 2 to 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>Just follow the same basic concept as for the whole bird. Inject or brine, 
watch the temp like a hawk circling a flock of turkeys. You will need to add 
chicken stock to the gravy because there will be few drippings and no neck and 
skin to throw in there. Another option is to paint them with a Teriyaki or 
Yakitori sauce.</p> 
<p>But if you're going to the trouble, why not cook the whole bird and savor 
the leftovers in sandwiches, salads, pot pies... ?</p> <br>

<h2><strong>Is pink meat safe?</strong></h2> 
<p>Yes, it can be, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), if it 
has been cooked to a temperature of 165&deg;F in the center of the breast.</p> 
<p>First of all, some turkey meat is naturally pink. According to the USDA 
&quot;The color of cooked meat and poultry is not always a sure sign of its 
degree of doneness. Only by using a food thermometer can one accurately 
determine that a meat has reached a safe temperature. Turkey, fresh pork, 
ground beef, or veal can remain pink even after cooking to temperatures of 
160&deg;F and higher. The meat of smoked turkey is always pink.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition, smoked meat turns pink due to a chemical reaction with the 
combustion gases and the smoke and the meat. For the Ultimate Turkey, we take 
the bird off at 160&deg;F and it will rise to 165&deg;F even if it is off the 
cooker.</p> 
<p>Click here for more on what are ideal meat temps. Click here for more on 
meat science and the thermodynamics of cooking.</p> 
<h2>What about red or pink juices?</h2> 
<p>Because of the speed with which commercial turkey farms grow their birds, 
it is not uncommon for there to be red or pink juices in the thigh joints even 
if the meat is properly cooked to 165&deg;F. That's because the joints bones 
have not had a chance to properly harden. If a little red makes you nervous, 
even if your thermometer is at 165&deg;F, after carving, a minute or two in the 
microwave will take care of it.</p> <br>

<h2>Rotisseries</h2> 
<p>Rotisseries are a good way to cook meat because the process of rotating it 
between hot and cool zones retains juices and insures even cooking,but I don't 
recommend them for turkey.</p> 
<p>The problem is that you need to truss the bird up tight on a spit or else 
the wings and drums go flopping around and get burned. If you truss your bird, 
the skin beneath the wings, thighs, and drums never darkens and stays rubbery. 
And because the thigh is pressed tightly against the side, it takes too long to 
warm and cook through, so by the time it hits ideal temp, about 170&deg;F, the 
breast is overcooked. That's why I recommend cooking turkey untrussed.</p> 
<p>In addition, it is difficult to balance the bird on the spit. If it is 
imbalanced it puts serious strain on the motor. I've heard of them burning out. 
Replacement motors are usually north of $100. Some rotisseries come with 
counterweights that you put on the handle to balance the whole gizmo, like the 
weights you put on tires to balance them. That is a good thing.</p> 
<p>Finally, the bird can rip loose of its moorings, and then you have torn 
breasts. I say fogeddaboudit.</p> <br>

<h2>Vertical roasters</h2> 
<p>If your cooker is tall enough, and most eggs, kamados, and ceramic grills 
are, you may wish to roast the bird vertically. The device you want is a wire 
armature that supports the bird like theSpanek Vertical Roaster (at right).</p> 
<p>The advantage of a vertical roaster is that you get much better airflow up 
into the cavity than when the bird is reclining and that means better smoke 
penetration from the inside as well as more even and faster cooking. The 
disadvantage is that you can't easily put aromatics in the cavity which you can 
do when the bird is horizontal. Just make sure the tail sits about 3&quot; 
above the drip pan for proper airflow.</p> 
<p>You don't want a beer can type arrangement or anything with solid sides 
because the metal blocks airflow to the cavity and impedes smoke and heat. And 
no, the liquid in the can will not add moisture to the meat, especially where 
the can is in contact with meat.</p> <br>

<h2>Breasts up!</h2> 
<p>Some people like to cook breast side down because they think fat and juices 
will percolate down and keep the breast moist.</p> 
<p>But juices simply can't travel through that much flesh. Juices are mostly 
trapped within cells and go nowhere. And if they could, the pressure of hot 
liquids would push them up, away from the heat, like the liquid in a glass 
thermometer.</p> 
<p>And where would these juices come from? Visualize an upside down turkey. 
The breast is maybe 3&quot; thick at most. What is above it? The cavity. No 
juices there. Even if the cavity was filled with liquid, there are no pipelines 
for juices to travel through. In fact, the breasts sit on the rib cage and 
beneath that is the<em>pleura</em>, a membrane.</p> 
<p>If you want the fat to baste the breasts, well breasts have little fat. 
It's in the skin, which would be below the breasts if they were upside down, so 
melting fat would just drip out, not bathe the meat.</p> 
<p>Finally, if you cook breast down, you smush the breasts and put marks on 
the skin. Ugly.</p> <br>

<h2><strong>Give your bird a lift</strong></h2> 
<p>You'll need something to lift the hot turkey out of the cooker. You can buy 
specialized turkey lifters, but they are mono-taskers. I use my bear paws 
(shown here).</p> 
<p>They were designed for pulling pork, but they can do double duty as lifters.
Click here for more info about these handy tools.</p> 
<p>If you don't want another gadget in the kitchen, you can lift a turkey with 
two wooden spoons. Just stick the handle of each into the front and rear cavity.
</p> <br>

<h2></h2> 
<h2>Don't sweat the timing with a faux cambro</h2> 
<p>If you are unsure about what temp your cooker will settle in at, and 
variables like the ambient temperature, sun, and wind can really muck things 
up, I recommend you put the bird on 30 to 60 minutes early, and when the probe 
says it is 160 to 165&deg;F, put the bird into a faux Cambro to keep the bird 
warm until dinner time. A real Cambro is an insulated storage box popular with 
caterers. A faux cambro is a beer cooler.</p> 
<p>The meat temp will rise about 5&deg;F at first, and an hour later the temp 
will have dropped only about 5 to 10&deg;F! Just don't let it drop below 
150&deg;F. If you have a good cooler, it should stay safe for up to 3 hours. 
This technique will soften the skin a bit, but that's better than going cold 
turkey. So get that cooler cleaned up before you start cooking.</p> 
<p>The faux cambro is especially handy if you need to take the bird over the 
river and through the woods. Click here to read more about how to use afaux 
Cambro.</p> <br>

<h2>Granny's gravy</h2> 
<p>If you absolutely must make traditional thick gravy, here's how:</p> 
<p>1) Take about 4 tablespoons of the turkey fat and/or butter and put it in a 
saucepan over medium heat with 4 tablespoons of flour (the ratio is 1:1). Flour 
tastes better than cornstarch if you do this properly. Whisk the flour until 
the mixture is smooth, and keep whisking until it starts to turn pale amber, 
about 3 minutes. This is called a medium<em>roux</em>. The browning cooks the 
flour and kills the pasty flavor. You can make it richer by cooking it longer 
and letting it get darker, but don't let it turn brown.</p> 
<p>2) Slowly pour 1 cup [56 ml] of the smoked gravy into the roux, whisking it 
over medium heat as you pour, and keep whisking until it thickens and all lumps 
are gone.</p> 
<p>3) Taste it before you add anything. You will probably want to add another 
cup of the thin gravy. You should not need to add salt and pepper. This should 
make the traditionalists very happy because this smoky, enriched stock will 
make a better gravy than any they ever had.</p> <br>

<h2>Talking turkey trivia</h2> 
<p> A mature male is a tom, a female is a hen, an immature male is a jake, an 
immature female is a jenny. Some people believe hens are slightly more tender 
than toms, but because most turkeys are slaughtered when young, usually 4 to 5 
months old, there is no noticeable difference according to taste tests by<em>
Cook's Illustrated</em> magazine.</p> 
<p> Wild turkeys can fly short distances to escape hunters. They can run fast, 
too. Domestic turkeys are too heavy to fly.</p> 
<p> The old saw that turkeys are so stupid that they will look up in a 
rainstorm and drown is a myth. They can, however, be drowned in gravy.</p> 
<p> The flap of skin on top of the beak is a snood, the flap under the beak is 
the wattle.</p> 
<p> The gizzard can contain stones to help the turkey with digestion.</p> 
<p> Turkeys are native to North America. They were exported to Europe in the 
16th century.</p> 
<p> Stop blaming the tryptophan. The reason you fall asleep after dinner is 
not because of tryptophan in the turkey. It doesn't have much more of this 
essential amino acid than other meats. According to research, the ratio of 
tryptophan to food is about the same as a pork chop, chicken, salmon, beef, 
lamb chops. You fall asleep because you are exhausted from cooking, cleaning, 
inlaws, chasing kids, stuffing your face, and watching the poor pitiful Lions.
</p> 
<p> Turkeys are nervous, but like being stroked and cuddled. Just like 
Meathead.</p> <br>

<h2>Ben Franklin and the national bird.<br>
 Was he serious?</h2> 
<p>It is often said that Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) prefered the turkey to 
the eagle as our national bird, but it is not clear that he was serious. The 
notion comes froma letter he wrote to his daughter, Sarah Franklin Bache 
(1768-1807), on January 26, 1784. In the letter he is critical of the eagle's 
habits and the artwork depicting it, perhaps mocking the fact that it took six 
years for Congress to chose a national bird. It sounds to me as if Franklin, 
known for his wit, was exercising it well:</p> 
<p>&quot;For my own part I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen the 
Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral character. He does not 
get his Living honestly. You may have seen him perch'd on some dead Tree near 
the River, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the Labour of the 
Fishing Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish, and is 
bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones, the Bald 
Eagle pursues him and takes it from him.</p> 
<p>&quot;With all this Injustice, he is never in good Case but like those 
among Men who live by Sharping &amp; Robbing he is generally poor and often 
very lousy. Besides he is a rank Coward...</p> 
<p>&quot;I am, on this account, not displeas'd that the Figure is not known as 
a Bald Eagle, but looks more like a Turky. For in truth, the Turky is in 
comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of 
America... He is besides, though a little vain &amp; silly, a Bird of Courage, 
and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should 
presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on.&quot;</p> <br>

<h2>Wine for turkey: Match the sides, not the bird</h2> 
<p>Turkey, gravy, stuffing, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie. No 
other meal has such a set menu. So what to serve?</p> 
<p>When cooked properly, turkey can be tasty and moist. When overcooked, as it 
often is, the dry meat is neutral and unexciting. So we moisten it with gravy 
and cranberry sauce and surround it with sweet dishes to enliven it.</p> 
<p>If the task of selecting the beverage to accompany the annual eat-in has 
fallen to you, remember the sweetness of the sides, the fact that you are 
buying for everyone, not just yourself, and the fact that the average American 
does not like wine that is very dry.</p> 
<p>What is needed is something quenching to wash down overcooked white meat, 
something with a hint of sweetness so it will not taste bitter beside the sweet 
side dishes, something tart enough to cut their sweetness, and something 
friendly that everybody will love.</p> 
<p>Below are my recommendations for different <em>types</em> of wines. Ask 
your wine merchant for specific recommendations. They will rarely steer you 
wrong because they want you back.</p> 
<h2>With a hint of sweetness</h2> 
<p><strong>German Riesling Kabinett.</strong> German Riesling is light and 
fresh, and Kabinett is a grade of wine that is slightly sweet, but not too 
sweet. It can be floral and like a handful of fresh grapes.</p> 
<p><strong>Austrian Riesling, New York Riesling, </strong>and<strong> 
Washington State Riesling.</strong> Occasionally as good as the best German 
Rieslings, Austrian Rieslings are good values, and the best New Yorkers and 
Washingtonians, although not cheap, can be shockingly good.</p> 
<p><strong>Alsace Riesling.</strong> Similar to German Riesling, but often a 
bit more complex from aging in wood barrels.</p> 
<p><strong>Alsace Pinot Blanc.</strong> Refreshing, tart, complex, with just a 
hint of sweetness.</p> 
<p><strong>Alsace Pinot Gris </strong>and<strong> Oregon Pinot Gris.</strong> 
Light and tart. Steer away from California Pinot Gris. It is usually dull and 
boring.</p> 
<p><strong>French Rhone whites, American Viognier, American Rousanne, </strong>
and<strong> American Marsanne.</strong> These are bigger wines, richer, 
complex, but rarely too sharp or harsh. Often reminiscent of tropical fruits.
</p> 
<p><strong>Ros&eacute; </strong>and other<strong> pink wines.</strong> These 
wines are very refreshing and delightful. Alas, most are too sweet. But if you 
can find a good one that is off-dry, it will go well with your meal.</p> 
<h3>Drier wines</h3> 
<p>If your guests are into wine and prefers them bone dry, and if your meal is 
more savory than sweet:</p> 
<p><strong>Sauvignon Blanc </strong>and<strong> Semillon.</strong> I love 
these wines, especially Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and white wines from 
Bordeaux, but they are usually bone dry, and are not great matches to all the 
sweet stuff. If your meal is mostly savory, and your guests winos, go this 
route.</p> 
<p><strong>Pinot Noir </strong>and<strong> French Burgundy.</strong> The best 
of these are expensive, but they can be lighter than Cabernet and Merlot, and 
more tart, making them great foils for rich savory foods.</p>

<h1>The Ultimate Turkey:<br>
 Smoked On The Barbecue Or The Grill.<br>
 Or Not.
 Gobble 'til You Wobble!</h1> 
<p><strong>By Meathead</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Smoked turkey tastes spectacular, but there are 
tricks revealed in this recipe that make it the Ultimate Turkey, whether it is 
smoked outdoors or roasted in your kitchen. <strong>Recipe Type.</strong> Entree
.<strong>Tags.</strong> Turkey, smoked turkey, BBQ, barbecue, barbeque, grilling
,smoking, cookout, party, dinner, smoker, grill.</p> 
<p>This is no ordinary turkey preparation, pilgrims. Digest these logical 
concepts and you will never again have a dry, stringy, cardboardy, boring bird.
</p> 
<p>After tasting this bird you will never again risk life or limb, nor stain 
the driveway with grease by deep frying a turkey. This will be the best turkey 
you've ever tasted. I know because hundreds of readers have written to tell me 
so (see the comments and pictures at the bottom of the page).</p> 
<p>The good news is that you don't need a smoker, although having one helps. 
You can become a Turkey Zen Master on any old backyard grill, or even in your 
indoor oven with these techniques. But remember, when you cook the bird 
outdoors, you not only get great flavor, you free up the indoor oven for sweet 
potatoes, stuffing, green beans, and pie.</p> 
<p>Here's a great idea: Rather than waiting for Thanksgiving, when you have a 
houseful of critics, why not have a turkey shoot a few weeks in advance to get 
your technique down?</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Manifesto</h2> 
<p>Turkey poses several problems that we can solve by thinking scientifically. 
My methods differ drastically from tradition, but if you follow my guidelines 
you can make this flightless bird soar above the flock. Here is an overview 
from 30,000 feet. I will discuss each concept in detail, below.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>We will not stuff the bird. When you stuff the bird it takes far longer 
for the heat to travel to the center of the stuffing and in the process the 
exterior gets way too hot and the meat gets overcooked. By leaving the cavity 
empty the heat and smoke flavors can enter the cavity, cooking the bird much 
faster and more evenly without overcooking.</li> 
<li>We will place a few aromatics in the cavity. Not enough to prevent 
airflow, but they will create penetrating vapors that will flavor the meat more 
than the stuffing could.</li> 
<li>If your turkey is not labeled &quot;basted&quot;, &quot;self-basted&quot;, 
&quot;enhanced&quot;, or &quot;kosher&quot; we will add moisture and flavor 
with either an injection or by soaking in a brine.</li> 
<li>Even if it has been injected with a saline solution at the factory, and 
chances are that it was, we can still amp up boring birds by injecting them 
with butter.</li> 
<li>Because herbs and spices cannot get very far past the skin, we will use a 
wet rub of oil and aromatic herbs<em>under</em> the skin to baste and add more 
flavor to the meat.</li> 
<li>We will add oil and herbs to the outside of the skin to help make it 
crispy and add flavor.</li> 
<li>We will not place the bird <em>inside</em> a roasting pan. Instead we will 
place it<em>above</em> a roasting pan so air can flow all around it, cooking 
and browning it properly on the underside.</li> 
<li>We will not truss or tie the bird. We will let the entire surface brown, 
even the armpits and crotch, because nobody wants to eat rubbery skin. This 
will help the thighs and drumsticks cook faster because they need to be cooked 
to a higher temp than the breasts.</li> 
<li>We will roast the bird in a humid, aromatic, smoky atmosphere to hold in 
moisture and add flavor.</li> 
<li>We will prevent the wing and drumstick ends from burning by covering them 
with foil for part of the time.</li> 
<li>We will not cook breast side down as has become popular. It just doesn't 
help, and in fact it harms.</li> 
<li>We will not baste during cooking. It just makes the skin soft. By oiling 
the skin at the start and by cooking at the right temp, we will still get a 
beautiful crisp brown skin.</li> 
<li>We will use a digital thermometer to monitor the bird's temperature to 
make sure it is not overcooked, and not the plastic popup that is set 20&deg;F 
too high, guaranteeing breast meat drier than week-old stuffing. Click here for 
aconversion table from F to C.</li> 
<li>We will remove our turkey from the heat at 160&deg;F instead of 170&deg;F 
to 180&deg;F as most recipes recommend, and it still will be safe. Juicier too. 
The USDA revised its guidelines in 2006 so most cookbooks are out of date.</li> 
<li>We will let it rest 15 to 30 minutes after we take it out of the heat to 
allow the pressure within the fibers of the meat to come down a bit and to keep 
the juices from bursting out when we carve.</li> 
<li>We will not tent it with foil when it is finished cooking because the 
steam trapped under the foil softens the skin. There is plenty of heat in that 
thermal mass to keep it warm while it rests.</li> 
<li>We will slice the breasts <em>across</em> the grain rather than <em>with
</em> the grain to make it even more tender. This means we will not slice the 
breasts while they are still on the bird, we will remove them before slicing.
</li> 
<li>Instead of a gloppy starchy sauce, we will make a succulent <em>thin gravy
</em> the way we would make a soup stock, with giblets and trimmings from the 
bird, onions, carrots, celery, and more. We will put them in a pan under the 
bird to catch its sexy smoky drippings. We will leave the gravy thin and potent 
so it can infiltrate between the muscle fibers rather than sit on top like a 
lump. We will make enough gravy so we can still use it to make that thick 
flour-based goo if the traditionalists insist, and it will be better than ever 
because the base is so much tastier than just plain drippings. And there will 
still be enough gravy for leftovers.</li> 
<li>We will treat the crowd to &quot;muffings&quot; by cooking the stuffing in 
muffin pans and serve everyone an individual muffin shaped stuffing serving, 
crunchy all over.</li> </ol> 
<p>The result will be a magnificent looking, dark mahogany avian, with 
incredibly tender and juicy flesh, delicately and elegantly flavored with 
savory herbs and seductive smoke, annointed with a gravy that eclipses all 
others.</p> 
<h2>Handle raw turkey like kryptonite</h2> 
<p>Treat all raw fowl with great care. There is a good chance that it has <em>
Salmonella, Campylobacter,</em> or some other pathogenic bacteria in it. 
Research shows that about 2/3 of modern poultry has been contaminated by the 
time you get it home. That's just a fact of life nowadays. But don't worry. 
Cooking kills bacteria. If you cook poultry properly, you are perfectly safe.
</p> 
<p>How do so many birds get so yucky? Pathogens are in the soil and in the 
air. Even &quot;free range&quot;, &quot;pasture raised&quot;, 
&quot;natural&quot;, and &quot;organic&quot; birds are easily contaminated 
because they scratch and peck in dirt and grass that is teeming with bacteria, 
and because they eat insects, worms, larvae, seeds, etc. They often step in 
each other's poop and they peck in it. You can't prevent it unless you put them 
in diapers.</p> 
<p>Most turkeys are grown by &quot;independent&quot; farmers who work under 
contract to big brand marketers like Butterball and Perdue. They are highly 
competitive because they know that we shop for bargains so they use efficient, 
inexpensive, mass production farming methods. These concentrated animal feeding 
operations (CAFOs) , sometimes called factory farms, are designed to deliver 
big breasted birds grown to market size in only 4 to 5 months, much faster than 
nature intended, at the lowest possible prices. Birds are then are processed in 
slaughterhouses and high speed disassembly lines. During the process, poop can 
get on their skin, on the gloves of the workers, on the conveyor belts, and in 
the water baths that are used to remove feathers and rinse the meat. It is 
practically impossible to prevent contamination, and it can happen on small 
farms, too.</p> 
<p>So you must handle raw poultry like kryptonite. Thoroughly wash your hands, 
tools, counter tops, cutting boards, sink, platters, and anything that contacts 
uncooked poultry.</p> 
<p>The best solution, pun intended, is to buy an empty spray bottle at the 
drug store and fill it with a dilute solution of water and household bleach. 
Bleach is a powerful sanitizer. That's why they put it in swimming pools.USDA 
recommends a solution of one tablespoon of good old fashioned 5% unscented, 
liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water. After washing your cutting board, 
knives, meat grinder, counters, and sink, thoroughly wet their surfaces with 
the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes. Rinse with clear 
water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels that can be discarded. 
Cloth towels are germ carriers. Store the bleach solution in the bottle, 
tightly sealed, and use it often. It will remain potent for months. And I don't 
care what you've read on the internet, vinegar will not do the job. Click here

<h2>Meat temp: Taste vs. safety</h2> 
<p>Confusion abounds over the proper temperature to which you must heat turkey 
for safety and for max tenderness and juiciness. One of the problems is that
USDA changed the recommended minimum temperature for cooked poultry in 2006. 
Until then USDA said we should cook white meat to 160&deg;F and dark meat to 
180&deg;F, and if you were cooking a whole bird, take it all up to 180&deg;F. 
The new recommendation is 165&deg;F for any and all parts of turkey and 
chicken. That means cookbooks published in 2006 or earlier are wrong. Worse, 
many celebrity cooks seem never to have gotten the word and it is common to 
hear them tell us to desiccate our birds by overcooking them to 180&deg;F.

<p>Dark meat has about 9% fat, 33% more than white meat, so it tastes and 
feels best at about 175&deg;F. White meat is very lean, about 6%, and it dries 
out quickly if it is overcooked. It is at its best texture and juiciness at 
about 155&deg;F, but that's 10&deg;F below the USDA recommendation and I can't 
risk a lawsuit by telling you to serve turkey at that temp. So I will advise 
you to cook it to 160&deg;F and let the temp rise to 165&deg;F while it is 
resting before serving. More on this later.</p> 
<p>USDA wants to keep things simple for us in order to keep us safe. 
Admirable! What USDA doesn't tell you is that microbes start croaking at about 
130&deg;F. The hotter the food gets, the faster the pathogens die. You can 
pasteurize your turkey at 130&deg;F in 2 hours or at 165&deg;F in 2 seconds, 
hence the USDA recommended minimum of 165&deg;F. What the USDA doesn't tell you 
is that you can kill them all if you heat the bird to 160&deg;F for 7 seconds, 
155&deg;F for 23 seconds, or 145&deg;F for about 4 minutes.</p> 
<p>Chefs who cook <em>sous-vide</em> (the ultimate low and slow cooking) know 
this. They put cut up turkey parts in plastic bags, vacuum seal them, and place 
them in water baths at 150 to 160&deg;F for 2 to 3 hours and the results are 
incredibly tender, tasty, and safe. But most of us don't have expensive 
calibrated sous-vide water bath cookers, and even then, if you aren't careful, 
there is risk.</p> 
<p>In 2011, for the first time, USDA gave a nod to the concept that time and 
temp work together to make food safe when it revised the recommended temp for 
pork. They lowered it to 145&deg;F<em>for 3 minutes.</em> The world would be a 
better place if the turkey lobby was as effective as the pork lobby. For more 
on how time and temp work together in the process of pasteurizing meat, read my 
article onfood, knife, and grill safety.</p> 
<h2>Conduction heating and carryover cooking</h2> 
<p>The USDA doesn't factor in carryover either. Carryover is simple physics.
</p> 
<p>In a 325&deg;F oven, the surface of the meat will slowly warm. This warming 
is the process of exciting the molecules so they move faster. It takes time 
because the meat is a combination of water, fat, and protein, and they are good 
insulators.</p> 
<p>As the surface warms it conducts its heat slowly inward to the cooler cells 
beneath, passing it along like a bucket brigade. Excited molecules get their 
neighbors excited by bouncing off them like billiard balls. Slowly the heat 
marches towards the center.</p> 
<p>As the exterior passes the heat along, it loses heat so the bucket brigade 
prevents the surface from zooming up to 325&deg;F. Also, moisture on the 
surface evaporates cooling the surface in the same way sweat cools you off on a 
hot day. If the meat is thin, the heat builds up rapidly. If it is thick, it 
takes much longer to get to the desired temp in the center. The trick is to get 
the center to the target temp without overcooking the exterior. One technique 
is to baste the exterior, but that keeps the skin wet and soft, and we want it 
dry and crisp. Another technique is to cook low and slow. We'll keep the temp 
at 325&deg;F, which is medium, and I'll explain why later.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, the meat keeps cooking after you take it out of the heat. 
The hot outer parts continue to pass their heat inward and in 15 to 30 minutes 
after coming out of the oven, the center of the muscle can rise another 
5&deg;F. The heat also escapes into the air, so we don't want to leave the meat 
sitting around too long.</p> 
<p>In this illustration, on the left we have a piece of meat cooking at 
325&deg;F. It is absorbing heat from all sides, the outer surfaces are hottest 
and the heat is passed to the center by conduction. In the center picture, the 
meat has been removed from the oven. Heat continues to be passed towards the 
center, even though it is sitting at room temp, and some of the heat is 
escaping into the surrounding air. On the right, the meat has come close to an 
even temp throughout and now it is cooling as more heat escapes.</p> 
<p>To be absolutely safe and still have moist and tender whole birds, and to 
make sure nobody sues me, you should<em>serve</em> turkey at 165&deg;F in the 
deepest part of the meat and test it in multiple locations with a good digital 
thermometer. At my house I usually take the meat up to 160&deg;F and let it 
rise 5&deg;F by carryover.</p> 
<h2>Cooking temp</h2> 
<p>I recommend you cook whole turkey at 325&deg;F. Readers know that I love 
low and slow and many of my recipes recommend a 225&deg;F setting. That's a 
great temperature for gently melting tough collagen-based connective tissues 
without getting their protein panties in a bunch and squeezing out moisture 
(see my article onmeat science). But turkey doesn't have the same composition 
as pork ribs or beef brisket, so we don't need to worry about melting tough 
collagens. Turkey can handle higher temps, and higher temps are needed to 
render the fats in the skin in order to crisp it. The higher temp helps brown 
the skin in the short cooking time allotted.</p> 
<p>We want brown skin because when cooking, brown means deep rich, complex 
taste. Browning is the result of a process called theMaillard reaction and it 
really kicks in at about 310&deg;F when amino acids and sugars form scores of 
scrumptuous new compounds. This chemical reaction is responsible for the rich 
flavors in toasted bread, coffee beans, and dark beer.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, we don't want to cook turkey too hot. Recently I have 
been seeing more and more recipes for cooking turkey at high temps, like 
500&deg;F. This just risks incinerating the skin and flies in the face of 
physics as shown in the illustration here. High temps are fine for thin cuts 
like 3/4&quot; steaks because we want the exterior dark with the interior at 
130&deg;F, much lower than turkey. But turkey breasts are much thicker than 
most steaks and we need to allow enough time for the heat to travel to the 
center. At high temps, by the time the heat penetrates, the exterior and outer 
layers are overcooked and dry.</p> 
<p>Besides, at higher temps the window of opportunity opens and closes too 
quickly. The amount of time at which the meat is properly cooked in the center 
is short, and in short order it is overdone. Slow pitches are easier to hit 
than fastballs.</p> 
<p>So 325&deg;F is a nice compromise. High enough to benefit from the Maillard 
reaction on the skin and to melt some of the fat, hot enough to gelatinize 
connective tissues, but not flamethrower hot, not risking a badly overheated 
outside of the meat before the center is cooked.</p> 
<p>If you have a smoker or grill that doesn't get to 325&deg;F (some smokers 
won't, especially gassers), you will need to cook longer. Don't sweat it. The 
skin will still be brown because the Maillard reaction can still take place at 
lower temps, but at a much slower pace. Besides, the smoke is going to darken 
things, too. If you have a pellet smoker that generates its best smoke at about 
200&deg;F or so, start there for about 30 minutes, and then crank it up to 
325&deg;F.</p> 
<h2>Cooking time</h2> 
<p>A clock cannot tell you when food is cooked. Only a thermometer can do this.
 Turkeys are notoriously unpredictable in the wild and only slightly less so in 
the oven. The two most important factors in determining cooking time are the 
cooking temp and the thickness of the thickest piece of meat, the breast. But 
actual cooking time will vary depending on how well it is defrosted, whether or 
not you brined or injected, what temp your fridge is, if it sat at room temp 
for a while, how close your bird is to the gravy pan, how well your cooker 
holds a steady 325&deg;F, the quality of your thermometers, airflow within the 
cooker, humidity in the cooker, and the breast size of your bird.</p> <strong>
Pounds</strong> <strong>Hours at 325</strong>&deg; <strong>F</strong> <br>
 12 
to 14  2 to 2.5 <br>
<br>
 14 to 18  2.5 to 3 <br>
<br>
 18 to 24  3 to 3.5 <br>
<br>  24 to 30  3.5 to 4 <br>
<br>
Add 15 to 30 minutes resting time <br>
<br>

<p>Given all those disclaimers, this table is a <em>rough guide</em> for how 
long it will take to get the temp in the deepest part of the breast to 
160&deg;F and the thigh to 170&deg;F. Do not bet on it. Bet on a good 
thermometer. If you don't have one, don't blame me if your guests get tummy 
aches (or worse), if you keep your guests waiting, or if you serve shoe leather.
</p> 
<p>And please don't ask me how long a stuffed bird will take. I don't test 
recipes with stuffed birds, so I have no idea how long they take. Here's why:
</p> 
<h2>Don't stuff the bird!</h2> 
<p>If you must have bread stuffing (and if you're having me over, you <em>must
</em> have bread stuffing) then cook it on the side (some people insist on 
calling it<em>dressing</em> if it is not in the bird).</p> 
<p>1) If you stuff the bird, the temp in the center of the stuffing must be at 
least 165&deg;F to be safe because juices from the bird get into the stuffing. 
By the time the heat penetrates that far, the breast will be overcooked and 
void of moisture.</p> 
<p>2) An empty cavity allows smoke and flavor to enter the meat from the 
inside as well as the outside.</p> 
<p>3) If you don't stuff you can put herbs and other aromatics in the cavity 
to amp up the flavor. Stuffing does little for flavor.</p> 
<p>4) Stuffing sticks to the ribs of the turkey. If you use the carcass to 
make stock the next day, which you absolutely should do, the bread in the 
stuffing will make the stock unappetizingly cloudy.</p> 
<p>If you cook stuffing outside the bird, you can spread it in a baking pan 
and get more crispy brown bits, the bits everybody wants. Or better still, make 
muffings (see sidebar).</p> 
<h2>How big a bird do you need?</h2> 
<p>There are several variables to consider when deciding how much meat to buy. 
Do you want leftovers? What is your male to female ratio? How many young 
children will there be? How many big eaters will there be? Are adult beverages 
in play? How many appetizers and snacks? What are the side dishes and how many? 
When does the football game start?</p> 
<p>As a rule of thumb, 1 to 1.5 pounds raw weight per person usually will be 
more than enough. When you subtract bones, giblets, and shrinkage, you will 
lose about 20%. I usually plan on 2 pounds per person so those who want 
leftovers can take some home (make sure you have plenty of aluminum foil or 
zipper bags on hand).</p> 
<p>If you need a lot of turkey, and space permits, it is better to cook two 
small birds than one giant bird. They will cook faster and be more tender and 
juicy.</p> 
<p>Here's why: The bigger the bird, the thicker the breasts and the longer it 
takes to cook the center of the breasts to proper doneness. By the time they 
are done, thinner parts are overcooked, and the outer parts of the breasts are 
dry.</p> 
<p>Cooking two smaller birds will actually take less time than one large bird 
and it will not take any longer time than one smaller bird if you get the 
cooker up to the proper temp.</p> 
<h2>What you need to know about turkeys<br>
 before you go shopping</h2> 
<p>Today's grocery store turkeys are the result of decades of selective 
breeding. The Broad Breasted White used by Butterball, Perdue, Smithfield, 
Jennie-O, and most other major brands has been bred smaller to fit modern 
family sizes, with larger breasts to satisfy the demand for white meat, with a 
metabolism that lets them grow to market size rapidly, and with all white 
feathers because dark feathers make black spots on the skin. They account for 
99% of all turkeys on the market.</p> 
<p>Because most people don't own a quality digital thermometer, and, as a 
result, they overcook their turkeys, most manufacturers inject a liquid brine, 
about 2% salt, into their turkeys. Salt is a great flavor amplifier if you 
don't overdo it. The injection of a brine adds liquid helping to keep the meat 
moist. And remarkably, salt helps keep the moisture in. It seems the electrical 
charges in salt alter the structure of the proteins in the meat, a process 
called denaturing, and the denatured proteins become more hydrophilic, meaning 
they glom onto water and hold it tight. Finally, salt has antimicrobial 
properties.</p> 
<p>Because processors are allowed to inject up to 8% of the weight of the 
bird, this also adds to their profit. Let's do the math: If 8% of a 20 pound 
bird is injected brine, that's 1.6 pounds. If the bird sells for $1.25 per 
pound on sale, that's $2 for that salt water, more when it is full price!</p> 
<p>Turkeys that say &quot;basted&quot; or &quot;self-basted&quot; or 
&quot;enhanced&quot; have been injected with a salt solution and possibly 
flavor enhancers and tenderizers. &quot;Kosher&quot; birds have been salted on 
the outside and inside the cavity because it was thought in ancient times that 
this would draw out the blood.</p> 
<p>Now catch this: If a bird has had salt and water injected, the law still 
allows it to be labeled &quot;natural&quot; because salt and water are natural 
ingredients! Remember, this is a country where Congress once decided to 
classify pizza as a vegetable!</p> 
<p>But salt is not evil. It is an &quot;essential nutrient&quot; which means 
it is necessary for good health and you must ingest it because your body 
doesn't make it.<em>Excessive </em>salt consumption can be hazardous, but not 
moderate consumption.</p> 
<p>So let's do the math: An ounce of Butterball turkey (which has neither 
butter nor balls) contains about 65 mg sodium. So an 8 ounce portion of turkey, 
a pretty nice serving, will contain 520 mg. If you are on a low sodium diet,the 
Cleveland Clinic recommends you keep your daily intake down to 2,000 mg, so 
that serving of turkey is only 1/4 of the recommended daily amount<em>for 
someone whose doctor has told them to watch their salt intake</em>. No sweat. 
For the rest of us? Chow down!</p> 
<p>Nowadays finding a bird that has not been salted is almost a mission 
impossible. To get a bird that is not pumped, you need to special order it, go 
to a specialty store like Whole Foods, or buy it directly from a farmer. Some 
butchers develop relationships with local farmers and will take orders for 
fresh birds. Another good source is a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) 
organization which you can find throughLocalHarvest.org.</p> 
<p>For more about salt and how important it is to your health, read my article 
on theZen of Salt. Also recommended, my articles on the Zen of Brines and the 
Zen of Injecting.</p> 
<h2>Heritage breeds?</h2> 
<p>All turkeys are descendants of the wild turkey <em>Meleagris gallopavo. 
</em>As with other animals (hogs for instance) and vegetables (tomatoes for 
instance), farmers are rediscovering abandoned &quot;heritage&quot; breeds and 
seeds. Narragansett and Bourbon Red are two of several heritage turkeys that 
are making a comeback, but they are still hard to find. They are closer to wild 
turkeys, with smaller breasts, darker and more flavorful meat that some people 
call gamey. Try one before you serve it to the gang on Turkey Day. They are 
also much more expensive. But beware. The term &quot;heritage&quot; is not 
government-regulated and there is nothing to stop unscrupulous merchants from 
labeling any old turkey as &quot;heritage&quot;.</p> 
<h2>Fresh or frozen?</h2> 
<p>&quot;Fresh&quot; poultry means, according to USDA, that the bird has not 
been taken below 26&deg;F by the processor. At that point it is pretty hard 
(remember, freezing temp of water is 32&deg;F), but not rock solid because of 
the proteins and other compounds in the liquids, not to mention the injected 
salt, prevent it from freezing completely. But ice crystals will still have 
formed. USDA inspectors allow up to 2&deg;F tolerance when testing birds in 
commerce, so a &quot;fresh&quot; turkey can be held as low as 24&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Ice crystals are larger than water molecules, and they are sharp. When ice 
crystals form, the water expands and the sharp edges punch holes in muscle 
fibers, allowing precious moisture to escape. That's the pink liquid in the 
bag. Called &quot;purge&quot;, it is mostly myoglobin, a protein fluid that 
helps keep meat moist. We won't waste it. It will go in the gravy, but I would 
rather have it in the muscles where it belongs. To make matters worse, some 
grocers allow turkeys to thaw a bit so they<em>feel</em> fresh.</p> 
<p>I think this phony &quot;fresh&quot; turkey business is bunk and USDA is 
allowing marketers to deceive the public.</p> 
<p>Sometimes you can buy <em>truly fresh</em> turkeys with no ice crystals and 
no purge from a farmer or specialty butcher who has chilled them to between 
32&deg;F and 38&deg;. You may be able to find truly fresh turkeys raised on 
Amish-owned family farms. Amish farmers don't use electricity so the birds 
aren't processed on fast moving disassembly lines and they aren't up late 
surfing the net and doing things that get them overexcited. They're plucked and 
cleaned by hand and are largely free of pinfeathers.</p> 
<p>To get a truly fresh turkey, usually you have to order it and the butcher 
or farmer will give you a pickup date. In Chicago, I occasionally drive to 
John's Live Poultry and Egg Market where I can pick a live bird, have it 
weighed, slaughtered, and dressed on the spot. I get to keep the head and feet 
too.</p> 
<p>The problem is that, when an animal dies the muscles can't get the blood 
laden oxygen they expect so they get stiff. This<em>rigor mortis</em> usually 
sets in within an hour or so, and it doesn't go away until about 12 hours 
later, so you don't want to eat a fresh killed bird. Wait 24 hours.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But fresh meat doesn't stay fresh forever. Buy a truly fresh turkey only if 
you are certain it has been killed within a week of the date you will consume 
it.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, in an efficient slaughterhouse operation, turkeys are 
flash frozen in extreme cold. This process forms smaller ice crystals and that 
helps prevent purge. I would rather have a bird that was flash frozen right 
after slaughter than a so-called &quot;fresh&quot; bird that has been chilled 
to 26&deg;F and is really only partially frozen, or a truly fresh bird chilled 
to 34&deg;F that has been sitting around in the fridge for a couple of weeks.
</p> 
<p>Bottom line: Proper cooking is far more important than having a fresh bird.

<h2>Thawing</h2> 
<p>To thaw a frozen turkey, place the bird, still in its plastic shipping bag, 
in a large roasting pan in the refrigerator. You need the pan because the bags 
always seems to leak. Allow 24 hours in the fridge for every 4 pounds. If you 
don't want to do the math, just put it in the fridge 7 days before the day you 
will eat it. That's a bit more time than needed, but hey, when you want to 
catch a train, you get to the station before the train does, right? Most turkey 
disasters I hear about are because the bird has not defrosted properly. There 
are faster ways to defrost a bird discussed in my article on thawing.</p> 
<p>A day before cooking, strip off the plastic bag and remove the organs and 
neck from both the front and rear cavities. That's the deep center and the last 
part to thaw, so removing them will help insure that the interior is melted. 
Just leave the neck and giblets in the pan. We'll use them later. If you do not 
plan to submerge the bird in a brine, sprinkle the skin with salt. This will 
help the skin crisp during cooking because it breaks down the structure of the 
skin and dries it out. It will also help season the outer layers and denature 
the proteins so they hold water better. Drape the bird in plastic wrap and let 
it thaw in the fridge.</p> 
<p>As much as it pains me to tell you this, you <em>can</em> cook a frozen 
turkey, but expect the exterior to be overcooked by the time the center is 
cooked to a safe temp, so make sure you have gravy. Here are the rules: (1) You 
absolutely positively must use a meat thermometer for this maneuver; (2) you 
cannot stuff the bird; (3) you may have to cook for an hour before you can 
remove the giblet package and neck, but you really should get them out as 
quickly as possible, especially if they are in plastic, which can melt; (3) 
cooking time will be 1.5 to 2.0 times as long.</p> 
<h2><strong>Ingredients f</strong><strong>or the gravy</strong></h2> 
<p>3 quarts [2.8 L] water<br>
1 cup [56 ml] apple juice<br>
2 onions, skin on, 
ends removed, cut into quarters<br>
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 2 
inch lengths<br>
1 stalk of celery, leaves and all, cut into 2 inch lengths<br>

1 tablespoon [15 ml] dried sage leaves, crumbled (do not use powdered herbs, 
they will cloud the broth)<br>
1 tablespoon [15 ml] dried thyme leaves<br>
2 
whole dried bay leaves</p> 
<p><em><strong>About the liquids. </strong>You can ubstitute some of the water 
with chicken stock, vegetable stock, or a bottle of a white wine. I usually get 
a white wine from the closeout bin of the local liquor store. Oxidized white 
wine is fine; in fact I think it adds depth. Just don't use anything that has 
turned to vinegar. And never use red wine unless you want purple turkey! I have 
occasionally added mushrooms (fresh or dried) to the gravy, too. You can 
substitute a small handful of celery leaves for the celery stalk. This is a 
good way to get rid of them.</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>About the onion skins.</strong> Onion skins contain a pigment 
that darkens the gravy. Using them in making stocks is an old chef trick. In 
fact they are sometimes used as fabric dyes. If the skins are musty, or the 
underlayer is mushy or rotten, discard them.</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Add no salt.</strong> Drippings from the meat will have salt, 
so wait until you taste the final gravy and add salt at the end if you think it 
needs more.</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Ingredients for the wet rub</strong></h2> 
<p>4 tablespoons of Simon &amp; Garfunkel rub<br>
4 tablespoons of vegetable 
oil or olive oil<br>
 1 tablespoon table salt</p> 
<p><em><strong>About the rub.</strong> Click the link above for the recipe.
</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Optional.</strong> If you don't want to bother making it (you 
really should have a bottle on hand at all times), just use a simple blend of 
herbs, perhaps 1.5 tablespoons finely chopped or powdered sage (fresh or dried) 
and1.5 tablespoons thyme leaves (fresh or dried).</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Ingredients for the bird</strong></h2> 
<p>1 turkey, any size<br>
1 medium onion, cut in quarters, skin on<br>
 3 
cloves of garlic, coarsely chopped<br>
2 large sprigs of fresh sage or thyme, 
about 3 to 4&quot; long<br>
 Peel of one orange or lemon<br>
 4 ounces [113 gm] 
or so of hardwood or fruitwood chips</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Preparing the gravy</h2> 
<p>If you wish, you can do this a day in advance.</p> 
<p>Whatever you do, don't skip the gravy. I know this whole approach may sound 
a little goofy, but trust me: This nectar is a show stopper. First time out of 
the gate, follow my recipe closely until you get the concept. The truth is, now 
that I've made this umpteen times, I no longer measure the ingredients.</p> 
<p>This gravy is not the thick and pasty stuff made with flour that sits on 
top of the meat and forms pudding skin. This gravy is a thin, flavorful broth 
that penetrates the meat, making it incredibly moist and tasty. And if Grandma 
insists on the thick glop, there is more than enough of my gravy to mix with 
flour to make her happy. I'll show you how, reluctantly, below.</p> 
<p>There is almost always leftover gravy that you can freeze. It makes a 
killer soup base or stock for cooking rice, risotto, couscous, or whenever a 
recipe calls for stock. I use it to make the gravy forturkey pot pies with the 
leftovers.</p> 
<p><strong>Do this</strong><br>
 1) After the bird has thawed, open the bag it 
came in and pour the juices into the pan in which it was sitting. Even if they 
bird was salted, save those the juices. They will not be too salty.</p> 
<p>2) If there is a plastic pop-up thermometer, remove it and discard it. If 
you rely on it you will be eating balsa wood. If there is a gizmo holding the 
tops of the drumsticks together, remove it. By holding the thighs and drums 
tight to the body, it prevents them from cooking properly and keeps the skin in 
the bird's crotch from darkening and crisping. Yes, I know the books tell you 
to truss the drumsticks. They're wrong. I'll explain why later.</p> 
<p>3) Pull the stuff out the cavities. Check both front and rear openings. 
Typically you'll find the neck and a bag of &quot;giblets&quot; in there. Put 
the neck in the pan. The bag usually contains the heart (looks like a heart), 
the gizzard (two marbles connected in the middle), and the liver (it is the 
floppy, shiny thing). Put everything except the liver in the gravy pan. The 
liver will<em>not</em> be used for the gravy. Freeze it in a zipper bag and 
save it along with other chicken and duck livers until you have enough to make 
a nice p&acirc;t&eacute;, or toss it in a pan with some oil, cook it, and feed 
it to the dog.</p> 
<p>4) Remove &quot;the part that goes over the fence last&quot;, a.k.a. 
&quot;the Pope's nose&quot;, and trim excess skin and fat from around both 
cavities, front and rear, and put them in the pan along with the neck and the 
juices. Then whack off the wing tips at the first joint and toss them in the 
pool. There's a lot of flavor in them. Don't worry about the fat, you can skim 
it later.</p> 
<p>5) Add the rest of the gravy ingredients to the pan and refrigerate. We 
will use it when we cook the bird.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Injecting and brining</h2> 
<p>If you wish, you can do this a day in advance.</p> 
<p>Injecting and wet brining are two excellent ways to amp up your bird. Since 
most grocery store turkeys have already been injected with brine at the 
slaughterhouse, there is no need to soak it in brine or inject salt at home. 
But if you get a bird that has not been injected, I recommend that you do it.
</p> 
<p>Even if it has been injected with a salt solution at the slaughterhouse, 
you can still inject it with butter or oil. As with salt, oil amplifies 
flavors. I've included complete instructions for wet brining and injecting in 
the sidebar at right.</p> 
<h2>Preparing the wet rub and the bird</h2> 
<p>If you wish, you can do this a day in advance.</p> 
<p>A dry rub is a mix of spices and herbs rubbed into meat, but for turkey, 
we're going to use a wet rub, a mix of herbs, spices, and oil. Wet rubs are 
especially effective because many of the flavors in herbs and spices do not 
dissolve in water, but they do dissolve in oil. This is especially true of 
green herbs. Turkey and herbs get along like peanut butter and jelly. Click 
here to read about theZen of Herbs and Spices.</p> 
<p>The wet rub goes under the skin so they can be in intimate contact with the 
muscle tissue and don't have to fight their way through fatty skin. Then we'll 
put some rub on top of the skin to flavor everybody's favorite part and because 
oil helps crisp the skin.</p> 
<p>I recommend you use my Simon &amp; Garfunkel poultry rub blend. It's a mix 
of parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (sing it), with oregano, basil, bay leaf, 
black pepper, and sugar.</p> 
<p>If you want to use your own favorite rub, use something without salt if the 
bird has been salted at the factory or you have salted it with a brine or 
injection. My Simon &amp; Garfunkel rub has no salt. Remember, you can always 
add salt, but you can't take it away. Click here formore about rubs.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, if the sage in the garden hasn't frozen by Thanksgiving, I'll 
put olive oil or butter and several whole fresh sage leaves under the skin 
instead of a wet rub and use the wet rub on the outside of the skin only. If 
you click here and look at the picture of thefinished bird up close you can see 
the sage leaves under the skin. They taste great and look kewl. People will ask 
about the secret ingredient.</p> 
<p><strong>Do this</strong><br>
 1) Mix the herb blend with the oil and let it 
sit for a few hours if you have the time. That helps break down the cells in 
the herbs and releases their flavors, but this is not a necessity because the 
flavors will marry while on the bird. Why oil and not butter? Butter is not 
pure oil, it has water in it so it will not brown as well as other oils. Olive 
oil or cooking oil do the job of delivering herbs to the muscle tissues just 
fine. The herbs are where the flavor is.</p> 
<p>2) If your bird has been swimming in brine, pull it out. Pat the skin dry, 
take off your Superbowl ring, and gently push the herbs and oil under the skin. 
Spread it out and work it as far down to the thighs and legs as possible. Try 
to avoid leaving behind large clumps.</p> 
<p>3) Spread the remaining rub on top of the skin. If you run out, rub the 
exterior with olive oil or vegetable oil and sprinkle it gently with a little 
black pepper, sage, and thyme. Then sprinkle salt on the skin to help it crisp.
</p> 
<p>4) Do not tie the legs together. Most turkeys come with an armature holding 
the tops of the drums together. And most cookbooks tell you to tie them up if 
they didn't come that way. This just doesn't make sense. Here's why.</p> 
<p>Dark meat is best at about 175&deg;F, but if you tie the drums together you 
pin the thighs tight against the body of the bird and they'll take longer to 
cook. So if you remove the bird when the breasts are 160&deg;F, the thighs will 
also be about 160&deg;F. But if you let their freak flag fly, heat will 
infiltrate them from all sides and, because they are thinner than the breasts, 
they will be at 170&deg;F when the breasts hit 160&deg;F.</p> 
<p>Some chefs tell you to put a Wagnerian breast plate made of foil on the 
white meat in order to reflect heat so the thighs can get ahead of them. Now 
that is<em>really</em> goofy. A thin layer of foil is not going to reflect much 
heat nor is it going to be much of an insulator. All that will do is retard the 
browning and crisping of the skin.</p> 
<p>Some other chefs tell you to put ice bags on the breasts before cooking in 
order to chill them so that the thighs will have a head start. One<em>New York 
Times</em> expert whom I normally worship even use Ace bandages to hold the 
icebags in place so the poor turkey looks like was up all night drinking Wild 
Turkey. Just letting the thighs free so hot air can surround them will do the 
job just fine, thank you. And doing so has the added bonus of letting the 
crotch area brown.</p> 
<h2>Setting up your grill or smoker</h2> 
<p>You absolutely, positively do not want the bird sitting directly above the 
flame or coals unless you have always secretly wanted to run avian crematorium. 
The best arrangement for a grill is what is called a2-zone setup. The grill has 
a hot side with direct heat underneath it, and a cooler side where the heat 
flows in from the hot side. We call them the direct zone and the indirect zone.
</p> 
<p>The meat goes in the indirect zone and roasts by convection airflow 
circulating all around the bird rather than by direct radiation from the flame. 
If you have a smoker, they are usually designed for indirect cooking. If you 
have a grill, you need to set it up for 2 zones.</p> 
<p>Long ago you should have done dry runs sans food with your grill so that by 
now you can hit two target temps: 325 and 225&deg;F. Almost all my recipes call 
for one or the other and becuase only pellet grills have a thermostat control, 
you need to play thermostat. If you haven'tcalibrated your system, click the 
link and practice long before you try to cook anything.</p> 
<p>When setting up for 2-zone cooking, I normally recommend you put a water 
pan under the meat. It acts as a heat sink, absorbing energy and moderating 
fluctuations. A water pan also puts humidity in the atmosphere to reduce 
evaporative cooling and helps keep the meat moist. If you have a small grill, 
the water pan can actually sit between the flame and the meat, casting a heat 
shadow above it so the meat doesn't overheat.</p> 
<p>For this recipe, we replace the water in the pan with the fixins for our 
special gravy and it will collect dripping further enriching the gravy. This 
gravy/drip pan should have at least 3.5 quart capacity and must be large enough 
to fit under the entire bird. The best choices are stainless steel, ceramic, or 
CorningWare. Be forewarned, the pan it will get smoky and need serious 
scrubbing. Don't use copper because it can react with the salts and acids in 
the gravy. I have used a disposable aluminum pan and noticed no off flavors, 
but I now have a stainless steel roasting pan that I use just for outdoor 
cooking because I got tired of sleeeping on the couch.</p> 
<p>You <em>never</em> want to put the bird in liquid on on the bottom of a 
roasting pan. If you put it in liquid, you will boil the back and end up with 
soggy flavorless meat and inedible skin. If you put it in a dry pan, it will 
stick and the dripping oils will fry the back, usually overcooking it. So 
you'll need a grate for holding the bird. You can use one from your grill, or 
even one from your indoor oven.</p> 
<p>The tricky part is arranging everything. Because there are so many 
different grill designs I can't go through all the options, so grasp the 
science and adapt it to your own rig. The ideal setup is to place the bird on a 
rack 2 to 3&quot; above the pan so heat and smoke can travel between them. If 
the bird is any lower, the mass of the cooler gravy, evaporation from its 
surface, and the sides of the pan will conspire to block heat, airflow, and 
smoke and you will end up with a pale, soggy, undercooked bottom.</p> 
<p>The traditional turkey roasting configuration is a V-shaped rack that sits 
in a deep roasting pan with water in the pan to keep the drippings from 
burning. Below is a picture from the FoodNetwork's website. It is a recipe for 
skin as pale as a Seattle sunbather on the bottom and sides, and undercooked 
dark meat. I can see you nodding in recognition from here.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Dr. Greg Blonder, is a physicist, entrepreneur, former Chief Technical 
Advisor at the legendary Bell Labs, food lover, and the AmazingRibs.com science 
advisor and mythbuster. He measured the temps at different levels above the 
liquid in a 3&quot; tall pan of water.</p> 
<p>Even though the oven was 325&deg;F, the liquid never reached boiling temp 
in the time it took to cook a turkey. That's because air is a lousy conductor 
of heat. You can put your hand in a 325&deg;F oven, but don't put it in 
325&deg;F oil. Because the evaporation of water from the surface cools the 
liquid in the same way sweat cools us on a hot day, the temp of the gravy may 
never get above 175&deg;F.</p> 
<p>As you can see from the illustration, if the bird is below the lip of the 
pan and about 2&quot; above the gravy, the bottom of the bird is in 240&deg;F 
high humidity air, 85&deg;F cooler than the top of the bird which is chugging 
away nicely in dry heat. That's why turkey backs are so often as flabby as an 
elephant's.</p> 
<p>Even if you lace the bird on a grate on the lip of the pan, the bottom will 
still be much cooler than the top and will almost certainly be undercooked. He 
did experiments with a shallow pan and got similar results.</p> 
<p>In order to heat the bottom of the bird properly, if you are using a 
3&quot; pan with liquid as I recommend, you need to get the meat at least 2 to 
3&quot; above the pan.</p> 
<p>If you can't get your bird above the pan, you should start it breast side 
down and turn it over after an hour. Another option is to just remove the drip 
pan about 20 minutes before the bird is finished and put its back above direct 
heat. Just be sure to watch it carefully so it doesn't burn and check the temp 
in the breast before bringing it in.</p> 
<p> <strong>Charcoal grill setup. </strong>Put the drip pan on one side of the 
charcoal grate and the charcoal on the other side and the meat on the food 
grate above the drip pan. I do not recommend putting the meat and the drip pan 
in the center. It is too easy to burn the thighs and wings that way. See my 
article onthe best setup for a charcoal grill.</p> 
<p> <strong>Gas grill setup. </strong>Put the drip pan on the flame deflectors 
below the food grate. The bird roosts on the food grate above. See my article on
the best setup for a gas grill.</p> 
<p> <strong>Bullet smoker setup. </strong>If you are using a bullet shaped 
water smoker like a Weber Smokey Mountain, you can use the built-in water pan 
for the drip pan. See my article onthe best setup for a Weber Smokey Mountain.
</p> 
<p> <strong>Gas smoker setup. </strong>Put the turkey on a shelf high up in 
the cabinet and the gravy pan on the bottom shelf. You won't need the built-in 
water pan. You'll probably need to set the dial on high.</p> 
<p> <strong>Offset barrel smoker setup. </strong>Put the drip pan on the 
bottom of the cooking chamber under the cooking grate. See my article onthe 
best setup for an offset smoker.</p> 
<p> <strong>Pellet smoker setup. </strong>Put the drip pan on top of the big 
deflector plate under the cooking grate and put the bird on the cooking grate.
</p> 
<p>If none of these works for you, try to raise the bird up by placing it on 
an oven rack sitting on top of several<em>empty</em> tall beer cans (don't 
write to me if you don't know how to empty them). If they are clean, they can 
sit right in the drip pan.</p> 
<p>Beware! A disposable aluminum pan will not hold the rack and a bird without 
collapsing, so if you use a disposable pan, it must go under the grill grate 
and the bird must go on top of the grill grate. That, or you must rest a 
cooking grate on empty beer cans.</p> 
<h2>Finally! Let's cook that bird!</h2> 
<p>Finally! All the pregame activities are over. It's time to get down to 
business. You want to begin by preheating the oven about 5 hours before your 
guests are ready to sit down. Yes, your grill or smoker is really an oven. Get 
over it.</p> 
<p>1) Crank your oven up to 325&deg;F or as close as possible as measured at 
the level of the cooking grate by a digital thermometer. Do not measure the 
temp using the cheap thermometer in the lid unless you plan to eat the lid. 
There can be a great difference between the grate temp and the lid temp.</p> 
<p>2) When it is hot, clean the grate you will cook the bird on <em>before you 
put the drip pan in.</em> Week-old grease and gunk the cooking grates will not 
add the kind of complexity you want in your gravy. Now put the drip pan and all 
the gravy fixins onto the cooker at least 2 to 3&quot; below the bird if 
possible.</p> 
<p>3) If you have a leave-in digital thermometer with a probe on a wire, 
insert the probe into the breast so the tip is in the center of the thickest 
part of the breast, being careful not to touch the ribs. Digital thermometers 
have small sensors and they are very close to the tip, so they are by far the 
best. The sensitive areas of a dial thermometer are too big to be accurate.</p> 
<p>4) Put the onion (remember to quarter it), garlic, orange peel, and fresh 
herbs into the cavity. These aromatics will release aromas and they will 
penetrate the meat from the inside of the cavity, along with the smoke.Do not 
cram them in so tightly that hot air and smoke can't circulate inside. If you 
must, leave something out.</p> 
<p>5) Grab 4 pieces of aluminum foil, each about 8&quot; square, and coat one 
side with vegetable oil so it won't stick. Cover the tops of the wings and 
drumsticks with the foil. You did lop off the wing tips and toss them in the 
gravy, didn't you? The foil will keep these skinny parts from burning. You'll 
take the foil off after an hour, so the skin will brown and crisp.</p> 
<p>6) Now add your smoke wood. Turkey loves smoke, but too much can ruin it in 
a hurry, and there is is a fine line. The first time you try this recipe I beg 
you to go easy on the smoke wood. Overdo it and the bird will taste like an 
ashtray.</p> 
<p>I've had good luck with apple, alder, peach, cherry, and oak. Avoid 
mesquite, and hickory. They'll work, but I think they're a bit too strong for 
delicate lean meats like turkey.</p> 
<p>On a charcoal grill or smoker, you may not need to add wood at all. The 
charcoal will probably give you all the smoke flavor you need. If you do add 
wood, you can toss it right on the coals. 2 to 4 ounces by weight should be 
enough. Smoke adheres to wet surfaces, so add the wood at the start of the cook.
</p> 
<p>On a gas grill you'll need 4 to 8 ounces of wood. You may decide after 
tasting it that you want more on your next cook, but don't ruin the first one 
with too much smoke.</p> 
<p>On my gas grill I usually place one golf-ball sized chunk of wood right on 
a burner in the flame. Chunks smolder slowly, but if you do not have chunks, 
you can use chips or pellets.</p> 
<p>To use chips or pellets, make a little pouch of aluminum foil and poke 
holes in one side. There is no need to soak the wood. Wood does not absorb much 
water. That's why they make boats out of it. Put the packet as close to the 
flame as possible. Click here formore on The Zen of Wood.</p> 
<p>7) Place the bird on the cooking rack, breast side up, close the lid and 
don't open it for an hour. That means no basting. Not if you want crispy skin. 
Remember, basting just makes the skin wet and soft.</p> 
<p>8) After an hour, open the cooker and remove the aluminum foil from the 
wings and drums. This lets them brown properly and you will have potato chip 
crunchy skin on your wings.</p> 
<p>If you don't have a thermometer on a wire already in the breast, spot check 
the temperature with a good digital instant read thermometer by inserting the 
probe into the deepest part of the breast. Push the tip past the center and 
pull it out slowly. The lowest temp is the one to watch for. You can do this 
occasionally as needed.You won't harm anything by peaking.</p> 
<p>If necessary, add a quart of <em>boiling</em> water to the gravy pan. Don't 
add cold water or you can cool off the cooking chamber. Make sure there are at 
least 2 inches of liquid in the pan at all times.<em> Do not let the onions and 
other solids in the pan burn!</em> Let them get dark, but not black. While 
you're under the hood, if you are using charcoal add another 15 to 20 chunks 
every hour. Resist the temptation to reach for the wood chips.</p> 
<p>If you fear that the bird is progressing too slowly and you are having 
trouble keeping the temp up to 325&deg;F, preheat your indoor oven to 325&deg;F 
and move the bird and the gravy inside. Finishing it this way is fine. You will 
not lose you pitmaster card. The smoke flavor is already in the bird so now 
your focus must be on making sure it is not overcooked.</p> 
<p>9) As the meat temp approaches 160&deg;F in the center of the breast, tilt 
the bird and drain the cavity into the gravy. Now check temps all over, 
especially the back which can be a bit soggy or even undercooked if it is very 
close to the water. If the back isn't 160&deg;F, remove the gravy pan and put 
the bird over direct heat to firm it up. This should take no more than 20 
minutes or so, but watch things, because without that buffer of water, you can 
burn the back in a hurry.</p> 
<p>Now it is time to move the bird to the cutting board or a platter. Pick a 
platter with a lip that contain the copious juices. Let the bird rest at least 
15 minutes before you start carving. Resting allows the pressure that has built 
up inside the meat to ease off a bit so the juices don't come gushing out. A 
lot of books say you should put a foil tent on the bird.Don't do it. This just 
makes the skin soggy. There is plenty of heat in the meat that it will not go 
cold in 15 minutes or longer.</p> 
<p>If you are going over the river and through the woods with your bird, or if 
your bird finishes early, read about how to keep it hot with afaux Cambro.</p> 
<p>10) While the meat is resting, <em>carefully</em> remove the gravy pan from 
the cooker. Pour the gravy through a strainer into a large pot or saucepan. Let 
it sit for about 10 minutes and with a large spoon or basting bulb, remove most 
of the fat. You'll never get it all, so don't obsess. Besides, fat brings 
flavor. Now taste it. It should be rich and flavorful. If you find it too weak 
(unlikely) bring it to a boil and cook it down a bit. Taste again and add salt 
only at the last minute. If you add salt and then reduce it, it will be too 
salty.</p> 
<p>I pour the gravy into a coffee carafe to keep it warm especially when I 
have to go to someone else's house for dinner. The fat rises in the thermos, so 
I can just pour some off before serving, or shake it up to mix it in. When you 
are ready to serve the bird, you can transfer some of the gravy to a gravy boat 
or serving bowl if you don't like the looks of the carafe.</p> 
<p>As proof of its goodness, when you chill the leftovers it will solidify 
into a jelly. That's what happens to melted collagens, they turn to gelatin, 
and collagens bring flavor and texture to the table. See my article onmeat 
science for more on the subject.</p> 
<p>Please resist the temptation to thicken this gravy with flour or 
cornstarch. If the idea is to moisten meat, starchy sauces just don't get the 
job done. Starches are large molecules and they can't penetrate the tiny pores 
in the meat. The gravy just floats on top like a life preserver after the ship 
has gone down. My thin gravy will soak into the meat and add much more flavor. 
After you taste my gravy, you won't do the thick high school cafeteria stuff 
again. But if there are hardened traditionalists in the house, in the sidebar I 
have included instructions on how to satisfy them.</p> 
<h2>Carving</h2> 
<p>The first thing to do is look at the bird and remember who is winning this 
contest and remind yourself that you are smarter than a dead turkey. It is not 
hard once you understand the logic. Go ahead and parade the whole bird around 
the room and take a few bows, but do the carving in the kitchen, not on the 
dining table. You need elbow room, you don't need adoration or the heckling, 
and you certainly don't need to ruin the tablecloth.</p> 
<p>The second thing to do is to reach for the best carving knife you own. Some 
folks prefer an electric knife, but I prefer a good carving knife. Just make 
sure it is sharp or the skin will give you fits. Good carving knives should be 
professionally sharpened every year or so depending on how often you use them. 
A honing steel is no substitute for a real sharpening. You can do it yourself 
and I recommend some sharpening devices in my article aboutrequired kitchen 
tools, or you can take your knives (and lawn mower blade) to a pro once a year.
</p> 
<p>I have a nice Messermeister Meridian Elite 5 Knife Set but, don't tell my 
professional chef friends, the knife I reach for most is my cheap Rapala 
Soft-Grip 7.5&quot;. This cheapo blade has a thin flexible dangerously sharp 
blade, a wicked sharp tip, and it's only about $16. It is not strong enough to 
cut through bone, but there is nothing better for cutting things off bones. 
When it's dirty, it goes in the dishwasher and you can't do that with the fancy 
knives. When it is dull I hone it and when it no longer holds a razor edge, I 
chuck it and get a new one. To see all the different sizes available,click here.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Below I will describe the process of carving a turkey (BTW, carving is much 
easier if you butterfly the bird or break it down into parts before you even 
cook it). Click here tosee an excellent step by step slideshow of the process.
</p> 
<p>The goal is to get as much of the meat off the bones as possible. You want 
to slice it across the grain so it is easier to chew, and you want as many 
pieces as possible to have a bit of tasty skin.</p> 
<p>1) Hone the knife with a honing steel. A sharp knife has a razor thin edge, 
and with use that edge can bend. A honing steel can straighten it out. A honing 
steel is a rod that has a sandpaper like surface. I know you've see TV chefs 
hone knives by crossing the steel and knife in front of them and zip zop, 
they're done. Don't try it. It's not accurate and it's a good way to add your 
bodily fluids to the gravy.</p> 
<p>Begin by placing the tip of the rod on a table and hold it vertical, 
perpindicular to the table. Hold the knife by the handle firmly in your other 
hand. Rest the part of the knife closest to your hand against the top of the 
steel and tilt it to a 45&deg; angle. Then roll your wrist so it is halfway 
between 45&deg; and the steel, about 22.5&deg;. Draw the knife slowly towards 
your body gently sliding it downward towards the table at the same time. Hne 
the entire blade, right to the tip. Repeat the process on the other side of the 
blade. Hone each side alternatively about 3 or 4 times.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>2) After the meat has rested, you can begin to carve. You will need a 
cutting board with gutters to catch the ample juices, and a serving platter or 
2. Let's start with the dark meat. Take a paper towel and grab the top of a 
drumstick and bend it until the joint between it and the thigh is visible. Flex 
it back and forth until you have a good clear shot at the knee from behind. 
Sever the meat around the joint, and then cut between the ball and socket to 
remove the leg.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>3) You can serve the drumstick whole for the cavemen like me, or you can 
stand it on the meaty end and slice downward, removing the meat. I usually 
carve one and leave one whole.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>4) Now pull out those pieces of stiff cartilage with your fingers. Repeat 
the process with the other leg.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>5) Now hold the thigh and cut through the skin that connects it to the 
body. Bend the thigh back to find the hip joint. Cut through the ball joint 
removing the thigh.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>6) You can serve the thigh whole, but then the choicest pieces of dark meat 
go to only 2 guests. If you have more people who want thigh meat, you need to 
remove the bone so you can slice the meat. To do this, flip the thigh skin side 
down, and run the knife around the bone and under it until you can lift it out.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>7) Now turn the thigh skin side up and cut it into slices across the grain. 
Repeat with the other thigh.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>8) Now grabbing a wing, bend it back to locate the shoulder joint and cut 
through the tendons holding together the ball and socket.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>9) Now for the breasts. The old fashioned method was to cut slices off the 
breasts while they were still attached to the carcass. There are several things 
wrong with this approach. First of all, it is awkward. It is hard to get even 
slices especially as your knife approaches the rib cage, which is curved. The 
process is even more awkward because the carcass is wobbly. Besides, it's not 
fair because the person who gets the first slice gets most of the skin! The old 
fashioned method has you cutting<em>with the grain</em>, and slices cut with 
the grain is always chewier than slices cut<em>across the grain</em>. The 
better plan is to remove each side of the breast from the carcass and then cut 
it into beautiful slices across the grain so it is more tender. Here's how: In 
the middle of the two lobes is the breast bone, sometimes called the keel bone. 
Cut down along one side of the breast bone with long strokes until the knife 
hits the rib cage.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>10) Then tilt the knife and work along the rib cage with long strokes until 
the breast falls away in one football shaped hunk. On the fron the knife will 
slide along the wishbone. Don't forget to pull it out from under the skin flap!
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>11) Lay each breast skin side up on a cutting board and slice it across the 
grain in slices at least 1/4&quot;. I like thicker slices, especially if the 
meat is tender. But there is a trick to slicing it properly (I'll bet you're 
not surprised to hear that). Remember that we loosened the skin so it is no 
longer attached to the meat? If we're not careful the skin will slip slide 
around and you won't get neat slices with skin with each slice of meat. The 
trick is to have a really sharp knife. Place it on the center of the breast 
near its handle. Place the thumb and forefinger of your free hand on either 
side of the knife pressing down on the skin gently. In one gentle steady 
stroke, with slight downward pressure, draw the knife toward yourself across 
the skin, cutting down through it and into the meat. If you use a dull knife or 
a serrated knife, the skin will move around. This takes a bit of practice.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>12) When you have the meat cut, re-assemble it into a breast shaped 
presentation in order to keep the meat warm. If you are careful, you can slide 
your knife under the assembly and lift the whole thing onto the serving 
platter. On second thought, play it safe and use a spatula.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>13) Just before serving the bird, give yourself a reward. Flip the carcass 
over so the backbone is facing up. Run your fingers along the sides of the 
backbone and near the joints where the wings were attached, right under the 
shoulder blades, you'll find tender, juicy blobs of meat, each about the size 
and shape of the meat from a large oyster, hence the nickname,<em> turkey 
oysters</em>. You can pop them out with your fingers. Savor them for a job well 
done.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>14) Now pour <em>a little gravy</em> over the top of the meat in the 
platter, enough to moisten it but not drown it.</p> 
<h2>Leftovers and that valuable carcass</h2> 
<p>Do not discard the carcass. There is plenty of meat left and plenty of 
flavor inside those bones. Put it in the fridge. Don't leave it sitting at room 
temp for more than 30 minutes.</p> 
<p>1) Once the guests are gone (or the next day if you're beat), wash your 
hands well, and begin pulling all the remaining meat off the carcass. Set it 
aside forsmoked turkey supper salad, smoked turkey pot pies, turkey sandwiches, 
turkeyfajitas, turkey salad, turkey soup, or pulled turkey. The meat freezes 
well if wrapped tightly in plastic wrap or a zipper bag.</p> 
<p>2) Take the stripped carcass and break it into chunks. Put it into a deep 
pot, cover with water, and toss in 2 chopped carrots, 2 chopped onions (skins 
and all), a few celery leaves, a bay leaf, and some herbs. Add any leftover 
gravy from when you cooked the bird.</p> 
<p>3) Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Do not boil yet. Simmer just 
below the boiling point for at least 2 to 6 hours. Turn off the heat, skim the 
scum, remove the big chunks, set them aside, and strain. Taste it, but resist 
the temptation to add salt. You can always add it later, but you can't take it 
out. Thin it if you wish or cook it down to make it more concentrated. I like 
to concentrate it and freeze it in ice cube trays. Then I drop the cubes into a 
zipper bag and label it with the date. Then pick the boiled meat off the 
carcass and add it to the other leftover meat.</p> 
<p>4) The next time you are making rice, risotto, couscous, paella, or soup, 
use the frozen cubes for a wonderful flavor. Pour some in an ovenproof bowl, 
add somecaramelized onions, float a toasted crouton on it, put some muenster 
cheese on top, stick it under the broiler, and you've got a killer French onion 
soup.</p>

<h2>Pretty Bird Contest 2011</h2> 
<p>Thanksgiving 2011 was most profound for me. It came at the end of my second 
year of working full time on this website, and I had a lot to be thankful for. 
I made a respectable living cooking, eating, writing, and photographing my 
food. What a dream!</p> 
<p>On the big day I made the decision to stay by my computer until the last 
possible minute fielding questions like the Butterball Hotline. Your inquiries 
really helped me fine tune my recipe to anticipate future questions and as a 
result I have completely rewritten it. It was especially thrilling as the first 
pictures started rolling in. I felt like a proud Grandfather as his children 
sent in pictures of the grandkids. There were about 100 entries (I stopped 
counting) and more on my Facebook page. Selecting winners was not easy and took 
me a whole day. So many pretty birds!</p> 
<p><strong>First Prize by David Lauro.</strong> David's bird (above) was not 
only perfect looking, he took time to garnish it with lettuce and grapes, and 
frame it perfectly with his centerpiece in the background. This could be a 
magazine cover! He cooked 2 birds and submitted photos of several stages of the 
cooking process from brining to the heavily laden dining table, most of them 
out of focus. But he nailed this one and first prize in the process!</p> 
<p>From his comments: &quot;Here are pictures of the smoked turkeys I did for 
Thanksgiving 2011. I hope they are pretty enough, lol. I've cooked smoked 
turkey before in the past, but decided to follow your recipe in entering the 
contest, as well as seeing and tasting the end results. Your method produced a 
very moist and extremely flavorful bird. Your brine recipe is definitely a 
keeper! And so is your method for making your thin gravy. The herb rub added a 
lot to the flavor as well (just sage and thyme). My guests continually raved 
about how juicy and incredible the turkey tasted. They were big fans of the
Grilled Apple Salad too!&quot;</p> 
<p>He also said &quot;I wanted to add that these two birds were cooked in a 
Oklahoma Joe Longhorn smoker at around 260-275 degrees. It does render quite 
well at that temperature I've found, without it getting scorched on sides near 
the firebox. I used a mixture of soaked Guava and Apple wood chips that I would 
add to red-hot Kiawe coals at 1 hour intervals.&quot;</p> 
<p><em>First Prize.</em> Thermoworks ThermaPen. With this superfast precision 
digital thermometer, you'll never overcook anything again.</p> 
<p><strong>Second Prize by David Bradley.</strong> A perfectly carved bird (at 
with the thigh meat glowing pink from smoke and garnished with green onions, 
lemons, flat leaf parsley. His presentation is not overly formal or prissy, but 
achievable. He also submitted another picture of the dark mahogany bird 
roosting on hisWeber Kettle. I've cropped this slightly so you can see more of 
the bird.</p> 
<p>From his comments: &quot;This was my first time fixing the turkey. My dad 
always smoked the turkey when I was growing up and I wanted to do it too. With 
your method I'm pretty confident I improved on my Dad's. Just used a Weber 
classic - no Smokenator.&quot; That's right, he used an $89 grill. Dad would be 
proud David, and you know it is just going to get better over the years. You're 
setting a high bar for your kids.</p> 
<p><em>Second Prize.</em> Weber's Time to Grill by Jamie Purviance. Chef 
Purviance knows more about grilling than anybody. You'll drool over the pix.</p>
<p><strong>Third Prize (tie) by IndyDuq</strong> who did his Pretty Bird on a 
MAK pellet smoker. That's almost like cheating. I love the color of the bird 
and the platter and the place settings, devoid of people whom I can guess he 
had to shoo away for the shot. I vsualize them standing 5' away drooling, as am 
I as I write this.</p> 
<p>From his comments: &quot;Brined, smoked turkey. I've been smoking my birds 
for nearly 20 years, and brining for the last few. It was always an adventure 
chasing the temperature on my gas smoker depending on the fickle Midwestern 
weather this time of year. Thanks to Meatheads thorough reviews, I purchased a
MAK 1 Star this summer, and for the first time, my smoke was worry free thanks 
to the oven-like precision temperature control. Had a bit of a scare when the 
bird was done a full 90 minutes early, but dialed back the grill, and in spite 
of coming off at 175 deg, the meat was still very tender and juicy! So very 
nice to not be messing with the old gasser!! I should add that I had always 
been told that low &amp; slow was the ticket for turkey, and that is how I have 
always smoked my birds. Meathead explained that since there isn't an abundance 
of connective tissue in poultry, that you can cook at 325 deg. for a much 
shorter period of time. So nice to put the bird on at 9:30am this year as 
opposed to 5:30am for so many years!!&quot;</p> 
<p><em>Third Prize.</em> The Hamburger: A History by Josh Ozersky. Fun stuff 
to know about America's favorite iconic sandwich by one of my favorite food 
writers.</p> 
<p><strong>Third Prize (tie) by Jeff Boldt (right).</strong> Boldt submitted a 
lovely composition that was not quite in focus, but he wins a prize for his
creative video of the process posted on YouTube. His notes on the preparation: 
&quot;Last year I cooked my bird on my 22&quot; Weber kettle, this year I did 
it on my newly purchase rotisserie, can I add, this is my first cook with the 
roto. 13 LB Bird pre brined from Trader Joe's. Apples and Onions in the cavity. 
Smoked with Apple, Cherry and Maple wood.&quot; Boldt will also get a copy of
The Hamburger: A History by Josh Ozersky. </p> 
<p><strong>Honorable Mention by Kevin Keller (left). </strong>I love the way 
he presented the bird by reconstructing it although I am left wondering what he 
did with the thigh meat (I think there's a piece of it peaking out between the 
breasts so maybe it is underneath). Incidentally, this is similar to the way I 
try to present my turkey, but it rarely comes out looking so nice.</p> 
<p>He cooked his on a ceramic cooker that looks like a Big Green Egg judging 
by his other pix. I love the lighting, but I wish you had found a better place 
to put the bird so I didn't have to crop out the faucet...</p> 
<p>From his comments: &quot;Thank you for one of the best turkeys I've had for 
Thanksgiving. I've never cooked a turkey on a grill, so I supposed I violated 
one of your [tenets] above by doing it for the first time for the big day, but 
apart from a few other minor deviations I stuck to the plan and it came out 
moist and tasty. As instructed, I let the bird get up to 160 at the thickest 
part of the breast (multi-probe digital thermometer...one probe for the grill 
temp, one for the meat) and then pulled it out, set it in my cooler and let it 
work its way up to 165 and stay there for awhile stewing in its juices while I 
prepared the &quot;gravy,&quot; which was freaking amazing. My dogs both hate, 
and love you by the way...they were begging by the time I was done...the smell 
was driving them nuts.&quot;</p> 
<p><em>Honorable Mentions.</em> All HMs get the new AmazingRibs.com 
Temperature Guide Magnet. This 8.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; magnetic card can be 
attached to your fridge or grill, or both!</p> 
<p><strong>Honorable Mention by Smokin in Colorado (left).</strong> Let's hear 
it for focus! Smokin In Colorado submitted four nice sharp pix showing all 
sides of a perfect bird that practically glows. Alas there might have been more 
prizes if folks held their cameras a little steadier, used a higher ISO, or a 
tripod. From his comments: &quot;My first ever smoked turkey did not 
disappoint. Followed your recipe for the most part and it was the juiciest 
turkey any of us had ever had. Thanks for all your great insight on BBQ!&quot; 
Congrats. You can Tebow now.</p> 
<p><strong>Honorable Mention to Dean Shultis (right).</strong> Dean made a 
smart move with two small birds. He is clearly a man of good taste. &quot;My 
wife wanted me to smoke a turkey for Christmas day, so I decided to do two 10 
pound turkeys rather than one 20 pound turkey. I used a horizontal type smoker 
for about four hours and then transferred the turkeys to an indoor oven to 
finish them off. Following your advice, the turkeys were cooked to perfection! 
While is Positano Italy this summer we ordered a ceramic table which was to be 
cut from solid volcanic rock in a single slab and then decorated with hand 
painted ceramics. The table arrived just three days before Christmas. The 
plates are also hand made in the same area of Italy and hand painted, all a 
perfect compliment to the perfect turkeys.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Honorable Mention by B Tucker (left).</strong> Tucker submitted two 
shots, this facy fella ready to go out on the town dressed in spats, and 
another sitting on the beat up old Weber Genesis that has clearly served him 
well. &quot;I've tried many of your BBQ recipes with great success. This was my 
first time smoking a turkey. I was a little skeptical that it could be better 
than fried turkey, but this was by far the best turkey I've ever had! I 
followed your instructions step by step on my Weber gas grill and the result 
was out of this world. The pics I submitted below for the contest are actually 
a second, smaller turkey I smoked on Friday because there was no turkey left to 
eat with the rest of the leftovers from Thanksgiving Day!! I give Thanks to you 
for such a wonderful and informative site. You have made me my family's 'Grill 
Master'!!&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Honorable Mention by Scott D. Streaker (right).</strong> &quot;Hey 
Craig, here's our submission for the photo contest. The bird was excellent, 
only thing we goofed on was not having a big enough platter! Thanks for the 
excellent website, you taught me everything I know about BBQ.&quot; Platter? 
That looks like one serving! But it still shows a nice presentation of white 
meat and dark meat.</p> 
<h2>Pretty Bird Contest 2010</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>First Prize.</strong> Steve Navarre took great stills and made a 
fun 2 minute movie that shows the whole process of smoking a bird with a mix of 
video and stills.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Second Prize. </strong>Shawn Mullins sent in this beautiful 
presentation.</p>

<p>1) If you are looking for info, please use the table of contents or the

<p>2) Don't ask me any questions that involve temp or time unless you tell me 
that you are using a digital thermometer! Bi-metal dial thermometers are often 
off by as much as 50&deg;F! If you are not using a good digital you have no 
idea what the temp really is so I can't help you. If you are still using a dial 
thermometer, please read this article about thermometers, then buy a good 
digital, and then, if the problem persists (chances are it won't), hit me with 
your questions.Then, please tell me <em>everything</em> I need to know to 
answer your question. Like the type of cooker you are using. Remember, I am not

<h2>GrillGrates Take You To The Infrared Zone</h2> 
<p>GrillGrates are the best new product I have tested in years and the best 
thing to happen to beef since salt and pepper. The base superheats, eliminates 
hot spots, and blocks flareups. This is the concept behind the expensive new 
infrared grills. A must for gas grills.Click here for more about GrillGrates.
</p> <br>

<h2>The Smokenator: A Necessity For All Weber Kettles</h2> 
<p>If you have a Weber Kettle, you need the amazing Smokenator and Hovergrill. 
The Smokenator turns your grill into a first class smoker, and the Hovergrill 
can add capacity or be used to create steakhouse steaks.Click here to read more.
</p> 
<h2><strong>ThermoWorks Pocket Thermometer - No More Guessing</strong></h2> 
<p>A good thermometer is why I never serve overcooked or undercooked food. 
This one has a very thin tip with a tiny thermocouple so it gives an accurate 
reading in just six seconds. I cannot recommend it more highly. It will improve 
your cooking overnight and pay for itself in a hurry. And it is inexpensive.

<p>Steakhouse Knives</p> 
<p>These are the same knives used at the best steakhouses (Peter Luger, Smith 
&amp; Wollensky, Morton's and others). Machine washable, temper-ground,

edge retention, beefy hardwood handle, rust and stain resistant, and they stay 
shiny without polishing. And now they have the AmazingRibs.com imprimatur.Click
