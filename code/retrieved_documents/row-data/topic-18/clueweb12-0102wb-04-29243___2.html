<h1>Charcoal Stainless Steel Smokers</h1> <br>
<br>

<p>Charcoal stainless steel smokers can be a little more pricy than other 
models. One of the best benefits of stainless steel is its durability in the 
weather. If your smoker will frequently be exposed to rain, wind, sunlight and 
other elements, stainless steel may be the way to go. Many serious grilling 
enthusiasts refuse to use gas, and insist on charcoal grills or smokers.</p> 
<p>Though wood chips are commonly used in gas or propane grills and smokers to 
enhance the smoky flavor, charcoal stainless steel smokers can also benefit 
from this addition to flavor. Some types of wood work better with the different 
flavors of beef, pork, chicken or other foods. Consult recipes or experiment 
yourself to find which flavor combinations work best for you.</p> 
<p>Charcoal stainless steel smokers depend on a consistent temperature to 
produce the best results. Make sure the unit you buy has quality construction 
that will retain the heat properly and allow you to easily adjust dampers to 
raise or lower the temperature. Charcoal requires more babysitting than its 
electric and gas cousins, but many swear that the flavor they impart is more 
than worth the effort.</p> 
<p>When you get a new smoker, make sure to season it properly before the first 
use. Instructions can usually be found in the user&rsquo;s manual provided by 
the manufacturer. Seasoning the unit will enhance the flavor produced by the 
smoker and will help extend the life of the unit. Keep the unit covered when 
not in use. This will help extend the looks and lifespan of the unit.</p> <br>
