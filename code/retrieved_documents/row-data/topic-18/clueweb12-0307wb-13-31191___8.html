<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  The history of the Kamado Charcoal Grill is too long 
and confusing to recount. Suffice to say that when Dennis Linkletter stumbled 
across these ceramic charcoal wonders, he knew he could make them better. From 
a reinvention of airflow, spring assisted lid, and laser cut stainless steel 
parts this is one loaded grill. Anyone who knows anything about Kamado grills 
know that they grill at incredible temperatures and smoke at a perfect low and 
slow pace. This unit takes it to the next level and does it inside a shell of 
pure beauty. Manufacturer's Site <br>

<h3>Guide Review - Komodo Kamado OTB 23-inch Charcoal Grill</h3>  Since the 
1970s the Big Green Egg has been synonymous with the Kamado style of cooker. 
Many companies have tried to cash in on their popularity by imitating their 
design and business method. The Komodo Kamado isn't one of those. Probably the 
first thing you will notice about this charcoal grill/smoker is the price. This 
23-inch version will run you nearly 5 times what a comparable Egg would cost at 
around $3,600USD. Of course there is very little comparable between the two, 
other than the fact that they are both Kamado style grills.
<p>The Komodo Kamado is the epitome of over-engineering. Weighing in at nearly 
600 pounds of which 82 pounds are stainless steel, this is the space age of 
charcoal grills. That is more than just hyperbole. The bonding agent that holds 
the tiles on the shell is similar in composition to what NASA uses to hold heat 
tiles on the space shuttle. The cooking grates are 3/8-inch welded 304 
stainless rod and the remaining stainless steel pieces are CNC laser cut plate.
</p> 
<p>This Kamado style grill has a thick, heavy shell. The lid would literally 
be too heavy to lift but the covered spring mechanism makes the lid virtually 
weightless. The lid is held closed by a simple locking latch (that thumped my 
fingers a few times until I learned to move them out of the way). The top vent 
is actually a rotating cap made of the same refractory materials and covered in 
the same tiles as the rest of the grill. While the cap, once installed, won't 
fall off, it does wobble a little to allow for the expansion of the metal bolt 
that holds it in place.</p> 
<p>In the area of thinking of everything, the Komodo Kamado has the only 
rotisserie system (sold separately) that lets you close the lid completely 
while in use. There is even a space to install the popular BBQ Guru airflow 
control mechanism that lets you control the temperature of this grill with 
computer precision.</p> 
<p>This grill comes standard with three cooking grates, giving you up to 
nearly 1,000 square inches of potential cooking space. The bottom grate fits 
down inside the grill and has an open space in the front to feed the fire. The 
main grate has a hinged door in the front for the same purpose. The top grate 
sits on top of the main grate. These would be primarily used for smoking, 
giving you plenty of space for lots of barbecue.</p> 
<p>The Komodo Kamado is a luxury grill. Is it better than other similar 
grills? Yes. Is it 5 times better? No. You buy this grill because it is 
attractive, extremely well built, and because you can (I personally can't). It 
is available in virtually any color you want and in multiple tile patterns. 
There is even a brushed copper design coming soon.</p> 
<p>You buy this grill directly from the manufacturer and it is shipped to you 
in a big crate. Have several strong people on hand when it shows up. It is very 
heavy and if you are placing it on a wooden deck I suggest something to put 
under it so that it doesn't dent the wood. Special orders are available.</p>

<strong>The best 
do-it-all cooker</strong>, Member Greg_R 
<p>I've owned and used a Komodo Kamado (or KK) for the past 6 years for all 
kinds of food in every kind of weather imaginable. The KK is one of the few 
cookers that can cook slow-and-low (225 for BBQ) and also achieve very high 
temperatures for breads and pizza (800+ degrees). The cooker is extremely 
efficient, I have BBQ'd up to 20hrs straight without ever having to refill the 
charcoal. KK is also great if you have small children around... the insulation 
makes the surface slightly warm to the touch, even if you are running at very 
high temperatures. This insulation also makes cooking in wind, snow or rain 
very easy... the temperature barely fluctuates. There are similar cookers like 
the Big Green Egg, Kamado cooker (not to be confused with the KK), and other 
ceramic BBQs. These cookers range in quality from junk to decent with varying 
levels of customer support so buyer beware. The KK is a luxury item with the 
customization, fit &amp; finish and the customer support to match. You get to 
choose the color of the tiles or stones along with the grout so it can match 
other objects in your backyard. The cookers have increased in price and 
features over the years but this cooker still represents a good value when you 
consider the looks and required space for potential replacements. 5/5 stars.</p>
