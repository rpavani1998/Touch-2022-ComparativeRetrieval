<h2>Safaris in Southern Africa</h2> 
<p>Southern Africa is home to most of us in the company - the part of Africa 
that we know intimately.&nbsp; Here're some notes on planning a first time 
safari to southern Africa.</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Zambia</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Unquestionably Africa's best walking safari destination, remoter areas 
only accessible in the dry season May to October - nocturnal species are a very 
special attraction </li> 
<li> South Luangwa: home of the modern-day walking safari, one of the best 
places to see leopard, has some of the finest bushcamps and lodges in Africa 
</li> 
<li> North Luangwa: remote walking safari wilderness, practically off-limits 
for four decades, restricted access, &quot;serious safari turf&quot; </li> 
<li> Kafue: best reserve in Africa for antelope, ideal for old hands and 
&quot;birding&quot; enthusiasts </li> 
<li> Lower Zambezi: a relatively unexplored wilderness, Africa's real canoe 
safari spot with true wilderness lodges (canoeing tackled equally well from the 
Zimbabwean bank)</li> 
<li> Victoria Falls: from Livingstone - World Heritage Site, largest curtain 
of falling water on earth, Africa's &quot;adrenaline capital&quot; - one of the 
seven Natural Wonders - offers better &quot;adventure&quot; and 
&quot;cultural&quot; options than the Zimbabwean shoreline</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<br> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Botswana</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Best tackled on a fly-in or mobile basis - best from May to October </li> 
<li>Chobe: renowned for its elephant population, popular river front game 
viewing, zebra migrations in the Savuti and outstanding camps in the Selinda 
Reserve on the western front </li> 
<li>Okavango Delta: Africa's finest wetland - an oasis in the Kalahari, best 
accessed by light aircraft, usually explored from Moremi </li> 
<li>Moremi Game Reserve: focal point for Delta safaris, makes up nearly 70% of 
the Okavango Delta, includes some of Botswana's best camps - best on fly in 
safaris </li> 
<li>The Kalahari: home of the bushmen, one of the world's largest sand 
mantles, best tackled on a mobile safari, broadly encompasses the Makgadikgadi 
Pans</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Namibia</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Best tackled on a fly-in or mobile basis - best from May to October but 
fully accessible year round - allow lots of time if you can spare it </li> 
<li>Etosha: Namibia's premier wildlife spot, accessible only on the southern 
rim, has some particularly well known game viewing spots </li> 
<li>Central Namib: includes Namib-Naukluft, Sandwich Harbour and the famous 
sand dunes of Sossusvlei - a scenic photographers ideal </li> 
<li>Skeleton Coast: most of the area has limited access, best tackled on a 
fly-in safari in the north - very rugged, extraordinary wildlife </li> 
<li>Kaokoveld: Africa's last great wilderness, fascinating geology and ancient 
rock art - best tackled on a packaged safari</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Zimbabwe</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Victoria Falls: World Heritage Site, largest curtain of falling water on 
earth, Africa's &quot;adrenaline capital&quot; - one of the seven Natural 
Wonders - offers a wider range and selection of accommodation options than the 
Zambian shoreline </li> 
<li>Matusadona: on the shores of Lake Kariba, holds the highest concentration 
of wild lions, one of the last sanctuaries of the Black Rhino </li> 
<li>Mana Pools: World Heritage Site on the banks of the lower Zambezi River, 
best canoe safaris in Africa, ideal for walking </li> 
<li>Hwange: one of Africa's finest reserves, home to the Presidential herd of 
elephants</li> 
<li>Best tackled with a walking and canoeing safari - safaris year round but 
best May to October</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Safaris in East Africa</h2> 
<p> <b>Tanzania</b> and <b>Kenya</b> are East Africa's most popular wildlife 
destinations and you'll find a host of expensive to cheap &quot;safari 
packages&quot; and &quot;safari-beach combinations&quot;.&nbsp; The annual 
wildebeest migration is the big event.</p> 
<p> The trick to a planning a successful safari in East Africa invariably 
comes down to guiding standards and achieving a balance between affordability 
and &quot;crowd avoidance&quot;.</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Tanzania</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Tanzania's &quot;Northern Circuit&quot;: From Arusha, includes Tarangire, 
Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> South and Western Tanzania: From Arusha or Dar es Salaam, access into 
Selous, Ruaha or the western gems of Katavi and Mahale</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Katavi and Mahale: Katavi is renowned for its outstanding resident game 
and lack of crowds; Mahale is home to a healthy population of habituated 
chimps...but there's so much more</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Zanzibar: Stonetown and the eastern beaches are the obvious draw but if 
it's diving you want then go to Mafia</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> In Tanzania - this crowd avoidance formula works easily in southern 
Tanzania (particularly in Ruaha and Selous but better still in Katavi and 
Mahale between May and late October) during which time we also have some great 
beach combinations.</p> 
<h2>Safaris in Kenya</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li> The Masai Mara: From Nairobi, access into the Masai Mara Reserve and Mara 
Group Ranches - best from July to October</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Nairobi, Amboseli and the Rift Valley: From Nairobi, part of the 
traditional Kenyan safari circuit</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Lamu and the Kenyan Coast: Whilst Mombasa has provided the traditional 
coastal escape, Lamu tops it!</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>  Laikipia and the Northern Frontier District: Still wild and largely 
unpopulated this is really the region to explore if you've had a wildlife fix 
in the Mara</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> In Kenya - there's a huge amount of diversity in terms of wildlife, 
cultural options and beach breaks especially when combining the Mara with 
Laikipia, Amboseli and the north coast.&nbsp; Unless considering one or two 
very specific spots avoid Kenya in April, May and November.</p> 
<h2>  Safaris in Uganda</h2> <br>

<ul> 
<li>  Bwindi Impenetrable Forest: Arguably the best mountain gorilla trekking 
in Central Africa.&nbsp; Compare withRwanda</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>  Queen Elizabeth National Park: part of a much larger conservation area 
including the Ruwenzoris, Kibale, Virunga National Park and 
Kigezi/Chambura.&nbsp; Almost included as part of a more encompassing Uganda 
safari.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>  Kibale Forest National Park: Especially good for chimp trekking but 
renowned for some specialist guides whose penchant is for birds, orchids, 
butterflies and more.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>  Semliki Reserve: Excellent for birding, its wild nature and lack of 
crowds</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Destinations excluded from this part of our website....</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><b>South Africa</b> is an ideal destination for extensions particularly 
from Cape Town, something that we do regularly.&nbsp; We don't regard the 
Kruger National Park as a particularly good safari spot though - access is 
simple, it has a very well developed infrastructure and tends to attract big 
crowds....it's like a big safari park.&nbsp; The only real alternative are some 
of the smaller and more exclusive private concessions..$&nbsp; (South Africa 
lacks the wilder nature of destinations up north).</p></li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Kilimanjaro</b> is an area that we regularly combine with our Serengeti 
trips.&nbsp; We've partnered with specialists and offer both private and set 
date trips - 8000 climbs since 1993 with a 95% success rate....(speak to Mark 
or Jackie)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></li> 
<li> 
<p> <b>Central Africa</b>: Our &quot;emerging destinations&quot; include <b> 
Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville, CAR</b> and<b> Cameroon. </b> &nbsp;We've done 
expeditionary trips since 2005 - better suited to seasoned travellers and 
available as guided set-date trips each season (speak to John, Trish and Chris)
