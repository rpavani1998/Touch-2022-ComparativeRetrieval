<p><b>When Is The Best Time For Your African Photo Safari?</b></p>
<p>This is a question we are asked a lot. <b>We live in Africa, my wife is a 
local and we've been on over 80 African safaris</b>. Here's what we think. </p>
<p><b>Most countries in Africa are a year round destination. </b>This is 
especially true of Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania &amp; Botswana. In these 
countries, you can have a wonderful African safari or vacation anytime of year.
</p>
<p>We have taken safaris during all times of year &#150; low season, high 
season, shoulder season as well as peak season.<b>Of course in low season you 
will find far more deals</b> on Kenya safaris, South Africa safaris, Botswana 
safaris &amp; Tanzania safaris. </p>
