<p>Can&rsquo;t decide between the safari highlights of Kenya versus Tanzania? 
Don&rsquo;t: experience the best of both on this classic route that takes in 
five famous wildlife reserves in each legendary safari country. From Nairobi, 
visit Amboseli, the Lewa Conservancy and Masai Mara, then cross into Tanzania 
to follow the migrating herds across the Serengeti. Finish with the Ngorongoro 
Crater, home to the densest concentration of animals in all Africa.</p>

<h2>Our Expert Says</h2> 
<p>Wildlife, wildlife, wildlife! A chance to see the Big Five, witness amazing 
scenery and learn about fascinating cultures. What more could you ask for from 
a safari?</p>

<h2>Day 1: Nairobi</h2> 
<p>A rough outpost amidst a highland swamp when it became the colonial capital 
of British East Africa in 1907, Nairobi today is the urban heartbeat of an 
independent Kenya and one of Africa&rsquo;s most important cities. Nairobi has 
long been a meeting point for adventurers and travelers from all over the 
world, and most Kenya safaris still originate here. Nairobi&rsquo;s excellent 
museum and the historic home of Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa, are 
popular attractions.</p>  view image gallery 
<h2>Days 2-3: Amboseli/Chuylu Hills</h2> 
<p>Elephants abound in Amboseli, and to see these African icons against the 
backdrop of snow-topped Mount Kilimanjaro is a timeless image of the continent. 
This mosaic of dusty plains and swampy springs is also home to buffalo, 
wildebeest, zebra, impala, hyena, lion, leopard, cheetah and a third of 
Kenya&rsquo;s nearly 1,100 bird species. The nearby Chyulu Hills are 
exceptionally photogenic. These black lava remnants of extinct volcanoes are a 
captivating area of ancient craters, rolling grasslands and aromatic cedar 
forest.</p>  view image gallery 
<h2>Days 4-5: Lewa Wildlife Conservancy</h2> 
<p>Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is one of Africa&rsquo;s most impressive private 
conservation successes. Established as a rhino sanctuary, it has played a 
critical role in returning black rhinos from the brink of extinction while also 
supporting endangered white rhino, Grevy&rsquo;s zebra and sitatunga. 
Encompassing 65,000 acres, the conservancy protects 650 rhinos, 440 bird 
species and 70 species of mammals. Enjoy day and night safari drives and bush 
walks in view of snow-capped Mt. Kenya. Camel and horseback rides are also 
available.</p>  view image gallery 
<h2>Days 6-8: Masai Mara Nat'l Reserve</h2> 
<p>The famed Masai Mara is one of Africa&rsquo;s most acclaimed wildlife 
reserves, renowned for its annual wildebeest migration, prides of lion and huge 
herds of plains animals. The Mara is the northern portion of the Serengeti 
Plains, and we find excellent wildlife viewing all year long in these 
grasslands on the Tanzania border. The reserve is named for the Masai 
tribespeople, the traditional inhabitants of the area who graze cattle here, 
and the Mara River that runs through it.</p>  view image gallery 
<h2>Day 9: Arusha</h2> 
<p>Arusha is the safari capital of the world, the jumping-off point for the 
Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater and Kilimanjaro. In the shadow of Mount Meru, 
where verdant forest intersects with grassy savannah, Arusha sits within a lush 
agricultural region famed for its coffee and tea. Originally a German 
settlement, Arusha is today a lively city with an international flair. Arusha 
is noted for handcrafts, and the Cultural Heritage Center boasts an array of 
superb carvings, paintings, batiks and baskets.</p>  view image gallery 
<h2>Days 10-12: Serengeti Nat'l Park</h2> 
<p>The Serengeti is legendary. Here on Africa&rsquo;s Great Plains, where the 
sky arcs like a blue bowl over shimmering gold grasslands, the number of 
animals is staggering. Buffalo, elephant and giraffe roam the savannah. 
Leopards rest in acacia trees, pursuing prey with lion, cheetah, jackal and 
hyena. While the Serengeti is riveting year-round, nothing matches the 
phenomenon of the migration, when 1.5 million wildebeest and zebra traverse the 
plains with thousands of gazelle and predators in stealthy pursuit.</p>  view

<h2>Days 13-14: Ngorongoro Crater</h2> 
<p>Within the walls of the world&rsquo;s largest unbroken volcanic caldera is 
the densest concentration of wildlife in all of Africa. The crater floor, 12 
miles across, is a wonder of the natural world. More than 30,000 animals live 
in this primeval Eden, including huge herds of gazelle and the lions and hyena 
that prey upon them. Wildebeest, zebra, eland and giraffe are abundant, with 
leopard and cheetah in pursuit. The exceptionally fortunate may also spot the 
endangered black rhino.</p>  view image gallery
