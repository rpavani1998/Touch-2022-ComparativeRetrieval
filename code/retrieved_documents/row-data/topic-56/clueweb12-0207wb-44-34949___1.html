<br>
We will visit totally different areas from Arusha National

Park with great birds viewing area, surrounded by giant Baobab trees. Vast 
herds of antelopes, zebra and prides of lions share their home with hundreds of 
birds species including the famous pink wash of flamingos across Lake Manyara 
to Ngorongoro Crater and then to Serengeti plains full of herbivores and 
predators.<br>
<br>
<b>Focus: </b>Wildlife and Natural History.&nbsp;<br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>On this tour we concentrate on northern Tanzania, an area of superlatives 
and variety. We explore beautiful soda and freshwater lakes, the great 
grasslands of the Serengeti, and the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater. Covering 
such a range of habitats and altitude zones, we will encounter a great variety 
of mammals, and also birds, for conveniently the national parks harbour the 
best of African birdlife, from the giant Ostrich to tiny finches and colourful 
weavers.<br>
<br>
We begin our holiday in Arusha National Park, a microcosm of 
Tanzanian scenery. Spectacularly set between the huge volcanic peaks of 
snow-capped Kilimanjaro and rugged Mount Meru, the park is a verdant wilderness 
where monkey-filled rainforest encompasses the undisturbed Ngurdoto Crater and 
the beautiful Momella, Lakes that hold Hippos, waterbirds, and the reflection 
of Mount Kilimanjaro African Buffalo, Olive Baboon, Bushbuck, Warthog, Giraffe 
and Eastern Black-and-white Colobus Monkey may be seen; whilst, amongst an 
abundant birdlife, we will look out for African Pochard and Maccoa Ducks on the 
lakes, and White-eared and Brown-breasted Barbets in the woodland.<br>
<br>
We 
drive next to Tarangire National Park, where thousands of animals from the 
southern Masailands must come regularly in search of water from the Tarangire 
River. In the park&#146;s rolling bushland and savanna, punctuated with 
spectacular Baobab Trees, African Buffaloes, Eland, Oryx, Gerenuk, Impala, 
Elephants and Lesser Kudu may be found, together with such bird species as 
Crested Francolin, Yellow-collared Lovebird, Brown and Orange-bellied Parrots, 
Northern Pied Babbler and Magpie Shrike. Next we visit the legendary Ngorongoro 
Crater. Permanently watered, the crater&#146;s 225 square kilometres support a 
year-round residential population of thousands of mammals. Amongst great herds 
of Blue Wildebeest, African Buffalo and Burchell&#146;s Zebra, we will see 
Lions, Black-backed Jackals and Spotted Hyenas. Most notably, the crater is 
perhaps the best place in all of Africa to see the endangered Black Rhinoceros.
&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Birdwatching is excellent at Ngorongoro; the lakes and rivers attracting 
abundant wetland species, and the grasslands holding Ostriches, bustards, 
Secretary Birds, eagles and vultures.<br>
<br>
On the crater rim the lush 
montane forest holds an entirely different range of species which we may 
encounter around our lodge and on early morning and evening walks. Here we will 
also meet the people of the Masai tribe, proud, elegant and well attuned to 
their environment... and the commercial potential of incoming tourism!<br>
<br>

The Serengeti National Park&#146;s 14,673 square kilometres of acacia-dotted 
plains hold nearly two million Wildebeest and two thousand Lions; its selection 
of other mammals and birds is mouth-watering. We have five full days to sample 
the wealth of this great African wilderness.<br>
<br>
Leaving the Serengeti we 
will stop at the Olduvai Gorge &#151;&#147;Cradle of Mankind &#148;&#151; the 
famous archaeological site where Dr. Leakey discovered the 2-million-year-old 
remains of the Nutcracker Man, alongside those of prehistoric elephants and 
giant ostriches. Even today it is an area teeming with game.<br>
<br>
Lake 
Manyara is our last port of call. Its hotel and pool, beautifully perched on 
the wall of the Great Rift Valley, overlook the forest, plains, and 
flamingo-lined lake of the national park where we will search for its 
particularly large Elephants, tree-climbing Lions, and abundant birdlife.</p>

</b><b>Client Comments:</b><br>
<br>
&quot;A superb tour which 
fully lived up to expectations. I saw 470 bird species and mammal sightings 
included 16 cheetahs, 10 Black Rhino, Lions galore and 1m+ Wildebeests. Timing 
of the tour was perfect, coinciding with incredible numbers of animals in the 
Southern Serengeti. The guides were really excellent.&quot; D.Mike.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;This holiday was more than I expected and thoroughly enjoyed. I would 
recommend it to anyone who was visiting Africa for the first time and who 
wanted to meet such friendly people.&quot; J.Yankees.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Peter was 
a brilliant guide - and I have very high expectations! The driver guides are a 
real credit - they were excellent! Nothing was too much trouble. The whole trip 
was a wonderful experience! Thank you for enabling me to have the opportunity 
of sharing in it!&quot; Susie Miks.<br>
</p> <br>

<p>&quot;This is the 3rd successive trip we have taken with Mbango Safaris and 
each has been excellent in its own way. The holiday fulfilled our wish-list for 
birds so we were very happy with our choice. We really had an exceptional 
holiday and enjoyed wonderful scenery and bird life - I am sure we will be 
using Mbango Safaris again in the near future!&quot; Dibbie.<br>
<br>

&quot;Peter, as a guide was brilliant, as well as being very good 
company.&quot; Cornwall.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We had some truly amazing sightings 
and views of most wildlife and the whole experience was far beyond my 
expectations.&quot; S.R., Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We believe Peter 
Kamau is one of the best natural history tour guides we have met. His knowledge 
of wildlife was extensive and he helped everyone to spot as many different 
species as possible...We greatly enjoyed seeing such a wide variety of mammals 
and birds in Tanzania and we intend in due course to travel again with Mbango 
Safaris.&quot; J and J G., Devon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<br>

<p>&quot;Having Peter as tour guide was an asset, his knowledge of birds and 
wildlife made the holiday so enjoyable. He ensured that the entire group saw 
whatever had been spotted. His sense of humour made it all the better. We saw 
so many beautiful sightings. I had tears in my eyes seeing and hearing a mother 
Cheetah calling her young baby? eventually she went to find her baby and 
brought it to the kill. Magical. The driver guides were marvellous drivers and 
guides. We nick-named Peter Eagle-eyes, always with an eye open to tell us of a 
bird or animal that we could easily have missed as they are well camouflaged. 
My friend and I both say it was one of our best holidays for birds and animals. 
The group that we were with seemed to get on well together. It was a really 
memorable holiday: I would love to go again. I am sure that my friend and 
travelling companion S.J. sends her thanks and best wishes too.&quot; B.G., 
Wales<br>

<b>Grading: </b>This tour is a tented camps and lodge based 
Tanzania Wildlife safari. Please remember that, in the game parks of east 
Africa, it is generally not permitted for visitors to leave the safety of their 
vehicles, apart from in our lodge grounds, meaning that we&#146;ll spend quite 
a lot of time in the safari vehicles! It is, though, the only way to see 
Tanzania&#146;s unrivalled wildlife and every participant will enjoy a window 
seat.<br>
&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p></p>

fairly sunny, temperatures ranging from 20- 30oC, depending on altitude. 
Overcast weather, particularly in the afternoons, may not be infrequent, but 
rain is unlikely except on high ground such as Ngorongoro, where afternoon 
precipitation is a possibility. Here the weather can be chilly between sunset
