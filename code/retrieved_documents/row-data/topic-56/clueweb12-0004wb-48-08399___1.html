<h2>Some help with making your decisions</h2> 
<h3>For &quot;first-timers&quot;...</h3> 
<p>We recommend either East (Tanzania or Kenya) or Southern Africa (Zambia, 
Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Malawi) &#150; don&#146;t try combining the 
two regions in one trip.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>East Africa</b> has been the traditional choice for most, historically 
dominated by &#147;package tours&#148;. Best for safari and beach combinations 
&#150; very popular July to September and January/February.<br>
 &nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Southern Africa</b> offers significantly more choice and over the last 
20 years its safari industry has seen better development. Best for wildlife 
&#150; good at anytime of year.</li> </ul>

Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana and South Africa offer amongst the best safari 
habitats for birders. Absolute best is late October to mid December.</p>
