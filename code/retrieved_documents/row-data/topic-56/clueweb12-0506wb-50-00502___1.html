<p>Botswana &ndash; A Spectacular Paradise for Safari<br>
Botswana safaris 
offer adventure travelers extraordinary travel experiences in diverse and 
unspoiled natural environments. Botswana is considered the premier African 
safari destination and is certainly a place where every safari experience you 
have ever dreamed about can become reality. You can explore Botswana&rsquo;s 
varied habitats -- the desert, savannah, riparian forests and the wetlands of 
the Okavango Delta, including the game reserves of one of the wildest regions 
in Africa. The wide range of available activities includes safari game drives, 
scenic plane flights, walking with native tribesmen, skimming past wildlife in 
a dugout canoe (mokoro), motor boating along pristine rivers and channels, 
horseback riding or wading through the delta on the back of an elephant.</p> 
<p><b>Breathtaking Game Lands and Diverse Habitats</b><br>
 Botswana is known 
as one of the best safari sites in Africa in part because nearly 20 percent of 
its land is set aside for national parks and reserves. Geographically, Botswana 
is located just north of South Africa. It is approximately the size of Texas 
and the sands of the Kalahari Desert cover two-thirds of its area. The 
Kalahari, also known as Kgalagadi, is a sandy desert with sparse vegetation and 
a complex system of pans and riverbeds beneath the dunes, offering visitors an 
incredible wilderness experience.</p> 
<p>From the desert to the Delta, all of the immense ecosystems of Botswana are 
awe-inspiring. This pristine country boasts such world-renowned habitats as 
Chobe National Park, one of Africa's premier elephant refuges, and the Okavango 
Delta, a 200-kilometer-wide paradise, whose sparkling waters spread out over 
the expanse of the Kalahari sands.</p> 
<p>The Okavango Delta is Botswana&rsquo;s main safari attraction. Every March, 
rains from Angola to the north flood south down the Okavango River and into 
northern Botswana, creating the seasonal Okavango Delta -- the only inland 
delta of its size in the world with no outlet to the sea. The crystal clear 
waters move further into the desert each week, which means that in one visit, 
you can experience desert, savannah and flooded areas, all with different 
animal, bird and plant life populations.</p> 
<p>Mid-May to mid-September, when the water levels are neither too high nor 
too low, is one of the best times to visit in order to experience the 
Okavango&rsquo;s dynamic flood season. To gain the most from your Okavango 
Delta experience, it is recommended that you use the services of professional, 
experienced tour guides, who can take you through the myriad waterways and 
islands and lead you to the best game viewing, bird watching or fishing spots.
</p> 
<p>The world-renowned Moremi Game Reserve lies within the Okavango Delta and 
is a protected haven for wildlife and the Delta ecosystem. The wife of the late 
Batawana chief, Moremi III, created the Reserve in 1963 and it has been 
expanded to 5,000 square kilomteres. Several exclusive safari camps are located 
in Moremi.</p> 
<p>Chobe National Park, located in northeastern Botswana, is the 
country&rsquo;s second main tourist attraction. There is no development in this 
area; it remains a natural wilderness with varied game populations. Wildlife 
attractions include large herds of elephant and buffalo, plus healthy 
populations of hippo, lion, leopard, rhino, giraffe, eland, zebra, tsessebe, 
waterbuck, puku, red lechwe, crocodile, sable antelope, wild dog, warthog, 
baboons, impala, hyena, roan, kudu, and many others.</p> 
<p>Other national parks and game reserves in Botswana include the Central 
Kalahari Game Reserve, the Kalahari-Gemsbok Transfrontier Park, Khutse Game 
Reserve, Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, and Nxai Pan National Park.</p> 
<p><b>Accommodations to Suit Every Preference</b><br>
 Amid Botswana&rsquo;s 
elegant ecosystems and astounding beauty are accommodations that allow visitors 
to go on safari and still enjoy amenities such as bathrooms, beds and 
comfortable, spacious tents. Botswana is renowned for its refined and stylish 
safari accommodations, particularly in the heart of the Okavango Delta, Chobe 
National Park and Moremi Game Reserve.</p> 
<p>Safari accommodations range from rustic safari camps to permanently 
established luxury camps and lodges to chalets built from reeds or brick. 
Regardless of your personal preference, all accommodations in Botswana seek to 
achieve the perfect balance between comfort and ambiance without compromising 
the enjoyment of the natural bush.</p>
