<h2>Kenya Safari</h2> <br>
<br>

<p> A safari in Kenya is a magical experience and Kenya is the original safari 
destination; from the Maasai Mara to the top of Mt. Kenya this country offers a 
variety of terrain and safari wildlife. Odyssey Safaris local guides can 
organize safaris to any destination in Kenya. Please navigate to our<b>KENYA 
SAFARI</b> page to view our Kenya safari packages.</p> 
<h2>Kenya Tanzania Safari</h2> <br>
<br>

<p>Travelers to east Africa often take advantage of the amazing variety of 
safari destinations by planning a Kenya Tanzania safari. A tour operator is 
especially valuable when undertaking this type of safari and can help you 
organize all the details for a smooth and safe safari. Odyssey Safaris offers a 
number of trips that feature the highlights of a Kenya Tanzania Safari. Please 
navigate to our<b>KENYA AND TANZANIA SAFARI</b> page to view the safari 
packages.</p> 
<h2>Safaris Tanzania</h2> <br>
<br>

<p>A safaris Tanzania is similar to Kenya safari travel and is generally more 
expensive than travel in Kenya, however a safari in Tanzania takes you to some 
of the most exceptional parks and reserves found anywhere in the Africa. The 
Serengeti and Ngorongoro are world renown wildlife habitats and a common stop 
on safari tourist itineraries; the Selous and Ruaha National Reserves offer a 
safari experience that is a window to the Africa of decades past and Odyssey 
Safaris could help ou plan your Tanzania safari travel for the safari of a 
lifetime to any of the safari destinations in Tanzania. Oursafaris Tanzania are
