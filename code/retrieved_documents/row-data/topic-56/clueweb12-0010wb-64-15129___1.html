<p><b>Want to discover the best Kenya Tanzania safari for you?</b></p> <br>

<br> You've come to the right place! 
<p>Find peace of mind &amp; <b>answers to your questions about which are the 
best Kenya Tanzania safari for you.</b></p>

safaris, tours &amp; flights.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>After having been on more than 80 African safaris, I can tell you first 
hand &#150; Tanzania is simply dazzling.</b> </p>
<p>Home of world famous Serengeti, the annual wildebeest migration, and 
legendary Mount Kilimanjaro, this is a safari destination that can never 
disappoint.</p>
<p>The second thing I can tell you first hand is that combining it with a 
Kenya safari --<b>a Kenya Tanzania safari -- is an unparalleled African safari 
combination!</b></p>
<p>One thing&#146;s for sure, you will be amazed and left breathless. A  
Tanzania safari by itself or with Kenya as a Kenya Tanzania safari. Then ending 
it all off with a post safari beach holiday in exotic Lamu, Zanzibar (and even 
better in nearby Mozambique&#146;s Quirimbas (link Mozambique safari)) will 
leave you<b>revitalized, with a lasting sense of well being and peace.</b></p>
<p>If you are like many of our friends, looking for an exotic vacation that 
will get you close to nature and to your loved ones, then a Kenya Tanzania 
safari is just for you.</p>

with surrounding walls rising 609 meters above it, the crater is a natural 
sanctuary for over 25,000 animals, including the black rhino. It is also a 
conservation area inhabited by the Masai tribe.</p>
<p>The Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge is built onto the rim of this amazing 
natural phenomenon, a stunning plant and local creeper covered stone lodge 
where guests co-exist in perfect harmony with the surrounding natural 
environment and wildlife. Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge, close to some of the 
earliest dwellings of man in Olduvai Gorge, has taken their cave paintings as 
inspiration. It is built of stones and boulders and is literally hidden in the 
vegetation of the crater&#146;s rim, disappearing completely from view from the 
crater&#146;s floor.</p> <br>
<br>

Lodge is perched on the edge of the Mto Wa Mbu escarpment with one of the 
greatest views over the Great Rift Valley and its soda lake. It is difficult to 
imagine a more spectacular setting.</p>
<p>The lake is renowned among ornithologists for its birds of prey and the 
famous tree-climbing lions that inhabit the woodland that nestles between the 
lake and the Rift Valley.</p>
<p>The lodge glows with tranquility and peace. The design was inspired by the 
area&#146;s abundant bird life: swooping curves are complemented by soft, 
geometric patterns and stylish plaster moldings adorn the walls. Accommodation 
and public areas are housed in individual thatched circular buildings and are a 
tribute to local architectural traditions.</p> <br>
<br>
