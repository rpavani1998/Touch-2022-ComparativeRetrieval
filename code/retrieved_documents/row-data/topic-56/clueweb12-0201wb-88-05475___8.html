<br>

<p>Why Choose a Full Service Safari Travel Agency?</p> 
<p>Some travelers try to save money by booking with African based tour 
operators or travel agencies. However, travelers booking with agencies based 
outside of the United States cannot rely on strict national and local business 
regulations to protect their interests. Travelers who avoid agencies altogether 
and book directly with individual lodges and camps may indeed receive a 
discount, but those travelers must then make all the other arrangements a 
safari demands: airport pickup and transfer; travel between lodges and parks; 
arrangements with local pilots for flights in and out of the bush. And once all 
of those arrangements are made, should something go wrong, our discount 
traveler is left to solve his itinerary and logistical problems on his own. In 
Africa. With as much local knowledge as he carries with himself.</p> 
<p>Planning an African safari is difficult. A reliable and experienced travel 
agency such as Kenya.com can help travelers make smart choices early. And if 
something does wrong once the safari is underway, Kenya.com will get everything 
back on course while you continue to enjoy Africa.</p> 
<p>Why Choose Kenya.com?</p> 
<p>With a growing number of safari travel specialists to choose from, deciding 
on a reliable, experienced agency can be tough. Kenya.com has been operating 
since 1999, and is staffed by East African experienced travel professionals 
with firsthand knowledge of the people and places you will be visiting. We have 
arranged safaris for thousands of travelers. Many of our clients return to us 
again and again.</p> 
<p>We are also members of the Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO) and 
we are very proud to be corporate members and representatives of the East 
African Wildlife Society (EAWLS). Our service quality and performance conforms 
to exacting standards of excellence.</p> 
<p>If you still aren't sure that Kenya.com is the right choice, take a moment 
to review testimonials from a few of our clients,here.</p> 
<p>Ten Questions to Ask about a Safari Travel Agency</p> 
<p>Whether you book with Kenya.com or another travel agency, choose a firm 
that meets the following criteria.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Do the agents have firsthand knowledge? Confirm that the agency has 
extensive personal travel experience in Africa. We know Africa intimately. Each 
of our professional safari consultants has lived and worked in Africa. Managing 
director Ian Proctor has personally stayed at over 250 hotel/lodge/camp 
properties in east and southern Africa and inspected hundreds more. Our 
consultants spend six to eight weeks each year in Africa. We visit to insure 
that each property meets the high standards we demand for our clients, but also 
because we love Africa and its wild areas.</li> 
<li>Is the agency prompt and reliable? Are emails and phone messages replied 
to in a timely manner? Does the company offer a toll free telephone number? Our 
California office is open between 10 AM and 6 PM weekdays. We strive to be 
attentive to our clients' needs and focused on every detail of their safari 
plans.</li> 
<li>Can the agency plan all of your travel arrangements including 
accommodations, airline tickets and travel insurance? While our focus is safari 
travel planning, Kenya.com is a full service travel agency.</li> 
<li>Does the agency charge booking fees or fees for itinerary changes, which 
can be numerous as plans are refined and adjusted? Kenya.com does not require 
an upfront deposit and we do not charge any booking or change fees. We do 
charge US $30 per person per air ticket ticketing fee when issuing air tickets.
</li> 
<li>Does the agency accept credit cards for payment? Charge cards provide 
better consumer protection than payments made by check or wire transfer. They 
also make payments simple. Kenya.com accepts payment by American Express, 
Master Card and Visa.</li> 
<li>Is the agency USA based, licensed and registered? Only 14 states license 
or regulate travel agents, and of these states, there are currently only six 
that require registration. California is one of these six states. Kenya.com is 
licensed and registered in California.</li> 
<li>Is the agency a member of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), 
which is recognized as the leading symbol of travel professionalism and 
integrity? This is the affiliation most often endorsed by the media when 
recommending reliable travel agencies. All ASTA member agents must abide by a 
strict code of conduct. Kenya.com is a longstanding member of the Society.</li> 
<li>Is the staff friendly and engaging? Planning a trip to Africa is an 
exciting process, made even more so when you are working with a travel agent 
who is both friendly and passionate about what they do. We love Africa and we 
look forward helping others fall in love with Africa, too.</li> </ol> 
<p>Kenya.com Best Price Guarantee</p> 
<p>Finding the best safari price shouldn't be hard. It should be easy. That's 
why Kenya.com created the Best Safari Price Guarantee. Kenya.com will beat any 
safari price quote for the same &quot;Apples for Apples&quot; Kenya, Tanzania 
or Kenya/Tanzania combination safari from a reputable, well established US or 
Canada based safari provider. (Terms and Conditions)</p>
