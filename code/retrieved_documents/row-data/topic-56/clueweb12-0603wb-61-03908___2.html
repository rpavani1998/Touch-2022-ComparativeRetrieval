<h1>Safari Beach Holidays</h1>  What better way to perfectly compliment safari 
holidays in the African bush than finishing them off by relaxing on a white 
sandy beach with a sundowner? What makes Kenya and Tanzania so perfect for 
safari beach holidays is that it is so quick and easy to travel between the two.
<br> <br>
 These <b>Safari Beach Holidays</b> capture the highlights of 
Tanzania or Kenya before ending at a beach retreat, either on the beach in 
Kenya or on the tropical island of Zanzibar. Do safari holidays get better than 
this? We don&rsquo;t think so &ndash; but come and discover for yourself!<br>
