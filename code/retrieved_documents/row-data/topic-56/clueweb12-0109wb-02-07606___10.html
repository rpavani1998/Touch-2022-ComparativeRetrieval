&nbsp; <br>
Passports/Visa's <br>
<br>

<p>You must be in possession of a current passport that remains valid for at 
least six(6) months beyond your scheduled departure date from Tanzania. Most 
visitors do require visas with the exception of citizens of certain 
Commonwealth countries. Its is advisable to obtain them prior to your departure 
as several airlines insist on them prior to departure. They can also be 
obtained on arrival at the major International Airports and at the Namanga Gate 
on the Tanzania/Kenya border</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Customs <br>
<br>

<p>Personal effects, including cameras, binoculars, may be brought in free of 
duty. A custom's bond may be demanded from those bringing in Video, camcorders, 
radios, tape recorders, and musical instruments to ensure the goods are 
re-exported. Firearms and pocketknife require special permits. There is duty 
free allowances of 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars or 250 grammes of tobacco, and one 
pint of spirits. Visitors buying local handicrafts must keep their sales 
receipts for presentation to customs officials on departure.</p> <br>
&nbsp; 
<br> &nbsp; <br>
Currency <br>
<br>

<p>The unit of currency in Tanzania and Kenya is shilling, available in notes 
and coins. One shilling is divided into 100 cents. There are no restrictions on 
the amount of foreign currency that may be brought into Tanzania or Kenya, and 
no currency declaration is required. But import and export of Tanzanian and 
Kenyan currency is illegal. Foreign currency in Cash or Traveler's cheques may 
be exchanged at banks, authorized dealers and at the bureau de change at the 
international airports, major towns and border posts.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; <br>
Health and Immunization <br>
<br>

<p>Modern medical services are available in big cities and towns. However 
visitors are advised to bring their own medicines with them. Visitors from 
countries infected with cholera and yellow fever must produce international 
vaccination certificates. Anti-malaria medication is strongly recommended when 
traveling to East Africa. Anti-malaria tablets are recommended to be taken a 
few days prior to your arrival, during your stay and for a short period after 
returning home.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Insurance <br>
<br>

<p>We require that all clients arrange personal travel insurance to cover 
their medical, property, and other personal risks for the duration of their 
safaris.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Language <br>
<br>

<p>The official languages of Tanzania are Kiswahili and English, and in Kenya 
is English. Kiswahili is spoken and understood by the great majority of both 
two nationals. There is a wide usage of and understanding of English language, 
particularly, in the town centers. We have a team of fluent speaking English, 
French, and Germany. As the few number of those speaking other language other 
than English is concerned, we highly recommend to be notified at least two 
months prior to your safari.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Security <br>
<br>
<p>Tanzania and Kenya are the safest countries in East Africa. However, just 
as any other country, you have to be cautious of your surrounding. Avoid 
wearing expensive jewelry, walking in the dark, deserted lanes and streets. 
Keep an eye on your purses, wallets, handbags, and cameras. Never accept food 
or drinks from strangers.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Electricity <br>
<br>
<p>Tanzania and Kenya use the UK/European standard power supply of 220/240 
voltages. If you want to use U.S. appliances you will need a voltage converter 
as well as a plug converter. However, we do suggest to bring with you 
battery-operated appliances if possible.</p> <br>

generally recommended to drink only bottled water, which is readily available, 
everywhere. There are no restrictions on the sale and consumption of alcoholic 
drinks in East Africa. There are plenty of imported beers, wines and spirits in 
many places.</p> <br>

the norm. However in particularArusha and Nairobi , they experience colder 
weather in months of June and July. On safari, short sleeve shirts/blouses, and 
shorts are ideal. A light jacket/sweater may be needed in the evening at higher 
altitudes. Sensible walking shoes, a hat to keep off the sun, and sunglasses 
are essential too. but pack a sweater, it can be cold in the evening/morning. 
If climbing, needless to say, warm clothing is essential.</p> <br>

&nbsp; <br>
Photography <br>
<br>

<p>When one takes a picture of the people, they feel offended. So it is 
extremely important to ask them before doing so. You can get your driver to ask

batteries, several speeds of film and dust-proof bags.</p> <br>
