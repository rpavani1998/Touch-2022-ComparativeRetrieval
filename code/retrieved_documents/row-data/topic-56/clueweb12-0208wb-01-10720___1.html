<p>This is a lodge and luxury tented camps based safari, covering all aspects 
of general wildlife including watching both mammals and birds but with more 
emphasis on wildlife.</p> 
<p>We will visit totally different areas from Arusha National Park with 
it&#146;s unique wildlife and bird life as well to Tarangire National Park with 
great game viewing area, surrounded by yellow barked acacia&#146;s and the red 
clad Masai&#146;s people dotted across the plains. Vast herds of antelopes, 
zebra and prides of lions share their home with hundreds of bird&#146;s species 
including the famous pink wash of flamingos across Lake Manyara.<br>
<br>
<b>
Grading.</b>This tour is a tented camps and lodge based Tanzania wildlife 
safari. Please remember that, in the game parks of Tanzania, it is generally 
not permitted for visitors to leave the safety of their vehicles, apart from in 
our lodge grounds, meaning that we&#146;ll spend quite a lot of time in the 
comfortable 4x4 safari vehicles. It is, though, the only way to see 
Tanzania&#146;s unrivalled wildlife and every participant will enjoy a window 
seat.<br>
&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p><b>Day 1: Arusha. </b>Upon arrival in Arusha, you will be met by our 
airport representative and be transferred to Serena Mountain Village at the 
outskirts of Arusha. &nbsp;Mountain Village sits on a hilltop with lush gardens 
and breathtaking views of Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru. Tucked between the 
trees are fourteen cottages, built in traditional African styles and materials. 
The rest of the day will be spent relaxing after your long flight with plenty 
of time to explore the surrounding woodland and coffee plantations. Overnight at
<b>Serena Mountain Village</b>, bed and breakfast.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 2: Tarangire 
National Park.</b>After breakfast drive to Tarangire National Park. Tarangire 
covers 2,600 square kilometers of grassland, marshes and acacia scrub along the 
Tarangire River and is located around 75 milers southwest of Arusha. The park 
holds a year-round population of fringe-eared Oryx, Eland, Giraffe, Impala, 
buffalo, Gerenuk, lesser Kudu and greater herds of Elephant up to 300 strong. 
Indeed during the dry seasons when the animals crowd the shrink king waterholes 
Tangangire holds the greatest concentration of wildlife outside the Serengeti! 
With such a plethora of prey to choose from it is not surprising that the park 
is also one of the best areas in Northern Tanzania for predators including 
Lions, Leopards, the Elusive Wild Dogs and our first opportunity to look for 
the graceful cheetah. In much of Africa trees are the domain of the Leopard, 
but Tarangire and Manyara national Parks are one of the very few places where 
the lions are also fond of lazing on shaded bough, so keep your eyes up as well 
as down when looking for the king of cats</p> 
<p>Amongst the 550 species of birds that have been recorded here are Ostrich 
Secretary bird, Tawny and Martial Eagles bateleur, a variety of vultures, Kori 
Bustard (the worlds heaviest flying birds) the mighty Group Hornbill 
Yellow-collared lovebirds , Brown and Orange- bellied Parrots plus many species 
of kingfisher bee eater roller, hornbill, barbet, shrike weaver and finch. 
However perhaps the two striking and memorable species that punctuate the parks 
bush land are the spectacular Magpie Shrikes and the giant, bottle-shaped 
Baobab Trees. We will take lunch and settle at<b>Tarangire Sopa Lodge</b> 
before exploring the park on an early evening game drive.</p> 
<p><b>Day 3: Tarangire National Park. </b>A full day of Tarangire National 
Park. We will search for birds and mammals by taking morning and evening drives 
through the park. The heat of the day will be free for a siesta, or to enjoy 
the abundant and rather tame birdlife around our tented camp which may include 
pied wheatear, Slate-coloured Boubou, and Ashy Wattled and Superb Starlings.<b>
We will spend the second night at Tarangire Sopa Lodge.</b></p> 
<p><b>Day 4: Ngorongoro Crater. </b>We depart early this morning on our long 
drive across open Masai plains to the Ngorongoro crate. Passing by the northern 
end of Lake Manyara we ascend into the highlands to reach Ngorongoro stopping 
at view point across the rift valley.<br>
<br>
We will stop at Gibb&#146;s farm 
for lunch, a beautiful eco-friendly guest house situated between Lake Manyara 
and the Ngorongoro Crater, five kilometer from karatu the junction town of the 
crater highlands. This area is surrounded by extinct volcanoes and is an 
important farming area for the people. After lunch we will take a walk to a 
nearby waterfalls and visit the farm it self before continuing on into the 
Ngorongoro conservation area. The approaching the crater itself we climb up 
through liana covered hillsides and deep jungle-like vegetation. On reaching 
the top we will find one of the world&#146;s most amazing sights before us as 
we peer down at the crater floor dotted with animals, trees and lakes. We 
settle into the Ngorongoro Wildlife lodge which is to our base for the next 
three nights while we explore the crate in details. The lodge is ideally 
situated on the crater rim but at over 2,000 metres above the sea level, can be 
a bit chilly at night. Lunch, dinner and overnight at<b>Ngorongoro Serena Lodge
</b>. </p> 
<p><b>Day 5: Ngorongoro Crater. </b>Eight million years ago Ngorongoro was an 
active volcano. Its cone collapsed forming a massive caldera, covering 311 
square kilometers and creating one of the most scenic spectacles in all of 
Africa and the &#145;eighth wonder of the world&#146;. Over 600 meters deep and 
20 kilometers across, the caldera is covered by extensive grassland, patches of 
forest, marshes and lakes whilst attractive motane forest clings to the rim. 
Unlike other ecological systems in Africa, Ngorongoro is permanently watered 
and therefore able to support a resident population of animals. It is home to 
over 30,000 large mammals including White-bearded Wildebeest, African buffalo, 
Burchell&#146;s Zebra, grant&#146;s and Thompson&#146;s Gazelles, African 
Elephant, Black Rhinoceros, hippopotamus, Lion, spotted hyena and Black-backed 
Jackal. Indeed, Ngorongoro is one of the few places in Africa where the 
&#145;Big 5&#148; (Buffalo, elephant, Leopard, Lion and rhino) can be seen 
together. The birdlife is no less spectacular. An exciting range of water birds 
includes many species of ducks, geese, waders, storks and hundreds of thousands 
of flamingoes. Then there are the bustards, cranes, widowbirds, francolins and 
cisticolas to be found in the grassland and an equally diverse range of forest 
species!<br>
<br>
We will fully explore this wonderful area on morning and 
evening game drives, returning to our lodge for lunch. The Ngorongoro Crater is 
undoubtedly one of the very best areas for photography so make sure you bring 
plenty of film (or memory cards in this era). Lunch, dinner and overnight at<b>
Ngorongoro Serena Lodge</b>. </p> 
<p><b>Days 6 &#150; 9: Serengeti National Park. </b>Perhaps the greater 
wildlife spectacle in the world, the Serengeti belongs to the animals and no 
one else. Limitless grassy plains, scattered with rocky outcrops, acacia bush 
land and riverine forest, cover 14,673 square kilometers. The park contains 
nearly 40 species of large mammals, which in February, includes nearly two 
million white-bearded wildebeest, 200,000 Burchell&#146;s Zebra, 300,000 
Thompson&#146;s gazelles and an amazing 2,000 lions. Amongst a wealth of other 
species we hope to see are Impala, Grant&#146;s gazelle, Eland, giraffe, and 
warthog, Kirk&#146;s Dik-dik, Waterbuck, Topi and Hartebeest. This abundance of 
prey is pursued by many predator including Cheetahs, leopard, Serval Cats, 
Golden and Black-backed Jackals, spotted hyena and Bat-eared Foxes.<br>
<br>
We 
will undoubtedly see more of them, but exactly which ones will depend on our 
luck! In February, however, mammal viewing is at its best. This is the time of 
year that the vast herds of wildebeest move into the Serengeti from the Masai 
Mara to the north, in order to drop their calves and feed on the lush grass 
watered by the short rains of November and December. With the herds come the 
predators. There is of course, no guarantee that they will all be on your 
doorstep, but we will endeavor to follow them as far as possible &#150; for 
sheer mammalian spectacle, there is simply no better coincidence of time and 
place!</p> 
<p>Inevitably this feast of wildlife will eclipse the parks&#146; birdlife, 
but the latter cannot be ignored. Huge Ground Hornbills and elegant Secretary 
Birds stride across the grasslands along with Kori Bustards, grey Crowned Crane 
and smaller species such as Temminck&#146;s Coursers, Wattled Lapwing, 
Rosy-breasted Long claw, yellow-Shouldered widowbird and capped Wheatear. Lone 
bushes or dead trees provide lookout perches for a variety of bee-eaters and 
rollers, including the beautiful carmine bee-eater, whilst above them soar 
Martial Eagles, lappet-faced, African White-backed, hooded and Ruppell&#146;s 
Vultures, the latter four always on the look out for a recent kill. In the 
lodge grounds and acacia woodlands we should find a plethora of barbets, 
finches, weavers, Turacos, go-away-birds, glossy starlings and kingfishers. We 
will enjoy<b>four nights in the Serengeti Serena Lodge</b> in the heart of the 
reserve.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 10: Lake Manyara. </b>Making an early start, we will 
drive, via the Olduvai Gorge, back towards the crater highlands. The Olduvai 
Gorge &#147;Cradle of Mankind&#148; was brought to the attention of the world 
by Dr. Leakey. Here he discovered the 2-million-year-old remains of the 
&#147;nutcracker man&#148;, as well as those of prehistoric elephants and giant 
ostriches. We will have lunch back at the Ngorongoro Serena Lodge and retrace 
our steps through the crater highlands to Lake Manyara Serena. The hotel 
occupies a magnificent setting, perched a thousand feet above the park on the 
very edge of the Rift Valley wall, its views are stunning. Lunch at Ngorongoro 
Serena. Dinner &amp; overnight at<b>Lake Manyara Serena Lodge</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>
Day 11: Arusha.</b>We will spend the day exploring Lake Manyara National Park 
which is made up of a wide variety of habitats. Lush forest of towering Fig and 
Mahogany trees, open grassy plains, acacia woodland and Cliffside scrub all 
attract a great variety of birds and animals. But, it is the huge soda lake 
&#150; Tanzania&#146;s Nakuru &#150; that is the greatest attraction. Here, 
hundreds of thousands of Greater and Lesser Flamingoes present a carpet of 
shimmering pink that stretches into the distant heat haze, whilst yellow-billed 
and Marabou storks, African spoonbills, herons, egrets, ducks and waders 
decorate the shoreline. As mentioned earlier, Manyara is also famous for its 
unique tree-climbing lions. These can be hard to see, but other game is 
plentiful in the form of African Elephant, White-bearded Wildebeest, 
Burchell&#146;s Zebra, Thompson&#146;s Gazelle, Impala, olive Baboon, Blue and 
Vervet Monkeys, Kirk&#146;s Dik-dik, warthog, Hippopotamus, Giraffe, waterbuck 
and Black-backed Jackal. Packed lunch at Lake Manyara. Overnight at<b>Serena 
Mountain Village Lodge</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 12: </b>After breakfast you will 
drive to the airport for our outbound flight back home.<br>
<br>
</p> <br>

<p><b>Weather. </b>During our tour we can expect most days to be dry and 
fairly sunny, temperatures ranging from 20- 30 C, depending on altitude. 
Overcast weather, particularly in the afternoons, may not be infrequent, but 
rain is unlikely except on high ground such as Ngorongoro, where afternoon 
precipitation is a possibility. Here the weather can be chilly between sunset 
and sunrise.<br>
<br>
<b>Entry requirements. </b>All European countries 
passport holders and most other nationalities require a visa for Tanzania which 
is obtained in advance from the nearest embassy. You will also need to have 
various vaccinations and take malaria prophylactic. Please consult the nearest
