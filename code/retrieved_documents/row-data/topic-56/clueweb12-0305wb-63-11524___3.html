<ul> 
<li> Kenya has been one of Africa's most popular destinations for both first 
timers and experienced safari goers alike.&nbsp; The safari industry is mature 
so despite a dent in the aftermath of the 2007 elections Kenya is once again 
very much a top safari spot!&nbsp; If you're looking for an insider's insight 
then just contact us....</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>The main attractions are prolific game, warm welcoming people operating a 
selection of small and personalised camps and lodges...with amazing weather to 
boot. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> To get the most out of Kenya it's best to combine two or more of the 
national parks and reserves for a true sense of the contrasting terrain and 
habitats. A popular option is to round off a safari with a break on the coast.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>The Masai Mara is one of Kenya&#146;s most visited national reserves, 
famous for its vast, open plains and the annual migration which is typically 
present between July and October.  *see simplified notes on the migration, the 
&quot;real story&quot; about the migration, how to plan a migration safari</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Other favoured spots are Amboseli for elephants, Laikipia and the Northern 
Frontier District for wilderness and adventure. Samburu and Tsavo tend to be 
popular but busy, whilst other lesser known areas include Meru and Shaba. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Kenya&#146;s lakes each have their own distinctive highlights including 
the flamingos of Nakuru, steam jets at Bogoria and the fishing and water sports 
on Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile.&nbsp; If you're an adventurer then 
take a closer look at Lake Turkana.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>In our view, Tanzania is less mainstream and offers a far better wildlife 
experience but Kenya offers greater diversity, better cultural exchanges and 
generally has a more sophisticated safari industry.&nbsp;Contact us to talk 
through the options. </li> </ul>
