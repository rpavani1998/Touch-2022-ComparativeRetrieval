Unwind on holiday to exotic Zanzibar <br>
<br>

Zanzibar is an archipelago made up of Zanzibar and Pemba Islands, and several 
islets.<strong>Zanzibar Island</strong> (known locally as Unguja, but as 
Zanzibar internationally) is still one of the best-kept secrets in the Indian 
Ocean, characterized by beautiful sandy beaches with fringing coral reefs, also 
featuring fascinating historical<strong>Stone Town</strong> (<em>A World 
Heritage Site</em>), lush plantation, incredible history and fascinating 
culture. A special type of<strong>African safari adventure</strong> awaits you 
in<strong>Zanzibar</strong> (see Zanzibar map). We offer a wide range of 
<strong>packages in Zanzibar</strong>. &nbsp;Click here for our <strong>Special 
Offer,</strong>14 days Safari and Zanzibar!<br>
<br>
 As this is an island 
destination, a wide range of watersports can be pre-booked, and tours around 
the island, (e.g. spice tours, cultural tours, historical tours, et cetera)<br>

<br> For alternative remote beach locations, either instead of, or in 
combination with Zanzibar please see<strong>Mafia</strong> and <strong>Pemba
</strong> islands. <br>

Soar atop Mount Kilimanjaro <br>
<br>
Mystic 
Mount Kilimanjaro continues to enthrall its viewers, being the highest mountain 
in Africa and one of the largest &lsquo;free standing&rsquo; mountains in the 
world. Images of the towering snow-covered cone rising majestically from 
fertile green foothills have become a powerful motif of Tanzania's 
extraordinary extremes. A distinct sense of awe strikes one when the clouds 
clear to reveal a glimpse of the towering snow-capped peaks, shining bright in 
the equatorial sun.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mount Kilimanjaro</strong> is inimitable 
in that during the ascent you will climb through all climatalogical zones. 
Commencing with tropical rain forest, through moss, and desert, to the 
snow-capped summit. One can access the summit through different routes that 
vary in difficulty &ndash;<strong>Marangu</strong>, <strong>Machame</strong>, 
<strong>Lemosho</strong>, <strong>Umbwe</strong>, and <strong>Rongai</strong>.
<br> <br>
 Climbing Kilimanjaro is a must-do challenge for about every trekker 
and mountaineer in the world. <br>
