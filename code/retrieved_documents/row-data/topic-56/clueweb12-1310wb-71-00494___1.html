<p><strong>Getting around</strong><br>
Border Points<br>
Just below the 
equator, Tanzania borders Kenya and Uganda in the north; Zaire, Rwanda and 
Burundi in the west; and Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique in the south. Namanga 
Gate (between Tanzania and Kenya) is open 24 hours per day.<br>
<br>
If you 
carry firearms you will require a special permit. The duty-free allowance is 
limited to one litre of liquor; 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars or 250g of tobacco; 
and 250ml of perfume. Any other items are subject to customs duty.<br>
&nbsp;
<br><strong>Rail Travel </strong></p> 
<p>Tanzania has two rail lines: The Tazara line runs from Dar es Salaam to 
Zambia's New Kapiri Mposhi, via Mbeya and Tunduma. The central line runs from 
Dar es Salaam to Kigoma and Mwanza, via Morogoro, Dodoma and Tabora.<br>
<br>

Rail is a safer but slower travel option, and food can be purchased on board. 
Crime is not a major problem, but do ensure you have your possessions with you 
at all times.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Bus Travel</strong></p> 
<p>'Express' and 'ordinary' buses operate along Tanzania's major long-distance 
routes.<br>
<br>
Express buses are more comfortable, make fewer stops, and 
operate to a schedule, though they are slightly more expensive.<br>
<br>

Ordinary buses (generally the only option on secondary routes) are often packed 
to overflowing, make many stops, and deviate quite freely from the schedule. 
They and dalla-dallas (minivans) serve shorter routes. The latter are a slower 
and more dangerous option.<br>
<br>
Buses are not permitted to operate at 
night. Note that Tanzanian roads have a high accident rates, and buses tend to 
speed. Reservations are not always possible, so get to the bus with plenty of 
time before the scheduled departure. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Airports </strong></p> 
<p>Domestic air services operate between the major airports:<br>
&raquo; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dar es Salaam International (DAR)<br>
&raquo; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Kilimanjaro International (JRO)<br>
&raquo; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Kishni, 
Zanzibar (ZNZ)<br>
There are a total of 129 airports in Tanzania, of which only 
eleven are paved. Air services have become the most significant form of 
internal transport for official and business travel. Small planes, from charter 
companies, fly to towns and to bush airstrips.</p> 
<p><strong>Roads&nbsp; </strong><br>
<br>
There are 88,200 km of highways in 
Tanzania, but only 3,704 km of these are tarred. The key roads are in good 
condition, though the majority are bad and hazardous.<br>
<br>
Road conditions 
in the reserves and national parks of Tanzania are extremely rough. During the 
rainy season, many roads are passable only with four-wheel drive vehicles. 
Tanzania is definitely not recommended as a self-drive destination. Any 
four-wheel drive vehicles for safaris usually have to be hired with a driver.
<br><br>
Watch out for cyclists, pedestrians, livestock and wild animals. Most 
car rental companies do not allow self-drive outside of Dar es Salaam. Driving 
is on the left side of the road. Your home driving licence, with English 
translation if necessary, is accepted.<br>
<br>
Passports and Visas<strong><br>

</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Entry requirements </strong></p> 
<p><br>
(as at Dec 2004)<br>
Important Note: This is a guide only - please 
check with your nearest Tanzanian Consulate for up to date information.<br>
<br>
Almost all nationalities of visitor require visas, with the exception of 
certain countries of the Commonwealth. You should acquire a visa before 
travelling, because some airlines insist on them prior to departure. Depending 
on nationality and country of origin, a visa may be obtained on arrival at Dar 
es Salaam and Kilimanjaro airports and at Namanga Gate on the Tanzania/Kenya 
border.<br>
<br>
Despite being part of the union of Tanzania, Zanzibar remains 
independent. Passports and a Tanzanian visa are required for even a single 
day's visit. Requirements may change so you are advised to contact your nearest 
Tanzanian Consulate before finalising your travel arrangements.<br>
<br>
Visas 
cost US$10-60 depending on nationality and are usually valid for three months. 
Requirements for obtaining a visa are: a passport valid for six months beyond 
the intended length of stay, two passport photographs, proof of sufficient 
funds, two application forms and a detailed itinerary stating the reason for 
your visit. Sometimes a photocopy of your airline tickets is required.<br>

<strong><br>
&nbsp;General Accommodation Info</strong><br>
Most safari lodges 
vary in size and style, and are built to blend in with the environment. 
Accommodation tends to be of rondawel or banda type, with a lounge, central 
dining area and bar in single unit hotels.<br>
<br>
Do not be misled by the 
term &quot;tented accommodation&quot; - this usually refers to luxurious 
insect-proof tents that are permanently pitched on concrete bases, often 
including en suite bathrooms with flush toilets. They are very popular and give 
the visitor the true experience of being close to nature without the 
inconvenience and discomfort that can be associated with camping in the open.
<br><br>
All major towns in Tanzania have excellent luxury hotels, and all 
towns will at least have a good guest house. Note that the word hotel (or in 
Swahili, hoteli) means food and drink only, rather than lodging. It would be 
better to use the word guesthouse (or in Swahili, guesti). Hotels often have 
their own restaurants. The main meal is at midday and many restaurants are 
closed in the evening. Local food is readily available. In the east, facing the 
rich Indian ocean, you will encounter wonderful seafood as well as great 
tasting fruit.<br>
<br>
National parks offer &quot;ordinary&quot; campsites 
which provide toilets, fireplaces and usually water taps. &quot;Special&quot; 
campsites usually only have a pit toilet. It is necessary to pre-book special 
campsites, and advisable to book ordinary ones. Camping is limited outside the 
national parks.<br>
<br>
Due to the distances travelled in Tanzania it is 
strongly recommended that you make all your arrangements in advance. During the 
migration and peak season, availability is at a premium.</p>
