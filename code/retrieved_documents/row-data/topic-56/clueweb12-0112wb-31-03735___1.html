<h1>Choose Your African Safari</h1> 
<p>Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda are the best places in the world to see 
wildlife and birds in their natural abundance.</p> 
<p>Plan your Kenya safari, Tanzania safari, Uganda safari and Rwanda safari or 
a day tour from Mombasa and Nairobi to the most attractive and exciting areas 
in East Africa. While visiting national parks like Serengeti, Ngorongoro 
Crater, Masai Mara, Amboseli, Samburu, Lake Nakuru, Tsavo, Salt Lick, and Lake 
Victoria in search of animals and wildlife encounter African people and their 
African culture. The Big Five of Africa, elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard, and 
rhino as well as the great Wildebeest Migration, gorillas, African birds, 
crocodile and hippopotamus at the backdrop of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Kenya, the 
African savannah, the Great African Rift Valley and the lakes will be forever 
in your memory as the big African safari dream.</p> <br>
