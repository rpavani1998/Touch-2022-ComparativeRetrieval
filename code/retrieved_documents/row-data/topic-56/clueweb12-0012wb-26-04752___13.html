 Kenya Flying Safaris <br>

<p></p> 
<p>A <strong>Kenya</strong><strong> flying safari</strong>, commonly known as 
<strong>air safaris in Kenya</strong> are a fantastic alternative if you&rsquo; 
have a short travel time or want to<strong>tour Kenya</strong> in the easiest 
way, using light aircrafts to make travel easy. There's a network of airstrips 
across in Kenya so most national parks and lodge accommodation can be reached. 
Spend two or three nights in each location - a superb way to take in the 
region's wildlife, in style. A<strong>flying safari</strong> <strong>in Kenya
</strong> will often center on one or two areas, flying by light aircraft 
between holiday destinations to make the most of your time. After an early 
start each day, spend a few hours on a safari game drive in the local area 
viewing the wildlife. Return to your safari lodge for some well earned 
relaxation, followed by a second game drive later in the day.<br>

<p>There's an excellent range of accommodation available in the main locations 
throughout Kenya, from hotel-style lodges to small, exclusive retreats, mobile 
camps, permanent safari camp, lodge safaris.<strong>Kenya</strong><strong> 
Flying safaris</strong> offer more flexibility than road safaris, so if you 
don't see the lodge or camp you're after here, just ask! Any safari can be 
extended to the beaches of<strong>Mombassa,</strong> or <strong>Zanzibar
</strong>, <strong>Malindi, Lamu Island.</strong>&nbsp; Our Kenya flying 
safaris start with a flight from London to Nairobi, with regional connections 
in the UK also possible. At the end of your safari, it's a short flight to 
Mombassa, or onwards to Zanzibar or the Indian Ocean islands - or back to the 
UK!</p> <br>

<p><strong>Flying Safaris</strong> <strong>in Kenya Uganda Tanzania</strong> 
involves flying by light aircraft to various safari lodges, exploring different 
regions of a country or countries. This is truly one of the best ways to go on 
a Africa safari. Your safari literally begins when you take off, as your light 
aircraft will usually fly at a low altitude enabling you to gaze over the vast 
plains of East African Wilderness with the possibility of sighting an array of 
wild animals. A typical Flying Safari in Kenya involves spending a night or two 
in each camp, lodge, hotel or beach resort before flying to the next<strong>
vacation</strong> destination. As different regions in East Africa tend to be 
diverse, this type of safaris allows the traveller to have a more complete 
experience of the country&rsquo;s wildlife areas.<br>
<strong>Air safaris
</strong> allow you more flexibility to experience different holiday 
destinations over a short period of time and the &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s eye 
view&rdquo; from the plane as you gaze over Africa&rsquo;s magnificent scenery 
can be simply stunning, making the flying safari the<strong>ultimate African 
Safari option</strong>.<br>
 Flying safaris are becoming increasingly popular 
in Africa, with daily scheduled flights direct from Nairobi Mombasa Malindi 
Arusha and Kampala International Airport onto the bush strips of the private 
lodges. In East Africa, air transfer by light aircraft is also widely used for 
travel between the main wildlife regions of<strong>Masai Mara, Serengeti and 
Ngorongoro Crater.</strong>The most widely used aircraft on charter runs are 
the Cessna 206, 210 and the 208 Caravan, but twin engined Kingairs or 
Islanders, as well as a variety of small jets, are all available to travellers 
prepared to pay more for the experience or added speed.<br>
 All Aircrafts in 
<strong>Kenya Tanzania Uganda and Zanzibar Island</strong> adhere to stringent 
safety regulations and servicing, while the &quot;bush pilots&quot; are some of 
the most skilled aviators in the world.&nbsp; African Safaris and Adventures is 
an expert safari company and tour operator works with a number of air charter 
operators, including<strong>Air Kenya, Mombassa Air, Kenya Airways, Prestige 
Airlines, Safari Link</strong><br>
 Step aboard your own&nbsp;<strong>personal 
aircraft</strong> at your first point of arrival in Africa, be it <strong>
Nairobi</strong><strong>, Dar es Salaam</strong> or any other centre in East 
Africa, and enjoy a fantastic&nbsp;<strong>Fly-in Safari</strong>.&nbsp;From 
this moment on we'll take care of you and all your travel arrangements. The 
Aircraft and the pilot will remain with you throughout the safari, taking you 
from lodge to lodge at your convenience.&nbsp;<br>
 You will travel in 
twin-engine comfort avoiding detours, check-in times, and luggage loss!&nbsp; 
We will take you straight to the bush airfield closest to your holiday 
destination. And en-route, we will shield you from travel strain by taking care 
of the border formalities, transfers, documentation, and sundry travel 
irritations for you. At your destination, you are ensured optimal room 
allocation, guiding and activities...<br>
<strong>Advantages of going on a Air 
Safari In East Africa:</strong> <br>
 Get to your lodge &amp; safaris quicker, 
safer and&nbsp;have a better view on the way&nbsp;while spending more quality 
time when you get there... Replace repetitive<strong>bush travel </strong>with 
more stunning and panoramic views!<br>
 With an air safari in Africa you can 
see more, from a different perspective and never feel rushed. Be it the<strong>
Tanzanian safari, Uganda Gorilla Tracking Safari, Laikipia Mobile Safari, Mt 
Kenya Climbing.</strong><br>
 A flying safari is the best way to get immersed 
in the sheer vastness and grandeur of this continent.<br>
 You have a choice of 
going on one of our<strong>package flying Safaris</strong> where we make use of 
scheduled local flights to fly you into a region and onto a lodge! Or allow us 
to tailor-make a private charter plane to fly you from one lodge to the next. 
Below you will find numerous flying safaris that Africa Safaris and Adventures 
runs throughout East Africa. You can join one of our<strong>scheduled flying 
safaris</strong> or if you'd like, one of our experienced travel consultants 
can tailor-make a private charter flying safari to meet your departure date, 
time period, group size and budget.<br>
<strong>Kenya</strong><strong> private 
Air Charters&nbsp;</strong><br>
 There are schedule flying services to most of 
the destinations in Kenya, and we can arrange these, however there are many 
other safari destinations that are only accessible by private charter. Often 
with a large group of people coming to Kenya on<strong>Safari</strong>, it may 
be cheaper and logistically easier to charter a<strong>private aircraft</strong>
. It is certainly very much more fun.<br>
 From the air you can see all the 
Lakes of the rift valley, from<strong>Lake Turkana</strong> in the North to the 
flamingoes, the mountains, the hills and the grasslands teeming with game, 
quite simply the grandness of nature.<strong>Guided Flying Safaris </strong>
provide a unique and personal experience. Our clients can fly at a moments 
notice or linger longer if a few more hours are needed not to rush breakfast. A 
luxury that means one is not restricted by scheduled times of arrivals and 
departures. With bush strips dotted all over the country, flying is very much a 
part of life in Kenya. The sense of freedom that it gives is unparalleled.<br>
 
This is not to say that that our safaris are restricted to flying only. Indeed 
some people with more time to travel prefer to see the country by road and we 
can also arrange this using 4x4 Safari vehicles.<br>
