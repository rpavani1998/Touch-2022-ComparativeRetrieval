<p>This is a luxury tented camps based safari, covering all aspects of general 
wildlife including watching both mammals and birds but with more emphasis on 
wildlife.<br>
<br>
We will visit totally different areas from the expansive 
Tsavo National Park with it&#146;s unique wildlife and bird life as well to the 
famous Masai Mara Game Reserve with great game viewing area, surrounded by 
yellow barked acacia&#146;s and the red clad Masai&#146;s people dotted across 
the plains, vast herds of antelopes, zebras share their home with prides of 
lions to Lake Nakuru National Park with hundreds of birds species including the 
famous pink wash of flamingos.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 1: Nairobi. </b>Upon arrival in 
Nairobi you will be meet by our airport representative and be transferred to 
Norfolk hotel at the outskirts of the city. Overnight at<b>Norfolk Hotel</b>, 
bed and breakfast.</p> <br>

<p><b><br>
Day 2 &amp; 3 Tsavo West National Park. </b>This morning we will 
make the long drive to Tsavo West National Park, arriving around lunch time. We 
will then check into the luxurious Finch Hattons Camp, our base for the next 
2-nights of the tour.<br>
<br>
Tsavo West, when combined with Tsavo East, 
covers over 20,000 square kilometers creating one of Africa's largest 
conservation areas. This is a classic East African park watched over by the 
distant snow-capped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. Tsavo is a place of wide 
horizons and undulating acacia covered red earth plains dotted with graceful 
parties of Giraffes and herds of Elephant and Zebra. It is cut by only two 
permanent rivers and so has a more arid feel to it than the other reserves we 
will be visiting on the holiday, but is nevertheless a wonderful area for 
mammals, birds and other wildlife.<br>
<br>
Tsavo is also home to the Ngulia 
Rhino Sanctuary. The decline of the Eastern Black Rhinoceros has been both 
rapid and shocking and, not too long ago, there was a real fear that this 
amazing animal may become extinct. For example, in the 1970s the Tsavo 
ecosystem alone supported an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Rhino, but by 1989 
poaching had reduced this to a mere 20 individuals! Today, an estimated 540 
Eastern Black Rhinoceros remain in the world and 85% of these are to be found 
in Kenya.<br>
<br>
The Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary has played an important role in 
the advancement of this work and helped develop many of the monitoring and 
conservation methods now employed in other parts of the country. The sanctuary 
itself was established in 1985 and protected 3 Rhino in an area of less than 1 
square mile. Today Ngulia Sanctuary covers 38 square miles (62 square 
kilometres) and is home to 57 Rhino, more than half of which were born there. 
This has been a fantastic success story and Rhino numbers continue to grow. 
During our stay in Tsavo we will visit the Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary to try and 
find, one or two of the Rhino that live here, as well as a host of colourful 
birds such as Lilac-breasted Roller, Superb Starling and Beautiful Sunbird.<br>

&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>We will also head out on game drives into Tsavo West National Park itself 
to enjoy the wealth of mammals, birds and other wildlife that abounds here. 
Tsavo is home to Kenya's 'red' Elephants and herds of these red-earth dusted 
giants are a familiar sight, along with Impala, Thompson's Gazelle, Masai 
Giraffe, Buffalo and perhaps even our first Lion or Cheetah. Indeed, the Lions 
of Tsavo are descendants of the legendary man-eaters (the Ghost and the 
Darkness) who brought the building of the Nairobi to Mombasa rail road to a 
standstill at the beginning of the last century. Friendlier inhabitants, 
however, include a wealth of birdlife - an amazing 600 species have been 
recorded here - including Ostrich, Kori Bustard, Saddle-billed Stork, 
Black-breasted Snake-eagle, Magpie Shrike, Carmine Bee-eater, Woodland 
Kingfisher, Scarlet-chested Sunbird and many many more. Other, less frequently 
seen mammals include Gerenuk, Fringe-eared Oryx, Hunters Hartebeest and Leopard.
<br></p> 
<p> </p> <br>

<p>An undoubted highlight of our stay at Tsavo will be the opportunity to 
visit the crystal clear waters of the Mzima Springs. Here underground spring 
water, filtered by the volcanic rock of the Chyulu Hills, has formed a series 
of forest-fringed freshwater pools into which an underwater glass observation 
tank has been built. From this uniquely aquatic viewpoint we can watch Hippos 
swimming underwater along with crocodiles and various fish. Lunch, dinner and 
overnight for the two days at<b>Finch Hattons Camp</b>, full board.</p> 
<p><b>Days 4 &amp; 5: Amboseli National Park. </b>After breakfast we will move 
west to Amboseli National Park. Amboseli sits beneath the towering snow-capped 
peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, and is one of the 
country's most scenic reserves. Its acacia-dotted plains and dry rolling 
grasslands support a wealth of game including plenty of Elephant, Masai 
Giraffe, Burchell's Zebra, Cape buffalo and Waterbuck. Indeed it is here 
(weather and dust permitting) that we hope to see that classic East African 
scene of Elephants and Giraffes striding across the plains backed by the snowy 
peak of Kilimanjaro; this is one of Kenya's most sought after photographic 
destinations so bring plenty of film (or memory cards!). Other mammals to look 
out for include White-bearded Wildebeest, Thompson's Gazelle, Warthog, Black 
Rhino and Spotted Hyena. Predators such as Cheetah and Lion do occur in 
Amboseli but are somewhat wary as they are still persecuted by the surrounding 
farmers. Birdlife is once again abundant and we will no doubt find a wide 
selection of the 400 species that have been recorded here. Some to look out for 
include Bateleur, Red-billed Hornbill, Greater Blue-eared Glossy Starling, 
Tacazze Sunbird, Bare-faced Go-away Bird, Diederic and Black Cuckoos and 
White-fronted Bee-eater. We will explore Amboseli on morning and afternoon game 
drives from the<b>Tortilis Luxury Camp</b>, our base for the next <b>two nights 
</b>of the tour.</p> <br>

<p><b><br>
Days 6 &amp; 7: Lake Nakuru National Park. </b>Today we move to 
East Africa's geological wonder, the Rift Valley, for two nights at the shores 
of Lake Naivasha. It is a long drive that will take us back to Nairobi for 
lunch before heading north west into the Rift. On arrival at Lake Naivasha we 
will check in at Loldia House for two nights, beautifully situated on shores of 
the lake. The following day we will visit the flamingo fringed Lake Nakuru 
National Park. The park is a wonderfully atmospheric place, where you can 
really enjoy the sights and sounds of the Rift Valley in a classic bush 
setting. Indeed, Lake Nakuru National Park was the setting for the award 
winning classic film &#145;Out of Africa&#146;.<br>
<br>
Lake Nakuru is a soda 
lake and host to one of the great ornithological spectacles of the world. 
Hundreds of thousands of Greater and Lesser Flamingoes (occasionally up to 2 
million) traditionally form a carpet of shimmering pink that stretches as far 
as the eye can see around the lake-shore. Pink-backed and White Pelicans swim 
in the shallows and feeding amongst them are Yellow-billed and Marabou Storks, 
Sacred Ibis, African Spoonbills, and an almost complete range of east African 
ducks, waders, terns and gulls. The piercing call of the African Fish Eagles is 
a familiar sound at Nakuru and just one of numerous birds of prey that patrol 
the park. Mammals too are plentiful, particularly Bohor Reedbuck, Waterbuck, 
Buffalo, Warthog and the rare Rothchild's Giraffe, whilst anyone tiring of the 
lakeside spectacle will find more than enough birds and other wildlife in the 
surrounding scrub and woodland. Nakuru is one of the better places in Africa to 
find Leopard and the park is also a very important Rhino sanctuary. It has a 
population of over 60 Black Rhino, although these are very hard to see, and a 
healthy breeding population of White Rhino which includes a large number of 
young animals. Dinner and overnight for the two days at<b>Loldia House</b>, 
full board.&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p><b>Days 8 - 11: Masai Mara Game Reserve. </b>Morning will be spent at 
leisure and after early lunch you will be transferred to the airstrip for your 
scheduled flight to our comfortable, tented camp in the Mara, Mara Governors 
Camp. Here we will be based for three nights and this evening head out on a 
game drive to enjoy the wildlife of Kenya's top game reserve. The Masai Mara 
Game Reserve is probably the most famous in all of Africa.<br>
<br>
It is 
raising grassland, watered by the Mara River and covering an area of 1,680 
square kilometres. The Mara region has been inhabited by humans for at least 
2,000 years, the last 200 years by the Masai. The area is part of what is now 
referred to as the Serengeti - Mara Ecosystem, being joined to the huge 
Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. In the local (Maa) language Mara means 
'spotted', a reference to the patches of bush and trees that dot the 
plains.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> <br>

<p> The Masai Mara holds some of the largest concentrations of animals in the 
world, especially in August when huge herds of White-bearded Wildebeest and 
Burchell's Zebra, pursued by their attendant predators, migrate into the 
reserve from the adjacent Serengeti. This is another of Africa's great wildlife 
spectacles and, whilst nothing is certain in the world of wildlife watching, we 
hope to have timed it just right and witness the breathtaking sight of the Mara 
grasslands filled as far as the eye can see with huge herds of Wildebeest and 
Zebra. Topi, Coke's Hartebeest, Impala, Eland, Thompson's and Grant's Gazelles, 
Bohor Reedbuck, Bushbuck, Kirk's Dik-dik, Masai Giraffe, Elephant and Buffalo 
feed amongst them stalked by all 3 big cats, Lion, Cheetah and Leopard, along 
with a variety of other predators and scavengers such as Bat-eared Fox, Serval, 
Spotted Hyena and Black-backed Jackals.<br>
<br>
The birdlife is equally 
diverse, although often takes second place to the spectacle of the mammals. 
Huge Ground Hornbills and elegant secretary Birds stride across the grasslands 
along with Kori Bustards, Grey Crowned Crane and smaller species such as 
Temminck's Coursers, Wattled Lapwing, Rosy-breasted Longclaw, Yellow-shouldered 
Widowbird and Capped Wheatear. Lone bushes or dead trees provide lookout 
perches for a variety of bee-eaters and rollers, including the beautiful 
Carmine Bee-eater, whilst above them soar Martial Eagles, Lappet-faced, African 
White-backed, Hooded and Ruppell's Vultures, the latter four always on the look 
out for a recent kill. In the camp grounds and acacia woodlands we should find 
a plethora of barbets, finches, weavers, turacos, go-away-birds, glossy 
starlings and kingfishers.</p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Our days in the Mara will start with an early morning wake up call, and a 
cup of tea or coffee, before we head out onto the plains shortly after dawn. 
After enjoying the animals and birds we will return to camp late morning for 
brunch and a siesta before heading out again for an afternoon game drive. There 
are additional activities on offer for those who wish, the most popular being a 
hot air balloon ride or a Masai Village visit, a truly magical experience.<br>

<br>The costs are not included in the tour cost, however, and must be booked in 
advance so please contact the Mbango Safaris office on 00 254 20 600 14 54 for 
a price and more information.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 12: Nairobi. </b>Breakfast and 
morning to be spent at leisure at the camp. At 10 am transfer to the airstrip 
and leave the Masai Mara. Upon arrival in Nairobi you will be transferred to 
Carnivore restaurant where we will take our last meal in Kenya, before sadly 
making our way to the airport to catch the late evening flight back home.<br>

<br><b>Grading</b>. This is a luxury tented camps and lodge safari, and 
therefore suitable for anyone of any age, without any great necessity for 
extreme fitness. In all the parks we visit exploration is by vehicle only, 
though you will be allowed to walk in the grounds of each lodge and at various 
picnic spots. &nbsp;</p> <br>

<p><b>Weather. </b>For much of this August tour dry and sunny weather may be 
expected, with daytime temperatures between 20-30&deg;C, depending on the 
altitude. Cloud is likely in the afternoons, but does not usually bring rain at 
this season, although do not rule it out!<br>
<br>
<b>Food and accomondation 
included in the tour price.</b>All accommodation and meals are included except 
for dinner on arrival in Nairobi and lunch on the last day back to Nairobi.<br>

<br><b>Entry requirements. </b>A visa is required for Kenya and we will send
