<p>Your safari begins in Kenya - unrivalled for its diverse eco-systems and 
tribal cultures. You will drive across the spectacular Great Rift Valley floor 
with its prolific wildlife, stunning scenery and incredible light before 
explore Masai Mara plains teeming with wildlife.<br>
<br>
Then across into 
Tanzania to Ngorongoro Crater and the rolling plains of Serengeti where the 
greatest migration starts and ends; a trip back in time to the origins of man 
as we explore the Olduvai Cradle of Mankind. This is a genuine safari 
experience that you will treasure forever.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 1: Flight to Nairobi.
</b>On arrival transfer to <b>Ole Sereni Hotel </b>for a good nights sleep.<br>

<br><b>Days 2 &amp; 3: Lake Nakuru National Park. </b>After breakfast we depart 
for Lake Nakuru National Park a salty Rift valley lake and a Rhino Sanctuary: 
the soda lake attracts thousands of pink flamingos.</p> <br>

<p>Lake Nakuru National Park is world famous for its population of lesser 
flamingo&#146;s and both Black and White Rhinoceros where we are going to spend 
the next two days looking for the different birds and wildlife species found 
here including the endangered Black Rhinoceros and the elusive Leopard. Two 
overnights at<b>Flamingo Hill Tented Camp.</b></p> 
<p><b>Days 4 - 6: Masai Mara Game Reserve. </b>Drive to Masai Mara, justiably 
the world's most famous wildlife spectable.The Masai Mara is probably the most 
famous wildlife reserve in Africa. It is rising grassland, watered by the Mara 
River and covering an area of 1500 square kilometers of wilderness. The Mara 
region has been inhabited by man for at least 2,000 years, the last 200 
years&nbsp;by the Maasai. The area is part of what is now referred to as the 
Serengeti - Mara Eco-system, being joined&nbsp;to the huge Serengeti National 
Park in Tanzania. In the local (Maa) language Mara means spotted, which is a 
reference to the patches of bush and trees on the plains. Days will be spent 
game viewing and enjoying the Masai Mara.<br>
<br>
Early morning game drives 
set off at sunrise with bush breakfast in the wilderness in the morning 
sunlight and return to lodge hours later for lunch. During the heat of the day, 
relax and appreciate the silence, punctuated only by birdcalls.<br>
<br>

Afternoon game drives returns after sundown, after which you can freshen up and 
gather round the campfire for pre-dinner drinks. Dinner is served in the 
restaurant. A nightcap by the fire can be enjoyed before retiring to your 
comfortable room.<br>
<br>
The guides will be on hand to show you the flora of 
the area and explain the traditional Masai uses of the respective trees and 
plants. There will be plenty of time during the safari to visit a Maasai 
village and learn about the Masai culture and to get a feel for this 
fascinating area of Africa.Lunch, dinner and overnight at <b>Mara Serena Lodge
</b>.</p> <br>

<p><b>Days 7 - 9: Serengeti National Park. </b>Drive to Serengeti National 
Park. Serengeti is a prisitine wilderness known for its vast herds of plains 
game. Perhaps the greater wildlife spectacle in the world, the Serengeti 
belongs to the animals and no one else. Limitless grassy plains, scattered with 
rocky outcrops, acacia bush land and riverine forest, cover 14,673 square 
kilometers. The park contains nearly 40 species of large mammals, which in 
February, includes nearly two million white-bearded wildebeest, 200,000 
Burchell&#146;s Zebra, 300,000 Thompson&#146;s gazelles and an amazing 2,000 
lions. Amongst a wealth of other species we hope to see are Impala, 
Grant&#146;s gazelle, Eland, giraffe, and warthog, Kirk&#146;s Dik-dik, 
Waterbuck, Topi and Hartebeest. This abundance of prey is pursued by many 
predator including Cheetahs, leopard, Serval Cats, Golden and Black-backed 
Jackals, spotted hyena and Bat-eared Foxes.<br>
<br>
We will undoubtedly see 
more of them, but exactly which ones will depend on our luck! From February to 
June, however, mammal viewing is at its best. This is the time of year that the 
vast herds of wildebeest move into the Serengeti from the Masai Mara to the 
north, in order to drop their calves and feed on the lush grass watered by the 
short rains.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p> With the herds come the predators. There is of course, no guarantee, but 
we will endeavor to follow them as far as possible &#150; for sheer mammalian 
spectacle, there is simply no better coincidence of time and place!<br>
<br>

Inevitably this feast of wildlife will eclipse the parks&#146; birdlife, but 
the latter cannot be ignored. Huge Ground Hornbills and elegant Secretary Birds 
stride across the grasslands along with Kori Bustards, grey Crowned Crane and 
smaller species such as Temminck&#146;s Coursers, Wattled Lapwing, 
Rosy-breasted Long claw, yellow-Shouldered widowbird and capped Wheatear. Lone 
bushes or dead trees provide lookout perches for a variety of bee-eaters and 
rollers, including the beautiful carmine bee-eater, whilst above them soar 
Martial Eagles, lappet-faced, African White-backed, hooded and Ruppell&#146;s 
Vultures, the latter four always on the look out for a recent kill. In the 
lodge grounds and acacia woodlands we should find a plethora of barbets, 
finches, weavers, Turacos, go-away-birds, glossy starlings and kingfishers. We 
will enjoy three ull board nights in the Serengeti, at the<b> Serengeti Serena 
Lodge</b> in the heart of the reserve.<br>
<br>
<b>Days 10 &amp; 11: Ngorongoro 
Crater and Conservation Area.</b>Drive to Ngorongoro Crater and conservation 
area, a natural enclosed eco-system, the crater floor is a world haven. Eight 
million years ago Ngorongoro was an active volcano. Its cone collapsed forming 
a massive caldera, covering 311 square kilometers and creating one of the most 
scenic spectacles in all of Africa and the &#145;eighth wonder of the 
world&#146;.<br>
<br>
Over 600 meters deep and 20 kilometers across, the 
caldera is covered by extensive grassland, patches of forest, marshes and lakes 
whilst attractive motane forest clings to the rim. Unlike other ecological 
systems in Africa, Ngorongoro is permanently watered and therefore able to 
support a resident population of animals.<br>
<br>
It is home to over 30,000 
large mammals including White Bearded Wildebeest, African Buffalo, 
Burchell&#146;s Zebra, Grant&#146;s and Thompson&#146;s Gazelles, African 
Elephant, Black Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Lion, Spotted Hyena and Black Backed 
Jackal. Indeed, Ngorongoro is one of the few places in Africa where the 
&#145;Big 5&#148; (Buffalo, elephant, Leopard, Lion and rhino) can be seen 
together.<br>
<br>
The birdlife is no less spectacular. An exciting range of 
water birds includes many species of ducks, geese, waders, storks and hundreds 
of thousands of flamingoes. Then there are the bustards, cranes, widowbirds, 
francolins and cisticolas to be found in the grassland and an equally diverse 
range of forest species!<br>
<br>
We will fully explore this wonderful area on 
morning game drives followed by a bush breakfast down at the crater returning 
to our lodge for lunch. The Ngorongoro Crater is undoubtedly one of the very 
best areas for photography - make sure you bring plenty of memory cards. Two 
full board overnights at<b>Ngorongoro Serena Lodge</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Days 12 
&amp; 13: Amboseli National Park.</b>Drive across the border to Kenya's 
Amboseli National Park. Amboseli national park offers one of the most classic 
and breathtaking views of the gigantic Kilimanjaro mountain, with it's 5,985 m 
dominating the plains like a powerful God ruling the world from his silverstone.
<br><br>
The park is 392 km2 in size with the eco-system that spreads the Kenya 
- Tanzania border, the park is famous for being the best place in Africa to get 
close to free-ranging elephants herds, abundant wildlife and plains game. Other 
attractions of the park include includes the opportunity to meet Maasai and 
spectacular views of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in 
the world. Two full board overnights at<b>Amboseli Serena Lodge.<br>
<br>
</b>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Day 14: Amboseli to Nairobi. </b>Sadly, today we have to leave Amboseli 
which has been our home and wildlife theatre for the last two days for a return 
drive to Nairobi.&nbsp;On our eventful arrival back at Nairobi, we will make 
our way to a restaurant for lunch and then to Ole Sereni Hotel for day room. 
Later you will be transferred to airport for your outbound flight back home.<br>
<br><b>Focus. </b>This is a safari, covering all aspects of general wildlife 
including both mammal viewing and bird watching. You will spend 14 days in 
Kenya and Tanzania in a truly spectacular game viewing area, surrounded by 
traditional flat-topped acacia trees, thorny scrublands and the bright 
red-cloaked Masai people dotted across the plains.<br>
<br>
<b>Weather. </b>The

&quot;A superb tour which fully lived up to 
expectations. Mammal sightings included 16 cheetahs, 10 Black Rhinos, Lions 
galore and 1m+ Wildebeests. Timing of the tour was perfect, coinciding with 
incredible numbers of animals in the Southern Serengeti. The guides were really 
excellent.&quot; D.Mike, New Hampshire.<br>
