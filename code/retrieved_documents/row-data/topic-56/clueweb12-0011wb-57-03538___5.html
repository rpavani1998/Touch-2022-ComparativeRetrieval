AfricanMecca Customer Reviews<br>
<br>
</b><b>Kenya Safari &amp; Beach 
Experience With AfricanMecca<br>
</b>Jambo Raza, As always your personal 
service and attention are unrivaled!! Governors Il Moran and Funzi Keys were 
first class in everything that they did. They were both remarkable and very 
memorable, kind, courteous, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Both are 
world leaders in their class. Please be assured that we hold both AfricanMecca 
and East Africa in the highest regards and many of our friends have been so 
impressed with what we have told them that I am sure they will be in touch. We 
had a marvelous time and are still reliving our holiday through our photographs.

Tanzania Safari Beach 
Experience With AfricanMecca<br>
</b>We had a wonderful time on our trip and 
our expectations were exceeded by your excellent planning. The arrival and 
transport to the hotel went smoothly. The Tanzania safari was a trip that will 
remain in our memories as one of the best experiences ever. The guide we had 
for the safari was named Babu and he was professional, knowledgeable and 
attentive. The accommodations you chose for us were spectacular. Each of the 
three having their own unique character and charm. I can't say enough about the 
hospitality, excellent food and comfortable accommodations that were provided 
by each of the lodges/camps. To be able to experience the beauty and wonder of 
Tanzania in safety and comfort is something we are thankful for. Matemwe 
Bungalows were very nice and the food was very good also. I am sure to mention 
your company whenever I tell people of my adventures and recommend you highly. 
I will definitely use your company for any future trips to Africa. On behalf of 
Erin and myself thank you again for making this the trip of a lifetime. <br>
