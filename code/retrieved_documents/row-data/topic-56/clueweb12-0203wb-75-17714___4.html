<h1>Ultimate Kenya &amp; Tanzania Safari - NEW TRIP</h1>  Experience a 
Collection of Some of the Most Renowned Wildlife Reserves in Africa<br>
 Kenya 
and Tanzania; the very words evoke a bygone era of romance and adventure 
&ndash; seas of golden grass swaying from blue horizon to blue horizon, nights 
spent staring into crackling campfires beneath skies starry beyond imagination, 
beholding the timeless drama of life and death, between predator and prey, 
unfolding yet again on one of earth&rsquo;s last, great, wild stages. This 
world still exists and is waiting to be discovered once more, by you, on our 
Ultimate Kenya &amp; Tanzania Safari.<br>

inclusive itinerary</li>

entire safari experience</li> </ul> <strong>Location of Adventure</strong> <br>

Kenya &amp; Tanzania, East Africa <br>
<strong>Group Size Limit</strong> <br>

<strong>Approximately 12 Travelers </strong> <br>
 A very important feature of 
our trips is the limited group size as nature expeditions are best experienced 
with smaller sized groups of travelers. <br>
<strong>Included</strong> <br>

Internal scheduled and light aircraft flights, accommodations, meals from 
dinner Day 1 to lunch final day, non-alcoholic drinks at camps and&nbsp;with 
meals, house alcoholic beverages, services of NHA Expedition Leaders, local 
guides, and camp and lodge staff, some gratuities, airport transfers on Day 1 
and final day, permits &amp; entrance fees, and all taxes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Not 
Included</strong> <br>
Travel to and from start and end point of trip, premium 
alcoholic beverages, some gratuities, passport and visa fees, optional 
activities, items of a personal nature (phone calls, souvenirs, etc.), airline 
baggage fees, airport and departure taxes, optional travel insurance, and 
required medical evacuation insurance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Physical 
Requirements</strong> <br>
<em>Easy/Flexible</em> <br>
 Our walking activities 
are usually short and optional. We do, however, recommend that travelers who 
participate in these programs be of an adventurous spirit, as they will often 
enjoy the very closest of animal encounters and safari vehicles can sometimes 
offer a bumpy ride. <br>
<strong>Important Information</strong> <br>
This 
comprehensive itinerary is designed to show travelers the very best wildlife 
destinations these two countries have to offer. We will have two different 
Expedition Leaders on this trip, one for Kenya, and another Tanzania, to allow 
each guide to impart expert knowledge about his respective country to our 
guests. <br>
<strong>Getting There &amp; Getting Home</strong> <br>
You must 
arrive in Nairobi, Kenya before 6:30pm on Day 1 and may depart Arusha, Tanzania 
anytime after 5pm on the final day. We can best serve you if Natural Habitat 
Adventures&rsquo; Travel Desk makes these reservations for you as they are 
intimately familiar with the special requirements of these programs and can 
arrange the most efficient and cost-effective travel. Please call us at 
1-800-543-8917.<br>
