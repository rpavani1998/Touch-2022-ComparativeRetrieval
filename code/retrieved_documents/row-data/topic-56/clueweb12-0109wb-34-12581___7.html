1. What immunizations / shots are required? Back to Top 
<br> Currently, there is no any immunizations/shots required IN ORDER to get 
into East Africa (Tanzania/Kenya/Uganda) unless prior to your arrival you go 
thru countries that are infected with yellow fever/cholera or other diseases. 
However for accurate and most updated info please visit the embassies for a 
country you plan on visiting (Tanzania / Kenya / Uganda) <br>
&nbsp; <br>
2. 
Would you recommend Malaria Medication? Back to Top <br>
Yes, because its very 
common in East Africa. Among recommended tables for this include Malarone and 
Larium. We also, recommend insect repellents in addition to the above and also 
to get away from the bugs on the safari that might bother you (though not that 
many). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
3. Can i get visa upon arrival? Back to Top <br>
We 
recommend you visit the embassies websites for the most updated info on visas 
including costs for the visas. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
4. I am also solo (single) 
traveler, How can i join your tour? Back to Top <br>

<p>We recommend you email us with as much details as you can so that we can 
check and see whether we have a room for you or not.</p> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
5. 
How soon do i have to book your tour? Back to Top <br>
We recommend at least 6 
months before a day you plan to start a safari. However, the earlier the better.
<br> &nbsp; <br>
6. Do you customize the tour? Back to Top <br>
Yes, we do! We 
would need to know the following: your budget, places you want to stay/visit, 
number of nights at each place, month of travel, number of people in your group 
and any other info. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
7. Where is the best place / time to go? 
Back to Top <br>
Tanzania is considered by many as the best place to go on a 
safari. Thebelow chart can also give you an idea on places to go and best time 
to go to those places. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
8. What is the migration? Back to Top 
<br> Animal Migration means periodic change of animal movement from one place 
to another, and in East Africa its referred to Serengeti and Mara parks. In 
late May / early June migration (mainly wildebeests and zebras) begin their 
annual migration from north of Serengeti to the Mara crossing the Mara river, 
reaching Masai Mara park sometime in mid July /early August depending on rain 
endings. After the short rains in the month of November, the herds move back 
into Serengeti and make their way to the southern pastures where they rest and 
feed through the rains until their search for better grazing leads them to 
begin their annual migration once again. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
9. When will the 
wildebeests/Zebra calving seasons? Back to Top <br>
This occurs in late January 
~ mid March, with thousands of them born daily within that one month period. At 
this time most animals are in southern Serengeti. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
10. What is 
the whether like in East Africa? Back to Top <br>
Generally, typical temp in 
most places of east Africa is: Mid August to April, day and night time 
temperatures of about 75 to 80&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s and 
70 to 80&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s degrees Fahrenheit, and 
from May to early August, day and night time temperatures of about 55 to 
70&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s and 50 and 45 to 65 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Rain season is in the months of March, April, May and November. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
11. Do you accommodate people with dietary restrictions? Back to Top
<br> Absolutely! Our skilled cooks are happy to accommodate your dietary 
restrictions and/or allergies. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
