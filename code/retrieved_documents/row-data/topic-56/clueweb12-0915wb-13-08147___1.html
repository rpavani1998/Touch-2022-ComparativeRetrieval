<p><strong>THE HOST COMMUNITY&rsquo;S BACKGROUND </strong><br>
We consider the 
vulnerability of the community stake holders (children, youth and adult). 
Generally, economic activities in our host communities are tree felling for 
wood fuel and charcoal burning, and&nbsp; brewing of illicit drinks which 
sometimes turn to be deadly on consumption.<br>
<br>
A number of people 
practise small scale fishing. Many youth are wasted due to poor economic 
capacity build up and turn to drug abuse to escape misery and stress of 
hopelessness.</p> 
<p><strong>ABIMBO VILLAGE</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Social Amenities:</strong>
<br>-Accessibiliy to the village is poor due to lack of good road network and 
surrounding public schools are under-developed and under-staffed.<br>
<br>

-There are no village based health facilities eg clinics,dispensaries and 
people rely on government centralised health centers several miles away:- This 
increases infant mortality rate, poor community health and prevention from 
mother to child transmission of HIV/Aids (PMTCT) at birth becomes a problem as 
many child deliveries happen at home (village) under unqualified mid-wives.<br>

<br>-Many girl children are subjected to early marriage due to poverty 
conditions. While generally youths are infected and affected by HIV/aids 
scourge making them inactive towards community development process, thus, 
affecting the gross domestic production, hence poor living condition.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>MAJOR PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL:</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>1: Volunteer in Education:</strong></p> 
<p>This program focuses on the Kenya primary schools attended by orphans and 
the most vulnerable children in the villages of Western Kenya. It is an 
initiative by Volunteer students abroad on a trip to Kenya and the Kenya 
volunteer students and social workers, that through their volunteer program 
help to improve the learning conditions of the Kenya community based Primary 
public Schools,mostly attended by poor children who hardly have anything to eat 
at home,or get very little meal that cannot sustain their stay in school for a 
whole day!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>2: Volunteer in Community Healthcare:</strong></p> 
<p>Health care is a fundamental aspect in Kenya, especially when we consider 
our village based programs and outreaches. Of the<strong>global ill health 
reports</strong>,<strong> 24%</strong> of the cases are registered in Africa 
with access to very few health workers, averagely<strong>3%</strong> to attend 
to the ill health problems. Most communities in Africa still depend on either 
witch doctors or traditional herbalists, the latter who are not trained, 
cunning and don&rsquo;t have specific prescriptions for their medicines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>3: Volunteer in economic Empowerment:</strong></p> 
<p>We empower the community stakeholders economically through self-sustainable 
initiatives for income generating activities. The empowerment workshops are 
organized at the community resource center where tailoring and dress making 
classes are conducted on voluntary basis.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>4: Volunteer on Environmental care:</strong></p> 
<p>-Through planting trees, we hope to improve water catchment areas and 
revive our lost glory on climate. We therefore encourage the establishment of 
tree nurseries to distribute seedlings for planting.</p> 
<p>-We lead the society in establishing proper disposal units through 
provision of dumping facilities e.g for garbage, etc</p> 
<p>- We are in the forefront on campaigns that encourage clean water 
provision, this is done through establishing water storage facilities which 
include plastic water tanks, brick, built under ground water tanks and ceramic 
treatments ( filters).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>5: Volunteer in Community Support initiative:</strong></p> 
<p>-This helps Provide space and opportunity for community workshops, forums 
and seminars.</p> 
<p>-Provides volunteers with resources, equipment and personals for the 
community needs.</p> 
<p>-Lead the community on better standards of education by establishing a 
quality learning institution for early childhood development, education.<br>

-Provides a source of local and international volunteers&rsquo; with knowledge 
and skills to develop and uplift the standards of living within the host 
community.</p>
