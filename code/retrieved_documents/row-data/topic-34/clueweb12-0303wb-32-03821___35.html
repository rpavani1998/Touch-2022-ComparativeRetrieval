<h3>Caring for Cloth Grocery Bags</h3> 
<p> <br>
<br>
Reusable cloth grocery bags are a great way to help drastically 
reduce the number of plastic &quot;disposable&quot; grocery bags that end up in 
landfills. Those plastic bags, which are made from nonrenewable petrochemicals, 
can take more than 1,000 years to decompose! Though cloth grocery bags are more 
environmentally friendly, their longer life spans mean they can become moldy or 
messy with frequent reuse. Here are some tips on storing and cleaning your 
cloth bags, including how to remember to use them each time you go to the 
store.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Storing<br>
</strong>Cloth grocery bags are reasonably inexpensive 
and don't take up much room, so my wife and I both keep several in our 
cars&mdash;then there's no way we can leave home without them. Storing these 
bags near your grocery list can be helpful too. After a while, you'll 
instinctively reach for the bags when you grab the list. To find a broad 
selection of reusable cloth grocery bags in styles and patterns you'll be proud 
to carry with you, visitreusit.com. Keeping plenty of these good looking and 
eco-friendly alternatives around will make it easy to remember to use 
them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Cleaning<br>
</strong>Some grocery items can be messy, especially 
meat, produce, and frozen food. Watch out for any leaks or drips on your 
reusable bags that could cause mold or contaminate other foods. Even if your 
bags look clean, washing them every few uses is a good idea. After all, they 
carry the food that will end up on your plate!&nbsp;Many reusable cloth bags 
can be thrown in the washing machine alongside your clothes. Bags with plastic 
inserts in the bottom for rigidity should be hand washed. Because cloth bags 
can be made from a variety of materials, including hemp, bamboo, and burlap, 
check the bags for any washing instructions. When in doubt, hand wash bags in 
hot, soapy water and let them air dry.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Electric Space Heater Buying Guide</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>A space heater eats plenty of energy, but it doesn't use nearly as much as 
your furnace. Place one in a drafty room to supplement heat, rather than crank 
up your furnace, and you'll save energy and money. Here's what to look for when 
buying one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Thermostat and Adjustable Power Levels&nbsp;<br>
</strong>Choosing 
a space heater with a thermostat and adjustable power levels allows you to set 
the temperature and power as low as possible to comfortably heat your room and 
avoid energy waste.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Oscillating Blower Fan<br>
</strong>A space heater with an 
oscillating blower fan warms a space quickly and efficiently. A unit with a 
higher heat output but no oscillating fan leaves a room feeling colder than one 
with a lower output and a fan.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Overheat Protection and Tip-Over Switch<br>
</strong>According to 
theU.S. Department of Energy, 25,000 residential fires are started every year 
as a result of space heaters, leading to more than 300 deaths and 6,000 
emergency room visits for burns. Fortunately, many new heaters come with great 
safety features. One is overheat protection, which automatically turns off the 
unit when the heat rises to high. Another is a tip-over switch, which shuts off 
the unit if it falls over. Some units even have infrared sensors that cut off 
power if anything gets too close to the heater&mdash;a handy feature for those 
with kids or pets.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Testing Company Approved<br>
</strong>Always look for space heaters 
that have been tested and labeled by a nationally recognized and reputable 
testing company such as theUnderwriter's Laboratories Inc. (UL). 
Many&nbsp;companies manufacture cheap imitations of popular brands, but these 
devices are untested and possibly dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ice Dam Prevention</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Nothing beats a cozy house when you're surrounded by snow. But that warm 
home may cause ice dams. When heat escapes from your attic, it melts the snow 
on your roof, and if it's cold enough outside, that melting snow may refreeze, 
creating ice dams.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You know those glittering icicles hanging from your home? They're a 
telltale sign that ice dams are forming, and your home is losing heat and 
energy much faster than it should be. As they form, ice dams force water under 
your roof covering and into your attic or exterior walls, causing serious 
damage to your home. Here are some tips to keep them away.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Prevention<br>
</strong>The best method for dealing with ice dams 
is to prevent them from forming. You can do this by properly ventilating and 
insulating your attic. By ventilating your attic, you make sure the warm air 
from inside your home is being replaced with colder outdoor air and the 
temperature inside your attic stays as close to the temperature outside as 
possible.&nbsp;Also check your attic insulation. If it's lacking, you can try 
insulating your attic yourself. (It's often one of the easiest rooms in your 
house to insulate.) For specific instructions, visit the U.S. Department of 
Energy'ssite.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Solutions<br>
If ice dams form on your home before you're able to 
ventilate and insulate your attic, you may want to call in a licensed 
contractor to remove them safely and effectively. If you plan to&nbsp;</strong>
remove the dams yourself, avoid getting on the roof. Instead, use a roof rake 
and push broom to pull the ice and snow down the slope of your roof while 
you're on the ground. But be careful. Removing an ice dam can be dangerous.</p> 
<p>Never use salt or calcium chloride to melt the snow because the chemicals 
are highly corrosive and will damage metal gutters, downspouts, and 
flashings.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Favorite Salt Uses</h3> 
<p>With winter upon us, we in the midwest can expect plenty of icy roadways 
covered in salt. And in that form, salt is a mixed blessing&mdash;great for 
de-icing and traction, but bad for the metal on our vehicles. When it comes to 
household applications, however, salt is pretty much always a handy mineral. 
Here are a few of our favorite uses for salt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sink De-Clogger<br>
</strong>A strong salt-water solution can 
reduce odors, eliminate minor clogs, and cut down on grease buildup.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Flower Freshener<br>
</strong>Blending a little salt and baking 
soda with the water in your flower vase can help to extend the longevity of 
your bouquet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Coffee Pot Cleaner<br>
</strong>Mixing salt, water, lemon and ice 
together makes a powerful, all-natural cleaning agent that won't distort the 
flavor of your coffee after cleaning and doesn't leave soap residue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Brass, Copper, and Pewter Polish<br>
</strong>Dissolve one teaspoon 
of salt in a cup of distilled white vinegar and stir until it becomes a paste. 
Apply to the metal and let sit for 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you have a great way of using salt around your home? Be sure to 
visit&nbsp;Morton&reg; Salt&rsquo;s website&nbsp;to&nbsp;share your favorite 
&quot;salt secret.&quot; You may win a $1,000 AMEX gift card!</p>

<h3>LEED Certification</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Building a new home that is truly &ldquo;green&rdquo; can be far more 
difficult than most would imagine. Finding a contractor who shares your vision, 
securing environmentally responsible materials and appliances, and juggling the 
typical stress of building a home can be overwhelming. Fortunately, 
there&rsquo;s a system that can help: LEED.</p> 
<p><strong>What It Does<br>
</strong>Developed by the U.S. Green Building 
Council, LEED gives builders and homeowners a specific framework for green 
construction. Encompassing all building types, the LEED system emphasizes and 
awards credits based on nine key areas:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><em>Sustainable Sites:</em>&nbsp;discourages development on previously 
undeveloped land, emphasizing erosion and light pollution reduction, and 
minimizing impact on ecosystems and waterways.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><em>Water Efficiency</em>: encourages smarter use of potable water inside 
and outside the building.</li> 
<li><em>Energy and Atmosphere</em>: emphasizes the use of renewable and clean 
sources of energy and energy-efficient building design and construction</li> 
<li><em>Materials and Resources</em>: encourages material and resource waste 
reduction during the construction process and the use of sustainably grown, 
harvested, produced or transported products and materials.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><em>Indoor Environmental Quality</em>: emphasizes strategies that improve 
indoor air and provide access to natural daylight</li> 
<li><em>Locations and Linkages</em>: rewards homes that are built near 
already-existing infrastructure, community resources and transit.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><em>Awareness and Education</em>: credits home builders and real estate 
professionals for providing homeowners, tenants, and building managers with the 
education and tools to understand how to use their home to its maximum green 
potential.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><em>Innovation in Design</em>: credits construction that uses new and 
innovative technologies to improve a building's performance beyond what is 
required by LEED.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><em>Regional Priority</em>: identifies environmental concerns that are 
regionally specific and awards credits for projects that address those 
concerns.&nbsp;</li> </ol> 
<ul> </ul> 
<p><strong>Finding a LEED Certified Builder<br>
</strong>If a builder is LEED 
certified, you can be certain that they will build your house to the highest 
green standards. To find a LEED certified builder in your area, visit theUSGBC 
member directory.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slow Drain, Natural Cures</h3> 
<p> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>A stubborn drain clog can be difficult to remove, but before you head for 
the dangerously potent commercial drain cleaner, try these natural, 
easy-on-the-environment mixtures that will get the job done too.&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1/2 cup salt + 1 gallon hot water: If your drain is slow to empty, this 
simple saltwater concoction may be enough to free up any trapped debris.&nbsp;
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>1 cup washing soda + 1 gallon hot water: For a more aggressive solution, 
washing soda (sodium carbonate, a key ingredient in toothpaste and glassmaking) 
is abrasive enough to loosen clogs. If the pipes leading from your drain are 
PVC (polyvinyl chloride), avoid regular use of washing soda&mdash;it can eat 
away at the plastic over time.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>1 cup baking soda + 1 cup distilled white vinegar: harkening back to our 
days in grade school science class, the baking soda and vinegar 
&quot;volcano&quot; can actually be very effective at clearing clogged drains. 
After removing water from the sink, pour your baking soda in, follow with 
vinegar, and quickly plug the drain. After the bubbles recede (in roughly 30 
minutes), rinse with hot water.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not use vinegar or washing soda if you have 
already applied a commercial drain cleaner&mdash;these ingredients can react 
with other chemicals, creating harmful or even lethal gas fumes.&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> </ul>

<h3>Tax Credits for Energy-Efficient Home Improvements</h3> 
<p>The next time you complete an energy-saving renovation project in your 
home, you may qualify for federal, state, and local tax credits based on the 
costs of those improvements. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> <br>
Understanding what you qualify for can be tricky, so here are the 
basics:&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Some tax credits&mdash;like those for installing a heat pump or water 
heater&mdash;include the cost of installation. Others&mdash;like those for 
installing insulation, doors, or windows&mdash;do not.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Renovations made to rental properties or secondary homes often do not 
qualify for tax credits. New construction also does not qualify.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>If you made an improvement to your windows and doors, insulation, roof, 
HVAC system, nonsolar water heater, or biomass stove between January 1, 2009 
and December 31, 2010, you may be eligible for 30 percent of the cost up to 
$1,500.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>If you invest in a geothermal heat pump, solar panels, solar water 
heaters, small wind energy systems, or fuel cells before December 31, 2016, 
you're eligible for 30 percent of those costs with no upper limit. That means 
if you spend $6,000 on a small wind energy system, you'll receive an $1,800 
credit on your federal income taxes.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p>Visit the U.S. Department of Energy's database of state and local 
incentives, and check out the Alliance to Save Energy's list of federal 
assistance.&nbsp;You can also&nbsp;visit&nbsp;ENERGY STAR's website&nbsp;for 
tips on filling out tax forms and a list of ENERGY STAR products that qualify 
for rebates.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Natural Solutions For Pet Pests</h3> 
<p> When Fido or Mittens is assaulted by fleas, it's easy to run to the pet 
store and grab the first anti-flea treatment you can find. However, many 
commercial pest solutions are pumped so full of chemicals that they may do more 
harm than good.&nbsp;Why not try putting nature to work against nature instead? 
Here are some natural, healthy ways to eliminate or prevent pet pests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fleas<br>
</strong>To get rid of fleas, try sprinkling diatomaceous 
earth on your pet's coat, bedding, and even the floors of your home. 
Diatomaceous earth, a&nbsp;natural rock dust consisting of fossilized algae, 
contains microscopic particles that are sharp enough to penetrate a flea's 
exoskeleton and dehydrate it until it dies. The product is widely available at 
lawn-and-garden centers. As a preventive measure, try sprinkling your pet's 
coat with brewer's yeast. It's disagreeable to fleas and harmless if your pet 
licks it off.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Ticks<br>
</strong>Many of the same tricks that work with fleas can 
be used against ticks, since both pests feed on your pet's blood. For example, 
adding a little apple-cider vinegar to your pet's water helps make the animal 
less appealing to the unpleasant arachnids from the inside out. You can also 
try making an anti-tick citrus solution by placing a sliced lemon in boiling 
water and letting it steep overnight. Use a spray bottle to apply the solution 
to your pet's body. Be sure to spray in problem areas&mdash;behind your pet's 
ears, around the head, at the base of the tail, and in the armpits.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Mosquitoes<br>
</strong>Mosquitoes pose a two-part problem: their 
bites not only leave an unpleasant itch but can also infect your pet with 
heartworm. Though you should keep your pet on a regular regimen of heartworm 
medication as prescribed by your vet, some additional topical solutions can 
help. For example, the vapors from Vicks VapoRub, when applied to your pet's 
coat, tend to keep mosquitoes at bay. There are also cedar oil sprays and 
shampoos sold in pet stores that function as natural insect repellents. Just be 
sure to use only the varieties designed for use on pets. Cedar insecticides 
intended for garden or outdoor use can be hazardous to your pet's health.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Until next time,&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Geodesic Dome Houses</h3> 
<p> <br>
Photo courtesy of Timberline Geodesics.</p> 
<p>If you've been thinking of building your own home, why not build an 
energy-efficient, weather resistant, affordable, and totally unique one? 
Geodesic domes are available in manufactured kits that allow you (yes, you 
personally!) to build a home with only minimal construction knowledge and a 
handful of common tools. The structures are eye-catching and have many 
advantages over conventional homes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Weather Resistance<br>
</strong>A geodesic dome is one of the 
strongest building designs because it is comprised of triangular panels that 
form a sphere. By its very nature, a sphere has 1/3 less surface area than a 
comparable box-style structure, which allows air to pass over the dome with 
less resistance. The spherical design also distributes stress more evenly, 
reducing the effect of strong winds, tectonic shifting, and large amounts of 
snow.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Energy Efficiency<br>
</strong>Because a geodesic dome has less 
exposed surface area than a conventional home, outside weather has less impact 
on indoor temperatures, making the dome an extremely efficient structure to 
heat and cool. Additionally, the curve of the sphere causes internal air to 
circulate much more efficiently. There's a reason why radar towers in 
Antarctica incorporate the geodesic design!</p> 
<p><strong>Comparable Costs<br>
</strong>Though costs vary, you can expect to 
pay less than $40,000 for a 40-foot-diameter dome, which provides about 2,000 
square feet of interior space. Seems like a fantastic price, right? Well, it 
is. But don't forget the cost of finishing the interior, wiring for 
electricity, installing plumbing, and all the other work that goes into making 
a house habitable. In the end, the cost is about the same as other homes.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p><strong>Additional Benefits<br>
</strong>Geodesic dome houses are totally 
customizable&mdash;you can add windows, skylights, and additional rooms off the 
center sphere with little effort. In fact, most manufacturers offer to build 
custom designs at minimal added cost. Because there is no need for load-bearing 
walls to hold up the roof, the interior of your dome is open to accommodate any 
design or layout you can envision.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information on geodesic homes, visit Timberline Geodesics.</p>

<h3>Replace An Old Showerhead</h3> 
<p>  &nbsp;<br>
It's a bit funny how we tend to overlook the things we use 
most often. The excess dripping of a showerhead, for instance, might go 
unnoticed day after day. When we do become aware of the problem, fixing it can 
get demoted to the bottom of our to-do list&mdash;after all, it still<em>works
</em>, right?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This weekend, make it a priority to treat yourself to a more enjoyable 
shower, lower heating bill, and good feelings from helping out the environment. 
Installinga low-flow showerhead can be an inexpensive repair (showerheads range 
anywhere from $10 to $200) that is too easy not to do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Replacement low-flow showerhead</li> 
<li>Teflon tape (thread seal tape)</li> 
<li>Wrench</li> 
<li>Ten minutes</li> </ul> <strong>Preparation</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>Firmly turn off your shower faucets&mdash;this should be a dry process from 
beginning to end. Next, unscrew your old showerhead. The neck of the showerhead 
should be flat where it meets the wall pipe&mdash;this is meant for your 
wrench. You may find it's a bit reluctant to unscrew, particularly if it's been 
in use for many years. After its removal, clean the wall pipe's threads of any 
residual Teflon tape or pipe compound.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p> 
<p>Tightly wrap your new Teflon tape clockwise around the wall pipe's threads 
four or five times. Applying the tape in a clockwise direction will make sure 
the showerhead won't work against the tape seam when you tighten it during 
installation. Avoid wrapping the tape above the threads, as it will show after 
the showerhead is installed. It might be a small thing, but it'll irk you 
later.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your new showerhead comes with a rubber washer, place the washer inside 
the showerhead and hand-tighten<em>only</em>. Over-tightening (as is prone to 
happen with a wrench) will force the washer into the wall pipe, creating all 
manner of trouble.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your showerhead doesn't come with a washer, tighten it firmly with a 
wrench. Be careful to avoid cross threading the new showerhead with the threads 
on the wall pipe&mdash;this is particularly easy to do with aluminum, since 
it's a fairly soft metal.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not too hard, right? Go enjoy your new shower!</p> 
<p>Until next time,&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Keep Your Refrigerator Smelling New</h3> 
<p>  My wife and I just moved out of our apartment, which brought with it the 
necessity to venture into the long-neglected recesses of our refrigerator. It 
quickly became clear that we had not been especially diligent in keeping our 
refrigerator at its cleanest or best-smelling.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's easy to lose track of how long food has been refrigerated, and it 
doesn't take long before the resulting smells seem ingrained in the very 
composition of the refrigerator. Here are a few easy tips for getting rid of 
those unwanted odors without replacing your fridge or using harsh 
chemicals.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Conduct a thorough cleaning.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Empty your refrigerator and scrub the interior with a mixture of water and 
baking soda. This should remove any trace of forgotten spills or food bits that 
have slipped through the cracks and gone unnoticed. Though it's a difficult 
space to reach, cleaning underneath your fridge will have a significant effect 
on smell too&mdash;fans under the fridge can bring outside odors in.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Freshen the air.</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are several ways to try freshening your fridge's air. One is to place 
activated charcoal in a small bowl at the back of your refrigerator to start 
pulling residual smells out. The traditional open container of baking soda is a 
tried-and-true method that works well too. Though unorthodox, you may even 
consider putting a small amount of clean, unscented kitty litter in the fridge 
as a means to absorb smells. Vanilla extract and fresh coffee grounds can also 
absorb unwanted scents when placed in the fridge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Toss the old food.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Though it's difficult to remember the expiration dates on 
everything that enters your fridge, it's worthwhile to try. If something has 
gone bad or you suspect it has passed its prime&mdash;pitch it! The unpleasant 
odors in the fridge come from decomposing food&mdash;not something you want to 
keep alongside your future meals.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Find out how long your food stays safe when the power goes out.</p> 
<p>Until next time,&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pest Problem? Try Green Home Remedies</h3> 
<p> <br>
As much as we all dislike pests, most of us are leery of spraying 
chemicals around our homes as a means to get rid of them. Instead, here are 
some non-toxic, homemade remedies to send those invasive insects packing.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Before you start trying to get rid of any pest, though, take the obvious 
first step&mdash;remove any attractants that are keeping them around. This 
includes food residue, open food sources, and any standing or dripping 
water.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Roaches</strong></p> 
<p>Roaches are known as one of the most determinedly difficult insects to 
eliminate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Try spreading bay leaves around the house, or get a hold of some 
hedgeapples&mdash;the fruit of the Osage Orange tree&mdash;and leave one in 
every room in the house.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Catnip&mdash;for homes without cats&mdash;serves as an excellent roach 
repellant. To create an anti-roach solution, simmer catnip in water and then 
spray it around the house. Again, if you have a cat, it would be best not to 
use this technique!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Ants</strong></p> 
<p>For ant problems, try leaving bags of mint tea, cloves, or crushed mint 
leaves in high-activity areas. If you can track down the ants' point of entry 
into your home, create a &quot;fence&quot; of cinnamon, coffee grounds, or 
cayenne pepper. Sprinkling any of these in a small line around the entry will 
create a barrier the colony won't cross.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Flies</strong></p> 
<p>Leaving cloth scraps with a few drops of eucalyptus oil on them will keep 
flies away in problematic areas. Like ants, flies hate mint and cloves, so 
leaving some around the house will serve double duty in the fight on critters.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Keep a spray bottle of soapy water around for insect sightings too&mdash;a 
well-aimed shot or two will dispatch them handily.&nbsp;For information on 
repelling other species of insect pests, visit&nbsp;eartheasy.com</p>

<h2>January 28, 2010</h2> 
<h3>The Furnace Saga Continues: Making a Decision</h3> 
<p> As you know, our 15-year-old furnace recently developed a hole in the 
combustion chamber, which left us scrambling to answer this question: Do we 
repair it or replace it?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Luckily, the decision was easier than we thought. Most gas furnaces have a 
life expectancy of 15 to 20 years. For us, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to spend 
$600 when the furnace would most likely last another 3 to 5 years before we 
would need to replace it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Get a second opinion.</strong> Not sure what move is best for you? 
Talk to your heating and cooling contractor, who can assess the condition of 
your furnace and give you advice on how to proceed. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to 
ask their opinion, as they are motivated to keep you as a satisfied client.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider overall costs.</strong>&nbsp;Furnace repair and 
replacement is rarely a planned expense, but you may qualify for incentives. 
Knowing what you qualify for in rebates and tax credits is important when 
making your decision. It may make up the difference in being able to justify 
the more expensive yet more energy-efficient product. The result is the 
potential of reduced monthly energy costs. Just be aware that you will have to 
pay the purchase and installation costs upfront and wait for the rebate and tax 
credit.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Research incentives</strong>. Many utilities are encouraged to 
offer incentives to customers who purchase energy-efficient 
appliances.&nbsp;Start your search by visiting the&nbsp;Database of State 
Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency.&nbsp;Also contact your local 
utility or visit their website for additional information, or talk to your 
heating and cooling contractor.</p> 
<p>Some local utilities partner with lending institutions to provide 
competitive loan interest rates to purchase eligible equipment. These plans 
vary and may include a six-month same-as-cash option. Be aware that by 
committing to special finance assistance, you may be sacrificing rebate 
incentives. Call your local utility to find out what options are available and 
what restrictions apply.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Federal Government offers tax incentives for purchasing 
energy-efficient appliances. In 2008,Energy Star&nbsp;delivered cost and energy 
savings estimated at $19 billion. If you're considering the purchase of a major 
appliance or home upgrade, visit theirwebsite &nbsp;to determine what meets 
qualification for federal tax credit. Tax credit amounts vary, but can be as 
much as 30 percent of the cost up to $1,500.00. The current program expires 
December 31, 2010. You must be in an existing home to qualify and it must be 
your primary place of residence.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After exploring all our options, we decided to install a new system. Thanks 
to the rebate and tax incentives, we were able to select a 95 percent 
energy-efficient, variable-speed furnace and air conditioning system (it made 
financial sense to invest in and install a new air conditioner at the same 
time, because our old one was installed at the same time as the spent furnace). 
Our gas usage has noticeably dropped on our monthly utility bill, so we are 
satisfied with the choices we made.</p>

<h3>After the Holiday</h3> 
<p> All good times come to an end. Unfortunately, that includes the end of the 
holidays and enjoyment of your tree. Your tree has most likely started to have 
a brown tint to it and the fragrance isn't as noticeable as it was when you 
first set it up. You begin wondering if there might be more needles on the 
floor than on the tree.</p> 
<p>Well, it is time to take off the lights and decorations.</p> 
<p>But what to do with the tree?</p> 
<p>Many communities have disposal programs. Some offer curbside pick for a 
short period. Other communities have drop-off locations for disposal or 
recycling. Recycling programs will involve 'chipping' the trees for use as 
mulch or compost.</p> 
<p>If you just don't want to part with the tree, you can set it up in your 
yard as a combination feeder/shelter for birds and other wildlife. Eventually 
you are going to have to let go and dispose of it, though.</p> 
<p>Until later...<br>

can pose. Here are some of the Urban Myths that have been flying around:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Real Christmas Trees are cut down from forests.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>You save a tree by using a fake tree.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Real Christmas Trees aggravate allergies.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>It's better to use a fake tree because you can re-use it each year.
</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Christmas Trees are a fire safety hazard and frequently catch on 
fire.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Real trees cost too much.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Fake trees are fireproof.</strong></li>

also wasting precious money on needless products and hurting the environment in 
the process. But don't worry, there's an easy solution to this problem. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> </p>  Add these ingredients to your grocery list and replace those toxic 
chemicals and tree-hogging brushes and paper towels today:&nbsp; 
<ol> 
<li>baking soda</li> 
<li>white vinegar&nbsp;</li> 
<li>salt&nbsp;</li> 
<li>liquid soap&nbsp;</li> 
<li>spray bottles&nbsp;</li> 
<li>microfiber towels&nbsp;</li> 
<li>toilet bowl brush&nbsp;</li> 
<li>newspaper&nbsp;</li> 
<li>bucket&nbsp;</li> 
<li>broom and dustpan&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ol> Believe it or not, that's 
typically all you need to clean your bathroom or kitchen. With these

<h3>Green Around the House Challenge: Natural Home Air Fresheners</h3> 
<p> Any time the kitchen or living room reeked in my old apartment (my 
neighbors smoked in the hallway), I pulled the trigger&mdash;of bottled air 
freshener, that is. My trigger-happy habit lasted until I readthis <em>Time</em>
 magazine article. As it turns out, purchased air fresheners contain unhealthy 
ingredients that can cause more harm than good. Luckily, it's possible to fight 
even the nastiest of odors with one of these natural remedies.</p> 
<p><strong>Fresh air</strong> <br>
 When I go a little heavy on the garlic 
while whipping up dinner, I open up my patio doors and let soft breezes air 
things out. After all, what could be easier than that?</p> 
<p><strong>Fresh flowers</strong> <br>
 Plop a bunch of your favorite posies 
in a vase and let their sweet fragrance waft through the room. Bonus: You'll 
get a pretty shot of color too.</p> 
<p><strong>Newspaper</strong><br>
 Sweaty sneakers and musty suitcases don't 
stand a chance if you stuff them with wads of moisture- and odor-absorbing 
newspaper.</p> 
<p>Vanilla extract<br>
 If you've got a nasty stench coming from your 
microwave, get rid of it by pouring vanilla extract in a bowl and microwaving 
it for one minute. To eliminate fridge odors, soak a few cotton balls with 
vanilla extract.</p> 
<p><strong>Coffee grounds</strong><br>
 Lessen the unpleasantness of a freezer 
failure by leaving a few bowls of coffee grounds in the freezer 
overnight&mdash;it'll put spoiled food smells in their place. (According tothis 
blog post, mixing a few grounds into hand soap can eliminate nasty food odors 
that reside on your hands. Sweet!)</p> 
<p><strong>Citrus peels</strong><br>
 Whenever my garbage disposal smells 
funny, I grind leftover lemon or orange peels because it leaves behind a fresh, 
fruity scent.</p> 
<p><strong>Essential plant oils</strong><br>
 Dab a few drops of clove, 
peppermint, or eucalyptus oil on a cool light bulb. When you turn the light on, 
the heat infuses the room with fresh fragrance. Learn how you can make your own 
essential oil-based air fresheners here.</p> 
<p><strong>Baking soda</strong><br>
 The last time I had a mystery smell 
coming from my dishwasher (after it had been emptied, mind you), I ran a load 
with 1 cup of baking soda and was greeted with a fresher scent when I opened 
the door. Baking soda also works wonders if Fido has a little accident on your 
carpet. Sprinkle a little on your carpet, let it sit overnight to absorb odors, 
and sweep up as much as possible before vacuuming the rest. Also use it to stop 
smells in the fridge, trash can, and closet.</p>

article.</p>

<h3>Green Around the House Challenge: Green Your Cooking Process</h3> 
<p>The next time you're about to whip up dinner for friends and family, 
reconsider your cooking methods. </p> <br>
 According to this Mother Earth News 
article, the average family cooks 1.5 meals a day, and preparing those meals 
uses 30 minutes of energy. Continue that trend for a year, and you've spent 
$150 or more to serve up tasty meals&mdash;and that figure doesn't include the 
cost of food! That's why this week's Green Around the House Challenge is 
devoted to energy-efficient cooking ideas. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Get rid of 
grime.</strong> I admit it&mdash;I'm messy when I prepare meals and desserts. 
Think lots of olive oil splattered on my stovetop and butter splotches in my 
microwave. But I always clean up after myself. Here's why: Grime and 
spills&mdash;whether inside your microwave or on your stove's burner 
pans&mdash;absorb heat and reduce energy efficiency. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Size up cookware.</strong> Match pots and pans to the heating element or you'll 
waste energy by eating empty space. Case in point: using a 6-inch pot on an 
8-inch burner squanders more than 40 percent of the burner's heat. Yikes! 
Another consideration: Use a pan with a slightly concave bottom that rests 
evenly on the burner, because the bottom will flatten out as the metal expands 
from increased heat. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient 
Economy, boiling water for pasta could use 50 percent more energy on a warped 
pan than on a flat-bottom pan. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Pick the right materials.
</strong> Whipping up something on the stovetop? Reach for a cast iron pan or 
copper pan&mdash;the former retains heat better, the latter cooks faster. If 
you're popping a dish in the oven, use glass or ceramic pans, which reduce 
cooking temperatures by 25 degrees Fahrenheit with no extra time needed. Who 
knew? <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rethink cooking methods.</strong> If you're 
preparing a small- or medium-size meal, pop it in the microwave rather than in 
the oven. Microwave ovens can slash energy use by two-thirds compared to a 
conventional oven. And they generate a lot less heat&mdash;a definite plus 
during these remaining summer days. Another energy-efficient cooking option? 
Pressure cooking. It reduces stovetop energy use by 50 to 75 percent. If you 
hand-wash dishes, fill your sink to wash dishes rather than letting water run. 
Using the dishwasher? Scrape food off dishes without pre-rinsing and fully load 
the racks. <br>
<br>
<br>
There are oodles of other ways to green your cooking 
process&mdash;just check outthis Chow article for further inspiration. Need to 
stock up on eco-friendly dishware too? Get the scoop&nbsp;here. <br>

<h3>Cool Your House Naturally</h3> 
<p>In the dog days of summer, air conditioning bills can go through the roof. 
And heating and cooling units can take a serious toll on the environment; the 
U.S. Department of Energy estimates that such units emit a half billion tons of 
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. Fortunately, there are several 
eco-friendly ways to combat the sweltering sun without shelling out for AC. 
Follow these simple steps and you'll have it made in the shade.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Plant a Tree<br>
 It's a long-term project, but a full-grown tree can be a 
great air conditioner. When planting trees, consider which direction your yard 
faces. If it faces south, opt for deciduous trees. Their wide and thick 
canopies are perfect for shading your house in the summertime, and because they 
lose their leaves when the temperature drops, the sun can still warm your home 
in the wintertime. Evergreen trees, which maintain their foliage year round, 
are recommended for north-facing yards to break cold winter winds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When planting your tree, remember to give it room to grow, as a little 
sapling can turn into a giant. Plant your deciduous tree 10 to 20 feet away 
from your house, so when it reaches mature height, it'll provide a large and 
effective swath of shade. Plant your evergreens in a row, about 15 feet apart. 
Because they provide wind protection for up to 20 times their height, you can 
plant them a greater distance from your house.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Elegant Trellises<br>
 Trellises not only serve as attractive and elegant 
additions to your outdoor aesthetic; they also provide great shade. While trees 
may take years to grow, trellises&mdash;and the deciduous vines you plant 
around them&mdash;can get the job done in relatively no time at all. Grape and 
wisteria vines grow like wildfire and shed their leaves in the winter to allow 
the sun's heat to warm your home. Here's a greatstep-by-step guide on how to 
build your own trellises.</p> 
<p>Cool Awnings<br>
The most important feature of an awning is its drop. The 
drop is the distance between the top of the awning and the base of the window. 
(The higher the drop, the more shade an awning will provide.) A drop of 60 
percent or more is suggested for windows that are frequently exposed to sun. 
These sun-shielding awnings can save energy by dropping indoor temperatures by 
as much as 15 degrees fahrenheit. Check outcheapawnings.com to find an awning 
that matches your home's style.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Glass Glazing</strong><br>
 Windows on the east and west side of 
home naturally let in a lot of sunlight, which can raise indoor temperatures. 
However, window manufacturers offer heat-reflective films and coatings for 
windows that still allow natural light inside while keeping your home cool. As 
a bonus, these films can retain up to 55 percent of your home's heat during the 
wintertime.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Summertime Party Recycling </h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Nothing says summer quite like a backyard BBQ, but hosting one can be an 
eco-friendly hassle. Invites, plates, food, and garbage can give a little party 
a big ecological footprint. Fortunately, you have a variety of ways to recycle 
after your party and make your summer shindig a green affair.&nbsp;</p> Recycle 
Tableware <br>
 The most eco-conscious way to set your table is to use your own 
dishware and wash it yourself afterward. Not every host has time to deal with 
that kind of clean-up headache, however, so I suggest you use eco-friendly 
tableware instead.Bare by Solo is a brand of plates and cups made from bamboo 
and sugarcane that are compostable and recyclable. I also recommendBambu 
tableware made exclusively from bamboo plants.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Green 
Decorating&nbsp; <br>
 Forget buying streamers and balloons for your next 
party. They cost money and get thrown in the trash as soon as the last guest 
waves goodbye. Use recycled materials to make cool and unusual decorations 
instead. Check out the neat ideas Fun In the Making is offering up. Use an old 
sweater to make pennant swags or fashion quirky koala centerpieces out aluminum 
cans.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Eco-Options for Your Food Scraps <br>
 After your backyard 
bonanza has wrapped up, odds are you'll have leftovers. If there's too much 
left for you and your family to eat, give some away to guests. And if you have 
loads of nonperishables hanging around, donate them to your local food bank. If 
those aren't options, turn to composting. A simple backyard compost bin helps 
cut down both on the negative environmental impact of landfills and your own 
garbage disposal bill. Check outthis previous post for some composting dos and 
don'ts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Encourage Recycling <br>
 Leave clearly marked bags and 
bins in plain sight to give your guests somewhere to deposit cans and bottles. 
Grocery bags make easy and low-impact recycling bins. Have fun making the 
receptacles by turning it into a thrifty art project. See which member of your 
family can create the most colorful creation. Afterward, wheel your recycling 
to the curb for pick-up, or if you live in a state where bottles and cans are 
redeemable for cash, take them to a local supermarket or recycling center to 
make back some of your money.&nbsp; <br>

help you entertain eco-friendly style, check outour tips for throwing a green 
party.&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Clean Your Dryer Ducts</h3> 
<p> Go green, save money, and prevent fires in one fell swoop by vacuuming out 
your dryer ducts at least twice a year. Clogged dryer ducts reduce airflow, 
causing your clothes to take longer to dry, gobbling energy, and raising the 
temperature inside your dryer. But that&rsquo;s not the worst of 
it&mdash;lint-filled ducts can also cause fires. In 1998, theU.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission estimated that clothes dryers were associated with 
15,600 fires, 20 deaths, and 370 injuries.</p> 
<p>Keep your family safe and go green by vacuuming your dryer ducts regularly. 
Start with the lint trap inside your dyer. Using a wet/dry vacuum with a hose, 
suck out any visible lint inside the trap. Then disconnect the duct from behind 
the dryer. Insert the vacuum&rsquo;s wand into the hose and remove as much lint 
as possible.</p> 
<p>While you&rsquo;re cleaning your dryer, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to 
inspect the exhaust hood on the exterior of your home. To make sure everything 
is working properly, inspect it while you have clothes in the dryer. The flaps 
should be moving smoothly, without any restrictions.</p> 
<p>Spot a problem? Have a qualified service technician come take a look at it. 
Or for a more thorough inspection, have the technician clean the dryer ducts

<h3>Be a Clean, Green Dishwashing Machine</h3> 
<p> Ready for your next Green Around the House Challenge? You betcha! </p> 
<p>For this one, you&rsquo;ll need to head to the kitchen and get ready to 
tackle what may be your least favorite chore: dishwashing. With these smart 
techniques, you&rsquo;ll save water and energy, which in turn save you money. 
And that can make even the most unpleasant chore a little more bearable. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>No matter if your dishwasher is a human being or a machine, we&rsquo;ve got 
tips to make dishwashing more efficient. But you should know, dishwashers are 
nearly always more efficient than you, so if possible use the machine. Arecent 
study by the University of Bonn in Germany&nbsp; found that dishwashers use 
half the energy, one-sixth the water, and less soap than hand-washing. (I 
won&rsquo;t hold it against you if your only dishwasher is yourself, though. 
After all, I&rsquo;m in the same boat.)</p> 
<p>Hand-washing: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Employ the two-tub method. Use one section of your sink to soak your 
dishes and the other to rinse your dishes. This will cut down on the amount of 
running water.</li> 
<li>Use a green dishwashing liquid. My favorites: Mrs. Meyer&rsquo;s Dish Soap 
($3.99 for a 16-ounce container) andMethod&rsquo;s Dish Soap ($4 for a 25-ounce 
container).</li> 
<li>Use your pots and pans economically. Why use two pots to make spaghetti 
(one for the noodles and one for the sauce) when you can get away with one? 
Simply pour the sauce over the hot noodles to warm it up. You&rsquo;ll not only 
save energy and water, but you&rsquo;ll also save time.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p>Using a dishwasher: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Run your dishwasher only when full. It uses the same amount of water and 
energy no matter if it&rsquo;s half or completely full. Milk it for all 
it&rsquo;s worth by stuffing it with dishes before flipping the switch. &nbsp;
</li> 
<li>Avoid using the heat-dry, rinse-hold, and pre-rinse settings, which all 
scarf energy and water. Instead, use the energy-saving cycle and let your 
dishes air-dry. (Your dishwasher will consume 15 to 50 percent less energy.)
</li> 
<li>If your dishwasher was manufactured before 1994, ENERGY STAR&reg; 
recommends replacing it with an ENERGY STAR&reg; model. You&rsquo;ll save more 
than $30 a year in energy costs. Need help choosing a model? Check out our
Dishwasher Buying Guide. </li> </ul>

<h3>Natural Bug Repellents for You and Your Home</h3> 
<p> Mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and chiggers all know how to put a pesky bite in 
your summer fun.</p> 
<p>And while DEET, the active ingredient in most chemical bug repellents, is 
considered safe in small doses, overexposure can result in skin irritation, 
headaches, nausea, and neurological damage. Learn more on theGreen Guide. So 
unless you&rsquo;re planning a trip to a mosquito- or tick-infested area, why 
not just go the natural route for keeping bugs at bay?</p> 
<p>In honor of all the baseball games, picnics, barbecues, hikes, gardening, 
and other outdoor activities you&rsquo;ll want enjoy this summer sans bug 
bites, I bring you your next Green Around the House Challenge: repelling bugs 
naturally. It&rsquo;s easy&mdash;just follow these steps.</p> 
<p><strong> Dress for bug-free success.</strong> Wear clothing that limits 
skin exposure, such as long-sleeve shirts tucked into pants. Skip anything 
dark-colored or bold-patterned, which attracts mosquitoes. (Ticks are much 
easier to spot against light or white clothing, anyway.) Before stepping 
outdoors, pull on boots or other close-toed shoes instead of sandals, 
especially if you&rsquo;re in a particularly mosquito-heavy area. Also don a 
wide-brimmed hat and avoid applying heavily scented perfumes, colognes, and 
lotions.</p> 
<p><strong> Plant with pests in mind.</strong> Your beloved garden might have 
more bug-repelling power than you think, depending on what&rsquo;s growing. 
Rosemary, basil, catnip, lemon balm, and rose geraniums are all smart picks for 
warding off insects, according to this<em>Mother Earth News</em> story. To use 
any of these plants to your advantage, crush their leaves to release their 
scents. Then rub the essential oil on your skin.<br>
While you&rsquo;re at it, 
also check out thislist of herbs that repel insects (and animals too) from 
Dearborn Farms.</p> 
<p><strong> Eliminate standing water.</strong> Mosquitoes breed in standing 
water&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot before you&rsquo;ve got a bug 
problem. Just one mosquito can lay 300 eggs in one capful of water, according 
to the National Park Service. Your best line of defense? Regularly check and 
drain birdbaths, wading pools, gutters, birdbaths, flowerpots, and any other 
spot where water can collect after a rain shower. Also repair leaky outdoor 
pipes and faucets, and get rid of any unnecessary open containers that collect 
water. Score more tipshere for eliminating standing water.</p> 
<p><strong> Clean up mealtime.</strong> Bugs love feasting at picnics just as 
much as you. So if you&rsquo;re dining outdoors, keep food wrapped up and 
stored until you&rsquo;re ready to dig in. When you&rsquo;re done, promptly 
pack the remainders back up. Get more bug-free picnic tips from this<em>Do It 
Yourself</em> article. When eating indoors, quickly clean up bug-attracting 
crumbs and sticky spots, and cover all food containers.</p> 
<p>For easy ideas on keeping common household bugs such as ants, fleas, and 
cockroaches at bay naturally, hop on over to this Eartheasyarticle. Trust us, 
you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>

<h3>6 Easy Steps to Improve Indoor Air Quality </h3> 
<p> Here&rsquo;s your next Green Around the House Challenge&mdash;and it may 
be your simplest yet.</p> 
<p>Did you know the air quality in your apartment or home can be five times 
worse than the air outside? It&rsquo;s true! Inadequate ventilation, high 
humidity, and many household products are jeopardizing the air you breathe, and 
an increased number of indoor air pollutants can cause eye, throat, and nose 
irritations, as well as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue. They may 
even cause respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer.</p> 
<p>With all that looming over your head&mdash;and filling your 
lungs&mdash;it&rsquo;s more important than ever to whip your air into shape, 
and that&rsquo;s an easy, breezy thing to do. Follow these steps.</p> 
<p> 1. Open the windows. The more outdoor air you bring inside, the better. 
Whenever possible, open as many windows as you can. (In the wintertime, try 
opening a window or two just slightly when you know you&rsquo;ll be away for a 
short amount of time. It may be a little chilly when you get back, but 
you&rsquo;ll breathe much easier.)<br>
To make sure that clean air is 
circulated, turn on ceiling fans or strategically position oscillating fans 
around your house. If possible, switch on the attic fan and keep doors open to 
allow the air to move freely about your home.</p> 
<p>2. Invest in houseplants. Placing one plant approximately every 10 square 
yards can do wonders for your air quality. Try peace lilies, bamboo palms, 
English ivy, mums, and gerbera daisies, which can remove dangerous toxins like 
formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and benzene.</p> 
<p>3. Take off your shoes. Store your shoes in your entryway&mdash;or better 
yet, the garage&mdash;to avoid tracking mud and dirt through your home. It may 
take a bit of time to get used to, but the change is well worth it. Plus, 
you&rsquo;ll save time sweeping and vacuuming each week.</p> 
<p>4. Use green cleaning products. Traditional cleaning supplies are filled 
with toxic chemicals that leach into your air and eventually your lungs, so take
our suggestions and clean with nontoxic products instead. </p> 
<p>5. Vacuum and dust often. Sweep up all that dirt, hair, and other debris 
scattered on your floors at least once a week&mdash;more often if you have 
pets. And consider purchasing a vacuum with a HEPA filter, which sucks up even 
more airborne particles.</p> 
<p> 6. Purchase an air purifier. An air purifier can help eliminate 
second-hand tobacco smoke, animal dander, pollen, and mold and mildew, but 
before you lug one home, do your research. Check its Clean Air Delivery Rate 
(CADR), a number based on the cubic feet of air purified in one minute. Compare 
the square footage of your room to the purifier&rsquo;s CADR. In general, 
you&rsquo;ll need a purifier with a CADR that&rsquo;s three-fourths as big as 
your square footage.Lowe&rsquo;s can help you do the math. </p> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re finished, take a deep breath and appreciate that clean 
air. And don&rsquo;t forget to share with us what other steps you&rsquo;re 
taking to improve your indoor air quality.</p>

<h3>Green Your Outdoor Power Equipment</h3> 
<p> For today&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge, we&rsquo;re headed 
outside.</p> 
<p>Odds are, if you do much yard work, you rely on power equipment to get the 
job done. Many homeowners own gas-powered lawn mowers, trimmers, blowers, and 
more. As handy as these tools might be, they&rsquo;re pretty darn hazardous to 
your health&mdash;not to mention the environment.</p> 
<p>According to the EPA, emissions from lawn mowers, chain saws, leaf vacuums, 
and other outdoor power equipment are a considerable source of pollution. They 
emit high levels of carbon monoxides, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, which 
can impair lung function, inhibit plant growth, and more. In fact, according to 
the EPA, just one gas-powered lawn mower releases 11 times the air pollution of 
a new car for each hour it&rsquo;s operated. Yikes.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, switching to more environmentally friendly outdoor tools is 
easier than you might think. Propane or electric trimmers and blowers are a 
more environmentally friendly solution. And a number oflawn mower options
&mdash;including electric and reel mowers&mdash;make cutting the grass less 
harmful. While you&rsquo;re researching online, learn more about why leaf 
blowers are bad and get the scoop on four alternatives fromThe Daily Green.</p> 
<p>In some areas, you may even be able to exchange your gas-powered lawn mower 
for an electric one. Get the scoop on exchange programs fromConsumer Reports. 
</p> 
<p>And stay tuned: You may have more incentive to switch soon if the Greener 
Gardens bill passes. It would offer a federal tax credit of 25 percent off the 
price up to $1,000 of an electric, hybrid, or alternative-energy mower and 
other lawn gear.</p> 
<p>Of course, you could say sayonara to emissions altogether (aside from those 
produced in the production and transport of your new tools) by opting for good 
old elbow grease. In addition to a push mower, put your rakes and handheld 
hedge trimmers into service toburn calories and get your yard looking great in 
no time. Trust me, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<h3>What We&rsquo;re Loving This Week: VivaTerra Misprint Collection</h3> 
<p>I&rsquo;m moving to a new apartment soon and am looking for ways to spice 
up the bland white walls. (Sadly, there&rsquo;s a no-painting policy at this 
apartment. But I feel the generous square footage more than makes up for that.) 
So imagine my happiness when I stumbled upon the eclecticMisprint collection 
from VivaTerra.</p> 
<p>Every item pops with color and distinct personality. Perhaps best of all, 
everything is made from misprinted or smudged sheet metal, such as soup, soda, 
and juice cans that would otherwise be sent to the landfill because of their 
initial imperfections. Learn more about the inspiration behind the Misprint 
collectionhere. </p> 
<p> There&rsquo;s something for everyone in this line. If you&rsquo;re an avid 
magazine reader like me, there&rsquo;s theMisprint Magazine Rack ($89) that 
perfectly cozies up to any wall and stores a ton of glossies. Or if you want to 
brighten up your entryway and corral clutter at the same time, consider the
Misprint Hooks in &ldquo;Go&rdquo; ($29) and &ldquo;Green&rdquo; ($42). Enjoy 
outdoor living? Then you need Misprint Hanging Lanterns ($69) to brighten up 
your deck or patio on warm summer nights. Heck, you can even buy aMisprint 
Waste Can ($35). </p> 
<p>My personal favorite? The Misprint Kitchen Messages that spell out 
&ldquo;Eat &amp; Drink&rdquo; ($98 for the complete set). I think these 
messages would be a festive, appropriate addition to my new kitchen.<br>
<br>

</p> 
<p><br>
Within the Misprint collection, you&rsquo;ll also find messages for 
your potting shed and bedroom, too. And the collection appears to be growing, 
as new items are regularly added. I&rsquo;m excited to see what&rsquo;s next!
</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite item in this line?</p>

<h3>Make a Rain Barrel</h3> 
<p> Man oh man do I have a weekend project for you.</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, harvesting rainwater at home is a great way 
to save money, save water, and keep your yard or garden looking great.</p> 
<p>And although you can buy some pretty nice-looking rain catchers from 
Gardener&rsquo;s Supply, you can also make your own&mdash;even if you&rsquo;re 
not all that handy.</p> 
<p>Trust me. If I can do it, you can do it. And I did, thanks to a build your 
own rain barrel workshop last summer at theEcology Action Center in 
Bloomington, IL.</p> 
<p>For this week&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge, I&rsquo;m giving 
you the scoop on how I built the rain barrel so you can too, after hunting down 
a food-grade plastic barrel and a few other supplies at your local hardware 
store.</p> 
<p>Supplies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>One food-grade 55-gallon plastic barrel</li> 
<li>&frac12;-inch female sillcock (spigot)</li> 
<li>Two #15 O-rings (little black rubber rings)</li> 
<li>&frac34;-inch flat washer (we used grade 8)</li> 
<li>&frac12;-inch brass pipe nipple (this is the threaded pipe that passes 
through the barrel and connects to the spigot/sillcock)</li> 
<li>&frac12;-inch brass lock nut</li> 
<li>Downspout adaptor</li> 
<li>&frac34;-inch pan head screws</li> 
<li>Hacksaw or jigsaw or sabresaw or Sawz-All</li> 
<li>4-inch hole saw</li> 
<li>7/8-inch hole saw</li> 
<li>1&frac34;-inch hole saw</li> 
<li>Drill</li> </ul> 
<p>Steps:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Use the 4-inch hole saw to cut a hole in the top 
of the barrel for your downspout.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Use a 7/8-inch hole saw 
to cut a hole 3 inches up from the bottom of the barrel for your 
spigot/sillcock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Also use the 7/8-inch hole saw to cut a 
hole about 2 to 3 inches from the top of the barrel. This will be at the narrow 
part of the barrel and is where you will start to cut off the top of the barrel 
with your saw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Use the hacksaw or jigsaw or sabresaw 
to remove the top of the barrel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Wipe any residual oil or 
liquid from the barrel. (We used newspapers to absorb the liquid. It worked 
well but it can get incredibly messy.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Use the 1 
&frac34;-inch hole saw to cut a hole about 2 inches below the open top of the 
barrel. This will be for the overflow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Screw the pipe 
nipple into the spigot/sillcock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Place an O-ring on the 
pipe nipple, as close to the sillcock as possible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Push the 
pipe nipple through the outside of the barrel to the inside. The 
spigot/sillcock is now outside, with the pipe nipple inside.<br>
&nbsp; 10. 
Have someone hold the spigot outside while you place an O-ring on the pipe 
nipple inside the barrel.<br>
&nbsp; 11. Place the metal washer over the pipe 
nipple.<br>
&nbsp; 12. Thread the brass lock nut (or the steel conduit locknut) 
over the pipe nipple. Tighten it by hand as far as possible. Tighten another 
1.5 turns with a wrench to secure it.<br>
&nbsp; 13. Take the 4-inch plastic 
disc that you cut out of the top of the barrel and use a saw to cut it in 
fourths, like a piece of pie.<br>
&nbsp; 14. Screw the pieces to the sides of 
the barrel near the top, with at least 1 inch protruding above the barrel.<br>

&nbsp; 15. Place the lid of the barrel back on the barrel. The little plastic 
pieces will keep it centered. The lid usually only fits one way; line that up 
by referring to the hole you drilled near the top of the barrel when you cut 
off the top.</p> 
<p> After your rain barrel is complete, all you have to do is position it near 
your downspout. It&rsquo;s a good idea to stack some bricks beneath the barrel 
so it&rsquo;s raised off the ground&mdash;this makes it easier to get to the 
spigot when it's time to hook up the hose or fill up your watering can.</p> 
<p>Depending on where you position your rain barrel, overflow may be a 
concern. If you don&rsquo;t want all that excess water shooting out the 
overflow hole you drilled in your barrel, you can place the male connector end 
of a sump pump hose, pointing outward, into the overflow hole at the top of the 
barrel. A trap adaptor will secure it to the inside of the barrel. The sump 
pump hose will connect to the outside of the barrel.</p> 
<p>Another option is to purchase a downspout diverter, like this one from 
Garden Water Saver. That&rsquo;s what I did, only the gutter wasn&rsquo;t very 
cooperative and, to be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s a very 
reliable setup. So I may be going back and drilling that overflow hole, then 
sticking with the original downspout adaptor after all. We&rsquo;ll 
see&mdash;the rain we&rsquo;re expecting this weekend will be the test.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more step-by-step info on making a rain barrel, 
watch Sherry &amp; John in action over atThis Young House as they build their 
own. Or search online&mdash;there are plenty of other ways creative folks have 
made their own rain barrels.</p>

<h3>Happy Earth Day!</h3> 
<p> Exactly 39 years ago today, Gaylord Nelson, a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, 
established the first nationwide environmental protest. For the first time 
ever, 20 million people stood in unison against oil spills, toxic factories, 
pesticides, wildlife extinction and much more. Today, hundreds of millions of 
people and more than 180 countries participate in the Earth Day celebration.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s organizing a neighborhood cleanup, mailing letters to 
our congressmen and women, or riding a bike to work, we here at The Home 
Know-It-All can&rsquo;t wait to do our part this year! Want to know how you can 
get involved? TheEarth Day Network can point you in the right direction. </p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to remember, however, that environmental activism 
isn&rsquo;t something that can happen once a year. Go green year-round by 
following some of ourgreen living suggestions and choosing the right products. 
Here&rsquo;s a list of our favorite eco-friendly companies:</p> 
<p>Trex: This manufacturer of composite deck, railing, and fencing materials 
is one of the nation&rsquo;s largest users of recycled grocery bags. 
You&rsquo;d never guess by looking at the beautiful decking that it&rsquo;s 
made from plastic sacks.</p> 
<p>Simmons Natural Care by Danny Seo: Affordable and eco-friendly, these 
mattresses seem too good to be true. But they&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re made 
from natural latex, soy-enhanced foam, and sustainably harvested wood&mdash;and 
they only cost between $2,500 and $4,500. (That&rsquo;s almost half the price 
of other eco-friendly mattresses!)</p> 
<p>The Body Shop: Since it opened its doors in 1976, this cosmetic company has 
sold only ethical, eco-sensitive beauty products. By providing suppliers in 
developing countries a decent wage and promoting social and environmental 
integrity in all dealings, The Body Shop is not only 
eco-friendly&mdash;it&rsquo;s also socially friendly.</p> 
<p>Kohl&rsquo;s: This department store buys 236 million kilowatt-hours of 
green power each year, making it the second-largest retail purchaser of green 
power in the country. Kohl&rsquo;s has also recently announced a solar 
initiative to power many of its stores by the sun.</p> 
<p>Have a good one!</p>

<h3>Going for Gray Water</h3> 
<p> The average American household consumes 90 gallons of fresh drinking water 
each day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. And a good 
portion of that water goes to waste.</p> 
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to, which is why today&rsquo;s Green Around the 
House Challenge is getting serious about conserving&mdash;and 
reusing&mdash;water. Specifically, it&rsquo;s all about gray water.</p> 
<p>Water you use at home for dishwashing, showering, washing hands, and 
laundry&mdash;called gray water&mdash;comprises 50 to 80 percent of residential 
water waste, according toGraywater Central. But gray water doesn&rsquo;t have 
to go to waste. Instead, it can be used to water your yard.</p> 
<p>A gray water system includes a surge tank into which all gray water drains, 
a filter to remove particles that might clog the system, and irrigation pipes 
or lines that move the gray water from the house to your plants. You can learn 
more about gray water basics from this helpful<em>Natural Home</em> article.</p>
<p>Yet you don&rsquo;t have to install a complex system to reuse water. Simply 
leave a bowl in the sink or a pail in the shower to catch water for giving 
thirsty plants a drink. Or collect and reuse water from your dehumidifer. 
Another common method, according to theColorado State University Extension is 
to drain your washing machine water directly onto outside vegetation (although, 
admittedly, this method is illegal in most states).</p> 
<p>Gray water systems, which can capture and recycle as much as half of your 
daily household water, are growing increasingly common in newly built homes and 
are being retrofit into many existing residences. Yet many areas regulate the 
use of gray water&mdash;and some even ban it. So before you spend the cash on a 
gray water system, be sure to check state and local gray water laws and 
policies. If gray water systems aren&rsquo;t allowed in your area, perhaps you 
can start a movement to change policymakers&rsquo; minds.</p> 
<p>Wondering whether it&rsquo;s good to use &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; water on your 
yard? TheUMass Extension offers some handy guidelines for safely using gray 
water. Some of their pointers include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use the right soaps. Although soap and detergent is biodegradable, it can 
cause problems if you use gray water for a long time (because excessive amounts 
of sodium salts, present in many cleaning agents, can damage soil and plants). 
In particular, avoid detergents with &ldquo;softening power,&rdquo; phosphates, 
boron, and chlorine.</li> 
<li>Know how much gray water your yard can handle. A square foot of 
well-drained, loamy soil can soak up about a half gallon of gray water per week.
</li> 
<li>Opt for shower and bathtub water first. Next up, use water from the 
bathroom sink, utility sink, washing machine, kitchen sink, and dishwasher in 
that order. UMass Extension actually recommends not using kitchen sink or 
dishwasher water because it may contain higher levels of grease, food 
particles, and other materials. And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t recycle water 
from a washing machine used to wash baby diapers or water from the toilet.</li> 
<li>Stick with fresh water for vegetable gardens. The gray water is great for 
ornamental plants and shrubs, but you should use fresh water for the food 
you&rsquo;ll eventually eat.</li> 
<li>Apply gray water directly to the soil surface rather than splashing it 
around or pouring it all over plants.</li> 
<li>Rotate gray water and fresh water applications to avoid contaminant 
buildup.</li> 
<li>Use gray water only on established plants, not seedlings.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about watering plants the gray 
way, visit theGreywater Guerillas website or check out this article from <em>
Natural Home</em> magazine that covers the nuts and bolts of gray water use. 
</p> 
<p>Or if you really want to get serious, read <em>Create an Oasis with 
Greywater</em> or <em>The Builder&rsquo;s Greywater Guide</em>.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;d rather not pour used water on your plants at all but would 
still like to conserve, here&rsquo;s another use for your gray water: toilet 
flushing. It&rsquo;s easy with theAqus system, which captures water from the 
bathroom sink, filters and disinfects it, and sends it into the toilet for use 
when flushing. The savings are considerable: in a two-person household, using 
the Aqus can reduce metered water usage by 10 to 20 gallons a day, according to 
the manufacturer.</p>

<h3>Remodeling Recycling</h3> 
<p> You may find it hard to believe, but you can recycle almost everything 
that comes out of your home during a remodel. It&rsquo;s true! With the right 
planning and preparation, you can practically skip ordering a dumpster.&nbsp; 
(And that&rsquo;s a good thing! Currently 136 million tons of waste is 
transported to landfills from renovation projects a year.)</p> 
<p>Plastic, glass, cabinetry, batteries, doors, trim, sinks, tubs, and much 
more can all be recycled. Just think deconstruction, not demolition. That way 
you can keep everything in good working order. And before tearing things apart, 
try to arrange a new home for the item. Perhaps you can repurpose it back in 
your renovated space, but if not, check with the following companies to see if 
they&rsquo;ll accept your donations.<br>
<strong><br>
Habitat for Humanity.
</strong> In addition to providing housing for needy families, Habitat for 
Humanity also owns retail outlets calledHabitat Restores. The stores sell used 
and surplus building materials donated by supply stores, contractors, 
demolition crews, and individual homeowners. Call your local Restore to see if 
they&rsquo;ll take your used materials.<br>
<strong><br>
Gifts In Kind 
International.</strong> Gifts In Kind is the 12th largest charity in the United 
States, and it also will accept your product donations to redistribute to needy 
individuals. Click the &ldquo;Donate Products&rdquo; link to see how you can 
help.</p> 
<p><strong>Local Charities and Second-Hand Stores.</strong> These independent 
salvage yards are popping up all over the place, and because they don&rsquo;t 
operate to fill the needs of a certain consumer, they accept a wider variety of 
building materials. Check your phonebook to find one in your area.</p> 
<p>So what do you get out of this? Besides feeling the joy of diverting waste 
from landfills, you also help those less fortunate than yourself. On top of 
that, you receive a tax deduction equal to the price for which the items are 
sold. So be sure to keep your receipts!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information on recycling after a remodel, see what the 
Professional Remodeler has to say. </p>

<h3>Turn off the lights. Turn up the savings.</h3> 
<p> Want an easy, green project for your Wednesday afternoon? Replace your 
light switches with occupancy sensors! You&rsquo;ll save big bucks on your 
energy bill and decrease the number of light bulbs headed to the landfill. 
Plus, you&rsquo;ll never have to remember to turn off lights again.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An occupancy sensor is a device that automatically turns the light on when 
you walk into a room and off when you walk out. They&rsquo;re best suited for 
spaces used less often&mdash;like the garage, basement, or utility closet. And 
because they prevent you from accidentally leaving a light on for an extended 
period of time, many folks reduce the energy their lights consume by up to 90 
percent. Typical reductions range from 35 to 45 percent, according to the
California Energy Commission. </p> 
<p>What does all this mean for you? A dramatic decrease in your energy bill. 
And if that&rsquo;s not enough incentive for you to switch, installing 
occupancy sensors is as easy as pie. First, turn off the power and unscrew your 
current light switch from the wall. Then, detach the wires and reconnect them 
to your new sensor using wire nuts. Gently push the new switch into the wall 
box and attach it with mounting screws. Finally, screw in the outlet cover and 
switch the power back on.</p> 
<p>For more in-depth instructions and description of how occupancy sensors 
work, read this article fromElectronic Construction &amp; Maintenance magazine

<h3>Green Your Toilet</h3> 
<p>If your toilet has been around since before 1995, it probably uses as much 
as 3.5 gallons of water per flush. And if it happens to be a pre-1980 model? 
You&rsquo;re looking at 5 gallons headed down the pipes every time it&rsquo;s 
used. That&rsquo;s a lot of water, particularly since the National Energy 
Policy Act of 1992 mandated that toilets use no more than 1.6 gallons of water 
per flush&mdash;and some of today&rsquo;s models use considerably less than 
that.</p> 
<p>Although purchasing a low-flow toilet is probably the best way to reduce 
your toilet water use, you don&rsquo;t have to fork over the cash for a new one 
to save. Lucky you, today&rsquo;s<strong>Green Around the House Challenge
</strong> shows you how to cut back on the water use, waste, and pollution that 
originates from this bathroom staple.</p> 
<p><strong>Look for leaks.</strong> Americans use 5.8 billion gallons of water 
to flush their toilets every day &mdash; and that doesn&rsquo;t include how 
much water is wasted from leaky toilets. Although leaks often go unnoticed, 
figuring out whether your toilet leaks is pretty easy. Add a few drops of food 
coloring to the tank and avoid flushing. If color appears in the bowl within 15 
to 30 minutes, it&rsquo;s time to repair. (Common culprits: a faulty flapper or 
worn plunger ball.)</p> 
<p><strong>Displace water in the tank.</strong> This is an easy one. Simply 
rinse out a half-gallon juice jug, add a couple of inches or sand or pebbles to 
weigh the jug down, then fill the rest of the jug with water. Screw on the lid, 
flush the toilet, and place the jug in the tank. Displacing just that 
half-gallon of water with each flush can end up saving you more than 240 
gallons of water per month. (I just added a jug to one of our toilets this 
weekend and so far no one has even noticed!)</p> 
<p><strong>If it&rsquo;s yellow...</strong> Yes, I know. The rhyme &ldquo;If 
it&rsquo;s yellow let it mellow, if it&rsquo;s brown flush it down&rdquo; 
causes many people to cringe. But it&rsquo;s true! Not flushing when there are 
just liquids in the bowl saves gallons of water each day. (But if you 
don&rsquo;t want to do it, I won&rsquo;t tell.)</p> 
<p><strong>Use recycled toilet paper.</strong> Recycled toilet paper options 
are becoming increasingly available &mdash; and they do the job just as well as 
other types of TP. And swapping toilet paper brands is an easy change that 
yields big results: If every household in the United States replaced just one 
roll of virgin fiber toilet paper (500 sheets) with 100 percent recycled ones, 
we could save 423,900 trees, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council 
(NRDC). When shopping for TP, just be sure to verify the percentage of 
post-consumer waste (PCW) in the product. And, while you&rsquo;re at it, make 
certain the toilet paper was processed chlorine-free (PCF), which means it 
wasn&rsquo;t whitened with chlorine bleach (a nasty pollutant that ends up in 
water supplies). You can learn more about picking the right toilet paper fromA 
Shopper&rsquo;s Guide to Home Tissue Products by the NRDC.</p> 
<p><strong>Stop flushing prescriptions!</strong> If you&rsquo;ve heard that 
flushing old prescription drugs down the toilet is the best way to dispose of 
them, think again. Recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency surveys have 
found trace levels of more than 100 different pharmaceutical drugs in water 
samples, including drinking-water sources. Those traces harm streams, the fish 
that live in them &mdash; and, in high doses, even human health.</p> 
<p>Instead of tossing unused drugs, check with your local pharmacy to see if 
they have a take-back program. Or check for a hazardous-waste collection 
program in your area. And if you must use the trash? Follow the guidelines of 
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for proper disposal 
(available in thisdownloadable PDF).</p> <br>

<h3>Eco-Friendly Painting</h3> 
<p> You&rsquo;ve heard it here before: Painting is one of the easiest, most 
affordable ways to spruce up your home. Nothing says hello spring (or winter or 
fall or any season for that matter) like a fresh coat of paint on the walls, on 
a favorite piece of furniture, or even on a canvas hung on the wall.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why today&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge is all 
about greening your painting routine.</p> 
<p>The first and most important step to painting greener is to select low- or 
no-VOC paint. Lucky for you, I&rsquo;ve written on that very topic before. So 
all you have to do to understand why it&rsquo;s important to paint VOC-free 
(and where you can find paint sans VOCs) isread this post.</p> 
<p>But what about the tools you use? </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The greenest option is usually the reusable option. When it comes to 
protecting your floors and furniture, do you have any old sheets you 
aren&rsquo;t using anymore? Throw them down as drop cloths. Or buy a heavy-duty 
canvas drop cloth, which can be used over and over again. If you&rsquo;re 
looking for a temporary fix, check out Trimaco&rsquo;s Eco Drop biodegradable 
paint tarps, which are available for $3 at many Lowe&rsquo;s stores. Or try an 
all-purpose cotton drop sheet from Reaves, which is made from 90 percent 
post-consumer recycled content, is washable, and will decompose when you decide 
it&rsquo;s time to toss it. Or to avoid having so many drips in the first 
place, consider purchasing aDrip Catcher.</p> 
<p>Moving on to paint trays, you can&rsquo;t beat a quality, reusable metal 
paint tray. New models that are coated with Teflon make cleanup even 
easier&mdash;and they&rsquo;re a cinch to find at stores such as Ace Hardware. 
Another option: biodegradable disposable paint trays made from recycled pulp 
fiber fromBio Pulp Works, also available at Lowe&rsquo;s. </p> 
<p>When it comes to paint brushes or rollers, opt for quality, durable 
supplies that can be washed and reused. Or if disposable is a must, look for 
options made from recycled materials, such as the Worktools Whizz Green Brush 
with a renewable bamboo handle and the Whizz Green Roller made from recycled 
post-consumer waste. Then there&rsquo;s theEnvirobrush, which features 
disposable bristles that lock into a reusable (and recyclable!) plastic handle.
</p> 
<p>Once you have your supplies, hop on over to this post on painting basics to 
study up before you begin. And after the fact, check out ourpainting cleanup 
pointers to make life easier. Then sit back, relax, and enjoy your new color!

<h3>Track Your Energy Use</h3> 
<p> This week&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge is all about energy. 
And for good reason. The typical American family spends about $1,900 a year on 
home utility bills, according to theU.S. Department of Energy&mdash;and a good 
portion of that energy is needlessly wasted.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of easy steps you can take to reduce your energy use 
today, including greening yourwater heater (last week&rsquo;s challenge), 
replacing standard incandescent bulbs withCFLs, and<br>
getting rid of phantom 
loads.</p> 
<p>But one of the most important moves you can make is actually tracking how 
much energy your family uses. It&rsquo;s the first step to making meaningful 
changes in energy consumption, which leads to less reliance on fossil fuels, 
yes, but also reduced energy bills (and more money in your bank account). And 
it&rsquo;s effective: studies estimate that just knowing about your 
household&rsquo;s energy consumption can lead to a 5 to 15 percent reduction in 
your energy bill. Hooray for awareness!</p> 
<p>A number of gadgets make gauging your energy consumption easy. Some of my 
favorites include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Kill A Watt.</strong> To find out which small appliances consume 
the most energy, plug this device into a power outlet and then plug the 
appliance (or a small electronic item) into theKill A Watt. An LCD display on 
the meter shows electricity consumption so you can calculate how much energy 
each item uses per day, week, month, or year. (Hint: You can save 50 percent on 
the purchase of a Kill A Watt if you buy it now atAmazon.com!)</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Power Cost Monitor.</strong> Track your home&rsquo;s electricity 
use in real time with this easy-to-install digital monitor. An attachment 
placed on the face of your power meter reads the meter and sends info to a 
wireless display located inside your house. Once it&rsquo;s set up, try making 
an easy energy-saving move, then see how it affects the data on the display. 
Learn more (and order one)here.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong> The Energy Detective (TED).</strong> Yet another device for 
keeping an eye on your home&rsquo;s energy use,TED can help you save 10 to 20 
percent on your energy bill. Simply install a transmitter in your breaker box, 
plug the display unit into an electric outlet, and you&rsquo;re ready to get 
readings on current energy consumption in kilowatts, current energy costs, 
energy consumed (and how much it costs) this billing cycle, historical data for 
the past 13 months, and more. The transmitter is so sensitive that you&rsquo;ll 
see the jump in energy use simply by turning on a light or opening the 
refrigerator. Plus you can attach TED to your computer for real-time data 
logging, graphing, charting, and more using TED Footprints software.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Google PowerMeter.</strong> You already knew you could search the 
Internet, check your e-mail, and more with Google. But did you know Google can 
help you monitor your energy use too? It&rsquo;s true&mdash;almost. Google is 
working on thePowerMeter, which will receive information from utility smart 
meters and energy management devices to show you your electricity consumption 
in real-time (for free) right on your iGoogle homepage. It&rsquo;s still in 
prototype mode, but guaranteed I&rsquo;ll be trying it out the second it goes 
live.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Home Energy Audit.</strong> Performing your own home energy audit 
(or, better yet, hiring a professional to do one) can give you clues about 
where exactly you&rsquo;re losing energy around the house.</li> </ul> 
<p>What other tools do you find useful for monitoring home energy use? Leave a 
commenthere to share your ideas with your fellow The Home Know-It-All readers!

<h3>Green Your Water Heater </h3> 
<p> Here&rsquo;s a little factoid to convince you to participate in 
today&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge: Water heating accounts for up 
to 15.5 percent of the energy used in your home&mdash;second only to HVAC 
systems in regard to residential energy consumption, according to ENERGY 
STAR&reg;.</p> 
<p>Part of the reason is that although you probably use hot water infrequently 
(for hand-washing, bathing, and dish-washing), your water heater is always hard 
at work keeping water warm so it&rsquo;s ready for you on demand.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, slashing your water heater energy consumption is easier than 
you might think. Here are three moves you can do this weekend, plus info on 
water heater upgrades that will save you considerably in the long run.</p> 
<p><strong> Turn down the temp.</strong> This is the easiest green move on the 
list. Head to your water heater, figure out where the temperature setting is, 
and turn it down to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or 120 degrees. For every 10 degrees 
you reduce your water heater temperature, you can save 3 to 5 percent on energy 
costs according to the U.S. Department of Energy. (Bonus: Turning down the 
water heater to 120 degrees is a smart safety move that prevents scalding.)</p> 
<p><strong>Buy a blanket.</strong> Wrapping your water heater in an insulation 
blanket can reduce water heating energy consumption by 4 to 9 percent. Not sure 
if your water heater needs the extra insulation? Touch the tank. If it&rsquo;s 
warm to the touch, it&rsquo;s time to insulate. (It&rsquo;s also a good idea to 
check your owner&rsquo;s manual first, however, as some specifically state that 
the tank shouldn&rsquo;t be insulated.)</p> 
<p>You can purchase a pre-cut jacket or blanket for $10 to $20 from your local 
hardware or home improvement store. Some utilities sell them too&mdash;and may 
even install them for you. If you&rsquo;re tackling installation yourself 
(don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s a piece of cake), the U.S. Department of Energy 
provides ahandy guide that shows you how.</p> 
<p><strong> Insulate your pipes.</strong> While you&rsquo;re in insulation 
mode, why not take care of your water heater pipes too? It&rsquo;s an 
incredibly easy way to improve energy efficiency. All you do is measure the 
circumference of the intake and outtake pipes. Then head to the hardware store 
and buy insulation (usually $2 to $4 per strip), a utility knife, and acrylic 
or duct tape. According toGreenyour.com, the process is as easy as cutting the 
insulation to fit the length and diameter of your pipes, slipping the 
insulation onto the pipes, and securing the insulation every foot or so with 
tape. Pretty darn doable, eh?</p> 
<p><strong>Buy ENERGY STAR.</strong> If you&rsquo;re in the market for a new 
water heater this year, you&rsquo;re in luck. As of January 1, 2009, you can 
purchase ENERGY STAR&reg; water heaters. There are five different technologies 
that have earned the ENERGY STAR rating and, depending on which technology you 
choose, you&rsquo;ll reduce your heating bills anywhere from 7.5 to 55 percent. 
Here&rsquo;s a rundown on each, thanks to information from the U.S. Department 
of Energy.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>High-efficiency gas storage water heaters work much the same as standard 
gas storage water heaters but benefit from improved insulation, heat traps, and 
efficient burners.</li> 
<li>Gas condensing water heaters are similar to gas water heaters, but to 
increase efficiency heat from the combustion gases is transferred to the water 
instead of being vented outside.</li> 
<li>Whole-home gas tankless water heaters heat water similarly to standard gas 
water heaters. The big difference: they don&rsquo;t have a storage tank. That 
means that water is heated only when you need it&mdash;a big energy saver over 
standard water heaters that lose energy during standby operation.</li> 
<li>Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) technology uses liquid refrigerant to move 
heat from the surrounding air to the water in an enclosed tank rather than 
generating heat directly.</li> 
<li>Solar water heaters use the sun&rsquo;s thermal energy to heat water and 
can be used alone or with a backup conventional water heating system. Learn 
about the different types of solar water heatershere, then make sure the one 
you ultimately choose has an ENERGY STAR label to guarantee even more savings.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Happy energy saving!</p>

<h3>Greener TV Buying</h3> 
<p> I&rsquo;m the lucky owner of a brand new LCD TV. (Check it out here) And 
even though it&rsquo;s only a 32-inch, I&rsquo;m proud of it&mdash;not only 
because it saved me big bucks when I bought it but also because it&rsquo;ll 
save more moolah when it comes to my electricity bill.</p> 
<p>Sounds like the perfect Green Around the House Challenge for you if you ask 
me. Want to know why you should undertake it?</p> 
<p><strong>Bigger isn&rsquo;t always better.</strong> Your TV should be no 
bigger than 40 inches. Any bigger, it&rsquo;ll waste substantially more energy 
than a smaller size. Not to mention it takes more energy to produce.<br>

<strong><br>
LCD is the way to be.</strong> Both LCD and plasma TVs are made 
with icky nitrogen trifluoride, a chemical that contributes to global warming, 
and even though in a smaller size a plasma TV wastes only a sliver more energy 
than an LCD, the bigger you get the more energy a plasma wastes. LCD TVs, 
however, are available in smaller sizes, making them the lesser of the two 
evils and saving you up to $115 more per year to operate. But if you still have 
an old cathode ray tube hanging around, stick with it&mdash;it&rsquo;s the 
greenest of all TVs.<br>
<strong><br>
ENERGY STAR&reg; Approved.</strong> An 
ENERGY STAR &reg; TV uses 30 percent less energy than standard units. 
That&rsquo;s why I made sure my shiny new one came with the approval. You can 
find it on most types of units.</p> 
<p>Want more proof you should green your TV? Read what ENERGY STAR&reg; and 
TreeHugger have to say. </p> 
<p>Now go forth and conquer yet another Green Around the House Challenge. And 
when you get that TV, we can tell youhow to mount it. </p>

Until tomorrow, <br>

<h3>Flea Market Finds</h3> 
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with blogs like Daily Danny and 
Design*Sponge that teach you how to recreate a flea market find into a stunning 
interior-decorating masterpiece. Just check out some ofthese and you&rsquo;ll 
be riproaring and ready to head to the flea market too.</p> 
<p>Problem is when I&rsquo;m at the thrift store, consignment shop, or what 
have you, I don&rsquo;t see these &ldquo;finds.&rdquo; Sure, I see them, but I 
must not really see them, or I&rsquo;d see the potential. You see?</p> 
<p>The solution: I&rsquo;ve put together a guideline that&rsquo;ll help me 
spot these makeovers-waiting-to-happen. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come up 
with:</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Find your shop.</strong> From garage sales to estate sales to 
even rental furniture outlets, there are lots of places to purchase pre-owned 
merchandise. But it&rsquo;s not likely that all of these locations will suit 
your fancy. For some, the mere thought of the crowd and rows and rows of 
vendors at a flea market is enough to make them shudder. A rental furniture 
outlet&rsquo;s quiet warehouse of no longer rentable furniture might make more 
sense. And if you hate the thought of bargaining at an estate sale, perhaps an 
online auction is more up your alley.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Educate yourself.</strong> If you&rsquo;re in the market for a 
new dining room table, consult furniture stores to see what a new version goes 
for, and then check outCraigslist, eBay, or GoAntiques to learn the going-rate 
of used pieces and see what&rsquo;s available. (Online shops are often a great 
place to start not only because they&rsquo;re informative but also because 
listings are typically posted by the owner, cutting out the middleman and 
lowering the price.)</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Dress Appropriately.</strong> In this case, think jeans and a 
t-shirt. If you go too dressy, you&rsquo;ll be uncomfortable and a seller might 
increase his price because he thinks you can afford more. (It&rsquo;s 
sad&mdash;but true!)</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Get there early and come back late.</strong> At flea markets, 
auctions, and other day sales, the true bargains are often gone by the time 9 
a.m. rolls around, so if you want to spot a true find, go early. Prices are 
often steeper in the morning, however, so be sure to check back later in the 
evening when the seller&rsquo;s only choice is to sell it or haul it home.</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Inspect.</strong> Think you&rsquo;ve found a steal? Examine it 
from top to bottom before buying. Although it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll 
find a piece of furniture in mint condition, be sure the damage is something 
you&rsquo;re able to repair affordably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>6. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself. Although in your head you know you need a TV 
stand, the piece of furniture you purchase doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be 
a TV stand. Perhaps you repurpose an antique chair or end table to fit your 
needs instead. Make a list ahead of time of everything you need. When you spot 
something you think you like, consult your list to see where it could 
potentially work.</p> 
<p>7. <strong>Avoid electronics.</strong> With the exception of lamps, which 
can easily be rewired, avoid anything fueled by electricity&mdash;unless you 
have the know-how to repair it.</p> 
<p>8. <strong>Get inspired.</strong> Scour magazines, websites, and books for 
ideas.Home Envy has some great advice, as does the DIY Network. <em>Flea Market 
Finds &amp; How to Restore Them</em> ($7.98) and <em>Flea Market Style</em> 
($20.90) are both filled with tips and tricks on decorating with 
&ldquo;found&rdquo; objects. And, of course, it never hurts to look around you. 
Restaurants, shops, and others&rsquo; homes are fantastic motivators.</p> 
<p>Let me know how it goes! And I&rsquo;ll be sure to post any furniture 
makeovers of my own.</p>

<h3>Choosing the Best CFLs</h3> 
<p> We here at The Home Know-It-All are big proponents of Compact Fluorescent 
Light Bulbs (CFLs). And it&rsquo;s easy to see why: These gems use 75 percent 
less energy than standard incandescent bulbs and can last up to 10 times 
longer. Plus, you can save at least $30 in energy costs per year over the 
course of each bulb&rsquo;s lifetime. (And who isn&rsquo;t all for saving money 
right now?)</p> 
<p>So you can imagine our surprise when we recently learned that not all CFLs 
are equal&mdash;even those bearing the Energy Star label. According to the 
Environmental Working Group (EWG), some CFLs have a lower mercury content than 
others, and some last longer than others, making them a better, safer lighting 
option.</p> 
<p>Because mercury is something you don&rsquo;t want to mess with&mdash;it can 
cause brain and kidney damage&mdash;EWG is pushing for lower mercury content in 
CFLs and believes product labels should disclose the specific mercury content 
in each bulb. Read all about EWG&rsquo;s Lighten Up in &rsquo;09 campaignhere.
</p> 
<p>Curious to see how your existing CFLs fare? EWG identified seven CFLs that 
outweigh the competition. These bulbs contain minimal mercury and last anywhere 
from 8,000 to 15,000 hours. Use this guide the next time you go shopping for 
light bulbs.</p> 
<p>If your CFLs made the list, congrats. But if not, you don&rsquo;t need to 
rid your house of them&mdash;any CFL is better than a standard incandescent 
bulb. Just make sure that you properly dispose of it at the end of its lifespan 
so harmful mercury vapor isn&rsquo;t released.Earth911 explains how to safely 
recycle your spent bulbs. Should you happen to break a mercury-containing bulb, 
keep people and pets away and open a window. Then immediately followthese steps.

<h3>Green Bedding Basics</h3> 
<p> Although many folks would argue it&rsquo;s still not enough, we snooze 
more than a third of our lives away. That&rsquo;s a lot of time in bed! So it 
makes sense that we look for bedding that&rsquo;s comfortable and durable. 
Thankfully, we&rsquo;ve pretty much got you covered in that department. (Visit
Buying Bedding Basics and Bed Pillow Buying Guide to refresh your memory.) But 
there&rsquo;s something more important than those two qualifications, and 
it&rsquo;s essential to your health.</p> 
<p>Your bedding should also be organic. We&rsquo;ve already stressed the 
importance of anorganic mattress, but experts agree that your sheets, pillow, 
and comforter should also be natural.</p> 
<p>Icky pesticides and fertilizers are sprayed on cotton crops, tainting our 
environment and causing your cotton covers to off-gas&mdash;or release volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are known to cause allergies, asthma, and even 
cancer. If that&rsquo;s not enough to cause you to toss your unnatural sheets, 
consider this: Non-organic fibers are often harvested overseas, where no 
fair-labor laws exist. On top of that, once the bedding is made, it&rsquo;s 
often coated in formaldehyde&mdash;a probable carcinogen&mdash;to minimize 
wrinkling.</p> 
<p>To ensure your covers pass the natural test, look for &ldquo;organic&rdquo; 
cotton, which means the fiber was produced without pesticides or genetic 
engineering. (&ldquo;Green&rdquo; cotton isn&rsquo;t necessarily organically 
grown, but it is cheaper, making it the next best option.)&nbsp; Pesticide-free 
wool is another alternative, and because it&rsquo;s a breathable fabric, 
it&rsquo;s a good choice for warm sleepers. However, you should avoid 
polyester, which is largely made of non-renewable petroleum.</p> 
<p>Here are a few suggestions: </p> 
<p><strong>Comforter</strong><br>
Try: Natura Organic Wool Comforter 
($352.50-$535.00);Organic Inspirations Organic Cotton/Wool Comforter 
($320.00-$470.00); orEcoBedroom Natural Pure-Grow Wool Comforter 
($324.00-$462.00).</p> 
<p><strong>Sheets</strong><br>
Try: Native Organic Cotton Sheets 
($120.00-$180.00);White Lotus Organic Cotton Sheets ($150.00-$285.00); or Sage 
Creek Organic Jersey Sheet Set ($105.00).</p> 
<p><strong>Pillow</strong><br>
Try: Wheat Dreamz Buckwheat Pillow 
($40.00-$50.00),Abundant Earth Organic Cotton/Wool Pillow ($29.95-$65.95), 
Natura Organic Wool Pillow ($79.99-$117.99). </p>

<h3>Cool Green Tools</h3> 
<p>Conserving water and energy at home is an ongoing task for two groups of 
people: the ecologically-minded and the budget-focused. Whether you categorize 
yourself as one or both (as so many folks do these days), it never hurts to 
have a little help on your conquest to conserve.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why I tracked down these cool tools designed to help you 
reduce your use. Try one&mdash;or all&mdash;of them as part of The Home 
Know-It-All&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge and start saving!</p> 
<p><br>
<strong> Black &amp; Decker Thermal Leak Detector </strong><br>

Hunting down air leaks is as easy as pointing and shooting this handy tool. 
Shine the leak detector light on the wall to set a reference temperature, then 
point it at different areas around your house. The light turns blue to indicate 
a cold spot and red if it&rsquo;s hot, so you can easily identify leaks. Then 
all you have to do isseal and insulate to reduce your heating and cooling costs 
by up to 20 percent! Price: $39.99. Learn more:blackanddecker.com</p> 
<p><strong> Belkin Conserve Energy-Saving Surge Protector</strong><br>

Plugged-in home electronics suck energy even if they&rsquo;re not in use. But 
unplugging all those appliances and gadgets all the time can be a real pain. 
And who wants to unplug the DVR when you&rsquo;ll miss recording your favorite 
shows, anyway? Lucky us, both problems are solved with the Belkin Conserve. 
Plug everything into this surge protector and all you have to do is switch it 
off with the included remote control to stop power flow. Best of all, two of 
the plugs stay active even when the others are shut off, so you can keep items 
such as clocks, wireless Internet routers, or your precious DVR box on all the 
time. Price: $50&ndash;$60. Learn more:belkin.com/conserve</p> 
<p><br>
<strong> Watt Stopper Passive Infrared Wall Switch Vacancy Sensor
</strong><br>
It happens to the best of us&mdash;you rush out of the house only 
to discover hours later upon your return that you left all of the lights in the 
house blazing. Fortunately, forgetting to switch off the lights when you leave 
the room isn&rsquo;t a problem anymore if you install this sensor. It switches 
them off automatically after a room has been vacant for 30 minutes&mdash;and 
you can still flick the switch yourself whenever you please too. Price: $36. 
Learn more:wattstopper.com</p> 
<p><br>
<strong> Versaline Disappearing Clothesline</strong><br>
One of the 
easiest ways to save energy when it&rsquo;s laundry time is to stop using the 
dryer altogether. AsGreenYour points out, air-drying some or all of your wet 
laundry saves you as much as $135 in energy costs every year, prevents tons of 
CO2 from entering the atmosphere, and results in less wear on your clothing. 
Plus line-dried clothes smell so darn good. The problem is, some of us 
don&rsquo;t have a yard for or don&rsquo;t want the permanence of an in-ground 
line. Fortunately, the Aussies know what to do. They created this disappearing 
clothesline, which can be mounted any distance apart up to 16.5 feet and 
disappears out of sight when it&rsquo;s not in use&mdash;just remove it from 
its brackets and store it in the cupboard. Price: $180&ndash;$200. Learn more:
clotheslineshop.com</p> 
<p><br>
<strong> Brondell Perfect Flush</strong><br>
This one won&rsquo;t be 
available until May, but I wanted to share it with you anyway because 
it&rsquo;s going to be worth the wait. When installed (which should take less 
than half an hour), this handy gadget turns your everyday toilet into a 
dual-flush model. A two-button control allows you to dispense less water to 
flush liquids and more for solids, which can cut your household water use by up 
to 50 percent. Price: To be determined. Learn more:brondell.com</p>

<h3>Green Candles</h3> 
<p> Sure, green-hued candles are nice. But green candles&mdash;as in, 
environmentally friendly pillars and tea lights adding ambience to your 
home&mdash;are even nicer. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about in 
today&rsquo;s Green Around the House Challenge.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with standard candles? Plenty. Let&rsquo;s start with 
paraffin, the most common candle ingredient. It&rsquo;s a petroleum 
byproduct&mdash;in other words, even if you ride your bike to the store to buy 
those pretty candles to burn, you&rsquo;re relying on fossil fuels.</p> 
<p>And if your candles are scented, you&rsquo;re also putting your health at 
risk. That&rsquo;s because many scented candles contain synthetic fragrances. 
(Specifically, they contain chemicals such as phthalates, which have been shown 
to disrupt hormones.)</p> 
<p>Another dangerous culprit in these seemingly benign products: the wicks. 
Not all wicks are bad, but some candlewicks contain lead and release soot and 
toxins into the air when they&rsquo;re burned. (And, asUmbra points out, like 
anything that burns, candles give off particles and vapors that can irritate 
your respiratory system.) In the United States, candle manufacturers 
voluntarily stopped using lead wicks for this very reason. But if your candles 
weren&rsquo;t made in the United States, they may still have lead in the wicks. 
(Click Umbra&rsquo;s name above to learn how you can test your wicks to see if 
they include lead.)</p> 
<p>So what&rsquo;s a candle-lover to do? Never fear, because you don&rsquo;t 
have to forsake your candle habit altogether. As is the case with much of what 
we&rsquo;re including in our Green Around the House Challenge, you just have to 
shop smarter:</p> 
<p><strong>Buy natural candles.</strong> Beeswax candles are naturally 
fragrant, nontoxic, soot-free, and allergen-free (just make sure you&rsquo;re 
buying candles made from 100 percent beeswax). And, as long as the bee 
population doesn&rsquo;t diminish anymore, beeswax is a renewable resource. Soy 
is another candle option that&rsquo;s biodegradable, vegan, soot-free, and 
long-lasting. Or look for clean-burning wax made from palm oil (palm oil comes 
from coconuts, so no living plants are destroyed in the making of the oil).<br>

<strong><br>
Watch out for synthetic scents.</strong> Your best bet is to 
purchase unscented candles. But I&rsquo;m a realist and I know that part of the 
allure of candles is the wonderful scent they give off (even when they&rsquo;re 
not burning&mdash;the soy candles sitting in the sconces on my dining room wall 
emit a wonderful aroma every time I walk by them). So if you can&rsquo;t do 
without yummy smells, at least opt for those light sticks that get their scents 
from essential oils.</p> 
<p><strong>Avoid lead-containing wicks.</strong> Enough said.</p> 
<p><strong>Recycle.</strong> Yep, you read that right. Although they may be 
made from paraffin, recycled candles are an environmentally friendly option 
because you&rsquo;re reusing candle wax that was already produced rather than 
buying new. So make your own or buy recycled. Some candle-makers&mdash;like my 
friend Cara who sells her Mary Marie line of candles atEtsy&mdash;even use old 
glass jars, mugs, and the like for containing their candles. Now that&rsquo;s 
eco-friendly!</p> 
<p><br>
Until tomorrow,<br>

<h3>Heat Things Up With Pellet Stoves</h3> 
<p> Lower winter energy bills, heat individual rooms, and reduce the amount of 
waste that goes to the landfill&mdash;all at once. Sound too good to be true?
</p> 
<p>Actually, it isn&rsquo;t, thanks to a little something called a pellet 
stove. Think of it like a fireplace insert or freestanding stove&mdash;these 
devices typically heat individual rooms rather than the entire house (although 
they can do that too), so that you can turn down the thermostat. But instead of 
wood, they burn pellets: compressed sawdust, corn, wood shavings, and other 
wood waste that would normally go to the landfill.</p> 
<p>A charming alternative to gas or electric heating, pellet stoves 
don&rsquo;t require EPA certification because they emit so little pollution. 
Seriously. And unlike your standard hearth, pellet stoves produce zero creosote.
</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s how they work: You pour pellets into a refillable hopper. From 
there, a motorized auger feeds these pellets into a burn pot, where they 
combust. And that generates much-needed heat. Want to get more technical? Home 
expertDon Vandervort digs into the intricacies of how a pellet stove operates.
</p> 
<p>According to Vandevort, pellet stoves can be complicated and require 
occasional maintenance and regular attention, so you might be better off 
signing a service contract rather than trying to maintain the stove yourself. 
Another drawback: If you don&rsquo;t have a thermostat in every room, the heat 
from the stove might trick nearby thermostats into thinking the temperature in 
the area is at the set level. Nearby rooms become cold, and you end up raising 
your thermostat anyway.</p> 
<p>Want to see what they look like&mdash;or find one that would suit your 
home? Check out the pellet stove buying guide atPlanet Green. When shopping for 
a pellet stove, opt for one with a built-in thermostat&mdash;this feature 
ensures better temperature control.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to hop on over to Consumer Reports, where 
you&rsquo;ll find all kinds of important considerations for selecting the best 
stove for your heating needs. For instance, you&rsquo;ll want to determine fuel 
costs in your area and whether or not it makes sense to purchase a 
self-contained firebox insert or a freestanding stove. And just so you&rsquo;re 
as informed on the topic as possible, I also recommend reading theU.S. 
Department of Energy&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy guide to 
wood and pellet heating.</p>

<h3>Green Your Shower Curtain</h3> 
<p> Get excited! It&rsquo;s the first week of the Green Around the House 
Challenge. And as promised, our first challenge is greening your shower 
curtain. Why? This everyday object might be causing more problems than you 
think, starting with air pollution.</p> 
<p>I have to admit, I certainly wasn&rsquo;t thinking green when I bought my 
shower curtain a couple years ago. I was thinking blue, as in my blue bathroom 
color scheme. Fortunately, my chic blue-and-white embroidered curtain of choice 
was made of cotton. But the shower liner reeked of PVC.</p> 
<p>Yes, reeked. My bathroom is teeny-tiny, so the liner&rsquo;s icky, 
plastic-y odor infiltrated the space within minutes&mdash;and lingered. And 
that&rsquo;s when I wised up to the dangers of PVC. Here&rsquo;s why you should 
too:</p> 
<p><strong>The Problem Plastic Revealed</strong><br>
As I mentioned above, 
that unmistakable stench coming from your shower curtain is polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), a (sadly) popular plastic also known as vinyl. PVC is produced with 
toxic additives that can evaporate or leach out of the product. And it enters 
your body when you least expect it, whether through inhalation or direct skin 
or eye contact. This not-so-pleasant plastic has been linked to a slew of nasty 
health and environmental problems, including cancer, liver damage, and 
reproductive and immune system problems.</p> 
<p>Delightful, eh?</p> 
<p>It gets even worse. A recent study by the Center for Health, Environment 
&amp; Justice, a grassroots environmental organization based in Falls Church, 
Virginia, revealed disturbing facts about PVC shower 
curtains&mdash;that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called Volatile Vinyl. (Download the 
Volatile Vinyl reporthere.) According to the report, PVC shower curtains can 
release as many as 108 volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) into the air you 
regularly breathe. What&rsquo;s more, some of these chemicals were found in the 
air 28 days after a PVC shower curtain was opened and hung. No wonder I got a 
headache while putting on makeup in the bathroom each morning. That&rsquo;s a 
long time, folks!</p> 
<p><strong>End the Toxic Relationship&mdash;For Good</strong><br>
So, aside 
from that unmistakable stench, how can you tell if your shower curtain is made 
from PVC? Look for a &ldquo;3&rdquo; within the plastic recycling symbol or 
check to see if there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;V&rdquo; stamped in the plastic.</p> 
<p>If you recently purchased a PVC shower curtain, let it air out for a month 
before hanging it. Or, if you&rsquo;re in the market for a new shower curtain 
but haven&rsquo;t purchased one yet, shop for an eco-friendly cloth 
version&mdash;try organic cotton or linen (just make sure you have good 
ventilation to ward off mildew). Another option? Hemp is durable and naturally 
mildew-resistant. Or try recycled polyester plastic. When shopping for liners, 
opt for one made of nylon. Launch your search for eco-friendly options atGaiam, 
Health Goods, Pristine Planet, and IKEA.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming easier than ever to find non-PVC shower curtains and 
liners, because many major retailers and manufacturers are pulling the plug on 
the pesky plastic. IKEA, for example, phased out PVC shower curtains 11 years 
ago, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p> 
<p>Of course, once you set your sights on a newer, healthier shower curtain, 
another issue arises: getting rid of the old one. PVC shower curtains clog 
already-full landfills because they don&rsquo;t break down. And they 
don&rsquo;t play well with other plastics, making them a challenge to recycle.
Green Daily offers some ideas for putting that old vinyl curtain to good use. 
</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s to healthy breathing and safer showers.</p>

<h3>Great Indoor Planters</h3> 
<p>Whether lined up in a row, clustered in groups, or standing solo, planters 
are an easy way to spruce up a deck or patio. But they also add charm indoors 
too&mdash;especially during winter. And there&rsquo;s no better time than 
winter to give your d&eacute;cor a boost with plants and herbs housed in 
decorative containers. Here are a few of my favorites:<br>
<strong><br>
\ White 
delight.</strong> As you very well know by now, I&rsquo;m a fan of classic 
style. And that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t take my eye off the simple, timeless
Wirework Cachepots from Gardener&rsquo;s Supply Company ($44.95/set of three). 
The watertight steel pots feature a crisp white finish and are accented by a 
simple scalloped wirework design. Plus, each planter in the set is a different 
size&mdash;small, medium, and large. The result? A grouped display that adds 
dimension.</p> 
<p><strong>Modern-minded.</strong> If your style is more cutting-edge 
contemporary, then you&rsquo;ll like the sleek style of the column-shapeSelf 
Watering Cubico Flower Pots from Indoor Flower Pots.com (prices range from 
$29.90&ndash;$289.95 depending on size; if you want the sub-irrigation system 
included, add $60.85). These pots come in a variety of glossy or metallic hues, 
such as silver, espresso, and scarlet red.</p> 
<p><strong> Living art.</strong> Whether you hang it above your sofa or place 
it in your entryway, theIndoor Living Wall Planter from Gardener&rsquo;s Supply 
Company ($189) is quite the conversation starter. The planter comes in two 
forms: an indoor kit, which hangs on the walls, and a freestanding kit, which 
is a floor display. Both create instant drama. Bonus: watering is easier than 
you think. Water trickles down from the top reservoir into each pocket, and 
excess water collects in the bottom tray&mdash;not on your furniture.</p> 
<p><strong>Au naturel.</strong> For a rustic tabletop plant display, try the 
Carved Wooden Cachepots from Pottery Barn ($24&ndash;$34.00, depending on 
size). Made of renewable solid mango wood, these hand-carved planters add 
simplicity and warmth.</p> 
<p><strong> Taking a stand.</strong> Okay&mdash;plant stands aren&rsquo;t 
exactly containers. But they corral several plants at once and therefore save 
space. I like the deep finish of thePowell Contemporary Merlot Plant Stand from 
Stacks and Stacks ($95). It fits neatly in any corner, and there&rsquo;s a 
shelf underneath for extra display space.<br>
If you&rsquo;re really short on 
space like me, there&rsquo;s the diminutiveBamboo Tabletop Shelf from 
Improvements Catalog ($19.97, on sale). Like its name suggests, the tiered 
shelf&rsquo;s metal frame resembles bamboo, and its got three shelves to hold 
your favorite petite plants.</p>

<h3>Take the Green Around the House Challenge</h3> 
<p> Whether you believe in making New Year&rsquo;s resolutions or not, you 
have to admit that the start of a new year is a great time to contemplate 
positive improvements to your life&mdash;and the place you live. That&rsquo;s 
why we&rsquo;re going to present you with a project that we&rsquo;re calling 
the Green Around the House Challenge.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to work: At least once every week in 
2009, you&rsquo;ll see a post onThe Home Know-It-All related to going green 
around the house. Some of these ideas will be easy tips you can do in minutes. 
Others will require a bit more manpower or money. But all will be geared toward 
making your home a healthier, more environmentally friendly place.</p> 
<p>The goal with the Green Around the House Challenge isn&rsquo;t to overwhelm 
you with eco-friendly to-dos. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s only one per week. 
We&rsquo;re all busy with work and family and friends and DIY projects. But one 
green challenge a week? You have to admit, that&rsquo;s pretty doable.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re going to roll out the first challenge next Tuesday, when Katie 
fills us in on how to green our shower curtains. And the week after that? Stay 
tuned for cool green tools that can help you detect air leaks around your house 
and more. And that&rsquo;s just for starters.</p> 
<p>So get ready to get green. And be sure to share your going green success 
stories&mdash;not to mention the challenges you might face&mdash;in the 
comments section below each blog post. We really do want to hear from you!</p>

<h3>Post-Holiday Recycling</h3> 
<p> Whew&mdash;you made it through another whirlwind Christmas. How did it go? 
Gauging by the mound of garbage at my door, I&rsquo;d say things went pretty 
well here. But this year instead of chucking it all in the trash, I&rsquo;m 
going to recycle. And you should too. Everything from your cardboard boxes to 
your Christmas tree can be reused. So gather it up and get ready to save the 
planet.<br>
<strong><br>
Boxes</strong><br>
If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to 
have curbside recycling, it&rsquo;s likely the program will accept both flat 
and corrugated cardboard. Break down all those boxes from your new electronics 
and toys and send them to the curb. No curbside recycling? VisitThe Recycling 
Center&rsquo;s website to find a center in your town, or check with local 
grocery stores to see if they accept boxes. And don&rsquo;t forget egg nog and 
other cardboard food containers&mdash;just give them a good scrub before 
dropping them in the recycling box.<br>
<strong><br>
Batteries</strong><br>

Because of all the toxic metals in rechargeable batteries&mdash;think mercury, 
lead acid, nickel cadmium, alkaline, and nickel metal hydride&mdash;it&rsquo;s 
important that you dispose of them properly. And thanks to the Battery Act of 
1996, recycling rechargeable NiCard, NiMH, Lithium-Ion, and sealed lead-acid 
batteries is easier than ever. The next time you&rsquo;re out and about swing 
by a local retail store like Home Depot, Wal-Mart, or Target to drop off your 
dead rechargeable batteries to be recycled. The best part? It&rsquo;s 
free!&nbsp;<br>
<strong><br>
Wrapping Paper</strong><br>
Not all wrapping paper 
is recyclable. If it has metallic specks or is very thin, you can&rsquo;t send 
it to the recycle center. Rather than throw it away, pass it through the 
shredder and use it as filler for other presents. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling 
mighty crafty, try your hand atpaper beads. For more ideas on how to recycle 
gift wrap, head on over toCraft Stew. </p> 
<p><strong>Christmas Tree</strong><br>
And finally, you can&rsquo;t forget the 
tree. We filled you in last year on how to recycle it, but just in case 
you&rsquo;ve forgotten how, read all about ithere. </p> 
<p>So what else are you recycling this year? </p>

Until tomorrow, <br>

<h3>Green Insulation</h3> 
<p> We&rsquo;ve talked about the importance of insulating your home to save 
energy and money. While you&rsquo;re at it, why not go a step further&mdash;for 
the good of the environment and your health&mdash;with environmentally friendly 
insulation? There are a lot of options available right now. Here are a few.</p> 
<p><strong>Recycled.</strong> Keep waste out of the landfill and stay warm by 
opting for recycled insulation. Recycled insulation may be made from a number 
of materials, including melted minerals and sand or recycled glass 
(fiberglass), recycled newspaper (cellulose, paper), recycled steel slag 
(rockwool), and mill waste and low-grade and recycled cotton (cotton). Learn 
about the pluses and minuses of each atGreenyour.com.</p> 
<p>One recycled-content insulation that has received quite a lot of press 
lately isUltraTouch Natural Cotton Fiber Insulation, produced by Bonded Logic. 
This insulation is made from 85 percent post-industrial cotton (think denim 
manufacturing scraps). It&rsquo;s treated with a natural fire retardant, is 100 
percent recyclable, and is VOC-free.</p> 
<p><strong>Hemp.</strong> HempFlax insulation mats are made from natural hemp 
fibers with some polyester fiber for reinforcing. They are available in several 
thicknesses for insulating roofs, walls, and floors. Hemp processing is clean 
and low on dust.</p> 
<p><strong>Sheep&rsquo;s Wool.</strong> Thermafleece sheep&rsquo;s wool 
insulation is produced bySecond Nature. Sheep&rsquo;s wool is safe and easy to 
handle and, unlike traditional insulation, won&rsquo;t cause itching and skin 
irritation. Plus, wool captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which, 
according to the company website, gives Thermafleece a negative global warming 
potential.</p> 
<p><strong>Spray-In Foam.</strong> Spray-in foam starts out as a liquid and, 
once it is sprayed, expands and solidifies, working as an air barrier to stop 
more than 90 percent of air infiltration and minimizing allergens and pollution 
in your house. Some spray-in foam is loaded with chemicals, but others, like
Icynene, are water-blown and don&rsquo;t offgas nasty chemicals. (Icynene is 
free of formaldehyde too.)</p> 
<p><strong>Soy.</strong> Another spray-in option: soy-based polyurethane, 
produced byBioBased Insulation. It&rsquo;s made with soybean oil, so there 
aren&rsquo;t any petrochemicals, and you won&rsquo;t have to worry about mold 
growth (or pests eating it). Soy-based polyurethane is also free of CFCs and 
VOCs. BioBased Insulation was the first polyurethane spray foam insulation to 
earn GREENGUARD certification. Learn more about it from this<em>Fine 
Homebuilding</em> video.</p> 
<p><strong>Mushrooms.</strong> OK. This insulation isn&rsquo;t made solely 
from mushrooms. ButGreensulate is made from agricultural waste 
products&mdash;think rice and buckwheat hulls&mdash;combined with mycelium, 
which is a fibrous network created by mushrooms. The petroleum-free insulation 
is priced similar to standard rigid board insulation (like Styrofoam) and has a 
comparable R-value. And, perhaps best of all, when you&rsquo;re done with it, 
Greensulate will rapidly break down, enriching the soil and even helping nearby 
waste breakdown too. The only catch? You&rsquo;ll have to wait a while to try 
it out&mdash;it probably won&rsquo;t be available as insulation until the end 
of 2010 (although you can buy other Greensulate products, such as coolers, now).
