<h1>Real vs. Artificial Christmas Trees</h1> 
<p> by Lori Brown 11/29/10 37 Comments Tweet </p> 
<p>The real versus artificial Christmas tree debate replays itself year after 
year. But the truth is, each option has its own place on the naughty-and-nice 
list.</p> 
<p>Just a few short decades ago, displaying a Christmas tree in your living 
room really only yielded one option: a real pine or fir tree. That all changed 
when a U.S.-based toilet bowl brush manufacturer, the Addis Brush Company, 
created an artificial tree from brush bristles in the 1930s, acting as the 
prototype for modern artificial trees.</p> 
<p>Artificial trees became increasingly popular, with sales jumping to 17.4 
million in 2007. Photo: sxc.hu</p> 
<h2>The Pros and Cons of Artificial</h2> 
<p>Guilt. Many have made it the sole reason to invest in an artificial tree. 
The thought of cutting down a new tree each year can put a damper on the 
holidays for some.</p> 
<p>Also, cost, convenience and environmental impact are other reasons 
consumers opt for an artificial tree.</p> 
<p>Given the current economic climate, artificial trees may be especially 
appealing for their investment value when compared with the recurrent, annual 
expense of a real Christmas tree. Their convenience is also appealing to 
consumers as they don&rsquo;t need watering, don&rsquo;t leave pine needles all 
over the floor and transportation from tree farm to home isn&rsquo;t an issue.
</p> 
<p>But many experts believe artificial trees actually have a <em>greater</em> 
negative environmental impact when all aspects of an their life cycle are 
considered.</p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s artificial trees are typically manufactured with metal and 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a non-biodegradable, petroleum-derived plastic. In 
addition, many older varieties may contain lead, used as a stabilizer in the 
manufacturing process.</p> 
<p>Despite their PVC contents, artificial trees are non-recyclable and 
non-biodegradable, meaning they will sit in a landfill for centuries after 
disposal.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, approximately 85 percent of artificial trees sold in the U.S. 
are imported fromChina, according to the National Christmas Tree Association 
(NCTA), adding to their overall environmental footprint.</p> 
<h2>The Pros and Cons of Real</h2> 
<p>There are about 500,000 acres in production for growing Christmas trees. 
Each acre provides the daily oxygen requirements of 18 people. Photo: 
Flickr/looseends</p> 
<p>Approximately 33 million real Christmas trees are sold in North America 
each year, according to the U.S. EPA. Luckily, about 93 percent of those trees 
are recycled through more than 4,000 available recycling programs.</p> 
<p>Also known as &ldquo;treecycling,&rdquo; the act of recycling a Christmas 
tree is a leading reason many experts agree they are more environmentally 
friendly than their plastic counterparts.</p> 
<p>Treecycling is an easy way to return a renewable and natural source back to 
the environment instead of disposing it&nbsp;in a landfill, where decomposition 
rates are slowed due to lack of oxygen.</p> 
<p>Christmas trees are recycled into mulch and used in landscaping and 
gardening or chipped and used for playground material, hiking trails, paths and 
walkways. They can be used for beachfronterosion prevention, lake and river 
shoreline stabilization and fish and wildlife habitat.</p> 
<p>A single farmed tree absorbs more than 1 ton of CO2 throughout its 
lifetime. With more than 350 million real Christmas tress growing in U.S. tree 
farms alone, you can imagine the yearly amount of carbon sequestering 
associated with the trees. Additionally, each acre of trees produces enough 
oxygen for the daily needs of 18 people.</p> 
<p>In order to ensure a healthy supply of Christmas trees each year, growers 
must use sustainable farming techniques. For each tree harvested, one to three 
seedlings are planted the following spring, ensuring a healthy supply of trees.
</p> 
<p>According to the NCTA, the Christmas tree industry employs more than 
100,000 Americans, an important economic consideration in the real versus 
artificial debate.</p> 
<p>Besides the aforementioned cons associated with real Christmas trees, they 
are farmed as agricultural products, meaning repeated applications ofpesticides
, herbicides and fertilizers may be used throughout their lifetime. The ideal 
tree would be raised organically, using integrated pest management techniques 
rather than chemicals.</p> 
<p>Another con associated with real Christmas trees may depend on where you 
live. For climates where coniferous trees don&rsquo;t grow, that tree in your 
living room may have had to travel hundreds of miles to reach the lot, 
significantly impacting the environmental impact associated with travel. 
However, a tree trucked from a couple states away is still traveling thousands 
of miles less than one from overseas.</p> 
<h2>An Even Better Option</h2> 
<p>Go one step further than the real versus artificial debate and consider a 
living, potted tree this Christmas. Though not feasible for everybody due to 
climate and land availability, living trees are brought into the home for about 
10 days, then replanted after Christmas. If you don&rsquo;t have the land for 
replanting, your local parks department will likely accept your tree for 
planting after the holidays.</p> 
<h2>The Verdict?</h2> 
<p>So what&rsquo;s the final word? Drumroll please&hellip; Real trees top our 
charts for holiday adornment. Even though they might shed needles on your 
floor, the investment in a U.S.-based product, the carbon-neutral nature of 
their production and their ease of recycling make them a clear winner.</p>

<p>Good article. Please consider adding to the pro&rsquo;s &amp; con&rsquo;s 
of real trees, the number of fires and deaths caused by real trees at this time 
of the year due to people forgetting to water the tree(s), use the wrong 
lights, put the tree too close to a heating source, and many other reasons. 
Usually artificial trees are fire retardent.</p> 
<p>Thanks for your time.</p> 
<p>Wishing you and yours a Safe, Blessed and Merry Christmas.</p> </li>

<p>Real christmas tree farms are not the environmentally friendly industries 
that they seem to be. Besides the HEAVY use of toxic pesticides , they are 
fairly devoid of wildlife as they encompass acres and acres of land comprised 
of a single species. Also the trees are trimmed, and grass is mowed regularly 
discouraging nesting birds, and other wildlife. Real trees frequently have 
molds and mosses growing on the trunks and will emit spores once exposed to 
warm livingroom. This can cause asthma, sinusitus, and sometimes anaphalxsis in 
severly allergic people. I have 3 times in my life thrown out perfectly 
wonderful real trees just days before Christmas because it made my living space 
toxic and unlivable. Explain that to the kids!Choose your poison carefully!</p>

<p>I am a bit puzzled by your statement &ldquo;a single farmed tree absorbs 
more than 1 ton of CO2 throughout its lifetime&rdquo;. If one tree absorbed one 
ton of CO2, then it would weigh at least 1 ton. In reality, the tree must be 
shedding 95% of that weight in the form of pine needles, bark, sap, etc. 
throughout its lifetime.</p> 
<p>Also, there is a misconception about trees locking up CO2. Sure, they store 
CO2 in solid form while they&rsquo;re alive. But when they decompose all of 
that carbon is eventually broken back down and emitted back into the atmosphere 
as CO2 or methane. That&rsquo;s the definition of carbon neutral.</p> 
<p>Lastly, its not clear to me which has a bigger impact: shipping a lighter 
plastic tree via cargo ship from China to Houston (which has a port), or 
shipping a heavier, real tree from Oregon to Houston by diesel truck. Boats are 
much more efficient than trucks, so its hard to tell which method has a bigger 
impact per tree.</p> </li>

<p>I am a bit shocked that a earth911 website chose a real tree over a fake 
one. now, I&rsquo;m not arguing against having a real tree, in fact my family 
cuts one down each year, but I am surprised with the comments that have been 
posted. I want to say the posters of those comments are arguing so heavily 
against having a real tree because they thought they were doing right by buying 
a fake one, but then proved wrong. But&hellip; I can&rsquo;t say that for sure. 
I would defiantly go with a real tree that is a recyclable and a positive 
contribution to the environment over a tree made from harmful chemicals that is 
not able to be recycled.<br>
 You can always plant more trees if you are 
worried about the oxygen&hellip;<br>
 You can&rsquo;t reverse pollution in the 
air caused by chemicals that were used to make the trees and you can&rsquo;t 
reverse pollution from the trees sitting there in a landfill</p> </li>

<p>I cut down a real Nihilism (aka Christmas) tree each year in a national 
forest. I love eluding the park rangers. It&rsquo;s a real life video game 
&hellip;. Not really. Actually, I pay them $10 for the privilige of helping 
them manage the forest. Tromping through the snow; dragging the tree back to 
the car-It&rsquo;s a blast. I could care less which is more environmentally 
friendly. It&rsquo;s a family tradition that gets us all in the spirit of the 
holiday.</p> 
<p>Ditto, my bike commute.<br>
 20 miles each way. Over 5000 miles a year. 
Screw the environment. I ride because I like to ride.</p> 
<p>Mother earth will be here long after mankind has perished. It&rsquo;s not 
about the environment. It&rsquo;s about you saving the environment the way you 
want it to be saved for you, at someone else&rsquo;s expense. Get over 
yourselves. And Merry Christmas.</p> </li>

<p>Sense and sensibility. For me, only a real tree will do. It&rsquo;s a taste 
thing. I&rsquo;ve seen some of these magnificent and expensive artificial trees 
&ndash; they look ideal from a distance. Get a bit closer and you see what they 
really are: fakes. For me, that&rsquo;s a big let-down that only serves to 
heighten the worst aspects of consumerism and artifice that have grown to taint 
America&rsquo;s Christmas. Do you want to see plastic flowers? Do you want to 
eat artificial food? Do you want to go to a museum full of replicas and 
forgeries? Go real!</p> </li>

<p>Real is great for a while. They do become expensive if you what an 
attractive tree you can display with pride. They can be burdensome if you are 
in a time crunch, or one person gets stuck with the messy clean up and daily 
watering. As time goes on after many real trees We decided to get a pre lit 
artificial tree. The time up and down was reduced by an entire day and we did 
not have to go out in the cold and suffer the hunt for the perfect tree. The 
tree we got was a new natural branching pattern design and the strong limbs 
that are better suited for the larger ornaments sold today. It was nice to have 
the fresh cut tree in the house, but I would never go back. I actually think 
with all the chemicals that need to be used to grow those near perfect trees 
which every one wants, that the artificial tree is in the long run a better 
investment.</p> </li>

<p>I bought a Fake tree about 20 years ago. The good thing about this 
particular tree is that the &ldquo;needles&rdquo; are made from recycled 
newspaper, colored green. It has held up very well, with only a few spots where 
the daily news is now showing thru. Maybe more tree manufacturers should be 
responsible and make the trees from recycled materials!!!!! The best of both 
worlds!</p> </li>

<p>Those arguments are not taking into consideration that I am not discarding 
my artificial tree after Xmas. I have my artificial tree for 6 years now and I 
plan on keeping it for many more. And diesel trucks transporting tons of trees 
in order to sell and later to recycle, and later to sell the mulch are doing as 
much harm as the transportation of artificial ones.<br>
 I just think it is 
very sad after Xmas to look at the real (dead) trees, discarded on the streets. 
If the trees are made of PVC is simple to the US to solve the problem: stop 
importing such things from China and start buying only recycled material. It is 
not like is mandatory to do business like that with China.</p> </li>

<p>Hello Lori,</p> 
<p>I always enjoyed having a Douglas Fir or Balsam tree for the holidays. 
Until, I allowed others<br>
 to influence me into purchasing an artificial tree 
which went against my good judgment.<br>
 And truly, for all the wrong reasons 
as well.</p> 
<p>After reading your article; I am deeply concerned for having purchased an 
artificial tree that is<br>
 a problem to the environment and the issue of 
proper disposal of it afterwards.</p> 
<p>Thank you for posting this article. It brings out many excellent points 
that should be considered.</p> </li>

<p>I genuinely think that artificial trees are the way forward and considering 
they are so maintenance free, i&rsquo;m surprised not everyone has caught on to 
how good they really are. I certainly won&rsquo;t be wasting my time with real 
trees now that i have some artificial trees in my garden.</p> </li>

<p>I find it amazing the the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; is between artificial trees 
and cut trees. On the birth of each of my sons I planted a tree for each of 
them. Apart from the huge pleasure it has given me to see these trees grow and 
prosper, like my sons, I see them through all the season and even when my sons 
and there now families cannot attend festive occasions they are here is a real 
sense through their &ldquo;birth&rdquo; tree.</p> 
<p>So I strongly encourage each and every person who is able to plant a tree, 
not just a yule tide tree but a tree for all seasons</p> </li>

<p>Earty to Marcel, abosorbing CO2 doesn&rsquo;t mean it becaomes a part of 
the tree&mdash;it&rsquo;s the air that a tree breathes in. Actually, 
&ldquo;converts&rdquo; would be a more accurate way of describing it, because 
the tree converts CO2 to oxygen.</p> 
<p>Think of it this way, we &ldquo;absorb&rdquo; oxygen and exhale 
CO2&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t mean we store it, or that it adds to our weight or 
that we suddenly release it all into the atmosphere when we expire. I also 
&ldquo;absorb&rdquo; a few litres of water a day, that doesn&rsquo;t make it a 
permanent part of my body.</p> </li>

<p>I think a lot of people make environmental decisions based on emotion and 
not actual numbers/fact, partly because finding those actual numbers/facts are 
very difficult or sometimes impossible to accurately determine. Even 
people&rsquo;s comments to this post about the sight of dead trees thrown out 
supports this emotional basis of decisions. Christmas adds another element of 
emotion and tradition so it&rsquo;s very easy to spin the argument your way. I 
would have liked to seen more numbers and actual methodology used by the author 
when calculating the life cycle costs, but I guess this was more a qualitiative 
exercise. How much pesticides are used on Christams trees? Was the different 
GHG emissions of boat vs. truck taken into account? Without actual numbers, we 
are still just guessing which is the better option. But the US grown tree vs. 
made in China can be a convincing arguement by itself in today&rsquo;s economy. 
In all, I buy a real tree for the reasons laid out in the article and I guess 
it&rsquo;s nice to see that decision is somewhat backed up.</p> </li>

<p>There is some emotion and tradition involved in my decision to buy a real 
tree each year. But I do so in the most environmentally responsible way that is 
available to me. I choose a local tree farmer, so I make sure that the tree is 
not traveling hundreds of miles to get to my house. I try my best to research 
to find out if pesticides are being used, and that the tree farmer is growing 
as sustainably as possible. My township picks up the trees for recycling, and I 
don&rsquo;t find it sad that they are waiting to be picked up at the curb 
anymore then I am when I put my recycle bin out each week. Every buying 
circumstance allows us to evaluate our environmental impact, and I think that 
almost everyone on this message board is taking this opportunity to think about 
their purchases, no matter which kind of tree they buy.</p> </li>

<p>I grew up on &ldquo;Charlie Brown trees.&rdquo; Going out in to the woods 
behind the house to find one was a family tradition. Unfortunately those woods 
are no longer there, but every year the Army base lets people on their huge 
tracts of land for that purpose at no charge!<br>
 Thank you to Mike for his 
response to Marcel, who is clearly not a botanist.<br>
 I still haven&rsquo;t 
made up my mind on frexh vs fake though. Nothing beats the smell of a fresh 
spruce, but the convenience of a fake might win me over one day. I definately 
agree with Sophie and Leslie though. If an American company came up with a 
decent looking fake tree that was made out of recycled materials and/or 
recyclable, preferably both, I would probably buy one.<br>

<p>Hello Lori,</p> 
<p>Wow! I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the pesticides associated with live trees 
before. That definitely is an eye opener. However, I like the idea of organic 
with regard to the growing of plants, trees, etc. I think it is not only 
beneficial to the earth as a whole, but it will make the soil less toxic for 
people who reside in the areas that grow crops, live trees, etc. I think the 
whole concept altogether is an excellent idea.</p> 
<p>Additionally, I never had an artificial christmas tree till someone in the 
family here fussed over the pine needles dropping off as the live tree starts 
to lose it&rsquo;s freshness.Artificial ones are also loaded with not so 
healthy things too. I always was thrilled when I was able to go tree hunting 
for that special fresh Douglas Fir tree. It smelled so wonderful too. There 
could possibly be some good with this organic thinking.</p> </li>

<p>NO FAKE. NO CUT REAL. Christmas is great, but why have either kind of tree? 
You have to be a progressive thinking person to accept this idea&hellip;we 
project a large image of a beautifully decorated Christmas tree on a wall in 
the living room. Then place our own home made Christmas tree near the picture 
image. It looks really cool.</p> 
<p>We make our tree using large pieces of discarded but clean corrugated 
cardboard. We cut-out and assembled it to stand on its own. Our grandkids then 
make decorations and &ldquo;spiffy it all up&rdquo; for Christmas. The 
cardboard is recycled at the end of the season. Everyone loves to help make a 
Merry Christmas.<br>
 A Christmas tree is just a &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; that we 
traditionally &ldquo;decorate&rdquo; in the spirit of the Holiday. 
But&hellip;it is becoming more about a symbol for spending money in December to 
support consumerism.</p> 
<p>Buy a potted green tree if you feel the urge to spend money! Plant it &amp; 
enjoy it everyday of the year.</p> </li>

pine needles or chewed on the electrical cord. i have had the same artificial 
tree for 30 yrs. now and i planted a couple of live Christmas trees in my back 
yard (after Christmas specials). i don&rsquo;t even have lights on my tree this 
year, just decorations my gran-daughters made for me. best tree ever!</p> </li>

because it will be cheaper) and I still get to celebrate Christmas.</p> </li>

<p>I agree with Robert! &ldquo;We make our tree using large pieces of 
discarded but clean corrugated cardboard. We cut-out and assembled it to stand 
on its own.&rdquo; I would make the cardboard tree cut out then recycle it.</p> 
<p>Or I could get a real tree and just plant it for next year. Thanks for the 
great idea.</p> </li>

<p>I bought a tree for a dollar after Christmas a few years ago at a grocery 
store cause I felt sorry that it was left there. I repotted it and have used it 
for the last two years. It is a little weird looking cause I am not a tree 
farmer and am allergic to pine needles. So I did not trim it to look perfect. 
But with the economy the way it has been and my teens not really wanting to 
help decorate the tree, it made sense to use this one. And it only costs a 
dollar and no one pesticided it to death as I am allergic to poisons. I have 
asthma. I just bring it in for a few weeks then put it back outside. No muss, 
no fuss, although there was a moth hitchhiker.</p> </li>

<p>For the last five years I have used a vintage silver tree. I Love It! 
It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;REUSE&rdquo; idea. I like the editor&rsquo;s idea of buying 
a potted tree &amp; planting it after wards&hellip;would you end up with a 
forest? Maybe start donating them after 2nd or 3rd year. I think this year I 
will stick w/ my vintage &amp; next year if economy gets better I will splurge 
on potted tree!</p> </li>

<p>I have never considered using a planted living tree. What a fantastic idea!

<p>Mike Hovis comments above that he is allergic to trees and other natural 
lifeforms. That&rsquo;s sad, but certainly not a reason for most others who can 
have plants in their home. While a large commercial Christmas tree farm is 
likely committing the environmental sins as he described, try getting a tree 
for a local grower, possibly organic. Pine trees have few natural pests and are 
not sprayed heavily, if at all. I think reusing an old fake tree or getting a 
locally grown one (in a pot, is a good idea!) is a lot better for the 
environment then adding to the demand for synthetic trees.</p> </li>

<p>You know, this year I looked up Christmas Tree Alternatives and found a lot 
of very handy and attractive reusable ideas. We haven&rsquo;t had a Christmas 
tree of any variety for the past few years, but this year I felt like I wanted 
one so the option we chose was using some green construction paper and folding 
it to make it look like leaves. The source for this was:
http://greenbrokelivinginkits.blogspot.com/2010/12/substitute-christmas-trees.html
</p> 
<p>It worked out really well and we were even able to put lights on it! Next 
year, we might make a mobile but this is definitely reusable. And it was a fun 
family experience!</p> </li> </ol>
