<p><strong>Real vs. artificial Christmas trees</strong><br>
<em>12/03/2007 
</em><br>
<em>- Dawn House <br>
 Salt Lake Tribune</em></p> 
<p><em>Joseph Sharp, president of Yule Tree Farms in Canby, Ore., oversees the 
harvesting of more than 3,800 acres of trees.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Are real 
trees making a comeback?</strong><br>
<br>
 Over the past few years, Christmas 
tree prices have stabilized and although there are competitive prices in 
certain areas, the toughest competitor to the American-grown tree is the 
Chinese-made artificial tree. Additionally, real trees are ecologically better 
than fake, and consumers are becoming aware of this. Approximately 30 million 
to 35 million real Christmas trees are sold in the country every year.<br>
<br>

<strong>Don't artificial trees take pressure off land dumps? </strong><br>
<br>

 Real trees are biodegradable, and an increasing number are mulched and used as 
compost or used to prevent beach and stream erosion. Artificial Christmas 
trees, with their average life of four years, will survive in a landfill for 
hundreds of years. On top of that, they can often contain lead dust, PVC and 
insects, and are not environmentally friendly.<br>
<br>
<strong>What about the 
sale of real trees and deforestation?</strong><br>
<br>
 Real trees are 
sustainable and are actually the best choice for the environment. The trees are 
grown on farmland just like other row crops such as corn, grain or berries. For 
every tree harvested, at least one other is planted in its place. A new 
organization, the Coalition of Environmentally Conscious Growers, is certifying 
growers who are environmentally responsible.<br>
<br>
<strong>Explain the 
coalition.</strong><br>
<br>
 Founded by Yule Tree Farms and Holiday Tree Farms 
in August, the Coalition of Environmentally Conscious Growers is a 
not-for-profit 501(c)(6). It is dedicated to sustainable growing practices and 
consumer education. Coinciding with its formation was the creation of a 
Grower's Certification audited by Freer Consulting, an independent party based 
in Seattle. The first of its kind, the certification evaluates growers on 
erosion control/soil conservation, integrated pest management and tributary 
protection. Additionally, the organization has developed hang tags to mark 
trees that have been certified as having been grown under stringent 
environmental criteria. More than 200,000 [Oregon] trees will bear the tags 
this year, and about a dozen other farms are on the certification waiting list 
from states such as Michigan and North Carolina.</p>
