 Christmas trees 
are appearing in homes throughout the country and families prepare for the 
holiday season. But in this age when we are all asked to be aware of the impact 
we are having on the environment, is the right choice to purchase an artificial 
tree and use it year after year, or go in search of the perfect living tree to 
be the centerpiece of our holiday decorating?<br>
<br>
 The answer may surprise 
you.
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <br>
<br>
 Artificial trees do offer a long-term solution for your 
Christmas tree decorating needs. And I have to admit, the latest generation of 
&ldquo;fake&rdquo; trees don&rsquo;t look that fake. They&rsquo;ve come a long 
way from the first artificial trees that were actually manufactured by a toilet 
brush company. That&rsquo;s right, the first artificial tree was pretty much a 
really tall, green, toilet brush. But today, until you get close, you&rsquo;d 
be hard pressed to distinguish the artificial trees from the real thing&hellip; 
except of course for the missing fresh pine smell.<br>
<br>
 Economically, 
artificial trees can also be easier on your wallet. For the cost of a single 
large live tree, you can purchase an artificial tree that looks the same but 
will last for several holiday seasons. Sticker shock has become part of the 
annual trek out to find the family Christmas tree at a local tree lot. If you 
want your real tree to meet your eye level or above, be prepared to pay in the 
neighborhood of $100 before you can lash the tree to your roof and drive it 
home.<br>
<br>
 So if they look the same, cost less, can be used year after 
year, and can prevent living trees from being chopped down&hellip; should we 
all be lining up to purchase an artificial tree this year? Well, maybe not.<br>

<br> While chopping down a living tree may see like the most un-environment 
friendly thing you can do, in this situation it actually appears to be the 
&ldquo;greener&rdquo; choice. Because it&rsquo;s not so much about how many 
uses you can get from your tree&hellip; as it is about what the tree is made 
of, and what it does to the environment when it is created and when you dispose 
of it.<br>
<br>

<p> </p> Artificial trees are manufactured using a polyvinyl chloride (or 
PVC), which is a petroleum-derived plastic. The raw material for fake Christmas 
trees is both non-renewable and polluting. Furthermore, PVC production results 
in the unhealthy emission of a number of carcinogens, such as dioxin, ethylene 
dichloride and vinyl chloride.<br>
<br>
 Additionally, in order to make the PVC 
needles on artificial trees more malleable, the manufacturers use lead and 
other additives that have been linked to liver, kidney, neurological, and 
reproductive system damage in lab studies on animals. The Children&rsquo;s 
Health Environmental Coalition warns fake trees &quot;may shed lead-laced dust, 
which may cover branches or shower gifts and the floor below the tree.&quot;<br>
<br> Some artificial trees actually come with warning labels due to their lead 
content. And not that we&rsquo;ve recently had any problems with excess lead 
content in items imported from China (ahem), but approximately 85% of the 
artificial trees imported by the United States come from China.<br>
<br>
 
Richard Maas, the director of the Environmental Studies program at the 
University of North Carolina-Asheville, offers some tips for people who suspect 
that their artificial tree may contain lead:<br>
<br>
 - Keep children away 
from the tree. Do not allow them to touch the tree.<br>
<br>
 - If you touch 
the tree, was your hands thoroughly before touching your face or handling food.
<br> <br>
 - Do not vacuum dust from under the tree, especially with a vacuum 
that does not have a HEPA filter. Vacuuming could spread lead dust through the 
air in tiny particles, creating an inhalation danger.<br>
<br>
 Hmmm. Well 
then&hellip; that puts a bit of a damper on the Christmas cheer.<br>
<br>
 So 
what about real Christmas trees? Well, we know what they are made of&hellip; an 
all natural, all renewable source. But there are some components of the 
Christmas tree industry that aren&rsquo;t quite as green. Most trees are 
harvested after 8-12 years, and require maintenance over that period. In 
addition to watering, some Christmas tree farms use pesticides and chemicals 
for pest control and to speed growth. Also, when it comes time for delivering 
those trees to Christmas tree lots, they must be transported by truck to the 
local communities.<br>
<br>

<p> </p> The good news is, while those trees are growing they help to 
sequester the carbon dioxide that is produced by modern industries. Each year, 
an acre of Douglas fir trees can absorb 11,308.7 lbs of carbon dioxide. And 
frequently, Christmas tree farms are placed in areas that would otherwise be 
unusable. Due to their hardiness, Christmas trees can be planted on barren 
slopes where few other plants successfully grow, as well as fill in areas under 
power lines.<br>
<br>
 When the time comes for harvesting the trees, each tree 
that is cut down must be replaced. So most tree farms plant 1 to 3 new trees 
for every one that is cut, in order to to maintain a constant supply. So 
fortunately the tree population is not reduced due to Christmas tree farming; 
but instead is maintained, protected, and in many instances increased.<br>
<br>

 And in terms of the transportation costs and impact, trees must be grown 
fairly locally in order to make it into homes while still fresh. So some 
transporting and trucking is part of the supply line&hellip; but most likely is 
a much shorter trip and burns much less fuel than importing artificial trees 
from China. And there is the added bonus of supporting a local businesses as 
opposed to buying a foreign import.<br>
<br>
 But if you buy ten real trees in 
ten years as opposed to only one artificial tree in the same period, do the 
benefits of the real trees still outweigh the negatives of the fake ones? 
Clearly you can save money by purchasing a single artificial tree. But it is 
important to look at the environmental difference between the two options.<br>

<br> An artificial tree may be used for 5, 10, or 15 years&hellip; but 
eventually it will be disposed of it in favor of something new. Unfortunately 
artificial trees are not biodegradable and cannot be recycled, so their 
disposal has a significant impact to the environment. If disposed in a 
landfill, artificial trees will never breakdown but rather permanently remain 
in landfills. If disposed of by incineration, the PVC in artificial trees will 
emit into the atmosphere dioxins and other carcinogens into the air.<br>
<br>
 
On the other hand, when the holidays are over a real tree can be recycled. The 
branches and trees can be ground into mulch. The mulch provides a protective 
barrier for the roots of other plants and vegetation while preventing weeds 
from growing. The mulch then decomposes, providing the nutrients plants need.
<br> <br>
 In our area, it isn&rsquo;t even necessary to transport your tree to 
a recycling center. The Boy Scouts come by each neighborhood during the two 
weekends following Christmas, and for a small donation will pick up any trees 
left by the curbside and deliver them to a nearby recycling center. 
You&rsquo;ve got to love those Boy Scouts!<br>
<br>
 There are still proponents 
for both sides of the Christmas tree debate. But short of forgoing a tree 
altogether, the real trees are the best option when considered from an 
environmental perspective. So the best advice? Go to a local tree farm or lot, 
and have a great time picking out the family Christmas tree. Make a big deal of 
the event, possibly stopping for hot chocolate or cider somewhere on the way 
home. Once your tree is home, keep it well watered&hellip; and respect the 
&ldquo;three strand&rdquo; limit on joining strings of lights together. (Most 
Christmas tree fires are the result of overloaded electrical circuits, not dry 
trees.) And when the holiday season is over, make sure your tree is disposed of 
properly at a recycling center. This way your family Christmas tree can enjoy a 
second life... as mulch to help nurture and protect the next generation of 
trees.<br>

 I disagree with this article. First of all farmland 
and slopes do in fact support its own assemblage of shrubs and plants which in 
turn support organisms. Creating a mono-culture of balsan fir trees and 
inhibiting secondary succession isn't environmental friendly at all. It is true 
that these artifical trees would be detrimental to the environment because it 
isn't biodegradable but perhaps a better way around this problem would be for 
compaines to start creating their trees with no PVC and use other more organic 
ways of making christmas trees. Andrew David | 12/08/07 | 14:47 PM <br>

 What's more organic than growing a 
renewable tree in the ground on farms? No PVCs and 100% natural, if you ask me. 
And they smell nice. :)<br>

 Perhaps, but with more than a billion people 
worldwide harvesting trees for one day of the year.....and the fact that the 
article appears to forget that nutrient cycles don't work like watering a plant 
i.e. it takes a fair amount of time to occur. Also the monoculture aspect of 
the whole thing troubles me...at any moment some host specific beetle or virus 
could destroy the entire thing and hence a whole bunch of money goes down the 
drain. Andrew David | 12/08/07 | 18:55 PM <br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  Your primary concern seems not to be with the 
environmental impact on but is more geared towards economical aspects as stated 
in your last statement. I thought that this article did an amazing job with 
outlining both points of the argument and then stating which choice seemed to 
have the smallest amount of environmental impact. I would agree with it. PVC 
are cheap to manufacture. So I don't see China which produces 85% of our 
artificial Christmas trees switching over to a more environmentally friendly 
product when they can manufacture each tree for about 10 dollars. Don't fix 
that which is not broken. Also, China doesn't not have very high environmental 
standards. This is another reason I don't for see a change in that way. As to 
viruses and beetles wiping out populations, that happens all the time. Price 
just goes up for that year. No big problem. Also,most Christmas trees are 
harvested after 8-12 years and carbon sequestering occurs more rapidly in 
younger trees. The National Christmas Tree Association's website also has some 
more information on artificial trees as well as real trees.<br>

 This article 
was meant to compare the two options that most people currently consider around 
the holidays... an artificial tree or a cut real tree. Of those two options, 
the cut tree definitely seems to have a much lower environmental impact. But I 
do agree that there be other options out there. Buying a potted tree that can 
be planted in your yard after the holidays would be a fantastic alternative, 
assuming you live in an environment that will support such a tree year-round. 
Or stringing up lights on a tree already in your front yard as the family 
&quot;Christmas tree&quot;, while piling presents beneath a display of 
decorated evergreen boughs which could &quot;stand-in&quot; for an indoor 
tree... would be another way to celebrate with the look and smell of a real 
tree (without any trees actually being harmed!)<br>
<br>
 I do agree it would 
be great if they would find a way to create the artificial trees without the 
use of PVC and lead. But I still believe that even with the greatest of 
technologies, we would have a hard time creating something that is going to be 
more recycleable and resuable than an actual tree.<br>

They are 100% recyclable, our is very easy to assemble and last forever! We 
really enjoy ours - its fun, unique and planet safe. I grew up with cut trees 
and still miss them some time, but we are lucky enough to have them in our yard 
and decorate the outdoor trees and keep the inside one aluminum. We got ours at 
yuletideexpressions.com Definitely more expensive than pvc, but totally worth 
it.<br>

 Are those like the pink ones that they show at the

perfectly shaped triangles, in every color of the rainbow. (not saying that is 
what yours looks like, I just remember Lucy and her friends asking Charlie 
Brown to bring back an aluminum tree)<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  How can you say that aluminum trees are planet safe? 
There is always a waste product when it comes to manufacturing something. 
Aluminum manufacturing gives off 5.5 tons of carbon dioxide and 3,300 tons of 
perfluorocarbons per year. Not to mention tailings which are marginally 
economical but mostly just a huge waste product.<br>

artificial tree I did a few years ago -- I bought it for then-neighbors'

<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  Some of the comments above seem to indicate that the 
writers didn't get the gist of the article. I suspect they were written by 
people with an ulterior motive... &quot;I always have preferred artificial 
Christmas trees, but after reading this, I'm extra glad that our family always 
followed this tradition instead of using real trees. I'll be sharing your 
article with friends. Thanks!&quot; What?!<br>
<br>
 I digress. My question is, 
what should I do when I live in Southern California? Any tree farms here must 
be unsustainable, given that the natural climate is dry, dry, dry. Buying a 
real tree here is clearly not a good choice. And I'd rather not buy an 
artificial tree after reading the above article. I'd like to buy a potted tree, 
but I live in an apartment and have no place to plant it after the holidays.<br>
<br> Does anyone have any suggestions for types of indoor, potted trees that 
don't outgrow their pot too much, and that I can keep indoors all year?<br>
<br>
 Many thanks!<br>

<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  I work in a store that sells artificial trees and the 
author of this article does not have his facts straight. Most real tree fires 
are not from electrical overloads but because the tree didnt get enough water 
and the heat from the lights cause it to catch fire. Artifical trees do NOT 
contain lead, this is a myth. Some lightbulbs (not just christmas lights, all 
lights in general) contain a small amount of lead in the fuse, this is the lead 
that caused the myth to arise. This small amount of lead is sealed inside the 
fuse and cannot hurt anyone. Telling your kids not to touch the tree or to wash 
up after being near it is just absurd.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  Do a simple youtube search for this and you will see that 
some artificial trees do contain lead. CNN reported on it about two years ago. 
You can also look on the National Christmas Tree Association's website to find 
out about information about lead being in artificial trees. It is no myth. It 
just not in all of them. So people really do have to check for warning labels 
on the back of packages before they buy. It is not just in the light fuses it 
is in the hunter green paint that is on the lights. Check the CNN report, it 
will surprise you. Also, If a fire does start and gets going. the artificial 
tree will flame up just like the real trees. Even if it is flame retardant. 
Check the National Christmas Tree Association's website for this too.<br>

truly 'read' it.<br>
<br>
 It gave both sides of the debate very nicely - it is 
up to the reader to make a decision from the information.<br>
<br>
 Those who 
have got all uppity should probably go back through and re-read it...<br>
<br>
 
There were instances of tress containing lead some years ago and whilst these 
have been phased out, many people still have old trees that may have been 
connected to this scare. If Alex takes a second look at the article it should 
be apparent that the tips on washing hands etc are for those who own a tree 
they SUSPECT contains lead, it was not an all-encompassing piece of advice.<br>

 I agree with Jenny and Krissy. The article (which 
was written by a she, Alex) provides both sides of the debate, but some 
commenters' responses imply she came down on one side or the other. This is 
something I struggle with each year because I want to be environmentally 
friendly but I grew up with real trees and there's something about trekking out 
to a local tree farm, playing in the snow, picking out a tree to cut down, and 
having the whole house smell like Christmas. I really like the potted idea, but 
like Krissy I have no place to put it after the holidays. Can you donate potted 
trees to local parks? I imagine there are some insect transfer issues, like 
boats and public access and zebra mussels. Becky Jungbauer | 12/01/09 | 09:41 AM

<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  No one mentioned the fact that those who have allergies 
cannot have a real tree. Though my family strives to be as environmentally 
conscious as possible, we purchased an artificial tree a number of years back 
after several holidays spent with illness and asthma issues. It has made a huge 
difference in our health! Though we miss the tradition of going to the local 
farm and cutting down our own tree, we're much healthier and happier with our 
good ole artificial one! I did invest in an air-tight container to keep dust 
and mold out, though.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  I think this article was good about discussing both sides 
of the debate. I personally have an artificial tree for the purpose of easy 
decorating, not having to spend money each year on a new tree and having a 
consistent shape and density with which to work with. I love the smell of real 
pine so I buy fresh garland for my mantle and a fresh wreath or two to put 
around my house.<br>
 With that said, after reading this article I have come up 
with a brainstorm that I will definitely explore: an &quot;Artificial Tree 
Recycle Drive&quot;. As an interior designer, I have been trying to figure out 
a charity that I can participate in to give back to the community, while using 
my talents. There are many homeless shelters, soup kitchens, halfway houses, 
public health centers and less fortunate people who would be blessed by having 
a Christmas tree each year, lit with LED Christmas lights of course- using 90% 
less energy and lasting ALOT longer. This will help keep some of these 
artificial tress out of the landfills and will lift some spirits during a 
holiday season that can be depressing for some. Though this is a small 
contribution to our environment, I think every little bit will help- whether 
you stop buying artificial or donate your existing one to a good cause. I will 
search for a cause like this in my community and if it does not exist yet, I 
suppose I will work towards getting one started.<br>
 Thanks for the article!

 Amy, I think this is a fantastic idea!&nbsp; 
Sometimes we forget the other branch of conserving resources - there is 
recycling, but there is also reusing.&nbsp; I think that offering a service for 
people to donate their artificial trees to is a fantastic brainstorm.&nbsp; I'm 
sure that there are many that go without a tree that would be happy to have an 
artificial tree that another household does not need/want anymore.<br>
<br>
 
And this article was never meant to be the final word on which was the ultimate 
&quot;best&quot; choice.&nbsp; I think it's based on the needs and situations 
of each individual.&nbsp; If the only way you can have a real tree each year is 
to buy one that trucked from 1000 miles away, is that better than going to buy 
an artificial tree that you plan to use over and over for 15 years and then 
dispose of (or donate) responsibly?&nbsp; Not necessarily.<br>
<br>
 Just like 
everything, it's just best to have all the information - and then make an 
informed decision.&nbsp; We're all in this together after all.<br>
<br>
 Happy 
holidays everyone! Kimberly Crandell | 12/07/09 | 19:09 PM <br>

<li>Link</li> </ul>  Interesting...this is far from scientific. A lot of 
suppositions. Good info about the toxicity of some artificial trees, but this 
is a definite case for lifecycle assesment (LCA). You really can't tell which 
is environmentally preferable without a thorough and scientific lifecycle 
analysis. So anyone thinking this article is conclusive is mistaken.<br>

<li>Link</li> </ul>  I love of course a real Christmas tree. But we have a 
very nice artificial and we alternate every so often. It's a special treat to 
have a real tree. Sorry to say in our small town you can't get any really nice 
trees and they cost a fortune. But there is nothing like a real tree. One of 
these days I would like go and cut one down and bring it home. That would be my 
ultimate christmas. In Texas this is a little harder to do.<br>

sweep up pine needles.<br>
<br>
 The one we have now is three peices and the 
branchs fold out for display and up for storage - it also has 1000 led lights 
on it. So, half the decorating is done!<br>

<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  Great article. I grew up with a real Christmas tree every 
year and having an artificial one has just never felt right. Unfortunately, 
because I'm currently living in Uruguay with my family, getting a real tree 
isn't an option. They aren't farmed here like in the States. So, if we get a 
tree, it'll have to be an artificial one. But, I'll definitely be checking the 
label to see if it was made in China since so many products here are.<br>

 ''Interestingly, to compensate for the impacts 
of a Christmas tree, be it natural or artificial, one can offset the carbon 
emissions by carpooling or biking to work only one to three weeks per year, 
according to ellipsos. &ldquo;Knowing this, the most ecological choice between 
the natural and the artificial Christmas tree becomes anecdotal. Regardless of 
the chosen type of tree, the impacts on the environment are negligible if 
compared to other activities...''<br>

Period. If you want to be environmentally responsible, just don't do it. Go 
outside and enjoy the trees where they belong. There is no shortage, yet.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  If you choose to use an artificial Christmas Tree from 
the standpoint of it being more environmentally friendly, I think that you 
should really investigate where your artificial Tree is coming from, and 
consider the environmental impact of transporting you artificial tree to your 
local store. If your tree is coming from half way across the world, there is no 
way that it is more environmentally friendly as a tree cut down at a local tree 
farm.<br>
<br>
 As for potted trees, there are a couple of young men in 
Brittish Columbia who baought a tree farm, and will rent you a potted tree for 
the holidays. What they do is deliver your potted tree, before the holidays, 
and pick it up after new years, and re=plant them at their farm. This is the 
only farm like this that I've heard of, but I'm sure in the years to come it 
will be sure to grow, and maybe you can start this up in your community.<br>

potted rosemary tree. We were able to use ours in Vancouver quite nicely. Bring 
it in for the holidays, keep it watered and then put it back out on the deck 
after the New Year - and it smelled nice too!<br>

 You shouldn't Rik, the measurement is perfectly 
valid, since it does not carry a error estimate ;-)<br>
No, actually I agree 
perfectly with you, and I discussed this in arecent post. Here is what i wrote 
there:<br>
<br>

<blockquote> What I am trying to explain is that the answer to the question, 
for an experimental physicist, is not &quot;to see 100 Z decays to dimuon pairs 
we need to acquire an integrated luminosity of L = 134/nb&quot;, but rather 
&quot;to see 100 Z decays to dimuon pairs we need to acquire an integrated 
luminosity of<strong>about 130 inverse nanobarns</strong>&quot;. The second 
answer, thanks to the intrinsic inaccuracy which it contains, is -to me- 
actually more accurate!!! Remember this, because it is an important lesson:<em>
the uncertainty is more important than the measurement</em>. In the sentence 
&quot;about 130&quot; we make it clear that we are not serious about the last 
digit, and so we provide<strong>MORE</strong> important and accurate 
information than &quot;=134&quot;!<br>
<br>
Let me stress it again (and I will 
make it a &quot;say of the week&quot; one day): given a chance to either be 
given the result of a measurement without its uncertainty, or be told the 
uncertainty of the measurement without the value of the measurement itself, you 
should choose the second!<br>
</blockquote> Cheers, <br>

<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  Why even have a tree at all? Just a dumb tradition. My 
husband and I have both worked on Christmas tree farms in southwest va. in the 
past, and we have friends who grow Christmas trees. They ALWAYS use 
insecticides, chemical fertilizers, and roundup., whether or not they actually 
&quot;see&quot; the insect. It's just the norm to spray. My husband once 
sprayed insecticide for a farm. He had to be covered head to toe with vinyl 
suit and wear a mask. So, if it is so safe as some of you say, look up some of 
the chemicals that are used on Christmas tree farms. And of COURSE the 
Christmas Tree Grower's Associations are gonna make it look all 
&quot;green&quot;. I know a tree farmer less than five miles from my home that 
logged out a beautiful forest just to plant christmas trees. MONOCULTURE. Not 
good. Not like nature planned.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  You neglected to factor in two other points albeit minor 
ones:<br>
<br>
 One point for artificial trees: Allergies. My friend is 
allergic to pine trees so she has a four foot fake tree that she has had for 
many years.<br>
<br>
 One point against: Storage cost. A fake tree is nice 
price for multiple uses, but you also have to pay to store it. That should also 
be accounted for in the cost of a fake tree. Storage costs are often neglected 
when factoring the price of an object. Usually because storage costs are 
variable, but the cost is there even if we don't think about it.<br>
<br>
 
Neither for or against: My husband has a 2 foot tree (more like your toilet 
brush variety) that we include as part of our regular decorating that he has 
had since age 16. Some years when we just didn't have the means to get a real 
tree we still had that little tree. We pull it out to decorate before we get 
our &quot;official&quot; Christmas tree.<br>
<br>
 Funny anecdote: I helped my 
brother make a popcorn string for his first Christmas tree with his wife. On 
Christmas morning they discovered ants liked popcorn. When he took the tree out 
to the dumpster he immediately dove into the apartment complex's pool to wash 
the ants off. Real or fake, I would toss an ant covered tree too.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  I think we usually had fake trees but now that I found 
out about the lead, we went with a real one this year. I tested positive to 
many grass types in my allergy test as well as cats, dogs, seasonal, etc. Just 
a lot of allergies. Not sure if I tested for pine.<br>

<ul> 
<li>Reply to This &raquo;</li> 
<li>Link</li> </ul>  This article appears to have been prepared with a 
research bias, where more research was conducted into the effects of fake trees 
on the environment without researching the effects of real trees on the 
environment. For example this article fails to take into account the water 
consumed in the growth of these 'real' trees, water consumption is massive part 
of the environmental problems facing the earth today, its not just about gases. 
Also the article mentions that the 'an acre of Douglas fir trees can absorb 
11,308.7 lbs of carbon dioxide' but fails to take into account that this fact 
is worthless, you need to ask the question what happens after your finished 
with the tree, the answer is that it breaks down and release the carbon dioxide 
back into the atmosphere. The best tree is a potted tree that is alive but can 
be used for several years.<br>
