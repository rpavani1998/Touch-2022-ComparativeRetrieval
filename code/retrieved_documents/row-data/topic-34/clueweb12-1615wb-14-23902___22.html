<h1>Tree Care and Which is&nbsp;Better?</h1> Posted on December 5, 2011 by 
Garden Walk Garden Talk <br>

<h2>Tree Care First</h2> 
<p><strong><strong>If you are purchasing your tree for the very first time, 
here are some helpful hints to prolong its beauty and sustainability.</strong>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1.</strong> Since a tree can be placed to be seen from all sides or 
up against a wall,<strong>be sure the placement is in the best interest of the 
tree</strong>. Keep it away from heat sources, such as, fireplaces, heat vents, 
radiators, TV&rsquo;s and away from swinging doors.</p> 
<p><strong>2.</strong> Make sure your tree can<strong> fit on the car for the 
ride home</strong> and in your house once it is home. Too big is not the best 
choice.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>3. Research your tree</strong>. Some hold needles far longer than 
others, so it may depend when you what to erect your tree for longer durability.
</p> 
<p><strong>4.</strong> Select a fresh tree without excessive needle loss. Some 
interior loss is to be expected and occurs on trees still planted firmly in the 
ground. And, when you take it home,<strong>keep it out of the sun and wind in a 
cool location</strong>, such as an unheated porch or garage.</p> 
<p>Then, when you decide the time to decorate is right, <strong>make a one 
inch cut</strong> at the base of the trunk and place it in a bucket of warm 
water. Bring it inside after the tree soaks up the water. Once inside, place it 
in the stand full with water.</p> 
<p><strong>5.</strong> Always keep the stand full with water. <strong>A seal 
of sap will develop if the tree is without water for more than four hours
</strong>, necessitating you to re-cut the base of the tree. Avoid all this 
work. Keep the stand full of water. The tree will absorb more than a gallon the 
first day and one or more quarts thereafter.</p> 
<p>Water keeps the needles from dropping and helps the tree to retain the 
fragrance.</p> 
<p><strong>6. Recycle your tree</strong>. Or, place the tree in the yard with 
suet. The birds will thank you for the fancy dinner and lodging.</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<h2><strong>Which is Better, Real vs. Artificial</strong></h2> 
<p>So what number 6 brings up is the question of, <strong>&ldquo;Is a real 
tree really an eco-friendly choice to make?&rdquo;</strong>Well, this easily 
understandable chart below, from theNational Christmas Tree Association, though 
biased is probably accurate.</p> 
<p>Artificial trees are generally made from non-renewable plastics of 
petroleum-based products. People may argue that artificial trees last a 
lifetime, but most are thrown away within ten years to remain in landfill sites 
for a very long time. My first tree lasted twenty years. Hooray for me.</p> 
<p>I have also read that since the artificial tree lasts on average of ten 
years, subsequently they have a smaller carbon footprint overall than a farm 
raised tree. I guess I should be giving equal time to theAmerican Christmas 
Tree Association, sponsoring the artificial tree industry. They do have some 
salient points as well.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But my friends at the farm may scoff at my bringing them up here, but hey, 
I own five fake trees and use them each year too. I am an equal opportunity 
debater. Just kidding, but both sides have great points, although I have to 
side with the real trees overall.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The National Christmas Tree Association simply charts the difference 
between Real vs. Artificial Trees. One thing the charts omits is convenience 
and simplifying the holidays. Hands down Artificial Trees win this one, 
especially the new pre-lit trees. That is my biggest gripe about real trees. I 
am the one stringing and positioning lights. Bah humbug.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And here is another point often overlooked. Many of the presents under the 
tree have been made or assembled overseas and the same may also be true of the 
artificial tree that stands over them, but what about the stand that both real 
trees and artificial trees sit in? Made in China?</p> 
<p>Also many of our real trees are trucked clear across the country to 
neighborhood corner lots, not locally grown. Hey, this argument can go both 
ways, so it is important for you, the reader, to consider all the facts when 
making your purchase, and determine on your own the validity of these claims.

<p><strong>There are benefits to purchasing a farm grown tree</strong>, not 
least of which is supporting local growers like my friends atErway&rsquo;s 
Christmas Tree Adventure.</p> 
<p>The trees are recyclable. Many municipalities offer a recycling programs 
through their parks departments and provide convenient curbside pickup. Some 
communities will offer a service to chip your tree into biodegradable mulch, 
which can be used for gardens and kid&rsquo;s play lots.</p> 
<p>If your tree is chipped, make sure to allow the chipped matter to sit for a 
year and decompose. Used immediately, the chipped tree will need nitrogen by 
the microorganisms to enable the decomposition process and this will remove the 
nitrogen from the soil for your plants.</p> 
<p>Whole trees are used on beaches in areas prone to shore erosion for 
prevention, which I have seen, and in lakes, streams and ponds to provide 
habitat and feeding areas for our aquatic life, which I have only read about 
but makes great sense.</p> 
<p>Real trees grow back, artificial trees do not reproduce on their own, at 
least not from a seed anyway. Seeing them come off the assembly line makes you 
kinda wonder though. It does look like an alien invasion with them reproducing 
almost spontaneously, marching down the line.</p> 
<p>North American forests cover about the same area of land as they did 100 
years ago. In the last decade, the forests have expanded by nearly 10 million 
acres. I read these facts somewhere in trade literature, so again it may not be 
completely accurate. For every tree harvested, up to three more are planted on 
tree farms to ensure a renewable supply for generations to come.</p> 
<p>This I have seen first hand as my friends three tree farms grow and expand.
</p> 
<p>Consider helping the reforesting by buying and planting a potted Christmas 
Tree this year. Even a little Alberta Spruce can one day grow to 8 feet like 
mine in my back yard after 15 years. This little baby was one I decorated for a 
Christmas present for a client. It is now over four feet tall. Here, it is only 
eighteen inches.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My concolor was such a tree. A little potted cutie. See it above with two 
little artificial trees in 2009? I made and painted the big bow. That is my 
office decorated as a big lighted package.</p> 
<p>Granted when the Concolor gets to be eleven feet tall, it will be my indoor 
tree, but by selectively pruning, it has remained shrub size for many years and 
has lived in my front yard festively decorated for the holiday.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And they are just so darn cute at this age, you just want one like when you 
see a puppy and go awe&hellip; But remember, they need special care and can not 
be in the house for more than week; keep the house cool too.</p> 
<p>The real problem is that the trees are settling in for winter and dormancy 
or a slowing down occurs. Fluids slow, but do not stop in conifers. But tender 
buds do get the idea spring is coming as the tree warms inside the home, and 
this damages the tree when it is put back outside.&nbsp; Also the tree dries 
very quickly too. So the less time indoors the better.</p> 
<p>And get your hole dug early before the ground freezes. You will have to 
have your new live tree healed in for winter.</p> 
<p>Plus, think about you carpets and floors. Trees need water and the growers 
pots are usually fiber pots, like you see above, and will leak through. Have a 
BIG saucer underneath while your tree anchors you holiday decor.</p> 
<p>Real trees grow by taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and 
releasing clean oxygen back into the environment. Artificial trees, NOT. And 
who can argue clean oxygen as a byproduct.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>Artificial Grand Fir</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Real Grand Fir</em></strong></p> 
<p>Real Trees have tradition and great childhood memories. You don&rsquo;t see 
photos of kids jumping up and down in glee at the sight of presents piled under 
an artificial tree much before 1960 when many of these memories were born. But, 
then again traditions change and many of us have memories under a shiny silver 
tree too.</p> 
<p>Artificial trees will look Martha Stewart perfect year after year. But not 
being perfect is what makes a real tree unique and aesthetically pleasing. From 
a designer point of view, not being perfect is better. That is my main 
aesthetic objection to artificial trees, it is like making everything 
symmetrical in a space. Just boring.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Well, I ( and the National Christmas Tree Association and the American 
Association of Christmas Trees) have left you with much to think about, and I 
know there is a lot of other points to make both pro and con for both sides, 
but, I love real trees at Christmas, and since I have been working with the 
wonderful hardworking people at the farm, and seeing the new little trees 
planted each year, I feel much less guilty about my choice. I still do cringe 
when watching my tree fall, but I know the replacement tree is only a 
springtime away.</p> 
<p>See Green Apples, The Buck Stops Here for some pretty photos of the deer at 
the farm. The kids are feeding the does too!</p>

<p>What a wonderfully researched post. You&rsquo;ve made good points for 
either choice but I admit I&rsquo;m a real tree gal and will never look the 
other way. I&rsquo;m very fortunate though as I&rsquo;m able to buy my 
Christmas tree from a local grower and we are also provided with free tree pick 
up from home for chipping. It makes the choice a no brainer.</p> <br>

<p>You are lucky to have the pickup. Our city does it too and if we want 
mulch, I think we can get it from them. Many local communities have a yard for 
residents to get mulch. I felt I had to make a case for both trees, since I 
have both every year.</p> <br>

<p>You did it, Donna, what a great post! All the arguments both pro and con in 
one easily read package. Live trees are the essence of buying local. They 
preserve open space from development and keep family farms in business. Not to 
mention that getting them is an experience to treasure, which doesn&rsquo;t 
compare with getting the fake one from the attic. I can&rsquo;t imagine having 
to dust my tree&hellip;..Carolyn</p> <br>

<p>Thank you. I know most like the real trees, as do I, but I have always had 
the artificial trees too. Like when I visited my mom at Christmas, I had no one 
to care for a real tree. They come in handy and who could afford multiple real 
ones?</p> <br>

<p>When I read the title, I thought &ldquo;are you kidding?&rdquo; Real! 
Every. time. I will always have a real tree. Even if I have to set aside money 
to pay someone to go buy me one, decorate it and come take it down.</p> <br>

to mention them. </p> <br>

<p>I have an artificial tree. When it comes to pesky pets, especially my 
naughty cats, artificial is better since they like to nibble on foliage and 
dunk their paws into any saucer of water. They also like to climb inside the 
tree, but they don&rsquo;t have as easy of a time with metal as compared to 
wood that they can sink their claws into. It would be a never ending battle to 
keep them off a real tree.</p> 
<p>Still, it would be nice to have a real tree. I&rsquo;m considering 
purchasing an adaptable live tree from a local nursery. My only gripe with the 
selection is the lack of fragrance. Ah well&hellip; One definite advantage of 
having a real tree is storage. Artificial trees are a pain to store.</p> <br>

<p>Dear Donna, This is the BEST article I have read about Christmas trees. You 
did not miss anything out! I learned some new information&hellip; My daughter 
wonders why her balled tree doesn&rsquo;t survive when planted. Now I can tell 
her it may be because she keeps it in the house too long. I have a real tree 
and a very small artificial one. I love this tradition and love your post!

<p>I&rsquo;d like to have both a real tree and an artificial tree and a potted 
one to plant on the ground after the season is over. Nice to start a tradition 
of happy memories for the future. Imagine a growing tree as a daily reminder of 
all the goodness of Christmas spent with loved ones.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Donna, I find it really hard to decide on where to stand in the real 
vers artificial Christmas tree dilemma. You make some very good points here. I 
had no idea that most people only kept there artificial tree for 10 years. I 
find it scary to think about all those fake trees clogging up landfill sites.
<br> We have an artificial tree, but I love the fresh smell of a real tree in 
the house. Some years it is nice to have the special treat of a real tree.</p>

<p>Excellently researched post, Donna. We don&rsquo;t really use live trees 
locally. Mostly I think because our pines don&rsquo;t have that 
&ldquo;christmas tree shape&rdquo;. The cut, live trees used locally are still 
shipped from overseas! Too, with the tropical weather, even in Christmas, the 
trees easily dry up. Not good in a country where Advent seems to be the start 
of the Christmas season and not the season before Christmas. My wife did go 
eco-friendly last year and so we had potted Araucaria in the of the living room 
and dining room and outside. This year, the Araucaria are still in their 
original pots but are outside by the driveway gate. An artificial tree is in 
the living room which now looks much more &ldquo;Christmas-y&rdquo; than last 
year. I wish I could show you the difference through pictures. Your trees look 
wonderful, BTW.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Donna &ndash; I love REAL Christmas trees &ndash; they take me back to 
my childhood when artificial trees were just &ldquo;Not done&rdquo; in my 
parents&rsquo; home. I too prefer a real tree but have not had either real of 
fake for the last ten years because my cat can&rsquo;t resist pulling the 
decorations and whole tree down! So last year we tried an eco-friendly 
cardboard type tree and he pretty much ignored it, so we might be ready to try 
a tree again &ndash; of course it would have to be a real one </p> <br>

<p>I just wanted to add to my previous comment that I learned the hard way 
about the tree forming a crust if out of water for more than 4 hours. I did 
that two years ago and the tree never sucked up another drop and went brown. 
Last year I was much more diligent and finally took the tree down at the end of 
January even though it looked like it was just cut. The owners of our tree farm 
keep their tree up until Easter.</p> <br>
