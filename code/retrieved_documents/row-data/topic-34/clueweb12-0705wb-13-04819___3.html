<h3>How About a Green Christmas?</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>I absolutely love the holidays, but I&rsquo;m acutely aware of how wasteful 
this time of year can be. In fact, I just read aNational Geographic News 
article that stated that Americans produce 25 million tons of &ldquo;festive 
rubbish&rdquo; every year&mdash;yikes! And that doesn&rsquo;t even take into 
account all the energy wasted illuminating holiday lights, all the fuel 
consumed shipping gifts, and all the money spent on said gifts. What&rsquo;s an 
eco-conscious person to do?</p> 
<p>Here are some easy ways to make this Christmas a little greener and still 
have fun&mdash;no Grinches here!</p> 
<p><strong>Trees.</strong> When I was an apartment dweller, real trees 
weren&rsquo;t allowed, so I bought a fake one at an after-Christmas sale. 
It&rsquo;s still got a few years of use left in it, so I&rsquo;m going to keep 
assembling and taking it down until it croaks. Then I&rsquo;m switching to real 
trees, because fake ones can have some pretty nasty ingredients in them, such 
as PVC and even lead. Plus there&rsquo;s the environmental impact of 
manufacturing and shipping the trees. If you purchase a fake tree, make sure 
it&rsquo;s a sturdy one that will last for quite some time so it&rsquo;s worth 
the impact on the environment.</p> 
<p>Are real, cut Christmas trees more your style? If so, look for organic tree 
farms near you or ask around for vendors of sustainably grown trees in your 
area. And read up onSierra Club&rsquo;s tips for buying and giving holiday 
trees.</p> 
<p>Better still, buy a living Christmas tree that you can plant once the 
holiday is over. Learn all about the benefits of buying balled and burlapped 
trees for planting later fromthis article. (If the ground isn&rsquo;t frozen in 
your part of the country yet but it might soon, dig a hole for your live tree 
now!) Or buy small trees or tree-like potted plants that you can decorate for 
the holiday and keep around all year&mdash;that&rsquo;s what my mom did last 
year, below, and it was adorable!</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Lights.</strong> String energy-efficient LED holiday lights 
indoors and out. (They&rsquo;re now available in most places where standard 
holiday lights are sold.) LED lights come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and 
colors and, in addition to lasting a lot longer than standard Christmas lights, 
can reap big energy savings for your home. Or go solar with these holiday 
lights fromGaiam.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Decorations.</strong> It&rsquo;s simple. Make your own. You 
can easily create your own wreaths, ornaments, and other d&eacute;cor. Or just 
decorate less. A festive candle here, an organically grown Christmas tree 
strung with LED lights there, stockings you made yourself hung by the chimney 
with care &hellip; what more do you really need?</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Greetings.</strong> If you&rsquo;re sending holiday wishes 
this year, how about e-cards rather than print ones (which inevitably end up in 
the landfill, no matter how witty your prose). Or if you insist on 
old-fashioned greetings (they are fun to give and receive, aren&rsquo;t they?), 
look for cards made with recycled paper.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by ReProduct greeting cards and envelopes&mdash;the 
cards come in two-way envelopes (sort of like Netflix) with pre-paid return 
postage to Shaw Industries. When the recipients finish with the cards, they 
stick them in return envelopes and drop them in the mail. Shaw uses 100 percent 
of the cards and envelopes to create carpet backing for new carpet tiles. Cool, 
huh?</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s one more idea worth trying: send natural holiday cards that 
come embedded with seeds. Once spring rolls around, the recipient can plant the 
whole darn card, water it, and watch as flowers or even trees sprout from the 
ground. Try Green Field Paper&rsquo;sGrow-A-Note cards or pretty plantable 
paperworks fromBotanical Paperworks.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Gifts.</strong> Buy fewer, more meaningful gifts. Or consider 
making donations to recipients&rsquo; favorite charities instead. If you 
can&rsquo;t get out of the gift-giving cycle, buy local to support your 
community&rsquo;s economy and cut down on the fossil fuels used for packaging 
and transportation. And check out Treehugger&rsquo;sgift guide for eco-friendly 
ideas for everyone on your list.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Parties.</strong> I absolutely love throwing holiday parties. 
Every year I get my girlfriends together for a fete at my place, during which 
we overindulge in homemade treats and tasty drinks, listen to Christmas music, 
and catch up. But there&rsquo;s always room to go green.</p> 
<p>This year I&rsquo;m going to say no to disposable plates, cups, and 
silverware. If you don&rsquo;t have enough glass dishes for your party, pick up 
an assortment from Salvation Army or ask a friend to loan you some. And if 
you&rsquo;re dreading cleaning all those dishes, enlist some help. With a glass 
of wine and your closest friends or family members armed with dish towels by 
your side, it&rsquo;s not so bad!</p> 
<p>During the party, also be sure to set out bins or bags for recycling paper, 
aluminum, glass, and such. (Just be sure you label the recycling 
clearly&mdash;last year my paper recycling bin ended up filled with 
chocolate-covered strawberry tops!)</p> 
<p>For more eco-friendly holiday decorating and entertaining ideas, head over 
toThe Decorating Diva.</p> 
<p>Keep reading the blog this month too, because there are plenty more 
festive, green tips to come&mdash;next week I&rsquo;ll fill you in on green 
gift-wrapping ideas, then later in the month I&rsquo;ll highlight the best ways 
to recycle that lovely Christmas tree (if you can&rsquo;t plant it).</p> 
<p>(Oh, and if it&rsquo;s too late to implement some of these green tips this 
year, don&rsquo;t despair! That&rsquo;s what bookmarks are for, so you can come 
back and try these pointers out in 2008!)</p>
