 Artificial vs. Real Christmas Trees <br>
&nbsp;
<br> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The neighborhood Christmas tree lot and its newly cut pines may soon be a 
rare sight if a new national study is correct about the artificial 
competition's rising popularity. A decline of 36 percent was reported for real 
tree sales - according to the National Christmas Tree Association, sales 
dropped from 32 million to 23.4 million between 2000 and 2003.</p> 
<p>Nine million artificial Christmas trees were sold in 2004 according to the 
Association, up from 7.3 million in 2001. On average, an artificial tree lasts 
about six years. A fake tree on the Internet runs anywhere from $100 to $1500, 
a real tree at Home Depot costs from $25 to $50. For many families, cutting 
down a Christmas tree is an annual tradition. A real tree also adds something 
to Christmas that a fake tree can't: a scent.</p> 
<p>Putting up and decorating Christmas trees is a time-honored tradition, and 
many families are faced with choosing between artificial and real trees each 
year. Here are a few things to remember when choosing which type of tree would 
be best suited for your needs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&nbsp;Artificial trees remove the hassle of having to choose a tree from 
the lot.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Another good thing about artificial trees is that they do not need 
to be watered and the needles will not drop off and make a mess in your house.
</li> 
<li>&nbsp;The cash you save by buying an artificial tree can be spent on more 
gifts for your family or perhaps other types of decoration.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Fake trees won't bother you if you are allergic to the smell of pine.
</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Fake trees can't rot like real trees can.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Artificial trees are easy to assemble and store away.</li> </ul> 
<p>In 2005 El Pasoans said they had seen less lots compared to years past. A 
more handy, safer and cost effective version may have taken their place. The 
Home Depot in that community reported a rise in the sale of prelit artificial 
trees. They said the Friday after Thanksgiving they ran out of trees and had to 
order more. Experts also say fake trees are safer because many of them are fire 
retardant.<br>
 Artificial Christmas trees can be set up much earlier and left 
up longer. Buying artificial helps prevent the cutting down of a live tree. 
Artificial trees are safe and flame retardant. Coarse needles will never prick 
you; so artificial trees are easier to decorate. The needles on your artificial 
tree will never shed. Artificial trees have a fuller, classier look. They also 
last for years, which makes them more economical.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you really need a real tree to decorate your living room? Is it right to 
cut down a living tree just because it looks and smells better?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are a variety of arguments for and against buying a live or an 
artificial Christmas tree. Indeed, there are good and bad things about each 
type of tree. Here are the pros and cons of each:</p> 
<p><strong>Live Christmas Trees</strong></p> 
<p>Pros:</p> 
<p>Fresh scent<br>
 Lots of unique selections to choose from<br>
 The 
traditional choice<br>
 Take in carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse 
gases and release fresh oxygen into the air.<br>
 Christmas tree farms help 
sustain the rural economy and provide jobs<br>
 Another tree is planted for 
each one harvested to ensure a steady supply year after year</p> 
<p>Cons:</p> 
<p>Need Constant maintenance<br>
 Can become a fire risk if not correctly 
maintained<br>
 Shed needles<br>
 Can only be left up for a limited time<br>
 
Less economical<br>
 Transporting the tree and disposing of it after use can be 
difficult</p> 
<p><strong>Artificial Christmas Trees</strong></p> 
<p>Pros:</p> 
<p>More cost-effective <br>
 Flame retardant<br>
 No maintenance necessary<br>

 Can be left up for as long as you like<br>
 No mess from needles <br>
 Huge 
assortment to select from</p> 
<p>Cons:</p> 
<p>Can look phoney and synthetic <br>
 Made from a non-renewable resource: 
petroleum<br>
 There is no advantage to the home economy, as a lot of fake 
trees are made abroad<br>
 Time required to assemble the tree<br>
 Requires 
storage space in the home<br>
 Insects may get into the carton while it is 
stored if not packed properly</p>
