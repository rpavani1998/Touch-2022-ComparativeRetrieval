<h1>Forget about Valentine's Day, it's all about the green spring clean!</h1>  
ByElisabeth Edvardsen on February 14, 2012 Comments (0) Share Tweet <br>

<p>Valentine's Day will come and go, and we like to think that people 
celebrate their love each and every single day rather on a day made popular by 
a greetings card company to sell more cards...</p> 
<p>February is halfway through; spring is hopefully around the corner (unless 
we get another cold snap!) so why not start planning how to spring clean your 
home in the most green way?</p> 
<p>Commonly used leaning products are known to contain lots of nasty things 
that you really don't want your children/animals/skin to get in touch with. So 
why not invest in products that will help you feel good and care for the 
environment?</p> 
<p>If you don't feel like making your own cleaning products (think hot water, 
vinegar, baking soda and a hint of lemon),Ecover's ecological selection of 
products is a good place to start as they are made from plant-based ingredients 
that will leave no nasty residues or irritants on your skin. Also, all their 
bottles and containers are made from Plant-astic, a renewable, reusable and 
recyclable plastic derived from sugarcane - Ecover is the first cleaning brand 
in the UK to manufacture its bottles from this material.</p> 
<p>But spring cleaning is not just about the products. There are plenty of 
other things that will help you tidy up your house, all ready for the new 
season.</p> 
<p><strong>Reduce </strong>the mess in your home. Go through places where 
'things' tend to accumulate - closets, the top shelf of the kitchen cupboard, 
the attic, under your bed, and anywhere else you're likely to have stored items 
that will be 'dealt with later'.</p> 
<p><strong>Reuse </strong>anything you can. An old bed sheet can be made into 
several dishcloths. Got lots of books that have no home? Stack them up next to 
your bed/sofa for a unique side table.</p> 
<p><strong>Donate </strong>unwanted things to charity. Because you don't have 
any use for that old jacket or the kitchen pans, chances are someone else will. 
So carry anything you don't want to your local charity shop and help them as 
well as helping yourself. For bigger items, list them onFreecycle and see if 
anyone wants to take them off your hands. The more you can recycle and donate 
the less ends up on the skip!</p> 
<p>Happy cleaning! Got any tips on how to green spring clean your home? Please

<p></p> 
<p>With tales of cold Arctic winds possibly hitting the British Isles in the 
next few weeks and winter just around the corner, you're probably considering 
how to keep your house warm over the coming months. Making sure your place is 
properly insulated is a given but what about your radiators?</p> 
<p>It might be too late for this season, but if you're considering swapping 
your boring old white radiator for a more stylish design - yet want to make it 
energy efficient - let us introduceBisque. This is Italian design at its best 
but with an eco twist!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The new generation of aluminium Bisque radiators for 2012 are made from 
re-cycled aluminium and are the first radiators to combine sleek Italian design 
with energy efficient technology.</p> 
<p>With a low water content - using 85% less water than your standard radiator 
- Bisque aluminium radiators take a shorter time to heat up and cool down, 
meaning they use less energy to heat your flat and respond to changes in 
temperature faster. So not only are they more energy efficient, they may also 
lower your bills!</p> 
<p>The Blok and Ellisse ranges are available in the Bisque London Showroom now 
and nationally from February 2012. Blok is priced from &pound;514.80 and

<p></p> 
<p>IBTimes brings to our attention today the Bio Natura mattress, offering a 
healthier kip. It's designed by Israeli bedding companySapapa by Aminach who 
don't mess about, apparently, when it comes to a good ol' slumber courtesy of a 
quality mattress. Aminach actually translates to 'My People Rest' - if you 
insist!</p> 
<p>The Bio Natura is an all-natural mattress made of 100% premium cotton and 
pure coconut fiber, featuring an orthopedic center that increases the mattress 
life and prevents the middle from caving in.</p> 
<p>Most significantly though, it swears to be free of any harmful chemicals 
which means your body won't be exposed to as many toxins whilst your snoring 
the night away.</p>

<h1>Summer gardening: The importance of bees</h1>  By Elisabeth Edvardsen on 
June 9, 2011 Comments (71) Share Tweet <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Summer is fastening its grip yet again, the flowers are in bloom and people 
appear to be much happier - amazing what some sunshine and warm weather can do!
</p> 
<p>With flowers also come bees and as you are preparing your garden for the 
summer season it could be worth keeping the humble bumble bee in mind. While 
you might want your garden to look fashionable with large and colourful plants, 
it's important to remember that bees, and other insects, live in your 
flowerbeds and these amazing looking plants can be &quot;hostile&quot; towards 
insects making it difficult for them to access the pollen and nectar. If you 
are an avid gardener check outThe Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) 'Perfect 
for Pollinators Plant List' to find out which plants and flowers are best for 
the insects that live on your plot of land.</p> 
<p>Many of the UK's 24 bumble bee species are today endangered - two species 
even became extinct in the last 70 years! You can do your bit by choosing 
plants that have this new 'bee label' - it's shaped like a bee - that indicate 
which flowers and plants are best to help bees and butterflies.</p> 
<p>All bees are vital to our food chain, in fact one third of the food we eat 
would not be available was it not for the keen workers. The economic value of 
honey and bumble bees as pollinators of commercially grown insect pollinated 
crops in the UK has been estimated at over &pound;200 million per year! (
www.bbka.org.uk)</p> 
<p>Bees are in danger of disappearing, and while you can ensure their 
continued well-being by planting the right flowers you could also consider 
taking up beekeeping. Honey bees are under attack from the varroa mite and only 
treatment and care provided by beekeepers can keep their colonies alive.</p> 
<p>However, to keep bees you need some equipment - some to keep you safe when 
handling the bees - and also a hive for the bees to live in. There is a wide 
choice of hives available on the market, but we particularly like this cute'Bee 
Station' on Eco Age that is designed to support British bees!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Produced by a pottery in Stoke-on-Trent, the Bee Station is described as a 
&quot;bee refuelling and nesting site that sits on your flowers bed&quot;. The 
design is spacious enough for two species of bee to nest for their full 
fourteen weeks and holes for sugary drink to provide sustenance. And it will 
look great in your garden too!</p> 
<p>For more information on how to keep honey or bumble bees visit The British 
Beekeepers Association website.<br>

<h1>B&amp;Q loft pod - environmentally friendly and simple to install?</h1>  By
shinychris on May 12, 2011 Comments (2) Share Tweet <br>

<p></p> 
<p>DIY chain B&amp;Q reckons it has created one of the UK's most 
environmentally friendly properties with a revolutionary new type of loft 
conversion.</p> 
<p>Its 'loft-pod', which uses NASA technology, has been brought to a humble 
end of terrace in Eastleigh to create a sustainable home. What's more the 
instant loft conversion took just half a day to install.</p> 
<p>The loft was built off site in 21 days and delivered early in the morning 
as the B&amp;Q Innovation experts got to work. A crane was used to lift the 
loft into position as residents looked on and by the end of the day the home 
had gained an extra room.</p> 
<p>Rooms in a pod could be available to homeowners of the future as such new 
build techniques prove to be easier and faster than current industry practice 
(though presumably the cost of hiring a crane etc wouldn't be cheap).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The converted loft came fully wired, insulated and painted with B&amp;Q's 
recycled Home Eco Paint. The roof has Photo Voltaic panels so that the house 
can produce its own hot water. As well as the loft-pod, the house received a 
pre-made garden-pod which is the energy hub of the home.</p> 
<p>With the combination of NASA space technology and expert design, the new 
loft and home of the future plays host to a range of unusual products that 
B&amp;Q claim will be the norm in years to come in a bid to create sustainable 
homes. This is the first time such technology has been combined under one roof, 
making it one of the greenest houses in the UK.</p> 
<p>Blinds similar to the NASA Space Shuttle have been used on all of the 
single glazed windows as they keep more heat in than any triple glazed window. 
The wall insulation is also a lot thinner than most homes in the UK, as 
technology from cruise liners has been adopted to make the house virtually 
sound proof.</p> 
<p>As well as underfloor heating, the house boasts skirting boards which also 
act as radiators. Heat is pushed out through the boards to keep whole rooms at 
a constant temperature. By the time the house is completed, it is estimated 
that it will have reduced its carbon output by at least 80 per cent.</p> 
<p>So far the build is 40 per cent finished with a new roof constructed, and 
under floor heating installed. The designs for the kitchen and upstairs 
bathroom have also been finalised and the house is set to be habitable by July. 
The house will then be open to the public to see what the home of the future 
looks like.</p> 
<p>The transformation of the home came in the same week as the Government 
announced that it is to offer homeowners a &pound;10,000 loan to help create 
eco-homes across Britain. B&amp;Q is just one of the retailers which is in 
talks with the Government to discuss the opportunities surrounding the Green 
Deal and can offer insight into how the deal might work, as it has just 
completed a similar trial in the London borough of Sutton.</p> 
<p>The Council-run trial included B&amp;Q providing an energy audit of homes 
to locate which changes would reduce both carbon output and bills, followed by 
a loan from the Council which is then paid back over 25 years. B&amp;Q then 
supplied the product to get the job done.</p>

<p>Former England and Manchester United footballer Gary Neville has finally 
been given the green light to build his new partially underground pad.</p> 
<p>The eco-friendly house has been in the plans for a long time, as the 
36-year-old has spent more than a year battling to win planning permission.</p> 
<p>Gary will now start building the flower-shaped property - which has a 
striking resemblance to the set of popular kids' TV show Teletubbies - on the 
grounds of his &pound;8 million estate. It will have four bedrooms, a 
children's play area and a swimming pool - all nicely located in its petals.</p>
<p>We wonder if MTV cribs will want to visit environmentally aware Gary 
Neville's home when it's finished. We applaud you for fighting for it Gary!<br>

<h1>Solar power on private homes is latest craze in Britain</h1>  By Elisabeth 
Edvardsen on April 28, 2011 Comments (11) Share Tweet <br>

<p>Remember when we wrote about solar panels and the benefits of installing 
them on your house? Now it appears that householders are rushing to put exactly 
that on their roofs! (They must all be loyal Hippyshopper readers)</p> 
<p>According to guardian.co.uk, government subsidies have tripled the amount 
of solar power in the UK over the past year as people, largely homeowners, look 
to make nearly &pound;1,000 a year as a result of installing solar panels.</p> 
<p>This is most likely a result of the introduction of feed-in tariffs (Fits) 
last year, which pay individuals and businesses for generating green energy.</p>
<p>Are you planning on installing solar panels to your roof?</p>

<h1>Benefits of installing solar panels on your house</h1>  By Elisabeth 
Edvardsen on April 1, 2011 Comments (7) Share Tweet <br>

<p>Have you been thinking about installing solar panels on your house to 
produce your own energy? If you haven't you definitely should, because the 
benefits of solar electricity are many:</p> 
<p><strong>It will cut your carbon footprint</strong>: it is a green, 
renewable energy source that doesn't release any harmful CO2 or other 
pollutants. A standard home solar panel system could save around 1 tonne of CO2 
yearly.</p> 
<p><strong>Your electricity bills will be slashed</strong>: sunlight is FREE! 
So once you've invested in a system, it could help cut your electricity bills 
with 40%.</p> 
<p><strong>You can make money of it</strong>: yes that's right. If more 
electricity than you need is produced you can sell it back to the Grid.</p> 
<p>You don't need planning permission for most solar electricity systems as 
long as they're under a certain size, but check with your local planning 
officer before you invest in one.</p> 
<p>Also ensure you have a nice sunny roof or wall to fix it on, as there is no 
point having the panels if the sun doesn't reach them.</p> 
<p>And most importantly, once you've got your solar panels installed and 
ready, invest in some energy efficient appliances that will help you maximise 
the electricity that is produced!</p> 
<p>Installing a solar panel system will set you back around &pound;12,000 + 
VAT (The Energy Saving Trust). But there are also some companies that offer 
free solar panel systems in return for a cut of your income. Read more about it 
onthe Energy Saving Trust's website.<br>

<h1>Top tips for saving energy at home</h1>  By Elisabeth Edvardsen on January 
12, 2011 Comments (11) Share Tweet <br>

<p>With news that several energy providers going to increase their electricity 
prices, it's time to have a look at how you can save energy - and money - at 
home. It doesn't take much to save a little here and there, and in the long run 
all small energy savings can help you reduce outgoings - and it is greener too!
</p> 
<p>Take a good look around your house or flat and note down where energy might 
be wasted on a piece of paper - that's your to-do list. Now you can reduce your 
energy usage in workable steps, and not get overwhelmed by everything that 
needs to be taken care of. First do something about obvious energy wasters (no, 
that doesn't include the cat that does nothing else than sleep on the sofa and 
eat): leaving the light on; heat escaping through the windows; a flat as hot as 
a sauna. Then work your way through the to-do list towards a more energy 
efficient home life.</p> 
<p><strong>Top tips for saving energy </strong></p> 
<p>1. Is your home hot as a sauna? Turn your thermostat down. Reducing your 
room temperature with only 1&deg;C could cut your heating bills by up to 10%. 
Put any saved money towards your next holiday or a girl's night out.</p> 
<p>2. Wear slippers and add another layer of clothing before you turn up the 
heat.</p> 
<p>3. If you can, set your heating on a timer to go on an hour before you have 
to get up in the morning and off when you actually get up. The flat will then 
slowly cool down, and you'll be out the door before it cools completely! Do the 
same in the evening. Heating on for a few hours, and let the flat start to cool 
down 30 mins before you go to bed.</p> 
<p>4. Check all windows and doors for drafts and place draft excluders 
wherever possible. Make it more fun by making your own unique draft excluders! 
If you don't have double glazing, invest in thick curtains that you can close 
at dusk to stop heat escaping.</p> 
<p>5. Always leaving your TV / Kinect on standby, or laptop and mobile phone 
charging unnecessarily? This actually draws more energy than you may think, and 
will add up over the months. Flip the switch and you could end up saving pretty 
pennies.</p> 
<p>6. Turn off lights when you're not in the room, and use energy saving 
lightbulbs wherever possible.</p> 
<p>7. Love a cup of tea? Only boil enough water to fill the cup or cups of tea 
you're making.<br>
 If you like feeling toasty once in bed, swap the electric 
blanket for a hot water bottle and wear socks to bed.</p> 
<p>8. Set your fridge and freezer to the right temperature. Not too cold and 
not too warm, just right as Goldilocks would say. Defrost food in the fridge 
overnight instead of microwaving it.</p> 
<p>9. Only wash clothes when you have enough for a full load. Two half-loads 
uses more energy than one full load. And line dry whenever possible.</p> 
<p>10. Towel dry your hair as much as possible. This will cut down the time 
you need to use your hairdryer for.</p>

<h1>All I want for Christmas 3 December: a real Christmas tree</h1>  By 
Elisabeth Edvardsen on December 3, 2010 Comments (0) Share Tweet <br>

<p>I don't know about you, but for me there is no Christmas without a real 
Christmas tree. And it seems like many of you out there may agree, as over six 
million real trees are bought every year in the UK.</p> 
<p>A real tree doesn't only bring holiday cheer into your house; filling each 
room with a delightful scent; it also many other positive uses.</p> 
<p>Christmas trees provide a great source for production of oxygen, each acre 
of trees producing enough oxygen for the daily need of 18 people! Also if you 
buy your tree from a certified BCTGA grower you can be certain they are 
sustainably grown and haven't caused any damage to local wildlife. And with the 
growing availability of potted or rented trees, you don't even need to cut one 
down - simply chose which one to get, and either plant it in your garden after 
Christmas or send it back to the farm until next season.Read more about how to 
best care for your real tree and recycling here.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, London received its annual Norwegian Christmas tree for 
Trafalgar Square, and today theBCTGA are delivering a 16ft tree to 10. Downing 
Street - a tradition that has been going for over a decade. Now it's up to 
Prime Minister Cameron and his helpers to decorate it beautifully.</p>

<h1>The Greener Option for Christmas Trees</h1>  By Elisabeth Edvardsen on 
November 23, 2010 Comments (2) Share Tweet <br>

<p>With Christmas Eve just one month away, and the British Christmas Tree 
Growers Association (BCTGA) warning of a Christmas tree shortage, it is time to 
think about which tree to get: real or fake?</p> 
<p>Over six million real trees are bought every Christmas, manifesting 
Britain's unceasing love for the real thing. However, there has been an 
increase in the popularity of artificial trees over the years as they last 
season after season, as well as offer a solution to the 'needle drop' problem.
</p> 
<p>But when choosing whether to go for a real or a fake tree it is important 
to put your eco hat on and consider: which is most environmentally friendly?</p>
<p>Despite offering a quick solution that will last for years, most artificial 
trees are made of metal and plastics, and have been transported from the Far 
East. Most fake trees are also non-bio degradable, and are likely to end up 
cluttering some landfill for centuries after having been discarded for a newer, 
more fashionable version.</p> 
<p>You may argue that real trees get cut down and also end up on some landfill 
come January, but being a bit eco savvy there are great options out there for 
those wanting to do their bit for the environment while still enjoying all that 
the festive season can offer.</p> 
<p><strong>Why root for British grown Christmas trees?</strong></p> 
<p>Christmas trees provide a great source for production of oxygen, each acre 
of trees producing enough oxygen for the daily need of 18 people, and for every 
tree cut this season at least one more will be planted in its place. All BCTGA 
growers subscribe to a code of conduct that ensures their crops are sustainable 
and do not cause damage to the local wildlife.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the greener options?</strong></p> 
<p>Choose locally grown Christmas trees that have been cultivated in a 
sustainable manner (visitwww.christmastree.org.uk to source). If this is your 
choice, don't buy the tree earlier than 1st December to ensure that it keeps 
for the length of the festivities.</p> 
<p>If the idea of cutting a tree down is unbearable, buy a container grown 
tree and replant it in January. If looked after properly, it could end up 
bringing Christmas cheer to the household for years - and perhaps save a couple 
of pennies too!</p> 
<p>Alternatively, there are many rent-a-tree companies, like Trees for Rent, 
popping up these days to help make Christmas as eco-friendly as possible. 
Simply place an order via the website, wait for the tree to be delivered, keep 
it over Christmas and then watch it go back to the field it came from once the 
festive season is over. For as little as &pound;35 a tree can be your year 
after year.</p> 
<p>However, if you would rather do-good than buy a real tree, check out urban 
tree planting charityTrees for Cities to buy a gift that will keep on giving. 
Their green gifts are sustainable and will make a real and lasting difference 
to UK communities and around the world. Choose between an apple tree in Addis 
Ababa or an ice cream tree in Peru for &pound;10, or give children in urban 
areas a tree-mendous experience trough Trees for Cities' community greening 
projects for as little as &pound;15 .</p> 
<p><strong>Give your tree a bit of TLC</strong></p> 
<p>If opted for the real thing, keep in mind the tree is a living object that 
needs some tender loving care in the weeks it embellishes your house. Keep the 
tree in water (or the pot) outside until you're ready to bring it indoors, 
where it should be placed away from direct heat and keep watered throughout the 
season - it will drink at least a quarter of a gallon of water each day.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember to recycle</strong></p> 
<p>Hippyshopper readers of course know the importance of recycling, but 
unfortunately only 10% of real Christmas trees are recycled each year. This is 
truly a shame as there are so many great options available.</p> 
<p>Last year, 33 London boroughs offered Christmas tree recycling schemes. 
Visit theRecycle for London website to find your nearest Reuse and Recycling 
centre.</p> 
<p>Outside of the capital, local authorities, as well as DIY retailers and 
garden centres, offer recycling services. Look onwww.recyclenow.com to find 
your local tree collection points.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, if you have a garden, place your tree outside and let 
animals inhabit there, or chip it to create mulch that can be used around other
