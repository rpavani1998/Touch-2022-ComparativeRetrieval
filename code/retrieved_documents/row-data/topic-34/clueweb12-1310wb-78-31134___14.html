<h3>Make Christmas a fun DIY activity</h3> Thursday, December 30th, 2010 
<p>With just a little planning anyone can give a Christmas present which is 
original, thoughtful, recycled and home-made. It can even be one that will make 
a small difference to the environment. Giving gifts at Christmas is a tradition 
which has been passed down for generations. It is not just about how much money 
has been spent, it is also the time and effort put in that makes a gift special.
</p> 
<p>There really is nothing like making a Christmas present, putting a bit of 
&ldquo;love&rdquo; into it and then seeing the recipient break into a smile 
when they discover what is hidden behind the ribbon and recycled paper. There 
is a wealth of wonderful things to cook, craft, sew and even grow for that 
green Christmas of giving.</p> 
<p>Knit a tea-cosy and add some organic tea, some embroidered napkin holders 
and a tablecloths. A patchwork table runner and place mats will make any table 
setting look beautiful. Some people will find the thought of making Christmas 
gifts a waste of time, but for others it&rsquo;s a yearly routine which can 
save money too.</p> 
<p>After another year of financial uncertainty, many households are looking at 
ways to cut the cost of Christmas, it may be setting a smaller budget, or 
choosing less commercialised presents and instead going for more imaginative 
ones. Taking a DIY approach to Christmas presents can be fun and money can be 
saved, this is money which can be used on heating bills orhousehold insurance.
</p> 
<p>A popular gift is a cake stand as this can be made using upturned tea cups 
and can be made for next to nothing. Another idea is to make a large Christmas 
cake, then cut pieces from it and make mini Christmas cakes which can be 
individually decorated. These can then be put into home-made hampers for family 
members and can also include home-made jams, chutneys, even home-made truffles 
and assorted candies can be made at a much reduced cost. There is no end to 
what can be done, from infused olive oils to cakes, which will be as 
pleasurable to receive as they are to make.</p> 
<p>Hand-made gifts do not have to look cheap; there are many websites that 
offer advice on how to do it. Gift sets in shops make ideal presents but you 
can easily group different items together, or pick and choose items for smaller 
presents if you are less confident about fabricating things on your own yet are 
keen to offer original gifts.</p>

<h3>How to not over decorate the home at Christmas</h3> Wednesday, December 
22nd, 2010 
<p>Every neighbourhood has one or two houses with so many Christmas lights 
that it looks more like a spaceship than a Christmas celebration. Whether it is 
because they simply love lights and outdoor decorations because it makes them 
feel happy or they are in a competition with their next door neighbour is 
difficult to tell. There end goal is the same, to get their house noticed. 
Whatever the reason it is possible to be the envy of your street without going 
overboard.</p> 
<p>If you have a mansion, then having a thousand lights on the outside of the 
home may well be the correct amount. For the rest of us, a thousand lights are 
just too many, not to mention how much electricity will be used during the five 
weeks they are on. Never overload any socket with all the extra plugs required 
for the lights. If they are not in a surge protector, it may mean a claim on the
<strong>household insurance</strong> policy if a fire starts. A good idea is to 
think of the home as a picture from a child&rsquo;s book. Colour the lines, but 
not everything in between; sometimes it really can be a case of less is more. 
Too many Christmas items will draw everyone&rsquo;s eye away from detail and 
make the picture of the home blend into a blur. Accent the house to draw 
friends and visitors eyes to the stand out areas.</p> 
<p>Pick a colour scheme, remembering that not every colour has to be used. 
Multi-coloured lights are fine to use and are better than solid strings of 
coloured lights. Complementary colours which enhance one another, rather than 
competing against each other are the way to go. Also, consider what effect 
blinking the lights will do. It is true that blinking lights are fun, but too 
many of them will become distracting for anyone looking at the home.</p> 
<p>Not everything in the garden needs to be decorated. Just because it is 
there does not mean it has to have a string of lights wrapped around it. 
Decorating for Christmas doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated or expensive. The 
simple touches are often the most elegant and the ones that receive the most 
comments. Remember, if you have children, get them involved as they will love 
both helping and the end result; making the home stand out and ready for a 
visit from Father Christmas.</p>

<h3>Council of Mortgage Lenders report holds no Christmas cheer</h3> Friday, 
December 17th, 2010 
<p>If the latest report from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) is to be 
believed, then 2011 is not going to be much of a year for homeowners looking to 
sell their property, or indeed for prospective buyers looking to get on the 
housing ladder.</p> 
<p>The CML&rsquo;s final gloomy report for 2010 did nothing to cheer up 
homeowners, home seekers or estate agents. Although their forecast is that 
nothing will change too much from the stagnation of 2010, they anticipate the 
Government&rsquo;s action in pulling the plug on support schemes such as the 
Support for Mortgage Interest benefit, which was introduced by the last Labour 
Government when the recession was at its height, will certainly tip some 
homeowners over the edge and into repossession.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In all they anticipate repossessions to increase by about 4,000 to a yearly 
figure of 40,000 and they predict mortgage owners in arrears to go from 175,000 
to 180,000. This they say will be down to the cut in government support.</p> 
<p>With banks and building societies expected to keep their strict borrowing 
requirements in place, the CML anticipate no more than 860,000 house purchases 
to go through in 2011. The figure is slightly less than 2010 and down once more 
to the difficulty first time buyers are having in finding a mortgage that is 
viable. The great disappointment though for buyers in general, is that they can 
see bargains in the estate agents shop window but can&rsquo;t do anything about 
it. The CML though, have noted that they expect house prices to remain stable 
in 2011 partly because homeowners with property&rsquo;s for sale are digging 
their heels in and refusing to drop their prices any more.</p> 
<p>It does seem that unless there is a sea change in the policies of the 
lenders then the buoyancy of the housing market that many in the UK thought 
would last forever, may have disappeared for the short term future at least. It 
would be interesting to see just how many of the house purchases last year 
resulted in a quote for landlord insurance rather than<strong>household 
insurance</strong> as the buy-to-let market does at least seem to be holding 
its own.</p>

<h3>Protect the home from cold winter weather</h3> Tuesday, December 14th, 2010
<p>The signs are that the winter of 2010 is going to be cold&hellip;very cold! 
Some parts of the United Kingdom have had temperatures close to -20C and even 
the big cities have regularly dropped below freezing. With icy conditions and 
more snow on the way, are our homes a warm and safe place for us to hibernate 
this winter?</p> 
<p>Insurance firms are warning that everyone needs to winter proof the home. 
An unwanted plumbing bill due to a burst pipe or a defunct boiler could not 
come at a worse time with Christmas just around the corner. Although many 
household insurance policies will provide cover for some damage caused by 
emergencies, everyone should have full protection against all potential winter 
hazards.</p> 
<p>Not having cover for your heating and hot water boiler is nothing less than 
folly really. If the worst happens and the boiler is a write-off, it will take 
a substantial sum to replace the boiler, even a small breakdown will leave you 
with a cold and miserable house until you find a tradesman to cure the fault. 
Of course he will have to be paid too. Some insurers will include cover in a 
home insurance policy, paying for call-out charges, some labour costs, parts 
and materials. With others extra cover can be added to a policy which will pay 
for call-out charges, labour costs, parts and repair to the domestic heating or 
water system.</p> 
<p>Check to see if the roof has any loose or missing tiles. If it does, get 
them fixed before the winter weather gets any worse. Make sure all the gutters 
are clear from any blockages. A build up of water on the roof can lead to leaks 
and may even cause damage to the structure of the property. It is also a good 
idea to check the seal around the windows and that the doors have no gaps.</p> 
<p>Cold and icy weather means that there is a risk of pipes freezing, then 
bursting and flooding the home. This can be prevented by repairing any cracks 
which may let in cold air and insulating the pipes properly. Even something as 
simple as making sure that everyone in the home knows where the stopcock is so 
it can be turned off quickly in the event of an emergency can be vital.</p> 
<p>Finally, make an emergency winter survival kit so that the household will 
be prepared if the worst happens. It is a good idea to have a torch, some 
candles, some blankets, tinned food and a first aid kit. Ensure everyone in the 
home knows where the kit is located. Always keep a copy of the<strong>household 
insurance</strong>All sizes Sweet Home #2 Flickr &ndash; Photo Sharing! policy 
to hand as well as a phone number for an emergency plumber and electrician.</p>

<h3>Should a Christmas tree be real or fake?</h3> Friday, December 10th, 2010 
<p>December means that Christmas trees will be appearing in homes throughout 
the country as families prepare for the festive period. Expensive gifts that 
need to be covered by a<strong>household insurance </strong>policy will be 
placed under trees all over the UK. We are in an age when we are all being 
asked to be aware of the impact each of us has on the environment. So is it 
best to buy an artificial tree which can be used year after year, or go in 
search of the perfect living tree and make it the centrepiece of the Christmas 
decorating?</p> 
<p>An artificial tree does offer long-term use for any Christmas tree 
decorating needs. And unlike many years ago, the current generation of 
&ldquo;fake&rdquo; trees do not look that bad. In the past artificial trees 
really did look fake but today, until getting really close, it can be hard to 
distinguish the artificial trees from the real thing, except of course for the 
wonderful smell that is given off by a real tree.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With money being short for many households an artificial tree can in the 
long run be easier on the wallet. For the same cost of a single large live 
tree, it is possible to buy an artificial tree which looks the same and comes 
with the added bonus of lasting several festive seasons. A fake tree will come 
in a box and does make one job that much easier, no more driving to several 
tree stockists before either putting it on the roof rack or squashing it into 
the car and driving home. So if they look the same, cost less, can be used year 
after year, and they also prevent a living tree from being cut down. Should we 
all not be lining up to buy an artificial tree?</p> 
<p>Artificial Christmas trees, which have become increasingly popular during 
the last decade, actually have a carbon footprint which is at least ten times 
bigger than a real tree. A six foot fake tree, which is made from plastic will 
be damaging to the environment and is equal to toasting over 5,000 slices of 
bread or driving for 120 miles in an average sized car. Whereas a real tree of 
the same size will create carbon emissions which are the equivalent of toasting 
only 418 pieces of bread and driving under 10 miles. While cutting down a 
living tree may not sound the most environmentally friendly thing anyone can 
do, it actually appears to be the &ldquo;greener&rdquo; choice. This is because 
it is not so much about how many times a person can use the tree. It is more 
about what the tree is made of as well as what it does to the environment in 
its life cycle.</p>

<h3>Planning permission should not be ignored</h3> Wednesday, December 8th, 
2010 
<p>When carrying out home improvements it is vital to do your groundwork 
correctly. Some improvements will require planning permission and it is also a 
good idea to let the neighbours know about any work that you intend to 
undertake. Your neighbours are likely to be concerned about any work which may 
affect them and the enjoyment of their property.</p> 
<p>A well-designed building or extension is much more likely to be attractive 
and it will also add some value to your house. The insurance company should be 
told of any improvements made so that they can update the all important<strong>
household insurance policy</strong>. Examples where planning permission may be 
needed include adding or extending a flat or maisonette, dividing off part of a 
property for use as a separate home, using a building in the garden as a 
separate residence for someone else, building a separate house in the garden or 
dividing off part of the property for business use. Lighting itself, and minor 
light fittings, are not subject to any planning controls. However, if the plan 
is to install external lighting for security, make sure that the intensity and 
direction of any lighting will not disturb anyone.</p> 
<p>It is possible to make certain types of minor changes to a home without the 
need to apply for planning permission, these include fitting an alarm or 
putting up a wall or a fence which is below a certain height. Patios and 
driveways or also exempt. Other projects that can be carried out as long as 
they meet certain important criteria are conservatories and having a loft 
conversion. If you build something which needs planning permission but without 
getting permission first, you may be forced to put things right later, which 
could prove troublesome and costly. If you are in any doubt, contact the 
planning department of your council.</p> 
<p>The success of any planning application will depend greatly on the quality 
of the application which has been submitted. If it is the first time planning 
permission has been applied for, it is highly recommended that an agent is 
employed to make sure everything is correct. They will complete the planning 
permission application form and look at any building regulations. A good agent 
will take away a lot of the hassle involved. The use of an agent will mean 
paying a fee, but this is often money well spent. An agent will have experience 
of working in this area and will also have a good knowledge of local 
regulations and policy and quite often understand the council and what they 
will expect from any development. More importantly an agent will make the 
completion of a planning application form straightforward. If the forms have 
been completed incorrectly it means that valuable time is wasted.</p>

<h3>Go back in time with cottage style d&eacute;cor</h3> Friday, December 3rd, 
2010 
<p>Cottage style is not just a decorating theme; it is also a lifestyle where 
people choose the country charm over modern life. English cottage style 
decorating will look as if it has come straight out of a Jane Austen novel, but 
it will make the home look beautiful.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reinventing the home from 
inside to capture the essence of English cottage style d&eacute;cor can be done 
by using some ingenuity and also having some fun. Pick a colour scheme from the 
array of pastel colours for cottage decorating. Choose from green, yellow or 
pink which would all set the tone for beautiful d&eacute;cor. Creating a cosy 
and comfortable space is the basic d&eacute;cor concept ideas to be sought, and 
a hardwood floor with matching rugs will complement the room.</p> 
<p>English style windows should allow the light to enter the room properly. 
Choose some gorgeous lace curtains instead of heavy drapes. Fabrics for the 
upholstery, bed sheets and curtains need to be made of floral prints that match 
the pastoral setting. Go for soft lighting to brighten a room. Vintage lamps 
can be easily found at an antique store or try to convert an old item such as a 
vase or jug in to a table lamp.</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
 English country cottage style furniture was simple and 
rustic. Choose a large sofa and a simple quaint table. For a real English 
country style look add some antique picture frames. The setting would not be 
complete without an afternoon tea set. Therefore, make sure the kitchen 
cupboard has some fine chinaware and a teapot. Remember that<strong>household 
insurance</strong> is as important in a cottage style home as it is in any 
other.</p> 
<p>Try to keep the whole d&eacute;cor as simple as possible to enhance the 
beauty of the home. Some pine furniture will play an important role in the 
cottage style or if you can get some wicker furniture it will be all the 
better. Add some handmade accessories to give a finishing touch.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Wicker baskets can be used for hanging plants. Fresh flowers and wooden wall 
hangings are the best pieces to achieve the cottage style look. English cottage 
style d&eacute;cor is becoming one of the more popular decorating styles, and 
it&rsquo;s no wonder as its light and breezy style is well suited to 
today&rsquo;s lifestyles. Contrary to what the name implies, it can be used in 
any type of home, not just a cottage. Even a three-bedroom home in the city can 
have the ambience of a cute cottage if the d&eacute;cor is designed correctly.
