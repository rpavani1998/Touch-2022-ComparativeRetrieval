<b>Dear EarthTalk: What&rsquo;s 
better for the environment, a fake or real Christmas tree?</b> <br>
<i>-- R.M. 
Brandt, Nutley, NJ</i> 
<p> While there is no crystal clear answer to the age-old &ldquo;real versus 
fake&rdquo; Christmas tree debate, most environmentalists, &ldquo;tree 
huggers&rdquo; among them, would agree that real trees are the better choice, 
at least from a personal and public health standpoint. Some might make a case 
for fake trees, because they are re-used every year and thus don&rsquo;t 
generate the waste of their real counterparts. But fake trees are made with 
polyvinyl chloride (or PVC, otherwise known as vinyl), one of the most 
environmentally offensive forms of non-renewable, petroleum-derived plastic.</p>
<p> <b>Fake Christmas Trees and Cancer</b><br>
 Furthermore, several known 
carcinogens, including dioxin, ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride, are 
generated during the production of PVC, polluting neighborhoods located near 
factory sites. Most of those factory sites are actually in China, where 85 
percent of the fake trees sold in North America originate. Labor standards 
there don&rsquo;t adequately protect workers from the dangerous chemicals they 
are handling.</p> 
<p> <b>Fake Christmas Trees and Other Health Problems</b><br>
 In addition to 
PVC, fake trees contain lead and other additives designed to make the otherwise 
rigid PVC more malleable. Unfortunately many of these additives have been 
linked to liver, kidney, neurological and reproductive system damage in lab 
studies on animals. TheChildren&rsquo;s Health Environmental Coalition warns 
that fake trees &ldquo;may shed lead-laced dust, which may cover branches or 
shower gifts and the floor below the tree.&rdquo; So heed the advice of the 
label on your fake tree, which tells you to avoid inhaling or eating any dust 
or parts that may come loose.</p> 
<p> <b>The Drawbacks of Real Christmas Trees</b><br>
 The primary downside of 
real Christmas trees is that, because they are farmed as agricultural products, 
they often require repeated applications of pesticides over their typical 
eight-year lifecycles. Therefore, while they are growing--and then again once 
they are discarded--they may contribute to pollution of local watersheds. 
Beyond the run-off issue, the sheer numbers of trees that get discarded after 
every holiday can be a big waste issue for municipalities that aren&rsquo;t 
prepared to mulch them for compost.</p> 
<p> <b>The Benefits and Care of Live Christmas Trees</b><br>
 The most 
eco-friendly way to enjoy a Christmas tree is to buy a live tree with its roots 
intact from a local grower, and then replant it in your yard once the holiday 
has passed. However, since trees are dormant in the winter, live trees should 
spend no more than a week indoors lest they &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and begin to 
grow again in the warmth of your home. If this happens there is a good chance 
the tree will not survive once it is returned to the cold winter outdoors and 
replanted.</p>
