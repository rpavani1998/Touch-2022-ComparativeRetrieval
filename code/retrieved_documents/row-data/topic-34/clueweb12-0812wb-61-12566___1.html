 Some users have been automatically 
suspended from all Google services.halilgokdal <br>

<p>A fresh storm has blown into Google&rsquo;s new Google+ service. The 
company has beensuspending accounts because they contravene Google&rsquo;s 
Community Standards &ndash; ostensibly to stop fake or spam accounts being 
created.</p> 
<p>This means any name Google has determined is not the person&rsquo;s real 
name has resulted in an automatic suspension.</p> 
<p>The suspension has also, in some cases, removed access to all other Google 
services, including email.</p> 
<p>Exactly how many users have been affected by this action is not known but 
it is enough to have mobilised Google+ users to voice their displeasure.</p> 
<p>One of the more high-profile suspensions was of Limor Fried, also known as 
Ladyada or Adafruit Industries.</p> 
<p>Fried was recently featured on the front cover of Wired magazine with an 
article in that issue about DIY electronics.</p> 
<p>In addition to selling electronic kits, her business&rsquo;s website 
features videos which show how to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; electronics to do 
everything from creating a remote that switches off any television, to creating 
glowing cufflinks from Apple Mac power buttons.</p> 
<p>After a brief outcry, Fried&rsquo;s account was reactivated with no 
explanation. Others, it seems, have not been so fortunate.</p> 
<h2>Say my name</h2> 
<p>The issue of enforcing &ldquo;real names&rdquo; is a contentious one on the 
internet. In South Korea, for example, there&rsquo;s a policy requiring all 
users of sites that allow online comments to be identity-checked.</p> 
<p>Google, along with many other internet companies, bowed to this policy on 
its sites, including YouTube, and blocked people from uploading videos unless 
they had verified their names.</p> 
<p>Facebook also courted controversy recently when the company closed the 
account of a Chinese commentator calledMichael Anti and told him he needed to 
use the name on his Chinese Government ID card.</p> 
<p>The irony of this is that, allegedly, Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s dog has a 
Facebook account under an alias (yes, this is the real case of &ldquo;on the 
internet, nobody knows you are a dog&rdquo;).</p> 
<h2>Mixed identity</h2> 
<p>Like all things, the argument is not simple. Governments and services will 
argue that using a Real Name policy will help cut down spam,internet trolling) 
and general bad behaviour.</p> 
<p>But there are many legitimate reasons for using a pseudonym or 
&ldquo;non-de-plume&rdquo; that are mixed in with people&rsquo;s profession, 
identity and safety.</p> 
<p>The issue quickly escalates to one of suppression of free speech and, as 
such, makes its enforcement one more example of companies trying to create an 
internet that is, in essence, simply commercial.</p> 
<p>Another difficulty that Google, in particular, faces with the 
implementation of this policy is that it does so using a computer program that 
uses an algorithm to determine what is real and what is fake.</p> 
<p>Google&rsquo;s reliance on automating these decisions is bound to lead to 
indiscriminate mistakes. Given this can then lead to an automatic suspension of 
your email account with no warning, the consequences are severe.</p> 
<p>This is especially the case with the UN&rsquo;s recent declaration that 
internet access is ahuman right.</p> 
<p>Companies such as Google and Facebook face an ongoing public relations 
juggling act between achieving their commercial goals and providing a service 
supporting a major social infrastructure.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, it will always be about business, so discussions 
about Google&rsquo;s apocryphal mantra &ndash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be 
evil&rdquo; &ndash; are moot.</p>

<p>Good article. You could have spent more time going into the suicides and 
assaults of people who have been tracked down after online arguments. It seems 
this site and many of it's users do not understand why anonymity can be 
important online. In these days where potential employers/clients check your 
facebook before your resume, online anonymity is the only way to maintain a 
separation between one's private and professional lives. Many people may be 
willing to wear their politics on their sleeve as a badge of honour, but all 
people who are posting on this site are announcing to the world where they 
stand on certain issues (not only that, those snooping you will not have the 
context of a conversation, so you will not get to defend or explain your words).
</p> 
<p>Frankly, my views on climate change and feminism have no impact on how I do 
my job, but they are issues that inflame emotions and have the potential to 
cause me to be looked over for a contract.</p> <br>

<p>There are real reasons to keep your identity secret online; real world 
ramifications. We've already got one user here stating they've been told 
they've missed out on a job because of opinions expressed online. There are a 
multitude of cases of real world physical violence that has played out because 
of disagreements online. This is not facebook, I can't block people from 
viewing my words. I also can't stop people from being prejudiced. I also cannot 
comment on a political website *without being political*.</p> <br>

<p>You can refrain from commenting. There are plenty of alternative online 
outlets where you can express your opinions under a pseudonym. I assume users, 
like me, post on The Conversation because we like the system here, we have more 
respect for opinions delivered under real names and we have some distrust for 
voluminous opinions delivered anonymously. Respect for us, and the site's 
owners, and its contributors, requires you to accept the same terms and 
conditions that we have, or to shift to a site more accomodating to your 
concerns. I'm not in a place to enforce the rules, but I would like to 
respectfully, politely request that you honour them.</p> <br>

<p>I hope you all realise that nobody is forcing you to use google+ or even 
any of their e-mail services. There are alternatives if you want to be 
anonymous; for instance, just stick with Facebook, why would you move to 
Google+ if you don't like their terms and conditions? Similarly, nobody is 
forcing you to comment on this article. TheConversation, from what I 
understand, is largely reliant on people being upfront about their identity, 
their credibility and any conflicts of interest they may have. Thus, posting 
with an alias makes this goal very difficult to achieve.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of places where you can be anonymous on the Internet and I 
am quite certain they will continue to exist. For the true anonymous experience 
just head on over to 4Chan.</p> <br>

<p>The issue is even more insidious as the automated systems that Google uses 
to find accounts that are not 'real' names have a very Western idea of what is 
a name. This means that a Native American for instance is more likely to be 
asked for government issued ID than say Robert X. Cringely, the pseudonymous 
tech blogger.</p> <br>

<p>I'm someone who has explicitly been told that I didn't get a job because of 
my online persona. Now that's not because there are compromising pictures of me 
or that I've done anything illegal, just the usual venting and frustration that 
goes with political activism...</p> 
<p>So I'm conflicted about this. </p> 
<p>I know that there are large PR companies who swamp comment threads and 
Facebook - and doubtless now Google+ - with fake opinion about climate change 
etc etc. That needs to be reined in, but how do you do that if you allow 
pseudonyms and anonymous sign ups?</p> <br>

<p>How do you police it without requiring people to register an internet 
identity? Not to mention I could just bounce through a proxy and look like I'm 
coming from a country that doesn't require me to register. Much like the 
internet filter, it's an idea that would only block innocents from innocent 
content; those who want to circumvent the system will do so with ease. Just 
look at the socks created by Tobacco lobbyists to rally against the plain 
packaging laws (if you don't know about that, look into these new &quot;All 
Pregnancies Must Be Registered&quot; ads and thetruthdective blog; the truth 
detective is a Tobacco lobbyist).</p> <br>

verify that the name entered &ldquo;Doctor Popular&rdquo; is your common name.

<p>Please reply to this email with either a copy of your government issued <br>

we can review your appeal and come to a final decision.</p>
