<h3>  Every Place Has Its Decoration, and Every Decoration Has Its Place, Just 
Not After Christmas </h3> Why is it that after Christmas, once your Christmas 
tree has been placed beside the road and the decorations have been safely 
stowed away in you garage, you can never return your living room to the same 
decorating state that it was in before? Last night, I attempted to do just 
that--put everything back where it belongs--and failed miserably. I know why; 
it was those stupid plants that I brought back with me. I decided over 
Christmas that it would be more beneficial to me both health and market-wise to 
replace my few remaining artificial plants with real ones. All those &quot;Sell 
This House&quot; type of shows swear that real plants show better, and I know 
that they're better for the environment. A lot of plants, like the spider one 
that I stole from my mom, clean the air. The only thing a plastic plant does is 
steal its dust.<br>

<p>You would think that returning my living room to its pre-Christmas glory 
would be as simple as replacing the fake plants with the real ones. Oh, if it 
only was. You see, I got another bright idea over Christmas as well--repot my 
cacti. They were formerly in a cactus rock garden, but, seeing as they haven't 
grown an inch since I got them, I decided that the rocks were doing more harm 
than good water-wise. Consequently, I painstakingly dug out the cacti and 
placed them in several decorative pots Wednesday morning. Now the pots of cacti 
are lined up next to the bathroom andkitchen sinks because I don't know what to 
do with them.</p> 
<p>In addition, I can't remember for the life of me where this one vase and 
this one candlestick came from. I know that I had them on display. I just can't 
remember exactly where. I've been tempted to go online and look at the pictures 
that my real estate agent took of my place when she took over the listing 
months ago, but I haven't done it yet. I don't think that it would do any good. 
I'm pretty sure that I rearranged my accessories after she took the pictures.
</p> 
<p>I know that I'll figure out the room's configuration eventually. Even if I 
never remember where everything went, I'm sure that I can put my art minor to 
good use and come up with a new configuration that's equally as pleasing. 
However, if my house still hasn't sold by next Christmas and I'm still living 
here, I'm taking a picture before I drag out the first Christmas decoration. 
Apparently, it will last longer than my memory.<br>
