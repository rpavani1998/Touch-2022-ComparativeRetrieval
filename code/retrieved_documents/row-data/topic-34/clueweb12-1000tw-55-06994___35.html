<h1>Are you on the fast track to Zero&nbsp;Waste?</h1> Posted on March 13, 2012
<br> Reply <br>

<p><strong>Changeworks Recycling&nbsp;excels at helping&nbsp;businesses to get 
serious about&nbsp;reducing their&nbsp;waste, cutting their costs and complying 
with Zero Waste legislation.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>We asked Angela Dolan, our very own business recycling 
expert,&nbsp;to explain the landscape that Zero Waste solutions&nbsp;function 
in&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>When spending time with people of a lesser environmentally-conscious 
disposition, it pains me to admit I normally shy away from eulogising about 
being canny when it comes to waste and recycling.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s 
face it, nobody wants to be on the receiving end of those rolling eyes or that 
glazed gaze of boredom.</p> 
<p>And so this poses the question &ndash; does it <em>really</em> matter if we 
chuck all our rubbish in the bin, sending it off to some Landfill-land far, far 
away?</p> 
<p>Firstly, landfill sites don&rsquo;t exist in some vacuous other-worldly 
place.&nbsp; Chances are there&rsquo;s alandfill site near your home or perhaps 
even the school that your kids go to.</p> 
<p>Landfill sites are &ndash; at their worst &ndash; exuding unfriendly gases 
and ridden with rats.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re loath to believe me, stop and check 
one out next time you&rsquo;re passing.</p> 
<p>This alone is a strong case to minimise our waste sent to landfill.&nbsp; 
But more than that, landfill capacity is neither limitless, nor are our natural 
resources.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ve still got to live our lives, togo forth and 
multiply, to develop as society &hellip; right?</p> 
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;ll enable us to continue successfully evolving 
is to make best use of the resources we&rsquo;ve got,for example, energy.&nbsp; 
This can be through loads of specific activities but it all centres around one 
main concept &ndash;minimising waste.</p> 
<p>Minimising waste is fundamental to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Zero 
Waste Plan which has set ambitious targets to secure Scotland&rsquo;s future in 
becoming a Zero Waste nation come 2025.&nbsp; Seems like a long way away?&nbsp; 
Perhaps &ndash; but demands will be upon us before we know it and this is 
especially true for businesses who happen to produce 85% of our country&rsquo;s 
waste*.&nbsp;New laws and regulations will seriously alter the way Scottish 
businesses manage their waste and they are coming into effect next year.&nbsp; 
For example, businesses producing or serving food will be required to remove it 
from their general waste stream for recycling so that heat and energy can be 
extracted.&nbsp; Also businesses will be required to source-segregate 
recyclable materials like paper, cans, plastic, cardboard, glass and so on.</p> 
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s help and support to inform businesses about the 
changes to legislation.&nbsp; For example,Zero Waste Scotland is hosting a 
series of workshops.&nbsp; If you are a Small to Medium size Enterprise,you can 
book your place to their next workshop held on 21 March at the Apex 
International in Edinburgh.</p> 
<p>Every business in Scotland should be asking the question, &lsquo;what is my 
waste management provider doing<em>right now</em> to ensure I will comply with 
the upcoming legislation?&rsquo;</p> 
<p>And if you&rsquo;re still left unsure whether your business is comfortably 
on the road to Zero Waste compliance,get in touch with the team at Changeworks 
Recycling today and find out how we can help.</p>

<h1>Nappy&nbsp;Chat</h1> Posted on January 20, 2012 <br>
Reply <br>

<p></p> 
<p>I was first introduced to flat nappies when my sister used them on my 
niece, who is now twenty-six years old. So it was a long time ago, I was a 
teenager, and babies were the last thing on my mind.</p> 
<p>I certainly changed a few of those nappies and didn&rsquo;t think it was so 
difficult. In fact trying out the different folds was fun. But twenty years 
later I didn&rsquo;t ever think cloth nappies were an option until I went to 
visit a friend in Cumbria who again was using flat nappies. This time though, 
with a wonderful wee invention called the &lsquo;nappy nippa&rsquo;. There were 
no more safety pins and it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to close your eyes and hope 
for the best anymore!</p> 
<p>So when I was expecting my baby I knew real nappies were an option, and one 
I wanted to pursue because of cost and definitely because of the environment. A 
friend recommended a particular make and we used them the majority of the time 
until my son was toilet trained. My partner and I enjoyed using the nappies, 
two part, birth to potty and found them pretty straight forward.</p> 
<p>My friend told me about the&nbsp;Real Nappy project Coordinators Role, I 
applied, and the rest is history. I have been involved with the project for two 
years and it is still brilliant. Every parent who comes to the project is at 
the start of their &lsquo;nappy journey&rsquo; and it is so lovely to be part 
of that.</p> 
<p>Approximately 9,500 babies are born throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians 
every year which means there are lots of new parents who every day are keen to
find out about real nappies, a real alternative to disposable nappies.</p> 
<p>Parents most frequently come to the Real Nappy project at the beginning of 
their &lsquo;nappy journey&rsquo;, often overwhelmed by the information online. 
Through our experience of talking to parents we have found they are often 
looking for:impartial information that is free from confusing jargon; the 
opportunity to try the nappies, to see and feel them without spending large 
sums of money and talk to areal person who has used real nappies. We encourage 
people to be tactile with the nappies themselves and fact-ile with the real 
nappy users who will answer as many questions as you can ask.</p> 
<p>All of these things the Real Nappy project can offer. We do talks, we hold 
events and we can give parents the opportunity to try some of the nappies 
currently available without spending lots of money. We have two project 
incentives<strong>trial packs</strong> and <strong>lending kits</strong>. The 
aim of the trial pack is to provide parents with a sample of good quality, 
reliable nappies, a wrap and accessories to help parents make an informed 
decision when choosing reusable nappies. There are four types of nappies in the 
pack, each pack also includes a wrap. Lending kits are available to borrow for 
three weeks. There are eight kinds of nappies in the kits: We supply nappy 
buckets, laundry meshes, reusable wipes, paper and fleece liners, and 
waterproof wraps&nbsp;- everything you need!</p> 
<p>We also can give advice over the phone and by email. The project has twenty 
fantastic volunteers who are all parents who have used real nappies so between 
us we are able to answer all queries.</p> 
<p>So what are the benefits of using real nappies?</p> 
<p><strong>Cost savings: </strong>Real nappies could save you &pound;500 
compared to disposable nappies even when the<strong> </strong>cost of washing 
them is taken into account.<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Easy to use: </strong>Gone are the days of pins and complicated 
folding!</p> 
<p><strong> Funky: </strong>Real nappies come in a variety of styles, colours 
and<strong> </strong>patterns, to suit you, your baby and your budget.Many real 
nappies are shaped to fit, fasten with Velcro or poppers and are covered with a 
breathable waterproof wrap.</p> 
<p><strong>Reliable: </strong>Real nappies are absorbent.<strong> </strong>
Shaped nappies are elasticated around the waist<strong> </strong>and legs and 
offer excellent containment particularly<strong> </strong>for new born babies. 
Waterproof wraps offer a second layer to protect against leaks.</p> 
<p><strong>Real waste reduction: </strong>By choosing real nappies you could 
reduce your household waste by half and reduce the 8 million disposable nappies 
that go to landfill everyday in the UK.</p> 
<p>Next week is an exciting time for the Changeworks Real Nappy project. We 
have extended what we do in order to offer a more comprehensive service to 
parents living in Edinburgh and the Lothians and also generate some income for 
the project. The Duncan Place Nappuccino on Thursday 26</p> 
<p>January at Duncan Place Resource Centre, Duncan Place (just off Duke 
Street) from 10-11.30am is &lsquo;new &amp; improved&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>In partnership with Little Froggie (an independent nappy retailer run by 
Ingrid Leloup), the Real Nappy project will now be able to offer parents the 
opportunity to place orders and buy new nappies from the following 
manufactures: Lollipop; Little Lambs; Tots Bots; Blueberry; Nature Babies; 
Bright Bots; Wonderoos and GenY.</p> 
<p>Great value second hand nappies will also be available to buy, in addition 
to nappy accessories such as liners, nappy nippas&nbsp;and meshes. Parents will 
also be able to drop off donated nappies at the event or thereafter at the 
Changeworks offices, in the knowledge that their resale will be of benefit to 
the project.</p> 
<p>The new, improved Nappuccino will continue to offer parents <strong>free
</strong> advice and information from parents who have experience of using real 
nappies. Different types of nappies are available to see and parents can apply 
for, and collect, trial packs and lending kits.</p> 
<p><em>So if you have a baby or are about to have a baby and are interested in 
finding out about real nappies why not get in touch ortake a look online? Or 
why not recommend it to a friend that&rsquo;s pregnant?</em></p>

<h1>This Wheel&rsquo;s On&nbsp;Fire</h1> Posted on January 12, 2012 <br>

<p><strong>On Yer Bike Makes Moves to Keep&nbsp;Sustainable Transport Spinning
</strong></p> 
<p>There was reportedly over 350 people taking part in Wednesday&rsquo;s rally 
outside St. Andrews&rsquo; House, and sporting a funky Changeworks cycling 
jacket, I was getting in on the action along with a whole host of other 
environmental groups, cyclists and a plethora of people concerned with cuts to 
sustainable transport.</p> 
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s future could look a little something like this.</p> 
<p>During the event Transport and Housing Minister, Keith Brown, received a 
letter from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland&nbsp;backing the &ldquo;social, 
environmental and economic benefits&rdquo; that emissions reduction targets 
would bring. He gave a speech. Some people grumbled, but the overwhelming mood 
was one of optimism.</p> 
<p>Earlier that day, a few of us had set off from the office, gathering more 
members as we ascended to the top of one of&nbsp;Edinburgh&rsquo;s many hills, 
where the feeling of excitement was palpable. Cyclists ruling the roads! After 
it was over, in an entourage of some fifty bikes, I cycled my way past 
kowtowing buses and courteous car drivers while deep in conversation with a 
green consultant whom I had just met at a set of traffic lights.</p> 
<p>As we&nbsp;wheeled along a pedestrianised Princes Street, it was hard not 
imagine we were living in some futuristic version of Scotland, where people 
greeted one another when the traffic paused, with smiles rather than scowls. If 
only for a brief moment, it was easy to entertain the fantasy that Edinburgh 
could someday follow cities like Amsterdam, where in the transport triangle it 
is the car that comes bottom of the heap.</p> 
<p>SPOKES, a local cycling campaign group, were in attendance along with 
Transition Town Linlithgow. Representatives from major environmental 
organisations such asFriends of The Earth, the World Wildlife Fund and even 
local businesses such as Tollcross&rsquo; Soul Cycles came along, having closed 
the shop for lunch. You can see what they had to say over atSTV Local.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ois&iacute;n&nbsp;Murphy-Lawless and baby Orla (pictured right) were among 
a diverse group of all ages (and cycling skills) who joined the crowd that had 
gathered to help keep the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Climate 
Change&nbsp;targets on track.</p> 
<p>The Stop Climate Chaos organisers explained that despite the success of the 
rally, the campaign is ongoing:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to your help, our recent e-actions have helped influence key 
MSPs in the Scottish Parliament to call for proper funding for action on 
climate change, but we still&nbsp;have to convince Ministers to amend their 
budget plans accordingly. The Budget Bill will be laid before Parliament next 
week and will be finalised and voted on before mid-February. So there is still 
an opportunity to influence what is and what isn&rsquo;t funded.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This really could have been a glimpse of the future,&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s a 
future I&rsquo;d be happy to live in.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You can follow what people were saying throughout the event on&nbsp;Twitter
, and if you want to keep up with green issues be sure to find&nbsp;Changeworks

<h1>Shop local, buy&nbsp;local</h1> Posted on January 4, 2012 <br>
Reply <br>

<p>Sourcing things, stuff and all sorts locally is becoming more of a hot 
topic these days.&nbsp; There are different motivations for it too, from 
cutting the carbon associated from transporting goods to supporting your local 
economy. Then there are the various counter-arguments that can really make your 
mind boggle, especially if you really care about what and where you buy.</p> 
<p>Take&nbsp;food, for example, there&rsquo;s lots to think about and there 
isn&rsquo;t one definitive answer when it comes to life&rsquo;s most 
fundamental purchases:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A humble tomato &ndash; which is better, one grown locally in a heated 
greenhouse or one grown outdoors in a faraway land that had to make a very long 
trip to get here?</li> 
<li>Local meat or exotic vegetables? Locally sourced organic meat sounds like 
a good idea but what if you stopped worrying about the local aspect and became 
vegetarian, wouldn&rsquo;t that have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint?
</li> 
<li>Is the optimum answer to go veggie and eat locally and seasonally, maybe 
even grow your own? If you fancy giving that a try, it would be worth 
researching some local food projects like the&nbsp;Fife Diet&nbsp;for some 
inspiration as hearing &lsquo;pass the turnip&rsquo; one time too often might 
weaken your resolve.</li> </ul> 
<p>What about when it comes to the more luxurious purchases? Will buying 
locally be better or worse, cheaper or more expensive? It could well be any of 
these but the way to find out is probably just to give it a try.</p> 
<p>Then, of course, there are&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;to consider. I recently had a 
dress made by a local tailor/dressmaker. It was genuinely my best dress-buying 
experience ever. To give a little context, I truly hate clothes shopping 
especially for dresses &ndash; I don&rsquo;t conform to conventional 
dress-sizing (who does these days? Only a lucky few!) and I find it a 
thoroughly depressing and usually fruitless task.</p> 
<p>It cost me &pound;70 to have a dress designed and made to fit and flatter 
my shape. I feel good when I wear it and an added bonus is that I&rsquo;ll 
never bump into someone wearing the same thing. For me, this local purchase was 
definitely a cost-effective and positive experience that I plan to repeat. It 
also makes me want to look at what else would be better if I bought it locally.
</p> 
<p>Are you following a local diet or do you have great tips for where to get 
high quality local goods? Tell us about your experiences.</p>

<h1>The Gift That Keeps on Giving: Tips for a Sustainable&nbsp;Season</h1> 
Posted on December 23, 2011 <br>
Reply <br>

<p>The festive season is a time for celebration for many people and, almost 
inevitably, a spot of overindulgence. As a result, we tend to use a lot more 
energy &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t mean during those last-minute trips to the 
shops &ndash; and produce a lot more waste than usual. Here are a few tips, 
helping you to have a great time over the festive period while doing your bit 
for the environment.</p> 
<p>Think of it as our gift to you.</p> 
<p><strong>1. The presents</strong></p> 
<p>There are loads of solar-powered toys and cool wind-up gadgets around, so 
why not think about these as presents for kids &ndash; of all ages! Using 
re-chargeable batteries will help to reduce the number of single use batteries 
going to landfill and could save you money in the long-term. Check out 
sustainable gift options online. Charity shops can be superb places to find an 
unusual or individual gift for that special someone &hellip; For those of you 
living or visiting Edinburgh, there&rsquo;s the handyEdinburgh charity shop and 
reuse map.</p> 
<p>Hand-made gifts are personal and show you&rsquo;ve invested your energy in 
the giftee &ndash; checkremadeinedinburgh and other sites for inspiration and 
techniques. Maybe set yourself a resolution to make all your gifts hand-made 
next year, by making use of the free drop-in sessions and the training &ndash; 
appliqu&eacute; patchwork anyone? (Yes, please!).</p> 
<p>If your fingers are all thumbs, then cooking up a chutney or infusing a 
booze, might be more your avenue of choice.</p> 
<p><strong>2. The wrapping</strong></p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the presents, so why not wrap them using reusable paper 
gift bags or recycled wrapping paper, newspapers or magazines you&rsquo;ve 
finished reading rather than the shiny, metallic variety? Tie up presents with 
funky ribbon, minimalist string or natural raffia &ndash; no sticky tape means 
you can save the paper and use it again.</p> 
<p><strong>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;The tree and decorations<br>
</strong>Choose a 
living tree that can be planted out after the festive season and used again. If 
your tree doesn&rsquo;t have roots, you will be able to recycle it, in most 
areas, using your kerbside recycling service or you can take it to a Community 
Recycling Centre. You could also invest in some Light Emitting Diode (LED) 
lights to decorate your tree and your home. They look great, appeal to the 
(possible) tech geek in all of us and use less energy than traditional 
Christmas lights. Of course they last longer too, so you&rsquo;ve really no 
excuse.</p> 
<p>To recycle your trees, check with your local community recycling centre 
about their garden waste/green waste containers. Trees will be shredded then 
composted. Also handy to check local press and council websites for details.</p>
<p>For people in Edinburgh, the Lothians and the Scottish Borders Check out 
our onlineToo Good to Waste &ndash;the A-Z guide of practical ways to reduce, 
reuse, repair and recycle. Alsocheck your local council&rsquo;s website</p> 
<p>For more on real, fake or home-made &lsquo;trees&rsquo;, check out our 
Ruth&rsquo;s recent blog.</p> 
<p>Back to the sparkly stuff. You can make decorations from re-used paper. For 
a hand-made traditional feel and a great way to spend a wet afternoon, there 
are a whole stack oftutorials online.<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;The cards and gift tags<br>
</strong>If you have 
access to a computer, why not send an electronic card to friends and family? 
Recycle any cards you receive with your other cardboard via your kerbside 
recycling scheme, local recycling facility or Community Recycling Centre. Still 
got your cards from last year? Cutting out pictures from old Christmas cards is 
a neat way to make home-made gift tags. Got a lot of cars through the post, why 
not help outone of these charities by donating your old stamps.</p> 
<p><strong>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong>The grub<br>
</strong>Support your 
local economy by shopping for your festive food at your nearest farmers&rsquo; 
market. Local products tend to have less packaging and are not transported long 
distances. Try to choose unwrapped fruit and vegetables, to cut down on 
unnecessary packaging.</p> 
<p>Over &pound;1 billion worth of food is wasted by consumers in Scotlandeach 
year. That&rsquo;s an average of &pound;430 per household, &pound;550 for the 
average Scottish family with kids.Kitchen Canny is here to help you gain those 
savings,<strong>eat better, live smarter, love the heart of your home. </strong>
You can get hold of oneonline.</p> 
<p><strong>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;The lunch<br>
</strong>Cook with lids on pans and 
match ring size to saucepan size to save energy. Call 0800 512 012 for energy 
efficiency advice. Compost your vegetable peelings, and by next Christmas, 
you&rsquo;ll have FREE nutritious compost &ndash; black gold! &ndash; to help 
make your garden grow.Visit our website&nbsp;or call 0131 555 4010 for more 
composting info.</p> 
<p><strong>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;The party<br>
</strong>Avoid disposable plates, 
cutlery and napkins and use real ones instead, which reduce waste and look 
smart. Hire extra glasses, rather than buying new ones. Put leftovers in 
reusable containers, rather than wrapping them in foil or plastic film, and 
recycle your empty bottles and jars. Wait until you have a full load before 
using your dish washer: full load, eco cycle and whoever didn&rsquo;t cook 
cleans up.</p> 
<p><strong>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;The unwanted gift<br>
</strong>Take any unwanted 
presents to your local charity shop, organise a swap party, sell online or 
offer up to anyone who&rsquo;s interested on sites such as Freecycle. If 
you&rsquo;re in or near Edinburgh, you&rsquo;re lucky. Take a look at
Changeworks Edinburgh Charity Shop and Reuse Map or look up your local charity 
shops.</p> 
<p><strong>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;The sales<br>
</strong>Remember to take reusable 
bags or reuse old plastic bags, when you venture out to the shops. Many 
supermarkets now have plastic bag recycling facilities, so you can recycle bags 
when they are no longer fit for use.</p> 
<p><strong>10. The travel<br>
</strong>Try to use public transport, where 
possible, during the festive season. Better for the environment and, if you 
decide to have a wee glass of festive fizz, it&rsquo;s no problem getting back 
home. Cheers to that!</p> 
<p><strong>10. The New Year (it&rsquo;s a new dawn, it&rsquo;s a new day)<br>

</strong>If they&rsquo;re your kind of thing, why not make a New Year&rsquo;s 
resolution to lead a more sustainable life? Or just do it anyway. Whatever you 
fancy&hellip; start home composting, cut down on your food waste and booking at 
least one holiday in your home country rather than flying abroad are all great 
sustainable ideas.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s your tip?</p> 
<p>Wishing you and yours a merry festive season.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;- Jo</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fed up hearing about how dreadful it is to have a real Christmas 
tree. That I should buy a fake one because it will last a long time and produce 
less waste, I should buy one in a pot and keep it alive, or that I should 
abandon all vestiges of consumerism and spend Christmas in a cave wrapped in 
discarded newspaper.</p> 
<p>Well, okay, no one&rsquo;s suggested that last one yet but it&rsquo;s only 
a matter of time.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re facing the same dilemma, here are a few factors to consider.
</p> 
<p><strong>Fake ones &ndash; nice to look at but it just doesn&rsquo;t feel 
the same</strong><strong>(like many other fake, er&hellip; things)</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Fake trees</strong> are manufactured using materials like PVC 
(polyvinyl chloride &ndash; very un-green petroleum-derived plastic) and often 
travel thousands of miles from the factory to their destination markets.</p> 
<p>They don&rsquo;t just come with a high carbon footprint, they can cause 
health problems too. The manufacturing process (often in countries with little 
or no staff safety legislation) produces carcinogens &ndash; cancer-causing 
particles. Closer to home, it&rsquo;s alsobeen said that some plastic trees 
give off a lead-based dust that, if inhaled, can lead to liver or kidney 
diseases or even fertility problems.</p> 
<p>Are we all agreed that this cancels out any merit implied by their long 
life &ndash; so long, in fact, that they&rsquo;ll outlive your 
great-great-grandchildren on a landfill tip somewhere?</p> 
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like the real thing</strong></p> 
<p>Buying a <strong>real tree in a pot</strong> and tending to it year after 
year sounds like a lovely green-fingered, green-minded approach. It&rsquo;s the 
perfect solution if you are willing and able to manage it.</p> 
<p>Firstly you need to have room for it, i.e. a garden or at least a balcony 
(I have neither). Secondly, how big is it going to get? If you want it to grow 
into a nice big healthy looking tree you could be waiting a while &ndash; and 
you&rsquo;ll have to re-pot it like any other plant, or even plant it in the 
ground. Lots of digging, and we all love doing outdoorsy things like that when 
its -11&deg;C.</p> 
<p>Or you could buy one at the size you want and hope that it lasts &ndash; 
not likely if you buy it pre-cultivated.Advice given is that trees are dormant 
in winter and shouldn&rsquo;t be indoors for more than a week. If they warm up 
too much they could &lsquo;wake up&rsquo; early and start to grow &ndash; this 
means they&rsquo;re unlikely to survive once they&rsquo;re back in the cold 
outdoors.</p> 
<p>One day when I have a garden I&rsquo;ll give it a go, but the poor thing 
will probably meet the same fate as most of the plants I&rsquo;ve ever owned 
&ndash; an untimely demise.</p> 
<p>Why buy a <strong>pre-cut real tree</strong>? There&rsquo;s something so 
nostalgic and cheering about the smell of the sap, the ordeal of getting it 
home (this year we borrowed a shopping trolley, which we returned of course!) 
and the experience of picking one out from the yard and watching it get wrapped 
up so you can manhandle it back home.</p> 
<p>It <em>is</em>&nbsp;a shame that these trees are &lsquo;killed&rsquo; just 
to stand looking glamorous in a corner for a matter of days. It&rsquo;s like 
buying someone a bunch of flowers or worse still, letting a bag of salad go off 
in the fridge. But like the flowers (not so much the limp radicchio) a real 
Christmas tree brings delight and enjoyment to families, especially children 
&ndash; and cats.</p> 
<p>They also cause problems for Councils that don&rsquo;t use discarded trees 
for things like compost or biomass fuel. Many trees are sprayed with pesticides 
too. Some producers do make sure the environmental impact is kept to a minimum, 
so if there&rsquo;s an ethical supplier near you (and you don&rsquo;t mind 
paying a few quid extra) that&rsquo;s an option that might shrink your 
tree-guilt.</p> 
<p><strong>Think global, act local</strong></p> 
<p>Coniferous trees are grown in (but not native to) Scotland. They are 
cultivated on a large-scale to meet the needs of the timber industry. 
Production is largely sustainable as the industry is maintained through 
replanting &ndash; wood is, after all, renewable.According to one source, an 
acre of Douglas fir trees can absorb 11,308.7 lbs of carbon dioxide each year.
</p> 
<p>My verdict? Buying a <strong>real tree </strong>&ndash; potted or not 
&ndash; supports Scottish producers and suppliers. Your money&rsquo;s going to 
local businesses rather than supermarkets and far-flung cancer factories. Some 
charities even sell trees to raise money for their causes too &ndash; 
it&rsquo;s worth doing a bit of research to inform your choice of holiday 
horticulture.</p> 
<p>Still not sure? There&rsquo;s no need to cancel Christmas &ndash; for me, 
spending money on a real tree is better for the economy and the environment. 
When it comes to the age-old debate &ndash;<strong>real vs fake</strong> 
&ndash; real&rsquo;s the winner for me every time. We do have a choice, and 
what we decide to do (not just at Christmas but every day) has an impact on the 
world around us &ndash; so it<em>is</em> worth considering what&rsquo;s right 
for you and what reflects your values</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s your view? Got any ideas for alternatives to having a 
Christmas tree? Leave a comment and let us know&hellip; and have a happy 
holiday season!</p>

<p><strong>PS </strong>Fancy something canny to put under your tree (fake, 
real, or home-made)? The newKitchen Canny kit can help your kitchen run like a 
well oiled machine!&nbsp;A pretty good&nbsp;way to start the New Year.</p>
