<h3> Fresh vs Fake? The Green Christmas Tree Debate </h3> <br>
You know its a 
trend when it gets its own lobbying group in Washington. And the numbers 
suggest that consumers have already made a decision at which traditionalists 
cringe: last year Americans bought 50 million artificial trees versus 30 
million real ones.<br>
<br>
 The battle of real vs fake is on - and both are 
using the environment as their primary argument. Fake tree supporters claim 
they are saving trees and that recycling theirs is better than throwing out 
fresh ones every year. Real tree advocates claim that encouraging farmers to 
grow trees is the healthier sustainable choice and that the combination of 
toxic chemicals and energy usage necessary for manufacturing the fake ones 
cancels out any possible benefits.<br>
<br>
 Both groups cite statistics to 
support their claims and neither has a clear hold on virtue. Reading the fine 
print, it does seem that the fake trees' environmental benefits depend on reuse 
for six to ten years - but no data are yet available on average fake tree 
longevity.<br>
<br>
 As usual, consumers appear to be deciding the issue on the 
basis of emotion, tradition, values - and cost. The advantage of fake trees - 
lower price, less hassle, reusability - has won so far. But the traditionalists 
are not giving up. Those racks of trees that magically appear at Thanksgiving 
on city streets and in suburban malls seem likely to be with us for a long 
time. JL<br>
<br>
 Darryl Fears and Robert Samuels report in the Washington 
Post:
<blockquote> This Christmas, Vicki Freshley will proudly show off her prized 
fake fir. In her eyes, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing, as nice as any real 
Christmas tree &mdash; nine feet tall, emerald and fluffy, and decked out with 
so many eye-popping trimmings that her brother stopped in his tracks when he 
saw it and said, &ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 But in the eyes of many 
environmentalists, Freshley could have made a better choice than buying that 
artificial tree last year at a Costco near her home in Gaithersburg. Even tree 
huggers are encouraging Americans to go out every December and buy a real tree 
from a lot or go to a farm, cut one down, and drag it home because tree farms 
are good for the atmosphere<br>
 Artificial trees have been gaining ground in 
American living rooms &mdash; 50 million fake trees vs. 30 million fresh ones. 
According to industry groups, the long-standing National Christmas Tree 
Association (which supports real trees) and the more recently formed American 
Christmas Tree Association (defends artificial trees).<br>
<br>
 But the real 
trees aren&rsquo;t going down without a fight. The battle comes to a head today 
&mdash; two weeks before Christmas &mdash; the Christmas trees&rsquo; own Black 
Friday, expected to be the highest-traffic day in tree buying. And at the 
forefront of the argument is which kind of tree is better for the environment.
<br> <br>
 For a symbol of yuletide cheer, the tree brings out some pretty 
hostile rhetoric. One side&rsquo;s Web site says fake Christmas trees were 
invented as oversize &ldquo;green toilet brushes.&rdquo; The other&rsquo;s 
claims that &ldquo;after two weeks of being indoors, a live Christmas tree 
emitted significant amounts of mold spores.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Each side offers 
what it considers compelling evidence.<br>
<br>
 Real fir &mdash; along with 
pine and spruce &mdash; has benefits beyond a fresh smell that says Christmas, 
supporters say. The trees&rsquo; purchase encourages farmers to keep planting 
acres that absorb carbon dioxide from the air, soak up storm-water runoff full 
of nutrient and sediment pollution before it pours into waterways such as the 
Chesapeake Bay, and provide habitat for wildlife.<br>
<br>
 The real trees also 
have a smaller carbon footprint than ones made with plastic and shipped mostly 
from factories in China, said Stephanie Flack, Potomac River Project director 
for the Nature Conservancy. &ldquo;This time of year, while people are thinking 
of gifts they get from under the tree, they should be thinking about the gift 
from trees,&rdquo; Flack said.<br>
<br>
 But the American Christmas Tree 
Association would say that Freshley&rsquo;s fake-tree purchase was the greener 
choice. The group cites a study to support its view that fake trees have a 
lower carbon footprint &mdash; if consumers hold on to fake trees for six to 10 
years &mdash; considering the energy it takes to chop, water and transport 
fresh trees annually.<br>
<br>
 The study did not say how long the typical tree 
buyer holds on to faux firs. But at any rate, the group says, most fake trees 
go back into a box, rather than a street curb for pickup by a truck.<br>
<br>
 
Real trees have other drawbacks: Some, such as the Fraser fir, are susceptible 
to a deadly water mold that can infect other trees, according to the Sierra 
Club, and nearly all firs are doused with pesticides to kill invasive pests 
such as the Douglas fir beetle.<br>
