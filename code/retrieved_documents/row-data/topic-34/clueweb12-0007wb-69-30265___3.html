<h3>Buying a Real Christmas Tree, Not Bad for the Environment, WSU Researcher 
Says</h3> <b></b> <br>
<br>

<p>PULLMAN, Wash. - It's that time of year again, the stores are flooded with 
holiday decorations, the street corners are lined with Christmas trees for sale 
and many people are torn with the decision to decorate a real or fake tree this 
year. For those do-it-yourself individuals, &quot;Cut your own Christmas Tree 
Month&quot; is upon us and many families participate in the age-old tradition 
of chopping down their own tree.</p> 
<p>One-third of the 34-36 million Christmas trees harvested each year are 
grown in Western Washington and Oregon. Gary Chastagner, professor of plant 
pathology at Washington State University's Puyallup Research and Extension 
Center, attributes this to the good growing sites, moderate temperatures, good 
rain fall and a good grower-knowledge base that produces good quality trees in 
the Northwest.</p> 
<p>According to the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, 92 percent 
of all Northwest harvested Christmas trees are exported out of the region and 
around the world, with 47 percent going to California. Nationally, one million 
acres of land is used for Christmas tree harvest. Of that, Oregon uses 63,000 
acres and Washington uses 25,000 acres.</p> 
<p>Many people who purchase fake Christmas trees do so because they believe 
that cutting down real trees is bad for the environment. However, &quot;most 
Christmas trees are grown as crop and replanted, so it is really no different 
than harvesting corn,&quot; Chastagner explained. &quot;There is natural 
reseeding of trees in forests and permits are given out to cut down Christmas 
trees in areas that need to be thinned.&quot;</p> 
<p>The National Christmas Tree Association also stresses how the use of real 
Christmas trees is actually better for the environment than fake trees. 
According to research, most fake trees are only used 6 to 9 years before 
they're disposed. Even if you would use one for 20 years or more, it will 
eventually be thrown away and end up in a landfill, unlike real trees, which 
are biodegradable and recyclable.</p> 
<p>In order to keep your cut Christmas trees fresh and have the longest needle 
retention possible, Chastagner said the &quot;single most important thing to do 
is to re-cut the base of the tree and display in a water tree stand that holds 
one gallon of water per one inch of stem diameter.&quot;</p> 
<p>If properly taken care of, a Douglas Fir can live and retain its needles 
three weeks and Noble Fir can last for four to six weeks. Chastagner has 
conducted extensive research and found that additives that are on sale on the 
market don't work, your best bet for long tree life is &quot;plain old 
water.&quot;</p> 
<p>Chastagner's Christmas tree research focuses on disease problems that 
affect the production of high quality Christmas trees and how to manage them, 
as well as post harvest quality. He can be reached at 253-445-4528 or

</h5> 
<p> PULLMAN, Wash. &#151; Calcium builds strong bones, good teeth&#151;and

Experiments show that calcium, when bound to a protein called calmodulin, 
prompts plants to make salicylic acid (SA) when threatened by infection or 
other danger. SA is a close chemical relative of aspirin. In plants, SA acts as 
a signal molecule that kicks off a series of reactions that help defend against 
external threats.</p> </li> </ul> Research News and Features, PO Box 641040,
