<p>Which is &quot;greener,&quot; an artificial Christmas tree or a real one? 
</p> 
<p>Fir flew (so to speak) last year when British organic gardening guru Bob 
Flowerdew, author of &quot;Bob Flowerdew's Organic Bible: Successful Gardening 
the Natural Way,&quot; <em></em>announced he was buying a fake Christmas tree 
to save the forests. His defection from the ranks of live-tree advocates was 
testament to conflicting gospels on what exactly constitutes an environmentally 
friendly tree.</p> 
<p>The Flowerdew faction is small but earnest. The logic: Manufacturing and 
shipping a plastic tree emits a small amount of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere, but just once. A tree left in the ground removes many times that 
amount, year after year.</p> 
<p>Doesn't plastic's everlasting nature, they ask, make it the least-awful 
alternative? Because it lasts and lasts, a plastic tree could, in theory, spare 
more live trees every year it is used. Maybe that would reserve agricultural 
land for food -- or spare the environment from pesticides, herbicides and 
erosion.</p> 
<h2>No forests fall </h2>The major reason the Flowerdew faction is small, 
however, is that the plastic-is-green rationale has more holes than a watering 
can. If forests are falling, it's not because of Christmas trees, points out 
Gary Chastagner, a Washington State University professor of plant pathology who 
specializes in Christmas-tree diseases and post-harvest quality.
<p></p> 
<p> &quot;The notion that people are going out in large numbers and harvesting 
trees out of forests is not correct,&quot; Chastagner says. &quot;These plants 
we are talking about -- Christmas trees, wreaths, boughs, cut flowers -- they 
are grown as crops,&quot; Chastagner says, not swiped from Mother Nature.</p>

<p>In fact, the market for Christmas trees means millions are planted each 
year, each &quot;sequestering&quot; by expert estimates, anywhere from 40 to 
300 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.</p> 
<p>So, by buying a real tree, you're saving the Earth, just a little, as well 
as sustaining what many would call the green heart and soul of Christmas. 
&quot;They were originally put up to show life in the dead of winter,&quot; 
says Patrick Downey, a Christmas-tree grower in Sherbrooke, Quebec. 
&quot;Putting up a plastic tree has no meaning whatsoever.&quot;</p>

<p>The industry is &quot;predominately family farms that are supporting rural 
communities,&quot; at least in his state, says Jeff Owen, a Christmas-tree 
extension specialist at North Carolina State University. Christmas-tree farms, 
he says, are restoring wildlife -- rodents, songbirds, foxes, wild turkeys, 
birds of prey, bobcats, deer and -- it is rumored -- mountain lions. &quot;Some 
of these counties, the quail had disappeared a generation ago. We've started to 
see quail coming back where they had disappeared because of habitat loss.&quot;
</p> 
<h2>Credentials </h2>Adding to their green credentials, live trees are often 
recycled. In North Carolina, discarded Christmas trees are tied to sand dunes 
to trap sand and slow erosion. They're bundled and sunk into lakes to make a 
habitat where fingerlings can hide from big predators. Cities and towns around 
the country recycle trees after Christmas by grinding them into garden mulch 
that they sell -- or give -- back to the folks who discarded the trees in the 
first place.
<p></p> 
<p>At the same time, live trees clean up air pollution. They suck carbon 
dioxide -- a huge contributor to global warming and respiratory disease -- out 
of the air and turn it into wood. The bigger the tree, the more carbon dioxide 
the tree scrubs from the atmosphere and the more oxygen it returns.</p>

<b> How to choose a Christmas tree</b> <br>

Lisa Benenson of Hallmark magazine gives some tips on choosing the perfect tree 
and making it look great over the holiday season. 
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;For every tree we harvest, we replant,&quot; says Joe Sharp, owner of 
Yule Tree Farm in Oregon, the biggest Christmas-tree-producing state. Last 
summer Sharp and another big Oregon grower started theCoalition of 
Environmentally-Conscious Growers, to certify sustainably grown trees. But it's 
still hard to find their labels.</p> 
<h2>The problem with plastic </h2>If you're thinking you're keeping a tree 
alive by hanging on to an artificial tree for nine or 10 years, don't pat 
yourself on the back just yet. Once you're sick of the plastic tree, Chastagner 
says, it'll live on in a landfill for centuries. Not eternal, perhaps, but from 
the American perspective, darned close.
<p></p> 
<p>Plastic trees also can cause more-immediate health problems. After just a 
week indoors, many artificial trees shed a dry dust containing lead, a powerful 
neurotoxin, the University of North Carolina's late environmental studies 
director, Richard Maas, found in his research</p> 
<p>&quot;It would still in many usage scenarios expose a young child to enough 
lead to knock a couple of IQ points off that child's intellectual ability,&quot;
Maas told WSBTV in Atlanta in 2005.</p>
