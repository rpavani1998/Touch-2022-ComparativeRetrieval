Christmas Tree Debate <br>

<br>
The Great Christmas Tree Debate<br>
</strong><br>

Our family still uses cut Christmas tree&nbsp;but I certainly wish pesticides 
weren't used so heavily in their production. The irony is that trees are so 
easy to grow with organic techniques. Anyway, here's some of what's written 
about the issue so you can make up your own mind.<br>
<br>
<strong>For those of 
us who want to be environmentally conscious but can't let go of the idea of 
enjoying a Christmas tree, the decision must be made whether to invest in a 
faux tree or enjoy a real tree.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It can be a monumental task just 
sorting through the information in the ongoing debate of which option is better 
for the earth. A helpful place to start is theOrganic Consumers Association's 
compilation of articles assembled over the past year regarding Christmas trees 
and their impact on the environment.<br>

Holiday Greenery, Lights and Ornaments<br>

</em><br>
Decking the halls is a feat of interior design 
that takes a good eye and a green thumb. Yet, the holiday spirit can be 
dampened by the knowledge that monocrop tree farms use pesticides such as 
glyphosate (Roundup), associated with chest pains and nausea in humans and 
deadly to many fish and beneficial insects. Other pesticides used include the 
organophosphates di-syston 15-G, which can cause convulsions and 
unconsciousness, and dimethoate, which can cause tremors and breathing 
difficulties. But it's not that you'll need to wear a face mask around your 
tree. &quot;Many pesticides will have been removed from trees by rain and 
ultraviolet light by the time they are harvested,&quot; says Dr. Thomas Arcury, 
Ph.D., professor of family and community medicine at Wake Forest University 
School of Medicine. &quot;However, some will remain and, in particular, one, 
the systemic pesticide di-syston 15-G, may be present in the tree.&quot; 
Luckily, there are better choices to keep this holiday season healthy, organic 
and even fair-trade friendly.<br>

<em>Happier holidays: simple ways to celebrate the season in 
sustainable style<br>
Natural Health,&nbsp; Dec, 2005&nbsp; by Janelle Brown<br>
</em><br>
EVERY YEAR, roughly 35 million Christmas trees are cut down and sold, 
serving as a major source of holiday waste. Does that mean you should hang your 
ornaments on the coat rack?<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't feel guilty about buying a 
tree,&quot; says Deborah Gangloff, executive director of American Forests, a 
nonprofit conservation organization. Holiday trees are grown as a sustainable 
crop; in fact, 1 acre of Christmas trees produces enough oxygen to support 18 
people, and provides habitats for birds and wildlife. Buying an artificial tree 
isn't a better choice, since most faux foliage is made from earth-toxic PVC.<br>
<br>&quot;The very best thing you can do is buy a live tree--not a cut tree, 
but a live tree, with a root ball,&quot; Gangloff advises. Live trees can be 
found at most nurseries and some tree lots. When you're done with it, plant the 
tree in your garden. This requires some forethought, particularly in colder 
climates where you'll need to break up the ground for planting before it 
freezes; you'll also need to keep a live tree moist, and indoors for no longer 
than a week. If that's not possible, purchase your cut tree from a tree farm 
that shuns pesticides and chemicals.<br>
<br>
Unhappily, the vast majority of 
holiday trees end up in landfills, wrapped in plastic and trailing tinsel. 
Never dump your tree at the curb for the garbage collectors. Instead, take your 
de-decorated tree to a collection center, where it will be recycled--for 
example, ground up as mulch for use in city parks. To find one of the more than 
3,800 centers that accept old trees (some curbside pickup), visit earth911.org 
or call your city's public works department.<br>

<em>Chemical Christmas: immigrant tree farm workers face pesticide dangers<br>

E: The Environmental Magazine,&nbsp; Nov-Dec, 2005&nbsp; by Jesse James DeConto
<br></em><br>
<br>
Every Christmas, little Katie Alvarez asks her daddy for two 
trees, one for her formal living room, and one for the family room. Katie has 
no idea what those trees might cost her father. Treating Christmas tree fields 
each spring, farm-worker Felix Alvarez, 43, soaks his skin with Roundup, a 
weedkiller linked to cancer among applicators. &quot;Later on, when I get 
older, I'll probably have some consequence about it because I've been getting 
wet all over,&quot; Alvarez says.<br>
<br>
Second only to Oregon, the state of 
North Carolina produces roughly one out of five Christmas trees sold in the 
U.S.--about five million a year, worth more than $100 million. Each spring and 
summer, Hispanic workers like Alvarez handle some of the deadliest pesticides 
allowed by law, potentially risking their health to help Americans celebrate 
life.<br>
<br>
Fifty million Fraser firs grow on 25,000 acres in the mountains 
of North Carolina, and almost every acre is treated with Roundup. A salt 
compound, Roundup can irritate the eyes and is toxic when inhaled. In 1999, the 
American Cancer Society published the results of a survey of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma patients showing the disease was 2.7 times more likely among those who 
had applied glyphosate, the herbicide sold under the &quot;Roundup&quot; trade 
name.<br>

<br>
The most hazardous and second-most common 
pesticide in North Carolina Christmas tree farming is Di-Syston 15-G, a powder 
traditionally applied with a bucket and measuring spoon. &quot;If one grain 
gets in your boot, and your foot sweats, by the end of the day, you could be 
dead&quot; says Richard Boylan, an alternative agriculture agent with the North 
Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.<br>
<br>
Last year, Bayer 
CropSciences voluntarily discontinued Di-Syston 15-G for all crops other than 
Fraser firs in North Carolina and coffee in Puerto Rico. U.S. farms had 
previously used it for food crops such as Brussels sprouts, cabbage, 
cauliflower, peanuts and peppers. The EPA had threatened to ban it completely, 
but North Carolina's Christmas tree growers worked to develop a new 
closed-system applicator that enables workers to pour the granules from a 
stainless-steel spout rather than scooping them from an open bucket. &quot;We 
believe that the granular risks can be adequately mitigated by closed 
systems,&quot; says EPA spokesperson Enesta Jones.<br>
<br>
Christmas tree 
farmers use Di-Syston to control balsam twig aphids in the spring, and its 
residues prevent spruce spider mites throughout the year. The aphids cuff 
needles and stunt growth in firs, sometimes enough to make them worthless; the 
spider mites discolor evergreen needles by sucking their sap.<br>
<br>
&quot;If 
they lost [Di-Syston] and didn't come up with something that would take its 
place, you can put the Christmas tree business out of business,&quot; one 
grower told Wake Forest University researcher Pamela Rao in a paper published 
in Human Organization.<br>
<br>
Ever since a public outcry over childhood 
leukemia in the early 1990s, growers have been cutting pesticide use through a 
technique called Integrated Pest Management, which targets chemicals only where 
they're really needed. Between 1994 and 2000, growers reduced Di-Syston use 
from 65 percent of total acreage to 50 percent, according to North Carolina 
State Christmas tree specialist Jill Sidebottom.<br>
<br>
&quot;The industry 
has grown a lot,&quot; says Debbie Fishel, whose Grouse Ridge Farms employ 30 
to 60 Hispanic workers each year. &quot;I live in the same area they do and 
drink the same water. I am exposed to the same environment they are, and we 
have become aware of the risks.&quot;<br>
<br>
As they have reduced reliance on 
Di-Syston, growers have increased the spread of other insecticides, including 
Dimethoate, Lindane and Asana, all slightly or moderately toxic chemicals. 
Though Lindane is the least immediately harmful of these, the EPA banned it in 
2002 for its chronic effects and persistence in the environment.<br>
<br>
Like 
Di-Syston, Dimethoate is an organophosphate that can cause numbness, tingling 
sensations, headaches, dizziness, tremors, nausea, abdominal cramps, sweating, 
blurred vision, difficulty breathing and slow heartbeat, experts say.<br>
<br>

Asana is another spray that controls the balsam woolly adelgid, a European 
insect that has devastated Fraser firs in forest stands, flattening their tops, 
swelling their joints and hardening their wood. A worker poisoned with Asana 
could experience dizziness, burning, itching, blurred vision, tightness in the 
chest, convulsions, nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness or tremors, according 
to EXTOXNET, a network of university cooperative extension offices from across 
the United States. As with Dimethoate, swallowing less than two tablespoons of 
Asana can kill a grown man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Asana can make your skin burn for 
about six hours&quot; said one Christmas tree worker in 2001. &quot;Sometimes I 
can't sleep at night because my face burns so much. I use a mask and glasses, 
but there are still parts of my face that aren't covered, and the spray gets on 
your face anyway.&quot;<br>

<em>O Christmas 
tree, are ye real or fake?<br>
<br>
By JOE GAROFOLI<br>
San Francisco Chronicle
<br>16-DEC-05</em><br>
<br>
The cultural minefield of December has another 
politically loaded question to tiptoe around: Will you purchase a real tree or 
an artificial one?<br>
<br>
And then, what will you call it?<br>
<br>
Your 
answer will speak to your commitment to protecting American jobs, reducing the 
trade deficit, preventing environmental destruction, helping us breathe and, of 
course, showing where you stand on the Rev. Jerry Falwell's efforts to counter 
what he calls the anti-Christian &quot;war on Christmas.&quot;<br>
<br>
The 
choice between real and not real is especially painful for some 
environmentalists. Either they desecrate Earth and chop down a tree or buy a 
fake one that's full of landfill-clogging polyvinyl chloride, which is 
kryptonite to greenies.<br>
<br>
Salting a tree with pesticides and then 
chopping it down for a mere two weeks of display time isn't a great option. Ask 
San Francisco forest activist Kristi Chester Vance. When she invited friends to 
a party at her place this month, she warned her environmentalist pals on the 
guest list:<br>
<br>
There will be a tree here.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a forest 
activist, and there's a dead tree in the middle of my house,&quot; she said. 
&quot;Geez, if I have a tree, why not nail the last snow leopard to the wall, 
too?&quot;<br>
<br>
She acknowledges, though, that most Christmas trees are 
farmed like an agricultural product. &quot;It's kind of like corn,&quot; she 
said. &quot;It would be best to get an organic one, of course.&quot;<br>
<br>

As an alternative, Sierra Magazine, a Sierra Club publication, suggests: 
&quot;For a natural look, try making your own tree of trimmed evergreen boughs, 
a storm-felled branch, or a piece of driftwood.&quot;<br>
<br>
San Francisco's 
Department of the Environment began a program this year for those averse to 
stringing lights on driftwood. For $90, the city will bring a live, 7- to 
9-foot potted tree to your home for you to decorate. After Christmas, the city 
will retrieve it and plant it in one of San Francisco's tree-starved 
neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
But the city isn't offering pines. Officials said pines 
don't make the best street trees.<br>
<br>
Instead, they suggested hanging 
tinsel on a primrose, a Brisbane box tree or a fruitless olive tree. The 
program proved so popular that it sold out its stock of 100 trees in four days. 
It will return next year.<br>
<br>
Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly, a field 
marshal for the conservative counter-campaign against the &quot;war on 
Christmas,&quot; will be happy to know that San Francisco called this its 
&quot;Dreaming of a Green Christmas&quot; tree program. Not that there wasn't 
discussion about other names.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some people wanted to call it a 
'peace tree' or a 'holiday tree,' &quot; said Mark Westlund, a spokesman for 
the Department of the Environment. &quot;But we figured that only people who 
would be celebrating Christmas would want one for the most part.&quot;<br>
<br>

Deciding between real and fake trees wasn't always an ethical nightmare. The 
decision used to be more about one's tolerance for cleaning up pine needles.<br>
<br>But several years ago, America's tree growers started noticing that 
artificial trees were steadily gaining market share. In 1990, about half of 
U.S. tree-displaying homes were putting up artificial trees. In 2002, that 
number had grown to roughly 60 percent, say growers and fake-tree makers. 
Purchases of real trees declined from 32 million in 2002 to 23.4 million in 
2004, according the National Christmas Tree Association.<br>
<br>
So 
Christmas-tree growers got serious about telling their story. They hired a 
marketing firm that for decades had specialized in Republican political 
campaigns. The firm, Smith and Harroff, advocated reaching out to Generation Y 
(now there's an animated &quot;Attack of the Mutant Artificial Trees&quot; 
interactive game on the National Christmas Tree Association's Web site), 
Latinos (the association's materials are being translated into Spanish), 
first-time homebuyers and gays.<br>
<br>
Now, as possibly only a Douglas fir 
can do, Christmas trees have bridged a cultural divide. The firm that once 
consulted for the Republican National Committee was cooing about landing a 
pro-real-tree reference on TV's &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; show 
last year.<br>
<br>
Farmers talk about how buying a real tree protects U.S. 
jobs. China _ the leading exporter of fake trees _ shipped $69 million worth of 
artificial pines to the United States from January through August of this year, 
according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics. Overall, the artificial-tree trade 
deficit last year was $145 million, according to census statistics.<br>
<br>

More than 100,000 Americans are employed by the real-Christmas-tree industry, 
according to its trade association.<br>
<br>
Farmers say buying a Christmas 
tree is about protecting the environment. The National Christmas Tree 
Association takes it a step further, boasting that an acre of Christmas trees 
produces enough oxygen for 18 people. And it's trying to be a do-gooder, too, 
donating 4,000 trees this month to U.S. military personnel.<br>
<br>
The 
artificial-tree industry has taken notice. And the handful of U.S. 
manufacturers has started to swing back.<br>
<br>
&quot;The tree farmers have 
definitely been more aggressive with their marketing the past couple of 
years,&quot; said Daniel Hanley, an administrator with Holiday Tree and Trim, 
which points out that it has been making artificial trees for 40 years with 
good ol' American workers in Bayonne, N.J. &quot;But we're really on the same 
side as the tree farmers in terms of not wanting to see American jobs 
overseas.&quot;<br>
<br>
The artificial-tree builders boast a celebrity 
endorser to counter the tree farmers' new friends from &quot;Queer Eye.&quot; 
They recently were the subject of a favorable profile on &quot;Made in 
America,&quot; a Travel Channel program hosted by John Ratzenberger, best known 
for his work as Cliff on &quot;Cheers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hanley disputed the 
farmers' contention that fake trees generally end up in landfills after six to 
10 years of use. &quot;We offer a warranty for 50 years,&quot; he said. 
&quot;We intend for them to be heirlooms, something that is passed down from 
one generation to another.<br>
<br>
&quot;Plus, that means that a tree has not 
been cut down,&quot; Hanley said. &quot;And think of all the pesticides and 
fertilizers that are used to keep that (real) tree going. And it's only going 
to be used for two weeks. Are they all recycled after that?&quot;<br>
