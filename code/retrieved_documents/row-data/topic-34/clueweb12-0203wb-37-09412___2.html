<h2>Real Christmas Trees from Lil' Grandfather Choose and Cut in North Carolina
</h2> 
<p><strong>I hope you enjoy this post by our friend Dr. Jill Sidebottom. 
&nbsp;I may be a bit bias as that is my husband Buddy and our little angel 
Helen!&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, Virginia, It's OK to Use A Real Christmas Tree! </p> In 1897 on this 
date, September 21, the most famous newspaper editorial ever written in the 
English language &quot;Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus&quot; was printed 
in the New York Sun. Editor Francis Church's response to a little girl 
questioning if there was a Santa Claus, has survived more than 100 years. <br>

<br> People today question the use of a real tree to celebrate Christmas. After 
all, isn't it wrong to cut down a tree to use just for a few weeks? Some reason 
that using the same old plastic Christmas &quot;tree&quot; is better for the 
environment. Should we feel guilty about enjoying a real tree? <br>
<br>
In the 
spirit of Francis Church, there is only one response. &quot;Yes, Virginia, it's 
OK to use a real Christmas tree!&quot; After all, the Christmas tree reminds us 
in the dead of winter of the beauty of nature and life. That can't be done with 
a big plastic brush. A fake &quot;tree&quot; was never alive. It never provided 
a perch for a bird or had a butterfly rest on its branches. A deer or bear 
never brushed past it. It never felt the pull of the sun to make it break bud 
and grow. <br>
<br>
So what if it's cut down? Another will be planted in its 
place to provide a home for butterfly and bird. The old tree will be recycled. 
If the family accounted for all the trees cut down for the paper used in the 
household through the year, this use of this one small tree fades into 
insignificance. <br>
<br>
<br>
But the real Christmas tree is not 
insignificant. The scent of it -- the feel of it -- can not be compared to 
plastic. It's role as the center of the Christmas festivities makes it a part 
of the family. As Arthur Sower with the US Forest Service wrote in 1949,&nbsp;
&quot;...<em>there is no reason why the joy associated with the Christmas 
evergreen may not be a means of arousing in the minds of children an 
appreciation of the beauty and usefulness of trees; and keen appreciation of 
the beauty and usefulness of trees is a long step toward the will to plant and 
care for them</em>.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Don't we have enough plastic from 
China already in our lives? Shouldn't a really great Christmas have a great 
real tree?<br>
<br>
So yes, Virginia. It's OK to use a real tree to wait for 
Santa on Christmas Eve. It will make the Jolly Old Elf smile to himself to 
think that not all the traditions of yesteryear have not been forgotten. <br>

<h2>Our neighbor the Blue Ridge Parkway - by Lil' Grandfather Choose and Cut 
</h2> 
<p>One of the many blessings of growing in Laurel Springs, NC was the long 
Sunday drives my family always took North or South on the Blue Ridge 
Parkway.&nbsp; My father is 75 years old and recalls the days when 
the&nbsp;Parkway to be the only paved road in this part of the mountains.&nbsp; 
Whether easing through a&nbsp;foot of snow or driving in and out of clouds of 
heavy fog, the Blue Ridge Parkway is always a stunning reminder of the beauty 
around us here in the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Meadows of Doughton Park!&nbsp; Beautiful place to fly kites! Visiting the 
Blue Ridge Parkway is for the adventurer of any age.&nbsp; We travel with our 
parents, hike the boulder and waterfall trails with our ten year old twin boys 
and chase or 2 year old little girl across the meadows at Doughton Park where 
we often fly kites in the spring and summer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Go for adventure with your family this year! Come up the mountain and enjoy 
one of my favorite National Parks, you may just decide to stay!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Blue Ridge Parkway is many things. It is the longest road 
planned as a single unit in the United States. It is an elongated park, 
protecting significant mountain landscapes far beyond the shoulders of the road 
itself. It is a series of parks providing the visitor access to high mountain 
passes, splendid natural &ldquo;gardens&rdquo; of flowering mountain plants, 
waterfalls and water gaps, deep forests and upland meadows. It is a continuous 
series of panoramic views, the boundaries of its limited right-of-way rarely 
apparent and miles of the adjacent countryside seemingly a part of the 
protected scene. It is a &ldquo;museum of the managed American 
countryside,&rdquo; preserving the rough-hewn log cabin of the mountain 
pioneer, the summer home of a textile magnate, and traces of early industries, 
such as logging railways and an old canal. It is miles of split-rail fence, 
moss on a wood shingle roof, broomcorn and flax in a pioneer garden. It is the 
fleeting glimpse of a deer, a wild turkey or a red fox, or for those who prefer 
their animal life less wild, herds of cows grazing in pastures or horses 
trotting in fields. It is a chain of recreational areas, offering motorists a 
spot to picnic in the woods, a place to sleep overnight in a campground or a 
charming lodge, as well as opportunities to refuel their vehicle, enjoy a meal, 
or purchase a piece of fine regional handiwork. It is the product of a series 
of major public works projects that helped the Appalachian region climb out the 
depths of the Great Depression. The Blue Ridge Parkway is all these things and 
much more, therefore it should come as no surprise that this is the most 
heavily visited unit of the National Park Service.&rdquo; -

<h2>Lil&rsquo; Grandfather Choose and Cut is home to countless species of 
butterflies and bees.</h2>

Pest Management Farm (IPM).&nbsp; By leaving wildflowers and field buffers 
throughout the Christmas trees and horse pastures, we provide habitat for all 
sorts of creatures.&nbsp;Hummingbird moths are one of our favorite inhabitants 
of the farm.&nbsp; They arrive in the flower beds close to dusk and feed on the 
Phlox,monarda, and wild butterfly weed. &nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a shallowtail 
butterfly enjoying a rest on a huge Joe Pye Weed.&nbsp; We are so blessed to 
live in such a diverse and beautiful place!<br>
