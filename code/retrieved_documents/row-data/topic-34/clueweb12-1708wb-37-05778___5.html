<p>Around the first of November, stores already become filled with holiday 
d&eacute;cor, red and green decorations and special holiday sales become 
imminent. The Christmas tree is next and while the majority of people wait 
until after the week of Thanksgiving, some die hard holiday fanatics already 
have at least one in every room of the house. Each year millions of trees, real 
and fake, are pitted up against each other in an ongoing battle to see which is 
best! Like most things in life, people normally feel adamantly one way or the 
other, however &ndash; when it comes to Christmas trees there is nothing better 
than the real thing. Which do you choose, Fake versus Real Christmas Trees?</p> 
<p>If you think back to your grandparents Christmas tree, it was probably some 
gaudy white or pink plastic tree on a pedestal that spun around and played 
Christmas carols. While these were the Christmas fashion back in the day, 
today&rsquo;pre-lit array of pines and furs made from plastic are not much 
better. Some people dismiss the idea of a real tree simply because of the mess 
it leaves behind. Certainly, the falling needles can cause a problem in the 
middle of the living room but there is something reminiscently warm and 
friendly about the smell of pine and the way real trees always have a slight 
imperfection that makes them feel homey. It is true however, that pine needles 
are nothing that a good shop-vac can&rsquo;t pick up and as long as the tree 
skirt is long and you lie plastic on the carpet, the floors should make out 
just fine.</p> 
<p>Other people claim that fake trees versus real Christmas trees are safer to 
have in the home. With all the chlorophylls they are no doubt emitting into the 
indoor air, that is a serious misconception. As far as safer is concerned, 
should the lights on the tree spark a flame the plastic tree is going to melt 
and heat up ten times more quickly than the sappy pine thick with natural 
moisture. Neither are the safest choice and both cause many house fires. Rule 
of thumb is to unplug them at night and never leave them up and on if you are 
not home to supervise. Leaving them plugged in while you are at work is similar 
to cooking your turkey in the oven while you are work; might turn out okay, 
might not!</p> 
<p>Over the years, environmentalists have backed the completely fake Christmas 
tree fad as a way to save the forests. Each year, millions of trees are dumped 
and wrapped in plastic bags, which seems to only inflate the greed of the 
season. While it is unfortunate and sad to see these trees lying on the curb 
waiting for the tree pickup, most communities are recycling them and even 
supplying degradable wraps for the trees so that the whole thing can be used 
again. It is a much more worthy cause to pay attention to how much paper just 
one school throws away in a day or how much junk mail you receive in a month 
than to worry about the cutting of trees for Christmas. When its time to 
replace the fake Christmas tree or up grade it to the coveted 10-foot tree; 
what will happen to the old one? It will sit in a landfill for eons before it 
finally disintegrates and Lord only knows what will happen to the metallic and 
wires intertwined throughout. They may still be around when our 
grandchildren&rsquo;s children are born.</p> 
<p>The best solution across the board is to purchase a real tree that has its 
roots. Many tree farms exist all around the world that allow people to purchase 
pines and furs of all kinds that can be planted in the ground after Christmas. 
With the roots wrapped in a burlap sack and ample water during the time it is 
indoors, the trees can be planted quite successfully in most climates. This 
ensures that the trees are utilized for Christmas, not thrown in the trash and 
most importantly replanted in the environment they love. There is no waste, 
greed and the money you spend on your Christmas tree can actually be reinvested 
in your landscaping. After a few years, you might just be able to build that 
pine tree wall that will block your view of your neighbor&rsquo;s pool where 
they tend to swim naked often. Another bonus for real in the fake versus real 
Christmas tree squabble.</p> 
<p>The Christmas tree tradition is actually one that started thousands of 
years ago during the time of the Romans. The Pagans would decorate their homes 
with wreaths and use fir and pine trees inside their home as a way to celebrate 
the Winter Solstice. Legend says that evergreens would help to ward off evil 
spirits and candles were used to attract the Goddess of good fortune. The 
Winter Solstice was known as the return of the Sun and the evergreens would 
remind the Pagans that Spring and the rebirth of life were just around the 
corner. As Christianity began celebrating the birth of Jesus around the same 
time of year, the two holidays became somewhat intertwined and much of what 
symbolizes Christmas today is actually from the Solstice celebration of the 
Pagans. If they believed that a live tree in and around the home would bring 
them good fortune, good health and invite the sun, both physically and 
metaphorically into their lives; it is good reason to follow ancient wisdom and 
use live trees for Christmas. No matter how many pine-scented candles you leave 
burning around the home, there is nothing more inviting and comforting than the 
smell of a freshly cut (or wrapped) live tree adorning the home during 
Christmas.</p>
