<h1>Day Trip: Christmas Tree Farms in Half Moon Bay and Beyond</h1> 
<h1></h1>  by Kaitlyn Ellison, under Adventure, Day Trips, Family, Half Moon 
Bay, Holiday, North Bay, Peninsula, Sonoma County <br>

<br>

<p>REAL or FAKE?&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been embroiled in&nbsp;this debate&nbsp;for 
years now.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re talking Christmas trees, of course, and which is better for the 
environment. Is it better to cut down more of our already disappearing forests 
or to set up ticking time bombs of chemicals in our living rooms? With&nbsp;
passionate arguments on both sides, it looks like the jury is still out on this 
problem.</p> 
<p>So what&rsquo;s a treehugger to do when it&rsquo;s time to deck the halls? 
Cut your own tree! According to&nbsp;some research, artificial would need to be 
reused for at least 20 years to be greener than buying a fresh-cut tree, while 
cut trees can be&nbsp;recycled. Plus, a visit to one of the many&nbsp;<strong>
Christmas tree farms in Half Moon Bay</strong>makes for fun, festive holiday 
activity.</p> 
<p>Christmas trees grown on cut-your-own-tree farms are renewable, 
biodegradable, and locally sourced. They&rsquo;re carbon neutral, they pump 
oxygen into the environment, and they won&rsquo;t end up in the landfill like 
your fake tree. So grab your coat, boots, and gloves, and get to some holiday 
merrymaking!</p> 
<p>Given the logistics of transporting your tree, we understand that this is a 
trip where it&rsquo;s best to drive. But we&rsquo;ve thrown in a few tips to 
offset your footprint while you&rsquo;re making merry. Here, a few great (and 
green) tree farms.</p> 
<p><strong>The Farm:&nbsp;Rancho Siempre Verde&nbsp;|</strong>2250 Cabrillo 
Highway<strong>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</strong>Pacifica&nbsp;|&nbsp;rsvtrees.com<strong>
<br> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>The Trees:</strong>&nbsp;Douglas Firs, Monterey Pines, Sequoias, 
Incense Cedars, Arizona Cypresses or Swift Silvers are all available for the 
cutting. All trees cost $60, and the farm&rsquo;s expert staff will help you 
tie &nbsp;and load your tree.</p> 
<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s Farm-tastic:&nbsp;</strong>Giant&nbsp;swings, 
marshmallows, and ocean-view picnics are only a few of the fun activities on 
offer at the farm (read about more of them&nbsp;here).</p> 
<p><strong>When to Go:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. 
on all weekends in December.</p> 
<p><strong>Green Tip:&nbsp;</strong>The trees at the &ldquo;always green 
ranch&rdquo; are coppiced or stump cultured, which means a few of the bottom 
branches are left when a tree is cut down, allowing another tree to grow from 
the same stump.</p> 
<p><strong>Directions:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is located at&nbsp;2250 Cabrillo 
Highway (Highway 1).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Farm:&nbsp;Santa&rsquo;s Tree Farm&nbsp;</strong>|78 Pilarcitos 
Creek Road&nbsp;| Half Moon Bay&nbsp;|&nbsp;santastreefarm.com</p> 
<p><strong>The Trees:</strong>&nbsp;This giant tree farm has every type of 
evergreen you could want, from Firs to Redwoods to Monterey Pines.&nbsp;They 
cost between $46 and $69.</p> 
<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s Farm-tastic:&nbsp;</strong>Twenty-two fields of 
green and amazing smells. Plus Santa&rsquo;s workshop, a holiday train, and 
more&nbsp;fun for the whole family). We dare you to get more Christmas-ey than 
that!</p> 
<p><strong>When to Go:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. 
on weekdays and from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. on weekends. Shows, Santa, and the 
Sleighbells Gift Shop are available on weekends only.</p> 
<p><strong>Green Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Opt for a pesticide-free tree, and before 
you go make sure your car is tuned and your trunk empty, which will reduce the 
amount of fuel burned.</p> 
<p><strong>Directions:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is located at&nbsp;78 Pilarcitos 
Creek Road in Half Moon Bay.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Farm:&nbsp;Little Hills Farm</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
|961 Chapman Lane&nbsp;| Petaluma |&nbsp;littlehillschristmastree.com</p> 
<p><strong>The Trees:</strong>&nbsp;Choose from Monterey Pines, Leyland 
Cypresses, and Sierra Redwoods. They cost anywhere from $42 up, and fresh-cut 
trees are also available.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s Farm-tastic:&nbsp;</strong>Kris and Carol Mungle, 
who own and run Little Hills, are all about family. And their farm is about 
family tradition, from their gorgeous trees to their&nbsp;barn animal friends).
</p> 
<p><strong>When to Go:&nbsp;</strong>Little Hills Christmas Tree Farm is open 
from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. on weekends 
(cut your own until 5 p.m. all days). Santa visits on weekends only. If you 
don&rsquo;t find what you like, head down the road to the Mungle&rsquo;s other 
outpost, Liberty Christmas Tree Farm, open 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. on weekends.</p> 
<p><strong>Green Tip:&nbsp;</strong>The folks who run Little Hills Christmas 
Tree Farm and Liberty Christmas Tree Farm down the road are committed to 
sustainability, from pesticide-free planting to recycling and mulching.</p> 
<p><strong>Directions:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is located at&nbsp;961 Chapman 
Lane in Petaluma.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Farm:&nbsp;Valley of the Moon/North Eagle&nbsp;</strong>| 6191 
Sonoma Highway&nbsp;| Santa Rosa |&nbsp;littlehillschristmastree.com</p> 
<p><strong>The Trees:</strong>&nbsp;The farm offers eight varieties including 
firs, pines, redwoods, sequoias, and cedars. Prices range from $35 to $48.</p> 
<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s Farm-tastic:&nbsp;</strong>Part pottery shop, part 
Christmas tree farm, this two-named spot has a Zen quality to it. Apple cider, 
candy canes, and smiles all included. Plus, you can probably knock of some of 
your gift list while you&rsquo;re at it. (Here&rsquo;s how.)</p> 
<p><strong>When to Go:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is open daily, from 9 a.m. until 
dark.</p> 
<p><strong>Green Tip:&nbsp;</strong>A few bottom branches are left when the 
tree is cut, so that a new tree can grow in its place.</p> 
<p><strong>Directions:&nbsp;</strong>The farm is located at&nbsp;6191 Sonoma 
Highway in Santa Rosa.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Keep on Keepin&rsquo; Green</strong></p> 
<p>Most cities will collect Christmas trees curbside after the holidays. There 
are also nonprofits and recycle centers that will take them as well. Check&nbsp;
Earth 911&nbsp;for everything you need to know about &ldquo;tree-cycling.&rdquo;
