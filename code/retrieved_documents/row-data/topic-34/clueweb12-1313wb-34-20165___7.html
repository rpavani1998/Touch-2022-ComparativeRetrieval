<br>  Christmas tree: Real or Fake  False <br>
 General  Christmas tree: Real 
or Fake  Make that room pop! General design &amp;amp; decorating suggestions 
and questions go here, please.  I've always had a fake tree for Christmas, from 
when I was little to now and I wouldn't have it any other way. To me fake trees 
are just easier to maintain, but I do get why people prefer real trees.  0

652116  I've always had a fake tree for Christmas, from when I was little to 
now and I wouldn't have it any other way. To me fake trees are just easier to 
maintain, but I do get why people prefer real trees. For one a lot of people 
enjoy the smell of a real tree or there is some long family tradition behind 
getting one. So of course people like to keep those memories fresh and a live 
so they keep on with the tradition.<br>
<br>
However since I've never had a 
tradition of going out and cutting a tree down for Christmas I don't really 
care for one. Plus they can become a real mess, especially when they are dying. 
Who knows though maybe one day I'll start getting a real tree, like when I have 
my very own nagging kids.<br>
<br>
What does everyone else get in terms of a 
tree? Post your commnets.

Last: 3/27/2012  718978 I have had both fake and real. If you want the 
experience of a real tree stick with&nbsp; your fake tree and light a pine 
candle.. then you will miss out on all the bugs and vacuuming all the needles 
which fall everyday. the branches I believe are heavier with a fake tree.&nbsp; 
It is nice experience to go and chop down a tree and find the perfect one&nbsp; 
but there are several cons:<br>
<br>
1.) Bugs<br>
2.) Sap<br>
3.) Vacuuming 
needles everyday<br>
4.) Having to wrap the tree in a bag and drag is down 
stairs or out a door to the trash. <br>

the tree bowl, the fake ones are a lot less to clean up and store away nicely

730601  Ok, so I came to the party late, but since I have been boxing up my 
fake tree this week, I thought I would weigh in. I always had real trees 
growing up. It was a challenge because my dad was allergic to most of them. We 
had to get douglas fir and they weren't always easy to find and expensive. We 
didn't cut them ourselves, but went to a tree farm. It was a family tradition 
to freeze, though, and haul the sucker home, etc. Our dog would have to be 
stopped from drinking the water, like Dan's. lol Those are good memories, but 
yeah, it was a lot of work.<br>
<br>
When I was in college and couldn't be home 
in time to help, my parents switched to a fake tree. At first it bugged me. I 
really never had it any other way. After a few years, though, I got used to it 
and started liking it.<br>
&nbsp;-It's good to be able to haul it up in pieces 
if you can't get someone to help you.<br>
-It's sturdier. A bunch of the 
Hallmark ornaments were just too heavy for the real tree.<br>
-No dropping 
needles through the house as you bag it and try to haul it away.<br>
-No fire 
hazard if it dries out too quickly but you try to make it last through 
Christmas.<br>
-No frozen toes and nose trying to wander around to find one. 
<br><br>
So, when I get nostalgic, I just think of all that. Maybe if I hit the 
lottery, I'll pay someone to put up a real AND an artificial tree sometime just 
for the memories. ;) LOL<br>
