<h2>O Christmas Tree: Part&nbsp;Two</h2> 8 Jan 
<p>The rest of the story &hellip;</p> 
<p>When the boys and I went to get our real Christmas tree, it didn&rsquo;t go 
exactly as I&rsquo;d thought.</p> 
<p>First, when we got to the farm, the kind man who greeted us showed us four 
different types of trees. He then gave me directions around his lot on where I 
could find the different types, handed me a measuring stick to measure the 
heights of the trees, and gave me a saw.<em>Wait. A saw? I thought <strong>they
</strong> were going to cut down for me. No &hellip; no &hellip; apparently 
</em><strong>I</strong> <em>was going to cut it down.</em></p> 
<p><em></em>So, off we went. I recall thinking to myself: <em>Can I actually 
cut down a tree? What if I can&rsquo;t?</em><em> Oh, you can do this. 
It&rsquo;s just a tree</em>.<em> How hard can it be?</em></p> 
<p><em></em>Well, not that bad actually. We found the type we wanted, and then 
found the tree we wanted. Then I went to sawing it down. The boys thought I 
needed help, but I eventually got it. My knees got muddy and my hands were 
rubbed (a little) raw, but I succeeded in felling the tree and was quite proud 
of myself for doing a new, hard thing and for (hopefully) impressing the boys.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We all helped drag our tree to the truck. I carried into the house. I 
strung it with lights, and the boys added ornaments.</p> 
<p>It seemed tall at the lot, but compared to our 9 foot artificial tree of 
years past, it really wasn&rsquo;t that large. It held less than half of the 
ornaments we usually display.</p> 
<p>It smelled <em>wonderful</em>, and was kinda nice just to do something new 
and different.</p>

<h2>O Christmas&nbsp;Tree</h2> 7 Dec 
<p>Boys in front of the Christmas tree, 2009</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to get a real Christmas tree this year, rather than put 
up our fake one. I want the boys to experience a real tree at least once and to 
see what we think about it as a possible tradition.</p> 
<p>Getting a real Christmas tree isn&rsquo;t just about the tree itself but 
about the tree-acquiring experience.</p> 
<p>When their father and I lived in Indiana we had a real tree twice.&nbsp; 
There was snow all around up there, so it felt very Christmas-y to go to the 
Christmas tree farm. The farm had a small shop with ornaments for sale, a fire 
in the fireplace, and hot cocoa. It just felt like Christmas when you were 
there.</p> 
<p>While I very much enjoyed <em>getting</em> the real tree, getting rid of it 
after the holidays wasn&rsquo;t as easy. The trees come all neatly and tightly 
bundled and thus pretty easy to get in. But once you cut the cord and the 
branches poof out, it&rsquo;s a bigger task to get the tree<em>out</em>.</p> 
<p>The first year we lived in an upstairs apartment and once we were done with 
it we threw it over the balcony to the ground below. A friend picked it up and 
took to his father&rsquo;s pond.</p> 
<p>The next year we were in a house. It was weeks past Christmas, and I 
decided to take the tree out. I could&rsquo;ve dragged it out the back door and 
around the house to the front curb. But doing that in the snow seemed like more 
than I wanted to do. So I decided to drag it out the front door, which meant I 
had to take it down a small corridor between the dining room and the front 
foyer. The dry pine branches and needles were not very gentle to the corridor 
walls, and the walls were badly scratched. The walls had to eventually be 
repainted.</p> 
<p>That night, I woke up to an extremely hot house. It felt like a sauna. I 
went to the thermostat, which was in the corridor where I had taken the tree 
earlier that day, and it was 90+ degrees in the house. I removed the cheap 
plastic cover and inside where pine needles that had lodged in the shut-off 
mechanism and weren&rsquo;t allowing the heater to regulate off and on; it was 
just running constantly. I removed the needles and turned on the A/C. I also 
went outside in the 30-degree weather and left the front door wide open to cool 
me (and the house) down.</p> 
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t funny at the time, but I&rsquo;m able to laugh at it now.
</p> 
<p>So no more real trees after that year. We bought a 9-foot after-Christmas 
clearance special, and that&rsquo;s been our tree for the last 10 years. 
It&rsquo;s starting to show it&rsquo;s wear, and I should&rsquo;ve shopped for 
a replacement after Christmas last year. It&rsquo;s also such a big hassle to 
put on all the limbs and fold out each branch.</p> 
<p>So far the boys aren&rsquo;t too thrilled about going to get a real tree. I 
hope things will be better once we actually get to the farm, pick our tree, 
watch it be hacked down, bundled up and bring it in our home. Certainly 
they&rsquo;ll think the axe they&rsquo;ll use to cut it will be cool, right? 
Can I get some coolness points for that at least?</p>
