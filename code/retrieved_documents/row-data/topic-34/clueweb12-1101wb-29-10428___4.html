Good Neighbors: Outstanding in the Field&rsquo;s Jim 
Denevan <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice when you get an outdoor table at a restaurant on a 
beautiful day; everything seems to taste better. Imagine having a deliciously 
fresh, locally sourced meal served to you on a vineyard, a beach, a mountain, 
or in the middle of a meadow and there&rsquo;s nothing for miles but trees and 
sky, and maybe a wind turbine. This kind of dreamy dining setting is available 
through Outstanding in</p> <br>
10 Best San Francisco Bay Area Bike Rental Shops
<br> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to shell out hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars 
for a flashy bike worthy of the Tour de France in order to enjoy all of the 
beautiful trails that the Bay Area has to offer. Choose to be eco-friendly and 
paycheck-friendly by checking out one of our top 10 bike rental shops in the 
Bay Area. 1. Blazing Saddles | 2715 Hyde Street | San Francisco Boasting</p> 
<br> 10 Best Bay Area Views <br>

<p>Though living in one of the most photographed cities in the world, city 
dwellers have a tendency to forget the unparalleled, natural beauty sitting 
just outside the man-made structures of San Fran proper. Remind yourself why 
your East Coast friends are jealous of your Nor Cal life by taking a good, long 
look at it. Escape the city to visit national parks, restaurants, and vineyards 
for spectacular views of the</p> <br>
Day Trip: Christmas Tree Farms in Half 
Moon Bay and Beyond <br>

<p>REAL or FAKE?&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been embroiled in&nbsp;this debate&nbsp;for 
years now. We&rsquo;re talking Christmas trees, of course, and which is better 
for the environment. Is it better to cut down more of our already disappearing 
forests or to set up ticking time bombs of chemicals in our living rooms? 
With&nbsp;passionate arguments on both sides, it looks like the jury is still 
out on this problem. So what&rsquo;s a treehugger to do when</p> <br>
Off the 
Caltrain: 5 Things to Do in Burlingame <br>

<p>&ldquo;Quaint&rdquo; and &ldquo;residential&rdquo; definitely describe 
Burlingame. &ldquo;Boring,&rdquo; however, does not. Located just a 20-minute 
train or bus ride from San Francisco, downtown Burlingame, with its sundry 
restaurants, shops, and beautiful parks along the water, has the trendy feel of 
Cow Hollow, but with nicer weather and a friendlier atmosphere. Here, five 
things to do in Burlingame</p> <br>
Review: Moss Beach Distillery <br>

<p>On the approach to this Half Moon Bay mainstay, you find yourself wondering 
why there is a restaurant &ldquo;way out here.&rdquo; Then the wow factor hits. 
The Spanish-style building nestled on a craggy cliff above the wild Pacific is 
nothing if not impressive, all the more so when you enter its window-walled 
dining room. And then there&rsquo;s that sometimes sunny, sometimes wind-swept 
(and always pet-friendly) patio, with its cozy blankets,</p> <br>
