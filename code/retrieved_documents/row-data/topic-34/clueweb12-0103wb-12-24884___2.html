 November

<p>  OK, this week I&rsquo;ll get some ranting out of the way so we can 
concentrate on positive things the closer we get to Christmas Tree season.</p>
<p> The rant subject is the &ldquo;debate&rdquo; over whether a fake tree is a 
better eco-choice than a real tree. Quite frankly, it befuddles me that there 
is still a &ldquo;debate&rdquo; at all and that there are consumers out there 
who still think a manufactured product is better for the environment than a 
natural product. But, alas, there is.</p>
<p> Part of the problem is the misleading, and sometimes outright false, 
information put out there. Here&rsquo;san example: This Sears ad for a fake, 
plastic tree describes it as a &ldquo;Just Cut Balsam.&rdquo; What?!?! 
It&rsquo;s not a Balsam, and it wasn&rsquo;t just cut. It was manufactured in a 
factory somewhere, most likely China, then shipped here. You can post a comment 
to Sears about this silly, deceptive product descriptionhere. </p>
<p> Here&rsquo;s another example: in the November/December issue of Mother 
Jones magazine, there&rsquo;s a chart comparing real trees and fake trees. The 
author is Celia Perry. Under the real tree column, in a category called 
&ldquo;Dirty Business&rdquo; it says &ldquo;produce oxygen, but require tons of 
pesticides and herbicides.&rdquo; Now that second part is a totally false 
statement. They do indeed produce oxygen, as all plants do, but do NOT require 
tons of pesticides. No source is cited, and phone calls to Ms. Perry went 
unreturned. Mother Jones&rsquo; tagline says &ldquo;Smart, Fearless 
Journalism&rdquo;....really? Is that why writers just make stuff up?</p>
<p> I was talking with a reporter last week who said a retro aluminum tree had 
these words on it&rsquo;s packaging: &ldquo;Better for the environment because 
no tree has to be cut down.&rdquo; Of course, it comes in a cardboard 
box....the hypocrisy is astounding.</p>

<p> Here&rsquo;s the best example, an article from the Hays Daily News in 
Hays, Kansas.
http://www.hdnews.net/Story/b0623_BC_SPE_Holidays_GreenTr_11_06_0899 . In it, a 
fake tree seller is touting the lower fuel consumption required to transport 
fake trees from Asia if you calculate that over 15 years of using the same 
tree. Uh, really? That doesn&rsquo;t take into account the fuel required to 
ship raw materials such as plastic and metal to the factory in the first place. 
Nor does it take into account the energy consumed by the factory itself. Nor 
does it take into account the fuel consumed to distribute the product from 
shipping ports to retail outlets throughout the U.S. Recently a Christmas Tree 
farmer calculated fuel use to grow his trees. This is a farm in the deep south, 
where mowing is probably required more than other places. He uses 600 gallons 
of fuel per year (both diesel and gasoline) to grow 14,000 trees. That equates 
to 5.5 ounces of fuel per tree per year. How many ounces of petroleum is used 
to make the plastic needles on one fake tree?</p>
<p> Plastic is a product we all use, but many believe will need to be replaced 
soon. A recent article in Spirit Magazine said the U.S. uses 2 million barrels 
of oil every day to make plastic. That represents about 10 percent of the 
nation&rsquo;s total oil consumption. I found that interesting.</p>
<p> Well, to combat some of the misleading, and sometimes outright false, 
information that consumers are exposed to, we put together a simple comparison 
chart. You can see it on the front page or click this link. I&rsquo;m confident 
that sooner, rather than later, consumers will know the truth and know that the 
eco-friendly choice in Christmas Trees is a renewable, recyclable Real Tree 
grown on a farm.</p>
<p> Keep the questions coming...next week we&rsquo;ll start posting consumer 
emails and answers. If there&rsquo;s a topic you&rsquo;d like addressed,write 
to us. </p>
