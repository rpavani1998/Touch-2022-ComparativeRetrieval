<h2>Behavioral Programming: How Our Ethos&nbsp;Work</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Christopher Pepe:</h3> 
<p>Christopher&rsquo;s an all-star developer and partner/consultant with 
Praecipio Consulting and a part of <em>in.gredients</em>&lsquo; founding team.
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h3>Basic programming: how computers make decisions</h3> 
<p>Computers are great at solving certain problems &ndash; and terrible at 
solving others.</p> 
<p>In its classic model the computer was programmed to make a 
&ldquo;choice&rdquo; given a set of rules that are obeyed. If anything changed, 
a program wasn&rsquo;t equipped to adapt. This is great if the computer is, for 
example, playing chess &ndash; it just needs to know the few million possible 
configurations, play out every game to the end in its head, and choose the move 
that means it&rsquo;s most likely to win.</p> 
<p>Many computer programs implement an algorithm or a repeatable set of 
&ldquo;choices.&rdquo; They aren&rsquo;t really choices, though, because the 
computer will choose the same way every time. To get a program to<em>behave</em>
 a particular way it has to be programmed to pick exactly the right path. For 
example, if you&rsquo;re hungry, get some food &ndash; unless you have to go to 
the bathroom, and in that case go to the bathroom first. Given this flow, the 
program will never consider if the house is on fire and will burn up. It will 
also never deviate from its path even if what it &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; 
doesn&rsquo;t make sense given the bigger picture.</p> 
<h3>What&rsquo;s behavioral programming, and why&rsquo;s it different?</h3> 
<p>Behavioral programming, however, is bio-mimicry &ndash; a way of 
programming computers to act more like plants and animals so they&rsquo;re 
better suited to adapt to change. A set of behaviors are programmed in and 
depending on the most pressing need, a behavior emerges. Think ofThe Sims. If 
you&rsquo;re hungry, go get food. But if you have to go to the bathroom food 
may need to wait&hellip; that is, unless the house is on fire. You&rsquo;re 
still limited by the behaviors you&rsquo;ve learned, but are more free to 
choose which behavior best fits your current environment. As the environment 
changes, so may the best choice.</p> 
<h3>So what could this possibly have to do with <em>in.gredients</em>?</h3> 
<p>Glad you asked!</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re often asked how we select our products &ndash; i.e., what 
criteria&rsquo;s most important in choosing products for the store. It&rsquo;s 
hard to say &ldquo;Term A&rdquo; is more important than &ldquo;Term B&rdquo; 
because in the real world few things are so cut-and-dry. Today&rsquo;s world is 
a complex array of terms both positive and negative, often with loose 
definitions like &ldquo;natural.&rdquo; Terms like organic, beyond-organic, 
biodynamic, local, heirloom, sustainable, green, natural, free-range, 
cage-free, pastured, grass-fed, grass-finished, GMO, chemical, big-ag, and 
toxic are thrown around. Organic actually has a legal meaning, but 
there&rsquo;s a lot of variation in how it&rsquo;s applied. Most of the others 
vary wildly in what they mean. Often times, a non-certified organic small farm 
may be a better environmental steward than a large national organic brand. 
It&rsquo;s a complex field to navigate.</p> 
<p>At <em>in.gredients</em> we take each product into consideration and 
inspect it from every angle. Where does it come from, what are the ethos of the 
producer and the rest of the supply chain, are there alternative options we can 
compare it to&hellip;and, like in behavioral programming, make a calculated 
decision based on the decisions unique environment and the variables within it. 
And just like real-life, those variables may change in the future, and our 
decisions may have to react and adjust.</p>

<h2>Grocery Store in Scope, Convenience Store in&nbsp;Scale</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The title says it all &ndash; <em>in.gredients</em> is a microgrocer with a 
broad scope of products in a small, efficient space. It&rsquo;s time to start 
talking about how our store will work and what to expect&hellip; we&rsquo;re 
looking forward to finally opening our doors!</p> 
<p>To start, we&rsquo;ll talk about being a microgrocer by answering some 
recent FAQs&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Are you a specialty store?&rdquo;</strong><br>
 No. Most of 
the time when we think of &ldquo;specialty store&rdquo; we think of a small 
store offering organic spices and nuts and herbs. As the title of this post 
says, we&rsquo;re a &ldquo;grocery store in scope&rdquo; and a 
&ldquo;convenience store in scale&rdquo; &ndash; meaning we&rsquo;ll offer a 
broad selection of food (dairy, meat, produce, breads, household cleaners, 
&hellip;) in a dense, efficient space.</p> 
<p>Think of us as a grocery store for all your basics &ndash; milk, vinegar, 
toothpaste, flour, dishwashing detergent &ndash; as well as some 
&ldquo;special&rdquo; things like beer, wine, chicken feed, seeds, etc.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;So what about product selection?&rdquo;</strong><br>
 
We&rsquo;ll have between one and &ldquo;a couple to a few&rdquo; options for 
every product we carry. The idea is to simplify grocery shopping. We want to 
make it easy for you to find ingredients and easy for you to do things with 
those ingredients.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Why are you a microgrocer? Why not open a bigger 
store?&rdquo;</strong><br>
 We want to be a neighborhood store. Plus, the 
microgrocer model allows<em>in.gredients</em> to easily open in more Austin 
neighborhoods without displacing existing buildings or requiring excess surface 
parking that displaces livable space. There are still many neighborhoods in 
Austin without walkable access to a neighborhood grocer &ndash; and we&rsquo;d 
love to help fix that!</p>

<h2>The Hunt for Seasonal and Local Gets&nbsp;Easier</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<h3>Jessica Malsky:</h3> 
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s an Austin native with a passion for environmental issues 
and an unshakable commitment to improving sustainability. When she&rsquo;s not 
busy blogging for<em>in.gredients</em>, she loves studying ecology, thrift 
store shopping, bees, and riding bicycles!</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Jessica Malsky, the newest member of the&nbsp;<em>
in.gredients</em> team. One of the things I&rsquo;ve become most excited about 
in anticipation of the<em>in.gredients </em>store opening: it&rsquo;ll be so 
much easier to eat seasonal, local, organic/natural, produce. Let me clarify 
&ndash; it&rsquo;ll be easier to eat it because it&rsquo;ll be easier to find 
it! As I&rsquo;m an eco-friendly kind of gal, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;been a personal 
goal of mine for some time to go local and organic, but it&rsquo;s been tough 
going.</p> 
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all too familiar with the fact that the vast majority 
of produce available at most grocery stores isn&rsquo;t locally sourced (in 
part due to the constant consumer demand for non-seasonal produce) &ndash; 
something that kind of gets me down. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ve found that 
even my favorite small, local grocery stores don&rsquo;t have a great selection 
of local and organic produce. Farmers&rsquo; markets seem to be the best bet in 
the hunt for seasonal/local/organic. And while I<em>adore</em>
&nbsp;farmers&rsquo; markets, more often than not my schedule isn&rsquo;t 
compatible with market days and times (unfortunately). Can anyone relate?</p> 
<p>So naturally, I&rsquo;m really excited about the fact that when <em>
in.gredients</em>&nbsp;debuts, it&rsquo;ll be like having a supplementary 
farmers&rsquo; market on call 7 days a week. No joke! In fact, some of the 
farms with booths at Central Texas farmers&rsquo; markets are the ones whose 
produce we&rsquo;ll be carrying. But the window of opportunity to get at these 
farm-fresh goodies will be significantly wider, so no fret if you can&rsquo;t 
make it to market day. Phew!</p> 
<p>You could think of it this way: every day will be market day at <em>
in.gredients</em>!</p>

<h2>Recipe: Caldo Verde (Kale and Potato&nbsp;Soup)</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Caldo Verde is a traditional Portuguese soup with kale, potatoes, and 
sausage or chorizo. It&rsquo;s easy to make, relatively quick, and makes a 
delicious warm meal for a winter day. For this Caldo Verderecipe (from 
allrecipes.com), you&rsquo;ll need these veggies from your local farmer: kale, 
potatoes, onion, and garlic. Aside from farm-fresh veggies, you&rsquo;ll need 
some olive oil and linguica sausage. It&rsquo;ll be ready in an hour!</p> 
<p>Option: While sausage is traditional in this dish, it can be left out for a 
delicious vegan soup!</p>

<h2>Recipe: Chicken Salad with Persimmon, Pecans, and&nbsp;Thyme</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting (and timely) seasonal twist on a classic 
favorite: achicken salad recipe from Healthy Green Kitchen that calls for 
persimmons and pecans. The beauty of this recipe: if you live in Central Texas, 
you can get all the &ldquo;fixins&rdquo; for this salad locally, because as 
y&rsquo;all know, &rsquo;tis the season for persimmons and pecans! What&rsquo;s 
more, it&rsquo;s a great way to use leftover roast chicken or turkey!</p>

<h2>City Wide Composting &ndash; Successful in San&nbsp;Fran!</h2> 
<p>with one comment</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It can be done, folks! Last week the City of San Francisco&rsquo;s solid 
waste and recycling program,Recology, collected its <em>millionth ton</em>
&nbsp;of food scraps from household kitchens and businesses across the city. 
That&rsquo;s a whoppingone million tons of solid waste that&rsquo;s been spared 
from the landfill&nbsp;and put to good use rejuvenating local soil as compost.
</p> 
<p>The absence of one million tons of food scraps &ldquo;saved 2.7 million 
cubic yards of landfill space and produced 600,000 cubic yards of finished 
compost.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s incredible! Major props, San Fran!</p>

<h2>O Christmas Tree! Real or&nbsp;Fake?</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Which is better for the environment, hosting a real Christmas tree or a 
fake one? The answer&rsquo;s pretty complex, with many factors to 
consider&hellip;and it really depends on where you live, so answers will be 
different for people in different parts of the country. The most important 
thing is to do a bit of research, and make your decision based on the facts.</p>
<h3>Fake Trees: benefits and drawbacks</h3> 
<p>Fake trees can last for decades, which is a great considering nothing is 
going to waste during its life-span. It also doesn&rsquo;t take any fossil fuel 
to go and grab the tree from the attic, so it&rsquo;s definitely an 
energy-saver. However, for any tree, real or fake, you have think about where 
it will go at the end of its life cycle. For a fake tree, this could be tricky. 
Most are made of PVC plastic, so they aren&rsquo;t recyclable. The 
eco-conscious solution would be to re-use it some how (toilette brushes? hah!), 
or pass it on to someone else. You could give it to Goodwill, The Salvation 
Army, or maybe put it on Craigslist. But at some point in time, even if 
it&rsquo;s 35 years later, that non-recyclable plastic will have to go to a 
landfill.</p> 
<p>For some folks the fake tree will always be the better option because of 
geographic location, budget, and transportation among other reasons. If 
that&rsquo;s you, there are ways to make this option significantly greener 
(please excuse pun&hellip;). Not all fake trees need be store-bought 
PVC&nbsp;saplings&nbsp;from China. DIY&rsquo;ers what do you say? Can you make 
a cool tree from recycled and reclaimed materials? I bet the possibilities are 
endless! However, if you&rsquo;re not up for such a project, a well-timed trip 
to thrift store could win you a great tree and the satisfaction that it wont be 
seeing the landfill this year.</p> 
<h3>Real trees: benefits and drawbacks</h3> 
<p>The National Christmas Tree Association&nbsp;(NCTA) says that real trees, 
hands-down, are better for the environment. Real trees contain no harmful 
chemicals, are 100% biodegradable, &ldquo;locally-sourced&rdquo; (local in this 
case is &ldquo;grown in the US and Canada&rdquo;), and provide an added benefit 
of storing carbon while they are growing. The NCTA makes a very convincing 
argument for choosing a real Christmas tree, but there are still some drawbacks.
</p> 
<p>Christmas trees, which are usually firs or pines, need to be hauled to 
parts of the country where these species don&rsquo;t grow. Trees are pretty 
heavy, so this could demand a hefty amount of fossil fuel. Additionally, the 
carbon storage feature on real trees is great, but it&rsquo;s counterproductive 
if trees are cut down. Once trees are dead they don&rsquo;t use any CO2, so 
they won&rsquo;t be removing any more carbon from the air. If a tree stores 
&ldquo;x&rdquo; amount of carbon while it&rsquo;s alive, but requires 
&ldquo;y&rdquo; amount of carbon to be hauled to the middle of a desert, then 
the environmental impact totally depends on how big &ldquo;x&rdquo; is compared 
to &ldquo;y.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Some ideas on how to control these variables: choose a type of tree that 
grows in your state, then you know it won&rsquo;t have come far. You could do 
this by cutting down your own tree near your home, or asking the tree vendor 
which kind is the most &ldquo;local.&rdquo; Better yet, you could buy a living 
tree with roots&nbsp;intact&nbsp;and plant it post-Christmas. Or, if 
you&rsquo;re a super-ambitious steward of the environment, consider this 
unconventional idea: check with your local parks and wildlife services to find 
out which trees in the area are considered invasive species and cut one of them 
down!</p> 
<h3>Conclusions</h3> 
<p>Whether you chose a fake tree, real tree, (or no tree?) this year, knowing 
the facts will help you arrive at the best eco-friendly solution. And who 
knows? A little creativity and thinking out side the box could introduce some 
new and exciting holiday traditions!</p>

<h2>Want to Raise Chickens? Things to&nbsp;Consider</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Thinking of getting some chickens for your backyard or garden? As with all 
things, there are pros and cons to consider. Having lots of yummy fresh eggs is 
such a wonderful treat, but before you put up your coop, determine whether
raising chickens is right for you.</p> 
<p>From legal restrictions to space requirements to weather factors, there are 
lots of things to take into consideration. But not to worry, for those of you 
who can&rsquo;t keep feathered friends,<em>in.gredients</em> will have your 
back. When we open, you can count on us for delicious, responsibly-raised local 
eggs!</p>

<h2>If Organic isn&rsquo;t an&nbsp;Option&hellip;</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Organic produce is the way to go when it&rsquo;s available at your local 
grocer (it will be at<em>in.gredients</em>!) &ndash; but what should you do 
when it&rsquo;s not? TheEnvironmental Working Group (EWG) says that you should 
still eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, because their health benefits 
out-weigh the risk of pesticide exposure. Be wary though! Some fruits and 
vegetables carry with them more pesticide contamination than others.</p> 
<p>You can decrease your likelihood of chowing down on pesticides by using the 
EWG&rsquo;s Shopper&rsquo;s Guide to Pesticides in Produce. Fruits and veggies 
listed in &ldquo;The Dirty Dozen&rdquo; tend to be pretty 
&ldquo;chemically&rdquo; and are best to avoid when they aren&rsquo;t available 
as organic. Check out &ldquo;The Clean 15&Prime; though, where you&rsquo;ll 
find some safer, less contaminated options.</p>
