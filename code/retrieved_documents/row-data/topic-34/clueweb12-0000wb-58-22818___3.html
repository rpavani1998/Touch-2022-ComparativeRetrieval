<h3>Are Green Electronics Jumbo Shrimp?</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>There have been many interesting and promising inventions that have come 
out of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) over this past week. &nbsp;No matter 
what you feel about electronics, they are here in our lives and only gaining in 
numbers. &nbsp;Smart phones,&nbsp;iPods,&nbsp;gameboys, laptops, microwaves, 
TVs, DVD players,&nbsp;yadda&nbsp;yadda&nbsp;yadda... The graph below is a 
clear depiction of the increasing number of electronics in our lives and the 
increasing speed of adoption. &nbsp;This is a graph I find very fascinating and 
have posted at my desk.&nbsp;</p>

 While I don't think that 
electronics are the only answer, I do think they could be part of the solution 
for many&nbsp;Arlingtonians. &nbsp;Often if something isn't easy, fun or saves 
money -- people won't adopt it.&nbsp;Electric bicycles, &nbsp;smart grid 
technologies,&nbsp; eBooks,&nbsp; OLED&nbsp;TVs &nbsp;and&nbsp; portable solar 
chargers&nbsp;are not only easy but cool. <br>
<br>
 We commented earlier about 
&nbsp;the imperfect decision between a real Christmas Trees vs. a fake 
Christmas tree in&nbsp;this post. &nbsp;I feel a similarly&nbsp;about 
technology that is supposed to help us leave a lighter footprint on the 
environment. &nbsp;Theoretically these devices offer us the opportunity to use 
less power, but at what cost? &nbsp;It is a nearly impossible equation for the 
average consumer to figure out. &nbsp;Is it better to keep the TV you have even 
if it uses more power rather than switch to an&nbsp;OLED&nbsp;TV that sips 
energy but requires the extraction, processing, manufacturing, and 
transportation of an entirely new product?!<br>
<br>
 What do you think? 
&nbsp;Is &quot;green technology&quot; as much of an oxymoron as jumbo shrimp? 
Is technology part of the solution or part of the problem? &nbsp;Or is there 
something else that strikes you about our everyday conundrums? &nbsp; <br>
