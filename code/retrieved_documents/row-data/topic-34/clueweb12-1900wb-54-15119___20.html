<h2>Celebrating Humanity in the&nbsp;Environment</h2> April 30, 2012 By Holly 
Fretwell 3 Comments <br>

<p>A curious model for conservation is taking the stage. It is grounded in 
protecting landscapes and species but adds humans to the mix. Though not a new 
idea, it is often dismissed, even discouraged, by environmental thinkers. This 
conservation ethic has the power to enhance resource stewardship and 
environmental quality.</p> 
<p>The new paradigm acknowledges humans as an important part of nature and is 
grounded in a realistic view of the state of the world. The resilience of 
nature is recognized with an understanding that some places are more fragile 
than others. The idea concedes that increased conservation will come when 
people personally recognize the benefits. This ethic has been supported by 
three iconic conservation players.</p> 
<p>Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, was raised in a logging 
community and earned a PhD in resource ecology and forestry. &ldquo;The central 
teaching of ecology is that we are part of nature and interdependent with 
it,&rdquo; writes Moore in his 1995 book,<em>Pacific Spirit</em>. He believes 
that both protected forests and managed forests involve human action, which can 
enhance the benefits provided to society.</p> 
<p>Fifteen years after its founding, Moore parted with Greenpeace. He was 
disturbed by the misinformation that was being disseminated and the 
unwillingness of organization leaders to compromise to work toward realistic 
solutions. Abject opposition to logging is one case in point. Stiff regulations 
can make forests a liability by decreasing permissible harvest and increasing 
management costs. Moore sees the forest and the trees that provide habitat, 
ecosystem services, and wood products. Trees are renewable and through proper 
forest management we can harvest timber while enhancing environmental quality.
</p> 
<p>Using statistical information Bjorn Lomborg, a statistician, has 
systematically analyzed global environmental issues. As a student, Lomborg was 
pessimistic about the future of the environment. He also was once a Greenpeace 
supporter. Following years of data collection and analysis, Lomborg changed his 
tune. &ldquo;We are not overexploiting our renewable resources,&rdquo; he 
writes in his 2001 book,<em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>. Though we 
often hear otherwise, his analysis shows that global forest coverage has not 
changed much in the last 50 years. He also believes that &ldquo;there do not 
seem to be any serious problems with the nonrenewable resources.&rdquo; 
Although some regions are better cared for than others, there are more reasons 
for optimism than pessimism. Lomborg concludes that we are living in a 
healthier, wealthier, and cleaner environment than ever before thanks to human 
innovation.</p> 
<p>Similar to Lomborg and Moore, Peter Kareiva puts humans at the center of 
conservation. Kareiva is the&nbsp;chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy, 
the world&rsquo;s largest conservation organization. He sees a global landscape 
that has been touched by humans. The only conservation that makes sense to 
Kareiva is one that considers human needs and desires. &ldquo;Protecting 
biodiversity for its own sake has not worked,&rdquo; he co-writes in the Fall 
2011 issue of<em>Breakthrough Journal</em>. To enhance conservation in 
today&rsquo;s world requires us to &ldquo;embrace human development&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;to integrate the value of nature&rsquo;s benefits into [corporations] 
operations and cultures.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It is time for conservationists from all walks to shed old paradigms of 
doom and gloom and look at the world as it really is. Though humans have 
touched nearly every place on earth, our increased prosperity has brought
enhanced environmental quality. We are all a part of nature and nature will be 
as we steward it. Therefore, incentives for conservation must be aligned with 
human needs and good stewardship.</p>

<h2>Where Free Markets Meet&nbsp;Faith</h2> March 22, 2012 By PERC 1 Comment 
<br> 
<p>In contrast to the historical ideal of Manifest Destiny, in which the 
conquest of the land was held to be a biblical right imbued to God&rsquo;s 
loyal followers, a contemporary breed of religious practitioners are working to 
combine faith and ecology in new ways. Often found under the movements entitled 
&ldquo;ecotheology&rdquo; or &ldquo;green faith,&rdquo; religious practitioners 
of all denominations and creeds are acting to conserve what they consider to be 
God&rsquo;s creation, following tenets many believe are already in line with 
their religious practices.</p> 
<p>PERC Enviropreneur Institute graduates Fletcher Harper (&lsquo;07) and 
Stacey Kennealy (&lsquo;10) are looking to these religious groups to take 
action and work toward improving environmental quality. While there 
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much in common between those placing their faith in 
markets and those putting faith in the divine, Harper and Kennealy&rsquo;s 
interfaith coalition, GreenFaith, recognizes that incentives matter.</p> 
<p>GreenFaith&rsquo;s mission is to inspire, educate, and mobilize people of 
religious backgrounds to protect the earth as a moral and sacred 
responsibility. As Paul Schwennesen writes in the latest issue of<em>PERC 
Reports, </em>however, &ldquo;simply insisting that people &lsquo;do 
what&rsquo;s right&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t capture the full measure of 
GreenFaith&rsquo;s work; the group calls for their members to address the 
mundane as well as the celestial. Values need to be specific and 
actionable.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Thus, GreenFaith has used lessons garnered from PEI to attract new 
congregations to their Certification Program by touting the benefits of 
financial savings, as well as engaging new and younger members. The major force 
driving GreenFaith&rsquo;s success, therefore, has not been morals, but the 
promise of growth &ndash; and this strategy is having success.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;In the end, GreenFaith isn&rsquo;t just about teaching people that 
God wants a healthy environment,&rdquo; said Harper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about 
mobilizing the faith-based sector &ndash; one of the largest social networks in 
the country &ndash; to make it actually happen. PERC has helped us understand 
new tools and perspectives on how to achieve this goal.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Who Owns the Truffula&nbsp;Forest?</h2> March 2, 2012 By Holly Fretwell 3 
Comments <br>

<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em>The Lorax</em>, a Dr. Seuss classic, is hitting the big screen this 
weekend. The Lorax is an odd, little character that intrepidly opposes a thneed 
manufacturing plant (whatever that is!) run by the Oncelor.</p> 
<p>Similar to most environmental story plots, this one has a good 
environmentalist, the Lorax, that holds the moral high ground and a bad, 
greedy, profit mongering, capitalist, the Oncelor. In this story the Oncelor 
produces thneeds that appear to be in high demand. During production he clear 
cuts every last Trufulla tree, smogs the air, and clogs the water. As a result 
of the Oncelor&rsquo;s insensitive activities the Brown Bar-ba-loots go hungry 
for there is no more Truffala fruit, the Swomee Swans can no longer croak a 
note, and the gills of the Humming Fish have become gummed. All in the name of 
profit. This, in the end, is also lost because the Oncelor puts himself out of 
business by extricating every last Truffala tree which are a needed input for 
thneed production.</p> 
<p>In his strategy to garner attention for conservation, Dr. Suess misses the 
fundamental motivator: incentives. Industry and profit are not necessarily bad 
and harmful to the environment. Environmental problems are the result of 
conflicting demands on resources. Given well specified rights, negotiation will 
motivate the highest valued resource use. If the Truffala forest was open 
access for anyone to cut, it is possible that the Oncelor and others would race 
to harvest every last tree. Given ownership, however, the Oncelor is more 
likely to invest in future trees to ensure the possibility of future 
production. Weyerhaeuser, for example, is proud to announce that they plant 
millions of trees every year. They do so not to prove their conservation ethic, 
rather as an investment in timber for future production.</p> 
<p>A bit of green PR doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either. The&nbsp;list of movie 
sponsors&nbsp;is a bit surprising, to say the least. As you can imagine, the 
motivator of many of these sponsors is not just good green ethics as much as 
good for the bottom line. And that&rsquo;s OK. If you want to change behavior, 
change the incentives. Profit is a good motivator. If you want to understand 
the fundamentals of environmental problems look at the property rights and 
follow the incentives. Well specified property rights encourage long-term 
stewardship and ensure accountability. That is the moral of my story.</p> 
<p>I have not yet seen &ldquo;The Lorax&rdquo; movie but will think about how 
the storyline may differ given well specified property rights when I do. 
Indeed, the global trend over several decades has been better property rights, 
more&nbsp;economic freedoms, and increased prosperity. I do care about the 
environment, both near and far. And I see things getting better, they really 
are!</p>

<h2>Trade a&nbsp;Tortoise</h2> February 27, 2012 By Laura Huggins Leave a 
Comment <br>

<p>Two years ago in <em>PERC Reports</em> Todd Gartner wrote about his efforts 
at &ldquo;helping the American Forest Foundation develop a market-based habitat 
credit trading system in portions of Georgia and Alabama. The incentive-based 
framework will complement other efforts in the region to keep the eastern 
population of the gopher tortoise off the Endangered Species list.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Today, Gartner, in collaboration with Josh Donlan and James Mulligan of 
Advanced Conservation Strategies, are ready to launch their first pilot 
transactions.</p> 
<p>Here is how the gopher tortoise candidate conservation marketplace is being 
designed and piloted:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An interested and eligible private landowner (the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) 
receives a negotiated payment to conserve, manage, or restore longleaf pine 
forests capable of supporting healthy populations of gopher tortoises on his or 
her property. In so doing, the landowner generates gopher tortoise habitat 
credits.</li> 
<li>The entity paying the landowner (the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo;) receives the 
habitat credits in return. The buyer may use the credits to offset the impact 
on gopher tortoise habitat elsewhere, in order to meet a voluntary net zero 
biodiversity impact commitment.&nbsp; Or, the buyer can save the credits for 
later use to meet offset requirements if the species is listed under the ESA. 
Other buyers may purchase credits simply to spur gopher tortoise conservation.
</li> 
<li>A gopher tortoise habitat credit is the currency that can be bought and 
sold. The number of credits on a parcel of land is determined via a 
science-based and peer-reviewed method to ensure a net conservation benefit for 
the tortoise when used as offsets for future impacts. The credit price includes 
funds to manage and monitor the habitat, along with a negotiated profit margin 
for the seller.</li> 
<li>The USFWS approves the crediting methodology and maintains agreements with 
buyers and sellers. The agency may also provide federal-level assurances to 
both the buyer and seller. This regulatory certainty allows buyers to 
preemptively buy credits that can be used toward offsetting future impacts if 
the species were to be listed.</li> </ul> 
<p>With 87 percent of southern forests in private ownership, protecting 
species like the gopher tortoise requires an innovative&nbsp;approach. The 
gopher tortoise conservation marketplace is testing a new&nbsp;strategy, which 
provides&nbsp;financial incentives to private landowners who manage their 
woodlands for habitat and candidate species.</p>

conservation, such as the approach Gartner began formulating as a

<h2>The 10,000 Mile&nbsp;Diet</h2> February 8, 2012 By Laura Huggins <br>

<p><em>Publishers Weekly</em> recommends <em>The Locavore&rsquo;s Dilemma: In 
Praise of the 10,000 Mile Diet</em>, co-authored by former PERC fellows Pierre 
Desrochers and Hiroko Shimizu, as a book to watch for in 2012.</p> 
<p>Check out Shimizu&rsquo;s piece in&nbsp; <em>PERC Reports</em> where she 
outlines&nbsp;three myths about eating local.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Myth 1: </strong>Eating locally produced food reduces our 
environmental impact.</li> 
<li><strong>Myth 2:</strong> Local food is inherently safer.</li> 
<li><strong>Myth 3:</strong> Local food promotes economic growth and social 
justice.</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;In short, the best way to reduce the carbon footprint of 
agricultural production is to produce food where it can be done most 
efficiently and to engage in international trade. Selecting food based on its 
affordability, availability, and quality is a better way to help the planet 
than focusing on food miles.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Hunting Endangered&nbsp;Species</h2> January 30, 2012 By Laura Huggins <br>
<p>The scimitar horned oryx, the addax, the dama gazelle &ndash; endangered 
animals one would expect to encounter in Africa. Yet, as some Texas ranches are 
proving, helping to bring back large numbers of these endangered species can be 
a profitable pastime. As this&nbsp;60 Minutes segment shows, by allowing a 
number of these animals to be hunted for a high price, exotic wildlife ranches 
have achieved a major feat in wildlife conservation. A billion dollar industry, 
supporting more than 14,000 jobs, exotic ranches have worked to bolster the 
populations of approximately 125 different endangered species.</p> 
<p><br>
 The funds collected from hunting a small percentage of the endangered 
animals gives ranchers the money they need to continue to run their ranches. 
Thus, hunting endangered species in Texas has provided economic incentives for 
ranchers to continue to conserve and protect the species.</p> 
<p>Read Terry Anderson and Shawn Regan&rsquo;s&nbsp;article, &ldquo;Shoot an 
Elephant, Save a Community,&rdquo; to see how assigning economic value to 
animals in Africa is also working to conserve wildlife.</p>

<h2>The Case for Economics and the&nbsp;Environment</h2> January 6, 2012 By 
Laura Huggins <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t miss Gernot Wagner&rsquo;s latest piece in the <em>Washington 
Post</em>. Wagner teaches at Columbia, is the author of <em>But Will the Planet 
Notice? How Smart Economics Can Save the World</em>, and is an economist at the 
Environmental Defense Fund.</p> 
<p>Wagner points out that it has become acceptable to say that markets 
don&rsquo;t work, just look at &ldquo;the demise of Lehman Brothers and the 
subsequent swoon of the global economy.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The next time you hear someone say this, you can tell them they&rsquo;re 
wrong for two reasons: Lehman Brothers is more asymptom of what happened rather 
than the underlying cause, and it was guided by much larger forces than itself. 
Markets, in fact, work all too well. They are an aggregator of wishes and 
desires, however misguided they may be.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Furthermore, how can we say that markets don&rsquo;t work when&nbsp;we are 
&ldquo;far from having anything approaching a free market?&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Fossil fuel subsidies and various other loopholes and distortions make the 
playing field uneven. More significantly, we violate one of the most basic 
tenets of economics, that there is no free lunch. In reality, it turns out, we 
all get a steady stream of free passes. It starts in the financial sector, 
where the benefits of bankers&rsquo; actions are often and almost entirely 
privatized: They pocket the bonus if the bet pays off. But the costs are 
socialized: Bankers pay but a tiny fraction of the costs of their failed bets; 
society pays. The fundamental mismatch, as evidenced by the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers, has enormous consequences for the rest of us.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So what can be done? Perhaps more people should study economics. When 
people think about economics, Wagner writes, &ldquo;their minds turn to 
business and finance. But economics goes beyond these fields, and the 
difference between business and economics goesbeyond size.&rdquo; Economics is 
about a way of thinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Economics is organized common 
sense,&rdquo; and as Wagner points out,<strong>&nbsp;&rdquo;If there is 
anything we need right now to guide our economy and the planet out of this dual 
malaise, it&rsquo;s more common sense.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<h2>Happy Holidays and Merry&nbsp;Christmas!</h2> December 15, 2011 By Terry 
L. Anderson <br>

<h1>&nbsp;<strong> &lsquo;Tis The Season</strong></h1> 
<p>When PERC opened its doors in 1980, free market environmentalism (FME) was 
considered an oxymoron; environmentalists saw markets as an enemy, not an ally. 
Now, thanks to PERC, the largest and oldest think-tank focusing on market 
solutions to environmental problems, FME is being tried and tested around the 
world. In Africa, private land owners are protecting rhinos from poaching; in 
the Caribbean an alumnus of PERC&rsquo;s Enviropreneur Institute (PEI) is 
working to help replant and regenerate dying coral reefs; and in the Gulf of 
Mexico, the Environmental Defense Fund has joined PERC in campaigning for 
property rights solutions to overfishing.</p> 
<p>At 45&deg;N and 4,820 feet elevation, <strong>PERC needs your help to keep 
its dedicated PERC staff warm this winter season!&nbsp;</strong> Your 
tax-deductible gift will help fund innovative research, convene conferences, 
publish the results in<em>PERC Reports</em> and other venues, and add to the 
growing number of environmentalists implementing PERC&rsquo;s ideas.</p> 
<p>Here are some specific things that your donation to PERC can accomplish:</p>
<ul> 
<li>$25 will cover the cost of producing and distributing <em>PERC Reports</em>

<li>$2,000 will provide a scholarship for a student to participate in 
PERC&rsquo;s summer programs;</li> 
<li>$5,000 will pay for a Lone Mountain Fellowship, which brings a professor 
to visit PERC;</li> 
<li>$15,000 will give an environmental entrepreneur an opportunity to attend 
PEI and learn to apply FME to their work.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>I assure you that your tax-deductible contribution will promote 
environmental quality with less government and more individual freedom</strong>
. Now is the moment when improving the environment by&nbsp;utilizing property

<h2>Christmas Trees: Real or&nbsp;Fake?</h2> December 8, 2011 By Holly Fretwell
<br> 
<p>It is the time of year for the seasonal debate over the family Christmas 
tree: live or artificial? A live tree means removing a tree from the forest, or 
tree plantation, as it may be. A fake tree is usually an import from a foreign 
factory.</p> 
<p>About&nbsp;30 million live Christmas trees&nbsp;are sold in the US every 
year. That is a lot of trees. But do not fear! Our Christmas tree harvesting 
activities result in growing more trees, not less.&nbsp;Two or three seedlings 
are planted&nbsp;for nearly every single Christmas tree cut. Christmas&nbsp;
tree plantations cover 350,000 acres&nbsp;of land in the US and are growing 
about 350 million trees. As long as people continue to demand a fresh tree at 
Christmas, farmers will continue to provide them.</p> 
<p>While it is still popular in some regions, such as here in Montana, to head 
to the local National Forest to cut a tree, the majority of Christmas trees are 
grown on tree farms. Regardless, Forest Service permits to harvest a tree are 
issued to help manage the forest under agency guidelines.</p> 
<p>At seasons end, real&nbsp;trees can be recycled&nbsp;and used for making 
everything from mulch to medicines, or to enhance wildlife habitat and prevent 
erosion. They can be cut into firewood and burned for home heat or as the 
centerpiece for your next weenie roast. They are even used as biomass to create 
energy.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, you can buy a fake tree that is probably made in China. 
Artificial trees are not biodegradable, nor are they a good fuel source.</p> 
<p>If Christmas is your holiday and you desire a tree, buy your Christmas tree 
with pride knowing that by purchasing a tree you are helping to plant several 
more.</p>

<h2>Q&amp;A with Steven Medema on the Coase Theorem and 
Environmental&nbsp;Economics</h2> November 30, 2011 By PERC <br>

<p>There has been plenty of confusion surrounding the work of Ronald Coase 
since his article &ldquo;The Problem of Social Cost&rdquo; appeared in 1960 
&ndash; so much, in fact, that two scholarswrote in 1992 that the so-called 
Coase theorem has &ldquo;generated a negative externality for 
economists.&rdquo; To clear up some of the confusion, we talked with Steven 
Medema for the next installment of PERC&rsquo;s Q&amp;A series.</p> 
<p>Few know more about the legendary economist and his impact on economic 
thought thanSteven Medema. He is the author of many books and scholarly 
articles on the history of twentieth-century economics, with an emphasis on the 
work of Ronald Coase. His latest book,<em>The Hesitant Hand: Taming 
Self-Interest in the History of Economic Ideas</em>, was awarded the 2010 Book 
Prize by the European Society for the History of Economic Thought.</p> 
<p>Medema is a professor of economics at the University of Colorado Denver and 
a 2011 PERCLone Mountain fellow. For more of PERC&rsquo;s Q&amp;As, see the 
series archive.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Ronald Coase&rsquo;s 1960 article on &ldquo;The Problem of 
Social Cost&rdquo; had a tremendous impact on economics, including PERC&rsquo;s 
work</strong><strong>on free market environmentalism</strong><strong>. What is 
the &ldquo;Coase theorem&rdquo; and how has it evolved in economic thought?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: The Coase theorem tells us that if property rights over 
the relevant resources are well-defined and the costs of transacting are zero, 
parties who disagree over the use of those resources will negotiate to an 
efficient solution, regardless of to whom the property rights are assigned. The 
upshot of the theorem is that private negotiations or other market-like 
processes can efficiently resolve social cost (&ldquo;externality&rdquo;) 
problems such as those associated with air and water pollution. Of course, 
transaction costs are never zero, and much of the discussion of the theorem 
over the years has attempted to work out the possibilities and limitations of 
negotiated solutions when transaction costs are positive. Though much of the 
early reaction to the theorem was negative, the discussion has evolved into one 
that focuses somewhat less on the theorem per se (that is, with its highly 
restrictive assumptions) and somewhat more on departures from these conditions 
and how Coase-theorem-like processes may be operative under more realistic 
conditions.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Over the years, people have come to refer to a hypothetical 
world of zero transaction costs as a &ldquo;Coasian world.&rdquo; Is this view 
accurate?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: Those who refer to such a world haven&rsquo;t read 
Coase very closely. The world of zero transaction costs is a fiction&mdash;but 
a sometimes useful fiction, not unlike a vacuum in physics. It was also a 
bedrock assumption of mainstream economics for ages, including of the economics 
against which Coase was reacting in &ldquo;The Problem of Social Cost.&rdquo; 
What Coase showed was that, in the world of neoclassical economics, government 
regulation was unnecessary for an efficient resolution of social cost problems. 
If property rights are assigned over the resources in question and there are no 
costs of transacting, the parties will efficiently resolve the problem through 
negotiation. So, Pigovian remedies are unnecessary in a Pigovian (costless 
transacting) world. But Coase&rsquo;s emphasis was on the fact that the costs 
of transacting are<em>not</em> zero, and nor are the costs associated with 
government action to deal with social cost problems. The evaluation of how 
society should deal with such problems thus involves a comparison of the 
benefits and costs of alternative courses of action&mdash;including the 
possibility of allowing the problem to persist if the costs of 
&ldquo;curing&rdquo; it are worse than the disease itself.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: We hear a lot about the Coase theorem in environmental 
economics. How has the Coase theorem impacted discussions of environmental 
economics and environmental policy?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: I think that its central impact has been in the way of 
making scholars&mdash;and later policy makers&mdash;aware of the possibility of 
using the exchange process to deal with social cost issues. Of course, the 
Coase theorem is an idealized construct that does not reflect the world in 
which we live. But by showing how property-rights-based solutions can generate 
private, efficiency-enhancing moves, the theorem opened the door to the 
subsequent analysis of exchange solutions in the real world, and thus to both 
theories and policies that employ such a framework.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: You suggest that the Coase theorem is widely recognized among 
environmental economists and taught in most textbooks, yet its relevance is 
often viewed as extremely limited. Why is this so? Why then are so many 
environmental economists interested in Coase?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: &nbsp;My sense is that most environmental economists 
see Coase as important because he emphasized that social cost problems are 
ultimately problems related to incomplete property rights. This makes 
Coase&rsquo;s analysis the natural starting point for the analysis of social 
cost issues. The rub comes in where one goes from there. Some continue to hew 
to what we might call a &ldquo;Pigovian&rdquo; line&mdash;emphasizing that 
regulatory mechanisms or taxes are necessary to correct the problem&mdash;while 
others are more interested in exploring whether markets or market-like 
mechanisms can be utilized to resolve the problem. But there is broad general 
agreement that social cost problems have their roots on the property rights 
side, and this viewpoint owes to Coase.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Discussions of environmental economics often center around 
externalities. Coase avoids this term. How has Coase&rsquo;s work influenced 
the way we think about external costs?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: My sense is that, at a minimum, he impressed upon some 
that social cost problems, or externalities, are reciprocal in nature. One can 
view this in two ways. First, it takes two to tango. That is, if A is 
generating smoke that harms B, B may be said to be as much the 
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; of the harm as A, since B could mitigate damages by, e.g., 
moving away. Second, A may be imposing harm on B, but to restrain A&rsquo;s 
activity in favor of B is to impose harm on A. Some see this as a 
&ldquo;right-wing&rdquo; sort of point, but it is not. It actually has a long 
history in jurisprudence and was held by none other than J.R. Commons, a 
prominent Institutionalist economist and Progressive in who worked during the 
first half of the twentieth century. But value judgments often get in the way 
of sound reasoning when it comes to things like externalities, so not everyone 
has gotten on board with Coase&rsquo;s notion of reciprocity.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Critics of Coase often contend that transaction costs in markets 
are too high for Coasian-type bargaining to occur: negotiations can be costly, 
multiple parties can be affected, and information is diffuse. This is no doubt 
often the case, yet transaction costs are also present in the political 
process. How do these costs affect the way we understand Coase&rsquo;s 
relevancy to environmental policy?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: If one adopts an efficiency-based perspective on these 
things, the point to be taken is that there is no such thing as a determinate 
optimal solution to social cost problems. One can only come to grips with these 
things on a case-by-case basis, weighing the benefits and costs associated with 
alternative courses of action and recognizing that both markets/exchange and 
government activity have associated with them certain costs&mdash;often 
substantial. Coase is not about the Coase theorem; he was a strong advocate of 
comparative institutional analysis and that, at a minimum, economic benefits 
and costs have an important role to play in evaluating policy options. With 
this came a great concern about the costs associated with government 
action&mdash;costs that he (rightly) believed had been underplayed or ignored 
in the theory and practice of social cost policy.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Why are concerns about equity so prominent in environmental 
discussions of Coase?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: Probably because Coase focused so heavily on 
efficiency. But there was good reason for this&mdash;it was the language in 
which the welfare economics of social cost issues had been discussed for a 
half-century. And as we all know, there are plenty of occasions when the 
dictates of efficiency collide with some people&rsquo;s sense of what is 
&ldquo;right.&rdquo; The very possibility that the &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of 
pollution should bribe the factory owners to reduce their pollution levels is 
anathema to many. Interestingly, though, Coase talks about larger concerns 
(&ldquo;aesthetics and morals&rdquo;) toward the end of &ldquo;The Problem of 
Social Cost.&rdquo; But since most readers failed to pay attention to his 
arguments beyond the Coase theorem material (the first 15 pages of a 44-page 
article), they didn&rsquo;t seem to notice this.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: What can we take away from Coase&rsquo;s work and apply to the 
area of free market environmentalism?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: I believe that there are two key insights. The first is 
that markets/exchange<em>can</em> work to resolve certain social cost issues. 
The question is which ones, and this can only emerge from careful and patient 
study. The second is that neither markets nor government are panaceas. Both 
generate imperfect solutions, and the question is that of which of these 
imperfect solutions is best for dealing with the problem at hand. This, too, 
can only be determined from careful and patient study. Unfortunately, too many 
economists and policy makers do not want to hear such things. But &ldquo;create 
markets&rdquo; or &ldquo;we need government to solve the problem&rdquo; takes 
us nowhere. These are difficult problems, and we seldom find that difficult 
problems have easy solutions.<strong></strong></p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t Bother with &ldquo;The Darwin&nbsp;Economy&rdquo;</h2> October 
26, 2011 By Terry L. Anderson <br>

<p>I purchased&nbsp;<em>The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition, and the 
Common Good</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Robert Frank&nbsp;thinking I would learn 
something. I did. I learned that I should not have purchased it.</p> 
<p>Frank takes a very simple game theory used to explain the arms race (and 
naively applies it to elk antlers, arguing that one elk grows big antlers and 
gets all the cows so that others must also grow such big ones to compete), 
applies it to market competition, and&nbsp;concludes that competition can lead 
to bad things for the group as a whole.&nbsp; In the case of elk, he claims 
that large elk antlers make elk as a species worse off because the antlers make 
it difficult for the bull elk to run through the woods and therefore more 
susceptible to wolf predation; obviously he has never seen a bull lay his head 
back so that the antlers are tucked neatly against his back and ribs and run 
through the thickest trees; never seen a bull use the antlers for defense 
against wolves; and doesn&rsquo;t ask how it is that elk are thriving by moving 
to more open spaces in the presence of wolves&ndash;spaces which they occupied 
before human pressure moved them to the mountains. Finally, Frank argues that 
taxes can fix the problems&ndash;and yes, of course, most importantly the 
problem of global warming. No data, no theory, no knowledge of wild species, 
but lots of rhetorical arguments.</p>

<h2>Q&amp;A with Bruce Yandle on Economics and the&nbsp;Environment</h2> 
August 29, 2011 By PERC <br>

<p>This week&rsquo;s Q&amp;A is with Bruce Yandle, a distinguished professor 
at Clemson University and George Mason University and a senior fellow atPERC. 
Yandle&rsquo;s contributions to the field are numerous. He was one of the early 
pioneers of environmental economics as a distinct sub-discipline in the 1970s 
and has authored or edited 14 books on regulation and environmental policy.</p> 
<p>Yandle was the subject of a recent interview on environmental economics in 
the<em>Region Focus</em> magazine by the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, part of 
which appears below. For more PERC Q&amp;As, see theQ&amp;A archives.</p> 
<p><strong>RF: How did you become interested in the economics of the 
environment?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Yandle:</strong>&nbsp;What some people refer to as the 
&ldquo;externality revolution&rdquo; was occurring in economics when I was a 
doctoral student in the late 1960s. In addition to that, there was the 
revolution that was formed by the rise of public choice as an analytical 
device, primarily associated with Gordon Tullock and James Buchanan&rsquo;s 
1962 book,&nbsp;<em>The Calculus of Consent</em>. Both were associated with a 
move from normative to positive economics and empirically-based studies. I 
wrote my dissertation on externalities in housing and the rise of what were 
then called slums and the programs that were addressing them, urban renewal. So 
I began writing on property rights and external effects, and that led naturally 
into questions of water quality, air quality, pollution, and so forth.</p> 
<p>My direct link into questions of the environment as we think of it narrowly 
&ndash;water, air &mdash; was a colleague I became associated with at Clemson 
by the name of Hugh Macaulay. He was writing on, as he put it, &ldquo;dirty 
water.&rdquo; So when I joined that faculty, there was a senior faculty member 
who was working on this. I thought, my work transfers directly. I just have to 
change the names on the axes from &ldquo;housing&rdquo; to &ldquo;water,&rdquo; 
then I&rsquo;ve got my model.</p> 
<p><strong>RF: In your writings about environmental economics, you&rsquo;ve 
described a &ldquo;systems approach&rdquo; and a &ldquo;process approach&rdquo; 
to environmental policy issues. What do you mean by these terms?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Yandle:</strong>&nbsp;A systems approach is where the 
&ldquo;brightest and best&rdquo; get together and look at a problem and come up 
with what they believe to be the best solution. They describe the system that 
can be installed that will lead to a solution of the problem and so it tends to 
be top-down.</p> 
<p>In a process approach, you identify goals and outcomes, develop some rules 
of the game, and then let the process take hold, holding accountability with 
respect to outcome. You don&rsquo;t tell people how to do things; you say this 
is the outcome that must be achieved, or it&rsquo;s going to be costly for you.
</p> 
<p><strong>RF: You have been a proponent of the process approach. But 
aren&rsquo;t there success stories that the systems approach has enjoyed?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Yandle:</strong>&nbsp;There are success stories in both camps. The 
process approach is by far the oldest because common law is a process approach 
where there are rules of property, rules of liability, rules with respect to 
pollution that have been around for centuries, so that one cannot impose costs 
on his neighbor without your neighbor&rsquo;s permission, or your neighbor has 
a cause of action against you. At common law, people downstream hold property 
rights to water quality and people upstream cannot destroy that with impunity. 
Basically what protected air and water quality in the United States up until 
the late 1960s was the process approach based on common law, with a lot of 
state and local ordinances and statutes supplementing it. So there are 
wonderful success stories there. That is, somehow we all survived until the 
1970s without having a systems approach imposed from the top for the 
environment in a consistent way.</p> 
<p>There are transaction-cost problems and enforcement-cost problems that lead 
to situations where people will understandably develop a systems approach. 
Generally, when you have crises, systems approaches tend to take over &mdash; 
that is, we move to hierarchies, just as we are seeing now with Japan and 
nuclear power.</p> 
<p>There are some wonderful success stories: EPA is now promoting process with 
respect to river basin management approaches for water quality and we&rsquo;ve 
got some pretty interesting success stories going on there. They are, I would 
say, hampered inasmuch as they are promoting it within the context of 
technology-based, systems-approach standards based on inputs, and that&rsquo;s 
because of the statutes under which they operate. The statute says you will 
define &ldquo;best available control technology&rdquo; and require it of all 
users of these particular streams. We have gotten to the point now where the 
EPA is identifying maximum loads that can be imposed on a stream; that&rsquo;s 
an outcome. Then EPA says, OK, members of this watershed community, tell us how 
you would like to achieve that goal. That&rsquo;s a process.</p> 
<p><strong>RF: You mentioned transaction costs. How much of an obstacle are 
transaction costs to environmental protection under the process approach?
