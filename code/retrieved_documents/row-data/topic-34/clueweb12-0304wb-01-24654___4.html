<h2>Fake vs real Christmas trees</h2> 
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s Christmas time again and so begins the real versus fake 
Christmas tree debate. But which is the most sustainable option?</p> 
<p>Many environmentalists would agree that real trees are the better choice, 
at least from a personal and public health standpoint. Others believe a case 
can be made for fake trees, because they are re-used every year and thus 
don&rsquo;t generate the waste of their real counterparts. Whichever you 
prefer, here are a few facts to consider:</p> 
<p><strong>Fake Christmas trees</strong><br>
Fake trees are a convenient and 
long-lasting option, however there are manufacturing processes, materials and 
possible health ramifications to consider.&nbsp; Fake trees are made with 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is a non-renewable, petroleum-derived plastic 
that generates several known carcinogens during its production.</p> 
<p>If you do choose a fake tree, follow the instructions carefully to ensure 
that it lasts for years to come. You should also be sure to heed the advice on 
the label, which warns against inhaling or eating any dust or parts that may 
come loose. This is especially important if you&rsquo;re sharing Christmas Day 
with some little people. And we don&rsquo;t mean elves.</p> 
<p><strong>Real Christmas trees</strong><br>
Unfortunately the more 
traditional option also has a few downsides. Primarily Christmas trees are 
farmed as agricultural products, and as such often require repeated 
applications of pesticides over their typical eight-year lifecycles, which 
means they may contribute to pollution of local watersheds.</p> 
<p>This is true not only while the trees are growing, but once the dust from 
the holiday season has settled, Christmas party planners who opt for a real 
tree must also consider its disposal carefully. Fortunately there are many 
facilities, such as the McRobies Gully Waste Management Centre in South Hobart, 
which provide a place for you to dispose of greenwaste and will mulch and 
compost your real Christmas tree &ndash; easy done.</p> 
<p>If you feel you can take measures to adequately dispose of your real tree, 
then nothing beats the adventure of driving out to select your own unique tree 
rather than a mass-produced plastic one &ndash; a tradition among many families 
at this time of year. Just be sure to select your tree from a tree farm or from 
entrepreneurial folks are selling real trees privately &ndash; trespassing on 
private property doesn&rsquo;t fit with the Christmas spirit.</p> 
<p>But by far the most eco-friendly way to enjoy a Christmas tree is to buy a 
live tree with its roots intact from a local grower, and then replant it in 
your yard once the holiday has passed.&nbsp; Whichever option you take, it is 
important to make sure that the tree is extravagantly decorated and presents 
are piled up underneath it.</p>
