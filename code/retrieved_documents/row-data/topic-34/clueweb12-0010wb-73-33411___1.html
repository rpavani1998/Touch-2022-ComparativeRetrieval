Real vs. fake Christmas trees ... what's better 
for the environment?
<p></p> 
<p> What's worse for the environment? </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>  Is buying a new Christmas tree every year the way to go or is purchasing 
a not-quite-as-charming-but-reusable faux evergreen an eco thumbs up? I figured 
environmentalists would root for fake but according to<i>EarthTalk</i>: </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> &quot;... most environmentalists, &quot;tree huggers&quot; among them, 
would agree that real trees are the better choice, at least from a personal and 
public health standpoint. Some might make a case for fake trees, because they 
are re-used every year and thus don't generate the waste of their real 
counterparts. But fake trees are made with polyvinyl chloride (or PVC, 
otherwise known as vinyl), one of the most environmentally offensive forms of 
non-renewable, petroleum-derived plastic.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Either way, I'm not thrilled with either option, even though the city of 
Montreal makes good use of discarded Christmas trees. So last year I bought a 
living Christmas tree.</p> 
<p> And it lived. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> For a month. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Notwithstanding that my lovely little evergreen came with zero 
instructions -- the florist didn't known what species it was either -- I 
suspect the problem was that it needed to go outside. My colleague Steve Nix, 
About.com's guide to Forestry saysseven to ten days is an acceptable time lapse 
to keep a living Christmas tree indoors before putting it outside for eventual 
planting. He adds that some experts recommend shortening that to four days.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> Above: your humble guide's living Christmas tree didn't make it past 
one month. Strike 1: it was not a conifer suitable for indoor houseplant life. 
Strike 2: as a living Christmas tree that was supposed to be planted outdoors, 
it should have never been fertilized -- which I did, unwittingly -- because 
that risks provoking new growth, awakening the dormant tree, which means it 
likely won't survive when the time comes to plant it outdoors. Strike 3: it was 
left indoors much longer than the ten-day cutoff point.<i>Photo &copy; Evelyn 
Reid</i> 
<p> But what about apartment dwellers and home owners with limited yard space? 
Is there a living Christmas tree that can stay inside year round?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> Above: a Norfolk pine, one of the only conifers able to survive as a 
year-round indoor plant.<i>Photo by Flickr user Rosa Say</i> 
<p> Yes, there is one conifer that can withstand the rigors of indoor life: 
the Norfolk pine, a subtropical evergreen fromNorfolk Island which would 
quickly expire if you<i>did</i> put it outside. At least in Canada. And 
according to extension greenhouse and nursery crops specialist Dr. Leonard 
Perry, you don't need much of a green thumb to handle the cone-bearing Norfolk:
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> &quot;If you want to invest in a houseplant with a future, buy a Norfolk 
Island pine. It requires minimal care, and because it grows slowly will remain 
small and attractive for many years indoors.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Among the Norfolk pine's main downsides as a holiday centerpiece is it's 
tricky to find one as large as a traditional cut tree, its branches are not as 
numerous nor dense and it's sensitive to pressure, generally unable to handle 
too many decorations. Even if it can bear the weight, the branches might droop 
permanently from the overload. And Christmas lights dry out the Norfolk pine 
quickly, making it require daily misting and moisture checks.</p>
