Your Own</b> <br>
 An annual point of contention, what's the better 
environmental choice? A real Christmas tree that lasts for a few weeks or a 
fake one that can be reused for years?You might be surprised by what 
environmentalists have to say. And it's hard to argue with the visual aesthetic 
and aroma permeating a home adorned with a freshly cut Christmas conifer, 
particularly one picked by you and yours.
<p></p>
