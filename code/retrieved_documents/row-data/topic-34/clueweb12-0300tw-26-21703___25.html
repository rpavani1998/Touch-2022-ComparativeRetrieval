<h2>Northwest Flower and Garden Show Is A Gardener&rsquo;s Ultimate&nbsp;Gig!
</h2> 16 Feb 
<p>Last weekend I visited the Northwest Flower and Garden Show and it was a 
trip to a Gardeners&rsquo; promise land! &nbsp;Stocked to the max with 
superlative seminars, overflowing with fantastic display gardens and awash with 
wondrous plants, garden art, containers, decor, bulbs, etc&hellip;.made me 
think&hellip;&rdquo;Why did I fly here? &nbsp;Really&hellip;the airline only 
lets you bring<strong> two</strong> carry-ons!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You get the idea, right? &nbsp;Anything&nbsp;a gardener would imagine or 
want could be found here. &nbsp;And with so much garden speak and garden 
variety brimming about it was more than a little hard to be disciplined.</p> 
<h5><strong>New Info:</strong></h5> 
<p>I managed to stay quite focused and calm during the seminars and my 
favorite ones were Joe Lamp&rsquo;l's &ldquo;Growing a Greener World &ndash; 
Gardening to Make a Difference,&rdquo; &nbsp;and Graham Kerr&rsquo;s (formerly 
known as the &lsquo;Galloping Gourmet&rsquo;) &ldquo;Eat. Grow. Gather. Share. 
(E.G.G.S.).&rdquo; &nbsp;Both of these talks were entertaining and more 
importantly focused on amazing people and projects currently underway helping 
people across America to get growing some of their own food. &nbsp;Whether it 
be to improve personal health, build a sense of community amongst neighbors, be 
more resource-efficient and earth-friendly or to help feed those that are 
hungry, it is amazing how growing food can have a positive impact! &nbsp;To 
learn more about Joe Lamp&rsquo;l's work go towww.growingagreenerworld.com
&nbsp;and to consider becoming a part of Graham Kerr&rsquo;s proposed food 
initiative got toeggscartonclub.com.</p> 
<p>Another favorite was Colin McCrate&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Peak of 
Perfection&rdquo; which put forth a key concept that can help any edible garden 
grower. &nbsp;The message, &ldquo;every plant&rsquo;s single goal is to flower 
so it can reproduce and spread itself.&rdquo; &nbsp;As elementary as that 
sounds, it plays a key role in knowing when to harvest edibles.&nbsp;The 
realization that edible crops have a harvest window based on the rate of their 
growth and that these plants find a way to get to the flowering stage no matter 
what, helps understand when it is time to harvest.</p> 
<p>For example, a short season, fast-growing crop such as lettuce has a short 
window of prime harvesting. Furthermore even the &lsquo;cut and come 
again&rsquo; varieties will burn themselves out after two cycles and begin to 
just throw up flower stalks instead of continuing to produce leaves. &nbsp;I 
found this helpful because oftentimes I find myself distracted with other 
things during what is most likely the prime harvest window of some crops 
because I&rsquo;m thinking they can &ldquo;keep&rdquo; awhile longer since they 
are still in the ground/growing. &nbsp;To read more of Colin McCrate&rsquo;s 
work check out&nbsp;www.seattleurbanfarmco.com</p> 
<h5>Exquisite Displays:</h5> 
<p>After many good seminars on Friday, Saturday was left to enjoy a leisurely 
cadence exploring the display gardens and finding some &ldquo;garden 
must-haves&rdquo;. &nbsp;The display gardens were exceedingly creative 
embracing this year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;A Floral Symphony,&rdquo; in many 
different ways ranging from incorporating musical instruments such as pianos 
and harps to including subtle sounds found only in nature.</p> 
<p>The People&rsquo;s Choice Award was awarded to Sublime Garden Design for 
their holistic garden &ldquo;Resonating Sounds of Nature ~ Finding Peace and 
Solace in the Garden.&rdquo; &nbsp;A favorite as soon as I saw it! &nbsp;I love 
how they used classic design principles&nbsp;and embraced natural sound in the 
garden via water droplets rhythmically falling on drums. &nbsp;Think how 
relaxing it would be to sit in this garden on a rainy day when you can&rsquo;t 
be out working in the dirt anyway!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here are a couple of photos of other display gardens that offered unique 
beats&hellip;</p> 
<p>The &quot;green&quot; or floral wall displays were all the rage...this one 
made form a wood pallet I believe</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The fine seating areas in the display gardens are always a draw for me. 
&nbsp;They are so inviting and offer different ways to relax in your garden. 
&nbsp;Here are a few pics of ones that struck a chord with me.</p> 
<p>Love the &quot;raised&quot; seating with fragrant blooms underneath...</p> 
<h5></h5> 
<p>ground-level, &quot;comfy&quot; seating</p> 
<p>Many gardens featured panels for privacy, structure and ambience</p> 
<h5></h5> 
<h5></h5> 
<h5>Garden Must-Haves</h5> 
<p>After picking up some lily bulbs and black-foliage Dahlia tubers, (items 
easily packed in my suitcase) I found myself in the steady rhythm of a 
full-blown shopping spree. &nbsp;I had no one to help me resist temptations. My 
friend that was with me shares a passion for beautiful plants and garden art 
and was picking up things at a tempo faster than the song&ldquo;Walking on 
Sunshine&ldquo;. &nbsp;This was <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;helpful&hellip;plus, 
she &nbsp;had a car to put everything in&hellip;(a little garden envy here )</p>
<p>We walked the isles &lsquo;oohing&rsquo; and &lsquo;ahhing&rsquo; over some 
fantastic items:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Love this table!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The shopping craze reached its crescendo when I was in a discussion about a 
very cool solar green house (retailing for a couple of thousand dollars) and 
whether I should order one since two others were being delivered to the Boise 
area next month. &nbsp;<strong>I needed it</strong>! &nbsp;And if they were 
already bringing some to my area&hellip;</p> 
<p>Thankfully, there was a <em><strong>&lsquo;ritardando&rsquo;</strong></em> 
written into my shopping symphony and it arrived just in time to keep me from 
going through with that purchase! &nbsp;I ended my spree on a pleasant note 
settling on an amazing wicker basket for harvest gathering. &nbsp;Of course, it 
was too big for the plane so my friend is keeping it for me until the next time 
I get to Portland.</p> 
<p>The NWFG show was a true hit! If you&rsquo;ve not taken in a garden show 
for a few years or perhaps ever, I highly recommend it. &nbsp;Lots of 
opportunities to learn about new ideas combined with creative, positive people 
makes for a great gig!</p> 
<p>My friend showing no restraint and just plain 'giddiness' over her new 
garden must-have! </p>

<h2>Orchid&nbsp;Amore</h2> 10 Feb 
<p>I was lucky enough to be the receiver of some Orchid amore today! &nbsp;In 
fact not just a single dose, but a double dose! &nbsp;These two beauties opened 
their first blossom on the same day.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write a post on Orchids but have not gotten 
around to it just yet. But as Valentine&rsquo;s Day approaches it seems like 
Orchid-mania has kicked in once again. &nbsp;Just go to any garden store, 
nursery or even grocery/big box stores and see the beautiful spikes l0aded with 
intricately designed blooms. &nbsp;I like to think of them as pulling me 
through the last few cold weeks of winter with their amazing blooms promising 
that Spring will arrive soon.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m off to see many gorgeous specimens at the Northwest 
Flower and Garden Show in Seattle. &nbsp;But look for a post next week on 
general Orchid care for the types most commonly available.</p> 
<p>So if Cupid&rsquo;s arrow delivers some Orchid amore to you this week, fear 
not and look forward to enjoying their beauty for years to come.</p> 
<p><em>Do you already enjoy growing orchids? &nbsp;Have you ever decided 
against purchasing an orchid due to the fear of not being able to get it to 
rebloom? &nbsp;Share your Orchid tales here&hellip;</em></p>

<h2>My February Edible&nbsp;Garden</h2> 6 Feb 
<p>February is here and I&rsquo;m getting excited as my seeds arrive, the 2012 
growing season is about to begin. &nbsp;Fresh &lsquo;green goods&rsquo; from my 
garden no longer seem like a pipe dream as I look out onto the bland back yard.
I&rsquo;m imagining how wonderful they will look and taste in just a another 
couple of months. &nbsp;But something strikes through this imaginative state 
and I think about my edible garden from last year that is in the freezer? 
&nbsp;With a new growing season on the horizon have I forgotten about some 
fresh, admittedly frozen, &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; from last year&rsquo;s garden?
</p> 
<p>I spent valuable time in-doors last season carefully preparing and freezing 
various items. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t let myself &nbsp;forget about them even 
though I&rsquo;m currently focused on going to grocers that offer high-quality 
fruits and vegetables so that we can continue eating fresh during the winter.
</p> 
<p>However, the whole purpose of preserving the harvest is to enjoy it once 
production has stopped, so last week I decided to break my current routine. 
&nbsp;I looked in the freezer<em><strong>before</strong></em> I went to the 
grocer. &nbsp;I made food from my<strong><em>February edible garden</em>
</strong>!</p> 
<p>To start, blueberries. &nbsp;Remember the 50 lbs of blueberries I picked in 
the Pacific Northwestlast summer?&nbsp;Little bags of frozen berries were 
stuffed everywhere in our freezer. &nbsp;You may be surprised to hear that only 
4 bags are left! &nbsp;No, I have not gone wild adding a bit of blueberry to 
every dish no matter what it is.</p> 
<p>Instead, my daughters (also sometimes referred to as &lsquo;garden 
mates&rsquo; ) have developed a wonderful habit of eating a bowlful of frozen 
blueberries each night before they go to bed. &nbsp;It is so routine for them 
that they don&rsquo;t even ask about dessert anymore, they just know 
they&rsquo;ll get blueberries if they eat a good dinner. &nbsp;Now this is not 
to say that if I offer something different they wouldn&rsquo;t snatch it up in 
a heartbeat with their little sweet-tooths. But they are completely content 
having a snack of blueberries as their dessert. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>How did this happen? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t actually know&hellip;maybe 
it&rsquo;s one of the&nbsp;positives that can happen from taking your children 
u-picking and forging a real connection about where their food comes from along 
with its beauty and taste&hellip;</p> 
<p><em><strong>Back to my February edibles</strong></em>&hellip;with only a 
moderate amount of blueberries left I decided to try one new recipe that would 
be healthy in nature and offer my family something beyond &ldquo;blueberries 
straight-up!&rdquo; &nbsp;I chose &lsquo;Best Blueberry Muffins&rsquo; from 
Eighty-Twenty, a food blog that I like. &nbsp;These were easy to make and quite 
a good little &lsquo;starter&rsquo; in the mornings as they include rolled 
oats, yogurt, blueberries, etc&hellip; with just a modest amount of sugar. 
&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s therecipe if you want to try it.</p> 
<p>Through the process of looking around in the freezer I found some packages 
of my homemade spaghetti sauce. You may be thinking, &ldquo;o.k., some tomatoes 
from the garden&rdquo;&hellip;but there are onions, carrots and lots of herbs 
in it as well. &nbsp;So really, lots of fresh produce straight from the garden, 
with a stop in the freezer, to the table.</p> 
<p>Spaghetti is always easy but having the homemade sauce with deliciousness 
from the garden and a different flavor than store-bought sauces makes it seem 
special.</p> 
<p>And my third choice for the week was a sour-cherry pistachio crisp. 
&nbsp;Again, while searching the freezer I found several containers of 
wonderful sour-cherries that I picked from my mom and grandma&rsquo;s trees. 
&nbsp;I looked for some recipes with a healthy bent and came up with this one 
fromMartha Stewart. &nbsp;I was intrigued with combining these intricately 
flavored cherries with pistachios, a favorite nut around our house. 
&nbsp;Interested?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The crisp was a hit with my family ! &nbsp;Lots of cherry flavor combined 
with an earthy-nuttiness, just enough sweet and easy to make!</p> 
<p>So I made a dent in my February edible garden and still have some 
&lsquo;garden goodness&rsquo; to pull out. &nbsp;<strong><em>How about you? 
&nbsp;Do you spend time preserving your harvest and then find yourself 
forgetting to eat it during the winter months?</em></strong></p> 
<p>If so, hopefully this will be a reminder to go to your freezer or pantry to 
find your February edible garden!</p>

<h2>Seedy&nbsp;Ideas&hellip;.</h2> 30 Jan 
<p>It&rsquo;s time. Time to start the forward motion for a gorgeous and 
productive garden in 2012. First up, is selecting seeds. I&rsquo;ve been 
browsing the offerings from my favorite suppliers as well as some 
&lsquo;new-to-me&rsquo; suppliers to determine my projects for this year.</p> 
<p>One of my new veggie choices for this year is beets. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never 
done much with them but I have become more interested since learning about all 
they have to offer. &nbsp;For example, you can not only eat the beets but also 
the beet &lsquo;greens&rsquo; a.k.a. young foliage. &nbsp;Also, I have come 
across more and more simple recipes (TODAY FOOD, &nbsp;WELL-NY Times Blog, 
Eighty Twenty ) that include beets and this is probably because they are known 
to contain antioxidants<em>and</em> anti-inflamtory and detoxification support. 
Since they are full of fiber, magnesium and potassium not to mention 
beta-carotene, calcium and iron and are easy to prepare there is a lot to like 
about beets!</p> 
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds&nbsp;for my beet seeds 
(&lsquo;Bulls Blood&rsquo; and &lsquo;Golden&rsquo;). &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never 
purchased from them before but they have an excellent reputation (only selling 
non-GMO seeds), very reasonable prices and the largest selection of heirloom 
seeds available in the U.S. &nbsp;They recently put out a book titled, &lsquo;
<em>The Heirloom Life Garde</em><em>ner&rsquo;</em> that I first heard about on 
NPR&rsquo;s Morning Edition this fall. &nbsp;The book looks to be quite a 
resource for learning about gardening with heirloom varieties. &nbsp;Have you 
heard of it?</p> 
<p>Another new-to-me supplier with very reasonable prices is The&nbsp;Fragrant 
Path from Nebraska. &nbsp;This company focuses primarily on fragrant plants, as 
the name reveals and has a nice selection of annuals, perennials, grasses and 
herbs. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m ordering<em>Datura metel</em> or<em> Angel&rsquo;s 
Trumpet&nbsp;</em>as an ornamental for my back patio.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are just too many temptations from a company like 
Johnny&rsquo;s Selected Seeds to <strong><em>not</em></strong> place an order. 
&nbsp;Besides, I&rsquo;ve been able to germinate seeds from Johnny&rsquo;s that 
were many years old and had not been stored properly so I think they have 
quality seeds. &nbsp;You can always count on Johnny&rsquo;s to find something 
you like and for me this year, it&rsquo;s arugula, kale, lettuces, Gold Rave 
tomato, Baby Bear pumpkins and Buttercream and Chocolate sunflowers. 
&nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t that sound fun?!</p> 
<p>Seeds of Change, Rene&rsquo;s&nbsp;Gardens,&nbsp;Territorial Seed Co., and 
Botanical Interests are other wonderful seed companies that I always purchase a 
packet or two from. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got a few things from them already but 
have not finished my selections just yet. &nbsp;In other words, I have to 
garner up some self-discipline and make sure my seedy ideas are not out of 
control before I place my order.</p> 
<p>I had gotten away from growing with seed but went back to it last year and 
although it is inexpensive, gives you more control over what you grow and is 
very rewarding, those little guys can be time-consuming when it comes time to 
pot up, harden off and plant out. &nbsp;So good to remember the old saying, 
your eyes can be bigger than&hellip;your available garden time!</p> 
<p><strong><em>How about you? &nbsp;Who are some of your favorite seed 
suppliers? &nbsp;Are you growing a new vegetable or fruit this year? &nbsp;Do 
you have a special flower you are trying from seed? Are you planning to grow 
more with heirloom and organic seeds this year?</em></strong></p>

<h2>First Snow Inspires A Winter&nbsp;Haiku</h2> 18 Jan 
<h2></h2> 
<pre><strong><em>First winter snow falls</em></strong> <strong><em>Dry trees 
breathe deeply with smile</em></strong> <strong><em>A joyous trip to Seattle is 
my tea</em></strong></pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>A little winter Haiku for me today after awaking to the first snowfall in 
the Boise area. &nbsp;And yes, the trees and other plants in the garden are 
happy today because it has been such a dry winter.</p> 
<p>When temps are below freezing every night and the air is very dry with 
little moisture<em>anywhere</em>, it is really tough on tree/plant health. 
&nbsp;So much so, that just last week one of the local nurseries,Franz Witte, 
put out a notice letting customers know they should start winter watering all 
evergreens and deciduous plants that were recently planted (1-2 years).</p> 
<p>Thankfully Mother Nature has taken care of this&nbsp;<em>before</em> I had 
to go out and find a hose and sprinkler, get a faucet turned on, water and then 
drain the hose before the temps fell back to freezing. Whew, thanks again 
Mother N!</p> 
<p><strong>Maybe you are wondering about the last line of my Haiku..</strong>
.it is in reference to my upcoming getaway to the<em>Northwest Flower and 
Garden Show</em> in Seattle during February. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so excited to go 
to this show again! &nbsp;The display gardens and seminars are fantastic and 
there is a plethora of new ideas and information to absorb.</p> 
<p>This show is a great place to spend time with gardening friends, learn from 
the pros and buy some fantastic plants! &nbsp;The only downside is that this 
weekend full of Spring makes it hard to come back to Zone 6 and eight more 
weeks of winter weather!</p> 
<p>If interested in attending check out the website where you will find 
descriptions of display gardens, a seminar schedule, travel packages and more.
</p> 
<p>Drop me a line if you decide to attend, maybe we&rsquo;ll run onto each 
when rushing for a new, &lsquo;must-have&rsquo; garden delight!</p>

<h2>Reflecting and Resting&hellip;A Welcome Quiet&nbsp;Period</h2> 12 Jan 
<p></p> 
<p>This is the time of year I am most reflective. &nbsp;When people ask over 
the New Year Holidays about my resolutions I answer by saying, &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t know yet, I&rsquo;ll figure them out in January.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Throughout this month I like to reflect on the events and experiences of 
the previous year while thinking forward about changes to cultivate and 
experiences to be had in the new year.&nbsp;Thinking forward to the new year in 
a reflective state of mind might sound contradictory&nbsp;but somehow 
it&rsquo;s oddly satisfying.</p> 
<p>And I&rsquo;m resting&hellip;sort of&hellip; (<em>although I am still 
bumping-up the workouts to bump-off the extra bumps resulting from the holidays
</em>)</p> 
<p>But seriously, the shorter days with less light put me in a restful mood. 
&nbsp;I am&nbsp;resting because of all the fun social celebrations that took 
place,&nbsp;because this is the month with the least garden activities and 
because I feel a need to gather soulful, creative energy. &nbsp;As I quietly 
think of all the activities I get to engage in during the coming months there 
is a realization that now is the time to take deep breaths and focus on my 
well-being as a whole.</p> 
<p>For gardening in particular, the new year means a new growing season and 
for garden-crazies like me a new-found sense of excitement and hope.&nbsp;I 
find myself looking through photos of the natural world from trips we&rsquo;ve 
taken the previous year and thinking about how I can incorporate some elements 
of the natural world&rsquo;s beauty into my controlled, man-made 
environment.&nbsp;I love to take photos of the places we visit and use them as 
potential inspiration&hellip;the colors, textures, forms&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So with a cup of hot tea, some books and some photos it&rsquo;s a good time 
to do as the old adage says -&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Stop and smell the 
roses.&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m thinking for me it means the 
roses of life and the year to come&hellip; since it is still January you know!
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>How about you? &nbsp;How do you feel at the beginning of the new year? 
&nbsp;Does January bring any changes to your behavior or lifestyle? &nbsp;If 
living in a cold zone, how do you get your gardening fix or keep your gardening 
fascination?</em></p>

<h2>Are You &ldquo;Fir&rdquo; Real or &ldquo;Faux&rdquo;&nbsp;Fake?</h2> 11 Dec
<p>To those that celebrate Christmas, do you still whole-heartedly stand by a 
&ldquo;real&rdquo; Christmas tree, say a Doug, Grand, Frazier or Noble fir? 
&nbsp;Or, are you in the camp that faux is where it&rsquo;s at &ndash; fake it 
baby, just don&rsquo;t break it! Or, maybe you are really hard-core &ndash; 
part of the &lsquo;live tree party movement&rsquo; &ndash; that goes potted and 
takes it all the way by finding a permanent outdoor home?</p> 
<p>Yes, I am a gardener and therefore have the tendency to think fresh is 
always best. &nbsp;But even if I wasn&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t see putting up a 
faux tree. For me, the essence of the whole tradition is bringing an awesome 
organism from the natural world to your indoor environment to connect to the 
world at large and ancient times. (I know this is not the historic legend 
behind the Christmas tree but it is what it means to me.) Some type of tree 
grows most everywhere around the world and they have been around since 
pre-historic times so I feel they connect us to the earth and to time gone by 
thousands of years ago.</p> 
<p>Too philosophical, o.k. a simpler take &ndash; the genuine smell of a real 
Christmas tree cannot be replaced with artificial air fresheners or potpourri. 
&nbsp;And what about the fun of taking a natural, imperfect anatomy and turning 
it into a head-turning beaut of a tree. You know, the &lsquo;Charlie 
Brown&rsquo; factor of a having a real Christmas tree.</p> 
<p>Note the hole in the upper left side...</p> 
<p>I will admit to having had thoughts of getting a make-believe tree in 
recent years. &nbsp;They have become more appealing &ndash; &nbsp;especially 
when many of my friends have their plastic wann-a-bee-trees up by December 1 
and are on to other parts of the busy Holiday season while say on Dec. 10th, 
&nbsp;I&rsquo;m still considering where we are going to get our real tree.</p> 
<p>I <strong>KNOW</strong>there is quite an upside to these counterfeit 
creations like&hellip;</p> 
<p>Fake $350 Costco tree looking pretty perfect</p> 
<ul> 
<li>-easier to put up, no hassle with selection, getting it your home, 
re-cutting the bottom to fit in the tree stand, etc&hellip;</li> 
<li>-can be put up early, &nbsp;no need to worry about needle fall, dry-out, 
or fire hazards</li> 
<li>- all branches are equal-in terms of strength and length, no strategizing 
necessary of where and how to place ornaments</li> 
<li>-cost effective (for sure)</li> 
<li>-<strong> good for environment</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>Uh oh&hellip;<strong>good for the environment?</strong> &nbsp;This is where 
I see a faux tree as more fraudulent than ever&hellip;</p> 
<p>Who actually believes a faux tree is better for the environment than a real 
tree? &nbsp;I have thought about this quite a lot and I just don&rsquo;t see 
how someone can place this &ldquo;spin&rdquo; on a faux tree.</p> 
<p>Considered fairly, an artificial tree is made one time so one batch of 
chemicals and one batch of by-product. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s then shipped thousands 
of miles (mostly likely by boat) across an ocean, then trucked to&nbsp;a retail 
outlet, purchased and then used (hopefully) at least 10-15 years (maybe more). 
&nbsp;So, it can seem like a reasonably &ldquo;green&rdquo; purchase, but then 
its ultimate destination is the landfill where it lies for another million or 
trillion years putting out toxic fumes and taking up space.</p> 
<p>To the best of my knowledge fake Christmas trees are not made out of 
recyclable plastic so there is no repurposing.</p> 
<p>Now look at the difference when comparing a real Christmas tree. 
&nbsp;Sure, farmed Christmas trees consume some resources while 
growing&hellip;water for one. However, most Christmas tree farms are located in 
areas like the Pacific Northwest, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan 
where there is ample natural moisture. In other words, not a lot of irrigation 
required.</p> 
<p>Yes, real Christmas trees may be sprayed with pesticides but don&rsquo;t 
forget artificial trees put out toxic fumes from the plastic production. 
&nbsp;And yes, real trees are trucked all over the country each year and these 
factors give them some undeniable marks in the &lsquo;environmental 
unfriendliness&rsquo; column.</p> 
<h3><strong>BUT, consider this&hellip;</strong></h3> 
<p>prior to harvest farmed Christmas trees are a&nbsp;carbon sink, harnessing 
bad greenhouse gasses while producing oxygen at the same time. They are 
continually replenished with&nbsp;two or three seedlings for every one tree 
that is harvested for the holiday. &nbsp;In addition, American Christmas tree 
farms provide over 500,000 acres of wild life habitat and green space. 
&nbsp;Did you notice some key words&hellip;American farms&hellip;real Christmas 
trees are actually &ldquo;made&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; here in 
America.</p> 
<p>Courtesy of one of my local garden centers - Zamzows</p> 
<p>And the topper, making them hands down the most environmentally friendly 
choice, their final resting place is right where they started &ndash; the 
earth. &nbsp;They are 100% biodegradable, recyclable. &nbsp;When composted, 
they actually even improve the earth adding nutrients back into the soil!</p> 
<h3>So keep it <strong>&ldquo;FIR&rdquo;</strong> real people! &nbsp;(Or 
Spruce or Pine) Stand strong by a real (fresh from the farm, live or forest 
permitted) Christmas tree.</h3> 
<p>(That&rsquo;s once you get it and have it in the house.  )</p> 
<p>And Voila...you see? A real beaut...</p>

<h2>A Simple Thanks Will&nbsp;Do</h2> 24 Nov 
<p>As the years go by I appreciate the subtleness of Thanksgiving more and 
more. &nbsp;Yes, in many ways it is a holiday that is being eclipsed by 
Christmas and other Fall/Winter celebrations but maybe it&rsquo;s all a matter 
of perspective.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful &ndash; &nbsp;Thanksgiving is simple. &nbsp;The activity 
around it is grounded in using seasonable food to share a special meal with 
loved ones. &nbsp;What is more essential and represents human celebration and 
tradition more than that? &nbsp;The intellectual component is just as 
authentic. &nbsp;Making time to give thought and thanks to the elements (human 
and otherwise) in one&rsquo;s life that contribute to well-being and happiness.
</p> 
<p>Recently, I heard a well-known, wildly successful, public spokes-lady make 
a comment about, &ldquo;trying to save Thanksgiving.&rdquo; &nbsp;My thought 
was, &ldquo;hopefully not with a lot of trimmings, trinkets and extra 
traditions that lead to commercialism with a capital C and blow away the easy 
beauty and richness of simple celebrations.</p> 
<p><strong>Keep perspective, keep Thanksgiving simple. &nbsp;</strong>We 
Americans need some simplicity in our lives to keep us grounded, right?</p> 
<p>In keeping with simple gratitude I&rsquo;m thankful to be a daily gardener 
possessing a special keenness towards the natural world. By keenness, I 
don&rsquo;t mean a special talent, skill or understanding. &nbsp;I just mean a 
connection that makes me feel incredibly motivated, inspired, hopeful, 
incredulous and sometimes even fearful (certain creatures, you know&hellip; ).
</p> 
<p>To express my gratitude of the natural world, I&rsquo;m sharing some shots 
of the places and moments I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to experience over the 
years. &nbsp;Some from years ago and others recent but all in my memory and 
thankful thoughts. &nbsp;Thankful to have witnessed such genuine beauty&hellip;
</p> 
<p>And, I simply can&rsquo;t sign out today without expressing thanks to my 
loving family and friends. &nbsp;Thank you all for being in my life. 
&nbsp;Everyone enjoy a&nbsp;Simple Day of Giving Thanks!</p>

<h2>Last out of the Garden, First in the&nbsp;Garden</h2> 15 Nov 
<p>November has brought a swift wrap-up to much of the garden. &nbsp;The cold 
temperatures made sure all lingering warm-season edibles have bit&nbsp;the dust 
and the few cool-season edibles are no longer showing much growth. 
Additionally, the ornamental garden has reached its peak color and is now 
fading to muted form and color and will soon give way to the all engulfing cold 
of Winter.</p> 
<h2>Last Out<em> -</em></h2> 
<p>The swift changes mean many tasks for the head gardener, me! &nbsp;But last 
week, during one of the rainy-windy afternoons, I decided to prolong my garden 
shut-down &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; a bit longer and use &nbsp;the last of my San 
Marzano tomatoes that have been ripening in the window sill over the last 
couple of weeks.&nbsp;I made my last batch of marinara sauce with them and used 
my friend Shauney&rsquo;s recipe that has turned into my favorite of the 
homemade marinara&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve tried this year.</p> 
<p>My San Marzano tomato was very prolific this year and of course there were 
many, many tomatoes yet to ripen when the frosty night-time lows hit. &nbsp;I 
brought many inside, ripened them in a South facing window and into the 
marinara sauce they went. &nbsp;In case you are still harvesting or ripening 
tomatoes inside and are interested in a marinara the recipe is below.</p> 
<p>It is quite simple and I really prefer its flavor over other recipes that 
call for red wine, sausage/bacon fat or other ingredients that are supposed to 
add extra flavor.</p> 
<p>A Friendly Marinara</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1/2&nbsp;c. extra virgin olive oil</p> 
<p>2 small onions, finely chopped</p> 
<p>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p> 
<p>2 celery stalks, finely chopped</p> 
<p>2 carrots peeled and finely chopped</p> 
<p>1 &ndash; 2 tablespoons fresh thyme</p> 
<p>1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp pepper</p> 
<p>32oz fresh tomatoes chopped -&nbsp; I use San Marzanos</p> 
<p>2 dried bay leaves</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In large pot, heat oil over medium heat.&nbsp; Add onions and garlic and 
saute&rsquo; until the onions are translucent, about 10 min. Add celery, 
carrots, thyme, salt and pepper. Saute&rsquo; another&nbsp;10 min.&nbsp; Add 
tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered over low heat for about an hour. 
Remove bay leaves and season with salt and pepper to taste. Once cooled I 
pur&eacute;e via the food processor. &nbsp;Of course you can skip this step if 
you like a chunkier marinara.</p> 
<h1><strong>First In -</strong></h1> 
<p>As last week progressed, the weather stabilized and I progressed into a 
state of mind of tackling garden shut-down &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; though temps 
were cool. &nbsp;I had already received some motivation Tulips fromBrent and 
Becky&rsquo;s Bulbs!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have never tried this grower before but have read good things about them. 
&nbsp;I ordered Tulipa &lsquo;Orange Emperor&rsquo; and Tulipa &lsquo;Fur 
Elise&rsquo;. The first is a Fosteriana tulip and the latter a Greigii tulip. 
&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve not grown either of these types of tulips before and am 
excited for more interesting foliage (mottled/striped leaves) as well as the 
luscious blooms.</p> 
<p>So the first &ldquo;to do&rdquo; &ndash; &nbsp;get the new tulips in the 
ground! &nbsp;I planted the Tulip &lsquo;Orange Emperor&rsquo; amidst euphorbia 
polychroma, calamagrostis x acutiflora &lsquo;Overdam&rsquo; and veronica 
peduncularis &lsquo;Georgia Blue&rsquo;. &nbsp;If all is timed correctly I 
should have a cheery vignette of bright yellow, bright blue and carrot orange 
with a variety of green foliage come Spring.</p> 
<p>Euphorbia and Reed Grass 'Overdam'</p> 
<p>Veronica 'Georgia Blue'</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When planting tulips, (see Tips for Tulips for more info) I try to <em>
always</em> dig at least a 6 inch deep hole (deeper if possible, although that 
can be hard when planting under a tree) and put a little bone meal and 
compost/peat moss in the bottom before placing the bulb in the hole. &nbsp;I 
amend the unearthed soil with compost and then gently cover the bulbs to the 
surface level. &nbsp;Later, I throw a couple of inches of mulch over the top of 
all of the planted areas.</p> 
<p>Getting the first tulips in the ground makes a gardener feel good. 
&nbsp;They are symbolic of the next Spring that is sure to come and they 
promise new-found life and beauty in the days to come. I believe this is what 
motivates gardeners far and wide to plant once again at the close of a growing 
season.</p> 
<p>Now I need to get the rest of the Spring promises in the ground&hellip; And 
see all these lovely leaves? &hellip;Next task is to get the rake out and 
capture them into the composter. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s another topic for 
another time&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong><em>How about you? &nbsp;What do you do in the Fall to enhance your 
Spring-time delight? &nbsp;How do you motivate yourself to shut-down the garden 
if living in Zone 7 and colder? &nbsp;Do you have any tips for growing tulips?

<h2>Falling For The Fall&nbsp;Garden</h2> 2 Nov 
<p>Fall is glorious! The weather is at its finest in most places across our 
country and the garden changes into a new palette of colorful beauty. &nbsp;I 
have always been a die-hard fan of summer but over the last several years I 
must admit a great growing affection for Fall. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a chance 
that someday soon Fall may be my &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; season!</p> 
<p>The fall garden is sumptuous with all plant life showing off its final size 
and hues of the year.</p> 
<p>My Rosa &lsquo;Glauca&rsquo; went from this to this&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And so many others have changed into Fall &lsquo;attire&rsquo;&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The fall garden is savory with ripe vegetables and fruits filled with 
goodness, all-ready for consumption.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And then there are those that wait&hellip;.and make&nbsp;<em>you</em>
&nbsp;wait &hellip; for their most splendid display of abundance and beauty!</p>
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Falling for the Fall garden is easy to do!</p> 
<p><em>How about you? &nbsp;What is your favorite season in the garden?</em>

<h4>How Do You Like Them&nbsp;Apples!</h4> 
<p>It&rsquo;s time for an update on the apple espalier as the Fall season gets 
underway. As much as I hate to acknowledge there&rsquo;s limited time to 
celebrate the last hurrahs of the growing season in my zone 6 garden I must 
start somewhere&hellip;and what could be better than starting with the Kings of 
Fall -Apples! [...]</p> </li>

<h4>All In A Day&rsquo;s&nbsp;Harvest&hellip;</h4> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been out of the garden again to enjoy some of the other fine 
things in life&hellip; like traveling abroad with my spouse celebrating the 
opportunity to spend time alone together as well as the years we&rsquo;ve been 
together (16). &nbsp;Our trip to France was fabulous and I was inspired by many 
of the simple [...]</p> </li>

<h4>Apple Espalier Makes The&nbsp;Day!</h4> 
<p>Another cool, blustery spring day makes one wonder when the 
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; temps are going to start for this year! &nbsp;Many 
perennials are getting off to a slow start but the cool weather hasn&rsquo;t 
hindered my apple espalier (pronounced es-PAL-yay) one bit. &nbsp;The Fuji 
apple tree has doubled, maybe tripled its blossoms this year making a [...]</p>

<h4>Raise what you sow&hellip;it&rsquo;s a great way to&nbsp;go!</h4> 
<p>Raised beds&hellip;consider them for this garden season. &nbsp;They offer 
many advantages when growing &lsquo;green goods&rsquo; such as vegetables, 
herbs or flowers. &nbsp;The two key advantages raised beds offer are &nbsp;1) 
they can be filled with perfect soil and 2) they provide ideal soil drainage. 
&nbsp;Plus they are very easy to dig in and plant! A&nbsp;raised [...]</p> </li>
