<h1>Adventure Day Trips</h1> <br>
Day Trip: Things to Do in Point Reyes <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s a fact: You simply don&rsquo;t get much more incredible than 
this. Keeping watch at the edge of the earth (in Marin County), the rugged, 
wind-swept&nbsp;Point Reyes National Seashore&nbsp;is a pristine strip of 
quintessential California Coast&mdash;just north of San Francisco and yet 
worlds away. There are tons of activities available in Point Reyes, so 
it&rsquo;s best to check in first at the Bear Valley Visitor Center, where the 
friendly crew</p> <br>
10 Best San Francisco Bay Area Bike Rental Shops <br>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to shell out hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars 
for a flashy bike worthy of the Tour de France in order to enjoy all of the 
beautiful trails that the Bay Area has to offer. Choose to be eco-friendly and 
paycheck-friendly by checking out one of our top 10 bike rental shops in the 
Bay Area. 1. Blazing Saddles | 2715 Hyde Street | San Francisco Boasting</p> 
<br> Best 10-Mile Bike Rides Around San Francisco Bay <br>

<p>If your idea of a fun bike ride doesn&rsquo;t involve full-body spandex and 
an all-day trek up an insurmountable hill, then look no further than the 
10-mile ride. Although the nine-mile loop in our own beloved Golden Gate Park 
may seem hard to beat with its&nbsp;scenic gardens, historic windmills, and 
grazing bison, we discovered there are plenty of short-but-sweet trails near SF 
worth exploring. From training-wheel-friendly family jaunts to rides</p> <br>

22 Best Biking Events in the Bay Area <br>

<p>With urban cycling up 71% since 2006, according to the San Francisco 
Municipal Transit Authority, and an electric bike-share on the way, it&rsquo;s 
no surprise the Bay Area is host to a wide variety of annual bike events, from 
adventurous club outings to celebrity-run fundraisers to casual neighborhood 
rides. Here are our picks for the 22 best bike events in the Bay Area. &nbsp;

10 Best Bay Area Views <br>

<p>Though living in one of the most photographed cities in the world, city 
dwellers have a tendency to forget the unparalleled, natural beauty sitting 
just outside the man-made structures of San Fran proper. Remind yourself why 
your East Coast friends are jealous of your Nor Cal life by taking a good, long 
look at it. Escape the city to visit national parks, restaurants, and vineyards 
for spectacular views of the</p> <br>
Day Trip: Christmas Tree Farms in Half 
Moon Bay and Beyond <br>

<p>REAL or FAKE?&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been embroiled in&nbsp;this debate&nbsp;for 
years now. We&rsquo;re talking Christmas trees, of course, and which is better 
for the environment. Is it better to cut down more of our already disappearing 
forests or to set up ticking time bombs of chemicals in our living rooms? 
With&nbsp;passionate arguments on both sides, it looks like the jury is still 
out on this problem. So what&rsquo;s a treehugger to do when</p> <br>
Day Trip: 
Crown Memorial Beach in Alameda <br>

<p>Located a quick ferry ride from San Francisco, the oft-overlooked island of 
Alameda is home to a wide variety of unique attractions, including the quiet, 
lovely Crown Memorial State Beach, an &nbsp;unassuming two-and-a-half-mile 
stretch of sand with calm waters, a bird sanctuary, and a fascinating 
visitor&rsquo;s center. The quiet shores are a great spot for picnicking, 
flying kites, or just snoozing in the sun. The beach is open 8 a.m.</p> <br>
