<h1>Which is the Better Christmas Tree - Real or Artificial?</h1> 
<p>The debate rages on in some families; shall we get a real tree or a fake 
one? Here are some facts and pros and cons to help you make your decision! In 
2002, 21% of United States households had a real tree, 48% had an artificial 
tree and 32% had no tree.&nbsp; After reading through these facts.. have a 
chuckle at thisChristmas tree made of empty Mountain Dew cans and coat hangers.
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Real Christmas Trees</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Have a great scent - they smell like Christmas</li> 
<li>There is no comparison between buying a fake tree in Wal-Mart vs. taking 
your kids to a real tree farm, having a hayride to the field, chooing a tree 
that is growing and having it cut and tied to you car for you while you have 
some hot chocolate or apple cider!</li> 
<li>Safety - Real Christmas trees are involved in less than one-tenth of one 
percent of residential fires and only when ignited by some external ignition 
sources.</li> 
<li>Are environmentally friendly - Growing Christmas trees provides a habitat 
for wildlife.</li> 
<li>Recycled trees have been used to make sand and soil erosion barriers and 
been placed in ponds for fish shelter.</li> 
<li>Christmas trees remove dust and pollen from the air. </li> 
<li>Artificial trees will last for six years in your home, but for centuries 
in a landfill.</li> 
<li>59 percent of real Christmas trees harvested are recycled in community 
programs. Most trash companies now recycle or chip the trees to make compost.
</li> 
<li>An acre of Christmas trees provides for the daily oxygen requirements of 
18 people.</li> </ul>
<h2>Artificial Christmas Trees</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Artificial trees can be easy to assemble (but many are not) and don't 
require water.</li> 
<li>Artificial trees often come prelit, so you don't need to add lights or 
take them down after Christmas.</li> 
<li>On the other hand, once the lights fail (and we all know some will fail 
within 1 or 2 seasons), they are still stuck to the tree (you can't remove 
them) and you'll have to buy more lights and add them on top of the dead ones.
</li> 
<li>Almost 10 Million fake trees were sold worldwide in 2003. The U.S. 
Commerce Dept. tracks theImport of Fake Trees</li> 
<li>Most fake (artificial) trees (85%) in the U.S. are imported from China; 
buying a fake tree is almost certainly making the national debt worse and 
sending your dollars to China.</li> 
<li>CBS Sunday morning had a story about live vs. artificial Christmas trees 
on Sunday December 10, 2006. You can see more about real vs. fake trees and 
trees made in China on theNCTA website here. </li> </ul>
<p>Economically, environmentally, and emotional.. .there is no doubt; a REAL 
tree is Christmas; A fake tree is China;</p>
