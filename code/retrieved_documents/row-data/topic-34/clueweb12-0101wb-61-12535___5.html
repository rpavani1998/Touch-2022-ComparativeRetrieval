<p> <b>* Where do they come from?</b> </p>
<p> <i>Most fake trees (85%) in the U.S. are imported from China. Almost 10 
Million fake trees were sold worldwide in 2003.</i> </p> <b>* What are the 
factories like where they're made?</b> 
<p> <i>As noted in the Washington Post, &quot;On the concrete floors of 
Zhang's Shuitou Company factory, migrant workers, most earning about $100 a 
month, squat in front of hissing machinery as they melt chips into moildable 
plastic...&quot;</i></p>

<p><i> </i> </p> <b>* What are fake trees made of? </b> 
<p> <i>Most artificial Christmas trees are made of metals and plastics. The 
plastic material, typically PVC, can be a potential source of hazardous lead.
Read a warning about them from the Children's Health Environmental Coalition.
</i> </p> <b>* Why do some artificial trees carry a warning label? </b> 
<p> <i>The potential for lead poisoning is great enough that fake trees made 
in China are required by California Prop 65 to have a warning label.</i></p>
<p><i> Read more about the effects of lead poisoning. </i></p>
<p><i> Learn more about lead in artificial trees. </i></p>
<p><i> View a 2007 report from CNN on the dangers of lead in holiday 
decorations, such as fake trees and wreaths:<br>
</i></p> <i> <b>* Why did the 
USDA quarantine some artificial trees?</b> 
<p> <i>Some fake trees have a wooden center pole. In 2004, the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture placed a quarantine on fake trees from China, which had a 
potentially harmful beetle in the center pole.</i></p>
<p><i> Learn more about the quarantine.</i> <br>
</p> <b>* Who decided to make 
a fake Christmas tree?</b> 
<p> <i>Actually fake trees were invented by a company who made toilet bowl 
brushes, the Addis Brush Company. Regardless of how far the technology has 
come, it's still interesting to know the first fake Christmas trees were really 
just big green toilet bowl brushes.Read the article.</i> </p> <b>* Are fake 
trees really fireproof?</b> 
<p> Overloaded electrical outlets and faulty wires are the most common causes 
of holiday fires in residences - these are just as likely to affect artificial 
trees as Real Trees. See below for examples:<br>

</p>
<p> <i>In 2004, the Farmington Hills Fire Department in metropolitan Detroit 
conducted a test of how real and artificial trees react in a house fire. The 
artificial tree, which was advertised as &ldquo;flame retardant,&rdquo; did 
resist the flames for an amount of time, but then was engulfed in flames and 
projected significant heat andtoxic smoke, containing hydrogen chloride gas and 
dioxin. </i></p>

. <b>* Are fake trees better for the environment?</b> 
<p> As mentioned before, most artificial trees are manufactured in China and 
contain PVC (polyvinyl chloride). In fact, artifical Christmas Trees were 
recently added to theCenter for Health, Environment &amp; Justice's list of 
household products containing PVC. </p>
<p> According to the Children's Health Environmental Coalition, the 
manufacture of PVC creates and disperses dioxins, which include the most toxic 
man-made chemical known. Released into air or water, dioxins enter the food 
chain, where they accumulate in fatty tissues of animals and humans, a 
potential risk for causing cancer, damaging immune functions and impairing 
children's development.</p>
<p> This issue is especially concerning due to China's weak enforcement of 
environmental regulations.<i>Delta Farm Press</i> recently addressed China's 
environmental crisis inthis article. </p>
