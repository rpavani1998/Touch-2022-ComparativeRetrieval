<br>
<b>How 
can I contact a grower who has trees for sale?</b> <br>
 Contact information 
for members of the Watauga County Christmas Tree Association can be found under 
the &#147;Members&#148; heading on our webpage. It is best to contact 
individual farms directly; many can be contacted by phone and email, or through 
farm websites.<br>
<br>
<b>Can I tour a tree farm? </b> <br>
 Throughout the 
year tree farms are continually buzzing with activity. Some growers simply have 
too much farm work to complete and are not able to conduct farm tours. However 
in many cases, with enough advance notice, many Choose and Cut farms will host 
tour groups or school children. If you are interested in a tour, please go to 
our &#147;Contact&#148; page and send us an email with your estimated tour 
date, how many people you anticipate and any other important details.<br>
<br>
