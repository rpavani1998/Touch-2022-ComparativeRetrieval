<h3> Planning for the Future </h3>  Predictions are difficult, especially when 
they're about the future.<br>
<br>
 There's an interesting new website up, 
Wrong Tomorrow, that strives to track and report on the predictions of various 
pundits and prognosticators. Turn out that my prediction that theMexican state 
won't see 2012is up for testing--though, highlighting one weakness of the site, 
it takes my prediction out of context, dropping the first half of my prediction 
that some form of state-shell may exist in Mexico for decades. I didn't intend 
my prediction to be inherently testable or not testable--perhaps in the future 
I will be more careful to conclude with an empirically testable prediction...
<br> <br>
 While predictions and record-keeping can be interesting, and can 
even serve an important purpose by highlighting the past inaccuracies of 
someone offering a new prediction, I'm more interested in the methodology of 
prediction. After all, each of us, every day, stakes our lives and our family's 
lives on our ability to predict the future. I talked briefly about my theory of 
prediction in my essayHedging the Future Solution Space, which highlights that, 
while predictions may be fun, the more utilitarian approach (until I can figure 
out how to be 100% correct in predicting everything) is to outline the 
possibilities and then see how we can make choices today that will fare best 
regardless of the outcome. If you check the investment theory outlined in that 
article, it would have worked out quite well over the past 18 months. I only 
wish I had followed it more closely myself (I was leveraged long oil and short 
the S&amp;P500, but excessively weighted in the former so that my gains in my 
S&amp;P super-bear fund didn't cover my recent losses in oil--though I'm 
holding my 2011 crude oil calls because I still think there's a good chance of 
the price shooting up again).<br>
<br>
 So, over the next few weeks, this will 
be the focus of my posts: the development of a future modeling and 
decision-making methodology that will maximize outcomes in a very uncertain 
future. I'll be focusing on a decision-making system for the individual, but 
many of the principles will work equally well for Nation-States and 
Corporations. In my mind, the key difference between these actors is that it is 
always the individual (as opposed to the currently reigning politician or CEO 
who can just walk away) that ultimately must carry the bag for failure to 
integrate the need for resiliency into our decision making. Therefore a goal of 
my methodology will be to optimize future resiliency in the absence of perfect 
knowledge of the future outcome.<br>

<p> in the comment section a few posts back:<br>
&quot;I don't think people 
will actually revolt unless there is a sudden realization that the dream of 
perpetually increasing material consumption--what all these government programs 
are implicitly selling--is a fantasy. That might happen, but I'm not counting 
on it. I think the ability of the political machine to package itself in an 
acceptable manner exceeds the ability of the masses to broadly see through this 
facade. More likely, in my opinion, is a slow, grinding reduction in the 
overall size of the pie and a simultaneous increase in the relative 
concentration of wealth among a few...&quot;<br>
<br>
That seems to be an 
overarching prediction you have about the future in general.<br>
<br>
My 
overarching prediction is that &quot;Perpetually increasing material 
consumption&quot; will transform, into &quot;perpetually increasing actual 
wealth&quot; and that the economy will continue to grow in the future. It will 
be more solid growth. Kind of like, if the recent past growth has been getting 
fat on junk food, the future growth will be building muscle on health food.<br>

<br>I think this because I think the past OVERALL trend of economic growth 
(Looking at it in terms of decades, even centuries)has been growing muscle on 
health food. Just because there has been a lot of chicanery doesn't change that 
fact.<br>
<br>
So I am just predicting that a past pattern will continue into 
the future. I also think that some basic assumptions of peak oil doomers are 
wrong, because they discount the role of intelligence in economic growth/</p>

<p> The economic system itself is intelligent. Its a collective intelligence, 
like the biosphere is a collective intelligence.<br>
<br>
The economy is 
designed to grow, just like biological life is designed to evolve and diversify 
and spread out.<br>
<br>
My prediction for the future is that the economy and 
the biosphere will begin to grow together in greater harmony. The economy will 
no longer grow at the expense of the biosphere.<br>
<br>
I predict this because 
the economy is a collective intelligence that becomes more intelligent over 
time and this is the smart thing for it to do.<br>
<br>
There is an opportunity 
right now to make a lot of money bringing the economy into harmony with the 
biosphere and growing them together. This is what intelligent people are doing 
like Jigar Shah of Sun Edison.</p> </dd>

<p> Theo,<br>
I believe that your analysis is correct, as far as the end 
result being more in harmony with the bioshpere to the extent this is possible, 
given the constraints of physics.<br>
<br>
My concern is that it will take 
crisis to bring about this particular state. I think what you are advocating is 
what Daly has been teaching for decades. The economy can keep growing in a 
qualitative manner versus a quantitative manner. Unfortunately, intelligence or 
technology can only go so far for so long, again given the constraints of 
physics. Were we to accelarate toward your theory of a qualitative state then 
that finite point would be further into the future</p> </dd>

Theo_musher said... </dt>

<p> Well, one key concept is biomimicry. <br>
<br>
A basic example is 
recycling. Nature recycles everything.<br>
<br>
An excellent resource is a book 
called &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; if you go to Amazon you will find a lot 
of new books on related subjects, like economic growth vs. scarcity.<br>
<br>

IMO all wealth creation is mostly qualitative rather than quantitative. Even 
resource extraction has to do with intelligence. You can't make money of any 
commodity without said commodity being able to be put to intelligent use. Like 
oil. if there were no machines, no pesticides, no plastics, no pharmacuticals, 
it would have no value.<br>
<br>
There needs to be a shift to renewable 
resources but the economy will still continue to grow. Intelligence is not 
going to reach an endpoint any time soon.</p> </dd>

<p> I am reading Lovins book now on Natural Capitalism among others and I 
agree with you, nature does recycle everything. The end result, ultimately, is 
heat. I am a huge fan of Amory Lovins. I am not a dooms dayer by any means and 
I think that what Lovins espouses is a path that we should strive for. I do 
think that Amory Lovins would be the first to admit that we do live on a finite 
planet and that his solutions are temporary when taken in the context of the 
huge picture.</p> </dd>

<p> Interesting. I just ordered (from the library) a couple books by Herman 
Daly. I just found out one of them &quot;Steady State Economics&quot; is 
available online.<br>
<br>
Here is an interesting quote:<br>
<br>
&quot;Should 
we, by a kind of reverse land reform, reinstate a landlord class? Landlord rent 
is unearned income, and we find income based on ownership of that which no one 
produced to be ethically distasteful. No one loves a landlord. Adam Smith tells 
us that landlords love to reap where they have never sown, and not many lament 
the historical demise of the landowning aristocracy. But not all the long-run 
consequences of this demise are favorable. Rent may be an illegitimate source 
of income, but it is a totally legitimate and necessary price, without which 
efficient allocation of scarce resources would be impossible. Henry George said 
let rent be charged but then tax it away. Socialists, after trying to get along 
without rent, now say charge some rent but pay it to the government, who is now 
the landlord. In the United States neither of these things has happened. The 
largest resource owner, the government, has followed a give-away and low price 
policy, both on resources it owns and on those, such as natural gas, whose 
price it regulates (Energy Policy Project, 1974, Chapter 11). It has done this 
to favor certain capitalists, to promote growth, and to ease the labor-capital 
conflict and win votes in both camps.&quot;<br>
<br>
He's explaining why 
resources are such a low percentage of GDP and why the price of scarce, 
mon-renewable resources is so low.<br>
<br>
I actually think a Landlord Class 
is going to re-emerge. I envision a Green type of corporate feudalism, which I 
don't think will be as scary as people think.<br>
<br>
There are other 
collective models that might work also. But there needs to be more intelligent 
allocation of resources. People that are in a position to do this through 
technological innovation are in a position to make a lot of money. Like 
innovations in solar technology. The Sun is not going to grow, but the ability 
to capture usable energy from it will grow with investment in that sector.</p>

<p> This is the economic model of the future:<br>
<br>

http://www.princeofdubai.com/<br>
<br>
Dubai is archaic yet modern, arguably 
the most modern city its controlled by a feudal monarchy.<br>
<br>
The future 
of economic growth is massive green development projects in the developing 
world. The income from this model will be in the form of rent. Success will be 
measured by the ability to provide a high quality of life and attract people to 
live there.<br>
<br>
SunEdison, follows this model in a way also, even though 
its not a real estate development project. But the income is all from PPV's. So 
in a way its like the income is from rent. Its renting the use of the sun to 
people, through giving the equipment that captures the energy away for free.</p>

Lonnie said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> What about the developed countries? Where does economic growth lie for 
them? You are not suggesting that the developed countries are the landlords for 
these massive green developments so as to provide economic growth in the 
neoclassical sense are you?<br>
<br>
It's about scale, ultimately. Less 
population coupled with less consumption. Tax the resource to limit use not the 
value added which encourages consumption.</p> </dd>

Theo_musher said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> Well, here are the trends:<br>
<br>
Jetson Green Green Books<br>
<br>

Growth will be in making everything Green. Big Green development projects. One 
way this is talking place is real estate development firms going into 
economically depressed areas, with brownfields and doing bioremdiation and 
creating huge Green developments. LEED certification green roofing, paperless 
construction, buildings that generate their own power etc. and all that stuff. 
One example is<br>
<br>
Destiny USA.<br>
<br>
So the trend is to take worthless 
land. So my thought is that this would work especially well in many areas in 
the third world. I am not implying it will be all Western Companies doing it. 
There can no doubt be partnerships. But anyway, the model that is being used in 
Canada and the US can be used in the developing world. I think the most 
opportunity is there for growth. Its easier to start from scratch.</p> </dd> 
<dd>  5:45 PM </dd> 
<dt> <br>
Lonnie said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> Theo,<br>
I looked at Destiny USA and it seems to be business as usual to 
my unsophisticated eye. I don't see it as any kind of paradigmatic shift. It 
looks like more of the same 'green' marketing to get us to come and buy more 
stuff that we really don't necessarily need. I'm the first one in line to buy 
it. Any project that touts 1 million square feet of retail space is just the 
same ole same ole.<br>
<br>
My belief is that we will experience a devolution 
of sorts. Mom and pop will ultimately survive the large developments. Again, I 
think it's all about scale. Maybe that is simply because I'm too dense to grasp 
the big scale of such a project. But, 'sustainable' is thrown around a lot in 
marketing and it really isn't ultimately close to being sustainable. My 2 cents.

<dd> 
<p> Theo,<br>
You will get no argument from me that Green Building is the ONLY 
way to build. My case is simply that Green Building is not the ANSWER, just 
part of a shorter term remedy. Green Building will not sustain perpetual 
growth, that's my only point.<br>
<br>
It just seems counter intuitive to call 
a million square foot retail space 'green'. Maybe I'm just ignorant.</p> </dd>

<p> Three of the top Ten Green Skyscrapers are there. Its a desert.<br>
<br>

Its not like they are clear cutting the Rain forest to build there. There was 
nothing there in the 1960's. Its not oil money that built it either. Its 
audacity. People able to think big.<br>
<br>
Its a hub basically to develop 
Africa. We have the technology toGreen the Desert<br>
<br>
We can green the 
entire middle East and then build Massive Green cities on sustainable bases of 
local food and energy production, wheras before it was a wasteland.<br>
<br>

That's growth.</p> </dd>

<p> The key is to make healing the land profitable. Once you are able to do 
that, you heal the land and create economic growth. The economy grows as 
ecological health grows.<br>
<br>
So if you are really committed to continuing 
to be pessimitic, you have too choices:<br>
<br>
Deny that healing the ecology 
can ever be profitable.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Claim that there is no room for 
healing the environment. Which is really silly, because its so obvious.</p>

<p> I said I would shut up...but<br>
<br>
I'm not sure this is 'healing' the 
environment. Unless, Las Vegas is healing the environment. It is manipulating 
the environment in an energy intensive way.<br>
<br>
Rehabilitating those rain 
forest and retrofitting existing infrastucture to be 'greener' is more akin to 
'healing' the environment. Creating resorts in the desert on slave labor wages 
isn't qualitative growth.</p> </dd>

So far you don't seem to get what I am 
saying. Lots of people we share the Earth aren't hippies and aren't going to 
either become hippies or die anytime soon.<br>
<br>
So that means we have to 
all work together. Its just a fact that there is lots of green development 
going on in Dubai. It doesn't matter if its not your taste. Lots of people are 
motivated by making money. I am saying you can have permaculture and also 
spectacular real estate development projects such as skyscrapers.</p> </dd>

<p> Its the possibilities of the region that capture my imagination. <br>
Any 
thing seems possible in the UAE from a design standpoint:<br>
<br>
Zero 
Emissions city in the Deset<br>
<br>
Who could have predicted this? </p> </dd> 
<dd>  10:56 PM </dd> 
<dt> <br>
 Neven said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> How much emissions does it cost to build this zero emissions city? How 
much emissions does it cost to get water and food to that region? It's in the 
desert, right? Nowadays you can add -wash to most of the plans that use the 
word 'green' in it.<br>
<br>
I believe there will have to be some kind of 
contraction first to get people to wake up, and then, if enough knowledge is 
conserved, then perhaps, after quite some time and quite some sacrifices, yes, 
the economy might grow in the sense Theo_musher alludes to. But first people's 
consciousness has to alter radically.<br>
<br>
There are too many global 
problems at the moment for the intelligent economy to solve. It would take a 
lot of sacrifice, quantitatively and qualitatively, sacrifice people aren't 
prepared for and aren't prepared to make unless they have to. Either they stick 
their head in the sand, or they come up with optimist visions such as 
Theo_musher's. One could call that stick your head in Dubai sand. ;-)<br>
<br>

The Problem of Growth-series on this blog is the best stuff by far I have read, 
because it addresses the root cause of all the global problems and then 
proposes solutions. Everything else I have read so far on the topic of 
solutions is old thinking (what did Einstein say about that?) and greenwash.<br>
<br>In my view we all have to take two steps back and once we have done this, 
take a long, hard look at how things stand and then take a step forward or even 
better: sideways. I've decided to dedicate at least a few years at making Jeff 
Vail's idea of Rhizome reality. It's the best way for me and the world around 
me.</p> </dd>

This is a good Slate article on 
&quot;What else could we be wrong about?&quot;<br>
<br>
It examines failures of 
&quot;experts&quot; to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11, and the lack 
of WMD's in Iraq, the economic crash of 2008-??, and then asks &quot;what if 
we're wrong about other conventional assumptions&quot;.</p> </dd>

<dd> 
<p> I was doing some reading up on George Mobus' excellent 
QuestionEverything-blog, and this piece reminded me of the problem I have with 
the way Theo_musher presents his case:<br>
<br>
&quot;So the G-20 is meeting in 
London to figure out the best logistics and tactics to restore the global 
economy to its prior growth-oriented consumer-based ways. There is no strategic 
thought here at all. The strategy is 'Let's do what we did before because, 
well, that is what we did before and it all seemed to work OK.' Until it didn't.
<br><br>
And most of the world wants that to happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What 
is the foolishness here? That even though the reality of energy's relation to 
economic activity, and the latter's relation to global warming, and all of it 
related to overpopulation, is obvious to anyone who bothers to look, people 
still avoid facing the truth. Because the truth implies sacrifice and hard 
manual labor and giving up toys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The human subconscious is 
a marvel for turning rational thinking into rationalizing in order to satisfy 
emotional demands. And our unconscious minds are fantastic at avoiding any 
sense of self-blame for anything that is going wrong in our world.&quot;<br>

It explains how

<br>
Are you sure you don't have an emotional agenda

<br><br>
Would it upset you if people people started making money in a green 
collar economy? Its already happening, sorry to say. I mean. I'm not sorry 
about it. The most profitable construction projects to make right now are green 
buildings.<br>

Demand for Grass fed beef is estimated to be 10 times

<p> Here's a good example of a Failed doom prediction by Kuntsler </p> </dd> 
<dd>  7:59 PM </dd> 
<dt> <br>
Theo_musher said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> Jeff is either ignoring me or too busy to post (which is likely being a 
lawyer with a family)<br>
<br>
But anyway Jeff, I think what gets in the way of 
accurately predicting the future is wishful thinking.<br>
<br>
In James 
Kuntsler's case he hates sub-urbia. So he wishes it would go away. First he 
predicts Y2K will utterly wipe it out, then Peak Oil. Lately, I think he 
assumes its too late for any of his urban planning ideas to come to fruition. 
So he's just basically a pessimist.<br>
<br>
I think pessimism is another 
distortion. It causes people to look at positive people with a jaundiced eye. 
By positive, in this case I mean &quot;action oriented&quot; Nietzsche talked 
about the &quot;slave morality&quot; and the &quot;master morality&quot; that's 
pretty loaded with bad (or unPC) connotations, but I still think the basic 
premise is sound. Robert Anton Wilson thought so too.<br>
<br>
He designed four 
quadrants of interpersonal styles.<br>
Hostile Strength/Friendly Strength<br>

Hostile Weakness/Friendly Weakness<br>
<br>
I think most peak oil doomers are 
in the lower left quadrant. I think many people high up in the Military are in 
the upper left quadrant. I am sure some are decent people. But they are in the 
killing bussiness. Nukes, for example just aren't friendly anyway you lok at 
it. People with an interpersonal style of hostile strength IME show lack of 
creativity. They just like to control things other people have created.<br>
<br>
I think people like Geoff Lawton are in the &quot;Friendly Strength&quot; 
quadrant. There are lots of other people in thnat quadrant that are concerned 
about the environment but are also &quot;go getter&quot; type people. They 
aren't worried about passively predicting the future. They are concerned with 
making the future.<br>
<br>
That takes us to the third distortion I see. And 
that is a materialistic worldview. A materialistic worldview tends to 
negativity because it is inherently passive. Many with this worldview don't 
even recognize the possibility for the existence of people in the top right 
quadrant.<br>
<br>
They don't believe in free will. So they tend to look at 
everything in the Universe as mechanical and constantly in the process of 
winding down. They see mostly inertia and the second law of thermo-dynamics 
winding down.</p> </dd>

<p> Theo,<br>
First, I want to thank Jeff for his essays. I just found this 
site a couple of weeks ago and have been reading with interest and checking out 
blog history as much as I can. I am mostly a lurker just trying to absorb the 
amount of information that needs to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
So, I decided to 
start giving my opinion for the first time here on this blog...<br>
<br>
I am a 
middle aged man, I make a very decent living and I would consider myself at the 
top of the consumer chain. Based on my limited posting to you, Theo, I came 
away from our last conversation thinking that you might think:<br>
<br>
 a) I 
am a hippie<br>
 b) I am a pessimist<br>
 c) I am a dooms dayer<br>
 d) I am 
not a forward thinking person<br>
 e) I believe I am right<br>
<br>
Sorry to 
dissapoint you but in my mind none of these things apply. No one can predict 
the future, we can look at the present and the past and try to rectify our 
mistakes and move on. As a college student many years ago, I considered myself 
an environmentalist and idealist. I studied forestry and found out I was not 
willing to make the monetary sacrifices to excel in my field. I took the well 
worn path and now think it might have been a mistake, or not. Now 30 years 
later, I am rediscovering Daly and Boulding, Leopold and Lovins. It all makes 
more sense, now, because I have witnessed it first hand.<br>
<br>
My motive for 
becoming involved and investigating is 'action oriented' and not because I 
think or know I am right. I would much rather you be right, Theo.<br>
<br>
Here 
is the ultimate dilema for you, though:<br>
<br>
My basic belief that 
technology will not overcome entropy and that there are going to be 
consequences, will be a mere blip on the radar if your theory ultimately proves 
correct. I can start conserving, live in a commune or a tent in the woods...it 
won't change the outcome of your theory.<br>
<br>

<p> Believe it or not Lonnie, the key to overcoming the problem of entropy is 
in understanding the relation between quantum physics and spirituality. If our 
Brains are Quantum computers able to access a greater reality that 
interpenetrates the material world, then we don't live in a closed system.<br>

<br>The fact is, we have never lived in a closed system. The proof is all the 
biological life we see all around is. It all represents negative entropy.<br>

<br>The human mind is an even superior negative entropy creator than Mother 
nature, her self.<br>
<br>
This isn't a new development, its just a reality 
that is hidden from people with a mechanical materialistic Newtonian worldview.

<p> Materialists simply cannot factor in true human creativity. They can't 
factor in free will. They can't factor in human consciousness at all. Except to 
say that its something that some how leaks out of our brains like insulin leaks 
out of our pancreases.</p> </dd>

<p> Kale, <br>
<br>
You really don't know? I didn't simply make up the concept 
of &quot;negative entropy.&quot; It was a major premise of the ideas of Karl 
Popper, Buckminster Fuller, and in a sense, Pierre Tielhard De Chardin, Erwin 
Shr&ouml;dinger.<br>
<br>
These are the philosophers I believe Robert Anton 
Wilson picked up the concept from for his book &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;<br>
<br>So its out there. </p> </dd>

<p> Cool. No problem. Here is an excellent article about Bucky's take on it<br>
<br>Meetings with Remarkable Buckminster Fuller<br>
<br>
&quot;He was very 
approachable, very warm and saintly, radiating a very loving aura &ndash; in 
sharp contrast to Herman Kahn who was hugely aloof and sneering, radiating 
little warmth. In the two men you could see the polarities of intellectual 
vision. Kahn was convinced that the planet was in deep trouble and that 
Malthusian economics dictated Darwinian survival strategies (e.g., he advocated 
and defended America&rsquo;s policy of exporting pollution to Third World 
countries). Fuller, on the other hand, was convinced that Universe is sentient, 
that Cosmic Intelligence always prevails, and that cooperation, not 
competition, was the key to real progress. Mentally I called Herman &ldquo;Fat 
Hope&rdquo; and Bucky &ldquo;Slim Chance.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Within hours I had 
decided Bucky would make the ideal grandfather. So when I found him sitting one 
row behind me at one of the talks, I scribbled my request on a sheaf of 
conference notes and handed it to him: &ldquo;Do I have your permission to 
adopt you as my grandfather?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Bucky scrawled an unhesitating 
response: &ldquo;Indeed you do! It gives me great joy and an increase of 
responsibility.&rdquo; This simple act proved to me that Bucky represented the 
noblest spirit of humanity, the archetypal Community Elder who has grown beyond 
tribal concerns and was in effect one of the True Sages of Planet Earth. Such 
beings are not universally recognized under the military-industrial power 
structure &ndash; but I&rsquo;m sure that as the Aquarian Age proceeds, they 
will come into their own.&quot;<br>
<br>
So the extrapolation I am making is 
that the Universe is Sentient, Life feeds off Negative Entropy, We human beings 
are by extention alive and sentient also and have the ability to Order the 
Universe even faster than Mother Nature.</p> </dd>
