<h3>SGE Review</h3> 
<p>Did you know that on average college graduates earn almost twice as much as 
high school graduates? Here&rsquo;s required reading for parent&rsquo;s who 
need advice on setting up educational plans for their children. Even parents 
with short time horizons can develop individual education plans. According to 
this article, the average cost for a public college is $14,333 and a private 
school is $34,132, per year. Read about how taking a proactive stance now can 
ensure your child all the financial resource needed to achieve their higher 
educational goals.</p> 
<h3>Full Article</h3> 
<p><strong>Planning For The Cost Of Higher Education</strong></p> 
<p>On average, male and female college graduates with a bachelor&rsquo;s 
degree earn 60% and 65% more per year, respectively, than high school graduates 
[1]. Clearly, one of the best investments you can make for your children is an 
investment in their educational future.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You may think that setting up a bank savings account for your 
two-year-old&rsquo;s education will get him or her off to a great start. You 
might, however, want to think again. According to the College Board&rsquo;s<i>
Trends in College Pricing 2008</i> and Standard &amp; Poor's, the projected 
average cost for your newborn's four-year degree at a public college could 
exceed $150,000. You would have to sock away almost $5,100 per year in a 
savings account, assuming it earns interest at a hypothetical&nbsp;average rate 
of 8% per year and that college costs rise at a rate of 5% annually, to equal 
that amount by his or her freshman year. And should your child decide to attend 
a private college, tack on about $207,000 more to your savings goal, bringing 
your savings account annual contribution to more than $12,000.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But don&rsquo;t despair yet. Even without time on your side &mdash; if your 
children are teenagers, for example &mdash; a sound investment strategy coupled 
with knowledge of other college financing options may put your children on the 
road to a valuable four-year college degree [1].</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Invest Early And On A Regular Schedule</strong></p> 
<p>As with any large savings goal, it&rsquo;s best to start investing early 
and often for college. First, set your goal: Figure out how much you may need 
to save for each child based on his/her age (see accompanying table). Then, 
develop an investment plan and stick with it. Consider discussing the following 
guidelines with your financial professional when developing your investment 
plan.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>If Your Final Tuition Bill Is Due In 12 To 22 Years&hellip;</strong>
</p> 
<p>With time on your side, your portfolio can potentially withstand a bit of 
volatility in your quest for higher return potential. You might want to 
consider investing the majority of your college-saving assets in stocks and 
stock mutual funds as measured by the S&amp;P 500, as these investments have 
historically provided the greatest long-term growth potential. Of course, past 
performance is not indicative of future results. For example, a one-dollar 
investment made in the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Composite Index of 500 
Stocks (an unmanaged index of common stocks generally considered representative 
of the U.S. stock market ) at the end of 1988 would have grown to $5.05 by 
year-end 2008 [2]. Comparing that to an equal amount invested in lower-risk, 
lower-returning money market investments over the same period of time, and your 
investment would have amounted to only $2.41 [3].</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, past performance cannot guarantee future results. You must 
remember the volatility and risks involved in stock investing and consider your 
ability to withstand potential fluctuations in the value of your child&rsquo;s 
college savings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>[2] Source: Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s. Performance is for the period Jan. 
1, 1989, to Dec. 31, 2008. Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Composite Index of 500 
Stocks is an unmanaged index generally considered representative of the U.S. 
large-cap stock market. Money market accounts are represented by the return of 
3-month Treasury bills. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 
Individuals cannot invest directly in any index. Results include reinvested 
dividends. Keep in mind that unlike investments, which involve risk and 
possible loss of principal, bank savings accounts are FDIC-insured.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>[3] An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. 
Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per 
share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. Money market 
accounts are represented by returns of 3-month Treasury bills.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>If Your Final Tuition Bill Is Due In 8 To 11 Years</strong></p> 
<p>In addition to keeping your portfolio aimed toward growth potential with 
stocks and stock mutual funds, you might want to add or increase a fixed-income 
element to balance risk. Also, now is probably a good time to teach your child 
about investing &mdash; by encouraging that a portion of the dollars earned 
through paper routes and babysitting be contributed to the college savings plan.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>If Your Final Tuition Bill Is Due In Less Than 8 Years</strong></p> 
<p>You may start allocating more of your portfolio to fixed-income and money 
market investments. If you have virtually nothing saved, you have a challenge 
ahead of you, but some cost-cutting in other areas of your life might allow you 
to make substantial monthly investments. The less you have saved, the more you 
may need to be aggressive in your investments in seeking higher returns, as 
long as you have the appropriate risk tolerance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p> 
<p>Although many investments, including stocks and bonds, have traditionally 
outpaced savings accounts in terms of performance, past performance cannot 
guarantee future results. Bear in mind, too, that unlike savings accounts, 
investments are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC); therefore, negative performance could&nbsp;result in a loss.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Also remember that any investment plan needs a fresh look every year or so 
to determine whether adjustments need to be made. Generally, changes should be 
made as your time horizon narrows, the day nears when you will send your child 
off to college, and preservation of principal becomes a primary concern.</p> 
<h3>Other Financing Options</h3> 
<p>Beginning your investment plan by considering the time frame available to 
you is probably your best bet in seeking to meet college costs. In addition, 
consider these options:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Encourage Savings Gifts</p> 
<p>When relatives ask what your children want for birthdays or holidays, 
encourage gifts that will help finance their education. Though it may not be a 
child&rsquo;s first choice now, they&rsquo;ll thank you later. Such gifts 
include Series EE Savings Bonds; shares of a mutual fund given through the 
Uniform Gifts/Transfers to Minors Acts (UGMA/UTMA); and zero-coupon bonds
&Dagger;&Dagger; that mature in a given year around college enrollment. 
[Parents or others can contribute up to $2,000 annually (per child) to a 
Coverdell Education Savings Account (formerly known as the Education IRA) where 
any earnings can accumulate tax-free and qualified withdrawals can be made 
tax-free for qualified college expenses.&Dagger;&Dagger;&Dagger;] An individual 
can make annual gifts of up to $13,000, gift tax-free (in 2009), to a minor 
under UGMA/UTMA. And friends and family can pay any amount directly to a 
youngster&rsquo;s college for tuition and fees, with no gift-tax consequences.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Remember to consult your tax advisor on the tax considerations of each of 
these gifts so you&rsquo;re not caught off guard by Uncle Sam.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Apply for Financial Aid</strong></p> 
<p>Even if you think you&rsquo;re ineligible for financial aid, complete the 
applications and mail them in on time. According to the College Board, there 
was more than $135 billion in financial aid available during 2007, the most 
recent year studied.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Rule Out Less Expensive Schools.</strong></p> 
<p>Public universities and community colleges can be among the best options. 
Higher education is certainly one area where most expensive does not 
necessarily mean best.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Develop Networks And Ask Questions.</strong></p> 
<p>High-school guidance counselors, religious and civic organizations, and the 
colleges your child applies to can all provide good leads for additional 
sources of scholarships, grants, and loans. The more you ask, the more you will 
learn.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Conduct Research</strong></p> 
<p>Many organizations, including the U.S. government, offer alternatives such 
as loans and grants to help finance higher education.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Together, time and a smart investing strategy comprise your best bet for 
meeting the rising costs of higher education. Combine that bet with a little 
creativity and a lot of information, and you can help provide your children 
with an investment that no one can take away: a college education.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In this process, which can be daunting, your financial professional can be 
a valuable resource.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that the value of zero-coupon bonds fluctuates more than 
regular funds and therefore may not be suitable for investors with liquidity 
needs.</p> 
<p>Income restrictions apply, and penalties may be assessed for nonqualified 
withdrawals.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Points To Remember:</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li>On average college graduates earn about twice as much per year as 
high-school graduates.</li> 
<li>To help meet rising college costs, build an investment strategy: Determine 
how much you&rsquo;ll need, choose proper investments, and invest regularly.
</li> 
<li>Longer time horizons are an opportunity to potentially benefit from growth 
stock and stock fund investments.</li> 
<li>As your time horizon shortens, adjustments may need to be made in your 
college saving portfolio.</li> 
<li>Encourage savings gifts from friends and relatives.</li> 
<li>Apply for financial aid, even if you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re 
eligible.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t rule out less expensive schools.</li> </ol> Original Article

<p>Do you like coach? <strong>coach factory outlet</strong> And do you like 
black? I like them! Most of time, no matter what season it is, I will choose 
black as my main color for fashion. And I am a coach girl, so in my wardrobe, 
you can find many kinds of<strong>fake designer handbags</strong>: bags, shoes, 
wallets, and any other coach accessories.<br>
<br>
 And today, I just show you 
one of my new collection: new coach snap gloves and new coach devin leather 
shoulder<strong>Replica designer handbags</strong>! They are perfect pairs 
every time, I think! The glove is vintage, elegant and lovely, with distinctive 
detailing at the cuff: a sophisticated design in soft premium leather that 
takes color beautifully.<br>
<br>
 And the coach shoulder purse black is a deep 
tote in soft, radiant leather, with a big front turnlock clasp pocket. sides 
unzip to expand and reveal coordinating patent leather interior. If you like 
this style, you can go to your local coach outlet store to have look, or you 
can go online coach store, maybe there you can share a big discount<strong>
Coach outlet</strong> ! <br>
