<h3>Abstract</h3> 
<p>Scientific and Fabrication<br>
<br>
 The disciplines represented in the 
College of Built Environments are focused on creation - of buildings, 
landscapes, urban spaces. In service of this concentration, the College has a 
strong tradition of design/build programs, and of the fostering of skills that 
enable students to build finely-wrought prototypes, models, and furniture.<br>

<br> Over the last few years, we have begun to incorporate digital design and 
fabrication technologies into the College's extensive shops, serving student 
research and curriculum incorporating wood, metal, concrete, plastics and 
composite materials. While we have accomplished much, there is much left to do.
<br> <br>
 In this proposal, we seek funding to expand the shops' digital 
fabrication facilities to meet student demand, and to provide students with a 
broader range of options for exploration of the design/production process.<br>

</p> 
<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>Gould Hall houses a large, fully staffed and equipped hands-on shop. This 
facility provides students with the space and equipment needed to design and 
build models, furniture, prototypes and full-scale building components. A 
particularly strong tradition has grown through the offering of Furniture 
Studios, during which students use the shops to produce beautifully designed 
and finely-crafted furniture, much of which has garnered regional and national 
awards.<br>
<br>
 In recent years, the mission of the shops - to provide a 
venue for students to explore and develop great facility in the iterative 
process relating design/concept to physical manifestation - has been augmented 
by the addition of digital fabrication tools, including a large-format CNC 
router, CNC plasma cutter, laser cutters, digitizers and a 3D printer. 
Contributions from donors and the College have made it possible for students to 
begin to integrate CNC production practice into their process.<br>
<br>
 But 
we're only partway there. Significant digital fabrication processes remain 
unavailable to CBE students (and to other students across the UW with whom they 
collaborate). Examples include modern precision production, the integration of 
wire and tubing into the range of available materials through the use of a 
digitally-controlled wire/tubing bender, integration of fabric (including the 
creation of inflatable structural elements and flexible concrete forms) using a 
fabric plotter/cutter, and the integration of precision measurement tools for 
large spaces.<br>
<br>
 This proposal seeks to address these needs through the 
purchase of several pieces of digital fabrication/measurement equipment and 
associated software.<br>
</p> 
<h3>Benefits</h3> 
<p>The nearly 300 students using the shops each year will benefit from many 
opportunities afforded by the availability of the proposed equipment, among 
which are:<br>
<br>
 - Exploration of precision production processes, which are 
increasingly important in the professional world as efficient, 
resource-responsible production becomes more critical.<br>
<br>
 - Exploration 
of the design and construction options and opportunities implicit in wire-frame 
construction and precision metal forming.<br>
<br>
 - Integration of flexible, 
fabric-based and fabric-like materials into the materials palette from which 
students develop their designs.<br>
<br>
 - Higher precision measurement and 
analysis of existing spaces, enabling a more nuanced understanding of how 
spaces work (or don't), and the exploration of a fully-digital practice 
incorporating digital measurement, digital design and downstream digital 
fabrication, and digitally-enabled and enhanced installation.<br>
<br>
 STF 
Committee Questions:<br>
<br>
 Who will maintain the materials? CBE Shops and 
Computing staff.<br>
<br>
 How will the materials be maintained? Routine 
maintenance (e.g. calibration, lubrication) will be performed per 
manufacturer's recommendations. Non-routine issues will be addressed by Shops 
and/or Computing staff (depending on the type of issue), with assistance from 
vendor support as needed.<br>
<br>
 Who will have access to these materials and 
when? CBE students who have completed training on the equipment will be able to 
use it during regular Shop hours (generally weekdays, but also weekends during 
busy periods).<br>
<br>
 How will you track usage? Using the reservation / 
calendar system we have in place for existing equipment. Login tracking is 
available as well, for equipment that is driven by a standard PC.<br>
<br>
 How 
will you market your resources to students? CBE student orientations, 
announcements in CBE studio classes, College web sites, presentations, 
word-of-mouth.<br>
<br>
 What level of training would be required to use the 
materials? Basic CBE shop safety training, plus machine-specific training would 
allow supervised use of the equipment. Advanced machine-specific training is 
available to enable students to take advantage of more complex functions and 
capacities.<br>
<br>
 What activities do the proposal authors believe the 
students will use the computers/software/hardware for? Manufacturing furniture, 
furnishings, building components, models, prototypes, student research 
activities.<br>
<br>
 How often will the materials be used? The equipment would 
be integrated into normal use of the shops, so would be used daily when the 
University is in session.<br>
<br>
 How does it add to the prestige of the 
university? Availability of this equipment would significantly enhance the UW's 
existing reputation for furniture design, prototype/model work, and production 
- helping students become more marketable, expanding opportunities for 
interdisciplinary work with other departments and outside entities, and 
attracting ambitious and talented students wanting to work with a wide array of 
fabrication and production tools. It would emphasize and reinforce the 
College's dedication to the wide vocabulary of current building and structural 
design, in the context of an effective and nuanced understanding of structural 
realities.<br>
<br>
 Do other universities nearby have these resources? No 
(with the possible exception of the proposed laser measurement device).<br>
</p>
<h3>Student Access</h3> 
<p>All 700-plus CBE students, as well as any UW students working with them on 
projects, are eligible to use the shops during their regular staffed hours. 
These are typically weekdays, with weekend hours available during busy periods.
</p> 
<h3>Available Resources</h3> 
<p>Ongoing maintenance, operations, and support costs associated with this 
proposal would be covered by the CBE Shops and CBE Computing operations 
budgets. These budgets are sufficient to cover ongoing costs associated with 
this proposal.<br>
<br>
 The shops are supported by 1.5 FTE of technical staff 
members, plus approximately 1.5 FTE of highly-skilled student (TA) support.<br>

<br> Student computing in the College is supported by 2 FTE of technical staff 
members plus approximately 2 FTE of student help desk staff. Other College 
technical staff members are available to provide additional and/or specialized 
support as needed.<br>
<br>
 CBE Computing would provide any incidental 
computing equipment or software needed to bring this project to fruition.</p> 
<h3>Installation Timeline</h3> 
<p>All items would be ordered as soon as funds became available, and would be 
processed and deployed upon arrival.</p> 
<h3>Departmental Endorsement</h3> 
<p>Dear Colleagues:<br>
<br>
 Please accept my endorsement of all the 
college's 2011 STF proposals. These proposals address our direct and immediate 
need to maintain and extend students' access to state-of-the art digital tools 
upon which our disciplines increasingly depend. Effective representation of and 
interaction with visual and graphic information, as well as interactive process 
modeling, the acquisition and analysis of data in the field and the 
straightforward production of physical prototypes from digital models, have 
become key to the design and construction of our shared built environment. 
Access to current versions of essential applications, large interactive 
displays, improved plotting and digital fabrication capabilities, and a more 
robust capacity for student use of digital technology in the field directly 
affect the quality of design inquiry and the student experience throughout the 
college. The upgrades and enhancements represented by these proposals would 
therefore directly strengthen the college's core mission.<br>

 To the 
Committee,<br>
<br>
 I am writing in support of funding for STF2011-28 (CBE 
Student Digital Fabrication Equipment). Some of my teaching is in the specific 
area of Digital Design &amp; Fabrication, and outside of my classes I support a 
great deal of student work (through tutorials, one-on-one instruction and 
demonstrations) using the digital fabrication facilities in the College of 
Built Environments.<br>
<br>
 I have initiated the formation of digital 
fabrication facilities in design school environments since the early 1990's, 
first at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and later at the 
Yale School of Architecture. I have also incorporated their use in my own 
design and fabrication practice. When I was hired as an assistant professor in 
the Department of Architecture at UW I planned and implemented the installation 
of a number of digitally-enabled tools and have worked toward the development 
of a mature digital-design culture amongst our students. It has been rewarding 
to watch how quickly and deeply our new digital resources have affected student 
activities in a number of areas, for both classes and independent research. We 
have been able to provide training to hundreds of students, who enjoy 
unfettered access to our tools.<br>
<br>
 The development of design strategies 
is deeply personal - every student finds their own way to implement what they 
learn as they determine exactly what direction their practice will take. Access 
to digital-design &amp; downstream digital fabrication resources assists many 
of our students in experiencing an alternate form of design practice that is at 
once compelling, timely, and competitive. Adding more tools to fill in gaps and 
provide greater range is an ongoing interest for the College of Built 
Environments. I strongly support this effort and would gladly answer questions 
related to the proposal if needed.<br>
<br>
 Very truly yours,<br>

 Cutting-edge education in 
digital design and fabrication technologies coupled with the experience of 
using up-to-date fabrication tools, such as the CNC wire bender, digital 
measuring tools and fabric plotter, as listed in your proposal, are invaluable 
to the advancement of students in the College of Built Environments. Digital 
design &amp; Fabrication is a rapidly growing field into which the University 
of Washington has an opportunity to send its best designers while equipping 
them with the experience necessary to achieve the highest standards of success. 
By continuing to grow the available tools in the CBE shop, the UW offers its 
students the highest quality education available and distinguishes itself as a 
leader of education in Digital Design &amp; Fabrication. As a student, I am 
extremely excited about the opportunity to use these new tools and to see them 
incorporated into the technologically progressive shop within the CBE. Thank 
you for taking the time to help us secure these vital resources. It is with 
great enthusiasm that I encourage the Student Technology Fee to fund these 
important tools.<br>

 I am writing in support 
of the proposal submitted by Mark Baratta to fund development of the digital 
fabrication infrastructure in the College of Built Environments. I am both a 
current student and an alumnus of the Department of Architecture and have been 
involved in the curriculum both in a traditional shop context and the now 
developing digital fabrication realm. I feel that any investment in the CBE 
shop advances the quality of architectural education as well as the quality of 
the professionals produced by the university. Indeed, my experiences in the 
shop were formative in my design work today and my current experience in the 
digital fabrication shop advance this thinking. Advancing the college through 
investment in digital fabrication equipment will have a profound impact on the 
quality of student and professional work. Thank you for your consideration of 
this proposal.<br>
<br>

 The STF proposal put forth by the 
College of Built Environments would provide students access to several 
technologies that are relevant to today's built environment. Tools such as the 
proposed laser measuring device allow us to learn from the world within which 
we live. Gaining a better understanding of how spaces and volumes function 
allows us as designers to not only evaluate the existing but to design better 
for the future. Certain geometries that are being explored in the design realm 
require the repeatable and accurate shaping of materials. Tools such as wire 
benders, fabric cutters, and a programmable stop gauge would help to fulfill 
the need for accurate material shaping in media that we cannot currently 
accurately control. The addition of these tools into the CBE shop will provide 
a significant increase in design possibilities to be explored by students.<br>

 Although I am no 
longer a student, having just graduated, I am still employed in the Gould shop 
by the college, and spent a lot of time there when I was a student. My 
experience in the shop includes taking furniture studio, doing an independent 
study in metalworking, and helping fabricate new display systems for the 
college.<br>
<br>
 The capabilities of our shop and the focus on design/build 
that it helps foster are a major part of why I chose UW for my Master's degree. 
Over the course of my 3 years in the program I saw the tradition of fine craft 
here begin to interact with the new computer-controlled production tools. I 
would have loved to have access to the tools in this proposal to get experience 
with these types of fabrication (wire bending, fabric cutting). For example, my 
own furniture studio project was a mixture of hand-bended wire and 
computer-shaped wood. It would have been a great learning experience to be able 
to &quot;reverse&quot; the project and understand how to make it using 
computer-controlled wire bending and hand-shaping the wood.<br>
<br>
 Learning 
to use tools that are used in real production work is also a major asset after 
graduating!<br>

 I'm writing in support of the Digital 
Fabrication Equipment funding proposal. The digital equipment that has already 
been introduced to the CBE shops in the last two years has allowed students to 
try new techniques that would have otherwise been unreachable for us, and 
expanding the equipment options will help us even more. I think that the 
proposal would provide even more assets to a shop that's already heading in a 
great direction.<br>

1 $5,500.00 <br>

<p> Location: Gould Hall - 132D </p> 
<p> Description: Controller and software for Huestis Industrial Bendmaster II 
wire bender.</p> 
<p> Justification: We have obtained the donation of a CNC wire bender (Huestis 
Industrial Bendmaster II, .059&quot; - 1.25&quot; capacity, ferrous and 
non-ferrous tubes, wires, bars). But we need to provide a CNC controller and 
associated software for it. These are available from Numalliance/MacSoft.<br>

<br> </p> <br>
Automatic Stop/Gauge and Pusher System other $5,295.00 1 
$5,295.00 <br>

<p> Location: Gould Hall - 132 </p> 
<p> Description: TigerStop TS10 automatic stop/gauge and pusher system, 
10-foot capacity</p> 
<p> Justification: This device provides precise, repeatable linear material 
positioning for production work. Students would be able to program the unit 
with the lengths of component pieces of their project, then have the device 
position material for cutting. Such devices are widely used in industry to 
efficiently produce sets of identical building parts; a deep understanding of 
their integration into the production process would help students be more 
effective both in the shops and in situations like internships in the field.</p>
<br> Laser Distance Meter other $799.00 1 $799.00 <br>

<p> Location: Gould Hall - 132 </p>

<p> Justification: Tool for high-precision angle and distance measurements. 
Would allow students to make field measurements of buildings and building 
components that are effectively impossible with non-laser methods. Its 
measuring range and accuracy (up to 650 feet with 0.04-inch accuracy) would 
allow students to collect data for direct import into the digital realm, so 
they could (for example) incorporate real-world data into the AutoCAD design of 
an addition to an existing building.</p> <br>
