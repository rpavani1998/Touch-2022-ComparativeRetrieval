<p>Sneaker News readers voted the Nike Air Yeezy 2 as the most anticipated 
sneaker release of 2012 in our year-endSneaker News Reader&rsquo;s Choice Poll, 
beating out the two blockbuster Air Jordan Retros by significant margins. That 
notion still remains, but it&rsquo;s becoming a difficult task to track the 
progress of the Air Yeezy 2 with Nike keeping such a tight lid on the project. 
This past Friday, Sneaker News was provided some informationregarding a third 
colorway of the Nike Air Yeezy 2, but it appears that for now, just two 
colorways will release &ndash; theBlack/Solar Red, which has been on 
Kanye&rsquo;s feet over the last few months, and theWolf Grey/Pure Platinum, 
commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Zen Grey&rsquo;. Another significant piece 
of information is that the rumored release of March 23rd is looking to be 
unlikely, with the release rumored to be pushed back to a later date (but not 
far after). If you want the most up-to-date information regarding the Nike Air 
Yeezy 2 release, you know where to keep in tuned, so let us know which of the 
two confirmed colorways you&rsquo;d prefer to have, and stick with Sneaker News 
for more updates. Many thanks to Jack for the info.</p>

<p>i like the black and pink ones! hopefully all the bum ass resellers get 
into some freak accident so they won't ruin the chance for the actually people 
who wants to wear them!</p> </li>

<p>Soooo tired of the yeezy 2 hype. The first yeezy's looked better and not by 
that much. Hypekills</p> </li> 
<li> @_PAAKKAA Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 12:39 pm 
<p>It's a clean sneaker, gold tip laces and very casual. Would these sneakers 
be over hyped ? Of course but then again its worth the buy if you like Supra's 
and things like that.</p> </li>

<p>If they were smart, they'd just make it a GR for a short time and be done 
with it. Don't retro it ever. People are going to get killed if this is a QS</p>

<p>So this was juat an update for an update. -___-</p> </li> 
<li> @TENDEROCK Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 1:45 pm 
<p>Pushed the release date back, again. Or maybe its already set, But NIKE 
keeps &quot;pushing it back&quot; so there is more talk/commotion on the 
sneakers which makes more HYPE! Im going to buy what I like so the HYPE doesn't 
bother me.</p> 
<p>People get upset when they aren't able to get a pair of kicks that are 
highly sought after or hyped up! Blame the game on &quot;hypebeast&quot; &amp; 
Resellers. When its really not their fault. Blame yourself, for knowing that 
the shoe is QS or hard to get, Knowing that people are going to be camped out, 
&amp; knowing that there are Resellers&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>well what i meant to say actually was that, I actually saw these on cnn. I 
saw these same shoes on a site for like 89.99 and I will be copping them 
QUICK!!! and CHEAP!!</p> </li> 
<li> John K. Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 1:51 pm 
<p>The news is that the rumored date of March is no longer true.</p> </li> 
<li> Hype kills Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 1:51 pm 
<p>but it doesnt matter to me because i cant afford these no way. Anything 
over 5$ is too much for my budget!</p> </li> 
<li> ****Big Infinite*** Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 1:52 pm 
<p>LETS HYPE THESE UP PEOPLE!!!! ESPECIALLY FOR THE RESELLERS!!!!</p> </li> 
<li> theREALstigz Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 1:52 pm 
<p>ima have to really work daddy to get these! Believe dat! &lt;- birdman 
voice!!!</p> </li> 
<li> @AuDeBlu Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:09 pm 
<p>I'll have no chance at getting these&hellip;.. Resellers are camping out 
right now!! LOL</p> </li> 
<li> Ell Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:14 pm 
<p>I like both of em but I'm not camping out for a week to snag em so unless 
they are a gr (which I know there not) no use in even getting hyped about these 
IMO</p> </li> 
<li> big50mike Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:17 pm 
<p>the zen gray's look hard but im not gonna camp a whole week for this 
craps&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p> </li>

<li> LovroJ Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:23 pm 
<p>Didn't cop the first ones, not gunna cop these either, but in my opinion i 
think these look better&hellip;. but thats just me.</p> </li> 
<li> PrestoneFuego Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:26 pm 
<p>I agree. If it isn't a GR, there WILL be a loss of life over these. I can 
almost guarantee it. Just because people are going to be looking to make a 
quick buck&hellip; Hell, it might happen if it IS a GR. Terrible.</p> </li> 
<li> FscottJ54 Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:34 pm 
<p>2 just 2 WTF what happen to 5 man this is just gonna make things more out 
of hand I really hope if they only doing 2 they make a good amount still 
limited but enough for most to cop</p> </li> 
<li> They're okay Says: <br>
March 5th, 2012 at 2:39 pm

<p>Damn they both look nice, i wouldn't want to resell them but at same time 
thats alot of money in your pocket if you get the chance to.</p> </li>

<p>Yeah the blk/pink pair looks crazy sick IMO and idk why people keep saying 
the yeezy 1's ARE WAY better because no dip they are its hard 2 make a shoe as 
good as the original</p> </li>

March 5th, 2012 at 5:11 pm 
<p>i remember wen they first showed pictures of these last year, everyone was 
commenting how much they hated them and that they looked ugly as hell. Now as 
the release date approaches, everyones saying how nice they are&hellip;. i 
guess hype does that to people&hellip;<br>
 to me they look alrite, i just 
don't like how the upper and the toe box look with the all mesh. The heel and 
ankle of the shoes look pretty fresh tho</p> </li>
