<h2>[edit] Corporate History</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Gebr&uuml;der Dassler Schuhfabrik</h3> 
<p>Christoph von Wilhelm Dassler was a worker in a shoe factory, while his 
wife Pauline ran a small laundry in theBavarian town of Herzogenaurach, 
20&nbsp;km (12.4&nbsp;mi) from the city ofNuremberg. After leaving school, 
their son,Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Dassler, joined his father at the shoe 
factory. When he returned from fighting inWorld War I, Rudolf received a 
management position at aporcelain factory, and later in a leather wholesale 
business inNuremberg.</p> <br>
 A pair of Adidas <i>Samba</i> football trainers.
<p>Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler started to produce his own sports shoes in 
his mother's wash kitchen inHerzogenaurach, Bavaria after his return from World 
War I. In July 1924, his brother Rudolf returned to Herzogenaurach to join his 
younger brother's business, which became<i>Gebr&uuml;der Dassler Schuhfabrik</i>
 (<i>Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory</i>) and prospered. The pair started the 
venture in their mother's laundry,[6]:5 but, at the time, electricity supplies 
in the town were unreliable, and the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power 
from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.[7]</p> 
<p>By the 1936 Summer Olympics, Adi Dassler drove from Bavaria on one of the 
world's first motorways to the Olympic village with a suitcase full of spikes 
and persuaded U.S.sprinter Jesse Owens to use them, the first sponsorship for 
an African American. Following Owens's haul of four gold medals, his success 
cemented the good reputation of Dassler shoes among the world's most famous 
sportsmen. Letters from around the world landed on the brothers' desks, and the 
trainers of other national teams were all interested in their shoes. Business 
boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes each year before 
World War II.[8]</p> 
<h3>[edit] Company split</h3> 
<p>Both brothers joined the Nazi Party, but Rudolf was slightly closer to the 
party than Adolf. During the war, a growing rift between the pair reached a 
breaking point after an Allied bomb attack in 1943, when Adi and his wife 
climbed into a bomb shelter that Rudolf and his family were already in: 
&quot;The dirty bastards are back again&quot;, Adi said, referring to the 
Allied war planes, but Rudolf was convinced his brother meant him and his 
family.[9] After Rudolf was later picked up by American soldiers and accused of 
being a member of theWaffen SS, he was convinced that his brother had turned 
him in.[7]</p> 
<p>The brothers split up in 1947,[10] with</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Rudi forming a new firm that he called <b>Ruda</b> &ndash; from <b>Ru</b>
dolf<b>Da</b>ssler, later rebranded Puma, and</li> 
<li>Adi forming a company formally registered as <b>Adidas AG</b> from <b>Adi
</b> <b>Das</b>sler on 18 August 1949. Although it is popularly claimed that 
the name is anacronym for <i>All Day I Dream About Sport</i>, that phrase is a 
backronym; the name is actually a portmanteau formed from &quot;Adi&quot; (a 
nickname for Adolf) and &quot;Das&quot; (from &quot;Dassler&quot;).[1]</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>[edit] Early years and rivalry with Puma</h3> 
<p>Puma and Adidas entered a fierce and bitter rivalry after the split. The 
town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue, leading to the nickname 
&quot;the town of bent necks&quot;&mdash;people looked down to see which shoes 
strangers wore.[11] Even the town's two football clubs were divided: ASV 
Herzogenaurach club supported Adidas, while 1 FC Herzogenaurach endorsed 
Rudolf's footwear.[7] When handymen were called to Rudolf's home, they would 
deliberately wear Adidas shoes. Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement 
and pick out a pair of free Pumas.[7] The two brothers never reconciled, and 
although both are buried in the same cemetery, they are spaced apart as far as 
possible.</p> 
<p>In 1948, the first football match after World War II, several members of the
West German national football team wore Puma boots, including the scorer of 
West Germany's first post-war goal,Herbert Burdenski. Four years later, at the 
1952 Summer Olympics, 1500 metres runner Josy Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma's 
first Olympic gold inHelsinki, Finland.</p> 
<p>At the 1960 Summer Olympics Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to wear 
Pumas in the 100 metre sprint final. Hary had worn Adidas before and asked 
Adolf for payment, but Adidas rejected this request. The German won gold in 
Pumas, but then laced up Adidas for the medals ceremony, to the shock of the 
two Dassler brothers. Hary hoped to cash in from both, but Adi was so enraged 
he banned the Olympic champion.[8]</p>

<i>(October 2010)</i> <br>
<br>

<p>After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler's son Horst 
Dassler in 1987, the company was bought in 1989 by French industrialist Bernard 
Tapie, for &#8355;1.6 billion (now &euro;243.9&nbsp;million), which Tapie 
borrowed. Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt 
companies, an expertise on which he built his fortune.</p> 
<p>Tapie decided to move production offshore to Asia. He also hired Madonna 
for promotion. He sent, fromChristchurch, New Zealand, a shoe sales 
representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler's descendants (Amelia Randall 
Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with a few items to promote 
the company there.</p> 
<p>In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated the Cr&eacute;dit 
Lyonnais bank to sell Adidas, and the bank subsequently converted the 
outstanding debt owed intoequity of the enterprise, which was unusual as per 
the prevalent French banking practice. Thestate-owned bank had tried to get 
Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie, it is 
reported, because Tapie wasMinister of Urban Affairs (ministre de la Ville) in 
the French government at the time.</p> 
<p>In February 1993, Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Robert Louis-Dreyfus
, a friend of Bernard Tapie for a much higher amount of money than what Tapie 
owed, 4.485&nbsp;billion (&euro;683.514&nbsp;million) francs rather than 
2.85&nbsp;billion (&euro;434.479&nbsp;million).</p> 
<p>Robert Louis-Dreyfus became the new CEO of the company. He was also the 
president ofOlympique de Marseille, a team Tapie had owned until 1993.[<i>

<p>Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994. He was the object of several 
lawsuits, notably related tomatch fixing at the football club. During 1997, he 
served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence inLa Sant&eacute; prison in 
Paris.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Post&mdash;Tapie era</h3> <br>

company's distinctivethree parallel bars <br>

<p>In 1994, combined with FIFA Youth Group, SOS Children's Villages became the 
main beneficiary.</p> 
<p>In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the Salomon Group who specialized in ski wear, 
and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG because with 
this acquisition Adidas also acquired the Taylormade Golf company andMaxfli, 
which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf.</p> 
<p>In 1998, Adidas sued the NCAA over their rules limiting the size and number 
of commercial logos on team uniforms and apparel. Adidas withdrew the suit, and 
the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be 
considered uses of the Adidas trademark.</p> 
<p>In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness 
World Trading's use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas's three stripes. 
The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark,<i>Fitness World</i> 's 
use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use 
and Adidas's mark.[12]</p> 
<p>In September 2004, top English fashion designer Stella McCartney launched a 
joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the 
corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for women called 
&quot;Adidas by Stella McCartney&quot;,[13] and it has been critically 
acclaimed.[14]</p> 
<p>Also in 2005, on 3 May, Adidas told the public that they sold their partner 
companySalomon Group for &euro;485m to Amer Sports of Finland. In August 2005, 
Adidas declared its intention to buy British rivalReebok for $3.8&nbsp;billion 
(US$). This takeover was completed with partnership in January 2006[1] and 
meant that the company would have business sales closer to those of Nike in 
North America. The acquisition of Reebok would also allow Adidas to compete with
Nike worldwide as the number two athletic shoemaker in the world.[15]</p> 
<p>Adidas has global corporate headquarters in Germany, and many other 
business locations around the world such as Portland OR, Hong Kong, Toronto, 
Taiwan, England, Japan, Australia, and Spain. Mainly sold in the U.S., Adidas 
makes lots of assets from these countries and is expanding to more oversea 
countries.</p> 
<p>In 2005, Adidas introduced the Adidas 1, the first ever production shoe to 
use amicroprocessor. Dubbed by the company &quot;The World's First Intelligent 
Shoe&quot;, it features a microprocessor capable of performing 5 million 
calculations per second that automatically adjusts the shoe's level of 
cushioning to suit its environment. The shoe requires a small, user-replaceable 
battery that lasts for approximately 100 hours of running. On 25 November 2005, 
Adidas released a new version of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of 
cushioning, allowing the shoe to become softer or firmer, and a new motor with 
153 percent more torque.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p> 
<p>On 11 April 2006, Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official 
NBA apparel provider. They will make NBA, NBDL, and WNBA jerseys and products 
as well as team-coloured versions of the &quot;Superstar&quot; basketball shoe. 
This deal (worth over $400&nbsp;million) takes the place of the previous 
10-year Reebok deal that was put in place in 2001.</p>

<h3>[edit] Running</h3> <br>

<p>Adidas currently manufactures several running shoes, including the adiStar 
Salvation 3, the adiStar Ride 3 (the replacement for the adiStar Cushion 6), 
the Supernova Sequence 4 (the replacement for the Supernova Control 10), and 
the Supernova Glide 3, among others. In addition, their performance apparel is 
widely used by runners. Adidas also uses kangaroo leather to make their more 
expensive shoes.[16][17]</p> 
<h3>[edit] Football</h3> 
<p>One of the main focuses of Adidas is football kit and associated equipment. 
Adidas remain a major company in the supply of team kits for international 
football teams.</p> 
<p>Adidas also makes referee kits that are used in international competition 
and by many countries and leagues in the world. The company has been an 
innovator in the area of footwear for the sport, with notable examples 
including the 1979 release of theCopa Mundial moulded boot used for matches on 
firm dry pitches. It holds the accolade of the best selling boot of all time. 
The soft-ground equivalent was named World Cup and it too remains on the 
market, timeless and iconic. Some of the most famous football teams are 
currently sponsored by Adidas.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p> 
<p>Adidas became renowned for advancing the Predator boot design developed by 
ex-Liverpool and Australian international playerCraig Johnston. This design 
featured a ribbed rubber structure for the upper leather of the shoe, used to 
accent the movement of the ball when struck; highly skilled players claimed 
they were able to curve the flight of the ball more easily when wearing this 
new contoured design.[<i>citation needed</i>] The Predator also features the 
Craig Johnston-invented Traxion sole.</p> 
<p>FIFA, the world governing body of football, commissioned specially designed 
footballs for use in its ownWorld Cup tournaments to favour more attacking 
play. The balls supplied for the2006 World Cup, the <i>Teamgeist</i>, were 
particular noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types 
when struck, leading to longer range goal strikes that were intended to 
increase the number of goals scored.[<i>citation needed</i>] Goalkeepers were 
believed to be less comfortable with the design, claiming it would move 
significantly and unpredictably in flight.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p> 
<p>Adidas also introduced another new ball for the 2010 World Cup. The Jabulani
 ball was designed and developed byLoughborough University in conjunction with 
Chelsea FC. It received much criticism from players, managers and pundits for 
being too hard to control.[<i>citation needed</i>] The lighter and more 
aerodynamic ball led to many shots and passes being over hit. The Jabulani was 
widely blamed for the low numbers of long range goals or even remotely accurate 
attempts in the opening stage of the tournament.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p> 
<p>As well as the aforementioned Predator boot, Adidas also manufacture the F50
 andadiPure range of football boots.<br>
 Adidas also provides apparel and 
equipment for all teams inMajor League Soccer.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Tennis</h3> <br>
 Professional tennis player Andy Murray. <br>

<p>Adidas has sponsored tennis players and recently introduced a new line of 
tennisracquets. While the Feather is made for the &quot;regular player&quot;, 
and the Response for the &quot;club player&quot;, Adidas targets the 
&quot;tournament player&quot; with the 12.2 oz Barricade tour model.[18] Adidas

highest paid star with a 5 year contract reported to be worth $24.5m.[20]</p> 
<p>Players sponsored by Adidas can take advantage of the Adidas Player

 Main article: List of Adidas sponsorships <br>

<p>Adidas is a major domestic (within Germany) and international sports and 
eventssponsor. During the last number of years, the Group has increased its

<h2>[edit] Criticism</h2> 
<p>As with the majority of prolific brand-based transnationals, Adidas's 
business practises/ethics and commitment to worker welfare have been 
scrutinised and often criticised.[43][44]</p> 
<h3>[edit] 2011 All Blacks replica rugby jersey pricing controversy</h3> 
<p>Unhappy with the local price of the Adidas replica All Blacks jersey, New 
Zealand-basedAll Blacks fans have asked for price cuts and begun purchasing the 
jersey from overseas vendors after it was revealed that the local price of 
$NZ220 was more than twice the price offered on some websites.[45]</p> 
<p>Adidas has responded by enforcing cross-border agreements to stop overseas 
retailers from selling to New Zealand residents. It has been labelled a public 
relations disaster by leading New Zealand PR firms and Consumer advocate 
groups. The largest New Zealand sportswear retailerRebel Sport has stated it is 
angry and is considering selling the All Blacks Jerseys to the general public 
below cost. As of August 9, 2011, Rebel Sport has decided not to stock the 
Adidas Rugby Union Jumper.[46]</p> 
<h3>[edit] Sweatshops and Labor Rights Violations</h3> 
<p>Adidas has been criticized for operating sweatshops, particularly in 
Indonesia. Between 2006 and 2007, Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that 
supported unions for subcontractors with less reputable labor rights records.[47
] By subcontracting work to different suppliers, it is more difficult for 
Adidas to ensure company labor standards are enforced. Workplace standards that 
Adidas' policy upholds include the freedom for workers to take part in
collective bargaining and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express 
concerns.[48] In practice, however, many of Adidas' suppliers have not upheld 
these standards. At the Panarub factory inJava, 33 workers were fired after 
striking for better pay in 2005.[49] PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory 
where Adidas has received criticism over treatment of workers. They produced 
products for Adidas as well asNike and the Dallas Cowboys until they closed 
recently in January 2011. 2,686 workers were laid off and are owed $3 million 
in severance pay and benefits. Nike has contributed $1.5 million but Adidas has 
not acted. A campaign has been initiated byUnited Students Against Sweatshops 
calling for universities to cut contracts with Adidas.[50]</p>
