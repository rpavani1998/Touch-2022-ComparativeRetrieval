<h2>The Age Long Battle</h2> 
<p>Over the past 60 years, the struggle for the number one tennis shoe has 
raged between two industrial giants, Nike and Adidas. &Acirc;&nbsp;Some argue 
that Nike tennis shoes are the best, while others say that Adidas are the 
future of tennis shoes. &Acirc;&nbsp;The purpose of this hub is&Acirc;&nbsp;
<strong>not</strong><strong>&Acirc;&nbsp;</strong>to persuade you toward either 
brand, but to help make your own decision about which shoe is better.</p> 
<p>The traits that will be examined in order to make deciding easier are:</p>

durability&Acirc;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Bios - Adidas</strong></p> 
<p>Founded in 1924 by Adolf Dassler (1900-1959), at the age of 20, invented 
the first pair of shoes with spikes. &Acirc;&nbsp;Today known as cleats, this 
innovation soon became world renowned for its impressive traction and 
durability. &Acirc;&nbsp;With more than 700 patents on new sports equipment and 
shoes before his death in 1959, Adidas was able to maintain its number one spot 
until just recently, with Nike in first place.</p> 
<p><strong>Bios - Nike</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<p>The current leading supplier of all shoes and apparel, Nike was founded in 
1964 under the name Blue Ribbon Sports. &Acirc;&nbsp;Eventually changed to Nike 
in 1974, the reason for Nike's great success in the shoe industry is due to its 
original designs and shoe soles. &Acirc;&nbsp;Producing its first innovative 
and original design in 1974, called the Waffle Trainer, the company soon 
thereafter took the sport apparel industry by storm.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nike - Just Do It</h2> 
<p>The powerhouse of athletic goods, Nike holds range over everything from 
shirts and shorts to watches and weights.</p> 
<p>Because of this monopoly on the sporting industry, Nike has allowed itself 
enough room to expand its design.</p> 
<p>Common traits among Nike shoes related to <strong>design</strong> are that 
they are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Flashy</li> 
<li>Bold</li> 
<li>Consistently Endorsed by Professionals and</li> 
<li>are constantly upgrading technology</li> </ul> 
<p>For example, in the last line of Nike shoes (the Nadal Air series), the 
apparel featured strong contrasting colors, small dots for breathability and 
lunarlite technology (will be explained in the comfort section).</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The next section, <strong>Comfort</strong>, is one of the more contested 
areas with Adidas. But don't take my word for it, judge for yourself.</p> 
<p>Described as stiff and rigid, Nike claims that their toe section is 
stronger for better stability and traction on the court. As an owner of a pair 
of Courtballistec Nike shoes, I can vouch for this stiffness. Despite this 
fact, the small dots covering the exterior of the shoe do allow for greater 
movement and flexibility.</p> 
<p>Another factor dealing with the comfort of the new Nike line is that of 
lunarlite technology. This addition to the shoe, a lighter and more reactive 
foam, allows for greater spring in the step while also allowing for greater 
impact force when stepping down.</p> 
<p>Aside from these two traits, Nike shoes, as opposed to that of Adidas, have 
a much more comfortable interior. With slipper-likeness to the beginning of the 
shoe, the foot feels much less constrained and overall more comfortable.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The last trait of the Nike shoes to be examined is that of <strong>endurance
</strong>. This seems to be the only area that Nike lacks in. </p> 
<p>As a competitive tennis player, I constantly go through shoes every 2-3 
weeks, and I have found that Nike shoes tend to last me at most 2 weeks. The 
reason for this is partially because they are so light, and also because so 
little rubber is used to support the ball area of the foot.</p> 
<p>Also, in terms of shoe laces, Nike shoe laces are actually very strong. 
Because I prefer my shoes to be tied firmly and tight, I constantly am going 
through shoe laces. Due to Nike's strong shoe laces, I constantly find myself 
replacing all of my broken laces with Nike string.</p>

<p>Overall Rating: 7/10</p> 
<h2>Evolution of the Adidas Barricade Tennis Shoe</h2> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Adidas - Impossible is Nothing</h2> 
<p>The constant theme that I have noticed throughout the history of Adidas's 
tennis shoe lines is the phrase, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; 
As you can see, based on the pictures to the right, the same design has lasted 
through 5 different series of Adidas shoes.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong></p> 
<p>Still, throughout my tennis career, I have continued to come back to 
Adidas's tennis shoes for one reason, and one reason alone: durability.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned before, I constantly go through tennis shoes because of my 
regular tennis schedule. In my experience, playing close to 1-2 hours everyday 
(including sprinting, sliding and stopping), I have found that Adidas tennis 
shoes can last at minimum 2 weeks. (The longest these shoes have ever lasted is 
2.5 weeks.)</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Design</strong>, as mentioned above, is not a huge factor in the 
Adidas company. Holding, basically, the same design for the last 4 models of 
the Barricade shoe, it is easy to see why Nike, with all of its color and 
flair, is a much more attractive shoe. What is important about the Barricades 
though, is that movement is an extreme emphasis. From the shots of the bottom 
of the shoes, it is easy to see the circular pattern at the point of the ball 
of the toe. While this might seem insignificant to any recreational player, all 
competitive players know that this contributes greatly to a player's ability to 
turn and push in any direction. Not found anywhere in the Nike designs, this 
checks off as one of the few distinct and positive design traits.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The final category, <strong>comfort</strong>, tends to be a medium strength 
for the shoe. While not the same as the slipper-like feel of Nike's tennis 
shoes, the soles of Adidas shoes conform well to the shape of the foot very 
quickly, and don't put too much pressure on the toes.</p> 
<p>One factor of the shoe that must be brought to attention is the weight of 
the Barricade lines. The reason that these shoes last so long is due to 
additional rubber on the shoe. Because of this, Adidas can often feel heavy to 
the user, but with practice, this feeling goes away.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Overall Rating: 7.5/10</p> 
<h2>How did Adidas Win?</h2> 
<p>The reason that I believe Adidas to be the better shoe is because, from the 
perspective of a competitive player, while bold colors and new shoe technology 
are great, they don't win matches. When I look to buy shoes, I specifically 
target two things: endurance and traction. Because of the Barricade's weight, I 
can easily maneuver around the court. While some might argue that because Nikes 
are lighter this makes movement much better, I have found that once the shoes 
wear out (which happens quite often), I slide around the court unable to 
control the valuable seconds of time I need to get to the next shot.</p> 
<p><strong>The Factor of Price: One final reason why Adidas won out is 
because, typically, Nike shoes are much more expensive.</strong></p> adidas

<p>MBT shoes (Masai Barefoot Technology) was born in 1996 when we discovered 
that natural instability has some amazing health benefits. We made this 
discovery by observing the wonderfully agile Masai people walking barefoot on 
natural, uneven ground. Seeing these people in action made us realize that the 
human body is simply not designed to walk or stand on the hard, flat surfaces 
of modern society. So we set out to develop a new kind of footwear, one that 
would mimic walking on soft, uneven ground. The results have been dramatic and 
revolutionary. MBTs are now sold in more than 35 countries around the world and 
enthusiastic users testify that wearing MBTs noticeably increase their 
well-being.mbt shoes sale?mbt outlet?mbt sneakers</p> <br>
