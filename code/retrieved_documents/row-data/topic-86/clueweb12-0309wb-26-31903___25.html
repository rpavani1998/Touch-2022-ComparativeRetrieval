<h4> <b>Abstract</b> </h4> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In this essay I look behind the mask of &quot;free&quot; global trade 
presented by Nike Corporate Leadership. Behind this mask, I see the Nietzschean 
Superman, with a will to power that is not talked about in contemporary 
leadership theory. Contemporary leader theory does not mention 
&quot;sweatshops,&quot; is too politely bureaucratic, preferring transactional 
and routinized transformational leaderly study to that of the less moral 
Supermen and Machiavellian Princes. The contribution of this essay is to 
present a look at leadership that is not polite, humble, or quite so moral and 
pure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I develop a three dimensional model of leadership across nine 
types of networks. The first dimension I call &quot;X&quot; the transactional 
to transformational moral ground of traditional leadership study. The second 
dimension I call &quot;Y&quot; extending from the will to serve to the 
Nietzschean will to Power. And the third dimension &quot;Z&quot; extends from 
the narrative homogeneity to narrative heterogeneity.&nbsp; As a case example, 
I look at the nine networks of involvement of the Nike Corporation in (1) 
supply chains, (2) distribution webs, (3) postmodern cultural icons (Woods, 
Jordan, and stars like Gibson &amp; Hunt), (4) transgovernment relations (among 
1st &amp; 3rd world governments), (5) education, (6) Nike is the leader of a 
pack of competitors, (7) investors and consumers (who purchase stocks and 
products), (8) workers (in Beaverton, Oregon, expatriates, and 3rd World mostly 
young females, and (9) the postmodern network of resistors to the leadership of 
Nike in the global stage of postmodern capitalism.&nbsp;</p>

<h4> Introduction </h4> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did my dissertation on the centrality of organizations 
and leaders in various interorganizational networks, such as communication, 
resource, and reputation (Boje, 1979a).Along with David Whetten, we posited 
that leadership takes place in an interorganizational field of strategies and 
environmental constraints (Boje, 1979b,1999a; Boje &amp; Whetten, 1989; Boje, 
White &amp; Wolfe, 1994).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, I have looked at how change and 
transformation takes place in transorganizational networks (Boje &amp; Wolfe, 
1980). The field of transorganizational development theory and praxis was first 
appraised in a seminal article by Culbert, Elden, McWhinney, Schmidt, &amp; Bob 
Tannenbaum (1972). For a more recent review, see theTransorganizational 
Development Web Site).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this paper is to extend the field of 
leadership from its current focus on leaders and worker transactions and 
organizational transformations to the interorganizational field of network 
study. The field of leadership has not strayed from from the trait study of 
great leaders, the dyadic behavioral relations between leaders and followers, 
and the recent interest in differentiating between transactional and 
transformational (even charismatic) leaders. The purpose of this essay is to 
explore the kinds of leadership enacted in Nike-Beaverton, its subcontractors, 
and distribution chain. I will suggest that Phil Knight is part Machiavellian 
Prince, part Nietzschean superman and part Weberian charismatic hero as well as 
Bureaucratic executive. In the second part of the essay, I will look at ways 
Nike Corporation could transform its supply chain of feudalistic sweatshops 
into what Dominique Besson (2000) calls, &quot;French Taylorism.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to make several related contributions to 
leadership. First, to focus on nine types of global networks in which 
leadership takes place. Using the Nike Corporation as a case example, these 
range from&nbsp; (1) supply chains of Third World factories, (2) distribution 
webs of outlets (from NikeTown to Footlocker), (3) postmodern cultural icons 
(Woods, Jordan, and stars like Gibson &amp; Hunt), (4) transgovernment 
relations (among 1st &amp; 3rd world governments applying more or less legal 
codes), (5) education (programs to change student perceptions of Nike), (6) 
Nike is the leader of a pack of competitors, (7) investors and consumers (who 
purchase stocks and products), (8) workers (in Beaverton, Oregon, expatriates, 
and 3rd World mostly young females, and (9) the postmodern network of resistors 
to the leadership of Nike in the global stage of postmodern capitalism. Second, 
I wish to look here to elaborate an expanded and more integrative theory of 
moral and amoral reasoning (e.g. Kohlberg). Kohlberg (1964, 1966, 1969, 1976, 
1981 &amp; 1984) studied differences in children's reasoning about moral 
dilemmas. He hypothesized that moral difficulties motivated their development 
through a fixed sequence of increasingly flexible kinds of moral reasoning. See 
Boje (2000b) for a review of the relation of what I term &quot;narrative moral 
development&quot; to leadership theory. I propose to look at three dimensions 
of leadership in the athletic apparel industry that includes networks of 
designers, marketers, subcontractors, workers, celebrities, distributors, 
customers, investors, intellectuals, journals, governments, and protestors. My 
basis thesis is one can not properly understand the depth and scope of Nike 
leadership unless we understand its relations to the nine types of networks 
listed above. In my multi-dimensional view, there are three critical dimensions 
to Nike's transorganizational leadership. For simplicity, I will label them X, 
Y, and Z.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>X - Transactional to transformational leadership</b>, as studied by 
Burns (1978) and Bass (1985). </p> <br>

<p><b>Y - From the Will to Server to the Nietzschean Will to Power. The Will 
to Power</b> is specifically excluded from transaction and transformational 
leader theory by both Burns and Bass. I therefore treat it as a second 
dimension of leadership (SeeBoje, 2000b) for an overview.. </p> <br>

<p><b>Z - From monophonic (single voice) narrative to (polyphonic) narrative
</b>. I am interested in the Tamara (Boje, 1995) of storytelling behaviors of 
transorganizational leadership (Boje, 1999a).&nbsp; </p> <br>
<br>
</blockquote>
<p></p> 
<h1> PART I - Towards a Network Theory of Leadership </h1> 
<p>In Part I, I will review a three-dimensional model of network leadership. 
In Part II, I follow this up with specific recommendations to Nike Corporation.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>X - Dimension - </b>As an overview, James MacGregor 
Burns (1978) based his classic study of leadership on Kohlberg's levels of 
moral thinking to differentiate between transactional and transformational 
leadership (Dimension X). Burns looked at modal thinking (the means over ends 
reasoning) in the early stages of development and held these leaders to be 
&quot;transactional.&quot;&nbsp; Transactional leadership &quot;requires a 
shrewd eye for opportunity, a good hand at bargaining, persuading, 
reciprocating&quot; (Burns, 1978:169).&nbsp;A &quot;transformational 
leader,&quot; on the other hand, &quot;recognizes and exploits an existing need 
or demand of a potential follower... (and) looks for potential motives in 
followers, seeks to satisfy higher needs, and engages the full person of the 
follower&quot; (p. 4).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Y - Dimension - </b>The Y Dimension extends from Will 
to Serve (WTS) to Will to Power (WTP). Nietzsche's notebooks (1967) on Will to 
Power (WTP) were written from1883 to 1888. The transaction/ transformational 
leadership theorists reject the WTP bas being too immoral, merely a brutish 
self-indulgent or tyrannical power wielding that is immoral. But, a more 
careful reading of Nietzsche reveals quite a different approach to both 
leadership and the study of morals.&nbsp; The WTP for Nietzsche has something 
to do with the will to initiate and implement a goal as well as the more macro 
construct of Darwin's theory of natural section, the power to transform the 
inherited advantages from generation to generation (WTP #362). And WTP is also 
a Will to Truth (TSZ, pp. 28, 113). For Nietzsche the world revolves around the 
inventor of new social and cultural values (TSZ, p. 52). Nike is a Superman 
leader, extending its power from cultural transformation through celebrity and 
star power to the factories and sweatshops of the Third World nations. The WTP 
is a will to overcome the small people, &quot;they are the superman's greatest 
danger&quot; (TSZ, p. 287). And the superleader is not satisfied with the 
happiness of the greatest number of workers or consumers (TSZ, p. 287). The 
Super leaders sees the abyss with the eyes of an eagle and grasps the abyss of 
poverty and misery with the talons of an eagle (TSZ, p. 288).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Resituating the Transaction/Transformation Model of 
Leadership -&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; Figure One crosses the X and Y dimensions of 
transaction to transformation with WTS to WTP. The horizontal X dimension of 
transactional to transformational made famous in the work of James MacGregor 
Burns (1978) and Bernard M. Bass (1985); and the vertical Y dimension I am 
adding, extends from the will to serve others to the will to power of Friedrich 
Nietzsche (writing in the 1870s). Burns and Bass restrict leadership to the 
bureaucratic transactional and heroic/ charismatic approaches (cells 1 and 3) 
to a will to serve others. I would like to resituate leadership by including 
the work of Machiavelli and Nietzsche (cells 2 and 4). Burns, more than Bass, 
disqualifies leaders who wield power, including those with a strong &quot;will 
to power&quot; as well as tyrants and dictators who use power in what Burns and 
Bass see as amoral. In short, the contemporary transaction/ transformation 
duality restricts leadership moral uses of power, to the will to serve 
others.&nbsp; Bass sees the transactional leader as either opinion leader, 
group leader, party, legislative, or executive leader.&nbsp; In each case, the 
transaction leader &quot;requires a shrewd eye for opportunity, a good hand at 
bargaining, persuading, reciprocating&quot; (p. 169). The transactional leader 
approaches followers with an eye to exchanging one thing for another: jobs for 
votes, or subsidies for campaign contributions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> Figure One: The X &amp; Y Leader Dimensions </h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns' transformational leader can be an intellectual, 
reform, revolutionary, or (charismatic) hero. The transformational leader 
&quot;recognizes and exploits an existing need or demand of a potential 
follower... (and) looks for potential motives in followers, seeks to satisfy 
higher needs, and engages the full person of the follower&quot; (Burns, 1978: 
4).&nbsp; Few, if any, leadership theorists have noted the transactional 
aspects of Weber's (1947) model of the three leaderly authorities. Yet, what 
Weber theorized is quite consistent (though not identical) with the 
transactional theory of Burns (1978) and Bass (1985).&nbsp; All do recognize 
Weber's charismatic leaderly authority, but never seem to read the part about 
the routinization of charisma, or see how bureaucratic transaction and heroic 
charisma interact with the third category of authority, the traditional 
feudalistic enactment of the Sultan and Chief. Burns and Bass seem to accept a 
linear progress model of leaderly power and authority that suggests that 
transaction and transformation are beyond the feudalistic form.&nbsp; Yet, for 
Machiavelli's strategic advice to Prince, the types of power Burns finds 
amoral, and therefore outside his definition of leadership, is still, I think, 
very much in evidence today.&nbsp; And so is the Superman, the will to power of 
Nietzsche.&nbsp; Figure One, therefore is an effort to resituate the discussion 
of transactional and transformational leadership by adding a second, vertical 
dimension. To me the Princely leader is concerned about the means of power, and 
will sacrifice ends over means.&nbsp; However, the Superman or Superwoman 
leader is more transformational than transactional&nbsp; (For more on this 
topic please seeTransformational Leadership, Charismatic Leadership, and the 
Theatrics of Leadership study guides).&nbsp;</p> 
<h3> Phil Knight's Leader Styles<b>&nbsp;</b> </h3> 
<p>As an illustration, we can look just at Phil Knight's leadership style in 
terms of the dimensions and categories of Figure One.&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ol> 
<li> 
<p><b>Bureaucrat </b>- Phil Knight as executive director manages the 
transaction game, the rate setting of production and wage prices negotiated in 
contracts with some 700 subcontractors.&nbsp; In these transactions, the 
subcontracting factory owners (who are mostly Korean and Thai) are left little 
bargaining room to extend more than poverty wages to their workers.&nbsp;</p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Prince </b>- Phil Knight shrewdly manages the ad machine to enact a 
spectacle public image of himself and Nike corporate behavior.&nbsp;</p></li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Hero </b>- Within Nike, Phil Knight is a charismatic heroic figure, with 
the tattoo of the swoosh on his leg, something the distributor sales force, 
knows as EKINs emulates. But it is not Phil's charisma that sells shoes or the 
spectacle image of Nike to consumers and investors. In the postmodern era, the 
public worships heroes of consumption, not production. So Tiger Woods is the 
current spotlight hero of Nike, have supplanted the retired Michael Jordan. 
Jennings (196) observed the transition from production to consumption 
heroes.&nbsp;</p></li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Superman</b> - I do not think we can capture and define Phil Knight's 
leadership qualities and behaviors in the typical duality of transaction and 
transformational categories (See Figure One). Instead, I see Knight as 
exercising a will to power that is prerequisite to what Nietzsche calls the 
Superman leader.&nbsp; Nietzsche's Will to Power (hereafter WTP) notebooks were 
written between 1883 and 1888 (see Nietzsche, 1967). WTP had a mechanistic (WTP 
618) and Organic one (WTP).&nbsp; The mechanistic WTP includes the idea of 
&quot;every specify body strives to becomes master over all space and to extend 
its force (-its will to power:) and to thrust back all that resists its 
extension&quot; (WTP&nbsp; #636).&nbsp; In its organic form, Nietzsche 
describes it a s a will to life. The more mechanistic form is an expression of 
the calculability of the world in formulas of motion, cause, and effect, 
attraction and repulsion, as well as the separation of deed from doer (WTP 
#624-627, 631). Mechanistic WTP is more transactional, where as the organic one 
is more about transformation. In either case, WTP is &quot;an insatiable desire 
to manifest power&quot; and &quot;the exercise of power, as a creative 
drive&quot; and one that &quot;can manifest itself only against 
resistances&quot; (WTP, 619, 656).&nbsp; It is this sense of the will to power 
that I read in the texts and behavior of Phillip Knight. Knight is forming, 
shaping and reshaping his power domain in athletic apparel and in his narrating 
of his power domain. One could argue that Knight's WTP is mechanistic, about 
amassing quantities of money and market share by the mechanistic chaining of 
more and more Asian subcontract factories to distribution chains worldwide. 
Knight executes his strategies in an orchestrated campaign where the 
&quot;means&quot; are subordinated to a &quot;will.&quot;&nbsp; 
&quot;Willing&quot; for Nietzsche (WTP #668) is not &quot;desiring,&quot; 
striving,&quot; &quot;demanding&quot;: &quot;it is distinguished from these by 
the affect of commanding.&quot; It is a primitive form of affect, 
&quot;encroachment of one power upon another power&quot; (WTP #668, 689). The 
resistance that for Phil Knight and Nike must be continually overcome is the 
herds of journalists, intellectuals, and activists who trade web information 
and concoct sensational expos stories about Nike sovereignty. The danger of 
investor and consumer boycott and rebellion is kept at bay the will to power, 
the will to sustain the life of the Nike global empire. The Superman (or 
Superwoman) is &quot;lid by a faultless and severe instinct into doing nothing 
that disagrees with him, just as he eats nothing he does not enjoy:&quot; (WTP 
# 906). And this will to power is for Nietzsche an exceptional quality of the 
Superman leader that I see in Philip Knight, superior in will, knowledge 
riches, and influence to the Korean and Thai Princes and to the Sweaty workers, 
at least for now (WTP #804, 866, 960).&nbsp; Knight exercises his will, despite 
postmodern coalitions of resistance (wet artists, intrusive journalists, campus 
protest, WTO protest, and NikeTown protest, and shareholder meeting 
protests).&nbsp;</p></li> </ol> </blockquote> 
<p>Philip Knight is the Superman, who has ordered Nike to terminate promotion 
contracts with Brown, Michigan, and his own alma mater, the University of 
Oregon, withdrawing a pledge of $30 million for a sports stadium. </p> 
<p>Located at www.dogeatdogfilms.com&nbsp; -Michael Moore's World Wide Web 
site transcripts from his interview with Knight. Moore made the video out-takes 
available after he saw a misleading posting of selected clips on the Nike 
website earlier this week. The new footage shows the CEO justifying the use of 
14-year-old labor in his<br>
 overseas factories.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <br>
<br>

<p>But our purpose is not to assess Phil Knight, it is to look at the nine 
types of network relationships in which Knight's leadership is engaged. To do 
this requires we look to a third (Y) dimension of network leadership, the 
narrative voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3> <b>Z Narrative Dimension - </b>&nbsp;<b>From Monophonic (single voiced) 
to polyphonic (many voices).</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure Two adds a third dimension to what was displayed in 
Figure One. This is the Y dimension of monophonic to polyphonic narrative. The 
(blue) boxes in the lower potion of the figure on the monophonic narrative 
types, whereas, the upper (orange) ones represents the polyphonic 
ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h3> Figure Two: Leader in Three Dimensions </h3> 
<p>In bureaucratic leadership, for example, there is mostly monologue; other 
voices are there on the stage but forbidden to speak, or they can only be 
whispered, their words unhearable, drowned out by the one official narrator who 
is authorized to take center-stage and speak and speak some more. As Kirkeby 
(2000: 232) argues it is the right of power to narrate events, to declare them 
romantic, tragic, comedic, or ironic, and then of course make them all&nbsp; 
into a romantic narratives that fits the bureaucratic pension for monophonic 
(single voiced) influence. For any other voice to speak would be an act of 
bureaucratic espionage; certainly for the secretary to speak would be 
unthinkable rebellion. Barry and Elmes (1997) look at monophonic and polyphonic 
aspects of leadership strategy.&nbsp; See Boje (2000c) for more on the multiple 
voices of leadership.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The combination of the three dimensions (X, Y, &amp; Z) provides eight 
types of leadership. The first four are more monophonic than the last four (on 
Z narrative dimension).&nbsp;</p> 
<ol> 
<li> 
<p><b>Bureaucratic (X = Transactional; Y = Will to Serve; Z = Monophonic)</b>
</p></li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Heroic (X = Transformational; Y = Will to Serve; Z = Monophonic)</b></p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Prince (X = Transactional; Y = Will to Power; Z = Monophonic)</b></p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Super (X = Transformational; Y = Will to Power; Z = Monophonic)</b></p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Government (X = Transactional; Y = Will to Serve; Z = Polyphonic)</b></p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Intellectual/ Reform (X = Transformational; Y = Will to Serve; Z = 
Polyphonic)</b></p></li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Opinion (X = Transactional; Y = Will to Power; Z = Polyphonic)</b></p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p><b>Revolutionary (X = Transformational; Y = Will to Power; Z = Polyphonic)
</b></p></li> </ol> Nike's cover story is getting fiddled with more and more 
holes, with each revelatory story. This, in my opinion, is forcing Nike 
leadership to move from denial that sweatshops exist, to camouflage tactics 
where factories raided by activists and journalists are cleaned up, moved, or 
shut down (as in #2).&nbsp; However, here the risk takes on new intrigue. Nike 
is flirting with the idea of implementing OSHA safety and health standards, ISO 
9000, and even ISO 14000 standards. Yet, Nike has its heels dug in and will not 
be paying living wages, even though it pays Tiger Woods $100 million in 
endorsement contracts. In 1998, even Nike chief executive Phil Knight conceded 
that &quot;the Nike product has become synonymous with slave wages, forced 
overtime, and arbitrary abuse.&quot; (Standing up to the swoosh&nbsp;<br>
 The 
Village Voice; New York; Oct 10, 2000; Andrew Hsiao; Vol. 45 Issue: 40, Page: 
41-43). <br>
&quot;There may appear to be little common ground linking concerns 
about China trade policy, student activism, university athletics, and sweatshop 
labor. But the Nike sportswear contracts have provided the glue that has 
cemented them, like sneakers, firmly together&quot;&nbsp;<br>

mean when Time Magazine gives Nike its worst innovation award&gt; In &quot;The 
best &amp; worst of 2000&quot; list of&nbsp; Time Magazine, Dec 18, 2000,

Protesters are 
everywhere, &quot;marching down Fifth Avenue to the Rockefeller<br>
 Christmas 
tree to protest Nike, Gap, Kohl's and Disney; or, up in Cambridge, walking 
through the Harvard administration building singing carols like &quot;Away in a 
Sweatshop.&quot; - Santa and Sweatshops&nbsp; Wall Street Journal; New York, 
N.Y.; Dec 22, 2000, A14.&nbsp; <br>
&quot;The well-known campaign against Nike, 
for example, has forced the company to promise significant changes in its 
employment practices, though few have yet been realized. When a recent 
cross-country &quot;Nike Truth Tour&quot; organized by students protested the 
firing of a worker at a Nike subcontractor in Honduras, the employer was forced 
to rehire her&quot; (Globalization from below&nbsp; The Nation; New York; Dec 
4, 2000; Jeremy Brecher; Tim Costello; Brendan Smith; Volume: 271Issue: 18: 
19-22). <br>
&quot;Take Nikomas Gemilang, a sprawling, 50-building minicity 
near Jakarta that employs 22,500 workers making shoes for Nike and Adidas. It 
is owned by Taiwan's Pou Chen Corp., the world's largest shoe manufacturer. At 
Nike's<br>
 urging, Nikomas set a higher wage scale for senior workers and 
ousted managers who had yelled abuses at workers. The factory also improved 
safety and food in company dorms, which house 13,000 workers... And workers' 
pay, even if it's better than average for that country, is still pitiful 
considering the nearly 40% gross profit margins Nike and Reebok 
earn&quot;&nbsp; (A World of Sweatshops - Business Week; New York; November 6, 
2000; Sub Title:&nbsp; Progress is slow in the drive for better conditions 
Edition:&nbsp;<br>
 Industrial/technology edition Issue:&nbsp; 3706 Page: 52). 
<br> Furthermore, the anti-sweatshop movement is far more widespread than the 
scholars seem to realize. Religious congregations throughout the United States 
are involved.. Labor unions are organizing exploited apparel workers of other 
countries, and of the United States. All across the country, a process of 
educating and mobilizing consumers in response to abuses by employers in the 
apparel industry is going on. .The scholars should stop pretending to be 
neutral and objective in a situation where people-especially women and young 
girls-are being exploited and are suffering so that excessive profits may 
continue to be generated by Nike and the corporations that indulge in similar 
practices.&nbsp; THE REV. PAUL SURLIS Associate Professor Emeritus of Moral

<h2> PART II - Extending the 3 Leader Dimensions to Nike's Nine Types of 
Network Relationships</h2> 
<p>The next part of the essay looks at the nine types of network leadership 
that Nike participates in.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(1) Supply chains of Third World factories </b>- Nike Corporation, its 
700 subcontractors and a 1,000 outlets form a global production and 
distribution supply chain. Nike is a $9 billion supply and distribution chain 
subcontracting and marketing 200 million pairs of sports shoes a 
year.&nbsp;&quot;Reebok, Nike, Liz Claiborne, and Mattel--have finally begun 
enforcing their<br>
 codes in the past year or two&quot; (Bernstein, 2000: 
86).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In terms of the dimensions of Figure Two, Nike's leadership in the 700 
subcontractor supply chain of factories is (X = Transactional; Y = Will to 
Power; &amp; Z = Monophonic). In terms of Will to Power, Nike has disclosed the 
locations of forty-one of its factories in eleven countries around the world, 
the rest are secret. In 1997 alone,&nbsp; Nike spent $978 million on marketing 
and advertising its corporate image and logo.&nbsp;The leaders of this supply 
chain act as if they really believe that feudal sweatshops are more productive, 
efficient, and profitable than modern management systems. The 700 
subcontractors in the supply chain are not all created equal. That is Thai and 
Korean conglomerates own many of the 700 factories, and to minimize the power 
of Nike on their actions, they also subcontract to Reebok, Adidas, Fila, Puma, 
and numerous other apparel marketers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> There are many feudal lords and princes in the Nike empire.&nbsp; These 
roles are played by the Korean and Thai factory owners who subcontract to Nike 
Corporation, in endless rounds of bargaining. The Machiavellian Princes have 
their own strategies and tactics fore resisting Nike's corporate power (Carty, 
1999).&nbsp;</p> 
<h2> The Subcontractor Sweatshop Shell Game </h2> 
<p>I remember seeing my first Shell Game on the streets of Manhattan. Several 
(usually two to four) actors collaborate with the shell game to take the 
tourist's money. Once you know this, it is actually rather easy to spot the 
accomplices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Take three shells and label them &quot;Global Alliance,&quot; &quot;Fair 
Labor Association&quot; and &quot;Price Waterhouse Coopers.&quot; Shells are a 
neat concept as they hide the &quot;sweatshop&quot; -- like the pea, something 
desired by labor organizers, student activists, and academic rebels..</p> 
<p>In the Nike Supply Chain Shell Game, subcontractors will move a sweatshop 
from location to location. Nike will bring in its accomplices, the FLA, GA or 
PWC to verify that there is no sweatshop.&nbsp; If a journalist or activist 
finds child labor, force overtime, unsafe conditions, Nike will demand that the 
subcontractor clean it up.&nbsp; Meanwhile Nike and its subcontractors open up 
new factory locations.&nbsp; Meanwhile Nike has a number of empty shells. That 
is, factory locations that rival the best factory conditions anywhere. But, the 
Shell Game is for the monitors to figure out if all 700 factory locations are 
up to such high standards.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The global supply chain is ridiculed in expos stories of spotting the 
sweatshop under the shell. The subcontractor invisibly moves the 
&quot;ball&quot; here, here, or there. &quot;Catch me if you can?&quot;&nbsp; 
This is facilitated by threatening workers who talk to monitors in suits or 
anyone who looks like a journalist or activist.&nbsp; The contracts are worth 
big bucks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Networks of activists and academic intellectuals are traveling to Asia to 
spot the Shell Game. They interview and observe Nike subcontract factories, and 
returning to the 1st world with stories of sweaty practices. Nike's strategy 
has been to (1) deny that sweatshops exist, (2) except when one is found to be 
unequivocally real, where upon Nike (a) cancels its contract if it is a 
weakling, (b) moves the factory production to an undisclosed new location, or 
(c) reengineers its practices if it is of moderate power, or (c) ignores it, 
while stating publicly that reform takes time, and Nike will hang in there 
until libratory change for the workforce happens. Meanwhile Nike Corporate in 
speeches and websites claims that its strategic game is transparent 
(Transparency 101), for all the world to see.&nbsp; Yet, Nike only will 
disclose the where about of about 40 of its 700 factory locations, claiming the 
strategic secrecy is necessary to sustain its competitive advantage. Meanwhile, 
activists and journalists and a few academics hunt the Asian world for factory 
locations like treasure hunters search for sunken ships. The credibility of the 
shell game is augmented by flashy consulting studies and a few well rehearsed 
factory tours by celebrities such as Andrew Young, MBA students (Tuck Business 
School), and a few sympathetic academics.</p> May 12, 1998 Phil Knight

Nike axes 'sweatshop' after BBC investigation&nbsp; 
Marketing; London; Oct 19, 2000; Tania Mason; Page: 5 &quot;Nike has pledged to 
pull out of the factory it uses in Cambodia and the Gap has suspended orders 
there, following Sunday's BBC Panorama program, which uncovered the use of 
child labor by both companies... June Textiles Co in Phnom Penh, which produces 
clothes for both brands. Hidden cameras smuggled inside showed children who 
appeared to be younger than 15 years old working on the shop floor, while other 
employees admitted working seven-day weeks. &quot; 2nd Source - ASIAWEEK: SIGNS 
OF THE TIMES Asiaweek; Hong Kong; Oct 9, 2000; &quot;Nike pulled out of the 
June Textiles sweatshop factory in Cambodia after discovering it used child 
labor. Undercover investigators filmed children sewing shirts for just a few 
cents a day.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Anita Roddick argues that instead of pulling 
out Nike should stay and face its responsibilities -&nbsp; &quot;Somehow, we 
have to persuade these retailers and the media on the rare occasions when they 
publicise the issue - that the right response is to take responsibility. That 
means sticking with the factory to sort out the abuses, sending the 
child-workers to school and paying them while they're there. If everybody 
washes their hands of the whole problem, we won't get anywhere&quot; (Diary,

<br>

<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>(2) Distribution webs of outlets (from NikeTown to Footlocker)</b> - 
There have been very few studies of the distribution contracting of Nike 
(Carty, 1999). Most of the attention is on the supply chain of Asian factories. 
The Nike storytelling machine (Boje 1991, 1995) is a narrative web spanning the 
1st World thirst for heroic sports worship&nbsp; and the 3rd world supply chain 
of sweat labor, as well as the global distribution transaction economy of 
distributors (NikeTown, Footlocker, and university campus apparel stores).</p> 
<p>Nike produces and distributes its official Nike story of sports 
endorsements, postindustrial supply chain management, and global distribution 
using postmodern culture manipulation. This link between postmodern culture and 
postindustrial supply chain has been brilliantly treated by Victoria Carty 
(1999).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(3) Postmodern cultural icons (Woods, Jordan, and stars like Gibson 
&amp; Hunt)</b> - Whereas we once worshiped the heroes of production, we now 
celebrate heroes of consumption. This is part of the postmodern condition, the 
marketing of products using endorsement sports and movie stars.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Over-branding - The over-branding of sports celebrities and Swooshes onto 
every conceivable body and life space surface has reached saturation level. The 
Swoosh is everywhere.</p> 
<p>What Nike wants is power, not the empowerment of women, as suggested in the 
recent Paramount film.</p>

WOMEN'S GROUPS URGE NIKE TO PUT ITS 
MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS:<br>
<br>
 LOW WAGES FOR WOMEN WORKERS IN SOUTHEAST 
ASIAN SWEATSHOPS DEPLORED<br>
<br>
 October 28, 1997<br>
<br>
 Washington DC -- 
The Feminist Majority joined the National Organization for Women and other 
women's organizations in deploring Nike's use of overseas sweatshops which 
exploit women workers, paying them as little as 20 cents per hour or $1.60 a 
day in Vietnam - hardly enough to eat on, let alone pay rent, clothing, health 
care and more. Nike women's empowerment ads aimed at the US market are in sharp 
contrast to the treatment of women workers in these sweatshops. Eighty to 
ninety percent of the workers in these sweatshops of Vietnam, Indonesia, and 
China are women...
<p>&quot;The message in Nike's women's empowerment ads are strong,&quot; said 
Feminist Majority President, Eleanor Smeal, &quot;but there's a disconnect 
between that message and the way Nike pays and treats its workers, especially 
its women workers. Sweatshops, which all of us thought were a thing of the 
past, are back again. And just like the feminists at the turn of the century 
fought sweatshops, it's incumbent on us to do the same.&quot; (Ann Kaplan, 
Feminist Criticism and TV)</p>

<p><b>(4) Transgovernment relations (among 1st &amp; 3rd world governments 
applying more or less legal codes)</b>- Will World Governments Regulate Nike's 
Global Sweatshop Supply Chain? One of the central issues is what is the role of 
government in sweatshop monitoring? For now, governments in the 1st and 3rd 
World let Nike hire its own monitors. However with increased numbers of reports 
of factory abuses, it is likely that there will be more government intervention 
into this area. In a proposal to Nike Corporation, Boje et al (2000) have 
outlined the risks of escalation of governments mandating Nike and 
subcontractor reforms.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>TABLE ONE: SIX LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT ON GLOBAL ENTERPRISE 
MONITORING</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Level 1 </b>- The government takes no formal role in apparel monitoring 
forums, legislation or research. Monitoring is left to the voluntary action of 
the global enterprise, its subcontractors, labor unions, workers, and 
non-governmental organizations.</p> 
<p><b>Level 2 </b>- The government encourages corporations to establish codes 
of conduct as it did in the case of the Apparel Partnership following public 
outcry over the apparel industry practices in Indonesia in 1991, Kathy Lee and 
sweatshops in 1996, and the rise in campus protests over apparel monitoring in 
the last five years.</p> 
<p><b>Level 3</b> - The government facilitates forums and research into the 
myriad of codes between such entities as Apparel Partnership, universities, 
Fair Labor Association, Workers Rights Consortium, Collegiate Apparel, SA8000, 
and other organizations with codes. These codes vary according to corporate or 
non-corporate control and the inclusion or exclusion of areas such as living 
wage, right of workers to associate, enforcement of local national laws. This 
would mean establishing research grants for university research into such 
issues as the viability and effectiveness of codes of conduct, what is a 
sweatshop, how to measure living wages, and the relationship between the 
university and organizations such as Fair Labor Association, Workers Rights 
Consortium, and Collegiate Apparel who offer alternative and different 
monitoring standards and programs.</p> 
<p><b>Level 4</b> - The government monitors everything from barbershops, 
beauticians, and chiropractors. The government could begin to monitor the 
claims and practices of consulting firms and non-governmental organizations 
such as Global Alliance, Price Waterhouse Coopers, Fair Labor Association, 
Workers Rights Consortium, etc. who either offer apparel factory monitoring or 
certify and recommend those who do or procedures for monitoring the apparel 
industry. This is done through the establishment of an agency for apparel 
monitoring of worker rights and environmental accountability.</p> 
<p><b>Level 5 </b>-The government enacts laws that oversee the certification 
and re-certification of monitoring programs to meet minimum standards for 
workers rights and environmental accountability.</p> 
<p><b>Level 6 - </b>Transgovernment trade agreements that include ecological, 
wage, health and safety standards for global enterprises and subcontract 
factories.</p> </blockquote> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Public protest around the world, on college campuses, in factories, and in 
the streets of various nations has been a main reason that government has 
become involved in how global enterprises have begun to behave with more 
conscience and ethics. A corporate sense of ethics and social accountability 
that is independent of government action has been a second 
rationale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(5) Education (programs to change student perceptions of Nike)</b> - One 
of the overlooked authors of management communication discourse are 
multinational corporations (MNCs) such as Monsanto, Disney, McDonalds, Wal-Mart 
and others whose annual reports, press releases, advertising, and sponsored 
research and consultant reports becomes the stuff on which others' discourses 
rests. Corporate writing is embedded in a web of media, accounting, consultant, 
and ad writing that seeps into academic writing (student, doctoral, and 
professorial) that influences how groups, such as unions, state, women, 
minorities, and populist movements get characterized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> St John's University students' first-hand inspections conditions of some 
subcontract factories (Nike, 2000b). Nike's $750 million dollar advertising 
budget for writing and the sponsored apologist writing has spawned reactionary 
and resistance writing (Bissell et al, 2000), but that is not what makes its 
way into the Business College classroom. Consider what Nike (2000a) posts in 
its corporate web site:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Knight succeeded of his own accord, of course. But luckily for Lehigh, some 
of his seminal business insight for the company that became Nike has gone into 
a class that Professor Karen Collins had designed for incoming freshman in 
Lehigh's College of Business and Economics at the Bethlehem, Penn. school.</p> 
<p>For the third year, Collins will use Nike as the model for a class of some 
260 freshmen taking her Introduction to Business course. With full cooperation 
and support from Nike, students get a firsthand look at how the global athletic 
company does business, including marketing, finance and global responsibility 
issues. Students then ultimately design business plans for fictitious companies 
based on what they learn</p> 
<p>In the first year of her program, Collins used a large American automaker 
as the model, but student interest was low. She polled the class about which 
company they'd rather learn about, and the nearly unanimous vote was for Nike. 
&quot;They buy the product, they know the ads,&quot; she says. &quot;It was a 
natural fit.&quot;</p> 
<p>At the end of the semester, when the business plans are done, an 
independent judging group from Anderson Consulting reviews the plans and 
selects a winner. Members of the top three teams are each awarded a share of 
Nike stock and are honored at a daylong event in New York City. Nike awards a 
$2,000 prize for the best plan.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Nike provides course materials, access to Nike executives, and financial 
incentives that make student or faculty-critique of Nike at St. John's 
problematic. For example, such a course could include examples of how Nike is a 
writer of ghettoized race, questionable labor practices (Bissell et. al, 2000), 
and gender portrayals (Cole, 1996, 1997; Cole &amp; Hribar, 1995), and for its 
economic development and ecology rhetoric (Boje, 1998d, 1998g, 1999b) and 
global postmodern consumerism culture (Carty, 1999).</p> 
<p>Students of organization as well as journalists, investors, consumers, and 
activists read and write about Nike's and critics' writing. But, the writing 
opportunities are corporately financed, staged, and otherwise controlled. For 
example, Nike (2000b, c, d) sponsored 16 students from St. John's University to 
study code of conduct compliance auditing practices of Price Waterhouse Coopers 
and visit &quot;some&quot; Nike factories. The reports are posted to Nike's 
(2000b) corporate web site along with a transcript of a conference call (Nike, 
2000c) and Nike's (e.g. 1998, 2000d) response to issues raised. Critics are 
skeptical of Nike-arranged factory tours to only 32 of over 600 locations. The 
question is, do off-the-tour factories operate in ways that violate Nike's code 
of conduct and are just not being reported in the FLA, Global Alliance, and 
Price Waterhouse Coopers studies (Bissell et al, 2000).&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(6) Nike is the Leader of a pack of competitors </b>- Nike and Reebok 
once traded market shares, but not anymore.&nbsp; Nike generated about $9 
billion in sales in 2000, making it the market leader. What is interesting 
about these competitors, is the way the follow the market leader. Where Nike 
goes, so do its competitors, even co-locating in the same factory.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(7) </b><b>Investors and consumers (who purchase stocks and products) 
</b>- Protests at annual shareholder meetings have become so newsworthy and 
regular that Nike has moved its annual meetings away from Beaverton 
Oregon.&nbsp; Yet, the protests continue.&nbsp; However, shareholder vote down 
initiatives voiced by protesters.&nbsp; And consumers continue to purchase 
products even when they are made aware of sweatshop conditions. Yet, the 
consumer boycott is growing. &quot; What Nike is learning, presumably, is that 
a growing percentage of shoppers take account of a company's conduct and 
reputation when deciding whether to buy its products. While this is good news 
for a few businesses, many others are finding themselves targets for and often 
embarrassing public criticism&quot; - Marketing; London; Oct 26, 2000 by Tania 
Mason, Page: 27).&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>(8) Workers (in Beaverton, Oregon, expatriates, and 3rd World mostly 
young females</b> - Nike has several types of workers. First, the workers in 
Beaverton, Oregon who work on a campus like facility, receive top benefits, and 
time off for recreation and sports.&nbsp; Then there are roughly a thousand 
expatriates who travel the globe to insure that subcontractors adhere to 
product quality and labor standards.&nbsp; These are the Nike employees 
celebrated in Annual Reports (Landrum, 2000).&nbsp; But, then there are the 
600,000 factory subcontract workers (mostly women between 16 and 22) who do the 
cutting, gluing and sewing.&nbsp; What do Nike factory workers look like?</p> 
<p></p>

<p></p> 
<p>Vietnam Nike - Dara O'Rourke Photo</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nike Vietnam - Oregonian Photo</p> 
<p>Despite the militaristic and subservient photos, there is worker 
resistance. There is no power without resistance , and female (and some male) 
workers are providing the resistance to Nike corporate power and subcontractor 
practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The workers shall live one day as the bourgeois do 
now - but<i>above</i> them, distinguished by their freedom from wants, the <i>
higher caste</i>: that is to say poorer and simpler, but in possession of 
power&quot;&nbsp;(WTP, 764). Cheap women's labor is the attractor to the 
tranational corporate investment that is integral to globalization.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The purpose, in my view, of the Nike storytelling organization is to keep 
the supply web as secretive as possible, while parading a few flagship 
locations as indicative of all 700 factory locations. There are facts about 
subcontractor factory life, that do not make it into the press releases about 
Tiger Woods. &quot;According to one of the local papers, there are at least 
50,000 fingers cut off in industrial accidents every year in China&quot; 
(Source). The storytelling machine has an easier task since supply chains are 
already complex and hard to decipher:&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For example, if factory A cannot complete an order of 10,000, they might 
give 4,000 to factory B, where the conditions are worse. We find that it is 
very hard to track the locations of the factories because the subcontracting 
system is so complicated. That's why we try to press multinational corporations 
to disclose information about all of their suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p> Out of the birth of tragic sweatshop conditions of exploitation and 
terror, is born the will to resist corporate power by the women tending the 
cutting, gluing, and sewing machines.&nbsp; The women of Nike are becoming 
steeled as a higher form of being, with a will to achieve their own aristocracy 
and empire.&nbsp; Nietzsche, like Marx, say them as the future of great social 
movements and revolutions.&nbsp;Including the voice of the workers, while 
essential, must also be done with great care. In the past there have been 
workers who have been fired and otherwise disciplined for participating in 
studies and media reporting on Nike factories&nbsp;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Ms. Nguyen Thi Lap, a worker for the Nike 
subcontractor, Sam Yang in Cu Chi, HCMC Vietnam&nbsp; started working for Nike 
in October 1995. In March 1996, she was promoted to section leader of Sewing 
Line No: 15.&nbsp; She was interviewed by ESPN in February 1998.&nbsp; Two 
months later she was demoted and punished by the company.&nbsp; After having 
gone through a series of punishments, she realized that she cannot take it any 
more and she eventually quit working for Sam Yang in May 1998.&nbsp;(See the 
case of Miss Lap Nguyen). Here are excerpts from the interview:</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p> <i> </i>When I became sick, I went to the clinic.&nbsp; The doctor said 
that I have fever of 37 degree C..&nbsp; On the&nbsp; Sunday the 29th while 
working overtime, I was working very hard and being sick at the same time, so I 
got a really bad headache.&nbsp; So I put my hands on my head.&nbsp; The 
manager then hit me in the arm.&nbsp; After the manager hits me, I could not 
work so I went to the nurse to take the rest of day off.&nbsp; I took another 
day off the Monday.&nbsp; When I came back on Tuesday,&nbsp; the personnel 
manager Tran said that section leader cannot take sick day, and demoted me to 
become a sewer.&nbsp; But the plant manager did not let me sew.&nbsp; Some day 
they made me cut threads, some day they made me do pressing (?) and continued 
to move me around from one job to another.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <br>
So I filed a 
complaint with the union and asked the union resolve the conflict.&nbsp; During 
the time while waiting for the union&#146;s action, they make me do very menial 
work.&nbsp; Let me tell you, I was a section leader overseeing 50 workers.&nbsp;
Why do they have to punish me this way?&nbsp; Why don&#146;t they recognize my 
past contribution to the company?&nbsp; There were times they make me mop the 
floor on the second floor.&nbsp; Because I was a section leader, I am too 
ashamed to carry a bucket of water and so I asked a friend to take the bucket 
up for me. <br>

<p>While I was mopping the floor, I was crying. </p> <br>

<p><i>Lap starts to cry. </i> </p> <br>

<p>Do you think the treatment was related to the interview <i>(translator 
note: with ESPN)</i>? </p> <br>

<p>When the union asked me to do the interview,&#133; right before I did the 
interview, the manager told me that since I&#146;m an employee of this company 
I should said nice thing about the company, that the company is currently 
facing problems.&nbsp; After the interview, the manager (Bak) called me up and 
asked me what I told the reporter.&nbsp; I told her that I only talked about 
wages.&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked me if I told the reporter whether the company 
still beats workers. As soon as she questioned me, she asked me to leave.
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p>After the interview, I was asked to lead another sewing line in a different 
plant.&nbsp; But the people the company staffed the line were not experienced 
sewers and they were trainees.&nbsp; I told the manager that without 
experienced sewers, it&#146;s going to be hard to get the quota done.&nbsp; The 
manager told me that it would take time for people to gain experience.&nbsp; I 
told the manager that it would be hard for me to complete my quota with only 
trainees.&nbsp; The manager assured me that she understood the situation.&nbsp; 
</p> <br>

<p>Do you still wants to work at that place?&nbsp; Did they force you to quit? 
</p> <br>

<p>I just want my job as a sewer.&nbsp; I don&#146;t want them to punish me by 
making do menial works, switching me to different jobs.&nbsp; My hand were 
getting swollen from repairing the shoes and their punishment.&nbsp; So I asked 
the union to resolve the problem.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p>Nike no longer employs child labor, after the Life Magazine expos of 
children making Nike and Reebok soccer balls (See Pakistan). Yet, from time to 
time, Nike subcontractors do employ child labor. The recurrent use of child 
labor, while the exception, is a public relations nightmare for Nike. A recent 
BBC Panorama expos report filmed Nike and GAP child labor in a Cambodian 
sweatshop (SeeBBC, Panorama web site -&nbsp; &quot;Gap and Nike: No

<p><b>(9) Postmodern network of resistors to the leadership of Nike in the 
global stage of postmodern capitalism</b> - Knowingly or not, many of us wear 
garments made in sweatshops. Nike is resisted by a growing movement to make 
consumers aware of sweatshop practices of global corporations such as GAP, 
Wal-Mart, Reebok, Adidas, Nike and others. Nike is the lightning rod for a 
postmodern network of resistors to its leadership. For example, Nike was a key 
protest target in the WTO protest of Seattle last year. And &quot;Nike's sales 
plummeted after it was singled out as a sweatshop culprit&quot; (Source
http://www.wslc.org/reports/latest.htm ).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Campus Protest<b> -</b> On college campuses Nike and 
other apparel manufacturers are attacked regularly in speeches, street theater 
and sit-ins reminiscent of the 1970s Vietnam war rallies.&nbsp; Nike's 
corporate strategy is to enroll universities in their Fair Labor Association 
(FLA), while campus radicals hold non-violent protests until the administration 
and faculty vote in the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). The race is on and 
enrollments are in the two associations are running neck and neck. You probably 
heard the news story that Phil Knight canceled his endowment to the University 
of Oregon.&nbsp;</p> &quot;Nike's founder and chairman, Philip H. Knight, said 
in April that he would give no more money to Oregon, his alma mater, because it 
was joining the Worker Rights Consortium, an anti-sweatshop group backed mainly 
by students and labor groups. He criticized, among other things, the group's 
approach to monitoring apparel factories (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 
May 5, 2000).&quot; (&quot;Oregon withholds dues to worker-rights group&quot; 
The Chronicle of Higher Education; Washington; Nov 10, 2000; Volume:&nbsp; 47 
Issue:&nbsp; 11:A40). <br>
the USDA has &quot;locked campuses nationwide with 
protests against sweatshop conditions in the collegiate apparel industry, 
occupying buildings on more than a dozen campuses. The protests forced more 
than fifty universities and colleges to capitulate to students' demands and

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) and James Keady, a student turned 
activist,&nbsp; spend their free time promoting a new Nike image,&nbsp; with 
young girls spending 12 to 14 hours a day in 100-degree heat, six days a week, 
on an Nike assembly line in Asia gluing sports shoes while they breathe toxic 
toluene fumes and earn about a dollar&nbsp; a day. And Nike's CEO Phil Knight 
has been playing Nietzschean Superman, and as the Chronicle of Higher Education 
put it &quot;unleashed a full-court press against the Worker Rights Consortium 
late last month, and athletics departments across the country may find 
themselves wilting under the pressure&quot; (Suggs, 2000).&nbsp;&nbsp;For more 
on spectacle,see Guy Debord's work. Beneath the coliseum, the spectacle 
gladiator sports heroes, is the dirty &quot;sweat&quot; work of feudalistic 
capitalism, invisible to the postmodern spectacle late capitalism.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; The irony is that feudalistic sweatshop factory work so prevalent at 
the dawn of the industrial revolution is once again the motor of the postmodern 
knowledge and service revolution.&nbsp; The global economy has evolved from 
production to consumption capitalism, but feudalistic sweatshops is apparently 
here to stay.&nbsp; The kinds of leadership in the Nike supply chain, running 
from Beaverton to the subcontractor factories in Asia, to the showrooms of 
Footlocker, NikeTown, and the campus apparel store must somehow convince that 
savvy postmodern consumer, that the age of feudalistic sweatshops is not 
reality.&nbsp; This is no small feat of leadership given the hundreds of web 
activists, university intellectuals, and skeptical journalists who find Nike's 
claims that sweatshops do not exist hard to swallow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What follows is an<b> </b>interview with Alice Kwan, a researcher with the 
Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC), where she monitors labor 
conditions in South China, with a particular focus on the garment and footwear 
industries. The Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee has been working for 
the rights of workers since 1967.&nbsp;</p> Kwan: In Nike's Code of Conduct, 
they say they respect the right to organize. In the past few years,<br>
 Nike 
has told us that they would like to keep their promise and respect the right to 
organize in China. But they also say, &quot;It is very sensitive. It is not 
allowed and we don't want to do anything to violate the law, we can't do 
anything. We are sorry.&quot; So they wash their hands and shift responsibility 
to the Chinese government.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Nike is very clever. We heard that 
they also told their Taiwanese partner, Yue Yuen, &quot;No matter, help them to 
organize.&quot; But this is manipulated by the factory management. Mostly, the 
trade union is<br>
 composed of the management only and workers have no say in 
it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Besides, all of the unions have to affiliate with the All 
China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU).<br>
 ACFTU is the only union allowed 
in China. It is controlled by the Communist Party and the government, so the 
workers have no right to independent organizing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Most of the 
Nike workers who we have asked whether or not they have a trade union in their 
factory<br>
 don't know. When we ask those that say there is a union what the 
union does, they say they organize<br>
 picnics, karaoke singing contests, a 
monthly birthday party, but they never try to help solve labor disputes or 
stand with the workers.&nbsp;

<h2> PART III - ONE POSSIBLE ANSWER&nbsp; </h2> 
<h2> <b>How Might Nike Transform its Supply Chain of Feudalistic Sweatshops 
into French Taylorism?</b> </h2> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One answer to Nike's moral leadership dilemmas would be 
to conduct action research experiments that would convince executives and 
factory owners and managers that feudalistic sweatshop practices are less 
profitable and less efficient than more modern and even postmodern ones. 45 
academic scholars have organized into four study groups and made a proposal to 
put the question of sweatshops versus modern factory methods to an empirical 
test (Boje et al, 2000).&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the action 
research is to develop interdisciplinary work and dialogue that will address a 
set of action research questions that is of growing concern to academics, the 
general public, and the Nike Corporation. Basic research while important is not 
sufficient. Specifically we propose to work with a sample of factories (the 
size and location will be determined with Nike and stakeholder input).&nbsp; 
The result we anticipate is to be able to contrast different forms of 
pay-systems and work design and working conditions. The implementation will be 
according to action research methods. That is, an effort that involves workers, 
managers, and other stakeholders, including the study groups we list below in 
the design of the experiments we are proposing.&nbsp;We propose to embark upon 
action research initiative that brings various stakeholders (researchers, 
workers, corporate executives, managers, subcontractor mangers, governmental 
and non-governmental organizations) together to implement change. There has 
been a good deal of consulting (i.e. Global Alliance, Fair Labor Association, 
and Price Waterhouse Coopers) and non-governmental organization (NGO) report 
and media writing, but limited academic empirical study (See Appendix B). The 
issue is to rethink labor and environmental monitoring practices, within a 
larger context that compels a reframing of the institutions and ethics of 
development and globalization. Our purpose can be summarized to promote 
dialogue that leads to basic, applied, participatory, as well as action 
research efforts that lead to change. We have four research subgroups organized 
as follows
<p>1. <b> How has Nike enacted its espoused Code of Conduct over time?</b> 
This study group will focus on monitoring studies by PWC, FLA, and Global 
Alliance, as well as studies that support and question their methods and 
findings.</p> 
<blockquote> MIT professor, Dara O'Rourke, said in a report to be issued today 
that inspectors from the firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, had a pro- management 
bias, did not uncover the use of carcinogenic chemicals and failed to recognize 
that some employees were forced to work 80-hour weeks (Greenhouse, NY Times, 
September 28, 2000).&nbsp; <br>

&quot;Based on 
recent visits to Asia, companies such as Reebok, Nike, Liz Claiborne, and 
Mattel have finally begun enforcing their codes... Widespread gains in the 
workplace are unlikely until workers can organize unions, or a system emerges to
<br> punish violators of international codes. Even under the programs set up by 
Nike and Mattel, they are free to sell their goods in the U.S. if it turns out 
they were made under abusive conditions. But their experiments do suggest that 
not every factory has to be a sweatshop to make the global economy work&quot;

<p>3. <b> Does Nike subcontract with &quot;sweatshops&quot;?</b> What are the 
reassurances that Nike and other U.S. companies such as GAP, Toys `R' Us, 
Wal-Mart, and Payless can give to&nbsp; American consumers that their goods 
aren't produced under sweatshop conditions? nike says a &quot;sweatshop&quot; 
can not be defined. Yet, The name, sweatshop, goes back to the late 1800s, and 
refers to the technique of &quot;sweating&quot; as much profit as possible out 
of each worker. Once a thriving tradition at the turn of the century, 
sweatshops saw their numbers dwindle in the face of relentless encroachment by 
labor organization and social legislation. By the post-war years they were 
pushed to the brink of extinction. But with the new arrangements made possible 
by the global economy -- highly mobile transnational capital, 
computer-coordinated production schedules, and free trade policies (Sweat Gear 
web site).&nbsp; Apparel manufacture too often equates to sweatshop work that 
is based on modes of production and piece-wages that appears feudal in contrast 
to the kinds of factories that are recently attaining ISO9000, ISO14000, and 
SA8000 certification.&nbsp;&nbsp; This study group will look at definitions of 
sweatshops and measure said variables in a sample of subcontract factories. In 
addition, they will propose and conduct action research experiments that test 
what we described in our review as forms of French Taylorism. This way a sample 
of existing subcontract firms can be compared with the experimental 
options.&nbsp;</p>

Alliance study, &quot;workplace conditions&quot; does not include several major 
topics of concern to Thai garment and footwear workers, such as issues relating 
to wages, hours of work, freedom of association and collective bargaining. 
Though Nike describes the Global Alliance as part of Nike's overall monitoring 
program this initiative is clearly not investigating issues of basic workers 
rights.&quot; According to the main report at

Global Alliance study selected workers were asked to answer multiple choice 
questions. In this way, their priorities were suggested for them.&quot;&nbsp; 
Finally, after interviewing Luen Thai workers, the Thai Labour Campaign found 
that &quot;...they felt that the questionnaires were guiding them and tried to 
encourage them to conduct activities at the community level. The workers 
questioned why they, the workers, have to do community development while their 
working conditions were not improved.&quot; Please consult the report for

<p>There is a new survey of wages in Indonesia conducted between 10 September 
and 18 October 1999.&nbsp; The Urban Community Mission in Jakarta worked with 
Workers to survey 3,500 workers from 11 different Nike contract factories. The 
survey results allege that sweatshop and abusive management practices are 
widespread Review the survey in preparation for your response. (Press here for

Sweatshops exist in the U.S. too - A 
&quot;Garment Enforcement Report&quot; (AprilJune 1999) from the U.S. Labor 
Department reported that 205 sweatshop investigations resulted in the discovery 
of 109 violations.&quot; The Department of Labor estimates that there are over 
700 sweatshops in the U.S.&nbsp; <br>
&quot;Free-market advocates correctly 
point out that low wages are appropriate to untrained, unskilled workers and 
that many of the sweatshop conditions are no more than what naturally occur in 
the lowest-paid strata of employment&quot; (Sweatshops: Look for the INS

 Roberts, Dexter &amp; Bernstein, Aaron &quot;A Life of Fines and 
beatings,&quot; Business Week, October 2, 2000 pp. 123-128 article that looks 
at a 3-month Business Week investigation of the auditing practices of PWC for 
Wal-Mart (Kathie Lee Gifford handbags), Timberland, New Balance, and Nike. The 
implication is that &quot;auditing systems can miss serious problems -- and 
that self-policing allows companies to avoid painful public relations about 
them.&quot; And therefore a study of self-monitoring, PWC, FLA and other 
monitoring systems is needed.&nbsp; &quot;While<i>no company</i> suggests that 
its auditing systems are perfect, most say they catch major abuses and either 
force suppliers to fix them or yank production.&quot; (Summary of the Business 
Week Article). This is a Dickensian tale. Wal-Mart Director of Corporate 
Compliance Denise Fenton says its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) 
and Cal Safety Compliance Corp., had inspected Chun Si five times in 1999 and 
found that the factory didn't pay the legal overtime rate and had required 
excessive work hours.&nbsp; The Business Week study found PWC audits missed 
most of the more serious abuses: Chun Si management confiscated all ID papers 
of its workers, an illegal practice that left a worker a &quot;virtual 
captive&quot; of the factory.&nbsp; <br>
 Guards regularly punched and hit 
workers for various offenses.&nbsp; <br>
 The factory did not pay for overtime 
work.&nbsp; <br>
 Workers were paid so little, and so often fined for 
infractions, such as taking too long in the toilet, that at the end of a month 
they often owed the company money.&nbsp; <br>
In the compound, workers were 
punched and hit for by guards for talking back to managers or just for walking 
too fast.&nbsp; <br>
And they fined them up to $1 for infractions such as 
taking too long in the bathroom <br>
The Audit Studies are being faked 
(Consider this Wal-Mart Audit by Price Waterhouse Coopers): <br>
<br>
Chun Si 
then took drastic steps, apparently in an effort to pass the final audit upon 
which its contract<br>
 depended. In early November, management gave a facelift 
to the two attached five-story factory buildings, painting walls, cleaning 
workshops, even putting high-quality toilet paper in the dank bathrooms, 
according to Liu and Pang Yinguang (also not his real name), another worker 
employed there at the time whom BUSINESS WEEK interviewed in mid-September.<br>

<p>Management then split the factory into two groups. The first, with about 
200 workers, was assigned to work on the fixed-up second floor, while the 
remaining 700 or so worked on the fourth floor, leaving the other floors 
largely vacant. Managers announced that those on the fourth floor were no 
longer working for Chun Si but for a new factory they called Yecheng. Workers 
signed new labor contracts with Yecheng, whose name went up outside the fourth 
floor.<br>
<br>
 The reality soon became clear. Workers on the fourth floor, 
including Liu and Pang, were still laboring under the old egregious 
conditions--illegally low pay, 14-hour days, exorbitant fees for meals--and 
still making the same Kathie Lee handbags.</p> 
<p>``It felt like being in prison,'' says Pang, 22. But those on the second 
floor now received the local minimum wage of $55 a month and no longer had to 
do mandatory overtime. A new sign went up in the cafeteria used by workers on 
all floors explaining that the factory was a Wal-Mart supplier and should live 
up to certain labor standards. Liu says there was even a phone number workers 
could call with problems: 1-800-WM-ETHIC. ``When we saw the Wal-Mart statement, 
we felt very excited and happy because we thought that now there was a 
possibility to improve our conditions,'' says Liu.<br>
<br>
 LAST STRAW. 
Instead, they got worse. On Nov. 28, a second notice went up stating that 
starting on Dec. 10, all workers would be required to pay cash for dinner 
rather than just have money subtracted from their paychecks as before, say Liu 
and Pang. With up to 80% of workers already skipping breakfast to save money, 
the upper-floor employees were aghast, says Liu.<br>
 ``If we had left the 
factory then, we wouldn't have had even enough money for a bus ticket home,'' 
he says. ``But if we stayed, we knew we wouldn't have enough money to 
eat.''&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p><b>From FEUDALISTIC SWEATSHOPS TO FRENCH TAYLORISM -&nbsp;</b></p> 
<h2> <b>What did Karl Marx (1867), Adam Smith (1776), and Frederick Taylor 
(1911) have in common?&nbsp;</b> </h2> 
<h4> <b>ANSWER - </b>They agreed that there are organizational alternatives to 
sweatshops that yield more productivity, profit, and net workers higher 
wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4> 
<p><b>What about the influence of wage rates? </b>Smith (1976) in the&nbsp; 
Wealth of Nations, saw the choice about paying each worker a &quot;living 
wage&quot; was clear, economic and moral:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be 
sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat 
more; otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the 
race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation (Smith, 1776, 
CHAPTER VIII Of the Wages of Labor).&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Adam Smith did not favor sweatshops. </b>Adam Smith, among others, 
contended that interests of self-centered interests of merchants and 
manufacturers ran counter to the general welfare of society.&nbsp;<b> </b>Smith 
advocated local accountability, moral reasoning, and a limit to bigness of 
business.&nbsp;Smith did favor the landowners over the merchants and 
manufacturers.</p> 
<p>The proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular country 
in which his estate lies.&nbsp; The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen 
of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country (WN, 2: 
848). </p> Smith argued for the primacy of agrarian capitalism over industrial 
capitalism. 
<p>What was revolutionary about Taylor's scientific management, was the 
observation that rest and refreshment are necessary to quality and sustained 
work. Any profit gained by overwork and snatching time for mealtimes and rest 
breaks and from paying the least possible bare subsistence wage and over-work 
in unhealthy and unpleasant situations was meager compared to the output of the 
high productivity enterprise. In short, both Taylor and Marx held out solutions 
to sweatshops' &quot;slow sacrifice of humanity&quot; (Marx, 1867: 244).</p> 
<p>For Marx, piece-wage was a special form of time-wage. &quot;In time-wages 
the labor is measured by its immediate duration, in piece-wages by the quantity 
of products in which the labor has embodied itself during a given time&quot; 
(1867: 553). And piece-wages, from his point of view, afforded the &quot;source 
of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating&quot; of workers (p. 553). 
That is, with piece-wages, the incentive is for the capitalist to parasitically 
&quot;sub-let&quot; labor by using the services of middlemen (subcontractors). 
&quot;In England this system is characteristically called the &quot;Sweating 
system.&quot;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>On the one hand piece-wage allows the capitalist to make a contract for so 
much per piece with the head laborer--in manufactures with the chief of some 
group, in mines with the extract of the coal, in the factory with the actual 
machine-worker--at a price for which the head laborer himself undertakes the 
enlisting and payment of his assistant workpeople (p. 554).</p> </blockquote> 
</blockquote> 
<p>To Marx, it is in the personal interest of the subcontractor using 
piece-wage systems to &quot;strain his labor-power as intensely as 
possible&quot; by lengthening the working-day. And this is exactly what we have 
witnessed in apparel manufacture: without the external control of government or 
the global enterprise's policies and codes, subcontractors use piece-wage and 
extend the working day, as well as the number of days worked each month. In 
Marx's day, the &quot;Children's Employment Commission: and other agencies 
intervened to change working and employment practices.</p> 
<p>Piece-wage is the main pay system in today's apparel subcontract factory. 
Marx hypothesized that piece-wage is paid such that it becomes the average 
wage, thereby negating any incentive for independence, self-control, or 
liberty. &quot;Piece-work has, therefore, a tendency, while raising the 
individual wages above the average, to lower this average itself&quot; for the 
workforce. In practice, the quotas in the apparel industry are adjusted to keep 
the piece-wage to a bare minimum and working conditions such as rest periods 
and subcontractors avoid training in more efficient production methods, unless 
external controls are enforced. The assumption of the subcontractor is that 
since the alternative to work is starvation or more rigorous demands of 
agriculture, those workers have ample incentive to produce. This is defined 
here, as feudalistic sweatshop practice. We would like to conduct research that 
would implement and test experiments in alternative pay schemes.</p> 
<p>For example, going back to Taylor (1911), his innovation in pay schemes was 
to introduce the idea of differential piece-rate systems. In his series of 
experiments he demonstrated that workers when performing a carefully calibrated 
and planned task, would increase their effort when wages increased by 60 per 
cent (p. 74). In short, raising quotas and extending the working day, were 
found to be less productive alternatives than ensuring &quot;prosperity for the 
employee, coupled with prosperity for the employer&quot; the key to his 
compensation philosophy.</p> 
<p>For Taylor, the solution to feudalistic sweatshop factories was to convince 
employee and employer, that through scientific experimentation, work conditions 
and work processes could be redesigned so that workers toiled few hours, with 
more rest breaks, and at higher pay, while the firm enjoyed the fruits of sharp 
increases in production. It is our proposal to test Taylor's option in the 
apparel industry. That is to move from what is called &quot;extreme 
Taylorism&quot; managing work processes with central control and high division 
of labor, to what Taylor had originally described, a system of work which is 
productive for employers and prosperous for employees.</p> 
<p>Taylor (1911: 14-18) argued that it is possible to have prosperity for both 
owners and workers and the diminution of poverty and the alleviation of human 
suffering. We believe this is an attainable objective for the Nike corporation, 
its subcontractors, and global workforce. Taylor concludes, &quot;the writer 
has great sympathy with those who are over-worked, but on the whole a greater 
sympathy for those who are<i>under paid</i>&quot; (p. 18). This is the gist of 
our attempt to prove that living wage payment and healthy working conditions 
combined with scientific work processes makes economic sense.</p> <b> </b>
<p><b>French Taylorism - Defined - </b>In a special edition of <i>Journal of 
Organizational Change Management</i>, Dominique Besson and Slimane Haddadj 
(2000) review post-Taylor approaches. Different countries throughout the world 
including Asia and Europe have implemented Taylorism quite differently. We 
hypothesize the implementation in apparel factories in Southeast Asia is the 
reverse to the Taylorian philosophy itself, and even a return to the 
feudalistic factory conditions and piece-wage compensation schemes of the 
1800s. By contrast, French Taylorists implemented what Besson (2000) describes 
a more postmodern approach. It is more accurately &quot;critical 
postmodern.&quot; On the one hand, it is an approach with strong links to 
Braverman's (1976)<i>Labor and Monopoly Capital</i> project and Marx's (1867) 
critique of sweatshops and piece-wages. On the other hand, the postmodernists 
see a drift between what Taylorism was in Taylor's day, and what it is now, in 
France (and elsewhere). Instead of taking an anti-Taylorism approach, Besson 
(2000) argues that the post-war configurations of Taylorism in France have not 
adopted the deskilling system that Braverman points out. But are French workers 
more &quot;empowered&quot; compared to Asian workers?&nbsp; French workers are 
not disempowered from their knowledge and know-how (Besson, 2000: 425). At the 
same time, French Taylorism achieved high increases in productivity and 
efficiency in &quot;an informal kind of postmodern administration&quot; (p. 
426). First, instead of implementing flexible work rules, the French prefer to 
keep those rules more rigid, in order to give employees confidence in the work 
design. The French adjusted rigid Taylor principles to allow for continuous 
improvements in work designs and such postmodern notions as &quot;work autonomy 
spaces&quot; (p. 434). Second, the wage contract is considered an essential way 
in which workers negotiate with management in order to adjust work conditions, 
skill levels, wages, and the authority system. In this way workers in French 
Taylorism have a way to invoke resistance as well as ongoing-negotiation, as 
part of the work organization. This is not a totalizing consensus seeking 
strategy; it is one where parties know what side of the bargaining table they 
sit on. Third, instead of management total control over the system of work, 
employees can avoid such productive despotism by co-control over work 
processes. Multi-skilling, for example, is seen as a way to enhance worker's 
negotiating position. Fourth, Taylorism, in its French manifestation, is part 
of a plurality of perspectives. Management and worker, as well as customer and 
supplier have voice in the postmodern version. &quot;There existed, and there 
still exists today, a coded social dialog between workers, union officials, 
organizers and the hierarchical management&quot; (p. 434). Fifth, the French 
variation of Taylorism is based on a conflict-engagement approach in which 
employers and employees actively consider social power and diversity and the 
dangers of hegemony. Sixth, my own observations of French Taylorism is that 
working conditions, including good food, rest breaks, and those long French 
vacations make quite a difference.</p> 
<p><b>Could Taylorism in France be assimilated into the Asian subcontract 
apparel system?</b> It is a question that merits scientific study. Our proposed 
experiment stands as alternative to increased levels of governmental regulation 
of industry working conditions. French Taylorism is a mid range solution 
between trade unionism and feudalistic sweatshops. It is an improvement over 
classical Taylorism, that allows piece-wage systems to be modified in ways that 
increase productivity and worker wage levels, while affording workers avenues 
of resistance to totalizing systems of control.</p> 
<p>Our proposal to the Nike Corporation and its subcontractors is to 
experiment and scientifically compare alternative work design, work conditions, 
and wage-incentive schemes. It represents a step forward in establishing 
stakeholder dialogue and getting beyond expose research projects, or nave 
consulting reports, that do not detail methodology nor go beyond the report to 
actually implement meaningful change. Why not try French Taylorization as a 
possible improvement over &quot;extreme&quot; forms of Taylorization now in use 
in the apparel industry in third world nations?</p> 
<p><b>The Experiment&nbsp; </b>In short, we hypothesize that the modern 
scientifically managed subcontract factory will dramatically out-produce and 
out-pay the feudal sweatshop. We seek permission to run this experiment. Taylor 
(1911: 92-96, 136-143) hypothesized that better working conditions including 
shorter hours (from 12 to 8.5 hours), rest periods four times a day, paid days 
off each month for &quot;girls&quot; (his term), and rigorous scientific work 
procedures would lead to both higher factory output and higher wage levels and 
therefore to more harmonious relations between employer and employees. Taylor 
also included &quot;the consumers, who buy the product&quot; of employer and 
employees &quot;and who ultimately pay both the wages of the workmen and the 
profits of the employers&quot; (p. 136). This described the global 
subcontracting production and distribution network of Nike Corporation. Taylor 
was able to convince sweatshop owners and their subcontractors that this 
hypothesis had scientific validity. We believe that by turning from consultant 
and monitor reporting to scientific study (quantitative and qualitative) and to 
action research experimentation, that we can convince subcontract factory 
owners and managers, that sweatshops are not as profitable as the modern firm.
</p> 
<h3> <b>Conclusions</b> </h3> 
<p>Phil Knight exercises a strength of will to power and conviction, and&nbsp; 
begrudging negotiation with activists that can only be described as 
&quot;enlightened despotism.&quot; It is a WTP to keep from falling into the 
disordered chaos of the democratic impulse or the humanitarian impulse to pay 
living wages to 600,000 workers. It is the WTP of the Robber Barons at the dawn 
of the industrial age, renewed in this postmodern global economy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Nike corporation camouflages its sweatshops in spectacles of sports 
gladiators, whose symbolic Swoosh is purchased in heroic worship by admiring 
consumers.&nbsp; Beneath the Coliseum where this spectacle plays on its global 
stage in TV and every ad imaginable, there are the beating hearts of 600,000 
sweatshop workers (mostly young women).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What I have proposed is a way for Nike to sustain its global economic 
power, but enjoy the fruits of modern factory practices. We would like Nike to 
let us academics into the factory gates to conduct some action research 
experiments. We believe that Nike can deep six the sweatshop practices in favor 
of some French Taylorist ones. We believe that paying a living wage will result 
in higher profits to both Nike and its subcontractors.&nbsp; The sports 
gladiators can continue to sell Swoosh apparel, and workers can move up a notch 
on the food chain.&nbsp;</p>
