<p> </p> <b>About pie</b> 
<p> Pie--the filling and baking of sweet (fruits, nuts, cheese) or savory 
(meat, fish, eggs, cheese) ingredients and spices in casings composed of flour, 
fat, and water is an ancient practice. The basic concept of pies and tarts has 
changed little throughout the ages. Cooking methods (baked or fried in ancient 
hearths, portable colonial/pioneer Dutch ovens, modern ovens),pastry composition
 (flat bread, flour/fat/water crusts, puff paste, milles feuilles), and 
cultural preference (pita, pizza, quiche, shepherd's, lemon meringue, classic 
apple, chocolate pudding?) All figure prominently into the complicated history 
of this particular genre of food.</p> 
<p>The first pies were very simple and generally of the savory (meat and 
cheese) kind. Flaky pastry fruit-filled turnovers appeared in the early 19th 
century. Some pie-type foods are made forindividual consumption. These portable 
pies... pasties, turnovers, empanadas, pierogi, calzones...were enjoyed by 
working classes and sold by street vendors. Pie variations (cobblers, slumps, 
grunts, etc.) are endless!</p> 
<p>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces the first use of the word 
&quot;pie&quot; as it relates to food to 1303, noting the word was well-known 
and popular by 1362.</p> 
<p> &quot;Pie...a word whose meaning has evolved in the course of many 
centuries and which varies to some extent according to the country or even to 
region....The derivation of the word may be from magpie, shortened to pie. The 
explanation offered in favour or this is that the magpie collects a variety of 
things, and that it was an essential feature of early pies that they contained 
a variety of ingredients....Early pies were large; but one can now apply the 
name to something small, as the small pork pies or mutton pies...Early pies had 
pastry tops, but modern pies may have a topping of something else...or even be 
topless. If the basic concept of a pie is taken to mean a mixture of 
ingredients encased and cooked in pastry, then proto-pies were made in the 
classical world and pies certainly figured in early Arab cookery.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>American pies</b></p> 
<p> &quot;As a favored dish of the English, pies were baked in America as soon 
as the early settlers set up housekeeping on dry land. Beyond mere preference, 
howevers, there was a practical reason for making pies, especially in the harsh 
and primitive conditions endured by the first colonists. A piecrust used less 
flour than bread and did not require anything as complicated as a brick oven 
for baking. More important, though, was how pies could stretch even the most 
meager provisions into sustaining a few more hungry mouths...No one, least of 
all the early settlers, would probably proclaim their early pies as 
masterpieces of culinary delight. The crusts were often heavy, composed of some 
form of rough flour mixed with suet.&quot;<br>

 Food historians trace the 
genesis of pastry to ancient mediterranean paper-thin multi-layeredbaklava and 
filo. Returning crusaders introduced these sweet recipes to Medieval Europe 
where they were quickly adopted. French and Italian Renaissance chefs are 
credited for perfectingpuff pastry and choux. 17th and 18th century chefs 
introduced several new recipes, includingbrioche, Napoleons,  cream puffs and 
eclairs. Antonin Careme (1784-1833) is said to have elevated French pastry to 
art. In Central and Eastern Europe, strudels evolved. Sweet yeast-breads and 
cakes share a parallel history. Aboutcoffee cakes &amp; galettes. 
<p> &quot;Small sweet cakes eaten by the ancient Egyptians may well have 
included types using pastry. With their fine flour, oils, and honey they had 
the materials, and with their professional bakers they had the skills. In the 
plays of Aristophenes (5th century BC) there are mentions of sweetmeats 
including small pastries filled with fruit. Nothing is known of the actual 
pastry used, but the Greeks certainly recognized the trade of pastry-cook as 
distinct from that of baker. The Romans made a plain pastry of flour, oil, and 
water to cover meats and fowls which were baked, thus keeping in the juices. 
(The covering was not meant to be eaten; it filled the role of what was later 
called puff paste') A richer pastry, intended to be eaten, was used to make 
small pasties containing eggs or little birds which were among the minor items 
served at banquets....In Medieval Northern Europe the usual cooking fats were 
lard and butter, which--especially lard--were conducive to making stiff pastry 
and permitted development of the solid, upright case of the raised pie...No 
medieval cookery books give detailed instructions on how to make pastry; they 
assume the necessary knowledge...Not all Medieval pastry was coarse. Small 
tarts would be made with a rich pastry of fine white flour, butter, sugar, 
saffron, and other good things, certainly meant to be eaten. From the middle of 
the 16th century on, actual recipes for pastry begin to appear. ..The first 
recipe for something recognizable as puff pastry is in Dawson [The Good 
Housewife's Jewell, London]...1596.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food
</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 586-7). </p> 
<p> &quot;Greek pistores had mastered the art of giving their bread the most 
extravagant forms, shaping it like mushrooms, braids, crescents, and so 
on...thus illustrating in advance Careme's observation a thousand years later: 
&quot;The fine arts are five in number, namely: painting, sculpture, poetry, 
music and architecture, the principal branch of the latter being pastry.&quot; 
And since it is not possible for us to discuss flour without dealing with 
cakes, the moment has come to pose the question of what pastry consisted of in 
antiquity, what it looked like and how it was made. The regrettable loss of the 
great<i>Treatise on Baking</i>, by Chrysippus of Tyranus, which included 
detailed reicpes for more than thirty cakes, each entirely different, leaves us 
somewhat short of information on this important subject. But various 
cross-checks (not to mention the consulation of Apicius) nonetheless give us a 
rather good idea of what the ancient Greeks and Romans confected in this 
domain...the makers of Greco-Roman pastry had no knowledge of the subleties of 
dough, and thus having nothing like our present-day babas, doughnuts, bioches, 
savarins, creampuffs, millefeuille pastry, pastry made from raised dough or 
shortbreads...as a general rule, Greek pastry closely resembled the sort that 
is still found today in North Africa, the Near East, and the Balkans: the basic 
mixture was honey, oil, and flour, plus various aromatic substances, notably 
pepper. The most frequent method of cooking was frying, but pastry was also 
cooked beneath coals. Other ingredients included pine nuts, walnuts, dates, 
almonds, and poppy seeds. This mixture was mainly baked in the form of thin 
round cakes and in the form doughnuts and fritters...Roman pastry does not 
appear to have included many innovations over and above what the Greeks had 
already invented.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Professional pastry guilds &amp; chefs</b></p> 
<p> &quot;Patissiere...Prehistoric man made sweet foods based on maple or 
birch syrup, wild honey, fruits, and seeds. It is thought that the idea of 
cooking a cereal paste on a stone in the sun to make pancakes began as far back 
in time as the Neolithic age...In the Middle Ages in France, the work of bakers 
overlapped with that of the pastrycooks; bakers made gingerbread and meat, 
cheese, and vegetable pies...However, it was the Crusaders who gave a decisive 
impetus to patisseries, by discovering sugar cane and puff pastry in the East. 
This lead to pastrycooks, bakers, and restauranteurs all claiming the same 
products as their own specialties, and various disputes arose when one trade 
encroached upon the other...Another order, in 1440, gave the sole rights for 
meat, fish, and cheese pies to patisseries, this being the first time that the 
word appeared. Their rights and duties were also defined, and certain rules 
were established...In the 16th century, patissier products were still quite 
different from the ones we know today. Choux pastry is said to have been 
invented in 1540 by Popelini, Catherine de' Medici's chef, but the pastrycook's 
art only truly began to develop in the 17th century and greatest innovator at 
the beginning of the 19th century was indubitably [Antonin] Careme...There were 
about a hundred pastrycooks in Paris at the end of the 18th century. In 1986 
the count for the whole of France was over 40,000 baker-pastrycooks and 12,5000 
pastrycooks.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Jenifer Harvey Lang, 
editor [Crown:New York] 1988 (p. 777-8)</p> 
<p> &quot;The bakers of France made cakes too until one day in 1440 when a 
specialist corporation, the corporation of pastrycooks, deprived them of the 
right to do so. The pastrycooks had begun by making pies--meat pies, fish 
pies...Romans had known how to make a kind flaky pastry sheet by sheet, like 
modern filo pastry, but the new method of adding butter, folding and rolling 
meant that the pastry would rise and form sheets as it did so. Louis XI's 
favourite marzipan turnovers were made with flaky pastry...From the sixteenth 
century onwards convents made biscuits and fritters to be sold in the aid of 
good works...Missionary nuns took their talents as pastrycooks to the French 
colonies...&quot;<br>

[Barnes &amp; Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 242-244)</p> 
<p> &quot;Although the Paris pastry guild did not record its first 
constitution until 1440, there may well have been pastry specialties before 
that date. Once their guild was recognized, they began to expand the range of 
their production: in addition to meat pastries and tarts, they also created 
pastries out of milk, eggs, and cream, usually sweetened, such as darioles, 
flans, and dauphins. In order to become a master pastry maker in Le Mans in the 
early sixteenth century, one had to be able to use sugar loaves to make 
hypocras, a sweet, spiced wine used as an aperitif and after-dinner drink. It 
was not until 1566 that the king joined the Paris cookie makers guild to that 
of the pastry makers, and the two would be wedded frequently thereafter.&quot;

<p> <b>Frozen pie crusts?</b><br>
 Food historians laud Clarence Birdseye for 
launching the American frozen food industry. Fruits, veggies, fish were first 
offerings. Other foods followed in swift progression. Swanson and Morton 
pioneered the frozen pie market; concentrating savory selections [Chicken, 
Turkey, Beef].</p> 
<p> The earliest reference we find for frozen pie crust, as a stand-alone 
consumer retail product, appears in the mid-1950s. In 1955, a process for 
making frozen pie crust (rolled) was patented. This item was packaged in roll 
from; not as ready-to-bake tinned shells. This USA patent. was filed by Billie 
Hamilton Armstrong [TN] on June 4, 1954 and published December 6, 1955.</p> 
<p> Subsequent USA period ads do not describe frozen pie crusts. We have no 
way to know how the first frozen crusts were packaged: rolled &amp; destined 
for homemaker's own pie pans or pre-shelled &quot;ready to fill&quot; in 
disposable tins. In 1963 newspapers across America heralded a &quot;new&quot; 
frozen pie crust sold in 9-inch tins; without referencing brand or company. The 
year before, two companies rolled out new frozen pie crust products. Both were 
marketed to consumers in super markets. Pet-Ritz is generally credited for 
introducing shelled frozen pie crust products to the American public. Oronoque 
Orchards [Stratford CT], a local farm stand famous for its pies, may have 
actually eclipsed Pet-Ritz by a couple of months. Pet-Ritz took marketed their 
product nationally; Oronoque Orchards remained local. By the mid-'60s, frozen 
pie shells were ubiquitous.</p>

<p> &quot;Puncture-Free Pie Crust. Frozen pie crust has to be compounded 
carefully so as to resist tearing and puncturing between the time it is rolled 
and the time the housewife spreads it in the baking tin. Billie Hamilton 
Armstrong of Hohenwald, Tenn., has found a good proportion to be about two 
parts &quot;soft&quot; flour from summer-ripening wheat and one part 
&quot;hard&quot; flour from the winter vareity. She divides the batch into pats 
of about one pound each and then subdivides these into smaller bits, rolling 
them by hand to sheet form. This preliminary sheet is returned to pat form and 
rolled in a machine into pre-formed pie crusts about twelve to sixteen inches 
one-sixteenth of an inch thick. They got to the supermarket frozen, rolled in 
waxed paper and packed in light cardboard. Pie crusts prepared from dough made 
by her method, which is protected by Patent 2,726,156, &quot;have uniformly 
superiour characteristics,&quot; Mrs. Hamilton says, &quot;combining the 
essential factors for exceptional flakiness and delactable taste.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Pet-Ritz Pie Co. was started by the

pies to Michigan tourists. The success of the tourist business prompted the 
family to freeze pies and sell them. With the advent of modern mass production 
and freezing capabilities, Pet-Ritz Fruit Pies became one of the midwest's 
leading brands of frozen fruit pies...Because of consumer acceptance of frozen 
convenience products in the early 1960s, the Frozen Foods Division expanded 
into other product areas. One frozen product that has been very successful is

<p> <b>About puff paste</b><br>
 Food historians generally agree puff paste 
was an invention of Renaissance cooks. It was a natural iteration of shortcrust 
pastry. Early recipes were listed under various names. The term &quot;puff 
paste&quot; became standard in early 17th century English cooking texts.</p> 
<p> &quot;Puff paste is thought to have been perfected by the brilliant pastry 
chefs to the court of the dukes of Tuscany, perhaps in the fifteenth century. 
From there it made its was to the royal court of France, most likely brought by 
Marie de Medici.&quot;<br>

transcribed by Karen Hess [Columbia:New York] 1981 (page156)</p> 
<p> In England, puff paste was a natural iteration of short paste. Compare

<blockquote> <b>[1545] </b> <b>To make short paste for tart</b> <br>

<p> <b>[1596] &quot;To make butter paste</b><br>
 Take flour and seven or 
eight eggs, and cold butter and fair water, or rose water, and spices (if you 
will) and make your paste. Beat it on a board, and when you have so done divide 
it into two or three parts and drive out the piece with a rolling pin. And 
do['t] with butter one piece by another, and fold up your paste upon the butter 
and drive it out again. And so do five or six times together, and some not cut 
for bearings. Put them into the over, and when they be baked scrape sugar on 
them and serve them.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>[1615-1660] &quot;Of puff paste.</b><br>
 Now for the making of puff 
paste of the best kind, you shall take the finest wheat flour after it hath 
been a little baked in a pot in the oven, and blend it well with eggs, whites 
and yolks all together, after the paste is well kneaded, roll out a part 
thereof as thin as you please, and then spread cold sweet butter over the same, 
then upon the same butter roll another leaf of the paste as before; and spread 
it with butter also; and thus roll leaf upon leaf with butter between till it 
be as thick as you think good: and with it either cover any baked meat, or make 
paste for venison, Florentine, tart of what dish else you please and so bake 
it. There be some that to this paste use sugar, but it is certain it will 
hinder the rising thereof; and therefore when your puffed paste is baked, you 
shall dissolved sugar into rose-water, and drop it into the paste as much as it 
will by any means receive, and then set it a little while in the oven after and 
it will be sweet enough.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Pie crust</b>
<p> In its most basic definition, pie crust is a simple mix of flour and 
water. The addition of fat makes it pastry. In all times and places, the grade 
of the ingredients depends upon the economic status of the cook. Apicius [1st 
Century AD] makes reference to a simple recipe for crust (see below). Medieval 
cooking texts typically instruct the cook to lay his fruit or meat in a 
&quot;coffin,&quot; no recipe provided. Up through Medieval times, pie crust 
was often used as a cooking receptacle. It was vented with holes and sometimes 
marked to distinguish the baker/owner. Whether or not the crust was consumed or 
discarded is debated by food historians. Some hypothesize the crust would have 
been rendered inedible due to extreme thickness and baking time. Others observe 
flour, and by association flour-based products, was expensive and would not 
have been thrown away. Possibly? Pies baked in grand Medieval houses served two 
classes: the wealthy at the contents and the crust was given to the servants or 
poor.</p>
<p> &quot;Pies and tarts...In the Middle Ages, these sweet and savory 
preparations baked in a crust were the specialty of patissiers--who had no 
other functions...We know that medieval cooks did not always have ovens, and 
they worked with patissiers, to whom they sometimes brought fillings of their 
own making for the patissier to place in a crust and bake. This explains why 
cookbooks intended for professional chefs were nearly silent about the 
ingredients of these pastry wrappings, but spoke only about consistency an 
thickness, and about the most suitable shapes...Still, medieval cooks might 
take a chance and cook a simple pie or tart on their own by placing it in a 
shallow pan, covered with a lid and surrounded by live embers, whose progress 
they had to monitor very closely...In effect, the pastry because an oven, 
ensuring moderate heat thanks to its insulating properties...So could it be 
that these pastry coverings were not necessarily eaten once they had done their 
job of containing and protecting the fillings?&quot;<br>
 ---<i>The Medieval 
Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy</i>, Odile Redon et al, [University of 
Chicago Press:Chicago] 1998 (p. 133-4)</p> 
<p> Renaissance patissiers began experimenting with lighter, more malleable 
doughs. Recipes for short paste (&quot;short&quot; in this case means butter) 
andpuff paste enter cookbooks at this time. 17th century English cook books and 
reveal several recipes for pie crust and puff paste, all of varying thickness, 
taste and purpose. Robert May's<i>The Accomplisht Cook</i> [1685] listed 
fourteen separate recipes for paste (pastry/pie crust/puff paste). American 
cook books (<i>The Virginia Housewife</i>, Mary Randoph [1828] &amp; <i>
Directions for Cookery in its Various Branches</i>, Miss Leslie [1849]) contain 
instructions for making pies with puff paste, sometimes decorating them with 
cut out pieces of this same paste. Mrs. Randolph's recipe for pumpkin pudding (
pumpkin pie) states &quot;put a paste around the edges and in the bottom of a 
shallow dish or plate, pour in the mixture, cut some thin bits of paste, twist 
them and lay them across the top and bake it nicely.&quot; (University of South 
Carolina Press:Columbia] 1984 ( p. 154).<i>Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery 
Book</i> [1879] reads: &quot;Cranberry tart...line your plates with thin 
puff-paste, fill, lay strips of rich puff-paste across the top and bake in a 
moderate oven.&quot; (p. 299). There is no illustration to show us exactly how 
these strips looked.</p> 
<p> <b>In addition to being efficient cooking receptacles, covered pies 
promoted preservation:</b></p> 
<p> &quot;The idea of the covered pie. The modern biscuit is a descendant of 
the barley bannock and the oatcake which have come down to us from the 
beginning of civilization. It is a method of presering simply by reducing the 
water content of baked dough to such a degree that the product is not likely to 
be affected by mould; this is done, with the biscuit, in such a manner as to 
make chewing easy. The biscuit is thus the result of a successful fight against 
the dangers threatening normally fermented baked goods, mould, and staleness. 
The basic idea of the covered pie is a similar one. The covered pie is of very 
old standing in the British Isles, probably of longer standing than the modern 
biscuit. It has as a basis a similar dough to the biscuit, finely rolled out so 
that it can be thoroughly baked like a crust, but not caramelized like a 
bread-crust. Such a crust, especially when some fat has been added to the 
dough, is likely to withstand the influence of liquids and semi-liquids without 
becoming a sticky mess. If it is given an open pie-dish form, it can be used 
for filling with semi-liquids like minced meat or fruit, the whole thing is 
protected by the outer layer of the crust against certain contaminates and can 
be kept for quite a long time.&quot;<br>

are macerated with hone. Thereupon make dough crumbs of flour and oil. Lay the 
dough over or around the ham, stud the top with the pieces of the skin so that 
they will be baked with the dough and when done, retire from the oven and 
serve.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>American apple pie </b> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Recipes for apple pie (along with apples!) were brought to America by 
early European settlers. These recipes date back to Medieval times. This 14th 
century English book offersFor to Make Tartys in Applis. [NOTE: cofyn is a 
medieval word meaning pie crust!].About pie. </p> 
<p> &quot;The typical American pie made from uncooked apples, fat, sugar, and 
sweet spices mixed together and baked inside a closed pie shell descends from 
fifteenth-century English apple pies, which, while not quite the same, are 
similar enough that the relationship is unmistakable. By the end of the 
sixteenth century in England, apple pies were being made that are virtually 
identical to those made in America in the early twenty-first century. Apple 
pies came to America quite early. There are recipes for apple pie in both 
manuscript receipts and eighteenth-century English cookery books imported into 
the colonies.&quot;<br>

<p>  Most apple varieties originated in the Middle East. The fruit was 
introduced to Europe by the Roman legions. They were actively cultivated. 
Apples are considered one of America's symbols because they are prominently 
featured in recipes throughout our nation's history. About apples:</p> 
<p> &quot;The Romans introduced new economic plants. They had already 
developed several apple varieties, with fruits smaller than those of today but 
larger and sweeter than those borne by Britain's indigenous wild crabs...Their 
apple varieties included types for good keeping, and villa owers stored them 
spread out in rows in a dry, well-ventilated loft...Apples were sliced into two 
or three pieces with a red or bone knife (since metal stained the fruit), and 
were put to lie in the sun.&quot;(p. 325-6)...&quot;One of the earliest named 
apples was the pearmain, recorded soon after 1200. The copstard, a very large 
apple, was popular from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries. It was 
sold in the streets fo London by costermongers...By the fifteenth century 
pippins, pomewaters, bittersweets and blanderelles had become fashionable apple 
varieties. Several of the medieval apples were good keeping types; indeed, 
apples were preferred when they had been kept awhile and allowed to 
mellow.&quot; (p. 330-1)...Apples were pulped in the mortar and then put into 
tarts.&quot; (p. 334)<br>

<p> &quot;Apple. There were no native American apples when the first settlers 
arrived on these shores..The first apple seeds were brought by the Pilgrims in 
1620, and there were plantings in New Jersey as of 1632...In 1730 the first 
commercial apple nursery was opened on New York's Long Island, and by 1741 
applese were being shipped to the West Indies. The proliferation of the fruit 
into the western territories came by the hand of John Chapman, affectionately 
known asJohnny Appleseed. Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, in 1774, Chapman 
left his father's carpentry shop to explore the new territories...Apples were 
introduced to the Northwest by Captain Aemilius Simmons, who planted seeds at 
Fort Vancouver in Washington in 1824...&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Apple Pie<br>
 If something is said to be as &quot;American as apple 
pie,&quot; it is credited with being as American as &quot;The Star Spangled 
Banner.&quot; In fact, apples were brought from Europe to America, and apple 
pies (1780) were very popular in Europe, especially in England, before they 
came to epitomize Amerian food. But Americans popularized the apple pie as the 
country became the world's largest apple-producing nation.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>The 
Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani 
[Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 11)</p>
<p> &quot;The expression &quot;as American as apple pie&quot; wasn't the 
product of an overzealous imagination. Apple dishes of one kind or another 
could be found at practically every colonial meal, especially in New England. 
The apple was made into pies and fritters and puddings and slumps, literally a 
host of dishes. The colonists had inherited some of their taste for apples from 
the British along with many of the British recipes, but many other dishes were 
the products of American invention.&quot;<br>

<p>  Martha Washington's recipe: </p> 
<p> <i>Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery</i> (which was hand transcribed in 
the middle/late 17th century and in Mrs. Washington's possession) contains a 
recipe for an codling [apple] tarte. Note the archaic language (and lack of 
directions we now think of as *standard,* such as measurements and oven temps!):
</p> 
<blockquote> <b>[To Make] A Codling Tarte Eyther to Looke Clear or Green</b>

 [Ms. Hess adds these notes regarding codlings: &quot;Some

<p> <b>Why do some people serve cheddar cheese with apple pie?</b><br>
 The 
practice of combining cheese, fruit, and nuts dates back to ancient times. 
These were often served at the end of a meal because they were thought to aid 
in digestion. From the earliest days through the Renaissance, the partaking of 
these foods was generally considered a priviledge of the wealthy. This practice 
was continued by wealthy dinners composed of many courses up until the 19th 
century. Apples and cheesemaking were introduced to the New World by European 
settlers. These people also brought with them their recipes and love for 
certain combinations. This explains the popular tradition of apple pie and 
cheddar cheese in our country.</p> 
<p> &quot;The dark ages...The main meal was taken around the middle of the 
day...In the evening a light supper was taken and this was always finished with 
a little hard cheese, for digestion's sake. Gradually the large mid-day meal 
was later taken until that meal, wine-drinking and the cheese supper were 
combined. Thus was born the British habit of finishing an evening meal with 
cheese; almost every other society has eaten cheese before the sweet course to 
finish their main wine, or instead of a sweet.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Cheese: A Guide 
to the World of Cheese and Cheesemaking</i>, Bruno Battistotti et al [Facts on 
File Publications:New York] 1983 (p. 14-5)</p> 
<p> &quot;'After meat, [serve] pears, nuts, strawberries, wineberries and hard 
cheese, also blanderelles, pippins [apples].' All were considered hard or 
astringent, and therefore suitable to close up the stomache again after eating. 
Even so, apples and pears when taken at the end of the meal were usually 
roasted, and eaten with sugar, comfits, fennel seed or aniseed 'because of 
their ventosity.' Ordinary folk ate fruit as and when they could get it. The 
poor people in Piers Plowman sought to poison hunger with baked apples...&quot;

<p> <b>What about Mock Apple Pie?</b><br>
 Contrary to popular opinion, this 
dessert was not invented by Nabisco. Imitation apple pies made with soda 
crackers were the pride of thrifty 19th century American cooks. Nabisco 
introduced its Ritz Cracker version in 1935, on year after the product was 
introduced to the American public. It was an immediate hit.</p> 
<p> &quot;This recipe was all the rage when it first appeared in the 30s and 
remains popular in deepest heartland. To my great surprise, in leafing through 
late-nineteenth-century cookbooks, I found this Mock Apple Pie in<i>Mrs. Hill's 
Southern Practical Cookery and Receipt Book</i> [1872] </p> 
<blockquote>  One large grated lemon, three large soda crackers, two even 
tablespoons of butter, two teacups of sugar, one egg, a wineglass of water 
poured over the crackers. These will make two pies, baked with two crusts. 
</blockquote>  ...Mock Apple Pie may not be a wholly twentieth-century 
invention. But using Ritz Crackers is, because the National Biscuit Company 
introduced them only in November 1934...They were such a hit, National Biscuit 
took Ritz national in 1935...Because of their &quot;buttery&quot; richness, 
Ritz Crackers clearly make a finer Mock Apple Pie than ordinary soda 
crackers...&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Mock Apple Pie is Back. While the pundits debate the condition of 
the economy, 1,500 consumers a year have been clamoring for a recipe that is a 
holdover from the Depression. In response to their requests, the recipe for 
mock apple pie is back on boxes of Ritz crackers, after a 10-year hiatus. The 
pie is made with cracker crumbs, water, sugar, lemon juice, cream of tartar, 
margarine and cinnamon. It contains no apples, yet it tastes somethign like 
apple pie. A spokeswoman for Nabiso Brands said that decades ago, apples were 
not as readily available out of season and those that were available were 
expensive, accounting for the popularity of the mock apple pie. Actually, the 
recipe is a lot older than Ritz crackers. Pioneer families crossing the Great 
Plains in the 19th century also made pies like this when they ran out of fresh 
or dried apples, using apple juice or apple-cider vinegar in place of the lemon 
juice.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Apple Crisp &amp; Apple Brown Betty</b> 
<p> Tasty combinations of apples, spices, sweeteners and dough were known to 
ancient cooks. Medieval Europeans used apples frequently. They also perfected 
pie. When they settled in the New World, they brought their pie recipes (and
apples,  cinnamon, sugar,  oats &amp; wheat, butter, etc.) with them. Apple 
crisp (apple betty, apple slump, apple grunt, apple cobbler, apple pot pie, 
fried apple pies, apple pudding, apple pandowdy) descends from this culinary 
tradition.</p> 
<p> Apple crisp-type recipes (&amp; other &quot;non-traditional&quot; fruit 
pie variations such as cobbler) in the 19th century. Cookbook authors of these 
times note these recipes were regarded as quick family dishes, not meant for 
company or holidays. Certainly, pioneers traveling west would have found apple 
crisp (made with dried apples) a quick and delicious alternative to more 
complicated desserts.</p>

&quot;Apple Slump&quot; &amp; &quot;Brown Betty&quot; recipes were similar in

<p> </p> <b>Baklava &amp; filo</b>
<p> The history and origin of baklava, a popular Middle Eastern pastry that is 
made of many sheets of filo pastry laid flat in a pan and layered with sweet 
fillings, is commonly attributed to medieval Turkey.</p>
<p> &quot;Filo is the Greek name for a dough of many paper-thin layers 
separated by films of butter...Although known to Europeans and North Americans 
by a Greek name, the dough is clearly of Turkish origin. The medieval nomad 
Turks had an obsessive interest in making layered bread, possibly in emulation 
of the thick oven breads of city people. As early as the 11th century, a 
dictionary of Turkish dialects (Diwan Lughat al-Turk) recorded pleated/folded 
bread as one meaning of the word yuvgha, which is related to the word (yufka) 
which means a single sheet of file in modern Turkish. This love of layering 
continues among the Turks of Central Asia...The idea of making the sheets paper 
thins is a later development.The Azerbaijanis make the usual sort of baklava 
with 50 or so layers of filo, but they also make a...pastry called Baki 
pakhlavasi (Baku-style baklava) using ordinary noodle paste instead of 
filo...This may represent the earliest form of baklava, resulting form the 
Turkish nomads adapting their concept of layered bread--developed in the 
absence of ovens...If this is so, baklava actually pre-dated filo, and the 
paper-thin pastry we know today was probably an innovation of the Ottoman 
sultan's kitchens at Topkapi palace in Istanbul. There is an established 
connection between the Topkapi kitchens and baklava; on the 15th of Ramadan 
every year, the Janissary troops stationed in Istanbul used to march to the 
palace, where every regiment was presented with two trays of baklava. They

Procession.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;[Syrian] baklava are renowned thoughout the Near East. Some (called 
kol wa shkor) are made with extremely thin layers of filo pastry and have 
different shapes. Others are made with a type of birds nest' pastry, shaped in 
cylinders, called borma...All are filled with a mixture of nuts (pine nuts, 
hazelnuts, walnuts, pistachios can all be used), sugar, and rose or orange 
blossom water, baked, and then coated with sugar syrup.&quot;<br>
 ---Oxford 
Companion to Food (p. 446)</p>
<p> &quot;Persians, renowned patissiers since antiquity, invented the 
diamond-shaped Baklava which contained a nut stuffing perfumed with jasmine or 
pussy willow blossoms. In the sixth century the sweetmeat was introduced to the 
Byzantine court of Justinian I at Constantinople, where they Greeks discovered 
phyllo (thin pastry) and adopted the dessert which they serve today on New 
Year's and other joyous occasions.&quot;<br>

<p> Related foods? Mille feuille &amp; Napoleons! </p> 
<p> </p> <b>Napoleons</b> 
<p> The general concensus among the food history books is that napoleons, a 
popular flaky pastry dessert, were not named for the famous emperor. The name 
is thought to be a corruption of the word &quot;Napolitain,&quot; referring to 
a pastry made in the tradition of Naples, Italy. The pastry used for making 
napoleons is mille feuilles, literally meaning thousand leaves. While food 
historians place the creation of this mille feuilles in 19th century Europe, it 
might possibly be a descendant of filo, which was known to ancient middle 
eastern and Greek cooks. Filo is also composed of many layers or leaves. One of 
the most famous filo recipes isbaklava. </p> 
<p> &quot;Napoleons...have nothing to do with Bonaparte, the daring 
Corsican...The name is the result of a misunderstanding of the French word<i>
Napolitain</i> which should have been translated as Neopolitan pertaining to 
Naples. They are very much like the French mille-fueille or the Italian mille 
foglie both of which mean a thousand leaves.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Rare Bits: 
Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes,</i> Patricial Bunning Stevens [Ohio 
University Press:Athens] 1998 (p.202).</p> 
<p> &quot;Mille-Fueilles...The original cream-filled Mille-fueille or thousand 
leaf puff pastry was the probably creation of Careme, who may have used it as a 
grosse piece d'entremets to adorn a banquet table. It often goes by the name 
Napoleon, not out of respect for the corpulent corporal but as a corruption of 
Napolitain, referring to the Neapolitan manner of making sweets and ices in 
layers of alternating texture and color.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>The Horizon CookBook 
and Illustrated History of Eating and Drinking though the Ages,</i> William 
Harlan Hale [American Heritage:New York] 1968 (p. 685).</p> 
<p> &quot;Napolitains are large cakes which, like Breton and Savoie cakes, 
mille-feuilles and croquembouche, were once used to decorate elaborate buffets. 
In former times it was customary to place at each end of a table set for a 
large dinner party either and imposing decorated pastry or a heap of crayfish 
of other shellfish. This practice has now been abandoned; and although 
napolitains are still made, they are now usually small. The name of this cake 
suggests that it was created in Naples, but was this, in fact, the case? Or 
must we, as would seem more probable, ascribe its invention to Careme, who, as 
is generally known, at the time when he was making great set pieces, invented a 
certain number of large and magnificent pastries to which he himself gave the 
names which they bear today? It is a question to which no certain answer can be 
given.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Larousse Gastronomique,</i> Prosper Montagne, editor 
[Crown:New York] 1961 (p.653).</p> 
<p> &quot;Mille Feuilles, French for thousand leaves and a term for any of 
several items made from several layers of puff pastry...The invention of the 
form (but not of the pastry itself) is usually attribued to the Hungarian town 
of Szeged, and a caramel-coated mille feuilles is called Szegedinertorte. 
Careme, writing at the end of the 18th century, cautiously states only that it 
was of ancient origin...The most usual kind of mille fueilles is made of three 
layers of pastry baked in a rectangle shape, sandwiched with a cream filling 
containing nuts, or or some other cream or apricot jam, the top sprinkled with 
icing sugar...One particular oval type consisting of two layers joined around 
the edge, containing the same almond filling as gateau Pithiviers and iced with 
the same mixture diluted with egg white, is known in France as a 
&quot;Napoleon'--probably a corruption of &quot;Napolitain', from the 
Neapolitan habit of making layered confections. In the USA the name Napoleon' 
may be applied to any mille feuilles, and it is usually to to all kinds with 
royal icing.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson 
[Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 505)</p> 
<p> <b>About filo</b>: According to the food historians, filo/phyllo is of 
Turkish origin. One of the most popular foods made with this kind of dough is
Baklava. </p> 
<p> <b> The Careme connection?</b><br>
 Careme is generally regarded as the 
father of all modern French pastries. Ian Kelly's<i>Cooking for Kings: The Life 
of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef</i> includes a (modernized, 
translated) recipe for Gateau Pithvieir, attributed to Careme circa 1805 (p. 
261). It is not so very different from modern Napoleons. La Varenne's<i>French 
Cook</i> (we have the English version, circa 1653 published by Southover Press 
c. 2001) does not offer a recipe for Napolitains. It does, however offer 
several general instructions for pastry making (p. 192). It also offers recipes 
for two layered tortes: Tourte of Franchipanne (p. 200) and Tourte of Massepin 
[marzipan aka almond paste] (p. 201). It is interesting to note [but not 
necessarily connected] that Marie-Antoine Careme [1783-1833], the famous french 
pastry chef who managed Tallyrand's kitchens, was a contemporary of Napoleon I 
[1769-1821].</p>

 &quot;Napolitain</b><br>
<i>Ingredients. For a large 
napolitain:</i> 2 1/4 cups (365 grams) blanched sweet almonds; 1 tablepsoon (12 
1/2 grams) blanched bitter almonds; 1 14 cups (175 grams) fine sugar; 1/2 pound 
(250 grams) butter; 4 cups (500 grams) sieved cake flour; 1 3/4 cups (30 grams) 
sugar flavoured with lemon (or any other flavouring); a pinch of salt.</p> 
<p> <i>Method.</i> Pound the almonds in a mortar with a little white of egg to 
bind them. When the almonds are pounded to a fine paste, add the fine sugar, 
the flavoured sugar, the butter and flour. Pounding constantly, add as many 
whole eggs as are required to make a very smooth and rather stiff paste. Take 
this paste out of the mortar and leave to stand for a while in a cool place. 
Roll out the paste. Cut it into square, round or hexagonal pieces. With a 
pastry cutter 2 inches in diameter, cut out the middle of each piece, except 
for two which will serve for the top and bottom layer of cake. Bake these 
layers of pastry in a hot oven. When the layers are quite cold spread each one 
with a different fruit puree or jelly. Put the layers one on top of the other, 
using an uncut layer to form the base, with alternate layers of jam or jelly. 
Cover with the other uncut layer. When the cake is built up, coat with golden 
apricot jam and pipe with royal icing.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Black bottom pie</b>
<p> Food historians tell us chocolate cream pie, as we know it today, was 
introduced in the last decades of the 19th century. The earliest versions were 
topped with meringue or a thin layer of whipped cream, creating a &quot;black 
bottom&quot; of sorts. Early prototypes were baked in standard pastry shells 
and served room temperature.</p> 
<p> Recipes titled &quot;Black Bottom&quot; surface in early 20th century. 
They were hailed as 'novel' in the 1920s. Modern chilled versions coincide with 
the introduction of &quot;icebox&quot; (aka refrigerator) desserts. These new 
desserts typically incorporated commercially prepared items. In the case of 
pie, standard pastry shells were replaced by crushed cookie or graham cracker 
crusts. As time progressed, ratio of chocolate filling to white topping 
flipped. Some versions introduce a layer in between. Aboutrefrigerator pie. </p>
<p> Food historians generally associate &quot;Black Bottom Pie&quot; with 
Southern USA cuisine. Our research confirms this is true, but not in the place 
most folks expect. Latitude-wise. Our survey of historic USA newspapers suggest 
&quot;Black Bottom Pie&quot; originated in southern California (Los Angeles). 
Variations slowly rolled eastward (via Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Florida) to 
the Atlantic shore where they were embraced without question. None of our 
Southern cookbooks published in 1930s contain &quot;Black Bottom&quot; recipes.
</p> 
<p> <b>This is what the food historians say: </b><br>
 &quot;'I think this is 
the most delicious pie I have ever eaten,' exclaimed Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings 
in her 1942 kitchen narrative,<i>Cross Creek Cookery</i>...Duncan Hines, the 
wandering hotel and restaurant scout from Kentucky, published an almost 
identical black bottom pie in his<i>Adventures in Good Cooking</i> in the early 
1940s, having found the dessert in a restaurant in Oklahoma City, but it isn't 
clear whether his discovery receded Mrs. Rawlings' or drew its inspiration from 
hers. James Beard, in his American Cookery, said black bottom pie 'began 
appearing in cookbooks around the turn of the century,' but he cited none; it 
wasn't in Fannie Farmer's magnum opus or Joy of Cooking until after Rawlings 
and Hines published it. But the story of its origin has been lost, the basic 
formula for its unique combinations of flavors is safe--and certain to remain 
with us. Let it suffice to say that black bottom is a Southern pie that has 
been spreading joy in and out of the region for close to fifty years or 
more.&quot;<br>

Carolina Press:Chapel Hill] 1993 (p. 328-329)</p> 
<p> &quot;Certain recipes are destined to catch the public fancy and become 
classics, though not necessarily right away. One such recipe is Black Bottom 
Pie...appears not to have caught on, however, until the late 1930s when Duncan 
Hines, author of America's trusted Adventures in Good Eating, made note of 
it...Later Hines would recall Black Bottom Pie as &quot;one of those marvelous 
creations that has somehow managed to keep its light under a bushel.&quot; In 
1940<i>The Good Housekeeping Cook Book</i> and <i>Woman's Home Companion Cook 
Book</i> both printed recipes for Black Bottom Pie...One of Black Bottom Pie's 
biggest fans was Floridian Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, author of the Yearling,

on Black Bottom Pie in his classic book<i>Pie Marches On</i>. He prefaced the 
recipe with these headnotes: &quot;This is without doubt the most sensational 
pie that has ever been introduced, and is one of the outstanding originals of 
the writer. Aside from being a sensation, I believe it brought the highest 
price that any pie ever sold at commercially; $1.90 for a nine inch pie retail, 
and the volume in which it sold made pie history. This pie was written up by 
newspapers and magazines all over the country, and on these pages the recipe is 
published for the first time. Those who were among the fortunate few to obtain 
this recipe guarded it very closely, and it is my prediction that it will be 
the outstanding pie in this book. The sensation was not in the pie alone, but 
in its design and make-up, as well as the crust beneath it. On this pie was 
first introduced the Graham Cracker Crust and, of course, we will start with 
the crust.&quot;---<i>Pie Marches On</i>, Monroe Boston Strause [Ahrens

 &quot;Black Bottom Pie. </b><br>
 I think this is the most 
delicious pie I have ever eaten. The recipe form which I first made it was sent 
me by a generous correspondent, and originated at an old hotel in Louisiana. It 
seemed to me it could be no better. Then another correspondent sent me a recipe 
for Black Bottom Pie that varied in some details from the first one. Having 
tried both, I now combine the two to make a pie so delicate, so luscious, that 
I hope to be propped up on my dying bed and fed a generous portion. The I think 
that I should refuse outright to die, for life would be too good to relinquish. 
The pie seems fussy to make, but once a cook gets the hang of it, it goes 
easily.<br>
<b>Crust </b><br>
 14 crisp ginger cookies <br>
 5 tablespoons 
melted butter<br>
 Roll the cookies fine. Mix with the melted butter. Line a 
nine-inch pie tin, sides and bottom, with the buttered crumbs, pressing flat 
and firm. Bake ten minutes in a slow oven to set.<br>
<b>Basic Filling </b><br>

 1 3/4 cups milk<br>
 1 tablespoon cornstarch <br>
 4 tablespoon gelatine <br>
 
1/2 cup sugar<br>
 4 egg yolks <br>
 Pinch of salt <br>
<b>For Chocolate Layer
</b> <br>
 2 squares melted chocolate <br>
 1 teaspoon vanilla <br>
<b>For 
Rum-Flavored Layer</b><br>
 4 egg whites <br>
 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar <br>
 1/2 cup sugar<br>
 1 tablespoon rum <br>
<b>Topping </b><br>
 2 tablespoons 
confectioners' sugar<br>
 1 cup whipping cream <br>
 Grated chocolate <br>
 
Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Scald the nilk, add one-half cup sugar 
mixed with the cornstarch, pinch of salt, then beaten egg yolks. Cook in double 
boiler, stirring constantly, until custard thickens and will coat the back of 
the spoon. Stir in the dissolved gelatine. Divide custard in half. To one-half 
add the melted chocolate and the vanilla. Turn while hot into the cooled crust, 
dipping out carefully so as not to disturb the crust. Let the remaining half of 
the custard cool. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar, adding one-half cup 
of sugar slowly. Blend with the cooled custard. Add one tablespoon rum. Spread 
carefully over the chocolate layer. Place in ice box to chill thoroughly. It 
may even stand over-night. When ready to serve, whip the heavy cream stiff, 
adding two tablespoons confectioners' sugar slowly. Pile over the top of the 
pie. Sprinkle with grated bitter or semi-sweet chocolate.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Boston cream pie</b>
<p> There are some questions regarding the history Boston cream pie [Not! To 
be confused with Boston Favorite Cake or Boston Pudding]. This is not an 
uncommon occurrance in the world of culinary history.</p>
<p> &quot;Boston cream pie. A pie made of white cake and custard filling or 
topping. If chocolate icing is added, it is called &quot;Parker House chocolate 
pie,&quot; after the Parker House in Boston, Massachusetts, where the 
embellishment was first contrived. The pie goes back to early American history, 
when it was sometimes called &quot;Pudding-cake pie,&quot; or, when made with a 
raspberry jelly filling, &quot;Mrs. Washington's pie,&quot; The first mention 
of the dessert as &quot;Boston cream pie&quot; was in the New York Herald in 
1855.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, John F. 
Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 37)</p>
<p> The <i>Boston Globe</i> reprinted the original Parker House recipe a few 
years ago:</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;Boston cream pie was invented by Monsieur Sanzian, a French 
pastry chef hired in 1855 by the former Parker House (now the Omni Parker 
House). Executive chef Joseph Ribas, who has been with the hotel for 27 years, 
says Sanzian invented it &quot;because he was topping an English cream cake 
with chocolate. He started to play around with the recipe, put almonds around 
the outside, and the guests loved it....
<p> THE ORIGINAL BOSTON CREAM PIE </p> 
<p> According to research conducted by Stephanie Seacord, former director of 
public relations for the Omni Parker House, the original Boston cream pie had 
only two layers. Ribas's version, however, consists of three layers of 
spongecake, which are soaked with rum syrup, spread with 
whipped-cream-lightened custard, topped with chocolate and vanilla icing, and 
garnished with toasted sliced almonds. This recipe makes 4 cups of custard 
filling, a fine amount if you're going to cut the cake into three layers. If 
you plan to cut the cake into two layers, however, I recommend making a half 
portion of the pastry cream.</p> 
<p> <b>For the pastry cream:</b> <br>
 1 tablespoon butter <br>
 2 cups milk 
<br> 2 cups light cream <br>
 1/2 cup sugar <br>
 3 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 
<br> 6 eggs <br>
 1 teaspoon dark rum </p> 
<p> <b>For the chocolate fondant icing: </b><br>
 2 cups sugar <br>
 1/8 
teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
 1 cup water <br>
 3 ounces semisweet chocolate 
<br> 1/2 cup sliced almonds </p> 
<p> <b>For the cake: </b><br>
 7 eggs <br>
 1 cup sugar <br>
 1 cup flour <br>

 2 tablespoons butter, melted<br>
 To make the pastry cream, combine the 
butter, milk, and light cream in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring 
just to a boil. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Add 
the eggs and beat until ribbons form, about 5 minutes. Whisk into the hot-milk 
mixture and bring to a boil, whisking constantly (to prevent the eggs from 
scrambling) until the mixture has thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl 
and cover the surface with plastic wrap (to keep a skin from forming). 
Refrigerate for several hours. Whisk in the rum.</p> 
<p> To make the chocolate fondant icing, wipe a large cookie sheet (or marble 
slab) with a damp cloth. Combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and water in a 
heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to 
dissolve the sugar. Cover and let boil for 3 minutes. Uncover and dip a pastry 
brush in cold water to wash down the sides of the pot; boil until the syrup 
reaches the soft-ball stage (238 degrees), about 5 minutes. Remove from the 
heat and pour onto the damp cookie sheet. Let it cool for 10 minutes, or until 
lukewarm. Using a metal spatula, spread the sugar mixture out and turn it over 
on itself until it starts to thicken and whiten. (It may be easier to knead the 
mixture with your hands.) Continue kneading the sugar mixture until it is very 
stiff. Scrape it off the sheet, place in an airtight container, and refrigerate 
for several hours. To make the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly 
grease a 10-inch springform pan. Separate the eggs, putting the whites in one 
medium bowl and the yolks in another. Add 1/2 cup of sugar to each bowl. Beat 
the egg whites until they form stiff peaks; beat the egg yolks until they are 
thick and pale yellow in color, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the stiff egg 
white mixture into the yolk mixture.</p> 
<p> Gradually fold in the flour and then fold in the melted butter. Pour the 
batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a 
cake tester comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake. Let 
cool. To assemble, heat 3/4 cup of the fondant and the chocolate in a double 
boiler until warm. Stir to a spreading consistency, adding a little water as 
necessary. Using a long serrated knife, slice the cake into 2 layers. Spread 
the pastry cream over the bottom layer, reserving approximately 1 cup of pastry 
cream to spread around the sides of the cake (to help the almonds adhere). 
Place the second layer of cake over the pastry cream and spread the reserved 
pastry cream around the sides of the cake. Top with the chocolate icing (work 
rapidly, since the icing sets very quickly) and press the almonds around the 
sides. Serve immediately at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to 2 days 
and bring to room temperature before serving. (When refrigerated, the fudgelike 
icing becomes quite heavy and stiff.) Serves 10.<br>

Boston Cream Pie,&quot;<i>The Boston Globe</i>, July 2, 1997, p. E1 </p> 
</blockquote> We searched our 19th century cookbooks for Boston cream pie. As 
Mr. Mariani noted, we found several recipes [with various names] that would 
probably produce similar results. The earliest recipe we found in print with 
with the word &quot;Boston&quot; in the title is dated 1882:
<p></p> 
<blockquote> <b>&quot;Boston Cream Cakes.</b> <br>
 1/2 lb butter <br>
 3/4 lb 
flour<br>
 8 eggs <br>
 1 pint water 
<p> Stir the butter into the water, which should be warm, set it on the fire 
in a saucepan, and slowly bring to a boil, stirring it often. When it boils, 
put in the flour, boil one minute, stirring all the while; take from the fire, 
turn into a deep dish, and let it cool. Beat the eggs very light, and whip into 
this cooled paste, first the yolks, then the whites. Drop, in great spoonfulls, 
upon buttered paper, taking care not to let then touch or run into each other, 
and bake ten minutes.</p> 
<p> <b>Cream for filling</b><br>
 1 quart milk<br>
 4 tablespoons corn-starch
<br> 2 eggs<br>
 2 cups sugar </p> 
<p> Wet the corn-starch with enough milk to work it into a smooth paste. Boil 
the rest of the milk. Beat the eggs, add the sugar and corn-starch to these, 
and so soon as the milk boils pour in the mixture gradually, stirring all the 
time until smooth and thick. Drop in a teaspoonful of butter, and when this is 
mixed in, set the custard aside to cool. Then add vanilla or lemon seasoning; 
pass a sharp knife lightly around the puffs, split them, and fill with the 
mixture. The best cream cakes I have ever tasted were made by this somewhat odd 
receipt. Try it.&quot;<br>

</blockquote> It it interesting to note the the first <i>Boston Cooking School 
Cook Book</i>, Mrs. D.A. Lincoln [1884] DOES NOT contain a recipe for Boston 
pie or Boston cream cakes. This book DOES contain several recipes using custard 
and cream [most notably Bavarian cream] fillings for cakes [plain, sponge], 
pies and pastry [cream puffs, lady fingers, trifles]. These were very popular 
both in America and abroad. If you want to inspect these recipes ask your 
librarian can help you find a copy of this book. It was reprinted in 1996 
[Dover Publications/paperback] and is available full-text online. Take a look at

<p> </p> <b>Cannoli</b>
<p> Fried foods are associated with Christian Carnival (aka Mardi Gras) fare 
throughout Europe from Medieval times forward. Sicilian cannoli descend from 
this tradition. Classic Sicilian cannoli is filled with ricotta. Americanized 
versions are sometimes filled with sweet custard or whipped cream. Mostly 
because Anglo-American palates expect (require?) familiar creamy sweet fillings 
in their pastries.</p>
<p> &quot;Cannolo (or cannoli, the plural form more familiar in N. America), a 
Sicilian sweetmeat made from flour, mixed with Marsala, cinnamon, cocoa, egg, 
and a mixture of water and vinegar (which is said to keep it crisp). The thinly 
rolled dough, cut in circles, is wrapped around metal tubes and deep fried. 
When cool, the connolo is filled with sweetened ricotta, chocolate chips, and 
candied orange peel, or liqueur-flavoured ricotta in which case the ends are 
dipped in chocolate nuts. These cakes are made for carnival, in February.&quot;

<p> &quot;Cannoli...The convents of Sicily are the great repositories of 
Arab-influenced desserts, the so-called dolci de badia, or abbey 
sweets...sweets from the Convento di Santa Caterina on Piazza Bellini in 
Palermo, where they make cannoli... The great Sicilian gastronome...Alberto 
Denti di Pirajno proposed a theory as to how the convents became home for so 
many Arab-influenced sweets. During Arab rule in Sicily (827-1091), the inland 
town of Caltanissetta was called Qal'at al-nissa, the castle of women, because 
of the fame of the harem of the emir of that city. In the hours when they 
awaited their masters, the women prepared sweets and cakes. After the Normans 
conquered Caltanissettta, the harems disappeared by the Muslims did not. They 
were driven into the mountains, and some converted--perhaps the women found 
refuge as crypto-Muslim nuns in the convents, bringing their secret 
recipes...to be handed down through the confines of the convents.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;...the king of Carnival is the cannolo, which in its plural form, 
cannoli, is now part of the American language...To be good, cannoli have to be 
very fresh (the best coffee houses and bars in Palermo offer cannoli 
espress--filled while you wait), so if you are a cannoli fan and you can get 
good ricotta, it is worth the effort to make them at home.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>About ricotta</b><br>
 &quot;Ricotta is an Italian cottage cheese made 
originally from the whey left after making other cheeses--from cow's, ewe's, or 
even goat's milk--but nowadays often with full or skimmed milk added. It is 
widely used in Italian cookery: applications include fillings for ravioli and 
cannelloni, cheesecakes, and ice cream. Its name means literally 'recooked', 
from the method of manufacture; it goes back to Latin recocta, feminine past 
participle of recoquere, cook again.'&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A to Z of Food and 
Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 282) </p> 
<p> &quot;Ricotta is known as an albumin or serum cheese, a cheese made as a 
by-product of provolone cheese from the recooked whey, hence the name, ricotta, 
&quot;recooked.&quot; Ricotta cheese, which is generally recognized as having 
been invented in Sicily, is known in the language of the island by another 
name: zammataru, a word in Sicilian meaning &quot;dairy farmer.&quot; This word 
is derived form the Arabic za'ama, meaning &quot;cow,&quot; leading to the 
supposition that ricotta might have had its origins in the Arab-Sicilian era. 
The Greek antiquarian who wrote volumes on food, Atheneus (c. A.D. 170-230), 
talks about &quot;tender cheese&quot; at a banquet. We don't know if this is 
ricotta, but he also mentions a cheese from Sicily that was well known. Two of 
the earliest mentions or depictions of ricotta are related to Sicily. Professor 
Santi Correnti, chairman of the history department of the University of Catania 
and a preeminent historian of Sicily, told me that during the reign of the 
Sicilian king Frederick II, in the early thirteenth century, the king, and his 
hunting party came across the hut of a dairy farmer making ricotta and, being 
ravenous, asked for some. Frederic pulled out his bread loaf, poured the hot 
ricotta and when you top, and advised his retinue that &quot;Cu; non manica 
ccu' so' cucchiaru lassa tutto o zammatary&quot; (Those who don't eat with a 
spoon will leave all their ricotta behind). The first depiction of the making 
of ricotta is an illustration in the medical treatise known as the Tacuinum 
sanitas (medival health handbook), the Latin translation of Ibn Butlan's 
eleventh-century Taqwim al-sihha.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>A Mediterranean Feast</i>, 
Clifford A. Wright [William Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 467)</p> 
<p> &quot;Salted ricotta belongs to all the summer; from October to May 
ricotta is eaten fresh, both as a cheese and as the basis of Sicilian 
confectionery. We have already met sweetened ricotta mixed with cuccia, and 
while the renowned cannoli and the cassate siciliane with their ricotta cream 
fillings belong not to the classical but to a later period in Sicilan history, 
this is the place for a recipe that uses sugar and ricotta in a different 
fashion.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Chess pie</b>
<p> Chess pie (also known as chess cake, chess tart, &amp; sugar pie) belongs 
to a long Southern American tradition of sweet egg-rich custard pies. Popular 
culinary folklore offers several interesting explanations for the name of this 
recipe. The most plausible is the connection between it and 17th century 
English cheeseless cheesecakes. Foodways expert Karen Hess confirms:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;Since the archaic spellings of cheese often had but one 
&quot;e&quot; we have the answer to the riddle of the name of that southern 
favorite &quot;Chess Pie,&quot; recipes for which vary no more from that for 
&quot;Transparent Pudding&quot; than those do among themselves; &quot;Chess 
Cake: is also akin, if less directly. (The tradition of making cheesecake 
without the cheese goes back to early seventeenth century and beyond...)&quot;
<br> --- <i>The Virginia House-wife</i>, Mary Randolph, with Historical Notes 
and Commentaries by Karen Hess [University of South Carolina Press:Columbia SC] 
1984 (p. 289)</blockquote> 
<p> About  cheesecake and custard. </p> 
<p> &quot;The Southern chess pie carries and old--even ancient--tradition of 
puddings and pastries with the rich texture of cheese. &quot;Chess&quot; is 
probably derived from the word &quot;cheese,&quot; although various other 
theories have arisen about the origin of the name. Elizabeth Hedgecock Sparks, 
author of<i> North Carolina and Old Salem Cookery</i>, says it is &quot;an old, 
old tart which may have obtained its name from the town of Chester, 
England.&quot; Others believe that &quot;chess&quot; is a corruption of the 
world &quot;chest&quot; (as in a pie chest) where pies are often kept. Then 
there is the story about the cook who was asked what she put in the pie, and 
she replied, &quot;Anything in our chest.&quot; Or the one who was asked about 
the kind of pie. The answer was &quot;Oh, jes' pie.&quot; The cheese etymology 
seems the most likely one, because in old cookbooks, cheesecakes and pies that 
were sometimes made with cheese sometimes without (referring to cheese in the 
textural sense--lemon card, for example, is often referred to as lemon cheese), 
are often included in a single category. A selection of cheeseless 
&quot;cheese&quot; pastries in<i>Housekeeping in Old Virginia</i> (1879) are 
made with egg yolks, sugar, butter, milk, and lemon juice--very much like chess 
pie filling. Sometimes called &quot;Cheesecake Pudding&quot; (the filling is 
made of yolks, brown sugar, butter, nutmeg, and brandy or rum) is baked in a 
crust in small tins...&quot;<br>

Belk [Simon and Schuster:New York] 1991 (p. 367-8)<br>
 [NOTE: this author 
observes &quot;sugar pies&quot; were chess pies made with white sugar, 
&quot;brown sugar pies&quot; were the same recipe made with brown sugar and 
&quot;Osgood&quot; pies included raisins.]</p> 
<p> &quot;Chess pie is the classic Southern pastry, rich, sweet, and intense. 
The name is a corruption of cheese, for in the British culinary tradition eggs 
and cheese share the same terminology...The Oxford English Dictionary says a 
cheesecake is &quot;a cake or tart of light pastry, orginally containing 
cheese; now filled with a yellow butterlike compound of milk-curds, sugar, and 
butter, or a preparation of whipped egg and sugar.&quot; The Southern version 
is the latter...The classic chess pie is pointed up with vanilla and/or nutmeg. 
Lemon chess, perhaps the favorite, receive just enough citrus flavor to name, 
but not dominate, the custard...Variations on the chess theme are Brown Sugar 
Pie, and with nuts, Pecan Pie.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Chiffon pie</b>
<p> General concenus of American food historians is chiffon pie (chocolate 
&amp; other flavors) first surfaced in the United States during the 1920s. 
Precursors can be found under different names. The ultimate underlying 
inspriation is probably meringue:

<p> <b> Who gets the credit for &quot;inventing&quot; the chiffon pie?</b><br>

 Monroe Boston Strause. In Clementine Paddleford's own words:</p> 
<p> &quot;Monroe Boston Strause, pie engineer. Here is the man who invented 
chiffon pie--and his recipe...Fruit-fragrant chiffon will be the pie star on 
the menus of tomorrow, is the prediction of Monroe Boston Strause, number-one 
pie engineer of the nation. And pie man Strause ought to know: Commercial 
bakers in 48 states look to him as style leader in the building of America's 
favorite dessert. Monroe Boston Strause has a weakness for that pie called 
chiffon; it's an invention all his own. But chiffon pies postwar will have a 
different kind of thickening from those of today. Cornstarch is being outmoded 
by new gelatinizing agents, tasteless, clear as glass, that can be combined 
with the filling without beating. Fresh fruit chiffons will taste like fresh 
fruit. It was in 1921 that ambitious, redheaded Monroe Strause, 16, went into 
the business with an uncle who fancied himself a pie baker. Cream pies were 
Uncle Mike's specialty--stiff with cornstarch. Monroe couldn't bear the sight 
of them, let alone promote their sale...Determined to make his first business 
venture succeed, the youngster began fooling around with pie fillings. He 
started with a recipe for the French cream used in eclairs in which boiled 
sugar syrup is added to beaten egg whites, then the cornstarch filling folded 
into this. Anything for lightness, so Monroe began piling in the egg whites. 
First thing he knew he had a filling ethereal. This creation he carried home to 
show off to his mother. 'Why, it looks just like a pile of chiffon,' she said. 
So the pie was christened. Mere piecrust seemed unworthy support for such a 
delicate dainty. Monroe's mother suggested graham crackers for a shell. Then 
crumb crusts were unknown. More experimentation. Eventually a shell light, 
crisp, tender--the ideal mate for chiffon. Monroe's first chiffon pies sold as 
a restaurant novelty, 35 cents a thin wedge. Within three years he boasted the 
largest pie business in the West. Bakers from everywhere were asking, 'How did 
you do it?' Monroe sold his pie company to be a pie engineer. Anyone, he clams, 
can turn out a chiffon nothing short of perfection by following his blueprint 
directions:</p>

<p> <b>What is chiffon?</b><br>
 &quot;Chiffon. A very light, sweet fluffy 
filling for a pie, cake, or pudding. The word is from the French, meaning 
&quot;rag,&quot; and ultimately the Middle English word for &quot;chip,&quot; 
as chiffon also refers to pieces of sheer, delicate ribbon or fabric for 
women's clothing. Chiffon pie is first mentioned in American print in 1929 as a 
&quot;chiffon pumpkin pie,&quot; in the<i>Beverly Hills Women's Club's Fashions 
in Food</i>. The 1931 edition of Irma S. Rombauer's <i>Joy of Cooking</i> gave 
a recipe for lemon chiffon.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Encylopedia of American Food and 
Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 74) </p> 
<p> &quot;Chiffon Pie. My research tells me that these fluffy unbaked pies 
debuted in the early 1920s as &quot;souffle&quot; or &quot;gelatin&quot; pies. 
A headnote to the Eggnog Chiffon Pie recipe in<i>Woman's Day Old Fashioned 
Desserts</i> (1978) says that &quot;Chiffon pies were invented in 1921 by a 
professional baker who lived in Iowa. By beating egg whites with a 
fruit-flavored syrup until the mixture was light and fluffy, he achieved a 
filling that his mother said looked like a pie of &quot;chiffon.&quot; It's a 
story I've been unable to substantiate. Besides, Knox Gelatine's 1915 booklet,
<i>Dainty Desserts for Dainty People</i>, features gelatin &quot;sponges,&quot; 
&quot;marshmallow puddings,&quot; and &quot;marshmallow creams&quot;--the airy 
mixes that would one day emerge as chiffon fillings...Searches of several dozen 
early-twentieth-century cookbooks turn up a few &quot;souffle&quot; and 
&quot;sponge&quot; pies, but these contained no gelatin and/or whipped cream. 
They were baked pies with stiffly beaten egg whites folded in just before they 
went into the oven...The earliest fluffy gelatin pies that I was able to locate 
both appeared in<i>Good Housekeeping's Book of Menus, Recipes and Household 
Discoveries</i>. The date: 1922. The first, Coffee Souffle Pie, qualifies on 
all counts as a chiffon pie...The second Good Housekeeping recipe, Pineapple 
Gelatin Pie, contains gelatin and heavy cream...but no egg whites. Still, it is 
very chiffonlike. Leafing through 1930s cookbooks, I find four chiffon pies in
<i>My Better Homes &amp; Gardens Cook Book</i> (1939); lemon, chocolate, 
pineapple, and pumpkin. All begin with a gelatin &quot;custard,&quot; are 
fluffed with stiffly peaking egg whites, and, in the case of the pineapple, 
with whipped cream as well. Here too, the crusts are the standard pastry, baked 
and cooled (crumb-crusted cvhiffon pies come later--with pies such as 
grasshopper...and Black Bottom..). Two 1940 cookbooks featured a great variety 
of chiffon pies:<i>Women's Home Companion Cook Book</i> (with ninteen) and the 
<i>Good Housekeeping Cook Book</i> (with thirteen). Despite World War II sugar 
shortages, chiffon pies surged into popularity during '40s, driven perhaps by<i>
The Joy of Cooking</i>, which devoted a special section to them. Chiffon pies 
remained popular right through the '70s. Then in the 1980s when salmonella 
began compromising the wholesomeness of our eggs, they fell from favor. But 
only briefly. Savvy food manufacturers discovered that powdered egg whites, 
cream cheese, whipped toppings, and marshmallow cream could double nicely for 
raw egg whites. Thus, '90s chiffon pies are likely to contain no eggs at all. 
And sometimes no gelatin. There's usually no stinting, however, on whipped 
cream.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Lemon Chiffon Filling</b><br>
 First place on the 
stove and bring to a boil:<br>
 1 quart water<br>
 12 oz. sugar<br>
 1/4 oz. 
salt<br>
 3/4 oz. grated lemon rind<br>
 2 or 3 drops lemon color<br>
 Bring 
this to a boil and thicken with 5 ounces of cornstarch dissolved in 6 ounces of 
fresh lemon juice. After the cornstarch solution has been added, cook until 
thick. Next place in the cake machine 1 pint of egg whites and 1/2 pound of 
sugar and beat dry stiff. Then add an additional half pound of sugar to the 
beaten egg whites and continue beating the whites until this last part of the 
sugar is thoroughly dissolved. This will only take a few revolutions of the 
machine. Remove the beaten egg whites from the cake machine bowl and place them 
in a round-bottom mixing bowl. The pour the cooked part over the beaten egg 
whites and with a wire-hand whip fold together easily but well. The filling 
whould be placed in the shell immediately. Do not allow to stand. Fill the 
shell generously full and with a spatula pyramid to the center of the pie, 
making the center higher than the sides. Allow to cool and top with whipped 
cream. It is very important that the cooked portion of the mix be thickened 
after the egg whites have been properly beaten, and they must then be folded 
together immedatiely. If the cooked portion of the mix is allowed to stand 
waiting for the egg whites to attain the proper stiffness, a skin will form, 
and on folding this mix into the egg whites, a lumpy filling will result. 
Smoothness and texture are important to the successful chiffon pie. Soft or 
underbeaten egg whites will cause the pie to be soft and runny, and the 
definition of 'dry stiff' in this case means beating the egg whites beyond any 
stiffness that you would consider using for a meringue.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Cobbler</b> 
<p> Cobbler is an amalgam of European tradition and American ingenuity. 
According to the food historians, cobbler (peach, apple, plum, cherrry, etc.) 
originated in the American West during the second half of the 19th century. It 
was a deep-dish thick, quick crust filled with whatever fruit (fresh, canned, 
dried) was on hand. Necessity required westward-bound pioneer cooks to adapt 
traditional oven-baked pie recipes to quick biscuit treats that could be cooked 
in Dutch ovens.Pot pie is a closely related recipe. </p> 
<p> <b>Why call it cobbler?</b><br>
 Our dictionaries, word history books and 
food history reference sources generally agree the term cobbler, as it applies 
to a fruit dessert covered with rough biscuit dough, originated in the American 
west in the middle of the 19th century. Where did the name come from? Most of 
our books simply state &quot;source unknown.&quot;<i>The Barnhart Dictionary of 
Etymology</i>/Barnhart adds: &quot;A kind of pie baked in a deep dish,. 1859, 
American English, but perhaps ultimately related to, or even developed from 
unrecorded use of cobeler, n. 1385, a kind of wooden bowl or dish.&quot; (p. 
184)</p> 
<p> In the absence of documented evidence, educated guesses may be 
constructed. It is possible the name derived from the look of the final 
product. Cob/cobble/cobber convey many meanings in the English language. 
Elizabeth David (<i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>)tells us traditional 
English &quot;cob&quot; bread was small, brown and round. Similar, perhaps to 
cobbletones. Perhaps this is what the the first cobbler resembled?</p> 
<p> While American dictionaries date the first print instance of the term 
&quot;cobbler&quot; in 1859, Nancy Baggett (fellow IACP member and cookbook 
author) recently located this older reference. Proving? Culinary history

<blockquote> <b>[1839]<br>
 &quot;A Peach Pot-Pie.</b> <br>
 A Peach pot pie, 
or cobler, as it is often termed, should be made of clingstone peaches, that 
are very ripe, and then pared and sliced from the stones. Prepare a pot or oven 
with paste, as directed for the apple pot-pie, put in the prepared peaches, 
sprinkle on a large handful of brown sugar, pour in plenty of water to cook the 
peaches without burning them, though there should be but very little liquor or 
syrup when the pie is done. Put a paste over the top, and bake it with moderate 
heat, raising the lid occasionally, to see how it is baking. When the crust is 
brown, and the peaches very soft, invert the crust on a large dish, put the 
peaches evenly on, and grate loaf sugar thickly over it. Eat it warm or cold. 
Although it is not a fashionable pie for company, it is very excellent for 
family use, with cold sweet milk.&quot; ---the Kentucky Housewife, Lettice 
Bryan, facsimile reprint of 1839 edition stereotyped by Shepard &amp; 
Stearns:Cincinnati [Image Graphics:Paducah KY] (p. 268)</blockquote> 
<p> The <i>Dictionary of Americanisms</i> traces the first instance of the 
word cobbler (as it applies to a pie dish) in print to 1859: &quot;Cobbler...a 
sort of pie, baked in a pot lined with dough of great thickness, upon which 
fruit is placed.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;Another kind of cobbler is a western- deep-dish pie with a thick 
crust and a fruit filling. This dish is called bird's nest pudding or crow's

Connecticut, with maple sugar in Massachusetts, and with a sour sauce in

<p></p> <b>Frisbie Pies</b>
<p> According to the records of the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, Wham-O 
introduced its iconic Frisbee flying disc June 17, 1957. The inventor? Walter 
Fred Morrison. The original prototype? Inexpensive metal pie plates. The 
inspiration? Throwing empty pie plates was popular on college student diversion 
during the Great Depression. The name? Frisbie Baking Company, Bridgeport, Ct. 
Who was the first person to throw a pie plate and yell Frisbee? We will never 
know. There are several claimants to this honor. Because Frisbie pies were sold 
in New England, we can assume the fad with this name began there. This does not 
preclude the possibility of other people hurling similar objects in other parts 
of the country (world?) achieving the same purpose. What did a Frisbie Pie Tin 
look like?</p>
<p>  &quot;The Frisbee started as an obscure fad with a beginning as modest as 
a five-cent pie tin. It is widely believed that restless Yale students 
discovered it when they decided to throw pie tins instead of returning them to 
the Frisbie Pie Company in Bridgeport, Conn., for their nickel deposit.&quot;
<br>---&quot;Technology: The Wonders of the Frisbee,&quot; <i>New York Times</i>
, July 5, 1978 (p. D5)</p>
<p> &quot;It's one of Richard Burton's favorite forms of exercise. Carol 
Greiltzer, a New York City councilwoman, does it at every opportunity....What 
they do is fly Frisbees, and they have lots of company. A Frisbee is a plastic 
disk about the size of a pie pan that can soar, dip or bank like a glider when 
thrown properly. First introduced commercially about a dozen years ago by 
Wham-O Manufacturing Co., Frisbees until recently were regarded primarily as 
novelties for children. But of lately the flying of Frisbees has become 
something of a national craze among adults...Soldiers in Vietnam find a Frisbee 
session relaxing after a day in the bush chasing the Vietcong...Guts Frisbee is 
played by two five-man teams standing about 15 yards apart. They hurl the 
plastic disks at each other with awesome force, scoring points when an opponent 
fails to catch a throw one-handed...Legends about the origins of Frisbee are 
many--all probably apocryphal. One has it that way back in 1837 a Yale man 
named Frisbee sailed a church collection plate 200 feet across the campus in 
protest against compulsory chapel. Movie people claim it all started in 
Hollywood in the 1940s when film editors relaxed at lunch by scaling empty film 
tins. But most Frisbee historians agree that the modern era began after World 
War II when the clientele of the now-defunct Frisbie Baking Co. of Bridgeport 
Conn., found that the tin plates holding Mother Frisbie's pies were great for 
soaring. In the late 1950s, Fred Morrison, a pie-tin tosser of notable skill, 
took the idea to Wham-O. The company. The company has since sold several 
million Frisbees, and Mr. Morrison has raked in close to $500,000. in 
royalties.&quot;<br>
 ---&quot;Frisbee Fad Attracts Fans Seeking Sport.&quot; 
W. Stewart Pinkerton,<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, July 2, 1969 (p. 1) </p>
<p> &quot;In the beginning, of course, a Frisbee was a tin plate holding a pie 
that was produced by the thousands in a Bridgeport bakery. The Frisbee Pie 
Company was its name, and somewhere between 1871 (When William R. Frisbie 
started the business) and 1920 (when somebody saw the fun in tossing the empty 
tins), Frisbee started on its way to becoming one of America's rare native 
sports. A mispelling early in the game changed an 'i' to 'e' a man on the West 
Coast (W. Fred Morrison) began manufacturing aerodynamically improved version 
of the disk in 1957. ..A lot has happened to a Frisbee since it held a pie, but 
a lot more has happened to the ability of Frisbee tossers. This becomes very 
evident in an Ultimate Frisbee match, where a team, of seven players tries to 
pass a Frisbee down a 60-yard field without letting it hit the ground or be 
blocked by an opposing team of seven...The ball is dead, as far as Frisbee 
freaks are concerned. A ball holds no mystery, they contend, has a slavish 
attachment to the earth and falls quickly if missed in the initial attempt to 
catch it. But not the Frisbee, which exists just to fly.&quot;<br>
 ---&quot;To 
Frisbee Fans, It's the Ultimate,&quot; Parton Keese,<i>New York Times</i>, 
August 7, 1977 (p. CN1)</p>
<p> &quot;Students at Yale University insist they were the first to pick up a 
Frisbie Pie Company plate and fling it into the air. But similar claims have 
come from Princeton and other Easter colleges and universities. Olin Robinson, 
Middlebury College's president, said both were wrong...'it started here.' To 
honor its certainty, the college unveiled a bronze sculpture a few weeks ago by 
Patrick Farrow, and artist, of a dog catching a flying disc in its mouth. 
Middlebury officials contend that a group of Delta Upsilon fraternity brothers 
tumbled into the game while traveling to a fraternity convention in Nebraska 50 
years ago. Short on cash while on the road, the men took Frisbie fruit pies 
with them to eat, the story goes. They tossed the leftover tin back and forth 
to amuse themselves while waiting for a flat tire to be repaireid. Frist 
Pie-Tin Throwers. It was 1939. 'That fall in Middlebury the air was filled with 
flying pans, every size and shape,' said a story in Middlebury's alumni 
newspaper in the spring of 1976. 'Grade-point averages dropped, football 
atttendance suffered and all stores were out of pie pans.' But even the 
college's official version is disputed by one of the Middlebury students, who 
said he had participated in the fateful event. Elbert Cole, a retired chemist 
living in Palo Alto, Calif., said he and another fraternity brother found a pie 
tin in a Nebraska cornfield and tossed it to each other, yelling 'Frisbie.' 
'People have been throwing pie pans forever, but that's how it got to be called 
Frisbie.' [said] Mr. Cole...Yale suggests that its students were the first to 
throw pie-tins because the Frisbie Pie Company, which was based in Bridgeport, 
Conn., likely sold pies near Yale. David Iovanne, director of the New Haven 
Convention and Visitor Bureau, said it is part of New Haven lor that Yale 
students were the first pie-tin tossers...After World War II, the travels of 
the flying pie tins became easier to document, said Daniel Roddick of the 
Wham-O Manufacturing Company in San Gabriel, Calif., which makes the modern 
plastic Frisbee. In 1948, Walter Fred Morrison, a West Coast inventor and 
building inspector, made plastic versions and marked them as flying saucers, In 
1957, Wham-O discovered the popularity of a game called Frisbie that was played

<p></p> <b>Gateau St. Honore</b> 
<p> Food historians generally agree Gateau Saint Honore belongs to Paris 
(because St. Honore is the patron Saint of patisserie and has a street name in 
Paris after him), but are collectively vague regarding the period. Neither do 
they attibute the creation of this confection to a specific chef or agree on 
the history behind the name.Chiboust (for whom the creme used in this recipe 
was named) was a mid-19th century patissiere. Quite the mystery, yes?</p> 
<p> The ingredients and method of Gateau Saint Honore date the possibility of 
this recipe to the 17th century. Primary evidence confirms master Parisian 
patissieres often employed choux and cream to effect grand dessert 
presentations. Croquant was &quot;invented&quot; at this time. Chantilly creme 
(sometimes referred to as Chiboust) was also &quot;invented&quot; in the 17th 
century. We find nothing close to Saint Honore in La Varenne [1651], but Ude's
<i> French Cook</i> [1828] contains several recipes which might been 
precursors. These are generally composed of choux artfully arranged and filled 
with chantilly cream. Unlike Gateau Saint Honore, however, do not employ 
shortcrust.</p> 
<p> Escoffier [1903] contains a recipe for Creme a Saint-Honore (#4345), but 
not (at least that we can find) Gateau Saint Honore. Neither does it show up in 
Richardin [1913]. The original edition of<i> Larousse Gastronomique</i> [1938] 
includes both description and recipe (en Francais, we can send if you like).</p>
<p> <b>ABOUT GATEAU SAINT HONORE</b></p> 
<p> Gateau Saint Honore, a confection of two kinds of pastry with a cream 
filling. Shortcrust pastry provides a firm base for the soft and flexible choux 
pastry piled round it on top. Glazed profiteroles are stuck to the ring of 
choux. The centre of the ring is filled with a creamy mixture (creme chiboust) 
stiffened with gelatin and lightened with stiffly beaten egg whites. This cake 
is sometimes said to have been named after St. Honore, the patron saint of 
bakers, but others say that it owes its name to the rue Saint-Honore in Paris, 
where it was created (possibly as a development of some existing product) in 
1846 by a patissiere, Chiboust. The learned authors of the Ile-de-France volume 
listed under IPCF (1993) explain why they regard the matter as an unsolved 
mystery.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Saint Honore, a gateau consisting of a layer of shortcrust pastry 
(basic pie dough) or puff pastry on top of which is arranged a crown of choux 
pastry, which is itself garnished with small choux glazed with caramel. The 
inside of the crown is filled with Chiboust cream (also known as Saint Honore 
cream') or Chantilly cream. A Parisian gateau, Saint Honore takes its name from 
the patron saint of bakers and pastrycooks. It is also said that its name comes 
from the fact that the pastrycook Chiboust, who create the cream which is used 
in it, set himself up in the Rue Saint-Honore in Paris.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Grasshopper pie</b>
<p> Food historians and primary evidence place the genesis of this American 
pie in the late 1950s/early 1960s. Chiffon pies were very popular at that time. 
The &quot;grasshopper&quot; name is borrowed from a popular green-colored 
cocktail, also *invented* about this time. There is speculation this recipe was 
invented by food/drink companies to promote their products. It is quite likely, 
although we cannot verify in print. This is what the food historians have to 
say: &quot;I suspect--but cannot verify--that [Grasshopper Pie] recipes descend 
from one that appeared in High Spirited Desserts, a recipe flier publsihed 
jointly by Knox Unflavored Gelatine and Heublein Cordials. It begins 
&quot;Dinner guests sometimes click their heels with glee over a superb 
dessert.&quot; Then it goes on to urge the reader to be &quot;devil-may-care. 
Knox Unflavored Gelatine provides a variety of handsome and delectable dishes. 
Heublein Cordials provide the spirits that give each sweet masterpiece 
inimitable flavor. Serve with pride. Await applause modestly.&quot; 
Unfortunately, there's no date on the leaflet. Given its yellowing state, 
however, its purple prose, and whimsical Jester illustrations, I suspect that 
it belongs to the late 50s or, possible, the early 60s.&quot;<br>

after-dinner drink, which is made by shaking 1/2 ounce cream, 1/2 ounce white

<p> &quot;Q. Do you know the origin of the name chiffon as related to cooking 
and the origin of a chiffon pie known as a grasshopper? A. The word chiffon 
obviously applies to foods that have a delicate or light and fluffy 
consistency. I seriously doubt that any book could date the exact origin of the 
word. A grasshopper pie is made with green creme de menthe, white creme de 
cacao and cream. The filling comes out a delicate green color. The word derives 
from the cocktail that bears the name grasshopper, It is made with those 
ingredients, which are shaken with ice and strained.&quot;<br>

published in 1904. It is for the &quot;real&quot; thing:&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Big grasshoppers, such as grow fat and buzz loudly in the Orient, 
are looked upon as table delicacies in the Philippines. There are several 
methods used by the natives for catching grasshoppers. The most effective is 
the net...The hopper is first so thoroughly dried out in the head of the sun or 
in the bake oven that there is nothing left that is really objectionable, and a 
nice crispy article of food results. This states sweet of itself, and something 
like ginger biscuits. The natives usually sweetend the grasshopeer more by 
using a sprinkling of brown sugar. Then the confectioners make up grasshoppers 
with sugar, chocolate trimmings, and colored candies in such a way a very nice 
tasting piece of confectionery is obtained. The housewife of the Philippines 
takes considerable delight in placing before you a nice grasshopper pie or 
cake. The grashopper pie is the most wonderful dish, as the big hoppers are 
prepared in such a way that they do not lose their form.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Impossible pie</b>
<p> Is it possible to mix up several ingredients, pour it into a baking 
recepticle and have the layers naturally settle into a pie formation (crust on 
the bottom; filling on the top). Yes, according to the makers of Impossible 
pie. This 20th century novelty recipe took some parts of our country by storm.
</p>
<p> The origins of Impossible Pie (aka mystery pie, coconut amazing pie) are 
sketchy at best. A survey of newspaper/magazine articles suggests this recipe 
originated in the south (where coconut custard pies are popular). It was 
*discovered* by General Mills (Bisquick) and General Foods, who capitalized on 
the opportunity to promote their products. Corporate recipes surfaced in the 
mid-1970s. There are conflicting reports about the dates of introduction. The 
earliest recipe we have on file was published in 1968. None of the ingredients 
are name-brand.</p>
<p> This article sums up the situation best:<br>
 &quot;Amazing. Mysterious. 
It could be none other than Impossible Pie, one of the most successful 
corporate recipe projects in the U.S. food-marketing history. Versions of 
Impossible Pie were also named Mystery Pie or Amazing Coconut Pie. By any name, 
though, Americans took to the easy recipe that is adaptable for making both 
sweet dessert pies and savory meat, vegetable and cheese pies. Back when quiche 
was trendy, the Impossible Pie formula called for ingredients similar to those 
for quiche yet eliminated the need to make a separate pastry crust...Not one 
but two huge food corporations benefited by popularizing the simple recipe 
formula for the Impossible Pie mixtures: the two big &quot;Generals.&quot; One 
was the Minneapolis-based General Mills, home of mythical Betty Crocker and 
maker of Bisquick all-purpose baking mix. The other was General Foods of White 
Plains, N.Y., marketer of Angel Flake processed coconut...The real mystery: 
Where did this recipe originate? We know the two &quot;Generals&quot; took a 
basic formula and then developed variations to showcase their respective 
products. Lisa Van Riper, spokeswoman for Kraft General Foods, said the 
company's well-advertised recipe for Amazing Coconut Pie, &quot;was developed 
as a result of a creative adaptation of the Bisquick Impossible Pies. We took a 
Bisquick Impossible Pie and did a creative twist by adding coconut, raisins and 
some other things. That was developed in June 1976 by our test-kitchen's task 
force from a recipe submitted by various sources. Essentially that source was 
the Bisquick Impossible Pie. The Amazing Coconut Pie recipe also forms its own 
crust--with the baking mix sinking to the bottom of a custard mixture--and has 
been used ever since 1976, according to Van Riper. General Mills' Marcia 
Copeland, director of Betty Crocker foods and publications, recalls that 
&quot;we first saw the recipe for (crustless) coconut custard pies in Southern 
community cookbooks.&quot; Sot it was a grass-roots recipe first, origin 
unknown. Some very old community cookbooks contain pie recipes that make their 
own crusts just from flour; others call for homemade biscuit mix. Copeland said 
that the Impossible Pie phenomenon lasted from the late 1970s through the 
80s... General Mills' home economists developed variations for Impossible 
Chicken n' Broccoli Pie, for Enchilada, Lasagna, Taco, Pizza and Beef Mushroom 
Impossible Pies, even an Impossible Turkey n' Stuffing Pie...&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Key lime pie</b> 
<p> Certainly, such a popular pie would have much available in the way of 
history. Not! Food historians confirm the popularity of limes (a gift from 16th 
century Spanish explorers), presence of pies (an &quot;Old World&quot; recipe), 
and eager acceptance of condensed milk (mid-19th century). Presumably, the 
&quot;inspiration&quot; for Key Lime pie isLemon meringue. </p> 
<p> &quot;According to John Egerton (Southern Food, 1987), Key Lime Pie was 
known in the Florida Keys &quot;as far back as the 1890s.&quot; It don't doubt 
it a bit because in those pre-refrigerator days, fresh milk was a poor keeper. 
What local cooks had learned to rely on was the sweetened condensed milk Gail 
Borden had begun canning shortly before the Civil War.&quot;<br>

 [NOTE: This book

<p> &quot;Key lime pies were first made in the Keys in the 1850s. Jean A. 
Voltz, in<i>The Flavor of the South</i> (1977), explains that the recipe 
developed with the advent of sweetened condensed milk in 1856. Since there were 
few cows on the Keys, the new canned milk was welcomed by the residents and 
introduced into a pie made with lime juice. The original pies were made with a 
pastry crust, but a crust made from graham crackers later became popular and 
today is a matter of preference, as is the choice between whipped cream and 
meringue toppings. There are three recipes for Key lime pie in<i>The Key West 
Cook Book</i> (1949), only one of which refers to a graham-cracker crust, and 
two of which do not require the pie to be baked. One has no topping, one 
whipped cream, and one meringue.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Recipe for The Breakers Key Lime Pie?</b><br>
 &quot;Q. I would like to 
make a good key lime pie. I think the version at The Breakers in Palm Beach is 
outstanding. Could you get the recipe?-- M. Herzog, Highland Beach<br>
 A. 
Executive chef Michael Norton provided the recipe, which uses typical key lime 
pie ingredients -- but with several significant differences in their use. The 
recipe calls for about twice as much condensed milk as the standard recipe, and 
then the pie is baked, rather than simply refrigerated. The result is a very 
creamy filling, a bit stiffer and higher than the usual, that lacks the raw egg 
flavor one sometimes encounters in a key lime pie. The use of cake flour in the 
pastry makes the crust very tender and delicate; use some extra care in the 
rolling process.</p> 
<p> <b>THE BREAKERS' KEY LIME PIE </b><br>
<b>Crust:</b><br>
 5 tablespoons 
shortening<br>
 7 tablespoons cake flour<br>
 2 tablespoons sugar<br>
 1 egg<br>
 3 tablespoons milk<br>
<b>Filling:</b><br>
 3 egg yolks<br>
 5 ounces (10 
tablespoons) lime juice<br>
 2 14-ounce cans, minus 4 tablespoons, sweetened 
condensed milk<br>
<b>Garnish:</b><br>
 Lightly sweetened whipped cream<br>
 
Lime slices<br>
 To make the crust: Cut the shortening into the flour. Sprinkle 
on the sugar, then blend in the egg and milk. Roll on a lightly floured surface 
into a circle to fit a deep, 10-inch pie plate. Place in plate, prick bottom 
and sides, weight with beans or rice and bake about 6 minutes at 375 degrees, 
or until pastry is a light brown. Cool before filling. To make the filling: 
Beat the egg yolks, lime juice and condensed milk until smooth and creamy. Pour 
into pre-baked pie shell and bake 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Watch pastry crust 
during this time; if the rim starts to get too brown, shield with foil. Cool 
pie and then top with whipped cream. Garnish with slices of fresh lime. Makes 8 
to 10 servings. Several readers wrote with suggestions for those who suffer 
from the hard brown sugar blues. &quot;I take it out of the cardboard box as 
soon as I bring it home from the store,&quot; said Sally Lewis of Miami. 
&quot;I then repack it in an airtight Tupperware container. In 11 years of 
using this method I've never had a case of hard brown sugar, even when I've 
kept the same sugar for a year.&quot; Dorothy Ligush of Pompano Beach advocates 
using the same method. &quot;It will save a lot of tempers.&quot; She says that 
if the sugar does pack some from nonuse, &quot;I just run a fork or knife 
through it to fluff it.&quot; J. Pierce says she uses a wide-mouth glass jar to 
store her brown and confectioners' sugars and never is faced with hardness or 
too much moisture.&quot;<br>

<p>  About condensed milk  About Key (Mexican) limes </p> 
<p> Frozen lime pie is an interation of Key lime pie. The oldest mention we 
find in print for the frozen pie implies the recipe existed at least as early 
as the 1970s. Of course, most recipes exist long before they appear in print.

<p> &quot;Mabel Brotzman asked for help in finding a lost recipe for a Key 
Lime Pie that can be frozen for serving later. We received dozens of replies 
from readers. Marcia H. Kenward said she'd clipped the recipe from The Miami 
Herald &quot;at least 30 years ago.&quot; That recipe calls for stirring in 1 
to 2 drops of green food coloring if desired. As Dot Schuck of Key Largo puts 
it: &quot;Most folks from up North think Key lime should be green.&quot; The 
vintage recipe calls for separated eggs in the filling, which makes it more 
involved but airier in texture. The more popular recipe, at least as far as our 
mail indicates, is made with frozen whipped topping. Barbara Bliss sent her 
boyfriend Dave's incredibly easy recipe, which is similar to many we received. 
Tips: If you are making your own graham cracker crust, try brushing egg white 
on the top just before baking to keep the crust crisp. Remove the pie from the 
freezer no more than 5 minutes before serving. Paula Prouty of Key West and 
Scarborough, Maine, where she is a newspaper food editor, simply makes a 
regular Key lime pie, with a meringue top, and then freezes it.</p>

<p> Where is lemon meringue pie considered a *traditional* dessert? Many 
places are known for this particular pie. Many of them are in the South. Lemons 
are a favorite component of southern cooking. Think lemon chess pie and 
lemonade.</p> 
<p> &quot;Lemon meringue pie has been around a long time in the South and most 
likely grew out of the vast repertoire of puddings, whose popularity pies 
eclipsed in the late nineteenth century. It is remarkably similar ot the Queen 
of Puddings.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;A pie can always be turned out for dessert as long as there are 
lemons in the house, and American cooks have devised many recipes. President 
Calvin Coolidge is said to have favored a simple lemon custard pie. The even 
more common lemon meringue, ever present in public eating places, is one more 
dish served at Boston's Parker House that has become a classic in the American 
repertoire. And a special version gained fame swiftly when it went on the menu 
of the Lion House Social Center in Salt Lake. The following version is based on 
a method worked out in the 1960s by the late Michael Field in collaboration 
with Dr. Paul Buck, a food scientist at Cornell University. The determined Mr. 
Field devoted days to making lemon meringue pie after another until he 
eliminated the &quot;weeping&quot; common to meringues that sit around on 
counter; his trick was to use a little calcium phosphate powder, a food-grade 
phosphate product available in drugstores and suggested by Dr. Buck.&quot;<br>

<p>  ABOUT MERINGUE<br>
</p> 
<p> Food historians tell us the precursor for meringue was an Elizabethan-era 
dish called&quot;Snow&quot;. (aka snow eggs). What exactly is meringue and who 
is credited for the discovery?</p> 
<p> &quot;Meringue...an airy, crisp confection of beaten egg white and sugar. 
The word probably entered French from German, as did many other French words 
ending in -ingue. It first appeared in print in Massailot [1691], although 
earlier recipes for the same thing but without the name had been published. The 
name travelled to England almost at once and first appeared in print there in 
1706....It seems to have been only in the 16th century that European cooks 
discovered that beating egg whites, e.g. with a whisk of birch twigs (in the 
absense of any better implement), produced an attractive foam. At first the 
technique was used to make a simple, uncooked dish called snow, made from egg 
white and cream. However, cooking such a foam would not have resulted in 
meringue, for any fat in the mixture, as represented by the cream, prevents the 
egg whites from taking on the proper texture...When true meringue made its 
appearance in the 17th century, it still lacked its name and was often called 
&quot;sugar puff.&quot;&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan 
Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 197)</p> 
<p> &quot;Meringue. The name for this confection of sugar and beaten egg white 
is a direct borrowing from French &quot;meringue.&quot; but beyond that its 
origins are obscure. Legend has it variously that it was named after the town 
of Meringen in central Switzerland of after the Saxon town of Mehringyghen, 
seat of the operations of the Swiss pastrycook Gasparini who supposedly 
invented it there in 1720. However, the fact that the word had even entered the 
English language before this (it is first mentioned in Edward Phillip's 
dictionary<i>The New World of English Words</i>, in John Kersey's 1706 edition) 
casts considerable doubt on the story. In fact, mixtures of beaten egg white 
and sugar cooked in a slow oven had been popular since the early seventeenth 
century (they were called &quot;Italian biscuit&quot;), and it was the great 
increase in the proportion of egg white which marked the inception of the 
superlight meringue towards the end of the century.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A to Z 
of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 211)
<br> [The 2008 online <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> confirms the earliest 
Englis print reference for meringue dates to 1706:<br>
 1. a. A light mixture 
of stiffly beaten egg whites and sugar, baked until crisp; a shell or other 
item of confectionery made of this mixture, typically decorated or filled with 
whipped cream. In some recipes, esp. when meringue is used as a topping, 
cooking of the mixture is stopped before it is completely crisp: cf. SNOW n.1 
5a. 1706 Phillips's New World of Words (ed. 6), Meringues (Fr. in Cookery), a 
sort of Confection made of the Whites of Eggs whipt; fine Sugar, and grated 
Lemmon-peel, of the bigness of a Wal-nut; being proper for the garnishing of 
several Dishes.</p> 
<p> &quot;Whites of eggs produced the Elizabethan dishful of snow, a 
spectacular centrepiece for the banquet course following a festal meal...The 
beating of egg whites was not altogether easy before the fork came into common 
use late in the seventeenth century...A 1655 recipe for cream with snow 
suggested a cleft stick, or a bundle of reeds tied together and roll between 
your hands standing upright in your cream....at the turn of the [17th] century 
a still lighter creation was introduced from France, in which the proportion of 
frothed egg white to sugar was greatly increased. The new arrival was quickly 
added to the sweetmeats of Britain, among which it is still to be found. Its 
French name remains unaltered. It was the meringue.&quot;<br>

Gasparini, a Swiss pastrycook who practiced his art in a small the small German

<p> <b>[1828]<br>
 &quot;Dry Meringues.</b><br>
 It is to be observed, that 
meringues, to be well made, require the eggs to be fresh, and that you are not 
to break them till the very moment you are going to use them. Have some pounded 
sugar that is quite dry, break the white of the eggs into a clean and very deep 
pan, break them without loss of time, tell they are very firm, then take as 
many spoonsful of sugar as you have whites, and beat them lightly with the eggs 
till the whole is well mixed. Observe, that you are to be very expedtious in 
making the meringues, to prevent the sugar from melting in the eggs. Have some 
boards thick enough to prevent the bottom of the meringues from getting baked 
in the oven. Cut slips of paper two inches broad, on which place the meringues 
with a spoon; give them the shape of an egg cut in half, and let them all be of 
an equal size: sift some sugar over them, and blow off the sugar that may have 
fallen on the paper; next lay your slips of paper on a board, and bake them in 
an oven moderately hot. As soon as they begin to colour remove them from the 
oven: take each slip of paper by the two ends, and turn it gently on a table; 
take off a little of the middle with a small spoon. Spread some clean paper on 
the board, turn the meringues upside down on that paper, and put them into the 
oven, that the crumb or soft part may be baked and acquire substance. When you 
have done this, keep them in a dry place till wanted. Then you send them up to 
table, fill them with creme a la Chantilli, or with something acid. Remember, 
however, that you are not to use articles that are very sweet, the meringues 
being sweet in themselves. Mind that the spoon is to be filled with sugar to 
the brim, for the sweeter the meringues are, the better and crisper they are; 
but if, on the contrary, you do not sugar enough, the meringues are tough. The 
pink is sometimes made by adding a little carmine diluted in some of the 
apareil, but the white ones are preferable; if a clean sheet of paper is put 
into a small stock-pot, and the meringues also put therein, and well covered, 
they will keep for one or two months as good and crisp as the first day: on 
which account, if you have a vacancy for one dish, which is wanted in haste, it 
will be found very advantageous to have them made beforehand.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>ABOUT LEMON COOKERY </b><br>
 Lemons (and other citrus fruits) were 
known to ancient cooks. According to the food historians, their acid flavor was 
appreciated and incorporated into many dishes. These fruits were expensive and 
usually preserved (dried) then used in cakes reserved for special occasions. 
Fruitcake, great bride's cake, Gallette du Roi are examples. The lemon cakes we 
know today trace their roots to Medieval European cooks. These cooks often used 
&quot;perfumed waters&quot; (such as rosewater) to flavor their foods and for 
medicial purposes. Recipes for these &quot;perfumes&quot; were later employed 
to make fruit flavorings. Orange water (aka orangeflower water) was popular in 
France during the seventeenth century. Culinary evidence confirms cakes, 
cookies, puddings, cheesecakes, tarts, jellies, and other sweet desserts often 
incorporated orange flavoring. Lemon recipes followed, often as a simple 
ingredent substitition for oranges. 18th century English cookbooks list lemon 
cakes as a recipe variation for Orange Cakes (Mrs. Raffald,<i>The Experienced 
English Housekeeper</i> [1769]. By the 19th century, lemon cakes were standard 
fare in American cookbooks. Popular American recipes featuring lemons include:
Lemon Meringue Pie, Lemon Bars &amp; Lemonade. </p> 
<p> <b>Where did lemons originate?</b><br>
 &quot;Lemon The fruit of Citrus 
medica, a tree whose original home may have been in the north of India. It only 
reached the Mediterranean towards the end of the 1st century AD, whemn the 
Romans discovered a direct sea route from the sourthern end of the Red Sea to 
India. Tolkowsky...adduces complex arguments in favour of this view (as against 
the earlier view that the lemon did not arrive until the 10th century), and 
refers to frescos found at Pompeii (and therefore prior to AD 70) which show 
what he regards as indisputably lemons; also a mosaic pavement probably from 
Tusculum...of about 100 AD in which a lemon is shown with an orange and a 
citron. Thus the fruit which can reasonably be regarded as the most important 
for European cookery was a comparatively late arrival. Nor was its use in 
cookery, as an acid element, appreciated at once. Nor, indeed, was there a 
Latin word for lemon. It seems likely that in classical Rome the fruit was 
treated as a curiosity and a decoration, and that lemon trees were not grown in 
Italy until later. The Arabs seem to have been largely responsible for the 
spread of lemon cultivation in the Mediterranean region...Arab traders also 
spread the lemon eastward to China...During the Middle Ages lemons were rare 
and expensive in N. Europe, and available only to the rich...Lemons reached the 
New World...in 1493, when Columbus, on his second voyage, established a 
settlement on Haiti.&quot;<br>

Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 449)<br>
 [NOTE: this book 
has much more information on the history of lemons than can be paraphrased 
here. Ask your librarian to help you find a copy of this book.]</p> 
<p> &quot;The lemon...owes its name entirely to the botanists, for it was 
unkown to classical writers. However, it was widely used from the Middle Ages 
onwards. It was regarded as an essential in the seventeenth 
century...Originally from the foothills of the Kashmir, the lemon did not reach 
China...until around 1900BC. In China, it was given the name limung, which it 
retained almost unchanged when it moved on to Persia and Media. From the tenth 
century AD onwards the Arabs, who called it li mum...took it all around the 
Mediterranean basin, eastwards to Greece by way of Constantinople, westwards to 
Spain by way of Maghreb and Fezzan. The Spanish and Russians retained the name 
limon, which becomes lemon in English...&quot;<br>

Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat [Barnes &amp; Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 662)</p>
<p> &quot;Lemons were one of the most sought after fruits in early modern 
Europe. Being associated with sunny southern Europe they were considered 
healthy, much the same way we think of Mediterranean foods today. Their juice 
was used as a condiment, especially on fish because its acidity was thought to 
cut through the &quot;gluey humors&quot; abounding in seafood, making them more 
digestible. Northern Europeans generally had to import lemons, but eventually a 
way to grow them indoors was devised. Lemon peel, grated or candied lemon was 
also a typical garnish.&quot;<br>

citrus juices were among many articles of diet used in attempts to find a cure 
for scurvy...Lemon juice was favored by the early Spanish explorers as an 
antiscorbutic, and Dutch and English voyagers also included it in their ships' 
stores, although it was more likely to find a place among the medicines than as 
a regular article of diet....Captain Cook...was supplied with lemon juice as a

cultivated among the Arabs who carried its culture into Europe and Africa. It 
is now naturalized in the West Indies and other parts of tropical America...The 
pulp of the fruit abounds in citric acid. There is, however, a variety 
cultivated in the south of Europe, the juice of which is very sweet. The acid 
juice of the common kind is laregley employed in preparing the beverage known 
as lemonade...Lemons vary very much in size, and the ordinary boxes contain 
from two hundred and forty to four hundred and twenty lemons each; the brands L 
and LL being used to designate sizes, single L;'s being the largest. They are 
wrapped separately in order to prevent decay by crushing together. Thin-skinned 
lemons are the juiciest. There are over thirty varieties of lemons in 
cultivation, but they are generally classified according to the place of growth 
or shipping. The principal importations into this country are from Sicily 
(Messina lemons) and from Valencia. The lemon can be successfully grown in 
Florida and California--products which are receiving great attention. The oil 
of lemon is largley used in cooking and confectionery; the extract of lemon, 
sold for domestic use, being simply a dilute solution of the oil in alcohol. 
The pure juice of the lemon is extremely efficacious in attacks of acute 
rheumatism.&quot;<br>

 The cargo of 2,400 boxes of oranges and 5,500 boxes of 
lemons that the steamer Iniziativa brought from Messina was sold yesterday by 
Brown &amp; Seccomb of 25 State Street. Prices of lemons had been steadily 
advancing for over a week, until an advance of $1 per box was reached, and a 
story was started that a storm in the Mediterranean had shaken down a very 
large number of lemons from the trees at Messina, and that consequently there 
was a scarcity of that fruit, as the shaken lemons had rotted on the ground. 
Mr. Brown, however, denied that there had been any storm about Messina, and 
said that the advance in price was owing to the light receipts and the warm 
weather. There were plenty of lemons in Messina, and as soon as prices advanced 
here the shippers there would sent on all that were needed. After the first 
sale yesterday prices declined 50 cents per box.&quot;<br>

 &quot;There has been a considerable advance in the 
price of lemons, owing partly to the increased demand for them, caused by the 
hot weather and partly to a shortage in the Sicilian crop. A box of lemons 
which would sell in ordinary seasons for $2.50, is now worth between $5 and $6. 
The dealers in this crop feel sure that nothing but prolonged cool weather can 
diminish the present price of the fruit.&quot;<br>

 Our survey of historic newspapers confirms lemons were 
sold by the dozen in 1928. Prices ranged from 21 to 41 cents a dozen, 39 cents 
most prevalent. The majority of the ads were for Sunkist brand lemons. We 
cannot confirm packaging (sold in prepacked bags?). Of course, it is possible 
the were sold as individual units. Generally, individual items are priced 
higher than larger quantities. Take the price of a dozen, divide by 12, and add 
extra (round up for profit).</p>

 &quot;In this era of beautiful women, lemons are 
becoming very popular as cosmetics for the hands, face and hair. There seems to 
be some kind of belief that a highly decorated jar with a pretty ribbon helps 
the beautifier, but lemons are probably the most inexpensive as well as one of 
the most effective cosmetics obtainable. Every beauty shop uses lemons in some 
of its preparations, and many housewives make it a rule to use the juice of a 
lemon on their hands after washing the dishes or on their hair after a shampoo. 
The mild citric acid removes the soap curd that attaches itself to the hair 
after washing...[lemons] make an excellent dentifrice to use on sore and 
bleeding gums. Used night and morning it will make a remarkable change in 
tightening up loose gums and improving the circulation and cleanliness of the 
mouth. There are a number of household uses of lemon juice for removing rust, 
ink or fruit stains, polishing aluminum ware and piano keys. The lemon is 
chiefly valuable for its antiscorbutic vitamins. Bottled lemon juice, 
sterilized at low temperature may be kept for a long time and should be carried 
by those who are compelled to make long trips into regions that will be 
deficient in fresh fruit and vegetables. Lemons may be preserved from drying 
out by immersing in fresh cold water.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>MEYER LEMONS</b><br>
 Sweet, tangy, delicious and amazing. If you have 
the opportunity to taste one of these special lemons, go for it! Originating in 
China, introduced to the USA in 1908, popular in the 1930s. Who wasFrank Meyer? 
</p> 
<p> &quot;The Meyer Lemon is not a hybrid but is a distinct citrus species 
found only a few years ago in a remote region of China by one of the famous 
plant explorers of the United States Department of Agriculture, Mr. Fred Meyer. 
It is sometimes called the Chinese Dwarf Lemon because it does not grow as 
large as the ordinary Lemon tree. If it bore no fruit at all, the Meyer would 
still be worth planting as an ornamental in our gardens because it makes a 
spendid, bush, dense-foliaged shrub, growing to about eight feet and with 
flowers on it during almost the entire year....The fruit...is almost double the 
size of the usual Lemon, roundish-oval in shape, and of a rich orange-yellow 
color; about halfway between the Orange and the ordinary Lemon in appearance. 
It will serve any purpose to which a Lemon can be put and is available almost 
from the time the plant is put out, because the plants bear immediately and are 
almost never without fruit form that time on.&quot;<br>

Notes,&quot; John A. Armstrong,<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, February 12, 1933 (p. 
H12)</p> 
<p> &quot;...for home places where room is not plentiful, the new Chinese 
dwarf lemon, the Meyer, is possibly the finest lemon that can be lanted. The 
late Frank Meyer, plant explorer of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, did California a great service when he found this lemon in the 
door-yard plantings of China. It is much hardier and easier to grow than the 
commercial lemons of California. It will thrive anywhere in Southern 
California, not only producing big juicy orange-colored fruits, which can be 
used for all the purposes for which lemons are needed, but making a handsome 
ornamental plant. It reaches a height of eight feet and has luxuriant foliage, 
with big fragrant blooms which are even more highly perfumed than those of the 
orange.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;One of the best varities for back-yard production is the Meyer 
lemon, which has proven its value since its introduction in 1908. Discovered in 
dwarf form growing in the gardens of China by Frank Meyer, this particualr 
variety will stand slightly colder temperatrues than other types, although all 
lemons are susceptible to frost damage. Fruit is of medium size, thin-skinned 
and smooth. Size of the tree may be an advantage in most gardens since it will 
only reach 8 ft. in height in 20 years, while producting an abundance of 
fragrant flowers and yellow-orange fruit. Lemons ripen and begin to fall during 
the month of May.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Palmiers</b> 
<p> The practice of fashioning sweet desserts from many-layered pastry is an 
ancient tradition originating in the Middle East. Baked or fried, thick or 
thin, large or small, they are often served at festive occasions. According to 
the food historians, filo/phyllo was of Turkish origin. One of the most popular 
foods made with this kind of dough isbaklava. Milles-feuilles (literally, 
thousand leaves) was a 19th century French invention based on the same 
principle and adapted to the tastes of the day. Today there are several 
variations on this culinary theme. French Palmiers, AfghanElephant Ears Spanish 
sopaipillas, &amp; Native American fry bread descend from these traditions. </p>
<p> Our food reference books state palmiers (also known as palm leaves) were 
invented around the turn of the 20th century. The name suggests they were first 
made in France, but we find no evidence confirming this. In fact, we find a 
recipe for palm leaves (Palmenblatter) in<i>Viennese Cooking</i>, O. And A. 
Hess [Crown:New York] 1960 (p. 213), which suggests this pastry might have 
commanded a broader swath of geography. We also find no attribute to the first 
person/restaurant credited for cooking/serving this cookie. In the world of 
food history, this is not uncommon.</p> 
<p> &quot;Palmier. A small pastry made of a sugared and double-rolled sheet of 
puff pastry cut into slices, the distinctive shape of which resembles the 
foliage of a palm tree. First made at the beginning of the 20th century, 
palmiers are served with tea or as an accompaniment to ices and desserts.&quot;
<br> ---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson 
Potter] 2001 p. 832)</p> 
<p> &quot;Palmiers are small sweet biscuits made from puff pastry and shaped 
somewhat like butterflies. To their anonymous early twentieth-century inventor 
their shape evidently suggested more the topknot of leaves on a palm, for 
French palmier means literally 'palm tree'.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A-Z of Food and 
Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 237) </p> 
<p> &quot;Palmier. Also called palm leaves, palmiers are small pastries made 
from sugar-encrusted puff pastry. The sides of a rectangle of puff pastry are 
folded into the center, then folded over to make four layers, and cut across 
the width into thin strips. These are laid on their sides on a baking sheet and 
they fan out as they bake to resemble the leaves of palm trees. Palmiers are 
baked until they are crisp and the sugar caramelizes to a rich golden brown. 
They are served with tea or coffee or as an accompaniment to ice cream and 
other desserts. France.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>The International Dictionary of 
Desserts, Pastries and Confections</i>, Carole Bloom [Hearst Books:New York ] 
1995 (p. 210)</p> 
<p> &quot;Sometimes, you just have to hand it to French culinary genius. Take 
the palmier (palm-YAY). It's a cookie, nothing more than flour, water, salt, a 
light sprinkling of sugar and immoderate amounts of butter. Yet as the palmiers 
bake, the moisture in the butter-riddled layers evaporates, causing the dough 
to puff into hundreds of paper-thin flakes. Meanwhile, the sugar caramelizes 
ever so slightly, casting a glassy sheen. The result? A pastry whose crisp, 
caramelized exterior gives way at the slightest pressure to countless crisp 
layers. Ironically, such a delicacy originated as a means for resourceful 
pastry chefs to salvage leftover puff pastry dough. (When you consider the 
labor-intensive nature of puff pastry, you understand why one would want to use 
every last piece.) Though simple, the technique used to make palmiers can be 
fraught with peril. When rolled too tightly, sliced a smidgen too thick or 
underbaked by even a minute, the interior remains soggy and leaden. When rolled 
too loosely or baked at excessive temperatures, the pastry becomes brittle and 
shatters upon touch. And when caked with sugar, the delicate balance is lost 
and the pastry becomes one-dimensional. Athough ubiquitous throughout France, 
the proper palmier is hard to find here. At some American bakeries the 
Frisbee-size confection is as sweet as saccharin and dubbed the &quot;Elephant 
Ear.&quot; At Latin American markets, they may be labeled orejas 
(&quot;ears&quot; in Spanish) though the only ones I have come across are 
packaged in plastic, which suffocates the crisp pastry. And at a German bakery, 
I once requested a palmier and received nothing more than a polite, though 
perplexed, stare. It seems I should have requested the rather inelegantly named 
&quot;Pig's Ear.&quot; Some franchise French bakeries, such as La Madeleine, 
have &quot;palmiers&quot; that are far inferior to the &quot;elephant 
ears&quot; offered by Fresh Fields/Whole Foods Market. Though mass production 
is no friend to the palmier because the slicing and sprinkling go largely 
unpoliced, a notable exception is the downtown Washington location of Fresh 
Fields/Whole Foods Market, whose elephant ears put most palmiers to shame. 
(Though all of the stores use the same frozen puff pastry dough shipped from a 
French bakery in Manhattan, the P Street store's bakery consistently turns out 
a crisp, buttery, flaky palmier, albeit the size of a dinner plate.) Buonaparte 
Breads at Historic Savage Mill in Savage and in Baltimore produces a fine 
palmier, but they no longer ship them to their retail customers in the District 
since they are too fragile. Whether sent out with after-dinner espresso at 
Michel Richard's Citronelle in Georgetown or nibbled as an elegant something to 
satisfy a sweet tooth on a leisurely afternoon, the palmier can be an amazing 
thing. When you can find them. They are usually priced by the pound and vary 
greatly in size. SEN5ES For the palmier lover, the pastry case at Georgetown's 
sedate Sen5es Bakery and Restaurant is a sight to behold. Row after flawless 
row of compact, perfectly wound palmiers are nestled against one another. While 
they last. &quot;Believe me,&quot; says pastry chef, Bruno Feldeisen. &quot;If 
I don't have them, I hear about it!&quot; Feldeisen says he doesn't make a 
profit on the palmiers. But it's one of the little things that chefs do for 
their clientele. Most days, that is. &quot;It needs to be made with love, and 
sometimes we don't have the love,&quot; explains Feldeisen...PATISSERIE POUPON 
Ruth Poupon's rendition of a palmier defines daintiness. Slightly larger than a 
silver dollar (or rather, a French franc) and so thin as to be almost 
diaphanous, it seems as though it might shatter if breathed upon. But it is 
surprising sturdy. (Those at the bottom of the bag do tend to break though.) 
The appropriately faint sweetness is underscored by a crisp, barely colored 
pastry that, lacking much caramelization, in truth seems almost more butter 
cookie than palmier...AMERNICK At first glance, Amernick bakery in Cleveland 
Park may seem an unlikely source for a palmier. Yet Ann Amernick, who has held 
pastry chef positions with Michel Richard and White House pastry chef Roland 
Mesnier, chose to include, amid her eclectic assortment of pastries, a 
rendition laced not with sugar but a sharp, salty blend of Parmigiano-Reggiano 
and aged Dutch Gouda cheeses. Amernick's savory rendition is best appreciated 
when taken home and warmed in the oven. Why a savory palmier? It's a carry-over 
from the days when Amernick's bakery was in Wheaton, on the site of a former 
Dutch bakery. The palmiers were a favorite of customers, says Amernick. 
&quot;And I liked them.&quot; An equally laudatory stick version is also 
available...&quot;<br>

 Break the egg into a bowl, beat it, and add enough milk to make

to the egg and milk mixture, and mix well to form a firm dough. Knead on a 
lightly floured board for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide the 
dough into eight equal balls, cover with a moistened cloth and set to one side 
in a cool place for about half an hour. On a lightly floured board, roll out 
each of the eight balls until paper thin; they should be approximately 7&quot; 
(18 cm) in diameter. Shape the 'ears' by pleating one side of each round piece 
of dough. Nip together with wet fingers, to prevent the pleats from opening 
during drying. In a frying-pan of similar diameter, heat enough oil to 
shallow-fry the pastries. When the oil is very hot, put in the 'ears' one at a 
time and fry until golden brown and bubbly, then turn and fry the other side 
until golden brown. As you remove the pastries from the pan, shake off the 
excess oil gently, then sprinkle them on both sides with a mixture of sifted 
icing sugar and ground pistachio. &quot;There are many variations of

reading the letters that have poured in about elephant ears and funnel cake. It 
all began when we pubished a letter from Ann Mehr of Schaumberg, who wanted a 
recipe for the elephant ears sold at Wisconsin county fairs. She described them 
as batter fried in deep fat and sprinkled with cinnamon. We replied that they 
sounded like the fried dough we get at our country fairs here in the East. We 
then got a letter from Linda Mao or Rocky Mount, N. C., who said, no, no, a 
thousand times no! What Ann is looking for is funnel cake, and she kindly sent 
us a recipe, which we published. Letters poured in from Nebraska to New 
Hampshire, telling us that funnel cake and elephant ears are totally different, 
and depending on who was writing, that elephant ears aren't deep-fat fried 
anyway; they are BAKED. From Faye Bean of Friend, Neb.: &quot;Here's the 
elephant ears recipe (my father used to call them 'shoe soles'). You can use 
any dinner-roll or bread recipe if you want to make them from scratch our you 
can use frozen dinner rolls instead of frozen bread.&quot;</p>

 Let dough rise 
untildoubled in size. Combine sugars and cinamon. Roll out dough on a floured 
surface to a 16-by-12-inch rectangle. Brush with half the butter and sprinkle 
with 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture. Fold in half and roll out again into a 
16-by-12-inch rectangle. Brush with remaining butter and sprinkle with 2 
tablespoons of sugar mixture. Roll up, starting with the 16-inch side. Cut into 
16 pieces. Sprinkle rolling surface with sugar mixture. Roll out each piece 
into 1/8 to 1/4 inch, turning to coat both sides with sugar. Place on

pecans into her syrup pie or brown sugar pie. Alas, there are not records to 
prove it. In fact, I could if no cookbooks printing pecan pie recipes before 
the early twentieth century. And only in th 1940s did &quot;Fannie&quot; and 
&quot;Joy&quot; begin offering recipes for it. In<i>Southern Food: At Home, on 
the Road, in History</i> (1987)...John Egerton writes: &quot;We have heard the 
claim that Louisianans were eating pecan candies before 1800, and with sugar 
and syrup produced from cane at that time, it is conceivable theat they were 
eating pecan pies, too, but there are no recipes or other bits of evidence to 
prove it.&quot;...If Karo did not originate pecan pie, it certainly popularized 
the recipe as a rifle through twentieth-century cookbooks large and small 
quickly suggests. Nearly all pecan pie recipes call for Karo corn syrup. The 
only clue to earlier origins for pecan pie that I've been able to unearth is 
this syrup pie recipe published in<i>From North Carolina Kitchens, Favorite 
Recipes Old and New</i> published in 1953 by the North Carolina Federation of

 &quot;Pecan Pie.</b> <br>
 Is not only delicious, 
but is capable of being made a 'real state pie,' as an enthusiastic admirer 
said. The pecans must be very carefully hulled, and the meat thoroughly freed 
from any bark or husk. When ready, throw the nuts into boiling milk, and let 
them boil while you are preparing a rich custard. Have your pie plates lined 
with a good pastry, and when the custard is ready, strain the milk from the 
nuts and add them to the custard. A meringue may be added, if liked, but very 
careful baking is necessary.&quot;<br>

 True Southern pecan pie is one of the 
richest, most deadly desserts of my knowledge. It is more overpowering than

cooked-down syrup is added the injury of the rich pecan meats. It is a favorite

<p> <b>ABOUT PECANS</b><br>
 Pecans are a &quot;new world&quot; food. They are 
indigenous to North America and were known to Native Americans long before the 
Europeans settled there. Traditionally, these nuts are connected with the 
American south where they have been incorporated into many sweet treats, 
especiallypecan pie and candy. </p> 
<p> &quot;Pecan. The most important nut of N. America, is bourne by one of the 
hickory trees, Carya illinoiensis. The hickories, which are related to walnut 
trees, include several species of edible nuts...but the pecan is much the best. 
Its native habitat is the central southern region of the USA. The name comes 
from the Algonquin Indian paccan, which denoted hickories, including 
pecans...Most pecans now some from cultivated trees, although many old, wild 
trees continue to produce nuts which are gathered and marketed. ..The main uses 
of pecans are in sweet dishes and confectionery, although they are also used in 
a stuffing for turkey. Pecan pie is one of the most famous American desserts. 
Pecan butter is also made.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan 
Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 592)</p> 
<p> &quot;Pecan. A North American nut (actually a kind of hickory nut) 
sometimes said to be a native of Oklahoma, the pecan...is really indigenous to 
an area extending from the U.S. Midwest throughout the South and Southwest into 
Mexico--a region where it still grows wild today. Pecans are commerically 
cultivated in the band of states running from Georgia west to New Mexico, as 
well as in Mexico, Brazil, and outside of the Western Hemisphere, in Israel, 
South America, and Australia. The first recorded instance of pecan cultivation 
is said to have been when Thomas Jefferson carried the trees from the 
Mississippi and gave them to George Washington. But long before this--eons 
before the Europeans arrived--pecans were an important item in the diet of 
Native Americans living in the south-central region of North America.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Pecan. The nut of the tall hickory tree native to America, ranging 
from Illinois down to Mexico...The name comes from various Indian words 
(Algonquian paccan, Cree pakan, and others) and was first mentioned in print in 
1773. Thomas Jefferson introduced the tree to the eastern shores of Virginia, 
and he gave some to George Washington fo planting at Mount Vernon. A Louisiana 
slave named Antoine was the first successfuly to graft and cultivated pecan 
trees in 1846.&quot;<br>

interesting. Various combinations of cheese and flat bread [baked and fried] 
were commonly eaten by ancient peoples. The tomato is a new world food and was 
first introduced to Europe by returning Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 
16th century. By the 17th century, tomatoes and their byproducts (sauces, 
soups) were staple ingredients of many classic southern European recipes. We 
will probably never know the name of the first person to combine and serve 
tomatoes, cheese and flat bread. Pizza as we know it today is usually 
attributed to Raffaele Esposito, who is credited for combining pizza crust with 
tomato sauce, mozzerella cheese and basil in 1889 to honorQueen Margherita 
[1851-1926]. Abouttomato sauce. 
<p> &quot;...there is no earlier evidence than third century Macedonia for the 
use of a flat loaf of bread as a plate for meat, a function which bread 
continued to perform in the pide of Turkey, the pita of Greece and Bulgaria, 
the pizza of southern Italy and the trencher of medieval Europe. Although meat 
and other relishes were seen earlier in Greece as accompaniments to cereal, the 
cereal had taken other forms.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;It has been argued that the Italians did not &quot;invent&quot; 
pizza. Perhaps this is technically true, but there can be no denying that Italy 
was most certainly the seedbed out of which the concept would flourish to the 
fullest. In one form or another, pizza has been a basic part of the Italian 
diet since the Stone Age, and Italians have devised more ways of interpreting 
the dish than anyone else...Italian pizza evolved from the basic concepts 
initiated by two different cultures: the Etrucans in the north and the Greeks 
in the south...The earliest pizza prototypes originated when Neolithic tribes 
first gathered wild grains, made them into a crude batter, and cooked them on 
the hot stones of their campfires...Italians may have made pizza famous, but 
they certainly did not invent the concept of the dish...the Greeks, who 
occupied the southernmost regions of Italy for over 600 years (from about 
730B.C. to 130 B.C.), were the greatest bakers of ancient times...Flat, round 
breads were baked with an assortment of &quot;relishes&quot; (in ancient Greek, 
a relish meant anything spread or baked on bread), such as oils, onions, 
garlic, herbs, olives, vegetables, and cheese, on tip. A rim of crust was left 
around the bread to serve as a kind of handle...&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;A pizza consists mainly of a flat disc of bread. This is normally 
the base for various toppings, and it is safe to assume that since early 
classical times people in the general region of the Mediterranean were at least 
sometimes putting a topping on their flat breads [ie foccacia]...the word pizza 
itself was used as early as the year 997 AD in Gaeta, a port between Naples and 
Rome...Abruzzi had something called pizza in the twelfth century. Calabria made
<i>pitta</i> or <i>petta</i>, Apulia <i>pizzella</i> or <i>pizzetta</i>, Sicily 
<i>sfincione</i>. Tuscany's <i>schiacciata</i>...was first roasted on stones by

modern pizzas...&quot;<br>

[Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 611)</p> 
<p> <b>Why do we call it &quot;pizza?&quot;</b></p> 
<p> &quot;The origins of its name are not altogether clear. Its extreme 
similarity to the Provencal pissaladiere, a dough base covered generally with 
onions, olives, and anchovies, would make it tempting to assume that Italian 
somehow acquired the word from French, were it not for the fact that Italian 
pizza actually denotes a far wider range of items than what English-speakers 
would recognize as pizza. Essentially it means 'pie', and this can cover for 
example a cloased fruit pie as well as the open pizza. The usual course 
suggested for it is Vulgar Latin *picea, a dervative of Latin pix, 'pitch' (in 
which case it would be an amost directly parallel formation with English 
pikelet), but it could also be related to Greek pitta.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;The term pizza is clouded in some ambiguity, though it may derive 
from an Old Italian word meaning a point, which in turn led to the Italian word 
pizzicare, to pinch or pluck. The word shows up for the first time in print as 
a Neapolitan dialect word--piza or picea--about 1000 A.D., possibly referring 
to the manner in which something is plucked from a hot oven...While many 
Mediterranean cultures and regions of Italy have long had their versions of 
flatbreads...the baked flatbread most people now think of as pizza originated 
in Naples, and was a favorite snack of occupying Spanish soldiers at the 
Taverna Cerriglio in the 17th century. The soft, baked crispy dough that the 
Neapolitans called sfiziosa would be folded over into a libretto (little book) 
and consumed in the hand. It was baked by men called pizzaioli, who worked in 
small shops called laboratori. By the middle of the 19th century the word pizza 
had become common parlance for the food item...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Pizza alla Margherita?</b></p> 
<p> &quot;...on June 11, 1889, an official of the Royal Palace asked a local 
pazaiolo named Raffaele Esposito to create a special pizza for the visit of 
King Umberto I's consort, Queen Margherita, to Capodimonte. Esposito created 
three examples, but the one most favored by the Queen was made with ingredients 
in the three colors (tricolore) of the Italian flag--red (tomato), white 
(mozzarella) and green (basil) atop the pizza dough. Esposito quickly named the 
newly fashionable pizza after the queen, and thus was born the pizza alla 
Margherita and that was to become the classic Neapolitan pizza, recognized as 
such by the Associazone Vera Pizza Napoletana (The True Neapolitan Pizza 
Association)...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Pizza in America: </b> New York traditions &amp; Chicago-style </p> 
<p> Pizza was imported to the United States by Italian immigrants. For many 
years, pizza was mostly available in cities with large Neapolitan populations 
[New York, Boston, New Haven, Philadelphia, Baltimore etc.]. It wasn't until 
American soldiers returned from WWII that pizza became a national phenomenon.
</p> 
<p> &quot;Pizza came to America at the end of the nineteenth century with 
immigrants from southern Italy. Italian immigrants built commercial bakeries 
and backyard ovens to produce bread they had eaten in Italy. In addition, 
Italian bakers used their ovens for flatbreads: northern Italians baked 
focaccia, while southern Italians made pizza. Initially, pizza was made by 
Italians for Italians, but thy the late 1930s after the Great Depression many 
Americans were eating pizza in Italian restaurants and pizzerias on the East 
and West Coasts...Over time, two basic and distinct styles of American pizza 
appeared. A thin-crust pizza, commonly called &quot;East Coast&quot; or 
&quot;New York&quot; style, is made with just a few toppings like pizza made in 
Naples...The crust of thick- or double-crust pizza, also called &quot;West 
Coast&quot; style, serves as a foundation for a larger number of 
toppings...There are several uniquely American pizzas. Deep dish, or 
&quot;Chicago style,&quot; pizza originated at Pizzeria Uno...in 
1943...California or &quot;gourmet&quot; pizza originated in 1980 at Chez 
Panisse, a restaurant in Berkeley, California.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;One of the first pizza sold in the United States was baked some 
fifty years ago by a 13-year-old pizzaiuolo named Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/2 
Spring Street in Little Italy section of New York...Pizza may never replace hot 
dogs as the great American &quot;bite,&quot; but their amazing acceptance in 
recent years prompts a question: Why pizza and not, say, Mexican enchiladas? 
The guess is that a growing number of Americans of Italian origin aided by 
advertising and refrigeration, have made pizza as delectable as such other 
postwar imports as Lollobrigida. The entertainment weekly<i>Variety</i>, going 
gastronomic the other Wednesday, reported that the &quot;extent to which the 
pizza pies are replacing hot dogs at drive-ins was demonstrated at the 
concession trade show at Allied States Ass'n convention which featured more 
pizza-making machines than frankfurter heaters.&quot; At the Texas State Fair, 
largest exhibition of its kind, pizza evoked great interest on the midway. More 
inquiries were made about pizza than any other food with the exception of the 
&quot;corny dog,&quot; the dressed-up hot dog on a stick... ...A Neapolitan 
pizzaiuolo might be startled by pizza in the United States...At a &quot;pizza 
bar&quot; in a large Manhattan department store--where thousands are absorbed 
weekly by hungry shoppers--three kinds are for sale: plain pizza (a pie); 
pizzaret (a muffin), and a best-seller called the pizza-bagel, created, after 
some protest, by a turncoat pizzaiuolo from Florida...There are fresh pizza, 
warm-over pizza, refrigerated pizza, warm-over pizza and frozen pizza, selling 
everywhere from sidearm joints to pizza palaces. (Though &quot;pizza&quot; 
means pie or pies, some Americans insist on saying &quot;pizza 
pies.&quot;)...Gennaro Lombardi seemed to be the man to turn to. Nobody has 
disputed his claim to having the oldest pizzeria in the United 
States....Gennaro said, &quot;They all came here to eat my pizza, all the opera 
stars, Scotti, Tetrazzini, Caruso...&quot;<br>

hand-stretched until it was one-quarter-inch-thick. The dough was topped with 
salt and pepper, Scamozza (Scamorza) cheese, tomatoes, grated parmesan cheese, 
and olive oil in that order. There were no ingredients for the pizza dough 
itself; instead, the reader was told that the dough &quot;can be purchased in 
any Italian bake shop.&quot;&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;While not yet a bona fide fast food, pizza was soon giving the fast 
foods run for the consumer's money. By the mid-1950s, thanks to the popularity 
of spaghetti and tomato sauce, a taste for a white farinaceous base slathered 
in thick and salty tomato sauce had become an integral part of the American 
palate. The country was therefore well primed for the invation of pizza....In 
the 1950s...pizza suddenly burst onto center stage. In part this was because it 
fit so well in the culture of the times. It was regarded as an ideal family 
food, equally acceptable to all ages and both sexes. Its taste hardly departed 
from the tried and true, yet its form could be readily accomodated to the era's 
newer, more casual way of eating: children's parties and snacking in front of 
the television set. The informal, communal way it was eaten in restaurants made 
it particualrly popular with teenagers, and by the mid-1950s boisterous 
&quot;pizza parlors&quot; dotted the main streets of Italian neighborhoods, 
their oversized booths for six or eight crammed with voracious young eaters, 
while others lounged by the entrance waiting for take-home orders...Pizza also 
became the hottest restaurant item of the 1950s because, unlike most pastas, it 
was not particularly affected by delays between cooking and eating. This made 
it ideal for the two main growth sectors in the television-battered restaurant 
industry, drive-ins and take home places. By 1956 it had shunted aside hot dogs 
as the most popular item in both. By the late 1960s, American were consuming 
two billion pizzas annually.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>New York style pizza</b><br>
 According to the food historians the 
introduction of pizza to New York City is attributed to Gennaro Lombardi when 
he opened up his pizzeria at 53 1/2 Spring Street in 1905.</p> 
<p> &quot;Legend has it that Neapolitan pizzailo Raffaele Esposito of the 
Pizzeria de Pietro was the first to make a pie with tomato, basil, and 
mozzarella pizza (the colors of the Italian flag) to honor the visit of Queen 
Margherita, consort of King Umberto I, to Naples in 1889. This thereafter was 
called pizza alla margherita and became very popular in that city.</p> 
<p> But the pizza remained a local delicacy until the concept crossed the 
Atlantic in the memories of immigrants from Naples who settled in the cities 
along the Eastern Seaboard, especially in New York City. The ingredients these 
immigrants found in their new country differed from those in the old: In New 
York there was no buffalo-milk mozzarella, so cows's milk mozzarella was used; 
oregeno, a staple southern Italian herb, was replaced in America by sweet 
marjoram; and American tomatoes, flour, even water, were different. Here pizza 
evolved into a large, sheet-like pie, perhaps eighteen inches or more in 
diameter, reflecting the abundance of the new country....The first record of a 
pizzeria in New York was Gennaro Lombardi's, opened in 1905 on Spring Street, 
but others quickly followed in the Italian communities around the city. Still, 
pizza and pizzerias and, later, pizza parlors' were little known outside the 
large cities of the East until after World War II, when returning American GI's 
brought back a taste for the pizzas they had had in Naples along with the 
assumptions that pizza, like spaghetti and meatballs, was a typical Italian 
dish, instead of a regional one.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food 
and Drink</i>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 244) </p> 
<p> &quot;The city's selection of restaurants was enriched by the arrival of 
immigrants during the late nineteenth century. The food served in the first 
Italian restaurants in the city was adapted from recipes of Naples and Sicily, 
the home of many Italian immigrants. Pizza was a Neapolitan food uncommon in 
most of Italy but popular in New York City after G. Lombardi opened a pizzeria 
on Spring Street in 1905.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>The Encyclopedia of New York City</i>
, Kenneth T. Jackson editor [Yale University Press:New Haven] 1995 (p. 1000)</p>
<p> &quot;New York pizza did not exist before 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi, a 
Neapolitan immigrant, began to sell pies in his grocery store in Little Italy. 
Lombardi's was by most accounts the first New York pizzeria, and Mr. Lombardi, 
who hired and trained a series of other immigrants, became the sturdy tap root 
of a tree of family and acquaintances that would go on to define great New York 
pizza.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Chicago-style (deep dish) pizza</b><br>
 Food historians generally 
credit Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo for the &quot;invention&quot; of Chicago's 
deep-dish style pizza. The year? 1943. The restaurant? Pizzeria Uno. Uno's 
&quot;legend&quot; here </p> 
<p> Of course, few foods are truly invented. Pizza was certainly known to 
Chicago for several decades before the Sewell's opened shop. Most are creative 
iterations of existing dishes. There is some speculation, based on the fact 
that Chicago-style pizza is thickly-topped and sometimes served in square pans, 
that the recipe was influenced by Sicilian cuisine. Did you know recipes for 
tomato pie, both open tarts and double-crust (what we now call &quot;stuffed 
pizza&quot;), were also known to American cooks in the early 19th century?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> &quot;The pizza...first made its appearance in Chicago around 1912. It was 
introduced by a man who went around with a pizza filled basket on his head...At 
that time there was some doubt whether these pizzas were to be used as shingles 
or munched.&quot;<br>

Thomas Morrow,<i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i>, August 3, 1954 (p. 18) </p> 
<p> The Windy City's first pizzeria opened at 907 Taylor St. in 1924:<br>
 
&quot;The only place in Chicago where you can buy Italian pizza is at a little 
restaurant on Taylor street near Halsted. There you can wath Tom Granato, for 
sixteen years the proprietor of Chicago's only pizzeria, concoct the delicacy 
and carefully deposit it in his big brick oven slipping it off long handled 
shovels of well sandpapered wood onto the hot bricks. The foundation of pizza 
is a dough similar to that in English muffins. To rolls out a piece the size of 
a pie crust on his marble slab, cuts up fresh Italian cheese over it, covers it 
with tomato--the little Italian pear tomato--sprinkles olive oil over it, and 
deposits it in the brick oven for a few minutes. It is served in a tin pie 
plate, cut into four sections, and eaten with the fingers. Try it with a salad. 
Young Blackie, waiter at Tom's Pizzeria Napolitana, who tells you how Tom and 
his wife, Molly, took him off the street ten years ago, made known the other 
specialties of the place--stuffed macaroni, eggplant parmigiano, and cannoli, 
an Italian dessert, with sweet, cold Italian cottage cheese served in a fold of 
ice cream cone like pastry.&quot;<br>

 ---&quot;Story of 2 Pizzerias and 1.5 Million Pizzas,&quot; <i>
Chicago Tribune</i>, July 31, 1964 (p. C6) </p> 
<p> &quot;In 1943 Ike Sewell, a liquor-company executive and former 
All-American guard from Wills Point, Tex., and Ric Riccardo Sr., an artist, 
seaman, apache dancer, and tavernkeeper born in Biella, Italy, decided to team 
up and open a Mexican restaurant in Chicago. A site was leased, and Riccardo 
began painting bullfights and cockfights on the walls. Sewell was a lover of 
and an expert on Mexican cuisine. Riccardo knew nothing about it, and there was 
no decent place in Chicago (according to Sewell) to taste it. One of Riccardo's 
bartenders, a chap named Raoul, offered to cook up a fine Mexican meal. 
Riccardo ate what Raoul had wrought and got violently ill. He painted out the 
cockfights and bullfights and left to vacation in Italy. Riccardo returned 
having stumbled upon a better idea--pizza. Sewell was the one in the dark this 
time. He had never tasted tht stuff, never even heard of it, but agreed with 
Riccardo that it should serve as a meal not just an appetizer as it was in 
Italy. They came up with a balance of cheese and sausage and spices and decreed 
that it should be used in abundance. They experimented with pans of various 
sizes and shapes and came up with the &quot;pizza-in-a-pan&quot; (some call it 
&quot;deep dish&quot;) method of cooking that yielded a crust neither 
Neopolitan nor Sicilian but something else, something brand new. And no one 
cared. &quot;At first,&quot; Sewell said, &quot;we had to cut it into little 
slivers and give it away to people who were drinking at the bar.&quot; Now, 33 
years later, Uno, together with its nearby sister, Pizzeria Due, seres 2,500 
pizzas on a big day...What Sewell and Ruccardon began has been imitated, 
perhaps improved upon...and occasionally ripped off.&quot;<br>

and Ric: They were the first with the thickest,&quot;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, 
August 1, 1976 (p. G16)</p> 
<p> &quot;Mrs. Sewell, 95, whose husband, Ike, gained fame as the co-inventor 
of deep dish pizza, died early Sunday morning at her Chicago home. Ike Sewell, 
along with partner Ric Riccardo Sr., is credited with inventing deep dish pizza 
in 1943, but Mrs. Sewell also helped concoct the pizza that put Chicago on the 
map, according to Chicago Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz, a family friend. 
&quot;If Ike was the godfather of deep dish pizza, she was the godmother,&quot; 
Wirtz said. Mrs. Sewell married Ike, a liquor company executive, in 1939, and 
in the 1940s and '50s helped him with recipes and decor for his Pizzeria Uno, 
Pizzeria Due and Su Casa restaurants.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;What is this pizza called Chicago deep-dish, and what makes it so 
different from other pizzas? In the truest sense, deep-dish pizza 
(pizza-in-the-pan is the alternate nom de pizza) is a first-generation 
descendant of what Italian-Americans commonly referred to as &quot;tomato 
pie.&quot; A sideline of Italian bakeries at the turn of the century, a tomato 
pie was baked in a large rectangular pan with 1-inch-high sides. It had a crust 
two fingers thick and a generous layer of seasoned tomato puree that was dusted 
with grated Romano cheese just before it went into the oven...Chicago-style 
deep-dish pizza came into being in 1943 when two savvy entrepreneurs, Ike 
Sewell and Ric Riccardo, opened Pizzeria Uno on the corner of Wabash and Ohio. 
It was a time when a restaurant serving only pizza was unheard of. The story 
goes that it took six months of experimentation to produce that &quot;cheese, 
tomato, and meat pie&quot; called deep-dish pizza. It was so thick that it 
required the use of a knife and fork -- which brought down another wall of 
pizza tradition: Pizza had always been something that you ate with your hands. 
Utensils to eat pizza? Incredible.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>French pizza? Oui!</b><br>
 Many people assume pizza originated in 
Italy. Certainly there is ample evidence. On the other hand? Food does not 
respected man-made political boundaries. Countries sharing common borders 
likewise share similar dishes, ingredients, and flavors. Pizza-type foods are 
popular throughout the Mediterranean region. Yes, there is French pizza. It 
flourishes in the balmy southeast region of the country. The ingredients are 
quite similar to those of neighboring Italy.</p> 
<p> &quot;Pissaladiere. A specialty of the Nice region, consisting of a flan 
filled with onions and garnished with anchovy fillets and black olives. It is 
traditionally coated with a condiment pissalat before being cooked, hence the 
name. A good pissaladiere should have a layer of onions half as thick as the 
base if bread dough is used; if flan is made with shortcrust pastry (basic pie 
dough), the layer of onions should be as thick as the flan pastry. It can be 
eaten hot or cold...Pissalat. Also known as pissala. A condiment originating 
from the Nice Region, made of anchovy puree flavored with cloves, thyme, bay 
leaf and pepper and mixed with olive oil. Originally pissalat was made from the 
fry of sardines and anchovies, but because this is not readily available 
outside the Mediterranean area, anchovies in brine may be used instead.&quot;
<br> ---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, completely revised and updated [Clarkson 
Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 899)</p> 
<p> &quot;A pissaladiere is in effect a Provencal version of the pizza. It 
consists of a base of bread dough (or sometimes fried slices of bread) with a 
savoury topping. Nowadays this is usually onions stewed in olive oil, or a 
mixture of tomatoes and anchovies, or a puree of anchovies and garlic...all 
threee decorated with black olives, but originally it would have been a mixture 
of tiny fish, typically fry of sardines, anchovies, etc., preserved in brine. 
This was known as pissala (presumably a derivative of Latin piscis, 'fish'), 
and gave its name to the pissaladiere. (Despite the striking similarity, there 
does not appear to be any direct etymologial link with Italian pizza.)&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University 
Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 258)</p> 
<p> &quot;Though the French influence is everywhere in this country, a few 
foods that are common in France have managed to escape our dragnet. The French 
pizza is one example. Yes, pizza. Although it is most often known as a 
pissaladiere, it is what it is: a round, flat bread, crisp on the bottom, 
simply garnished on top, rustic and yet urbane. Travel through the regions of 
France with your eyes open for anything that looks like pizza, and you'll come 
back impressed not only by how plentiful these pizzas are but also by their 
variety. Some, like the galette de Perouges, are sweet rather than savory. And 
many of them are served at room temperature. In fact, the pizzas of France and 
Italy, despite having different tendencies in herbs and cheese, have more in 
common with each other than they do with most of those produced here...The 
Provencal version of the pissaladiere is often garnished with two of the 
region's signature ingredients: black olives and sliced tomatoes, both in 
minuscule amounts by our standard. It is usually served at room temperature as 
often as not because in Provence, and throughout France, pizza is snack bread. 
Because it lacks gobs of cheese congealing on top, it retains its appeal even 
when cool. It is so simple--mostly just sweet onions on a wonderful crust. And 
yet it was so much more.If pissaladiere is the most familiar of the French 
pizzas, galette de Perouges is the most surprising. This is the best-known 
product of Perouges, a well-preserved and perfectly restored medieval village 
not far from Lyons. Although galette is a word used for many free-form tarts in 
France, this particular galette seems more familiar than most: a large, round 
pie, slid into an oven on a paddle and cut into crisp wedges. On closer 
inspection, however, and especially on tasting, this is no common variation on 
pizza. The crust is rich and sweet--a yeasted dough made with butter and sugar, 
and rolled nearly flat. And the topping is butter and sugar; no more. The 
galette is baked in a hot oven until the sugar caramelizes and the crust 
becomes brittle; unlike most pizzas, this dough is not chewy but crunchy. The 
tarte flambee of Alsace may be the world's northernmost indigenous and 
legitimate pizza. You see it everywhere, although it is most common in the 
north, around Strasbourg. Alsace is French, of course, but the food, language 
and appearance are quite German in character. In this regional crossroads, 
there are many variations, based largely on the background of the baker. Tarte 
flambee is a bit puffier and less flat than most pizza. Although it is usually 
spread with fromage blanc, bacon and onion before baking, there are many 
variations. There is a peculiar convention in tarte flambee: Each wedge is 
rolled from the wide crust end to its point, and the rolls are eaten end to 
end. Because French pizzas are so difficult to find outside France--and are 
among the easiest of all pizzas to make--it makes sense to try them at 
home.&quot;<br>

 &quot;If your taste runs to pizza, we have some good 
news and some bad news. As snack foods go, frozen pizza is remarkably 
nutritious. But judges by CU's test of 41 products, it isn't apt to be very 
good. We were disappointed by the crusts, taste or high bacteria counts on all 
but four brands, and we could rate those bands only Fair. Our tests centered on 
the four most popular pizza styles. We evaluate 17 brands of cheese pizza, 14 
of sausage, seven of pepperoni and three topped with hamburger. By way of 
comparison, we also bought and tested at least one sample of fresh pizza in 
each of those four styles. On average, our frozen pizzas contained a bit more 
dough than a fresh pizza of the same type, and a bit less cheese. The ran neck 
and neck in the amount of sauce. Our taste-tests indicated though, that 
liberality or stinginess with any given ingredient wasn't a reliable guide to 
eating quality...Chemical analysis indicated that the samples averaged roughly 
half water, about 30 per cent carbohydrate, 10 per cent protein and, depending 
on pizza variety, anywhere from 6 1/2 to nine per cent fat. A typical, 
four-ounce serving would provide 220 to 304 calories. So, despite their status 
as a snack food, the pizzas we checked fulfill many of the nutritional 
requirements of a main dish...pizza's balanced protein-calorie relationship, 
uncommon in a snack food, might well promote the use of pizza as a meat 
substitute in your meal now and then...Pizza's main pitch for the buyer's 
dollar is based on sensory appeal. Accordingly, CU's food technologists 
evaluated from three to six samples of each frozen pizza fro flavor, aroma, 
texture and appearance...Unfortunately, very few crusts filled the bill even 
well enought to be rated Fair...No CU food project would be complete without a 
close look at product cleanliness. We accordingly analyzed duplicate samples of 
every product for viable microbes. Our first effort was a total bactyeria count 
per gram of pizza. That's usually a pretty good indicator of a food's sanitary 
status...our findings were far from reassuring...To be fair, such a dismal 
bateriological showing doesn't necessarily mean that a food is leaving the 
factory in filthy condition. Those bacteria can thrive at freezing temperatures 
will get a chance to increase inordinately in a pizza that's mishandled or 
stays overlong in a retail showcase...A check of the pizzas for extraneous 
matter also yielded disquieting results--about 96 per cent of the samples 
tested contained some quantity of insects or insect fragments. Those unsavory 
intruders turned up in every brand, and represent a higher level of such 
contamination than we have found in any other food category...As far as taste 
goes, we think most would do well to buy a freshly cooked pizza at a pizza 
parlor they know to be good and freeze it themselves...&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Pork pies (also: </b> <b>Cheshire &amp;  Cape Breton Pork Pie)</b> 
<p> Dishing out the history of pork pies is quite the challenge for any food 
historian. The practice of encasing sweet or savory minced contents in pastry 
(aka&quot;pie&quot; dates to Medieval times. Early recipes varied according to 
culture, cuisine, and liturgical season (Lent, Christmas). They often combined 
meat with fruit (apples, raisins) and spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, etc.) 
Pork, being a versatile and common meat, was often employed as pie filling. 
From this tradition sprang two primary recipe lines: savory raised pies and 
sweet compactmincemeat dishes. Melton Mowbray Pork Pies are protected by EU 
law. Somemodern pork pies don't contain any pork at all! </p> 
<p> &quot;The British pork pie...are survivals of the medieval tradition of 
raised pies, and have changed surprisingly little. This particular pie, simply 
known as 'pork pie', is of a form distinct from other pies which merely happen 
to be made with pork. The filling is of fresh pork without other major 
ingredients, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a small quantity of herbs, 
especially sage. At Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, long famous for its pork 
pies, anchovy essence was added not only for its flavour but because it was 
thought to give the meat an attractive pink colour, while pies from other 
districts were brownish or greyish.&quot;<br>

</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2nd edition, 2006 (p. 625) 
</p> 
<p> <b>Sweet vs savoury?</b></p> 
<p> &quot;By the middle of the seventeenth century, pies had become a 
peculiarly Engish specialty; even the French were prepared to concede 
superiority. By the time [Eliza] Smith was writing, they had a long an 
honourable past, and were thus less susceptible to foreign influences than the 
made dishes at which the French were held to excel. If it is true that there 
was a parallel trend in both countries towards separating savory from sweet, it 
is not surprising that the English pies should have followed the general 
movement, but it is noticeable that they did so very much more slowly than made 
dishes. English books of the eighteenth century contain many receipts for meat 
pies with sweet and sour elements...What is perhaps the best-known English 
mixture of meat and sugar, the mince-pie, retained this combination until well 
into the nineteenth century, and survives, without the lean meat but with beef 
suet, to our own day. But even in the area of pies, the distinction between 
sweet and savory was beginning to operage and was visible in English texts 
before 1700. A sweet element, either sugar or dried fruit, was almost always 
present in Markham's receipts...The distinction between savoury and sweet pies 
did not become really obvious in the cookery books until around 1720. The cooks 
closest to French culinary practice removed the sugar entirely...E. Smith gave 
pies with chicken and with lamb in both savoury and sweet versions, but allowed 
the confustion of flavours to persist in her vegetable and mince pies--in other 
words, those where the sweet-savoury association lingered the longest.&quot;<br>

<blockquote> <b>[1861] <br>
 &quot;PORK PIES (Warwickshire Recipe).</b> <br>
 
835. INGREDIENTS.&#151;For the crust, 5 lbs. of lard to 14 lbs. of flour, milk, 
and water. For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of meat allow 1 oz. of salt, 
2&#150;1/4 oz. of pepper, a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of water. 
Mode.&#151;Rub into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put with 
sufficient milk and water to mix the crust, and boil this gently for 1/4 hour. 
Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead and beat it till perfectly smooth. Now 
raise the crust in either a round or oval form, cut up the pork into pieces the 
size of a nut, season it in the above proportion, and press it compactly into 
the pie, in alternate layers of fat and lean, and pour in a small quantity of 
water; lay on the lid, cut the edges smoothly round, and pinch them together. 
Bake in a brick oven, which should be slow, as the meat is very solid. Very 
frequently, the inexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust. 
She should bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold, or it will 
fall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be performed as near 
the fire as possible. As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary to 
raise the crust with the hand only, a glass bottle or small jar may be placed 
in the middle of the paste, and the crust moulded on this; but be particular 
that it is kept warm the whole time. Sufficient.&#151;The proportions for 1 pie 
are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs. of meat. Seasonable from September to 
March...&quot;
<p> <b>LITTLE RAISED PORK PIES.</b><br>
 836. INGREDIENTS.&#151;2 lbs. of 
flour, 1/2 lb. of butter, 1/2 lb. of mutton suet, salt and white pepper to 
taste, 4 lbs. of the neck of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered sage. 
Mode.&#151;Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the butter 
into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add a little salt. When melted, mix it up 
into a stiff paste, and put it before the fire with a cloth over it until ready 
to make up; chop the pork into small pieces, season it with white pepper, salt, 
and powdered sage; divide the paste into rather small pieces, raise it in a 
round or oval form, fill with the meat, and bake in a brick oven. These pies 
will require a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are 
made so much smaller, and consequently do not require so soaking a heat. 
Time.&#151;If made small, about 1&#150;1/2 hour.<br>
 Seasonable from September 
to March.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Pork Pies.</b>--Pork pies are generally made of the 
trimming taken from a hog when it is cut up. Make and shape the pies according 
to the directions given in the following recipe, and remember that the pies 
must be moulded while the paste is warm, and that they are much more easily 
made with a mould than without one. As a mould is not always at hand, those who 
are note particularly expriernced in the work (and it requires skill) may mould 
the pie round a jelly-pot or bottle, which has beeen made warm by beining 
immersed for some time in warm water. Cut the meat into pieces the size of a 
small nut, and keep the meat and fat separate. Season the whole with pepper and 
salt, half a dozen young sage-leaves finely shred; or a tea-spoonful of dried 
and powdered sage, one ounce of salt, two and a quarter ounces of pepper, and a 
pinch of cayenne, may be allowed for a pie containing three pounds of meat. 
Pack the fat and lean closely into the pie in alternate layers until it is 
filled. Put on the cover, press and pinch the edges, and ornament according to 
taste. Brush over with well-beaten egg, and bake in a slow oven, as the meat is 
solid and requires to be soaked thorugh. Neither water nor bone should be put 
into pork pies, and the outside pieces will be hard unless they are cut small 
and pressed closely together. The bones and trimmings of the pork may be stewed 
to make gravy, which should be boiled until it will jelly when cold, and when 
this has been nicely flavoured, a little may be poured into the pie after it is 
baked through an opening made in the top. When pies are made small they require 
a quicker oven than large ones. Time to bake, about two hours for a pie 
containing three pounds. Probable cost, 3s.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Pork Pies, Pastry for.--Put a quarter of a pound of finely-shred 
beef suet--or five ounces of lard, or a quarter of a pound of mutton suet--and 
an ounce of fresh butter into a saucepan with half a pint of boiling water and 
a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture until the fat is dissolved, and pour it 
boiling hot into a pound and a half of flour. Knead well to a stiff paste, and 
add a little more warm water if required. Shape the dough, and get it into the 
oven while it is warm. If the pie is to be baked in a mould, lay a piece of the 
proper shape in the bottom. Press long pieces into the sides, and fasten thesee 
to the top and the bottom with white of egg. If a mould is not to be used, cut 
off as much apstry as will make the cover, and wrap it in a cloth to keep warm. 
Mould the rest with both hands into the shape of a cone, and make the sides 
smooth and firm. Press the top down with the knuckles of the right hand, and 
with the left press the outside closely to keep it firm and smooth. Be careful 
that the walls are equlally thick in every part. Fill the pie, put on the 
cover, pinch the edges, fasten securely with white of egg, ornament the outside 
in any wan thay may suit the fancy, brush over with yolk of egg, and bake in a 
slow oven if the pie be large, in a quicker one if it be small.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Pork Pie, Raised.</b>--Those who kill pigs of their 
own have no trouble in obtaining suitable pie meat; those who buy it should be 
careful to get the best quality, and to see that it is free from the slightest 
taint, every slice being carefully looked over. Required: for a medium-sized 
pie, a pound and a half of pork, the same weight of paste, about a teaspoonful 
and a half of salt, or, for some, two teaspoonfuls will be none too much, 
nearly as much pepper, and herbs if approved, and a little gravy. Cost, about 
7d. per pound. The meat should be fairly fat, and is best from a bacon pig, but 
the loin or neck of pork may be used; the foreloin is preferred by many. Cut 
into dice (by means of a mincer, or by hand), the pieces bieng even in size, 
the fat and lean mixed will, and the seasoning thoroughly blended with the 
meat; the meat should be sprinkled with a spoonful of water or stock during the 
mixing, as it tends to bind it. Full directions for the raising of the paste 
will be found on page 785, and either of the reicpes on page 748 may be 
followed in making it; the medium paste is suitable. Those who possess moulds 
sometimes prefer a pork pie raisied by hand, and baked out of a mould, as the 
consider the flaour is better. The meat should be packed in firmly, and the lid 
put on after the inner edges have been egged over; the edges should be crimped 
with the paste nippers (opage 741), and leaves put round the side and on the 
lid; make a hole or two, and put a centre ornament of paste or not, as 
preferred. Then egg the pie over, and put in a good oven. (See the directions 
for RAISED PIES, page 785). This will take about two to two and a half hours; 
the latter will not be too long in most cases, and a skewer should be passed 
into the middle of the meat to test it. The gravy should be made from the bones 
and any skinny and gristly parts of the meat, seasoned as required, and 
strenghthened with gelatine or meat of a gelatinous sort; the liquor form 
boiled pork should be used in place of water at the start, should any be handy; 
supposing, for instance, the feet and ears of a pig to have been boiled, there 
is in the liquor a good foundation for the gravy of the pie. NOTE.--Should 
herbs be used, any of those named under PORK SAUSAGES in a previous chapter 
will answer; but sage is generally liked. If fresh, about half a teaspoonful 
would be enough to flavour the above for most people. Doupble the quantity of 
dried sage could be suet. We may mention that at a certain farmhouse in the 
Midlands, the pork pies are always made with layers of stoned raisins betweent 
the layers of pork. We never met with these pies elsewhere, but can recommend 
them.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Cheshire Pork Pie</b><br>
 Cheshire Pork Pie descends from the long and 
venerable line of English meat pies. Food historians traces these dishes to the 
Middle Ages, if not before. Ingredients, cooking methods and size vary 
according to place and period. The pairing ofpork and apples is ancient. 
Mincemeat pies are closely related. </p> 
<p> &quot;Cheshire Pork and Apple Pie. Since I wrote about this pie some years 
ago, readers have occasionally queried its status as a raised pe. Unless the 
pastry walls are thick, the juice burst out and spoil its appearance...So I 
returned to Hannah Glasse. Her instructions are vague, but it is placed among 
the dish pies (raised pies start six recipe later). Later in the book she gives 
instructions for a Cheshire pork pie to be made at sea, with salt pork, and 
potatoes instead of apples; and this pie is clearly a double crust pie made in 
a dish. The question remains, should the pie be eaten hot or cold? By its 
position, I would say hot, like the chicken pie before it, and the Devonshire 
squab pie that follows. But it tastes so good cold. By leaving the pie for 24 
hours, you wil find that the flavours blend together in the most delicious way.

<p> <b>Cape Breton Pork Pie</b><br>
 Food historians tell us traditional 
Europeanpork pies date to medieval times. Modern Cape Breton pork pies, 
however, are different. Why? Pork is not an ingredient. Recipes suggest this 
item evolved from themincemeat/mince pies tradition. </p> 
<p> <b>Why are they called pork pies when they have no pork?</b><br>
 
Excellent question. Up until the 20th century, lard and suet were common 
ingredients in pies and pie crusts. In the Old World beef suet was the norm. In 
the New World hogs were plentiful. It is quite likely the original Cape Breton 
pork pies employed lard from these animals. Now butter and other shortenings 
are used, thus rendering the moniker &quot;pork pies&quot; a delicious relic of 
times past.</p>

<p> The practice of making small, stuffed breads and pastries dates back to 
ancient times. The beauty of these self-contained foods was they were easy to 
cook, inexpensive, portable and could be consumed anywhere with little mess. 
Many cultures developed similar foodstuffs though the pastry/bread &amp;

<p> <b>General history notes from the food historians:</b></p> 
<p> &quot;There is reason to believe that [sanbusak] is the progenitor of the 
empanada and calzone. Sanbusak, an Arabic word that comes from the Persian 
sanbusa, meaning anything triangular, was first described as a stuffed pastry 
in the early ninth century by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim (d. 851), a well known author 
from Iraq...In a thirteenth-century Arabic cookery book of al Baghdadi, 
sanjusaj is described as a stuffed triangular pastry fried in sesame oil...By 
the thirteenth century, sanbusak appears in Spain, almost as the same recipe, a 
triangular fried pastry.&quot;<br>

<p> Craig Claiborne sums this topic nicely:</p> 
<p> &quot;Turnovers, which are festive and are almost infinate in their 
variety, also pinpoint to a degree the migrant influences in America. Just 
consider their backgrounds: There are Cornish pasties, which indicate the early 
presence of Welsh miners in Michigan, the Mexican-influenced empanadas and 
empanaditas of the West and Southwest, and the curiously named hot-ta-meat pies 
of Louisiana that indicate a borrowing from the Spanish. Even spring rolls--the 
more refined version of egg rolls, which can most certainly be classified as 
turnovers--can be found almost anywhere in the nation where Chinese chefs have 
settled. Where American history is concerned, I find the Cornish pasties the 
most interesting, not because of their flavor especially but because of the 
uses to which they have been put in this country. The concept was brought here 
in the late 1700s and early 1800s with the influx of miners from Wales...Once 
the pasties were established in this country, it did not take long for the 
non-Welsh of the region to take to them with relish and add a distinctly 
American touch...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>TURNOVERS</b></p> 
<p> Turnovers are one of the most popular examples of portable pies. Pastry 
choices range from classic Europeanpuff paste to Mediterranean filo. </p> 
<p> &quot;A turnover is a sort of small, typically individual pie or pasty, in 
which the filling is placed on one side of a piece of rolled-out pastry and the 
other side is then turned over' to cover it, forming a semicircular shape. The 
term is first recorded at the end of the eighteenth century: an old woman 
preparing her turnovers, commonly called apple-pies' (<i>Sporting Magazine</i>, 
1798). It is occasionally used for savoury fillings, such as meat, but a sweet 
fruit filling is the norm, and, as the above extract suggests, most turnovers 
are in fact apple turnovers.&quot;<br>

 The concept of fruit-filled pastry is thousands of 
years old. Kellogg's Pop Tarts descend from the venerable culinary tradition of 
personal-sizedportable pies. Our survey of historic newspapers and US Patent 
Office records confirm toaster pastries were introduced to the American public 
in 1964. Pop Tarts quickly became national icons of Baby Boomer cuisine. Why? 
They were convenient, tasty AND required no help from mom or dad. Hot or cold, 
on-the-go breakfast or late night snack, Pop Tarts were perfect.</p>

<p> <b>What were the first Pop Tart flavors?</b><br>
 According to an 
Kellogg's advertisement published in the Los Angeles Times October 28, 1965 (p. 
D15): blueberry, strawberry, apple-currant and brown sugar-cinnamon. The ad 
reads &quot;New Pop Tarts drop'em into the toaster or eat'em just as they are. 
A wonderful breakfast treat- grand for lunch or snacks too. We call 'em 
Kellogg's Pop-Tarts. Tasty, tender pastries--four kinds--each ready-filled with 
a different and luscious flavor...You'll call 'em the most convenient, tasty 
change-of-pace breakfast idea that's come along to brighten you your mornings 
in a long, long time. Six big tarts in each handy package. Baked and sealed in 
foil envelopes to stay fresh without refrigeration. A nourishing all-family 
treat for lunch boxes and after-school snacks as well as for breakfast .&quot; 
[NOTE: the ad also mentions Smuckers brand jelly and preserves was used for the 
filling.]</p> 
<p> <b>Product introduction and marketing strategy</b><br>
 Our research 
confirms Kellogg's was not the first to bring a toaster pastry to market. It 
was, however the most successful.</p> 
<p> &quot;On Feb. 16, 1964, Post unveiled its new product, Country Squares. 
The food industry oohed and aahed; the business press buzzed; grocers waited 
expectantly. And waited. But Post was slow getting Country Squares onto store 
shelves. &quot;They kept fooling around with it in our labs,&quot; recalls Stan 
Reesman, a retired Post food technician who invented the cereal Fruity Pebbles. 
In September 1964, just six months after the public unveiling of Country 
Squares, Kellogg introduced Pop-Tarts in several test markets around the 
country. Reesman insists Country Squares were superior, but he says, &quot;We 
could see the handwriting on the wall.&quot; The names given to the two 
products were one more indication of Kellogg's superior marketing savvy. 
Kellogg appreciated that kids were the primary target audience for Pop-Tarts 
because they had yet to establish breakfast habits of their own. Post seems to 
have been more confused. As awful a name as Country Squares seems in 1994, it 
was arguably worse in 1964, when the word &quot;square&quot; was widely used to 
mean &quot;nerdy.&quot; When paired with &quot;country,&quot; it seemed to 
describe a food for middle-age rubes from the sticks...Once Pop-Tarts were in 
the markeplace, Kellogg threw its full marketing muscle behind them. With huge 
revenue from its cereals at its disposal, Kellogg was sponsoring a whole zoo of 
kids' shows, includng Yogi Bear, Woody Woodpecker, Huckleberry Hound, Atom Ant, 
Bugs Bunny, Mighty Mouse and Secret Squirrel. Pop-Tarts quickly joined the cast 
of sugared cereals being hawked between cartoons. Kellogg had won the 
toaster-pastry game in the first inning. By 1967, toasted pastries were a $45 
million market, most of which belonged to Kellogg. Post's Country Squares had 
evolved into Post Toast-Em Pop-Ups, but Post finally gave up and sold the 
marketing rights in the early 1970s. General Mills' Toastwich, which had to be 
refrigerated, appeared on grocery shelves for less than a year. Nabisco's 
Toastettes, which debuted in 1967, have survived and were recently 
repositioned, according to a Nabisco spokesman, meaning they now come eight to 
a box and can be microwaved. This is not an advantage to be scoffed at; 
microwave a Pop-Tart and it resembles nuclear waste. But Pop-Tarts continue to 
dominate the toaster-pastry category, although significantly lower-priced 
generic brands are widely available.&quot;<br>
 ---&quot;Toasting of an Icon 
the Pop-Tart marks 30 Years as Part of American Life,&quot; Steve Hymon,<i>
Chicago Tribune</i>, September 25, 1994 (p. 1) </p> 
<p> &quot;After gaining market share in sales in cereal, Kellogg searched for 
related breakfast items that could both draw on and complement the recent 
success in breakfast cereals. The company settled on a food of taste and 
convenience, the toaster pastry. &quot;Toaster pastries joined the breakfast 
line-up in 1964 as Kellogg's Pop-Tarts,&quot; according to a company pamphlet. 
Pop-Tarts represented both a diversification from cereal and an expansion of 
the cereal line into a breakfast line...When Kellogg's Pop-Tarts were 
introduced, ads highlighted the item's convenience and often featured 
&quot;Milton the Toaster.&quot; Advertisements also consisted of the full brand 
name and the slogan &quot;drop em into the toaster-or eat em just as they 
are.&quot; printed across the side of the toaster with Pop-Tarts popped up. 
Pop-Tarts were marketed than and now as a food of convenience and a snack of 
nutrition...Kellogg's marketing strategy of claiming nutrition for Pop-Tarts is 
a part of the larger, historic strategy to market Pop-Tarts to adults as well 
as children. Hoping to appeal to grown-up baby boomers as well as today's 
children and adolescents, Kelloggs continues to direct marketing schemes for 
pre-sweetened cereals and Pop-Tarts to all age groups...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>CALZONES</b><br>
 Regarding the origin of calzones there are a couple 
of theories:</p> 
<p> &quot;Calzone means &quot;pant leg&quot; in Italian. Calzone are usually 
associated with Naples, where they can also be made with sausage and mozzarella 
cheese, but are found, famously, throughout southern Italy, sometimes 
deep-fried. Every town has its own variation...Carol Field, author of several 
books on Italian food, suggests that calzone may have existed in medieval Latin 
as early as 1170, according to a reference in Padua, although the historian 
Luigi Sada, also the author of several Apulian cookbooks, suggests a statute 
from Bisceglie around 1400 as being the first appearance of the word. Chef 
Carlo Middione, the author of<i>The Food of Southern Italy</i>, makes the 
plausible suggestion of a Muslim introduction in medieval Arab times. If this 
is true, then the calzone, not to mention the empanada, is related to the old 
fried pastry of the medieval Arab world, sanbusak....Sanbusak, an Arabic word 
that comes from Persian sanbusa, meaning anything triangular, which was first 
described as a stuffed pastry in the early ninth century by Ishaq ibn 
Ibrahim...a well-known author from Iraq.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>A Mediterranean Feast
</i>, Clifford A. Wright [Morrow:New York] 1999 (p. 563, 573) </p> 
<p> &quot;Calsones...a Sephardic Jewish stuffed pasta which is widely consumed 
in the Middle East. They may be square in shape like ravioli or in half-moon or 
oblong shapes. Calsones are mostly home made, using egg in the dough, and 
usually filled with a cheese and egg mixture. Calsones with reshteh were a 
famous Jewish dish in Aleppo, Syria. The calsones and reshteh were mixed 
together, dressed with melting butter, and served with yoghurt. As for the 
origins of calsones, Claudia Roden [in her book<i>The Book of Jewish Food</i>, 
1996] suggests that they came to the Aleppo community with the Italian Jews who 
left Italy at various times, beginning in the 16th century, when there was a 
mass emigration eastwards following the expulsion of Jews from Italy.&quot;<br>

Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 125) (calsone is the British spelling for calzone)</p> 
<p> <b>STROMBOLI</b><br>
 How old is stromboli &amp; where did it originate? 
Excellent questions! Italian food history books/cookbooks are curiously silent 
on this topic. This suggests an Italian-American genesis. South Philadelphia is 
generally regarded as the American epicenter for this delcious dish. Our survey 
of historic newspapers confirms stromboli piqued the palates of mainstream 
America in the 1990s.</p> 
<p> &quot;Stromboli. A sandwich made with pizza dough folded over a variety of 
ingredients, most often mozzarella and sliced pepperoni. The stromboli is a 
specialty of Philadelphia, though similar to an Italian confection called the 
calzone...The name may derive from the Italian island of Stromboli, but more 
probably refers to a very big, strong character in the fairy tale The 
Adventures of Pinocchio (1882) by Carlo Lorenzini, whose pen name was 
&quot;Collodi.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</i>, 
John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Freidman:New York] 1999 (p. 313)</p> 
<p> &quot;Stromboli is a crusty brown, overstuffed loaf dish which is popular 
in several US regions with numerous Italian-American residents. The of the term 
remains uncertain although there is a resort island near Sicily which is called 
Any stuffing can be used for such as cold cuts, cheese, roasted peppers, 
vegetables, among others. The dish is a welcome addition to Italian menus that 
usually offer pizza and pasta. Stromboli is a resort island off the coast of 
Sicily that features an active smoldering volcano. Stromboli (the dish) isn't 
that hot on this side of the Atlantic, but in Philadelphia, Providence, R.I., 
New York City, and other places with established Italian-American communities, 
it's a long-standing favorite. How the crusty brown, overstuffed loaf became 
known as &quot;stromboli&quot; is anyone's guess, since there's no food by that 
name in Italy. Perhaps the moniker was tagged on by an immigrant baker with a 
knack for marketing. What we do know about it is that virtually any stuffing 
goes--from cold cuts and cheese to roasted peppers and other vegetables--and 
that it's the ideal do-ahead food to feed a crowd or a single diner, to take 
out or eat in, and to build add-on sales. A likely forebear is the Sicilian 
'nfigghiulata antica, which Carlo Middione details in<i>The Food of Southern 
Italy</i>... It's a rolled bread filled with ground veal and pork, Swiss chard, 
cauliflower, provolone, and black olives, shaped like a crescent to recall the 
Arab domination of Sicily. We also know that stromboli can go by different 
names. Shops around New Haven, Conn., for example, make &quot;broccoli 
bread&quot; stuffed with the vegetable and Italian sausage. What distinguishes 
the stromboli from its better-known cousin calzone is its multiple-serving loaf 
shape. Calzones are more apt to take the form of individual pizza-dough 
turnovers.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>EMPANADAS</b><br>
 Empanadas are considered part of the gastronomic 
history of Spanish Galicia. The Empanada Festival is one of this region's major 
annual events. These portable pies were introduced to the &quot;New World&quot; 
by Spanish explorers and missionaries.</p> 
<p> &quot;Empanadas, meat and fish pies from Galicia, are rarely found 
elsewhere in Spain. One explanation for the popularity of empanadas in Galicia 
is that they suit the character of these northern peoples, for the pies hide 
their contents from public view, just as the Gallegos often remian aloof and 
secretive. The idea may be a bit farfetched, but there is little doubt that 
Gallegos make better meat pies than anyone else, using fillings as varied as 
the produce of Galicia. Most empanadas contain lots of onion and green or red 
pepper, in combination with meat or fish. The doughs take many different forms, 
from puff pastry to those made with cornmeal. There are other areas of Spain 
known for their pies, but these are called pasteles instead of empanadas.&quot;

Knopf:New York] 1982 (p. 52)<br>
 [NOTE: Ms. Casas mentions on p. 64 of this 
book that Empanada de Lomo (pork pie) is the most commonly prepared Galician 
pie.]</p> 
<p> &quot;Empanada. A Spanish and Latin American savoury turnover. Empanada' 
means covered with bread'; and bread dough may be used, but the usual covering 
is shortcrust pastry. Often the semicircular seam is decorated by twisting it 
at regular intervals. The pastry may be baked or deep fried. Fillings vary from 
one country or region to another. In Spain a mixture of minced meats and 
sausage is common, but in writing about empanadas in Galicia Janet Mendel [<i>
Traditional Spanish Cooking</i>, Garnet Publishing, 1996] lists no fewer than 
18 examples of fillings, ranging from clams to rabbit, sardines to pigeon, and 
octopus to ham. In S. And C. America and the southwest of the USA a similarly 
wide range of fillings are used. Mexican fillings are highly seasoned with 
chilli peppers.&quot;<br>

 Personal portable pies, Louisiana-style! </p>

borrowing from the Spanish...One of the most interesting of all turnovers is 
the pastry-filled fried food that I dined on in a town in Louisiana called 
Natchitoches (the name is pronounced Nacky-tosh). These spicy turnover were 
once referred to as hot-ta-meat pies, but now they're simply called 
Natchitoches meat pies. The most famous in town are served at a small 
restaurant called Lasyones. I am certain these pies are very much related to 
empanadas and came about through the influence of Spanish settlers in the 
state. The are decidedly un-French.&quot;<br>

(p. C8)<br>
 [NOTES: (1) Mr. Claiborne's recipe here. (2) Lasyone's is </p> 
<p> &quot;The meat pie's origins are shrouded in history, lost in the days 
when Indian met Spaniard in the forests around the oldest settlement in the 
Louisiana Purchase. But James Lasyone is sure of at least two things. People 
were making and selling meat pies around Natchitoches when he took his first 
steps off the farm nearly half a century ago. And today he sells nearly 160,00 
of the delicacies every hear. 'My family was sharecroppers,' said Lasyone, who 
started Lasyone's Meat Pie Kitchen with a one-eyed gas stove and a single iron 
pot. 'We walked into town on Saturdays and there would be people with little 
carts, pushing them up and down the street. I talk to people that's much older 
and as far back as they can remember they've had meat pies. But until I opened 
my kitchen here, people made them in their homes and sold them in their homes.' 
The Meat Pie Kitchen in an old downtown strip along the Cane River has become 
something of a landmark in recent years--a haven for busloads of tourists, as 
well as for travelers armed with ice chests for long-distance takeout orders. 
'Travel agencies call us from all over the United States...We have buses booked 
year-round.'...According to Lasyone, the meat pies are tasty--even to strangers 
from Boston, Spokane or Sault Ste. Marie. 'First they want to see one...They of 
course they still don't know anything. But 95 percent will take the meat pie 
lunch and the majority are well pleased with it.' Like Col. Sanders and others 
who found a recipe for success, Lasyone is tight-lipped about exactly what goes 
into his product. He will let on that 50 pounds of beef is mixed with 10 pounds 
of pork, that the fried pastry is something between a turnover and a taco and 
that a Louisiana-style dark gravy is added to the mixture at the end of the 
cooking process. Beyond those slivers of guidance, however, Lasyone is 
silent...Despite his sense of ownership, Lasyone insisted he was not interested 
in shepherding his meat pies to fast-food fame...'I would rather for someone 
else to buy the recipe...Making meat pie is really a job. It requires a lot of 
time and careful handling. It's really a big thing. If you'd just see one 
laying there on the plate, you wouldn't think it was that much trouble.'...The 
initial burner and pot, which cost $6.95, have evolved into a restaurant with 
three dining rooms capable of seating 100.&quot; ---&quot;Natchitoches meat pie

name is sambosa, and in the Turkish-speaking nations, where is its called 
samsa...it is made both in half-moon shapes and triangles. Sedentary Turkish 
people such as the Uzbeks and the people of Turkey itself usually bake their 
samsas, but nomads such as the Kazakhs fry them...These pastries were still 
made in Iran as late as the 16th century, but they have disappeared from most

<p> &quot;Sanbusak...There is reason to believe that this preparation is the 
progenitor of the empanada and calzone. Sanbusak,an Arabic word that comes from 
the Persian sanbusa, means anything triangular, was first described as a 
stuffed pastry in the early ninth century by Isaq ibn Ibrahim (d. 851), a 
well-known author from Iraq. In al-Masudi's (died c. 956) Meadows of Gold, 
there are foods described that sound like early sanbusak. The twelfth-century 
dietetic manual, the Liber de ferculis et condimentis, which was translated 
from the Arabic...In the thirteenth century Arabic cookery book of 
al-Baghdadai, sanbusaj is described as a stuffed triangular pastry fried in 
sesame oil. Another early written recipe for sanbusaq appears in the 
thirteenth-century cookbook attributed to Ibn al-Adim (d. 1262, the Kitab 
al-wusla ila l-habib fir wasfi al-tayyibat wat-tib, where it is described as a 
small half-moon of puff pastry stuffed with cheese, chopped meat, or 
qaymaq...By the Thirteenth century, Sanbusak appears in Spain, almost as the 
same recipe, a triangular fried pastry. Sanbusak are possible, although not as 
likely, the origin of the Turkish borek and therefore the origin, too, of the 
savory pastries, the Tunisian brik, Algerian burak, Moroccan briwat, and the 
Armenian beoreg, as well as Spanish, Greek, Italian, and Sicilian 
versions.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Samosa. A deep-fried snack, consisting of a crisp, triangular and 
layery wheat casing filled with spiced meat or vegetables. In about AD 1300 
Amir Khusrau describes, among the foods of the Muslim aristocracy in Delhi, the 
'samosa, preapred from meat, ghee, onion, etc.'. About fifty yearsl later Ibn 
Battuta calls it a samusak, describing it a s 'minced meat cooked with almonds, 
walnuts, pistachios, onions and spices placed inside a thin envelope of wheat 
and deep fried in ghee'. The<i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> lists, among dishes of meat 
cooked with wheat, the qutab, 'which the people of Hind call the sanbusa'. All 
these descriptions suggest that the amosa was not an item brought by these 
courts from their parent lands, but was an existing indigenous product, perhaps 
enriched in its stuffing to cater to royal courts.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Cream puffs &amp; eclairs</b> 
<p> Choux a la creme, profiteroles and cream puffs are said to have originated 
in Renaissance France and Italy. Choux paste is different from other types of 
pastry because when cooked, it rises and the finished product has a hollow 
center. As was the custom of the day, these holes were variously filled with 
sweet or savory fillings. Cream puffs, as we know them today, are usually 
filled withcustard or French cremes. Chocolate (as a glaze or filling) was an 
18th century addition.</p>

<p> &quot;Choux pastry is said to have been invented in 1540 by Popelini,

century was indubitably [Antonin] Careme...&quot;<br>

</p> 
<p> <b>These are the facts:</b> </p> 
<p> &quot;The real creation of choux paste is complex and cannot be 
established with any certainty, not least because its manufacture is a 
relatively simple process and it is possible that it was independently created 
in many places and at various times. In principle, choux paste requires only 
four ingredients: water, fat, flour and egg. The incorporation of an egg into 
what is effectively hot-water paste--and a fairly obvious innovation for an 
inquisitive cook--would produce a kind of choux paste. Tracing early cookery 
receipts is beset with difficulties, not least because authors heedlessly 
repeat foundation-myth andedotes. Elizabeth David, writing about the Florentine 
cooks that Catherine Medici was said to have brought with her to France in 
1533, states, &quot;Those cooks...are part of a myth originating in 
mid-nineteenth-century France, perhaps in the imagination of of of the popular 
hsitorical novelists who flourished at that period, and certainly without 
existence in historical fact...Researchers are also faced with establishing the 
meaning of archaic terms and technical expressions. The nomenclature of of 
cookery is complicated not only by difficulties in establish early usage, but 
also by the lack of conformity of usage, not helped by the idiosyncrasies of 
early-modern spelling. A single cookery method or culinary product may be 
concealed under a whole variety of labels or (conversely and just a confusing) 
a single term may apply to one or more different methods or receipts. Such 
etymological considerations--a focal point for most investigations by cookery 
historians--bear upon choux...pastry...Historically, we find at least two 
pastries referred to as 'choux'. It seems likely that the earliest use of the 
term in England was by was of imported translations of French 
seventeenth-century cookery books. In La Varenne's<i>The French Pastry Cook</i> 
of 1656, the reader is told of 'The manner how to make a little Puff-paste 
Bunns, called in French Choux.' But this paste is neither the puff-paste so 
beloved by French and English cooks from the sixteenth century or earlier--and 
known in France as pate feuilletee and in England as butter pasted and puff or 
puft paste--nor is it what today we would recognize as choux paste. The 
ingredients for La Varenne's reciept includes a fist-size of fresh 
cheese...bruised with a little flour, two eggs, a further handful of flour or 
salt. When mixed, this is spread 'as thick as a finger', baked in two pieces 
and, once cooked, spread with butter, sugar and rosewater. The two pieces are 
sandwiched together and warmed in the oven, then decorated with sugar and 
preserved lemon. La Varenne also writes about this type of paste made into 
morsels the size of small eggs. So here the term 'choux' seems to apply to both 
paste and to the small buns made from this paste. With a little imagination, a 
round cooked choux bun, or fritter, resembles the shape of a small cabbage. 
With this bun shape--choux being French for cabbage--we can see (literally) the 
reason for the name of the paste. These cheese-based pastes can be traced back 
to at least the thirteenth century where similar receipts for fritters appear 
in anonymous Andalusian cookbooks...Massailot's ingredients for 'Benioles', or 
Petit Choux, are simliar to La Varenne's...In England one of the several 
meanings of the words 'chou' and 'puffs' is amost identical to that of La 
Varenne's and Massailot's 'choux' paste. Cotgrave, as early as 1611, describes 
'petit chou' as 'puffe-cake, or loafe, made of butter, cheese, fine meal, and 
yolks of egges.' He tells us that there are two kinds, 'one round, and plumpe 
like an apple; the other also round, but much flatter'...in 1706 'petits choux' 
crops up in Edward Phillips' dictionary,<i>New World of English Words</i>, 'a 
sort of Paste for garninshing made of fat Cheese, Flower, Eggs, Salt, etc. 
bake'd in a Pye-pan, and Ic'd over with fine Sugar'...there are several 
receipts found in early European cookbooks and manuscripts that broadly refer 
to what today's cooks call 'choux paste,' or what we have referred to as 
'twice-cooked' pastry. The original French name was pate a chaud...Importantly, 
the second cooking of these pastries results in the formation of a pouch or 
pocket--ideal for filling with savoury of sweet mixture. In sixteenth- and 
seventeenth-century England there were other words that sometimes (but by no 
means always) denoted a choux paste product, including 'benets'...'puffs' and 
certain types of 'fritters'...Certainly the idea of cooking a paste of flour, 
butter and liquid and then adding eggs to produce a small puffed pastry cake 
was known to some French cooks at the start of the seventeenth century...But 
choux paste, though by other names, can be found in even earlier books and 
manuscripts. Perhaps the earliest extant English receipt if found in<i>A Book 
of Cookrye</i> (1591) first published in 1584. The ingredients for 'Benets' or 
&quot;Bennets'( a kind of fritter) are practially identical to those fo John 
Eveyln's 'French Fritters.'...The refined French name for these French Friters 
is 'Beignets Souffles'...Eveyln tellus us that these fritters are of French 
origin, and this may well be so. However, we can find several receipts 
recognizable as choux paste in the German cook Sabina Welserin's manuscript of 
1553. They are more explicit than any contemporary French manuscripts and 
indicate long-standing familiarity with the technique. One hazards a guess that 
it originated independently of Queen Catherine's Popelin, or that it derived 
from an earlier common source...Most of the earliest receipts for choux paste 
are for fritters...The term 'choux' had not settled down [in the 18th century] 
to today's meaning...Today, the terms 'Cream Bun or Puff', 'profiterole' and 
'choux' seems to have settled down; the ambiguity no longer an issue.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Choux pastry is a thick batter made from flour, milk, butter, and 
eggs. Its most typical application is in the making of small round buns (as 
used for profiteroles) known in French as choux, literally cabbages, from their 
shape--hence pate a choux, the pastry used for making them. The first reference 
to the term in English comes in the 1706 edition of Edward Phillips's<i>New 
World of English Words</i>: Petits Choux, a sort of paste for garnishing, made 
of fat Cheese, Flour, Eggs, Salt, etc., bak'd in a Pye-pan, and Ic'd over with 
fine Sugar.' But it was not really until the late nineteenth century that it 
achieved any sort of general currencey in English.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;From the sixteenth century onwards convents made biscuits and 
fritters to be sold in the aid of good works...Missionary nuns took their 
talents as pastrycooks to the French colonies. The nuns of Lima had a great 
reputation after the sixteenth century, and chocolate owes a great deal to the 
convents. The puff pastries called feuillantines were first made in the 
seventeenth century in a convent of that name...Sugar and chocolate had now 
arrived on the scene; from the time of Louis XIV onwards those delicacies 
became extremely popular...Gastronomy flourished in the nineteenth 
century...Fauvel, a chef working for the famous pastry cook Chiboust, invented 
the Genoese sponge and also had a hand in the creation of the gateau 
Saint-Honore, so called in honour of the patron saint of pastrycooks. It is 
garnished with choux pastry puffs, and choux pastry is also used in making 
eclairs and choux a la creme, and a kind of chocolate eclair known as the

<p> &quot;Profiteroles are small round choux-pastry buns with a filling. This 
can be either savoury or sweet, but by far the commonest manifestation of the 
profiterole is with a cream filling and a covering of chocolate sauce, and 
piled in large quanitities, in the more ambitious type of restaurant, into a 
sort of pyramid. The word originated in French as a diminutive form of profit, 
and so etymologically means 'small gains'--and indeed it may to begin with have 
denoted a 'little something extra' cooked long with the master's main dish as a 
part of the servants' perks.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>About eclairs</b><br>
 The food history encyclopedias (including the <i>
Larousse Gastronomique</i>) and reference books all describe eclairs but 
provide little if any details regarding their origin. This probably means the 
eclair is a product of food evolution. There is some conjecture that perhaps 
Antonin Careme (1784-1833), a famous pastry chef for French royalty might have 
created something akin to eclairs. The<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> traces 
the term &quot;eclair&quot; in the English language to 1861 &quot;Vanity Fair

<p> </p> <b>Pot pie</b>
<p> &quot;Pot pies&quot; descend from medieval savory meat pies. In early 
cookbooks, &quot;pot pie&quot; was generally described the cooking method. It 
was not an acutal recipe title.</p>
<p> &quot;Pot pies are as old as pastry-making itself. In the royal households 
of France and England, savory tarts were among a chef's most elaborate 
dishes...Sad to say, pot pies seem a relic of an age of family restaurants 
where a cook actually took his time to make such items--before such restaurants 
were conglomerated and homogenized. The last steamy gasp of the traditional pot 
pie may well have been the arrival of the frozen pot pie in supermarkets of the 
early 1950s, which made the idea of making one at home or in a restaurant 
obsolete, despite the lack of fresh flavor...Pot pies are as old as pastry 
making itself. And in the royal households of France and England, savory tarts 
were often among the most elaborate of dishes in a chef's repertoire, 
especially during the Elizabethan era, when the crusts would be decorated with 
heraldic devices, flowers, and curlicues of painstaking skill. Inside might be 
anything at all, including the famous &quot;four-and-twenty blackbirds&quot; or 
even a small child (unbaked and uneaten, I assure you). In America, where far 
more households had baking ovens than in Europe, the tart became known as the 
pot pie by the end of the 18th century, and was a fixture of American kitchens. 
In most cases it referred to a casserole dish topped with a pastry crust rather 
than to a mixture of ingredients baked in a pastry crust, so that the casserole 
could easily be hung above the fire or set on a grid to be baked by indirect 
heat. They were particularly welcome at church suppers because they were so 
easy to transport and were very festive at any family table.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>About chicken pot pie</b><br>
 Primary evidence suggests recipes for 
chicken pot pie (in concept, but not name) were known in England as far back as 
the Middle Ages. As one would expect, these early meat pies were quite 
different from ones we know today. Robert May's<i>Accomplist Cook</i> [1685] 
lists several recipes for poultry pies (chicken, turkey, pheasant etc.). These 
generally still relied on Medieval flavors: pepper, salt, nutmeg, orange juice, 
lemon, chestnuts, mace, sugar, gooseberries, barberries, grapes etc. Vegetables 
were sometimes employed.Pennsylvania Dutch Slippery Pot Pie follows a similar 
recipe, except for the medieval spicings.<br>

<p> <b>Slippery Pot Pie</b> (Pennsylvania Dutch/Maryland)<br>
 &quot;The 
Pennsylvania Dutch know this more commonly as Hinkelboi, not 'chicken in a 
blanket,' the literal sense of the original German. Although Hinkelboi is 
technically similar to a Pennsylvania Dutch chicken Botboi (pot pie) and may 
even tasted like one, it must not be confused with the true Botboi, a baked 
stew thickened with large, flat noodles. Here, the chickens are simply encased 
in a crust. Many Pennsylvania Dutch also call the pot pie noodles Botboi, which 
adds a layer of confusion to the evolution of this dish. Nevertheless, both 
Hineklboi baked in a pot and chicken Botboi have a common ancestor. The meat 
pie, after all, is nothing more than a stew or casserole in a crust, hence the 
infinite variations. We tend to associate meat pies with English cookery, but 
they were also known in medieval Germany. Originally, German meat pies were 
commonly made of fish for consumption during times of religious fasting, but 
gradually, beef and pork pies gained in popularity. However, not having their 
own term for meat pies, the Germans borrowed pastete from the French as early 
as the fourteenth century. Thus, chicken pie became Huhner-Pastete. 
Technically, a proper German Pastete must have an upper crust; otherwise, to 
the Pennsylvania Dutch, it would fall into the category of a tart of Kuche, 
like pumpkin pie. To safeguard the distinction, many Pennsylvania Dutch use the 
term Boi, from English pie; for any sort of meat pie, hence Hinkelboi... As 
daily fare, meat pies were enormously popular with the Pennsylvania Dutch 
because they made use of leftovers or poorer grades for meat. They could be 
baked head and reheated or warmed over the next day. They were an ideal meal 
for travelers and were often served to field hands during their breaks.&quot;

<p> <b>What made it &quot;slippery?&quot;</b><br>
 Slip engraving was a 
traditional decorative technique used on earthenware pottery. Pie plates were 
the most popular. Presumably there is a connection.<br>
 &quot;Artistically 
considered, the ornamental earthenware of the Dutch potteries follows the lines 
of earliest known European potteries, and its 'slip-decoration' or 'sgraffito' 
which was developed in Southern Europe, particularly in Engalnd and in Italy. 
As the Romans inaugurated slip decoration during the time that there was a 
larte Roman colony in the Palatinate on the Rhine wehre the Dutch came friom, 
it is faily clear that the Dutch sgraffito ware derives from the early Roman 
days. France copied the art from the Germans, and so did 
England...Slip-engraving is...a treatment consisting of entirely covering the 
outer surface of the utensil with the slip of clay, and then etching on it the 
design. The Dutch in America added new values to the art, including the use of 
a vivid green by means of copper or verdigris...The pie plate, or poi schuessel 
was the most general article of sgraffito work, and the most widely 
distributed. The pie has always been a great favorite of teh Dutch, sharing 
this preference with New England...The Dutch...made a wider variety of pies 
than any other group in America...The reason why the sgraffito poi scheussel or 
pie plate of earthenware was so much used was because of the Dutch ovens so 
generally in use. When the Pennsylvania Dutch hausfrau baked her bread on the 
Dutch oven hearth, she was able, without any additional fuel cost, to bake pies 
also in the same oven at the same time. Tin pie plates being sccarce or 
non-existent in the early days, her need resulted in earthen pie plates; and 
her collection of poi schuessel became a source of pride to her. The potter 
took note and slip-decorated the pie plates.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>ABOUT EARLY PUMPKIN COOKERY</b><br>
 Recipes for stewed pumpkins 
tempered with sugar, spices and cream wrapped in pastry trace their roots to 
Medieval cuisine. We find several period European/Middle Eastern recipes 
combining fruit, meat and cheese similarly spiced and presented. The Columbian 
Exchange [16th century] flooded the &quot;old world&quot; with &quot;new 
world&quot; foods. These new foods (pumpkins, potatoes, tomatoes, peanuts, corn 
etc.) were incorporated/assimilated/adapted into traditional European cuisines, 
each in their own way and time. Culinary evidence confirms it took several 
generations before many &quot;new world&quot; foods were accepted by the 
general public. Pumpkins seem to have skipped this honeymoon period. They were 
similar to &quot;old world&quot; gourds and squash, and superior in flavor. 
They were also just as easy to cultivate. As such, pumpkins (aka pompions) were 
embraced almost immediately.</p> 
<p> If pumpkins are a &quot;New World&quot; food, why are they sometimes 
listed as ingredients in Medieval European recipes? If you notice, these 
references are usually found in Medieval cooking books with modernized recipes. 
The original recipes simply call for squash or gourds. Why substitute pumpkin? 
Some Medieval recipes for members of the curcurbit family (gourds, calabash, 
cucumbers, melons) are more palatable to contemporary tastes if you make them 
with pumpkin. It's also readily available.</p> 
<p> &quot;3. Winter Squash or Pumpkin Soup...The curcurbits are a large, rich 
family including cucumbers, melons, and squashes. But the Old World knew 
neither the winter squash (Curcurbita pepo) nor the pumpkin (Curcurbita 
maxima), both of which were brought from the Americas. If we can trust the 
title of the recipe, Congordes, and if we think of the depictions of squash 
(zucche) harvests in the many manuscripts comprising the Tacuinum sanitatis--a 
medical treatise of Arab origin that lists the medicinal properties of various 
foods--the cook is probably dealing here with gourds (Lagenaria vulgaris). 
These came originally from southern Asia, and were well known in Western Europe 
in the Middle Ages. But without fresh gourds to hand, you can prepare this soup 
with winter squash or pumpkin.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;As for pumpkin pie, in particular, in sixteenth- and 
seventeenth-century England &quot;people of substance&quot; were familiar with 
a form of pumpkin pie that both followed the medieval tradition of &quot;rich 
pies of mixed ingredients&quot; and also bore resemblance to the consumption of 
apple-stuffed pumpkins typically engaged in by people of lesser 
substance...Pumpkin pie went out of fashion in Britain during the eighteenth 
century. Perhaps Edward Johnson reflected this emerging attitude in the 1650s 
when he offered as a sign of New England's progress toward prosperity the fact 
that in most households people were eating &quot;apples, pears, and quince 
tarts instead of their former Pumpkin Pies.&quot; Pumpkin had been superceded 
by the more civilized fruits (free of association with the natives), of which 
the settlers had first been deprived. Such an anticipation that pumpkin pie was 
on the way out was premature, as far as the developments on this side of the 
Atlantic were concerned.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Among vegetables, the Northeastern Indians made particularly lavish 
use of squash, even more than other American Indians, and especially of 
pumpkin. Both squash and pumpkin were baked, usually by being placed whole in 
the ashes or embers of a dying fire (in the case of squash, the acorn and 
butternut varieties were preferred) and they were moistened afterwards wtih 
some form of animal fat, or maple syrup, or honey; and both were also made into 
soup. When pumpkin was made into a soup, it often underwent some enriching 
which converted it into something more like a stew. A seventeenth century 
Oneida recipe specified that pumpkin should be &quot;boiled with meat to the 
consistency of potato soup.&quot;<br>

 The earliest 
European recipes for pumpkin pie appear in the 17th century. They are titled 
&quot;pompion.&quot; The early English use of the word &quot;pompion&quot; 
(French for &quot;pumpkin&quot;) may imply these recipes originated in France.

your pumpkin, so that it will be more thickened than ordinary, then fry a 
chibol with butter, and put it in with salt, and serve with pepper.&quot; (p. 
213)<br>
 [NOTE: potage is akin to soup] 
<p> <b>&quot;Potage of pumpkin with milk.</b><br>
 After it is well sod, pass 
it through a straining pan, and leave not much broth in it, because of the milk 
which you must put in it. When it is well seasoned with milk and a little 
butter, stove or soak your bread, and serve with pepper if you will.&quot; (p.

with this manner. Take sliced apples sliced thin round ways, and lay a layer of 
the froise, and a layer of apples with currants betwixt the layers. While your 
pie is sitted, put in a good deal of sweet butter before your close it. When 
the pie is baked, take six yolks of eggs, some white-wine or verjuyce, and make

<p> </p> <b>Quiche</b> 
<p> The practice of baking sweet and savory dishes composed of eggs, cream, 
and spices in pastry shells is ancient. Quiche, as we know to today, evolved 
from Ancient Roman patinea (cheesecake) and Medieval European tarts. </p> 
<p> Medieval recipes for a  Tart in Ember Day (Ember day was a Christian 
meatless day) and Tart de Bry  quite resemble modern quiche. </p> 
<p> Food historians place the modern recipe for quiche in (what is currently) 
the Lorraine region of France. In medieval times, this area was known as 
Lothringen, a Germanic kingdom.</p> 
<p> &quot;Quiche. An open tart filled with a mixture of beaten eggs, creme 
fraiche and pieces of bacon, served hot as a first course or hors d'oeuvre. 
Originating on Lorraine (the name comes from the German &quot;Kuchen,&quot; 
meaning cake), it has become a classic of French cuisine and is also widely 
enjoyed in other countries. Its origins go back to the 16th century; in Nancy, 
where it is a specialty, its local name is feouse. Quiches used to be made from 
bread dough, but now shortcrust or puff pastry is used. In some parts of 
Lorraine any pastry tart filled with migaine (eggs and cream) mixed with 
onions, cream cheese or pumpkin is called a quiche, and elsewhere quiches can 
be made with cheese, ham, bacon, onion, mushrooms, seafood and various other 
ingredients.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Larousse Gastronomique</i>, Completely Revised 
and Updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 957)</p> 
<p> &quot;A quiche is a pastry cooked a cooked savoury custard containing 
items such as vegetables, bacon, or cheese. It is a specialty of the 
Alsace-Lorraine region, which has been bandied between France and Germany over 
the centuries, and the term quiche itself is a French verison of kuche, a word 
from the German dialect of Lorraine...The authentic quiche Lorraine contains 
only smoked bacon in adition ot the cream-and-egg custard, but many alternative 
versions have grown up that include cheese and onion.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A-Z 
of Food &amp; Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 
274-5)</p> 
<p> &quot;Quiche. A French [dish]...most prominent in Lorraine...It was only 
at the beginning of the 19th century that the term became current, and it then 
meant a tart with a filling of egg and cream...The version now well known, 
which includes bacon (and sometimes cheese) in the filling, was originally a 
variant known as quich au lard. Whereas the original could be eaten on meatless 
days, this variant--now known around the world as quiche Lorraine--could not. 
Nonetheless, a quiche Lorraine is perceived as something with only a slight 
meat content. This may account for the reputation it acquired in some 
English-speaking countries, where it only became familiar in the latter part of 
the 20th century, as a dish not suitable for &quot;he-men&quot; or &quot; real 
men.&quot; At the end of the 20th century the quiche has become the subject of 
innuerable variations...&quot;<br>

issue of<i>Gourmet</i>, Donald Aspinwall Allan praised the appetizers because 
&quot;there is always a good quiche,&quot; including onion, ham, leek, or 
anchovy and olive. Restaurants and caterers soon learned that while quiche was 
both a popular and hearty appetizer, it was also sturdy, and could be held for 
hours...Quiche's enduring popularity into the Seventies had a great deal to do 
with the scope it allowed creative cooks. As one<i>Bon Appetit</i> reader 
commented, while inquiring after the recipe for the moussaka quiche...served at 
The Cottage Crest in Massachusetts, &quot;There seems to be no end to culinary 
imagination when it comes to making quiches.&quot;...<i>Gourmet</i> (Octyober 
1971) even published a recipe for cranberry-carrot dessert quiche to be served 
with whipped cream. Plain old quiche Lorraine--with cheese, of course--was 
still around, but it was generally considered much too boring...By the early 
Eighties Americans had been served too many quiches...Even Craig Claiborne, 
quiche's early promoter, decared that he wouldn't be caught dead serving 
it.&quot;<br>

other no-bake recipes made popular during the Great Depression. There are 
dozens of recipe variations. Pinapple is one of the perennial favorites. Crusts 
range from standard pastry shell to crushed cracker (graham) and cookie 
(gingernaps, vanilla wafers, chocolate wafers) crumbs. The recipe ingredients 
some folks list are comglomerations of various brand products made by competing 
companies (Jell-O is Kraft; Hydrox is Sunshine) so it is unlikely the recipe 
was printed on the back of a box. Similar recipes, however, using Oreos or 
Famous Chocolate Wafers, might have been on a box. This explains why some folks

 &quot;An innovation in cookery, which offsets 
every possibility of failure and offers a light, dainty, fluffy dessert, fit to 
be set before the most fastidious taste, is the sunshine ice box pie. Begin by 
making the family's favorite pie crust or the regulation of one of 1 cupful of 
flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of shortening, 1/2 teaspoonful of salt and enough ice 
water to mix. Line a deep pie pan and bake in a slow oven so as to dry out the 
pastry. When it is light brown remove it from the stove to cool. To make the 
filling, separate the yolks and whites of 4 eggs. Beat yolks and whites 
separately. To the whites add 1/2 cupful of sugar and beat until very stiff. To 
the yolks and 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and a grated rind of 2 lemons, a 
pinch of salt and 1/2 cupful of sugar. Dissolve for 5 minutes 1/2 tablespoonful 
of gelatine in 1-3 cupful of cold water. Place the yolk mixture in a double 
boiler, stirring constantly until the liquid is thickened and creamy. Remove it 
from the fire and add the gelatin. Fold the pie crust and set it in the ice box 
until time to serve. Just before serving spread the top of the pie with a thin 
layer of whipped cream. This pie keeps for days.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Pie is always acceptable as a dessert no matter 
what the season. We are sometimes reluctant about serving it in warm weather 
bcause we dislike to heat the oven. This is no longer an excuse for not having 
it because there are the uncooked varieties, the ones which require no heat. 
They are sometimes called refrigerator pies. Refrigerator pies usually have 
crumb crusts. Corn flake crumbs are excellent for this purpose. They have a 
good color and add a distinctive flavor. The crust may be made in two different 
ways.&quot;<br>

in 3 tablespoons cold water. Then turn this into 1/2 cup boiling water in the 
top of double boiler, and stir till dissolved. Next stir in 4 tablespoons 
sugar. Let mixture cool. Then add 1 cup strained orange juice and 1 tablespoon 
strained lemon juice. Put some ice water in bottom of double boiler and set the 
top part into it. Let stand till mixture starts to set. Then beat with rotary 
beater with rotary beater. Next fold into the mixture 1/2 cup of diced orange 
and 2 egg white beaten stiff. For the crust to this pie, use either vanilla 
wafers or gingersnaps. Crush or grind enough of them to make a thick layer of 
crumbs in the bottom of the pie plate. Line the sides of the plate with wafers 
broken into halves (round side out) with more crumbs between the wafers. Then 
turn in the fruit mixture. and place in the refrigerator to set. This will take 
about 4 hours. But there'll be no harm done if you want to make this pie the 
night before. And in case you'd like to use berries in place off oranges 
that'll be good, too. Just substitute the same amount of berries and 
juice.&quot;<br>
 ---&quot;Refrigerator Cakes and Pies Eliminate Baking 
Drudgery,&quot; Ann Barrett,<i>Washington Post</i>, August 1, 1933 (p. 9) </p> 
<p> &quot;Cheers! Also a couple of tigers! For we just peered into the 
refrigerator and mother is baking a pie! No fooling. It's a real refrigerator. 
Also, it's a real pie. it went in soft and soupy. it's coming out tremblingly 
firm, enticingly fluffy--the most palate teasing morsel yet to call itself pie. 
And the answer--the newly arrived family of refrigerator pastries that is 
setting the town buzzing and taking the floor even from the absorbing matter of 
jigsaws. The delicate backbone--if one day apply such a sturdy name to such a 
quivering creating--is gelatin. But the result is like no gelatin dessert yet 
on the books...Chiffons and cream pies start out the list, but lemon chiffon 
has now taken to itself relatives. Coffee chiffon, and chiffons glorified with 
crushed pineapple or fresh spring strawberries shiver with glee as they are 
turned into crisp, baked shells and slid into the refrigerator to be 
&quot;cold-baked&quot; to a cut-able firmness. For refrigerator pies (except 
for the pre-baked crust) never see the oven. Some of the ingredients do, 
however, get acquainted with the top of the stove. And of the coffee chiffon, 
served up with hot chocolate, demi-tasse, or even a cup of tea, as a light, 
relieving touch after a robust meal, is, to me, the perfect selection...gelatin 
isn't the only way we have of putting standupableness into the new era of 
refrigerator pastries. Another pie--or it may be turned into a whole family of 
tarts--stands up because someone discovered that lemon juice thickens condensed 
milk...&quot;<br>

 &quot;&quot;Give us more refrigerator cakes and 
pies&quot; some of my readers have begged. So today I am persenting one of 
those fluffy-as-a-cloud chiffon pies which looks ok, so hard to make, but 
actually requires no cooking at all! You will win instant fame as a cook when 
you sevre this one, and you can take the bows with a chuckle up your sleeve 
knowing it is easier that &quot;pie.&quot; Refrigerator pies can be made in a 
pastry shell, which, of course, is baked before the filling it put in. This pie 
today, is made in a crumb shell, which is much easier. Crumb shells can be made 
of dry, crisp cereals, vanilla wafers, graham crackers or dry cake crumbs. 
Simply roll the cereal, crackers or crumbs fine, and to 1 cup of crumbs add 1-3 
cup softened butter and 1-4 cup sugar. Press firmly on sides and bottom of 
buttered pie plate and chill. Filling:</p> 
<p> <b>Fruit Chiffon Pie.</b><br>
 1 tablespoon gelatin<br>
 1-4 cup cold water
<br> 1 1-2 cups diced fruit<br>
 3-4 cup fruit juice<br>
 1-2 cup sugar<br>
 1 
tablespoon lemon juice<br>
 1-8 teaspoon salt<br>
 1-2 cup whipping cream<br>
 
Sprinkle gelatin over cold water and allow to soften. Combine fruit, juice and 
sugar, cook about 5 minutes. Stir in gelatin, lemon juice and salt. Chill. When 
mixture begins to thicken, fold in cream which has been whipped stiff. Pour 
into pie shell, and chill until well set.<br>
 Note: Fresh uncooked pineapple 
will not congeal in gelatin mixture. There are lots of things you can do with 
fresh pineapple, but for molded desserts and salads you will have to use cooked 
or canned pineapple. Almost daily some imaginatie and enterprising woman phones 
to ask why her gelatin will not congeal, after hs she has put fresh pineapple 
in it. It just won't.&quot;<br>

<p> </p> <b>Shepherd's pie</b> 
<p> The English tradition of meat pies dates back to the Middle ages. Game 
pie, pot pie and mutton pie were popular and served in pastry 
&quot;coffyns.&quot; These pies were cooked for hours in a slow oven, and 
topped with rich aspic jelly and other sweet spices. The eating of &quot;hote 
[meat] pies&quot; is mentioned in<i>Piers Plowman</i>, and English poem written 
in the 14th Century. (<i>Cooking of the British Isles</i>, Adrian Bailey, pages 
156-7) The Elizabethans favored minced pies. &quot;A typical Elizabethan recipe 
ran: Shred your meat (mutton or beef) and suet together fine. Season it with 
cloves, mace, pepper and some saffron, great raisins and prunes...&quot; (<i>
Food and Drink in Britain: From the Stone Age to the 19th Century</i>, C. Anne 
Wilson, page 273). Aboutmince and mincemeat pies. </p> 
<p> The key to dating Shepherd's pie is the introduction (and acceptance) of 
potatoes in England. Potatoes are a new world food. They were first introduced 
to Europe in 1520 by the Spanish. Potatoes did not appeal to the British palate 
until the 18th Century. (<i>Foods America Gave the World</i>, A. Hyatt Verrill, 
page 28). Shepherd's Pie, a dish of minced meat (usually lamb, when made with 
beef it is called&quot;Cottage Pie&quot;) topped with mashed potatoes was 
probably invented sometime in the 18th Century by frugal peasant housewives 
looking for creative ways to serve leftover meat to their families. It is 
generally agreed that it originated in the north of England and Scotland where 
there are large numbers of sheep--hence the name. The actual phrase 
&quot;Shepherd's Pie&quot; dates back to the 1870s, when mincing machines made 
the shredding of meat easy and popular.&quot; (<i>The Oxford Companion to Food
</i>, Alan Davidson, page 717). </p> 
<p> <b>Where does &quot;Cottage Pie&quot; fit in?</b></p> 
<p> &quot;In present day English, <i>cottage pie</i> is an increasingly 
popular sysnonym for<i>shepherd's pie</i>, a dish of minced meat with a topping 
of mashed potato. Its widening use is no doubt due in part to its pleasantly 
bucolic associations, in part to the virtual disappearance of mutton and lamb 
from such pies in favour of beef...But in fact,<i>cottage pie</i> is a much 
older term than<i>shepherd's pie</i>, which does not crop up until the 1870s; 
on 29 August 1791 we find that enthusiastic recorder of all his meals, the 
Reverend James Woodford, noting in his diary Dinner to day, Cottage-Pye and 
rost Beef' (it is not clear precisely what he meant by<i>cottage pie</i>, 
however).&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A to Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford 
University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 92)</p> 
<p> &quot;The term cottage pie, often confused with shepherd's pie but 
probably denoting a similar dish made with minced beef, has a somewhat longer 
history and is similarly effective in evoking a rural and traditional

<p> <b>[1894]<br>
 &quot;Cottage Pie</b><br>
 Required: a pound and a half of 
cooked potatoes, half a pound to three-quarters of cold meat, seasoning and 
gravy as below. Cost, about 9d. The potatoes must be nicely cooked and mashed 
while hot...The should be seasoned, and beaten until light with a wooden spoon. 
A pie dish should then be greased, and the potatoes put at the bottom, to form 
a layer from half to an inch in thickness. The meat should be made into a thick 
mince of the usual kind with stock or gravy...or it may be mixed with Onion 
Sauce, or any other which may be sent to table with meat. The nicer the mince, 
the nice, of course, will be the pie. The meat goes next, and should be put in 
the centre of the bottom layer, leaving a little space all around. Then drop 
the remainder of the potatoes on the top, beginning at the sides--this prevents 
the boiling out of the gravy when the meat begins to cook--go on until all the 
used, making the pie highest in the middle. Take a fork, and rough the surface 
all over, because it will brown better than if left smooth. For a plain dish, 
bake it for fifteen to twenty minutes. Or it may be just sprinkled with melted 
dripping (a brush is used for this), or it may be coated with beaten egg, part 
of which may then be used in the mashed potatoes. As soon as the pie is hot 
through and brown, it should be served. There are many recipes for this pie, or 
variation of it, and in some, directions are given for ptuting the meat in the 
dish first, and all the potatoes on the top. The plan above detailed will be 
found the better, because the meat being enveloped entirely in potatoes runs no 
risk of becoming hard, as it wold do it exposed to the direct heat of the oven. 
Any other cooked vegetables may be added to the above, but they should be 
placed between the meat and potatoes, both top and bottom. If a very savoury 
pie is desired, make the mince very moist, and allow longer time for baking. 
The potatoes will absorb some of the gravy, and found tasty. In this case, the 
heat must not be fierce at starting, only at the end for the pie to brown well. 
For a richer pie, allow a larger proportion of meat. For a very cheap one, half 
a pound of meat will do for two pounds of potatoes.&quot;<br>

New Universal Cookery Book</i>, Lizzie Heritage [Cassell and Company:London]

<p> <b>&quot;Tinned Meat, Shepherd's Pie</b><br>
 Required: two pounds of 
meat, half-a-pint of canned tomatoes, half-a-pound of fried onions, salt and 
black pepper, and any herbs preferred, four pounds of potatoes, and some gravy. 
Cost, 1s. 6d. To 1s. 8d. First grease a deep baking dish with some of the 
melted fat from the tin. Boil or steam the potaotes, mash and season them 
...and put them in an inch thick at the bottom and sides of the dish. Then put 
the onions all over the potato layer. Mince the meat, add the jelly from it, 
and the tomatoes, with a little more stock or plain gravy of any sort; pile 
this in the centre of the dish; put the remainder of the potatoes thickly on 
the top; rough the surface with a fork, and bake until well browned in a 
moderate oven about three-quarters of anhour. The potatoes will absorb some of 
the gravy and be very savoury. The dish is an excellent one, considering its 
small cost. If liked, some pork can be added, and apple sauce used instead of 
the tomatoes. Tinned ox-tails, ox cheek, kidney, &amp;c., may take the place of 
the beef or mutton. Either will provide a hot, cheap meal in a short time.&quot;

<p> <b>Shoofly pie</b></p> 
<p> Shoofly pie has such an interesting name, it must have an equally 
interesting history. It certainly does!</p> 
<p> Many food history reference books attribute the origin of shoofly pie to 
the Pennslyvania Dutch. A closer examination of culinary evidence suggests this 
group may be able to claim the name, but maybe not the recipe. This resiliant 
sugar-based formula is capable of adapting through the ages according to 
ingredient availability and cook ingenuity. Food historians tell us 
sugar-filled pastries originated in the Ancient Middle East. Sweet treacle pies 
were popular all over Medieval Europe. Renaissance diners preferred similar 
compostions made with fine white sugar. These recipes were introduced to 
America by European settlers from several nations. Molasses was often 
substituted for treacle in colonial American recipes. Some folks say the 
&quot;original shoofly recipe&quot; is descended from Centennial cake. Both 
desserts have striking similarities.</p> 
<p> <b>WHY SHOOFLY?</b> According to the book <i>Rare Bits, Unusual Origins of 
Popular Recipes</i>, by Patricia Bunning Stevens (p. 262) shoofly pie was 
created when &quot;the pie-loving Pennsylvania Dutch ...found themselves short 
of baking supplies in the late winter and early spring...all that was left in 
the pantry were flour, lard, and molasses. From these sparse ingredients they 
fashioned Shoo-Fly Pie and found that their families liked it so well that they 
soon made it all year round. The unusual name is presumed to come from the fact 
that pools of sweet, sticky molasses sometimes formed on the surface of the pie 
while it was cooling, inevitably attracting flies.&quot; According to the<i>The 
Encyclopedia of American Food &amp; Drink</i>, by John Mariani (p. 293) the 
term &quot;Shoo Fly Pie&quot; was not recorded in print until 1926.</p> 
<p> &quot;Shoofly pie.<br>
 In American cuisine, shoofly pie is a sort of 
treacle tart, made with molasses or brown sugar and topped with a sugar, flour, 
and butter crumble. It's name is generally taken to be an allusion to the fact 
that it is so attractive to flies that they have to be constantly shooed away 
from it, but the fact that it originated as a Pennsylvania-Dutch specialty 
suggests the possibility that shoofly is an alteration of an unidentified 
German word.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>An A-Z of Food and Drink</i>, John Ayto [Oxford 
University Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 310-1)</p> 
<p> <b>WHAT IS AMISH SHOOFLY?</b><br>
 There are two basic variations on the 
traditional Amish Shoofly Pie recipe.&quot;Traditional&quot; Shoo-fly pies are 
made with either a &quot;wet bottom&quot; (soft filling and crumb topping) or 
&quot;dry bottom&quot; (crumb topping is mixed into the filling), which is 
commonly served for breakfast.&quot;</p> 
<p> If you are looking for a Shoo-Fly pie recipe from the early 18th century, 
try this one from &quot;<i>The Thirteen Colonies Cookbook</i>,&quot; by Mary 
Donovan. On page 135 appears this recipe attributed to Magdelena Hoch Keim of 
Lobachsville, Pennsylvania. (1730--?). This recipe has been modernized for 
contemporary kitchens:</p> 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> <b>Wet-Bottomed Shoofly Pie</b> <br>
 3/4 cup Flour <br>
 1/2 cup 
brown sugar<br>
 1/2 tsp cinnamon <br>
 1/8 tsp each nutmeg, ginger, and ground

 1/2 cup barrel molasses <br>
 3/4 cup boiling water <br>
 1/2 
tsp baking soda<br>
 Piecrust dough for 9-inch pie 
<p> Combine flour, sugar, spices, and salt with the shortening. Work into 
crumbs with your hands. Add beaten egg yolk to molasses. Pour boiling water 
over soda until dissolved; then add to molasses mixture. Line a 9-inch pie 
plate with pastry and fill it with the molasses mixture. Top with the crumb 
mixture. Bake at 400 degrees until the crust browns, about 10 minutes. Reduce 
to 325 degrees and bake firm.</p> </blockquote> <br>
 Original recipes for 
&quot;molasses pie&quot; read like this:
<p></p> 
<blockquote> Four eggs--beat the Whites separate--one Teacupful of brown

vegetables with sweeteners, spice and cream were known in Medieval Europe. 
Carrots were sometimes employed in this manner in England.Sweet potatoes (like 
pumpkins) were introduced to Europe in the 16th century. Food historians tell 
us these new vegetables were greatly prized by some European kings and queens.

<p> &quot;King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella may have liked [sweet potatoes] 
well enough to have planted them in their court gardens. Their son-in-law, 
Henry VIII of England, liked them too, he thought the plant was an 
aphrodesiac...Rareness and expense, besides that quality Henry VIII 
appreciated, lent it chic. Also, &quot;the most delicate root that may be 
eaten,&quot; as the sixteenth-century English mariner and slave trader John 
Hawkins called it, suited European taste. ..Henry ate his sweet potatoes in 
heavily spiced and sugared pies, a fashion that survived at least until the 
1680s.&quot;<br>

similar to yams (&quot;Old World&quot; foods) and quickly incorporated into the 
local cuisine. Sweet potato pie seems to have converged in the American South 
from very early colonial days. It quickly became a staple of the region. Today 
this fine pie is considered by some to be a cornerstone of &quot;Soul

<p> <b>Why are sweet potatoes pies sometimes served with marshmallows?</b><br>

 During the late 19th/early 20th century marshmallows were very trendy. 
Mass-manufactured, plentiful and inexpensive, they were agressively promoted by 
food companies. Campfire Brand is one of the oldest. Marshmallows were 
incorporated into cakes, pies, gelatin desserts, hot chocolate, candies, and 
the like. Marshmallows were promoted as a moden whipped cream substitute. About 
marshmallows. The earliest recipes we find combining sweet potatoes (&amp; to a 
lesser extent, yams) with marshmallows date to the 1920s. According to these 
recipes, marshmallows were layered casserole-style or placed on top of the 
finished dish for decoration. Candied yams were sometimes served with 
marshmallows. Coincidentally, many signature dishes of the 1920s were 
exceptionally sweet. Some food historians hypothesize this was a tasteful 
reaction to Prohibition.</p> 
<blockquote> <b>[1921]</b> <br>
 &quot;I sometimes serve sweet potatoes in 
this way: Pare and boil medium-sized sweet potatoes until tender and remove and 
place in a pan in this way: One layer of the sweet potatoes, sliced; a little 
sugar sprinkled over the slices, a thin layer of marshmallows cut into small 
pieces, and then another layer of the sliced sweet potatoes--and so repeat the 
order of these layers till the dish is full; finish with the marshmallow layer. 
Set the dish in the oven and let bake until the marshmallows melt and are brown 
on top.&quot;<br>

Century. There bear striking resemblance in both ingredients and method to 
pompion (pumpkin) pies of the 17th century. Aboutpumpkin pie. Early potato pie

grouped with desserts. Culinary evidence reveals a variety of different ways 
for making these pies. Did the early cooks use &quot;sweet potatoes&quot; or 
were white potatoes that were sweetened? It's difficult to determine from the

<p> <b>ABOUT YAMS AND SWEET POTATOES</b><br>
 Although both yams and sweet 
potatoes edible starchy tubers, they evolved from two totally different plant 
species. True yams are Old World (there is one varietal exception) and sweet 
potatoes are New World (Peru). The confusion between these two is said to be 
attributed to linguistics. When Europeans introduced the sweet potato to 
Africa, (already familiar with yams), native cooks gave this similar-looking 
vegetable the same name.</p> 
<p> &quot;The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and the yams (genus Dioscorea) 
are root crops that today nurture millions of people within the world's 
tropics. Morevever, they are plants whose origin and dispersals may help in an 
understanding of how humans manipulated and changed specific types of plants to 
bring them under cultivation. Finally, these cultivars are important as case 
studies the diffusion of plant species as they moved around the world through 
contacts between different human populations...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>WHY THE CONFUSION BETWEEN YAMS &amp; SWEET POTATOES?</b> </p>

<p> &quot;It was probably slave traders who introduced the sweet potato to

---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University 
Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 775)</p> 
<p> &quot;The confusion with the true yam came from the habit of slaves 
calling the American sweet potato by an African word (either Gullah njam, 
Senegal, nyami, or Vai, djambi) meaning &quot;to eat.&quot; The word was first 
recorded in America in 1676.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, not remotely related to either 
the white potato or true yam) is native to tropical America and is mentioned in 
1494 as growing in Hispaniola by Chanca, physician to the fleet of Columbus, 
according to Sturtevant. The confusion started with potato, from Haitian batata 
(<i>OED</i>), came to be applied no only to sweet potatoes but also to papas, 
an Inca name for white potato, thus endlessly entangling their identities in 
early chronicles. Gerard in his<i>Herball</i> (1597) correctly identified them: 
sweets, already well known in England, he called simply Potatoes, saying that 
they grew in &quot;...Spaine, and other hot regions.&quot;<br>

member of the morning glory family...There are many different varities, ranging

<p> <b>ABOUT YAMS</b><br>
 &quot;Yams existed at least as far back as the 
beginning of the Jurassic era, when dinosaurs had not yet been succeeded by 
mammals and S. America and Asia were still joined. After the continents 
separated at the end of the Cretaceous era, the evolution of American yams 
proceeded separately, but they are still not much different from their Old 
World relatives. The differences between Asian and African yams, which were 
separated only in historic times by the drying up of the intervening land, 
Arabia, are also slight...Even within the main cultivated species, yams vary to 
a remarkable extent in size, shape, and colour...The origin of the word 
yam'...story goes the Portuguese slave traders, watching Africans digging up 
some roots, asked what they were called. Failing to understand the question 
aright, the Africans replied that is was something to eat', &quot;nyami&quot; 
in Guinea. This became &quot;inhame&quot; in Portuguese and then 
&quot;igname&quot; in French and &quot;yam&quot; in English.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>
The Oxford Companion to Food</i>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University 
Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 856)</p> 
<p> African yams enjoy a rich and interesting history, figuring prominently in 
cultural traditions. &quot;Dioscorea cayenesi&quot; is the principal species 
grown in West Africa. The African name for this vegetable is &quot;allato.&quot;
</p> 
<p> &quot;While much emphasis had been placed on cereal cultivation, there is 
increasing evidence that tubers also played an important role in African diets 
as well and seem to date back to 18,000 to 17,000 years ago. Yams became so 
important within the western section of the continent that they took on 
mythical proportions. Festivities mark their planting and harvesting in 
countries like Ghana and Nigeria...It is generally agreed upon by botanists 
that certain species of yams were first protected and later domesticated in the 
tropical rainforest zone of western Africa...&quot;<br>

<p> <b>ABOUT SWEET POTATOES</b><br>
 &quot;Sweet potato...the most important 
of the tropical root crops, is the starch tuber of a vine of the concolcus and 
morning glory family. It is not related to the ordinary potato, although both 
plants are of American origin. The sweet potato is the cultivated descendant of 
a wild plant, the remais of whose tubers have been found in a cave in Peru 
inhabited before 8000BC. It was taken into cultuvation during the last 
centuries BC, well before th etime of the Incas, and became a staple food all 
over tropical America as far north as Mexico and on the Caribbean islands. It 
is likely that it was during the 13thc century AD that the sweet potato was 
taken westward to Easter Island and Hawaii, and in the next century to New 
Zealand...The first European to taste sweet potatoes were members of Columbus' 
expedition to Haiti, in 1492...Early accounts give various local names, aji, 
camote, apichu, and others; but the name which stuck was the first known 
Haitian one, batata...Native American sweet potatoes in use at that time were 
not all sweet. Some were plainly starchy and others markedly fibrous...But the 
European explorers were interested only in the sweet kinds, and it is these 
which have been spread by European influence while the others have largely died 
out...The sweet potato was cultivated in the south of Spain from the early 16th 
century, and proved a popular novelty...On the North American mainland sweet 
potatoes had long been grown by the Indians in Louisiana, where de Soto found 
them in 1540, and as far north as Georgia. By 1648 the colonists in Virginia 
were cultivating them. The sweet potato was especially valued during the war 
against the British and the Civil War, for it grows quickly and its underground 
habit makes it less vulnerable than surface crops to deliberate 
destruction.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Shakespeare's sweet potatoes</b> </p> 
<p> &quot;All recipes for potatoes were for sweet, or Spanish potatoes. The 
white, or Virginia, potato so-called because Sir Walter Raleigh brought it back 
to England from Virginia, or so it was thought, was barely known during 
Shakespeare's lifetime. Spanish potaotes, introduced by the Spaniards, who 
found them in South America, were known in England around the middle of the 
sixteenth century. William Harrison mentions them in the 1577 edition of<i>The 
Description of England</i>, but recipes for them do not appear in English 
cookbooks until the 1580s, when Thomas Dawson offered the recipe, much quoted 
by social historians of Tudor England, on how 'to make a tart that is a courage 
to a man or woman.' The recipe combines potatoes with the brains of cock 
robins, among other ingredients, making it clear to Elizabethans that it was a 
dish with aphrodesiac possibilities. The aphrodesiac reputation of cock 
robbins' brains and sweet potatoes was accepted by educated people as well as 
by the medical profession. Sir Thomas Elyot in his<i>Castle of Health</i>, does 
not mention robins, but notes that 'sparrowes be hard to digest, and are very 
hot, and stirreth up Venus, and especially the brains of them.' Shakespeare 
mentions potatoes twice, both times with lecherous connotations.&quot;<br>

 Like their white 
potato [Virginia] cousins, sweet potatoes were introduced to North America via 
Europe.
<p> &quot;Sweet potato...A vine native to the New World tropics...They are an 
important crop of the American South...The earliest records of the cultivation 
of the sweet potato, dated to around 750 B.C., come from Peru, but it was grown 
throughout South and Central America by the time Christopher Columbus arrived 
in the New World...The Taino word batata was soon transformed into several 
European words, including the Spanish patata, French patate, and English 
&quot;potato.&quot; These words first meant specifically the sweet potato, not 
the white potato that was introduced much later to the North American 
colonies...The sweet potato, meanwhile, had already been shipped back to the 
Old World, perhaps as early as 1493 in Columbus's ship, and was cultivated in 
Spain by the middle of the sixteenth century. England got its first taste of 
the tuber in 1564, when Sir John Hawkins brought it back from &quot;the Indies 
of Nova Hispania,&quot;...the term &quot;sweet potato&quot; was not in use in 
America until the 1740s, but then distinguished from the white potato that had 
come to Boston about 1719 with Irish immigrants...In the nineteenth century 
George Washington Carver devised more than a hundred uses for the sweet 
potato...By the 1800s American were enjoying candied sweet potatoes, along with 
less lavish preparations of boiled, roasted, or mashed tubers. Today some of 
the most popular market varieties include &quot;Centennial,&quot;

<p> <b>Tarts</b><br>
 Food historians tell us tarts were introduced in 
Medieval times. Like pies, they could be savoury or sweet. Generally, the 
difference between a tart and a pie is the former does not contain a top crust. 
This made tarts a popular choice for cooks who wanted to present colorful 
dishes.</p> 
<p> &quot;The term 'tart' occurs in the 14th century recipe compilation the 
Forme of Cury [a cook book], and so does its diminutive 'tartlet'. The relevant 
recipes are for savour items containing meat. A mixture of savour and sweet was 
common in medieval dishes and typical of the elaborate, decorative tarts and 
pies which were served at banquets. There was, however, a perceptible trend 
towards sweet tarts. These usually contained egg custard and fruits of various 
kinds, which could be used to provide the brillant colours of which medieval 
cooks were fond: red, white, and pale green from fruits; strong green from 
spinach, which was used in sweet tarts; yellow from egg, with extra colour from 
saffron; and black from dark-coloured dried fruits. There are many 16th century 
recipes for coloured tartstuffs'.&quot;<br>
 ---<i>Oxford Companion to Food</i>
, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 785)</p> 
<p> &quot;Tart...In America, the word tart tends to indicate a small 
individual open pastry case with a sweet, usually fruit filling. In Britian, 
this usage survives in the particular context of jam tarts, but on the whole 
tart refers to a larger version of this, with jam, fruit, or custard filling, 
that is cut into slices for serving, or to a similar fruit-filled pastry case 
with a crust--in other words, a fruit pie.&quot;<br>

Apple and orange tarts are an excellent choice for a Shakespearean feast. The 
recipe, however is much older. Pie was made by ancient cooks. Apples were 
introduced to England by the Roman conquerors. They were commonplace by the 
16th century. Oranges came later, in Medieval times. These were expensive items 
in Shakespeare's age because they were imported. Therefore, only the wealthy 
could afford apple and orange tarts. Recipes for apple and orange tarts appear 
in 16th century English cookbooks. Coincidentally? These cookbooks were also 
written by and for the wealthy. Example?Pear tart</p>

<blockquote> <b>[1747]<br>
 &quot;To made different Sorts of tarts</b> <br>
 
If you bake in tin Patties, butter them, and you must put a little Crust all 
over, because of the taking them out: If in China, or Glass, no Crust but the 
top one. Lay fine Sugar at the Bottom, then your Plumbs, Cherries, or any other 
Sort of Fruit, and Sugar at Top; then put on your Lid, and bake tem in a slack 
Oven. Mince-pies must be baked in Tin patties; because of taking them out, and 
Puff-paste is best for them. All Sweet Tarts the beaten Crust if best; but as 
you fancy. You have the Receipt for the Crusts in this Chapter. Apple, Pear, 
Apricock, &amp;c. Make thus: Apples and Pears, pare them, cut them in Quarters, 
and core them; cut the Quarters a-cross again, set them on in a Sauce-pan with 
just as much Water as will barely cover them, let them simmer on a slow Fire 
just till the Fruit is tender; put a good Piece of Lemon-peel in the Water with 
the Fruit, then have your Patties ready. Lay fine Sugar at Bottom, then your 
Fruit, and a little Sugar at Top; that you must put in at your Discretion. Pour 
over each Tart a Tea Spponful of Lemon-juice, and three Tea Spoonfuls of the 
Liquor they were boiled in; put on your Lid, and bake them in a slack Oven. 
Apricocks do the same Way; only don't use Lemon. As to Preserved Tarts, only 
lay in your preserved Fruit, and put a very thin Crust at Top, and let them be 
baked as little as possible; but if you would make them mice, have a large 
patty, the Size you would have your Tart. Make your Sugar-Crust, roll it as 
thick as a Halfpenny; then buter your Patties, and cover it; shape your 
Upper-crust on a hollow Tin of purpose, the Size of your Patty, and mark it 
with a Marking-iron for that purpose, in what Shape you please, to be hollow 
and open to see the Fruit through; then bake your Crust in a very slack Oven, 
not to discolour it, but to have it crisp. When the Crust is cold, very 
carefully take it out, and fill it with what Fruit you please, ay on the Lid, 
and it is done; therefore if the Tart is not eat, your Sweet-meat is not the 
sorse, and it looks genteel.&quot;<br>

salt every other day for a fortnight; then boil them for two to three hours

thin as you can; then take pippins pared, cored and quartered, and a pint of

orange or lemon, half the pippins well broken, and a pound of sugar; boil these 
together a quarter of an hour; then put it in a gallipot, and squeeze and 
orange in it if it be lemon, or a lemon if it is orange; two spoonfuls are 
enough for a tart; your pattipans must be small and shallow; put fine

<p> <b>ABOUT APPLES IN ENGLAND</b><br>
 &quot;The Romans introduced new 
economic plants. The had already developed several apple varieties, with fruits 
smaller than those of today but larger and sweeter than those borne by 
Britain's indigenous wild crabs...Their apple varieties included types for good 
keeping, and villa owers stored them spread out in rows in a dry, 
well-ventilated loft...Apples were sliced into two or three pieces with a redd 
or bone knife (since metal stained the fruit), and were put to lie in the 
sun.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>ABOUT ORANGES IN ENGLAND</b><br>
 &quot;The first Englishmen to enjoy 
oranges, lemons...were probably the crusaders who wintered with Richard 
Coeur-de-Lion in the fruit groves around Jaffa in 1191-2. About a hundred years 
later citrus fruits had begun to arrive in England itself. Fifteen lemons and 
seven oranges, together with two hundred and thirty pomegranates and some dried 
fruits were brougth from a Spanish ship at Portsmouth in 1289 for Queen 
Eleanor...The Southern fruits were very expensive at that time...The oranges 
that reached England in those days were always bitter, of the type of the 
Seville orange. From the end of fourteenth century the consignments became more 
frequent, coming in from Spain or Portugal, or on the Italian spice ships. Not 
only were citrus fruits themselves imported, but also confectionery made from 
them.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;The same ships that carried spices also tended to carry fruit, such 
as oranges, of which a surprising number were brought to England. These were 
frequently imported in the tens of thousands per ship, and occasionally as many 
as a hundred thousand (in March 1480). These oragnes were probably always a 
bitter variety. For customs purposes they were declared at about ten for 
1d.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Besides the food associated with certain occasions there was luxury 
food which was served whenever it could be obtained and which was intended to 
delight and impress. One such food was fruit. A better-off person's meal in the 
sixteenth century finished with fruit...Henry VIII's meals also ended with 
fruit, although exactly what fruit is not specified apart from the fact that 
oranges and pippins (a variety of apples) are often included on the menu. 
Ordinary people could also enjoy the fruit they grew in their own gardens, but 
imported luxuries like oranges were far beyond their means.&quot;<br>

 Arguably, the most famous of all French 
tarts! Happy accident or stroke of genius? You decide...</p> 
<p> &quot;Tarte Tatin, an upside-down French apple tart. The <i>Larousse 
Gastronomique</i> explains that the name commemorates the Tatin sisters, who 
popularized it in their restaurant at Lamotte-Beuvron, to the south of Orleans, 
in the early 20th century. Later in the century, chefs devised variations, 
using pear, pineapple, or rhubarb, to give but three examples.&quot;<br>

<p> &quot;Tatin. The name given to a tart of caramelized apples that is cooked 
under a lid of pastry and then inverted to be served with the pastry underneath 
and the fruit on top. This delicious tart, in which the taste of caramel is 
combined with the flavour of apples cooked in butter under a golden crispy 
pastry crust, established the reputation of the Tatin sisters, who ran a 
hotel-restaurant in Lamotte-Beuvron at the beginning of the 20th century. 
However, the upside down' tart, made of apples or pears, is an ancient 
specialty of Sologne and is found throughout Orleanais. Having been made famous 
by the Tatin sisters, it was first served in Paris at Maxim's, where it remains 
a specialty to the present day.&quot;<br>

[NOTE: The original Larousse Gastronomique (1938) contains information on apple 
tarts but does not make reference to Tarte Tatin.]</p> 
<p> &quot;...How these Tatin girls accidentally inventd the famous tart 
involves a small sally into French social history. The Solognes region is the 
paradise of French hunters, a wild, forested area along the upper reaches of 
the Loire River, near Joan of Arc's City of Orleans...The hunters come with 
dogs and guns to spread out along the forest roads that pass isolated villages 
where they stay in small hunting auberges. Most of these tiny inns are owned 
and run by women who are also superb game cooks... In one of the villages, 
Lamotte-Buevren, about 24 miles from Orleans, the Auberge Tatin has been owned 
by the Tatin family for almost 70 years. The most famous cooks in the family 
were the Tatin sisters Marie and Jeanne, who ran the auberge about 40 years 
ago. As well as their game specialties, they had a dessert that was quite 
popular with regular visitors. You might call it a kind of deep-dish one-crust 
fruit pie. They made it in a copper pan about 9 inches across and 3 inches 
deep. They neatly filled it with circles of fruit cut, covered it with a single 
pastry crust, put a lid and baked it by sliding it under the glowing wood 
embers in the huge hearth. When the crust was golden brown, they carried the 
pie in its pan to the table. One day, just as she stepped into the dining room, 
Marie Tatin dropped the pan. The pie stayed in the pan, but the crust cracked 
badly right across its center. In a flood of tears, Marie scooped up the pan 
from the floor and rushed it back to the kitchen. It obviously could not be 
served with the big crack. There was no time to bake another. What could be 
done? Jeanne had the brilliant idea that was to make them famous. Quickly she 
ran a knife around the edge of the crust and overturned the entire pie onto a 
serving platter with the cracked crust underneath. The fruit, now on top, 
looked very neat, but a bit pale. In a heavy iron skillet Jeanne quickly 
caramelized some butter and sugar, then dribbled the shiny golden syrup over 
the fruit. When Marie carried the newly invented upside-down tart into the 
dining room, it we recieved with acclamation. Within a few months, it was being 
copied all over the Sologne region. Within a few years, it was a favorite all 
over France. For the rest of their lives the Tatin sisters basked in the glory 
of their tart. Thousands of visitors came to their tiny auberge, not to hunt 
but just for the pleasure of meeting the sisters and looking at the circle 
painted on the floor to mark the spot where the tart fell. Yet the Tatin girls 
deeply resented all the imitation of their tart. They struggled for the rest of 
their lives to keep their recipe a secret. They never published it or even 
wrote it down, so an &quot;authentic recipe&quot; does not exist, only hundreds 
of different interpretations by other cooks.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Timbale</b></p> 
<p> Defining the term &quot;timbale&quot; is a complicated exercise in 
culinary context. Ingredients, method, purpose, and presentation are period and 
place dependent. In the most basic sense, timbales are fancy molded 
compositions combining an outer layer of starch (grain, pasta, rice) with 
fillings (meat, vegetable, fruit). Some are layered (similar to contemporary 
lasagne); others are vertical presentations (similar to vol-au-vent). Timbales 
can be savory or sweet and served at almost any course. The ultimate flexible 
food application.</p> 
<p> &quot;Timbale. By definition this word (which comes from Arab <i>thabal</i>
 meaning drum) means a small metal receptacle, round in shape and mostly 
intended to hold a beverage. Timbales of this kind are chiefly made of silver, 
sometimes of gold, or sometimes of silver plate, and are of many kinds. Some 
are simple; others are ornamented. The word timbale, which in the early days 
was only applied to individual drinking cups, has taken on a much wider 
meaning, and is used to describe all sorts of bowls, of metal, earthenware and 
china, lagrer than those that our fathers used at table, which were of a size 
to serve two guests together ...These timbales of the new type were used 
chiefly to serve vegetables and food in sauce. In French culinary parlance 
today the same word is still used in the phrase dresser en timbale to describe 
the serving of some preparation in a large bowl, which may be a vegetable dish 
or leguimier, although used for many other foodstuffs than vegetables. Thus in 
these timbales-legumiers are served scrambled eggs, food in sauce, purees, 
custards and othe prepartions, all to some extent liquid. Dresser en timbale in 
modern culinary parlance often means to heap the food on a platter in a pyramid 
shape, usually garnished. Culinarily the word timbale means a preparation of an 
kind cooked or served in a pie crust. Timbales of this kind are simply a sort 
of hot pie, which instead of being made in a special mould or dish, usualy 
inged, are made in plain round mould with high sides. These moulds are 
sometimes embellished...their sides are either goffered or decorated with 
motifs or [sic] different kinds. These timbales are filled before cooking with 
forcemeat and meats of various sorts...Ther eare many...kinds of timbale which 
are not filled until after the crust has been cooked...To meet the needs of the 
ordinary housewife, timbale cases are made in fireproof porcelain in the same 
shape and colour as the real pie-crusts. But the true gourmand, is not 
satisfied with a timbale whose crust is not edible; when served with a real 
timbale, this gourmand enjoys not only the contents but the container too.&quot;

<p> &quot;Timballo. Timbale. A dish, often with pasta or rice, made in a form 
and unmolded. Timballini are small molds. From the Arabic at-tabl (the drum). 
The most famous timballo is the Sicilian timballo di anellini, made with 
ring-shape dried pasta, balsamello, ground beef and chicken, peas, and 
vegetables, all wrapped in lettuce leaves and baked in a mold. Timballo di 
crespelle is crepes layered with spinach, ground meat, giblets, mozzarella, and

<p> &quot;There are homemade dishes, but for holidays and other festive

oven-baked macaroni, for which the pasta is combined with buffalo cheese, 
sausage and meat balls into a sort of pie. This is a festive dish in all three 
of the southern-most provinces, sometimes under the alternative name of 
timballo di maccheroni.&quot;---<i>ibid</i> (p. 554) </p>

Mary Taylor Simeti [Ecco Press:Hopwell NJ]1998 (p. 72)</p> 
<p> &quot;...Lampedusa's timballo is perhaps the summa of an ancient tradition 
rather than the product of a single recipe. It is curiously reminiscent of the 
patina apiciana from classical Rome, in which layers of laganum, an early 
version of lasagna, alternate with layers of chicken, fish, or songbirds. The 
sugar and the cinnamon recall the timbales and the torta described in 
fourteenth-century Tuscan cookbooks; the ham and truffles sound a note of 
nineteenth-century France. Its presence on a princely table in the middle of 
the nineteenth century, albeit as a provincial alternative to consomme, speaks 
volumes about the evolution of the Sicilian 'baronial cuisine'.&quot;<br>

<p> <b>Vinegar pie</b><br>
 From pioneer times through WWII, vinegar was a 
handy substitute for lemons. Why? It was inexpensive, domestically made &amp; 
easily transported. It provided the tangy zing our fore-mothers hoped to 
replicate in their baked goods. Most notably pies.</p> 
<p> &quot;Vinegar pie. A spiced pie made with vinegar, common in the North and 
Midwest since the nineteeth century. In America Eats, written in the 1930s for 
the WPA Illinois Writers Project but not published until 1992, Nelson Algren 
noted that as winter wore on midwestern setters' systems craved fruit and tart 
flavors: To satisfy their craving, ingenious housewives invented the vinegar 
pie...When baked in a pie tin, the resulting product was much relished and 
remained a favorite springtime dessert until young orchards coming into bearing 
provided real fruit pies to take its place.'&quot;<br>

prairie cooks when the nearest lemon was &quot;fifty miles away by oxcart.&quot;

<p> <b>Vinegar pie crust?</b><br>
 While food historians confirm Vinegar Pie 
originated in the American midwest, they are curiously silent about Vinegar Pie 
Crust. It is possible the two are connected. Crisco is sometimes cited as an 
ingredient. We do not, however, find the recipe in Crisco's cooking brochures. 
It is unlikely this was a &quot;corporate kitchen&quot; product.</p> 
<p> The earliest print reference we find in an American newspaper was 
published in 1968:</p> 
<blockquote> <b>&quot;Vinegar Pastry</b> <br>
 4 cups sifted flour <br>
 1 
tbsp. sugar<br>
 1 1/2 tsp. salt <br>
 1 1/2 cups lard or solid shortening <br>

 1 egg, well beaten<br>
 1 tbsp. vinegar <br>
 1/2 cup cold water <br>
 Blend 
flour, sugar and salt. Cut in lard until particles are the size of small peas. 
Combine egg, vinegar and water. Sprinkle over flour mixture, a tablespoonful at 
a time, mixing in with a fork. Form dough into a ball, divide and roll out as 
usual. Makes two 9-in. crust pies and a pie shell or five 9-in. pie 
shells.&quot;<br>

White,<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, February 15, 1968 (p. F20) </blockquote> A 
MIDWEST CONNECTION:
<p> &quot;Visitors to the Truman Library in Independence, Mo., often follow 
the path the Trumans themselves took once when Mrs. Lyndon Johnson came to 
visit them. They dine out at Stephenson's Apple Farm Restaurant, a sprawling, 
countrified place just over the Kansas City line...Stephenson's recipes are in 
great demand. Here are three that have been published...Egg 'N Vinegar Pie 
Crust Pastry.&quot;<br>
