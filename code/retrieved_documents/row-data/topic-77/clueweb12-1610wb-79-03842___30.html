<h3> Found Friday: Halloween! </h3>  Labels: easy, found friday, holiday <br>

<p> Halloween is my favorite holiday. I&rsquo;m not kidding. Why?</p> 
<p>Pumpkins. Sugar. Costumes. and&hellip;</p> 
<p>Pretty much every rule goes out the window. Especially my rules about 
jello, store bought cookies, and candy that doesn&rsquo;t contain chocolate.</p>
<p>(just for one night.)</p> 
<p>I wish I had another Halloween party to go to because last night I got to 
tastethese jello worms, and they were so awesome (thanks Karla!). I immediately 
wanted to make some.</p> 
<p>I also ran into these edible eyeballs.</p> 
<p>I think my husband would love me even more if I made Rachel&rsquo;s candy 
corn pumpkins.</p> 
<p>And I want to make these bat cookies, &lsquo;cause they look super easy and 
aren&rsquo;t just the decorated sugar cookie. That&rsquo;s what I usually do.
</p> 
<p>Happy Halloween. Hope you break a few rules, just for one night. </p>

<h3> New Foods: Quinoa </h3>  Labels: cake, dessert, gluten free, grains, new 
foods <br>

<p>New foods don&rsquo;t only happen to kids. I have a ton of quinoa in my 
cupboard. Why?</p> 
<p>Um, I saw it at Costco. </p> 
<p>(did you read that post where I said I was ashamed of myself for being such 
a corporate-struck foodie? Yesterday I was saying to myself, &ldquo;FORGET 
BUYING LOCAL! Just give me a drive-thru supermarket!&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t one 
of my better moments after shopping with kids for 2 hours.)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d heard about quinoa, so I bought it, thinking, &ldquo;This is so 
healthy. I will totally love this.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Are you laughing yet?</p> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s so&hellip; Crunchy. I like crunchy, yes, 
but it&rsquo;s too crunchy. Even when I tried to cook it longer. With more 
water. And more. And more. It just tastes uncooked to me.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been ignoring it for weeks now (months?). I felt embarrassed 
when I was going through my cupboard and saw it was still there. Can&rsquo;t it 
take a hint?</p> 
<p> I finally decided to give it a go when I saw a recipe for a quinoa cake. I 
liked it. (plus gluten free!) I really would have never known it was quinoa. 
Fudgy and moist.</p> 
<p>My mom told me that my dad likes it mixed with the regular rice in the rice 
cooker. I was skeptical but finally gave it a go.</p> 
<p>I LOVED quinoa in the rice cooker. I put a ratio of 1 rice cup (if you have 
a rice cooker, I hope you didn&rsquo;t throw this away) quinoa and 3 rice cups 
rice (duh) and filled the water up to &ldquo;rice&rdquo; line 4. The quinoa 
wasn&rsquo;t overwhelming, and it was fluffy with just the right texture.</p> 
<p>So I think I might venture even further and try this parfait. </p> 
<p>Do you like quinoa? Send some recipes my way so I can like it too. </p> <br>

<h3> Being Local, Eating Local </h3>  Labels: eating green, PFB 2010, recipes, 
tips <br>

<p>Everyone in my family was born here, in Hawaii, except me. That means that 
they are all &ldquo;local&rdquo;, as we say in the islands. My daughter, Amaya, 
has tons of local attitude. She has a shoe-optional wardrobe. Her hair is wild 
and sun-bleached. Her favorite food is SPAM musubi. She practically lives 
outside (with lots and lots of sunscreen on) and she loves to eat outside. 
Amaya talks about picnics non-stop. Usually our picnics are out in the yard. 
Every day she starts trying to pack her bento boxes with food she can grab out 
of the cupboard and fridge and announces that we&rsquo;re going on a picnic. 
Sometimes she will get ready for it even before we&rsquo;re awake. The second 
I&rsquo;m up she&rsquo;s asking me about a picnic. Sometimes when I wake up I 
find her outside on the porch in her pajamas, eating her picnic already. I was 
happy to be able to accommodate her love of picnics forthis Project Foodbuzz 
challenge. She knows food tastes better outside. Everyone&rsquo;s more relaxed 
and focused on enjoying the meal instead of rushing off to finish the next 
thing on our to-do list.When I think of food as being local, it is Hawaii born 
and bred. Just like local people, local produce and goods thrive in tropical 
weather and represent diverse Polynesian, Asian, and American flavors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food is expensive here, since we live on an island in the middle of the 
ocean. We tend to turn to cheap name brands because growing and producing here 
can be tougher. But we&rsquo;re trying. The farmers markets are growing 
rapidly. I&rsquo;ve seenmore markets pop up close to my home, and the one I 
frequent has grown in size. They&rsquo;ve become crowded and there are 
loyalties that run deep.Local eggs that go for $7 a dozen have plenty of buyers
. This tells me so much about how people have the power to change the way 
business is run.</p> 
<p>I have recently decided to do more to eat organic, free-range, and local. 
</p> 
<p>Of course, like I said, these things aren&rsquo;t always cheap, and a bit 
more time consuming and inconvenient. There&rsquo;s reality. Sometimes you have 
to rely on the world market when you want to pick up some Gruyere cheese. 
Sometimes your daughter wants to eat at Taco Bell even if you kind of hate 
yourself later. You do what you can and you make it work for your situation.</p>
<p>I made a picnic lunch that features local produce and goods, while trying 
to reflect local tastes and recipes. I&rsquo;ve highlighted the local 
ingredients I used in my menu. All the food I brought could be eaten cold or at 
room temperature and was a spin on the traditional sandwich type picnic lunch. 
I packed everything in glass boxes with lids (which stack very nicely and 
securely), and the soft stuff I put on top. I brought a small cutting board 
with small paring knife so we could assemble our sandwiches, and we used the 
lids to eat on to eliminate waste.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;ve got kids to carry 
and blankets and a little way to walk, bringing the china is too much to ask. I 
also think this minimizes the mess. Packing up dirty plates afterwards is 
trickier. Planning a menu to eat with your hands is much more simple and your 
shared experience is greater when you all have to drink your juice out of the 
glass jar that you brought. I like elaborate meals, but a simple picnic should 
be just that. Good food without a lot of clutter. Too many dishes and stuff to 
set out ruin the experience you&rsquo;re having with the outdoors. The meal is 
not center stage. It&rsquo;s just part of the picture.</p> 
<p><strong>Local Lunch</strong> (click on the links to print)</p> 
<p><strong>Kalua Pork Sandwiches</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>with organic 
pork, local sea salt, local cabbage/carrot slaw, and homemade barbecue sauce 
made with local lilikoi (passion fruit). Also topped with local avocado and 
tomato slices. The Kalua pork I made here mimics the flavor created in a 
traditional Hawaiian imu&mdash;underground oven. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sweet Potato Chips</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong> made with 
locally grown Okinawan sweet potatoes. Sweet potato is a traditional side dish 
at a luau. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>POG or Passion Orange Guava Juice</strong> made with Ka&rsquo;u 
Gold local oranges and foraged lilikoi and guava juices. POG is a style of 
juice popular in Hawaii and elsewhere. The stuff you buy at the store is 
practically viscous. </p> 
<p><strong>Mochi wrapped Chocolate dipped Strawberries </strong>featuring 
local Waialua milk chocolate and Maui grown strawberries. Mochi is a popular 
dessert among locals, since food in Hawaii has strong Japanese influence. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>We ate our lunch at Ho&rsquo;omaluhia, a botanical garden, and soaked up 
the local beauty.  Amaya &ldquo;fished&rdquo; in the lake with her stick, just 
like all kids have done since the beginning of who knows when. We ate and Amaya 
explored and we even picked some fruit along the path.</p> 
<p> Even though I&rsquo;m not local, getting in with the locals sure has its 
benefits.</p> <br>

<h3> Found Friday: Oatmeal </h3>  Labels: breakfast, easy, recipe, tips <br>

<p>Recently I found out you could make oatmeal in the rice cooker. STEEL CUT 
OATS!</p> 
<p> Steel cut oats are like the mother of all oatmeals. I love them, but I 
almost never make them because they&rsquo;re a total hassle.</p> 
<p>All you need is a porridge setting. I&rsquo;m not sure how many times 
I&rsquo;ve recommended the Zojirushi to people but it&rsquo;s really the best.
</p> 
<p>The night before, just use your rice cup to measure the steel cut oats and 
put water up to the same number of cups on the porridge line in your bowl. Hit 
porridge setting. Impatiently wait until breakfast. Or just sleep because you 
don&rsquo;t get excited about this like I do.</p> 
<p>They came out creamy and perfect. Like magic. I left the rice cooker on 
warm for four days until we finished off the bowl.</p> 
<p> My daughter could eat oatmeal every day, so I&rsquo;m trying to find new 
ways to cook it. Here are some ideas I&rsquo;m going to try:</p> 
<p>Bruleed Oatmeal</p> 
<p>pan fried oatmeal</p> 
<p>Chocolate pumpkin oatmeal</p> 
<p>How do you like your oatmeal?</p> <br>

<h3> A Little Foodie Manifesto </h3>  Labels: eating green, question <br>

<p>I read about the Spaghetti Taco craze thanks to iCarly on the NY Times 
website. </p> 
<p>I saw Jamie Oliver fail miserably to convince kids that chicken nuggets are 
nasty.</p> <br>

<p>Then I watched Food Inc. on Netflix. </p> 
<p><em>Then</em> I started thinking about the way I eat. And how the ideal 
meets the real. Because, hey, I have chicken nuggets in the fridge. And a bunch 
of meat that has been corn fed. And a bunch of pesticide sprayed vegetables 
next to the farmer&rsquo;s market corn. And well, corn isn&rsquo;t very good 
for you either.</p> 
<p>I thought a lot about the food I eat. About the food I feed my daughter. 
About the food I<em>let</em> my daughter eat. </p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of overwhelming. Escaping the corporation that is food 
today is an extra step, make that several extra steps, when you&rsquo;re 
considering your family, your job, and your budget.</p> 
<p>Maybe I can&rsquo;t fix everything. I have to admit that Jake and Amaya 
like fake cheese on their nachos better than real cheese. But there is a little 
I can do.</p> 
<p>I will buy grass fed beef and free range chicken. I will eat less meat but 
better quality.</p> 
<p>I will avoid fast food like the plague, even if vanilla soft serve is 
delicious.</p> 
<p>I will cook from scratch often. Every day. </p> 
<p>I will eat leftovers rather than instant. </p> 
<p>I think I can balance my life and still commit to these things. </p> 
<p>Do you think about these things? Food and economy and environment? </p> 
<p>What do you do to put it all in perspective?</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> The Bap&rsquo;za </h3>  Labels: entre, PFB 2010, recipe, vegetables <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; Amaya yells when she walks in the door. </p> 
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I pause, mid-click in my bibimbap pizza photo shoot. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I want to try your &lsquo;best pizza ever&rsquo;,&rdquo; she tells 
me and immediately starts reaching for a slice of meat.</p> 
<p>-------------------</p> 
<p>I guess I&rsquo;d been talking about it a bit too much. When I started 
looking ahead toChallenge #5 of Foodbuzz&rsquo;s Project Food Blog, I 
immediately started thinking pizza. Pizza is something I dream about. 
It&rsquo;s like the culinary canvas.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve had pizza in every country I&rsquo;ve ever visited, and everyone 
makes it their own. That&rsquo;s how versatile it is. Don&rsquo;t get me 
wrong&mdash;I love a perfect Neapolitan slice. But, me, I can&rsquo;t leave 
well enough alone. I make pizza often, and I usually subject everyone to my 
experimentation.</p> 
<p>When our friends came over for dinner last week, one said, &ldquo;Yep, this 
is Mariko pizza.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The combinations that I&rsquo;ve come up with will last me several good 
posts into the future. But one idea was my favorite. The one I kept calling the 
&ldquo;best pizza ever.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Amaya picked up on my vibe very quickly. She knows when I&rsquo;m on the 
trail for food. I buy my ingredients, make notes in my book, bounce wacky ideas 
off Jake, and announce my food-making schedule.</p> 
<p>When she got out the kid&rsquo;s set for our &ldquo;afternoon tea&rdquo;, 
she handed me a slice of wooden bread. Animatedly, she offered, &ldquo;Here you 
go. This is spicy corn on bread!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I made a face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I want spicy corn on bread. 
That sounds nasty.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<em>Try </em>it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to 
<em>love </em>it!&rdquo; </p> 
<p>Hmmm. Is that really how I sound? </p> 
<p>If kids are a pretty honest reflection of yourself, then my interest in 
food is definitely rubbing off on Amaya. As picky as she is, she gets that 
there is a world of taste out there, and she wants it. She gets that meals 
don&rsquo;t have to be static repetitions of weeknight canned casseroles and 
eating out is a chance to try something new without having to do the dishes. 
She gets that being excited about food is an extension of the pleasure of taste.
</p> 
<p>And she definitely gets that I am going to make her try my pizza. She 
doesn&rsquo;t get out of trying anything when it comes to the dinner table.</p> 
<p>------------------</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I <em>love</em> your &lsquo;best pizza ever&rsquo;, Mom,&rdquo; she 
says, as she picks through the toppings she wants, and leaves the rest behind. 
</p> 
<p><strong>The Bap&rsquo;za</strong></p> 
<p><em>This pizza is a recreation of bibimbap in pizza form. Bibimbap is a 
Korean dish of vegetables and meat on rice which is tossed and mixed with hot 
bean paste and a barely fried egg. It is a mix of flavors that work, however 
odd it sounds. The snap of vegetables, sweet sesame, spicy gochujang, salty 
meat, sour pickles, and soft rice each offer their individual and distinct 
treasures to your tongue and teeth. I am a huge fan of (read: obsessed with) 
stone bowl bap. In a stone bowl that has been heated, the flavors kind of cook 
together and sizzle while the rice becomes crisp on the edges. The rice crust I 
made on a pizza pan imitated that perfectly. The pizza sauce is a sweetened 
gochujang (hot bean paste) that mimics Korean fried chicken sauce recipes 
I&rsquo;ve had. It brought the pizza together well. I stuck with common bap 
toppings and made my own namul (seasoned vegetables) to go with the bulgogi 
beef, egg, mushrooms, and cucumber. Baking the egg in the oven on the rice 
crust and sauce made it just right, as the yolk was hot and still able to mix 
well with my toppings as I loaded them on. The pizza sliced nicely and held 
together, but with all the toppings, you&rsquo;ll want to eat this one with a 
fork, because you are likely more civilized than me. I still ate it with my 
hands and made the crust into a tool to wrap up the toppings, just like folding 
a New York slice.</em></p>

<h3> Round 4 Voting is OPEN! </h3>  Labels: PFB 2010 <br>

<p>I have to tell you, it&rsquo;s been nice getting comments for once. So if 
nothing else, this project food blog thing ROCKS because I feel like I&rsquo;ve 
been let into a secret society of &ldquo;people who look at blogs.&rdquo; I 
have a feeling that this is a very big society, actually. Ha ha.</p> 
<p>So Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, for your nice, kind, and loving words, 
despite my amateur-hour pictures and too-long posts. Hopefully I will see some 
of you around here again.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve also <em>loved </em>being exposed to some new food blogs. Ahem. 
I do not want to tell you how long my reading list is now. Too long. Like, way 
too long. But it&rsquo;s worth it, because now I just want to lick my screen 
all day.</p> 
<p>But let&rsquo;s get that image out of our heads. If you want to vote for 
me, you can do so here. No pressure, though. I know asking for votes is kind of 
rude of me. I mean, you&rsquo;re here, reading my extremely long posts and 
looking at my terrible food pictures and NOW I&rsquo;m asking you to vote for 
me?</p> 
<p>Sheesh. Can I mention me again? Me Me Me. </p> 
<p>Love you guys. Really. </p>

<h3> Processed Fruit </h3>  Labels: dessert, fruit, recipe <br>

<p>&nbsp; Hawaii has a lot of secrets&mdash;spaces among the valleys and 
trails that are meaningful to people who live there. Luckily there are enough 
secrets to go around, at least until the next guide book is published.</p> 
<p>We have a few places we go regularly for foraging. There are seasons for 
fruit, in Hawaii, despite being an average 80 degrees most of the year. 
Currently we are in a mountain apple season. During this season we make plans 
to visit the mountain valleys that have the best trees and we pay attention to 
the groves of trees that are getting ripe so we can come back. We come back 
with bags of fruit and the fruit flies love it as much as we do.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe mountain apple to those people who&rsquo;ve 
never had it (which is most people, really. Even people who live in Hawaii may 
not ever see it). It is like the softest, ripest pear, in texture, without any 
of the grit, but the flavor is slightly rosy and slightly sour. It has 
wonderful chew that seems to melt and feel chunky at the same time. It has a 
lot of juice but has a dry skin. It has a small pit in the center. The skin is 
not even skin at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a red extension of the flesh. There 
is an edge of bitterness. The whole fruit is like a fleeting moment.</p> 
<p> And it&rsquo;s absolutely nothing like an apple. (although it makes a 
wonderful pie, if you pick more than you can eat raw, since it lasts for about 
2 days off the tree.)</p> 
<p>My husband, Jake, is a fruit hunter. I think this could be a great reality 
show on the Discovery channel.</p> 
<p>Vicious animals guarding the trails. </p> 
<p>Dangerous river crossings Remnants from the last civilization </p> 
<p>And hotties like this: </p> 
<p>Mozely was so excited that he opened his eyes for all of 30 seconds on our 
2 hour hike.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Amaya has been Jake&rsquo;s apprentice for a while now, and she spots fruit 
and calls out from her perch. Jake hands her fruit and she devours it. She will 
eat as much guava and strawberry guava as you can find. They hike a few times a 
week and we always have passionfruit (lilikoi), guava, strawberry guava 
(waiwi), or mountain apples around the house. Sometimes we can even stock up on 
local avocados (which, I&rsquo;m telling you, have so many varieties and 
flavors that Haas avocados will hold no interest for you ever again). </p> 
<p>Fruit is an instant, beautiful taste, and probably whatever you do to it 
will make it worse than if you had just eaten it off the tree. So if I make 
something from it, it better be dang good.</p> 
<p>Mainland fruits, like blueberries, are expensive here. If I wanted to make 
a traditional fruit tart, it&rsquo;s likely that I&rsquo;d be spending about 
$20 just on the topping. I decided to forage for our ingredients and make 
ourselves an island fruit tart.</p> 
<p> For this challenge (#4&mdash;Can you believe I&rsquo;ve made it this far?) 
forFoodbuzz&rsquo;s Project Food Blog, we were challenged to photograph our 
process, whether this was for a cooking method, or recipe. Our process starts 
out with the fruit. Foraging for your own fruit changes the whole game and 
makes you feel a little more connected with your food. Everything tastes better 
when you&rsquo;re hiking.</p> 
<p><strong>Island Fresh Fruit Tart </strong>(printable version will follow in 
the next post)</p> 
<p>For the hike</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hiking snacks, a large pole with a net attached, good eyes </li> </ul> 
<p>For the topping</p> 
<ul> 
<li>4 large handfuls of guava </li> 
<li>as much passionfruit as you can find </li> 
<li>6-8 mountain apple (if you can restrain yourself from eating this many) 
</li> 
<li>1 mango, if you&rsquo;re lucky, as your tree has already been stripped 
</li> </ul> 
<p>For the pastry cream:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 C cream </li> 
<li>1 C milk </li> 
<li>pinch salt </li> 
<li>5 egg yolks </li> 
<li>1/2 C sugar </li> 
<li>3 T cornstarch </li> 
<li>4 T cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces </li> 
<li>1 C guava puree </li> </ul> 
<p>For the crust:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>4 T unsweetened grated coconut </li> 
<li>5 T sugar </li> 
<li>5 graham cracker sheets </li> 
<li>3 T melted butter </li> </ul> 
<p>For the lilikoi glaze</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 C lilikoi (passionfruit) puree </li> 
<li>1/2 C sugar </li> </ul> 
<p>Method:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>For the hike: Pass the cow,  the no-parking sign,  and the WWII bunker.  
Stop and enjoy the fruits along the way. Swim, if you can (swimsuit 
optional),&nbsp; and eat your snacks. Get dirty and sweaty and hungry. Pick all 
the fruit you can find. </li> 
<li>Create your purees. Cut off tops of guava  and puree in the blender with a 
little bit of water. Don&rsquo;t blend it TOO much, because you don&rsquo;t 
want the seeds to be so miniscule that you won&rsquo;t be able to strain it 
out. Strain it out with a large hole wire mesh sieve. </li> 
<li>Cut open your passionfruit, scoop the pulp into the blender, add a little 
water, and blend for a few seconds, again, don&rsquo;t puree the seeds. Strain 
with a fine-holed wire mesh strainer. Constantly scrape the bottom of the 
strainer with a spoon and stir so the seeds will be moved around and the juice 
can get through. </li> 
<li>Make the pastry cream:  Heat the cream and milk on medium heat (with a 
pinch of salt) in a heavy bottomed sauce pan. Add half the sugar. Stir 
occasionally and monitor to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t burn.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Whisk the egg yolks for about 15 seconds. Add the rest of the sugar.  
Whisk about 15 more seconds. Add the cornstarch. Whisk again until the mixture 
has turned light yellow and seems a bit thicker (until the sugar is dissolved, 
about 30 seconds).</li> 
<li>When the cream is simmering, add it in a thin, steady stream to the egg 
yolks while whisking constantly. Whisk until combined, then put back into the 
saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat. Add 3/4 C guava puree 
and bring to a simmer, almost boil, for a few minutes, until it is thickened. 
Remove to a bowl and set to cool. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of 
the pastry cream and put in the fridge for at least 3 hours to cool completely.
</li> 
<li>Make your crust: While the pastry cream is cooling, turn the oven to 325 
degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put your coconut flakes in a glass pie pan and put 
it in the oven for 9 minutes, stirring occasionally until the flakes are 
slightly toasted.</li> 
<li>Throw the graham crackers, coconut flakes, and sugar into the food 
processor and blend until the crackers are fine bits.</li> 
<li>Remove the cracker mixture to a bowl and add the melted butter. Stir with 
a fork until combined.Press the crust into a tart pan with the bottom of a 
heavy metal measuring cup. </li> 
<li>Bake for 20 minutes until the crust is dark and fragrant. Let cool 
completely on a wire rack.</li> 
<li>Lilikoi glaze: put the lilikoi puree and sugar into a small heavy saucepan.
 Simmer over medium high heat, stirring constantly, for about 7 minutes, or 
until thickened.</li> 
<li>Assemble: Cut mango, mountain apple, and guava into thin slices.  Pour the 
now cooled pastry cream into the crust, smoothing out to the sides. Spread all 
but 3 T of the glaze on top of the cream. Place fruit slices over this, in some 
sort of pattern. Brush the remaining glaze on the fruit. Serve. </li> 
<li>Wash the dishes, because you used every single one in the house. &nbsp;
