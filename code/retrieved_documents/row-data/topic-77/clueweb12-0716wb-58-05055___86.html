<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>Healthy food, in appropriate amounts, provides children and youth with the 
nutrients and energy needed daily for growth and development, as well as the 
foundation for lifelong good health.</p> 
<p>Yet we know that many children and youth are not well nourished:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Many are eating too many &ldquo;junk&rdquo; and processed foods and too 
few healthy foods like vegetables and fruits, milk and whole grains</li> 
<li> Children and youth who are hungry or poorly nourished are more irritable, 
lethargic and easily distracted</li> 
<li> Rates of overweight and obese children and youth in Canada are at an 
all-time high</li> 
<li> Aboriginal children and youth are experiencing overweight and obesity 
rates two to three times greater than the already high rates found in the 
general population</li> </ul> 
<p>Licensed residential settings have the ability to make a positive impact on 
the children and youth in their care; children and youth who develop life 
skills and healthy eating habits now are more likely to eat nutritious foods 
throughout their lifetime, thus reducing the risk of obesity and diseases such 
as diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and certain types of cancer.</p> 
<p><strong>Use this tool kit as a supportive guide</strong></p> 
<p>The purpose of this tool kit is to support licensed residential service 
providers in meeting the nutritional needs of children and youth (aged 3 to 18) 
in their care. This tool kit will assist licensed residential service providers 
in meeting Ministry requirements and policies concerning food and nutrition.</p>
<p>This easy-to-use tool kit includes basic food and nutrition information, 
tips and suggestions, as well as links to more information. Nutrition basics 
are based on Health Canada&rsquo;s revised Food Guides:<em>Eating Well with 
Canada&rsquo;s Food Guide</em> (2007) and <em>Eating Well with Canada&rsquo;s 
Food Guide &ndash; First Nations, Inuit and M&eacute;tis</em> (2007).</p> 
<p> Residential care settings are diverse, and the needs of the children and 
youth within those settings can vary. Licensed residential settings already 
have a variety of good practices in place to foster healthy eating habits. Some 
ideas in this tool kit will not be appropriate for all children and youth. Use 
your own good judgment when applying this information, and always consult 
appropriate health professionals if you have questions.</p> 
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The tool kit does not address healthy eating for 
infants, toddlers, children and youth with food restrictions due to medical 
conditions and/or behavioural issues, children and youth who are tube fed or 
pregnant teenagers; these cases typically require very specific nutrition 
considerations. If you have nutrition questions regarding these client groups, 
contact your local public health department to speak with a registered 
dietitian, or talk to a doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>

<h2>Section One: Healthy Eating for Children and Youth</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> 
<p>Good nutrition is important for overall health, growth and development for 
all children and youth. It is important to provide children and youth in 
licensed residential settings with nutritious foods in appropriate amounts to 
support their mental, physical and emotional health and well-being.</p> 
<p>Children and youth who eat right and are active tend to: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Have a healthy body weight </li> 
<li> Feel good about themselves </li> 
<li> Have the energy to be active </li> 
<li> Have stronger muscles and bones </li> 
<li> Enjoy overall better health</li> </ul> 
<p>Children and youth who are hungry or poorly nourished (e.g., higher intakes 
of foods and beverages high in calories, fat, sugar or salt such as chips, 
donuts, soft drinks) may:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Be irritable, aggressive or moody </li> 
<li> Be uninterested in learning situations and do poorly at school </li> 
<li> Be unable to concentrate and focus on tasks </li> 
<li> Have less energy for daily activities</li> </ul> 
<p>Children and youth who form healthy eating habits will benefit from these 
essential life skills in years to come. They will be able to better manage 
daily living, and will reduce their risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes, 
heart disease, osteoporosis and certain cancers.</p> 
<p>In this section you will find:</p>

<h3>Healthy eating basics</h3> 
<p>The best way to eat well is by following <em>Eating Well with 
Canada&rsquo;s Food Guide</em> (2007) and <em>Eating Well with Canada&rsquo;s 
Food Guide &ndash; First Nations, Inuit and M&eacute;tis</em>(2007) (hereafter 
referred to as Canada&rsquo;s food guide). TheFood Guides&rsquo; 
recommendations are designed to help give children and youth the energy and 
nutrients they need to grow, develop and thrive.</p> 
<p>The Food Guides provide recommendations for how much and what types of food 
children and youth should eat every day from each of the four Food Groups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Vegetables and Fruit </li> 
<li> Grain Products </li> 
<li> Milk and Alternatives </li> 
<li> Meat and Alternatives</li> </ul> 
<p>The Food Guides are simple tools that can help licensed residential 
settings make sure that children and youth are getting the right types of foods 
in the appropriate amounts. Remember, what is most important is their eating 
habits over time.</p> 
<p>The Food Guide website is an excellent resource, covering everything from 
serving sizes and healthier choices to meal and snack suggestions.</p> 
<p>Explore the Food Guides, order additional copies, and help children and 
youth create their own personal Food Guideonline. Copies are also available 
from local public health units and community health centres.</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Healthy eating does make a difference! </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 70% of children do not eat the recommended five servings of vegetables 
and fruit*. Children and youth who don&rsquo;t eat five servings of vegetables 
and fruit are more likely to be overweight, increasing their risk for chronic 
diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease.</li> 
<li> Risks of cancer from a poor diet are the same as from smoking. </li> 
<li> Over 1/3 of children don&rsquo;t eat the recommended two servings of milk 
and alternatives*. These children are less likely to be getting the calcium 
they need to develop strong, healthy bones.</li> 
<li> Whole grains (e.g., brown rice, oatmeal, whole grain breads) have 80% 
more disease-fighting compounds than refined grains (e.g., white bread). 
That&rsquo;s why the Food Guide recommends that at least half of our grain 
product choices be whole-grain.</li> </ul>

<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Healthy food choices</h3> 
<p>Most of the food served should be healthy choices from each food group with 
minimal processing. The following charts offer guidance on what foods to serve 
more and less often. The &ldquo;healthy foods to serve every day&rdquo; contain 
less fat, salt (sodium) and sugar and provide more vitamins, minerals and fibre.
</p> 
<p>Remember to use food labels to compare brands to make healthier choices. 
See &ldquo;Section Six: Budgetwise Shopping&rdquo; for more on reading labels.
</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Teach children and youth how all foods can fit into a healthy diet.
</strong></p> 
<p>Help children and youth understand that healthier choices give them energy 
to play, grow and learn, but also that all foods can be eaten and enjoyed 
&ndash; even treats. Avoid referring to foods as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Food should always be approached in a positive way. Calling 
a food &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or &ldquo;fattening&rdquo; can cause a child or youth 
to feel guilt or shame. Find out more:Foods to limit.</p> Healthy Foods to

<h3>How much food do children and youth need?</h3> 
<p>The Food Guides recommend how much food children and youth should consume 
every day for healthy growth and achieving or maintaining a healthy weight, 
includingserving sizes of various foods within each Food Group. Remember:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Children and youth can eat more than one serving from each Food Group at 
each meal or snack. For example, a sandwich includes two servings of Grain 
Products (two slices of bread).</li> 
<li> One Food Guide serving can be split up over the course of a day. For 
example, a child might eat 1 tbsp of peanut butter in the morning and a 
soft-boiled egg at lunch (each is half a serving) to make one serving of Meat 
and Alternatives.</li> </ul> 
<p>Measuring specific servings is neither necessary nor practical. Use these 
visual cues to approximate serving sizes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A tennis ball is about &frac12; cup of food </li> 
<li> A hockey puck is &frac12; a bagel (one Grain Products serving) </li> 
<li>A deck of cards is a serving of meat, fish or poultry</li> 
<li> A golf ball is 2 tbsp (a serving of peanut butter) </li> 
<li> Two golf balls are 4 tbsp (a serving of nuts/seeds)</li> 
<li> Two thumbs are a serving of hard cheese </li> 
<li> A cupped hand is a serving of beans, lentils or breakfast cereal </li> 
<li> A fist is about 1 cup (a serving of lettuce-based salad)</li> </ul> 
<p>It is normal for appetites to vary from day to day and from one meal or 
snack to the next. Where appropriate, let children and youth determine how much 
to eat. This encourages them to listen to their body cues. A child&rsquo;s or 
youth&rsquo;s appetite will vary naturally depending on:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Growth and development stage (growth spurts) </li> 
<li> Gender and age (males need more calories) </li> 
<li> Time of day</li> 
<li> How active or tired he or she is</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some children and youth may eat more than they need 
for a variety of physical, social and psychological reasons. Also, some 
medications may reduce or enhance appetite. See &ldquo;Section Three: Special 
Nutrition Considerations&rdquo; for more information.</p> 
<p>Explore Canada&rsquo;s Food Guide&rsquo;s sample menus for children and 
youth to get an idea of how much food a child or youth might eat in a day. 
These menus are just guides; a child or youth may eat more or less depending on 
individual needs.</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Boosting fruit and vegetable intake!</strong></p> 
<p>The Food Guides recommend children eat 4 to 6 servings of vegetables and 
fruit each day and teens should eat 7 to 8 servings. Most children and youth 
readily eat enough fruit, but getting vegetable servings can be more difficult. 
Here are some tips:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When possible, serve as a role model by eating vegetables in their presence
</li> 
<li> Involve the children or youth in growing, shopping for and cooking 
vegetables (where appropriate)</li> 
<li> Serve a vegetable with each meal and snack </li> 
<li> Serve colourful vegetables with a dip (hummus, tzatziki, baba ghanouj) 
</li> 
<li> Puree cooked vegetables into sauces, dips and soups </li> 
<li> Add canned pumpkin, grated carrot or shredded zucchini to muffin recipes 
</li> 
<li> Serve cooked broccoli with a bit of cheese sauce </li> 
<li> Make sweet potato French fries/wedges </li> 
<li> Add canned diced tomatoes to tomato soup </li> 
<li> Add frozen or canned vegetables to canned soups </li> 
<li> Serve vegetable juice &ndash; warm or cold (look for lower-sodium brands) 
</li> 
<li> Load up pizzas, sandwiches and pasta sauces with vegetables</li> </ul>

<h3>Healthy meals, snacks and drinks</h3> 
<p>Meals and snacks should provide a variety of nutritious choices from the 
four Food Groups. Special dietary needs (e.g., allergies) and cultural and 
religious choices should also be considered.</p> 
<p>Follow these guidelines for healthy meals and snacks:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Breakfast &ndash; foods from at least three Food Groups </li> 
<li> Lunch and dinner &ndash; foods from four Food Groups </li> 
<li> Snacks &ndash; foods from at least two Food Groups</li> </ul> 
<p>Meals and snacks should be served at regular times (as much as possible) 
each day. Serve three meals and two or three snacks no longer than two to three 
hours apart for preschoolers and three to four hours apart for older children 
and youth.</p> 
<p>For more information on healthy meals and snacks, see &ldquo;Section Five: 
Menu Planning &ndash; The Basics.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>The importance of breakfast</h3> 
<p>A healthy breakfast should be eaten every day. Children who eat breakfast 
generally have a higher<br>
 intake of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients 
that can help fuel active learning and play. Research<br>
 also shows that 
children who eat breakfast:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Are able to concentrate better in class</li> 
<li> Are absent from school less often </li> 
<li>Have fewer behavioural issues at school </li> 
<li> Tend to have healthier diets overall </li> 
<li>Are less likely to be overweight</li> </ul> 
<p>For more information on healthy breakfast ideas, see &ldquo;Section Five: 
Menu Planning &ndash; The Basics.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Healthy snacking</strong></p> 
<p>Children and youth may need two or three healthy snacks that pack a 
nutritional punch rather than filling them up with &ldquo;empty 
calories.&rdquo; Snacks should:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Satisfy hunger between meals (smaller stomachs and growth spurts require 
more frequent eating)</li> 
<li> Provide energy and nutrients to fuel activity, growth and development 
</li> 
<li> Include Food Group selections that are missed at mealtimes, such as 
vegetables and fruit, and milk and alternatives</li> </ul> 
<p>Children and youth who are overweight or obese still require snacks; make 
sure that they are nutritious Food Group choices and amounts are appropriate.
</p> 
<p>For more information on healthy snack ideas, see &ldquo;Section Five: Menu 
Planning &ndash; The Basics.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Limit soda pop.</strong></p> 
<p>Soda pop has no place in a child&rsquo;s diet, and it should be limited for 
youth. Here are the reasons why:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Just one can of caffeinated pop affects small children negatively 
(insomnia, headaches, irritability, nervousness)</li> 
<li> Research shows that a high intake of pop is associated with increased 
caloric intake and increased body weight</li> 
<li> Children and youth who drink pop are less likely to get enough calcium 
and vitamin D in their diets (because they drink less milk)</li> 
<li> High intake of pop is associated with increased cavities</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>What to drink</strong></p> 
<p> Sugary beverages like pop and fruit punch provide little more than sugar 
and should be limited. Most often, serve:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Water &ndash; the best choice for quenching thirst </li> 
<li> Milk or fortified soy beverages; Health Canada recommends 2 cups of milk 
every day for all Canadians to get enough vitamin D</li> 
<li> 100% fruit juice &ndash; &frac12; to 1 cup is enough for a day </li> 
<li> Vegetable juice &ndash; look for lower-sodium brands </li> </ul>

hydrated by visitingEatrightOntario.ca.</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Serve 100% juice, not &ldquo;drinks.&rdquo; </strong></p> 
<p>Only 100% unsweetened juice counts as a serving of vegetables and fruit. 
Fruit drinks may look like juice, but are mostly sugar and water with just a 
little, if any, real fruit juice. Most fruit drinks also have very few, if any, 
vitamins and minerals. Limit drinks made from crystals, and fruit drinks that 
have these words on the package:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> drink </li> 
<li> punch </li> 
<li> cocktail </li> 
<li> -ade </li> 
<li> beverage </li> </ul> 
<p>These fruit drinks do NOT count as a serving of vegetables and fruit.</p>

<h3>Fat in children&rsquo;s and youths&rsquo; diets</h3> 
<p>Fat in small amounts is actually an important part of a healthy diet 
because it can provide essential nutrients for growth and development. When it 
comes to fat:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> For young children, high-fat Food Group selections that are nutritious, 
such as hard cheeses and peanut and almond butters, should not be limited.</li> 
<li>For youth, more choices can be lower-fat, but not all need to be. Serve 
higher-fat Food Group foods less often or in smaller amounts, and balance them 
with lower-fat foods.</li> 
<li> Higher-fat treats and fast foods that provide few nutrients (e.g., chips, 
French fries, chocolate) should be limited for both age groups.</li> </ul> 
<p>Some fats are better than others. Health Canada recommends: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Eating a small amount (about 2-3 tbsp) of healthy fats each day, such as 
vegetable oils like canola, olive and soybean</li> 
<li>Limiting butter, hard margarine, lard and shortening </li> 
<li> Choosing soft margarines that are low in saturated and trans fats</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Avoid trans fat</strong></p> 
<p>Trans fat is an unhealthy type of fat linked to heart disease. There is no 
safe amount of trans fat. Avoid it as much as possible. It is found mostly in 
processed foods such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Hard margarine, shortening and vegetable ghee </li> 
<li> Baked goods, such as crackers, muffins, donuts, cookies, breads, cakes, 
pies and tortillas</li> 
<li> Packaged snacks, such as popcorn, granola bars with chocolate or creamy 
toppings, and hot chocolate</li> 
<li> Ready-to-eat and frozen foods, such as pizza pockets, waffles, toaster 
pastries, burritos, frozen meals and desserts</li> 
<li> &ldquo;Fast food,&rdquo; such as deep-fried fish sandwiches, French fries 
and chicken fingers</li> 
<li> Salad dressings and dips</li> 
<li> Packaged convenience foods, such as rice and pasta mixtures, taco shells, 
cake mixes, pie crusts, icing, instant noodles and pudding</li> </ul> 
<p>Trans fat also occurs naturally in small amounts in some meat (e.g., beef 
and lamb) and dairy, but it is not known to be as harmful as the processed type 
of trans fat.</p> 
<p><strong>Limiting trans fat</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Read the Nutrition Facts Table on packaged goods. Buy trans fat-free 
versions of foods as much as possible.</li> 
<li>Avoid baked goods and fried restaurant foods if there is any uncertainty 
regarding whether they are trans fat-free. Use healthier fats when baking and 
cooking.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids are one of the &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats to 
include in a healthy diet.</strong></p> 
<p>This type of fat is necessary for normal development of the brain, eyes and 
nerves. It is especially important for young children, whose brains are 
developing rapidly. Try to include sources of omega-3 fats regularly. The best 
sources are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fatty fish: canned salmon, herring and halibut. Call EatRight Ontario at 
1-877-510-510-2 to learn about choosinglow-mercury fish. </li> 
<li> Foods fortified with omega-3 fats, such as orange juice, milk and eggs
</li> </ul>

<h2>Section Two<br>
 Positive Mealtimes</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p> 
<p>Establishing a positive mealtime where children and youth feel safe and 
relaxed is critical to learning healthy eating habits &ndash; it is just as 
important as the food they eat. Handling common feeding challenges effectively 
can help to avoid conflicts over food, keep mealtimes pleasant and contribute 
to good eating habits.</p> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find:</strong></p>

<li> Feeding situations that may require medical advice </li> 
<li> Positive mealtime checklist </li> 
<li> Approaches to feeding different age groups</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Feeding situations that may require medical advice </h3> 
<p>At times, it can be difficult to distinguish between developmentally 
appropriate behaviour related to food and more complex issues. For example, the 
following would most often be considered developmentally appropriate, or 
typical, behaviour:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Eating very little one day and eating a lot the next day </li> 
<li>Refusing to eat vegetables or meat </li> 
<li>Only wanting &ldquo;junk&rdquo; food all the time </li> </ul> 
<p>The following list is not exhaustive but provides some examples of 
behaviour that may indicate the need to work with qualified professionals, the 
child or youth&rsquo;s case manager and/or the parents or guardians to identify 
any medical, medication-related or mental health issues and develop a plan for 
response:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hoarding/hiding extra food </li> 
<li>Refusing to eat at all or eating very little </li> 
<li>Eating without a sense of control &ndash; excessive overeating; demanding 
food between meals and snack times</li> 
<li> Being highly sensitive to certain tastes or textures </li> 
<li>Extremely picky eating (only eats a few foods) </li> 
<li>Signs of malnutrition and/or dehydration including weight loss, lethargy 
or poor concentration</li> 
<li> Possible signs of eating disorders, such as weight fluctuations, unusual 
eating habits and excessive concerns about weight issues</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Positive mealtime checklist </h3> 
<p>The ideas listed below may help make mealtimes positive, establish 
appropriate roles, resolve conflicts over food, and help children and youth 
feel safe and relaxed.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Serve food family-style (where appropriate).</strong> Let children 
and youth serve themselves so they are in control of what and how much they eat.
</li> 
<li><strong>Avoid controlling what or how much children and youth eat.</strong>
 Avoid bribing, rewarding, coaxing, guilting, punishing and any other form of 
pressure. Expecting children and youth to &ldquo;clean their plate&rdquo; can 
lead to overeating.</li> 
<li><strong>Make regular mealtimes a priority.</strong> Establish when and 
where food will be served. Serve three meals and two or three snacks at the 
same times each day, no longer than two to three hours apart for preschoolers 
and three to four hours apart for older children and youth.</li> 
<li><strong>Model good habits.</strong> Children and youth learn best from 
good examples.</li> 
<li><strong>Eat at the table with no TV, phones or toys.</strong> These 
distractions discourage socializing at mealtimes and make it harder for 
children and youth to focus on eating.</li> 
<li><strong>Keep mealtimes relaxed and upbeat.</strong> Children and youth who 
are anxious, upset or feeling unsafe will not eat well.</li> 
<li><strong>Serve new foods alongside familiar foods.</strong> This will help 
make introducing new foods easier on everyone.</li> 
<li><strong>Serve at least one well-liked food at mealtimes.</strong> Always 
have at least one food on the table that children and youth will likely eat, 
even if it is just bread or rice.</li> 
<li><strong>Involve children and youth (if possible).</strong> Children and 
youth who are involved in menu planning, grocery shopping, cooking and serving 
are more likely to eat and enjoy the meals.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Pressure AND praise about what and how much children and youth eat 
can lead to poor eating habits and future health problems.</strong></p> 
<p> In our efforts to encourage children and youth to eat well, we may 
actually be pressuring them to eat. Often, as a result, children and youth will 
eat less. Conversely, praising children and youth for eating everything on 
their plate may result in overeating as they try to earn approval &ndash; and 
that can lead to overweight.</p> 
<p>Avoid comments like these: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> &ldquo;Just take one more bite.&rdquo; </li> 
<li> &ldquo;No dessert until you eat your meat.&rdquo; </li> 
<li> &ldquo;No more bread until you eat some vegetables.&rdquo;</li> 
<li> &ldquo;Finish your milk. It&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo; </li> 
<li> &ldquo;How do you know you don&rsquo;t like it unless you try it?&rdquo;
</li> 
<li> &ldquo;Good boy! You ate all your peas.&rdquo; </li> 
<li> &ldquo;You are such a good eater. You ate everything on your plate!&rdquo;
</li> </ul> 
<p>Note: Reinforcing statements, food rules and routines for how, when and 
what to eat may be appropriate for some children with developmental disorders. 
For example, in some situations, using pictures or statements such as 
&ldquo;eat first, then play&rdquo; may help a child or youth with autism to 
understand routines.</p>

<h3>Approaches to feeding different age groups </h3> 
<p>Assuming that no specific issues or responses related to medications, 
medical conditions, special needs or mental health issues have been identified, 
the ideas provided here, if appropriate to a particular licensed residential 
setting, can help handle everyday situations in a positive way.</p> 
<p>Also see &ldquo;Section Three: Special Nutrition Considerations&rdquo; 
&ndash; Food and Behaviour.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviours and approaches </strong></p> 
<p>The following examples are provided to illustrate possible strategies for 
dealing with food challenges. Note that for some children and youth, including 
those with special needs and Autism Spectrum Disorders, these approaches may 
not be appropriate. Specific approaches for dealing with such cases should be 
discussed with a health care or rehabilitation professional.</p> 
<p><strong>Feeding children aged 3-5 </strong></p> 
<p>Young children should eat the same healthy foods as adults &ndash; just in 
smaller portions. Here are a few helpful tips:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Serve food in attractive ways.</strong> Most young children like 
foods presented in fun and interesting ways e.g., different colours, shapes and 
flavours.</li> 
<li> <strong>Offer finger foods and foods that can be served separately.
</strong> Mixed dishes may be less appealing to children at this age. </li> 
<li><strong> Serve soft-cooked or raw vegetables with dip as well as cooked 
vegetables.</strong></li> 
<li> <strong>Meats should be easy to chew.</strong> Try meats in sauces or cut 
into bite-sized pieces.</li> 
<li> <strong>Do not restrict nutritious, higher-fat foods, such as peanut 
butter, meat and cheese</strong> &ndash; children need more fat in their diets 
than adults do. Limit higher-fat, less-nutritious foods (e.g., chips, cookies, 
ice cream).</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Foods that are high-risk choking hazards for younger children (aged 
3-5)</strong></p> 
<p>Young children are especially vulnerable to choking on food. These foods 
pose a high risk of choking:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Whole hot dogs and grapes (make them safer: slice lengthwise and cut into 
bite-sized pieces)</li> 
<li> Raw hard vegetables (make them safer: soft-cook or shred into foods) </li>
<li> Peanut butter served from a spoon (make it safer: serve thinly spread on 
crackers, not moist bread)</li> 
<li> Fruit with seeds (make it safer: remove all seeds and pits and buy 
seedless watermelons, grapes, etc.)</li> 
<li> Popcorn, peanuts, nuts and hard candies &ndash; do not serve these to 
young children</li> 
<li> Soft breads, muffins or cakes (they can form a sticky ball)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child wants to eat the same food all the time.
</strong></p> 
<p> Approach: Let the child have his or her &ldquo;favourite food&rdquo; as 
long as it belongs to one of the four Food Groups. For example, plain pasta is 
a favourite of many preschoolers. Keep offering other healthy choices at each 
meal.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child eats very little or skips an entire meal. 
</strong></p> 
<p>Approach: During the preschool years, growth and consequently appetite may 
slow down. The odd skipped meal is not a concern as long as the child is 
growing normally. Serve small portions, provide snacks about two hours before 
mealtimes, and offer only water between meals and snacks since even juice or 
milk can spoil a child&rsquo;s appetite for the next meal or snack time.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child does not want to drink milk. </strong></p> 
<p>Approach: Offer a small amount (&frac12; cup) of milk, but don&rsquo;t 
force it. Preschoolers need 2 cups of milk or fortified soy beverage each day. 
Cooking with skim milk powder counts too. Try using milk in pancakes, oatmeal 
and soups. Talk with a doctor, nurse practitioner or registered dietitian if 
the child will not drink milk. He or she may be lactose intolerant.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child drinks a lot of milk. </strong></p> 
<p>Approach: Milk can be filling, and too much can spoil the child&rsquo;s 
appetite for other healthy foods. Limit milk if the child is drinking more than 
3 cups a day.</p> 
<p><strong>Feeding children aged 6-13 </strong></p> 
<p>At this age, children start to make more food decisions on their own, but 
they still need adults to make healthy choices available and guide their eating 
habits by teaching them why it is important to eat right and how to eat right.
</p> 
<p>Children aged 6-13 are also becoming more aware of their bodies. Promote 
healthy food choices and positive body image with these tips:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> If possible, involve children in planning and cooking simple meals. 
Children are more likely to eat food they&rsquo;ve helped prepare.</li> 
<li> Where appropriate, older children can help pack their own lunches and 
prepare snacks. Show them what foods they can have when they are hungry.</li> 
<li> Teach children that healthy bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and that 
children grow at different rates. Encourage them to accept themselves for who 
they are, not how they look.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child wants the same lunch every day. </strong></p> 
<p>Approach: As long as the child&rsquo;s lunch contains Food Group foods 
(e.g., a turkey sandwich, milk and an apple), it is acceptable for him or her 
to want the same thing every day. Offer a variety of foods for other meals and 
snacks to provide nutrients the child may be missing at lunch.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The child wants to snack all day and then won&rsquo;t 
eat supper.</strong></p> 
<p>Approach: Keep regular sit-down mealtimes and snack times, and serve only 
water in between so children will come to the table hungry. Offer healthy 
morning and after-school snacks at least one to two hours before mealtimes, 
followed by an evening snack.</p> 
<p><em> Adapted from Eat Right Be Active A guide for parents and caregivers of 
children ages 6-8, Nutrition Resource Centre, Toronto, Ontario, 2007</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feeding youth aged 14-18 </strong></p> 
<p>Healthy eating fuels growth, and also helps maintain a healthy body weight. 
The teen years mean periods of rapid growth and sexual maturity. Females 
develop earlier than males, but nutrient needs for both sexes are still high 
&ndash; a teenaged boy may need more food than the average adult.</p> 
<p>The Food Guide serving ranges are based on low activity levels, and will 
usually be enough food for non-active youth. Teens who are active (60 minutes 
or more each day) and/or going through a growth spurt may need more servings.
</p> 
<p>Teens&rsquo; bones grow fastest during pre-puberty and puberty. Offer three 
to four servings of milk and alternatives (e.g., milk, fortified soy beverage) 
daily to help teens develop strong bones for now and the future (i.e., reducing 
their risk for osteoporosis).</p> 
<p>Rates of overweight and obesity have increased for youth. Teens&rsquo; 
concerns about body weight and body image may result in dieting or a desire to 
be thinner or more muscular. Encourage healthy eating, feeling good about 
themselves anddaily physical activity for all youth, regardless of their 
weight. Refer to &ldquo;Section Three: Special Nutrition Considerations&rdquo; 
for more about helping youth who are struggling with weight issues.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The youth is not always interested in eating breakfast. 
</strong></p> 
<p>Approach: Teens&rsquo; internal clocks are set differently &ndash; they 
might not be able to get up early enough to eat breakfast. Try packing a 
breakfast with three or four Food Groups that they can take with them.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: The youth only wants to eat &ldquo;junk.&rdquo; </strong>
</p> 
<p>Approach: It may not be possible to control the amount of 
&ldquo;junk&rdquo; consumed when teens are not under supervision. Limit how 
often these treats are available in the residential facility. Be sure to 
provide healthy choices from the Food Groups whenever possible.</p> 
<p><strong>Behaviour: A youth is vegetarian. </strong></p> 
<p>Approach: See the information on vegetarianism in &ldquo;Section Three: 
Special Nutrition Considerations.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Section Three<br>
 Special Nutrition Considerations</h2> 
<h3>Children and youth with special needs</h3> 
<p> Any specific dietary considerations for children and youth in a 
residential setting need to be identified and documented; aregistered dietitian 
can help determine how to best meet nutritional needs.</p> 
<p>Some physical, developmental and/or mental health conditions and 
medications may affect a child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s food preferences, 
appetite or digestion (e.g., bowel regularity) or cause weight fluctuations. 
Always rule out a health issue before making dietary changes.</p> 
<p>In addition, for children and youth with developmental disabilities, autism 
and other communication exceptionalities, healthy eating habits, food rules and 
routines may need to be individually determined in consultation with the child 
or youth, qualified professionals, the child&rsquo;s/youth&rsquo;s case manager 
and/or the parents/guardians.</p> 
<p> Individualized learning goals for children and youth with special needs in 
relation to food can be part of a comprehensive approach to building daily 
living and communication skills and prompting appropriate behaviours. For 
example, the use of pictures of certain food items may be very important in 
helping a child or youth with autism to understand meal routines.</p> 
<p> For all children and youth, become familiar with individual behavioural 
issues, common challenges and side effects of medication, and monitor them 
closely to watch for what might be affecting their food intake.</p> 
<p>It is not realistic to list every possible condition that might have an 
impact on a child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s food intake; however, some of the 
more common challenges are described here.</p> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Food and behaviour </li> 
<li> Food allergies and intolerances</li> 
<li> Vegetarianism </li> 
<li> Healthy weights </li> 
<li> Dieting and eating disorders</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Special needs considerations </strong></p> 
<p>Children and youth with developmental disabilities, autism and other 
communication exceptionalities may exhibit varying food-related behaviours, 
preferences and sensitivities.</p> 
<p>Some children and youth may have challenges with certain textures, colours, 
smells or hot and cold temperatures. They may exhibit the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Eating very hot food without apparent concern about burning their mouth 
</li> 
<li> Avoiding crunchy or soft foods </li> 
<li> Refusing to use certain utensils </li> 
<li> Leaving the table because of the smell of certain foods </li> 
<li> Only eating (or avoiding completely) foods with certain colours</li> </ul>
<p>Children and youth may choose to eat such a limited range of foods that, at 
times, may place them at risk for nutritional deficiencies.</p> 
<p>For children and youth with special needs, food rules and routines may need 
to be individually determined in consultation with appropriate professionals, 
the individual and other family members (if possible), and made a part of the 
child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s plan of care.</p> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Food and behaviour </h3> 
<p>What determines a child&rsquo;s behaviour will vary greatly depending on 
the individual, and what works for one child may not work for another. And 
while there is little data available on the role of any specific food in 
extreme behaviours, providing nutritious foods at regular meals and snack times 
can help all children and youth.</p> 
<p>Here are some basic strategies that may help:</p> 
<p><strong>Serve meals and snacks at regular times. </strong></p> 
<p>Meals and snacks should be served about every two to three hours for 
preschoolers and three to four hours for older children and youth. Children and 
youth who skip meals or go hungry for long periods during the day will:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Be more irritable and moody</li> 
<li> Have a hard time paying attention and focusing </li> 
<li> Have less energy to play and participate in daily routines</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Serve healthy foods. </strong></p> 
<p>Including healthy foods from the four Food Groups provides a child&rsquo;s 
or youth&rsquo;s growing body with essential nutrients. For example:</p> 
<p>Whole grains (e.g., whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, whole grain, whole-wheat 
bread) provide carbohydrates that can actually have a calming effect. Be sure 
to provide at least the minimum number of servings of Grain Products each day.
</p> 
<p>Protein in a meal or snack can help keep children and youth fuller longer, 
keeping hunger at bay. Include protein when planning meals and snacks (e.g., 
meat, legumes, peanut butter, cheese, and yogurt).</p> 
<p><strong>Avoid sugary snack foods. </strong></p> 
<p>A diet that is high in sugary snacks likely lacks nutrients required to 
feed a child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s body and brain, such as protein and 
essential fats.</p> 
<p><strong>Skip the soda! </strong></p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much caffeinated cola, energy drink or coffee for a 
child or youth to feel the impact. Caffeine is a drug, and it can cause 
symptoms similar to those experienced by people under stress, such as 
irritability, anxiety, restlessness and nervousness.</p> 
<p><strong>Watch for food reactions. </strong></p> 
<p>While studies are limited and not conclusive, some research shows that some 
children may react negatively to food dyes and preservatives in food. In 
particular, chemical preservatives called &ldquo;benzoates&rdquo; and four 
specific artificial colours (tartrazine, sunset yellow, ponceau and carmoisine) 
may trigger hyperactive behaviour.</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Too much sugar? </strong></p> 
<p>Too much sugar in children&rsquo;s diets is often blamed for a range of 
poor behaviours, such as irritability, anxiety, violent behaviour and fatigue. 
However, eating sugar actually makes a person feel sleepy because it stimulates 
the production of serotonin, a &ldquo;sleep chemical,&rdquo; in the brain.</p> 
<p>Foods that contain large amounts of sugar, such as soft drinks, candies and 
other sweet foods, also contain artificial colours and preservatives, which may 
cause behavioural changes in some children.</p>

<h3>Food allergies and intolerances</h3> 
<p><strong>Food allergy &ndash; what is it? </strong></p> 
<p>A food allergy is a response of the immune system to a protein in a 
specific food. The reaction can range from mild to severe. It can be triggered 
by a very small amount of food, and it can occur very quickly after eating that 
food. In some children and youth, simple contact with an allergic food can 
cause a severe reaction.</p> 
<p> In order to keep a child with food allergies safe and avoid serious 
reactions, staff or foster parents should follow the directions provided by a 
registered dietitian, doctor or nurse practitioner and parents (if applicable).
</p> 
<p> Common food allergy symptoms include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Itching </li> 
<li> Rashes </li> 
<li> Hives </li> 
<li> Chest tightness </li> 
<li> Wheezing </li> 
<li> Swelling of the face, tongue, lips, eyes and/or throat </li> 
<li> Tingling lips</li> 
<li> Stomach cramps </li> 
<li> Diarrhea </li> 
<li>Vomiting</li> </ul> 
<p>Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare. They cause a rapid 
heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and unconsciousness, and can be 
life-threatening.</p> 
<p> Food allergies occur in about six percent of young children. Many outgrow 
certain allergies, such as egg and milk allergies. In Canada, the most common 
food allergies are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Peanuts </li> 
<li> Eggs </li> 
<li> Milk </li> 
<li> Tree nuts (e.g., Brazil nuts) </li> 
<li> Wheat </li> 
<li> Soy </li> 
<li> Sesame seeds</li> 
<li> Seafood</li> 
<li> Sulphites (sensitivity-causing food additive) </li> </ul> 
<p>Currently there is no cure for food allergies. The only option is complete 
avoidance of the specific food. Emergency treatment for anaphylaxis is the 
immediate injection of adrenaline through an auto-injector device 
(EpiPen&trade;) followed by further treatment at a hospital emergency room.</p> 
<p><strong>Food intolerance &ndash; what is it? </strong></p> 
<p>Food intolerance is a sensitivity reaction to food that does not involve an 
immune-system response. While symptoms of intolerance vary and may be mistaken 
for a food allergy, typically the response is gastrointestinal and caused by 
the body&rsquo;s inability to break down certain components in food. Common 
symptoms include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Cramping </li> 
<li> Bloating </li> 
<li> Diarrhea</li> </ul> 
<p>For example, lactose intolerance is caused by the body&rsquo;s inability to 
break down lactose, a natural sugar found in milk. Unlike a milk allergy, where 
milk products must be avoided completely, a child or youth with lactose 
intolerance can usually still eat small amounts of milk products with meals, 
such as &frac12; to 1 cup of milk, hard cheese and yogurt made with active 
cultures (read the label to be sure).</p> 
<p>Lactose-reduced milk and fortified soy beverage are also options for those 
with lactose intolerance. Additionalalternative sources of dietary calcium and 
vitamin D, such as fortified orange juice, may be necessary.</p> 
<p>Be aware that lactose intolerance is more common amongst people of 
Aboriginal, Asian, and African descent. For individuals who don&rsquo;t drink 
milk or fortified soy beverage, speak with a registered dietitian about the 
need for dietary supplements.</p> 
<p><strong>What to do? </strong></p> 
<p>If a child or youth is suspected to have a food allergy or intolerance, he 
or she should see a doctor for a reliable allergy test. When feeding children 
and youth with food allergies or intolerances, help minimize risks by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Using the recommendations/directions provided by a registered dietitian 
to help plan appropriate, safe meals that will meet a child&rsquo;s or 
youth&rsquo;s nutritional needs. Eliminating foods without proper guidance can 
lead to nutritional deficiencies and have a serious impact on health.</li> 
<li> Educating other children and youth about the importance of avoiding foods 
that may trigger reactions. Even so, they may not be able to comprehend the 
severity or impact of their food choices (e.g., eating a chocolate bar that 
contains nuts) on another child or youth.</li> 
<li> Training staff and foster parents and establishing rules to recognize and 
manage severe food allergies and avoid allergic reactions.</li> </ul> 
<p>For a child or youth who lacks the communication skills to describe 
intestinal discomfort, it is important to check with individuals who are 
familiar with his or her history regarding sensitivities to foods and/or 
medications.</p>

<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>It is important to learn the signs and symptoms of allergies.
</strong></p> 
<p> Beyond the obvious physical signs (swelling, hives, etc.), some children 
experiencing a reaction will put their hands in their mouth, or pull or scratch 
at their tongue. Their voice may change (i.e., become hoarse or squeaky), and 
they may slur their words. If an allergic reaction is suspected, get medical 
help immediately.</p> 
<p> Some children will use different words to describe an allergic reaction: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> This food is too spicy. </li> 
<li> My tongue is hot (or burning). </li> 
<li> It feels like something is poking my tongue. </li> 
<li> My tongue (or mouth) is tingling (or burning or itching). </li> 
<li> My tongue feels like there is hair on it. </li> 
<li> There&rsquo;s a frog in my throat or There&rsquo;s something stuck in my 
throat.</li> 
<li> My tongue feels full (or heavy). </li> 
<li> My lips feel tight. </li> 
<li> It feels like there are bugs in there (to describe itchy ears). </li> 
<li> My throat feels thick. </li> 
<li> It feels like a bump is on the back of my tongue/throat. </li> </ul>

<h3>Vegetarianism </h3> 
<p>Children and youth follow vegetarian diets for a variety of reasons, such 
as concern for the environment, a simple dislike of meat, or cultural or 
religious beliefs. It is important to support a child or youth in this personal 
choice &ndash; find out from him or her which foods are included in their diet.
</p> 
<p>Vegetarian meals can be budget-wise, nutritionally balanced and easy to 
plan:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The eating patterns of vegetarian children and youth are the same as 
those of non-vegetarians; follow the recommendations of the Food Guides, using 
meat alternatives instead of meat. Meat alternatives include:
<ul> 
<li> Peanut butter and other nut butters </li> 
<li> Legumes (e.g., chickpeas, kidney beans, black beans, lentils) </li> 
<li> Eggs </li> 
<li> Tofu </li> 
<li> Nuts and seeds </li> 
<li> Soy-based meat substitutes (e.g., meatless burgers)</li> 
<li> Fish (some vegetarians still eat fish &ndash; check personal preferences) 
</li> </ul> </li> 
<li> If possible, avoid making separate meals for vegetarian children and 
youth. Instead, replace meat with alternatives or find interesting vegetarian 
choices that the whole group can enjoy.</li> </ul>

<li> &ldquo;Vegetarianism FAQs&rdquo;, EatRight Ontario</li> 
<li> &ldquo;Meal planning for the vegetarian teen&rdquo; , EatRight Ontario
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>What is the reason? </strong></p> 
<p>Some youth, especially teenage girls, may see vegetarianism as a way to 
lose weight or cover up their intention to diet. Discuss the reasoning for 
their choice and ensure that vegetarian teens are still eating regular meals 
and snacks.</p> 
<p> If you notice that the vegetarian diet is leading to more extreme food 
restrictions or behaviours, determine the appropriate response through 
consultation with relevant individuals, e.g., parents/ guardians (if possible), 
doctor, nurse practitioner and case manager, and aregistered dietitian who 
specializes in vegetarianism and eating disorders.</p> 
<p><strong>What about vegans? </strong></p> 
<p>A vegan is a vegetarian who follows a diet that does not include any foods 
of animal origin &ndash; no meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese or other 
dairy products. A vegan diet can be healthy if foods are chosen wisely and 
there is enough food to support growth, development and appetite.</p> 
<p>Because there are several nutrients that may be difficult for a child or 
youth to get from a vegan diet &ndash; such as iron, calcium, vitamin B12 and 
zinc &ndash; it is important to have a registered dietitian develop a 
nutritional plan that provides appropriate nutrients and calories. A doctor or 
nurse practitioner may be able to provide additional support and/or a referral 
to a registered dietitian.</p>

<h3>Healthy weights </h3> 
<p>There is no one ideal weight for children and youth, especially since they 
are continually growing and changing as part of normal development. Children 
and youth need enough calories to support growth and development, but not too 
many calories, which might lead to excessive weight gain.</p> 
<p>It is important to promote healthy eating and physical activity for all 
children and youth at a licensed residential setting. Promote healthy eating as 
a means to feel strong and healthy, not changing looks or losing weight.</p> 
<p>There are several concerns for an overweight or obese child or youth: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Risk of health problems including bone, muscle, joint and hormonal 
problems</li> 
<li> Sleep difficulties </li> 
<li> Poor self-esteem or being the target of bullying </li> 
<li> Obesity in adulthood </li> 
<li> Major risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Do not forbid or force. </strong></p> 
<p>Forbidding foods like cookies and candy can actually make children and 
youth want them more. Instead, provide occasional treats in reasonable portion 
sizes.</p> 
<p>Children and youth who are forced or pressured (e.g. clean their plates) to 
eat may lose touch with their body&rsquo;s natural appetite control. This can 
lead to overeating and possible weight problems or eating disorders.</p> 
<p><strong>Caring for an overweight or obese child</strong></p> 
<p> The causes of obesity are not as simple as too much food intake and too 
little physical activity, especially for children and youth experiencing 
physical, emotional and social challenges. For children and youth who might be 
overweight or obese, consider these suggestions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Offer healthy food choices.</strong> Overweight children and 
youth should grow into a healthy weight &ndash; not lose weight. In most cases, 
this can be achieved through healthy eating and daily physical activity. Note: 
Obese children and youth may require a medically supervised diet.</li> 
<li> <strong>Get moving!</strong> Children and youth need 90 minutes of 
physical activity every day. Replace screen time (TV, computer, video games) 
with supervised outdoor play or sports. Find out more aboutphysical activity. 
</li> 
<li> <strong>Follow a plan.</strong> An obese child or youth should have a 
care plan developed by health-care professionals.</li> 
<li> <strong>Measure weight with medical advice.</strong> A doctor or nurse 
practitioner can monitor a child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s weight to see how it 
is changing over time &ndash; that is what counts, not a single measurement at 
one point in time. Putting a child or youth on a scale regularly to check if he 
or she has lost or gained pounds could cause poor self-esteem and may lead to 
unhealthy dieting or food habits.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a child or youth loses or gains weight rapidly 
without apparent cause, medical attention is required.</p>

<h3>Dieting and eating disorders </h3> 
<p>While it is normal for teenagers to be self-conscious about their body, 
constantly worrying about weight or restricting food is not healthy. Teens are 
still growing and need the right amounts of food and nutrients to be healthy. 
Taking in too few calories and nutrients can have serious negative effects on 
their health.</p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Dieting is not just a girls&rsquo; thing.</strong></p> 
<p> Studies show that there has been an increase in body image concerns among 
males. With males, the focus is not usually on being thin, but rather being 
buff and lean or muscular. Boys may get into unhealthy habits such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Taking protein supplements</li> 
<li> Steroid use </li> 
<li> Binge eating </li> </ul> 
<p>Make sure to have positive body discussions with teen boys and watch them 
for unhealthy dieting habits. Consult a registered dietitian, doctor or nurse 
practitioner if body image issues arise.</p> 
<p>Try the following suggestions when dealing with children and youth who seem 
preoccupied with their weight or are dieting:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Discuss why they are dieting and what effect it is having on their life. 
Acknowledge what they feel.</li> 
<li> Advise them that dieting doesn&rsquo;t work and may actually lead them to 
overeat. A better approach is to eat healthy foods most often and in 
appropriate portions, limit treat-type snack foods (but not restrict them 
totally), and be active every day.</li> 
<li> Praise children and youth for qualities other than appearance. Children 
and youth who feel good about themselves are less likely to diet.</li> 
<li>Do not support dieting habits by serving &ldquo;diet&rdquo; meals and only 
low-calorie foods. All children and youth should be served the same healthy 
food choices at mealtimes.</li> 
<li> Adults can be positive role models by showing that they accept their 
body&rsquo;s shape and size as well as those of others. Where appropriate, eat 
healthy foods and be active with the children and youth in the licensed 
residential setting.</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Eating disorders </strong></p> 
<p>Eating disorders are not about food or vanity; they are coping strategies 
to deal with deeper emotional problems. Clinical eating disorders that are 
recognized as medical conditions are defined by strict criteria. They include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Anorexia nervosa - individuals are obsessed with controlling their eating 
in an attempt to control their lives; starvation-type dieting with significant 
weight loss is typical</li> 
<li> Bulimia nervosa &ndash; individuals binge eat and purge in cycles, and 
they are driven by a desire to regulate feelings; purging methods may include 
vomiting, laxatives, enemas or diuretics, excessive exercise, dieting and 
skipping meals</li> 
<li> Binge eating disorder &ndash; individuals eat excessive amounts of food 
at one time, usually without compensating</li> 
<li> Eating disorder not otherwise specified &ndash; individuals experience a 
mix of the above clinical eating disorders</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Adapted from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC) 
</em></p> 
<p>Eating disorders can have a serious negative impact on overall health and 
can even cause death. A child or youth with an eating disorder requires 
specialized medical attention.</p> 
<p>Children and youth who experience only some of the symptoms may still 
suffer from disordered eating (abnormal eating habits including restrictive 
dieting). For definitions, symptoms and strategies for dealing with clinical 
eating disorders and disordered eating, see theNational Eating Disorder 
Information Centre (NEDIC).</p> 
<p><strong>Early warning signs </strong></p> 
<p>When dealing with eating disorders, dieting and disordered eating, caution 
is needed to avoid contributing further to mental and physical health problems. 
Professional help may be required if a child&rsquo;s or youth&rsquo;s dieting 
has gone too far, or if these early warning signs are noticed:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The child or youth over- or underestimates the size of his or her body, 
and is ashamed by his or her appearance, size, height or physical maturity</li> 
<li> Talks negatively about parts of his or her body </li> 
<li> Talks about feeling &ldquo;fat&rdquo; or &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;</li> 
<li>Overdoes physical activity </li> 
<li> Is excessively concerned about weight, shape and calories </li> 
<li> Restricts food intake or strictly avoids certain foods, particularly 
those considered &ldquo;fattening&rdquo;</li> 
<li> Adopts unusual eating habits, skips meals or often says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 
not hungry&rdquo;</li> 
<li> Females menstruate irregularly or skip periods </li> 
<li> Feels guilty or ashamed about eating </li> 
<li> Loses a noticeable amount of weight, or weight fluctuates quite a bit</li>
</ul> 
<p><em>Adapted from the Student Nutrition &amp; Activity Manual, 
Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, 2006</em></p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Disordered eating is not always about being thin. </strong></p> 
<p>Disordered eating includes a wide range of abnormal eating behaviours. 
Children and youth may suffer from:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> pica (eating non-food items) </li> 
<li> Prader-Willi syndrome (genetic disorder that causes insatiable appetite)
</li> 
<li> compulsive eating </li> 
<li> hoarding or hiding food</li> 
<li> irregular, chaotic eating patterns</li> 
<li> Often, physical hunger and fullness signals are ignored. If a child or 
youth may be suffering from this type of disordered eating, it is important to 
get the advice of an appropriate health-care professional. For more information 
on various types of disordered eating, visit theNational Eating Disorder 
Information Centre (NEDIC).</li> </ul>

<h2>Section Four<br>
 Cultural Considerations</h2> 
<h3>Introduction </h3> 
<p>Considering the cultural and religious needs of children and youth is 
essential to helping them adapt, feel accepted and build their self-esteem. 
Similarly, it is important to build cultural awareness of all children and 
youth by exposing everyone in the group or foster home to food from particular 
cultural backgrounds. Here are some ideas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Provide some meals and snacks that are representative of particular 
cultural traditions</li> 
<li> Accept that some children and youth may not want to try mainstream or 
traditional foods</li> 
<li> Respect any food restrictions </li> 
<li> Observe some cultural celebrations by buying or preparing a special dish 
or snack. For example, some East Asian cultures enjoy moon cakes during 
Mid-Autumn Festival</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> How to find out about cultural and/or religious food traditions </li> 
<li>Considerations for Aboriginal children and youth</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Cultural and religious food-based traditions </h3> 
<p>It is not realistic to expect foster parents and staff at licensed 
residential settings to know every culture&rsquo;s and religion&rsquo;s food 
habits, celebrations that involve special foods, and dietary restrictions, and 
it is impossible to cover them all in this tool kit.</p> 
<p>The most important thing to do: </p> 
<p><strong>Ask the children and youth about their cultural or religious food 
traditions or restrictions.</strong>Do not assume that all children and youth 
from a particular ethnic group or culture follow the same traditions. They may 
be able to tell you what food traditions (if any) they observed in their 
families, as well as some of their favourite traditional foods.</p>

<h3>Aboriginal children and youth &ndash; nutrition and traditional foods</h3> 
<p>Just as with other cultures, there are various traditions followed by 
different Aboriginal groups across Ontario. Many Aboriginal people eat a diet 
made up primarily of store-bought foods, sometimes supplemented with 
much-valued traditional foods. Traditional foods are more often included in 
special ceremonies or celebrations (e.g., harvest feast). Some Aboriginal 
people may not eat any traditional foods at all.</p> 
<p>Traditional food choices depend on the Aboriginal group as well as the 
region of Ontario from which the child or youth came. By talking to children 
and youth, you can discover what traditions are important to them and which 
foods have special meaning as comfort or celebration foods.</p> 
<p>Below is some basic information about traditional Aboriginal foods. In some 
regions, these foods will be more difficult to obtain and may not be practical.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Traditional animal foods include foods from the land (e.g., moose, 
venison and rabbit), sky (e.g., goose or duck) and water (e.g., pickerel or 
white fish). More readily available alternatives may include farm-raised 
animals such as elk, deer and bison.</li> 
<li> Wild plant foods are used sometimes and may include greens (e.g., 
fiddleheads), berries (e.g., blueberries, strawberries and raspberries) and 
wild rice. Store-bought varieties are good substitutes.</li> 
<li> Where possible, recipes, such as soups and stews, can be adapted to 
include wild meats, such as moose, venison and rabbit, instead of the meat 
called for in the recipe (e.g., beef or chicken).</li> 
<li> Flavours and recipes tend to be simple and not highly spiced; seasoning 
such as garlic, herbs, curry, salt and pepper are not commonly used.</li> 
<li> In Northern communities, carrots, potatoes, frozen mixed vegetables and 
corn are commonly available vegetables, while fresh apples, bananas, oranges, 
and frozen and canned fruit tend to be the more commonly available fruits.</li> 
<li> Beans, corn and squash &ndash; known as the &ldquo;three sisters&rdquo; 
&ndash; have traditionally been a staple in many regions of Ontario. They are 
often cooked together (e.g., &ldquo;Three Sisters Soup&rdquo;)</li> 
<li> Bannock is a non-traditional bread that is commonly enjoyed.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Obesity and diabetes are major health concerns for Aboriginal 
children.</strong></p> 
<p>These health concerns have arisen from reduced access to traditional diets 
based on hunting, gathering and fishing, sedentary lifestyles and increased 
consumption of refined, higher-calorie foods and drinks.</p> 
<p>Like non-Aboriginal children, obesity and diabetes result from diets 
containing too many calories, especially from fatty, processed and fried foods. 
At the same time, physical activity levels have decreased as video-game playing 
and TV viewing have increased.</p> 
<p>Both obesity and Aboriginal ancestry are risk factors for diabetes. The 
rates of type 2 diabetes in Aboriginal children and youth have increased 
dramatically over the past two decades.</p> 
<p>Diabetes can lead to premature blindness, kidney failure, amputation (loss 
of limbs) and heart disease. Healthy food choices and physical activity are key 
factors in reducing the risk of diabetes as well as effectively managing 
diabetes.</p> 
<p>For Aboriginal children and youth who are obese or have diabetes, consult a 
registered dietitian to plan appropriate meals and snacks.</p> 
<p><strong>For more information </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Where appropriate, consider linking with local Aboriginal groups and/or 
theOntario Federation of Indian Friendship Centres so that children and youth 
can participate in cultural events at locations where traditional foods are 
often prepared and served by staff. Alternatively, if possible, Aboriginal 
elders may be able to come to your home or facility to teach children and youth 
about traditional methods of gathering, eating and cooking traditional foods.
</li> 
<li> Contact the local Aboriginal Health Access Centre. Find out what programs 
and services are available. Some centres employ registered dietitians or other 
health-care providers who can assist with planning healthy and culturally 
appropriate meals and snacks for Aboriginal children and youth.</li>

 Menu Planning &ndash; The Basics</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p> 
<p>Preparing budget-wise, healthy meals and snacks that are appealing to 
children and youth takes some planning. This section will be especially helpful 
for those newer to menu planning; however, everyone will find the menu planning 
checklist and fast food makeovers of interest.</p> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> The benefits of menu planning </li> 
<li> Seven simple steps for menu planning </li> 
<li> Reproducible menu planning form </li> 
<li> Menu planning checklist </li> 
<li> Sample menu plans </li> 
<li> Fast food makeovers </li> 
<li> Meal and snack ideas</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>The benefits of menu planning </h3> 
<p>Investing a small amount of time in menu planning is well worth the effort. 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Saves money</strong> &ndash; Take advantage of store specials and 
seasonal produce, rely more on wholesome foods that are less costly and more 
nutritious than convenience foods such as frozen pizzas, and use leftovers to 
minimize wasted food.</li> 
<li> <strong>Saves time</strong> &ndash; Make fewer last-minute trips to the 
grocery store.</li> 
<li> <strong>Makes it easier to serve nutritious meals</strong> &ndash; 
Planning allows you to include healthy Food Group choices that will be 
appealing, culturally appropriate and child- and youth-friendly.</li> 
<li> <strong>Ensures meals meet special dietary needs</strong> &ndash; 
Specific advice of a health-care professional can be accommodated (e.g., 
children with food allergies).</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Seven simple steps for menu planning </h3> 
<p>There is no right or wrong way to go about menu planning. These tips can 
help make the process easier in many licensed residential settings:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Regularly ask for input from the children and youth (if appropriate). 
</li> 
<li> List the meals and snacks you often serve (this can be a handy reference 
for future planning).</li> 
<li> Make a list of food supplies. Spoiled food is a waste of money, so plan 
to first use up the food already at hand. Check the fridge, cupboards and 
freezer.</li> 
<li> Smaller-scale facilities and homes can check grocery store flyers for 
specials to include in the menu plan. Refer to &ldquo;Section Six: Budget-wise 
Shopping&rdquo; for additional ideas.</li> 
<li> Plan three meals and two to three snacks a day. Try the sample menu 
planning form.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tips: </strong> 
<ul> 
<li> Start by slotting in the meals and snacks listed in step 2 above. </li> 
<li>For better nutrition and more interesting mealtimes, think variety 
(colour, taste, textures, foods, cuisines) from meal to meal, and from day to 
day.</li> 
<li>Fill in any remaining meals and snacks. The ideas on page 43 and sample 
menus on page 44 may be helpful.</li> 
<li>Reminder: 
<ul> 
<li> Breakfast &ndash; food from at least three Food Groups </li> 
<li>Lunch and dinner &ndash; food from four Food Groups </li> 
<li> Snacks &ndash; food from at least two Food Groups</li> 
<li> Have water for drinking available at all times </li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Refer to page 8 for a list of healthy foods to serve most often. </li> 
<li>For good nutritional value, include plenty of foods from the &ldquo;best 
buys.&quot;</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Compare the menu against the Menu Planning Checklist on page 40 as a 
guide. Make adjustments as needed. Consider involving the child/youth at this 
stage for some hands-on life skills training.</li> 
<li> Make a grocery list based on the menu plan. If food will be purchased at 
a grocery store (as opposed to ordering it, as a larger facility may do), 
organize the list according to the store layout to save time when shopping.</li>

<h3>Menu planning checklist</h3> 
<p>Use this checklist as a guide. It can be adapted for a particular care 
setting and the needs of the children and youth.</p> Menu planning checklist 
<br> <strong>Overall considerations</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; Children and youth 
have been consulted in developing this menu plan (if appropriate). <br>
 &nbsp; 
There is the time, kitchen equipment and budget to follow through on this menu. 
<br>  &nbsp; Any special dietary needs (allergies, intolerances, medical 
conditions, medications) have been planned for in consultation with a qualified 
health-care provider (registered dietitian, doctor, nurse practitioner). <br>
 
&nbsp; Menu plans are posted and substitutions are noted on the menu plan 
(where applicable). <br>
<strong>Healthy meals and snacks</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; 
Breakfasts include foods from at least three Food Groups. <br>
 &nbsp; 
Lunches/dinners include foods from four Food Groups. <br>
 &nbsp; Snacks 
include foods from at least two Food Groups. <br>
 &nbsp; A variety of foods is 
served from each Food Group, avoiding repetition within the week as much as 
possible. <br>
 &nbsp; Every day, serve at least one dark-green vegetable 
(broccoli, romaine lettuce and spinach) and one orange vegetable (carrots, 
sweet potatoes, winter squash or pumpkin; apricots, cantaloupes, mangoes, 
nectarines, papaya and peaches also contain vitamin A and can be chosen instead 
of one orange vegetable). <br>
 &nbsp; Be budget-wise and choose fresh in 
season, and frozen or canned at other times. <br>
 &nbsp; Within a meal, 
balance nutritious higher-fat choices (peanut butter, cheese, meats and nuts) 
with lower-fat foods (raw vegetables, beans, rice and milk). <br>
 &nbsp; Each 
day, at least half of the grain products arewhole-grain (barley, brown rice, 
oats, quinoa, wild rice, couscous, breads, pitas, tortillas, roti, crackers, 
oatmeal and pasta). <br>
 &nbsp; Hard cheeses rather than processed cheese 
slices and cheese spreads are served. Cream cheese and cottage cheese are less 
nutritious and are served less often. <br>
 &nbsp; Meat alternatives such as 
beans, chickpeas, soybeans, lentils, eggs and tofu are served often (try for 
two or three times a week or more). <br>
 &nbsp; Processed/canned luncheon 
meats (e.g. ham, beef and balogna) are limited. (Serve meat alternatives or 
slice up cooked meat &ndash; beef, goat, poultry, pork or wild game &ndash; 
instead.) <br>
 &nbsp; Each weekly menu includes at least two Food Guide 
servings (&frac12; cup x 2) oflow-mercury fish (light canned tuna, canned 
salmon, char, herring, mackerel, sardines and trout). <br>
 &nbsp; Salt is not 
put out on the table. (Try salsa, pepper or Parmesan cheese instead.) <br>
 
&nbsp; Processed foods (e.g., frozen pizzas, boxed macaroni and cheese, corn 
dogs, etc.) are used infrequently and not served daily. <br>
 &nbsp; Meals and 
snacks are set for the same times each day. <br>
 &nbsp; Only water is served 
between meals and snacks (to avoid spoiling appetites). <br>
 &nbsp; When 
desserts are served, they are most often Food Group-based (rice pudding, milk 
pudding, fruit crisps, yogurt topped with fruit, fruit salad, bread pudding, 
carrot cake, banana bread and date squares). <br>
<strong>Cooking methods
</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; Food is flavoured with herbs, spices, onion, garlic, 
etc., and prepared with little or no added fat, sugar or salt. <br>
 &nbsp; 
Visible fat/skin is removed from meats and poultry before cooking. Cooked 
ground meats are drained of excess fat. <br>
 &nbsp; Canola, olive and soybean 
oils and soft margarines that are trans fat-free are used. Butter, lard and 
shortening are limited. Margarines containing trans fats are not served. <br>
 
&nbsp; Lower-fat cooking methods (baking, broiling, grilling, steaming, 
roasting and poaching) are used most often. <br>
<strong>Amounts of food served
</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; Children and youth are provided with enough food to at 
least satisfy the Food Guide recommendations. <br>
 &nbsp; Active children and 
youth and those going through a growth spurt may need more servings to satisfy 
their needs. <br>
 &nbsp; Whenever possible, food is served family-style 
&ndash; children can help themselves. If that is not possible, serve 
appropriate child- or youth-sized portions with the option for seconds. <br>

<strong>Drinks served</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; 2 cups of powdered (reconstituted), 
skim, 1% or 2% milk or fortified soy beverage are offered to every child daily, 
and 3 cups of milk are offered to youth daily (may include milk used in 
cooking). <br>
 &nbsp; Vegetables and fruit are served more often than 100% 
juice. <br>
 &nbsp; Juice is limited each day to no more than &frac12; to 1 cup.
<br>  &nbsp; These drinks are avoided or seldom offered: fruit cocktails, fruit 
punches, lemonade, fruit drinks and soft drinks. <br>
 &nbsp; Water is 
offered/available throughout the day to satisfy thirst, especially on hot days 
or when children and youth are active. <br>
<strong>Meals are appealing and 
respect lifestyles, culture and religion</strong> <br>
 &nbsp; There is a good 
variety of well-matched flavours, colours, temperatures and textures (cooked, 
raw, crispy, crunchy, chewy, smooth/chunky consistencies) and shapes (shredded, 
in strips, cubes, chunks and slices of different sizes). <br>
 &nbsp; Seasonal 
vegetables and fruit are offered for great taste and good food value. <br>
 
&nbsp; For younger children, food is often served separately, and mixed dishes 
are introduced gradually over time. <br>
 &nbsp; When a new food is introduced, 
it is served alongside some familiar and well-liked foods. <br>
 &nbsp; Some 
foods that children and youth can help prepare are included (wherever 
appropriate). <br>
 &nbsp; At least one food item that children and youth are 
known to like is available, even if it is just bread, pasta, rice or potatoes. 
<br>  &nbsp; Especially for the younger children (aged 3 &ndash; 6), some 
finger foods are included. <br>
 &nbsp; Foods that pose a high choking risk for 
young children have been avoided. <br>
 &nbsp; Cultural and religious food 
habits and restrictions are respected. <br>
 &nbsp; Vegetarian meal options are 
offered as needed. <br>

<h3>Fast food makeovers</h3> 
<p>Many children and youth enjoy &ldquo;fast&rdquo; foods like French fries, 
pizza and hot dogs, and may turn to these foods for comfort. Although they are 
convenient, they offer few nutrients, typically include trans fat and lots of 
sodium (salt) and are costly. They should be served infrequently and in small 
portions. The following table offers ideas to boost the nutrition in these fast 
foods.</p> &ldquo;FAST&rdquo; FOODS MADE BETTER <br>

with skim milk powder).</p> 
<p><strong>Simple school lunches &ndash; peanut-free*</strong></p> 
<p>When packing lunches for a child or youth who attends school in Ontario, 
chances are that it has to be peanut-free. Here are some simple suggestions:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Vegetarian chili, a small whole-wheat roll with a slice of hard cheese, a 
fruit cup and water</li> 
<li> Curried beef with vegetables, pita wedges, a kiwi, a mini banana muffin 
and water</li> 
<li> Chicken thigh, whole-wheat couscous, raw carrots, a wedge of cantaloupe 
and milk</li> 
<li> Cheese-and-fruit kabob, whole-wheat pita wedges, salsa and refried beans 
for dipping, and fortified soy beverage</li> </ul>

rice noodles are not available. Add vegetables in season or frozen vegetables, 
an egg for protein and jarred peanut sauce to top it off.</p> 
<p><strong>Some Aboriginal food ideas </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Moose or venison stew</strong> Make wild-meat stews by using the 
same recipes used for beef stew and replacing the meat. The stew could be 
served with bannock or fry bread and milk.</p>

<h2>Section Six <br>
 Budget-wise Shopping</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> 
<p> Whether food is ordered from a supplier or bought at a grocery store, it 
is important to build the menu around nutritious and budget-wise buys. This is 
especially true in Northern and remote communities where food costs are higher 
and the variety of foods available is limited.</p> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> How to read labels to make better choices </li> 
<li> Best buys within each Food Group </li> 
<li> Top five tips for saving money while you shop </li> 
<li>Community food programs that may help with budget-wise healthy food choices
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Less costly foods are often more nutritious. </strong></p> 
<p>Shopping for less costly foods can be healthier since the focus is on 
basic, whole foods, such as carrots, cabbage, turnips, apples, beans (e.g., 
kidney beans, chick peas), milk powder, canned fish, whole-grain or enriched 
pasta, oatmeal and rice. These are more nutritious and less expensive than 
processed convenience foods, such as boxed macaroni and cheese, fruit drinks, 
frozen pizza, hot dogs, chicken nuggets and fish sticks.</p> 
<p>Choosing more wholesome, natural foods over highly processed foods also 
provides a good example for children and youth of how to eat right on a budget.
</p> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>How to read labels to make better choices </h3> 
<p>It is easier to eat right when the kitchen is stocked with healthy choices. 
When choosing cereals, soups and other packaged foods, compare their Nutrition 
Facts tables.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Check the serving sizes on each brand to see if 
you are comparing similar amounts.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the brand with more vitamins, minerals and 
fibre.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Choose the brand with fewer calories and less 
sodium, saturated fat and trans fat.</p>

<h3>Best Buys in Vegetables and Fruit <br>
 Choose dark-green and orange 
vegetables and fruits more often.</h3> 
<p><strong>Fresh </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> fresh Ontario vegetables and fruit &ndash; buy in season </li> 
<li> apples, oranges and potatoes in pre-packaged bags rather than 
individually (try different recipes to use them before they spoil)</li> 
<li> produce at local pick-your-own farms </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Buy a variety of vegetables and fruit including 
dark-green and orange vegetables and fruit for the best nutritional value. 
Store vegetables and fruit properly so they will not spoil too quickly. Pick 
your own wild berries to eat fresh or freeze.</p> 
<p><strong>Frozen and canned </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> frozen vegetables and fruit in bags rather than boxes </li> 
<li> peas, corn, green beans, mixed vegetables and spinach, which tend to be 
the best buys in frozen products</li> 
<li> &ldquo;no name&rdquo; frozen or canned products or lower-priced 
brand-name products</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Canned and frozen vegetables and fruit are a better 
buy when fresh vegetables and fruit are not in season. Compare the prices of 
canned products using unit pricing to find the best buy.</p> 
<p><strong>Juices</strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> juice in large containers instead of small &ldquo;juice boxes&rdquo;</li> 
<li> juices made from 100% pure frozen juice concentrate, which are nutritious 
and an excellent value</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips! </strong>100% pure unsweetened juice is healthier than a 
fruit drink or punch. Once opened, keep juice in a closed container in the 
fridge to prevent loss of vitamin C.</p> 
<p>Find out what is in season, review seasonal recipes and find pick-your-own 
farms atFoodland Ontario.</p> 
<p><em>Adapted from Ottawa Public Health</em></p> 
<h3>Best Buys in Grain Products <br>
 Choose whole-grain and enriched products 
more often.</h3> 
<p><strong>Breads </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> day-old breads and buns (if they get stale, heat in the oven for a short 
time to make into croutons or bread crumbs)</li> 
<li> &ldquo;no name&rdquo; brands </li> 
<li>bread on special (it can be frozen for up to two months) </li> 
<li>pre-packaged bagels and rolls </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips! </strong>Look for &ldquo;whole grain, whole-wheat 
flour&rdquo; as the first ingredient on the label. It has more fibre than white 
flour and is your best nutritional value.</p> 
<p><strong>Breakfast cereals </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip;</p> 
<ul> 
<li> no name&rdquo; brands </li> 
<li> larger packages </li> 
<li> large flake or quick cook oatmeal, Red River or cream of wheat cereals 
</li> 
<li> unsweetened instead of sweetened cereals </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Cereals made from whole wheat or bran (oat, wheat, 
corn) are good sources of fibre. Look for those with four grams or more of 
dietary fibre per serving.</p> 
<p><strong>Pasta, rice and grains </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> pasta and rice on special or in bulk (they will keep for a long time when 
stored in a dry place)</li> 
<li> couscous, bulgur or millet in bulk (they also add variety to your diet) 
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Whole-wheat pasta and brown rice provide more fibre 
than refined grains. Look for these foods on special.</p> 
<p><strong>More expensive items</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Specialty breads (e.g., pumpernickel, rye, pita, sourdough) may cost up 
to twice as much as regular bread, but they provide variety and are still 
relatively inexpensive</li> 
<li> The more processed the product (e.g., crackers, pre-seasoned noodles and 
rice preparations), the more expensive they are</li> 
<li> Store-made bakery products (e.g., donuts, muffins and croissants) are 
expensive and higher in fat and sugar</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Adapted from Ottawa Public Health.</em></p> 
<h3>Best Buys in Milk and Alternatives <br>
 Choose lower-fat milk products 
more often.</h3> 
<p><strong>Milk </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> milk in bags or recyclable plastic jugs, which are cheaper than milk in 
cardboard boxes</li> 
<li> skim milk powder, which is cheaper than liquid milk </li> 
<li> fortified soy beverage &ndash; offer to children who do not drink milk 
(flavoured varieties may be more expensive)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Use lower-fat milk or evaporated milk instead of 
cream to make recipes more nutritious, lower in fat and less expensive. Dry or 
reconstituted skim milk powder can add a nutritious boost to baking and is less 
expensive than fluid milk.</p> 
<p><strong>Cheese </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> &ldquo;no name&rdquo; and store-wrapped cheese </li> 
<li> mild and medium cheese, which are cheaper than old cheese </li> 
<li> a block of cheese rather than shredded cheese </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Buy blocks of cheese when on sale and freeze. Thawed 
cheese will crumble, but it is just as nutritious.</p> 
<p><strong>Yogurt </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> yogurt in large containers, which are a better value than single-serving 
cups</li> 
<li> &ldquo;no name&rdquo; yogurt and store brands </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips! </strong>Plain yogurt is the best choice. Add your own 
flavourings. To cut down on the amount of fat in recipes, use low-fat yogurt 
instead of sour cream.</p> 
<p><strong>Other sources of calcium </strong></p> 
<p>For variety try&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>tofu, soy and rice beverages that have been fortified with calcium and 
vitamin D (use them in place of milk in any recipe)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Food Safety Tip! </strong>Check the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date 
on all dairy products. If the date has passed, throw it out.</p>

<h3>Best Buys in Meat and Alternatives <br>
 Choose leaner meats, poultry and 
fish as well as dried peas, beans and lentils more often.</h3> 
<p><strong>Meat alternatives </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> meat alternatives such as eggs, dried beans and peas, lentils and/or 
tofu, and substitute them for meat in recipes</li> 
<li> legumes (peas, beans and lentils) in dry form or cans </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips! </strong>Legumes are low in fat and rich in fibre. Add them 
to soups, pasta sauces and salads.</p> 
<p><strong>Cuts of meat </strong></p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> stew meat, shoulder (pork), chuck/blade, brisket point (less tender), 
cross rib, sirloin tip, outside round or bottom, inside round or organ meat</li>
<li> when meat is on sale </li> 
<li>regular ground beef for recipes such as spaghetti sauce, chili con carne 
and shepherd&rsquo;s pie (drain and rinse cooked ground beef to lower fat 
content)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> A serving of meat is 75 grams (1/2 cup). Meat in 
bulk packages or family-size packages may be cheaper, but always check the 
price per kilogram (or kg).</p> 
<p><strong>Poultry</strong></p> 
<p> Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> whole chickens and cutting them into serving-size pieces yourself </li> 
<li> unprocessed products (pre-basted, pre-seasoned and pre-marinated poultry 
costs more and is higher in fat and salt)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Buy poultry with skin on and bone in as it is less 
expensive. Remove the skin before serving as it is high in fat. Boil the bones 
to make soup stock.</p> 
<p><strong>Fish</strong> </p> 
<p>Save by buying&hellip; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> canned tuna, salmon and sardines, which are economical and nutritious 
</li> 
<li> frozen fish (best buys are smelts, haddock, orange roughly, ocean perch 
and Boston bluefish; fish sticks and battered fish fillets are more expensive 
and higher in fat)</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Tips!</strong> Fishing can be an inexpensive way to get fish. Make 
sure that you know which lakes and rivers are considered safe sources of fish 
by contacting the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.</p>

<h3>Top five tips for saving money while you shop</h3> 
<ol> 
<li> <strong>Shop around the edges of the store first.</strong> This is where 
you can usually find the healthy basics: vegetables and fruit, milk products, 
grain products and meats.</li> 
<li><strong> Compare bulk, &ldquo;no name&rdquo; and store-brand prices.
</strong> Pasta, rice, flour, oatmeal, dried fruit, nuts, seeds and beans may 
be better buys in bulk. Look high and low on the shelves for cheaper brands. 
End-of-aisle displays may not be the best buy. Remember to look through store 
flyers for specials.</li> 
<li> <strong>Make wise convenience-food choices.</strong> Convenience has a 
cost, whether it&rsquo;s pre-shredded cheese or oatmeal with added sugar and 
flavouring. Buy foods in their natural state as much as possible for better 
nutrition and value.</li> 
<li> <strong>Buy pre-bagged food. </strong>Produce (onions, carrots, apples, 
oranges and potatoes) and buns, rolls and bagels in bags are cheaper than 
individual items.</li> 
<li><strong>Buy fresh and store it right.</strong> Spoiled food is wasted 
money. Buy the freshest foods &ndash; check the &ldquo;best before&rdquo; 
dates. Buy an amount that can reasonably be consumed before it spoils. Store 
foods properly at home. For more information, see Section Seven: Safe Food 
Handling.</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Save A LOT by making your own baked goods and &ldquo;treats.&rdquo; 
</strong></p> 
<p>Processed baked goods, individually packaged snacks and higher-fat snacks 
do not offer good value. Instead of buying them, where appropriate, involve 
children and youth in making treats they can enjoy in smaller amounts from time 
to time, such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Date squares </li> 
<li> Bread pudding </li> 
<li> Carrot, banana or zucchini muffins</li> 
<li> Air-popped popcorn </li> 
<li>Trail mix (e.g., pretzels, dried cereal, seeds, dried fruit) </li> 
<li>Oatmeal raisin or peanut butter cookies</li> </ul>

<h3>Community food programs that may help with budget-wise healthy food choices
</h3> 
<p>Consult the local public health unit to find out if these programs or 
similar ones are available or if it is possible to start one. They can help 
stretch food dollars and may make sense in some settings as part of youth 
programming.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> <strong>The Good Food Box program </strong>is a non-profit program that 
distributes high quality fresh fruit and vegetables at various locations across 
the province, at a low cost. The cost savings of buying directly from the 
farmer or Ontario Food Terminal (as opposed to grocery stores) is passed on to 
the customers.</li> 
<li> <strong>A collective kitchen</strong> is a small group of people who meet 
to plan, budget and shop, then cook meals together. This is a great way for 
youth to learn about cooking.</li> 
<li> <strong>In a community garden,</strong> people get together to grow 
vegetables and herbs on shared land.</li> 
<li> <strong>The Community Food Advisor program</strong> offers demonstrations 
in cooking, safe food handling practices, shopping on a budget and more.</li> 
<li> <strong>Food co-operatives and buying clubs</strong> can buy directly 
from a wholesaler to save money.</li> 
<li> <strong>Farmers&rsquo; markets</strong> offer locally grown produce in 
season, usually available at reasonable prices.</li> </ol>

<h2>Section Seven Safe Food Handling</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p> 
<p>All foods, including fruit and vegetables, have the potential to cause 
illness. In fact, even foods that look, smell and taste okay can have the 
potential to cause illness. Young children are especially at risk for serious 
health problems from food poisoning.</p> 
<p>The tips provided here are simple, basic approaches. They do not replace 
the responsibility of a licensed residential setting for meeting requirements 
of any legislation that is applicable, for example, the<em>Health Protection 
and Promotion Act</em>. </p> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Four steps for safe food handling </li> 
<li> When in doubt, throw it out!</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Four steps for safe food handling</h3> 
<p>These simple steps will help reduce the risk of illness related to food. 
Contact the local public health department for more information about regulated 
food handling, hygiene and food safety practices.</p> 
<p><strong>Clean </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Anything that touches food, including hands, is a source of bacteria that 
could make someone ill. Wash hands and surfaces often.</li> 
<li> Wash hands, utensils and surfaces with hot, soapy water before, during 
and after food preparation.</li> 
<li>Sanitize countertops, cutting boards and utensils with a mild solution of 
bleach and water.*</li> 
<li> Thoroughly wash all vegetables and fruit with water &ndash; even 
&ldquo;pre-washed&rdquo; prepared vegetables &ndash; before eating and cooking.
</li> 
<li> Regularly wash dishcloths and towels with hot, soapy water. <br>
<em>* 
Mild bleach and water solution:</em> 
<ul> 
<li> Add 2 tbsp bleach to a sink full of water (4&frac12; litres)</li> 
<li> Soak cutting boards for at least one minute </li> 
<li> Do not rinse</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Separate </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Keep raw meats and poultry away from other foods during storage and 
preparation.</li> 
<li> Store ready-to-eat foods above raw foods to prevent cross-contamination. 
</li> 
<li> If possible, keep separate cutting boards for raw meats and vegetables. 
</li> 
<li> Always keep food covered and wrapped so that juices don&rsquo;t drip onto 
other foods in the fridge.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Cook</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Cook food thoroughly. Cooking times and temperatures vary for different 
meats and poultry. Look up proper cooking times in the brochure&ldquo;Food 
Safety At Home &ndash; Your Guide to Safe Handling.&rdquo; </li> 
<li> Prepare foods quickly and serve immediately so foods don&rsquo;t linger 
at room temperature and grow bacteria.</li> 
<li>Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. </li> 
<li> Don&rsquo;t reheat leftovers more than once.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Chill</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> After shopping or cooking, refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared 
foods and leftovers within two hours.</li> 
<li> Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator &ndash; never on the counter. </li> 
<li>Make sure the refrigerator is set at a temperature of 4 degrees C or 40 
degrees F, and keep the freezer at -18 C (0 F).</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>When in doubt, throw it out!</h3> 
<p>If a food looks or smells strange or different than it should, don&rsquo;t 
taste it &ndash; just toss it out.</p> 
<p>Follow these simple tips for food storage: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Read labels to determine how to store foods. Check for &ldquo;best 
before&rdquo; dates &ndash; if the date has passed, throw it out.</li> 
<li> Write the purchase date on products that will be stored for a long period 
of time (e.g., cans or frozen foods) so they can be used within proper storage 
times.</li> 
<li> Rotate food so that older products are used first. </li> 
<li> Keep open packages of dry products (cereal, flour, sugar) in airtight 
containers or plastic food storage bags.</li> </ul>

Health Association, 2004, and Canadian Partnership for Consumer Food and Safety 
Education</em></p> 
<p><strong>Good to Know</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Use leftovers before they spoil. </strong></p> 
<p>As a rule of thumb, as long as leftovers have been refrigerated within two 
hours of cooking time and stored properly, they can be eaten (within a day or 
two).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Use leftover rice in soups, fried rice or rice pudding </li> 
<li> Use ripe fruit in smoothies, fruit crisps or muffins </li> 
<li> Make a stir-fry, soup or wrap with leftover meats </li> 
<li> Use leftover plain spaghetti as a salad base the next day </li> 
<li> Use leftover veggies for quiche, pasta sauce or pizza toppings or in soup
</li> </ul>

<h2>Section Eight <br>
 Cooking with Children and Youth</h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p> 
<p>Involving children and youth in cooking at licensed residential settings 
can encourage healthy eating and good group communication. Teaching children 
and youth to prepare their own food also gives them a sense of accomplishment, 
which can boost their self-esteem. Where possible, all children and youth, 
regardless of their level of functioning, should be supported and provided with 
opportunities to participate in food preparation.</p> 
<p>Although it is not possible in every situation, having children and youth 
assist in all aspects of food preparation &ndash; planning, shopping, cooking 
and cleaning up &ndash; helps teach life skills including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Budgeting and money management (shopping, comparing food prices) </li> 
<li> Math and language skills (measuring, counting, reading recipes)</li> 
<li> Responsibility </li> 
<li> Safety and cleanliness </li> 
<li> Social skills (working together) </li> </ul> 
<p>Cooking with children and youth offers other benefits as well:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Meals get to the table more quickly </li> 
<li> Children and youth are more likely to eat what they helped plan and 
prepare</li> 
<li> Cooking can encourage children and youth to eat more vegetables and fruit 
and try new foods and recipes</li> 
<li> More people sharing in the tasks of meal preparation may reduce the need 
for expensive convenience foods</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>In this section you will find: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Tips for success </li> 
<li> Simple food-related activities</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3><strong></strong>Tips for success</h3> 
<p> Before cooking, teach children and youth the rules of the kitchen, and 
which tools and equipment they can use and which ones are off-limits. Show them 
how to safely use any kitchen tools, and tell them what to do in case of an 
emergency, such as a fire, or if they are injured (burned or cut).</p> 
<p>Here are a few simple tips to help things run smoothly: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Keep recipes simple and have appropriate supervision in place </li> 
<li> Let the children and youth do as much as they can </li> 
<li> Make it fun so they will want to keep on cooking</li> 
<li> Talk about the food while cooking &ndash; it is a great opportunity to 
explore new foods and learn healthy eating tips</li> 
<li> Expect a little mess &ndash; and ask the children and youth to help clean 
up</li> 
<li> Don&rsquo;t expect things to turn out perfectly &ndash; that&rsquo;s part 
of the learning process, and their skills will improve with time and practice
</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<h3>Food-related activities </h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong> Fun ideas</strong> These can encourage children and youth to 
enjoy healthy foods and try new foods:
<ul> 
<li> <strong>World food tour</strong> Celebrate the various cultures of the 
children and youth with a &ldquo;world food tour.&rdquo; Once a week or month, 
with the help of the children and youth, create a healthy dish from a different 
culture. Keep a record of the recipes in a booklet that each child and youth 
can keep. For recipe ideas, consult<em>The Kids&rsquo; Multicultural Cookbook: 
Food &amp; Fun Around The World</em>by Deanna F. Cook, 1995.</li> 
<li> Field trips If appropriate, go on a trip to the local farmers&rsquo; 
market. Have children and youth pick out one new ingredient and search online 
or in a cookbook for a healthy recipe that uses that ingredient.</li> </ul> 
</li> 
<li> <strong>Read about it </strong>There are many fun and educational books 
that explore food. Ask a librarian for suggestions.</li>

children and youth can explore, visit:
