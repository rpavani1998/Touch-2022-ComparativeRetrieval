<h1>Healthy Food Preparation </h1> 
<h2>Simple Conversions</h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Stir Fry</strong> (less oil, more taste) </p> 
<p>frying pan, skillet, or wok (about 350 - 375) </p> 
<p>Use a high heat oil (2-3T) toss in your chopped veges, hardest vege first, 
and keep them moving in the hot oil, every 2 minutes, add the next vege type, 
in order of hard to soft until all the veges are added. You can intermittently 
add the spices you like, a splash of sauce or seasoning, and always remember 
Real Salt or Celtic Salt and Freshly Ground Pepper. (Sesame oil and a good cold 
pressed wok oil work nicely as well)</p> 
<p>Adding fresh ginger to stir fry helps digestion, garlic and onions are also 
very healthy additions!</p> 
<p>A stir fry sauce can be as simple as a low heat combination of Braggs 
Aminos or organic soy sauce with ginger, garlic, maybe a dash of fish sauce or 
chili sauce, a touch of stevia, and if you like it thick add a bit of arrowroot 
powder (usually used to thicken fruit, and found in every seasoning aisle).</p> 
<p>This is great served over Basmati Rice (make it with 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 
water and a dollop or 2 of coconut oil).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Bake</strong>/<strong>Lower Heat Broil </strong>(less oil, more 
taste)</p> 
<p>Rub 1/4 - 1/2 inch sliced vegetables in Avocado Oil and sprinkle with your 
favorite spices - turn 1/2 way through (time determined by vege) - sweet, gold 
and red potatoes are great this way, as is egg plant, carrots, root veges, 
onion, green beans, just about anything.</p> 
<p>This is great served with broiled or baked fish - easy bake is to dip fish 
in lemon water/soy milk, coconut milk, or egg mixture, and then dip in a 50/50 
combination of Panko (japanese bread crumbs) and shredded coconut, and bake on 
a tray at 425 for about 20 minutes.</p> 
<p><strong>Steam </strong>(much healthier than boiling) </p> 
<p>Steaming is a fantastic way to slightly or evenly cook food without losing 
all of the plant energy, taste, and nutrition. If you don't have a steamer, you 
can use a pot, add a wire colander, fill with water to the bottom of the 
colander, toss in veges (hardest at bottom), bring to a boil (add Real Salt, 
Celtic Salt), cover with a lid, turn to simmer and let go for 8-15 minutes 
depending on quantity and hardness.</p> 
<p>A simple sauce can be to whisk olive or avocado oil into fresh lemon juice 
and once emulsified, add vege broth and spices - YUM-O.</p> 
<p>This is great served over Basmati Rice (make it with 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 
water and a dollop or 2 of coconut oil).</p> 
<p><strong>Pasta</strong> (with veges - a much healthier alternative) </p> 
<p>Prepare fresh or dry pasta in the usual way, however, add lots of 
vegetables in the last few minutes (fresh broccoli for example, 3 minutes 
before pasta is ready, however, organic frozen, only 1 minute before pasta is 
ready). Separately you can add cherry tomatoes to your colander and when you 
drain the pasta and veges the hot water will just be enough to make those 
tomatoes pop in your mouth, bringing fresh and alive color to any pasta dish.
</p> 
<p>In a separate bowl toss fresh baby spinach with lemon juice, olive oil with 
ground salt and pepper, dress the plate and put the pasta on top.</p> 
<p>A great italian sauce done alkalarian: </p> 
<p>Add olive oil, garlic and onion until onions run clear, then add, oregano, 
basil, peppers, (etc., to a skillet just as you would start a traditional 
marinara, minus tomatoes). In the end add a cup or more of vege broth, let it 
get hot and toss in lots and lots of diced tomatoes with ground salt and pepper 
- serve immediately!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Fusion Food </strong></p> 
<p>Eating a raw with cooked, or layering raw with cooked is a great way to 
increase vegetable enzymes and help your digestion. Adding ginger, garlic, and 
herbs, is a great health addition. Chewing more and helping your digestion is a 
definite plus when it comes to eating healthier!</p>
