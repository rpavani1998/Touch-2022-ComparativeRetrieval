</li> </ul>  'The idea that we simply cut consumption by X 
number of calories isn't leading to the expected benefits.' Photograph: Robert 
Llewelyn/Getty Images<br>

<p>I'm not surprised to read the latest news that there has been an 
overstatement on how long it will take people to lose weight. Anyone who has 
tried even one diet will be familiar with the dieters' plateau. And simply 
cutting back on calories won't work in the long term because the body willslow 
its metabolic rate. This has been suspected for some time, so why we are still 
applauding television programmes like The Biggest Loser, where people lose 
large amounts of weight each week? This show has come in forcriticism in the 
past because of its unrealistic portrayal of weight loss and such unrealistic 
expectations just create anxiety.</p> 
<p>You're following all the rules, giving it your all and yet the scales turn 
round and blow a raspberry at you. Your heart sinks, you feel the shame and 
disappointment rising and you look in the mirror to start on the blame and 
recriminations.</p> 
<p>&quot;If I'd just shut my gaping gob, all would be OK.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I shouldn't have blown off that Zumba class to go out with my 
friends.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm such a useless failure.&quot;</p> 
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, I'd like you to ask yourself a few 
questions. How useful is all this self-blame? Does it make you feel good about 
yourself? Do you feel confident and happy? And wasn't feeling confident and 
happy one of the main reasons you wanted to lose weight in the first place?</p> 
<p>This fear of a fat planet is just feeding stress and I think just making the
problem worse.</p> 
<p>Continually beating ourselves up because we don't fit in with official 
guidelines isn't doing us any good. Instead we think: &quot;I'm obviously not 
losing this weight as I should, so I may as well give in and stuff my 
face.&quot; When we can't live up to our expectations we are more likely to 
engage in behaviour that can lead to poor health &ndash; eating large amounts 
of junk food in a short space of time.</p> 
<p>In fact, I think the whole weight-centred approach to health is extremely 
unhelpful. It stigmatises people who don't fit into the &quot;acceptable&quot; 
range, regardless of whether these people are healthy or not. To hold weight 
loss up as the path to health can bedangerous.</p> 
<p>Instead of demonising people for being fat we should start focussing 
instead on health.Linda Bacon and Lucy Aphramor have done some great work in 
this area and I'd love to see more health professionals take this approach. We 
may see a reduction in obesity rates, we may not &ndash; but isn't it the 
obesity-related illnesses we really want to reduce, rather than simply berating 
people because their bodies don't fit in with guidelines, which are currently 
in doubt?</p> 
<p>We cannot continue to take a one-size-fits-all approach to health. The idea 
that we simply cut consumption by X number of calories isn't leading to the 
expected benefits. Could it be possible that we don't know precisely what 
causes the body to lose weight and maintain that loss? One day, perhaps, we 
will, but in the meantime do we really want to sacrifice our health in order to 
pursue a goal of weight loss that may well be a blind alley?</p> 
<p>If someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going 
to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not 
achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings &ndash; 
blood pressure and cholesterol for instance &ndash;are within a healthy range.
</p> 
<p>So please, let's stop putting the emphasis on the numbers on the scales and 
start using other measurements for health. Were we to do this I would expect to 
see more healthy and happy people on this planet. I'm sure that's something 
everyone would agree is a worthwhile pursuit.</p>

<p>I think the author has a point.<br>
Look at all those professional rugby 
players and to some extent heavyweight boxers. Many of them would be deemed 
unhealthily overweight, but they are far fitter than (most) of the rest of us!
<br>Being fit and healthy isn't all about weight for height and age.</p> </li>

<p>Here's where BMI falls down. Heavily muscled individuals will be 
considerably heavier due to the density of muscle tissue. However the majority 
of people don't fall into this category so it's still useful for them.<br>
The 
author seems to be making light of an explosion of obesity related diseases 
like type 2 diabetes which will have major cost implications for the NHS in the 
future. She shouldn't.</p> </li>

<p>We do, or at least those of us with any sense do. When the doc pointed out 
that my weight was leading to hypertension and a couple of other unwanted side 
effects, I decided to lose 20 pounds. I'm still living with a BMI a few points 
(ahem) north of 22, but I'm fine with that - unless it causes problems, in 
which case I would take action again.</p> </li>

lifestyle change work.</p>

<p>Too simplistic, your weight, when used, not in isolation but in context 
with a range of other measures can be helpful to understand what is happening.

<p>Some sense here.</p> 
<p>I am 50. I cycle to work and back every day 25 mile round trip. Average 
speed 16 MPH. I also play on the wing in Vets Rugby. Training once a week, game 
every other week more or less. I am 5'9 weigh 12st 5lb. Wear Have a size 30' 
waist 16 Collar. And according to BMI. I am overweight. Seriously Silly.</p> 
<p>Having said that there are an awful lot of lazy people out there. Forget 
diets to lose weight. If you aren't disabled (and sometimes even if you are) 
exercise is the only way to go and then eat normally. Or even a lot if you like 
and are burning the calories. There's no point weighing less, feeling hungry 
and lacking energy all day and being unfit.</p> 
<p>Health should be the measure which can include weight but not weight alone.

<p>I always wanted to be thin. A few years ago I was ill and a consequence of 
that was I lost a lot of weight. As I got better the weight stayed off. I could 
get into all the smaller sized clothes I once only dreamed of. What really 
surprised me was that I just did not like being that thin - it didn't feel like 
me and I felt I looked gaunt rather than healthy. I hated the feel of being so 
thin. I've slowly put on weight and there was a point, slightly over-weight by 
some standards, where I felt 'Ah this is where I feel comfortable'. I am now 
healthy, energetic and a bit overweight. Just right for me.</p> 
<p>I think we do really need to re-learn reading our own bodies and making 
decisions about what is right for us. Feeling good is more about how we feel in 
our bodies as we go about our busy days not just how we look in the mirror. 
Having said that I generally eat very little junk food and certainly would not 
encourage others to feed children a lot of junk food.</p> </li>

<p>But most of their weight is made up of muscle, not fat.</p> 
<p>You're not seriously comparing heavweight boxers with the typical belly 
hanging over the jeans in the high street person, are you?</p> 
<p>BMI's a good rough guide for the average person - if anything, it almost 
allows too wide a range (about 2 stone for me). I could be at the top of my 
healthy BMI range and have a sizeable belly.</p> </li>

<p>I'd hazard a guess and say the basic laws of Thermodynamics may have 
something to do with it... you know - burn more calories than you consume and 
you lose weight. Consume more than you burn and you turn into a chipwreck. No

try to sell themselves to us as.</p> 
<p>We'd be a lot better off if we focussed some energy on the fact that people 
aren't able to exercise in many circumstances - long commutes, cramped offices 
in car-infested industrial estates, tiny homes with no space for an exercise 
bike, expensive gym memberships with no subsidy - all push people into a 
lifestyle of enforced idleness.</p> </li>

<p>It's the proliferation of processed food that's lead to the obesity 
epidemic. Eat fresh home cooked food without additives, make an effort to move 
on a daily basis. Pulses are cheap and healthy, delicious when spices are 
added. Buy a week's worth of fruit and veg at the Market for under a tenner. 
Enjoy and don't obsess about the dials on the scales.</p> </li>

<p>They would be classified obese according to their BMI, but not on more 
precise metrics. The BMI is a simple and pretty effective proxy for obesity but 
it does not work for certain sub-populations (for instance sporty people, with 
more muscles than the average). For the large majority, the BMI is a simple way 
to assess one's healthiness.<br>
Using rugbymen in the present context is very 
similar to mentioning genetic abnormalities. It is focusing on a particular 
unrepresentative tree and missing the rest of the forest.</p> </li>

<p>This whole article is based on overweight people losing weight and how 
demoralising it is.</p> 
<p>Noone wakes up one morning and suddenly discovers they have put on 
10kgs...it is usually takes some time to put on significant amounts of weight. 
The problem is people are unwilling to take responsibility and do something in 
these earlier stages and make the lifestyle choices to ensure they maintain a 
reasonable weight.</p> 
<p>The metabolism of most people slows down as they get older, but if they are 
too big to begin with then it will obviously harder to deal with at this time.
</p> 
<p>There are far too many attitudes saying its ok to be fat and its not really 
your fault, so you don't need to do anything about it. When you see primary 
school kids eating a couple of bags crisps and drinking fizzy drinks on the way 
to school (whilst with their mother) at 8.30am it is<b>not </b>ok and excuses 
should not be made for the behaviour of these parents. These are children who 
will grow up saying &quot;I was always a big child.....&quot;</p> 
<p>There is evidence that excess weight does contribute to various health 
conditions, so it is important from a preventative point of view to encourage 
and educate people sooner rather than later that being overweight does have 
serious quality of life issues.</p> 
<p>@wotever Rugby players and heayweight boxers usually have more muscle not 
fat and that is the reason for the extra weight - not the same and thing and 
should not be confused.</p> </li>

<p>Emphasis on a low fat diet is what's causing this obesity epidemic. People 
think that oats for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and wholemeal pasta for 
dinner is healthy but it's really, really not!<br>
People need to eat more fat, 
like avocados, olive oil, nuts and animal fats, if you're restricting fat 
intake your body is going to cling on to what it can for survival, if you eat 
nothing but carbs your body composition is going to be poor no matter how much 
weight you lose through caloric restriction, excess carbs = insulin = fat 
retention<br>
it's time we learned the truth that grains are unhealthy!<br>
And 
I'm not preaching atkins or low carb because those diets are unhealthy in the 
long run, I'm preaching whole foods, real foods, omelet for breakfast with lots 
of real butter, tuna/chicken/salmon and avocado salad for lunch with lots of 
olive oil, and a grass-fed steak with spinach for dinner or a bolognaise with 
sweet potato instead of pasta, once you find the right balance you'll realise 
that eating healthily can also be eating lush foods!<br>
your body either burns 
fat or sugar for fuel, if you eat a high fat diet your body switches to fat as 
its primary energy source, you don't get the sugar crashes and insulin 
responses that cause so much inflammation and fat retention, and your body 
begins to burn its own stored fat because it no longer needs to cling onto it 
for, what it literally believes is dear life. you start to feel great! and 
since when was fat unhealthy? being fat is unhealthy but eating fat is the 
complete opposite!</p> 
<p>Eating healthy is more important than weight loss (though weight loss 
natural occurs through healthy eating) but people need to be steered in the 
right direction, losing weight and feeling good shouldn't be a struggle, it 
should make sense! it should feel right! it should make you feel great and get 
you back to where you should be physiologically</p> 
<p>A huge part is responsibility though and far to many people lack this in 
droves</p> </li>

<p>If you make the decision or are in the habit of buying rubbish food (ready

heaps of alcohol, sweets, cakes, crips and so on), the chances are that you 
will eat/drink it.</p> 
<p>Don't torture yourself with diets or with standing on a pair of scales. 
Just do not buy rubbish food, chocolates, sweets, crisps, biscuits etc. What 
you do not buy, you cannot eat.</p> 
<p>Take responsibility over your own actions.</p> 
<p>Cook and bake from scratch, eat only 3 home cooked meals a day (modest 
portions and no pudding) and do not snack in between.</p> 
<p>Result: you will healthy, fit and lean, even when you get really elderly.

<p>There's a guy in my office, around the same age as me, who eats junk food, 
drinks loads of alcohol, does no exercise and is happily in the correct 
(&quot;healthy&quot;) BMI range for his height.</p> 
<p>I cycle to and from work every day (at speed), have a diet rich in whole 
grains, fresh fruit and vegetables, rarely drink and don't smoke, yet my BMI is 
in the overweight category. My essential problem is that although I eat 
healthily, I eat big portions.</p> 
<p>Neither of us are body-builders but looking at us and basing it purely on 
weight/BMI, you'd say I was less healthy. Having seen his lifestyle and what he 
eats and drinks, I really find that difficult to believe.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.&quot; - Michael Pollan</p> 
<p>If you take what Pollan says and add in regular exercise. you should be 
right, whatever the weight is!</p> 
<p>I also think a key point is to enjoy what you're doing. It's all well and 
good to say it's a lifestyle, but it should also be a lifestyle you enjoy. So 
find exercise that you actually like and look forward to, whether it's team 
sports, classes at a gym, jogging with a friend or solo workouts, and keep 
doing it. Same goes for food - appreciate every delicious mouthful of real 
food; food that isn't an over-processed product that your grandmother wouldn't 
recognise.</p> </li>

<p>Same. I do ten miles hill walking every day, and play football at weekends. 
But I'm still overweight. The point is that exercise is good for you in many 
ways, but is a relatively small part of losing weight. They key for most of us 
of our demographic? Booze. Cut it in half, and the pounds leave in unhappy

<p>I just remebered General Schwarzkopf. I read his Book back in the 90s. He 
was a big fellah and even as a senior officer still ran his 5 miles every day. 
Then the US Army bought in BMI and even he was told to lose weight. Well being 
a senior bloke he got antsy about it and looked into it. According to BMI the 
entire NFL and AFL was unfit for military service as were most pro basket ball 
players and baseball players. The US 100m sprint relay team were all unfit for 
military service according to BMI and it was only when you got to the middle 
and long distance athletes that they could pass.</p> 
<p>Schwarzkopf had MI removed as a measure and incorporated an objective test. 
Can you carry your kit over the distance in the time without problem. If you 
can then you are fit for military service.</p> 
<p>BMI is a silly measure and I mean for anyone. Some seriiously unfit 
unhealthy people have a good BMI and yet most sports people are classified 
overweight. And it's no good arguing that it is a useful guideline for most 
people. It is pure voodoo masquerading as a scientific measure. Do like 
Schwartkopf did and get rid of it.</p> </li>

<p>Being a bit fat is ok. Being more than a bit fat will kill you earlier than 
you might like, and make the march to the grave more of a deeply uncomfortable, 
breathless waddle. (I know. I'm a working on it fatty.)</p> 
<p>Yes, people shouldn't put themselves down, but be real - did you really 
watch the calories and were you really energetic week in, week out when the 
scales stayed the same? Thought not.</p> 
<p>Fact is, eating less and moving more does work. </p> 
<p>Healthcare professionals DO focus on health. They aren't concerned about 
BMIs, so much as BMIs in the wider context of muscle vs fat, exercise, types of 
foods eaten, quantities of foods eaten, times foods are eaten, emotional and 
mental triggers for eating, and dealing with mental and emotional health issues 
if they are at the root of overeating and resultant weight gain.</p> 
<p>Nobody tut tuts at those athletic souls with high BMIs and statuesque 
muscles.</p> 
<p>This article sounds like a miserable fat person's rant about feeling bad 
about themselves.</p> 
<p>If you don't like being fat, or miserable, try counselling and a weight 
loss group or GP approved plan with regular check ups. They work. Slowly, but 
very surely.</p> </li>

<p>The author has some good points, but I do think it is concerning how it has 
become quite normal and acceptable not only to be a bit bigger, but (in women 
at least) almost to celebrate it.</p> 
<p>After losing a few pounds myself (from a size 8-10 to just an 8, still a 
healthy BMI - whatever that means) after an illness last year I was astonished 
at how many people remarked on my weight loss in very judgemental terms. Even 
with my previous figure I had often had people call me 'skinny' or 'like a 
stick'. These are often the same people who celebrate being &quot;real 
women&quot; (an exclusive club for which it seems one must be at least a size 
12 and have plenty of 'curves').</p> 
<p>My point is, that none of these people would ever dream of commenting if I 
had gained weight instead. Often the same friends will go out of their way to 
praise the 'curvy' figures of women who are, quite frankly, overweight.</p> 
<p>I agree that we should have better measures as far as obesity is concerned, 
you cannot reduce health to numbers on the scale. But, we must surely be 
cautious about creating a culture where being overweight is normal. A lot of 
people seem to equate a desire to be slim and healthy with media-induced 
anorexia. I apologise - I realise my own experience and opinion is highly 
subjective, but this is just something I've noticed recently.</p> </li>

<p>I'm 5'2&quot; and 11st7lbs (making my BMI borderline obese). A disgusting 
slob who eats cake all day, about to die from diabetes, right?</p> 
<p>Well actually, I go powerlifting 3x a week and get some cardio on on two 
other days. I eat 1800kcal per day, usually. I am not losing any weight (nor do 
I want to). I do more exercise than my skinny friends.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>Yeah and once the sportyness stops these super fit types bloat right up as 
muscle turns to fat.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Muscle never, ever, turns to fat. What happens is that people stop 
exercising but do not reduce their calorific intake. result, more energy in and 
less energy out, so they get fat.</p> 
<p>If they remain sedentary, the muscles that used to be maintained by 
exercise will waste, so they lose muscle mass at the same time as putting down 
more fat stores. Double whammy, since muscle burns more calories than fat, so 
the process tends to accelerate.</p> 
<p>the message is, stay active. If you used to train ten hours a week and now 
exercise only 5 hours a week at lower intensity, adjust your intake to 
compensate. To do this, of course, you have to know what is in what you eat and 
drink. Most people don't.</p> </li>

<p>This is just a prediction, but here goes...</p> 
<p><b>Step 1 - An interesting, informed , balanced and thought provoking 
article</b></p> 
<p><b>Step 2 - The tidal wage of ignorant, smug, abusive comments </b>about 
how easy it is to lose weight, how people only have themselves to blame, how 
people who are heavier than the government says they should be are disgusting 
and so on.</p> 
<p>I struggle to understand why so many people seem to actively hate 
overweight people. Is it perhaps because 1) they are easy to identify visually, 
and 2) they are one of the last societal groups it is still OK to sneer at and 
feel superior?</p> 
<p>Most slim people are that way through a lucky break with their genes, not 
through their innate strength of mind or character. In other words they have 
done nothing to achieve it - its just there. In the same way, I am tall, good 
looking and very bright - none of which I had to work for.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, I am also overweight and years of following doctors advice, 
eating sensibly, (can't eat pizza, pasta, bread, cake, biscuits, sweets, 
burgers, most takeaways etc anyway - intollerant to wheat and diabetic), years 
of exercise (- a brown belt in contact karate and hundreds of miles walking the 
dog -) and I am still over weight.</p> 
<p>Many slim people, unfortunately, don't want to accept that it may be harder 
for other people to lose weight than it is for them. A little tolerance would 
go a long way...</p> </li>

<p>I think everyone going back and forth between &quot;don't eat crap&quot; 
and &quot;diets don't work&quot; are missing the main point of the article, 
which is that being overweight according to official guidelines should not be 
considered to be a moral failing. It<i>can</i> be a lot of things, from slow 
metabolism or hypothyroidism to hidden disabilities to bad habits to a serious 
case of depression, and those things can have occurred in the past, but not be 
occurring now. What it almost never is, however, is a deliberate inclination 
toward gluttony or some decadent desire to be fat. When every flapjack is a 
sin, you're automatically set up to fail.</p> </li>

<p>Meh. The BMI says I'm obese. I disagree. I sure am overweight, but I'm 
healthy. My blood pressure, liver, kidney function etc all good. I regularly 
test my blood sugar as diabetes runs in my family (and I'm afraid it hasn't 
discriminated by weight when it decided who to pick).</p> 
<p>I eat lots of fresh food &amp; vegetables. I grill my meat &amp; fish. I 
don't eat ready meals, prepared sauces etc etc etc. I do overindulge on the 
carbs (pasta especially). I enjoy treats - a takeaway occasionally, some sweets 
or a pecan plait. I don't diet because the people I see diet always seem 
miserable. I'm not miserable. I'm confident and content. I walk a lot &amp; 
ridiculously fast. I play little sport but I enjoy it despite being bad at it.
</p> 
<p>You can be slim &amp; eat crap, not exercise etc. And you can be overweight 
and still be healthy. I eat too much of my mostly healthy food, I know that. 
But if I see myself becoming bigger than I would like, then I cut down on those 
treats, up the veg, lower the pasta. I definitely am a lot healthier (and 
happier) than people slimmer than me.</p> 
<p>It's not the same case for everyone, but there are differences. We can't 
tar everyone with the same brush.</p> 
<p>And I feel slightly annoyed with myself that I even felt I had to justify 
myself at all. Especially on here, since people just love to argue regardless, 
so what I say is really inconsequential!</p> </li>

<p>I cannot recommend this advice enough. I eat over 3500 calories a day but 
because I spend an hour swimming, running or cycling 5 days a week I never put 
on weight. When I was not exercising for a couple of months due to injury I cut 
down on my calories but put on weight. We are built to run and walk almost all 
day, the fact most spend their time on the sofa is the problem not what they 
are eating.</p> </li>

<p>I find it ridiculous that so many people only consider adjusting the 
&quot;calories in&quot; side of the equation, whereas if they increased the 
&quot;calories out&quot; by increasing the amount of exercise they did it would 
ultimately end up having the same effect.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Absolutely except that increasing the calories expended side of the 
equation wouldn't have the same effect. It would have a better effect. Weight 
would be lost. Yes. And health would be improved as well. You wouldn't just 
lose weight you'd be fitter as well.</p> </li>

<p>For what it is worth (it is an old article from the Annals of Internal 
Medicine ,2000):<br>
http://www.annals.org/content/133/2/92.1.short</p> 
<p>A randomized, controlled trial was set up to look into' the effects of 
diet- or exercise-induced weight loss on the reduction of obesity and related 
comorbid condition'. The results back the 'calories out' approach.</p> 
<p>Their conclusion was </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Weight loss induced by increased daily physical activity without caloric 
restriction substantially reduces obesity (particularly abdominal obesity) and 
insulin resistance in men. Exercise without weight loss reduces abdominal fat 
and prevents further weight gain.</p> </blockquote> </li>

<p>I think when you find out how many calories are in a couple of biscuits (or 
slice of bread/banana/salad dressing) and equate that to how much exercise in 
minutes or hours (running/swimming/cycling) you'd actually have to do to burn 
it off, you understand why there's so much focus on the &quot;calories in&quot; 
side of the equation.</p> 
<p>I'm not, by any means, saying that exercise isn't essential for a healthy 
life, just that it shouldn't necessarily be linked to weight-loss.</p> 
<p>As an aside, how many women here (and I'm guessing it will be women) have 
joined an exercise or sports class for the pure enjoyment of it and been told 
that it's &quot;a great way to lose weight&quot;?</p> </li>

<p>The simplistic calories in/calories out equation is half the problem. Read 
some Gary Taubes and understand insulin resistance and it will all become much 
easier.</p> 
<p>Hint: we aren't designed to consume refined carbs at the levels we do.</p>

<p>The problem is that a lot of people do a bit of exercise, and then 'reward' 
themselves by consuming more calories. An hour in the gym will probably burn me 
about an extra 500 calories, tops. If I eat exactly the same, I'll lose a pound 
a week if I exercise every day. However what most people will do is go to say a 
not very hard class twice a week, burning say 600-800 calories and then think 
this gives them licence to pig out on what they want.</p> 
<p>To maximise weight loss you really have to do both. And be serious about 
the exercise.</p> </li>

<p>Sorry still rather incoherent in my previous post. What I'd like to say is 
that making fat people feel like pariahs in society doesn't help us to lose 
weight for all kinds of reasons. Change society's attitude to us and then you 
can help us to improve our health.</p> </li>

<p>BMI is a good general indicator but I would warn of the following pitfall a 
certain idiot man I used to know was a pro at:</p> 
<p>skinny as hell arms, legs and chest but with a big belly. The man had no 
muscle mass as he never excerised, drove everywhere. Without the belly, he 
would have been underweight. A real pregnant stick insect but his BMI showed he 
was in good weight range, so he continued . Though anyone could tell, he was 
not a healthy shape.</p> 
<p>Weight is not always a good indicator, the percentage of body fat in 
proportion to lean muscle is the key.</p> </li>

<p>I too am fed up with the current obsession about weight, obesity and the 
unreal skinny women hailed in the media as icons of beauty. I'm fitter than I 
have been since my teens because I have had a dog for three years and walk 
about 3 miles a day with him. However, I'm still a size 16 in a 5'3&quot; 
frame. I had relatives who lived to 90, 89 and 84 etc who would be considered 
obese by today's standards. I'd rather be plump and fill out the wrinkles than 
look skeletal like Demi Moore, Victoria Beckham et al. I'd also be furious if I 
lived until 90 and had denied myself chocolate!</p> </li>
