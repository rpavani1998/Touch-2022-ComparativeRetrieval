<h2>Extreme Makeover: Breakfast fry-up</h2> <br>

 &nbsp;  We take a familiar favourite and 
make it over into a healthier version.  &nbsp;  It&rsquo;s a favourite weekend 
meal; the breakfast fry-up. But did you ever stop to think about the energy and 
fat that&rsquo;s hiding in that stack of bacon? We had a play in our test 
kitchen and came up with a different &ndash; and much healthier &ndash; version 
of the fry-up just by making a few small changes. And it still tasted delicious.
 &nbsp; 
<h3><b>Traditional fry-up: </b></h3>  &nbsp; <strong>Streaky bacon:</strong>  
can be up to 1/4 fat.  &nbsp; <strong>Fried tomatoes:</strong>  cooking in fat 
adds to the kilojoule and the fat count.  &nbsp; <strong>Fried eggs:</strong>  
use butter or oil and you&rsquo;ll add still more fat.  &nbsp; <strong>Hash 
browns:</strong>  530KJ and 5.7g of fat per serving; but wait &ndash; on 
checking the pack we discover a serving is only one hash brown!  &nbsp;  Total 
KJ: 2375 (26% of daily energy)  Total fat 47g (22g saturated fat)  &nbsp; 
<h3><b>HFG version:</b></h3>  &nbsp; <strong>Dansk bacon:</strong>  has only 
3% fat and half the kilojoules. Needs careful cooking &ndash; don&rsquo;t 
overcook or it&rsquo;ll be leathery. But the taste is just as good.  &nbsp; 
<strong>Microwave eggs:</strong>  scramble or poach eggs in the microwave and 
you don&rsquo;t have to add any fat at all. For scrambled, just cook beaten egg 
in a bowl for around 2 minutes on medium, then break up with a fork. Our 
ex-chef designer tells us this is how they do it in many restaurants.  &nbsp; 
<strong>Oven-roasted tomatoes:</strong>  add these to the dish when you cook 
the potatoes and they&rsquo;ll be collapsing and sweet by the time they come 
out.  &nbsp; <strong>Oven baked cubed potatoes:</strong>  cut a potato into 1cm 
cubes and bake with a light spray of oil in a hot oven. Just as quick as 
hashbrowns and much healthier &ndash; only 0.1 grams of fat.  &nbsp;  Total KJ: 
1515 (17% of daily energy)  Total fat 16.1g (4g saturated fat)  &nbsp; <b>
