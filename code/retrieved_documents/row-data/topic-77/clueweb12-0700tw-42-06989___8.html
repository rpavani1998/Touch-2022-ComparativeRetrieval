<p>Yesterday, Renae shared the reasons that family dinners need to be a 
priority in our houses; how they effect our children, how they change our 
family dynamics, and how they influence our health. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s 
hard to argue against any of those things&hellip;&hellip;.but it doesn&rsquo;t 
erase the fact that sometimes life still just feels 
so&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..insane. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s so much easier said 
than done to throw out, &ldquo;just take some things off the 
calendar&hellip;.get home from work earlier&hellip;&hellip;plan your meals a 
month ahead of time&hellip;..drop everything you&rsquo;re doing and eat 
together.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If only it were that simple right?</p> 
<p>Most of the time I feel that what gets in the way of regular, quality, 
meaningful family dinners is the food itself. &nbsp;We have these grand plans 
of whipping up some home-made chicken cordon bleu (after all&ndash;we bought 
all the ingredients and it&rsquo;s what we have written on the meal planning 
calendar for today&ndash;we have to). &nbsp;But 
then&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.4:30 rolls 
around&hellip;&hellip;..we&rsquo;re getting home from work or starting to think 
about dinner and we&rsquo;re just not feeling chicken cordon bleu. 
&nbsp;We&rsquo;re feeling &ldquo;kids eat free night at 
Applebee&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And the week continues in this vein&hellip;.know what 
I mean?</p> 
<p>I believe there are a few main reasons that our family dinner plans get 
derailed because of food&ndash;and we&rsquo;re to blame&hellip;&hellip;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We set our sights way too high in regards to what we can reasonably make 
during the week.</li> 
<li>We fool ourselves into thinking that we can completely wipe out the need 
to ever go out during the week or order a pizza.</li> 
<li>We watch a lot of the Food Network.</li> </ul> 
<p>And believe me&ndash;I love Giada for the serenity that is her kitchen as 
much as the next girl&ndash;but I need to be honest about the fact that 
it&rsquo;s never going to be like that while I&rsquo;m cooking in my own 
kitchen. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t let those expectations and the fact that they 
won&rsquo;t come true derail my dinner at home plans.</p> 
<p>So I want to share with you some practical, so easy, dinner ideas that you 
can reasonably do a couple times a week and sit down together for a great half 
n hour around the table.</p> 
<p>********************</p> 
<p><strong>Main Courses</strong>:</p> 
<p>Last year we featured two different recipes that would work well for easy 
family dinners. &nbsp;They use everyday ingredients, kids love them, they are 
easy to make ahead and freeze, and they generate left-overs; all necessary when 
you&rsquo;re coming up with easy dinner ideas. &nbsp;You can follow these links 
to get the recipes:</p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Hamburger Surprise</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Potato Chowder</p> 
<p>3. Another easy main dish idea that was a staple in our kitchen growing up 
was Pork Chops &amp; Rice. &nbsp;Simply brown four or five bone in chops in a 
pan, transfer to a greased baking dish and add one box of Uncle Ben&rsquo;s 
original wild rice mix with the herb packet (don&rsquo;t use the quick cook 
rice). &nbsp;Pour two cups of water into the dish and bake covered for one hour 
at 350 degrees. &nbsp;Serve with some applesauce and you&rsquo;ve got something 
different and easy.</p> 
<p>4. &nbsp;My grandma made home-made tortellini&ndash;I don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;I 
buy the frozen beef tortellini and add it to about 8 cups of boiling chicken 
broth. &nbsp;Cook until they rise to the top and serve as a soup; top with some 
grated parmesan cheese. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s delicious and filling and your kids 
will beg for more. &nbsp;My two year old cries when this is all gone.</p> 
<p><strong>Side Dishes:</strong></p> 
<p>Sides stress me out. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m always &nbsp;scrounging around trying 
to find something more creative than a tube of crescent rolls. &nbsp;I got over 
the &ldquo;sides need to be home-made too&rdquo; mental battle a while ago. 
&nbsp;It&rsquo;s freeing&ndash;join me will you?</p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Alexia Sweet Potato Fries&hellip;..These are delicious as are all 
Alexia products and they can be found in the frozen food aisle of most grocery 
stores. &nbsp;They make a great side to chicken or steak. &nbsp;You can bake 
some broccoli or cauliflower on the same tray and have a vegetable medley blend 
that will be a hit!</p> 
<p>2. &nbsp;Bob Evan&rsquo;s pre-made mashed potatoes. &nbsp;I was skeptical 
of these too&ndash;but they are great. &nbsp;They are creamy and you simply zap 
them in the microwave. &nbsp;They have a great little herby taste to them as 
well that makes people think you did something extra special to them.</p> 
<p>3. &nbsp;Cherry Tomato Crisp&hellip;&hellip;This is another recipe we 
featured a while back and is great for incorporating something healthy into 
your meal. &nbsp;If you paired this with a rotisserie chicken from the grocery 
store you&rsquo;d have one gourmet looking meal. &nbsp;And if getting out a 
food processor gives you hives you can also use ready-made bread crumbs and 
flavor them.</p> 
<p>4. &nbsp;And my personal favorite&hellip;&hellip;blister potatoes. 
&nbsp;Wash a few potatoes, slice them in 1/4 inch thick rounds (skin included) 
and place them right on your oven rack.&nbsp; Bake them at 350 degrees for 
about 45-50 minutes and watch them blister up as they bake.&nbsp; Grab them off 
the racks with tongs, srpinkle them with salt and a little butter, and serve 
with ketchup.&nbsp; These are a great side to acompany hamburgers, grilled 
chicken, or steak&ndash;and they&rsquo;re a lot healthier than chips or french 
fries.</p> 
<p>These ideas are simple and I&rsquo;m sure you have a million more.&nbsp; I 
would encourage you to make a list of all your simple dinner ideas and make 
that your go-to resource instead of biting off more than you can chew when it 
comes to making dinner and delusions of grandeur.&nbsp; I love 
cooking&ndash;love it.&nbsp; And I love trying new recipes that are complicated 
and in-depth.&nbsp; But I try and reserve those for Saturday or Sunday 
nights&ndash;when my day has been relatively peaceful and I feel up to the 
challenge.&nbsp; If you can get yourself in that mind-set about food 
preparation my guess is that you&rsquo;ll feel a lot more relaxed and 
successful when it comes to making dinner around the table a priority.</p>
