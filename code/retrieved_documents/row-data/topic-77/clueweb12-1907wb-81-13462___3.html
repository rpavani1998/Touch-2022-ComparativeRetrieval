<p>You bet! These skinny fries are a fabulously healthy alternative to regular 
French fries. You&rsquo;ll only need 4 ingredients to create them. So simple, 
once the potatoes are prepped.&nbsp; All you do is drizzle with olive oil, 
sprinkle with seasoning salt and pepper, toss, bake and dig in.<strong>One 
serving of these yummy, skinny fries has 110 calories, 3.5 grams of fat and<em>
3 Weight Watchers POINTS PLUS.</em> A small Mc Donald&rsquo;s fries has 230 
calories and 11 grams of fat.</strong></p> 
<p>Prep Time: 15 minutes<br>
 Bake Time: 40 minutes</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Ingredients</strong></p> 
<p>2 large baking potatoes, (Russet potatoes) 8 ounces each</p> 
<p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p> 
<p>1 teaspoons Lawry&rsquo;s seasoning salt, see shopping tip</p> 
<p>Fresh ground pepper, to taste</p> 
<p>Olive oil cooking spray</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Instructions</strong></p> 
<p>1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</p> 
<p>2. Scrub the potatoes and cut lengthwise into 4 equal slices; cut each 
slice into thirds or fourths. As the potatoes are cut, place them in a dish of 
ice water and let soak for about 10 minutes</p> 
<p>3. After soaking potatoes, drain off water, remove potatoes and pat dry 
with paper towels. Return the dried potatoes to bowl, sprinkle with seasoning 
salt and pepper and drizzle with oil; evenly distribute the oil and seasoning 
by tossing with your hands.&nbsp; Mix well.</p> 
<p>4. Place potatoes on a baking sheet that has been coated with nonstick 
cooking spray.&nbsp; Spray top of potatoes with a little more cooking 
spray.&nbsp; Bake until golden brown and tender; approximately 35-40 minutes, 
turning frequently.&nbsp; If you like crispy fries, bake an additional 8-10 
minutes.</p> 
<p>5. Sprinkle with additional seasoning and pepper, if desired, and serve.</p>
<p>Makes 4 servings</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Food Fact</strong><br>
 The russet potato is low in moisture 
and high in starch, making it good for baking, boiling and making French 
fries.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re sometimes referred to as an old potato or a baking 
potato.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Healthy Benefit</strong><br>
 Potatoes have surprising health 
benefits.&nbsp; No need to keep them out of your diet.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;re rich in complex carbohydrates that can supply energy.&nbsp; They 
are low in calories and contain no fat.&nbsp; They contain more potassium than 
any other fresh vegetable, even more than bananas!&nbsp; Potatoes also contain 
vitamins C and B6.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Shopping Tip</strong><br>
 Choose potatoes that are firm and 
plump, avoiding those that have shriveled skins, sprouting eyes, soft spots, 
blemishes and green spots.</p> 
<p>Most supermarkets sell Lawry&rsquo;s seasoning salt in the spice section or 
use your favorite. Just salt or salt and pepper taste great too.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Prep Tip</strong><br>
 Soaking the potatoes first in ice 
water reduces some of the starch and helps the potatoes from sticking during 
baking.&nbsp; In addition, the potatoes won&rsquo;t turn brown.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 Serving Tip</strong><br>
 These skinny fries taste great 
dipped in ketchup, barbecue sauce or my recipe for Nancy&rsquo;s Skinny Ranch 
Dressing.</p>

<p>Cant really go wrong with a simply yet healthier batch of fries! I love 
fries myself but really cut back on eating on the fried ones over the last few 
years especially so this baked version is up my alley </p> </li>

<p>I love making chips like this. I think I even prefer them to the greasy 
take-away version. Yum!</p> </li>

<p>Yummy recipe! I used grapeseed oil instead of olive and it was still very 
good!<br>
 Be careful if you cut the recipe in half, to not bake it as long as 
they will burn&hellip;.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m so happy you liked this recipe. I&rsquo;ve never tried it with 
grapeseed oil but sounds like it would taste great&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>Could you give us an approximate weight for the two large potatoes? I ask 
because I&rsquo;ve found that a &ldquo;large&rdquo; potato means different 
things to different people I buy bags of potatoes and usually go for smaller 
ones so pounds are helpful when trying to ensure I&rsquo;m making enough.</p> 
<p>Thanks. I love all the recipes!</p> </li>

<p>Hi Kristi, I did my calculations based on one potato weighing about 8 
ounces each. An 8 ounce potato has about 178 calories.<br>
 I hope this helps. 
I&rsquo;m so happy you are enjoying my recipes. Thanks!</p> </li> </ol>
