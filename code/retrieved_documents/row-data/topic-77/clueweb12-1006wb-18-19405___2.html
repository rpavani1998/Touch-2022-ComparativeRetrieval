<p>Your kids love french fries. You want to see your kids eating foods that 
are good for them. Why not try baked sweet potato fries? Sweet potatoes are 
loaded with Vitamins C, beta-carotene, manganese, potassium and fiber.
&nbsp;Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Clean a few sweet potatoes 
with a vegetable scrubber (leave the skin on) and slice the potatoes into 
french fry strips the size of your choosing. Spread out the fries on a 
foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with 1 &ndash; 2 tbsp olive oil. Season 
with a sprinkle of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake the fries until 
golden brown and crisp. 3-5 potatoes may take between 35-45 minutes. You can 
serve these fries plain or with non-fat or low-fat plain Greek yogurt and a 
little lemon juice as a dip!</p>
