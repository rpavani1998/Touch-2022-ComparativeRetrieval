<p><strong>FOOD INTOLERANCE NETWORK FACTSHEET</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Healthy </strong><strong>choice</strong><strong> c</strong><strong>
anteens/tuckshops</strong><strong></strong></p>  Many teachers and parents are 
disappointed by 'healthy' foods in sold in canteens under the anti-obesity 
guidelines for Australian schools.  As one mother commented: <em> 'Low salt, 
low sugar, low fat and let's give them every other bit of sh*t we can find to 
give it taste. Missed the point I'd say'.</em> 
<p>From our point of view, canteens can't call themselves 'healthy' until they 
adopt 'low additive' guidelines as well. Trials have shown that students do 
better when they eat low additive food and the Federal Government lists 
additives most likely to be a problem in school lunches on page 43 of its
National Healthy School Canteens Guidelines (oh, and by the way, it's a mistake 
that artificial colour 133 brilliant blue doesn't appear on this list, this 
additive is just as bad as the other artificial colours).</p> 
<p><strong>How to avoid artificial colours</strong></p> 
<p>FIN members tell us that artificial colours still appear in 'healthy' 
canteens in products such as ice tubes, slushies, icypoles, Zooper Doopers, 
strawberry milk, yoghurt-based snacks, licorice twists, jellies, sprinkles, 
pickles, sausage rolls, pies and hot dogs.</p> 
<p>In one school, artificial colours were found in the following products</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<ul> 
<li>Hotdog 110</li> 
<li>Zooper Doopers 102, 110, 122, 123, 133</li> 
<li>Slushi tropical 110</li> 
<li>Slushi raspberry 122</li> 
<li>Slushi Blue 133</li> 
<li>Quench 110, 133</li> 
<li>Portello 122, 102</li> 
<li>Lemon Lime 102, 110</li> 
<li>Lemon Crush 102</li> 
<li>Strawberry Milk 124</li> 
<li>Juice Cruncher 102</li> 
<li>Wonka twist 129</li> 
<li>Aussie Glucose 102, 104, 110, 122, 124, 133</li> 
<li>Yoghurt Vita Bite 102, 110, 133</li> 
<li>Zooper Doopers 123, 133</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> insist on finding alternative products - they 
are available!</p> 
<p><strong>Chicken nuggets</strong></p> 
<p>Remember what Jamie Oliver said about chicken nuggets in Jamie's School 
Dinners? Well, here's what one failsafer found in her new, 'healthy' school 
canteen - chicken nuggets with the following ingredients:</p> 
<p>chicken (51%), flours (wheat, rice, maize), potato flakes (potato, 
emulsifier (471)), isolate soy protein, acidity regulator (330,450), 
preservative (220), salt, water, acidity regulator (450,500,451), stabiliser 
(481,1404,471,412,415), Vegetable oil, gluten, maltodextin, egg albumen, 
dextrose, firming agent (509), cereal starches (tapioca, potato, wheat), 
hydrolysed vegetable protein, colour (100, 160c), dehydrated vegetables, herbs 
&amp; spices, flavour (wheat, lactose) antioxidant (320) emulsifier (900).</p> 
<p>In amongst all those numbers are two nasty additives (sulphur dioxide 220 
'the asthma additive' and antioxidant 320) as well as glutamate-containing 
ingredient Hydrolysed Vegetable Protein (this is the same as MSG). Most chicken 
nugget type products will contain some kind of glutamate containing 
ingredients, perhaps yeast extract or hydrolysed 
vegetable/wheat/plant/maize/rice protein, and some food activitsts suspect that 
MSG-type flavour enhancers can be hidden in 'spices' or 'spice extracts' or 
'flavours'</p> 
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> See our recipe below for homemade 
additive-free chicken nuggets. To meet low fat, low salt guidelines if needed 
you can reduce the portion size, which is what the manufacturers have done.</p> 
<p><strong>Additives linked to children's behaviour and attention problems
</strong></p> <strong>COLOURS</strong> <br>
102 tartrazine, 104 quinoline

flavour is safest<br>
&nbsp; 
<p><strong>How to reduce additives in your school - suggestion from 4 schools
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1. Hills CC school in Adelaide.</strong> Our Adelaide contact 
Bronwyn Pollnitz recently organised a highly successful additive free trial in 
this school and several others.</p> 
<p>Bronwyn says:</p> 
<p><em>Kids in schools don't mind cutting our colours - who cares what colour 
it is - or preservatives. They don't care if the food lasts one day or a one 
year - they just want to eat it NOW! Flavour is harder - the canteen manager is 
likely to say 'but this is the brand the kids chose!'</em></p> 
<p><em>When I talk to classes I always bring in dips and fresh vegies for them 
to try, to really make a point that proper fresh real food doesn't need extra 
flavour added to make it taste good. They particularly like the green dip. It 
really is about providing very palatable alternatives to things like flavoured 
chips, biscuits, noodles etc.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Bronwyn's Green Dip Recipe</strong></p> 1 small crushed clove of 
garlic<br>
4 spring onions (or 2 + small amount of parsley) <br>
250g cream 
cheese<br>
2-4 teaspoons water <br>

<p>Place garlic and spring onions (+ parsley if using) in food processer and 
mince. Add cream cheese and water and mix until the desired consistency is 
achieved. Add more water if needed. Ensure no lumps of cheese are left.</p>

<p><strong>2. Wolney Junior School:</strong> A junior school in the UK which 
has leapt up the league tables attributes some of its success to a ban on 
crisps and fizzy drinks at the tuck shop. Pupils at Wolney Junior school in New 
Addington, South London, now consume two boxes of apples, two of bananas and 
two crates of satsumas every week. The success rate for 11 year olds has almost 
trebled since the ban on unhealthy snacks two years ago. The ban was brought in 
because of fears that artificial additives including flavourings, sweeteners 
and preservatives, made children hyperactive and more difficult to teach. 
Wolney Junior which won praise as one of the most improved schools in Greater 
London, claims that concentration levels shot up and behaviour improved when 
tuck shop &quot;junk&quot; was axed from morning break.</p> 
<p>Peter Winder, the head teacher, said &quot;we were very concerned that the 
crisps and fizzy drinks had all the E-additives. One of our teachers asked if 
it was possible to trial the sale of fruit in just one year group&quot;. The 
trial in 1996, had immediate results. &quot;All the teachers in the year group 
noticed a difference in behaviour and concentration.&quot;</p> 
<p>The old tuck shop was scrapped in 1997. Two years on, the school was the 
34th most improved school in the country. Its Key Stage Two test results in 
English, which were less than half the national average in 1996 with 23 per 
cent of pupils achieving expected levels, leapt to a 64% rate last year.</p> 
<p>See a report of low additive schools around the world</p> 
<p><strong>3. Palmers Island Primary School:</strong> In 2005 a small school 
in Northern NSW asked us to help them with a two week additive free trial so we 
took a professional camera crew with us. Before the trial, we spent a day at 
the school talking to 120 students, staff and parents about the effects of 
nasty food additives and teaching them how to read labels. During the trial the 
students were offered additive free breakfasts at no cost, encouraged to have 
bottles of water on their desks, and asked to eat additive free foods at school 
and at home. A few families who had been thinking about doing the full 
elimination diet took the opportunity to do it and felt much more supported 
than usually happens.</p> 
<p>About 70-80 per cent of children joined the trial, and everyone noticed a 
difference &ndash; quieter, calmer, less yelling in class, concentrating 
better, nicer to each other, less annoying, naughty children less naughty 
&ndash; and no headaches, stomach aches or skin rashes. After the trial, the 
children were allowed to buy a treat, and the camera caught what some experts 
claim doesn't happen &ndash; the children became loud, cheeky, annoying, fought 
with each other again. We've already shown the Palmers Island clip to 
schoolteachers and 2000 schoolchildren from over 25 schools. It's part of our 
DVD launched in 2006. Based on Sue Dengate's 'Fed Up with Children's Behaviour' 
presentation and filmed in various locations over six months, the DVD includes 
revealing interviews with parents and children from Cairns to Gippsland 
illustrating the many aspects of food intolerance. See viewers' feedback under

<p><strong>RECIPES</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Halliwell Chicken Nuggets</strong> - these nuggets are 
additive-free and kids love them.</p> 500 g chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 
nugget shapes (easier to do when chicken is half frozen)<br>
1 clove garlic, 
crushed<br>
sea salt to taste <br>
plain flour <br>
or gluten-free mix of 
cornflour and brown rice flour for coating<br>
failsafe oil <br>

<p>Mix chicken with garlic and salt and let stand for about 30 minutes. Roll 
chicken pieces in flour until all are coated then freeze for 15 minutes to make 
flour stick better. Shallow fry in failsafe oil until crisp and golden brown. 
Or for a low fat alternative: place chicken pieces in a bowl and stir with stir 
with salt and flour until well coated. Then stir with enough oil to make sure 
all pieces are coated. Bake in a preheated 180&deg;C oven for 1 hour. Serve 
with Healthy Choice oven fry chips and green beans, or in a failsafe burger 
roll with salad &ndash; Deborah Halliwell</p> 
<p><strong>Home-made additive free sausage rolls</strong></p> Pastry - 2 
packets Pampas Butter Puff Pastry frozen sheets (not rolls)<br>
