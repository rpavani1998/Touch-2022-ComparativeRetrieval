<p>&ldquo;Experience the Cabela&rsquo;s Adventure Today&rdquo;&nbsp; 
-Cabela&rsquo;s website</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A new Cabela&rsquo;s store opened April 19, 2012 in Tulalip, 
Washington.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hunting. Fishing. Outdoor Gear. World&rsquo;s Foremost 
Outfitter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, joy.&nbsp;<em>E</em><em>xactly</em> what the world 
needs more of:&nbsp; glorification of animal killing.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Walk through the main door and look up to see two mounted Orcas 
chasing a school of Chinook.&rdquo;&nbsp; -HeraldNet</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since opening day, the parking lot&rsquo;s been constantly packed.&nbsp; I 
know this because I drive past the place every time I drive to and from 
work.&nbsp; (Between the Tulalip Tribe Resort/Casino, the new Cabela&rsquo;s 
and the adjacent Seattle Premium Outlets (outlet mall), there is<em>no</em> 
evidence that<em>I</em> can see of our &ldquo;down economy.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, I 
digress.)</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Displays will feature 200 animal mounts, including bears, elk, 
grouse and otters.&rdquo;&nbsp; -HeraldNet</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>There is a banner displayed on the outside of the store:&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Personal Defense &amp; Home Protection.&rdquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Let me see if I&rsquo;ve got this straight:&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the 
quintessential Cabela&rsquo;s customer.&nbsp; You enter the store to buy items 
that are specifically designed to&ndash; track, sight, call, bait, lure, decoy, 
catch, shoot, target, kill, gut, skin, butcher, season, cure, brine, grill, 
dehydrate, smoke, grind, slice, and vacuum seal&ndash; living, breathing, 
sentient animals who are simply minding their own business, trying to survive 
and thrive.&nbsp; Right so far?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You&ndash; Mr. Average Joe Hunter &amp; Mr Average Bob Fisherman&ndash; go 
out in nature with all of your Cabela&rsquo;s &ldquo;goods&rdquo; with the hope 
that something&ndash;<em>someone</em>&ndash; will die at your hands.&nbsp; If 
the purchased items fulfill their intended purposes, then lives<em>will</em> be 
taken.</p> 
<p>You want to take the life of an animal.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not your life, 
it&rsquo;s his life (or hers).&nbsp; But you want it for yourself.&nbsp; His 
body belongs to<em>him</em>, but you don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; You feel entitled 
to it.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t consider<em>his</em> needs, only your own 
wants.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t empathize with the animal, despite the fact that 
he will fight to survive in whatever situation becomes threatening to him.</p> 
<p>How ironic that&hellip;</p> 
<p>When you navigate the world, you want to remain comfortable.&nbsp; You seek 
contentment.&nbsp; You know that your life is your own.&nbsp; Your body belongs 
to you.&nbsp; You withdraw from pain.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to be hurt, 
and you don&rsquo;t want to be killed.&nbsp; You will defend yourself against 
threats to your safety and the safety of your family.&nbsp; Maintain 
&ldquo;PERSONAL DEFENSE.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>When you come home, you expect that your shelter will be undisturbed.&nbsp; 
You don&rsquo;t want others to take that which does not belong to them.&nbsp; 
You assume that your belongings are secure because &ldquo;what&rsquo;s yours is 
yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Maintain &ldquo;HOME PROTECTION.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p> 
<p>You want to take the life of another, but you don&rsquo;t want to have the 
same circumstance visited upon yourself?&nbsp; It makes no sense to me 
whatsoever.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see the contradiction?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you 
choose to live in a better way?&nbsp; If you think you have the courage to do 
so, then I can help show you how.&nbsp; Let me help you.</p>

<h2>Chickpea Pumpkin Seed&nbsp;Burgers</h2> 
<p>April 29, 2012 in Food Porn | Tags: beans, bind, broccoli, burger sauce, 
chickpea, Chickpea Pumpkin Seed Burgers, cholesterol free, delicious, Dreena 
Burton, egg free, healthy, horseradish, kale, legumes, Let Them Eat Vegan!, low 
sugar, minimal fat, oat, potato, potato chips, pumpkin seed, Raw-nch Dressing, 
romaine lettuce, Vegan, vegan burger, vegetarian, veggie dip, whole plant 
ingredients, Yukon Gold | Leave a comment </p> 
<p>Go!&nbsp; Get yourself a copy of Dreena Burton&rsquo;s latest cookbook, 
&ldquo;Let Them Eat Vegan.&rdquo;&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.&nbsp; 
I love the way Dreena cooks and bakes.&nbsp; Her creations have the perfect 
balance of healthy and delicious.&nbsp; She uses primarily whole plant 
ingredients, plenty of beans/legumes, minimal added fats and &ldquo;just 
enough&rdquo; sweetener.&nbsp; Eat all you want because there&rsquo;s zero 
guilt!</p> 
<p>The first recipe I tried was the Chickpea Pumpkin Seed Burgers on page 
136.&nbsp; At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure that the burgers would hold together, 
but after I let the patties sit for about an hour they held up just fine in the 
pan.&nbsp; I cooked 2 and refrigerated the other 4 patties (between layers of 
parchment paper in a storage container.)&nbsp; Now I know that oats are a 
secret ingredient for vegan burger success!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve used gluten flour 
before, but I&rsquo;ve never used oats.&nbsp; Oats work great&ndash; I think 
they&rsquo;re my new favorite cooking ingredient!&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;resting&rdquo; time must allow the oats to soak up moisture and this 
helps bind the burger.</p> 
<p>For Burger Night #1 we had a side salad with a creamy horseradish dressing 
and some roasted Yukon Gold potatoes, carrots, celery and onion.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For Burger Night #2 I made the Raw-nch Dressing on page 47.&nbsp; I 
didn&rsquo;t have fresh parsley so I used kale instead.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; 
The dressing made for a great romaine lettuce dip<em>and</em> burger 
sauce.&nbsp; We made some homemade potato chips!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For Burger Night #3 we had steamed broccoli.&nbsp; Raw-nch Dressing also 
makes a great veggie dip.<br>
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to making more out of Let Them Eat Vegan!</p>

<h2>Milk a&nbsp;Plant</h2>

<p>Milk a bean, milk a grain, milk a nut, milk a seed, milk a drupe (yes, a 
drupe!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupe), but please don&rsquo;t milk an 
animal.&nbsp; When people consume milk from lactating animals, the first thing 
you should ponder is<em>what</em> is baby cow&ndash; baby goat&ndash; baby 
sheep&ndash; drinking?&nbsp;<em>What</em> happens <em>to</em> the baby 
animals?&nbsp;<em>What</em> happens to momma cow&ndash; momma goat&ndash; momma 
sheep when her overworked reproductive system stops being 
&ldquo;profitable&rdquo;?&nbsp; The bad news is that the answers aren&rsquo;t 
pretty.</p> 
<p>The good news is that non-dairy milk options are plentiful.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s easier than you might think to wean off animal milk.&nbsp; There is 
no nutritional need for animal milk in the human diet!</p> 
<p>Go to the non-dairy milk section of your local store and you&rsquo;ll 
notice an ever-increasing array of plant milks:&nbsp; Soy milk, rice milk, oat 
milk, almond milk, hazelnut milk, hemp milk, coconut milk..even flax 
milk!&nbsp; There are different brands of each type of milk.&nbsp; There are 
different varieties within the types of plant milks..like plain, vanilla, 
chocolate, unsweetened, fortified.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t like one, try 
another.&nbsp; Find your favorite!&nbsp; My favorite is WestSoy Plus Plain 
Soymilkhttp://www.westsoymilk.com/index.php.</p> 
<p>Holiday flavors (YUM!) &ndash; Pumpkin Spice, Chocolate Peppermint, Nog</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Make your &ldquo;own&rdquo; milk:&nbsp; it&rsquo;s easy to do and you 
needn&rsquo;t endure a long pregnancy and painful delivery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
also less expensive than packaged milk and more eco-friendly.&nbsp; Personally, 
I don&rsquo;t like the aftertaste of packaged almond milks but I love homemade 
almond milk.&nbsp; I encourage you to make your own nut and rice milks.&nbsp; 
Here&rsquo;s how I do it&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>First, make sure you have a batch of cooked <strong>short</strong> grain 
brown rice on hand.&nbsp; I make up a batch and freeze portions in 1/2 cup 
glass jam jars.&nbsp; One cup (dried) rice will make enough for 7 batches of 
milk.</p> 
<p>You must use short grain rice!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want your milk to have 
a gritty sediment, do you?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the difference between long and 
short grains?&nbsp; The answer is in the percentage of the starches amylose and 
amylopectin.&nbsp; (I first learned about them from chef Alton 
Brown&hellip;thanks, A.B.!)</p> 
<p>Long grain rice has a higher percentage of amylose.&nbsp; Amylose makes the 
rice cook up dry, firm and separate.&nbsp; Amylose is insoluble in water.&nbsp; 
Rice milk made from long grains has more of a &ldquo;gritty&rdquo; 
sediment.&nbsp; The resulting milk is more watery, less creamy = not good!</p> 
<p>Short grain rice has a higher percentage of amylopectin.&nbsp; It releases 
starch when cooking, resulting in a moist, soft and sticky grain.&nbsp; The 
resulting milk will be creamy without a gritty sediment = good!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>On to the nuts&hellip;pick your favorite <em>raw</em> nut.&nbsp; I like to 
use Brazil nuts, but sometimes I mix it up and use cashews, almonds, or 
hazelnuts.</p> 
<p>Nut Rice Milk (my own creation):</p> 
<p>Soak 1/3 cup raw nuts and 2 pitted dates into 4 cups water for 4-8 
hours.&nbsp; Blend the water, nuts and dates with 1/2 cup cooked short grain 
rice and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a VitaMix blender or other 
&ldquo;sporty&rdquo; blender.&nbsp; (I don&rsquo;t know if it would work with a 
wimpy blender!)&nbsp; Frothy, healthy, affordable and delicious!&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t strain my milk.&nbsp; I simply shake, then pour.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My personal favorite is mixing my homemade nut rice milk with the packaged 
WestSoy soymilk in a 50-50 ratio.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just me!&nbsp; You do what 
you gotta do&hellip;as long as you leave the animals alone!</p>

<p>Spaghetti can be a quick dinner requiring little more than heating 
spaghetti sauce &amp; cooking pasta.&nbsp; But jarred sauce is not too 
exciting.&nbsp; This &ldquo;meaty&rdquo; add-in turns a plain spaghetti dinner 
into something much more tasty, nutritious, and satisfying.&nbsp; You can also 
incorporate it into lasagna, manicotti and more&hellip;</p> 
<p>Make this large batch and portion into 1/2 cup size glass freezer 
jars.&nbsp; It will make about 10 servings.&nbsp; Freeze.&nbsp; Then, on 
&ldquo;spaghetti night,&rdquo; just thaw and heat up one jar (1/2 cup) Italian 
Mushroom Saute into 1/2 jar (26 oz jar size) of vegan spaghetti sauce (Serves 
2).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Italian Mushroom Saute</p> 
<p>1 T Coconut Oil (for the pan)</p> 
<p>1 Carrot and/or 1 Red Pepper (chopped)<br>
 1 Medium Onion (chopped)<br>
 
Several Cloves Garlic (to taste) (minced)</p> 
<p>Dash salt &amp; pepper<br>
 1 T dried basil<br>
 1 T Italian Seasoning Blend
<br> 1 T Nutritional Yeast Flakes<br>
 1/8-1/4 t Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</p> 
<p>15 med-large Crimini Mushrooms (chopped)<br>
 10 med-large Shiitake 
Mushrooms (chopped)</p> 
<p>1 T Vegan Worcestershire Sauce (i.e without anchovy)<br>
 1 T Balsamic 
Vinegar<br>
 1 T Vinegar from Kalamata Olive Jar</p> 
<p>6 Kalamata Olives (pitted and minced)<br>
 2 Sun-dried Tomato (oil packed 
or dried &amp; rehydrated; minced)</p> 
<p>1 T Red Cooking Wine</p> 
<p>In a large saute pan, heat the oil on medium heat and gradually add the 
ingredients in the following order:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Onion, Garlic &amp; Carrot/Red Pepper + Spices</li> 
<li>Mushrooms</li> 
<li>Worcestershire, Vinegars</li> 
<li>Olives, Tomato</li>

<h2>Who&rsquo;s&nbsp;Afraid?</h2> 
<p>April 22, 2012 in Think About It | Tags: Vegan, Ruby Roth, That's Why We 
Don't Eat Animals, Vegan is Love, compassionate, children, parents, The Today

<p></p> 
<p>Beware!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a new children&rsquo;s book coming out this 
week.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Vegan is Love:&nbsp; Having Heart &amp; 
Taking Action,&rdquo; by Ruby Roth.&nbsp; A book about living compassionately 
surely needs a warning label, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp; Fortunately, the 
U.S. media&rsquo;s version of that label aired on Friday, April 20th on 
NBC&rsquo;s The Today Show.</p> 
<p>The show&rsquo;s pre-recorded segment with Ruby Roth about her new book was 
a positive portrayal of vegan parenting.&nbsp; Ruby&rsquo;s young stepdaughter 
indicated that her favorite food is KALE.&nbsp; Impressive!&nbsp; Fortunately, 
the nutritional integrity of a healthy vegan diet for children was not called 
into question&hellip;because it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p> 
<p>Instead&hellip;great &ldquo;concerns&rdquo; were voiced by the 2 in-studio 
guests regarding the supposed use of &ldquo;scare tactics&rdquo; in the book 
(surrounding food as well as other issues of animal exploitation, such as 
animal testing.)&nbsp; To hear the guests speak, you&rsquo;d think that 
Ruby&rsquo;s book will scar children for life:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There is so much fear in this book.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do we 
have to scare them?&rdquo;&nbsp; The book is &ldquo;teaching kids to fear 
food.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fear, guilt, &ldquo;graphic pictures:&rdquo;&nbsp; Very 
scary stuff.</p> 
<p>But <em>who</em> is really afraid of this stuff?&nbsp; Is it really the 
children?&nbsp; Will they seriously be harmed by a book that honestly exposes 
them to the real world?&nbsp; Are children so fragile that they cannot handle 
the truth about animal exploitation, when it is presented with gentle candor 
and realistic illustrations?&nbsp; Will children truly react negatively, or 
will they logically respond with compassion and concern?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t 
children want to help animals and take action?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think we 
give children nearly enough credit.</p> 
<p>I think the <em>adults</em> are the fearful ones.&nbsp; Fearful and feeling 
guilty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s actually the adults who can&rsquo;t bear to look at 
graphic pictures of animal slaughter.&nbsp; Adults won&rsquo;t listen to the 
truth about unnecessary animal exploitation.&nbsp; Adults are resistant to 
change.&nbsp; Adults don&rsquo;t want their routines disrupted, their palate 
pleasure disturbed, or their minds opened.</p> 
<p>Are adults&ndash; parents&ndash; most of all afraid of having their own 
apathy exposed?&nbsp; If, for example, their children reads the book elsewhere 
and comes home to share the cruel truths with them&hellip;what then?&nbsp; How 
will they justify their own complicity in the violence?&nbsp; How will they try 
to convince their children that they<em>do</em> care when maybe they really 
don&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Or, if they genuinely care, then how will they explain the 
hypocrisy in their actions?&nbsp; Children are quite capable of recognizing 
inconsistencies.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop pretending to worry about the children.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;re just fine.&nbsp; Children are inherently open-minded, curious, 
and adaptable.&nbsp; Children very easily grasp the basic concept of Veganism, 
which is about non-harming.&nbsp; Young children, in particular, naturally 
consider animals their friends.&nbsp; Why would they want to hurt their friends?
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Vegan is Love&rdquo; gently asks young readers to take personal 
responsibility in the form of taking actions that help make the world a better 
place for animals.&nbsp; Children are not afraid to do that.&nbsp; They are not 
fearful.&nbsp; Adults could learn a lot from children.</p> 
<p>Here is a perfect example of what I&rsquo;m talking about, written by my 
vegan friend from Indonesia:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I did a talk on Veganism to a bunch of 7 year olds.&nbsp; They 
totally get it.&nbsp; We also went to a local market in Indonesia and one of 
the kids happened to see a chicken killed.&nbsp; During the subsequent talk 
about what happened, children mentioned how horrible that was.&nbsp; I said, I 
know, but how to you think the meat comes to you?&nbsp; One little girl said, 
&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s mean. That chicken wants to have a family and look 
after its babies too!&rsquo;&nbsp; I said &lsquo;I agree with you,&rsquo; and 
she said, completely off her own back, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to eat 
animals either!&rsquo;&nbsp; Kids get it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Pushy Pushy&nbsp;Vegans</h2> 
<p>April 20, 2012 in Think About It | Tags: Vegan, Washington, push, pushy,

<p></p> 
<p>The problem is animal exploitation.&nbsp; The solution is Veganism.</p> 
<p>Step 1:&nbsp; You.&nbsp; Change must start with YOU.&nbsp; First <em>you
</em> go vegan.&nbsp; <em>You</em> stop consuming animals, wearing animals, and 
buying products made of animals or tested on animals.&nbsp;<em>You</em> stop 
going to venues using animals to entertain.&nbsp;<em>You</em> stop accepting 
that animals are just commodities to use.&nbsp;<em>You</em> start thinking 
about animals as individuals with their own interests. Simple.</p> 
<p>Step 2:&nbsp; NOW WHAT??&nbsp; Now that you&rsquo;ve changed, what do <em>
you</em> do next?&nbsp; Do you leave it at that?&nbsp; Or, do you speak up and 
try to help effect change in others?&nbsp; Remember &ndash; the point of going 
vegan isn&rsquo;t to join a &ldquo;club&rdquo; that follows a strict set of 
&ldquo;rules.&rdquo;&nbsp; The<em>point</em> is to help solve a very serious 
social justice problem.</p> 
<p>Solving problems of gargantuan proportion depends on the collective effort 
of many.&nbsp; No &ldquo;group&rdquo; is more oppressed than non-human 
animals.&nbsp; For the human culture to stop conceptualizing animals as 
primarily &ldquo;things to consume&rdquo; is going to take a monumental<strong>
push</strong> for change.</p> 
<p>Definitions: &ldquo;<strong>push</strong>&rdquo;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>To urge forward or urge insistently; pressure:&nbsp; &ldquo;Push a child 
to study harder.&rdquo;</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>To extend or enlarge:&nbsp; &ldquo;Push society past the frontier.&rdquo;
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>To promote or sell:&nbsp; &ldquo;The author pushed her latest book.&rdquo;
</li> </ul> 
<p>So who is pushing for change?&nbsp; Vegans.&nbsp; Non-vegans won&rsquo;t do 
it.&nbsp; Vegetarians won&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; Vegans are the only ones 
advocating 100% for the rights of animals not to be used.</p> 
<p>Passionate vegans work for the greater good.&nbsp; By promoting Veganism, 
we &ldquo;urge&rdquo; others to act with fairness toward sentient beings.&nbsp; 
We put &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; on the status quo.&nbsp; We ask others to 
&ldquo;enlarge&rdquo; their circle of compassion to include all animals.&nbsp; 
We &ldquo;promote&rdquo; non-violence.&nbsp; These are good things.&nbsp; Yet, 
passionate, active, vocal vegans are frequently called &ldquo;pushy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Definition: &ldquo;<strong>pushy</strong>&rdquo;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>offensively assertive or forceful</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>marked by aggressive ambition and energy and initiative</li> </ul> 
<p>Hmm&hellip;pushy sounds bad.&nbsp; So how did we get from 
&ldquo;push&rdquo; to &ldquo;pushy?&rdquo;&nbsp; How did we get from the words, 
&ldquo;urge forward / extend / promote&rdquo; to &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;aggressive?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I think it has more to do with how non-vegans <em>react</em> to being 
challenged than anything else.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&nbsp;<em></em>
really matters what the frequency&ndash; the content&ndash; the delivery 
method&ndash; of the vegan message is.&nbsp; The vegan message itself is 
considered inherently &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; in a culture where animal 
exploitation is ubiquitous.&nbsp; Where animal slaughter is condoned, those who 
speak in protest are considered the &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; ones.&nbsp; All a 
vegan has to do is open his or her mouth to be labelled 
&ldquo;pushy.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one minds a quiet vegan!</p> 
<p>Push&hellip;pushy.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&nbsp; The bottom 
line is we have a long way to go to shift the paradigm.&nbsp; The animals need 
our help so we can&rsquo;t keep quiet.&nbsp; So, spreaders of the vegan 
message:&nbsp; Keep pushing for change&hellip;you pushy, pushy vegans!</p>

<h2>Silly&nbsp;Skins</h2> 
<p>April 17, 2012 in Get Out &amp; Live Life | Tags: Backcountry, climbing 
skins, freeheel, Mission Ridge, nylon, outdoors, seal, seal skin, severe tire 
damage, Ski, skins, steep slope, Telemark, Vegan, Washington, Wenatchee | Leave 
a comment </p> 
<p>This video was taken exactly 2 years ago&hellip;4/17/10.&nbsp; Here I was 
with my brand new skins.&nbsp; They are ridiculously sticky when new.&nbsp; I 
thought that Eric was taking my picture.&nbsp; I was trying to make a fierce 
face.&nbsp; Then I realized he was taking a movie and it cracked me up!&nbsp; I 
love Eric&rsquo;s commentary.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>To climb uphill with skis on, you must apply &ldquo;skins&rdquo; to the ski 
bottoms.&nbsp; (Unless the skis themselves are made for climbing.)&nbsp; They 
work like this:&nbsp; when you glide the ski uphill&ndash; forward&ndash; the 
fibers run flat, but when you stop or try to slide backward the fibers 
&ldquo;stand up&rdquo; and grip the snow.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t slide backward 
unless the slope is very steep or the snow is glossy ice, or if you don&rsquo;t 
weight your ski properly on a steep slope.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pretty strange 
feeling the first time you realize you&rsquo;re not going to slip!</p> 
<p>(Think of those directional spikes you drive over in your 
car&hellip;&ldquo;Caution: Severe Tire Damage!&rdquo;&hellip;You can roll 
forward and the spikes flatten, but if you travel in 
reverse&hellip;Yikes!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same concept.)</p> 
<p>Back in the days of &ldquo;old,&rdquo; seal skin was used.&nbsp; Not 
vegan!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking that people might have used their skis for 
travel and not solely for recreation in those days?&nbsp; Maybe it<em>was</em> 
necessary to use seal skin once upon a time?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It 
doesn&rsquo;t matter now because the past is the past.&nbsp; Point is, we 
don&rsquo;t need to use the skin of a seal anymore.</p> 
<p>When you <em>can</em> do better, you <em>should</em> do better and you <em>
better</em> do better&hellip;right?&nbsp; Now, we use nylon skins.&nbsp; 
Continuing to use the word &ldquo;skin&rdquo; is kind of icky, but it&rsquo;s a 
good reminder of how times change even though words tend to persist.&nbsp; 
Change is good!</p>

<h2>Give Cancer a&nbsp;Boost?</h2>

comment </p> 
<p>I flipped open another new chart today at work in the skilled nursing 
facility.&nbsp; Bladder cancer &ndash; status post cystectomy &amp; 
ileostomy.&nbsp; Ovarian cancer &ndash; status post oophorectomy.&nbsp; 
Metastatic to lymph nodes.&nbsp; History of breast cancer with 
mastectomy.&nbsp; All in one patient.&nbsp; A very nice lady, by the way.</p> 
<p>She had TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) in the hospital, but that was 
removed and now she&rsquo;s taking food orally.&nbsp; But has no 
appetite.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s barely over 100 pounds.</p> 
<p>The physician&rsquo;s written plan for this woman with 2 &ldquo;high&rdquo; 
grade cancers that are metastatic to lymph nodes reads:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;High protein, high calorie drinks.&nbsp; Push at least 6 cans of 
Boost a day.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>6 cans of Boost a day?&nbsp; <strong>WHAT</strong>?!&nbsp; Are you serious?
</p> 
<p>The medical community has really lost their way if recommending 6 cans of 
Boost per day is the<em>best</em> that can be done for unfortunate patients 
such as this woman riddled with cancer.</p> 
<p>As the saying goes&hellip; &ldquo;If I had a dollar&rdquo; for every time 
that these hideous protein drinks are recommended in hospitals &amp; nursing 
homes &amp; assisted living facilities all over the country, then I&rsquo;d 
be&hellip;well&hellip;a big-wig at Nestle (maker of Boost) or Abbott (maker of 
Ensure.)</p> 
<p>Dear Average Doctor in the USA:</p> 
<p>Do you know that continually recommending Boost or similar &ldquo;protein 
drinks&rdquo; (like Ensure) will only sicken and kill your patients quicker?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the ingredient lists&hellip;</p> 
<p>Boost (Chocolate Flavor):</p> 
<p>Water<br>
 Sugar<br>
 Corn Syrup<br>
 Milk Protein Concentrate<br>
 
Vegetable Oil (Canola, High Oleic Sunflower, Corn)<br>
 Cocoa<br>
 Soy Protein 
Isolate<br>
 Less than 0.5% of:&nbsp; Soy 
Lecithin/Carrageenan/Flavors/Cellulose gel/Vitamins/Minerals</p> 
<p>Ensure (Chocolate) Nutrition Shake:</p> 
<p>Water<br>
 Corn Maltodextrin<br>
 Sugar (Sucrose)<br>
 Corn Syrup<br>
 Milk 
Protein Concentrate<br>
 Cocoa Powder<br>
 Soy oil<br>
 Soy Protein Isolate<br>

 Canola oil<br>
 Less than 0.5% of:&nbsp; Corn oil/Flavors/Colors/Soy 
Lecithin/Carrageenan/Multivitamin/Minerals</p> 
<p>My questions:</p> 
<p><em>Where</em> is the NUTRITION in these drinks?&nbsp; All I see is a 
&ldquo;sugar oil milk multivitamin &amp; mineral&rdquo; drink.&nbsp; (No<em>
wonder</em> patients don&rsquo;t do much better choking these things down than 
they do consuming the standard, devoid-of-nutrition institutional food!)</p> 
<p><em>What</em> about the strong link between milk protein (casein) and 
cancer promotion?&nbsp;<em>Who</em> in their right mind would suggest a cancer 
patient consume ANY dairy products?</p> 
<p><em>What</em> about the effect that sugar has on cancer promotion?</p> 
<p>Has <em>anyone</em> considered the effect of GMOs in these low quality 
drinks?&nbsp; Canola, Soy, Corn:&nbsp; GMO crops.&nbsp; (I don&rsquo;t see the 
&ldquo;Organic&rdquo; label on Boost or Ensure.)</p> 
<p><em>Can&rsquo;t</em> we do a whole lot better?&nbsp; How about recommending 
REAL food that is actually nutrient dense?&nbsp; How about recommending simple 
to make smoothies that are delicious and easy to digest?&nbsp; Take a<em>
separate</em> multivitamin &amp; mineral supplement if you like.</p> 
<p>Pick some of these ingredients and blend them together:</p> 
<p>Banana, coconut milk, almond butter, flax meal, dark leafy greens, chia 
seeds, walnuts, avocado, hemp seed, organic soy milk, fresh fruit, silken tofu, 
wheat germ, coconut based yogurt and more&hellip;</p> 
<p>Now, <em>that</em> would give cancer patients (and other sick people) a 
fighting chance.</p>

<h2>Trotters</h2> 
<p>April 15, 2012 in Think About It | Tags: Hooves, life over death, meat 
counter, Pig, Pig's Feet, soup stocks | Leave a comment </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at a picture that must have been taken at a meat 
processing plant.&nbsp; All you can see in the image is a bin full of 
pigs&rsquo; hooves, including the lower leg portion.&nbsp; The legs were 
removed&ndash; not at the first joint&ndash; but the second.&nbsp; The skin 
appears pale, close to white.&nbsp; The hooves are distinctly pink, which is 
obviously blood, but the darkness/lightness of the color varies.</p> 
<p>I guess these are called &ldquo;trotters.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, I 
looked it up.&nbsp; How demoralizing.&nbsp; I guess they are used to make soup 
stocks, but apparently they are also considered a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; cut of 
meat.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; It looks disgusting to me, but how 
is it<em>really</em> any different than eating the leg of a turkey or the wing 
of a chicken?</p> 
<p>I wonder how many animals&rsquo; remains are in this bin&hellip;there must 
be several dozens of leg parts in only the little portion of the photo that 
I&rsquo;m looking at.&nbsp; It seems so senseless and so unnecessary to kill 
animals who would have chosen life over death if given the choice.</p> 
<p>In the world that I envision, these hooves &amp; lower legs would not be in 
a bin destined for cellophane wrapping in the grocery meat counter.&nbsp; 
Neither would they be salted and smoked and preserved in hot vinegar, put in 
jars&hellip;called &ldquo;pigs feet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, I&rsquo;d like these hooves attached to their rightful owners.&nbsp; 
Living, breathing pigs who are individuals just like you and me.&nbsp; I want 
to see the whole pig, and admire her place on Earth as a friend.&nbsp; My 
necklace reads &ldquo;Friend, Not Food.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes,<em>that&rsquo;s</em> 
the way I&rsquo;d like it to be.</p>

<h2>Go For&nbsp;It!</h2> 
<p>April 14, 2012 in Go Vegan Tips | Tags: Cornice, Mission Ridge, Windy Ridge 
|Leave a comment </p> 
<p>Go Vegan Tip #1</p> 
<p>JUMP in!&nbsp; At some point you&rsquo;ve just got to GO for it.&nbsp; 
Going vegan is not something you do half way.&nbsp; You might be a little 
afraid, but there is nothing to fear.&nbsp; Once you do it, you&rsquo;ll see 
that it was<em>much</em> easier than you thought.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be glad 
you did and you&rsquo;ll be wondering what took you so long!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I know it&rsquo;s basic, but it&rsquo;s true:&nbsp; Attitude IS 
everything.&nbsp; So jump into veganism with your whole being.&nbsp; 
Smile.&nbsp; This is not a diet &ndash; it is a beautiful way of living and the 
best way to honor the LIFE in all living beings.</p> 
<p>Veganism puts your innermost values of compassion and fairness into 
action.&nbsp; Congratulations for making a profoundly positive decision.&nbsp; 
Get excited!&nbsp; Seek support.&nbsp; Have fun trying new things.&nbsp; Enjoy 
the positive changes.&nbsp; Learn all you can.&nbsp; Negativity is OUT.</p> 
<p>If you look for abundance you will find it. If you look for deprivation you 
will find it.&nbsp; Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now that wasn&rsquo;t too difficult, was it?</p>

coconut oil for several minutes, then add the water, tomato puree, vegan 
sausage and the cooked, rinsed beans.&nbsp; Simmer everything for ~40-60 
minutes.&nbsp; (Just make sure the beans are fully cooked if your beans were 
only partly cooked when you put them in the pot.)&nbsp; Add more water if 
needed to get the desired thickness.&nbsp; Make it more spicy if you want!</p> 
<p>Makes 9 pints&hellip;Freeze &lsquo;em up!&nbsp; Use wide mouth glass 
canning jars.</p> 
<p>Enjoy my recipe!<br>

<h2>Free My Own Mind&nbsp;First</h2>

<p>Here goes my first blog post!</p> 
<p>Just yesterday I listened to a podcast that must have been made for 
me.&nbsp; It reinforced everything that the &ldquo;little voice&rdquo; in my 
head has been telling me for quite a number of months.&nbsp; It just took me 
way too long to start acting on it!</p> 
<p>A week ago, I decided to start this blog because I want my version of 
on-line vegan outreach to go &ldquo;beyond Facebook&rdquo; and get out into the 
universe.&nbsp; I believe I need to get this message out, even if no one reads 
it.</p> 
<p>The podcast is Raw Vegan Radio&rsquo;s episode 0127 with Markus 
Rothkranz.&nbsp; See the link here: &nbsp;Raw Vegan Radio 0127</p> 
<p>Here are some key phrases that really resonated with me:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Listen to your heart &amp; have the courage to do what it says.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Give up.&nbsp; Stop resisting.&nbsp; Get out of your own way and let it 
come naturally.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Start walking in the direction that feels right and the path will reveal 
itself.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>You&rsquo;re the only one doing it YOUR way.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Clean out anything that&rsquo;s a burden.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>I&rsquo;m not in it for myself.</li> </ul> 
<p>With these thoughts in mind I proceed with my little blog&hellip;spreading 
my message in my own way!</p>
