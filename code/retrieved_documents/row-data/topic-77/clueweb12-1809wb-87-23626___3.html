<p>Your health is affected by what you eat.&nbsp;A healthy diet can help you 
maintain a healthy weight and can help you get all the nutrients your body 
needs.&nbsp;Also, if you get pregnant, eating a healthy diet now can help 
ensure the health of any future pregnancies.&nbsp;The health of a baby can be 
affected by the mother&rsquo;s diet before she becomes pregnant.&nbsp;Here are 
some tips for healthier eating:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Vary your veggies.</strong> Fill half of your plate with 
vegetables.&nbsp;Eat more dark green veggies, such as broccoli, kale, and 
spinach; orange veggies, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and squash; and beans 
and peas, such as pinto beans, kidney beans, black beans, garbanzo beans, split 
peas, and lentils.</li> 
<li><strong>Focus on fruits. </strong>Choose whole fruit instead of juice to 
get more fiber and less sugar. Aim for at least 2 cups a day.&nbsp;What counts 
as 1 cup of fruit: 1 small apple, 1 large banana, about 30 grapes, 1 medium 
grapefruit, 1 large orange, 1 large peach, 1 medium pear, 2 large plums, 8 
large strawberries, 1 cup canned fruit, &frac12; cup dried fruit.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Choose calcium-rich foods.</strong> Get 3 cups of fat-free or 
low-fat milk, low-fat yogurt and/or low-fat cheese every day.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Eat whole grains.</strong> Eat at least 3 ounces of whole-grain 
cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta every day. One ounce is about 1 slice 
of bread, 1 cup of breakfast cereal,or &frac12; cup of cooked rice or pasta. 
Make sure that grains such as wheat, rice, oats, or corn are referred to as 
&quot;whole&quot; or &ldquo;whole grain&rdquo; at the<strong>beginning</strong> 
of the ingredients list.</li> 
<li><strong>Go lean with protein.</strong> Choose lean meats and poultry. Bake 
it, broil it, microwave it, or grill it. And vary your protein 
choices&mdash;with more fish, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and soy products. For 
more information about fish, visit

</li> 
<li><strong>Limit fats and salt.&nbsp;</strong>Read the Nutrition Facts label 
on foods.&nbsp;Choose foods with less than 30 percent of the calories from fat 
and less than 10 percent of the calories from saturated fats.&nbsp;Eat less 
than 2,300 mg (approximately 1 teaspoon of salt) of sodium per day and choose 
and prepare foods with little salt</li> 
<li><strong>Limit sugars.&nbsp;</strong>Drink plenty of water instead of 
sweetened drinks.&nbsp;Fruit drinks, regular soft drinks, sweets, cookies, 
cakes, and candies provide empty calories and cause rapid changes to your 
body&rsquo;s blood sugar.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Limit fast food.&nbsp;</strong>If you do have fast foods 
sometimes, you can still make healthier choices.&nbsp;Choose foods that are 
grilled instead of fried.&nbsp;Have a salad, soup, or fruit instead of fries. 
&nbsp;Use mustard or ketchup instead of mayonnaise.&nbsp;Order smaller 
entr&eacute;e portions.&nbsp;For example, instead of a large sub, try a small 
sub with a side salad or fruit.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
