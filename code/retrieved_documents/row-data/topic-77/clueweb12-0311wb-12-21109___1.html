 Tips on buying and storing whole foods <br>
<br>
 Written by Stephen Leckie

<p>Whole foods need to be eaten fresh for the best flavour and nutrition. 
Natural foods contain no chemical preservatives, so their shelf life is shorter 
than for refined products.</p>
<p>Almost half of all food is wasted in North America so it is also important 
to develop good shopping and storage habits to help reduce this needless waste.
<br></p> 
<h2>Where to shop</h2> 
<p><strong>Natural food stores, bulk stores, buying clubs</strong> and some 
supermarkets are the best places to find fresh whole foods. Choose a store that 
has a commitment to freshness. If items on the shelves are dusty, this is a 
sign of slow turnover and perhaps a signal to shop elsewhere. Also check for 
expiry dates.</p> 
<p>Many <strong>supermarkets</strong> are expanding their vegetarian and 
natural food selection, but their business model relies on a long shelf life. 
To achieve this, natural food products are often overly sweet, refined, and 
packaged. Or products may go off before being purchased. I once bought whole 
wheat flour from a supermarket that must have been sitting too long on the 
shelf. The muffins I made from it had a rancid taste.</p> 
<p>For <strong>fresh fruits and vegetables</strong>, the best places to shop 
are farmers markets, produce stores, and the larger natural food stores that 
carry organic produce. Look forlocally-grown produce. Not only does it tend to 
be fresher, it is also best for the environment as it does not require long 
distance shipping. Fresh produce also retains more nutrients. For example, 
spinach losses half of its nutrient content eight days after being harvested 
(seestudy).</p> 
<p><strong>Where to buy local &amp; organic</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Toronto Area</strong> &ndash; complete listing of Organic delivery 
services, stores, and farmers markets.</li> 
<li><strong>United States</strong> &ndash; Localharvest.org has a great 
zoomable, searchable map of local markets.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Shop at a place that emphasizes freshness, only buy as much as you 
need, and store your foods properly.</strong></p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<h3> Vacuum Containers</h3> 
<p> These containers have a built in hand pump for creating a vacuum seal that 
helps to preserve the flavour, colour, and nutrients in food. I have seen these 
at a kitchen store. They are alsoavailable online.</p> <br>
<br>

<h2>Storing whole foods</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep all unrefined <strong>oils</strong> in the refrigerator with the 
exception of olive oil. Unrefined oils turn rancid quickly at warm temperatures.
</li> 
<li><strong>Whole grains</strong> in unbroken kernels (such as whole grains of 
wheat, rye, millet, corn, and oats), may be kept in tightly covered jars in the 
cupboard. Whole grains that have been cracked, rolled, or ground into flour, 
meal, or flakes should be refrigerated or frozen because the oils that they 
contain gradually go rancid when exposed to oxygen. Brown rice should also be 
kept cool because its oils are in the bran layer, near the surface of the grain.
</li> 
<li>Dried <strong>beans and legumes</strong> can be stored in a cool, dry 
place for many months without loss of nutritional value. But they will become 
more dried out the longer they sit around and take longer to cook.</li> 
<li><strong>Cooked</strong> beans and grains will keep in the refrigerator for 
about one week if they are seasoned with salt. Salt is a natural preservative 
and helps prolong the life of leftovers. Cooked beans and grains can also be 
frozen.</li> 
<li>Bulk <strong>tofu</strong> should be immersed in water in a covered 
container and kept in the refrigerator. If you change the water every day or 
so, tofu will last up to a week or longer. Tofu sold in plastic packages should 
be refrigerated and then placed in a bowl of water after the package has been 
opened. Silken tofu that is sold in tetrapak packages may be kept in the 
cupboard until opened. Tofu will last for up to a week when stored refrigerated 
in a marinade (seerecipe below).</li> 
<li><strong>Tempeh</strong> is usually sold frozen because it is very 
perishable. Once thawed, it will keep in the refrigerator for three or four 
days.</li> 
<li><strong>Nuts, seeds</strong>, and <strong>their butters</strong> also 
contain oils and should be kept refrigerated unless you using them daily.</li> 
<li>If you buy bulk <strong>herbs and spices</strong> in small bags, transfer 
them to glass jars with tight-fitting lids when you get home and keep them from 
light and heat. Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll quickly lose their flavour. They also 
lose flavour over time so only buy as much as you need.</li> 
<li>Whole grain <strong>breads and baked goods</strong> that do not contain 
preservatives also need to be refrigerated, or better yet, frozen, if you are 
not using them right away.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<h2>Storing and ripening fruits</h2> 
<p>Most fruit (including avocados and tomatoes) should be stored at room 
temperature until ripe. Exceptions to this are berries, grapes, fresh figs, 
melons, pineapple, coconut and tangerines. Apples can be refrigerated or stored 
in a cool dark place.</p> 
<p>To <strong>speed ripening</strong>, place fruit in a loosely closed paper 
bag. Leave at room temperature, out of direct sunlight. The paper bag holds in 
ethylene, a gas produced naturally by the fruit, which helps speed up the 
ripening process. Don&rsquo;t use a plastic container as it traps moisture and 
air which causes spoilage.</p> 
<p>Once ripe, eat fruits right away. You can also refrigerate ripe fruits for 
a few days, but<strong>keep them separate</strong> from other veggies, as the 
ethylene gas they emit can speed decay.&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<h3>ExtraLife device </h3> 
<p>ExtraLife helps preserve fresh fruits and vegetables by neutralizing excess 
ethylene gas that builds up in the refrigerator crisper bin as produce ripens. 
This device will add several days of life to your produce, reducing waste and 
saving you money. There is also another brand available called: E.G.G.</p> 
<h3>FridgeSmart<strong> </strong></h3> 
<p>These Tupperware containers have a 'variable ventilation' system that lets 
air circulate freely through the container so that fruit and vegetables 
can&quot; 'breathe'. And a &quot;built-in base grid means they're kept away 
from moisture &ndash; so no more soggy surprises.&quot;</p> <br>
<br>

<h2>Storing vegetables</h2> 
<p>Most vegetables should be stored in the refrigerator. A <strong>cold
</strong> temperature slows respiration, but you don't want to stop the 
breathing completely. Place items loosely in the crisper or in open bags to
<strong>allow breathing</strong>. Don't overcrowd. &quot;The worst thing you 
can do is seal fruits and vegetables in air tight bags&quot; says Barry 
Swanson, professor of food science and human nutrition at Washington State 
University.</p> 
<p><strong>Mushrooms</strong> should be stored refrigerated in paper bags.</p> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wash</strong> fresh fruits and vegetables before 
storing. Fresh produce has a natural protective coating that keeps in moisture 
and freshness. Washing and scrubbing will damage the coating and speed up 
spoilage.</p> 
<p>Produce will last longer when it is <strong>whole</strong>. When shopping, 
look for greens that have some of the stem intact. Don't buy prepared salad 
greens or veggies unless you plan on using them that day. At home, don't chop 
veggies and store the pieces for later use.</p> 
<p>Root veggies such as <strong>beets, carrots</strong> and <strong>radishes
</strong> can be purchased with their greens. For these items, <strong>cut off 
the greens</strong> once you get home to prevent the roots from going soft. 
Radish and beet greens are good in soup.</p> 
<p>For <strong>greens</strong>, <strong>cut off elastic bands</strong> and 
damaged leaves before refrigerating.</p> 
<p><strong>Inspect</strong> your greens daily and remove any wilting leaves. 
Check your other produce and remove any rotting items immediately. One bad 
apple can spoil the bunch.</p> 
<p><strong>Don't refrigerate</strong> garlic, cooking onions, winter squash, 
and potatoes. These items can be stored uncovered in a dark cool place, but try 
to use them up within a week or two.</p> 
<p>Fresh <strong>ginger</strong> will keep for up to a couple of weeks in the 
fridge in a paper bag. Ginger also freezes well, either whole or grated. One of 
the best way to store ginger is to bury it in a small clay pot filled with sand.
</p> 
<p>Some vegetables can be stored for several months in a <strong>root cellar
</strong> if certain criteria are met. The ideal cold storage room must be dry, 
dark and cool (7&deg;C to 10&deg;C). Basements, garages and cupboards in 
today&rsquo;s homes are often not equipped to meet these three conditions.</p>
