<h4>Hungry for Success</h4> 
<h5><strong>Annex D</strong> Practical Guidance for Schools and Caterers</h5> 
<p><strong>Eating for Health</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1. </strong><em>Eating for Health</em> was developed as a model for 
healthy eating in Scotland by the Health Education Board for Scotland in 1996. 
It is nationally recognised and widely used by the food and catering industries 
as well as by health professionals, teachers and individual consumers, as a 
guide to the contents of a balanced meal or diet. In England the equivalent 
model, the<em>Balance of Good Health,</em> was developed in 1994 by the Health 
Local authority, Department of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries 
and Food.</p> 
<p><strong>2. </strong><em>Eating for Health</em> shows the proportion of the 
overall diet that should come from each of the five food groups in order to 
provide enough of the important nutrients (such as vitamins, minerals and 
protein) and fibre without too much fat (especially saturates) and sugar. The 
five food groups are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>bread, other cereals and potatoes</li> 
<li>fruit and vegetables</li> 
<li>milk and dairy foods</li> 
<li>meat, fish and alternatives</li> 
<li>foods high in fat, foods and drinks high in sugar.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>3. </strong>Foods in each group provide a similar range of 
nutrients. For most people:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a third of total food intake should be made up of starchy foods (e.g. 
bread, pasta, rice and potatoes). These foods should make up a main part of a 
meal</li> 
<li>a further third should be made up from fruit and vegetables. People should 
aim to eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables each day
</li> 
<li>meat, fish and alternatives (e.g. eggs, nuts, pulses, soya products) and 
milk and dairy foods provide concentrated sources of essential nutrients. So, 
only moderate amounts need to be eaten</li> 
<li>foods containing a large amount of fat or sugar should make up a 
relatively small proportion of the total food and drink consumed.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>4. </strong>The model applies to catering for most people over the 
age of 5 years, including those who are overweight, vegetarians and people of 
all ethnic groups. Children under 5 years of age need to learn to eat 
healthily, but too much emphasis on cutting down fat intake and increasing the 
amount of fibre eaten is inappropriate for this age group - it can result in a 
bulky diet and children may not be able to eat sufficient amounts of food to 
meet their energy and nutrient needs. By around 5 years of age children should 
be progressing towards a diet based on the principles of<em>Eating for Health
</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>5. </strong>Recent research indicates that currently children in 
Britain are eating less than half the recommended five portions of fruit and 
vegetables each day, too many foods high in saturates, sugar and salt, too few 
foods containing fibre and are not doing enough physical activity (National 
Diet and Nutrition Survey: young people aged 4-18 years (2000)).</p> 
<p><strong>What Does This Mean for Caterers?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>6. </strong><em>Eating for Health</em> is a useful tool for 
caterers in menu planning as it shows the overall balance that should be aimed 
for in the lunches served. Dishes or meals usually contain foods from more than 
one of the five food groups.<em>Eating for Health</em> can be applied by 
identifying the main food items or ingredients in the composite dish or meal 
and thinking about how these fit in with the proportions suggested and by 
altering the proportions, e.g. serving slightly smaller portions of the main 
dishes with extra fruit, vegetables or bread. Whatever the type of catering 
provided, the principles of balance and variety apply.</p> 
<p><strong>7. </strong>Healthier catering for children means:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>offering child-size portions of a variety of meals, not just a range of 
fried favourites</li> 
<li>offering foods from the food groups</li> 
<li> 
<ul> 
<li>fruit and vegetables</li> 
<li>meat, fish and alternatives</li> 
<li>bread, cereals and potatoes</li> 
<li>milk and dairy foods</li> </ul></li> 
<li>limiting fat-rich foods such as sausages, burgers, pies, crisps, chips or 
other fried food</li> 
<li>for young children, offering small fruits and yoghurts which are usually 
popular</li> 
<li>not offering too many sugar rich foods and drinks</li> 
<li>offering milk, unsweetened fruit juice and water</li> 
<li>limiting the amount of salt added to foods.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Choosing Healthier Ingredients</strong></p> 
<p><strong>8. </strong>The choice of commodities can have a significant effect 
on the nutritional content and the balance of meals and foodstuffs. Many 
suppliers have responded to the increasing demand for healthier ingredients, 
which are now easier to find. Pre-prepared products are available that can be 
cooked by one of three methods - oven bake, grill, shallow/deep fry. Labels 
should be checked on pre-prepared dishes to look for lower fat and salt 
varieties.</p> 
<p><strong>Reducing the Fat Content</strong></p> 
<p><strong>9. </strong>Whilst the choice of ingredients is very important, 
several cooking methods and preparation techniques can be used to reduce the 
fat content of dishes.</p> 
<p><strong>10. </strong>Easy ways to cut down on fat in food preparation 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>trimming visible fat from meat</li> 
<li>removing the skin and fat from poultry before cooking or serving (except 
for roasts)</li> 
<li>preparing lower fat vinaigrette dressings.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>11. </strong>&quot;Healthier&quot; cooking practices to reduce fat 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>routinely grilling, steaming, stir-frying or oven baking rather than 
frying or roasting with<br>
 added fat</li> 
<li>using spray oils</li> 
<li>dry frying or dry roasting spices</li> 
<li>skimming fat from the surfaces of liquids, including gravy, before serving
</li> 
<li>sweating onions in cling film (microwaveable) in a microwave instead of 
saut&eacute;ing them in oil</li> 
<li>avoid letting food sit in fat when roasting or oven cooking by roasting on 
a rack or trivet and grilling on a rack rather than a flat oven tray</li> 
<li>creating soups and sauces from pur&eacute;ed vegetables or reductions 
instead of roux thickenings</li> 
<li>not enriching with butter</li> 
<li>using a thin batter for fish or oven baking pre-coated products</li> 
<li>using a whisked sponge method or mix for puddings instead of the creamed 
method</li> 
<li>not tossing items (e.g. pasta) in butter but use a small amount of oil to 
prevent bulk quantities from sticking.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>12. </strong>In summary, the key to healthier catering is to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>make small but significant changes to best selling items</li> 
<li>increase the amount of starchy foods</li> 
<li>increase the amount of fruit and vegetables</li> 
<li>increase the fibre content of dishes where practical and acceptable</li> 
<li>reduce fat in traditional recipes</li> 
<li>change the type of fat used</li> 
<li>select healthier ways to prepare dishes</li> 
<li>be moderate in the use of sugar and salt.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>13. </strong>Key actions to achieve these goals are to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>make starchy foods (e.g. rice, pasta, bread, potatoes) a main part of most 
meals</li> 
<li>offer a good selection of fruit and incorporate it into dishes, where 
practical and acceptable</li> 
<li>offer fibre-rich varieties of bread and cereals</li> 
<li>include plenty of pulses and vegetables in dishes</li> 
<li>use lower fat cooking methods and ingredients</li> 
<li>reduce the amount and alter the types of fat used in food preparation</li> 
<li>use fewer fats that contain a high proportion of saturates by substituting 
these with fats and oils with a high content of unsaturates, where possible</li>
<li>use salt and salty foods in moderation</li> 
<li>use added sugar in moderation.</li> </ul>
