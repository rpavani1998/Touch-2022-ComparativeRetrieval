<p>Many people know which foods are essentially &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; and 
which are not.&nbsp; Far fewer consider the impact that food preparation has on 
the nutritional value of food&nbsp; and its implications for long term health.
</p> 
<p>When it comes to eating a healthy diet, in addition to making wise choices 
about which foods to eat, it is equally important to consider how best to cook 
them.&nbsp; The truth is, that certain cooking techniques (like steaming) are 
simply &ldquo;more healthy&rdquo; than others.&nbsp; It is also true that 
certain cookware (like iron, certified ceramics, enamel and glass) transfer 
fewer potentially harmful materials into the foods you cook using them.</p> 
<p>When you heat food in any type of pot or cookware, there is a tendency for 
the materials from which the pot is made to enter the food.&nbsp; Aluminum, 
iron, stainless steel, copper and ceramics are all popular materials for 
manufacturing cookware.&nbsp; When you cook using them, you inadvertently end 
up contaminating your food with small amounts of the material from which they 
are made.&nbsp; To minimize risks from cookware contamination, you should 
follow a few simple rules:</p> 
<p>- Don&rsquo;t store or cook foods for long periods in aluminum cookware<br>

 - Don&rsquo;t store highly acidic foods, like tomato-based sauces in any metal 
container<br>
 - Do not use ceramics, enamel, and glass containers unless they 
are certified<br>
 - Do not put any item or container in a microwave unless it 
is certified for such use<br>
 - Do not use silicone cookware at temperatures 
above 220&deg;C (428&deg;F)</p> 
<p>Additionally, the process one uses to cook a meal has a significant impact 
on the foods&rsquo; nutritional value.&nbsp; Fortunately for everyone, basic 
cooking techniques can be used to prepare food in the healthiest way possible. 
Not surprisingly, these are also the techniques that best facilitateweight loss.
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, one of the most popular food preparation techniques is deep 
frying. This technique requires cooking foods at high temperatures in 
fat.&nbsp; The list of potential health issues associated with preparing foods 
in this manner is long.&nbsp; Issues range from destruction of food nutrients, 
to adding unhealthy saturated fats and cholesterol, to exposure to cancer 
causing agents such as acrylamide and increased risks for weight gain and heart 
disease.&nbsp; Do yourself a favor.&nbsp; Stop eating deep-fried foods. There 
are more healthy preparation alternatives.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One popular alternative technique is grilling. It does not require that any 
type of oil be used, thus it avoids adding extra and unwanted fat.&nbsp; While 
grilling is seen as a healthy alternative to frying, it should still be 
practiced with caution. There are certain side effects, such as an increased 
risk in developing colon and lung cancer, associated with eating grilled foods, 
especially in red meats. It&rsquo;s important to observe safe grilling methods 
to minimize them. You should avoid eating burnt or charred meat, as they 
contain carcinogens that exacerbate cancer risks.</p> 
<p>Boiling is also a widely recognized diet-friendly cooking technique. 
Similarly, it eliminates the use of oil in the cooking process, replacing it 
with water.</p> 
<p>According to American author and physician Dr. Andrew Weil, MD, he prefers 
to steam and boil vegetables.&nbsp; &ldquo;I steam many of the vegetables I 
cook in my own kitchen, such as snow and snap peas, greens and artichokes. 
Steaming uses little energy, creates a minimum of mess and does the least 
damage to the nutrients in vegetables,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>But when it comes to vegetables with thicker surfaces such as corn on the 
cob and potatoes, he tends to put them in the boiler. He warns, however, that 
&ldquo;boiling tender vegetables will result in the loss of some of their 
nutrients in the cooking water.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As far as healthy cooking is concerned, steaming is found to be the most 
ideal technique of all. According to a study published in the Journal of the 
Science of Food and Agriculture, steaming has the highest rate of nutrient 
retention in foods compared to other healthy methods.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>An article titled <em>Why Steaming Vegetables is Healthier Than Boiling</em>
 by registered dietitian Janel Ovrut, MS RD has also confirmed this.</p> 
<p>Posted on the My Family Doctor website, Ovrut believes that vegetables, in 
general, will be reduced of some of its naturalvitamins when it is boiled 
rather than steamed. &ldquo;Many of the nutrients in vegetables can leach into 
the water when boiled. And the longer the vegetables are cooked, the more 
nutritional value is lost,&rdquo; she explained.</p> 
<p>Ovrut does offer a tip to those who favor boiling vegetables. &ldquo;Get 
back those leached nutrients by using the water in a soup, sauce or 
stew,&rdquo; she advised.</p> 
<p>All the techniques listed above best seal the flavor and preserve the 
foods&rsquo; nutritional value, minus the excessive amounts of fat or salt 
commonly used to prepare typical American dishes. Delicious and satisfying 
meals without the guilt are always a perfect match for a healthy and 
well-balanced diet.</p> <br>

<p>Ugh. It&rsquo;s pretty disgusting to know that every meal we eat has a 
little bit of the &ldquo;pan&rdquo; in it. I guess it&rsquo;s no different than 
knowing that indigenous peoples who grind grain with stone implements wear down 
their teeth due to the small bits of stone and sand that ends up in the meal. 
Thanks for the reminder! I&rsquo;m going to upgrade my cookware to certified 
ceramics and glass with glazes that have NO harmful additives like 
pigmentation, lead and such. Why? Because my wife and kids eat three meals a 
day at home. That&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;pan impurities&rdquo; over the course 
of a decade or two </p> </li>

<p>This is all good stuff. I&rsquo;m glad to see an article like this 
validating what I&rsquo;ve been practicing for quite some time now. I always 
steam my veggies (which I love to eat with brown rice) and when I have to boil 
them, I save the water to make into a healthy stew. No nutrients go to waste!

<p>My husband and I have made a few simple changes over the last 3 years and 
both of us are 50 pounds lighter. I would like to share that we no longer fry 
but bake, broil and grill. We have swapped out our white potatoes for sweet 
potatoes because they are higher on the glycemic index and it takes your body 
longer to burn them. We try to concentrate on eating a rainbow of vegetables 
and fruits daily It seems to me that it&rsquo;s not just that you eat healthy. 
I believe that our bodies require supplementation for proper functionality.</p>

<p>This is interesting, good to know that some cookwares cause some harm to 
foods that we cooked.. I never cared on choosing what type of cookware should I 
use before.. I should be more cautious now.</p> </li> </ol>
