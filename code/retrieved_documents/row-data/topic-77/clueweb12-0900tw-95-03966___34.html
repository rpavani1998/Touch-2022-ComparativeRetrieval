<h1>How To Eat Healthy In College</h1> Posted on March 15, 2012 by Lindsay <br>
<p>Last week I had the amazing opportunity to give a little presentation for 
the ladies ofCHAARG. Elizabeth &amp; Emily are fellow Fitfluential Ambassadors 
and the founders of this amazing group.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Aren&rsquo;t they adorable?!</p> 
<p>So, what&rsquo;s CHAARG? It stands for Changing Healthy, Attitudes &amp; 
Actions to Recreate Girls.</p> 
<p>From their website:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Is that awesome or what?! I was so honored when they asked me to come speak 
to their group! They pretty much gave me free reign, so I spent some time 
really thinking about what I wanted to talk to them about.</p> 
<p>Eventually, I decided to give a talk that I wish someone would have given 
me when I was in college. I wanted to cover the basics of healthy eating, give 
them lots of ideas and inspiration, and show them that what a wide variety of 
food you can prepare, even if you&rsquo;re living in a dorm room. I figured 
this would appeal to the masses because if these things can be made in a dorm 
room, with minimal equipment and a mini-fridge, then they can definitely be 
made in homes and apartments with even more space and equipment.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Pin It<br>
</p> 
<p>So, the evening went really well. The girls were so much fun! We rented a 
room in the union on campus and spent about an hour and a half chatting and 
whipping up some tasty snacks!</p> 
<p>I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to share my presentation with you guys!</p> 
<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2> 
<p>I told them about myself and about how when I went to college the first 
time, we had to live on campus all 4 years. We only had apartments for our 
senior year. That means I spent 3 years living in the dorms. I just WISH I had 
thought about making about making some of these snacks when I lived on campus, 
instead of living on cereal and easy mac for 3 years, or that I had thought to 
stock my mini fridge with something besides party supplies.</p> 
<h2><strong>Equipment</strong></h2> 
<p>Microwave- most dorms have one<br>
 Mini food processor- $20-30<br>
 
Toaster- $20<br>
 Mini Blender- $30<br>
 Can opener<br>
 Mason jars/Tupperware
<br> Knife &amp; cutting board<br>
 Measuring cups<br>
 Dishes</p> 
<h2><strong>Shape Your Plate</strong></h2> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Grains</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Hot oats</strong>:&nbsp;Microwave &frac12; c oats, 2/3 c water for 
2 minutes. Top with 6 oz plain greek yogurt, &frac14; c granola, 1 Tbsp chia 
seeds and 1 medium apple diced and you have a breakfast packed with 20 g fiber, 
26 g protein</li> 
<li><strong>Overnight</strong> <strong>oats</strong>- Mix oats, milk, fruit, 
chia seeds and nut butter. Let sit overnight. Grab &amp; Go in the morning</li> 
<li><strong><strong>Powercakes-</strong></strong>I introduced them to this 
easy meal from another FFA,Kasey @ Powercakes! They take&nbsp;8-9 minutes in 
the microwave and use oats, applesauce, egg whites, flaxseed, cinnamon, vanilla 
and add-ins like berries and cocoa powder. Kasey has tons of different 
variations up on her blog!Click here to check them out.</li>

<p>After I finished talking, we moved on to the fun part! Making the food. 
Earlier in the week, I sent over a list of some ingredients I would need them 
to pick up, and on the day of the presentation, I packed up a few of the 
ingredients I already had on hand (like tahini and brown rice syrup) and showed 
the girls how to make 4 easy snacks.</p>

<p>There you go! It IS possible to eat healthy in college, even when

take a little extra effort/planning/mini-fridge organization skills&hellip;but 
MAN i wish i would have done it </p> 
<p>So let&rsquo;s hear it. How was your diet in college?</p>

<p>My diet in college varied. Freshman year, I was clueless and ate pretty 
unhealthy foods. Summer after freshman year, I started counting calories and 
would only eat about 1200 calories a day (horrible, in my opinion) and those 
calories were usually from things like TV dinners and pudding snacks.</p> 
<p>Finally junior year, I started doing more research and feeding my body 
properly. Then I went super-healthy (like many of you super-healthy bloggers!), 
but honestly, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy eating that healthy either haha. I think 
I&rsquo;ve finally found a balance that seems to work for me!<br>

<p>great post! I needed this one BADLY the first couple years of college. My 
diet was oh so awful and consisted mainly of overly processed snacks (think 
oreos, Doritos, poptarts, you name it) and fast-food (late night Sonic or Taco 
Bells runs became almost a nightly routine freshman year) &hellip;. I hang my 
head<br>

<p>This is awesome! I lived in the dorms for two years and sometimes you just 
get tired of dining hall food! The hardest part is not overeating. My school 
gave us so many choices and it was all you could eat! Great advice for those 
currently living in dorms, or even if you aren&rsquo;t and are new to cooking!

<p>Wow, this would have been SO useful to me &mdash; those girls are lucky to 
have had your presentation! These are great solutions and better options than 
the cereal I lived off of my freshman year. It was after I gained the dreaded 
freshman 15 that I first started seeking information on nutrition, diet, 
exercise&ndash;anything to help me return to my former shape. Fortunately, this 
sparked more than just a weight loss effort; I learned the ins and outs of 
nutrition and found that I really enjoy exercise, so today I&rsquo;m more 
healthy and fit than ever before.<br>
 (But still would have loved to have 
avoided it all with your helpful tips and recipes, here!)<br>

with more than easy mac, juice boxes and cheez-its. Then again, my metabolism 
was COMPLETELY different then than it is now But at least now I&rsquo;m eating 
healthier! Better late than never. These are great tips for young people every

<p>What an amazing opportunity! Sounds like you provided some great 
recipe/meal ideas! I totally wish I would have had that in 
college&ndash;especially the years I was living on campus. My freshman year of 
college I gained quite a bit of weight&ndash;having a daily breakfast of banana 
bread + a white chocolate mocha probably didn&rsquo;t do me any favors. lol. 
Then my sophomore year, my disordered eating habits began. Pretty much all over 
the board in college.<br>

<p>Great post for those stuck in dorms. I wasn&rsquo;t super aware of 
nutrition in college, I ate healthier than my friends for sure but I 
didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing like now. I didn&rsquo;t live on campus but 
always brought my lunch since I&rsquo;d been doing that since kindergarten I 
think there&rsquo;s a big difference even since when I was in college to now 
where universities really try to make healthier options a priority on campus. I 
wish we could do it for the little kids more but at least it seems like 
it&rsquo;s catching on somewhere.</p> Reply <br>

<p>loved this post, especially because i&rsquo;m heading off to college next 
year! only bummer is, the place i&rsquo;m hoping to go doesn&rsquo;t allow any 
sort of appliance in your dorm room except for the fridge &amp; microwave that 
they approve. guess i&rsquo;m going to have to get creative! i&rsquo;m hoping 
to get the meal plan with the fewest meals and then make the rest of the meals 
myself &ndash; most likely i&rsquo;ll be making breakfast.<br>

<p>wow, linds! what a great presentation. </p> 
<p>my diet was ok in college. i definitely had my fair share of late night 
quesadillas or hungover greasy breakfast burritos, but for most breakfast, 
lunches, and dinners, i took advantage of the salad station or stir-fry station 
in our food court to customize my own veggie-filled meals!<br>

<p>LOVE this!! Such a great message to be sending to college girls all over 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s like an epidemic, I swear &ndash; so many women in college 
go into it having no clue how to eat properly and end up gaining the freshman 
15 and then some. It&rsquo;s sad, really. I have to say &mdash; I sort of fell 
into that camp a little bit, though I was at least working out then, I 
definitely wasn&rsquo;t eating well (as in wholesome, real, fueling foods). I 
have learned SO MUCH since that time &ndash; and really wish I had someone like 
you over my shoulder back then to set me straight. Great post!<br>

Luckily the salad bar was respectable! I don&rsquo;t think I got any knives or 
cutting boards until I moved into my first apartment, and I didn&rsquo;t really 
cook all that much until I got married. haha I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing 
I&rsquo;ve always been good about haphazardly slapping healthy stuff together.

<p>Yay! I was looking forward to your post about this. I need them to come get 
MY fitness routine &ldquo;in shape&rdquo; (literally&hellip;heeheehee). I LOVE 
this so much&hellip;now, if only I taught seniors in high school, I&rsquo;d be 
able to utilize it in health class.<br>

<p>My diet was pretty good. I ate lots of walnuts, raisins, milk, fruit, and 
granola bars I kept in my room. I ate mostly HUGE salads and wraps using my 
meal plan for dinners. There was some cereal and mac n cheese thrown in there 
as well but I&rsquo;d say I did better than average for sure (well if you 
don&rsquo;t count the unhealthy amounts of liquor)<br>

<p>Love this!!! I totally wish I would have had this in college. Although, I 
will say I think I did a fairly decent job- at least better than a lot of other 
people haha. Plus, Miami was great because they had so many healthy options to 
chose from!<br>

<p>The first semester of college, my diet was poor. Then my second semester is 
when I decided it was time to get healthy (I was also at my heighest weight 
ever at this point). So I started making healthy switches (grilled chicken 
instead of chicken tenders; less salad dressing, more lettuce; etc.). Since we 
had an a la carte meal plan at Baldwin-Wallace, I had to pay for everything 
thing I ate, so the want to spend less money also helped. Don&rsquo;t worry, I 
didn&rsquo;t go poor or hungry, but I did lose weight with little switches!<br>

<p>I lived off cereal, fruit and pb and j sandwiches! The dining hall food was 
just not that good at my school, so I basically lived off snacks! I felt 
sluggish a lot of the time which was not a good feeling! Luckily, during my 
last two years I moved home, so my nutritious meals got back on track in no 
time! </p> Reply <br>

<p>This is great! I would have loved something like this when I went to 
college. Even though I lived at home for 75% of my college career &hellip; I 
fell victim to the late night crunch sessions at school or would spend 14 hour 
days making sure my assigments juuuust right. So I ate a lot, and I mean A LOT, 
of ramen. SO easy to sneak in my backpack, and also to snack on when I got home 
from a long school day. I was the Sodium Queen<br>
