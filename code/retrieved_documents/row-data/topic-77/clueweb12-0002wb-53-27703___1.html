 There's a lot of bread in our 
freezer. In our exuberance, we often bake more bread than we can eat in a day 
or two. What isn't given away goes in the freezer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Sometimes, we bake bread just to store. It's wonderful to have homemade bread 
on hand for those periods when we're just too busy to bake. And it's always a 
good feeling to have bread on hand for an emergency.<br>
<br>
<br>

ever seen<br>
<br>
 There are three ways to use bread from your freezer. Most 
commonly, the freezer is raided for that special bread (like Canadian Cheese 
Bread) for a sandwich or for fresh homemade bread for breakfast toast. To 
accommodate those raids, we keep lots of sliced bread in the freezer. A slice 
or two of bread is snapped from the frozen loaf and dropped in the toaster 
while the remaining loaf goes back to the freezer. As long as you don't mind 
toasted bread for your sandwich, an array of breads are available for breakfast 
or sandwiches. This way, each kid gets to choose the bread that he or she wants.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
 Bread can be removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw 
on the counter. Use it within a day or so just like you would fresh bread.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
 Frozen bread can also be reheated and recharged in the 
oven. Defrost the bread completely on the counter then reheat it in the oven 
for ten minutes at the same temperature at which it was baked.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> bread-cutThe secret for quality bread from your freezer is starting with 
the freshest loaves possible. If you freeze the bread as soon as it is 
completely cooled, it will taste as if it came from the oven when thawed.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
 To freeze bread?sliced or unsliced?place it in a plastic bag 
with the excess air pressed out. For longer storage, cover the plastic bag with 
aluminum foil. Since air will slowly migrate through the walls of a plastic 
bag, plastic alone will work for only a month or two (heavier, freezer-type 
bags will help). If frozen in foil or freezer wrap, bread can be stored for 
three or four months and still maintain top quality. Mark all bread going into 
your freezer with the date and the type of bread to be sure that you can tell 
the difference between Old Wisconsin Cheddar Bread and Sour Cream Onion Bread.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
 Place the new loaves behind the loaves already in the 
freezer to help rotate stocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 By the way, never 
refrigerate bread. Bread will stale faster in the refrigerator than on the 
counter.<br>
