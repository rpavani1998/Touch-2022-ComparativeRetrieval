<b>Question: </b>How Can I Tell 
if a Recipe is Healthy? <i>I like to cook and I have lots of recipe books, but 
I'm not sure which recipes are good for a healthy diet. Like I know I need to 
eat more vegetables, but what if I cook them in such a way they're not good for 
me anymore? Can you help?</i> 
<p><i>Alex -- About.com User</i></p> <b>Answer: </b>When I am researching 
recipes, there are three main characteristics I look for:
<ul> 
<li>The inclusion of healthy ingredients</li> 
<li>The exclusion of unhealthy ingredients</li> 
<li>The cooking method</li> </ul>Here is what you should look for when 
evaluating a recipe.
<h3>Healthy Ingredients</h3>The best ingredients are whole fresh or frozen 
fruits and vegetables, healthy oils like olive oil, walnut oil, grape seed oil, 
and rice bran oil. Nuts, legumes and soy are healthy ingredients, and so are 
whole grain breads, and pastas. Meats and poultry should be lean whenever 
possible, and low fat dairy products are good too. I like recipes that include 
several healthy ingredients, rather than just one or two. For example,<b>Wild 
Rice with Cranberries and Apples</b> is a great healthy dish with a great 
balance of whole grains, nuts, and fruit. Serve this with a lean chicken breast 
for an incredibly tasty and healthy meal.<b>Pork with Cabbage and Apples</b> is 
another example of a great recipe with several healthy ingredients.
<h3>Leave Out Unhealthy Ingredients</h3>Unhealthy ingredients include sugar, 
processed foods, saturated andtrans fat, white refined flour, and products made 
with refined white flour. Evaluating a recipe can be easy. For example, a 
recipe that calls for processed foods like luncheon meats, processed 
cheese-products or high fat products like mayonnaise isn't healthy and should 
not become a recipe you use very often.
<p>Sometimes evaluating a recipe is more difficult. Spaghetti and meatballs 
seems like a healthy meal, but a large portion of the meal is pasta made from 
refined white flour and the meatballs may have a lot ofsaturated fat in them. 
On the flip side, the spaghetti sauce itself is very healthy with lots of
tomatoes that give us vitamins and lycopene. Garlic, peppers, herbs seasonings 
and mushrooms are healthy ingredients you might find in a spaghetti recipe.</p> 
<p>When you find a recipe that confuses you, just alter the recipe a bit. Make 
your meatballs from ground turkey meat and use a whole grain pasta, or decrease 
the serving size and add a big salad on the side.</p> 
<h3>Cooking Methods</h3>The cooking method used in a recipe is very important. 
Deep-frying is probably the least healthy of the cooking methods, especially if 
the oil is used more than once. Pan frying might be a little better, but still 
not so good if you use a lot of oil and batters on your foods that absorb a lot 
of oil. Sauteing in a bit of olive oil orcanola oil is better, and roasting in 
an oven is better yet. Boiling vegetables will not add any extra calories, but 
you will loose some of the valuable nutrients when you drain off the cooking 
water. Microwaving is a great way to cook vegetables because it is quick so not 
many nutrients are lost.
<p>Here are a couple examples of recipes prepared with different methods. 
Potatoes are a nice source of vitamin C and fiber if you leave on the skins. A 
medium sizedbaked potato only has about 100 calories and is a healthy food when 
cooked in this manner. A french-fried potato is not so healthy. The fat used to 
deep-fry the potato is not healthy, and the potato absorbs a lot of oil, so the 
same size potato that is french fried has many more calories and fat. If you 
like french fries, try slicing the potato into strips and lightly coat the 
strips with olive oil. Bake them on a baking sheet until they are tender.</p> 
<p>Another example of good verses bad cooking methods would be this example 
with a chicken breast. Baking a chicken breast in the oven with some salsa or 
chicken broth is a healthy way to prepare the chicken. If you take that same 
chicken breast, coat it with a batter and deep fry it, that piece of chicken 
becomes an unhealthy, fattening food.</p> 
<p>Always look for healthy ingredients. Avoid unhealthy ingredients or find 
healthier substitutes. Choose recipes that let you bake, roast, microwave or 
saute your foods.</p> <br>
