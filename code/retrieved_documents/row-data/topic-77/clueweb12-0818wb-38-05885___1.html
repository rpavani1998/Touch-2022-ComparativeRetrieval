 Mmmmm, processed foods from Kraft Food and Family. There are some 
shortcuts I like &ndash; using salad dressing instead of oil to pan fry things 
in &ndash; that I picked up from KF&amp;F, but some like using Cream of Blah 
soup, I wish I had never heard of. It&rsquo;s not that I want to make my life 
harder. It&rsquo;s that I want to make my life healthier and I can&rsquo;t 
imagine that ingesting a bunch of chemicals I can&rsquo;t pronouce is going to 
make my life healthier, even if they are the &ldquo;Healthy Request&rdquo; or 
whatever it is called versions. Same with stuffing . . . but that is such a 
guilty pleasure of mine. Yeah, I never quite could hang to the Atkins/ Low Carb 
idea . . . I love carbs, waaaaaay too much. Which is why I hope adopting more 
Asian styles in my life will help. More carbs than a low carb diet, but less 
food overall.<br>
<br>
 Anyways. I think I may watch my DVRed copy of Good 
Eats&rsquo; casserole show and revamp this. It tasted pretty good, but was 
mostly a way to use up some of the frozen leftover ham, and take advantage of a 
sale on yummy spring asparagus. It doesn&rsquo;t make much economic sense to 
use $0.99/lb leftover ham, $1.47/lb asparagus, and then a $2 box of stuffing 
and a $2 can of soup . . . And I would definitely pack it a little tighter. 
This recipe made it so loose that it was kinda spoonable, with no structural 
integrity at all. But here&rsquo;s the original recipe:<br>
<br>
Swiss Cheese, 
Ham, and Asparagus Bake</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 pkg. (6 oz.) STOVE TOP Stuffing Mix for Chicken</li> 
<li>3 cups cubed cooked ham</li> 
<li>18 fresh asparagus spears (about 1/2 lb.), cut into 2-inch pieces</li> 
<li>1 can (10-3/4 oz.) condensed cream of celery soup</li> 
<li>1/2 cup milk</li> 
<li>1 cup KRAFT Shredded Swiss Cheese</li> </ul> 
<p> PREHEAT oven to 350&deg;F. Add 1-1/2 cups hot water to stuffing mix in 
medium bowl; stir just until moistened. Let stand 5 min.<br>
 MIX ham, 
asparagus, soup and milk in 13&times;9-inch baking dish; sprinkle with cheese. 
Top with stuffing.<br>
 BAKE 30 min. or until heated through and golden brown 
on top.<br>
<br>
 It was nice having a minimum of dishes to do last night, 
though. I served this with a green salad and Mac and Cheese &ndash; yes, the 
nuclear orange kind, I&rsquo;m trying, damn it! I bought two boxes after not 
buying any for months! And if DD had her way, she would eat it morning, noon, 
and night. And this is the only kind I actually like the taste of. The 
interesting thing is that there was actually enough leftover to have some in 
everyone&rsquo;s bento for today! </p>
