<h2>When The Macaroon Meets The Macaron, It Means I&rsquo;m Back</h2> 
<p>Posted on 13 October 2011. </p> 
<p>I would bet a hundred dollars that when my friends and family see this, 
they won&rsquo;t actually believe they&rsquo;re reading<em>something new</em> 
on my site. Most of them have given up asking me about it. [I won't name any 
names... Ha ha.]</p> 
<p>The past summer, <strong>Shulie</strong>, asked me if I would be interested 
in contributing to the<strong>tree nut-free macaron series</strong> she&rsquo;s 
hosting on her website,<strong>Food Wanderings</strong>. I immediately replied 
that of course, I would, but admitting that realistically it probably 
won&rsquo;t be until Fall that I can commit to it. She assured me that October 
would be fine.<em>Super. [Thanks so much, Shulie!]<br>
</em></p> 
<p>Fast forward to our Thanksgiving month here in Canada. I managed to whip up 
a few batches of macarons to test, including my worst macaron experiment to 
date &mdash; it never even made it to the parchment paper. I found a workaround 
so that I still had my craving for toasted coconuts satisfied in macaron form. 
Because I like to humour myself, I made a very macaroon-ish macaron, that still 
tasted like the macaroon, but not quite. It&rsquo;s still a macaron. Am I 
confusing you?</p> 
<p>Coconut Macaron with White Chocolate and Lime Ganache</p>

</strong>&lsquo;s and find out what I used to naturally color the white 
chocolate ganache. If you&rsquo;re allergic to tree nuts like her son,

<h2>Chili Con Coco Loco | Asian Style Beef Chili with Garlic Fried Rice</h2> 
<p>Posted on 01 February 2011. </p> 
<p>And so it is, the first month of the year is almost over. The <em>newness
</em> of 2011 has worn out and although the thrill ride of the holidays is 
definitely tucked beneath shadows of gift wrappers past, I couldn&rsquo;t be 
more excited to finally let you know what&rsquo;s been cooking up in my kitchen!
<strong>Casey</strong>, the talented force behind <strong>Kitchen Play</strong>
, organizes monthly events that bring bloggers and PR professionals together 
&mdash; in the name of food and all things food-related. Several weeks ago she 
informed me there will be an<strong>all-Canadian Kitchen Play event</strong>
&hellip;<em>and would I want to join?</em> Uhm, <em>yes!</em></p> 
<p>I was curious to find out which company or organization we will be working 
with and what &ldquo;secret ingredient&rdquo; participants will be asked to use 
for the recipes. My anxiousness beefed up (hah!) while I waited for more 
details from Casey. A few days later, she revealed that we would be sponsored 
by no other than<em>the</em> <strong>Canadian Beef (www.beefinfo.org)</strong>. 
Smile.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em><strong>Would you like to &ldquo;play&rdquo; along with us in the 
kitchen? </strong></em><br>
<em><strong> <br>

month&rsquo;s Kitchen Play &mdash; go crazy and put your own twist!&ndash; for 
a chance to win $100 from Canadian Beef. So what are you waiting for?</strong> 
(Please refer to the completecontest rules.)</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>I love beef.</strong> I love my steaks. Ribs. Even offal. <strong>
My assignment was to create an original entree recipe using, yes, beef!</strong>
Wheels started turning and one of my initial recipes consisted of tender cuts, 
but quite expensive. After testing it,&nbsp; I realized that won&rsquo;t fly on 
a regular weekday meal; not even on a weekend. The truth is, I would have filet 
mignon with salt and pepper cooked medium rare with some sizzling butter and 
sauteed mushrooms on a regular basis . I&rsquo;ll also take grilled 
wine-marinated top blade steaks. Given a good quality piece of meat, I will 
just let its amazing flavor and texture dazzle me. However, this is not the 
time to go down the beaten path and there is definitely more to beef than 
grilling steaks! I wanted to create something that&rsquo;s different from the 
norm, but still hopefully a dish that everyone can enjoy.</p> 
<p>Heather (Travis), the <em>Beef Information Center</em>&lsquo;s director of 
Public Relations, told me that they are open to any and all ideas. I like that. 
If you know me,<em>I will go there.</em> After experimenting with one idea 
after another, and eating one mistake after another (yes, I end up with 
disappointing meals, too!), I took several deep breaths&hellip; Beef is hearty. 
It&rsquo;s filling. When done right, it makes a world of difference between<em>
blah</em> meat and a cleaned out plate that begs for more. I wanted that 
feeling from my dish. It&rsquo;s odd how recipes start out in my head. For this 
main course, the goal was to get that feeling of eating something so good you 
sit back and unconsciously rub your belly out of happiness and satisfaction. 
Plus, it&rsquo;s winter, so I was looking for that element of heat. Soup. 
Spice. To keep the cold away.</p> 
<p><strong>I decided on some chili. But what can I do to it?</strong> I sure 
love the different textures when I make it with ground meat and chunks to chew 
on, and the heartiness a good chili brings. However, given my Asian roots and 
upbringing, I still admittedly look for flavors of home:<em><strong>coconuts, 
coconut milk, lime</strong> (in the Philippines we have a citrus called<strong> 
calamansi</strong>)&hellip;</em></p> 
<p>So. <strong>What if?</strong></p> 
<p>This isn't your usual chili.</p> 
<p><strong>What if, with careful manipulation of the ingredients, I can make 
this North American favorite with an Asian twist? Do I go there? Do I dare put 
coconut milk in my chili?</strong><strong> <em>Yes, yes yes!</em></strong></p> 
<p>Beef goes really well with coconut milk, which goes hand in hand with 
chili. How about a double kick from chipotle chili and sriracha? The flavor is 
full, but I didn&rsquo;t like the taste to lose its novelty, so let&rsquo;s add 
a burst of freshness from cilantro.</p> 
<p>A spritz of lime.</p> 
<p>Finish it off with warm garlic rice. I would go so far as to eat it with 
coconut garlic rice. Wow.</p> 
<p>Rinse, repeat.</p> 
<p>Was that a <strong>Chili con Coco? Chili con Coco Loco?</strong></p> 
<p>A creamy and refreshing hearty chili. Who knew?</p> 
<p>Ooh, and what is that something else you taste? You can&rsquo;t really 
figure it out, but it&rsquo;s there.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll just have to scroll 
down and check the recipe! There are a couple of things you might not expect in 
this chili, but trust me, they make it so good. :-)<br>
<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>As I sit back and relax, and enjoy a full belly of chili goodness, 
I hope you&rsquo;ll try it. It&rsquo;s now my new favorite chili.</strong></p> 
<p>Thank you again to our sponsor, <strong>Canadian Beef</strong>, and <strong>
Kitchen Play</strong> for letting us &ldquo;play&rdquo; in the kitchen to bring 
you new ways to enjoy beef in your meals. And don&rsquo;t forget,<strong>you

<h2>Linguine with Braised Chard and Prosciutto</h2> 
<p>Posted on 28 January 2011. </p> 
<p>After a busy day, there&rsquo;s nothing more that I want than <em>fast food.
</em> Not the McD kind or the pizza kind. I want something I could fix ASAP 
without having to fret over ingredients I&rsquo;m missing. You must think I 
just bake and eat baked goods all the time with everything that I&rsquo;ve been 
posting lately, but I still do cook. I want to spend my time in the kitchen 
wisely (=quickly), making something that&rsquo;s good enough to eat and enjoy, 
but still healthy. I mean, cutting out the part where I drink wine is eating 
healthier, right? Aha.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There were still fresh pasta and prosciutto from my last trip to Granville 
Island, and a bunch of almost- forgotten Swiss chard that commanded attention 
or they will take a direct trip to the food scrap recycling bin. And then 
there&rsquo;s the leftover ricotta from my crumb cake baking, plus a lonely 
shallot bulb.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not organized enough to have my market loot 
assigned into dishes and menus, so this is a regular plight:<em><strong>Get 
available and/or in-season ingredients and figure it out in the kitchen later.
</strong></em> The pantry and fridge supplies my cooking notes, and sometimes 
we orchestrate some magic. This one will be added to my pile of go-to quick 
food, with the greens adapted to what&rsquo;s in season or easily available.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>Simple food can be satisfying, you just have to be willing to try. And 
don&rsquo;t forget to check what you already have in your kitchen. Yes, that is 
a lesson for myself as well.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re into Swiss chard, check this other recipe, too: <strong>
Eggplant &amp; Chard Lasagne</strong>. It&rsquo;s a vegetarian dish that has a 
good chance of winning the meat lovers over. :)</p>

<h2>Fuss Free Fridays: Steak with Green Peppers</h2> 
<p>Posted on 19 November 2010. </p> 
<p>I foresee simple meals until the end of Christmas.</p> 
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ll tell you why: I&rsquo;ve wanted to be able to make all 
the gifts I&rsquo;ll be giving for Christmas for the longest time and I<em>think
</em> this year it&rsquo;s finally going to happen.</strong> [Right, I could be 
crazy.] Of course, whenever I make that decision, things happen. However, 
I&rsquo;m going to tough it out and fight my odds through the years. I&rsquo;ll 
be sewing and baking like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s only this year that I really appreciated the fact that the 
Canadian Thanksgiving is in October, I have to say. It really does give me more 
time to prepare for Christmas, even though I&rsquo;m still trying to catch my 
breath and hoping I make all my deadlines.</p> 
<p>When I was in the midst of my cross-stitching frenzy, I cooked this quick 
stir-fry of sliced steak with green peppers and onions, eaten over a steaming 
bed of rice.</p> 
<p>Heaven for the weary.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Anyway, back to the dish. This is easy to make, and you don&rsquo;t really 
need a recipe. So below is a &ldquo;guideline&rdquo; to create your own recipe. 
It&rsquo;s something you can put together with whatever you have. :)</p> 
<p>Sorry, this is short and sweet, BUT I promise you: <strong>Donuts this 
weekend!</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>STEAK STRIPS, PEPPER AND ONION STIR-FRY<br>
</strong><em>Serves 2 
to 3</em></p> 
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>19 0z of steak</li> 
<li>1/2 green pepper, sliced into thin strips</li> 
<li>1 tsp oil</li> 
<li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li> 
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li> 
<li>1/8 teaspoon ground pepper</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p> 
<p>1. Heat oil on medium high and saute peppers for 2 mins. Transfer to a 
plate.</p> 
<p>2. Place onions in the pan and cook for 1 minute and put on another plate.
</p> 
<p>3. Heat garlic and meat sprinkled with salt and pepper. Turn occasionally 
and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until all the liquid from the meat is almost 
gone.</p> 
<p>4. Add back the pepper and onions and toss with the meat for a few seconds 
before transferring onto a serving plate. Enjoy with some pita bread or place 
over a bed of fresh steamed rice.</p>

<h2>The Mummy Diaries, Part 2: Baked Sweet Booh!tatoes</h2> 
<p>Posted on 29 October 2010. </p> 
<p>And I&rsquo;m back for more #GreatHallowTweet. BOO!!! Do check out my 
fellow ghoulish frighteners in crime on the left sidebar (look for the 
pumpkin!). Get some inspiration from them this Halloween season &mdash; trust 
me, they have lots of wonderful stuff for you!</p> 
<p>As for today here at Gourmeted, I bring you: <strong>Mummified Sweet 
Potatoes!</strong> Yes, it&rsquo;s all about the mummies. I love the <em>cute
</em> side of mummies. I love wrapping things, especially gifts. I like 
wrapping food in crunch. I like wrapping, period. Wrapping means surprises, and 
I sure do love those.</p> 
<p>Goodness, do I sound drunk from sweet potatoes? Perhaps.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This Halloween snack was borne out of necessity almost. Deep fried sweet 
potatoes with sugar were my favorite after-school snack, an indulgence I get 8 
times out of ten when I beg our helpers to make them forme us. When 
you&rsquo;re a kid, you get a lot of things for free, with a smile, too. These 
days, my taste buds (and hips) aren&rsquo;t too fond of deep fried, but the 
fact remains that I have never successfully baked sweet potato fries or wedges 
that are crispy on the outside as the deep fried goodness. They become limp 
faster than burn my mouth from fresh-out-of-the-oven sweet potatoes. [Never do 
that, promise me, please.]</p> 
<p>These were incredibly good and addicting. </p> 
<p><strong>Enter Phyllo Dough, which in my book, will always pack a crunch 
when you need it!</strong> You see, there&rsquo;s a bit of a phyllo-mena here 
in the household. I&rsquo;ve been on a filo kick lately because they are so 
darn handy with food, be it sweet or savory, snack or main meal. It&rsquo;s a 
perfectly sane idea to keep a box or two in the freezer, just as you would do 
for butter. What, you don&rsquo;t do that? :)</p> 
<p>This sweet and healthy snack is easy to do, <strong>all you need are: 
</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>1 medium sweet potato</strong></li> 
<li><strong>2 tablespoons of melted butter</strong></li> 
<li><strong>2 t0 3 tablespoons of brown or demerara sugar (depending on how 
sugary you want it to be)</strong></li> 
<li><strong>2 sheets of phyllo dough. for every medium size sweet potato
</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>You can double this recipe, just use the 2 butter, 2 (or 3) sugar 2 phyllo 
ratio and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p> 
<p>Oven is preheated to 400&deg;F and potato pieces are baked 10 minutes, 
turned, then baked for another 15 minutes. Easy enough, right? The construction 
is the tricky part, but I was able to do everything under an hour, including 
the baking time and even while shooting photos. Once you get into the groove, 
there&rsquo;s no stopping the mummy production line.</p> 
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how I did each piece:</strong></p> 
<p>Cut the sweet potato into wedges or a-little-fatter-than-fries size (half 
an inch x a quarter inch is perfect) and place in a bowl.</p> 
<p>Lightly brush half a sheet of phyllo dough with butter, fold, then butter 
the exteriors, and cut into 16 strips. Sprinkle or rub each strip with sugar.
</p> 
<p>Use the remaining butter to toss the wedges in.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Fold each phyllo strip in half, lengthwise, and wrap around each piece of 
sweet potato.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just tuck the beginning of the strip by overlapping after the first turn.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Tuck the end underneath the strip looping before it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just a little push would do. The tine of a fork could help, too. And there 
you have it, one mummy!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Place on a baking/cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And bake for 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 400&deg;F.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Turn each piece, exposing the caramel-y side and bake for another 15 
minutes.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>VOILA!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For bulkier pieces, wrap them twice with phyllo for that extra crunch and 
finger-food stability if you&rsquo;re serving it for a party.</p> 
<p>The good news is, the crunch of the phyllo stays for hours. Mmm!!!</p>

<h2>Mocha Cake ala Goldilocks</h2> 
<p>Posted on 13 October 2010. </p> 
<p><strong>Goldilocks</strong> is a well-known institution of baked goods and 
pastries in the Philippines. Even though I can easily go to their Vancouver 
location to get mymocha cake fix, I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of baking a copycat 
so I can enjoy it anytime at home and knowing the ingredients in the cake 
I&rsquo;m eating.</p> 
<p>Finally, this summer, I set out to do just that. I got insanely lucky on my 
first try of the series and the flavor and texture was<em>right on.</em> My 
family declared it identical to (and even better than) Goldilocks. It was too 
good to be true and I can tell you that I got teary eyed on the final tasting 
of the buttercream after tweaking the flavors. Just to be sure, I&rsquo;ve 
baked it numerous times since that first time. It helps that another batch of 
cake is requested before the current one gets eaten, so I don&rsquo;t have to 
bury my face in mocha cake. Hah! One cake is just not enough. In fact, 
I&rsquo;ve been asked not to post it on the blog because it really does taste 
like the real thing.&nbsp; However, what kind of food blogger am I if, after 
all the testing and perfecting, I don&rsquo;t share it? That pretty much 
defeats my purpose for this site.</p> 
<p>So here it is, one item off my To-Cook-and-Bake-From-Scratch list:</p> 
<p>This was my sister-in-law's birthday cake.</p> 
<p>The mocha cake from Goldilocks defined my love for cakes at an early age. 
What cake do I want for my birthday?<em>Goldilocks mocha cake please!</em></p> 
<p>Back in university, whenever I felt down, all I needed was a quick jeepney 
ride to<em>Philcoa</em> to order a half roll of mocha cake and &mdash; gasp 
&mdash; finish most of it myself. [Either that, or Betty's Sans Rival.] I was 
shameless and guiltless in my 5 foot frame and in the 90-pound mark then. These 
days, I don&rsquo;t want to think about that, but I still want to a slice of 
mocha cake or two with my cup of coffee.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The cake is light, fluffy, and soft, and the icing is a luscious 
combination of extra smooth coffee and cocoa, buttery but not greasy. To get 
the authentic taste, you will need to use<strong>Nescafe coffee granules
</strong>. You can also use espresso granules (= coffee taste is bolder and 
more pronounced) or Starbucks VIA Italian roast (=icing has bitter and sour 
notes), but it&rsquo;s up to you if you want to use what you have available. 
You will also need amaretto, an Italian almond liqueur to finish off the flavor 
and must not be skipped. I&rsquo;ve never tried to substitute it with anything, 
so I cannot advise you on that for now. I&rsquo;ll try making this with almond 
extract next time and see if that can be used!</p> 
<p>Please enjoy!</p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>The recipe can be made into a two-layer 9-inch round cake or a roll. 
I&rsquo;ve included instructions for the roll in the recipeNotes if you want to 
take a stab at it.</p>

<h2>Steel Cut Oats with Asparagus and the Merits of 
Uncomplicated-Yet-Still-Good Meals</h2> 
<p>Posted on 03 May 2010. </p> 
<p>Simple. Healthful. Delicious.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about <strong>sliced asparagus topped with fried 
pancetta, on a bed of steel cut oats</strong>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>Who needs a recipe for something as easy as that? </em></strong>
(Some do, if only for the methods, and I will happily oblige at the end of this 
post.)</p> 
<p><strong>People underestimate the value of their taste buds and instincts in 
the kitchen.</strong> I know that too well having been cooking-challenged for 
most of my life. I didn&rsquo;t even bother to cook, because I (and everyone 
else)<em>knew</em> I was incapable. I was the one family members would silently 
worry about because I had no interest in spending time in the kitchen. Part of 
the reason for that was because<strong>cooking was not only a <em>daunting chore
</em>, I was also afraid of the judgments to be made with the way I cook and 
the end product of my rare culinary attempt</strong>. The thought of cooking 
anything that does not provoke victorious gasps among meal partakers was just 
too much to bear.</p> 
<p>So what changed? As much as I cannot stand to watch Rachel Ray these days, 
I used to like her pre-pre-Oprah&hellip;in her<em>$40 A Day</em> days when 
extended cable was my friend. Then I caught a few episodes of 30-Minute Meals 
when it started, when I had Food Network on all day, like&hellip;<em>all day.
</em> Finally in September 2006, I found <strong>the very first recipe in my 
twenty-something adult life that, for some crazy reason, made me try cooking. 
It was..<em>drum roll&hellip;</em>Rachel Ray&rsquo;s &ldquo;You Won&rsquo;t Be 
Single For Long Vodka Cream Pasta&rdquo; </strong><em> [The name of the dish 
still make me cringe]</em>.<strong> </strong><em>Perhaps, I didn&rsquo;t have 
to hide under the kitchen sink when asked who wasted all the ingredients with 
that kind of cooking. It was actually quite good, now that I looked at my blog 
entry then (not here).</em>I enjoyed it so much that I cooked it again with 
linguine with sliced beef sausage and ham:</p> 
<p>Yes, this is the actual photo I took of the 2nd dish I cooked, back in 
October 2, 2006 (thanks to Flickr and my blog archive, I don't have to commit 
everything to memory). It's inspired by Rachel Ray's &quot;You Won't Be Single 
For Long Vodka Cream Pasta.&quot;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m much more confident in my cooking these days, and can make 
something out of whatever is available. The kitchen and I, we&rsquo;re like 
bread and butter now. Cooking and baking relax me, like meditative symphonies, 
and the outcome is something that others can enjoy&ndash;everyone&rsquo;s happy.
</p> 
<p><strong><em>Ms. I-Don&rsquo;t-Cook, I am no more. Good-bye to the days of 
subsisting solely on someone else&rsquo;s cooking, or making reservations for 
dinner so I can have my</em><em><em>cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e fix.</em></em>
</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Today, I&rsquo;m the one who misses cooking 
at home when I travel. I&rsquo;m the one gently encouraging to friends and 
family to try recipes, because cooking good food could be so very<em>easy AND 
delicious.</em> It doesn&rsquo;t take a magician or a day of labor.</p> 
<p><em>And it took Rachel Ray to inspire me to get out of my (non-cooking) 
shell.<br>
</em></p> 
<p>Recently, she and Jamie Oliver have been called out in this article as 
advertising and marketing &ldquo;<em>on behalf of the processed food industry.
</em>&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Jamie, for one, has promoted real food for the longest time. Both their 
recipes can be really quick, but they are a far cry from Hungry Man and Lean 
Cuisine dinners. Quick and easy meals may raise the eyebrows of food snobs, but 
the bottomline is:<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rachael Ray and Jamie Oliver bring people to the kitchen.</strong>
</p> 
<p>Jamie&rsquo;s Food Revolution has stirred interest in the school lunches of 
America, and the way people eat in general.<strong>People need to start 
somewhere, and if these two can bring people home from the takeout/drive-thru 
line and out with their pots in front of their stoves and to the dining tables, 
then so be it.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A lot of us in the online food blogging circles take the time to 
cook, because first and foremost,<em>we already love to cook.</em> </strong>I 
have to constantly remind myself when I write and post recipes that, not 
everyone is like me. It is so easy to get tunnel vision when you live a certain 
lifestyle, are comfortable, and have time to ruminate on the good things in 
life, or how you could be less busy to make meals, but&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>People do get busy. And tired. And lazy on some days. </strong>I 
don&rsquo;t have kids, I don&rsquo;t have any obligation to cook for anyone or 
attend to anyone, I work from home, and YET, there would still be days when I 
am just too swamped with work, too exhausted, and too famished to cook. I speed 
dial the pizza place. Or I take some French bread, slice some cheese, rinse 
some fruits, open a bottle of wine and call it Joy&rsquo;s Awesome Dinner. 
There would be week-long stove lulls in favor of eating out with friends and 
re-heating take-outs, meeting work deadlines or riding over the<em>lazy days. 
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had that.</em>I can&rsquo;t imagine what it must be 
like for parents who both work and have kids, and no sitter.</p> 
<p>And then,<strong> there are so many people who don&rsquo;t know where or 
how to begin cooking</strong>. And this could be for a variety of reasons: they 
never cooked, they don&rsquo;t like cooking, they couldn&rsquo;t care less 
about cooking, didn&rsquo;t grow up around people who cook, etc. I&nbsp; grew 
up with good food and family and household help who cook, and I was lucky 
enough to have learned the basics in school, and we even had meal-planning as 
part of our Home Economics subject. We even had to come up with our own recipe! 
It was a drag then, I admit. University was a cooking write-off, limited to a 
one-range stove to make breakfast, boil water for ramen, re-heat take-out, and 
make the occasional<em>leche flan.</em></p> 
<p>If you told me 5 years ago that I have to learn cooking for my own good, I 
would have brushed you off (and something worse that&rsquo;s for your 
imagination). I wouldn&rsquo;t see you eye to eye.<strong> Someone who loves to 
cook take joy in even talking about food, while someone who doesn&rsquo;t would 
think the food lover needs to shut up about the juicy, garden fresh tomatoes 
already.</strong>Try to feed someone some good, simple, home-cooked meals and 
at one point or another you could get a conversation going about how easy it is 
to make and they could make it, too.<em>It&rsquo;s a process.</em> You 
can&rsquo;t push it, but you&rsquo;ll just have to try and it&rsquo;s not a 
chore for you because it&rsquo;s something you love to do.</p> 
<p>I used to avoid cooking at all costs. I progressed from a kitchen miser 
because of an inspiration.<em> Oh, love! </em>My approach to food is romantic 
at its very core.<strong>I&rsquo;m not trying to make people cook or bake if 
they really don&rsquo;t want to. I would love for people to appreciate good 
food, if not love it. Food is not only physical nourishment, but a body of more 
than the sum of all its ingredients&ndash;with it comes conversation, momentous 
occasions, a time to pause and relax, a wink, a smile&hellip;<em>memories</em>!
</strong></p> 
<p>Of course, not every meal could bring butterflies in your stomach or be 
imprinted on your mind, but it can be enjoyed&hellip;alone, with company, to 
celebrate something, to banish a bad day, or seal a good one.<strong><em>Food 
can be that good. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated, such as 
Asparagus with Steel Cut Oats.</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Un-Recipe&rdquo; for 2 vegetarian loving 
eaters, or 3 to 4 people enjoying this as a side dish:<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>For the asparagus:</strong> Wash about 450 grams of medium 
asparagus spears to make 2 cups, sliced. Slice diagonally, about a third to a 
quarter of a centimeter in thickness. In medium heat, melt a tablespoon of 
unsalted butter in a large frying pan until froth starts to turn brown. Saute 
asparagus for a few minutes until the bottom of the pan is almost dry. Add a 
tablespoon of water and allow to steam. Add 3 more, evaporating in between 
additions. Add salt and pepper to taste. Eat as is, with rice, quinoa, or with 
cooked steel cut oats and top with some fried-till-crisp pancetta or bacon for 
flavor.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Cooking steel cut oats </strong>(also called Irish or coarse-cut 
oats)<strong> as a stand-in for rice:</strong> Place 1/2 cup of steel cut oats 
with 1 cup of water in a small pot and cook in med-high heat. Once it boils, 
lower the heat to medium-low and cook for about 10 minutes or more, until you 
reach the doneness you prefer (I like it really chewy). Add water by the 
tablespoons if needed. I typically cook it like this when I am going to eat it 
for something savory. For breakfast, I go with the 1:3 oats to water ratio.</p>

<h2>Light and Super Creamy No-Bake Cheesecake</h2> 
<p>Posted on 28 March 2010. Tags: Baking and Confections, cakes, Cheesecake, 
Cooking, Food, Home, Shopping, Springform pan</p> 
<p><em>Can you have a good cheesecake with just little sugar and no eggs? Can 
it be smooth and creamy, and melts in your mouth and before you could even 
think, you&rsquo;ve already reached for your next bite? Why, yes and yes! Say 
hello to our family&rsquo;s lifelong addiction: the no-bake cheesecake. This is 
also perfect for those who don&rsquo;t like the heaviness of regular 
cheesecake. Perhaps you could even say it&rsquo;s a tad better for indulgences, 
too. Maybe&hellip;I like to think that. -Joy<br>
</em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>This is a personal invitation to try another favorite of our family. 
Signed, sealed, posted, it's yours to enjoy.</p> 
<p>No-bake cheesecake and our family goes way, way back in the 80&prime;s. My 
mother would spend Friday or Saturday nights on the dining table after dinner 
with her bowls, wooden spoons, stand mixer and springform pan to make 
cheesecake. The truth is, for the longest time I thought cheesecake was only 
made using my mom&rsquo;s no-bake method. Hahaha.! Unfortunately, my mom 
doesn&rsquo;t have the recipe anymore. I think everyone in our family will 
agree &ndash;that was gut-wrenchingly sad.<br>
<em><strong> </strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Uh, what are we going to do now?!</strong></em></p> 
<p>Sometime between my teenage years and our move to Canada, there was a 
cheesecake void in our household, we all got busy and us kids moved cities away 
for high school and university.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2002 or 2003 that I discovered (and had the 
inclination to make) a no-bake cheesecake recipe online. It didn&rsquo;t quite 
taste like my mom&rsquo;s but the methodology was close. I tweaked the 
ingredients until we were all satisfied with the taste. Then, at some 
point&ndash;GASP!&ndash;I<strong>lost</strong> the recipe. Gone. Not in my 
computer. Not in my mom&rsquo;s. Our family friend,Tita Thess (go check her 
out, she makes gorgeous bead jewelry) even asked for the recipe many moons ago, 
but it turns out I never sent it to her. In between moving and traveling, and 
not being in the kitchen much, the recipe was gone.<strong><em>There was no 
trace of it.</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>&hellip;.</em></strong></p> 
<p>For the longest time, I&rsquo;ve put off creating a recipe from scratch to 
replicate my mom&rsquo;s no-bake cheesecake because a) it&rsquo;s so 
time-consuming to get the combination; and b) I almost had it and then I lost 
it! Exasperating to say the least. However, these are the things in life you 
just have to be grown up about and deal with&ndash;so I did. These were the 
only things I remembered it had and outlines my starting point:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>2 8-ounce packages of cream cheese</li> 
<li>some amount of sour cream</li> 
<li>some amount of Knox unflavoured gelatin</li> 
<li>graham crackers</li> 
<li>sugar</li> 
<li>butter</li> 
<li>lemon zest (<em>god&hellip;that lemon zest that I would forever associate 
with cheesecake!)</em></li> </ul> 
<p>It&rsquo;s rather vague to say the least. I&rsquo;m looking at my notes on 
my calendar (yes, I know) and it was still back in the beginning of February. 
And let&rsquo;s just say that my weight is pretty much indicative of the amount 
of cheesecake I&rsquo;ve consumed to reach until March to get the recipe right. 
I just can be so dedicated to finding a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to my problem 
that I will not stop until everything is resolved &mdash; in this case, until 
the taste, texture and consistency is correct.<em><strong> </strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>How hard could it be to come up with our &ldquo;holy 
grail&rdquo; recipe?</strong></em></p> 
<p>I got the recipe for the crust right the 1st try, but the cake was lumpy 
because of the difference in temperature between the dissolved gelatin and the 
cream cheese mixture. It tasted good (not the best&ndash;too sweet), but one 
never should have to associate cheesecake with the word lumpy (=<em>lame</em>).
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It doesn't look like much right out of the pan, but for our family this 
elicits groans with, &quot;Put the topping already!&quot;</p> 
<p>On the second try, the cheesecake tasted better (still not perfect), but 
the texture was smoother. However, the cheesecake held up so well it almost 
looked fake, like when you buy cheesecake at a cheap establishment and 
it&rsquo;s almost like buying white Jell-O. Not good.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>You can make it party-ready by using the smooth edge of a table knife to 
scrape and smooth the cheesecake. Works like a charm.</p> 
<p>And then the third: melts-in-your-mouth no-bake cheesecake. And I made it 
again and again. And it&rsquo;s done.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It IS as good as it looks.</p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Get the recipe for the No-Bake 
Cheesecake now! (PDF download included)

<h2>Nutty Nutella Mochi: The Asian Ferrero Rocher</h2> 
<p>Posted on 05 February 2010. </p> 
<p><strong><em>Nutella on crack &mdash; as in, Nutella made with more 
hazelnuts! Creamy, crunchy, and chewy Nutty Nutella Mochi (mochi = sticky rice 
cake) is like an Asian version of one of my guilty-pleasure chocolate, Ferrero 
Rocher. It&rsquo;s very easy to make and lots of fun!</em></strong></p> 
<p>I used to be hooked on Ferrero Rocher as a child. I would have these gold 
foil-wrapped chocolates in my school bag and the pocket of my school uniform. 
When I discovered Nutella, it was like manna for my insatiable chocolate-loving 
young palate and definitely a much cheaper option than Ferrero Rocher. I would 
eat it mindlessly by the big spoonfuls (prior to Nutella, I consumed jar after 
jar of extra creamy peanut butter!). At some point I did learn to restrain 
myself&hellip;sometimes. Nutella lovers &mdash; you know what I mean, right? 
It&rsquo;s just physically straining to not give in to the craving! Ha ha.</p> 
<p>It is with glee that I will participate in World Nutella Day (hosted by 
these lovelies:Ms Adventures in Italy, Bleeding Espresso, and World Nutella Day
) with this Japanese-inspired&nbsp; treat:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to make <em>stuffed </em>mochi (addendum: I grew 
up with mochi or sticky rice cake, but we just call them by different names in 
the Philippines), so I thought I&rsquo;d combine that with Nutella. And guess 
what? They are perfect together!</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to make. Crushed hazelnuts and nutella are combined, 
lumped into balls and placed in the freezer to keep its shape when molding the 
rice cake around it. The rice cake is a combination of glutinous (sweet) rice 
flour, water and a little sugar. A little food coloring if you want to make it 
interesting. You can add flavors as you wish. The resulting paste is zapped in 
the microwave for a couple of minutes and then the wrapping begins!</p> 
<p>The stickiness is the tricky part and it&rsquo;s easy to solve by keeping 
your hands and work surface generously floured. Put in the freezer again to 
set. And voila! You got yourself some Asian Ferrero Rocher to snack on. No 
spoon needed.</p> 
<p>I loved this experiment so much that I&rsquo;m going to make more over the 
weekend. This will be a fun Valentine&rsquo;s treat for friends, family and 
lovahs.</p> 
<p><strong>Happy World Nutella Day and Happy Friday!</strong></p>
