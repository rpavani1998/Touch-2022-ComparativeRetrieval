<p><i>By Kate Hindin</i></p> 
<p>I am a huge fan of food. I love to eat it, make it, shop for it and watch 
shows about it, so when my supervisor told me that I was going to be judging a 
bake-sale contest benefiting the Food Bank, I could not have been happier!</p> 
<p>Marina Maher Communications decided to have a buildingwide bake sale, with 
proceeds benefiting the Food Bank. When I spoke with Cathy (MMC&rsquo;s 
enthusiastic bake-sale organizer) she figured that a bake sale was a perfect 
way to get people involved in hunger relief, have some healthy inter-office 
competition and sweeten up an otherwise rainy Thursday!</p> 
<p>I reported for my tasting duties, and Cathy escorted me into an empty 
conference room with a small table lined with plates of bars and brownies. I 
was instructed to taste and then judge each confection and secretly place the 
ballot in an envelope that was quickly whisked away to accounting for the final 
tally. I then got to bestow the winner of each category (Brownies/Bars, 
Cakes/Cupcakes/Breads/Muffins, Cookies, No Bake and Pies/Tarts) with their 
prizes along with a Food Bank T-shirt and pin. The winners were gracious and 
proud, as they should have been &ndash; the bake sale raised $454, enough to 
help provide more than 2,250 meals to hungry New Yorkers!</p> 
<p><i>If you would like to learn more about fundraising for the Food Bank For 
New York City, pleasecontact me. We are always looking for new and creative 
ways to get people involved (and if it includes food, even better!).</i></p>
