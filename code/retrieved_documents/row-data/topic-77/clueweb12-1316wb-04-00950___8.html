<p></p> 
<p>If you are what you eat, then I should weigh in at under $1 a pound. </p> 
<br> 
<p>That's because, as a general rule of thumb, I try to only buy foodstuff 
that costs under a buck per pound.<i>Under $1 a pound, year-round</i> &#151; 
that'smy grocery shopping mantra.</p> <br>

<p>It's not just because I'm a world-class penny-pincher and smart shopper; 
believe it or not, it's also about eating healthier. When you look at the USDA 
&quot;food pyramid,&quot; many of the things we should be eating the most of 
&#151; grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables &#151; happen to cost<i>the 
least.</i> It's often the stuff that's bad for us (at least in large 
quantities) &#151; red meat, fatty dairy products, and processed foods high in 
trans saturated fats &#151; that cost the most, on a per-pound basis</p> <br>

<p>To prove my point, I've put together this list of 50 healthy foods that 
I've purchased at least once in the last six months for under $1 a pound. 
First, a few disclaimers about my list-o-50:</p> <br>

<p><b>NO,</b> I don't live on another planet or in a part of the country where 
the cost of living is deflated. In fact, I live and shop in the Washington, DC, 
metro area, which has one of the highest costs of living (and groceries) in the 
country.</p> <br>

<p><b>NO,</b> I'm not saying that all of these items are available in every 
store, at all times. But if you shop carefully, you can always find at least 
some variety of these foods around which to plan your meals. Many of the items 
on the list (e.g., most root vegetables, bananas, beans, etc.) can usually be 
purchased for under $1 pound even when not on sale or in season. Other items on 
the list were &quot;store specials,&quot; and typically would cost more than $1 
a pound, and/or they were in season so cost less.</p> <br>

<p><b>NO,</b> none of the items on my under-$1-a-pound list are organically 
grown. The pros/cons of that debate aside, for most people with a limited 
budget, the choice isn't whether or not to buy expensive organic, it's whether 
or not to eat highly processed crap like fast food or eat inexpensive healthy 
foods like those on my list.</p> <br>

<p>See the dirty dozen foods with the most pesticides to maximize organic 
purchases.</p> <br>

<p><b>NO,</b> I'm not saying that by eating only these foods you'll have a 
complete, healthy diet. But they certainly can be the backbone around which to 
plan healthy, inexpensive menus for your family.</p> <br>

<p><b>NO,</b> I don't burn up a lot of time and gas by running around to a lot 
of different grocery stores, and I rarely use coupons. I shop only once every 
week or two, and I usually shop at only one or two stores. I plan my meals 
around the-best-of-the-best weekly store specials (a.k.a. the &quot;loss 
leaders&quot;), the sale items that are usually on the front page of the weekly 
circular most stores publish. If you're not a creative cook like me, try the
Advanced Recipe Search page, where you can enter the ingredients you have to 
work with and get all kinds of recipes.</p> <br>

<p>So rev up your shopping cart, but be careful: <i>There's a Green Cheapskate 
loose on aisle five!</i></p> <br>

<p><b> * Apples</b> &#151; One a day keeps the cheapskate away.<br>
<b> * 
Asparagus</b> &#151; HUGE store special at 99 cents a pound during Easter week. 
I bought 10 pounds, blanched it, and then froze it.<br>
<b> * Bananas</b> 
&#151; Potassium for pennies.<br>
<b> * Barley</b> &#151; A tasty alternative 
to rice and potatoes.<br>
<b> * Beans</b> &#151; Canned or dried: kidney, 
pinto, navy, black, red, and many more.<br>
<b> * Bok choy</b> &#151; Steam and 
serve with a little soy sauce.<br>
<b> * Broccoli</b> &#151; Yes, a store 
special. Usually closer to $2 per pound.<br>
<b> * Bulgur wheat</b> &#151; Try 
it inpilaf or a tabbouleh salad. <br>
<b> * Cabbage</b> &#151; Green and red. I 
like mine fried.<br>
<b> * Cantaloupe</b> &#151; No, sorry, I can't; I'm 
already married.<br>
<b> * Carrots</b> &#151; Raw or steamed; rich in 
carotenes, a healthy antioxidant.<br>
<b> * Celery</b> &#151; Stir-fry it for a 
change.<br>
<b> * Chicken</b> &#151; Whole or various parts, on sale. <br>
<b> *
Chickpeas</b> &#151; Also called garbanzo beans. Mash 'em up as a healthy 
sandwich spread.<br>
<b> * Cornmeal</b> &#151; &quot;Polenta&quot; is all the 
rage these days, but I loved it 40 years ago when Mom called it &quot;cornmeal 
mush.&quot;<br>
<b> * Cucumbers</b> &#151; Try peeling, seeding, and steaming 
with a little butter and salt.<br>
<b> * Daikon radish</b> &#151; My new 
favorite raw veggie.<br>
<b> * Eggs</b> &#151; Don't overdo them, but eggs 
provide high-quality protein and still cost about $1 per pound. (Plus, there 
are manyeggscellent things you can do with the shells.)<br>
<b> * Green beans
</b> &#151; Frozen, but fresh are sometimes on sale for under $1 a pound in 
season.<br>
<b> * Greens</b> &#151; Kale, mustard, turnip, and collard greens 
are rich in vitamins and a good source of fiber.<br>
<b> * Grapes</b> &#151; 
Store special @ .99 a pound.<br>
<b> * Grapefruit</b> &#151; Bake with a little 
brown sugar on top for a healthy dessert.<br>
<b> * Lentils</b> &#151; Perhaps 
the perfect food: healthy, cheap, and versatile (thinksoups, salads, sandwich 
spreads &#151; and those are only some of the &quot;s&quot; possibilities). <br>
<b> * Liver</b> &#151; Chicken livers usually cost under $1 a pound, and 
sometimes beef and pork liver can be found in the DMZ (&quot;Dollar Maximum 
Zone&quot;).<br>
<b> * Mangoes</b> &#151; High in fiber and vitamins A, B6, and 
C.<br>
<b> * Milk</b> &#151; Yep, on a per-pound basis, milk still costs well 
under $1 a pound.<br>
<b> * Napa cabbage</b> &#151; Delicious steamed or raw in 
a salad.<br>
<b> * Oatmeal</b> &#151; The good old-fashioned 
&quot;slow-cooking&quot; kind...that takes all of five minutes.<br>
<b> * Onions
</b> &#151; Try baking them whole in a cream sauce. <br>
<b> * Oranges</b> 
&#151; Frequent sale price when in season.<br>
<b> * Pasta</b> &#151; Store 
special @ .89 a pound &#151; I nearly bought them out!<br>
<b> * Peanut butter
</b> &#151; Special sale price, but stock up because it usually has a long 
shelf life.<br>
<b> * Pork</b> &#151; Inexpensive cuts of pork frequently go on 
sale for 99 cents per pound or less; sometimes evenham during the holidays. <br>
<b> * Potatoes</b> &#151; White and red &#151; baked, mashed, boiled, broiled, 
steamed.<br>
<b> * Pumpkin</b> &#151; Yes, you can eat the same ones you buy as 
holiday decorations, and they usually cost under 50 cents a pound. <br>
<b> * 
Rice</b> &#151; White for under $1 a pound; brown, a little more expensive but 
better for you.<br>
<b> * Rutabagas</b> &#151; Hated them as a kid; can't get 
enough of them now.<br>
<b> * Sour cream</b> &#151; 99 cents on sale, but long 
shelf life, so stock up. My cucumber awaits.<br>
<b> * Spinach</b> &#151; 
Frozen (but Popeye doesn't care).<br>
<b> * Split peas</b> &#151; Add a hambone 
and make the ultimate comfort soup. Try it in theslow cooker!<br>
<b> * Squash
</b> &#151; Try baking acorn squash with a little brown sugar. <br>
<b> * Sweet 
corn</b> &#151; Canned, or fresh on the cob, in season. (Try this recipe for 
summer corn fritters.)<br>
<b> * Tomatoes</b> (canned) &#151; Canned are often 
better than fresh to use in cooking, and occasionally you can find fresh on 
sale for under a buck, in season.<br>
<b> * Turkey</b> &#151; A popular 
bargain-priced loss leader around the holidays. Buy an extra bird and freeze it 
for later.<br>
<b> * Turnips</b> &#151; Make me think of my grandparents, who 
always grew them.<br>
<b> * Watermelon</b> &#151; Whole, in-season melons can 
sometime cost less than 20 cents a pound if they're on sale and you find a big 
one.<br>
<b> * Wine</b> &#151; Well, at least the stuff I drink: 5-liter box 
(approximately 11 pounds) for about 10 bucks, on sale. (BTW, the beer I drink 
is even less expensive per pound.)<br>
<b> * Yams/sweet potatoes</b> &#151; One 
of the healthiest foods you can eat, and usually available year around for 
under $1 a pound.<br>
<b> * Yogurt</b> &#151; 8-ounce containers on sale two 
for $1.<br>
<b> * Zucchini</b> &#151; Okay, they're a type of squash (above). 
But I love them so much they deserve their own place on the list.</p> <br>

<p>Now look at all the money you've saved! </p> <br>
