<h2>Twelve Creative Ways to Use Coconut Oil</h2> 
<p>While millions of Americans are discovering the many benefits of using<br>
 
organic coconut oil, their are dozens of other great uses for coconut<br>
 oil.
</p> 
<p>Below is a nice overview on 12 ways to use virgin coconut oil. Let us<br>
 
know us if you try these and how you think it worked for you.</p> 
<p>From Natural News newsletter:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>(NaturalNews) In the past several years, coconut oil has become a sort of 
rising star in the world of health food. More and more homes have a jar of 
organic extra virgin coconut oil on their pantry shelf. But coconut oil is more 
than a healthy cooking alternative. There are endless ways to use coconut oil 
that extend far beyond the occasional cookie or stir-fry. Here are twelve 
creative uses for a classic health food:</p> 
<p><strong>Colds and Sore Throats</strong> &ndash; Coconut oil has 
antimicrobial properties that can help you recover from a cold. Mix it with 
warm tea and honey for a very soothing throat remedy.</p> 
<p><strong>Cuts and Scrapes</strong> &ndash; Coconut oil can be used as a 
topical cream for common cuts and scrapes, protecting against infection while 
conditioning the skin to heal faster. It may also prevent scarring.</p> 
<p><strong>Dandruff</strong> &ndash; Several times per week, coat your 
fingertips with&nbsp;coconut oil and massage it into your scalp for an 
easy&nbsp;dandruff cure. This is an effective yet gentle method, suitable for 
young children or babies with cradle cap, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Deodorant</strong> &ndash; You can use coconut oil by itself as 
a&nbsp;deodorant that leaves underarms feeling silky soft, or you can add&nbsp;
baking soda and cornstarch for advanced odor protection.</p> 
<p><strong>Detoxification</strong> &ndash; There are many methods for 
detoxifying the body, but coconut oil is unique because it can provide energy 
while cleansing the body. One popular method is to take 1-2 tablespoon of 
coconut oil seven times per day for one to seven days to cleanse the body from 
toxins, impurities and candida.</p> 
<p><strong>Fungal Infections</strong> &ndash; Coconut oil contains strong 
antifungal agents, and can be used to treat&nbsp;fungal infections like 
athlete&rsquo;s foot, ringworm, thrush and vaginal yeast infections. You can 
use it internally and topically for these conditions.</p> 
<p><strong>Hair Conditioner</strong> &ndash; Apply a thin layer of coconut oil 
to your scalp and hair. Allow it to soak for several minutes and then wash as 
usual. There is no need to use other conditioners with this method, even after 
washing with shampoo.</p> 
<p><strong>Lip Balm</strong> &ndash; Lip moisturizers are filled with&nbsp;
chemicals, and natural products are often pricey. If you need a&nbsp;moisturizer
 for your lips, try coconut oil in a commercial&nbsp;lip balm container.</p> 
<p><strong>Make-up Remover</strong> &ndash; Coconut oil is a very effective 
make-up remover, so you can toss out all the chemical-laden products from the 
drug store. It&rsquo;s also a natural moisturizer, so it won&rsquo;t cause 
dryness or irritation.</p> 
<p><strong>Skin Conditions</strong> &ndash; Since coconut oil is moisturizing, 
antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, it&rsquo;s a great natural 
remedy for all kinds of skin problems ranging from eczema to acne to diaper 
rash.</p> 
<p><strong>Sun screen</strong> &ndash; Coconut oil provides effective and 
natural sun protection without exposing your body to the toxic chemicals and 
metals in conventional sun block. Coconut oil protects against free radicals, 
which provides added protection against skin cancer.</p> 
<p><strong>Toothpaste</strong> &ndash; Mix an equal amount of coconut oil and 
baking&nbsp;soda for an all-natural, fluoride-free&nbsp;toothpaste. Add 
spearmint or peppermint oil with stevia for a fresh, sweet flavor.</p> 
<p>As you can see, there is more to coconut oil that what meets the eye 
&ndash; or the frying pan!</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Eat Fat &ndash; Lose Weight!! The Incredible Oils That Actually Aid Weight 
Loss!</h2> 
<p>We found this excellent article over at seek-inn.com the other day. 
&nbsp;This information in no way new news; the article was originally written 
in 2006, but now, in 2009 many people still do not understand the important 
role healthy fats play in a balanced diet.</p> 
<p>Enjoy!</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Copyright 2006 Sylvia Riley</p> 
<p>The notion of &lsquo;healthy fats&rsquo; is becoming increasingly 
acknowledged. The idea that some fats may actually help you loose weight 
however, is a little further-fetched, and yet It appears this seeming paradox 
is indeed the case. As will be explored, both coconut oil and omega-3 oil can 
speed up metabolism and accelerate the burning of fats in the body.</p> 
<p>Distinguishing between fats is imperative for optimum health and weight. 
Saturated animal fats are notoriously linked to obesity, heart disease and 
cancer. Hydrogenated fats as found in chocolates, baked products and margarines 
are even worse and contain trans fats, the most harmful fats of all. Refined 
cooking oils are also detrimental, with harsh processing methods altering oil 
molecules and creating toxins and free radicals.</p> 
<p>Natural cold-pressed oils such as nut, seed, olive and fish oils, contain 
healthy essential fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, nutrients and 
phytochemicals that serve the body.</p> 
<p>Coconut oil is also supremely healthy; a saturated fat structurally 
different from animal saturated fats containing medium-chain as opposed to 
long-chain fatty acids. These molecules are small enough to be absorbed 
directly into the liver and used as an immediate source of energy by the body. 
They place no strain on the digestive system and their availability for 
metabolism means they are not likely to be stored as fat (unlike high-calorie 
cholesterol-heavy long-chain animal fats).</p> 
<p>Coconut oil has a plethora of noted health benefits. It houses lauric acid, 
an antimicrobial fatty acid that fights bacteria, viruses and fungi. Some more 
surprising benefits include an ability to lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of 
heart disease and actually stimulate weight loss. It has also been found to 
benefit conditions such as diabetes, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, 
digestive disorders and thyroid imbalances.</p> 
<p>Dr. Weston A Price, the Darwin of nutrition writes: &lsquo;Replacing the 
fats you now eat with coconut oil may be the wisest decision you can make to 
lose excess body fat&hellip;Yes, there is a dietary fat that can actually help 
you take off unwanted pounds. Coconut oil can quite literally be called a 
low-fat fat.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>In the 1940&rsquo;s farmers discovered that attempts to fatten up their 
animals with coconut oil produced the opposite effect; they became leaner and 
more active. Ironically, with the demand for leaner meat today, they are now 
using coconut oil for this exact purpose.</p> 
<p>Raymond Peat MD, author of Coconut Oil and Its Virtues concludes, 
&lsquo;The anti-obesity effect of coconut oil is clear in all of the animal 
studies, and in my friends who eat it regularly.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Omega-3 oil is another virtuous fat that can actually speed up the burning 
of fats in the body and hence aid weight loss. Omega-3 oil serves numerous 
bodily processes and is particularly beneficial to the immune system and heart 
as well as arthritis, skin conditions, pre-menstrual tension, mental function, 
improving memory and reducing depressive symptoms.</p> 
<p>One of the main reasons omega 3 oil increases fat metabolism is because of 
its effects on insulin, significantly reducing it&rsquo;s levels in the body. 
Insulin inhibits the enzyme lipase which breaks down fat for use as energy and 
activates an enzyme that converts carbohydrate into fat. Insulin promotes the 
use of fat for storage and reduces the use of fat for fuel, hence lower insulin 
levels mean a greater conversion of fat for energy rather than storage.</p> 
<p>Omega-3 oil is found in cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon, herring 
and mackerel as well as plant sources such as flax seeds (the richest plant 
source), walnuts, pumpkin seeds, mustard seeds, green-leafed vegetables and 
spirulina.</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Make-up Artist Kandee Johnson Recommends Nutiva Hempshakes for Fitness and 
Weight Loss</h2> 
<h2>The Healthy Crossroads of Fashion and Nutrition</h2> 
<p><em>By Mark Bielski</em><br>
 Nutiva Internet Sales and Customer Service 
Manager</p> 
<p>When do we look our best? When we are feeling our best. How do we feel our 
best? Probably not on Big Macs and Big Gulp sodas. Certainly, genes play their 
part in overall health as well as our environment but making the most of what 
we are given can be influenced greatly by what we choose to eat and the 
activities we engage in. David Wolfe&rsquo;s book Eating for Beauty is a good 
example of how the foods we eat can affect the way we feel and the way we look.
</p> 
<p>Kandee Johnson, a young, well known YouTube make up artist, with a flair 
for creating amazing looks, looks amazing herself, and she attributes this in 
part to her diet and workout routine. She recently made a YouTube video to 
address her viewers&rsquo; frequently asked questions about her lifestyle and 
how it affects her well being. In it she recommends Nutiva&rsquo;sHempshakes in 
the mornings as an integral part of her weight loss and fitness program.</p> 
<p>Many of you are already familiar with The Nutiva Diet Makeover plan which 
is a program we developed for weight loss and well being. In it we recommend 
switching out unhealthy fats in your diet for coconut oil and hemp oil and 
using our other hempseed products; the shelled hempseeds, hemp protein powder, 
and Hempshakes. It is also important on this plan to eat lots of fresh fruits 
and vegetables, organic whenever possible, and to eliminate the junk fats and 
foods from your diet.</p> 
<p>In a tribute to Kandee and her fans, Nutiva has decided to extend our 
Hempshake sale on our website at www.nutiva.com until June 1st.</p> 
<p>Thanks, Kandee, for being a loyal Nutiva fan and for sharing your 
enthusiasm and zest for life with your followers.</p>

<h2>Nutiva Diet Makeover- Improve your Diet the Organic Way Now on YouTube</h2>
<p>Learn how two women are losing body weight and improving their health. 
Discover one key weight loss secret of switching out &ldquo;bad fats&rdquo; of 
junk veggie corn,soy &amp; canola oils for &ldquo;good fats&rdquo; of Hemp, 
Olive, and Coconut oils. While it&rsquo;s hard to believe the average American 
diet consists of 20% soy oil in total calories. This negatively impacts our 
heart, hormone,skin, and brain functions and leads to greater inflammation. The 
Youtube clip is a reality TV showing the industrial foods they were eating and 
then the new healthier foods they have switched to. This is a great example of 
the fact that people can lose weight by eating lot&rsquo;s of healthy fats by

<p>Looking for a Way to Eat Right Without Giving Up Flavor?</p> 
<p>Many people are becoming more aware of the importance of eating well and 
leading a healthy lifestyle, but aren't sure exactly how to incorporate this 
into their own routine. Contrary to popular belief, eating well doesn't have to 
mean a drastic overhaul of how you cook.</p> 
<p>It also doesn't mean that you have to compromise on taste or texture. </p> 
<p>With just a few simple additions to your cooking methods and daily diet, 
you can start eating more healthily while enjoying every last bite. Nutiva is 
proud to offer an extensive range of healthy, delicious hemp foods and virgin
coconut oil products that make it easier than ever to start eating right.</p> 
<p>Try Unrefined Coconut Oil for Better Taste and Better Health</p> 
<p>For example, Nutiva's extra-virgin coconut oil is not only good for you, 
but it's an excellent addition to any kitchen. Our virgin coconut oil is 
unrefined, unbleached and unfermented, giving it a light taste, pleasant aroma 
and pure white color. Ourcoconut oil is also unhydrogenated, eliminating the 
unhealthy fats found in hydrogenated oils. For centuries, people have cherished
coconut oil for its beautiful flavor, and it has widely been used in cooking 
throughout the world.</p> 
<p>Looking for Coconut Butter or Coconut Cream?</p> 
<p>Coconut Manna&trade; is creamy whole coconut that will delight people 
looking forcoconut butter, coconut cream, coconut oil butter and coconut body 
butter.Coconut Manna&trade; is a delicious whole food, made of pure, dried 
coconut flesh which will &ldquo;melt in your mouth.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Why Choose Nutiva's Unrefined Coconut Oil?</p> 
<p>What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies 
in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being 
chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which 
can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves 
as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best 
results for any use.</p> 
<p>Why Virgin Coconut Oil is Good for You</p> 
<p>Unrefined coconut oil doesn't just taste better, it's better for you. With 
around 50% lauric acid content (an acid also found in mother's milk), it helps 
support a healthy metabolism and is being researched for its ability to protect 
against fungus, bacteria and viruses. The benefits of coconut oil's lauric acid 
are so strong, it is often added to baby formula to help infants develop strong 
and healthy systems.</p> 
<p>Consider also the fact that Pacific Islanders long used coconut as a staple 
of their diets. Those who still subscribe to a coconut-rich diet display low 
incidences of heart disease or obesity. Those who switch to more 
&quot;Western&quot; ingredients, such as Omega-6 laden vegetable oils, often 
show a remarkable increase in these illnesses and other health problems.</p> 
<p>Experience the Versatility of Virgin Coconut Oil</p> 
<p>Of course, coconut oil can be used in other ways as well. Coconut oil is 
often used in skin creams and lotions for its ability to moisturize and nourish 
the skin. Whether you want a healthy replacement for vegetable and animal fat 
for your cooking, or are simply looking for better options in your daily skin 
care regime, choose Nutiva's unrefined virgincoconut oil.</p> 
<p>With its healthy properties, excellent taste and beautiful aroma, unrefined 
coconut oil from Nutiva is the perfect solution.</p> <br>
