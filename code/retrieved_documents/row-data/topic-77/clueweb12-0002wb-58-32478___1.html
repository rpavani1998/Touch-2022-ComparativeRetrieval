How to Make Your Own German Foods and Ingredients <br>
 What are your reasons 
for cooking or baking from scratch? Is it because it is better food, better for 
you or is there a deeper meaning for you? Do you cook and bake from scratch for 
you or for others? What do you buy rather than cook or bake from scratch?Share 
Your Reasons <br>

<h2>Family time/better taste/healthier</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I loved it when my daughter and I would bake together and I have fond 
memories of baking cookies with my grandmother. You can't get those from store 
bought cookies. And no matter what any cookie or baked good claims, they are 
never as good as home made. Those my uncle made as his bakery came the closest. 
I also loved that I could use whole wheat flour and other healthy ingredients 
which usually improved the taste besides making them more nutritious. The kids 
never complained about the difference.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;JeannetteAnne </dt> </dl> 
<h2>It tastes better!</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I detest the flavor of preservatives in my food and even when others 
can't detect them, I can taste them. I'm just lucky that way. I prefer to do my 
own from-scratch baking or to go without. I abhor cellophane-packaged cookies. 
I love my sweets, but I would rather go without than subject myself to those!!
</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Barb.Rolek </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Better Taste, More Satisfaction</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> Baking is satisfying to me, so that's a big part of it. It is a way to 
share myself in a tasty way with others. I also find the taste of my baking is 
better than store-bought. Additionally, I make traditional recipes that you 
can't find in stores. That makes it even more special.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;BethPete </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Far Superior</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> Scratch is far superior that processed. You know what ingredients you are 
using and they're most likely healthier. It provides a true sense of 
accomplishment and creativity that store bought doesn't. If you want to tweek a 
recipe you can, to enhance or improve it. I grew up with scratch and taught my 
children to bake from scratch. The flavor has no competition.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest BarbaraDUAA </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Baking</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I enjoy baking. It's relaxing and the results are so much better than 
store-bought. The fact that the food is healthier is an added bonus!</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;amyhertzler </dt> </dl> 
<h2>It is better for my family</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> When I bake from scratch I know exactly what is in the food. Butter 
instead of lard. Organic eggs instead of eggs with antibiotics</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Gertraud </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Food Pepared With Sacred Vibration</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I like to know what is going into my food, pure and simple ingredients 
without food additives or animal products, and like to do prayer and meditation 
remembering the divine while engaged in food preparation so that what we eat 
has the blessing of meditative reflective sacred vibration and is made with 
love.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;S_Khalsa </dt> </dl> 
<h2>A Matter of Pride</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I know that made-from-scratch food is better for you. You can tweak the 
recipes to meet your own dietary needs. The taste is also better. But the real 
reason I cook from scratch is that it's a matter of pride. If I am going to 
have pie, it's going to be homemade pie. If I'm going to serve food to company, 
it's going to be something I've created.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Susan </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Better tasting; Better health</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I prefer to cook many dishes from scratch because the food is usually 
better tasting and better for my family in general. I also find a sort of 
therapy in cooking - I like to make up my own &quot;concoctions&quot; and 
casseroles. I much prefer to bake than buy cookies and cakes. Homemade is 
always so much better!</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Connie G. Barwick </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Creative outlet</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I like to cook and bake from scratch because it gives me a creative 
outlet. You can make a cake from a mix, but it isn't really creative - mixing 
one up from scratch, and experimenting with the ingredients, is much more 
interesting. Soups, breads, cookies, stir-fry - they all taste better if you 
make them from scratch. I always think that I should make things like yogurt 
and butter from scratch, too, like my mom used to do, but I never actually do 
that.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Kallie </dt> </dl> 
<h2>I do</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> 1) The food I make from scratch, using raw ingredients, is far better 
than anything I can buy in terms of taste. Even my personal Cream of Mushroom 
soup tastes far better than Campbell's, hands down, in a green bean casserole. 
2) By using raw ingredients I avoid all the preservatives and artificial 
emulsifiers and refined flavor enhancers in food products - which seems 
healthier to me. 3) There is a deep sense of satisfaction in beginning with raw 
ingredients and producing a meal that is superior to in taste and nutrition to 
something you buy. 4) Although a bean casserole is easier to make with 
Campbell's soup, there are thousands upon thousands of quick and easy recipes 
that can me made from scratch in less than 30 minutes.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Kevin </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Saves money</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> Not having full employment has given me the time to cook from scratch and 
the empty wallet which makes going out unaffordable for a whole family.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest redfred </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Too much HFCS</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> When I saw that my favorite bread had high fructose corn syrup in it, I 
decided it was time to learn how to bake bread. Homemade bread is more 
nutritious for you anyway. Not to mention the smell while it's baking.</dd>
