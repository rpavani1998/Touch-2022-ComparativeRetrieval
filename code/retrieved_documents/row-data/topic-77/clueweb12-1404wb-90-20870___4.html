<h2> The Great Bake Sale Debate </h2> April 2nd, 2010 Posted by No Comments 
<br> 
<p>As reported in a previous post, the New York City Department of Education 
(DOE) recently passed a regulation banning home baked goods from being sold in 
schools for fund raising purposes with the exception of one PTA run bake sale 
per month. Instead, parents and students are allowed to choose from 27 approved 
snack items which they can buythrough Costco or the DOE &ndash; the same items 
which are regularly sold in school vending machines. These items include 
Doritos, Pop Tarts and Linden&rsquo;s cookies.</p> 
<p>The regulation has caused quite a stir among New York parents. On March 18th
, there was a &ldquo;Bake-In&rdquo; rally held at City Hall byNYC Green Schools 
calling for an appeal of the regulation. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and 
Council Member Gail Brewer were in attendance along with parents and children 
fighting for the bake sale cause. This regulation has also sparked a bit of 
debate here at our office with varying opinions on whether the regulation is 
achieving its goal in reducing calories or merely encouraging students to 
indulge in junk food.</p> 
<p>So, in the spirit of The New York Times &ldquo;Room for Debate&rdquo; 
column, we present you with several varying opinions on New York City&rsquo;s 
bake-sale ban.</p> 
<p><strong>Home-Baked, Healthy Kids</strong></p> 
<p>By Sophy Bishop</p> 
<p>New York&rsquo;s children, along with the rest of the nation&rsquo;s, are 
overweight &ndash; it&rsquo;s awell known fact. I&rsquo;m no scientist, but 
I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that is it is junk food &ndash; mass 
produced, over-consumed, nutrient-poor crap &ndash; that has caused this 
epidemic. The issue is compounded by lack of exercise and minimal time spent at 
the table and with family, but at the heart of this problem, it is what 
children consume that is to blame.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many children and their parents are never taught the 
elements of a proper diet. When the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; that is the DOE 
says Doritos are ok but home baked goods are not, it only enforces the scheme 
that junk food is what they should be eating. Seeing those labels day after 
day, they become commonplace, training minds and taste buds alike to prefer 
HFCS and artificial flavors. These preferences get carried beyond the school 
and out into a lifetime. They form a favor for fast meals, greasy meat 
byproducts and fried food and a distaste for fresh, green vegetables.</p> 
<p>Home-baked goods trump junk food any day, whether they contain more or less 
calories than a pack of Pop Tarts. They surpass junk food because of what they 
represent &ndash; care, time, seasonality and home-cooking. There is no shiny 
advertising, no unpronounceable chemical and no major corporation influencing 
life-long decisions. Home-baked goods foster community, culture, a love for 
cooking and eventually, a healthier America.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Time For Real Food</strong></p> 
<p>By Dawn Brighid</p> 
<p>With a fundamentally broken school food system (and food systems in 
general), I can see why banning the school bake sale feels like a little 
control over a bad situation. Childhood obesity is at an all time high, with no 
end in sight. Limiting a child&rsquo;s food intake will solve the problem, 
right? Not so convinced and a bit confused by the bake sale ban, I asked some 
questions at the &ldquo;bake in&rdquo; rally at city hall.</p> 
<p>The most problematic information I came away with was that often the 
&ldquo;homemade&rdquo; goods for sale weren&rsquo;t actually homemade. The 
cakes and cookies are often bought cheaply from stores like Costco and Target. 
They are then marked up and sold back to the kids. Why? One parent told me the 
funds were often used to support after school activities &ndash; just the kind 
that help prevent obesity. But with no funds, no after school exercise. What a 
&ldquo;Catch 22.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We need more funds for schools. We need real food in the schools. We need 
education about food for kids and parents. Do I think that a bake sale ban will 
resolve the obesity problem? No. It seems like a quick fix to me. I think 
putting our time, energy and money into national programs like &ldquo;Time for 
Lunch&rdquo; is a better way to get to the core issues we need to fight the 
childhood obesity issues for the long run.</p> 
<p><strong>Acceptable (Marginally)</strong></p> 
<p>By Chris Hunt</p> 
<p>As a longtime proponent of freedom, homemade cookies and public policies 
that don&rsquo;t unduly pad the coffers of the industro-snack sector, I found 
it tough to stomach the bake sale ban.&nbsp; But as an advocate of efficient 
implementation of policies that effectively protect public health, I 
begrudgingly support the rule.&nbsp; Mostly.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: 43% of NYC schoolchildren are overweight or obese 
&ndash; this is a public health crisis that needs to be addressed immediately. 
&nbsp;Obviously, there&rsquo;s no quick-fix solution to the childhood obesity 
epidemic; the problem is related to food access, consumption patterns, physical 
activity, environmental factors, etc.&nbsp; Nonetheless, an effective policy 
response must involve promoting healthful food choices and discouraging 
consumption of excess calories.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to argue that 
brownies and cupcakes and cookies and rice crispy treats are optimal food 
choices &ndash; or that such foods, when habitually consumed immoderately, 
constitute anything but excess calories.</p> 
<p>Ideally, we&rsquo;d teach kids to make better food choices, and 
they&rsquo;d do so despite the abundance and accessibility of junk food at bake 
sales and elsewhere.&nbsp; The government has attempted to implement this very 
strategy for decades &ndash; andfailed miserably.&nbsp; If we make the 
reasonable assumption that the DOE can&rsquo;t dramatically alter 
students&rsquo; food-purchasing preferences overnight, then a prudent policy 
approach would involve reducing the amount of unhealthful food available in 
schools &ndash; which would require the city to either limit the frequency of 
bake sales, or ensure that only healthful foods are sold.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, bake sales are an important source of revenue, so schools 
are unwilling to cut back drastically, or reduce profits by restricting sales 
to fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; (Strangely, the fact that schools lack 
sufficient funding to operate without supplemental bake-sale dollars has been 
largely ignored throughout the debate.)</p> 
<p>The city&rsquo;s solution: limit the frequency of no-treat-left-behind bake 
sales, and ban aggressively unhealthful foods from all the other bake 
sales.&nbsp; The obvious problem: homemade foods are prohibited from the latter 
events &ndash; even if they&rsquo;re more healthful than anything on the 
city&rsquo;s list of approved junkLite foods.&nbsp; And of course, it&rsquo;s 
lamentable that the policy tacitly endorses prepackaged, processed snacks and 
drums up extra business for the makers of Doritos, Poptarts, et al.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the current ban has merit from a public health perspective; 
sure, it&rsquo;d be great if kids ate carrots &ndash; but given the obesity 
crisis, it&rsquo;s better they eat somewhat-healthful snacks than exceptionally 
unhealthful snacks &ndash; homemade or otherwise.&nbsp; Ideally though, the 
city would either exclude everything but fruit and veggies from the 
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; bake sales, or else develop criteria for inclusion of 
healthful homemade foods.&nbsp; Or give schools adequate funding so that bake 
sales wouldn&rsquo;t be a financial imperative in the first place.</p> <br>
