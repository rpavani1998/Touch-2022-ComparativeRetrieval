<h2>6 Oscar-Worthy Party Foods</h2> Tuesday, February 21st, 2012 <br>

<p>Baked Mushroom-Topped Brie</p> 
<p>The Oscars are this weekend, and whether you&rsquo;re a movie buff or not, 
the awards show is always a good excuse for a party. It&rsquo;s also a good 
excuse to try new recipes that speak to the glamour of the evening&mdash;skip 
the nachos and wings (unless you love them) and try some decidedly fancier fare.
</p> 
<p>Here are six tasty treats that you can serve to keep your guests satisfied 
from the red carpet coverage all the way to the Best Picture announcement.</p> 
<p>Baked Mushroom-Topped Brie<br>
 Prepare and chill the mushroom topping to 
have on hand for the big night. Baking and serving on oven-proof platter keeps 
the cheese warm while eating. Serve with sliced baguette or your favourite 
crackers.</p> 
<p>Bacon, Caramelized Onion and Rosemary Pizza with Blue Cheese<br>
Sliced 
into squares or slivers, this is a great party appetizer. Onions and bacon can 
both be cooked in advance and refrigerated, allowing the pizza to be assembled 
in minutes.&nbsp;If you want to make it sound fancier, replace the word 
&ldquo;pizza&rdquo; with &ldquo;flatbread&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Sweet Potato Almond Chipotle Soup</p> 
<p>Sweet Potato and Almond Chipotle Soup<br>
This soup is a perfect balance of 
sweet from the sweet potato, earthy from the almonds and heat from the smoky 
chipotle&mdash;good for you too! Serve them in tiny servings to make them 
easier to eat around the TV.</p> 
<p>Almond-Crusted Chevre and Grape Truffles<br>
This is a deceptively simple 
make ahead hors d&rsquo;oeuvre or a great activity for an interactive party. 
It&rsquo;s a substantial nibble, think traditional cheese platter with fruits 
and almonds, all in one bite!</p> 
<p>Savoury Strawberry and Pecan Truffles<br>
One bite into this decadent 
morsel and you&rsquo;ll be asking for more. Velvety goat cheese blended with 
the sweetness of strawberries, crunch of pecans and then drizzled with a 
decadent, artisan honey.</p> 
<p>Little Spring Cakes<br>
Filled with fruit, these little individual cakes 
are the perfect addition to a party spread for those who like a little sweet at 
the end of an evening. Serve them when you bring out the tea and coffee.</p>

<h2>4 Healthier Super Bowl Snacks</h2> Monday, January 30th, 2012 
<p>Crispy Quinoa, Lime and Chipotle-Crusted Chicken Strips</p> 
<p>After the major holidays, Super Bowl Sunday might just be one of the 
greatest food events of the year. Even if you&rsquo;re not a football fan, the 
food alone is enough to get anyone excited about the game.</p> 
<p>But, like most of our major holidays, the food served isn&rsquo;t exactly 
health-check approved. Chicken wings, nachos with cheese sauce, pizza, 
beer&hellip; it&rsquo;s not exactly a healthfest. But you can lighten up some 
Super Bowl favourites with these delicious options. Not all of these are lower 
in fat, but they all deliver more health per serving, whether it be whole wheat 
ingredients,&nbsp;more protein, more healthy fats or less sodium than their 
store-bought cousins. Game on!</p> 
<p>Crispy Quinoa, Lime and Chipotle-Crusted Chicken Fingers<br>
Think outside 
the usual quinoa salad box and this fabulous ancient grain can offer endless 
recipe possibilities. Keep cooked quinoa available in the fridge for extra 
quick meal prep. Crunchy carrots sticks make a delightful accompaniment.</p> 
<p>Whole Wheat Nachos with Corn<br>
This spin on nachos still packs a cheesy 
punch, but whole wheat is a healthier base than traditional nacho chips.</p> 
<p>Avocado Mango Salsa</p> 
<p>Homemade Whole Wheat and Beer Pizza<br>
This pizza has been known to 
disappear off plates in seconds. Be creative with your toppings and use 
what&rsquo;s in your fridge.</p> 
<p>Avocado Mango Salsa<br>
The mango adds a sweet and lively twist to this 
spicy salsa. Delicious with chicken or fish, or on its own with soft corn 
tortillas.&nbsp;Plus, when you make it at home, you get to control how much 
sodium goes in.</p>

<h2>4 Resolution-Approved Sweets</h2> Thursday, January 12th, 2012 
<p>Strawberry Tiramisu</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve made your healthy resolutions for 2012, and now you just need 
a little help sticking to them? No problem.</p> 
<p>Here are four sweet treats you can make, serve and enjoy without any guilt 
attached.</p> 
<p>Strawberry Tiramisu<br>
 Creamy and velvety, this spinoff of the famous 
Italian tiramisu is less fattening, easier to make and sure to be a hit!</p> 
<p>Cinnamon Apple Chips<br>
Crisp, oven baked apple chips with a hint of 
cinnamon-y-sweetness offer a nutritious solution for snack time.</p> 
<p>Sweet &quot;Puppy Chow&quot;</p> 
<p>Chocolate Surprise Muffins<br>
Make these rich Chocolate Surprise Muffins 
packed with zucchini as a special treat. These muffins are as healthy as they 
are decadent.</p> 
<p>Sweet &ldquo;Puppy Chow&rdquo; Snack Mix<br>
This snack mix is a nutritious 
take on the sweet party mix often referred to as &ldquo;puppy chow.&rdquo; With 
less butter, less sugar and more fibre and antioxidants, this version 
doesn&rsquo;t have to be reserved just for parties.</p>

<h2>5 Tasty Movie-Night Snacks</h2> Friday, October 21st, 2011 
<p>Cheese and Seed Savoury Cookies</p> 
<p>A new study has proven what most of have known for years: cold weather can 
make you want to curl up indoors with a great movie (particularlyromantic 
comedies).</p> 
<p>So whip up a batch of something delicious (whether sweet or salty), grab a 
blanket and have a solid night in. Here are our top movie-night snack foods:</p>
<p>Cheese and Seed Savoury Cookies<br>
 These savory cookies, perfect for any 
time of day, are so delicious they won&rsquo;t last long!</p> 
<p>Taco Mexican Snack Mix<br>
This is a great little snack. Not sure what to 
do with the left over taco seasoning you have? Sprinkle it over popcorn and 
place it on the snack table next to the Taco Mexican mix for another delicious 
snack.</p> 
<p>Spiced Chocolate Almonds<br>
Serve these spicy delicious almonds alone, or 
mix them with 2 to 3 cups of popcorn. This tasty treat is the perfect mix of 
salty and sweet.</p> 
<p>Chocolate-Dipped Pretzel Rods</p> 
<p>Chocolate Dipped Pretzel Rods<br>
Chocolate covered pretzels are hard for 
many to resist. Add a rainbow of candy coated sprinkles and this simple, 
kid-friendly recipe will become a household favourite. An equal amount of white 
chocolate can be substituted in this recipe, if desired.</p> 
<p>Rosemary Oven-Roasted Potato Chips<br>
Get creative and enjoy making your 
own batch of delicious rosemary potato chips.</p>

<h2>8 Cookies You&rsquo;ll Crave</h2> Monday, September 19th, 2011 
<p>Almond Butter Cookies</p> 
<p>We love cookies. They&rsquo;re good to pack in lunches, good at tea time, 
good for a snack and good for the soul. Whether you&rsquo;re into the classics 
(chocolate chip, oatmeal, etc.,) or are looking to try something new (potato 
chips and pecans?), try one of our eight favourite cookies below.</p> 
<p>Almond Butter Cookies<br>
Delicious and buttery melt-in-your-mouth cookies.
</p> 
<p>Iron Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie<br>
A classic favourite cookie gets a 
grown-up makeover with a new cooking surface and some sophisticated salt. The 
result is a gooey and soft middle with crispy bottom and edges.</p> 
<p>Potato Chip Pecan Crunch Cookies<br>
Don&rsquo;t tell anyone there are 
crushed potato chips in the mix so that all they will care about is the buttery 
goodness.</p> 
<p>Raspberry Almond Macarons<br>
This isn&rsquo;t the coconut macaroon many 
people are familiar with. Instead, it&rsquo;s a lovely, light-as-a-feather 
French sandwich cookie, which starts with puffy wafers of ground almonds, 
confectioners&rsquo; sugar and egg white. This version is sealed with a rich, 
pink, raspberry-flavoured buttercream.</p> 
<p>No-Bake Chocolate Cookies<br>
These cookies can be made in just three 
simple steps.</p> 
<p>Oatmeal Cranberry Flaxseed Cookies<br>
These tasty and healthy cookies are 
a real favourite with the kids!&nbsp;Perfect for lunch boxes.</p> 
<p>Confetti Meringues<br>
Perfect for a party!</p> 
<p>Jane&rsquo;s Killer Chocolate Cookies<br>
You truly cannot get much more 
chocolate into a single cookie.</p>
