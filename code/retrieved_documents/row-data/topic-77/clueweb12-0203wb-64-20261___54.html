<p><b>HEALTH</b> is our goal. Anyone can store canned goods. Store foods that 
will build your immune system, give you energy and keep you healthy! The items 
we suggest, to store, are not only the most inexpensive and easiest foods to 
store, but also the<b>BEST</b> foods you can store.</p> 
<p><b>When you eat junk foods, good food has no appeal. As you introduce real 
food into your diet, your taste buds change. You will find you crave sweets 
less, and good food more.</b><br>
<br>
 Recipes are found in the Amazing Wheat 
Book by LeArta Moulton, who has been perfecting whole food cooking, over the 
past 30 years, to make them easy and fast to prepare, with tastes the whole 
family will love.</p> <br>

<p><b>5 FOODS THAT SUSTAIN LIFE<br>
</b><i>Inexpensive and Life Giving<br>
</i>
</p> 
<p><b>The availability and storage life of these 5 foods are excellent. <br>
 
The versatility by which they can be modified, and combined to give<br>
 
variety and palatable food preparations seems never ending</b>.<br>
</p> <br>
 
&nbsp; <b>Basic Whole Food Items to Store</b> Back to top &gt;&gt; <br>
<br>

<br> <b>1. WATER </b>- is more essential than food in sustaining life. Minimum 
amount is 1 gal. per<br>
 day per person. Store a minimum of a 2 weeks supply, 
which would be 14 gallons. (7 gal. for<br>
 drinking and food preparation, and 
an addition 7 gal. per person of the same quality water for<br>
 bathing, 
brushing teeth, and dishwashing). If water from the tap is used and it is 
chlorinated,<br>
 it is not necessary to include Clorox for storing. Use heavy 
plastic containers with tight fitting<br>
 lids. Water purification drops would 
also be important to have. 
<p><b>2. GRAINS/SEEDS </b>- grains include wheat, rice, rolled oats, dried 
corn, pearled barley<br>
 and other cereal grains. Store various grain items 
that suit your individual circumstances.<br>
 Flour, cornmeal, and pasta 
products such as macaroni and spaghetti could also be included.<br>
 Most 
grains can be stored in tightly sealed metal or heavy plastic containers. It 
would be<br>
 wise to store 325 lbs. of a variety of the above. We suggest you 
store about 60 pounds of<br>
 seeds. These can be used in the form of sprouting 
or planting. Only 1 &frac12; cups of a sprouted<br>
 seed per day can sustain 
life very adequately, for as long as you like.</p> 
<p><b>3. HONEY</b> (or substitute) - purchase raw, unfiltered honey when 
possible. Honey which<br>
 has had water added to it (to keep it more liquid 
and easier to pour) should not be used for<br>
 babies, as it can contain a 
bacteria that could be unsafe. Whole honey, is safe for everyone<br>
 and will 
last longer in storage, although it may crystallize and/or darken. Neither 
affects the<br>
 safety of the product. Store in small containers. Then, if it 
crystallizes, you can immerse the<br>
 containers in hot (not boiling) water to 
reliquify it. Store at least 60 lbs. It has been used for<br>
 centuries for 
many medicinal uses.</p> 
<p><b>4. SALT</b> - use a pure, not iodized, product. REAL salt or, a proven 
safe, sea salt is best.<br>
 It can be stored in its original container in a 
cool, dry place. Store other basic seasoning<br>
 mixes for a variety, (such as 
chili powder, spaghetti, taco mixes etc. making your own will<br>
 save a great 
deal of money and eliminate harmful preservatives and chemicals used in most<br>
 mixes)</p> 
<p><b>5. OIL</b> - fat is essential to every diet. Olive oil is by far the 
ultimate oil! It is nutritious, healing<br>
 and has the longest shelf life. 
Use only 100% virgin oil, not light. Cold pressed is the best but<br>
 costs 
more.</p> 
<p><b><i>2 other Important Storage Foods:</i></b></p> 
<p><b>LEGUMES</b> - an inexpensive, nutritious protein food. This could 
include a variety of beans,<br>
 peas, lentils. They can be stored in clean, 
dry metal or plastic containers with tight fitting lids.</p> 
<p><b>POWDERED MILK</b> - although this pasteurized product is not a source of 
calcium, as the<br>
 dairy producers would like you to believe, and because 
many are allergic to it and other dairy<br>
 products, this is not a priority 
on our list; however, we will give you information on it and different<br>
 
ways to prepare, in case it is already in your storage. Use sparingly. You will 
need the non-<br>
 instant dry milk powder to use for making candies, cheeses, 
etc. If you have stored the instant,<br>
 it can be reduced to non instant by 
blending, it in the blender, to a powder form.</p>

</b> If you could only store two foods, <br>
 these 
would be the most important! <br>

<p><b>WATER</b><br>

<b>1</b>. A quart

<b>nstructions for preparing items in List #1</b> 
<p><b>WATER<br>
</b>Water is more essential than food in sustaining life, and 
over the long term needs to be constantly available from an unpolluted source. 
But realistically, in case of severe emergency, plan to have enough water to 
sustain your family for<b>TWO WEEKS.</b></p> 
<p><b>How Much to Store:</b><br>
 Water storage should take top priority in 
emergency preparedness. 1 gallon per day per person is the recommended minimum. 
1/2 gallon (2 quarts) for daily drinking and &frac12; gallon for daily washing. 
Try going without the water from your faucets one day and see how you fare with 
your emergency water supply. You may decide, like we did, to dejunk more 
storage areas and make room for more water!<br>
 Store a minimum of 7 gallons 
of water per person for drinking and food preparation. Store an additional 
seven gallons per person of the same quality water for bathing, brushing teeth, 
and dishwashing. This is approximately 3 gallons per person for 72 hours, or 14 
gallons for 2 weeks.</p> 
<p><b>How to Store:</b><br>
 Water can be stored in any durable non-glass 
container designed to store liquids for extended periods. If you use plastic, 
plan on changing the water every few months, as there is some transfer of toxic 
materials from some plastics to the water. Empty plastic milk jugs are 
food-grade, but they may start leaking over a period of time. Empty and cleaned 
2-liter pop bottles hold up just fine with indoor storage where the temperature 
is more constant; however, a 2-liter bottle that has been in the car-trunk 
during the heat of the summer and extreme cold of winter will eventually start 
to crack. Put a new 2-liter bottle of water in your car trunk at the change of 
extreme hot and extreme cold weather.<br>
</p> 
<p>In summary, use heavy plastic containers with tight fitting lids. Metal 
containers, which may corrode, tend to give water an unpleasant taste. If 
possible, use non-breakable containers for your water storage. You could end up 
without a water supply if all your glass containers are shattered.</p>

<p><b>SEEDS </b>for sprouting</p> 
<p><b>WHY SPROUT?</b><br>
 One of the very best foods you can eat is sprouts. 
Sprouts are live plant foods that are biogenic<br>
 (&quot;life-generating), 
which means they transfer their vital life energy to you! They are packed with
<br> enzymes which aid in digestion and are alkaline-forming. Sprouts can be 
grown in your kitchen<br>
 (from beans, lentils, grains, seeds, almonds) in any 
season, providing you with fresh organic<br>
 produce when no other garden is 
available. They are easy to grow, some in as little as one day.<br>
 Seeds for 
sprouting can be stored for long periods of time and can produce many times 
their<br>
 weight in fresh produce full of vitamins, minerals, and complete 
proteins.</p> 
<p> <br>
<b>Note: 1</b> &frac12;<b> cups a day of mixed sprouts, and alfalfa 
that has had a chance to green up<br>
 a little, will supply you with complete 
nutrition and SUSTAIN LIFE!<br>
</b>A good mix for this would be equal parts of 
Alaska pea (better tasting than the garden pea),<br>
 lentils, mung bean, 
adjuki bean. Half as much of sunflower, fenugreek seed and triticale wheat.<br>

 An excellent combination to put with the alfalfa is red clover, cabbage, and 
radish.<br>
 You can purchase the combination of seeds mentioned above already 
mixed for your<br>
 convenience. Contact Life Sprouts 1-800-241-1516. They are 
organic and guaranteed to sprout.</p> 
<p>They can be eaten alone, in salads, with grains, in sandwiches, gently 
steamed with veggies,<br>
 as a snack, or sprinkled over soup. Everyone should 
store organic sprouting seeds and use<br>
 sprouts in their daily diet. This is 
the best way to eat soy. It is the ideal way to eat all legumes.<br>
 When 
sprouted, they are much easier to digest and will not produce intestinal gas as 
they do<br>
 when cooked.</p> 
<p>During an emergency you will have a number of basic needs such as alternate 
methods of<br>
 cooking; some method of preserving perishable food; and a 
supply of foods that require little<br>
 or no preparation or refrigeration. In 
time of emergency, your source of heat may not be<br>
 available and you will 
be forced to search for an alternate method of heating or using your food.</p> 
<p>Sprouts can sustain you! Don't want to wait until an emergency hits. Start 
now to introduce<br>
 sprouts into your diet. It may be a food you need to get 
use to, but as you do you will learn<br>
 to really enjoy the taste, the energy 
and the feeling of well-being they give you. You probably<br>
 eat as much for 
the pleasure that food brings as you do to satisfy your hunger. Some of the<br>

 suggestions may not meet your special needs, but you can adapt them, with the 
unique and<br>
 healthful recipes given.<br>
</p> 
<p>To experience some simple sprouts, try lentils. Soak 1/3 cup green lentils 
overnight, preferable<br>
 in purified water, in a 1 quart jar. (special 
sprouting jars with drainage lids can be obtained at<br>
 health food stores. 
You could use nylon or fiberglass mesh as a lid, fitted with an elastic band<br>
 or the ring on the canning jar.) In the morning rinse the lentils well with 
fresh water, then pour<br>
 off the water through the lid or mesh. Turn the jar 
to spread the seeds, then leave the jar upside-<br>
 down (tilted at a 45 
degree angle ) in a dark, warm place, to continue draining. Rinse and drain<br>

 the contents of the jar twice a day, once a day, or sometimes I leave it a day 
or two and just<br>
 rinse, drain and let dry out a little before storing in 
the fridge. This will depend on the seed or<br>
 bean you are sprouting. Beans 
take longer to sprout, so they need more rinsing. In 2-3 days<br>
 the sprouts 
will be ready to eat. Store sprouts in the refrigerator in a glass jar, sealed 
plastic<br>
 bag or a plastic container. They will keep for about a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>In Summary</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sprouts are one of the most complete foods known to man, with vitamins, 
proteins, minerals,<br>
 live enzymes, and fiber in their purest form.<br>
</li>
<li>They are a whole food, nutritious, efficient and the most inexpensive 
source of dietary fiber<br>
 available.<br>
</li> 
<li>They taste good raw or cooked, have no waste. Higher than meat in protein 
and the citrus<br>
 fruits in Vit C, at a fraction of the cost!<br>
</li> 
<li>Sprouting makes it easier to digest and adds enzymes that change the 
starches to sugars<br>
 and proteins to amino acids.<br>
</li> 
<li>Sprouting changes the texture of dried beans and legumes so that they can 
be easily chewed<br>
 and digested with little or no cooking.<br>
</li> 
<li>Sprouted grains and beans increase in vitamins A,B,C,E and K. Riboflavin 
and folic acid<br>
 increase up to 13 times the original amount present in the 
dry seeds. Vit.C increases up<br>
 to 600% in some cases. Two of the most 
important amino acids necessary for the body<br>
 to manufacture proteins are 
lysine and tryptophan, which are also increased significantly.<br>
</li> 
<li>They can grow anywhere, needs neither soil nor sunshine, and flourishes in 
any climate,<br>
 during any season of the year, and ready to harvest in 1-5 
days.<br>
</li> 
<li>The volume increases 3-4 times the original amount when sprouted! So, in 
addition to<br>
 adding important enzymes, increasing nutrition, saving time 
and effort in preparing whole<br>
 foods, the yield is even a greater savings 
on your food budget.</li> </ul> 
<p><b><br>
HOW TO SPROUT</b></p> 
<p> <b>Jar Method<br>
</b>Soak<b> </b> 1/3 cup seeds in a 1 quart jar of water 
for 6 hours or overnight. (Special sprouting jars<br>
 with drainage lids can 
be obtained at health food stores. You could use nylon or fiberglass<br>
 mesh 
as a lid, fitted with an elastic band or the ring on the canning jar.)In the 
morning rinse<br>
 the lentils well with fresh water, then pour off the water 
through the lid or mesh.<br>
 Turn the jar to spread the seeds, then leave the 
jar upside-down (tilted at a 45 degree angle )<br>
 in a dark, warm place, to 
continue draining. Rinse and drain the contents of the jar once a day,<br>
 or 
sometimes I leave it a day or two and just rinse, drain and let dry out a 
little before storing<br>
 in the fridge. This will depend on the seed or bean 
you are sprouting. Beans take longer to<br>
 sprout, so they need more rinsing. 
(Sunflower seeds only need 3-6 hrs. soaking and only one<br>
 day of 
sprouting). In 2-3 days the sprouts will be ready to eat. Store sprouts in the 
refrigerator<br>
 in a glass jar, sealed plastic bag or a plastic container. 
They will keep for over a week. Rinse<br>
 and drain occasionally if they are 
not used up within a week.</p> 
<p> <b>Wash Cloth and Plate Method </b><br>
 This is a slower method and to be 
used if a jar or sprouting trays are not available. Place a wash<br>
 cloth or 
terry cloth on a plate. On top of the cloth, sprinkle unsoaked seeds, touching 
each other,<br>
 on top of the cloth and cover with another cloth Rest the 
plate on a shallow pan containing water,<br>
 with one end of the cloth hanging 
down into the water. This will act as a wick and draw up the<br>
 water to keep 
the wheat moist and will sprout.</p> 
<p><br>
<b>Commercial Sprouting Tray Method </b><br>
 For an easy-to-get 
started program on sprouting, we recommend a company dedicated to<br>
 
producing the best possible product in organic, clean pure sprouting seeds, 
grains and beans<br>
 with instructions on how to sprout, and nutritional 
aspects for the different seeds.<br>
 Contact Life Sprouts 1-800-241-1516 </p> 
<p><b>Some of the easiest sprouts to grow are:</b> alfalfa, mung bean, chick 
pea, green or pink<br>
 lentil, sesame, sunflower, almond, buckwheat, and wheat.
<br> <b>A lettuce replacement</b> - equal parts of red clover, cabbage, radish 
and twice the amount<br>
 of alfalfa.<br>
<b>A Good Bean Mix </b>- Equal parts 
of Alaska pea (better tasting than the garden pea),<br>
 lentils, mung bean, 
adjuki bean. Half as much of sunflower, fenugreek seed and triticale<br>
 wheat.
<br> </p> 
<p><b>Note:<br>
 Sprouts are the single most important item left out of our 
diet for healthy living. A good supply of sprouting seeds could be one of the 
most important items in your food storage.</b></p> 
<p></p> <b>These can be eaten alone, in salads, with grains, in sandwiches, 
gently steamed with veggies, as a snack, or sprinkled over soup. Everyone 
should store sprouting seeds and use sprouts in their daily diet. This is also 
the best way to eat soy and the ideal way to eat all legumes. When sprouted, 
they are much easier to digest and will cook in half the time. </b> 
<p><b>We recommend storing 25 lbs.of seed per person, in addition to wheat. 
Stored with<br>
 Diatomaceous earth (which is a natural insect killer). Grain 
seeds will last for 8-10 years or more, depending on the moisture content of 
the grain and atmospheric temperature (must be stored in a cool place for 
successful sprouting). Vegetable seeds are good for only 5-7 years. It is 
important; however, to ariate every 2 years, by pouring the stored seeds into 
another clean bucket and then back again. Seeds are alive and contain oxygen, 
but if they are canned and never ariated, they can die from their own carbon 
dioxide and will not sprout. ROTATE, enjoy this live food now and keep it alive 
for the future. Note: If seeds are canned with an Oxy pack, many will not 
sprout. Those who are in the know urge canneries to not can or use oxy packs 
for grains.</b><br>
</p> <b>RECIPES </b>for List # 1 
<p><br>
<b> Sprouted Wheat Crackers</b><br>
<i>(The method for making sprouted 
wheat crackers and<br>
 cooking in the sun, </i><i>comes from the Dead Sea 
Scrolls)</i></p> 
<p>1 C sprouted wheat (about 1/4 inch long sprout)<br>
 1 tsp. salt or other 
seasoning</p> 
<p>With hand food grinder, using the disk that mashes, or grinds the smallest, 
grind 1 cup<br>
 sprouted wheat. When preparing outdoors, you could pound with 
tamper on hollowed-out<br>
 log or rock.</p> 
<p>Wheat, when it is sprouted, takes on a slightly sweet flavor; however, they 
can become<br>
 quite strong as they get older. The mashed wheat can be 
flavored to make a sweet cracker<br>
 by adding a little cinnamon, honey, brown 
sugar, or sweetener of your choice. For a savory<br>
 cracker, add onion, 
garlic or other herb salts. If sesame seeds are available, sprinkle on<br>
 
rolled out wheat sprout dough before baking.</p> 
<p>Spread mashed mixture onto well greased or Pam'd cookie sheet. Roll out to 
1/8th inch thick.<br>
 You can add sesame seeds, poppy seeds, additional salt 
etc. At this point. Score into squares,<br>
 prick with fork tines a couple of 
times in each square. Bake in 350&deg; oven for 15-20 minutes or<br>
 till 
browned and crispy. For outdoor cooking, spread out on rock or flat wood 
surface in the hot<br>
 sun about 2-3 hours until crisp and crunchy.<br>
<b>
Note:</b> To keep dough from sticking to rolling pin, place freezer paper or 
brown bag paper on<br>
 top of dough, then roll out thin.</p> 
<p><b>Variation by adding flour:</b><br>
 2 cups mashed wheat sprouts<br>
 1/2 
cup whole wheat, or other grain, flour<br>
 1/2 tsp. salt, plus additional 
seasonings if desired<br>
 4 T olive or vegetable oil<br>
 2 T water</p> 
<p>Mix together. Roll out on a cookie sheet. Bake 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees 
or till browned<br>
 and crisp.<br>
</p> 
<p><b> Salads</b><br>
 Add sprouts to a tossed salad or to a blend of grated 
raw<br>
 vegetables (try yams, red beets, turnips, jicama, peeled broccoli 
spears etc. for a delightful<br>
 change) This makes a very nutritious and 
filling meal.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>A Sprout Sweet Treat</b><br>
 Mix two parts wheat sprouts (not older 
than 2-3 days) to one part coconut. This is good<br>
 eaten plain or sprinkled 
over sliced banana, ice cream, pudding etc.</p> 
<p><b>Other Suggested Uses</b></p> 
<p>* Addition to bread dough (ground fine)<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A filling for egg omelets<br>
</li> 
<li>Warmed in butter and seasoning<br>

</p> <b>RECIPES</b> for 
List #2 
<p><br>
<b>1. Cooked Cereal<br>
</b></p> 
<p><b>Using a Thermos Bottle to cook</b><br>
 Warm the thermos first by 
pouring boiling water into it for about 5 minutes.<br>
 Pour this water out and 
add equal amounts of boiling water and whole kernel<br>
 wheat (or any other 
grain) to the warmed thermos. Secure lid and leave overnight<br>
 or at least 
for 8-10 hours. The kernels will be large and tender</p> 
<p> <b>On Top of Stove</b> (for Cracked Wheat).<br>
 Cracked wheat is wheat 
kernels that have been very coarsely ground.<br>
 Sift out any flour found in 
cracked wheat by shaking it through a fine wire<br>
 strainer (these fine 
particles can be used in other recipes and makes a quick<br>
 cream of wheat 
cereal).<br>
 1 C cracked wheat<br>
 1 3/4 C water<br>
 1 tsp. salt (add after 
wheat has cooked)</p> 
<p>Place water and cracked wheat in heavy sauce pan, bring to full boil, 
cover, turn<br>
 off heat and let stand 15 minutes or till water is absorbed.
<br> <b>Note:</b> This cooked cracked grain makes a flaky, tender breakfast 
cereal. It can be<br>
 used in place of meat, rice dishes and other recipes to 
replace a ground meat.</p> 
<p><b>On Top of Stove</b> (for Cream of Wheat)<br>
<br>
<b>Stir together:</b>
<br> 1 C coarse flour (a germade or farina texture)<br>
 1 C cool water<br>
 In 
a sauce pan bring to boil:<br>
 1 C water</p> 
<p>Gradually add the first mixture stirring continuously on a low boil until 
thick, about<br>
 1 minute. Add salt and honey to taste. Serve with milk or 
juice.</p> 
<p><b>Steamed and dried for Rolled Oats, wheat etc.<br>
</b>Steam the desired 
grain, for rolling, until tender. Roll thin with a heavy rolling pin.<br>
 Dry 
flakes out in the oven.</p> 
<p><b>2. Meat Replacement<br>
</b>Use cooked crack wheat for a ground meat 
replacement. (could also use cooked<br>
 black or red rice) add to any dish.</p>
<p><b>3. Salads</b> (using sprouted seeds)<br>
 Make a dressing with your 
seasoning blends and olive oil.</p> 
<p><b>4. Trail Mix </b>(Popped grains and seeds)<br>
 In a heavy fry pan (with 
no oil) over medium-high heat, pop (stirring and/or shaking<br>
 constantly) 1 
cup each of any or all of the following until lightly browned and popping<br>
 
sounds have almost stopped: Dry whole wheat kernels (soft wheat is more tender),
<br> raw, green pumpkin seeds (called Oriental or Pepita pumpkin seeds), and 
raw, hulled<br>
 sunflower seeds. Mix together, add &frac12; teaspoon oil and 
season with salt, onion or garlic<br>
 salt, herb seasonings, or any seasoning 
of your choice.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>5. Hot Drink</b><br>
 Use the popped method, #4 above, for developing 
parched wheat.<br>
 Place &frac12; cup or less wheat kernels in fry pan on high 
heat, stirring constantly until the<br>
 wheat gets quite dark. Crack in 
blender or nut mill. Add 1-2 teaspoons parched wheat to<br>
 1 cup boiling 
water. Let steep, strain and serve with milk and honey. Note: for a variety in
<br> your wheat drink, add parched barley and rye to the parched wheat. This 
makes a blend<br>
 similar to postum.<br>
<b>Note:</b> you can add parched 
wheat to liquids for darkening broths and gravies.</p> 
<p><b>6. Wheat Chips</b><br>
 Similar to potato chips and made from whole wheat
<br> 1 C whole wheat flour<br>
 2 C water</p> 
<p>Mix together and season to taste with one of the following:<br>
 1/2 tsp. 
each onion and garlic salt<br>
 1 tsp. salt or vegetable salt substitute<br>
 
3-4 T parmesan cheese (optional)<br>
 1 T of any seasoning The Amazing Wheat 
book (i.e.,taco, barbecue, onion etc.).</p> 
<p>Stir ingredients together. Pour mixture into squirt bottle, as shown in the 
Quick Wholesome<br>
 Foods video,and squirt onto nonstick sprayed cookie sheet 
in potato chip shapes. Sprinkle<br>
 with toasted sesame seeds if desired. <br>

 Bake at 350&deg; for 10-15 minutes or until crisp. Check occasionally and turn 
chips over if middle<br>
 is not cooking as fast as the outside. <br>
<b>Note: 
</b>the thinner the batter, the more crisp the chips.</p> 
<p>For cold cereal flakes: season batter only with salt to taste and a little 
sweetening if desired.<br>
 Bake as above for Wheat Chips</p> 
<p><b>7. Powdered Milk Candy</b><br>
 (Honey taffy) <br>
 In a heavy sauce pan 
boil 2 C honey to the hard ball stage, 250&deg; on medium heat, stirring<br>
 
constantly, (4-5 minutes). Take off heat Add 1 T butter and 1 teaspoon soda 
(optional). Flavor<br>
 with 12 drops oil of anise or your choice of flavor 
(also optional). Pour onto a buttered surface.<br>
 When cool enough to handle, 
butter hands and start pulling as you do for taffy. When honey<br>
 holds its 
shape and is a golden color, twist into ropes and place back on the counter top 
or<br>
 baking sheet and cut into pieces with scissors. Wrap individually with 
wax paper.<br>
<br>
 (<b>Basic candy</b>)<br>
 1 &frac12; cups non instant dry 
milk<br>
 &frac12; cup honey (whipped honey works well in this recipe)<br>
 See 
also &quot;Good For You Treats&quot; in theAdditional Recipes Section. </p> 
<p> Stir and knead enough dry milk into the honey to make a firm ball. Stretch 
and<br>
 form into pencil size rolls. Let stand 3-4 hours. If rolls flatten 
out, gather up and<br>
 knead more milk into it. Form into rolls and let stand 
again. Cut into bite-size<br>
 pieces. If candy is to be stored, let pieces 
stand to dry slightly (to prevent sticking)<br>
 before piling on top of each 
other.<br>
 Variations: <br>
 Add peanut butter, nuts, coconut, dried fruit, 
carob, flavorings, food coloring,<br>
 chocolate or carob chips, or crispy rice 
cereal. Add flavorings and food coloring to<br>
 honey and mix well before 
adding the dry milk. Try 3 drops oil of peppermint and<br>
 &frac14; teaspoon 
green food coloring; &frac12; teaspoon raspberry or strawberry flavoring and<br>
 &frac14; teaspoon red food coloring; &frac12; teaspoon black walnut flavoring.
</p> 
<p><b>8. Homemade Yeast</b><br>
 Mix together 1 C each whole wheat flour, warm 
water and 2 tsp. honey. Place in bottle,<br>
 leave uncovered. Stir several 
times a day for 5 days in a warm room. There will be small<br>
 bubbles<br>
 
coming to the top and it will have a yeasty aroma.<br>
 To keep it going: feed 
the starter after the 5th day (to replace what you have used) by<br>
 adding 
equal parts flour an water (or potato water). In 24 hours the yeast will be 
ready<br>
 again.<br>
 Store unused yeast in fridge with tight lid. Shake it 
often. To activate it before using<br>
 again add 2-3 tablespoons each flour 
and water and stir.</p> 
<p><b>9. Sourdough Bread </b><br>
<b>Ingredients:</b><br>
 1 cup yeast (from 
homemade yeast) 2 tsp. salt<br>
 2 cups warm water 2 T dry milk<br>
 3 &frac12; 
cups flour 1 T honey<br>
 Mix well, place ball of soft dough in a nest of 
flour. Knead in only enough flour to keep<br>
 mixture from sticking. Develop 
the gluten for 10 min. by kneading or pounding. Place the<br>
 satin-smooth 
dough to rise for about 5 hours at room temperature, about 72 degrees or<br>
 
until it doubles in bulk. (5 hours is the usually time for sour dough to raise.
<br> Shape into 3 oval loaves or use small bread pans about 3 &frac12; &quot; x 
7 &frac12;&quot;. Allow to rise again<br>
 for about 3 hours. Bake 1 hour at 
325 degrees.</p> 
<p><b>10. Dutch Oven Bread<br>
</b>With a hand-crank wheat mill, it takes 
about 30 minutes to grind enough wheat into flour<br>
for 3 loaves of bread. 
When cooking and doing dishes without the modern kitchen, you will<br>
 want to 
keep the effort and mess to a minimum. The Dutch oven works well enough to mix
<br> the ingredients, knead the dough, let it rise mix the ingredients with a 
potato masher.<br>
 Depending on the weather, wind and temperature outside you 
will need about 4-5 coals<br>
 underneath for rising the dough. Rising time, 
about thirty minutes. Let the dough rise only<br>
 once, then increase the 
coals for cooking. For cooking use 8 to 10 briquettes under and 12<br>
 to 14 
on top. Cooking time is approximately 35 minutes. If the bread is too moist you 
can<br>
 crack the lid for the last 5 to 10 minutes of the cooking time.</p> 
<p><b>Recipe: </b><br>
 4 1/2 cups warm water<br>
 1/3 cup oil <br>
 2 T salt 
<br> 3 T yeast- added to 1/2 cup warm water and 1T honey<br>
 11-12 cups flour
</p> 
<p>In a 14 inch dutch oven mix together with a potato masher and work with 
hands into a<br>
 manageable dough. Follow cooking instructions above.<br>
<b>
Note</b>: Use vegetable oil on hands to keep dough from sticking</p> 
<p><b>11. Unleavened Bread</b><br>
<i>(This is also called Matzah - </i><i>the 
Hebrew<br>
 name for unleavened bread)</i></p> 
<p>3 cups matzah meal (or a flour the texture of corn meal)<br>
 water (enough 
to make it pliable)<br>
 pinch of salt</p> 
<p>Knead together until soft and fine. Divide into 3 parts. Roll out thin like 
a pie crust.<br>
 Set on a teflon or lightly oiled (olive or vegetable oil 
only- to be kosher) cookie sheet<br>
 and use a fork to lightly puncture the 
dough. Bake immediately at 400 until lightly<br>
 browned. May be turned over, 
bake until brown. Don't break. You could bake this in<br>
 a loaf pan or in a 
round ball.</p>

<p> Heat honey and peanut butter in heavy saucepan over low heat to a very 
soft,<br>
 creamy texture, stir constantly or it will burn. Pour into bowl of 
the powdered milk<br>
 and stir till thoroughly mixed, kneading with hands 
until pliable. (At this point,<br>
 if you have any of the following, you may 
add: dried chopped fruit, nuts, seeds,<br>
 coconut, carob or chocolate chips, 
rice crispies etc.)<br>
 Roll into balls or pat down in cookie sheets, baking 
pans, or anything flat with sides.<br>
 Score<br>
 into squares with warmed 
knife. Put in fridge or freezer till cool and slightly<br>
 firm. To keep firm, 
store in cool place.<br>
<b>Note:</b> For a more firm texture add 1/4-1/2 C 
more dry powdered milk.</p> 
<p><b>Variations:</b><br>
 * Press an almond in each cut square, a large 
chocolate chip, dried fruit bits etc.<br>
 before putting in the refrigerator.
<br> * Roll small balls in toasted coconut or chopped nuts<br>
 * Chopped dried 
fruit and seeds may be added<br>
 * Add carob powder to the basic mixture or 
baking cocoa<br>
 * 2 C puffed rice cereal mixed in basic recipe is very good.

<b>&nbsp;Storing Water</b> Back to top &gt;&gt; <br>
<br>

<p>Water is more essential than food in sustaining life, and over the long 
term needs to be constantly available from an unpolluted source. But 
realistically, in case of severe emergency, plan to have enough water to 
sustain your family for<b>TWO WEEKS</b>.</p> 
<p><b>How Much to Store:</b><br>
 Water storage should take top priority in 
emergency preparedness. 1 gallon per day per person is the recommended minimum. 
1/2 gallon (2 quarts) for daily drinking and &frac12; gallon for daily washing. 
Try going without the water from your faucets one day and see how you fare with 
your emergency water supply. You may decide, like we did, to dejunk more 
storage areas and make room for more water!<br>
 Store a minimum of 7 gallons 
of water per person for drinking and food preparation. Store an additional 
seven gallons per person of the same quality water for bathing, brushing teeth, 
and dishwashing. This is approximately 3 gallons per person for 72 hours, or 14 
gallons for 2 weeks.</p> 
<p><b>How to Store:</b><br>
 Water can be stored in any durable non-glass 
container designed to store liquids for extended periods. If you use plastic, 
plan on changing the water every few months, as there is some transfer of toxic 
materials from some plastics to the water. Empty plastic milk jugs are 
food-grade, but they may start leaking over a period of time. Empty and cleaned 
2-liter pop bottles hold up just fine with indoor storage where the temperature 
is more constant; however, a 2-liter bottle that has been in the car-trunk 
during the heat of the summer and extreme cold of winter will eventually start 
to crack. Put a new 2-liter bottle of water in your car trunk at the change of 
extreme hot and extreme cold weather.<br>
</p> 
<p>In summary, use heavy plastic containers with tight fitting lids. Metal 
containers, which may corrode, tend to give water an unpleasant taste. If 
possible, use non-breakable containers for your water storage. You could end up 
without a water supply if all your glass containers are shattered.</p> 
<p><b>Water Treatment:</b><br>
 8 drops of chlorine bleach per gallon of water 
can be added If the tap water you are storing is not already chlorinated from 
the public water supply. If the tap water you use is already chlorinated, just 
put that water directly into you clean, food-grad container with out adding 
extra chlorine bleach. USU research indicates that the water should last for at 
least 10 years. However, if you store the water in a glass container that has a 
cardboard liner in the lid, the cardboard will disintegrate and create off 
flavors and off odors. So, if you have such a water-storage container, take the 
cardboard liner out before you store water.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you have any doubt as to the bacterial safety of stored water, you may 
purify it by boiling vigorously for 1-2 minutes, or as mentioned, by adding 
chlorine bleach. Generally, &frac12; a teaspoon of bleach will purify 5 gallons 
of clear water, and 1 teaspoon will purify 5 gallons of cloudy water. If you 
store it away from sunlight in clean containers, and if it is safe bacterially 
at the time of storage, water will remain pure indefinitely.</p> 
<p>To be safe for culinary use, water must be rendered chemically and 
biologically harmless. The right water purifier would remove harmful bacteria, 
protozoa, amoebae, viruses, fibers, sediment (microscopic particles of dirt, 
rust, scale, radioactive particles etc.), organics, and other agents such as 
chlorine and radioactive gasses. The best type use ceramic cartridges, sup 
glass and/or carbon for filtering with silver, iodine or chlorine to kill 
bacteria. Some are more effective than others. Systems using iodine probable 
give the most complete bacteriological protection. Even those using essentially 
only mechanical filters with a small pore size are very effective. In the event 
of nuclear war, when fallout is a problem, the dissolved and undissolved 
radiation particles should be removed from the water to the greatest extent 
possible before other purification measures are taken. Activated carbon 
contained in many of the purification devices will remove moist of these 
contaminates. Contact Alan South for the ideal water-purifiers 1-877-767-4382
</p> 
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><br>
 If a disaster disrupts the electricity needed to 
pump the water to your home, there should be a sufficient amount for drinking 
and food preparation stored within the pipes in the house to last for a short 
period , if used sparingly. Water can be drawn from the lowest faucet in the 
house (usually the water heater or water tank) if the highest facet is opened a 
bit to let air into the pipes.</p> 
<p>Remember that canned fruit and fruit juices also have a high content, and 
their liquid can count as part of your water supply. Individual cartons of 
fruit or fruit juice are great for a 72-hour kit.</p> 
<p>A carrying strap that is attached to the top of your own 1-liter or 2-liter 
of water can also be useful. If you don't have one from an emergency 
preparedness store, a heavy string or strip of fabric could easily be 
substituted.</p> 
<p><b>Other Sources of Water:</b><br>
Lakes, ponds, ditches, and streams all 
have water, but it should be rendered safe before being used. Springs, seeps, 
appropriately-located cisterns, and wells can also be good sources of water. 
Even a small solar still could provide some drinking water until other sources 
could be developed. See Sense of Survival for diagrams and instructions on 
making water filters, a well, improvised well pump and finding water in the 
desert.</p> <br>
