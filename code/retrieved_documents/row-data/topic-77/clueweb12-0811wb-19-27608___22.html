<h2>Versatile Smoothie Recipe</h2>  March 2nd, 2012 by The Leftover Queen <br>

Pin it <br>
<br>

<p>This recipe is kitty approved!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I have been posting a lot recently on my Facebook Page about my post 
workout Pumpkin Smoothies and those posts have created quite a buzz! I am a 
huge pumpkin freak and I enjoy it all year long &ndash; seems like a lot of you 
are too! I don&rsquo;t know what I enjoy better, my workouts or these smoothies 
afterwards- the best of both worlds! This smoothie is great way to get in some 
extra grain-free carbohydrates, fat and protein post workout.</p> 
<p>That said, many times when I post a specific recipe, I get a lot of great 
comments like:<em>&ldquo;can I substitute Y ingredient for X ingredient?&rdquo;
</em> or <em>&ldquo;I wish I could make that, but I don&rsquo;t consume X 
ingredient&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;I wish I could make this but I don&rsquo;t 
know where to get X ingredient&rdquo;</em> or simply <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t 
like X ingredient&rdquo;</em>. You get the gist&hellip;so although I will post 
my awesome pumpkin smoothie with options and add ins, I will also give you 
ideas for entirely different smoothie recipes. This is mix and match folks! </p>
<p>This is <strong>your</strong> smoothie recipe &ndash; easy to tailor to 
your tastes and needs. I give some suggestions, but feel free to improvise. 
Like chocolate? Add a TBS or two of fair trade cocoa powder (no sugar added). 
Don&rsquo;t do sugar? Try stevia, or fruit sweetened smoothies &ndash; dried 
dates are great for this. Want to make it a greenie? Add a handful of spinach 
or kale. The possibilities are endless!</p> 
<p>Here are some of my recent combinations:</p> 
<p>raw milk, pumpkin, 1/2 banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a little stevia
<br> raw milk, egg, pumpkin puree, almond butter, cinnamon and molasses<br>
 
coconut milk, avocado, cocoa powder, cinnamon, maple<br>
 kefir, soaked 
almonds, dried dates/figs, frozen berries, vanilla extract</p> 
<p>This smoothie recipe is so versatile you can enjoy it for breakfast, a 
snack, dessert or part of any meal when you need an extra boost.</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong> per smoothie (@ 16 oz)</p> 
<p><strong>Base liquid</strong>: 1 cup liquid &ndash; Kefir, Raw Milk, Coconut 
Milk are good choices<br>
<strong>Thickener</strong>: 1 banana &ndash; I also 
like using instead 1/2 avocado<br>
<strong>Nuts:</strong> 3 TBS almond butter 
&ndash; you can use any other nut butter or a handful of soaked nuts &ndash; I 
usually use almonds &ndash;click here to understand about the benefits of 
soaking nuts<br>
<strong>Sweetener</strong>: 1 TBS 100% pure maple syrup, honey 
or molasses or 1/8 &ndash; &frac14; tsp or one or two dried dates (optional)<br>
<strong>Optional add ins</strong>: &frac14; cup of pumpkin puree, 1/4 yogurt, 
1/4 berries, 2 TBS cocoa powder, kale or spinach, dash of cinnamon, 1 shot of 
espresso or &frac14; cup of coffee, 1 TBS coconut oil, raw pastured raised 
chicken egg (do not use conventional eggs from the grocery store), vanilla 
extract, powdered ginger, nutmeg, etc.<br>
 Ice</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Place all the liquids in your blender first. 
Then add the fruit, butters, oils and nuts and then the cinnamon. Process on 
medium speed until well mixed, then start adding ice, a handful at a time, 
gradually, until the smoothie is at your desired consistency. I usually turn up 
the speed to high during the ice process. Pour and enjoy!</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Oladyi : Russian Yogurt Pancakes</h2>  February 24th, 2012 by The Leftover 
Queen <br>
Pin it <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>(Oladyi topped with currants)</p> 
<p>Yes, I realize that I missed International Pancake Day, but then again, I 
am not usually one to follow the herd. In fact, I have been meaning to post 
about these pancakes for a while because we have been enjoying them more times 
than not on Pancake Sunday- so I thought posting them on a Friday could get you 
thinking about making these for a wonderful weekend breakfast!</p> 
<p>Pancake Sunday is a tradition in our house. It came from those dark days 
when I was both gluten and egg free for a time and ended up crying over 
pancakes. Yes, crying, and this folks is why I will never give up eggs again. 
But what I was so upset about was missing pancakes, the girl who grew up never 
liking pancakes, but went to live in Norway and fell in love with them. It is 
funny the things you miss the most when you can&rsquo;t have them. This is when 
I realized pancakes needed to be celebrated on a weekly basis and not a Sunday 
has gone by without them since.</p> 
<p>So in my journey to find amazing, delicious gluten free pancakes, we have 
tried many kinds and have found some favorites:<strong>Buckwheat Pancakes
</strong>, <strong>Coconut Flour Pancakes</strong>, <strong>Norske Pannekakker
</strong>&nbsp; (grain free) and for those of you who are not gluten-free I 
suggest<strong>Sourdough Crepes</strong> and <strong>Aebelskiver</strong>.</p> 
<p>Recently we have added Oladyi to our list and currently these are the 
reigning favorites! I got this recipe from my friend Sofya, who blogs over at
<em><strong>The Girl&rsquo;s Guide to Guns and Butter</strong></em> . I made a 
few changes to her recipe to make them gluten free, so you can feel free to do 
them either way, depending on your dietary needs. These pancakes are referred 
to in this house as &ldquo;the pancakes that eat themselves&rdquo; &ndash; they 
are light, airy and disappear quickly! They are also good if you make more than 
you will eat and put the extras in the freezer to have later in the week. This 
way they can also be a quick and easy mid-week breakfast.</p> 
<p>Sofya says that these pancakes are great to make when your yogurt is 
starting to go bad. So if you are thinking it is time to use up some old 
yogurt, these are a perfect way to enjoy it!</p> 
<p><strong>Oladyi: The Russian Yogurt Pancakes</strong> (adapted from <em>
<strong>A Girl&rsquo;s Guide to Guns and Butter</strong></em> )</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>2 C plain yogurt (going bad OK) &ndash; I usually use up my filmj&ouml;lk 
before it is time to make another batch<br>
 enough flour to make a 
medium-thick batter (one that holds its shape but is still a liquid rather than 
a paste) &ndash; I usually use about 1 &frac12; cups of freshly ground 
buckwheat flour.<br>
 2 eggs<br>
 2 TBS honey, maple or even molasses<br>
 
&frac14; tsp salt<br>
 1 tsp baking soda<br>
 butter for frying</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Mix flour and yogurt together and let rest 
overnight (I leave it out on the counter). Next morning preheat cast iron 
skillet or pancake grill. Mix in the rest of the ingredients (add more flour if 
needed). Heat butter in the skillet and spoon the batter in. I usually use 1/3 
cup for each pancake. Cook until you see bubbles and flip. When I make 
pancakes, I usually preheat my oven to 200-250 F and place cooked pancakes on a 
cookie sheet in the oven to keep warm while the others cook. Serves 4 or 2 
people with leftovers. Recipe is easily doubled!</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Hunter&rsquo;s Chicken and Clapshot</h2>  February 20th, 2012 by The 
Leftover Queen <br>
Pin it <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Once you become a farmer (and a hunter) certain things you never would have 
thought of before become hysterical. Like the idea of &ldquo;Chicken<em>
Cacciatore</em>&rdquo; or Hunter&rsquo;s Chicken. When chickens become part of 
your life, you start to imagine how a dish like this ever came to be, as 
&ldquo;hunting&rdquo; for chickens really makes no sense &ndash; there are very 
few wild chickens in the world, and raising animals for meat hardly equates to 
being a hunter. Historically, the dish seems to have been made with rabbit, 
which definitely makes more sense but it seems that even in Italy, where the 
dish originated, chicken is often used. For me it is just another reminder of 
how detached we are as a society from where our food actually comes from.</p> 
<p>Semantics and doom aside, this dish is a definite favorite all over the 
world. In fact, the recipe I used to make this version of Hunter&rsquo;s 
Chicken, is from one of my favorite cookbooks &ndash;Scottish Traditional 
Recipes: A Celebration of the Food and Cooking of Scotland.</p> 
<p>A picture of the recipe even graces the front cover of the cookbook! 
However, this recipe seems to me to be a bit of a cross between the Italian<em>
Pollo alla Cacciatora</em>and the French <em>Coq au Vin</em>. Perhaps because 
the Scottish and French had a very famous historical alliance, it is likely the 
Scots also learned about the cuisine and culture of the French. Since I was 
using a Scottish recipe for this dish, I decided to pair it with Clapshot 
&ndash; a mixture of mashed potatoes and golden turnips (or in this case a 
rutabaga), a classic Scottish side dish. I also used the Italian classic, 
Chianti wine to prepare the dish.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>No matter the origins of this favorite dish, it is perfect hearty fare for 
the end of winter, or a quick spring cold-snap. The best is that most of you 
probably have all the ingredients already available in your freezer or pantry! 
Making this a quick and easy dish to prepare in a snap!</p> 
<p>You can prepare it in a Dutch oven, cast iron skillet, or as I did, in my 
Tagine.</p> 
<p>*This is also a good time to remind you, if you are interested in following 
my homesteading activities, please check out my blog<strong>Got Goats (and 
sheep too)?</strong> and the corresponding <strong>facebook page</strong>!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Hunter&rsquo;s Chicken</strong> (adapted from <em>Scottish 
Traditional Recipes</em>)</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>2 TBS olive oil<br>
 1 TBS butter<br>
 Half a chicken (or 4 chicken 
portions, like whole legs)<br>
 1 large onion, thinly sliced<br>
 14 oz can of 
chopped tomatoes<br>
 2/3 cup of dry red wine<br>
 1 garlic clove, crushed<br>
 
1 rosemary sprig finely chopped<br>
 4 oz. fresh field mushrooms (or 
portabellos), thinly sliced<br>
 Salt and pepper to taste</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Heat oven to 350 F. Heat the oil and butter 
in the vessel you will be using to cook the dish. Add the chicken and fry for 5 
minutes, remove chicken from the pan and drain in paper towels. Add the sliced 
onion to the pan and cook gently, stirring often for about 3 minutes, then stir 
in the tomatoes and red wine. Add the crushed garlic and chopped rosemary; 
bring to a boil stirring constantly. Return the chicken to the casserole, turn 
to coat with the sauce, cover with a tight fitting lid. At this point you can 
either keep it stove top and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or you can add the 
mushrooms, season the dish with salt and pepper and place in the oven for about 
45 minutes. Serve with Clapshot (see recipe below).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Clapshot</strong> (adapted from <em>Scottish Traditional Recipes
</em>)</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>1 lb of potatoes<br>
 1 lb of rutabaga (swede)<br>
 &frac14; cup butter<br>

 &frac14; cup milk or cream<br>
 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg<br>
 Salt and 
pepper<br>
<strong><br>
 METHOD:</strong><br>
 Peel potatoes and rutabaga, then 
cut into evenly small chunks. Place the cut vegetables in a pan and cover with 
water, add about a tsp of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce 
heat and simmer until both vegetables are soft, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the 
vegetables through a colander, return to the pan and allow the vegetables to 
dry out a bit over low heat, stirring often to prevent sticking. Melt butter 
with the milk in a small pan over low heat. Mash the dry potato and rutabaga 
mixture, then add the milk mixture. Grate the nutmeg and mix thoroughly, season 
to taste with salt and pepper.</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Black Bean Brownies (gluten, grain and dairy free!)</h2>  February 13th, 
2012 byThe Leftover Queen <br>
Pin it <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>After my rant last week, I decided to start off this week with something 
sweeter and right in time for Valentine&rsquo;s Day!<em>Black Bean Brownies</em>
. If you have been following blogs for any amount of time, it is likely that 
you have stumbled across these guys at some point. Maybe if you are like me, 
you have been intrigued to try them, but haven&rsquo;t quite gotten around to 
making them yet.</p> 
<p>Well I am here to tell you that if you think beans have no place in baked 
goods; you are seriously missing out on some deliciously protein packed healthy 
treats. Don&rsquo;t think these are for you? How about if I say you can have 
brownies for breakfast? Do I have you attention now?</p> 
<p>I am actually no stranger to baking with beans, if you have the The Spunky 
Coconut Grain-Free Baked Goods and Desserts cookbook (and if you don&rsquo;t I 
would seriously consider getting it!), Kelly bakes a lot with beans, and this 
cookbook has literally changed my life. Instead of feeling full and tired after 
eating baked goods, I feel energized! Her recipes are amazing, easy to make and 
so tasty, they are also &ldquo;fool proof&rdquo; if you are new to gluten or 
grain free baking and trying to learn how in the world you can bake without 
either of these ingredients, this is a great book!</p> 
<p>I did a search through some cookbooks and several blogs looking for the 
perfect recipe for Black Bean Brownies, but as usual, I didn&rsquo;t find the 
perfect one, so of course, I kind of went out on my own and created a recipe 
inspired by the many that are already out there.</p> 
<p>See, in the great debate about brownies, I fall in the cakey vs. fudgy side 
of things. If you don&rsquo;t like cakey brownies, I think you will still love 
these, and it will become a go-to recipe for making healthy and delicious 
chocolate cake. In fact I plan to make them in the very near future as a cake, 
and use some kind of wonderful real food icing on top.</p> 
<p>I brought these to a social gathering and everyone absolutely loved them! 
They couldn&rsquo;t believe there were beans in them for one, but were equally 
surprised to find out there are no gluten or grains either! Personally, I love 
the super dark, rich look of these brownies. Plus, they are so good for you; 
you can absolutely have them for breakfast with no guilt. So make a batch for 
your valentine&rsquo;s this year.</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>2 cups black beans cooked<br>
 1/3 cup coconut oil<br>
 &frac12; cup honey, 
warmed<br>
 2 tsp pure vanilla extract<br>
 3 eggs<br>
 &frac14; tsp sea salt
<br> 1 tsp Dandy Blend &ndash; Instant Dandelion Beverage Single Servings 
&ndash; 25 Packet(s) (an instant caffeine free coffee substitute or you could 
use instant espresso)<br>
 &frac12; tsp cinnamon<br>
 1 &frac12; tsp baking 
soda (if you like your brownies &ldquo;fudgy&rdquo; you could experiment by 
leaving this out)<br>
 &frac34; cup dutch processed cocoa powder</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Preheat oven to 350 F. Place all ingredients 
in a food processor. Blend until thoroughly mixed. Pour into a prepared 
9&times;9 inch baking dish. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Your knife may not come out 
clean, but the top will look crackly like brownies usually do.</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Turkish Eggs and A RANT!</h2>  February 10th, 2012 by The Leftover Queen 
<br> Pin it <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Turkish Eggs: Simple, Healthy, Cost Effective Food. For Everyone.</p> 
<p>The world of Real Food has become a very confusing environment lately. In 
fact, I am having a hard time keeping track of all the changes and frankly 
getting tired doing so because it all seems to be based on flight of fancy!</p> 
<p>There is Paleo and Primal, Raw, Vegan, Vegetarian, Blood Type diet, Slow 
Carb, Low Carb and everything in between and everyone is fighting with each 
other about what you should eat! Some people say avoid carbs (they are in 
everything from fruits and veggies to grains), others say avoid sugar, even in 
fruit &ndash; or only eat fruit on an empty stomach, or only eat sugar with fat 
and protein to keep insulin levels in check! So which is it? Lately too, I see 
the demonizing of olive oil to endorse butter and lard- Olive oil which has 
been around as long as butter at least and a staple of all Mediterranean diets 
for millennia. Why can&rsquo;t we just say they are all good fats? It is enough 
to make you completely crazy. I don&rsquo;t believe in cutting out whole food 
groups. Our ancestors didn&rsquo;t, why should we? I guess that is why I follow
<strong>WAPF</strong> for the most part, because it is a very balanced diet 
that makes sense.</p> 
<p>For my own example sometimes when I talk to people who are Paleo about 
health issues, they seem to immediately assume that because I eat dairy, that 
is my problem and negate all the other eating habits I follow that are 
virtually the same as theirs. But, I have 100% northern European DNA and 
because my ancestors have a long history with dairy animals (at least 10,000 
years &ndash; as this is when cattle were domesticated) our genes actually 
mutated to be able to consume and digest dairy! So if I want to eat like my 
ancestors, dairy is going to be a cornerstone of that diet. It is literally my 
birthright to do so.</p> 
<p>I have a gluten allergy and have a hard time digesting grains. So I 
don&rsquo;t eat many of them, although the ones I do eat, I eat a good amount 
of, like buckwheat. If I could eat wheat I would (I can get wheat and spelt 
locally. But coconut flour, which I love and eat often, is not at all local 
&ndash; so I struggle with that).</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think wheat it is killing the world. In fact, as I have been 
discussing all over the web in recent weeks, Italians (and likely others, 
although Italy is what I am familiar with) eat copious amounts of it in the 2 
mainstays of their diet &ndash; pasta and bread and have a very healthy 
population. In fact, Sardinians, are some of the longest lived peoples in the 
world! So how does that jive with the whole wheat as the grim reaper argument? 
There has to be other factors, like variety of wheat, the co-mingling with GMO 
crops, pesticides and the like.</p> 
<p>Lots of paleo folks out there eat coconut oil and coconut flour, but what 
caveman was producing those items for their diet? So many questions and not 
enough answers.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the answers, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone does at this 
point.</p> 
<p><strong>So what the heck DO you eat?</strong> I eat whole FRESH foods, much 
of which I raise or grow myself or buy locally. I don&rsquo;t eat packaged or 
processed foods or artificial sweeteners. I stay away from GMOs and MSG. I 
watch my sugar intake and if I have chips or something like that, I make sure 
they are organic. I make sure to have a balanced diet &ndash; I eat from all 
the food groups. I take care in cooking and preparing meals. I never eat fast 
food. I eat a lot of fermented and cultured foods to promote digestion and keep 
my gut healthy. I enjoy my food. I care about where is comes from, how the 
animal lived or how the plant or grain was grown before it came to my plate. I 
am a conscious consumer.<strong>I think these are all important things, in fact 
more important that the specific foods you are eating.</strong> So long as you 
are paying attention to the rest you are likely much healthier than the 
majority of the people out there.</p> 
<p>It has come to me that a lot of people seem to treat food habits like 
religion these days. But the reality is, there is no simple answer, there is no 
magic bullet. Our world is so toxic these days from chemicals, pesticides, 
GMOs, additives, preservatives, pollution, etc. that we cannot expect to have 
the same health that our ancestors did and sometimes we cannot reach optimum 
health on food alone. Many in the Real Food culture give people the impression 
that if &ldquo;you just do it right&rdquo; you will be a perfect human, free of 
health issues, as energetic and strong as a superhero, popping out babies left 
and right, etc. But I don&rsquo;t think that is reasonable for many of us. Some 
of us need extra help along the way &ndash; supplements and what not and there 
is no shame in that.</p> 
<p>Some of us don&rsquo;t do well with gluten or a lot of sugar and grains and 
for a lot of us it is because our bodies need to heal. Maybe in time we will be 
able to have those things again as part of a balanced diet. So please 
don&rsquo;t be harsh with us about our choices, be compassionate, try to help 
but be kind, many people deal with all kinds of food issues and can easily be 
triggered by these kinds of arguments over what is &ldquo;right&rdquo;.<em>
Right for who?</em> For you? Great, go with it, but please stop insinuating 
that your way is the only way or the BEST, because I can probably find just as 
many people who say it isn&rsquo;t for them! Please get off your pulpit, 
preaching to everyone. There is DNA, environmental factors, stress, physiology, 
lifestyle to consider in every single person when trying to decide what is best 
to fuel their individual bodies.</p> 
<p><strong>STRESS</strong> is the real enemy and stressing about how to feed 
yourself, one of the fundamental blocks of life will be a struggle every day, 
several times a day if you can&rsquo;t come to some sort of peace with it all. 
Provided that you don&rsquo;t have an allergy, the stress of this will kill you 
faster than carbs, dairy or whatever is the taboo food of the day.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p> 
<p>I want to finish this post on a high note and give a good example of 
simple, easy to prepare healthy food. This recipe comes from (but slightly 
modified) the cookbookPrimal Blueprint Quick and Easy Meals. This just goes to 
show that although I don&rsquo;t follow a particular diet, that I do find a lot 
of good recipes in the cookbooks! Plus, the original recipe calls for a dairy 
product which I find interesting! One thing I will never be is dogmatic about 
food! I love and adore food, but it is not my religion.</p> 
<p><strong>Turkish Eggs</strong> (adapted from <em>Primal Blueprint: Quick and 
Easy Meals</em>)</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong><br>
 &frac14; cup plain full fat yogurt<br>
 
1 large garlic clove, finely chopped<br>
 1 egg<br>
 2 TBS butter<br>
 Sprinkle 
of dry thyme<br>
 &frac14; tsp hot paprika<br>
 Pinch of salt</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Stir yogurt and garlic together and spread on 
serving plate. Fry the egg in 1 TBS of butter. At the same time in a small 
saucepan or butter warmer melt the other TBS of butter and add herbs and 
spices. Turn off heat when butter starts to sizzle and brown. Place fried egg 
on yogurt and drizzle with butter mixture.</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Sardinian Purcavru in Agru Durci</h2>  February 6th, 2012 by The Leftover 
Queen <br>
Pin it <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p><em>Purcavru in Agru Durci garnished with mirto</em></p> 
<p>I told you all I was going to be making things interesting on here with 
different recipes from a variety of different world cuisines!</p> 
<p>With the first in this series, I am giving a nod to my husband&rsquo;s 
Sardinian roots. Sardinia is a small island off the coast of Italy in the 
vicinity of Rome. I was lucky enough to go there this past year when Roberto 
and I went with our moms on the &ldquo;roots tour&rdquo; of Italy. Roberto was 
born in Sardinia to Sardinian parents, but grew up in Rome. On our visit there 
last fall, we spent time with the extended family. It was lovely.</p> 
<p>Sardinia is an interesting place, I immediately loved it because it has a 
rich culture both with herding animals (sheep and goats) but is also the place 
in Europe which has the greatest amount of megalithic structures, making this 
farm girl and history buff very happy!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>These megalithic structures, round tower-fortresses called <em>nuraghi,</em>
 which ancient villages were built around are over 35,000 years old and there 
are over 8,000 of them on Sardinia, an island that is about the size and shape 
as Vermont. So that is a lot of pre-history going on there! If you aren&rsquo;t 
into history, Sardinia is home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the 
world,<em>La Costa Smeralda</em>- The Emerald Coast. There are also beautiful 
mountains (yes they get snow!) and lunar looking rock formations. There is an 
area towards the middle of the island that is called<em>Valle Della Luna</em> 
&ndash; The Valley of the Moon and looks just like Rohan from the Lord of the 
Rings movies. Fascinating landscape!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But the thing I loved about it most is that it is home to some of the 
oldest trees in Europe. We were able to visit 2 of these old olives, the oldest 
being 5,000 years old and the second oldest being around 3,000 &ndash; and 
still producing olives!!! For me, a nature worshiper it was akin to meeting 
Gandhi. The most amazing thing about Italy in general is that you can grow so 
much food! Nearly everyone that has even a small plot of land has fruit trees, 
some grapes to make homemade wine, nut and olive trees, veggie gardens, etc. I 
saw tons of pomegranate and fig trees. There is just so much abundance there!
</p> 
<p>Sardinia actually has its own language, <em>Sardu</em>, of which there are 
several dialects. Sardu has been influenced by Catalan, Spanish and indigenous 
Nuragic elements with some roots from Phoenician and Etruscan. So instead of 
the more familiar Italian &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;o&rdquo; word endings, 
Sardinian words end with &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;s&rdquo;, like our last 
name, Campus. This is because Sardinian is much like Latin. You can see this in 
the name of this dish<em>Purcavru Agru Durci</em>, which in Italian would be<em>
 Cinghiale Agrodolce</em>.</p> 
<p>So what about the food? Well because of its location, Sardinian cuisine has 
been able to capture tastes from various Mediterranean influences: Catalan, 
Corsican, Spanish, Italian. The diet is rich in meats, like lamb, goat and 
pork, fresh vegetables, wonderful cheeses, fresh veggies and of course copious 
amounts of olive oil and rich red wine, famed for its high level of 
antioxidants-<em>Cannonou</em>. On the coast, where we didn&rsquo;t spend much 
time, there is also a lot of fish and seafood consumed. And, like the rest of 
Italy the population consumes large amounts of pasta and bread. In fact as a 
gluten-intolerant, I had a hard time in Italy in general staying away from 
wheat as it is in almost everything from bread and pasta, to a thickener in 
sauces and a coating on vegetables and meats. I asked the question on facebook 
the other day after reading anarticle about how wheat is killing the world, how 
people like Italians, and especially Sardinians, known the world over as 
healthy andone of the longest living peoples could be in such a good state of 
health (the island has the world&rsquo;s highest documented percentage of 
people who have passed the century threshold.) if wheat is the only factor. It 
was an interesting discussion, but none of us were able to really make sense of 
that!</p> 
<p>But I digress. One thing which is very unique to Sardinian cuisine is the 
use of<em>Mirto</em>, or Myrtle. The plant is symbolic of love and immortality, 
and in Sardinia it is an essential plant. The berries (which look a bit like 
small blueberries, although there is a white version as well )are used to make 
a delicious aperitif, called &ldquo;mirto&rdquo;, which uses both varieties of 
berries separately, creating a red and white version and the leaves. Sardinians 
also use the leaves in cooking, similar in manner to bay leaves or other 
herbaceous plants. I was able to get some to bring home with me, and this is 
one of the ingredients that really makes this dish. The taste is very hard to 
place for me, but is most similar to a bay leaf.</p> 
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to get wild boar for this dish, but we did use meat 
from the half pig we bought this year (and butchered ourselves) from a local 
farmer.</p> 
<p>Purcavru in Agru Durci (from <em><strong>Cooking in Sardinia</strong></em>)
</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>4-5 TBS olive oil<br>
 1 onion, finely chopped<br>
 1 tsp myrtle leaves 
(substitute bay leaf)<br>
 1 &frac12; lbs boneless boar or pork meat, cut into 
bite sized pieces<br>
 1 tsp sugar<br>
 1 TBS red wine vinegar<br>
 1 TBS 
tomato Paste<br>
 Salt to taste</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Saut&eacute; onion in a pan (I used cast 
iron) with 4-5 TBS of olive oil. Add about a tsp of chopped myrtle leaves. Add 
the meat and a pinch of salt and brown over medium heat. Blend sugar and 
vinegar, stir and pour over the meat. Then dilute tomato paste in a cup of warm 
water, add to the pan, lower the heat, cover and simmer for 45 mins. You will 
have to add more water intermittently so the stew doesn&rsquo;t dry out. During 
the last five minutes, uncover pan to reduce the sauce.</p>  Tags: <br>

<h2>Sticky Toffee Pudding (Gluten-Free!)</h2>  January 30th, 2012 by The 
Leftover Queen <br>
Pin it <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of my favorite desserts of all time is Sticky Toffee Pudding. The first 
time I had it was in Galway, Ireland. But once I developed a taste for it, I 
had it every chance I could get, which considering where I live, is not very 
often, and since I had to stop eating gluten, not at all! To my good fortune, 
this has all recently changed!</p> 
<p>For those of you who have not been bewitched by this amazing treat, 
I&rsquo;ll give you a run-down of what it actually is. What it is not, is a 
pudding in the American sense of the word, but a tender, moist cake- a true 
pudding in the British sense of the word.</p> 
<p>Now everyone knows that British/ Scottish/ Irish cuisine does not get its 
due credit in the world of gastronomy. In fact it is often looked down upon. 
But there is really no need for it &ndash; if you actually have the good 
fortune to try it first hand, I guarantee you will find much to write home 
about. The foods of these small northern European islands are quite good, lots 
of fresh vegetables, wild game, wonderful sausages and unexpectedly &ndash; 
dessert. I fell in love with the desserts when I traveled to Ireland and 
Scotland-cranachan, treacle pudding, Victoria sponge, custards and of course 
the queen of them all, Sticky Toffee Pudding (that&rsquo;s why it is all in 
Caps, it is that good!).</p> 
<p>Sticky Toffee Pudding is a moist, rich cake made with dates (sometimes 
prunes) and topped with a wonderful toffee sauce. Many times puddings are 
served with a topping of thin custard, like cr&egrave;me anglaise. I have seen 
Sticky Toffee Pudding served with both together. There is some mystery to the 
origins of this special dessert, some say it was developed in the south of 
England, and others say it was being served and enjoyed in Aberdeenshire, 
Scotland many years before if became popular in England. I think we should give 
this one to the Scots. I mean the English have laid claim to much that has 
belonged to the Scots these many long years, and why quibble over a dessert?</p>
<p></p> 
<p>I digress, so for Burns Night I was looking for a festive dessert and I 
remembered Sticky Toffee Pudding. I started by searching on line for 
gluten-free recipes. I found a few, but none of them alone felt like it was 
going to yield a classic. So I forged out on my own. I must say that the one 
ingredient that makes the recipe isLyle&rsquo;s Golden Syrup - cane sugar syrup 
that has been made the same way for over 125 years (and another Scottish 
invention!) and a good substitute for evil corn syrup. Once I tasted it, I knew 
that it was this beautiful amber syrup that really lends the magical element 
that makes a classic Sticky Toffee Pudding taste.</p> 
<p>So if you are gluten-free and want to try a new delicious and simple to 
prepare dessert, or are already a lover of Sticky Toffee Pudding, you will love 
this recipe! It was a huge hit at our Burns Supper!</p> 
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong><br>
 1 cup of organic chopped dates<br>
 1 
&frac14; cup water<br>
 1TBS pure vanilla extract<br>
 2 TBS whiskey<br>
 1 cup 
gluten free flour mix<br>
 1 cup almond flour/meal<br>
 &frac14; cup arrowroot
<br> 2 tsp baking soda<br>
 Pinch of salt<br>
 &frac14; cup softened butter<br>

 &frac14; cup Greek yogurt<br>
 2 eggs<br>
 &frac14; cup Lyle&rsquo;s Golden 
Syrup<br>
 2 cups heavy cream<br>
 &frac14; cup Lyle&rsquo;s Golden syrup<br>
 
&frac14; cup coconut palm sugar</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong><br>
 Preheat oven to 325 F<br>
 Simmer chopped 
dates in water for about 10 minutes. Drain the dates and place into a food 
processor, add the vanilla and whiskey and pulse a few times, until you have a 
chunky paste.<br>
 In a separate bowl whisk dry ingredients together: GF flour 
mix, almond flour, salt, and baking soda.<br>
 In another small bowl, beat 
together the butter, yogurt and eggs. Then combine all the dry and wet 
ingredients together and add &frac14; cup of Lyle&rsquo;s while mixing.</p> 
<p>I used a muffin tin to bake my puddings, but you could use ramekins or a 
large baking dish to make a large pudding (cooking times will vary). I filled 
my muffin tin to the top with the batter &ndash; creating a large muffin sized 
pudding.<br>
 Bake for 20-25 minutes. In the meantime you can make the toffee 
sauce. Just heat the heavy cream, sugar and Lyle&rsquo;s until it boils, then 
lower heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, while stirring often.<br>
<em>*Tip: 
Since I wanted to serve my puddings warm, but make them ahead of time, I made 
them, and then baked them for 10 minutes. Then I took them out of the oven. 
When I was ready to serve dessert later that night, I popped them back in the 
oven for another 10 minutes while I made the sauce!</em><br>
 Serve warm,

<h2>Buckwheat Shortbread</h2>  January 19th, 2012 by The Leftover Queen <br>

Pin it <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I love shortbread. &nbsp;I know some are less enamored with the dry, 
crumbly texture but when using great quality butter, the key ingredient; it 
brings this Scottish specialty to a new level. &nbsp;Served with tea, its 
natural accompaniment, it is pure bliss.</p> 
<p>I think now is a good time to discuss butter, we eat a lot of it in this 
house (and have very good cholesterol reports and excellent blood pressure), 
but it is of the highest quality &ndash; grassfed, organic, artisanal butter. 
Yes, it is more expensive, but if you spend the extra money, it turns into a 
virtual health food and you can eat more of it without getting sick!</p> 
<p>I know some of you are probably shaking your heads right now in dis-belief, 
but you see, butter has gotten a bad rap over recent years because the quality 
of butter found in most grocery stores is dismal. &nbsp;A lot of you may have 
seen the news that Paula Deen, known for her butter laden foods has finally 
come forward being diagnosed with Type II diabetes, many of you are probably 
not surprised and many of you might think butter is the culprit, or even fat 
for that matter. But really, it is all about quality. Just think about our 
great-grandparents who cooked with a lot of butter and were in good health.</p> 
<p>Most &ldquo;butter&rdquo; these days has canola or other oils on the 
ingredient list, or &ldquo;natural flavoring&rdquo; (code word for MSG) &ndash; 
especially when you get into the realm of &ldquo;light&rdquo; 
&ldquo;lowfat&rdquo; or &ldquo;spreadable butter&rdquo;. &nbsp;Just look at the 
ingredient list for Land O&rsquo; Lakes &ldquo;light&rdquo; butter: I<strong>
ngredients:</strong> Butter (Cream, Salt), Water*, Buttermilk*, Contains Less 
Than 2% of Food Starch-Modified*, Tapioca Maltodextrin*, Salt, Distilled 
Monoglycerides*, Lactic Acid*, Potassium Sorbate* and Sodium Benzoate* 
(Preservatives), PGPR* (emulsifier), Natural Flavor*, Xanthan Gum*, Vitamin A 
Palmitate*, Beta Carotene* (color). &nbsp;Sorry but that isn&rsquo;t butter 
anymore, it is a chem lab.</p> 
<p>Even if your butter just contains cream and salt, it is likely from cows 
fed on grain and pumped with hormones, probably living in terrible conditions 
and that really makes all the difference in terms of your health and your 
arteries. If you eat grassfed butter, you are basically eating a nutritious, 
body boosting food, made up of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats coming from 
healthy animals eating nutritious grass.</p> 
<p>So please, use good quality, healthy butter when cooking. I recommend 
Kerrygold &ndash; which can actually be found in most grocery stores (usually 
in the gourmet cheese section, but ask your store&rsquo;s customer service for 
more info). I also like Organic Valley&rsquo;s Pasture butter (green package) 
and Vermont Butter &amp; Cheese&rsquo;s European style butter, in that order. 
In a pinch, go for Cabot &ndash; found in groceries all over the country! If 
you can&rsquo;t afford good quality butter, use less of it and substitute in 
olive oil.</p> 
<p>Now onto the shortbread- since we are celebrating all things Scottish in 
January , shortbread is a perfect addition to the subject. A traditional 
shortbread is nothing more than sugar, butter and flour- in a one to two to 
three ratio, respectively. That is it. Traditionally it was made with oat 
flour, but most modern versions are made with white flour.</p> 
<p>This time I opted for buckwheat flour. I had some delicious buckwheat 
shortbread this past summer and decided to try my hand at making my own 
version! It is virtually the same taste as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shortbread, 
although a bit nuttier &ndash; which just compliments the butter- and gives the 
shortbread a darker color.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;INGREDIENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>2 cups buckwheat flour</p> 
<p>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</p> 
<p>1/4 cup pure maple syrup (honey works also)</p> 
<p>1 stick of cold butter, cut into small pieces</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p> 
<p>Preheat oven to 300 F.&nbsp; Mix all dry ingredients together in a large 
bowl, then pour maple over top, using your hands, a pastry cutter or a fork, 
mix in the butter, a little at a time until you have a crumbly dough.</p> 
<p>Press the dough into a prepared (greased with butter) 9-inch round pan. If 
you have a shortbread pan, even better! Bake for about 40 minutes or until 
golden in color. Let cool about 10 minutes, then flip pan over onto a dish and 
remove the shortbread. Cut into wedges while still warm. Serve with tea or 
coffee!</p>  Tags: <br>
