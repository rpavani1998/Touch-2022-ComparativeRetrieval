<h2>4 Perfect Pear Recipes</h2> February 9th, 2012 
<p>Maple Magic Pears with Cheddar</p> 
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many fruits that are associated with winter, but pears 
might just be one of them. Varieties such as D&rsquo;Anjou pears are ready to 
be picked in the fall, and then take four to six weeks to ripen, and can be 
kept in cold storage for months. You can find lots of delicious pears in 
markets now, and many of them are lovely to be eaten on their own or added to 
salads.</p> 
<p>Try these four recipes for more ways to enjoy winter pears!</p> 
<p>Maple Magic Pears with Cheddar<br>
These are magical for the fact that they 
only have four ingredients. They come together quickly, and make for a lovely 
dessert.</p> 
<p>Winter Greens Salad with Pancetta, Pears and Pecans<br>
Hearty greens are 
sturdy enough to hold up well to this warm honey tarragon vinaigrette dressing. 
Feel free to switch the pears to apple, pancetta to bacon or pecans to almonds 
in this perfect cold-weather entr&eacute;e salad.</p> 
<p>Blue Cheese and Pear Salmon</p> 
<p>Blue Cheese and Pear Salmon<br>
It may sound unusual, but a little Canadian 
blue and pear make this salmon a must try.</p> 
<p>Roast Chicken and Squash with Spiced Pear Chutney<br>
There&rsquo;s nothing 
more scrumptious than the combination of sweet and savory.</p>

<h2>3 Delicious Big Bowls of Noodles</h2> February 6th, 2012 
<p>&quot;Blazing&quot; Big Rice Noodles</p> 
<p>Tasty, easy and comforting, a big bowl of noodles is sometimes exactly what 
the doctor ordered. These three recipes will hit the spot when you&rsquo;re in 
the mood for a bit of slurping.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Blazing&rdquo; Big Rice Noodles<br>
Humanity has a natural affinity 
for the comfort afforded by a warm bowl of noodles. If you can&rsquo;t find 
rice noodles, substitute your favourite pasta noodles.</p> 
<p>Broccoli Sesame Noodles<br>
Fresh and healthy, this veggie-filled dish 
unites many delicious flavours.</p> 
<p>Soba Noodles with Grilled Veggies and Sesame Ginger Dressing<br>
This cool 
vegetarian noodle dish is a perfect meal for any occasion. Since it&rsquo;s 
served at room temperature, you can prepare everything several hours ahead, 
then assemble it at the last minute.&nbsp;If weather doesn&rsquo;t permit 
grilling outside, try a grill pan on the stove.</p>

<h2>Ingredient Primer: Jicama</h2> February 1st, 2012 
<p>Richard B's Vegetarian Tacos</p> 
<p>If a radish and a lumpy potato got together and had a baby, it would look 
something like jicama. Jicama is a root vegetable, and it&rsquo;s also known as 
a Mexican yam or a Mexican turnip. Not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s very popular in 
Mexican cooking, and is also used regularly in southeast Asian cooking.</p> 
<p>Jicama boasts lots of dietary fibre, vitamins A, B and C as well as some 
calcium, and it can be eaten raw or cooked. It can be mashed like a potato, 
thrown into salads or added to stir fries. It has a very mild sweet and nutty 
flavour, and its texture isn&rsquo;t unlike that of water chestnuts.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never cooked with jicama, give it a shot with one of these 
four recipes.</p> 
<p>Richard B&rsquo;s Vegetarian Tacos<br>
These no-cook tacos are a zesty spin 
on international entertaining. Thinly-sliced jicama rounds are used in place of 
taco shells!</p> 
<p>Seared Halibut with White Summer Salad<br>
Don&rsquo;t limit 
yourself&mdash;any fish is delicious with this salad. And we know it&rsquo;s 
not summer, but the salad features jicama, fennel and white asparagus. While 
not all of these are in season (and we&rsquo;re fans of seasonal eating), they 
can be found in grocery stores right now.</p> 
<p>Orange and Avocado Salsa</p> 
<p>Orange and Avocado Salsa<br>
Serve this refreshing salsa with lightly 
grilled flatbread.</p> 
<p>Quick Fish Tacos with Lime Sour Cream<br>
Fresh and flavourful, this quick 
meal is nutritious and fun for the whole family. Ingredients can be set out on 
the table allowing everyone a chance to assemble tacos to their personal taste. 
Other terrific taco toppers would be diced avocado, jicama or radish slices or 
chopped green onion.</p>

<h2>4 Healthier Super Bowl Snacks</h2> January 30th, 2012 
<p>Crispy Quinoa, Lime and Chipotle-Crusted Chicken Strips</p> 
<p>After the major holidays, Super Bowl Sunday might just be one of the 
greatest food events of the year. Even if you&rsquo;re not a football fan, the 
food alone is enough to get anyone excited about the game.</p> 
<p>But, like most of our major holidays, the food served isn&rsquo;t exactly 
health-check approved. Chicken wings, nachos with cheese sauce, pizza, 
beer&hellip; it&rsquo;s not exactly a healthfest. But you can lighten up some 
Super Bowl favourites with these delicious options. Not all of these are lower 
in fat, but they all deliver more health per serving, whether it be whole wheat 
ingredients,&nbsp;more protein, more healthy fats or less sodium than their 
store-bought cousins. Game on!</p> 
<p>Crispy Quinoa, Lime and Chipotle-Crusted Chicken Fingers<br>
Think outside 
the usual quinoa salad box and this fabulous ancient grain can offer endless 
recipe possibilities. Keep cooked quinoa available in the fridge for extra 
quick meal prep. Crunchy carrots sticks make a delightful accompaniment.</p> 
<p>Whole Wheat Nachos with Corn<br>
This spin on nachos still packs a cheesy 
punch, but whole wheat is a healthier base than traditional nacho chips.</p> 
<p>Avocado Mango Salsa</p> 
<p>Homemade Whole Wheat and Beer Pizza<br>
This pizza has been known to 
disappear off plates in seconds. Be creative with your toppings and use 
what&rsquo;s in your fridge.</p> 
<p>Avocado Mango Salsa<br>
The mango adds a sweet and lively twist to this 
spicy salsa. Delicious with chicken or fish, or on its own with soft corn 
tortillas.&nbsp;Plus, when you make it at home, you get to control how much 
sodium goes in.</p>
