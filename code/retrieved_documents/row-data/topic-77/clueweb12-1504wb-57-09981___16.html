<h3> Coconut Oil: Oil From the Tree of Life </h3> <br>

<p></p> Introduction <br>
<br>
The coconut palm tree is a remarkable and 
valuable plant. The coconut palm tree has probably a thousand uses. The nut of 
the coconut palm plant is used as a source of food to sustain life. It is an 
important ingredient in medicine. Other parts of the plant are used as 
materials to build shelter, make clothing, charcoal, and various tools. The 
purpose of the plant is numerous. The coconut palm tree has the scientific 
name: Cocos nucifera, but it has other well meaning names that seem to suit it 
just as well. In India it is referred to as &quot;Kalpa vriksha&quot; or the 
&quot;tree which provides all the necessities of life&quot;. In the Philippines 
it is called the &quot;tree of life&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
The coconut palm grows 
abundantly in the tropics and it gives the islands the feeling of paradise and 
romance, especially along its coastlines. It typically grows to 60 to 70 feet 
tall and has a life span of up to 70 years. The fruit of the coconut tree is 
considered botanically a seed, but in the tropics it is mostly considered a 
nut. It bears year round in bunches of 5 to 12 nuts every month.<br>
<br>
The 
coconut palm takes 14 months to fully mature. A young coconut is completely 
filled with liquid (referred to as coconut water) and has little meat. The meat 
is soft and jelly-like in texture and can be eaten with a spoon. A fully mature 
coconut has less liquid and more meat. Its meat is thick and hard and less 
sweet than the meat of the young coconut.<br>
<br>
The content of meat and 
liquid varies as the nut matures. Fresh mature coconut meat is also used to 
make makecoconut milk, but fresh coconut meat can spoil quickly and so it is 
often dried to last for many weeks and longer if sealed in an airtight 
container and kept cool. However, it is the meat of the coconut that is used to 
make coconut oil that has captured the most controversy within the last two 
decades and encourage a number of nutritional fallacies.<br>
<br>
The 
controversy behind coconut oil <br>
<br>
Coconut oil has been around for 
thousand of years. Evidence of its early use is seen in Ayurveda literature. In 
India, the oil was used in food, lotion, pomades, baths, and medicines. It was 
also used in Asia, The Pacific islands, Africa, and Central America. Coconut 
oil was introduced to the Europeans as far back in the 15th century.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
By the 1800's, coconut oil was a main form of trade for many of these 
islands and countries that had an abundance of the coconut palms. It was not 
only an edible oil; it was used to make soap, candles, lamps, pomades, and many 
cosmetics. In order to produce a quart of coconut oil, 10 coconuts were needed. 
An increased demand in coconut would obviously mean higher prices. The leading 
country producers of coconut oil were Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
India. It was also produced in Latin America and South America. These are the 
producers that were mostly affected by the biggest propaganda ever hatched in 
the field of nutrition.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the 1970s, studies indicated that 
saturated fat increase blood cholesterol which could increase the risk factor 
in the development of heart disease. In the USA, coconut oil was already used 
in a number of baking products. Even in a number of old American recipe books, 
coconut oil was included. But soon a number of consumer groups and special 
interest organization began to lobby the removal of coconut oil from most of 
its foods.<br>
<br>
<br>
Consequently, coconut oil, because of its high content 
of saturated fat and its new stigma as an &quot;artery-clogging fat&quot;, 
became an undesirable and an &quot;unhealthy&quot; choice in cooking. This 
perpetuated a perfect environment for other types of oil producers to take 
advantage of this growing consumer fear. And that is just what they did to push 
their cheaper hydrogenated oils.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the 1980's, more effort was 
place to encourage the use of soybean oils. The anti-tropical oil smear 
campaign promoters were very vocal and were soon successful in decreasing the 
overall consumption of the tropical oil, including coconut oil, in the American 
diet to about 2%. Food manufacturers even went as far as stating in their 
labels that their products &quot;contains no tropical oil&quot;.<br>
<br>
The 
scientific and political propaganda was successful in getting the interest of 
the public to replace tropical oils with cheaper polyunsaturated soybean oil 
from American farmers. The general public and commercial food industry 
supported the idea that polyunsaturated vegetable oil, such as soybean, 
safflower, and corn oils, were good in reducing total cholesterol, better than 
coconut oil. (One important fact to note is that this method of reducing total 
cholesterol was not sufficient to determine a healthy cholesterol. A person 
with a total cholesterol reading of 200 mg/dl could still have heart problems. 
The best way to measure cholesterol is by the use of the cholesterol ratio that 
takes into account the amount of HDL and LDL. A cholesterol ratio of 5.0 is 
normal, and above this value indicates an increasing risk of heart disease). By 
the 1990's, competition in the edible oil market was practically eliminated. 
Tropical oil exporters from Malaysia and the Philippines responded to what they 
termed as &quot;vicious scare tactics&quot; used against their products.<br>

<br> <br>
An early food pyramid that reflects the support of polyunsaturated 
oils. <br>
No mention of coconut oil as a source of fat. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The fallacies are exposed <br>
<br>
The coconut oil manufacturers stood up to 
dispute the common misconceptions promoted throughout the years. They sought to 
clarify that coconut oil contains absolutely no cholesterol because it is 
derived from a plant and that it could not raise blood cholesterol or 
contribute to heart disease. Also, the saturated fat in coconut oil 
(Medium-chain fatty acid or MCFA) is different from the saturated fat in meat. 
They explained that the MCFA in coconut oil is heart friendly, helps protect 
against heart disease, and does not have a harmful effect on cholesterol 
levels. Their claim propelled a number of studies to find support for this 
information.<br>
<br>
<br>
A number of interesting facts came out of these 
studies as they observed the use of coconut oil in some populations that had a 
high consumption of coconut oil. In these populations, such as the populations 
of the Polynesian islands, showed the lowest level of cholesterol and low 
levels of mortality from heart disease, despite the fact that the consumption 
of coconut oil was quite high. The coconut oil was part of the staple diets of 
all Polynesian, Melanesian, and Asian peoples. They had much better health than 
those in north America and Europe who didn't use coconut oil. These people were 
relatively free from the the degenerative disease that plagued those under the 
American or western diet.<br>
<br>
However, when these people substituted their 
traditional diet and adopted the western diet they found an increase in many 
diseases that was almost unheard of, such as gout, diabetes, obesity, 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and arthritis. Other studies showed that 
these alternative vegetable oils increased the fat content of foods fried in 
it. The food therefore absorbed more fat and could cause an increase fat 
consumption, and worse its hydrogenated fat had a negative effect on blood 
cholesterol.<br>
<br>
It would seem that replacing coconut oil (even palm oil) 
with hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as soybeans, is only beneficial to these 
edible oil industries and not its consumers. Unfortunately, coconut oil still 
continues to get a lot of criticism from alternative vegetable oil supporters 
despite the fact that these hydrogenated oils are not easily digested and is 
composed of toxic trans fatty acids. Today, almost all the foods we buy in the 
supermarket contains alternative hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br>
<br>
<br>
So 
the health benefits of coconut oil remains unheard of in many areas of western 
society still. Fortunately, coconut oil is still used in many countries and its 
benefits are being revealed. In India, Panama, and even Jamaica, the coconut is 
seen as a health tonic for the heart and is consumed like a normal liquid 
supplement. In these countries the coconut oil is known for its health-giving 
properties and therapeutic benefits.<br>
<br>
The properties and benefits of 
coconut oil <br>
<br>
Coconut oil is a stable oil with a chemical composition 
of 92% saturated fat, 6% monounsaturated fat, and 2% polyunsaturated fat. The 
medium-chain fatty acid or medium-chain triglycerides in coconut oil makes it a 
healthier choice than fat that contains mostly long-chain fatty acids. This is 
because the MCFA is easily absorbed directly into the blood, and carried to the 
liver or converted to immediate energy.<br>
<br>
Its fat is not stored like 
long-chain fatty acids which are converted into triglycerides in the intestine. 
Therefore, the MCFA from the coconut oil is easily metabolized and poses no 
risk to clogging the arteries, because it does not require lipoproteins or 
special enzymes to utilize the fat by the body. The fatty acid composition of 
coconut oil is mostly capric acid, caprylic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, 
palmitic acid, myristic acid, linoleic acid, and mainly lauric acid.<br>
<br>

Lauric acid is a unique fat that is also found only in mother's milk. The fatty 
acids found in coconut oil has no harmful effects and can promote better health 
because it has antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Coconut oil 
is stable and has a long shelf life; it could last up to three years. Also, at 
temperatures lower than 24.5 degrees C, it can convert to a white solid form. 
Therefore, coconut oil can stay fresher longer than any other polyunsaturated 
oils.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the benefits of cooking with coconut oil: 
it can treat digestive or mal absorption problems; it can be used in commercial 
infant formulas; it reduces fat consumption and stimulates metabolism which can 
lead to weight loss; it helps regulate thyroid function, balance blood sugar 
level, increase energy, and promote overall heath. Therefore, coconut oil can 
help lower LDL cholesterol and prevent high cholesterol, arthritis, 
fibromyalgia, candida, herpes, allergies, psoriasis, influenza, diabetes, etc. 
It is an antibiotic, an immuno-enhancer and an immunoregulator.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
The quality of the copra in a coconut used to make coconut oil 
varies. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between (unrefined) virgin 
coconut oil (VCO) from the refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) coconut oil 
if you are interested in using it as an edible oil. VCO is the pure, 
unadulterated, form of the coconut oil. It is the healthiest form of coconut 
oil because it is made with the least possible processing from fresh coconut 
meat and with absolutely no chemicals. VCO is colourless, it has a mild coconut 
aroma, and a mild pleasant flavor. It retains most of the phytonutrients and 
chemical properties already mentioned. RBD coconut oil lacks most or all of 
these phytonutrients and is therefore of a lower quality than VCO.<br>
<br>
<br>
The RBD coconut oil is a hydrogenated coconut oil. They are made from older 
coconuts (damaged or undamaged). The dried copra is generally exposed to the 
sun before processing and gather an appreciable amount of bacteria and mold. It 
is refined and sterilized to remove much of the contaminants. Sometimes 
chemicals are used to extract the greatest amount of oil from the copra. As a 
result, much of the needed phytonutrients are removed. A less refined or lower 
grade RBD oil may have a slight yellow color because of the unremoved traces of 
contaminants. RBD coconut oil may have a mild musty or chemical taste. Poor 
quality oil or rancid coconut oil can irritate the throat.<br>
<br>
Conclusion 
<br> <br>
The health benefits derived from coconut oil, particularly VCO, is 
remarkable and is certainly a necessary tree of life. The evidence is before 
us. We have part of the reason for the increasing epidemic of obesity, heart 
problems and diabetes that is short changing the longevity of many people in 
the west. Perhaps, it is time for society to start going back to basics if they 
wish to see a drastic improvement in the overall health of all populations.<br>

<p> A well written and enjoyable read for anyone interested in dietary effects 
or cooking with coconut oil. I used VCO several years ago, but stopped and have 
gradually gained back weight I previously lost. It also helped to alleviate my 
dry skin problems, which are back again. Thanks for the encouragement to 
incorporate it in our diet once again.</p> </dd>
