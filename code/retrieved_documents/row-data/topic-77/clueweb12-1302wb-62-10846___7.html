<br>love the cook put into it when preparing the dish.&quot; - Paula Wolfert<br>

Client Speak
<br><br>
I'm glad I found this!<br>
I've been looking for a clay rice cooker 
for a long time. And I'm very happy I finally found and bought it here. It 
combined the traditional and modern cooking with the smart technology. I use it 
everyday to make rice, stew and soup for my family. It's really simple and 
healthy!!!<br>

Tip Of The Month
<br><br>
Please always be sensitive that any cooking in the VitaClay&reg; 
Cooker is &quot;wet&quot;. Nothing should be cooked dry in the cooker, because 
it can cause the clay pot to crack. Never bake, brown, toast or fry any food in 
the VitaClay&reg; cooker.<br>
