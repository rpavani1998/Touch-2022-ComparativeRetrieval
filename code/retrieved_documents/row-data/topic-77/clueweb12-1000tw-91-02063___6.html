<h1>York County school meals are healthier, but not enough, nutritionists say
</h1> By Shawn Cetrone - scetrone@heraldonline.com <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Schools across York County offer salad bars and whole grain bread at lunch. 
Dietitians lead nutrition lessons urging children to make &ldquo;healthy 
choices.&rdquo; Some schools even let students take a second trip through the 
lunch line for extra helpings of fruits and veggies.</p> 
<p>Such efforts are promising, but nutrition advocates say menus dominated by 
processed, fast food fare undermine those noble attempts and leave school meals 
a long way from healthy.</p> 
<p>New federal rules, which start taking effect this year, are meant to 
improve school food in the long run. They require schools to double the amount 
of fruits and vegetables served, increase whole grains, serve only low fat or 
fat-free milk and limit trans fats. By 2022, schools must cut the amount of 
sodium served in half.</p> &laquo; Prev 1 of 3 photos Next &raquo; <br>

Here&rsquo;s a look at how much meals cost in York County&rsquo;s four school 
districts.Breakfast Rock Hill: $1 Fort Mill: $1.05 Clover: $1 York: 75 cents 
Lunch Rock Hill: Elementary, $2; Middle and high, $2.25-$2.50 Fort Mill: 
Elementary, $1.65; Middle and high, $1.90-$2.50 Clover: Elementary, $1.90; 
Middle and high, $2.15-$2.90 York: Elementary,$1.75; Middle and high, $1.85<br>

</li> </ul> <br>

<p> Most York County schools are well on the way to meeting some of those 
rules, food service directors said. They serve fewer fried foods and offer more 
fruits and vegetables. Pizza crusts and burger buns are whole grain. Cheese and 
milk are low fat. Corn dogs are actually turkey dogs with &ldquo;whole grain 
breading.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Still many meals include processed, pre-packaged products resembling 
what&rsquo;s typically served at drive-through windows &ndash; precisely the 
type of food health advocates urge children to steer clear of.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Continuing to model a fast food menu at school helps create 
preference for fast food,&rdquo; said Sonya Jones, deputy director of the 
University of South Carolina&rsquo;s Center for Research in Nutrition and 
Health Disparities. And &ldquo;processed meat in any form is not healthy.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Processed foods considered unhealthy generally contain preservatives and 
excess sodium and saturated fat.</p> 
<p>Multiple studies have linked processed meat consumption to chronic 
illnesses like diabetes, obesity, heart disease and cancer.</p> 
<p>A 2010 study by the Harvard School of Public Health concluded that eating 
processed meats such as bacon, salami, sausages, hot dogs and deli meats can 
raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease.</p> 
<p>The findings suggest the high amounts of &ldquo;salt and preservatives ... 
might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed 
meats,&rdquo; researchers concluded.</p> 
<p>Food service directors said they understand the concerns, but are hampered 
by tight budgets and picky palates.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to serve nutritional food, but you&rsquo;re also 
trying to run a business,&rdquo; said Chad Mitchell, food service director for 
Rock Hill schools. &ldquo;If you go across the country, half to 75 percent of 
our menus are the same products. We all have chicken nuggets, chicken 
sandwiches, burgers and pizza.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Attempts to offer healthier options frequently flop, food directors said.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The problem is you can make them as healthy as you want, and you 
feed the trash,&rdquo; Mitchell said.</p> 
<p>Some turn to what they assume children prefer.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We try to look at what the fast food companies serve and do it in a 
healthier way,&rdquo; said Sandra Brackett, food service director for the York 
school district.</p> 
<p>Fort Mill schools have gone the farthest in pushing healthier meals.</p> 
<p>Food service director Roland Cabading has added a variety of salads and cut 
back on snacks and drinks served &ldquo;a la carte.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Cabading&rsquo;s menus boast squash casserole, veggie lasagna and whole 
grain pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese.</p> 
<p>Kitchen staff bake meat loaf and bone-in chicken from scratch.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the best interests of the students,&rdquo; Cabading 
said. &ldquo;I would like to think I&rsquo;m helping the education 
process.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s been an uphill battle.</p> 
<p>The share of Fort Mill students eating lunch in the last two years has 
dropped from 55 percent to 49 percent.</p> 
<p>Trays of stuffed shells and veggie wraps go uneaten. On days when baked 
chicken and meat loaf are served, students leave notes in comment boxes 
requesting chicken nuggets instead.</p> 
<p>Facing an &lsquo;epidemic&rsquo;</p> 
<p>In a nation where about a third of adults and 17 percent of children are 
obese, South Carolina is among the heaviest.</p> 
<p>As of 2010, according to the Center for Disease Control, 31.5 percent of 
South Carolinians were obese.</p> 
<p>The CDC calls it an &ldquo;epidemic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Eat Smart, Move More York County, a group advocating healthy lifestyles, 
recently analyzed weight and height measurements for 75 percent of Rock Hill 
schools&rsquo; third- and fourth-graders.</p> 
<p>The results, Eat Smart Director David Keely said, are 
&ldquo;astounding.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>About a quarter of the students are obese. Another 17 percent of children 
in both grades are overweight.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That means 41 percent, or more than two out of every five children 
participating in the survey, are either overweight or obese,&rdquo; Keely said.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Now that we know where we are, it&rsquo;s time to get parents and 
the community to take some reasonable and affordable steps to provide children 
with as healthy meals as we can,&rdquo; said Keely, a Rock Hill physician.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Some of the changes that might come about are going to require 
parents voicing their concerns and requests. When there&rsquo;s enough of a 
voice, that should hopefully be heard by the school board.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Eat Smart, Move More is working with other school districts to gauge 
obesity rates among students.</p> 
<p>Federal officials say schools can play a crucial role in reshaping the 
nation&rsquo;s health.</p> 
<p>American obesity was a driving force behind the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture&rsquo;s new rules for school meals, USDA Spokeswoman Jean Daniel 
said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Children learn their eating and exercising habits early in 
life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We really view school meals as an opportunity to 
reinforce healthy eating habits.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We have encouraged schools to move away from processed food.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>While that&rsquo;s yet to happen, the new rules require schools to 
significantly curb the amount of sodium and eliminate trans fats within 10 
years.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s intended to push food companies to improve their products, 
Daniel said.</p> 
<p>The system</p> 
<p>School food service is a business in which success is measured mainly by 
how many students eat and what they avoid or toss in the trash.</p> 
<p>Most districts have their own food department intended to run as a 
non-profit, self-sustaining business. Some districts &ndash; including Clover 
and York &ndash; outsource meal operations to private companies.</p> 
<p>Through the National School Lunch Program, the USDA reimburses 
participating districts for each meal: $2.77 for low-income students receiving 
free lunch; $2.37 for students paying reduced price; and 26 cents for students 
paying full price.</p> 
<p>Rock Hill schools food service had expenses of $6.87 million last school 
year, according to district figures.</p> 
<p>Local food directors design menus and order food vendors and a list of 180 
USDA commodities.</p> 
<p>Directors said they want to offer healthier entrees, but are operating 
within the system they&rsquo;re given.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t have the staff&rdquo; to pound fresh beef into 
patties, said Brackett in York. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got 4,000 students that are 
going to eat that hamburger.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Still, directors said they&rsquo;re offering more fruits and vegetables 
than ever.</p> 
<p>When possible, the food&rsquo;s fresh.</p> 
<p>Rock Hill schools have served asparagus, kiwi and blood oranges while in 
season.</p> 
<p>But canned vegetables are common. With an entree of &ldquo;beef 
dippers&rdquo; &ndash; small processed beef patties the same shape as chicken 
nuggets &ndash; elementary students in February got a side of canned green 
beans, canned pears and boxed mashed potatoes reconstituted with hot water.</p> 
<p>The potato flakes were processed with preservatives. According to the 
package&rsquo;s nutrition information, a serving contains more than 20 percent 
of the recommended daily intake of sodium for children. With the other items on 
the plate, students got more than 65 percent of the daily sodium recommendation.
</p> 
<p>Students have mixed feelings about lunch.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I like to get the chicken sandwich,&rdquo; said Rileigh Glasgow, a 
South Pointe High sophomore. &ldquo;It's like a Chick-fil-a sandwich, but 
school. The okra is good.&rdquo; But &ldquo;I will never eat the wraps or corn 
dogs. The wrap tastes like dried, gross meat.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>South Pointe senior Catherine Allen sticks to subs, salads and chicken 
sandwiches.</p> 
<p>Asked why she doesn&rsquo;t eat anything else, Allen said: &ldquo;I feel 
like it's not real meat. I wish they had more fresh ingredients.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Hope and collards</p> 
<p>Even though shifting tastes has proven tougher than he hoped, Fort 
Mill&rsquo;s Cabading is standing fast &ndash; even if that means relying on 
reserves to make up for lost revenue.</p> 
<p>With the school board&rsquo;s blessing, he plans to continue limiting the 
appearance of pizza and burgers on elementary menus. He wants to introduce new 
vegetables and cook more entrees &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Gold Hill Elementary this week is testing a new web application that 
crunches nutrition values for lunch offerings and pinpoints the healthiest 
combination. Students loading up trays with those items get to ring a bell for 
recognition.</p> 
<p>Cabading said he&rsquo;s encouraged by small victories.</p> 
<p>Collard greens, for instance, were new to the menu this year and went 
uneaten for months. But students are starting to chow down.</p> 
<p>Cabading thinks it could take students their elementary career before 
they&rsquo;re accustomed to a healthier menu.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The kids here 
like their processed chicken.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He&rsquo;s right to hang in there, said Jones, a USC nutrition expert.</p> 
<p>Research shows that children typically must taste something six to 10 times 
before they&rsquo;re comfortable with it, Jones said.</p> 
<p>To make that happen, she urges educators to get creative.</p> 
<p>Have a celebrity chef drop by for demonstrations and lessons, she 
suggested. Or have children plant an edible garden and then harvest the fruits 
and veggies.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Children need the opportunity to learn to like a wide variety of 
foods,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;If we fill them up on chicken nuggets, they 
don&rsquo;t have opportunities to taste other foods.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A trip through an elementary lunch line is a reminder of how tough it can 
be to take on tweaking tastes.</p> 
<p>Dozens of Belleview Elementary students in Rock Hill scuttled through the 
lunch line one February afternoon, most passing on the new turkey pot pie with 
peas and carrots for the cheeseburger and fries.</p> 
<p>Those are among the biggest sellers, server Carol Hinson said, along with 
hot wings and pizza.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they like,&rdquo; Hinson said. &ldquo;We love our 
cheeseburgers and hot dogs and things like that. This is America.&rdquo;</p>
