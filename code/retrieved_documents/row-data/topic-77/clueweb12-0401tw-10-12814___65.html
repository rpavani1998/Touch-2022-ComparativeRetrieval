<p> Milk has been through a lot in the past 100 years. First it was subjected 
to pasteurization, then homogenization, then oxidation. Will the -ations ever 
end?</p> 
<p>The question for us milk drinkers is of course: when does a change cause a 
nutritional problem?</p> 
<p>Some say that pasteurization already kills too many healthy enzymes; see 
more on thedifferent kinds of milk pasteurization in yesterday&rsquo;s post.</p>
<h5>Is Homogenized Milk Dangerous?</h5> 
<p>I joined the crowd warning of the health dangers of homogenized milk when I 
talkeddairy fats in the fall. This post is an important update to that one!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a theory out there, propagated by Kurt Oster, that says that 
the process of breaking the fat globules into such small pieces that they 
remain suspended in the milk, homogenization, is<strong>a leading cause of 
arteriosclerosis and heart disease</strong>. I&rsquo;ve even seen it listed as 
one of the<em>top three</em> causes of heart disease, along with trans fats and 
chlorinated water.1</p> 
<p>However, even Mary Enig, co-author of Nourishing Traditions and author of 
Eat Fat, Lose Fat disagrees with Oster&rsquo;s findings. She says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In essence, Oster&rsquo;s theory replaces cholesterol as the cause of heart 
disease with another mechanism, summarized as follows:</p> 
<p>Homogenization causes a supposedly &ldquo;noxious&rdquo; enzyme called 
xanthine oxidase to be encapsulated in a liposome that can be absorbed intact.
</p> 
<p>XO is released by enzymatic action and ends up in heart and arterial tissue 
where it causes the destruction of a specialized protective membrane lipid 
called plasmalogen, causing lesions in the arteries and resulting in the 
development of plaque.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Translation: the fats damaged by homogenization can be passed through the 
walls of the digestive system directly into the circulatory system, where they 
&ldquo;scratch&rdquo; the artery walls, making a problem area to which 
cholesterol flocks (cholesterol is like the ambulance or mechanic in your 
circulatory system, repairing issues in the arteries).<strong>This forms plaque 
and causes heart disease, and it&rsquo;s all because the fat globules got too 
small.</strong></p> 
<p>But.</p> 
<p>He was wrong.</p> 
<p>Mary Enig says so here, and I also spoke with a professor in the department 
of Food Science &amp; Human Nutrition and Department of Animal Science at my 
favorite agricultural college, Michigan State University. Dr. John Partridge is 
a Dairy Food Extension Specialist, and he had this to say about concerns about 
oxidation of homogenized milk:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Homogenization is done by forcing milk through a small geometry valve at 
very high pressures (1500-2500 psi).&nbsp; The effect of this treatment is to 
break the natural fat globule (average size ~10 micrometers) into&nbsp; much 
smaller fat globules (average size &lt;2 micrometers).&nbsp; In doing this the 
fat globule membrane is broken and the surface area of the new fat globules is 
much larger than the native globules.</p> 
<p>Within the first 10-20 seconds after homogenization, proteins and segments 
of the original membrane form a new membrane on the surface of the smaller fat 
globules.&nbsp; The addition of the protein to the surface of the fat globules 
and the reduction in the size of the globules results in the reduction in the 
ability of the globules to float to the top of the milk.&nbsp; During this 
process, the milkfat is not exposed to air as the process is done in an air 
tight system containing only milk.&nbsp; Milkfat is made up of 98% 
triglycerides, which are extremely stable to changes during processing.&nbsp; 
The only way that milk will spoil faster after homogenization is if the 
homogenizing system is not properly cleaned and sanitized.</p> 
<p>Another factor that may be thrown out is the xanthine oxidase.&nbsp; Dr. K. 
Oster proposed a theory in 1971 that xanthine oxidase released from the milk 
fat globule membrane during homogenization was a contributor to 
atherosclerosis.&nbsp; To this end, I would have you read thefollowing review 
article.</p> 
<p>There is not much if any support for this theory but a lot of people are 
still using it to scare customers into paying higher prices for cream-line milk.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Dr. Partridge drinks homogenized store milk himself, although he said he 
has to take the jugs from the back to avoid the &ldquo;light oxidized flavor 
that is prevalent in milk stored under direct fluorescent lighting.&rdquo; This 
is not a man who drinks milk without consciousness.</p> 
<p>Dr. Mary Enig finishes with this, although I&rsquo;d like to see more 
foundation for her claims:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The fact that Oster&rsquo;s theory has been disproven does not mean that 
the homogenization process is benign. During homogenization there is a 
tremendous increase in surface area on the fat globules. The original fat 
globule membrane is lost and a new one is formed that incorporates a much 
greater portion of casein and whey proteins. This may account for the increased 
allergenicity of modern processed milk.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>With all that under my belt, <strong>I&rsquo;m much less afraid of 
homogenized milk than I used to be</strong>. I have some distrust in it, 
because it is quite a man-made process, so when I can stick to the natural, I 
will. I won&rsquo;t, however, pay double price for unhomogenized milk unless 
there are other upgraded benefits from the store milk! (See thismilk 
descriptions post for what all the terms on the jugs mean.)</p> 
<h5>Does Skim Milk Contain Powdered Dry Milk?</h5> 
<p>The Weston A. Price Foundation says, &ldquo;<strong>All reduced-fat milks 
have dried skim milk added to give them body</strong>, although this ingredient 
is not usually on the labels.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve seen this claim in multiple 
other places as well, but it&rsquo;s incredibly outdated and plain wrong.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m the type of person who calls companies to ask questions (in case 
you haven&rsquo;t already noticed that). When I realized that the claim of 
&ldquo;industry standard&rdquo; might be incorrect, I decided to call a few 
brands that sell milk to see what I could find out.</p> 
<p>From Meijer:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I had not heard of that being an industry standard, and I can tell you that 
<strong>none of Meijer&rsquo;s dairy suppliers add anything to the milk.
</strong></p> </blockquote> 
<p>From Bareman&rsquo;s, a local Michigan dairy:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Non-fat dried milk (skim milk powder)&nbsp; is not currently added to our, 
or any of our direct competitors lowfat or fat free milks (skim milk) and,
<strong>any direct addition of a dried milk powder would require it to be 
included on the label to meet current United States labeling requirements.
</strong> In the 1950&prime;s and 60&prime;s many states required nonfat dried 
milk to be added to lowfat (&lt;1% butterfat) and fat free milks (skim) under 
the guise of making it a nutritionally superior product to the unfortified 
product but, in reality its real purpose was to help support a higher demand 
for non-fat milk powder and ultimately a higher total milk price for the 
producer.&nbsp; Eventually, pressure from industry, regulators and 
nutritionists prevailed and all states who had &ldquo;solids 
fortification&rdquo; requirements in their dairy laws repealed them.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I would like to see the WAPF update their position on this issue, as their 
information clearly was correct decades ago but is sorely outdated.</p> 
<h5>Does Powdered Dry Milk Contain Oxidized Cholesterol?</h5> 
<p>The reason for the scare about powdered milk being added to skim and lowfat 
milk isthis:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A note on the production of skim milk powder: liquid milk is forced through 
a tiny hole at high pressure, and then blown out into the air. This causes a 
lot of nitrates to form and the cholesterol in the milk is 
oxidized&hellip;&nbsp; Oxidized cholesterol contributes to the buildup of 
plaque in the arteries, to atherosclerosis. So when you drink reduced-fat milk 
thinking that it will help you avoid heart disease, you are actually consuming 
oxidized cholesterol, which initiates the process of heart disease.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the hole in that argument: <strong>nonfat dry milk has little 
to no cholesterol</strong>to begin with, so consuming any 
&ldquo;oxidized&rdquo; cholesterol that may or may not be present there is 
probably no more hazardous to your health than eating an apple that is starting 
to brown (that process is oxidation, too).</p> 
<p>Here is a a conversation with an animal science trained former farm gal on 
oxidized cholesterol with her convincing arguments.</p> 
<p>I had been making my yogurt with store whole milk since coming around to 
the idea offull fat dairy. Once I decided there was no inherent problem 
drinking skim milk, other than the fact that it&rsquo;s missing the fat, I 
began making myyogurt with skim milk and added cream from our grassfed raw 
milk. I figured that even if homogenization isn&rsquo;t as bad as it&rsquo;s 
being made out to be, I can still get the fat to be organic, which helps my 
family avoid most of the potential toxins and hormones, which tend to collect 
in the fat.</p> 
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll tell you a bit about how I came to the decision to 
drink raw milk.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t trust the scientists, even if I was one  .</p> 
<p>The problem is that maybe we&rsquo;re asking the wrong questions. We are 
still talking in terms of nutritionism and scientific theory instead of common 
sense and what God created for us to eat.</p> 
<p>God created milk that came from animals. It is raw, unhomogenized, and 
untouched by man.</p> 
<p>Why does homogenization exist? Convenience. People like that they 
don&rsquo;t have to shake a jug of milk (really? that lazy?).</p> 
<p>Homogenization is a man made, for profit invention. </p> 
<p>And powdered milk? That&rsquo;s beyond messed up. Again &ndash; shelf life 
and money based. It&rsquo;s cheap because it&rsquo;s fake.</p> 
<p>The question should not be &ldquo;what is the science behind it?&rdquo; the 
question should be &ldquo;what did God create for our bodies and how do we 
avoid the junk that sinful man thinks he can do better on?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And is it really responsible to support these products given the farming 
practices behind them? I understand a budget, believe me, but I think 
it&rsquo;s wiser to cut dairy all together than to add this junk that was not 
designed for our bodies.</p> 
<p>Sorry for the rant <br>

<p>I agree. The first step should be identifying what God intended for us to 
eat. Just as God did not intend for cows to eat corn, I don&rsquo;t believe He 
intended for milk to necessitate heat treatment nor &ldquo;scientific 
shaking&rdquo; before it is to be consumed. (I don&rsquo;t heat my breast, nor 
pasteurize my expressed milk before feeding my daughter either) The next step 
is to figure out why the change came about in the first place and if it is 
truly necessary. Pasteurization came about to solve the sanitation issues in 
milk production. If cows are fed anything other than grass and care is not 
taken to maintain a sanitary processing, then that milk should be pasteurized. 
If the reverse is the case (grass-fed, clean processing), pasteurization is not 
&ldquo;needed&rdquo;. Homogenization is not &ldquo;needed&rdquo; period. We are 
all capable of shaking our own bottles of milk. )</p>

 Got that right! Visitors to our house think it&rsquo;s really 
weird that we shake our milk, but it makes me happy. I love the comparison with 
human breastmilk and pasteurization. Katie</p>

 Did it sound as though I was promoting skim or homogenized 
milk? I&rsquo;m not a huge fan, really, but I do want people to have less fear 
of supermarket milk IF it&rsquo;s not warranted. As you&rsquo;ll see this week, 
we choose raw milk from the farm, but I do need to supplement sometimes. 
Everyone does the best they can with the resources they have been given, and I 
think it&rsquo;s dangerous to expect perfection in anything, especially where 
and how people buy their food.</p> 
<p>Even raw milk wasn&rsquo;t *really* designed for our bodies, but rather for 
baby calves. It&rsquo;s something that can nourish us, however, as can store 
milk.</p> 
<p>Thanks for the reminder that what God created, IS GOOD.  Katie</p>

<p>Hi Katie,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that you were &ldquo;promoting&rdquo; these products, 
but rather giving us the means to justify them. I think that&rsquo;s the 
problem with human beings&hellip; give us an excuse (budget, availability, 
etc.) and we can justify anything.</p> 
<p>And then it is a slippery slope. The fact is if we can&rsquo;t get real 
milk then maybe we should look somewhere else for similar nutrients. By 
purchasing those products you are basically voting for that form of agriculture 
and food production.</p> 
<p>On the other hand I think it&rsquo;s interesting that you bring up whether 
we were even designed to drink milk. Many people say no&hellip; milk is only 
for calves. But the Bible often mentions drinking milk, although possibly in 
reference to goat or sheep&rsquo;s milk.</p> 
<p>I really do appreciate the info and your site. But the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 
not as bad as so and so says&rdquo; mentality is like a gateway drug and allows 
a nation completely dependent on food with no sustainability to justify their 
usage of it.</p> 
<p>Honestly if we&rsquo;re trying to be proper stewards then we would make an 
effort to choose foods that are sustainable and properly raised. Even if it 
means giving up milk all together.</p>

 I grew up on a small family dairy farm. We grazed our cows 
&amp; we fed them grain too because they needed the energy it provided to keep 
from getting too skinny. they were already bony because they were reasonably 
producing cows. after I left the farm, I got a degree in animal science, 
because I loved the farm &amp; loved seeing biology all around me growing up. 
Science comes naturally to me. I don&rsquo;t know why. I just get it. I guess 
it&rsquo;s because I was immersed in it all my life. I&rsquo;m also a 
Christian. I trust that God gave me intelligence to use it &amp; put me on that 
farm as a kid to fall in love with science &amp; biology, which led me to be 
the first person in my extended family to attend and graduate from a 4 year 
college. it is a slap in the face to me &amp; farmers for you to say that 
America&rsquo;s farmers don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing &amp; are in 
defiance of God. I&rsquo;m certainly not the only Christian agophile. I&rsquo;d 
wager that many farm families are Christian. I&rsquo;ve yet to read in the 
bible where it says cattle should ONLY eat grass. cattle&rsquo;s digestive 
systems were designed to ferment &amp; grass is not the only substrate that 
ferments.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s best to give up all stuff whose past (Origin and 
Processing cycle) is unknown/ untrustworthy to us.. and derive the calcium and 
protein from nuts and organically grown green leafy vegetables that we clean 
and consume ourselves..</p>

<p>It can be very difficult to trust any scientist from the corporate, 
university or government realm these days because they have a political agenda 
to further, often in order to keep their jobs. This makes them unreliable and 
rather &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo; in their research and conclusions drawn from 
research. This makes OUR jobs extremely difficultas decision makers. I know 
that when I use raw milk products my iron levels increase (low iron,an issue 
all my life) my intestines complain less(another weak spot for me) and I feel 
better almost immediately(days not weeks). I also know when I have bought 
regular homogenized/pastuerized milk in the last 5 years that I cannot keep it 
from spoiling in days, less than a week in almost every case. This becomes a 
poor spending choice for a variety of reasons.Now I buy all raw dairy, it lasts 
a couple weeks then it gently sours. I can still use it and enjoy it, even IF I 
have not made fermented products from it before that. For many reasons, I find 
that raw dairy is a good value for the money, delivers good taste, good 
nutrition and makes me feel better. I also believe in food that has nourished 
people throughout the ages rather than food that is pushed by 
economic/governmental concerns with dubious health results. Call me crazy but I 
do not really trust the government or lobbyists all that much!</p>

<p>Hello all.</p> 
<p>I have been feeling like I NEED to get away from all the chemicals etc in 
food. I have lived in third world countries and know what the difference is, 
though, in the quality of food grown &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;. The Bible says 
that in the end times God will pour out his knowledge onto the earth. 
Scientists don&rsquo;t create anything new. They use what God created whether 
they know it or not. I DO NOT think much of the preservatives and steroids and 
such are that good for us, but, to feed MILLIONS of people&hellip; Can&rsquo;t 
raise many dairy cows in the cities.</p> 
<p>I pray about what I eat, study what I can, be as natural as we are able on 
a low budget, and then let the rest of it sit in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. 
It&rsquo;s all I CAN do, and, in the long-run, it&rsquo;s all I SHOULD do. Fear 
does not come from the Lord. (I sure wish I had time to look up these 
scriptures.</p> 
<p>Thank you for all your research. I am very impressed.</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;interesting. I buy cream top milk because the cows are 
pastured. I can&rsquo;t afford raw milk all the time due to the fact that it is 
8.99 a half gallon here in California so I figure the cream top is the next 
best thing.<br>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to research this and share! There are days 
when I am afraid to eat or buy anything for our family. Our food budget is very 
lean right now, and I feel like I am poisoning, instead or nourishing, my 
family when I can&rsquo;t buy local, organic, pastured, vegan, socially and 
environmentally responsible products. There are soooo many schools of thought 
on food and the politics surrounding them are beginning to feel hostile some 
days.</p> 
<p>I would love to have access to raw milk, both financially and 
geographically. I feel better after reading your post that doing the best I can 
right now (what&rsquo;s on sale at the market) isn&rsquo;t poisoning my family.
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that organizations like Weston Price who have a lot to 
offer, don&rsquo;t use up to date information.<br>

<p>Thanks for sharing all this info! I have powdered milk on the shelf as part 
of our hurricane stash, but I always felt a little &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; about it 
after reading real food blogs. I never had the time to research it, though.</p> 
<p>While eating foods as close to their natural state as possible is generally 
a good thing, I&rsquo;m still in favor of pasteurization. There&rsquo;s a 
reason it was a GREAT invention and it&rsquo;s saved countless lives. I cook my 
meat before eating it, too, to kill off bacteria.</p>

<p>I remember you forwarded this info to me (thank you!) a while ago and I 
meant to reply to you with my thoughts but completely forgot!</p> 
<p>After you had sent it to me, I had the chance to try both homogenized and 
non-homogenized full-fat organic milk from the same company. I was using it to 
make yogurt as I couldn&rsquo;t tolerate drinking pasteurized milk. I switched 
from homogenized to non-homogenized and noticed a big difference in digestion. 
Not only that but the yogurt tasted so much better! I never went back to 
homogenized.</p> 
<p>Now, when I switched to raw sheep milk I noticed an even bigger difference. 
And, I can drink that milk no problem.</p> 
<p>I often don&rsquo;t listen to what scientists say about food. I guess 
I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be so sensitive to everything, that I can tell the 
health difference between certain processing methods. All I know is my 
digestive system definitely did better with the non-homogenized milk. 
Considering how sensitive I am though, this was really not that noticeable. For 
normal healthy people, it might not make any difference at all.<br>

 You know I love personal anecdotes! I totally can&rsquo;t notice 
digestive differences with stuff like this, so I need to hear from folks who 
can. That is so interesting about homogenized vs. non-homog for you. Clearly 
something is changed with the process, and I agree with Kate &ndash; it&rsquo;s 
SO unnecessary that it&rsquo;s a bummer we have to deal with it when we buy 
store milk.<br>
 Thanks for sharing!  Katie</p>

<p>Heather, Shannon makes a good point, that store milk is still inhumanely 
raised, usually, and not the ideal. However, I&rsquo;m such an advocate for 
balance, that I think it&rsquo;s important people not be afraid of something 
they shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of&hellip;just maybe wary of.</p> 
<p>I always feel badly confusing people, b/c I hate that feeling myself. I 
just know that we are all going to live and die, no matter what, and I need to 
release some of my anxiety about food. When my daughter asks for milk at 
Grandma&rsquo;s and gets Meijer brand skim, can I just be uncomfortable instead 
of petrified? That&rsquo;s my goal.<br>

<p>This is a good point, the aunts and uncles and grandparents house is very 
frightening. I never know what my kids are going to get. It actually helps now 
that we have so completely changed our diet to add raw milk, mostly homemade 
(unprocessed products), and eliminated food dye, etc. I have vocalized the 
changes instead of just cringing everytime they offer gummies or red velvet 
cake, now they know it is off limits. I don&rsquo;t limit everthing of course, 
I don&rsquo;t want to be a food nazi. I think it is important to have 
moderation and balance especially for kids. I don&rsquo;t want my kids to 
develop anxiety or obsess about food either.</p>

<p>Yes! Exactly. I have to find a balance between doing what I know is best 
for myself, my family, and the earth, and freaking out about everything all the 
time so that I can&rsquo;t enjoy the good things God provides!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty strict about what my 14-month-old daughter eats (compared 
to everyone else I know, anyway), but I have to give up some of that control 
sometimes. I can&rsquo;t live in fear &mdash; that&rsquo;s not what God wants 
for me, and it&rsquo;s certainly not what he wants me to teach my daughter.</p> 
<p>We do the best with what we have, where we are. I have found that eating 
real food is a journey. Everyone is in a different place, and everyone proceeds 
at a different rate.</p> 
<p>Thank you, Katie, for simply telling the truth, for providing information, 
so that each of us can make an informed, fear-less decision.<br>

<p>Very interesting post, Katie! Given what&rsquo;s been revealed, it is safe 
to say that even if you were to drink homogenized milk because it&rsquo;s not 
as bad as you thought, that same milk would still be pasteurized, which in my 
opinion, is a dead food anyway. I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ve ever seen 
milk that is only homogenized but not pasteurized in the store, but I might be 
wrong.</p> 
<p>As far as the oxidation goes, it would also be safe to say that milk 
powder, which is found in many products, is not safe to consume given the fact 
that if it&rsquo;s not non-fat it contains cholesterol and would contain the 
properties of oxidized cholesterol that were described by Weston A. Price in 
the first place.</p> 
<p>I agree that WAPF should update their information &ndash; but as far as I 
know, even though their site has recently received a facelift, there are still 
many pages of information that remain unaccessible &ndash; I&rsquo;ve tried 
getting to them for a couple of months and they are not available. So I 
don&rsquo;t know what is going on there. Hopefully when those pages are again 
made available for viewing, the information will also receive an update as well.

<p>I too am disappointed that WAPF hasn&rsquo;t updated their stance on 
homogenized milk. I can&rsquo;t quite remember what it was, but it seems like 
there was something similar with another product&hellip;that they had outdated 
info. Maybe I should do a little more of my own research before I believe 
everything NT says. </p> 
<p>Although on homogenized milk, I will agree with Shannon. I&rsquo;ll take it 
as close to the way God created it as possible.</p>

<p>This is a great post!<br>
 I have two comments: first, who did you talk to 
at Meijer? A manager, even in the dairy department might not be aware of what 
is going on with the milk. Whoever it was didn&rsquo;t sound too sure.<br>
 
Second, I have seen listed in the ingredients &ldquo;dry milk solids.&rdquo; I 
took that to mean dry milk powder. The powdered milk may not be in every milk 
anymore, but it IS still in some. It would be interesting to know if the 
labeling laws require the manufacturers to list it? It would seem like they 
would have to&hellip;<br>

<p>Interesting post, Katie!</p> 
<p>I like that you take time to do your own research and don&rsquo;t just 
repeat what everyone else is saying. I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s why you 
have 4000 subscribers when your blog is not yet 2 years old! I always learn a 
lot from you.</p> 
<p>That said, I do agree with the first commenter. I think that the science 
doesn&rsquo;t matter and understanding that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not that 
bad&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as important as focusing on eating whole foods, in their 
natural form, because that&rsquo;s how God designed it to be. I think that 
looking at the science is basically what all the mainstream people (who care in 
the first place) are doing and saying &ldquo;There is no justification for 
going all organic/whole because it really is pretty much fine to eat these 
foods, they are not really different/bad.&rdquo; But we all know the anecdotal 
evidence, that we feel and do so much on whole foods than on processed foods. 
And we have to remember that these &ldquo;tiny effects&rdquo; from the small 
changes to each food really add up over time.</p> 
<p>Sorry to say it  , but I think you&rsquo;re being that food-snob thing that 
Michael Pollan talked about, that thing where you look at food as the sum of 
its nutrient parts instead of as a whole food! I know you love the research and 
I love that you present it (really), but&hellip;whole foods please! Whatever 
science you show me I&rsquo;ll stick to the way God made it!<br>

<p>I am all about whole foods and certainly not advocating the people seek 
adulterated foods, but &ndash; not everyone has the option to go straight to 
the farm, or the energy, or the funds. Sometime you just have to go to the 
store, so it&rsquo;s good to know what&rsquo;s there that IS closest to real,

<p>Everybody deals with all this in the way their personality works. 
That&rsquo;s OK. I am a scientist by nature. I like all the details. Yet, part 
of those details include noticing poorly done research (too many variables to 
draw the correct conclusion from) or seeing the politics shine through( drawing 
the conclusion that benefits the company that paid for the research-or having 
the FDA approve something because lobbyists encouraged them)) I also do not 
believe in the currently fashionable consensus method that says if everybody 
believes it must be true. (Global warming is a good example of this) I also 
take a step-back view on many nutritional issues thinking that if people ate 
lard and wild yeast bread and pasture fed meats for thousands of years and were 
generally healthy, I tend to think that our health is likely MORE affected by 
some foods introduced in the last hundred years. Just think how healthy we 
could be from benefitting from modern nutrition science, benefitting from 
modern medical understandings and eating traditional foods!! It&rsquo;s a 
win/win.<br>
 As far as your pocketbook goes, everyone has to make tough money 
choices and their choices will be based on their own knowledge and situation 
and that is OK. Keep up the great work!</p>

<p>Thank you for a fascinating post! I have subscribed only in the last month 
or so, and have learned so much. I am a scientist married to a physician, and 
have small children. I agree with the earlier post about the benefits of 
pasteurization. Humans throughout history have found many simple ways to make 
our food safer, often by heating, and this is just one more. I know of a family 
who lost a child due to unpasteurized apple juice, and there is currently a 
rash of illness in our area due to raw milk traced to a local farm. Raw milk 
will never be on my grocery list, but I have gone back and forth with 
homogenized (the non-homog bottles were spoiling faster, so I stopped for a 
while), and I only buy organic. I think it is important to be careful about our 
food, and not to overlook true progress, while still making sure it is not 
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; at the expense of nutrition and environment. I have been 
frustrated with some of WPF&rsquo;s articles, because I too found some to be 
outdated or lacking in evidence. I think we all have to do our research, but it 
helps to have an article like this from which to start! Thanks again!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for getting out there and digging this information up for 
us. While I agree that eating and drinking what is closest to what God made is 
ideal, I live in a state where it is illegal to purchase raw milk, milk sold 
for pet consumption has charcoal dye added, AND cow shares are prohibited by 
the language of our law. Because there are all sorts of people trying to make 
the best decisions for their individual families in order to balance budgets 
while eating nourishing meals, I think it is wonderful to see some of the 
science presented from a variety of perspectives. I want to be able to 
confidently make a good choice rather than feeling guilty if I can&rsquo;t 
drive to another state every week to purchase milk.<br>

milk terminology
http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2010/06/22/what-kind-of-milk-should-i-buy/ 
that might help you.</p> 
<p>Basically, although I don&rsquo;t seek out powdered milk, I&rsquo;m trying 
not to be AS afraid of it. I&rsquo;m not afraid of skim milk anymore; in fact, 
I purchase it and add cream to make yogurt, which I wouldn&rsquo;t have done 
had I thought it was laden with oxidized cholesterol.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t love the idea of homogenization, but sometimes I need to rely 
on store milk for yogurt. I buy whole if I don&rsquo;t have enough cream to add 
to skim. I&rsquo;d like to see more research on the homogenization health 
effects, actually.</p>

<p>Thank you for this sincere and informative article! I agree that 
God&rsquo;s wisdom is higher than our own, and his ideas on food are the best!
<br> A few minutes before reading this post, I happened upon a USDA report from 
August 2003, which described the routine addition of nonfat dry milk and 
condensed skim milk to nonfat, low-fat, and reduced fat milk products. 
According to the report, these things can be added to milk, without any mention 
being made on the product labeling. I do not doubt the honesty of your Meyer or 
the local dairy you mentioned, but this recent (7 years ago, not from the 
50&prime;s) report does indicate that these additions are a routine practice in 
federally regulated milk processing plants. Just thought you might like all the 
information available! Thank you for your dedication to this cause. The 
information mentioned is on page 25 of the report, available at this link:</p>

<p>Ok&hellip; so I know that it&rsquo;s been awhile since you wrote this, but 
I followed your link from the Irish Creme post. I was intrigued by what you may 
have to say about powdered milk.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been avoiding it for a number of years, but not for any of the 
reasons you mentioned here. I&rsquo;m a budding real foodie and have only been 
on this track these past 4 years.</p> 
<p>Somewhere in the beginning of all that, I remember reading something about 
formaldehyde in powdered milk. I don&rsquo;t remember if it said it was used in 
making it or if it was that there was some in it&hellip; long story short, I 
haven&rsquo;t been able to find anything about it since and I can&rsquo;t 
remember exactly what it said. Have you heard anything about formaldehyde and 
powdered milk? Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be so &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; of it either?

in my country.</p> 
<p> Here in Canada, antibiotics and growth hormones are not allowed to be used 
in the milk. Budgets concerns are a good justification for using powdered and 
homogenized milk. We just use less of it, but that helps us save money for more 
fruits and vegetables.</p> 
<p>Since our digestion doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind what we can afford, we try 
to do what we can with our grains, beans and other foods with soaking, and 
grinding our own grain and beans. But there is more to life than food, and 
there are a lot of other things I should be focusing my worry energy on than 
worrying about the kind of milk I&rsquo;d like to be able to afford, but 
can&rsquo;t justify or for which I cannot find sources.</p> 
<p>Thank you for a balanced post.</p>

<p>I too had some issues with false/misleading information from the WAPF. 
I&rsquo;m coming to feel that they aren&rsquo;t necessarily a reputable 
resource. I&rsquo;m a dental professor and read this article about dentistry:
http://www.westonaprice.org/dentistry/1957-root-canal-dangers.html The article 
states that &ldquo;Dentists are generally taught to remove a tooth and leave 
the periodontal ligament in the socket, a procedure which would be like 
delivering a baby and leaving the placenta in the uterus.&rdquo; Except that 
this isn&rsquo;t true. I&rsquo;ve been a professor at 2 dental schools and a 
student at 1 and this statement would be considered completely crazy. I teach 
students how to extract teeth and I&rsquo;d be sued if I was teaching them to 
leave the ligament. No one today advocates leaving the periodontal ligament in 
the socket and it is certainly not what &ldquo;dentists are generally 
taught&rdquo;. It isn&rsquo;t even something that is controversial. This 
statement is just wrong. It isn&rsquo;t even a matter of philosophy or opinion. 
This isn&rsquo;t what dentists are taught. I know. I&rsquo;m teaching them!</p>

<p>Interesting take on the homogenization issue. I&rsquo;m glad to see you 
asking questions, not just of the milk producers but those at the WAPF and the 
Nourishing Traditions book.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t see much purpose in homogenizing, so I would prefer to drink 
my own goat milk, which is of course not homogenized.</p> 
<p>However, I think pasteurizing is important and that the dangers and 
outbreaks are completely ignored by the raw milk community. Its just not worth 
it to me.</p>

<p>My personal experience with homogenized vs raw milk and cream is simple and 
enough to justify never putting homogenized/pasteurized dairy in my body.</p> 
<p>I drink cream in my milk. Simply put, when I use homogenized cream I have 
leg cramps and swelling of my feet. When I use raw cream I do not. I 
don&rsquo;t need a researcher to tell me what&rsquo;s going on here, the 
evidence is in my body&rsquo;s reaction.</p> 
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s quite arrogant of humans to believe they can engineer 
food better than either God or evolution. We either evolved by thriving on the 
foods that are on this planet or God put the right foods on the planet to 
nourish humans. The danger comes when we industrialize food and eat what 
multi-national corporations wants us too for their profit.</p> 
<p>Food production should be a livelihood, not an publicly traded &ldquo;for 
profit&rdquo; industry. Industry doesn&rsquo;t care if you die slowly while 
they have huge profits and great Wall Street returns.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not against large corporations, Starbucks treats the people they 
buy from, their employees and customers with respect., but they are the unusual 
case and not the norm.</p>

<p>I have been reading your posts on yogurt and milk, especially in regards to 
UHT milk. I currently live in eastern Europe and the only kind of milk I can 
get is UHT. Based on what I have read here and on other sites, UHT milk is not 
that great, safe or healthy correct? Can you suggest any alternatives? Powdered 
milk maybe? Can I make yogurt with powdered milk? Just curious what you would 
suggest. Thanks!</p>

<p>Where I live, in Canada, it&rsquo;s ILLEGAL for farms to sell raw milk. 
Crazy, I know. Thanks for your research!</p>

<p>Funny how so many want or have trouble believing the scientists, and yet 
all the scare stories about Homogenizing and Drying milk come from scientists. 
The facts around the scary dry milk are these, NO ONE KNOWS. It is just a 
theory! The real facts are these: The body produces oxidized cholesterol, and 
there is even some research that shows some beneficial properties of oxidized 
cholesterol. So you see, the jury is still out on this subject.</p> 
<p> FYI &mdash; powdered milk actually has very low levels of oxidized 
cholesterol.</p> 
<p> Research will continue on this controversial topic. Meanwhile, there is no 
reason to avoid powdered milk if you like it. It is a good source of protein 
and calcium and hardly any fat or cholesterol &mdash; oxidized or unoxidized.
</p> 
<p>But go ahead and be scared. I am a Christian, and have to admit that there 
are hundreds of things God never intended us to do: use computers, drive cars, 
fly in airplanes, eat food you didn&rsquo;t produce yourselves, watch Tv or 
listen to the radio, read mass produced books, or any book etc other than the 
Bible (which is my most read book (and don&rsquo;t you hate how Bible is no 
longer capitalized?). My point is I don&rsquo;t think God minds that much about 
what we take into our bodies (oooooh isn&rsquo;t that a verse???)</p>

<p>Perhaps people choose to believe the scientific studies that aren&rsquo;t 
backed by the companies that stand to benefit financially from the results of 
the study. Perhaps people learned that if there&rsquo;s a profit to be made, 
the study is probably biased. Perhaps some to choose to err on the side of 
caution when &ldquo;the jury is still out&rdquo;. Perhaps those that avoid man 
made foods are not scared in the sense your reply suggests. How do you know if 
God intended one thing or another? His word certainly supports taking good care 
of our bodies and that would include what goes into it. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 
states, &ldquo;19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy 
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For 
you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body[a] and in your 
spirit, which are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes, I do hate that Bible is rarely capitalized. On that we agree.</p>
