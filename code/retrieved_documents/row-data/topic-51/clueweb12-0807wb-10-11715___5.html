<p>A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal, often shown by a 
thermometer reading of over 100.4&deg;F/38&deg;C. Body temperature can vary 
with age, activity/exertion level, clothing, and even the time of day. 
(Everyone&rsquo;s temperature tends to be lower early in the morning and higher 
between late afternoon and early evening.)</p> 
<p>A fever is generally harmless and will help a child to fight infection. It 
shows that the child&rsquo;s immune system is working and the body is trying to 
rid itself of the infection. An increased body temperature is often a response 
to illness caused by a virus or bacteria, and except in the case of heat stroke 
fever itself is not the illness, only the symptom and a part of the 
body&rsquo;s defence, and therefore does not necessarily signal a need for 
antibiotics.</p> 
<p>A fever is often identified by the child appearing flushed, perspiring, and 
wanting more fluids than usual. When a child has a fever, the heart and 
breathing rates will naturally speed up, and the child will feel warmer to the 
touch. They will also often have symptoms of the illness that has caused the 
fever, such as an earache, sore throat, rash, or stomach ache. These signs will 
help to identify the cause of the fever, which could range from a common cold 
and/or ear infection, to poisoning, pneumonia, and heat stroke, and it is 
therefore essential that the cause is identified as soon as possible.</p> 
<p>Most of the time fever in a child is harmless and there does not require 
the attention of a doctor. However, there are situations where a pediatrician 
should be consulted: If the child looks very ill and is unusually drowsy or 
very fussy; if there are additional symptoms, such as a stiff neck, severe 
headache, severe sore throat, severe ear pain, an unexplained rash, and 
repeated vomiting or diarrhoea; if the child has been in an extremely hot 
place, such as an overheated car; if the child has had a seizure; or if the 
child has a condition that suppresses immune responses, or is taking steroids.
</p> 
<p>Generally, children over 6 months old who have a fever of less than 
101&deg;F/38.3&deg;C do not need to be treated for fever, unless the child is 
uncomfortable. To make the child more comfortable, try to keep the room cool, 
keep the child dressed in light clothing, encourage the consumption of fluids 
(water, diluted fruit juices, or commercially prepared oral electrolyte 
solutions), and ensure that there is no overexertion.</p> 
<p>There are also medications which can reduce a fever: acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen are safe and effective in proper doses, although ibuprofen should 
only be used for children older than 6 months of age, and not given to children 
who are vomiting constantly or are dehydrated. Aspirin should not be given to 
children under the age of 16 as use in children has been known to cause side 
effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding and, most seriously, Reye 
syndrome.</p> 
<p>If the child is vomiting and unable to take medication, then the 
pediatrician may recommend an acetaminophen suppository. A pediatrician should 
be consulted before giving any medication to a child under 2 years of age.</p> 
<p>An alternative way of reducing fever in children is through sponging with 
lukewarm water, as the evaporating water on the skin can reduce the body 
temperature. A pediatrician may recommend this if the child&rsquo;s temperature 
is above 104&deg;F (40&deg;C); if the child is vomiting and unable to take 
medication; or if the child has had a febrile seizure in the past.</p> 
<p>The pediatrician would advise on the method of sponging, but it is 
important not to use cold water, as this could cause shivering, and in turn, 
increase the body temperature. Usually 5-10 minutes in a bath is enough time 
for a child&rsquo;s temperature to start dropping. If the child is upset by the 
bath, or continues to shiver, it is better to end the sponging, even if there 
has not been enough time spent in the water to reduce the temperature. It is 
also important not to try and reduce the child&rsquo;s temperature too quickly, 
as this could also cause the temperature to rebound higher.</p> 
<p>When a child has a fever, remember that this is the body&rsquo;s natural 
defense to fight off an infection, and this is healthy and normal, and should 
only cause concern if the child appears very sick, or if the fever persists for 
more than 24 hours (in children under than 2 years of age), at which point a 
pediatrician should be consulted.</p> <br>
