Suspension (0045-0448) ibuprofen 100 milligram in 5 
milliliter <br>
<br>
<br>
 Indications <br>
<br>

<p>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of MOTRIN Suspension 
and other treatment options before deciding to use MOTRIN Suspension. Use the 
lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual 
patient treatment goals (seeWARNINGS).</p>  In Pediatric Patients, MOTRIN 
Suspension is indicated:<br>

<ul> 
<li>For reduction of fever in patients aged 6 months up to 2 years of age.</li>
<li>For relief of mild to moderate pain in patients aged 6 months up to 2 
years of age.</li> 
<li>For relief of signs and symptoms of juvenile arthritis.</li> </ul>  In 
Adults, MOTRIN is indicated:<br>

<ul> 
<li>For treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.</li> 
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis.</li> </ul>
<p>Since there have been no controlled trials to demonstrate whether there is 
any beneficial effect or harmful interaction with the use of ibuprofen in 
conjunction with aspirin, the combination cannot be recommended. (See
PRECAUTIONS &ndash; Drug Interactions).</p> <br>
 Dosage <br>
<br>

<p>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of MOTRIN Suspension 
and other treatment options before deciding to use MOTRIN Suspension. Use the 
lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual 
patient treatment goals (seeWARNINGS).</p>
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with MOTRIN Suspension, the 
dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p>
 PEDIATRIC PATIENTS<br>

<p> Fever reduction: For reduction of fever in children, 6 months up to 2 
years of age, the dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the initial 
temperature level (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg 
if the baseline temperature is less than 102.5&ordm;F, or 10 mg/kg if the 
baseline temperature is 102.5&ordm;F or greater. The duration of fever 
reduction is generally 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 
mg/kg.</p>
<p>Analgesia: For relief of mild to moderate pain in children 6 months up to 2 
years of age, the recommended dosage is 10 mg/kg, every 6 to 8 hours. The 
recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg. Doses should be given so as not to 
disturb the child's sleep pattern.</p>
<p>Juvenile Arthritis: The recommended dose is 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided into 
three to four doses (seeIndividualization of Dosage). Patients with milder 
disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day.</p>
<p>In patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not 
recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper 
recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious 
adverse events. The therapeutic response may require from a few days to several 
weeks to be achieved. Once a clinical effect is obtained, the dosage should be 
lowered to the smallest dose of MOTRIN needed to maintain adequate control of 
symptoms.</p>
<p>Pediatric patients receiving doses above 30 mg/kg/day or if abnormal liver 
function tests have occurred with previous NSAID treatments should be carefully 
followed for signs and symptoms of early liver dysfunction.</p>  ADULTS <br>

<p>Primary Dysmenorrhea: For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, beginning 
with the earliest onset of such pain, MOTRIN Suspension should be given in a 
dose of 400 mg every 4 hours, as necessary, for the relief of pain.</p>
<p> Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis: Suggested dosage: 1200-3200 mg 
daily (300 mg q.i.d. or 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.). Individual 
patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, 
although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a 
better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients 
with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical 
benefits to offset potential increased risk.</p>
<p>Individualization of Dosage: The dose of MOTRIN Suspension should be 
tailored to each patient, and may be lowered or raised from the suggested doses 
depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy 
or as the patient responds or fails to respond.</p>
<p>One fever study showed that, after the initial dose of MOTRIN Suspension, 
subsequent doses may be lowered and still provide adequate fever control.</p>
<p>In a situation when low fever would require the MOTRIN Suspension 5 mg/kg 
dose in a child with pain, the dose that will effectively treat the predominant 
symptom should be chosen.</p>
<p>In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to MOTRIN Suspension therapy 
is sometimes seen in a few days to a week, but most often is observed by two 
weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose 
should be reviewed and adjusted as required.</p>
<p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses than do 
patients with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose of MOTRIN Suspension that 
yields acceptable control should be employed.</p>
<p>MOTRIN Suspension may be used in combination with gold salts and/or 
corticosteroids.</p> <br>
 Overdosage <br>
<br>

<p>The toxicity of ibuprofen overdose is dependent upon the amount of drug 
ingested and the time elapsed since ingestion, though individual response may 
vary, which makes it necessary to evaluate each case individually. Although 
uncommon, serious toxicity and death have been reported in the medical 
literature with ibuprofen overdosage. The most frequently reported symptoms of 
ibuprofen overdose include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy and 
drowsiness. Other central nervous system symptoms include headache, tinnitus, 
CNS depression and seizures. Metabolic acidosis, coma, acute renal failure and 
apnea (primarily in very young children) may rarely occur. Cardiovascular 
toxicity, including hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia and atrial 
fibrillation, also have been reported.</p>
<p>The treatment of acute ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive. 
Management of hypotension, acidosis and gastrointestinal bleeding may be 
necessary. In cases of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied through 
ipecac-induced emesis or lavage. Emesis is most effective if initiated within 
30 minutes of ingestion. Orally administered activated charcoal may help in 
reducing the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen.</p>
<p>In children, the estimated amount of ibuprofen ingested per body weight may 
be helpful to predict the potential for development of toxicity although each 
case must be evaluated. Ingestion of less than 100 mg/kg is unlikely to produce 
toxicity. Children ingesting 100 to 200 mg/kg may be managed with induced 
emesis and a minimal observation time of four hours. Children ingesting 200 to 
400 mg/kg of ibuprofen should have immediate gastric emptying and at least four 
hours observation in a health care facility. Children ingesting greater than 
400 mg/kg require immediate medical referral, careful observation and 
appropriate supportive therapy. Ipecac-induced emesis is not recommended in 
overdoses greater than 400 mg/kg because of the risk for convulsions and the 
potential for aspiration of gastric contents.</p>
<p>In adult patients the history of the dose reportedly ingested does not 
appear to be predictive of toxicity. The need for referral and follow-up must 
be judged by the circumstances at the time of the overdose ingestion. 
Symptomatic adults should be carefully evaluated, observed and supported.</p> 
<br>  Contraindications <br>
<br>

<p>MOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated in patients with known 
hypersensitivity to ibuprofen.</p>
<p>MOTRIN Suspension should not be given to patients who have experienced 
asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDS have been 
reported in such patients (seeWARNINGS &ndash; Anaphylactoid Reactions, and 
PRECAUTIONS &ndash; Preexisting Asthma).</p>
<p>MOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative 
pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (seeWARNINGS
).</p> <br>
 Warnings <br>
<br>
 Boxed Warning <br>
<br>

<p></p>  Cardiovascular Risk <br>

<ul> 
<li>NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic 
events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may 
increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk (seeWARNINGS).</li> 
<li>MOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative 
pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (seeWARNINGS
).</li> </ul>  Gastrointestinal Risk <br>

<ul> 
<li>NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events 
including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, 
which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without 
warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious 
gastrointestinal events (seeWARNINGS).</li> </ul>  CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS <br>
 
Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<br>

<p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 
three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular 
(CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. 
All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. 
Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater 
risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients 
treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV 
events and the steps to take if they occur.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates 
the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. 
The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (seeGI WARNINGS).</p>
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).
</p>  Hypertension <br>

<p>NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can lead to onset of new hypertension 
or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to 
the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop 
diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, should be used with caution in patients 
with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p>  
Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<br>

<p>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking 
NSAIDs. MOTRIN Suspension should be used with caution in patients with fluid 
retention or heart failure.</p>  Gastrointestinal Effects &ndash; Risk of 
Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<br>

<p>NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can cause serious gastrointestinal 
(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and 
perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be 
fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without 
warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, 
who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. 
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in 
approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of 
patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk.</p>
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with aprior 
history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs 
have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients 
with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI 
bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, 
use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous 
reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and 
therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p>  Renal Effects <br>

<p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis 
and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom 
renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal 
perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin 
formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt 
renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with 
impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy 
is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p>  Advanced Renal 
Disease<br>

<p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the 
use of MOTRIN Suspension in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, 
treatment with MOTRIN Suspension is not recommended in these patients with 
advanced renal disease. If MOTRIN Suspension therapy must be initiated, close 
monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</p>  Anaphylactoid 
Reactions<br>

<p>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without 
known prior exposure to MOTRIN Suspension. MOTRIN Suspension should not be 
given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs 
in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or 
who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or 
other NSAIDs (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS &ndash; Preexisting Asthma). 
Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.
</p>  Skin Reactions <br>

<p>NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can cause serious skin adverse events 
such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur 
without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the 
first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p>  
Pregnancy<br>

<p>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, MOTRIN should be avoided because 
it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p> <br>
 Special 
Precautions <br>
<br>
 General <br>

<p>MOTRIN Suspension cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or 
to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of 
corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision 
is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p>
<p>The pharmacological activity of MOTRIN Suspension in reducing fever and 
inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>  Hepatic 
Effects<br>

<p>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of 
patients taking NSAIDs including MOTRIN Suspension. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with 
continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or 
more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported.</p>
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in 
whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of 
the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with MOTRIN 
Suspension. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease 
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), 
MOTRIN Suspension should be discontinued.</p>  Hematological Effects <br>

<p>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including MOTRIN 
Suspension. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, 
or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, should have their 
hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of 
anemia.</p>
<p>In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreased 
hemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease in hemoglobin 
of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193 patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen 
daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of 189 patients taking 2400 mg of 
ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis). Positive stool occult blood tests and 
elevated serum creatinine levels were also observed in these studies.</p>
<p>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
MOTRIN Suspension who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet 
function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving 
anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</p>  Preexisting Asthma <br>

<p>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin 
in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe 
bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, MOTRIN Suspension should 
not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and 
should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</p>  Aseptic 
Meningitis<br>

<p>Aseptic meningitis, with fever and coma, has been observed on rare 
occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely 
to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective 
tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying 
chronic disease.</p>  Diabetics <br>

<p>MOTRIN Suspension contains 0.3 g sucrose and 1.6 calories per mL, or 1.5 g 
sucrose and 8 calories per teaspoon, which should be taken into consideration 
when treating diabetic patients with this product.</p>  Information for 
Patients:<br>

<p>Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating 
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. 
Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that 
accompanies each prescription dispensed.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>MOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, 
such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization, and even death. 
Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should 
be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, 
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing 
any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance 
of this follow-up (seeWARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects).</li> 
<li>MOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, 
serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in 
hospitalization or even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and 
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for signs 
and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice 
when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, 
dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the 
importance of this follow-up (seeWARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects: Risk of 
Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).</li> 
<li>MOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects 
such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in 
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur 
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin 
rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, 
and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or 
symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they 
develop any type of rash or contact their physicians as soon as possible.</li> 
<li>Patients should promptly reports signs and symptoms of unexplained weight 
gain or edema to their physicians.</li> 
<li>Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritis, jaundice, right 
upper quadrant tenderness, and &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms). If these occur, 
patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical 
therapy.</li> 
<li>Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction 
(e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, 
patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (seeWARNINGS).
</li> 
<li>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, MOTRIN Suspension should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</li> 
</ol>  Laboratory Tests <br>

<p>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning 
symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. 
Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a 
chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
MOTRIN Suspension should be discontinued.</p>  Drug Interactions <br>
 
ACE-inhibitors<br>

<p>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of 
ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients 
taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</p>  Aspirin <br>

<p>As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of IBUPROFEN and aspirin 
is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse 
effects.</p>  Diuretics <br>

<p>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that 
MOTRIN Suspension can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides 
in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient 
should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (seeWARNINGS, Renal 
Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</p>  Lithium <br>

<p>Ibuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in 
renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers. The mean 
minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance of lithium 
was decreased by 19% during this period of concomitant drug administration. 
This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis 
by ibuprofen. Thus, when MOTRIN and lithium are administered concurrently, 
subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. (Read 
circulars for lithium preparation before use of such concurrent therapy.)</p>  
Methotrexate<br>

<p>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</p>  Warfarin <br>

<p>Several short-term controlled studies failed to show that MOTRIN tablets 
significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of other clotting factors 
when administered to individuals on warfarin-type anticoagulants. However, 
because bleeding has been reported when MOTRIN tablets and other NSAIDs have 
been administered to patients on warfarin-type anticoagulants, the physician 
should be cautious when administering MOTRIN tablets to patients on 
anticoagulants. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious 
GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</p>  Pregnancy <br>
 
Teratogenic Effects &ndash; Pregnancy Category C<br>

<p>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated 
evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies 
are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Motrin should be used in pregnancy 
only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>  
Nonteratogenic Effects<br>

<p>Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the 
fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during 
pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</p>  Labor and 
Delivery<br>

<p>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of MOTRIN 
Suspension on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Therefore, 
administration of MOTRIN Suspension is not recommended during labor and 
delivery.</p>  Nursing Mothers <br>

<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many 
drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants from MOTRIN suspension, a decision should 
be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>  Pediatric Use <br>

<p>Safety and effectiveness of MOTRIN Suspension in pediatric patients below 
the age of 6 months have not been established (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - 
Clinical Studies). Dosing of MOTRIN Suspension in children 6 months or older 
should be guided by their body weight (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>  
Geriatric Use<br>

<p>As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 
years and older).</p> <br>
 Adverse Drug Reactions <br>

<p>In patients taking MOTRIN or other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported 
adverse experiences occurring in approximately 1-10% of patients are: Abnormal

 Description <br>
<br>

<p>The active ingredient in MOTRIN is ibuprofen, which is a member of the 
propionic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of [+]S- and [-]R-enantiomers. It is a white to 
off-white crystalline powder, with a melting point of 74&deg; to 77&deg;C. It 
is practically insoluble in water (&lt;0.1 mg/mL), but readily soluble in 
organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone. Ibuprofen has a pKa of 
4.43&plusmn;0.03 and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 11.7 at pH 
7.4. The chemical name for ibuprofen is (&plusmn;)-2-(p-isobutylphenyl) 
propionic acid. The molecular weight of ibuprofen is 206.28. Its molecular 
formula is C13H1802 and it has the following structural formula:</p> <br>

<p>MOTRIN Suspension is a sucrose-sweetened, orange colored, berry flavored 
suspension containing 100 mg of ibuprofen in 5 mL (20 mg/mL). Inactive 
ingredients include: acesulfame-K, citric acid, glycerin, polysorbate 80, 
pregelatinized starch, purified water, sodium benzoate, sucrose, xanthan gum, 
and natural and artificial flavors. It also may contain one or several of the 
following colorants: FD&amp;C Red #40, D&amp;C Yellow #10, D&amp;C Red #33, and 
FD&amp;C Blue #1.</p> <br>
 Mechanism of Action <br>
<br>
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
<br>
<p>Pharmacodynamics - Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. 
Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, 
but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. After absorption of 
the racemic ibuprofen, the [-]R-enantiomer undergoes interconversion to the 
[+]S-form. The biological activities of ibuprofen are associated with the 
[+]S-enantiomer.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics - Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of [-]R-and [+]S-isomers. 
In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the [+]S-isomer is responsible for 
clinical activity. The [-]R-form, while thought to be pharmacologically 
inactive, is slowly and incompletely (~60%) interconverted into the active [+]S 
species in adults. The degree of interconversion in children is unknown, but is 
thought to be similar. The [-]R-isomer serves as a circulating reservoir to 
maintain levels of active drug. Ibuprofen is well absorbed orally, with less 
than 1% being excreted in the urine unchanged. It has a biphasic elimination 
time curve with a plasma half-life of approximately 2 hours. Studies in febrile 
children have established the dose-proportionality of 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of 
ibuprofen. Studies in adults have established the dose-proportionality of 
ibuprofen as a single oral dose from 50 to 600 mg for total drug and up to 1200 
mg for free drug.</p>
<p>Absorption - In vivo studies indicate that ibuprofen is well absorbed 
orally from the suspension formulation, with peak plasma levels usually 
occurring within 1 to 2 hours (seeTable 1).</p>  Table 1 Pharmacokinetic

<p>Antacids - A bioavailability study in adults has shown that there was no 
interference with the absorption of ibuprofen when given in conjunction with an 
antacid containing both aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.</p>
<p>H-2 Antagonists&ndash; In studies with human volunteers, coadministration 
of cimetidine or ranitidine with ibuprofen had no substantive effect on 
ibuprofen serum concentrations.</p>
<p>Food Effects - Absorption is most rapid when MOTRIN is given under fasting 
conditions. Administration of MOTRIN Suspension with food affects the rate but 
not the extent of absorption. When taken with food, Tmax is delayed by 
approximately 30 to 60 minutes, and peak levels are reduced by approximately 30 
to 50%.</p>
<p>Distribution - Ibuprofen, like most drugs of its class, is highly protein 
bound (&gt;99% bound at 20&mu;g/mL). Protein binding is saturable and at 
concentrations &gt;20&mu;g/mL binding is non-linear. Based on oral dosing data 
there is an age- or fever- related change in volume of distribution for 
ibuprofen. Febrile children &lt;11 years old have a volume of approximately 0.2 
L/kg while adults have a volume of approximately 0.12 L/kg. The clinical 
significance of these findings is unknown.</p>
<p>Metabolism - Following oral administration, the majority of the dose was 
recovered in the urine within 24 hours as the hydroxy-(25%) and 
carboxypropyl-(37%) phenylpropionic acid metabolites. The percentages of free 
and conjugated ibuprofen found in the urine were approximately 1% and 14%, 
respectively. The remainder of the drug was found in the stool as both 
metabolites and unabsorbed drug.</p>
<p>Elimination - Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. 
The excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. 
It has a biphasic plasma elimination time curve with a half-life of 
approximately 2.0 hours. There is no difference in the observed terminal 
elimination rate or half-life between children and adults, however, there is an 
age-or fever-related change in total clearance. This suggests that the observed 
change in clearance is due to changes in the volume of distribution of 
ibuprofen (seeTable 1 for Cl/F values).</p>
<p>Clinical Studies - Controlled clinical trials comparing doses of 5 and 10 
mg/kg ibuprofen suspension and 10-15 mg/kg of acetaminophen elixir have been 
conducted in children 6 months to 12 years of age with fever primarily due to 
viral illnesses. In these studies there were no differences between treatments 
in fever reduction for the first hour and maximum fever reduction occurred 
between 2 and 4 hours. Response after 1 hour was dependent on both the level of 
temperature elevation as well as the treatment. In children with baseline 
temperatures at or below 102.5&deg;F both ibuprofen doses and acetaminophen 
were equally effective in their maximum effect. In children with temperatures 
above 102.5&deg;F, the ibuprofen 10 mg/kg dose was more effective. By 6 hours, 
children treated with ibuprofen 5mg/kg tended to have recurrence of fever, 
whereas children treated with ibuprofen 10 mg/kg still had significant fever 
reduction at 8 hours. In control groups treated with 10 mg/kg acetaminophen, 
fever reduction resembled that seen in children treated with 5 mg/kg of 
ibuprofen, with the exception that temperature elevation tended to return 1-2 
hours earlier.</p>
<p>In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen has been shown to reduce 
elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrual fluid and to reduce 
testing and active intrauterine pressure, as well as the frequency of uterine 
contractions. The probable mechanism of action is to inhibit prostaglandin 
synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia.</p> <br>
