Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of prolonged and severetiredness or 
weariness (fatigue) that is not relieved by rest and is not directly caused by 
other conditions. To be diagnosed with this condition, your tiredness must be 
severe enough to decrease your ability to participate in ordinary activities by 
50%.<br>
<br>
 According to Medilexicon's medical dictionary: <br>
<br>

<blockquote> <i><b> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome </b> is a syndrome of persistent 
incapacitating weakness or fatigue, accompanied by nonspecific somatic 
symptoms, lasting at least 6 months, and not attributable to any known cause.
</i> </blockquote> <br>
<br>
 Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS or ME/CFS) is much 
more than just being tired a lot. People with ME/CFS are so run down that it 
interferes with their lives and can make it hard to function at all. Some 
people with ME/CFS say they have trouble staying on top of their 
responsibilities at home and on the job, while others are severely disabled and 
even bedridden. Furthermore, they're not just dealing with extreme fatigue but 
with a wide range of other symptoms, including flu-like symptoms and chronic 
pain.<br>
<br>
 When referring to chronic fatigue syndrome, patients and 
patient advocates often prefer to call the condition chronic fatigue and immune 
dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) to convey the complexity of the illness and its 
profound impact on people's lives.<br>
<br>
 For unknown reasons CFS occurs 
most often in people in their 40s and 50s, more often in women than men, and is 
less prevalent among children and adolescents.<br>
<br>
 Employment rates 
through the past decade vary with over half unable to work and nearly 
two-thirds limited in their work because of their illness. More than half were 
on disability benefits or temporary sick leave, and less than a fifth worked 
full-time.<br>
<br>
 Literature on ME/CFS (by different names) dates back to 
the 1700s. Through the centuries, it's been falsely attributed to various 
causes and is only now beginning to be better understood by medical science.
<h2>What are the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?</h2> A symptom is 
something the patient senses and describes, while a sign is something other 
people, such as the doctor notice. For example, drowsiness may be a symptom 
while dilated pupils may be a sign.<br>
<br>
 Symptoms of CFS are similar to 
those of most common viral infections (muscle aches,headache, and fatigue). 
They come on within a few hours or days and last for 6 months or more.<br>
<br>

 Examples of chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms include headaches, tender lymph 
nodes,sore throat, muscle pain, joint pain, feeling tired, and feeling 
discomfort after physical exertion. These symptoms either stay with a person or 
come and go for more than six months. It's important to note that the signs and 
symptoms are often similar to those of other health conditions.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Patients report critical reductions in levels of physical activity and a 
reduction in the complexity of activity has been observed, with reported 
impairment comparable to other fatiguing medical conditions such as late-stage
AIDS, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), and the effects of chemotherapy. CFS affects a person's functional 
status and well-being more than major medical conditions such asmultiple 
sclerosis, congestive heart failure, or type II diabetes mellitus. While some 
lead relatively normal lives, others are totally bed-ridden and unable to care 
for themselves.<br>
<br>

<h2>What are the causes of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?</h2> The cause of CFS is 
unknown. To discover possible triggers, researchers are studying the 
relationship betweenstress, the immune system, toxins, the central nervous 
system, and activation of latent virus.<br>
<br>
 Some researchers suspect it 
may be caused by a virus, such as Epstein-Barr virus or humanherpes virus-6 
(HHV-6). However, no specific virus has been identified as the cause.<br>
<br>
 
Studies suggest that CFS may be caused by inflammation along the nervous 
system, and that this inflammation may be some sort of immune response or 
process.<br>
<br>
 Other factors such as age, prior illness, stress, 
environment, or genetics may also play a role.
<h2>Diagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h2> Since there is not a specific lab 
test that reliably identifies chronic fatigue syndrome, and because CFS closely 
resembles other illnesses such as mononucleosis,fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, and 
multiple sclerosis, the first diagnostic step usually involves a series of 
tests that will help the physician rule out other illnesses.<br>
<br>

<h2>What are the treatment options for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?</h2> The main 
goal of CFS treatment is to achieve symptom relief.<br>
<br>
 CFS patients 
should avoid overexertion and physical and emotional stress. Moderate exercise 
that is monitored by a doctor or physical therapist may improve symptoms. Light 
exercise and stretching four hours before bedtime may help with sleep.<br>
<br>

 Cognitive behavioral therapy, activity pacing, and envelope theory can help 
moderate activity and spread it evenly throughout the day, without overexertion.
<br> <br>
 Medications used to treat specific symptoms of CFS include 
antidepressants to help improve sleep and relievedepression, anti-anxiety drugs 
to treat panic disorders, acetaminophen (Tylenol); aspirin (Bayer); and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen (eg, Advil, 
Motrin) to treat pain andfever. <br>
<br>
 Stimulants may be helpful, but 
strong stimulants may cause the &quot;push-crash cycle&quot; and lead to 
relapse.
<h2>Preventing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h2> There are no guidelines for 
preventing CFS because the cause is unknown.<br>
