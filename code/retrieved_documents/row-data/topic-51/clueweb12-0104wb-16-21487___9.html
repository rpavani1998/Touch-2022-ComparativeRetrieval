 Fever and temperature taking <br>

<p>When your child is sick with an infection (caused by either bacteria or a 
virus), it is common to have a fever. Afever will not hurt your child. Usually, 
it goes away after 72 hours (3 days).</p> 
<p><strong>Babies younger than 6 months old should see a doctor when they have 
a fever.</strong></p> 
<p>Older children can be treated at home, as long as they get enough liquids 
and seem well otherwise.</p> 
<p>However, they should also see a doctor if their fever lasts for more than 
72 hours.</p> 
<p><strong>There are several ways to take your child&rsquo;s temperature:
</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>rectal method (by the rectum or &lsquo;bum&rsquo;)</li> 
<li>oral method (by the mouth)</li> 
<li>axillary method (under the armpit)</li> 
<li>temporal artery method (forehead)</li> 
<li>tympanic method (in the ear)</li> </ul> 
<p>The right method depends on your child&rsquo;s age. It&rsquo;s important 
that the measurement is accurate. For instance, taking a rectal temperature is 
still the best way to get an exact reading for children under 2 years of age. 
Although taking a temperature under the armpit isn&rsquo;t as reliable, it may 
let you know whether your child has a fever. Products for taking temporal 
artery temperature at home have not yet been shown to be accurate or reliable 
enough.</p>

<h2>Temperature-taking tips</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not use a mercury thermometer. If it breaks, you might be exposed to 
this toxic substance.</li> 
<li>Do not use an oral thermometer to take a rectal temperature, or a rectal 
thermometer for oral temperature taking.</li> 
<li>A digital thermometer can be used for both rectal and oral temperature 
taking. It&rsquo;s made of unbreakable plastic, is easy to read and measures 
temperature quickly.</li> 
<li>Ear thermometers are expensive and can be hard to use.</li> 
<li>Fever strips are not recommended because they do not give accurate 
readings.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>To get an accurate reading of your child&rsquo;s temperature, 
you&rsquo;ll need to make sure it&rsquo;s done right.</strong> Here&rsquo;s how:
</p> 
<p><strong>Rectum</strong><br>
 This method is the most reliable way to ensure 
afever is not missed.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.</li> 
<li>Cover the silver tip with petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline).</li> 
<li>Place your baby on his back with his knees bent.</li> 
<li>Gently insert the thermometer in the rectum, about 2.5 cm (1 inch), 
holding it in place with your fingers.</li> 
<li>After about 1 minute, you will hear the beep.</li> 
<li>Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.</li> 
<li>Clean the thermometer.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Mouth</strong><br>
 The mouth (oral) method is not recommended for 
children younger than 5 years old, because it is hard for them to hold the 
thermometer under their tongue for long enough.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.</li> 
<li>Carefully place the tip of the thermometer under your child&rsquo;s tongue.
</li> 
<li>With your child&rsquo;s mouth closed, leave the thermometer in place for 
about 1 minute, until you hear the beep.</li> 
<li>Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.</li> 
<li>Clean the thermometer.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Armpit</strong><br>
 The armpit (axillary) method is usually used 
to check forfever in newborns and young children but is not as accurate as a 
rectal temperature. If an axillary temperature does not show afever but your 
child feels warm and seems unwell, take a rectal measurement.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a rectal or oral thermometer.</li> 
<li>Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.</li> 
<li>Place the tip of the thermometer in the centre of the armpit.</li> 
<li>Make sure your child&rsquo;s arm is tucked snugly against her body.</li> 
<li>Leave the thermometer in place for about 1 minute, until you hear the 
&ldquo;beep.&rdquo;</li> 
<li>Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.</li> 
<li>Clean the thermometer.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Ear</strong><br>
 Though quick to use, the ear (tympanic) method 
can produce temperature readings that are too low, even when the 
manufacturer&rsquo;s directions are followed. It is not considered to be as 
reliable or accurate as rectal temperature taking.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a clean probe tip each time, and follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s 
instructions carefully.</li> 
<li>Gently tug on the ear, pulling it back. This will help straighten the ear 
canal, and make a clear path inside the ear to the ear drum.</li> 
<li>Gently insert the thermometer until the ear canal is fully sealed off.</li>
<li>Squeeze and hold down the button for one second.</li> 
<li>Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.</li> </ul> 
<h2>What is a normal temperature?</h2> 
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve taken the temperature, check the following chart to 
see if your child has a fever. The normal temperature range varies, depending 
on the method you use.</p> <strong>Method</strong> <strong>Normal temperature 
range</strong> <br>
Rectum 36.6&deg;C to 38&deg;C (97.9&deg;F to 100.4&deg;F) 
<br> Mouth 35.5&deg;C to 37.5&deg;C (95.9&deg;F to 99.5&deg;F) <br>
Armpit 
34.7&deg;C to 37.3&deg;C (94.5&deg;F to 99.1&deg;F) <br>
Ear 35.8&deg;C to 
38&deg;C (96.4&deg;F to 100.4&deg;F) <br>
<br>

<p>The degree of a fever does not tell you how serious your child&rsquo;s 
illness is. How a child acts is usually a better sign. A child with a mild 
infection can have a high fever, while a child with a severe infection might 
have nofever at all. </p> 
<h2>What can I do if my child has a fever?</h2> 
<p>Keep your child comfortable, and offer plenty of fluids. If your baby has a 
fever, remove extra blankets and clothing so heat can leave her body and help 
lower the body temperature. But don&rsquo;t take off all your child&rsquo;s 
clothes, because she may become too cold and start shivering, which produces 
more body heat, causing the temperature to rise again. Sponging your child with 
tepid (lukewarm) water, alcohol baths and rubs are not recommended.</p> 
<h2>Contact your health care provider if your child:</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Has a fever and is less than 6 months old.</li> 
<li>Has a fever for more than 72 hours.</li> 
<li>Is excessively cranky, fussy or irritable.</li> 
<li>Is excessively sleepy, lethargic or does not respond.</li> 
<li>Is persistently wheezing or coughing.</li> 
<li>Has a fever and a rash or any other signs of illness that worry you.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Medication is not always needed to reduce a child&rsquo;s 
temperature.</strong></p> 
<p>In fact, the best reason for giving your child medicine is not to reduce the
fever but to relieve any aches and pains.</p> 
<p>Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol, Tempra, Panadol and others) is a suitable 
medication for a fever. Unless your doctor says otherwise, parents can give the 
dose recommended on the package every 4 hours until the child&rsquo;s 
temperature comes down. The temperature usually comes down in 1 hour and then 
rises again, in which case the medication may have to be repeated.<strong>Do 
not give more than 5 doses in 24 hours.</strong></p> 
<p>You can also use ibuprofen, which is found in products such as Advil and 
Motrin. Be sure to follow the directions on the package. Ibuprofen can be given 
every 6 to 8 hours &mdash; up to 4 times in a 24-hour period. Do not exceed the 
recommended dose.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well.
</li> 
<li>Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months without first talking to 
your doctor.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>A child or teenager with a fever should not be given aspirin 
[acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)]</h2> 
<p>If the fever is due to chickenpox, influenza or certain other viral 
infections, taking aspirin can increase the risk of Reye&rsquo;s syndrome. This 
is a very serious condition that can damage the liver and brain.</p>
