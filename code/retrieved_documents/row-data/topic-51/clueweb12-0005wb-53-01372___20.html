<p><b>Aspirin</b>, or <b>acetylsalicylic acid</b> (IPA: 
[&#601;&#712;s&#603;tl&#716;s&aelig;l&#601;&#712;s&#618;l&#618;k 
&#712;&aelig;s&#618;d]), (acetosal) is a drug in the family of salicylates, 
often used as ananalgesic (to relieve minor aches and pains), antipyretic (to 
reducefever), and as an anti-inflammatory. It also has an antiplatelet 
(&quot;blood-thinning&quot;) effect and is used in long-term, low doses to 
preventheart attacks and thrombus formation in hypercoaguable states (e.g.in 
cancer). </p> 
<p>Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of 
thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet 
aggregation. This anticoagulant property makes it useful for reducing the 
incidence of heart attacks. Aspirin produced for this purpose often comes in 75 
or 81mg, dispersible tablets and is sometimes called &quot;junior aspirin&quot; 
or &quot;baby aspirin.&quot; High doses of aspirin are also given immediately 
after an acute heart attack. These doses may also inhibit the synthesis of
prothrombin and may, therefore, produce a second and different anticoagulant 
effect, but this is not well understood.</p> 
<p>Its primary, undesirable side-effects, especially in higher doses, are 
gastrointestinal distress (including ulcers and stomach bleeding) and tinnitus. 
Another side-effect, due to its anticoagulant properties, is increased bleeding 
inmenstruating women. Because there appears to be a correlation between aspirin 
andReye's syndrome in children under the age of about 12, aspirin is no longer 
used to controlflu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox in minors.[1] 
</p> 
<p>Aspirin was the first-discovered member of the class of drugs known as 
non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), not all of which are 
salicylates, though they all have similar effects and a similar action 
mechanism.</p>

<h2> Aspirin as genericized trademark Edit</h2> 
<p>The brand name <i>Aspirin</i> was coined by the Bayer company of Germany. 
In some countries the name is used as ageneric term for the drug rather than 
the manufacturer'strademark. In countries in which Aspirin remains a trademark, 
theinitialism <b>ASA</b> (for <i>acetylsalicylic acid</i>) is used as a generic 
term.</p> 
<p>The name &quot;aspirin&quot; is composed of <i>a-</i> (from the acetyl group
)<i>-spir-</i> (from the plant genus <i>Spiraea</i>) and <i>-in</i> (a common 
ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated 
by another means. &quot;As&quot; referring to AcetylSalicylic and 
&quot;pir&quot; in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate 
it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally, &quot;in&quot; because it was 
a common ending for drugs at the time.</p> 
<p>On March 6, 1899, Bayer registered it as a trademark. However, the German 
company lost the right to use the trademark in many countries because theAllies 
seized and resold its foreign assets afterWorld War I. The right to use 
&quot;Aspirin&quot; in the United States (along with all other Bayer 
trademarks) was purchased from the U.S. government bySterling Drug in 1918. 
Even before thepatent for the drug expired in 1917, Bayer had been unable to 
stop competitors from copying the formula and using the name elsewhere, so, 
with a flooded market, the public was unable to recognize &quot;Aspirin&quot; 
as coming from only one manufacturer. Sterling was subsequently unable to 
prevent &quot;Aspirin&quot; from being ruled agenericized trademark in a U.S. 
federal court in 1921. Sterling was ultimately acquired by Bayer in 1994, but 
this did not restore the U.S. trademark. Other countries (such asCanada and 
many countries in Europe) still consider &quot;Aspirin&quot; a protected 
trademark.</p> 
<h2> History Edit</h2>  Acetylsalicylic acid crystals <br>
Added by PhloxBot 
<br> 
<h3>Salicylic acidEdit</h3> 
<p>Hippocrates, a Greek physician, wrote in the 5th century BC about a bitter 
powder extracted from [willow bark that could ease aches and pains and reduce 
fevers. This remedy is also mentioned in texts from ancient Sumer, Lebanon, and 
Assyria. The Cherokee and other Native Americans used an infusion of the bark 
for fever and other medicinal purposes for centuries.[2] The medicinal part of 
the plant is the inner bark and was used as a pain reliever for a variety of 
ailments. The Reverend Edward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, 
England, noted in 1763 that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a 
fever.[3] </p> 
<p>The active extract of the bark, called <i>salicin</i>, after the Latin name 
for the white willow (<i>Salix alba</i>), was isolated to its crystalline form 
in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italian 
chemist. Piria was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second 
component, which on oxidation becomes [[salicylic acid</p> 
<p>Salicylic acid was also isolated from the herb meadowsweet (<i>Filipendula 
ulmaria</i>, formerly classified as <i>Spiraea ulmaria</i>) by German 
researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused 
digestive problems such as gastric irritation and bleeding and diarrhea, and 
even death when consumed in high doses.</p> 
<h3>AspirinEdit</h3> 
<p>A French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt was first to prepare 
acetylsalicylic acid (future aspirin) in 1853. In the course of his work on the 
synthesis and properties of various acidanhydrides, he mixed acetyl chloride 
with asodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate). A vigorous reaction 
ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified.[4] Since no structural theory 
existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained 
&quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot; (wasserfreie 
Salicyls&auml;ure-Essigs&auml;ure). When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid 
in a diluted solution ofsodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium 
salts of salicylic and acetic acids.[4] This preparation of aspirin 
(&quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot;) was one of the many reactions Gerhardt 
conducted for his paper on anhydrides, and he did not pursue it further.</p> 
<p>Six years later in 1859 von Gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic 
acid (he called it &quot;acetylirte Salicyls&auml;ure&quot;) by a reaction of 
salicylic acid and acetyl chloride.[5] In 1869 Schr&ouml;der, Prinzhorn and 
Kraut (Prinzhorn is credited in the paper with conducting the experiments) 
repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from 
salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same 
compound--acetylsalicylic acid. They were first to assign to it the correct 
structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.[6] </p> 
<p>In 1897 Felix Hoffmann a chemist at Friedrich Bayer &amp; Co. obtained 
acetylsalicylic acid[7] by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride,[8]
 that is essentially repeating the Gilm/Kraut procedure but substituting acetic 
anhydride for acetyl chloride. This synthesis served as the basis for Bayer 
claims to discovery of aspirin. According to a legend publicized by Bayer, 
Hoffmann made some of the formula and gave it to his father, who was suffering 
from the pain of arthritis and could not stand the side-effects of salicylic 
acid.[7] Much later in 1949 another Bayer researcher Arthur Eichengr&uuml;n 
asserted his own priority as a discoverer of aspirin (see below for the details 
of Hoffmann-Eichengr&uuml;n controversy). This argument did much to obscure the 
real history of aspirin, whose origins is not the pharmaceutical industry but 
an earlier academic research. Despite the fact that pure aspirin was 
synthesized by von Gilm and by Kraut's group many years before Hoffmann (see 
above), Bayer continues to insist that &quot;The active ingredient in 
Aspirin&reg;, acetylsalicylic acid, was synthesized for the first time in a 
chemically pure and thus stable form in 1897 by a young chemist working for 
Bayer, Dr. Felix Hoffmann.&quot;[9] </p> 
<p>However, German patent office refused to grant Bayer patent for 
acetylsalicylic acid on the grounds that neither the product nor the process of 
preparation were novel.[7] In 1905 Bayer sued Chemische Fabrik von Heyden in 
Britain for infringing the British patent on aspirin granted to it in 1900. 
Hayden claimed that existingprior art, in particular Kraut's work invalidated 
Bayer's patent. Bayer advanced the argument that they were first to prepare 
pure form of aspirin. Judge agreed with Hayden and invalidated Bayer patent. 
Similar struggle took place in the Circuit court in Chicago; however, in the US 
the Bayer's patent was upheld in 1909.[7] This created a situation when aspirin 
in the US was three times more expensive than in Canada and ten times more 
expensive than in Europe, and resulted in rampant smuggling of aspirin, which 
Bayer unsuccessfully tried to contain.[7] </p> 
<p>Bayer began marketing aspirin in July 1899.[7] It was marketed alongside 
another of Hoffmann's products, an acetylated derivative ofmorphine called '
Heroin' that he invented 11 days after aspirin[How to reference and link to 
summary or text]. Heroin was initially the more successful of the two 
painkillers and it was common belief that it was healthier than aspirin. But, 
as heroin's shortcoming of addictiveness became more obvious, aspirin stepped 
to the forefront. Aspirin was originally sold as a powder (still the preferred 
form in many European countries) and was an instant success; in 1914, Bayer 
introduced aspirin tablets.</p>  Advertisement for Asprin, Heroin, Lycetol,

<p>Several claims to invention of acetylsalicylic acid have arisen. 
Acetylsalicylic acid was already being manufactured by the Chemische Fabrik von 
Heyden Company in 1897, although without a brand name[How to reference and link 
to summary or text]. A new pretender to the title of aspirin discoverer 
appeared in 1949.Arthur Eichengr&uuml;n who was 81 &quot;claimed that he had 
instructed Hoffmann to synthesise acetylsalicylic acid and that the latter had 
done so without knowing the purpose of the work&quot;.[10] In 2000, Walter 
Sneader ofUniversity of Strathclyde in Glasgow reexamined the case and 
concluded that &quot;Arthur Eichengr&uuml;n was telling the truth when he wrote 
that acetylsalicylic acid was synthesised under his direction and that the drug 
would not have been introduced in 1899 without his intervention&quot;.[10] 
Subsequently, in his polemic with Sneader, Axel Helmstaedter, General Secretary 
of International Society for the History of Pharmacy, noted that Sneader did 
not credit several earlier publications which discussed the 
Hoffmann-Eichengr&uuml;n controversy in detail, with most historians doubting 
Eichengr&uuml;n's account.[11] Bayer countered to Sneader in a press-release 
that according to the records, Hoffmann and Eichengr&uuml;n held equal 
positions, and Eichengr&uuml;n was not Hoffmann's supervisor. Hoffmann was 
named on the US Patent as the inventor, which Sneader did not mention. 
Eichengr&uuml;n who left Bayer in 1908 had multiple opportunities to claim the 
priority and had never before 1949 done it; neither he claimed or received any 
percentage of the profit from aspirin sales.[12] </p> 
<p>It was not until the 1970s that the mechanism of action of aspirin and 
similar drugs calledNSAIDs was elucidated (see below). </p> 
<h2> Synthesis of aspirin Edit</h2> 
<p>The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction, where 
the alcohol group from the salicylic acid reacts with an acid (acetyl 
anhydride) to form an ester. Aspirin is commercially synthesized using a 
two-step process. First,phenol (generally extracted from coal tar) is treated 
with a sodium base which generatessodium phenoxide, which is then reacted with 
carbon dioxide under high temperature and pressure to yield salicylate, which 
is acidified, yieldingsalicylic acid. This process is known as the 
Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. </p> 
<dl> 
<dd> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Salicylic acid is then acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin 
andacetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in 
undergraduate organic chemistry practicals, and generally tends to produce low 
yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. 
The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify withphosphoric acid and 
heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 to 60 
minutes.</p> 
<p>The original synthesis of aspirin from salicylic acid involved acetylation 
withacetyl chloride. Unfortunately, the byproduct from this is hydrochloric acid
, which is corrosive and environmentally hazardous. As described above, it was 
then later found that acetic anhydride was a better acylating agent, with the 
byproduct acetic acid formed, which does not have the unwanted properties of 
hydrochloric acid and can also be recycled. The salicylic acid/acetic anhydride 
method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.</p> 
<dl> 
<dd> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like 
vinegar. This is because aspirin can undergo autocatalytic degradation to 
salicylic acid in moist conditions, yielding salicylic acid andacetic acid. </p>
<p>The acid dissociation constant (pKa) for Acetylsalicylic acid is 3.5 at 
25&nbsp;&deg;C.[13] ASA, being a weak acid, dissociates as shown by the 
following reaction equation:</p> 
<dl> 
<dd> </dd> </dl> 
<h2> Mechanism of action Edit</h2> 
<p>In 1971, the British pharmacologist, John Robert Vane, who was then 
employed by theRoyal College of Surgeons in London, showed that aspirin had 
suppressed the production ofprostaglandins and thromboxanes.[14] For this piece 
of research he was awarded both aNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1982 
and aknighthood. </p> 
<p>Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and 
thromboxanes is due to its non-competitive and irreversible inhibition of the
cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and 
thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl 
group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX 
enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such asdiclofenac and 
ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. </p> 
<p>Prostaglandins are local hormones (paracrine) produced in the body and have 
diverse effects in the body, including but not limited to transmission of pain 
information to the brain, modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and 
inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation ofplatelets that 
formblood clots. Heart attacks are primarily caused by blood clots, and their 
reduction with the introduction of small amounts of aspirin has been seen to be 
an effective medical intervention. The side-effect of this is that the ability 
of the blood in general to clot is reduced, and excessive bleeding may result 
from the use of aspirin.</p>  3D model of chemical structure of aspirin <br>

Added byPhloxBot <br>

<p>There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 and COX-2. 
Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of 
COX-2. Normally COX-2 produces prostanoids, most of which are pro-inflammatory. 
Aspirin-modified COX-2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. 
Newer NSAID drugs calledCOX-2 selective inhibitors have been developed that 
inhibit only COX-2, with the hope for reduction of gastrointestinal 
side-effects.</p> 
<p>However, several of the new COX-2 selective inhibitors have been recently 
withdrawn, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of 
heart attack. It is proposed that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature 
in the body express COX-2, and, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandins 
(specifically PGI2; prostacyclin) are downregulated with respect to thromboxane 
levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective 
anti-coagulative effect of PGI2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus 
and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets 
have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX once aspirin has 
irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible 
inhibitors.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, aspirin has 2 additional modes of actions, contributing to its 
strong analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) 
mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier 
back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release 
protons. In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons. (Note: This 
effect in high doses of aspirin actually causes fever due to the heat released 
from the electron transport chain, instead of its normal antipyretic action.)
</li> 
<li> It induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body that enable the white 
blood cells (leukocytes) to fight infections more effectively. This has been 
found recently by Dr. Derek W. Gilroy, winning Bayer's International Aspirin 
Award 2005.[15] </li> </ul> 
<p>More recent data suggest that salicylic acid and its derivatives will 
modulate NF&kappa;B signaling.[How to reference and link to summary or text] 
NF&kappa;B is a transcription factor complex that plays a central role in many 
biological processes, including inflammation.</p> 
<h2> Indications Edit</h2> 
<p>Aspirin, as with many older drugs, has proven to be useful in many 
conditions. Despite its well-known toxicity it is widely used, since physicians 
are familiar with its properties. Indications for its use include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fever </li> 
<li> Pain (especially useful for some forms of arthritis, osteoid osteoma, and 
chronic pain)</li> 
<li> Migraine </li> 
<li> Rheumatic fever (drug of choice) </li> 
<li> Kawasaki disease (along with IVIG) </li> 
<li> Pericarditis </li> 
<li> Coronary artery disease </li> 
<li> Acute myocardial infarction[16] </li> </ul> 
<p>In addition, aspirin is recommended (low dose, 75-81 mg daily) for the 
prevention of:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Myocardial infarction &mdash; in patients with either documented coronary 
artery disease or at elevated risk ofcardiovascular disease. Women may possibly 
benefit less from aspirin than men.[17][18] </li> 
<li> Stroke &mdash; as secondary prevention (i.e. to prevent recurrence) </li> 
</ul> 
<h3> Dosage Edit</h3> 
<p>For adults doses of 300 to 1000 mg are generally taken four times a day for 
fever or arthritis, with a maximum dose of 8000 mg a day.[19] The correct dose 
of aspirin depends on the disease process that is being treated. For instance, 
for the treatment of rheumatic fever, doses near the maximal daily dose have 
been used historically. For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone 
with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, doses as low as 75 mg 
daily (or possibly even lower) are sufficient.</p> 
<p>For those under 12 years of age, the dose previously varied with the age, 
but aspirin is no longer routinely used in children due to the association with
Reye's syndrome; paracetamol or other NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen, are now being 
used instead.Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin 
use in children with aspirin initially started at 7.5-12.5 mg/kg body weight 
taken four times a day for up to two weeks and then continued at 5 mg/kg once 
daily for a further six to eight weeks.[20] </p> 
<h2> Dangers of low-dose aspirin Edit</h2> 
<p>A recent review states: &quot;....low-dose aspirin increases the risk of 
major bleeding 2-fold compared with placebo. However, the annual incidence of 
major bleeding due to low-dose aspirin is modest&mdash;only 1.3 patients per 
thousand higher than what is observed with placebo treatment. Treatment of 
approximately 800 patients with low-dose aspirin annually for cardiovascular 
prophylaxis will result in only 1 additional major bleeding episode.&quot; 
Further, &quot;...the cost to prevent one major GI bleeding episode from 
aspirin in 1 year by substituting clopidogrel therapy would be 
$1,216,180...&quot;[21] </p> 
<h2> Contraindications and warnings Edit</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> Aspirin should be avoided by those known to be allergic to ibuprofen or 
naproxen. </li> 
<li> Caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated 
bronchospasm. </li> 
<li> It is generally recommended that one seek medical help if symptoms do not 
improve after a few days of therapy.</li> 
<li> Caution should be taken in patients with kidney disease, peptic ulcers, 
milddiabetes, gout or gastritis; manufacturers recommend talking to one's 
doctor before using this medicine.</li> 
<li> Taking aspirin with alcohol increases the chance of gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage (stomach bleeding). </li> 
<li> Children, including teenagers, are discouraged from using aspirin in cold 
or flu symptoms as this has been linked withReye's syndrome.[1] </li> 
<li> Patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take 
salicylates.</li> 
<li> Some sources recommend that patients with hyperthyroidism avoid aspirin 
because it elevates T4 levels.[2] </li> </ul> 
<h2> Common side-effects Edit</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> Gastrointestinal complaints (stomach upset, dyspepsia, heartburn, small 
blood loss). To help avoid these problems, it is recommended that aspirin be 
taken at or after meals. Undetected blood loss may lead tohypochromic anemia. 
The Gastrointestinal complications that may result from a dose of Aspirin are 
due to Aspirin inhibitory action on Cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2.</li> 
<li> Severe gastrointestinal complaints (gross bleeding and/or ulceration), 
requiring discontinuation and immediate treatment. Patients receiving high 
doses and/or long-term treatment should receive gastric protection with 
high-dosed antacids,ranitidine or omeprazole. </li> 
<li> Frequently, central effects (dizziness, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, 
centrally mediated vision disturbances, and headaches). The higher the daily 
dose is, the more likely it is that central nervous system side-effects will 
occur.</li> 
<li> Sweating, seen with high doses, independent from antipyretic action </li> 
<li> Long-term treatment with high doses (arthritis and rheumatic fever): 
often increased liver enzymes without symptoms, rarely reversible liver damage. 
The potentially fatalReye's syndrome may occur, if given to pediatric patients 
with fever and other signs of infections. The syndrome is due to fatty 
degeneration of liver cells. Up to 30 percent of those afflicted will 
eventually die. Prompt hospital treatment may be life-saving.</li> 
<li> Chronic nephritis with long-term use, usually if used in combination with 
certain other painkillers. This condition may lead to chronic renal failure.
</li> 
<li> Prolonged and more severe bleeding after operations and post-traumatic 
for up to 10 days after the last aspirin dose. If one wishes to counteract the 
bleeding tendency, freshthrombocyte concentrate will usually work. </li> 
<li> Skin reactions, angioedema, and bronchospasm have all been seen 
infrequently.</li> 
<li> Patients that have the genetic disease known as Glucose-6-Phosphate 
Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) should avoid this drug as it is known to cause 
hemolytic anemia in large doses depending on the severity of the disease.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2> Interactions Edit</h2> 
<p>Aspirin can interact with some other drugs. Some drugs, for example those 
used fordiabetes, are bound by plasma protein in the blood supply and are 
therefore not free to react with their targets. However, aspirin may displace 
them from plasma protein, leading to a drugoverdose. Aspirin has this same 
effect onanticoagulants. </p> 
<h2> Overdose Edit</h2> 
<p>Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single 
large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, supratherapeutic doses are taken 
over a period of time. Acute overdose has amortality rate of 2%. Chronic 
overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose 
may be especially severe in children.[22] </p> 
<h3> Symptoms Edit</h3> 
<p>Aspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to 
significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with mild intoxication frequently 
havenausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, tinnitus, and dizziness. 
More significant symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include
hyperthermia, tachypnea, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia
,hypoglycemia, hallucinations, confusion, seizure, cerebral edema, and coma. 
The most common cause ofdeath following an aspirin overdose is cardiopulmonary 
arrest usually due topulmonary edema.[23] </p> 
<h3> Toxicity Edit</h3> 
<p>The toxic dose of aspirin is generally considered greater than 150 mg per 
kg of body mass. Moderate toxicity occurs at doses up to 300 mg/kg, severe 
toxicity occurs between 300 to 500 mg/kg, and a potentially lethal dose is 
greater than 500 mg/kg.[24] This is the equivalent of many dozens of the common 
325 mg tablets, depending on body weight. Note that children cannot tolerate as 
much aspirin per unit body weight as adults can, even when aspirin is 
indicated. Label-directions should be followed carefully.</p> 
<h3> Treatment Edit</h3> 
<p>All overdose patients must be taken to a hospital immediately. </p> 
<p>Initial treatment of an acute overdose includes gastric decontamination of 
the patient. This is achieved by administeringactivated charcoal which adsorbs 
the aspirin in thegastrointestinal tract. Stomach pumps are no longer routinely 
used in the treatment of poisonings but are sometimes considered if the patient 
has ingested a potentially lethal amount up to 1 hour previously.[25] Repeated 
doses of charcoal have been proposed to be beneficial in aspirin overdose.[26] 
A study performed found that repeat dose charcoal might not be of significant 
value.[27] However, most toxicologists will administer additional charcoal if 
serum salicylate levels are increasing.</p> 
<p>Patients are monitored until their peak salicylate blood level has been 
determined.[28] Blood levels are usually performed 4 hours after ingestion and 
then every 2 hours after that to determine the maximum level. Maximum levels 
can be used as a guide to toxic effects expected.[29] </p> 
<p>There is no antidote to salicylate poisoning. Frequent blood work is 
performed to checkmetabolic, salicylate, and blood sugar levels; arterial blood 
gas assessments are performed to test for respiratory alkalosis and metabolic 
acidosis. Patients are monitored and often treated according to their 
individual symptoms, patients may be givenintravenous potassium chloride to 
counteracthypokalemia, glucose to restore blood sugar levels, benzodiazepines 
for any seizure activity, fluids fordehydration, and importantly sodium 
bicarbonate to restore the blood's sensitive pH balance. Sodium bicarbonate 
also has the effect of increasing the pH of urine, which in turn increases the 
elimination of salicylate. Additionally,hemodialysis can be implemented to 
enhance the removal of salicylate from the blood. Hemodialysis is usually used 
in severely poisoned patients; for example, patients with significantly high 
salicylate blood levels, significant neurotoxicity (agitation, coma, 
convulsions), renal failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiovascular instability are 
hemodialyzed.[28] Hemodialysis also has the advantage of restoring electrolyte 
andacid-base abnormalities; hemodialysis is often life-saving in severely ill 
patients.</p> 
<p>If the overdose was intentional, the patient should undergo psychiatric 
evaluation, as with anysuicide attempt. </p> 
<h3> Epidemiology Edit</h3> 
<p>In the later part of the 20th century the number of salicylate poisonings 
has declined mainly due to the popularity of other over-the-counter analgesics 
such asparacetamol. Fifty-two deaths involving single-ingredient aspirin were 
reported in theUnited States in the year 2000. However, in all but three cases, 
the reason for the ingestion of lethal doses was intentional, predominantly 
suicides.[30] </p> 
<h2> Research into cancer prevention Edit</h2> 
<p>The role that aspirin might have in reducing the rates of certain cancers 
has been the subject of many studies. However, given the side-effects of NSAIDs 
on increased gastrointestinal bleeding and rates of heart disease, there is no 
current medical recommendation to use these drugs for cancer reduction.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Prostate</b> - While there is some epidemiological information 
suggesting a correlation between the reduction of prostate cancer and aspirin 
use, two recent studies (a multicentric case-control study and epidemiological 
study) were inconclusive.[31][32] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Colon</b> - A 2005 JAMA article states that aspirin may prevent 
carcinoma of the colon, when taken in at least twice-daily adult (325 mg) doses.
[33] It follows an earlier study, also using the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) 
women, which had similar conclusions but with a smaller testing population.[34] 
The conclusion of the JAMA study was that both aspirin and other non-aspirin 
NSAIDs used over a long time (best results seen after at least a decade of 
regular use) reduce risk of colorectal cancer. The risk was reduced the most at 
doses higher than 14 tablets per week (full-strength aspirin twice a day). 
However, these doses can have a higher incidence of serious gastrointestinal 
bleeding, and reduced doses (even the low doses recommended for cardiovascular 
health (81 mg/day)) also seem to have an anti-cancer effect, albeit not as much 
as the higher doses. The results of these studies have been correlated with 
experimental studies in human volunteers and in rodents. At least four clinical 
trials show that small doses of aspirin reduce, modestly, intestinal polyps 
recurrence in patients with some history of adenomas.[35] Some twenty 
carcinogenesis studies in rats or mice also support that aspirin can prevent 
cancer, also reported in theChemoprevention of Colorectal Cancer Database. </li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Gall bladder</b> - There is some evidence that aspirin may increase 
gall bladder motility and thus be effective in treating gall bladder disease.[
How to reference and link to summary or text] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Pancreatic</b> - A study in 2004 showed that increases in dose and 
duration of aspirin may<i>significantly increase</i> the risk of pancreatic 
cancer in women (only women were in the study); however this did not seem to 
affect current, regular users.[36] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Upper GI tract</b> - A study published in 2003 reported that people who 
had been taking aspirin regularly for 5 or more years seemed to have a 
two-thirds less risk of mouth, throat and esophageal cancer than non-users.[37] 
This study was done on both cancer patients and other people in hospital for 
various reasons, and was done by comprehensive epidemiological questionnaires 
of life habits rather than empirical testing.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Lung</b> - A 20-year study published in 2002 showed that in a group of 
14,000 women in New York City, regular aspirin use (defined as at least once a 
week, various doses) reduced their risk of lung cancer, especially small-cell 
carcinoma.[38] This may be because many lung tumors have high amounts of COX-2 
enzymes expressed in them, especially in adenocarcinomas and tumors caused by
asbestosis.[39] Aspirin is a known blocker of both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, 
although this study suggests that if the COX-2 link is direct, other COX-2 
inhibitors may also play a similar role.<br>
Another study in 2002 of both men 
and women found that risk reduction was more significant in males than females; 
overall, the effects of smoking were far more influential than aspirin use in 
determining cancer risks.[40] Of those who smoked, those who smoked the least 
got the most benefit from aspirin use. Some of the heaviest smokers saw no 
benefit from aspirin at all.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Aspirin in petsEdit</h2> 
<p>Aspirin may be used in cats, but only under a veterinarian's strict 
supervision, as aspirin has a biological half-life of 3 days in cats (cats have 
trouble breaking down aspirin). Dogs may also use aspirin under a vet's strict 
supervision, though dogs are more susceptible to aspirin-caused GI bleeds than 
humans. Aspirin is generally not recommended for pets, though, as there are 
much safer alternatives for pain relief, and aspirin interacts with several 
other drugs includingcortisones, digoxin, some antibiotics, phenobarbital and 
furosemide (Lasix).[41] </p>
