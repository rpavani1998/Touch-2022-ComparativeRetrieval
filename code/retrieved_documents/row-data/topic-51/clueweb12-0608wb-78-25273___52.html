 Highlights 
<p><strong>Drug Warning</strong></p> 
<p>In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned that mycophenolate 
mofetil (CellCept, Myfortic) should not be used during pregnancy as it can 
cause miscarriages and birth defects.</p> 
<p><strong>Systematic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Overview</strong></p> 
<p>SLE is an autoimmune disease that causes a chronic inflammatory condition. 
The inflammation triggered by SLE affects many organs in the body, including 
skin, joints, kidneys, lung, and nervous system. Women, especially 
African-American and Asian women, are at highest risk for developing SLE.</p> 
<p><strong>Symptoms and Diagnosis</strong></p> 
<p>Not all patients with SLE experience the same symptoms. The most common 
symptoms are joint pain, skin rash, and fever. Symptoms can develop slowly or 
appear suddenly. Many patients with SLE have 'flares,' in which symptoms 
suddenly worsen and then disappear for long periods of time. Diagnosing SLE is 
complicated because symptoms vary widely and can resemble other conditions. A 
doctor will base an SLE diagnosis on certain specific criteria including 
symptom history and the results of blood tests for antinuclear antibodies.</p> 
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p> 
<p>No drug can cure SLE, but many different drugs can help control symptoms 
and relieve discomfort. The choice of drugs depends on the severity of the 
condition as well as other factors. Patients with mild SLE may be helped by 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) while patients with more severe 
SLE may require corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. Researchers are working 
to develop new drugs and treatments for SLE.</p> 
<p><strong>Living with SLE</strong></p> 
<p>Patients can make lifestyle changes to help cope with SLE. These include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid excessive sunlight exposure, and wear sunscreen (ultraviolet light 
is the one of the main triggers of flares).</li> 
<li>Get plenty of rest (fatigue is another common SLE symptom).</li> 
<li>Engage in regular light-to-moderate exercise to help fight fatigue and 
heart disease, and to keep joints flexible.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Introduction 
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, often life-long, 
autoimmune disease. It can be mild to severe, and&nbsp;affects mostly women. 
SLE may affect various parts of the body, but it most often manifests in the 
skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. SLE was first described in 1828. Its very 
name helps define the disease:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Systemic</i> is used because the disease can affect organs and tissue 
throughout the body.</li> 
<li><i>Lupus</i> is Latin for wolf. It refers to the rash that extends across 
the bridge of the nose and upper cheekbones and was thought to resemble a wolf 
bite.</li> 
<li><i>Erythematosus</i> is from the Greek word for red and refers to the 
color of the rash.</li> </ul> 
<p>Lupus has many different symptoms. Common ones include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fatigue</li> 
<li>Joint pain or swelling</li> 
<li>Skin rashes</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex disorder that most likely results 
from a combination of processes and factors.</p> 
<p>Environmental factors, such as viruses, exposure to chemicals, or sunlight, 
trigger inflammatory or immune activity. This immune activation may begin as an 
appropriate response to an unwanted &quot;invader.&quot; But, because of a 
combination of genetic factors, an individual with lupus develops an ongoing 
immune response that does not shut itself off appropriately. This leads to 
waxing and waning flares of inflammation that can involve various organs of the 
body, depending on specific features of this self-perpetuating immune response 
in individual patients.</p> 
<p>The exact combination of genes that predispose individuals to SLE may 
differ somewhat from patient to patient, but probably share certain common 
features which tend to impair the ability of the body to get rid of 
immune-triggering particles and which tend to prolong or increase the degree of 
immune responsiveness to these triggers.</p> 
<p>A major characteristic of lupus is that it is an autoimmune response in 
which immune factors, called autoantibodies, attack the person's own cells. 
Some autoantibodies are normal in a well-balanced immune system, and serve 
various roles to help the body dispose of wastes, protect from infectious 
invaders, and to keep blood vessels clear. In healthy people, autoantibodies 
tend to be well-regulated and well &quot;masked,&quot; or covered up, until 
needed. Therefore, it is probably the high activity and high detestability of 
autoantibodies that makes lupus unique, not the fact that they exist.</p> 
<h3>The Inflammatory Process and Autoimmunity</h3> 
<p><i>The Normal Immune System Response.</i> The inflammatory process is a 
byproduct of the activity of the body's immune system, which fights infection 
and heals wounds and injuries:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When an injury or an infection occurs, white blood cells are mobilized to 
rid the body of any foreign proteins, such as a virus.</li> 
<li>The masses of blood cells that gather at the injured or infected site 
produce factors to fight any infections.</li> 
<li>In the process, the surrounding area becomes inflamed and some healthy 
tissue is injured. The immune system is then called upon to repair wounds by 
clotting any bleeding blood vessels and initiating fiber-like patches to the 
tissue.</li> 
<li>Under normal conditions, the immune system has special factors that 
control and limit this inflammatory process.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>The Infection Fighters.</i> B cells and T cells are two important 
components of the immune system that play a role in the inflammation associated 
with lupus. Both B cells and T cells belong to a family of immune cells called 
lymphocytes. Lymphocytes help fight infection.</p> 
<p>B cells and T cells are involved in the immune system's response to 
infection. Antigens are foreign bodies (such as bacteria and viruses) that 
stimulate the immune system to produce autoantibodies. When a T cell recognizes 
an antigen it will produce chemicals (cytokines) that cause B cells to multiply 
and release many immune proteins (antibodies). These antibodies circulate 
widely in the bloodstream, recognizing the foreign particles and triggering 
inflammation in order to rid the body of the invasion.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>For reasons that are still not completely understood, both the T cells and 
B cells become overactive in lupus patients. In lupus, a complex interaction 
between activated immune cells and an impaired antigen-elimination process 
leads to a greater than normal range of what the antibodies recognize. 
Eventually, antibodies are made that recognize more of the body's own tissues 
in a stronger or more persistent manner than is healthy, and inflammatory 
responses are mounted in these tissues.</p> 
<p><i>Autoantibodies</i>. In the majority of patients with SLE, antinuclear 
antibodies (ANA) are detectable. Such autoantibodies may be present in 
individuals up to 7 years prior to their developing symptoms of lupus. Some 
subtypes of ANA are found in lupus patients and only rarely in people without 
lupus. These include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anti-ds DNA. An autoantibody called anti-double stranded DNA (anti-ds DNA) 
may play an important role in some lupus patients.</li> 
<li>Anti-Sm antibodies. This antibody is found most often in lupus patients of 
African descent and is almost never detected in people without lupus.</li> 
<li>Anti-Ro (SSA) and Anti-La (SSB)</li> 
<li>Antiphospholipid antibodies</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Cytokines.</i> Most immune cells secrete or stimulate the production of 
powerful immune factors called cytokines. In small amounts, cytokines are 
indispensable for maintaining the balance of the body during immune responses, 
including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Infections</li> 
<li>Injuries</li> 
<li>Tissue repair</li> 
<li>Blood clotting</li> 
<li>Clearing of debris from inflamed blood vessels</li> 
<li>Other aspects of healing.</li> </ul> 
<p>If overproduced, however, they can cause serious damage, including 
dangerous levels of inflammation and cellular injury. Specific cytokines called 
interferons and interleukins play a critical role in SLE by regulating the 
secretion of autoantibodies by B cells.</p> 
<p><i>Complement.</i> Another immune factor of high interest in SLE is the 
complement system. This is comprised of more than 30 proteins and is important 
for defending and regulating the immune response. Inherited deficiencies in 
certain complement components (C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, and C2) have long been 
associated with SLE.</p> 
<h3>Genetic Factors</h3> 
<p>SLE is a complex disorder and researchers are still in the early stages of 
unraveling how genetic factors may alter and affect the immune system. 
Researchers estimate that 20 - 100 different genetic factors may make a person 
susceptible to SLE.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>The number of people diagnosed with lupus has more than tripled over the 
past four decades. This may simply indicate a greater degree of doctor training 
in recognizing the syndrome.</p> 
<h3>Gender</h3> 
<p>About 90% of lupus patients are women, most diagnosed when they are in 
their childbearing ages. Hormones may be an explanation. After menopause, women 
are only 2.5 times as likely as men to contract SLE. Flares also become 
somewhat less common after menopause in women who have chronic SLE.</p> 
<h3>Ethnicity</h3> 
<p>African-Americans are three to four times more likely to develop the 
disease than Caucasians and to have severe complications. Hispanics and Asians 
are also more susceptible to the disease.</p> 
<h3>Family History</h3> 
<p>A family history plays a strong role in SLE. A brother or sister of a 
patient with the disorder has 20 times the risk as someone without an immediate 
family member with SLE.</p> 
<h3>Risk Factors in Children</h3> 
<p>The disease is rare in childhood. When it does occur, it is often 
associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, a condition resulting from 
abnormally low levels of blood platelets. SLE in children may also be caused by 
certain medications, including minocycline and zafirlukast.</p> 
<h3>Presence of Other Autoimmune Disorders</h3> 
<p><i>Rheumatoid Arthritis.</i> Studies have investigated the relationship 
among hormones, SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis, another autoimmune disease. 
Higher levels of estrogen are associated with SLE, while<i>lower</i> levels are 
associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Some research suggests that some 
patients, in fact, progress from one disease to the other, and that such 
transitions occur during major hormonal shifts, such as the onset of menopause 
or pregnancy.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Drug-Induced Lupus</h3> 
<p>Many prescription drugs can cause lupus-like skin symptoms. These include 
high blood pressure (hypertension) medications, including hydrochlorothiazide, 
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers. About 
40 different drugs have been linked to lupus onset. Anyone diagnosed with 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus should be sure to tell their doctors all the 
medications (including herbs and supplements) that they are taking.</p> 
<h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3> 
<p><i>Smoking.</i> Smoking may be a risk factor for triggering SLE and can 
increase the risk for skin and kidney problems in women who have the disease.
</p> 
<h3>Possible SLE Triggers</h3> 
<p>In genetically susceptible people, there are various external factors that 
can provoke an immune response. Possible SLE triggers include colds, fatigue, 
stress, chemicals, sunlight, and certain drugs.</p> 
<p><i>Viruses.</i> Patients with SLE may be more likely to have been exposed 
to certain viruses than the general population. These viruses include the 
Epstein-Barr virus (the cause of mononucleosis), cytomegalovirus, and 
parvovirus-B1. In particular, some research suggests a strong association 
between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and increased risk of lupus, particularly for 
African-Americans.</p> 
<p><i>Sunlight.</i> Ultraviolet (UV) rays found in sunlight are important SLE 
triggers. When they bombard the skin, they can alter the structure of DNA in 
cells below the surface. The immune system may perceive these altered skin 
cells as foreign and trigger an autoimmune response against them. UV light is 
categorized as UVB or UVA depending on the length of the wave. Shorter UVB 
wavelengths cause the most harm.</p> 
<p><i>Chemicals.</i> Clusters of SLE cases have occurred in populations with 
high exposure to certain chemicals. Chlorinated pesticides and crystalline 
silica are two suspects. A number of other chemicals are under investigation. 
However, it is very difficult to determine a causal role for any specific 
chemicals. (Silicone breast implants have been under intense scrutiny as a 
possible trigger of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The weight of evidence 
to date, however, finds no support for this concern.) Some drugs have been 
associated with a temporary lupus syndrome (drug-induced lupus), which resolves 
when these drugs are stopped.</p> 
<p><i>Hormones.</i> Cytokines, major immune factors that are active in SLE, 
are directly affected by sex hormones. In general, estrogen enhances antibody 
production, and testosterone reduces antibody production, although their exact 
role in SLE may be more complicated than that since there are various ways in 
which each hormone might influence various immune cells. Women with SLE may 
have lower levels of several active male hormones (androgens), and some men who 
are affected by SLE may also have abnormal androgen levels.</p> 
<p>Premature menopause, and its accompanying symptoms (such as hot flashes), 
is common in women with SLE. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is used 
to relieve these symptoms, increases the risk for blood clots and heart 
problems. It is not clear whether HRT triggers SLE flares. Women should discuss 
with their doctors whether HRT is an appropriate and safe choice. Guidelines 
recommend that women who take HRT use the lowest possible dose for the shortest 
possible time. Women with SLE who have active disease, antiphospholipid 
antibodies, or a history of blood clots or heart disease should not use HRT.</p>
<p><em>Oral Contraceptives</em>. Female patients with lupus used to be 
cautioned against taking oral contraceptives (OCs) due to the possibility that 
estrogen could trigger lupus flare-ups. However, recent evidence indicates that 
OCs are safe, at least for women with inactive or stable lupus. Women who have 
been newly diagnosed with lupus should avoid OCs. Lupus can cause complications 
in its early stages. For this reason, women should wait until the disease 
reaches a stable state before taking OCs. In addition, women who have a history 
of, or who are at high risk for, blood clots (particularly women with 
antiphospholipid syndrome) should not use OCs. The estrogen in OCs increases 
the risk for blood clots.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Symptoms 
<p>SLE symptoms may develop slowly over months or years, or they may appear 
suddenly. Symptoms tend to be worse during winter months, perhaps because 
prolonged exposure to sunlight in the summer causes a gradual build-up of 
factors that trigger symptoms months later.</p> 
<h3>Arthritic Pain</h3> 
<p>The most common symptom is joint pain, which occurs in about 90% of 
patients with SLE. Characteristics of this symptom vary widely:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It is often accompanied by swelling and redness.</li> 
<li>It can last from hours to months.</li> 
<li>It may be mild or severe.</li> 
<li>It can occur in one joint, move from one to another, or flare erratically.
</li> 
<li>Pain often occurs in the morning and improves during the day, only to 
return later when the patient tires.</li> 
<li>The joints most affected are fingers, wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. 
(Joints in the spine and neck are not affected.)</li> </ul> 
<p>Children may experience these symptoms as growing pains, and, in all 
patients, they may be the only symptoms for many years.</p> 
<h3>Fever</h3> 
<p>Fever occurs in 90% of patients with SLE and is usually caused by the 
inflammatory process of the disease, not by infection. It is low-grade except 
during an acute lupus crisis.</p> 
<h3>Skin Rashes</h3> 
<p>Three-quarters of patients with SLE have skin inflammation and skin lesions 
(ulcers, rashes, or other injured areas). About half of these lesions are 
photosensitive; that is, they are aggravated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from 
sunlight, even from light coming through a window. (UV radiation may even 
trigger systemic flares in patients with SLE.)</p> 
<p>A number of different skin conditions have been described in patients with 
SLE.</p> 
<p><i>Discoid Lupus Erythematosus.</i> About 20% of patients have <i>discoid
</i> lesions. In such cases, the condition is often known as discoid lupus 
erythematosus (DLE). Patients with this condition may have the following skin 
abnormalities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Discoid means coin-shaped, so these lesions are round and raised. They are 
also scaly. Untreated, the margins gradually extend outward as the center dries 
out and shrivels, causing severe scarring. If discoid lesions appear on the 
scalp, they can plug hair follicles and cause irreversible hair loss. Discoid 
lesions can also appear on the upper body.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>A butterfly-shaped rash across the face may accompany this condition. This 
rash causes little scarring, although spidery, branching lines of swollen 
capillaries (the tiniest blood vessels) may appear.</li> </ul> Click the icon 
to see an image of systemic lupus erythematosus. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Most patients with this condition have only a limited skin disorder. In 
only about 10% of cases does discoid lupus develop into full-blown SLE.</p> 
<p><i>Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus.</i> Subacute cutaneous lupus 
erythematosus (SCLE) can cause skin lesions on parts of the body that are 
exposed to sunlight. These lesions do not cause scarring.</p> 
<p><em>Vasculitis</em>. Patients with SLE sometimes develop inflammation in 
the blood vessels (vasculitis) that may have the following effects on the skin:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Red welts may form across large areas of the body.</li> 
<li>Sometimes deep red bumps may appear, particularly on the leg, where they 
may ulcerate.</li> 
<li>In some people, reddish-purple lesions appear on the pads of fingers and 
toes or near the nails of fingers and toes.</li> 
<li>Lesions caused by vasculitis may ulcerate or blister if they erupt on 
mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or vagina and can be painful if they occur 
on the throat.</li> 
<li>Vasulitis can attack blood vessels in almost any other organ, including 
the brain, the heart, and the gastrointestinal tract.</li> </ul> Click the icon 
to see an image of vasculitis. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Other SLE Symptoms</h3> 
<p>Other symptoms include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fatigue</li> 
<li>Loss of appetite, nausea, and weight loss</li> 
<li>Chest pain</li> 
<li>Bruising</li> 
<li>Menstrual irregularities</li> 
<li>Thought and concentration disturbances</li> 
<li>Personality changes</li> 
<li>Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea</li> 
<li>Dryness of the eyes and mouth</li> 
<li>Brittle hair or hair loss</li> </ul> 
<p>Hair loss or breakage may also occur in about half of patients with SLE 
during severe flares or after pregnancy or severe illness. In such cases, hair 
grows back.</p> 
<h3>Raynaud's Phenomenon</h3> 
<p>Raynaud's phenomenon is a condition in which cold or stress can cause 
spasms in impaired blood vessels, resulting in pain in fingers and toes. It 
occurs as part of the inflammatory response in blood vessels, which can narrow 
them and reduce circulation. In extreme cases, gangrene can result.</p> Click 
the icon to see an image of Raynaud's phenomenon. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Conditions with Similar Symptoms</h3> 
<p>A number of conditions overlap with SLE:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Scleroderma: Hardening of the skin caused by overproduction of collagen
</li> 
<li>Rheumatoid arthritis: Inflammation of the lining of the joints</li> 
<li>Sj&ouml;gren syndrome: Characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth</li> 
<li>Mixed connective tissue disorder: Similar to SLE, but milder</li> 
<li>Myositis: Inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissues</li> 
<li>Rosacea: Flushed face with pus-filled blisters</li> 
<li>Seborrheic dermatitis: Sores on lips and nose</li> 
<li>Lichen planus: Swollen rash that itches, typically on scalp, arms, legs, 
or in the mouth</li> 
<li>Dermatomyositis: Bluish-red skin eruptions on face and upper body</li> 
<li>Lyme disease: Bulls-eye rash, joint inflammation, and flu-like symptoms
</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Complications 
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause systemic complications 
throughout the body.</p> 
<h3>Complications of the Blood</h3> 
<p>Almost 85% of patients with SLE experience problems associated with 
abnormalities in the blood.</p> 
<p><i>Anemia.</i> About half of patients with SLE are anemic. Causes include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Iron deficiencies resulting from excessive menstruation</li> 
<li>Iron deficiencies from gastro-intestinal bleeding caused by some of the 
treatments</li> 
<li>A specific anemia called <i>hemolytic anemia</i>, which destroys red blood 
cells</li> 
<li>Anemia of chronic disease</li> </ul> 
<p>Hemolytic anemia can occur with very high levels of the anticardiolipin 
antibody. It can be chronic or develop suddenly and be severely (acute).</p> 
<p><i>Antiphospholipid Syndrome.</i> Between 34 - 42% of patients with SLE 
have antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This is a specific set of conditions 
related to the presence of autoantibodies called<i>lupus anticoagulant</i> and 
<i>anticardiolipin</i>. These autoantibodies react against fatty molecules 
called phospholipids, and so are called antiphospholipids. Their actions have 
complex effects that include causing narrowing and abnormalities of blood 
vessels.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients who have APS have a very incidence of blood clots, which most 
often occur in the deep veins in the legs. Blood clotting, in turn, puts 
patients at higher risk for stroke and pulmonary embolism (clots in the lungs).
</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>The effects on blood vessels have also been associated with confusion, 
headaches, and seizures. Leg ulcers can also develop.</li> 
<li>Patients with APS who become pregnant have a high incidence of pregnancy 
loss, especially in the late term.</li> </ul> 
<p>Not all patients with APS carry both of the autoantibodies, and they can 
also wax and wane and so have varying effects. APS also occurs<i>without</i> 
lupus in about half of patients with the syndrome.</p> 
<p><i>Thrombocytopenia.</i> In thrombocytopenia, antibodies attack and destroy 
blood platelets. In such cases, blood clotting is impaired, which causes 
bruising and bleeding from the skin, nose, gums, or intestines. (This condition 
can also occur in APS, but it is not considered to be one of the standard 
features of the syndrome.)</p> 
<p><i>Neutropenia.</i> Neutropenia is a drop in the number of white blood 
cells. Patients with SLE often neutropenia, but the condition is usually 
harmless unless the reductions are so severe that they leave the patient 
vulnerable to infections.</p> 
<p><i>Acute Lupus Hemophagocyte Syndrome.</i> A rare blood complication of SLE 
that occurs primarily in Asians is called acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome. 
It is generally of short duration and characterized by fever and a sudden drop 
in blood cells and platelets.</p> 
<p><em>Lymphomas</em>. Patients with SLE and other autoimmune disorders have a 
greater risk for developing lymph system cancers such as Hodgkin's disease and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).</p> 
<h3>Heart and Circulation Complications</h3> 
<p>Heart disease is a primary cause of death in lupus patients. The immune 
response in SLE can cause chronic inflammation and other damaging effects that 
can cause significant injury to the arteries and tissues associated with the 
circulation and the heart. In addition, SLE treatments (particularly 
corticosteroids) affect cholesterol, weight, and other factors that can also 
affect the heart.</p> 
<p>Patients with SLE, have a higher risk for developing the following 
conditions, which put them at risk for heart attack or stroke:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in the arteries</li> 
<li>Increased stiffness in the arteries</li> 
<li>Unhealthy cholesterol and lipid (fatty molecules) levels</li> 
<li>High blood pressure, most likely because of kidney injury and 
corticosteroid treatments</li> 
<li>Heart failure</li> 
<li>Pericarditis, an inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart</li> 
<li>Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle itself (rare)</li> </ul>

<li>Abnormalities in the valves of the heart (rare)</li> 
<li>Blood clots</li> </ul> 
<p>The risk for cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke is much 
higher than average in younger women with SLE. The risks decline as such women 
age.</p> 
<h3>Lung Complications</h3> 
<p>SLE affects the lungs in about 60% of patients:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inflammation of the membrane lining the lung (<i>pleurisy</i>) is the most 
common problem, which can cause shortness of breath and coughing.</li> 
<li>In some cases, fluid accumulates, a condition called <i>pleural effusio</i>
n.</li> 
<li>Inflammation of the lung tissue itself is called <i>lupus pneumonitis</i>. 
It can be caused by infections or by the SLE inflammatory process. Symptoms are 
the same in both cases: fever, chest pain, labored breathing, and coughing. 
Rarely, lupus pneumonitis becomes chronic and causes scarring in the lungs, 
which reduces their ability to deliver oxygen to the blood.</li> 
<li>A very serious and rare condition called <em>pulmonary hypertension</em> 
occurs when high pressure develops as a result of damage to the blood vessels 
of the lungs.</li> </ul> Click the icon to see an image of primary pulmonary 
hypertension. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Kidney Complications (Lupus Nephritis)</h3> 
<p>The kidneys are a crucial battleground in SLE because it is here that the 
debris left over from the immune attacks is most likely to be deposited. Also, 
the immune response can also attack different parts of the kidney causing 
damage. About 50% of patients with SLE exhibit inflammation of the kidneys 
(called<em>lupus nephritis</em>).This condition occurs in different forms and 
can vary from mild to severe. Poor kidney function and kidney failure may 
result from this damage.</p> Click the icon to see an image of the kidney. <br>

<br> <br>

<p>Serious complications occur eventually in about 30% of patients. If kidney 
injury develops, it almost always occurs within 10 years of the onset of SLE, 
rarely after that.</p> 
<h3>Central Nervous System Complications</h3> 
<p>Nearly all patients with SLE report some symptoms relating to problems that 
occur in the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the spinal cord and 
the brain. CNS involvement is more likely to occur in the first year, usually 
during flare-ups in other organs.</p> 
<p>Symptoms vary widely and overlap with psychiatric or neurologic disorders. 
They may also be caused by of some medications used for SLE. Central nervous 
system symptoms are usually mild, but there is little effective treatment 
available for them. CNS symptoms get worse as the disease progresses.</p> 
<p>The most serious CNS disorder is inflammation of the blood vessels in the 
brain (vasculitis), which occurs in 10% of patients with SLE. Fever, seizures, 
psychosis, and even coma can occur. Other CNS side effects include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Irritability</li> 
<li>Emotional disorders (anxiety, depression)</li> 
<li>Mild impairment of concentration and memory</li> 
<li>Migraine and tension headaches</li> 
<li>Problems with the reflex systems, sensation, vision, hearing, and motor 
control</li> </ul> 
<h3>Infections</h3> 
<p>Infections are a common complication and a major cause of death in all 
stages of SLE. The immune system is indeed overactive in SLE, but it is also 
abnormal and reduces the ability to fight infections. Patients are not only 
prone to the ordinary streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, but they are 
also susceptible to fungal and parasitic infections (called opportunistic 
infections), which are common in people with weakened immune systems. They also 
face an increased risk for urinary tract, herpes, salmonella, and yeast 
infections. Corticosteroid and immunosuppressants, treatments used for SLE, 
also increase the risk for infections, thereby compounding the problem.</p> 
<h3>Gastrointestinal Complications</h3> 
<p>About 45% of patients with SLE suffer gastrointestinal problems, including 
nausea, weight loss, mild abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Severe inflammation of 
the intestinal tract occurs in less than 5% of patients and causes acute 
cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, and, rarely, intestinal perforation, which can be 
life-threatening. Fluid retention and swelling can cause intestinal 
obstruction, which is much less serious but causes the same type of severe 
pain. Inflammation of the pancreas can be caused by the disease and by 
corticosteroid therapy.</p> 
<h3>Joint, Muscle, and Bone Complications</h3> 
<p>Arthritis caused by SLE almost never leads to destruction or deformity of 
joints. The inflammatory process can, however, damage muscles and cause 
weakness. Patients with SLE also commonly experience reductions in bone mass 
density (osteoporosis) and have a higher risk for fractures, whether or not 
they are taking corticosteroids (which can increase the risk for osteoporosis). 
Women who have SLE should have regular bone mineral density scans to monitor 
bone health.</p> Click the icon to see an image of osteoporosis. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Eye Complications</h3> 
<p>Inflamed blood vessels in the eye can reduce blood supply to the retina, 
resulting in degeneration of nerve cells and a risk of hemorrhage in the 
retina. The most common symptoms are cotton-wool-like spots on the retina. In 
about 5% of patients sudden temporary blindness may occur.</p> 
<h3>Socioeconomic Consequences</h3> 
<p>In one study, 40% of patients with SLE quit work within 4 years of 
diagnosis, and many had to modify their work conditions. Significant factors 
that predicted job loss included high physical demands from the work itself, a 
more severe condition at the time of diagnosis, and lower educational levels. 
People with lower income jobs were at particular risk for leaving them.</p> 
<h3>Pregnancy and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3> 
<p>Women with lupus who conceive face high-risk pregnancies that increase the 
risks for themselves and their babies. It is important for women to understand 
the potential complications and plan accordingly. The most important advice is 
to avoid becoming pregnant when lupus is active.</p> 
<p>Research suggests that the following factors predict a successful pregnancy:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Disease state at time of conception</em>. Doctors strongly recommend 
that women wait to conceive until their disease state has been inactive for at 
least 6 months.</li> 
<li><em>Kidney (renal) function</em>. Women should make sure that their kidney 
function is evaluated prior to conception. Poor kidney function can worsen high 
blood pressure and cause excess protein in the urine. These complications 
increase the risk for preeclampsia and miscarriage.</li> 
<li><em>Lupus-related antibodies</em>. Antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin 
antibodies can increase the risks for preeclampsia, miscarriage, and 
stillbirths. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies can increase the risk for 
neonatal lupus erythematosus, a condition that can cause skin rash and liver 
and heart damage to the newborn baby. Levels of these antibodies should be 
tested at the start of pregnancy. Certain medications (aspirin, heparin) and 
tests (fetal heart monitoring) may be needed to ensure a safe pregnancy.</li> 
<li><em>Medication use during pregnancy</em>. Women with active disease may 
need to take low-dose corticosteroids, but women with inactive disease should 
avoid these drugs. Steroids appear to pose a low risk for birth defects, but 
can increase a pregnant woman's risks for gestational diabetes, high blood 
pressure, infection, and osteoporosis. For patients who need immunosuppressive 
therapy, azathioprine (Imuran) is an option. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) and 
cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) should not be taken during pregnancy.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Pregnancy Risks</strong></p> 
<p>Women with lupus are 20 times more likely to die during pregnancy than 
women without the disease. The risk for maternal death is due to the following 
serious conditions that can develop during pregnancy:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Miscarriages.</em> About 25% of lupus pregnancies result in 
miscarriage. The risk is highest for patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, 
active kidney disease, or high blood pressure<em>.</em></li> 
<li><em>Blood clots</em>. Women with lupus have a 6 times greater risk for 
developing deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) than women without the disease.
</li> 
<li><em>Clotting complications</em>. Low blood platelet count and anemia are 
also risks. Women with lupus are 3 times more likely to need a transfusion 
during pregnancy than women without lupus.</li> 
<li><em>Infections</em>. Blood infections (sepsis), pneumonia, and urinary 
tract infections are more common in pregnant women with lupus.</li> 
<li><em>Preeclampsia</em>. Women with lupus are three times more likely than 
healthy women to develop preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure), 
which can be potentially life threatening.</li> 
<li><em>Birth Complications</em>. Women with SLE have an increased risk of 
having a pre-term birth, stillbirth, or Caesarean section.</li> </ul> 
<p>Despite these obstacles, many women with lupus have healthy pregnancies and 
deliver healthy babies. To increase the odds of a successful pregnancy, it is 
important for women to plan carefully before becoming pregnant. Be sure to find 
knowledgeable doctors with whom you can communicate and trust. Pregnant women 
with lupus should try to assemble an interdisciplinary health care team that 
includes a rheumatologist, high-risk obstetrician, and (for patients with 
kidney disease) a nephrologist.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Prognosis 
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most serious rheumatic 
diseases. SLE can affect so many organs that a cause of death in some people 
with SLE may not be directly attributed to the condition. A primary cause of 
death among patients with lupus is atherosclerosis, a disease of the coronary 
blood vessels resulting from accelerated buildup of plaque.</p> 
<p>SLE is unpredictable and varies greatly form one individual to the next.</p>
<p><em>Mild SLE</em>. About 20 - 30% of cases are mild. The only symptoms may 
be the skin rashes of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or subacute cutaneous 
lupus erythematosus (SCLE) with or without joint aches. The number and 
intensity of symptoms in mild cases often decrease over time, as does the 
likelihood of major organ involvement. Patients with mild SLE should still be 
tested for organ involvement.</p> 
<p><em>Widespread SLE</em>. More commonly, SLE is a chronic, life-long 
disease, alternating between periods of symptom relapse, (called flares), and 
remission. The disease may begin in any of the various systems of the body and 
progress unpredictably to others. The following are typical patterns:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Symptom relapses, or flares, occur on the average of two or three times a 
year.</li> 
<li>Between flares, most patients with SLE function at about 90% of normal 
capacity.</li> </ul> 
<p>The degree of severity depends on different factors:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Severity of the inflammatory response</li> 
<li>Frequency of episodes</li> 
<li>The degree of organ or system involvement</li> </ul> 
<p>Vital organs or systems, such as lungs, kidneys, nervous system, joints 
skin, and others are affected in over a half of patients with SLE. Infections 
followed by kidney failure are the chief causes of death in patients with SLE.
</p> 
<p>Because of more effective and aggressive treatment, the prognosis for SLE 
has improved markedly over the past two decades. Treatment early in the course 
of the illness improves long-term progress. About 85 - 95% of people with lupus 
survive 10 years, and many people have a normal life span. SLE that develops 
later in life is generally less serious than SLE that strikes in childhood or 
young adulthood.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>No single test can confirm or rule out SLE. A number of tests are required 
before SLE can be diagnosed definitively. The first symptoms of SLE can 
resemble one of many syndromes or disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, 
Still's disease, rheumatic fever, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenia purpura, cryoglobulinemia, Weber-Christian disease, viral 
infections, vasculitis, psychosis, and other conditions. Other autoimmune 
disorders, such as Sj&ouml;gren syndrome or scleroderma, may even be present at 
the same time as SLE.</p> 
<h3>Criteria for Diagnosing System Lupus Erythematosus</h3> <br>

<p>1. Characteristic rash across the cheek</p> <br>

<p>2. Discoid lesion rash</p> <br>

<p>3. Photosensitivity</p> <br>

<p>4. Oral ulcers</p> <br>

<p>5. Arthritis</p> <br>

<p>6. Inflammation of membranes in the lungs, the heart, or the abdomen</p> 
<br> 
<p>7. Evidence of kidney disease</p> <br>

<p>8. Evidence of severe neurologic disease</p> <br>

<p>9. Blood disorders, including low red and white blood cell and platelet 
counts</p> <br>

<p>10. Immunologic abnormalities</p> <br>

<p>11. Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA)</p> <br>

<p><b>Note</b>: A patient must experienced four of the criteria before a 
doctor can classify the condition as SLE. These criteria, proposed by the 
American College of Rheumatology, are not to be relied upon solely for 
diagnosis, however.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Tests for Autoantibodies</h3> 
<p>Methods for measuring the antibodies involved with SLE vary, and the range 
of results can be bewildering. Repeat tests may be needed.</p> 
<p><i>Antinuclear Antibodies (ANAs).</i> A primary test for SLE checks for 
antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which attack the cell nucleus.</p> 
<p>High levels of ANA are found in more than 98% of patients with SLE. Other 
conditions, however, also cause high levels of ANA, so a positive test is not a 
definite diagnosis for SLE:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Antinuclear antibodies may be strongly present in other autoimmune 
diseases (such as scleroderma, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, or rheumatoid arthritis).
</li> 
<li>They also may be weakly present in about 20 - 40% of healthy women.</li> 
<li>Some drugs can also produce positive antibody tests, including 
hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, and chlorpromazine.</li> </ul> 
<p>A negative ANA test makes a diagnosis of SLE unlikely but not impossible. 
High or low concentrations of ANA also do not necessarily indicate the severity 
of the disease, since antibodies tend to come and go in patients with SLE.</p> 
<p>In general, the ANA test is considered a screening test:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If SLE-like symptoms are present and the ANA test is positive, other tests 
for SLE will be administered.</li> 
<li>If SLE-like symptoms are not present and the test is positive, the doctor 
will look for other causes, or the results will be ignored if the patient is 
feeling healthy.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>ANA Subtypes.</i> In some cases, doctors may test for specific ANA 
subtypes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anti-double stranded DNA (Anti-ds DNA) is more likely to be found only in 
patients with SLE. It may play an important role in injury to blood vessels 
found in SLE, and high levels often indicate kidney involvement. Anti-ds DNA 
levels tend to fluctuate over time and may even disappear.</li> 
<li>Anti-Sm antibodies are also usually found only with SLE. Levels are more 
constant and are more likely to be detected in African-American patients. 
Although many lupus patients may not have this antibody, its presence almost 
always indicates SLE.</li> 
<li>When the ANA is negative but the diagnosis is still strongly suspected, a 
test for anti-Ro (also called anti-SSA) and anti-La (also called anti-SSB) 
antibodies may identify patients with a rare condition called ANA negative, Ro 
lupus. These autoantibodies may be involved in the sun-sensitive rashes 
experienced by patients with SLE and are also found in association with 
neonatal lupus syndrome, in which a pregnant mother's antibodies cross the 
placenta and cause inflammation in the developing child's skin or heart.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><i>Antibodies to SR Proteins.</i> An advance in diagnosing SLE has been the 
detection of antibodies to molecules called SR proteins, which are carried by 
most patients. The test accurately detects lupus in 50 - 70% of patients who 
test positive for these antibodies.</p> 
<p><i>Antiphospholipid Antibodies.</i> In patients with SLE in whom blood 
abnormalities are suspected, tests may be able to detect the presence of the 
two major antiphospholipid antibodies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A quarter to a half of patients with SLE may have these antibodies. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies increase the risks for blood clots and may be 
responsible for narrowing of (and irregularities in) blood vessels. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies are linked with miscarriages and other pregnancy 
complications, strokes, heart attacks and blood clots in almost any part of the 
body, including kidneys, legs, lungs, and eyes.</li> 
<li>The test for the <i>lupus anticoagulant antibody</i> measures the time it 
takes blood to clot. A longer than normal blood clotting time indicates a<i>
higher</i> chance for clotting in the body and, therefore, the presence of 
lupus anticoagulant.</li> 
<li>An ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is performed to detect 
the<i>anticardiolipin antibody</i>.</li> </ul> 
<p>As with the ANA, these antibodies also have a tendency to appear and 
disappear in a single patient. Patients who have these autoantibodies as well 
as blood clotting problems or frequent miscarriage are diagnosed with 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which often occurs in SLE but can also develop 
independently.</p> 
<h3>Miscellaneous Blood Tests</h3> 
<p><i>Complement.</i> Blood tests of patients with SLE often show low levels 
of serum complement, a protein in the blood that aids the body's infection 
fighters. Individual proteins are termed by the letter &quot;C&quot; followed 
by a number. Common complement tests measure C3, C4, C1q, and CH50. Complement 
levels are especially low if there is kidney involvement or other disease 
activity.</p> 
<p><em>LE Cell Tests</em>. The first blood test ever used for SLE called LE 
(lupus erythematosus) cell test is positive in only about half of patients with 
SLE and is no longer used that often.</p> 
<p><em>Blood Count</em>. White and red blood cell and platelet counts are 
usually lower than normal and, depending on severity, are used to determine 
complications, such as anemia or infection.</p> Click the icon to see an image 
of the formed elements of blood. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Skin Tests</h3> 
<p>If a skin rash is present, the doctor may take a biopsy (a tissue sample) 
from the margin of a skin lesion. A test known as a lupus band detects 
antibodies known as immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are located just below the 
outer layer of the tissue sample. They are much more likely to be present with 
active SLE then with inactive disease. The biopsy will not differentiate 
between systemic and discoid lupus, but it can rule out other diseases. Tests 
for other antibodies will rule out or confirm discoid lupus and subacute 
cutaneous lupus.</p> 
<h3>Tests for Serious Complications of SLE</h3> 
<p><i>Kidney Damage and Lupus Nephritis.</i> Kidney damage in patients already 
diagnosed with SLE may be detected from the following tests:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Blood tests that measure creatinine, a protein metabolized in muscles and 
excreted in the urine. High levels suggest kidney damage, although kidney 
problems can also be present with normal creatinine levels.</li> 
<li>Tests for detecting anti-ds DNA antibodies and complements.</li> 
<li>A kidney biopsy. This may be performed to determine if lupus nephritis is 
present when less invasive tests indicate kidney involvement. It is not 
absolutely accurate but it helps determine treatment. Electron microscopy (very 
high-powered electronic microscopes) may be especially important in obtaining 
critical information on the degree of kidney damage.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Lung and Heart Involvement.</i> A chest x-ray may be performed to check 
lung and heart function. An electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram are 
administered if heart disease is suspected.</p> Click the icon to see an image 
of an electrocardiogram. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><i>Central Nervous System Complications.</i> SLE occurring in the central 
nervous system (CNS) can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are 
easily confused with other psychiatric and neurologic conditions.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tests of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for elevated levels of 
autoantibodies are the most reliable ways to detect CNS complications caused by 
a faulty immune system.</li> 
<li>Additional tests, including electroencephalograms (EEGs), magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or x-rays may be useful when 
blood vessel blockage in the brain is suspected.</li> 
<li>If the doctor suspects that CNS symptoms are caused by infection, 
especially for patients who are receiving immunosuppressant therapy, a lumbar 
puncture should be performed.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Osteoporosis.</i> To detect early osteoporosis in patients with SLE 
whose disease has lasted more than 3.5 years, doctors recommend an imaging test 
called dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to measure bone mineral density.
</p> Back to Top <br>
 Treatment 
<p>No treatment cures systemic lupus erythematosus, but many therapies can 
suppress symptoms and relieve discomfort. Treatment of SLE varies depending on 
the extent and severity of the disease.</p> 
<p>Only three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of lupus:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Prednisone</li> 
<li>Aspirin</li> 
<li>Hydroxychloroquine</li> </ul> 
<p>However, none of these drugs are the current standard of care. In everyday 
practice, numerous other drugs are commonly used. Researchers are conducting 
numerous clinical studies and drug investigations. Genetic research in lupus is 
progressing very rapidly, and hopefully new drugs will be approved in the 
future. There are also different drugs available to treat some of the 
conditions associated with lupus.</p> 
<h3>Treating Mild Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3> 
<p>Less intensive treatments may be effective for symptoms of mild lupus. They 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Creams and sunblocks for rashes</li> 
<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for fever, arthritis, and headache
</li> 
<li>Antimalarial drugs for pleurisy, mild kidney involvement, and inflammation 
of the tissue surrounding the heart</li> </ul> 
<h3>Treating Severe Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3> 
<p>More aggressive treatment is needed if there is serious disease 
progression, as evidenced by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hemolytic anemia</li> 
<li>Low platelet count with an accompanying rash (thrombocytopenia purpura)
</li> 
<li>Major involvement in the lungs or heart</li> 
<li>Significant kidney damage</li> 
<li>Acute inflammation of the small blood vessels in the extremities or 
gastrointestinal tract</li> 
<li>Severe central nervous system symptoms</li> </ul> 
<p>The primary approach to treating severe SLE is to suppress the immune 
factors, most often first with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant 
drugs. Investigational drugs and procedures are also showing promise.</p> 
<h3>Treating Specific Complications</h3> 
<p>The major complications of the disease must be treated as separate 
problems, keeping in mind the specific aspects of SLE. They are discussed 
elsewhere in this report.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Treatment for Cutaneous and 
Mild SLE 
<p><em>Creams.</em> Steroid creams are often used for skin lesions. However, 
many patients with discoid lupus do not respond to steroids, particularly if 
they have eruptions that are caused by sun sensitivity. A cream derived from 
vitamin A (Tegison) may help some lesions that do not clear up with steroid 
creams.</p> 
<p><i>Sun Protection.</i> Sun protection is essential. Patients should always 
use sunblock creams (not just sunscreens) and always wear hats and clothing 
made of tightly woven fabrics.</p> 
<h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3> 
<p><i>Common NSAIDs.</i> NSAIDs block prostaglandins, the substances that 
dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain. There are dozens of 
NSAIDs.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Over-the-counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), 
naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT).</li> 
<li>Prescription NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, 
Anaprox), diclofenac (Voltaren), tolmetin (Tolectin), ketoprofen (Orudis, 
Oruvail), dexibuprofen (Seractil).</li> </ul> 
<p>For people with lupus, NSAIDs may help relieve:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Joint pain and swelling</li> 
<li>Muscle pain</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Side Effects</em>. Regular, long-term use of NSAIDs can cause ulcers 
and gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia. To avoid these 
problems, it's best to take NSAIDs with food or immediately after a meal. 
Long-term use of NSAIDs (with the exception of aspirin) can also increase the 
risk for heart attack and stroke.</p> 
<p>Other NSAID side effects may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Upset stomach</li> 
<li>Dyspepsia (burning, bloated feeling in pit of stomach)</li> 
<li>Drowsiness</li> 
<li>Skin bruising</li> 
<li>High blood pressure</li> 
<li>Fluid retention</li> 
<li>Headache</li> 
<li>Rash</li> 
<li>Reduced kidney function</li> </ul> 
<p>Patients who have kidney problems associated with lupus (lupus nephritis) 
should be especially cautious about using NSAIDs. Patients with lupus who take 
NSAIDs on a regular basis should have their liver and kidney function tested 
every 3 - 4 months.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Antimalarial Drugs</h3> 
<p>A doctor may prescribe antimalarial drugs for discoid lupus (skin sores) or 
mild lupus when skin problems and joint pains are the predominant symptoms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is the most common antimalarial drug used 
for lupus. This drug is effective as maintenance therapy to reduce flares in 
patients with mild or inactive disease. Hydroxychloroquine may help protect 
against blood clots in people with antiphospholipid syndrome, high cholesterol 
levels, and bone loss.</li> 
<li>Other antimalarial drugs include chloroquine (Aralen) or quinacrine 
(Atabrine).</li> </ul> 
<p>Treatment may start initially with high doses in order to accumulate high 
levels of the drug in the bloodstream. It is not known exactly why 
antimalarials work. Some researchers believe they inhibit the immune response, 
and others think they interfere specifically with inflammation.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> Side effects of antimalarials may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Skin rash</li> 
<li>Change in skin color (yellow in the case of quinacrine)</li> 
<li>Gastrointestinal problems</li> 
<li>Headache</li> 
<li>Hair loss</li> 
<li>Muscle aches</li> 
<li>Eye damage</li> </ul> 
<p>The most serious is damage to the retina, although this is very uncommon at 
low doses. Eye damage after taking hydroxychloroquine is reversible when caught 
in time and treated, but it is not reversible if the damage develops after 
taking chloroquine. An eye exam is advisable about every 6 months.</p> 
<p>Antimalarials may also be used in combination with other anti-SLE drugs, 
including immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. It should be noted that 
smoking significantly reduces the effectiveness of antimalarial drugs.</p> Back 
to Top <br>
 Treatment for Severe SLE 
<h3>Corticosteroids</h3> 
<p>Severe SLE is treated with corticosteroids, also called steroids, which 
suppress the inflammatory process. Steroids can help relieve many of the 
complications and symptoms, including anemia and kidney involvement.</p> 
<p>Oral prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone) is usually prescribed. Other drugs 
include methylprednisolone (Medrol, Solumedrol), hydrocortisone, and 
dexamethasone (Decadron).</p> 
<p>Some people need to take oral prednisone for only a short time; others may 
require it for a long duration. An intravenous administration of 
methylprednisolone using &quot;pulse&quot; therapy for 3 days is proving useful 
for flare-ups in the joints. Combinations with other drugs, particularly 
immunosuppressants, may be beneficial.</p> 
<p>Regimens vary widely, depending on the severity and location of the 
disease. Most patients with SLE can eventually function without prednisone, 
although some may have to choose between the long-term toxicity of 
corticosteroids and the complications of active disease.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects of Long-Term Oral Corticosteroids.</i> Unfortunately, 
serious and even life-threatening complications have been associated with 
long-term steroid use. The bone-thinning condition osteoporosis is a common and 
particularly severe long-term side effect of prolonged steroid use. Medications 
that can prevent osteoporosis include calcium supplements, parathyroid hormone, 
alendronate risedronate, or hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal 
women.</p> 
<p>Other side effects associated with prolonged use of oral steroids include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cataracts</li> 
<li>Glaucoma</li> 
<li>Diabetes</li> 
<li>Fluid retention</li> 
<li>Susceptibility to infections</li> 
<li>Weight gain</li> 
<li>High blood pressure</li> 
<li>Acne</li> 
<li>Excess hair growth</li> 
<li>Wasting of the muscles</li> 
<li>Menstrual irregularities</li> 
<li>Irritability</li> 
<li>Insomnia</li> 
<li>Psychosis</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Withdrawal from Long-Term Use of Oral Corticosteroids.</i> Long-term use 
of oral steroid medications suppresses secretion of natural steroid hormones by 
the adrenal glands. After withdrawal from these drugs, this so-called adrenal 
suppression persists and it can take the body a while (sometimes up to a year) 
to regain its ability to produce natural steroids again. A few cases of severe 
adrenal insufficiency have occurred when patients switched from oral to inhaled 
steroids, which, in rare cases, has resulted in death.</p> 
<p>No one should stop taking any steroids without consulting a doctor first, 
and if steroids are withdrawn, regular follow-up monitoring is necessary. 
Patients should discuss with their doctors measures for preventing adrenal 
insufficiency during withdrawal, particularly during stressful times, when the 
risk increases.</p> 
<h3>Immunosuppressant Drugs</h3> 
<p>Drugs known as immunosuppressants are often used, either alone or with 
corticosteroids for very active SLE, particularly when kidney or neurologic 
involvement or acute blood vessel inflammation is present. These drugs suppress 
the immune system by damaging cells that grow rapidly, including those that 
produce antibodies. About a third of patients take immunosuppressants at some 
point in the course of the disease.</p> 
<p><i>Specific Immunosuppressants.</i> The most common immunosuppressants are:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) used to be considered the gold standard of 
treatment for lupus kidney disease (lupus nephritis). Cyclophosphamide is given 
intravenously and is sometimes used in combination with corticosteroids or 
other drugs. It has been used for lupus since the 1970s. Side effects are very 
severe and include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, infertility, and infections.
</li> 
<li>Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept, Myfortic) is now becoming the new 
standard. Many recent studies have shown that this drug works better than 
cyclophosphamide and causes far fewer severe side effects (diarrhea is the main 
side effect). Unlike cyclophosphamide, it is taken by mouth. Most doctors now 
recommend mycophenalate mofetil as a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed 
patients with mild or moderate lupus kidney disease. It may not be appropriate 
for patients with kidney failure or rapidly progressing kidney disease. 
Mycophenolate mofetil should not be used during pregnancy as it can cause 
miscarriage and birth defects.</li> 
<li>Azathioprine (Imuran) has the lowest toxicity, but is less effective than 
other immunosuppressants.</li> 
<li>Cyclosporine (Sandimmune) has been used for years, mostly for SLE 
associated with kidney involvement. High blood pressure is common, however, 
with this drug.</li> </ul> 
<p>The most frequent side effects of immunosuppressants include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Stomach and intestinal problems</li> 
<li>Skin rash</li> 
<li>Mouth sores</li> 
<li>Hair loss</li> </ul> 
<p>Serious side effects of immunosuppressants include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Low blood cell counts</li> 
<li>Anemia</li> 
<li>Menstrual irregularity</li> 
<li>Early menopause</li> 
<li>Ovarian failure</li> 
<li>Infertility</li> 
<li>Herpes zoster (shingles)</li> 
<li>Liver and bladder toxicity</li> 
<li>Increased risk of cancer</li> </ul> 
<p>In general, immunosuppressants should not be used alone unless 
corticosteroids are ineffective or inappropriate. Grapefruit juice has an 
enzyme that may enhance the effects of some immunosuppressants.</p> 
<h3>Investigational Treatments</h3> 
<p><em>Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs).</em> A MAb is a laboratory-made protein 
that targets specific immune cells, such as B cells. B cell over-activation has 
been identified as a key component of the lupus disease process. Promising MAbs 
in development for SLE treatment include epratuzumab and belimumab.</p> 
<p><em>Intravenous Immunoglobulins</em>. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 
are sometimes used for patients who have not responded to other SLE treatments. 
Immunoglobulins are antibodies produced by immune system B-lymphocyte cells. 
IVIG is a blood product that contains these antibodies.</p> 
<p><em>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).</em> Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a 
natural steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands and converted 
into estrogen and androgen. The synthetic equivalent of DHEA, prasterone 
(Prestara), is being investigated as a potential treatment for SLE. Prasterone 
is still in the drug development stage and it is not clear when, or if, it will 
be commercially available.</p> 
<p><i>Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation.</i> Some patients with severe 
lupus have achieved at least short-term remission after undergoing autologous 
transplantation of stem cells and high-dose drug therapy to suppress the 
damaging immune factors. Stem cells are the early forms for all blood cells in 
the body. An autologous transplant is one in which marrow or blood cells used 
are the patient's own. (The advantage to an autologous transplant is that the 
patient's own cells are not at risk for rejection by the immune system.)</p> 
<p><i>Phototherapy.</i> A promising treatment uses ultraviolet A-1 (UVA-1) 
radiation, long UVA wave lengths that do not promote sunburn and may actually 
block inflammatory immune factors. Small studies have suggested that UVA-1 
phototherapy may have some benefits for lowering disease activity in SLE.</p> 
<p><em>Plasmapheresis</em>. Plasmapheresis is a process in which the fluid 
part of the blood, called plasma, is removed from blood cells. The procedure 
involves first taking blood from the patient. The plasma, which contains the 
inflammatory antibodies and other immunologically active substances, is 
discarded and replaced with other fluids. The blood is then returned. 
Plasmapheresis is not useful for routine management of patients but may have 
some benefits for patients who do not respond to standard treatments or in 
specific cases, such as lupus patients with hemolytic anemia.</p> 
<h3>Treatments for Some Complications of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3> <br>
<p><b>Infections, Inflammation, or Hypertension in the Lungs</b></p> 
<p><i>Preventive Measures.</i> Immunizations with inactive viruses and 
preventive antibiotics should be considered for patients with SLE who are at 
high risk for infection.</p>
<p><i>Treating Infections.</i> Lung infections need to be treated aggressively 
with antibiotics. However, antibiotic drugs such as penicillin or the sulfa 
drugs may cause sensitivity rashes that can be confused with SLE rash.</p>
<p><i>Treating Lung Inflammation.</i> While inflammation of the lung 
(pneumonitis) resembles pneumonia, it is not an infection but is a result of 
the autoimmune process. This condition needs to be treated with corticosteroids 
or immunosuppressants, but only if the doctor is sure infection is not present.
</p>
<p><i>Treating Pulmonary Hypertension.</i> Pulmonary hypertension is very 
serious. Drugs known as prostacylins -- which include epoprostenol, iloprost, 
and treprostinil -- are standard drugs. Bosentan (Tracleer) is the first oral 
drug approved for pulmonary hypertension. An inhaled iloprost formulation 
(Ventavis) was approved in 2004. Sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio) may also be used 
for this condition. Lung transplantation may be required.</p> <br>

<p><b>Bleeding and Clotting Disorders</b></p> 
<p><i>Antiphospholipid Syndrome and Clotting Disorders.</i> Hydroxychloroquine 
or aspirin may help prevent blood clots in women with antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS). (Aspirin does not appear to be protective in men who carry the 
autoantibodies responsible for APS.) In patients who have experienced blood 
clots, treatment with the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin) is advisable. This 
blood-thinning drug may be needed lifelong. Scientists are investigating other 
treatment options, including autologous stem cell transplantation. The 
procedure has shown promise in studies for treating lupus-associated APS, but 
it is still experimental.</p>
<p><em>Excess Bleeding from Thrombocytopenia (Drop in Blood Platelets).</em> 
Treatments that may be effective for thrombocytopenia include combinations of a 
corticosteroid and either danazol (a male hormone) or the antimalarial 
hydroxychloroquine. Immunosuppressants or intravenous immunoglobulin IgG may be 
helpful in some patients. Surgical removal of the spleen may be advisable if 
bleeding disorders are a serious problem, but this option should be considered 
carefully, because the spleen provides one line of defense against infection. 
(Abnormal spleen function, in any case, appears to be fairly common in SLE.)</p>
<br> 
<p><b>Kidney Disease</b></p> 
<p><i>Drugs.</i> Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept, Myfortic) and intravenous 
cyclophosphamide, as well as steroids are used to treat lupus kidney disease.
</p>
<p><i>Procedures.</i> Kidney transplant or dialysis should be considered for 
patients with SLE with severe kidney damage. For unknown reasons, SLE does not 
generally recur in the transplanted kidneys. Studies are conflicting, however, 
over whether SLE transplant patients have higher organ-rejection rates than 
other kidney-transplant recipients. Both transplantation and dialysis have 
potentially serious complications.</p>
<p><i>Plasmapheresis.</i> It is not clear if plasmapheresis is beneficial for 
SLE kidney disease.</p> <br>

<p><b>Osteoporosis</b></p> 
<p>Treatments for osteoporosis include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, 
parathyroid hormone, and selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs). [For 
more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #18: Osteoporosis.]</p> <br>

<p><b>Heart Disease</b></p> 
<p>The need for aggressive treatment of high blood pressure often accompanies 
kidney disease. SLE is also accompanied by high cholesterol levels, which 
requires diet changes and drug therapies. [For more information, see<em>
In-Depth Reports</em> #3: Coronary artery disease; #14: High blood pressure; 
#23:Cholesterol; and #43: Heart healthy diet.]</p> <br>

 Lifestyle Changes 
<h3>Staying Active</h3> 
<p>People with SLE should try to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. 
Light-to-moderate exercise, interspersed with rest periods, is good for the 
heart, helps fight depression and fatigue, and can help keep joints flexible.
</p> 
<h3>Preventing Infections</h3> 
<p>Patients should be sure they are fully immunized and should minimize their 
exposure to crowds or people with contagious illnesses. Careful hygiene, 
including dental hygiene, is also important.</p> 
<h3>Avoiding SLE Triggers</h3> 
<p>It is very important that patients with SLE avoid excessive exposure to 
sunlight. Simple preventive measures include avoiding overexposure to 
ultraviolet rays and wearing protective clothing and sunblocks. There is some 
concern that allergy shots may cause flare ups in certain cases. Patients who 
may benefit from them should discuss risks and benefits with an SLE specialist. 
In general, patients with SLE should use only hypoallergenic cosmetics or hair 
products.</p> 
<h3>Reducing Stress</h3> 
<p>Chronic stress has profound physical effects and influences the progression 
of SLE. Getting adequate rest of at least 8 hours and possibly napping during 
the day may be helpful. Maintaining social relationships and healthy activities 
may also help prevent the depression and anxiety associated with the disease.
