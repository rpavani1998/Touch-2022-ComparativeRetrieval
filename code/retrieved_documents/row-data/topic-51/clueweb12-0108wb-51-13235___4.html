STORY BY <br>

<h2>Anissa Anderson Orr</h2> 
<p>Aspirin relieves fever, muscle pain and headaches, prevents some heart 
attacks and strokes and may even help prevent Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>And, in light of recent concerns over cousin-drugs like ibuprofen and 
naproxen and the outright removal of Vioxx and Bextra from the market, the 
humble little aspirin is enjoying renewed attention.</p> 
<p>So what makes this, &ldquo;wonder drug that works wonders,&rdquo; so 
wonderful? Can a drug that&rsquo;s been around for thousands of years really be 
as good as&mdash;and safer than&mdash;newer prescription medications?</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I am still captivated by aspirin. I have been since I was a kid and 
it was just for reducing fever then,&rdquo; says Dr. Lenard M. Lichtenberger, 
professor in the Department of Integrative Biology &amp; Pharmacology at The 
University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston. 
Lichtenberger has spent much of his career studying aspirin. &ldquo;I believe 
that aspirin deserves all the credit that it receives.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Barking Up the Right Tree</h2> 
<p>Hipprocates, the father of modern medicine, used ground willow tree bark to 
ease aches and pains way back in the fifth century. Willow bark contains the 
chemical salicin, or salicylic acid.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>By the late 1800s, salicylic acid became the standard drug to treat 
arthritis. However, it was very harsh and irritated the stomach. Felix 
Hoffmann, a German chemist with Friedrich Bayer and Company, synthesized 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in 1897 as a treatment for his father's arthritis. 
The synthesized form of the drug didn&rsquo;t hurt the stomach as much and was 
better at treating pain. By 1899, The Bayer Company was providing aspirin to 
physicians to give to their patients.</p> 
<h2>Why Aspirin Works</h2> 
<p>After all these years, experts still are not exactly sure how it works. The 
most widely accepted theory is that aspirin helps reduce the level of chemicals 
in the blood called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain by stimulating 
the muscles to contract and blood vessels to dilate. Aspirin stops the 
prostaglandins from forming by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 or 
COX-2. Aspirin is the first known COX-2 inhibitor, and the first of a class of 
drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The downside is that aspirin also blocks the COX-1 enzyme which helps 
protects the lining of the stomach. As a result, aspirin can increase the risk 
for gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.</p> 
<p>Over the past few decades, researchers have developed new NSAIDS. General 
NSAIDS like ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) block both COX-1 
and COX-2 and are available over the counter. To better protect the stomach, 
even more targeted NSAIDS, called COX-2 inhibitors were developed to block only 
the COX-2 enzyme. But two of these drugs, Vioxx and Bextra were taken off the 
market earlier this year because of increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
</p> 
<p>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a separate class of pain relievers and fever 
reducers, and is gentler on the stomach than NSAIDS but boasts no 
anti-inflammatory properties.</p> 
<h2>Heart Disease and Aspirin</h2> 
<p>Because aspirin is so safe, doctors say taking it daily or every other day 
is an easy way for most people older than age 40 to protect their hearts. The 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men age 40 and older, women 
who are past menopause and younger people with risk factors for heart attack or 
stroke, such as diabetes or smoking, discuss aspirin therapy with their doctors.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Aspirin is very inexpensive, it not only relieves pain and fever but 
has an anti- inflammatory effect,&rdquo; says cardiologist Dr. Samuel W. 
Casscells, the John Edward Tyson Distinguished Professor of Medicine at the UT 
Houston Medical School. &ldquo;Aspirin and aspirin only prevents blood clots. 
Aspirin&rsquo;s cousins, such as NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors, don&rsquo;t 
prevent blood clots.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 1985 the use of aspirin 
to prevent heart attacks in patients who had either suffered a previous heart 
attack or suffered from unstable angina. The decision was based on evidence 
that aspirin reduced the risk of a second heart attack by 20 percent. For 
patients suffering from unstable angina, the risk of a heart attack decreased 
by 51 percent.</p> 
<p>The most effective dosage of aspirin is still a matter of contention, 
although most doctors recommend the lowest dose possible to minimize side 
effects. Doses range from one-quarter of a baby aspirin to full adult doses, 
depending on its medical purpose and your doctor&rsquo;s recommendations.</p> 
<p>Aspirin&rsquo;s role in preventing heart attacks has not been studied as 
much in women. The Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative, a randomized study of 
40,000 women between the ages of 45 and 65, found that low dose aspirin did not 
prevent first heart attacks or cardiovascular events in the total group of 
women studied.</p> 
<p>However, for women older than 65 in the study, aspirin reduced the risk of 
major cardiovascular events by 26 percent.</p> 
<h2>Stroke and Aspirin</h2> 
<p>Aspirin has also been shown to help reduce the risk of <strong>ischemic 
stroke</strong> (a result of a clot blocking an artery in the brain) which is 
also the most common kind of stroke. And in some cases, aspirin may work better 
at preventing stroke in high-risk patients than more sophisticated 
anti-clotting drugs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&ldquo;People at risk of developing ischemic strokes should consider 
aspirin instead of warfarin, a common anti-clot drug,&rdquo; says Dr. James 
Grotta, professor of neurology at the medical school and director of the stroke 
program at Memorial Hermann Hospital.</p> 
<p>In a study of 569 people, patients on warfarin (Coumadin), suffered a 
higher death rate and had more bleeding compared to those who took aspirin. 
Results of the study appeared in the March 31 issue of the<em>New England 
Journal of Medicine</em>.</p> 
<p>Aspirin reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in women who took low-dose 
aspirin by 24 percent, according to the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative study. 
It also has shown some promise in preventing a variety of diseases and health 
conditions ranging from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to colon cancer.</p> 
<h2>Not for Everyone</h2> 
<p>Aspirin is not without some risks. </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Because it <strong>increases risk for stomach bleeding</strong>, consult 
your doctor before taking aspirin therapy if you have an ulcer. Your doctor may 
also prescribe a medicine to counteract acid in the stomach.</li> 
<li>People with certain <strong>clotting deficiencies</strong> should not take 
aspirin.</li> 
<li>Children under age 18 should not be given aspirin to treat viral 
infections because of its link to the deadly condition known as<strong>Reye's 
Syndrome</strong>. Always consult your doctor, first. </li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t take aspirin if you have an aspirin allergy or a history of 
uncontrolled high blood pressure.</li> 
<li>While aspirin is often recommended to treat a heart attack until the 
patient can get medical help,<strong>don&rsquo;t take aspirin to treat a stroke
</strong>. </li> </ul> 
<p>&ldquo;If you think you are having a stroke call 9-1-1, don&rsquo;t take an 
aspirin,&rdquo; Grotta says. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain 
and aspirin may make it worse, he says. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to take 
aspirin until you know it is not a bleeding stroke.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The bottom line? Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of aspirin and any 
risk factors you may have before starting aspirin therapy.</p> 
<h2>Improving a Miracle</h2> 
<p>While researchers continue to uncover new ways to use aspirin, others are 
working hard to improve it. Lichtenberger has developed a patented process that 
binds aspirin with phosphatidylcholine (PC), a purified form of lecithin 
derived from soybeans. The PC-aspirin protects the lining of the stomach. But 
unlike currently used enteric coatings, it is easily dissolved, allowing the 
aspirin to cross into the bloodstream more quickly.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Every few months I get surprised by another new application for 
aspirin,&rdquo; Lichtenberger says. &ldquo;But I think another area of interest 
that we are pursuing is reducing the side effects of aspirin and getting a much 
better understanding of NSAIDS and how they act, with the hope that we can 
further improve the drug&rsquo;s cardioprotective actions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He hopes protecting the stomach may make aspirin a more palatable option 
for people prone to gastrointestinal bleeds, but also at high risk for heart 
attack. Such a development would be more than welcome by doctors like 
Casscells, looking for a safe and effective drug to prescribe their patients.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Aspirin is still a miracle drug,&rdquo; Casscells says. 
&ldquo;Number one: the other more expensive drugs don&rsquo;t prevent blood 
clots. Number two: we&rsquo;ve had it for 100 years, and it is a natural 
compound from tree bark. These reasons give you great comfort when prescribing 
aspirin.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Health Tip:</h4> 
<p><strong>The mouth:<br>
 a window to the body</strong></p> 
<p>Researchers have found connections between periodontal (gum) infections and 
other diseases throughout the body, suggesting a link between gum disease, 
heart disease and other health conditions.</p> 
<p>Research suggests that gum disease may be as serious a risk factor for 
heart disease as hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, gender and age. Those with 
gum disease seem to be at higher risk for heart attacks. Possible explanations 
involve mouth bacteria that loosen and flow to the arteries, creating arterial 
plaque.</p> 
<p>If your dentist diagnoses you with gum disease, inform your medical health 
care provider, too.</p>
