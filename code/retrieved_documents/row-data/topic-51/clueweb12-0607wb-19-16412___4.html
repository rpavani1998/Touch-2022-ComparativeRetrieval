Ibuprofen 
<p></p> 
<p> <i>Common brand names</i>: Advil, Nuprin, Motrin and many others. </p> 
<p> <i>Description</i>: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID). It relieves pain, reduces fever and decreases swelling.</p> 
<p> <i>Dental uses</i>: In dentistry, ibuprofen is prescribed to treat mild to 
moderate pain. The pain can be from dental surgery, toothache or the 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A 200 milligram dose of ibuprofen in liquid-gel 
form has been shown to work better than 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen. For 
more severe dental pain, 400 milligrams of ibuprofen works better than 650 
milligrams of aspirin, or 650 milligrams of acetaminophen plus 60 milligrams of 
codeine.</p> 
<p> <i>Dosages for dental purposes</i>: The prescription for ibuprofen after 
dental surgery is usually 400 milligrams every 4 to 6 hours, as needed. The 
maximum daily dose should not exceed 2,400 milligrams. For pain after surgery, 
ibuprofen is usually given for less than 5 days.</p> 
<p>For TMJ pain related to arthritis, higher doses (600 to 800 milligrams 
every 6 to 8 hours) may be needed. The maximum daily dose is 3,200 milligrams.
</p>
<p> Daily dosing for children is based on age and body weight. Prescription 
dosages are different than &quot;over-the-counter&quot; dosages.</p> 
<p> <i>Concerns and possible side effects</i>: For dental uses of a week or 
less, ibuprofen is a very safe, well-tolerated and effective pain reliever. 
Side effects include abdominal pain, nausea and increased bleeding time. 
Ibuprofen is less likely to cause side effects than aspirin.</p> 
<p>NSAIDs have some black-box warnings. These are warnings on the package 
insert about possible serious side effects. For ibuprofen, these include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&quot;NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of adverse 
cardiovascular events, including MI [heart attack], stroke, and new onset or 
worsening of pre-existing hypertension [high blood pressure].&quot;</li> 
<li> &quot;NSAIDs may increase risk of gastrointestinal irritation, 
ulceration, bleeding and perforation.&quot;</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Some people may take ibuprofen for many weeks or months. For example, 
people with TMJ pain may need to take this drug for a long time. With long-term 
use, more serious side effects can occur. They include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bleeding ulcers </li> 
<li>Perforations of the stomach and small intestine (in 1% to 4% of patients) 
</li> 
<li>Reduced kidney function </li> </ul> 
<p></p>
<p> Blood pressure should be monitored in patients taking ibuprofen. </p> 
<p>Ibuprofen should not be given to: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>People who are allergic to aspirin or other NSAIDs </li> 
<li>Certain people with asthma who are sensitive to NSAIDs. In these people, 
these drugs can bring on an asthma attack.</li> 
<li>Pregnant women, especially during the last three months of pregnancy </li> 
<li>People with kidney disease </li> 
<li>People with ulcers of the stomach or the small intestine</li> </ul> 
<p></p>
<p>Avoid drinking alcohol if you are taking ibuprofen. Alcohol increases the 
risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding. Ibuprofen also may interact with other 
drugs, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aspirin &mdash; People taking both aspirin and ibuprofen may lose the 
heart-protective effects of aspirin and increase their risk of bleeding.</li> 
<li>Lithium (Eskalith) &mdash; If this drug is combined with ibuprofen, it can 
lead to lithium toxicity.</li> 
<li>Warfarin (Coumadin) and other anticoagulants &mdash; Taking these with 
ibuprofen can lead to increased bleeding.</li> 
<li>Some high blood pressure medicines, including beta blockers, ACE 
inhibitors and diuretics &mdash; Combining any of these with ibuprofen may 
increase blood pressure.</li> </ul> 
<p></p>
<p> These interactions can be serious. Always tell your dentist about all of 
the drugs you are taking.</p> <br>
