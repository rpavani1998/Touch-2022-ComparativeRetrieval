 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic fatigue 
syndrome. Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>Causes</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Researchers have discovered 88 different genes in patients with chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS) related to blood disease, immune system function, and 
infection. Within this group of genes, the researchers identified seven 
subtypes, which could relate to infection response, and which might be used as 
part of a diagnostic test. They also honed in on five genes that could be 
possible targets for treatment.</li> 
<li>Researchers have discovered further evidence that a faulty stress response 
contributes to CFS. Women with CFS have significantly lower levels of the 
stress hormone, cortisol when they wake up in the morning compared with women 
who don't have the condition. Men with CFS do not have a similar drop in 
cortisol level, suggesting that a difference in the cortisol response may 
contribute to the increased risk of CFS only in women.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Depression is a common symptom of CFS. In one study, 36% of CFS patients 
were depressed. Depression in these patients was associated with lower 
self-esteem and an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>CFS patients appear to have slower motor speed and reduced working memory 
than those without the condition, and these changes don't seem to be related to 
any psychological conditions or medication use.</li> 
<li>Children with CFS have more difficulty than usual paying attention and 
remembering, which may explain why kids with this condition have more trouble 
in school than their peers.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective at reducing the symptoms 
of fatigue compared with usual care. This treatment appears to be more 
effective than other psychological therapies.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Introduction 
<p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), sometimes called immune dysfunction 
syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (in Europe), is not a new disorder. In 
the 19th century the term neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion, was applied to 
symptoms resembling CFS. In the 1930s through the 1950s, outbreaks of disease 
marked by prolonged fatigue were reported in the United States and many other 
countries. Beginning in the early- to mid-1980s, interest in chronic fatigue 
syndrome was revived by reports in America and other countries of various 
outbreaks of long-term debilitating fatigue.</p> 
<p>Unexplained chronic fatigue describes fatigue that lasts for more than 6 
months, impairs normal activities, and has no identifiable medical or 
psychological problems to account for it. In addition to fatigue, people may 
complain of other problems, such as difficulty with memory or concentration, 
headaches, or sore muscles or joints.</p> 
<p>The symptoms of CFS may be categorized as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).</em> A number of criteria must be met 
in order for a patient's symptoms to be described as CFS. Six million patient 
visits are made each year because of fatigue, although only a very small 
percentage of these visits can be attributed to actual chronic fatigue syndrome.
</li> 
<li><i>Idiopathic chronic fatigue.</i> If the symptoms do not meet the 
criteria for CFS, the condition is referred to as idiopathic chronic fatigue, 
meaning the cause is unknown.</li> </ul> 
<p>Although the exact causes of CFS are not known, researchers think 
infection, genetics, hormonal imbalances, and chemical toxins play roles in 
different patients.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>In studies of large patient groups, 15 - 27% of people complain of 
long-term fatigue, but the majority of this fatigue can be explained by other 
medical or psychological problems. According to surveys, chronic fatigue 
syndrome (CFS) itself affects more than four out of every 1,000 Americans.</p> 
<p>CFS occurs in both sexes, at all ages, and in all racial and ethnic groups. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 1 
and 4 million people in the U.S. have the disease, but only half of people with 
CFS have seen their doctor for the condition. About 40% of people who report 
symptoms of CFS have another medical or psychiatric condition, according to the 
CDC.</p> 
<h3>Age and Gender</h3> 
<p>People ages 40 - 50 most often experience chronic fatigue. Studies have 
found that four out of five people with CFS are women, although women do not 
appear to have more severe symptoms than men with the disorder.</p> 
<p>Children and adolescents can also have CFS. Most studies indicate that 
girls are more likely than boys to develop CFS, although one study found the 
incidence of the syndrome to be equal in children of both genders.</p> 
<h3>Depression and Psychological Factors</h3> 
<p>The link between psychological disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome is 
problematic because so many of the symptoms overlap. The rates of depression 
are very high in CFS patients, possibly higher than in patients with other 
conditions (notably fibromyalgia and multiple chemical sensitivity).</p> 
<p>Studies report that most children and adolescents with CFS have psychiatric 
disorders. Psychological factors during childhood may increase susceptibility 
for CFS later in life, although studies have not found any consistent 
association between emotional or personality disorders and CFS to explain any 
causal role. Some psychological factors may, however, be risk factors for CFS.
</p> 
<p>Depression is very common in the general population. It affects up to 
one-fifth of all Americans at some point in their lives, and most depressed 
people feel fatigued.</p> 
<h3>Stress</h3> 
<p>There is some evidence that stress may trigger CFS in people who are 
genetically at risk for the disease.</p> 
<h3>Conditions That Commonly Occur in CFS Patients</h3> 
<p>A number of conditions overlap or coexist with chronic fatigue syndrome and 
have similar symptoms. Patients with CFS may also have a diagnosis of 
fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivity, or both. It is not clear whether 
these and other conditions are risk factors for CFS, are direct causes, have 
common causes, or have no relationship at all with CFS.</p> 
<p><i>Fibromyalgia.</i> Fibromyalgia causes prolonged fatigue and widespread 
muscle aches. It is the disease most often confused with CFS. The two 
conditions also commonly appear together. In fact, many experts believe 
fibromyalgia is simply another variant of chronic fatigue syndrome or they are 
different manifestations of the same disease. CFS patients experience severe 
fatigue, whereas fibromyalgia patients experience more pain. One hypothesis is 
that the connection between the two conditions may be found in central 
sensitization, which is thought to cause fibromyalgia and may also cause CFS.
</p> 
<p>A characteristic feature of fibromyalgia is the existence of at least 11 
distinct sites of deep muscle tenderness that hurt when touched firmly. The 
sites often include the:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Side of the neck</li> 
<li>Top of the shoulder blade</li> 
<li>Outside of the upper buttock and hip joint</li> 
<li>Inside of the knee</li> </ul> 
<p>Some patients with CFS exhibit similar tender pressure points. Recurrent 
sore throat, headache, low fever, and depression are also common symptoms of 
fibromyalgia. Like CFS, fibromyalgia is chronic and not curable.</p> 
<p><i>Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.</i> Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) 
is a term now used to describe a condition in which certain chemicals are 
believed to cause symptoms similar to CFS in some people. MCS has also been 
observed in people with CFS. The following proposed criteria can help recognize 
people with MCS:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The symptoms are reproducible with repeated exposure to a chemical. (These 
are often common chemicals found in popular products, such as perfumes, fabric 
softeners, and air fresheners.)</li> 
<li>The condition is chronic.</li> 
<li>Symptoms can be produced by exposure to the chemical at levels lower than 
the person previously or commonly tolerated.</li> 
<li>The symptoms improve when the chemical is removed.</li> 
<li>Symptoms can be triggered by multiple substances that are chemically 
unrelated.</li> 
<li>Symptoms involve multiple organ systems.</li> </ul> 
<p>As with CFS and fibromyalgia, there is uncertainty as to whether MCS is an 
actual medical condition or is psychologically based. In one study, for 
example, CFS patients who believed their problem was chemically triggered were 
exposed to either an active chemical or a placebo (an inactive substance). Both 
groups reported symptoms, including those exposed only to the placebo. It 
should be noted that everyone is exposed to many chemicals on a daily basis, 
and it is very difficult to determine whether chemicals are responsible for 
specific symptoms.</p> 
<p><i>Eating Disorders.</i> Eating disorders, notably bulimia and anorexia, 
have been observed in patients with CFS. The conditions often have overlapping 
risk factors, although it is unclear whether one causes the other.</p> 
<p><i>Other Conditions that Commonly Coexist With CFS.</i> A number of other 
conditions also may coexist with CFS and occur at higher-than-average rates 
among CFS patients:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chronic headaches</li> 
<li>Cognitive problems such as difficulty concentrating, impaired memory, and 
symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li> 
<li>Interstitial cystitis</li> 
<li>Irritable bowel syndrome</li> 
<li>Sleep problems</li> 
<li>Temporomandibular disorder (TMD)</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>Theories abound about the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome. No primary 
cause has been found that explains all cases of CFS, and no blood tests or 
brain scans can definitively diagnose the condition.</p> 
<p><i>Convergence of Factors.</i> A number of experts believe that CFS 
develops from a convergence of conditions that may include the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Genetic factors</li> 
<li>Brain abnormalities</li> 
<li>A hyper-reactive immune system</li> 
<li>Viral or other infectious agents</li> 
<li>Psychiatric or emotional conditions</li> </ul> 
<p>For example, most patients report some moderate-to-serious physical illness 
(such as a chronic viral infection) or emotional event (like an episode of 
depression) before CFS. Some experts theorize that such events, alone or in 
combination, may interact with certain neurologic and genetic abnormalities to 
trigger CFS.</p> 
<p>Still, it is not clear what sequence of events actually leads to the 
fatigue and other prominent symptoms of this disorder. Nor is there any 
specific brain or nervous system problem that experts can point to with 
assurance.</p> 
<h3>Genetic Defects</h3> 
<p>CFS has been linked with genes involved in the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. These 
genes control response to trauma, injury, and other stressful events. 
Nevertheless, researchers have been unable to determine how the genetic 
variations influence symptoms.</p> 
<p>A number of studies have found alterations in genes involved with immune 
function, communication between cells, and transfer of energy to cells.</p> 
<p>Researchers have identified many different genes in patients with CFS 
related to blood disease, immune system function, and infection. However, no 
clear pattern has been found.</p> 
<h3>Central Nervous System and Hormone Abnormalities</h3> 
<p>Abnormal levels of certain chemicals regulated in the brain system known as 
the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have been proposed as a cause of 
CFS. This system controls important functions, including sleep, stress 
response, and depression. Of particular interest to researchers are the 
following chemicals and other factors controlled by the HPA axis:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Changes in Important Neurotransmitters.</i> Some patients with CFS have 
abnormally high levels of serotonin -- a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger 
in the brain), deficiencies of dopamine -- an important neurotransmitter 
associated with feelings of reward, or imbalances between norepinephrine and 
dopamine. However, routine clinical testing for such chemical imbalances is 
cost-prohibitive.</li> 
<li><i>Stress Hormone Deficiencies.</i> A number of studies on CFS patients 
have observed lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone produced in the 
adrenal glands. Deficiencies of cortisol have been suggested as the reason why 
CFS patients have an impaired and weaker response to psychological or physical 
stresses, such as infection or exercise. However, administering replacement 
cortisol improves symptoms only in some patients.</li> 
<li><i>Disturbed Circadian Rhythms.</i> Evidence suggests that, in certain 
patients, CFS is a disorder of the sleep-wake cycle, which is regulated by the 
so-called circadian clock, a nerve cluster in the HPA axis. Some mentally or 
physically stressful event, such as a viral infection, may disrupt natural 
circadian rhythms. An inability to reset these rhythms results in a perpetual 
cycle of sleep disturbances. Medications that improve sleep can be very helpful 
for certain patients with CFS.</li> </ul> 
<p>It is still not clear whether any of these changes are causes of chronic 
fatigue syndrome, or merely findings in some patients.</p> 
<h3>Infections</h3> 
<p>Because most of the features of CFS resemble those of a lingering viral 
illness, many researchers have focused on the possibility that a virus or some 
other infectious agent causes the syndrome in some cases.</p> 
<p>Still, not all CFS patients show signs of infection. Although experts have 
long been divided on whether infections play any role in this disorder, 
subtypes of viral-related and non-viral CFS may both exist.</p> 
<p><i>Viruses.</i> The theory that CFS has a viral cause is not based on hard 
evidence, but on various observations that suggest an association, such as the 
following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>CFS patients may be found to have elevated levels of <i>antibodies</i> to 
many organisms that cause fatigue and other CFS symptoms. Such organisms 
include those that cause Lyme disease, candida (&quot;yeast infection&quot;), 
herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), 
Epstein-Barr, measles, coxsackie B, cytomegalovirus, or parvovirus. Many of 
these infectious agents are very common, however, and none has emerged as a 
significant cause of CFS. Well-designed studies of patients who met strict 
criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome and of patients with chronic fatigue 
without any known cause have not found an increased incidence of any specific 
infections.</li> 
<li>In up to 80% of cases, chronic fatigue syndrome starts suddenly with a 
flu-like condition. However, there is no evidence that CFS is spread through 
casual contact, such as shaking hands or coughing, or by intimate sexual 
contact.</li> 
<li>In the U.S., there have been reports of cluster outbreaks of CFS occurring 
within the same household, workplace, and community (but most have not been 
confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). However, most 
cases of CFS occur sporadically in individuals, and do not appear to be 
contagious.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Immune System Abnormalities</h3> 
<p>CFS has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;chronic fatigue immune 
dysfunction syndrome.&quot; A number of studies have found many irregularities 
of the immune system. Some components appear to be over-reactive, while others 
appear to be under-reactive, but no consistent picture has emerged to explain 
CFS as a disease of the immune system.</p> 
<p><i>Allergies.</i> Some studies have reported that a majority of CFS 
patients have allergies to foods, pollen, metals (such as nickel or mercury), 
or other substances. One theory is that allergens, like viral infections, may 
trigger a cascade of immune abnormalities leading to CFS. However, most 
allergic people do not have CFS.</p> 
<p><i>Autoimmune Abnormalities.</i> The risk profile for chronic fatigue 
syndrome is similar to the risk profiles for a number of autoimmune diseases. 
Studies are inconsistent, however, in reporting the presence of autoantibodies 
(antibodies that attack the body's own tissues) in CFS, and the disease is 
unlikely to be due to autoimmunity.</p> 
<h3>Low Blood Pressure</h3> 
<p>Studies have observed that some patients who fit the strict criteria for 
chronic fatigue syndrome also have symptoms of a condition known as neurally 
mediated hypotension (NMH). NMH causes a dramatic drop in blood pressure when a 
person stands up, even for as little as 10 minutes. Its immediate effects can 
be lightheadedness, nausea, and fainting.</p> 
<p>However, studies have reported no higher incidence of NMH in chronic 
fatigue patients.</p> 
<h3>Psychological Factors</h3> 
<p>Psychological, personality, and social factors are strongly associated with 
chronic fatigue in most patients. The complex relationship between physical and 
emotional factors has yet to be fully understood, however. Studies have not 
found any consistent association between emotional or personality disorders and 
CFS to explain a causal role. Psychological factors, then, are unlikely to be a 
primary cause of CFS. However, they may play a role in increasing 
susceptibility to the disorder. In many cases, CFS promotes psychological and 
social dysfunction.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>It is very difficult to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. Even experts do 
not have a clear definition of what chronic fatigue actually is, or what 
mechanisms in the brain or nervous system are responsible for it. The best 
diagnostic approach is to determine whether the patient matches the criteria 
for CFS and to rule out other possible causes of symptoms.</p> 
<h3>Criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3> 
<p>In May 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released 
a revised definition for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome based on a consensus of many 
of the leading CFS researchers and doctors (including input from patient group 
representatives). In the revised definition, chronic fatigue syndrome is 
considered a subset of chronic fatigue, a broader category defined as 
unexplained fatigue that lasts for 6 months or longer. Chronic fatigue is 
considered a subset of prolonged fatigue, which is defined as fatigue that 
lasts for 1 month or more.</p> 
<p>Unexplained chronic fatigue can be classified as CFS if the patient meets 
the following criteria:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue that is either new or 
that started at a definite period of time; is not the result of ongoing 
exertion; is not substantially relieved by rest; and significantly reduces 
activities such as work, education, and social life.</li> 
<li>Also, four or more of the following symptoms, which must have continued or 
recurred during 6 or more consecutive months of illness and must not have 
started before the fatigue:
<ul> 
<li>Significant impairment in short-term memory or concentration</li> 
<li>Sore throat</li> 
<li>Tender lymph nodes</li> 
<li>Muscle pain</li> 
<li>Joint pain without swelling or redness</li> 
<li>Headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity</li> 
<li>Unrefreshing sleep</li> 
<li>Malaise that lasts for more than 24 hours after exertion</li> </ul></li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Conditions that Can Rule Out a CFS Diagnosis</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Any active medical condition that may explain the presence of chronic 
fatigue, such as:
<ul> 
<li>Untreated hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland)</li> 
<li>Sleep apnea and narcolepsy (common sleep disorders)</li> 
<li>Side effects of medication</li> </ul></li> 
<li>An illness (such as cancer, or hepatitis B or C virus infection) that 
relapsed or did not completely get better during treatment, that could explain 
the presence of chronic fatigue.</li> 
<li>A past or current major depressive disorder, such as: 
<ul> 
<li>Bipolar affective disorder</li> 
<li>Schizophrenia</li> 
<li>Delusional disorder</li> 
<li>Dementia</li> 
<li>Anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Alcohol or other substance abuse that occurs within 2 years of the onset 
of chronic fatigue and at any time afterward.</li> 
<li>Severe obesity, as defined by a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater 
than 45. (Note: Body mass index values vary considerably among different age 
groups and populations. No &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;average&quot; range of 
values can be suggested. The range of 45 BMI or higher was selected because it 
falls within the range of severe obesity.)</li> </ol> 
<p>Any other abnormality found during an exam or other tests that could 
explain CFS symptoms must be resolved before further attempting to classify the 
condition.</p> 
<p>In 2007, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
released new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CFS in adults and 
children. According to these guidelines, CFS may be diagnosed if the person has 
disabling fatigue that starts suddenly, lasts a long time, keeps coming back, 
and can't be explained by another condition.</p> 
<p>People with CFS also can have the following symptoms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, remembering, finding the right words, 
planning, and organizing</li> 
<li>Difficulty sleeping</li> 
<li>Dizziness or nausea</li> 
<li>General malaise or flu-like symptoms</li> 
<li>Headaches</li> 
<li>Muscle or joint pain in many areas of the body without inflammation</li> 
<li>Painful lymph nodes without disease</li> 
<li>Fast heartbeat (palpitations) without heart problems</li> 
<li>Sore throat</li> 
<li>Worsening of symptoms with physical exertion</li> </ul> 
<p>After ruling out other possible causes, the doctor should consider a 
diagnosis of CFS if symptoms have lasted for 4 months in adults or 3 months in 
children. Children should be diagnosed by a pediatrician.</p> 
<h3>Personal and Medical History</h3> 
<p>A doctor should first take a careful personal and family medical history 
(which may include a psychological profile), as well as perform a thorough 
physical examination. Patients should be prepared to answer questions such as:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When did the fatigue first begin?</li> 
<li>Does anything make it worse or better?</li> 
<li>Is it better at certain times of the day?</li> 
<li>Does physical activity make it worse?</li> 
<li>Are there any other symptoms?</li> 
<li>Has anyone else in the family ever complained of fatigue?</li> 
<li>Is your personal and professional life stressful?</li> </ul> 
<p>The doctor may also ask about any changes in weight, or request that a 
patient monitor his or her morning and afternoon body temperatures. Patients 
should report any drugs they are taking, including vitamins and 
over-the-counter or herbal medications.</p> 
<h3>Laboratory Tests</h3> 
<p>Standard tests are typically recommended to rule out specific conditions 
that can cause persistent fatigue. These tests include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Blood count</li> 
<li>Blood tests for gluten sensitivity</li> 
<li>C-reactive protein</li> 
<li>Creatine kinase</li> 
<li>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or plasma viscosity</li> 
<li>Liver function</li> 
<li>Random blood sugar (glucose)</li> 
<li>Serum calcium</li> 
<li>Serum creatinine</li> 
<li>Serum ferritin levels (only in children)</li> 
<li>Thyroid function</li> 
<li>Urea and electrolytes</li> 
<li>Urine test for protein, blood, and glucose</li> </ul> 
<p>No blood, urine, or other laboratory test can specifically diagnose CFS. If 
any test is abnormal, it is not useful for diagnosing CFS specifically, and the 
doctor should look for other causes of these abnormalities.</p> 
<p>That said, research has found that certain components in urine are unique 
in people with CFS, and may someday be considered biomarkers of the disease. 
Additionally, antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, increased levels of 
isoprostanes, and decreased levels of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) -- markers 
of oxidative stress -- have been found in the blood of people with CFS.</p> 
<h3>Identifying Other Causes of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3> 
<p>Among the many other common conditions that can lead to feelings of 
temporary exhaustion are the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Depression</li> 
<li>Infections</li> 
<li>Pregnancy</li> 
<li>Extreme exercise</li> 
<li>Excessive stress</li> </ul> 
<p>In most of these cases, fatigue can be relieved with adequate rest. It is 
important to note that longstanding fatigue can be a sign of a serious medical 
or psychological problem. A number of more serious conditions may cause 
persistent fatigue and other symptoms of CFS and should be ruled out. Patients 
and doctors should not overlook these diseases, even if the conditions have 
been previously treated, because they may not have completely resolved or they 
may cause residual fatigue. Doctors can usually distinguish these diseases from 
CFS after a clinical evaluation and laboratory testing.</p> 
<p><i>Infectious Mononucleosis and Epstein-Barr Virus.</i> Infectious 
mononucleosis is marked by fatigue and swollen glands. It primarily affects 
adolescents and young adults. Some patients may have fatigue that lasts for 
many months. Blood tests will indicate the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which 
causes mononucleosis.</p> 
<p><i>Autoimmune Diseases.</i> Some diseases, including systemic lupus 
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, are caused by<i>
autoimmunity</i>, a condition in which the person's immune system attacks the 
body's own tissues. The early symptoms of these conditions may mimic some of 
those that appear in CFS, such as muscle and joint pain and fatigue. These 
diseases, like CFS, also occur more often in women than in men. Most of these 
conditions can be confirmed with laboratory or x-ray/radiologic findings. 
However, some autoimmune diseases may evolve slowly. Even if a diagnosis of 
chronic fatigue syndrome is considered, doctors should keep track of any 
changes in symptoms over time to rule out these serious illnesses.</p> 
<p><i>Post-Lyme Disease Syndrome.</i> Rarely, patients treated for Lyme 
disease continue to have nonspecific symptoms, which can last for years after 
antibiotic treatment and that resemble symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.</p>
<p><i>Depression and Severe Mental Disorders.</i> The Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC), which established the definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome, 
recognizes depression as one of the symptoms of CFS. In one study, 36% of CFS 
patients were depressed. Depression in these patients was associated with lower 
self-esteem and an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts. However, 
according to the CDC, anyone with a history of major depression or other severe 
psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, does not 
meet the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of major depression include the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A depressed mood every day</li> 
<li>Significant weight gain or loss (10% or more of an individual's usual body 
weight)</li> 
<li>Insomnia or excessive sleeping</li> 
<li>Restlessness or a sense of being slowed down</li> 
<li>Low energy every day</li> 
<li>Worthless or inappropriately guilty feelings</li> 
<li>An inability to concentrate or make decisions</li> 
<li>Suicidal thoughts</li> 
<li>Loss of interest and enjoyment</li> </ul> 
<p>Major depression is likely if a person has several of these symptoms and no 
physical symptoms (such as sore throat, aches and pains, or fever). The longer 
fatigue has continued without physical symptoms, the more likely that the 
diagnosis is depression.</p> 
<p>A persistent form of minor depression called dysthymia may be more 
difficult to differentiate from CFS and may actually account for a subset of 
CFS cases. Dysthymia is characterized by many of the same symptoms that occur 
in major depression, but they are less intense and last much longer -- at least 
2 years. The symptoms of dysthymia have been described as a &quot;veil of 
sadness&quot; that covers most activities.</p> 
<p>Patients with depression generally perceive their illnesses differently 
than people with CFS:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients with depression have significantly lower self-esteem, more 
thought distortions (for instance, focusing on the negative or personalizing 
their situations), and believe their condition stemmed from psychological 
factors.</li> 
<li>CFS patients, even those who also have depression or dysthymia, tend to 
identify medical causes as the source of their problems and to focus on 
physical symptoms.</li> </ul> 
<p>Many previously healthy patients with CFS become depressed and anxious 
because they feel so exhausted all the time. CFS may also lead to highly 
stressful socioeconomic situations, such as social isolation and poverty. These 
situations can contribute to, and even cause emotional disorders in susceptible 
individuals, which can worsen CFS.</p> 
<p><i>Sleep Disturbances.</i> Certain sleep disorders may cause persistent 
fatigue and can be confused with CFS:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sleep apnea is a common disorder that can cause daytime fatigue without 
the patient being aware of the problem. Apnea is actually a breathing disorder 
that is often marked by loud snoring and thrashing in bed. A person may not 
realize the problem exists unless it is brought to his or her attention by a 
sleeping partner or observer.</li> 
<li>Narcolepsy is a peculiar and rare disorder in which a person suddenly 
falls asleep without any previous signs of fatigue.</li> 
<li>Other sleep disorders that cause daytime fatigue include insomnia and 
restless legs syndrome.</li> </ul> 
<p>Researchers have found that people with CFS have altered amounts of slow 
wave sleep, which could indicate a problem with sleep regulation. 
Non-restorative sleep and nighttime restlessness are the most common complaints 
of people with CFS.</p> 
<p><i>Conditions that Cause Joint Pain, Muscle Aches, or Both.</i> A number of 
illnesses cause one or more CFS symptoms, including arthritic symptoms, fever, 
and fatigue.</p> 
<p><i>Severe Obesity.</i> People who are severely obese often have symptoms of 
chronic fatigue because of the stress imposed by their weight. People who are 
obese are also at higher risk for sleep apnea, which can confuse the diagnosis.
</p> 
<p><i>Other Medical Conditions that Usually Rule Out CFS.</i> Many diseases, 
both benign and serious, can fully explain prolonged or chronic fatigue, 
including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hepatitis</li> 
<li>Anemia</li> 
<li>Hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease caused by iron overload)</li> 
<li>Various forms of cancer</li> 
<li>Neuromuscular diseases (such as myasthenia gravis)</li> 
<li>Hypothyroidism</li> 
<li>Diabetes</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Drugs and Alcohol.</i> Fatigue is a side effect of many prescription and 
over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines. In addition, dependency 
on or abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs may manifest as chronic fatigue. 
Medications should be considered as a possible cause of fatigue if an 
individual has recently started, stopped, or changed medicines. Withdrawal from 
caffeine can produce depression, fatigue, and headache.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Prognosis 
<p>The physical severity of chronic fatigue syndrome varies. Most commonly, 
patients with CFS report that they have trouble fulfilling both home and work 
responsibilities.</p> 
<p>Many CFS sufferers cannot work more than part-time. In unusual cases, 
patients are severely disabled and even bedridden. Such patients can do 
virtually nothing -- even light housework.</p> 
<p>Patients with CFS are more likely to lose their jobs, possessions, and 
support from friends and family than are people who have other conditions that 
cause fatigue.</p> 
<h3>Mental Incapacity</h3> 
<p>Most patients say that while fatigue is the most incapacitating symptom, 
mental impairment, such as an inability to concentrate or remember, is the most 
distressing symptom. The effects of CFS on mental functioning are complex. Some 
experts believe that the impaired mental functioning is due to depression, 
which is common in CFS patients. However, one study found that CFS patients 
have slower motor speed and reduced working memory than those without the 
condition, and these changes were independent of any psychological conditions 
or medication use.</p> 
<p>Athough general intelligence is not impaired, CFS patients may test lower 
in certain mental functions, particularly speed and efficiency in processing 
complex information, and 40 - 60% have memory impairments. This impaired mental 
function occurs even if there is no depression or other psychiatric disorders.
</p> 
<h3>Long-Term Outlook in Adults</h3> 
<p>Because the illness remains elusive and poorly defined, and there are few 
objective measures for recovery, experts have found it difficult to determine 
the long-term course of the disease. Many patients are not covered by insurance 
or have difficulty finding good care, so available statistics may be incorrect. 
Bearing these factors in mind, some studies have reported that more than half 
of patients who complain of chronic fatigue are still fatigued at 2 years. 
Although a variety of studies have attempted to identify factors that predict a 
more chronic or severe course, no clear conclusions can be made. Even if 
patients get progressively worse, however, the disorder is not fatal.</p> 
<h3>Outlook in Children</h3> 
<p>Although children with symptoms of chronic fatigue have not been as 
rigorously studied as adults, limited evidence suggests that CFS can be 
significantly disabling in young people. Studies report that adolescents who 
meet the criteria for CFS also have greater anxiety, depression, and school 
absenteeism than their peers. One study found that children with CFS have more 
difficulty than usual paying attention and remembering, which may explain why 
these kids have more trouble in school than their peers.</p> 
<p>Still, some studies indicate that children have a better prognosis than 
adults and most will recover after 1 - 4 years. Several studies have indicated 
that cognitive-behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for adolescents 
with CFS.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Treatment 
<p>There is no proven or reliable cure for CFS, and no drug has been developed 
specifically for this disorder. Because CFS remains poorly understood, many 
patients have problems finding good care. Overall, the recommended strategy for 
treatment includes a combination of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A healthy diet</li> 
<li>Antidepressant drugs in some cases, usually low-dose tricyclics</li> 
<li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise for certain patients
</li> 
<li>Medication</li> 
<li>Sleep management techniques</li> </ul> 
<p>Patients with the best chance for improvement are those who remain as 
active as possible and who seek to have some control over the course of the 
disorder. Patients should choose physicians who are willing to consider the 
problem as a medical condition with psychiatric components. They should be very 
wary, however, if the physician recommends excessive and expensive treatments 
that may have serious adverse effects and that have no proven benefits. For 
patients with severe CFS that cannot be managed with lifestyle changes and 
standard medications, asking the physician about enrolling in any available 
clinical trials may be helpful.</p> 
<p><strong>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</strong></p> 
<p>CBT is designed to help CFS patients regain a sense of control, and is 
proving to have substantial benefits for some patients. Some experts believe 
that patients who are diagnosed with CFS should be referred to therapists 
trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy. (Psychoanalysis and other 
interpersonal psychological therapies, which are concerned with subconscious 
thoughts and early childhood memories, are not generally helpful for CFS 
patients.)</p> 
<p><i>The Goals of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy.</i> The primary goals of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (referred to below as just cognitive therapy) are 
to change any distorted perceptions that individuals have of the world and of 
themselves, and to change their behavior accordingly. For CFS patients, this 
means learning to think differently about their fatigue, improving their 
ability to deal with stressful situations, and managing their disorder. CBT can 
also help people manage their sleep problems and find the appropriate activity 
levels for them. Cognitive therapy is particularly helpful for defining and 
setting limits, behaviors that are extremely important for these patients.</p> 
<p><i>The Procedure</i>. CBT is usually performed over 6 - 20 sessions, each 
lasting about an hour. Patients are also given homework, which usually includes 
keeping a diary and attempting tasks that they have avoided because of previous 
negative attitudes.</p> 
<p>A typical cognitive therapy program may involve the following measures:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep a Diary. The patient is almost always asked to keep an energy diary, 
which can be a key component of CFS cognitive therapy. The diary serves as a 
general guide for setting limits and planning activities. The patient uses the 
diary to track any factors, such as a job or relationship, that may be making 
the fatigue worse or better. It is also used to track the times of day when 
energy levels are at their highest and lowest.</li> 
<li>Adjust Schedule. The patient adjusts schedules to conform to energy peaks 
and valleys recorded in the diary. For instance, the patient may take a nap 
during low-energy times and plan important activities during high-energy times. 
Developing regular daily routines around probable energy spurts or drops may 
help establish a more predictable pattern.</li> 
<li>Confront Negative or Discouraging Thoughts. Patients are taught to 
challenge and reverse negative beliefs (such as &quot;I'm not good enough to 
control this disease, so I'm a total failure.&quot;), and to use coping 
statements (&quot;Where is the evidence that I can control this disease?&quot;)
</li> 
<li>Be Flexible. Energy levels will most likely never be entirely predictable. 
Patients must be prepared to adapt to energy variations. Instead of taking a 
long nap, for instance, patients may need 5- to 10-minute rest periods every 
hour or more, possibly involving relaxation or meditation.</li> 
<li>Set Limits. Limits are designed to keep both mental and physical stress 
within a manageable framework so that patients do not get discouraged by 
forcing themselves into situations in which they are likely to fail. For 
example, tasks are broken down into incremental steps and patients focus on one 
step at a time.</li> 
<li>Prioritize. Patients learn to drop some of the less critical tasks or 
delegate them to others.</li> 
<li>Manage Impaired Concentration. Patients seek out activities that are 
appealing, focus attention, and help increase alertness. They learn to request 
instructions given as concise, simple statements. External distractions, such 
as music or talking, are kept to a minimum.</li> 
<li>Accept Relapses. Over-coping and accomplishing too much too soon can often 
cause a relapse of symptoms. Patients should respect these relapses and back 
off. They should not consider them a sign of treatment failure or personal 
failure.</li> </ul> 
<p>Using both self-observation and specific tasks, patients gradually shift 
their fixed ideas that they are helpless against the fatigue that dominates 
their lives. They move to the perception that fatigue is only one negative 
experience among many positive ones.</p> 
<p><i>Success Rates.</i> One review of CFS trials reported that, of all 
therapies available to CFS patients, only cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
and graded exercise showed conclusive benefits. CBT is effective at reducing 
the symptoms of fatigue compared with usual care, and it appears to be more 
effective than other psychological therapies. Although CBT doesn't bring 
patients completely back to normal, research has found that people who use the 
therapy have higher mental health scores, and are able to walk faster and with 
less fatigue than those who did not use CBT. Cognitive therapy may also be an 
effective treatment for adolescents with CFS. Young patients who received CBT 
have reported improvements in fatigue, functional status, and school attendance.
</p> 
<p>Not all studies support the benefits of cognitive therapy for CFS. It is 
important to note that different therapists may have different fundamental 
assumptions about CBT and may use different techniques. For instance, some 
therapists believe that CFS is a purely psychological problem and that patients 
must reject the notion of physical causes, abandon all reliance on assistive 
devices, and participate in challenging exercise programs. Other therapists do 
not attempt to change patients' underlying beliefs, but instead focus on 
helping patients conserve energy and better cope with the limitations of their 
illness. When considering CBT, patients and their families must be aware of 
such important differences in therapists.</p> 
<p>The power of the mind to improve or oppose health problems is significant, 
and treatments that promote a positive outlook are beneficial for<i>any</i> 
disease.</p> 
<h3>Graded Exercise</h3> 
<p>A number of studies have suggested that a graded exercise program, in which 
patients perform increasingly more intense levels of exercise tailored to their 
individual abilities, has benefits for many patients with CFS. Exercise is best 
performed in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy.</p> 
<p>Reports have found that 75% of CFS patients who were able to engage in 
exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, reported less fatigue and better daily 
functioning and fitness after a year. A review of clinical trials found that 
exercise therapy is beneficial for CFS, particularly when combined with patient 
education.</p> 
<p>Some patient groups and experts contend that such studies use only patients 
with less severe conditions, and therefore the results do not apply to many CFS 
patients. Many patients have severe conditions, and some are very incapacitated 
(such as being wheelchair bound). These patients are unlikely to be able to do 
graded exercise. All CFS patients, in fact, have a lower exercise capacity than 
healthy individuals, and over-exercising can intensify symptoms. Some patients 
experience profound fatigue following even modest exercise. It is the primary 
reason for the low activity levels in these patients.</p> 
<p>The following tips may be helpful for CFS patients when embarking on an 
exercise program:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Work with your health care provider to determine a good starting level of 
activity for you. Start slowly and incrementally, beginning with as few as 3 - 
5 minutes of moderate exercise a day. The goal is to increase activity by about 
20% every 2 - 3 weeks, until you can handle about 30 minutes a day. Once you 
reach 30 minutes a day, start to increase the aerobic intensity of your 
workouts. (Capacity varies greatly among CFS sufferers, however, and some 
people may not be able to increase their aerobic intensity.)</li> 
<li>Establish limits and keep within them to avoid overexertion and relapse.
</li> 
<li>Experiment with different forms of physical activity that suit your 
available energy levels. Some patients report great benefits from yoga or tai 
chi, which combine exercise with meditation.</li> 
<li>Setbacks will occur, but do not become discouraged.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Activity Management</h3> 
<p>Work with your health care provider to find a level of activity you can 
handle. Then gradually increase your activity level. Activity management should 
involve:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Balancing your time between activity, rest, and sleep</li> 
<li>Spreading out more challenging tasks throughout the week</li> 
<li>Breaking big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones</li> 
<li>Avoiding doing too much on days when you feel tired</li> </ul> 
<h3>Healthy Diet</h3> 
<p>Although there is no evidence to support any specific dietary factors in 
CFS, patients should be sure to maintain a healthy diet that includes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Plenty of fresh, dark-colored fruits and vegetables, which are rich in 
antioxidants</li> 
<li>Fiber-rich foods</li> 
<li>Limited saturated fats (found in animal products)</li> 
<li>Omega-3 essential fatty acids, found in certain fish and oils</li> 
<li>Increased salt (<em>only</em> for those with low blood pressure)</li> 
<li>Starchy foods, particularly for nausea</li> </ul> 
<h3>Other Approaches for Managing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</h3> 
<p><i>Stress Reduction Techniques.</i> One panel of experts concluded that 
relaxation and stress-reduction techniques were helpful in managing chronic 
pain. These techniques also can help relieve the stress associated with the 
disease. They are not useful, however, as the primary treatment for CFS. A 
number of relaxation techniques are available, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Biofeedback</li> 
<li>Deep breathing exercises</li> 
<li>Hypnosis</li> 
<li>Massage therapy</li> 
<li>Meditation</li> 
<li>Muscle relaxation techniques</li> 
<li>Yoga</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Light Therapy.</i> Patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) 
experience more depression during the winter, when the hours of sunlight 
decrease. With light therapy (phototherapy), the patient sits for about 30 
minutes each day a few feet away from a box-like device that emits very bright 
fluorescent light (4,000 lux). Light therapy is best performed immediately 
after awakening in the morning.</p> 
<p>Some CFS patients don't have much improvement from light therapy. However, 
the treatment may still help some patients with CFS whose symptoms are similar 
to those of patients with SAD.</p> 
<p><i>Supportive Family and Groups.</i> Having strong, supportive 
relationships with family and friends can help CFS patients get better. 
However, CFS patients should try not to impose unreasonable expectations on 
loved ones. Attending support groups with fellow patients may be very helpful. 
In one study, sharing experiences in a group therapy setting proved to be the 
most valuable component in treatment, and it improved patients' coping 
abilities.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Medications 
<p>No medications are specifically approved to treat CFS. However, some may be 
useful for pain or other symptoms, or in cases where CFS may have a specific 
cause. Doctors generally use combinations of drugs to accomplish specific 
goals, such as medication at night to improve sleep and medication in the 
morning to improve cognition and energy. Treatment is very individualized.</p> 
<h3>Mild Pain Relievers</h3> 
<p><i>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).</i> Patients with CFS may 
find relief using NSAIDs -- common pain relievers that reduce pain and 
swelling. Types of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin), 
and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox).</p> 
<p>Although NSAIDs work well, long-term use can cause stomach problems, such 
as ulcers and bleeding. In April 2005, the FDA asked NSAID manufacturers to 
include a warning label on their products that alerts users of an increased 
risk for cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding. Due to its proven 
cardiovascular benefits, aspirin was excluded from these labeling revisions.</p>
<p>NSAIDs can also increase blood pressure, particularly among people already 
being treated for hypertension. (About 12 - 15% of elderly people take both an 
NSAID and an antihypertensive drug.) Piroxicam, naproxen, and indomethacin 
appear to pose the greatest risk of high blood pressure. Sulindac has the 
smallest effect.</p> 
<p>Other side effects of NSAIDs include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Ringing in the ears</li> 
<li>Headaches</li> 
<li>Skin rashes</li> 
<li>Possibly depression</li> </ul> 
<p>NSAIDs can cause kidney damage. (The damage gets better once the patient 
stops using the drug.) People with high blood pressure, severe circulation 
disorders, or kidney or liver problems, as well as people taking diuretics or 
oral hypoglycemics, must be closely monitored if they need to use NSAIDs on a 
long-term basis. Because NSAIDs reduce blood clotting, NSAID users who are 
scheduled for surgery should stop taking those drugs a week before the 
operation.</p> 
<p><i>COX-2 Inhibitors (Coxibs).</i> Coxibs block an inflammation-promoting 
enzyme called COX-2. This class of drugs was initially believed to work as well 
as traditional NSAIDs, but with fewer stomach problems. However, numerous 
reports of cardiovascular events, skin rashes, and other adverse effects 
prompted the FDA to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of the COX-2 drugs. 
Rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib (Bextra) were withdrawn from the U.S. market 
following reports of heart attacks in patients taking the drugs. Celecoxib 
(Celebrex) was still available at the time of this report, but labeled with 
strong warnings and a recommendation that it be prescribed at the lowest 
possible dose for the shortest duration possible. Patients should ask their 
doctor whether the drug is appropriate and safe for them.</p> 
<h3>Antidepressants</h3> 
<p>Because of the association between depression and CFS, antidepressants are 
often tried, with varying degrees of success. Common side effects of many 
antidepressants include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Constipation</li> 
<li>Dry mouth</li> 
<li>Reduced sexual drive</li> 
<li>Restlessness</li> 
<li>Slightly increased heart rate</li> </ul> 
<p>Virtually all antidepressants have complicated interactions with other 
drugs, and some of these interactions are very serious.</p> 
<p><i>Tricyclic Antidepressants.</i> Antidepressants known as tricyclics may 
be particularly helpful for CFS patients. For example, the tricyclic 
amitriptyline (Elavil) is known to relieve many of the symptoms of CFS, 
including sleeplessness and low energy levels. These drugs may provide benefits 
by promoting deep sleep and inhibiting pain pathways in the nervous system. 
Improvement in symptoms can take 3 - 4 weeks. Other tricyclics include doxepin 
(Sinequan), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), clomipramine 
(Anafranil), and imipramine (Tofranil, Janimine). Patients with CFS normally 
respond to much lower doses than those used to treat people with depression. In 
fact, many CFS patients cannot tolerate the higher doses commonly used to treat 
depression. As with all medications, tricyclics must be taken as directed. An 
overdose can be life-threatening. Tricyclics should not be taken together with 
SSRIs, because of the possibility of dangerous side effects.</p> 
<p><i>Other Antidepressants.</i> Newer, so-called designer SSRIs, including 
bupropion (Wellbutrin), nefazodone (Serzone), or mirtazapine (Remeron), affect 
combinations of different neurotransmitters, and some may have moderate 
benefits for CFS patients. For example, in one study, nefazodone improved mood, 
fatigue, and sleep disturbances.</p> 
<p><i>SSRIs.</i> The popular antidepressants known as selective 
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be helpful for the subgroup of CFS 
patients who experience significant depression. These drugs include fluoxetine 
(Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil). Cymbalta (duloxetine) is 
a new antidepressant that is classified as a selective serotonin and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI).</p> 
<h3>Other Drugs Being Investigated for CFS</h3> 
<p><i>Psychostimulants.</i> Psychostimulants may be helpful for a subgroup of 
patients with CFS who have cognitive problems, such as difficulty 
concentrating, memory problems, and other attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD)-like characteristics. Psychostimulants include Dexamphetamine, 
Adderall, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and Ritalin-like drugs such as Focalin, 
Concerta, Ritalin LA, and Metadate, as well as Strattera and Provigil. The NICE 
guidelines for CFS do not advise taking Dexamphetamine or Ritalin. However, a 
2007 study found that taking two 10 mg doses of Ritalin each day works much 
better than placebo at relieving fatigue and concentration problems. More 
research is needed to study the long-term effects of Ritalin on CFS patients.
</p> 
<h3>Alternative Remedies</h3> 
<p>Because of the difficulties in treating chronic fatigue syndrome, many 
patients seek alternative therapies. Some of these therapies, such as 
acupuncture, yoga, and relaxation techniques, may be helpful and are not 
dangerous. No scientific evidence exists that vitamin and mineral supplements 
will relieve CFS, but some people do report that they find supplements helpful.
</p> 
<p><i>Herbal and Dietary Supplements</i>. Popular herbal and dietary 
supplements for CFS include coenzyme Q10, vitamin B12, vitamin C, magnesium, 
multivitamins, DHEA, ginseng, and acetylcarnitine. None have been rigorously 
tested. Some herbs, such as St. John's wort, ginkgo, and comfrey, may cause 
serious side effects and drug interactions.</p> 
<p>Herbal remedies and dietary supplements are not regulated by the FDA. This 
means that manufacturers and distributors do not need FDA approval to sell 
their products. In addition, any substance that can affect the body's chemistry 
can, like any drug, produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a 
number of reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal 
products.</p> 
<p>Some so-called natural remedies have been found to contain standard 
prescription medication. Of specific concern are studies suggesting that up to 
30% of herbal remedies imported from China have been laced with potent 
pharmaceuticals, such as phenacetin and steroids. Most reported problems occur 
in herbal remedies imported from Asia. One study reported that a significant 
percentage of such remedies contain toxic metals.</p> 
<p>CFS patients should be wary of the following remedies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>St. John's wort. This herbal remedy is being investigated for mild 
depression. In one study, St. John's wort lessened fatigue in CFS patients, 
even in those who did not consider themselves to be depressed. However, the 
substance may have some serious side effects; for example, it can interact with 
blood thinning medication. Also, the package may not always contain what it 
promises. In a brand comparison, only three out of eight St. John's wort 
products contained within 10% of the active ingredient amounts claimed on the 
labels.</li> 
<li>Melatonin. Some patients use melatonin, based on the association between 
CFS and possible sleep abnormalities. However, the small amount of research 
available has not shown melatonin to be helpful.</li> 
<li>Gingko. Although the risks for gingko appear to be low, there is an 
increased risk of bleeding at high doses. In addition, gingko can interact with 
high doses of vitamin E and anti-clotting medications. Commercial gingko 
preparations have also been reported to contain colchicine, a substance that 
can be harmful in pregnant women and in people with kidney or liver problems. 
Some brands of gingko have no effect.</li> 
<li>Comfrey. Comfrey is an herbal remedy used for a number of inflammatory 
problems. Recently, evidence has emerged that comfrey can be toxic to the 
liver, and animal studies have reported a possible cancer risk. Comfrey is 
banned in Canada and other countries, but is still widely available in the U.S.
</li> 
<li>Products containing the ingredient Ma Huang. This ingredient contains the 
stimulants ephedrine and kola nut, a caffeine source. Serious adverse 
reactions, including seizures, psychosis, and several deaths, have been 
reported in people taking this supplement.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other alternative remedies with no proven benefit and possible toxic and 
dangerous side effects include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hydrogen peroxide injection (can cause blood clots or strokes)</li> 
<li>Megadoses of vitamins (can be toxic and have shown no benefits)</li> 
<li>High colonic enemas</li> 
<li>Bee pollen (can cause an allergic reaction)</li> 
<li>Injections of liver extract</li> 
<li>Superoxide dismutase (SOD)</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
