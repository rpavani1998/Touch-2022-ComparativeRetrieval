<p>Most of the magic bullets to treat colds and flu - from antibiotics to zinc 
lozenges - are shots in the dark and not as effective as tried-and-tested 
traditional remedies.</p> 
<p>Virtually everyone has a theory about colds and flu and, given the glut of 
information, it may be hard to separate the facts from plain fiction. Yet, 
there are data that show what makes us vulnerable to these infections, and how 
to stay well when the weather turns cold.</p> 
<p>Susceptibility and stress<br>
Catching the flu is not a random event. Bugs 
may be getting nastier (see box below), and our poorly ventilated, sometimes 
crowded, environments may encourage the spread of virulent viruses. But if 
exposure were the only factor, all of us would get sick every time we were 
exposed.</p> 
<p>In truth, many people in a room may be exposed to a cold or flu virus, but 
only some become infected. Susceptibility, not exposure, is the key and is 
likely to be influenced by a number of things.</p> 
<p>People who have heart complaints, asthma, chronic kidney disease or 
diabetes, or who are taking medications (for instance, steroids) are more 
susceptible to colds and flu. Smokers are also more susceptible to upper 
respiratory tract infection (URTI; Am J Public Health, 1993; 83: 1277-83).</p> 
<p>But predicting susceptibility in an otherwise healthy population is less 
straightforward. Nutritional status and exercise play a role (see boxes, pp 2 
and 3) but, recently, a great deal of study has focused on the role of stress.
</p> 
<p>The ability of stress to alter immune function, and precipitate and 
aggravate infectious diseases has long been recognised (J Fla Med Assoc, 1993; 
80: 409-11). Today, there is strong evidence that the single biggest risk 
factor that puts otherwise healthy people at risk of catching a cold may be 
stress.</p> 
<p>In one study, after determining their stress levels by questionnaire, 394 
subjects were exposed to common rhinoviruses (the virus causing the common 
cold). Only 27 per cent of the low-stress group showed clinical symptoms 
compared with 47 per cent of those at the high end of the scale (N Engl J Med, 
1991; 325: 606-12).</p> 
<p>In another study, 276 subjects, who had been carefully evaluated for their 
level of involvement in one or more of a dozen types of social ties - for 
example, with a spouse or partner, sibling, parent, close friend or fellow 
worker - were given nasal drops containing rhinoviruses.</p> 
<p>Susceptibility to colds was reduced as social support increased. Of those 
with three or less relationships, 62 per cent came down with a cold compared 
with only 35 per cent in those with six or more types of social support (J Am 
Med Assoc, 1997; 277: 1940-4).</p> 
<p>A repeat of that study (Health Psychol, 1998; 17: 214-23) evaluated stress 
more precisely (long term vs short term) as well as the severity of illness, 
and also measured blood levels of natural-killer (NK) cells, the immune system 
cells that combat infectious agents. Those stressed for more than a month had 
lower NK-cell activity and were 2.2 times more likely to develop colds. The 
biggest risk came with increased job stress.</p> 
<p>Stressed children have a greater susceptibility to URTI and show measurable 
decreases in mucosal immunity (J Psychosom Res, 1997; 43: 271-8). Depression is 
also strongly related to catching a cold (Epidemiology, 2001; 12: 345-9).</p> 
<p>Prescription drugs, like antibiotics, can also increase colds/ flu 
susceptibility. A substantial number of GPs still prescribe antibiotics for 
colds/flu, even though these drugs don&rsquo;t work against viruses (J Am Med 
Assoc, 1997; 278: 901-4; J Am Med Assoc, 1998; 279: 875-7).</p> 
<p>Australian doctors report that flucloxacillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, 
can cause cholestatic jaundice (Med J Aust, 1989; 151: 701-5), though its 
relation to the drug may go unrecognised because of a delayed onset (Lancet, 
1992; 339: 679). Older patients and those receiving flucloxacillin for more 
than two weeks are particularly at risk (BMJ, 1993; 306: 233-5).</p> 
<p>Newer combination antibiotics such as Septrin - trimethoprim and 
sulphamethoxazole, or co-trimoxazole - have been linked with skin rashes and 
blisters (Ind J Derm, 1982; 48: 207-8; Br J Dermatol, 1987; 116: 241-2; 
Dermatology, 1986; 172: 230-1), and a host of HIV-like symptoms, including 
anaemia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, numbness, convulsions, chills, 
fever, swollen glands, and ulcers in the mouth, eyes and urethra.</p> 
<p>Overuse of antibiotics also contributes to the emergence of 
&lsquo;superbugs&rsquo;, and can deplete the friendly gut bacteria needed to 
maintain good health and immunity. Clearly, when you take antibiotics, you are 
risking a trade-off of symptoms which may leave you more unhealthy than you 
were before.</p> 
<p>Over-the-counter madness<br>
If you do succumb to a cold or flu, there are 
literally hundreds of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies that claim to relieve 
cold symptoms, but most have been proven useless (J Am Med Assoc, 1993; 269: 
2258-63). The most popular varieties use a scattergun approach, mixing several 
different types of ingredients, often resulting in a variety of side-effects.
</p> 
<p>For instance: <br>
*Nasal sprays containing phenylephrine hydrochloride, 
oxymetazoline hydrochloride or xylometazoline hydrochloride may clear the nose 
initially but, after a few days, their continued use can cause a rebound 
effect, producing worse nasal congestion than before.</p> 
<p>* Oral decongestants stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and can 
increase blood pressure and pulse - risky for those with hypertension. They can 
cause heart rhythm disturbances, anxiety and a rebound effect. Perhaps the 
worst offender is phenylpropanolamine (PPA). In one study, this chemical 
increased the risk of stroke in women more than threefold (N Engl J Med, 2000; 
343: 1826-32). This was the last straw in more than a decade of studies of PPA. 
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked drug companies to stop 
marketing products containing PPA but, in the UK, it is still widely found in 
cold remedies.</p> 
<p>* Antihistamines may reduce a runny nose and sneezing, but have a minimal 
effect on other symptoms. They can have a sedating effect and are often added 
to multisymptom cold remedies because of their ability to counteract the 
stimulant effect of decongestants.</p> 
<p>* Cough suppressants such as guaifenesin (Robitussin) and dextromethorphan 
(NyQuil or Night Nurse) show no efficacy in suppressing coughs. The latter has 
been associated with liver damage and is used by teenagers to get a 'poor 
man&rsquo;s high'. Codeine also doesn&rsquo;t suppress coughs, but can result 
in constipation.</p> 
<p>* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, 
paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may in fact increase nasal symptoms. 
There is also evidence that aspirin decreases the antibody response in 
rhinovirus infections (J Am Med Assoc, 1975; 231: 1248-51; J Infect Dis, 1990; 
162: 1277-82). Furthermore, the influenza virus grows best at 34-35&ordm; C, 
but poorly - if at all - at temperatures greater than 37&ordm; C. So reducing 
fever with NSAIDs may simply prolong the agony of a cold or flu.</p> 
<p>To jab or not to jab?<br>
Predicting a flu epidemic is not an exact 
science, as was elegantly illustrated in 1976 when US officials, spurred on by 
illness among soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, predicted a swine flu epidemic 
as lethal as the great flu pandemic of 1918. In the event, rates of flu and 
pneumonia-related deaths in 1976 were at their lowest in years (MMWR, 1976; 25: 
391-2), much to the chagrin of the government, which had spent millions 
preparing a vaccine.</p> 
<p>As flu can be caused by any of hundreds of strains of myxovirus, which 
mutate more or less constantly, vaccination amounts to a kind of biological 
Russian roulette. Even if the vaccine is for the right strain of myxovirus, for 
reasons not yet fully understood, you may not respond by producing anti-bodies 
to it. One study found that 30-40 per cent of elderly people do not respond to 
vaccination (Hum Immunol, 1994; 40: 202-9), and even if an immune response 
occurs, there is doubt as to whether this reduces the incidence of influenza 
(Vaccine, 1994; 12: 1185-9).</p> 
<p>Studies into the efficacy of the flu vaccine show mixed results 
(Gerontology, 1995; 41: 3-10), and questions remain as to whether the 
inactivated virus used in the vaccine can truly provide complete protection 
(Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 1995; 108: 318-20).</p> 
<p>Then there are the side-effects. While authorities say these are rare, this 
is cold comfort if you are among those affected. The ill-fated swine flu 
vaccine resulted in a rise of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, a type of 
paralysis (Am J Epidemiol, 1979; 110: 105-23). In one UK study, around one in 
12 patients said the flu vaccine was a trigger for asthma attacks (Lancet, 
1998; 351: 326-31). Optic neuritis and permanent blindness, vasculitis and 
joint problems, reversible paralysis and myelopathy have also been reported (Am 
J Ophthalmol, 1997; 124: 703-4; J Rheumatol, 1997; 24: 1198-202; Ned Tijd 
Geneeskunde, 1995; 139: 2152-4; Muscle Nerve, 1995; 18: 1199-201).</p> 
<p>Reviews of the benefits of vaccines in healthy adults have shown that these 
are negligible, sucessfully reducing the number of virus carriers (as shown by 
blood tests), but not of those who actually develop the flu (Cochrane Database 
Syst Rev, 2000; [2]: CD001269; Vaccine, 2000; 18: 957-1030).</p> 
<p>Vitamin C, zinc and Echinacea <br>
Research shows that most of us treat 
colds and flu at home (J Fam Pract, 1998; 47: 366-9). Decades of research have 
gone into vitamin supplementation and immunity, and many nutrients have proved 
to be important in shoring up our immune defences (see box below).</p> 
<p>The most popular of these are vitamin C and zinc, although opinion varies 
regarding their true effectiveness. In the 1970s, Linus Pauling&rsquo;s review 
of the evidence concluded that large doses of vitamin C prevented colds and 
alleviated symptoms (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1971; 68: 2678-81).</p> 
<p>Since that time, however, the efficacy of vitamin C has been hotly debated. 
A 1975 analysis by Thomas Chalmers concluded that the case for vitamin C had 
&ldquo;questionable validity&rdquo; (Am J Med, 1975; 58: 532-6), but a recent 
analysis of the report suggests that his analysis was seriously flawed (J Am 
Coll Nutr, 1995; 14; 116-23).</p> 
<p>It is now generally accepted that a dose of 1-8 g of vitamin C daily can 
decrease the severity of cold symptoms by an average of 23 per cent and reduce 
the duration of illness by nearly half (Scand J Infect Dis, 1994; 26: 1-6; Br J 
Nutr, 1992; 67: 3-16).</p> 
<p>More recent reviews of the evidence say that, while vitamin C can alleviate 
cold symptoms, taking large doses is not preventative (Cochrane Database Syst 
Rev, 2000; [2]: CD000980). However, some groups may benefit from regular 
supplementation, such as athletes under heavy physical stress (Int J Sport Med, 
1996; 17: 379-83). One review suggests a reduction in cold incidence of up to 
50 per cent with regular vitamin C use (Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 1999; 3: 756-61).
</p> 
<p>Zinc has long been promoted as a remedy and preventative for colds and flu. 
In one study, a nasal gel containing zinc significantly shortened the duration 
of a cold if taken within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms (Ear Nose Throat J, 
2000; 79: 778-80, 782).</p> 
<p>However, taken as a whole, the evidence for the efficacy of zinc lozenges 
is inconclusive (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2000 [2]: CD001364; J Nutr, 2000; 
130 [5S Suppl]: 1512S-5S). The first study of zinc lozenges found a seven-day 
reduction in colds duration with zinc (Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1984; 25: 
20-4). Such results piqued drug company interest and, by the end of the1980s, 
five more studies had been carried out. However, only one of these showed zinc 
to have any effect. But then, in 1996, another study suggested that zinc 
lozenges were effective against cold symptoms (Ann Intern Med, 1996; 125: 
81-8), thus launching zinc back on the road to popularity.</p> 
<p>One trial of zinc lozenges (12.8 mg) found that patients taking one every 
two to three hours early in the course of a cold reduced the duration and 
severity of their symptoms, especially cough (Ann Intern Med, 2000; 133: 
245-52).</p> 
<p>But another randomised double-blind trial of 249 children (total daily dose 
of 50-60 mg) found no difference between zinc lozenges and placebo (J Am Med 
Assoc, 1998; 279: 1962-7). More recently, a trial of both zinc gluconate and 
zinc acetate concluded that neither had much effect on cold symptoms (Clin 
Infect Dis, 2000; 31: 1202-8).</p> 
<p>So far, at least 10 double-blind trials have evaluated zinc lozenges for 
treating the common cold. Half have shown efficacy and half have not, results 
which may be due to methodological differences. Trials that began therapy 
shortly after onset of symptoms, used zinc gluconate or glycine-sweetened zinc 
gluconate and gave multiple daily zinc doses of 13-23 mg per dose found zinc to 
be effective. Most of the negative trials, on the other hand, varied from this 
protocol in one way or another.</p> 
<p>Echinacea, one of the best-selling OTC herbals, has also shown mixed 
efficacy. German researchers gave the liquid root extract of either E. purpurea 
or E. angustifolia, two of the most popular types, or placebo to 302 healthy 
volunteers in a double-blind randomised trial. Results showed that both types 
of Echinacea were only slightly more effective than the placebo in preventing 
colds over a 12-week period, although participants taking the herb reported 
feeling better than those taking placebo. The authors concluded that, at best, 
Echinacea may reduce the risk of catching a cold by about 10-20 per cent (Arch 
Fam Med, 1998; 7: 541-5).</p> 
<p>Other studies, however, have shown that Echinacea can relieve symptoms, 
reducing both the severity and duration of a cold (Arzneim Forsch, 2001; 51: 
563-8; Arch Fam Med, 1998; 7: 541-5). One trial in Sweden looked at 246 healthy 
adults who caught a cold and took an E. purpurea preparation or placebo. The 
subjects took two tablets three times a day for seven days or until they felt 
better. The Echinacea preparations were significantly more effective than the 
placebo (Phytomedicine, 1999; 6: 1-6).</p> 
<p>The key to these and other remedies may be to treat at the first signs of 
cold or flu. A recent review of 13 trials of Echinacea in the treatment and 
prevention of colds concluded that, while it may not prevent colds, early 
treatment could be beneficial for relieving symptoms (J Fam Pract, 1999; 48: 
628-35). It also noted that Echinacea preparations vary widely in composition.
</p> 
<p>When colds or flu strikes, we all hope for a magic bullet to make things 
right, but most of the methods we use are still shots in the dark. Traditional 
approaches - usually involving rest, liquids and keeping warm - may not be 
glamorous but, in the end, appear to be effective, less prone to adverse 
effects and less expensive.</p>

What our readers and members say about WDDTY Two months ago I could 
barely walk more than 50 yards or stand in the queue at the Post Office. 
Chronic lower back pain was the problem...now, thanks to you, I ramble and 
cycle miles and miles without pain. - R.P., Norwich I was told I had glaucoma 
and was going blind. I developed a diet and supplement programme based on your 
information, and two months later I had my eyes examined again, and there was 
no sign of glaucoma any more. - G.R., Edinburgh My husband was given three 
months to live two years ago due to prostate cancer. By reading the information 
you provide, I contacted the right people and he started an alternative 
therapy. It succeeded and he was later told that he was clear of cancer. Thank 
you for being you. - M.R., Dyfed Instead of suffering from asthma, unwillingly 
forced into the last-ditch resort of taking steroids in order to have any sort 
of livable life, I am virtually free of it and, to boot, have lost a surplus 
two stone. This is all attributable to your informative publications. - M.B., 
Cornwall Recently my mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. I cannot 
tell you how encouraging your newsletter was to the whole family...she is 
faring well and confident she is making the right decisions thanks to your 
timely advice. - J.B., Jersey Several years ago I was diagnosed with multiple 
sclerosis...a chance discussion put me on the track of your publication, which 
linked MS-type symptoms with the Pill I&rsquo;d been taking. Had I listened to 
my GP and neurologist I would probably be in a wheelchair. Thank you for saving 
my life. - D.J., Norfolk <br>
