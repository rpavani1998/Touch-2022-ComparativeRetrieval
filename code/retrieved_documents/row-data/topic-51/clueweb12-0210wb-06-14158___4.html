<li>Tylenol (calpol) depletes glutathione<br>
 Numerous studies document that 
tylenol depletes glutathione, which is a crucial ingredient for immunity and 
for detoxification including removal of mercury after vaccines. Sadly, the 
parents whose kids were having a vaccination reaction and, at doc's or nurse's 
suggestion, gave tylenol were thereby exacerbating adverse effects.

<h2>Fever &amp; Seizures</h2> It is the rapid rise or fall in temperature that 
causes the seizures/fits in some susceptible children so by the time you are 
aware of the fever they will either have seized/fitted or not. Indeed giving 
Tyelenol/Calpol and lowering temperature rapidly could cause the convulsions.
<p> </p>
<p> Even if a child does have a seizure/fit, there is no evidence that it 
causes any long term damage, it is just an unpleasant symptom, particularly for 
the paren</p>

<li><b>Feverish illness in children - Assessment and initial management in 
children younger than 5 years Clinical Guideline, May 2007, Funded to produce 
guidelines for the NHS by NICE (UK)
<p> The first investigated the hypothesis that paracetamol and ibuprofen, used 
prophylactically, will reduce the incidence of febrile convulsions across a 
wide variety of conditions. It found no evidence that the prophylactic use of 
antipyretics has any effect in reducing the incidence of febrile convulsions. 
The second review assessed 12 studies of the effects of paracetamol for 
treating children in relation to fever clearance time, febrile convulsions and 
resolution of associated symptoms. It also found no evidence that the use of 
prophylactic paracetamol influenced the risk of febrile convulsions.</p>
<p> Evidence summary<br>
 Limited evidence was found regarding the use of 
antipyretic medications in the promotion of wellbeing, activity, eating and 
drinking, and no evidence of cost-effectiveness. One study suggested that 
parents could identify some improvement in activity and alertness after the 
administration of paracetamol, but not in mood, comfort, appetite or fluid 
intake. There is no evidence that the use of antipyretic agents reduces the 
incidence of febrile convulsions.</p>
<p> GDG translation The GDG noted that, from the evidence, antipyretic agents 
do not appear to be effective in the prevention of febrile convulsions. There 
is very limited evidence regarding the effect of paracetamol on activity or 
other areas contained within the clinical question, which showed inconsistent 
effects.</p>

<h2>Fever Charts</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>from Stanford Childrens Hospital site, in California. (URL no longer 
works) It shows that a fever must be very high before causing damage
<p> Your child probably has an early virus infection. Most fevers are good for 
children and help the body fight infection. Use the following definitions to 
help put your child's level of fever into perspective:<br>
 100-102&deg;F (37.8 
- 39&deg;C) -- low grade fevers and beneficial<br>
 102-104&deg;F (39 - 
40&deg;C) -- moderate grade fevers and beneficial<br>
 Above 104&deg;F 
(40&deg;C) -- high fevers and cause discomfort, but harmless<br>
 Above 
105&deg;F (40.6&deg;C) -- higher risk of bacterial infections<br>
 Above 
107&deg;F (41.7&deg;C) -- the fever itself can be harmful<br>

<li>Dutch (Netherlands) Guidelines:<br>
 Just so everyone can put the fever 
issue in perspective. Not all of the world panics at fever.............
<p> Below is a (quick) translation, by one of my list members, of the official 
policy guidelines for Dutch family doctors in case of fever in children, given 
by their organisation and published on internet.</p>
<p> I have added the Fahrenheit degrees</p>
<p> Official guidelines for Dutch family doctors in case of fever in children:
<br> - A realistic notion about fever will make it more easy for parents to 
deal with children having fever.<br>
 - In general, fever does not need 
treatment.<br>
 - Actively lowering the body temperature is not neccessary. 
Applying cold compresses and cold sponging of the child is not meaningful.<br>
 
- In principle, no antipyretics are given. Antipyretics do not fight the 
disease and at best will make the child feel a bit better.<br>
 - Fever is 
qualified as a rectal temperature above 38 degrees C. (100.4 degree Fahrenheit)
<br> -There are no injurious effects of fever below 41.7 degrees C. (107.06 
degree Fahrenheit)<br>
 - Fever is a useful bodily reaction. If the heat is 
allowed to drain away, fever will not rise above 41.7 degrees C. (107.06 degree 
Fahrenheit)<br>
 - The increase of the body temperature seems to be important 
in fighting the disease.<br>
 - If the fever is not treated, this does not mean 
the temperature will keep rising.<br>
 - The main reason for taking the 
temperature is knowing whether or not there is a fever.<br>
 - There is no use 
in measuring each change. It is sufficient to take the temperature once a day.
<br> - Parents should not wake their child to take the temperature.<br>
 - 
Temperature should be measured per rectum. Other ways are not reliable.<br>
 - 
Observing the child and registering changes in the childs behaviour are more 
important than frequently measuring the temperature.<br>
 - The extent to which 
the child is sick is far more important than the temperature of the fever.</p>

<h2>Homeopathic Treatment of a Child with Fever</h2> Homeopathy works very 
well in treating an ill child with a fever. We aren't treating the fever. We 
aren't trying to make the fever go down. We are treating the child looking at 
all the symptoms present including the fever. The remedy helps the child to 
heal and the fever goes when the healing happens and the fever is no longer 
needed
<p> Find the ONE remedy that matches the symptom picture best. If these lists 
aren't complete enough, may need to consult a homeopath, take one of my 
classes, or find other remedy lists</p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fevers In Children do NOT go by her dosage information - use the 
information I post at the end of this section as to how to give a remedy for a 
minor acute illness or first aid
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Fevers (Homeopathic Remedies)<br>
 He errs on the side of caution in the 
paragraphs in the first part of the page. See above for info on that. He is way 
to cautious in my opinion here - &quot;Any fever that is over 101 F for more 
than a sort period of time needs to be assessed by a medical professional. Any 
fever that rises suddenly to high temperatures, such 103 to 104, needs 
immediate professional help, as this can be a sign of a serious condition. The 
remedies given here are for simple, uncomplicated fever, as any other type of 
fever may need professional attention.&quot;
<p> I don't agree that 103 or 104 needs professional help unless prolonged 
fever and no progress being made or other serious symptoms. You have to make 
your own decision on that.</p>
<p> I post this information for the remedy pictures he lists</p>
<p> Again, find the one remedy that matches the symptom picture the best, 
especially paying attention to the emotional state of the child while ill</p>
<p> </p></li> </ul> 
<p> </p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<h2>Administering Homeopathic Remedies</h2> Put your dry pillules, tablets, in 
water to administer - see below
<p> Best not to take them dry. The vital force of the body does better if you 
put them in water and then raise the potency a little each time. The vital 
force doesn't do as well with the same potency over and over and that is the 
way you would do it if you used them dry</p>
<p> PRINT this out and keep handy with your remedies.</p>
<p> Generally I suggest you use 30C (unless you have completed a course with 
me, then I suggest 200C). Do not treat for chronic or recurring things on your 
own or with 30C.</p>
<p> DO NOT go by what is on the bottle (heaven only knows why fda or whatever 
makes them say that stuff)</p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>You can give just a dry pillule, but it appears to work better to give in 
water (aqueous solution) and be able to succuss it between doses - but in a 
pinch, give as dry. (for an infant crush if possible or just put in a little 
water in a cup and let melt and then give.) But best to give in the way I 
describe below.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>BEST to give as an aqueous solution - one or two pillules/tablets in water
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Put ONE pillule or tablet in 6 oz of water (use purified, filtered water 
if possible) in a water bottle used only for this
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Let dissolve or sit for at least 5 minutes (the remedy coats the pillule 
which is sucrose or the tablet which is lactose)
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Shake just a little 
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Take one teaspoon out of water bottle and give to the person. Have person 
hold in their mouth for a few seconds if possible.
<p>Wait. </p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Use a plastic spoon (if you use a metal spoon, save it for use only for 
this person while being treated. After person well and not using it any longer, 
boil it in water for 5 minutes before it is washed and used for other things
<p> </p></li> 
<li>You basically give 1 dose of 1 remedy and wait........ 
<ul> 
<li> a. If improvement, don't give anymore
<p> </p></li> 
<li> b. If improvement and then same symptoms come back - give another dose of 
same
<ul> 
<li> 1. to give another dose, take the water bottle you have and succuss it - 
this is strong downward thrusts from about 2 feet up - like a judge hitting a 
gavel do this 10 times on a book or something (you are succussing to slight 
raise the potency of what you have started with - it seems that the vital force 
does better with a little higher potency each time, than the same potency)</li> 
<li> 2. give another teaspoon out of this </li> 
<li> 3. if using a cup and not a water bottle - better to use water bottle 
though - stir briskly 10 times and give one teaspoon</li> </ul>
<p> </p></li> 
<li> c. If improvement and new symptoms that are really a problem and body 
can't deal with itself - research and find what the new remedy should be (will 
sometimes use one remedy and shift things and then need a different to finish 
up)
<p> </p></li> 
<li> d. If no improvement on one dose of 30c in water, repeat it in 20-30 
minutes; if no improvement on one dose if 200c in water, repeat it in 1 hour 
can do this 2 or 3 times with 200C or 30C. if no improvement after that 
probably wrong remedy
<p> </p></li> </ul> </li> 
<li> Improvement you may see first is in mental/emotional symptoms, or sleep, 
or general well being, or thirst or appetite - then the physical symptoms may 
improve later If you are using 6X or something, may have to repeat oftener than 
a 30 C as the energy 'gets used up', in a way.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> If you get near the end of the bottle, keep at least one teaspoon in 
there and add 6 ozs more of water to keep it going, as you have been raising 
the potency each time and don't want to start over. Mostly you will never get 
to this point as you will only be repeating 3 or 4 times. Don't need to 
refrigerate unless keeping overnight and usually this will not be the case.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Throw all away at the end once treatment is over or not needing this 
remedy for this illness any longer</li> </ul>
