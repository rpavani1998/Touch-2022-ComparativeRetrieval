<h2>Asthma in children and adolescents</h2> 
<h3>Highlights</h3> 
<p><strong>FDA Advisories</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Leukotriene antagonist drugs, which include montelukast (Singulair), 
zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo), may be associated with mood and 
psychiatric side effects including agitation, aggression, insomnia, and 
suicidal behavior. If you experience any of these symptoms, your doctor may 
recommend discontinuing the drug.</li> 
<li>Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are medications used for preventing an 
asthma attack (not for treating symptoms). The FDA advises that they should 
only be used in combination with an asthma controller medication, such as an 
inhaled corticosteroid. Salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair) and 
formoterol-budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination products. These 
medications should be used for the shortest time possible, and should only be 
used by patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by other medications.
</li> 
<li>The FDA is reviewing whether omalizumab (Xolair) may be associated with 
increased risk for heart and vascular problems (ischemic heart disease, 
arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and blood 
clots).</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Asthma Guidelines</strong> </p> 
<p>The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 
guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma recommend:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Assessment and Monitoring</em>. Doctors should use multiple measures 
to determine a patient&rsquo;s current condition and future risk for worsening 
of condition. Even patients who show few daily effects of asthma may be in 
danger of sudden worsening of symptoms.</li> 
<li><em>Patient Education</em>. Patients should be taught skills to 
self-monitor and manage asthma. Doctors should give patients a written asthma 
action plan, which includes information on daily treatment and ways to 
recognize worsening asthma.</li> 
<li><em>Control of Environmental Factors and Other Asthma Triggers</em>. The 
guidelines outline new approaches for reducing exposure to allergens. They also 
address how treating co-existing chronic conditions (rhinitis, sinusitis, 
gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity) can help improve asthma control.</li> 
<li><em>Medications</em>. The NAEPP specifies different treatment plans for 
children based on three age groups: 0 - 4 years, 5 - 11 years, and 12 years and 
older. A stepwise approach is recommended where medication types and doses are 
increased or decreased based on the level of asthma control.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
<p>The word <em>asthma</em> originates from an ancient Greek word meaning 
panting. Essentially, asthma is an inflammatory lung condition that makes it 
difficult to breathe properly.</p> 
<p>When any people inhale, the air travels through the following structures: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Air passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways 
called<em>bronchi</em> and then <i>bronchioles</i>. The lungs contain millions 
of these airways.</li> 
<li>All bronchioles lead to <i>alveoli</i>, which are microscopic sacs where 
oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled.</li> </ul>  The major 
features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveoli. 
The alveoli are the microscopic sacs lined by tiny blood vessels that take in 
oxygen and give up carbon dioxide.<br>

<p>Asthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when 
stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to 
be two specific responses:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The <i>hyperreactive</i> response (also called hyperresponsiveness) </li> 
<li>The <i>inflammatory</i> response</li> </ul> 
<p>These actions in the airway cause coughing, wheezing, and shortness of 
breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.</p> 
<h4>Hyperreactive Response</h4> 
<p>In the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways constrict and 
narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other irritants. Airways 
in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to allergens or 
irritants but there are major differences in the hyperreactive response that 
occurs in people with asthma:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When people <i>without</i> asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways 
relax and open in order to rid the lungs of the irritant.</li> 
<li>When people <i>with</i> asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their 
airways do not relax but instead narrow, causing the patients to pant for 
breath. Smooth muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, 
perhaps a deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from 
relaxing. And, during an asthma attack the airways narrow, making breathing 
difficult.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Inflammatory Response</h4> 
<p>The hyperreactive stage is followed by the <i>inflammatory</i> response, 
which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The immune system responds to allergens or other environmental triggers by 
delivering white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.</li> 
<li>These so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, fill with 
fluid, and produce a thick sticky mucus.</li> 
<li>This combination results in wheezing, breathlessness, an inability to 
exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>Inflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with 
asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the 
disease.</p> 
<h3>Causes</h3> 
<p>The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Asthma is most likely caused by a 
combination of genetic (inherited) factors and environmental triggers (such as 
allergens and infections). Asthma tends to run in families, so children whose 
parents have asthma are more likely to develop it themselves.</p> 
<h4>The Allergic Response (Allergens)</h4> 
<p>Asthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a 
strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also 
have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also 
at greater risk for developing asthma as adults. However, only a minority of 
children with allergies have asthma.</p> 
<p>In people with allergies, the immune system overreacts to exposure to 
allergens. Allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling certain substances 
(allergens) such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that 
contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.</li> 
<li>Animal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be 
carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who 
already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for 
developing such allergies later on.</li> 
<li>Molds. </li> 
<li>Cockroaches. Cockroach dust is a major trigger and may reduce lung 
function even in people without a history of asthma.</li> 
<li>Pollen, from plants.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Environmental Factors (Irritants)</h4> 
<p>An asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the 
lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, 
the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Smoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway 
responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This 
extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to 
have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and 
increases their baby's risks for asthma</li> 
<li>Food allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food 
allergies. Some research suggests that peanut and milk allergies may increase 
asthma severity.</li> 
<li>Indoor chemicals. Chemicals used in household cleaning products and 
furniture materials can be asthma triggers.</li> 
<li>Air pollution. Fossil fuels and chemicals that contribute to air pollution 
may worsen asthma symptoms.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Infections</h4> 
<p>The role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very 
complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the 
most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early 
respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.
</p> 
<p>Studies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes 
of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is associated with the development of 
asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate 
that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are 
at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.</p> 
<p>Common respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the 
rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. 
More likely, these viruses do not directly cause asthma, but worsen asthma in 
children who already have it. Rhinovirus is the most common infection 
associated with asthma attacks.</p> 
<p>Research indicates that children who have viral-induced wheezing during 
infancy may be at increased risk for later development of asthma. However, many 
children outgrow attacks of intermittent wheezing.</p> 
<h3>Risk Factors</h3> 
<p>Asthma affects about 7 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has 
dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed 
and developing countries. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. 
About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% 
of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.</p> 
<h4>Gender</h4> 
<p>Among younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in 
girls, but after puberty it is more common in girls.</p> 
<h4>Race and Ethnicity</h4> 
<p>African-American children have significantly higher rates of asthma than 
Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of 
minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children. 
Ethnicity and genetics, however, are less likely to play a role in these 
differences than socioeconomic differences, such as having less access to 
optimal health care, and greater likelihood of living in an urban area. 
Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma.</p> 
<h4>Issues Surrounding Birth</h4> 
<p>A variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk 
for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Low Birth Weight.</i> Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk 
for lung problems and asthma.</li> 
<li><i>Winter Birth.</i> Children born in the winter may have a greater risk 
for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the 
year.</li> 
<li><i>Breastfeeding.</i> Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby&rsquo;s first 3 
months of life may help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their 
early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later 
childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 6 
months.</li> 
<li><i>Complications of Pregnancy.</i> Complications of pregnancy, 
specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth 
hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth 
of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Obesity</h4> 
<p>There is a strong association between obesity and asthma. People who are 
overweight (body mass index greater than 25) also have more difficulty getting 
their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma 
or shortness of breath helps reduce airway obstruction and improve lung 
function. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #53: Weight 
control and diet.]. </p> 
<h4>Other Risk Factors</h4> 
<p><i>GERD.</i> At least half of patients with asthma also have 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not 
entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to 
common factors. Treating GERD does not appear to improve asthma control. [For 
more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #85: Heartburn and 
gastroesophageal reflux disease.] </p> 
<p><em>Aspirin-Induced Asthma</em>. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a 
condition in which asthma gets worse after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AIA often develops after a viral infection. 
It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition, associated with many 
asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible 
for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal 
congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the 
nasal passages.</p> 
<p>Patients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and other 
NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).</p> 
<h3>Prognosis</h3> 
<p>Asthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 
15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger 
than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.</p> 
<h4>Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma</h4> 
<p>Asthma death rates have steadily declined and asthma is now only rarely 
fatal in children Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since 
asthma deaths are largely preventable.</p> 
<p>Factors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Previous life-threatening episodes of asthma </li> 
<li>Two or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the 
past year</li> 
<li>Using two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month </li> 
<li>Lack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the 
higher fatalities rates in minority children.)</li> 
<li>Significant behavioral or psychosocial problems </li> 
<li>Underestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat
</li> </ul> 
<p>African-American children have more than six times the death rate of 
Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic 
children also have a higher risk.</p> 
<h4>Long-Term Outlook</h4> 
<p>Asthma generally improves as children get older, although most school-age 
children with persistent asthma will still experience symptoms through 
adolescence. Some children outgrow their asthma by adulthood. In general, the 
more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will 
persist.</p> 
<p>Severe asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring 
in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest when asthma strikes 
children in their first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any 
significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop 
mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to 
living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as 
healthy children in virtually all areas of life.</p> 
<h3>Symptoms</h3> 
<p>In children with asthmatic symptoms, it is important to first consider as a 
possible cause inhaled foreign objects such as peanuts; viral infections such 
as croup; and bacterial infections, which may be accompanied by high fever and 
progress rapidly. Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections 
should be checked for asthma.</p> 
<h4>Typical Asthma Symptoms</h4> 
<p>The classic symptoms of an asthma attack include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wheezing is nearly always present during an attack. Wheezing is a 
whistling sound caused by the narrowed airways.</li> 
<li>Shortness of breath (<i>dyspnea</i>). Shortness of breath is a major 
source of distress in patients with asthma.</li> 
<li>Coughing. In some people, the first (or only) symptom of asthma is a dry 
cough. The cough may be worse at night.</li> 
<li>Chest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other 
symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.</li> 
<li>Rapid heart rate </li> 
<li>Sweating</li> </ul> 
<p>Any of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure 
to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.</p> 
<p>The end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, 
stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to 
weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, 
however, because it usually causes relapse.)</p> 
<h4>Symptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack</h4> 
<p>The following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>As the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often 
becomes shallow.</li> 
<li>Lacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish. </li> 
<li>The flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in. </li> 
<li>The patient may begin to lose consciousness.</li> </ul> 
<p>Asthma often progresses very slowly but it may sometimes develop to a fatal 
or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when 
an attack will become very serious.</p> 
<h4>Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)</h4> 
<p>Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise 
triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally 
occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold 
dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, 
then gradually resolve.</p> 
<p>EIA is triggered <i>only</i> by exercise and is distinct from ordinary 
allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, 
as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) 
People who have only EIA do not need long-term maintenance therapy.</p> <br>

<br> Click the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma. 
<h4>Nocturnal Asthma</h4> 
<p>Asthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of 
patients with asthma. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 a.m. Nighttime 
attacks may indicate poor asthma control.</p> 
<h3>Diagnosis</h3> 
<h4>Pulmonary Function Tests</h4> 
<p>If symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor 
will usually perform tests known as<i>pulmonary function tests</i> to confirm 
the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.</p> 
<p>Using a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and 
exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Vital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or 
exhaled.</li> 
<li>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the 
maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.</li> 
<li>Forced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 
second.</li> </ul> 
<p>If the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on 
the results, the doctor will take the following steps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a 
bronchodilator medication. This drug is used in asthma to open the air 
passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more 
normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma 
is strongly suspected.</li> 
<li>If measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is 
still suspected, the doctor may perform a<em>challenge test</em><em>.</em> It 
involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually 
increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Allergy Tests</h4> 
<p>The patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a 
specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests 
help diagnose for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people 
with year-round asthma.</p>  One of the most common methods of allergy testing 
is the scratch test or skin prick test. The test involves placing a small 
amount of the suspected allergy-causing substance (allergen) on the skin 
(usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back), then scratching or pricking the 
skin so that the allergen is introduced under the skin surface. The skin is 
observed closely for signs of a reaction, which usually includes swelling and 
redness of the site. With this test, several suspected allergens can be tested 
at the same time, and results are usually available within about 20 minutes.<br>
<h3>Treatment</h3> 
<h4>General Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma</h4> 
<p>While medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, 
appropriate management of asthma involves much more:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Identifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers </li> 
<li>Following appropriate drug treatments </li> 
<li>Home monitoring performed by either patient or family </li> 
<li>Good communication between the doctor and patient </li> 
<li>Needed psychosocial support </li> 
<li>Treatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)</li> </ul>
<p>The severity of asthma is classified into four groups: Intermittent, Mild 
Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components 
of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Symptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout 
the day</li> 
<li>Nighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly </li> 
<li>Short-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or 
fewer days per week to several times per day</li> 
<li>Interference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited 
</li> 
<li>Lung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary 
function testing at the doctor's office</li> 
<li>Number of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, 
ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.</li> </ul> 
<p>Once patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a 
recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age 
groupings:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>4 years old or younger </li> 
<li>5 - 11 years old </li> 
<li>12 years or older</li> </ul> 
<h4>Treating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease</h4> 
<p>Medications for asthma fall into two categories: </p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Rescue (Quick-Relief) Medications.</i> Medications that open the 
airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate 
or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic 
agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include 
corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and 
anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are 
useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications 
indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.</li> 
<li><i>Long-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications.</i> Long-term control 
medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory 
response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the 
overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For children over age 
5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, doctors recommend inhaled 
corticosteroids, with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.
</li> </ul> 
<p>The goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness 
with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the 
frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the 
frequency and severity of their children&rsquo;s asthma attacks by 
understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling 
the disease over time.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between 
medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for 
long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse 
their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The 
overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids 
can lead to permanent lung damage.</p> 
<p>These are the signs of well-controlled asthma: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma symptoms occur twice a week or less </li> 
<li>Rescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less </li> 
<li>Symptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening </li> 
<li>Symptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities </li> 
<li>Peak flow meter readings are normal or the patient&rsquo;s personal best 
</li> 
<li>Both the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled
</li> </ul> 
<h4>Steps for Treating Asthma</h4> 
<p>A stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and 
dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on a 
patient&rsquo;s age and asthma severity, there are specific recommendations 
regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. 
Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other 
conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations 
based on a specific patient.</p> 
<p>In choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual 
patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this 
include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to 
different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks 
of starting therapy to assess response.</p> 
<p>Key points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Long-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four or 
more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have 
some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be 
considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.
</li> 
<li>Nebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer 
medications to children this age.</li> 
<li>Only certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are 
recommended for these children.</li> 
<li>Close follow-up is recommended </li> 
<li>Avoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Key points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Participation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged. </li>
<li>Schools, child care, and camps should all have a copy of the asthma action 
plan.</li> 
<li>Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. 
Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies 
that may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.</li> 
<li>Avoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are 
recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.</p> 
<h4>Devices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs</h4> 
<p>Most asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or 
nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient 
carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. 
Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although 
newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the 
metered-dose inhaler (MDI), dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.</p> 
<p><i>Metered-Dose Inhaler.</i> The standard device for administering any 
asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly 
when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the 
lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a 
holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) 
MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient 
carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some 
patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others 
may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.</p> 
<p>The spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient 
additional time to inhale. In addition, MDIs can continue to deliver propellant 
even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and 
throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Dry Powder Inhalers.</i> Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered 
form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Some 
patients find that they are easier to manage than MDIs. Humidity or extreme 
temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in 
humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures 
(glove compartments during summer months).</p> 
<p>Dry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their 
mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a 
fluoride toothpaste.</p> 
<p><i>Nebulizers.</i> A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of 
medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger 
than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the 
MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. 
Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large 
amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side 
effects.</p> 
<p>Children who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has 
been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of 
symptoms than inhalers. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents 
should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which 
actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than 
nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. 
Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI 
works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable 
at home.</p> <br>

the use of a nebulizer. 
<h4>Non-Medical Treatment Strategies</h4> 
<p>Asthma can trigger a difficult emotional-physical cycle: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Breathlessness and wheezing incite a fear of suffocation and death, even 
in very small children.</li> 
<li>This anxiety produces further constriction on the muscles surrounding the 
airways, which makes breathing even more difficult.</li> </ul> 
<p>Caregivers must first focus on reducing their own anxiety, which can 
heighten a child's own fears. The next step is to help the child relax. One 
method for this is as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The child sits comfortably, bending slight forward with the eyes closed. 
</li> 
<li>The hands are placed gently over the navel. </li> 
<li>The child is then told to pretend the stomach is a balloon. </li> 
<li>The &quot;balloon&quot; must be &quot;blown up&quot; by inhalation, not 
exhalation. The child can tell if this working because the hands will move 
slightly apart.</li> 
<li>When the child breathes out, the &quot;balloon&quot; will be made flat.
</li> </ul> 
<p>This exercise both relaxes the child and discourages shallow, oxygen-poor 
breathing. Massaging the child in gentle circles on the chest is relaxing and 
may also loosen mucus.</p> 
<p>Other recommendations include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>A child may find relief by lying stomach-down on several pillows so that 
the head is slightly lower than the chest while the caregiver gently pats the 
back between the shoulder blades.</li> 
<li>Warm liquids, such as soup or hot cider, are effective in loosening mucus 
and may also relax bronchial muscles. Cold fluids, like cold air, should be 
avoided.</li> 
<li>Overhydration (too much liquid) can be harmful, however, so these drinks 
should not be forced on the child.</li> 
<li>Warm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma 
attacks.</li> </ul> 
<p>Visits by home health care nurses or social workers may help if the family 
is having trouble managing the asthma and following prescribed treatments. 
Often, having the home evaluated for triggers can be very helpful.</p> 
<h3>Quick-Relief Medications</h3> 
<p>These medications quickly control acute asthma attacks. </p> 
<h4>Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h4> 
<p>Beta2-agonists serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted 
airways during an acute asthma attack. A short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, 
taken as needed, is often the only medication used by children with chronic 
mild asthma.</p> 
<p>Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the U.S., is the 
standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar beta2-agonists 
are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, and Medihaler-Iso), metaproterenol 
(Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, and 
Bricanyl), levalbuterol (Xopenex), and bitolterol (Tornalate).</p> 
<p>Short-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation 
and are effective for 3 - 6 hours. They relieve the symptoms of acute attacks, 
but they do not control the underlying inflammation. If asthma continues to 
worsen with the use of these drugs, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids or 
other drugs to treat underlying inflammation.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects of Beta2-Agonists.</i> Side effects of all beta2-agonists 
may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anxiety </li> 
<li>Tremor </li> 
<li>Restlessness </li> 
<li>Headache </li> 
<li>Fast and irregular heartbeats. Notify a doctor immediately if this side 
effect occurs.</li> 
<li>Children with diabetes or a history of seizures should take these drugs 
with caution.</li> 
<li>Beta2-agonists have serious interactions with certain drugs; parents 
should tell the doctor about any other medications their child is taking.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><i>Loss of Effectiveness and Overdose.</i> Short-acting beta2-agonists 
become less effective when taken regularly over time, which increases the risk 
for overuse. Overdose can be serious and in rare cases even life threatening.
</p> 
<h4>Anticholinergic Drugs</h4> 
<p>Two inhaled drugs, ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and tiotropium (Spiriva), 
act as bronchodilators over time. Neither is highly beneficial for acute asthma 
attacks. Moreover, the drugs are not approved specifically for asthma. Some 
parents, however, report these drugs are helpful for treating wheezing in 
infants. The drugs are also sometimes used in the emergency room to treat 
children with severe asthma to enhance the effects of intravenous 
beta2-agonists.</p> 
<h4>Oral Corticosteroids</h4> 
<p>Common oral corticosteroids include prednisone/prednisolone, dexamethasone, 
methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone. They reduce inflammation very 
effectively. They are most commonly prescribed for asthma flareups that do not 
respond to inhaler medications. Doctors may provide a written prescription for 
patients to keep on hand, with specific instructions about when to fill it. 
Usually, the dosage starts out higher and is gradually reduced over a 5 - 7 day 
period. Prolonged use of oral steroids has widespread and sometimes serious 
side effects, so they are not generally give to children for longer than 5 - 7 
days.</p> 
<p>[For more information, see <em>In-Depth Report</em> #4: Asthma in adults.] 
</p> 
<h3>Long-Term Relief Medications</h3> 
<p>These medications are taken on a regular basis to prevent asthma attacks 
and control chronic symptoms.</p> 
<h4>Inhaled Corticosteroids</h4> 
<p>Corticosteroids, also called glucocorticoids or steroids, are powerful 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids are not bronchodilators (they do not relax 
the airways) and have little immediate effect on symptoms. Instead, they work 
over time to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent injury in the lungs. 
They can also help prevent asthma attacks from occurring. The use of inhaled 
corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma reduces the risk of 
rehospitalization and death from asthma.</p> 
<p>Taking a corticosteroid drug through an inhaler makes it possible to 
provide effective local anti inflammatory activity in the lungs with very few 
side effects elsewhere in the body. (By contrast, oral steroids have 
considerable side effects throughout the body.) Inhaled corticosteroids are 
recommended as the primary therapy for any patient needing long-term control 
medications for persistent asthma.</p> 
<p>Examples of inhaled corticosteroids: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inhaled steroids include fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), 
triamcinolone (Azmacort and others), mometasone furoate (Asmanex), flunisolide 
(AeroBid), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).</li> 
<li>The older corticosteroid inhalants are beclomethasone (Beclovent, 
Vanceril) and dexamethasone (Decadron Phosphate Respihaler and others).</li> 
<li>Budesonide (Pulmicort Respules) is available in a jet nebulizer for 
children ages 12 months - 8 years. It was the first such medication to be 
approved for children in this age group.</li> 
<li>Inhalers that combine both long-acting beta2-agonists and corticosteroids 
are also available. These include Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) and 
fluticosone-salmeterol (Advair).</li> </ul> 
<p>Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred first-line therapy for children 
with asthma. However, doctors caution against corticosteroids for infants and 
toddlers with mild asthma and urge close monitoring, especially for children 
under age 5 with severe asthma who are receiving high doses.</p> 
<p>Inhaled corticosteroids and growth in children is a common concern. 
However, a number of studies report only a slight effect (about half an inch) 
on children's growth, which may be only temporary. These growth changes are 
mostly when higher doses are being used. Poorly controlled asthma can also 
affect growth.</p> 
<p>Side effects of inhaled steroids may include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>The most common side effects are throat irritation, hoarseness, and dry 
mouth. Using a spacer device and rinsing the mouth after each treatment can 
minimize or prevent these effects.</li> 
<li>Rashes, wheezing, facial swelling (edema), fungal infections (thrush) in 
the mouth and throat, and bruising are also possible, but not common, with 
inhalators.</li> 
<li>Some studies have suggested a higher risk for gum inflammation. </li> 
<li>It is not yet known whether inhaled steroids affect lung development in 
very young children. Steroids administered using nebulizers are of particular 
concern.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h4> 
<p>Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are used for preventing an asthma attack 
(not for treating attack symptoms). These drugs should never be used alone in 
the treatment of asthma in adults or children. They can be dangerous when used 
alone, because they can mask asthma symptoms, and they can increase the risk of 
asthma death unless paired with an inhaled steroid. LABAs should only be used 
in combination with an asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled 
corticosteroid. LABAs should be used for the shortest time possible, and should 
only be used by patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by asthma 
controller medications.</p> 
<p>Salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol-budesonide (Symbicort) are 
long-acting beta2 agonists products combined with a steroid in a single inhaler 
that are used for treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma. Advair is approved 
for children ages 4 years and older, and Symbicort is approved for children 
ages 12 years and older.</p> 
<h4>Cromolyn</h4> 
<p>Cromolyn sodium (Intal) is both an anti-inflammatory drug and has 
antihistamine properties that block asthma triggers, such as allergens, cold, 
or exercise. A cromolyn nasal spray called NasalCrom has been approved for 
over-the-counter purchase, but only to relieve nasal congestion caused by 
allergies. Patients should not use it for self-medication without the advice of 
a doctor.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> Side effects of cromolyn include nasal congestion, 
coughing, sneezing, wheezing, nausea, nosebleeds, and dry throat.</p> 
<h4>Leukotriene Antagonists</h4> 
<p>Leukotriene antagonists (also called anti-leukotrienes or leukotriene 
modifiers) are oral medications used for prevention, NOT for treating acute 
asthma attacks.</p> 
<p>Leukotriene antagonists include zafirlukast (Accolate) and montelukast 
(Singulair). These drugs are considered an alternative for long-term control of 
asthma, but inhaled corticosteroids should always be used first. Other 
potential uses include preventing exercise-induced asthma.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects and Complications.</i> Gastrointestinal distress (stomach 
upset or pain) is the most common side effect of leukotriene antagonists. 
Zafirlukast may cause liver injury when taken at higher than standard doses. No 
adverse effects on the liver have been reported to date with montelukast.</p> 
<p>Mental health difficulties and behavioral changes have been associated with 
these medications. These mood problems include agitation, aggression, 
anxiousness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, depression, insomnia, 
irritability, restlessness, tremor, and suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Patients who take a leukotriene antagonist drug should be monitored for signs 
of behavioral and mood changes. Doctors should consider discontinuing the drug 
if patients exhibit any of these symptoms.</p> 
<h4>Omalizumab</h4> 
<p>Omalizumab (Xolair) is FDA-approved for patients age 12 and older. It 
should be considered only for children over 12 years who have 
moderate-to-severe persistent asthma related to allergies and for adults who 
have severe asthma and allergies. Omalizumab is a biologic drug that targets 
and blocks the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE), a a chemical trigger of the 
inflammatory events associated with an allergic asthma attack.</p> 
<p>Omalizumab is given by injection every 2 - 4 weeks. It is used only to 
treat patients whose symptoms are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids.</p>
<p><em>Side Effects and Complications</em>. About 1 in 1,000 patients who take 
omalizumab develop anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction). Patients 
can develop anaphylaxis after any dose of omalizumab, even if they had no 
reaction to a first dose. Anaphylaxis may occur up to 24 hours after the dose 
is given.</p> 
<p>Omalizumab should always be injected in a doctor&rsquo;s office and health 
care providers should observe patients for at least 2 hours after an injection. 
Patients should also carry emergency self-treatment for anaphylaxis (such as an 
Epi-Pen) and know how to use it. With an Epi-Pen, or similar auto-injector 
device, patients can quickly give themselves a life-saving dose of epinephrine.
</p> 
<p>Anaphylaxis symptoms include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Difficulty breathing </li> 
<li>Chest tightness </li> 
<li>Dizziness </li> 
<li>Fainting </li> 
<li>Itching and hives </li> 
<li>Swelling of the mouth and throat</li> </ul> 
<p>[For more information, see <em>In-Depth Report</em> #4: Asthma in adults.] 
</p> 
<p>The FDA is currently reviewing whether omalizumab may be associated with 
increased risk for heart and vascular problems (ischemic heart disease, 
arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and blood 
clots).</p> 
<h4>Theophylline</h4> 
<p>Theophylline relaxes the muscles around the bronchioles and also stimulates 
breathing. Since the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting 
beta2-agonists, theophylline is not used as often for asthma treatment. It may 
still be used in some circumstances, such as for treating nocturnal asthma. 
Theophylline is available in tablet, liquid, and injectable forms. Theophylline 
should not be used by people with peptic ulcers, and should be used with 
caution by anyone with heart disease, liver disease, high blood pressure, or 
seizure disorders.</p> 
<p>If a child is taking theophylline on an ongoing basis, the doctor should 
monitor the drug level at the start of therapy and at regular intervals 
thereafter.</p> 
<h3>Other Treatments</h3> 
<h4>Immunizations</h4> 
<p>Children older than 6 months should receive an influenza vaccination every 
year. Children between 2 months and 2 years of age should receive a series of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, but children older than 2 years should receive 
one dose of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.</p> 
<h4>Treating Allergies and Sinusitis</h4> 
<p>Treatment of allergies and sinusitis can help control asthma. [For more 
information, see<em>In-Depth Reports</em> #77: Allergic Rhinitis and #62: 
Sinusitis.] </p> 
<p>Patients with asthma and chronic allergic rhinitis may need daily 
medications. Patients with severe seasonal allergies may need to start taking 
medications a few weeks before the pollen season, and to continue them until 
the season is over.</p> 
<p>Immunotherapy (&quot;allergy shots&quot;) may help reduce asthma symptoms, 
and the use of asthma medications, in patients with known allergies. They may 
also help prevent the development of asthma in children with allergies. 
Immunotherapy poses some risk for severe allergic reactions, especially for 
children with poorly controlled asthma, so it is important that the doctor 
carefully evaluates the child&rsquo;s asthma condition.</p> 
<h4>Treating Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</h4> 
<p>Children with obvious symptoms of reflux (heartburn) or children who have 
difficulty managing asthma may consider the following lifestyle changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoiding heavy meals and meals with fried food </li> 
<li>Avoiding caffeine products (cola drinks and chocolate), garlic, and onions 
</li> 
<li>Avoiding eating or drinking at least 3 hours before bedtime </li> 
<li>Elevating the head of the bed by 6 inches </li> 
<li>Medications are available for treating gastroesophageal reflux but should 
be discussed with your doctor</li> </ul> 
<h4>Other Treatments</h4> 
<p>Alternative therapies are widely used by children, adolescents, and adults 
with asthma. In one study, nearly half of asthma or allergy sufferers resorted 
to alternative treatments. To date, however, evidence does not support most 
alternative therapies, including high-dose vitamins, urine injections, 
homeopathic remedies, and most herbal remedies.</p> 
<p><i>Relaxation and Stress-Reduction Techniques.</i> Patients report benefits 
from many stress reduction and physical techniques, such as acupuncture, 
hypnosis, breathing relaxation techniques, the Alexander technique, massage 
therapy, and meditation. There have been very few well-conducted studies 
supporting their use, however.</p>  Acupuncture, hypnosis, and biofeedback are 
alternative ways to control pain. Acupuncture involves the insertion of tiny 
sterile needles, slightly thicker than a human hair, at specific points on the 
body.<br>

<p><i>Breathing Exercises.</i> Breathing exercises may help improve 
patients&rsquo; quality of life even if they do not have a major impact on 
medication reduction.</p> 
<p><i>Probiotics.</i> Probiotics are beneficial microbes that some believe may 
help protect against allergies and asthma. Probiotics can be obtained in active 
yogurt cultures and in supplements, which are being studied for protection. 
However, evidence to date does not support efficacy in preventing or treating 
asthma.</p> 
<p><i>Herbal Remedies.</i> Few rigorous studies have evaluated herbal remedies 
for asthma. Manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not 
need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and 
supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential 
to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a number of 
reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. 
Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary 
supplements.</p> 
<h3>Managing Asthma At Home</h3> 
<p>The more allergies a child has, the more severe the asthma. Making 
lifestyle changes to reduce allergy attacks and other triggers is extremely 
important.</p> 
<h4>Asthma Action Plans</h4> 
<p>Asthma action plans create a written document for patients and parents to 
manage asthma during stable times and to more easily identify when asthma is 
worsening. Important components of a home program include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A clearly written plan for taking asthma medications when condition is 
stable</li> 
<li>A complete education regarding the difference between long-term control 
medications and quick-relief medications</li> 
<li>Monitoring of asthma on a daily basis. Symptom monitoring is adequate for 
patients with intermittent or mild persistent asthma. Peak flow monitoring 
should be performed in patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma or 
those with a history of more severe exacerbations (sudden worsening or increase 
in severity of symptoms).</li> 
<li>A list of environmental control measures that need to be taken </li> 
<li>When to seek medical care</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Managing Asthma Exacerbations</em>. Always refer to the written action 
plan from your doctors and nurses. Treatment approaches generally include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Recognizing symptoms and measuring peak flow </li> 
<li>Using for the first time or increasing usage of short-acting medications 
</li> 
<li>Eliminating or withdrawing from any triggers or irritants that may be 
responsible for increase in severity of symptoms</li> 
<li>Depending on written instructions from doctor, beginning oral 
corticosteroids if required</li> 
<li>Monitoring response to treatments and communicating with doctor if 
symptoms worsen or if severe symptoms occur. [See<em>Symptoms</em> section.]
</li> </ul> 
<p>Follow-up generally depends on the severity of asthma, how recently asthma 
was diagnosed, patient compliance, and whether recent changes in treatment were 
made.</p> 
<h4>Avoiding Environmental Triggers</h4> 
<p>House dust is a reservoir for pollen and dust mites. It is important to 
control household allergens and pollutants in the home.</p> 
<p><em>Controlling for Dust.</em> Spray furniture polish is very effective for 
reducing both dust and allergens. Air cleaners, filters for air conditioners, 
and vacuum cleaners with High Efficiency Particular Air (HEPA) filters can help 
remove particles and small allergens found indoors. Neither vacuuming nor the 
use of anti-mite carpet shampoo, however, is effective in removing mites in 
house dust. In fact, vacuuming stirs up both mites and cat allergens. If 
possible, avoid carpets and rugs.</p> <br>
<br>
 Click the icon to see an image 
of a HEPA air filter. 
<p><em>Controlling Pets.</em> For children who have an existing allergy to 
pets:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If possible, keep pets outside. </li> 
<li>If this isn't possible, confine pets to carpet-free areas outside the 
bedroom. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on 
clothing. Dogs usually cause fewer problems.</li> 
<li>Wash animals once a week to reduce allergens. Dry shampoos, available for 
both cats and dogs, can remove allergens from the skin and fur and are easier 
to administer than wet shampoos.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Bedding, Curtains, and Bedroom Environment.</em> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Replace curtains with shades or blinds, and wash bedding using the highest 
temperature setting.</li> 
<li>Encase mattress and pillow in special dust mite proof covers (synthetic 
pillows may pose a higher risk for asthma attacks than feather pillows, or no 
pillow at all).</li> 
<li>Wash pillows in water hotter than 150 &deg;F, or in cooler water with 
detergent and bleach.</li> 
<li>Wash sheets and blankets weekly in hot water. </li> 
<li>Avoid sleeping or lying on cushions or furniture that are cloth covered. 
</li> 
<li>Keep stuffed toys away from the bed and wash them weekly in hot water. 
Placing toys in a dryer or freezer may help, but is not as helpful as washing.
</li> 
<li>Avoid the bottom bunk of the bunk bed. In general, children should sleep 
as high off the floor as possible.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

an image of dust mite prevention. 
<p><i>Exterminating Pests (Cockroaches and Mice).</i> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use professional exterminators to eliminate cockroaches. Cleaning the 
house using standard housecleaning techniques may not eliminate the cockroach 
allergens themselves.)</li> 
<li>Exterminate mice, and attempt to remove all dust, which might contain 
mouse urine and dander.</li> 
<li>Keep food and garbage in closed containers. </li> 
<li>Keep food out of bedrooms.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Reducing Humidity in the House.</i> Living in a damp environment is 
counterproductive. Humidity levels should not exceed 30 - 50%.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fix all leaky faucets and pipes, and eliminate collections of water around 
the outside of the house.</li> 
<li>Dehumidify basements, but empty humidifiers and clean them daily with 
vinegar solution.</li> 
<li>Clean often any moldy surfaces in the basement or in other areas of the 
home.</li> 
<li>Avoid prolonged used of vaporizers to manage symptoms during asthma 
attacks.</li> </ul>  Many of the same substances trigger both allergies and 
asthma. Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, mold, and pet dander. 
Other asthma triggers include irritants like smoke, pollution, fumes, cleaning 
chemicals, and sprays. Avoiding exposure to known allergens and respiratory 
irritants can substantially reduce asthma symptoms.<br>

<p><i>Preventing Exposure to Cigarette and Cooking Smoke.</i> Parents who 
smoke are strongly urged to quit. Studies indicate that exposure to second-hand 
smoke in the home increases the risk for asthma and asthma-related emergency 
room visits in children. Even smoky cooking can worsen asthma.</p> 
<p><i>Avoiding Outdoor Allergens.</i> The following are some recommendations 
for avoiding allergens outside:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid scheduling camping and hiking trips during times of high pollen 
count (generally, May and June for grass pollen and mid-August to October for 
ragweed).</li> 
<li>Avoid strenuous activity when ozone levels are highest, which usually 
occur in early afternoon, particularly on hot hazy summer days. Levels are 
lowest in early morning and at dusk.</li> 
<li>Asthma attacks are often triggered by thunderstorms. It is not clear why. 
Some evidence points to a build-up of ozone that accompanies such storms.</li> 
<li>Patients who are allergic to mold should avoid barns, hay, raking leaves, 
and mowing grass. Exposure to automobile fumes may worsen asthma. Fungi in car 
air conditioners can also be a problem.</li> 
<li>Air pollution can worsen existing asthma. Avoid strenuous activity during 
times of high air pollution.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Managing Asthma at School</h4> 
<p>Parents should make sure that their child&rsquo;s school has a copy of the 
written asthma action plan. The plan should contain a list of medications the 
child takes (including which ones need to be taken during school hours), 
identified asthma triggers, and emergency contact numbers. Parents should also 
make sure that the school staff is trained in the steps to take in case of an 
asthma attack.</p> 
<h4>Exercise</h4> 
<p>Asthma is no reason to avoid exercise. Historically, about 10% of Olympic 
athletes have asthma. Some studies indicate that long-term exercise may help 
control asthma and reduce hospitalization. Exercise can help control weight, 
which can help with asthma symptoms.</p> 
<p>Encourage children with asthma to swim and play sports, such as baseball, 
that will be less difficult for them. Intense activities lasting less than 2 
minutes, such as sprinting or competitive swimming, may cause fewer problems 
than longer-lasting exercises.</p> 
<p>Young people who enjoy running should probably choose an indoor track to 
avoid pollutants. Swimming is excellent for people with asthma. Yoga, which 
uses stretching, breathing, and meditation techniques, may have particular 
benefits.</p> 
<p>Patients should consult their doctors before starting any exercise program. 
Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited condition that has specific 
recommendations.</p> 
<p><em>Hints for Reducing Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA).</em> EIA occurs <i>
only</i> after exercise and is more likely to occur with regular paced 
activities in cold, dry air. The following are some suggestions for reducing 
its impact:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Comply with long-term control medications, particularly inhaled 
corticosteroids, when prescribed.</li> 
<li>Warm-up and cool-down before and after exercise. </li> 
<li>Participate in activities with short bursts of exercise (such as tennis 
and football) rather than exercises involving long-duration pacing (such as 
cycling, soccer, and distance running).</li> 
<li>Breathe through a scarf or through the nose. This helps warm up the 
airways when exercising in cold air.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Medications.</em> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Short-acting beta2-agonists taken before exercise are generally considered 
the first choice, and they last for 2 - 3 hours</li> 
<li>Cromolyn is another option but it is not as effective </li> 
<li>Leukotriene antagonists are another option, but they generally take hours 
to be effective</li> </ul> 
<h4>Preventing and Treating Respiratory Infections</h4> 
<p>People with asthma should try to minimize their risk for respiratory tract 
infections. Washing hands is a very simple but effective preventive measure.</p>
