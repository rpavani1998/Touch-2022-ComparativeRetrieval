<h2>Asthma in adults</h2> 
<h3>Highlights</h3> 
<p><strong>Asthma Guidelines</strong> </p> 
<p>The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 
guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma recommend:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Assessment and Monitoring</em>. Doctors should use multiple measures 
to determine a patient&rsquo;s current condition and future risk for worsening 
of condition. Even patients who show few daily effects of asthma may be in 
danger of sudden worsening of symptoms.</li> 
<li><em>Patient Education</em>. Patients should be taught skills to 
self-monitor and manage asthma. Doctors should give patients a written asthma 
action plan, which includes information on daily treatment and ways to 
recognize worsening asthma.</li> 
<li><em>Control of Environmental Factors and Other Asthma Triggers</em>. The 
guidelines outline new approaches for reducing exposure to allergens. They also 
address how treating co-existing chronic conditions (such as rhinitis, 
sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity) can help improve asthma 
control.</li> 
<li><em>Medications</em>. A stepwise approach is recommended where medication 
types and doses are increased or decreased based on the level of asthma control.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Asthma Symptoms</strong> </p> 
<p>Symptoms of asthma include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wheezing </li> 
<li>Shortness of breath </li> 
<li>Coughing </li> 
<li>Chest tightness </li> </ul> 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
<p>The word <i>asthma</i> originates from an ancient Greek word meaning 
panting. Essentially, asthma is an inflammatory lung condition that makes it 
difficult to breathe properly.</p> 
<p>When people inhale, the air travels through the following structures: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Air passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways 
called<em>bronchi</em> and then <i>bronchioles</i>. The lungs contain millions 
of these airways.</li> 
<li>All bronchioles lead to <i>alveoli</i>, which are microscopic sacs where 
oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled.</li> </ul>  The major 
features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveoli. 
The alveoli are the microscopic sacs lined by tiny blood vessels that take in 
oxygen and give up carbon dioxide.<br>

<p>Asthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when 
stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to 
be two specific responses:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The <i>hyperreactive</i> response (also called hyperresponsiveness) </li> 
<li>The <i>inflammatory</i> response</li> </ul> 
<p>These actions in the airway cause coughing, wheezing, and shortness of 
breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.</p> 
<h4>Hyperreactive Response</h4> 
<p>In the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways of the lungs 
constrict and narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other 
irritants. Airways in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to 
allergens or irritants but there are major differences in the hyperreactive 
response that occurs in people with asthma:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When people <i>without</i> asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways 
relax and open to rid the lungs of the irritant.</li> 
<li>When people <i>with</i> asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their 
airways do not relax and narrow, causing patients to pant for breath. Smooth 
muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, perhaps a 
deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from relaxing. And, 
during an asthma attack the airways narrow, making breathing difficult.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Inflammatory Response</h4> 
<p>The hyperreactive stage is followed by the <i>inflammatory</i> response, 
which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In response to allergens or other environmental triggers, the immune 
system delivers white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.</li> 
<li>These so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, to fill 
with fluid, and to produce a thick sticky mucus.</li> 
<li>This combination results in wheezing, breathlessness, an inability to 
exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>Inflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with 
asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the 
disease.</p> 
<h3>Causes</h3> 
<p>The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Asthma is most likely caused by a 
combination of genetic (inherited) factors and environmental triggers (such as 
allergens and infections). Asthma tends to run in families, so children whose 
parents have asthma are more likely to develop it themselves.</p> 
<h4>The Allergic Response (Allergens)</h4> 
<p>Nearly half of adults with asthma have an allergy-related condition, which, 
in most cases developed first in childhood. (In patients who first develop 
asthma during adulthood, the allergic response usually does not play a strong 
causal role.)</p> 
<p>In people with allergies, the immune system overreacts to exposure to 
allergens. Allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling certain substances 
(allergens) such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that 
contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.</li> 
<li>Animal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be 
carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who 
already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for 
developing such allergies later on.</li> 
<li>Molds. </li> 
<li>Cockroaches. Cockroach dust is a major asthma trigger and may reduce lung 
function even in people without a history of asthma.</li> 
<li>Pollen, from plants.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Environmental Factors (Irritants)</h4> 
<p>An asthma attack can also be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to 
the lungs. Important irritants involved in asthma include cigarette smoke, 
indoor chemicals, and air pollution.</p> 
<h4>Infections</h4> 
<p>Respiratory viral and bacterial infections play a role in some cases of 
adult-onset asthma. In both children and adults with existing allergic asthma, 
an upper respiratory tract infection often worsens an attack.</p> 
<h3>Risk Factors</h3> 
<p>About 22 million Americans have asthma. </p> 
<h4>Gender</h4> 
<p>Before puberty, asthma occurs more often in males, but after adolescence, 
it is more common in females. In adults, women are more likely to report severe 
symptoms than men.</p> 
<p>Hormonal fluctuations or changes in hormone levels may play a role in the 
severity of asthma in women. Between 30 - 40% of women with asthma experience 
fluctuations in severity that are associated with their menstrual cycle. Some 
women first develop asthma during or shortly after pregnancy, while others 
first develop it around the time of menopause (perimenopause).</p> 
<h4>Race and Ethnicity</h4> 
<p>African-Americans have higher rates of asthma than Caucasians or other 
ethnic groups. They are also more likely to die of the disease. Ethnicity and 
genetics, however, are less likely to play a role in these differences than 
socioeconomic differences, such as having less access to optimal health care, 
and greater likelihood of living in an urban area (another asthma risk factor).
</p> 
<h4>Obesity</h4> 
<p>Studies report a strong association between obesity and asthma. Evidence 
also suggests that people who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) 
have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone 
who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath helps reduce airway 
obstruction and improve lung function. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth 
Report</em> #53: Weight control and diet.] </p> 
<h4>Other Risk Factors</h4> 
<p><em>GERD</em>. At least half of patients with asthma have gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which 
condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors. 
Treating GERD does not appear to improve asthma control. [For more information, 
see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease.]
</p> 
<p><em>Aspirin-Induced Asthma</em>. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a 
condition in which asthma gets worse after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AIA often develops after a viral infection. 
It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition, associated with many 
asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible 
for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal 
congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the 
nasal passages. Patients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin 
and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil and other brands, generic) and 
naproxen (Aleve, generic).</p> 
<h3>Prognosis</h3> 
<p>Asthma is usually chronic, although it occasionally goes into long periods 
of remission. Long-term outlook generally depends on severity:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In mild-to-moderate cases, asthma can improve over time, and many adults 
even become symptom free.</li> 
<li>Even in some severe cases, adults may experience improvement depending on 
the degree of obstruction in the lungs and the timeliness and effectiveness of 
treatment.</li> 
<li>In about 10% of severe persistent cases, changes in the structure of the 
walls of the airways lead to progressive and irreversible problems in lung 
function, even in aggressively treated patients.</li> </ul> 
<p>Lung function declines faster than average in people with asthma, 
particularly in those who smoke and in those with excessive mucus production 
(an indicator of poor treatment control).</p> 
<p>Death from asthma is a relatively uncommon event, and most asthma deaths 
are preventable. It is very rare for a person who is receiving proper treatment 
to die of asthma. However, even when it is not life threatening, asthma can be 
debilitating and frightening. Asthma that is not properly controlled can 
interfere with school and work, as well as with daily activities.</p> 
<h3>Symptoms</h3> 
<p>Asthma symptoms vary in severity from occasional mild bouts of 
breathlessness to daily wheezing that lasts even when a patient takes large 
doses of medication. After exposure to asthma triggers, symptoms rarely develop 
abruptly but progress over a period of hours or days. Occasionally, the airways 
have become seriously obstructed by the time the patient calls the doctor.</p> 
<p>The classic symptoms of an asthma attack include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wheezing when breathing out is nearly always present during an attack. 
Wheezing is a whistling sound caused by narrowed airways.</li> 
<li>Shortness of breath (<i>dyspnea</i>). Shortness of breath is a major 
source of distress in patients with asthma. Breathing may be shallower and more 
rapid. Use of the muscles at the base of the neck and between the ribs may be 
more exaggerated than normal.</li> 
<li>However, some patients may not feel as short of breath or uncomfortable as 
would be expected from measurements of their lung function or oxygen levels. 
These patients are at particular risk for very serious and even 
life-threatening asthma attacks, as they may be less likely to seek care when 
their oxygen levels are dangerously low</li> 
<li>Coughing. In some people, the first (or only) symptom of asthma is a dry 
cough. Some patients find this cough even more distressing than wheezing or 
sleep disturbances.</li> 
<li>Chest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other 
symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.</li> 
<li>Rapid heart rate </li> 
<li>Sweating</li> </ul> 
<p>The end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, 
stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation lasts for days to 
weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, 
however, because it usually causes relapse.)</p> 
<h4>Symptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack</h4> 
<p>The following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>As the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often 
becomes shallow.</li> 
<li>Lacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish. </li> 
<li>The flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in. </li> 
<li>The patient may begin to lose consciousness.</li> </ul> 
<p>Asthma often progresses very slowly, but it may sometimes develop to a 
fatal or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to 
predict when an attack will become very serious.</p> 
<h4>Exercise-Induced Asthma</h4> 
<p>Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise 
triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally 
occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold 
dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising 
and then gradually resolve.</p> 
<p>EIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic 
asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as 
allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People 
who have only EIA do not need long-term maintenance therapy.</p> 
<h4>Nocturnal Asthma</h4> 
<p>Asthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of 
patients with asthma. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 a.m. Nighttime 
attacks may indicate poor asthma control.</p> 
<h3>Diagnosis</h3> 
<p>When asthma is suspected, the patient should describe for the doctor any 
pattern related to the symptoms, and possible precipitating factors, including:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Whether symptoms are more frequent during the spring or fall (allergy 
seasons).</li> 
<li>Whether exercise, a respiratory infection, or exposure to cold air has 
ever triggered an attack.</li> 
<li>Any family history of asthma or allergic disorders, such as eczema, hives, 
or hay fever.</li> 
<li>Any occupational or long-term exposure to chemicals. If symptoms improve 
on weekends and vacation and are worse at work, the job may be the likely 
source of the asthma.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Ruling out Other Diseases</h4> 
<p>A number of disorders may cause some or all of the symptoms of asthma: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma and chronic obstructive lung diseases (chronic bronchitis and 
emphysema) affect the lungs in similar ways and, in fact, may all be present in 
the same person. Unlike other chronic lung conditions, asthma usually first 
appears in patients younger than age 30 and with chest x-rays that are normal. 
Still, it may be difficult to distinguish among these disorders in some adults 
with late onset asthma.</li> 
<li>Panic disorder can coincide with asthma or be confused with it. </li> 
<li>Other diseases that must be considered during diagnosis are pneumonia, 
bronchitis, severe allergic reactions, pulmonary embolism, cancer, heart 
failure, tumors, psychosomatic illnesses, and certain rare disorders.</li> </ul>
<h4>Pulmonary Function Tests</h4> 
<p>If symptoms and a patient's history suggest asthma, the doctor will usually 
perform<i>pulmonary function tests</i> to confirm the diagnosis and determine 
the severity of the disease.</p> 
<p>Using a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and 
exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Vital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or 
exhaled.</li> 
<li>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the 
maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.</li> 
<li>Forced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in one 
second.</li> </ul>  Spirometry is a painless study of air volume and flow rate 
within the lungs. Spirometry is frequently used to evaluate lung function in 
people with obstructive or restrictive lung diseases such as asthma or cystic 
fibrosis.<br>

<p>If the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on 
the results, the doctor will take the following steps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a 
bronchodilator medication. This drug is used in asthma to open the air 
passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more 
normal, the drug likely has cleared the airways and a diagnosis of asthma is 
likely.</li> 
<li>If measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is 
still suspected, the doctor may perform a<em>challenge test</em><em>.</em> This 
involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually 
increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Allergy Tests</h4> 
<p>The patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a 
specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests 
may help diagnose allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people 
with year-round asthma.</p> <br>

<h3>Treatment</h3> 
<h4>General Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma</h4> 
<p>While medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, 
appropriate management of asthma involves much more:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Identifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers </li> 
<li>Following appropriate drug treatments </li> 
<li>Home monitoring performed by either patient or family </li> 
<li>Good communication between the doctor and patient </li> 
<li>Needed psychosocial support </li> 
<li>Treatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)</li> </ul>
<p>The severity of asthma is classified into four groups: Intermittent, Mild 
Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components 
of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Symptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout 
the day</li> 
<li>Nighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly </li> 
<li>Short-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or 
fewer days per week to several times per day</li> 
<li>Interference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited 
</li> 
<li>Lung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary 
function testing at the doctor's office</li> 
<li>Number of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, 
ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months</li> </ul> 
<h4>Treating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease</h4> 
<p>Patients can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks by 
understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling 
the disease over time.</p> 
<p>Medications for asthma fall into two categories: </p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Rescue (Quick-Relief) Medication.</i> Medications that open the airways 
(bronchodilators, or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or 
severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic 
agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include 
corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and 
anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are 
only useful for treating symptoms.</li> 
<li><i>Long-Term Control (Maintenance) Medication.</i> It is very important to 
control the damaging inflammatory response associated with asthma and not 
simply treat symptoms. For adults and children over age 5 with 
moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, doctors recommend inhaled 
corticosteroids, which are sometimes used along with long-acting beta2-agonists 
when corticosteroids alone fail to control the disease.</li> </ul> 
<p>Patients can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks by 
understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling 
the disease over time. Unfortunately, many patients do not understand the 
difference between medications that provide rapid short-term relief and those 
that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or 
severe asthma overuse their short-term bronchodilator medications and underuse 
their long-term corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can 
have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.
</p> 
<p>These are the signs of well-controlled asthma: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma symptoms occur twice a week or less </li> 
<li>Rescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less </li> 
<li>Symptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening </li> 
<li>Symptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities </li> 
<li>Peak flow meter readings are normal or the patient&rsquo;s personal best 
</li> 
<li>Both the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled
</li> </ul> 
<h4>Steps for Treating Asthma</h4> 
<p>A stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and 
dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on a 
patient&rsquo;s age and asthma severity, there are specific recommendations 
regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. 
Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other 
conditions are also needed. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations 
based on a specific patient.</p> 
<p>In choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual 
patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this 
include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to 
different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks 
of starting therapy to assess response.</p> 
<p>Key points regarding recommendations for adults include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. 
Long-acting beta2-agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies 
usually used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.</li> 
<li>Avoiding or managing environmental triggers is always important.</li> </ul>
<h4>Devices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs</h4> 
<p>Most asthma drugs are taken with inhalers. In a hospital setting, or when a 
patient cannot use an inhaler, a nebulizer may be used. A nebulizer is a device 
that administers the drug in a fine spray that the patient breathes in. The two 
basic inhaler devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and dry powder 
inhalers (DPIs).</p> 
<p><i>Metered-Dose Inhaler.</i> The standard device for administering any 
asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly 
when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the 
lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a 
holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) 
MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient 
carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some 
patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others 
may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.</p> 
<p>The spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient 
additional time to inhale. In addition, MDIs can continue to deliver propellant 
even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and 
throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.</p> <br>

<p><i>Dry Powder Inhalers.</i> Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered 
form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Some 
patients find that they are easier to manage than MDIs. Humidity or extreme 
temperatures can affect the performance of these inhalers, so they should not 
be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high 
temperatures (glove compartments during summer months.</p> 
<p>Dry-powder may cause tooth erosion, and children are advised to rinse their 
mouths out right after using a DPI and to brush twice a day with a fluoride 
toothpaste.</p> 
<h4>Monitoring</h4> 
<p>People who self-manage their asthma with peak air flow measurements and 
adjust their medications as needed have fewer hospitalizations and unplanned 
doctors' visits, and, generally, have a better quality of life than those who 
rely only on the occasional doctor or emergency room visit to control symptoms. 
Doctors recommend that patients with even mild asthma monitor their own 
conditions.</p> 
<p>In general, monitoring involves the following steps: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>A peak flow meter is the standard monitoring device for measuring peak 
expiratory flow rate (PEFR).</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
 Click the icon to see an 
image of a peak flow meter. 
<ul> 
<li>Patients with severe asthma should take PEFR readings two or three times a 
day. The overall goal should be to achieve less than a 20% (and ideally only 
10%) variation in readings between evening and morning rates. For 
mild-to-moderate asthma, a single determination each morning usually suffices, 
but patients should check with their doctors.</li> 
<li>It is important to use the meter at the same times each day and to stand 
or sit in the same position to keep an accurate record.</li> 
<li>Patients should keep an ongoing record of their peak flow readings to help 
them detect worsening of their condition.</li> 
<li>They should also record attacks, exposure to any allergens or triggers, 
and medications taken.</li> 
<li>After about 2 months, patients and doctors can use the recorded data for 
administering medications effectively and to recognize problems before they 
become serious.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Treatment of Asthma during Pregnancy</h4> 
<p>Guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 
(NAEPP) emphasize that most asthma medications are safe for pregnant women. The 
guidelines recommend that pregnant women with asthma have albuterol available 
at all times. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used for persistent asthma. 
Patients whose persistent asthma does not respond to standard dosages of 
inhaled corticosteroids may need a higher dosage or the addition of a 
long-acting beta-agonist to their drug regimen. For severe asthma, oral 
corticosteroids may be necessary. The NAEPP notes that while it is not clear if 
oral corticosteroids are safe for pregnant women, uncontrolled asthma poses an 
even greater risk for a woman and her fetus.</p> 
<h4>Treatment of Severe Persistent Asthma</h4> 
<p>Bronchial thermoplasty is an outpatient procedure that was FDA-approved in 
2010 but is reserved for select adult patients whose severe and persistent 
asthma has not been helped by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta 
agonist medications. The procedure uses radiofrequency energy to heat lung 
tissue and reduce the thickness of smooth muscle in the airways so that 
patients can breathe better. While bronchial thermoplasty may help reduce the 
number of severe asthma attacks over the long term, the procedure carries a 
number of risks including the possibility of asthma attacks during the course 
of treatment. More experience is needed to evaluate long-term risks and 
benefits of this invasive treatment. Preliminary reports suggest that the 
benefits are long lasting with minimal delayed adverse effects.</p>

<h3>Quick-Relief Medications</h3> 
<p>These medications quickly control acute asthma attacks. </p> 
<h4>Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h4> 
<p>Beta2-agonists do not reduce inflammation or airway responsiveness but 
serve as<i>bronchodilators</i>, relaxing and opening constricted airways during 
an acute asthma attack. They are used alone only for patients with mild and 
intermittent asthma. Patients with more severe cases should use them in 
combination with other drugs.</p>  Asthma is a disease in which inflammation of 
the airways causes airflow into and out of the lungs to be restricted. When an 
asthma attack occurs, mucus production is increased, muscles of the bronchial 
tree become tight, and the lining of the air passages swells, reducing airflow 
and producing the characteristic wheezing sound.<br>

<p>Specific short-acting beta2-agonists include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the U.S., is 
the standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar 
beta2-agonists are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, and Medihaler-Iso), 
metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, 
Brethaire, and Bricanyl), and bitolterol (Tornalate).</li> 
<li>Newer beta2-agonists, including levalbuterol (Xopenex), have more specific 
actions than the standard drugs. Studies have indicated that levalbuterol is as 
effective as albuterol with fewer side effects.</li> </ul> 
<p>Short-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation 
and are effective for 3 - 6 hours. They relieve the symptoms of acute attacks, 
but they do not control the underlying inflammation. If asthma continues to 
worsen with the use of these drugs, patients should discuss corticosteroids or 
other drugs to treat underlying inflammation.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects of Beta2-Agonists.</i> Side effects of all beta2-agonists 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anxiety </li> 
<li>Tremor </li> 
<li>Restlessness </li> 
<li>Headache </li> 
<li>Fast and irregular heartbeats. Notify a doctor immediately if this side 
effect occurs, particularly in people with existing heart conditions. Such 
patients face an increased risk for sudden death from cardiac related causes.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Beta2-agonists have serious interactions with certain other drugs, such as 
beta-blockers, and patients should tell the doctor about any other medications 
they are taking. People with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, 
hyperthyroidism, an enlarged prostate, or a history of seizures should use 
these drugs with caution.</p> 
<p><i>Loss of Effectiveness and Overdose.</i> Short-acting beta2-agonists 
become less effective when taken regularly over time, which increases the risk 
for overuse. Overdose can be serious and in rare cases even life threatening, 
particularly in patients with heart disease.</p> 
<h4>Anticholinergic Drugs</h4> 
<p>Two inhaled drugs, ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and tiotropium (Spiriva) 
act as bronchodilators over time. Neither is highly beneficial for acute asthma 
attacks. Moreover, the drugs are not approved specifically for asthma. They 
may, however, have some benefits:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>They may be useful for certain older patients with asthma who also have 
emphysema or chronic bronchitis.</li> 
<li>Combining them with a beta2-agonist might help patients who do not 
initially respond to treatment with a beta2-agonist alone.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Oral (Systemic) Corticosteroids</h4> 
<p>Common oral corticosteroids include prednisone, prednisolone, 
methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone. They very effectively reduce 
inflammation. They are generally used for asthma flareups that do not respond 
to inhaler medications. In some severe cases, they may be used as maintenance 
therapy. Usually, the dosage starts out higher and is then gradually reduced 
over a 5 - 7 day period.</p> 
<p>Adverse effects of prolonged use of oral steroids include cataracts, 
glaucoma, osteoporosis, diabetes, fluid retention, susceptibility to 
infections, weight gain, hypertension, capillary fragility, acne, excess hair 
growth, wasting of the muscles, menstrual irregularities, irritability, 
insomnia, and psychosis. Osteoporosis (bone thinning) is a common and 
particularly severe long-term side effect of prolonged steroid use.</p>  
Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by progressive loss of bone density, 
thinning of bone tissue, and increased vulnerability to fractures. Osteoporosis 
may result from disease, dietary or hormonal deficiency or advanced age. 
Regular exercise and vitamin and mineral supplements can reduce and even 
reverse loss of bone density.<br>

<p>No one should stop taking any steroids without consulting a doctor first. 
If the doctor orders steroids withdrawn, regular follow-up monitoring is 
necessary. Patients should talk to their doctor about ways to prevent adrenal 
insufficiency during withdrawal, particularly during stressful times when the 
risk increases.</p> 
<h3>Long-Term Relief Medications</h3> 
<p>These medications are taken on a regular basis to prevent asthma attacks 
and control chronic symptoms.</p> 
<h4>Inhaled Corticosteroids</h4> 
<p>Corticosteroids, also called glucocorticoids or steroids, are powerful 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids are not bronchodilators (they do not relax 
the airways) and have little short-term effect on symptoms. Instead, they work 
over time to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent injury in the lungs. 
They can also help prevent asthma attacks from occurring. The use of inhaled 
corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma reduces the risk of 
rehospitalization and death from asthma.</p> 
<p>Taking a corticosteroid drug through an inhaler makes it possible to 
provide effective local anti-inflammatory activity in the lungs with very few 
side effects elsewhere in the body. (By contrast, steroids taken by mouth have 
considerable side effects throughout the body.) Inhaled corticosteroids are 
recommended as the primary therapy for any patient needing long-term control 
medications for persistent asthma.</p> 
<p>Examples of inhaled corticosteroids: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>The most recent generation of inhaled steroids include fluticasone 
(Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), triamcinolone (Azmacort and others), 
flunisolide (AeroBid), mometasone furoate (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco). 
These steroids are sometimes combined with a long-acting beta2-agonist in a 
single inhaler, such as budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), 
fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair), and mometasone-formoterol (Dulera).</li> 
<li>The older corticosteroid inhalants are beclomethasone (Beclovent, 
Vanceril) and dexamethasone (Decadron Phosphate Respihaler and others).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Optimal timing of the dose is important and may vary depending on the 
medication.</p> 
<p>Inhaled steroids are generally considered safe and effective and only 
rarely cause any of the more serious side effects reported with prolonged use 
of oral steroids. The following are side effects of inhaled steroids:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The most common side effects are throat irritation, hoarseness, and dry 
mouth. Using a spacer device and rinsing the mouth after each treatment can 
minimize or prevent these effects.</li> 
<li>Rashes, wheezing, facial swelling (edema), fungal infections (thrush) in 
the mouth and throat, and bruising are also possible but not common with 
inhalators.</li> 
<li>Inhaled corticosteroids are associated with a higher risk for cataracts in 
patients over age 40, particularly with higher dosages. (No higher risk is 
observed in younger people.)</li> 
<li>Some studies report a higher risk for bone loss in patients who take 
inhaled steroids regularly, a side effect known to occur with oral steroids.
</li> </ul> 
<h4>Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists</h4> 
<p>Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are used for preventing an asthma attack 
(not for treating attack symptoms). These drugs should never be used alone in 
the treatment of asthma in adults or children. They can be dangerous when used 
alone, because they can mask asthma symptoms, and they can increase the risk of 
asthma death unless paired with an inhaled steroid. LABAs should only be used 
in combination with an asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled 
corticosteroid. LABAs should be used for the shortest time possible, and should 
only be used by patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by asthma 
controller medications.</p> 
<p>Salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair), formoterol-budesonide (Symbicort), and 
formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) are long-acting beta2 agonists products combined 
with a steroid in a single inhaler that are used for treatment of 
moderate-to-severe asthma. The LABA-only versions of these drugs are salmeterol 
(Serevent Diskus) and formoterol (Foradil Aerolizer).</p> 
<p>Doctors are still trying to determine when long-acting beta2-agonists 
should be added to an asthma treatment plan. If your symptoms do not improve or 
if symptoms worsen with this type of drug, your doctor will recommend 
discontinuing it. Do not, however, stop taking this drug or other asthma 
medications without first talking with your doctor.</p> 
<h4>Cromolyn</h4> 
<p>Cromolyn sodium (Intal) is both an anti-inflammatory drug and has 
antihistamine properties that block asthma triggers, such as allergens, cold, 
or exercise. A cromolyn nasal spray called NasalCrom has been approved for 
over-the-counter purchase, but only to relieve nasal congestion caused by 
allergies. Patients should not use it for self-medication without the advice of 
a doctor.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> Side effects of cromolyn include nasal congestion, 
coughing, sneezing, wheezing, nausea, nosebleeds, and dry throat.</p> 
<h4>Leukotriene Antagonists</h4> 
<p>Leukotriene antagonists (also called anti-leukotrienes or leukotriene 
modifiers) are pills that block leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are powerful immune 
system factors that, in excess, produce a battery of damaging chemicals that 
can cause inflammation and spasms in the airways of people with asthma. As with 
other anti-inflammatory drugs, leukotrienes are used for prevention, NOT for 
treating acute asthma attacks.</p> 
<p>Leukotriene antagonists include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast 
(Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). These drugs are considered an alternative for 
long-term control of asthma, but inhaled corticosteroids should always be used 
first. Other potential uses include preventing exercise-induced asthma.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects and Complications.</em> Gastrointestinal distress (stomach 
upset or pain) is the most common side effect of leukotriene antagonists. 
Zafirlukast may cause liver injury when taken at higher than standard doses. No 
adverse effects on the liver have been reported to date with montelukast.</p> 
<p>Mental health disturbances and behavioral changes have been associated with 
these medications. These mood problems include agitation, aggression, 
anxiousness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, depression, insomnia, 
irritability, restlessness, tremor, and suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Patients who take a leukotriene antagonist drug should be monitored for signs 
of behavioral and mood changes. Doctors should consider discontinuing the drug 
if patients exhibit any of these symptoms.</p> 
<h4>Omalizumab</h4> 
<p>Omalizumab (Xolair) is FDA-approved for patients age 12 and older who have 
moderate-to-severe persistent asthma related to allergies. Omalizumab is a 
biologic drug that targets and blocks the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE), a 
chemical trigger of the inflammatory events associated with an allergic asthma 
attack.</p> 
<p>Omalizumab is given by injection every 2 - 4 weeks. It is used only to 
treat patients who have moderate-to-severe persistent asthma related to 
allergies whose symptoms are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects and Complications</em>. About 1 in 1,000 patients who take 
omalizumab develop anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction). Patients 
can develop anaphylaxis after any dose of omalizumab, even if they had no 
reaction to a first dose. Anaphylaxis may occur up to 24 hours after the dose 
is given.</p> 
<p>Omalizumab should always be injected in a doctor's office, and health care 
providers should observe patients for at least 2 hours after an injection. 
Patients should also carry emergency self-treatment for anaphylaxis (such as an 
Epi-Pen) and know how to use it. With an Epi-Pen, or similar auto-injector 
device, patients can quickly give themselves a life-saving dose of epinephrine.
</p> 
<p>Anaphylaxis symptoms include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Difficulty breathing </li> 
<li>Chest tightness </li> 
<li>Dizziness </li> 
<li>Fainting </li> 
<li>Itching and hives </li> 
<li>Swelling of the mouth and throat</li> </ul> 
<p>The FDA is currently reviewing whether omalizumab may be associated with 
increased risk for heart and vascular problems (ischemic heart disease, 
arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and blood 
clots).</p> 
<h4>Theophylline</h4> 
<p>Theophylline relaxes the muscles around the bronchioles and also stimulates 
breathing. Since the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting 
beta2-agonists, theophylline is not used as often for asthma treatment. It may 
still be used in some circumstances, such as for treating nocturnal asthma. 
Theophylline is available in tablet, liquid, and injectable forms. Theophylline 
should not be used by people with peptic ulcers, and should be used with 
caution by anyone with heart disease, liver disease, high blood pressure, or 
seizure disorders.</p> 
<h3>Other Treatments</h3> 
<h4>Immunizations</h4> 
<p>Patients with asthma should get an annual flu vaccine, and they should 
receive the vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia at least once. [For more 
information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #94: Colds and influenza.] </p> 
<h4>Treating Seasonal Allergies and Sinusitis</h4> 
<p>Patients with asthma and chronic allergic rhinitis may need to take 
medications daily. Patients with severe seasonal allergies may need to start 
medications a few weeks before the pollen season, and to continue medicine 
until the season is over.</p> 
<p>Immunotherapy (&quot;allergy shots&quot;) may help reduce asthma symptoms, 
and the use of asthma medications, in patients with known allergies. They may 
also help prevent the development of asthma in children with allergies. 
Immunotherapy poses some risk for severe allergic reactions, however, 
especially for children with poorly controlled asthma.</p> 
<p>Treatment of allergies and sinusitis can help control asthma. </p> 
<p>[For more information, see <em>In-Depth Reports</em> #77: Allergic rhinitis
, #5:Asthma in children and adolescents, and #62: Sinusitis.] </p> 
<h4>Preventing and Treating Respiratory Infections</h4> 
<p>Respiratory infections, including the common cold, can interact with 
allergies to worsen asthma. People with asthma should try to minimize their 
risk for respiratory tract infections. Washing hands is a very simple but 
effective preventive measure.</p> 
<h4>Treating Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</h4> 
<p>Patients with obvious symptoms of reflux (heartburn) may consider the 
following lifestyle changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoiding heavy meals and meals with fried food </li> 
<li>Avoiding caffeine, chocolate, onions, and garlic </li> 
<li>Avoiding eating or drinking at least 3 hours before bedtime </li> 
<li>Elevating the head of the bed by 6 inches </li> 
<li>Taking medications to treat gastroesophageal reflux. Be sure to talk to 
your doctor before taking these medicines.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Managing Hormonal-Related Asthma</h4> 
<p>Women who suspect that menstrual-related changes may influence asthma 
severity should keep a diary of their menstrual dates and times of asthma 
attacks. Sometimes, adjusting medications in anticipation of menstruation may 
help prevent attacks.</p> 
<h4>Other Treatments</h4> 
<p>Children, adolescents, and adults with asthma are widely using alternative 
therapies. In one study, nearly half of asthma or allergy sufferers resorted to 
alternative treatments. To date, however, evidence does not support any value 
from most alternative therapies, including high-dose vitamins, urine 
injections, homeopathic remedies, and most herbal remedies.</p> 
<p><i>Relaxation and Stress-Reduction Techniques.</i> Some patients report 
benefits from many stress reduction techniques, such as acupuncture, hypnosis, 
breathing relaxation techniques, massage therapy, and meditation practices. 
There have been very few well-conducted studies supporting their use, however.
</p>  Acupuncture, hypnosis and biofeedback are all alternative ways to control 
pain. Acupuncture involves the insertion of tiny sterile needles, slightly 
thicker than a human hair, at specific points on the body.<br>

<p><i>Breathing Exercises.</i> Breathing exercises may help improve 
patients&rsquo; quality of life even if they do not have a major impact on 
medication reduction.</p> 
<p><i>Probiotics.</i> Probiotics are beneficial microbes that some believe may 
help protect against allergies and asthma. Probiotics can be obtained in active 
yogurt cultures and supplements, which are being studied for protection. 
However, evidence to date does not support efficacy in preventing or treating 
asthma.</p> 
<p><i>Herbal Remedies.</i> Few rigorous studies have evaluated herbal remedies 
for asthma. Manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not 
need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and 
supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential 
to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a number of 
reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. 
Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary 
supplements.</p> 
<h3>Managing Asthma at Home</h3> 
<h4>Asthma Action Plans</h4> 
<p>Asthma action plans create a written document for patients to manage asthma 
during stable times and to more easily identify when asthma is worsening. 
Important components of a home program include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A clearly written plan for taking asthma medications when condition is 
stable</li> 
<li>A complete education regarding the difference between long-term control 
medications and quick-relief medications</li> 
<li>Monitoring of asthma on a daily basis. Symptom monitoring is adequate for 
patients with intermittent or mild persistent asthma. Peak flow monitoring 
should be performed in patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma or 
those with a history of more severe exacerbations (sudden worsening or increase 
in severity of symptoms).</li> 
<li>A list of environmental control measures that need to be taken </li> 
<li>When to seek medical care</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Managing Asthma Exacerbations</em>. Always refer to the written action 
plan from your doctors and nurses. Treatment approaches generally include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Recognizing symptoms and measuring peak flow </li> 
<li>Using for the first time or increasing usage of short-acting medications 
</li> 
<li>Eliminating or withdrawing from any triggers or irritants that may be 
responsible for increase in severity of symptoms</li> 
<li>Depending on written instructions from doctor, beginning oral 
corticosteroids</li> 
<li>Monitoring response to treatments and communicating with doctor if 
symptoms worsen or if severe symptoms occur. [See: &quot;Symptoms&quot; 
section.]</li> </ul> 
<p>Follow-up generally depends on the severity of asthma, how recently asthma 
was diagnosed, patient compliance, and whether recent changes in treatment were 
made.</p> 
<h4>Avoiding Environmental Triggers</h4> 
<p>It is important to avoid and control triggers that lead to asthma attacks. 
</p> 
<p><i>Controlling Pets.</i> Patients who already have pets and are not 
allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing allergies. If pets 
trigger asthma, take the following precautions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If possible, keep pets outside </li> 
<li>If this isn't possible, confine pets to carpet-free areas outside the 
bedroom. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on 
clothing. Dogs usually cause fewer problems.</li> 
<li>Wash animals once a week to reduce allergens. Dry shampoos, available for 
both cats and dogs, can remove allergens from the skin and fur and are easier 
to administer than wet shampoos.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Controlling for Dust.</i> Spray furniture polish is very effective for 
reducing both dust and allergens. Air cleaners, filters for air conditioners, 
and vacuum cleaners with High Efficiency Particle Arresting (HEPA) filters can 
help remove particles and small allergens found indoors. Neither vacuuming nor 
the use of anti-mite carpet shampoo, however, is effective in removing mites in 
house dust. In fact, vacuuming stirs up both mites and cat allergens. If 
possible, avoid carpets and rugs.</p>  A High Efficiency Particle Arresting 
(HEPA) filter can remove the majority of harmful particles, including mold 
spores, dust, dust mites, pet dander and other irritating allergens from the 
air. Along with other methods to reduce allergens, such as frequent dusting, 
the use of a HEPA filtration system can help control the amount of allergens 
circulating in the air. HEPA filters can be found in most air purifiers, which 
are usually small and portable.<br>

<p><i>Bedding, Curtains, and Bedroom Environment.</i> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Replace curtains with shades or blinds, and wash bedding using the highest 
temperature setting.</li> 
<li>Encase mattress and pillows in special dust mite proof covers (synthetic 
pillows may pose a higher risk for asthma attacks than feather pillows, or no 
pillow at all).</li> 
<li>Wash pillows in water hotter than 150 &deg;F, or in cooler water with 
detergent and bleach.</li> 
<li>Wash sheets and blankets weekly in hot water. </li> 
<li>Avoid sleeping or lying on cushions or furniture that are cloth covered.
</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Reducing Humidity in the House.</i> Living in a damp house is 
counterproductive. Dust mites thrive in humidity and damp houses increase the 
risk for mold. Humidity levels should not exceed 30 - 50%:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fix all leaky faucets and pipes, and eliminate collections of water around 
the outside of the house.</li> 
<li>Dehumidify basements, but empty humidifiers and clean them daily with a 
vinegar solution.</li> 
<li>Clean often any moldy surfaces in the basement or in other areas of the 
home.</li> 
<li>Avoid prolonged used of vaporizers to manage symptoms during asthma 
attacks.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Gas Stoves, Kerosene, and Cooking.</i> Electric stoves and ovens are 
healthier than gas ones for people with asthma. Gas ovens release nitrogen 
dioxide, a substance that can aggravate asthma symptoms. Even smoky cooking can 
worsen asthma. Kerosene (used in space heaters and lamps) may also produce 
allergic reactions.</p> 
<p><i>Exterminating Pests (Cockroaches and Mice).</i> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a professional exterminator to eliminate cockroaches. (Cleaning the 
house using standard housecleaning techniques may not eliminate the cockroach 
allergens.)</li> 
<li>Exterminate mice and attempt to remove all dust, which might contain mouse 
urine and dander.</li> 
<li>Keep food and garbage in closed containers. </li> 
<li>Keep food out of bedrooms.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Avoiding Cigarette Smoke.</i> Cigarette smoke can accelerate the decline 
in lung function related to asthma. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can 
double the risk of asthma-related emergency room visits. Everyone should quit 
smoking and encourage others around them to quit. [For help quitting, see<em>
In-Depth Report</em> #41: Smoking<em>.</em>] </p> <br>
<br>
 Click the icon to 
see an image of common asthma triggers. 
<p><i>Avoiding Outdoor Allergens.</i> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid scheduling camping and hiking trips during times of high pollen 
count (generally, May and June for grass pollen and mid-August to October for 
ragweed).</li> 
<li>Avoid strenuous activity when ozone levels are highest, which usually 
occur in early afternoon, particularly on hot hazy summer days. Levels are 
lowest in early morning and at dusk.</li> 
<li>Asthma attacks are often triggered by thunderstorms. It is not clear why. 
Some evidence points to a build-up of ozone that accompanies such storms.</li> 
<li>Patients who are allergic to mold should avoid barns, hay, raking leaves, 
and mowing grass. Exposure to automobile fumes may worsen asthma. Fungi in car 
air conditioners can also be a problem.</li> 
<li>Air pollution can worsen asthma.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<h4>Exercise</h4> 
<p>Asthma is no reason to avoid exercise. Historically, about 10% of Olympic 
athletes have asthma. Some studies indicate that long-term exercise even helps 
control asthma and reduce hospitalization. Exercise can help control weight, 
which can help with asthma symptoms. Patients should consult their doctors 
before starting any exercise program, however.</p> 
<p>People who enjoy running should probably choose an indoor track to avoid 
pollutants. Swimming is excellent for people with asthma. Yoga, which uses 
stretching, breathing, and meditation techniques, may have particular benefits.
</p> 
<p><em>Hints for Reducing Exercise Induced Asthma (EIA)</em>. EIA occurs only 
after exercise and is more likely to happen during regular paced activities in 
cold, dry air. The following are some suggestions for reducing its impact:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Comply with long-term control medications, particularly inhaled 
corticosteroids, when prescribed.</li> 
<li>Warm-up and cool-down before and after exercise. </li> 
<li>Participate in activities with short bursts of exercise (such as tennis 
and football) rather than exercises involving long-duration pacing (such as 
cycling, soccer, and distance running).</li> 
<li>Breathe through a scarf or through the nose. This helps warm up the 
airways when exercising in cold air.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Medications</em>. </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Short-acting beta2-agonists taken before exercise are generally considered 
the first choice, and they last for 2 - 3 hours.</li> 
<li>Cromolyn is another option but it is not as effective. </li> 
<li>Leukotriene antagonists are another option, but they generally take hours 
to be effective.</li> </ul> <br>
