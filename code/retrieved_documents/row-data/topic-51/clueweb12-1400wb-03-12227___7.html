How To Use This Medicine 
<p> Take this medication exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been 
prescribed by your doctor. Do not use the medication in larger amounts, or use 
it for longer than recommended. </p> 
<p>  An overdose of ibuprofen can cause damage to your stomach or intestines. 
The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 
mg per day (4 maximum doses). Use only the smallest amount of ibuprofen needed 
to get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever.</p> 
<p> Take ibuprofen with food or milk to lessen stomach upset. </p> 
<p> Shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. To 
be sure you get the correct dose, measure the liquid with a marked measuring 
spoon or medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a 
dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p> 
<p> The ibuprofen chewable tablet must be chewed before you swallow it. </p> 
<p> If you take ibuprofen for a long period of time, your doctor may want to 
check you on a regular basis to make sure this medication is not causing 
harmful effects. Do not miss any scheduled visits to your doctor.</p> 
<p> Store ibuprofen at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not 
allow the liquid medicine to freeze.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> <br>
<br>
Discuss With Your Doctor 
<p>  Taking an NSAID can increase your risk of life-threatening heart or 
circulation problems, including heart attack or stroke. This risk will increase 
the longer you use an NSAID. Do not use this medicine just before or after 
having heart bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).
</p> 
<p>  NSAIDs can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach or 
intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These 
conditions can be fatal and gastrointestinal effects can occur without warning 
at any time while you are taking an NSAID. Older adults may have an even 
greater risk of these serious gastrointestinal side effects.</p> 
<p>  Do not use this medication if you are allergic to ibuprofen, aspirin or 
other NSAIDs. </p> 
<p>  Before taking ibuprofen, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any 
drugs, or if you have: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> History of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot</li> 
<li> Heart disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure</li> 
<li> History of stomach ulcers or bleeding</li> 
<li> Asthma</li> 
<li> Polyps in your nose</li> 
<li> Liver or kidney disease</li> 
<li> Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</li> 
<li> Bleeding or blood clotting disorder</li> 
<li> If you smoke</li> </ul> 
<p> If you have any of these conditions, you may not be able to use ibuprofen, 
or you may need a dosage adjustment or special tests during treatment.</p> 
<p> If you are taking aspirin to prevent heart attack or stroke, avoid also 
taking ibuprofen. Ibuprofen may make aspirin less effective in protecting your 
heart and blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the ibuprofen 
at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric 
coated form).</p> 
<p> This medication is not expected to be harmful to an unborn baby during 
early pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become 
pregnant during treatment. However, taking ibuprofen during the last 3 months 
of pregnancy may result in birth defects. Do not take ibuprofen during 
pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to.</p> 
<p> It is not known whether ibuprofen passes into breast milk or if it could 
harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if 
you are breast-feeding a baby.</p> 
<p>  Do not give this medicine to a child without the advice of a doctor. </p> 
<br> <br>

<p> </p> <br>
<br>
If You Miss A Dose 
<p> Since ibuprofen is sometimes taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing 
schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as 
soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed 
dose and wait until your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take extra 
medicine to make up the missed dose.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> <br>
<br>
In Case of Overdose 
<p>  Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have taken too much of 
this medication. Symptoms of a fluoxetine overdose may include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Nausea</li> 
<li> Vomiting</li> 
<li> Fever</li> 
<li> Sleepiness</li> 
<li> Rapid or uneven Heartbeat</li> 
<li> Confusion</li> 
<li> Fainting</li> 
<li> Seizures</li> 
<li> Coma</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> <br>
<br>
What To Avoid 
<p>  Avoid taking ibuprofen if you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or 
heart attack. Ibuprofen can make aspirin less effective in protecting your 
heart and blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the ibuprofen 
at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric 
coated form).</p> 
<p>  Do not use any other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medication 
without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Many medicines available over 
the counter contain aspirin or other medicines similar to ibuprofen (such as 
ketoprofen or naproxen). If you take certain products together you may 
accidentally take too much of this type of medication. Read the label of any 
other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, 
ketoprofen, or naproxen.</p> 
<p>  Do not drink alcohol while taking ibuprofen. Alcohol can increase the 
risk of stomach bleeding caused by ibuprofen.</p> 
<p>  Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning 
beds). Ibuprofen can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may 
result. Use a sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) and wear protective clothing if you 
must be out in the sun.</p> <br>
<br>
