<h2> How is erythema nodosum treated?</h2> 
<p> Erythema nodosum may be very uncomfortable, but it tends to clear up on 
its own, usually resolving over a period of six weeks. Nevertheless, it can 
sometimes recur. Following your treatment plan for any existing underlying 
disorder can help reduce your chances of experiencing a recurrence of erythema 
nodosum. In the meantime, pain-relieving medication can help ease symptoms.</p> 
<h3> Most common symptomatic relief agents</h3> 
<p> A common choice for pain management is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID). However, NSAIDs should be avoided if you also have Crohn&rsquo;s 
disease, because the NSAID can trigger a flare-up or make the Crohn&rsquo;s 
disease worse. Some common symptomatic relief agents include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) or naproxen (Aleve, 
Anaprox, Naprosyn)</li> 
<li> Salicylic acids, such as aspirin (Ascriptin, Bayer, Ecotrin), diflunisal 
(Dolobid), or salsalate (Disalcid, Salflex)</li> </ul> 
<h3> Additional symptomatic relief agents</h3> 
<p> Depending on the primary cause of your erythema nodosum, additional agents 
or alternatives to NSAIDs might include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Potassium iodide, taken as a solution for four weeks, may provide relief 
by reducing the nodules if it is started as soon as possible after the onset of 
erythema nodosum</li> 
<li> Systemic steroids such as oral prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred) are a 
safe option as long as malignancy, underlying infection, and risk of sepsis 
have been ruled out</li> </ul> 
<h3> What you can do to improve your erythema nodosum</h3> 
<p> In addition to taking pain medications as directed and following your 
treatment plan for any existing primary cause, you may also find additional 
pain relief by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Applying hot or cold compresses</li> 
<li> Avoiding activities that aggravate your pain until symptoms subside</li> 
</ul> 
<h2> What are the potential complications of erythema nodosum?</h2> 
<p> There are no known complications of erythema nodosum itself. The condition 
usually resolves on its own within six weeks. However, delaying or avoiding 
treatment of any identified cause or primary disorder may result in 
complications specific to that disorder. You can help minimize your risk of 
serious complications by following the treatment plan you and your health care 
professional design specifically for you.</p>

INTRODUCTION 
<h2> What is erythema nodosum?</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Erythema nodosum is a painful inflammation of the fat beneath the 
skin&rsquo;s surface. It is characterized by lumps or nodules beneath the skin 
that are about an inch across and are firm, red, and warm to the touch. Over 
the course of several days, the lumps may turn a purplish color and then fade 
over the next several weeks. They usually appear on the shins but may also

SYMPTOMS 
<h2> What are the symptoms of erythema nodosum?</h2> 
<p> Symptoms of erythema nodosum consist of lumps or nodules under the skin 
that are usually about an inch across and are firm, red, warm, and sensitive to 
the touch. Over the course of a few days, they may turn a purplish color and 
then fade over the next several weeks. They usually appear on the shins but may 
also occur on other parts of your body, such as your arms, legs and buttocks. 
Many people experience painful joints, unexplained weight loss, low-gradefever, 
and a general feeling of malaise or lethargy as early as one to three weeks...

<h2> What causes erythema nodosum?</h2> 
<p> In more than half of all cases, the exact cause of erythema nodosum is not 
known, but it has been linked to a variety of other infections, most commonly 
strep throat. Less often, it can be the first sign of a systemic disease, such 
as tuberculosis,inflammatory bowel disease, bacterial or deep fungal infection, 
sarcoidosis (inflammatory disease most commonly affecting the lungs, skin and 
eyes), or, rarely, cancer. It can also be a reaction to medications, such as
antibiotics or oral contraceptives....  Read more about erythema nodosum causes
