<p>When your child&rsquo;s feeling under the weather, there&rsquo;s only one 
thing you want to do &ndash; make him feel better as soon as possible. But it 
can be hard to know what kind of medication to give and when.</p> 
<h2>did you know</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Adult medicine isn&rsquo;t suitable for children &ndash; their small 
bodies&nbsp;are very sensitive to&nbsp;medicine, and they need medications that 
have been&nbsp;specifically designed for their size and their needs.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Until your baby is six months old, don&rsquo;t give him any medicine at 
all (unless prescribed by a doctor).</li> </ul>

<h3>Paracetamol</h3> 
<p>Paracetamol is often used to relieve pain or to lower a child&rsquo;s fever.
<strong>A high fever can make your&nbsp;child irritable</strong>,&nbsp;so 
medicine can be used to lower his temperature if he&rsquo;s really 
uncomfortable.<strong></strong></p> 
<p>If your child has a fever, her body&rsquo;s probably fighting an infection, 
and medicine might slow down this process. It&rsquo;s more important to monitor 
other symptoms, such as vomiting and coughing, than just looking at her 
temperature.</p> 
<p>Paracetamol is <strong>safe if you follow the recommended doses</strong>, 
but an overdose can cause liver failure. Also, giving paracetamol to a child 
under one year of age has been shown to increase the risk of asthma. Speak to 
your doctor for further information on suitable medication options for your 
child.</p> 
<p>Paracetamol for children comes in different strengths and varieties, so 
<strong>read the label and follow the instructions carefully</strong>. Make 
sure you give your child the right amount for his weight.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen&nbsp;is a safe alternative to paracetamol, but avoid it if your 
child is vomiting or has asthma.</p>  Aspirin should never be given to young 
children, because there&rsquo;s a strong possibility of serious side effects. 
<h3>Antibiotics</h3> 
<p><strong>Antibiotics work only on bacterial infections, not on viruses.
</strong> Research suggests that children with viral infections such as colds 
or the flu are being prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily. Using antibiotics 
incorrectly can lead to side effects such asdiarrhoea, dehydration&nbsp;and 
allergies.</p> 
<p>Your doctor has many different antibiotics to choose from. Some are 
effective against only certain types of bacteria. Others target a broad range 
of bacteria and are called &lsquo;broad-spectrum antibiotics&rsquo;. Your 
doctor will try to choose the right antibiotic to fight the bacteria infecting 
your child. The doctor might also need to order some tests to find out what 
type of bacteria is causing&nbsp;your child&rsquo;s&nbsp;infection.</p> 
<p>The decision to use antibiotics depends on your doctor, and your 
child&rsquo;s symptoms and medical history. If your child needs to take 
antibiotics, she should<strong>complete the entire course</strong> of 
antibiotics, even if she seems better after a few days. Infection might come 
back a week or two later if the bacteria aren&rsquo;t completely gone from her 
system.</p> 
<h3>Decongestants</h3> 
<p>Many parents give their children decongestants to relieve cold and flu 
symptoms, but there&rsquo;s little evidence that these actually work.</p> 
<p>In fact, <strong>coughing</strong> is actually a great way to clear mucus 
from airways, and helps prevent children from getting another infection. Also,
<strong>drinking plenty of water</strong> does more to relieve a cough than 
medicine &ndash; but do see your doctor if the cough persists, or seems 
particularly bad.</p> 
<p>Decongestants might cause <strong>unpleasant side effects</strong> like 
grumpiness, confusion and sleepiness.</p> 
<h3>
<p>Antihistamines</p></h3> 
<p>Itching, sneezing, swelling or rashes can all be symptoms of allergies. 
Medications known asantihistamines&nbsp;are used to block these symptoms.</p> 
<p>Antihistamines can sometimes cause dry mouths, drowsiness and upset 
stomachs. Some brands don&rsquo;t have a sedating effect (for example, Zyrtec 
and Claratyne) and are more suitable for your child. Antihistamines can be 
given with any antibiotic, paracetamol (such as Panadol), ibuprofen (such as 
Nurofen), decongestants or cough suppressants.</p> 
<p>They can&rsquo;t be used to treat croup&nbsp;because they&rsquo;ll dry out 
your child&rsquo;s air passages.</p>  Children under two years shouldn&rsquo;t 
be given anithistamines. Also, antihistamines aren&rsquo;t recommended for 
long-term use, so check with your doctor before giving them to your child. 
<p><strong>Phenergan</strong><br>
 Some parents give their children 
antihistamines, such as Phenergan (which is one of a few brands of the drug 
promethazine), to help them sleep. Research shows that<strong>antihistamines 
have almost no effect on children&rsquo;s sleep patterns</strong>. If 
you&rsquo;re having trouble getting your child to sleep, ourguide to solving 
sleep problems&nbsp;might help.</p> 
<p>You might be thinking about giving your child medication to calm difficult 
behaviour. These medications sometimes cause drowsiness, so they might also 
affect his ability to learn. On the other hand, they cause some children to 
become more active and alert.</p>  If you&rsquo;re thinking about giving your 
child medicine for sleep or behaviour problems, always talk to your doctor 
first about what&rsquo;s safe and what will work. You can also find more 
information in our article onpills, potions and tonics for sleep. <br>

<h3>Medicines to avoid</h3> 
<p>Think very carefully before giving your child any medicine that 
hasn&rsquo;t been prescribed by a doctor.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Aspirin</strong> can make your child susceptible to Reye&rsquo;s 
syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness. It can also cause serious 
illness or even death in children with chicken pox or flu symptoms. Not all 
over-the-counter medicines are aspirin-free, so you need to check this with 
your pharmacist or doctor, or read the label. Aspirin is sometimes referred to 
as &lsquo;salicylate&rsquo; or &lsquo;acetylsalicylic acid&rsquo;.</li> 
<li><strong>Anti-nausea medications</strong> have risks and possible 
complications. Don&rsquo;t give your child anti-nausea medication unless the 
doctor specifically recommends it. Usuallyvomiting&nbsp;is pretty short-lived, 
and children can handle it without medication. If your child is vomiting and 
begins to get dehydrated, contact your doctor immediately.</li> 
<li>If your child&nbsp;is already taking prescribed medicine, it&rsquo;s best 
to check with your doctor before giving her any paracetamol&nbsp;or ibuprofen. 
Paracetamol or ibuprofen are found in many over-the-counter cough and cold 
medicines, so it pays to read the label carefully.</li> 
<li>Oral decongestants like Dimetapp Elixir and Demazin Syrup aren&rsquo;t 
recommended for children under two years of age.</li> 
<li>Adult medications or medication prescribed for someone else might harm 
your child. It&rsquo;s never safe to give these to your child.</li> 
<li>Expired medicine doesn&rsquo;t work and can even be harmful.</li> 
<li>Chewable tablets are too small to give to your child &ndash; he can 
easily&nbsp;choke on them.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what&rsquo;s in a particular medicine, ask the 
pharmacist or your child&rsquo;s doctor.</p>  Mixing prescription medicine and 
over-the-counter medicine from a pharmacist can be very dangerous. Always check 
with your doctor or pharmacist first. 
<h3>Vitamins: a good idea?</h3> 
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that vitamin and mineral supplements help 
children&rsquo;s health in any way unless the child has a deficiency of some 
kind &ndash; and very few children suffer from these deficiencies. Check with 
your doctor if you think this might be the case with your child.</p> 
<p>You might also like to read our article on vitamins and minerals.</p> 
<h3>What to ask your doctor and pharmacist</h3> 
<p>When your doctor prescribes medicine for your child, you might like to ask:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the medicine prescribed for?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;Will it have side effects?&rsquo; (For example, high doses of 
vitamins A and D can accumulate in the body&nbsp;and cause&nbsp;side effects.)
</li> 
<li>&lsquo;How soon will it start to work?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;How much should I give my child, and how should I give it to 
her?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;Should I give the medicine at any specific time, like before or 
after food?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;How long should the prescription last?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;Will the medicine interact or interfere with anything else my child 
is taking?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;Does the medicine need to be kept in the fridge or away from light 
or heat?&rsquo;</li> 
<li>&lsquo;Can I put the medicine in food, or should I be giving my child 
certain foods with the medicine?&rsquo;</li> </ul>  If you&rsquo;re getting 
over-the-counter medicine from the chemist, you should ask the pharmacist all 
the questions above. Also ask whether the medicine is safe for your child, how 
long you should wait to visit your doctor if problems don&rsquo;t go away, and 
whether there&rsquo;s any alcohol or aspirin in the ingredients.
