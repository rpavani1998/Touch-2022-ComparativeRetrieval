 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
periodontal disease. Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>Symptoms of Periodontal Disease</strong></p> 
<p>Symptoms of periodontal disease include red and swollen gums, persistent 
bad breath, and gum recession and loose teeth. Smoking, certain types of 
illnesses (diabetes), older age, and other factors increase the risk for 
periodontal disease. If you have periodontal disease, your dentist may refer 
you to a periodontist, a dentist who specializes in treating this condition.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Good Dental Hygiene</strong></p> 
<p>Consistent good dental hygiene can help prevent gingivitis and 
periodontitis. The American Dental Association recommends that everyone:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Brush twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste (be sure to replace 
toothbrushes every 3 - 4 months).</li> 
<li>Clean between the teeth with floss or an interdental cleaner.</li> 
<li>Eat a well-balanced diet and limit between meal snacks.</li> 
<li>Have regular visits with a dentist for teeth cleaning and oral 
examinations.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Mouthwashes</strong></p> 
<p>According to the American Dental Association, antimicrobial mouthwashes may 
provide additional oral health benefits for preventing and reducing gingivitis 
and plaque. However, they are not a substitute for daily brushing and flossing.
</p> 
<p><strong>Complications</strong></p> 
<p>Uncontrolled periodontal disease is associated with:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tooth loss</li> 
<li>Bad breath</li> 
<li>Heart problems such as heart disease and stroke</li> 
<li>Diabetes</li> 
<li>Respiratory diseases</li> 
<li>Premature delivery and low birth weight</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Introduction 
<p>Periodontal disease refers to a group of problems that arise in the sulcus, 
the gap between the gum and the tooth.</p> 
<h3>What is the Periodontium?</h3> 
<p>The part of the mouth that consists of the gum and supporting structures is 
called the periodontium. It is made up of the following parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gum (<i>gingiva</i>). When healthy, the gingiva is pale pink, firm, and 
does not move. It has a smooth or speckled texture. The gingival tissue between 
teeth is shaped like a wedge.</li> 
<li>The space between the gum and tooth, called the <i>sulcus</i></li> 
<li>Root surface (the <i>cementum</i>)</li> 
<li>Connective tissue</li> 
<li>Bone. The crest of the supporting bone, which can be viewed on x-rays, is 
normally 2 mm below the point where the crown of the tooth meets the root (the 
cementoenamel junction).</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<h3>Periodontal Disease</h3> 
<p>Periodontal diseases are generally divided into two groups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gingivitis, which causes lesions (wounds) that affect the gums</li> 
<li>Periodontitis, which damages the bone and connective tissue that supports 
the teeth</li> </ul> 
<p>The process starts with bacteria. Even in healthy mouths, the sulcus is 
teeming with bacteria, but they tend to be harmless varieties. Periodontal 
disease develops usually because of two events in the oral cavity: an increase 
in bacteria quantity and a change in balance of bacterial types from harmless 
to disease-causing bacteria. These harmful bacteria increase in mass and 
thickness until they form a film called<i>plaque</i>.</p> Click the icon to see 
an image of plaque and damaged gum tissue. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>In healthy mouths, plaque itself actually provides some barrier against 
outside bacterial invasion. When it accumulates to excessive levels, however, 
plaque sticks to the surfaces of the teeth and adjacent gums and causes 
cellular injury, with subsequent swelling, redness, and heat.</p> 
<p>When plaque is allowed to remain in the periodontal area, it transforms into
<i>calculus</i> (commonly known as <em>tartar</em> ). This material has a 
rock-like consistency and grabs onto the tooth surface. It is much more 
difficult to remove than plaque, which is a soft mass.</p> 
<p>The most important component leading to the disease process, however, is 
the body's persistent immune response to the bacterial plaque. Specific immune 
factors are released that cause inflammation and damage that eventually 
destroys the support structures and bone and can lead to tooth loss.</p> 
<h3>Gingivitis</h3> 
<p>Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gingiva, or gums. Is nearly always 
chronic, but an acute form infrequently occurs.</p> 
<p><i>Chronic Gingivitis</i>. Ordinary chronic gingivitis affects over 90% of 
the population. It is characterized by tender, red, swollen gums that bleed 
easily and may be responsible for bad breath (<i>halitosis</i>) in some cases. 
Treatment is very effective if initiated early in the course of gingivitis. 
Without good management, however, the problem can progress.</p> 
<h3>Periodontitis</h3> 
<p>Periodontitis is characterized by the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gum inflammation, with redness and bleeding</li> 
<li>Deep pockets (greater than 3 mm in depth) that form between the gum and 
the tooth</li> 
<li>Loose teeth, caused by loss of connective tissue structures and bone</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Gingivitis precedes periodontitis, although it doesn't always lead to this 
more severe condition. In fact, some research suggests it is an entirely 
different disease. There are different categories of periodontal disease, 
including:</p> 
<p><i>Chronic Periodontitis.</i> Chronic periodontitis (also referred to as 
adult periodontitis) may begin in adolescence as a slowly progressing disease 
that becomes clinically significant in the mid-30s and continues throughout 
life. Some dentists question whether it is a chronic, unrelenting condition and 
instead suggest that it waxes and wanes depending on the response of the immune 
system.</p> 
<p><i>Aggressive Periodontitis.</i> Aggressive periodontitis (also referred to 
as early onset periodontitis) often occurs in young people. It is subdivided 
according to whether it begins before or after puberty. Immune deficiencies and 
a genetic link have been shown to be possible factors for all types of 
aggressive periodontitis. If the condition is localized and treated, the 
outlook is positive. People with severe and widespread aggressive periodontitis 
are at high risk for tooth loss.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Periodontitis that occurs before puberty is very rare. It begins with the 
eruption of primary teeth in the first year and causes severe inflammation and 
bone and tooth loss.</li> 
<li>Juvenile periodontitis begins at puberty and is defined by severe bone 
loss around the first molars and incisors. It is more common in girls than in 
boys. The clinical signs -- such as inflammation, bleeding, and heavy plaque 
accumulation -- are not present in this relatively rare disease. The treatment 
is the same as in chronic periodontitis.</li> 
<li>Rapidly progressive periodontitis occurs in the early 20s to mid-30s. 
Severe inflammation and rapid bone and connective tissue loss occur, and tooth 
loss is possible within a year of onset.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Disease-Related Periodontitis.</i> Periodontitis can also be associated 
with a number of systemic diseases, including type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, 
AIDS, and several rare disorders of white blood cells.</p> 
<p><i>Acute Necrotizing Periodontal Disease.</i> Acute necrotizing periodontal 
disease is an acute infection in the gums. It is characterized by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Black, dead tissue (necrosis)</li> 
<li>Spontaneous bleeding</li> 
<li>Rapid onset of pain</li> 
<li>Bad odor</li> 
<li>Blunted gum tissue (tissue is normally cone-shaped)</li> </ul> 
<p>Stress, poor diet, smoking, and viral infections are predisposing factors 
for this acute necrotizing periodontal disease.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Symptoms 
<p>In general, symptoms progress over time and include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Red and Swollen Gums</i></li> 
<li><i>Gum Bleeding.</i> Bleeding of the gums, even during brushing, is a sign 
of inflammation and the major marker of periodontal disease. One exception is 
juvenile periodontitis, in which symptoms are mild or even absent. It should be 
noted that the gums of smokers with periodontal disease tend to bleed less than 
nonsmokers.</li> 
<li><i>Bad Breath.</i> Debris and bacteria can cause a bad taste in the mouth 
and persistent bad breath.</li> 
<li><i>Gum Recession and Loose Teeth.</i> As the disease advances the gums 
recede, and supporting structure of bone is lost. Teeth loosen, sometimes 
causing a change in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together when biting 
down or how partial dentures fit.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

image of recessed gums. <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><i>Abscesses.</i> Deepening periodontal pockets between the gums and bone 
can become blocked by tartar or food particles. Infection-fighting white blood 
cells become trapped and die. Pus forms, and an abscess develops. Abscesses can 
destroy both gum and tooth tissue, cause nearby teeth to become loose and 
painful, and may cause fever and swollen lymph nodes.</li> </ul> Click the icon 
to see an image of a tooth abscess. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Pain is usually not a symptom, which partly explains why the disease may 
become advanced before treatment is sought and why some patients avoid 
treatment even after periodontitis is diagnosed.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>Periodontal disease is marked by bacterial overgrowth. However, a 
persistent immune response to chronic infections in the mouth is believed to 
play a major role in gum destruction.</p> 
<h3>Bacterial Culprits</h3> 
<p>Reachers have found more than 350 species of microorganisms in the typical 
healthy mouth. Periodontal infections are linked to fewer than 5% of these 
species. Healthy and disease-causing bacteria can generally be grouped into two 
categories:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The harmless or helpful bacteria are usually known as <i>gram positive 
aerobic bacteria</i>.</li> 
<li>In periodontal disease, the bacterial balance shifts over to <i>gram 
negative anaerobic bacteria</i>. Inflammatory disease and injury cannot develop 
without these bacteria.</li> </ul> 
<p>Following are some of the bacteria most implicated in periodontal disease 
and bone loss:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</i> and <i>Porphyromonas 
gingivalis.</i> These two bacteria appear to be particularly likely to cause 
aggressive periodontal disease. Both<em>P. gingivalis</em> and <em>A. 
actinomycetemcomitans</em>, along with multiple deep pockets in the gum, are 
associated with resistance to standard treatments for gum disease.<em>P. 
gingivalis</em> may double the risk for serious gum disease. <em>P. gingivalis
</em> produces enzymes, such as one called arginine-specific cysteine 
proteinase, that may disrupt the immune system and lead to subsequent 
periodontal connective tissue destruction.</li> 
<li><i>Bacteroides forsythus</i> is also strongly linked to periodontal 
disease.</li> 
<li>Other bacteria associated with periodontal disease are <i>Treponema 
denticola, T. socranskii,</i> and <i>P. intermedia</i>. These bacteria, 
together with<i>P. gingivalis</i>, are frequently present at the same sites, 
and are associated with deep periodontal pockets.</li> </ul> 
<p>Some bacteria are related to gingivitis, but not plaque development. They 
include various streptococcal species.</p> 
<h3>The Autoimmune and Inflammatory Response</h3> 
<p>Evidence indicates that periodontal disease is an <i>autoimmune disorder</i>
, in which immune factors in the body attack the person's own cells and tissue 
-- in this case, those in the gum. It appears to work like this:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The bacteria that form plaque and tartar release toxins that stimulate the 
immune system to overproduce powerful infection-fighting factors called<i>
cytokines</i>.</li> 
<li>Ordinarily, cytokines are important for healing. In excess, however, they 
can cause inflammation and severe damage.</li> 
<li>In addition, white blood cells produced by the immune response to bacteria 
also release a family of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which 
break down connective tissue.</li> </ul> 
<p>Studies suggest that this inflammatory response may have damaging effects 
not only in the gums but also in organs throughout the body, including the 
heart.</p> 
<h3>Viral Causes</h3> 
<p>Certain herpes viruses (herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus, the 
cause of chickenpox and shingles) are known causes of gingivitis. Other herpes 
viruses (cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr) may also play a role in the onset or 
progression of some types of periodontal disease, including aggressive and 
severe chronic periodontal disease. All herpes viruses go through an active 
phase followed by a latent phase and possibly reactivation.</p> 
<p>These viruses may cause periodontal disease in different ways, including 
release of tissue-destructive cytokines, overgrowth of periodontal bacteria, 
suppressing immune factors, and initiation of other disease processes that lead 
to cell death.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>More than 75% of American adults have some form of gum disease, but 
according to a major survey, only 60% have any significant knowledge about the 
problem. Gum inflammation and ulcers are common, and not all people with these 
problems develop periodontal disease. Still, about 30% of people are 
genetically susceptible to periodontal disease. Other factors also put 
individuals at higher risk.</p> 
<h3>Oral Environment</h3> 
<p><i>Lack of Oral Hygiene.</i> Lack of oral hygiene encourages bacterial 
buildup and plaque formation.</p> 
<p><i>Sugar and Acid.</i> The bacteria that cause periodontal disease thrive 
in acidic environments. Therefore, eating sugars and other foods that increase 
the acidity in the mouth increase bacterial counts.</p> 
<p><i>Poorly Contoured Restorations.</i> Poorly contoured restorations 
(fillings or crowns) that provide traps for debris and plaque can also 
contribute to its formation.</p> 
<p><i>Anatomical Tooth Abnormalities.</i> Abnormal tooth structure can 
increase the risk.</p> 
<p><em>Wisdom Teeth</em>. Wisdom teeth, also called third molars, can be a 
major breeding ground for the bacteria that cause periodontal disease. In fact, 
for patients in their 20s, periodontal disease is most likely to occur around 
the wisdom teeth. Periodontitis can occur in wisdom teeth that have broken 
through the gum as well as teeth that are impacted (buried). Periodontal 
disease can also be present even in patients with wisdom teeth who do not have 
any symptoms. Adolescents and young adults with wisdom teeth should have a 
dentist check for signs of periodontal disease.</p> 
<h3>Age</h3> 
<p><i>Children and Adolescents.</i> Gingivitis, in varying degrees, is nearly 
a universal finding in children and adolescents. In rare genetic cases, 
children and adolescents are subject to destructive forms of the disease. 
Researchers have also observed some of the organisms seen in periodontal 
disease in young children without signs of gum problems. Healthy children, 
however, do not generally harbor two primary periodontal bacteria,<i>P. 
gingivalis</i> and <i>T. denticola</i>. The disease is also uncommon in 
teenagers.</p> 
<p><i>Adults.</i> As people age, the risk for periodontal disease increases. 
Over half of American adults have gingivitis surrounding 3 - 4 teeth, and 30% 
have significant periodontal disease surrounding 3 - 4 teeth. In a study of 
people over 70 years old, 86% had at least moderate periodontitis, and over a 
quarter of them had lost their teeth.</p> 
<h3>Female Hormones</h3> 
<p>About three-quarters of periodontal office visits are made by women, even 
though women tend to take better care of their teeth than men. Female hormones 
affect the gums, and women are particularly susceptible to periodontal 
problems. Hormone-influenced gingivitis appears in some adolescents, in some 
pregnant women, and is occasionally a side effect of birth control medication.
</p> 
<p><i>Before Menstruation.</i> Gingivitis may flare up in some women a few 
days before they menstruate, when progesterone levels are high. Gum 
inflammation may also occur during ovulation. Progesterone dilates blood 
vessels causing inflammation, and blocks the repair of collagen, the structural 
protein that supports the gums.</p> 
<p><i>Pregnancy.</i> Hormonal changes during pregnancy can aggravate existing 
gingivitis, which typically worsens around the second month and reaches a peak 
in the eighth month. Pregnancy does not cause gum disease, and simple 
preventive oral hygiene can help maintain healthy gums. Any pregnancy-related 
gingivitis usually resolves within a few months of delivery. Because 
periodontal disease can increase the risk for low-weight infants and cause 
other complications, it is important for pregnant women to see a dentist.</p> 
<p><i>Oral Contraceptives.</i> Some studies report that oral contraceptives 
containing the synthetic progesterone desogestrel (but not dienogest, another 
common progesterone) increase the risk for periodontal disease.</p> 
<p><i>Menopause.</i> Estrogen deficiency after menopause reduces bone mineral 
density, which can lead to bone loss. Bone loss is associated with both 
periodontal disease and osteoporosis. Bone loss in the alveolar bone (which 
holds the tooth in place) may be a major predictor of tooth loss in 
postmenopausal women. Periodontal disease is the main cause of alveolar bone 
loss. During menopause, some women may also develop a rare condition called 
menopausal gingivostomatitis, in which the gums are dry, shiny, and bleed 
easily. Women may also experience abnormal tastes and sensations (such as 
salty, spicy, acidic, and burning) in the mouth.</p> 
<h3>Family Factors</h3> 
<p>Periodontal disease often occurs in members of the same family. Genetics, 
intimacy, hygiene, or a mixture of factors may be responsible. Studies have 
found that children of parents with periodontitis are 12 times more likely to 
have the bacteria thought to be responsible for causing plaque and, eventually, 
periodontal disease.</p> 
<p><i>Genetic Factors.</i> Genetic factors may play the critical role in half 
the cases of periodontal disease. Up to 30% of the population may have some 
genetic susceptibility to periodontal disease.</p> 
<p><i>Intimacy.</i> Intimate partners and spouses of people with periodontal 
disease may also be at risk. Researchers have found that the bacteria<i>P. 
gingivalis</i> may be contagious after exposure to an infected person over a 
long period of time. There is no risk from short exposure, such as after a fast 
kiss or when sharing an eating utensil.</p> 
<h3>Smoking and Nicotine</h3> 
<p>Smoking is the single major preventable risk factor for periodontal 
disease. The habit can cause bone loss and gum recession even in the absence of 
periodontal disease. A number of studies indicate that smoking and nicotine 
increase inflammation by reducing oxygen in gum tissue and triggering an 
over-production of immune factors called cytokines (specifically ones called 
interleukins). In excess, cytokines are harmful to cells and tissue.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, when nicotine combines with oral bacteria, such as <em>P. 
gingivalis</em>, the effect produces even greater levels of cytokines and 
eventually leads to periodontal connective tissue breakdown. Smokers may be 
more than 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to harbor the bacteria that 
cause periodontal disease and are also more likely to have advanced periodontal 
disease.</p> 
<p>The risk of periodontal disease increases with the number of cigarettes 
smoked per day. Smoking cigars and pipes carries the same risks as smoking 
cigarettes. Exposure to secondhand smoke may also be associated with an 
increased risk for developing periodontal disease, according to one study. 
Fortunately, when smokers quit, their periodontal health gradually recovers to 
a state comparable to that of nonsmokers.</p> 
<p>Some research also indicates that regular cannabis (marijuana) smoking also 
increases the risk of periodontal disease.</p> 
<h3>Diseases Associated with Periodontal Disease</h3> 
<p><i>Diabetes.</i> Much evidence exists on the link between type 1 and 2 
diabetes and periodontal disease. Diabetes causes changes in blood vessels, and 
high levels of specific inflammatory chemicals such as interleukins, that 
significantly increase the chances of periodontal disease. High levels of 
triglycerides (which are common in type 2 diabetes) also appear to impair 
periodontal health. Obesity, common in people with type 2 diabetes, may also 
predispose a person to gum disease. Controlling both type 1 and 2 diabetes may 
help reduce periodontal problems. For children with diabetes, good oral hygiene 
should begin at a young age.</p> 
<p><i>Osteoporosis and Osteonecrosis.</i> Osteoporosis (loss of bone density) 
has been associated with periodontal disease in postmenopausal women.</p> 
<p>There have been a few reports of osteonecrosis (bone decay) of the jaw in 
patients who take oral bisphosphonate drugs such as alendronate (Fosamax). 
However, almost all cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with 
bisphosphonate drugs occur during or after the use of intravenous 
bisphosphonates, usually given as part of treatment for bone cancer or other 
cancers that have spread to the bone. Symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
include loose teeth, exposed jawbone, pain or swelling in the jaw, gum 
infections, and poor healing of the gums.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>As a precaution, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that 
patients who are prescribed or are to receive bisphosphonate drugs get a 
thorough dental exam before beginning drug therapy, or as soon as possible 
after beginning therapy. The ADA also recommends that patients who take oral 
bisphosphonate drugs should discuss with their dentists any potential risks 
from dental procedures (such as extractions and implants) that involve the 
jawbone. In any case, be sure to inform your dentist if you are taking a 
bisphosphonate drug. Your dentist or oral surgeon may need to take special 
precautions when performing dental surgery.</p> 
<p><i>Herpes-Related Gingivitis.</i> Herpes virus is a common cause of 
gingivitis in children and has become increasingly common in adults. It 
typically starts out with a purplish color and &quot;boggy&quot; sensation in 
the gums. Multiple blisters may form across the mucus membranes in the mouth 
and gums, followed by ulcers. They usually resolve in 7 - 14 days.</p> 
<p><i>HIV-Associated Gingivitis.</i> HIV-associated gingivitis has been 
reported in 15 - 50% of patients with HIV or AIDS. HIV-positive individuals 
harbor larger numbers of periodontal bacteria (candida albicans, P. gingivalis, 
black-pigmented anaerobic rods, and<i>A. actinomycetemcomitans</i>) than people 
without HIV. Severe pain is characteristic, along with odor, spontaneous 
bleeding, ulcers, and swollen, bright red gums. The inflammation never recedes, 
but halitosis and acute episodes can be managed by conventional cleaning 
treatments. Its severest form, known as necrotizing stomatitis, can be 
diagnostic for AIDS. In addition to bleeding, the gums in the front of the 
mouth are a yellowish-gray color, and bone thrusts out.</p> 
<p><i>Autoimmune Diseases.</i> Autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease, 
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, CREST syndrome) 
have been associated with a higher incidence of periodontal disease. Some 
research suggests that periodontal disease may even play some causal role. 
Still, more research is needed to determine a definitive association between 
these diseases.</p> 
<p><i>Other Diseases.</i> People with tuberculosis, syphilis, Wegener's 
granulomatosis, amyloidosis, and many genetic disorders are also at higher risk 
for periodontitis.</p> 
<h3>Vitamin C Deficiencies</h3> 
<p>Vitamin C helps the body repair and maintain connective tissue, and its 
antioxidant effects are important in the presence of tissue-destroying oxidants 
in periodontal disease. Research indicates that vitamin C deficiency 
contributes to periodontal disease. Vitamin C levels are especially depleted in 
smokers. Eating citrus fruits high in vitamin C (such as grapefruit) may be 
helpful for patients with periodontitis.</p> Click the icon to see an image of

<h3>Ethnic, Socioeconomic, and Geographic Factors</h3> 
<p>Dental disease is most likely to affect the poor. Children and the elderly 
suffer the worst oral care, and ethnic minorities follow. In the United States, 
the lack of access to dental insurance is a contributing factor.</p> 
<h3>Drug-Induced Gingivitis</h3> 
<p>Gingival overgrowth can be a side effect of nearly 20 different drugs, most 
commonly phenytoin (Dilantin), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), and a short-acting 
form of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Procardia).</p> 
<h3>Other Causes of Gum Inflammation</h3> 
<p>Several other conditions can also cause gum inflammation, and some have 
been associated with periodontal disease. They include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mouth breathing</li> 
<li>Psychologic stress. Stress can affect the immune system. Some studies 
suggest that stress can influence the development of chronic inflammatory 
diseases, like periodontitis.</li> 
<li>Alcohol abuse. One study reported a higher incidence of periodontal 
disease, tooth decay, and possibly precancerous areas in patients who abuse 
alcohol.</li> 
<li>Canker sores (aphthous ulcers)</li> </ul> Click the icon to see an image 
of a canker sore. <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Self-injury in psychologically disturbed patients</li> 
<li>Hereditary gingival fibromatosis. A rare genetic disease associated with 
both gum overgrowth and hairiness. It is often associated with gingivitis and 
periodontal disease.</li> 
<li>Desquamative gingivitis. With this condition the outer layer of the gum 
tissue desquamates (peels away), exposing an acutely red surface. It usually 
occurs as a result of an allergic reaction or of skin diseases such as lichen 
planus, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, and pemphigus 
vulgaris. This condition generally resolves when the underlying problem is 
treated. It is fairly common in middle-aged women.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Complications 
<p>The ultimate outcome of uncontrolled periodontal disease is tooth loss. As 
the destructive factors cause the breakdown of bone and connective tissue, 
teeth lose their anchor.</p> 
<h3>Bad Breath</h3> 
<p>A much less severe but nevertheless distressing problem caused by 
periodontal disease is bad breath, although coatings on the tongue may 
contribute more to bad breath than periodontal disease.</p> 
<h3>Heart Disease and Stroke</h3> 
<p>Studies have reported that people who have heart disease have a 1.5 - 4 
times increased risk for periodontal disease. (The risk is highest for patients 
with extensive gum disease, bleeding from every tooth.) Acute coronary 
syndrome, high blood pressure (hypertension), and high cholesterol have also 
been associated with periodontal disease.</p> 
<p>Periodontal disease has also been linked to stroke and coronary artery 
disease (CAD). The more severe the periodontitis, the greater the risk for 
heart problems. However, it is still not clear whether periodontal disease is a 
risk factor for stroke or a marker that reflects various risk factors common to 
both conditions.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>An inflammatory response may be the common element. This is an 
over-reaction of the immune system that causes injury to tissues in the body. 
Patients with heart conditions and periodontal disease may have elevated levels 
of C-reactive protein (CRP), which indicates inflammation is present. Some 
research indicates that this inflammatory response can also cause injury in the 
arteries supplying blood to the heart.</p> 
<p>Other evidence suggests that the periodontal disease bacteria themselves -- 
particularly<em>P. gingivalis</em>, <em>T. denticola</em>, <em>T. forsythia</em>
, and<em>streptococci</em> species -- may be associated with thicker carotid 
arteries (a predictor of heart attack and stroke), regardless of C-reactive 
protein levels. It is still not clear if periodontal disease actually causes 
heart disease.</p> 
<p>It is also not clear if treating gum disease can reduce the risks of heart 
disease and improve health outcomes for patients with periodontal disease and 
vascular heart problems. Studies have been mixed, but research is ongoing.</p> 
<h3>Effect on Diabetes</h3> 
<p>Diabetes is not only a risk factor for periodontal disease -- periodontal 
disease itself can worsen diabetes and make it more difficult to control blood 
sugar.</p> 
<h3>Effect on Respiratory Disease</h3> 
<p>Bacteria that reproduce in the mouth can also be carried into the airways 
in the throat and lungs, increasing the risks for respiratory diseases and 
worsening chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema.</p> Click the icon to see 
an image of emphysema. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Effect on Pregnancy</h3> 
<p>Many studies strongly indicate that bacterial infections that cause 
moderate-to-severe periodontal disease in pregnant women can increase the risk 
for premature delivery and low birth weight infants. The more severe the 
infection, the greater the risk to the baby. Research indicates that bacteria 
from gum disease and tooth decay may trigger the same factors in the immune 
system, which can then cause premature dilation and contractions.</p> 
<p>Women should have a periodontal examination before becoming pregnant or as 
soon as possible thereafter. Because women with diabetes are at higher risk for 
periodontal disease, it is especially important that they see a dentist early 
in pregnancy. Doctors are still not sure if treating periodontal disease can 
improve birth outcomes. In any case, periodontal treatment is safe for pregnant 
women.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Prevention 
<p>Healthy habits and good oral hygiene are critical in preventing gum 
disease. Regular and effective tooth brushing and mouth washing, however, are 
effective only above and slightly below the gum line. Once periodontal disease 
develops, more intensive treatments are needed.</p> 
<h3>Dietary Changes</h3> 
<p>It is important to reduce both the quantity and, in particular, the <i>
frequency</i> of sugar intake. Avoid snacks and drinks with sugar (other than 
natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables). Eat sugar-containing foods with 
meals, ideally followed by brushing. Since fruit juices can also cause tooth 
erosion in children, parents should emphasize milk and water.</p> 
<h3>Quitting Smoking</h3> 
<p>Smoking plays a significant role in many cases of chronic periodontal 
disease. For smokers, quitting is one of the most important steps toward 
regaining periodontal health.</p> 
<h3>Fluoride Treatments</h3> 
<p>Fluoride treatment in children has helped to account for the decline in 
periodontal disease in adults. Because fluoride prevents decay, back molars, 
which keep the teeth in place, are spared, and are thus less vulnerable to 
bacteria. Even before teeth first erupt, babies' gums should be wiped clean 
with a bit of gauze bearing a dab of fluoride toothpaste. Supplementation with 
fluoride tablets or drops may be recommended for children 6 months or older who 
drink unfluoridated water or who are at risk for dental problems. A 
prescription from the child's pediatrician or dentist is required.</p> 
<p>Some dentists recommend a fluoride gel for adult patients who are still at 
risk for tooth decay or sensitivity, but extra fluoride is generally not 
necessary for adults who use fluoride toothpaste.</p> 
<h3>Dental Examinations</h3> 
<p>Periodontitis is a silent disease. People with the disease rarely 
experience pain and may not be aware of the problem. A periodontal examination 
by a general dentist once or twice a year should reveal any incipient or 
progressive problems. A full mouth series of x-rays is advised every 2 - 3 
years. This will alert the dentist to early bone loss and other disorders of 
the oral cavity.</p> 
<p>Dentists now often perform Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR) using 
a probe to measure gum pockets. Previously performed only by periodontists, 
this procedure is now encouraged as part of a regular dental examination. The 
dentist will identify any areas where deep pocketing has occurred, where the 
health of the gingiva appears compromised, and where there is undue mobility of 
teeth. It is the general dentist's responsibility to identify periodontal 
disease and inform the patient. If the condition is severe, the dentist may 
want to refer the patient to a periodontist.</p> 
<h3>Daily Dental Care</h3> 
<p>Correct tooth brushing, mouth cleansing, and flossing should be everyone's 
defense against periodontal disease. (However, good hygiene is probably not 
enough to prevent periodontal disease in many people. Regular visits to a 
dentist are extremely important, especially for high-risk individuals.)</p> 
<p><i>Brushing Guidelines.</i> The following are some recommendations for 
brushing:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a soft-bristled brush that fits the size and shape of your mouth. 
Place the brush where the gum meets the tooth, with bristles resting along each 
tooth at a 45-degree angle.</li> 
<li>Place the brush where the gum meets the tooth, with bristles resting along 
each tooth at a 45-degree angle.</li> 
<li>Move the brush back and forth gently. Use short (tooth-wide) strokes.</li> 
<li>Begin by brushing the outer tooth surfaces, followed by the inner tooth 
surfaces, and then the chewing surfaces of the teeth.</li> 
<li>For the inside surfaces of the front teeth, gently use the tip of the 
brush in an up-and-down stroke.</li> 
<li>Brush your tongue to help remove additional bacteria.</li> 
<li>Flossing should finish the process. A mouthwash may also be used.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If brushing after each meal is not possible, rinsing the mouth with water 
after eating can reduce bacteria by 30%.</p> 
<p><i>Toothbrushes.</i> A vast assortment of brushes of varying sizes and 
shapes are available, and each manufacturer makes its claim for the benefits of 
a particular brush. Look for the American Dental Association (ADA) seal on both 
electric and regular brushes.</p> 
<p>In spite of the wide variety of nonelectric toothbrushes, both in shape and 
bristle design, a study of eight brands found no significant differences in 
effectiveness among them.</p> 
<p>Electric toothbrushes, particularly those with a stationary grip and 
revolving tufts of bristles, can be advantageous for some people with physical 
disabilities. Electric toothbrushes with heads that move back and forth up to 
thousands of times a minute remove significantly more plaque than ordinary 
brushes. Even more high-tech brushes are now available that use sound waves to 
remove plaque.</p> 
<p>In general, studies have reported no differences between electric and 
manual toothbrushes in their ability to remove plaque. However, if a regular 
toothbrush works, it isn't necessary to buy an expensive electric one.</p> 
<p>For individuals with average dexterity, a four- or five-rowed, soft, 
nylon-bristled toothbrush is sufficient. The most important factor in buying 
any toothbrush, electric or manual, is to choose one with a soft head. Soft 
bristles get into crevices easier and do not irritate the gums, thereby 
reducing the risk of exposing teeth below the gum line compared to hard brushes.
</p> 
<p>Toothbrushes should be replaced every 1 - 3 months. Not only do they become 
breeding grounds for bacteria, but the worn bristles are less effective at 
removing plaque.</p> 
<p><i>Toothpaste.</i> The objective of a good toothpaste is to reduce the 
development of plaque and eliminate periodontal-causing microorganisms without 
destroying the organisms that are important for a healthy mouth. All brands 
should show ADA approval. Even a good toothpaste, however, cannot be delivered 
past 3 mm below the gum line, where periodontitis develops.</p> 
<p>Toothpastes are a combination of abrasives, binders, colors, detergents, 
flavors, fluoride, humectants, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners. Avoid 
highly abrasive toothpastes, especially for individuals whose gums have receded.
</p> 
<p>Ingredients contained in toothpastes may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fluoride. Most commercial toothpastes contain fluoride, which both 
strengthens tooth enamel against decay and enhances remineralization of the 
enamel. Fluoride also inhibits acid-loving bacteria, especially after eating, 
when the mouth is more acidic. This antibacterial activity may help control 
plaque.</li> 
<li>Triclosan. Triclosan is an anti-bacterial substance that may help reduce 
mild gingivitis.</li> 
<li>Metal salts. Metal salts, such as stannous and zinc, serve mostly as 
anti-bacterial substances in toothpastes. Stannous fluoride gel toothpastes do 
not reduce plaque, however, even though they have some effect against the 
bacteria that cause it, but slightly reduce gingivitis.</li> 
<li>Peroxide and baking soda. Toothpastes with these ingredients claim to have 
a whitening action, but while they may help remove stains there is little 
evidence they whiten the actual color of the teeth. In addition, these 
substances appear to offer no benefits against gum disease.</li> 
<li>Antibacterial sugar substitutes (xylitol), and detergents (delmopinol)</li>
</ul> 
<p><i>Mouthwashes.</i> The American Dental Association recommends (in addition 
to daily brushing and flossing)<em>antimicrobial</em> mouthwash to help prevent 
and reduce plaque and gingivitis, and<em>fluoride</em> mouthwashes to help 
provide additional protection against tooth decay.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chlorhexidine (Peridex or PerioGard) is an antimicrobial mouthwash 
available by prescription only. It reduces plaque by 55% and gingivitis by 30 - 
45%. Patients should rinse for 1 minute twice daily. They should wait at least 
30 minutes (and preferably 2 hours) between brushing and rinsing since 
chlorhexidine can be inactivated by certain compounds in toothpastes. It has a 
bitter taste. It also binds to tannins, which are in tea, coffee, and red wine, 
so it has tendency to stain teeth in people who drink these beverages. Studies 
are mixed as to its effectiveness for preventing or reducing periodontal 
disease.</li> 
<li>Listerine is another antimicrobial mouthwash. It is composed of essential 
oils and is available over the counter. It reduces plaque and gingivitis, when 
used for 30 seconds twice a day. It leaves a burning sensation in the mouth 
that most people better tolerate after a few days of use. The usual regimen is 
to rinse twice a day. (Listerine PocketPaks, which are strips that dissolve on 
the tongue, have no proven effects on plague and gingivitis.)</li> 
<li>Mouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium (Scope, Cepacol) have moderate 
antimicrobial effect on plaque, but only if they are used an hour after 
brushing. None are as effective as Listerine or chlorhexidine, but they may 
still have some value for people who cannot tolerate the other mouthwashes.</li>
<li>Mouthwashes containing stannous fluoride and amine fluoride (Meridol) are 
moderately effective, but are also not as effective as effective as Listerine 
or chlorhexidine.</li> 
<li>Fluoride mouthwashes (Act) are helpful in preventing cavities.</li> 
<li>Mouthwashes that contain alcohol are dangerous for children and should be 
kept away from them.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Flossing.</i> The use of dental floss, either waxed or unwaxed, is 
critical in cleaning between the teeth where the toothbrush bristles cannot 
reach. In spite of this, nearly two-thirds of people do not floss.</p> 
<p>To floss correctly, the following steps may be helpful:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Break off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around the middle 
finger of one hand and the rest around the other middle finger.</li> 
<li>Hold the floss between the thumbs and forefingers and gently guide and rub 
it back and forth between the teeth.</li> 
<li>When it reaches the gum line, the floss should be curved around each tooth 
and slid gently back and forth against the gum.</li> 
<li>Finally, rub gently up and down against the tooth. Repeat with each tooth, 
including the outside of the back teeth.</li> 
<li>If, on repeated flossing attempts, the floss becomes shredded or cannot be 
removed easily from between the teeth, a rough crown or overhanging filling may 
be the cause. In such cases, the restoration should be redone. Such areas 
create spaces for the collection of food debris, plaque, and calculus.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Here are some tips in choosing the right floss or flossing device:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a floss that does not shred or break.</li> 
<li>Avoid a very thin floss, which can cut the gum if brought down with too 
much force or not guided along the side of the tooth.</li> 
<li>A floss threader is an invaluable aid for the person who has bridgework. 
Made of plastic, it looks like a needle with a huge eye, or loop. A piece of 
floss is threaded into the loop, which can then be inserted between the bridge 
and the gum. The floss that is carried through with it can then be used to 
clean underneath the false tooth or teeth and along the sides of the abutting 
teeth.</li> 
<li>Another handy device for cleaning under bridges is a Proxabrush, which is 
an interdental cleaner. This is a tiny narrow brush that can be worked in 
between the natural teeth and around the attached false tooth or teeth.</li> 
<li>Special toothpicks such as Stim-U-Dent may be effective for wide spaces 
between teeth but should never replace flossing. Standard toothpicks should 
never be used for regular hygiene.</li> 
<li>Electronic products, such as water piks, are also helpful. These devices 
are expensive but may improve flossing compliance.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Producing Saliva and Drinking Water.</i> Saliva is important for 
diluting the toxins created by plaque. Drinking at least 7 glasses of water a 
day helps reduce inflammation in the mouth by producing more saliva. Increasing 
water intake is particularly important as one ages, when less saliva is 
produced.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>The dental practitioner typically performs a number of procedures to 
determine a diagnosis of periodontal disease.</p> 
<h3>Medical History</h3> 
<p>The dentist will first take a medical history to reveal any past or present 
periodontal problems, any underlying diseases that might be contributing to the 
problem, and any medications the patient is taking. After noting the general 
state of oral hygiene, the dentist may ask about the quality of home dental 
care.</p> 
<h3>Physical Examination</h3> 
<p><i>Inspection of the Gum Area.</i> The dentist inspects the color and shape 
of gingival tissue on the cheek (buccal) side and the tongue (lingual) side of 
every tooth and compares these qualities to the healthy ideal. Redness, 
puffiness, and bleeding upon probing indicate inflammation. If the gum 
formation between teeth is blunt and not pointed, acute necrotizing periodontal 
disease may be indicated.</p> 
<p><i>Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR).</i> PSR is a painless 
procedure used to measure and determine the severity of periodontal disease:</p>
<ul> 
<li>The dentist uses a mirror and a periodontal probe, a fine instrument 
calibrated in millimeters (mm), which is used to measure pocket depth.</li> 
<li>The probe is held along the length of the tooth with the tip placed in the 
pocket. The tip of the probe will then touch the point where the connective 
tissue attaches to the tooth.</li> 
<li>The dentist will &quot;walk&quot; the probe to six specified points on 
each tooth, three on the buccal (cheek) and three on the lingual (tongue) 
sides. The dentist measures the depth of the probe at each point.</li> 
<li>Pocket depths greater than 3 mm indicate disease.</li> </ul> 
<p>These measurements help determine the condition of the connective tissue 
and amount of gingival overgrowth or recession.</p> 
<p><i>Testing Tooth Movement.</i> Tooth mobility is determined by pushing each 
tooth between two instrument handles and observing any movement. Mobility is a 
strong indicator of bone support loss.</p> 
<p><i>X-rays.</i> X-rays are taken to show any loss of bone structure 
supporting the teeth. Eighteen x-rays make up the full mouth series necessary 
for diagnosis.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Treatment 
<p>Studies support the effectiveness of active treatment combined with a 
strict maintenance program for patients with periodontal disease. In one study, 
for example, people with periodontal disease who were inconsistent in caring 
for their gums after treatment had nearly six times the risk for tooth loss as 
those who were very vigilant.</p> 
<p>Some dentists have reported a success rate of 85% when professional 
treatment and good home maintenance are combined. Treatment helps nonsmokers 
more than smokers, particularly when pockets are deep and persistent. Some 
studies suggest that periodontal treatment in people with type 2 diabetes helps 
improve blood sugar levels. Whether treatment will help reduce other health 
risks, including heart attack and stroke, is unknown.</p> 
<p><i>Treatment Goals.</i> Once periodontal disease has been identified, the 
goals of treatment are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>To arrest and control the progress of the disease</li> 
<li>To leave the periodontal tissues in an easily maintainable state</li> 
<li>If possible, to restore the supporting structures, which include bone, gum 
tissue, and ligaments</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Treatment Phases.</i> To achieve these goals, there are various 
approaches:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Initial cleaning, scaling, and curettage</li> 
<li>Surgery -- if needed for reducing deep pockets that remain underneath the 
gum after extensive cleaning sessions</li> 
<li>Low-dose oral or topical antibiotics</li> 
<li>Maintenance</li> </ul> 
<p>After the active treatment is completed and the mouth is in a relative 
state of health, the patient should have regular cleanings lasting 45 minutes 
to 1 hour, about every 3 months. These may be done by the dental hygienist, the 
periodontist, or the general dentist. The patient may alternate between them. 
Home care, of course, must be continued.</p> 
<p><i>Antibiotics Before Treatment.</i> In cases where the individual has a 
mitral valve prolapse or history of rheumatic heart disease, pretreatment with 
an appropriate antibiotic is required before any dental work, including 
cleaning. This is necessary to prevent the possibility of bacterial 
endocarditis, which can be life threatening.</p> 
<h3>Deep Cleaning: Scaling and Root Planing</h3> 
<p>Scaling, polishing, and sometimes curettage are used to manage periodontal 
disease. They are usually accomplished in a series of three to four visits 
spaced about a week apart. (Patients might ask their dentist about the gas 
nitrous oxide, which is helpful for many patients and may reduce the visits to 
a single one.) The dental hygienist or practitioner generally uses both 
ultrasonic and manual instruments to remove calculus.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Calculus above the gum is easily seen. The dental professional usually 
detects calculus below the gum by careful probing with an instrument.</li> 
<li>The hygienist or dentist may use an ultrasonic instrument for removal of 
the more accessible calculus. This probe-like device vibrates at a frequency 
range higher than is audible to the human ear. Some people with low tolerance 
for the ultrasonic probe may wish to request nitrous oxide.</li> 
<li>A spray of water is used with ultrasound to prevent overheating and to 
flush out the debris that is dislodged.</li> 
<li>The dental professional will scrape the plaque from above and below the 
gum line (called scaling). When the probe contacts the rock-like calculus, 
deposits fracture off the tooth fairly efficiently.</li> 
<li>The hygienist or dentist will then smooth the rough spots on the tooth. 
Smoothing the surface helps remove bacteria that collect there (root planing) 
and also helps the gums reattach.</li> 
<li>Polishing is the finishing procedure. It uses a rubber cup with an 
abrasive paste to remove plaque and stains on the crown portion of the tooth. 
It produces a smooth surface, making it temporarily harder for plaque to adhere.
</li> </ul> 
<p>After the cleaning procedure, the dentist will check the pocket depths 
around the teeth after the cleaning process has been completed. Further 
treatment needs are determined by the results of these initial sessions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If the cleaning processes have reduced inflammation, observation only is 
needed.</li> 
<li>If an abscess is present, surgery may be required.</li> </ul> 
<p>Finally, the dental hygienist or practitioner should offer thorough 
instructions on home care to insure the removal of bacteria on a daily basis. 
This includes proper use of the toothbrush, paste, mouth rinses, floss, floss 
threaders, and proxabrushes. Home care can effectively eliminate the plaque 
above the gums and down to 2 mm below the gums.</p> 
<h3>Gingival Curettage</h3> 
<p>Gingival curettage removes the soft tissue lining of the periodontal 
pockets in order to completely eliminate bacteria and diseased tissue. It may 
be used along with scaling and root planing, but achieves a deeper and more 
complete cleaning. Evidence indicates, however, that it does not contribute any 
additional benefits beyond simple scaling and planing.</p> 
<h3>Surgery (Open Flap Curettage)</h3> 
<p>Surgery allows access for deep cleaning of the root surface, removal of 
diseased tissue, and repositioning and shaping of the bones, gum, and tissues 
supporting the teeth. Surgical procedures vary depending on the individual 
diagnosis and needs of the patient. The basic procedure is known as open flap 
curettage. It involves:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The periodontal surgeon lifts, or flaps, the gums away from the tooth and 
surrounding bone.</li> 
<li>The diseased root surfaces are cleaned and curetted (scraped) to remove 
deposits.</li> 
<li>Gum tissue is replaced into positions to minimize pocket depth.</li> 
<li>The periodontist may also contour the remaining bone and attempt to 
regenerate lost bone and gingival attachment through bone grafts and guided 
tissue regeneration or the use of enamel matrix protein derivatives.</li> </ul> 
<p>There is some debate about whether this procedure is any more effective in 
preventing disease progression than non-surgical therapies, such as low-dose 
doxycycline, short-term antibiotics, or antibiotic gels. Some studies have 
reported that although surgical treatment reduced pocket depth more than 
non-surgical therapies for at least a year after the procedure, benefits from 
surgery do not persist beyond 5 years, except in very deep pockets.</p> 
<p><i>Postsurgery Pain and Discomfort.</i> Post-surgery discomfort is usually 
managed easily with over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen. If 
discomfort is severe, stronger analgesics may be prescribed. Some patients 
experience sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures from exposed roots. These 
problems can be managed with topical fluoride treatments or, in severe cases, 
with dental restoration.</p> 
<h3>Techniques and Materials for Restoring Gum Tissue and Bone</h3> 
<p><i>Guided Tissue Regeneration.</i> A more advanced technique, called guided 
tissue regeneration, is used to stimulate bone and gum tissue growth:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First, the root surfaces and diseased bone are meticulously cleaned out. 
Preventing bacterial contamination is very important. The more residual 
bacteria, the greater the chance that the treatment will fail.</li> 
<li>A specialized piece of fabric is sewn around the tooth to cover the crater 
in the bone left after the cleaning. It is either absorbable or nonabsorbable.
</li> 
<li>The gum is then sewn over the fabric. The fabric prevents the gum tissue 
from growing down into the bone defect and allows the bone and the attachment 
to the root to regenerate.</li> 
<li>After 4 - 6 weeks, the nonabsorbable fabric must be removed using a minor 
surgical procedure. The absorbable membrane may be left in. In general, there 
is little difference in outcome between absorbable and nonabsorbable 
procedures. The absorbable fabric may not be as effective as standard grafts if 
gum tissue is thin, although newer materials may prove to produce better 
results.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Bone Grafting</em>. In some cases of severe bone loss, the surgeon may 
attempt to encourage regrowth and restoration of bone tissue that has been lost 
through the disease process. This involves bone grafting:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The surgeon places bone graft material into the defect.</li> 
<li>The material may be either bone from the same patient or a substance 
called decalcified freeze-dried bone allografts (DFDBA) which is obtained from 
a donor.</li> 
<li>This material then stimulates new bone growth in the area.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Enamel Matrix Protein Derivative.</i> Amelogenin is a derivative of a 
major protein in the structure (the matrix) of enamel that helps stimulate gum 
tissue growth. A gel containing amelogenin (Emdogain) is applied during surgery 
and forms a coat over the roots of the teeth. The gel itself dissolves after 2 
days, leaving the active substance behind. Studies report that it is safe and 
may significantly reduce the effects of periodontal disease.</p> 
<h3>Cosmetic and Gum Grafting Treatments</h3> 
<p>Gum grafting techniques can also be very useful for improving the looks of 
the gum as well as adding support to the teeth. During this procedure, the 
periodontist takes gum tissue from the palate or another donor source to cover 
the exposed root in order to even the gum line and reduce sensitivity. Other 
procedures are available to improve the look of the gums and teeth. The gum 
line can be sculpted to improve uneven or excess gums and to cover exposed 
roots as gums recede.</p> 
<h3>Implants</h3> 
<p>Periodontists report that they are achieving great success with tooth 
implants in patients who have lost teeth due to periodontal disease. The 
average cost for a single implant is high, however, and one implant requires 5 
- 7 months for completion.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Medications 
<p>Antibiotics are often used in combination with surgery, curettage, or alone 
to eliminate or prevent disease-causing bacteria after periodontal procedures. 
They are being investigated in oral forms as well as in topical forms that are 
applied directly to the gum. Increasingly, dental professionals are finding 
that local application of antibiotics is more effective than periodontal 
surgery alone. They may even prove to be an alternative to surgery.</p> 
<h3>Oral Antibiotics at Standard Doses</h3> 
<p>Antibiotics given orally and at standard doses have some limited 
applications for periodontal disease. They are typically given for an acute 
infection. Long-term use of antibiotics is advised for the control of juvenile 
periodontitis, refractory periodontitis, rapidly progressing periodontitis, and 
prepubertal periodontitis. (Long-term use of oral antibiotics is generally not 
advised due to the risks of bacterial resistance.) Specific antibiotics used in 
periodontal disease include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tetracycline antibiotics -- which include tetracycline hydrochloride, 
doxycycline, and minocycline -- are the primary drugs used. They not only have 
anti-bacterial actions but also reduce inflammation and help block collagenase, 
the protein that destroys connective tissue and bone, even in low doses. In 
fact, these two actions seem to contribute most to periodontal protection, 
rather than their antibacterial properties. Short-term use of standard-dose 
doxycycline (a 10-day treatment) is used for treating acute periodontal 
infections and for eliminating inflammation. Topical application and long-term 
use of these antibiotics are showing particular promise.</li> 
<li>Some macrolide antibiotics (roxithromycin) may have actions against 
inflammation and growth involved in periodontal disease.</li> 
<li>Some quinolone antibiotics (moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin) may specifically 
target<i>A. actinomycetemcomitans</i>, an important bacteria in periodontal 
disease.</li> 
<li>Metronidazole (Flagyl) in combination with tetracycline or amoxicillin (a 
penicillin) may be used for severe and chronic periodontal disease.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Direct Delivery of Antibiotics to the Gums</h3> 
<p>Topical application of antibiotics to the gum surface does not affect the 
entire body like oral antibiotics do, and they are preferred whenever possible. 
Studies suggest that, in combination with scaling and planing, any of these 
approaches are very effective for periodontal health.</p> 
<h3>Low-Dose and Chemically Modified Tetracyclines</h3> 
<p><i>Subantimicrobial Dose Doxycycline (Periostat).</i> Subantimicrobial dose 
doxycycline (SDD) is a term used for a treatment that uses very low doses (20 
mg) of doxycycline (Periostat). Although doxycycline is a tetracycline 
antibiotic, the doses used are too low to affect bacteria. However, at these 
dose levels, the drug blocks matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -- enzymes that 
destroy the connective tissues holding the teeth. Periostat is taken twice a 
day for months.</p> 
<p>There is some concern that such long-term use may pose a risk for the 
development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or other, still unknown, adverse 
effects. The doses used in this treatment, however, are too low to have any 
effect on bacteria, so this risk may be very low. In fact, several 12-month 
studies report significant improvements in tooth attachment and pocket depth 
with no increased incidence of side effects. [Taking a common nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug, such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil) along with 
doxycycline, may enhance the effectiveness of this treatment.]</p> 
<p><i>Chemically Modified Tetracyclines.</i> Other tetracyclines are being 
developed that inhibit MMPs but have no antibiotic properties, which would, 
theoretically, avoid possible long-term problems with antibiotic resistance.</p>
<h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3> 
<p>NSAIDs are drugs that block factors that cause inflammation and pain.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Over-the-counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, 
Nuprin, Rufen), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT).</li> 
<li>Prescription NSAIDs include naproxen (Naprosyn, Anaprox), diclofenac 
(Voltaren), tolmetin (Tolectin), ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail), indomethacin 
(Indocin).</li> </ul> 
<p>These drugs are used not only for relieving pain in periodontal disease but 
also for slowing the disease process. NSAIDs block inflammatory enzymes 
triggered by cytokines, which are important immune factors in periodontal 
disease. A number of NSAIDs are being investigated for their benefits in 
reducing gingivitis and slowing progression of periodontal disease. 
Investigators are also studying rinses, creams, and other topical forms of 
NSAIDs. Long-term use of NSAIDs can cause stomach problems, such as ulcers and 
bleeding, and possible heart problems.</p> Back to Top <br>
