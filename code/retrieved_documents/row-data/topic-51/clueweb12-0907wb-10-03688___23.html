<h1>Nonprescription Medicines and Products</h1> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>A nonprescription medicine&mdash;sometimes called an over-the-counter, or 
OTC, medicine&mdash;is any drug that you can buy without a doctor's 
prescription. But don't assume that all nonprescription drugs are safe for you. 
These drugs can interact with other medicines and can sometimes cause serious 
health problems. And if you take more than the normal or recommended amount,
overdose may occur.</p> 
<p>Some medicines should only be used by adults or older children. Be sure to 
read the package instructions carefully, or ask apharmacist before giving any 
product to an infant or young child. If you are pregnant, always check with 
your pharmacist or doctor before using any nonprescription medicine, to make 
sure it is safe to use during pregnancy.</p> 
<p>Carefully read the label of any nonprescription drug you use, especially if 
you also take prescription medicines for other health problems. Ask your 
pharmacist for help in finding a nonprescription drug best suited to your 
needs. Use thesetips on how to avoid common medicine problems. </p> 
<p>Some common nonprescription medicines include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Antacids and acid reducers.</li> 
<li>Bulking agents, laxatives, and stool softeners.</li> 
<li>Antidiarrheals.</li> 
<li>Cold and allergy remedies.</li> 
<li>Pain relievers.</li> </ul> 
<p>These drugs can be very helpful when used properly but can cause serious 
problems if used incorrectly. The following tips will help you use common 
nonprescription drugs wisely and safely. In some cases, you may find that you 
don't need to take them at all.</p> 
<h2>Health Tools&nbsp;</h2> 
<p>Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve 
your health.</p> <br>
<br>
Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions 
that are important to many health problems. <br>
&nbsp; Aspirin: Should I Take 
Daily Aspirin to Prevent a Heart Attack or Stroke? <br>
<br>

<h2>Antacids and Acid Reducers</h2> 
<p>Antacids are taken to relieve heartburn or indigestion caused by excess 
stomach acid. There are several kinds of antacids. Learn what ingredients are 
in each type so that you can avoid any adverse effects.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sodium bicarbonate antacids (such as Alka-Seltzer and Bromo Seltzer) 
contain baking soda. Avoid these antacids if you have high blood pressure or 
are on a salt-restricted diet. Alka-Seltzer contains aspirin, which is linked to
Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness in children.</li> 
<li>Calcium carbonate antacids (such as Tums and Alka-Mints) are sometimes 
used as calcium supplements. These products may cause constipation.</li> 
<li>Aluminum-based antacids (such as Amphojel) are less potent and work more 
slowly than other products do. They may also cause constipation. Some may cause 
calcium loss and should not be taken by women who are past menopause. If you 
have kidney problems, check with your doctor before using aluminum-based 
antacids.</li> 
<li>Magnesium compounds (such as Phillips' Milk of Magnesia) may cause 
diarrhea.</li> 
<li>Aluminum-magnesium antacids are less likely to cause constipation or 
diarrhea than are aluminum-only or magnesium-only antacids. Examples include 
Maalox, Mylanta, and Riopan. Many of these types of antacids contain 
simethicone to help break down gas bubbles in your stomach.</li> 
<li>Antacids with alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) contain a foaming agent that 
floats on top of the stomach contents. This may help keep stomach juices from 
coming in contact with your esophagus.</li> </ul> 
<p>Acid reducers decrease the amount of acid produced by the stomach. They 
help relieve heartburn. There are several types of nonprescription acid 
reducers on the market. Examples include H2 blockers (such as famotidine and 
ranitidine) and proton pump inhibitors (such as lansoprazole and omeprazole). 
Each has slightly different cautions for use. Read and carefully follow the 
instructions included with the package.</p> 
<p><b>Antacid and acid reducer precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Try to eliminate the cause of frequent heartburn instead of taking 
antacids regularly. For more information, see the topicHeartburn.</li> 
<li>Consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking an antacid if you take 
other medicines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption and action of some 
prescription medicines. Also consult your doctor if you have ulcers or kidney 
problems.</li> 
<li>Do not use antacids for more than 2 weeks unless you have talked with your 
doctor about taking them on a long-term basis.</li> 
<li> If you have a problem with the function of your kidneys or liver, you 
should be careful with using antacids. All drugs are broken down and removed 
from the body by the combined action of the liver and kidneys. If your kidneys 
are not working correctly, it is possible that too much of the drug will build 
up in your body.</li> 
<li>If you are on a low-salt diet, talk with your doctor or pharmacist before 
choosing an antacid. Some antacids have a lot of salt (sodium).</li> 
<li>If you are pregnant, antacids are safe to use for heartburn symptoms. But 
do not use antacids that have sodium bicarbonate (such as Alka-Seltzer). They 
can cause fluid buildup. During pregnancy it is okay to use antacids that have 
calcium carbonate (such as Tums).</li> </ul> 
<h2>Bulking Agents, Stool Softeners, and Laxatives</h2> 
<p>There are four types of products used to prevent or treat constipation: 
bulking agents, stool softeners, osmotic laxatives, and stimulant laxatives.</p>
<p><b>Bulking agents</b>, such as bran or psyllium (found in Metamucil, for 
example) ease constipation by increasing the volume of stool and making it 
easier to pass. Regular use of bulking agents is safe and helps make them more 
effective.</p> 
<p><b>Stool softeners</b> (such as Colace and Docusate Calcium) soften the 
stool, making it easier to pass. Stool softeners can be most effective if you 
drink plenty of water throughout the day.</p> 
<p><b>Osmotic laxatives</b>, such as Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, or 
Miralax, and nonabsorbable sugars (such as lactulose or sorbitol), hold fluids 
in the intestine. They also draw fluids into the intestine from other tissue 
and blood vessels. This extra fluid in the intestines makes the stool softer 
and easier to pass. Drink plenty of water when you use this type of laxative.
</p> 
<p><b>Stimulant laxatives</b> (such as Correctol, Ex-Lax, and Senokot) make 
stool move faster through the intestines by irritating the lining of the 
intestines. Regular use of stimulant laxatives is not recommended. Stimulant 
laxatives change the tone and feeling in the large intestine, and you can 
become dependent on using laxatives all the time to have a bowel movement.</p> 
<p>There are many other ways to treat constipation, such as drinking more 
water. For more information, see the topicsConstipation, Age 12 and Older and 
Constipation, Age 11 and Younger.</p> 
<p><b>Precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take any laxative or bulking agent with plenty of water or other liquids.
</li> 
<li>Do not take laxatives regularly. They change the tone and feeling in the 
large intestine. And you can become dependent on using them all the time to 
have a bowel movement. If you need help having regular bowel movements, use a 
bulking agent.</li> 
<li>Regular use of laxatives may change your body's ability to absorb vitamin D
 andcalcium. This can lead to weakened bones. </li> </ul> 
<h2>Antidiarrheals</h2> 
<p>There are two types of antidiarrheal drugs, those that thicken the stool 
and those that slow intestinal spasms.</p> 
<p><b>Thickening</b> mixtures (such as psyllium) absorb water. This helps bulk 
up the stool and make it more firm.</p> 
<p><b>Antispasmodic</b> antidiarrheal products slow the spasms of the 
intestine. Loperamide (theactive ingredient in products such as Imodium A-D and 
Pepto Diarrhea Control) is an example of this type of preparation. Some 
products contain both thickening and antispasmodic ingredients.</p> 
<p><b>Antidiarrheal precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use antidiarrheals if you have diarrhea for longer than 6 hours. Do not 
use these medicines if you have bloody diarrhea, a high fever, or othersigns of 
serious illness.</li> 
<li>Read and follow all label directions. Be sure to take the recommended dose.
</li> 
<li>Long-term use is not recommended. To avoid constipation, stop taking 
antidiarrheal medicines as soon as stools thicken.</li> 
<li>If your child or teen gets chickenpox or flu, do not treat the symptoms 
with over-the-counter medicines that contain bismuth subsalicylate (such as 
Kaopectate and Pepto-Bismol). If your child has taken this kind of medicine and 
he or she has changes in behavior with nausea and vomiting, call your doctor. 
These symptoms could be an early sign ofReye syndrome, a rare but serious 
illness.</li> 
<li>Ask your doctor if your child younger than 12 should take these medicines.
</li> </ul> 
<p>For more information on diarrhea symptoms and treatment, see the topics 
Diarrhea, Age 12 and Older and Diarrhea, Age 11 and Younger. </p> 
<h2>Cold and Allergy Remedies</h2> 
<p>In general, whether you take medicines for your cold or not, you'll get 
better in about a week. Rest and liquids are the best treatment for a cold. 
Antibiotics will not help. But nonprescription medicines help relieve some cold 
symptoms, such as nasal congestion and cough.</p> 
<p>Allergy symptoms, especially runny nose, often respond to antihistamines. 
Antihistamines are also found in many cold medicines, often together with a 
decongestant.</p> 
<p><b>Decongestants</b></p> 
<p>Decongestants make breathing easier by shrinking swollen mucous membranes 
in the nose, allowing air to pass through. They also help relieve runny nose and
postnasal drip, which can cause a sore throat.</p> 
<p>Decongestants can be taken orally or used as nose drops or sprays. Oral 
decongestants (pills) provide longer relief, but they cause more side effects.
</p> 
<p>Sprays and drops provide rapid but temporary relief. Sprays and drops are 
less likely to interact with other drugs than oral decongestants are.Saline 
nose drops are not decongestants but may help keep nasal tissues moist so the 
tissues can filter air.</p> 
<p>Your pharmacist can suggest a medicine for your cold and allergy symptoms.
</p> 
<p><b>Decongestant precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Check the label before you use these medicines. They may not be safe for 
young children.</li> 
<li>If you use these medicines, always follow the directions about how much to 
use based on age and in some cases weight. Not everyone needs the same amount 
of medicine.</li> 
<li>Decongestants can cause problems for people who have certain health 
problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma, diabetes, or an 
overactive thyroid. Decongestants may also interact with some drugs, such as 
certain antidepressants and high blood pressure medicines. Read the package 
carefully or ask your pharmacist or doctor to help you choose the best 
decongestant for you.</li> 
<li>Drink extra fluids when you are taking cold medicines.</li> 
<li>Don't use medicated nasal sprays or drops more than 3 times a day or for 
more than 3 days in a row. Continued use will cause a &quot;rebound effect
&quot; in which your mucous membranes swell up more than before you used the 
spray.</li> 
<li>If you are pregnant, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a 
decongestant.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Cough preparations</b></p> 
<p>Coughing is your body's way of getting foreign substances and mucus out of 
yourrespiratory tract. Sometimes, though, coughs are severe enough to impair 
breathing or prevent rest.</p> 
<p>There are two types of coughs: productive and nonproductive. A productive 
cough produces phlegm or mucus (sputum). It's generally best if you don't try 
to stop (suppress) a productive cough. A nonproductive cough does not produce 
sputum. It is a dry cough.</p> 
<p>Water and other liquids, such as fruit juices, are good cough syrups. They 
help soothe the throat and also moisten and thin mucus so it can be coughed up 
more easily.</p> 
<p>You can make a simple and soothing cough syrup at home by mixing 1 part 
lemon juice with 2 parts honey. Use as often as needed. This can be given to 
children 1 year and older.</p> 
<p>There are two kinds of cough medicines:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Expectorants</b> help thin the mucus and make it easier to cough mucus 
up when you have a productive cough. Look for expectorants containing 
guaifenesin.</li> 
<li><b>Suppressants</b> control or suppress the cough reflex and work best for 
a dry, hacking cough that keeps you awake. Look for suppressant medicines 
containing dextromethorphan. Don't suppress a productive cough too much (unless 
it is keeping you from getting enough rest).</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Cough preparation precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cough preparations can cause problems for people who have certain health 
problems, such as asthma, heart disease, high blood pressure, or an enlarged 
prostate (BPH). Cough preparations may also interact with sedatives, certain 
antidepressants, and other medicines. Read the package carefully, or ask your 
pharmacist or doctor to help you choose.</li> 
<li>Cough suppressants can stifle breathing. Use them with caution if you are 
older than 60 or if you have chronic respiratory problems.</li> 
<li>Be careful with cold medicines. They may not be safe for young children, 
so check the label first. If you do give these medicines to a child, always 
follow the directions about how much to give based on the child&rsquo;s age and 
weight.</li> 
<li>Read the label so you know what the ingredients are. Some cough 
preparations contain a large percentage of alcohol, and others contain codeine. 
There are many choices. Ask your pharmacist to advise you.</li> 
<li>Avoid cold remedies that combine medicines to treat many symptoms.</li> 
<li>Avoid alcohol if you are taking medicine with dextromethorphan in it.</li> 
<li>If you are pregnant, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a 
cough preparation.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Antihistamines</b></p> 
<p>Antihistamines dry up nasal secretions and are commonly used to treat 
allergy symptoms and itching.</p> 
<p>There are two types:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Older, first-generation antihistamines (such as chlorpheniramine and 
diphenhydramine). These may make you sleepy or make it harder for you to 
concentrate. They can also affect your coordination, even when they do not make 
you drowsy.</li> 
<li>Newer, second-generation antihistamines (such as cetirizine and 
loratadine). These have fewer side effects. Many of the newer antihistamines 
cause less drowsiness than older antihistamines or cause no drowsiness at all.
</li> </ul> 
<p>If your runny nose is caused by allergies, an antihistamine may help. For 
cold symptoms, home treatment and perhaps a decongestant will probably be more 
helpful. It is usually best to take only single-ingredient allergy or cold 
preparations, instead of those containing manyactive ingredients.</p> 
<p>Products such as chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) and diphenhydramine 
(Benadryl) are single-ingredient antihistamine products.</p> 
<p>Products such as Coricidin, Dristan, and Triaminic contain both a 
decongestant and an antihistamine.</p> 
<p><b>Antihistamine precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Don't give antihistamines to your child unless you've checked with the 
doctor first.</li> 
<li>Use of antihistamines to treat the stuffiness of a cold will often thicken 
the mucus, making it harder to get rid of.</li> 
<li>Drink extra fluids when taking antihistamines.</li> 
<li>Avoid alcohol when taking antihistamines.</li> 
<li>Antihistamines can cause problems for some people with health problems 
such as asthma, glaucoma, epilepsy, or an enlarged prostate. Antihistamines may 
also interact with certain antidepressants, sedatives, and tranquilizers. Read 
the package carefully or ask your pharmacist or doctor to help you choose one 
that will not cause problems.</li> 
<li>When you take an antihistamine that makes you drowsy, the drowsiness 
usually decreases with continued use. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if the 
medicine still makes you drowsy or if the medicine isn't helping your symptoms 
after 1 week. You may want to try an antihistamine that doesn't cause 
drowsiness.</li> 
<li>If you are pregnant, check with your doctor or pharmacist before using an 
antihistamine.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Pain Relievers</h2> 
<p>There are dozens of pain-relief products. Most contain either aspirin, 
ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. These three drugs, as well as naproxen, relieve 
pain and reduce fever. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen also relieve 
inflammation. They belong to a class of drugs callednonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p> 
<p>When you buy pain relievers, keep in mind that generic products are 
chemically equivalent to more expensive brand-name products, and they usually 
work equally well.</p> 
<h3>Aspirin</h3> 
<p>Aspirin is widely used for relieving pain and reducing fever in adults. It 
also relieves minor itching and reduces swelling and inflammation. Aspirin 
comes as adult-strength (325 mg) or low-dose (81 mg). Although it seems 
familiar and safe, aspirin is a very powerful drug.</p> 
<p><b>Aspirin precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep all aspirin out of children's reach.</li> 
<li>Aspirin increases the risk of Reye syndrome in children. <b>Do not give 
aspirin to anyone younger than 20</b> unless your doctor tells you to do so.
</li> 
<li>Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining, causing bleeding or ulcers. If 
aspirin upsets your stomach, try a coated brand, such as Ecotrin. Talk with 
your doctor orpharmacist to find out what may work best for you.</li> 
<li> Do not take NSAIDs if you have had an allergic reaction to this type of 
medicine in the past.</li> 
<li>Throw aspirin away if it starts to smell like vinegar.</li> 
<li>Because aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding, it is not recommended 
for new injuries. Take other medicines such as ibuprofen or naproxen for the 
first 2 or 3 days after an injury.</li> 
<li>If you take a blood thinner (anticoagulant), such as warfarin, or if you 
have gout, talk to your doctor before you take aspirin.</li> 
<li>High doses may result in aspirin poisoning (salicylism). To help prevent 
taking a high dose, follow what the label says or what your doctor told you. 
Stop taking aspirin and call a doctor if any of these symptoms occur:
<ul> 
<li>Ringing in the ears</li> 
<li>Visual disturbances</li> 
<li>Nausea</li> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Rapid, deep breathing</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>If you are pregnant, check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking a 
pain reliever.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Other aspirin uses</b></p> 
<p>In addition to relieving pain and inflammation, aspirin is effective 
against many other ailments. Because of the danger of side effects and the 
interactions aspirin may have with other medicines, do not try these uses of 
aspirin without a doctor's supervision.</p> 
<p><b>Heart attack and stroke</b>: Aspirin in low but regular doses may help 
prevent heart attacks and strokes in certain people. For more information, see:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Coronary Artery Disease.</li> 
<li>Aspirin: Should I Take Daily Aspirin to Prevent a Heart Attack or Stroke?
</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Migraines</b>: Regular, low-dose aspirin use may reduce the frequency of 
migraine headaches. For more information, see the topicMigraine Headaches.</p> 
<h3>Other pain relievers</h3> 
<p><b>Ibuprofen</b> (the active ingredient in products such as Advil and 
Motrin) and<b>naproxen</b> (in products such as Aleve) are other NSAIDs. Like 
aspirin, these drugs relieve pain and reduce fever and inflammation. Also like 
aspirin, they can cause nausea, stomach irritation, and heartburn.</p> 
<p><b>NSAID precautions (Also see Aspirin precautions)</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not use an NSAID for longer than 10 days without talking to your doctor.
</li> 
<li>Talk to your doctor before taking NSAIDs if you have: 
<ul> 
<li> Ulcers or a history of bleeding in your stomach or intestines.</li> 
<li> Stomach pain, upset stomach, or heartburn that lasts or comes back.</li> 
<li>Anemia.</li> 
<li>Bleeding or easy bruising.</li> 
<li>A habit of drinking more than 3 alcoholic drinks a day. This increases 
your risk of stomach bleeding.</li> 
<li>High blood pressure.</li> 
<li>Kidney, liver, or heart disease.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Talk to your doctor before using NSAIDs if you take: 
<ul> 
<li> Blood thinners, such as warfarin, heparin, or aspirin.</li> 
<li>Medicine to treat mental health problems.</li> 
<li>Medicine to decrease swelling (water pills).</li> 
<li>Medicine for arthritis or diabetes.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Read and follow all the instructions on the medicine bottle and box 
carefully before giving your child ibuprofen. For more information, seeUse of 
Ibuprofen in Young Children.</li> 
<li>Talk to your doctor before you give fever medicine to a baby who is 3 
months of age or younger. This is to make sure a young baby's fever is not a 
sign of a serious illness.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Acetaminophen</b> (the active ingredient in products such as Tylenol) 
reduces fever and relieves pain. It does not have the anti-inflammatory effect 
of NSAIDS, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, but it also does not cause stomach 
upset and other side effects.</p> 
<p><b>Acetaminophen precautions</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>The product's package label will tell you how many milligrams (mg) of 
medicine are in each pill or liquid dose, how much you should take; and how 
often you should take it. Do not exceed the dosage limits, and follow the 
instructions on the package if you have health problems that may make it unsafe 
for you to take the usual dosage of a product.</li> 
<li>Read and carefully follow all the instructions on the medicine bottle and 
box before giving your child acetaminophen. For more information, seeUse of 
Acetaminophen in Young Children.</li> 
<li>Talk to your doctor before you give fever medicine to a baby who is 3 
months of age or younger. This is to make sure a young baby's fever is not a 
sign of a serious illness.</li> 
<li>If you are or could be pregnant, do not take any kind of pain reliever 
unless your doctor has told you to. For more information, seeAcetaminophen Use 
During Pregnancy.</li> </ul>
