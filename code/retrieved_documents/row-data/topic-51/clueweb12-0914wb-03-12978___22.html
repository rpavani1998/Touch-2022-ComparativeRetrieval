<h2>  Boxed Warning </h2> 
<h3>  Cardiovascular Risk </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> NSAIDs1[#footnote-1 1] may cause an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can 
be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with 
cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at 
greater risk. (See WARNINGS.)</li> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated for the 
treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) surgery. (See WARNINGS.)</li> </ul> 
<h3>  Gastrointestinal Risk </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events 
including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, 
which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without 
warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious 
gastrointestinal events. (See WARNINGS.)</li> </ul> 
<dl> 
<dt> [#footnote-reference-1 1] </dt> 
<dd> 1 Throughout this package insert, the term NSAID refers to a non-aspirin 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.</dd> </dl> 
<h2>  Description </h2> 
<p>Each hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet contains: </p> 
<p>hydrocodone bitartrate, USP 7.5 mg </p> 
<p>ibuprofen, USP 200 mg </p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are supplied in a fixed 
combination tablet form for oral administration. Hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets combine the opioid analgesic agent, hydrocodone bitartrate, 
with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) agent, ibuprofen.</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate is a semisynthetic and centrally acting opioid 
analgesic. Its chemical name is: 4,5 
&alpha;-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one tartrate (1:1) hydrate (2:5). 
Its structural formula is:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>C18H21NO3&bull;C4H6O6&bull;2&frac12; H2O M.W. 494.50 </p> 
<p>Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent [non-selective COX 
inhibitor] with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its chemical name is: 
(&plusmn;)-2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid. Its structural formula is:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>C13H18O2 M.W. 206.29 </p> 
<p>Inactive ingredients in hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets 
include: colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, hypromellose, lactose 
monohydrate, pregelatinized starch, polyethylene glycol, stearic acid, titanium 
dioxide, and triacetin.</p> 
<h2>  Clinical Pharmacology </h2> 
<h3>  Hydrocodone Component </h3> 
<p>Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive with 
multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these 
involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of 
action of hydrocodone and other opioids is not known, although it is believed 
to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. 
In addition to analgesia, opioids may produce drowsiness, changes in mood, and 
mental clouding.</p> 
<h3>  Ibuprofen Component </h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that possesses 
analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode action, like that of other 
NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of 
cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a 
peripherally acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on 
opiate receptors.</p> 
<h3>  Pharmacokinetics </h3> 
<h4>  Absorption </h4> 
<p>After oral dosing with the hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet, a 
peak hydrocodone plasma level of 27 ng/mL is achieved at 1.7 hours, and a peak 
ibuprofen plasma level of 30 mcg/mL is achieved at 1.8 hours. The effect of 
food on the absorption of either component from the hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablet has not been established.</p> 
<h4>  Distribution </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen is highly protein-bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agents. Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone 
in human plasma has not been definitely determined, structural similarities to 
related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein 
bound. As most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids 
bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% 
[oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range.</p> 
<h4>  Metabolism </h4> 
<p>Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including 
O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 
6-&alpha; and 6-&beta;-hydroxy metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is 
formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and contributes to the total 
analgesic effect of hydrocodone. The O- and N-demethylation processes are 
mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen is present in this product as a racemate, and following 
absorption it undergoes interconversion in the plasma from the R-isomer to the 
S-isomer. Both the R- and S-isomers are metabolized to two primary metabolites: 
(+)-2-4&rsquo;-(2hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic acid and 
(+)-2-4&rsquo;-(2carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of which circulate 
in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.</p> 
<h4>  Elimination </h4> 
<p>Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, 
with a mean plasma half-life of 4.5 hours. Ibuprofen is excreted in the urine, 
50% to 60% as metabolites and approximately 15% as unchanged drug and 
conjugate. The plasma half-life is 2.2 hours.</p> 
<h4>  Special Populations </h4> 
<p>No significant pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender have been 
demonstrated. The pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and ibuprofen from 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets has not been evaluated in children.
</p> 
<h4>  Renal Impairment </h4> 
<p>The effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of the 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen dosage form has not been determined.</p> 
<h2>  Clinical Studies </h2> 
<p>In single-dose studies of post surgical pain (abdominal, gynecological, 
orthopedic), 940 patients were studied at doses of one or two tablets. 
Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets produced greater efficacy than 
placebo and each of its individual components given at the same dose. No 
advantage was demonstrated for the two-tablet dose.</p> 
<h2>  Indications And Usage </h2> 
<p>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to 
use hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. Use the lowest effective dose 
for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals 
(see WARNINGS).</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are indicated for the 
short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain. Hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are not indicated for the treatment of such 
conditions as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<h2>  Contraindications </h2> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in 
patients with known hypersensitivity to hydrocodone or ibuprofen. Patients 
known to be hypersensitive to other opioids may exhibit cross-sensitivity to 
hydrocodone.</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should not be given to 
patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions 
after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like 
reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS, 
Anaphylactoid Reactions and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma).</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated for the 
treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS).</p> 
<h2>  Warnings </h2> 
<h3>  Cardiovascular Effects </h3> 
<h4>  Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events </h4> 
<p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 
three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular 
(CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. 
All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. 
Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater 
risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients 
treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV 
events and the steps to take if they occur.</p> 
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates 
the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. 
The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and 
Perforation).</p> 
<p>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
</p> 
<h3>  Hypertension </h3> 
<p>NSAID-containing products, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting 
hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV 
events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response 
to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAID-containing products, including 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, should be used with caution in 
patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely 
during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.
</p> 
<h3>  Congestive Heart Failure and Edema </h3> 
<p>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking 
NSAIDs. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should be used with 
caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.</p> 
<h3>  Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids </h3> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets contain hydrocodone, an opioid 
agonist, and are a Schedule III controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the 
potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction 
disorders, and are subject to diversion.</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets can be abused in a manner 
similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered 
when prescribing or dispensing hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in 
situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased 
risk of misuse, abuse or diversion (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).</p> 
<h3>  Respiratory Depression </h3> 
<p>At high doses or in opioid-sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce 
dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem 
respiratory centers. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls 
respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.</p> 
<h3>  Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure </h3> 
<p>The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate 
cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of 
head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial 
pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions which may obscure the 
clinical course of patients with head injuries.</p> 
<h3>  Acute Abdominal Conditions </h3> 
<p>The administration of opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course 
of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p> 
<h3>  Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and 
Perforation</h3> 
<p>NSAIDs, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, can cause 
serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large 
intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any 
time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 
one in five patients who develops a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID 
therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused 
by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and 
in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with 
longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI 
event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term 
therapy is not without risk.</p> 
<p>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior 
history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs 
have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared 
to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the 
risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of 
oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, 
smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most 
spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients 
and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p> 
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p> 
<h3>  Renal Effects </h3> 
<p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis 
and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom 
renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal 
perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin 
formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt 
renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with 
impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy 
is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p> 
<h3>  Advanced Renal Disease </h3> 
<p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the 
use of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced 
renal disease. Therefore, treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close 
monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</p> 
<h3>  Anaphylactoid Reactions </h3> 
<p>As with other NSAID-containing products, anaphylactoid reactions may occur 
in patients without known prior exposure to hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should not be 
given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs 
in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or 
who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or 
other NSAIDs. Fatal reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients 
(see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma). Emergency help 
should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</p> 
<h3>  Skin Reactions </h3> 
<p>Products containing NSAIDs, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can 
be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be 
informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of 
the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any 
other sign of hypersensitivity.</p> 
<h3>  Pregnancy </h3> 
<p>As with other NSAID-containing products, hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets should be avoided in late pregnancy because they may cause 
premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p> 
<h2>  Precautions </h2> 
<h3>  General </h3> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets cannot be expected to 
substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt 
discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients 
on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if 
a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p> 
<p>The pharmacological activity of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these 
diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful 
conditions.</p> 
<h3>  Special Risk Patients </h3> 
<p>As with any opioid analgesic agent, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and 
those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, 
Addison&rsquo;s disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. The usual 
precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression 
should be kept in mind.</p> 
<h3>  Cough Reflex </h3> 
<p>Hydrocodone suppresses the cough reflex; as with opioids, caution should be 
exercised when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are used 
postoperatively and in patients with pulmonary disease.</p> 
<h3>  Hepatic Effects </h3> 
<p>Borderline elevations of one or more liver enzymes may occur in up to 15% 
of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen as found in hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, 
may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable 
elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) (approximately three or more times the 
upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in 
clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic 
reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and 
hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p> 
<p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in 
whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of 
the development of more severe hepatic reactions while on hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets 
should be discontinued.</p> 
<h3>  Hematological Effects </h3> 
<p>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen 
as found in hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. This may be due to 
fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described 
effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs 
including ibuprofen, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they 
exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</p> 
<p>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets who may be adversely affected by 
alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or 
patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</p> 
<h3>  Preexisting Asthma </h3> 
<p>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin 
in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe 
bronchospasm, which may be fatal. Since cross-reactivity between aspirin and 
other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should not be administered to patients with 
this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients 
with preexisting asthma.</p> 
<h3>  Aseptic Meningitis </h3> 
<p>Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rare occasions 
in patients on ibuprofen therapy as found in hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it 
has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If 
signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on hydrocodone bitartrate 
and ibuprofen tablets, the possibility of its being related to ibuprofen should 
be considered.</p> 
<h3>  Information for Patients </h3> 
<p>Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating 
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. 
Patients should also be encouraged to read the hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablet Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, 7.5 mg/200 mg, like other 
opioid-containing analgesics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a 
car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly.</li> 
<li> Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, 
when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.</li> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets can be abused in a manner 
similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for 
as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently 
than prescribed.</li> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAID-containing 
products, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may 
result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur 
without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms 
of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should 
ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients 
should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, 
Cardiovascular Effects).</li> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAID-containing 
products, can cause GI discomfort and serious GI side effects, such as ulcers 
and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although 
serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, 
patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and 
bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign 
or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. 
Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and 
Perforation).</li> 
<li> Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAID-containing 
products, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, 
SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although 
serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for 
the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of 
hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when 
observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop 
the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their 
physicians as soon as possible.</li> 
<li> Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight 
gain or edema to their physicians.</li> 
<li> Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right 
upper quadrant tenderness, and &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms). If these occur, 
patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical 
therapy.</li> 
<li> Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction 
(e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, 
patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
</li> 
<li> In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets should be avoided because they may cause premature closure of 
the ductus arteriosus.</li> 
<li> Patients should be instructed to report any signs of blurred vision or 
other eye symptoms.</li> </ol> 
<h3>  Laboratory Tests </h3> 
<p>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning 
symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. 
Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a 
chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should be discontinued.</p> 
<h3>  Drug Interactions </h3> 
<h4>  ACE-inhibitors </h4> 
<p>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of 
ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients 
taking hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets concomitantly with 
ACE-inhibitors.</p> 
<h4>  Anticholinergics </h4> 
<p>The concurrent use of anticholinergics with hydrocodone preparations may 
produce paralytic ileus.</p> 
<h4>  Antidepressants </h4> 
<p>The use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic 
antidepressants with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets may increase 
the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.</p> 
<p>MAOIs have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid 
drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant depression of respiration or 
coma. The use of hydrocodone is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or 
within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p> 
<h4>  Aspirin </h4> 
<p>When hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are administered with 
aspirin, the protein binding of aspirin is reduced, although the clearance of 
free hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen is not altered. The clinical 
significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other 
NSAID-containing products, concomitant administration of hydrocodone bitartrate 
and ibuprofen tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the 
potential of increased adverse effects.</p> 
<h4>  CNS Depressants </h4> 
<p>Patients receiving other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, 
antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly 
with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets may exhibit an additive CNS 
depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both 
agents should be reduced.</p> 
<h4>  Diuretics </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and 
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, the patient should be observed closely for 
signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as diuretic 
efficacy.</p> 
<h4>  Lithium </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen has been shown to elevate plasma lithium concentration and reduce 
renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% 
and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has 
been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. 
Thus, when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and lithium are 
administered concurrently, patients should be observed for signs of lithium 
toxicity.</p> 
<h4>  Methotrexate </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen, as well as other NSAIDs, has been reported to competitively 
inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate 
that ibuprofen could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be 
used when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate.</p> 
<h4>  Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics </h4> 
<p>Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol 
and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to patients who have 
received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist 
analgesic such as hydrocodone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist 
analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of hydrocodone and/or may 
precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.</p> 
<h4>  Neuromuscular Blocking Agents </h4> 
<p>Hydrocodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the 
neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an 
increased degree of respiratory depression.</p> 
<h4>  Warfarin </h4> 
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such 
that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher 
than users of either drug alone.</p> 
<h3>  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility </h3> 
<p>The carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen has not been investigated. The ability of hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen to impair fertility has not been assessed.</p> 
<h3>  Pregnancy </h3> 
<h4>  Teratogenic Effects </h4> 
<h5>  Pregnancy category C </h5> 
<p>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated 
evidence of developmental abnormalities.</p> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, administered to rabbits at 95 mg/kg 
(5.72 and 1.9 times the maximum clinical dose based on body weight and surface 
area, respectively), a maternally toxic dose, resulted in an increase in the 
percentage of litters and fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in 
the number of litters and fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals (a 
minor abnormality). Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, administered to rats 
at 166 mg/kg (10.0 and 1.66 times the maximum clinical dose based on body 
weight and surface area, respectively), a maternally toxic dose, did not result 
in any reproductive toxicity. However, animal reproduction studies are not 
always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled 
studies in pregnant women. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should 
be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential 
risk to the fetus.</p> 
<h4>  Nonteratogenic Effects </h4> 
<p>Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 
the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during 
pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Babies born to 
mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be 
physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive 
crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased 
stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome 
does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. 
There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal.</p> 
<h3>  Labor and Delivery </h3> 
<p>As with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased 
incidence of dystocia and delayed parturition occurred in rats. Administration 
of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets is not recommended during labor 
and delivery. The effects of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets on 
labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</p> 
<h3>  Nursing Mothers </h3> 
<p>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. In limited 
studies, an assay capable of detecting 1 mcg/mL did not demonstrate ibuprofen 
in the milk of lactating mothers. However, because of the limited nature of the 
studies, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing 
infants from hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, a decision should be 
made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p> 
<h3>  Pediatric Use </h3> 
<p>The safety and effectiveness of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen in 
pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.</p> 
<h3>  Geriatric Use </h3> 
<p>In controlled clinical trials there was no difference in tolerability 
between patients &lt; 65 years of age and those &ge; 65, apart from an 
increased tendency of the elderly to develop constipation. However, because the 
elderly may be more sensitive to the renal and gastrointestinal effects of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as well as possible increased risk of 
respiratory depression with opioids, extra caution and reduced dosages should 
be used when treating the elderly with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen 
tablets.</p> 
<h2>  Adverse Reactions </h2> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets were administered to 
approximately 300 pain patients in a safety study that employed dosages and a 
duration of treatment sufficient to encompass the recommended usage (see DOSAGE 
AND ADMINISTRATION). Adverse event rates generally increased with increasing 
daily dose. The event rates reported below are from approximately 150 patients 
who were in a group that received one tablet of hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen an average of three to four times daily. The overall incidence rates 
of adverse experiences in the trials were fairly similar for this patient group 
and those who received the comparison treatment, acetaminophen 600 mg with 
codeine 60 mg.</p> 
<p>The following lists adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1% or 
greater in clinical trials of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, 
without regard to the causal relationship of the events to the drug. To

<h2>  Drug Abuse And Dependence </h2> 
<h3>  Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids </h3> 
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets contain hydrocodone, an opioid 
agonist, and are a Schedule III controlled substance. Hydrocodone bitartrate 
and ibuprofen tablets, and other opioids used in analgesia can be abused and 
are subject to criminal diversion.</p> 
<p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, 
psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and 
manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of 
the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use 
despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease utilizing a 
multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Drug seeking&rdquo; behavior is very common in addicts and drug 
abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of 
office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, 
repeated &ldquo;loss&rdquo; of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and 
reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other 
treating physician(s). &ldquo;Doctor shopping&rdquo; to obtain additional 
prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated 
addiction.</p> 
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and 
tolerance. Physical dependence usually assumes clinically significant 
dimensions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild 
degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy. 
Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce 
the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially by a shortened duration 
of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of 
analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. 
Physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of 
true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often 
in combination with other psychoactive substances. Hydrocodone bitartrate and 
ibuprofen tablets, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. 
Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and 
renewal requests is strongly advised.</p> 
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic 
re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate 
measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p> 
<h2>  Overdosage </h2> 
<p>Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from hydrocodone and/or 
ibuprofen.</p> 
<h3>  Signs and Symptoms </h3> 
<h4>  Hydrocodone Component </h4> 
<p>Serious overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory 
depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes 
respiration, cyanosis) extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, 
skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia and 
hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest 
and death may occur.</p> 
<h4>  Ibuprofen Component </h4> 
<p>Symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation with erosion and hemorrhage or 
perforation, kidney damage, liver damage, heart damage, hemolytic anemia, 
agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and meningitis. Other 
symptoms may include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, blurred vision, 
mental disturbances, skin rash, stomatitis, edema, reduced retinal sensitivity, 
corneal deposits, and hyperkalemia.</p> 
<h3>  Treatment </h3> 
<p>Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate 
respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution 
of assisted or controlled ventilation. Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can 
reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose or 
unusual sensitivity to opioids, including hydrocodone. Therefore, an 
appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously 
with simultaneous efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of 
action of hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be 
kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should 
be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Supportive measures 
should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing 
unabsorbed drug. In cases where consciousness is impaired it may be inadvisable 
to perform gastric lavage. If gastric lavage is performed, little drug will 
likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Ibuprofen 
is acidic and is excreted in the urine; therefore, it may be beneficial to 
administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures the 
use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and 
reabsorption of ibuprofen. Dialysis is not likely to be effective for removal 
of ibuprofen because it is very highly bound to plasma proteins.</p> 
<h2>  Dosage And Administration </h2> 
<p>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of hydrocodone 
bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to 
use hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. Use the lowest effective dose 
for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals 
(see WARNINGS).</p> 
<p>After observing the response to initial therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate 
and ibuprofen tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an 
individual patient's needs.</p> 
<p>For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain, 
the recommended dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen is one tablet 
every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary. Dosage should not exceed 5 tablets in a 24 
hour period. It should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can 
develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose 
related.</p> 
<p>The lowest effective dose or the longest dosing interval should be sought 
for each patient (see WARNINGS), especially in the elderly. After observing the 
initial response to therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, 
the dose and frequency of dosing should be adjusted to suit the individual 
patient&rsquo;s need, without exceeding the total daily dose recommended.</p> 
<h2>  How Supplied </h2>

<h2>  Medication Guide For Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (Nsaids) </h2>
<p>(See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of prescription NSAID 
medicines.)</p> 
<p>What is the most important information I should know about medicines called 
Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?</p> 
<p>NSAID medicines may increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke that 
can lead to death. This chance increases:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> with longer use of NSAID medicines </li> 
<li> in people who have heart disease </li> </ul> 
<p>NSAID medicines should never be used right before or after a heart surgery 
called a &ldquo;coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).&rdquo;</p> 
<p>NSAID medicines can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines 
at any time during treatment. Ulcers and bleeding:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> can happen without warning symptoms </li> 
<li> may cause death </li> </ul> 
<p>The chance of a person getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> taking medicines called &ldquo;corticosteroids&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;anticoagulants&rdquo;</li> 
<li> longer use </li> 
<li> smoking </li> 
<li> drinking alcohol </li> 
<li> older age </li> 
<li> having poor health </li> </ul> 
<p>NSAID medicines should only be used: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> exactly as prescribed </li> 
<li> at the lowest dose possible for your treatment </li> 
<li> for the shortest time needed </li> </ul> 
<p>What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? </p> 
<p>NSAID medicines are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat 
(inflammation) from medical conditions such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> different types of arthritis </li> 
<li> menstrual cramps and other types of short-term pain </li> </ul> 
<p>Who should not take a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)? </p> 
<p>Do not take an NSAID medicine: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> if you had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with 
aspirin or any other NSAID medicine</li> 
<li> for pain right before or after heart bypass surgery </li> </ul> 
<p>Tell your healthcare provider: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> about all of your medical conditions. </li> 
<li> about all of the medicines you take. NSAIDs and some other medicines can 
interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Keep a list of your 
medicines to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist.</li> 
<li> if you are pregnant. NSAID medicines should not be used by pregnant women 
late in their pregnancy.</li> 
<li> if you are breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor. </li> </ul>
