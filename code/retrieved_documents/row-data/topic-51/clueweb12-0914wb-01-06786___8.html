<h2>Ibuprofen</h2> 
<h3>What can ibuprofen be used for? </h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen can be used for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>mild to moderate pain (such as toothache, migraine and period pain), </li> 
<li>pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid disease and musculoskeletal 
disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis),</li> 
<li>High temperature (fever), and </li> 
<li>sprains and strains.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Use in children</h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen may be given to children from 3 months of age who weigh at least 
5kg to relieve pain, inflammation and high temperature.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, a doctor may advise paracetamol for a younger child. Ibuprofen 
may be advised for babies 2-3 months old to control a high temperature 
following childhood immunisations if paracetamol is unsuitable.</p> 
<p>An injection of ibuprofen may be given to premature babies to treat a 
patent ductus arteriosus (when a blood vessel in the heart does not close 
normally after birth).</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen may also be given to children with rheumatic conditions, such as 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</p> 
<h3>How does ibuprofen work? </h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen is from a group of medicines called non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p> 
<p>It blocks the production of chemicals called prostaglandins. These are 
released in your body in response to illness and injury. They cause pain and 
inflammation (swelling). Prostaglandins released in your brain can cause high 
temperature (fever).</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen begins to ease pain and lower fever about 20-30 minutes after a 
dose is taken. It usually lasts for about 4-6 hours.</p> 
<p>For the anti-inflammatory effect, ibuprofen should be taken regularly and 
it may take up to 2-3 weeks to get the best results.</p> 
<h3>When shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;you take ibuprofen? </h3> 
<p>You should not take ibuprofen if you have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>an allergy to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID),</li> 
<li>a peptic ulcer (ulcer anywhere in the digestive system and stomach, for 
example a duodenal ulcer or gastric ulcer),</li> 
<li>asthma that gets worse when you take aspirin, ibuprofen or other 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),</li> 
<li>severe heart failure, or </li> 
<li>you are taking another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such 
as aspirin, diclofenac, indometacin, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, naproxen, or 
piroxicam.</li> </ul> 
<p>You should use ibuprofen with caution if you have: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma - ibuprofen worsens asthma in about 10% of people with asthma. You 
may take ibuprofen if you know that it doesn&rsquo;t affect your astma. 
However, if you are unsure then only try ibuprofen for the first time when your 
asthma is well controlled.</li> 
<li>High blood pressure (hypertension) &ndash; only take ibuprofen if your 
blood pressure is well controlled.</li> 
<li>Kidney problems &ndash; only take ibuprofen if advised by your doctor. 
</li> 
<li>Had a peptic ulcer or bleeding in the stomach in the past &ndash; only 
take ibuprofen if advised by your doctor.</li> 
<li>You are more than 75 years old &ndash; as there is a greater risk of 
ibuprofen causing a peptic ulcer or serious bleed in your stomach.</li> </ul> 
<p>Also, you should not take ibuprofen without first speaking to your doctor 
if you are taking any of the following medicines:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>ciclosporin, </li> 
<li>lithium, </li> 
<li>methotrexate, </li> 
<li>tacrolimus, or </li> 
<li>warfarin.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Can ibuprofen be taken if you are pregnant or breastfeeding? </h3> 
<h4>Pregnancy </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen may be taken during the 2nd trimester (weeks 14 - 27). However, 
you should avoid taking ibuprofen during the 1st or 3rd trimesters unless 
advised to by your doctor.</p> 
<p>As with any medicine in pregnancy, it should be taken at the lowest 
effective dose for the shortest possible time.</p> 
<h4>Breastfeeding </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen may be taken if you are breastfeeding. It appears in breast milk 
in very small amounts which are unlikely to cause harm to your baby.<br>
<br>

As with any medicine when breastfeeding, it should be taken at the lowest 
effective dose for the shortest possible time.</p> 
<h3>What are the possible side effects?</h3> 
<p>Common side effects include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>nausea (feeling sick), </li> 
<li>vomiting, </li> 
<li>diarrhoea, </li> 
<li>dyspepsia (indigestion), and </li> 
<li>pains in the abdomen (stomach/intestines). </li> </ul> 
<p>Less common side effects include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>allergic reactions (such as a rash), </li> 
<li>dizziness, </li> 
<li>duodenal or gastric ulcers (ulcer in the digestive tract), </li> 
<li>fluid retention, </li> 
<li>gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), </li> 
<li>haematemesis (vomiting blood, which may indicate there is bleeding in the 
stomach),</li> 
<li>malaena (black stools, which may indicate that there is bleeding in the 
stomach or digestive tract),</li> 
<li>raised blood pressure, and </li> 
<li>worsening of asthma by causing bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways).
</li> </ul> 
<p>There is a small increase in the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction 
(heart attack) when ibuprofen is taken at high doses over long periods of time.
</p> 
<p>Long term use of ibuprofen in females may cause reduced fertility. This is 
usually reversible on stopping ibuprofen.</p> 
<h3>Does ibuprofen affect your ability to drive? </h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen is unlikely to affect your ability to drive. However, some people 
may sometimes feel dizzy when taking ibuprofen and you should not drive if you 
experience this.</p> 
<h3>Is ibuprofen safe to take with other medicines? </h3> 
<p>When two or more medicines are taken at the same time, the effects of the 
medicines are sometimes different to when they are taken separately. This is 
known as an interaction.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen can sometimes affect other medicines. The more common and 
significant interactions are listed below. These also apply to ibuprofen 
products applied onto the skin, such as gels, sprays and mousses.</p> 
<p>However, this is not a complete list. If you want to check that your 
medicines are safe to take with ibuprofen, you should ask your doctor or 
pharmacist (chemist) or read the patient information leaflet that comes with 
your medicine.</p> 
<h4>Anti-inflammatory painkillers and aspirin </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen should not be taken with other anti-inflammatory painkillers, 
such as aspirin, diclofenac, indometacin, naproxen, piroxicam. This will 
increase the risk of an ulcer or a serious bleed in the stomach or digestive 
tract.<br>
If you are taking low dose aspirin for its antiplatelet (blood 
thinning) effect, ibuprofen may reduce the blood thinning effect of the aspirin.
</p> 
<h4>Digoxin </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen may cause an increase in the blood levels of digoxin. This can 
result in increased side effects from digoxin.</p> 
<h4>Lithium </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen reduces the body's ability to remove lithium. This can cause 
lithium levels to build up in the body and may result in lithium poisoning.</p> 
<h4>Medicines for high blood pressure </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen can cause an increase in blood pressure. Taking ibuprofen may 
reduce the benefits of taking medicines to lower blood pressure.</p> 
<h4>Methotrexate </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen can reduce the body's ability to remove methotrexate. This can 
cause methotrexate levels to build up in the body and may result in 
methotrexate poisoning.</p> 
<h4>Tacrolimus </h4> 
<p>Ibuprofen taken with tacrolimus increases the risk of kidney damage.</p> 
<h4>SSRI antidepressants </h4> 
<p>SSRI antidepressants include citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and 
sertraline. Ibuprofen increases the risk of bleeding in people taking SSRI 
antidepressants.</p> 
<h4>Warfarin </h4> 
<p>Warfarin is an anticoagulant medicine that stops the blood from clotting. 
Ibuprofen may increase the anticoagulant (blood clotting) effect of warfarin 
which could result in bruising or more serious bleeding, such as blood in the 
urine or stools.</p> 
<h3>Can&nbsp;you drink alcohol? </h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen may be taken with small amounts of alcohol. However, heavy 
alcohol drinkers who take ibuprofen have an increased risk of bleeding in the 
stomach.</p> 
<h3>Are there any interactions with food? </h3> 
<p>There are no known interactions with food. However, it is best to take 
ibuprofen with or after food to reduce any irritation to the stomach.</p> 
<h3>What if&nbsp;you forget to take a dose? </h3> 
<p>If you forget to take your dose of ibuprofen, the general advice is:</p> 
<p> <strong>If the dose is less than 2 hours late</strong> - Take the dose as 
soon as you remember and then take the next dose as normal.</p> 
<p> <strong>If the dose is more than 2 hours late</strong> - Skip the missed 
dose, wait until the next dose is due, and then continue as normal.</p> 
<p>Check the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with your medicine as this 
should give you advice about what to do.</p> 
<h3>What if&nbsp;you accidentally take an extra dose? </h3> 
<p> <strong>If you accidentally take an extra dose of ibuprofen</strong> - 
Omit the next dose so that you are not taking more than your recommended number 
of tablets in 24 hours and then carry on as normal. If you feel unwell or are 
concerned, Call NHS Direct on 0845 4647 or contact your GP.</p> 
<p> <strong>If you have taken more than the recommended total daily dose of 
ibuprofen</strong> - Seek advice immediately. Call NHS Direct on 0845 4647, 
contact your GP or go to yournearest Accident and Emergency department (A&amp;E)
