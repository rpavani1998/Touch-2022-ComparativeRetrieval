<p>Fever, also known as pyrexia, is any body temperature that is elevated 
above the normal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Body temperature 
fluctuates throughout the day, and can elevate due to normal everyday 
activities, such as exercise. However, an elevated temperature of 100.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit or higher is considered medically significant, and is usually due to 
an underlying medical condition.</p> 
<h2>How to Diagnose a Fever</h2> 
<p>If the body temperature is higher than the normal temperature of 98.6F, and 
cannot be explained by activity level,a fever is present. Diagnosing this is a 
simple matter of taking one&rsquo;s temperature with a thermometer. Sometimes, 
depending on signs and symptoms accompanying the fever, a physical exam or 
other tests will be ran in order to determine if the cause of the fever is 
infection or something else. Once a determination of the underlying medical 
condition has been made, other tests (such as a blood test) may be required to 
confirm the diagnosis.<br>
</p> 
<h2>How to Determine Body Temperature</h2> 
<p>A thermometer is used to measure body temperature. The three most common 
methods are rectal; oral; tympanic (in the ear); and axillary (under the 
armpit). Rectal is most often used with infants and is the most accurate 
method. Oral is the next most accurate method, and is also the most widely used 
in children above the age of 4, and adults. The tympanic method requires a 
digital thermometer, and is often used in children over the age of 3. Axillary 
is the least accurate method.</p> 
<h3>Taking Temperatures</h3> 
<p>Rectal Method (infants)</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use small amount of lubricant on end of rectal thermometer</li> 
<li>Place infant on belly and carefully separate buttocks cheeks</li> 
<li>Carefully insult the thermometer &frac12; &ndash; 1 inch into the 
infant&rsquo;s rectum</li> 
<li>Keep hand cupped loosely on infant&rsquo;s bottom and keep fingers on the 
thermometer so the thermometer and baby are still</li> 
<li>Wait for the thermometer to beep, or wait for three minutes if not using a 
digital thermometer</li> </ul> 
<h3>Oral Method</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Clean the tip of the thermometer with soap and warm water or rubbing 
alcohol. Rinse with cool water</li> 
<li>Put tip under tongue</li> 
<li>Close lips gently around thermometer</li> 
<li>Keep thermometer under tongue until thermometer beeps, or for three 
minutes if not using a digital thermometer</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tympanic Method</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Put a new, throw-away cover over the tip of the thermometer</li> 
<li>Keep head still</li> 
<li>For child, gently pull child&rsquo;s ear straight back; for adult, gently 
pull ear up and then back</li> 
<li>Put covered thermometer tip into the ear opening. DO NOT push hard.</li> 
<li>Press the button to turn on the thermometer and hold the button until the 
thermometer beeps (or follow manufacturer instructions)</li> 
<li>Remove thermometer from the ear opening</li> </ul> 
<h3>Axillary Method</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Place thermometer in the armpit with arms crossed over chest</li> 
<li>Wait for the beep, or wait four to five minutes if not using a digital 
thermometer</li> </ul> 
<h2>Causes of Fever</h2> 
<p>Our body temperature is set by the hypothalamus, which is an area in the 
brain that acts as a thermostat for our bodies. The thermoregulatory set point 
is determined by balancing the heat produced by body tissues such as the liver 
and muscles, and the heat lost by the body.</p> 
<p>The thermoregulatory set point is increased in response to threats, such as 
bacterial or viral infections, resulting in a higher body temperature as the 
body directs blood away from the skin to decrease heat loss. When the fever 
occurs, there are feelings of chilliness, stiffness and shivering caused by the 
body generating heat until the blood around the hypothalamus reaches the new, 
elevated set point. When the body temperature then begins to return to normal, 
there is often sweating as the body attempts to get rid of the excess heat.</p> 
<p>The most common cause of a fever is infections, such as the flu or a cold. 
However, other possibilities include</p> 
<ul> 
<li>inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis</li> 
<li>extreme sunburn</li> 
<li>heat exhaustion</li> 
<li>surgery</li> 
<li>heart attack</li> 
<li>hemorrhage</li> 
<li>hyperthyroidism</li> 
<li>lupus</li> 
<li>inflammatory bowel disease</li> 
<li>malignant tumor or some form of kidney cancer</li> 
<li>side effect of some immunizations</li> 
<li>side effect of some medications</li> </ul> 
<h2>Symptoms of Fever</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>dehydration</li> 
<li>general weakness</li> 
<li>headache</li> 
<li>inability to concentrate</li> 
<li>loss of appetite</li> 
<li>muscle aches</li> 
<li>sweating</li> 
<li>trembling, shivering</li> </ul> 
<h3>High fevers between 103F and 106F may cause</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>confusion</li> 
<li>convulsions</li> 
<li>hallucinations</li> 
<li>irritability</li> </ul> 
<h3>Febrile Seizures</h3> 
<p>Children under the age of 5 can experience fever induced seizures, 
otherwise known as febrile seizures. A febrile seizure occurs when a 
child&rsquo;s temperature rises or falls quickly. The signs of a febrile 
seizure include convulsions and a brief loss of consciousness.</p> 
<p>Febrile seizures occur in approximately 3% of children between the ages of 
18 months and 3 years. Of those children, 1/3 will have another seizure with 
febrile episode. These seizures do not generally cause long term side effects 
or damage to the nervous system</p> 
<h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3> 
<p>Low fevers are generally not cause for alarm. In fact, if the fever does 
not cause discomfort and there are no troubling symptoms accompanying a low 
fever, it should go untreated to allow the body&rsquo;s natural defenses to 
combat the underlying illness. However, there are times when medical attention 
is necessary.</p> 
<h3>Medical attention should be sought when</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>temperature is 104F or higher (seek IMMEDIATE medical attention! A 
temperature this high can lead to delirium and convulsions)</li> 
<li>a child under 3 months of age has a temperature of 101F or higher</li> 
<li>infant refuses to eat or drink</li> 
<li>fever in infant is accompanied by unexplained irritability, or unusual 
crying during a diaper change or when moved</li> 
<li>fever in infant is accompanied by lethargy and unresponsiveness</li> 
<li>fever in a child occurs after being left in a hot car</li> 
<li>there is a history of cancer, HIV, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, or other 
serious illness</li> 
<li>other symptoms suggest major illness</li> 
<li>fever is sustained for more than 3 days</li> </ul> 
<h2>Risk Factors</h2> 
<p>As fevers are usually signs of an underlying medical condition, the risk 
factors for a fever go hand in hand with the risk factors for the underlying 
medical condition. Exposure to illness, family history of more serious ailments 
causing fever, and a weakened immune system are all risk factors for 
contracting a illness, and thus for experiencing a fever. The exact factors 
putting individuals at risk for developing a fever depend greatly on the cause 
of the underlying medical condition that causes the fever.</p> 
<h3>How to Prevent a Fever</h3> 
<p>In order to prevent a fever, exposure to underlying medical conditions must 
be reduced. The most effective way to reduce exposure to the underlying medical 
conditions causing fever is to wash hands frequently, particularly before 
eating, after using the restroom, after exposure to a crowd or someone who is 
sick, and after petting animals.<br>
<br>
 Developing good hand washing 
practices is imperative to prevention, and should be taught to children as soon 
as possible.</p> 
<p>Avoiding touching the &ldquo;T-zone&rdquo; of your face&mdash;eyes, nose, 
mouth&mdash;helps to prevent fever by reducing the spreading of viral 
infections.</p> 
<p>In addition to hand washing and avoiding touching the &ldquo;T-zone&rdquo; 
of your face, covering your mouth when coughing and nose when sneezing helps to 
prevent the transmission of infection, and thus prevents fever.</p> 
<h3>Three rules to prevention</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Wash hands frequently</li> 
<li>Cover your cough and sneeze</li> 
<li>Avoid the &ldquo;T-zone&rdquo;</li> </ol> 
<h2>Treatment</h2> 
<p>High-grade temperatures, as opposed to low-grade, may be treated to lower 
their severity. The treatment for fever depends greatly on the underlying 
medical condition causing the fever. If the underlying medical condition is a 
bacterial infection, prescription medications such as antibiotics will be 
prescribed.</p> 
<p>However, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. For any 
underlying illness causing the fever that cannot be treated with prescription 
medications, over-the-counter medications or home remedies may be used. It is 
important to note that these over-the-counter medications and home remedies do 
not cure the fever or the underlying medical ailment. Rather, these treatments 
alleviate the symptoms of the fever.</p> 
<h3>Over-the-counter medications</h3> 
<p>Over-the-counter medications used to treat a fever include acetaminophen 
(Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), and aspirin. These help to lower a high 
fever, but will not cure it. Acetaminophen should not be used if the person 
with a fever has liver disease. Adults may take 2 extra strength tablets 
(totaling 1000 mg) every 4-6 hours.</p> 
<p>Children should seek medical advice. Ibuprofen is safe for children over 6 
months in age, though medical advice should be sought regarding proper dosage. 
Adults may take 2-3 200mg tablets every six hours. Aspirin should NOT be used 
with children or adolescents, due to concerns with a serious illness called 
Reyes Syndrome. Aspirin is, however, safe for adults.</p> 
<h3>Home Remedies</h3> 
<p>There are various home remedies that, while they will not cure the 
underlying illness, will help the fever run its course, and make a person 
suffering from a fever feel better</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Drink water, juice, or broth. Fever causes 
fluid loss and dehydration so it is important to keep sipping something in 
order to keep the body hydrated.</li> 
<li>Rest. Activity can raise body temperature, so plenty of rest is 
recommended to help body temperature return to normal</li> 
<li><strong>Soak in lukewarm water.</strong> Tepid water (85F) baths may help 
bring temperature down. Soak for 5-10 minutes for a cooling effect. Do not use 
alcohol, and if the bath causes shivering, stop the bath. Shivering raises the 
body&rsquo;s temperature, so will have an opposite effect on the fever.</li> 
<li><strong>Herbal Tea.</strong> Various recipes of tea are available that 
claim to aid in the reduction of a fever. These include Basil Leaf Tea drank 
3-4 times per day during the fever; tea with &frac12; teaspoon cinnamon powder, 
2 cardamoms, and 2 teaspoons ginger boiled well; 2-3 teaspoons dry roasted 
fenugreek seed powder boiled and strained with a drop of butter added; and 10 
grams raisins and ginger boiled in 200 ml water until it is reduced to 50 ml, 
with the water then strained and drank.</li> 
<li><strong>Herbs.</strong> Various herbs, independent of the herbal tea, are 
thought to be good treatments for fever. 7-8 tulsi leaves (basil) and 3-4 
peppercorns chewed together is supposed to help a fever, as is a teaspoon of 
honey with 2-3 drops of ginger juice.</li> </ul> 
<p>While high-grade fevers may be treated to alleviate the symptoms of the 
fever, low-grade fevers should not be treated with either over-the-counter 
medications or home remedies. Treating low-grade fevers may extend the length 
of the illness and interfere with the body&rsquo;s immune response. In these 
cases, allowing the body to combat the illness is the best option.</p> 
<p>While fevers are the body&rsquo;s natural defense against illness, it is 
important to remember that sometimes our body needs a little help. Don&rsquo;t 
put off seeking medical attention if the fever is accompanied by worrisome 
symptoms, if the fever is exceptionally high, or if the fever does not decrease 
after taking medication.</p>  VN:F [1.9.13_1145] <br>
