<strong>
Aspirin and related drugs (salicylates)</strong> 
<p>Aspirin is commonly used to treat many forms of arthritis. Although aspirin 
is often very important, medication is only part of a total treatment program 
for arthritis. You need to learn from your doctor what else to do for your 
disease. A typical program includes medication therapy as well asexercise, 
rest, and joint protection.</p> 
<p>The salicylates are a family of related drugs that reduce the effects of 
inflammation, a reaction of the body that causes pain, swelling, redness, and 
heat. The word salicylate refers to the active ingredient in the drugs. Aspirin 
(acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) is one of these drugs.</p> 
<p>Many of the others are chemically related to aspirin. Although salicylates 
differ from each other slightly in chemical structure, they have similar 
effects in the body. These drugs break down into salicylate, a chemical that is 
found in the bark of willow trees and in certain plants. Small amounts of 
salicylate can relieve headaches, mild pain, and fever. Larger amounts taken 
regularly over a period of time relieve some of the pain, heat, redness, and 
swelling associated with the inflammation of many forms of arthritis. Still 
larger amounts can cause toxicity (poisoning), which may be mild or severe.</p> 
<p>Patients whose joint pain persists despite aspirin or NSAIDs for joint pain 
may have a serious orthopedic condition. Older patients with knee pain, hip 
pain, shoulder pain, or elbow pain may have arthritis, and there are surgical 
options for managing this -- includingminimally-invasive knee replacement, 
total hip replacement, shoulder replacement, or elbow replacement, depending on 
the joint involved. Younger patients whose knee pain persists despite NSAIDs 
may have ameniscus tear, which may be repairable. </p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong></p> 
<p>Aspirin and the other salicylates belong to a group of drugs called 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or NSAIDs for short).</p> 
<p>All NSAIDs have the ability to reduce the effects of inflammation present 
in most types of arthritis. They are not related to the steroid drugs, which 
are a different group of well-known anti-inflammatory drugs similar to hormones 
such as cortisone. The NSAIDs appear to work by blocking the action of various 
body chemicals, which cause some of the pain and inflammation of arthritis.</p> 
<p>An advantage of aspirin over the other NSAIDs is that aspirin costs less. 
Because a person with arthritis must take medication for a long time, aspirin's 
fairly low cost is often a major factor in the choice of drug treatment.</p> 
<p>Patients whose joint pain persists despite aspirin or NSAIDs for joint pain 
may have a serious orthopedic condition. Older patients with knee pain, hip 
pain, shoulder pain, or elbow pain may have arthritis, and there are surgical 
options for managing this -- includingminimally-invasive knee replacement, 
total hip replacement, shoulder replacement, or elbow replacement, depending on 
the joint involved. Younger patients whose knee pain persists despite NSAIDs 
may have ameniscus tear, which may be repairable. </p> 
<p><strong>Dosage</strong></p> 
<p>Arthritis affects people in different ways. For this reason, only your 
physician can determine how much aspirin you need to effectively treat the 
symptoms of your disease, and how much you can tolerate.</p> 
<p>You could make a serious mistake if you tried to figure out your own dosage 
schedule. Each person's body handles salicylates differently. A certain daily 
dose may be too small for one person, just right for another, or cause serious 
toxicity for another.</p> 
<p>To determine the best dose of aspirin for you, the doctor may check your 
blood level from time to time. He or she may also ask you to be aware of 
certain side effects. When the proper dose has been determined, it must be 
taken regularly. &quot;Regularly&quot; means at certain times of the day, every 
day--not just when you're in pain. A certain level of aspirin must be 
maintained in your blood to control swelling, pain, and stiffness. Therefore, 
the benefits of aspirin may be lost if it is not taken as prescribed by your 
physician.</p> 
<p>Different brands of aspirin contain different amounts of the drug in each 
tablet. Be sure to check the dosage your doctor has prescribed with the amount 
per tablet you are taking. A standard tablet contains 5 grains of aspirin, 
which is equal to 325 milligrams of the drug. Aspirin advertised as 
&quot;arthritis strength&quot; or &quot;extra strength&quot; contains more 
aspirin per tablet (usually 500 mg). This is the same amount of aspirin as if 
you simply took more tablets of another brand with less aspirin in each pill.
</p> 
<p>Many common pain and cold remedies also contain some aspirin. You should 
not take one of them in addition to your regular aspirin without first checking 
with your doctor. You could be overdosing yourself without realizing it. Always 
read the labels of drugs you buy without a prescription before taking them. 
Check to see if they contain aspirin or other salicylates.</p> 
<p><strong>Warnings</strong></p>  Aspirin can be taken safely with many other 
medications. There are some drugs, however, such as certain ones taken forgout 
and diabetes, that should not be taken with aspirin. It is very important to 
tell your doctor all the drugs you are taking for any condition. This includes 
any medications bought without a prescription and those prescribed by another 
doctor. 
<p><strong>Brand selection</strong></p> 
<p>Always read the ingredients listed on the label of other products, 
especially those for pain, headaches, and other types of discomfort. 
&quot;Acetylsalicylic acid&quot; or &quot;salicylate&quot; are the key 
ingredients to look for.</p> 
<p>Not all aspirin or salicylate tablets are the same. They come in several 
forms that have been developed to be more convenient to take and, sometimes, to 
help avoid stomach distress. These include liquid forms, buffered tablets, 
tablets with a special coating (called enteric coating) that keeps them from 
dissolving in the stomach, and capsules or tablets that release aspirin very 
slowly into the bloodstream. There are also the other salicylates--the 
chemically modified types of aspirin--which are longer acting than aspirin and 
can be taken less often.</p> 
<p>Non brand-name or generic aspirin usually costs less and works just as well 
as popular brands. The least expensive way to buy plain aspirin is in bottles 
of 1,000 tablets. If you tolerate a certain brand, stay with it. Differences in 
the way various tablets dissolve may cause some brands to irritate the stomach 
more than other brands.</p> 
<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p> 
<p>Safety regulations require that aspirin products, like all drugs sold 
without prescriptions, must be packaged in containers that are both 
tamper-resistant and child resistant. Unfortunately, these packages may be very 
difficult to open for people whose hands are affected by arthritis. There are, 
however, ways to overcome this problem.</p> 
<p>Most aspirin producers offer one size that is not child-resistant (usually 
small sizes that aren't as economical as larger ones). If you have trouble 
opening the packaging or the container itself, ask the pharmacist or clerk to 
transfer the medicine to an easy-to-open container for you. Friends and family 
members can do the same.</p> 
<p>Always keep aspirin and other medications safely out of reach of children 
to avoid accidental poisonings, which may be fatal.</p> 
<p><strong>NSAIDs</strong></p> 
<p>Aspirin, salicylates, and many over the counter pain relievers belong to a 
group of drugs called the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (or NSAIDs for 
short).</p> 
<p>Three of the main types of NSAIDs that arthritis patient often use are 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and analgesic (pain-relieving) rubs.</p> 
<p><strong>Acetaminophen</strong></p> 
<p>Acetaminophen is used for relief of headaches, fever, and mild pain. 
However, it does not reduce the inflammation that is present in many forms of 
arthritis. Some brand names include Tylenol and Datril. You can substitute it 
for aspirin or other salicylates to control pain, but not for the reduction of 
inflammation. Your doctor will let you know whether acetaminophen would be 
useful for you.</p> 
<p>Aspirin is often combined with acetaminophen in a single tablet for relief 
of arthritis and other painful conditions. Sometimes other drugs such as 
caffeine, an antihistamine, nasal drying agents, and sedatives are also added. 
Although some of these preparations may have special uses for certain acute 
conditions such as a cold or a headache, they should not be taken for a chronic 
(long-term) form of arthritis. If a combination is required, each drug should 
be prescribed separately. The dose of each should be adjusted individually to 
achieve the greatest benefit with the fewest side effects.</p> 
<p><strong>Ibuprofen</strong></p>  Ibuprofen is an NSAID that is now available 
without a prescription for control of aches, pains, fever, and menstrual 
cramps. (Some brand-name examples are Advil and Nuprin.) The benefits of this 
drug are similar to those of aspirin, but overdoses are less likely to cause 
serious illness than are overdoses of aspirin. 
<p><strong>Analgesic (pain-relieving) rubs</strong></p> 
<p>Analgesic (pain-relieving) rubs are liquids or ointments that often contain 
some form of salicylate. They are meant to be rubbed onto the skin over a 
painful area such as a joint for short-term pain relief. They produce their 
effect by creating a sensation of numbness and warmth in the skin, which may 
provide some feeling of relief from the underlying pain. They may also work as 
counter-irritants that increase local blood flow and modify the perception of 
pain.</p> 
<p>The salicylates and other substances such as menthol and camphor in these 
rubs are not well absorbed. This means that they do not penetrate the skin and 
reach underlying painful joints. Only a small amount actually reaches the 
circulation to be spread throughout the body. These rubs do not reduce 
inflammation.</p> 
<p>Analgesic rubs are very toxic if taken internally. They should be kept away 
from children.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Overdose</strong></p>  Aspirin is very useful, but it has many side 
effects and therefore must be used carefully. Like most powerful drugs, an 
overdose of aspirin or salicylates can be fatal. If a child or adult takes an 
overdose of aspirin, induce vomiting to empty the unabsorbed medication from 
the stomach (if the person is still awake and conscious). Obtain emergency 
medical care right away. 
<p><strong>Common side effects</strong></p>  The most common side effects of 
aspirin are heartburn and other symptoms of stomach irritation such as 
indigestion, pain, nausea, and vomiting. The stomach irritation may lead to 
bleeding from the stomach, which may cause black stools. These symptoms may be 
reduced by taking aspirin with meals, with an antacid, with a glass of milk, or 
by taking enteric-coated or timed-release aspirin. Also, it is best not to take 
aspirin with alcohol or coffee (or other beverages containing caffeine, such as 
tea or cocoa and many soft drinks). Alcohol and caffeine make the stomach more 
sensitive to irritation. The non aspirin salicylate preparations sometimes are 
less irritating to the stomach and may be substituted for aspirin by your 
doctor. 
<p><strong>Other effects</strong></p> 
<p>A few people develop asthma, hay fever, nasal congestion, or hives from 
aspirin or NSAIDs. These people should never take aspirin, nor should people 
who have active stomach or duodenal ulcers. Anyone who has ever had a peptic 
ulcer should be very careful about taking aspirin because it can lead to a 
recurrence.</p> 
<p>Aspirin is known to interfere with the action of the platelets (blood cells 
involved in clotting). As a result, some people who take a lot of aspirin 
experience easy bruising of the skin. Therefore, people who have major bleeding 
problems should not take aspirin. Also, keep in mind that aspirin should not be 
taken for 10-14 days before surgery (including surgery in the mouth) to avoid 
excessive bleeding during or after the operation.</p> 
<p>High doses of salicylate may cause ringing in the ears and slight deafness. 
If these effects occur, reduce your dose and call your doctor for further 
instructions. Your physician may decide to check your blood aspirin level and 
may even ask you to tolerate these symptoms without cutting your dose. 
Sometimes, however, these symptoms indicate mild overdose, which could become 
more serious. This problem should be discussed carefully with your doctor.</p> 
<p>Aspirin and NSAIDs sometimes affect the normal function of the kidneys, or 
they can cause fluid to accumulate in the body. If you have liver, kidney, or 
breast disease, get your doctor's advice before taking these drugs. If you 
begin to swell up, gain a lot of weight, or feel ill while taking one of these 
drugs, stop taking it immediately and contact your doctor.</p> 
<p><strong>Effects on children</strong></p> 
<p>Recent reports have said there could be a link between the use of aspirin 
and the development of Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a rare but possibly 
fatal disease seen most often in children and teenagers. It usually affects 
those recovering from chicken pox or a viral illness such as the flu. These 
reports have raised concern in pediatricians (doctors who specialize in 
treating children) and parents of children with arthritis who need to take 
large doses of aspirin to control their disease.</p> 
<p>Presently, there is no conclusive proof showing how often Reye's syndrome 
occurs in children with arthritis who are or are not taking aspirin. Results 
from a survey of doctors who specialize inchildhood arthritis and related 
diseases have not shown that children with arthritis who regularly take large 
doses of aspirin have a high risk of developing Reye's syndrome. There have 
been some reports of a few children with arthritis developing Reye's syndrome.
</p> 
<p>At present, there appears to be no reason to limit the use of aspirin in 
children with arthritis. However, if a child with arthritis who is taking 
aspirin develops symptoms of chicken pox, flu, or any viral illness that has 
fever as a symptom, the aspirin should be stopped. The child's doctor should be 
contacted right away.</p> 
<p><strong>Getting proper medical help</strong></p> 
<p>Many aspirin ads and commercials make arthritis sound as if it were nothing 
more than minor aches and pains. The truth is that arthritis can be serious, 
the pain can be extreme, and it can cause deformity unless a careful treatment 
program is begun early in the course of the disease.</p> 
<p>Don't let advertising lead you to diagnose and treat yourself for 
arthritis. There is much more to controlling arthritis than getting 
&quot;wonderful relief.&quot; Arthritis isn't something to fool around with. If 
you medicate yourself and stay away from the doctor, your affected joints may 
suffer damage that can't be reversed. Take arthritis seriously and get proper 
medical help.</p> 
<p><strong>Unproven remedies</strong></p> 
<p>Unproven remedies are treatments that have not yet shown that they both 
work and are safe. They can include products, drugs, diets, and procedures. 
Sometimes &quot;special formula&quot; medicines are promoted for the relief of 
arthritis. Often these contain more than one ingredient, and the chief one (the 
only one that may help the arthritis) is some form of aspirin. These products 
may be offered at very high prices.</p> 
<p>In addition, keep in mind that, because of the changing course of 
arthritis, it may appear that an unproven remedy caused improvement. The best 
guide to remember is to stay with your prescribed treatment plan. It involves 
treatments that have worked and have been proven safe in large numbers of 
people. Although some unproven remedies are not dangerous, others can be very 
harmful. If you have questions about an unproven remedy, contact your doctor.
</p> 
<p><strong>Seeking Professional Advice</strong></p> 
<p>Patients whose joint pain persists despite aspirin or NSAIDs for joint pain 
may have a serious orthopedic condition. Older patients with knee pain, hip 
pain, shoulder pain, or elbow pain may have arthritis, and there are surgical 
options for managing this -- includingminimally-invasive knee replacement, 
total hip replacement, shoulder replacement, or elbow replacement, depending on 
the joint involved. Younger patients whose knee pain persists despite NSAIDs 
may have ameniscus tear, which may be repairable. </p> 
<p><strong>Promising findings</strong></p> 
<p>Current research efforts are continuing to find possible new uses for 
aspirin.</p> 
<p>In the field of immunology (the study of the body's immune system), 
promising results have been reported in which aspirin has helped strengthen the 
body's immune system. This could provide new information about aspirin's effect 
on the course ofrheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which the immune system is 
defective. Also, recent studies have suggested that daily, low doses of aspirin 
may reduce blood clotting and therefore lower a person's risk of stroke or 
heart attack.</p> 
<p><strong>Things to remember</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do see a qualified physician for diagnosis and treatment of arthritis. 
Avoid or reduce serious problems by not trying to treat yourself.</li> 
<li>Proper treatment prescribed by a physician can control the disease and 
lessen joint damage.</li> 
<li>Do take aspirin, if the doctor prescribes it, in the exact amount and the 
exact schedule he or she has told you to take it.</li> 
<li>Don't change your aspirin dosage schedule without first asking your 
physician.</li> 
<li>Don't be lured by advertising into treating yourself on a homemade 
schedule. Even though arthritis may begin with &quot;minor aches and 
pains,&quot; it is nothing to fool around with. If pain continues and stiffness 
and joint swelling occur, get qualified medical advice and get it early.</li> 
<li>Be careful of unproven remedies. Before you buy or try, consult your 
physician.</li> 
<li>If a child with arthritis who is taking aspirin develops symptoms of 
chicken pox, flu, or any viral illness that has fever as a symptom, stop the 
aspirin. Contact the doctor right away.</li> 
<li>Women who become pregnant should discuss with their physicians whether or 
not to continue taking aspirin or similar products.</li> 
<li>If you have further questions regarding aspirin or any other medication, 
be sure to consult your doctor.</li> </ul>
