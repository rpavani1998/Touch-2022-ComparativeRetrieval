<p><strong>Ear Infections (Otitis Media) in Children</strong> </p> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE EAR INFECTIONS (OTITIS MEDIA) IN CHILDREN? </strong>
</p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 The Ear </strong></p><br>
The ear is the organ of hearing and 
balance and is organized into external, middle, and internal areas. 
<ul> 
<li> The outer ear collects sound waves that are conducted through a canal 
(the entrance of which is called the<i>external auditory meatus </i>) to the <i>
tympanic membrane</i>, commonly called the eardrum. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The tympanic membrane is a tissue that is lined on the inside with mucus. 
Like a drum, it vibrates to the incoming sound waves, converting them into 
mechanical energy.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> This energy resonates through the middle ear, a complex structure filled 
with air and composed of tiny bones that vibrate to the rhythm of the ear drum 
and pass the sound waves on to the inner ear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The inner ear is filled with fluid. Here, hair-like structures stimulate 
nerves to convert the mechanical waves to electrochemical impulses that are 
carried by a network of nerve cells to the brain, which senses these impulses 
as sounds.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The inner ear also contains three semi-circular canals that function as 
the body's gyroscope, regulating balance.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> An important structure in the ear is the Eustachian tube, which runs from 
the middle ear to the passages behind the nose and the upper part of the 
throat. This tube ventilates the ear and equalizes the air pressure in the 
middle ear to the outside air pressure. (Problems with this tube's function are 
primary factors in most cases of ear infection.) </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Ear Infections (Otitis Media) in Children </strong></p><br>

Ear infections are often defined by whether they are acute (acute otitis media) 
or chronic (otitis media with effusion).<br>
<br>
<i>Acute Otitis Media (AOM). 
</i> Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection in the middle ear that causes an 
inflammation behind the tympanic membrane. 
<ul> 
<li> Often it develops during or after a cold or a flu. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Middle ear infections are extremely common in children but are infrequent 
in adults.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In children, ear infections often recur, particularly if they first 
develop in early infancy. </li> </ul> <i>Otitis Media with Effusion </i> (OME) 
<i>.</i> Otitis media with effusion (OME) occurs when an effusion (fluid) 
builds up in one or both middle ears. When this is chronic and severe the fluid 
is very sticky and is commonly called &quot;glue ear.&quot;; 
<ul> 
<li> It is not painful and the only clue that it is present is a feeling of 
stuffiness in the ears, which can feel like &quot;being under water.&quot;;<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Children who are susceptible to OME can have frequent episodes for more 
than half of their first three years of life.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The episodes can last from weeks to months. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT CAUSES MIDDLE EAR INFECTIONS (OTITIS MEDIA) IN CHILDREN? 
</strong></p><br>
Otitis media (middle ear infection) is most often the result 
of a combination of factors that increase susceptibility to infections by 
specific organisms in the middle ear. 
<p><strong><br>
 Conditions that Predispose a Person to Ear Infections 
</strong></p><br>
<i>Problems in the Eustachian Tube. </i>Many bacteria thrive 
in the passages of the nose and throat. Most are benign and some are even 
important in preventing harmful bacteria from getting out of control. In 
addition, the body has a number of defenses that prevent the harmful bacteria 
from replicating and infecting deeper passages, such as those in the ear.<br>

<br> However, various factors can impair these defenses. Such factors may 
include, but are not limited to the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Viral infection. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Smoke particles. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Allergies, such as hay fever, that affect the nasal passages (allergic 
rhinitis). </li> </ul> In general, these or other irritants can produce the 
following conditions that lead to ear infection: 
<ul> 
<li> Irritation from viruses, smoke particles, or allergies can cause the 
membranes along the walls of the inner passages to become inflamed, swell, and 
obstruct the airways.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If this inflammation blocks the narrow Eustachian tube so that it can not 
drain the middle ear properly, fluid builds up.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> This fluid can then become a reservoir and breeding ground for bacteria 
and subsequent infection. </li> </ul> The Eustachian tubes in all children are 
shorter and smaller than in adults and therefore more vulnerable to 
obstruction. Children with shorter-than-normal and relatively horizontal 
Eustachian tubes are at particular risk for recurrent infections.<br>
<br>
<i>
Genetic Factors.</i>Several studies suggest that multiple genetic factors may 
play a role in making a child susceptible to otitis media. 
<ul> 
<li> For example, genetic susceptibility to certain bacteria may result in 
development of persistent and recurrent otitis media.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Abnormalities in genes that affect the defense systems (cilia and mucus 
production) and the anatomy of the skull and passages would also increase the 
risk for ear infections. </li> </ul> Researchers are hoping that these findings 
may encourage primary care physicians to closely monitor children who are 
offspring or siblings of individuals with a history of unusually frequent or 
severe upper respiratory tract infections. 
<p><strong><br>
 Infecting Agents </strong></p><br>
<i>Bacteria. </i>Certain 
bacteria are the primary causes of acute otitis media (AOM) and are detected in 
about 60% of cases. The bacteria most commonly causing ear infections are: 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>(also called the pneumococcus) is the 
most common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, causing about 50% to 80% of 
cases.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Haemophilus influenzae </i> is the next most common culprit and is 
responsible for 20% to 30% of acute infections.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Moraxella</i> <i>catarrhalis </i>is also a common infectious agent, 
responsible for 10% to 15% of infections.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Less common bacteria are <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>and<i> 
Staphylococcus aureus</i>. </li> </ul> Of note, about 15% of these bacteria are 
now believed to be resistant to the first-choice antibiotics.<br>
<br>
<i>
Viruses.</i>Studies have reported the presence of viruses in the middle ear 
fluid in about 40% of children with ear infections. While viruses are not 
usually a direct cause of otitis media, they may play an important role by 
causing inflammation in the nasal passages and impairing defense systems, such 
as cilia, in the ear. 
<ul> 
<li> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus responsible for upper 
and lower respiratory infections, and influenza viruses (&quot;Flu&quot;;) are 
prime suspects in this process.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Rhinovirus, a cause of the common cold, has been found in between 1% and 
8% of otitis media cases, and, in one study 74% of patients with rhinovirus 
caused colds had middle-ear pressure abnormalities. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Causes of Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) </strong></p><br>

In some cases, otitis media with effusion develops after an acute otitis media 
attack, although often the direct cause of OME is unknown.<br>
<br>
 It is not 
clear, for example, what role bacteria or other infectious agents play. 
Standard tests do not detect bacteria in 40% to 60% of cultures taken from 
fluid in OME-affected ears. (In one study, a sophisticated test found genetic 
evidence of<i>Haemophilus influenza </i>bacteria in about a third of specimens 
in which no bacteria were detected by standard culture techniques.)<br>
<br>
 
Susceptibility to OME is almost always due to an abnormal or malfunctioning 
Eustachian tube that causes a negative pressure in the middle ear, which, in 
turn, allows fluid to leak in through capillaries. 
<ul> 
<li> Problems in the Eustachian tube can be due to viral infections, 
second-hand smoke, injury, or birth defects, such as cleft palate.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Rare genetic conditions, such as Kartagener's syndrome, in which the 
cilia (hair-like structures) in the ear are immobile and cause fluid build up, 
can contribute to OME. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHO GETS EAR INFECTIONS?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 General Risk Factors for Ear Infections </strong></p><br>

Acute ear infections are the most common reason for childhood visits to the 
doctor. About 62% of children can expect to have a least one attack of acute 
otitis media (AOM) in their first year and 80% will have had an infection by 
age three. And, the incidence of AOM has been rising over the past decades. One 
study reported a 44% increase in prevalence between 1981 and 1988, with infants 
particularly affected. In American children, otitis media is second in 
prevalence only to the common cold.<br>
<br>
<i>Gender and Age. </i>Boys are 
more apt to have infections than girls are, and the risk is higher the younger 
the child: 
<ul> 
<li> About 17% of all children under two have recurrent ear infections (i.e., 
three or more episodes within a six-month period). The earlier a child has a 
first ear infection the more susceptible he or she is to recurrent episodes. 
The peak incidence occurs between seven and nine months of age.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> As children grow, however, the structures in their ears enlarge and their 
immune systems become stronger. By 16 months the risk for recurrent infections 
is rapidly declining. Still, about two thirds of children have had at least one 
acute ear infection by the time they are three years old.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Half of the cases of otitis media with effusion (OME) appear to develop 
within the first year of life. In one study, 18% of healthy children between 
birth and age three had frequent recurrences of OME in one or both ears. 
(Because OME has fewer symptoms than acute otitis media, however, its 
prevalence among very young children is unclear.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> After age five, most children have outgrown their susceptibility to any 
ear infections. </li> </ul> <i>Other General Risk Factors. </i>The following 
children also have higher risks for ear infections. 
<ul> 
<li> Children with a family history of ear infections. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Children from lower socioeconomic groups. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Increased Co-Incidence in Other Airway Infections and 
Disorders</strong></p><br>
Increased diagnosis of other disorders and 
infections of the upper and lower airways, such as asthma, allergies, and 
sinusitis, have paralleled the rise in ear infections. For example, the same 
bacteria are often responsible for both ear infections and sinusitis. In one 
study, 38% of children with ear infections also had sinusitis, and other 
studies have reported that nearly half of children with OME have concurrent 
sinusitis. These studies may have overestimated the extent of clinically 
important sinus disease, but none the less, the association is significant. 
Researchers are looking for common risk factors: 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Day Care Center Attendance. </i> Although ear infections themselves 
are not contagious, the respiratory infections that precipitate them can pose a 
risk for children with close and frequent exposure to other children. Some 
experts believe, then, that the increase in ear and other infections may be due 
to the higher attendance of very small children, including infants, in day care 
centers beginning in the 1970s. For children who had the condition for a long 
time, however, neither day care attendance nor any other risk factor, including 
a history of upper respiratory tract infections or family history of OME, 
appeared to be relevant. Attendance in day care centers, then, may explain 
part, but not all, of the current increase in ear infections and other upper 
airway disorders.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Increase in Allergies. </i>Some experts believe that the increase in 
allergies is also partially responsible for the higher number of ear 
infections, which is unlikely to be related to day care attendance. Studies 
indicate that 40% to 50% of children over three years old who have chronic 
otitis media also have allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Allergies are also 
associated with asthma and sinusitis.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The rise in the rate of otitis media, then, is probably due to a 
combination of factors that are also responsible for the increase in these 
other airway problems. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Other Medical Problems that Increase Risk </strong></p><br>

<i>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disorder. </i>Gastroesophageal reflux disorder 
(GERD), in which acid backs up into the esophagus, is a common cause of 
heartburn in adults. In infants, GERD may occur when muscles in the upper part 
of the stomach are still immature and force acid back up, causing persistent 
vomiting. Some research also suggests that GERD in infants may contribute to 
sinusitis and ear infections by triggering inflammation in these upper passages.
<br> <br>
<i>Other Medical Disorders. </i> Other medical disorders, including 
Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and immunosuppressive disorders, such as HIV, 
increase the risk for ear infections. 
<p><strong><br>
 Parental Behavior </strong></p><br>
The behavior of parents 
can increase a child's risk for otitis media. 
<ul> 
<li> Parents who smoke pose a significant risk for both otitis media with 
effusion (OME) and recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) in their children.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Pregnant women who drink alcohol put their babies at risk for birth 
defects that can cause a number of problems, among them hearing loss and OME.
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Babies who are bottle-fed may have a higher risk for otitis media than do 
breast-fed babies because the mother's milk provides immune factors that help 
protect the child from infections. Researchers have reported that<i>
oligosaccarides</i>, sugar compounds found in milk, may have properties that 
help fight otitis media by preventing<i>S. pneumonia </i> bacteria from binding 
to the cells lining the respiratory tract. Also, to be breast fed, infants are 
held in a position that allows the Eustachian tubes to function well. To 
improve protection for bottle-fed babies, mothers should not lay babies down 
with their bottle; they should hold the infants in the same way they would to 
breast-feed them. </li> </ul> Several studies have found that the use of 
pacifiers place children at even higher risk for ear infections. Sucking 
increases production of saliva, which is a vehicle for bacteria that can travel 
up the Eustachian tubes to the middle ear.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?</strong>
</p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Symptoms of Acute Otitis Media </strong></p><br>
Symptoms of 
acute otitis media usually develop suddenly and can include: 
<ul> 
<li> Pain or discomfort in the ear. (It is difficult to determine if a 
preverbal child or infant has an ear infection. Some children may indicate pain 
if they have trouble swallowing food and rejecting it. Some parents believe 
that tugging on the ear indicates an infection, but this gesture is more likely 
to indicate pain from teething.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Coughing.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Nasal congestion. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Fever<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Irritability.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Loss of appetite. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Vomiting. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pus in the ear may cause hearing loss in some children. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If the ear infection is severe, the tympanic membrane may rupture causing 
the parent to notice pus draining from the ear. (This usually brings relief 
from pain.) </li> </ul> Fevers and colds often make children irritable and 
fussy, so it is difficult to determine if otitis media is present as well. In 
about a third of children with acute middle ear infection, symptoms are not 
apparent. 
<p><strong><br>
 Symptoms of Otitis Media with Effusion </strong></p><br>

Otitis media with effusion (OME) often has no symptoms at all. Some hearing 
loss may occur, but it is often fluctuating and hard to detect even by 
observant parents. The only signal to a parent that the condition exists may be 
when a child complains of &quot;plugged up&quot; hearing. There are some 
indications that older children with OME may have difficulty targeting specific 
sounds in a noisy room. (In such cases, some parents or teachers may attribute 
their behavior to lack of attention or even to an attention deficit disorder.) 
OME is often diagnosed only during a regular pediatric visit.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 HOW SERIOUS ARE EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Acute Otitis Media in Infancy </strong></p><br>
Any infant 
under three months old who shows signs of ear infection should be seen by a 
physician promptly, since acute otitis media in babies can sometimes be a sign 
of a more wide-spread infection, sometimes including meningitis. 
<p><strong><br>
 Hearing Loss and Delayed Development </strong></p><br>

Evidence strongly suggests that severe cases of recurrent acute otitis media 
and persistent otitis media with effusion (OME) impair hearing. The effect of 
long-term hearing problems can have the following effects: 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Learning Delays </i>. Hearing loss in children slows down language 
development and reading skills. Children with even mild hearing loss may miss 
spoken words and have trouble making sense out of a conversation or a lesson in 
school.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Behavioral and Social Problems. </i> Children with impaired hearing 
may appear to be distracted, inattentive, unintelligent, and may even be 
inaccurately diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> <i>Impaired Balance. </i>Some studies have indicated that children with 
chronic OME have problems with motor development and balance.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Speech Problems. </i>A few small studies have found speech problems in 
some young children with OME, but in one study the effect was limited to a 
group of Native American children. </li> </ul> It is not clear how significant 
the long-term effects of OME-related hearing loss are on learning in children. 
Some studies have suggested a weak association between mild to moderate hearing 
impairment and later learning and verbal problems. Many of these studies 
suggest that the effect on learning is not significant, however. In addition, 
some indicate that the lower learning scores may actually be due to the fact 
that children with ear infections tend to be in lower socioeconomic groups and 
so have less home attention.<br>
<br>
 Considering the increased usage of 
medications for attention deficit disorder, the costs of special education, and 
the social burdens carried by children diagnosed with emotional and learning 
disabilities, more research is essential for clarifying the long-term effects 
of hearing loss from recurrent or chronic ear infections. 
<p><strong><br>
 Physical and Structural Injury in the Face and Ears </strong>
</p><br>
Serious complications or permanent physical injuries from ear 
infections are very uncommon but may include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Very rarely, a child may develop facial paralysis, which is temporary and 
relieved by drainage surgery.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In severe or recurrent otitis media, certain children may be at risk for 
structural damage in the ear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Cysts in the ear known as <i>cholesteatomas</i> are an uncommon 
complication of recurrent or severe ear infections.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In rare cases, even after a mild infection, certain children, possibly 
because of immune abnormalities, develop calcification and hardening in the 
middle and, occasionally, in the inner ear. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Mastoiditis</strong></p><br>
Before the introduction of 
antibiotics, mastoiditis, an infection in the bones located in the skull, was a 
major and serious complication of otitis media. This condition is difficult to 
treat and requires intravenous antibiotics and drainage procedures. Surgery may 
be required. If pain and fever persist in spite of antibiotic treatment of 
otitis media, the physician should check for mastoiditis. Even without 
antibiotics this is a rare complication.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 HOW ARE EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN DIAGNOSED? </strong></p>
<br> Many experts believe that ear infections in children are overdiagnosed and 
overtreated with antibiotics. Parents should question their physician closely 
if they recommend antibiotics and feel comfortable if antibiotics are not 
diagnosed. 
<p><strong><br>
 Medical History </strong></p><br>
The physician should be 
sure to ask the parent for a history of any recent cold, flu, or other 
respiratory infections. If the child complains of pain or has other symptoms of 
otitis media, such as redness and inflammation, the physician should be sure to 
rule out any other causes of such symptoms. They may include, but are not 
limited to the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Dental problems (such as teething). <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Infection in the <i>outer</i> ear. Symptoms include pain, redness, 
itching, and discharge. Infection in the outer ear, however, can be confirmed 
by wiggling the ears, which will produce pain. (This movement will have no 
significant effect if the infection is in the middle ear.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Foreign objects in the ear. This can be dangerous and a physician should 
always check for this first when a small child indicates pain or problems in 
the ear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Viral infection can produce redness and inflammation. Such infections, 
however, are not treatable with antibiotics and resolve on their own.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> A parent's or child's attempts to remove earwax. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Intense crying can cause redness and inflammation in the ear. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Physical Examination </strong></p><br>
An ear examination 
should be part of any routine physical examination in children, particularly 
because the problem is so common and many children have no symptoms. 
<ul> 
<li> The physician first removes any ear wax (called <i>cerumen</i>) in order 
to get a clear view of the middle ear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The physician employs a small flashlight-like instrument called an <i>
otoscope</i> to view the ear directly. This is the most important diagnostic 
step. This instrument will reveal signs of acute otitis media, bulging eardrum, 
and blisters. The physician will also check color.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> To determine ear infection the physician should always use a <i>pneumatic
</i> otoscope. This device detects any reduction in eardrum motion. It has a 
rubber bulb attachment that the physician presses to push air into the ear. 
Pressing the bulb and observing the action of the air against the eardrum 
allows the physician to gauge the eardrum's mobility.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some physicians may use <i>tympanometry</i> to evaluate the ear. In this 
case a small probe is held to the entrance of the ear canal and forms an 
airtight seal. While the air pressure is varied, a sound with a fixed tone is 
directed at the eardrum and its energy is measured. This device can detect 
fluid in the middle air and also obstruction in the Eustachian tube.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> A procedure similar to tympanometry, called <i>reflectometry</i>, also 
measures reflected sound to detect fluid and obstruction but does not require 
an airtight seal at the canal. </li> </ul> It should be noted that neither 
tympanometry nor reflectometry are substitutes for the pneumatic otoscope, 
which allows a direct view of the middle ear. The physician will then assess 
the results of this examination to determine a diagnosis. 
<ul> 
<li> A normal eardrum is grayish-pink and translucent. An eardrum with acute 
otitis media is opaque and can be red, white, or yellowish. It is also less 
mobile.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If the eardrum is red and inflamed but mobile, the cause is more likely 
to be irritation rather than a bacterial infection.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If the eardrum is clear and translucent but is not mobile and if fluid is 
present, then otitis media with effusion (OME) is likely to be present.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A scarred, thick, or opaque eardrum may make it difficult for the 
physician to distinguish between acute otitis media and OME. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Tympanocentesis</strong></p><br>
On rare occasions the 
physician may need to draw fluid from the ear using a needle for identifying 
specific bacteria, a procedure called<i>tympanocentesis</i>. This procedure can 
also relieve severe ear pain. This is most often performed by ear, nose, and 
throat (ENT) specialists, and usually only in severe or recurrent cases. In 
most cases tympanocentesis is not necessary in order to obtain an accurate 
enough diagnosis for effective treatment. 
<p><strong><br>
 Determining Hearing Problems </strong></p><br>
Hearing tests 
performed by an audiologist are usually recommended for children with 
persistent otitis media with effusion. A hearing loss below 20 decibels usually 
indicates problems.<br>
<br>
<i>Determining Impaired Hearing in Infants and 
Small Children.</i>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to test children under 
two years old for hearing problems. One way to determine hearing problems in 
infants is to gauge the baby's language development: 
<ul> 
<li> At 4 four to 6 weeks most babies with normal hearing are making cooing 
sounds.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> By around 5 months the child should be laughing out loud and making 
one-syllable sounds with both a vowel and consonant.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Between 6 and 8 months, the infants should be able to make word-like 
sounds with more than one syllable.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Usually starting around 7 months the baby babbles (makes many word-like 
noises) and should be doing this by 10 months.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Around 10 months, the baby is able to identify and use some term for the 
parent, dada, baba, or mama.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The baby speaks his or her first word usually by the end of the first 
year. </li> </ul> If a child's progress is significantly delayed beyond these 
times, a parent should suspect possible hearing problems.<br>
<br>
<i>
Determining Impaired Hearing in Older Children.</i>Hearing loss in older 
children may be detected by the following behaviors: 
<ul> 
<li> They may not respond to speech spoken beyond three feet away. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> They may have difficulty following directions. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Their vocabulary may be limited. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> They may have social and behavioral problems. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE MEASURES FOR PREVENTING A FIRST EAR INFECTION? 
</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Breast-feeding </strong></p><br>
Breastfeeding offers 
protection against many early infections. If possible, new mothers should 
breast feed their infants for at least six months. 
<p><strong><br>
 Pacifier Use </strong></p><br>
There is some evidence to 
suggest that use of pacifiers may increase risk of otitis media in children 
under three years old. Nevertheless, some physicians believe any association is 
exaggerated and that the comfort a child derives from sucking (either thumb, 
breast, or pacifier) is more important any presumed increase risk for ear 
infection. 
<p><strong><br>
 Preventing and Treating Colds and Flus </strong></p><br>
The 
best way to prevent otitis media is to prevent a cold and influenza from 
developing in the first place and to treat them effectively when they do 
develop. Simple precautions for prevention of colds are eating plenty of fruits 
and vegetables, getting enough rest, and washing hands frequently.<br>
<br>
<i>
Good Hygiene.</i> Adults and children should wash their hands frequently. New 
antibacterial soaps add little protection and ordinary soap is sufficient. In 
fact, a recent study suggests that common liquid dishwashing soaps are up to 
100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV), which is known to cause pneumonia. Flus and colds are 
not spread by touching inanimate objects, such as subway poles or toilet seats. 
Bacteria do not thrive on such objects and of the organisms that do survive on 
inanimate objects, most are harmless.<br>
<br>
<i>Dietary Factors. </i> One 
analysis of studies found that large doses of vitamin C reduced the duration of 
colds by 21%. Infants and children, however, should not take large doses of 
vitamins. Fresh, dark-colored fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants 
and other important food chemicals, and daily diets containing such foods are 
important and sufficient for nearly everyone.<br>
<br>
<i>Reducing Stress. </i> 
Interestingly, giving children affection and helping them relax could help 
prevent colds. One study found that the more social interactions a person has 
the less likely they are to have a cold, possibly because stress hormones, 
which suppress the immune system, are reduced.<br>
<br>
<i>Alternative Cold 
Remedies.</i> Alternative agents, such as zinc and echinacea, are sold as 
remedies for prevention or reduction of cold symptoms. There is no strong 
evidence to support the claims for either of these substances and their side 
effects are also not fully known. [For more information<i> </i>94, <i>Colds and 
Influenza (the Flu)</i>.] 
<p><strong><br>
 Avoiding Exposure to Cigarette Smoke </strong></p><br>

Parents or others should not smoke around children. Several studies have found 
that children who live with smokers have a significant risk for ear infections. 
One study even suggested that the more the mother smoked the higher the risk.
<br> <br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE HOME REMEDIES USED FOR EAR INFECTIONS IN 
CHILDREN?</strong></p><br>
Treatments for ear infections cost the country 
between three and four billion dollars each year, and evidence is mounting that 
many of these treatments, particularly heavy antibiotic use and surgical 
procedures, may be unnecessary. 
<p><strong><br>
 Watchful Waiting </strong></p><br>
Careful monitoring of the 
child's condition (watchful waiting) along with home remedies and common over 
the counter cold medicines may be a viable alternative to antibiotic treatment 
for many children with a first episode of acute otitis media. 
<ul> 
<li> In one 2000 study, 240 children under age 2 who were diagnosed with acute 
otitis media were treated with watchful waiting. After four days, only 3% of 
the children required treatment with antibiotics, while the infection cleared 
in the other 97%. </li> </ul> Children, however, must be monitored carefully. 
<ul> 
<li> High fever, severe pain, or other signs of complications should warrant 
immediate attention by a medical professional.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Parents of infants should contact their doctor immediately if they have 
any fever, regardless other symptoms. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Natural Remedies </strong></p><br>
Before antibiotics, 
parents used home remedies to treat the pain of ear infections. Now, with 
current concern over antibiotic overuse, many of these remedies are back in 
favor. 
<ul> 
<li> Depending on regional cultures, parents may have pressed a warm water 
bottle or warm bag of salt against the ear. Such old-fashioned remedies may 
still help to ease ear pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Drops of tea tree oil may be beneficial. This herbal treatment has mild 
anti-bacterial properties, but it may irritate the skin. </li> </ul> <i>
Valsalva's Maneuver.</i> A simple technique called the Valsalva's maneuver is 
useful in opening the Eustachian tubes and providing occasional relief from the 
chronic stuffy feeling accompanying otitis media with effusion. It may also be 
useful for unplugging ears during air travel descent as well. It works as 
follows: 
<ul> 
<li> The child takes a deep breath and closes the mouth. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> He or she then blows the nose gently while, at the same time, pinching it 
firmly shut.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The parent should be sure to instruct the child not to blow too hard or 
the ear drum could be harmed. </li> </ul> This technique should not be used if 
an infection is present. 
<p><strong><br>
 Pain-Relievers</strong></p><br>
A number of pain relievers 
are available to help relieve symptoms. 
<ul> 
<li> Either acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (eg, Advil) is the 
pain-reliever of choice in children.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Older children may be able to take prescription pain relievers that 
contain codeine if the pain is severe.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Eardrops containing benzocaine, glycerin, and antipyrine (Auralgan) are 
also available by prescription. In one study Auralgan provided effective 
short-acting pain relief and helped children endure ear discomfort until an 
oral pain reliever took effect. Parents should check with a physician before 
using them. Eardrops could cause damage in children who have a ruptured 
eardrum. This might be indicated by fluid drainage from the ear canal. </li> 
</ul> Note: Aspirin and aspirin-containing products are not recommended for 
children or adolescents. Reports of Reye's Syndrome, a very serious condition, 
have been associated with aspirin use in children who have chicken pox or flu. 
<p><strong><br>
 Cold and Allergy Remedies </strong></p><br>
Many 
non-prescription products are available that combine antihistamines, 
decongestants, and other ingredients, and some are advertised as cold remedies 
for children. Researchers have found little or no benefits for acute otitis 
media or for otitis media with effusion using decongestants, antihistamines, or 
combination products, which include Dimetapp, Sudafed Severe Cold Formula, 
Vicks DayQuil, and Triaminic, among many others. Experts strongly recommend 
that in any case children<i>not</i> be given any of these remedies unless under 
a physician's direction.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 Precautions when Swimming </strong></p><br>
Swimming can pose 
specific risks for children with current ear infections or previous surgery. 
Water pollutants or chemicals may exacerbate the infection, and underwater 
swimming causes pressure changes that can cause pain. The following precautions 
should be taken: 
<ul> 
<li> Children with ruptured acute otitis media (drainage from ear canal) 
should not go swimming until their infections are completely cured.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Children with AOM that is not ruptured should not dive or swim underwater.
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Children with implanted ear tubes should use earplugs or cotton balls 
coated in petroleum jelly when swimming to prevent infection. </li> </ul> <br>

<br> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHEN AND HOW ARE ANTIBIOTICS OR OTHER DRUGS USED IN ACUTE 
OTITIS MEDIA?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Controversy over the Use of Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media
</strong></p><br>
Antibiotics have been the mainstay treatments of acute otitis 
media. Prescriptions for this condition doubled between 1980 and 1992 from 12 
million to 24 million. In one region of the US more than 70% of children 
received antibiotics before they were seven months old, and the most common 
reason for these medications was otitis media. Of major concern is a worldwide 
increase of common bacterial strains that have become resistant to many 
standard antibiotics. [<i>See Box </i>Warnings on Antibiotic Over-Use and 
Resistant Bacteria.]<br>
<br>
 Many American physicians feel pressured by 
patients and families into prescribing antibiotics when the patients do not 
really need them. Data indicate, however, that far fewer children diagnosed 
with acute otitis media and prescribed antibiotics actually need them: 
<ul> 
<li> One Dutch study reported that only one in seven children under two years 
old with a first episode of acute otitis media derived significant benefits 
from antibiotic treatment. In the study, although antibiotics reduced fever 
faster in the children, it did not reduce the duration of pain or crying.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> A review of 27 studies found that antibiotics benefited only 11% of 
children with otitis media and 17% of those with otitis media with effusion.<br>
<br> </li> 
<li> According to a major 2000 analysis, about two-thirds of children with 
uncomplicated ear infections recover in a day. And, 80% of children are cured 
within a week without antibiotics. (Antibiotics cure up to 95% of infections 
during the first week.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In many Northern European countries, the antibiotic prescription rate for 
ear infection is much lower than in the US, and reports indicate that children 
with ear infections there do as well as their American counterparts. </li> </ul>
One study conducted in the Netherlands, where fewer antibiotics are prescribed, 
did find a higher rate of mastoiditis (3.8/100,000 people per year) compared to 
the rate in many countries with high-prescription rates (1.2 to 2.0/100 000). 
(Mastoiditis, a bone infection in the skull, is a serious complication of 
otitis media.) However, the incidence of this complication was still very small 
in the Netherlands. Furthermore, in Norway and Denmark (where prescription 
rates are<i>high</i>) the incidence of mastoiditis was nearly the same as in 
the Netherlands. 
<p><strong><br>
 Recommendations for Choosing Antibiotics for Acute Otitis 
Media</strong></p><br>
Unfortunately, there are no objective tests available to 
determine specifically which children with acute otitis media would benefit 
from antibiotics and which would not. Older children seem to do better without 
them than younger ones. Some experts recommend the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Parents should monitor the child for three days, using mild pain 
relievers and home remedies. (One physician expert said that he prescribes 
antibiotics during that time only if the child is in obvious, severe pain and 
the eardrum is red and bulging.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If symptoms resolve, no antibiotics are necessary. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If symptoms persist, antibiotics should be taken. </li> </ul> One British 
study reported that only 24% of children who followed these guidelines needed 
antibiotics. And, compared to other groups who were all given immediate 
antibiotics, there were no differences in missed school days or child distress. 
The antibiotic group also had much higher rates of diarrhea. Unfortunately, 
given even a remote possibility of serious complications, including mastoiditis 
and negative effects on learning from hearing loss due to recurrent infections, 
most physicians and parents are very reluctant to abandon the standard use of 
antibiotics.<br>
<br>
 Still many experts believe that ear infections in 
children are overdiagnosed and overtreated with antibiotics.<i>The bottom line 
is that parents should question their physician closely if they recommend 
antibiotics and feel comfortable if antibiotics are not diagnosed.</i> 
<p><strong><br>
 Antibiotic Courses for Single-Episodes of AOM </strong></p>
<br> A number of antibiotics are available for treating ear infections. [ <i>
See Box</i>Antibiotic Choices for Treating Otitis Media.]<b> </b><br>
<br>
 If 
a child needs antibiotics the following are some recommendations for duration 
of regimens. 
<ul> 
<li> A full ten to fourteen day course of antibiotics is typically used for 
very young children and for those with complications such as a perforated ear 
drum, facial abnormalities, or impaired immune systems.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> An oral antibiotic may be given for five to seven days in children over 
two years old who start to improve within 72 hours and who have no risk factors 
for complications.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Parents should be sure their child completes the drug regimen. Not 
completing it is a major factor in the growth of bacterial strains that are 
resistant to antibiotics. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Effectiveness and Follow up Procedures </strong></p><br>

Earaches usually resolve within 8 to 24 hours after taking an antibiotic, 
although about 10% of children who are treated do not respond. Failure may be 
due to the following or other causes: 
<ul> 
<li> In many cases in which the response to an antibiotic is incomplete, a 
virus is often present.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In other cases, the bacteria may be resistant to the antibiotic. </li> 
</ul> In some children, fluid will remain in the middle ear for weeks or 
months, even after the infection has resolved. During that period, children may 
have some hearing problems, but eventually the fluid almost always drains away.
<br> <br>
 Follow-up may involve the following steps: 
<ul> 
<li> If the infection clears up with a single regimen in children less than 15 
months old or in children with risk factors for reinfection, an examination 
should be scheduled two to three weeks after therapy.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If the infection clears up with a single regimen in older children with 
no specific risk factors, they should be reexamined three to six weeks after 
treatment.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If signs of infection are still present (eg, pus is still present in the 
ear) within 48 hours of taking the last antibiotic dose, the child should be 
re-examined. (Parents are excellent judges of whether their child's condition 
has cleared up.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In cases where complications are suspected, an ear, nose, and throat 
specialist (an otolaryngologist) may perform a tympanocentesis or myringotomy, 
procedures in which fluid is drawn from the ear and examined for specific 
organisms. But this is reserved for severe cases and is usually preformed by a 
specialist. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Treatment of Persistent or Recurrent Acute Otitis Media 
</strong></p><br>
For persistent or recurrent acute otitis media a number of 
options are available. 
<ul> 
<li> Watchful waiting. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Second-line and other powerful antibiotics. [ <i>See Box </i> Antibiotic 
Choices for Treating Otitis Media.]<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Tympanostomy. This is a surgical procedure that implants tubes to drain 
fluid and prevent build-up and infection [<i>see</i> What Are the Surgical 
Procedures for Ear Infections?]. </li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 ANTIBIOTIC CHOICES FOR TREATING ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA </strong>
</p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Standard Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media (AOM) </strong>
</p><br>
While many different antibiotics may be used to effectively treat 
otitis media, the physician needs to balance effectiveness, safety, and 
convenience, as well as try to minimize the emergence of resistance. To this 
end the CDC has made very clear recommendations about first and second line 
treatments<br>
<br>
<i>First Line of Therapy. </i>. Of note, about 15% of the 
bacteria that cause ear infections are now believed to be resistant to the 
first-choice antibiotics. This means that only about half of children will 
respond to a given antibiotic. 
<ul> 
<li> The most widely prescribed antibiotic for acute otitis media is 
amoxicillin (Amoxil, Polymox, Trimox, Wymox, or any generic formulation). This 
oral penicillin is both inexpensive and highly effective against the<i>S. 
pneumoniae bacteria.</i> Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to amoxicillin has 
increased significantly. A 2000 study, in fact, reported that 24% of<i> S. 
pneumonia</i> strains in the US were resistant to penicillin. And resistant 
infections reached 32% in children under five. Amoxicillin is also not as 
effective against<i> H. influenzae </i>. In areas where bacterial-resistance to 
antibiotics is high, some physicians recommend high-dose amoxicillin.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Ofloxacin (Floxin), an antibiotic available in ear drops is now 
recommended as first-line therapy for children with AOM who also have 
perforated ear drums or implanted tympanostomy tubes. Ofloxacin is known as a 
fluoroquinolone (also simply called quinolone) and is proving to be very 
effective and safe for these children. (It should be noted that drops are 
effective<i>only</i> in these cases.) Another quinolone, ciprofloxacin, is also 
available in eardrop form outside the US. </li> </ul> <i>Second-Line Therapy. 
</i> If treatment fails after 72 hours, for recurrent or persistent acute 
otitis media, or if the patient has had other antibiotics within the past month 
then the following are recommended: 
<ul> 
<li> Amoxicillin/clavulanate combination (Augmentin). This agent is known as 
an augmented penicillin, which works against a wide spectrum of bacteria.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Certain second- or third-generation oral cephalosporin antibiotics may 
also be good second-line options. Of these Cefuroxime (Ceftin) and cefpodoxime 
(Vantin) has the best record to date among the cephalosporins for coverage 
against bacteria that infect the upper respiratory tract. (Their safety and 
effectiveness in infants under six months old are not proven.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Ceftriaxone (Rocephin), an injectable cephalosporin, is also an option. 
Administering it in a single injection may be sufficient for some children, 
although a 2001 study reported that a three-day regimen was more effective for 
children with non-responsive otitis media. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Antibiotics for Other Circumstances </strong></p><br>
More 
powerful and expensive antibiotics are available for other circumstances, 
including the following: 
<ul> 
<li> For children who are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, of both. 
(These antibiotics belong to a class beta lactam antibiotics. A person who is 
allergic to penicillin has a 5% to 14% chance of being allergic to a 
cephalosporin.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> For children who do not respond to these agents other options are 
available For children with persistent or recurrent episodes of acute otitis 
media. </li> </ul> These antibiotics are usually very expensive, however, and 
are not commonly used. They include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra) or a combination 
of erythromycin and sulfisoxazole (Eryzole, Pediazole) are useful for people 
allergic to penicillin. It should not be used in patients whose infections 
occurred after dental work or in patients allergic to sulfa drugs. Allergic 
reactions can be very serious. Bacterial resistance to these agents has 
increased dramatically, however, and failure rates are high in certain regions. 
An oral solution (Primsol) uses trimethoprim alone. It poses less risk for an 
allergic reaction than the combination and yet is still effective.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Macrolides are other agents sometimes used as an alternative. They 
include erythromycin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), and 
roxithromycin (Rulid). These antibiotics are effective against<i>S. pneumoniae 
</i> and <i>M catarrhalis </i>, but there is increasing bacterial resistance to 
these agents. They are not effective against<i>H. influenzae </i>. Azithromycin 
only needs to be taken for five days. Shorter regimens are being investigated. 
In one study comparing Zithromax to Augmentin, the five day regimen of 
azithromycin (Zithromax) was less effective than Augmentin. In another study, 
however, a one dose regimen was as effective as Augmentin. More research is 
needed. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Side Effects of Antibiotics </strong></p><br>

<ul> 
<li> The most common side effects of nearly all antibiotics are 
gastrointestinal problems, including cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br>
<br> </li> 
<li> Allergic reactions can also occur with all antibiotics but are most 
common with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa. These reactions can 
range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe, even life-threatening 
anaphylactic shock.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some drugs, including certain over-the-counter medications, interact with 
antibiotics; patients should report to the physician all medications they are 
taking. </li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 Warnings on Antibiotic Over-Use and Resistant Bacteria 
</strong></p><br>
<i>Over-prescription of Antibiotics for Colds and Flus. </i>
Each year in the United States, 160 million prescriptions are written for 
antibiotics, equal to about 25,000 tons of these drugs. About half are used for 
patients and half animal, fish, and other agricultural uses.<br>
<br>
 
Virtually no antibiotics for colds are necessary, even with persistent cough 
and thick, green mucus, unless there is evidence of an accompanying infection. 
In one disturbing study, antibiotics were prescribed for nearly half of 
children who went to the doctor for a common cold. And experts estimate that, 
outside the hospital setting, only half of the antibiotics currently being 
prescribed for sore throat and 20% of prescriptions for persistent coughing are 
necessary.<br>
<br>
 Antibiotics may be required for upper respiratory tract 
infections only under certain situations, such as the following: 
<ul> 
<li> In patients, particularly small children or the elderly, who have medical 
conditions that put them at high risk for complications from such infections.
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> In strep throat (which is caused by the <i>Streptococcal</i> bacteria). 
(Strep throat makes up only about 12% of all sore throat cases.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In some cases of an accompanying sinusitis, ear, or other bacterial 
infection. [See the<i></i> Reports <i>Ear Infections (Otitis Media) in Children 
</i> and <i>Sinusitis.</i>] </li> </ul> <i>Resistant Bacterial. </i> 
Prescribing antibiotics to so many people who do not require antibiotics is 
raising great concern among health professionals because of emerging strains of 
bacteria that are no longer eliminated using many standard antibiotics. 
Although new powerful antibiotics continue to be designed, they are expensive 
and are also prone to resistance eventually.<br>
<br>
<i>High-Risk Areas. </i>
The prevalence of such antibiotic-resistant bacteria has dramatically increased 
worldwide. A 2000 study reported that 24% of<i>Streptococcus pneumoniae strains 
</i>are resistant to penicillin in the US. In general, regions and institutions 
with the highest rate of resistance are those in which antibiotics are heavily 
prescribed. In America, for instance, Georgia and Tennessee have the highest 
resistance to penicillin. 1 <br>
<br>
<i>At-Risk Patients. </i>As of yet, the 
average person is not endangered by this problem. Patients at greater risk for 
developing an infection resistant to common antibiotics are those with 
following conditions: 
<ul> 
<li> Being very old or very young. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Being exposed to patients with drug-resistant infection. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Hospitalization in intensive care. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Having had an invasive procedure. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Having had a hospital stay. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Having had prior and prolonged antibiotic therapy, particularly within 
the past four to six weeks.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The presence of a wound. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Having intravenous lines, catheters, or tubes down the throat. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Being immunosuppressed. </li> </ul> <i>Positive News. </i>There are some 
signs of hope:<br>
<br>
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
is reporting a decline in antibiotic prescriptions since the early 1990s. And, 
countries that have reduced their dependence on penicillin are reporting a 
parallel decline in bacteria resistant to the antibiotic.<br>
<br>
 Innovative 
approaches are being investigated. One involves creating antibiotics that have 
the capacity to either self-destruct or regenerate themselves.<br>
<br>
 
Greater emphasis is being placed on development of vaccines and expanding 
immunization programs to prevent infections in the first place.<br>
<br>
<i>
What Patients and Parents Can Do.</i> 
<ul> 
<li> For colds and mild flu, use remedies to relieve symptoms. Realize that 
antibiotics will not shorten the course of a viral infection.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Don't pressure a physicians into prescribing an antibiotic if it is 
clearly inappropriate. The physician very often will give in. It is important 
for patients and parents to understand that although antibiotics may bring a 
sense of security, they provide no significant benefit for a person with viral 
infection, and overuse can contribute to the growing problem of resistant 
bacteria.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If an antibiotic is prescribed, take the full course. </li> </ul> <br>

<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR TREATING OTITIS MEDIA WITH 
EFFUSION (OME)</strong></p><br>
Expert guidelines for children ages one to 
three with otitis media with effusion (OME) are the following: 
<p><strong><br>
 Watchful Waiting during the First Three Months </strong></p>
<br> The child is typically monitored for the first three months and not given 
an antibiotic. Some studies have reported that OME resolved without any 
treatment during this period in the following: 
<ul> 
<li> About two thirds of all children whose OME developed without a previous 
ear infection.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In 90% of children whose OME had immediately followed an episode of acute 
otitis media. </li> </ul> Drugs that thin the mucus, known as mucolytics, may 
have some benefit. Some of these agents contain guaifenesin and are commonly 
available (Robitussin, Scot-Tussin Expectorant). More research is needed to 
confirm whether they are helpful for OME. 
<p><strong><br>
 Antibiotics at the End of Three Months </strong></p><br>

Antibiotics (usually given for 14 to 21 days) are prescribed after or during 
the three months under the following circumstances: 
<ul> 
<li> The condition persists after three months. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The child is suffering. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Hearing loss occurs. (A hearing test should be conducted if the condition 
persists for over three months, whether antibiotics have been given or not.) 
</li> </ul> [<i>See Box </i> Antibiotic Choices for Treating Otitis Media.]<b> 
</b> 
<p><strong><br>
 Treatment Failure at Six Weeks </strong></p><br>
If OME 
persists for six weeks in spite of antibiotic therapies, the following options 
may be considered: 
<ul> 
<li> Antibiotics are continued and stopped when the condition has cleared. <br>
<br> </li> 
<li> Antibiotics are continued long-term even after the condition has cleared 
in high-risk children to prevent a recurrence of OME. (A number of studies 
indicate that antibiotic treatment is not very effective in preventing relapse, 
however. In fact, one study found no difference at all in persistent OME 
between treated and untreated children, and some experts believe that 
antibiotics are not useful at all for this condition.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A combination of corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) and 
antibiotics may be more effective than antibiotics alone. The steroid's 
contribution is to reduce inflammation, which may improve fluid clearance in 
the middle ear. Corticosteroids have no effect on infection and, in fact, 
suppress the immune system, so antibiotics are also used. At this time expert 
groups still do not recommend oral corticosteroids at all for OME because of 
potentially severe side effects. They can be particularly dangerous for 
children who have not yet had chicken pox, particularly if they have been 
exposed within the month.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Surgery (tube insertion) is usually recommended if OME is still present 
and there is evidence of hearing loss of over 20 decibels. As with antibiotics, 
however, some experts believe it is overused for otitis media. [<i>See </i>What 
Are the Surgical Procedures for Ear Infections?] </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR EAR INFECTIONS?</strong>
</p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Myringotomy and Standard Tympanostomy </strong></p><br>
<i>
General Guidelines.</i>Surgery to drain the ear drum ( <i>myringotomy</i>) with 
or without implanted ventilation tubes to drain the fluid (<i>tympanostomy</i>) 
is the basic surgical procedure for otitis media. It is the second most 
frequently performed procedure for children under two (circumcision is first). 
In 1996 tubes were placed in the ears of one out of every 110 American 
children. And, an estimated 280,000 children younger than three years of age 
underwent the operation. It is usually performed in children with recurrent 
acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion (OME) under they following 
circumstances: 
<ul> 
<li> They have not responded to aggressive antibiotic treatment or antibiotic 
treatment is not warranted.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> They have evidence of fluid in the ear for more than four months and have 
experienced hearing difficulties. </li> </ul> <i>Controversies Concerning 
Surgery.</i>Surgery is as controversial as antibiotic treatment, however. <br>

<br> Arguments supporting tubal procedures are based on the following 
observations, among others: 
<ul> 
<li> Hearing is almost always restored following tympanostomy. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> One 2000 study indicated that the operation significantly improves many 
aspects of a child's quality of life, including emotional distress, impaired 
hearing and speech, and limitations in activity. </li> </ul> The following are 
studies suggesting that surgery offers few benefits for many children on whom 
it is performed: 
<ul> 
<li> A 1994 study indicated that a quarter of all tube insertion procedures 
was not appropriate, and in 30% of procedures the risks were as great as the 
benefits. The study was done, however, to assess medical procedures for 
insurance reimbursement and a number of surgeons have questioned it.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Important studies in 2000 and 2001 suggested that the procedures in very 
young children (one and two years old) who had persistent otitis media offered 
no advantages for language development by the time the child reached the age of 
three. </li> </ul> <i>Myringotomy. </i>Myringotomy is used to drain the fluid. 
It may be used as a single procedure in unresponsive acute otitis media or used 
in combination with tympanostomy. It involves the following steps. 
<ul> 
<li> The surgeon makes a very small incision in the eardrum. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Fluid is sucked out using a vacuum-like device. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The fluid is usually examined for identifying specific bacteria <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> The eardrum heals in about a week. </li> </ul> <i>Myringotomy and 
Tympanostomy.</i>If otitis media with effusion persists in spite of drug 
therapy or if it is caused by structural or inborn problems, a tympanostomy is 
also performed. It involves the following: 
<ul> 
<li> A general anesthetic is required but children typically recover 
completely within a few hours.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Myringotomy is performed. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> After myringotomy, the physician inserts a tube to allow continuous 
drainage of the fluid from the middle ear.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is a simple procedure, and the child almost never has to spend the 
night in the hospital.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some children report almost no discomfort after surgery and find 
acetaminophen (Tylenol) sufficient for any pain. About half of children, 
however, require codeine or more powerful pain relievers. One study found that 
lidocaine eardrops were effective in relieving pain and stress after the 
procedure. </li> </ul> <i>Complications. </i>Complications of the operation are 
very uncommon: 
<ul> 
<li> General anesthetic poses risks, although rare, for allergic reactions or 
other side effects.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Persistent ear drum perforation is the most common serious complication, 
but it too is rare.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Scarring can also occur, particularly in children who require more than 
one procedure, but it almost never affects hearing.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Small keratin (skin cell) containing cysts called cholesteatomas develop 
around the tube site in over 1% of patients. This raises some concern about the 
long-term safety of the procedure, although other studies have indicated that 
this complication is rare. More studies are needed.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Sometimes the tubes become blocked from sticky secretions or clotted 
blood after the operation. If the secretions are purulent (pus-filled) from 
infection, treatment with antibiotic ear drops, such as ofloxacin or 
ciprofloxacin, may be very effective. </li> </ul> <i>Success Rates. </i> 
Hearing is almost always restored following tympanostomy. Failure to achieve 
normal or near-normal hearing is usually due to complicated conditions, such as 
preexisting ear problems or persistent OME in children who have had previous 
multiple tympanostomies. In one ten year study, hearing loss was still present 
in 12.5% of people who had had surgery, although in half of these individuals, 
hearing loss was very mild (loss was below 20 decibels). Persistent fluid was 
the main reason for continued impaired hearing. Only 1.9% of hearing loss cases 
could be attributed to complications of the operation itself.<br>
<br>
<i>
Precautions.</i>While the tubes are in place, children may take the following 
precautions: 
<ul> 
<li> Many doctors feel that children should use earplugs when swimming as long 
as the tubes are in place in order to prevent infection. (Cotton balls coated 
with petroleum jelly are effective alternatives to ear plugs.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Children may shower without earplugs. </li> </ul> Some physicians feel 
that as long as the child does not dive or swim underwater, earplugs may not be 
necessary, but parents should consult their own child's doctor on this subject.
<br> <br>
<i>Follow-Up. </i>After surgery, the children may experience the 
following course. 
<ul> 
<li> Eventually, the tubes fall out as the hole in the eardrum closes. This 
may happen between several months to over a year. This is painless and the 
patient and parents may not even be aware that the tubes are out.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The operation may need to be repeated, occasionally several times, if, 
after the tubes fall out, the effusion and hearing loss still persist.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Antibiotics are often prescribed after surgery to prevent such recurrence.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Laser Tympanostomy </strong></p><br>
A new tympanostomy 
technique uses a laser, which creates a tiny hole and allows the fluid to drain 
immediately. No tubes are inserted and the child does not need general 
anesthesia. One 1999 study reported that within one week of laser-assisted 
surgery, 100% of children with acute otitis media were symptom free. After 
three months, only 8% had repeat infections (compared to an average of 47% when 
treated with antibiotics). Of those children with OME, 65% were fluid-free 
after three months. 
<p><strong><br>
 Adenoidectomy</strong></p><br>
Adenoids are collections of 
spongy lymph tissue in the back of the throat. Removal of the adenoids, called 
adenoidectomy, is sometimes considered if they are overly enlarged and 
interfere with Eustachian tube function. In such cases, the procedure might 
follow myringotomy and tympanostomy. Removing tonsils at the same time as 
adenoids (<i>adenotonsillectomy</i>) does not appear to add any value to the 
procedure, and it increases the chance of bleeding (which ranges from 0.5% to 
4%). One 2001 study did report that either adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy 
at the time of tympanostomy substantially reduced hospitalizations related to 
otitis media among children two years of age or older. It is commonly held, 
however, that, except for special circumstances, adenoidectomy should not be 
conducted on children under four. More research is needed to confirm any 
benefits in this group. 
<p><strong><br>
 Functional Jaw Orthopedics </strong></p><br>
Functional jaw 
orthopedics are experimental dental treatments that use appliances to stimulate 
muscles in the tongue, lips, and cheek. The devices are not supported by the 
teeth, but directly by the soft tissues in the mouth in order to make changes 
in bone and teeth. Some experts hope that this experimental approach may 
benefit a number of conditions now treated medically, including otitis media.
<br> <br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTING RECURRENT ACUTE OTITIS 
MEDIA</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Antibiotics</strong></p><br>
Antibiotics have been used for 
prevention of acute otitis media in children under the following circumstances: 
<ul> 
<li> If the child has had three or more separate ear infections every six 
months.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If the child has had four or more ear infections within a year. </li> 
</ul> Almost all physicians are moving away from this practice, however, 
because of concerns about resistance and questions on their value. The 
following are some observations on this issue: 
<ul> 
<li> Most recurring ear infections stop completely in children older than 16 
months whether or not they were given preventive antibiotics. For this reason, 
some experts recommend that preventive therapy is not warranted at all in 
children over 16 months.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Although one large study reported that preventive antibiotics decreased 
the<i>frequency</i> of new episodes of acute otitis media by 44%, some experts 
believe that this figure does not represent a significant drop in the<i>actual
</i> <i>number</i> of episodes. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> One study reported that amoxicillin was no more effective in preventing 
recurrent ear infections than a placebo (so-called sugar pills).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In Finland, where very few children are treated with antibiotics for 
otitis media, a long term study found that after an initial diagnosis of 
recurrent acute otitis media, only 12% had three or more episodes afterward and 
only 4% developed otitis media with effusion. All the other children had only 
two or less attacks after the diagnosis. </li> </ul> <i>Specific Antibiotic 
Choices.</i>When preventive antibiotics are prescribed, the following may be 
used: 
<ul> 
<li> One or two daily doses of amoxicillin or sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin). <br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Azithromycin (Zithromax) may be an effective alternative for children who 
are allergic to penicillin, who live in regions with high rates of bacteria 
resistant to penicillin, or who have family conditions in which complying to a 
daily regimen is difficult. A single weekly dose may be sufficient. </li> </ul> 
<i>Timing and Duration. </i>Physician opinion varies as to the best timing and 
duration for taking preventive antibiotics. The following are some options: 
<ul> 
<li> Prescribed for a consistent three- to six-month period following the last 
acute episode.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Prescribed only in winter and spring when the risk for respiratory 
infections is high. </li> </ul> Prescribed at the onset of any respiratory 
infection. 
<p><strong><br>
 Vaccines</strong></p><br>
Children who are susceptible to 
recurrent ear infections should probably be given vaccinations against 
influenza viruses and pneumococci.<br>
<br>
<i>Viral Influenza Vaccines. </i>
Vaccines are designed to recognize foreign agents (called antigens) in the body 
and to attack them. Vaccines against influenza currently employ inactivated 
(not live) viruses to produce an immune response that will then attack the 
active virus. Vaccines are given by injection in the fall, usually between 
October and December. A live but weakened intranasal vaccine (FluMist) should 
be available soon. It is engineered to grow only in the cooler temperatures of 
the nasal passages, not in the warmer lungs and lower airways. The vaccine 
boosts the specific immune factors in the mucous membranes of the nose that 
fight off the actual viral infections. It is employed using a nasal spray and 
in one study provided protection against the flu in up to 93% of children.<br>

<br> The following children over six months should be vaccinated <b>(note: 
vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks 
largely exceed any benefits. SeeSPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines. Please review all 
the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your 
children.)</b> against influenza: 
<ul> 
<li> Any child with a condition that requires regular medical care. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Any child who has been hospitalized for a serious illness (particularly 
lung, kidney, diabetes, sickle-cell, or immune deficiencies.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Children who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy should also be 
immunized against the flu because they are at higher risk for Reye's syndrome, 
a life-threatening disease, if they get the flu. </li> </ul> Possible negative 
responses include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Newer vaccines contain very little egg protein, but an allergic reaction 
still may occur in people with strong allergies to eggs.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Almost a third of people who receive the influenza vaccine develop 
redness or soreness at the injection site for one or two days afterward.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Other side effects include mild fatigue and muscle aches and pains; they 
tend to occur between six and 12 hours after the vaccination and last up to two 
days. It should be noted that these symptoms are not influenza itself but an 
immune response to the virus proteins in the vaccine. Anyone with a fever, 
however, should not be vaccinated<b>(note: vaccines can cause irreversible 
health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See
SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines. Please review all the evidence on vaccines before 
deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.)</b> until the ailment has 
subsided.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some studies have reported more severe asthma symptoms in children with 
the lung condition. A 2000 study of asthmatic children, however, reported no 
increased risk. In fact, there was some indication that the vaccination helped
<i>reduce</i> asthma attacks over time. More research is needed to confirm or 
refute these results. </li> </ul> <i>Pneumococcal Vaccines. </i>A recently 
approved pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar or PCV7) could potentially prevent over 
a million cases of ear infections each year as well as serious infections, such 
as pneumonia, in American children. The vaccine is now recommended for all 
children up to age two and certain high-risk children up to age five, such as 
those at risk for meningitis or widespread infection. It should be noted that 
protection is not 100%, but the vaccine is still effective in many children. 
Protection lasts for over six years in most people. In one study, a similar 
vaccine under investigation protected not only children in day care from 
serious respiratory infections, but their younger unvaccinated<b>(note: 
vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks 
largely exceed any benefits. SeeSPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines. Please review all 
the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your 
children.)</b> siblings had fewer infections as well. 
<p><strong><br>
 Experimental Agents </strong></p><br>
<i>Interfering Bacteria.
</i> Researchers have observed that the noses and throats of children who are 
prone to ear infections harbor smaller numbers of the &quot;friendly&quot; 
bacteria that help prevent overproduction of the harmful bacteria, than 
children without frequent infection. An interesting study in Sweden employed a 
nasal spray containing harmless bacteria called alpha-streptococcal, which are 
normally found in the throat and competes for space with harmful bacteria. In 
the study, the bacteria helped to protect against recurrent otitis media in 
susceptible children. This is very promising because it could significantly 
reduce antibiotic use; more research is warranted.<br>
<br>
<i>Antiviral Agents.
</i>In one study, when the anti-viral drug, zanamivir (Relenza), was 
administered in the nasal passages of adults with influenza, middle-ear 
abnormalities were reduced from 73% to 32%. This drug is available for children 
greater than seven years old for treatment of influenza, but no research has 
determined it value for preventing or treating otitis media in children.<br>

<br> <i>Xylitol. </i>Studies are reporting that children who chew gum or 
swallow a syrup containing xylitol, a sugar alcohol, experience significantly 
fewer ear infections. Chewing gum was more effective than the syrup. Xylitol is 
produced naturally in birch, strawberries, and raspberries. It has properties 
that fight<i>Streptococcal pneumonia </i>bacteria. Although in one study, 
xylitol did not reduce bacteria in the nose and throat, it did prevent ear 
infection. Some health providers report that even children one and a half years 
old can learn to chew and not swallow gum. The gum is not widely available in 
the US, however, and studies have not tested children between six and 18 
months, the highest-risk age group for otitis media. This is an area for 
further research.<br>
