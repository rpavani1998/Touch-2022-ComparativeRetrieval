<h1>Children &amp; Infants</h1> 
<p>Children are at higher risk for the flu because their immune systems are 
not fully developed. Children withchronic health conditions are at even higher 
risk of getting the flu and experiencing complications.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Children 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine.</li> 
<li>Children younger than 6 months cannot get the flu vaccine. Get vaccinated 
yourself and follow ourprevention tips to keep them healthy.</li> 
<li>Parents and caregivers of children younger than 5 or with chronic health 
conditions should get the flu vaccine.</li> 
<li>If your child is younger than 5 or has any chronic health conditions and 
experiencesflu-like symptoms contact a health care provider as soon as possible.
</li> </ul> 
<h2>Why are children at higher risk for getting the flu?</h2> 
<p>Children are more likely to get the flu or have flu-related complications 
because their immune systems are still developing.&Acirc;&nbsp; Each year in 
the U.S. an average of<strong>20,000 children under the age of 5 are 
hospitalized for flu-related complications</strong>. Severe flu-related 
complications are most common in children younger than 2 Young children, 6 
months to 5 years, are at risk offebrile seizures. Children with chronic health 
conditions such as asthma and diabetes have an extremely high risk of 
developing seriousflu-related complications.</p>

</p> 
<p>Vaccination is the best protection against the flu. Everyone 6 months of 
age and older should get the vaccine as soon as it becomes available. Children 
6 months to 8 years of age who have never gotten a flu vaccination should get 
two doses of this season&rsquo;s vaccine. Vaccination is especially important 
for children:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Between 6 months and 5 years old</li> 
<li>With a chronic health condition like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease
</li> </ul> 
<p>If you need help paying for your child&rsquo;s flu vaccine, the Vaccines 
for Children program can provide assistance.</p> 
<p>Because children are at an increased risk of getting pneumonia, a 
complication of the flu, talk to a health care provider about thepneumococcal 
vaccine. The pneumococcal vaccine will protect your child against pneumonia.</p>
<p>In addition, follow our every day steps to keep your family healthy this 
flu season.</p> 
<h2>My child is younger than 6 months, what can I do to protect him or her 
from the flu?</h2> 
<p>The flu vaccine is <strong>not</strong> approved for infants younger than 6 
months. Infants younger than 6 months are, however, at especially high risk of 
flu-related complications. The best way to protect your child is to follow our
prevention guidelines and have caregivers and household members get the flu 
vaccine.</p> 
<h3>How Can I Protect My Newborn From the Flu?</h3> 
<p><em>Babies under 6 months of age should not get the flu shot. Family 
members and caregivers should vaccinate themselves to protect the baby.</em></p>
<h2>My child has the flu, how do I care for him or her?</h2> 
<p>If your child has flu-like symptoms and he or she is younger than 5 years 
old or has any chronic medical conditions, contact a health care provider as 
soon as possible. Your child&rsquo;s provider may want to prescribeantiviral 
medications to make your child&rsquo;s symptoms less severe and help him or her 
feel better faster.</p> 
<p>Follow these special instructions, in addition to the recommendations in 
Caring for Someone with the Flu, when caring for children and infants with the 
flu:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not give aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) to children or teenagers who 
have the flu. Giving aspirin to children with the flu can cause a rare but 
serious illness calledReye&rsquo;s syndrome. Read ingredient labels on 
over-the-counter medications carefully to ensure they do not contain aspirin.
</li> 
<li>To safely treat children under 2, use a suction bulb to help clear mucus 
and a cool-mist humidifier to make breathing easier.</li> 
<li>Do not give children younger than 4 over-the-counter cold medicines 
without consulting a health care provider.</li> 
<li>Give children and teens 5 years and older cold medicines with 
acetaminophen (Tylenol&reg;) or ibuprofen (Advil&reg;, Motrin&reg;, 
Nuprin&reg;), to relieve symptoms.</li> </ul> 
<h2>When should I seek emergency medical assistance?</h2> 
<p>Seek medical attention immediately if your child:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Is breathing fast or having trouble breathing</li> 
<li>Has a bluish skin color</li> 
<li>Is not drinking enough fluids</li> 
<li>Has severe or persistent vomiting</li> 
<li>Is not waking up or interacting</li> 
<li>Is irritable and does not want to be held</li> 
<li>Has flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse 
cough</li> 
<li>Has other health conditions and develops flu symptoms, including a fever 
and/or cough</li> </ul> 
<p>In infants, watch for the signs above as well as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inability to eat</li> 
<li>Trouble breathing</li> 
<li>No tears when crying</li> 
<li>Significantly fewer wet diapers than normal</li> </ul> 
<h2>My child has the flu. When can he or she go to back to school or day care?
</h2> 
<p>Keep your child at home and away from healthy people for at least 24 hours 
after his or her fever is gone. Fever should be gone without the use of a 
fever-reducing medicine.</p> 
<h2>I am breastfeeding and have the flu. Should I continue breastfeeding?</h2> 
<p>If you are breastfeeding you should continue to nurse your baby while being 
treated for the flu. Breast milk passes antibodies from you to your baby. 
Antibodies help fight off infection.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If possible, only adults who are not sick should care for infants, 
including providing feedings.</li> 
<li>If you are too sick to breastfeed, pump and have someone give your milk to 
your baby.</li> 
<li>Be careful not to cough or sneeze in the baby&rsquo;s face. Wash your 
hands often with soap and water.&Acirc;&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<h2>We have pets. How can we keep them healthy?</h2> 
<p>If you and your children are sick with flu-like illness, take the same 
precautions that you would to keep your friends and family healthy. For more
