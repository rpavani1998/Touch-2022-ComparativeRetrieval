<h1>Herpes viruses</h1> Last updated: Monday, August 22, 2011 Print <br>
 
&nbsp;<br>

<p> </p> 
<h2>BACKGROUND</h2> 
<p>Herpes is a group of viruses that infect humans. Types of herpes viruses 
include herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2 respectively), 
human herpesvirus type 3 (varicella-zoster virus), human herpesvirus type 4 
(including Epstein-Barr virus and lymphocryptovirus), human herpesvirus type 5 
(cytomegalovirus), human herpesviruse type 6 (HHV-6, including human B-cell 
lymphotrophic virus and roseolovirus), human herpesvirus type 7 (HHV-7), and 
human herpesvirus type 8 (rhadinovirus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus).
</p> 
<p>The viruses fall into three categories: Alpha herpes viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, 
and varicella-zoster virus), beta herpes viruses (cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and 
HHV-7), and gamma herpes viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, lymphocryptovirus, and 
HHV-8). The viruses are different and cause various conditions with many unique 
signs and symptoms. However, all herpes viruses share some common properties, 
including a pattern of active symptoms followed by latent (inactive) periods 
with no symptoms that can last for months, years, or even for a lifetime. 
Herpes symptoms may even never reappear. The severity of herpes symptoms 
depends on the type of virus with which the individual is infected.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex type 1 (HHV-1) is also known as a cold sore or fever 
blister. Herpes simplex type 2 (HHV-2) is also known as genital herpes. Human 
herpes virus 3 is also referred to as varicella-zoster or VZV. Herpes varicella 
is the primary infection that causes chickenpox, and herpes zoster is the 
reactivation of the varicella virus that causes shingles.</p> 
<p>Herpes 1 and 2 infections are generally marked by painful, watery blisters 
in the skin or mucous membranes (such as the mouth or lips) or on the genitals. 
Lesions heal with a crust-forming scab, the hallmark of herpes. This is 
particularly likely during an outbreak, although individuals may shed virus 
between outbreaks. Although no cure is yet available, antiviral treatments 
exist that reduce the likelihood of viral shedding. An HSV infection on the 
lips, commonly known as a &quot;cold sore&quot; or &quot;fever blister,&quot; 
should not to be confused with a canker sore; canker sores (painful sores on 
the tongue or oral membranes in the mouth) are not caused by the HSV virus.</p> 
<p>Herpes is a contagious infection that spreads when the carrier is producing 
and releasing (&quot;shedding&quot;) virus. Herpes viruses are transmitted from 
human to human in different ways. With HSV-1, contact and infection can occur 
directly from another human (such as mouth-to-mouth, hand-to-mouth contact) or 
through the use of everyday objects that have come in contact with the virus, 
including razors, towels, dishes, and glasses. Genital herpes or HSV-2 can only 
be contracted through direct sexual contact (genital-to-genital, 
mouth-to-genital, or hand-to-genital; not kissing) with an infected partner. 
Occasionally, oral-genital contact can spread oral herpes to the genitals (and 
vice versa). Individuals with active herpes lesions on or around their mouths 
or on their genitals should avoid oral sex. The varicella-zoster (chickenpox) 
virus spreads through the humidity in the air when inhaled and mainly spreads 
during the incubation period, which is just before an outbreak of symptoms.</p> 
<p>After an initial or primary infection, herpes viruses establish a period 
called latency, during which the virus is present in the cell bodies of nerves 
that innervate (attach) to the area of the original viral outbreak (such as 
genitals, mouth, and lips). At some point this latency ends, and the virus 
becomes active again. While active, the virus begins to multiply (called 
shedding), and becomes transmittable again. This shedding may or may not be 
accompanied by symptoms. During reactivation, virus is produced in the nerve 
cell and transported outwardly via the nerve to the skin. The ability of herpes 
virus to become latent and reactive explains the chronic (long-term), recurring 
nature of a herpes infection.</p> 
<p>Recurrence of the viral symptoms is usually milder than the original 
infection. Recurrence may be triggered by menstruation, sun exposure, illness 
with fever, stress, immune system imbalances, and other unknown causes.</p> 
<h2>TYPE OF HERPES</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2):</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV): There are two types of HSV, including herpes 
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). Although some 
symptoms of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar (such as lesions), they are usually 
transmitted differently and involve different areas of the body.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1): Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is 
the cause of herpes labialis (fever blisters, cold sores) and involves the lips 
and inflammation of the gums and mouth. Other conditions caused by HSV-1 
include: oropharyngeal, cutaneous, and ocular lesions, including HSV 
blepharitis, HSV conjunctivitis, HSV keratitis, HSV infectious epithelial 
keratitis, HSV anterior uveitis, HSV retinitis, and HSV neonatal infection.</p> 
<p>HSV-1 is a very common virus. It is thought that 90% of adults have been 
exposed to the virus during a lifetime, and most Americans are infected by the 
age of 20. After the first episode, the virus lies dormant in the nerves or 
skin around the original area until something sets the virus off into another 
eruption. Colds, flu, and even stress can cause an outbreak of cold sores. It 
is not well understood why an individual has an outbreak at one time of life 
and not another. Most people contract oral herpes when they are children by 
receiving a kiss from a friend or relative.</p> 
<p>The first symptoms usually appear within one or two weeks and as late as 
three weeks after contact with an infected person. The lesions of herpes 
labialis usually last for seven to 10 days then begin to resolve. Following the 
active infection, the virus becomes latent (dormant), residing in the nerve 
cells and may reactivate later causing a new outbreak at or near the original 
site.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that HSV-1 is becoming a major cause of genital herpes 
as well due to unprotected sex. In some studies, it is now a more important 
cause than HSV-2</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2): HSV-2 is considered the primary cause 
of genital herpes. According to the Centers for Disease control (CDC), in the 
United States, at least 45 million people ages 12 and older have had herpes 
simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2 or genital herpes) infection. According to 
researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HSV is 
present in as many as one in six teens and adults in the United States.</p> 
<p>HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted disease (STD), meaning an individual must 
engage in sexual activity (oral or manual sex or intercourse) in order to 
transmit or be infected with this virus. HSV-2 infection is more common in 
women (approximately one out of four women) than in men (almost one out of 
five). This may be because male-to-female transmissions are more likely than 
female-to-male transmission. Anyone who is sexually active can contract genital 
herpes. There are no documented cases of a person getting genital herpes from 
an inanimate object such as a toilet seat, bathtub, or towel. Herpes is a very 
fragile virus and does not live long on surfaces outside the body.</p> 
<p>Most individuals infected with HSV-2 are not aware of their infection. 
However, if signs and symptoms occur during the first outbreak, they can be 
quite severe. The first outbreak usually occurs within two weeks after the 
virus is transmitted, and the sores typically heal within two to four weeks. 
Other signs and symptoms during the primary episode may include a second crop 
of sores and flu-like symptoms, including fever and swollen glands. However, 
many individuals with HSV-2 infection may never have sores, or they may have 
very mild sores that they do not even notice or that they mistake for insect 
bites or another skin condition.</p> 
<p>Most people diagnosed with a first episode of genital herpes can expect to 
have four to five outbreaks (called symptomatic recurrences) within a year. 
Over time these recurrences usually decrease in frequency. There is no cure for 
this recurrent (returning) infection, which may cause embarrassment and 
emotional distress. Having genital herpes does not preclude an individual from 
having a normal relationship. If the individual or their partner is infected 
with HSV type 2, steps can be taken to manage the transmission of the virus 
(see Precautions).</p> 
<p>With HSV-2 (genital herpes), transmission of the virus can occur when the 
infected sexual partner does not have an active outbreak. Symptoms of an active 
outbreak include blisters or ulcers. Some individuals may never have any 
symptoms and may not know that they are infected with the herpes virus. 
However, they can still transmit the virus to others.</p> 
<p>Although HSV-2 is widely recognized as a cause of genital herpes, it can 
cause oral herpes as well. Moreover, HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, resulting 
in similar symptoms as infections caused by HSV-2 in the facial area as well as 
genital herpes (similar symptoms in the genital region).</p> 
<p>With genital infections, HSV-2 is more likely to shed than HSV-1, 
especially in women. It is possible that over half of the people infected with 
HSV-2 shed the virus at some time without having any symptoms or rash. It is 
also estimated that one-third of all HSV-2 infections are caused when a 
non-infected person comes in contact with someone who is shedding virus without 
symptoms.</p> 
<p>HSV-2 can be passed in the urine or genital discharge of an infected 
person. The viruses become reactivated secondary to certain stimuli, including 
fever, physical, or emotional stress, ultraviolet light exposure (sunlight or 
tanning beds), and nerve injury.</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 3 (varicella-zoster, or HHV-3):</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 3 (varicella-zoster): Both shingles and chickenpox 
are caused by the human herpesvirus type 3 (HHV-3), or the varicella-zoster 
virus. HHV-3 is still referred as either herpes varicella (the primary 
infection that causes chickenpox) or herpes zoster (the reactivation of the 
virus that causes shingles). The human race is the only known carrier of HHV-3.
</p> 
<p>Chickenpox: Chickenpox is usually a childhood disease. Over 90% of cases 
occur in children aged 14 years and younger. Before widespread vaccination, the 
incidence of chickenpox in the United States. approached the annual birth rate, 
averaging between 3.1-3.8 million cases per year. Chickenpox can occur at any 
time of year.</p> 
<p>Chickenpox is acquired by direct contact with infected blister fluid or by 
inhalation of respiratory droplets. When an individual with chickenpox coughs 
or sneezes, they expel tiny droplets that carry the varicella virus. A person 
who has never been exposed to chickenpox inhales these droplets and the virus 
enters the lungs, and then is carried through the bloodstream to the skin where 
it causes a rash.</p> 
<p>While the virus is in the bloodstream (before the rash begins), it causes 
typical viral symptoms such as fever, fatigue, joint pains, headache, and 
swollen glands. These symptoms usually resolve by the time the rash develops. 
The incubation period (time before the full blown symptoms of the virus appear) 
of chickenpox averages 14 days with a range of nine to 21 days.</p> 
<p>The chickenpox rash usually begins on the trunk of the body and spreads to 
the face and extremities. The chickenpox lesion starts as a two to four 
millimeter red papule that develops an irregular outline (similar to a rose 
petal). A thin-walled, clear vesicle (a blister that looks like a dew drop) 
develops on top of the area of redness. This lesion is very unique to 
chickenpox. After about eight to 12 hours, the fluid in the vesicle gets cloudy 
and the vesicle breaks leaving a crust. The fluid is highly contagious, but 
once the lesion crusts over, it is not considered contagious. The crust usually 
falls off after seven days sometimes leaving a craterlike scar. Although one 
lesion goes through this complete cycle in about seven days, another hallmark 
of chickenpox is the fact that new lesions can crop up every day for several 
days. Therefore, it may take about a week until new lesions stop appearing and 
existing lesions crust over. Children should not be sent back to school until 
all lesions have crusted over.</p> 
<p>The number of chickenpox lesions a person gets varies considerably. The 
usual range is 100-300 lesions. Usually, older children and adults develop more 
lesions than young children. Individuals who have previously traumatized skin, 
such as sunburn or eczema, may also develop more severe lesions.</p> 
<p>In addition to affecting the skin, chickenpox can also cause lesions on the 
mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth, throat, and vagina.</p> 
<p>There is a varicella-zoster vaccine for use in individuals ages 12 months 
through 12 years. The chickenpox vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, meaning 
the live, disease-producing virus was modified or weakened in the laboratory to 
produce an organism that can grow and produce immunity in the body without 
causing illness.</p> 
<p>Shingles: Shingles (also called herpes zoster) is a disease caused by the 
varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After an 
individual develops the VZV, it remains dormant within the nerve roots (nerve 
tissue). Outbreaks are then termed shingles. Shingles affects an estimated two 
in every 10 people in their lifetime. More than 500,000 people in the Unites 
States develop shingles annually. It is most common in individuals over the age 
of 50 and those who have previously had chickenpox. Shingles is also more 
common in individuals with weakened immune systems, which can result from HIV 
infection, radiation treatment, certain medications (including steroids and 
chemotherapy), transplant operations, and high levels of or chronic (long term) 
stress.</p> 
<p>The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain, or sometimes 
numbness or itch, in one particular location on only one side of the body. 
After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters (similar to 
chickenpox) appears in the affected location. Shingles pain can be mild or 
severe. Some individuals experience only itching, while others feel pain from 
gentle touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called 
a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who 
has had chickenpox is at risk for developing shingles at some point in their 
lives.</p> 
<p>There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with antiviral drugs that 
fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain. 
There is a vaccine now available that may prevent shingles or lessen its 
effects (Zostavax&copy;). The vaccine is for people 60 or over who have had 
chickenpox but who have not had shingles.</p> 
<p>Postherpetic neuralgia: Some individuals continue to feel pain long after 
the shingles rash and blisters heal. This condition is termed postherpetic 
neuralgia (PHN). Not everyone who has had a recurrence of the virus develops 
PHN. But postherpetic neuralgia is a common complication of shingles in older 
adults. The primary symptom of PHN is pain that can be debilitating. The pain 
associated with PHN may be aching, throbbing, stabbing, sharp, or piercing. 
Stress may intensify the severity of the pain. The intensity of the pain can 
vary, but pain-free intervals are rare. Some individuals who have had PHN 
describe the pain as the worst pain they have ever felt. The greater the age 
when the virus reactivates, the greater the chance the individual will develop 
PHN. In most individuals, the pain of PHN lessens over time. Treatments for PHN 
that may ease nerve-related pain include: antidepressants (such as 
amitryptilline or Elavil&copy;), anticonvulsants (such as gabapentin or 
Neurontin&copy;), steroids (such as prednisone or Deltasone&copy;), pain 
killers (such as opiates including oxycodone or Percocet&copy;), and topical 
anesthetic patches (such as lidocaine or Lidoderm&copy;).</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 4 (HHV-4):</p> 
<p>Epstein barr virus (EBV): Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus (human 
herpesvirus type 4) that causes a viral syndrome referred to as mononucleosis. 
EBV has also been found to play a role in the development of Burkitt's lymphoma 
(a rare form of lymphoma or cancer of the lymph system) and nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (cancer of the nose and throat) in humans. The Epstein-Barr viral 
syndrome, Mononucleosis (also known as, mono, kissing disease, and Epstein-Barr 
viral syndrome), causes fever, a sore throat, swollen lymph glands- especially 
in the neck, and extreme fatigue or tiredness. Although typically caused by the 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mononucleosis can also be caused by other herpes 
viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV). In the United States, as many as 95% 
of adults between 35-40 years of age have been infected with EBV. Infants 
become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal protection present at birth 
disappears. Infection with EBV during adolescence or young adulthood results in 
mononucleosis in 35-50% of the cases. The incubation period for the 
mononucleosis is usually seven to 14 days in children and adolescents. The 
incubation period in adults is longer; at times it may be 30-50 days. If 
symptoms of mononucleosis last more than six months, it is frequently referred 
to as chronic EBV infection. EBV may be linked to chronic fatigue syndrome, a 
condition of chronic tiredness and exhaustion.</p> 
<p>Mononucleosis spreads by contact with moisture from the mouth and throat of 
a person who is infected with the virus. Kissing, sharing drinking glasses, 
eating utensils, and toothbrushes, or touching anything that has been near the 
mouth of an infected person, may result in transmission of the disease. The 
infection develops slowly with such mild symptoms initially that it may be 
mistaken for a cold or the flu. As the condition progresses, the symptoms may 
include a sore throat that lasts two weeks or more, swollen lymph nodes (in the 
neck, armpits, and groin), a persistent fever, fatigue (tiredness), and malaise 
(a vague feeling of discomfort). These symptoms can be mild or so severe that 
throat pain impedes swallowing and fever reaches 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Some 
people also experience a rash, eye pain, photophobia (discomfort with bright 
light), and a swollen spleen or liver. In most cases of mononucleosis, no 
specific treatment is necessary as the illness is usually self-limiting. 
Although the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis usually resolve in one or two 
months, the EBV remains dormant in cells in the throat and blood for the rest 
of the person's life. Periodically, the virus can reactivate and can be found 
in the saliva of infected persons. This reactivation usually occurs without 
symptoms of illness, although it may be linked to symptoms of CFS. EBV also 
establishes a lifelong dormant infection in some cells of the body's immune 
system.</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 5 (HHV-5):</p> 
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV): The cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes virus (human 
herpesvirus type 5) found in body fluids including urine, saliva (spit), breast 
milk, blood, tears, semen, and vaginal fluids. It is commonly transmitted from 
an infected pregnant woman to her unborn child. It is an opportunistic virus 
that does not usually cause disease in those with healthy immune systems. In 
people with weakened immune systems (such as those with HIV or AIDS), CMV can 
cause any number of infections including retinitis (inflammation of the 
retina), pneumonia, colitis (inflammation of the colon), encephalitis 
(inflammation of the brain), mononucleosis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and uveitis. 
CMV syndrome and fever of unknown origin (known as pyrexia) are complications 
that may occur. CMV is a common a cause of serious disability such as neural 
tube defects. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are serious birth defects with 
symptoms that range from mild to severe impairment. They are caused by 
incomplete development of the brain, spinal cord, and/or their protective 
coverings. Spina bifida is the most common neural tube defect. Spina bifida 
occurs when the spine fails to close properly during the first few weeks of 
pregnancy, causing damage to the nerves and spinal cord. It is estimated that 
more than 70,000 people in the United States are living with spina bifida.</p> 
<p>Other herpes viruses:</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6): Human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) has been 
linked to two conditions, roseola and lyphotrophic virus. HHV-6 has also been 
considered as a possible cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), along with 
HHV-3 or varicella zoster. CFS patients can have extremely high levels of 
antibodies to HHV-6, meaning there is an infection present. HHV-6 infection is 
a major cause of opportunistic viral infections in patients with compromised 
immune systems, especially due to AIDS or organ transplants. HHV-6 may cause 
rejection of transplanted organs and death. HHV-6 may also be a cause of 
multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic (long-term) inflammatory condition of the 
central nervous system (CNS) resulting in changes in sensation, visual 
problems, muscle weakness, depression, difficulties with coordination and 
speech, severe fatigue, cognitive impairment, problems with balance, 
overheating, and pain. MS will cause impaired mobility and disability in more 
severe cases.</p> 
<p>Roseola (also known as sixth disease, exanthem subitum, and roseola 
infantum) is a viral illness in young children most commonly affecting those 
between the ages of six months and two years. It is typically marked by several 
days of high fever (over 102 degrees Fahrenheit), followed by a distinctive 
rash that occurs when the fever breaks.</p> 
<p>There are two different types of HHV-6, the first type being responsible 
for roseola, and the second responsible for infections in adults with weakened 
immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or cancer. This is the type that is thought to 
be associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 7 (HHV-7): Human herpesvirus type 7 (HHV-7) is 
closely related to both HHV-6 and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Of the three viruses, 
HHV-7 is the least pathogenic (disease causing). Like HHV-6, HHV-7 primarily 
causes roseola in infants and young children, which is a febrile (fever) 
illness that typically lasts for six days.</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8): Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) is a 
type of herpes virus responsible for diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), 
lymphoproliferative disorders (condition of too many white blood cells 
produced), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's 
disease (MCD). This virus only attacks immunocompromised individuals, such as 
those with HIV and AIDS. The virus has been identified in all types of KS, 
including classic, endemic, post-transplant, and AIDS-related KS, all of which 
have identical features under the microscope. Research suggests that HHV-8 
infection is spread by mouth-to-mouth contact (kissing) or genital contact. 
Previous studies on Kaposi's sarcoma have indicated that HHV-8 was more 
commonly found in saliva than in genital secretions.</p> 
<h2>RISK FACTORS AND CAUSES</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, herpes labialis): Everyone is at risk 
for HSV-1 (herpes labialis or oral herpes). It is easily transmitted and is the 
most common form of the herpes simplex virus. Oral herpes (cold sores or fever 
blisters) affects between 15-30% of the entire population, and most people are 
infected when they are with highest incidence first occurring between six 
months and three years old. HSV-1 can be spread by close contact with someone 
who has a cold sore or by using items contaminated with the virus. Kissing 
someone on the mouth will spread the virus and sharing personal items such as 
razors, towels, or eating utensils with a person who has oral herpes will 
increase the risk of getting HSV-1. The virus can also be spread to the genital 
area of another individual by having oral sex. Individuals with oral herpes 
should not perform oral sex on their partners. They should also avoid kissing. 
Infants and young children (up to three years old) have an increased risk of 
being exposed to HSV-1 due to immune systems that are still not fully developed.
</p> 
<p>Exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet light is a common trigger for the 
formation of cold sores. Stress on the body due to illness or excessive 
exercise can weaken the body's immune system and lead to an outbreak of oral 
herpes. Common examples of stress or illness include infection, fever, a cold, 
physical injury, dental surgery, menstruation, medications (including 
steroids), or illnesses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that 
suppress the immune system, eczema, excessive exercise, and emotional stress.
</p> 
<p>It should be noted that HSV-1 is becoming a major cause of genital herpes 
as well and in some studies it is now a more important cause.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HHV-2, genital herpes): Anyone who is sexually 
active is at risk for genital herpes and it is on the rise. Some reports 
estimate 31 million cases of HHV-2 or genital herpes occur in sexually active 
adults annually in the United States. The risk of HSV-2 infection is higher in 
women than in men. The largest increases in HSV-2 occur in women after their 
early twenties. Women have an 80- 90% chance of contracting HSV-2 after 
unprotected sexual activity with an infected partner and are 1.7 times more 
likely to be infected than men. Men, however, have twice as many recurrent 
infections as women. Less than one percent of American children younger than 
fifteen test positive for HSV-2; sexual abuse should be considered in children 
with HSV-2. Although African Americans are more likely to test positively for 
HSV-2, Caucasians have a higher risk for active genital symptoms and over the 
past few years the greatest increase in HSV-2 has been observed in white 
adolescents.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox): Before the introduction of the 
vaccine, about four million cases of chickenpox were reported in the United 
States each year. Between 75-90% of chickenpox cases occur in children under 10 
years of age. Since a varicella vaccine became available in the United States 
in 1995, however, the incidence of disease and hospitalizations due to 
chickenpox are showing a dramatic decrease. Experts expect the disease to 
become a rarity in the United States.</p> 
<p>The risk of chickenpox is high in late winter and early spring months. 
Primary transmission of chickenpox includes direct contact with the individual 
carrying the virus or by inhaling the virus from the air. It can also be 
transmitted from direct contact with the open sores. However, clothing and 
bedding do not usually spread the disease.</p> 
<p>An individual with chickenpox can transmit the disease from about two days 
before the appearance of the spots to the end of the blister stage. This period 
lasts about five to seven days. Once dry scabs form, the disease is unlikely to 
spread.</p> 
<p>Most schools allow children with chickenpox back after ten days of onset to 
avoid the risk of spreading the infection. Some require children to stay home 
until the skin has completely cleared, although this measure is not necessary 
to prevent transmission.</p> 
<p>Individuals at a higher risk for developing chickenpox include individuals 
of any age who have neither had chickenpox in the past nor been immunized 
against chickenpox, newborns, individuals with a weakened immune system, and 
individuals who are taking immunosuppressant drugs. Also at risk are 
individuals who are moderately or severely ill and are not yet fully recovered, 
individuals who have disorders affecting the blood, bone marrow, or lymphatic 
system, the elderly, and pregnant women. If an individual is not immune to 
chickenpox, traveling abroad can increase the risk of contracting the condition.
</p> 
<p>Males (both boys and men) have a higher risk for a severe case of 
chickenpox than females. The older the child, the higher the risk for a more 
severe case. But even in such circumstances, chickenpox is rarely serious in 
children.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (shingles): About 500,000 cases of shingles occur 
each year in the United States. Anyone who has had chickenpox has risk for 
shingles later in life, which means that 90% of U.S. adults are at risk for 
shingles. Shingles occurs in about 10-20% of adults who have had chickenpox. 
The risk for herpes zoster increases as people age, so the overall number of 
cases will undoubtedly increase as the baby boomer generation gets older. One 
study estimated that an individual who reaches 85 has a 50% chance of having 
herpes zoster. The risk for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN, or pain that persists 
after the outbreak healed) is also highest in older people with the infection, 
increasing dramatically after age 50. Individuals whose immune systems are 
impaired from diseases such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or childhood cancer have a risk for 
herpes zoster that is much higher than those with healthy immune systems. In 
fact, herpes zoster in people who are HIV positive may be a sign of full-blown 
AIDS. Current drugs used for HIV, called protease inhibitors, may also increase 
the risk for herpes zoster. Cancer places people at high risk for herpes 
zoster. At highest risk are those with Hodgkin's disease (13-15% of these 
patients develop shingles). About seven to nine percent of patients with 
lymphomas and between one to three percent of patients with other cancers have 
herpes zoster. Individuals who take certain drugs that suppress the immune 
system are at risk for shingles (as well as other infections) including 
azathioprine (Imuran&copy;), chlorambucil (Leukeran&copy;), cyclophosphamide 
(Cytoxan&copy;), and cyclosporine (Sandimmune&copy;, Neoral&copy;). These drugs 
are used in patients who have undergone organ transplantation, but they are 
also often used for severe autoimmune diseases caused by the inflammatory 
process. Such disorders include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative 
colitis.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, one study suggested that previously infected adults who are 
exposed to children with chickenpox may receive an extra boost in antibody 
production that can actually help them fight off herpes zoster. This means that 
as more children are vaccinated against chickenpox, more adults may be at risk 
for herpes zoster. There is a vaccine now available that may prevent shingles 
or lessen its effects (Zostavax&copy;). The vaccine is for people 60 or older 
who have had chickenpox but who have not had shingles.</p> 
<p>Although most common in adults, shingles can also develop in children. One 
study reported that only five percent of shingles cases occur in those under 
age 15. Children with immune deficiencies are at highest risk. Children with no 
immune problems and those who had chickenpox before they were one year-old are 
at higher risk for shingles. It is still uncommon, however.</p> 
<h2>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, oral herpes): Symptoms of cold sores 
are blisters on or around the lips and the edge of the mouth. The first symptom 
that may appear during an outbreak of oral herpes or cold sores may include 
tingling, burning, or itching in the area around the mouth or nose. This first 
portion of the outbreak is known as the prodromal stage or period. Within a few 
hours to days, the area may become reddened and develop small fluid-filled 
blisters called vesicles. Several of these small blisters may even come 
together and form one large blister. Cold sore blisters usually break open, 
weep clear fluid, and then crust over and disappear after a few days. The 
patient may experience symptoms including a sore mouth that makes eating, 
drinking, and sleeping uncomfortable. Other symptoms include fever, sore 
throat, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Symptoms usually last seven to ten 
days.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HHV-2, genital herpes): Signs of genital 
herpes (HSV-2) tend to develop within three to seven days of skin-to-skin 
contact with an infected person. Genital herpes infections look like small 
blisters or ulcers (round areas of broken skin) on the genitals. Each blister 
or ulcer is typically only one to three millimeters in size, and the blisters 
or ulcers tend to occur in groups. The blisters usually form first then soon 
open to form ulcers. Herpes infections may be painless or slightly tender. In 
some individuals, however, the blisters or ulcers can be very tender and 
painful. In men, genital herpes (sores or lesions) usually appear on or around 
the penis. In women, the lesions may be visible outside the vagina, but they 
commonly occur inside the vagina. Lesions inside the vagina may cause 
discomfort or vaginal discharge, but may be difficult to see, except during a 
doctor's examination. In any individual, ulcers or blisters may be found 
anywhere around the genitals (the perineum) and in and around the anus. The 
first herpes outbreak is usually the most painful, and the initial episode may 
last longer than later outbreaks. Some individuals develop other signs of 
herpes infection, particularly with the first episode, including fever, muscle 
aches, headaches (may be severe), vaginal discharge, painful urination, and 
swollen and tender lymph glands in the groin (glands swell as the body tries to 
fight the infection). If the disease returns, later outbreaks generally have 
much less severe symptoms. Many individuals with recurrent disease develop pain 
in the area of the infection even before any blisters or ulcers can be seen. 
This pain is due to irritation and inflammation of the nerves leading to the 
infected area of skin. These are signs that an outbreak is about to start. An 
individual is particularly contagious during this period, even though the skin 
still appears normal.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox): Individuals with chickenpox may notice 
several symptoms before the typical chickenpox rash appears. Known as 
prodromal, or early symptoms, they include fever, a vague feeling of sickness, 
or decreased appetite. Within a few days, a rash appears as small red pimples 
or blisters. The rash appears in batches over the next two to four days. It 
usually starts on the trunk and then spreads to the head, face, arms, and legs. 
Blisters may also be found in the mouth or the genital areas, because the virus 
can affect mucous membranes. Although some individuals may have only a few 
blisters, some have 100-300 blisters present. The pimples will progress to red 
teardrop blisters about five to ten millimeters (1/4-1/2 inch) wide. The 
blisters mature, break open, form a sore, and then crust over. Most of the 
blisters will heal within 10-14 days, and usually do not cause scarring unless 
the blisters become infected.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (shingles): Shingles usually begins with an 
unpleasant itching, burning, tingling, or painful sensation in a band-like 
area. The period of time when these sensations occur without a skin rash is 
called the prodromal period. During this time, the individual may have symptoms 
including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, anxiety (nervousness), and discomfort 
in the skin (usually on one side of the face, torso, trunk, back, or buttocks). 
The discomfort may feel like numbness, itching, burning, stinging, tingling, 
shooting pain, electric shock, sharp pain, and extreme sensitivity to even 
light touch. Symptoms of active shingles includes a rash that begins as a 
reddish band or individual bumps running in a line and bumps developing with 
fluid-filled centers. Over the course of seven to 10 days, the bumps begin to 
dry and crust over. The individual may continue to have pain and/or itching in 
the area of the rash. The pain may be severe. If the rash develops on the side 
of the nose or elsewhere on the face, the individual should contact their 
healthcare provider immediately. This can signal that the eyes may be infected. 
Although the rash of active shingles usually subsides within a week to a month, 
some individuals continue to have pain and discomfort well after the rash has 
healed. This syndrome of pain in the area of the previously infected nerve is 
called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and it can be quite severe and 
debilitating.</p> 
<p>Epstein Barr virus: Epstein-Barr virus can cause fever, a sore throat, 
swollen lymph glands- especially in the neck, and extreme fatigue or tiredness. 
Although typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mononucleosis can 
also be caused by other herpes viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV). 
Infection with EBV during adolescence or young adulthood results in 
mononucleosis in 35-50% of the cases. The incubation period for the 
mononucleosis is usually seven to 14 days in children and adolescents. The 
incubation period in adults is longer; at times it may be 30-50 days. If 
symptoms of mononucleosis last more than six months, it is frequently referred 
to as chronic EBV infection. EBV may be linked to chronic fatigue syndrome, a 
condition of chronic tiredness and exhaustion.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of mononucleosis develop slowly, with such mild symptoms initially 
that it may be mistaken for a cold or the flu. As the condition progresses the 
symptoms may include a sore throat that lasts two weeks or more, swollen lymph 
nodes (in the neck, armpits, and groin), a persistent fever, fatigue 
(tiredness), and malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort). These symptoms can be 
mild or so severe that throat pain impedes swallowing and fever reaches 105 
degrees Fahrenheit. Some individuals also experience a rash, eye pain, 
photophobia (discomfort with bright light), and a swollen spleen or liver. In 
most cases of mononucleosis, no specific treatment is necessary as the illness 
is usually self-limiting. Although the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis 
usually resolve in one or two months, the EBV remains dormant in cells in the 
throat and blood for the rest of the person's life. Periodically, the virus can 
reactivate and can be found in the saliva of infected persons. This 
reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness, although it may be 
linked to symptoms of CFS. EBV also establishes a lifelong dormant infection in 
some cells of the body's immune system.</p> 
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV): In people with weakened immune systems (such as 
those with HIV or AIDS), cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause any number of 
infections including retinitis (inflammation of the retina), pneumonia, colitis 
(inflammation of the colon), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), 
mononucleosis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and uveitis. CMV syndrome and fever of 
unknown origin (known as pyrexia) are complications that may occur. CMV is a 
common a cause of serious disability such as neural tube defects. Neural tube 
defects (NTDs) are serious birth defects with symptoms that range from mild to 
severe impairment. They are caused by incomplete development of the brain, 
spinal cord, and/or their protective coverings.</p> 
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2> 
<p>Physical exam: Signs and symptoms associated with herpes viral infections 
in humans can vary greatly depending upon the specific virus infecting the 
individual. Healthcare providers diagnose this group of infections by visual 
inspection and by taking a sample from the sore(s) for testing in a laboratory. 
Between outbreaks, these herpes infections can be difficult to diagnose. Viral 
diagnostic tests can also be performed to determine what type of herpes virus 
is infecting the individual.</p> 
<p>Herpes viral infections may be confused with other conditions. 
Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox), particularly in early stages, may be 
confused with herpes simplex, impetigo (bacterial skin infection), insect 
bites, or scabies (skin infection by mites). The early prodromal stage of 
shingles can cause severe pain on one side of the lower back, chest, or abdomen 
before the rash appears. It therefore may be mistaken for disorders, such as 
gallstones, that cause acute pain in internal organs. In the active rash stage, 
shingles may be confused with herpes simplex virus, particularly in young 
adults and if the blisters occur on the buttocks or around the mouth. Herpes 
simplex does not usually generate severe or chronic pain. A diagnosis may be 
difficult if herpes zoster takes a non-typical course, such as with Bell's 
palsy (a neurological condition involving facial paralysis) or Ramsay Hunt 
syndrome (a neurologic disorder caused by a varicella zoster virus that infects 
certain nerves in the head) or if it affects the eye or causes fever and 
delirium.</p> 
<p>Viral culture: A viral culture uses specimens taken from the blister, fluid 
in the blister, or sometimes spinal fluid. The samples are sent to a laboratory 
where they are analyzed. It takes between one and 14 days to detect the virus 
in the preparation made from the specimen. A viral culture is also sometimes 
used in vaccinated patients to determine if a varicella-like infection is 
caused by a natural virus or by the vaccine. This test is useful, but it is 
sometimes difficult to detect the virus in the samples.</p> 
<p>Immunofluorescence assay: Immunofluorescence is a diagnostic technique used 
to identify antibodies to a specific virus. In the case of herpes zoster, the 
technique uses ultraviolet rays applied to a preparation composed of cells 
taken from the patient's zoster blisters. The specific characteristics of the 
light, as seen through a microscope, will identify the presence of the 
antibodies. This test is less expensive, more accurate, and faster than a viral 
culture.</p> 
<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) uses a 
piece of the DNA of the virus, which is then replicated millions of times until 
the virus is detectable. A sample of the individual's tissue from a sore is 
prepared and analyzed in a complicated laboratory test. This technique is 
expensive but is useful for unusual cases, such as identifying infection in the 
brain and spinal cord. This type of testing would be used to detect the 
presence of the herpes simplex virus in those who have genital sores, 
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and in newborns suspected of having 
neonatal herpes (a rare but serious condition where herpes is contracted during 
birth). A pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with herpes may be monitored 
regularly prior to delivery to identify a reactivation of her infection (which 
would indicate the necessity for a caesarean section to avoid infecting the 
baby). The primary methods of testing for the virus are the herpes culture and 
HSV DNA testing.</p> 
<p>A positive herpes simplex culture or HSV DNA test from a vesicle scraping 
indicates an active HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. A negative test result does not 
definitely rule out the presence of virus; for instance, the test may not be 
accurate if the herpes simplex virus was not isolated from the vesicle scraping.
</p> 
<h2>COMPLICATIONS</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus: Although genital herpes usually causes mild symptoms, 
some people may experience recurrent painful genital ulcers, which can be 
especially severe in people with suppressed immune systems. Like other sexually 
transmitted diseases (STDs), herpes may also increase the risk for transmitting 
or acquiring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p> 
<p>All herpes viruses can be passed from mother to baby. The chance of giving 
herpes to the baby is highest if the first infection occurs near the time of 
delivery. The virus can be transmitted to the fetus while in-utero (inside the 
womb) or during passage through an infected vagina at birth. First-time 
infection during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of miscarriage, decreased 
fetal growth, and preterm labor. About 30-50% of infants who are born vaginally 
to a mother with first-time infection become infected with the herpes virus. Of 
babies born to women experiencing recurrent herpes at the time of birth, one to 
four percent become infected with the herpes-simplex virus.</p> 
<p>If a woman is having an active outbreak of genital herpes at the time of 
delivery, the baby will usually be delivered by cesarean section to prevent 
transmission of herpes. Of infants infected with herpes at birth, 30-60% die 
within the first month. Survivors may have long-term complications such as 
mental retardation and seizures. To prevent transmission of herpes to their 
babies, pregnant women should discuss any past history of herpes with their 
healthcare providers and take adequate measures to prevent infection during 
pregnancy. The risk of herpes can be reduced during pregnancy by avoiding 
sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, and oral) during the last three months of 
pregnancy if the partner is known to have or suspected of having genital herpes 
and avoiding receptive oral sex during the last three months of pregnancy if 
the partner is known to have or suspected of having herpes sores on the mouth, 
tongue, gum, or lips. Infidelity plays an important role in genital herpes 
transmission.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) can also cause several ocular (eye) lesions 
including HSV blepharitis, HSV conjunctivitis, HSV keratitis, HSV infectious 
epithelial keratitis, HSV anterior uveitis, and HSV retinitis.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus: Pregnant women and anyone with immune system 
problems should not be near a person with chickenpox. If a pregnant woman who 
has not had chickenpox in the past contracts the virus (especially in the first 
20 weeks of pregnancy), the fetus is at risk for birth defects. The mother is 
at risk for more health complications than if she had been infected when she 
was not pregnant. If the mother develops chickenpox just before or after the 
child is born, the newborn is at risk for serious health complications. There 
is no risk to the developing baby if the woman develops shingles during the 
pregnancy. If a pregnant woman has had chickenpox before the pregnancy, the 
baby will be protected from infection for the first few months of life, since 
the mother's immunity gets passed on to the baby through the placenta and 
breast milk. Those at risk for severe disease or serious complications may be 
given varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG, a vaccine for varicella-zoster 
virus) after exposure to chickenpox to reduce its severity. This group of 
people includes newborns whose mothers had chickenpox at the time of delivery, 
individuals with leukemia or immune deficiencies, and children receiving drugs 
that suppress the immune system.</p> 
<p>Chickenpox rarely causes complications, but it is not always harmless. Five 
out of every 1,000 children who have the infection require hospitalization, 
and, in rare cases, chickenpox can be fatal. Chickenpox has caused about 11,000 
hospitalizations each year and 100 deaths per year in the United States. 
Widespread vaccination, however, has produced a dramatic decline in these 
numbers.</p> 
<p>The most common complications of chickenpox include itching, infections 
(usually from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes), scarring 
(complicated by scratching), ear infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis 
(inflammation of the brain). Other extremely rare complications of chickenpox 
include problems in blood clotting and inflammation of the nerves in the hands 
and feet. Inflammation in other parts of the body, including the heart, 
testicles, liver, joints, or kidney, may also occur. Such cases of inflammation 
are almost always temporary in otherwise healthy patients.</p> 
<p>Complications of shingles (herpes zoster) include post-herpatic neuropathy 
(PHN) pain, which can either be continuous burning or aching pain, periodic 
piercing pain, or spasm similar to electric shock. The pain tends to be more 
severe at night. Temperature changes can also affect pain. The pain may extend 
beyond the areas of the initial zoster attack and some areas have no feeling at 
all. In most cases, it does not affect daily life. Rarely, however, the pain of 
herpes zoster affects sleep, mood, work, and overall quality of life. This can 
lead to fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, social withdrawal, and impaired 
daily functioning. Itching is also common in individuals with shingles. 
Infections may occur in the blisters associated with shingles.</p> 
<p>Shingles may lead to meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the 
brain) or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The encephalitis is 
generally mild and resolves in a short period. In rare cases, particularly in 
patients with impaired immune systems, these inflammations can be severe and 
even life-threatening. Also, in rare situations herpes zoster can infect the 
urinary tract and cause difficult urination. The condition is temporary but may 
require a catheter to eliminate urine in some patients who have prolonged 
difficulty urinating. If shingles occurs in the face, the eyes are at risk, 
particularly if the path of the infection follows the side of the nose. Severe 
infections can occur if the eyes become involved that are difficult to treat 
and can threaten vision, called herpes zoster ophthalmicus. AIDS patients may 
be at particular risk for a chronic infection in the cornea of the eye. Herpes 
zoster can also cause a devastating infection in the retina called imminent 
acute retinal necrosis syndrome. In such cases, visual changes develop within 
weeks or months after herpes zoster outbreak has resolved. It should be noted 
that this complication does not always follow a herpes outbreak in the face but 
can occur after an outbreak in any part of the body. Prompt treatment with a 
drug called acyclovir (Zovirax&copy;) can often halt the progress of vision 
loss, at least in people with healthy immune systems.</p> 
<p>In very rare cases, herpes zoster has been associated with Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, an extensive and serious condition in which blisters cover most 
mucous membranes along with large areas of the body.</p> 
<p>Ramsay Hunt syndrome: Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a condition of facial 
paralysis and rash on the ear or mouth that occurs during a herpes zoster viral 
infection. Symptoms include severe ear pain and hearing loss, ringing in the 
ear(s), loss of taste, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Ramsay Hunt syndrome 
may also cause a mild inflammation in the brain. The dizziness may last for a 
few days or even for weeks, but usually resolves. Severity of hearing loss 
varies from partial to total. However, this hearing loss almost always goes 
away. Facial paralysis, on the other hand, may be permanent.</p> 
<p>Bell's palsy: Bell's palsy is partial paralysis of the face. In some cases, 
it is difficult to distinguish between Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 
particularly in the early stages. Ramsay Hunt syndrome tends to be more severe 
than Bell's palsy. Some healthcare providers recommend oral prednisone (a 
corticosteroid) along with an antiviral drug (such as acyclovir or 
Zovirax&copy;) within seven days after symptoms appear.</p> 
<h2>TREATMENT</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus:</p> 
<p>Genital herpes: There are three antiviral medications that the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for the treatment of genital herpes. 
Approved antiviral drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax&copy;), valacyclovir 
(Valtrex&copy;), and famciclovir (Famvir&copy;). Antiviral medication is 
commonly prescribed for patients having a first episode of genital herpes, but 
they can be used for recurrent episodes as well. There are two kinds of 
treatment regimens: episodic therapy and suppressive therapy. With episodic 
therapy, the patient begins taking the medication at the first sign of 
recurrence. The medication is then taken for several days to hasten the 
recovery or healing or to prevent a full outbreak from fully occurring. All 
three of the antiviral treatments mentioned above have been proven to help 
shorten the amount of time that a person may experience symptoms of herpes. 
However, results may vary from person to person. Side effects of antiviral 
medicines include stomach upset, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
headache, dizziness, and/or weakness.</p> 
<p>Suppressive therapy is used in individuals with genital herpes who want to 
eliminate (suppress) outbreaks altogether. Suppressive therapy is usually given 
to patients who have six or more recurrences per year. For these individuals, 
studies have reported that suppressive therapy may reduce the number of 
outbreaks by at least 75% while the medication is being taken. Also, for some, 
taking an antiviral on a daily basis can prevent outbreaks altogether. 
Suppressive therapy may completely prevent outbreaks in some patients. Side 
effects include nausea and vomiting. Suppressive therapy may need to be taken 
life-long.</p> 
<p>Oral herpes: Medications that are swallowed to treat oral herpes include 
the antiviral medications acyclovir (Zovirax&copy;), valacyclovir 
(Valtrex&copy;), and famciclovir (Famvir&copy;). There are two topical 
antiviral medications prescribed for the treatment of oral herpes-simplex virus 
(HSV)- topical acyclovir ointment (Zovirax&copy;) and topical penciclovir cream 
(Denavir&copy;). Both of these drugs work to speed up the healing process and 
reduce the viral activity. These drugs are put directly on the lesions 
themselves, but can also be used at the onset of prodrome (early symptoms of 
itching and burning lasting up to one to two days).</p> 
<p>Other topical treatments for oral herpes are available over-the-counter 
(OTC), but are not antiviral compounds like acyclovir and penciclovir. Some 
also contain anesthetic ingredients (such as lidocaine or benzocaine) that numb 
the area and induce temporary relief from the discomfort of an outbreak. 
Unfortunately, some OTC treatments may actually delay the healing time of 
symptoms because they can further irritate the area with repeated applications. 
There is only one U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cream, 
docosanol (Abreva&copy;), the only OTC drug that has been clinically proven to 
help speed the healing process.</p> 
<p>Infected individuals can also prevent recurring outbreaks by avoiding some 
of the known causes. During an outbreak, symptomatic relief may be obtained by 
keeping the area clean and dry, or by taking pain relievers (such as aspirin, 
acetaminophen, or ibuprofen). Some patients with genital herpes find relief by 
taking a bath where a person simply sits in a tub with warm water up to the 
hips).</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox):</p> 
<p>Pain medications: Treatment for chickenpox includes pain medicines such as 
acetaminophen (Tylenol&copy;) or ibuprofen (Motrin&copy;, Advil&copy;). Do not 
give children less than 18 years of age aspirin, as a dangerous condition 
called Reye's syndrome can develop.</p> 
<p>Soothing baths: Frequent baths are particularly helpful in relieving 
itching, especially when used with preparations of finely ground (colloidal) 
oatmeal. Commercial preparations of oatmeal, such as Aveeno&copy;, are 
available in drugstores, or one can be made at home by grinding or blending dry 
oatmeal into a fine powder. Use about two cups per bath. The oatmeal will not 
dissolve, and the water will have a scum. One-half to one cup of baking soda in 
a bath may also be helpful.</p> 
<p>Lotions: Calamine&copy; lotion and similar over-the-counter preparations 
can be applied to soothe the skin and help dry out blisters and soothe the skin.
</p> 
<p>Antihistamines: For severe itching, a type of over the counter medication 
called antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl&copy;) is useful; it also helps 
children sleep.</p> 
<p>Antiviral drugs: Acyclovir is an antiviral drug that may be used in adult 
varicella-zoster patients or those of any age with a high risk for 
complications and severe forms of chickenpox. The drug may also benefit smokers 
with chickenpox, who are at higher than normal risk for pneumonia. Some experts 
recommend its use for children who catch chickenpox from other family members 
because such patients are at risk for more serious cases. To be effective, oral 
acyclovir must be taken within 24 hours of the first signs of the rash. Early 
intravenous (IV) administration of acyclovir is also treatment for chickenpox 
pneumonia. Foscavir (Foscarnet&copy;) is an injectable antiviral agent commonly 
used in treating cytomegalovirus (an infection caused by herpesvirus type 5). 
It is used in cases of varicella-zoster strains that have become resistant to 
acyclovir (Zovirax&copy;) and similar drugs. Administered intravenously (into 
the veins), the drug can have toxic effects, such as kidney damage (which is 
reversible) and seizures. Fever, nausea, and vomiting are common side effects. 
It can also cause ulcers on the genitals organs. As with other drugs, it does 
not cure shingles. Antiviral drugs require a prescription.</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster virus (shingles):</p> 
<p>The treatment goals for an acute (immediate) attack of shingles (herpes 
zoster) include reduce pain, reduce discomfort, hasten healing of blisters, and 
prevent the disease from spreading. Over-the-counter remedies are often 
effective in reducing the pain of an attack.</p> 
<p>Antiviral drugs: Antiviral agents (acyclovir or Zovirax&copy;), 
corticosteroids (prednisone or Delatasone&copy;) are sometimes given to 
patients with severe symptoms, particularly if they are older and at risk for 
postherpes neuralgia.</p> 
<p>Antihistamines: In general, to prevent or reduce itching, home treatments 
are similar to those used for chickenpox. Patients can try antihistamines, 
particularly diphenhydramine (Benadryl&copy;, either orally or topically), 
oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.</p> 
<p>Oral corticosteroids: Drugs called oral corticosteroids, including 
methylprednisolone (Medrol&copy;) or prednisone (Deltasone&copy;), are used for 
inflammation associated with shingles. They have some benefit for reducing pain 
and accelerating healing in acute attacks of shingles when used with acyclovir 
(Zovirax&copy;). However, they are not recommended without acyclovir. They also 
may be helpful for improving symptoms of Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 
Corticosteroids do not appear to prevent a further attack or reduce the risk 
for post herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Side effects of corticosteroids, including 
weight gain and lowered immunity, can be severe and oral steroids should be 
taken at as low a dose and for as short a time as possible.</p> 
<p>Epidural blocks: Epidural blocks are injections of local anesthetics, pain 
medications, or steroids outside the tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord 
(the dura matter). The injected substances block the nerves and offer relief 
from acute herpes zoster pain for some people. Some studies, but not all, have 
indicated that if they are given early enough (within two months), they may 
prevent nerve damage that leads to postherpetic neuralgia. Combinations of 
anesthetics with steroids in the epidural blockade may be particularly 
beneficial. This procedure is invasive, however, and is not widely used.</p> 
<p>Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers: For an acute (immediate) shingles 
attack, individuals may take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, including 
acetaminophen (Tylenol&copy;) or ibuprofen (Motrin&copy;, Advil&copy;). 
Children should take acetaminophen, not aspirin. Adults may take aspirin. Such 
remedies, however, are not very effective for postherpetic neuralgia.</p> 
<p>Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN):</p> 
<p>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is difficult to treat. Once PHN develops, a 
multidisciplinary approach that involves a pain specialist, psychiatrist, 
primary care physician, and other healthcare professionals may provide the best 
means to relieve the pain and distress associated with this condition.</p> 
<p>Anesthetic patches: Topical (on the skin) preparations, including a skin 
patch containing the anesthetic drug lidocaine (Lidoderm&copy;), are generally 
used. They are effective in many people without producing any known severe side 
effects. The patch appears to reduce pain and improve quality of life for many 
patients. One to four patches can be applied over the course of 24 hours. 
Another patch (EMLA&copy;) contains both the anesthetic drugs lidocaine and 
prilocaine. These patches are expensive and require a prescription. The most 
common side effects are skin redness or rash.</p> 
<p>Topical creams: Capsaicin (Zostrix&copy;) is prepared from the active 
ingredient in hot chili peppers. An ointment form has been approved for 
postherpetic neuralgia and is available over-the-counter (OTC). Its benefits 
are limited, however, and it is uncertain whether they are meaningful for most 
patients. A new patch form that uses a higher than standard dose may be more 
effective than current options. In one study, it reduced pain by 33% in nearly 
half of patients. Capsaicin should not be used until the blisters have 
completely dried out and are falling off the skin. Capsaicin ointment should be 
handled using a glove, and applied to affected areas three or four times daily. 
The patient will usually experience a burning sensation when the drug is first 
applied, but this sensation diminishes with use. It may take up to six weeks 
for the patient to experience its full effect, however, and about a third 
cannot tolerate the burning sensation. Many find no benefit.</p> 
<p>Topical aspirin, known chemically as triethanolamine salicylate 
(Aspercreme&copy;), may bring relief. Also, menthol-containing creams such as 
Ben Gay&copy; and Flexall 454&copy; may be helpful.</p> 
<p>Oral medicines: Low-dose tricyclic antidepressant (TCAs), preferably 
nortriptyline (Pamelor&copy;, Aventyl&copy;), is also used. Side effects 
include drowsiness, fatigue (tiredness), dry mouth, and constipation. If that 
does not work, gabapentin (Neurontin&copy;), an anti-seizure drug, can be used. 
Doctors usually start with a low dose and slowly increase the amount given 
until relief or severe side effects occur. Side effects include drowsiness and 
nausea or vomiting. Also, a type of painkilling drugs known as opiates, 
including oxycodone (Oxycontin&copy;) or hydrocodone (Vicodin&copy;, 
Lortab&copy;), may be used. These drugs cause drowsiness and may cause physical 
dependence, even in short term use (two weeks or less).</p> 
<p>Investigative agents: Cannabinoids are compounds in marijuana (cannabis) 
that may have properties that protect nerve cells. They are being studied for a 
number of nerve-disorders, including chronic nerve-related pain. In one study, 
they were effective in reducing pain and had no major side effects.</p> 
<p>Mexiletine (Mexitil&copy;) is a calcium channel blocking agent that alters 
nerve impulse transmission. It is normally used for heart rhythm disorders but 
is being used in some cases for PHN in patients who do not respond to standard 
agents. The agent can have adverse effects, including serious allergic 
reactions, nausea, vomiting, flushing, and arrhythmias (irregular heart beat).
</p> 
<p>Psychological approaches: A number of relaxation and stress-reduction 
techniques are helpful in managing chronic pain. They include meditation, deep 
breathing exercises, biofeedback, and muscle relaxation. Such techniques may 
apply to those with severe pain from acute infection and from persistent 
long-term postherpetic neuralgia. Cognitive behavioral therapy is showing 
benefit in enhancing patients' beliefs in their own abilities for dealing with 
pain. Using specific tasks and self-observation, patients gradually shift their 
fixed ideas that they are helpless against the pain that dominates their lives 
to the perception that it is only one negative and, to a degree, a manageable 
experience among many positive ones.</p> 
<h2>INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES</h2> 
<p>Good scientific evidence:</p> 
<p>Aloe: The transparent gel from the pulp of the meaty leaves of aloe (Aloe 
vera) has been used topically (on the skin) for thousands of years to treat 
wounds, skin infections, burns, and numerous other dermatologic conditions. 
Limited evidence suggests that aloe in a cream preparation is an effective 
treatment for genital herpes in men. Additional research is warranted in this 
area.</p> 
<p>Caution is advised when taking aloe supplements, as adverse effects 
including diarrhea and drug interactions are possible. Aloe supplements should 
not be used if pregnant or breast feeding, unless otherwise directed by a 
doctor. Do not use for more than three days without consulting a doctor.</p> 
<p>Lemon balm: Several clinical studies have reported that a topical 
preparation of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) heals sores associated with 
oral herpes simplex virus infections (herpes simplex type 1). More studies are 
needed in this area.</p> 
<p>Based on available research, lemon balm taken by mouth has been reported to 
be relatively well tolerated when taken for up to eight weeks. Evidence for 
topical administration of cream suggested minimal side effects for up to 10 
days of application. Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to lemon balm. Avoid 
with Grave's disease or thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Use cautiously in 
glaucoma because lemon balm may increase eye pressure. Use caution when 
operating heavy machinery. Lemon balm preparations may contain trace amounts of 
lead. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Para-aminobenzoic acid: Evidence of para-aminobenzoic acid's (PABA) 
possible antiviral activity have led to its study as a therapeutic agent for 
herpetic keratitis. Actipol&copy; is a 0.007% PABA solution for ophthalmic use 
that has been studied for this purpose and found to be effective in most 
patients. Further randomized trials may help to confirm its effectiveness for 
this indication.</p> 
<p>Sunlight exposure, particularly ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (290-320nm), 
has been shown to stimulate recurrence of the herpes simplex virus infection on 
the mouth. Sunscreens are known to prevent erythema and sunburn following 
exposure to UVB rays. For this reason, it is hypothesized that sunscreens may 
be capable of preventing UVB-induced reactivation of recurrent herpes labialis 
infection (prevention) in predisposed patients.</p> 
<p>Avoid with known hypersensitivity to PABA or its derivatives. Avoid oral 
use in children and pregnant or nursing women. Use cautiously in patients with 
renal disease, bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants, diabetics or 
patients at risk for hypoglycemia. Discontinue use if rash, nausea, or anorexia 
occurs. Pharmaceutical doses of PABA and its derivatives should only be taken 
under appropriate medical supervision. PABA should not be given concurrently 
with sulfonamides.</p> 
<p>Sage: Early laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that sage extracts 
may be useful in the treatment of herpes skin manifestations. Additional 
research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to sage, its constituents, or to 
members of the Lamiaceae family. Use cautiously with hypertension (high blood 
pressure). Use the essential oil or tinctures cautiously in patients with 
epilepsy. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Zinc: Proper nutrition, including vitamins and minerals, has been reported 
to help in decreasing recurrent herpes simplex virus infections. Lesser quality 
studies have been conducted to assess the effects of zinc (topical or taken by 
mouth) in herpes type 1 or type 2. A small study found that oral zinc sulphate 
appeared to reduce both the number of episodes and the time to recovery of 
herpes labialis. Several of these studies used combination treatments or 
permitted the continued use of other medications, so the exact role of zinc in 
those studies is unclear. However, the positive results obtained in most trials 
suggest that zinc may represent a safe and effective alternative or adjunct 
treatment for herpes type 1 and 2, and should encourage further research into 
the topic using well-designed studies.</p> 
<p>Zinc is generally considered safe when taken at the recommended dosages. 
Avoid zinc chloride since studies have not been done on its safety or 
effectiveness. Avoid with kidney disease. Use cautiously if pregnant or 
breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Unclear or conflicting scientific evidence:</p> 
<p>Acupuncture: Several clinical studies have reported that acupuncture 
therapy is effective in reducing the pain associated with post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN). More studies need to be performed before a firm conclusion can 
be drawn.</p> 
<p>Needles must be sterile in order to avoid disease transmission. Avoid with 
valvular heart disease, infections, bleeding disorders, medical conditions of 
unknown origin, or neurological disorders. Avoid if taking drugs that increase 
the risk of bleeding (e.g. anticoagulants). Avoid on areas that have received 
radiation therapy and during pregnancy. Use cautiously with pulmonary disease 
(e.g. asthma or emphysema). Use cautiously in elderly or medically compromised 
patients, diabetics, or with history of seizures. Avoid electroacupuncture with 
arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) or in patients with pacemakers because therapy 
may interfere with the device.</p> 
<p>Alizarin: Limited available evidence suggests that alizarin may be of 
benefit in the treatment of viral infections. Additional research is needed in 
this area.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to alizarin or any plants in the 
Rubiaceae family. Alizarin may be toxic and should not be handled for long 
periods of time, rubbed in the eyes, or eaten. Avoid if pregnant or 
breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Astragalus: Some studies suggest that astragalus may inhibit herpes 
viruses. Additional research is needed in this area.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic to astragalus, peas, or any related plants or with a 
history of Quillaja bark-induced asthma. Avoid with aspirin or aspirin products 
or herbs or supplements with similar effects. Avoid with inflammation 
(swelling) or fever, stroke, or transplant or autoimmune diseases (like 
HIV/AIDS). Stop use two weeks before surgery/dental/diagnostic procedures with 
a risk of bleeding and avoid use immediately after these procedures. Use 
cautiously with bleeding disorders, diabetes, high blood pressure, lipid 
disorders, or kidney disorders. Use cautiously with blood-thinners, blood sugar 
drugs, or diuretics or herbs and supplements with similar effects. Avoid if 
pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Blessed thistle: Laboratory studies report no activity of blessed thistle 
against herpes viruses, influenza, or poliovirus. Effects of blessed thistle 
(or chemicals in blessed thistle called lignans) against HIV are not clear. 
Human research of blessed thistle as a treatment for viral infections is 
lacking.</p> 
<p>Blessed thistle is generally considered to be safe when taken by mouth in 
recommended doses for short periods of time, with few reported side effects 
such as birth defects, bleeding, breathing problems, bruising, cancer of the 
nose or throat, increased production of stomach acid, itching, kidney disease, 
liver toxicity, skin rash, stomach discomfort, stomach ulcers, and vomiting. 
Allergic reactions to blessed thistle including rash may occur, as well as 
cross-sensitivity to mugwort and Echinacea. Cross-reactivity may also occur 
with bitter weed, blanket flower, Chrysanthemum, coltsfoot, daisy, dandelion, 
dwarf sunflower, goldenrod, marigold, prairie sage, ragweed or other plants in 
the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Chlorophyll: Oral consumption of chlorophyll liquid was reported in 
clinical study to be effective in both herpes simplex and varicella-zoster 
infections. More clinical research is needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to chlorophyll or any of its 
metabolites. Use cautiously with photosensitivity, compromised liver function, 
diabetes or gastrointestinal conditions or obstructions. Use cautiously if 
taking immunosuppressant agents or antidiabetes agents. Avoid if pregnant or 
breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Cranberry: Limited laboratory research has examined the antiviral activity 
of cranberry. Further research is warranted in this area.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic to cranberries, blueberries, or other plants of the 
Vaccinium species. Sweetened cranberry juice may affect blood sugar levels. Use 
cautiously with a history of kidney stones. Pregnant and breastfeeding women 
should avoid cranberry in higher amounts than what is typically found in foods.
</p> 
<p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO): Topical use of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) has been 
reported effective in the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles). Limited 
available study reported that benefits may be more effective when DMSO is 
combined with the drug idoxuridine. Further research is necessary.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to DMSO. Use caution with urinary tract 
cancer or liver and kidney dysfunction. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Honey: Honey is a sweet, viscid fluid produced by honeybees (Apis 
melliflera) from the nectar of flowers. It has been used for thousands of years 
as a healing agent. Limited available clinical study found that topical honey 
may be effective in treating labial but not genital herpes. More research is 
needed in this area to draw a conclusion.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to honey, pollen, celery, or bees. 
Honey is generally considered safe in the recommended doses. Avoid honey from 
the genus Rhododendron because it may cause a toxic reaction. Avoid in infants 
younger than 12 months of age. Use cautiously if taking antibiotics. Avoid in 
patients with diabetes. Potentially harmful contaminants (e.g. C. botulinum or 
grayanotoxins) can be found in some types of honey and should be used 
cautiously if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Hypnosis: Hypnosis is associated with a deep state of relaxation. A small 
study showed potential benefit of a hypnotherapeutic treatment program for 
patients suffering from recurrent orofacial herpes infections. Further research 
is needed to confirm these results.</p> 
<p>Use cautiously with mental illnesses (e.g. psychosis, schizophrenia, manic 
depression, multiple personality disorder, or dissociative disorders) or 
seizure disorders.</p> 
<p>Licorice: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has been found in laboratory 
studies to hinder the spread and infection of the herpes simplex virus. 
Clinical studies need to be performed.</p> 
<p>Avoid with a known allergy to licorice, any component of licorice, or any 
member of the Fabaceae (Leguminosae) plant family. Avoid with congestive heart 
failure, coronary heart disease, kidney or liver disease, fluid retention, high 
blood pressure, hormonal abnormalities or if taking diuretics. Licorice can 
cause abnormally low testosterone levels in men or high prolactin or estrogen 
levels in women. This may make it difficult to become pregnant and may cause 
menstrual abnormalities.</p> 
<p>Peppermint oil: The essential oil from peppermint (Mentha piperita) has 
been reported effective in decreasing recurrent herpes infection. Case study 
found that topical peppermint oil was effecting in reducing the pain of 
post-herpetic neuralgia. More clinical studies are needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to peppermint or menthol. Peppermint is 
generally considered safe in non-allergic adults when taken in small doses. Use 
cautiously with G6PD deficiency or gallbladder disease. Menthol, which makes up 
part of peppermint oil, is generally considered safe in non-allergic adults. 
However, doses of menthol greater than 1 gram per kilogram of body weight may 
be deadly in humans. Peppermint oil may burn the skin if undiluted. Avoid if 
pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Propolis: Propolis is a natural flavonoid-rich resin created by bees, used 
in the construction of hives. Propolis is produced from the buds of conifer and 
poplar tress, in combination with beeswax and other bee secretions. A limited 
number of laboratory studies have demonstrated effectiveness of propolis and 
its constituents against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Preliminary 
results from human trials suggest some degree of efficacy of topical propolis 
for resolving the lesions associated with genital herpes virus infections. 
There is also limited research of propolis for the treatment of post-herpetic 
corneal complications. Some evidence suggests that propolis may speed up 
healing and improve sight. More clinical research is needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to propolis, black poplar (Populas 
nigra), poplar bud, bee stings, bee products, honey, or Balsam of Peru. Severe 
allergic reactions have been reported. Use cautiously with asthma or 
gastrointestinal disorders. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding because of the 
high alcohol content in some products.</p> 
<p>Reishi: Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) has been reported to improve 
immune system function in humans. Reishi extract was shown to be effective in 
decreasing post-herpetic neuralgia in case study. However, there is 
insufficient data to make any conclusion at this time.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to any constituents of Ganoderma 
lucidum or any member of its family. Use cautiously with diabetes, blood 
disorders (including hemophilia), low blood pressure or ulcers. Avoid if 
pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Rhubarb: Clinical study indicates that topically applied rhubarb-sage 
extract cream may reduce the symptoms of herpes. It was compared to acyclovir 
(Zovirax&copy;) cream and was equally effective in relieving the symptoms. More 
high quality studies using rhubarb as a monotherapy are needed to discern 
rhubarb's effect on herpes symptoms.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic/hypersensitive to rhubarb, its constituents, or related 
plants from the Polygonaceae family. Avoid using rhubarb for more than two 
weeks because it may induce tolerance in the colon, melanosis coli, laxative 
dependence, pathological alterations to the colonic smooth muscles, and 
substantial loss of electrolytes. Avoid with atony, colitis, Crohn's disease, 
dehydration with electrolyte depletion, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, insufficient 
liver function, intestinal obstruction or ileus, irritable bowel syndrome, 
menstruation, pre-eclampsia, renal disorders, ulcerative colitis and urinary 
problems. Avoid handling rhubarb leaves, as they may cause contact dermatitis. 
Avoid rhubarb in children under age 12 due to potential water depletion. Use 
cautiously with bleeding disorders, cardiac conditions, coagulation therapy, 
constipation, history of kidney stones, or thin or brittle bones. Use 
cautiously if taking anti-psychotic drugs or oral drugs, herbs or supplements 
(including calcium, iron, and zinc). Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Sorrel: There is currently not enough evidence on the proposed antiviral 
effects of sorrel. More research is needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid large doses of sorrel because there have been reports of toxicity and 
death. This may be because of the oxalate found in sorrel. Many sorrel 
tinctures contain high levels of alcohol and should be avoided when driving or 
operating heavy machinery. These sorrel formulations may cause nausea or 
vomiting when taken with the prescription drugs metronidazole (Flagyl&copy;) or 
disulfiram (Antabuse&copy;). Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Tai chi: Tai chi is a system of movements and positions believed to have 
developed in 12th Century China. Tai chi techniques aim to address the body and 
mind as an interconnected system, and are traditionally believed to have mental 
and physical health benefits to improve posture, balance, flexibility, and 
strength. Limited available study showed that treatment with tai chi may 
increase immunity to the virus that causes shingles. This may suggest the use 
of tai chi in the prevention of chickenpox (varicella zoster) and shingles, but 
further well-designed large studies should be performed. Tai chi may also help 
with physical fitness, which is important with individuals with weakened immune 
systems.</p> 
<p>Avoid with severe osteoporosis or joint problems, acute back pain, sprains, 
or fractures. Avoid during active infections, right after a meal, or when very 
tired. Some believe that visualization of energy flow below the waist during 
menstruation may increase menstrual bleeding. Straining downwards or holding 
low postures should be avoided during pregnancy, and by people with inguinal 
hernias. Some tai chi practitioners believe that practicing for too long or 
using too much intention may direct the flow of chi (qi) inappropriately, 
possibly resulting in physical or emotional illness. Tai chi should not be used 
as a substitute for more proven therapies for potentially serious conditions. 
Advancing too quickly while studying tai chi may increase the risk of injury.
</p> 
<p>Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil, from the Melaleuca alternifolia tree, has been 
proposed as a potential topical therapy for genital herpes simplex virus 
infections based on in vitro findings of antiviral activity. However, at this 
time there is insufficient human evidence to recommend either for or against 
this use of tea tree oil for recurrent herpes labialis infection.</p> 
<p>Tea tree oil should not be taken internally, although vaginal and rectal 
use is recommended by some healthcare providers. Apply tea tree oil with a 
cotton ball. If sensitivity develops, such as rash or irritation, diluting the 
oil with water may help. If the rash or irritation continues, discontinue use. 
Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia), 
any of its constituents, balsam of Peru, benzoin, colophony (rosin) tinctures, 
eucalyptol, or other members of the Myrtle (Myrtaceae) family. Avoid if taking 
antineoplastic agents. Avoid if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>TENS: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive 
technique in which a low-voltage electrical current is delivered through wires 
from a small power unit to electrodes located on the skin or using 
acupuncture-like needles. TENS is believed to help stimulate the chi or energy 
of the body. TENS has been effectively used in treating pain associated with 
post-herpetic neuralgia in several clinical studies. However, more studies are 
needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid with implantable devices, like defibrillators, pacemakers, 
intravenous infusion pumps, or hepatic artery infusion pumps. Use cautiously 
with decreased sensation, like neuropathy, and with seizure disorders. Avoid if 
pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Turmeric: Turmeric is a perennial plant native to India and Indonesia, and 
it is often used as a spice in cooking. Based on early research, turmeric may 
help treat various viral infections. However, reliable human studies are 
lacking in this area. Well-designed trials are needed.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic or hypersensitive to turmeric (curcumin), yellow food 
colorings, or plants belonging to the Curcuma or Zingiberaceae (ginger) 
families. Use cautiously with a history of bleeding disorders, immune system 
deficiencies, liver disease, or gallstones. Use cautiously with blood thinners 
(e.g. warfarin). Use cautiously if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Fair negative scientific evidence:</p> 
<p>Echinacea: Initial human studies suggest that echinacea is not helpful in 
the treatment of genital herpes. More research is needed to confirm these 
results.</p> 
<p>Avoid if allergic to echinacea, its constituents, or any members of the 
Asteraceae/Compositae family (ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies). Use 
cautiously in patients prone to atopic reactions and in those with 
hemochromatosis and diabetes. Some natural medicine experts discourage the use 
of echinacea by people with conditions affecting the immune system, such as 
HIV/AIDS, some types of cancer, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, and 
rheumatologic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus). Use parenteral 
preparations of echinacea (no longer approved for use in Germany) cautiously. 
Use tinctures cautiously with alcoholic patients or in patients taking 
disulfiram or metronidazole. Avoid using echinacea in patients presenting for 
anesthesia. Use cautiously if pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Historical or theoretical uses lacking sufficient evidence:</p> 
<p>Arabinoxylan: Arabinoxylan is produced from Hyphomycetes mycelia mushroom 
extract. Arabinoxylan has been used traditionally for herpes zoster infection 
and post-herpetic neuralgia. Arabinoxylan increases immune function and may 
help the body fight off infection. Clinical studies are needed to support these 
uses.</p> 
<p>Use cautiously if elderly or with kidney dysfunction, due to potentially 
high calcium and phosphorus content. Use cautiously with diabetes. Avoid if 
pregnant or breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>Lysine: In preliminary study, lysine has been investigated for its effects 
on the herpes simplex virus. Study results are conflicting at this time. 
Additional high quality clinical research is needed to make a conclusion.</p> 
<h2>PREVENTION</h2> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, herpes labialis, oral herpes):</p> 
<p>Taking steps to guard against the development of cold sores, to prevent 
spreading them to other parts of the body, or to avoid passing them along to 
another person is important when dealing with oral herpes.</p> 
<p>Contact with infected individuals: The virus can spread easily as long as 
there are moist secretions from blisters. In individuals with depressed immune 
systems, the virus can be spread even after the skin appears to be healed. 
Also, not kissing others on the mouth if a herpes viral infection is present is 
important.</p> 
<p>Sharing common items: Utensils, towels, water glasses, and other commonly 
used items can spread the virus when blisters are present.</p> 
<p>Clean hands: Washing the hands carefully before touching another person 
when a cold sore is present is very important. The eyes and genital area may be 
particularly susceptible to spread of the virus.</p> 
<p>Triggers: Avoiding or preventing conditions that stress the body, such as 
poor diet, not getting enough sleep, or staying in the sun for long periods of 
time without applying sun-block is very important in preventing oral herpes 
outbreaks.</p> 
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2, genital herpes):</p> 
<p>Measures for preventing genital herpes are the same as those for preventing 
other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). HSV-2 is highly contagious while 
lesions are present. The best way to prevent infection is to abstain from 
sexual activity or to limit sexual contact to only one person who is 
infection-free. Individuals should use, or have their partner use, a latex 
condom during each sexual contact, limit the number of sex partners, avoid any 
contact with a partner who has sores until the sores are completely healed, or 
use a male or female condom during anal, oral, or vaginal sex (however, 
transmission can still occur if the condom does not cover the sores), avoid 
having sex just before or during an outbreak since the risk for transmission is 
highest at that time, and ask the sexual partner if they have ever had a herpes 
outbreak or been exposed to the herpes virus. Also, getting tested for 
herpes-simplex viruses is important if the individual is sexually active 
outside of a monogamous relationship.</p> 
<p>If an individual is pregnant, it is important to tell the doctor that HSV 
is present. If the individual has had unprotected sex and is unsure, testing 
for HSV is recommended by healthcare professionals. Watch for signs and 
symptoms of HSV during pregnancy. A doctor may recommend that the individual 
start taking herpes antiviral medications when they are about 36 weeks pregnant 
to try to prevent an outbreak from occurring around the time of delivery. If 
the individual is having an outbreak when they go into labor, the doctor will 
probably suggest a Caesarean section to reduce the risk of passing the virus to 
the baby.</p> 
<p>A vaccine in clinical trials is being tested in women who have not been 
infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV). The vaccine is Herpevac&copy; and may 
become available for prevention of genital and oral herpes infections.</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 3 (varicella-zoster virus, chickenpox):</p> 
<p>Varivax&copy;: A vaccine for varicella-zoster infections is now used to 
prevent chickenpox. Varivax&copy;, a live virus vaccine, produces persistent 
immunity against chickenpox. Data show that the vaccine can prevent chickenpox 
or reduce the severity of the illness even if it is used within three days, and 
possibly up to five days, after exposure to the infection. The vaccine against 
chickenpox is now recommended in the United States for all children between the 
ages of 18 months and adolescence who have not yet had chickenpox. Children are 
given one dose of the vaccine. Two doses one to two months apart are given to 
people over 13 years of age. To date, more than 75% of children have been 
vaccinated.</p> 
<p>Some experts suggest that every healthy adult without a known history of 
chickenpox be vaccinated. Adults without such a history of infection by 
varicella-zoster should strongly consider vaccination if they are adults who 
are at high risk of exposure or transmission (hospital or day care workers, 
parents of young children), individuals who live or work in environments in 
which viral transmission is likely, individuals who are in contact with people 
who have compromised immune systems, non-pregnant women of childbearing age, 
adolescents and adults living in households with children, and international 
travelers.</p> 
<p>Women who are trying to become pregnant should postpone conception until 
three months after the vaccine.</p> 
<p>Side effects of Varivax&copy; include discomfort at the injection site. 
About 20% of vaccine recipients have pain, swelling, or redness at the 
injection site. Only about five percent of adverse reactions are serious. 
Adverse events may include seizures, pneumonia, anaphylactic reaction (a 
life-threatening allergic reaction), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), 
Stevens-Johnsons syndrome, neuropathy (nerve damage), herpes zoster, and blood 
abnormalities. The vaccine may also produce a mild rash within about a month of 
the vaccination that has been known to transmit chickenpox to others. 
Individuals who have recently been vaccinated should avoid close contact with 
anyone who might be susceptible to severe complications from chickenpox until 
the risk for a rash has passed. Months or even years after the vaccination, 
some people develop a mild infection termed modified varicella-like syndrome 
(MVLS). The condition appears to be less contagious and have fewer 
complications than naturally acquired chickenpox.</p> 
<p>There is currently intense debate over the long-term protection of the 
vaccine. Studies have reported that more than 15% of vaccinated children still 
develop chickenpox (called breakthrough infections). The long-term protective 
effect for adults is even less clear. Between 1979 and 1999, it was reported 
that although nine percent developed chickenpox months to years after their 
last vaccination, in all cases, infection was mild with none of the serious 
complications of adult chickenpox. A 2003 study on booster shots in older 
adults suggests that revaccination with the live virus is safe and effective.
</p> 
<p>Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG): Varicella-zoster immune globulin 
(VZIG) is a substance that triggers an immune response against the 
varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is used to protect high-risk patients who are 
exposed to chickenpox or those who cannot receive a vaccination of the live 
virus. Such groups include pregnant women with no history of chickenpox, 
newborns under four weeks who are exposed to chickenpox or shingles, premature 
infants, children with weakened immune systems, adults with no immunity to VZV, 
and recipients of bone-marrow transplants (even if they have had chickenpox). 
VZIG should be given within 96 hours and no later than ten days after exposure 
to someone with chickenpox.</p> 
<p>Human herpesvirus type 3 (varicella-zoster virus, shingles):</p> 
<p>Zostavax&copy;: Zostavax&copy; is a live vaccine made from the herpes 
zoster virus that causes shingles. Zostavax&copy; has been reported to reduce 
the incidence of herpes zoster by 51.3% in adults aged 60 and older who 
received the vaccine. The vaccine also reduced by 66.5% the number of cases of 
postherpetic neuralgia and reduced the severity and duration of pain and 
discomfort associated with shingles by 61.1%. Zostovax was approved by the U. 
S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2006. The FDA recommended it only 
for adults aged 60 and older who meet requirements. These requirements include 
not having a life-threatening allergy to gelatin nor a life-threatening allergy 
to the antibiotic neomycin or other component of the herpes zoster vaccine. 
Individuals should not have a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDS human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or any 
other disease. Patients should also not be on other disease medications, such 
as steroids, radiation, or chemotherapy, which affect the immune system. There 
should be no history of cancer of the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as 
leukemia or lymphoma, and also no active or untreated tuberculosis. Side 
effects include headache, itching, and tenderness or redness at site of 
injection.</p> 
<p>Zostavax&copy; is not a substitute for Varivax&copy; in children. </p>
