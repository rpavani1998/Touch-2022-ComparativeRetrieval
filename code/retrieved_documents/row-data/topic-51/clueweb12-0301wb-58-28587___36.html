 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of migraine.
Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>New Migraine Drug Approved</strong></p> 
<p>In April 2008, the FDA approved a new prescription drug (Treximet) for 
treatment of migraine headache attacks. Treximet is a pill that contains a 
combination of the triptan drug sumatriptan (Imitrex) and the anti-inflammatory 
pain reliever naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Some studies have indicated that a 
combination of sumatriptan and naproxen works better for migraine pain relief 
than either drug alone.</p> 
<p><strong>Migraine Triggers</strong></p> 
<p>Migraines can be triggered by many everyday things. Different people 
respond to different triggers, so it is important to track your migraine 
patterns to help avoid migraine attacks. Common migraine triggers include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Emotional stress</li> 
<li>Intense physical exertion</li> 
<li>Abrupt weather changes</li> 
<li>Bright or flickering lights</li> 
<li>High altitude</li> 
<li>Travel motion</li> 
<li>Lack of sleep</li> 
<li>Skipping meals</li> 
<li>Odors</li> 
<li>Certain types of foods and beverages (aged cheese, chocolate, red wine, 
beer, coffee, and many others)</li> 
<li>Food additives or preservatives (nitrates, nitrates, monosodium glutamate)
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Migraine Treatment Approaches</strong></p> 
<p>Migraines need a two-pronged approach: Treatment and prevention. Treatment 
uses medications that provide quick pain relief when attacks occur. These drugs 
include pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
triptans such as sumatriptan (Imitrex), and ergotamine drugs.</p> 
<p>Preventive strategies begin with non-drug approaches (behavioral therapies, 
lifestyle changes). If headache attacks continue to occur on a weekly basis, 
your doctor may recommend you try preventive medication. Drugs currently 
approved for migraine prevention include the beta-blocker drugs propanolol 
(Inderal) and timolol (Blacadrene), and the anti-seizure drugs divalproex 
(Depakote) and topiramate (Topamax).</p> Back to Top <br>
 Introduction 
<p>The pain from a headache does not start from inside the brain. (The brain 
itself can not feel pain.) Instead, headache pain begins in one or more of the 
following locations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The tissues covering the brain</li> 
<li>The structures at the base of the brain</li> 
<li>Muscles and blood vessels around the scalp, face, and neck</li> </ul> 
<p>Headache is generally categorized as primary or secondary.</p> 
<p><i>Primary Headache.</i> A headache is considered primary when a disease or 
other medical condition does not cause it.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tension headache is the most common primary headache and accounts for 90% 
of all headaches. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> # 11: 
Tension headaches.]</li> 
<li>Neurovascular headaches are the second most common primary headaches. This 
type includes migraines and cluster headaches. [Fore more information, see<em>
In-Depth Report</em> # 99: Cluster headaches.] Such headaches are caused by an 
interaction between blood vessel and nerve abnormalities.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<br>

<p><i>Secondary Headache.</i> Secondary headaches are caused by other medical 
conditions, such as sinusitis, neck injuries or abnormalities, and stroke. 
About 2% of headaches are secondary headaches caused by abnormalities or 
infections in the nasal or sinus passages.</p> 
<p>It is not uncommon for someone to experience a combination of headache 
types.</p> Click the icon to see a comparison of headache symptoms. <br>

<br> 
<h3>Migraine Headaches</h3> 
<p>Migraine is the most common form of disabling headache that prompts 
patients to seek care from doctors. Migraines are sometimes classified as 
occurring with aura (previously called classic migraine) or without aura 
(previously called common migraine).</p> 
<p>In general, there are four phases to a migraine (although they may not all 
occur in every patient): The prodrome phase, auras, the attack, and the 
postdrome phase.</p> 
<p><i>Prodrome.</i> The prodrome phase is a group of vague symptoms that may 
precede a migraine attack by several hours, or even a day or two. Prodrome 
symptoms include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sensitivity to light or sound</li> 
<li>Changes in appetite, including decreased appetite or food cravings</li> 
<li>Thirst</li> 
<li>Fatigue and drowsiness</li> 
<li>Mood changes including depression, irritability, or restlessness</li> </ul>
<p><i>Auras.</i> Auras are sensory disturbances that occur before the migraine 
attack in 1 in 5 patients. Visually, auras are referred to as being positive or 
negative:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Positive auras include bright or shimmering light or shapes at the edge of 
their field of vision called scintillating scotoma. They can enlarge and fill 
the line of vision. Other positive aura experiences are zigzag lines or stars.
</li> 
<li>Negative auras are dark holes, blind spots, or tunnel vision (inability to 
see to the side).</li> 
<li>Patients may have mixed positive and negative auras. This is a visual 
experience that is sometimes described as a fortress with sharp angles around a 
dark center.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other neurologic symptoms may occur at the same time as the aura, although 
they are less common. They include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Speech disturbances</li> 
<li>Tingling, numbness, or weakness in an arm or leg</li> 
<li>Perceptual disturbances such as space or size distortions</li> 
<li>Confusion</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Migraine Attack.</i> If untreated, attacks usually last from 4 - 72 
hours. A typical migraine attack produces the following symptoms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Throbbing pain on one side of the head. The word migraine, in fact, is 
derived from the Greek word hemikrania, meaning &quot;half of the head&quot; 
because the pain of migraine often occurs on one side. Pain also sometimes 
spreads to affect the entire head.</li> 
<li>Pain worsened by physical activity</li> 
<li>Nausea, sometimes with vomiting</li> 
<li>Visual symptoms</li> 
<li>Facial tingling or numbness</li> 
<li>Extreme sensitivity to light and noise</li> 
<li>Looking pale and feeling cold</li> </ul> 
<p>Less common symptoms include tearing and redness in one eye, swelling of 
the eyelid, and nasal congestion, including runny nose. (Such symptoms are more 
common in certain other headaches, notably cluster headaches.)</p> 
<p><i>Postdrome.</i> After a migraine attack, there is usually a postdrome 
phase, in which patients may feel exhausted and mentally foggy for a while.</p> 
<h3>Chronic Migraines</h3> 
<p>In some cases, patients eventually experience on-going and chronic 
headaches. Some doctors believe that, unless otherwise demonstrated, any 
chronic headache consisting of episodes of disabling pain that recur regularly 
over years should be considered as a migraine.</p> 
<p>Chronic migraines may occur from overuse of migraine medications (called a 
rebound headache) or may develop over time (called transformed migraine).</p> 
<p><i>Rebound Headache.</i> The most common cause of chronic migraine is the 
rebound effect, which is a cycle caused by overuse of migraine medications. The 
process involves the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients typically have taken pain medication for more than 3 days a week 
on an ongoing basis.</li> 
<li>When the patients stop taking medication, they experience a rebound 
headache.</li> 
<li>They start taking the drugs again.</li> 
<li>Eventually the headache simply persists, and medications are no longer 
effective.</li> </ul> 
<p>Medications implicated in rebound migraines include nonprescription 
painkillers (acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen), barbiturates, sedatives, 
narcotics, and migraine medications, particularly those that also contain 
caffeine. (Heavy caffeine use can also cause this condition.)</p> 
<p><i>Transformed Migraines.</i> In some cases, migraines themselves evolve 
into chronic, daily headaches called transformed migraines. Such headaches 
resemble tension headaches but are more likely to be accompanied by 
gastrointestinal distress and mental or visual disturbances and, in women, to 
be affected by menstrual cycles. In one study, the risk for transformed 
migraines were associated with other factors, including allergies, asthma, 
hypothyroidism, hypertension, and a daily intake of caffeine.</p> 
<h3>Other Migraine Variations</h3> 
<p>Although migraine is considered to be a specific chronic illness, it has 
various presentations that occur in different individuals.</p> 
<p><i>Menstrual Migraines.</i> Migraines are often tied to a woman's menstrual 
cycle, typically in the first days preceding or beginning menstruation. 
Researchers think that estrogen plays a role. About half of women with 
migraines report an association with menstruation. Compared to migraines that 
occur at other times of the month, menstrual migraines tend to be more severe, 
last longer, and not have auras. Triptan drugs can provide relief and may also 
help prevent these types of migraines.</p> 
<p><i>Ophthalmoplegic Migraine.</i> This very rare headache tends to occur in 
younger adults. The pain centers around one eye and is usually less intense 
than in a standard migraine. It may be accompanied by vomiting, double vision, 
a droopy eyelid, and paralysis of eye muscles. Attacks can last from hours to 
months. A computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may 
be needed to rule out an aneurysm (a rupture blood vessel) in the brain.</p> 
<p><i>Retinal Migraine.</i> Symptoms of retinal migraine are short-term blind 
spots or total blindness in one eye that lasts less than an hour. A headache 
may precede or occur with the eye symptoms. Sometimes retinal migraines develop 
without headache. Other eye and neurologic disorders must be ruled out.</p> 
<p><i>Basilar Migraine.</i> Considered a subtype of migraine with aura, this 
migraine starts in the basilar artery, which forms at the base of the skull. It 
occurs mainly in young people. Symptoms may include vertigo (the room spins), 
ringing in the ears, slurred speech, unsteadiness, possibly loss of 
consciousness, and severe headaches.</p> 
<p><i>Familial Hemiplegic Migraine.</i> This is a very rare inherited genetic 
migraine disease. It can cause temporary paralysis on one side of the body, 
vision problems, and vertigo. These symptoms occur about 10 - 90 minutes before 
the headache.</p> 
<p><i>Status Migrainosus.</i> This is a serious and rare migraine. It is so 
severe and lasts so long that it requires hospitalization.</p> Back to Top <br>

 Prognosis 
<p>For many people, migraines eventually go into remission and sometimes 
disappear completely, particularly as they age. Estrogen decline after 
menopause may be responsible for remission in some older women.</p> 
<h3>Complications</h3> 
<p><em>Risk for Stroke and Heart Disease</em>. Migraine or severe headache is 
a risk factor for stroke in both men and women, especially before age 50. About 
19% of all strokes occur in people with a history of migraine. Research 
indicates that migraine may also increase the risk for other types of heart 
problems.</p> 
<p>Migraine with aura appears to carry a higher risk for stroke than migraine 
without aura, especially for women. Some studies suggest that people who have 
migraine with aura are more likely than people without migraine to have 
cardiovascular risk factors (high cholesterol, high blood pressure) that 
increase the risk for stroke.</p> 
<p>Researchers are also studying the relationship between patent foramen ovale 
(PFO) and migraine. A PFO is a hole in the wall dividing the upper left and 
right heart chambers. About half of patients with PFO have severe migraines 
with aura. Researchers are investigating whether surgical repair of the PFO may 
help control migraines in patients with this heart condition.</p> 
<p><em>Emotional Disorders and Quality of Life</em>. Migraines have a 
significant negative impact on quality of life, family relations, and work 
productivity. Studies indicate that people with migraines have poorer social 
interactions and emotional health than patients with many chronic medical 
illnesses, including asthma, diabetes, and arthritis. Anxiety (particularly 
panic disorders) and major depression are also strongly associated with 
migraines.</p> 
<p>A National Headache Foundation-sponsored survey of migraine sufferers 
reported that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>90% of people with migraines could not function normally on the day of a 
migraine attack</li> 
<li>80% experienced abnormal sensitivity to light and noise</li> 
<li>75% experienced nausea and vomiting</li> 
<li>30% required bed rest</li> 
<li>25% missed at least 1 day of work due to migraine in past 3 months</li> 
</ul> Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>Until recently, the general theory on the migraine process rested solely on 
the idea that abnormalities of blood vessel (vascular) systems in the head were 
responsible for migraines. Now, however, doctors tend to believe that migraine 
starts with an underlying central nervous system disorder. When triggered by 
various stimuli, this disorder sets off a chain of neurologic and biochemical 
events, some of which subsequently affect the brain's vascular system. No 
experimental model fully explains the migraine process.</p> 
<p>There is certainly a strong genetic component in migraine with or without 
auras. Researchers have located a single genetic mutation responsible for the 
very rare familial hemiplegic migraine, but several genes are likely to be 
involved in the great majority of migraine cases.</p> 
<p>Numerous chemicals, structures, nerve pathways, and other players involved 
in the process are under investigation. These include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Peptides</em>. Stress or some unknown factor triggers the release of 
certain protein fragments called peptides (Substance P, calcitonin gene-related 
peptide, and others). These peptides dilate blood vessels and produce an 
inflammatory response that triggers over-excitation of the nerve cells in the 
trigeminal pathway. [This nerve pathway runs from the brain stem to the head 
and face. These nerves spread to the meninges (the membrane covering of the 
brain).]</li> 
<li><i>Abnormal Calcium Channels.</i> Some migraines may be due to 
abnormalities in the channels within cells that transport the electrical ions 
calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Calcium channels appear to play a 
particularly critical role in migraine.</li> 
<li><i>Serotonin and Other Neurotransmitter Levels.</i> Neurotransmitters are 
chemical messengers in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (chemical 
messenger in the brain) that is important for sleep, well-being, and other 
factors that affect quality of life. Abnormalities in serotonin levels have 
been observed in both tension-type and migraine headache sufferers. Altered 
levels of other neurotransmitters, importantly dopamine and stress hormones, 
also occur with migraine and tension-type headaches, and could trigger the 
events in the brain leading to migraine.</li> 
<li><i>Reduced Magnesium Levels.</i> Magnesium deficiencies have been observed 
in people with both tension-type and migraine headaches. Reduced levels could 
be a destabilizing factor, causing the nerves in the brain to misfire, possibly 
even accounting for the auras that many sufferers experience.</li> 
<li><i>Nitric Oxide.</i> Other research suggests that over-excitable neurons 
release nitric oxide, a small molecular messenger that may be important in 
triggering in most primary headaches (tension-type, cluster, and migraines).
</li> 
<li><i>Estrogen Fluctuations in Women.</i> Tension-type headaches and migraine 
headaches are slightly more common in females during adolescence and adulthood. 
Most likely hormone<i>fluctuations</i>, rather than whether levels are elevated 
or low, trigger headaches.</li> 
<li><i>Inflammation in the Maxillary Nerve</i>. Early studies suggest that 
some chronic tension-type and migraine headaches may be caused by inflammation 
in the nerve that runs behind the cheekbone (the maxillary nerve) -- not around 
the covering of the brain. In fact, some work using ice water for reducing 
swelling in areas of the gums above the last upper molars has relieved some 
severe migraine and tension-type headaches.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Migraine Triggers</h3> 
<p>A wide range of events and conditions can alter conditions in the brain 
that bring on nerve excitation and trigger migraines. They include, but are not 
limited to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Emotional stress</li> 
<li>Intense physical exertion (exercise, lifting, and even bowel movements or 
sexual activity)</li> 
<li>Abrupt weather changes</li> 
<li>Bright or flickering lights</li> 
<li>Odors</li> 
<li>High altitude</li> 
<li>Travel motion</li> 
<li>Lack of sleep</li> 
<li>Skipping meals</li> 
<li>Certain types of foods, and chemicals contained in them. More than 100 
foods and beverages may potentially trigger migraine headache. Caffeine is one 
such trigger. Caffeine withdrawal can also trigger migraines in people who are 
accustomed to caffeine. Red wine and beer are also common triggers. 
Preservatives and additives (such as nitrates, nitrites, and MSG) can also 
trigger attacks. Doctors recommend that patients keep a headache diary to track 
which foods trigger migraine.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>About 29.5 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches. They affect 
about 18% of all women and 6% of men.</p> 
<h3>Gender</h3> 
<p>About 75% of all migraine sufferers are women. Migraine is more prevalent 
among women throughout the world and in every culture. Although the incidence 
of migraine is similar for boys and girls during childhood, it increases in 
girls after puberty. Migraine most commonly affects women between the ages of 
20 - 45.</p> 
<p>Fluctuations of female hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, appear 
to increase the risk for migraines and their severity in some women. About half 
of women with migraines report headaches associated with their menstrual cycle. 
For some women, migraines also tend to be worse during the first trimester of 
pregnancy, but improve during the last trimester.</p> 
<h3>Age</h3> 
<p>Migraine headaches typically affect people between the ages of 15 - 55. 
However, migraine also affects about 5 - 10% of all children. Unlike migraine 
in adults, migraines in children are equally prevalent in boys and girls. 
Studies indicate that many children with migraine eventually stop having 
attacks when they reach adulthood or transition to less severe tension-type 
headaches. Children with a family history of migraine may be more likely to 
continue having migraines.</p> 
<h3>Family History</h3> 
<p>Migraines tend to run in families. About 70 - 80% of patients with migraine 
have a family history of the condition.</p> 
<h3>Medical Conditions Associated with Migraines</h3> 
<p>Many people with migraine have or have a history of depression, anxiety, 
stroke, epilepsy, irritable bowel syndrome, or high blood pressure. These 
conditions do not necessarily increase the risk for migraine, but are 
associated with it.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>Anyone, including children, with recurring or persistent headaches should 
consult a doctor. There are no blood tests or imaging techniques that can be 
used to diagnose migraine headaches. A diagnosis will be made on the basis of 
history and physical exam, and, if necessary, tests may be necessary to rule 
out other diseases or conditions that may be causing the headaches. It is 
important to choose a doctor who is sensitive to the needs of headache 
sufferers and aware of the latest advances in treatment.</p> 
<h3>Diagnostic Criteria for Migraine</h3> 
<p>A diagnosis of migraine is usually made on the basis of repeated attacks 
(at least 5) that meet the following criteria:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Headache attacks that last 4 - 72 hours</li> 
<li>Headache has at least two of the following characteristics: Location on 
one side of the head; throbbing pain; moderate or severe pain intensity; pain 
worsened by normal physical activity (walking, climbing stairs)</li> 
<li>During the headache, the patient experiences one or both of the following 
characteristics: Nausea or vomiting; extreme sensitivity to light or sound</li> 
<li>The headache cannot be attributed to another disorder</li> </ul> 
<h3>Headache Diary</h3> 
<p>The patient should try to recall what seems to bring on the headache and 
anything that relieves it. Keeping a headache diary is a useful way to identify 
triggers that bring on headaches, as well as to track the duration and 
frequency of headache attacks. Some tips include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Note all conditions, including any foods eaten, preceding an attack. Often 
two or more triggers interact to produce a headache. For example, a combination 
of weather changes and fatigue can make headaches more likely than the presence 
of just one of these events.</li> 
<li>Keep a migraine record for at least three menstrual cycles. For women, 
this can help to confirm or refute a diagnosis of menstrual migraine.</li> 
<li>Track medications. This is important for identifying possible rebound 
headache or transformed migraine.</li> 
<li>Attempt to define the intensity of the headache using a number system, 
such as:</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1 = Mild, barely noticeable</p> 
<p>2 = Noticeable, but does not interfere with work/activities</p> 
<p>3 = Distracts from work/activities</p> 
<p>4 = Makes work/activities very difficult</p> 
<p>5 = Incapacitating</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<h3>Medical and Personal History</h3> 
<p>The patient should report any other conditions that might be associated 
with headache, including but not limited to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Any chronic or recent illness and their treatments</li> 
<li>Any injuries, particularly head or back injuries</li> 
<li>Any uncharacteristic dietary changes</li> 
<li>Any current medications or recent withdrawals from any drugs, including 
over-the-counter or natural remedies</li> 
<li>Any history of caffeine, alcohol, or drug abuse</li> 
<li>Any serious stress, depression, and anxiety</li> </ul> 
<p>The doctor will also need a general medical and family history of headaches 
or diseases, such as epilepsy, that may increase their risk. Migraine tends to 
run in families.</p> 
<h3>Physical Examination</h3> 
<p>In order to diagnose a chronic headache, the doctor will examine the head 
and neck and will usually perform a neurologic examination, which includes a 
series of simple exercises to test strength, reflexes, coordination, and 
sensation. The doctor may ask questions to test short-term memory and related 
aspects of mental function.</p> 
<h3>Differentiating Between Migraine and Other Types of Headaches</h3> 
<p><em>Differentiating Between Migraines and Tension Headaches</em>. Migraines 
and tension headaches have some similar characteristics, but also some 
important differences:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Migraine pain is throbbing and while tension-type headache pain is usually 
a steady ache</li> 
<li>Migraine pain may affect only one side of the head while tension-type 
headache pain typically affects both sides of the head</li> 
<li>Migraine pain, but not tension-type pain, worsens with head movement</li> 
<li>Migraine headaches, but not tension-type headaches, may be accompanied by 
nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, or aura</li> </ul> 
<p>[For more information, see <em>In-Depth Report</em> #11: Tension-type 
headache.]</p> 
<p><em>Differentiating Between Migraines and Sinus Headaches</em>. Many 
primary headaches, including migraine, are misdiagnosed as sinus headaches, 
causing patients to be treated inappropriately with antibiotics. Nearly 9 in 10 
patients who think they have sinus headaches actually have or probably have had 
a migraine. Sinus headaches occur in the front of the face, usually around the 
eyes, across the cheeks, or over the forehead. They are usually mild in the 
morning and increase during the day and are usually accompanied by fever, runny 
nose, congestion, and general debilitation. It is also possible for patients to 
have migraines with sinus symptoms.</p> 
<p>A real sinus headache is a sign of an acute sinus infection, which responds 
to treatment with antibiotics. If sinus headches seem to recur, the patient is 
likely actually experiencing migraines.</p> 
<h3>Imaging Tests</h3> 
<p>Imaging tests of the brain may be recommended under the following 
circumstances.</p> 
<p>If the results of the history and physical examination suggest neurologic 
problems such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Changes in vision</li> 
<li>Muscle weakness</li> 
<li>Fever</li> 
<li>Stiff neck</li> 
<li>Changes in the way someone walks</li> 
<li>Changes in someone's mental status (disorientation)</li> </ul> 
<p>For patients with headache:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>That wakes them at night</li> 
<li>A sudden or severe headache, or a headache that is the worst headache of 
someone's life</li> </ul> 
<p>Imaging tests may also be recommended for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients with a history of cancer or weakened immune system</li> 
<li>New headaches in adults over 50 years, especially in the elderly. In this 
age group, it is particularly important to first rule out age-related disorders 
including stroke, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), accumulation of fluid within 
the brain (hydrocephalus), and head injuries (usually from falls).</li> 
<li>Patients with worsening headache or headaches that do not respond to 
routine treatment.</li> </ul> 
<p>The following tests may be used:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A CT (computed tomography) scan may be ordered to rule out brain disorders 
or headaches caused by chronic sinusitis.</li> 
<li>X-rays and other tests may also be used if sinusitis is strongly suspected.
</li> 
<li>A neck x-ray can reveal arthritis or spinal problems.</li> 
<li>Other imaging tests include an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EEG 
(electroencephalogram), lumbar puncture, ultrasound testing, and cerebral 
angiography, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT). These tests are only performed if there is reason 
to suspect an underlying disease or as part of clinical studies.</li> </ul> <br>
<br> 
<h3>Symptoms that Could Indicate a Serious Underlying Condition</h3> 
<p>Headaches indicating a serious underlying problem, such as cerebrovascular 
disorder or malignant hypertension, are uncommon. (It should again be 
emphasized that a headache is not a common symptom of a brain tumor.) People 
with existing chronic headaches, however, might miss a more serious condition 
by believing it to be one of their usual headaches. Such patients should call a 
doctor promptly if the quality of a headache or accompanying symptoms has 
changed. Everyone should call a doctor for any of the following symptoms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sudden, severe headache that persists or increases in intensity over the 
following hours, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or altered mental 
states (possible hemorrhagic stroke)</li> 
<li>Sudden, very severe headache, worse than any headache ever experienced 
(possible indication of hemorrhage or a ruptured aneurysm)</li> 
<li>Chronic or severe headaches that begin after age 50</li> 
<li>Headaches in the back of the head accompanied by other symptoms, such as 
memory loss, confusion, loss of balance, changes in speech or vision, or loss 
of strength in or numbness or tingling in arms or legs (possibility of small 
stroke in the base of the skull)</li> 
<li>Headaches after head injury, especially if drowsiness or nausea are 
present (possibility of hemorrhage)</li> 
<li>Headaches accompanied by fever, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting 
(possibility of spinal meningitis)</li> 
<li>Headaches that increase with coughing or straining (possibility of brain 
swelling).</li> 
<li>A throbbing pain around or behind the eyes or in the forehead accompanied 
by redness in the eye and perceptions of halos or rings around lights 
(possibility of acute glaucoma)</li> 
<li>A one-sided headache in the temple in elderly people; the artery in the 
temple is firm and knotty and has no pulse; scalp is tender (possibility of 
temporal arteritis, which can cause blindness or even stroke if not treated)
</li> 
<li>Sudden onset and then persistent, throbbing pain around the eye possibly 
spreading to the ear or neck unrelieved by pain medication (possibility of 
blood clot in one of the sinus veins of the brain)</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Treatment Approaches 
<p>Migraine treatment involves both treating acute attacks when they occur, 
and developing preventive strategies for reducing the frequency and severity of 
attacks.</p> 
<h3>Treating Migraine Attacks</h3> 
<p>Many effective headache remedies are available for treating a migraine 
attack. Still, many patients are treated with unapproved drugs, including 
opoids and barbiturates that can be potentially addictive or dangerous.</p> 
<p>The main types of medications for treating a migraine attack are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pain relievers (usually nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs [NSAIDs] or acetaminophen)</li> 
<li>Ergotamines</li> 
<li>Triptans</li> </ul> 
<p>It is best to treat a migraine attack as soon as symptoms first occur. 
Doctors generally recommend starting with nonprescription pain relievers for 
mild-to-moderate attacks. If migraine pain is severe, a prescription version of 
an NSAID may be recommended. A triptan is generally the next drug of choice. 
Ergotamine drugs tend to be less effective than triptans, but are helpful for 
some patients. Depending on the severity of the attacks, and accompanying 
symptoms, the doctor may recommend taking a triptan or ergotamine drug in 
tablet, injection, or suppository form. The doctor may also prescribe specific 
medications for treating symptoms such as nausea.</p> 
<p>Try to guard against rebound effect. Nearly all drugs used for migraine can 
cause rebound headache, and patients should not take any the drugs more than 9 
days per month. If you find that you need to use acute migraine treatment more 
frequently, talk to your doctor about preventive medications.</p> 
<h3>Preventing Migraine Attacks</h3> 
<p>Preventive strategies for migraine include both drug treatment and 
behavioral therapy or lifestyle adjustments.</p> 
<p>Patients should consider using preventive migraine drugs if they have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Migraines that are not helped by acute treatment drugs</li> 
<li>Frequent attacks (more than once per week)</li> 
<li>Side effects from acute treatment drugs or contraindications to taking them
</li> </ul> 
<p>The main preventive drug treatments for migraine are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Beta-blocker drugs (usually propranolol [Inderal] or timolol [Blocadren]
</li> 
<li>Anti-seizure drugs (usually divalproex [Depakote] or topiramate [Topamax]
</li> 
<li>Tricyclic antidepressants {usually amitriptyline [Elavil])</li> </ul> 
<p>A preventive medication strategy needs to be carefully tailored to an 
individual patient, taking into account the patient's medical history and 
co-existing medical conditions. These drugs can have serious side effects.</p> 
<p>A preventive medication is usually started at a low dose, and then 
gradually increased. It may take 2 - 3 months for a drug to achieve its full 
effect. Preventive treatment may be needed for 6 - 12 months or longer. Most 
patients take preventive medications on a daily basis, but some patients may 
use these drugs intermittently (for example, for preventing menstrual migraine).
</p> 
<p>Patients can also help prevent migraines by identifying and avoiding 
potential triggers, such as specific foods. Relaxation therapy and stress 
reduction techniques may also help. (See Lifestyle section below.)</p> 
<h3>Treatment Approaches for Children</h3> 
<p><em>Migraine Treatment for Children.</em> Most children with migraines may 
need only mild pain relievers and home remedies (such as ginger tea) to treat 
their headaches. The American Academy of Neurology's practice guidelines for 
children and adolescents recommend the following drug treatments:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For children age 6 years and older, ibuprofen (Advil) is recommended. 
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be effective. Acetaminophen works faster than 
ibuprofen, but the effects of ibuprofen last longer.</li> 
<li>For adolescents age 12 years and older, sumaptriptan (Imitrex) nasal spray 
is recommended.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Migraine Prevention for Children.</i> Non-medication methods, including 
biofeedback and muscle relaxation techniques may be helpful. If these methods 
fail, then preventive drugs may be used, although evidence is weak on the 
effectiveness of standard migraine preventive drugs in children.</p> 
<h3>Withdrawing from Medications</h3> 
<p>If medication overuse causes rebound migraines develop, the patients cannot 
recover without stopping the drugs. (If caffeine is the culprit, a person may 
need only to reduce coffee or tea drinking to a reasonable level, not 
necessarily stop drinking it altogether.) The patient can usually stop abruptly 
or gradually. The patient should expect the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Most headache drugs can be stopped abruptly, but the patient should talk 
to their doctor first. Certain non-headache medications, such as anti-anxiety 
drugs or beta-blockers, require gradual withdrawal under medical supervision.
</li> 
<li>If the patient chooses to taper off standard headache medications, 
withdrawal should be completed within three days.</li> 
<li>The patient may take other pain medicines during the first days. Examples 
of drugs that may be used include dihydroergotamine (with or without 
metoclopramide), NSAIDs (in mild cases), corticosteroids, or valproate.</li> 
<li>The patient must expect their headache to get worse after they stop taking 
their medications, no matter which method they use. Most people feel better 
within 2 weeks, although headache symptoms can persist up to 16 weeks (and in 
rare cases even longer).</li> 
<li>If the symptoms do not respond to treatment and cause severe nausea and 
vomiting, the patient may need to be hospitalized.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Medications for Treating Migraine Attacks 
<p>Many different medications are used to treat migraines. However, the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically approved only the following 
types of drugs for treating migraine attacks:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Non-prescription drugs: Excedrin Migraine, Advil Migraine, Motrin Migraine 
Pain</li> 
<li>Prescription drugs: Triptans and ergotamine</li> </ul> 
<p>Other types of drugs, including opioids and barbiturates, are sometimes 
prescribed off-label for migraine treatment. Opioids and barbiturates have not 
been approved by the FDA for migraine relief, and they can be addictive.</p> 
<p>All FDA-approved migraine treatments are approved only for adults. No 
migraine products have officially been approved for use in children.</p> 
<h3>Pain Relievers</h3> 
<p>Some patients with mild migraines respond well to over-the-counter (OTC) 
painkillers, particularly if they take the medicine at the very first sign of 
an attack. OTC pain relievers, (also called analgesics), include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), 
naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin. The FDA-approved migraine products Advil 
Migraine and Motrin Migraine Pain both contain ibuprofen.</li> 
<li>Acetaminophen (Tylenol). The FDA-approved migraine product Excedrin 
Migraine contains acetaminophen, as well as aspirin and caffeine.</li> </ul> 
<p>There are also prescription-only NSAIDs. These include diclofenac 
(Cataflam), which is taken by mouth, and ketorolac (Toradol), which is given by 
injection.</p> 
<p><em>NSAID Side Effects</em>. High dosages and long-term use of NSAIDs can 
increase the risk for heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach 
bleeding. Aspirin does not increase the risk for heart problems, but it can 
cause other NSAID-related side effects.</p> 
<h3>Triptans</h3> 
<p>Triptans (also referred to as serotonin agonists) were the first drugs 
specifically developed for use against migraine. They are the most important 
migraine drugs currently available. They help maintain serotonin levels in the 
brain, and so specifically target one of the major components in the migraine 
process.</p> 
<p>Triptans are recommended as first-line drugs for adult patients with 
moderate-to-severe migraines when NSAIDs are not effective. Triptans have the 
following benefits:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>They are effective for most patients with migraine, as well as patients 
with combination tension and migraine headaches.</li> 
<li>They do not have the sedative effect of other migraine drugs.</li> 
<li>Withdrawal after overuse appears to be shorter and less severe than with 
other migraine medications</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Sumatriptan.</em> Sumatriptan (Imitrex) has the longest track record 
and is the most studied of all triptans. It is available as a fast-dissolving 
pill, nasal spray, or injection. Injected sumatriptan works the fastest of all 
the triptans and is the most effective, but it can cause pain at the injection 
site. The nasal spray form bypasses the stomach and is absorbed more quickly 
than the oral form. Some patients report relief as soon as 15 minutes after 
administration. The spray tends to work less well when a person has nasal 
congestion from cold or allergy. It may also leave a bad taste. Sumatriptan is 
effective for many patients, but headache recurs in 20 - 40% of people within 
24 hours after taking the drug.</p> 
<p>In 2008, the FDA approved a drug (Treximet) that combines in one pill both 
sumatriptan and the anti-inflammatory pain reliever naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). 
Some studies have found that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen works 
better for migraine relief than either drug alone.</p> 
<p><em>Other Triptans</em>. Newer triptans include almotriptan (Axert), 
zolmitriptan (Zomig), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), frovatriptan 
(Frova), and eletriptan (Relpax). Comparison studies with sumatriptan suggest 
that some of the newer drugs may have fewer side effects and may be better for 
providing immediate, sustained, and consistent pain relief. Triptans are also 
being investigated for prevention under certain circumstances, such as 
menstrual migraines, but benefits appear limited.</p> 
<p>Although triptans, (like all migraine medications), are approved only for 
adults, researchers are investigating zolmitriptan for treating migraines in 
adolescents.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects</em>. Side effects of triptans may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tingling and numbness in the toes</li> 
<li>Sensations of warmth</li> 
<li>Discomfort in the ear, nose, and throat</li> 
<li>Nausea</li> 
<li>Drowsiness</li> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Muscle weakness</li> 
<li>Heaviness, pain, or both in the chest. (About 40% of patients taking 
sumatriptan experience these symptoms, and they are major factors in 
discontinuing the drug. Newer drugs, such as almotriptan, produce fewer chest 
symptoms.)</li> 
<li>Rapid heart rate</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Complications of Triptans</em>. The following are potentially serious 
problems.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Complications of heart and circulation. Triptans narrow (constrict) blood 
vessels. Because of this effect, spasms in the blood vessels may occur and 
cause serious side effects, including stroke and heart attack. Such events are 
rare, but patients with an existing history or risk factors for these 
conditions should generally avoid triptans.</li> 
<li>Serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening condition 
that occurs from an excess of the brain chemical serotonin. Triptan drugs used 
to treat migraine, as well as certain types of antidepressant medications, can 
increase serotonin levels. These antidepressant drugs include serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) -- such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), 
and sertraline (Zoloft) -- and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs), such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). It 
is very important that patients not combine a triptan drug with a SSRI or SNRI 
drug. Serotonin syndrome is most likely to occur when starting or increasing 
the dose of a triptan or antidepressant drug. Symptoms include restlessness, 
hallucinations, rapid heartbeat, tremors, increased body temperature, diarrhea, 
nausea, and vomiting. You should seek immediate medical care if you have these 
symptoms.</li> </ul> 
<p>The following people should avoid triptans or take them with caution and 
only with the advisement of a doctor:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anyone with a history or any risk factors for stroke, uncontrolled 
diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease.</li> 
<li>People taking antidepressants that increase serotonin levels.</li> 
<li>Children and adolescents. They may be safe, but controlled studies are 
needed to confirm this. (Triptans should not, in any case, be the first-line 
treatment for children.)</li> 
<li>People with basilar or hemiplegic migraines. (Triptans are not indicated 
for these migraineurs.)</li> 
<li>There is no evidence to date of any higher risk for birth defects in 
pregnant women who take triptans. Still, women should be cautious about taking 
any medications during pregnancy and discuss any possible adverse effects with 
their doctors.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Ergotamine (Ergot)</h3> 
<p>Drugs containing ergotamine (commonly called ergots) constrict smooth 
muscles, including those in blood vessels, and are useful for migraine. They 
were the first anti-migraine drugs available. Ergotamine is available by 
prescription in the following preparations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot derivative. It is administered as a 
nasal spray form (Migranal) or by injection, which can be performed at home.
</li> 
<li>Ergotamine is available tablets taken by mouth, tablets taken under the 
tongue (sublingual), and rectal suppositories. Some of the tablet forms of 
ergotamine contain caffeine.</li> </ul> 
<p>Ergotamine's role since the introduction of triptans is now less certain. 
Only the rectal forms of ergotamine are superior to rectal triptans. Injected, 
oral, and nasal-spray forms are all inferior to the triptans. Ergotamine may 
still be helpful for patients with status migrainous or those with frequent 
recurring headaches.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects</em>. Side effects of ergotamine include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nausea</li> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Tingling sensations</li> 
<li>Muscle cramps</li> 
<li>Chest or abdominal pain</li> </ul> 
<p>The following are potentially serious problems:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Toxicity. Ergotamine is toxic at high levels.</li> 
<li>Adverse effects on blood vessels. Ergot can cause persistent blood vessel 
contractions, which may pose a danger for people with heart disease or risk 
factors for heart attack or stroke.</li> 
<li>Internal scarring (fibrosis). Scarring can occur in the areas around the 
lungs, heart, or kidneys. It is often reversible if the drug is stopped.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The following patients should avoid ergots:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pregnant women. Ergots can cause miscarriage.</li> 
<li>People over age 60.</li> 
<li>Patients with serious, chronic health problems, particularly those of the 
heart and circulation.</li> </ul> 
<p>Ergotamine can interact with other medications, such as antifungal drugs 
and some antibiotics. All ergotamine products approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) contain a &quot;black box&quot; warning in the 
prescription label explaining these drug interactions. In 2007, the FDA pulled 
15 unapproved older ergotamine products off the market, in part because they 
lacked this warning label. The five FDA-approved ergotamine products that 
remain on the market are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Migergot suppository (marketed by G and W Labs)</li> 
<li>Ergotamine Tartrate and Caffeine tablets (marketed by Mikart and West Ward)
</li> 
<li>Cafergot tablets (marketed by Sandoz)</li> 
<li>Ergomar sublingual tablets (marketed by Rosedale Therapeutics)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Opioids</h3> 
<p>If the pain is very severe and does respond to other drugs, doctors may try 
painkillers containing opioids. Opioid drugs include morphine, codeine, 
meperidine (Demerol), and oxycodone (Oxycontin)]. Butorphanol is an opioid in 
nasal spray form that may be useful as a rescue treatment when others fail.</p> 
<p>Opioids are not approved for migraine treatment and should not be used as 
first-line therapy. Nevertheless, many opioid products are prescribed to 
patients with migraine, sometimes with dangerous results. In 2007, following 
reports of several drug-related deaths, the Food and Drug Administration warned 
that the cancer pain pill fentanyl (Fentora) should not be used to treat 
patients with migraine or others conditions for which the drug is not 
specifically approved.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects</em>. Side effects for all opioids include drowsiness, 
impaired judgment, nausea, and constipation. There is a risk for addiction, and 
these drugs can become ineffective with long-term use for chronic migraines. 
Doctors should not prescribe opioids to patients at risk for drug abuse, 
including those with personality or psychiatric disorders.</p> 
<h3>Drugs Used for Nausea and Vomiting</h3> 
<p>Metoclopramide (Reglan) is used in combinations with other drugs to treat 
the nausea and vomiting that occurs with other drugs and with migraine itself. 
Metoclopramide and other anti-nausea drugs, such as domperidone (Motilium), may 
help the intestine better absorb migraine medications.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Medications for Preventing Migraine Attacks 
<p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved four drugs for prevention of 
migraine:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Propanolol (Inderal)</li> 
<li>Timolol (Blacadrene)</li> 
<li>Divalproex sodium (Depakote)</li> 
<li>Topiramate (Topamax)</li> </ul> 
<p>Propanolol and timolol are beta-blocker drugs. Divalproex and topiramate 
are anti-seizure drugs. Many other drugs are also being used or investigated 
for preventing migraines.</p> 
<h3>Beta-Blockers</h3> 
<p>Beta-blockers are usually prescribed to reduce high blood pressure. Some 
beta-blockers, however, are also useful in reducing the frequency of migraine 
attacks and their severity when they occur. Propranolol (Inderal) and timolol 
(Blocadren) have been approved specifically for prevention of migraine. 
Metoprolol (Toprol), atenolol (Tenormin), and nadolol (Corgard) are also being 
studied for migraine prevention.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects</em>. Side effects may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fatigue and lethargy are common.</li> 
<li>Some people experience vivid dreams and nightmares, depression, and memory 
loss.</li> 
<li>Dizziness and lightheadedness may occur upon standing.</li> 
<li>Exercise capacity may be reduced.</li> 
<li>Other side effects may include cold extremities, asthma, decreased heart 
function, gastrointestinal problems, and sexual dysfunction.</li> </ul> 
<p>If side effects occur, the patient should call a doctor, but it is 
extremely important not to stop the drug abruptly. Some evidence suggests that 
people with migraines who have had a stroke should avoid beta-blockers.</p> 
<h3>Anti-Seizure Drugs</h3> 
<p>Anti-seizure drugs, also called anti-epileptic drugs or anticonvulsants, 
affect the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps prevent 
nerve cells from over-firing. GABA may also have a role in migraines. These 
drugs are commonly used for treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder. 
Anti-seizure drugs are more expensive than other drugs. They also have 
significant side effects. Divalproex sodium (Depakote) and topiramate (Topamax) 
are the only anti-seizure drugs that are approved for migraine prevention. 
However, if patients do not respond to either of these drugs, doctors may try 
other types of anti-seizure medications.</p> 
<p><em>Divalproex Sodium (Depakote).</em> Divalproex sodium (Depakote) was 
first approved in 1996 for migraine prevention. A once-a-day formulation of 
divalproex (Depakote ER) was approved in 2000. Doctors sometimes prescribe a 
similar drug, valproate (Depakene). Pregnant patients should not use these 
drugs, as they may cause birth defects.</p> 
<p><em>Topiramate (Topamax).</em> In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration 
approved topiramate for prevention of migraines in adults. Studies from 2006 
indicated that the drug works well when used on a long-term basis. Patients in 
these studies experienced significantly fewer migraines for up to 14 months. 
Topiramate's most common side effect is a tingling sensation in the arms and 
legs. Weight loss is also a side effect. In clinical trials, patients lost an 
average of 3.8% of their body weight.</p> 
<p><em>Other Anti-Seizure Drugs Under Investigation</em>. Researchers are 
studying other types of anti-seizure drugs for migraine prevention. These 
include levetiracetam (Keppra), gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), 
zonisamide (Zonegran), and tiagabine (Gabitril).</p> 
<p>Side Effects. Anti-seizure medication's side effects vary by drug but may 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li> 
<li>Diarrhea</li> 
<li>Cramps</li> 
<li>Hair loss</li> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Sleepiness</li> 
<li>Blurred vision</li> 
<li>Weight gain</li> 
<li>Valproate and divalproex can cause serious side effects of inflammation of 
the pancreas (pancreatitis) and damage to the liver</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tricyclic and Other Antidepressants</h3> 
<p>Amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), a tricyclic antidepressant drug, has been 
used for many years as a first-line treatment for migraine prevention. It may 
work best for patients who also have depression or insomnia. Tricyclics can 
have significant side effects, including disturbances in heart rhythms, and can 
be fatal in overdose. Although other tricyclic antidepressants may have fewer 
side effects than amitritpyline, they do not appear to be particularly 
effective for migraine prevention.</p> 
<p>Researchers have investigated newer types of antidepressants, including 
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac). However, 
studies to date do not indicate that SSRIs are helpful for migraine prevention.
</p> 
<h3>Investigational Treatments for Preventing Migraines</h3> 
<p><em>Muscle Relaxants</em>. Botulinum toxin A (Botox) injection, a common 
wrinkle treatment, causes small muscles to relax. It is being studied as a 
preventive approach for reducing the frequency of migraine attacks and 
patients' reliance on pain medications. To date, there is still no proven 
benefit. More research is needed.</p> 
<p><em>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors</em>. Commonly used for 
treating high blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 
block the production of the protein angiotensin, which constricts blood vessels 
and may be involved in migraine. Studies using the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 
(Prinivil, Zestril) have reported significant reduction in migraine attacks.</p>
<p><em>Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers.</em> Angiotensin-receptor blockers 
(ARBs) are another type of high blood pressure medications. ARBs have actions 
similar to ACE inhibitors, but may have fewer side effects. In 
placebo-controlled studies, the ARB candesartan (Atacand) helped reduce 
migraine frequency.</p> 
<p><em>Neurostimulation Devices</em>. Researchers are investigating a 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device to help stop migraines before 
they occur. The hair dryer-size device is held to the back of the head and 
delivers quick magnetic pulses. The device is used when a patient experiences 
the first signs of a migraine. Other types of nerve stimulation devices are 
also under investigation.</p> 
<p><em>Nasal Devices</em>. New types of nasal sprays and powders are being 
researched. Some of them use capsaicin, the chemical found in cayenne peppers, 
to help relieve pain.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Non-Drug Treatments and Lifestyle 
Changes 
<p>There are several ways to prevent migraine attacks. You should try a 
healthy diet, the right amount of sleep, and non-drug approaches (such as 
biofeedback) first for prevention.</p> 
<h3>Behavioral Treatments</h3> 
<p>Behavioral techniques that reduce stress and empower the patient may help 
some people with migraines. They generally include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Biofeedback therapy</li> 
<li>Relaxation techniques</li> 
<li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</li> </ul> 
<p>Behavioral methods may help counteract the tendency for muscle contraction 
and uneven blood flow associated with some headaches. They may be particularly 
beneficial for children, adolescents, and pregnant and nursing women, and 
anyone who cannot take most migraine medications. Studies generally find that 
these techniques work best when used in combination with medications.</p> 
<p><i>Biofeedback.</i> Many studies have demonstrated that biofeedback is 
effective for reducing migraine headache frequency. Biofeedback training 
teaches the patient to monitor and modify physical responses, such as muscle 
tension, using special instruments for feedback.</p> 
<p><em>Relaxation Therapy</em>. Relaxation therapy techniques include 
relaxation response, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and deep 
breathing. Muscle relaxation techniques are simple and easy to learn, and can 
be effective. Some patients may also find that relaxation techniques combined 
with applying a cold compress to the forehead may help provide some pain relief 
during attacks. Some commercially available products use a pad containing a gel 
that cools the skin for several hours.</p> 
<p><i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</i> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
teaches patients how to recognize and cope with stressors in their life. It can 
help patients understand how their thoughts and behavior patterns may affect 
their symptoms, and how to change the way the body responds to anticipated 
pain. CBT may be included with stress management techniques. Research indicates 
that CBT is most effective when combined with relaxation training or 
biofeedback.</p> 
<h3>Acupuncture</h3> 
<p>Acupuncture is a Chinese medicine technique that uses thin needles to 
stimulate specific points aligned with energy pathways in the body. Studies 
have showed mixed results on the benefits of acupuncture for preventing 
migraine.</p> 
<h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3> 
<p>Making a few minor changes in your lifestyle can make your migraines more 
bearable. Improving sleep habits is important for everyone, and especially 
those with headaches. What you eat also has a huge impact on migraines, so 
dietary changes can be extremely beneficial, too.</p> 
<p><i>Avoid Food Triggers.</i> Avoiding foods that trigger migraine is an 
important preventive measure. Common food triggers include monosodium glutamate 
(MSG), processed lunch meats that contain nitrates, dried fruits that contain 
sulfites, aged cheese, alcohol and red wine, chocolate, and caffeine. However, 
people's responses to triggers differ. Keeping a headache diary that tracks 
diet and headache onset can help identify individual food triggers.</p> 
<p><em>Eat Regularly.</em> Eating regularly is important to prevent low blood 
sugar. People with migraines who fast periodically for religious reasons might 
consider taking preventive medications.</p> 
<p><em>Stay Physically Active</em>. Exercise is certainly helpful for 
relieving stress. An analysis of several studies reported that aerobic exercise 
in particular might help prevent migraines. It is important, however, to warm 
up gradually before beginning a session, since sudden, vigorous exercise might 
actually precipitate or aggravate a migraine attack.</p> 
<p><em>Limit Estrogen-Containing Medications</em>. Medications that contain 
estrogen, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, may 
trigger migraines or make them worse. Talk to your doctor about whether you 
should stop taking these types of medications or reduce the dosage.</p> 
<h3>Herbs and Supplements</h3> 
<p>Manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need Food 
and Drug Administration approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, 
herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the 
potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been several 
reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. 
Patients should always check with their doctors before using any herbal 
remedies or dietary supplements.</p> 
<p><i>Riboflavin (Vitamin B2).</i> Some studies have found that people who 
take vitamin B2 experience a reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks 
(although not on duration or severity). Vitamin B2 is generally safe, although 
some people taking high doses develop diarrhea.</p> 
<p><i>Magnesium Supplements.</i> Some studies have reported a higher rate of 
magnesium deficiencies in some patients with migraine, such as those with 
menstrual migraines. Magnesium helps relax blood vessels. Some patients report 
that magnesium supplements help provide relief.</p> 
<p><i>Feverfew.</i> Feverfew is the most studied herbal remedy for headaches 
and may help in some cases. However, like all effective headache remedies, 
overuse can cause a rebound effect.</p> 
<p><em>Fish Oil</em>. Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, which are 
found in fish oil, have anti-inflammatory and nerve protecting actions. These 
fatty acids can be found in oily fish, such as salmon, mackerel, or sardines. 
They can also be obtained in supplements of specific omega-3 compounds 
(DHA-EPA).</p> 
<p><em>Ginger.</em> In general, herbal medicines should never be used by 
children or pregnant or nursing women without medical counsel. One exception 
may be ginger, which has no side effects and can be eaten in powder or fresh 
form, as long as quantities are not excessive. Some people have reported less 
pain and frequency of migraines while taking ginger, and children can take it 
without danger. Ginger is also a popular home remedy for relieving nausea.</p>
