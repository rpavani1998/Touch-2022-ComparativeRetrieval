HEART ATTACKS BY REDUCING CLOTTING</p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CUTS COLON-CANCER DEATH RATE BY 50%</p>

<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MARKEDLY REDUCES CESAREAN SECTION</p> 
<p>5)&nbsp; IT IS CHEAP</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Why Take Ibuprofen </p> 
<p>1)&nbsp; it has a better reputation than aspirin among the non-medical 
public.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of this doctors are more likely to 
proscribe ibuprofen.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is inexpensive compared to the more 
exotic NSAIDS.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it works.&nbsp; {NSAIDS is the 
Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs--a family with over 20&nbsp;prescription 
members}&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<h1>Why Take Aspirin</h1> 
<p>1) it has been used for a longer period of time and has no major side 
effects other than intestinal bleeding, and this can be avoid quite effectively 
by taking coated aspirin, where they.</p> 
<p>2) it costs a fraction of Ibuprofen.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>3)&nbsp; those women taking aspirin regularly while pregnant have under 
one-forth the incident of caesarean section (5.6% versus 23.9% in a meta-study).
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>4)&nbsp; it lowers the incident of colon cancer approximately 50% (a 
retrospect study of over 600,000 people).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>5)&nbsp; it lowers the incident of breast cancer</p> 
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it dramatically lowers the incident of 
heart attacks&mdash;so much so that doctors routinely recommend taking 
one-a-day for those who are in the high risk group.&nbsp; </p> 
<h2>&nbsp; </h2> 
<h2>Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h2> 
<p>&nbsp; Both Ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because 
they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 MG or more 
for aspirin, 400 &amp; 800 MG for Ibuprofen).&nbsp; In one of the typical ploys 
to increase profits, Ibuprofen is touted as being less upsetting to the stomach 
and less likely to cause bleeding.&nbsp; However, Ibuprofen is coated, and the 
comparison is to uncoated aspirin.&nbsp;&nbsp; When comparing likes to likes 
(coated versus coated) there is no difference.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<h3>Costs </h3> 
<p>&nbsp; Aspirin can be purchased for a penny a piece in a discount store, 
and large pharmacies carry a low-price brand in addition to Bayer.&nbsp; There 
is no advantage to buying a more expensive brand of acetasalasylic acid.&nbsp; 
Ibuprofen sells for at least 10 times the price per dose when compared to those 
carried by a discount store.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Pain Relief</h2> 
<p>&nbsp; In general pain diminishes over time, that even acetopmetaphin seems 
to work.&nbsp; The family of NSAID (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) is 
effective for pain resulting from swelling by modestly reducing swelling.&nbsp; 
The expectations greatly exceed the reality.&nbsp; They lack any effect upon 
the system of nerve sensor resulting in pain&mdash;an ability of the opiates.
&nbsp;Most pains diminish within an hour&mdash;whether a drug is taken or not. 
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<h2>Ways the Two Are Essentially Equal</h2> 
<p>First, they work.&nbsp; Second, they both cause stomach bleeding.&nbsp; 
Third, on a dose basis they equally lower prostaglandins, a blood factor 
involved in clotting and by this mechanism they reduce blood clots and 
consequently the incident of strokes caused by a blood clot and heart attacks 
so caused.&nbsp; About 85% of the strokes are a result of a blood clot and 60% 
of the heart attacks.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b></b></p> <b>The jury is in, the 2nd most commoly prescribed drug for </b>
<br><b> &nbsp; <br>
inflamation doesn't work, and it causes thousands of <br>

&nbsp;<br>

damage (mostly by those who take more thinking it is as safe <br>

<br> <br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Background: </strong>Acetaminophen is the most widely used 
pharmaceutical analgesic and antipyretic agent in the United States and the 
world; it is contained in more than 100 products. As such, acetaminophen is one 
of the most common pharmaceuticals associated with both intentional and 
accidental poisoning.</p> 
<p>Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is well recognized. Acetaminophen also 
is known as paracetamol and<em>N</em>-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP). It is found 
in the United States as 325-mg and 500-mg immediate-release tablets and as a 
650-mg extended-release preparation. Various children's chewable, suspension, 
and elixir formulations of acetaminophen also are available. Furthermore, 
acetaminophen is found as a component of combination drugs such as 
propoxyphene-acetaminophen (eg, Darvocet) and oxycodone-acetaminophen (eg, 
Percocet).</p> 
<p><strong>Pathophysiology: </strong>The maximum daily dose of APAP is 4 g in 
adults and 90 mg/kg in children. The toxic dose of APAP after a single acute 
ingestion is 150 mg/kg or approximately 7 g in adults, although the at-risk 
dose may be lower in persons with alcoholism and other susceptible individuals. 
When dosing recommendations are followed, the risk of hepatotoxicity is 
extremely small.</p> 
<p>Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and 
metabolized by conjugation in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are 
eliminated in the urine.</p> 
<p>In acute overdose or when maximum daily dose is exceeded over a prolonged 
period, the normal pathways of metabolism become saturated. Excess APAP is then 
metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase P450 system to a toxic 
metabolite,<em>N</em>-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI). NAPQI has an 
extremely short half-life and is rapidly conjugated with glutathione, a 
sulfhydryl donor, and removed from the system. Under conditions of excessive 
NAPQI formation or reduced glutathione stores, NAPQI is free to covalently bind 
to vital proteins and the lipid bilayer of hepatocytes; this results in 
hepatocellular death and subsequent centrilobular liver necrosis.</p> 
<p>The antidote for APAP poisoning is <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is 
theorized to work by a number of protective mechanisms. Early after overdose, 
NAC prevents the formation and accumulation of NAPQI. NAC increases glutathione 
stores, combines directly with NAPQI as a glutathione substitute, and enhances 
sulfate conjugation. NAC also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve 
microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. Vasodilating 
effects decrease morbidity and mortality once hepatotoxicity is well 
established.</p> 
<p>NAC is most effective when administered within 8 hours of ingestion. When 
indicated, however, NAC should be administered regardless of time since the 
overdose. Therapy with NAC has been shown to decrease mortality rates in 
late-presenting patients with fulminant hepatic failure (in the absence of 
acetaminophen in the serum).</p> 
<p><strong>Frequency: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>In the US: </strong>Acetaminophen is one of the most common agents 
in overdose reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. 
APAP toxicity is the most common cause of hepatic failure requiring liver 
transplantation in the United States and Great Britain.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Mortality/Morbidity: </strong>The majority of patients with APAP 
overdose survive with supportive care in conjunction with antidotal therapy. If 
correctly treated in a timely manner, most patients do not suffer significant 
sequelae.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Case series report that fewer than 4% of patients who suffer severe 
hepatotoxicity develop hepatic failure; fatalities or liver transplantation 
occur in less than one half of these patients.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients with malnutrition, AIDS, chronic ethanol abuse, or anorexia 
nervosa may be at increased risk for morbidity because of deficient glutathione 
stores and inadequate detoxification of NAPQI. Patients with enhanced ability 
to make NAPQI because of induction of the P450 system, specifically cyp2E1, may 
be at increased risk of morbidity; these patients include those taking agents 
known to induce this enzyme activity, such as rifampin, phenobarbital, 
isoniazid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or patients with chronic ethanol abuse.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Pediatric patients younger than 5 years appear to fare better than adults 
after APAP poisoning, perhaps owing to a greater capacity to conjugate 
acetaminophen, enhanced detoxification of NAPQI, or greater glutathione stores. 
However, since no controlled studies have supported any alternative pediatric 
therapy, treatment in children should not be different than in adults.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>History: </strong>The course of acetaminophen toxicity generally is 
divided into 4 phases. Evidence of end-organ (hepatic, renal) toxicity often is 
delayed 24-48 hours postingestion.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Because antidotal therapy is most efficacious when initiated within 8 
hours postingestion, the clinician must attempt to obtain an accurate history 
of the time(s) of ingestion, the quantity and formulation of acetaminophen 
ingested, and any co-ingestants (eg, diphenhydramine, other anticholinergic 
drugs, opioids), which may delay absorption.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>However, as a patient's history often is inaccurate, the serum 
acetaminophen concentration is important for diagnosis and treatment, even in 
the absence of symptoms.</li> </ul>

<p><strong>Causes: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Production of acetaminophen's toxic metabolite, NAPQI, in excess of an 
adequate store of glutathione necessary to conjugate it, leads to NAPQI-induced 
hepatocellular necrosis and hepatic failure.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Additional mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced toxicity are postulated as 
well.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Lab Studies: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acetaminophen serum concentration </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>A serum acetaminophen concentration drawn 4 or more hours after a single 
ingestion may be plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram as a guide to 
recommended NAC therapy. Do not rely upon this nomogram following multiple 
acetaminophen ingestions, multiple ingestions such as those involving 
anticholinergics or opioids, extended release formulations, or chronic 
ingestions. Note that the Rumack-Matthew nomogram is a treatment nomogram and 
distinct from the Done nomogram, which serves to predict the severity of 
toxicity in salicylate poisoning.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Determine serum acetaminophen concentration in any intentional overdose 
because the history of acetaminophen ingestion may not be elicited, and 
manifestations of toxicity may not become evident until after treatment should 
have been initiated. (SeeSpecial Concerns for information regarding 
extended-relief acetaminophen.)</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Transaminase levels </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) begin 
to rise within 24 hours postingestion and peak at 48-72 hours.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Severe toxicity can be defined as AST or ALT greater than 1000 IU/L. </li>

<ul> 
<li>Serum glucose </li> </ul> </ul>

<li>Prothrombin time (PT) and bilirubin </li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Electrolytes and creatinine </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Look for anion gap acidosis to help rule out co-ingestion, metabolic 
disorder from vomiting, or liver failure (if subacute ingestion).</li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Renal failure has been shown to coexist with or, rarely, be independent of 
liver toxicity in overdose. One study indicated that this is more likely to 
occur in alcoholic persons. Renal failure usually is not observed acutely but 
rather within 2-3 days of overdose.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in females of childbearing age </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Acetaminophen crosses the placenta, and the fetal liver is able to 
elaborate NAPQI by 14 weeks of gestation.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Delay in treating pregnant patients with antidotal therapy is associated 
with fetal demise.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>A type and crossmatch should be drawn for the treatment of active bleeding 
in the face of coagulopathy.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Urinalysis: Proteinuria and hematuria may be seen with acute tubular 
necrosis (ATN), usually in conjunction with hepatic failure.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Arterial blood gas </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Poor prognosis is associated with an arterial pH less than 7.30 (which 
fails to correct with fluid administration) and serum creatinine greater than 
3.4 mg/dL.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>An arterial blood gas (ABG) should be drawn in patients with clinical or 
laboratory evidences of toxic overdose or altered mental status.</li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Imaging Studies: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>CT scan of the head </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>CT scan may reveal cerebral edema in patients with late presentation and 
encephalopathy.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Consider in patients with altered mental status. </li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Ultrasound </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Ultrasound may reveal mild hepatic enlargement in late presentation. </li> 
</ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If clinically indicated, this is usually an inpatient procedure. </li> 
</ul> </ul> 
<p><strong>Procedures: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gastric lavage </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Gastric lavage is controversial and has no proven efficacy in isolated 
acetaminophen overdose.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Consider in early presentation (&lt;1 h) following a multidrug ingestion 
with altered mental status or hemodynamic compromise.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<p><strong>Prehospital Care: </strong>Stabilize immediate life-threatening 
conditions and initiate supportive care.</p> 
<p><strong>Emergency Department Care: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Supportive therapy, including IV fluids, oxygen, and cardiac monitor </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Gastric decontamination </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Oral activated charcoal avidly adsorbs acetaminophen and should be 
administered if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion or later, 
especially if a GI motility-inhibiting co-ingestant may have been involved.</li>
</ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Administer oral activated charcoal if the time of ingestion is unknown, 
the patient ingested extended-relief acetaminophen, or possibility of a drug 
co-ingestion exists.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Administer <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, if indicated. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Assess for evidence of other life-threatening co-ingestions. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Consultations: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Medical toxicologist, available through consultation with a regional 
poison control center</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>This consultation is recommended if using IV NAC. </li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Consultation with a medical toxicologist also is recommended for patients 
who have a complicated or late presentation, hepatic or renal dysfunction, or a 
history of potentially toxic co-ingestants.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If fulminant hepatic failure is present, consult a hepatologist and 
transplant surgeon.</li> </ul> 
<p>Agents used in the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning include activated 
charcoal,<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, and antiemetics.</p> 
<p>Drug Category: <em>GI decontaminants</em> -- Emergency treatment in 
poisoning caused by drugs and chemicals. Network of pores present in activated 
charcoal adsorbs 100-1000 mg of drug per gram of charcoal. Does not dissolve in 
water.</p> 
<p><b>Drug Name </b></p> 
<p>Activated charcoal (Liqui-Char) -- DOC for patients presenting within 1-2 h 
postingestion or in cases where co-ingestants may delay gastric emptying or gut 
motility. Expect minimal benefit if administered &gt;4 h postingestion. </p> 
<br> 
<p><b>Adult Dose </b></p> 
<p>1 g/kg PO or 10 times the amount of drug ingested </p> <br>

<p><b>Pediatric Dose </b></p> 
<p>Administer as in adults </p> <br>

<p><b>Contraindications </b></p> 
<p>Documented hypersensitivity; poisoning or overdosage of mineral acids and 
alkalies; unprotected airway with absent gag reflex </p> <br>

<p><b>Interactions </b></p> 
<p>May inactivate ipecac syrup if used concomitantly; effectiveness of other 
medications decreases with coadministration; do not mix with sherbet, milk, or 
ice cream (decreases adsorptive properties) </p> <br>

<p><b>Pregnancy </b></p> 
<p>C - Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established. </p> <br>

<p><b>Precautions </b></p> 
<p>Not very effective in poisonings of ethanol, methanol, and iron salts; 
induce emesis before administering activated charcoal; after emesis with 
ipecac, patient may not tolerate activated charcoal for 1-2 h; can administer 
in early stages of gastric lavage; without sorbitol, gastric lavage returns are 
black; adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and aspiration if the airway 
is not secure; monitor for bowel sounds to minimize risk of charcoal ileus </p> 
<br> <br>

<p>Drug Category: <em>Antidote</em> -- May provide substrate for conjugation 
with the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen. Administer all doses, even if 
acetaminophen level has dropped below toxic range.</p> 
<p><b>Drug Name </b></p> 
<p><em>N</em>-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) -- DOC for prevention and treatment of 
acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Approved by the FDA for PO administration 
but is also administered IV, especially when PO NAC is not tolerated due to 
refractory vomiting. For maximum hepatoprotective effect, administer within 
8-24 h of acetaminophen ingestion. When given PO, dilute in chilled juice or 
cola to a 5% solution. May be dripped slowly via nasogastric tube if severe 
nausea threatens administration. Repeat dose if vomiting occurs within 1 h of 
NAC administration. When administered IV, infuse over 1 h through a 0.2 micron 
Millipore pyrogen filter. </p> <br>

<p><b>Adult Dose </b></p> 
<p>140 mg/kg PO loading dose, followed by 70 mg/kg q4h for 17 additional doses 
(total 1330 mg/kg over 72 h)<br>
140 mg/kg IV loading dose, followed by 70 
mg/kg q4h for 12 doses (total 980 mg/kg over 48 h); infuse over 1 h through a 
micropore filter (consult with a regional poison center and/or medical 
toxicologist)<br>
Some centers use a 20-h treatment protocol (consult regional 
poison center and/or medical toxicologist) </p> <br>

<p><b>Pediatric Dose </b></p> 
<p>Administer as in adults </p> <br>

<p><b>Contraindications </b></p> 
<p>Documented hypersensitivity </p> <br>

<p><b>Interactions </b></p> 
<p>None reported </p> <br>

<p><b>Pregnancy </b></p> 
<p>A - Safe in pregnancy </p> <br>

<p><b>Precautions </b></p> 
<p>Adverse effects associated with PO NAC include nausea and vomiting, 
probably induced by its foul &quot;rotten egg&quot; odor and, rarely, 
clinically insignificant sulfhemoglobinemia; only 1 case of an anaphylactoid 
reaction following PO NAC has been reported; IV NAC may cause various degrees 
of infusion rate-dependent erythema at infusion site, urticaria, fever, and 
bronchospasm (anaphylactoid reaction); respond to antihistamines and 
epinephrine; may be limited by slowing the infusion rate </p> <br>
<br>

<p>Drug Category: <em>Antiemetics</em> -- Emesis frequently is associated with 
acetaminophen toxicity and is a common consequence of activated charcoal and 
NAC administration. For these reasons, antiemetic therapy often is necessary to 
allow successful administration of NAC.</p> 
<p>Antiemetics that do not decrease gastric motility or significantly alter 
mental status are the DOC; anticholinergic drugs, such as prochlorperazine 
(Compazine) are not considered beneficial, in part because of their propensity 
to cause both of these effects. Phenothiazines also may add to the toxicity 
associated with other anticholinergic drugs, which are often in APAP-containing 
formulations.</p> 
<p><b>Drug Name </b></p> 
<p>Metoclopramide (Reglan) -- Functions as antiemetic by blocking dopamine 
receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of CNS. Is generally DOC due to 
lower cost than ondansetron (Zofran). </p> <br>

<p><b>Adult Dose </b></p> 
<p>10-20 mg IV, not to exceed 1 mg/kg; not to exceed 3 mg/kg/d divided prn </p>
<br> 
<p><b>Pediatric Dose </b></p> 
<p>1-2 mg/kg total dose </p> <br>

<p><b>Contraindications </b></p> 
<p>Documented hypersensitivity </p> <br>

<p><b>Interactions </b></p> 
<p>May antagonize effects of metoclopramide; opiate analgesics may increase 
metoclopramide toxicity in CNS </p> <br>

<p><b>Pregnancy </b></p> 
<p>B - Usually safe but benefits must outweigh the risks. </p> <br>

<p><b>Precautions </b></p> 
<p>Caution in history of mental illness and Parkinson disease; adverse effects 
include drowsiness, hypotension, and acute dystonia, especially at high doses; 
may increase frequency of seizure in individuals with epilepsy </p> <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>Drug Name </b></p> 
<p>Ondansetron (Zofran) -- Selective 5-HT3receptor antagonist that blocks 
serotonin both peripherally and centrally. Considered potentially more 
effective than metoclopramide; in addition, adverse effects are less common. 
</p> <br>

<p><b>Adult Dose </b></p> 
<p>0.15 mg/kg or 8 mg IV q8h, not to exceed 3 doses </p> <br>

<p><b>Pediatric Dose </b></p> 
<p>0.15 mg/kg IV q 8h, not to exceed 3 doses </p> <br>

<p><b>Contraindications </b></p> 
<p>Documented hypersensitivity </p> <br>

<p><b>Interactions </b></p> 
<p>Although cytochrome P-450 inducers (barbiturates, rifampin, carbamazepine, 
and phenytoin) may potentially change half-life and clearance of ondansetron, 
dosage adjustment is not usually required </p> <br>

<p><b>Pregnancy </b></p> 
<p>B - Usually safe but benefits must outweigh the risks. </p> <br>

<p><b>Precautions </b></p> 
<p>Medication is to be administered for prevention of nausea and vomiting, not 
for rescue of nausea and vomiting </p> <br>

<p><strong>Further Inpatient Care: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Admit patients for NAC therapy if they have an acetaminophen level 
associated with potential toxicity, as suggested by the Rumack-Matthew 
treatment nomogram.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Unless coexisting toxicologic, medical, or psychiatric issues are present, 
patients with acetaminophen toxicity may be admitted and treated on a general 
medical floor.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Admit patients to an ICU setting if they show signs of significant 
hepatotoxicity; hepatic failure; or other potentially life-threatening, 
coexisting, toxicologic, or medical issues.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Further Outpatient Care: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients who do not have a suggestive history or acetaminophen level 
associated with potential toxicity, as determined by the Rumack-Matthew 
nomogram, may be discharged or transferred for psychiatric evaluation if 
indicated.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Transfer: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Transfer patients with fulminant hepatic failure to a facility capable of 
intensive care monitoring and evaluation for potential transplantation.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Patient Education: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Advise patients of the potential risk associated with the inappropriate 
use of acetaminophen, which commonly is considered an innocuous 
over-the-counter drug.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Educate parents of the proper acetaminophen dosing for children and the 
danger associated with misusing various acetaminophen preparations (eg, infant 
suspension vs pediatric elixir, pediatric vs adult suppositories). Because 
infant suspension (drops) is a more concentrated formulation than the elixir 
(100 mg/mL vs 32 mg/mL), this can be a potential source of therapeutic error. 
Parents always should be given clear dose and formulation instructions.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Educate patients of the increased potential for renal toxicity associated 
with concurrent acetaminophen and NSAID analgesic use or chronic alcoholism.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Medical/Legal Pitfalls: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>NAC-activated charcoal interaction </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>In vitro studies have shown that NAC is adsorbed to activated charcoal and 
the administration of activated charcoal reduced total NAC absorption by 39% in 
human volunteers, as measured by serum NAC levels. Prospective evaluation of 
patients treated with activated charcoal and NAC, however, indicated no adverse 
outcome associated with this treatment.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Despite binding to NAC, activated charcoal adsorbs acetaminophen more 
avidly. Therefore, although charcoal may decrease the bioavailability of NAC, 
this decrease is clinically inconsequential.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Finally, activated charcoal administration may prevent significant 
acetaminophen absorption and obviate the need for NAC.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Super-loading doses of NAC have shown to be of no greater clinical benefit 
than the current recommended loading dose.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Administer activated charcoal and draw a 4-hour serum acetaminophen 
concentration if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion, presents 
later after co-ingestion with a substance that could delay systemic absorption, 
or the history is unclear.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Draw an acetaminophen level if the patient presents later than 4 hours 
after ingestion. Administer NAC if presentation is close to 8 hours 
postingestion or if the acetaminophen level will not be available within 8 
hours postingestion.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>NAC may be staggered with activated charcoal if multiple doses of 
activated charcoal are necessary for treatment of a co-ingestant.</li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>For greatest efficacy, administer NAC within 8 hours of ingestion; 
however, a later presentation should not preclude its administration if the 
history or presentation suggests potential toxicity. Failure to administer NAC 
because of late presentation could be considered medically and legally risky.
</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Failure to consider and evaluate for possible co-ingestants or to consider 
the effects of decreased GI motility on absorption of APAP; the treatment 
nomogram does not pertain to these situations. Therefore, in the absence of 
good data on multidrug or co-ingestions involving APAP, administer NAC as early 
as possible and consult the regional poison control center for guidance on a 
treatment regimen.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<p><strong>Special Concerns: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chronic ingestion </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If a patient presents with ingestion of supratherapeutic doses of 
acetaminophen over hours or days, evaluate for presence of hepatotoxicity and 
unmetabolized acetaminophen.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Begin NAC therapy if the patient has elevated AST and ALT and a measurable 
acetaminophen concentration.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Consult the regional poison control center for guidance on a treatment 
regimen.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Late presentation </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If a patient presents 8-24 hours or longer postingestion, evaluate for 
ongoing hepatotoxicity and initiate NAC therapy if indicated.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>NAC administration in cases of hepatic failure has been associated with 
decreased incidence of cerebral edema and improved survival.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Extended-relief acetaminophen (Tylenol ER) </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>The Tylenol ER preparation became available in 1995. The tablet is 
composed of acetaminophen 325 mg in immediate release form with a matrix of 
acetaminophen 325 mg formulated for slow release. Some alteration of the 
elimination kinetics of this preparation may affect the ability of the 
Rumack-Matthew nomogram to guide treatment. Several studies show that 
eliminations of extended and immediate-release acetaminophen are nearly 
identical after 4 hours. However, some case reports have documented 
acetaminophen levels falling above the treatment nomogram line as late as 11-14 
hours postingestion of the extended-release preparation.</li> </ul> </ul> 
<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Check 4-, 6-, and 8-hour acetaminophen concentration levels. Begin NAC 
therapy if any level crosses above the nomogram treatment line. If the 6-hour 
level is greater than the 4-hour level, begin NAC therapy. More prolonged 
monitoring of levels may be necessary if the patient has food in the stomach or 
co-ingestants that delay gastric emptying. Consult the regional poison control 
center for guidance in evaluation and treatment regimen.</li> </ul> </ul>

<strong>Background: </strong>Acetaminophen is the most widely used 
pharmaceutical analgesic and antipyretic agent in the United States and the 
world; it is contained in more than 100 products. As such, acetaminophen is one 
of the most common pharmaceuticals associated with both intentional and 
accidental poisoning.
<p>Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is well recognized. Acetaminophen also 
is known as paracetamol and<em>N</em>-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP). It is found 
in the United States as 325-mg and 500-mg immediate-release tablets and as a 
650-mg extended-release preparation. Various children's chewable, suspension, 
and elixir formulations of acetaminophen also are available. Furthermore, 
acetaminophen is found as a component of combination drugs such as 
propoxyphene-acetaminophen (eg, Darvocet) and oxycodone-acetaminophen (eg, 
Percocet).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pathophysiology: </strong>The maximum daily dose of APAP is 4 g in 
adults and 90 mg/kg in children. The toxic dose of APAP after a single acute 
ingestion is 150 mg/kg or approximately 7 g in adults, although the at-risk 
dose may be lower in persons with alcoholism and other susceptible individuals. 
When dosing recommendations are followed, the risk of hepatotoxicity is 
extremely small.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine and 
metabolized by conjugation in the liver to nontoxic agents, which then are 
eliminated in the urine.</p>
<p>In acute overdose or when maximum daily dose is exceeded over a prolonged 
period, the normal pathways of metabolism become saturated. Excess APAP is then 
metabolized in the liver via the mixed function oxidase P450 system to a toxic 
metabolite,<em>N</em>-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI). NAPQI has an 
extremely short half-life and is rapidly conjugated with glutathione, a 
sulfhydryl donor, and removed from the system. Under conditions of excessive 
NAPQI formation or reduced glutathione stores, NAPQI is free to covalently bind 
to vital proteins and the lipid bilayer of hepatocytes; this results in 
hepatocellular death and subsequent centrilobular liver necrosis.</p>
<p>The antidote for APAP poisoning is <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is 
theorized to work by a number of protective mechanisms. Early after overdose, 
NAC prevents the formation and accumulation of NAPQI. NAC increases glutathione 
stores, combines directly with NAPQI as a glutathione substitute, and enhances 
sulfate conjugation. NAC also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve 
microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. Vasodilating 
effects decrease morbidity and mortality once hepatotoxicity is well 
established.</p>
<p>NAC is most effective when administered within 8 hours of ingestion. When 
indicated, however, NAC should be administered regardless of time since the 
overdose. Therapy with NAC has been shown to decrease mortality rates in 
late-presenting patients with fulminant hepatic failure (in the absence of 
acetaminophen in the serum).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Frequency: </strong><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>In the US: </strong>Acetaminophen is one of the most common agents 
in overdose reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. 
APAP toxicity is the most common cause of hepatic failure requiring liver 
transplantation in the United States and Great Britain.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Mortality/Morbidity: </strong>The majority of patients with APAP 
overdose survive with supportive care in conjunction with antidotal therapy. If 
correctly treated in a timely manner, most patients do not suffer significant 
sequelae.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Case series report that fewer than 4% of patients who suffer severe 
hepatotoxicity develop hepatic failure; fatalities or liver transplantation 
occur in less than one half of these patients.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients with malnutrition, AIDS, chronic ethanol abuse, or anorexia 
nervosa may be at incre .....
