<h2>Fevers</h2> 
<h3>What is a fever?</h3> 
<p>A fever is a temperature of 100.4&ordm; F and higher.</p> 
<p>The body has several ways to maintain normal body temperature. The organs 
involved in helping with temperature regulation include the brain, skin, 
muscle, and blood vessels. The body responds to changes in temperature by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>increasing or decreasing sweat production.</li> 
<li>moving blood away from, or closer to, the surface of the skin.</li> 
<li>getting rid of, or holding on to, water in the body.</li> 
<li>naturally wanting to seek a cooler or warmer environment.</li> </ul> 
<p>When your child has a fever, the body works the same way to control the 
temperature, but it resets its thermostat at a higher temperature. The 
temperature increases for a number of reasons:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chemicals, called cytokines and mediators, are produced in the body in 
response to an invasion from a microorganism, malignancy, or other intruder.
</li> 
<li>The body is making more macrophages, which are cells that go to combat 
when intruders are present in the body. These cells actually &quot;eat-up&quot; 
the invading organism.</li> 
<li>The body is busily trying to produce natural antibodies, which fight 
infection. These antibodies will recognize the infection next time it tries to 
invade.</li> 
<li>Many bacteria are enclosed in an overcoat-like membrane. When this 
membrane is disrupted or broken, the contents that escape can be toxic to the 
body and stimulate the brain to raise the temperature.</li> </ul> 
<h3>What conditions can cause a fever?</h3> 
<p>The following conditions can cause a fever:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>infectious diseases</li> 
<li>certain medications</li> 
<li>heat stroke</li> 
<li>blood transfusion</li> 
<li>disorders in the brain</li> </ul> 
<h3>What are the benefits of a fever?</h3> 
<p>A fever actually helps the body destroy its microbial invader. It also 
stimulates an inflammatory response, which sends all kinds of substances to the 
area of infection to protect the area, prevent the spread of the invader, and 
start the healing process.</p> 
<h3>What are the symptoms that my child may have a fever?</h3> 
<p>Children with fevers may become more uncomfortable as the temperature 
rises. The following are the most common symptoms of a fever. However, each 
child may experience symptoms differently. In addition to body temperature 
greater than 100.4&ordm; F, symptoms may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Your child may not be as active or talkative as usual.</li> 
<li>He/she may seem fussier, less hungry, and thirstier.</li> 
<li>Your child may feel warm or hot. Remember that even if your child feels 
like he/she is &ldquo;burning up,&quot; the actual rectal or oral temperature 
may not be that high.</li> </ul> 
<p>The symptoms of a fever may resemble other medical conditions. According to 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, if your child is younger than two months of 
age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, you 
should call your pediatrician. If you are unsure, always consult your child's 
physician for a diagnosis.</p> 
<h3>When should a fever be treated?</h3> 
<p>In children, a fever that is equal to or greater than 102.2&deg; F should 
be treated. Children older than two months of age with a fever of 102&deg; or 
higher that does not respond to fever-reducing medication should be seen by a 
physician. Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years can develop 
seizures from a high fever (called febrile seizures). If your child does have a 
febrile seizure, there is a chance that the seizure may occur again, but, 
usually, children outgrow the febrile seizures. A febrile seizure does not mean 
your child has epilepsy.</p> 
<p>If your child is very uncomfortable with a lower fever, treatment may be 
necessary. Treating your child's fever will not help the body get rid of the 
infection any quicker, it simply will relieve discomfort associated with fever.
</p> 
<h3>What can I do to decrease my child's fever?</h3> 
<p>Specific treatment for a fever will be determined by your physician based 
on:</p> Aspirin and the Risk of Reye Syndrome in Children 
<p>Do not give aspirin to a child without first contacting the child's 
physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for children, has been associated 
with Reye syndrome, a potentially serious or deadly disorder in children. 
Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin 
(or any medication that contains aspirin) not be used to treat any viral 
illnesses in children.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li> 
<li>extent of the condition</li> 
<li>your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
</li> 
<li>expectations for the course of the disease</li> 
<li>your opinion or preference</li> </ul> 
<p>Administer an anti-fever medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. DO 
NOT give your child aspirin, as it has been linked to a serious, potentially 
fatal disease, called Reye syndrome.</p> 
<p>Other ways to reduce a fever:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dress your child lightly. Excess clothing will trap body heat and cause 
the temperature to rise.</li> 
<li>Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, such as juices, soda, 
punch, or popsicles.</li> 
<li>Give your child a lukewarm bath.</li> 
<li>Place cold washcloths over areas of the body where the blood vessels are 
close to the surface of the skin such as the forehead, wrists, and groins.</li> 
<li>Do not use alcohol baths.</li> </ul> 
<h3>When should I call my child's physician?</h3> 
<p>When a child&rsquo;s temperature reaches 105&deg;, this is considered a 
medical emergency and the child needs immediate medical attention, according to 
the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p> 
<p>Call your child's physician immediately if your child is younger than 2 
months old and any of the followings conditions are present:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>rectal temperature is greater than 100.4&ordm;</li> 
<li>your child is crying inconsolably</li> 
<li>your child is difficult to awaken</li> 
<li>your child's neck is stiff</li> 
<li>your child has a convulsion</li> 
<li>any purple spots are present on the skin</li> 
<li>breathing is difficult AND no better after you clear the nose</li> 
<li>your child is unable to swallow anything and is drooling saliva</li> 
<li>your child looks or acts very sick (if possible, check your child's 
appearance one hour after your child has taken an appropriate dose of 
acetaminophen)</li> </ul> 
<p>Call your child's physician within 24 hours if your child is 2 to 4 months 
old and any of the following conditions are present:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the fever is between 104&ordm; F and 105&ordm; F (especially if your child 
is younger than 2 years old)</li> 
<li>burning or pain occurs with urination</li> 
<li>your child has had a fever for more than 24 hours without an obvious cause 
or location of infection</li> </ul> 
<p>Call your child's physician during office hours if any of the following 
conditions are present:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your child has had a fever more than 72 hours</li> 
<li>the fever went away for more than 24 hours and then returned</li> 
<li>your child has a history of febrile seizures</li> 
<li>you have other concerns or questions</li> </ul>
