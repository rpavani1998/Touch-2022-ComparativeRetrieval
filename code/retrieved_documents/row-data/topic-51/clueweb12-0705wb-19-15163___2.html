<p>Today parents have been programmed by advertisers as well as the medical 
community toreduce fever whenever present, even in the light of the side 
effects of fever reducing medicacations. Fever should not be routinely reduced, 
in fact, it has been shown that Fever reducing medications are strongly 
advertised and prescribed, yet for most infections illness and death increase 
when fevers are reduced. Many even believe that recovery from infection is 
swifter when a fever is raised with warm baths, warm fluids, covering warmly, 
or raising the house temperature.</p> 
<p>Fevers are dangerously high however somewhere beyond 103 degrees F, at 
which point reduction through medication or a cool bath should be considered to 
prevent possible brain damage (thought to occur around 106 degrees in children, 
possibly 104 degrees in adults). A child under three months of age with high 
fever must be medically examined. By blocking certain elements of the immune 
system, common fever reducing drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Motrin) 
interfere with disease fighting, and healing as well. Using ibuprofen with 
chicken pox greatly increases the chance of developing necrotizing fasciitis 
(flesh eating bacteria) infection, since it reduces a child's immune defenses. 
Asprin use with influenza or chicken pox can lead to dangerous Reye's syndrome. 
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) prolongs chicken pox illness, among others, and poses 
liver risks.</p>
