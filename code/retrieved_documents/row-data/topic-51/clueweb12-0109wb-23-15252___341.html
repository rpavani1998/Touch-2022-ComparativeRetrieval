<p>  Major manufacturer of unapproved and adulterated drugs agrees to stop

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Amerinet leadership changes hands as Ebert takes the helm</p> 
<p> Todd Ebert, president and chief operating officer of Amerinet Inc., saw 
his leadership role within the national group purchasing organization expanded 
even more following the announced resignation today of CEO Victor Samolovitch. 
Though Ebert takes the chief executive reins of Amerinet, responsible for 
overall leadership of the organization, his professional elevation does not 
include the CEO title, which has been shelved. As president, Ebert &ldquo;will 
focus on continued implementation of the Amerinet strategic business plan 
adopted in June 2006,&rdquo; he told Healthcare Purchasing News in a prepared 
statement. &ldquo;The plan calls for continued organizational growth, 
investment into&nbsp;program development&nbsp;and differentiating Amerinet in 
the marketplace.&nbsp;Key areas include programs and services such as clinical 
consulting, clinical preference&nbsp;products and data analysis and management 
tools.&rdquo; For now the CEO position will not exist, according to Lisa 
DiMuccio-Conway, Amerinet&rsquo;s vice president of marketing, and &ldquo;there 
is not to be a CEO search at this time.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Samolovitch was promoted to Amerinet CEO last June as the GPO celebrated 
its 20th anniversary and was embarking on a new business model that unified its 
three shareholder organizations under a single national platform. He succeeded 
the retiring Robert P. &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Bowen. Samolovitch was president of 
Warrendale, PA-based Amerinet Central, one of the GPO&rsquo;s key shareholder 
companies. Samolovitch also had been part of Amerinet since 1986. When Bowen 
retired, Amerinet tapped Samolovitch to be CEO and created a new position for 
Ebert, who had served as president. As president and newly named chief 
operating officer, Ebert would oversee &ldquo;customer-facing 
operations,&rdquo; such as contracting, marketing and sales. He originally 
hailed from Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Health Care, another key 
Amerinet shareholder.</p> 
<p> Bert Zimmerli, Amerinet&rsquo;s chairman of the board, praised Samolovitch 
for his leadership role in the GPO&rsquo;s move to a single organization from 
the shareholder-based structure it operated under since its inception in 1986. 
&ldquo;Over the past year, Vic has been instrumental in leading Amerinet 
through its organizational transition to one national group purchasing 
organization,&rdquo; Zimmerli stated in a press release distributed to the 
media this morning. &ldquo;Thanks to Vic&rsquo;s vision and perseverance, 
Amerinet developed a restructuring plan that solidly positions the organization 
for future success and growth.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>AmeriNet, (its original designation in 1986), comprised four multi-state 
regional purchasing groups during its debut: Haricomp (which became Vector 
Healthsystem), Health Services Corporation of America (which left the GPO four 
years later and now is part of MedAssets), Hospital Shared Services of Western 
Pennsylvania (which became Amerinet Central) and Intermountain Health Care. 
Based in St. Louis, with offices in Salt Lake City, Providence, RI, and 
Warrendale, PA, Amerinet serves more than 22,000 acute and non-acute healthcare 
providers nationwide. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> SterilMed and The Scope Exchange merge</b></p> 
<p>  SterilMed and The Scope Exchange have reached an agreement to merge. The 
merger is part of SterilMed and The Scope Exchange&rsquo;s strategy to help 
healthcare providers conserve their resources by extending the life of medical 
devices, instruments, and equipment. Combining the two companies&rsquo; 
expertise in the repair and reprocessing of medical devices will provide 
customers with a comprehensive single-source supplier.The merged expertise 
combined with SterilMed&rsquo;s broad market presence will further strengthen 
the breadth of services provided, including industry leading technical 
capabilities and showcase repair facilities. The newly formed company can now 
offer the benefits of an integrated reprocessing and repair service approach.

<p><b> CMS proposes payment changes for Medicare home health services </b> 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed a rule 
designed to ensure more appropriate payment for services provided by Medicare 
home health agencies, while establishing incentives for more efficient care for 
Medicare beneficiaries.&nbsp;This proposed rule contains the first refinements 
to the Medicare home health prospective payment system (HH PPS) since 2000 and 
also contains the annual update to the Medicare HH PPS payment rates. The net 
impact of all of the proposed refinements and updates in the HH PPS proposed 
rule is an estimated additional $140 million in payments to home health 
agencies in CY 2008.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The proposed home health market basket increase for CY 2008 is 2.9%. Home 
health agencies (HHAs)&nbsp;collect and report Outcome and Assessment 
Information Set (OASIS) data.&nbsp;For CY 2008, CMS proposes to evaluate home 
health care quality by continuing to rely on the submission of OASIS 
assessments.&nbsp;Continuing to use the current OASIS instrument ensures that 
providers would avoid any additional burden of reporting through a separate 
mechanism and any related costs associated with the development and testing of 
a new reporting mechanism.&nbsp;The proposed rule includes a provision to 
continue to adjust payment for reporting of quality data.&nbsp;HHAs that submit 
the required quality data would receive payments based on the proposed full 
home health market basket update of 2.9 percent for CY 2008. If a HHA does not 
submit quality data, the home health market basket percentage increase would be 
reduced by 2 percentage points to 0.9 percent for CY 2008.&nbsp;The proposed 
rule adds two National Quality Forum-endorsed measures to the 10 that are 
currently reported: emergent care for wound infections - deteriorating wound 
status; and improvement in status of surgical wound.</p> 
<p>  CMS&nbsp;analysis of the latest available home health claims data 
indicates a significant increase in the observed case-mix since 2000 and that 
the case-mix increase is due to changes in coding practices and documentation 
rather than to treatment of more resource-intensive patients.&nbsp;To account 
for the changes in case-mix that are not related to a home health 
patient&rsquo;s actual clinical condition, this rule proposes to reduce the 
national standardized 60-day episode payment rate by 2.75 percent per year for 
three years beginning in CY 2008.&nbsp;This rule proposes ways to improve the 
comprehensiveness of the case-mix model and thus improve the accuracy of 
Medicare&rsquo;s payments. The proposed case-mix model includes a proposal to 
replace the current therapy threshold at 10 visits per episode with three new 
therapy thresholds at six, 14, and 20 therapy visits.&nbsp;The new levels would 
have graduated payment levels between the proposed therapy thresholds to reduce 
incentives to inappropriately target higher thresholds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This rule also proposes to modify the low utilization payment adjustment 
(LUPA) and to eliminate the significant change in condition payment 
adjustment.&nbsp;The rule proposes to increase payment for LUPA episodes that 
occur as the only episode or the first episode during a series of home health 
episodes to account for the initial greater costs in such episodes. CMS&nbsp;is 
also proposing to revise the way to account for non-routine medical supplies 
(NRS) in the standardized 60-day episode payment rate. This rule proposes to 
pay for NRS based on 5 severity groups, similar to the proposed clinical 
case-mix model, to more accurately reflect home health agency costs for 
NRS.&nbsp;The comment period closes on Tuesday, June 26.The proposed rule is 
available at THIS LINK. <br>

<p><b> CMS issues guidance on hospital emergency services requirements </b></p>
<p> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance 
clarifying the responsibility of hospitals provide emergency services if they 
participate in the Medicare program.&nbsp;The guidance makes it clear that 
nearly all hospitals, including specialty hospitals and others without 
emergency departments, must be able to evaluate persons with emergencies, 
provide initial treatment, and refer or transfer these individuals when 
appropriate.&nbsp;The guidance does not apply to critical access hospitals 
(CAHs), which are small, rural hospitals that are subject to separate 
regulation.</p> 
<p> Today&rsquo;s letter reiterates Medicare&rsquo;s long-standing requirement 
that hospitals have appropriate policies and procedures in place to address 
individuals&rsquo; emergency care needs 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 
&ldquo;Any hospital participating in Medicare, regardless of the type of 
hospital and apart from whether the hospital has an emergency department must 
have the capability to provide basic emergency care interventions.&rdquo; said 
Leslie V. Norwalk, Esq., Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; 
Medicaid Services.&nbsp;&ldquo;The guidance we are issuing today is part of an 
overall strategy to ensure quality care by assuring the rapid response to 
emergencies for all people with Medicare.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Three key requirements are (a) the capability to appraise the emergency 
situation, (b) providing initial treatment, and (c) referral when appropriate. 
The letter clarifies that the Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs) do 
not permit a hospital to rely upon 9-1-1 services as a substitute for the 
hospital&rsquo;s own ability to provide these services.&nbsp;In a separate 
development, CMS issued a proposed rule on April 13, 2007 that would increase 
transparency and public disclosure concerning emergency services.&nbsp;The FY 
2008 acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) proposed 
rule would require a hospital to notify all patients in writing if a doctor of 
medicine or doctor of osteopathy is not present in the hospital 24 hours a day, 
seven days per week.&nbsp;The hospital would be required to disclose how it 
would meet the medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency condition 
while no doctor is on site.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> CMS also invited comments on whether current requirements for emergency 
service capabilities in hospitals with and without emergency departments should 
be strengthened in certain areas, such as the types of clinical personnel that 
should be present at all times and their competencies; the type of emergency 
response equipment that should be available; and whether hospital emergency 
departments should be required to operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. 
Although the survey guidance issued today applies to all hospitals, it also 
implements one element of the<i>Strategic and Implementing Plan for Specialty 
Hospitals</i> that CMS reported to Congress in August of 2006, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 5006 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. For

</i><b> Joint update: FDA/USDA update on tainted animal feed 
</b></p> 
<p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) continue their investigation of imported rice protein 
concentrate which has been found to contain melamine and melamine-related 
compounds. Based on information currently available, FDA and USDA believe the 
likelihood of illness after eating pork from swine fed the contaminated product 
would be very low. The agencies are taking certain actions out of an abundance 
of caution. As announced on April 26, swine known to have been fed adulterated 
(contaminated) product will not be approved to enter the food supply. (Because 
the animal feed in question was adulterated, USDA cannot rule out the 
possibility that food produced from animals fed this product could also be 
adulterated.)<br>
<br>
 As reported on April 22 by FDA, the Agency determined 
that rice protein concentrate imported from China was contaminated with 
melamine and melamine-related compounds. The product was imported by 
Wilbur-Ellis, an importer and distributor of agricultural products. Although 
the company began importing product from China in August 2006, the company did 
not become aware of the contamination until April 2007. As part of the ongoing 
investigation, FDA has determined the rice protein was used in the production 
of pet food and a portion of the pet food was used to produce animal feed. The 
ongoing investigation is tracing products distributed since August 2006 by 
Wilbur-Ellis throughout the distribution chain.</p> 
<p> <br>
 At this time, the agencies have no evidence of harm to humans 
associated with the processed pork product, and therefore no recall of meat 
products processed from these animals is being issued. If any evidence surfaces 
to indicate there is harm to humans, the appropriate action will be taken. The 
assessment that, if there were to be harm to human health, it would be very 
low, is based on a number of factors, including the dilution of the 
contaminating melamine and melamine-related compounds from the original rice 
protein concentrate as it moves through the food system. First it is a partial 
ingredient in the pet food; second, it is only part of the total feed given to 
the hogs; third, it is not known to accumulate in the hogs and the hogs excrete 
melamine in their urine; fourth, even if present in pork, pork is only a small 
part of the average American diet. Neither FDA nor USDA has uncovered any 
evidence of harm to the swine from the contaminated feed.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In addition, the agencies are not aware of any human illness that has 
occurred from exposure to melamine or its by-products. To further evaluate any 
potential harm to humans, the FDA is developing and implementing further tests 
and risk assessments based on the toxicity of the compounds and how much of the 
compounds consumers could be expected to actually consume.The ongoing 
investigation and product reconciliation and testing have led to certain farms. 
The agencies expect the investigation will continue to find more places where 
product may have been distributed. As of April 26, sites in the following 
states are believed to have received and used contaminated product: California, 
Kansas, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah.</p>

<b>Alzheimer&rsquo;s memory loss may one day be reversible</b>
</p> 
<p>  A new US study suggests it may one day be possible to reverse the memory 
loss associated with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and similar degenerative brain diseases. 
The study is published in<i> Nature</i>. Scientists at MIT&rsquo;s Picower 
Institute for Learning and Memory in Cambridge, MA, put mice with induced brain 
atrophy in an enriched environment; a &ldquo;playground&rdquo; where they had 
the company of other mice, were given new colorful toys to play with every day, 
and were able to exercise on wheels. The enriched environment mice recovered 
long term memories while mice kept in a bare cage on their own did not. Li-Huei 
Tsai, Picower Professor of Neuroscience in the Department of Brain and 
Cognitive Sciences and her colleagues got the same results when they gave the 
brain atrophied mice a new type of experimental drug called histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibitors. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system are frequently 
accompanied by impaired learning and memory, and eventually dementia. 
Scientists have been trying to find ways to reverse the process and 
re-establish the ability to learn and remember. In this study, Prof Tsai showed 
it was possible to &ldquo;re-established access to long-term memories after 
significant brain atrophy and neuronal loss had already occurred&rdquo;. The 
stimulated mice&rsquo;s brain cells had sprouted new dendrites and produced new 
synapses, in effect reversing the degeneration. Prof Tsai, who is also a Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute investigator, said: &ldquo;This is exciting because 
our results show that learning ability can be improved and &lsquo;lost&rsquo; 
long-term memories can be recovered even after a significant number of neurons 
have already been lost in the brain.&rdquo; &ldquo;This hints at the 
possibility that cognitive function can be improved even in advanced stages of 
dementia,&rdquo; she added.</p> 
<p>  HDACs help genes that have been too tightly packed in the nucleus of 
cells to express themselves and make proteins. HDACs have been increasingly 
used by researchers in other fields, for instance in clinical trials with 
Huntington&rsquo;s disease patients. Some HDACs are already available to help 
chemotherapy drugs target DNA by opening up the chromatin structure. However, 
as Prof Tsai said: &ldquo;To our knowledge, HDACs have not been used to treat 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia. Future research should address whether 
HDAC inhibitors will be effective for treating neurodegenerative 
diseases.&rdquo; Speculating on their findings, Prof Tsai and her colleagues 
suggested that perhaps degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s do 
not wipe out memories, but make them inaccessible in some way. Many treatments 
for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other brain degenerative diseases target the early 
stages, while this study suggests memory and learning may be restorable even 
when the brain is already quite damaged. A new report from the 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association says there are now more than 5 million Americans 
living with the disease. At present one American develops Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
every 72 seconds. This is estimated to become every 33 seconds by 2050 as 78 
million baby boomers began turning 60 last year. (Medical News Today) For the

<h2> Major manufacturer of unapproved and adulterated drugs agrees to stop 
illegal practices<br>
<br>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
announced the entry of a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction against 
PharmaFab Inc., its subsidiary, PFab LP, and two company officials, Mark 
Tengler, PharmaFab&rsquo;s president, and Russ McMahen, PFab&rsquo;s vice 
president of scientific affairs, to stop the illegal manufacture and 
distribution of prescription and over-the-counter drug products. The products 
are illegal because they are not produced according to the required current 
good manufacturing practice (CGMP) and many also lack required FDA approval. 
The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas. PharmaFab is a major contract manufacturer and distributor 
of more than 100 different prescription and over-the-counter drug products, 
including cough and cold products, ulcer treatments, and postpartum hemorrhage 
products. Consumers who have products manufactured by PharmaFab should consult 
with their physician.</h2> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The unapproved drugs manufactured by PharmaFab include, but are not 
limited to: De-Congestine Sustained Release Capsules; GFN 1200/DM 60/PSE 60 
Extended-Release Tablets; Rhinacon A Tablets; Sudal 12 Chewable Tablets; Histex 
PD 12 Suspension; Atuss HX CIII; Ergotrate Tablets; and Hyoscyamine Sulfate 
Time-Release Capsules. Because these drugs have not undergone FDA approval, 
their safety and effectiveness have not been established, and FDA has not 
reviewed the adequacy and accuracy of the directions and warnings in their 
labeling. According to the complaint filed with the court, PharmaFab did not 
comply with CGMP by not investigating manufacturing failures and not recording 
and justifying why it deviated from written manufacturing procedures. Further, 
the company lacked an effective quality control unit and failed to establish 
reliable expiration dates for products. Compliance with CGMP is necessary to 
ensure that drugs have the requisite safety, identity, strength, quality, and 
purity.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The consent decree requires the defendants to destroy certain 
illegal drugs, and bars them from distributing all drugs until they obtain 
required FDA approval and fully comply with CGMP. If they resume distributing 
drugs, the defendants are required to retain an auditor to conduct inspections 
of their facilities for a period of five years and to provide reports to FDA 
analyzing compliance with CGMP and labeling requirements. The decree also 
allows FDA to require recall or shutdown in the event of future violations and 
provides for damages of $5,000 per day and $1,000 per violation, up to a 
maximum of $5 million per year, if the defendants fail to comply with its terms.

<p>  AmerisourceBergen Corporation announced that the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) has temporarily suspended the Orlando, FL Distribution 
Center&rsquo;s (DC), license to distribute DEA controlled substances and listed 
chemicals. The temporary suspension affects only the Orlando DC and only DEA 
controlled items. The action may impact approximately 1,400 pharmacy customers 
in Florida. In the event this temporary suspension is not quickly resolved, 
alternative arrangements will be made for customers served by the Orlando 
Distribution Center, so they will not be inconvenienced. The DEA asserts that 
AmerisourceBergen did not maintain effective controls against diversion of 
controlled substances, specifically hydrocodone, to four internet pharmacies 
from January 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007. Historically, AmerisourceBergen 
has proactively cooperated with the DEA in preventing diversion of hydrocodone 
and other controlled substances, and will fully cooperate with the agency in 
resolving the temporary suspension. The Company has a diversion program and a 
DEA-approved suspicious-order monitoring program in place to identify customers 
who are suspected of inappropriately selling products sold to them by 
AmerisourceBergen. All of the Orlando Distribution Center&rsquo;s DEA audits, 
the most recent within the last year, were passed with no deficiencies found. 
AmerisourceBergen is not doing business with any of the four customers cited by 
the DEA, and all of the pharmacies mentioned by the agency held active DEA 
licenses to sell controlled substances at the time AmerisourceBergen sold 
product to them. </p>

the journal<i>Science</i>, boost to at least 10 the number of genetic variants 
confidently associated with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, a 
disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. &ldquo;This 
achievement represents a major milestone in our battle against diabetes. It 
will accelerate efforts to understand the genetic risk factors for this 
disease, as well as explore how these genetic factors interact with each other 
and with lifestyle factors,&rdquo; said National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. &ldquo;Such research is opening the door to 
the era of personalized medicine. Our current one-size-fits-all approach will 
soon give way to more individualized strategies based on each person's unique 
genetic make-up.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 To make their discoveries, researchers used a relatively new, 
comprehensive strategy known as a genome-wide association study. 
&ldquo;Genome-wide association studies offer a powerful way to uncover the 
genetic variations that contribute to diabetes, as well as other common 
conditions, such as asthma, arthritis, heart disease, cancer and mental 
illnesses,&rdquo; said lead study author, Michael Boehnke, Ph.D., of the 
University of Michigan's School of Public Health, Ann Arbor. &ldquo;Once 
susceptibility genes are identified, researchers then can use this information 
to develop better approaches to detecting, treating and preventing 
disease.&rdquo; To conduct a genome-wide association study, researchers use two 
groups of participants: a large group of people with the disease being studied 
and a large group of otherwise similar people without the disease. Utilizing 
DNA purified from blood or cells, researchers quickly survey each 
participant&rsquo;s complete set of DNA, or genome, for strategically selected 
markers of genetic variation. If certain genetic variations are found more 
frequently in people with the disease compared to healthy people, the 
variations are said to be associated with the disease. The associated genetic 
variations can serve as a strong pointer to the region of the genome where the 
genetic risk factor resides. However, the first variants detected may not 
themselves directly influence disease susceptibility, and the actual causative 
variant may lie nearby. This means researchers often need to take additional 
steps, such as sequencing every DNA base pair in that particular region of the 
genome, to identify the exact genetic variant that affects disease risk.</p> 
<p> <br>
 In the latest work, researchers began by scanning the genomes of 
more than 2,300 Finnish people who took part in the Finland-United States 
Investigation Of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) and Finrisk 2002 studies. About half 
of the participants had type 2 diabetes and the other half had normal blood 
glucose levels. To validate their findings, the researchers compared their 
initial results with results from genome scans of 3,000 Swedish and Finnish 
participants in the Diabetes Genetics Initiative and 5,000 British participants 
in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, led by Peter Donnelly, D.Phil., 
Oxford University. After identifying promising leads through this approach, the 
three research teams jointly replicated their findings using smaller, more 
focused sets of genetic markers in additional groups totaling more than 22,000 
people from Finland, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
All told, the genomes of 32,554 people were tested for the study, making it one 
of the largest genome-wide association efforts conducted to date. Ultimately, 
the researchers identified four new diabetes-associated variations, as well as 
confirmed previous findings that associated six other genetic variants with 
increased diabetes risk.</p> 
<p> <br>
 When the genomes of the Finnish participants were scanned for all 10 
diabetes-associated genetic variants, researchers could identify individuals 
whose genetic profiles placed them at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, 
including one subset of people who faced a risk four times higher than those at 
the lowest genetic risk. This &ldquo;could potentially have value in a 
personalized preventive medicine program,&rdquo; the researchers wrote. 
However, the researchers emphasized that their predictions of disease risk need 
to be interpreted with caution because the diabetes group in their sample was 
&ldquo;enriched&rdquo; with people who had affected siblings and because the 
healthy group excluded people who had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired 
fasting glucose. For more information about genome-wide association studies, see

<b>Over time, more women are developing MS than men</b></p> 
<p> <br>
 Over time, more women are developing multiple sclerosis (MS) than 
men, according to research that will be presented at the American Academy of 
Neurology&rsquo;s 59th Annual Meeting in Boston, April 28 &ndash; May 5, 2007. 
In 1940, the ratio of women to men with MS in the United States was 
approximately two to one. By 2000, that ratio had grown to approximately four 
to one. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an increase in the ratio of women to men of nearly 
50 percent per decade,&rdquo; said study author Gary Cutter, PhD, of the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health. &ldquo;We 
don&rsquo;t yet know why more women are developing MS than men, and more 
research is needed.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Cutter said researchers will need to explore multiple changes that have 
occurred for women over the last several decades, including the use of oral 
contraceptives, earlier menstruation, obesity rates, changes in smoking rates, 
and later age of first births. &ldquo;We also need to ask the general questions 
about what women do differently than men, such as use of hair dye and use of 
cosmetics that may block vitamin D absorption,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At this 
point we&rsquo;re just speculating on avenues of research that could be 
pursued.&rdquo; Cutter said the largest increase in the ratio has been for 
those whose MS started at younger ages. For the study, researchers examined a 
database (the North American Research Committee On Multiple Sclerosis, or 
NARCOMS, hosted at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Ariz.) of 30,336 
people with MS and determined the male/female ratio according to the year the 
disease was diagnosed and the age of the person when the disease started. </p>

New prostate cancer test may detect more tumors</b></p> 
<p> An experimental blood test for prostate cancer may help eliminate tens of 
thousands of unnecessary biopsies at the same time that it detects many tumors 
that are now missed by the test commonly used, its developers said. PSA, the 
current test, measures a protein normally produced by the prostate, while the 
experimental one, called EPCA-2, detects a chemical made principally in 
cancerous tissue. Prostate cancer, the most common malignancy in men, is one of 
the more perplexing areas of medicine. Physicians are unsure how to find it and 
when to treat it. Today, about 80 percent of prostate biopsies find no tumor, a 
percentage that is rising as physicians become more aggressive in searching for 
the disease. &ldquo;We hope this will minimize the number of unnecessary 
biopsies,&rdquo; said Robert H. Getzenberg, a molecular biologist at Johns 
Hopkins Hospital who developed the new test, which is still under study and not 
yet commercially available. A description of it appears in the journal<i>Urology
</i>.<br>
<br>
 &rdquo;It&rsquo;s an exciting new marker,&rdquo; said Martin G. 
Sanda, a urologist at Harvard Medical School. &ldquo;There certainly is a need 
for a better test than PSA. Everyone accepts that.&rdquo; His view was echoed 
by Gerald L. Andriole Jr., chief of urologic surgery at Washington University 
School of Medicine, who said that &ldquo;if the data hold up, this marker will 
be a substantial improvement over PSA.&rdquo; The PSA test casts a net that is 
too big and too full of holes. Finding a replacement that catches fewer healthy 
men, but more of those who do have cancer, would help settle at least one of 
the clinical conundrums concerning prostate cancer. The new test is being 
developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Onconome Inc., a 
Seattle-based biomedical company. It could become commercially available in 
2008. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> EPCA-2 is a protein that is part of the &ldquo;nuclear matrix,&rdquo; the 
scaffolding inside a cell&rsquo;s nucleus that helps it copy its genes. The 
Hopkins researchers measured it in different groups of men whose cancer status 
was known. They tried the new test on 30 men with PSA readings above 2.5 and in 
whom biopsies found no cancer. All had normal EPCA-2 readings (below 30 ng per 
ml.). This suggested that the test may eliminate many of the 
&ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; PSA results, readings that are abnormal but 
apparently do not denote cancer. On the other hand, the EPCA-2 test appears 
able to detect cancer even when the tumor is small. It identified 36 out of 40 
men who had cancer confined to the prostate gland, and 39 out of 40 men in whom 
the tumor had spread. It also identified many men, 14 out of 18, who had cancer 
but whose PSAs were normal. This last group is especially worrisome to 
physicians. A study published three years ago found that about 12 percent of 
men with normal PSA readings have cancer. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The new test is not perfect, though. Getzenberg and his colleagues tried 
it on 35 men with severe &ldquo;benign prostatic hypertrophy&rdquo;, 
enlargement of the prostate that sometimes makes the PSA go up but is not 
cancer. In eight of them, the EPCA-2 was high, suggesting that the EPCA-2 test 
would flag some men who turn out not to have cancer, although probably not as 
many as the PSA test does. The new test will not help solve the other major 
clinical uncertainty in prostate cancer. It is unclear who will clearly benefit 
from aggressive treatment and who are likely to be able to live a normal life 
if the tumors are simply followed and removed only if they begin to cause 
symptoms. (Washington Post)</p>

<h1><br>
NEJM: Physician ties to drug industry stronger than ever</h1> 
<p>Despite the potential for conflict of interest, virtually all practicing 
physicians in the U.S. have some form of relationship with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers but the nature and extent of those relationships vary, depending 
on the kind of practice, medical specialty, patient mix, and professional 
activities, reports a study in the April 26 issue of<i>the New England Journal 
of Medicine</i>. In the first national survey to gauge the predictors and depth 
of relationships between industry and practicing physicians, 94 percent of 
doctors report that they have at least one type of relationship with the drug 
industry, mostly in the form of receiving food in the workplace or prescription 
samples. However, more than one third are reimbursed for costs associated with 
professional meetings or continuing medical education (CME), and more than a 
quarter receive honoraria for consulting, lecturing or enrolling patients in 
clinical trials, say researchers.</p> 
<p>The findings, from a survey of 1,662 practicing physicians conducted in 
late 2003 and 2004, also show that drug and device manufacturers pick and 
choose which doctors to form the strongest ties with. For example, 
cardiologists are more than twice as likely as family practitioners to receive 
direct payments from drug companies for consulting and other services and are 
also significantly more likely to be paid honoraria than pediatricians, 
anesthesiologists, or surgeons. &ldquo;Cardiology is a highly influential 
specialty within the medical profession. If the drug and device industry can 
influence cardiologists, they can likely influence the prescribing practices of 
other doctors,&rdquo; said lead researcher and co-author Eric Campbell, Ph.D., 
an associate professor of medicine at the Institute for Health Policy at 
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Campbell and his co-authors, including Institute for Health Policy Director 
David Blumenthal, MD, report that the idea that companies target opinion 
leaders for marketing is further suggested by the higher frequency of industry 
payments to physicians who have developed clinical guidelines and who serve as 
mentors for doctors in training. Researchers surveyed physicians in six 
specialties (anesthesiology, cardiology, family practice, general surgery, 
internal medicine, and pediatrics) to measure the extent of their financial 
associations with industry and the factors that predict those ties. The study 
found striking differences in the nature of physician-industry relationships 
depending on the primary practice location of the physician. Compared to 
physicians practicing in hospitals, those in group practices were three times 
as likely to receive gifts and nearly four times more likely to be paid for 
professional services. Group practice physicians along with solo or two-person 
practices also met more frequently with industry representatives such as drug 
detailers than did physicians practicing in hospitals or clinics or staff model 
HMOs. The authors suggest that the primary reason for these differences is that 
hospitals may be more likely to have policies and practices in place that limit 
physician contact with industry representatives. It may also be that hospitals 
are more likely to provide physician education through grand rounds and CME 
events, rendering physicians in these facilities less dependent on industry 
representatives as the source of medical education and information.</p> 
<p>The survey also found that: Pediatricians and anesthesiologists were 
significantly less likely than family practitioners to receive samples, 
reimbursements and payments for professional services. Family practitioners 
reported the highest average number of meetings with industry representatives 
(16 meetings a month), followed by internists and cardiologists (9-10 per 
month, respectively). Anesthesiologists had only 2 meetings a month. All 
specialties except anesthesiology appear to be meeting more frequently with 
industry today as compared to 2000, when the average was about 4.4 meetings per 
month. Women physicians are less likely to receive payment than their male 
counterparts. Physicians were more likely to receive payments if less than 25 
percent of their patients were uninsured or covered by Medicaid. </p>

<b>IOM report: The future of disability in America</b></p> 
<p> Today more than 40 million Americans live with a disability. If we 
consider people who now have disabilities, people who are likely to develop 
disabilities, and people who are or will be affected by the disabilities of 
family members and others close to them, then disability will affect the lives 
of most Americans. Members of the baby boom generation, people born between 
1946 and 1964, face an especially uncertain future as they grow older, as their 
risk of disability increases, and as programs such as Social Security and 
Medicare face serious funding challenges. Disability in the form of limited 
activities and restricted participation in social life is not an unavoidable 
result of injury and chronic disease. It results, in part, from choices society 
makes about working conditions, health care, transportation, housing, and other 
aspects of our environment. The United States faces important decisions that 
could reduce, or increase, the extent to which people can live independently 
and be involved in their communities. Inaction may lead to diminished quality 
of life, increased stress on individuals and families, and lost productivity.
</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was asked to assess the current situation 
and provide recommendations for improvement, which culminated in the report 
&ldquo;The Future of Disability in America&rdquo;. The committee reviewed 
developments since two previous IOM reports on disability (1991, 
&ldquo;Disability in America&rdquo; and 1997, &ldquo;Enabling America&rdquo;), 
analyzed a number of shortcomings in the nation&rsquo;s disability policies and 
programs, and raised serious questions about how individuals and society will 
cope with the challenges of disability. Some progress has been made since the 
release of the two previous reports: The growth of assistive and 
&ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; electronic technologies allows many people to interact 
more easily with their environments; and advances in public health and medicine 
have contributed to reduced incidences of certain injuries, developmental 
disorders, and other potentially disabling health conditions. However, too 
little progress has been made in adopting the major public policy and practice 
recommendations made in the 1991 and 1997 IOM reports. Due in part to 
inadequate implementation and enforcement, the 1991 Americans with Disability 
Act (ADA) has not lived up to its promise. Physical and other barriers still 
exist in many places, even hospitals and medical offices. Research spending on 
disability is inadequate. Medicare, Medicaid, and private health plans employ 
outdated policies for covering assistive technologies and services.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The new report encourages agencies involved in disability monitoring to 
adopt the World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as their conceptual framework. Using 
the ICF would help standardize how agencies describe and measure different 
aspects of disability, which would improve the clarity and comparability of 
research findings and strengthen the base of scientific knowledge that guides 
public policies and health practices. This report reiterates the absence of a 
comprehensive disability monitoring system and recommends creating one. The 
current report recommends increasing public funding to support a program for 
research. Federal funding agencies should invest more in the development, 
testing, and dissemination of promising interventions that will help people 
maintain their independence and ability to function in community life. The 
report recommends that policymakers eliminate or modify the 
&ldquo;in-home-use&rdquo; requirement in the Medicare statute and regulations. 
This provision keeps many from obtaining scooters and wheelchairs that would 
allow them to navigate reliably and safely outside the home. For more

Prognosis: Predicting heart disease among the 20-somethings </b>
</p> 
<p> It&rsquo;s never too soon to think about the risk of cardiac disease. A 
study published today has found that mildly elevated levels of cholesterol or 
slightly above normal blood pressure from ages 18 to 30 are strong predictors 
of having coronary artery calcium at ages 30 to 35. Coronary artery calcium, a 
form of arterial plaque, is a predictor of later heart disease. Researchers 
recruited 5,115 people from 18 to 30 in 1985 and 1986 and followed them with 
physical examinations 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 years later. The scientists tested 
blood pressure, cholesterol and serum glucose levels and recorded body mass 
index. The study appears in<i>The Journal of the American College of Cardiology
</i>. At the year-15 examination, 10 percent had coronary artery calcium 
detectable on a CT scan. Compared with young adults who had below-optimal 
levels of the risk factors at the start of the study, those with above-optimal 
levels were one and a half to three times as likely to have coronary artery 
calcium 15 years later. Catherine Loria, the lead author and an epidemiologist 
at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said even young people should 
be screened. &ldquo;If they do have above-optimal levels, even slightly,&rdquo; 
she added, &ldquo;they might want to make lifestyle changes to reduce their 
risk.&rdquo; At the start of the study, 20 percent had high levels of LDL, the 
so-called bad cholesterol, and a third were overweight. Twenty-five percent 
smoked cigarettes. By the 15th year, fewer smoked, but 30 percent had 
above-normal LDL, 35 percent had elevated blood pressure, and more than 
two-thirds were overweight or obese. (The New York Times) </p>

<p> <b>Cheaper, easier virtual colonoscopy could boost detection</b><br>
<br>
 
A cutting-edge technology called &ldquo;virtual colonoscopy&rdquo; promises 
fewer complications and better cost-effectiveness than traditional colonoscopy, 
researchers report. These technologies have been compared before, but the 
current analysis relies on the notion that identifying and removing polyps 
smaller than 6 millimeters won&rsquo;t do much to reduce colorectal cancer 
cases. &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s virtually no risk associated with having 
such small polyps, 90 percent of folks don&rsquo;t need an invasive and 
expensive colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer,&rdquo; explained lead 
researcher Dr. Perry J. Pickhardt, an associate professor in the school of 
medicine and public health and radiologist at the University of Wisconsin in 
Madison. &ldquo;So, here it was easy to show that virtual colonoscopy is a very 
effective way to filter out these people and hone in on those who really need 
the more invasive procedure,&rdquo; he said. Pickhardt is not suggesting that 
virtual colonoscopies replace traditional optical screening. But non-invasive 
screening might up the number of people who decide to undergo screening, he 
said. &ldquo;We need to encourage more folks to get screened, period,&rdquo; he 
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to take away from the screening already in 
place. It&rsquo;s a personal choice. Some people prefer the colonoscopy route 
compared to virtual colonoscopy, and that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Pickhardt and his colleagues discussed their findings in the June 1 issue 
of the journal<i>Cancer</i>. Virtual colonoscopy involves a combination of 
sophisticated X-rays and CT scans of the abdomen after it has been pumped with 
air. A two- and three-dimensional computer model of the gastrointestinal tract 
is then generated, potentially revealing cancerous and precancerous lesions. If 
dangerous lesions are spotted, a second, more invasive procedure is required. 
Unlike traditional colonoscopy, the virtual method is faster, involves no 
sedation, no post-procedure recovery, and no risk of invasive complications 
such as abdominal bleeding or life-threatening bowel perforation. However, the 
American Cancer Society (ACS) has not yet backed this option as a proven 
screening method, citing the need for further research. Instead, the group 
suggests other screening methods, including blood stool tests; a barium enema 
combined with X-rays; a flexible sigmoidoscopy and traditional optical 
colonoscopy. All people over 50 are encouraged to undergo a regular colonoscopy 
once every 10 years, or either a barium enema or a flexible sigmoidoscopy (with 
or without a yearly blood test) once every five years. The ACS does<i>not</i> 
deem a digital rectal exam to be a sufficient means of screening.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> To compare some of these options, Pickhardt and his colleagues developed a 
mathematical model involving 100,000 patients with an average risk for 
colorectal cancer. In the computer simulation, all of these 
&ldquo;patients&rdquo; (over the age of 50) were screened for colon cancer once 
every decade for three decades, using either a standard colonoscopy, a flexible 
sigmoidoscopy, a virtual colonoscopy, or a combination thereof. Polyp searches 
were based on one of two thresholds: those measuring 6 millimeters in diameter 
and up, and lesions of any size. The model indicated that 2,940 patients would 
ultimately go on to develop colorectal cancer. The simulation also revealed 
that flexible sigmoidoscopy screenings reduced the rate of cancer by just over 
31 percent, while traditional colonoscopy reduced the rate by just over 40 
percent. Virtual colonoscopies were only slightly less efficient than the 
traditional method, achieving an almost 38 percent reduction when polyps of all 
sizes were considered. The prevention rate dropped slightly, to 36.5 percent, 
when screenings focused only on polyps 6 millimeters and up. Virtual 
colonoscopy also had the added benefit of dramatically reducing the need for 
unnecessary polyp removal. Nearly 78 percent fewer patients went on to have an 
invasive polyp removal after a virtual screening compared with patients who 
underwent a regular colonoscopy. And when virtual screenings focused solely on 
lesions 6 millimeters and up nearly 12,900 additional unwarranted polyp 
removals were avoided. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In terms of both preventing cancer and minimizing cost, the use of <i>any
</i> screening method was better than no screening at all, the study found. 
However, virtual colonoscopy with a 6-millimeter polyp diameter threshold was 
by far the most cost-effective approach: Costs were less than half that of 
traditional colonoscopy when broken down by year of life saved. Even with no 
polyp size threshold, virtual colonoscopy still came in at more than 20 percent 
cheaper. However, Pickhardt noted that the high-tech procedure is not yet 
widely available. (HealthDay News)</p>

<p><b> Emergency medicine to benefit from the HL7&rsquo;s<br>
 first 
registered clinical profile</b></p> 
<p> Health Level Seven (HL7), a healthcare IT standards development 
organization, announced the Emergency Care Functional Profile (EC FM) as the 
first registered profile based upon HL7&rsquo;s EHR System Functional Model 
(EHR-S FM) standard. In late February, the EHR System Functional Model standard 
became the healthcare industry&rsquo;s first ANSI-approved standard to specify 
the functional requirements for an electronic health record system. HL7&rsquo;s 
Emergency Care Special Interest Group (SIG) developed the Emergency Care 
Functional Profile for Emergency Department Information Systems to develop an 
open and objective standard for the development, refinement, and evaluation of 
information systems employed in the ED. As a registered profile, it becomes a 
standard that may be referenced by the Certification Commission for Health 
Information Technology (CCHIT) as a foundation for certification of EHR systems 
in the emergency department setting. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Adopting registered profiles is one way that CCHIT ensures a consistent 
methodology for assessing EHR systems across all healthcare domains. 
Registering profiles that conform to the EHR System Functional Model is an 
important step in the widespread adoption of this standard because technically 
EHR systems conform to profiles rather than the model itself. The Functional 
Model is structured to allow vendors to implement a specific profile for 
real-world settings, such as the Emergency Department, and users to purchase a 
system that conforms to the profile. Registering a profile with HL7 gives the 
profile credibility and approval that it has met a minimum set of guidelines of 
what a profile should contain. &nbsp;</p> 
<h1>  The Emergency Care Functional Profile is not only critical for the 
integration of Emergency Departments (ED) into the developing national health 
information network, but is also needed for&nbsp;handling regional disasters 
such as Hurricane Katrina. The EHR-S Functional Model and the Emergency Care 
Function Profile will facilitate solutions to&nbsp;underlying ED operational 
problems such as overcrowding, ambulance diversion and shortage of services.

<p> <b> FDA causes unnecessary scare about common painkillers</b></p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has caused an unnecessary 
scare about some pain relievers by adding a warning to drugs that are safe, 
said Curt Furberg, M.D., Ph.D., from Wake Forest University School of Medicine. 
At the same time, he says the agency has failed to recognize the harm of a pain 
reliever that should be taken off the market. &ldquo;The FDA is adding 
&lsquo;black box&rsquo; warnings to all prescription and over-the-counter pain 
relievers, even to naproxen, which the evidence shows is safe,&rdquo; said 
Furberg, who serves on the FDA Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory 
Committee. &ldquo;This is based on the false assumption that all nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of heart attacks. In fact, there are 
major differences between these agents.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 In a commentary published by Trials, an online journal of BioMed 
Central, Furberg says the FDA has failed to recognize current scientific 
evidence when it made decisions on the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) that are often used to treat the pain or inflammation from 
arthritis. The most commonly used NSAIDs are ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen 
(Aleve), and diclofenac (Voltaren). There are more than a dozen others, 
including drugs such as celecoxib (Celebrex) that are in a special class known 
as selective COX-2 inhibitors because of the hormone they target. The other 
NSAIDs are known as &ldquo;non-selective.&rdquo; Furberg said while the 
evidence for the non-selective NSAIDs is somewhat limited, an analysis 
combining several small studies found that high doses (500 mg twice daily) of 
Aleve were not associated with an increased risk of heart attacks compared to a 
placebo, or an inactive pill. On the other hand, high doses of Advil (800 mg 
three times a day) and Voltaren (75 mg twice daily) were associated with rates 
of heart attack that were 51 percent and 63 percent higher, respectively, than 
placebo.</p> 
<p> <br>
 An analysis of a large number of trials comparing COX-2 inhibitors 
to other NSAIDs found similar results, that Voltaren was estimated to increase 
vascular risk by about 70 percent over Aleve. &ldquo;Naproxen does not increase 
the risk of heart attacks and ought to be a painkiller of choice,&rdquo; said 
Furberg. &ldquo;On the other hand, Voltaren carries the same risk as the 
harmful COX-2 inhibitors Bextra and Vioxx, which have been taken off the 
market. The FDA has failed to recognize the evidence that the risk of heart 
attack varies substantially among this group of drugs and that Voltaren has the 
highest risk of all. Since it is the most commonly used NSAID, the unrecognized 
harm it has caused worldwide could be enormous.&rdquo;</p> 
<h1> <br>
 The European Regulatory Agency has reviewed the same evidence that 
the FDA considered and reached entirely different conclusions, said Furberg. He 
said this suggests that the decisions are not based on scientific evidence. 
With Celebrex, the FDA didn&rsquo;t follow the recommendations of its Advisory 
Committee to substantially restrict the drug&rsquo;s use. Instead, it required 
only a &ldquo;vaguely worded&rdquo; black box warning, said Furberg. European 
countries require clear warnings for patients at high risk of heart attacks and 
have said COX-2 inhibitors should not be taken by patients with heart disease. 
With the non-selective NSAIDs, Europe has given a &ldquo;clean bill of 
health&rdquo; to the agents and the FDA has judged them to have similar risks 
to Celebrex and is adding &ldquo;black box&rdquo; warnings. &ldquo;Decisions by 
regulatory agencies are expected to follow explicit regulations and should be 
evidence-based,&rdquo; said Furberg. &ldquo;Scientific studies point to 
clinically important differences among the non-selective NSAIDs, which the FDA 
has not recognized. It&rsquo;s time for the FDA to set the record 
straight.&rdquo; For more information seeTHIS LINK.</h1>

U.S. wonders if drug data was accurate </h1> 
<p> <br>
 The Food and Drug Administration is examining whether Eli Lilly 
&amp; Company provided it with accurate data about the side effects of the 
antipsychotic drug Zyprexa, a potent medicine that has been linked to weight 
gain and diabetes. The F.D.A. has questions about a Lilly document from 
February 2000 in which the company found that patients taking Zyprexa in 
clinical trials were three and a half times as likely to develop high blood 
sugar as those who did not take the drug. That document was not submitted to 
the agency. But a few months later, Lilly provided data to the F.D.A. that 
showed almost no difference in blood sugar between patients who took Zyprexa 
and those who did not. The F.D.A. confirmed its inquiry in response to 
questions from The New York Times. The agency said it had not yet decided 
whether to take any action against Lilly. &ldquo;The F.D.A. continues to 
explore the concerns raised recently regarding information provided to the 
F.D.A. on Zyprexa&rsquo;s safety,&rdquo; Dr. Mitchell Mathis, a deputy director 
in the psychiatry division of the agency&rsquo;s center for drug evaluation and 
research, said. A Lilly spokesman, Phil Belt, said the company had rechecked 
its database and found errors in the original statistics. The data submitted 
later was accurate, Belt said. But the 2000 document said that its figures had 
already been checked for error.<i>The Times</i> disclosed the existence of the 
document in an article last December.<br>
<br>
 The discrepancy between 
Lilly&rsquo;s initial data and what it later submitted came at a time when 
Zyprexa&rsquo;s sales were soaring, even as some doctors and foreign regulatory 
agencies were questioning the drug&rsquo;s safety. The F.D.A. has never 
concluded that Zyprexa causes diabetes more than other widely used psychiatric 
drugs, although the American Diabetes Association has. Zyprexa remains 
Lilly&rsquo;s top-selling drug, with $4 billion in worldwide annual sales. But 
prescriptions in the United States have fallen nearly 50 percent since 2003 
amid the safety concerns. Besides the F.D.A. inquiry, Lilly is facing federal 
and state investigations into the way it marketed and promoted Zyprexa. The 
company has already agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle 28,500 lawsuits from 
people who contend that they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking 
the drug. At least 1,200 more lawsuits are pending. Belt, the Lilly spokesman, 
said in a statement that the company properly marketed Zyprexa and disclosed 
its side effects to the F.D.A. and doctors. &ldquo;Lilly always cooperates 
fully with requests for information from the F.D.A.,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and 
that includes any requests regarding information on Zyprexa. Lilly is 
forthcoming with all relevant clinical data on all of our products.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 Lawyers who represent drug companies said the F.D.A. largely 
depended on the companies to be honest about the side effects of their drugs. 
With a staff of fewer than 3,000, including support personnel, the 
agency&rsquo;s drug division oversees more than 12,000 prescription medicines 
and 400 nonprescription drugs. In most cases, said William W. Vodra, senior 
counsel at the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter and a former F.D.A. associate 
chief counsel, it does not perform detailed audits of clinical trials or 
independently check the integrity of the data that companies send to it. 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way they could police the system with the resources 
they have,&rdquo; Vodra said. Robert A. Dormer, a partner in the law firm of 
Hyman, Phelps &amp; McNamara, who represents drug companies, said that the 
companies did not have to provide every analysis they performed to the F.D.A.

<p><b> FDA to test imported additives for melamine</b></p> 
<p> Concerned that a wide variety of Chinese vegetable protein products may be 
contaminated with the harmful compound melamine, the Food and Drug 
Administration said yesterday that it will begin testing batches of six 
imported ingredients used in pet foods and livestock feed, as well as additives 
to human food. Officials have not found the substance in food products for 
people but detected it in two imported ingredients widely used in pet food: 
wheat gluten and rice protein. The agency said that imported corn gluten, corn 
meal, soy protein and rice bran will also be tested. The vegetable proteins are 
used in bread, pizza, baby food and many vegetarian dishes. &ldquo;This is a 
proactive step,&rdquo; said David Acheson, chief medical officer of the FDA 
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. &ldquo;We will test a variety of 
foods and feeds because we need to know all there is to know&rdquo; about the 
melamine contamination. </p> 
<p> Melamine, a nitrogen-based compound used in products such as countertops, 
glues and fertilizers, was identified this month as the cause of fatal kidney 
failure in an unknown number of dogs and cats, leading to the recall of more 
than 100 brands of pet food. Officials traced the melamine to two Chinese 
plants, which have been supplying American distributors since last summer. 
Agency officials said that some contaminated products, sold by pet food 
manufacturers as scraps, were fed to hogs in the Carolinas, New York, California
 and Utah, and that some of those animals tested positive for melamine. They 
said that a contaminated shipment of feed had been sent to a Missouri chicken 
farm as well. Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, said a second chemical called cyanuric acid, which is 
related to melamine, has also been found in samples of rice protein 
concentrate. FDA officials said that they are in discussions with Chinese 
officials about inspecting the plants where the contaminated pet food 
originated, but that no agreement has been reached. Julia Ho, of the 
agency&rsquo;s Office of International Programs, said Chinese authorities also 
are investigating.<br>
<br>
 Steve Miller, chief executive of ChemNutra, a Las 
Vegas-based importer of nutritional and pharmaceutical chemicals, said he 
suspects that the contamination was intentional. &ldquo;We are concerned that 
we may have been the victim of deliberate and mercenary contamination for the 
purpose of making the wheat gluten we purchased appear to have a higher protein 
content than it did, because melamine causes a false high result on protein 
tests,&rdquo; Miller wrote in an open letter posted on ChemNutra&rsquo;s Web 
site. Michael Payne, outreach coordinator for the Western Institute of Food 
Safety at the University of California at Davis's School of Veterinary 
Medicine, said he thinks that there is little risk of people becoming ill by 
eating pork from pigs that ate melamine-laced feed. Toxicology studies on 
laboratory rodents have long suggested that it takes high doses of the chemical 
to cause health problems, typically in the bladder and kidneys, Payne said. And 
the modest doses found in pet food would be diluted even further in the body of 
a pig that ate it. (Washington Post) To read the original article seeTHIS LINK.

<b>New virus discovered; 3 organ transplant recipients in Australia 
succumb to infection</b></p> 
<p> <br>
 The unfortunate deaths of three organ transplant recipients in 
Australia this past January has led to the discovery of a new virus. All three 
had received organs from the same deceased donor in December, and their closely 
spaced deaths suggested their transplants might have exposed them to a deadly 
infectious agent. When investigators at the Victorian Infectious Diseases 
Reference Laboratory in Melbourne applied all the standard tests, however, they 
could not identify any known pathogen. So the Australian team turned to 
scientists at the Greene Infectious Disease Laboratory of the Mailman School of 
Public Health of Columbia University, who have been developing new techniques 
for diagnosing infectious diseases with funds from the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of 
Health.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Partnering with the company 454 Life Sciences, the Columbia 
University team applied a high-throughput technology that can sequence hundreds 
of thousands of bits of DNA simultaneously. Then, using bioinformatics 
algorithms they had created, the team sorted through the data and identified a 
new infectious agent, a virus that was sufficiently different from any known 
virus that it could not have been detected using existing diagnostic methods. 
By assembling additional genetic sequences, the researchers determined that the 
new virus is related to, but distinct from, known strains of lymphocytic 
choreomeningitis virus (LCMV), which has been implicated in a small number of 
cases of disease transmission by organ transplantation. The knowledge of the 
genetic sequence of this new virus will enable improvements in screening that 
may enhance the future safety of organ transplantation. For more information,

Study links faulty DNA repair to Huntington&rsquo;s disease onset
</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Huntington&rsquo;s disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder 
that affects roughly 30,000 Americans, is incurable and fatal. But a new 
discovery about how cells repair their DNA points to a possible way to stop or 
slow the onset of the disease. The research was funded by the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). &ldquo;As so often happens, basic research on a 
fundamental biological process, in this case, enzymes involved in DNA repair, 
leads to new insights about how diseases arise and new approaches for treating 
or preventing them,&rdquo; said NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. The study 
was published April 22 as an Advanced Online Publication in<i>Nature</i> and 
led by Cynthia T. McMurray, Ph.D., a professor of pharmacology at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, MN.<br>
<br>
 Unlike most inherited diseases, 
Huntington&rsquo;s disease symptoms usually don&rsquo;t appear until middle 
age, leading scientists to wonder what triggers the disease onset and whether 
it can be halted, or at least slowed down. People with the disease have a 
version of a gene called huntingtin that carries an extra segment with a 
particular sequence of repeated subunits. If the segment is too large, the gene 
produces a faulty protein that has a destructive effect in the brain. 
&ldquo;Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a progressive disease, but nobody knows 
exactly why,&rdquo; said McMurray. &ldquo;Our work supports the idea that the 
disease progresses when the extra segment expands over time in non-dividing 
cells such as nerve cells.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> McMurray&rsquo;s study shows that the inserted segment grows when cells 
try to remove oxidative lesions, which are caused by byproducts of the oxygen 
we breathe. DNA repair enzymes initially keep oxidative lesions in check, but 
over time, increasing numbers of lesions overwhelm the repair systems. 
Oxidative lesions also accumulate in people who do not have Huntington&rsquo;s 
disease, but because their huntingtin gene lacks the extra segment it is not 
prone to expansion. While scientists have long suspected that oxidative lesions 
play a role in Huntington&rsquo;s disease, the specific role of the lesions has 
remained elusive until now.</p> 
<p> <br>
 To show that the extra segment enlarges with age, the researchers 
engineered mice to carry a version of the human huntingtin gene with an 
inserted segment, one large enough to cause Huntington&rsquo;s disease in 
humans. After a few months, when the mice had aged, the scientists analyzed the 
gene and found that the segment had expanded. They also observed an increase in 
oxidative lesions in the mouse DNA. To see if the oxidative lesions played a 
role in expansion of the extra DNA segment, the researchers next deleted OGG1, 
a key enzyme in oxidative lesion repair. Without OGG1, the bulk of the 
DNA&rsquo;s oxidative lesions remained untouched, and the inserted segment did 
not grow at all or it grew far less than in mice carrying a working version of 
OGG1.</p> 
<h2> <br>
 These findings show that while doing its part in removing oxidative 
lesions, OGG1 triggers a far more damaging effect, the DNA expansion associated 
with Huntington&rsquo;s disease. &ldquo;The effect is much like what might 
happen if a technician came to repair a minor defect in your computer but was 
called away by a more urgent problem midway through the process. Now your 
computer is lying in pieces and you&rsquo;re unable to use it,&rdquo; said 
McMurray. The study suggests that OGG1 might offer a target for the development 
of new Huntington&rsquo;s disease treatments. McMurray&rsquo;s team is already 
pursuing this path and is screening for small molecules that block OGG1 
function. This work may also be relevant to research on other diseases, such as 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s, in which oxidative lesions are 
believed to play a role. </h2>

 Medicare Trustees release annual report &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> 
<p> The new Medicare Trustees Report shows that while Medicare&rsquo;s 
financial outlook remains troubling, the program&rsquo;s outlook has improved 
slightly compared to last year&rsquo;s estimate.&nbsp;The Trustees note that 
Medicare expenditures were $408 billion in 2006, or 3.1 percent of gross 
domestic product (GDP), and are projected to increase to over 11 percent of GDP 
in 75 years. HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt said the report points to the need to 
act quickly and efficiently to strengthen and improve Medicare, including 
enactment of the steps proposed in the President&rsquo;s budget to address 
Medicare&rsquo;s fiscal health.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We are already beginning to implement steps to protect Medicare for 
future generations,&rdquo; said Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services 
Acting Administrator Leslie V. Norwalk. &ldquo;Medicare is now providing 
up-to-date preventive benefits and comprehensive drug coverage and is 
developing better information on quality and costs of healthcare to ensure that 
we pay appropriately for the healthcare of our beneficiaries.&nbsp;A critical 
element of this process is the movement we have underway for Medicare to change 
from being a passive payer of services to becoming an active purchaser of 
high-quality, efficient care. Until those steps are fully implemented, 
today&rsquo;s report starkly demonstrates the need to act to change 
Medicare&rsquo;s current growth trajectory.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> In the estimate, Medicare&rsquo;s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is 
projected to be exhausted in 2019, one year later than estimated in last year's 
report. This change results from slightly higher projected income and slightly 
lower projected expenditures than shown in last year&rsquo;s report. HI 
expenditure growth is estimated to average 7.2&nbsp;percent per year over the 
next 10 years.&nbsp;Because of continued rapid growth in expenditures for the 
program as a whole, program costs financed by general revenues, rather than by 
&ldquo;dedicated revenues,&rdquo; are projected to exceed 45 percent in 
2013.&nbsp;Because this result falls within the first seven years of the 
projection period (2007-2013), the Trustees have issued a determination of 
&ldquo;excess general revenue Medicare funding.&rdquo;&nbsp;This determination 
has now been made in two consecutive years, triggering a &ldquo;Medicare 
funding warning.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> An element of good news in this year&rsquo;s Trustees Report involves the 
new prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. The latest cost 
projections for Part D through 2015 are 13 percent lower than estimated in last 
year&rsquo;s report (and substantially lower than the original estimates from 
2003).&nbsp;Plan bids for 2007 were 10 percent lower than in 2006, as a result 
of intense competition among plans to attract and retain enrollees and 
plans&rsquo; expectations to further increase use of inexpensive generic drugs, 
rather than more costly brand-name equivalents.&nbsp;In addition, overall 
prescription drug costs have increased much more slowly during 2004-2006 than 
in prior years.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Human bird flu deaths reported in Egypt, Cambodia; <br>

<p> <br>
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed two new human 
cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Egypt and 
another case in Cambodia, the first to be confirmed in that country in 2007. 
The Cambodian Ministry of Health said the 13-year-old girl, from Ponhea Kreak 
district in Kampong Cham province, developed symptoms April 2, was hospitalized 
the next day and died April 5. Samples from the girl tested positive for H5N1 
at the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh. Sick and dead poultry were reported in 
the village in recent weeks, according to WHO, and the girl reportedly had 
eaten part of a sick chicken before she became ill. A team from the Ministry of 
Health, WHO and the Pasteur Institute there are following up with the 
girl&rsquo;s contacts and conducting awareness-raising activities in the area. 
Of seven cases confirmed in Cambodia, all have been fatal. In Egypt, the 
Ministry of Health and Population announced two new human H5N1 cases that were 
confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory and U.S. Naval 
Medical Research Unit No.3 in Cairo. A 2-year-old female from Menia Governorate 
developed symptoms April 3 and the next day was admitted to a hospital where 
she is in stable condition. Investigations show that she had contact with 
backyard poultry. Another girl, a 15-year-old female from Cairo Governorate, 
developed symptoms March 30, was admitted to the hospital April 5 and died 
April 10. Of 34 cases confirmed in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The announcement brings to 291 the total number of human cases 
confirmed by WHO since 2003, with 172 deaths. These totals include all 
countries except Indonesia, which since January has not shared virus samples 
from infected people with WHO collaborating centers and does not have a public 
health laboratory that WHO has certified to confirm human cases of the H5N1 
strain of avian flu. On March 27, after a two-day meeting in Jakarta, 
Indonesia, among officials from WHO and 20 nations that have had animal and 
human H5N1 outbreaks, WHO agreed not to share virus samples with vaccine makers 
without approval from the virus-collecting country, and the government of 
Indonesia agreed to resume sharing H5N1 virus samples. The meeting endorsed 
WHO&rsquo;s efforts to link vaccine manufacturers in developed and developing 
countries to speed the transfer of technology to manufacture influenza vaccine. 
Individual countries will negotiate how vaccine is made available to them. So 
far, WHO has not yet received samples from Indonesia.</p> 
<p>  WHO can confirm that Indonesia has had 81 avian flu cases since 2003 and 
63 deaths, but news reports put the total at 94, with 74 deaths. China also has 
been withholding virus samples from infected people since April 2006 for 
unknown reasons, but its H5N1 case count is up to date at WHO. &ldquo;We have 
confirmed China&rsquo;s cases,&rdquo; said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl, 
&ldquo;because if the national laboratory has been certified as being able to 
do H5N1 testing and it undergoes periodic review, then we will accept their 
national certification or report.&rdquo; On April 25, WHO is scheduled to hold 
another meeting in Geneva to focus on ways to increase developing-country 
access to potential pandemic vaccines. The gathering will bring together 
representatives from WHO, countries affected by H5N1, vaccine manufacturers and 
donors to discuss strategies for vaccine production and access. According to 
WHO, potential outcomes include an agreement on ways to increase access to

<h1> Overcrowded hospitals may risk adverse events on busiest days</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Hospitals that operate at or over their capacity may be at increased 
risk of adverse events that injure patients, according to a study led by 
investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and 
Woman&rsquo;s Hospital (BWH). The report in the May issue of the journal<i>
Medical Care</i> suggests that efforts to meet two primary challenges facing 
hospitals today, reducing costs and improving patient safety, may work against 
each other. &ldquo;While financial and political pressures to make health care 
more efficient are leading to increased hospital occupancy and greater patient 
turnover, patients and policymakers are quite rightly demanding that health 
delivery systems be made safer,&rdquo; said Joel Weissman, PhD, of the MGH 
Institute of Health Policy, the report&rsquo;s lead author. &ldquo;Our study 
suggests that pushing efficiency efforts to their limits could be a 
double-edged sword that may jeopardize patient safety.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In order to examine their hypothesis that increased workload could raise 
the likelihood of adverse events, the investigators examined data from four 
hospitals in two states, two large urban teaching hospitals and two suburban 
teaching hospitals, over the 12 months from October 2000 through September 
2001. To compile patient care information they reviewed patient charts and 
billing records on almost 25,000 patients, selecting 6,841 for comprehensive 
review, and analyzed that data against information on hospital workloads and 
staffing patterns, with a focus on variations within each hospital. From the 
nearly 7,000 records receiving detailed review, 1,530 adverse events, defined 
as preventable injuries not resulting from patients&rsquo; underlying medical 
condition, were identified. The most common such events were wound infections 
and adverse drug events. At three of the four hospitals, the rate of adverse 
events did not appear to increase at times of peak workload. But at the fourth, 
a major urban teaching hospital with consistently high occupancy rates, 
exceeding 100 percent for more than three months, workload increases and higher 
patient-to-nurse ratios were associated with more adverse events.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;While we looked at only four hospitals, which limits the ability to 
generalize these findings, the hospital where we found a relationship between 
working conditions and adverse events was disproportionately crowded for much 
of the study period,&rdquo; said &nbsp;study co-author Eran Bendavid, MD. 
&ldquo;That suggests hospitals operating at the high end of their capacity may 
need to examine safety systems with an eye towards coping with periods of high 
stress.&rdquo; Formerly with the MGH Institute of Health Policy, Bendavid is 
now at the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University. &ldquo;This study 
helps quantify the impression that many clinicians have and confirms that 
systems perform poorly when they are overloaded,&rdquo; said study co-author 
David Bates, MD, MSc, of the BWH Division of General Medicine and Primary Care. 
&ldquo;Future research should address approaches for distributing workload and 
examine the effectiveness of strategies to improve safety in high-workload 
situations.&rdquo;</p>

<b>Drug company sales visits influenced doctors, study finds</b></p> 
<h1> <br>
 Almost half of sales visits by pharmaceutical company 
representatives advocating the use of the drug gabapentin led to doctors 
stating that they intended to increase their prescription of the drug or 
recommend it to colleagues, according to an analysis of a survey completed by 
the doctors shortly after the visits. Nearly 40 percent of the visits involved 
discussion of so-called &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses of the drug not approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration, say the authors of the study. At the time 
of the visits, gabapentin was approved only for secondary treatment of a 
certain form of epilepsy. Off-label uses included treatment of pain, migraine, 
and psychiatric conditions.</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  &ldquo;The increased intention to prescribe after these sales visits is 
remarkable, and is in fact greater than has been observed in other 
studies,&rdquo; said lead author Michael A. Steinman, MD, a staff physician at 
the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC). The senior author is Lisa Bero, 
PhD, professor of clinical pharmacy and health policy studies at the University 
of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and an expert on pharmaceutical industry 
marketing practices. The study appears in the April 24, 2007 issue of<i>PLoS 
Medicine</i>. The authors analyzed a survey form that chronicled 116 visits to 
97 physicians by pharmaceutical sales representatives from 1995 to 1999. The 
forms were collected by a market research firm and became available to the 
researchers as the result of a lawsuit against Parke-Davis, the maker of 
gabapentin. The lawsuit was brought by a former employee who alleged that the 
company promoted gabapentin, which it sold under the name Neurontin, for uses 
not officially approved by the FDA.</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  &ldquo;To me, the remarkable thing is how effective a very brief visit 
by a drug representative, most often less than five minutes, can be in 
influencing physicians&rsquo; choices to use a drug for an unapproved 
indication,&rdquo; Bero said. After 46 percent of the visits, the doctors 
expressed the intention to increase either their prescribing of gabapentin or 
their recommendations that their colleagues prescribe the drug. During 39 
percent of visits, the sales representative either gave or promised free drug 
samples to the doctor, said Steinman, who is also an assistant professor of 
medicine at UCSF.&nbsp; During 38 percent of the visits, the &ldquo;main 
message&rdquo; involved discussion of at least one use of gabapentin that was 
not approved by the FDA at the time, he says. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say for 
sure whether these off-label uses were brought up by the sales representatives 
or the physicians,&rdquo; cautions Steinman, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s clear there 
was extensive discussion of uses that were not approved by the FDA, which, in 
general, sales representatives are prohibited from discussing in an unsolicited 
manner.&rdquo;</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  Steinman notes that physicians were just as likely to say they intended 
to increase prescription of gabapentin whether or not visits included mention 
of off-label use. Neither the duration of visit nor the visit&rsquo;s perceived 
educational value made any detectable difference in intention to prescribe, he 
said. There was no indication of whether the physicians followed up on their 
stated intention to prescribe more gabapentin, he said. Steinman speculates 
that the real effectiveness of pharmaceutical sales visits lies primarily in 
the &ldquo;relationship-building&rdquo; that occurs during those visits. 
&ldquo;Aside from free drug samples, the representative will often bring a 
gift, lunch for the doctor and his or her staff, new pens and coffee mugs, 
offers to attend an educational conference. As a result, the doctor feels 
subtly, even subconsciously, indebted to the representative. This can lead to 
higher prescribing.&rdquo;&nbsp; </h1>

Neither abortion nor miscarriage associated with breast cancer risk
</b></p> 
<p>Neither induced abortion nor spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) appears to 
be associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women, according to a 
report in the April 23 issue of<i>Archives of Internal Medicine</i>. Women 
younger than age 35 who carry a pregnancy to term appear to have a reduced 
lifetime risk of breast cancer, according to background information in the 
article. Pregnancy may accelerate breast cell differentiation, the process by 
which cells take on specialized roles. &ldquo;An incomplete pregnancy may not 
result in sufficient differentiation to counter the high levels of pregnancy 
hormones that may foster proliferation,&rdquo; the rapid growth and division 
typical of cancer cells, the authors write. &ldquo;However, these biological 
mechanisms are uncertain, and a prematurely terminated pregnancy may not affect 
breast cancer risk at all.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Karin B. Michels, Sc.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at Brigham and Women&rsquo;s 
Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, 
examined the association between abortion and breast cancer in 105,716 women 
who were part of the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study II (NHSII). A total of 16,118 
participants (15 percent) reported having a history of induced abortion and 
21,753 (21 percent) had a history of spontaneous abortion. Between 1993 and 
2003, 1,458 new cases of breast cancer occurred among the women. &ldquo;In this 
cohort study of young women, we found no association between induced abortion 
and breast cancer incidence and a suggestion of an inverse association between 
spontaneous abortion and breast cancer incidence during 10 years of 
follow-up,&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;We observed associations in two 
subgroups, an association between induced abortion and progesterone 
receptor&ndash;negative breast cancer [cancer that does not respond to the 
hormone progesterone] and an inverse association between spontaneous abortion 
before the age of 20 years and breast cancer incidence,&rdquo; they continue.
</p> 
<p>However, they caution that these secondary analyses are based on small 
numbers of women. &ldquo;No obvious mechanisms can be provided for these 
subgroup findings; thus, chance has to be considered as a possible 
explanation.&rdquo; A 2003 international expert panel convened by the National 
Cancer Institute reviewed and assessed research regarding reproductive events 
and the risk of breast cancer, and concluded that based on existing evidence, 
induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. 
&ldquo;The data from the NHSII provide further evidence of a lack of an 
important overall association between induced or spontaneous abortions and risk 
of breast cancer,&rdquo; the authors conclude. &ldquo;Among this predominantly 
pre-menopausal population, neither induced nor spontaneous abortion was 
associated with the incidence of breast cancer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>One in four hospital patients is admitted with a mental health or 
substance abuse disorder</b></p> 
<p>Almost one-fourth of all stays in U.S. community hospitals for patients age 
18 and older, 7.6 million of nearly 32 million stays, involved depressive, 
bipolar, schizophrenia and other mental health disorders or substance use 
related disorders in 2004, according to a new report by HHS&rsquo; Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality. This study presents the first documentation of 
the full impact of mental health and substance abuse disorders on U.S. 
community hospitals. According to the report, about 1.9 million of the 7.6 
million stays were for patients who were hospitalized primarily because of a 
mental health or substance abuse problem. In the other 5.7 million stays, 
patients were admitted for another condition but they also were diagnosed as 
having a mental health or substance abuse disorder. Nearly two-thirds of costs 
were billed to the government: Medicare covered nearly half of the stays, and 
18 percent were billed to Medicaid. Roughly 8 percent of the patients were 
uninsured. Private insurers were billed for the balance. The study also found 
that one of every three stays of uninsured patients was related to a mental 
health or substance abuse disorder.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Community hospitals play an important role in the treatment of 
people with mental health and substance abuse disorders,&rdquo; said AHRQ 
Director Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;This report gives healthcare 
policymakers an in-depth look at the impact of mental health and substance 
abuse care on the healthcare system.&rdquo; Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration Administrator Terry Cline, Ph.D., said, &ldquo;The 
significant number of hospital stays related to mental health and substance use 
disorders signals the need for an increased national effort to identify and 
intervene early before the conditions require a hospital stay. Too often 
because of social stigma or lack of understanding, individuals and health care 
providers don't recognize the signs or treat mental health or substance use 
disorders with the same urgency as other medical conditions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>AHRQ found that most patients with mental health and substance abuse 
disorders were older. For example, although people age 80 and older comprised 
only 5 percent of the U.S. population in 2004, they accounted for nearly 21 
percent of all hospital stays for these conditions, principally for dementia. 
There were also gender differences. The most frequent admitting diagnosis for 
women was mood disorders, while that for men was substance abuse. AHRQ also 
found that patients who have been diagnosed with both a mental health condition 
and a substance abuse disorder, those with &ldquo;dual diagnoses&rdquo;, 
accounted for 1 million of the nearly 8 million stays. Nearly half of these 
cases with dual diagnoses involved drug abuse, a third involved alcohol abuse, 
and one in five involved both drug and alcohol abuse.</p> 
<p>In addition, 240,000 women hospitalized for childbirth or pregnancy also 
had mental health or substance abuse problems. Four of every 10 of these 
patients were between 18 and 24 years of age. Suicide attempts accounted for 
nearly 179,000 hospital stays. Of these, 93 percent involved a mental health 
condition, most commonly mood disorders, and/or substance abuse. Nearly 
three-quarters of these patients were between ages 18 and 44 and more than half 
were women. Poisoning, by overdosing prescription medicines or ingesting a 
toxic substance was the most common way patients attempted suicide. The report 
is based on 2004 data, the latest currently available, from AHRQ&rsquo;s 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a database 
of hospital inpatient stays that is nationally representative of all 
short-term, non-federal hospitals. The data are drawn from hospitals that 
comprise 90 percent of all discharges in the United States and include all 
patients, regardless of insurance type, as well as the uninsured. For more

<p><b> GHX develops collaborative contract commitment tool for&nbsp; the 
healthcare supply chain</b><i>  &nbsp;</i></p> 
<p>  GHX has extended the functionality of its Contract Center to include a 
collaborative contract commitment module that can be utilized by all providers, 
manufacturers, distributors, and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the 
healthcare supply chain.&nbsp; More than sixty hospitals have already 
successfully used the tool to activate hundreds of contracts negotiated by 
HealthTrust Purchasing Group with Medtronic, Boston Scientific Corporation, and 
St. Jude Medical. Johnson and Johnson Healthcare Systems Inc. will begin 
utilizing the contract commitment module later this year. Cardinal Health has 
also expressed support for a single industry solution for contract commitment.
</p> 
<p>  Effective contract management requires that all authorized parties to a 
contract share accurate information related to factors such as tier pricing and 
commitments, customer eligibility, and effective contract dates in a timely 
manner. When that information is inconsistent or delayed, errors can occur that 
not only create rework and higher labor costs but also may result in financial 
losses for the various parties as the result of inaccurate pricing, rebates and 
chargebacks. The GHX Contract Commitment Module addresses these issues by 
automating what has traditionally been a highly manual process and by enabling 
manufacturers, distributors, GPOs, and healthcare providers to agree on key 
contract terms and conditions up front. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  These process improvements help ensure greater accuracy in both 
transactions and reporting related to contract purchases, whether they are 
through a GPO or direct with a manufacturer. GPOs can provide manufacturers 
with data on contract terms and conditions, including tier pricing, 
definitions, and requirements, as well as which customers are eligible for 
various contracts. Hospitals and other healthcare providers can then utilize 
the tool to activate contracts, with manufacturer approval and agreement on 
effective dates occurring in a collaborative online environment. For more

<p> <b> Medicaid programs &lsquo;severely challenged,&rsquo; report says</b>
</p> 
<h1> <br>
 State Medicaid programs vary wildly in their eligibility criteria, 
the scope and quality of their care, and the amount they reimburse physicians 
providing it, according to an independent assessment published last week. 
Overall, the programs are &ldquo;severely challenged,&rdquo; with the best 
scoring the equivalent of a low D and the worst way below an F. &ldquo;This 
evaluation demonstrates a bleak picture for millions of people in many 
states,&rdquo; wrote the authors of the 143-page evaluation, produced by Public 
Citizen&rsquo;s Health Research Group. The top five programs, in order of rank, 
were in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Vermont, Alaska and Wisconsin. The bottom 
five, with lowest-ranked last, were in South Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Idaho and 
Mississippi. Maryland ranked 15, the District 27, and Virginia 37. Beyond the 
minimum specified services that the federal government mandates state Medicaid 
programs to provide, states may choose to expand coverage for other services. 
For example, all states and the District also choose to cover uninsured poor 
women needing care for breast or cervical cancer. Thirteen states and the 
District also cover uninsured people with tuberculosis.<br>
 &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  The anecdotal differences between states can be dramatic. For example, a 
pregnant woman in a family of three must have a household income of less than 
$22,128 to qualify for Medicaid in Wyoming. In Minnesota, she could qualify 
with an income of $45,650, according to the report. &ldquo;We know that the 
differences between programs reflect both differences in priorities and 
resources, but nobody knows the extent of them. The programs haven&rsquo;t been 
subjected to a uniform scoring scheme,&rdquo; said Annette B. Ramirez de 
Arellano, a health-policy expert who headed the project. The authors used 
published data to measure Medicaid performance in 55 areas. In calculating a 
final score out of a possible 1,000 points, they weighted issues of eligibility 
and reimbursement more heavily than breadth of services and quality of care. 
The highest- and lowest-ranked states differed in their scores by a factor of 
two, 646 for Massachusetts vs. 318 for Mississippi. There was even more 
variation in the components that went into the total scores. For example, the 
top-ranked state for the breadth of its eligibility criteria (Rhode Island) 
scored 3.3 times higher than the lowest-ranked state (Indiana) in that 
category. In the reimbursement component of the score, there was a 20-fold 
difference between Alaska, which had the most generous reimbursement, and New 
Jersey, which had the least. &ldquo;Most of the states are failing in one or 
more areas, and some of them are failing in most areas,&rdquo; Ramirez de 
Arellano said.</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  Public Citizen&rsquo;s Health Research Group did a similar analysis and 
ranking 20 years ago. Four states in the top 10 now were in the top 10 then. 
Five states in the bottom 10 now were in the bottom 10 then. The authors 
admitted they were operating off incomplete information on many subjects, which 
made their task difficult. For example, the quality assessment was largely 
based on nursing home performance and the success of childhood immunizations, 
although Medicaid pays for the entire range of medical care. The reimbursement 
comparisons were based only on Medicaid programs using a fee-for-service 
payment scheme. However, 60 percent of Medicaid patients are in managed-care 
schemes in which physicians or clinics get a flat fee to provide all medical 
services to a client. Alan Weil, executive director of the National Academy for 
State Health Policy, said the report fails to capture Medicaid&rsquo;s cutting 
edge, experimental coverage programs, managed-care reimbursement schemes and 
home-based care, because there are no data collected in all states that can 
serve as grounds for comparing those components. (Washington Post) </h1>

In turnabout, infant deaths climb in South </h1> 
<p> <br>
 For decades, Mississippi and neighboring states with large black 
populations and expanses of enduring poverty made steady progress in reducing 
infant death. But, in what health experts call an ominous portent, progress has 
stalled and in recent years the death rate has risen in Mississippi and several 
other states. The setbacks have raised questions about the impact of cuts in 
welfare and Medicaid and of poor access to doctors, and, many doctors say, the 
growing epidemics of obesity, diabetes and hypertension among potential 
mothers, some of whom tip the scales here at 300 to 400 pounds. &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t think the rise is a fluke, and it&rsquo;s a disturbing trend, not 
only in Mississippi but throughout the Southeast,&rdquo; said Dr. Christina 
Glick, a neonatologist in Jackson, MI, and past president of the National 
Perinatal Association. To the shock of Mississippi officials, who in 2004 had 
seen the infant mortality rate, defined as deaths by the age of 1 year per 
thousand live births, fall to 9.7, the rate jumped sharply in 2005, to 11.4. 
The national average in 2003, the last year for which data have been compiled, 
was 6.9.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Smaller rises also occurred in 2005 in Alabama, North Carolina and 
Tennessee. Louisiana and South Carolina saw rises in 2004 and have not yet 
reported on 2005. Whether the rises continue or not, federal officials say, 
rates have stagnated in the Deep South at levels well above the national 
average. Most striking, here and throughout the country, is the large racial 
disparity. In Mississippi, infant deaths among blacks rose to 17 per thousand 
births in 2005 from 14.2 per thousand in 2004, while those among whites rose to 
6.6 per thousand from 6.1. (The national average in 2003 was 5.7 for whites and 
14.0 for blacks.) The overall jump in Mississippi meant that 65 more babies 
died in 2005 than in the previous year, for a total of 481. The main causes of 
infant death in poor Southern regions included premature and low-weight births; 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, which is linked to parental smoking and unsafe 
sleeping positions as well as unknown causes; congenital defects; and, among 
poor black teenage mothers in particular, deaths from accidents and disease. 
Dr. William Langston, an obstetrician at the Mississippi Department of Health, 
said that officials could not yet explain the sudden increase and were 
investigating. Dr. Langston said the state was working to extend prenatal care 
and was experimenting with new outreach programs. But, he added, 
&ldquo;programs take money, and Mississippi is the poorest state in the 
nation.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In the past 10 years, the infant mortality rate for blacks in most of the 
Delta has averaged about 14 per thousand in some counties and more than 20 per 
thousand in others. But Sharkey County, one of the poorest, has had a 
startlingly different record. From 1991 through 2005, the rate for blacks 
hovered at around 5 per thousand. State officials say the county&rsquo;s 
population is too small, it registers only 100 births a year, to be 
statistically significant. But many experts feel it is no coincidence that a 
steep drop in infant deaths followed the start of an intensive home-visiting 
system run by the Cary Christian Center, using local mothers as counselors. The 
program, which is paid for with private money, buses nearly all pregnant blacks 
in Sharkey and a small neighboring county to pre- and postnatal classes. (The

<b>FDA was aware of dangers to food; <br>
 outbreaks were not 
preventable, officials say</b></p> 
<p> The Food and Drug Administration has known for years about contamination 
problems at a Georgia peanut butter plant and on  California spinach farms that 
led to disease outbreaks that killed three people, sickened hundreds, and 
forced one of the biggest product recalls in U.S. history, documents and 
interviews show. Overwhelmed by huge growth in the number of food processors 
and imports, however, the agency took only limited steps to address the 
problems and relied on producers to police themselves, according to agency 
documents. Congressional critics and consumer advocates said both episodes show 
that the agency is incapable of adequately protecting the safety of the food 
supply. FDA officials conceded that the agency&rsquo;s system needs to be 
overhauled to meet today&rsquo;s demands, but contended that the agency could 
not have done anything to prevent either contamination episode.<br>
<br>
 Last 
week, the FDA notified California state health officials that hogs on a farm in 
the state had likely eaten feed laced with melamine, an industrial chemical 
blamed for the deaths of dozens of pets in recent weeks. Officials are trying 
to determine whether the chemical&rsquo;s presence in the hogs represents a 
threat to humans. Pork from animals raised on the farm has been recalled. The 
FDA has said its inspectors probably would not have found the contaminated food 
before problems arose. The tainted additive caused a recall of more than 100 
different brands of pet food. The outbreaks point to a need to change the way 
the agency does business, said Robert E. Brackett, director of the FDA&rsquo;s 
food-safety arm, which is responsible for safeguarding 80 percent of the 
nation&rsquo;s food supply. &ldquo;We have 60,000 to 80,000 facilities that 
we&rsquo;re responsible for in any given year,&rdquo; Brackett said. Explosive 
growth in the number of processors and the amount of imported foods means that 
manufacturers &ldquo;have to build safety into their products rather than us 
chasing after them,&rdquo; Brackett said. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tomorrow, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing on 
the unprecedented spate of recalls. Rep. John D. Dingell (D-MI), chairman of 
the full House committee is considering introducing legislation to boost the 
agency&rsquo;s accountability, regulatory authority and budget. According to 
Caroline Smith DeWaal, who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 
a consumer-advocacy group, &ldquo;When budgets are tight... the food program at 
FDA gets hit the hardest.&rdquo; In next year&rsquo;s budget, passed amid 
discovery of contamination problems in spinach, tomatoes and lettuce, Congress 
has voted the FDA a $10 million increase to improve food safety, DeWaal said. 
The  Agriculture Department, which monitors meat, poultry and eggs and keeps 
inspectors in every processing plant, got an increase 10 times that amount to 
help pay for its inspection programs. The FDA visits problem food plants about 
once a year and the rest far less frequently, Brackett said. (Washington Post)

<h3> FDA to consider approval of first CCR5 antagonist against HIV/AIDS</h3> 
<p>  An advisory panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 
meeting this week to decide whether to recommend approval of Pfizer&rsquo;s 
HIV/AIDS drug Maraviroc for patients already taking other drugs. If approved, 
it will be the first drug available in the class called CCR5 antagonists. Many 
HIV drugs fight the virus from inside infected white blood cells. CCR5 
antagonists stop the virus from getting into cells by blocking the main entry 
point common to most people who have the infection. CCR5 stands for chemokine 
(C-C motif) receptor 5. HIV uses it as a co-receptor to get into target cells: 
the CD4 T-cells or helper cells, the main coordinators of the immune system. 
When the co-receptor &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the HIV virus it signals to the main 
CD4 cell receptor to allow the HIV antigen into the target T-cell.<br>
<br>
 By 
blocking the CCR5 co-receptor, CCR5 antagonists stop strains of HIV known as 
&ldquo;R5-tropic&rdquo;, an HIV variant that is common in earlier infection. 
However, as the disease progresses, the virus adapts to use an alternative 
entry point, the CXR4 receptor. In February, Pfizer announced that marketing 
authorization applications for Maraviroc were receiving accelerated review in 
both the US and Europe. The marketing applications for Maraviroc are supported 
by efficacy and safety data from two phase 3 trials. Named MOTIVATE-1 and 2 
(Maraviroc plus Optimized Therapy In Viremic Antiretroviral 
Treatment-Experienced patients), the trials show 24 weeks of data comparing 
Optimized Background Therapy, with or without Maraviroc, in over 1,000 highly 
treatment-experienced patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The HIV virus was 
suppressed in 45 percent of the patients, compared with 23 percent who took a 
placebo. Maraviroc and the placebos were taken in combination with other drugs. 
According to Pfizer, these trial results have been accepted for presentation at 
a forthcoming HIV conference.<br>
<br>
 CCR5 antagonists have raised safety 
concerns in the past. Earlier drugs under development were linked to lymphoma 
and liver damage. These risks did not appear to be significant in the Pfizer 
studies, but according to media reports, the FDA reviewers are concerned about 
modest increases in liver damage. Other drug companies are also working on CCR5 
antagonists. Nobody knows what the long term effect of using CCR5 antagonists 
will be. Some have speculated that it will accelerate the development of new 
strains of HIV that use other entry points. Early trials have suggested not, 
but it highlights the importance of keeping an eye on the impact of the drug 
over the coming years should it pass the FDA and European approval. According 
to researchers on the Pfizer trials, the priority now is to get the drug to the 
people who are running out of options. The longer term effects will not be 
known until the drug has been used for 5 to 10 years. (Medical News Today)<br>

<h1> Physicians should be able to review performance rates before release</h1> 
<p> <br>
 A policy paper and principles assuring that physicians are given the 
opportunity to comment on performance ratings that they believe are inaccurate 
were adopted this week by the American College of Physicians (ACP) at its 
annual meeting April 19-21 in San Diego. The principles, part of the paper 
&ldquo;Developing a Fair Process Through Which Physicians Participating in 
Performance Measurement Programs Can Request a Reconsideration of Their 
Ratings&rdquo;, also address performance ratings that do not take into account 
the characteristics of the practice or patient population being treated prior 
to the release of ratings to the public.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Accurate reports of physician performance will allow physicians to 
effectively assess and improve their performance, and enable consumers and 
purchasers to make informed decisions concerning treatments, coverage and the 
quality of care. The principles, ACP says, should be considered in tandem with 
other organizational principles on developing measures; sharing, aggregating, 
and reporting data; and the ethics of physician performance measurement. 
Performance data should be used for public reporting or to determine physician 
payment only after data are fully adjusted for case-mix composition, including 
age, severity of illness, co-morbidities, and other features of a 
physician&rsquo;s practice and patient population that may influence the 
results. &ldquo;A fair and accurate reconsideration process is yet another way 
to minimize unintended consequences that may compromise the care of the 
patient,&rdquo; said ACP President Lynne M. Kirk, MD, FACP. &ldquo;These 
principles reflect the importance of balancing stakeholders&rsquo; urgent need 
for useful information with the need for due diligence to ensure that the 
information provided is valid, reliable, and useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Antibiotics not necessary to treat most abscesses, <br>
 even in the 
presence of MRSA</p> 
<p> <br>
 A 30-year review of the medical literature concerning a common skin 
infection reveals that abscesses treated by simple incision and drainage heal 
just as well as those treated with incision, drainage and antibiotics.&nbsp;An 
article appearing online in the<em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> finds 
that, except in cases where cellulitis is present, abscesses can be treated 
successfully without antibiotics, even in an environment heavily contaminated 
with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (&ldquo;Are Antibiotics 
Necessary After Incision and Drainage of a Cutaneous Abscess?&rdquo;). 
&ldquo;The typical treatment for an emergency patient with a skin abscess is 
incision, drainage and antibiotics, but it looks like incision and drainage 
alone are enough,&rdquo; said study author Worth W. Everett, MD, of the 
University of Pennsylvania Department of Emergency Medicine.&nbsp;&ldquo;Given 
widespread concerns about antibiotic misuse and antibiotic resistance, this 
could change how we treat this very common emergency department complaint for 
both adults and children.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> MRSA, a powerful Staph infection sometimes referred to as a 
&ldquo;superbug,&rdquo; has proliferated recently in many public settings, 
including hospitals and healthcare facilities.&nbsp;MRSA&rsquo;s resistance to 
many antibiotics and potential to cause harm to people with both normal and 
compromised immune systems have raised alarm among many healthcare workers. 
&ldquo;Patients tend to clamor for antibiotics, even in situations where the 
evidence is clear that they are ineffective, such as with the common cold or 
the flu,&rdquo; said Dr. Everett.&nbsp;&ldquo;The body has a tremendous ability 
to heal itself over time, and we can now see that this includes skin abscesses, 
at least those that do not include cellulitis.&nbsp;The current research simply 
does not support the routine practice of prescribing antibiotics following 
incision and drainage of simple abscesses.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has solicited proposals to 
study on a broader scale how to treat skin and soft tissue infections, 
including abscesses, and whether antibiotics are necessary. &ldquo;Every study 
we looked at came to the same conclusion: abscesses treated with incision and 
drainage alone healed at the same rate as abscesses treated with incision, 
drainage and antibiotics,&rdquo; said Dr. Everett.&nbsp;&ldquo;If the 
anticipated NIH study supports the findings of the last 30 years, this may help 
stem the tide of antibiotic overuse.&nbsp;The next step, of course, will be to 
reinforce to the public the message that they don't need antibiotics to treat 
every ailment.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p>

<h2> CDC launches new home page and other Web site improvements<br>
 &nbsp;
</h2> 
<p> &lsquo;Bird Flu&rsquo; genome study shows new strains, Western spread</p> 
<p> In a paper in the May issue of <em>  Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>, an 
international team of researchers report the first ever large-scale sequencing 
of western genomes of the deadly avian influenza virus, H5N1. Their study of 36 
genomes of the virus collected from wild birds in Europe, the Middle East and 
Africa (EMA), and Vietnam confirms not only that the virus has very recently 
spread west from Asia, but that two of the new western strains have already 
independently combined, or reassorted, to create a new strain. Several samples 
also contained the mutation associated with the form of the &ldquo;bird 
flu&rdquo; that caused several human deaths in 2006. It is the virus&rsquo;s 
ability to rapidly mutate into a pathogen that may eventually be passed between 
humans that concerns health officials about a worldwide pandemic of H5N1 
influenza. The study also produced some evidence that strengthens the case that 
humans have had an impact on the movement of the flu out of Asia. &ldquo;This 
is the first time anyone&rsquo;s looked at all of the H5N1 genomes in the 
west,&rdquo; said Steven Salzberg, the study&rsquo;s lead author and director 
of the University of Maryland Center for Bioinformatics and Computational 
Biology. &ldquo;Until now, the studies have been primarily on samples from the 
Far East. Our study shows that the virus is spreading west, and that there have 
been three separate introductions of H5N1 in Europe, the Middle East and 
Africa.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 The study shows that the new Euro-African lineage, which was the 
cause of fatal human infections in Egypt and Iraq in 2006, has been introduced 
at least three times into the EMA region and has split into three distinct, 
independently evolving lineages. Two of those sublineages have recently 
reassorted. The broad dispersal of the different forms of the virus throughout 
the different countries over a relatively short period of time points to the 
possibility of human movement, rather than wild birds as the reason for the 
quick spread of the H5N1. &ldquo;The migratory pathways of wild birds 
don&rsquo;t correspond with the movement of the genomes that we 
sequenced,&rdquo; said Salzberg. &ldquo;Humans carry chickens between many of 
the countries in our study, often transporting them across great distances. 
That and the weak biosecurity standards in most rural areas point to 
human-related movement of live poultry as the source of the introduction of 
H5N1 in some countries.&rdquo; While the study &ldquo;dramatically increased 
the number of genomes that have been sequenced, we have to do more 
surveys,&rdquo; Salzberg said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising that we found what 
we did with such a small sample.&rdquo; To read the paper seeTHIS LINK.</p>

<b>Baby boomers appear to be less healthy than parents</b></p> 
<p> As the first wave of baby boomers edges toward retirement, a growing body 
of evidence suggests that they may be the first generation to enter their 
golden years in worse health than their parents. While not definitive, the data 
sketch a startlingly different picture than the popular image of 
health-obsessed workout fanatics who know their antioxidants from their trans 
fats and look 10 years younger than their age. Boomers are healthier in some 
important ways, they are much less likely to smoke, for example, but large 
surveys are consistently finding that they tend to describe themselves as less 
hale and hearty than their forebears did at the same age. They are more likely 
to report difficulty climbing stairs, getting up from a chair and doing other 
routine activities, as well as more chronic problems such as high cholesterol, 
blood pressure and diabetes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing some very powerful 
evidence all pointing to parallel findings,&rdquo; said Mark D. Hayward, a 
sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin. &ldquo;The trend seems to be 
that people are not as healthy as they approach retirement as they were in 
older generations. It&rsquo;s very disturbing.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> While cautioning that the data are just starting to emerge, researchers 
say the findings track with several unhealthy trends, notably the obesity 
epidemic. Two-thirds of Americans are overweight, and those extra pounds make 
joints wear out more quickly, boost cholesterol and blood pressure, and raise 
the risk of a host of debilitating health problems. And despite all those gym 
memberships, baby boomers tend to be less physically active than their parents 
and grandparents, their daily routines often dominated by desk jobs and the 
drive to and from work. Boomers tend to report more stress than earlier 
generations, from their jobs, their commutes, taking care of their parents and 
their kids, all of which can take a physical toll, which is compounded by 
having less support from extended families and communities, experts say. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p> When researchers examined the first wave of baby boomers (5,030 adults 
born between 1948 and 1953)to enter a federally funded Health and Retirement 
Study which is tracking more than 20,000 U.S. adults as they move through 
middle age toward retirement, they were shocked to discover that they appeared 
to report poorer health than groups born between 1936 and 1941, and between 
1942 and 1947. The baby boomers were much less likely than their predecessors 
to describe their health as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; 
and were more likely to report having difficulty with routine activities, such 
as walking several blocks or lifting 10 pounds. They were also more likely to 
report pain, drinking and psychiatric problems, and chronic problems such as 
high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. It is unclear whether 
boomers are really sicker or are simply more health-conscious by dint of being 
better educated and having better access to information. They may also have 
higher expectations, making them more likely to notice and complain about aches 
and pains that earlier generations would have accepted as just part of getting 
older. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The findings are consistent with a number of studies, including one last 
year that found American adults have poorer health than their British 
counterparts, and a preliminary analysis of data collected between 1972 and 
2003 for the National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative 
survey of more than 100,000 Americans. If the findings are confirmed by further 
analysis, the trend could force policymakers to rethink a host of expectations 
and projections about the nation&rsquo;s overall medical bill and the future of 
Social Security and other retirement programs. (Washington Post)<b> <br>

<b>John Hopkins begins aggressive screening for 
&lsquo;superbugs&rsquo; in children </b></p> 
<p> Infection control and critical care experts at The Johns Hopkins Hospital 
have ordered testing for the two most common hospital superbugs for every child 
admitted to its pediatric intensive care unit. The more stringent admission 
screening methods for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) go well beyond standard hospital 
practices, where tests are only ordered after symptoms or early signs of 
infection appear.&nbsp;The new hospital practice was introduced March 1 after a 
study conducted at Hopkins last year showed that more frequent screening 
detected many more carriers of the germs before their presence led to infection 
or the germs spread to others. Admission screening is already standard at 
Hopkins for adults admitted to intensive care units. Health experts fear spread 
of these particular bacteria because they have developed resistance to the 
antibiotic drugs most commonly used to combat them. Though infections caused by 
these bacteria are rarely fatal, carriers of either bug are at greater risk for 
more dangerous infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Results from the study, presented April 16 at the annual meeting of the 
Society of Health Care Epidemiology of America (SHEA) in Baltimore, are 
believed among the first to make a case for better screening in efforts to slow 
spread of the germs in hospitalized children. The study compared the 
effectiveness of weekly screening to current practices for ordering tests and 
found the weekly model to be many times more effective than standard risk 
monitoring, in which the highly contagious bacteria are looked for after 
patients develop skin rash, fever or pain. Weekly swab testing and bacterial 
growth cultures were done on nearly 330 patients in the hospital&rsquo;s 
pediatric intensive care unit for four months. Results were compared to 
findings of cultures obtained from patients showing possible signs or symptoms 
of infection. All patients were under age 18. The weekly testing for MRSA, the 
most common superbug, detected more than half of young patients who were 
carrying the germ (54 percent, or one and a half times as many)&nbsp; than were 
detected through routine testing, which missed 35 percent of those with 
MRSA.&nbsp;Results for detecting VRE, a lesser known but still common superbug, 
were six times higher with weekly testing than with routine testing, which 
missed 82 percent of those with VRE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>  Like most bacteria, hospital superbugs are picked up through direct 
contact, by touching someone or a surface with it.&nbsp;&ldquo;The results were 
quite clear to us: Aggressive patient safety programs should consider testing 
on admission as standard practice,&rdquo; said study senior author and hospital 
epidemiologist Trish Perl, M.D.&nbsp; Perl and her team, however, will wait for 
evidence of improved patient safety before making any national recommendations 
to government agencies and other hospitals. Perl is past president of SHEA. 
&ldquo;We need to find patients who have these bacteria on them and who, as 
such, are not only at risk of personal infection, but also pose a serious 
threat of infection to other patients and hospital staff,&rdquo; she said. 
According to Perl, a professor of medicine and pathology at The Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine, patients found to be infected or to be a carrier 
before infection has set in are placed in isolation for the remainder of their 
stay.&nbsp;Wound care is done only in designated, confined treatment spaces or 
separate rooms, and hospital staff must take special precautions between 
treatments, such as cleaning equipment and furniture with strong disinfectants 
and wearing disposable gloves, masks and gowns.&nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  &ldquo;Children are more vulnerable to the problem of antibiotic 
resistance because their bodies are not fully developed to fight off illness 
and because fewer drugs are FDA approved for use in children,&rdquo; said Aaron 
Milstone, M.D., a pediatric infectious diseases research fellow at Hopkins who 
led the tudy.&nbsp;Vancomycin (Vancocin) is currently the only FDA-approved 
drug for MRSA in children, and only one drug, linezolid (Zyvox), is approved in 
pediatrics for VRE. Milstone says children admitted to Hopkins are increasingly 
identified as harboring MRSA or VRE, with recent reports from the intensive 
care unit showing four times as many children with MRSA and twice as many with 
VRE than five years ago.&nbsp;</h1>

<p><b> OSHA, NIOSH publish bulletin to help protect surgical personnel from 
needle stick injuries<br>
</b> <br>
The U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention have jointly published a Safety and Health Information 
Bulletin (SHIB) designed to help protect surgical personnel from needle stick 
injuries while using suture needles. &ldquo;Surgical personnel are at risk of 
occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens from injuries caused by sharp 
surgical instruments,&rdquo; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Edwin 
G. Foulke, Jr. &ldquo;We strongly encourage the use of blunt-tip suture needles 
when feasible and appropriate to reduce this risk.&rdquo; &ldquo;The 
effectiveness of blunt-tip suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries 
has been widely reported,&rdquo; said NIOSH Director John Howard, M.D.<br>
<br>

 The SHIB, available on the OSHA Web site at  
http://www.osha.gov/dts/shib/shib032307.html and on the NIOSH Web site at  
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-132/, describes the hazards of sharp-tip 
suture needles and presents evidence of the effectiveness of blunt-tip needles 
in decreasing injuries. It also emphasizes OSHA&rsquo;s requirement to use 
appropriate, available and effective safer medical devices. Sharp-tip suture 
needles are the leading source of penetrating injuries to surgical personnel, 
causing 51-to-71 percent of these incidents. These injuries potentially expose 
staff and patients to bloodborne pathogens. The American College of Surgeons 
(ACS) issued a statement in 2005 supporting the use of blunt-tip suture needles 
where clinically appropriate. This statement has been endorsed by the six 
organizations that, along with the ACS, make up the Council on Surgical and 
Perioperative Safety. <br>

<h1> VHA Rapid Response Team network saves lives in Central Atlantic Region<br>
<br>  In May 2005, VHA Inc., a national health care alliance, launched a 
national effort to help its members implement Rapid Response Teams, hospital 
teams that can be called upon to help when it looks like patients in 
medical-surgical units are slowly spiraling toward a crisis such as cardiac 
arrest or shock, with the purpose of preventing that event. Thirty-one 
hospitals from Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, 
West Virginia and Washington D.C., joined the VHA initiative through its 
Central Atlantic office.&nbsp;By learning as a network through VHA and 
participating in VHA-sponsored educational meetings, using standard data 
collection tools and sharing their results,&nbsp;68 percent of the hospitals 
decreased their mortality rates and experienced 256 fewer code blue episodes 
(incidents when the patient stops breathing) outside of the intensive care unit 
(ICU). &ldquo;Rapid response teams help nurses provide better patient care, 
reduce costs and improve hospital culture,&rdquo; said Crystal Mullis, RN, BSN, 
MBA, MHA, director of performance improvement at VHA. &ldquo;More than half of 
the organizations that participated in the VHA rapid response team network in 
the region saw improvements in mortalities, percent of codes outside of the ICU 
and percent of patients that coded and survived.&rdquo;</h1> 
<h1>  &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  Moses Cone Health System in Greensboro, NC, was so impressed with the 
results of their program that the system hired a dedicated team that is not 
assigned from ICU staff. Convincing administration about hiring the team was 
relatively easy as both the finance committee and chief financial officer 
understood the value of the rapid response team concept. Rapid response team 
composition varies by hospital, but all teams contain a nurse trained in 
critical care. Teams can include a variety of other hospital staff members, 
physicians, residents, respiratory therapists and pharmacists. When patients 
show signs of clinical deterioration, distress or changes in vital signs, the 
team is called within minutes to the bedside for rapid assessment and 
treatment.&nbsp;Their response is crucial because patient survival rates are 
directly impacted by how quickly the patient is assessed and treated; swift 
clinical intervention decreases patient mortality rates significantly.&nbsp;The 
rapid response team is especially helpful when new staff needs help, hospital 
resources are limited or physicians are unavailable.&nbsp;VHA members 
participating in the rapid response team network have seen dramatic results 
from their adoption of the concept.<br>
 &nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>  Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, VA, calls its team the 
Medical-Surgical Emergency Team (MSET). Prior to launch, they experienced up to 
25 codes a month. Within the first three months, their code calls dropped by 10 
to13 calls.&nbsp;NorthEast Medical Center in Concord, N.C., launched its 
program, called the Stabilization Teaching Administration and Transport (STAT) 
team, in March 2004. The program&rsquo;s success spurred the launch of a 
secondary group called the Code Care team in June 2006. By dialing a special 
number, patients and family members can activate the Code Care team to evaluate 
a patient's condition. The STAT team is called if the patient&rsquo;s condition 
is serious or potentially life-threatening, and it has helped the hospital 
achieve a 65 percent decrease in cardiac arrests outside of the critical care 
unit and emergency department. Parkwest Medical Center in Knoxville, TN, 
launched its program in January 2006. In one year, the hospital achieved a 40 
percent reduction for in-patient non-critical care codes. In addition, the 
hospital has reduced the number of days that patients spend in the critical 
care unit and estimates it has avoided $520,000 in costs. For more information

Premier, Cardinal Health team up to help hospitals identify safer 
products<br>
 through use of standardized terminology</h1> 
<p><strong> <br>
</strong> Hospitals will have an easier time selecting safer 
products through an &ldquo;industry first&rdquo; effort by the Premier 
healthcare alliance and Cardinal Health to standardize medical product 
terminology in online catalogs. Historically, industry information describing 
the contents of a specific medical product has been inconsistent or 
non-existent, posing possible safety concerns. Through Premier&rsquo;s Supply 
Chain Advisor electronic product catalog and Cardinal Health SupplyLine, a 
large product comparison and purchasing database, Premier members will have a 
standard set of nomenclature for product attributes to make it easier to search 
for products that won&rsquo;t cause allergic reactions or those that are 
potentially toxic. For example, products that are made without latex, mercury, 
PVC and DEHP will have the new standardized nomenclature to include attributes 
such as: LATEX-FREE for products without latex; DEHP-FREE for products without 
the plasticizer, DEHP (Di(2&ndash;ethylhexyl) phthalate); MERCURY-FREE for 
products without mercury; and PVC-FREE for products without polyvinyl chloride.
</p> 
<p> <br>
 Unlike pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical products do not have a 
standard coding system, and functionally equivalent healthcare products are 
often difficult and time consuming to identify for cost saving opportunities. 
SupplyLine is a core component in Cardinal Health&rsquo;s rapidly growing 
Supply Technologies business that enables healthcare providers and companies to 
evaluate more than 800,000 healthcare products and research alternatives from 
thousands of manufacturers. In addition to cost savings, the benefits of 
SupplyLine include reduced waste and excess, improved inventory controls, 
improved utilization management and outcome analysis.</p> 
<p> The Premier Safety Institute Web site has extensive resources on latex 
allergies and environmentally preferable purchasing at www.premierinc.com/safety
. Premier Data Management Services has already processed several million new 
and updated product descriptions received in the past few months from 
SupplyLine. As the Supply Chain Advisor (SCA) database becomes populated by 
these new attributes, SCA users will be trained so they can begin to use the 
new search capabilities.</p>

<p> <b> Misusing vitamin to foil drug test may be toxic</b></p> 
<p> Taking excessive doses of a common vitamin in an attempt to defeat drug 
screening tests may send the user to the hospital, or worse. Researchers from 
The Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia and The University of 
Pennsylvania reported on two adults and two adolescents who suffered toxic side 
effects from taking large amounts of niacin, also known as vitamin B3, in 
mistaken attempts to foil urine drug tests. Both adult patients suffered skin 
irritation, while both adolescents had potentially life-threatening reactions, 
including liver toxicity and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), as well as nausea, 
vomiting and dizziness. One of the teens also had disrupted heart rhythms. All 
four patients recovered after treatment in hospital emergency rooms for the 
adverse effects. The report appeared online in the<i>Annals of Emergency 
Medicine</i>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Because niacin is known to affect metabolic processes, there is a 
completely unfounded claim that it can rapidly clear the body of drugs such as 
cannabis and cocaine. However, niacin is toxic when taken in large 
amounts.&rdquo; said study leader Manoj K. Mittal, M.D., a fellow in Emergency 
Medicine at The Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Niacin is easily 
available as an over-the-counter vitamin supplement. As a vitamin, the daily 
recommended intake is 15 milligrams, but niacin is used in much larger doses to 
treat vitamin deficiencies and other conditions. &ldquo;People often assume 
niacin is completely safe,&rdquo; said Dr. Mittal. &ldquo;As a water-soluble 
vitamin, it is easily excreted from the body. However, the body has its limits, 
and some of these patients took 300 times the daily recommended dose of 
niacin.&rdquo; Dr. Mittal added that there is a report in the medical 
literature of a patient who suffered liver failure, requiring a liver 
transplant, after taking excessive doses of niacin. &ldquo;We hope that our 
study will alert emergency medicine physicians and other healthcare providers 
to this hazardous practice,&rdquo; said Dr. Mittal.</p>

<h1> Decrease in breast cancer incidence linked to drop in hormone replacement
</h1> 
<p> <br>
 A special report in the April 19, 2007 edition of <i>The New England 
Journal of Medicine</i> concludes that the sharp decline in breast-cancer 
incidence in 2003, followed by a relative stabilization at a lower rater in 
2004, is most likely related to the first report of the Women&rsquo;s Health 
Initiative (WHI) (JAMA 2002; 288:321-333. Risks and benefits of estrogen plus 
progestin in healthy postmenopausal women&hellip;) and the ensuing drop in 
hormone-replacement therapy among postmenopausal women. The report shows that 
the age adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer in women in the United States 
fell sharply by 6.7% in 2003, as compared with the rate in 2002. Data from 2004 
showed a leveling-off relative to the 2003 rate with little additional 
decrease. The decrease was evident only in women who were 50 years of age or 
older and was more evident in cancers that were estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive 
than in those that were ER-negative. The reports&rsquo; lead author is Peter 
Ravdin, M.D., of the Anderson Cancer Center, and included investigators from 
the National Cancer Institute and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute 
at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (LA BioMed). Rowan Chlebowski, MD, PhD, a 
principal investigator/oncologist at LA BioMed, and the only researcher to 
participate in the 2002 reports of the trial evaluating estrogen plus progestin 
(which led to the decrease in menopausal hormone therapy use in 2003) and the 
2006-07 studies outlining the subsequent decrease in breast cancer, states: 
&ldquo;While the cause of the reduction is not definitive, the sustained 
decrease in new breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. is a remarkable event. We 
estimate 44,000 fewer breast cancers over those two years (2003-04) and 
thousands more in the coming decades.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 Researchers looked at several variables that could be responsible 
for such a decline. They looked for flaws in the data itself, changes in 
reproductive factors, changes in mammographic screening, changes in 
environmental exposures, changes in diet, and changes in use of 
hormone-replacement therapy. Only the use of hormone-replacement therapy 
changed substantially, with the total number of prescriptions for the two most 
commonly prescribed forms of hormone-replacement therapy in the U.S., Premarin 
and Prempro, having their steepest declines starting in 2002 and particularly 
in 2003 (62 million scripts in 2000, 61 million in 2001, 47 million in 2002, 24 
million in 2003, 21 million in 2004, and 18 million in 2005). The reduction of 
hormone-replacement therapy could have caused a decreased incidence of breast 
cancer by direct hormonal effects on the growth of occult breast cancers, a 
change that would have affected predominantly ER-positive tumors. The rapidity 
of the change suggests that clinically occult breast cancers stopped 
progressing or even regressed soon after the discontinuation of the therapy. 
The hypotheses is that hormone withdrawal can rapidly influence the growth of 
breast cancer is supported by anecdotal reports of regression of breast cancer 
after discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy. </p>

1,000 extra ovarian cancer deaths due to HRT in UK since 1991</h1> 
<h1> <br>
 A suspected 1,000 extra women in the UK have died from ovarian 
cancer between 1991 and 2005 because they were using Hormone Replacement 
Therapy (HRT), according to an article published online and in an upcoming 
edition of<i>The Lancet</i>. There were also around 1,300 extra cases of 
ovarian cancer diagnosed in the same period. The figures are reported in the 
&ldquo;Million Women Study&rdquo; by Professor Valerie Beral and colleagues, of 
the Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, Oxford, UK. Ovarian cancer is the 
fourth most common cancer in UK women, with about 6,700 developing the 
condition and 4,600 dying from it every year. The researchers assessed data 
from 948,576 postmenopausal women who did not have previous cancer or bilateral 
oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) for five years. Around 30% were current 
HRT users and 20% had previously received HRT. 2,273 women developed ovarian 
cancer and 1,591 died from it. They found that current HRT users were on 
average 20% more likely to develop and die from ovarian cancer than those who 
had never received HRT. For every 1,000 women using HRT, 2.6 developed ovarian 
cancer over five years, compared to 2.2 per 1,000 in women who did not use HRT, 
one extra ovarian cancer diagnosed in every 2,500 HRT users, and one extra 
death from ovarian cancer in every 3,300 users. But risk did not differ 
significantly by type of HRT preparation used, its constituents, or mode of 
administration. </h1> 
<p> The women&rsquo;s socioeconomic status, reproductive history, previous use 
of oral contraceptives, body-mass index, alcohol and tobacco consumption did 
not appreciably alter the effect of HRT on their risk of developing ovarian 
cancer. The researchers also reported that after women stop taking HRT, their 
risk of ovarian cancer returns to that found in never-users of HRT. In total, 
ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer account for around 40% of all cancers 
diagnosed in UK women. The authors conclude: &ldquo;The effect of HRT on 
ovarian cancer should not be viewed in isolation, especially since use of HRT 
also affects the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.&rdquo; They add: 
&ldquo;The total incidence of these three cancers in the study population is 
63% higher in current users of HRT than never users. Thus when ovarian, 
endometrial and breast cancer are taken together, use of HRT results in a 
material increase in these common cancers.&rdquo; In an accompanying comment, 
Dr. Steven Narod, of the Women&rsquo;s College Research Institute, University 
of Toronto, Canada, said: &ldquo;Use of hormone replacement has declined 
dramatically in the UK and elsewhere since the report of the Women&rsquo;s 
Health Initiative, and is thought to be responsible for a recent reduction in 
breast cancer rates recorded in the US. &ldquo;With these new data on ovarian 
cancer, we expect the use of HRT to fall further. We hope that the number of 
women dying of ovarian cancer will decline as well.&rdquo; <br>

<p><b> Republicans block Medicare drug price bill</b></p> 
<p> Senate Republicans blocked legislation yesterday that would have allowed 
the federal government to negotiate Medicare drug prices, denying Democrats a 
victory on their 2006 election vow to lower prescription costs for senior 
citizens. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have plenty of additional chances,&rdquo; said Sen.
Ron Wyden (D-OR), a supporter of the bill. &ldquo;This is not the end of the 
debate.&rdquo; Democrats needed a 60-vote majority to start debate on the 
measure, but lost 55 to 42. Democratic leaders had low expectations for 
victory. For one, they faced formidable opposition from the pharmaceutical and 
health insurance industries, two of the most powerful lobbying forces on 
Capitol Hill. But the benefit also has gained wide popularity, costing 
consumers and the government far less than initially projected. Republicans in 
particular who had been skeptical about the benefit now acknowledge its success 
and are reluctant to tamper with it. Currently, more than 22 million seniors 
and disabled people receive drug coverage under Medicare. The Senate 
legislation would have allowed the government to directly negotiate with drug 
companies to secure lower prices for medications. But an independent 
Congressional Budget Office analysis found that the proposal would not result 
in cheaper drugs unless Congress modified the program, possibly restricting 
access and choice for beneficiaries. (Washington Post) </p>

<p><b> WSJ: Pediatric ICUs make headway against infection<br>
</b> <br>
 For 
the sickest infants and children, pediatric intensive-care units provide the 
highest level of medical care, treating children after complicated surgeries, 
severe illness or accidents. But the very catheters, intravenous lines and 
invasive medical procedures used to keep children alive are also putting them 
at higher risk of bacterial infection. Now, with mounting alarm about the high 
rate of hospital-acquired infections, critical-care specialists are taking new 
steps to protect the smallest and most vulnerable patients, challenging the 
prevailing wisdom that infections are simply inevitable in a busy and stressful 
intensive-care environment. The nonprofit National Association of 
Children&rsquo;s Hospitals and Related Institutions, with 208 member hospitals 
in the U.S. and overseas, is leading an ambitious effort to eradicate 
bloodstream infections, the most severe infectious threat in pediatric ICUs. In 
the first six months of the three-year project, 29 participating hospital units 
have slashed infection rates by close to 70% by adhering to a rigid set of 
measures shown to prevent infection in children, including far more rigorous 
care of catheters, higher sterile precautions, and constant assessment of the 
need for keeping catheters in place. Pediatric intensive-care units also are 
adopting new programs to sharply reduce or eliminate urinary-tract infections 
for children with bladder catheters, and pneumonia for children on ventilators, 
the two most prevalent complications after bloodstream infections. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> While infections have always been a risk for hospital patients of every 
age, experts say that children may be at even higher risk than adults. Until 
now, though, prevention efforts have focused largely on adults, and measures 
that are known to prevent infection in children aren&rsquo;t always 
consistently used, experts say. Over the past few years, hospital bugs have 
become increasingly resistant to common antibiotics, striking two million 
patients and claiming 100,000 lives annually. There are no precise statistics 
on how many of those deaths are infants and children. But a review of published 
literature last month in the journal<i>Pediatric Critical Care</i> by Jana 
Stockwell, a pediatric critical-care physician at hospital operator 
Children&rsquo;s Healthcare of Atlanta, concluded that infections can strike as 
many as 16% of children in pediatric units, a higher rate than in many adult 
ICUs, and increase the risk of death by up to 20%. Studies also show that 
treating an infection can add nearly $40,000 in additional hospital costs. 
&ldquo;These kids are at incredible risk for infection, with thin skins that 
provide a poor barrier to infection and immature or severely compromised immune 
systems,&rdquo; said Paul Sharek, chief clinical patient-safety officer for 
Lucille Packard Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Stanford University, which has 
made reducing catheter-related infections its No. 1 goal for the past two 
years. Even though the steps for preventing infections are fairly routine, he 
adds, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easier said than done, and involves massive cultural 
shifts&rdquo; for medical staff who are used to handling medical procedures 
their own way.</p> 
<p> Catheters are a big focus of such efforts because they require an invasive 
procedure that could allow bacteria to enter the body. Nachri&rsquo;s 
bloodstream-infection prevention effort is relying on so-called 
&ldquo;bundles&rdquo; of catheter insertion and maintenance protocols that have 
already been shown to save lives and costs. Children&rsquo;s Healthcare Corp. 
of America, a supply-purchasing cooperative of 42 children&rsquo;s hospitals, 
pilot-tested the bundles in 2005. The goal was to cut bloodstream infections by 
50%, to 1.5 infections per 1,000 catheter days. About two-thirds of the 28 
participating hospitals were able to reduce infections by an average of 57%, 
which Barbara Spreadbury, a vice president at CHCA, estimates saved 112 
children&rsquo;s lives, and nearly $1 million in potential treatment costs. The 
aim now is to test a more comprehensive set of measures over a longer period 
and get them adopted as standard procedure, according to Mary Gorman, a vice 
president overseeing the project at Nachri. (Source: The Wall Street Journal)

<h1> US critical care delivery system in critical condition</h1> 
<p> <br>
 The demand for critical care services in the United States will soon 
outpace the supply of specialists trained in intensive care, a situation that, 
if not remedied, may prove fatal for critically ill patients. The solution to 
this problem lies not in recruiting and training more personnel, but in 
reorganizing the critical care system nationwide, according to a report from a 
group of critical care stakeholders, led by University of Pittsburgh School of 
Medicine researchers and published in the April issue of the journal<i>Critical 
Care Medicine</i>. &ldquo;The number of Americans over the age of 65 is 
expected to double by 2030. In addition to non-elective medical admissions for 
critical illness among chronically ill elders, the growth rate in elective 
surgical procedures requiring intensive care unit admission, such as bypass 
surgery, is growing fastest among this age group,&rdquo; said Amber E. Barnato, 
M.D., M.P.H., M.Sc., assistant professor, department of medicine, University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine. &ldquo;All of this means more and more people 
will demand already strained intensive care services. This anticipated mismatch 
between supply and demand is perhaps no different for critical care services 
than for other medical care disproportionately serving elders, ranging from 
emergency services to long-term care services, but the opportunities for 
improving the efficiency of the existing system to meet demand are probably 
greater.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 The report, developed following a meeting of critical care 
stakeholders called the Prioritizing the Organization and Management of 
Intensive care Services (PrOMIS) Conference held in September 2005, calls for 
creation of a tiered, regionalized system for critical care services in an 
effort to centralize expertise, equipment and facilities. This would make the 
necessary critical care services readily available to the patients who are most 
in need. &ldquo;Prior conferences aimed at addressing this problem sought input 
only from critical care professionals, who are a fraction of all the 
stakeholders,&rdquo; said Dr. Barnato, lead author of the report. &ldquo;These 
groups often stated the need for more trained providers. Surveying a wider 
group of interested parties, we found that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily the 
best or only solution.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 For the PrOMIS Conference, organizers attempted to identify problems 
in the current U.S. critical care system as seen by all stakeholders, including 
those from professional organizations, critical care and non-critical care 
physicians, federal and private health insurers, federal and private funding 
organizations, and the general public. In the paper, researchers say the 
primary concern voiced by participants was that the &ldquo;utilization, 
organization and management of intensive care services in the United States was 
not optimal.&rdquo; They broadly agreed that there was a need to regionalize 
and tier the critical care system, similar to what previously had been done by 
the U.S. trauma system. Such a system would require the most critically ill 
patients to be seen in top-level critical care centers. Lower-level centers 
would not provide ongoing critical care services, but would need to transfer 
critically ill patients to higher-level centers. Participants also cited the 
need to acknowledge that some critical care services should be provided by 
physicians, such as hospitalists and emergency physicians, who currently are 
not certified by the existing critical care boards. Conference organizers hope 
that critical care societies will support a second stakeholder meeting, PrOMIS 
II, charged with developing concrete accreditation criteria for the proposed 
regionalized tiered system, defining explicit triage and quality surveillance 
criteria for each tier, developing a comprehensive set of core competencies for 
critical care providers and endorsing a method to train and certify critical 
care providers in these competencies. </p>

<p><b> Women weighed down by health care costs, new study finds</b></p> 
<p> As Cover the Uninsured Week approaches, a new Commonwealth Fund report by 
researchers at the National Women&rsquo;s Law Center finds that even women with 
health insurance coverage are more likely than insured men to go without needed 
healthcare because of costs. Also, a higher percentage of women than men 
struggle with medical bills. The report, &ldquo;Women and Health Coverage: The 
Affordability Gap,&rdquo; by Elizabeth M. Patchias and Judith G. Waxman of the 
National Women&rsquo;s Law Center finds that women are at a disadvantage 
because they have greater healthcare needs and lower incomes than men. More 
specifically, the report finds that 38% of women are struggling with medical 
bills compared with 29% of men. And, the high cost of healthcare services and 
premiums is forcing many women, even women with health insurance, to go without 
needed care. In fact, 33% of insured women and 68% of uninsured women 
don&rsquo;t get the healthcare they need because they can&rsquo;t afford it. In 
contrast, 23% of insured and 49% of uninsured men are avoiding care because of 
cost. Further, 16% of women are underinsured, meaning they have high 
out-of-pocket costs compared to their income, while only 9% of men are 
underinsured.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Women are more likely than men to go without 
needed healthcare services because of costs, yet they still have higher 
out-of-pocket expenses. This disparity exists for both insured and uninsured 
women,&rdquo; said Waxman, vice president for Health and Reproductive Rights at 
the National Women&rsquo;s Law Center. &ldquo;As policymakers and advocates 
explore how to expand and improve health coverage, they should ensure that any 
proposal provides comprehensive benefits and low cost-sharing.&rdquo; Other 
factors contribute to this gender gap in healthcare coverage and access: women 
are slightly more likely than men to purchase coverage in the individual 
insurance market which is often more expensive and less comprehensive than 
employer coverage. Women are also more likely than men to take prescription 
drugs. &ldquo;These findings show that comprehensive healthcare coverage that 
doesn&rsquo;t require high out-of-pocket costs is vital to ensuring that women 
get the care they need to be healthy,&rdquo; said Sara Collins, assistant vice 
president for the Program on the Future of Health Insurance at The Commonwealth 
Fund.<br>

<p><b> Difficult births in obese women due to uterus failure</b></p> 
<p> In a study of 4,000 pregnant women, researchers found that almost 1 in 5 
overweight women had to undergo an emergency Caesarean Section birth because 
the muscles in their uterus failed. The research suggests obesity impairs the 
ability of the uterus to contract sufficiently in order to dilate the cervix 
and deliver the baby. The team from the University of Liverpool&rsquo;s 
Physiology department found that obese women were 3.5 times more likely to 
require a Caesarean for slow labor than normal weight women. Obese women who 
gave birth vaginally were also found to encounter other problems in child 
birth, more than twice as many (6%) experienced excessive bleeding following 
delivery compared with normal weight women (3%). This blood loss was also 
attributed to poor uterine activity in the obese group.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Professor Sue Wray, said, &ldquo;Our research shows overweight women 
are at considerably higher risk of having to undergo an emergency Caesarean 
Section birth and find labor a more difficult experience than normal weight 
women. Interestingly, when we took uterus muscle samples from the overweight 
women and studied them in the lab they also performed poorly and contracted 
less well than matched samples from normal weight women.&rdquo; The research 
team found that less calcium was able to enter the uterine cells of the obese 
women to support uterus muscles in contracting during labor. Professor Wray 
explained: &ldquo;We suspect one reason preventing sufficient levels of calcium 
entering the uterus muscles is the high levels of cholesterol in an obese 
woman&rsquo;s bloodstream. This could disrupt cell membranes and signaling 
pathways, including calcium entry. We will be investigating this further in 
future studies.&rdquo; Dr. Siobhan Quenby from the University of 
Liverpool&rsquo;s Obstetrics department commented: &ldquo;In the meantime it is 
vital pre-pregnancy advice and counseling is available to women about the 
implications of weight on childbirth. Pregnancies among overweight women must 
be classified as high risk pregnancies and appropriate antenatal care should be 
provided so they receive the optimum care during maternity.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b> FDA seizes all medical products from NJ device manufacturer<br>
 for 
significant manufacturing violations</b> </p> 
<p>  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators and U.S. Marshals 
today seized all implantable medical devices from Shelhigh Inc., Union, NJ, 
after finding significant deficiencies in the company&rsquo;s manufacturing 
processes. The deficiencies may compromise the safety and effectiveness of the 
products, particularly their sterility. The products include pediatric heart 
valves and conduits, surgical patches, dural patches, annuloplasty rings and 
arterial grafts. The tissue-based devices are used in many surgical settings, 
including open heart surgery in adults, children and infants, and to repair 
soft tissue during neurosurgery and abdominal, pelvic and thoracic surgery. 
Critically ill patients, pediatric patients and immuno-compromised patients may 
be at greatest risk from the use of these devices.<br>
<br>
 Shelhigh&rsquo;s 
violations include: manufacturing products in a facility with a poorly 
constructed and poorly maintained clean room where sterilized devices are 
further processed; failing to adequately monitor critical manufacturing 
environments for possible microbial contamination; failing to properly test 
products for sterility and fever-causing contaminants; and failing to 
scientifically support product expiration dates. Physicians should consider 
using alternative devices. Physicians should also monitor patients with a 
Shelhigh implant for infections and proper device functioning over the expected 
lifetime of the device. Patients who think they may have received a Shelhigh 
device during surgery should contact their physician for more information. FDA 
will issue a Preliminary Public Health Notification to physicians and other 
health care professionals and a Preliminary Advice for Patients shortly with 
more information; those documents will be posted to FDA&rsquo;s Web site. The 
seizure follows an FDA inspection of the Shelhigh manufacturing facility last 
fall, as well as meetings with the company at which FDA warned Shelhigh that 
failure to correct its violations could result in an enforcement action. FDA 
also alerted the company to its manufacturing deficiencies and other violations 
in two warning letters.</p> 
<p> Medical devices manufactured by Shelhigh include: Shelhigh Pericardial

<h2> FDA approves first U.S. vaccine for humans against the avian influenza 
virus H5N1</h2> 
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first approval in 
the United States of a vaccine for humans against the H5N1 influenza virus, 
commonly known as avian or bird flu. The vaccine could be used in the event the 
current H5N1 avian virus were to develop the capability to efficiently spread 
from human to human, resulting in the rapid spread of the disease across the 
globe. Should such an influenza pandemic emerge, the vaccine may provide early 
limited protection in the months before a vaccine tailored to the pandemic 
strain of the virus could be developed and produced.</p> 
<p>The vaccine was obtained from a human strain and is intended for immunizing 
people 18 through 64 years of age who could be at increased risk of exposure to 
the H5N1 influenza virus contained in the vaccine. H5N1 influenza vaccine 
immunization consists of two intramuscular injections, given approximately one 
month apart. The manufacturer, sanofi pasteur Inc., will not sell the vaccine 
commercially. Instead, the vaccine has been purchased by the federal government 
for inclusion within the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile for distribution by 
public health officials if needed. The vaccine will be manufactured at sanofi 
pasteur's Swiftwater, PA, facility.</p> 
<p>A clinical study was conducted to collect safety information and 
information on recipient&rsquo;s immune responses and to determine the 
appropriate vaccine dose. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with the 
most common side effects reported as pain at the injection site, headache, 
general ill feeling and muscle pain. The study showed that 45 percent of 
individuals who received a 90 microgram, two-dose regimen developed antibodies 
at a level that is expected to reduce the risk of getting influenza. Although 
the level of antibodies seen in the remaining individuals did not reach that 
level, current scientific information on other influenza vaccines suggests that 
less than optimal antibody levels may still have the potential to help reduce 
disease severity and influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths.</p> 
<p>With the support of FDA, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and other 
government agencies, sanofi pasteur and other manufacturers are working to 
develop a next generation of influenza vaccines for enhanced immune responses 
at lower doses, using technologies intended to boost the immune response. 
Meanwhile, the approval and availability of this vaccine will enhance national 
readiness and the nation&rsquo;s ability to protect those at increased risk of 
exposure. For more information see www.pandemicflu.gov.</p>

<p><b> UGA study suggests that lowering blood pressure following stroke<br>
 
may reduce damage</b></p> 
<p> A new University of Georgia study suggests that commonly prescribed drugs 
used to lower blood pressure may help reduce brain damage when given within 24 
hours of a stroke. The finding, based on a study using rats and published in 
the April issue of the<i>Journal of Hypertension</i>, may ultimately 
revolutionize emergency stroke care by putting blood pressure-lowering 
medications alongside clot-busting drugs and blood thinners as front-line 
medications. &ldquo;There is a long-standing controversy about whether you 
should even treat elevated blood pressure in stroke victims,&rdquo; said lead 
author Susan Fagan, professor of clinical and administrative pharmacy at the 
UGA College of Pharmacy and the Medical College of Georgia. &ldquo;We were able 
to show that lowering blood pressure in the 24 hours following a stroke can 
reduce brain damage.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Fagan and her team induced strokes in rats by occluding a major artery in 
the brain. After three hours, the suture was removed to simulate the effect of 
thrombolytic, or clot-busting, drugs. The rats were then given one of two 
common blood pressure lowering drugs or, for the control group, a saline 
solution. When the researchers measured the amount of brain damage, they found 
that the rats that had received the blood pressure lowering drugs fared 
significantly better. While the control group showed damage in 50 percent of 
the brain, those receiving the drugs hydralazine and enalapril showed 30 
percent damage.</p> 
<p> The finding complements a study Fagan and her colleagues published last 
year in the same journal that found similar reductions in brain damage using 
the common blood pressure drug, candesartan, a popular drug in the class known 
as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The rats given candesartan, however, 
showed the additional benefit of improved function while the rats receiving the 
other blood pressure medications had less benefit. Fagan said that in addition 
to protecting the brain and blood vessels through lowering blood pressure, ARBs 
appear to provide additional benefits by blocking the damaging effects of 
angiotensin II, a molecule released from the brain and probably other tissues 
following stroke.</p> 
<p> Many physicians believe that elevated blood pressure following a stroke is 
necessary to keep oxygenated blood at the site of the blockage. Now that there 
is convincing evidence that lowering blood pressure can be beneficial after 
stroke, Fagan is working on a protocol for a human clinical trial that would 
identify what patient characteristics predict a good response to blood pressure 
lowering. &ldquo;There are probably some patients that can benefit a great deal 
by having their blood pressure lowered within that first 24 hours after a 
stroke,&rdquo; Fagan said. &ldquo;Our challenge now is identifying those 
patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p> <b> New research shows that flu is a trigger of heart attacks</b></p> 
<p> Doctors need to take concerted action to ensure that people who are at 
risk of heart disease receive the influenza vaccine every autumn, according to 
the authors of a new report published in the<i>European Heart Journal</i>. 
Their research shows that influenza epidemics are associated with a rise in 
deaths from heart disease and that flu can actually trigger the heart attacks 
that result in death. However, only about 60% of people in the US who ought to 
have a flu shot actually have one and this percentage is even smaller in 
Europe, said Professor Mohammad Madjid, the lead author of the report. 
&ldquo;Our research has shown that influenza epidemics are associated with a 
rise in coronary deaths. This calls for more intensive efforts to increase the 
vaccination rate in people at risk of coronary heart disease. This may be 
especially important in an influenza pandemic when we would expect to see high 
mortality amongst the elderly and those suffering from heart problems or who 
have multiple coronary risk factors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Between 10 and 20% 
of people catch flu every year, and I have estimated that we can prevent up to 
90,000 coronary deaths a year in the US if every high risk patient received an 
annual flu vaccination.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Madjid, who is assistant professor of medicine at the University of 
Texas-Houston, and a senior research scientist at the Texas Heart Institute in 
Houston, worked with colleagues in the US and in St. Petersburg in the Russian 
Federation to investigate deaths between 1993 and 2000 in St. Petersburg that 
had been shown by autopsy reports to be due to coronary heart disease. 
&ldquo;This was a population where only a small minority were receiving flu 
vaccines or statin drugs, so this enabled us to see what happened naturally in 
the absence of these medicines,&rdquo; said Madjid. &ldquo;Relying on autopsy 
reports rather than death certificates enabled us to be much more accurate 
about the cause of death, because doctors often neglect to list flu on a death 
certificate if their patients have died from a heart attack and, conversely, 
heart attack symptoms can be missed in patients suffering from flu and 
pneumonia.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> They found that 11,892 people died from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
(47.8% men and 52.2% women), and 23,000 died from chronic ischaemic heart 
disease (IHD) (40.1% men and 59.9% women). The peaks in deaths from both AMI 
and IHD coincided with the times when influenza epidemics and acute respiratory 
disease (ARD), which often accompanies flu, were at their height. They found 
that the chances of dying from AMI increased by a third in epidemic weeks, 
compared to non-epidemic weeks, and the chances of dying from IHD increased by 
a tenth. This was the same for both men and women and in different age groups. 
Researchers believe that flu causes an acute and severe inflammation in the 
body, which, in some patients, can destabilize atherosclerotic plaques in 
coronary arteries and cause heart attacks.</p> 
<p> Madjid said: &ldquo;Most people develop atherosclerotic lesions in their 
coronary arteries in early childhood and these lesions grow over time. 
Inflammation plays a pivotal role in development and growth of these lesions. 
Most people in Western countries live with different stages of atherosclerosis 
and many will never show any clinical manifestations of the atherosclerosis. 
However, in some patients the quiescent, stable atherosclerotic plaques undergo 
sudden changes, mainly due to exaggerated inflammation, leading to rupture of 
these vulnerable plaques and subsequent formation of clots resulting in heart 
attacks. This study shows that flu is an important trigger of heart attacks 
because flu is a severe infection, with high incidence rates and is readily 
preventable.&rdquo; Madjid pointed out that the implications of the research 
were even more important with a looming flu pandemic when a much higher 
percentage of the population could be expected to catch the illness. </p>

<b>For-profit dialysis centres may be over-treating anemia</b> </p> 
<p>  In a new US study, scientists suggest that large for-profit kidney 
dialysis chains in the US give patients more anti-anemia drugs and aim for 
higher hemoglobin levels than nonprofit centres. Giving patients too much 
anti-anemia drugs can put their lives at risk. The study is published in the<i>
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</i>. Epoetin (marketed as 
Epogen and Procrit) is prescribed to kidney patients as part of their dialysis 
treatment, depending on how anemic they are and the level of hemoglobin their 
doctor is aiming to get them to. In the US as well as hospital-based dialysis 
facilities there are independently owned profit based facilities that claim 
back expenses for patient treatment, including anti-anemia epoetin, from 
Medicare. Epoetin therapy is the single largest Medicare drug expenditure for 
dialysis-related anemia, accounting for 1.8 billion dollars of expenditure in 
2004, said the study authors. The researchers used data from the US Renal Data 
System and found 159,522 adult Medicare-eligible, end-stage renal disease 
patients who were receiving hemodialysis at various centres during November and 
December 2004. They analyzed the data using statistical regression models to 
examine the mean epoetin dose and dose adjustment by profit, chain, and 
affiliation status of the centres that patients attended.</p> 
<p>  The researchers found that: Dosing of epoetin varied significantly 
depending on organizational status and ownership of the kidney dialysis centre. 
The 106,116 patients who attended large for-profit dialysis centres were 
consistently administered the highest doses of epoetin compared with 28,199 
patients who attended nonprofit centres, regardless of how anemic they were. A 
typical hospital-based centre administered an average dose of 16,188 units per 
week of epoetin, while for-profit chain centres administered an average dose of 
20,838 units a week. On average, for-profit centres gave patients an average 
dose of 3,306 units a week more than non-profit dialysis centres. The greatest 
difference in dosing practice patterns between centres was found among patients 
with hematocrit levels of less than 33 percent. On average, compared with 
nonprofit centres, for-profit centres increased epoetin doses 3-fold for 
patients with hematocrit levels of less than 33 percent. Among the 6 large 
chain facilities with a similar patient case-mix, the average dose of epoetin 
ranged from 17,832 units per week at chain 5 (nonprofit facilities with a mean 
hematocrit level of 34.6 percent) to 24,986 units per week at chain 2 
(for-profit facilities with a mean hematocrit level of 36.5 percent).<br>
<br>
 
The researchers concluded that: &ldquo;Dialysis facility organizational status 
and ownership are associated with variation in epoetin dosing in the United 
States. Different epoetin dosing patterns suggest that large for-profit chain 
facilities used larger dose adjustments and targeted higher hematocrit 
levels.&rdquo; The authors expressed concern that overprescription of epoetin 
was taking place in the for-profit centres. In an accompanying editorial (Use 
of Epoetin in Chronic Renal Failure), Dr Daniel Coyne, professor of medicine at 
Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis, said that the 
authorities disagree on what the optimal level of hemoglobin in the blood 
should be. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommend 
the maximum level of blood hemoglobin should be under 12 grams per decilitre 
(12 g/dl). But, this compares with 13 g/dl, the maximum level recommended by 
the National Kidney Foundation, which Dr. Coyne says is about to revise its 
guidelines. In his view, because of recent clinical trials, Dr. Coyne thinks 
the 12 g/dl limit is safer.<br>
<br>
 Experts reacting to this study suggest 
that changing the way for-profit dialysis centres are reimbursed by Medicare 
(currently they are paid for doing dialysis and giving the anemia drugs 
separately) to a composite system would be a better way to do it and would 
remove the incentive that is tied to the drug on its own. Administrators of 
for-profit dialysis centres say that the decision on which dose and guideline 
to follow is under the control of the patient&rsquo;s doctor. The FDA has 
recently issued warnings for epoetin and another similar drug darbepoetin which 
is used to treat cancer patients with anemia. Too much hemoglobin is dangerous 
because it increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes and blood clots.

<p><b> HHS issues report to Congress on e-prescribing </b></p> 
<p> In a report to Congress, HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt announced the 
results of an electronic prescribing pilot project that support the adoption of 
new electronic prescribing standards.&nbsp;These standards, required by the 
Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, would help cut both medication errors and 
health care costs. &ldquo;Electronic prescribing improves efficiencies while 
helping to eliminate potentially harmful drug interactions and other medication 
problems,&rdquo; Secretary Leavitt said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It also solves the problem 
of hard-to-read handwritten prescriptions.&nbsp;Additionally, such health 
information technologies promote affordability by allowing physicians to know 
which medications are covered by their patients&rsquo; Part D plans.&rdquo; </p>
<p> The pilot project demonstrated that three initial standards are already 
capable of supporting e-prescribing transactions in Medicare Part D.&nbsp;These 
are standard transactions that provide physicians with patients&rsquo; 
formulary and benefit information, medication history, and the fill status of 
their medications. The report also found that, with some adjustments, 
e-prescribing can work successfully in long-term care settings. Some of the 
initial e-prescribing standards tested by the pilot project were found to have 
potential but still need further development if they are to be adopted as 
e-prescribing standards. These include standards used to convey structured 
patient instructions, a terminology to describe clinical drugs, and messages 
that convey prior authorization information. Five pilot sites operating in 
eight states tested initial standards to determine if they were ready for 
widespread adoption.&nbsp;Those pilot sites were Achieve Healthcare Information

<p> <b> Rampage strains area hospitals</b> </p> 
<p>  BLACKSBURG, VA, April 17 -- Four hospitals in this rural area of 
southwestern Virginia were swamped Monday after the Virginia Tech shooting 
rampage sent more than two dozen victims to emergency rooms, with the first 
arriving here at a regional medical center about 7:30 a.m. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t 
know if you can ever be prepared for this type of violence,&rdquo; Scott Hill, 
chief executive officer of Montgomery Regional Hospital, said Monday night. 
Hill said that extra nurses and an additional surgeon were called in to help 
treat more than a dozen patients sent to the 146-bed hospital. &ldquo;We 
certainly had a lot of patients and extra help to deal with the 
situation,&rdquo; Hill said. &ldquo;We were in constant communication with 
police, so we knew what was coming.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Hospital officials kept 
friends and family members sequestered away from the news media. William Brady, 
an emergency medicine professor at the University of Virginia, said that the 
total number of gunshot wounds would swamp any hospital, especially those in 
rural areas with limited resources. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a single hospital or 
two hospitals, it could certainly paralyze the hospital,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;It can really slow a hospital down.&rdquo; He said gunshot wounds pose 
special challenges. (Washington Post)</p>

<b>FDA announces recommendations to reauthorize medical device user 
fee program</b></p> 
<p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed recommendations to 
Congress for reauthorizing the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act 
(MDUFMA II), which, if adopted, would help to ensure that safe and effective 
medical devices get to patients in a timely manner. FDA is accepting public 
comments on the proposal for the next 30 days and is holding a public meeting 
on April 30. Under the medical device user fee program, industry covers a 
portion of the costs of FDA&rsquo;s pre-market review program through a variety 
of fees. The fees are used in concert with the agency&rsquo;s annual 
appropriations to help FDA meet its review performance goals, which would speed 
more promising products to market than before. The industry user fees represent 
less than a quarter of the overall device budget for MDUFMA II. MDUFMA II would 
provide industry with predictable and more stable fees because the amount for 
each type of fee for each year of the program would be prescribed in the 
statute. Manufacturers would continue to pay fees when they submit applications 
for some types of medical device applications, but at a lower rate than under 
the current program. The proposal would also provide for additional fees. A fee 
would be assessed on facilities that register with FDA as a medical device 
manufacturer. In addition, annual report filing fees would be collected for 
pre-market approvals.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Small businesses, a significant portion of device manufacturers, 
would see additional benefits under the proposal. The fees currently paid by 
businesses with $100 million or less in annual sales or receipts would be 
reduced from 80 percent of the full fee in the first device user fee program to 
50 percent for 510(k) applications, and from 38 percent to 25 percent for 
pre-market approvals and related supplement fees. FDA would continue to waive 
the fee for all first-time pre-market approval applications for businesses with 
$30 million or less in annual sales or receipts. In addition, the proposal 
would allow a mechanism for foreign businesses to qualify as small businesses.
</p> 
<p> <br>
 To achieve greater transparency, FDA would continue to foster 
interactive review by encouraging informal communication with companies; 
facilitate the timely scheduling of informal and formal meetings; expand the 
kinds of performance information FDA makes available to the public; enhance 
opportunities for stakeholders to provide input into guidance document 
development; facilitate the development of guidance to streamline the processes 
and to clarify the data requirements for the approval or clearance of imaging 
devices that use contrast agents or radiopharmaceuticals. The proposal would 
streamline the third party inspection program, which allows for the use of 
accredited private sector auditors for routine inspections, by making it easier 
for manufacturers to participate in the program. MDUFMA II would foster the 
development of innovative in vitro diagnostic tests by issuing new industry 
guidance on important emerging issues and reviewing some low-risk devices to 
determine whether any of them could be exempted from the need for product 
review. In addition, FDA would conduct a pilot program under which the agency 
would review simultaneously a company's 510(k) and waiver applications under 
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, the law that governs quality 
standards for all laboratory testing.</p>

Geisinger launches extensive study on obesity and related liver 
problem</b> <br>
<br>
 Relying on one of the largest collections of liver 
tissue samples ever acquired by a single organization, Geisinger Health System 
researchers have embarked on a massive study of one of the fastest growing 
liver problems. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease starts with the accumulation 
of fat on the liver, which leads to inflammation and scarring. It can progress 
to the point of permanent liver damage and lead to the potentially fatal 
cirrhosis. If the damage becomes too great, a liver transplant may be needed. 
Linked to America&rsquo;s increasing obesity problem, doctors have predicted a 
steep increase in the coming years. The disease is asymptomatic in its early 
stages and many people don&rsquo;t know they have it initially.</p> 
<p> Geisinger Health System is leveraging several key system resources in an 
effort to develop a simple blood test to diagnose the disease. Early detection 
would likely help patients better manage the disease and could even save lives. 
Yet a major obstacle needs to be cleared first. Right now, the only way to 
definitely diagnose the disease is through a liver biopsy. However, biopsies 
can pose health risks because of the potential for bleeding from the liver or 
for infection. The goal is to develop a noninvasive blood test for the disease 
and then bring it to market so other physicians can use it, said Geisinger 
staff scientist Glenn S. Gerhard, MD. To that end, Geisinger is uniquely 
positioned to develop such a test because of the array of resources the system 
has at its disposal. Geisinger has collected more than 600 liver tissue and 
blood samples donated from patients who have undergone bariatric weight loss 
surgery. &ldquo;Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hasn&rsquo;t really been 
studied, in part, because investigators can&rsquo;t get access to 
samples,&rdquo; Gerhard said.</p> 
<p> The federal government estimates that the disease affects 2 to 5 percent 
of Americans, while another 10 to 20 percent of the population has fat in their 
liver, but no inflammation or liver damage. As part of the project, 
investigators from the Weis Center for Research, the Center for Health 
Research, the Center for Nutrition and Weight Management, and the Department of 
Surgery are combing through Geisinger&rsquo;s $80 million Electronic Health 
Record to learn why some obese and overweight people develop nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease and similar problems.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;We need to look at what causes this disease and how we can treat 
it,&rdquo; Gerhard said. A liver transplant costs about $370,000 on average, 
while bariatric surgery costs $40,000 in Pennsylvania, depending on the 
negotiated rate with the person&rsquo;s health plan. (These costs are not what 
the patient pays, but the average costs for the provider.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <br>
<b>Study shows hope for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's</b></p> 
<p> Research by faculty and staff at Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ; the 
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; and Drexel University may lead 
to better diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. In a $1.1-million 
National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s National Institute on Aging study that 
team members conducted during the last three years, they determined early 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s could be diagnosed with a high rate of accuracy evaluating 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The study may lead to an earlier diagnosis, 
and therefore earlier treatment and improved quality of life, for people at the 
earliest stages of the disease. Rowan University electrical and computer 
engineering associate professor Dr. Robi Polikar conducted the research with 
Dr. Christopher Clark, associate professor of neurology, associate director of 
the NIH-sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Center at Penn and director of the Penn 
Memory Center, and with Dr. John Kounios, a Drexel psychology professor. 
&ldquo;Individuals in the earliest stage of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are often 
not aware of their progressing memory loss, and family members often believe 
the changes are simply due to aging,&rdquo; Clark said. &ldquo;Even the 
patient&rsquo;s personal physician may be reluctant to initiate an evaluation 
until a considerable degree of brain failure has occurred. The advantage of 
using a modified EEG to detect these early changes is that it is non-invasive, 
simple to do, can be repeated when necessary and can be done in a 
physician&rsquo;s office. This makes it an ideal method to screen elderly 
individuals for the earliest indication of this common scourge of late 
life.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> The teams conducted several experiments, ultimately evaluating the 
parietal and occipital regions of the brains of 71 patients, some already 
diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and some without Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Their 
diagnostic accuracy rate was 82 to 85 percent using the EEGs (e.g., it matched 
evaluations conducted at Penn 82 to 85 percent of the time). Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
disease cannot be confirmed until a patient has died and his or her brain has 
been examined. Gold standard tests administered at world-class research 
facilities, such as Penn, have a 90-percent accuracy rate. However, most people 
are evaluated at community hospitals and clinics, where the diagnostic accuracy 
is estimated to be around 75 percent. Though the study&rsquo;s accuracy rate is 
under that 90-percent figure, it still means the test potentially could have 
great value to physicians and patients and their families, and the results are 
particularly significant for patients who have limited access to teaching 
hospitals, where they may undergo six to 12 months of evaluation for a 
diagnosis. The team members hope that eventually they or other researchers will 
develop a hand-held device that can be used to conduct similar evaluations as 
those done by the Rowan/Penn//Drexel group. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t envision this 
replacing a neurologist,&rdquo; Polikar said. &ldquo;We hope it can serve as a 
first test for those folks who don&rsquo;t have access to research 
facilities.&rdquo; If the initial test indicates a possible problem, physicians 
could refer the patient to a research hospital for further evaluation.<b>&nbsp;

<h2> FDA urgently warns consumers about health risks<br>
 of potentially 
contaminated olives</h2> 
<p> <br>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting consumers to 
possible serious health risks from eating olives that may be contaminated with 
a deadly bacterium,<em>Clostridium botulinum</em>. <em>C. botulinum</em> can 
cause botulism, a potentially fatal illness. The olives are made by Charlie 
Brown di Rutigliano &amp; Figli S.r.l, of Bari, Italy and are being recalled by 
the manufacturer. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with 
this recall. The olives should not be eaten alone or in other foods, even if 
they do not appear to be spoiled. Consumers should discard these products or 
return them to the point of purchase. If in doubt, consumers should contact the 
retailer and inquire whether its olives are part of the recall.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The olives are sold under the following brands: Borrelli, Bonta di 
Puglia, Cento, Corrado's, Dal Raccolto, Flora, Roland and Vantia, and have 
codes that start with the letter &ldquo;G&rdquo; and are followed by 3 or 4 
digits. All sizes of cans, glass jars and pouches of Cerignola, Nocerella and 
Castelvetrano type olives are affected. Symptoms of botulism include general 
weakness, dizziness, double vision, trouble with speaking or swallowing, 
difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and 
constipation. People experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical 
attention. Consumers may also report illnesses associated with consumption of 
these olives to the nearest FDA district offices. Charlie Brown di Rutigliano 
&amp; Figli S.r.l, initiated a recall of these olives on March 27, 2007. The 
recalled olives had been distributed to wholesalers, who have marketed them 
nationally to restaurants and retail stores. FDA concluded that additional 
warnings are needed because, to date, the company has not contacted importers 
with specific instructions on the recall. Consumers with questions may contact 
Charlie Brown Company at 011-039-080-7839073 or charliebrownbari@yahoo.com. </p>

<p> <b> CMS proposes payment reforms for inpatient hospital services in 2008
</b> </p> 
<p> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed 
rule that takes steps to improve the accuracy of Medicare&rsquo;s payment under 
the acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), while 
providing additional incentives for hospitals to engage in quality improvement 
efforts.&nbsp;The payment reforms include a proposal to restructure the 
inpatient diagnosis related groups (DRGs) to account more fully for the 
severity of the patient&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp;In addition, the proposed rule 
includes provisions to ensure that Medicare no longer pays hospitals for their 
additional costs of hospital-acquired conditions (including infections), and 
includes an expanded list of publicly reported quality measures.&nbsp;The 
proposed rule would also reduce payment for a DRG involving the implantation of 
a device, when a hospital replaces a device and the replacement is supplied to 
the hospital at no or reduced cost.&nbsp;Medicare&rsquo;s inpatient rates for 
operating expenses will increase by 3.3 percent in FY 2008 for those hospitals 
that report quality data to CMS.&nbsp;Overall, the proposed rule is estimated 
to increase payments to more than 3,500 acute care hospitals by $3.3 billion.
</p> 
<p> The proposed rule would create 745 new severity-adjusted diagnosis related 
groups (DRGs) (Medicare Severity DRGs or MS-DRGs) to replace the current 538 
DRGs. Projected aggregate spending from the reforms will not 
change.&nbsp;However, payments would increase for hospitals serving more 
severely ill patients and decrease for serving patients who are less severely 
ill.&nbsp;CMS is proposing to revise the current DRGs so that the system will 
continue to be based upon a non-proprietary case mix system making it available 
to the public. By more accurately recognizing the costs of caring for a 
patient, the new MS-DRGs will further reduce incentives for hospitals to 
&ldquo;cherry pick,&rdquo; the practice of treating only the healthiest and 
most profitable patients. They also address concerns that specialty hospitals 
may selectively provide such profitable services.</p> 
<p> For FY 2008, CMS is proposing to adopt a high cost outlier threshold of 
$23,015, down from $24,475 in FY 2007. By better recognizing severity of 
illness in the DRGs, fewer cases would be paid as outliers.&nbsp;However, CMS 
proposed to lower the outlier threshold to meet the legal requirement to 
continue paying between 5 and 6 percent of payments as outliers. The proposed 
rule recommends changes to the way Medicare pays for hospital capital-related 
costs based on an analysis that showed substantial positive margins experienced 
by some hospitals.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  The proposed rule would add five new quality measures, which would bring 
to 32 the number of measures hospitals would need to report in FY 2008 in order 
to qualify for the full market basket update in FY 2009.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The proposed rule would require physician-owned hospitals to disclose such 
ownership to patients and provide the names of the physician owners upon 
request.The proposed rule would also require physician-owned hospitals to 
require physician owners who are members of the hospital&rsquo;s medical staff 
to disclose their ownership to the patients they refer to the 
hospital.&nbsp;Disclosure would be required at the time of referral. The 
proposed rule would require a hospital to notify all patients in writing if a 
doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy is not present in the hospital 24 
hours a day, seven days per week, and describe how the hospital will meet the 
medical needs of a patient who develops an emergency condition while no doctor 
is on site.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Under the proposed rule, hospitals would be paid during 2008 based on a 
blend of one-third list charge-based weights and two-thirds hospital cost-based 
weights for the DRGs. In 2009, hospitals would be paid 100 percent based on 
cost-based DRG weights. Comments on the proposed rule will be accepted until 
June 12, 2007 and a final rule, to be effective for discharges on or after 
October 1, 2007, will be published later in the summer. To read the press

<b> Staph aureus infection rates on the rise in U.S. hospitals <br>

<br> </b>  Findings presented at the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of 
America annual meeting further demonstrate that there has been a significant 
increase in<i>Staphylococcus aureus </i> (commonly referred to as Staph aureus)
<i> </i>infection rates among patients in U.S. hospitals, resulting in longer 
hospitalizations and millions of dollars of excess healthcare costs. 
Researchers analyzed more than 45 million hospital discharge records and found 
that from 1998 to 2003 the prevalence of Staph aureus<i> </i>infection among 
all patients increased at an annual rate of 7.1 percent. The problem grew even 
faster among surgical patients; the rate of Staph aureus<i> </i>infection<i> 
</i>rose 7.9 percent each year for all surgical stays and 9.3 percent each year 
for orthopedic patients. </h2> 
<p> The studies, which were funded by 3M Health Care, were conducted by lead 
investigator Dr. Gary Noskin, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Feinberg 
School of Medicine, Northwestern University and Associate Chief Medical Officer 
at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. &ldquo;Staph aureus causes a wide range of 
infections, from mild skin infections to life-threatening blood stream 
infections,&rdquo; said Angela Dillow, PhD, Global Business Manager, 3M Medical 
Diagnostics. &ldquo;Identifying the bacteria and reducing its spread in 
hospitals is crucial to improving patient outcomes, and these findings 
underscore the need to control these infections.&rdquo; Prior to surgery, about 
one-third of patients carry Staph aureus<i> </i>in the nose, but do not have an 
infection. It is only if the bacteria enter other parts of the body, through a 
surgical incision, for example, that they can result in a serious infection. 
</p> 
<p> The researchers also presented findings on the economic impact of Staph 
aureus<i> </i>infections in hospitals and found that from 1998 to 2003 the 
economic burden among all Staph aureus<i>-</i>related inpatient stays increased 
from $8.7 billion to $14.5 billion, an annual increase of 11.9 percent. The 
costs of Staph aureus for invasive cardiovascular stays and invasive 
neurological stays rose at 12.4 percent a year and 13.5 percent a year, 
respectively. &ldquo;These findings clearly demonstrate the considerable 
economic implications of Staph aureus<i> </i> infections for hospitals 
nationwide,&rdquo; said Dr. Gary Noskin. &ldquo;It suggests that there could be 
large cost savings associated with aggressive efforts to prevent patients from 
becoming infected with these bacteria.&rdquo;</p> 
<h1>  Another abstract submitted by Dr. Noskin and colleagues at the meeting 
examined the economic benefit of screening for Staph aureus from nasal samples. 
The study showed rapid pre-admission testing for nasal Staph aureus and 
subsequent colonization suppression of carriers resulted in an average annual 
cost savings of approximately $519 million for U.S. hospitals. Researchers 
analyzed data from the 2003 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and published 
literature. Primary input variables included the marginal effect of Staph 
aureus infection on expenditures, prevalence of nasal Staph aureus carriage, 
sensitivity and specificity of the rapid Staph aureus screening device, 
efficacy of nasal Staph aureus colonization suppression and cost data. 
&ldquo;Rapid, pre-admission testing of patients could help hospitals better 
identify patients that are colonized with Staph aureus and in the appropriate 
setting attempt to decolonize them to help reduce the risk of infection and 
control costs,&rdquo; said Dillow.</h1>

<h1> Rhode Island Hospital study identifies high-risk patient populations for 
MRSA carriage</h1> 
<p> A study presented Saturday at the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of 
America (SHEA) annual meeting found that patients in long-term elder care and 
HIV-infected outpatients appear to be high-risk groups for carriage of 
methicillin-resistant<i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), a common cause for 
healthcare associated infections. &ldquo;MRSA can be spread in the healthcare 
environment and community and can cause serious infections,&rdquo; said lead 
investigator Leonard Mermel, MD, medical director, department of epidemiology 
&amp; infection control, Rhode Island Hospital.  &ldquo;Identifying patient 
populations that have a high risk of MRSA carriage is important in our efforts 
to control the spread of this microbe among patients.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 In the 
prospective, multi-center trial, which was funded by 3M Health Care, clinical 
nasal swabs were collected from various patient groups at 11 U.S. sites, 
including inpatients screened for MRSA through active surveillance, inpatients 
and outpatients requiring hemodialysis, inpatients and outpatients with 
HIV-infection, pre-op cardiac surgery patients and patients admitted from 
long-term elder care. Among patients at facilities that did not regularly 
screen for MRSA, prevalence of MRSA was highest in patients admitted from 
long-term care (18 percent) and HIV-infected outpatients (17 percent), 
suggesting these patient populations are at especially high risk of MRSA 
carriage. In addition, this trial is the first to look at the quantity of MRSA 
in the nares of different patient populations. Currently, the standard method 
to detect carriage of MRSA is by routine culture whereby results can take 
several days.  Delayed results can lead to MRSA transmission since potential 
MRSA carriers are often not isolated from patients without MRSA until these 
results are available.<br>
<b> <br>

<p><b> <br>
Rare case of dental patient-to-patient hepatitis B virus 
transmission recorded</b></p> 
<p> Researchers have documented a case of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission 
between two patients at a dentist&rsquo;s office in the United States. While 
this kind of infection is exceedingly rare, universal vaccination against the 
virus would likely have prevented both cases, according to the authors of the 
report and an accompanying commentary. Both appear in the May 1 issue of<i>The 
Journal of Infectious Diseases</i>, now available online. The case report, by 
John T. Redd, MD, MPH, and colleagues from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) and the New Mexico Department of Health, describes the index 
patient as a sexually inactive 60-year-old woman with no history of intravenous 
drug use or other potential exposures to HBV who had undergone multiple tooth 
extractions on a single office visit. A cross-match of the state&rsquo;s 
Hepatitis B Registry identified the source patient: a 36-year-old woman who had 
had teeth extracted hours earlier on the same day in the same office by the 
same surgeon and assistants, and receiving the same medications as the index 
patient. No evidence of HBV infection was found in any member of the office 
staff. Blood tests indicated that the source patient had had chronic HBV 
infection with a high viral load at the time of oral surgery.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Genetic analysis showed that virus of the same genotype and subtype was 
isolated from both patients, and that the isolates had identical DNA sequences 
in a sampled region. Medical records and blood tests of 25 patients operated on 
after the source patient showed that 16 (64 percent) were vaccinated and immune 
to HBV. &ldquo;I was pleasantly surprised by the high prevalence of 
immunity,&rdquo; commented Dr. Redd. &ldquo;It may have helped to limit spread 
of the virus.&rdquo; When investigators visited the office and monitored its 
operation they found all staff members followed standard infection control 
practices. The investigators could only speculate that there might have been a 
lapse in clean-up procedures after the source patient, leaving an area 
contaminated with her blood. HBV infection has long been a concern in dental 
infection control. The blood-borne pathogen is hardy, persisting in dried blood 
on surfaces for a week or more. It can be present even in the absence of 
visible blood. With routine vaccination against the virus in U.S. dental 
healthcare personnel over the last two decades, the incidence of HBV infection 
in this high-risk group has dramatically fallen, and no cases of 
dentist-to-patient HBV transmission have been reported in the U.S. since 1987. 
This is the only known case of patient-to-patient transmission in a dental 
setting.</p> 
<p> The authors concluded that the case underscored the need for meticulous 
maintenance of blood-borne pathogen infection control for all patients in 
dental settings. They also said that it reinforced the value of universal 
childhood HBV vaccination, which has been recommended in the U.S. since 1991. 
In an accompanying editorial, Ban Mishu Allos, MD, and William Schaffner, MD, 
of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, noted that adults account for most 
new cases of HBV infection in the United States, and that current 
recommendations based on such risk factors as sexual activity and intravenous 
drug use have resulted in meager vaccination rates. &ldquo;Fewer than 10 
percent of young adults with high-risk behaviors have received HBV 
vaccine,&rdquo; they said. In contrast, the incidence of HBV infection in 
children has been dramatically reduced by universal vaccination policies, and 
surgeon- and dentist-to-patient transmissions of the infection were essentially 
eliminated with routine vaccination of healthcare workers.</p>

<b>Premier healthcare alliance launches &lsquo;green&rsquo; 
best-practices Web site</b></p> 
<p> To help more hospitals share best practices for developing 
&ldquo;green&rdquo;, or environmentally sound, programs, the Premier Safety 
Institute recently launched a new public Web site, &ldquo;Green Corner.&rdquo; 
Located at www.premierinc.com/greencorner, the site showcases hospital and 
supplier success stories about &ldquo;green&rdquo; initiatives that contribute 
to a safer, healthier community environment. Stories are categorized under 
major topics, such as energy savings and waste reduction, making it easy for 
hospitals to find specific information on programs of interest. &ldquo;Going 
green&rdquo; not only is a smart way for hospitals to protect the environment, 
it also allows them to reduce operational costs, gain a competitive advantage 
and keep staff and patients satisfied.</p> 
<p> <br>
 &ldquo;&lsquo;Green Corner&rsquo; provides a valuable resource for 
healthcare professionals seeking anecdotes about how their peers in the 
hospital industry are tackling important community environmental issues, both 
simple and complex,&rdquo; said Gina Pugliese, RN, vice president of the 
Premier Safety Institute. Pugliese noted that such information can provide an 
important starting point for projects whose ultimate goal is to reduce waste, 
save money and protect a community's quality of life both now and for future 
generations.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The new site also complements the Safety Institute&rsquo;s free, 
electronic newsletter, &ldquo;Green Link,&rdquo; that highlights the latest 
news on &ldquo;green&rdquo; healthcare practices and purchasing. In addition, 
&ldquo;Green Corner&rdquo; expands the Premier Environmentally Preferable 
Purchasing (EPP) program&rsquo;s public suite of offerings, which currently 
includes electronic tools to support critical environmental efforts such as 
mercury pollution prevention and computer recycling. Premier&rsquo;s EPP 
program, a collaboration of the Safety Institute and Premier's group purchasing 
program, supports the efforts of members and the industry-at-large to enhance 
the safety and health of patients, healthcare workers and the environment. For 
example, on behalf of hundreds of hospitals and the communities they serve, the 
EPP program recently secured purchasing agreements with Dell and Gateway for 
computers and electronic devices that address significant environmental 
concerns regarding the manufacturing, use and end-of-life disposal and/or 
recycling of electronics.</p>

<b>Jani-King approves healthcare cleaning system</b></p> 
<p> After more than one year of research and testing, Jani-King International 
has partnered with Rubbermaid to officially implement a color-coded microfiber 
cleaning and disinfecting system into its standard environmental services 
program. Jani-King, a commercial cleaning franchise company, worked with 
Rubbermaid, a provider of high efficiency environmental services equipment, in 
order to adapt best practices, procedures and techniques for cleaning and 
disinfecting in a healthcare environment.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;For patients with weakened or susceptible immune systems, there is 
nothing more dangerous than increased bio load on healthcare surfaces,&rdquo; 
said Mark Regna, Director of Healthcare at Jani-King International. &ldquo;We 
labored for over a year testing and analyzing the Rubbermaid equipment and 
recommended procedures. What we have proven is that microfiber technology is 
highly effective in disinfecting surfaces while the use of a color-coded 
cleaning system greatly reduces the risk of cross transmission.&rdquo; 
Jani-King has already implemented this new cleaning and disinfecting standard 
into its healthcare certificate program. According to Regna, every Jani-King 
franchise owner and all environmental service staff must receive a healthcare 
certificate of completion by Jani-King prior to servicing a healthcare account.

 Hire Heroes, a program 
designed to help veterans with disabilities find careers in the healthcare 
industry, was launched today by Health Careers Foundation, a non-profit 
healthcare education organization. The announcement was made during the general 
session of the MedAssets&rsquo; Healthcare Business Summit in Las Vegas, NV. 
MedAssets is one of a number of healthcare companies providing funding to 
Health Careers Foundation. As part of the Health Careers Foundation, Hire 
Heroes will help veterans returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
Enduring Freedom with any level of disability as determined by the United 
States Department of Veterans Affairs. &ldquo;Through Health Careers 
Foundations&rsquo; connections within the healthcare industry, the Hire Heroes 
program will help thousands of our veterans with disabilities throughout our 
nation,&rdquo; said Clayton Shepherd, chief executive officer, Health Careers 
Foundation. &ldquo;By adding these honorable veterans to the healthcare 
industry, they will be able to continue to serve and to make a 
difference.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> Hire Heroes will identify veterans with disabilities who are seeking 
career placement services by working with transition centers and VA 
rehabilitation centers. Each applicant will be qualified and screened to 
determine career interests, job skills and location preferences. Additionally, 
Hire Heroes will work with potential employers by contacting interested 
healthcare companies to identify suitable positions for the veterans. Companies 
hiring veterans are eligible for a tax credit of $4,800 per hired</p> 
<p> hero and are entitled to a tax deduction for donations made to the 
program. The cost of ongoing operations will be covered by employer donations 
of $6,000 for each hired hero. Hire Heroes&rsquo; goal is to place more than 
8,000 heroes in jobs within the healthcare industry in the first three years of 
operation. The program start date is June 1. Efforts are underway to raise the 
necessary operating funds to make this program a success.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Our mission is to be the bridge to the right healthcare career fit 
for our returning heroes,&rdquo; said Bayne Tippins, director, Hire Heroes. 
&ldquo;Currently, there is a shortage of employees in the healthcare field. 
Hire Heroes will help to ease this shortage as well as ease the transition from 
military to civilian life.&rdquo; The Hire Heroes program was inspired by the 
experiences of Justin Callahan, who served as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army 
during Operation Iraqi Freedom and is now a corporate event planner for 
MedAssets. While undergoing treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 
Callahan met John Bardis, chairman, president and CEO of MedAssets, by chance 
in a hotel lobby. Bardis extended a job offer to Callahan that day, and Justin 
has been a MedAssets&rsquo; employee since he officially retired from the 
military three years ago. Callahan&rsquo;s experiences raised awareness and 
understanding of the challenges veterans with disabilities may face when 
re-entering and adjusting to the workplace, which led to the creation of Hire 
Heroes. &ldquo;This program gives guys a chance to start a new life and really 
opens paths for them,&rdquo; Callahan said. &ldquo;It is more than helping them 
out with a job. It&rsquo;s about helping them grow stronger mentally and 
emotionally to have a more normal life.&rdquo; To learn more about the Hire

<h2> <br>
CDC report highlights growing foodborne illness challenges; E. coli 
O157, Salmonella, Vibrio cause concern</h2> 
<p> <br>
 A report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) shows a leveling of cases for some foodborne infections after 
a period of decline. For others, incidences of infection which had declined 
appear to be returning to earlier levels. The findings are from 2006 data 
reported to the CDC as part of the agency&rsquo;s Foodborne Diseases Active 
Surveillance Network (also known as FoodNet). FoodNet monitors foodborne 
disease and related epidemiologic studies to help health officials better 
understand the epidemiology of foodborne diseases in the United States.<br>
<br>
 Camplylobacter, Listeria, Shigella and Yersinia show a sustained decline in 
incidence compared to baseline data from 1996-1998, but most of the decrease 
occurred between 1999 and 2002. The FoodNet data showed there continues to be 
little change in the incidence of Salmonella cases, and progress made in 2003 
and 2004 in reducing the number of cases of with E. coli O157 infections has 
been lost. Vibrio infections, which are often related to the consumption of raw 
shellfish like oysters, have increased to the highest level since FoodNet began 
conducting surveillance.&nbsp;The 2006 FoodNet data indicated that the 
incidence of infections caused by E. coli O157 and Salmonella was similar to 
1996-1998 baseline years.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The reasons for the lack of decrease in the incidence of infections caused 
by E. coli O157 and Salmonella are not fully understood. One possible 
explanation is the development of cases of disease in foods that previously 
were not associated with these diseases, such as spinach and peanut butter. 
Previous efforts to decrease the incidence of E. coli O157 in ground beef and 
Salmonella in eggs have been successful, but contamination of other foods may 
be the problem now, according to Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of 
CDC&rsquo;s Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases.</p> 
<p> <br>
 Consumers can reduce their risk for foodborne illness by following 
safe food-handling recommendations and by avoiding the consumption of 
unpasteurized milk, raw or undercooked oysters, raw or undercooked eggs, raw or 
undercooked ground beef, and undercooked poultry. The risk for foodborne 
illness can also be decreased by choosing in-shell pasteurized eggs, irradiated 
ground meat, and high pressure-treated oysters. The report appears in the April 
13 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report at THIS LINK http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/.

<h2> <br>
CDC changes recommendations for gonorrhea treatment due to drug 
resistance; Few treatment options remain</h2> 
<p> <br>
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) no longer 
recommends antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and 
levofloxacin) as a treatment for gonorrhea in the United States. This limits 
the options available to treat gonorrhea, one of the most common sexually 
transmitted diseases in the U.S. The recommendation was prompted by new data 
released today in CDC&rsquo;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 
showing that fluoroquinolone-resistant gonorrhea is now widespread in the 
United States among heterosexuals and men who have sex with men (MSM). The data 
showed the proportion of drug-resistant cases among heterosexuals rising above 
the recognized threshold of 5 percent for changing treatment recommendations. 
CDC had recommended fluoroquinolones no longer be used to treat gonorrhea in 
MSM when this threshold was crossed in earlier years.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The new data, from CDC&rsquo;s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance 
Project (GISP) in 26 U.S. cities, showed that among heterosexual men, the 
proportion of gonorrhea cases that were fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae (QRNG) reached 6.7 percent in the first half of 2006, an 11-fold 
increase from 0.6 percent in 2001. Recommended options for treating gonorrhea 
are now limited to a single class of antibiotics known as cephalosporins. 
Public health officials believe the lack of treatment options underscores the 
need for accelerated research into new drugs, as well as increased efforts to 
monitor for emerging drug resistance, especially to cephalosporins. While 
significant resistance to cephalosporins has not been observed to date, CDC is 
working with state and local health departments to monitor emerging 
cephalosporin resistance. CDC is urging health departments to maintain or 
develop capacity to perform cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and to assess 
any gonorrhea treatment failures for possible resistance. In addition, CDC is 
working with the World Health Organization to strengthen international efforts 
to monitor for the emergence of cephalosporin resistance and with government 
and industry partners to identify and evaluate promising new drug regimens.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The new CDC analysis shows an increase in the past five years in the 
overall proportion of gonorrhea cases that are fluoroquinolone-resistant, from 
less than 1 percent in 2001 to 13.3 percent in the first half of 2006. The 
analysis also indicated that fluoroquinolone resistance is widespread 
geographically. Resistant cases were seen across the U.S. in the first half of 
2006 (in 25 of the 26 cities in the analysis), and sharp increases occurred 
from 2004 to 2006 in several cities, including Philadelphia (from 1.2 percent 
to 26.6 percent of gonorrhea cases) and Miami (from 2.1 percent to 15.3 
percent). The analysis showed QRNG continued to rise among MSM; 38 percent of 
MSM gonorrhea cases were QRNG in the first half of 2006, compared to 1.6 
percent in 2001. Within the class of cephalosporins, CDC now recommends

Major genetic study identifies clearest link yet to obesity risk
</b></p> 
<p> Scientists have identified the most clear genetic link yet to obesity in 
the general population as part of a major study of diseases funded by the 
Wellcome Trust, the UK&rsquo;s largest medical research charity. People with 
two copies of a particular gene variant have a 70% higher risk of being obese 
than those with no copies. Scientists from the Peninsula Medical School, 
Exeter, and the University of Oxford first identified a genetic link to obesity 
through a genome-wide study of 2,000 people with type 2 diabetes and 3,000 
controls. This study was part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 
one of the biggest projects ever undertaken to identify the genetic variations 
that may predispose people to or protect them from major diseases. Through this 
genome-wide study, the researchers identified a strong association between an 
increase in BMI and a variation, or &ldquo;allele&rdquo;, of the gene FTO. 
Their findings are published online in the journal<i>Science</i>. The 
researchers then tested a further 37,000 samples for this gene from Bristol, 
Dundee and Exeter as well as a number of other regions in the UK and Finland. 
The study found that people carrying one copy of the FTO allele have a 30% 
increased risk of being obese compared to a person with no copies. However, a 
person carrying two copies of the allele has a 70% increased risk of being 
obese, being on average 3kg heavier than a similar person with no copies. 
Amongst white Europeans, approximately one in six people carry both copies of 
the allele.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;As a nation, we are eating more but doing less exercise, and so the 
average weight is increasing, but within the population some people seem to put 
on more weight than others,&rdquo; explains Professor Andrew Hattersley from 
the Peninsula Medical School. &ldquo;Our findings suggest a possible answer to 
someone who might ask &lsquo;I eat the same and do as much exercise as my 
friend next door, so why am I fatter?&rsquo; There is clearly a component to 
obesity that is genetic.&rdquo; The researchers currently do not know why 
people with copies of the FTO allele have an increased BMI and rates of 
obesity. &ldquo;Even though we have yet to fully understand the role played by 
the FTO gene in obesity, our findings are a source of great excitement,&rdquo; 
said Professor Mark McCarthy from the University of Oxford. &ldquo;By 
identifying this genetic link, it should be possible to improve our 
understanding of why some people are more obese, with all the associated 
implications such as increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. New 
scientific insights will hopefully pave the way for us to explore novel ways of 
treating this condition.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;This is an exciting piece of work that illustrates why it was so 
important to sequence the human genome,&rdquo; said Dr. Mark Walport, Director 
of the Wellcome Trust. &ldquo;Obesity is one of the most challenging problems 
for public health in the UK. The discovery of a gene that influences the 
development of obesity in the general population provides a new tool for 
understanding how some people appear to gain weight more easily than others. 
This discovery, along with further results expected from the Wellcome Trust 
Case Control Consortium later this year, will open up a wealth of new avenues 
to understand and treat common diseases.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

F.D.A. rejects Merck&rsquo;s new pain medication </h1> 
<p> <br>
 A panel of federal drug advisers voted 20 to 1 Thursday to reject an 
application by Merck to sell its pain pill Arcoxia because of concerns that the 
drug could cause as many as 30,000 heart attacks annually if widely used. Food 
and Drug Administration officials were unusually harsh in their criticism of 
the medicine. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re talking about is a potential public 
health disaster&rdquo; if Arcoxia is approved for sale, Dr. David Graham, an 
F.D.A. safety officer, told the panel. Arcoxia is a sister to Vioxx, which 
Merck withdrew in 2004 after a study showed that it also increased the risks of 
heart attacks and strokes. Merck sells Arcoxia in 63 countries, and the company 
underwrote an extensive safety testing program that involved 34,000 arthritis 
patients. The studies showed that Arcoxia caused nearly three times as many 
heart attacks, strokes and deaths as naproxen, a popular pain pill sold as 
Aleve, but was no more effective in curing pain. Patients taking Arcoxia 
suffered worrisome increases in blood pressure. A Merck spokeswoman, Kyra 
Lindemann, said the company was &ldquo;disappointed in today&rsquo;s 
outcome.&rdquo; &ldquo;We continue to believe that Arcoxia has the potential to 
become a valuable treatment option,&rdquo; Lindemann said, adding that Merck 
would continue to sell the drug outside the United States. (The New York Times)

<p><b> </b> More states adopt apology shield to protect doctors<br>
<br>

Lawmakers in Rhode Island and eight other states are now considering bills that 
would allow physicians to apologize and tell their patients, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 
sorry&rdquo; when things go wrong without having to fear that their words will 
be used against them in court. At least 27 other states have already passed 
similar laws, nearly all of them in the past four years, according to the 
American Medical Association. The wave of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; laws is 
part of a movement in the medical industry to encourage doctors to promptly and 
fully inform patients of errors and, when warranted, to apologize.<br>
<br>
 
Some hospitals say apologies help defuse patient anger and stave off lawsuits. 
At the same time, many doctors are trained or warned never to admit errors in 
case a patient sues. Apology laws vary by state. In Arizona, Connecticut, 
Idaho, Maine and 11 other states, doctors can safely apologize to or 
commiserate with patients or their families about an undesirable or unexpected 
outcome, according to the AMA. A law in Vermont exempts only oral statements of 
regret or apology, not written ones. Illinois gives doctors a 72-hour window to 
safely apologize after they learn about the cause of a medical mishap. 
Providence lawyer<br>
<br>
 Steven Minicucci, who handles malpractice suits, 
said displays of compassion are rarely useful in building such cases. But an 
apology and an admission of error could be key evidence. He opposes the Rhode 
Island legislation. &ldquo;I like to call it the 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m-sorry-I-killed-your-mother&rsquo; bill,&rdquo; Minicucci said. 
&ldquo;If a doctor comes out and says something like that, he shouldn&rsquo;t 
be able to immunize himself against statements like that by couching it in an 
apology.&rdquo; Boston-based ProMutual Group, which insures 18,000 healthcare 
clients in the Northeast, warns against apologies that admit guilt. &ldquo;We 
encourage physicians to apologize about the outcome, not necessarily for any 
error that may have occurred,&rdquo; ProMutual spokeswoman Nina Akerley said.

<p><b> Rheumatoid arthritis drug may help treat type 2 diabetes</b></p> 
<p> A drug designed to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis may also be helpful 
for managing type 2 diabetes, new research suggests. The study found that daily 
injections of anakinra led to a drop in long-term levels of glucose in the 
blood, while they increased in people given a placebo. &ldquo;We (showed) that 
a 13-week treatment with anakinra improves glucose regulation and insulin 
production in people with type 2 diabetes,&rdquo; said one of the study&rsquo;s 
authors, Dr. Marc Donath, an attending physician and a professor of 
endocrinology and diabetes at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland. The 
study is published in the April 12 issue of the<i>New England Journal of 
Medicine</i>. </p> 
<p> Sometimes, beta cells, insulin-producing cells, in the pancreas are 
destroyed in type 2 diabetes as they are in type 1 diabetes. Through previous 
research, Donath and his colleagues learned that a substance called 
interleukin-1 beta was a factor in the demise of these cells in people with 
type 2 diabetes. The drug anakinra is an interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, 
which means it can block the action of interleukin-1 beta. To assess whether or 
not this could have an effect on people with type 2 diabetes, the researchers 
randomly assigned 36 people to receive a once-daily placebo injection and 34 
people to receive once-daily injections of 100 milligrams of anakinra for 13 
weeks. After 13 weeks, the glycated hemoglobin levels were 0.46 percent lower 
in the group that received anakinra. Glycated hemoglobin, also referred to as 
glycosylated hemoglobin or A1C, is a test that measures the average amount of 
glucose in the blood for about three months. People without diabetes generally 
have levels around 5 percent. The higher the level, the greater the risk of 
diabetes complications, which can include heart disease, nerve damage, kidney 
failure and loss of vision. &ldquo;Our study is proof of concept for a 
mechanism underlying the disease and (may possibly) block its 
progression,&rdquo; said Donath, who added, &ldquo;Interleukin-1 beta may be 
involved in other complications of the disease, such as arteriosclerosis. 
Therefore, this therapy may also prevent cardiovascular events. However, this 
remains to be shown.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Anakinra was well tolerated by the study participants, and Donath and his 
colleagues plan on conducting larger, follow-up studies of the medication. 
&ldquo;This study points to inflammation as definitely having a role in the 
(diabetes) story,&rdquo; said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at New York 
University Medical Center, and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at 
the New York University School of Medicine. But, Weiss said that while this 
avenue of research is &ldquo;worth pursuing, I wouldn&rsquo;t get my hopes up 
for a clinical application, especially since the drug appears to lose its 
effectiveness over time.&rdquo; Additionally, Weiss pointed out that it 
appeared the drug was more effective in thinner people. &ldquo;The authors 
don&rsquo;t really discuss this, but it&rsquo;s an interesting finding; 
it&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;d expect.&rdquo; (HealthDay News)</p>

<h1> Massachusetts offers details on health coverage </h1> 
<p> <br>
 Massachusetts is poised to become the first state to make it 
possible for 99 percent of its adults to be covered by health insurance, with 
an ambitious plan that sets limits for the premiums people would be expected to 
pay. State officials said that under the plan, they expected that all but about 
65,000 of the 328,000 adults who are currently uninsured would be able to get 
affordable coverage. The proposal sets a sliding scale of affordability 
standards in which, for example, a single person earning $40,001 a year would 
be expected to pay no more than 9 percent of income, or about $300 a month, for 
health insurance; a single person earning $25,000 a year would be expected to 
pay a much smaller percentage, about 3.3 percent of income, or $70 a month.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The plan is expected to be approved by the Commonwealth Health Insurance 
Connector Authority on Thursday. Jon Kingsdale, the executive director of the 
authority, the agency set up to administer the plan, said setting the 
affordability standards &ldquo;was always the most difficult and innovative 
element&rdquo; of the state&rsquo;s groundbreaking healthcare law, passed a 
year ago. The law required all residents to get health insurance or face a fine 
or tax penalty. But from the beginning, there was concern that available health 
plans might be too expensive for some people, or, that some affordable plans 
might provide skimpy coverage. Last month, the authority voted to require all 
plans to have substantial coverage, including prescription drug benefits, which 
raised further questions about how expensive the insurance would be. &ldquo;To 
do this right means we&rsquo;re walking a tight rope,&rdquo; Kingsdale said. 
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be too punitive, we don&rsquo;t want to put too 
high a standard of affordability, but we don&rsquo;t want to let too many 
people out of a universal requirement. We&rsquo;ve been putting a lot of stakes 
in the ground, but this is the center pole that will allow us to put up the 
tent and get everybody covered.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The plan, if approved Thursday, would still need to be presented at public 
hearings across the state and face a final vote in June. The proposal would 
cost the state $13 million more than the $200 million it was planning to spend. 
This proposal changes premiums and subsidy rates that were established earlier. 
It would allow about 52,000 more low-income people to qualify for free or 
cheaper coverage. A person earning up to $15,315, one and half times the 
federal poverty level, would not have to pay anything under this proposal. 
Individuals earning $30,630 to $50,001 would not be eligible for state 
subsidies, but they would not be penalized if they could not find health 
insurance priced at $150 to $300 a month. People who earn more than $50,001 
would not be given a cap on insurance costs. People who claim they cannot 
afford coverage under the new system could apply for a waiver.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The proposal represents a carefully hammered-out compromise. Business 
groups wanted to make sure that premiums for state-sponsored insurance would 
not be too much less than the employee contributions to an employer&rsquo;s 
plan because they fear that people would flock to the government-sponsored 
plans, driving up the cost to the state. Advocates for poor people had wanted 
lower costs for more residents. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t go the whole way, but 
it&rsquo;s good enough for today,&rdquo; said John McDonough, executive 
director of Health Care for All, an advocacy group. Leslie A. Kirwan, the 
Massachusetts secretary of administration and finance, who is chairwoman of the 
authority&rsquo;s board, said the support of advocates like McDonough was 
earned in part by action by Gov. Deval L. Patrick, who agreed to waive fees 
that more than 10,000 poor families were paying for their children to be 
covered by Medicaid. (The New York Times)</p>

<b>Medicare provides funding for health insurance counseling in all 
50 states</b>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Medicare will provide funding for health insurance counseling in every 
state to help beneficiaries get the most from the health program for elderly 
and disabled persons, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 
announced. Each state will receive a share of $30 million in grant funds so 
state agencies can bring personalized assistance to people with Medicare at the 
local level. Under the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs), CMS 
provides funding to 54 SHIPs, including all&nbsp; 50 states, and the District 
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands. SHIPs are a key part of 
Medicare&rsquo;s education and outreach efforts to educate beneficiaries about 
health insurance coverage, including Medigap, Medicare Advantage options, 
Medicare prescription drug coverage, and long-term care financing. In recent 
months, they assisted millions of beneficiaries with finding drug plans suited 
to their individual needs. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  SHIP counselors will continue to provide enrollment assistance to 
Medicare beneficiaries and offer personalized counseling regarding all of their 
Medicare benefits, including new preventive health screenings and services. 
Through counseling, education and outreach, networks of local programs are 
helping beneficiaries understand and utilize their Medicare benefits. SHIPs are 
intended to serve beneficiaries who want information, counseling, and 
assistance beyond what is available through other CMS channels, including 
1-800-MEDICARE andwww.medicare.gov.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  To help them succeed, CMS will continue to provide training for SHIP 
counselors and full access to computer programs and other support tools, such 
as the Plan Finder tool and Tip Sheets, developed by CMS to help SHIPs with 
outreach and other functions. SHIP grants are calculated in two parts. The 
initial grant is distributed as a fixed award of $75,000 ($25,000 to Guam and 
the Virgin Islands) to each of the applicants. The second portion is a variable 
sum based on the percentage of nationwide Medicare beneficiaries who live in 
the state, the proportion of the state&rsquo;s Medicare beneficiaries to the 
total state population, and the proportion of the state&rsquo;s Medicare 
beneficiary population who live in rural areas. For a complete list of state

<h3> Scientists stop genes that help breast cancer to spread</h3> 
<p>  U.S. scientists have demonstrated a way to stop breast cancer spreading 
to other parts of the body by either switching off the genes involved or 
blocking them with drugs. The study is published in the journal<i>Nature</i>. 
Tumours formed from cancer that has spread or metastased from the primary site 
to other parts of the body cause 90 percent of cancer deaths. The process of 
metastasis or cancer spread is still much of a mystery to scientists. They 
can&rsquo;t tell the difference between a tumour that won't spread and one that 
will. And why, when hundreds of tumour cells get into the bloodstream every 
day, do only a small number of them take up residence in a new site and start 
multiplying?<br>
<br>
 Dr. Joan Massagu&eacute; from the Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has been working in this field for 
some time. He and his team have been looking at cell regulation and how it 
helps cancer cells to spread to specific tissues. In 2005, they found a number 
of genes that help breast cancer to metastase to the lungs. In this new study, 
they have identified four genes in particular that work together to help cells 
from the primary site to settle at a new site and grow. The four genes are: 
EREG, MMP1, MMP2 and COX2. Dr Massagu&eacute; and his team performed two types 
of experiments. In one they switched off the genes, and in another they 
targeted them with drugs. In the first experiment they took human breast cancer 
cells and switched off all four genes before inserting them into mice. The 
tumours did not grow, and metastasis to the lungs was greatly reduced. However, 
when they only silenced the genes individually, the effect was nowhere near as 
dramatic.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  In the second experiment they used a combination of three drugs to 
inhibit the action of the genes. Two of the drugs have already been approved 
for clinical use: cetuximab and celecoxib, while the third, GM6001, is still 
experimental. The drugs had a similar effect to switching the genes off. And 
the two approved drugs without the experimental one also stopped the cancer 
from spreading. In speculating on the results, the team suggested the four 
genes have to work together to help both tumour growth and spread. They said 
the genes probably hijack blood vessels and make them feed the tumour instead 
of healthy cells. Then they help tumour cells get into the bloodstream, 
penetrate capillary walls in the lungs, become established, and start 
multiplying. So far Dr. Massagu&eacute; and his team have been working with 
mice; they hope to set up trials with humans very soon. Since two of the drugs 
are already approved for clinical use, this should speed things up. However, 
other scientists would prefer to wait for the results of human trials before 
getting too excited. The next stage, said Dr. Massagu&eacute;, is to find women 
whose breast cancer relies on these four genes. Then they can test whether the 
drugs they used with the mice will stop the metastasis to the lungs in humans. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Many scientists believe that cancer spread starts after the primary 
tumour has reached maturity. But this research challenges that and suggests 
that cancer cells start migrating to other sites from the start. And the same 
genes that drive the growth of the primary tumour also help the cells to move 
and settle somewhere else. Another potential contribution this study makes is 
the possibility that these same genes are involved in fuelling metastasis of 
other cancers, or at least that similar rules are involved. That is the hope 
expressed by Christoph Klein, who studies metastasis at the University of 
Regensburg in Germany. While this study sheds valuable light on the mystery of 
metastasis, there are still areas that puzzle experts. For instance, some 
patients are diagnosed with metastased tumours without the primary tumour every 
being found. And nobody knows why different cancers spread to particular 
tissues, such as why breast cancer travels to lung and bone in particular.

<p><b> Egyptian girl dies of bird flu</b></p> 
<p> A 15-year-old Egyptian girl who tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu 
virus has died in hospital, bringing the number of deaths from the disease in 
Egypt to 14, the health ministry said on Wednesday. A ministry statement said 
Marianna Kameel Mikhail, who was admitted to hospital in Cairo on Thursday, 
died of respiratory failure on Tuesday evening despite being treated with the 
antiviral Tamiflu and being placed on a respirator. None of her family was 
found to have bird flu, it added. &ldquo;This case is the 14th death from 34 
cases of bird flu infection since the disease appeared in Egypt in February 
2006,&rdquo; the statement said. Egypt has the highest number of confirmed 
human bird flu cases outside Asia. (Reuters)</p>

<p> Medicare proposes revised clinical trial policy </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced its 
proposed revisions to the Clinical Trial Policy national coverage determination 
(NCD).&nbsp;Under the Clinical Trial Policy, first developed in September 2000, 
Medicare pays for certain items and services for Medicare beneficiaries 
involved in clinical trials. &ldquo;This new decision will signal our continued 
support to provide access to services for beneficiaries by facilitating 
participation in the full range of qualified, scientifically sound research 
projects,&rdquo; said CMS Acting Administrator Leslie V. Norwalk, Esq.&nbsp;In 
developing the revised clinical trial policy, CMS convened the Medicare 
Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee (MedCAC) on December 13, 
2006. The MedCAC proposed several recommendations, subsequently reviewed by a 
federal panel led by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). In 
addition to AHRQ, the federal panel included representatives from CMS, FDA, 
CDC, HRSA and the NIH.&nbsp;Based on the recommendations from the MedCAC and 
the federal panel, CMS is proposing to revise its Clinical Trial Policy.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Highlights of the proposed changes include: Renaming the policy as the 
Clinical Research Policy;&nbsp;Adding FDA post-approval studies and coverage 
with evidence development (CED) to studies that would qualify under this 
policy; Requiring all studies to be registered on the NIH ClinicalTrials.gov 
website before enrollment begins; Requiring studies to publish their results; 
Paying for investigational clinical services if they are covered by Medicare 
outside the trial or required under an CED through the NCD process; and 
Expanding the &ldquo;deeming&rdquo; agencies to all DHHS Agencies, the Veterans 
Administration, or the Department of Defense.&nbsp; Deeming agencies are 
agencies that can &ldquo;deem&rdquo; whether a trial has met the general 
standards outlined in the policy.<br>
<br>
 The proposed NCD opens a 30-day 
comment period.&nbsp;CMS will review all the public comments and suggestions 
received and incorporate them into a final NCD. CMS will publish the final NCD 
no later than sixty days after the end of the comment period. The revised 
policy will be effective with the publication of the final NCD. For details see

<p><b> Diabetes may be associated with increased risk of mild cognitive 
impairment</b></p> 
<p> Individuals with diabetes may have a higher risk of developing mild 
cognitive impairment, a condition that involves difficulties with thinking and 
learning and may be an intermediate step toward Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, 
according to a report in the April issue of<i>Archives of Neurology</i>, one of 
the<i>JAMA/Archives</i> journals. &ldquo;Among cardiovascular risk factors, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus has been consistently related to a higher risk of 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,&rdquo; the authors write. Mild cognitive 
impairment-particularly a type known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 
which affects memory more significantly than non-amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment-is increasingly recognized as a transitional state between normal 
functioning and Alzheimer's disease.&nbsp;Jos&eacute; A. Luchsinger, M.D., and 
colleagues at Columbia University Medical Center, NY, studied 918 individuals 
older than 65 years (average age 75.9) who did not have mild cognitive disorder 
or dementia when they enrolled between 1992 and 1994.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the beginning of the study and again every 18 months through 2003, each 
participant underwent an in-person interview and standard assessment, which 
included a medical history, physical and neurological examination, and a 
battery of neurological tests that measured learning, memory, reason and 
language skills, among others.&nbsp;Of the participants, 23.9 percent had 
diabetes, 68.2 percent had hypertension, 33.9 percent had heart disease and 15 
percent had had a stroke. During an average of 6.1 years of follow-up, 334 
individuals developed mild cognitive impairment, including 160 amnestic cases 
and 174 non-amnestic cases.&nbsp;Diabetes was related to a significantly higher 
risk of mild cognitive impairment overall and of amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment specifically after controlling for other factors that may affect 
risk, including age, ethnic group, years of education and heart and blood 
vessel disease.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The risk of mild cognitive impairment attributable to diabetes was 
8.8 percent for the whole sample, 8.4 percent for African-American persons, 11 
percent for Hispanic persons and 4.6 percent for non-Hispanic white persons, 
reflecting the differences in diabetes prevalence by ethnic group,&rdquo; the 
authors write. Diabetes could be related to a higher risk for amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment by directly affecting the build-up of plaques in the 
brain, a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, the authors 
note.&nbsp;In addition, cerebrovascular disease-diseases such as stroke that 
affect the vessels supplying blood to the brain-is related to both diabetes and 
Alzheimer's disease. &ldquo;Our results provide further support to the 
potentially important independent role of diabetes in the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,&rdquo; the authors conclude.&nbsp;&ldquo;Diabetes 
may also be a risk factor for non-amnestic forms of mild cognitive impairment 
and cognitive impairment, but our analyses need to be repeated in a larger 
sample.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> Diabetes can lead to host of consequences</b></p> 
<p> The rate of complications from diabetes is high, says a report, The State 
of Diabetes Complications in America, being released today by the American 
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. It shows that nearly 60% of people 
with diabetes have at least one of the complications caused by long-term 
failure to control the high blood-sugar levels tied to the disease. Most of the 
complications could have been avoided with early diagnosis and aggressive 
treatment, said Daniel Einhorn of La Jolla, CA, an endocrinologists association 
board member. High levels of sugar in the blood can damage veins, causing 
vision loss, kidney disease and loss of circulation to the legs and feet that 
can result in amputation. Diabetes contributes to stroke and heart disease. 
Einhorn says studies show that intense, early treatment with improved diet, 
daily exercise and medications when needed can lower blood-sugar levels and 
prevent or at least delay complications. But &ldquo;the report shows we are 
failing in the primary mission of preventing complications,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;The problem is that people don&rsquo;t recognize diabetes early enough, 
so by the time of diagnosis, about half of people with diabetes already have a 
complication that took years to develop.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Based on data from national surveys, the report is the first to combine 
economic and health data on type 2 diabetes complications, says the 
endocrinologists association, which prepared it with the Amputee Coalition of 
America, Mended Hearts, the National Federation of the Blind and the National 
Kidney Foundation. It estimates the cost of treating complications at $22.9 
billion in 2006, said University of Chicago health economist Willard Manning, 
who contributed to the analysis. He says people with diabetic complications 
face health costs three times those of non-diabetics and can expect to spend an 
average $1,600 per year in out-of-pocket expenses for care that averages nearly 
$10,000 a year, most of it paid by insurance. The report, which was paid for by 
drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline, notes that the prevalence of complications 
is greater in blacks (about 59%) than whites (about 55%), and highest in 
Hispanics (about 68%). Einhorn says diabetes, like high blood pressure or high 
cholesterol, is painless and easy to ignore until it has already caused damage. 
&ldquo;There is a huge cost to denial of this disease,&rdquo; he said. (USA

<p><b> ACS Report: Progress against cancer at risk; early detection, 
prevention need more attention &nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>The United States has made great strides against cancer recently, with 
overall deaths from the disease declining for 2 years in a row. But a new 
report from the American Cancer Society warns that this progress is threatened 
by disturbing trends in cancer prevention and early detection efforts. Tobacco 
control and cancer screening are of particular concern, according to Cancer 
Prevention and Early Detection Facts &amp; Figures 2007 (CPED), the annual ACS 
report examining the factors that influence cancer cases and deaths. The 
ever-expanding waistlines of both adults and children in America are also a 
serious problem. &ldquo;Much of the suffering and death from cancer could be 
prevented by more systematic efforts to reduce tobacco use, improve diet, 
increase activity levels, and expand the use of established screening 
tests,&rdquo; said John R. Seffrin, PhD, national chief executive officer of 
the American Cancer Society. &ldquo;But this report shows we may be losing 
momentum in some key areas that have been critical to our success.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Tobacco use is expected to cause some 168,000 cancer deaths this year 
alone, and overall it&rsquo;s the single largest preventable cause of disease 
and death in the US. Smoking causes cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth and 
throat, esophagus, and bladder, and contributes to several other types of 
cancer. About 40% of the recent decline in cancer deaths among men is due to 
declines in their smoking rates over the past 50 years, the report says. 
Although smoking rates among both youth and adults began dropping in 1997, that 
decline appears to have stalled. Smoking rates among high school students did 
not change significantly between 2003 and 2005, the report says. Likewise, 
adult smoking rates were also basically unchanged from 2004 to 2005. Higher 
tobacco taxes, restrictions on smoking in public places, counter-advertising, 
and coverage for quit-smoking programs and services are all effective means of 
curbing tobacco use. Funding for such programs falls far short of what is 
needed, the report says. For every $1 spent on tobacco control in the US in 
2003, the tobacco industry spent $23 promoting products. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>More money is also needed for cancer screening programs that help people 
with low incomes or no insurance. Cancer screening tests can find the disease 
at its earliest stage, when treatments are more likely to be successful. ACS is 
pressing Congress to boost funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer 
Early Detection Program, run by the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Although this program helps more than 400,000 women get the 
mammograms and Pap tests they need every year, that&rsquo;s just 13% of the 
uninsured and low income women eligible for this lifesaving program. Even women 
with health insurance are falling behind in their mammograms. The American 
Cancer Society recommends annual tests for women 40 and older. Yet in 2003, 
just 55% of women in this group said they&rsquo;d had a mammogram in the 
previous year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Only around 42% of adults 50 and older have been screened for colorectal 
cancer in the appropriate time frame. Insurance coverage is a major issue: only 
17% of uninsured people have been tested, compared to 44% of those with health 
insurance. Low colorectal cancer screening rates are a concern because unlike 
screening for many other cancers, colorectal cancer screening can find colon 
growths called polyps before they ever become cancerous, preventing the disease 
entirely. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> About two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, and only a fraction 
get the exercise needed to help stave off weight gain or lose weight. About 
one-third of US cancer deaths are related to excess weight, poor nutrition, and 
lack of physical activity, the report notes. Being too heavy is clearly linked 
with many cancers, including cancer of the breast, colon, endometrium, 
esophagus, and kidney. The CPED report says community efforts are needed to 
make our environment more conducive to good food and exercise choices. It calls 
for limits on junk food marketing in schools, encouraging more nutrition 
information in restaurants, stronger physical education requirements in 
schools, and more investment in parks, bike lanes, and sidewalks. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The report also calls for greater efforts to educate the public about sun 
safety, staying out of the sun during peak hours, using sunscreen and 
protective clothing, and keeping to the shade. Getting sunburned can increase 
the risk of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <b> VHA introduces a new tool to improve capital budgeting efficiency for 
hospitals</b></p> 
<p>The hospital capital budgeting process is often a time-consuming venture 
that requires department managers to conduct their own research, estimate costs 
and manually place data into Excel spreadsheets to submit to the 
hospital&rsquo;s chief financial officer. To solve this problem, VHA Inc., the 
national health care alliance, and Attainia Inc., a provider of capital 
equipment planning systems in healthcare, have co-developed a new Web-based 
software product to simplify and streamline the capital budgeting process. 
Budget BuilderSM, developed exclusively for VHA members, automates the 
budgeting process and helps hospitals identify cost-saving opportunities that 
previously may have gone unnoticed. &ldquo;The annual capital budgeting effort 
is painful for hospitals, which have been forced to develop budgets with 
inaccurate or out-of-date information using labor-intensive processes,&rdquo; 
said Nik Fincher, senior director of capital asset services for VHA. 
&ldquo;With Budget Builder, hospitals have fast access to real cost information 
that will ensure that budgets are more accurate. For example, a hospital with a 
$10 million overall capital budget can save between $3 million and $3.5 million 
by using the cost-cutting information contained in Budget Builder.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> Budget Builder provides members with list pricing information for more 
than 17,000 equipment items and over 1,500 suppliers. It also includes 
up-to-date pricing that factor in the contract discounts and tiered pricing 
structures offered through Novation, VHA&rsquo;s contracting services company. 
It also links seamlessly with other Attainia&rsquo;s software products that VHA 
members may have purchased. VHA member Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte, 
NC, helped pilot the Budget Builder software tool. Michael Rush, director of 
materials resource management for Carolinas, said the health system wanted to 
improve the capital budgeting process and fix the current flawed process. 
&ldquo;The problem we were facing was buying equipment sporadically and not 
knowing who and where and when they were being bought. We saw the need to 
purchase capital equipment in bulk. This is where the reports generated by 
Budget Builder come into play,&rdquo; said Rush. Because Budget Builder is 
Web-based, hospitals do not need to purchase new hardware or install new 
software. </p>

<p><b> Women under-treated for ovarian cancer</b></p> 
<p> Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal cancers women can get, yet one 
out of three U.S. patients diagnosed with the disease doesn&rsquo;t get the 
full, recommended surgical treatment, a new study finds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very 
concerning that we see such a large proportion of women with ovarian cancer not 
being treated up to what we would consider a minimal standard for 
surgery,&rdquo; said the study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Barbara A. Goff, 
director of the division of gynecologic oncology at the University of 
Washington, Seattle. Her team published the findings online April 9 in the 
journal<i>Cancer</i>. According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer 
is diagnosed in about 24,000 women in the United States each year, and 14,300 
die annually from the disease. The cancer typically shows few symptoms until it 
is diagnosed in its advanced stages. The new study builds on previous research, 
Goff said. &ldquo;People [in previous studies] have looked at this on a 
state-by-state basis. What this study really did was look across a broad 
geographic area of the U.S. It gave us a good sense of what is happening in our 
country,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Minorities, women who live in low-income 
areas, elderly women [over 70] and those who live in rural areas are 
significantly less likely to get comprehensive care compared to those women who 
don&rsquo;t meet those [criteria],&rdquo; according to Goff. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Seattle team analyzed hospital data from up to nine states for the 
period between 1999 to 2002, looking at factors associated with comprehensive 
surgical care. Only 67 percent of the 10,432 women whose cases were reviewed 
got the recommended comprehensive surgical procedures. A third of women were 
treated at a hospital that performed fewer than 10 ovarian cancer surgeries a 
year, not at the high-volume facilities that are considered superior. Almost 
half received treatment from a surgeon who performed fewer than 10 such 
procedures a year, not the best scenario for a good outcome. One-fourth got 
care from a doctor who did only one ovarian cancer surgery annually. Much 
previous research has found that women who are treated by specialists, in this 
case gynecologic oncologists, have better survival, and that those who have 
complete removal of the tumor (which is more often done by a specialist) have 
better survival. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>An opinion issued by the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists in 2002 stressed the importance of referral to a gynecologic 
oncologist if ovarian cancer is suspected. A U.S. National Institutes of Health 
consensus panel issued similar recommendations on comprehensive surgery for 
ovarian cancer more than a decade ago. Another expert said the study confirms 
the importance of seeing a gynecologic oncologist, as the ACOG opinion 
recommends. &ldquo;It matters who does the surgery,&rdquo; said Dr. Ilana Cass, 
director of the gynecologic oncology fellowship program at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, Los Angeles, and a gynecologic oncologist. The new study, she added, 
has more complete numbers than previous research. The experts&rsquo; prime 
advice for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer or suspected ovarian cancer: 
Seek out a specialist. The problem, Goff said, is that the diagnosis is usually 
made at the time of surgery. If ovarian cancer is even suspected, she said, 
women should seek a referral to a center with a high volume of ovarian cancer 
surgeries, performed by a specialist. She defines &ldquo;high volume&rdquo; as 
10 or more such surgeries per year. If a woman cannot find a center that does 
10-plus procedures, finding a center and a physician that does at least more 
than one a year is next-best option. &ldquo;Those doctors who did 2 to 10 
ovarian cancer surgeries were significantly better than those who did only 
one,&rdquo; Goff noted. Cass agreed that asking to be referred to a high-volume 
center and to be seen by a physician who is a gynecologic oncologist are both 
good steps. (HealthDay News)</p>

<p><b> VA takes the lead in paperless care</b></p> 
<p> Since 1999, the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; 155 hospitals, 881 
clinics, 135 nursing homes and 45 rehabilitation centers have been linked by a 
universal medical records network. It allows any authorized person to look at 
5.3 million patients&rsquo; records, everything from a nurse&rsquo;s note 
written during a hospital stay, to the result of a blood test drawn at a clinic 
visit, to the moving-picture film of a coronary angiogram done in a cardiology 
lab. The Department of Veterans Affairs is today one of the few health systems, 
and by far the largest, that is virtually paperless. A study commissioned by 
the Department of Health and Human Services last fall reported that one-quarter 
of American physicians use some sort of electronic record-keeping in their 
practices. But less than 10 percent have systems that store all necessary data, 
allow electronic ordering of tests and provide clinical reminders. Only 5 
percent of the country&rsquo;s 6,000 hospitals have computerized ordering of 
drugs and tests, and even fewer have a fully integrated system like the 
VA&rsquo;s. Although some people believe making medical records widely 
available to many practitioners is a threat to privacy, VA officials believe 
strongly that patient privacy is more secure now than in the era of paper 
charts. In the past 2 1/2 years, the VA has investigated 20 complaints of 
security breaches. Seventeen were for patient records accessed by unauthorized 
people, and three were for release of medical data to third parties without 
patient consent, VA spokeswoman Jo Schuda said.</p> 
<p>In the popular mind, the chief deficit in medical records is legible 
handwriting. But that doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe the problem. Many 
hospitals have multiple paper charts for each patient, one for hospital stays, 
another for clinic visits and others for specialty services such as physical 
therapy. Information is passed via carbons, faxes and letters. (Before the VA 
got its electronic system, only 60 percent of patients&rsquo; charts could be 
found on any given visit.) Looking at X-rays and imaging scans is equally 
inconvenient and unpredictable, requiring trips to a film library and luck that 
the right folder can be retrieved. Electronic medical records eliminate those 
headaches. Searchable computerized databases also allow physicians to examine 
information collected across time and space. (In the case of the VA, a doctor 
in Washington can easily find a blood test from a patient treated five years 
ago at the San Francisco veterans hospital.) &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ability to detect trends in physiological variables such as serum 
chemistry, cell counts, blood pressure and even weight is important to good 
decision-making. But it is often hard to do. Electronic medical records make it 
easier. &nbsp;Electronic record systems also bridge one of the more perilous 
chasms in medicine: the transfer of care when patients leave the hospital. Two 
years ago, a study of 2,600 patients discharged from university hospitals found 
that 41 percent had test results pending when they left. One in 10 of those 
tests eventually proved abnormal enough to warrant action, more testing, a new 
diagnosis or a change in treatment. However, other research has shown that up 
to 85 percent of patients visit their primary care doctors, who these days are 
likely to have had little if any role in their hospital care,<i>before</i> a 
summary of their last hospitalization arrives. A 2003 study showed that 49 
percent of patients suffered at least one medical error in the two months after 
leaving the hospital, often because the outside doctors didn&rsquo;t know what 
was done in the hospital, or what was left to do.<br>
 Electronic records are 
especially helpful in managing prescription drugs. The VA software flags 
questionable doses and potential interactions. Hospitalized patients have bar 
codes on their wristbands that are scanned for an identity check each time a 
pill is dispensed or an injection given. The computer system tells 
practitioners not only what a patient has been prescribed but what he has 
actually picked up from the pharmacy.</p> 
<p>  Th<i>e</i> VA is now rolling out &ldquo;My Health e Vet,&rdquo; a feature 
that allows patients to create a portal to their own charts, where they can 
record measurements they take at home; list over-the-counter medicines they 
use; and offer comments about their health. Electronic records can also improve 
physician performance. They can warn of things that shouldn&rsquo;t be done, 
provide reminders of what should be done and monitor what<i>is</i> done. A 
study published in 2004 compared the care of VA and non-VA patients in 12 
communities, using 348 quality indicators as the yardstick. VA patients scored 
higher on overall quality, chronic disease care and preventive care.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Electronic records appear to be money-saving devices, at least in some 
hands. By one estimate, they could save American medical care $162 billion a 
year. Many hospital systems, however, balk at the upfront investment, which can 
range from &ldquo;a few million to 50 to 60 million dollars,&rdquo; said Pat 
Wise, an executive with Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. 
The cost of the VA&rsquo;s electronic medical record, called VistA (for 
Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture), is hard to measure. 
It was developed over many years by many people, including hundreds of 
clinicians. However, the software is now free to anyone who wants to get it 
through the Freedom of Information Act. (Washington Post) To read the original

<p> Statin drugs lower respiratory death risk</p> 
<p> <br>
 People who use statin drugs are less likely to die of influenza and 
chronic bronchitis, according to a study that shows yet another unexpected 
benefit of the cholesterol-lowering medications. Their study of more than 
76,000 people showed that those who had taken statins for at least 90 days had 
a much lower risk of dying from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, 
the technical name for emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Patients on statins 
also had a lower risk of dying from influenza or pneumonia, the researchers 
reported Monday. Statins, which include Pfizer Inc.&rsquo;s $10 billion-a-year 
Lipitor, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&rsquo;s Pravachol and Merck and Co. 
Inc.&rsquo;s Zocor, are the world&rsquo;s best-selling drugs, taken by millions 
to reduce the risk of heart attack.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The new study supports a theory proposed last year that statin drugs might 
help patients with H5N1 avian influenza, which some studies suggest kills by 
causing an immune system overreaction called a cytokine storm. Floyd Frost of 
the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 
colleagues analyzed their institute&rsquo;s database of medical records from 
several health maintenance organizations. They looked at incidence of influenza 
and pneumonia and of COPD, and then cross-checked to see which patients were 
also taking statins. &ldquo;This study found a dramatically reduced risk of 
death from COPD among statin users and a significantly reduced risk of death 
from influenza/pneumonia,&rdquo; the researchers wrote in their report, 
published in the journal<i>Chest</i>. </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;These findings suggest that moderate-dose statin use reduces the 
risk of influenza/pneumonia death and strongly suggest that statins reduce the 
risk of COPD death.&rdquo; In 2006, researchers in Canada reported that statins 
act against sepsis, a dangerous blood infection, and a 2005 study found the 
death rate was 64 percent lower in pneumonia patients who had been taking 
statins.&ldquo;Even if statins are not able to significantly reduce the risk of 
death from avian influenza, their use could significantly extend the time 
between disease onset and death,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;This additional 
survival time could increase the effectiveness of anti-influenza drugs, 
providing a longer time to reduce mortality risks.&rdquo; (Reuters)</p>

<p><b> Proportion of Americans who are severely obese<br>
 rising faster than 
those who are moderately obese</b></p> 
<p>The proportion of Americans who are severely obese, about 100 pounds or 
more overweight, increased by 50 percent from 2000 to 2005, twice as fast as 
the growth seen in moderate obesity, according to a RAND Corporation study 
issued today. &ldquo;The proportion of people at the high end of the weight 
scale continues to increase at a brisk rate despite increased public attention 
on the risks of obesity and the increased use of drastic weight loss strategies 
such as bariatric surgery,&rdquo; said Roland Sturm, author of the report and 
an economist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. The findings will be 
published later this year in the journal<i>Public Health</i>. To be classified 
as severely obese, a person must have a body mass index of 40 or higher, 
roughly 100 pounds or more overweight for an average adult man. People with a 
BMI of 25 to 29 are considered overweight, while a BMI of 30 or more classifies 
a person as being obese. Sturm found that from 2000 to 2005, the proportion of 
Americans with a BMI of 30 or more increased by 24 percent, the proportion of 
people with a BMI of 40 or more increased by 50 percent and the proportion of 
Americans with a BMI of 50 or more increased by 75 percent. The heaviest groups 
have been increasing at the fastest rates for the past 20 years.</p> 
<p>The RAND Health study found that based on self-reported height and weight, 
which tends to understate actual BMI, 3 percent of Americans are already 
severely obese. Since that is the fastest growing group of obese Americans, 
widely published trends for obesity underestimate the consequences of the 
obesity epidemic because illness and service use are much higher among severely 
obese individuals. Among middle-aged adults, people with a BMI over 40 are 
expected to have health costs that are double those experienced by normal 
weight peers, while moderate obesity (a BMI of 30-35) is associated with only a 
25 percent increase.</p> 
<p>The prevalence of severe obesity continues to surge despite a rapid 
increase in the use of bariatric procedures. The number of bariatric surgeries 
increased from an estimated 13,000 in 1998 to more than 100,000 in 2003. 
Experts estimate that as many as 200,000 of the procedures were performed in 
2006. &ldquo;The explosion in the use of bariatric surgery has made no 
noticeable dent in the trend of morbid obesity,&rdquo; Sturm said. Sturm said 
the latest findings challenge a common belief held by physicians that people 
who are obese are a fixed proportion of the population and are not affected by 
changes in eating and physical activity patterns in the general population. The 
study suggests that clinically severe obesity, instead of being a rare 
pathological condition among genetically vulnerable individuals, is an integral 
part of the population&rsquo;s weight distribution. As the whole population 
becomes heavier, the extreme category, the severely obese, increases the 
fastest. &nbsp;</p>

New Canadian guidelines to address growing obesity epidemic</h1> 
<p>The first-ever Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on the 
Management and Prevention of Obesity in Adults and Children, published April 
10, 2007 in the<i> Canadian Medical Association Journal</i> (CMAJ), recommend 
that waist circumference be measured in all Canadian adults, and that a 
national surveillance system be developed that incorporates this measurement 
along with height and weight. Canada is the first country in the world to 
produce comprehensive evidence-based guidelines to address the management and 
prevention of overweight and obesity in adults and children. These are also 
important guidelines for health professionals and policy-makers to help them 
address Canada&rsquo;s increasing prevalence rates. The guidelines were 
developed by a panel of experts from across Canada, who identified a need for a 
comprehensive set of clinical guidelines to provide healthcare practitioners 
with a toolkit to manage and treat overweight and obese patients, as well as 
those who have a high waist circumference. Furthermore, the panel identified 
gaps in existing knowledge, and new research requirements needed to help 
develop a greater understanding of weight and body shape and their link to 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p> 
<p>The recommendation for measuring the waist circumference of all adults is 
the result of the latest research indicating that fat in the abdominal area is 
linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The 
guidelines reference the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cut-off points 
for waist circumference, given that these measures better reflect the ethnic 
diversity of Canada. Using IDF criteria, over 50% of Canadians are considered 
abdominally obese. The guidelines also recommend that: First-line treatment for 
overweight and obese adults should consist of diet changes and regular 
exercise, supported by behavior change; if unsuccessful, treatment with 
medications or bariatric surgery should be considered; Starting at 10 years of 
age, overweight or obese Canadians should undergo screening that would include 
tests measuring levels of fasting glucose, HDL (the good) and LDL (the bad) 
cholesterol, and triglycerides (a form of fat in the blood) levels. 
Furthermore, they should be monitored at regular intervals; Patients 
participating in weight management programs should be provided with education 
and support in behavior modification techniques as an add-on to other lifestyle 
modifications; Programs to promote healthy, active living and to prevent 
overweight and obesity should be implemented in schools to reduce the risk of 
childhood obesity; these include interventions to increase daily physical 
activity through physical education class-time and opportunities for active 
recreation; &ldquo;Screen time&rdquo; (e.g. television watching, and video or 
computer games) should be limited to less than two hours per day to encourage 
increased activity and less food consumption, and to limit exposure to food 
advertising. </p>

<p> FDA provides Web access to information on post-approval device studies</p> 
<p> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unveiled a new Web page that 
will keep the public informed about the status of post-approval patient studies 
for certain recently approved medical devices. &ldquo;Electronic access will 
give the public an opportunity to see progress being made on a company&rsquo;s 
post-market commitments,&rdquo; said Daniel Schultz, M.D., director of 
FDA&rsquo;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Modern devices provide 
significant health benefits, but experience has shown that the full magnitude 
of some potential risks doesn&rsquo;t always emerge during the mandatory 
clinical trials that are required for approval. FDA sometimes orders 
post-approval studies to address remaining issues such as the product's 
performance once it becomes more widely available or is used over a longer 
period of time. Generally, companies must submit interim post-approval study 
status reports every six months for the first two years of the study and 
annually thereafter until the final report has been submitted.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> FDA&rsquo;s new Web page includes information on all post-approval device 
studies ordered by FDA since Jan. 1, 2005. Each listing includes the 
company&rsquo;s name, the product&rsquo;s name, the approval number and date, 
and describes the study and whether it is meeting its reporting deadlines. No 
information on clinical data is available because the studies may be ongoing 
and include personal and confidential information. There are currently more 
than 40 listings on the Web page. The Institute of Medicine called for public 
reporting of post-market studies in a 2005 study on pediatric devices. That 
same year, FDA initiated an internal review of its ability to monitor 
post-approval studies. As a result, the agency shifted responsibility for 
tracking these studies from its pre-market staff to its post-market staff and 
set up a new electronic system for them to do so.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> FDA is currently implementing an ambitious action plan drawn up last year 
by a Post-market Device Transformation Leadership Team, a group of experts 
drawn from both inside and outside of FDA.&nbsp;Their action items included: 
pursuing the development of a unique identifier system to identify a device and 
the information associated with that device throughout its lifetime, mandatory 
use of electronic reporting for required adverse event reports and revising the 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health's current system of adverse event 
reporting. The new Web page is available at THIS LINK. For more information on

<b>Small steps lead to healthier hearts for women</b></p> 
<p>For years, doctors have been fighting the perception that heart disease is 
a mainly male affliction. But, in fact, cardiovascular disease is the number 
one killer of both men and women in the United States, according to the 
National Institutes of Health. Two of every five women who die are taken by 
heart disease or stroke, more than from all forms of cancer combined. Now, 
health officials are broadening their push to educate more women about their 
heart risks. The renewed campaign follows an American Heart Association study, 
initially done in 1997, that found that only 30 percent of women were aware 
that heart disease and stroke were their greatest health threats. A follow-up 
survey released last year found that number had climbed to 55 percent. 
&ldquo;The problem I see is that, yes, women are much more knowledgeable, but 
they aren&rsquo;t translating that knowledge into action,&rdquo; said Dr. 
Jennifer Mieres, director of nuclear cardiology and associate professor of 
clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine, and a national 
spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.</p> 
<p>The heart association continues to push its &ldquo;Go Red for Women&rdquo; 
campaign, which includes an online self-survey to evaluate an individual 
woman&rsquo;s specific risk factors. &ldquo;That way, women can increase their 
thought process about their risk factors,&rdquo; said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a 
cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at New York University, and 
medical director of the university&rsquo;s Women's Heart Program. A big part of 
the problem is that women often don&rsquo;t experience a heart attack the same 
way men do. &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s symptoms can be more subtle,&rdquo; Goldberg 
said. &ldquo;It can be shortness of breath without any chest pain. Some 
suddenly feel very exhausted with minimal activity. Pain often is felt lower in 
the chest and mistaken for a stomach problem.&rdquo; Because the symptoms are 
less obvious, women often wait too long to get treatment. &ldquo;If you look at 
statistics of women who&rsquo;ve died suddenly of heart attack, two-thirds died 
before they could reach the hospital,&rdquo; Goldberg said.</p> 
<p> Heart disease also often takes place in women differently than it does in 
men, Goldberg added. In men, plaque forms on the walls of blood vessels in 
specific places, eventually causing a &ldquo;kink&rdquo; in the vessel that 
stops blood flow. To treat it, doctors implant a stent at the point of 
blockage, which reopens the blood vessel. But as many as 30 percent of women 
suffer from micro-vascular coronary disease, Goldberg said. The plaque 
distributes more evenly throughout the blood vessels, slowing blood flow 
without creating a flow-stopping kink. In those cases, arteries have difficulty 
dilating during exercise or exertion, causing extreme fatigue in women. 
&ldquo;When women go to have an angiogram, there have been situations where 
doctors don&rsquo;t see any blockages, even though the patient has symptoms and 
a bad stress test,&rdquo; she said. Since there&rsquo;s no specific blockage, 
treating micro-vascular coronary disease is much harder. &ldquo;When doctors go 
in to look, there are no kinks, so they can&rsquo;t be stented,&rdquo; Goldberg 
said. &ldquo;Women are given drugs to thin the blood and take care of symptoms, 
as well as reduce cholesterol levels.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Since heart disease is often harder to detect and harder to treat in 
women, prevention is the key to saving most women's lives. Women need to take a 
hard look at their risk factors, Mieres and Goldberg said. &ldquo;If they 
can&rsquo;t recite their cholesterol levels or blood pressure, they need to 
schedule a visit with their doctor because that shows those probably 
haven&rsquo;t been checked in a while,&rdquo; Goldberg said. Women also should 
consider whether or not a relative has had heart disease. There is a genetic 
risk involved, and family members often share the same lifestyle risks, such as 
drinking, smoking or eating unhealthy foods. Once that risk is known, women can 
take steps to improve their health, Mieres said. Mieres recommends taking small 
steps that lead to big ones, walking 10 minutes a day and increasing that to 30 
minutes, or eating an apple for a snack instead of a candy bar. &ldquo;Doctors 
want women to realize that simple steps can make a world of difference in terms 
of your heart health,&rdquo; said Mieres. (HealthDay News) For more information

<b> China alters organ transplant laws</b></p> 
<p> China published new rules governing human organ transplants in its latest 
effort to clean up a business critics say has little regard for medical ethics. 
But the regulations were packed with shortcomings, a human rights group said 
Saturday, including a failure to address what it called the &ldquo;crucial 
issue&rdquo; of the procurement of organs from executed prisoners. The rules 
issued Friday by China&rsquo;s State Council, or Cabinet, include a ban on the 
sale of human organs for profit and on donations by people under 18, according 
to the text of the regulations published by the Communist Party newspaper 
People&rsquo;s Daily. The regulations, which take effect May 1, are also meant 
to standardize transplant procedures at the limited number of hospitals 
licensed to perform them.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Little information about China&rsquo;s lucrative transplant business is 
publicly available. Human rights groups have said many organs, including those 
transplanted into wealthy foreigners, come from executed prisoners who may not 
have given their permission. Human Rights Watch urged Beijing for full 
transparency on the removal of body organs from executed prisoners. Health 
officials say China faces a severe shortage of human organs, estimating that 
out of 1.5 million people who need transplants in China each year, only about 
10,000 operations are carried out. Voluntary donations remain far below demand 
in China, partly due to cultural biases against organ removal before burial.

<h2> <br>
FDA announces that companies must stop marketing suppository 
products containing trimethobenzamide</h2> 
<p> <br>
 As part of the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) on-going 
initiative to ensure that all marketed U.S. drugs have required marketing 
approval, the agency announced that companies must stop manufacturing and 
distributing unapproved suppository drug products containing trimethobenzamide 
hydrochloride. These products are used to treat nausea and vomiting in adults 
and children. Drugs containing trimethobenzamide in suppository form lack 
evidence of effectiveness. These products have been marketed under various 
names, including Tigan, Tebamide, T-Gen, Trimazide, and Trimethobenz. FDA urges 
consumers who are using suppositories containing trimethobenzamide, and who 
have questions or concerns, to contact their healthcare provider. There are 
many alternative products approved to effectively treat nausea and vomiting, 
and that are available in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, 
solutions, injectables and suppositories. Several oral capsules and injectable 
products containing trimethobenzamide have been approved by FDA and are not 
affected by today&rsquo;s action.</p> 
<p> <br>
 The Federal Register notice which outlines the agency&rsquo;s order 
to manufacturers and distributors, also concludes all outstanding issues for 
drugs containing trimethobenzamide, under the Drug Efficacy Study 
Implementation program (DESI). Under DESI, FDA evaluated the evidence of 
effectiveness for thousands of drug products previously approved for safety 
only, including those products marketed under the name of Tigan containing 
trimethobenzamide. Because DESI findings apply to any unapproved products that 
are identical, related, or similar to DESI-reviewed drugs, today&rsquo;s notice 
makes the marketing of any unapproved trimethobenzamide hydrochloride 
suppository products unlawful. Companies manufacturing or marketing 
trimethobenzamide hydrochloride suppository products must cease shipping them 
in interstate commerce by May 9, 2007. Any company wishing to market a product 
containing trimethobenzamide in suppository form must now obtain an approved 
new drug application prior to marketing. For more information seeTHIS LINK. </p>

FDA licenses first biologic product to prevent Hepatitis B 
reinfection in liver transplant patients</h2> 
<p> <br>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval 
of HepaGam B for the prevention of hepatitis B reinfection in certain liver 
transplant patients. HepaGam B is the first product of its kind (an immune 
globulin product) approved for this purpose. Hepatitis B is a serious disease 
caused by a virus that attacks the liver and can cause lifelong infection, 
liver cancer, liver failure and death. Liver transplant patients who have 
already been exposed to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at an increased risk of 
reinfection because they have weakened immune systems. &ldquo;This approval 
provides a new treatment option for the reduction of hepatitis B recurrence in 
liver transplant patients with a prior history of this serious disease,&rdquo; 
said Jesse Goodman, M.D., M.P.H., director of FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research. &ldquo;It is the first immune globulin product, one of 
several classes of proteins derived from human plasma, approved for this 
use.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
 HepaGam B works by providing an immediate immune response to the 
virus. This immunity protects patients previously exposed to HBV. Patients must 
receive injections at the time of their liver transplant and throughout their 
lives. This product is manufactured from human plasma collected at U.S. 
licensed plasma centers from healthy donors. FDA based its approval on the 
company's clinical data in a study of HBV-infected persons undergoing full 
liver transplants, which showed a reduction in the virus recurrence rate from 
86 percent to about 13 percent. Adverse reactions were similar to other immune 
globulin products for other indications and included headache and hypertension. 
In January 2006, FDA licensed HepaGam B to prevent infection with HBV for the 
following other purposes: after acute exposure to blood or certain body fluids 
containing HBV; perinatal exposure of infants to mothers previously exposed to 
HBV; sexual exposure to persons previously exposed to HBV; and household 
exposure to persons with acute HBV infection. HepaGam B is manufactured by 
Cangene Corp. of Winnipeg, Canada.</p>

<p> <br>
 Patient Care Technology Systems (PCTS) announced that Lehigh Valley 
Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN) has selected <i> Amelior ORTracker </i>
automatic tracking software to improve the efficiency of surgical care 
throughout its perioperative departments in all three hospitals within LVHHN. 
The tracking system will encompass patient flow throughout the Surgical Staging 
Units, the Operating Rooms and Post Anesthesia Care Units. The automatic 
tracking software provides real-time tracking of patients and mobile medical 
devices using wireless ultra-wideband badges worn by patients and attached to 
equipment. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In addition to locating and tracking Operating Room resources, the 
software translates interactions between patients, medical staff and equipment 
into time-stamped stages of a patient&rsquo;s course of treatment. This 
information is continuously updated on an electronic tracking map to inform 
caregivers of anticipated demand as patients are prepared for surgery and later 
for recovery.&nbsp;The software organizes and enhances communications between 
caregivers regarding the status of patients, rooms, and the availability of 
clinical staff. As a result, phone calls and other manual interventions to 
manage care progression are reduced resulting in more timely care and a quieter 
patient environment. Extensive data on patient flow and resource utilization is 
generated through the software&rsquo;s reporting engine to assist perioperative 
departments to further analyze department utilization.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h1> New urgency in debating healthcare </h1> 
<p> <br>
 Since Hillary Rodham Clinton&rsquo;s effort to overhaul the 
nation&rsquo;s medical system was rejected in 1994, most big employers have 
stayed out of the debate on healthcare reform. But with their medical costs 
ballooning, top executives of large companies are starting to speak up again, 
and many are calling for a national approach to fixing healthcare. Few advocate 
a wholesale shift to government-directed medicine, but most are seeking broad 
changes in the employer-subsidized health system, which they regard as 
unsustainable in its current form. Business executives are motivated in large 
part by health insurance premiums that are rising much faster than inflation, 
adding to their costs at a time when many are facing more intense competition 
from abroad, where companies rely on government-supported healthcare systems 
largely financed by taxes.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> A 2006 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates found 
that premiums in the United States had risen about 87 percent since 2000. 
&ldquo;Five years from now this problem will have to be cured, or the 
competitiveness of the United States will be dramatically affected,&rdquo; said 
J. Randall MacDonald, senior vice president for human resources at I.B.M. But 
companies are by no means speaking with one voice. Everybody&rsquo;s problem, 
the growing cost of health coverage, can be felt differently depending on the 
size of a company and whether it has promised health benefits to retirees. 
Older companies, for example, are more likely to welcome government help on 
coverage for workers who leave before they are eligible for Medicare and may 
find they cannot afford insurance. But Silicon Valley technology companies that 
do not have or need retiree coverage are wary of new taxpayer-financed 
subsidies.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The healthcare debate is heating up as candidates polish their positions 
for next year&rsquo;s presidential primaries, and as Democrats in Congress 
assert their newfound power. In general, employers &ldquo;are more interested 
in reform today than at any time since the Clinton effort&rdquo; in the early 
1990s, said Robert S. Galvin, global healthcare and policy director at General 
Electric, which provides health benefits for 460,000 employees and dependents 
and 240,000 retirees and dependents. The surge of interest, Galvin said, 
&ldquo;is driven by compounding health cost increases at three times the 
general inflation rate, plus the entrance of Wal-Mart and other 
retailers&rdquo; that are beginning to feel the pain of out-of-control 
increases in costs. Many retailers, with large staffs of low-paid, temporary 
and part-time workers, would welcome a larger government role. (The New York

<p><b> Statins linked to lower risk of infection; Markedly lower frequency of 
sepsis in dialysis patients observed</b></p> 
<p> Researchers at Johns Hopkins may have discovered an unintended benefit in 
the drugs millions of Americans take to lower their cholesterol: The 
medications, all statins, seem to lower the risk of a potentially lethal blood 
infection known as sepsis in patients on kidney dialysis. The study is 
published in the current issue of the<i>Journal of the American Medical 
Association</i> (JAMA). Sepsis is the leading cause of death in non-coronary 
intensive care units in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control. It also poses serious risk for kidney patients undergoing 
regular dialysis treatments. The Hopkins researchers cautioned that kidney 
dialysis patients should not necessarily ask their doctors to put them on 
statins until more studies are done to verify their findings.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Building on earlier, limited studies that suggested risk reduction in 
animals and some people, Professor of Medicine, Director of the Welch Center 
and senior author Neil R. Powe, M.D., and his Johns Hopkins team followed 1041 
dialysis patients for 10 years, dividing the subjects into those taking statins 
and those not. &ldquo;Those taking statins had a 41 in a 1,000 chance of being 
hospitalized for sepsis, while the other group not taking statins had a 110 out 
of 1,000 risk. Although the overall absolute risk is relatively small, the 
statin group&rsquo;s risk is dramatically lower,&rdquo; says Rajesh Gupta M.D., 
the study&rsquo;s lead author, who was a senior medical resident at Hopkins 
when the study was conducted.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Gupta says it remains unclear why or how statins work this way, &ldquo;but 
the consistency of the findings with laboratory studies adds a lot of credence 
to the idea that statins are doing something substantial to reduce risk.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Statins are known to have an effect on the body&rsquo;s immune system, 
but what that is exactly, and how many statin users it affects, is still not 
widely understood.&rdquo; &nbsp;Statins may regulate the immune response to 
infection or fight microbes directly, Powe suspects. The study&rsquo;s authors 
also suppose that statins may work like penicillin, since the first statin was 
originally derived from a fungus which, it is theorized, secretes a statin as a 
way to starve other competing microorganisms that require cholesterol to 
survive. The study included patients from 81 dialysis clinics across 19 states. 
Only those enrollees who were admitted to the hospital with sepsis were 
counted, in order to rule out any subjects who became septic during an 
unrelated hospital stay. Only 14 percent of those initially enrolled in the 
study were on statins. Out of the 1,041 patients, there were a total of 303 
hospitalizations for sepsis.</p>

<p><b> Criteria for depression are too broad, researchers say</b><br>
<br>
 Up 
to 25 percent of people in whom psychiatrists would currently diagnose 
depression may only be reacting normally to stressful events such as a divorce 
or losing a job, according to a new analysis that reexamined how the standard 
diagnostic criteria are used. The finding could have far-reaching consequences 
for the diagnosis of depression, the growing use of symptom checklists to 
identify those who may be depressed, and the $12 billion-a-year U.S. market for 
antidepressant drugs. Diagnoses are currently made on the basis of a 
constellation of symptoms that include sadness, fatigue, insomnia and suicidal 
thoughts. The diagnostic manual used by doctors says that anyone who has at 
least five such symptoms for as little as two weeks may be clinically 
depressed. Only in the case of someone grieving over the death of a loved one 
is it normal for symptoms to last as long as two months, the manual says. The 
new study, however, found that extended periods of depression-like symptoms are 
common in people who have been through other life stresses such as a divorce or 
a natural disaster and that they do not necessarily constitute illness.</p> 
<p>The study also suggested that drug treatment may often be inappropriate for 
people who are experiencing painful, but normal, responses to life&rsquo;s 
stresses. Supportive therapy, on the other hand, may be useful, and may keep 
someone who has been through a divorce or has lost a job from going on to 
develop full-blown depression. The researchers, including Michael B. First of 
Columbia University, the editor of the authoritative diagnostic manual, based 
their findings on a national survey of 8,098 people. They found that those who 
had experienced a variety of stressful events frequently had prolonged periods 
in which they reported many symptoms of depression. Only a fraction, however, 
had severe symptoms that could be classified as clinical depression, the 
researchers said. An estimated one in six Americans suffer depression at some 
point in their lives. Under the more limited criteria the researchers urged, 
that number would be 25 percent lower. &ldquo;The cost of not looking at 
context is you think anyone who comes under this diagnosis has a biological 
disorder, so should more or less automatically get antidepressant medication, 
and everything else is superfluous,&rdquo; said lead author Jerome Wakefield, a 
New York University researcher. (Washington Post) </p>

<h2> Total shoulder replacements as safe as swapping out hips and knees</h2> 
<p> <br>
 Contrary to widespread belief, total surgical replacement of 
arthritic shoulder joints carries no greater risk of complications than 
replacement of other major joints, a Johns Hopkins study suggests. In fact, the 
Johns Hopkins researchers say, their study shows that patients who undergo 
shoulder arthroplasty to relieve chronic and significant pain can expect 
significantly fewer complications, much shorter hospital stays and less costs 
than patients undergoing hip or knee replacement.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Hopkins research team, led by Edward McFarland, M.D., director of the 
Division of Adult Orthopedics at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, analyzed anonymous 
patient information provided by the Maryland Health Services Cost Review 
Commission, the state&rsquo;s hospital rate-regulator. They looked at all 
arthroplasties performed in Maryland to alleviate osteoarthritis pain between 
1994 and 2001, including details of 15, 414 hip surgeries, 34, 471 knee 
operations and 625 shoulder procedures. &ldquo;After looking at how all these 
patients fared, we concluded that, comparatively, total shoulder surgery is 
just as safe and effective as other types of arthroplasties,&rdquo; said 
McFarland. &ldquo;Lower numbers of shoulder procedures done both regionally and 
nationally may indicate that many people live with shoulder pain because they 
fear that the corrective surgery is too risky or costs more than similar 
procedures. But we have found that this is just not true.&rdquo; The findings 
appeared in an online version of the journal<i>Clinical Orthopedics</i>. 
According to nationwide 2003 Medicare figures, 6,700 people had shoulder joints 
replaced that year, compared to 106,887 hip replacements and 199,195 total knee 
replacements.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Patients in the study who had shoulder surgery had far less in-hospital 
post-surgical complications (7.5 percent) compared with those patients who had 
their hips and knees replaced (15.5 percent and 14.7 percent, respectively). 
McFarland's team also determined that the average time a person remained 
hospitalized after the surgery was lowest for those recovering from shoulder 
procedures (just 2.42 days for shoulder patients, versus more than four days 
for both the hip and knee equivalents). Shoulder arthroplasty is also less 
expensive, according to McFarland. A shoulder replacement's total costs, on 
average, are $10, 351; whereas hip replacement surgery averages $15, 442, and 
knee arthroplasty, $14, 674. McFarland says most patients who are candidates 
for total shoulder replacement surgery are &ldquo;at the end of their 
rope&rdquo; trying to manage chronic pain and disability with drugs. 
&ldquo;Ninety-nine percent of the people who have a shoulder replacement for 
arthritis get pain relief and say that they wish they had done it 
sooner,&rdquo; said McFarland. &ldquo;This study indicates there may be little 
reason to wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>  Research shows Masimo Acoustic Respiratory Monitoring technology 
provides &ldquo;significantly more reliable monitoring of respiration 
rate&rdquo;</b></p> 
<p> Masimo reported that three new independent studies, including one 
presented the recent International Anesthesiology Research Society (IARS) 
Clinical &amp; Scientific Congress in Orlando, concluded that Masimo Acoustic 
Respiratory Monitoring technology (ARM) is &ldquo;at least as accurate as 
capnometry&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly more reliable&rdquo; for monitoring 
respiration in spontaneously breathing patients. Respiration is one of the five 
vital signs, but clinicians have long looked for a continuous and noninvasive 
method of monitoring respiration that is both clinically accurate, easy to use, 
and well tolerated by patients. Current methods of respiration monitoring, 
including impedance pneumography with ECG and end-tidal CO2 with capnometry, 
each have limitations that make them unreliable in certain clinical situations.
</p> 
<p> In the study released at the recent IARS, conducted by M. R. Macknet, MD 
and a team of researchers at Loma Linda University's Department of 
Anesthesiology, fifteen pediatric PACU patients were monitored with Masimo's 
ARM technology consisting of an adhesive bioacoustic sensor applied to the 
patient&rsquo;s neck and connected to a breathing frequency monitor prototype. 
In addition, a nasal cannula was placed, secured with tape, and connected to a 
capnometer. The study showed that &ldquo;premature cannula dislodgement 
occurred in 14 patients&rdquo; in less that 20 minutes, while &ldquo;in no 
patient was the bioacoustic sensor dislodged before the end of the stay in the 
PACU.&rdquo; &ldquo;This data shows the relative ease and high incidence of 
capnometer cannula dislodgement compared to the new bioacoustic sensor,&rdquo; 
the researchers commented. &ldquo;In clinical settings where continuous and 
reliable monitoring of spontaneous respiration is important, the new 
bioacoustic sensor provides significantly greater patient connection time, 
which should lead to significantly more reliable monitoring of respiration 
rate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> In two studies released in January at the 2007 Society for Technology in 
Anesthesiology annual meeting, researchers monitored ten postoperative adult 
ICU and six pediatric PACU patients in separate studies with Masimo&rsquo;s ARM 
technology as well as a nasal cannula connected to a capnometer. They concluded 
that Masimo&rsquo;s new bioacoustic respiratory sensor &ldquo;demonstrates 
accuracy for respiratory rate monitoring as good as capnometry&rdquo; and that 
the device &ldquo;offers multiple benefits over existing devices and has a 
potential to improve monitoring in a general care setting.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Masimo expects to combine its Masimo Rainbow SET Read-Through Motion and 
Low Perfusion pulse oximetry with Masimo ARM technology as part of a general 
floor monitoring solution designed to increase patient safety and heed the 
growing call to find ways reduce unnecessary deaths on general care floors. The 
combination of these two technologies will give hospitals a continuous and 
noninvasive way to accurately monitor a patient&rsquo;s oxygenation and 
ventilation during patient-controlled analgesia, consistent with the new 
recommendations from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF). In 
addition, the combination of Masimo Rainbow SET pulse oximetry and Masimo ARM 
should assist hospitals in being compliant with new American Society of 
Anesthesia (ASA) guidelines for management of patients at risk of obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) by providing an accurate and reliable combination of oxygen 
saturation and respiration rate monitoring. The technology is currently 
undergoing additional clinical and engineering testing and is expected to be 
introduced at Alpha Sites in late 2007. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p> Four numbers on a piece of paper may not mean much to you, but for LeeSar 
the Supply Chain Company for Lee Memorial Health System and Sarasota Memorial 
Health System (FL) it means a lot. For the past two years LeeSar has been 
trying to receive a license from the State of Florida Department of Public 
Health to operate a pharmaceutical repackaging facility. Although the health 
system would save money repackaging this product from direct bulk shipments, 
that was not the total reason this license was so important. So when LeeSar 
received notice that its new repackaging facility had passed inspection and 
then received its license with its four figured license number the excitement 
was that we could now free up our pharmacists to work on the patient floors 
with the doctors and nurses on medication management and by doing so insure the 
highest quality of patient care to our community. The repackaging operation is 
now moving into its operational phase and registering all medications it will 
repackage with the state. For further information you can contact; Bob Simpson,

<h1> Study questions exam to detect breast cancer </h1> 
<p> <br>
 A highly promoted and widely used computerized system for examining 
mammograms is leading to less accuracy, not more, a new study finds. The 
system, known as computer-aided detection, or CAD, did not find more breast 
cancer, researchers are reporting today. But it did lead to many more false 
alarms that resulted in additional testing and biopsies for spots on mammograms 
that turned out to be harmless. Such detection systems, approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration in 1998, are sold by several companies, including 
Hologic of Bedford, MA; iCAD of Nashua, NH; and Kodak. According to the 
National Cancer Institute, the systems are now being used in about 30 percent 
of mammography centers. The equipment is expensive, costing $50,000 to 
$175,000, but Medicare, assuming it would improve the outcome, pays an extra 
$20 for each mammogram read with it. That made it profitable for large centers 
to use it. Doctors also worried about lawsuits if they were not using it and 
missed a cancer. But all along, as more and more mammography centers bought the 
software, the assumption was that the computer would find cancers that 
radiologists would miss, saving women&rsquo;s lives.</p> 
<p> The new findings are likely to surprise radiologists, said Dr. Ferris M. 
Hall, a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Hall wrote an 
editorial accompanying the paper, which was published today in<i>The New 
England Journal of Medicine</i>. But executives at the company whose equipment 
was used in the study, Hologic, said they interpreted the results differently. 
If there is a suspicious spot on a mammogram, women will want to have a biopsy 
to rule out invasive cancer, said Robert A. Cascella, the company&rsquo;s 
president and chief operating officer. And the study showed that computer-aided 
detection was finding proportionately more very early precancerous growths. 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a valuable finding,&rdquo; he said. The company has 
improved its software since the study was conducted, Cascella added. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Joshua J. Fenton of the University of 
California, Davis, emphasized that women should continue to have mammograms. 
But, Dr. Fenton said, they may want to ask if their mammography center uses 
computer-aided detection. His study, he said, &ldquo;does raise concerns that 
technology is causing harm without clear benefit.&rdquo; New technology, like 
computer-aided detection, digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging and 
ultrasound, can be so sensitive that doctors have trouble deciding which 
findings are worrisome. The only screening method that has been rigorously 
evaluated is old-fashioned X-ray film mammograms, but it is likely to be 
replaced by something, or some combination of things, whose benefits and risks 
are largely unknown. &ldquo;We are getting ourselves out on thinner and thinner 
ice,&rdquo; said Dr. Suzanne W. Fletcher, an emerita professor of ambulatory 
care and prevention at Harvard Medical School. &ldquo;With mammography, we have 
multiple studies showing what happens to mortality rates if you get this versus 
if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Fletcher said. &ldquo;With these newer 
technologies, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The new study of computer-aided detection was an analysis of 429,345 
mammograms obtained from 1998 to 2002 at 43 mammography centers. During that 
time, seven of the centers switched to computer-aided detection. That enabled 
the investigators to compare results with and without computer software to help 
radiologists find suspicious spots. Computer-aided detection, the researchers 
wrote, &ldquo;was associated with significantly higher false positive rates, 
recall rates, and biopsy rates and with significantly lower overall 
accuracy.&rdquo; With computer-aided detection, 31 percent more women were 
called in for additional tests and 20 percent more had biopsies. (The New York

<h1> Ibuprofen may boost chance of heart problems in high risk patients with 
osteoarthritis</h1> 
<p>The common painkiller, ibuprofen, may boost the likelihood of heart 
problems in high risk patients who have osteoarthritis, suggests research 
published ahead of print in the<i>Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases</i>. 
Previous studies have suggested that ibuprofen interferes with the effects of 
aspirin. The research team compared the cardiovascular health over one year of 
more than 18,000 patients aged over 50 with osteoarthritis. The patients were 
taking part in the Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event 
Trial (TARGET). They were taking either high dose (400 mg a day) lumiracoxib, a 
type of drug known as a cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) inhibitor, or ibuprofen (800 mg 
three times a day), or naproxen (500 mg twice daily), both of which are 
traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). One in 10 were 
considered to be at high risk of a heart attack or stroke, some of whom also 
took low dose aspirin (70 to 100 mg a day). Some 623 patients were taking 
ibuprofen, just over half of whom (57%) were also taking low dose aspirin.</p> 
<p>The results showed that there was no difference in the total number of 
heart attacks and strokes among participants at low risk of cardiovascular 
disease, irrespective of their drug treatment. But this was not true of those 
at high risk. High risk patients taking aspirin and ibuprofen were around nine 
times as likely to have heart attacks and strokes over one year as those on 
lumiracoxib. This is the first analysis of trial data to show an increased risk 
for ibuprofen, say the authors. &nbsp;Among high risk patients not taking 
aspirin, the rate of heart attacks or strokes was higher for those on the COX 
-2 inhibitor than it was for those on naproxen, but no higher than for those on 
ibuprofen. Participants taking ibuprofen also developed congestive heart 
failure more often than those on the COX inhibitor. Most patients given COX-2 
inhibitors and NSAIDs are elderly, and evidence to date suggests that both drug 
types boost the chances of heart attack and stroke. But the authors say that 
their findings suggest that ibuprofen interferes with the blood thinning 
properties of aspirin in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p><b> Scientists spot mutation linked to birth defects</b></p> 
<p> Canadian researchers say they have found the first genetic mutation 
clearly linked to neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida in humans. 
&ldquo;We have identified the mutations in a few patients with neural tube 
defects,&rdquo; said Philippe Gros, professor of biochemistry at McGill 
University in Montreal. &ldquo;There are a total of 10 patients where we found 
the mutations. It is a very small number, but this is the first time that it 
has been pinned down.&rdquo; The gene, designated VANGL1, codes for a protein 
that enables cells to orient themselves properly during development, Gros 
explained. A mutation causes cells to lose their orientation, so the tissue in 
which it is expressed fails to develop properly, causing gaps that leave nerve 
tissue exposed. Gros&rsquo;s group first identified the mutation in mice. Now, 
reporting in the April 5 issue of the<i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, 
they say they have found three VANGL1 mutations linked to neural tube defects 
in children treated at birth defect centers in Italy and France.</p> 
<p> &rdquo;There have been many association studies, some risk factors 
identified in certain genes, alterations in some genes associated with neural 
tube defects, but there hasn&rsquo;t been any clearly causative 
mutation,&rdquo; Gros said. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been any situation like 
this, where you knock out the gene and find a neural defect in the mouse and 
then find the same thing in humans.&rdquo; Yet VANGL1 is just one part of a 
large picture of neural tube defect causation, he said. &ldquo;It is clearly a 
multigene situation, where alterations in more than one gene are responsible 
for the effect,&rdquo; Gros said. &ldquo;This is a very important finding that 
associates defects in this gene with neural tube defects in these specific 
families,&rdquo; said Marcy C. Speer, director of the Duke University Center 
for Human Genetics in Durham, NC. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> As far as medical practice is concerned, &ldquo;for therapy, we are not 
sure that it will have a great impact at this time,&rdquo; Gros said. 
Scientifically, the discovery is fascinating, because the gene is found 
throughout the animal world, conserved all the way from flies to humans,&rdquo; 
he said. The next step in the McGill research will be to investigate other 
proteins in which VANGL1 plays a role, to further pin down its mode of action, 
Gros said. (HealthDay News)</p>

<h1>Effect of hormone therapy on risk of heart disease may vary by age and 
years since menopause</h1> 
<p>Secondary analyses of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative 
(WHI) suggest that women who begin hormone therapy within 10 years of menopause 
may have less risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to hormone therapy than 
women farther from menopause. Overall, hormone therapy did not reduce the risk 
of CHD. However, the farther a woman was from the onset of menopause when she 
began hormone therapy, the greater her risk of CHD due to hormone therapy 
appeared to be. Although these findings did not meet statistical significance, 
they suggest that the health consequences of hormone therapy may vary by time 
from menopause.</p> 
<p>These findings are consistent with the primary publications from the WHI 
trials of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone (total of 27,347 
participants) in showing no overall benefit for CHD, and in suggesting that 
risk due to hormones may differ depending on age or years since menopause. 
&ldquo;Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease by Age 
and Years Since Menopause,&rdquo; will be published in the April 4 issue of the
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. In a secondary analysis, 
scientists reanalyze previously collected data and findings in an effort to 
clarify or ask new questions. In the case of this latest WHI analysis, the 
authors combined the data from the two trials to explore in more detail the 
previously observed trends in hormone effects by distance from the menopause. 
Differences in hormone therapy effects were examined in three age categories 
(50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 79) or in years since the onset of menopause 
(less than 10, 10 to 19, and 20 or more). The Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative 
and the newly published analyses are funded by the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.</p> 
<p>The analyses also suggest that the increased risk in heart disease due to 
hormone therapy in older women is primarily in those who also have hot flashes 
and night sweats. Study participants who had these symptoms were more likely to 
have risk factors for CHD such as high blood pressure or high blood 
cholesterol, but it was not clear whether this explained their higher risk on 
hormone therapy. Other results from the analyses of the combined trials 
include: Confirmation that hormone therapy increases the risk of stroke and 
this risk does not appear to be influenced by age or time since menopause; Even 
in women within 10 years of menopause, there appears to be an increased risk of 
breast cancer in women taking estrogen with a progestin; There was a trend (not 
statistically significant) towards reduced risk for death associated with 
hormone use in younger compared to older women. </p>

<p><b> Medicare announces measure specifications for the Physician Quality 
Reporting Initiative</b> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the posting 
of detailed specifications for the 74 measures included in the 2007 Physician 
Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). PQRI establishes a financial incentive for 
physicians and other health practitioners to participate in a voluntary quality 
reporting program.&nbsp;Eligible professionals who successfully report data for 
a designated set of quality measures may earn a bonus payment, subject to a 
cap, of 1.5 percent of total allowed charges for covered Medicare physician fee 
schedule services provided during the reporting period of July 1, 2007 to 
December 31, 2007. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The 2007 PQRI quality measures relate to important processes of care that 
are linked to improved healthcare quality outcomes.&nbsp;They are evidence- and 
consensus-based measures that reflect the work of national organizations 
involved in quality measure development, consensus endorsement, and adoption. 
The specifications have been posted well in advance of the statutory deadline 
of July 1, 2007.&nbsp;This is to help eligible professionals to identify 
measures applicable to their practices and to prepare for submission of quality 
data in advance of the July 1, 2007 start date of the program. CMS anticipates 
a small number of additional specification changes, which may expand the 
applicability of the measures to additional eligible professionals. The PQRI

<h1>Vaccine helps prevent ear infections&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>&nbsp;</h1> 
<h1>A new study found that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) 
moderately lowered the incidence of middle ear infections and reduced the need 
for pressure-equalizing ear tubes, a common surgical treatment for recurrent 
infections. &ldquo;Children prone to recurrent ear infections benefit from the 
vaccine,&rdquo; said lead study author Katherine A. Poehling, an assistant 
professor of pediatrics at Monroe Carrell Jr. Children&rsquo;s Hospital at 
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. But do not expect this scourge of 
childhood, which affects more than 80 percent of children under age three and 
costs $5 billion to treat each year, to go the way of whooping cough anytime 
soon. The reason: PCV7 prevents only a fraction of the infections that cause it.
<br> <br>
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
the vaccine combats the seven most common strains of pneumococcal bacteria 
behind otitis media (middle ear infection). But pneumococcal bacteria cause 
only 30 to 55 percent of such infections; other classes of bacteria cause the 
rest. The PCV7 vaccine has been part of the routine immunization schedule for 
infants in the U.S. since 2000. It was developed to prevent meningitis, 
invasive pneumonia and other potentially deadly diseases. It is given to 
infants in four doses: at two, four, six and 12 to 15 months. The findings, 
published in the April issue of<i> Pediatrics</i> are the first to document the 
long-term effects of the vaccine on middle ear infections. Study co-author J. 
Pekka Nuorti, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for 
Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, estimates that the PCV7 vaccine prevents 
two million cases of otitis media in children under two years of age in the 
U.S. annually.<br>
<br>
 &rdquo;Studies show that the number of middle ear 
infections caused by the pneumococcus serotypes in the vaccine have declined 
dramatically, but others have increased by 30 percent,&rdquo; Nuorti said. 
Bacteria on the rise may be filling the ecological void left by the decline in 
the vaccine&rsquo;s seven pneumococcus strains. But, he adds, two vaccines in 
the pipeline would cover more pneumococcal strains, including those whose rates 
of occurrence are escalating. &ldquo;Parents shouldn&rsquo;t think that just 
because their kids are getting vaccinated that they won&rsquo;t get otitis 
media,&rdquo; said Richard Rosenfeld, director of otolaryngology at Long Island 
College Hospital in New York City. &ldquo;Seventy percent to 80 percent of the 
tendency to get otitis media is genetic. Beyond that are a host of factors, 
including smoking in the household, attending day care and breast-feeding for 
the first three months of life&hellip;. The vaccine alters that equation, but 
the effect isn&rsquo;t dramatic.&rdquo; (Scientific American) &nbsp; </h1>

<h1><i> </i><b> WHO proposes global agenda on transplantation</b></h1> 
<p> This week, at the second Global Consultation on Transplantation the World 
Health Organization (WHO) presented countries and other stakeholders with a 
blueprint for updated global guiding principles on cell, tissue and organ 
donation and transplantation. Those principles aim to address a number of 
problems: the global shortage of human materials, particularly organs, for 
transplantation; the growing phenomenon of &lsquo;transplant tourism&rsquo; 
partly caused by that shortage; quality, safety and efficacy issues related to 
transplantation procedures; traceability and accountability of human materials 
crossing borders. Stakeholders agreed to the creation of a Global Forum on 
Transplantation to be spearheaded by WHO, to assist and support developing 
countries initiating transplantation programs and to work towards a unified 
global coding system for cells, tissues and organs.</p> 
<p> A central theme of the discussions was WHO&rsquo;s concern over increasing 
cases of commercial exploitation of human materials. &ldquo;Non-existent or lax 
laws on organ donation and transplantation encourage commercialism and 
transplant tourism,&rdquo; said Dr. Luc Noel, in charge of transplantation at 
WHO. &ldquo;If all countries agree on a common approach, and stop commercial 
exploitation, then access will be more equitable and we will have fewer health 
tragedies.&rdquo; Recent estimates communicated to WHO by 98 countries show 
that the most sought after organ is the kidney. Sixty-six thousand kidneys were 
transplanted in 2005 representing a mere 10% of the estimated need. In the same 
year, 21,000 livers and 6,000 hearts were transplanted. Both kidney and liver 
transplants are on the rise but demand is also increasing and remains 
unmatched. Reports on &lsquo;transplant tourism&rsquo; show that it makes up an 
estimated 10% of global transplantation practices. The phenomenon has been 
increasing since the mid-1990's, coinciding with greater acceptance of the 
therapeutic benefits of transplantation and with progress in the efficacy of 
the medicines, immuno-suppressants, used to prevent the body&rsquo;s rejection 
of a transplanted organ.</p> 
<p> The principles put forward by WHO underscore that the person, whether 
recipient of an organ or a donor, must be the main concern both as patient and 
as human being; that commercial exploitation of organs denies equitable access 
and can be harmful to both donors and recipients; that organ donation from live 
donors poses numerous health risks which can be avoided by promoting donation 
from deceased donors; and that quality, safety, efficacy and transparency are 
essential if society is to reap the benefits transplantation can offer as a 
therapy. &ldquo;Live donations are not without risk, whether the organ is paid 
for or not. The donor must receive proper medical follow-up but this is often 
lacking when he or she is seen as a means to making a profit,&rdquo; added Dr. 
Noel. &ldquo;Donations from deceased persons eliminate the problem of donor 
safety and can help reduce organ trafficking.&rdquo; WHO action on 
transplantation will be aided by a global observatory set up in Madrid under 
the auspices of the Government of Spain. The observatory, which is linked to 
the WHO Global Knowledge Base, will provide an interface for health authorities 
and the general public to access data on donation and transplantation 
practices, legal frameworks and obstacles to equitable access.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> States revising organ-donation law; critics fear measure may not go far 
enough to protect donors</b></p> 
<p> State legislatures are rewriting legislation governing organ donations in 
one of the most ambitious initiatives in at least 20 years to alleviate the 
chronic shortage of kidneys, livers and other body parts, an effort that some 
doctors and ethicists fear tilts too far toward allowing organs to be taken. 
Virginia, Idaho, Utah and South Dakota have already adopted a model law 
designed to make organ donation easier by clarifying a host of sensitive 
questions. An especially tricky one is how to handle unconscious patients who 
signed donor cards but also specified that they did not want to kept alive on 
life-support. Another one is what doctors should do when the family of a dying 
person who agreed to be a donor objects to surgeons taking their loved 
one&rsquo;s organs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The measure awaits the signatures of the governors of Arkansas, Indiana, 
Iowa and New Mexico. At least 17 other states, plus the District and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, are considering the legislation. Supporters hope it is adopted 
nationwide. While praised by transplant advocates, the model law has stirred 
concern among some doctors and bioethicists. Critics say it could result in 
people becoming donors or kept on life support against their or their 
family&rsquo;s wishes. And some worry that the measure could make doctors more 
hesitant about administering morphine and other drugs to make dying patients 
comfortable, for fear of rendering their organs useless for transplantation. 
The revised model law is the latest in a series of initiatives by transplant 
advocates to boost the number of organs available for the more than 95,000 
Americans on waiting lists. Organ banks have also been aggressively promoting a 
controversial practice that allows surgeons to take organs from patients who 
are not brain dead, more than doubling the number of such donations in the past 
three years. &ldquo;There are lots of efforts to bridge the growing gap between 
demand and supply,&rdquo; said Arthur L. Caplan, a University of Pennsylvania 
bioethicist. &ldquo;We have to be very careful that we don&rsquo;t make people 
think that we don&rsquo;t have their best interests in mind and are just going 
to use them to get their body parts.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The model law, the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, updates 1968 
legislation adopted by every state to make organ donation procedures uniform 
nationwide. Among many changes, the measure expands the list of people who can 
consent to an unconscious patient becoming a donor, and makes it clear that a 
person&rsquo;s decision to be an organ donor cannot be revoked by anyone else. 
The most controversial section deals with unconscious patients who have signed 
donor cards but also &ldquo;living wills&rdquo; or other documents that state 
that they do not want a ventilator or other medical care to keep them alive, 
which is sometimes necessary to maintain organ viability until a transplant can 
take place. Under the act, the donor card trumps the living will, which 
triggered objections from some bioethicists and doctors who care for critically 
ill patients. In response, the commission sent states substitute language that 
calls for family members or others to be consulted in such situations to try to 
determine what the donor would have wanted. Those states that have approved the 
law already, however, will have to wait until next year to amend it. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The measure aims to establish more computerized registries of people who 
have agreed to be donors but makes no similar provision for those who do not 
want to be donors. It also gives organ procurement organizations the power to 
keep potential donors on life-support while they evaluate their organs&rsquo; 
suitability for transplantation. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a patient requiring 
palliative or comfort care, you treat them first. That&rsquo;s clear. This 
doesn&rsquo;t change that balance,&rdquo; said Christina W. Strong, who 
represented the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. &ldquo;What it 
does is make sure that to free up an ICU bed a hospital doesn&rsquo;t forget 
the patient may have wanted to be a donor or their family may want them to be a 
donor.&rdquo; (Washington Post) </p>

<b>$500 million pledged to fight childhood obesity <br>
</b><br>

 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation plans to spend more than $500 million over 
the next five years to reverse the increase in childhood obesity. It is one of 
the largest public health initiatives ever tried by a private philanthropy. 
&ldquo;This is an epidemic that is going to cost the country in terms of 
morbidity and mortality and economically,&rdquo; said Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, 
the foundation&rsquo;s president and chief executive. &ldquo;The younger 
generation is going to live sicker and die younger than their parents because 
of obesity.&rdquo; The foundation estimates that roughly 25 million children 17 
and under are obese or overweight, nearly a third of the 74 million in that age 
group, according to Census Bureau data and a 2006 study published in <i>The 
Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. Many of those children are 
poor and live in neighborhoods where outdoor play is unsafe and access to fresh 
fruits and vegetables is limited. &ldquo;In many cases, the environment makes 
it almost impossible for them to choose healthy lifestyles,&rdquo; Dr. 
Lavizzo-Mourey said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try to change that.&rdquo; 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The foundation plans to invest in programs to improve access to healthy 
food, encourage the development of safe play spaces, increase research to 
enhance understanding of obesity and prod governments into adopting policies to 
address the problem, among other things. Experts on childhood obesity welcomed 
the foundation&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;Government grants for biomedical research 
in general, including obesity research, are being funded at the lowest levels 
I&rsquo;ve seen in my career,&rdquo; said Dr. David Ludwig, director of the 
Optimal Weight for Life Clinic at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston and author 
of a new book, &ldquo;Ending the Food Fight.&rdquo; &ldquo;So we are especially 
dependent on philanthropic support.&rdquo; Philanthropy has long fueled 
improvements in health, from John D. Rockefeller, whose money produced a yellow 
fever vaccine, to Bill and Melinda Gates, who are underwriting new health 
technologies and vaccines to address a variety of global problems. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Robert Wood Johnson, who built Johnson &amp; Johnson into one of the 
world&rsquo;s largest health and medical care products companies, established 
his foundation at his death in 1968 with 10,204,377 shares of the 
company&rsquo;s stock. He committed it to improving the health of Americans. 
Over the last few years, the foundation has pledged $80 million to childhood 
obesity programs, like grants to the Food Trust to persuade supermarket 
operators to return to poor neighborhoods. Its new effort intends to capitalize 
on and enhance efforts by the food industry and school districts and 
governments to address the problem, Dr. Lavizzo-Mourey said. Several snack food 
producers are making changes in their packaging and ingredients, and three 
soft-drink companies said they would no longer supply sweetened drinks to 
school cafeterias and vending machines. Several states have mandated changes in 
school menus, increased physical education requirements and begun reporting 
students&rsquo; body mass index scores to parents. (The New York Times)</p>

</b></p> 
<p> The Health Industry Business Communications Council (HIBCC) and Partners

<p> &nbsp;</p> 10 charged in $5 million Medicare fraud 
<p>  Ten persons were indicted in federal court Tuesday, accused of bilking 
Medicare out of more than $5 million for fraudulent claims for durable medical 
equipment and treatments in expensive infusion therapies intended for AIDS and 
HIV patients. Raul Rodriguez and Armando Arias were accused of committing fraud 
using Coral Way Professional Services and Sunshine Health Center of Miami, as 
well as R&amp;J Medical Services and N.R. Medical Services, both located in 
Miami-Dade County. The infusion therapy schemes have been widespread. According 
to a governor&rsquo;s office report, Florida has far fewer AIDS/HIV cases than 
California or New York, but Florida providers submitted claims for AIDS/HIV 
cases that were more than three times the claims from California and five times 
more than from New York, according to the report. The clinics and their 
operators have been difficult for investigators to track down because they 
often switch names, owners and locations, closing quickly as investigators 
approach.</p> 
<p>  Tuesday&rsquo;s indictment showed what investigators call a typical 
pattern, in which Medicare patients were given kickbacks to indicate they were 
given treatment at the clinics. Besides Rodriguez and Arias, those indicted 
were Carlos Enrique Monteagudo, Alain Rhaf Vega, Marisol Gonzalez Torres, Edith 
Balog, Leonel Galdos Jr., William Balladares, Yulen Arderi and Jannette 
Morales. Balog was accused of being the owner of record of R&amp;J from 
November 2002 to August 2004. Torres was office manager and patient recruiter 
at Coral Way from October 2004 through March 2005, when the clinic closed. The 
indictment charges that the accused received about $2.5 million in fraudulent 
durable medical equipment claims and $3.2 million for false billing of infusion 
therapies. Prosecutors alleged that a medical assistant was told to tamper with 
blood samples to justify the HIV/AIDS therapies and to inject patients with a 
salt solution rather than medications. Rodriguez, Arias, Monteagudo, Vega, 
Galdos and Balladares were also accused of money laundering in alleged attempts 
to hide the money from federal authorities. Rodriguez and Arias were also 
charged with witness tampering in alleged attempts to bribe persons to get them 
to lie to investigators and a grand jury. (Miami Herald) </p>

<h1> Study suggests some drug resistance to influenza B medications</h1> 
<p>Use of certain common antiviral drugs during a recent influenza B epidemic 
in Japan showed the development of viruses with partial resistance to the 
drugs, according to a study in the April 4 issue of<i>JAMA</i>. Two antiviral 
drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir, which are a type of drugs known as 
neuraminidase inhibitors, have been effective against influenza and are used 
extensively. There has been documented evidence of the emergence of 
oseltamivir-resistant type A viruses, but similar information on influenza B 
viruses has been limited. Influenza B viruses are associated with annual 
outbreaks of illness and increased death rates worldwide, according to the 
article.</p> 
<p>Shuji Hatakeyama, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and 
colleagues examined the prevalence and transmissibility of influenza B viruses 
with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors in Japan, where zanamivir 
and oseltamivir are now used more extensively than anywhere else in the world. 
In the winter of 2004-2005, an influenza B virus caused a widespread epidemic 
in Japan, creating an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of neuraminidase 
inhibitors. The researchers identified a variant with reduced drug sensitivity 
in one (1.4 percent) of the 74 children who had received oseltamivir, and seven 
(1.7 percent) of the 422 influenza B viruses isolated from untreated patients 
were found to have reduced sensitivity to zanamivir, oseltamivir, or both. 
Review of the clinical and viral genetic information available on these seven 
patients indicated that four were likely infected in a community setting, while 
the remaining three were probably infected through contact with siblings 
shedding the mutant viruses. &ldquo;Continued surveillance for the emergence or 
spread of neuraminidase inhibitor&ndash;resistant influenza viruses is 
critically important,&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;Further evaluation of 
the biological properties of neuraminidase inhibitor&ndash;resistant influenza 
viruses is needed to fully assess their pathogenicity in humans.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In an accompanying editorial, Anne Moscona, M.D., of Weill Medical College 
of Cornell University, New York, and Jennifer McKimm-Breschkin, Ph.D., of 
Molecular and Health Technologies, Parkville, South Victoria, Australia, 
comment, &ldquo;The report by Hatakeyama et al raises more questions than it 
answers, including questions about viral evolution, biological fitness, and 
transmissibility. But some facts are strikingly clear. Influenza B mutants with 
reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors are circulating, and these 
viruses can cause infections with no difference in duration of symptoms, level 
of viral shedding, or clinical outcome. Contrary to what had been hoped until 
now, some resistant variants are vigorous pathogens. Whether these viruses 
arise by spontaneous mutation or through drug selection, or whether they are 
transmitted within families or acquired from the community, the resistant 
variants may be here to stay. In light of the recent observation that 
oseltamivir may be less effective against influenza B than against influenza A, 
an important concern is whether suboptimal dosing for these viruses will lead 
to increased selection of viruses with high-level resistance.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Influenza viruses evolve rapidly and nimbly, which compels ongoing 
investigation of antiviral therapies that use alternative mechanisms of action 
and target different points in the viral life cycle. The emergence of 
drug-resistant influenza B should draw attention to the importance of continual 
monitoring of strains over time and to the need for frequent rethinking of 
policies for use of antiviral drugs. While the news about resistance is not 
good and certainly calls into question some of the current assumptions about 
drug-resistant viruses, an effective response to this news can help contend 
with the new challenges of influenza.&rdquo;</p>

</i> HealthGrades patient-safety study shows hospital errors rise 
3 percent</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Patient safety incidents at the nation&rsquo;s hospitals rose three 
percent over the years 2003 to 2005, but the nation&rsquo;s top-performing 
hospitals had a 40 percent lower rate of medical errors when compared with the 
poorest-performing hospitals, according to the largest annual study of 
patient-safety issued by HealthGrades, the leading independent healthcare 
ratings company.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The HealthGrades study of 40.56 million Medicare hospitalization records 
over the years 2003 to 2005 found: Patient-safety incidents continue to rise in 
American hospitals, with 1.16 million preventable patient-safety incidents 
occurring over the three years studied among Medicare patients in the 
nation&rsquo;s hospitals, an incidence rate of 2.86 percent; 247,662 deaths 
were potentially preventable over the three years, and Medicare patients who 
had one or more patient-safety incidents had a one-in-four chance of dying; The 
excess cost to hospitals was $8.6 billion over three years, with some of the 
most common incidents proving to be the most costly; Ten of the 16 
patient-safety incidents tracked worsened from 2003 to 2005, by an average of 
almost 12 percent, while seven incidents improved, on average, by six percent. 
Patient-safety incidents with the greatest increase in incident rates were post 
operative sepsis (34.28 percent), post-operative respiratory failure (18.70 
percent) and selected infections due to medical care (12.23 percent); and 
Patient-safety incidents with the highest incidence rates were decubitus ulcer, 
failure to rescue and post-operative respiratory failure.</p> 
<p>Of the nearly 5,000 hospitals studied, the HealthGrades study identified 
242 hospitals, those in the top five percent of all hospitals, to serve as a 
benchmark against which other hospitals can be evaluated, naming them 
Distinguished Hospitals for Patient Safety. On average, these hospitals had a 
40 percent lower rate of patient-safety incidents when compared with the 
poorest-performing hospitals. If all hospitals performed at the level of the 
Distinguished Hospitals for Patient Safety, the study found: Approximately 
206,286 patient-safety incidents and 34,393 Medicare deaths could have been 
avoided; and $1.74 billion could have been saved.</p> 
<p> To be ranked in overall patient-safety performance, hospitals had to be 
rated in at least 19 of the 28 procedures and diagnoses rated by HealthGrades 
and have a current overall HealthGrades star rating of at least 2.5 out of 5.0. 
The final ranking set included 752 teaching hospitals and 857 non-teaching 
hospitals. The top 15 percent, or 242 hospitals, were identified as 
Distinguished Hospitals for Patient Safety, and represent less than five 
percent of all U.S. hospitals examined in the study. The study says, 
&ldquo;Despite the flurry of research, publications and process improvement 
activity that has occurred since the IOM report there is a growing consensus 
that not much progress has been made leading to a visible national impact. Our 
findings support this consensus. However, our findings also support that 
progress continues to be made at the top. Distinguished Hospitals for Patient 
Safety continue to lead the nation in providing safer care&hellip;resulting in 
much lower costs to society. We believe that Distinguished Hospitals have 
deliberately chosen and maintained patient safety as a top priority.&rdquo; For

Mammograms for women in their 40s should be based on individual
</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Should all women in their 40s be routinely screened for breast 
cancer? Not necessarily, according to the American College of Physicians. In a 
new set of guidelines for clinicians of 40-something patients, the group 
recommends that mammography screening decisions be made on a case-by-case 
basis. It advises clinicians to discuss the benefits and harms of screening 
with the patient, as well as each woman&rsquo;s individual cancer risk and 
preference about screening. The organization based its recommendations, which 
will be published in the April 3 issue of<i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>, on 
a rigorous review of evidence showing there is variation in the benefits and 
harms associated with mammography among women in their 40s. The American 
College of Physicians is the leading professional organization for internal 
medicine specialists, with a membership of 120,000.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are important benefits to screening mammography, but we 
believe the decision to be screened should be based on an informed conversation 
between a patient and her physician,&rdquo; said health policy expert Douglas 
K. Owens, MD, MS, a researcher with the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care 
System and a professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of 
Medicine, who chaired the committee that developed the guidelines. &ldquo;In 
our view, the evidence doesn&rsquo;t support a blanket recommendation for women 
in this age group.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer related death among 
women in the United States; according to the American Cancer Society, 25 
percent of all diagnosed cases are among women younger than age 50. Among these 
younger women, the risk of breast cancer varies greatly, from less than 1 
percent for a 40-year-old woman with no risk factors to 6 percent for a 
49-year-old woman with multiple risk factors, which include family history of 
breast cancer, older age at the birth of her first child and younger age at the 
onset of menstruation. While it is well-established that mammography reduces 
mortality from breast cancer in 50- to 70-year-old women, and that women in 
this age-group should be routinely screened, the evidence isn&rsquo;t as 
clear-cut for younger women.</p> 
<p>Because of the ongoing controversy, the American College of 
Physicians&rsquo; Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee decided to take its 
own look at the evidence related to screening in women in their 40s. After 
their review, the group concluded that screening mammography for women in this 
age group likely provides a modest reduction in breast cancer mortality, but, 
as with any screening intervention, it also comes with the risk of potential 
harms. Based on this, it recommended that clinicians: Periodically perform 
individualized assessment of risk for breast cancer to help guide decisions 
about screening mammography; Inform women ages 40 to 49 of the potential 
benefits and harms of screening mammography; Base screening mammography 
decisions on benefits and harms of screening as well as a woman's preferences 
and breast cancer risk profile. In the new guidelines, the organization 
emphasizes the importance of using a woman&rsquo;s concerns about breast cancer 
and screening to help guide decision-making about mammography. Women&rsquo;s 
thoughts about mammography or their risks of developing breast cancer will 
likely vary greatly, the group notes, but it expects the potential reduction in 
breast cancer mortality associated with screening to outweigh other 
considerations for many women. &ldquo;We still think many women will choose to 
get mammography, and we're supportive of that,&rdquo; said Owens. &ldquo;The 
most important thing is that women be well-informed about the decision they're 
making.&rdquo;</p>

improve healthcare supply chain performance analysis over the next two years. 
Through the partnership, AHRMM and ASU will develop an online benchmarking and 
performance improvement tool using well established research method techniques 
that have been successfully applied to improving supply chain performance in 
other industries. This tool will allow hospitals and providers to compare their 
performance with organizations of similar size and operation. The<i> Healthcare 
Supply Chain Benchmarking and Performance Improvements Metrics</i> is in the 
first phase of development. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Despite past success with benchmarking, healthcare organizations 
still need a consistent, actionable, and credible measure to ensure accurate 
comparisons and reporting of financial and other supply chain measures,&rdquo; 
said Deborah Sprindzunas, AHRMM&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;By 
identifying and developing effective indicators of supply chain performance as 
well as metrics for evaluating partner performance, AHRMM and ASU&rsquo;s new 
tool will lead the way toward consistent, transferable performance 
analysis.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p> 
<p> During the first phase the research team plans to engage industry experts 
in the identification, evaluation, and selection of target metrics for the 
healthcare field. The second phase involves development of a data capture and 
online benchmarking tool for use by practicing supply chain managers. The third 
phase moves this project to initial data collection and model validation 
activities where a sample of targeted organizations will provide data for 
validating the metric definitions and testing the use of the benchmarking and 
analysis tool. During the final phase, full scale data collection commences. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;The <i> Healthcare Supply Chain Benchmarking and Performance

best performer, it will also determine best known practices and capabilities 
that have yet to be adopted by the majority of the industry,&rdquo; explained 
Vicki Smith-Daniels, Professor of Supply Chain Management, W.P. Carey School of 
Business, Arizona State University. Associations representing various 
healthcare professions will be invited to participate in benchmarking and 
performance improvement analysis on a frequent basis, allowing for longitudinal 
analysis of supply chain performance improvement in the field of healthcare.<br>

<b> Is it the flu? Get the fast flu test</b></p> 
<p> <br>
 Fast flu tests, which drastically cut the time to diagnose a patient 
with influenza or not, are helping doctors better treat the illness, according 
to a recent study and medical experts. Timing is key in treating the flu, said 
Dr. Greg Poland of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. If diagnosed early enough, 
from 24 to 48 hours after a patient first shows symptoms, a treatment of 
antiviral drugs can alleviate the severity of symptoms, cut down on the number 
of days sick and decrease potential complications, Poland said. &ldquo;I think 
all through my career, what the medical system tried to teach people is that 
when you have a virus or influenza, don&rsquo;t come in because there is 
nothing we can do,&rdquo; Poland said. &ldquo;Now, what we are saying is that 
medical science has advanced.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The rapid diagnostic tests can take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to 
come up with a diagnosis. In contrast, results for a traditional viral culture 
test can take several days to a week. The rapid tests generally involve a nasal 
or throat swab and can be examined in the doctor&rsquo;s office. A viral 
culture also usually collects a fluid sample that is sent to a laboratory. The 
use of these rapid tests has been growing during the past few years and more 
than 10 variations of the tests have been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration, the CDC said. Depending on the test used and if conducted 
properly, they register about a 70 percent accuracy rate in diagnosing whether 
a patient has the flu and are about 90 percent specific in figuring out what 
type of flu it is, the CDC said. &ldquo;Done improperly, and I think a lot get 
done improperly, the sensitivity falls dramatically,&rdquo; Poland said. The 
traditional culture tests are more consistently accurate and they can 
distinguish between flu subtypes with more specificity. &ldquo;The gold 
standard is still a culture, but the gold standard is not timely, hence its 
usefulness in diagnosis and treatment is limited,&rdquo; Poland said. </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Research shows the tests are having an effect on treatment. Rapid testing 
has led to a decreased use of antibiotics in the treatment of children with the 
flu, according to a recent study conducted by Rochester General Hospital and 
the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. The tests also 
have helped lead to shorter hospital stays for kids and lessened the amount of 
extra laboratory testing, the study said. The diagnostic tests also could be a 
benefit for the public health sector because they make it easier to keep track 
of test results. In some cases, especially with longer laboratory testing 
periods, different doctors and nurses may handle the testing process and 
reporting the results to public health agencies gets lost in the shuffle, 
Poland said. However, with a rapid test, where results are in-house and the 
process is shorter, the reporting is more accurate. Consequently, surveillance 
of possible outbreaks across the country is enhanced, doctors said.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Context plays an important role in deciding when to use the test, said Dr. 
Henry Bernstein of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Dartmouth in New Hampshire 
and also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; committee on 
infectious diseases. For example, early in the season, the U.S. flu season can 
last from late December through March, the rapid tests are useful because many 
patients mistake symptoms of other illnesses for the flu, he said. However, in 
the midst of the flu season when a specific community might be overrun by the 
illness, the tests might be impractical or a waste of money. The reasons for 
being judicious in using the tests, especially if done improperly, increasing 
the chances of an inaccurate diagnosis, are twofold, doctors say. Antiviral 
doses are limited each flu season and prescribing them indiscriminately could 
build a resistance to the drugs in the community, doctors say. The rapid 
diagnostic tests have been around for several years and are widely used, with 
some insurance plans covering them. Yet only now are people growing more aware 
of them, said Poland. (CNN)<br>

criteria outlined in the final rule.&nbsp;The program will be expanded into 70 
additional MSAs in 2009. After 2009, CMS will expand the program to additional 
areas and items. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new competitive bidding program, which is required by the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement &amp; Modernization Act of 2003, will replace 
the current payment amounts, for the items being bid, under Medicare&rsquo;s 
DMEPOS fee schedule with payment rates derived from the bidding 
process.&nbsp;Suppliers that wish to furnish competitively bid items in a CBA 
will be required to submit bids to furnish those items. Contracts will be 
awarded to a sufficient number of winning bidders in each CBA to ensure access 
and service to high quality DMEPOS items.&nbsp;The winning bids will be used to 
establish a single Medicare payment amount for each item. For beneficiaries in 
the selected CBAs, this program will reduce out-of-pocket expenses while 
ensuring that they receive high quality items and services.&nbsp;This is 
because the rule requires all contracting suppliers to be accredited by an 
approved accreditation organization as meeting CMS&rsquo; quality 
standards.&nbsp;CMS has designated 10 entities as qualified to accredit DME 
suppliers, based on quality standards that were posted on the CMS website in 
August 2006.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The single payment amounts established through 
competitive bidding will be lower than the current fee schedule amounts for the 
items. In addition, contract suppliers must accept the single payment amount 
established through competitive bidding as payment in full.&nbsp;The 
beneficiary&rsquo;s liability is limited to 20 percent of the payment amount 
and any unmet Part B deductible. For taxpayers, the competitive bidding program 
means potentially significant savings for Medicare.&nbsp;When fully implemented 
in 2010, it is projected that these savings will amount to $1 billion 
annually.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CMS is creating a limited exception to the competitive bidding requirement 
that will allow certain treating professionals to furnish items on the 
competitive bidding list to their own patients without having to participate in 
bidding and without becoming a contract supplier.&nbsp;This exception would 
apply to certain specified items furnished by physicians, physician assistants, 
clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, occupational therapists in 
private practice, and physical therapists in private practice. The item must be 
furnished as part of their professional services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CMS has included in the final rule a number of provisions that will modify 
the rule&rsquo;s impact on small suppliers.&nbsp;CMS worked closely with the 
Small Business Administration to establish a new definition of small suppliers 
that is reflective of this area of the health care industry.&nbsp;The use of 
this new definition, in conjunction with policies established in the final 
regulation, will enhance the ability of small suppliers to participate in the 
competitive bidding program.The final rule will be published in the <i>Federal 
Register</i> on April 10. For more information  CLICK HERE.</p>

<p><b> NIAID expands capability for influenza research and surveillance</b> 
</p> 
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced it is awarding $23 million 
per year for seven years to establish six Centers of Excellence for Influenza 
Research and Surveillance. Collectively, the centers will expand NIAID&rsquo;s 
influenza surveillance program internationally and in the United States, and 
will bolster influenza research in key areas, including understanding how the 
virus causes disease and how the human immune system responds to infection with 
the virus. The goal of the newly created centers is to provide the federal 
government with important information to inform public health strategies for 
controlling and lessening the impact of seasonal influenza as well as an 
influenza pandemic.</p> 
<p>The new awards build upon an ongoing program led by St. Jude 
Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital in Memphis, TN, initiated by NIAID after the 
1997 Hong Kong outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans. NIAID 
is expanding the surveillance and research program to now include six Centers 
of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance, residing at St. Jude 
Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, Memphis, University of California at Los 
Angeles, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Emory University, Atlanta, Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine, New York City and University of Rochester, Rochester, 
NY.</p> 
<p>Their work will include determining the prevalence of avian influenza in 
animals that routinely come into close contact with people; understanding how 
flu viruses evolve, adapt and transmit infection; and identifying immunological 
factors that can determine whether a flu virus causes only mild illness or 
death. Additionally, some centers will monitor for international and domestic 
cases of animal and human influenza to rapidly detect and characterize viruses 
that may have pandemic potential and to create vaccine candidates targeted to 
those viruses. Ultimately, these studies will lay the groundwork for developing 
new and improved control measures for emerging and reemerging flu viruses. For

<h1> Family members most often source of whooping cough in young infants</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Infants with whooping cough were most likely infected by the people 
they live with, according to a multi-country study led by researchers from the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health. The study 
found that parents were the source of pertussis, commonly known as whooping 
cough, in 55 percent of infants. In all, household members including siblings, 
aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents were responsible for 75 percent of 
pertussis cases among infants for whom a source could be identified. The 
results appear in the April 2007 issue of the<i>Pediatric Infectious Disease 
Journal</i>.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Although pertussis vaccination has reduced the number of reported cases in 
industrialized countries by more than 95 percent from what it was in the 1950s, 
the number of reported pertussis cases in the United States has tripled in the 
past two decades. &ldquo;It is important to understand how the disease is 
spread, particularly to infants who are too young to be vaccinated themselves, 
so that steps can be taken to prevent infections in these vulnerable infants 
and potentially save lives,&rdquo; said Dr. Annelies Van Rie, assistant 
professor of epidemiology in the UNC School of Public Health and the 
study&rsquo;s senior author. &ldquo;It is troubling to learn that infants are 
often infected with pertussis by their own family members, who are often 
unaware of having pertussis themselves, and in whom pertussis could have been 
prevented if they had received a pertussis booster vaccination,&rdquo; she said.
</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The study, funded by grants from the Institut Pasteur Foundation, Sanofi 
Pasteur and Sanofi Pasteur-MSD, was conducted over a 20-month period in four 
countries, Canada, France, Germany and the United States. The researchers found 
that among infants with pertussis for whom the source case could be identified, 
parents were the primary source of pertussis in infants, followed by siblings 
(16 percent), aunts/uncles (10 percent), friends/cousins (10 percent), 
grandparents (6 percent) and part-time caregivers (2 percent). &ldquo;Ongoing 
research, such as this study, demonstrates that adolescents and adults can 
transmit pertussis to infants,&rdquo; Van Rie said. &ldquo;Pertussis 
immunization of adolescents and adults, especially those in contact with young 
infants would not only protect themselves form pertussis, but would also 
protect young infants from pertussis and could save lives.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Newborns who are too young to be fully vaccinated against the disease are 
more vulnerable to severe pertussis and face the possibility of serious 
complications and even death. Infants account for more than 90 percent of 
pertussis deaths in the U.S. The disease is spread though airborne droplets 
that are transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The infected 
person may look and feel healthy between episodes of coughing. If left 
untreated, people infected with pertussis can spread the disease for several 
weeks.</p> 
<p>Reports of pertussis have increased most dramatically among adolescents and 
adults. This is partly because pertussis immunity from early childhood 
vaccinations wears off, leaving adults and adolescents susceptible to the 
disease. Most adolescents and adults are not diagnosed with pertussis because 
they frequently have milder cases of the disease and physicians still perceive 
pertussis as a childhood disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention now recommends that adults and adolescents be given a 
tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis booster (Tdap) in place of the tetanus-diphtheria 
(Td) booster to reduce the burden of pertussis in the United States. </p>

</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<h1> Premier acquires CareScience, strengthening ability of hospitals to 
improve quality while safely reducing cost</h1> 
<p>On Friday, March 30, 2007, Quovadx, Inc. and Premier Inc. simultaneously 
signed a definitive agreement and closed the related transaction wherein 
Premier purchased all outstanding shares of CareScience stock for $34.9 
million, or a multiple of approximately 2.3 times CareScience's 2006 revenue. 
The transaction was approved by the Boards of Directors of both Quovadx and 
Premier. The final purchase price is subject to certain post-closing 
adjustments, including the final calculation of working capital for CareScience 
as of March 31, 2007. The sale is not expected to result in any income taxes 
due from Quovadx.</p> 
<p>&quot;CareScience's robust clinical analytics, research capabilities and 
dedicated employees enhance Premier's industry-leading capabilities for 
improving healthcare quality while safely reducing the cost of care,&quot; said 
Stephanie Alexander, Premier senior vice president. &quot;We look forward to 
creating new and enhanced solutions that will provide hospitals and health 
systems greater access to the expertise, clinical research and 
knowledge-sharing they need to meet the critical challenges facing healthcare 
today.&quot;</p> 
<p>Together, Premier and CareScience serve more than 900 hospitals. 
CareScience's physician-accepted, clinical expertise complements Premier's 
process improvement focus and unparalleled database of hospital comparative 
data. Premier&rsquo;s Performance Suite is a single source for integrating 
quality and safety, labor management, and supply chain efficiency. It provides 
Web-based performance measurement and benchmarking, real-time surveillance and 
best practices to help improve quality and reduce costs. CareScience works with 
hospitals to use comparative data as the basis for implementing clinical 
quality improvement plans that optimize patient outcomes and operational 
performance, increase staff efficiency and reduce costs.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The acquisition of CareScience further demonstrates Premier&rsquo;s 
commitment to its long-term goal of reshaping American healthcare in ways that 
make it the safest, most effective and efficient system in the world,&rdquo; 
said Susan DeVore, Premier&rsquo;s chief operating officer. &ldquo;The greatest 
challenge for hospitals today is improving quality of care while safely 
reducing costs. Today&rsquo;s agreement will help hospitals across the nation 
meet that challenge.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In a second transaction Sunday, April 1, 2007, Quovadx Inc. and Battery

<h1><i> New York Times</i>: Some hospitals call 911 to save their patients</h1>
<p> Should a hospital be able to handle a medical emergency? Patients at some 
hospitals may find the staff resorting to what someone might do at home in a 
crisis: call 911 for an ambulance. That happened recently in Texas, where a 
44-year-old man named Steve Spivey developed breathing problems after spine 
surgery. No physician was working there when the staff first recognized he was 
in trouble. They phoned 911, and he was taken to a nearby full-service 
hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. The episode occurred 
at a small hospital that is owned and run by doctors, one of roughly 140 such 
hospitals around the country, with nearly two dozen more under development, 
that are set up to specialize in certain types of procedures like heart 
surgery, back operations and hip replacements. These hospitals have been 
assailed for cherry-picking the most profitable procedures from the 
nation&rsquo;s 4,500 or so full-service hospitals. Critics have argued that the 
doctors have a financial incentive in sending patients to their own facilities, 
even when those patients might be better off having their surgery in regular 
hospitals. But the Texas case, and others like it, have invited new scrutiny 
from regulators and members of Congress about these hospitals&rsquo; ability to 
care for patients who suffer complications after their operations.<br>
<br>
 
While some of these hospitals are large sophisticated operations, like those 
hospitals specializing in cardiac care, others are much more modest. Small 
surgical hospitals may not have separate emergency facilities or, as in the 
Texas case, a doctor on site at all times during a patient&rsquo;s recovery. As 
the number of doctor-owned surgical hospitals grows, federal and state 
officials now acknowledge that the government rules may be too vague about the 
emergency abilities a hospital must have in place. Regulators are particularly 
concerned about the very small hospitals that focus on only a few kinds of 
surgery but perform operations that frequently require an overnight stay. While 
Medicare&rsquo;s rules currently say a hospital must &ldquo;meet the emergency 
needs of patients in accordance with acceptable standards of practice,&rdquo; 
the details are left largely to the hospital&rsquo;s discretion. Federal and 
state officials say they are now reviewing the guidelines to toughen the rules 
and make them more specific. Medicare recently terminated its agreement with 
the facility involved in the Texas case, West Texas Hospital, a 14-bed hospital 
in Abilene that performed procedures ranging from plastic surgery to complex 
spine operations. Although the chief executive of West Texas Hospital defended 
its practices, he said it would not appeal the government&rsquo;s decision. The 
hospital has since closed.<br>
<br>
 The doctors who set up the specialized 
hospitals defend them by saying that by running the centers themselves and 
concentrating only on certain procedures, they can provide the best results for 
patients. Proponents of the specialty hospitals say the Abilene and such cases 
are aberrations that critics are exploiting to defend the turf of full-service 
hospitals. They say they are able to handle their patients&rsquo; medical 
emergencies, whether or not they have emergency departments. But some members 
of Congress are now pushing Medicare to take a closer look at how such 
hospitals are regulated. &ldquo;The problem with physician-owned specialty 
hospitals is that decision-making is more likely to be driven by financial 
interest rather than patient interest,&rdquo; said Senator Charles E. Grassley, 
(R-IA). &ldquo;You see it in the cherry-picking of patients, and with policies 
that instruct hospital staff to call 911 for the local community hospital if 
emergency care is needed,&rdquo; said Grassley, a ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Finance, which oversees Medicare. Congress has asked for various 
reports on the issue, including a comprehensive analysis last year by the 
federal Department of Health and Human Services. (The New York Times) To read

<p><b> Dengue surging in Mexico, Latin America</b>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The deadly hemorrhagic form of dengue fever is increasing dramatically in 
Mexico, and experts predict a surge throughout Latin America fueled by climate 
change, migration and faltering mosquito eradication efforts. Overall dengue 
cases have increased by more than 600 percent in Mexico since 2001, and worried 
officials are sending special teams to tourist resorts to spray pesticides and 
remove garbage and standing water where mosquitoes breed ahead of the peak 
Easter Week vacation season. Even classic dengue, known as &ldquo;bonebreak 
fever&rdquo;, can cause severe flu-like symptoms, excruciating joint pain, high 
fever, nausea and rashes. More alarming is that a deadly hemorrhagic form of 
the disease, which adds internal and external bleeding to the symptoms, is 
becoming more common. It accounts for one in four cases in Mexico, compared 
with one in 50 seven years ago, according to Mexico&rsquo;s Public Health 
Department.</p> 
<p> While hemorrhagic dengue is increasing around the developing world, the 
problem is most dramatic in the Americas, according to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. Dengue is driven by longer rainy seasons some blame on 
climate change, as well as disposable plastic packaging and other trash that 
collects water. Migrants and tourists, including the many thousands of 
Americans expected for spring break this year, carry new strains of the virus 
across national borders, where mosquitoes can spread the disease. The CDC says 
there&rsquo;s no drug to treat hemorrhagic dengue, but proper treatment, 
including rest, fluids and pain relief, can reduce death rates to about 1 
percent. Latin America&rsquo;s hospitals are ill-equipped to handle major 
outbreaks, and officials say the virus is likely to grow deadlier, in part 
because tourism and migration are circulating four different strains across the 
region. A person exposed to one strain may develop immunity to that strain, but 
subsequent exposure to another strain makes it more likely the person will 
develop the hemorrhagic form. This dengue spread &ldquo;is one of the 
primordial public health problems the country faces,&rdquo; said Mexico&rsquo;s 
Public Health Department, which has sent hundreds of workers to the resorts of 
Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Acapulco to try to avert outbreaks ahead of the 
Easter week vacation. &ldquo;We are working intensively, both the federal and 
state governments, on (these) three sites that we want to keep under control, 
so that it doesn&rsquo;t become a risk for tourists,&rdquo; said Pablo Kuri, 
head of Mexico&rsquo;s National Center for Epidemiology and Disease Control. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Canadian Embassy in Mexico City issued an alert about dengue after 
five Canadians were sickened in Puerto Vallarta earlier this year. Acapulco, a 
city of 700,000, has documented 549 cases of classic and hemorrhagic dengue in 
the first two months of 2007, up from just 86 for the same period last year. In 
January and February, Mexico&rsquo;s dry season, there were 1,589 cases of both 
types of dengue nationwide, up 380 percent from the same period in 2006, Kuri 
said. And last year was also bad for dengue: Mexico documented 27,000 
infections overall, including 4,477 hemorrhagic cases and 20 deaths, compared 
with 1,781 cases overall in 2001. Dengue has been found along the U.S.-Mexico 
border, where 151 classic and 46 hemorrhagic cases were recorded last year in 
the Gulf state of Tamaulipas, south of Texas. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, made up of the world&rsquo;s leading climate scientists, 
predicted in March that global warming and climate change would cause an 
upsurge in dengue. The global solution to dengue outbreaks is mosquito control, 
and faltering eradication efforts, together with climate change, probably share 
blame for dengue&rsquo;s rise in the Americas, Kuri said. (Associated Press)<br>

<h1> Severe dengue infections may go unrecognized in international travelers
</h1> 
<p> <br>
 Severe cases of a common travelers&rsquo; infection may not be 
recognized if doctors rely on the World Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) 
guidelines for identifying it, according to a new study published in the April 
15 issue of<i>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</i>, now available online. 
Dengue is the most important emerging disease among international travelers, 
with a 30-fold increase in incidence over the past 50 years worldwide. Like 
malaria, dengue is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. &nbsp;Most cases are 
mild. Symptoms include fever, rash, headache, pain behind the eyes, and muscle 
and joint pain.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> According to the WHO, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is characterized by 
fever, low platelet count, clinical evidence of leaking capillaries, and 
spontaneous bleeding or fragile blood vessels. The most serious cases can lead 
to shock and death. There is no cure for dengue infection, but management of 
the disease&rsquo;s effects can prevent the worst outcomes. The study, 
conducted by Ole Wichmann, MD, MCTM, DTM&amp;H, at the Robert Koch Institute in 
Berlin, Germany, and colleagues throughout Europe, collected data through the 
European Network on Surveillance of Imported Diseases at 14 sites in 8 European 
countries.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Out of more than 200 patients treated for dengue infection at these sites 
over two years, less than 1 percent fit all four criteria necessary to meet the 
WHO definition of DHF. However, 11 percent had at least one manifestation of 
severe dengue disease, and a total of 23 percent required hospitalization due 
to dengue-related symptoms. &ldquo;Dengue exists more as a continuous 
spectrum,&rdquo; Dr. Wichmann said. &ldquo;Severe disease can be present in 
patients who do not fulfill all four DHF criteria.&rdquo; &ldquo;The term 
&lsquo;dengue hemorrhagic fever&rsquo; puts undue emphasis on bleeding,&rdquo; 
he added, noting that plasma leakage and shock can occur without it. 
&ldquo;Clinicians who mainly focus on bleeding...may miss the most important 
conditions that require hospitalization and treatment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Their findings also showed that travelers who acquire a second dengue 
infection are more at risk for severe cases of dengue, although some patients 
had severe symptoms when infected during their first trip to a dengue-endemic 
country. It is becoming more and more crucial that health care providers 
understand the clinical spectrum of dengue and its diagnosis. &ldquo;Given the 
increase in business travel and other travel, and the global spread of dengue 
fever, these findings have important implications for the future burden of 
severe imported dengue infections,&rdquo; Wichmann said. As a next step to 
their study Wichmann highlighted the need for more inquiry into a clinical 
definition of dengue. &ldquo;In order to perform more uniform surveillance and 
research, including vaccine trials, studies are urgently needed to establish 
new and more robust definitions for severe dengue.&rdquo; </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> Universal red blood cells could relieve blood bank shortages</b></p> 
<p> An international team of academic and industry scientists has come up with 
a feasible way of making universal red blood cells that are stripped of their 
blood type. The hope is that it can be developed into a viable way of relieving 
blood bank shortages. The study is published in the early online edition of the 
journal<i>Nature Biotechnology</i>. The idea of &ldquo;universal red blood 
cells&rdquo; has been around for some time and its feasibility has been 
demonstrated in clinical trials. For example, scientists in the US about 25 
years ago managed to use a coffee bean glycosidase enzyme to strip the B 
antigen from red blood cells. But the process proved to be impractical.</p> 
<p> In the new study, a team of scientists led by Professor Henrik Clausen 
from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, found a more abundant source of 
glycosidase enzymes in bacteria. They found two bacterial glycosidase gene 
families with enzymes that efficiently remove A and B antigens from red blood 
cells (RBCs). Prof Clausen and colleagues conclude that &ldquo;The enzymatic 
conversion processes we describe hold promise for achieving the goal of 
producing universal RBCs, which would improve the blood supply while enhancing 
the safety of clinical transfusions&rdquo;. The university scientists worked 
with US industry scientists from ZymeQuest in Beverly, MA. The next step is to 
start clinical trials to test the method&rsquo;s treatment safety and 
efficiency. (Medical News Today) </p>

<b> Conflict-of-interest inquiry may be reopening at NIH</b></p> 
<p>Federal investigators are reviewing the activities of 103 scientists who 
may have had improper links to pharmaceutical companies while they were 
employed at the National Institutes of Health, apparently resurrecting a 
conflict-of-interest inquiry that many in the agency thought was closed. In a 
letter sent to several members of Congress on March 23, Daniel R. Levinson, 
inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, said his 
office is looking into the cases &ldquo;to determine whether investigation is 
warranted.&rdquo; Levinson also wrote that his office is reviewing whether NIH 
isadequately monitoring potential conflicts of interest among its thousands of 
grant recipients, typically university researchers. Members of Congress and 
watchdog groups have long called for such a review, noting that 
conflict-of-interest policies at universities are generally more lenient than 
those at NIH. The concern, critics say, is that federal grant money not go to 
scientists who may be predisposed to get results that favor their drug company 
sponsors. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Scientific and academic organizations counter that adequate safeguards are 
already in place and fear that many of the nation&rsquo;s best scientists would 
leave the federally funded research enterprise if options for outside income 
were lost. NIH officials had already looked into the 103 cases of possible 
conflict of interest in 2004, after a congressional inquiry suggested that 
scores of researchers may have taken drug industry money without approval. As a 
result of that investigation, NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni in 2005 banned all 
such consulting by NIH employees. Agency investigators concluded that about 
half of those who were suspected of wrongdoing and who were still employed at 
NIH (and thus available for questioning) had indeed violated policies, 
including 10 who the agency concluded may have violated federal law. NIH 
referred only those 10 cases to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), 
which referred two to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. One 
resulted in a conviction for criminal conflict of interest; the other is still 
pending. With new ethics policies in place and the 2008 budget fight starting, 
many in the agency had hoped that the worst was behind them. But the Levinson 
letter suggests not.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A spokesman for Levinson said he was not at liberty to say why the OIG had 
renewed its interest in the cases. But the letter, made public by the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee, which has spearheaded inquiries into NIH for 
years, said the review began about six months ago. That is about when committee 
members complained loudly that too many of those who were found to have 
violated NIH rules had gotten off with only modest disciplinary action. In a 
joint statement released yesterday, Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell
 (D-MI) asserted that &ldquo;NIH bungled the investigation the first time 
around,&rdquo; and ranking Republican Joe L. Barton (TX) expressed hope that 
the inquiry &ldquo;will finally sort things out so everyone can have confidence 
that the public's interest is being fully served.&rdquo; NIH spokesman John 
Burklow said: &ldquo;We welcome the additional review; however, we are 
confident in the rigor of our process.&rdquo; (Washington Post)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> Russia sees ill effects of &lsquo;General Winter&rsquo;s&rsquo; retreat
</b></p> 
<p>Experts have long feared that Earth&rsquo;s warming climate would cause 
tropical diseases such as malaria to spread into more temperate zones, but a 
dramatic example of an apparently climate-related disease outbreak cropped up 
this winter in a cold place, Russia. More than 3,000 cases of infections caused 
by hantaviruses have been reported so far in Russian cities and towns, 
including many that are within a few hundred miles of Moscow, such as Voronezh 
and Lipetsk. The viruses can cause a serious, and sometimes deadly, disease 
known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, or HFRS. During Russia&rsquo;s 
more typically frigid winters, scientists believe, HFRS-causing viruses die off 
in the consistently below-zero temperatures. But this winter has been anything 
but cold. On Dec. 7 Moscow hit a record 46 degrees Fahrenheit. HFRS was last on 
a rampage in Russia in 1997, coinciding with another very warm winter. By 
mid-spring that year, the number of cases reached more than 20,000. The viruses 
are transmitted to humans when infected mice set up housekeeping in the nooks 
and crannies of homes, barns, sheds and other buildings. If droppings left by 
the mice are disturbed, the viruses waft up and out of the excretions like a 
miasma, infecting people who breathe the air. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Biologists estimate that the current population of rodents in Russia is 10 
times as high as in previous years, and that one in three mice is infected with 
an HFRS-causing virus. Most researchers attribute the spike to the unusually 
warm weather, although some think a natural cycle in mouse populations may play 
a role. &ldquo;Global warming has tipped a balance,&rdquo; said Irina 
Gavrilovskaya, a scientist and physician at the State University of New York at 
Stony Brook who has conducted research on HFRS at the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences in Moscow. &ldquo;Because of the lack of snow cover on Russian 
fields, the country has had an explosion in numbers of virus-carrying 
mice.&rdquo; With the coming of spring, Lyudmial Kirillov, the regional 
epidemiologist in Lipetsk, is predicting a new outbreak as the little snow that 
fell this winter melts and hibernating, and virus-carrying, mice awaken. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Over the past decade, unusually warm winters and large populations of mice 
have also been responsible for outbreaks in New Mexico and nearby states of a 
related illness, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. As of last year, some 10 states 
had reported 30 or more cases of the syndrome since 1993, when the virus was 
identified. More than 20 other hantaviruses threaten people in China, Korea, 
Northern and Western Europe, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Panama, and Canada. Some 
of those outbreaks have also been linked to climate change, higher temperatures 
or altered patterns of rainfall, and its effect on rodents. &ldquo;Climate 
change is about more than a warming Earth,&rdquo; said David Blockstein, senior 
scientist at the National Council for Science and the Environment, a scientific 
advocacy group in Washington. &ldquo;Climate change is turning environmental 
issues into public health issues.&rdquo; (Washington Post) <br>

<b> CHeS Webinar series focuses on benefits of synchronized product 
data across the health care industry</b> </p> 
<p> The Coalition for Healthcare eStandards (CHeS) is launching an educational 
Webinar series focusing on the need for supply chain data synchronization to 
reduce costs and increase efficiencies in the U.S. health care industry. The 
series brings together industry experts who are championing efforts to launch a 
health care product data utility (PDU), similar to systems already successfully 
streamlining the exchange of supply chain information in other large 
industries. Join CHeS and industry participants in an engaging Webinar series 
about how a PDU can benefit hospitals and suppliers, as well as the industry as 
a whole, and learn how to participate in efforts to accelerate adoption of a 
PDU for health care. Register online at http://chestandards.org/pduwebinars.htm.
