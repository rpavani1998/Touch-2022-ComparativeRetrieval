<p>The average normal body temperature is 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F), although it 
may vary a bit throughout the day. If your child's temperature is higher than 
normal, your child has a fever.</p> 
<p>Usually, a fever is a sign that the body is fighting an infection. When the 
body's defense (immune) system is activated by a germ, many reactions occur in 
the body. Fever is one sign of these reactions. Fever is not a disease or 
illness itself.</p> 
<h2>Measuring body temperature</h2> 
<p>Children often feel warm to the touch when they have a fever. To confirm 
that your child has a fever, use a thermometer to measure your child's body 
temperature.</p> Oral Temperature <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>In a baby, the most accurate way to measure temperature is with a 
thermometer inserted into the anus (rectal temperature). A rectal temperature 
higher than 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) means a fever.</li> 
<li>In older children, the temperature can be measured by mouth (oral 
temperature). An oral temperature higher than 37.5&deg;C (99.5&deg;F) means a 
fever.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other methods of measuring temperature may sometimes be useful, but the 
measurement may be less accurate. These methods include:</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>using a thermometer in the armpit (axillary temperature); a temperature 
higher than 37.2&deg;C (99.0&deg;F) means a fever</li> 
<li>using an ear thermometer (tympanic temperature); a temperature higher than 
38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) means a fever</li> </ul> 
<h2>What causes fever?</h2> 
<p>Many different infections can cause a fever. To find out what is causing 
your child's fever, the doctor will look at other signs or symptoms of the 
illness, not the fever itself. How high a fever is does not help the doctor to 
decide whether an infection is mild or severe, or whether an infection is from 
a bacterial or viral illness.</p> 
<p>Fever may also be caused by other conditions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A mild increase in body temperature can occur with exercise or too much 
clothing, after a hot bath or shower, or in hot weather.</li> 
<li>Rarely, heat stroke or exposure to certain medicines or drugs can cause a 
severe and possibly dangerous increase in body temperature.</li> 
<li>Vaccinations can cause fever. </li> 
<li>Some non-infectious illnesses and some other chronic diseases can cause 
recurrent or persistent fevers.</li> </ul> 
<p>Many people believe that teething causes fever. The available published 
evidence suggests that teething does not cause fever or may be slightly 
associated only with a very mild fever. Teething certainly does not cause high 
fevers.</p> 
<p>If your child's doctor has told you what he thinks is causing your child's 
fever, write it here:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>What to expect when your child has a fever</h2> 
<p>Fevers can make children feel uncomfortable. Usually, these symptoms are 
mild and the child may be slightly cranky or have aches and pains. Some 
children are less active and more sleepy. Some fevers may be associated with 
shaking (chills or rigors) as the body temperature is changing. This type of 
shaking is one way for the body to try to regulate the temperature. It is not a 
seizure or convulsion, and is not associated with changes in the child's level 
of consciousness.</p> 
<p>Approximately 5% of children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years may 
have a shaking episode called a seizure or convulsion associated with a fever. 
These are called febrile seizures or febrile convulsions. Your child should see 
a doctor after a febrile seizure, but febrile seizures are generally not 
dangerous. Typical febrile seizures do not cause brain damage.</p> 
<p>For more information, please see &quot;Febrile Seizures.&quot;</p> 
<p>How often the fever recurs and how long the fever lasts depend mostly on 
the type of infection causing the fever. Most fevers with viruses last for 2 to 
3 days, but sometimes they can last as long as 2 weeks. When the fever is 
caused by a bacterial infection, it may continue until the child is treated 
with an antibiotic medicine.</p> 
<h2>Taking care of your child with a fever</h2> 
<h3>Clothing</h3> 
<p>Keep your child lightly dressed. Most body heat is lost through the skin, 
so overdressing or bundling your child may result in a higher fever and can 
make your child more uncomfortable. If your child is having chills or shivers, 
give her a light blanket. Keep the room temperature at a level that is 
comfortable for you, when lightly dressed.</p> 
<h3>Extra fluids</h3> 
<p>Fever will make your child's body lose slightly more fluid (liquid), so 
encourage your child to drink extra fluids. Cool water or drinks may be 
helpful, but it does not really matter whether the drinks are warm or cool.</p> 
<h3>Sponging</h3> 
<p>Sponging is usually not necessary to help lower body temperature, and may 
make your child more uncomfortable. Sponging may just cool the outside of your 
child's body and cause her to shiver, without really affecting the internal 
body temperature. Use sponging only in these situations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>if it helps to make your child more comfortable </li> 
<li>in emergencies such as heat stroke or very high fever over 42&deg;C 
(108&deg;F)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Medicine</h3> 
<p>Medicine can help to reduce the fever. Medicines may only reduce the fever 
by 1&deg;C to 2&deg;C (2&deg;F to 3&deg;F), and may not bring the temperature 
down to normal. Fevers may also cycle up and down on their own, so it is not 
always easy to tell whether a fever is reduced because of medicine or because 
of the natural fever pattern. If your child is sleeping comfortably, it is not 
necessary to wake her up to give these medicines.</p> 
<p>Two types of medicines are usually recommended for managing fever. They are:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra, Abenol, drug store and other brands) </li> 
<li>ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Brufen, drug store and other brands) </li> </ul> 
<p>They are both available in tablets, capsules, and liquid formulations of 
various strengths. Acetaminophen is also available as a rectal suppository.</p> 
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist can help you decide on the most appropriate 
formulation and strength for your child. The correct dose for a child is based 
on body weight. An estimated dose is usually provided on the medicine package.
</p> 
<p>These medicines are used to help manage the fever and to make your child 
more comfortable, but they do not treat the underlying cause of the fever.</p> 
<p>If your baby is less than 3 months old, do not give any fever medicines 
unless your doctor says so.</p> 
<p>Acetaminophen and ibuprofen do not interact with each other. They may be 
equally effective in lowering a temperature. At different times, it may seem 
that one will work better than the other, or neither will work, or both.</p> 
<p>If your child has a pre-existing medical condition or is already taking 
other medicines, talk to your child's doctor to make sure that acetaminophen or 
ibuprofen is safe for your child.</p> 
<h3>Do not use ASA (Aspirin) to treat your child's fever</h3> 
<p>Although rare, ASA (acetylsalicylic acid or Aspirin) has been linked to a 
severe condition called Reye's syndrome. Do not give ASA to a child to manage a 
fever unless your doctor has specifically told you to give it. You may need to 
check the label of other medicines or ask your pharmacist to make sure that 
they do not contain ASA.</p> 
<h2>When to call your child's health care provider</h2> 
<p>Call your child's doctor or go to a clinic or emergency department right 
away if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your child is less than 3 months old </li> 
<li>you have recently returned from travelling abroad </li> 
<li>the fever is over 40&deg;C (104&deg;F) </li> 
<li>your child develops a rash that looks like small purple dots that do not 
go away when you apply pressure with your fingers (blanching)</li> 
<li>your child is not able to keep down any fluids and appears dehydrated </li>
<li>your child's skin looks very pale or grey, or is cool or mottled </li> 
<li>your child is having constant pain </li> 
<li>your child is lethargic (very weak) or difficult to wake up </li> 
<li>your child has a stiff neck </li> 
<li>your child has a seizure associated with fever </li> 
<li>your child is looking or acting very sick </li> 
<li>your child seems constantly confused or delirious </li> 
<li>your child constantly does not use an arm or a leg normally or refuses to 
stand or put weight on legs</li> 
<li>your child has problems breathing </li> 
<li>your child cries constantly and cannot be settled </li> </ul> 
<p>Call within 24 hours if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your child is between 3 and 6 months old </li> 
<li>your child has specific pain, such as ear or throat pain that may require 
evaluation</li> 
<li>your child has had a fever for more than 3 days </li> 
<li>the fever went away for over 24 hours and then came back </li> 
<li>your child has a bacterial infection that is being treated with an 
antibiotic, but the fever is not going away after 2 to 3 days of starting the 
antibiotic</li> 
<li>your child cries when going to the bathroom </li> 
<li>your child's urine smells bad </li> 
<li>you have other concerns or questions </li> </ul> 
<h2>Fever: Myths and facts</h2> 
<p>There are many myths about fever, and some of these myths may make you 
worry unnecessarily. If your child has a fever, the most important thing is how 
your child looks and acts.</p> 
<h3>Myth: The exact number of the temperature is useful</h3> 
<p>Fact: This number may be useful in deciding care in very young babies or 
children with certain chronic medical conditions. However, the most important 
part of assessing a child with fever is how the child looks and acts, 
especially after treating the fever with medicine. A child who appears well but 
has a high temperature, for example, is less concerning than a child who only 
has a mild fever, but who appears quite unwell or is not responsive. Some minor 
viral illnesses may have high fevers associated with them, and some serious 
bacterial infections may be associated with an abnormally low body temperature.
</p> 
<h3>Myth: Fevers cause brain damage</h3> 
<p>Fact: Most fevers associated with infections are less than 42&deg;C 
(108&deg;F). These fevers do not cause brain damage. Only persistent body 
temperatures greater than 44&deg;C (110&deg;F) can cause brain damage. These 
body temperatures are more likely to occur with heat stroke or after exposure 
to certain street drugs or medicines, such as anaesthetic or some psychiatric 
medicines. They are not likely to occur with the usual infections that children 
can have.</p> 
<h3>Myth: Fevers are bad for children</h3> 
<p>Fact: A fever is just a sign that the body's defense system has been 
activated. Fevers themselves may help to fight infections because many germs do 
not survive as well at slightly higher body temperatures. In this sense, 
although the child may be uncomfortable, most fevers have a beneficial effect 
and may help the body fight infection. The main reason to use medicine to 
decrease fever is to make the child feel better.</p> 
<h3>Myth: Fevers should always respond to an anti-fever medicine</h3> 
<p>Fact: Anti-fever medicine usually helps to bring the fever down, but this 
is not always so. Sometimes a fever continues even after giving the medicine. 
Whether or not the medicine works to reduce the fever has no relationship with 
the seriousness of the infection.</p> 
<h3>Myth: Fevers should respond quickly to antibiotic medicine</h3> 
<p>Fact: Antibiotics are only useful in treating bacterial infections. They 
have no effect on viral infections. Most infections are caused by viruses, so 
an antibiotic will have no effect on them. For bacterial infections, the 
antibiotic will start working to fight the bacteria as soon as it is given, but 
it may take a few days before the fever goes away.</p> 
<h2>Key points</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Fever is usually a sign that the body is fighting an infection. </li> 
<li>Your child's exact temperature is less important than how your child looks 
and acts.</li> 
<li>To keep your child comfortable, do not dress your child too warmly, give 
extra fluids, and give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</li> </ul> <br>
