<h1>How to Get Rid of a Fever </h1> <br>
 August 18th, 2007 
<p>A fever, except in very infrequent circumstances, is merely a natural 
response by your immune system to infection. It isn't necessarily a bad thing 
at all. It most likely just means that your body is functioning the way it 
should. Now there are a few situations where a fever is something that you 
should worry about, like with newborns, children, and elderly people. This is 
especially true if the fever is accompanied by one of the symptoms from the 
list on the right. The rest of the article goes into greater detail about those 
situations.</p> 
<p>One major threat posed by fevers is permanent brain damage caused by a very 
high fever. This is called hyperpyrexia, and it happens when your fever is over 
106.7&ordm; F. But you should already be at the doctor when your fever goes 
over 103&ordm; F. And doctors can deal with fevers quite well. At home, fevers 
are more of a nuisance than a threat. The key is to get rest and stay hydrated. 
And if reducing a child's fever, it is absolutely necessary use ibuprofen, not 
aspirin. Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 18 years of age.</p> <br>

<h2>Fever Treatments</h2> 
<p><strong>Fever in a newborn. </strong>A fever in a newborn is a rectal 
temperature of more than 100.4&ordm; F or an underarm (axillary) temperature 
over 98.6&ordm; F. Doctors used to recommend taking a newborn's temperature 
rectally and some might still, but call your doctor's office to find out. Ask 
them for directions, if they want a rectal temperature. Otherwise, if you're 
taking your newborn's temperature on your own, try taking it under their arm. 
There are thermometers available for purchase that are specifically made for 
taking underarm temperatures in newborns and children. Otherwise, use an oral 
thermometer&mdash;place the thermometer in your baby's armpit and hold their 
arm down with the thermometer underneath until the reading is complete. Fevers 
are normally caused by infection, but occasionally in newborns, especially 
premature infants, an infection may not be the cause of a fever. Fevers in 
infants and newborns should always be treated by a doctor.</p> 
<p><strong>Fever in children. </strong>An oral temperature of 99.5&ordm; F or 
a rectal temperature of 100.4&ordm; F is considered a fever in children. Many 
children are capable of tolerating a fever. If the child is responsive, able to 
drink fluids, and wants to play, there probably isn't anything to worry about. 
If the child becomes listless, has a severe headache, has persistent vomiting, 
or has a fever that isn't responding to fever-reducing medication, see a 
doctor. Don't use aspirin to reduce a fever. It has been linked to Reye's 
syndrome. Fevers are serious business, so if you have any concerns about your 
child's well-being, call your doctor.</p> 
<p><strong>Cool down your body.</strong> The trick is to cool the body down 
without causing it to get the chills or go into shock. You may have seen people 
with fevers get ice baths in the movies, but that's an extreme circumstance. A 
more realistic approach would be to take a bath in water that is around 
95&ordm; F. If the person begins to get the chills or shivers, stop the bath. 
Never put an infant in a cool bath. Their bodies are too small to handle the 
extreme temperature change. Otherwise, try a cool, wet cloth on the forehead, 
or an ice pack on the head, groin, or armpits.</p> 
<p><strong>Keep your body hydrated. </strong>Ask a doctor what to do about a 
fever, and that doctor will most likely tell you to keep hydrated and get some 
rest. That is as long as the fever is under 103&ordm; F. If your fever gets 
above 103&ordm; F or if you have a fever for more than three days, see a 
doctor. If your fever hasn't reached either of these levels, drink water with 
electrolytes in it, along with soup broth, Gatorade, Sprite, and plain water 
too. Just don't drink more than a gallon of water in a day. That's too much 
water.</p> 
<p><strong>Tylenol and NSAIDs are fever reducers. </strong>The best fever 
reducer is without a doubt ibuprofen, which is an NSAID, which stands for 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other NSAIDs are naproxen sodium and 
ketoprofen. Aspirin and other salicylates also reduce fever but should never be 
taken by someone under the age of 18. Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, (brand 
name: Tylenol) reduces fever for some people but not all, like myself. Other 
drugs that reduce inflammation are metamizole, nabumetone, nimesulide, and 
phenazone. If you have any questions about whether or not reducing a fever is 
the right thing to do, read the next section.</p> 
<h2>Reducing Fevers vs. Letting Them Run Their Course</h2> 
<p>I am not a doctor, but I think fevers should only be reduced when it is 
absolutely needed. A fever is your body doing what it's supposed to do. Our 
immune system functions much more efficiently at a warmer temperature. And when 
you have an infection, you want your immune system to function as best it can. 
In fact, you want to support it by drinking water and taking vitamins and 
supplements to give your body energy and materials to fight the infection.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, a fever can be very difficult on a child and on us. And 
occasionally relieving a child's fever may give the child a chance to sleep, 
relax, or calm down. It may also give you some reprieve from the illness. But 
it really should only be done when absolutely needed because suppressing our 
immune systems will only keep ourselves sick longer. And no one wants that.</p>

<h3>Fever Emergency</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Temperature over 103&ordm; F </li> 
<li>Temperature of 101&ordm; F for 3 days </li> 
<li>Newborn temperature over 100.4&ordm; F </li> 
<li>Fever accompanied by the following symptoms: 
<blockquote> 
<p> Seizure </p> 
<p>Mental confusion </p> 
<p>Persistent vomiting </p> 
<p>Severe headache </p> 
<p>Extreme listlessness and irritability </p> 
<p>Severely swollen throat </p> 
<p>Bulging soft spot on infant's head </p> 
<p>Labored breathing</p> </blockquote> </li> </ul> 
<h3>Natural Fever Reducers</h3> 
<p><strong>Willow bark</strong> is an ancient cure for aches and fevers. 
Hippocrates wrote of its medicinal properties 2,500 years ago. It was the 
precursor to aspirin, which eventually led to the other NSAIDs.</p> 
<p><strong>Ginger.</strong> Historically, medicinal ginger was called Jamaica 
ginger. Ginger is said to have anti-inflammatory effects. Much research has 
been done, but the jury is still out. Most people make tea from it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rest and lots of liquid.</strong> When all is said and done, 
reducing the fever doesn't really improve your condition. It may make you feel 
better but you are still ill. Try supporting your body's immune system with 
lots of rest and liquids.</p> <br>
