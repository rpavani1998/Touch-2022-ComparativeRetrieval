<h2>What is the most important information I should know about ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p>This medicine can increase your risk of life-threatening heart or 
circulation problems, including heart attack or stroke. This risk will increase 
the longer you use ibuprofen. Do not use this medicine just before or after 
having heart bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).
</p> 
<p>Seek emergency medical help if you have symptoms of heart or circulation 
problems, such as chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or 
problems with vision or balance.</p> 
<p>This medicine can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach 
or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole).</p> 
<p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach 
or intestines. This includes black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up 
blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p> Do not take more of this 
medication than is recommended. An overdose of ibuprofen can cause damage to 
your stomach or intestines. Use only the smallest amount of ibuprofen needed to 
get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever. <br>
<br>

<h2>What is ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p>Ibuprofen is in a group of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs). Ibuprofen works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation 
and pain in the body.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by 
many conditions such as headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual 
cramps, or minor injury.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication 
guide.</p> 
<h2>What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking ibuprofen?
</h2> 
<p>NSAIDs can increase your risk of life-threatening heart or circulation 
problems, including heart attack or stroke. This risk will increase the longer 
you take ibuprofen. Do not use this medicine just before or after having heart 
bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p> 
<p>NSAIDs can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach or 
intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These 
conditions can be fatal and gastrointestinal effects can occur without warning 
at any time while you are taking an NSAID.</p> Do not use this medication if 
you are allergic to ibuprofen, aspirin or other NSAIDs. <br>
<br>

<p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist if it is safe for you to take this medication if 
you have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot;</li> 
<li>heart disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure;</li> 
<li>a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding;</li> 
<li>asthma;</li> 
<li>polyps in your nose;</li> 
<li>liver or kidney disease;</li> 
<li>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE);</li> 
<li>a bleeding or blood clotting disorder; or</li> 
<li>if you smoke.</li> </ul> FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether 
ibuprofen is harmful to an unborn baby.<b>However, taking ibuprofen during the 
last 3 months of pregnancy may result in birth defects.</b> Do not take 
ibuprofen during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to. <br>
<br>
It is 
not known whether ibuprofen passes into breast milk or if it could harm a 
nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if you are 
breast-feeding a baby. <br>
<br>
Do not give this medicine to a child without 
the advice of a doctor. <br>
<br>

<h2>How should I take ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p>Take this medication exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been 
prescribed by your doctor. Do not use the medication in larger amounts, or use 
it for longer than recommended.</p> Do not take more of this medication than is 
recommended. An overdose of ibuprofen can cause damage to your stomach or 
intestines. The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per 
dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). Use only the smallest amount of 
ibuprofen needed to get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever. <br>
<br>

Take ibuprofen with food or milk to lessen stomach upset. <br>
<br>
Shake the 
oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. To be sure you 
get the correct dose, measure the liquid with a marked measuring spoon or 
medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a 
dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one. <br>
<br>

<p>The ibuprofen chewable tablet must be chewed before you swallow it.</p> 
<p>If you take ibuprofen for a long period of time, your doctor may want to 
check you on a regular basis to make sure this medication is not causing 
harmful effects. Do not miss any scheduled visits to your doctor.</p> Store 
ibuprofen at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not allow the 
liquid medicine to freeze. <br>
<br>

<h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2> 
<p>Since ibuprofen is sometimes taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing 
schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as 
soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed 
dose and wait until your next regularly scheduled dose.<b>Do not</b> take extra 
medicine to make up the missed dose.</p> 
<h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2> Seek emergency medical attention if you 
think you have used too much of this medicine. Overdose symptoms may include 
nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, black or bloody stools, coughing up 
blood, shallow breathing, fainting, or coma. <br>
<br>

<h2>What should I avoid while taking ibuprofen?</h2> Avoid taking ibuprofen if 
you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or heart attack. Ibuprofen can make 
aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you must 
use both medications, take the ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes 
after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form). <br>
<br>
Do not use any 
other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medication without first asking 
your doctor or pharmacist. Many medicines available over the counter contain 
aspirin or other medicines similar to ibuprofen (such as ketoprofen or 
naproxen). If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too 
much of this type of medication. Read the label of any other medicine you are 
using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen. <br>

<br> Do not drink alcohol while taking ibuprofen. Alcohol can increase the risk 
of stomach bleeding caused by ibuprofen. <br>
<br>

<h2>What are the possible side effects of ibuprofen?</h2> Get emergency 
medical help if you have any of these<b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> 
hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. 
<br> <br>
Stop taking ibuprofen and seek medical attention or call your doctor 
at once if you have any of these serious side effects: <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, problems with 
vision or balance;</li> 
<li>black, bloody, or tarry stools, coughing up blood or vomit that looks like 
coffee grounds;</li> 
<li>swelling or rapid weight gain;</li> 
<li>urinating less than usual or not at all;</li> 
<li>nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, 
clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes);</li> 
<li>fever, sore throat, and headache with a severe blistering, peeling, and 
red skin rash;</li> 
<li>bruising, severe tingling, numbness, pain, muscle weakness; or</li> 
<li>severe headache, neck stiffness, chills, increased sensitivity to light, 
and/or seizure (convulsions).</li> </ul> 
<p>Less serious side effects may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>upset stomach, mild heartburn, diarrhea, constipation;</li> 
<li>bloating, gas;</li> 
<li>dizziness, headache, nervousness;</li> 
<li>skin itching or rash;</li> 
<li>blurred vision; or</li> 
<li>ringing in your ears.</li> </ul> 
<p>This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your 
doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to 
FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p> 
<h2>What other drugs will affect ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking an antidepressant such as citalopram 
(Celexa), duloxetine (Cymbalta), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, 
Sarafem, Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline 
(Zoloft), or venlafaxine (Effexor). Taking any of these drugs with ibuprofen 
may cause you to bruise or bleed easily.</p> 
<p>Before taking ibuprofen, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the 
following drugs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>aspirin or other NSAIDs such as diclofenac (Voltaren), etodolac (Lodine), 
indomethacin (Indocin), meloxicam (Mobic), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), 
piroxicam (Feldene), and others;</li> 
<li>an ACE inhibitor such as benazepril (Lotensin), fosinopril (Monopril), 
enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), quinapril (Accupril), 
ramipril (Altace), and others;</li> 
<li>lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid);</li> 
<li>diuretics (water pills) such as furosemide (Lasix);</li> 
<li>methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall);</li> 
<li>steroids (prednisone and others); or</li> 
<li>a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin).</li> </ul> 
<p>This list is not complete and there may be other drugs that can interact 
with ibuprofen. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and 
over-the-counter medications you use. This includes vitamins, minerals, herbal 
products, and drugs prescribed by other doctors. Do not start using a new 
medication without telling your doctor.</p>
