<b>Question: </b>Do Fevers Cause Brain 
Damage? 
<p>It has long been believed that high fevers can cause brain damage, 
especially if left untreated. So how much truth is there to this claim? It 
really depends on the situation.</p> <b>Answer: </b> 
<p>Most fevers are caused by viral or bacterial infections, but they can also 
be caused by toxins, cancers or autoimmune diseases. A fever is just a symptom 
of illness, not an illness itself. When an otherwise healthy person has a fever 
because of an illness, it is extremely unlikely to cause brain damage. Even
febrile seizures, which occur in children, do not cause any permanent damage. 
</p> 
<p>The time to be concerned about a high fever is when it is not caused by an 
illness, but because of overheating. This is actually heat stroke 
(hyperthermia), which is completely different than a fever. Hyperthermia can be 
caused by overexposure to high temperatures and under consumption of water. In 
these cases, the body may not be able to regulate its temperature, and 
medications will not bring the temperature down. Brain and organ damage usually 
occur because of hyperthermia.</p> 
<h3>When to Be Concerned</h3> 
<p>Even if you or your child have not been exposed to high temperatures, and 
hyperthermia is not a concern, there are several other factors that play into 
deciding what to do about a fever.</p> 
<p> In young children, it is broken down by age: </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Under 3 months: Call a doctor for any rectal temperature over 100.2 
degrees.</li> 
<li>3 to 6 months: Call a doctor for any rectal temp over 101. </li> 
<li>6 to 12 months: Call a doctor for any rectal temp over 103.</li> </ul> 
<p>In children over 12 months and adults, there are other things to consider. 
Some situations that warrant calling a doctor include:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>A child under age 2 who has a fever for over 24 to 48 hours </li> 
<li>A fever that lasts longer than 48 to 72 hours in older children and adults 
</li> 
<li>A fever over 105 degrees, which could indicate a more serious illness </li>
<li>Presence of other concerning symptoms such as a stiff neck, confusion, 
difficulty breathing, or a first-time seizure</li> 
<li>Presence of other symptoms that make you think an illness may need to be 
treated, such as a sore throat, earache or cough</li> 
<li>You think you may have incorrectly dosed medication, or you aren&rsquo;t 
sure what dose to give</li> </ul> 
<h3>What to Do for Fevers Caused by Illness</h3> 
<p>Generally, treatment is going to be based on how the person is feeling and 
acting. Fevers are actually helpful when the body has an infection because they 
make it more difficult for germs to live and multiply. The fever is actually 
your body&rsquo;s natural way of fighting off the illness. The purpose of 
treating a fever is just to make the person more comfortable, not to eliminate 
the fever completely.</p> 
<p>If an adult or child has a fever but feels okay, and is still able to 
perform daily activities or play, there is no reason to treat the fever. 
However, if the person is not feeling well enough to get out of bed or play, 
then it is fine to treat the fever with medication.</p> 
<p>The most common and effective medications to treat fevers are: </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tylenol (acetaminophen)<br>
 Tylenol is approved for use in children as 
young as 2 months old, but should never be given to a child under 3 months 
without first speaking to a doctor.</li> 
<li>Advil or Motrin (ibuprofen)<br>
 Ibuprofen is approved for use in children 
as young as 6 months.</li> 
<li>Aspirin <br>
 Aspirin should never be given to children under 18 years of 
age, unless specifically recommended by a doctor, because of the risk of a rare 
but possibly fatal illness calledReye&rsquo;s Syndrome.</li> </ul> 
<p>A lukewarm bath may be helpful, but should only be tried after medication 
has been given to prevent the temperature from rapidly rising after getting out 
of the water. If a bath makes your child uncomfortable or unhappy, it is 
unnecessary.</p> 
<p>If a child has a fever and does not feel better about an hour after taking 
acetaminophen or ibuprofen (regardless of whether or not the temperature goes 
down), call his healthcare provider.</p> 
<p>There are also other things you can do to help a person cope with a fever. 
Some tips:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep the person dressed lightly </li> 
<li>Encourage her to stay well hydrated &ndash;- drinking plenty of fluids can 
naturally cool the body and help prevent dehydration</li> 
<li>Do not bundle someone who has the chills and do not use cold baths or 
alcohol rubs. These can all raise the core temperature of the body, making the 
person feel worse, not better.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Treating Hyperthermia</h3> 
<p>If the high temperature is caused by overheating, heat exhaustion or heat 
stroke, treatment is very different.</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Remove the person from the warm area. </li> 
<li>Sponge the person with cool water. </li> 
<li>Place ice packs in the armpits, behind the neck and in the groin area. 
</li> 
<li>Give cool fluids if the person is alert (never try to hydrate a person who 
is unconscious). If you are concerned that someone is overheated and they are 
unconscious, call 911 immediately.</li> 
<li>Seek medical attention, even if the person is awake. </li> 
<li>Do not give medications, they may not help and could even be harmful.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> Fevers can be scary, especially for parents who just 
want their children to feel better. However, not every case of fever warrants 
worry. The only time the body will sustain damage due to a high temperature is 
when the body temperature goes over 107.6 degrees. Unless the fever is caused 
by an outside source (hyperthermia) or there is already a neurological problem, 
there is almost no chance that the temperature will go this high.
