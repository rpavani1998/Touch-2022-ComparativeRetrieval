<p>There are several types of medications available for pain relief and to 
reduce fevers. If you need help deciding which over the counter pain reliever 
or fever reducer is right for you and your symptoms, you have come to the right 
place. Find out what your options are and the pros and cons to each pain 
reliever and fever reducer.</p> 
<h3>1. Tylenol (acetaminophen)</h3> 
<p>Tylenol is considered the safest pain reliever and fever reducer available. 
It is available for use in children as young as 2 months old. However, it can 
cause liver damage if too much is taken or you have certain diseases. Find out 
if Tylenol is right for you and your symptoms.</p> <br>

<h3>2. Advil or Motrin (ibuprofen)</h3> 
<p>Advil and Motrin are both brand names for ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In English, that means that it 
helps reduce swelling (and pain) but it is not a steroid. Ibuprofen is great 
for sore muscles, sore throats and can also be very effective at bringing down 
fevers. Find out if ibuprofen is right for you.</p> <br>

<h3>3. Aleve (naproxen)</h3> 
<p>Aleve is the brand name for naproxen. Naproxen is another NSAID, similar to 
ibuprofen. Naproxen works differently than ibuprofen, but it has the same 
effect. Both are effective pain relievers and fever reducers. Find out if Aleve 
is right for you.</p> 
<h3>4. Aspirin</h3> 
<p>Aspirin can be an effective pain reliever and fever reducer. It is sold 
under many brand names, including Bayer and Ecotrin. Aspirin not only relieves 
pain, fevers and swelling, it also reduces the blood's ability to clot. Many 
people take low doses of aspirin to prevent heart attacks and stroke.<br>
<b>
Aspirin should never be given to a child or teenager because it may cause a 
potentially fatal disease known as Reye's syndrome.</b> </p>
