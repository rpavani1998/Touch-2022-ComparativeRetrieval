 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
rheumatoid arthritis. Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>New Drug Treatment Guidelines</strong></p> 
<p>In 2008, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) released new guidelines 
for the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DMARDs include nonbiologic and biologic 
drugs. This is the first ACR drug guidelines since 2002. Biologic DMARDs were 
not included in previous treatment guidelines.</p> 
<p>The ACR's current recommendations include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) or leflunomide (Arava) as initial therapy for 
most patients with RA</li> 
<li>Methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) for patients with 
moderate-to-high disease activity</li> 
<li>Methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine plus sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) for 
patients with poor prognostic features and moderate-to-high levels of disease 
activity.</li> 
<li>For patients with early RA (less than 3 months), anti-tumor necrosis 
factor (anti-TNF) biologic drugs (along with methotrexate) should be reserved 
only for patients with high disease activity who have never received DMARDs. 
For longer duration RA, anti-TNF drugs are recommended for patients who have 
not been helped by methotrexate. The three approved anti-TNF DMARDs are 
etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), and adalimumab (Humira).</li> 
<li>The biologic DMARDs abatacept (Orencia)and rituximab (Rituxan) should be 
reserved for patients with at least moderate disease activity and poor disease 
prognosis who were not helped by methotrexate and other nonbiologic DMARDs.</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Drug Warnings</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>In 2008, the FDA alerted health care professionals to monitor patients 
taking anti-TNF drugs for signs of opportunistic infections, particularly 
fungal infections and tuberculosis.</li> 
<li>The FDA is investigating the possible association between use of anti-TNF 
drugs and the occurrence of lymphomas and other cancers in children and young 
adults who took these drugs for treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
<li>Etanercept's prescribing label now includes a stronger warning about the 
risks of infections, including tuberculosis.</li> 
<li>Rituxan's label now includes updated information on the risks for 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and deadly brain 
infection.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Introduction 
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease in which various joints in 
the body are inflamed, leading to swelling, pain, stiffness, and the possible 
loss of function.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The process may develop in the following way:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The disease process leading to rheumatoid arthritis begins in the <i>
synovium</i>, the membrane that surrounds a joint and creates a protective sac.
</li> 
<li>This sac is filled with lubricating liquid called the <i>synovial fluid.
</i> In addition to cushioning joints, this fluid supplies nutrients and oxygen 
to<i>cartilage</i>, a slippery tissue that coats the ends of bones.</li> 
<li>Cartilage is composed primarily of <i>collagen</i>, the structural protein 
in the body, which forms a mesh to give support and flexibility to joints.</li> 
<li>In rheumatoid arthritis, an abnormal immune system response produces 
destructive molecules that cause continuous inflammation of the synovium. 
Collagen is gradually destroyed, narrowing the joint space and eventually 
damaging bone.</li> 
<li>If the disease develops into a form called progressive rheumatoid 
arthritis, destruction to the cartilage accelerates. Fluid and immune system 
cells accumulate in the synovium to produce a<i>pannus</i>, a growth composed 
of thickened synovial tissue.</li> 
<li>The pannus produces more enzymes that destroy nearby cartilage, 
aggravating the area and attracting more inflammatory white cells, thereby 
perpetuating the process.</li> </ul> 
<p>This inflammatory process not only affects cartilage and bones but can also 
harm organs in other parts of the body.</p> Click the icon to see an image of

<br>
Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>The exact causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis 
is most likely triggered by a combination of factors, including an abnormal 
autoimmune response, genetic susceptibility, and some environmental or biologic 
trigger, such as a viral infection or hormonal changes.</p> 
<h3>The Immune Response and Inflammatory Process</h3> 
<p><em>The Normal Immune System Response.</em> The inflammatory process is a 
byproduct of the activity of the body's immune system, which fights infection 
and heals wounds and injuries:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When an injury or an infection occurs, white blood cells are mobilized to 
rid the body of any foreign proteins, such as a virus.</li> 
<li>The masses of blood cells that gather at the injured or infected site 
produce factors to repair wounds, clot the blood, and fight any infections.</li>
<li>In the process the surrounding area becomes inflamed and some healthy 
tissue is injured. The immune system is then called upon to repair wounds by 
clotting off any bleeding blood vessel and initiating fiber-like patches to the 
tissue.</li> 
<li>Under normal conditions, the immune system has other special factors that 
control and limit this inflammatory process.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>The Infection Fighters.</em> Two important components of the immune 
system that play a role in the inflammation associated with rheumatoid 
arthritis are<em>B cells</em> and <em>T cells</em>, both of which belong to a 
family of immune cells called lymphocytes.</p> 
<p>If the T cell recognizes an antigen as &quot;non-self,&quot; it will 
produce chemicals (cytokines) that cause B cells to multiply and release many 
immune proteins (antibodies). These antibodies circulate widely in the 
bloodstream, recognizing the foreign particles and triggering inflammation in 
order to rid the body of the invasion.</p> 
<p>For reasons that are still not completely understood, both the T cells and 
the B cells become overactive in patients with RA.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Genetic Factors</h3> 
<p>Genetic factors may play some role in RA either in terms of increasing 
susceptibility to developing the condition or by worsening the disease process 
but are clearly not the only important factors. The main genetic marker 
identified with rheumatoid arthritis is HLA (human leukocyte antigen).</p> 
<p>A number of HLA genetic forms called HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DR4 alleles are 
referred to as the RA-shared epitope because of their association with 
rheumatoid arthritis. These genetic factors do not cause RA, but they may make 
the disease more severe once it has developed. Genetic variations in the HLA 
region may also predict drug treatment response to etanercept and the 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug methotrexate.</p> 
<h3>Environmental Triggers</h3> 
<p><i>Infections.</i> Although many bacteria and viruses have been studied, no 
single organism has been proven to be the primary trigger for the autoimmune 
response and subsequent damaging inflammation. Higher than average levels of 
antibodies that react with the common intestinal bacteria<i>E. coli</i> have 
appeared in the synovial fluid of people with RA. Some researchers think they 
may stimulate the immune system to prolong RA once the disease has been 
triggered by some other initial infection. Other potential triggers include 
Mycoplasma, parvovirus B19, retroviruses, mycobacteria, and Epstein-Barr virus.
</p> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>According to the Arthritis Foundation, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 
about 1.3 million Americans.</p> 
<h3>Age</h3> 
<p>Although rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age from childhood to old 
age, onset usually begins between the ages of 30 - 50.</p> 
<h3>Gender</h3> 
<p>Women are more likely to develop RA than men.</p> 
<h3>Family History</h3> 
<p>Some people may inherit genes that make them more susceptible to developing 
RA, but a family history of RA does not appear to increase an individual's risk.
</p> 
<h3>Smoking</h3> 
<p>Heavy long-term smoking is a very strong risk factor for RA, particularly 
in patients without a family history of the disease.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Symptoms 
<p>The hallmark symptom of rheumatoid arthritis is morning stiffness that 
lasts for at least an hour. (Stiffness from osteoarthritis, for instance, 
usually clears up within half an hour.) Even after remaining motionless for a 
few moments, the body can stiffen. Movement becomes easier again after 
loosening up.</p> 
<h3>Swelling and Pain</h3> 
<p>Swelling and pain in the joints must occur for at least 6 weeks before a 
diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is considered. The inflamed joints are 
usually swollen and often feel warm and &quot;boggy&quot; when touched. The 
pain often occurs symmetrically but may be more severe on one side of the body, 
depending on which hand the person uses more often.</p> 
<h3>Specific Joints Affected</h3> 
<p>Although rheumatoid arthritis almost always develops in the wrists and 
knuckles, the knees and joints of the ball of the foot are often affected as 
well. Indeed, many joints may be involved, including those in the cervical 
spine, shoulders, elbows, tips, temporomandibular joint (jaw), and even joints 
between very small bones in the inner ear. Rheumatoid arthritis does not 
usually show up in the fingertips, where osteoarthritis is common, but joints 
at the base of the fingers are often painful.</p> 
<h3>Nodules</h3> 
<p>In about 20% of people with RA, inflammation of small blood vessels can 
cause nodules, or lumps, under the skin. They are about the size of a pea or 
slightly larger, and are often located near the elbow, although they can show 
up anywhere. Nodules can occur throughout the course of the disease. Rarely, 
nodules may become sore and infected, particularly if they are in locations 
where stress occurs, such as the ankles. On rare occasions, nodules can reflect 
the presence of rheumatoid vasculitis, a condition that can affect blood 
vessels in the lungs, kidneys, or other organs.</p> 
<h3>Fluid Buildup</h3> 
<p>Fluid may accumulate, particularly in the ankles. In some cases, the joint 
sac behind the knee accumulates fluid and forms what is known as a Baker cyst. 
This cyst feels like a tumor and sometimes extends down the back of the calf 
causing pain. Baker cysts often develop in people who do not have RA.</p> 
<h3>Flu-Like Symptoms</h3> 
<p>Symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and fever may accompany early 
rheumatoid arthritis. Some people describe them as being similar to those of a 
cold or flu except, of course, RA symptoms can last for years.</p> 
<h3>Symptoms in Children</h3> 
<p>In children, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, also known as Still's disease, 
is usually preceded by high fever and shaking chills along with pain and 
swelling in many joints. A pink skin rash may be present.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Complications 
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is not fatal, but complications of the disease may 
shorten survival by a few years in some individuals. Although type 2 rheumatoid 
arthritis is progressive and there is no cure, over time the disease becomes 
less aggressive, and symptoms may even improve.</p> 
<p>Treatments for RA are increasingly effective in slowing this debilitating 
disease, and some may even prevent initial destruction by aggressively reducing 
inflammation. If bone and ligament destruction and any deformities have 
occurred, however, the effects are permanent. It is essential, therefore, to 
seek a doctor's help as soon as symptoms develop. Side effects of the 
treatments often contribute to the severity of the disease.</p> 
<h3>Effect of Joint Disability and Pain on Daily Life</h3> 
<p>Affected joints can become deformed, and the performance of even ordinary 
tasks may be very difficult or impossible. According to one survey, 70% of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis feel the disease prevents them from living a 
fully productive life.</p> 
<h3>Complications in Other Areas of the Body</h3> 
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis can affect other parts of the body as well as the 
joints. Some patients with severe disease may then be at higher risk for 
complications, such as the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Peripheral Neuropathy</em>. This condition affects the nerves, most 
often those in the hands and feet. It can result in tingling, numbness, or 
burning.</li> 
<li><em>Muscle problems.</em> Many patients have weakness of the muscles.</li> 
<li><em>Anemia</em>. People with RA may develop anemia, which involves a 
decrease in the number of red blood cells.</li> 
<li><em>Scleritis and Episcleritis</em>. This is an inflammation of the blood 
vessels in the eye that can result in corneal damage. Symptoms include redness 
of the eye and a gritty sensation.</li> 
<li><em>Infections</em>. Patients with RA have a higher risk for infections, 
particularly if they are treated only with immune-suppressing drugs 
(corticosteroids, anti-tumor necrosis factors, disease modifying drugs).</li> 
<li><em>Skin Problems</em>. Skin problems are common, particularly on the 
fingers and under the nails. Some patients develop severe skin complications 
that include rash, ulcers, blisters (which may bleed in some cases), lumps 
under the skin, and other problems. Severe skin disease can reflects a more 
serious case of RA in general.</li> 
<li><em>Osteoporosis</em>. Osteoporosis, a disorder in which bone density 
decreases, is more common than average in postmenopausal women with RA. The hip 
is particularly affected. The risk for osteoporosis also appears to be higher 
than average in men with RA who are over 60 years old.</li> 
<li><em>Lung Disease</em>. Patients with RA are susceptible to chronic lung 
diseases, including interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and other 
problems. Both rheumatoid arthritis itself and some treatments may cause this 
damage.</li> 
<li><em>Kidney</em>. Although rheumatoid arthritis only rarely involves the 
kidney, many of the drugs used to treat it can damage kidneys.</li> 
<li><em>Vasculitis</em>. Vasculitis involves autoimmune inflammatory 
abnormalities in very small vessels and can affect many organs in the body. 
Manifestations of vasculitis include mouth ulcers, nerve disorders, rapid 
worsening of the lungs, inflammation of coronary arteries, and inflammation of 
the arteries supplying blood to the intestines.</li> 
<li><em>Heart Disease</em>. Patients with RA have increased risk for death 
from coronary artery disease. Research suggests that he chronic inflammation 
associated with RA may be a factor.</li> 
<li><em>Lymphoma and Other Cancers</em>. Patients with RA are more likely than 
healthy patients to develop non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. RA's chronic inflammatory 
process may play a role in the development of lymphoma. There has also been 
concern that some RA treatments may increase the risk for lymphoma.</li> 
<li><em>Periodontal Disease</em>. People with RA may be twice as likely as 
non-arthritic individuals to have periodontal disease. Chronic inflammation and 
immune dysfunction are central to both diseases.</li> 
<li><em>Pregnancy</em>. Women with RA have an increased risk for premature 
delivery. They are also three times more likely than healthy women to develop 
hypertension during the last trimester of pregnancy. For many women with RA, 
the disease goes into remission during pregnancy but after birth the condition 
recurs and symptoms can increase in severity.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Severity of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3> 
<p>Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis often resolves before adulthood. Patients who 
experience arthritis in only a few joints do better than those with more 
widespread (systemic) disease, which is very difficult to treat. Although it 
can be very serious, very few people die from this condition.</p> 
<p><i>MAS.</i> Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening 
complication of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and requires immediate treatment 
with high-dose steroids and cyclosporin A. Parents should be aware of symptoms, 
which include persistent fever, weakness, drowsiness, and lethargy.</p> Back to 
Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose. Many other conditions 
resemble it and its symptoms can develop insidiously. Blood tests and x-rays 
may show normal results for months after the onset of joint pain. Even after 
rheumatoid arthritis has been diagnosed, it is extremely important to determine 
whether the course of the disease is benign (type 1) or aggressive (type 2) in 
order to treat the problem appropriately.</p> 
<p>Specific findings or presentation more likely to suggest the diagnosis of 
rheumatoid arthritis include morning stiffness, involvement of three joints at 
the same time, involvement of both sides of the body, subcutaneous nodules, 
positive rheumatoid factor, changes in x-rays.</p> 
<h3>Blood Tests</h3> 
<p>Various blood tests may be used to help diagnose RA, determine its 
severity, and detect complications of the disease.</p> 
<p><i>Rheumatoid Factor.</i> In RA, antibodies that collect in the synovium of 
the joint are known as<em>rheumatoid factor</em>. In about 80% of cases of RA, 
blood tests reveal rheumatoid factor. It can also show up in blood tests of 
people with other diseases. However, when it appears in patients with arthritic 
pain on both sides of the body, it is a strong indicator of type 2 RA. The 
presence of rheumatoid factor plus evidence of bone damage on x-rays also 
suggests a significant chance for progressive joint damage.</p> 
<p><i>Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Test.</i> An erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR or sed rate) measures how fast red blood cells (erythrocytes) fall to 
the bottom of a fine glass tube that is filled with the patient's blood. The 
higher the sed rate the greater the inflammation. However, the sed rate can be 
high in many conditions ranging from infection to inflammation to tumors. The 
test is used, then, not for diagnosis, but to help determine how active the 
condition is.</p> 
<p><i>C-Reactive Protein.</i> High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are also 
indicators of active inflammation. However, because obesity also increases CRP 
levels, the doctor should consider a patient's body mass index when evaluating 
CRP levels during RA diagnosis.</p> 
<p><i>Anti-CCP Antibody Test.</i> The presence of antibodies to cyclic 
citrullinated peptides (CCP) can identify RA years before symptoms develop. In 
combination with the test for rheumatoid factor, the CCP antibody test is the 
best predictor of which patients will go on to develop severe RA.</p> 
<p><i>Tests for Anemia.</i> Anemia is a common complication. Blood tests are 
needed often to determine the amount of red blood cells (hemoglobin and 
hematocrit) and iron (soluble transferrin receptor and serum ferritin) in the 
blood.</p> 
<h3>Possible RA Markers in Synovial Fluid</h3> 
<p>Analyzing the synovial fluid might prove to be helpful in detecting markers 
of joint destruction<strong>,</strong> but this is not commonly performed.</p> 
<h3>Imaging Techniques</h3> 
<p><i>X-Rays.</i> X-rays generally have not been helpful to detect the 
presence of early rheumatoid arthritis because they cannot show images of soft 
tissue.</p> 
<p><em>Dexa Scans</em>. The use of a technique known as dual energy x-ray 
absorptiometry, however, may be useful in detecting early bone loss in 
rheumatoid arthritis (2 - 27 months after onset). Evidence of damage on x-rays 
along with elevated rheumatoid factor is a significant predictor for 
progressive joint destruction.</p> 
<p><i>Ultrasound.</i> Special ultrasound techniques called power Doppler 
ultrasonography (PDUS) or quantitative ultrasound (QUS) may be helpful in RA. 
PDUS may be reliable for monitoring inflammatory activity in the joint. QUS, 
which is used for osteoporosis, can detect bone loss in fingers, which may 
prove to be a good indicator of early RA.</p> 
<p><i>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</i> Specially designed magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) equipment called extremity MRI may be able detect bone erosions 
in the hands of RA patients where x-rays cannot. Further evaluation is 
necessary.</p> 
<h3>Disorders with Similar Symptoms</h3> 
<p>Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be mimicked by things as benign as a 
bad mattress or as serious as cancer. A number of rare genetic diseases attack 
the joints. Physical injuries, infections, and poor circulation are among the 
many problems that can cause aches and pains. It would be impossible to discuss 
in this report the dozens of all conditions with symptoms of joint aches and 
pains.</p> 
<p><i>Osteoarthritis.</i> Osteoarthritis requires some special mention because 
it is the most common form of arthritis. It differs from RA in several 
important respects.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Osteoarthritis usually occurs in older people.</li> 
<li>It is located in only one or a few joints. (In fact, osteoarthritis is 
probably most often confused with rheumatoid arthritis if it affects multiple 
joints in the body.)</li> 
<li>The joints are less inflamed.</li> 
<li>Progression of pain is almost always gradual.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Gout.</i> Gout also causes swelling and severe pain in a joint, although 
most commonly starting in one joint. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish 
chronic gout in older people from rheumatoid arthritis, however, since gout in 
this population can occur in a number of joints. A proper diagnosis can be made 
with a detailed medical history, laboratory tests, and detection in the 
affected joint of crystals called<i>monosodium urate</i> (MSU), which 
identifies gout.</p>

 Treatment 
<p>The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis involves medications and lifestyle 
changes.</p> 
<h3>General Guidelines for Drug Treatments</h3> 
<p>Many drugs are used for managing the pain and slowing the progression of 
rheumatoid arthritis, but none completely cure the disease. It is likely that 
no single drug will ever cure rheumatoid arthritis because of the many factors 
that affect the disease at various times. The goals of drug treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduce inflammation</li> 
<li>Prevent damage to the bones and ligaments of the joint</li> 
<li>Preserve movement</li> 
<li>To be as inexpensive and as free from side effects as possible over the 
long-term</li> </ul> 
<h3>Drug Categories Used for Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3> 
<p>The drug categories used for RA include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</em> are the least 
potent drugs used for RA. These drugs relieve pain by reducing inflammation, 
but do not affect the course of the disease.</li> 
<li><em>Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)</em> are the main 
drugs used for treating rheumatoid arthritis. They slow the progression of the 
disease. They are much more effective than NSAIDs but also have more side 
effects. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) is the most widely used of these 
drugs.</li> 
<li><em>Biologic Response Modifiers</em> (also known as Biologic DMARDs) are 
often prescribed to patients who have failed to respond to DMARDs. They may be 
used alone or in combination with DMARDs such as methotrexate. They modify or 
block destructive immune factors such as tumor-necrosis factor (TNF). Current 
anti-TNF drugs include infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and 
adalimumab (Humira). Other biologic response modifiers include the 
interleukin-1 antagonist anakinra (Kineret), the T cell co-stimulation 
modulator abatacept (Orencia), and rituximab (Rituxan), which targets 
CD20-positive B cells.</li> 
<li><em>Corticosteroids</em>, or steroids, are powerful anti-inflammatory 
drugs that are used to quickly reduce inflammation. These drugs include 
prednisone and prednisolone.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Treatment Approaches</h3> 
<p>The question of how early and how aggressively to treat RA has been the 
subject of great debate. Among patients with RA, some will go into remission 
and remain in remission for the length of their lives even in the absence of 
treatment, while others will go on to develop active, sometimes severe RA.</p> 
<p>Current practice has moved towards treating the disease aggressively while 
it is in its early stages to help prevent it from reaching a more severe and 
chronic state. Studies have found less joint damage in patients with early, 
aggressive treatment, particularly with the use of DMARDs and TNF modifiers in 
combination with methotrexate. Intensive early dosing of methotrexate may help 
slow progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Early combination therapy with DMARDs 
and corticosteroids is also showing good results.</p> 
<p>Patients who have not been helped by one drug often benefit from a 
combination of drugs. However, over a longer period of time, it is not clear 
whether a drug combination approach offers many advantages over single drugs. 
It is also not certain which combination of drugs works best. Depending on your 
particular health condition, and how you respond to the drugs prescribed, your 
doctor may try various treatment strategies.</p> 
<p>Current DMARD guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology 
recommend:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Single DMARD</em>. Methotrexate or leflunomide as initial therapy for 
most patients with RA</li> 
<li><em>Dual DMARD Therapy</em>. Methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine for 
patients with moderate-to-high disease activity</li> 
<li><em>Triple DMARD Therapy</em>. Methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine plus 
sulfasalazine for patients with poor prognostic features and moderate-to-high 
levels of disease activity.</li> 
<li><em>Anti-TNF DMARDs</em>. For patients with early RA (less than 3 months), 
etanercept, infliximab,or adalimumab (along with methotrexate) should be 
reserved only for patients with high disease activity who have never received 
DMARDs. For longer duration RA, anti-TNF drugs are recommended for patients who 
have not been helped by methotrexate.</li> 
<li><em>Other Biologic DMARDs</em>. Abatacept and rituximab should be reserved 
for patients with at least moderate disease activity and poor disease prognosis 
who were not helped by methotrexate and other nonbiologic DMARDs.</li> </ul>

 Medications 
<h3>Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)</h3> 
<p>Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard treatments 
for RA. They are used either alone or in combination with newer biologic DMARDs.
</p> 
<p>DMARDs do not have any common properties other than their ability to slow 
down the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Many were used for other diseases 
and were found accidentally to help RA. DMARDs include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Methotrexate (considered to be the current standard of care)</li> 
<li>Leflunomide</li> 
<li>Hydroxychloroquine</li> 
<li>Sulfasalazine</li> 
<li>Gold</li> 
<li>Minocycline</li> 
<li>Azathioprine</li> 
<li>Cyclosporine</li> </ul> 
<p>Unfortunately, all DMARDs tend to lose effectiveness over time, even 
methotrexate. Patients rarely use one drug for more than 2 years. Combining 
DMARDs with each other or with drugs in other categories offers the best 
approach for many patients. The addition of a corticosteroid to any combination 
may also be helpful.</p> 
<p>All DMARDs may produce stomach and intestinal side effects, and, over the 
long-term, each poses some risk for rare but serious reactions. (In some cases, 
however, they may be less harmful than long-term NSAID treatment.)</p> 
<p><i>Methotrexate.</i> Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) acts as an 
anti-inflammatory drug and is now the most frequently used DMARD, particularly 
for severe disease. Methotrexate it starts working within 3 - 6 weeks, but its 
full effect may not occur until after 12 weeks of treatment.</p> 
<p>Even this drug loses effectiveness, however, when used alone. It may be 
more effective when used in combination with other DMARDs or other drugs. 
Methotrexate is often combined with hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalzine, or 
leflunomide. It may also be combined with various biological response modifier 
drugs, especially for treatment of patients with early aggressive arthritis. 
The combination appears to work better than single drug therapy.</p> 
<p>About 20% of patients withdraw from methotrexate because of its side 
effects. They include nausea and vomiting, rash, mild hair loss, headache, 
mouth sores, and muscle aches. Methotrexate reduces levels of folic acid 
(folate) in the body, which can lead to some of these side effects. Doctors may 
prescribe folic acid supplements to prevent side effects. However, some 
research suggests that folic acid may interfere with methotrexate's 
effectiveness.</p> 
<p>Methotrexate is usually given as pills. Patients who need higher doses can 
take it as an injection. Methotrexate has fewer serious toxic effects than many 
DMARDs. Although these severe reactions are rare, they may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Kidney and liver damage. People at particular risk for liver damage from 
methotrexate include those with diabetes, obesity, and alcoholism. Patients 
should limit alcohol consumption to no more than 2 drinks per month while 
taking this drug.</li> 
<li>Increased risk for infections. Methotrexate should not be given to 
patients with active bacterial infections, active herpes-zoster viral 
infection, active or latent tuberculosis, or acute or chronic hepatitis B or C.
</li> 
<li>Lung disease occurs in up to 5% of people. People who have poor lung 
function are most at risk.</li> 
<li>The drug increases the risk for birth defects and should not be taken by 
pregnant women. However, methotrexate will not harm a woman's chance for future 
healthy pregnancy.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Leflunomide.</i> Leflunomide (Arava) blocks autoimmune antibodies and 
reduces inflammation. It also may inhibit metalloproteinases (MMP), which are 
involved in cartilage destruction.</p> 
<p>Leflunomide takes several weeks before improving joint pain or swelling. 
Full benefits may not occur until 6- 12 weeks of treatment.</p> 
<p>Leflunomide may be given alone or in combination with other DMARDs such as 
methotrexate (This combination poses a risk for liver toxicity and requires 
monitoring.)</p> 
<p>Reports of adverse effects are comparable to those with methotrexate. 
Common problems include nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, and rash. Potentially 
serious side effects include infections and liver injury. Everyone taking 
leflunomide should be monitored regularly, including blood tests for liver 
function, and anyone with liver problems should not take this drug. Leflunomide 
should not be taken by patients with active bacterial infections, active 
herpes-zoster viral infection, active or latent tuberculosis, or acute or 
chronic hepatitis B or C.</p> 
<p><i>Hydroxychloroquine.</i> Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) was originally 
used for preventing malaria and is now also used for mild, slowly progressive 
arthritis. It starts to improve symptoms within 1 - 2 months, but may take up 
to 6 months to achieve full benefit. It also does not appear to slow disease 
progression. Hydroxycholoroquine usually causes less side effects than other 
DMARDs. The most common side effects are nausea and diarrhea, which typically 
improve over time or when the drug is taken with food. Less common side effects 
include skin rash or bleaching or thinning of hair.</p> 
<p>This drug used to be associated with eye and vision problems, but with 
current lower doses this side effect is rare. If vision problems occur, it is 
usually with people taking very high doses, those with kidney disease, or those 
over 60 years of age. Still, patients should have an eye exam (including 
retinal examination) within the first year of treatment. Patients with health 
risks (liver disease, retinal disease, over age 60) should have an annual eye 
exam. Patients should notify their doctors if they experience any sudden 
changes in vision.</p> 
<p><i>Sulfasalazine.</i> Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) was developed in the 1930s 
for treating rheumatoid arthritis, but fell into disfavor when gold treatment 
emerged. It has regained popularity, however, and is now used for both adult 
and juvenile RA. It works best when the disease is confined to the joints. 
Symptom relief occurs within 1 - 3 months.</p> 
<p>Side effects are common, particularly stomach and intestinal distress, 
which usually occur early in the course of treatment. (However, serious 
gastrointestinal side effects, such as stomach ulcers, occur less frequently 
with sulfasalazine than with NSAIDs.) A coated-tablet form may help reduce side 
effects. Other side effects include skin rash and headache. Sulfasalazine 
increases sensitivity to sunlight. Be sure to wear sunscreen (SPF 15 or higher) 
while taking this drug. People with intestinal or urinary obstructions or who 
have allergies to sulfa drugs or salicylates should not take sulfasalazine.</p> 
<p><i>Gold.</i> Gold has been a long-standing DMARD for rheumatoid arthritis, 
although its use has decreased with the development of disease modifying and 
biologic drugs. Gold is usually administered in an injected form because the 
oral form, auranofin (Ridaura), is much less effective. There are two 
injectable forms of gold: Gold sodium thiomalate (Myochrysine) and 
aurothioglucose (Solganal). It can take 3 - 6 months before injections have an 
effect on RA symptoms.</p> 
<p>Gold injections cause mouth sores in about a third of patients. Skin side 
effects include itching and rash, which can be severe in some patients. The 
most serious side effects of gold injections, while rare, are kidney damage and 
decreased white blood cell count. Gold injections are not usually given to 
pregnant women. It is not definite that gold causes birth defects, but doctors 
generally recommend women use birth control while receiving this drug.</p> 
<p><em>Minocycline</em>. Minocycline (Minocin) is a tetracycline antibiotic 
that is generally reserved for patients with mild RA. It can take 2 - 3 months 
before symptoms begin to improve and up to a year for full benefit. Side 
effects include upset stomach, dizziness, and skin rash. Long-term use of 
minocycline can cause changes in skin color, but this side effect usually 
disappears once the medication is stopped. Minocycline can cause yeast 
infections in women. It should not be used by women who are pregnant or 
planning on becoming pregnant. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight 
and patients should be sure to wear sunscreen. In rare cases, minocycline can 
affect the kidneys and liver.</p> 
<p><em>Azathioprine</em>. Azathioprine (Imuran) suppresses immune system 
activity. It takes 6 - 8 weeks for early symptom improvement and up to 12 weeks 
for full benefit. Azathioprine can cause serious problems with the 
gastrointestinal tract. About 10 - 15% of patients experience nausea and 
vomiting, often accompanied by stomach pain and diarrhea. (Taking the 
medication twice daily, instead of once daily, or taking it after eating may 
help avoid this problem.) Azathioprine can also cause problems with liver 
function and pancreas gland inflammation, and can reduce white blood cell count.
</p> 
<p><i>Cyclosporine.</i> Like azathioprine, cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral) 
is an immunosuppressant. It is used for people with RA who have not responded 
to other drugs. It can take a week before symptoms improve and up to 3 months 
for full benefit. The most serious and common side effects of cyclosporine are 
high blood pressure and kidney function problems. While kidney function usually 
improves once the drug is stopped, mild-to-moderate high blood pressure may 
continue. Cyclosporine can also cause gout or worsen gout in people who have 
this condition.</p> 
<p>Other common side effects include headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain 
and upset, and swelling of hands and feet. About 10% of patients who take 
cyclosporine develop tremors, increased hair growth, muscle cramps, and numbing 
or tingling in hands and feet (neuropathy). Swelling of the gums is also 
common. Patients should practice good dental hygiene, including regular 
brushing and flossing.</p> 
<h3>Biologic Response Modifiers (Biologic DMARDs)</h3> 
<p>Biologic response modifiers are drugs made from living cells. These drugs 
target specific components of the immune system that contribute to the joint 
inflammation and damage that are part of the rheumatoid arthritis disease 
process.</p> 
<p>Currently approved biologic response modifiers include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Etanercept (Enbrel). Etanercept is an anti-tumor necrosis factor 
(anti-TNF) drug. Approved in 1998, etanercept was the first biologic response 
modifier drug for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also approved for 
juvenile RA and psoriatic arthritis.</li> 
<li>Infliximab (Remicade). Approved in 1999, infliximab is also an anti-TNF 
drug. It is used in combination with methotrexate.</li> 
<li>Adalimumab (Humira). Adalimumab is another anti-TNF drug. First approved 
in 2002 as a second-line treatment for RA, adalimumab received additional 
approvals in 2005 as a first-line treatment for RA and psoriatic arthritis. It 
is used alone or in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs. It is also 
showing promising results in clinical trials for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
</li> 
<li>Anakinra (Kineret). Approved in 2001, anakinra targets interleukin-1 
(IL-1), another type of immune factor.</li> 
<li>Abatacept (Orencia). Approved in 2005 for adults with moderate-to-severe 
RA who have not responded to DMARD or anti-TNF drugs. Abatacept is known as a T 
cell co-stimulation modulator. It blocks T cell activation. It is used alone or 
in combination with other DMARDs aside from anti-TNF drugs.</li> 
<li>Rituximab (Rituxan). Approved in 2006, rituximab targets CD20-positive B 
cells and blocks their activation. It is used in combination with methotrexate 
for patients with moderate-to-severe RA who have not responded to anti-TNF 
therapies.</li> </ul> 
<p>Some of these drugs are used as first-line treatments for RA. Others are 
used for patients who have not responded to DMARDs or other types of treatment. 
Depending on the specific drug, they may be used alone or in combination with 
the DMARD methotrexate. However, biologic response modifiers are not used in 
combination with each other, as they can lead to serious infections.</p> 
<p>As with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs, these drugs do not cure the 
disease but can help slow progression and joint damage. In recent clinical 
trials, some patients have achieved remission using methotrexate in combination 
with infliximab, adalimumab, or rituximab.</p> 
<p><em>Side Effects and Complications</em>. Etanercept, adalimumab, and 
anakinra are given by injection and may cause pain at the injection site. To 
prevent injection reactions, patients are sometimes pretreated with 
betamethasone, a corticosteroid drug, but some research suggests that the 
steroid does little good. Infliximab, abatacept and rituximab are given by 
intravenous infusion. Common infusion reactions include headache, nausea, and 
flu-like symptoms. Because biologic response modifiers affect the immune 
system, patients who take these drugs have an increased risk for infections.</p>
<p>Biologic DMARDs should not be taken by patients with active bacterial 
infections, active herpes-zoster viral infection, active or latent 
tuberculosis, or active or chronic hepatitis B or C. In addition, anti-TNF 
drugs (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) should not be given to patients with 
a history of heart failure, a history of lymphoma, or who have multiple 
sclerosis or other demyelinating disorders.</p> 
<p>Other risks associated with these drugs include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Anti-TNF drugs (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) have been associated 
with sepsis (blood infections), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other 
opportunistic and fungal infections; non-melanoma skin cancer, lymphoma, and 
other malignancies; lupus; heart failure; blood disorders (including aplastic 
anemia); palmoplantar psoriasis; lung disease; and liver damage.</li> 
<li>Anakinra may cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (leukopenia) that 
increases the risk for infections.</li> 
<li>Abatacept should be used cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disorder (COPD) as it may increase the risk for respiratory 
complications.</li> 
<li>Rituximab has been associated with cases of a rare and deadly brain 
disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). It also may 
cause hepatitis B reactivation, viral infections, and heart rhythm disturbances 
and other heart problems.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Corticosteroids (Steroids)</h3> 
<p>Corticosteroids work rapidly to control inflammation and pain. Long-time 
use, however, can have severe adverse effects. Still, they are often used under 
the following conditions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Oral corticosteroids, such as prednisolone and prednisone (Deltasone, 
Orasone), are most often used in combination with DMARDs, which significantly 
enhances the benefits of DMARDs.</li> 
<li>Oral corticosteroids are sometimes used in early stage-RA for patients who 
cannot tolerate NSAIDs. Studies, in fact, suggest that low-dose corticosteroids 
may significantly slow joint pain when it is the first drug administered and 
then used for 2 years. (Even low-dose oral steroids have adverse effects on 
bone density, blood sugar, and weight.)</li> 
<li>Higher doses of corticosteroids are used for flareups of vasculitis and 
severe reactions to medications.</li> 
<li>Corticosteroids may also be used during pregnancy to avoid exposure to 
more toxic drugs.</li> 
<li>Daily, low-dose corticosteroids are also needed in some patients to 
control their rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.</li> 
<li>Corticosteroids are sometimes injected directly into joints for relief of 
flare-ups when only one or a few joints are affected. Doctors recommend no more 
than three or four injections into a specific joint a year. Steroid injections 
in the joints may be a safe and effective treatment for juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis and reduce the need for oral medication.</li> 
<li>Corticosteroid pulse therapy (intravenous administration) may work as well 
as DMARDs.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Side Effects of Oral Corticosteroids.</i> Serious side effects are 
associated with long-term use of oral steroids. (Low doses may reduce these 
risks, but they do not eliminate them.) Osteoporosis is a common and 
particularly severe long-term side effect of prolonged steroid use. Medications 
that can prevent osteoporosis include calcium supplements, parathyroid hormone, 
or bisphosphonates (such as alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate). Other 
adverse effects include cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, fluid retention, 
susceptibility to infections, weight gain, hypertension, capillary fragility, 
acne, excess hair growth, wasting of the muscles, menstrual irregularities, 
irritability, insomnia, and, rarely, psychosis. Recent research suggests that 
prednisone can increase the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer.</p> 
<p><i>Withdrawal from Long-Term Use of Oral Corticosteroids.</i> Long-term use 
of oral steroid medications suppresses secretion of natural steroid hormones by 
the adrenal glands. After withdrawal from these drugs, this so-called adrenal 
suppression persists and it can take the body a while (sometimes up to a year) 
to regain its ability to produce natural steroids again. There have been a few 
cases of severe adrenal insufficiency that occurred when switching from oral to 
inhaled steroids, which, in rare cases, has resulted in death.</p> 
<p>No one should stop taking any steroids without consulting a doctor first, 
and if steroids are withdrawn, regular follow-up monitoring is necessary. 
Patients should discuss with their doctor measures for preventing adrenal 
insufficiency during withdrawal, particularly during stressful times, when the 
risk increases.</p> 
<h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3> 
<p>Two-thirds of people with RA rank pain as their primary reason for seeking 
professional help. The most common pain relievers for RA are nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs block prostaglandins, the 
substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain. There are 
dozens of NSAIDs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Over-the-counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, 
Nuprin, Rufen), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT).</li> 
<li>Prescription NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, 
Anaprox), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), diclofenac (Voltaren), tolmetin (Tolectin), 
ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail), dexibuprofen (Seractil). In 2004, a new NSAID, 
meloxicam (Mobic) was approved in the U.S. for the management and treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis.</li> </ul> 
<p>Studies suggest that the best times for taking an NSAID may be after the 
evening meal and then again on awakening. RA symptoms increase gradually during 
the night, reaching their greatest severity at the time of awakening. Taking 
NSAIDs with food can reduce stomach discomfort, although it may slow down the 
pain-relieving effect.</p> 
<p>Long-term, regular use of NSAIDs (with the exception of aspirin) can 
increase the risk for heart attack, especially for people who have a heart 
condition. Long-term use of NSAIDs is also the second most common cause of 
ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. To reduce the risks associated with 
NSAIDs, take the lowest dose possible for pain relief.</p> 
<p>Other possible side effects of NSAIDs may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Upset stomach</li> 
<li>Dyspepsia (burning, bloated feeling in pit of stomach)</li> 
<li>Drowsiness</li> 
<li>Skin bruising</li> 
<li>High blood pressure</li> 
<li>Fluid retention</li> 
<li>Headache</li> 
<li>Rash</li> 
<li>Reduced kidney function</li> </ul> 
<p><em>COX-2 Inhibitors (Coxibs).</em> Coxibs inhibit an 
inflammation-promoting enzyme called COX-2. This drug class was initially 
thought to provide benefits equal to NSAIDs but cause less gastrointestinal 
distress. However, following numerous reports of heart problems, skin rashes, 
and other adverse effects, the FDA re-evaluated the risks and benefits of this 
drug class. This lead to the removal of rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib 
(Bextra) from the United States market. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is still 
available, but patients should ask their doctor whether the drug is appropriate 
and safe for them. In 2006, the FDA approved celecoxib for the relief of 
symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients ages 2 years and older.
</p> 
<h3>Investigational Treatments</h3> 
<p><em>Biologic Drugs</em>. For many years, therapeutic treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis focused on T cell mediation. New research is now examining 
the role of B cells, which become overactive in autoimmune disease, and how B 
cell depletion may help to reduce disease activity. Other areas of intense 
research include interleukin receptor antagonists, which target cytokines 
involved in the inflammatory process.</p> 
<p>Many of the current investigational drugs are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 
biologic drugs that are designed to target specific receptors. Promising 
biologic drug candidates in late-stage research include tocilizumab (Actemra), 
golimumab, denosumab, ofatumumab, certolizumab, and baminercept.</p> 
<p><i>Statins.</i> Some research suggests that compounds derived from statins, 
the highly regarded cholesterol-lowering drugs, may suppress the inflammation 
responsible for RA damage.</p> 
<p><em>Stem cell transplantation</em>. Stem cells are the early versions of 
mature, specialized blood cells. Investigators are reporting that 
transplantation of donated hemopoietic stem cells, which mature into various 
blood cells, has induced remission in a few children with severe juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis. The procedure is promising in select cases, but it can be 
highly toxic. More studies are needed to determine risks and benefits for RA 
patients.</p> 
<p><em>Plasmapheresis</em>. A device called the Prosorba column is used to 
remove inflammatory antibodies from the patient's blood. Small, short-term 
studies have shown that this therapy may slow or even halt the progression of 
the disease in a third to a half of patients. Side effects from the Prosorba 
column may include anemia, fatigue, itching, fever, a drop in blood pressure, 
and nausea. Nearly all patients experience an immediate flare-up of joint pain 
that lasts a few days. Some patients develop infection from the catheter used 
to remove blood. Long-term studies are needed.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Surgery 
<h3>Joint Surgeries</h3> 
<p>Certain surgical techniques may be helpful for people with severe 
deformities or disabilities.</p> 
<p><i>Arthroscopy.</i> Arthroscopy is performed to clean out bone and 
cartilage fragments that cause pain and inflammation. It is usually performed 
on the knee, but it also may be done on the hip:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The surgeon makes a small incision and injects a sterile solution to make 
the joint swell for easier viewing.</li> 
<li>A lighted tube, called an arthroscope (which enables the surgeon to view 
the joint), is then inserted through another small incision.</li> 
<li>Through a third incision, the surgeon trims, shaves, or stitches the 
damaged tissue. (Arthroscopy is most successful when the removal of cartilage 
only, and not bone, is involved.)</li> </ul> 
<p>In many cases, the procedure can be done using local anesthetic, and the 
patient can go home within a day. In the case of knee operations, patients can 
resume mild activity in a couple of days, but full recovery can take up to 3 
months.</p> 
<p><i>Osteotomy.</i> If only a certain section (<i>the medial compartment</i>) 
of the knee is damaged and deformed, the surgeon may choose to perform 
osteotomy:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The knee is opened.</li> 
<li>A <i>debridement</i> (removal of damaged tissue) is performed in the joint 
to eliminate the loose or torn fragments that are causing pain and inflammation.
</li> 
<li>The bone is then reshaped to remove the deformity.</li> </ul> 
<p>The procedure is best used in heavier adults who are under 60 years old.</p>
<p><i>Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.</i> Unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty (also called unicondylar knee arthroplasty) may be a useful 
procedure in some cases of limited damage in the knee. It is intended to 
relieve pain and preserve function as long as possible before a total knee 
replacement is necessary. The procedure involves a small incision and insertion 
of small implants. It retains important knee ligaments, which should preserve 
more movement than a total knee replacement. The procedure is not widely 
available and is somewhat controversial, since the implants may not be as 
reliable as those in total knee replacement.</p> 
<p><i>Synovectomy.</i> Synovectomy is a procedure whereby the diseased joint 
lining is removed. It is used when more conservative measures fail, 
particularly in the wrist. Studies are suggesting, however, that with the use 
of lasers for the procedure, eventually synovectomy may prove to be an 
alternative to DMARD treatments in reducing symptoms and achieving long-term 
remission.</p> 
<p><i>Joint Replacement Surgery.</i> Eventually, even after these procedures, 
rheumatoid arthritis may progress to the point that normal functioning is 
impossible. In such cases, artificial (prosthetic) replacement joint implants 
may be considered for knees, hips, or other joints. The prosthesis is usually 
made of a chromium alloy and plastic and may be attached to the adjoining bones 
using a cement, polymethyl methacrylate, or the prosthesis may be composed of a 
porous material that allows bone to grow into and eventually adhere to the 
device.</p> 
<p>Although this procedure has usually been performed in people over 60, 
implants are now lasting 20 years and more and younger patients with severe 
disability are finding them useful.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Lifestyle Changes 
<p>It is important to maintain a balance between rest (which will reduce 
inflammation) and moderate exercise (which will relieve stiffness and 
weakness). Studies have suggested that even as little as 3 hours of physical 
therapy over 6 weeks will help people with RA, and that these benefits are 
sustained.</p> 
<p>The goal of exercise is to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Maintain a wide range of motion</li> 
<li>Increase strength, endurance, and mobility</li> 
<li>Improve general health</li> 
<li>Promote well-being</li> </ul> 
<p>In general, doctors recommend the following approaches:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Start with the easiest exercises, stretching and tensing of the joints 
without movement.</li> 
<li>Next, attempt mild strength training.</li> 
<li>The next step is to try aerobic exercises. These include walking, dancing, 
or swimming, particularly in heated pools. Avoid heavy impact exercises, such 
as running, downhill skiing, and jumping.</li> 
<li>Tai chi, which uses graceful slow sweeping movements, is an excellent 
method for combining stretching and range-of-motion exercises with relaxation 
techniques. It may be of particularl value for elderly patients with RA.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>A common -sense approach to exercise is the best guide:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If exercise is causing sharp pain, stop immediately.</li> 
<li>If lesser aches and pains continue for more than 2 hours afterwards, try a 
lighter exercise program for a while.</li> 
<li>Using large joints instead of small ones for ordinary tasks can help 
relieve pressure, for instance, closing a door with the hip or pushing buttons 
with the palm of the hand.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Diet</h3> 
<p>Many patients with RA try dietary approaches, such as fasting, vegan diets, 
or eliminating specific foods, that seem to worsen RA symptoms. There is little 
scientific evidence to support these approaches but some patients report 
anecdotally that they are helpful.</p> 
<p>In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that the omega-3 fatty 
acids contained in fish oil may have anti-inflammatory properties useful for RA 
joint pain relief. The best source of fish oil is through increased consumption 
of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and herring. Fish oil supplements are 
another option, but they may interact with certain medications. If you are 
thinking of trying fish oil supplements, talk to your doctor first.</p> 
<h3>Miscellaneous Supportive Treatments</h3> 
<p>Various ointments, including Ben Gay and capsaicin (a cream that use the 
active ingredient in chilli peppers), may help soothe painful joints.</p> 
<p>Orthotic devices are specialized braces and splints that support and help 
align joints. Many such devices made from a variety of light materials are 
available and can be very helpful when worn properly.</p> 
<p>A number of specially designed appliances and devices are available to ease 
daily activities.</p> 
<h3>Managing Psychological and Emotional Conditions</h3> 
<p>Although the influence of stress or emotions on the progression of RA is 
not fully known, having a history of major depression that persists or reoccurs 
seems to increase the pain, disability, and fatigue. Stress management alone 
cannot reduce pain, but it may be very helpful in helping people deal with 
their condition.</p> 
<h3>Alternative and Integrative Medicine</h3> 
<p>People often turn to alternative therapies or nontraditional remedies to 
relieve the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Although there is no definitive 
evidence to support their efficacy, some alternative procedures -- such as 
acupuncture, massage, mineral baths (balneotherapy), relaxation techniques, 
biofeedback, and hypnosis -- are not harmful and may be a useful adjunct to 
standard treatments.</p> 
<h3>Herbal Remedies</h3> 
<p>Herbal remedies used for RA include boswellia, equisetum arvense 
(horsetail), devil's claw, borage seed oil, and many others. To date, no 
evidence supports their efficacy.</p> 
<p>Researchers are currently conducting studies to determine if supplements 
extracted from the turmeric spice can help prevent joint inflammation. The 
Chinese medicine herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is also being 
investigated for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p> 
<p>Generally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not 
need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and 
supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential 
to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been a number of 
reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. 
Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary 
supplements.</p> Back to Top <br>
