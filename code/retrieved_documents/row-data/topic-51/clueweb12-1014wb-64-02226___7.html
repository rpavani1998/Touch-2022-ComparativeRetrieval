<h1>What to do if you are sick or <br>
think you&nbsp;may be&nbsp;infected 
with the flu</h1>  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This page includes some of the most important steps for taking care of 
yourself and protecting others.&nbsp; For more detailed guidance see the 
following documents:</p>

<li><strong>Flu Frequently Asked Questions</strong> [English]&nbsp; [Spanish

Chinese]</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<h2>When should I see a doctor?</h2> 
<p>Most people sick with the flu have mild disease and do not need to see a 
doctor or get tested.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>If you are at high risk for getting very sick with the flu, contact 
your doctor to discuss the need for treatment.&nbsp; High risk people include:
</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>People with lung disease like asthma</li> 
<li>People with other medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, kidney 
or liver disease, blood cell disease including sickle cell, or neurological 
disease that affects swallowing or breathing</li> 
<li>Pregnant women and women who have given birth within 2 weeks</li> 
<li>Children age 2 years and under </li> 
<li>Adults age&nbsp;50 years and over</li> 
<li>People with weak immune systems (due to disease or medicines)</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>If you have these symptoms call your doctor right away:</strong></p>
<ul> 
<li>Have difficulty breathing</li> 
<li>Are dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea</li> 
<li>Have a fever that is higher than 101 degrees after taking fever-reducing 
medicine like acetaminophen (e.g.,Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin or Advil)
</li> 
<li>Feel very sick</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>How is the flu spread?</h2> 
<p>The flu is spread through tiny&nbsp;wet drops produced when a&nbsp;person 
coughs, sneezes, or talks. A person without the flu can get it by breathing in 
these wet drops, or by touching&nbsp;items and surfaces covered with these 
drops and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. Someone who has the flu may 
be able to spread it to others about 1 day before getting sick to 5 to 7 days 
after they become sick. People are most contagious during the first 3 days of 
illness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>What should I do to protect others from getting the flu?</h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Stay home and stay away from others until 24 hours after the fever is gone 
(without the use of fever-reducing medicine like acetaminophen (e.g.,Tylenol) 
or ibuprofen(e.g., Motrin or Advil)</li> 
<li>Do not have visitors</li> 
<li>Try to avoid contact with other other people living with you</li> 
<li>If possible, choose a room in your home&nbsp;to stay in that is away from 
others in your household (for example, a spare bedroom with bathroom)</li> 
<li>Choose one person in the household as your caregiver. Your caregiver 
should not be pregnant, over 64 years old, or have medical conditions like 
heart disease, lung disease, or weak immune system.</li> 
<li>If you want, wear a face mask when around others. Wearing a face mask 
limits the spread of tiny infected drops that are released when a person talks, 
coughs or sneezes.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Have everyone in the house use healthy habits:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Get vaccinated for the flu</li> 
<li>Wash hands frequently with soap or water or use alcohol-based hand rub</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue (or shirt sleeve) when sneezing, 
coughing or blowing your nose</li> 
<li>Don't share personal items like toothbrushes or&nbsp;drinks</li> 
<li>Clean frequently touched items and surfaces with soap and water</li> </ul> 
<h2><br>
</h2> 
<h2>Should people with the flu wear a mask?</h2> 
<p>A&nbsp;sick person can wear a face mask when around others to help prevent 
the spread of flu. Wearing a face mask limits the spread of tiny infected drops 
that are released when a person talks, coughs or sneezes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Can I take medicines to help me feel better?</h2> 
<p>To make your symptoms feel better, take medicines that you would normally 
take like acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin or Advil) if 
your doctor has told you it is safe for you. If you are under 18 years of age 
do NOT take aspirin or medicine with aspirin in it (e.g. Pepto-Bismol) because 
this can cause a rare serious illness called Reye's syndrome. Also, children 
under age 4 should not take over-the-counter cold medicines unless their doctor 
said to take the medicine.</p> <br>

<h2>Do I need to take anti-viral medicines to treat the flu virus?</h2> 
<p>Probably not. Anti-viral medicines are only available with a doctor's 
prescription. Most people with the flu get better without taking medicine. Your 
doctor may prescribe anti-viral medicine if you are:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>very sick</li> 
<li>with a lung disease like asthma</li> 
<li>with a medical condition like diabetes, heart disease, kidney or liver 
disease, blood cell disease including sickle cell, or neurological disease that 
affects swallowing or breathing</li> 
<li>pregnant</li> 
<li>a child aged 2 years or under</li> 
<li>age 65 and up </li> 
<li>with a weakened immune system (from disease or medicines)</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>What are the emergency warning signs?</h2> 
<p><strong>Contact a doctor right away if a young child has these emergency 
warning signs:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fast breathing or trouble breathing</li> 
<li>Blue-ish color of skin, lips, or fingertips</li> 
<li>Not drinking enough fluids or not urinating</li> 
<li>Not waking up or not interacting</li> 
<li>Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held</li> 
<li>Flu-like symptoms that improve but then come back with fever and worse 
cough</li> 
<li>Fever with a rash</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Contact a doctor right away if an older child or adult has these 
emergency warning signs:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath </li> 
<li>Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen </li> 
<li>Sudden dizziness </li> 
<li>Confusion </li> 
<li>Severe or persistent vomiting </li> 
<li>Not urinating</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>When going to the doctor's office or the emergency room:</strong>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Inform the staff ahead of time that you have the flu</li> 
<li>If you call an ambulance, let the 911 operator know that you have the flu. 
Let the ambulance crew know too when they arrive</li> 
<li>Wear a face mask if you can </li> 
<li>Sit away from others as much as possible</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Do I need to go to the emergency room if I am only a little sick?</h2> 
<p>No. The emergency room should be saved for people who are very sick. People 
should not go to the emergency room for a mild illness.</p>
