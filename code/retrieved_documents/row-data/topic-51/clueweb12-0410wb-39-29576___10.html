<h2>What is the most important information I should know about aspirin?</h2> 
<p>There are many brands and forms of aspirin available and not all brands are 
listed on this leaflet.</p> Aspirin should not be given to a child or teenager 
who has a fever, especially if the child also has flu symptoms or chicken pox.
<b>Aspirin can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called Reye's 
syndrome in children.</b> <br>
<br>

<p>Stop using this medication and call your doctor at once if you have any 
symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or intestines. Symptoms include black, 
bloody, or tarry stools, and coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee 
grounds.</p> Avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking aspirin. Alcohol may 
increase your risk of stomach bleeding. <br>
<br>

<p>Aspirin is sometimes used to treat or prevent heart attacks, strokes, and 
chest pain (angina).<b>Aspirin should be used for cardiovascular conditions 
only under the supervision of a doctor.</b></p> 
<h2>What is aspirin?</h2> 
<p>Aspirin is in a group of drugs called salicylates (sa-LIS-il-ates). It 
works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and 
inflammation.</p> 
<p>Aspirin is used to treat mild to moderate pain, and also to reduce fever or 
inflammation. Aspirin is sometimes used to treat or prevent heart attacks, 
strokes, and chest pain (angina).<b>Aspirin should be used for cardiovascular 
conditions only under the supervision of a doctor.</b></p> 
<p>Aspirin may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication 
guide.</p> 
<h2>What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking aspirin?
</h2> Aspirin should not be given to a child or teenager who has a fever, 
especially if the child also has flu symptoms or chicken pox.<b>Aspirin can 
cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called Reye's syndrome in 
children.</b> <br>
<br>
Do not use this medication if you are allergic to 
aspirin, or if you have: <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>a recent history of stomach or intestinal bleeding;</li> 
<li>a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia; or</li> 
<li>an allergy to an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as 
Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Orudis, Indocin, Lodine, Voltaren, Toradol, Mobic, 
Relafen, Feldene, and others.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you have any of these other conditions, you may need a dose adjustment 
or special tests to safely take aspirin:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>asthma or seasonal allergies;</li> 
<li>stomach ulcers;</li> 
<li>liver disease;</li> 
<li>kidney disease;</li> 
<li>a bleeding or blood clotting disorder;</li> 
<li>heart disease, high blood pressure, or congestive heart failure;</li> 
<li>gout; or</li> 
<li>nasal polyps.</li> </ul> If you are taking aspirin to prevent heart attack 
or stroke, avoid also taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). Ibuprofen may make 
aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you must 
use both medications, take the ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes 
after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form). <br>
<br>
This medication 
may be harmful to an unborn baby's heart, and may also reduce birth weight or 
have other dangerous effects. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to 
become pregnant while you are taking aspirin. <br>
<br>
Aspirin can pass into 
breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without 
telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. <br>
<br>

<h2>How should I take aspirin?</h2> 
<p>Use this medication exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been 
prescribed by your doctor. Do not use the medication in larger or smaller 
amounts, or use it for longer than recommended.</p> Take this medication with a 
full glass of water. <br>
<br>
Taking aspirin with food or milk can lessen 
stomach upset. Enteric-coated aspirin is specially formulated to be gentle on 
your stomach, but you may take it with food or milk if desired. <br>
<br>
Do 
not crush, chew, break, or open an<b>enteric-coated </b> or <b>extended-release
</b> pill. Swallow the pill whole. The enteric-coated pill has a special 
coating to protect your stomach. Breaking the pill could damage this coating. 
The extended-release tablet is specially made to release medicine slowly in the 
body. Breaking this pill would cause too much of the drug to be released at one 
time. <br>
<br>

<p>The <b>chewable tablet</b> form of aspirin must be chewed before swallowing.
</p> 
<p>Keep the <b>orally disintegrating tablet</b> in its package until you are 
ready to take the medicine. Open the package and peel the back cover from the 
tablet. Using dry hands, place the tablet into your mouth. It will begin to 
dissolve right away, without water. Do not swallow the tablet whole. Allow it 
to dissolve in your mouth without chewing.</p> 
<p>If you need to have any type of surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time 
that you are taking aspirin. You may need to stop using the medicine for a 
short time.</p> Do not take this medication if you smell a strong vinegar odor 
in the aspirin bottle. The medicine may no longer be effective. <br>
<br>
Store 
aspirin at room temperature away from moisture and heat. <br>
<br>

<h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2> 
<p>Since aspirin is often used as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. 
If you are using the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you 
remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and wait 
until your next regularly scheduled dose.<b>Do not</b> use extra medicine to 
make up the missed dose.</p> 
<h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2> Seek emergency medical attention if you 
think you have used too much of this medicine. <br>
<br>

<p>Overdose symptoms may include ringing in your ears, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, rapid breathing, fever, seizure 
(convulsions), or coma.</p> 
<h2>What should I avoid while taking aspirin?</h2> Do not use any other 
over-the-counter medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. 
Aspirin is contained in many medicines available over the counter. If you take 
certain products together you may accidentally take too much aspirin. Read the 
label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin. <br>

<br> 
<p>Avoid taking an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) while you are 
taking aspirin. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), diclofenac 
(Voltaren), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), 
indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Orudis), ketorolac (Toradol), mefenamic 
acid (Ponstel), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), naproxen (Aleve, 
Naprosyn), piroxicam (Feldene), and others.</p> Avoid drinking alcohol while 
you are taking aspirin. Alcohol may increase your risk of stomach bleeding. <br>
<br> Avoid taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) if you are taking aspirin to 
prevent stroke or heart attack. Ibuprofen can make aspirin less effective in 
protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take 
the ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin 
(non-enteric coated form). <br>
<br>

<h2>What are the possible side effects of aspirin?</h2> Get emergency medical 
help if you have any of these<b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; 
difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. <br>
<br>

Stop using this medication and call your doctor at once if you have any of 
these serious side effects: <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>black, bloody, or tarry stools;</li> 
<li>coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds;</li> 
<li>severe nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain;</li> 
<li>fever lasting longer than 3 days;</li> 
<li>swelling, or pain lasting longer than 10 days; or</li> 
<li>hearing problems, ringing in your ears.</li> </ul> 
<p>Less serious side effects may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>upset stomach, heartburn;</li> 
<li>drowsiness; or</li> 
<li>headache.</li> </ul> 
<p>This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your 
doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to 
FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p> 
<h2>What other drugs will affect aspirin?</h2> 
<p>Tell your doctor if you are taking an antidepressant such as citalopram 
(Celexa), duloxetine (Cymbalta), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, 
Sarafem, Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline 
(Zoloft), or venlafaxine (Effexor). Taking any of these drugs with aspirin may 
cause you to bruise or bleed easily.</p> 
<p>Before taking aspirin, tell your doctor if you are using any of the 
following drugs:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin); or</li> 
<li>another salicylate such as choline salicylate and/or magnesium salicylate 
(Magan, Doan's, Bayer Select Backache Pain Formula, Mobidin, Arthropan, 
Trilisate, Tricosal), or salsalate (Disalcid).</li> </ul> 
<p>This list is not complete and there may be other drugs that can interact 
with aspirin. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter 
medications you use. This includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and 
drugs prescribed by other doctors. Do not start using a new medication without 
telling your doctor.</p> 
<h2>Where can I get more information?</h2> 
<p>Your pharmacist can provide more information about aspirin.</p>
