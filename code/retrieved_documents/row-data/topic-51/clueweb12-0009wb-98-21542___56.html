 WHAT ARE LOW BACK 
PAIN AND SCIATICA?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 The Spine </strong></p><br>
<i>Vertebrae.</i> The spine is a 
column of small bones, or<i>vertebrae,</i> that support the entire upper body. 
The column is grouped into three sections of vertebrae: 
<ul> 
<li> The <i>cervical</i> (C) vertebrae are the seven spinal bones that support 
the neck.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The <i>thoracic</i> (T) vertebrae are the twelve spinal bones that 
connect to the rib cage.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The <i>lumbar</i> (L) vertebrae are the five lowest and largest bones of 
the spinal column. Most of the body's weight and stress falls on the lumbar 
vertebrae.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Below the lumbar region is the <i>sacrum</i>, a shield-shaped bony 
structure that connects with the pelvis at the sacroiliac joints.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> At the end of the sacrum are two to four tiny, partially fused vertebrae 
known as the<i>coccyx</i> or &quot;tail bone.&quot; </li> </ul> Each vertebra 
can be designated by using a letter and number; the letter reflects the region 
(C=cervical, T=thoracic, and L=lumbar) and the number signifies its location 
within that region. For example, C4 is the fourth bone down in the cervical 
region and T8 is the eighth thoracic vertebrae.<br>
<br>
<i>The Discs. </i> 
Vertebrae in the spinal column are separated from each other by small cushions 
of cartilage known as<i>intervertebral discs </i>. Inside each disc is a 
jelly-like substance called the<i> nucleus pulposus </i>, which is surrounded 
by a tough, fibrous shell called the<i>annulus.</i> The disc is 80% water. This 
structure makes the disk both elastic and strong. The discs have no blood 
supply of their own, however, but rely on nearby blood vessels to keep them 
nourished.<br>
<br>
<i>Processes.</i> Each vertebra in the spine has a number 
of bony projections, known as<i>processes</i>. The spinal and transverse 
processes attach to the muscles in the back and act like little levers, 
allowing the spine to twist or bend. The particular processes form the joints 
between the vertebrae themselves, meeting together and interlocking at the<i>
facet joints</i>. <br>
<br>
<i>Spinal Canal. </i> Each vertebra and its 
processes surround and protect an arch-shaped central opening. These arches, 
aligned to run down the spine, form the spinal canal, which encloses the spinal 
cord.<br>
<br>
<i>Spinal Cord. </i> The spinal cord is the central trunk of 
nerves that connects the brain with the rest of the body. Each nerve root 
passes from the spinal column to other parts of the body through small openings 
bounded on one side by the disc and the other by the facets. When the spinal 
cord reaches the lumbar region, it splits into four bundled strands of nerve 
roots called the cauda equina (meaning horsetail in Latin).<br>
<br>
<i>The 
Sciatic Nerve.</i>The sciatic nerve is the one most likely to be affected in 
low back pain and has an extensive pathway: 
<ul> 
<li> It first branches from the nerve roots that descend off the lowest part 
of the spinal cord (in the lumbar and sacral areas). Each of the two branches 
of the sciatic nerve is about as wide as a thumb.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Each threads through the pelvis and deep into either side of the buttocks.
</li> </ul> Each then passes down the hip and along the back of the thigh to 
the foot. 
<p><strong><br>
 Low Back Pain </strong></p><br>
Low back pain is usually 
defined as either<i>acute</i> or <i>chronic</i>. 
<ul> 
<li> Acute low back pain lasts less than a month and is not caused by serious 
medical conditions. Most cases clear up in a few days without medical 
attention, although recurrence after a first attack is common.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Chronic low back pain persists beyond six months. It constitutes only 1% 
to 5% of all low back pain cases. </li> </ul> The source of low back pain can 
be from abnormalities in one or more of the many structures in the spine: 
<ul> 
<li> Injuries and small fractures can occur. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Muscle spasms can cause pain. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pressure on a weakened disc may cause it to rupture so the nucleus 
pulposus protrudes out from the spinal column, a condition known as a<i>
herniated disc</i>. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The facets can become misaligned or deteriorate. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The spinal canal itself can become narrowed, a disorder called <i>spinal 
stenosis</i>. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Scar tissue in the lower spine can trap nerves. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Sciatica</strong></p><br>
At some time, up to 40% of people 
experience pain, known as<b><i>sciatica</i></b>, which occurs when the sciatic 
nerve is trapped or inflamed.<br>
<br>
<i>Causes of Sciatica. </i> A herniated 
disc pressing on the sciatic nerve is the most common cause of this problem, 
although spinal stenosis or other vertebral abnormalities that press on the 
sciatic nerve can also cause pain. [<i>See</i> What Causes the Pain in Low Back 
Pain or Sciatica?.]<br>
<br>
<i>Symptoms of Sciatica. </i>Symptoms of sciatica 
involve the following: 
<ul> 
<li> The sensation of sciatica is usually experienced along the course of the 
sciatic nerve, which travels from the lower back, through the buttock, into the 
calf, and sometimes even the foot.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The pain can vary widely, from a mild tingling to pain, to a dull ache, 
to a burning sensation, to pain severe enough to cause immobility.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> It most often occurs on one side. Some people experience sharp pain in 
one part of the leg or hip and numbness in other parts. The affected leg may 
feel weak.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The pain often starts slowly and typically worsens at night. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> The pain increases after prolonged standing or sitting. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> It is often aggravated by sneezing, coughing, or laughing. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Patients may also experience it after bending backwards or walking more 
than 50 to 100 yards, particularly if it is caused by spinal stenosis.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> The pain usually resolves within six weeks with mild activity. </li> </ul>
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT CAUSES THE PAIN IN LOW BACK PAIN OR SCIATICA? </strong>
</p><br>
In about 85% of back pain cases, the origin of the pain is unknown and 
even imaging studies usually fail to determine the cause. 
<p><strong><br>
 Herniated Disc and Other Disc Abnormalities </strong></p><br>

Disc herniation and disc degeneration due to aging are the most common causes 
of low back pain. Other problems can also cause this pain, however.<br>
<br>
<i>
Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease.</i> Over the years, the disc can degenerate 
and produce low-grade inflammation and irritation. This age-related condition 
is the major source of chronic low back pain.<br>
<br>
<i>Herniated Disc. </i> 
A herniated disc, sometimes, but incorrectly, called a slipped disc, is widely 
held to be the most common cause of severe back pain and sciatica. A disc in 
the lumbar area becomes herniated when it ruptures or thins out and degenerates 
to the point that the gelatin within the disc protrudes outward.<br>
<br>
 It 
is commonly believed that that low back pain most often occurs if this material
<i>extrudes</i> (that is, it balloons into the area outside the vertebrae or 
breaks off from the disc) far enough out to press against the nerve root, most 
often the sciatic nerve. Recently, however, researchers are finding that the 
presence of such a pinched nerve does not necessarily relate to the severity of 
the pain. In fact, as people age, disc bulging and protrusion are very common 
occurrences, and in most cases do not cause any back pain. And, sciatica pain 
is sometimes present when there is no bulging or extruding of the discs. 
Experts increasingly believe, then, that low back pain associated with disc 
abnormalities may result from factors other then compressed nerves.<br>
<br>
<i>
The Annular Ring.</i> Increasingly, research is focusing on tears in the 
annular ring, which is the fibrous band that surrounds and protects the disc. 
The annular ring contains a dense nerve network and high levels of peptides 
that heighten perception of pain: 
<ul> 
<li> Tears in the annular ring are a frequent finding in patients with 
degenerative disk disease.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some<i> </i>cases of chronic low back pain may be caused by inward growth 
of nerve fibers into the annular ring, which trigger pain within the 
intervertebral. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Muscle and Ligament Injuries </strong></p><br>
Other than 
age-related degenerative disk disorders injuries in the muscles and ligaments 
supporting the back are the major causes of low back pain. 
<p><strong><br>
 Spinal Stenosis </strong></p><br>
Spinal stenosis is the 
narrowing of the spinal canal. This typically develops as a person ages and the 
discs become drier and start to shrink. At some point in this process, any 
disruption, such as a minor injury that results in disc inflammation, can cause 
impingement on the nerve root and trigger pain. Pain from spinal stenosis can 
occur in both legs or can cause sciatic pain. Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in 
the elderly with degenerative osteoarthritis, but it can sometimes be caused by 
other problems, including infection and birth defects. 
<p><strong><br>
 Miscellaneous Abnormalities </strong></p><br>
A number of 
conditions that affect the joints, vertebrae, or nerve roots can cause back 
pain: 
<ul> 
<li> Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one vertebra has slipped 
forward over the other. This is also a cause of sciatica.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The facet joints can wear down. In such cases, pain occurs on arching the 
back or when walking.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In some cases a segment (consisting of two vertebra and their common 
joint and disc) becomes unstable when its parts wear down.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Some patients may have scar tissue that traps the nerve roots in the 
lower spine and causes sciatica. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Piriformis Syndrome </strong></p><br>
Some experts believe 
that one cause of sciatica pain is the entrapment of the sciatic nerve deep in 
the buttock by the<i>piriformis</i> muscle. It usually develops after an 
injury. Others believe there is no real evidence that this condition, known as 
piriformis syndrome, causes any sciatic pain.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT CONDITIONS MAKE PEOPLE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOW BACK PAIN? 
</strong></p><br>
In most known cases, pain begins with an injury, after 
lifting a heavy object, or after making an abrupt movement. A number of 
conditions may make people more or less susceptible to low back pain from such 
events. In 85% of back pain cases, the causes are unknown. 
<p><strong><br>
 Aging Process </strong></p><br>
Intervertebral discs begin 
deteriorating and growing thinner by age 30. One-third of adults over 20 show 
evidence of herniated discs (although only 3% of these discs cause symptoms). 
As people continue to age and the discs lose moisture and shrink, the risk for 
spinal stenosis increases. The incidence of low back pain and sciatica 
increases in women at the time of menopause as they lose bone density. In the 
older adults, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are also common. However, the 
risk for low back pain does not mount steadily with ever-increasing age, which 
suggests that at a certain point, the conditions causing low back pain plateau. 
<p><strong><br>
 Genetic Factors </strong></p><br>
<i>Inherited Spinal 
Structure Abnormalities.</i> Many people have a genetic susceptibility to low 
back pain, usually from inheriting spinal structural abnormalities.<br>
<br>
<i>
Abnormalities in Disk Strength.</i>Studies are finding that specific mutations 
of the COL9A gene may play a role in about 10% of sciatica cases. The gene is 
normally involved in producing collagen, the protein building block in all 
structural tissue in the body. When defective, it may cause the disk to be less 
able to resist compressive forces. One 2001 study found the defective gene was 
present in twice as many patients with disk problems as in patients without 
back pain.<br>
<br>
<b>Central Nervous System Abnormalities </b><br>
<br>
 
After episodes of back pain, some people may experience changes in brain 
function that lead them to experience chronic back pain. Such changes include 
an exaggerated response in nerve cells or other factors that cause a persistent 
perception of pain even without an actual physical injury. 
<p><strong><br>
 Osteoarthritis</strong></p><br>
Osteoarthritis occurs in 
joints where cartilage is damaged and then destroyed. In reaction to this 
destruction, the bones associated with the joints develop abnormalities. 
(Rheumatoid arthritis, which is an arthritic condition caused by inflammation 
in the joints, can damage joints throughout the body, but rarely affects the 
lower back.) When osteoarthritis affects the spine, it may damage the cartilage 
in the discs, the moving joints of the spine, or both. The nerves may become 
pinched, causing pain and in advanced cases, numbness and muscle weakness. The 
patient may also experience muscle spasms and diminished mobility. 
<p><strong><br>
 Psychologic and Social Factors </strong></p><br>

Psychological factors are known to play a strong influential role in three 
phases of low back pain: 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Onset of pain. </i> Although disc abnormalities are certainly a cause 
of low back pain, many people with disc rupture or tears do not experience back 
pain. And some people without disc abnormalities complain of back pain. 
Research now indicates that in many people, preexisting depression and the 
inability to cope may be more likely to predict the onset of pain than physical 
abnormalities.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>The perception of pain. </i> Social and psychologic factors play a 
role in how severely someone experiences pain. People who are depressed are 
more likely to have vague physical symptoms, including low back pain. For 
example, in one study of truck drivers and bus drivers, nearly all the truck 
drivers liked their work and their bosses while bus drivers reported much lower 
job satisfaction. Half the truck drivers reported low back pain but only 24% 
lost time at work. Bus drivers with back pain had a significantly higher 
absentee rate in spite of less stress on their backs. Similarly, another study 
found that pilots (who generally reported &quot;loving&quot; their jobs) 
reported far fewer back problems than their flight crews. And yet another study 
reported that low rank, low social support, and high stress in soldiers was 
associated with a higher risk for disabling back pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Chronic pain. </i> The way a patient perceives and copes with pain at 
the beginning of an acute attack may actually condition the patient to either 
recover or develop a chronic condition. Those who over-respond to pain tend to 
feel out of control and become discouraged, increasing their risk for long-term 
problems. One study, in fact, reported that in patients with existing back 
problems, the fear of pain was actually more disabling than the pain itself. 
</li> </ul> It should be strongly noted that the presence of psychological 
factors in no way diminishes the reality of the pain and its disabling effects. 
Recognizing it as a strong player in many cases of low back pain, however, can 
help determine the full range of treatment options. 
<p><strong><br>
 Pregnancy</strong></p><br>
Pregnant women are prone to back 
pain due to a shifting of abdominal organs, the forward redistribution of body 
weight, and the loosening of ligaments in the pelvic area as the body prepares 
for delivery. Tall people are at higher risk than short people. 
<p><strong><br>
 Osteoporosis</strong></p><br>
Osteoporosis is a disease of 
the skeleton in which the amount of calcium present in the bones slowly 
decreases to the point where the bones become fragile and prone to fracture. It 
usually does not cause pain unless the vertebrae collapse suddenly, when pain 
is often severe. Studies indicate, however, that the incidence of low back pain 
and sciatica increase around the time of menopause, and very tiny fractures in 
the vertebrae caused by osteoporosis may be an undetected cause of back pain in 
many elderly women. 
<p><strong><br>
 Infections</strong></p><br>
Infections are a common cause of 
back pain. Osteomyelitis is infection in the spine, a rare cause of back pain. 
Other infections that cause back pain include Lyme disease, septic arthritis, 
bacterial endocarditis, Reiter's syndrome, mycobacterial and fungal arthritis, 
and viral arthritis. Chronic uterine or pelvic infections can cause low back 
pain in women. 
<p><strong><br>
 Atherosclerosis</strong></p><br>
Atherosclerosis (commonly 
called hardening of the arteries) reduces blood supply in the arteries. 
Although mainly known as a cause of heart disease, atherosclerosis can also 
reduce the supply of blood to the back and cause chronic low back pain. When it 
blocks arteries in the legs (a condition called intermittent claudication) it 
may resemble sciatica. 
<p><strong><br>
 Ankylosing Spondylitis </strong></p><br>
Ankylosing 
spondylitis is a chronic inflammation of the spine that may gradually result in 
a fusion of the spine. Symptoms include a slow development of back discomfort, 
with pain lasting for more than three months. The back is usually stiff in the 
morning; pain improves with exercise. In severe cases, the patient must 
continually stoop over. It can be quite mild, however, and it rarely affects a 
person's ability to work. It occurs mostly in young Caucasians in their 
mid-twenties. The disease is more common in men, but about 30% of the cases are 
in women. Researchers believe that in most cases it is hereditary. About 20% of 
people with inflammatory bowel disease and about 20% of people with psoriasis 
develop a form of ankylosing spondylitis. 
<p><strong><br>
 Muscular Abnormalities </strong></p><br>
Some research is 
suggesting that some people have motor control abnormalities in the deep 
muscles near the spine. Such lack of control causes instability in the spine 
that can lead to pain. 
<p><strong><br>
 Other Medical Conditions </strong></p><br>
Sometimes back 
pain can be caused by problems in other organs, usually near the spine, which 
is then called referred pain. These conditions can include ulcers, kidney 
disease (including kidney stones), ovarian cysts, and pancreatitis. 
Inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis can produce inflammation in 
the spine (<b><i>sacroiliitis</i></b>). Back pain can also be due to abscesses, 
blood clots, and cancer. Fibromyalgia (also called fibrositis or fibromyositis) 
is a syndrome that causes chronic, sometimes debilitating muscle pain and 
fatigue. In older people, low back pain may be a sign of Paget's disease or 
Parkinson's. [For more information see the<i></i> Report <i>Fibromyalgia.</i>] 
<p><strong><br>
 Medications</strong></p><br>
Medications may trigger back 
pain. For example, anticoagulants can cause bleeding or an internal bruise. 
Long-term steroid use can cause infection or compression fractures. 
<p><strong><br>
 Conditions that Cause Back Pain in Children </strong></p><br>

Persistent low back pain in children is more likely to have a serious cause 
that requires treatment than back pain in adults. According to one small study, 
one third of children being treated at a hospital for back pain were found to 
have serious underlying problems. Among the conditions that cause back pain in 
children are the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Spondylolytis are stress fractures in the spine. They are a common cause 
of back pain in young athletes. (Sometimes a fracture may not show up for a 
week or two after an injury.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Hyperlordosis is an inborn exaggerated inward curve in the lumbar area. 
(Scoliosis, an abnormal curvature of the spine in children, does not usually 
cause back pain.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Injuries. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Benign tumors (eg, osteoblastoma or neurofibroma). <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Cancers, including leukemia. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Juvenile chronic arthropathy. This is an inherited form of arthritis that 
can cause pain in the sacrum and hip joints of children and young people. It 
used to be grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis but is now defined as a 
separate problem. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE LIFESTYLE RISK FACTORS FOR LOW BACK PAIN? 
</strong></p><br>
Between 60% and 90% of the population experience back pain at 
one time or another during their lifetimes. Every year, nearly 15% of American 
adults visit their doctors because of low back pain episodes. Men and women are 
equally at risk. Low back pain is second only to upper respiratory infections 
(such as colds and flus) as the reason for seeing a doctor. In its costs to the 
country, it is second only to cancer and heart disease. 
<p><strong><br>
 High-Risk Occupations </strong></p><br>
In one study, 16 out 
of 100 warehouse workers reported back injuries in one year, and in two major 
food service organizations 30% of all injuries involved the back. A major study 
of work-related injuries reported that, in 1994, there were nearly 330,000 
cases of back injury due to overexertion in handling objects.<br>
<br>
 Jobs 
that involve lifting and forceful movements, bending and twisting into awkward 
positions, and whole-body vibration (usually caused by long-distance truck 
driving) place workers at particular risk for low back pain. The longer a 
person is on such jobs, the higher the risk. Some workers wear back support 
belts, but evidence strongly suggests that they are useful only for people who 
are currently suffering from low back pain. They offer little added support for 
the back and do not prevent back injuries. In fact, in one study workers who 
wore the belt for prevention reported more back pain than the workers who 
didn't wear them.<br>
<br>
 A number of companies are developing programs to 
protect against back injuries. Although studies are mixed on the effects of 
company interventions, one analysis suggested that they do have a positive 
effect. Employers and workers, however, should make every effort to create a 
safe working environment. Office workers should have chairs, desks, and 
equipment that support the back or help maintain good posture. 
<p><strong><br>
 Improper or Intense Exercise </strong></p><br>
On the other 
side of the coin, improper or excessive exercise is also an important risk 
factor for back pain. 
<ul> 
<li> The effect of high-impact exercise on the back is not entirely clear. 
Some research suggests that over time, it may increase the risk for 
degenerative disc disease. A survey of people who played tennis, however, found 
no increased risk for low back pain or sciatica.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Between 30% and 70% of cyclists experience low back pain. (One 1999 study 
reported that 70% of cyclists reported improvement simply by adjusting the 
angle of the bicycle seat.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Improper exercise instruction and inattention to mechanics can be sources 
of sudden trouble. As examples, a single jerky golf swing or incorrect use of 
exercise equipment (especially free weights, nautilus, and rowing machines) can 
cause serious back injuries. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Sedentary Lifestyle </strong></p><br>
People who do not 
exercise regularly face an increased risk for low back pain, especially during 
times when they suddenly embark on stressful unaccustomed activity, such as 
shoveling, digging, or moving heavy items. Although no definitive studies have 
been done to prove the relationship between lack of exercise and low back pain, 
sedentary living is probably a primary nonmedical culprit contributing to this 
condition. Lack of exercise leads to the following conditions that may threaten 
the back: 
<ul> 
<li> Muscle inflexibility (can restrict the back's ability to move, rotate, 
and bend).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Weak stomach muscles (can increase the strain on the back and can cause 
an abnormal tilt of the pelvis).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Weak back muscles (may increase the load on the spine and the risk for 
disc compression).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Obesity, associated with sedentary lifestyle (may put more weight on the 
spine and increase pressure on the vertebrae and discs). Studies report only a 
weak association between obesity and low back pain, however. </li> </ul>

The likelihood of experiencing back pain increases as 
children age, and pain is more common among girls than boys, according to a 
1999 study. A common cause of temporary back pain is carrying backpacks that 
are too heavy for children (more than 20% of their body weight, or even less 
for very young children). 
<p><strong><br>
 Other Risk Factors </strong></p><br>
Smokers are at higher 
risk for back problems, perhaps because smoking decreases blood circulation, 
but the association may also be due to an unhealthy lifestyle in general.<br>

<br> 
<p><strong><br>
 HOW SERIOUS IS LOW BACK PAIN OR SCIATICA? </strong></p><br>

<b>Outlook for Uncomplicated Low Back Pain </b><br>
<br>
 Studies now suggest 
that more patients have chronic back pain than previously believed. About a 
third of patients with uncomplicated low back pain are significantly improved 
after a week and two thirds have recovered by seven weeks. Within six months, 
however, some research suggests that 40% of patients experience another bout of 
back pain. In another survey, over a one-year period following treatment only 
21% of patients had no recurring back pain. Over four years, less than half 
were symptom-free. Some physicians are approaching the problem as they would 
any chronic illness, one that is not necessarily curable and that needs a 
consistent on-going approach.<br>
<br>
 Specific conditions can determine the 
rate of improvement: 
<ul> 
<li> In the majority of patients with herniated disks, the condition improves 
(although the actual physical improvement may be slower than the reduction in 
pain.) Researchers attempted to identify factors most likely to predict an 
elevated risk for recurrent pain and found that only depression was a 
significant factor in the majority of those who had not recovered.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Spinal stenosis stabilizes in about 70% of cases and worsens in 15%. Only 
about 15% of these patients improve. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Effects on Work </strong></p><br>
Studies have found that 
when people stay home because of back injury, only 65% are back within a week 
and nearly 14% are still absent at one month. And, if someone is on disability 
for more than six months, the person has only a 50% chance of returning to work.
<br> <br>
 Low back pain accounts for significant losses in work days and 
dollars. In 1990, it cost the US $23 billion in direct medical costs and 
possibly as much as $85 billion in total costs (such as lost productivity. 
Chronic back pain has become one of the most expensive causes of disability 
among workers under the age of 45. One study found that although severe back 
pain comprised only 10% of workers compensation cases it accounted for 86% of 
compensation costs. 
<p><strong><br>
 Cauda Equina Syndrome </strong></p><br>
Cauda equina syndrome 
is the impingement of the cauda equina (the four strands of nerves leading 
through the lowest part of the spine) and can have severe complications in the 
bowel or bladder. It is an emergency condition. It is usually caused by massive 
extrusion of the disc material. Cauda equina syndrome can cause permanent 
incontinence if not promptly treated with surgery. Symptoms of the syndrome 
include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Dull back pain. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Weakness or numbness in buttocks, genital area, or thigh. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> An inability to control urination or defecation. Pain accompanied by 
fever can indicate an infection. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Warning Signs for Serious Underlying Problems </strong></p>
<br> Certain warning signs should alert a patient to see a physician 
immediately for low back pain. Any very severe back pain warrants attention, 
particularly if any of the following conditions are present: 
<ul> 
<li> Being over 50. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Recent injury. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Severe pain. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain awakens the person at night. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain accompanied by fever (possible infection). <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain increased by lying down. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain unrelated to movement. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain lasts for a month, and is accompanied by unexplained fever or weight 
loss. (Possible indication of a tumor particularly in people with a history of 
cancer).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> History or chronic use of corticosteroids. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Intravenous drug use. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> History of urinary tract infection. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In children, any severe neck or back pain or pain that persists for more 
than three days. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 HOW IS LOW BACK PAIN OR SCIATICA DIAGNOSED? </strong></p><br>

Because nearly all cases of low back pain clear up in a short time and are not 
due to serious problems, a medical history and a brief physical examination are 
almost always sufficient. If the physician suspects a serious underlying cause, 
the approach to determining the origin of back pain involves answering three 
questions: 
<ul> 
<li> Is some general medical disorder present that could be causing the pain? 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Are there social or emotional factors that might be intensifying the pain?
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Are the nerves in the spine involved in the pain (such as in sciatica)? 
</li> </ul> Such questions can usually be answered with a medical history and 
physical examination. 
<p><strong><br>
 Medical History </strong></p><br>
A medical and family 
history should include heart problems, cancer, arthritis, and any other serious 
conditions. The patient should report the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Previous episodes of back pain. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Any history of injuries or accidents involving the neck, back, or hips. 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Any indications of a serious underlying disease (eg, history of cancer, 
unexplained weight loss, chronic infection).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The frequency, duration, and the nature of the pain (eg, whether it is 
dull, piercing, throbbing, or burning).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The timing of back pain (whether it occurs at night or during the day). 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Events surrounding the onset and whether the pain was triggered by an 
event, such as lifting a heavy object. (Often, the patient cannot describe an 
event that produced the pain.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Any condition that worsens the pain (for example, coughing, exercise, 
straining during bowel movements, walking).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Any situation that relieves the pain (lying down, exercise). <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Problems with urination or defecation (symptom of cauda equina syndrome). 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Other relevant symptoms (eg, morning stiffness, weakness or numbness in 
the legs). </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Physical Examination </strong></p><br>
The main objectives of 
a physical examination are to attempt to locate the specific location of the 
pain source and to determine limits of movement: 
<ul> 
<li> Patients are asked to sit, stand, and walk in different ways 
(flat-footed, on the toes, and on their heels).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In some cases they are asked to walk on a treadmill to test for weakness 
in toe or heel walking (which may indicate stenosis).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Patients will be requested to bend forward, backward, and sideways and to 
twist.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Patients will be asked to lift their leg straight up while lying down. 
The physician will also move the patient's legs in different positions and bend 
and straighten the knees. (Pain caused by sciatica can be intensified by 
lifting the affected leg straight in the air. It is usually sharp, localized, 
and accompanied by numbness or tingling. Pain caused by inflammation is duller 
and more generalized and not affected by lifting a straight leg.)<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The physician may measure the circumference of the calves and thighs to 
look for muscle deterioration.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> To test nerve function and reflexes, physicians will tap the knees and 
ankles with a rubber hammer. The physician may also touch parts of the body 
lightly with a pin, cotton swab, or feather to test for numbness and nerve 
sensitivity. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Imaging Techniques </strong></p><br>
Imaging techniques such 
as x-rays or scans are rarely useful except under certain circumstances that 
may include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Pain that lasts more than a month. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Very severe pain, numbness. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Muscle weakness. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A previous accident or injury that might have affected the back. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A history of cancer or other indications of an underlying disease, such 
as fever or unexplained weight loss.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> In older patients (over 65 years of age). </li> </ul> If these conditions 
exist, usually an x-ray is used first. If results are inconclusive, either 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed. 
(Ultrasound is not useful.)<br>
<br>
<i>X-Rays</i> 
<ul> 
<li> Although many patients with acute and uncomplicated low back pain believe 
that plain x-rays of the spinal column are important in a diagnosis, they are 
not very helpful in most patients except for reducing anxiety. Experts 
recommend waiting six to eight weeks. If pain persists, then x-rays are usually 
warranted. In such cases, they may reveal signs of injury, infection, tumors, 
stenosis, or changes in the vertebrae that may be causing inflammation or 
compression on the nerve. In nearly all cases of early back pain, however, 
plain x-rays offer no benefit for diagnosis or determining treatment unless a 
specific underlying cause is suspected.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A <i>discography</i> is an x-ray of the disc. It requires injections into 
discs suspected of being the source of pain and discs nearby. It can be painful 
and is generally only used for patients who are undergoing back surgery to 
identify the location of the injured disc.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A <i>myelogram</i> is an x-ray of the spine that requires a spinal 
injection and the need to lie still for several hours to avoid a very painful 
headache. It has value only for select patients with pain on moving and 
standing. It has largely been replaced by CT and MRI scans. </li> </ul> <i>CT 
and MRI Scans.</i> Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
are not painful and can identify disc abnormalities. MRIs are more accurate 
than CTs and provide very well-defined images of soft tissue and bone. MRIs are 
able to detect annular tears or disc fragments and can detect non-spinal causes 
of back pain, including infection and cancer. They are expensive, however, and 
many experts believe they are overused and, in most cases of back pain, are not 
very useful. Reasons are as follows: 
<ul> 
<li> Studies have reported that MRIs miss between 6% and 23% of damaged discs 
that were revealed during surgery.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> More importantly, evidence now strongly suggests that the degree of disc 
abnormalities revealed by MRIs have very little to do with the severity of the 
pain or the need for surgery. Studies, in fact, indicate that at least 40% of<i>
all</i> adults have bulging or protruding vertebrae discs, and most have no 
back pain. Discs abnormalities in people who have back pain, then, may simply 
be a coincidence rather than an indication for treatment. Many experts now 
believe that relying on images of disc abnormalities to determine treatment has 
resulted in many unnecessary surgeries. </li> </ul> Advanced imaging techniques 
should be used only when underlying infection, cancer, or nerve involvement are 
suspected. Spinal abnormalities identified by MRIs often do not predict 
long-term problems. Three-dimensional CT scans and MRI refinements may soon 
make diagnosis more accurate.<br>
<br>
<i>Bone Scans and SPECT Imaging. </i> In 
rare cases, bone scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) may be used, such as when bone abnormalities are suspected from 
conditions that include spinal fracture, cancer that has spread to the bone, or 
osteoarthritis.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Tests </b><br>
<br>
 Blood and urine samples 
may be used to test for infections, arthritis, or other conditions. Injecting a 
drug that blocks pain into the nerves in the back helps locate the level in the 
spine where problems occur. A procedure called a facet block is also useful in 
locating areas of specific damage. Provocative discometry is a test that uses 
an injection of saline solution into the suspected disc to reproduce the pain, 
which is then followed by injection of an anesthetic to dull the pain.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE TREATMENTS FOR UNCOMPLICATED ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN?
</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 General Approach for Uncomplicated Acute Low Back Pain or 
Sciatica</strong></p><br>
For treating short-term acute low back pain, the best 
results derive from the least aggressive treatments. The general approach is 
the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Patients with no indication of any serious underlying cause should stay 
as active as possible within the limits of the back pain. (Bed rest is<i>not</i>
 recommended.) Studies suggest that a third of patients with uncomplicated low 
back pain are significantly improved after a week with no other treatment than 
normal activity and two thirds have recovered by seven weeks.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Physical therapy or spinal manipulations may be helpful if pain continues 
for more than two weeks.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The patients should seek a specialist if pain continues for more than a 
month (or less than this if there is indications for an underlying disorder, 
nerve damage, or injury). </li> </ul> Back pain attributed to medical 
conditions, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, or pregnancy, either resolves when 
the condition does or is treated as part of the overall therapeutic plan. 
<p><strong><br>
 Immediate Treatment of Acute Low Back Pain of Unknown Cause 
</strong></p><br>
<i>Specific Tips for Relieving Pain. </i>At the onset of 
acute low back pain when the cause is unknown the following tips may be helpful:
<ul> 
<li> Although bed rest is no longer recommended, the patient should stop 
normal physical activities for the first couple of days in order to calm 
symptoms.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Over-the-counter pain relievers often provide significant benefits. 
Muscle relaxants may be helpful in some patients. Once started, medications 
should be taken on a regular schedule in order to maintain consistent 
effectiveness.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Many people find that alternating ice packs and heating pads is helpful 
in relieving the pain. Some people recommend changing from hot to cold every 
three minutes and repeating this sequence three times. (Some experts believe 
ice packs should be applied first.) This regimen should be performed two or 
three times during the day. (Heat or cold treatments do not have much effect on 
sciatica.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Supportive back belts, braces, or corsets may help some people 
temporarily, but they can reduce muscle tone over time and should be used only 
briefly.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Healthy sleep plays a vital role in recovery. It is often difficult to 
get a good night's sleep when suffering from back pain, particularly because 
the pain can intensify at night. Take a warm bath before bedtime, and practice 
relaxation techniques. It may be necessary to take medication to help manage 
nighttime pain or treat sleeplessness. To help promote sleep, avoid caffeine in 
the afternoon and evening. Lying curled up in a fetal position with a pillow 
between the knees or lying on the back with a pillow under the knees may help. 
Pregnant women with back pain may find some relief by placing a specially 
shaped pillow (eg, Ozzlo Pillow) under the abdomen while sleeping.<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Although not intensively studied, patients report that massage therapy is 
helpful in some cases. It is is proving to be very helpful for back pain in the 
acute and chronic phases.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Spinal manipulation may be helpful but some experts recommend delaying 
this treatment until pain has persisted for three weeks, if possible, since in 
many patients the back pain will have resolved on its own by then. </li> </ul> 
<b>Treatments that Provide no Benefits </b><br>
<br>
 Patients should be aware 
of and avoid certain approaches that are not helpful and, in some cases may be 
harmful for acute low back pain: 
<ul> 
<li> Bed rest. Bed rest for low back pain, including most cases of sciatica, 
is no more effective and may even be worse than simply continuing normal 
activities to the degree possible. Long-term bed rest results in loss of muscle 
tone and bone strength, increases susceptibility to blood clots, and causes 
depression and lethargy.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Exercise in the acute phases of low back pain. Intense exercise and 
physical activity should be avoided during acute back pain, particularly heavy 
lifting and trunk twisting. (Specific exercises can be important during 
recovery, however, as well as for patients with chronic low back pain.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Acupuncture. Acupuncture has not proven to have any value for acute low 
back pain in most patients, but may provide some help for patients with chronic 
low back pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Magnet therapy. Permanent bipolar magnets have gained some popularity as 
a non-invasive method of relieving pain. To date no studies support such claims 
and one 2000 study reported no effect in alleviating low back pain. It should 
be noted that magnets can deactivate heart devices and must be kept at least 
six inches away from pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators. 
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Resuming Normal Activity </strong></p><br>
Experts now 
recommend that people with acute low back pain attempt to resume normal 
activities as soon as possible. They should be conducted without strain or 
stretching. Simply letting pain be the guide is the best approach for achieving 
movement. In general, normal activity should be resumed in a gradual fashion as 
soon as the patient feels ready, reserving therapeutic exercises until after 
the acute pain has resolved.<br>
<br>
<b>Spinal Manipulation </b><br>
<br>
<i>
Spinal Manipulation for Uncomplicated Acute Low Back Pain.</i> If pain persists 
beyond two to three weeks, at least one session of spinal manipulation may be a 
useful treatment. There are a number of variations, but one example of a spinal 
manipulation technique is the following: 
<ul> 
<li> The patient first lies on his or her side. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The practitioner grasps the exposed shoulder and either the hip or knee 
and then presses the upper and lower portions of the body in opposite 
directions, so that the torso rotates.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The shifting vertebrae make a cracking or popping sound, indicating that 
they have exceeded the normal range of motion.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Often this results in a greater sense of ease and mobility. (The effect, 
however, may be temporary). </li> </ul> Controversy exists over whether 
on-going manipulations after a first visit work any better for relieving pain 
than simply gradually resuming normal activity. Some patients consider spinal 
manipulation to be highly effective for chronic low back pain as well, although 
evidence in this case is much weaker. Methodological problems have clouded the 
results of many studies on manipulation techniques, and it is difficult to draw 
valid conclusions from most of them.<br>
<br>
<i>Chiropractic or Osteopathy. 
</i> Spinal manipulations are typically performed by chiropractors but 
osteopathic doctors also perform them. 
<ul> 
<li> One in three people with low back pain seek treatment from a 
chiropractor. Chiropractic was founded in the US in the late 1800s and has been 
associated throughout its history with shamanism and folklore as well as with 
potentially genuine health benefits. There has not been a clear consensus even 
among its own practitioners about its specific goals. Nevertheless, there is a 
strong movement within the practice aimed at a scientific and realistic 
approach. The specific goal of chiropractors is to perform spinal manipulations 
to improve nerve transmission. Many studies have now confirmed that patients 
feel more satisfied with their chiropractic care than with treatment from 
general practitioners. (An analysis of studies reported that chiropractic 
treatment was beneficial but not significantly better than sham treatments. 
Interestingly, standard medical treatments had<i>worse</i> results than both 
chiropractic and sham treatments.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Osteopathy was also founded in the 1800s and also involves physical 
manipulation as its core approach to healing. Unlike chiropractic, however, 
osteopathy uses manipulation of the bones, muscles, and tendons to optimize 
blood circulation. In addition, the general direction of osteopathy over the 
years has widened to employ a broader range of treatments that now approach 
those of standard medicine. One 1999 study reported that osteopathy was as 
effective as medical treatment in relieving low back pain and patients required 
far less medication and physical therapy. Osteopathic treatment was also far 
less expensive. </li> </ul> <i>Positive Emotional Effects. </i> Both 
chiropractors and osteopaths offer verbal assurance and a precise treatment 
regimen. The direct physical connection through spinal manipulation reinforces 
the patient-practitioner relationship. The emotional effects of such 
connections may be as important for healing as the treatments themselves. 
Chiropractors offer a further psychologic advantage, which is availability to 
their patients. Many medical doctors believe that because low back pain is 
self-limited and resolves, the patient can wait for an appointment. A 
chiropractor, however, is more likely to accept to a patient promptly.<br>
<br>

<i>Adverse Effects. </i> Mild and temporary side effects from spinal 
manipulation are common.<br>
<br>
 The potential for serious adverse effects 
from low back manipulations is low. It should be strongly noted, however, that 
serious complications (including stroke or spinal cord or neck injury) have 
been reported with manipulations of the<i>neck</i>. Although little research 
has been done on such complications, an English survey indicated that they are 
more frequent than commonly thought.<br>
<br>
 Some chiropractors overuse 
x-rays, particularly those of the full spine, which may have harmful 
consequences.<br>
<br>
 Patients should also be aware that some chiropractors 
use alternative treatments that have not been proven or rigorously studied. All 
patients should require objective evidence on the benefits of their treatments. 
<p><strong><br>
 Muscle Relaxants </strong></p><br>
A combination of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants such as 
cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), diazepam (Valium), carisoprodol (Soma), or 
methocarbamol (Robaxin) may be useful for some patients with acute low back 
pain. Some experts argue, however, that it is not clear which patients would 
benefit from them. In fact, in some people the tensed back muscles may be 
protecting the damaged disc or vertebrae, in which case medication to relax 
them could be harmful.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE THE TREATMENTS FOR CHRONIC BACK PAIN OF UNKNOWN 
CAUSES?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Approach for Patients with Chronic Back Pain of Unknown Causes
</strong></p><br>
A major review of 12 studies indicated that only intensive 
treatment using a combination of physical and psychologic rehabilitation 
programs reduced pain and improved function in patients with chronic low back 
pain. It should be noted that even with the best treatments, patients with 
chronic back pain may not experience complete pain relief and may need to 
develop methods for improving daily life in the face of some persistent pain.
<br> <br>
 Massage therapy may be helpful for pain that has persisted for more 
than three weeks. [See What Are Treatments for Uncomplicated Acute Low Back 
Pain?] 
<ul> 
<li> Exercise and Physical Therapy. Specific and regular exercise under the 
guidance of a trained professional is important for reducing pain and improving 
function, although it is often very difficult to sustain. [<i>See</i> What Is 
the Role of Exercise and Movement in Low Back Pain?<i>.</i>]<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Antidepressants. In some patients antidepressants may be helpful, 
particularly those known as tricyclics.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Pain Relievers. Patients often take pain-relievers, particularly NSAIDs, 
although they can have severe effects on the gastrointestinal tract over time. 
Newer agents called COX-2 inhibitors may have fewer effects on the GI tract, 
but their long-term safety is unknown. Some physicians have recommended 
long-term opioids for patients with severe chronic pain, but studies suggest 
they do not improve activity levels and can have significant side effects.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. This form of psychologic therapy helps 
change behavior and attitudes toward pain, and may be helpful for dealing with 
pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Nerve Blocks. Procedures that block nerves in the pelvic area may be used 
in severe cases. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) </strong></p>
<br> The most commonly prescribed medications for the treatment of chronic back 
pain are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These agents block 
prostaglandins, the substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation 
and pain.<br>
<br>
<i>Common NSAIDs. </i>There are dozens of NSAIDs. Some of 
the most common are aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen, but many 
others are now available. [For other NSAIDs,<i>see Box </i> Ulcers and 
Gastrointestinal Bleeding<i>.</i>] Regular use of even over-the-counter NSAIDs 
may be hazardous for anyone and has been associated with the following side 
effects: 
<ul> 
<li> Ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. This is the major danger with 
long-term use of NSAIDs. [<i>See Box </i> Ulcers and Gastrointestinal Bleeding 
<i>.</i>] <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Increased blood pressure. This is a particular problem for those on 
medications to reduce hypertension. Piroxicam (Feldene), naproxen (Aleve), and 
indomethacin (Indocin) appear to pose the greatest risks for high blood 
pressure. (Sulindac has the smallest effect.) People with hypertension, severe 
vascular disease, kidney or liver problems, and those taking diuretics must be 
closely monitored if they need to take NSAIDs.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> They may delay the emptying of the stomach, which could interfere with 
the actions of other drugs. The elderly are at special risk.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Dizziness, ringing in the ear. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Headache.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Skin rash. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Depression has also been noted. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Confusion or bizarre sensation (in some higher-potency NSAIDs, such as 
indomethacin).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Kidney abnormalities have been reported in people taking NSAIDs, which 
resolves when the drugs are withdrawn. Any sudden weight gain or swelling 
should be reported to a physician.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Diabetics taking oral hypoglycemics may need to adjust the dosage if they 
also need to take NSAIDs because of possible harmful interactions between the 
drugs. </li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 Ulcers and Gastrointestinal Bleeding </strong></p><br>
NSAIDs 
are a major cause of ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 
Gastrointestinal complications from the use of NSAIDs account for almost 
100,000 hospitalizations and at least 16,000 deaths a year in the United 
States. Bleeding and ulcers can occur at any time, with or without symptoms. 
One study indicated that taking NSAIDs for only six months posed a risk for 
symptomatic ulcers that was greater than 1%. The risk for bleeding is 
continuous as long as a patient is on these drugs and may even persist as long 
as a year after the drug is discontinued. Alcohol abuse may increase the risk 
for GI bleeding when taking NSAIDs. Because NSAIDs reduce the clotting of the 
blood, anyone undergoing surgery should stop taking the medication a week 
before the operation.<br>
<br>
<i>Ulcer Risk for Specific NSAIDs. </i>One study 
ranked the sixteen most commonly used NSAIDs according to risk for ulcers and 
bleeding. 
<ul> 
<li> Lowest Risk: nabumetone (Relafen), etodolac (Lodine), salsalate, and 
sulindac (Clinoril).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Medium risk: diclofenac (Voltaren), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, 
Rufen), aspirin, naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox), and tolmetin 
(Tolectin). (Drugs within this group vary in risk. Studies show, for example, 
that short-term use of naproxen is twice as likely as ibuprofen to be 
associated with hospitalization from GI bleeding. Although ketoprofen (Actron, 
Orudis KT) was considered a medium-risk drug, another study reported that even 
one week of taking the drug at low doses causes significant GI injury. </li> 
</ul> Highest risk: flurbiprofen (Ansaid), piroxicam (Feldene), fenoprofen, 
indomethacin (Indocin), meclofenamate (Meclomen), and oxaprozin.<br>
<br>
<i>
Drugs for Prevention of NSAID-Induced Ulcers.</i>For people who need to take 
NSAIDs regularly, some agents are available that may protect against bleeding 
and ulcers. 
<ul> 
<li> Proton-pump inhibitors include omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole 
(Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and pantoprozole. Proton pump inhibitors are 
possibly the most protective agents and can actually heal existing ulcers. 
Their use has been demonstrated to reduce NSAID-ulcer rates by as much as 80% 
compared with no treatment.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Misoprostol.</i> Misoprostol is a prostaglandin, the protective 
substance blocked by NSAID use. It protects against the major intestinal 
toxicity of NSAIDs. It is used to prevent NSAID-induced ulcers, both duodenal 
and gastric, but is not useful in healing existing ulcers.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>H2 Blockers. </i>Some H2 blockers may help prevent NSAID-induced 
ulcers. These drugs are available over the counter and include famotidine 
(Pepcid AC), ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid). 
In one 2000 study, ranitidine and famotidine were associated with a lower risk 
for bleeding in patients taking NSAIDs, but another study found no protection 
from cimetidine. </li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>COX-2 Inhibitors. </i>
Celecoxib (Celebrex), rofecoxib (Vioxx), and meloxicam (Mobic) are known as 
COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors, the so-called super-aspirins.<br>
<br>
<i>
Benefits.</i>These agents may prove to be as effective and less harmful to the 
GI tract than NSAIDs. Importantly, studies are reporting a lower incidence of 
ulcers and other toxic side effects in patients taking the COX-2 inhibitors 
than in those taking NSAIDs. The drugs were all equally effective in relieving 
pain. (One study compared celecoxib with the NSAIDs ibuprofen or diclofenac and 
the other compared rofecoxib with the NSAID naproxen.) One 1999 study even 
found the rate of GI problems with celecoxib was equal to that in people who do 
not take NSAIDs at all. COX-2 inhibitors are currently more expensive than 
traditional NSAIDs, however, and some insurers do not pay for them.<br>
<br>
 
Theoretically, they may even have properties that produce less adverse effects 
on cartilage than NSAIDs may have.<br>
<br>
 Some early evidence also suggests 
they may be protective against colon cancer and possibly even Alzheimer's 
disease.<br>
<br>
<i>Possible Negative Effects. </i> In spite of their promise, 
some researchers theorize that inhibiting COX-2 may have some negative side 
effects over the long term: 
<ul> 
<li> Although COX-2 inhibitors are very likely to have a lower risk for ulcers 
and GI bleeding than standard NSAIDs, studies have been mixed on whether 
patients taking COX-2 inhibitors have the same gastrointestinal<i>symptoms</i> 
(eg, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) as standard NSAIDs. Vioxx may pose a 
higher risk for symptoms than Celebrex. (Other side effects found with 
short-term use include headache, and dizziness.)<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> One 2000 study observed that the COX-2 inhibitors had some adverse 
effects on kidney function, particularly in elderly people, that were similar 
to the effects of standard NSAIDs. This effect can also trigger fluid build up 
and high blood pressure. (Celebrex may have fewer of these effects than Vioxx.)
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may experience a higher risk for 
bleeding with the use of these agents.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Studies are reporting a higher incidence of heart attacks in patients 
taking Vioxx and possibly Celebrex than in those taking the standard NSAID 
naproxen. Some evidence suggests that both COX-2 inhibitors may increase the 
risk for blood clots. Experts also suggest that heart patients with chronic 
pain may be substituting COX-2 inhibitors for heart-protective NSAIDs (such as 
aspirin, ibuprofen, or possibly naproxen). Patients with heart disease who are 
taking low-dose aspirin should continue it even while they are taking COX-2 
inhibitors.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> A few cases of psychiatric side effects (hallucinations), fluid build up, 
high blood pressure, and excess potassium in the blood has been observed with 
higher doses of celecoxib or rofecoxib.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> They may have negative effects on pregnancy and fertility. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> No one who has allergic reactions, hives, or asthma from sulfa drugs, 
aspirin, or other NSAIDs, should take a COX-2 inhibitor.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> The use of COX-2 inhibitors can interfere with many other drugs taken 
concurrently, including many taken for heart disease and high blood pressure. 
Patients should discuss all other medications with their physician. </li> </ul> 
More research is needed to confirm or refute any possible hazard.<br>
<br>
<b>
Antidepressants</b><br>
<br>
 Some experts suggest that treating people with 
low back pain and depression for the psychological condition may be more 
beneficial and cost-effective than back treatments. Certain antidepressants, 
called tricyclics, can even be effective pain killers in<i>non-depressed </i>
people with chronic back pain. They include amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), 
desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), amoxapine 
(Asendin), nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), and maprotiline (Ludiomill). It 
should be noted that tricyclics can have severe side effects. Nonetheless, 
experts believe there is a useful role for these drugs that warrants further 
investigation. 
<p><strong><br>
 Potent Pain Relievers </strong></p><br>
<i>Opioids.</i> 
Unless the pain is very severe, experts advise against routinely prescribing 
pain killers containing opioids (eg, morphine, codeine, meperidine [Demerol], 
oxycodone [Oxycontin], or tramadol). A skin patch containing an opioid called 
transdermal fentanyl (Duragesic) may relieve chronic back pain more effectively 
than oral opioids. Side effects for all opioids include drowsiness, impaired 
judgment, nausea, and constipation. Addiction is a risk, although less than is 
commonly believed when these medications are used for pain relief. 
<p><strong><br>
 Stress Reduction and Behavioral Techniques </strong></p><br>

According to a 2001 review of studies, only intensive programs that include 
psychologic as well physical rehabilitation therapies were successful in 
reducing and improving function in patients with chronic low back pain.<br>
<br>
<i>Stress Reduction. </i> Stress reducing techniques, including relaxation 
methods and meditation, may be helpful. One study, for example, reported that 
meditation was beneficial in reducing pain and improving mood among chronic 
pain sufferers who had not responded to traditional care.<br>
<br>
<i>
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy.</i> Studies report that a course of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy helps reduce chronic back pain and enhances the 
patient's ability to deal with it. The primary goal of cognitive therapy in 
such cases is to change the distorted perceptions that patients have of 
themselves and their approach to pain. Using specific tasks and 
self-observation, patients gradually shift their fixed ideas that they are 
helpless against the pain that dominates their lives to the perception that 
pain is only one negative and, to a degree, a manageable experience among many 
positive ones. In one study, therapists also taught relaxation techniques and 
methods to improve posture. The sessions were two and a half hours each week 
for 12 weeks. More research is needed. 
<p><strong><br>
Massage Therapy</strong></p><br>
To date, no strong studies 
have been conducted to verify the effects of massage therapy. Small recent 
ones, however, have indicated that it is as effective as spinal manipulation 
and more effective than acupuncture or self-care. For example a 2001 study 
comparing massage therapy with Traditional Chinese Medical acupuncture and 
self-care found massage to be more effective than either at ten weeks and it 
produced significantly better results than the acupuncture after a year. (None 
of these approaches, however, offered complete relief.) 
<p><strong><br>
Vertebral Axial Decompression</strong></p><br>
Vertebral axial 
decompression (VAX-D) is proving to reduce pain and improve function in 
patients wwith chronic low back pain. The therapy employs a special table that 
controls adjustments along the lines of the spinal column. Some evidence 
supports its benefits. 
<p><strong><br>
Alternative Treatments </strong></p><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Herbal 
Remedies.</i> There have been claims for a number of herbal and so-called 
natural remedies for relief of back pain. One study of extracts of 
harpagophytum (a South African herb commonly called Devil's Claw or Grapple 
Plant) showed some promise. Herbal remedies for back pain may include relaxants 
such as black haw (viburnum prunifolium) or valerian (valeriana officinalis), 
anti-inflammatories such as turmeric (curcuma longa) or arnica montana (for 
external use only), circulatory stimulants such as gingko biloba or rosemary, 
and pain relievers such as white willow bark (salix alba). It should be 
strongly noted that if any substance has beneficial effects against serious 
illness it also, like any drug, most likely has side effects and may even be 
harmful for some people. In addition, herbal and so-called natural remedies are 
not regulated, few studies have been conducted on any of these products, and 
the quality or safety cannot be guaranteed. [See Warnings on Alternative and 
So-Called Natural Remedies.]<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 Warnings on Alternative and So-Called Natural Remedies 
</strong></p><br>
It should be strongly noted that alternative or natural 
remedies are not regulated and their quality is not publicly controlled. In 
addition, any substance that can affect the body's chemistry can, like any 
drug, produce side effects that may be harmful. Even if studies report positive 
benefits from herbal remedies, the compounds used in such studies are, in most 
cases, not what are being marketed to the public.<br>
<br>
 There have been a 
number of reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal 
products. In addition, some so-called natural remedies were found to contain 
standard prescription medication. Most problems reported occur in herbal 
remedies imported from Asia, with one study reporting a significant percentage 
of such remedies containing toxic metals.<br>
<br>
 The following website is 
building a database of natural remedy brands that it tests and rates. Not all 
are available yet.http://www.ConsumerLab.com/ <br>
<br>
 The Food and Drug 
Administration has a program called MEDWATCH for people to report adverse 
reactions to untested substances, such as herbal remedies and vitamins (call 
800-332-1088).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Transcutaneous Electric Nerve 
Stimulation.</i> Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) uses 
low-level electrical pulses to suppress back pain. The standard approach is to 
give 80 to 100 pulses per second for 45 minutes three times a day. The patients 
are barely aware of the sensation. A variant (sometimes called percutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation or PENS) applies these pulses through a small 
needle to acupuncture points. A 2000 analysis of studies report that either 
TENS or PENS appears to offer some relief for chronic low back pain, at least 
temporarily. PENS may be more effective. It may help men more than women. In 
any case, neither approach appears to be helpful for relief of acute low back 
pain in most patients.<br>
<br>
<i>Acupuncture.</i> Acupuncture is now a common 
alternative treatment for certain kinds of pain. It involves inserting small 
pins or exerting pressure on certain &quot;energy&quot; points in the body. 
When the needles have been placed successfully, the patient is supposed to 
experience a sensation known as Teh Chi, which brings a feeling of fullness, 
numbness, tingling, and warmth with some soreness around the acupuncture point. 
Unfortunately, the strongest evidence to date suggests that, in general, 
acupuncture does not have a major effect on low back pain. Still it may be 
helpful for certain patients with back pain, such as pregnant women, who must 
avoid medications. Anyone who has acupuncture should be sure it is performed in 
a reputable location with experienced practitioners who use sterilized 
equipment.<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF EXERCISE AND MOVEMENT IN LOW BACK PAIN?
</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 Resuming Activity Levels after Acute Back Pain </strong></p>
<br> Overexertion may be as unhelpful as prolonged bed rest during acute back 
pain. (In one study, recovery from acute back pain was slower for patients who 
immediately embarked on flexibility exercises than for those who gradually 
resumed normal activity.) Walking, stationary biking, swimming, and even light 
jogging, however, may begin within two weeks of symptoms. An incremental 
aerobic exercise program is less stressful than stretching or performing 
exercises that strengthen the trunk muscles. Patients should never force 
themselves to exercise if, by doing so, pain increases.<br>
<br>
<i>Exercises 
to Avoid during Recovery.</i>It should be strongly noted that incorrect 
movements or long-term high-impact exercise is a cause of back pain. People 
vulnerable to back pain should avoid activities that put undue stress on the 
lower back or require sudden twisting movements, such as football, golf, 
ballet, and weight lifting. Jogging is usually not recommended, at least not 
until the pain is gone and muscles are stronger. Exercises that put the lower 
back under pressure should be avoided until the back muscles are well toned. 
Such exercises include leg lifts done in a prone (face-down) position, straight 
leg sit-ups, and leg curls using exercise equipment. 
<p><strong><br>
 The Role of Physical Therapy </strong></p><br>
Physical 
therapy with a trained professional may be useful if pain has not improved 
within the first three weeks. It is, in fact, important for any person who has 
chronic low back pain to have an exercise program guided by professionals who 
understand the limitations and special needs of back pain and who can address 
individual health conditions. One study indicated that patients who planned 
their own exercise did worse than those in physical therapy or 
physician-directed programs.<br>
<br>
 Physical therapy typically includes the 
following: 
<ul> 
<li> The first stage involves patient education and training the patient in 
correct movement. Sometimes heat or electro-therapies are employed, although 
their benefits are unproven.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If back pain has continued beyond five weeks, physical therapy is used 
for rehabilitation. It employs exercises to help the patients keep the spine in 
neutral positions during all daily activities. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Exercise for Chronic Back Pain </strong></p><br>
Exercise 
plays a very beneficial role in chronic back pain. In one study, for example, 
patients with back pain lasting for an average of 18 months were assigned eight 
one-hour exercise sessions over four weeks. They showed greater improvement in 
nearly every area, including reduced pain and increased capacity, compared to 
patients who did not exercise. The positive benefits of exercise not only 
affect strength and flexibility but they also alter and improve the patients' 
attitudes toward their disability and pain.<br>
<br>
 Repetition is the key to 
increasing flexibility, building endurance, and strengthening the specific 
muscles needed to support and neutralize the spine. Some exercise programs used 
for prevention or for chronic low back pain include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Low Impact Aerobic Exercises. </i> Low-impact aerobic exercises, such 
as swimming, bicycling, and walking, can strengthen muscles in the abdomen and 
back without over-straining the back. Programs that use strengthening exercises 
while swimming may be a particularly beneficial approach for many patients with 
back pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Lumbar Extension Strength Training. </i> Exercises called lumbar 
extension strength training are proving to be effective. Generally, these 
exercises attempt to strengthen the abdomen, improve lower back mobility, 
strength, and endurance, and enhance flexibility in the hip and hamstring 
muscles and tendons at the back of the thigh. [For examples of some good 
exercises for the back,<i>see Box. </i>] <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Yoga, Tai Chi, and Chi Kung. </i> These exercises combine low-impact 
physical movements and meditation. They are based on principles of disciplining 
the mind to achieve a physical and mental balance and can be very helpful in 
preventing recurrences of lower back pain.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Flexibility Exercises. </i> Whether flexibility exercises alone offer 
any significant benefit is uncertain. One study suggested that any benefits 
derived from flexibility exercises are lost unless the exercise regimens are 
sustained.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Retraining Deep Muscles. </i> Of interest are studies that are finding 
a link between low back pain and impaired motor control of deep muscles of the 
back and trunk. According to these studies, contraction exercises specifically 
designed to retrain these muscles may be effective for patients with both acute 
and chronic pain. </li> </ul> <br>
<br>
<b>Specific Exercises for Low Back 
Strength</b><br>
<br>
 Perform the following exercises at least three times a 
week:<br>
<br>
<i>Partial Sit-ups. </i> Partial sit-ups or crunches strengthen 
the abdominal muscles.<br>
<br>
 Keep the knees bent and the lower back flat on 
the floor while raising the shoulders up three to six inches.<br>
<br>
 Exhale 
on the way up and inhale on the way down.<br>
<br>
 Perform this exercise 
slowly eight to ten times with the arms across the chest.<br>
<br>
<i>Pelvic 
Tilt.</i> The pelvic tilt alleviates tight or fatigued lower back muscles. 
<ul> 
<li> Lie on the back with the knees bent and feet flat on the floor. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Tighten the buttocks and abdomen so that they tip up slightly. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Press the lower back to the floor, hold for one second and then relax. 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Be sure to breathe evenly. </li> </ul> Over time increase this exercise 
until it is held for five seconds. Then, extend the legs a little more so that 
the feet are further away from the body and try it again.<br>
<br>
<i>
Stretching Lower-Back Muscles.</i> The following are three exercises for 
stretching the lower back: 
<ul> 
<li> Lie on the back with knees bent and legs together. Keeping arms at the 
sides, slowly roll the knees over to one side until totally relaxed. Hold this 
position for about 20 seconds (while breathing evenly) and then repeat on the 
other side.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Lying on the back, hold one knee and pull it gently toward the chest. 
Hold for 20 seconds. Repeat with other knee.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> While supported on hands and knees, lift and straighten right hand and 
left leg at the same time. Hold for three seconds while tightening the 
abdominal muscles. The back should be straight. Alternate with the other arm 
and leg and repeat on each side eight to 20 times. </li> </ul> Note: No one 
with low back pain should perform exercises that require bending over right 
after getting up in the morning. At that time, the discs are more fluid-filled 
and more vulnerable to pressure from this movement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong><br>
 Tips for Daily Movement and Inactivity </strong></p><br>
The 
way a person moves, stands, or sleeps during the day plays a major role in back 
pain: 
<ul> 
<li> Maintaining good posture is very important. This means keeping the ears, 
shoulders, and hips in a straight line with the head up and stomach pulled in. 
It is best not to stand for long periods of time. If it is necessary, walk as 
much as possible and wear shoes without heels, preferably with cushioned soles. 
Using a low stool, alternate resting each foot on it.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Sitting puts the most pressure on the back. Chairs should either have 
straight backs or low-back support. If possible, chairs should swivel to avoid 
twisting at the waist, have arm rests, and adjustable backs. While sitting, the 
knees should be a little higher than the hip, so a low stool or hassock is 
useful to put the feet on. A small pillow or rolled towel behind the lower back 
helps relieve pressure while either sitting or driving.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Riding and particularly driving for long periods in a vehicle increases 
stress. Move the seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending forward. The 
back of the seat should be reclined not more than 30&deg; and, if possible, the 
seat bottom should be tilted slightly up in front. For long rides, one should 
stop and walk around about every hour and avoid lifting or carrying objects 
immediately after the ride.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Be sure to have a firm mattress. If the mattress is too soft, a 1/4-inch 
plywood board can be put between the mattress and box spring. On the other 
hand, some people have experienced morning backache from a mattress that is too 
hard. The back is the best guide. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Tips for Lifting and Bending </strong></p><br>
Anyone who 
engages in heavy lifting should take precautions when lifting and bending: 
<ul> 
<li> If an object is too heavy or awkward, get help. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Spread your feet apart to give a wide base of support. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Stand as close as possible to the object being lifted. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Bend at the knees; tighten stomach muscles and tuck buttocks in so that 
the pelvis is rolled under and the small of the back is flexed slightly. Do not 
arch the back. (Even when not lifting an object, always try to use this posture 
when stooping down).<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Hold objects close to the body to reduce the load on the back. <br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Lift using the leg muscles, not those in the back. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Stand up without bending forward from the waist. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Never twist from the waist while bending or lifting any heavy object. If 
you need to move an object to one side, point your toes in that direction and 
pivot toward it.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> If an object can be moved without lifting, pull it, don't push. </li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 WHAT ARE TREATMENTS FOR SEVERE LOW BACK PAIN (HERNIATED DISC 
OR SPINAL STENOSIS)?</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><br>
 General Approach to Severe Low Back Pain </strong></p><br>
<i>
Early Stage.</i> It is important that any serious medical causes as well as 
cauda equina syndrome and progressive nerve damage be ruled out first. In 
general, early treatments for severe low back pain or for episodes of chronic 
low back pain are similar to those of acute uncomplicated low back pain, 
including avoiding bed rest. If common pain relievers, such as NSAIDs are not 
effective, narcotic agents may be needed for a limited period. Corticosteroid 
injections may be helpful for some patients.<br>
<br>
<i>Approach for Patients 
with Herniated Discs:</i> 
<ul> 
<li> Nonsurgical Procedures. In patients with herniated discs, non surgical 
methods should be used for at least a month before considering surgery. Non 
surgical procedures include spinal manipulation, massage therapy, and physical 
therapy. (Patients should wait at least two to three weeks before using spinal 
manipulation, since early effectiveness and safety are not yet clear.)<br>
<br>

</li> 
<li> Surgery. According to a 2001 review of studies, about 10% of patients 
experience pain after six weeks that is severe enough to warrant consideration 
of discectomy, the standard procedure for herniated disks. For many of these 
patients, surgery may bring significant relief. In one 2001 study, for example, 
70% of patients with moderate to severe sciatica who had had surgery reported 
improvement. And the improvement is superior to that from nonsurgical 
treatments for about four years in most patients. After that, and by ten years, 
however, it is not clear if surgery maintains its advantage over nonsurgical 
approaches. </li> </ul> <i>Approach for Patients with Spinal Stenosis </i> 
<ul> 
<li> Preventing Falls. Falling is a risk for patients with spinal stenosis. 
They should avoid alcohol and sedatives. Leg strengthening exercises (walking, 
cycling) may be helpful, with brief resting if pain occurs.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Nonsurgical Treatments. The use of common pain relievers, such as NSAIDs, 
physical therapy, and steroid or other spinal injections may be helpful for 
some patients.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Surgery. If pain is persistent, patients may require surgery, most often 
a procedure called decompressive laminectomy. Some patients may require spinal 
fusion as well. Studies suggest that surgery reduces back pain in many 
patients, at least for a few years. By four years after surgery, however, 30% 
of patients have severe pain again and 10% have had another operation. It 
should be noted that surgery does not always improve outcome and in some cases 
can even make it worse. Surgery can be an extremely effective approach, 
however, for certain patients with severe back pain that does not respond to 
conservative measures. </li> </ul> <b>Injections</b><br>
<br>
 Injections of 
different substances are sometimes used to treat low back pain caused by nerve 
impingement. The injection is usually an epidural, which is directed into the 
spaces between the outer membrane of the spine and the vertebrae. None of these 
substances cure the problem. 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Corticosteroids.</i> A one-time injection of a corticosteroid 
(commonly called a steroid) is directed as close to the injured location as 
possible. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and this approach may short-cut 
sciatic pain until the body heals itself. This is a temporary, not permanent, 
solution. Studies that measure the benefits of steroids on sciatica or low back 
pain, however, are conflicting. In fact there is some evidence that patients 
can experience a rebound effect within a few months and the pain returns.<br>

<br> </li> 
<li> <i>Hypertonic saline (salt water solution). </i> Epidural injections of 
saline are being investigated for breaking up scar tissue. One 2001 study 
compared targeted injections of saline and steroids directed at the nerve root. 
Although steroid injections had more immediate benefits, both offered 
improvement, and by three months, patients who had saline injections 
experienced less pain than the steroid group.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Local anesthetics. </i> Injections of anesthetics such as xylocaine or 
bupivacaine may also help some patients.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> <i>Botulinum. </i>Injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) in the lower back 
are under investigation. Very small amounts of the bacterial toxin temporarily 
paralyze muscle tissue. Studies in 2000 and 2001 reported that Botox relieved 
pain by at least half in between 60% and 78% of patients compared to between 
12% and 28% who reported the same benefit from placebo. The participants 
experienced no adverse effects. In the 2001 study, however, the benefits of 
Botox injections did subside by six months. </li> </ul> 
<p><strong><br>
 Indications for Surgery </strong></p><br>
The rate of all 
types of back surgery is more than 40% higher in the US than in any other 
country. Surgical treatments for low back pain rose from 190,000 in 1983 to 
335,000 in 1994.<br>
<br>
 The most common reasons for surgery for low back 
pain are sciatica and spinal stenosis. Evidence of a herniated disc and nerve 
compression, however, is not an automatic indication for surgery. It is advised 
only for selected patients. (For example, the best spinal stenosis candidates 
are those with a condition known as block spinal stenosis.) Some experts 
believe that less than 1% of back pain patients need aggressive medical or 
surgical treatments.<br>
<br>
 The primary indication for surgery is the 
following:<br>
<br>
 Pain that has existed for over four months, has not 
responded to conservative treatments, and is so debilitating that it interferes 
with normal functioning.<br>
<br>
 Other, specific indications for surgery 
include the following: 
<ul> 
<li> Progressive weakening in the legs. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Evidence of some physical abnormality of the spine, such as a bone spur. 
<br> <br>
</li> 
<li> Cases of cauda equina syndrome, in which an emergency operation may need 
to be performed to avoid permanent damage. </li> </ul> A patient should be sure 
that the surgeon has had significant experience with any procedure to be 
performed. Research indicates that surgery may have better short-term effects 
than medical treatment (in terms of immediate employability and functioning), 
but that in the long-term they are about equal.<br>
<br>
<b>Discectomy </b><br>

<br> <i>Standard Surgery. </i> Discectomy is the surgical removal of the 
diseased disc, thereby relieving pressure on the spine. In spite of the fact 
that discectomy has been performed for 40 years, few studies have been 
conducted to determine its real effectiveness. A 2000 analysis of previous 
studies reported that it appeared to offer faster relief than medical 
treatment, but long-term superiority is uncertain. Although less invasive 
techniques are being developed and described below, at this time they are no 
more effective than the standard approach. One 2001 study indicated that 
patients who undergo surgery for moderate to severe sciatica have somewhat 
better improvement in symptoms after five years than those who receive 
nonsurgical treatments. The benefits of surgery decrease over time, however.<br>
<br> <i>Endoscopic Discectomy. </i> Less invasive endoscopic variations are 
proving to be effective for some patients. Endoscopy employs a catheter (a thin 
tube) that contains tiny cameras and surgical instruments that are inserted 
through small incisions. Various endoscopic approaches are proving to be useful.
<ul> 
<li> Percutaneous discectomy (PAD) uses a tube with a device at the tip that 
cuts away some of the nucleus pulposus and a vacuum that then sucks this 
gelatinous matter out. This procedure is also being investigated for disks that 
have tears in the annular rings.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Endoscopic laser foraminoplasty (ELF) is a minimally-invasive procedure 
that is proving to be effective and to have fewer complications than other 
spinal surgeries. It employs lasers to locate the likely source of pain and 
remove diseased tissue with minimal complications. </li> </ul> Some experts 
argue that endoscopic procedures are rarely useful and patients often need 
repeat operations. Nevertheless, they pose a lower risk for complications than 
major surgery and some experts urge they be used for selected patients.<br>
<br>
<i>Complications.</i> Scar tissue is a significant problem, since it can cause 
persistent low back pain afterward. Anti-scarring agents or certain devices may 
help reduce surgical scars and thereby postoperative pain.<br>
<br>
<b>
Laminectomy or Laminotomy</b><br>
<br>
 Operations that shave off part of a 
vertebra (laminotomy) or remove all of it (laminectomy) may be used in certain 
cases of spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis to decompress the nerve. It may 
also be used to remove benign tumors on the spine. Although either procedure 
often brings immediate relief from pain, a 1999 statistical study suggested 
that it is inappropriately performed in 60% or more of sciatica cases. There 
are small risks to the operation and it is not always successful. Some 
recurrence of back pain and sciatica occurs in half to two-thirds of 
postoperative patients. One study reported that the operation in children and 
young adults can increase the risk for spinal deformity.<br>
<br>
<b>Spinal 
Fusion</b><br>
<br>
 In cases where abnormal positioning or vertebrae movement 
puts pressure on the nerves, such as spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis, 
surgeons may fuse vertebrae together. (It is not clear, however, whether fusion 
is any more effective for stenosis or spondylolisthesis than procedures for 
reducing disc pressure.) Fusion employs a bone graft or some other device to 
join the vertebrae together. One medical device uses a tiny hollow metal cage, 
which is implanted into the disc space. Bone is removed from the patient and 
packed inside the cage; over time the bone grows through the holes and around 
the device, fusing the vertebrae. In one study, the device was successful in 
72% of patients, reducing pain without any loss of muscle strength or function.
<br> <br>
<b>Postoperative Period: Complications and Outlook </b><br>
<br>
 
Many patients still have back pain after discectomy that delays discharge from 
the hospital. Narcotics are usually needed; adding an injected NSAID may speed 
resolution of pain. It should be noted that one study reported that an injected 
NSAID after fusion procedures may reduce the chances for successful bone 
healing and union. Other complications of spinal surgery can include nerve and 
muscle damage, infection, scarring, and the need for reoperation. Patients now 
often remain in bed only three or four days after disc surgery; studies 
indicate that such patients have the same or even fewer complications than 
those who stay in bed for weeks. It may take four to six weeks for full 
recovery. Gentle exercise may be recommended.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Techniques </b>
<br> <br>
<i>Intradiscal Electrothermal Treatment. </i> A promising procedure 
known as intradiscal electrothermal treatment (IDET) employs a probe that uses 
electricity to heat the injured disc tissue, specifically the annular ring 
nerve fibers. Heat is applied for about 17 minutes. After healing, the disc is 
toughened and desensitized. It requires a substantial post-operative recovery 
period, but may prove to be a less invasive alternative to surgery. Early 
reports are promising, but use is not yet widespread and long-term risks and 
benefits are unknown.<br>
<br>
<i>Nerve Blocks. </i> A number of surgical 
techniques are available for relieving pain by impairing nerves that are 
causing pain due to impingement. In one 2000 study that used electrical 
stimulation to block the nerves, 60% of the patients reported at least 90% 
relief of pain after a year, and 87% reported at least 60% relief.<br>
