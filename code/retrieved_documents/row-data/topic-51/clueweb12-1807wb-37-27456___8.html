<h1>Fever</h1> <br>

<p>FEVER CARE </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The patients infected with Avian Influenza (H5N1) have had symptoms of Cough
,Diarrhea, Fever, Sore Throat, Pneumonia and Acute Repiratory Distress Syndrome 
(ARDS). Not everyone has every symptom. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There is a truism in modern medicine that few would dispute: To find a 
fever, you must take a temperature.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For our purposes today, let&#146;s alter that slightly- to properly treat a 
fever, you must take a temperature. &#147;Mothers Touch&#148; on forehead can 
certainly alert you to an elevated temperature- but is not reliable to prove 
the absence of fever, nor the best way to track your efforts to reduce one.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the important items you should have in your home medicine cabinet is 
a fever thermometer. Although the ear thermometer has become quite popular 
lately, many hospital units have stopped using them, because they tend to be 
unreliable. An oral themometer is fine for most adults. For infants that cant 
use an oral thermometer, a rectal thermometer is the best bet. Good 
thermometers are available inexpensively in Big Box stores and many pharmacies. 
You should have at least one, and a back up in case that one doesnt work.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Mercury thermometers are no longer available because of the health risk 
posed by the metal released by broken glass. Anticipate that the thermometers 
available will be electronic. If you have one on your shelf long term, the 
internal battery may have failed, rendering the unit useless. Take this 
opportunity to check your thermometer. Then add a new one and/or a back up to 
your shopping list. If you are unfamiliar with taking a temperature read the 
directions and practice using it - before it is needed.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A thermometer can spread infection when its used between people. The safest 
way to prevent cross infection through thermometer use is to have one for each 
family member, labelled with their name. If that is unrealistic in your 
circumstance, then know how to effectively clean it between uses and people. 
Read label cleaning directions for the unit you purchase.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Normal body temperatures: <br>
Axillary (armpit)- 97.6 degrees F. 36.44 
degrees C.<br>
Oral- 98.6 degrees F. 37 degrees C. <br>
Rectal- 99.6 degrees F. 
37.55 degrees C.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Body temperatures go up and down throughout the day. It is lowest at 6:00 
A.M. 98.9 degrees F (37.16 degrees C.) maximum oral. It is highest at 4 P.M. 
99.9 degrees F (37.72 degrees C.) maximum oral.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Allowing a fever to continue untreated will not be beneficial in a bird flu 
infection. The internal body temperature of a bird is approximately 108 degrees 
F. The H5N1 strain of influenza survives in this environment. The human body 
would suffer brain damage at this temperature.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Fever in and of itself is rarely dangerous unless it rises extremely high 
(most medical folks would consider over 105 degrees F. or 40.55 degrees C. 
concerning). In fact, it may serve an important purpose- most bacteria and 
viruses that infect humans find it hard to replicate at higher than normal 
human body temperatures. The main danger from fever is rapid dehydration- the 
human body uses twice as much water with every degree of temperature rise. 
Because of this, most physicans now recommend that we balance the risks and 
benefits of fever by only treating and attempting to reduce fevers greater than 
101 degrees F, 38.33 degrees C.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Fever can increase the need for oxygen. Oxygen requirements increase 7 
percent for every 1 degree F increase in body temperature over 98.6 degrees F. 
For example if a fever is 103.6 degrees F (39.77 degrees C) there is a 35 
percent increase in the body&#146;s need for oxygen.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Some children will have &#147;febrile seizures&#148;- Grand mal or 
tonic-clonic type seizures brought on by a rapid rise in body temperature. In 
most cases, although frightening to watch; they are not dangerous in and of 
themselves. Treating a fever reduces the chance that a febrile seizure will 
occur. Most children outgrow them by age 8. If emergency medical services/ 
emergency department care is available, most physicians would consider seizures 
a reason to call for ambulance transport to the hospital for evaluation. Call 
your 911 or Emergency Response phone number.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In the writers experience, some doctors recommend that any child with a 
history of febrile seizues should have their temperatures checked frequently 
whenever they are sick. Any temprature elevations, even if below 101 degrees F. 
(38.33 degrees C.), should be treated to supress the sudden spike that might 
trigger a seizure. If your child has a history of febrile seizures, discuss 
fever care with his/her healthcare provider now, before any illness occurs.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Disclaimer: Nothing in this fever care page should take the place of your 
healthcare providers instructions. It is supplied to help those that cannot 
reach their physican in person or by telephone in times of illness. Although 
based on &#147;Fever Care Guides&#148; usually given patients in Emergency 
Department settings, you should attempt to discuss fever care with your 
physician or healthcare provider before following the information in this page. 
The authors, editors and members or readers of the Flu Wiki are not responsible 
for any negative outcome of persons reading and using the information in this 
page. Internet information should never take the place of your physicians 
instructions.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>FEVER CARE:</strong> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Take the temperature every four hours. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Take off unnecessary clothing. If chills or shivering, use a light blanket. 
Heavier covers prevent the radiation of heat and slow down temperature 
reduction.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Give Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for fever over 101.0 degrees F (38.33 degrees 
C.). For adults and children over 95 lbs., use two tablets (650 mg or 1000 mg 
total dose). For smaller adults and children under 95 lbs, administer according 
to the dosage chart below.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>DO NOT GIVE ASPIRIN TO CHILDREN OR TEENAGERS! Aspirin use during illness 
with colds, flu or chicken pox has been assosciated with the development of 
Reyes Syndrome, a frequently fatal disease.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>DO NOT USE TYLENOL IF THE PATIENT HAS LIVER DISEASE OR ILLNESS UNLESS 
APPROVED BY THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. Ask the provider if ibuprofen is safe 
for the patient to use for fever control.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Give plenty of cold things to drink. Encourage fluids in small amounts 
frequently to a febrile person who is not drinking well on their own. Ice pops 
are often well taken by children who may not drink a bottle or cups otherwise. 
Water, juices (low acid work best, half strength for children) or half strength 
sport drinks work well. Pedialyte (name brand) and similar rehydration liquids 
help replace other nutrients lost in fever. Some sport drinks and 
pedialyte-type replacement fluids come in shelf stable powder form, and at 
least one can makes a good addition to a prep shelf. The human body needs water 
to maintain enough blood and other fluids to function properly.Dehydration 
results when the body loses more liquid than it takes in. This can happen with 
severe diarrhea, especially when there is vomiting too. It can also happen in 
very serious illness, when a person is too sick to take much food or liquid. 
People of any age can become dehydrated, but dehydration develops more quickly 
and is most dangerous in small children.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After four hours, recheck the temperature and readminister acetaminophen if 
needed.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Recheck the temperature any time the patients behavior changes, they have 
chills or &#147;feel hot&#148;. Even after tylenol administration it is unusual 
but possible for the fever to rise higher and need additional treatment may be 
needed.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>FOR FEVER OVER 104 degeees DO THIS ALSO: <br>
Sponge person while sitting 
in a tub of lukewarm (just over your own body temperture, NOT cold water!) 
water for 20 minutes. Rest (dry, in bed) for 20 minutes. Recheck temperature. 
If still over 104 degrees, repeat sponge bath as needed. You can also apply 
cool water soaked towels to the person if they cannot get in a tub. If the 
person starts shivering violently (chills) stop and try again in 20 mins.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In case of vomiting acetaminophen can also be administered by rectal 
suppository. These suppositories are available in the pharmacy section, often 
kept refridgerated behind the counter- ask your pharmasist for a pack. Keep 
them refridgerated before use. Because they come in different strengths check 
the label for dosages.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ibuprofen: <br>
Over the counter ibuprofen can be used for fever reduction. 
It lasts longer than tylenol- closer to six hours than four. For adults without 
a history of stomach ulcer and who can tolerate the medicine, it is another 
choice. Most physicians recommend 600 mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours for fever 
control. Do not take on an empty stomach. Most over the counter tablets are 200 
mg. each, so three tablets equal 600 mg. Take with crackers or milk if 
possible, or use tylenol.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For children over two years of age: <br>
Ibuprofen comes in liquid 
suspension. It can be used according to label directions by weight (Max dose 10 
mg/kg every six hours). Children over 20 kg (44 lbs) can take one adult advil 
(200 mg). Don&#146;t give ibuprofen to children under two years of age without 
your physicians approval.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Using this information when taking other cold/flu medicine: <br>
Many over 
the counter cold and flu compound medicines already contain tylenol, 
acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. If the patient has taken these medicines, check 
the label contents before giving additional medicine like tylenol or ibuprofen 
to treat fever. If they already contain the same medicine you are thinking of 
using, do not give more before the previous dose has warn off. It might result 
in a dangerous overdose of the medicine. Call you doctor or healthcare provider 
before giving other medicine if you are unsure.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This is the reason many healthcare workers choose to use individual 
medicines as needed rather than a compound medicine-it is much easier to treat 
and adjust the symptoms to the patients needs when single medicines are used. 
Instead of storing compound medicines, consider single ones (for example, 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, for fever control and pain relief; guafenisen for 
cough; and pseudoephedrine tablets for decongestant relief) for your prep 
shelf. That way you can treat symptoms as needed, rather than using a 
&#147;shotgun&#148; approach when only one symptom is what you are targeting.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Many over the counter remedies contain an antihistamine. Antihistamines 
have an important role in treating allergy reactions, such as hay fever or 
seasonal allergy problems. Most physicians do not recommend them for treating 
cold and flu, where no allergy component is happening. They can &#147;dry 
up&#148; mucous, making it harder to cough or sneeze out; thus worsening 
breathing. Discuss the use of antihistamines with your healthcare provider to 
make sure the patient recieves the treatment appropriate for them.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Alternating Fever Medicines: </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Some physicians recommend alternating fever control medicines. This 
technique helps prevent sudden fever rise when a single medicine is wearing 
off, but it is not yet time to adminster another dose. This technique can be 
used for children or adults. Determine if your healthcare provider approves 
this technique before using it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To alternate medicines, start with either acetaminophen or tylenol. Check 
the temperature, administer the medine by the correct dose for age/weight. 
Three hours later, check the temperature again. If the fever is still over 
100.0 degrees, administer the second medicine. Check the temperature three 
hours later. If the fever is still over 100.0 degrees, administer the first 
medicine. Continue as needed. This assure that neither medicine is given more 
often than every six hours, but the patient recieves a fever control medicine 
every three hours.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>An example of this in action: At noon, check the temperature. The fever is 
102.0 degrees F (38.88 degrees C.). Administer acetaminophen. At 3 PM, check 
the temperature. If over 100.0 degrees F. (37.77 degrees C.), administer 
ibuprofen. AT 6 PM, check the temperature. If over 100.0 degrees F.(37.77 
degrees C.), administer acetaminophen. Continue as needed. Start over whenever 
the fever rises again. You can start or stop the alternating schedule at any 
time, not only those used in the example. Just make sure that 6 hours passes 
between times that medicine is given again.</p>
