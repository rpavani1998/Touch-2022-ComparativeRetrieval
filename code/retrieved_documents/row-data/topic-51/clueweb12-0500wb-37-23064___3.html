<h1>Flu Information</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p>Below are some tips and facts on how to take care of yourself if you have 
the flu and also to keep others healthy.</p> 
<h2>Seasonal and H1N1 (Swine) Flu</h2> 
<p>Symptoms of flu include fever or chills <strong>and</strong> cough or sore 
throat.&nbsp; In addition, symptoms of flu can include runny nose, body aches, 
headache, tiredness, diarrhea, or vomiting.</p> 
<p>Generally, people with either type of flu can manage recovery at home with 
little or no medical attention.&nbsp; However, certain people are at higher 
risks of serious flu-related complications.</p> 
<h2>Risk Groups</h2> 
<p>These individuals should consult with their health care providers with the 
onset of flu-like symptoms, or following recent close contact with someone who 
has the flu:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>People of any age with certain medical conditions, including: 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma </li> 
<li>Diabetes </li> 
<li>Immune-suppression </li> 
<li>Heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Pregnant women </li> 
<li>Adults 65 years and older </li> 
<li>Children under five years old</li> </ul> 
<h3>Q. How do I recognize a fever or signs of a fever?</h3> 
<p>A fever is a temperature that is equal to or greater than 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit (or 38 degrees Celsius) when taken with a thermometer.&nbsp; Look 
for these possible signs of fever: if someone feels very warm, has a flushed 
appearance, or is sweating or shivering.</p> 
<h3>Q.&nbsp; How do I know if I have seasonal flu or 2009 H1N1?</h3> 
<p>It will be very hard to tell if someone who is sick has seasonal flu or 
2009 H1N1.&nbsp; Public health officials and medical authorities will not be 
recommending laboratory tests.</p> 
<h3>Q.&nbsp; What should I do if I have flu-like symptoms?</h3> 
<p><strong>Stay home!</strong> Don&rsquo;t go to school or work.&nbsp; Get 
plenty of rest, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain, drink 
plenty of liquids.</p> 
<p>Promptly seek medical attention if you have a medical condition that places 
you at higher risk of flu-related complications or develop severe symptoms.</p> 
<h4>Severe symptoms include increased fever, shortness of breath, chest pain 
or pressure, fast breathing, bluish skin color, dizziness or confusion, or if 
you get better but then your symptoms return, even worse.</h4> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Q.&nbsp; What fever-reducing medications can I take?</h3> 
<p>Fever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such 
as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin).&nbsp; These medicines can be taken 
by people who are sick with flu to help bring down their fever and relieve 
their pain.&nbsp; Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone 
younger than 18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious 
illness called Reye&rsquo;s syndrome.</p> 
<h3>Q.&nbsp; What steps can students, faculty, and staff take to stay healthy 
and keep from spreading the flu?</h3> 
<p>Practice good hand hygiene.&nbsp; Wash your hands often with soap and 
water, especially after coughing or sneezing.&nbsp; Alcohol-based (62% alcohol) 
cleaners are also effective.</p> 
<p>Practice respiratory etiquette.&nbsp; The main way flu spreads is from 
person to person in droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, so it&rsquo;s 
important that you cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or 
sneeze.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have a tissue, you should cough or sneeze into 
you elbow or shoulder,<strong>not </strong>your hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Stay home if you are sick</strong>.&nbsp; Stay home or in your 
residence room for at least 24 hours after you no longer have a fever, without 
the use of fever-reducing medication.</p> 
<p>Talk to your health care provider about whether you should be vaccinated
<strong>.&nbsp; Due to a shortage of seasonal flu vaccine, flu shots will NOT 
be available&nbsp;for the Health &amp; Wellness Fair on October 27.&nbsp; We 
are at the top of the list to receive vaccine and we will make them available 
to you as soon as our shipment comes in.</strong> Students, faculty and staff 
should consider getting the H1N1 flu shot when it becomes available.&nbsp; The 
vaccine will be available on campus on a date to be announced.</p>

<h3>Q.&nbsp; What actions should pregnant students, faculty or staff take to 
protect themselves?</h3> 
<p>Pregnant women should follow the same guidance as everyone else related to 
staying home when sick, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and routine 
cleaning.</p> 
<p>Pregnant women are at higher risks of complications from flu and, like all 
people at higher risk, should speak with their health care provider as soon as 
possible if they develop flu-like symptoms.&nbsp; Early treatment with 
antiviral flu medications is recommended for pregnant women who have the flu; 
these medications are most effective when started within the first 48 hours of 
feeling sick.</p> 
<p>Pregnant women should know that they are part of the first priority group 
to receive the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine when it becomes available.&nbsp; Seasonal 
flu vaccine is also recommended for pregnant women and can be given at any time 
during pregnancy.</p>

<h3>Student Profiles</h3> 
<h4>Peter - Accounting</h4> 
<p>Accounting</p>  Read Full Profile 
<p>&quot;I think one of the most crucial aspects of the Daemen curriculum is 
the required internship. I was an accounting intern for both a private health 
care company and a certified public accounting firm. I was able to apply 
lessons learned in the classroom to real business situations. When my 
internships were over,&nbsp;each company&nbsp;offered me a&nbsp;full-time 
position.&quot;</p>
