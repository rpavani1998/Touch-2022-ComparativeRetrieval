<h2>What is the most important information I should know about ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p>This medicine can increase your risk of life-threatening heart or 
circulation problems, including heart attack or stroke. This risk will increase 
the longer you use ibuprofen. Do not use this medicine just before or after 
having heart bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).
</p> 
<p>Seek emergency medical help if you have symptoms of heart or circulation 
problems, such as chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or 
problems with vision or balance.</p> 
<p>This medicine can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach 
or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These 
conditions can be fatal and gastrointestinal effects can occur without warning 
at any time while you are taking ibuprofen. Older adults may have an even 
greater risk of these serious gastrointestinal side effects.</p> 
<p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach 
or intestines. This includes black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up 
blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p> 
<p>Do not take more of this medication than is recommended. An overdose of 
ibuprofen can cause damage to your stomach or intestines. The maximum amount of 
ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum 
doses). Use only the smallest amount of ibuprofen needed to get relief from 
your pain, swelling, or fever.</p> 
<p>Avoid taking ibuprofen if you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or heart 
attack. Ibuprofen can make aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and 
blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the ibuprofen at least 8 
hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form).
</p> 
<p>Do not drink alcohol while taking ibuprofen. Alcohol can increase your risk 
of stomach bleeding caused by ibuprofen.</p> 
<h2>Warning </h2> 
<p>Remember, keep this and all other medicines out of the reach of children, 
never share your medicines with others, and use this medication only for the 
indication prescribed.</p>

<h2>What is ibuprofen?</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ibuprofen is in a group of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs). Ibuprofen works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation 
and pain in the body.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by 
many conditions such as headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual 
cramps, or minor injury.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication 
guide.</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2> 
<p>Taking an NSAID can increase your risk of life-threatening heart or 
circulation problems, including heart attack or stroke. This risk will increase 
the longer you use an NSAID. Do not use this medicine just before or after 
having heart bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).
</p> 
<p>NSAIDs can also increase your risk of serious effects on the stomach or 
intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These 
conditions can be fatal and gastrointestinal effects can occur without warning 
at any time while you are taking an NSAID. Older adults may have an even 
greater risk of these serious gastrointestinal side effects.</p> 
<p>Do not use this medication if you are allergic to ibuprofen, aspirin or 
other NSAIDs.</p> 
<p>Before taking ibuprofen, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, 
or if you have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot;</li> 
<li>heart disease, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure;</li> 
<li>a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding;</li> 
<li>asthma;</li> 
<li>polyps in your nose; or</li> 
<li>liver or kidney disease,</li> 
<li>systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE);</li> 
<li>a bleeding or blood clotting disorder; or</li> 
<li>if you smoke.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you have any of these conditions, you may need a dose adjustment or 
special tests to safely take ibuprofen.</p> 
<p>FDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether ibuprofen is harmful to 
an unborn baby. However, taking ibuprofen during the last 3 months of pregnancy 
may result in birth defects. Do not take ibuprofen during pregnancy unless your 
doctor has told you to.</p> 
<p>It is not known whether ibuprofen passes into breast milk or if it could 
harm a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if 
you are breast-feeding a baby.</p> 
<p>Do not give this medicine to a child without the advice of a doctor.</p> 
<p>Avoid taking ibuprofen if you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or heart 
attack. Ibuprofen can make aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and 
blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the ibuprofen at least 8 
hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form).
</p> 
<p>Do not use any other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medication 
without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Many medicines available over 
the counter contain aspirin or other medicines similar to ibuprofen (such as 
ketoprofen or naproxen). If you take certain products together you may 
accidentally take too much of this type of medication. Read the label of any 
other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, 
ketoprofen, or naproxen.</p> 
<p>Do not drink alcohol while taking ibuprofen. Alcohol can increase the risk 
of stomach bleeding caused by ibuprofen.</p> 
<p>Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning 
beds). Ibuprofen can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may 
result. Use a sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) and wear protective clothing if you 
must be out in the sun.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2> 
<p>Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of 
this medicine. Overdose symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, 
drowsiness, black or bloody stools, coughing up blood, shallow breathing, 
fainting, or coma.</p> 
<p>Since ibuprofen is sometimes taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing 
schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as 
soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed 
dose and wait until your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take extra 
medicine to make up the missed dose.</p>
