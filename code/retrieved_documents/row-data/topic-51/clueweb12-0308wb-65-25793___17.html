<h2>  Headaches in children </h2> <br>

<p><br>
 Headaches in children are common and are usually not serious. Like 
adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraines 
or stress-related (tension) headaches. Children can also have chronic daily 
headaches.</p> 
<p> In some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high 
levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma. That's why it's important to 
pay attention to your child's headache symptoms and to consult a doctor if the 
headache worsens or occurs frequently. Headaches in children can usually be 
treated with over-the-counter pain medications and other lifestyle and home 
measures.</p>

<p> Children get the same types of headaches that adults do, although their 
symptoms may be different. For example, a migraine in an adult almost always 
affects just one side of the head, whereas a child's migraine often affects 
both sides of the head. In addition, headache symptoms in children don't always 
meet the full criteria for a specific type of headache. As a result, it may be 
difficult to pinpoint a specific type of headache in a child, especially in a 
younger child who isn't able to adequately describe his or her symptoms. As a 
child grows into adolescence and adulthood, headache symptoms may evolve, as 
well.</p> 
<p> In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently under 
certain categories.</p> 
<p> <strong>Migraine<br>
</strong>Migraines can cause: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Head pain</li> 
<li>Nausea</li> 
<li>Vomiting</li> 
<li>Abdominal pain</li> 
<li>Extreme sensitivity to light and sound</li> </ul> 
<p> Even infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you 
what's wrong may cry and hold his or her head to indicate severe pain. 
Migraines in children may last an hour or more.</p> 
<p> <strong>Tension-type headache<br>
</strong>Tension-type headaches are 
typically characterized by the following features:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A pressing tightness that occurs on both sides of the head</li> 
<li>Pain that's usually more dull than throbbing</li> 
<li>Pain that's not worsened by physical activity</li> 
<li>Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the 
case with migraine</li> </ul> 
<p> Telltale signs in younger children may include withdrawal from regular 
play and a desire to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 
minutes to several days.</p> 
<p> <strong>Cluster headache<br>
</strong>Cluster headaches are uncommon in 
children under 10 years of age. They usually:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging in frequency from one 
headache every other day up to eight a day</li> 
<li>Involve a sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts from 15 
minutes to three hours</li> 
<li>Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or a heightened 
sense of restlessness or agitation</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Chronic daily headache<br>
</strong>Both migraines and 
tension-type headaches can increase in frequency. If your child has headaches 
more than 15 days a month for more than three months, doctors call this 
&quot;chronic daily headache.&quot; Sometimes, an infection or minor head 
injury precipitates a continuous, persistent headache. This problem can also 
occur when your child takes pain medications &mdash; even the nonprescription 
variety &mdash; too frequently.</p> 
<p> <strong>When to see a doctor<br>
</strong>Most headaches aren't serious, 
but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Occur at least once a week</li> 
<li>Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head</li> 
<li>Feature persistent vomiting or visual changes</li> 
<li>Are accompanied by fever, along with neck pain or stiffness</li> </ul> 
<p>&copy;1998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com. </p> Causes <br>

<p> A number of factors, singly or in combination, can cause your child to 
develop headache. Some of these factors include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Illness and infection.</strong> Common illnesses such as colds, 
flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of 
headache in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or 
encephalitis, also can cause headache, but are usually accompanied by other 
signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness.</li> 
<li><strong>Head trauma.</strong> Accidental bumps and bruises can cause 
headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention 
if your child falls hard on his or her head. Also contact a doctor if your 
child has a steadily worsening head pain after a head injury.</li> 
<li><strong>Emotional factors.</strong> High levels of stress and anxiety 
&mdash; perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents &mdash; 
can play a role in children's headaches. Children with depression may complain 
of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness 
and loneliness.</li> 
<li><strong>Genetic predisposition.</strong> Headaches, particularly 
migraines, tend to run in families.</li> 
<li><strong>Certain foods and beverages.</strong> Nitrates &mdash; a kind of 
food preservative found in such foods as bacon, bologna and hot dogs &mdash; 
have been known to trigger headaches, as can the food additive monosodium 
glutamate (MSG). Also, too much caffeine &mdash; contained in foods such as 
soda, chocolate, coffee and tea &mdash; can cause headaches.</li> 
<li><strong>Problems in the brain.</strong> Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess, 
or bleeding in the brain, may create pressure on areas of the brain, causing a 
chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, headache is 
accompanied by other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness, lack of 
coordination and other neurological problems.</li> </ul>

<p> Any child can develop headaches, but they're more common in: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Girls after they reach puberty</li> 
<li>Children who have a family history of headaches or migraines</li> </ul>

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com. </p> Preparing for your 
appointment <br>

<p> For headaches in children, you typically make an appointment with your 
family doctor or your child's pediatrician. Depending on the frequency and 
severity of your child's symptoms, you may be referred to a doctor who 
specializes in conditions of the brain and nervous system (neurologist).</p> 
<p> Because appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of ground to 
cover, it can help to be well prepared. Here are some tips to help you get 
ready for your child's appointment and what to expect from the doctor.</p> 
<p> <strong>What you can do</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Write down your child's signs and symptoms, when they occurred and 
how long they lasted.</strong> It may help to keep a headache diary &mdash; 
listing each headache, when it happens, how long it lasts, and what might have 
caused it.</li> 
<li><strong>Make a list of all medications,</strong> as well as any vitamins 
or supplements, that your child is taking.</li> 
<li><strong>Write down questions to ask your doctor.</strong> Don't be afraid 
to ask questions or to speak up when you don't understand something your doctor 
says.</li> </ul> 
<p> List your questions from most important to least important in case your 
time with your doctor runs out. For headaches in children, some basic questions 
to ask your doctor include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>What is likely causing the symptoms?</li> 
<li>Are tests needed to confirm the diagnosis?</li> 
<li>What is the best course of action?</li> 
<li>Does my child need prescription medication, or would an over-the-counter 
medication work?</li> 
<li>What kind of follow-up, if any, is needed?</li> 
<li>What can we do at home to help lessen the pain?</li> 
<li>What can we do at home to prevent headaches?</li> </ul> 
<p> In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, 
don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment at any time that you 
don't understand something.</p> 
<p> <strong>What to expect from your doctor<br>
</strong>Your doctor is likely 
to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time 
to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When did the symptoms first start?</li> 
<li>How often does your child experience these symptoms?</li> 
<li>How long does the headache usually last?</li> 
<li>Where does the pain occur?</li> 
<li>Have the symptoms been continuous or intermittent?</li> 
<li>Does your child have other symptoms, such as nausea or dizziness?</li> 
<li>What, if anything, makes it better?</li> 
<li>What, if anything, makes it worse?</li> 
<li>Have the symptoms changed over time?</li> 
<li>What treatments have you tried?</li> 
<li>What medications does your child take?</li> 
<li>Do other family members experience headaches?</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>What you can do in the meantime<br>
</strong>While waiting for 
your child's appointment, place a cool, wet cloth on your child's forehead and 
encourage him or her to take a nap in a dark, quiet room.</p> 
<p> Also, consider giving your child over-the-counter pain medications such as 
acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) to ease 
symptoms. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though 
aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and 
teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take 
aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but 
potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor 
if you have concerns.</p>

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com. </p> Tests and diagnosis
<br> 
<p> To learn about the nature of your child's headache, your doctor will 
likely recommend the following steps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Headache history.</strong> Your doctor asks you and your child to 
describe the headaches in detail, to see if there's a pattern or a common 
trigger. Your doctor may also ask you to keep a headache diary for a time, so 
you can record more details about your child's headaches, such as frequency, 
severity of pain and possible triggers.</li> 
<li><strong>Physical exam.</strong> The doctor also performs a physical exam, 
including measuring your child's height, weight, head circumference, blood 
pressure and pulse, and examining your child's eyes, neck, head, shoulders and 
spine.</li> 
<li><strong>Neurological exam.</strong> Your doctor checks for any problems 
with movement, coordination or sensation.</li> </ul> 
<p> If your child is otherwise healthy and headache is the only symptom, no 
further testing usually is needed. In a few cases, however, imaging scans and 
other evaluations are needed to pinpoint a diagnosis or to rule out other 
medical conditions that could be causing the headaches. These tests may include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Computerized tomography (CT).</strong> This imaging procedure uses 
a series of computer-directed X-rays that provide a cross-sectional view of 
your child's brain. This helps doctors diagnose tumors, infections and other 
possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.</li> 
<li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong> MRIs use radio waves 
and a powerful magnet to produce very detailed views of the brain. MRI scans 
help doctors diagnose tumors, strokes, aneurysms, neurological diseases and 
other brain abnormalities. An MRI can also be used to examine the blood vessels 
that supply the brain.</li> 
<li><strong>Spinal tap (lumbar puncture).</strong> If your doctor suspects 
that an underlying condition, such as bacterial or viral meningitis, is the 
cause of your child's headaches, he or she may recommend a spinal tap (lumbar 
puncture). In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted between two vertebrae 
in the lower back to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for 
laboratory analysis.</li> </ul> 
<p>&copy;1998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). 
Terms of use. <br>
Read this article on Mayoclinic.com. </p> Treatments and 
drugs <br>

<p> Most of the time, you can treat your child's headache at home with rest, 
decreased noise, plenty of fluids, balanced meals and over-the-counter (OTC) 
pain relievers. If your child is older and has frequent headaches, learning to 
relax and manage stress through different forms of therapy may help, as well.
</p> 
<p> <strong>Medications</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>OTC pain relievers.</strong> Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or 
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) can typically relieve headaches for your 
child. Some studies show that ibuprofen may work faster than acetaminophen in 
relieving migraine pain. OTC medications such as these are inexpensive and 
readily available and don't require a prescription from your doctor. They 
should be taken at the first sign of headache.</p> 
<p> Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin 
is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers 
recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This 
is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially 
life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have 
concerns.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Prescription medications.</strong> Sumatriptan (Imitrex), a 
prescription drug, is effective and can be safely used in children over the age 
of 12.</p> 
<p> If your child experiences nausea and vomiting with migraines, your doctor 
may prescribe an anti-nausea drug, such as promethazine. The medication 
strategy differs from child to child, however. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if 
you have questions.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Caution:</strong> Overuse of medications is itself a contributing 
factor to headache (rebound headache). Over time, painkillers and other 
medications may lose their effectiveness. In addition, all medications have 
side effects. If your child takes medications regularly, including products you 
buy over-the-counter, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.</p> 
<p> <strong>Therapies<br>
</strong>While stress doesn't appear to cause 
headaches, it can act as a trigger for headache or make headache worse. 
Depression and other mental health disorders also can play a role. For these 
situations, your doctor may recommend one or more behavior therapies, such as:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Relaxation training.</strong> Relaxation techniques include deep 
breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, which is 
accomplished by tensing one muscle at a time, and then completely releasing the 
tension, until every muscle in the body is relaxed. An older child can learn 
relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes.</li> 
<li><strong>Biofeedback training.</strong> Biofeedback teaches your child to 
control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback 
session, your child is connected to devices that monitor and give feedback on 
body functions, such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. Your 
child then learns how to reduce muscle tension and slow his or her heart rate 
and breathing. The goal of biofeedback is to help your child enter a relaxed 
state to better cope with pain.</li> 
<li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy.</strong> This therapy can help your 
child learn to manage stress and reduce the frequency and severity of 
headaches. During this type of talk therapy, a counselor helps your child learn 
ways to view and cope with life events more positively.</li> </ul>

remedies <br>

<p> Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, 
others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), are usually effective in 
reducing headache pain. Before giving your child pain medication, keep these 
points in mind:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Read labels carefully and use only the dosages recommended for your child.
</li> 
<li>Don't give doses more frequently than recommended.</li> 
<li>Don't give your child OTC pain medication more than two or three days a 
week. Daily use can trigger a rebound headache, a type of headache caused by 
overuse of pain medications.</li> 
<li>Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin 
is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers 
recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This 
is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially 
life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have 
concerns.</li> </ul> 
<p> In addition to OTC pain medications, the following measures can help ease 
your child's headache:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Rest and relax.</strong> Encourage your child to rest in a dark, 
quiet room. Sleeping often resolves headaches in children.</li> 
<li><strong>Use a cool, wet compress.</strong> While your child rests, place a 
cool, wet cloth on his or her forehead.</li> 
<li><strong>Offer a healthy snack.</strong> If your child hasn't eaten in a 
while, offer a piece of fruit, whole-wheat crackers or low-fat cheese. Going 
without meals can sometimes make headaches worse.</li> </ul> 
<p>&copy;1998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Read this article on Mayoclinic.com. </p> Prevention <br>

<p> The following may help you prevent headaches or reduce the severity of 
headaches in children:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Practice healthy behaviors.</strong> Behaviors that promote 
general good health also may help prevent headaches for your child. These 
lifestyle measures include getting plenty of sleep, staying physically active, 
eating healthy meals and snacks, and avoiding caffeine.</li> 
<li><strong>Reduce stress.</strong> Stress and busy schedules may increase the 
frequency of headaches. Be alert for things that may cause stress in your 
child's life, such as difficulty doing schoolwork or strained relationships 
with peers. If your child's headaches are linked to anxiety or depression, 
consider talking to a counselor.</li> 
<li><strong>Keep a headache diary.</strong> A diary can help you determine 
what causes your child's headaches. Note when the headaches start, how long 
they last and what, if anything, provides relief. Record your child's response 
to taking any headache medication. Over time, the items you note in the 
headache diary should help you understand your child's symptoms so that you can 
take specific preventive measures.</li> 
<li><strong>Avoid headache triggers.</strong> Avoid any food or drinks, such 
as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches. Your headache 
diary can help you determine what prompts your child's headaches, so you know 
what to avoid.</li> 
<li><strong>Follow your doctor's plan.</strong> Your doctor may recommend 
preventive medication if the headaches are severe, occur daily and interfere 
with your child's normal lifestyle. Certain medications taken at regular 
intervals &mdash; such as certain antidepressants or anti-seizure medications 
&mdash; may reduce the frequency and severity of headaches.</li> </ul>
