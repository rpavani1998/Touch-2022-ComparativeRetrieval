<p>Ibuprofen is one of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used 
to treat certain types of arthritis. Ibuprofen was approved by the FDA as a 
prescription medication in 1974. A nonprescription formulation of ibuprofen was 
approved in 1984.</p> 
<h3>What is the availability and recommended dosing of ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen is currently available in lower strengths as an over-the-counter 
drug -- and at higher strengths by prescription only. There are brand name and 
generic versions of ibuprofen. The drug comes as an oral capsule, oral 
suspension, chewable oral tablet, and oral tablet.</p> 
<p>For arthritis, adults and teenagers are prescribed between 1,200 to 3,200 
mg a day, in divided doses that are taken three or four times a day. For 
children 6 months to 12 years of age, the dose is based on body weight and 
should be determined by your doctor. For infants younger than 6 months of age, 
your doctor will determine if the use of ibuprofen is appropriate.</p> 
<p>As a prescription drug, the maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 
mg per single dose or 3,200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). Over-the-counter 
limits are less, with a maximum daily dose of 1200 mg. The smallest amount of 
ibuprofen needed to get relief from pain, swelling, or fever is recommended. 
Your doctor will recommend an appropriate dose for you and can adjust your 
dosage based on your response.</p> 
<h3>When is ibuprofen prescribed?</h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation associated 
with headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, or minor 
injury.</p> 
<h3>Are there any special instructions regarding how to take ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Many doctors instruct patients to take ibuprofen with food or milk to 
reduce stomach irritation. Other resources suggest taking it with a full glass 
of water. If stomach upset occurs, consult your doctor. He may recommend that 
you take an antacid.</p> 
<h3>Are there patients who should not take ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Patients who had episodes of asthma, rhinitis, or nasal polyps after taking 
aspirin or other NSAIDs should not take ibuprofen. Aspirin-sensitive patients 
should not take ibuprofen.</p> 
<p>Be sure your doctor knows about any previous drug reactions. Patients who 
have had ulcers, stomach bleeding, severe kidney problems, or severe liver 
problems may not be candidates for treatment with ibuprofen. The drug should 
also not be taken before or after coronary bypass surgery.</p> 
<h3>What common side effects can occur with ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Diarrhea, constipation, gas, mouth sores, headache, dizziness, thirst, 
lightheadedness, drowsiness, tingling in arms and legs, cold symptoms, ringing 
in the ears, hearing problems, and trouble falling or staying asleep are all 
possible side effects associated with ibuprofen.</p> 
<h3>What special warnings and precautions are associated with ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Problems with stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding can occur with any NSAID, 
including ibuprofen. Typically, these problems are tied to long-term use of the 
drug but not always -- short-term use of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs can be 
problematic for some patients. Stomach ulcers and bleeding can occur without 
warning. Some people do get signs and warnings by experiencing burning stomach 
pain, black stools, or vomiting. Call your doctor if you are experiencing these 
symptoms.</p> 
<p>Liver damage can occur in people taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Warning 
signs include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, appetite loss, itching, yellowing of 
the skin or eyes, and dark urine.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen can cause fluid retention and swelling in the body. NSAIDs like 
ibuprofen have also been linked to increased blood pressure.</p> 
<p>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, are associated with an increased risk of 
adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attack, stroke, and new onset or 
worsening of pre-existinghypertension (high blood pressure). The cardiovascular 
risk may be increased with duration of use of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs or 
pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease.</p> 
<h3>Are there drug interactions associated with ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>Ibuprofen can have serious adverse reactions with certain drugs. Drugs 
which can cause interactions include:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aspirin</li> 
<li>ACE inhibitors</li> 
<li>Blood-thinning medications</li> 
<li>Furosemide</li> 
<li>Steroids</li> 
<li>Lithium</li> 
<li>Methotrexate</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Are there special instructions for pregnant or nursing women?</h3> 
<p>If you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your 
pregnancy, or you plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding, consult your 
doctor before using ibuprofen.</p> 
<h3>What are the signs of overdose with ibuprofen?</h3> 
<p>As with any medication, there can be severe consequences of taking 
excessive doses of ibuprofen. Overdose of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs can cause 
nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding. Other serious potential 
consequences of overdose include kidney and liver damage, meningitis, 
circulatory collapse and even death. Be sure to take ibuprofen only as directed.
