<p> Introduction: The Universal Disorder</p> 
<p>You know it at once. It may be the fiery sensation of a burn moments after 
your finger touches the stove. Or it's a dull ache above your brow after a day 
of stress and tension. Or you may recognize it as a sharp pierce in your back 
after you lift something heavy.</p> 
<p>It is pain. In its most benign form, it warns us that something isn't quite 
right, that we should take medicine or see a doctor. At its worst, however, 
pain robs us of our productivity, our well-being, and, for many of us suffering 
from extended illness, our very lives. Pain is a complex perception that 
differs enormously among individual patients, even those who appear to have 
identical injuries or illnesses.</p> 
<p>In 1931, the French medical missionary Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote, 
&quot;Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death itself.&quot; 
Today, pain has become the universal disorder, a serious and costly public 
health issue, and a challenge for family, friends, and health care providers 
who must give support to the individual suffering from the physical as well as 
the emotional consequences of pain. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>A Brief History of Pain</p> 
<p>Ancient civilizations recorded on stone tablets accounts of pain and the 
treatments used: pressure, heat, water, and sun. Early humans related pain to 
evil, magic, and demons. Relief of pain was the responsibility of sorcerers, 
shamans, priests, and priestesses, who used herbs, rites, and ceremonies as 
their treatments.</p> 
<p>The Greeks and Romans were the first to advance a theory of sensation, the 
idea that the brain and nervous system have a role in producing the perception 
of pain. But it was not until the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance-the 
1400s and 1500s-that evidence began to accumulate in support of these theories. 
Leonardo da Vinci and his contemporaries came to believe that the brain was the 
central organ responsible for sensation. Da Vinci also developed the idea that 
the spinal cord transmits sensations to the brain.</p> 
<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, the study of the body-and the 
senses-continued to be a source of wonder for the world's philosophers. In 
1664, the French philosopher Ren&eacute; Descartes described what to this day 
is still called a &quot;pain pathway.&quot; Descartes illustrated how particles 
of fire, in contact with the foot, travel to the brain and he compared pain 
sensation to the ringing of a bell.</p> 
<p>In the 19th century, pain came to dwell under a new domain-science-paving 
the way for advances in pain therapy. Physician-scientists discovered that 
opium, morphine, codeine, and cocaine could be used to treat pain. These drugs 
led to the development of aspirin, to this day the most commonly used pain 
reliever. Before long, anesthesia-both general and regional-was refined and 
applied during surgery.</p> 
<p>&quot;It has no future but itself,&quot; wrote the 19th century American 
poet Emily Dickinson, speaking about pain. As the 21st century unfolds, 
however, advances in pain research are creating a less grim future than that 
portrayed in Dickinson&#146;s verse, a future that includes a better 
understanding of pain, along with greatly improved treatments to keep it in 
check.</p> 
<p>The Two Faces of Pain: Acute and Chronic </p> 
<p>What is pain? The International Association for the Study of Pain defines 
it as:<i>An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual 
or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.</i></p> 
<p>It is useful to distinguish between two basic types of pain, acute and 
chronic, and they differ greatly.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Acute pain</strong>, for the most part, results from disease, 
inflammation, or injury to tissues. This type of pain generally comes on 
suddenly, for example, after trauma or surgery, and may be accompanied by 
anxiety or emotional distress. The cause of acute pain can usually be diagnosed 
and treated, and the pain is self-limiting, that is, it is confined to a given 
period of time and severity. In some rare instances, it can become chronic.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><strong>Chronic pain</strong> is widely believed to represent disease 
itself. It can be made much worse by environmental and psychological factors. 
Chronic pain persists over a longer period of time than acute pain and is 
resistant to most medical treatments. It can&#151;and often does&#151;cause 
severe problems for patients.</li> </ul> 
<p>The A to Z of Pain</p> 
<p>Hundreds of pain syndromes or disorders make up the spectrum of pain. There 
are the most benign, fleeting sensations of pain, such as a pin prick. There is 
the pain of childbirth, the pain of a heart attack, and the pain that sometimes 
follows amputation of a limb. There is also pain accompanying cancer and the 
pain that follows severe trauma, such as that associated with head and spinal 
cord injuries. A sampling of common pain syndromes follows, listed 
alphabetically.</p> 
<p><b>Arachnoiditis</b> is a condition in which one of the three membranes 
covering the brain and spinal cord, called the arachnoid membrane, becomes 
inflamed. A number of causes, including infection or trauma, can result in 
inflammation of this membrane. Arachnoiditis can produce disabling, 
progressive, and even permanent pain.</p> 
<p><b>Arthritis</b>. Millions of Americans suffer from arthritic conditions 
such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and gout. 
These disorders are characterized by joint pain in the extremities. Many other 
inflammatory diseases affect the body's soft tissues, including tendonitis and 
bursitis.</p> 
<p><b>Back pain</b> has become the high price paid by our modern lifestyle and 
is a startlingly common cause of disability for many Americans, including both 
active and inactive people. Back pain that spreads to the leg is called 
sciatica and is a very common condition (see below). Another common type of 
back pain is associated with the discs of the spine, the soft, spongy padding 
between the vertebrae (bones) that form the spine. Discs protect the spine by 
absorbing shock, but they tend to degenerate over time and may sometimes 
rupture.<b>Spondylolisthesis</b> is a back condition that occurs when one 
vertebra extends over another, causing pressure on nerves and therefore pain. 
Also, damage to nerve roots is a serious condition, called<b>radiculopathy</b>, 
that can be extremely painful. Treatment for a damaged disc includes drugs such 
as painkillers, muscle relaxants, and steroids; exercise or rest, depending on 
the patient's condition; adequate support, such as a brace or better mattress 
and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the 
damaged portion of the disc and return it to its previous condition, especially 
when it is pressing a nerve root. Surgical procedures include discectomy, 
laminectomy, or spinal fusion.</p> 
<p><b>Burn pain</b> can be profound and poses an extreme challenge to the 
medical community. First-degree burns are the least severe; with third-degree 
burns, the skin is lost. Depending on the injury, pain accompanying burns can 
be excruciating, and even after the wound has healed patients may have chronic 
pain at the burn site.</p> 
<p><b>Central pain syndrome</b>-see &quot;Trauma&quot; below. </p> 
<p><b>Cancer pain</b> can accompany the growth of a tumor, the treatment of 
cancer, or chronic problems related to cancer's permanent effects on the body. 
Fortunately, most cancer pain can be treated to help minimize discomfort and 
stress to the patient.</p> 
<p><b>Headaches</b> affect millions of Americans. The three most common types 
of chronic headache are migraines, cluster headaches, and tension headaches. 
Each comes with its own telltale brand of pain.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Migraines</b> are characterized by throbbing pain and sometimes by 
other symptoms, such as nausea and visual disturbances. Migraines are more 
frequent in women than men. Stress can trigger a migraine headache, and 
migraines can also put the sufferer at risk for stroke.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>Cluster</b> headaches are characterized by excruciating, piercing pain 
on one side of the head; they occur more frequently in men than women.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>Tension headaches</b> are often described as a tight band around the 
head.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Head and facial pain</b> can be agonizing, whether it results from 
dental problems or from disorders such as cranial neuralgia, in which one of 
the nerves in the face, head, or neck is inflamed. Another condition,<b>
trigeminal neuralgia</b> (also called tic douloureux), affects the largest of 
the cranial nerves and is characterized by a stabbing, shooting pain.</p> 
<p><b>Muscle pain</b> can range from an aching muscle, spasm, or strain, to 
the severe spasticity that accompanies paralysis. Another disabling syndrome is
<b>fibromyalgia</b>, a disorder characterized by fatigue, stiffness, joint 
tenderness, and widespread muscle pain.<b>Polymyositis</b>, <b>dermatomyositis
</b>, and <b>inclusion body myositis</b> are painful disorders characterized by 
muscle inflammation. They may be caused by infection or autoimmune dysfunction 
and are sometimes associated with connective tissue disorders, such as lupus 
and rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<p><b>Myofascial pain syndromes</b> affect sensitive areas known as trigger 
points, located within the body's muscles. Myofascial pain syndromes are 
sometimes misdiagnosed and can be debilitating.<b>Fibromyalgia</b> is a type of 
myofascial pain syndrome.</p> 
<p><b>Neuropathic pain</b> is a type of pain that can result from injury to 
nerves, either in the peripheral or central nervous system. Neuropathic pain 
can occur in any part of the body and is frequently described as a hot, burning 
sensation, which can be devastating to the affected individual. It can result 
from diseases that affect nerves (such as diabetes) or from trauma, or, because 
chemotherapy drugs can affect nerves, it can be a consequence of cancer 
treatment. Among the many neuropathic pain conditions are<b>diabetic neuropathy
</b> (which results from nerve damage secondary to vascular problems that occur 
with diabetes);<b>reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome</b>, which can follow 
injury;<b>phantom limb</b> and <b>post-amputation pain</b>, which can result 
from the surgical removal of a limb;<b>postherpetic neuralgia</b>, which can 
occur after an outbreak of shingles; and<b>central pain syndrome</b>, which can 
result from trauma to the brain or spinal cord.</p> 
<p><b>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome</b>, or RSDS, is accompanied by 
burning pain and hypersensitivity to temperature. Often triggered by trauma or 
nerve damage, RSDS causes the skin of the affected area to become 
characteristically shiny. In recent years, RSDS has come to be called<b>complex 
regional pain syndrome</b> (CRPS); in the past it was often called <b>causalgia
</b>.</p> 
<p>Repetitive stress injuries are muscular conditions that result from 
repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or other daily 
activities. They include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>writer's cramp, which affects musicians and writers and others, </li> 
<li>compression or entrapment neuropathies, including carpal tunnel syndrome, 
caused by chronic overextension of the wrist and</li> 
<li>tendonitis or tenosynovitis, affecting one or more tendons. </li> </ul> 
<p><b>Sciatica</b> is a painful condition caused by pressure on the sciatic 
nerve, the main nerve that branches off the spinal cord and continues down into 
the thighs, legs, ankles, and feet. Sciatica is characterized by pain in the 
buttocks and can be caused by a number of factors. Exertion, obesity, and poor 
posture can all cause pressure on the sciatic nerve. One common cause of 
sciatica is a herniated disc.</p> 
<p><b>Shingles and other painful disorders</b> affect the skin. Pain is a 
common symptom of many skin disorders, even the most common rashes. One of the 
most vexing neurological disorders is shingles or herpes zoster, an infection 
that often causes agonizing pain resistant to treatment. Prompt treatment with 
antiviral agents is important to arrest the infection, which if prolonged can 
result in an associated condition known as<b>postherpetic neuralgia</b>. Other 
painful disorders affecting the skin include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>vasculitis</b>, or inflammation of blood vessels; </li> 
<li>other infections, including <b>herpes simplex</b>; </li> 
<li>skin <b>tumors</b> and <b>cysts</b>, and </li> 
<li>tumors associated with <b>neurofibromatosis</b>, a neurogenetic disorder. 
</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Sports injuries</b> are common. Sprains, strains, bruises, dislocations, 
and fractures are all well-known words in the language of sports. Pain is 
another. In extreme cases, sports injuries can take the form of costly and 
painful spinal cord and head injuries, which cause severe suffering and 
disability.</p> 
<p><b>Spinal stenosis</b> refers to a narrowing of the canal surrounding the 
spinal cord. The condition occurs naturally with aging. Spinal stenosis causes 
weakness in the legs and leg pain usually felt while the person is standing up 
and often relieved by sitting down.</p> 
<p><b>Surgical pain</b> may require regional or general anesthesia during the 
procedure and medications to control discomfort following the operation. 
Control of pain associated with surgery includes presurgical preparation and 
careful monitoring of the patient during and after the procedure.</p> 
<p><b>Temporomandibular disorders</b> are conditions in which the 
temporomandibular joint (the jaw) is damaged and/or the muscles used for 
chewing and talking become stressed, causing pain. The condition may be the 
result of a number of factors, such as an injury to the jaw or joint 
misalignment, and may give rise to a variety of symptoms, most commonly pain in 
the jaw, face, and/or neck muscles. Physicians reach a diagnosis by listening 
to the patient's description of the symptoms and by performing a simple 
examination of the facial muscles and the temporomandibular joint.</p> 
<p><b>Trauma</b> can occur after injuries in the home, at the workplace, 
during sports activities, or on the road. Any of these injuries can result in 
severe disability and pain. Some patients who have had an injury to the spinal 
cord experience intense pain ranging from tingling to burning and, commonly, 
both. Such patients are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures and touch. For 
these individuals, a touch can be perceived as intense burning, indicating 
abnormal signals relayed to and from the brain. This condition is called<b>
central pain syndrome</b> or, if the damage is in the thalamus (the brain's 
center for processing bodily sensations),<b>thalamic pain syndrome</b>. It 
affects as many as 100,000 Americans with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's 
disease, amputated limbs, spinal cord injuries, and stroke. Their pain is 
severe and is extremely difficult to treat effectively. A variety of 
medications, including analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and 
electrical stimulation, are options available to central pain patients.</p> 
<p><b>Vascular disease or injury</b>-such as vasculitis or inflammation of 
blood vessels, coronary artery disease, and circulatory problems-all have the 
potential to cause pain. Vascular pain affects millions of Americans and occurs 
when communication between blood vessels and nerves is interrupted. Ruptures, 
spasms, constriction, or obstruction of blood vessels, as well as a condition 
called ischemia in which blood supply to organs, tissues, or limbs is cut off, 
can also result in pain.</p> 
<p>Return to top </p> 
<p> How is Pain Diagnosed?</p> 
<p>There is no way to tell how much pain a person has. No test can measure the 
intensity of pain, no imaging device can show pain, and no instrument can 
locate pain precisely. Sometimes, as in the case of headaches, physicians find 
that the best aid to diagnosis is the patient's own description of the type, 
duration, and location of pain. Defining pain as sharp or dull, constant or 
intermittent, burning or aching may give the best clues to the cause of pain. 
These descriptions are part of what is called the pain history, taken by the 
physician during the preliminary examination of a patient with pain.</p> 
<p>Physicians, however, do have a number of technologies they use to find the 
cause of pain. Primarily these include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Electrodiagnostic procedures</b> include <b>electromyography (EMG)</b>, 
<b>nerve conduction studies</b>, and <b>evoked potential (EP) studies</b>. 
Information from<b>EMG</b> can help physicians tell precisely which muscles or 
nerves are affected by weakness or pain. Thin needles are inserted in muscles 
and a physician can see or listen to electrical signals displayed on an EMG 
machine. With<b>nerve conduction studies</b> the doctor uses two sets of 
electrodes (similar to those used during an electrocardiogram) that are placed 
on the skin over the muscles. The first set gives the patient a mild shock that 
stimulates the nerve that runs to that muscle. The second set of electrodes is 
used to make a recording of the nerve's electrical signals, and from this 
information the doctor can determine if there is nerve damage.<b>EP tests</b> 
also involve two sets of electrodes-one set for stimulating a nerve (these 
electrodes are attached to a limb) and another set on the scalp for recording 
the speed of nerve signal transmission to the brain.
<p></p> </li> 
<li>Imaging, especially <b>magnetic resonance imaging<b> or <b>MRI</b>, 
provides physicians with pictures of the body's structures and tissues. MRI 
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to differentiate between healthy and 
diseased tissue.
<p></p></b></b> </li> 
<li>A <b>neurological examination</b> in which the physician tests movement, 
reflexes, sensation, balance, and coordination.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>X-rays</b> produce pictures of the body's structures, such as bones and 
joints.</li> </ul> 
<p>Return to top </p> 
<p> How is Pain Treated?</p> 
<p>The goal of pain management is to improve function, enabling individuals to 
work, attend school, or participate in other day-to-day activities. Patients 
and their physicians have a number of options for the treatment of pain; some 
are more effective than others. Sometimes, relaxation and the use of imagery as 
a distraction provide relief. These methods can be powerful and effective, 
according to those who advocate their use. Whatever the treatment regime, it is 
important to remember that pain is<b>treatable</b>. The following treatments 
are among the most common.</p> 
<p><b>Acetaminophen</b> is the basic ingredient found in Tylenol&reg; and its 
many generic equivalents. It is sold over the counter, in a 
prescription-strength preparation, and in combination with codeine (also by 
prescription).</p> 
<p><b>Acupuncture</b> dates back 2,500 years and involves the application of 
needles to precise points on the body. It is part of a general category of 
healing called traditional Chinese or Oriental medicine. Acupuncture remains 
controversial but is quite popular and may one day prove to be useful for a 
variety of conditions as it continues to be explored by practitioners, 
patients, and investigators.</p> 
<p><b>Analgesic</b> refers to the class of drugs that includes most 
painkillers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The word analgesic 
is derived from ancient Greek and means to reduce or stop pain. Nonprescription 
or over-the-counter pain relievers are generally used for mild to moderate 
pain. Prescription pain relievers, sold through a pharmacy under the direction 
of a physician, are used for more moderate to severe pain.</p> 
<p><b>Anticonvulsants</b> are used for the treatment of seizure disorders but 
are also sometimes prescribed for the treatment of pain. Carbamazepine in 
particular is used to treat a number of painful conditions, including 
trigeminal neuralgia. Another antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, is being studied 
for its pain-relieving properties, especially as a treatment for neuropathic 
pain.</p> 
<p><b>Antidepressants</b> are sometimes used for the treatment of pain and, 
along with neuroleptics and lithium, belong to a category of drugs called 
psychotropic drugs. In addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also 
act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers. Physicians 
usually try to treat the condition with analgesics before prescribing these 
drugs.</p> 
<p><b>Antimigraine</b> drugs include the triptans- sumatriptan (Imitrex&reg;), 
naratriptan (Amerge&reg;), and zolmitriptan (Zomig&reg;)-and are used 
specifically for migraine headaches. They can have serious side effects in some 
people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only 
under a doctor's care.</p> 
<p><b>Aspirin</b> may be the most widely used pain-relief agent and has been 
sold over the counter since 1905 as a treatment for fever, headache, and muscle 
soreness.</p> <b>Biofeedback</b> is used for the treatment of many common pain 
problems, most notably headache and back pain. Using a special electronic 
machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain 
control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, 
and skin temperature. The individual can then learn to effect a change in his 
or her responses to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. 
Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, 
generally without side effects. Similarly, the use of relaxation techniques in 
the treatment of pain can increase the patient's feeling of well-being.
<p><b>Capsaicin</b> is a chemical found in chili peppers that is also a 
primary ingredient in pain-relieving creams.</p> 
<p><b>Chemonucleolysis</b> is a treatment in which an enzyme, chymopapain, is 
injected directly into a herniated lumbar disc in an effort to dissolve 
material around the disc, thus reducing pressure and pain. The procedure's use 
is extremely limited, in part because some patients may have a life-threatening 
allergic reaction to chymopapain.</p> 
<p><b>Chiropractic</b> refers to hand manipulation of the spine, usually for 
relief of back pain, and is a treatment option that continues to grow in 
popularity among many people who simply seek relief from back disorders. It has 
never been without controversy, however. Chiropractic's usefulness as a 
treatment for back pain is, for the most part, restricted to a select group of 
individuals with uncomplicated acute low back pain who may derive relief from 
the massage component of the therapy.</p> 
<p><b>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</b> involves a wide variety of coping 
skills and relaxation methods to help prepare for and cope with pain. It is 
used for postoperative pain, cancer pain, and the pain of childbirth.</p> 
<p><b>Counseling</b> can give a patient suffering from pain much needed 
support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling. 
Support groups can provide an important adjunct to drug or surgical treatment. 
Psychological treatment can also help patients learn about the physiological 
changes produced by pain.</p> 
<p><b>COX-2 inhibitors (&quot;superaspirins&quot;)</b> may be particularly 
effective for individuals with arthritis. For many years scientists have wanted 
to develop the ultimate drug-a drug that works as well as morphine but without 
its negative side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work 
by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which 
promote production of hormones called<i>prostaglandins</i>, which in turn cause 
inflammation, fever, and pain. Newer drugs, called COX-2 inhibitors, primarily 
block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side 
effects sometimes produced by NSAIDs. On 1999, the Food and Drug Administration 
approved two COX-2 inhibitors-rofecoxib (Vioxx&reg;) and celecoxib 
(Celebrex&reg;). Although the long-term effects of COX-2 inhibitors are still 
being evaluated, they appear to be safe. In addition, patients may be able to 
take COX-2 inhibitors in larger doses than aspirin and other drugs that have 
irritating side effects, earning them the nickname &quot;superaspirins.&quot;
</p> 
<p><b>Electrical stimulation</b>, including transcutaneous electrical 
stimulation (TENS), implanted electric nerve stimulation, and deep brain or 
spinal cord stimulation, is the modern-day extension of age-old practices in 
which the nerves of muscles are subjected to a variety of stimuli, including 
heat or massage. Electrical stimulation, no matter what form, involves a major 
surgical procedure and is not for everyone, nor is it 100 percent effective. 
The following techniques each require specialized equipment and personnel 
trained in the specific procedure being used:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>TENS</b> uses tiny electrical pulses, delivered through the skin to 
nerve fibers, to cause changes in muscles, such as numbness or contractions. 
This in turn produces temporary pain relief. There is also evidence that TENS 
can activate subsets of peripheral nerve fibers that can block pain 
transmission at the spinal cord level, in much the same way that shaking your 
hand can reduce pain.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>Peripheral nerve stimulation</b> uses electrodes placed surgically on a 
carefully selected area of the body. The patient is then able to deliver an 
electrical current as needed to the affected area, using an antenna and 
transmitter.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>Spinal cord stimulation</b> uses electrodes surgically inserted within 
the epidural space of the spinal cord. The patient is able to deliver a pulse 
of electricity to the spinal cord using a small box-like receiver and an 
antenna taped to the skin.
<p></p> </li> 
<li><b>Deep brain or intracerebral stimulation</b> is considered an extreme 
treatment and involves surgical stimulation of the brain, usually the thalamus. 
It is used for a limited number of conditions, including severe pain, central 
pain syndrome, cancer pain, phantom limb pain, and other neuropathic pains.</li>
</ul> 
<p><b>Exercise</b> has come to be a prescribed part of some doctors' treatment 
regimes for patients with pain. Because there is a known link between many 
types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate 
exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of 
well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles. Just as we know that 
stress contributes to pain, we also know that exercise, sleep, and relaxation 
can all help reduce stress, thereby helping to alleviate pain. Exercise has 
been proven to help many people with low back pain. It is important, however, 
that patients carefully follow the routine laid out by their physicians.</p> 
<p><b>Hypnosis</b>, first approved for medical use by the American Medical 
Association in 1958, continues to grow in popularity, especially as an adjunct 
to pain medication. In general, hypnosis is used to control physical function 
or response, that is, the amount of pain an individual can withstand. How 
hypnosis works is not fully understood. Some believe that hypnosis delivers the 
patient into a trance-like state, while others feel that the individual is 
simply better able to concentrate and relax or is more responsive to 
suggestion. Hypnosis may result in relief of pain by acting on chemicals in the 
nervous system, slowing impulses. Whether and how hypnosis works involves 
greater insight-and research-into the mechanisms underlying human consciousness.
</p> 
<p><b>Ibuprofen</b> is a member of the aspirin family of analgesics, the 
so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see below). It is sold over the 
counter and also comes in prescription-strength preparations.</p> 
<p><b>Low-power lasers</b> have been used occasionally by some physical 
therapists as a treatment for pain, but like many other treatments, this method 
is not without controversy.</p> 
<p><b>Magnets</b> are increasingly popular with athletes who swear by their 
effectiveness for the control of sports-related pain and other painful 
conditions. Usually worn as a collar or wristwatch, the use of magnets as a 
treatment dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. While it is often 
dismissed as quackery and pseudoscience by skeptics, proponents offer the 
theory that magnets may effect changes in cells or body chemistry, thus 
producing pain relief.</p> 
<p><b>Narcotics</b> (see Opioids, below).</p> 
<p><b>Nerve blocks</b> employ the use of drugs, chemical agents, or surgical 
techniques to interrupt the relay of pain messages between specific areas of 
the body and the brain. There are many different names for the procedure, 
depending on the technique or agent used. Types of surgical nerve blocks 
include neurectomy; spinal dorsal, cranial, and trigeminal rhizotomy; and 
sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade.</p> 
<p><b>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</b> (including aspirin and 
ibuprofen) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic or 
non-opioid analgesics. They work by reducing inflammatory responses in tissues. 
Many of these drugs irritate the stomach and for that reason are usually taken 
with food. Although acetaminophen may have some anti-inflammatory effects, it 
is generally distinguished from the traditional NSAIDs.</p> 
<p><b>Opioids</b> are derived from the poppy plant and are among the oldest 
drugs known to humankind. They include codeine and perhaps the most well-known 
narcotic of all,<b>morphine</b>. Morphine can be administered in a variety of 
forms, including a pump for patient self-administration. Opioids have a 
narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some 
patients may become physically dependent upon them. For these reasons, patients 
given opioids should be monitored carefully; in some cases stimulants may be 
prescribed to counteract the sedative side effects. In addition to drowsiness, 
other common side effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting.</p> 
<p><b>Physical therapy and rehabilitation</b> date back to the ancient 
practice of using physical techniques and methods, such as heat, cold, 
exercise, massage, and manipulation, in the treatment of certain conditions. 
These may be applied to increase function, control pain, and speed the patient 
toward full recovery.</p> 
<p><b>Placebos</b> offer some individuals pain relief although whether and how 
they have an effect is mysterious and somewhat controversial. Placebos are 
inactive substances, such as sugar pills, or harmless procedures, such as 
saline injections or sham surgeries, generally used in clinical studies as 
control factors to help determine the efficacy of active treatments. Although 
placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from 
clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, 
back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression 
sometimes respond well to them. This positive response is known as the placebo 
effect, which is defined as the observable or measurable change that can occur 
in patients after administration of a placebo. Some experts believe the effect 
is psychological and that placebos work because the patients believe or expect 
them to work. Others say placebos relieve pain by stimulating the brain's own 
analgesics and setting the body's self-healing forces in motion. A third theory 
suggests that the act of taking placebos relieves stress and anxiety-which are 
known to aggravate some painful conditions-and, thus, cause the patients to 
feel better. Still, placebos are considered controversial because by definition 
they are inactive and have no actual curative value.</p> 
<p><b>R.I.C.E.</b>-<b>R</b>est, <b>I</b>ce, <b>C</b>ompression, and <b>E</b>
levation-are four components prescribed by many orthopedists, coaches, 
trainers, nurses, and other professionals for temporary muscle or joint 
conditions, such as sprains or strains. While many common orthopedic problems 
can be controlled with these four simple steps, especially when combined with 
over-the-counter pain relievers, more serious conditions may require surgery or 
physical therapy, including exercise, joint movement or manipulation, and 
stimulation of muscles.</p> 
<p><b>Surgery</b>, although not always an option, may be required to relieve 
pain, especially pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal 
injuries. Surgery may take the form of a nerve block or it may involve an 
operation to relieve pain from a ruptured disc. Surgical procedures for back 
problems include<b>discectomy</b> or, when microsurgical techniques are used, 
<b>microdiscectomy</b>, in which the entire disc is removed; <b>laminectomy</b>
, a procedure in which a surgeon removes only a disc fragment, gaining access 
by entering through the arched portion of a vertebra; and spinal fusion, a 
procedure where the entire disc is removed and replaced with a bone graft. In a
<b>spinal fusion</b>, the two vertebrae are then fused together. Although the 
operation can cause the spine to stiffen, resulting in lost flexibility, the 
procedure serves one critical purpose: protection of the spinal cord. Other 
operations for pain include<b>rhizotomy</b>, in which a nerve close to the 
spinal cord is cut, and<b>cordotomy</b>, where bundles of nerves within the 
spinal cord are severed. Cordotomy is generally used only for the pain of 
terminal cancer that does not respond to other therapies. Another operation for 
pain is the<b>dorsal root entry zone operation</b>, or DREZ, in which spinal 
neurons corresponding to the patient's pain are destroyed surgically. Because 
surgery can result in scar tissue formation that may cause additional problems, 
patients are well advised to seek a second opinion before proceeding. 
Occasionally, surgery is carried out with electrodes that selectively damage 
neurons in a targeted area of the brain. These procedures rarely result in 
long-term pain relief, but both physician and patient may decide that the 
surgical procedure will be effective enough that it justifies the expense and 
risk. In some cases, the results of an operation are remarkable. For example, 
many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to 
drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular 
decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from 
surrounding nerves.</p>

<p> What is the Role of Age and Gender in Pain?</p> 
<p>Gender and Pain</p> 
<p>It is now widely believed that pain affects men and women differently. 
While the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone certainly play a role in this 
phenomenon, psychology and culture, too, may account at least in part for 
differences in how men and women receive pain signals. For example, young 
children may learn to respond to pain based on how they are treated when they 
experience pain. Some children may be cuddled and comforted, while others may 
be encouraged to tough it out and to dismiss their pain.</p> 
<p>Many investigators are turning their attention to the study of gender 
differences and pain. Women, many experts now agree, recover more quickly from 
pain, seek help more quickly for their pain, and are less likely to allow pain 
to control their lives. They also are more likely to marshal a variety of 
resources-coping skills, support, and distraction-with which to deal with their 
pain.</p> 
<p>Research in this area is yielding fascinating results. For example, male 
experimental animals injected with estrogen, a female sex hormone, appear to 
have a lower tolerance for pain-that is, the addition of estrogen appears to 
lower the pain threshold. Similarly, the presence of testosterone, a male 
hormone, appears to elevate tolerance for pain in female mice: the animals are 
simply able to withstand pain better. Female mice deprived of estrogen during 
experiments react to stress similarly to male animals. Estrogen, therefore, may 
act as a sort of pain switch, turning on the ability to recognize pain.</p> 
<p>Investigators know that males and females both have strong natural 
pain-killing systems, but these systems operate differently. For example, a 
class of painkillers called kappa-opioids is named after one of several opioid 
receptors to which they bind, the kappa-opioid receptor, and they include the 
compounds<i>nalbuphine</i> (Nubain&reg;) and <i>butorphanol</i> (Stadol&reg;). 
Research suggests that kappa-opioids provide better pain relief in women.</p> 
<p>Though not prescribed widely, kappa-opioids are currently used for relief 
of labor pain and in general work best for short-term pain. Investigators are 
not certain why kappa-opioids work better in women than men. Is it because a 
woman's estrogen makes them work, or because a man's testosterone prevents them 
from working? Or is there another explanation, such as differences between men 
and women in their perception of pain? Continued research may result in a 
better understanding of how pain affects women differently from men, enabling 
new and better pain medications to be designed with gender in mind.</p> 
<p>Pain in Aging and Pediatric Populations: Special Needs and Concerns</p> 
<p>Pain is the number one complaint of older Americans, and one in five older 
Americans takes a painkiller regularly. In 1998, the American Geriatrics 
Society (AGS) issued guidelines* for the management of pain in older people. 
The AGS panel addressed the incorporation of several non-drug approaches in 
patients' treatment plans, including exercise. AGS panel members recommend 
that, whenever possible, patients use alternatives to aspirin, ibuprofen, and 
other NSAIDs because of the drugs' side effects, including stomach irritation 
and gastrointestinal bleeding. For older adults, acetaminophen is the 
first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate pain, according to the guidelines. 
More serious chronic pain conditions may require opioid drugs (narcotics), 
including codeine or morphine, for relief of pain.</p> 
<p>Pain in younger patients also requires special attention, particularly 
because young children are not always able to describe the degree of pain they 
are experiencing. Although treating pain in pediatric patients poses a special 
challenge to physicians and parents alike, pediatric patients should never be 
undertreated. Recently, special tools for measuring pain in children have been 
developed that, when combined with cues used by parents, help physicians select 
the most effective treatments.</p> 
<p>Nonsteroidal agents, and especially acetaminophen, are most often 
prescribed for control of pain in children. In the case of severe pain or pain 
following surgery, acetaminophen may be combined with codeine.</p>

<p> A Pain Primer: What Do We Know About Pain?</p> 
<p>We may experience pain as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Receptors 
on the skin trigger a series of events, beginning with an electrical impulse 
that travels from the skin to the spinal cord. The spinal cord acts as a sort 
of relay center where the pain signal can be blocked, enhanced, or otherwise 
modified before it is relayed to the brain. One area of the spinal cord in 
particular, called the<i>dorsal horn</i>, is important in the reception of pain 
signals.</p> 
<p>The most common destination in the brain for pain signals is the thalamus 
and from there to the cortex, the headquarters for complex thoughts. The 
thalamus also serves as the brain's storage area for images of the body and 
plays a key role in relaying messages between the brain and various parts of 
the body. In people who undergo an amputation, the representation of the 
amputated limb is stored in the thalamus.</p> 
<p>Pain is a complicated process that involves an intricate interplay between 
a number of important chemicals found naturally in the brain and spinal cord. 
In general, these chemicals, called<i>neurotransmitters</i>, transmit nerve 
impulses from one cell to another.</p> 
<p>There are many different neurotransmitters in the human body; some play a 
role in human disease and, in the case of pain, act in various combinations to 
produce painful sensations in the body. Some chemicals govern mild pain 
sensations; others control intense or severe pain.</p> 
<p>The body's chemicals act in the transmission of pain messages by stimulating
<i>neurotransmitter receptors</i> found on the surface of cells; each receptor 
has a corresponding neurotransmitter. Receptors function much like gates or 
ports and enable pain messages to pass through and on to neighboring cells. One 
brain chemical of special interest to neuroscientists is<i>glutamate</i>. 
During experiments, mice with blocked glutamate receptors show a reduction in 
their responses to pain. Other important receptors in pain transmission are 
opiate-like receptors. Morphine and other opioid drugs work by locking on to 
these opioid receptors, switching on pain-inhibiting pathways or circuits, and 
thereby blocking pain.</p> 
<p>Another type of receptor that responds to painful stimuli is called a <i>
nociceptor</i>. Nociceptors are thin nerve fibers in the skin, muscle, and 
other body tissues, that, when stimulated, carry pain signals to the spinal 
cord and brain. Normally, nociceptors only respond to strong stimuli such as a 
pinch. However, when tissues become injured or inflamed, as with a sunburn or 
infection, they release chemicals that make nociceptors much more sensitive and 
cause them to transmit pain signals in response to even gentle stimuli such as 
breeze or a caress. This condition is called<i>allodynia</i> -a state in which 
pain is produced by innocuous stimuli.</p> 
<p>The body's natural painkillers may yet prove to be the most promising pain 
relievers, pointing to one of the most important new avenues in drug 
development. The brain may signal the release of painkillers found in the 
spinal cord, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and opioid-like chemicals. 
Many pharmaceutical companies are working to synthesize these substances in 
laboratories as future medications.</p> 
<p><i>Endorphins</i> and <i>enkephalins</i> are other natural painkillers. 
Endorphins may be responsible for the &quot;feel good&quot; effects experienced 
by many people after rigorous exercise; they are also implicated in the 
pleasurable effects of smoking.</p> 
<p>Similarly, <i>peptides</i>, compounds that make up proteins in the body, 
play a role in pain responses. Mice bred experimentally to lack a gene for two 
peptides called<i>tachykinins-neurokinin</i> A and substance P-have a reduced 
response to severe pain. When exposed to mild pain, these mice react in the 
same way as mice that carry the missing gene. But when exposed to more severe 
pain, the mice exhibit a reduced pain response. This suggests that the two 
peptides are involved in the production of pain sensations, especially 
moderate-to-severe pain. Continued research on tachykinins, conducted with 
support from the NINDS, may pave the way for drugs tailored to treat different 
severities of pain.</p> 
<p>Scientists are working to develop potent pain-killing drugs that act on 
receptors for the chemical<i>acetylcholine</i>. For example, a type of frog 
native to Ecuador has been found to have a chemical in its skin called 
epibatidine, derived from the frog's scientific name,<i>Epipedobates tricolor
</i>. Although highly toxic, epibatidine is a potent analgesic and, 
surprisingly, resembles the chemical nicotine found in cigarettes. Also under 
development are other less toxic compounds that act on acetylcholine receptors 
and may prove to be more potent than morphine but without its addictive 
properties.</p> 
<p>The idea of using receptors as gateways for pain drugs is a novel idea, 
supported by experiments involving substance P. Investigators have been able to 
isolate a tiny population of neurons, located in the spinal cord, that together 
form a major portion of the pathway responsible for carrying persistent pain 
signals to the brain. When animals were given injections of a lethal cocktail 
containing substance P linked to the chemical saporin, this group of cells, 
whose sole function is to communicate pain, were killed. Receptors for 
substance P served as a portal or point of entry for the compound. Within days 
of the injections, the targeted neurons, located in the outer layer of the 
spinal cord along its entire length, absorbed the compound and were 
neutralized. The animals' behavior was completely normal; they no longer 
exhibited signs of pain following injury or had an exaggerated pain response. 
Importantly, the animals still responded to acute, that is, normal, pain. This 
is a critical finding as it is important to retain the body's ability to detect 
potentially injurious stimuli. The protective, early warning signal that pain 
provides is essential for normal functioning. If this work can be translated 
clinically, humans might be able to benefit from similar compounds introduced, 
for example, through lumbar (spinal) puncture.</p> 
<p>Another promising area of research using the body's natural pain-killing 
abilities is the transplantation of chromaffin cells into the spinal cords of 
animals bred experimentally to develop arthritis. Chromaffin cells produce 
several of the body's pain-killing substances and are part of the adrenal 
medulla, which sits on top of the kidney. Within a week or so, rats receiving 
these transplants cease to exhibit telltale signs of pain. Scientists, working 
with support from the NINDS, believe the transplants help the animals recover 
from pain-related cellular damage. Extensive animal studies will be required to 
learn if this technique might be of value to humans with severe pain.</p> 
<p>One way to control pain outside of the brain, that is, peripherally, is by 
inhibiting hormones called<i>prostaglandins</i>. Prostaglandins stimulate 
nerves at the site of injury and cause inflammation and fever. Certain drugs, 
including NSAIDs, act against such hormones by blocking the enzyme that is 
required for their synthesis.</p> 
<p>Blood vessel walls stretch or dilate during a migraine attack and it is 
thought that serotonin plays a complicated role in this process. For example, 
before a migraine headache, serotonin levels fall. Drugs for migraine include 
the triptans: sumatriptan (Imitrix&reg;), naratriptan (Amerge&reg;), and 
zolmitriptan (Zomig&reg;). They are called<i>serotonin</i> agonists because 
they mimic the action of endogenous (natural) serotonin and bind to specific 
subtypes of serotonin receptors.</p> 
<p>Ongoing pain research, much of it supported by the NINDS, continues to 
reveal at an unprecedented pace fascinating insights into how genetics, the 
immune system, and the skin contribute to pain responses.</p> 
<p>The explosion of knowledge about human genetics is helping scientists who 
work in the field of drug development. We know, for example, that the 
pain-killing properties of codeine rely heavily on a liver enzyme, CYP2D6, 
which helps convert codeine into morphine. A small number of people genetically 
lack the enzyme CYP2D6; when given codeine, these individuals do not get pain 
relief. CYP2D6 also helps break down certain other drugs. People who 
genetically lack CYP2D6 may not be able to cleanse their systems of these drugs 
and may be vulnerable to drug toxicity. CYP2D6 is currently under investigation 
for its role in pain.</p> 
<p>In his research, the late John C. Liebeskind, a renowned pain expert and a 
professor of psychology at UCLA, found that pain can kill by delaying healing 
and causing cancer to spread. In his pioneering research on the immune system 
and pain, Dr. Liebeskind studied the effects of stress-such as surgery-on the 
immune system and in particular on cells called<i>natural killer</i> or <i>NK 
cells</i>. These cells are thought to help protect the body against tumors. In 
one study conducted with rats, Dr. Liebeskind found that, following 
experimental surgery, NK cell activity was suppressed, causing the cancer to 
spread more rapidly. When the animals were treated with morphine, however, they 
were able to avoid this reaction to stress.</p> 
<p>The link between the nervous and immune systems is an important one. 
Cytokines, a type of protein found in the nervous system, are also part of the 
body's immune system, the body's shield for fighting off disease. Cytokines can 
trigger pain by promoting inflammation, even in the absence of injury or 
damage. Certain types of cytokines have been linked to nervous system injury. 
After trauma, cytokine levels rise in the brain and spinal cord and at the site 
in the peripheral nervous system where the injury occurred. Improvements in our 
understanding of the precise role of cytokines in producing pain, especially 
pain resulting from injury, may lead to new classes of drugs that can block the 
action of these substances.</p> 
<p>Return to top </p> 
<p> What is the Future of Pain Research?</p> 
<p>In the forefront of pain research are scientists supported by the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH), including the NINDS. Other institutes at NIH that 
support pain research include the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial 
Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Nursing 
Research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute of 
Mental Health. Developing better pain treatments is the primary goal of all 
pain research being conducted by these institutes.</p> 
<p>Some pain medications dull the patient's perception of pain. Morphine is 
one such drug. It works through the body's natural pain-killing machinery, 
preventing pain messages from reaching the brain. Scientists are working toward 
the development of a morphine-like drug that will have the pain-deadening 
qualities of morphine but without the drug's negative side effects, such as 
sedation and the potential for addiction. Patients receiving morphine also face 
the problem of morphine tolerance, meaning that over time they require higher 
doses of the drug to achieve the same pain relief. Studies have identified 
factors that contribute to the development of tolerance; continued progress in 
this line of research should eventually allow patients to take lower doses of 
morphine.</p> 
<p>One objective of investigators working to develop the future generation of 
pain medications is to take full advantage of the body's pain &quot;switching 
center&quot; by formulating compounds that will prevent pain signals from being 
amplified or stop them altogether. Blocking or interrupting pain signals, 
especially when there is no injury or trauma to tissue, is an important goal in 
the development of pain medications. An increased understanding of the basic 
mechanisms of pain will have profound implications for the development of 
future medicines. The following areas of research are bringing us closer to an 
ideal pain drug.</p> 
<p><i>Systems and Imaging</i>: The idea of mapping cognitive functions to 
precise areas of the brain dates back to phrenology, the now archaic practice 
of studying bumps on the head. Positron emission tomography (PET), functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and other imaging technologies offer a vivid 
picture of what is happening in the brain as it processes pain. Using imaging, 
investigators can now see that pain activates at least three or four key areas 
of the brain's cortex-the layer of tissue that covers the brain. Interestingly, 
when patients undergo hypnosis so that the unpleasantness of a painful stimulus 
is not experienced, activity in some, but not all, brain areas is reduced. This 
emphasizes that the experience of pain involves a strong emotional component as 
well as the sensory experience, namely the intensity of the stimulus.</p> 
<p><i>Channels</i>: The frontier in the search for new drug targets is 
represented by channels. Channels are gate-like passages found along the 
membranes of cells that allow electrically charged chemical particles called 
ions to pass into the cells. Ion channels are important for transmitting 
signals through the nerve's membrane. The possibility now exists for developing 
new classes of drugs, including pain cocktails that would act at the site of 
channel activity.</p> 
<p><i>Trophic Factors</i>: A class of &quot;rescuer&quot; or 
&quot;restorer&quot; drugs may emerge from our growing knowledge of trophic 
factors, natural chemical substances found in the human body that affect the 
survival and function of cells. Trophic factors also promote cell death, but 
little is known about how something beneficial can become harmful. 
Investigators have observed that an over-accumulation of certain trophic 
factors in the nerve cells of animals results in heightened pain sensitivity, 
and that some receptors found on cells respond to trophic factors and interact 
with each other. These receptors may provide targets for new pain therapies.</p>
<p><i>Molecular Genetics</i>: Certain genetic mutations can change pain 
sensitivity and behavioral responses to pain. People born genetically insensate 
to pain-that is, individuals who cannot feel pain-have a mutation in part of a 
gene that plays a role in cell survival. Using &quot;knockout&quot; animal 
models-animals genetically engineered to lack a certain gene-scientists are 
able to visualize how mutations in genes cause animals to become anxious, make 
noise, rear, freeze, or become hypervigilant. These genetic mutations cause a 
disruption or alteration in the processing of pain information as it leaves the 
spinal cord and travels to the brain. Knockout animals can be used to 
complement efforts aimed at developing new drugs.</p> 
<p><i>Plasticity</i>: Following injury, the nervous system undergoes a 
tremendous reorganization. This phenomenon is known as plasticity. For example, 
the spinal cord is &quot;rewired&quot; following trauma as nerve cell axons 
make new contacts, a phenomenon known as &quot;sprouting.&quot; This in turn 
disrupts the cells' supply of trophic factors. Scientists can now identify and 
study the changes that occur during the processing of pain. For example, using 
a technique called polymerase chain reaction, abbreviated PCR, scientists can 
study the genes that are induced by injury and persistent pain. There is 
evidence that the proteins that are ultimately synthesized by these genes may 
be targets for new therapies. The dramatic changes that occur with injury and 
persistent pain underscore that chronic pain should be considered a disease of 
the nervous system, not just prolonged acute pain or a symptom of an injury. 
Thus, scientists hope that therapies directed at preventing the long-term 
changes that occur in the nervous system will prevent the development of 
chronic pain conditions.</p> 
<p><i>Neurotransmitters</i>: Just as mutations in genes may affect behavior, 
they may also affect a number of neurotransmitters involved in the control of 
pain. Using sophisticated imaging technologies, investigators can now visualize 
what is happening chemically in the spinal cord. From this work, new therapies 
may emerge, therapies that can help reduce or obliterate severe or chronic pain.

<p> Hope for the Future</p> 
<p>Thousands of years ago, ancient peoples attributed pain to spirits and 
treated it with mysticism and incantations. Over the centuries, science has 
provided us with a remarkable ability to understand and control pain with 
medications, surgery, and other treatments. Today, scientists understand a 
great deal about the causes and mechanisms of pain, and research has produced 
dramatic improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of painful 
disorders. For people who fight every day against the limitations imposed by 
pain, the work of NINDS-supported scientists holds the promise of an even 
greater understanding of pain in the coming years. Their research offers a 
powerful weapon in the battle to prolong and improve the lives of people with 
pain:<i>hope</i>. </p>

<p> Appendix</p> 
<p>Spine Basics: The Vertebrae, Discs, and Spinal Cord</p> 
<p>Stacked on top of one another in the spine are more than 30 bones, the 
vertebrae, which together form the spine. They are divided into four regions:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the seven cervical or neck vertebrae (labeled C1-C7), </li> 
<li>the 12 thoracic or upper back vertebrae (labeled T1-T12), </li> 
<li>the five lumbar vertebrae (labeled L1-L5), which we know as the lower 
back, and</li> 
<li>the sacrum and coccyx, a group of bones fused together at the base of the 
spine.</li> </ul> 
<p>The vertebrae are linked by ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Back pain can 
occur when, for example, someone lifts something too heavy, causing a sprain, 
pull, strain, or spasm in one of these muscles or ligaments in the back.</p> 
<p>Between the vertebrae are round, spongy pads of cartilage called <i>discs
</i> that act much like shock absorbers. In many cases, degeneration or 
pressure from overexertion can cause a disc to shift or protrude and bulge, 
causing pressure on a nerve and resultant pain. When this happens, the 
condition is called a slipped, bulging, herniated, or ruptured disc, and it 
sometimes results in permanent nerve damage.</p> 
<p>The column-like spinal cord is divided into segments similar to the 
corresponding vertebrae: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. The 
cord also has nerve roots and rootlets which form branch-like appendages 
leading from its ventral side (that is, the front of the body) and from its 
dorsal side (that is, the back of the body). Along the dorsal root are the 
cells of the dorsal root ganglia, which are critical in the transmission of 
&quot;pain&quot; messages from the cord to the brain. It is here where injury, 
damage, and trauma become pain.</p> 
<p>The Nervous Systems</p> 
<p>The central nervous system (CNS) refers to the brain and spinal cord 
together. The peripheral nervous system refers to the cervical, thoracic, 
lumbar, and sacral nerve trunks leading away from the spine to the limbs. 
Messages related to function (such as movement) or dysfunction (such as pain) 
travel from the brain to the spinal cord and from there to other regions in the 
body and back to the brain again. The autonomic nervous system controls 
involuntary functions in the body, like perspiration, blood pressure, heart 
rate, or heart beat. It is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
nervous systems. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have links 
to important organs and systems in the body; for example, the sympathetic 
nervous system controls the heart, blood vessels, and respiratory system, while 
the parasympathetic nervous system controls our ability to sleep, eat, and 
digest food.</p> 
<p>The peripheral nervous system also includes 12 pairs of cranial nerves 
located on the underside of the brain. Most relay messages of a sensory nature. 
They include the olfactory (I), optic (II), oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), 
trigeminal (V), abducens (VI), facial (VII), vestibulocochlear (VIII), 
glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), accessory (XI), and hypoglossal (XII) nerves. 
Neuralgia, as in trigeminal neuralgia, is a term that refers to pain that 
arises from abnormal activity of a nerve trunk or its branches. The type and 
severity of pain associated with neuralgia vary widely.</p> 
<p>Phantom Pain: How Does the Brain <i>Feel</i>?</p> 
<p>Sometimes, when a limb is removed during an amputation, an individual will 
continue to have an internal sense of the lost limb. This phenomenon is known 
as phantom limb and accounts describing it date back to the 1800s. Similarly, 
many amputees are frequently aware of severe pain in the absent limb. Their 
pain is real and is often accompanied by other health problems, such as 
depression.</p> 
<p>What causes this phenomenon? Scientists believe that following amputation, 
nerve cells &quot;rewire&quot; themselves and continue to receive messages, 
resulting in a remapping of the brain's circuitry. The brain's ability to 
restructure itself, to change and adapt following injury, is called plasticity 
(see section on Plasticity).</p> 
<p>Our understanding of phantom pain has improved tremendously in recent 
years. Investigators previously believed that brain cells affected by 
amputation simply died off. They attributed sensations of pain at the site of 
the amputation to irritation of nerves located near the limb stump. Now, using 
imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), scientists can actually visualize increased activity 
in the brain's cortex when an individual feels phantom pain. When study 
participants move the stump of an amputated limb, neurons in the brain remain 
dynamic and excitable. Surprisingly, the brain's cells can be stimulated by 
other body parts, often those located closest to the missing limb.</p> 
<p>Treatments for phantom pain may include analgesics, anticonvulsants, and 
other types of drugs; nerve blocks; electrical stimulation; psychological 
counseling, biofeedback, hypnosis, and acupuncture; and, in rare instances, 
surgery.</p> 
<p>Chili Peppers, Capsaicin, and Pain</p> 
<p>The hot feeling, red face, and watery eyes you experience when you bite 
into a red chili pepper may make you reach for a cold drink, but that reaction 
has also given scientists important information about pain. The chemical found 
in chili peppers that causes those feelings is<i>capsaicin</i> (pronounced 
cap-SAY-sin), and it works its unique magic by grabbing onto receptors 
scattered along the surface of sensitive nerve cells in the mouth.</p> 
<p>In 1997, scientists at the University of California at San Francisco 
discovered a gene for a capsaicin receptor, called the vanilloid receptor. Once 
in contact with capsaicin, vanilloid receptors open and pain signals are sent 
from the peripheral nociceptor and through central nervous system circuits to 
the brain. Investigators have also learned that this receptor plays a role in 
the burning type of pain commonly associated with heat, such as the kind you 
experience when you touch your finger to a hot stove. The vanilloid receptor 
functions as a sort of &quot;ouch gateway,&quot; enabling us to detect burning 
hot pain, whether it originates from a 3-alarm habanera chili or from a stove 
burner.</p> 
<p>Capsaicin is currently available as a prescription or over-the-counter 
cream for the treatment of a number of pain conditions, such as shingles. It 
works by reducing the amount of substance P found in nerve endings and 
interferes with the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Individuals can 
become desensitized to the compound, however, perhaps because of long-term 
damage to nerve tissue. Some individuals find the burning sensation they 
experience when using capsaicin cream to be intolerable, especially when they 
are already suffering from a painful condition, such as postherpetic neuralgia. 
Soon, however, better treatments that relieve pain by blocking vanilloid 
receptors may arrive in drugstores.</p> 
<p>Marijuana</p> 
<p>As a painkiller, marijuana or, by its Latin name, <i>cannabis</i>, 
continues to remain highly controversial. In the eyes of many individuals 
campaigning on its behalf, marijuana rightfully belongs with other pain 
remedies. In fact, for many years, it was sold under highly controlled 
conditions in cigarette form by the Federal government for just that purpose.
</p> 
<p>In 1997, the National Institutes of Health held a workshop to discuss 
research on the possible therapeutic uses for smoked marijuana. Panel members 
from a number of fields reviewed published research and heard presentations 
from pain experts. The panel members concluded that, because there are too few 
scientific studies to prove marijuana's therapeutic utility for certain 
conditions, additional research is needed. There is evidence, however, that 
receptors to which marijuana binds are found in many brain regions that process 
information that can produce pain.</p> 
<p>Nerve Blocks</p> 
<p>Nerve blocks may involve local anesthesia, regional anesthesia or 
analgesia, or surgery; dentists routinely use them for traditional dental 
procedures. Nerve blocks can also be used to prevent or even diagnose pain.</p> 
<p>In the case of a local nerve block, any one of a number of local 
anesthetics may be used; the names of these compounds, such as lidocaine or 
novocaine, usually have an<i>aine</i> ending. Regional blocks affect a larger 
area of the body. Nerve blocks may also take the form of what is commonly 
called an epidural, in which a drug is administered into the space between the 
spine's protective covering (the dura) and the spinal column. This procedure is 
most well known for its use during childbirth. Morphine and methadone are 
opioid narcotics (such drugs end in ine or one) that are sometimes used for 
regional analgesia and are administered as an injection.</p> 
<p>Neurolytic blocks employ injection of chemical agents such as alcohol, 
phenol, or glycerol to block pain messages and are most often used to treat 
cancer pain or to block pain in the cranial nerves. In some cases, a drug 
called guanethidine is administered intravenously in order to accomplish the 
block.</p> 
<p>Surgical blocks are performed on cranial, peripheral, or sympathetic 
nerves. They are most often done to relieve the pain of cancer and extreme 
facial pain, such as that experienced with trigeminal neuralgia. There are 
several different types of surgical nerve blocks and they are not without 
problems and complications. Nerve blocks can cause muscle paralysis and, in 
many cases, result in at least partial numbness. For that reason, the procedure 
should be reserved for a select group of patients and should only be performed 
by skilled surgeons. Types of surgical nerve blocks include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Neurectomy</b> (including peripheral neurectomy) in which a damaged 
peripheral nerve is destroyed.</li> 
<li><b>Spinal dorsal rhizotomy</b> in which the surgeon cuts the root or 
rootlets of one or more of the nerves radiating from the spine. Other rhizotomy 
procedures include<b>cranial rhizotomy</b> and <b>trigeminal rhizotomy</b>, 
performed as a treatment for extreme facial pain or for the pain of cancer.</li>
<li><b>Sympathectomy</b>, also called <b>sympathetic blockade</b>, in which a 
drug or an agent such as guanethidine is used to eliminate pain in a specific 
area (a limb, for example). The procedure is also done for cardiac pain, 
vascular disease pain, the pain of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, and 
other conditions. The term takes its name from the sympathetic nervous system 
and may involve, for example, cutting a nerve that controls contraction of one 
or more arteries.</li> </ul>
