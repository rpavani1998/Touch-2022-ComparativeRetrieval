<p> <b>Pain Relief - Herbal, Safe, Effective </b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> A natural COX-II inhibitor, for all natural relief from minor pain 
associated with occasional tension, stress and over-exertion.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p>Stress. Tension. Aches and minor pains. No, they don&#146;t have to be 
accepted as part of modern life. Planetary Herbals brings you MINOR PAIN 
RELIEF, a safe, effective herbal formula that soothes minor pain, inhibits 
COX-2 inflammatory response, and strengthens the body with antioxidants.</p> 
<p>The formula contains corydalis, from Chinese herbalism; hops from European 
herbal traditions; willow bark, used for centuries for natural minor pain 
relief; and ginger, which supports the body&#146;s healthy defenses, soothes 
minor pain, and fortifies with powerful antioxidants and COX-2 inhibitors.</p> 
<p>This remedy is neither habit forming nor irritating to the stomach. 
Planetary Herbals is pleased to bring you this safe, effective remedy to 
support your health and well-being.</p> 
<p><b>Corydalis </b></p> 
<p>Corydalis (Corydalis yanhusuo), a member of the poppy family, has been used 
successfully for over 2,000 years within the system of traditional Chinese 
herbalism to inhibit minor, everyday pain. Scientific tests have identified and 
named 20 active minor pain-killing alkaloids in corydalis, and chief among 
these is tetrahydropalmatine (THP), which inhibits the reticular-activating 
system in the brain stem. This system is composed of intertwined nerve fibers, 
called axons, which link the brain to the spinal cord. THP, in effect, 
deactivates the nerve cell pathway between where minor pain is felt and where 
it is registered. Corydalis has also been shown to support healthy 
cardiovascular processes such as regular heartbeat and blood pressure.</p> 
<p><b>Hops </b></p> 
<p>Hops (Humulus lupulus) is a bitter-tasting climbing perennial vine used 
worldwide in beer-making. Pliny the Elder (23 AD-79 AD) recorded that the 
ancient Romans ate the shoots of the plant the way that we eat asparagus. MINOR 
PAIN RELIEF contains a standardized extract of hops, called Humulex&#153;. 
Modern research has documented that Humulex, the alpha acid of hops, can be 
used to relieve minor pain as well as the minor, everyday, cellular swelling 
and irritation that goes along with it. Humulex&#153; includes humulone, 
cohumulone and isohumulone, all of which have proved effective at inhibiting 
the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-2). The COX-2 enzyme helps convert omega-6 
arachidonic acid to prostaglandin-2 (PGE-2), a prostaglandin that can lead to 
cellular irritation and swelling. When COX-2 is inhibited by Humulex&#153;, 
PGE-2 levels fall, lessening minor cellular swelling and irritation.</p> 
<p><b>Willow Bark </b></p> 
<p>Willow bark (Salix spp) has been used for health for approximately 2,000 
years. The Greeks used it in the first century. In 1757, willow bark was known 
to be employed by English doctors to reduce occasional minor aches and pains. 
By 1829, scientists discovered that it was a compound called salicin in willow 
bark that gave minor pain relief. A few years later, the salicylic acid was 
buffered with sodium and acetyl chloride, making acetylsalicylic acid, better 
known as aspirin. Modern clinical studies prove that willow bark remains as 
effective as ever for the relief of minor pain and inflammatory mechanisms.</p> 
<p><b>Ginger</b> </p> 
<p>Ginger (Zingiber officinale) lessens everyday minor pain and the cellular 
irritation that accompanies it by decreasing the production of prostaglandins 
generated by the COX-2 enzyme. Oils that make up the vast majority of those in 
the American diet&#151;omega-6 fatty acids&#151;are converted by the body into 
arachidonic acid, which in turn can develop into prostaglandin-2 (PGE-2), among 
the body&#146;s chemicals that result in occasional, everyday minor pain. 
Unlike many other compounds, ginger is renowned for being easy on the stomach. 
Ginger is non-irritating and contains powerful antioxidants that strengthen and 
support the body on a cellular level. Ginger, as well as corydalis, promotes 
healthy tissues and good circulation. Planetary Herbals integrates the best of 
worldwide herbal traditions with modern clinical and pharmacological research. 
The result: an herbal product line that is unequalled for efficacy, safety, and 
dependability.</p>

cross-reactions may occur in patients allergic to aspirin.</p> 
<p>Do not take for pain for more than 10 days or for fever for more than 3 
days unless directed by a doctor.&nbsp; If pain or fever persists or gets

a doctor.&nbsp; These could be signs of a serious illness.&nbsp; If you are 
under a doctor's care for any serious conditions, consult a doctor before 
taking this product&nbsp;&nbsp; As with aspirin and acetaminophen, if you have 
any condition which requires you to take prescription drugs or if you have had 
any problems or serious side effects from taking any non-prescription pain 
reliever, do not take Ibuprofen caplets without first discussing it with your 
doctor.&nbsp; If you experience any symptoms which are unusual or seem 
unrelated to the condition for which you took Ibuprofen, consult a doctor 
before taking any more of it.&nbsp; Although Ibuprofen is indicated for the 
same conditions as aspirin and acetaminophen, it should not be taken with them 
except under a doctor's direction. Do not combine this product with any other 
Ibuprofen containing product.&nbsp; As with any drug, if you are pregnant or 
nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional before using this 
product.&nbsp;<strong>It is especially important not to use Ibuprofen during 
the last 3 months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by a 
doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or complications 
during delivery.&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Alcohol warning: </strong>If you consume 3 or more alcoholic drinks

relievers/fever reducers.&nbsp; Ibuprofen may cause stomach bleeding.&nbsp;</p>

directed by a doctor. The smallest effective dose should be used.&nbsp; Take 
with food or milk if occasional and mild heartburn, upset stomach, or stomach 
pain occurs with use.&nbsp; Consult a doctor if these symptoms are more than 
mild or if they persist.&nbsp;</p>
