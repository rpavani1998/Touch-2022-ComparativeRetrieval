Old Faithful<br>
One Aspirin Alternative
<br>From Prescription to Over-the-Counter<br>
<br>
Used to be, aspirin and 
other salicylates were the only medications available for nonprescription 
relief of minor ailments--from headaches and fever to muscle strain and minor 
arthritis. Today, consumers looking for temporary relief from such 
garden-variety ills have their pick of what can be a bewildering array of 
&quot;regular,&quot; &quot;extra-strength,&quot; and &quot;maximum&nbsp;
relief&quot; tablets, caplets and gel caps on the drugstore shelf. Though this 
cornucopia can seem confusing, the products' relieving ingredients fall into 
just four categories: aspirin (and other salicylates), acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium.<br>
<br>
For the most part, these 
over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic ingredients are equally effective. However, 
some may be more effective for certain types of ailments, and some people may 
prefer one type to another because of their varying side effects. &quot;Knowing 
the pros and cons of each type of&nbsp;reliever will allow you to choose among 
them,&quot; says William T. Beaver, M.D., professor of pharmacology and 
anesthesia at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.<br>

<br><strong>Old Faithful</strong><br>
<br>
Americans have been reaching for 
aspirin for almost 100 years as an all-purpose&nbsp; reliever (see 
&quot;Aspirin: A New Look at an Old Drug&quot; in the January-February 1994 FDA 
Consumer). Aspirin (oracetylsalicylic acid) works in part by suppressing the 
production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have wide-ranging 
roles throughout the body, such as stimulating uterine contractions, regulating 
body temperature and blood vessel constriction, and helping blood clotting. 
&quot;Regular&quot; strength aspirin contains 325 milligrams (mg) per tablet; 
&quot;extra&quot; or &quot;maximum&quot; strength, 500 mg per tablet. The usual 
adult (defined as12 years and older) dosage is one to two 325-mg aspirin 
tablets every four hours. Some manufacturers add caffeine to aspirin. 
&quot;There is no evidence that caffeine relieves pain&nbsp;, but it can 
enhance the effects of aspirin, possibly by lifting a person's mood,&quot; says 
Michael Weintraub, M.D., director of FDA's Office of OTC Drug Evaluation.<br>

<br>Since a two-tablet dose provides roughly the same amount of caffeine as a 
cup of coffee, you can get the same effect by taking two plain aspirin with 
coffee. To minimize the stomach irritation aspirin can cause, some brands are 
&quot;buffered&quot; with calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, and other 
antacids or coated so the pills don't dissolve until they reach the small 
intestine. Buffered formulas may offset aspirin'sdirectly irritating effects on 
the stomach lining. They may be useful for people who get heartburn or stomach
&nbsp;pain when they take aspirin, as well as for those with arthritis, who 
need to take as much as 4,000 mg every day. Aspirin also causes 
gastrointestinal (GI) upset indirectly (by inhibiting production of a 
prostaglandin that protects the stomach lining by stimulating mucus 
production); buffering does nothing to offset this effect. The downside of 
coated aspirin products is that they may take up to twice as long to provide
&nbsp; relief as plain aspirin, according to Weintraub.<br>
<br>
Last 
September, an FDA advisory panel recommended that labels on products containing 
aspirin warn that heavy drinkers are especially vulnerable to developing GI 
bleeding. Aspirin should not be taken by people who have:<br>
<br>
- ulcers, 
because it can worsen symptoms<br>
- asthma, because it can trigger an attack 
in some asthmatics<br>
- uncontrolled high blood pressure, because of an 
increased risk of one type of stroke<br>
- liver or kidney disease, because it 
may worsen these conditions<br>
- bleeding disorders or who are taking 
anticoagulant medication, because it may cause bleeding.<br>
<br>
Continual 
high dosages of aspirin can cause hearing loss or tinnitis--a persistent 
ringing in the ears. FDA requires products containing aspirin and other 
salicylates to carry a label warning that children and teenagers should not use 
the medicine for chickenpox or flu symptoms because of its association with 
Reyes syndrome, a rare disorder that may cause seizures, brain damage, and 
death. The label also alerts pregnant women that use of aspirin in the last 
trimester may increase the risk of stillbirth and of maternal and fetal 
bleeding during delivery.<br>
<br>
<strong>One Aspirin Alternative</strong><br>

<br>Twenty years ago, FDA approved acetaminophen (Tylenol, and other brands and 
generics) in dosages of 325 mg and 500 mg for OTC use. &quot;Nobody knows 
exactly how acetaminophen works, but one theory is that it acts on nerve 
endings to suppress&nbsp; pain,&quot; says Weintraub. Acetaminophen is as 
effective as aspirin in relieving mild-to-moderate&nbsp;pain and in reducing 
fever, but less so when it comes to soft tissue injuries, such as muscle 
strains and sprains, he adds. The usual adult dosage is two 325-mg tablets 
every four hours. Acetaminophen-based products to ease menstrual cramps often 
contain other ingredients, such as pamabrom (a diuretic) orpyrilamine maleate 
(an antihistamine used for its sedative effects). &quot;While these ingredients 
are safe, they have not been proven effective against uterine cramps, although 
they may relieve other symptoms associated with menstrual pain.&quot; says 
Weintraub. Though acetaminophen is no better or faster at&nbsp;relief than 
aspirin, the drug is gentler on the stomach and reduces fever without the risk 
of Reyes syndrome. However, even at moderate doses, acetaminophen can cause 
liver damage in heavy drinkers. At press time, FDA was planning to require a 
warning about this on the labels of OTC products containing the drug.<br>
<br>

<strong>From Prescription to Over-the-Counter</strong></p> 
<p>Like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium inhibit prostaglandin 
production. However, they are more potent relievers, especially for menstrual 
cramps, toothaches, minor arthritis, and injuries accompanied by inflammation, 
such as tendinitis. FDA approved ibuprofen for OTC marketing in 1984 at a 
dosage level of 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours, and naproxen sodium in1994 at a 
dosage level of 200 mg every 8 to 12 hours. &quot;Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium 
were converted to OTC status after their manufacturers did the necessary 
studies to show that these relievers were effective at OTC dosages, which are 
lower than prescription dosages,&quot; explains Weintraub. The lowest dosage 
strength for prescription-strength ibuprofen (Motrin and others) is 300 mg per 
tablet, and 275 mg per tablet for the prescription version of naproxen sodium 
(Anaprox, for example). &quot;In addition, the pharmaceutical companies had to 
show that these drugs were safe for use by a larger, more varied group of 
people [than would have received them by prescription only] and that the drugs 
were safe to use without medical supervision, as is the case with all 
nonprescription drugs.&quot; Taken at the recommended adult dosage, OTC 
ibuprofen (Advil and others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) are somewhat gentler 
on the stomach than aspirin.<br>
<br>
However, people who have ulcers or who 
get GI upset when taking aspirin should avoid both. In addition, asthmatics and 
people who are allergic to aspirin should avoid ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. 
An FDA advisory panel has recommended labeling on ibuprofen products like that 
recommended for aspirin, warning heavy drinkers about increased risk of gastric 
bleeding and impaired liver function (products with naproxen sodium labels 
already include this information). Although ibuprofen and naproxen sodium 
interfere with blood clotting much less than aspirin does, they should not be 
used by people who have bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulants.<br>
<br>Children under 12 should not be given either drug, except under a doctor's 
supervision, and people over 65 are advised to take no more than one naproxen 
sodium tablet every 12 hours. Choosing an OTC&nbsp;reliever involves balancing 
effectiveness for a particular ailment with side effects. Often this is a very 
individual choice, based in part on your health history and how the drug 
affects you. Regardless of which type of OTC&nbsp;reliever you choose, remember 
that it is intended to be used on a short-term basis, unless directed by a 
doctor, cautions Weintraub. The warning labels on these products include 
limitations on duration of use to ensure that chronic or serious illnesses are 
not masked. Typically, labels advise against taking the product for more than 
10 days to relieve&nbsp;pain (for children, the upper limit is five days), or 
more than three days to reduce fever. If symptoms worsen,&nbsp;pain persists, 
or there is redness or swelling, medical attention should be sought.</p>
