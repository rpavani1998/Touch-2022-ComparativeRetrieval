Information 
<p>Pain medicines are also called analgesics. Every type of pain medicine has 
benefits and risks. Specific types of pain may respond better to one kind of 
medication than to another kind. What takes away your pain might not work for 
someone else.</p> 
<p>OVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN MEDICINES</p> 
<p>Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are good for many types of pain. OTC 
medicines include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acetaminophen (Tylenol)</li> 
<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</li> </ul> 
<p>Acetaminophen is a non-aspirin pain reliever. It can be used to lower a 
fever and soothe headaches and other common aches and pains. However, 
acetaminophen does not reduce swelling (inflammation). This medicine is easier 
on the stomach than other pain medications, and it is safer for children. It 
can, however, be harmful to the liver if you take more than the recommended 
dose. See:Acetaminophen overdose</p> 
<p>NSAIDs include aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen. These medicines relieve 
pain, but they also reduce inflammation caused by injury,arthritis, or fever. 
NSAIDs work by reducing the production of hormone-like substances that cause 
pain.</p> 
<p><strong>DO NOT give aspirin to children</strong>. Reye syndrome is 
associated with the use of aspirin to treat children with viral infections, 
such as chicken pox or the flu.</p> 
<p>If you have high blood pressure, kidney disease, or a history of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, you should talk to your health care provider before 
using any over-the-counter NSAID.</p> 
<p>PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICINES</p> 
<p>Prescription medications may be needed for other types of pain. COX-2 
inhibitors are a type of prescription painkiller that block an 
inflammation-promoting substance called COX-2. This class of drugs was 
initially believed to work as well as traditional NSAIDs, but with fewer 
stomach problems. However, numerous reports of heart attacks and stroke have 
prompted the FDA to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of the COX-2s. Patients 
should ask their doctor whether a COX-2 drug is appropriate and safe for them.
</p> 
<p>Narcotic painkillers are very strong, potentially habit-forming medicines 
used to treat severe pain. They include morphine and codeine.</p> 
<p>Talk to your doctor if your pain lasts longer than a few days, if 
over-the-counter pain medications do not relieve your pain, or if other 
symptoms develop. A pain specialist may be needed to help control long-term 
pain.</p> 
<p>ALTERNATIVES TO PAIN MEDICINE</p> 
<p>You might ask your doctor about alternatives to pain medicines, which 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Heat</li> 
<li>Ice</li> 
<li>Massage</li> 
<li>Rest</li> 
<li>Biofeedback</li> 
<li>Relaxation techniques</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
