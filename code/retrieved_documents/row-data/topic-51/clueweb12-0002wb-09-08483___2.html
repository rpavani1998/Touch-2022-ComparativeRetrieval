<li>children's cold medications</li> </ul>  Countless cold and cough 
medications are out there for kids. Most parents just want their kids to feel 
better when they get sick and who can blame them? Unfortunately, all those 
kids' cold medications don't provide the relief they claim to. Many studies 
performed on these medications have found that their efficacy is doubtful and 
the side effects are not worth the risk. This list will cover the major types 
of medications for kids and what, if any, benefit they may have for your child. 
<h3>1. Pain Relievers/Fever Reducers</h3>This includes acetaminophen (Tylenol) 
and ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil). Children under age 18 should not be given 
aspirin unless instructed by a doctor because of a potentially life threatening 
illness called Reye's syndrome. Acetaminophen is generally considered safe in 
infants and children over 2 months old but you should check with your child's 
doctor for dosing instructions and never give more than 5 doses in 24 hours. It 
is very easy to overdose on acetaminophen, which could cause serious harm. 
Ibuprofen is considered safe for children over 6 months old but you should 
check with child's doctor for dosing instructions. Ibuprofen can sometimes 
cause upset stomach so it should be avoided when a child may have stomach pain. 
<h3>2. Antihistamines</h3>This includes any medication used for runny noses 
and itching. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and loratidine (Claritin) are the most 
widely recognized over-the-counter antihistamines. They have been found to be 
effective for treating allergies and allergic reactions, but studies have 
revealed they are ineffective in relieving symptoms when a child has a cold. 
There is some evidence that antihistamines can cause sedation when compared 
with alternative. In some cases though, antihistamines may cause children to 
become restless, irritable and have difficulty sleeping. Because of the lack 
symptom relief and the potential side effects, antihistamines should not be 
given to a child under 4 years old and should be used with caution in older 
kids. 
<h3>3. Decongestants</h3>Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), 
have little effect in children when they have colds or upper respiratory 
infections. They are also prone to causing irritability, restlessness and 
nervousness. Since they have no proven benefit for common viral illnesses, they 
are generally not worth the potential side effects. 
<h3>4. Cough Medications</h3>Coughing is the body's way of clearing out the 
lungs and generally should not be suppressed. If your child has a cough that 
persists, his doctor should evaluate him so he can treat the underlying cause 
of the cough. Cough suppressants should be avoided because stopping a cough can 
lead to more serious illness, and the safety and efficacy of cough suppressants 
have been questioned in some studies. Expectorants may help loosen a child's 
cough if it is dry ornon-productive. You should always check with your child's 
doctor before giving your child any type of cough medication because he may 
want to see the child first.<br>

<h3>5. Medications for Vomiting/Diarrhea</h3>Vomiting and diarrhea are two of 
the symptoms that frighten parents the most in their children. Most parents 
just want to make their children feel better and want these symptoms to 
disappear. Unfortunately, vomiting and diarrhea are usually the body's way of 
eliminating whatever germ is in it. Stopping the diarrhea and vomiting with 
medication can possibly make things worse. The most important thing to do is to 
make sure your child is staying hydrated with small sips of Gatorade (mixed 
half and half with water) or Pedialyte. Pepto-Bismol should never be given to a 
child because it contains aspirin. If you are concerned about your child's 
vomiting or diarrhea, contact his doctor. 
<h3>6. Antibiotics</h3>Many parents are concerned that their child's illness 
will only resolve after a round of antibiotics. However, this is usually not 
the case. Antibiotics will not cure or shorten the duration of a viral illness, 
such as the common cold or flu. Unfortunately, many antibiotics are often 
overprescribed because parents insist that they have one so their child will 
get better sooner. This problem has only led to drug-resistant bacteria and 
they still do not help a child with a viral illness. So if your child's doctor 
tells you that your child has a virus, don't push for an antibiotic; it won't 
help anyone.
