<h1>High Temperature &amp; Fever </h1> 
<p> High temperature or fever is a symptom that the body is fighting off an 
infection, and is easily checked with a medical thermometer. You can reduce the 
temperature by using medicines in thePain Relief Medicines For Adults section 
or thePain &amp; Temperature Relief For Children section, containing 
paracetamol or ibuprofen, or using aspirin for adults.</p> For More Information 
On High Temperature &amp; Fever See: <br>
 Sections:&nbsp; Medical Thermometers 
:Medicines For High Temperature &amp; Fever : High Temperature &amp; Fever In 
Children <br>

<p> <b>High temperature and fever </b>can be treated with medicines containing 
paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin (Adults and children over 16 years), which 
are listed in thePain Relief Medicines For Adults and Pain &amp; Temperature 
Relief For Children sections. </p> 
<p> <b> A high temperature or fever is one of the effects of infection on the 
body</b>. We all get this from time to time, and it should be watched 
carefully, especially in children. It is very important to treat it properly, 
and know when it is time to see your doctor for help.</p>

<p> <b> What is a high temperature?</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>37&ordm;C (98.6&ordm;F)</b> is normal body temperature</li> 
<li><b>38&ordm;C (100.4&ordm;F)</b> or over is regarded as a high temperature
</li> </ul> <b>Children under 3 months old</b> with a temperature of 38&ordm;C 
(100.4&ordm;F) or above should be referred to a doctor, as should children 3-6 
months with a temperature of 39&ordm;C (102.2&ordm;F) or above, as young 
children are particularly vulnerable to feverish illnesses.
<p> <b> How to take a temperature.</b> </p> 
<p> <b> It is important that if you take a temperature, that you do it the 
right way</b>. It is not always necessary to take someone&rsquo;s temperature, 
but it will tell you a lot more about how ill someone is, rather than by just 
feeling how hot they are. Ourmedical thermometers are safer than glass ones to 
use.</p> 
<p> <b>Different thermometers are suitable for different ages:</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Children under 4 weeks</b> old can use an electronic thermometer under 
the arm</li> 
<li><b>Children 4 weeks to 5 years</b> can use an electronic thermometer used 
under the arm or an infrared ear thermometer</li> 
<li><b>Children over 5 and adults</b> can use an electronic thermometer used 
under the tongue or&nbsp; an infrared ear thermometer</li> </ul> <b>A forehead 
thermometer</b> can be used at any age but is not as accurate. <br>

<p> <b>There are three things you can, and should do to calm-down a high 
temperature</b>:- </p> 
<p> <b>Do the simple things first. Drink plenty and keep cool</b> - </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Drink plenty of liquids (not alcohol). This is very important because when 
we have a high temperature there is more water lost as sweat, which must be 
replaced by drinking more. It is especially important not to become dehydrated.
</li> 
<li>Dress lightly. It is important to allow the body to loose this extra heat, 
and you will interfere with that if you wrap up too much. Keep the room at a 
comfortable temperature, without being too hot. Have some ventilation in the 
room, so it is not stuffy.</li> 
<li>Keep children calm. If they are bouncing around they will only warm up 
more. Keep them quiet. This also applies to adults and exercise.</li> 
<li>Use cooling products such as Children's Kool 'n' Soothe on the forehead
</li> </ul>

<p> <b>Use medicines properly</b> -<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Medicines to reduce temperature are important. Use the right medicine, at 
the right dose, and repeat the dose in the right way.</li> 
<li> Use your favourite brand correctly. Paracetamol is normally the first 
choice, but aspirin and ibuprofen can be used according to the directions, and 
are equally effective.</li> 
<li> Dangers of overdose. Too much of any medicine is dangerous, but this is 
especially important for paracetamol. The main thing to watch is that you 
remember, or write down the number of doses you take over 24 hours, and do not 
take more than the recommended dose. Also be very careful not to give two 
medicines together which both contain the same ingredient. Paracetamol is 
already in a lot of medicines, and you can double up on the dose without 
realising it. Read the ingredients very carefully if you ever use two medicines 
together. Even better, check with your pharmacist first.</li> 
<li> Danger of underdose. Many people are worried about taking too much 
medicine. While it very important to be careful not to give more than the 
recommended dose, it is equally important to take enough for it to work. As I 
often say to my customers &quot;If you don&rsquo;t take it, then it 
doesn&rsquo;t work!&quot;. Take the recommended dose. There are many times when 
customers have come to me, or gone to see their doctor, when a temperature has 
stayed high, and all they needed to do was to give the medicine properly in the 
first place.</li> </ul> <br>
