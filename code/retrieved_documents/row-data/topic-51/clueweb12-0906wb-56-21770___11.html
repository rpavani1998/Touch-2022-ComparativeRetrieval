Clinical thermometer showing a temperature of 38.7&deg;C 
(101.6&deg;F).<i>Source: Wikimedia Commons.</i> A <b>fever</b> is an elevated 
body temperature. It is defined in medicine as<b>&quot;a state of elevated core 
temperature, which is often, but not necessarily, part of the defensive 
responses of multicellular organisms (host) to the invasion of live 
microorganisms or inanimate matter recognized as pathogenic (something which 
causes illness) or alien by the host.&quot;</b> [1] In everyday usage, however, 
a fever is usually defined as a rise in body temperature above the normal 
range, usually by one or two &deg;C. What is considered the normal range in 
body temperature (typically<b>37&deg;C or 98.6&deg;F</b>) is open to debate. [2]
 Recently, scientists have defined the normal body temperature using a 
thermometer in the mouth as<b>37.2&deg;C</b> (98.9&deg;) in the morning and <b>
37.7&deg;C</b> (99.9&deg;F) overall in healthy adults aged 40 years or younger. 
[3] 
<p>A fever isn't an illness itself, but an indication that something out of 
the ordinary is going on in the body. A fever isn't necessarily bad. In fact, 
fevers seem to play a key role in helping the body fight off a number of 
infections.</p>

<h2> Other Names</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> Febrile illness </li> 
<li> Pyrexia </li> </ul> 
<h2> Causes</h2> 
<p>A fever occurs when the body temperature rises above its normal range. What 
is normal for one individual may be a little higher or lower than the average 
temperature of<b>98.6 &deg;F</b> (37 &deg;C). But a rectal temperature higher 
than<b>100.4 &deg;F</b> (38 &deg;C) is usually always considered a fever. A 
rectal temperature reading is generally 1 &deg;F higher than an oral reading.
</p> 
<p>Even when an individual is healthy, the body temperature varies throughout 
the day. It is lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and 
evening. The &quot;normal&quot; temperature taken by mouth can range from about
<b>97 &deg;F (36.1 &deg;C) to 99.9 &deg;F (37.7 &deg;C)</b>.[3] </p> 
<p>Normal body temperature is regulated by several areas in the brain and 
nervous system, including the hypothalamus, an area at the base of the brain 
that acts as a thermostat for the body.[2] In a healthy individual, anything 
that results in a rise in body temperature, for example exercising, causes the 
regulatory system to activate body mechanisms, such as sweating, to reduce the 
temperature back to normal. In a situation where fever occurs, substances in 
the body called<i>pyrogens</i>, discussed below, alter the activity of the 
regulatory system so that the body's temperature rises to a higher degree 
before cooling mechanisms are activated. Therefore a person with a fever will 
not sweat, even though body temperature is higher than normal, until a fever 
&quot;breaks&quot; (starts to resolve). When the temperature regulating system 
is exposed to pyrogens, the body increases heat production mainly by shivering. 
In newborns, non-shivering mechanisms are involved in increased heat production.
</p> 
<p>In many cases, the rise in body temperature that occurs with a fever can be 
viewed as a beneficial response in the body's attempt to fight off infecting 
microorganisms. Manybacteria thrive in an environment of around 98.6 &deg;F (37 
&deg;C), but don't reproduce as well at a higher temperature of only one or two 
degrees. Thus, the mechanisms of fever may have developed as an evolutionary 
response to infecting microbes.[4] </p> 
<h3> Pyrogens</h3> 
<p>Pyrogens are substances that can cause a fever. They can be produced by 
one's owncells (endogenous pyrogens) or can result from exposure to a 
microorganism (exogenous pyrogens). Endogenous pyrogens are chemicals produced 
by specific cells in the body, mainlymacrophages and other phagocytic cells 
(cells that engulf invading microbes), in response to an invading microbe or to 
exogenous pyrogens. Some endogenous pyrogens includeinterleukin-1, tumor 
necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and interferon gamma.[2] The mechanism by which 
endogenous pyrogens actually induce fever is not fully understood. The pathways 
appear to be complex and involve a number of other chemicals such as
prostaglandin E2.[2] </p> 
<p>Exogenous pyrogens are components of microorganisms that trigger an 
inflammatory response, which includes a fever.Endotoxin or LPS, a component of  
Gram negative bacteria, is a potent pyrogen. </p> 
<h3> Associated symptoms</h3> 
<p>Because a fever can occur with many different conditions, other signs and 
symptoms can often help identify the cause. Depending on what's causing the 
fever, additional fever symptoms may include:</p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li> Sweating </li> 
<li> Shivering </li> 
<li> Headache </li> 
<li> Muscle aches </li> 
<li> Lack of appetite </li> 
<li> Dehydration </li> 
<li> General weakness </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Very high fevers, from 103 &deg;F (39.4 &deg;C) to 106 &deg;F (41.1 &deg;C) 
and higher, may cause the following:</p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li> Hallucinations </li> 
<li> Confusion </li> 
<li> Irritability </li> 
<li> Convulsions </li> 
<li> Fever-induced seizures (febrile seizures). Febrile seizures are often 
triggered by a fever from a common childhood illness such asroseola, a viral 
infection that causes a high fever, swollen glands and a rash.</li> </ul> </dd> 
</dl> 
<p>A fever almost never rises above 105.8 &deg;F (41 &deg;C) to 107.6 &deg;F 
(42 &deg;C) in humans.[5] </p> 
<p>Fever can be a side effect of some medications such as antibiotics and 
drugs used to treathigh blood pressure or seizures. Some infants and children 
develop fevers after receivingroutine immunizations, such as the diphtheria, 
tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or [[pneumococcal]] vaccines. </p> 
<p>Sometimes it's not possible to identify the cause of a fever. If the body 
temperature is higher than 100.9 &deg;F (38.3 &deg;C) for more than three weeks 
and the doctor isn't able to find the cause after extensive evaluation, the 
diagnosis may befever of unknown origin.[6] [7] In most cases, though, the 
cause of the fever can be found and treated.</p> 
<h2> What a Fever Could Mean</h2> 
<p>A fever usually means the body is responding to a viral or bacterial 
infection. Sometimesheat exhaustion, extreme sunburn or certain inflammatory 
conditions such astemporal arteritis (inflammation of an artery in the head) 
may trigger fever as well. In rare instances, a malignanttumor or some forms of 
kidney cancer may cause a fever. </p> 
<h2> Treatment</h2> 
<p>Most fevers go away in a relatively short time (usually within a few days). 
Not all fevers need treatment with medications.[8] It's possible for fever 
medications to have side effects, especially in young children. Therefore, 
consultation with a physician may be necessary before administering fever 
medication to small children.</p> 
<p>The doctor will likely diagnose the cause of the fever based on other 
symptoms and a physical exam. Sometimes additional tests are necessary to 
confirm a diagnosis.</p> 
<p>If a low-grade fever persists for three weeks or more, without other 
symptoms, the doctor may recommend a variety of tests to help find the cause. 
These may includeblood tests and X-rays. </p> 
<p>Medical treatment depends on the cause of the fever. Antibiotics may be 
prescribed for bacterial infections, such aspneumonia or strep throat. For 
viral infections, including stomach infection (gastroenteritis) and 
mononucleosis, the best treatment is often rest and plenty of fluids. </p> 
<p>The doctor may also make a recommendation about using over-the-counter 
medications, such asacetaminophen (paracetamol, e.g. Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g.
Advil, Motrin) to lower a high fever. Adults may also use aspirin. However 
aspirin should not be used to treat a fever in children as it may trigger a 
rare, but potentially fatal, disorder known asReye syndrome. </p> 
<p>It is not advisable to try to lower the body temperature before consulting 
a physician (i.e. by taking a cold shower). Doing so may only prolong the 
illness or mask underlying symptoms and make it harder to determine the cause.
</p> 
<p>Some experts believe that aggressively treating a fever may actually 
interfere with the body's ability to fight an infection. That's because the 
viruses that cause colds and other respiratory infections thrive at cool 
temperatures. A slight fever can help the body get rid of such viruses.[4] </p> 
<h3> Self-care</h3> 
<p>Because the body loses more water with a fever, drink plenty of fluids to 
avoid dehydration. Water is a good choice for adults, but the best liquid for a 
sick child under one year of age is an oral rehydration solution (such as
Pedialyte). These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to 
replenish both fluids andelectrolytes in children. </p> 
<p>People with fever should get plenty of rest. Other recommendations for both 
older children and adults include the following:</p> 
<p><br>
<b>For fever below 102 &deg;F (38.9 &deg;C)</b> </p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Don't use any medication for a fever in this range unless advised by a 
doctor.</li> 
<li>Don't give children aspirin because of the risk of Reye syndrome. Instead, 
dress in comfortable, light clothing and try bathing in lukewarm water. At 
bedtime, use a sheet or light blanket.</li> </ul> </dd> </dl> 
<p><br>
<b>For fever between 102 &deg;F (38.9 &deg;C) and 104 &deg;F (40 
&deg;C)</b> </p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen according to the label instructions or as 
recommended by a doctor (adults may use aspirin instead).</li> 
<li>Acetaminophen is available in liquid, chewable, and suppository forms for 
children, but it's often easiest to give medications in liquid form. For a 
small child, use a syringe with measurements on the side and a bulb on the tip. 
Gently squirt the medicine in the back corners of the child's mouth.</li> 
<li>Avoid taking or administering too much medication. High doses of 
acetaminophen, or taking the drug for a long time, may cause liver or kidney 
damage, and an overdoses can be fatal. Side effects of aspirin and other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, include stomach pain, 
bleeding, and ulcers.</li> </ul> </dd> </dl> 
<p><br>
<b>For fever above 104 &deg;F (40 &deg;C)</b> </p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a five- to ten-minute sponge bath of lukewarm water to try to bring 
the high temperature down. A sponge bath is most likely to help if it's used 
shortly after a dosage of acetaminophen or ibuprofen is taken, so that the 
medication can work to keep the fever down after the bath takes effect.</li> 
</ul> </dd> </dl> 
<p>If a child shivers in the bath, stop the bath, dry the child and wait. 
Shivering actually raises the body's internal temperature (shaking muscles 
generate heat). If the fever doesn't get better or the child has a febrile 
seizure, seek immediate medical care.</p> 
<h3> When to seek medical attention</h3> 
<p>Fevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm&mdash;or a reason to call 
a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when medical advice should be 
obtained for infants, children, or adult as described below.</p> 
<h4> For Infants</h4> 
<p>An unexplained fever is a greater cause for concern in infants and children 
than in adults. Consult apediatrician (children's doctor) if the baby: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>is younger than three months of age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 
&deg;F (38 &deg;C) or higher.</li> 
<li>is older than three months of age and has a temperature of 102 &deg;F 
(38.8 &deg;C) or higher.</li> 
<li>has a fever and unexplained irritability, such as marked crying. </li> 
<li>has a fever and seems lethargic and unresponsive. In infants and children 
younger than two years of age, these may be signs ofmeningitis, an infection 
and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal 
cord.</li> 
<li>is a newborn and has a lower than normal temperature&mdash;less than 97 
&deg;F (36.1 &amp;degC). Very young babies may not regulate their body 
temperature well when they are ill and may become cold rather than hot.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4> For Children</h4> 
<p>Consult a pediatrician if the child: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>is listless or irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache or 
stomachache, or has any other symptoms causing significant discomfort.</li> 
<li>has a fever after being left in a very hot car. Seek medical care 
immediately.</li> 
<li>is younger than two years of age and has a fever that persists for longer 
than one day, or longer than three days in a child two years of age or older.
</li> 
<li>has special medical circumstances, such as immune system problems or a 
pre-existing illness.</li> </ul> 
<p>Sometimes, older children can have a lower-than-normal temperature. This 
can happen to older children with severe damage to thenervous system, children 
with a life-threatening bacterial infection in the blood (sepsis), and children 
with a weakened immune system.</p> 
<h4> For Adults</h4> 
<p>Consult a physician about a fever if: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>the body temperature is more than 103 &deg;F (39.4 &deg;C). </li> 
<li>the duration of the fever is more than three days. </li> </ul> 
<p>In addition, consult a physician immediately if any of these signs and 
symptoms accompany a fever:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Severe headache. </li> 
<li>Severe swelling of the throat. </li> 
<li>Unusual skin rash, especially if the rash gets rapidly worse. </li> 
<li>Unusual eye sensitivity to bright light. </li> 
<li>Stiff neck and pain when bending the head forward. </li> 
<li>Mental confusion. </li> 
<li>Persistent vomiting. </li> 
<li>Difficulty breathing or chest pain. </li> 
<li>Extreme listlessness or irritability. </li> 
<li>Abdominal pain or pain when urinating. </li> 
<li>Any other unexplained signs or symptoms. </li> </ul> 
<h3> Taking a Temperature</h3> 
<p>To check body temperature, several types of thermometers are available, 
including electronic thermometers and ear (tympanic) thermometers.</p> 
<p>Thermometers with digital readouts and those that take the temperature 
quickly from the ear canal are especially useful for young children and older 
adults. Because the contents of glassmercury thermometers harm both humans and 
the environment, they are no longer recommended.</p> 
<p>A temperature is normally taking by placing an oral thermometer in the 
mouth, or a rectal thermometer in the rectum, and leaving it in place for three 
to five minutes. The thermometer is then removed and the temperature read. Both 
types of thermometers should be cleaned after use with alcohol or soap and warm 
water.</p> 
<p>Although it's not the most accurate way to take a temperature, an oral 
thermometer may be used for an armpit (axillary) reading as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Place the thermometer in the armpit with arms crossed over the chest. </li>
<li>Wait four to five minutes. The axillary temperature is about 1 degree 
Fahrenheit lower than an oral temperature.</li> </ul> 
<p>Use a rectal thermometer for infants as follows: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Place a dab of petroleum jelly on the bulb of the thermometer. </li> 
<li>Lay the baby on his or her tummy. </li> 
<li>Carefully insert the bulb one-half inch to one inch into the baby's 
rectum. Hold the bulb and the baby still for three minutes.</li> </ul> 
<h2> Complications</h2> 
<p>A rapid rise or fall in temperature may cause a fever-induced seizure 
febrile seizure in children younger than age 5. Although alarming, the majority 
of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.</p> 
<p>If a seizure occurs: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lay the child on his or her side. </li> 
<li>Remove any sharp objects that are near the child </li> 
<li>Loosen tight clothing and hold the child to prevent injury </li> 
<li>Don't place anything in the child's mouth or try to stop the seizure </li> 
<li>Although most seizures stop on their own, call for emergency medical 
assistance if a seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes.</li> 
<li>Try to note which part of the child's body begins to shake first. This can 
help the doctor understand the cause of the seizure.</li> </ul> 
<h2> Prevention</h2> 
<p>The best way to prevent fevers is to reduce exposure to infectious 
diseases. One of the most effective ways to do that is also one of the 
simplest, frequent hand washing.</p> 
<p>Frequent washing of the hands, especially before eating, after using the 
toilet, after spending time in a crowded public place, or after petting 
animals, can minimize exposure to bacteria or viruses that can result in fever. 
Try not to touch the nose, mouth oreyes, these are the main way viral 
infections are transmitted.</p> 
<p>Wash the hands vigorously, covering both the front and back of each hand 
with soap, and rinsing thoroughly under running water. Carry hand-washing 
towelettes for times when access to soap and water is not available.</p>
