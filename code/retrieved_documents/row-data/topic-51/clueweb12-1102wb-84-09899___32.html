<p>Elsewhere I have exposed the attack on the cheap and effective aspirin as a 
way to pave the way for the sales of Plavix, Warfarin and other antithrombotic 
drugs.&nbsp; In addition to lower MI rate, aspirin also reduce risk for
Alzheimer&rsquo;s, cancer, and increase survival among cancer patient with 
stage I, II, &amp; !!!</p> 
<p>The appropriate dose of warfarin is difficult to establish because it can 
vary by a factor of 10 among patients, and the consequences of receiving an 
incorrect dose can be catastrophic. Clinical factors, demographic variables, 
and variations in two genes &mdash; CYP2C9 (full name: cytochrome P450, 
subfamily 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9) and VKORC1 (full name: vitamin K 
epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1) &mdash; contribute significantly to the 
variability among patients in dose requirements for warfarin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are an estimated annual 33,000 emergency hospitalizations per year 
from the taking of Warfarin.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Authors of a recently published study in <i>The New England Journal of 
Medicine (NEJM)</i> found that &ldquo;there were an estimated&nbsp;an estimated 
99,628 emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events in U.S. adults 65 
years of age or older each year from 2007 through 2009.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Nearly half of these hospitalizations were among adults 80 years of age or 
older. Almost two-thirds of these emergency hospitalizations were due to 
unintentional overdoses, either from drug doses that were too high or from 
drugs used at recommended doses in combination with other drugs that 
effectively increased the amount of the overdosed drug in&nbsp;the body.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that many adverse-reaction deaths occur at home, such as 
those seen with DARVON, wherein patients, especially older adults, were found 
dead from the drug&rsquo;s heart-toxic effects.&nbsp;Also, a large proportion 
of hospitalizations for adverse drug reactions do not occur through the 
emergency room, since many life-threatening reactions (such as liver toxicity, 
heart failure and other drug-induced diseases) may slowly worsen, leading to 
elective, not emergency, hospitalization.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p>The <i>NEJM </i>authors found that four drugs or drug classes were 
implicated alone or in combination in more than two-thirds of hospitalizations
for adverse drug reactions: warfarin (COUMADIN, JANTOVEN; 33.3 percent), 
insulins (13.9 percent), oral antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel [PLAVIX] 
or aspirin; 13.3 percent) and oral hypoglycemic (diabetes) agents (10.7 
percent).&nbsp; {The numbers for aspirin are really much lower, for if there is 
a bleeding episode, most doctors will blame it on aspirin, even when the 
patient is taking several other drugs.&nbsp; This is exactly what happened to 
my friend Danny Bronstein who was taking Warfarin, a tranquilizer at night, and 
an ADD medication during the dayj&mdash;jk.}&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; they stated, &ldquo;most of these emergency 
hospitalizations for recognized adverse drug events in older adults resulted 
from a few commonly used medications. Improved management of antithrombotic 
drugs [warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel] and antidiabetic drugs [especially 
insulin] has the potential to reduce hospitalizations for adverse drug events 
in older adults.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Of the 99,628 annual emergency hospitalizations, by far the largest 
category implicated waswarfarin, with an estimated annual 33,000 emergency 
hospitalizations.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Warfarin</b><br>
<i>(Family: blood-clotting inhibitors)</i> </p> 
<p><b>About warfarin</b> </p> 
<p>Warfarin reduces the blood&rsquo;s ability to clot (coagulate) and prevents 
blood clots from forming in the arteries and veins. It is prescribed to people 
who have a history of abnormal blood clots or who are at high risk of having 
abnormal clots.</p> 
<p>Warfarin is a drug of considerable benefit after heart-valve replacement 
and in the prevention of blood clots from a type of heart-rhythm disturbance 
known as atrial fibrillation. It also reduces the risk of death, recurrent 
heart attacks and stroke after a heart attack.</p> 
<p>Patients over 60 years of age should generally be taking less than the 
usual adult dose to lower the risk of heavy bleeding (hemorrhage). After a 
patient has taken warfarin for three months, a doctor should reevaluate the 
patient&rsquo;s need to continue taking it.</p> 
<p><b>Who should not use warfarin</b> </p> 
<p>Do not use warfarin if you have or have had eclampsia or preeclampsia; 
blood disorders; or severe, uncontrolled high blood pressure. You should not 
use warfarin if you have or have had recent surgery, an aneurysm or dissecting 
aorta, a threatened or incomplete abortion, confirmed or suspected 
cerebrovascular hemorrhage or active bleeding.</p> 
<p><b>Before you use warfarin</b> </p> 
<p>Tell your doctor about any other drugs you take (including aspirin, herbs, 
vitamins and other nonprescription products) and whether you have or have had:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>allergies to drugs </li> 
<li>heart problems (including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction or 
stroke)</li> 
<li>thromboembolism </li> 
<li>severe allergies </li> 
<li>ulcers or other lesions of the&nbsp;gastrointestinal tract, respiratory 
tract or urinary tract</li> 
<li>kidney or liver problems </li> 
<li>diverticulitis </li> 
<li>vasculitis </li> 
<li>infectious disease </li> 
<li>vitamin K deficiency </li> 
<li>alcohol dependence </li> 
<li>severe inflammation of blood&nbsp;vessels </li> 
<li>subacute bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart) </li> 
<li>diabetes </li> 
<li>recent injury </li> 
<li>childbirth </li> 
<li>spinal puncture </li> 
<li>a fall or blow to the body or head </li> 
<li>wounds from trauma, ulcers or surgery </li>

<li>an intrauterine device (IUD) </li> 
<li>heavy or unusual menstrual&nbsp;bleeding </li> 
<li>medical or dental surgery </li> 
<li>severe or continuing diarrhea </li> </ul> 
<p><b>How to take warfarin</b> </p> 
<p>It is very important that you take warfarin exactly on schedule, since 
failing to take this drug properly can cause serious adverse effects (see 
&ldquo;Side effects&rdquo; below). While taking warfarin, patients should be 
monitored with regular blood tests to ensure that the most effective dose of 
the drug is being taken.</p> 
<p>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but skip it if you 
don&rsquo;t remember until the next day. Do not take double doses. Keep a 
record of missed doses and give the list to your doctor at each visit.</p> 
<p>Do not share your medication with others. </p> 
<p>Take the drug at the same time(s) each day. </p> 
<p>Store at room temperature with lid on tightly. Do not store in the 
bathroom. Do not expose to heat, moisture or strong light. Keep out of reach of 
children.</p> 
<p><b>Side effects</b> </p> 
<p>Call your doctor immediately if you experience: abnormal bleeding; bloody, 
cloudy or dark urine; difficult or painful urination or sudden decrease in the 
amount of urine; dizziness or fainting; swelling of the ankles, feet or legs; 
unusual weight gain; blue or purple toes; chills, fever, sore throat or unusual 
tiredness; yellow eyes or skin; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea; skin rash, hives 
or itching; sores or white spots in mouth or throat; sores on skin; stomach 
cramps or pain; loss of appetite; nervousness; confusion; blurred vision; chest 
pain; or difficulty breathing.</p> 
<p>Call your doctor if these symptoms continue: bloated stomach or gas, cold 
intolerance, diarrhea, lossof appetite, nausea or vomiting,stomach cramps or 
pain.</p> 
<p><i>Skin necrosis.</i> Australia&rsquo;s Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory 
Committee (ADRAC) has received nine reports of death of skin tissue (skin 
necrosis) with warfarin use, of which three were fatal. In four cases, the 
onset occurred within seven days of commencing warfarin, but in three cases, 
the first symptoms occurred three to eight weeks after starting warfarin.</p> 
<p><i>Risk of tendinitis when used with fluoroquinolone antibiotics</i>. In 
2006, we petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to add a warning to 
the product label of all fluoroquinolone antibiotics to alert doctors to the 
risk of tendinitis, including a warning of the possibility of complete tendon 
rupture, which can occur when fluoroquinolones are used with warfarin. The 
class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics includes drugs such as ciprofloxacin 
(CIPRO). The onset of symptoms is sudden and has occurred as soon as 24 hours 
after starting treatment with a fluoroquinolone. Most people have recovered 
completely after one to two months.</p> 
<p><b>Signs of overdose</b> </p> 
<p>If you suspect an overdose (see the signs below), call (800) 222-1222 to 
contact your poison control center:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>bleeding gums when brushing teeth </li> 
<li>nosebleeds </li> 
<li>unexplained bruising </li> 
<li>unusually heavy bleeding from cuts or wounds </li> 
<li>unusually heavy or unexpected menstrual bleeding </li> 
<li>abdominal pain or swelling </li> 
<li>sudden light-headedness </li> 
<li>weakness </li> 
<li>loss of consciousness </li> 
<li>backaches </li> 
<li>blood in urine </li> 
<li>bloody or tarry stools </li> 
<li>constipation </li> 
<li>headache </li> 
<li>joint pain </li> 
<li>stiffness or swelling </li> 
<li>blood or material that looks like coffee grounds expelled when coughing or 
vomiting</li> 
<li>pinpoint red spots on skin </li> </ul> 
<p><b>Interactions&nbsp;</b> </p> 
<p>Warfarin can interact with nearly all drugs and some dietary supplements. 
Its anti-clotting action is very difficult to control when other drugs are 
added or subtracted, or when another drug&rsquo;s dose is changed. Another 
medication may either increase or decrease warfarin&rsquo;s action (see 
&ldquo;Warfarin: Interactions&rdquo; box below).&nbsp; </p> 
<p>If you are taking warfarin, you should notify your doctor before taking any 
product containing acetaminophen. Acetaminophen may interact with warfarin to 
increase the risk of bleeding, a risk that rises with increasing doses of 
acetaminophen.</p> 
<p>This risk has been found to increase tenfold in people taking 28 or more 
regular-strength acetaminophen tablets per week, or the equivalent of 18 or 
more extra-strength tablets per week, compared to those taking warfarin and no 
acetaminophen. A regular-strength acetaminophen tablet contains 325 milligrams 
(mg) of acetaminophen, and an extra-strength tablet contains 500 mg of the 
drug. Results published from a prospective randomized, parallel, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 45 patients found that acetaminophen (at a dose of 
2 or 3 grams a day, administered for 10 days) increased the anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin in stable patients.</p> 
<p>The U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has 
received seven reports suggesting an interaction between warfarin and the 
dietary supplement glucosamine, according to the MHRA and the U.K. Committee on 
Safety of Medicines. In those cases, patients who previously had a stable 
international normalized ratio (INR, which is a measurement of how properly 
one&rsquo;s blood clots) while receiving warfarin experienced an INR increase 
(potentially dangerous abnormal thinning of the blood) after they started 
receiving glucosamine supplements. ADRAC reported in February 2008 that it had 
received 10 reports of an increase in INR values associated with warfarin and 
glucosamine use.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>When using warfarin</b> </p> 
<p>Wear a medical identification bracelet or carry a card stating that you 
take warfarin.</p> 
<p>Be very careful doing activities that may cause cuts or bleeding (such as 
shaving or cooking).</p> 
<p>Consult with your doctor immediately if any signs of bleeding occur. </p> 
<p>Do not drink alcohol. Eat a normal, balanced diet. Do not change your diet 
or take nutritional supplements or vitamins without first checking with your 
doctor.</p> 
<p>If you plan to have any surgery, including dental, tell your doctor that 
you take this drug.</p> 
<p>Do not take any other drugs, including nonprescription products (aspirin, 
cold remedies, antacids, laxatives), or change the dose of drugs you are taking 
without consulting your doctor.</p> 
<p>Be sure to schedule regular doctor visits for blood tests. Ask your doctor 
which of these tests should be done periodically while you are taking this drug:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>prothrombin time, now measured by the INR (INR should be checked daily for 
the first week, weekly until a therapeutic level is achieved and then monthly)
</li> 
<li>complete blood count </li> 
<li>stool tests for possible blood loss </li> 
<li>urine tests for possible blood loss </li> </ul> 
<p><b>Pregnancy and breast-feeding warnings</b> </p> 
<p>You should not take warfarin while nursing. Warfarin should not be used if 
you are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant. Severe malformations 
have occurred in infants of mothers taking this drug.</p> 
<p><b>Regulatory actions surrounding warfarin</b> </p> 
<p><i>2006:</i> The FDA announced on Oct. 10 that it would require that an 
agency-approved Medication Guide, which provides information about drug safety, 
accompany all new and refill prescriptions for the blood thinner warfarin.<br>
 
Warfarin is one of a limited number of drugs for which the FDA requires an 
FDA-approved Medication Guide to be dispensed when the prescription is filled. 
An FDA advisory committee has unanimously recommended that all drugs be 
accompanied by such medication guides, but at present, less than 5 percent of 
drugs are. The other 95 percent of drugs are accompanied by unregulated, often 
dangerously incomplete, information leaflets not approved by the FDA.</p> 
<p><i>2010:</i> In January, the FDA issued information on the dosage and 
administration of warfarin. The advisory emphasized that the dose of warfarin 
must be individualized and that lab monitoring is necessary. The appropriate 
dose of warfarin is influenced by various factors, stated in the advisory, and 
not all of the factors leading to the variability in warfarin dose are known.
</p> 
<p><b>Clopidogrel</b><br>
<i>(Family: adenosine diphosphate blockers, 
blood-clotting inhibitors)</i> </p> 
<p><i>Limited Use:</i> offers limited benefit or benefits certain people or 
conditions</p> 
<p><b>About clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>Clopidogrel is approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of a new heart attack 
or stroke in patients with a history of a recent heart attack or stroke. The 
drug has also been approved by the FDA for a condition known as acute coronary 
syndrome in patients who may be treated with medicines, with a stent (a metal 
device placed in a coronary vessel to keep it open) or with bypass surgery to 
reduce the rate of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. Acute 
coronary syndrome consists of unstable chest pain (angina) and changes in the 
electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) that suggest a heart attack.</p> 
<p>Because the retail cost of clopidogrel is at least 100 times greater than 
the cost of aspirin and is no better than aspirin in preventing a second heart 
attack or stroke, its use should be limited to those who cannot take aspirin. 
The long-term use of clopidogrel in the management of patients with acute 
coronary syndromes is unclear. Long-term clopidogrel may be no better than 
aspirin.</p> 
<p><b>FDA Boxed Warning<br>
 CLOPIDOGREL</b><br>
 There is reduced 
effectiveness in patients who are poor metabolizers of PLAVIX. Poor 
metabolizers do not effectively convert PLAVIX to its active form in the body.
</p> 
<p>Inform health care professionals that tests are available to identify 
genetic differences in CYP2C19 function.</p> 
<p>Advise health care professionals to consider use of other anti-platelet 
medications or alternative dosing strategies for PLAVIX in patients identified 
as poor&nbsp;metabolizers.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Who should not use clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>Do not use if you have or have had an intracranial hemorrhage or a peptic 
ulcer.</p> 
<p><b>Before you use clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>Tell your doctor if you have or have had an allergy to this drug, bleeding 
problems, liver disease, stomach ulcers, recent surgery or trauma. Also tell 
your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding and if you are taking any 
other drugs, including aspirin, herbs, vitamins and other nonprescription 
products.</p> 
<p><b>How to take clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but skip it if it is 
almost time for the next dose. Do not take double doses.</p> 
<p>Do not share your medication with others. </p> 
<p>Take the drug at the same time(s) each day. </p> 
<p>Store at room temperature with the lid on tightly. Do not store in the 
bathroom. Do not expose to heat, moisture or strong light. Keep out of reach of 
children.</p> 
<p><b>Side effects</b> </p> 
<p>Call your doctor immediately if you experience: black, tarry stools; blood 
in urine or stools; chest pain; coughing; fainting; fever, chills, sneezing or 
sore throat; frequent, painful or difficult urination; generalized pain; sudden 
or severe headaches; irregular heartbeat; joint pain; nosebleeds; red or purple 
spots on the skin; runny nose; shortness of breath; skin blistering, flaking or 
peeling; severe stomach pain; swelling of the feet or lower legs; ulcers, sores 
or white spots in the mouth; unusual bleeding or bruising; vomiting of blood or 
material that looks like coffee grounds; or sudden weakness.</p> 
<p>Call your doctor if these symptoms continue: abdominal or stomach pain, 
anxiety, back pain, constipation, diarrhea, depression, dizziness, fever, 
chills, headache, heartburn, insomnia, itching, joint pain, leg cramps, muscle 
aches, nausea or vomiting, numbness or tingling or skin rash.</p> 
<p><i>Clopidogrel and the blood disorder thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
(TTP)</i>. TTP is a life-threatening adverse effect that is characterized by a 
breakdown of red blood cells, low levels of cells that help stop bleeding 
(platelets), fever, mental changes and kidney problems. Clopidogrel and 
ticlopidine (TICLID), a close chemical relative of clopidogrel, have been 
linked to TTP. In the two-year period between March 1998 and March 2000, TTP 
was identified in 11 patients from an active surveillance program that involved 
blood banks around the U.S. Between the end of 1997 and the fourth quarter of 
2001, the FDA received 16 reports of TTP. (It is not known if these 16 reports 
included the 11 previously mentioned.)</p> 
<p><b>Clopidogrel in research studies</b> </p> 
<p><i>Cardiovascular events. </i>Researchers have struggled to show that 
clopidogrel is better than aspirin in preventing certain cardiovascular 
incidents such as heart attack and stroke, and they have been largely 
unsuccessful in doing this.</p> 
<p>A single clinical trial was the basis for the FDA approval of clopidogrel 
for preventing a second heart attack or stroke. In this trial, clopidogrel was 
directly compared to aspirin. The difference between clopidogrel and aspirin 
was very small but statistically significant, favoring clopidogrel. A critique 
of the trial concluded by saying that the result &ldquo;leaves open questions 
about whether such a difference is clinically meaningful or, in fact, 
reproducible.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The trial did not show clopidogrel to be superior to aspirin in preventing 
a second heart attack or stroke. The fact that clopidogrel is no better than 
aspirin in preventing a second heart attack or stroke did not stop its 
manufacturer from advertising it as a better drug overall. This resulted in the 
FDA warning Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi in April 2001 about its false and 
misleading promotion of clopidogrel as being superior to aspirin.</p> 
<p>In the August 1999 issue of the journal<i> Stroke</i>, researchers compared 
the benefits of clopidogrel to aspirin in reducing stroke, heart attack and 
death from diseases of the blood vessels, concluding that these two drugs work 
in different ways to prevent platelet aggregation, and currently there is no 
evidence that one way is better than the other.</p> 
<p>Also, an <i>NEJM </i>study published on April 20, 2006, found that 
clopidogrel, when given in combination with aspirin, was overall no more 
effective than aspirin alone in reducing the rate of heart attacks, strokes or 
deaths from cardiovascular causes.</p> 
<p>In a study examining the management of acute coronary syndromes, 
clopidogrel was found to be marginally better than aspirin by only 2.1 percent. 
However, in statistically significant results, there were more patients with 
major bleeding episodes (defined as needing a transfusion of at least two units 
of blood) in those taking clopidogrel. In this study, 1 percent more patients 
taking clopidogrel had a major bleeding episode compared to the aspirin-treated 
patients, but there was no statistically significant difference between those 
taking clopidogrel or aspirin inregard to episodes of life-threatening bleeding.
</p> 
<p>A further analysis of the trial mentioned immediately above found that in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome who were taking aspirin, adding 
clopidogrel was beneficial, compared to a placebo, in reducing major 
cardiovascular events. However, it has been noted that beyond 30 days, there 
was no significant advantage to treatment with clopidogrel over a placebo in 
regard to cardiovascular death or nonfatal heart attack.</p> 
<p><i>Effect decreased when combined with omeprazole (PRILOSEC)</i>. A study 
published in 2008, investigating the effect of the heartburn drug omeprazole (a 
proton pump inhibitor [PPI]) on the action of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy, 
found that omeprazole significantly decreased the effect of clopidogrel, 
meaning that clopidogrel could then be less effective in preventing strokes and 
heart attacks. Physicians should be aware of this association, since this drug 
combination is widely prescribed. Patients also should be made aware of this 
drug interaction, since omeprazole is available over the counter without a 
prescription.</p> 
<p>In 2009, the FDA issued information concerning the use of clopidogrel and 
omeprazole. According to the FDA release, the concurrent use of clopidogrel and 
omeprazole resulted in a reduction in the effectiveness of clopidogrel. The FDA 
release also stated that separating the administration time of the dose of each 
drug did not reduce the harmful interaction of this therapy.</p> 
<p>According to the FDA, &ldquo;Other drugs that are expected to have a 
similar effect and should be avoided in combination with clopidogrel include: 
cimetidine, fluconazole,<br>
 ketoconazole, voriconazole, etravirine, 
felbamate, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and ticlopidine.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><i>Genetic factors</i>. Published medical literature shows that clopidogrel 
is less effective in some patients than it is in others. This may be due to 
genetic factors that influence how the body metabolizes clopidogrel or the 
effect that certain other drugs (such as PPIs) have on the effectiveness of 
clopidogrel. The FDA is working with the manufacturer to obtain more 
information on this.</p> 
<p><i>Bleeding ulcers</i>. Research published in the Jan. 20, 2005, <i>NEJM 
</i>found &ldquo;an astonishingly high rate of bleeding ulcers&rdquo; in 
patients taking clopidogrel compared to patients taking aspirin plus the 
antiulcer/heartburn drug esomeprazole (NEXIUM). No safety advantage was found 
for clopidogrel over aspirin plus esomeprazole in ulcer bleeding.</p> 
<p><b>When using clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>Do not exceed the prescribed dose.<br>
 Tell any doctor, dentist, emergency 
medical technician, pharmacist or surgeon whose care you are under that you 
take clopidogrel. This is especially important for any surgery, including 
dental.</p> 
<p><b>Pregnancy and breast-feeding warnings</b> </p> 
<p>You should not take clopidogrel while nursing. Clopidogrel should not be 
used if you are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant. Severe 
malformations have occurred in infants of mothers taking this drug.</p> 
<p><b>CLOPIDOGREL: INTERACTIONS</b> </p> 
<p>The following drugs, biologics (e.g., vaccines, therapeutic antibodies) and 
foods are listed in Evaluations of Drug Interactions 2003 as causing 
&ldquo;highly clinically significant&rdquo; or &ldquo;clinically 
significant&rdquo; interactions when used together with any of the drugs in 
clopidogrel&rsquo;s class. In some classes with multiple drugs, the interaction 
may have been reported for one but not all drugs in the class, but we include 
the interaction because the drugs in this class are similar to one another. We 
also have included potentially serious interactions listed in the drug&rsquo;s 
FDA-approved product label or in published medical journal articles. There may 
be other drugs, especially those in the families of the drugs listed below, 
that also will react with this drug to cause severe adverse effects. Make sure 
to tell your doctor and pharmacist the drugs you are taking and whether you 
take any of these interacting drugs:</p>

<p><b>Regulatory actions surrounding clopidogrel</b> </p> 
<p>In response to an action letter request by the FDA, the manufacturer of 
clopidogrel revised the &ldquo;Precautions&rdquo; section of the product label 
to include the following statement: &ldquo;In patients with recent TIA 
[transient ischemic attack] or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent 
ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and PLAVIX has not been shown to be 
more effective than PLAVIX alone, but the combination has been shown to 
increase major bleeding.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><i>2010</i>: In March, the FDA issued an advisory that a boxed warning has 
been added to the product information for clopidogrel (see &quot;Clopidogrel

<p>Warfarin is an acronym derived from the name of the patent holder Wisconsin 
Alumni Research Foundation.&nbsp; Following the report of hemorrhagic disorder 
in cattle, the cause was found to be spoiled sweet clover silage, and the 
hemorrhagic agent was identified in 1939.&nbsp; In 1948 a more potent synthetic 
congener was synthetiaed and marketed as a very effective rodenticide. Goodman 
&amp; Gilman 11th edition 2006, p. 1475</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>The list of drugs and other factors that may affect the action of warfarin 
and related anticoagulants is prodigious and expanding.&nbsp; Warfarin acts as 
an antagonist of vitamin K. (G&amp;G 1477) Bleeding is the major toxicity of 
orgal anticoagulant drugs. Especially serious episodes involve sites where 
irreversible damage mayu result from compression of vital structures (e.g., 
intracranial, pericardial, verve sheath, or spinal cord).&nbsp; Although the 
reported incidence of major bleeding episodes varies considerably, it is 
generally less than 5% per year in patients treated with a target INR of 2 to 
3.&nbsp; The risk of intracranial hemorrhage increases dramatically with an INR 
greater than 3, especially in older patients. G&amp;G 1478 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>Oral anticoagulants are used to prevent the progression or recurrence of 
acute dep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following an initial course of 
herparin [Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan found in the secretory granules of 
mast cells.&nbsp; Heparin increases the rate of the thrombin-antithrombin 
reaction at least a thousand fold.&nbsp; It is used to initiate treatment of 
venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism because of its rapid onset of 
action.&nbsp; G&amp;G 1471-72]&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drug Interactions: Warfarin (COUMADIN) </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worst Pills Best Pills Newsletter article

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These days, prescription drugs often become popular after drug companies 
inundate health professionals and the public with advertising (especially on 
television).</p> 
<p>But after the initial hype, some of these drugs are doomed to extinction 
due to toxicity &ndash; sometimes unanticipated, and sometimes known but hidden 
or downplayed by those with a vested interest. Other drugs languish over time, 
and still others are superceded by newer drugs that are more effective and/or 
less toxic.</p> 
<p>But occasionally a drug has staying power and continues to be used over the 
decades.&nbsp;Warfarin (COUMADIN)&nbsp;is such a drug. It debuted on the U.S. 
market in 1954, and last year about 24 million prescriptions were filled in 
U.S. pharmacies for this important drug.</p> 
<p>What is warfarin used for?<br>
 Warfarin has been used as an anticoagulant 
(&ldquo;blood thinner&rdquo;) to reduce the chances of blood clots in high-risk 
individuals. If blood clots form, they can break off from inside the blood 
vessel in which they formed and travel throughout the body, sometimes blocking 
blood flow within vital organs such as the lungs and brain.</p> 
<p>Who uses warfarin?<br>
 The drug is commonly used in patients with a 
tendency to form blood clots in their legs (deep venous thrombosis). If these 
clots travel to the lungs, they can cause what is known as a pulmonary 
embolism, which is frequently fatal.</p> 
<p>Warfarin is also used in patients with abnormal heart rhythms such as 
atrial fibrillation, which can cause clots to form in the heart and then travel 
to the brain, resulting in a stroke.</p> 
<p>In addition, the drug is used to prevent second heart attacks in some 
patients who have already had one, to prevent clots in patients with artificial 
heart valves and to treat a number of other blood clotting problems.</p> 
<p>What side effects does warfarin have?<br>
 Although warfarin has saved many 
lives, its one big drawback is that, by reducing blood clotting, it increases 
the risk of bleeding. Often the bleeding is easy to find, such as in the urine, 
stool or skin, and it serves as an early warning sign to the patient to have 
his or her blood checked for excessive &ldquo;thinning.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sometimes, however, the bleeding is serious or life-threatening but can be 
difficult to detect, such as bleeding from the stomach or bleeding into the 
brain, especially when there is a smaller amount of bleeding that does not 
cause symptoms. Keep in mind that serious bleeding is uncommon, and as long as 
clotting has not been slowed too much, the benefit of warfarin for 
well-established indications often outweighs the risks.</p> 
<p>How can the risk of bleeding be minimized?<br>
 Although the risk of 
bleeding in people taking warfarin cannot be completely reduced, even with 
optimal management, patients taking the drug are less likely to have bleeding 
problems if they follow dosage directions very carefully, and have their blood 
tested to measure the degree of clotting inhibition exactly as they have been 
advised.</p> 
<p>Minimizing the risk of warfarin-induced bleeding, however, also requires 
that patients pay close attention to drug interactions because some of these 
can raise the International Normalized Ratio (INR; see&nbsp;Box) into a range 
that is too high, with an unnecessarily increased risk of bleeding. Other 
interactions may lower the INR below the desired range and thereby put the 
patient at risk of clotting.</p> 
<p>The International Normalized Ratio (INR) is a test applied to a sample of a 
patient&rsquo;s blood to determine how &ldquo;thin&rdquo; it is. The normal 
value in people not using warfarin ranges from 0.8 to 1.2. Higher numbers 
indicate thinner blood, so the number increases with warfarin use.<br>
<br>
 
Therefore, the likelihood that dangerous clotting will occur decreases with 
these higher numbers.<br>
<br>
 For most patients who use warfarin, the desired 
INR range is between 2 and 3. Their dose of the drug will be adjusted until 
their test result is somewhere in that range. An INR higher than that may 
increase the chance of bleeding, and a ratio lower than that may not protect 
patients from the clotting for which they are using the drug.</p> 
<p>The first step in avoiding bad interactions between warfarin and other 
drugs is never to start, stop or change the dosage of any prescription, 
non-prescription or alternative medication without informing the health 
professional who is managing your warfarin treatment. Many patients are 
prescribed drugs by several different health care professionals: general 
physicians, specialists, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants 
and others. The only way a patient can be sure that the person managing their 
warfarin therapy will know all of his or her medications (prescription or not) 
is if the patient provides an up-to-date list of all of these drugs and/or 
dietary supplements.</p> 
<p>Is bleeding the only risk with warfarin drug interactions?<br>
 No. Some 
drugs interfere with the blood-thinning effects of warfarin, cause the INR to 
decrease and may actually increase the risk of having a clot. This can be just 
as dangerous as drug interactions that increase bleeding risk.</p> 
<p>Can over-the-counter (OTC) medications interact with warfarin?<br>
 
Absolutely. In fact, one of the most common serious warfarin drug interactions 
occurs when people on warfarin take common OTC painkillers such as&nbsp;aspirin
,&nbsp;ibuprofen (ADVIL, MEDIPREN, MOTRIN, NUPRIN), or&nbsp;naproxen (ALEVE, 
ANAPROX, NAPROSYN). Combining warfarin with these painkillers increases the 
risk of serious stomach bleeding. While doctors sometimes use warfarin and 
aspirin together for additive blood thinning, it should only be done after 
careful consideration of the benefit versus risk balance, because the risk is 
clearly increased.</p> 
<p>The take-home message is not to take any OTC medication &ndash; and 
especially any painkiller &ndash; without checking first with the person who is 
managing your warfarin therapy.</p> 
<p>Can &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicines interact with warfarin?<br>
 Yes. 
Some complementary and alternative medications (CAMs) have been shown to 
interact with warfarin. For some dietary supplements (such as&nbsp;ginkgo) the 
risk of bleeding may be increased, while other dietary supplements (such 
as&nbsp;St. John&rsquo;s Wort) may inhibit the blood thinning effect of 
warfarin and increase the risk of clotting. (See&nbsp;Table 1&nbsp;for some 
dietary supplements that may interact with warfarin.)</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that dietary supplements are generally not standardized, so 
different brands may interact differently because the amount of active 
ingredient (and in some cases &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; ingredients) may not be 
the same. Moreover, even different lots of the same brand may vary 
substantially as to content.</p> 
<p>In short, patients on warfarin are rarely, if ever, justified in taking 
dietary supplements. (The same can be said for patients not taking warfarin, 
but that is a different story.)</p> 
<p>Which prescription medications interact with warfarin?<br>
 Unfortunately, 
there is a very long list of prescription meds that interact with warfarin (See 
Tables&nbsp;2&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;3). Part of the problem is that there are several 
ways that medications can interact with this drug. The most common is when 
another medication throws a monkey wrench into the body&rsquo;s normal 
machinery for getting rid of warfarin from the body (see&nbsp;Table 2). Unless 
the blood is tested and the warfarin dose is adjusted accordingly, warfarin 
will accumulate, the blood will become too thin and bleeding may result. A good 
example is the commonly used antibiotic with the unwieldy name,&nbsp;
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM, COTRIM, SEPTRA); it can 
dramatically increase the blood-thinning effects of warfarin and increase 
bleeding risk.</p> 
<p>Other medications can have the opposite effect from the monkey wrench, and 
ramp up the warfarin-gobbling machinery into &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; mode. This 
means that warfarin is being destroyed too fast so warfarin levels are reduced, 
the patient&rsquo;s INR goes below the desired range, and the patient is more 
at risk of having a serious blood clot. Examples of drugs that can do this are 
found in&nbsp;Table 3. </p> 
<p>Proper clotting involves both the production of chemicals called clotting 
factors (it is this process that warfarin inhibits) and the activity of small 
particles suspended in the blood called platelets. Some medications can 
interfere with the function of the blood&rsquo;s platelets. Platelets normally 
help prevent bleeding by sticking together and plugging up leaks in blood 
vessels. When a patient&rsquo;s blood has already been thinned by warfarin, the 
platelet&rsquo;s job becomes even more important. A recent study confirmed that 
antiplatelet medications such as aspirin or NSAIDs caused a substantial 
increase in serious stomach bleeding in people taking warfarin.</p> 
<p>Still other drugs can also affect the ability of the liver to manufacture 
these clotting factors. Thus these other drugs may join with warfarin to gang 
up on the liver to further suppress the production of these important clotting 
chemicals. If the blood becomes too thin, the patient may bleed. It is likely 
that thyroid replacement hormones act in this way. The thyroid-warfarin 
interaction is one of the most common of all drug interactions, and it is 
important to note that the risk of this interaction occurs primarily when 
thyroid medication is started, stopped or its dosage is adjusted. A person on 
stable doses of warfarin and thyroid replacement medication is not likely to 
have problems from the interaction.</p> 
<p>What You Can Do&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 Make sure the person managing your 
warfarin therapy is fully aware of all of the medications you are taking, 
including prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements.
</p> 
<p>Note that the drugs listed in Tables&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2&nbsp;and&nbsp;3
&nbsp;represent most of the established and important drug interactions 
involving warfarin. But due to the rapidly changing nature of medical 
knowledge, new warfarin drug interactions are regularly discovered. So be sure 
to consult with your health professional if you have any questions regarding 
interactions of warfarin with any other medications.</p>

<p>New England Journal of Medicine: </p>

<p>Warfarin Dosing<br>
 The appropriate dose of warfarin is difficult to 
establish because it can vary by a factor of 10 among patients, and the 
consequences of receiving an incorrect dose can be catastrophic. Clinical 
factors, demographic variables, and variations in two genes &mdash; CYP2C9 
(full name: cytochrome P450, subfamily 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9) and 
VKORC1 (full name: vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1) &mdash; 
contribute significantly to the variability among patients in dose requirements 
for warfarin. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration added pharmacogenetic 
information to the warfarin product label but did not propose a specific method 
for using genetic information to predict the dose required for individual 
patients.*</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>ABSTRACT </p> 
<p>Background Genetic variability among patients plays an important role in 
determining the dose of warfarin that should be used when oral anticoagulation 
is initiated, but practical methods of using genetic information have not been 
evaluated in a diverse and large population. We developed and used an algorithm 
for estimating the appropriate warfarin dose that is based on both clinical and 
genetic data from a broad population base.</p> 
<p>Methods Clinical and genetic data from 4043 patients were used to create a 
dose algorithm that was based on clinical variables only and an algorithm in 
which genetic information was added to the clinical variables. In a validation 
cohort of 1009 subjects, we evaluated the potential clinical value of each 
algorithm by calculating the percentage of patients whose predicted dose of 
warfarin was within 20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose; we also 
evaluated other clinically relevant indicators.</p> 
<p>Results In the validation cohort, the pharmacogenetic algorithm accurately 
identified larger proportions of patients who required 21 mg of warfarin or 
less per week and of those who required 49 mg or more per week to achieve the 
target international normalized ratio than did the clinical algorithm (49.4% 
vs. 33.3%, P&lt;0.001, among patients requiring 21 mg per week; and 24.8% vs. 
7.2%, P&lt;0.001, among those requiring 49 mg per week). </p> 
<p>Conclusions The use of a pharmacogenetic algorithm for estimating the 
appropriate initial dose of warfarin produces recommendations that are 
significantly closer to the required stable therapeutic dose than those derived 
from a clinical algorithm or a fixed-dose approach. The greatest benefits were 
observed in the 46.2% of the population that required 21 mg or less of warfarin 
per week or 49 mg or more per week for therapeutic anticoagulation.</p>
