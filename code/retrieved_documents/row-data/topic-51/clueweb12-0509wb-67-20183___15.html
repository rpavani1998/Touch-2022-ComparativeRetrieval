<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper 
airways. It can cause nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, sneezing, a sore throat 
and a cough. Usually it's a self-limiting infection &ndash;&nbsp;this means it 
gets better by itself without the need for treatment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More than 200 different viruses can cause the common cold, which is why 
people will become infected again at a later stage. Read more about thecauses 
of cold.</p> 
<p>Adults have about two to four colds a year, and children have three to 
eight. A child&rsquo;s immune system is less well developed compared to an 
adult&rsquo;s, so they're more vulnerable to infection.</p> 
<p>Women get more colds than men, possibly because they're more likely to come 
into close contact with children.</p> 
<p><b>How a cold spreads&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>A&nbsp;cold can be spread through:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>direct contact &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>for example, if you sneeze or 
cough, tiny droplets of fluid containing the cold virus are launched into the 
air and can be breathed in by others</li> 
<li><strong>indirect contact &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>for example, if you sneeze 
onto a door handle and someone else touches the handle a few minutes later, 
they may catch the cold virus if they then touch their mouth or nose&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In general, a person first becomes contagious two to three days before 
their symptoms begin, and they remain contagious until all their symptoms 
have&nbsp;gone. So most people will be contagious for around two weeks.</p> 
<p><b>Why colds occur in the winter</b></p> 
<p>Colds are more frequent during the winter months. This may be because 
people are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with each other. 
However, higher rates of colds haven't been found in passengers on the London 
Underground even though they spend a lot of time in close contact with each 
other.</p> 
<p>Research carried out in 2005 suggests that cold weather could make people 
more vulnerable to developing a cold. However, further research is required to 
confirm this.</p> 
<p><b>Outlook</b></p> 
<p>In adults and older children, the cold will usually last for about a week. 
You can relieve the symptoms of the cold while the body fights off the 
infection by taking over-the-counter medication, such as paracetamol, and 
drinking plenty of fluids.</p> 
<p>Read the treating colds&nbsp;section for more information.</p> ^^ Back to 
top <br>

<h2>Symptoms</h2> 
<p>The first symptom of a cold is usually a sore or irritated throat. This is 
then followed by other symptoms, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a blocked nose (nasal congestion)</li> 
<li>nasal pain and irritation&nbsp;</li> 
<li>sneezing&nbsp;</li> 
<li>a runny nose (nasal discharge) &ndash;&nbsp;the discharge is usually clear 
and runny at first before becoming thicker and darker over the course of the 
infection&nbsp;</li> 
<li>coughing &ndash;&nbsp;this symptom occurs in one out of every three 
cases&nbsp;</li> 
<li>a hoarse voice&nbsp;</li> 
<li>a general sense of feeling unwell</li> </ul> 
<p>Less common symptoms of a cold include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a usually mild temperature (fever)&nbsp;of around 38&ndash;39&deg;C 
(100.4&ndash;102.2&deg;F)&nbsp;</li> 
<li>headache&nbsp;</li> 
<li>muscle pain&nbsp;</li> 
<li>loss of taste and smell&nbsp;</li> 
<li>mild irritation of your eyes&nbsp;</li> 
<li>a feeling of pressure in your ears and face&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p>The symptoms of a cold are usually at their worst during the first two to 
three days of the infection before they gradually start to improve. In adults 
and older children, the cold usually lasts for about a week. However, if you or 
your child has a cough, it may last for up to three weeks.</p> 
<p>Colds tend to last longer in younger children who are under five. Their 
symptoms typically last between 10&ndash;14 days.</p> ^^ Back to top <br>

<h2>Causes</h2> 
<p>Colds are caused by viruses. More than 200 types of virus can cause a cold. 
Those&nbsp;most&nbsp;responsible for colds belong to one of two groups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>rhinoviruses</li> 
<li>coronaviruses</li> </ul> 
<p>Because a number of viruses can cause a cold, it's possible to have several 
colds, one after the other, as each one is caused by a different virus.</p> 
<p><b>What do colds do to the body?</b></p> 
<p>The viruses that cause a cold attack the lining of the nose and throat, 
inflaming these areas. As they become inflamed, they begin to produce more 
mucus, resulting in a runny nose and sneezing.</p> 
<p><b>How is a cold spread?</b></p> 
<p>Colds can be spread in several ways. If you have a cold and you sneeze, 
cough or speak, tiny droplets of fluid containing the cold virus are launched 
into the air. If these are breathed in by someone else then they may become 
infected.</p> 
<p>Colds can also spread through direct and indirect contact. If you have a 
cold and you touch your nose or eyes and then touch someone else, you may pass 
the virus on to them. Alternatively, if you touch an object such as a door 
handle or telephone, the virus may be transferred to the object. If someone 
touches the object a short time later and then touches their mouth, nose or 
eyes, they may become infected.</p> ^^ Back to top <br>

<h2>Diagnosis</h2> 
<p>In most cases, you will know when you have a cold from the symptoms.</p> 
<p><b>When to seek medical advice</b></p> 
<p>A visit to your GP is usually only necessary if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>your symptoms persist for more than 14 days</li> 
<li>you have a high temperature (fever) of or above 39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F)</li>
<li>you cough up blood-stained phlegm (thick mucus)</li> 
<li>you feel chest pain</li> 
<li>you have breathing difficulties</li> 
<li>you experience severe swelling of your lymph nodes (glands) in your neck 
and/or armpits</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>If you're concerned about your baby or an elderly person, or you 
have a long-term illness, such as a chest condition, arrange to see your GP. 
Alternatively, you can&nbsp;phone NHS Direct on 0845 4647, for an assessment.
</strong></p> 
<p>In these circumstances your GP may carry out tests to make sure that your 
symptoms aren't being caused by another type of infection that&nbsp;may be more 
serious, such aspneumonia (a bacterial infection of the lungs) or glandular 
fever (a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus).</p> 
<p>These tests may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>blood tests</li> 
<li>chest X-rays</li> 
<li>taking a sample of tissue from your throat using a swab (a small cotton 
bud with a plastic loop at the end), which is then checked for the presence of 
bacteria</li> </ul> ^^ Back to top <br>

<h2>Treatment</h2> 
<p><b>Self care </b></p> 
<p>In most cases, you will be able to treat the symptoms of cold yourself at 
home by using a number of self-care techniques. These are listed below.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Drink plenty of fluids to replace any fluids you may have lost due to 
sweating and having a runny nose.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Get plenty of rest: there's no official guidance as to how long a person 
should stay off work or out of school. Most people usually know when they're 
fit enough to return to normal activities.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Eat healthily: a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty 
of fresh fruit and vegetables (five portions a day).</li> </ul> 
<p>Many children will lose their appetite when they have a cold. However, this 
is perfectly normal and it should only last for a few days. It's recommended 
that children with a cold only eat when they're hungry.</p> 
<p>The remedies&nbsp;outlined below may also help to relieve your symptoms.</p>
<p><b>Steam inhalation </b></p> 
<p>Steam inhalation involves sitting with your head over a bowl of hot water. 
Place a towel over your head, close your eyes and breathe deeply. Avoid getting 
the hot steam in your eyes.</p> 
<p>The steam may help to ease your congestion by loosening mucus and making it 
easier to clear by blowing your nose. Adding menthol, eucalyptus, camphor, 
thymol or pine oil to the water may help to clear the passageways in your 
nose.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Steam inhalation is not advised for children due to the risk of scalding. 
Instead, a child may benefit from sitting in a hot, steamy bathroom.</p> 
<p><b>Gargling</b></p> 
<p>Gargling with salt water can sometimes help to relieve the symptoms of a 
sore throat and nasal congestion.</p> 
<p><b>Vapour rubs</b></p> 
<p>Vapour rubs can help to soothe the symptoms of a cold in babies and young 
children. Apply the rub to your child&rsquo;s chest and back. Don't apply it to 
their nostrils because this could cause pain and breathing difficulties.</p> 
<p><b>Menthol sweets</b></p> 
<p>Some people find that sucking a menthol sweet can help to relieve the 
symptom of a sore throat.</p> 
<p><b>Nasal saline drops</b></p> 
<p>Nasal saline drops or sprays can help relieve the symptoms of nasal 
congestion in babies and young children. Nasal saline drops contain salt water 
so they're thought to work in the same way as gargling salt, but they're often 
better tolerated in babies and young children.</p> 
<p>Nasal saline drops or sprays are available from most pharmacists.</p> 
<p><b>Over-the-counter cold medications</b></p> 
<p>In England, over-the-counter (OTC) cold medicines are probably the most 
widely used type of medication. However, there isn&rsquo;t much evidence that 
certain OTC medications are effective.</p> 
<p>Painkillers such as ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin are the only type of 
medication known to be effective in treating colds.</p> 
<p><strong>Children who are under 16 years old or women who are breastfeeding 
should not take aspirin.</strong></p> 
<p>Decongestants (medications designed to reduce nasal congestion) may have 
some limited effectiveness against colds. However, don't use them for more than 
five to seven days because overuse can make the symptoms of congestion worse.
</p> 
<p>There's no evidence to support the use of antihistamines or cough syrups in 
treating a cold.</p> 
<p>The use of antibiotics to treat a cold is not recommended. As almost all 
cases of cold are caused by a viral infection, antibiotics won't have any 
benefit, and may cause unpleasant side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea.
</p> 
<p>Most OTC cold medications aren't suitable for children under six years old. 
If your child is unwell, talk to your pharmacist about the best option if you 
need an OTC medication.</p> 
<p>Many OTC medications contain a combination of different medicines; 
typically a painkiller, such as paracetamol, and a decongestant, such as 
pseudoephedrine.</p> 
<p>If you have recently taken an OTC cold medication, it may not be safe for 
you to take an additional painkiller. Read the manufacturer&rsquo;s patient 
information leaflet carefully before taking the medication, and follow the 
recommended dosage instructions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More information about specific OTC medication is provided below.</p> 
<p><b>Decongestants</b></p> 
<p>Decongestants can be taken by mouth (oral decongestants) or they can be 
taken as a spray in your nose (nasal decongestants). They work by reducing the 
swelling in the passageways of your nose and they may also help to ease 
breathing.</p> 
<p>There's limited evidence to show how effective decongestants are. This type 
of medication may only relieve some people from their cold&nbsp;symptoms. Also, 
when decongestants do work, they often only ease symptoms for a short period of 
time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, decongestants are a safe and rarely cause serious side effects. If 
you use nasal decongestants frequently or for a long time, your congestion may 
end up getting worse.</p> 
<p>Don't give any form of oral decongestant to a child under six years old, as 
it may cause adverse side effects.</p> 
<p>Oral decongestants can cause a rise in blood pressure and heart rate, 
leading to a feeling of being more alert. Therefore, if you take OTC 
decongestants at bedtime, you may have problems sleeping at night. Oral 
decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and phenylephrine 
are used in many OTC cold remedies.</p> 
<p>Oral decongestants may interact with some antidepressants and 
beta-blockers. If you're taking either of these medicines, check with your GP 
or pharmacist before taking oral decongestants. If you have high blood pressure 
(hypertension), heart problems or glaucoma (a group of eye conditions that 
affect vision), check with your GP before using an oral decongestant.</p> 
<p>Nasal decongestants work specifically on the nose. They're usually safe for 
adults and older children to use. Nasal decongestants, such as oxymetazoline, 
xylometazoline, phenylephrine and ephedrine are applied directly to the inside 
of the nose. They are available as nose drops or sprays.</p> 
<p>Nasal decongestants shouldn't be used for more than five to seven days 
because using them for longer can actually make your congestion worse. If 
you're taking a type of antidepressant called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor 
(MAOI), you shouldn't use nasal decongestants.</p> 
<p><b>Painkillers</b></p> 
<p>Paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin can help to reduce a fever. They also act 
as painkillers (for children, use children&rsquo;s liquid paracetamol). Always 
follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that the correct dose is given.
</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken alternately over the course of a day 
as long as you don't exceed the maximum dose for each. However, children 
mustn't be given both ibuprofen and paracetamol. You must either use one or the 
other. Using both could cause adverse side effects. Always follow the 
manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions carefully.</p> 
<p>Paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin are also included in some OTC cold 
medicines with other ingredients. Check with your pharmacist or GP before 
taking a cold remedy if you're taking any other painkillers.</p> 
<p>Don't take ibuprofen if you have a history of stomach ulcer, indigestion, 
asthma or kidney disease. Aspirin should also not be taken by children who are 
under 16 years old or by women who are breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>If you're pregnant, paracetamol &ndash;&nbsp;not ibuprofen &ndash; should 
be used for the short-term relief of mild to moderate pain and fever.</p> 
<p><b>Zinc supplements</b></p> 
<p>Taking zinc syrup, tablets or lozenges may be an effective treatment for 
the common cold.</p> 
<p>A&nbsp;2011 Cochrane review suggests that taking zinc supplements within a 
day of the symptoms starting will speed up recovery and lessen the severity of 
symptoms.</p> 
<p>However,&nbsp;long-term use of zinc isn't recommended as it could cause 
side effects such as vomiting and diarrhoea.</p> 
<p>More research is required to determine the recommended dose.</p> ^^ Back to 
top <br>

<h2>Complications</h2> 
<p><b>Sinusitis</b></p> 
<p>Sinusitis is a fairly common complication of a cold among adults and older 
children, occurring in an estimated 0.5-2% of cases.</p> 
<p>Sinusitis is an infection of the small, air-filled cavities inside the 
cheekbones and forehead.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of sinusitis include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>pain and tenderness around your nose, eyes and forehead&nbsp;</li> 
<li>a blocked and runny nose</li> </ul> 
<p>In most cases, the symptoms of sinusitis will resolve without the need for 
treatment.</p> 
<p><b>Otitis media</b></p> 
<p>Otitis media&nbsp;is a middle ear infection and a common complication of 
colds in children who are under five years old. It occurs in an estimated 20% 
of cases.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of otitis media include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>severe earache</li> 
<li>a high temperature (fever) of or above 38&deg;C (100&deg;F)&nbsp;</li> 
<li>flu-like symptoms, such as vomiting and lethargy (a lack of energy)</li> 
<li>some loss of hearing</li> </ul> 
<p>Approximately 80% of cases of otitis media will resolve themselves without 
treatment, usually within three days.<br>
<br>
 Additional treatment is usually 
only required if your child has repeated episodes of otitis media.</p> ^^ Back 
to top <br>

<h2>Prevention</h2> 
<p>As there are so many different viruses that can cause the common cold, a 
vaccination against the condition hasn't&nbsp;been developed yet.</p> 
<p>However, if you have a cold, there are things you can do to help prevent it 
from spreading.</p> 
<p>You should:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>wash your hands regularly and properly, particularly after touching your 
nose or mouth and before handling food&nbsp;</li> 
<li>always sneeze and cough into tissues as this will help to prevent the 
virus-containing droplets from your nose and mouth entering the air where they 
can infect others; throw away used tissues immediately and wash your hands&nbsp;
</li> 
<li>clean surfaces regularly to keep them free of germs&nbsp;</li> 
<li>use your own cup, plates, cutlery and kitchen utensils&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
<li>use disposable paper towels to dry your hands and face, rather than shared 
towels. As with tissues, always dispose of the paper towels after you have 
finished using them</li> </ul> ^^ Back to top <br>

<h2>Children</h2> 
<p>A cold is a viral infection that affects the nose, throat and sinuses. 
There are more than&nbsp;200 different cold viruses. While adults usually have 
two to four colds a year, children can catch as many as seven to 10.</p> 
<p>Dr Rob Hicks, a GP in London,&nbsp;offers&nbsp;his advice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Is my child&rsquo;s cold serious?</strong></p> 
<p>Colds aren't usually serious. However, babies, the elderly and anyone whose 
immune system is compromised can be at risk of developing more serious 
complications, such as a bacterial chest infection.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the differences between adult and child colds?</strong></p>
<p>Children contract colds far more often than adults. Cold symptoms in a 
child may include araised temperature (fever).</p> 
<p><strong>When should I take my child to the doctor?</strong></p> 
<p>Most colds get better on their own without treatment. Seek medical advice 
if:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a&nbsp;baby aged less than&nbsp;three months develops a fever higher than 
38&deg;C</li> 
<li>cold symptoms last for more than 10 days, particularly if your child is 
coughing up green, yellow or brown sputum or has a fever &ndash; this could be 
a sign of a bacterial infection that needs treatment with antibiotics</li> 
<li>your child is finding it difficult to breathe. Seek medical help 
immediately from your surgery or local hospital</li> 
<li>your child complains of pain in the nasal passages after two to four days 
of home treatment</li> 
<li>your baby or child has, or seems to have, severe earache (babies with 
earache often rub their ears and seem irritable) as they could have an ear 
infection that may need antibiotic treatment</li> 
<li>your child complains of throat pain for longer than three or four days, or 
their throat pain seems unusually severe, as they may have bacterial 
tonsillitis that needs antibiotic treatment</li> 
<li>your child develops other symptoms such as pain or swelling in the face or 
in the chest, a headache or a very bad sore throat</li> 
<li>your child seems to be getting worse rather than better</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Why won&rsquo;t my doctor prescribe antibiotics for my 
child&rsquo;s cold?</strong></p> 
<p>Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Colds, 
however, are caused by viruses, which don&rsquo;t respond to antibiotics. The 
overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance where symptoms 
don&rsquo;t respond to treatment with antibiotics. The doctor is likely to 
prescribe antibiotics only if your child has developed a bacterial infection 
secondary to (on top of) a cold.</p> 
<p><b>Top tips for parents</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>encourage your child to rest and make sure they drink plenty of fluids. 
Water is fine but warm drinks can be soothing</li> 
<li>if they have a blocked nose you can make their breathing easier by raising 
the pillow end of your child&rsquo;s bed or cot by putting books or bricks 
under the legs or placing a pillow under the mattress</li> 
<li>paracetamol liquid or ibuprofen liquid can help ease a fever and pain. 
Check the dosage instructions on the packaging. Never give aspirin to children 
under 16 years old</li> 
<li>a&nbsp;warm, moist atmosphere can ease breathing if your child has a 
blocked nose &ndash; take your child into the bathroom and run a hot bath or 
shower or use a vaporiser to humidify<br>
 the air</li> 
<li>keep the room aired and at a comfortable temperature, and don't let your 
child get too hot. If a small child or baby has a temperature let them wear 
just a nappy or underwear</li> </ul>
