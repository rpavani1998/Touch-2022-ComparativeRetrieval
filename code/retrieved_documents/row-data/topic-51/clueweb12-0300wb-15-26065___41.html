 Description  An 
in-depth report on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the most 
common form of arthritis. Back to Top <br>
 Highlights 
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> 
<p>Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most 
common form of arthritis. It is a long-term disease of the joint cartilage and 
bone, commonly thought to result from &quot;wear and tear&quot; on a joint. 
There are also other causes, such as some birth defects, trauma, and metabolic 
disorders.</p> 
<p><strong>Risk Factors:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>In people younger than 45, osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males. 
After age 45, it develops more often in females.</li> 
<li>Obesity places people (particularly women) at a higher risk for 
osteoarthritis.</li> 
<li>Some occupations with repeated stressful motions can contribute to the 
deterioration of cartilage.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Three types of exercise are best for people with 
osteoarthritis:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Strengthening exercises, which include isometric exercises (pushing or 
pulling against static resistance). For patients with arthritis in the hip or 
knees, exercises that strengthen the muscles of the upper leg are important.
</li> 
<li>Range-of-motion exercises increase the amount of movement in a joint and 
muscle.</li> 
<li>Aerobic, or endurance, exercises help control weight and may reduce 
inflammation in some joints.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Complementary Medicine:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acupuncture appears to be a safe and may be a helpful addition to standard 
therapy for some patients, such as pregnant women, who cannot take most pain 
medications.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Surgery:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>A recent study found that elderly patients with poorly controlled 
osteoarthritis do very well after joint replacement surgery. However, 
physicians often neglect to suggest this option to older patients.</li> 
<li>A variation on the traditional hip replacement is the newer procedure 
known as minimally invasive hip replacement. This surgeion must be extremely 
experienced. The procedure uses special instruments and a shorter incision (3 - 
6 inches vs. 10 - 12 inches in traditional hip replacement).</li> </ul> Back to 
Top <br>
 Introduction 
<p>Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most 
common form of arthritis. Scientists now believe osteoarthritis results from a 
combination of genetic problems and joint injuries. In this disorder, a joint 
loses cartilage, the slippery material that cushions the ends of bones, over 
time.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>As a result, the bone beneath the cartilage changes and develops bony 
overgrowth. The tissue that lines the joint can become inflamed, the ligaments 
can loosen, and the muscles around the joint can weaken. The patient feels pain 
when using the joint. Nearly all vertebrates suffer from osteoarthritis, 
including porpoises and whales, as did dinosaurs.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Joints</h3> 
<p>Joints provide flexibility, support, stability, and protection. Specific 
parts of the joint: the<i>synovium</i> and <em>cartilage,</em> provide these 
functions.</p> 
<p><i>Synovium.</i> The synovium is the fluid-filled lining of a joint. <em>
Synovial fluid</em> is a lubricating liquid that supplies nutrients and oxygen 
to cartilage.</p> 
<p><i>Cartilage.</i> The cartilage is a slippery tissue that coats the ends of 
the bones. Cartilage is one of the few tissues in the body that does not have 
its own blood supply. It has a number of essential parts, including:</p> Click 
the icon to see an image of the synovial membrane and cartilage in the knee 
joint. <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Chondrocytes. Chondrocytes, the basic cartilage cells, are critical for 
balance and function.</li> 
<li>Water. Cartilage contains a lot of water, which decreases with age. About 
85% of cartilage is water in young people. Cartilage in older people is about 
70% water.</li> 
<li>Proteoglycans. These large molecules help make up cartilage. They are 
important because they can bond to water, which keeps high amounts of water in 
cartilage.</li> 
<li>Collagen. This essential protein in cartilage forms a mesh to give the 
joint support and flexibility. Collagen is the main protein found in<em>all</em>
 connective tissues of the body, including the muscles, ligaments, and tendons.
</li> </ul> 
<p>The combination of collagen mesh and water forms a strong and slippery pad 
in the joint. This pad cushions the ends of the bones in the joint during 
muscle movement.</p> 
<h3>Osteoarthritis: The Disease Process</h3> 
<p><i>Deterioration of Cartilage.</i> Osteoarthritis develops when cartilage 
in a joint deteriorates. The process is usually slow.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In the early stages of disease, the surface of the cartilage, or the 
synovium (joint lining) in some people, becomes inflamed and swollen. The joint 
loses proteoglycan molecules and other tissues. This joint then begins to lose 
water. Fissures and pits appear in the cartilage.</li> 
<li>As the disease progresses and more tissue is lost, the cartilage starts to 
get hard. As a result, it becomes increasingly prone to damage from repetitive 
use and injury.</li> 
<li>Eventually, large amounts of cartilage are destroyed, leaving the ends of 
the bone within the joint unprotected.</li> </ul> 
<p>Complicating the process are abnormalities in the bone around arthritic 
joints. As the body tries to repair damage to the cartilage, problems can 
develop:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Clusters of damaged cells or fluid-filled cysts may form around the bony 
areas or near the fissures in the cartilage.</li> 
<li>Fluid pockets may also form within the bone marrow itself, causing 
swelling. The marrow, which runs up through the center of the bone, is rich in 
nerve fibers. As a result, these injuries may cause a lot of pain in many 
patients with osteoarthritis.</li> 
<li>Bone cells may respond to damage by multiplying, growing, and forming 
dense, misshapen plates around exposed areas.</li> 
<li>At the margins of the joint, the bone may produce outcroppings, on which 
new cartilage cells (chondrocytes) multiply and grow abnormally.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Location of Osteoarthritis</h3> 
<p>Unlike some other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis does not spread through the entire body. Rather, it affects one 
or several joints. Osteoarthritis affects joints differently depending on their 
location in the body.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It is common in joints of the fingers, feet, knees, hips, and spine.</li> 
<li>It sometimes occurs in the wrist, elbows, shoulders, and jaw, but it is 
not common in these locations.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Causes 
<p>The biological factors leading to the deterioration of cartilage in 
osteoarthritis are not entirely understood. Many experts believe that 
osteoarthritis results from a genetic susceptibility that causes some 
biological response to injuries to the joint, which in turn leads to 
progressive deterioration of cartilage. In addition, the body's ability to 
repair cartilage decreases with increasing age.</p> 
<h3>Aging Cells</h3> 
<p>Although osteoarthritis generally accompanies aging, osteoarthritic 
cartilage is chemically different from normal cartilage of the same age. As 
chondrocytes (the cells that make up cartilage) age, they lose their ability to 
make repairs and produce more cartilage. This process may play an important 
role in the development and progression of osteoarthritis.</p> 
<h3>Genetic Factors</h3> 
<p>Researchers report a high correlation of osteoarthritis between parents and 
children, and between siblings. Genetic factors may be involved in about half 
of osteoarthritis cases in the hands and hips, and in a somewhat lower 
percentage of cases in the knee. Several genes that might contribute to an 
inherited risk are under investigation. For example, mutations in the ank gene 
may be important in some cases. The ank gene regulates pyrophosphate, a 
chemical that inhibits the formation of mineral deposits, and may protect the 
cartilage in joints. About 60% of people with osteoarthritis have mineral 
deposits in their cartilage. Mutations in the ank gene may result in lower 
pyrophosphate levels in the joint, leading to accumulation of mineral deposits 
and arthritis.</p> 
<p>Another gene, called the osteoprotegerin gene, is important in regulating 
bone and cartilage formation. Mutations in this gene may also play a role in 
osteoarthritis.</p> 
<h3>Inflammatory Response and Matrix Metalloproteinases</h3> 
<p>The inflammatory response is an overreaction of the immune system to an 
injury or other assault in the body, such as an infection. This response causes 
specific immune factors, called cytokines, to gather in injured areas and cause 
inflammation and damage to body tissue and cells. The inflammatory response 
plays an important role in rheumatoid arthritis and other muscle and joint 
problems associated with autoimmune diseases.</p> 
<p>Inflammation probably plays at most a minor role in the formation of 
osteoarthritis and is more likely to be a result -- not a cause -- of the 
disease. However, inflammation may play an important role in the progression of 
osteoarthritis and in its chronic nature. The effects of the inflammatory 
response in osteoarthritis are likely to be different, and less severe, from 
those in rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<p>Some theories on how the inflammatory response may contribute to 
osteoarthritis involve overproduction of enzymes called matrix 
metalloproteinases or MMPs (also called collagenases). Large amounts of MMPs 
break down collagen, the building blocks of cartilage. Some studies suggest 
that immune factors called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are 
overproduced during the inflammatory response and in turn increase production 
of MMPs.</p> 
<p>Another theory suggests that the inflammatory response is triggered by the 
changes and injuries in the bone that occur during osteoarthritis. According to 
this theory, the cartilage absorbs the immune factors released in this process. 
Once in the cartilage, these immune factors suppress cartilage cell growth, and 
activate MMPs.</p> 
<h3>Abnormal stress or Injuries</h3> 
<p>Joint damage from injuries or recurrent stress to the joint is the starting 
point in the osteoarthritis disease process. Osteoarthritis sometimes develops 
years after a single traumatic injury to or near a joint. Patients with knee 
injuries may be up to five times more likely to have osteoarthritis in the 
injured knee than those without injuries, and patients with hip injuries may be 
more than three times more likely to develop arthritis in the injured hip. 
Proper treatment of injuries, such as surgical repair of ligament tears in the 
knee with a strong rehabilitation approach, may help prevent the development of 
osteoarthritis.</p> 
<h3>Other Medical Conditions that Can Cause Osteoarthritis</h3> 
<p>Other causes of osteoarthritis include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as hemophilia
</li> 
<li>Disorders that block the blood supply near a joint, such as avascular 
necrosis</li> 
<li>Complications of persistent, inflammatory arthritic conditions, 
particularly chronic gout, pseudogout, or rheumatoid arthritis</li> 
<li>Conditions that cause iron build-up in the joints, such as hemochromatosis
</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Symptoms 
<p>The pain of osteoarthritis typically begins gradually and progresses slowly 
over many years. People under age 40 may have the condition with no symptoms at 
all. Osteoarthritis is commonly identified by the following symptoms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Pain that worsens during activity and gets better during rest. This is the 
most common symptom of osteoarthritis. As the disease advances, the pain may 
occur even when the joint is at rest.</li> 
<li>Pain is generally described as aching, stiffness, and loss of mobility. 
The symptoms are often worse when resuming activities after periods of no 
activity.</li> 
<li>The pain may be intermittent, with bad spells followed by periods of 
relative relief.</li> 
<li>Pain seems to increase in humid weather.</li> 
<li>Some people have muscle spasm and contractions in the tendons.</li> 
<li>Osteoarthritis in the knee may cause a crackling-like noise (called 
crepitus) when moved.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Symptoms by Location</h3> 
<p><em>Hand</em>. Osteoarthritis of the hand occurs most often in older women 
and may be inherited within families. The following joints are most frequently 
affected:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint</em>. The first joint below the 
fingertips is the most common location of osteoarthritis of the hand. These 
joints can develop bony growths known as Heberden's nodes.</li> 
<li><em>Carpometacarpal (CMC) joint</em>. The joint at the base of the thumb, 
where the thumb joint connects with the wrist, is the second most common 
location.</li> 
<li><em>Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint</em>. The middle joints of the 
fingers can also develop osteoarthritis. These joints may develop small, solid 
lumps (nodules) known as Bouchard's nodes.</li> </ul> Click the icon to see an 
image of osteoarthritis. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Osteoarthritis of the hand may predict the later development of 
osteoarthritis in the hip or knee.</p> 
<p><em>Knee</em>. Osteoarthritis is particularly debilitating in the 
weight-bearing joints of the knees. The meniscus, the cartilage pad between the 
joint formed by the thighbone and the shinbone, plays an important role in 
protecting this joint. It acts as a shock absorber. The joint is usually stable 
until the disease reaches an advanced stage when the knee becomes enlarged and 
swollen. Although painful, the arthritic knee usually retains reasonable 
flexibility.</p> 
<p>In a knee surgery called meniscectomy, the doctor removes damaged meniscus 
(cartilage) after an injury. However, preserving the meniscus, even if it is 
damaged, is believed to be better than removing it, since even a small amount 
of meniscus helps protect the joint and prevent osteoarthritis from worsening. 
Experts recommend that patients try lifestyle changes (exercise and weight 
loss), braces, and medication before having knee surgery.</p> Click the icon to 
see an image of the knee joint. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><i>Hips.</i> About 1 in 4 people will develop hip arthritis over the course 
of their lifetime. Being obese increases the risk. Osteoarthritis frequently 
strikes the weight-bearing joints in one or both hips. Pain develops slowly, 
usually in the groin and on the outside of the hips, or sometimes in the 
buttocks. The pain also may radiate to the knee, confusing the diagnosis. Those 
with osteoarthritis of the hip often have a restricted range of motion 
(particularly when trying to rotate the hip) and walk with a limp, because they 
slightly turn the affected leg to avoid pain.</p> Click the icon to see an 
image of the hip joint. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><i>Spine.</i> Osteoarthritis may affect the cartilage in the disks that 
form cushions between the bones of the spine, the moving joints of the spine 
itself, or both. Osteoarthritis in any of these locations can cause pain, 
muscle spasms, and diminished mobility. In some cases, the nerves may become 
pinched, which also produces pain. Advanced disease may result in numbness and 
muscle weakness. Osteoarthritis of the spine is most troublesome when it occurs 
in the lower back or in the neck, where it can cause difficulty in swallowing.

<br>
<br>

<p><i>Shoulder.</i> Osteoarthritis is less common in the shoulder area than in 
other joints, but it may develop in the shoulder joint (the glenohumeral 
joint). In such cases, it is most often associated with a previous injury, and 
patients gradually develop pain and stiffness in the back of the shoulder. 
Osteoarthritis also can develop in the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, which is 
between the shoulder blade and the collarbone. However, it rarely causes 
symptoms in this location.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Conditions with Similar 
Symptoms 
<p>Numerous conditions cause symptoms of joint aches and pains. Something as 
simple as sleeping on a bad mattress or as serious as cancer can mirror 
symptoms of osteoarthritis. Other problems that can cause aches and pains in 
the joints include physical injuries, infections, tendinitis, and poor 
circulation. A number of rare genetic diseases attack the joints.</p> 
<p>Osteoarthritis can generally be distinguished from other joint diseases by 
considering several factors together:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Osteoarthritis usually occurs in older people and is located in only one 
or a few joints.</li> 
<li>The joints are less inflamed than in other arthritic conditions.</li> 
<li>Progression of pain is usually gradual.</li> </ul> 
<p>Below are a few of the most common disorders that can be confused with, or 
may even accompany, osteoarthritis.</p> 
<h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3> 
<p>Osteoarthritis may be confused with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly when 
osteoarthritis affects multiple joints in the body. Rheumatoid arthritis begins 
in the synovial membrane rather than the cartilage. It normally occurs earlier 
in life than osteoarthritis, often striking people in their 30s and 40s. 
Rheumatoid arthritis affects many joints, and often occurs symmetrically on 
both sides of the body. People with rheumatoid arthritis generally have morning 
stiffness that lasts for at least an hour. (Stiffness from osteoarthritis 
usually clears up within half an hour.) Although osteoarthritis can 
occasionally cause swollen, red joints, this appearance is much more typical of 
rheumatoid arthritis and other types of inflammatory arthritis.</p> 
<p>X-rays of joints affected with rheumatoid arthritis show changes in the 
bones that differ from those occurring in osteoarthritis. In rheumatoid 
arthritis, blood tests often show a specific antibody, known as rheumatoid 
factor, which is not present with osteoarthritis. In another blood test, levels 
of a factor called erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often elevated in 
rheumatoid arthritis, but they are generally normal in osteoarthritis. 
Rheumatoid arthritis also does not usually show up in the fingertips where 
osteoarthritis is common.</p> <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Chondrocalcinosis</h3> 
<p>Chondrocalcinosis is a disease in which calcium crystals known as CPPD 
(calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) accumulate in the joints. This condition 
affects about 25% of the population and can accompany and even worsen 
osteoarthritis. Chondrocalcinosis has been called pseudogout or 
pseudo-osteoarthritis, the latter particularly when it affects the knees. A 
doctor can usually differentiate between the two disorders, however, because 
chondrocalcinosis usually damages other joints (such as wrists, elbows, and 
shoulders) that are not normally affected by osteoarthritis. The condition may 
explain why some patients with osteoarthritis benefit from colchicine, a drug 
used for gout and other crystal-induced joint diseases.</p> 
<h3>Charcot's Joint</h3> 
<p>Charcot's joint occurs when an underlying disease, usually diabetes, causes 
nerve damage in the joint, which leads to swelling, bleeding, increased 
temperature, and changes in bone. There may be a loss of sensation that leads 
to an increased risk of injury from overuse.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Risk Factors 
<p>In the U.S., osteoarthritis affects about 12.1% of adults over 25 (21 
million people). The prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age. Older 
adults are at higher risk for osteoarthritis.</p> 
<h3>Gender</h3> 
<p>In people younger than 45, osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males 
(although it is not common in younger adults). After age 45, it develops more 
often in females. Some research suggests that women may also experience greater 
muscle and joint pain, in general, than men.</p> 
<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>The incidence of osteoarthritis is highest in people with lower educational 
levels. In a 2000 study, 41% of adults with less than a high school education 
had arthritis, compared to 21% of college graduates.</p> 
<h3>Geography</h3> 
<p>Although the average rate of osteoarthritis among older adults in the U.S. 
is 60%, it can vary widely among geographical regions. The rates in older 
adults are lowest (34%) in Hawaii and highest (70%) in Alabama. In general, the 
highest prevalence of arthritis in the United States occurs in the central and 
northwestern states.</p> 
<h3>Ethnicity and Inheritance</h3> 
<p>The rate of osteoarthritis varies among ethnic groups. In the U.S., 
Caucasians and African-Americans have higher rates of arthritis than Hispanics 
or other ethnic groups. Osteoarthritis also tends to favor specific joints over 
others in certain ethnic groups. The following are some examples:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Older African-American men are about 33% more likely than Caucasian men to 
have hip osteoarthritis. In one study, although men in both groups had equal 
risks for arthritic knees, African-American men were more likely to have 
arthritis in both knees and to have more severe cases. Although comparable 
disparities in knee arthritis were observed between African-American and 
Caucasian women, they might be explained by greater average weight among 
African-American women. The study could not account for the differences among 
men, however.</li> 
<li>Asians appear to have a higher incidence of osteoarthritis in the knee, an 
equal risk for osteoarthritis in the spine, and a lower risk for osteoarthritis 
in the hips compared to Caucasians.</li> </ul> 
<p>Genes that determine the angles, amount of force, and other structural 
factors in the hip joints, or genes that regulate the chemistry in the joints, 
may account for ethnic differences.</p> 
<h3>Physical and Anatomical Factors</h3> 
<p>Some researchers suggest that a number of people have anatomical 
abnormalities, such as mismatched surfaces on the joints, which could be 
damaged over time. Legs of unequal length or skewed feet can cause jerky 
movement and may cause osteoarthritis. One study reported that people whose 
knees bent inward (&quot;knock-kneed&quot;) or outward 
(&quot;bow-legged&quot;), for example, were more likely to have progressive 
osteoarthritis of the knee.</p> 
<h3>Obesity</h3> 
<p>Obesity, defined as being 20% over one's healthy weight, places people 
(particularly women) at increased risk for osteoarthritis. It also worsens 
osteoarthritis once deterioration begins. This higher risk is due to increased 
weight on the joints. However, being obese also increases the risk for 
osteoarthritis in the fingers as well as the knees and hips, suggesting that 
being overweight may contribute to osteoarthritis in other ways. Some research 
indicates that obesity may produce an inflammatory response, which is now a 
major suspect in age-related diseases -- not only osteoarthritis but also heart 
disease. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #53: Weight control 
and diet.]</p> 
<h3>Work and Leisure Factors</h3> 
<p>Because injuries can trigger the disease process, people whose work or 
leisure activities place them at risk for muscle and joint injuries may face a 
higher risk for osteoarthritis later on.</p> 
<p><i>Workers at Higher Risk.</i> Certain occupations with repeated stressful 
motions (such as squatting or kneeling with heavy lifting) can contribute to 
the deterioration of cartilage. People with jobs that require kneeling or 
squatting for more than an hour a day are at high risk for knee osteoarthritis. 
Jobs that involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking also pose some risk.</p> 
<p><i>Exercise.</i> There has been some question about the role of strenuous 
exercise in osteoarthritis. Sports that definitely pose a higher risk for 
osteoarthritis have repetitive or direct joint impact (such as football), joint 
twisting, or both (baseball pitching, soccer). The increase in exercise 
intensity by young girls, including increased incidence of significant 
injuries, has raised concerns that we may see an increase in the incidence of 
future osteoarthritis.</p> 
<p>Regular and moderate exercise, however, is important for everyone and does 
<i>not</i> increase the risk for osteoarthritis. Recreational weight-bearing 
exercise (walking, jogging), done by middle-aged and elderly people, neither 
prevents osteoarthritis nor increases risk. Furthermore, many factors 
associated with a sedentary life (muscle weakness, obesity) are associated with 
a higher risk for osteoarthritis.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Diagnosis 
<p>Osteoarthritis is often visible in x-rays. Cartilage loss is suggested by 
certain characteristics of the images:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The normal space between the bones in a joint is narrowed.</li> 
<li>There is an abnormal increase in bone density.</li> 
<li>Bony projections, cysts, or erosions are visible.</li> </ul> 
<p>If the doctor suspects other conditions, or if the diagnosis is uncertain, 
additional tests are necessary.</p> 
<p>It is important to note that a negative x-ray does not rule out 
osteoarthritis. Likewise, some people may have minimal symptoms even though an 
x-ray clearly shows they have arthritis.</p> 
<p>An MRI exam of an arthritic joint is generally not needed, unless the 
doctor suspects other causes of pain.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Physical Exam</h3> 
<p>The affected joint in patients with osteoarthritis will generally be tender 
to pressure right along the joint line. Joint movement may cause a crackling 
sound. The bones around the joints may feel larger than normal. The joint's 
range of motion is often reduced, and normal movement is often painful.</p> 
<h3>Blood Tests</h3> 
<p>Blood test results may help identify other causes of arthritis (if present) 
besides osteoarthritis. Some examples include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Elevated levels of rheumatoid factor (specific antibodies in the synovium) 
are usually found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis</li> 
<li>The erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR, or &quot;sed rate&quot;) 
indicates inflammatory arthritis or related conditions, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.</li> 
<li>Elevated uric acid levels in the blood may indicate gout.</li> </ul> 
<p>A number of other blood tests may help identify other rheumatological 
illnesses.</p> 
<h3>Tests of the Synovial Fluid</h3> 
<p>If the diagnosis is uncertain or infection is suspected, a doctor may 
attempt to withdraw synovial fluid from the joint using a needle. There will 
not be enough fluid to withdraw if the joint is normal. If the doctor can 
withdraw fluid, problems are likely, and the fluid will be tested for factors 
that might confirm or rule out osteoarthritis:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cartilage cells in the fluid are signs of osteoarthritis.</li> 
<li>A high white blood cell count is a sign of infection.</li> 
<li>High uric acid in the fluid is an indication of gout.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Other factors may be present that suggest different arthritic conditions, 
including Lyme disease and rheumatoid arthritis.</li> 
<li>In people with known osteoarthritis, researchers may look for certain 
factors in synovial fluid (sulfated glycosaminoglycan, keratin sulfate, and 
link protein) that can suggest a more or less severe condition.</li> </ul> Back 
to Top <br>
 Prognosis 
<p>Osteoarthritis itself is not life threatening, but a person's quality of 
life can significantly deteriorate as a result of pain and lost mobility. The 
negative effects of osteoarthritis on activities and physical and mental health 
are significant regardless of age, educational level, or gender. Only heart 
disease has a greater impact on work. Five percent of people who leave the work 
force do so because of osteoarthritis. Unless alleviated by medication or 
corrected by surgery, a patien with advanced osteoarthritis may avoid even 
relatively low-impact activities, such as walking. No treatment can cure 
osteoarthritis, and none can alter its progression with certainty, but many 
available treatments can relieve symptoms and significantly improve the quality 
of life.</p> Back to Top <br>
 Lifestyle Changes 
<p>Many doctors suggest first trying lifestyle changes to reduce stress on 
affected joints. Physical therapy and supportive devices can be helpful. 
Intensive education on how to protect and care for an osteoarthritic joint may 
help patients avoid multiple visits to their doctor.</p> 
<h3>Occupational Changes</h3> 
<p>Once they have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, patients should reduce 
shock to the affected joint. Hammering away at deteriorating cartilage is 
likely to speed up the degeneration. People in occupations with repetitive and 
stressful movement should find ways to reduce trauma. Adjusting the work area 
or substituting tasks that produce less stress on joints helps reduce shock.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3> 
<p>Joints need motion to stay healthy. Long periods of inactivity cause the 
arthritic joint to stiffen and the adjoining tissue to atrophy (waste away). A 
moderate exercise program that includes low-impact aerobics and power and 
strength training has benefits for osteoarthritic patients, even if exercise 
does not slow down the disease progression. Exercise helps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduce stiffness and increase flexibility. It may also help improve the 
strength and elasticity of knee cartilage.</li> 
<li>Promote weight loss.</li> 
<li>Improve strength, which in turn improves balance and endurance.</li> 
<li>Reduce stress and improve feelings of well being, which helps patients 
cope with the emotional burden of pain.</li> </ul> 
<p>Exercise especially helps patients with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in 
the hip or in the knee. Many patients who begin an aerobic or resistance 
exercise program report less disability and pain. They are better able to 
perform daily chores and remain more independent than their inactive peers. 
Older patients and those with medical problems should always check with their 
doctor before starting an exercise program.</p> 
<p>Three types of exercise are best for people with osteoarthritis:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Strengthening exercise</li> 
<li>Range-of-motion exercise</li> 
<li>Aerobic, or endurance, exercise</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Strengthening Exercise</i>. Strengthening exercises include isometric 
exercises (pushing or pulling against static resistance). Isometric training 
builds muscle strength while burning fat, helps maintain bone density, and 
improves digestion. For patients with arthritis in the hip or knees, exercises 
that strengthen the muscles of the upper leg are important.</p> 
<p>Some experts encourage patients to emphasize strengthening leg muscles as a 
first treatment step, before using pain relievers. Patients who rely on 
painkilling drugs may overuse knees, which do not have muscle tissue 
sufficiently strong enough to protect the joints from further damage. However, 
some studies suggest that building up thigh muscles may worsen osteoarthritis 
in people whose knees are misaligned (for instance those who are 
&quot;bow-legged&quot; or &quot;knock-kneed&quot;). Such individuals should 
check with a physical therapist for the best options. Strengthening the thigh 
muscles is certainly protective for people who have not yet developed 
osteoarthritis.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Range-of-Motion Exercise</i>. These exercises increase the amount of 
movement in a joint and muscle. In general, they are stretching exercises. The 
best examples are yoga and tai chi, which focus on flexibility, balance, and 
proper breathing. In one study, older adults who practiced the gentle movement, 
breathing, and meditation exercises of tai chi for 10 weeks reported less pain 
than their peers who did not learn the technique.</p> Click the icon to see an 
image of cholesterol. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><em>Aerobic (Endurance) Exercise</em>. These exercises help control weight 
and may reduce inflammation in some joints. Low-impact workouts also help 
stabilize and support the joint. Cycling and walking are beneficial, and 
swimming or exercising in water is highly recommended, for people with 
arthritis. (Patients with osteoarthritis should avoid high-impact sports, such 
as jogging, tennis, and racquetball.)</p> Click the icon to see an image of 
exercise. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Physical Therapy</h3> 
<p>In addition to exercise, manipulation of muscles and joints by a trained 
therapist may be helpful. If patients fail to improve on a home program, a 
referral to a physical therapist may be beneficial.</p> 
<h3>Weight Reduction</h3> 
<p>Overweight patients with osteoarthritis can lessen the shock on their 
joints by losing weight. Knees, for example, sustain an impact three to five 
times the body weight when descending stairs. Losing 5 pounds of weight can 
eliminate 20 pounds of stress on the knee. The greater the weight loss, the 
greater the benefit. [For more information, see<em>In-Depth Report</em> #53: 
Weight loss and diet.]</p> 
<h3>Vitamins and Other Dietary Factors</h3> 
<p><i>Calcium and Vitamin D.</i> Calcium and vitamin D are important for 
strong bones. Although osteoarthritis is primarily a disease of joints, bone 
strength is also important, particularly in older people.</p> Click the icon to 
see an image of osteoporosis. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Heat and Ice</h3> 
<p><i>Ice.</i> When a joint is inflamed (particularly in the knee) applying 
ice for 20 - 30 minutes can be effective. If an ice pack is not available, a 
package of frozen vegetables works just as well.</p> 
<p><i>Heat Treatments.</i> Patients afflicted with osteoarthritis of the hands 
can relieve pain with hot soaks and warm paraffin application. Osteoarthritis 
of the hip can be treated with heating pads.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, moving to a warm climate does not seem to make much 
difference. According to one study, people who live in warmer places are 
actually more sensitive to small shifts in temperature than people who live in 
cold damp climates, and they feel pain as readily as their northern peers do in 
response to larger temperature shifts.</p> 
<h3>Mechanical Aids</h3> 
<p>A wide variety of devices are available to help support and protect joints:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Splints or braces, worn while the joint is at rest or in use, help align 
joints and properly distribute weight. They are used most frequently to treat 
arthritic hands, wrists, knees, ankles, and feet. Many of these devices allow 
some movement within the affected joint and do not restrict nearby joints. They 
are usually made from lightweight metal, leather, elastic, foam, and moldable 
plastic with easy-to-use Velcro straps. Any brace, splint, or other device for 
joint protection should be custom-fitted by a physical or occupational 
therapist, or an orthotist. Poorly fitting or improperly used braces or splints 
can cause more harm than good.</li> 
<li>A commonly used brace for knee osteoarthritis that involves only one side 
of the knee joint is called an offloading brace.</li> 
<li>Using elastic supports on affected joints may benefit some people. For 
example, in one study, wearing insoles plus elastic straps supporting the ankle 
joint helped overweight women with osteoarthritis in the knee. It is important 
to consult with a doctor about how to use elastic supports.</li> 
<li>Wrapping the knee with special therapeutic tape that provides support to 
specific parts of the joint may be effective. In one clinical trial, patients 
experienced a 40% reduction in pain within a few days. They wore the tape for 3 
weeks, and pain relief continued for 3 more weeks following treatment. Physical 
therapists or other trained health professionals should apply the tape. 
Longer-term studies are needed to determine if these benefits are continuous.
</li> 
<li>Wearing orthopedic shoes or shock-absorbing soles in shoes can help during 
daily activities and gentle exercise. Heel wedges in the shoes can sometimes 
help patients avoid knee replacement surgery.</li> 
<li>A firm mattress also often proves beneficial.</li> 
<li>Canes, crutches, or walkers offer benefits to patients with advanced 
arthritis.</li> 
<li>Specially designed hip protectors, worn under the clothes, can also 
protect against hip fractures in elderly patients with impaired mobility who 
are apt to fall.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 Medications 
<p>Many medications are available for relieving the symptoms of 
osteoarthritis. A major analysis indicated that drug therapy is generally more 
effective than non-drug treatments (surgery, acupuncture). However, a 2006 
review of knee osteoarthritis studies found that pain-relief medications 
generally help only for the first 2 - 3 weeks of treatment. The following are 
some of the medications used in mild-to-severe cases:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acetaminophen</li> 
<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors</li> 
<li>Capsaicin</li> 
<li>Tramadol</li> 
<li>Narcotic pain relievers (oxycodone, oxymorphone, or morphine)</li> 
<li>Glucosamine and chondroitin (see <em>Alternative and Complementary Medicine
</em> section)</li> </ul> 
<h3>Acetaminophen</h3> 
<p>Acetaminophen (Tylenol, Anacin-3, Panadol, Phenaphen, Valadol, and others) 
is currently the first choice for treating osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen may be 
less effective than NSAIDs in reducing moderate-to-severe pain. Because 
acetaminophen has fewer side effects, most experts suggest trying this drug 
first, then switching to an NSAID if acetaminophen does not provide sufficient 
pain relief.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> Acetaminophen is inexpensive and generally safe. It 
poses far less of a risk for gastrointestinal problems than NSAIDs and does not 
appear to increase the risk for miscarriage (as NSAIDs do), even when used 
regularly.</p> 
<p>It does have some adverse effects, however, and the daily dose should not 
exceed 4 grams (4,000 mg). Patients who take high doses of this drug for long 
periods are at risk for liver damage, particularly if they drink alcohol and do 
not eat regularly.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3> 
<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block prostaglandins, the 
substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain. There are 
dozens of NSAIDs available:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Over-the-counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil, Nuprin, 
Motrin IB, and Rufen), naproxen (such as Aleve and Naprosyn), ketoprofen (such 
as Actron and Orudis KT).</li> 
<li>Prescription NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, 
Anaprox), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam), tolmetin 
(Tolectin), ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail), nabumetone (Relafen), dexibuprofen 
(Seractil), indomethacin (Indocin), meloxicam (Mobic, generic).</li> 
<li>Topical NSAIDs delivered in gels, creams, or patches do not appear to 
provide any long-term benefits in reducing arthritic pain. A review of clinical 
trial data, published in 2004, suggested that guidelines that recommend topical 
NSAIDs for treatment of osteoarthritis should be revised.</li> </ul> 
<p>Many experts now recommend that patients use oral NSAIDs for only a short 
period of time. Long-term use of NSAIDs does not actually delay the progression 
of osteoarthritis and may increase patients' risk of side effects. High dosages 
of NSAIDs can cause heart problems (such as increased blood pressure), kidney 
problems, and stomach bleeding.</p> 
<p>Drug manufacturers of prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs must now 
include with their products the same boxed warning used for the COX-2 inhibitor 
celecoxib (Celebrex). This boxed warning emphasizes an increased risk for 
cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding in people taking these 
drugs. Due to its proven heart benefits, aspirin was excluded from these 
labeling revisions.</p> 
<p>Both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are equally effective for pain relief and 
pose similar risks for heart attacks.</p> 
<h3>NSAID-Induced Ulcers and Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h3> 
<p>Long-term use of NSAIDs is the second most common cause of ulcers, and the 
rate of NSAID-caused ulcers is increasing. Such ulcers are also more likely to 
bleed than those caused by the bacteria<em>H. pylori</em>. NSAID-related 
bleeding and stomach problems may be responsible for 107,000 hospital 
admissions and 16,500 deaths each year. Because there are usually no 
gastrointestinal symptoms from NSAIDs until bleeding begins, doctors cannot 
predict which patients taking these drugs will develop bleeding.</p> 
<p>Among the groups at high risk for bleeding are elderly people, anyone with 
a history of ulcers or digestive tract bleeding, patients with serious heart 
conditions, alcohol abusers, and those on certain medications, such 
anticoagulants (&quot;blood thinners&quot;), corticosteroids, or 
bisphosphonates (drugs used for osteoporosis).</p> Click the icon to see an 
image of a gastric ulcer. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><i>Drugs for Prevention NSAID-Induced Ulcers.</i> If you have NSAID-induced 
ulcers, follow these steps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Switch to alternative pain relievers. This is the first step in preventing 
or healing ulcers caused by NSAIDs. If people cannot change drugs, they should 
use the lowest NSAID dose possible.</li> 
<li>Try proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). These drugs help reduce NSAID-induced 
ulcer rates by as much as 80% compared with no treatment. Brands include 
omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), 
rabeprazole (AcipHex), and pantoprazole (Protonix).</li> 
<li>Try misoprostol or diclofenac sodium/misoprostol (Arthrotec). If other 
drugs are inappropriate, misoprostol protects against the major intestinal 
toxicity of NSAIDs. It was the first drug approved for preventing NSAID-induced 
ulcers. It is equally or even more, effective than some of the PPIs, but it 
does not heal existing ulcers and has more side effects than PPIs. Patients 
tend to stop using it. Arthrotec is a combination of misoprostol and the NSAID 
diclofenac. One study found that patients taking Arthrotec had 65 - 80% fewer 
ulcers than those who took NSAIDs alone.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Healing Existing Ulcers</i>. A number of drugs are available to heal 
NSAID-induced ulcers. Treatment takes about 2 - 6 weeks. Proton-pump inhibitors 
are the most effective drugs. Others that may be beneficial include sucralfate 
(or H2 blockers), such as famotidine (Pepcid AC), cimetidine (Tagamet), 
ranitidine (Zantac).</p> 
<h3>COX-2 Inhibitors (Coxibs)</h3> 
<p>Coxibs inhibit an inflammation-promoting enzyme called COX-2. This drug 
class was initially thought to provide benefits equal to NSAIDs but cause less 
gastrointestinal distress. However, following numerous reports of 
cardiovascular events, as well as skin rashes and other adverse effects, the 
FDA has been re-evaluating the relative risks and benefits of this drug class. 
Rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib (Bextra) have been withdrawn from the United 
States market. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is still available, but patients should 
discuss with their doctors whether this drug is appropriate and safe for them.
</p> 
<h3>Capsaicin</h3> 
<p>Capsaicin is a component of hot red peppers and may bring pain relief when 
used as a skin cream (Zostrix). This is the only skin preparation that does 
more than just mask pain or reduce it temporarily. Capsaicin seems to reduce a 
substance in the body, known as substance P, which contributes both to 
inflammation and the delivery of pain impulses from the central nervous system. 
A small amount of capsaicin must be applied to the area of inflammation about 
four times a day. During the first few days of use, the patient will experience 
a warm, stinging sensation when the cream is applied. This sensation goes away, 
and pain relief usually begins within 1 - 2 weeks.</p> 
<h3>Tramadol</h3> 
<p>Tramadol (Ultram) is a pain reliever that has been used as an alternative 
to opioids. It has opioid-like properties but is not as addictive. (Dependence 
and abuse have been reported, however.) It can cause nausea but does not cause 
severe gastrointestinal problems, as NSAIDs can. Some patients experience 
severe itching. A combination of tramadol and acetaminophen (Ultracet) is now 
available and provides more rapid pain relief than tramadol alone, with more 
long-lasting benefits than acetaminophen. Side effects are the same as for each 
of these drugs.</p> 
<h3>Narcotics</h3> 
<p>Narcotics, pain-relieving and sleep-inducing drugs that act on the central 
nervous system, are the most powerful medications available for the management 
of moderate-to-severe pain. There are two types of narcotics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Opiates,</i> which are derived from natural opium (morphine and codeine)
</li> 
<li><i>Opioids</i>, which are synthetic drugs. They include oxycodone (such as 
Percodan, Percocet, Roxicodone, and OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), 
oxymorphone (Numorphan), and fentanyl (Duragesic)</li> </ul> 
<p>Although the use of narcotics for arthritic pain is controversial, many 
studies have suggested that they are rarely addictive for pain sufferers except 
among patients with a history of substance abuse. Opioids may have a place in 
osteoarthritis treatment when milder drugs are not effective or appropriate.</p>
<p>The use of such drugs may be beneficial when included as part of a 
comprehensive pain management program. Such a program involves screening 
prospective patients for possible drug abuse and then regularly monitoring 
those who are taking it, adjusting the dose as necessary to achieve an 
acceptable balance between pain relief and side effects. Common side effects 
include anxiety, constipation, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, 
paranoia, urinary retention, restlessness, and labored or slow breathing. 
Unfortunately, opioid abuse among young people is a major concern.</p> 
<h3>Corticosteroids</h3> 
<p>When pain becomes a major problem and less potent pain relievers are 
ineffective, doctors may try corticosteroid (steroid) injections, usually by 
giving the patient a shot in their joint every 3 months. Corticosteroid shots 
are useful only if inflammation is present in the joint. Relief from pain and 
inflammation is of short duration, and this treatment is rarely used for 
chronic osteoarthritis. These drugs may not be as effective for women as they 
are for men.</p> 
<p>Patients are usually advised not to have more than two or three injections 
a year, since there is some concern that repeated injections over the long term 
may be harmful. A reassuring study found no greater disease progression in 
people who had injections every 3 months for 2 years compared to those who were 
given sham injections on the same schedule. Because long-term use of 
corticosteroids has many potentially serious side effects, steroid medications 
are never given by mouth or systemically for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
</p> 
<h3>Hyaluronic Acid Injections (Viscosupplementation)</h3> 
<p>Shots of hyaluronic acid (such as Hyalgan, Synvisc, Artzal, and Nuflexxa) 
into the joint -- a procedure called viscosupplementation -- are one of the 
recommended treatments for osteoarthritis. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally 
occurring substance in joints, which acts as a lubricant for slow movements and 
a shock absorber for fast motions. In high amounts, it also may have 
anti-inflammatory effects.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Patients receive a series of three to five shots spread a week apart.</li> 
<li>The doctor will first use a local anesthetic because these viscous 
(sticky) shots need a large needle.</li> 
<li>The drug is injected into the joint.</li> 
<li>Patients need to avoid weight-bearing activities for about 48 hours after 
each shot.</li> </ul> 
<p>Hyaluronic injections appear to be about as effective as NSAIDs and 
corticosteroid shots for relieving pain, at least in men, and they have no 
adverse effects in the stomach or intestines. While several studies have shown 
a benefit for this treatment, a number of studies on viscosupplementation have 
shown little or no benefits, particularly in women, and more research is needed 
to determine if they are useful. The shots are also expensive. Accurate 
placement of the needle directly into the knee joint space is important and may 
be difficult, even for experienced doctors, if there is no fluid build-up in 
the joint. Best success rates are with a specific approach into the kneecap 
called the lateral midpatellar.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> Serious adverse reactions are rare. The most common 
side effects, pain at the injection site and knee pain and swelling, are 
usually mild and temporary. More research is needed to confirm benefits and 
long-term risks.</p> 
<h3>Investigational Therapies</h3> 
<p>Researchers are studying various drugs that may provide pain relief or stop 
the disease process itself: The treatments below are still experimental, and 
may not be available to patients in the United States.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bisphosphonates such as alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel) 
help prevent bone loss in people with osteoporosis. They are currently being 
investigated for osteoarthritis as well.</li> 
<li>Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline, may have a role to play in 
treating osteoarthritis. Initial results from clinical trials suggest that 
doxycycline may help delay joint space narrowing. Its effects on osteoarthritis 
pain are less clear, and side effects of long-term treatment with tetracycline 
are unknown.</li> 
<li>Licofelone is a drug that inhibits both the COX enzyme plus an 
inflammatory substance called lipoxygenase 5. Early trials indicate it may be 
as effective, and safer, than either NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors. In addition to 
pain relief, licofelone may actually slow down the progression of 
osteoarthritis.</li> 
<li>Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections are being investigated for 
patients with knee osteoarthritis. However, no strong evidence to date supports 
its use.</li> 
<li>Clinical trials of gene therapies that either fight joint degradation or 
strengthen cartilage are in very early stages.</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
 
Alternative and Complementary Medicine 
<p>Glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate are natural substances 
that are part of the building blocks found in and around cartilage. Extracts of 
these substances have been used in Europe for more than a decade to reduce pain 
and improve mobility in patients with osteoarthritis. For many years, 
researchers in the U.S. have been studying whether these dietary supplements 
really work for relieving osteoarthritis pain.</p> 
<p>Earlier studies indicated a potential benefit from these agents. However, 
several high-quality studies involving large numbers of patients have indicated 
that, in general, glucosamine and chondroitin do not seem to provide any more 
help than a placebo for the symptoms of osteoarthritis.</p> 
<p><em>Dosage</em>. There are no current recommended dosages. Patients in the 
National Institute of Health's GAIT trial took 1,500 mg of glucosamine and 
1,200 mg of chondroitin.</p> 
<p><i>Side Effects.</i> The safety records of both substances appear 
excellent. Long-term effects are still unknown, but studies of up to 3 years 
have reported no significant side effects. However, there are some concerns 
that glucosamine may affect insulin and blood sugar (glucose) metabolism. 
Patients with diabetes should not take glucosamine without first talking to 
their doctors.</p> 
<h3>Other Herbs and Supplements</h3> 
<p><i>Ginger (Zingiberaceae).</i> No good evidence indicates that Ginger 
provides a benefit for osteoarthritis.</p> 
<p><em>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe).</em> S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, 
pronounced &quot;Sammy&quot;) is a synthetic form of a natural byproduct of the 
amino acid methionine. It has been marketed as a remedy for both depression and 
arthritis, but scientific evidence supporting these claims is scant. Cost can 
run $60 - 120 per month.</p> 
<h3>Herbs and Supplements</h3> 
<p>Generally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not 
need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and 
supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential 
to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been several reported 
cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. Always 
check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.
</p> 
<h3>Acupuncture</h3> 
<p>Acupuncture is being increasingly used to reduce osteoarthritis pain. The 
technique is painless and involves the insertion of small fine needles at 
select points in the body. The studies of thousands of patients with chronic 
osteoarthritis pain compared acupuncture to conventional treatment (such as 
physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs). These studies showed positive 
results lasting for up to 6 months after treatment. However, when acupuncture 
treatment was compared to sham acupuncture, any benefit was minimal. In any 
case, acupuncture appears to be a safe and beneficial addition to standard 
therapy for certain patients, such as pregnant women, who cannot take most pain 
medications.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation</h3> 
<p>Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) uses low-level electrical 
pulses to suppress pain. Patients are barely aware of the sensation. According 
to one study, the optimal treatment length is 40 minutes. A variant (sometimes 
called percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or PENS) applies these pulses 
through a small needle to acupuncture points. A review of trials reported that 
both methods were better than placebo (sham treatments) in treating 
osteoarthritis of the knee, although additional well-designed studies are 
needed.</p> 
<h3>Low-Level Laser Therapy</h3> 
<p>Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) generates extremely pure light in a single 
wavelength. It does not produce heat and is painless. Some researchers are 
combining LLLT with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). Studies 
report widely varying results, with some showing significant reductions in pain 
and others reporting no effect. The differences may be due to different 
approaches, and standardized methods are needed before any benefits can be 
shown.</p> 
<h3>Hydrotherapy</h3> 
<p>Hydrotherapy, also called spa therapy or balneotherapy, is an ancient 
therapy that uses bathing in mineral baths for soothing pain. Although many 
studies report positive results, including improved quality of life, very few 
of them have been rigorously conducted. A major analysis reported weak evidence 
on any real effect of hydrotherapy on pain or quality of life, but some 
patients may find comfort in this pleasant therapy.</p> Back to Top <br>
 
Surgery 
<p>Different surgical procedures are available as a final measure to relieve 
pain and increase function in patients with osteoarthritis. Certain surgical 
procedures can help relieve pain if medications fail. Even with these 
procedures, however, joint replacement may still be needed later on.</p> 
<h3>Arthroscopy</h3> 
<p>Arthroscopy is performed to clean out bone and cartilage fragments that, in 
theory at least, may cause pain and inflammation. More than 650,000 of these 
procedures are done on arthritic knees each year in the U.S., and about half of 
patients report less pain after the procedure.</p> 
<p>A rigorous 2002 trial, however, found that arthroscopic knee surgery was no 
more effective than sham surgery (in which surgeons only pretended to operate 
on the knee) for relief of osteoarthritic pain or stiffness. The study, which 
followed patients at a Veterans Affairs hospital for 2 years, has called into 
serious question whether the popular procedure has any real benefits for 
osteoarthritis beyond what might be achieved by a placebo response. Research 
and debate continues on whether arthroscopy provides true benefits for those 
with osteoarthritis and, if so, which patients may benefit the most from it. 
Arthroscopy is most likely to benefit people with evidence of bone and 
cartilage fragments in the joint, or patients whose joints lock or catch with 
movement.</p> Click the icon to see an illustrated series detailing knee 
arthroscopy surgery. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Joint Replacement (Arthroplasty)</h3> 
<p>When osteoarthritis becomes so severe that pain and immobility make normal 
functioning impossible, many people become candidates for artificial 
(prosthetic) joint implants using a procedure called arthroplasty. Hip 
replacement is the most established and successful replacement procedure, 
followed by knee replacement. Knee replacement, in fact, has a slightly better 
long-term success rate than hip replacement. Other joint surgeries (such as 
shoulders, elbows, wrists, and fingers) are less common, and some arthritic 
joints (in the spine, for instance) cannot yet be treated in this manner. When 
two joints, such as both knees, need to be replaced, having the operations done 
sequentially rather than at the same time may result in fewer complications.</p>
Click the icon to see an illustrated series detailing knee joint replacement 
surgery. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><em>Candidates.</em> The primary indications for surgery are pain and 
significant limitations of movement, including walking, that cannot be treated 
by less invasive therapies. Some experts suggest, however, that joint 
replacement should be considered earlier rather than as a last resort. They 
argue that patients who wait until they are severely disabled do not recover as 
completely as those who have the procedure earlier.</p> 
<p>Patients who may not be good candidates are those with the following 
conditions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Severe neurologic, emotional, or mental disorders</li> 
<li>Severe osteoporosis</li> 
<li>Other chronic medical conditions</li> 
<li>Obesity</li> </ul> 
<p>Surgeons often prefer to delay prosthetic implantation in younger patients, 
because implants wear out and the patient will need at least one revision 
procedure later on. Newer, longer-lasting materials, however, may help reduce 
the rate of revision operations.</p> 
<p>Elderly patients with poorly controlled osteoarthritis often do very well 
after joint replacement surgery. While full recovery may take older patients 
longer than younger people, the long-term outcome of the surgery is excellent, 
and leads to significant improvements in pain and quality of life. Depending on 
the number of other medical problems present, older patients should also be 
assessed for hip replacement procedures.</p> 
<p>Although the following is mostly a description of hip replacement surgery, 
the principles are similar for other arthroplasty surgeries.</p> 
<p>The surgeon removes the ball and socket joint that joins the pelvis and 
thigh bone (femur) and replaces it with an artificial joint (a prosthesis). It 
is composed of two pieces:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A cup-like device fits in the hip socket (called the <em>acetabula</em>), 
which has been hollowed out. This ball-and-socket cup is positioned to form the 
new joint.</li> 
<li>A metal shaft, or stem, with a polished metal ball at the top, is inserted 
into the narrow center of the femur.</li> </ul> 
<p>The prosthesis is usually made of a metal alloy and plastic. A ceramic 
implant may prove to last longer than other materials and be a safe option for 
younger patients.</p> 
<p>There are different options available for attaching it to the adjoining 
bones:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A cement made of polymethylmethacrylate (usually preferred for older 
patients who generally have thinner bones).</li> 
<li>So-called cementless implants, in which the prosthesis is coated with a 
porous material that allows bone to grow into and eventually adhere to the 
device. These implants are usually used for patients younger than age 65, who 
are likely to need repeat surgery in their lifetime.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Minimally invasive hip replacement surgery.</em> A variation on the 
traditional hip replacement is the newer procedure known as minimally invasive 
hip replacement. This procedure, which requires an extremely experienced 
surgeon, uses special instruments and a shorter incision (3 - 6 inches vs. 10 - 
12 inches in traditional hip replacement). The patients report less pain and 
are usually able to go home within 48 hours after surgery. Minimally invasive 
hip replacement can be done with 1 or 2 incisions. The 2 incision technique is 
more complicated and time consuming, and at the moment seems to have a higher 
rate of complications.</p> Click the icon to see an illustrated series 
detailing hip joint replacement surgery. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><em>Complications.</em> Complications can occur, and, although uncommon, 
some can be life threatening. There is a 1% chance of death within 3 months of 
an initial procedure and a 2.6% risk after a repeat procedure. The risks are 
highest in the first 3 months. Those at highest risks for complications are 
elderly adults, men (compared to women), African-Americans, and those with 
serious medical conditions.</p> 
<p>Specific complications include the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Deep blood clots in the legs (known as deep vein thrombosis) and pulmonary 
embolism. Deep blood clots can develop in the legs after this surgery. This 
poses a very small risk (0.9%) for pulmonary embolism -- a dangerous condition 
in which the clot travels to the lungs. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) are 
important for preventing blood clots. These drugs include warfarin and 
low-molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulant therapy is given during the 
hospital stay and continued for several weeks at home. The patient also wears 
specially fitted elastic stockings to help prevent clots. Patients who are 
overweight are at higher than average risk for post-operative blood clots</li> 
<li>Infection. Wound infection occurs in about 0.2% of joint replacements and 
requires prompt removal of the implant to treat the infection. A new prosthesis 
must be re-implanted at a later time. Any pre-existing infection must be 
treated and cured before surgery is performed. (Older women should be aware of 
urinary tract infections, which may require postponing surgery.) After surgery, 
patients should take certain precautions. For example, they should take 
antibiotics before invasive dental procedures or other surgery because bacteria 
can be introduced into the bloodstream and infect the areas around the 
artificial joints.</li> 
<li>Hip dislocation. Occurs in about 3.1% of first hip procedures. The rate is 
much higher (14.4%) in revision operations.</li> </ul> Click the icon to see an 
image of a dislocated hip. <br>
<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Pain. Thigh pain can occur after hip replacement. Porous hip prostheses 
are more likely to produce thigh pain than cement implants, although advanced 
techniques using a tapered shaft are reducing this complication.</li> 
<li>Failure. The primary reason for implant failure is osteolysis (bone 
destruction) caused by long-term wear. The main source of wear is from tiny 
particles released from the prosthesis.</li> 
<li>Other complications. These include uneven leg lengths, nerve damage that 
can cause numbness or weakness, urinary tract infections, delayed healing, and 
allergic reactions to the metal. Long-term, there have been rare reports of a 
possible<i>autoimmune</i> response, in which loose particles released from the 
prosthetic device trick certain immune system factors into attacking healthy 
cells. Any incidence of unexplained weight loss and fatigue may be symptoms of 
this uncommon event.</li> </ul> 
<p><i>Rehabilitation.</i> Aside from the surgeon's skill and the patient's 
underlying condition, the success rate depends on the kind and degree of 
activity the joint receives following replacement surgery.</p> 
<p>The patient is urged and aided into getting out of bed and walking the day 
after surgery. Most hip replacement patients leave the hospital within a week 
and can walk with crutches within 2 - 4 weeks, recovering fully in about 3 
months.</p> 
<p>Physical therapy takes about 6 weeks to rebuild adjoining muscle and 
strengthen surrounding ligaments. Studies suggest that an exercise program 
started before surgery and resumed afterward can improve recovery. Continuous 
passive motion (CPM) is an effective regimen for knee replacement patients. It 
uses a mechanical device that slowly moves the joint through an arc of motion 
for an extended period of time. It is used to prevent scar tissue from 
developing. In one review, a combination of physical therapy and CPM were more 
beneficial than physical therapy alone.</p> 
<p><em>Limitations After Surgery.</em> While many patients find that joint 
replacement provides remarkable pain relief and restores some mobility, they 
need time to adjust to the artificial joint.</p> 
<p>Limitations after hip surgery include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Usually patients with new hips are able to walk several miles a day and 
climb stairs, but they cannot run.</li> 
<li>Prosthetic hips should not be flexed beyond 90 degrees, so patients must 
learn new ways to perform activities requiring bending down (like tying a shoe).
</li> </ul> 
<p>Limitations after knee surgery include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Walking distance improves in 80% of patients after knee replacement 
surgery, but patients still cannot run.</li> 
<li>Only slightly more than half of patients report improvement in stair 
climbing. (Artificial knee joints generally have a range of motion of just 110 
degrees.)</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Failure Rates.</em> Infection is a major cause of early failure and 
always requires revision. Improper balancing of the ligaments and other tissues 
surrounding the joint and resulting poor joint stability is also a common 
reason for failure of arthroplasty. Surgical expertise is important for 
avoiding this complication.</p> 
<p>Older cement prostheses have a particularly high rate of bone loss and 
loosening due to cement deterioration. In general, studies report reoperation 
rates of over 30% after 10 years. Fortunately, advances in cement and 
prosthetic implants are improving the implant survival rates and reducing the 
need for revision procedures.</p> 
<p>Uncemented arthroplasty using porous material has shown good results for 
the hip, although it may be less successful for knee replacement. In spite of 
short-term success, longer experience with this method suggests it may not be 
superior to cement prostheses. Failure of bone to grow into the porous material 
is a relatively common event, a problem that does not occur with cement 
prostheses. Some experts recommend cement implants over cementless ones for 
total knee arthroplasty.</p> 
<h3>Revision Arthroplasty</h3> 
<p>A repair procedure called arthroplasty revision may be used in cases where 
the original transplant fails. The specific procedure depends on whether the 
bone defects that occurred are<i>contained</i> or <i>uncontained</i>.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Contained defects can be repaired with small bone grafts, the use of 
cement, or oversized cementless implants as required.</li> 
<li>Uncontained defects are more severe and may require a large bone graft or 
specially constructed implants to restore bone.</li> </ul> 
<p>If a second arthroplasty is required, the potential for complications is 
magnified: more bone is cut, more blood is lost, and the operation takes 
longer. Patients are also generally older and more vulnerable to complications.
</p> 
<h3>Other Joint Procedures</h3> 
<p><em>Resection Arthroplasty.</em> In resection arthroplasty, a false joint 
of scar tissue is created. This procedure is used most often in treating 
arthritis of the foot.</p> 
<p><em>Osteotomy.</em> If only a certain section (the medial compartment) of 
the knee is damaged and deformed by osteoarthritis, the surgeon may choose to 
perform an osteotomy:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The surgeon opens the knee.</li> 
<li>The surgeon performs a <em>debridement</em> (removal of damaged tissue) in 
the joint to eliminate the loose or torn fragments that are causing pain and 
inflammation.</li> 
<li>The bone is then reshaped to remove the deformity.</li> 
<li>The procedure may ease symptoms and slow disease progression. It is best 
used in heavier adults who are under 60 years old.</li> </ul> 
<p><em>Hemicallotasis.</em> Hemicallotasis is a procedure for the knee that 
may be a less invasive alternative to osteotomy. The surgeon attaches the knee 
with pins to an external frame-like device that lengthens the deformed part of 
the knee over several weeks. The patient is mobile during this period. 
Infections at the pin site are the most common complications.</p> 
<p><em>Arthrodesis.</em> If the affected joint cannot be replaced, surgeons 
can perform a procedure called arthrodesis that eliminates pain by fusing the 
bones together. The patient must understand, however, that fusing the bones 
makes movement of the joint impossible. Bone fusion is most often done in the 
spine and in the small joints of the hands and feet.</p> 
<p><em>Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.</em> Unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty (also called unicondylar knee arthroplasty) may be a useful 
procedure in cases of limited knee damage. It is recommended for relatively 
sedentary patients who are 60 years or older and not obese. It may relieve pain 
and delay the need for a total knee replacement. The procedure involves a small 
incision and insertion of small implants. It retains important knee ligaments, 
which preserve more movement than a total knee replacement.</p> 
<p><em>Cartilage Transplants.</em> Autologous chondrocyte implantation, also 
called chondroplasty or the Carticel approach, is used for knees damaged by 
injuries. In this procedure, arthroscopy is used to first remove cartilage in 
eroded areas. The results have been good to excellent, although long-term 
benefits are questionable. Whether it has any benefit for older patients with 
osteoarthritis is not yet known. Other cartilage transplant procedures are also 
under study.</p> 
<p><em>Hip Resurfacing.</em> Hip resurfacing is a surgical alternative to 
total hip replacement. It involves scraping the surfaces of the hip joint and 
femur and placing a metal cap over the bone. The procedure preserves much of 
the bone, so that a standard hip replacement can be done years later if needed. 
It may provide more stability, a faster recovery, and greater range of motion, 
making it a potentially good option for young, physically active patients.</p>
