<p><strong>(LifeWire)</strong> - It's hard to beat the convenience of 
over-the-counter (OTC) medications, especially when a family member needs quick 
relief from a fever. But just because OTC drugs don't require a doctor's 
approval doesn't mean choosing them can be done carelessly. Fever reducers need 
to target each person's age and weight, among other factors, to be as effective 
and safe as possible.</p> 
<p>Scanning store shelves when looking for fever reducers can be dizzying 
because so many brands and dosages are available. But don't let the wide array 
of packaging fool you: Only two classes of OTC medications are designed 
specifically to lower fever, which is defined as 100.4 F or higher in infants. 
(Normal body temperatures vary among individuals and with the time of day.)</p> 
<p><strong>Products Containing Acetaminophen:</strong> This is the first class 
of OTC medication designed to lower a fever. It is found in brands such as 
Tylenol and Anacin-3 (acetaminophen). It is also an active ingredient in more 
than 600 drugs, both prescription and OTC. This class of medicine includes not 
only fever reducers, but also pain relievers, cough suppressants and cold 
remedies.</p> 
<p><strong>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):</strong> These are 
better known in their abbreviated form, as NSAIDs, and these are the second 
class of OTC meds. These are also used primarily for fever and pain relief. 
Meds with this active ingredient within this class include the brand names of 
Advil and Motrin (ibuprofen), Aleve (naproxen sodium) or common aspirin.</p> 
<p>Both drug classes have venerable safety records for fever reduction, but 
aspirin should never be used for this purpose in children under 19 years of 
age, who are more vulnerable to a deadly disease known as Reye's syndrome. The 
cause and cure of Reye's syndrome are still unknown, but its development in 
children is widely linked to the use of aspirin, which contains the chemical 
salicylate. (Check the labels. This chemical is sometimes listed in different 
forms, including acetylsalicylate, acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid.)</p>
<p>Children with colds or viruses, including chicken pox, who are given 
aspirin can experience the rapid onset of Reye's, whose symptoms include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Listlessness</li> 
<li>Ongoing vomiting</li> 
<li>Confusion</li> 
<li>Lethargy</li> 
<li>Aggressive or irrational behavior</li> </ul> 
<p>If you suspect your child is developing Reye's syndrome, which can occur 
even without aspirin ingestion, then seek emergency medical care immediately.
</p> 
<p>The age of the person taking an OTC fever reducer is important in choosing 
the appropriate type. So is their weight. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs are 
available in a variety of forms and dosages to satisfy these important criteria.
</p> 
<p>Liquid medicines, often designed for children, are typically packaged with 
a small cup, dropper or cylindrical spoon to increase dosage accuracy. Don't 
use household spoons to administer medication, since they are rarely equivalent 
to the teaspoon or tablespoon dose advised on the package.</p> 
<p>Tablets and caplets, usually aimed at adults, come in various shapes and 
sizes, as well as dose levels. Fever reducers also can be taken rectally as 
suppositories, which is useful if the patient is vomiting and cannot ingest 
anything by mouth.</p> 
<p>Be sure to read the label of any medicine you or a family member is about 
to take. All OTC medication labels list the active ingredient(s), what symptoms 
the product helps, who it's for, how much to take and how often. Labels also 
state if the product is safe for children over 2. The US Food and Drug 
Administration recommends that OTC cough and cold medicines not be used for 
those less than 2 years old and are not advised for those under 4. However, 
single-ingredient OTC fever reducers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen are 
approved for infants, though parents are advised to consult a doctor regarding 
the correct dosage for those under 2.</p> 
<p>What else to watch for when using these meds? Unintentional overdoses of 
fever reducers are quite common because their active ingredients are duplicated 
in other common OTC medications. For instance, a cold sufferer may take a 
multi-symptom cold medicine containing acetaminophen along with headache 
medicine containing the same active ingredient, essentially receiving a double 
dose, without even realizing it.</p> 
<p>Additionally, these medications can become toxic, even at correct dosages, 
among young children suffering from dehydration due to fever, vomiting and/or 
diarrhea.</p> 
<p>Excess levels of acetaminophen or NSAIDs are not harmless. The risk of 
liver damage increases in those who drink three or more alcoholic beverages 
each day while taking ongoing doses of acetaminophen, and emergency rooms see 
many who took much more than the recommended dose and ended up with a 
life-threatening case of acetaminophen poisoning. NSAIDs can cause stomach 
bleeding or kidney problems, especially in senior citizens and those on certain 
medications.</p> 
<p>Check with your doctor if you have any questions about which OTC fever 
reducers are right for you.</p>
