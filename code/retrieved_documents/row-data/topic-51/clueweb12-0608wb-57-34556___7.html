<h1>Influenza Information</h1> 
<h2>Questions and Answers</h2> 
<dl> 
<dt> Why should I be concerned about the flu? </dt> 
<dd> Students, faculty and staff can get sick with flu, and colleges and 
universities may act as a &quot;point of spread.&quot; Students, faculty and 
staff can easily spread flu to others on campus as well as in the Bryan-College 
Station community. To date, the highest number of cases of 2009 H1N1 flu have 
been confirmed among people 5-24 years old. They are also at risk of getting 
seasonal influenza.</dd> 
<dt> Is Texas A&amp;M adequately prepared to handle the 2009-2010 flu season? 
</dt> 
<dd> Yes. Campus preparations are firmly in place for what health officials 
anticipate will be an active season worldwide for both the seasonal flu and the 
H1N1 virus. However, efforts to fully combat the spread of the illness can't be 
successful without the help of all students, faculty and staff. As has been 
widely reported, flu can be spread easily from person to person. Therefore, 
university officials are taking steps to reduce the spread of flu. However, we 
need the entire Aggie Family to help us accomplish this by taking a few 
precautions - get a seasonal flu shot, practice good hand-washing procedures, 
avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and cover your cough. We continue to 
work closely with the local, state and federal health officials to monitor flu 
conditions and make decisions about the best steps to take concerning our 
institution. We will keep you updated with new information as it becomes 
available to us. For now, we are doing everything we can to keep Texas A&amp;M 
operating as usual.</dd> 
<dt> What steps should Texas A&amp;M students, faculty and staff take to stay 
healthy and keep from spreading the flu?</dt> 
<dd> Here are four important ways faculty, students and staff can stay healthy 
and keep from getting sick with flu or spreading the flu. They should:
<ul> 
<li>Practice good hand hygiene. They should wash their hands often with soap 
and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand cleaners 
are also effective.</li> 
<li>Practice respiratory etiquette. The main way flu spreads is from person to 
person in droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, so it's important that 
people cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze. If 
they don't have a tissue, they should cough or sneeze into their elbow or 
shoulder, not their hands.</li> 
<li>Stay home if they are sick. Stay home or in their place of residence for 
at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no long have a fever.</li> 
<li>Talk to their health care providers about whether they should be 
vaccinated. Students, faculty and staff who want protection from the flu are 
encouraged to get vaccinated for seasonal flu. Also students, faculty and staff 
who are at higher risk for flu complications from 2009 H1N1 flu should consider 
getting the H1N1 vaccine. People at higher risk for 2009 H1N1 flu complications 
include pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions (such as 
asthma, heart disease or diabetes). For more information about priority groups 
for vaccination, visitwww.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/acip.htm. </li> </ul> 
Students, faculty and staff should take personal responsibility to help slow 
the spread of the flu virus. By practicing these steps, they can keep from 
getting sick from flu and help protect others from getting the flu.
<h3>Contamination and Cleaning </h3> With the growing concern about the spread 
of the virus, efforts have intensified campus-wide to help ensure the safety of 
the Aggie family. Custodial Services has implemented supplemental cleaning 
protocols to help ensure that you are as well protected as possible during the 
flu season. In highly trafficked areas, custodians are using sanitizing wipes 
to frequently clean water fountains, door knobs and handles, elevator buttons, 
handrails, glass, trim on doors and light switches. Also, restrooms and 
classrooms are being policed and cleaned more frequently than usual. Residence 
Hall staff will be wiping down common areas frequently with disinfectants. 
Students, faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to consider adopting a 
similar practice in their organizations to help prevent the spread of flu.</dd> 
</dl> 
<h3>Symptoms</h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What are the symptoms of seasonal flu and the 2009 H1N1 flu? </dt> 
<dd> Symptoms of flu include fever or chills <em>and</em> cough or sore 
throat. In addition, symptoms of flu can include runny nose, body aches, 
headache, tiredness, diarrhea or vomiting.</dd> 
<dt> How do I recognize a fever or signs of a fever? </dt> 
<dd> A fever is a temperature that is equal to or greater than 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius when taken with a thermometer. Look for these 
possible signs of fever: if he or she feels very warm, has a flushed 
appearance, or is sweating or shivering.</dd> 
<dt> How do I know if someone has 2009 H1N1 flu or seasonal flu? </dt> 
<dd> It will be very hard to tell if someone who is sick has 2009 H1N1 flu or 
seasonal flu. Public health officials and medical authorities will not be 
recommending laboratory tests. Anyone who has the symptoms of flu-like illness 
should stay home and not go to work.</dd> 
<dt> What fever-reducing medications can students, faculty and staff take when 
sick?</dt> 
<dd> Fever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such 
as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to 
people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their 
pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 
18 years of age who has flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called 
Reye's syndrome.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>Prevention </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What steps are Texas A&amp;M officials taking to keep sick students, 
faculty and staff from spreading flu?</dt> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Strongly encouraging sick students, faculty and staff to stay home and 
away from other people until at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer 
have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever 
(have chills, feel very warm, have flushed appearance or are sweating). This 
should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any 
medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen).</li> 
<li>Sick students are advised to return home for the recommended 
self-isolation period. Residence Life or the Commandant's staff will identify 
appropriate housing accommodations for ill students in the event that 
self-isolation is not possible and/or a student cannot return home. Non-corps 
students should contact their Resident Advisor or Hall Director and corps 
students should contact the Commandant's staff if they believe that they are 
experiencing flu-like symptoms.</li> 
<li>Sick students with private rooms are asked to remain in their own rooms 
and receive care and meals from one person, if possible.</li> 
<li>If students are ill, arrangements for food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) 
can be made by printing out a Sick Tray Request Form found at
http://diningservices.tamu.edu/sicktrays.stm and having a friend take the 
completed form, along with the sick student's ID, to a dining center for food 
pick-up. The Sick Tray Request form authorizes a friend to use the sick 
student's ID to pick up food for them.</li> 
<li>Officials are establishing a method for maintaining contact with students 
who are sick.</li> 
<li>There will be on-going communication to instruct students, faculty and 
staff to promptly seek medical attention if they have a medical condition that 
places them at higher risk of flu-related complications, are concerned about 
their illness or develop severe symptoms. Severe symptoms include increased 
fever, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, fast breathing, bluish skin 
color, vomiting, dizziness or confusion.</li> </ul> </dd> 
<dt> What is self-isolation? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Self-isolation is when sick people stay home and away from other people 
until they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees 
Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have flushed 
appearance, or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of 
fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen). During the period of self-isolation, sick people should limit 
contact with others and try to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from 
people. If close contact cannot be avoided, sick people should wear a surgical 
mask when they are around other people, if they can tolerate it.</p> 
<p>During current flu conditions, people who are sick should stay home and 
away from other people until at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer 
have a fever or signs of a fever. If flu conditions become more severe, those 
who are sick should stay at their home, dormitory or residence hall for at 
least 7 days, even if symptoms go away sooner. People who are still sick after 
7 days should continue to stay home until at least 24 hours after symptoms have 
gone away.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Who should receive a flu vaccination? </dt> 
<dd> Vaccines will be available this year to protect against seasonal flu. 
Children 6 months through 18 years of age, people of any age with chronic 
medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes) and everyone 
age 50 and older should be vaccinated against seasonal flu as early as 
possible. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine became available in the fall of 2009. 
Certain groups at higher risk for complications from this flu are advised to 
get the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine as soon as possible. These groups include:
<ul> 
<li>pregnant women</li> 
<li>people who live with and care for children younger than 6 months of age
</li> 
<li>healthcare and emergency medical services personnel</li> 
<li>people between the ages of 6 months and 24 years (this includes most 
students attending institutions of higher education)</li> 
<li>people ages 25-64 years of age who have chronic health conditions (such as 
asthma, heart disease or diabetes) or compromised immune systems.</li> </ul> 
</dd> 
<dt> Will Texas A&amp;M provide vaccinations for seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu? 
</dt> 
<dd> Yes. Students are strongly encouraged to get the seasonal flu shot for 
fall 2009, available from Student Health Services for $18.00. Please call (979) 
458-8250 to schedule an appointment. The H1N1 vaccination also will be offered 
to students when it becomes available.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>People at Higher Risk for Complications </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> Which students, faculty and staff are at higher risk for complications 
from flu?</dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Anyone can get the flu (even healthy people) and anyone can have serious 
problems from the flu. Students, faculty and staff should be encouraged to talk 
with their health care provider to determine if they are at higher risk for flu 
complications, especially if they have been in close contact with others who 
are sick with flu or flu-like illness.</p> 
<p>Some groups are at higher risk for complications from the flu. These 
include children younger than 5 years of age, pregnant women, people of any age 
with chronic health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease) and 
people 65 years of age and older.</p> </dd> 
<dt> What actions should pregnant students, faculty or staff take to protect 
themselves from the flu?</dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Pregnant women should follow the same guidance as the general public 
related to staying home when sick, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and 
routine cleaning. Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from flu 
and, like all people at higher risk, should speak with their health care 
provider as soon as possible if they develop flu-like symptoms. Early treatment 
with antiviral flu medicines is recommended for pregnant women who have the 
flu; these medicines are most effective when started within the first 48 hours 
of feeling sick.</p> 
<p>Pregnant women should know that they are part of the first priority group 
to receive the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine. Seasonal flu vaccine is also recommended 
for pregnant women and can be given at any time during pregnancy.</p> </dd> 
</dl> 
<h3>If You Are Sick - STUDENTS </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What should students living on campus do if they get the flu? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Students with flu-like illness should remain at home - except if they need 
to seek medical care - and should not go to class, student organization 
meetings, or other events until at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer 
have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever 
(have chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This 
should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any 
medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen).</p> 
<p>If students get sick, and live on campus or in the Bryan-College Station 
area, they are advised to return to their local residence for the recommended 
self-isolation period. Students should not use the university bus system or 
other forms of public transportation if they are ill. Additionally, students 
should avoid driving long distances while ill.</p> 
<p>Residence Life staff or the Commandant's Office will identify appropriate 
housing accommodations for ill students in the event that self-isolation is not 
possible and/or a student cannot return home. Non-corps students should notify 
their Resident Advisor or Hall Director and corps students should notify the 
Commandant's Office if they believe that they are experiencing flu-like 
symptoms.</p> 
<p>Contact the Dial-a-Nurse 24-hour Nurse Advice Line at 979-458-8379 for 
advice about whether to seek medical evaluation and/or how to care for 
yourself. Antiviral medications, if started within the first 48 hours of onset 
of symptoms, may reduce the length of illness. Antiviral medications are 
appropriate for some, but not all, persons with flu-like symptoms.</p> 
<p>Arrangements for food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) can be made by printing 
out a Sick Tray Request Form found at
http://diningservices.tamu.edu/sicktrays.stm and having a friend take the 
completed form, along with the sick student's ID, to a dining center for food 
pick up. The Sick Tray Request form authorizes a friend to use the sick 
student's ID to pick up food for them.</p> 
<p>Also, if students are going to miss class due to illness, it is important 
to communicate directly with their instructor through his/her preferred means 
of communication.</p> </dd> 
<dt> What fever-reducing medications can students take when sick? </dt> 
<dd> Fever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such 
as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to 
people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their 
pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 
18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called 
Reye's syndrome.</dd> 
<dt> What steps should I take if my roommate is sick with the flu? </dt> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>You should limit your contact with your sick roommate and try to maintain 
a distance of 6 feet from him or her.</li> 
<li>If close contact cannot be avoided, your sick roommate should wear a 
surgical mask, if tolerable, when he or she is around you and other people.</li>
<li>You should frequently clean commonly-touched surfaces.</li> </ul> </dd> 
<dt> How long should students with the flu stay at home or in their residence? 
</dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Under current flu conditions, students with flu-like symptoms should stay 
home for at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer have a fever (100 
degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, 
feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This should be 
determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that 
contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). The sick person may decide to stop taking 
fever-reducing medicines as he or she begins to feel better. This person should 
continue to monitor his or her temperature until it has been normal for 24 
hours.</p> 
<p>If flu conditions become more severe, the sick person should stay home or 
in this or her residence for 7 days. A person who is still sick after 7 days 
should stay home until 24 hours after the symptoms have gone away. In addition, 
this longer period should be used in healthcare settings and may be considered 
anywhere a high number of people at higher risk for complications from flu may 
be exposed, such as childcare facilities. Sick people should stay at home or in 
their residence, except to go to the health care provider's office, and they 
should avoid contact with others. Keeping people with a fever at home may 
reduce the number of people who get infected with the flu virus. Because high 
body temperatures are linked with higher amounts of virus, people with a fever 
may be more contagious.</p> </dd> 
<dt> What is Texas A&amp;M's policy regarding sick leave for students? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Most importantly, if students are experiencing flu-like symptoms, please 
stay home - except if you need to seek medical care - and do not go to class , 
student organization meetings, or other events until your fever is gone for a 
24-hour period without fever- reducing medication. The Aggie Honor Code and the 
Student Rules (Rule 7) apply to students who, because of illness, may need to 
makeup absences, exams or assignments. During this flu season, we likely will 
not be able to require a medical professional to verify a flu-like illness for 
an excused medical absence. Faculty members are encouraged to err on the side 
of caution and will use their judgment regarding proper documentation for 
absenteeism. Students will not be penalized if they act responsibly.</p> 
<p>Students who have the flu are strongly encouraged to be proactive in 
communicating with their instructors using the instructor's prescribed method 
of communication. Also, faculty members have been urged to reiterate how they 
want their students to contact them - telephone, email, etc. - if they must 
miss a class.</p> 
<p>Student Health Services has posted a form on its website, titled 
&quot;Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class for Influenza-like 
Illness.&quot; This form will be considered as sufficient documentation for 
class absences related to influenza-like illness. The form and more information 
about how to use the form can be found athttp://flu.tamu.edu.</p> </dd> 
<dt> What should international students do if classes are suspended at a U.S. 
institution of higher education they are attending?</dt> 
<dd> International students should follow all flu recommendations their 
institutions make for students. If classes are suspended during severe flu 
conditions, international students and others who do not have easy access to 
alternative housing should stay on campus. Students should try to limit contact 
with other people. Institutions should plan to continue education through 
distance-based learning methods for students who remain on campus as well as 
those who leave to go home.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>Parent of a sick student </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> As a parent of a student who attends Texas A&amp;M, should I bring them 
home?</dt> 
<dd> If possible, residential students with flu-like illness whose families 
live near the Bryan-College Station area should go home to self-isolate. They 
should return home in a way that limits contact with others as much as 
possible. For example, travel by private car or taxi would be preferable over 
use of public transportation. They should stay away from other people until at 
least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer have a fever (100 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very 
warm, have a flushed appearance or are sweating). This should be determined 
without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains 
ibuprofen or acetaminophen).</dd> 
<dt> Should my child who is a student at Texas A&amp;M get antiviral medicine 
if they get sick?</dt> 
<dd> Parents should make sure their child knows if he or she is at higher risk 
for flu complications. People at higher risk for flu complications, including 
students, faculty and staff with certain chronic medical conditions (such as 
asthma, heart disease or diabetes), who become sick with flu-like illness 
should call their health care provider as soon as possible to determine if they 
need antiviral treatment. Early treatment with antiviral medicines often can 
prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Parents should encourage sick students who 
are at higher risk for flu complications to seek early treatment. Antiviral 
medicines are not given to all people during flu season because most people get 
better on their own, over-use can promote antiviral-resistant viruses and 
administration of antiviral medicines can cause adverse reactions in some 
people.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>If You Are Sick - Faculty &amp; Staff </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What should faculty and staff do if they get the flu? </dt> 
<dd> Most importantly, if you are sick, please stay home - except to seek 
medical care - and do not go to work or class until you have been without a 
fever for 24 hours without taking a fever-reducing medication. We ask that you 
notify your supervisor immediately if you become ill with flu-like symptoms and 
ensure that your leave records are as up-to-date as possible. If you come to 
work sick, you may be required to take leave if your supervisor determines that 
continued work could potentially create a significant risk to co-workers and 
other Texas A&amp;M employees.</dd> 
<dt> What fever-reducing medications can faculty and staff take when sick? 
</dt> 
<dd> Fever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such 
as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to 
people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their 
pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 
18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called 
Reye's syndrome.</dd> 
<dt> What is Texas A&amp;M's policy regarding sick leave for employees? </dt> 
<dd> It is important that Texas A&amp;M System regulations regarding sick leave
(PDF) be followed. As stated in the regulation and in an effort to ease the 
burden on health care providers, if an employee is ill for more than three days 
with the flu, supervisors and/or managers are permitted to allow the employee 
to provide a written statement of the facts concerning the illness without 
requiring a doctor's note. However, based on the specific situation, 
supervisors and/or managers may require documentation by the physician for any 
illness of more than three days.</dd> 
<dt> How long should faculty and staff member with the flu stay at home or in 
their residence?</dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Under current flu conditions faculty and staff with flu-like symptoms 
should stay home for at least 24 hours<em>after</em> they no longer have a 
fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have 
chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This 
should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any 
medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). The sick person may decide 
to stop taking fever-reducing medicines as he or she begins to feel better. 
This person should continue to monitor his or her temperature until it has been 
normal for 24 hours.</p> 
<p>If flu conditions become more severe, the sick person should stay home or 
in their residence for 7 days. A person who is still sick after 7 days should 
stay home until 24 hours after the symptoms have gone away. In addition, this 
longer period should be used in healthcare settings and may be considered 
anywhere a high number of people at higher risk for complications from flu may 
be exposed, such as childcare facilities.</p> 
<p>Sick people should stay at home or in their residence except to go to the 
health care provider's office, and they should avoid contact with others. 
Keeping people with a fever at home may reduce the number of people who get 
infected with the flu virus. Because high body temperatures are linked with 
higher amounts of virus, people with a fever may be more contagious.</p> </dd> 
</dl> 
<h3>International Travel </h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What should I do if I'm planning to travel abroad? </dt> 
<dd> Anyone planning international travel should check with the U.S. 
Department of State (http://www.state.gov/ ) for the most current travel 
alerts, and be familiar with the university'sinternational travel guidelines 
and resources. </dd> </dl> <br>
