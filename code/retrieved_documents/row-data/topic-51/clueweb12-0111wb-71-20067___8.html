<p><b>..'Four Out of Five Doctors Recommend...'</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you've watched the evening news on TV more than three times in your 
life, you might think you know all there is to know about aspirin.</p> 
<p>Because in that short time, you would have seen aspirin buffered and 
time-released, extra-strengthed and effervesced, in a dozen different forms in 
a dozen different commercials.</p> 
<p>You'd have seen it rush to where it hurts five times faster while it was 
twice as gentle to your stomach, unclanging bell-ringer headaches as it 
neutralized neuritis, neuralgia, and a long list of muscular aches and pains.
</p> 
<p>You'd have seen migraines pampered and vanquished, and arthritis pain 
formulized out of existence. And, increasingly, you would have heard it 
extolled as a way of preventing heart attacks.</p> 
<p>But what would you really know about the most widely-used pain reliever of 
all time?<br>
 Not much, probably. Because in spite of the enormity of aspirin 
use, most of us know less about it than any other drug.</p> 
<p>Oh, we know it works -- usually, when taken as directed -- but that's about 
it. And there's a lot more to it than that.</p> 
<p>Because aspirin is a drug. And although it's safe and cheap and effective, 
it can be dangerous -- even deadly -- when used incorrectly or in 
larger-than-recommended doses.<br>
 That's why we've put this pamphlet together.
</p> 
<p>We think it's your right -- your obligation, even -- to know about this 
popular and potent drug. And knowing more about aspirin could save you, or 
someone you care about, a headache or two -- or even a doctor or hospital bill 
someday.</p> 
<p>Want to know more? Then read on...</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>..Aspirin, the Drug</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Since its commercial introduction in 1899 by the Bayer Company, worldwide 
popularity of acetylsalicylic acid -- better known as aspirin -- has grown 
steadily. And so has the variety of aspirin available.</p> 
<p>Today the drug is sold in everything from tablets and capsules to chewing 
gum and elixirs. It's combined with caffeine and countless other drugs, both 
prescription and over-the-counter.<br>
 It's swallowed to prevent heart attacks 
and taken to relieve headaches, fever, rheumatism, arthritis, inflammation, 
hangovers, and other disorders, real and imagined.</p> 
<p>It's available wherever you might happen to be: grocery and drug stores, 
gas stations, airports, restaurants, glove compartments, purses, and desk 
drawers.</p> 
<p>But no matter what form you buy or where you find it, all aspirin works in 
the same way: by blocking production of hormone-like chemicals (called 
prostaglandins) involved in everything from blood circulation and clotting to 
body temperature, digestion, and breathing.</p> 
<p>At high levels, prostaglandins cause pain -- and aspirin just eats up pain.
</p> </blockquote>

<p></p> 
<p><b>..Uses, Abuses</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When used correctly, aspirin is a wonder drug. Its ability to relieve pain 
is unequaled even by many highly-touted prescription drugs.</p> 
<p>But for best results, it's important to use aspirin only as directed. Other 
points to keep in mind:<br>
 Don't take aspirin on an empty stomach, and be 
sure to wash it down with a glass of water. Relief begins within minutes; peak 
effect is reached in about two hours.</p> 
<p>Some experts say a good way to take aspirin is to crush it and mix it with 
orange juice or honey and lemon to reduce stomach irritation and permit faster 
absorption.</p> 
<p>There are also a number of possible side effects and other problems you 
should be aware of if you take aspirin. Just consider these, for starters:</p> 
<p>For some users, aspirin can cause ringing in the ears, dizziness, vomiting, 
and hearing loss. Such symptoms usually disappear when aspirin use stops.</p> 
<p>The most common effect of overuse is stomach upset -- from pain and nausea 
to bleeding ulcers and chronic indigestion.</p> 
<p>Regular aspirin use also damages the kidneys and can trigger sudden renal 
failure.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>..Overuse, Overdose</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Still, the greatest danger of overuse is overdose. As little as 10 grams -- 
about 30 regular-strength tablets -- can be fatal in adults. In 1996, aspirin 
ranked eighth among all drugs as a cause of overdose and poisoning.</p> 
<p>A reason aspirin ranks so high is simple availability.</p> 
<p>A bottle is always around somewhere, waiting to be downed by a curious 
child (aspirin is still a leading cause of poisoning in kids) or by adults who 
think that if a little aspirin makes them feel better, a lot will make them 
feel wonderful.</p> 
<p>These are the people statistics are made of.</p> 
<p>That's why aspirin overdoses should always be regarded as life-threatening 
emergencies requiring fast medical attention.</p> 
<p>As with any other drug, users should also be careful about interactions 
with other drugs. Aspirin interferes with many types of medication, including 
drugs taken for gout, diabetes, and kidney disease.</p> 
<p>Its effects are also altered by vitamin C, which slows elimination of the 
drug from the body, and by alcohol. And despite its use as a hangover cure, 
aspirin is even more irritating to the stomach when used with alcohol.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>..Other Problems</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Even when taken as directed, aspirin still stirs up problems for some 
people.</p> 
<p>Those with conditions such as hemophilia, asthma, or allergies should 
consult their doctors before using any amount of the drug.</p> 
<p>Because aspirin can disrupt normal blood clotting and cause bleeding, it 
should be avoided at least one week prior to surgery and during pregnancy.</p> 
<p>In fact, evidence of the drug's dangers in pregnancy -- including prolonged 
labor, heavier bleeding, and abnormal clotting in mother and child -- has 
prompted federal officials to recommend warning labels for all aspirin products.
</p> 
<p>Children and teenagers are also better off with substitutes. Aspirin can 
trigger a serious, often fatal sickness called Reye's syndrome in young people 
recovering from chicken pox or the flu.</p> 
<p>The syndrome can cause brain damage and death. Because of the risks, 
aspirin makers are required by law to add warning labels about Reye's syndrome 
to product packages.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>..Aspirin Alternatives</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you're one of the people who can't take aspirin, there are alternatives.
</p> 
<p>The most popular is acetaminophen, sold under the brand-names Tylenol and 
Datril (among others). Acetaminophen reduces fever and pain, but doesn't ease 
inflammation. On the other hand, acetaminophen causes less stomach upset.</p> 
<p>Ibuprofen, sold under the brand-names Advil and Nuprin, was introduced as a 
nonprescription pain reliever in 1984. It works like aspirin to block both 
fever and swelling and may work better against certain types of pain, like 
menstrual cramps.</p> 
<p>But even aspirin alternatives aren't entirely safe.</p> 
<p>Both can cause overdose -- and, in recent years, each has surpassed aspirin 
as a cause of hospitalization. And both acetaminophen and ibuprofen appear to 
damage kidneys with regular use.</p> 
<p>Some reports have even linked ibuprofen to a reversible, temporary form of 
kidney failure in as many as a quarter of patients studied.</p> 
<p>Should none of these over-the-counter drugs satisfactorily reduce 
discomfort, pain may be a sign of a more serious problem warranting a doctor's 
attention. For more severe pain, a physician can prescribe other preparations, 
including narcotics and synthetic pain relievers.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>..Consumer, Be Wise</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Pointing out its possible risks isn't meant to turn people away from 
moderate aspirin use.</p> 
<p>Aspirin really is a wonder drug -- as effective at stopping pain as many 
prescription analgesics,<br>
 and its beneficial effects on health only make it 
that much more of a boon than it has been all along.</p> 
<p>Just about the only thing aspirin lacks is the &quot;magic&quot; that 
occurs when a doctor writes a prescription for an expensive prescription drug. 
This &quot;magic&quot; relieves pain about half the time -- even when the 
contents of the capsule are only sugar.</p> 
<p>But unlike the &quot;magic&quot; of placebos, the magic of aspirin resides 
in the aspirin molecule itself. And all aspirin is alike. It has to be to be 
aspirin.</p> 
<p>No matter what some brand-name aspirin makers say in their TV ads, there's 
no real difference between brand-name and no-name aspirin. When you buy 
expensive brands, the extra money pays for advertising -- not 
&quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot; pain relief.</p> 
<p>Aspirin is aspirin, and it works and it's safe -- if you're careful -- 
whether it costs 99 cents or $9.99.</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>..Sidebar | Rx for the Heart</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>After a century on the job, aspirin's still working wonders -- and in 
wondrous new ways.<br>
 Beyond its role as a pain reliever, aspirin is showing 
value in preventing ischemic (clotting) strokes and in slowing the formation of 
cataracts.</p> 
<p>Perhaps even more important is the drug's role in preventing heart attack 
by slowing development of blood clots in arteries leading to the heart.</p> 
<p>Researchers at Harvard Medical School concluded a six-year study by saying 
that healthy men over age 50 can cut their heart attack risk in half by taking 
a single aspirin, every other day.</p> 
<p>But don't head for the medicine cabinet just yet. Head to the doctor, if 
you think you might benefit. And even then, you should be aware of two key 
points:</p> 
<p>More is not better. There's no evidence that gulping more aspirin more 
often will improve your chances of avoiding a heart attack.</p> 
<p>Aspirin is not a substitute for other preventive measures, such as losing 
weight and stopping smoking.</p> 
<p>In addition, regular aspirin use may increase risks of bleeding stroke, 
which is more often fatal than ischemic stroke.</p> 
<p>Best advice? Check with your doctor to see if benefits outweigh possible 
risks in your case. The alternative can be every bit as deadly as a heart 
attack. </p> </blockquote> <br>
