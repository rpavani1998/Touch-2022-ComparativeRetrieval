<h1>Fever</h1> 
<p><strong></strong>Fever (also called pyrexia) is defined as body temperature 
that is higher than normal for each individual. It generally indicates that 
there is an abnormal process going on within the body.</p> 
<p>Fever is not the illness itself, but is a symptom or an indicator that 
something is not right within the body. The fever does not tell you what 
disorder is causing it, or even that a disease process is occurring. It may be 
a bacterial or viral infection, or simply a reaction from an allergy, or 
becoming overheated at play or in the sun.</p> 
<p>Fevers may be treated in a manner previously discussed with your child's 
physician during well-care checkups. But, call the doctor anytime you are not 
comfortable with your child's condition, and certainly for any fever that 
spikes rapidly or persists despite treatment.</p> 
<h3>Questions about Fevers</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>What constitutes a fever?</li> 
<li>What are the signs that indicate fever?</li> 
<li>How do I take the temperature?</li> 
<li>What are the treatment options?</li> </ul> 
<h3>Answers</h3> 
<dl> 
<dt> What constitutes a fever? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p><strong></strong>How high the fever is may not be a good indication of how 
mild or severe the disorder is. For example, influenza may cause a fever of 
104, while pneumonia may cause a very low-grade fever or no fever at all.</p> 
<p>Although high fevers may bring on convulsions or delirium, generally it is 
not how high the fever is, but how rapidly the temperature rose that causes a 
convulsion.</p> 
<p><strong>If symptoms of an illness are present: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>a temperature between 99.8oF - 100.8oF is considered a low-grade fever.
</li> 
<li>a temperature between 101oF - 102oF is considered a mild fever.</li> 
<li>between 102oF - 103oF is considered a moderate fever.</li> 
<li>anything around 104oF or above is considered a high fever, and delirium or 
convulsions may occur.</li> </ul> 
<p>Your child's physician may have different definitions of fever than these, 
and will provide guidelines for when to treat fever yourself and when to call 
the physician's office.</p> Back to Top <br>

<dt> What are the signs that indicate fever? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p><strong></strong>Because a baby or young child may not be able to express 
how he or she is feeling, parents may look for signs -- outward indications -- 
that fever is present before using a thermometer. Signs that indicate that 
fever in very young children include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>flushed face</li> 
<li>hot, dry skin</li> 
<li>low output of urine, and/or dark urine</li> 
<li>not interested in eating</li> 
<li>constipation or diarrhea</li> 
<li>vomiting</li> </ul> 
<p>Symptoms, specific indications an older child may be able to describe, 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>headache</li> 
<li>aching all over</li> 
<li>nausea (sometimes vomiting)</li> 
<li>constipation (sometimes diarrhea)</li> </ul> Back to Top <br>
</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> How do I take the temperature? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p><strong></strong>When your child appears to have a fever, it is best to 
take his/her temperature with:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a rectal thermometer for an infant or young child</li> 
<li>an oral thermometer for an older child or teenager</li> 
<li>an ear thermometer for children older than one year (the ear canal in 
babies is too small to get a proper reading)</li> </ul> 
<p>Taking a temperature reading with a thermometer directly touching certain 
areas of the skin, such as under the armpit or in the bend of the elbow, is not 
recommended because it is not considered to be reliable.</p> Back to Top <br>

<dt> What are the treatment options? </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Once you have determined that your child does have fever, you may treat it 
in a manner that you have previously discussed with the child's physician.</p> 
<p>DO NOT GIVE ASPIRIN to a child who has fever without first contacting the 
child's physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for viral fevers in 
children, has been associated with Reye's syndrome, a potentially serious or 
deadly disorder in children. Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare 
providers recommend that aspirin not be used to treat any fever in children.</p>
<p> To safely reduce fever in children, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen 
products. And, be sure to consult your child's physician for any fever that 
spikes rapidly or resists treatment. A tepid bath (water that is neither too 
cool or too warm to the touch) may reduce the fever, as well as comfort the 
child. Alcohol rub downs are no longer recommended, at least for younger 
children.</p> 
<p>Trust your instincts and call the child's physician for guidance anytime 
you are uncomfortable with your child's condition, and remember that the 
child's physician should be contacted for any fever that spikes rapidly or 
persists despite treatment.</p> Back to Top <br>
