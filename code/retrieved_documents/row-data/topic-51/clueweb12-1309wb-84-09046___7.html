milk is good for the baby.</li> 
<li><strong>The symptoms for all flu are similar.</strong> However, be on the

<h2>Antiviral Medications for Treatment </h2> 
<p>If your child gets sick, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and 
make him or her feel better faster. They may also prevent serious influenza 
complications. Most people do not need these antiviral drugs to fully recover 
from the flu.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Children younger than 5 years old and children with chronic medical 
conditions, such asasthma and diabetes , might benefit from antiviral 
medications. Ask the doctor about any special treatment requirements.</li> 
<li>Even if the child is feeling a little better, he or she should continue 
taking antiviral medication as directed by the doctor.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Guidance on Breastfeeding</h2> 
<p>Mothers who are breastfeeding should continue to nurse their babies while 
being treated for the flu. Breast milk passes on antibodies from the mother to 
a baby. Antibodies help fight off infection.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If possible, only adults who are not sick should care for infants, 
including providing feedings.</li> 
<li>If you are too sick to breastfeed, pump and have someone give your milk to 
your baby.</li> 
<li>Be careful not to cough or sneeze in the baby&rsquo;s face; wash your 
hands often with soap and water.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Symptoms</h2> 
<p>It is important to watch for any signs that your child doesn&rsquo;t feel 
well and to pay attention to any unusual behavior. Although the symptoms for 
all flu are similar, infants could have a fever or be lethargic, but may not 
have a cough or other respiratory symptoms.</p> 
<p>All types of flu can cause:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fever</li> 
<li>Coughing and/or sore throat</li> 
<li>Runny or stuffy nose</li> 
<li>Headaches and/or body aches</li> 
<li>Chills</li> 
<li>Fatigue</li> </ul> 
<h2>What to Do If Your Child Gets Sick</h2> 
<p>Call your doctor right away if your child gets sick. Antiviral medications 
used to treat flu in some patients work best when started within the first 2 
days (48 hours) of getting sick.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The doctor may start your child on antiviral drugs even after 48 hours 
when symptoms began, especially if the child has been hospitalized or is at 
high risk for flu-related complications.</li> 
<li>Children younger than 5 years old and children with chronic medical 
conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, may be at higher risk for 
complications from flu. Check with your doctor about any special treatment 
requirements for them.</li> 
<li>Some over-the-counter medicines  are approved for children to use to 
relieve flu symptoms.</li> 
<li>If your child has a fever, use fever-reducing medicines that your doctor 
recommends based on your child&rsquo;s age.</li> 
<li>A fever is a temperature taken with a thermometer that is equal to or 
greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius). If you are not able 
to measure a temperature, the child might have a fever if he or she feels warm, 
has a flushed appearance, or is sweating or shivering.</li> 
<li><strong>Keep your sick child home until at least 24 hours after the child 
no longer has a fever or signs of a fever (100&deg;F or 37.8&deg;C) (without 
the use of a fever-reducing medicine, such as Tylenol&reg;)</strong>. </li> 
<li>Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and drinks clear fluids (such as 
water, broth, sports drinks, electrolyte beverages for infants, Pedialyte&reg;) 
to keep from being dehydrated.</li> 
<li>Keep your sick child in a separate room in the house as much as possible 
to limit contact with household members who are not sick.</li> 
<li>Consider having just one person be the main caregiver for the sick child. 
</li> 
<li>You can consider sending your child back to school after at least 24 hours 
has passed since his or her temperature returned to normal WITHOUT the use of 
medications.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Over-the-Counter Medication Guidance</h2> 
<p>Your child or teen will probably feel miserable with body aches, sore 
throat, and other symptoms of the flu. Taking certain over-the-counter 
medicines can help relieve their flu symptoms. A doctor will decide if 
antiviral medications are necessary.</p> 
<p>Call the doctor&rsquo;s office if your child experiences any side effects, 
such as nausea, vomiting, rash, or unusual behavior. SeeCaring for Someone Sick 
at Home  for more details.</p> Patient Age DOs DON&rsquo;Ts <br>

Children/teenagers 5 &acirc;&#128;&#147; 18 years old DO take acetaminophen 
(Tylenol&reg;) or ibuprofen (Advil&reg;, Motrin&reg;, Nuprin&reg;), to relieve 
symptoms. They do not contain aspirin.<br>
 DO Check ingredient labels on 
over-the-counter cold and flu medications to see if they contain aspirin. 
DON&rsquo;T take aspirin or products that contain aspirin (e.g. 
Pepto-Bismol&reg;). This can cause a rare but serious illness called 
Reye&rsquo;s syndrome. <br>
Children younger than 4 years of age DO ask your 
doctor before using over-the-counter medications (e.g. Children&rsquo;s 
Tylenol&reg;, Children&rsquo;s Motrin&reg;).<br>
 DO follow the doctor&rsquo;s 
instructions exactly to avoid dosing errors. DON&rsquo;T give children 
over-the-counter cough and cold drugs containing antihistamines to help them 
sleep. <br>
Children younger than 2 years of age DO use a cool-mist humidifier 
and a suction bulb to help clear away mucus.<br>
 DO follow the doctor&rsquo;s 
instructions for care. DON&rsquo;T give over-the-counter cough and cold drugs 
to children younger than 2 years old. <br>
