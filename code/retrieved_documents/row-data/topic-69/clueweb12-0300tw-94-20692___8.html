<p>Celebs gathered in Las Vegas this past Saturday night to celebrate the life 
and legacy of boxer Muhammad Ali at the 16th annualKeep Memory Alive 
&ldquo;Power of Love Gala.&quot;<br>
</p> 
<p>The GM Grand Garden Arena was transformed into a 70th birthday celebration 
for Ali designed to honor the boxing legend&rsquo;s contribution to the world 
and raise awareness and money for Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Huntington&rsquo;s, ALS, 
Multiple Sclerosis and of course Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, which &ldquo;The 
Champ&rdquo; has been battling since 1984.</p> 
<p>The 5-hour birthday bash included performances by Stevie Wonder, Cee-Lo 
Green, Lenny Kravitz, Snoop Dogg, John Legend, Kelly Rowland and LL Cool J, who 
appropriately rapped &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out.&quot;</p> 
<p>President Obama even made an appearance via a heartfelt video message:<br>

</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;Happy birthday, champ. As a fighter, you were something spectacular. 
You shocked the world, and you inspired it, too. And even after all the titles 
and legendary bouts, you're still doing it.&quot;</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>And he certainly inspired some big spenders during the event. A pair of 
Ali's boxing gloves he used to defeat Floyd Patterson in 1965 were auctioned 
for a whooping $1.1 million. Who shelled out the cash? Lorenzo Fertitta, a 
casino owner and owner of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the mixed marital 
arts league.</p> 
<p>One of our favorite jewelry companies, Lagos, also contributed to the 
amazing cause. Owner Steven Lagos designed a stunning one-of-a-kind cuff and 
earring set in 18k gold and diamonds which sold for $30,000.</p> 
<p>The awesome event will be aired on ABC Saturday, February 25, at 7 p.m. EST 
(4 p.m. PST). But check out the slideshow below for a sneak peek!<br>
