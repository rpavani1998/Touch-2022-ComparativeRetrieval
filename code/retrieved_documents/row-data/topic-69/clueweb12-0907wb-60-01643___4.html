<h1>Muhammad Ali, one of the best boxers ever.</h1> <br>
<br>
<b>Muhammad Ali
</b>  Date:&nbsp; Sat, 1942-01-17 <br>

<p> *On this dates Registry we mark the birth of Muhammad Ali in 1942. He was 
an African-American professional boxer, the first boxer to win the heavyweight 
championship three separate times.</p> 
<p>He is also an international humanitarian and ambassador of good will. 
Cassius Marcellus Clay (his name at birth) is from Louisville, Kentucky. As an 
amateur boxer, he was noticed in 1960 by winning the Amateur Athletic Union 
light heavyweight and Golden Gloves heavyweight championships. He won a gold 
medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Olympic games in Rome. He 
turned professional soon afterward and became world heavyweight champion by 
knocking out Sonny Liston in seven rounds in 1964.</p> 
<p>Gifted with unusually fast reflexes, excellent hand-leg coordination, and 
finely honed defensive skills, Ali successfully defended his title nine times 
from 1965 to 1967 and was universally recognized as champion after out pointing 
World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Ernie Terrell in 15 rounds in 1967. Ali 
often proclaimed his invincibility in poetic verse and made the claim &quot;I 
am the greatest!&quot; his personal slogan. In 1964 he joined the Nation of 
Islam adopting a Muslim name and in 1967 he refused, on religious grounds, to 
submit to induction into the armed forces. He was subsequently convicted of 
violating the Selective Service Act and in consequence barred from the ring and 
stripped of his title.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately reversed this conviction in 1971. Ali had 
meanwhile resumed boxing in 1970 and had defeated two other title contenders, 
but in 1971, he lost a 15-round decision to the heavyweight champion, Joe 
Frazier. For nearly three years Ali fought other title contenders, including 
Jerry Quarry, Floyd Patterson, Joe Bugner, and Ken Norton. Finally Ali won a 
unanimous decision over Frazier in 1974 that led to his meeting with the new 
champion, George Foreman, later that year. His eighth-round knockout of Foreman 
regained for Ali the undisputed world heavyweight title. After defending his 
title successfully six times, he lost it to Leon Spinks in 1978, in a split 
decision.</p> 
<p>Ali regained the WBA title from Spinks seven months later, thus becoming 
the first boxer to win the heavyweight championship three times. In 1979 he 
announced his retirement, at that point having lost only three decisions in 59 
fights. He returned to fight World Boxing Council champion Larry Holmes in 1980 
and Trevor Berbick of Canada in 1981 but lost both fights. In 1984 it was 
confirmed that Ali was suffering from a series of symptoms variously known as 
&quot;punch drunk&quot; syndrome, or chronic hazard of boxing; it is 
characterized by Parkinson-like symptoms; slurred speech, facial immobility, 
poor balance, and difficulty in walking.</p> 
<p>He has since maintained a commitment to helping various community service 
causes around the world. Ali was selected to light the Olympic flame at the 
1996 Games in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
