<p> Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier <br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Frazier and Muhammad Ali&nbsp; <br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Boxing World Mourns Its Soul of Sport: the pugilist known as 
Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier</strong><br>
<br>
How ironic the death of boxing 
great Joe Frazier&nbsp; was reported during a nationally televised Monday Night 
football game with his home town Philadelphia Eagles succumbing to the Chicago 
Bears with their playoff hopes at stake. One could say that without Joe 
Frazier, the Eagles had no punch left.<br>
<br>
Muhummad Ali will forever be 
considered the media darling and the glitter of the sport of boxing, but 
&lsquo;Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier was the soul of the sport. One could argue 
that Ali would not have become the world icon that he is today without Joe 
Frazier.<br>
<br>
Born in Beaufort, S.C., on Jan. 12, 1944, Frazier took up 
boxing early after watching weekly fights on the black and white television on 
his family&rsquo;s small farm. He was a top amateur for several years, and 
became the only American fighter to win a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics in 
Tokyo despite fighting in the final bout with an injured left thumb. He died on 
Monday Nov, 7th after a bout with liver cancer.<br>
<br>
As news of his death 
spread like a forest fire, the boxing community took to social media to display 
their affection to a man who never got the respect that he rightfully deserved 
while alive.<br>
<br>
However, his death on Monday night has touched millions, 
including a deep admirer of the sport's history, unbeaten world welterweight 
champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.<br>
<br>
On Twitter late Tuesday after hearing of 
Frazier's death, Mayweather tweeted, &quot;My condolences go out to the family 
of the late great Joe Frazier. The Money Team will pay for his funeral 
services.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayweather has committed to such a gesture before, 
earlier this year paying for the funeral of a one-time opponent, Southland 
former world champion, Genaro Hernandez.<br>
<br>
Frazier had struggled 
financially after his boxing career ended.<br>
<br>
He made public appearances 
to earn income, such as one just this summer at Saratoga Race Track in New York 
to commemorate the 40-year anniversary of the first fight in his epic trilogy 
against Muhammad Ali. Those who were there were concerned by how frail Frazier 
looked. On Saturday, word came that he was receiving hospice care &ndash; near 
death. His last such public appearance was at Mayweather's last fight at the 
MGM Grand in Las Vegas.<br>
<br>
Frazier won the 1971 bout &ndash; called the 
&lsquo;Fight of the Century&rsquo; &ndash; at Madison Square Garden in New 
York, with an estimated 300 million watching at closed-circuit venues, 
according to his manager. The loss was Ali's first, as Frazier knocked him down 
in the 15th round with his signature left hook and won by decision.<br>
<br>
He 
lost a decision to the skilled Ali in the rematch, and then the pair engaged in 
a war for the ages, the &lsquo;Thrilla in Manila,&rsquo; in 1975.<br>
<br>

Legendary promoter Don King, who promoted Joe Frazier in the finale of 
Frazier&rsquo;s phenomenal trilogy with Muhammad Ali, 1975&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Thrilla in Manila,&rsquo; made the following statement from his South 
Florida home after learning last night of the death of his longtime friend: 
&ldquo;Smokin&rsquo; Joe Frazier was the embodiment of what a great heavyweight 
champion and person should be.&nbsp; He was a great gladiator.&nbsp; When 
Smokin&rsquo; Joe came to the ring, you knew you had someone who was coming to 
fight.&nbsp; I was proud to have known and promoted him, and I was honored to 
call him a friend. The courage Smokin' Joe showed in &quot;the &lsquo;Thrilla 
in Manila&rsquo;&mdash;answering every Ali onslaught with an equally withering 
response&mdash;will remain in the hearts and minds of boxing fans around the 
globe forever.&nbsp; It was one of the most dramatic fights in history.&nbsp; 
Although the warrior inside Smokin' Joe wanted to answer the bell for the 15th 
and final round, his chief second and friend, Eddie Futch, acted as more than a 
corner man to step in, and refuse to let him continue, so that he could live to 
fight another day, and smoke 'em some more.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;One cannot 
underestimate the contribution Smokin' Joe and Ali made to progress and change 
by creating the space, through their talent, for Black men to be seen, visible 
and relevant.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Thrilla in Manila&rsquo; helped make America 
better. &ldquo;Not only was he a great fighter but also a great man. He lived 
as he fought with courage and commitment at a time when African Americans in 
all spheres of life were engaged in a struggle for emancipation and 
respect.&nbsp; Smokin' Joe brought honor, dignity and pride for his people, the 
American people, and brought the nation together as only sports can do.&rdquo;
<br><br>
 &quot;This was it for both of them, the end of the world, a war that 
neither could lose,&quot; the fight's co-promoter, Bob Arum, said. &quot;Ali 
didn't let on that he was nervous. But I know Ali. He was nervous. There was so 
much tension in both of those camps. You can't believe it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arum, 
who will be promoting Manny Pacquiao&rsquo;s mega fight on Saturday in Las 
Vegas, told the Sentinel; &ldquo;Joe was a great guy and proud warrior. Even 
though I was affiliated with the Ali camp, Joe always treated me with kindness 
and I really appreciated that.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Manny Pacquiao offered, 
&ldquo;Boxing lost a great champion, and the sport lost a great 
ambassador.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mike Tyson, who, more than any other fighter, 
fought similar to Frazier, issued a statement &ndash; calling Joe's passing a 
&quot;sad day&quot; ... but saying &ldquo;we should honor him by celebrating 
his accomplishments.&quot; Tyson went to Twitter and wrote, &quot;Frazier and 
Ali were quintessential, the apex of pedigree fighting in which each man would 
not give an inch until they were dead. Their era was competitive fighting at 
the highest level.&quot; He added, &quot;As a young fighter it has always been 
an honor to be compared to Frazier. My family and I are sending our sincerest 
condolences to the Joe Frazier family.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Frazier&rsquo;s 
nemesis, Ali, issued&nbsp; a statement saying &quot;The world has lost a great 
champion. I will always remember Joe with respect and admiration,&quot; said 
Ali, 69. &ldquo;My sympathy goes out to his family and loved ones.&rdquo;<br>

George Foreman&rsquo;s longtime publicist Bill Kaplan said; &ldquo;He was a 
very fun guy and he was a great fighter. The first fight with Ali, at the time 
it was considered to be the biggest fight promotion of all time and it probably 
still is. Ali and Frazier were both undefeated, Ali had been on a forced hiatus 
for three-and-a-half years, and while he was gone, Joe became what we knew as 
the undisputed heavyweight champion.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 British promoter Frank 
Warren added, &ldquo;He was part of that era of the best heavyweights there 
have ever been. The trilogy of fights that he had with Muhammad Ali, the tough 
fight he had with George Foreman and the good wins on the way &ndash; he was 
one of the most exciting heavyweights ever. People talk about Mike Tyson at the 
age of 21 &ndash; Joe Frazier, when he was a young fella, was every bit (as 
good as), if not better than, Mike Tyson.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Frazier&rsquo;s 
business manager Leslie Wolff reflected, &ldquo;If you look into the history of 
what took place, there is a lot of emotion. When you have a legend, people 
respond to a legend.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Fellow Russian heavyweight 
champions, Vladimir and Vitali Klitschko, issued a statement; &ldquo;He was a 
huge fighter, huge champion, huge personality. I didn't have a chance to see 
his fights live, because in 1971&hellip;the Soviet Union professional boxing 
was forbidden.&nbsp; But we studied and listened about this fighter a lot, and 
after that, we had a chance to see the fights. It was a great lesson for all 
new generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Legendary fighter Bernard 
Hopkins added; &ldquo;About two or three years ago, everybody was asking me why 
I was fighting. Joe Frazier said you fight as long as you feel you can do it 
and win with dignity. That was in Joe. I was at Hand's Gym while I was in 
Philly. I told him I could and that I was in great shape. He walked out of the 
place. I remember that. Those few minutes were like an hour. You've got to 
listen to him and listen to him clearly.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The words for Joe 
Frazier this week were much like his signature punches, in relentless great 
volume, but sadly, he is not here to appreciate them.</p>
