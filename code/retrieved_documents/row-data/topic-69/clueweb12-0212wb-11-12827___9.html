<h1>Philippine Regalo Padala</h1> April 24, 2008 <br>
 by: admin <br>
 &nbsp; 
<p>This is one of the great opportunity for OFW families or loved ones in the 
Philippines to have a memorable gift on those special occasions besides the 
usual money remittances. First of all lets talk about the logistics or courier 
providers. Money remittance centers have sprouted all over the Philippines and 
became popular because of Pinoys sending their earnings back home. I for one 
have tried most of the services and the money I sent was instant. It 
wasn&rsquo;t long ago that remittances used to take 3-5 days to reach its 
destination, but thanks to the growing number of pick up points in the 
Philippines such as banks, jewelry outlets, stores and malls and don&rsquo;t 
forget the modernization of the internet too. It has been noted by the Central 
Bank of the Philippines that as of present, foreign remittance from Overseas 
Filipinos have remitted and surpassed the 15 billion peso mark even though the 
exchange rate of the US Dollar has weakened. The Pinoy padala has not been 
bothered with it and their continuous support for their families back home even 
grew. Online services have popped up the scene and the affiliates of media 
giant ABS-CBN even joined the bandwagon for both remittance and box. For money 
remittances the most popular right now are as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Western Union</li> 
<li>Xoom</li> 
<li>Money Gram</li> </ul> 
<p>Sending cargo boxes or most popular as balikbayan boxes of gifts, personal 
effects, clothes, canned goods or even electronic items have become a 
phenomenon too. Filipinos overseas loves their family a lot and most, if had a 
chance, would love to share all the things they have through sending boxes of 
goods in the Philippines. These logistic providers have come up with this 
ingenious way of providing Filipino families back home with this kind of 
support and can be also be delivered to any destination in the country. In our 
experience we have sent a box of canned goods, clothes, fragrances, juices, 
chocolates and other imported items that we can share. Very interesting indeed. 
Some of the popular logistic companies here in the US are as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Forex</li> 
<li>LBC</li> 
<li>StarKargo</li> </ul> 
<p>As for online gift sending we have seen a lot and used a few of them. These 
are services for bulky products such as appliances or electronics, furnitures, 
packaged good items, jewelries and computers. Most of them are specialized on 
sending flowers which are good for special occasions and loved ones in the 
Philippines. It really is a convenient way also of sending a gift through 
internet payments. A lot of these online services pops up on keyword terms such 
as Philippine Gifts, Philippine Regalo, Philippine Pasalubong, Philippine On 
Line Gifts and many more. The services we used so far and have a prompt 
delivery are the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>MyAyala.com</li> 
<li>22Ban.com</li> </ul>

<h1>Malls in the Philippines</h1> April 23, 2008 <br>
 by: admin <br>
 &nbsp; 
<p>A way to spend some good time strolling around. Malls in the Philippines 
are conveniently and strategically located around Metro Manila and some cities 
in the provinces. There are so many of them that got merged, reorganized, 
renovated and constructed in a rapid pace to provide easy access to local and 
nearby residents. Most of them have complete facilities from food courts to 
fashion stores and from department stores to skating rinks, totally built 
essentially to attract visitors. While there are the ones that in the new term 
as &ldquo;high tech&rdquo; malls there are a few malls that are venues as 
bargain centers or wholesale markets. It is very hard to track an update to all 
of them as they provide different venues and offers a variety of market sales.
</p> 
<p>Though the malls continue to pop up at a rapid scale, many and mostly the 
new generations knew about its history. The SM Mall chain for example started 
as shoe department store in the late 50&rsquo;s in Quiapo, Manila and was 
called Shoemart, selling various type and styles of local shoes that were made 
mostly from Marikina. The store became a success that saw the rise of branches 
in T.M Kalaw in Ermita, Cubao and in various parts of Metro Manila and in 1994 
grew to be the largest mall chain in the Philippines. But the first real mall 
was constructed in the early months of 1976 and also was finished at the same 
year, The Ali Mall. Ali Mall was the very first mall constructed and named 
after the popular legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who fought with Joe Frazier in 
the &ldquo;Thrilla in Manila&rdquo; bout. Ali Mall was built in the center of 
Cubao and nearby the Farmers Market, the COD Department Store, Rustans 
Department Store, Araneta Coliseum and the Fiesta Carnival. Renovated now with 
new modern facilities added, it is now called the Araneta Center, still owned 
and manged by the Araneta Family.</p> 
<p>Since then, many malls have been constructed all over the Philippines and 
the local citizens frequent the place to shop or stroll around especially in 
the weekends and during summertime to cool them down in these air conditioned 
places. Below are a few list of some of the popular malls in the Philippines.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ayala Center</li> 
<li>Araneta Center</li> 
<li>Glorietta</li> 
<li>Greenhills Shopping Center</li> 
<li>Robinsons</li> 
<li>Shangrila Mall</li> 
<li>SM Malls</li> 
<li>Harrison Plaza</li> 
<li>Mall of Asia</li> 
<li>Tutuban Center</li> </ul>

<h1>Nutriban</h1> April 15, 2008 <br>
 by: admin <br>
 &nbsp; 
<p><strong>Nutribun</strong> - Nutrition Bun pronounced locally as Nutriban.
</p> 
<p>Not so many folks remembers this supplemental food (bread) in the 
Philippines. As a matter of fact the new generations have never heard of it and 
I have to look if there are certain good articles about this topic in which I 
have found bits and pieces but no actual definition. Only those who were born 
in the early 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, went to public school, have heard or 
tasted this bread. I&rsquo;m very happy as<strong>Wikipedia</strong> writers 
have not even discovered this at all including the young bloggers of the 
Philippines as well and Paraiso could be the first to give some information, if 
not.</p> 
<p><strong>So what is Nutriban ?</strong></p> 
<p>Nutriban bread was introduced in the Philippines during the early seventies 
at public schools to supplement nutrition. It was a donation mainly from the 
United States mainly with some coming from Australia, Canada, France and the 
United Kingdom. That was during the heightened food and gas crisis that 
occurred in the early 70&rsquo;s in the Philippines. Nutriban is similar to the 
local &ldquo;monay bread&rdquo; but bigger, most likely as twice or thrice to 
its present size and has a real solid make, unlike the pan de sal and other 
local breads full of air inside. Made up of ingredients such as wheat, baking 
powder, corn starch, flour and milk. A real nutritional bun, it taste good with 
any fillings but most prefer with margarine, peanut butter or coconut jam.</p> 
<p>It was originally delivered to the Philippines as a food aide to help with 
nutrition, with hundred thousands of metric tons stored all over government 
storage facilities, later sent to public schools for free consumption at first. 
To generate funds for local public school activities, it was later sold at 5 
centimo when the price of pan-de-sal was 15 centimo per piece. Not a bad price 
at all considering its enormous size 4 times compared with pan-de-sal, with its 
nutritional ingredients. As the supply of Nutriban slowly depleted in 1976, 
only a few public schools in Metro Manila and in the rural areas continued to 
serve the bread. In 1977 it totally lost its supplies.</p> 
<p>No one in the bread making business dared to copy its ingredient for mass 
consumption since most of its contents are expensive and selling it to the 
public at a price lower than the popular breads is losing money. Thus Nutriban 
became extinct but people still remember it as one of the best cheap bread 
served in the country.</p> 
<p>I hope the government could find a way to revive this bread as it could 
help millions of Filipinos alternatively finding supplements for the hiking 
cost of bread in the Philippines. If anyone has more info about this topic 
please fell free to contribute by sending it to me or just place it at the 
comments box and I would surely review it and place the proper credit. So 
don&rsquo;t forget to write your name. It&rsquo;s a good topic that needs more 
info aimed at the Baby Boomers in the Philippines and a good contribution to 
the young generations.</p>

<h1>Local Rides in The Philippines</h1> April 12, 2008 <br>
 by: admin <br>
 
&nbsp; 
<p><strong>The Kalesa</strong> is one of the oldest means of transportation in 
the Philippines. It is an inclined cart with 2 big wheels at the rear and has 2 
rows of seats, with a solo seat on the front row for the driver or in local 
language as &ldquo;<strong>Kutchero</strong>&rdquo; who handles the horse. 
Introduced first by the Spaniards in the late 17th Century, for use by noble 
families and high ranking officials of the colonizing government of Spain. The 
Kalesa is very rare to spot in the streets nowadays but it is still being used 
as a means of public transportation in some districts in Metro Manila, 
especially in Divisoria, Binondo, Intramuros, Mandaluyong near marketplaces and 
a few rural places around the country. They are commonly seen in the Luneta 
area for tourists to take a ride around for better viewing of the scenery.
<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>The Pedicab</strong>, known in English as cycle rickshaws and 
locally as padyak. The Pedicab are used mainly on smaller streets or in the 
inner districts of Metro Manila. It is a bicycle with a sidecar carrier for 
passengers of 2 or 3. This mode of transportation is also a popular ride in 
other parts of Asia as well as in some countries around the globe. It is also 
used for nearby deliveries of goods and are efficient in saving gasoline while 
good for the health as it riding a bicycle is a form of exercise. Why not earn 
some bucks while exercising.</p> 
<p><strong>The Tricycle</strong> is an upgraded version of the Pedicab. 
Besides the sidecar carrier which can accommodate 2 passengers, the motorcycle 
itself can have 2 or more passengers riding on it. As of now it is considered 
as one of the popular transportation in the the smaller parts streets and inner 
districts of Metro Manila and city provinces as well as rural areas around the 
Philippines. Trip fares have a minimum amount and additional pay depends on 
succeeding kilometers. An efficient way of transporting people and goods, the 
tricycle, can be seen all over the city with wonderful colors and design.</p> 
<p><strong>The Jeepney</strong> is the most popular amongst all public 
transportation in the Philippines. The jeepney originated from World War II, 
used by the G.I&rsquo;s as military transport. It also became as part of the 
national culture of the country as it became the symbol of local transportation 
for its population. It&rsquo;s popularity became known worldwide in the early 
70&rsquo;s for its colorful designs, upgrades and modifications. Most run on 
diesel fuel and are produced all over the country by independently owned 
workshops and factories within the Philippines.</p>

<h1>Philippine Eagle - Protect The Agila</h1> April 10, 2008 <br>
 by: admin 
<br>  &nbsp; 
<p>Very few lobbies for the protection of the environment in the Philippines. 
Not much of our country men are aware of the dangers and effects, even the 
extinction of animals especially the Philippine Eagle.</p> 
<p>The Philippine Eagle, in its scientific name as Pithecophaga jefferyi, is 
considered the largest and most powerful in the breed of eagles around the 
world and most commonly referred to as the King of Birds. In its local language 
translation of King of Birds as Haring Ibon, some refers to it as Haring Agila 
but to the local population we just simply know it as Agila. The Agila is our 
national bird and since its very rare of its species, it can be found only in 
the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.</p> 
<p>This rare bird has a long life. A captive bird in a Rome Zoo was received 
as a full grown in 1934 and died in 1976, making it at least 41 years old at 
death. A baby male eagle arrived at the Philippine Eagle Center in 1969 and its 
still alive as of this moment so its exactly 39 years old now. It is still 
unknown how old eagles get in the wild. But based on the fact that wild birds 
face the many exigencies of the forest environment which is rather absent in 
the captive conditions, wild birds may live shorter than captive birds.</p> 
<p>For more information about the Philippine Eagle, its habitat, conservation, 
ecology, programs and other useful reference you can visit the<strong>
Philippine Eagle Foundation</strong> website at www.philippineeagle.org. You 
can also help the foundation, its mission and the conservation of nature by 
donations.</p> 
<p><strong>Paraiso Philippines</strong> not only caters for travelers alone, 
but to worldwide wildlife enthusiasts, the general public, as well as local 
citizens to heighten their awareness in the preservation of our very own 
natural resources introducing some exotic animals and endangered species and 
use our website as a means of resource while promoting education and media 
effectiveness in introducing the magnificent beauty of the Island of the 
Philippines to the rest of the world.</p>
