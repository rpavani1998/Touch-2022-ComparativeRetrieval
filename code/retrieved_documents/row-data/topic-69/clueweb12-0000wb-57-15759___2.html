grew up on the mean streets of Houston's fifth ward area. As a young kid, he 
was always into trouble. He joined the Job Corp, and his life changed. One of 
the counselors noticed that he was always into fights so he decided that George 
should put all of his energy into something positive. This started his boxing 
career.
