<h3><b>4. My Ali Story:</b></h3> <br>
&nbsp; My husband and young daughter 
Lindsey and myself went to the Boxing Hall Of Fame back in 1990. Canastatota Ny 
is our home town. My daughter was 5 at the time. I grew up watching boxing and 
Ali on our old black and white TV,as did my husband. So needless to say my two 
daughters also fell in love with boxing. We were one of the lucky ones that 
actually had the chance to shake Muhammads hand. We were standing in line as he 
passed with all the secruity around him. My daughter had drawn him a cute litte 
pencil sketch of two boxers and one was sweating heart shaped beads of sweat, 
my daughter Lindsey broke free from us and ran to him with her precious drawing 
in hand,, the secruity pushed her back but when Muhammand saw what was 
happening He took his big hand and wave the secruity aside, He bent down so 
gently and hugged her. I was unaware at the time but a local hobby photographer 
got the shot of her wrapping her tiny arms around his neck! He took the drawing 
from her and Thanked her. Later that day I thought it would be nice if she 
could get his autograph. We approached his limo but it had the windows up and 
once again secruity did their job and pushed us aside, as were we walking away 
I heard the window come down and someone called out to get the little girl! We 
went back and he gave her his autograph. She beamed. To end our very special 
day he was put into a convertable car to ride in the parade and we were 
standing in line watching him go by when I yelled to him Your still Pretty 
Muhammad and he yelled back Your pretty too, then he noticed my daughter by my 
side AGAIN! He told his security to bring her to sit with him in the 
convertable for a few min It was a glorious day and she still talks of it, and 
I still remember the glimmer in his eye and the size of his hand , and the 
feeling that my hand was swallowed in his. Thank You Mr Ali for a most 
wonderful memory and a Very Happy Birthdayto YOU ! <br>

&nbsp; I remember March 8, 1971, The Ali/FrazierI fight at Madison 
Square Garden, I was 11 years old. The next day I read that my hero Muhammad 
Ali, had lost the decision, I could'nt believe it! I remember crying, after I 
saw pictures of his swollen Jaw. Then I saw pictures of Joe Frazier, I suddenly 
realized, that the real winner got robbed of the decision. I remember feeling 
alot better. To me, as a child, and still as an adult Muhammad Ali, will always 
be my hero, and &quot;The Greatest Fighter of all Time&quot;! <br>

&nbsp;  I was about 9 years old 
and lived in Kansas City, Missouri. My younger sister and I attended a Muslim 
daycare center. One morning my father woke me up and told me to hurry and get 
dressed. I quickly got dressed and he and I left to drive by the Muslim Templ. 
Upon our arrival, I got the chance to see Mr. Ali. I'm not sure if it was 
seeing Mr. Ali or seeing him with my dad that made it so special for me but 
whatever it was, that was one of the most special days of my 42 years of life.

&nbsp; I first met the Champ in 
76 in Landover, Md while he was training at the Sheraton for match w/ Jimmy 
Young. I was 10 yrs old and followed everything about the Champ. But when my 
Father took the picture when my brother and I were in front of him my Father 
was so excited to get us in the picture that he cut off the Champ in the 
picture. I was so disappointed when the photos were developed. But years later 
in 86 I met him again in Norfolk, Va and he gave me a signed autographed 
picture and he posed in a few photos w/ me. And those items are my most prized 
possesion that now hangs in my family room. <br>

&nbsp; I was a professional boxer myself for 12 years,so to get to the level 
Ali was at,and to stay a boxing GOD for as long as he did,is just incredible!!! 
Ali to me is more than a boxer,he is an icon for millions of people who dont 
even like this sport. As well as having grace,style,speed,beauty in the ring,he 
also has all these plus more outside the ropes. It has allways been a lifelong 
ambition to meet the great man,shake his hand,hug him,ask Ali everything!!!One 
day prehaps,my dream might come true. You are a true GREAT Ali, all the best.

&nbsp; Having suffered 
depression since childhood, mostly due to been bullied. I look upto Ali as an 
inspiration to make the most of my life and to help others, whom have low self 
esteem, or issues that have impacted on their lives. Ali has made me believe in 
myself, and my ability. I now teach various sports including boxing to 
underprivalidged young people, many whom have been involved in crime. If ever i 
feel down, i think of Ali and the way he leads his life and the warmth he 
generates towards others, and soon my mood lifts and inspires me to make the 
most of my life and to help others. I would just like to say &quot;thank 
you&quot; to Muhammad Ali. <br>

&nbsp; Hi, First of 
all; thank you for the opportunity to tell you how I met Muhammad Ali. My Dad 
took me to see Muhammad when I was approximately 7 years old; during the time 
he was banned from boxing because of his courageous stance on the war. He was 
speaking at Oswego State College and my Father was huge fan of his and he toook 
me with him to hear him talk. I was a little to young to remember everything he 
talked about that day but I do remember how he was so loved by those around him 
and what a great presence he had with the whole audeince at the time. After the 
speech was over he was very gracious and let me on stage so my Dad could take a 
picture of me with him. I still have the picture some 40 years later and will 
treasure it forever!!! I know he has had a tough time the past few years with 
his illness and I hope he will be able to live the rest of his life like he 
always has with dignity and greatness. Thank you for your time and 
consideration!! Would it be possible to get his address for me to send him a 
copy of my picture to him. Thank you again, David Holden, 5315 Heidi Lane, 
Brewerton, NY 13069 <br>

&nbsp; I had the great 
pleasure of meeting &quot;The Greatest&quot; a couple of times, one time very 
personal to me the other time creating some cherished memories I'll for the 
rest of my life. In August of 1988, I'm attending an FOP Corn Roast with my 
dad. This is a small town event with many of the local police. St. Joe Lodge 96 
(still pretty lily white at the time!!). I see an imposing figure sitting by 
himself at a picnic table under the shelter. I recognized him instantly, I 
think I must have been the first. In shock, I said to my dad...&quot;that's 
Muhammad Ali, isn't it?&quot; &quot;It sure looks like him.&quot; Brave guy 
that I am, and I don't remember much, it is him!!! I ask him, &quot;How's it 
goin' CHAMP?&quot; I think there was a little small talk. I'm talkin' to Ali!!! 
He asked me if I wanted an Autograph. He asked me!! All of today's pompous 
athletes should take a lesson from this mans humility and humanity. From all 
the brash bravado, he still deeply cherished his fans and cared and loved all 
of humanity. The &quot;Islam for Non-Muslams&quot; pamphlet he gave me will 
always be cherished. I read it and I hope it gives me a better understanding of 
all of the complexities in the world today. A few years later, I was lucky 
enough to have his picture taken holding my 18 month old son. He's 17 now. I 
think he finally realizes how impressive this is!! I finally have a place to 
display my auto'ed gloves and SI's. You are a great human being. People who 
mistook the TV image for real missed out. Were you arrogant? You had the right 
to be, you were the greatest and you backed it up. If they ever met you in 
person, they would see a kind, loving, giving individual who had the time for 
anyone. There is not an athlete today who will have the influence you had. MJ 
comes in second. Today's athlete needs to take a lesson from the greatest and 
realize that without the fans they are nothing. You knew that and that is why, 
even as I am over 50 years old, you will always be an idol. <br>

&nbsp; Just listening to what he had to say, the way he carried 
himself and conducted his life is amazing to me. His messages of believing in 
yourself and standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity have 
inspired me in my life. &quot;I know where I'm going and i know the truth and i 
don't have to be what you want me to be. I'm free to be what I want&quot; -

&nbsp; My Father told me many 
stories of joking, and laughing with Muhammad Ali at Central High School. My 
father is Ill with alzhimers disease. Some of the only memories he has are 
those of &quot;horse playing&quot; with The greatest in the hallways, and 
bathrooms of Central High school. I would love to meet the man of whom my 
father still holds memories. I have recently finished my undergraduate 
education at the University of Louisville, and I am searching to take up my 
masters in architecture, I plan on visiting the center very soon. <br>

&nbsp; i remember as a kid when kids always called me 
Muhammad Ali because my name was Mohammad and i got fed up with it because i 
thought they were teasing me so i went up to a teacher. i was in grade 2 then 
and i told her that this kid jus called me Muhammad Ali. She then told me that 
he was a famous boxer. i started to wander. it was the same year that the movie 
came out. as time passed, i still heard about him and as a kid i always asked 
myself if he was a muslim just like me. i soon found out that he was and was 
proud and in 2007 wen i was in year 8 the movie was on tv. i watched the film 
and was so amazed about why he was so great, i started researching on him and 
he then lifted me up. i was a shy kid, a tall strong kid who always got teased 
by the the others because i was abit taller than the others and fat. the life 
of ali made me have more confidence in myself and better self esteem. Ali then 
became my role model, i bought the film, put posters of him in my room, made a 
movie about him for a school project. every day i wake up looking at my hero 
and thinking that he can do the impossible then i can. he inspires me to be 
myself and to be a good person and to this day he is still my hero <br>

&nbsp; Whilst every generation have their heros and role 
models there has never been anyone who reached so many people like Muhammad 
Ali. Never before has anyone united people of all walks of life and instilled 
so much hope and confidence like Ali. Thank you for being such an inspiration 
to me and for sharing your wonderful life with the world. Your positive 
contribution to this world will be seen for thousands of years to come. <br>

&nbsp; On the 31st May , I was involved in a freak 
accident, where on walking to get my Sunday paper, an elderly gentleman lost 
control of his Jaguar car and mounted the sidewalk and crushed me against a 
wall, where with very serious leg injuries I was trapped for over 30 minutes 
untill be released by the Fire Dept and rushed to Hospital. Here I underwent an 
emergency operation before being transfered to an specialist Hospital, where I 
underwent a further 2 Operations, one lasting over 10 hours, to reconstruct my 
left leg and create skin grafts for both legs....Where does the wonderful 
Muhammad Ali come into all of this....well here we go ! Some 4 years ago I had 
lost my way working too hard , losing my family and children, being very 
selfish...I knew I had to change...I bought a copy of 'Soul of a Butterfly' and 
along with some very stong willpower and help and support, I changed...no more 
alcohol.(Still haven't for over 4 Years) Read and loved every page of such a 
wonderful Book...had I not been as fit and well as I was, the Police and 
Ambulance said I would not have survived, they also commented along with the 
surgeons of my tremendous 'Faith' and will to not only survive but see the good 
in all that had happened, look to each day as a gift, although I will not 
return to my love of Sports Coaching , fully for another 12 months and not walk 
fully again for at least 6 months , if all goes well! During my time in 
Hospital, 'Soul of the Butterfly' was my constant companion, reading and 
meditating Daily over it's wonderful and Spiritual words, this has helped my 
progress and courage beyond words...I have now got hold of a copy of 'More than 
a Hero' by Hana Ali...this too I cherish..I am now back home and although 
unable to get around without help, I now have my laptop and I'm helping many 
Charities and good causes (The World Food Organisation is my favourite !) by 
spreading the word through all the Social Networks I can set up, I also 
treasure my time on The Ali Centre website, and when I next get some wages, I 
will join up and treat myself to a T- Shirt and Baseball Cap...I'm 49 but feel 
24...dear Muhammad your strength and courage against the odds have most 
probably saved my life more than once....I lost the sight in my left eye when I 
was 12 in 1972...due to a sporting accident...was told I wouldn't do sport any 
more...I captained both my School and County at Rugby and Football...it was 
thanks to listening and watching you fight and talk that pushed me to my limits 
and made me fight against the odds, so here weare again...you saving me and me 
sending the gift of Faith and Hope to you my dear dear Gentleman...I wish you 
Longevity and Happiness in all you do, and although we shall most probably 
never meet...both you and your wonderful Daughter Hana Yasmeen feel very much 
like wonderful old fiends...God Bless always in gratitude Your Friend Geoff <br>

&nbsp; My Ali story is about the time that I got to 
meet The Champ on the day that he received his first honorary college degree, 
Doctor of Laws, at Mount Ida College in Newton Center, Massachusetts on May 28, 
1994. Growing up in the 1960s and 70s, I'd been following Ali's career since I 
was a kid, and always had a great admiration for not only his accomplishments 
in the ring, but also his humanitarian and ambassador work outside the ring. My 
grandmother, Miriam Robinson, was on the Board of Overseers at the school at 
that time, after many years there as an English professor. She'd received her 
annual invitation to the graduation ceremony, as well as an invitation to the 
post-commencement private reception for the six honorary degree recipients. I 
had no idea of what she was up to on the day when she initially invited me to 
be her escort for the day, but upon reading on the invitation that Muhammad Ali 
would be one of the honorees, I immediately said &quot;YES!&quot; At that very 
moment, I knew exactly what I would do with that once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity. At the commencement, we were seated near the stage, just to the 
right of Ali. During his acceptance speech, he said, to tumultuous applause: 
&quot;They called me The King; they called me The Greatest; they called me The 
Champion. Now they can call me 'The Doctor'.&quot; After the commencement, 
there was a short break while everyone filed out of the huge tent. I quickly 
went back to our car parked right outside to get a paper bag I'd stashed under 
the front seat (unbeknownst to my grandmother) and met her at the door of the 
Learning Resource Center, where the private reception was being held. The 
honorees were already inside, with a swarm of people around Ali, as you'd 
expect. He appeared to have a handful of small brochures that he was handing 
out. I immediately felt a 'buzz' as I entered the room and made my way in his 
direction. My grandmother went to sit with old friends nearby. Just then, we 
heard an announcement that Ali would not be signing autographs, but instead 
would be handing out brochures which he'd previously signed, entitled 
&quot;Women in Islam&quot;. Well, despite the fact that my plan would violate 
that edict, I reached inside the bag and pulled out a Magic Marker and a cloth 
boxing glove that was my grandfather's from the 1930s and took another step 
closer. When my turn came, I shook the Champ's hand and said: &quot;I know I'm 
not supposed to ask for this, but this glove was my grandfather's from the 30s 
and I hoped you'd make an exception&quot;. With my feet coming off the ground, 
I have no recollection of what he said in return, but he took the glove and 
marker from me, signed it &quot;Muhammad Ali 5-28-94&quot; and handed both back 
to me as I looked into his eyes and shook his hand again, saying &quot;Thank 
you very much&quot;. I turned and made my way through the crowd to where my 
grandmother was sitting. She started to ask me how it went, but when she saw 
how much I was visibly shaking, she said: &quot;Honey you'd better sit 
down!&quot; Now, I've met quite a few famous people in my life, but I'd never 
had such a reaction from the feeling of being in the presence of 'true 
greatness&rsquo;, neither before nor since. After collecting the local 
newspaper accounts the following day, I created a very nice framed display of 
the glove, pen, invitations and articles, and it remains one of my most prized 
possessions to this day and a beautiful memento of one of the most incredible 
days of my life. Thanks again, &quot;Doctor&quot;! P.S. I'm know Howard Bingham 
was right there taking pictures, but I've never been able to contact him about 
whether or not he took any while my glove was being signed. I'm sure he must 
have. What I wouldn't give for an 8x10 of that moment! Thank you very much!

&nbsp; I can 
remember as a small boy my intense admiration for Muhammad, however at that 
time such admiration was based on his exploits as an athlete. Having witnessed 
his metamorphosis during his steadfast stance against social inequality, civil 
rights issues and war, at all costs, even to the point of professing to 
Congress to have &quot;come here today ready to die!&quot;, since that time I 
too have grown, grown to admire this MAN to a point of elevating him to 
&quot;worshiped&quot; status! My God, Jesus Christ, my earthly Father and 
Muhammad Ali in that order! One of my ambitions in life is to but touch him, to 
be in his awesome presence and aura. I sincerely hope that before one of us 
leaves this life that goal will be met. I love that MAN !!! <br>

to get cured of their ailment. First is Muhammad Ali of his parkinson's disease 
and my brother Charles Olajide Idowu Silva who died of colon cancer in Nigeria 
on 9th April, 2010. I know so many people will achive greater height from the 
contribution of these noble men. My brother Ali, I hope to meet you in person 
one day. May Allah continue to use you for His Glory.Amin. <br>

After waiting a lifetime, finally meeting Muhammad Ali Author: BILL MILLER 
Edition: Final Section: J Crossroads Page: 03 Estimated printed pages: 5 
Article Text: After waiting a lifetime, finally meeting Muhammad Ali I had the 
third-best day of my life on the first of December this year. It comes in only 
behind my wedding day 18 years ago and the birth days of my three children. 
Why? Because on that day, I met Muhammad Ali. Meeting Ali has been a lifetime 
quest for me and that day was nothing short of remarkable. Many people take 
stands in their life but seldom have to give up everything because of those 
principles, especially if it involves forfeiting the greatest title in the 
world, world heavyweight champion. But Ali risked everything because of his 
belief that the war in Vietnam was wrong and he was willing to stake that 
belief against fame and money. During his exile from sports, he continued to 
work with the poor and less privileged, even though his future was in serious 
jeopardy. His faith and his principles were truly inspiring, especially for 
those of us who needed something or someone to believe in. As a boy of 12, I 
discovered boxing at a local boxing club. I stayed in the sport for three years 
until a family move forced me to quit. But while boxing, I discovered the story 
of Muhammad Ali. Like most young men, what initially impressed me was his great 
fighting ability and the heart he displayed in the ring. But as time passed, 
what impressed me the most was his love for people and his strong beliefs in 
right vs. wrong. His confidence in himself and his faith would not let anyone 
or anything stop him from fulfilling his destiny. At that time in my life, I 
desperately needed some inspiration and something or someone to believe in. For 
me, that was always Ali. I was abused by my stepfather to the point that I was 
too badly bruised to attend school. I was repeatedly told that I would never 
amount to anything. In my mind, I would imagine that I was just like Ali. No 
one could stop me from fulfilling my dreams if I believed in myself and always 
did what was right. That inspiration gave me the strength to put myself through 
college, working two and sometimes three jobs. I graduated with a 4.0 grade 
point average. Although I had no family to attend my graduation ceremony I can 
honestly say I was the proudest graduate on stage that night. Today, I am 46 
years old and living a life I could only have dreamed of 25 years ago. But with 
all my good fortune, I have never forgotten my roots and how I got to this 
point in my life. And that&rsquo;s why I wanted to meet Muhammad Ali, so I 
could thank him personally. So on Dec. 1, my wife Laurie and I arrived at the 
HueMan Bookstore in New York&rsquo;s Harlem. While we were waiting outside the 
bookstore for Ali&rsquo;s arrival, we noticed a small church in a run-down 
building across the street. Before we knew it, about 40 kids ran across the 
street into the bookstore. It became clear that Ali, true to his reputation, 
would visit with these kids before anyone else. Once the kids were inside, a 
GMC Yukon pulled up and people started to surround it. Inside was the 
&quot;greatest of all time.&quot; He was slighter in build than I expected, but 
he was very youthful looking for a man of 62. He arrived with no limo, no fancy 
entourage. The most famous person in the world had driven up to the bookstore 
in a truck no different from mine. As famous as he is, he is still a man of the 
people. We remained in line for approximately 45 minutes, and as the line 
slowly moved, my anxiety grew. I wondered what I would say to Ali after all of 
these years of wanting so desperately to meet my childhood hero. It was finally 
my turn, and I was both afraid and in awe. So my wife began explaining to 
Ali&rsquo;s assistant Kim that I had written to him three years ago, and that 
he had called me in response to my letter. I was not home at the time and how 
it had bothered me ever since. Almost instantly, Ali stood up and gave Laurie a 
huge heartfelt hug. He then stepped over and gave me a big hug as well. To say 
it touched me would not give the moment justice. Ali could see how nervous I 
was. He seemed to understand what it meant to me to meet him. So he began play 
box to ease my nervousness and then hugged me again and smiled. Not a word 
said, but not a word needed. For the next three hours, I watched Ali meet and 
greet his fans. He took special time with the elderly and especially young 
children. A little boy handed him a book that he had done in crayon entitled 
&quot;The Greatest,&quot; and you could see by the glint in his eye that Ali 
was touched by the boy&rsquo;s effort. He held and kissed every baby and child 
with no regard for age or race. All through the afternoon, Ali would pause and 
give that famous fighting glare and shake his fist at different people. I stood 
quietly and took it all in. Laurie kept saying that Ali kept looking back at me 
and glaring. He would jokingly shake his fist at me as I stood watching. 
Whatever the reason, he made me and many others feel special. That is the Ali 
magic. I heard someone say once that Ali was a credit to his race. I would 
agree &mdash; the human race. After the crowd subsided, I walked up to Ali and 
explained to him, the best way I could, what he meant to me. But mostly, I 
wanted to tell him: &quot;Thank you.&quot; Ali nodded, gave me another hug and 
smiled. His wife then showed up and tried to persuade him that it was time to 
go. It took a few minutes of urging. It was clear that Ali wanted to spend more 
time with the people who had had come to see him. It was truly amazing to see 
the love he showed everyone there. Afterward, I realized that when you look 
into Ali&rsquo;s eyes, you are looking into his soul. And in my opinion, there 
is no other soul more special than Ali. There is a gentleness and kindness to 
him that is unmistakable. In a complicated world, love is still the only thing 
anybody really needs. And Muhammad Ali seems to know that better than anyone.

&nbsp; I am currently working 
on a paper for one of my classes, but I am procrastinating and watching videos 
of Muhammad Ali's poems, fights and interviews. I don't think I can say that I 
am his number fan, but I can say that he is my biggest hero. He has inspired me 
to be a better Muslim and to dedicate my life to helping others. I am going to 
change the world through service and dedicate my life to serving others...but 
my one hope today is to meet Muhammad Ali. It would be a memory of a life time 
to get a chance to meet with him, just once. <br>

&nbsp; Ali consolidated his admiration by Africans in 1975 when he defeated 
george Foreman. I was a student at the University of lagos and the night was 
electrifying and we were convinced Ali has fulfilled a heroic mission in a 
continent where he is admired so much. I grew up following how Ali turned 
Sports into victory for the black race as they struggle for emancipation. I am 
also grateful to Ali whose legacy for pragmatism, lack of fear and grace has 
affected the perception of blak people world wide. Ali proved that one 
individual can change destiny of millions and his humantarian efforsts are 
recognized as part of his desire to share His blessings and goodwill to all. 
may Allah bless him wtith long life. May Allah heal him. Ali, we love you we 
adore you. Africa is your home and Africans adore you. <br>

&nbsp; Friends, do not interrupt the course of this letter, please 
send it to my brother Muhammad Ali and let him do as he must do. For the sake 
of the Allah (ST) Mercy and Merciful - help me to the coach - disabled!!! 
Appeal to my brother Muhammad Ali Bismillahirrahmanirrahim!!! Assalamu alaykum 
warahmatullahi wabarakatuh!!! Dear brother Muhammad Ali, if you can - help me 
for the sake of Allah (ST). I am looking for sponsors around the world for 
themselves and their activities. To you drawn coach - disabled from Chechnya, 
which the disease resides in France (year-round needs a warm maritime climate). 
I am over 30 years of disability (disabled person Soviet army since 1977. In 
1985 - 86 years had two operations to survive: deleted part of the left lung, 
three edges and two thirds of the stomach. So far, after minor physical and 
nervous disorders susceptible to pulmonary hemoptysis), But despite his 
disability, I as a Muslim - for the sake of Allah (ST) - more than 30 years of 
free education of children and young people (regardless of nation or religion), 
karate, and thus to accustom them to a healthy lifestyle and spiritual - moral 
purity. Dear brother, I appeal to the many years of Muslim rulers: Saudi 
Arabia, Brunei, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, 
Malaysia, but my letters to them, do not get - they just throw in their 
environment in the dustbin - although I'll forgive them for the sake of Allah 
(ST) to transfer my appeal recipients. I appeal to the press, too, but there 
are also indifferently silent. Mike, my brother, I lost everything in this life 
because of two wars in Chechnya: the mother and many relatives and friends whom 
I could not even last farewell. I and my family not nor home nor health, nor 
the possibility of a normal life, and for my eldest son became disabled after a 
head injury in 2009 that his back at work cowardly attacked the French brass 
knuckles addicts who have failed deal with him face to face and he lay 15 days 
in a coma, but the will of Allah (ST) survived, but not fully recovered. Him 
gave a disability but did not give pension( we immigrants and us can do 
anything ) and we submitted to the tribunal, but the result is still unknown, 
and when it is also unknown, because we have a social advocate, and to hire a 
lawyer in our normal no money. I came to France with his family to survive the 
most (frequent pulmonary hemoptysis threatened my life) and that children could 
have a future, and we are here to defeat the contrary. My son wanted to become 
a professional fighter karate, but it did and now disabled until we do not care 
about anyone. All my attempts to find the world of noble people, who would help 
me and my family no one was found, not even a single Muslim has responded and 
now brother You're my last hope and I know brother, that you help me, for you 
and you can not otherwise - because you're Muhammad Ali and it says it all. 
Brother, I'm not asking you for money (although it is very difficult and they 
need), I ask brother introduce me to a journalist who denounced my would appeal 
to the rulers of the Muslims that I have listed above, so that they would help 
me in my request, and a Dream , where I live for more than 33 years (dream of 
all my life - to collect means and to construct sports complex and on its base 
to open international training - sports, rehabilitation - healthy Center 
&quot;Peace and Mercy to children&quot;, where there could study free of charge 
and restore lost health and broken psychic condition - children, orphans, 
invalids, kids-victims of wars, ethnic conflicts and natural cataclysms) and 
the same free of charge raised and trained karate for children and young 
people, and most recently tried his hand at boxing and coaching in the home of 
his neighbor boy boxer Suliman Abdurashidova took him 3 months to win the 
French Cup in 2011, as well as in the semifinal of France - 2011, where he is 
in equal fight on points lost in the final and joined the French team where the 
training camp he was seriously injured the right shoulder and the doctors said 
that I needed surgery, but despite this he had his first fight for the national 
team and with one hand have won this battle, and then consented to surgery. 
This fight reminded me of 1975 when I served in the army (he played football) 
and it was somewhere in September brother you just fight with Joe Frazier. And 
when the fighting was, many set against you since you were a Muslim, and we all 
Chechens (12) were rooting for you and at this point the dispute who will win 
and who I stood up and said that Muhammad Ali would win and then a My 
colleague, an ethnic Russian (he was a boxer and champion of the Baltic 
Military District) stood up and said that he was a supporter of Joe Frazier, 
and that if you win, Joe Frazier, he will fight with me after hanging up. That 
is what happened to him and we fought without gloves. Boxer and street fighter 
- football and the fight was bloody and cruel, and no one wanted to give in, I 
broke my wrist, all my face was covered in blood, but I did not feel pain, but 
was just some sort of drowsiness, nausea, and heaviness in the head, but In 
spite of this I continued to fight one with his left hand and yet I the will of 
Allah (ST) sent him a knockout, and when he came to himself, I told him about 
the words that Muhammad Ali is my brother and I will tear him any. On the 
second day of my entire face was bruised (as in my opponent ), body ached, and 
we with him Tuscany dismantling the magistrate, but I was happy because I knew 
that I had won the hardest fight of his life, because Iovercame in himself 
defended his weaknesses and your name in part from ridicule, because if I would 
have lost this fight, I and my brothers Chechens - the Muslims would lose face 
and I swear by Allah (ST), it is true. Then I left to serve in Mongolia, and 
there began for himself karate, playing football in the same way, then began to 
rebel and then me and secretly and infected with pulmonary tuberculosis and 
after that I became disabled. After serving two years, I came home, opened the 
first section of karate in Chechnya, and since then, and began to teach their 
students free karate and to the extent possible to help children - the disabled 
and since I was born and in my cherished dream. I then fought many times in my 
life defending justice, walking on knives, going against the crowd, against the 
authorities (1983 anti-Soviet hunger strike 35 days) has passed two of the war, 
went to the bullets and bombs, and choked with his own blood, but never ever 
Allah (ST ) did not give me a reason to show their weakness and cowardice to 
show and when I did is bad, I think this fight and as I was then and this is 
difficult memory takes me back to life. I'm not a little-known pupils, but 
after the anti-Soviet hunger strike in 1983, they most cowardly betrayed me, 
but despite this I have the will of Allah (ST) suffered two serious operations, 
survived and still continue my labor of love of life - though have a very 
difficult one, because it is difficult to survive was his mother's death in 
2005, and I could not take her final journey, and now this injury her son in 
2009, which led to his disability, and crippled me and my wife completely, but 
try to stay as I can and all still hoping to put his main dream in life - a 
life and I hope very much that it's you and help my brother - Insha Allah. I'm 
somewhere in 2003 I think from Baku turned to you, but to me then someone from 
your entourage said that you have difficulties with money, because you build a 
sports complex and since I am looking for sponsors for their dreams, but I no 
one helped me and always a refusal, even when it was about saving the lives of 
children - disabled. I spoke to more than 1,000 firms and companies in the 
world to help me, but I refused to Wisdom, which is what is still important and 
could not believe it when I write, that if they refuse me, Allah (ST) - God 
will punish them because you can not deny coach - disabled in a world that so 
many years risking his life and brings free karate teaches children and young 
people and wherever possible helps seriously ill children in preparations for 
the treatment of the world and always at least the possibility of sharing with 
them their pensions . Brother, I hope that this time, my appeal will give your 
hands and you do so, as in this case should go my brother in the faith of 
Muhammad Ali which I fought and won in his youth as he and Insha Allah. Dear 
brother, me 56 years old and I do not know how much I have left and I would not 
want to leave because of life - an obscure and forgotten by giving children and 
young people 33 years of his life, health and welfare and that after my death 
my wife and 2 sons eked out a miserable life abroad. Brother help me!!! With 
hope and respect for coach - disabled, volunteer Ruslan Idrisov - official

&nbsp; On Easter Sunday, 1976 my family and I 
were headed to 6Flags in Virginia and as always, I had my camera with me. I was 
16 yrs old. As we drove through our neighborhood that early morning, which 
bordered the Sheraton Hotel in Landover Maryland, I noticed a group of very 
large men and In the ceter of the group was Muhammand Ali. I yelled for my 
father to stop the car its ALI and before the car could stop, my brothers and I 
had the doors open and were running towards Ali. His bodyguard seemed alarmed 
at this young white girl and her three brothers and as he grabbed my arm and my 
camera, Ali looked at him and said &quot;Take your hands off of that 
child.&quot; He was ultra cool, dressed in all black and was very calm and 
patient as he asked his bodyguard to take a family picture, with him in the 
middle! The picture taken many years ago brings back very fond memories, a few 
family members are now gone, but the fun and excitement of that day lives on. 
The picture is on display in my home, over 35 years later! Thanks for all you 
do Ali, you are still the greatest!!!! Love always!!!!!!!!! P.S. My Mom never 
let us watch violent movies, but my family never missed an Ali boxing match!

&nbsp; Muhammad Ali had such a huge impact on me 
as a young man growing up during the turmoil of the 60's and 70's. I grew to 
admire his courage and was truly inspired by his conviction to his ideals. And 
as a great fan of his bought a ticket with my college roommate to his comeback 
championship fight with the late great Joe Frazier in March of 1971. We 
hitchhiked from Ill to New York City for the fight - quite an adventure as we 
were thrown off the tollways twice by state troopers and gained the largest 
segment of our trip from an AWOL soldier in a stolen vehicle. Anyway I guess 
you can see how much Ali meant to us and how to this day I continue to admire 
this true treasure and unique American hero. <br>

&nbsp; I have started boxing inspired by Muhammad Ali boxing style and have 
honed my skills and movements trying to do what hevused to inthe ring. His life 
has helped me believe firmly that one shall never give up and keep fighting, I 
have recently named my little son Muhammad Ali Aniba and I am just so proud of 
that. one of my wish before I leave this planet would be to meet with a man who 
I looked upon to fight my fears and to become a strong and fearless fighter 
with an unbreakable spirit. I wish dearly to have this opportunity one day. God 
bless you all <br>
