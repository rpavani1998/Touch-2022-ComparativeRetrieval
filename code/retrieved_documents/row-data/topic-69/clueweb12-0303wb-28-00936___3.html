<h2>Being No. 1. By Colin Croft</h2> 
<p> My daughter Shannon, 22 on Monday 29th August, never lets me forget this: 
&quot;Father,&quot; she says authoritatively, &quot;whatever happens to you, I 
am always your only girl, No. 1!&quot; (There's a saying: &lsquo;fruits do not 
fall far from the tree...')</p> 
<p> Shannon is correct: in whatever sphere of life, might it be sport or 
industry, there really is only one No. 1.</p> 
<p> Being No. 1 in anything is not that difficult &mdash; not when compared to 
remaining there, even for a short time. &nbsp;Former West Indies captains Clive 
Lloyd and Brian Lara said it many times in their careers: &quot;Climbing that 
hill to be No. 1 is the easy part. Remaining as No. 1 takes so much more 
effort.&quot; Yup!</p> 
<p> Worryingly though, ICC's &quot;All-Time Team&quot; did not even include 
(Sir) Garfield Sobers, thought to be, at least, the best all-rounder ever, not 
to mention that many think that he is the best batsman too &mdash; No. 1.</p> 
<p> That Darren Sammy has been continued as West Indies captain is good, 
sensible news. No, he is not the best bowler in West Indies, nor is he the best 
batsman either. Indeed, he is not close to being the best all-rounder in the 
Caribbean, but he deserves to have that moniker as he is team captain: El 
Numero Uno!</p> 
<p> With that effort against India earlier this year, one that had only one 
negative spot &mdash; West Indies did not, as should have happened, beat India 
&mdash; Sammy was the obvious ongoing choice. It is an interesting exercise to 
understand and appreciate that there are not many contenders for that position 
anyway.</p> 
<p> When boxing was really boxing, there was only one No. 1 &mdash; champion 
&mdash; in each weight group too. That is why I had loved that sport so much 
then. No-one else makes a boxer No. 1. Only he does. He is the one who has to 
go out and, for 15 rounds in the olden days, or 12 nowadays, decimate all 
opponents.</p> 
<p> These days, boxing is so watered down that no-one even knows who is 
fighting whom anymore. I clearly remember boxing titans clashing; Muhammad Ali 
v Joe Frazier - thrice - and especially the first Roberto Duran v Sugar Ray 
Leonard fight. Every boxer had one objective: to be No. 1.</p> 
<p> So, picture it &mdash; West Indies tour of England, 1980. Everyone in the 
team is overly mesmerized by the slick, stealthy and sweet Sugar Ray Leonard, 
thought to be the reincarnation of the original Sugar Ray Robinson &mdash; 
except me. With the history that I had on Roberto, I knew that he would win 
that first fight!</p> 
<p> &lsquo;Manos de Piedra'&nbsp; Hands of Stone &mdash; Duran was the 
forerunner of &lsquo;Iron' Mike Tyson. Neither showed great finesse. They were 
both big, strong, determined, with one purpose, as Larry Holmes once said: 
&quot;To kill or to be killed. You must be prepared to die, to win, and become 
No. 1&quot;. Or as Ali suggested too: &quot;Round 13, Round 14, Round 15, 
championship rounds, rounds to be No. 1!&quot; Those were the days.</p> 
<p> Leonard was tough. In his career, Leonard did eventually beat Duran 
(&quot;No mas!&quot; etc.), Thomas Hearns, Wilfredo Benitez and 
&lsquo;Marvelous' Marvin Hagler &mdash; as good as any boxer could be, genuine 
No. 1. Leonard was also No. 1 pugilist to make more than US$100,000,000, (one 
hundred million US dollars) in boxing.</p> 
<p> Anyway, 11:00pm in Montreal that balmy June night was 3:00am in London. We 
were all up, looking and listening. This was Montreal, where Sugar Ray had won 
gold at the 1976 Olympics, at light-welterweight. Nearly 50,000 had gathered 
for &lsquo;Mano y Mano', Leonard v Duran I, one of the best boxing matches ever.
</p> 
<p> Montreal is also where Haseley Crawford, still Trinidad &amp; Tobago's No. 
1 (and still only) Olympic Gold medal winner beat Jamaica's Don Quarrie, 
Russia's Valeriy Borzov, USA's Harvey Glance and Johnny Jones, Panama's Guy 
Abrahams, East Germany's Klaus-Dieter Kurrat and Bulgaria's Petar Petrove. 
Crawford's effort, never repeated since, goes to show how hard it can be to be 
No. 1. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> On that night, June 20th 1980, I knew who would be No. 1. I even had a 
wager, for a Chinese dinner &mdash; that was all that we could afford back then 
&mdash; with the world's No. 1 batsman then, and for some, even now, (Sir) 
Vivian Richards, our own &lsquo;Smoking Joe.' He was quite magnanimous after 
defeat, probably his only defeat.</p> 
<p> Leonard lost because Duran brawled better, having been brought up in the 
barrios, enduring and beating twice opponents like another legend, Estanban de 
Jesus. As the saying goes; &quot;Roberto wanted it more!&quot; &lsquo;Hands of 
stone' forced &lsquo;the Sugar-man' to fight Duran's fight, a grave mistake for 
any No. 1.</p> 
<p> India also made mistakes in losing its No. 1 Test spot to England. India 
took its situation for granted, thus finding that being No. 1 is not easy. As 
former Australian captain, Ian Chappell (who knows what it is to be No. 1, 
kayoing England, 1974/5, and West Indies, 1975/6) said; &quot;India thought 
that they could simply turn up, play, and just win.&quot; Another No. 1, Curtly 
Ambrose, would say: &quot;Nuttin' wuk suh, Jack...&quot;</p> 
<p> I cannot remember England recently being thought of as No. 1 in Test 
cricket, though its progress is measured by Ashes series. In 1963, when West 
Indies beat England 3-1 in that year's Test series, West Indies were thought to 
have been No. 1, even though they had lost to Australia two years earlier.</p> 
<p> Now, there is no doubt about it. Andy Flower, Andy Strauss and the English 
boys have shown that with planning, hard work, dedication and considerable 
skills too, they can justifiably be called No. 1 in Test cricket. Since England 
also won the last ICC T-20 competition, they are two for two at being No. 1!</p>
<p> The trouble is to hold on to those crowns. West Indies lost only one Test 
series &mdash; a contentious 1-0 defeat, New Zealand 1979-80 &mdash; from 1976 
to 1995. That was a tremendously long time to be Test &lsquo;champeen'. 
Australia took hold from 1995 until 2009-10, similar kudos to West Indies reign 
as No. 1.</p> 
<p> India, with its internal cricket industry and politics, found out the hard 
way that is not an easy game in which to be No. 1. They looked unprepared, a 
poor effort for any defending champion. I fail to understand how such a huge 
population cannot find ample replacements. There ought to be sanctions for 
looking so bad!</p> 
<p> England are sitting pretty now. You can also rest assured that they will 
not be sitting back on their laurels, just waiting for something to happen. 
They will go out and make things happen to keep being No. 1.</p> 
<p> Next month, West Indies starts its Asian winter in Europe, with two T-20s 
v World Champions England at the Kennington Oval in London. Then they go to 
Bangladesh for two Tests and three ODIs, then to India for two Tests and five 
ODIs. This is a good time for West Indies to start climbing back to &mdash; 
hopefully &mdash; No. 1. Enjoy!</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
