&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
<br>
 George Foreman&rsquo;s crushing right uppercut connected for the first time in 
Round 1 and, suddenly, the heavyweight champion of the world was on the canvas. 
At ringside, the shocking sight sent Howard Cosell into a frenzy.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;Down goes Frazah! Down goes Frazah! Down goes Frazah!&rdquo; Cosell 
screamed into his ABC television microphone.<br>
<br>
Across the ring, Foreman 
was thinking one thing: Please don&rsquo;t let Joe Frazier get up.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;I saw him get up and I said to myself &lsquo;Oh boy, he&rsquo;s going to 
get me now,&rsquo;&rdquo; Foreman recalled Tuesday during a telephone 
interview. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want him getting up, and you really 
didn&rsquo;t want him getting up mad.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Get up Frazier did, only 
to go down again and again. Six times in all before the bell could sound to end 
the second round.<br>
<br>
Yet there he was still, out on his feet but still 
upright and ready for more. Frazier wasn&rsquo;t going to surrender his 
heavyweight title until the referee mercifully put an end to the carnage in 
Jamaica.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Joe Frazier wouldn&rsquo;t back away from King 
Kong,&rdquo; Foreman said. &ldquo;Joe Frazier was one brave man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Brave enough to take on the fearsome and much bigger Foreman in a fight he 
seemed destined to lose. Brave enough to hand Muhammad Ali his first loss and 
then almost fight to the death with him in the Philippines.<br>
<br>
But 
that&rsquo;s what Frazier was. An undersized warrior who didn&rsquo;t know how 
to back down. A fighter to the core.<br>
<br>
Understand that, and you 
understood Joe Frazier.<br>
<br>
He kept getting up when Foreman knocked him 
down. He kept trying to fight Ali even though one eye was swollen shut and he 
couldn&rsquo;t see out of the other.<br>
<br>
And he kept fighting for his 
rightful place in history until his death Monday night in Philadelphia at the 
age of 67.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;His pride and dignity made him fight to the 
end,&rdquo; Don King said. &ldquo;Joe never forgave Muhammad Ali for what he 
did to him, but Joe Frazier proved that he wasn&rsquo;t only a great fighter 
but a great man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I spent some time talking to Frazier earlier 
this year as he reminisced about his career and his life. The 40th anniversary 
of the Fight of the Century was looming, and Frazier was more than happy to 
talk about a memorable night long past.<br>
<br>
No one in Madison Square 
Garden that night, it seemed, wanted him to beat Muhammad Ali. Not the fans who 
scraped together enough money to get a cheap seat in the rafters, and certainly 
not the celebrities and various rogues of the night who dressed in their finest 
to parade around ringside before the bout.<br>
<br>
Frank Sinatra shot pictures 
for Life magazine from ringside. Barbra Streisand and Bill Cosby watched from 
seats just a few steps away.<br>
<br>
They saw Frazier do what no man had done 
before &mdash; beat the great Ali. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, he knocked Ali 
down in the 15th round with one of his classic left hooks to seal the deal.<br>

<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go nowhere where it&rsquo;s not mentioned,&rdquo; 
Frazier said. &ldquo;That was the greatest thing that ever happened in my 
life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He fought Ali the way he fought everyone, with his chin 
planted on his opponent&rsquo;s shoulder, because that was the only way he 
could fight. Frazier barely stood 5-foot-10, never weighed more than 205 or so. 
He wasn&rsquo;t going to beat people with his physical skills, so he figured 
out a way to keep relentless pressure on until he could find a way to land a 
left hook that surely was one of the most beautiful punches in boxing.<br>
<br>

It didn&rsquo;t work against Foreman because Foreman was simply too big, too 
powerful. Ali found a way to beat him in their final two fights, too, including 
a fight so epic that boxing people simply shake their heads when asked what 
happened at the Thrilla in Manila.<br>
<br>
Ali would later say it was the 
closest thing he ever knew to death. Though blinded by his swollen eyes, 
Frazier still tried to fight the 15th round against one of the greatest 
fighters ever.<br>
<br>
The bitterness toward Ali that Frazier carried 
throughout the rest of his life was especially rooted in that fight. Ali called 
him a gorilla, an Uncle Tom. When Frazier returned home, his children asked why 
the other kids at school were saying the same thing.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Joe could 
never forgive him for that,&rdquo; King said over the phone. &ldquo;But you 
have to know the times, the race struggle in America. Joe couldn&rsquo;t 
understand why some of the blacks looked at him with disdain and then extolled 
Muhammad Ali. But Smokin&rsquo; Joe was an integral part of history. That fight 
changed things for a lot of people. It changed the respect paid when people 
would look at other people of color.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
That fight changed things 
for Frazier, too. Neither he nor Ali were ever the same after the brutal bout, 
and Frazier would have only one more meaningful fight, a second knockout loss 
to Foreman.<br>
<br>
He would burn through all the riches he made in the ring, 
ending up in an apartment over his gym in Philadelphia. But he loved to make 
appearances, loved to be with fans, as he was in September when he signed 
memorabilia in Las Vegas.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Joe Frazier, sharp as a razor,&rdquo; 
he told them.<br>
<br>
Ali put out a statement saying he would always remember 
Frazier with respect and admiration, something Frazier surely would have 
scoffed at.<br>
<br>
In the end, he&rsquo;ll go down as one of the great 
heavyweights ever, a man who fought hard in Ali&rsquo;s shadow, then fought 
even harder to get out of it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;All he wanted to do was beat up 
Muhammad Ali one more time,&rdquo; Foreman said. &ldquo;Maybe someday in heaven 
he&rsquo;ll have a chance to do it.&rdquo;<br>
