<b>DESCRIPTION</b>  With 
an all new physics based fighting engine, new physics driven animations, truly 
unique and differentiated boxer styles, and the most impressive boxer roster 
ever including the return of the legendary Iron Mike Tyson, &quot;Fight Night 
Round 4&quot; takes video game boxing and fighting to an entirely new level.<br>
<br>New Physics Engine <br>
Featuring a dramatically improved physics engine, 
Fight Night Round 4 brings players closer to the sweet science than ever 
before. Through these upgrades fighters are rendered more vividly than ever and 
action is animated as it happens, meaning that not only are no two rounds the 
same, but no two punches are the same either. This variety in punches is most 
evident at the point of impact, where players will see everything from the 
sweat splatter of devastating shots, to the energy-sucking effects of solid 
body blows and the virtual lack of impact glancing blows may have on a 
determined opponent. But when enough of any punches land the damage system 
built into the new physics system will allow players to clearly see the impact 
on opponents exactly when and where you hit them. A bloody nose or lip, a cut 
or swelling over the eye, a bruised forehead or shoulder; players will see them 
all, and it's their choice whether to take advantage and go for the stoppage.
<br> <br>
In addition, the improved physics also makes for a significantly 
faster gameplay experience. Along with the game's controller and overall 
movement tweeks this allows player's to string together punches into 
devastating combinations. Although a single punch still has the potential to 
take down a rival, just as in real boxing match, combinations and the ability 
to avoid them are the key in Fight Night Round 4.<br>
<br>
Height, Reach and 
Styles Matter<br>
As in real boxing, where height and reach have advantages and 
disadvantages depending on your opponent and your skill, Fight Night Round 4 
forces players to use their fighters' physical characteristics and styles to 
their advantage, or suffer the consequences. these consequences come by way of 
fighters ability to now fight effectively in close, as well as from a distance. 
For example, shorter fighters are often faster than taller opponents and tend 
to do better on the inside against taller fighters, but they must get inside 
first. If they choose to fight at a distance, the advantage is lost. Similarly, 
height and the assumed longer reach that goes with it is a sizable advantage, 
but only if a fighter &quot;fights tall,&quot; that is stand up straight and 
utilizes the jab and other punches to maintain the optimal distance to from 
opponent that allows him to hit and not be hit in return. Slouch and/or abandon 
the jab, and the reach advantage is lost.<br>
<br>
New Heads Up Display Adds 
Blocking Ability<br>
In addition to the traditional Heads Up Display (HUD), 
which has always provided Fight Night players with a visual representation of 
the changing health and stamina or their fighters, Fight Night Round 4 adds 
blocking to its HUD. Designed to both provide an ongoing way to monitor your 
fighter's ability to defend himself when not punching and facilitate action 
during rounds by encouraging players to develop additional defensive and 
offensive skills, blocking is yet another realistic addition introduced by 
Fight Night Round 4. When players lose the ability to block punches they can 
not avoid punches thrown by opponents and must go on the offensive or take the 
punches. Blocking ability, as well as health and stamina can be replenished 
between rounds by assigning points accumulated for action in the ring to any of 
the three physical states/abilities.<br>
<br>
