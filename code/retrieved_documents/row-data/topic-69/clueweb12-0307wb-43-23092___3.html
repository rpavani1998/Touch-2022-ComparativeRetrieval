 Fighting games 
haven't really changed since they first appeared in arcades: hit buttons in 
different combinations and cause damage to the other player. 'Fight Night 2004' 
seeks to address this by introducing a concept called &quot;total punch 
control&quot;. This new concept is certainly inventive as well as being a lot 
of fun; but the rest of the game is a bit of a letdown.<br>
<br>
 The Total 
Punch Control innovation takes the buttons out of the equation and uses the 
second joystick to control your punches. Using the right joystick readies your 
boxer for a punch. Pushing forward and left or right jabs. Moving the joystick 
left or right, then pushing forward swings the boxers arm out for a hook. 
Moving the joystick toward back left or right, then pushing forward performs 
uppercuts. Squeezing the right trigger and moving the right joystick allows for 
blocks. Using the left trigger, you can also weave and bob out of the way of 
incoming punches. Holding the left trigger and punching with the right joystick 
performs a body punch. Finally, the black button performs the signature move, 
and white performs the illegal headbutt or groin jab. Whilst at first it feels 
a little awkward it's meant to simulate the actions of real boxers and after a 
while you find the action becomes quite natural; you can work up quite a rhythm 
punching and blocking. When all of these manoeuvres are used it amounts to 
quite an impressive, flowing battle, and for those totally uncoordinated 
there's the option to use the face buttons for punching.<br>
<br>
 The game is 
further enhanced by its realistic health system. Throw too many punches, and 
the power of the punches and stamina decrease. Getting hit in the head does 
more damage than being hit in the body, and a kidney punch does more damage 
than a blow to the arm, making it less of a button masher and more of a 
realistic representation of boxing. More realism comes in the form of cuts and 
bruises, flying blood, and rag doll physics (which kick in with the knockout 
punch). More often than not you can keep hitting your opponent as they slide to 
the floor, and it's especially brutal if you've got them in the corner or on 
the ropes.<br>
<br>
 There is a wealth of real life fighters from today and 
yesterday (including Roy Jones Jr., Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Joe 
Frazier and Muhammad Ali), but if your favourite boxer isn't featured, the 
create-a-boxer feature is more than good enough to get you the fighter you're 
after. However, the game is let down by a poor career mode, average graphics 
and a terrible soundtrack.<br>
<br>
 Single player Career mode is almost a 
joke. You earn money and unlock certain things, but they're all irrelevant: 
clothing, gloves and protective devices are mostly the same thing in different 
colours and the signature moves and taunts are used rarely (or not at all, if 
the face buttons are configured to punch). Most of the other unlockables are 
for the entrance animation, such as your entourage (well, chicks in bikinis), 
music and effects. After you've seen it for the first few times, you want to 
skip it and get into the fight. Also, there are only six arenas to unlock and 
you're forced to retire at the age of 40.<br>
<br>
 The graphics of the boxers 
and the arenas are quite good but these don't really tax the Xbox at all. The 
real time blood, cuts and bruises look great, but we've seen it before in 'Tao 
Feng.' The crowd, although rendered in 3D, has the same looped animations and 
they look to suffer from a bad frame rate, although the action in the ring 
itself remains steady. Another let down is the fighter models. Although they 
all look different, due to the robust fighter creation system, they're all 
essentially the same model with the same moves. Watch Ali or Frazier fight in 
real life and you can see they're totally different sorts of fighters who move 
and hold their weight differently. In the game, the only differences between 
fighters are the stance and the fact that some fighters move faster.<br>
<br>
 
Sound-wise the fighters are again quite well done, and the sound of the harder 
hits will make you wince. However the commentary gets repetitive quickly (but 
fades out as you or your opponent get closer to being knocked out, replaced by 
a thumping heartbeat that amps up the tension dramatically) but the 
&quot;street&quot; mentality of the game, reflected in the &quot;ghetto&quot; 
style music, really sucks. P-Diddy, Nelly, and a heap of wannabes do awful 
&quot;rap,&quot; making me think the custom soundtrack feature should be a 
mandatory feature in all future EA games. What's even worse is there are only 
about 10 tracks, so you'll hear them again and again and again...<br>
