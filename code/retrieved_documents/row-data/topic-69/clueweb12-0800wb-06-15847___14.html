<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> It would be easy to judge this as heresy, but when I suggest that recent 
meetings of Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech have been a bit like the Frazier-Ali 
trilogy of the early 1970s, it's meant to honor the utter investment both teams 
seem to make when taking on the other.</p> 
<p> No words can capture the complete essence of Frazier-Ali. </p> 
<p> In truth, there may never be anything athletic as wholly captivating as 
the three-pack of boxing matches between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali in the 
1970s. That may be the gold standard of athletic competition, of men summoning 
more than anyone might expect them to have.</p> 
<p> Ali won two of those fights, Frazier one. In the first and third, the 
world heavyweight title was on the line. The winner of the second would earn a 
shot at the belt.</p> 
<p> That's not unlike the Tech-Tech rivalry, especially since Paul Johnson 
became head coach of the Yellow Jackets before the 2008 season. The Hokies have 
won twice, the Jackets once. Each time, the winner went on to win the ACC's 
Coastal division, and then the conference title.</p> 
<p> &quot;Since I've been here, this game has been a big, big game every 
year,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;This game has been a big part of the division 
race. Again this year, if we lose we're out of the race, so to speak, so it's a 
big game for us.&quot;</p> 
<p> In '08, the Jackets were big underdogs in Blacksburg, Va., yet gave the 
Hokies hell for three hours as famed VT defensive coordinator Bud Foster went 
bananas trying to scheme against Johnson's fangled option offense.</p> 
<p> Georgia Tech outgained the defending ACC champions 387 yards to 247, and 
when Josh Nesbitt scored on an 18-yard run with 9:28 to tie the game (with the 
help of a two-point conversion), an upstart was banging its way into the 
conference consciousness.</p> 
<p> The Hokies held on, winning on a field goal with 4:37 left in the game, 
winning, really, only because Georgia Tech turned the ball over three times as 
the home team never coughed it up. The Jackets nonetheless made it clear that 
they were going to be a pain in the ACC's butt.</p> 
<p> A year later, VT was the No. 4 team in the land upon visiting The Flats, 
but in a rousing Saturday night game inBobby Dodd Stadium the Jackets - ranked 
No. 19 themselves - pulled out a 28-23 win that may not have been that close.
</p> 
<p> Foster looked as if he might expire. The Jackets completed just one pass, 
yet rushed for 309 yards. Nesbitt went for 122 and three touchdowns by himself.
</p> 
<p> Last season, when the Jackets probably had no business competing with the 
Hokies after Nesbitt broke his arm late in the first half in Blacksburg,Tevin 
Washington rallied the visitors to tie in another nationally-televised contest, 
this on a Thursday night.</p> 
<p> For the third year in a row, the Jackets ran Foster crazy, rushing for 346 
yards while out-gaining the Hokies 426-335. The Jackets, in fact, led 14-0 
after Nesbitt's 71-yard gallop - his second TD of the game.</p> 
<p> There were plenty of big plays in that one, including Roddy Jones' 5-yard 
run on a late fourth-and-4, and thenOrwin Smith's 9-yard run to tie it with 
2:34 left.</p> 
<p> No play was bigger, though, than David  Wilson's 90-yard kickoff return 
before Smith had even caught his breath. That moved the Hokies up 28-21.</p> 
<p> Even then, Georgia Tech wouldn't go away. Lane Stadium was rocking, yet 
Washington drove the Jackets to the Virginia Tech 17-yard-line before an 
interception in the end zone with eight seconds left sealed the deal.</p> 
<p> &quot;It's always a tough game when we play VT,&quot; said junior guard 
Omoregie Uzzi. &quot;This will be one of the biggest games of my life.&quot; 
</p> 
<p> So now Georgia Tech (7-2, 4-2 ACC) is ranked No. 20, and Virginia Tech 
(8-1, 4-1) is No. 10.</p> 
<p> This is not Frazier-Ali, but nobody should be surprised if the intensity 
of Thursday night's game rivals that of championship matches.</p> 
<p> Joe Frazier was one of my earliest favorite athletes. </p> 
<p> Honestly, I latched onto him both because at the time - when as a 7- and 
8-year-old I was beginning to pick favorites in everything - he was the world 
heavyweight champion (at about 205 pounds, which BTW is Washington's listed 
weight), and because he was not Ali.</p> 
<p> I didn't care for Ali, or any hyper-confident athletes. My best friend was 
a Jerry Quarry fan, but even then I could see that Quarry had no shot. My 
interest in Frazier, after all, prompted me to check out how-to-box books from 
the library. I quickly made myself an expert (hah).</p> 
<p> Joe was an underdog on multiple levels. He was smallish. His style was 
utterly inelegant. He was perceived by many to be an interloper in a kingdom of 
others in the waning years of an era when a handful in boxing's upper crust 
were considered athletic royalty. Joe ran a jackhammer among bluebloods.</p> 
<p> Upon learning that Frazier had beaten Ali in 1971, my week was made. I 
asked, and my father gave me the news at breakfast. Later, I saw a write-up in 
The Columbus Dispatch. Remember, TV replays were few and far between and other 
than sluggish newspaper and magazine accounts, word-of-mouth was king.</p> 
<p> Both men spent time in the hospital after that one. </p> 
<p> Consequently, I was crushed when Ali beat Frazier twice the next four-plus 
years (and mortified when George Foreman destroyed Joe in the interim).</p> 
<p> It was so annoying to read and even see on ABC's Wide World of Sports the 
way Ali toyed publicly with Frazier, and I loathed Howard Cosell's role in 
that; he gave Ali too big a platform. The man made a sword out of a microphone, 
and a sledge out of cameras.</p> 
<p> When given chances, Frazier wasn't nearly eloquent enough to blunt the 
blade nor slow the anvil. Frustration was evident on Joe's face, even to a kid. 
That made me mad.</p> 
<p> Today, one day after the passing of one of my very first heroes, I can't 
shake Frazier's Miller Lite beer commercial from my mind.</p> 
<p> Neither can I cut loose of the notion that without Frazier - who nearly 
beat Ali to a pulp in their third fight only to find himself beaten just as 
badly - was no less responsible for making Ali than Ali himself.</p> 
<p> I haven't looked it up to be certain of the exact phrasing, but Ali said 
something like, &quot;It was the closest thing to dying,&quot; after the 
&quot;Thrilla in Manilla.&quot;</p> 
<p> Replays were more readily available by 1975. It's hard nowadays to believe 
that boxing was once taken seriously, but upon watching that one again it's not 
so difficult any more. Those two men threw everything at each as if their lives 
were hanging in the balance. Unreal.</p> 
<p> It ended when Frazier's corner man, Eddie Futch, wouldn't let his boxer go 
out for the 15th and final round. Legend is fuzzy on some details, but it has 
been told that Ali had told corner man, Angelo Dundee, to cut his gloves off as 
well.</p> 
<p> &quot;Frazier quit just before I did,&quot; Ali said. &quot;I didn't think 
I could fight any more. Joe Frazier, I'll tell the world right now, brings out 
the best in me.&quot;</p> 
<p> Sorry for the loose parallels today. Smokin' Joe's on my brain. </p> 
<p> I'm betting the Jackets and Hokies are going to go at it Thursday. Frank 
Sinatra won't be ring-side snapping pictures, nor will anybody fail to answer a 
bell. Like a couple of bull-headed boxers, though, the Techs seem certain to 
elevate each through their exchange of competitive nature.</p> 
<p> &quot;When you run out and the stadium is packed and the crowd is into it, 
you can kind of feel the atmosphere and when things started going well and the 
fans got behind them, I think you feed off that,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's 
fun to be out there when that's going on.&quot;</p>
