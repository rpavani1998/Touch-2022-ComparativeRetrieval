<p><b>True boxing fans</b> should definitely stay away. I know the lineup in 
this games makes it extremely tempting, but the resulting game is a chore to 
play and will only disappoint.<b>Casual boxing fans</b> dying to take on the 
boxing world as your favorite boxer should rent this game first. If you're 
dying for a boxing fix, then own the PlayStation version. The PlayStation 
version includes 50 boxers compared to the N64's 25 and is a much truer 
simulation than the N64 version. There are also key bonuses only available on 
the PlayStation like boxer bios, a 'classic fights' option and even a music 
video. Some of you may dig the ring babes in thong bikinis.<b>Arcade boxing fans
</b> should get a Dreamcast (if you don't already have one) and get <i>Ready 2 
Rumble</i>.</p> <br>

<p>Some of the greatest events in sports history have been boxing matches. 
I've seen just about all of them on highlight films and they've always been 
touted as &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; and, to be honest, a few of 
them actually lived up to the hype. The ones that come to mind are the old 
school battles between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier; which were nothing short 
of epic. Ever since I first saw those fights, I've been dying to get into the 
ring and try my hands at recreating some of those matches in a video game. 
Unfortunately, videogame publishers have not been too cooperative. They have 
insisted on releasing games that were flashy and cartoony spin-offs of<i>
Punchout</i>, which hit the arcades in the 1980's. So you can understand my 
excitement when I first heard about<i>Knockout Kings</i> (<i>KK</i>). It was 
supposed to be the first true boxing simulation, allowing me to play as the 
best fighters to ever grace the boxing ring. Instead, it wound up being an 
updated version of<i>Buster Douglas</i> (remember him?) <i>Boxing</i>. EA 
Sports picked itself up off the mat and came back with a sequel (imaginatively 
enough) entitled<i>Knockout Kings 2000</i> (<i>KK2000</i>). Well I've played it 
and by the end of the review, you'll know whether EA Sports is a comeback kid 
or whether they should just throw in the towel.</p> 
<p>It's apparent right from the beginning that <i>KK2000</i> wants to be a 
sim. EA went out and secured the license for all the great boxers (sans Iron 
Mike) and put them in the game. They used a new face wrapping technology that 
allows for realistic-looking facial textures to be used for each boxer and 
Black Ops copied each boxer's signature moves for even more authenticity. Add a 
point system (to tally your performance during a bout) and a training mode, and 
you have the makings of a great boxing game. I'm sure that Black Ops thought 
this too when they finished their design document, but from the conception 
phase to the production phase, they seemed to have gotten off-track in a big 
way. As the game intro winds down we see in-game footage of Ali pulverizing an 
unidentified boxer. It's obviously supposed to showcase the game (and Ali), but 
with the slow overall look of the action and the horrible collision detection, 
it actually becomes an omen for what is to come.</p> 
<p>But originally, I paid that no mind and went on through to the boxer 
selection screen. To its credit, Black Ops has created some excellent-looking 
3D representations of boxing's greats but I wasted little time in choosing 
Muhammad Ali with Joe Frazier as my opponent and Caesar's Palace as the 
battleground. Anticipation was high and, I must admit, so were my expectations. 
And if all those press releases from EA were even half-true, then<i>KK2000</i> 
could pull it off. Once I got past the introductions and got the blessing of 
Mills Lane (who looks and sounds like the real thing), the fight began. I 
anxiously rushed Frazier and proceeded with a flurry of rights and lefts that 
were sure, I thought, to do damage and leave him stunned. But what actually 
happened was that after a vicious right hook, Frazier came back immediately 
with a right hook of his own. It went on like this for a few seconds before I 
realized that we were just trading punches. I didn't think much of it then so I 
just backed off and decided to try out the signature moves mapped onto the four 
C-buttons. I was pleasantly surprised to see Ali pull off his trademark 
showboating and punches, but what bothered me about those moves was how little 
they actually helped. They were oftentimes blocked or Frazier would simply move 
out of the way and I was left to wait for the motion-captured animation to end 
and get pummeled, because I was left totally open for an attack.</p> 
<p>When I finally was able to block, I absorbed Frazier's assault and 
proceeded to launch an assault of my own. I used every punch available and lit 
into Frazier with a vengeance. And again, the result was not what I expected 
because half my punches (as lethal as they were) completely missed their 
target, even at point blank range. When I tried it again, we wound up 
exchanging punches again to the point where I thought I watching a digital 
version of<i>Rock'em Sock'em Robots</i>. It was here that I was not paying 
attention and Frazier caught me with a vicious roundhouse punch (a punch that 
is performed by hitting the punch button while holding down the R button). It 
looked like something out of<i>Soul Calibur</i> (complete with a colored 
inertia trail) and had me scratching my head as to why it would be in a boxing 
sim. But I wanted to win this fight so I tried it myself and it landed with 
similar results; I tried it again and it landed again. Before I knew it, my 
punch meter was full and I knew that I could do some kind of &quot;super 
punch.&quot; I was dying to see some kind of vicious flurry of blows or 
something characteristic of Ali, instead what I saw was a ridiculous,<i>Mortal 
Kombat</i>-style uppercut. And while watching Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer 
in history, pulling off a move like this is one thing, seeing Frazier do a back 
flip after the punch is another and I decided I had enough. It was at this 
point that the bell rang and I was declared the winner. However, I had already 
given up on the match of the century and decided to go through the rest of the 
game.</p> 
<p>After choosing other boxers, I found nothing new that I didn't experience 
with my first fight. All the boxers, yes all 25 of them, fought with all the 
pepper of a loaf of bread and had almost identical animations. I could only 
tell them apart by their signature moves and that got old quickly. You can't 
imagine how disheartening it was to see Sugar Ray Leonard move and fight almost 
exactly like Eric &quot;Butterbean&quot; Esch.<i>KK2000</i> becomes an example 
of disregarding the player for the sake of landing a license; I would wager 
that the<i>KK</i> engine had long existed before the licenses were secured and 
was ported over from some generic boxing game. What managed to save the game 
though was its create-a-player feature and the career mode. While it may come 
off as below-average as compared to other gamers, it worked into the career 
mode wonderfully. I could create a boxer, train him, and build him up into a 
championship contender. That was probably the most fun I had playing this game, 
but it was short-lived because of all the flaws I mentioned above and the fact 
that all create-a-player features get old.</p> 
<p>My Ali-Frazier fight didn't turn out as I had hoped. I won the fight, but 
it was a hollow victory.<i>KK2000</i> lacked damn near every-thing I saw in 
those legendary fights with the exception of the fighters themselves. The feel 
of vicious punches was missing, the characters moved too slowly, and none of 
the fighters distinguished themselves. Whatever was in the game to add realism 
was negated by the over-the-top arcade elements. The only true representative 
from the boxing world was Mills Lane (how sad is that?).<i>KK2000</i> is an 
improvement over the original<i>KK</i>, which says more about the sheer 
mediocrity of<i>KK</i> than about any greatness of its sequel. <i>KK2000</i> 
could have been a very good game, but everything starting from the graphics 
engine to the game mechanics is so bungled that it leaves<i>KK2000</i> down for 
the count.</p> <i>- Published November 9, 1999 </i> <b>Amazon.com
