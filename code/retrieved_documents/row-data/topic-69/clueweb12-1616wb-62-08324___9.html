<h3> FSD History Flashback: October 1 </h3> 
<p> <br>
<br>
On October 1, 1975, one of the greatest rivalries in sports 
history came to a head. It was on this day in Manila, Phillippines that boxers 
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier took to the ring in a third, climaxing event in 
what many call the greatest fight of all-time. The &quot;Thrilla in 
Manila&quot; was on as Ali defended his WBA/WBC Heavyweight Titles.<br>
<br>
If 
there was ever two contrasts in styles among two opponents, this was it. Ali 
was the arrogant fighter who used quickness and speed. Frazier was a power 
puncher that was serious about his craft. Ali also insisted that Frazier was 
washed up before this fight after he lost to George Foreman as well as Ali in 
their second fight. This was a recipe that sparked what many say is the most 
heated rivalry in the history of sports.<br>
<br>
In the opening round of the 
fight, Ali wanted to take advantage of Frazier, who was known for starting out 
slow in fights. Ali used his quickness and nailed Frazier with a flurry of 
punches. Even though Frazier was hurt by this, he kept coming at Ali to where 
it frustrated him.<br>
<br>
By the middle rounds, Ali had appeared to be tired. 
Frazier was able to take advantage, and used power punches to the body of Ali. 
In the sixth round, Frazier stunned Ali with a left hook which nearly put him 
on the mat. When the seventh round came, it was reported that Ali whispered in 
Frazier's ear, &quot;They said you were washed up.&quot; Frazier said, 
&quot;They lied&quot;.<br>
<br>
The heat had begun to take it's toll on the 
fighters, but it appeared that Frazier would be able to win by the 10th round. 
In the 11th round, Ali made a startling comeback as he badly damaged the face 
of Frazier with a flurry of punches.<br>
<br>
Ali continued the momentum as 
Frazier had no answer for the right-hand punches to the face. At one point in 
the 13th round, Ali knocked Frazier's mouthpiece into the front row of fans. 
Ali continued the assault, and Frazier threw very few punches as Ali continued 
on.<br>
<br>
At the end of the 13th round, Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch wanted 
to stop the fight after the damage he took. Frazier refused to give up, and he 
came out for the 14th round.<br>
<br>
Ali had closed the right eye of Frazier, 
and he continued to pound away at him. Frazier, who was defenseless, took a 
major beating in which he almost went down to the canvas as the bell rang to 
end the round. Ali's energy was spent, but Futch finally decided to stop the 
fight after the 14th round. Ali won the fight, and immediately fainted in his 
corner. Ali later said that this was as close as he came to dying after the 
sweltering heat got to him.<br>
<br>
It was later revealed that Frazier had a 
cataract in his left eye which meant by the time Ali closed his right eye with 
punches, he was virtually fighting blind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Joe Frazier, I'll tell 
the world right now, brings out the best in me. I'm gonna tell ya, that's one 
helluva man, and God bless him,&quot; said Ali after the fight.<br>
<br>
The 
fight was a huge financial success with many countries being able to see it 
with an HBO antenna. Cairo, Egypt was considered a location for the fight 
according to an issue of<em>Ring Magazine</em>.<br>
<br>
Ali is widely 
considered by many to not only be the best boxer ever, but athlete, too. He 
lost the title to Leon Spinks in 1978, but regained it in the rematch which 
later led him to retirement. He came back for a rematch against Larry Holmes in 
a loss in 1980, and retired for good after a loss to Trevor Berbick in 1981. 
Ali finished his career 56-5-0 with 37 wins coming by knockout.<br>
<br>

Frazier went on to face Foreman, and lost which prompted his retirement. He 
later appeared in the 1976 box office hit<em>Rocky</em> which saw the title 
match take place in his town of Philadelphia. He finished with a record of 
32-4-1 with 27 wins by knockout. He lost to Ali and Foreman twice which were 
the only losses of his career.<br>
<br>
This fight was ranked No. 5 by ESPN's 
Sports Century panel of experts in the Greatest Games/Moments in the 20th 
Century.<br>

<p>Nice one. I was but a few days old when the Thrilla in Manilla went down. 
Boxing has truly lost its luster.</p> <br>

<p>Lester- I wasn't born until November 1974 myself, so we're the same age.<br>
<br>Boxing has seen too much negative publicity that it's going to take alot 
for it come back strong. Combine that with the competition of MMA and UFC, and 
it's really an uphill battle for the sport.</p> <br>

<br>Sorry to hear that about Marvis' wife.<br>
<br>
Great story about you and 
your hubby in Philly. By all means, show this to him Cindy. It would be awesome

this fight was up for auction? a boxer friend of ours had it up for charity.

<p>Cindy- Thanks for sending the link to him!<br>
<br>
Yes, I do remember that 
YB post about Frazier and his fight robe. I never saw the result of that, and 
had no idea that you tried to get it yourself.<br>
<br>
Well, the Thrilla in 
Manila was by far the best moment for October 1.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the 
support Cindy!:)</p> <br>

<p>though Ali won that night, I like to remember Joe winning the more 
important fight that American culture was riding on.<br>
<br>
I met Joe outside 
of his dojo in Broad St. and thanked him for about 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
What a 
nice man.<br>
<br>
BSF? That thing we just talked about? Nachos refers to it on 
his TSN thing...he may need your help?</p> <br>

<p>3rd- It's always good to meet someone as legendary as Joe Frazier, isn't it?
<br><br>
I'm going to see about contacting fanofreds about this. I thought I 
contacted him before, but maybe not. We'll see what we can do about that.</p>

<p>MadMan- Agreed about boxing never being the same. I wasn't around during 
much of that era, but from what I've read, it was the most competitive era in 
boxing history.<br>
<br>
Cindy- You really are providing good stuff about 
Frazier. Thanks.<br>
<br>
rideordie- Frazier is a legend for sure. It was a 
great rivalry because of how different they really were. I don't know if sports 
will ever find a more fitting and intense rivlary like they had. And to think, 
I wasn't even alive to witness this or their other fights! Thanks for stopping 
by.</p>
