<p>Chapter 16 Trials</p> 
<p>(1 Peter 1:6, 7) Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, 
if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,</p> 
<p>that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold that perisheth 
though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at 
the revelation of Jesus Christ:</p> 
<p>Peter is describing people who at one and the same time are greatly 
rejoicing and yet are in heaviness.</p> 
<p>Paradoxical, but it is not contradictory.</p> 
<p>There is that teaching concerning the Christian life which gives the 
impression that once one has arrived at a decision, or once one has been 
converted, there are no more troubles, no ripples on the sea of life. 
Everything is perfect and there are no problems whatsoever.</p> 
<p>Now the simple answer to that view is that it is not New Testament 
Christianity.</p> 
<p>Heaviness means to be grieved, it means we are troubled.</p> 
<p>(2 Cor 4:8-10) we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, 
yet not unto despair;</p> 
<p>pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;</p> 
<p>always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus..</p> 
<p>The Christian is not one who has become immune to what is happening round 
and about him.</p> 
<p>The word translated temptations really means &lsquo;trials&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Peter says that they were troubled because they were experiencing these 
manifold trials. They come in different was and colors, in different shapes and 
forms and there is no end to the variety.</p> 
<p>What are these trials? In this Epistle Pater makes it quite clear what he 
has in mind. Many of these Christians were being persecuted.</p> 
<p>(2 Tim 3:12) Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall 
suffer persecution.</p> 
<p>The world in its heart of hearts hates Christ and it hates the Christian, 
because such holy living condemns us.</p> 
<p>If we are to go on rejoicing in spite of the things that grieve us, we must 
approach them and face them all in the way in which the apostle instructs us.
</p> 
<p>What is his teaching? The first thing he does is to lay down a great 
principle, which is that we must understand why these things happen to us.</p> 
<p>There is a very definite plan and purpose for the whole of my life, God has 
looked upon me, God has adopted me and put me into His family. What for? In 
order that He may bring me to perfection.</p> 
<p>(Rom 8:29) For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to 
the image of his Son</p> 
<p>God permits these things to happen to us. God at times orders these things 
to happen to us for our good.</p> 
<p>He may do it sometimes in order to chastise us..for our slackness and for 
our failure..failure to discipline ourselves.</p> 
<p>(Heb 12:6) For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,</p> 
<p>Sometimes God does this to us to prepare us for something..when God has a 
particularly great task for a man to perform, He generally does try him.</p> 
<p>You may take the life of any man who has been signally used by God and you 
will find that there has been a severe time of testing and of trial in his 
experience.</p> 
<p>God sometimes prepares a man for a great trial in this way. I mean that He 
prepares him for a great trial by giving him some lesser trials.</p> 
<p>The second principle is the precious character of faith.</p> 
<p>Peter brings out his comparison with gold. Gold is precious but not as 
precious as faith.</p> 
<p>Gold perishes but faith does not. Faith is something that is everlasting 
and eternal.</p> 
<p>We walk by faith, the whole of our life is a matter of faith..this is so 
precious in the sight of God, it is marvelous, it is so wonderful that God 
wants it to be absolutely pure.</p> 
<p>You purify gold by fire.</p> 
<p>God tests us by trials as if by fire in order that the things which do not 
belong to the essence of faith may fall off.</p> 
<p>We naturally trust Him when He is smiling on us, but a day comes when the 
clouds are blackening the heavens and we begin to wonder whether God loves us 
any longer..</p> 
<p>Ah, our faith had not developed the element of trust, and God so deals with 
us in this life as to bring us to trust Him in the dark..</p> 
<p>That is true faith, that is real trust.</p> 
<p>It is exactly the same with the element of patience or patient endurance, 
the sheer capacity to go on and to keep on in spite of discouragement. That is 
one of the greatest tests a Christian can ever have.</p> 
<p>We are not patient by nature. We start as children in the Christian life 
and we want everything at once, and if it does not come, we become impatient 
and grumble, we complain and sulk like children.</p> 
<p>These trials are essential, says Peter, in order to show the genuineness of 
our faith.</p> 
<p>His actual phrase is &ndash; &lsquo;that the trial of your faith&rsquo;. 
Now &lsquo;trial&rsquo; there means &lsquo;the attestation of it&rsquo;. The 
picture he has oin mind is of a test being applied to something, and then after 
it has been tested a certificate is given.</p> 
<p>What is the consolation? It is that although these things happen to us, yet 
they only happen &lsquo;for a season&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>We shall never be tried and tested except it be for our good, and as we 
respond to the teaching, God will withdraw the test.</p> 
<p>God does not keep us permanently under trial.</p> 
<p>God will never send too much for you. He knows the right amount, and he 
will give the right amount, and when you have responded He will withdraw it.</p>
<p>Have you almost lost the faith you once had? Do not be troubled? You are in 
the hand of your Father. There may be a glorious period coming for you, He may 
have some unusual blessing for you, He may have some great work for you to do.
</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 17 Chastening </p> 
<p>(Heb 12:5) And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as 
unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint 
when thou art rebuked of him:</p> 
<p>(12:6) For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom 
he receiveth.</p> 
<p>(12:7) If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what 
son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</p> 
<p>(12:8) But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then 
are ye bastards, and not sons.</p> 
<p>(12:9) Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and 
we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the 
Father of spirits, and live?</p> 
<p>(12:10) For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own 
pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</p>
<p>(12:11) Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but 
grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of 
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</p> 
<p>(1 Thess 4:3) For this is the will of God, even your sanctification</p> 
<p>God&rsquo;s great concern for us primarily is not our happiness but our 
holiness. See Eph 1:4</p> 
<p>The whole of salvation is God&rsquo;s work from the beginning to end, and 
that God has His ways of producing it. Once God starts working He goes on with 
that work &ndash; &lsquo;He that hath begun a good work in you will perform it 
until the day of Jesus Christ&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>God does not start a work and then give it up or leave it in an incomplete 
condition &ndash; when God starts His work upon His people he is going to 
complete that work.</p> 
<p>God has several ways of doing this. </p> 
<p>One is to give us instruction through the great doctrines and principles 
that are taught in the Bible. He has given us His Word.</p> 
<p>And one of the other methods which He uses is this method of chastisement.
</p> 
<p>If we will not be obedient to the positive lessons and instructions of 
God&rsquo;s Word, we must not be surprised if other things begin to happen to 
us.</p> 
<p>We must not be surprised if we begin to endure certain things which are 
rather painful.</p> 
<p>These things are done to us deliberately by God as a part of the process of 
sanctification.</p> 
<p>What is chastisement, what does it mean? It means to train. </p> 
<p>It is the training through which a child is put, it is the method of 
training a child.</p> 
<p>It includes correction, instruction, rebuke, indeed it may include a good 
deal of punishment.</p> 
<p>The essential object of chastisement is to train and to develop the child 
so as to produce a grown person.</p> 
<p>How does God chastise His children?</p> Comment <br>

<p>Chapter 11 Looking at the waves</p> 
<p>Matthew 14:22-33</p> 
<p>&ldquo;And when Peter was down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to 
go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning 
to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth 
his hand, and caught him..&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The whole purpose of these Gospels is to portray Jesus.</p> 
<p>It is a failure in some shape or form to realize what He is that accounts 
for all our troubles.</p> 
<p>Peter produced his own doubts by looking at the waves.</p> 
<p>He led himself into difficulties which need not have arisen. It was not as 
though our Lord had said to Peter: &lsquo;Peter, be careful! Do you realize 
what you are doing?&rsquo; No, not a word from anybody; Peter by looking at the 
waves himself produced the doubts.</p> 
<p>We often lead ourselves into depression, we lead ourselves into doubts by 
dabbling with certain things which should be avoided.</p> 
<p>Doubts are not incompatible with faith.</p> 
<p>Our Lord said to Peter: &lsquo;O thou of little faith&rsquo;. He did not 
say: &lsquo;Peter, because you have doubts you have no faith at all&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Though you have faith, you may still be troubled by doubts..</p> 
<p>You may have doubts and still have faith, a weak faith.</p> 
<p>If doubts again control us, it is an indication of a weak faith. That was 
what happened to Peter. Doubt mastered him and overwhelmed him and he was 
shaken.</p> 
<p>Doubts will attack us, but that does not mean that we are to allow them to 
master us. We must never allow that.</p> 
<p>How do we avoid it? The antidote is &ndash; great faith.</p> 
<p>What are the characteristics of this great faith?</p> 
<p>The first is this &ndash; it is a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
His power, with a steady trust and confidence in that.</p> 
<p>The Christian faith begins and ends with a knowledge of the Lord. It begins 
with a knowledge of the Lord &ndash; not a feeling, not an act of the will, but 
a knowledge of this Blessed Person.</p> 
<p>Christianity is Christ, and Christian faith means believing things about 
Him and knowing Him, knowing that He is the Lord of Glory come down amongst us, 
knowing something about the Incarnation and the Virgin Birth, knowing why He 
came, knowing what He did when He came, knowing about His atoning work, knowing 
that He came, as He said Himself, not to call the righteous, but sinners to 
repentance&hellip;, knowing that &lsquo;His own self bare our sins in His body 
on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by 
whose stripes ye were healed.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>People are depressed because they do not know about these things as they 
should.</p> 
<p>Where there is a failure to know and believe these things, faith is weak.
</p> 
<p>So strong faith is to know them.</p> 
<p>The poor man was miserable and held in bondage. Why? Because he did not see 
that Christ is the Friend of publicans and sinners and that He came to die for 
such people.</p> 
<p>The great antidote to spiritual depression is the knowledge of Biblical 
doctrine, Christian doctrine.</p> 
<p>The antidote to depression is to have a knowledge of Him, and you get that 
in His Word.</p> 
<p>You must take the trouble to learn it. It is a difficult work, but you have 
to study it and give yourself to it.</p> 
<p>The tragedy of the hour ..is that people are far too dependent for their 
happiness upon meetings.</p> 
<p>Their knowledge of the truth is defective.</p> 
<p>John 8:31&nbsp;Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, &ldquo;If 
you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32&nbsp;And you shall know 
the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Free from doubts or fears, free from depression, free from things that get 
you down. It is truth that frees &ndash; the truth about Him, in His Person, in 
His work, in His offices, Christ as He is.</p> 
<p>Doubts are very foolish.</p> 
<p>That is always the trouble with weak faith, it comes back again to 
questions which it has already solved and answered.</p> 
<p>If you have ever believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, you must, in some shape 
or form, have met with and dealt with the difficulties or you would not have 
arrived at faith. Well, why go back? It is sheer folly. Not only is it a matter 
of unbelief, it is a question of conduct and behaviour.</p> 
<p>Having believed on Him you must shut the door to certain things and refuse 
to look at them. If you have dealt with them already, do not go back over them.
</p> 
<p>The next characteristic of faith is that it persists steadily in looking to 
Him and at Him.</p> 
<p>Phil 1:6&nbsp;being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a 
good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ;</p> 
<p>The beginning of the work is a miracle, so if He can initiate a miraculous 
work He can keep it going; what He has already begun He can continue.</p> 
<p>You and I can never doubt while we look at Him and are clear about Him. 
Without Him we are utterly hopeless.</p> 
<p>Without Him we can do nothing.</p> 
<p>We can only conquer our doubts by looking steadily at Him and by not 
looking at them.</p> 
<p>The way to answer them is to look at Him. The more you know Him and His 
glory the more ridiculous they will become.</p> 
<p>You cannot live on an initial faith.</p> 
<p>Do not try to live on your conversion.</p> 
<p>You cannot live on one climactic experience.<br>
 You must keep on looking 
to Him every day.</p> 
<p>You need Him as much as on your death-bed as you did on the night you were 
converted.</p> 
<p>You need Him all the time.</p> 
<p>He will never let you sink, because you belong to Him. You may fail Him, 
you may feel you are on the point of going down once and for ever, finally. 
Never &ndash; &lsquo;no man shall pluck them out of My hands&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Rom 8:38,39 (nothing) shall separate us from the love of God</p> 
<p>When you think you are lost His hand will be there and He will hold you.</p>
<p>Cry out in your desperation. Do not trade on that &ndash; but if you are 
alarmed cry out, and He will hear you and take you up.</p> 
<p>He can keep us from falling. We will need to cry out like that if we only 
keep on looking at Him. Believing in Him we shall never fall but keep straight 
on.</p> 
<p>If Peter had looked at Him he would have gone on walking on the sea, he 
would never have become distressed.</p> 
<p>Jude 24&nbsp;Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,<br>
 And to 
present you faultless<br>
 Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,
</p> 
<p>25&nbsp;To God our Savior,<br>
 Who alone is wise,<br>
 Be glory and 
majesty,<br>
 Dominion and power,<br>
 Both now and forever.<br>
 Amen.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 12 The Spirit of Bondage</p> 
<p>(Romans 8:15-17) For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; 
but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The 
Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God: 
and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so 
be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.</p> 
<p>These Epistles which we have in the NT are full of doctrine and of theology 
and yet it would be very wrong to say that the collection of NT Epistles is a 
text book of theology. It is not.</p> 
<p>These letters are pastoral letters written primarily because the Apostle 
was concerned to help people to an actual enjoyment and out-living of the 
Christian faith which they had believed and accepted.</p> 
<p>What does he mean by this &lsquo;spirit of bondage&rsquo;? He means the 
danger of having a &lsquo;servant spirit,&rsquo; a serf-like spirit and 
attitude.</p> 
<p>The slave attitude generally arises from the tendency to turn the Christian 
life and the living of the Christian life into a new law, into a higher law.</p>
<p>I am thinking of people who are quite clear about their relationship to the 
law &ndash; the Ten Commandments, or the moral law &ndash; as a way of 
salvation.</p> 
<p>They have seen clearly that Christ has delivered them from that, and that 
He alone could do so; they know that their own efforts will never enable them 
to fulfill the law.</p> 
<p>They see that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law; they are 
quite clear about their justification.</p> 
<p>However, they now begin to look positively at the Christian life, and they 
turn it into a new kind of law, with the result that they get into a spirit of 
bondage and of serfdom.</p> 
<p>They think of the Christian life as great task which they have to take up 
and to which now they are to apply themselves.</p> 
<p>They have read the Sermon of the Mount and realize that it is a portrayal 
of the Christian life, the life they desire to live.</p> 
<p>Holiness becomes a great task to them, and they begin to plan and organize 
their lives and introduce certain disciplines in order to enable them to carry 
it out.</p> 
<p>This attitude is seen in a classic manner in the Roman Catholic Church and 
her teaching, in the whole idea of monasticism, which is nothing but a great 
exhibition of this very thing.</p> 
<p>You cannot do that and continue in business or in some profession or indeed 
in the world at all. You must segregate yourself from the world.. That is the 
extreme form of this idea that holiness, and the cultivation of holiness and 
the spiritual life, is a whole-life occupation, and that you must devote 
yourself exclusively to it and have your rules, etc., to enable you to live.</p>
<p>That, according to the Apostle Paul, is nothing but a spirit of bondage. 
</p> 
<p>It is quite common among evangelical Christians.</p> 
<p>We can easily impose upon ourselves a new law. </p> 
<p>(Col 2:18-22) Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and 
worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly 
puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the 
body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increasing 
with the increase of God.</p> 
<p>If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though 
living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, Handle not, nor 
taste, nor touch</p> 
<p>(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and 
doctrines of men?</p> 
<p>(1 Tim 4:1-3) But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some 
shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines 
of demons,</p> 
<p>through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own 
conscience as with a hot iron;</p> 
<p>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God 
created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the 
truth.</p> 
<p>This &lsquo;spirit of bondage&rsquo; always brings with it and in its 
train, a spirit of fear.</p> 
<p>It tends to produce a wrong fear of God. There is a right fear of God..but 
there is also a wrong fear of God and that is a craven fear, &lsquo;a fear that 
hath torment&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>They regard God as taskmaster, they regard Him as Someone who is constantly 
watching to discover faults and blemishes in them, and to punish them 
accordingly.</p> 
<p>Others think of God only as a stern Law-giver far away in a distance.</p> 
<p>It is also a fear of the greatness of the task. </p> 
<p>That is why they think it can only be lived if one segregates oneself from 
the world, and that a man cannot possibly be in business, or engaged in any 
profession and live the Christian life.</p> 
<p>They tend to be afraid in a wrong way of the power of the devil. </p> 
<p>They are equally afraid of the sin which is within themselves. They spend 
their time in denouncing themselves and in talking about the blackness and 
darkness of their own hearts.</p> 
<p>This tendency of mourning, and always mourning and never rejoicing.. (If 
you did rejoice there was something wrong with you).</p> 
<p>What is the antidote to this condition?</p> 
<p>What is the answer? It is that we must realize the truth concerning the 
doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the 
Christian.</p> 
<p>(Rom 8:13) for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the 
Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p> 
<p>You must realize that you are not living by yourselves.</p> 
<p>You realize that you are forgiven, and you can thank God that your sons are 
blotted out and washed away, but you seem to think that is all and that you are 
left to live the Christian life on your own. If you think like that, you are in 
a spirit of fear and bondage.</p> 
<p>It means that you just have a new law which is infinitely more difficult 
than the old law.</p> 
<p>But that is not the position, for the Holy Spirit dwells within you.</p> 
<p>(Rom 8:3) For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the 
flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, 
condemned sin in the flesh:</p> 
<p>He means that the law could not save anybody, the law could not enable 
anybody to live the Christian life, for the reason that the law is weak, 
because of the weakness of my flesh.</p> 
<p>The law was given, but that man in and of himself is asked to keep it. The 
weakness of the flesh is in the man, not in the law. The law is not weak, it is 
the man who has to carry it out who is weak.</p> 
<p>If we impose upon ourselves in this Christian life a new law which you and 
I have to keep in our own strength, we are doomed to failure.</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit is in you and He will empower you and strengthen you. </p> 
<p>(Phil 2:13) for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for 
his good pleasure.</p> 
<p>We are to realize that the Spirit of God is in us. We must look to Him, we 
must seek His aid, we must rely upon Him.</p> 
<p>That does not mean that we are to be passive. It means we believe, that as 
we are wrestling, He is empowering us. We would not be bothered to exert 
ourselves unless He had prompted us to do so. He works in us and we work it 
out, and we realize this, the task is not impossible.</p> 
<p>The Spirit that enabled Jesus will enable us. That is his argument. </p> 
<p>The presence of the Holy Spirit in us reminds us of our relationship to God.
</p> 
<p>The presence of the Holy Spirit within us reminds us of our sonship, yes, 
our adult sonship.</p> 
<p>We are not infants, the very term means that we are grown sons and have 
reached full age. We are sons in the fullest sense and in the possession of all 
our faculties.</p> 
<p>Our object in living the Christian life is not simply to attain a certain 
standard, but is rather to please God because He is our Father..we cry Abba, 
Father.</p> 
<p>The slave was not allowed to say &lsquo;Abba&rsquo; and ..he regards God as 
a Judge who condemns.</p> 
<p>As Christian people we must learn to appropriate by faith the fact that God 
is our Father.</p> 
<p>He is our Father and He is always caring for us, He loves us with an 
everlasting love, He so loved us that He sent His only begotten Son into this 
world and to the Cross to die for our sins.</p> 
<p>Henceforth m desire is not to keep the law but to please my Father.</p> 
<p>Our Christian living is not a matter of rules and regulations any longer, 
but rather our desire to show Him our gratitude for all He has ever done for us.
</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit within us reminds us of our destiny. </p> 
<p>(Rom 8:17a) and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with 
Christ</p> 
<p>(Rom 8:38-39) For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, 
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</p> 
<p>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us 
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> 
<p>If you are a child of God, you are destined for heaven and for glory, and 
that all the things you see inside yourself and outside yourself cannot prevent 
that plan from being carried out.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 8 False Teaching</p> 
<p>(Gal 4:15) Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you 
witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them 
to me.</p> 
<p>That was the trouble with the churches in Galatia; all their problems 
emanated from a certain false teaching which they had believed.</p> 
<p>False teaching can appear in many different forms..</p> 
<p>Sometimes it takes the form of a blatant denial of the Truth and of the 
cardinal principles and tenets of the Christian faith.</p> 
<p>There is another form.. That was the peculiar form which it took in the 
case of Galatia.</p> 
<p>Certain teachers had gone around to churches there and said, in effect: 
&lsquo;Yes, we believe the gospel and we agree with Paul&rsquo;s teaching. It 
is perfectly right, everything he said was right, but he did not go far enough. 
He left out something that is absolutely vital and that vital something is 
circumcision. Hold on to everything you believe but if you want to be a true 
Christian you must in addition be circumcised&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>(Gal 1:8-9) But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you 
any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.</p> 
<p> As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you 
any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.</p> 
<p>(Gal 5:1) For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be 
not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</p> 
<p>How do we face this kind of position? The first thing the Apostle lays down 
is the question of authority.</p> 
<p>False teaching can make people very happy.. If you judge only in terms of 
experience and results you will find that every cult and heresy the world or 
the Church has ever known will be able to justify itself.</p> 
<p>What, then, is the authority?</p> 
<p>(Gal 1:11-12) For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel 
which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</p> 
<p>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to 
me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>When Paul spoke to the other apostles at Jerusalem he found he was 
preaching exactly the same gospel as they were preaching.</p> 
<p>The test of Truth is Apostolicity. Is it, and does it conform to, the 
apostolic message?</p> 
<p>The gospel of Jesus Christ as announced and taught in the NT claims nothing 
less than that it comes with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself Who 
gave it to these men who, in turn, preached it and caused it to be written. 
Here is the only standard.</p> 
<p>There is an apostolic message, a positive Truth agreed upon by all the 
apostles and preached by them &ndash; there is that definite message.</p> 
<p>Now false teaching may be guilty of stating less than that message, of 
leaving out certain things.</p> 
<p>It may be less than the true teaching on the Person of the Lord Jesus 
Christ..</p> 
<p>It may deny at some point the work of Christ. It may deny the fact that </p>
<p>(2 Cor 5:21) Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we 
might become the righteousness of God in him.</p> 
<p>It may describe the death of Christ as being nothing but a marvelous 
exhibition of love.</p> 
<p>It may deny that God punished our sins &lsquo;in His own body on the 
tree&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>That is what the apostles preached, that Christ &lsquo;died for&rsquo; our 
sins.</p> 
<p>People may say they believe on Christ, but then they tend to deduce that if 
you believe in Christ you are safe and it does not matter what you do. But that 
is the terrible error of antinomianism. &lsquo;Faith without works is 
dead&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>The second danger is the exact opposite, namely, the danger of adding to 
the Truth..</p> 
<p>False teaching always emphasizes some one thing in particular and gives 
great prominence to it. Here in the case of Galatians it was circumcision.</p> 
<p>False teaching is always &lsquo;Christ plus&rsquo; something, and you must 
have this essential addition.</p> 
<p>Wrong doctrine always leads in some shape or form to the conclusion that 
faith alone is not enough.</p> 
<p>These false teachings are always telling us that we must do something 
ourselves; we must add on some plus, some action on our part, or allow 
something to be done to us. Faith is not enough. We do not stand by faith, and 
justification is not by faith only. We have to do some certain work, we have to 
do something special before we can get this great experience of salvation.</p> 
<p>But according to Paul, to say such things means that we are &lsquo;fallen 
from grace&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>To believe in such false teaching always leads to denying former Christian 
experience.</p> 
<p>That is the meaning of his whole argument about Abraham. Abraham was blest, 
not after circumcision but before circumcision. To say that circumcision is 
essential is therefore to deny this experience.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 9 Weary in well doing</p> 
<p>(Gal. 6:9) And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we 
shall reap, if we faint not.</p> 
<p>Here we have the case of those who are on the right road and facing the 
right way. They are moving in the right direction but the troble is that they 
are shuffling along with drooping heads and hands and the whole spectacle and 
picture they present is the very antithesis of what the Christian is meant to 
be in this life and world.</p> 
<p>That is what we may call the danger of the middle period.</p> 
<p>It is the problem of middle life..middle age.</p> 
<p>As we grow older, our resilience and our vigor tend to go..slowing down and 
a slackening in our powers.</p> 
<p>This is equally true in the religious or the spiritual life.</p> 
<p>No longer are we surprised at things, as we were at the beginning, because 
we are familiar with them and know about them.</p> 
<p>All the thrill of new discovery which animated us in the early stages 
suddenly seems to have gone.</p> 
<p>Trials and difficulties and troubles at a time when we ourselves are in 
this critical period, we become wear in well doing.</p> 
<p>Some of these Galatian Christians had arrived at that particular point.</p> 
<p>Whenever we are found in this position of weariness..there are certain 
negatives that are absolutely all-important.</p> 
<p>The first is this: Whatever you may feel about it don not consider the 
suggestion that comes to you from all directions..that you should give up, or 
give way, or give in. You must say to yourself: &lsquo;Whatever happens I am 
going on&rsquo;. You do not give in or give way.</p> 
<p>The second negative: Do not resign yourself to it.</p> 
<p>The danger of the majority at this point is just to resign themselves to it 
and to lose heart and to lose hope. They will go on, but they go on in this 
hopeless, dragging condition.</p> 
<p>They say something like this: &lsquo;Well, I have lost that something which 
I had.. But I am going on, and out of loyalty I will go on, as a sheer duty. I 
have lost the enjoyment I once had, that is gone.. I will resign myself to my 
fate, I won&rsquo;t be a quitter.. I will go on..just shuffling down the 
road..&rsquo;</p> 
<p>That is the spirit of resignation, stoicism if you like, putting up with it.
</p> 
<p>The third negative..we will resort to artificial stimulants. </p> 
<p>Many a man had ended as a drunkard..and people take to drugs and various 
other things.</p> 
<p>I have seen people in the church dealing with this general spiritual 
weariness in that very way.</p> 
<p>They work up some kind of excitement or they adopt new methods.. They put 
up some new program.</p> 
<p>Such churches are obviously living on artificial stimulants..</p> 
<p>The pastor or some other responsible person has said: &lsquo;We are just in 
a rut, we are becoming rather dead. What can we do about it? Well, let&rsquo;s 
do this or that. It will provide work and activity, it will be a new 
interest&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Let us now turn to positive. </p> 
<p>The first thing must be self-examination. Sit down and say to yourself: 
&lsquo;Well, now, why am I weary, what is the cause of my weariness?&rsquo;</p> 
<p>There are many possible answers to the question. </p> 
<p>You may be working too hard physically. You can be tired in the work and 
not tired of the work. It is possible that a man has been over-working.</p> 
<p>We may have been living the Christian life, or doing the Christian work, by 
means of carnal energy..instead of working in the power of the Spirit.</p> 
<p>I must ask myself why I have been doing this work and what has really been 
my motive.</p> 
<p>Self says that we are important. We have to admit that it has not all been 
for the glory of God, but for our glory.</p> 
<p>We like to see results and we like it to appear in the papers and so on 
&ndash; self has come in and self is a terrible master.</p> 
<p>If we are working to satisfy and please self in any shape or form, the end 
is always going to be weariness and tiredness.</p> 
<p>Lastly, has this work kept me going? One of the greatest dangers I the 
spiritual life is to live on your own activities.</p> 
<p>These kept them going, and then when they were taken ill or grew old, and 
could no longer do what they used to do they became depressed.</p> 
<p>Let me put the matter positively. </p> 
<p>In the first place, there are phases in the Christian life as in the whole 
life.</p> 
<p>John writes his first epistle to little children and young men and old men.
</p> 
<p>Feelings, perhaps, are the most variable.</p> 
<p>Come to the second principle. &lsquo;Let us not be weary in well 
doing.&rsquo; It is &lsquo;well doing&rsquo; remember.</p> 
<p>The Christian life is a life of well doing.</p> 
<p>The Christian life is not a task.</p> 
<p>The next principle is that this life of ours on earth is but a preparatory 
one. &lsquo;..for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Put your life in the context of eternity.</p> 
<p>And above all let us consider the Master for Whom we work. Let us remember 
how He endured and how patient He was.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 15 Discipline</p> 
<p>(2 Peter 1:5) Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all 
diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge;</p> 
<p>(1:6) and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control 
patience; and in your patience godliness;</p> 
<p>(1:7) and in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your brotherly 
kindness love.</p> 
<p>There are Christians &ndash; why they unlike other Christians who are 
faithful, and whose lives are effective and living and life-giving &ndash; what 
is the difference? That is a lack of discipline.</p> 
<p>It is a sheer absence of discipline and order in their life.</p> 
<p>Why are these people lacking of discipline in their lives, why is this 
slackness, this indolence so apparent in their lives?</p> 
<p>The first cause seems to be that they have a wrong view of faith.</p> 
<p>In the 5th verse, Peter says supplement your faith, furnish out your faith 
with the things which he then proceeds to mention.</p> 
<p>They have a wrong view of faith. They seem to have had a kind of magical 
view of faith; that as long as you have faith all is well, that your faith will 
work automatically in your life, and that all you need to do as a Christian is 
just to believe the truth.</p> 
<p>That you must accept the faith and having done that all the rest will 
happen to you..</p> 
<p>Such people do not realize that faith needs to be supplemented by virtue, 
knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity.</p> 
<p>The second general cause of this condition is sheer laziness or indolence, 
lack of diligence.</p> 
<p>Have we not all noticed when we have been working quite well that somehow 
if we turn for a season of prayer, we suddenly feel tired and fatigued.</p> 
<p>Is it not curious that we always become tired and sleepy when we want to 
read the Bible?</p> 
<p>It assumes the form of procrastination.</p> 
<p>The most difficult thing in life is to order your own life and to manage it.
</p> 
<p>We do not realize the danger of drifting and put a stand against it.</p> 
<p>There are so many things to distract us.</p> 
<p>What is the treatment?</p> 
<p>First and foremost he emphasizes &lsquo;all diligence.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Make every effort.</p> 
<p>I defy you to read the life of any saint that has ever adorned the life of 
the Church without seeing at once that the greatest characteristic in the life 
of that saint was discipline and order.</p> 
<p>Read about Henry Martyn, David Brainerd, Jonathan Edwards, the brothers 
Wesley, and Whitfield &ndash; read their journals.</p> 
<p>They have all disciplined their lives and have insisted upon the need for 
this; and obviously it is something that is thoroughly scriptural and 
absolutely essential.</p> 
<p>The error of justification by works is in trusting to the discipline of 
your own works to save your soul; but the opposite to trusting your works is 
not to do nothing; it is to do everything but not to put your trust in any of 
it. It is not the works that are wrong, it is the faith in your works, trusting 
your works.</p> 
<p>It seems to me that one of the chief dangers in Protestantism today..in our 
fear of the error of justification by works, we have been saying that works do 
not matter at all.</p> 
<p>We argue that faith alone counts, and because I am a man of faith it does 
not matter what I do and my life can be thoroughly lacking of discipline.</p> 
<p>The opposite to a false trust in works is not indolence, lack of discipline 
and doing nothing, it is to be diligent and more diligent, to be zealous, and 
to add to your faith.</p> 
<p>God is certainly a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.</p> 
<p>In other words if I really believe that the Bible is more important to me 
than the daily newspaper, I must read my Bible before I read the newspaper.</p> 
<p>My prayer time must be insisted upon, I must have my time for meditation.
</p> 
<p>Whatever else is not done, I must do these things.</p> 
<p>That is the beginning that is an illustration of an element of order coming 
back into life.</p> 
<p>This word &lsquo;furnish&rsquo; is a Greek word that was used in connection 
with the performance of a drama. It means the providing of a kind of orchestra 
or chorus, so that it may be complete. It was something that rounded off the 
performance and made it a perfect performance.</p> 
<p>That is the meaning of the word, add to it, furnish it, supplement it, make 
the thing complete, let it be a full-orbed faith.</p> 
<p>What do you add to faith?</p> 
<p>Virtue here means energy, moral energy, it means power, it means vigor.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t shuffle through your Christian life, walk through it as you 
should do with vigor.</p> 
<p>Do not be a languid Christian, on the point of swooning and fainting and 
might fail at any moment.</p> 
<p>Knowledge does not simply mean knowledge of doctrine.</p> 
<p>This means a kind of insight, it means understanding, it means 
enlightenment.</p> 
<p>How essential it is that we should give ourselves to a diligent reading of 
the Scriptures and of books on the Scriptures and on the doctrines of the faith.
</p> 
<p>The student never becomes proficient in any subject without hard work.</p> 
<p>It needs discipline and application.</p> 
<p>Temperance. It means that you will have to control every single aspect of 
your life. It may mean you will have to control even your eating and your 
drinking.</p> 
<p>Many people are in a poor state of physical health because they eat and 
drink too much.</p> 
<p>There are people who suffer from tiredness and lethargy. </p> 
<p>They do not control their appetites, their lusts, their passions, their 
desires; they eat too much, or drink too much, or even sleep too much.</p> 
<p>Patience means patient endurance, to keep on though everything discourages 
you.</p> 
<p>Do you realize that you are partakers of the divine nature?</p> 
<p>Do you realize that the Son of God came from heaven to earth and went even 
to the Cross of Calvary to save you, to deliver you from the world and its lust?
</p> 
<p>For this very cause then give all diligence.</p> 
<p>How shall we that are dead unto sin live any longer therein?</p> Comment

<p>Chapter 6 Vain Regrets</p> 
<p>1 Corinthians 15:8-10<br>
 8 And last of all He was seen by me also, as one 
born out of time.<br>
 9 For I am the least of the apostles and am not 
sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.<br>

 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which was toward me 
has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them; yet 
not I, but the grace of God with me.</p> 
<p>The moment you become Christian we become subjected to the most subtle and 
powerful assaults of one who is described in the Bible as &lsquo;the prince of 
the power of the air&rsquo;, &lsquo;the spirit who now ruleth in the children 
of disobedience&rsquo;, &lsquo;the god of this world&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;Satan&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>While it is perfectly right for such people to regret the fact they have 
been slow to believe, it is quite wrong to be miserable about it. You cannot 
look back across your past life without seeing things to regret.</p> 
<p>All along we have to draw subtle distinctions and here is one of them, the 
distinction between a legitimate regret and a wrong condition of dejection and 
of misery.</p> 
<p>Matt 20:1-16</p> 
<p>To be miserable in the present because of some failure in the past is a 
ssheer waste of time and energy.</p> 
<p>They are wasting their time and energy in vain regrets about things which 
they cannot change or undo, a purely foolish and irrational thing to do even 
from the mundane standard of common sense.</p> 
<p>We must never for a second worry about anything that cannot be affected or 
changed by us. It is a waste of energy.. It is the devil defeating you.</p> 
<p>To dwell on the past simply causes failure in the present.</p> 
<p>While you are sitting down and bemoaning the past and regretting all the 
things you have not done, you are crippling yourself and preventing yourself 
from working in the present.</p> 
<p>Christianity is common sense and much more ..</p> 
<p>It is always wrong to mortgage the present by the past, it is always wrong 
to allow the past to act as a brake upon the present. Let the dead past bury 
its dead.</p> 
<p>They are so sorry about the past that they do nothing in the present.</p> 
<p>If ou bemoan a wasted past, make up for it in the present, give yourself 
entirely to living at this present moment.</p> 
<p>Paul says in effect: I have wasted a lot of time, others have got ahead of 
me. But he is able to go on and to add: &lsquo;I labored more abundantly than 
they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>The Christian never less than the unbeliever, he is always more. He should 
have all the common sense and wisdom of the unbeliever, but he has something 
more in addition.</p> 
<p>That is what made Paul an apostle, that he was a witness to the fact of the 
resurrection.</p> 
<p>What matters first of all if you are a Christian is not what you once were, 
but what you are.</p> 
<p>Certainly there is the past with all its sins. But say this to yourself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br>
 Who like me His praise 
should sing.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;I am what I am&rsquo; &ndash; whatever the past may have been.</p> 
<p>What am I? I am forgiven. I am reconciled to God by the Blood of His Son 
upon the Cross. I am a child of God. I am adopted into God&rsquo;s family, and 
I am an heir with Christ, a joint-heir with Him. I am going to glory.</p> 
<p>It is not the time of your entry into the Kingdom that matters but the fact 
that you are in the Kingdom.</p> 
<p>Nothing matters in the Kingdom but the grace of God.</p> 
<p>In the Kingdom of God and of Christ the standpoint is that of grace, and 
off grace alone; and it cuts across all other regulations.</p> 
<p>It is His grace that matters &ndash; &lsquo;by grace I am what I am&rsquo;. 
So stop looking at what you have not done and the years you have missed and 
realize that in His Kingdom it is His grace alone that matters.</p> 
<p>You who have come last may find yourselves first one day to your own 
amazement, and like the people in the parable at the end of Matt 25, you will 
ask: &lsquo;When did I do thiss, when did I do that?&rsquo; He knows, He sees, 
His grace is sufficient.</p> 
<p>Ecclesiastes 11:6<br>
 6 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening 
do not withhold your hand; for you do not know what shall be blessed, either 
this or that, or whether they both shall be fruitful in the same way.</p> 
<p>The question of age is irrelevant in God&rsquo;s kingdom and it is 
unscriptural to emphaasize it as we do.</p> 
<p>Joel 2:25<br>
 25 And I will restore to you the years which the swarming 
locust has eaten,</p> 
<p>He has promised to do it; He can do it. The wasted years, the barren years, 
the years that the locusts and the canker worms and the caterpillars and all 
these other thing have devoured, until there was nothing apparently left, of 
them He says: I will restore to you the years the locust hath eaten.</p> 
<p>He comes in and He can give us a crop in one year that will make up for ten.
</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 7 Fear of the Future</p> 
<p>2 Timothy 1:7<br>
 7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of 
power and of love and of a sound mind.</p> 
<p>God purposed and planned aa great way of redemption. This is beyond any 
question the outstanding glory of God. Redemption is a greater even than 
creation, and especially when we consider the way in which God has achieved it, 
even through the sending of His only Begotten Son, into this world in all 
marvel and the wonder and the miracle of the Incarnation, but above all in 
delivering him up to the Death upon the Cross.</p> 
<p>This is the supreme thing &ndash; that sinful fallen man can be redeemed 
and restored, and ultimately the whole of creation also.</p> 
<p>Obviously, therefore, the supreme concern of the adversary, the devil, the 
opponent, is to endeavor somehow or other, to bring this work of God to 
discredit and dishonor.</p> 
<p>To this end he makes a special object of attacking the heirs of salvation, 
Christian people, and there is nothing which so suits his purpose as to depress 
us and to bring us down, to give the impression that this boasted salvation is 
but a figment of the imagination.. And what better way of doing that than to 
bring us into a condition that we give the impression of being depressed, 
burdened and miserable?</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 8 Feelings</p> 
<p>2 Timothy 1:6<br>
 6 For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou 
stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p>You cannot read through your New Testament without seeing at a glance that 
joy is meant to be the most striking things that conversion does is to take us 
out of some horrible pit, some miry clay and establish our feet upon a rock, 
and establish our goings and to put a new song in our mouth.</p> 
<p>Feelings are meant to be engaged, and when the gospel comes to us it does 
involved the whole man. It moves his mind. He sees its glorious truth, it moves 
his heart in the same way, and it movess his will.</p> 
<p>Your business and mine is not to stir up our feelings, it is to believe. We 
are never told anywhere in Scripture that we are saved by our feelings; we are 
told we are saved by believing.</p> 
<p>&lsquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.&rsquo; 
Never once are feelings put into the primary position.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 9 Laborers in the Vineyard</p> 
<p>Matt 20:1-16</p> 
<p>This parable, like other parables, is meant to teach one great truth. What 
is that? The answer is to be found in the word &lsquo;FOR&rsquo; &ndash; 
&lsquo;For the Kingdom of Heaven&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>The whole point of this parable is addressed to Peter because off that 
claim which he made (Matt 19).</p> 
<p>Here, then, is the principle on which we much concentrate. What is it? What 
is the doctrine? It is that in the Christian life all is of grace from the very 
beginning to the very end. That is the message, that is the doctrine, that is 
the principle.</p> 
<p>The point about these people is that they started in the right way and then 
got into trouble later on. How often does that happen! That is why it is dealt 
with so frequently in the NT in such phrases as: &ldquo;You did run well, who 
hinder you?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We must say to ourselves every day of our lives: &lsquo;Now I am a 
Christian, and because I am a Christian I am in the Kingdom of God and all my 
thinking has got to be different. Everything here is different. I must not 
bring with me those old ideas, those old moods and concepts of thought&rsquo;.
</p> 
<p>We tend to confine salvation to one thing, namely to forgiveness, but we 
have to apply the principle throughout the Christian life.</p> 
<p>The first thing is this. Do not think in terms of bargains and rights in 
the Kingdom of God. That is absolutely fatal.</p> 
<p>There is nothing so wrong as the spirit which argues that because I do 
this, or because I do that, I have a right to expect something else in return.
</p> 
<p>I know very good many evangelical Christian people, who seem to be thinking 
like that. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;if we pray for certain things, 
we are bound to have them, for instance if we pray all night for revival we 
must have revival.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>I have sometimes described this as the &lsquo;penny in the slot&rsquo; idea 
of Christianity. You put in our coin and you draw out a bar of chocolate or 
whatever else you want.</p> 
<p>I do not care what it is, whether prayer or anything else, in no respect 
must I ever argue that because I do something I am entitled to get something 
&ndash; never.</p> 
<p>What would the position be if we command these things at will? But we 
cannot. Let us get rid of this of this bargaining spirit, that if I do this 
then that will happen.</p> 
<p>Everything is of grace in the Christian life from the very beginning to the 
very end. To think in terms of bargains and to murmur at results, implies a 
distrust of Him, and we need to watch our own spirits lest we harbor the 
thought that He is not dealing with us justly and fairly.</p> 
<p>The secret of a happy Christian life is to realize that it is all of grace 
and to rejoice in that fact.</p> 
<p>Luke 17:10<br>
 10 Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things 
that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that 
which it was our duty to do.</p> 
<p>That is the secret. Not watching the clock, not assessing the amount of 
work, not keeping a record in a book, but forgetting everything except the 
glory of god, the privilege of being called to work for Him at all, the 
privilege of being a Christian, remembering only the grace that has ever looked 
upon us and removed us from darkness to light.</p> 
<p>It is grace at the beginning, grace at the end. So that when you and I come 
to lie upon our deathbeds, the one thing that should comfort and help and 
strengthen us there is the thing that helped us at the beginning. Not what we 
have been, not what we have done, but the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p> 
<p>The Christian life starts with grace, it must continue with grace, it ends 
with grace. Grace, wondrous grace.</p> 
<p>1 Corinthians 15:10<br>
 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his 
grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more 
abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 10 Where is your faith?</p> 
<p>Luke 8:22-25</p> 
<p>&ldquo;He said to them, Let us go over to the other side.. And there came 
down a storm of wind ..and were in jeopardy ..saying, Master, Master, we perish.
</p> 
<p>What makes one a Christian is that one is given the gift of faith. We are 
given the gift of faith by God through the Holy Spirit and we believe on the 
Lord Jesus Christ and that saves us; but that does not mean that we have fully 
understood the nature of faith.</p> 
<p>Vital importance of distinguishing between the original gift of faith and 
the walk of faith, or the life of faith which comes subsequently.</p> 
<p>If you do not believe in the unique deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, you are 
not a Christian, whatever else you may be. We are not looking at a good Man 
only, we are not interested merely in the greatest Teacher the world has ever 
seen; we are face to face with the fact that God, the Eternal Son, has been in 
this world and that He took upon Him human-nature and dwelt amongst us, a Man 
among men &ndash; God-Man.</p> 
<p>He rebukes them because of their alarm, because of their terror, because of 
their lack of faith.</p> 
<p>He was rebuking them for being in such a state at all. &lsquo;Where is your 
faith?&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Matthew puts it: &lsquo;O ye of little faith.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>He rebuked them for being in that state of agitation and terror and alarm 
while He was with them in the boat.</p> 
<p>It is wrong for a Christian ever to be in such a condition. I do not care 
what the circumstances may be, the Christian should never be agitated, the 
Christian should never be beside himself like this, the Christian should never 
be at his wit&rsquo;s end, the Christian should never be in a condition in 
which he has lost control of himself.</p> 
<p>A Christian should never, like the worldly person, be depressed, agitated, 
alarmed, frantic, not knowing what to do.</p> 
<p>The Christian is different from other people, the Christian has something 
which the non-Christian does not possess, and the ideal for the Christian is 
that which is stated so perfectly by the Apostle Paul:</p> 
<p>Phil 4:11, 13</p> 
<p>11&nbsp;..for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: 
13&nbsp;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</p> 
<p>The Christian is never meant to be carried away by his feelings, whatever 
they are &ndash; never. That is always wrong in a Christian. He is always to be 
controlled..</p> 
<p>The second lesson: what is so wrong about being in this condition is that 
it implies a lack of trust and of confidence in Him.</p> 
<p>I do not think that they were referring only to themselves or to their own 
safety.</p> 
<p>I believe they were including Him as well, that they thought they were all 
going to be drowned.</p> 
<p>This agitation and alarm always carries with it a lack of implicit trust 
and confidence in Him. It is a lack of faith in His concern for us and in His 
care for us. It means that we take charge and are going to look after the 
situation ourselves, feeling either that He does not care, or perhaps that He 
cannot do anything.</p> 
<p>That is what makes this so terrible, but I wonder whether we always realize 
it.</p> 
<p>Scripture is full of this idea of the trial of one&rsquo;s faith. Hebrews 
11. Everyone of those men was tried.</p> 
<p>1Peter 1:6-7</p> 
<p>6&nbsp;In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need 
be, you have been grieved by various trials, 7&nbsp;that the genuineness of 
your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is 
tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of 
Jesus Christ</p> 
<p>If we are living the Christian life, or trying to live the Christian life, 
at the moment, on the assumption that it means just come to Christ and you will 
never have any more worry in the whole of your life, we are harboring a 
terrible fallacy. In fact it is a delusion and it is not true.</p> 
<p>James (1:2) Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of 
many kinds,</p> 
<p>God permits storms, He permits difficulties, He permits the wind to blow 
and the billows to roll, and everything may seem to be going wrong and we 
ourselves to be in jeopardy.</p> 
<p>Phil 1:29; John 16:33; Acts 14:22</p> 
<p>The fact that God permits these things and that He often appears to be 
quite unconcerned about it all really constitutes what I am describing as the 
trial of faith.</p> 
<p>What is the nature of faith, the character of faith?</p> 
<p>&lsquo;Where is your faith?&rsquo; It seems to imply that He knows 
perfectly well that they have faith.</p> 
<p>You have got faith, where is it?</p> 
<p>Faith is not a mere matter of feeling.</p> 
<p>Faith is not something that acts automatically, faith is not something that 
acts magically.</p> 
<p>Faith is an activity. It is something that has to be exercised.</p> 
<p>Faith is something we have to bring to operation.</p> 
<p>He said: &lsquo;Where is your faith?&rsquo; Which means, &lsquo;Why are you 
not taking your faith and applying it to this position?&rsquo;</p> 
<p>The first thing. I must do when I find myself in a difficult situation is 
to refuse to allow myself to be controlled by the situation.</p> 
<p>&lsquo;No, we are not going to panic&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Faith is a refusal to panic, come what may.</p> 
<p>Having taken the first step, having pulled yourself up, you remind yourself 
of what you believe and what you know.</p> 
<p>Is it possible we are going to drown with Him in the boat? Is there 
anything He cannot do? We have seen His miracles, He turned water to wine, He 
can heal the blind and the lame, He can even raise the dead, is it likely that 
He is going to allow us and Himself to be drowned in this way? Impossible!</p> 
<p>That is faith, it holds on to the truth and reasons from what it knows to 
be fact. That is the way to apply faith.</p> 
<p>Romans 5:10</p> 
<p>Faith says: &lsquo;I cannot believe that He who has brought me so far is 
going to let me down at this point. It is impossible, it would be inconsistent 
with the character of God.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>The next step is that faith applies all that to the particular situation.
</p> 
<p>Whatever your circumstances at this moment, bring all you know to be true 
of your relationship with God to bear upon it.</p> 
<p>The One who has done the greatest thing of all for you, must be concerned 
about you in everything, and though the clouds are thick and you cannot see His 
face, you know He is there.</p> 
<p>The value of even the weakest or smallest faith .. However poor and small 
and however incomplete the faith of these disciples was on this occasion, they 
at any rate had a sufficient amount of faith to make do the right thing in the 
end. They went to Him.</p> 
<p>He will let us know that He was disappointed in us and He will rebuke us; 
but, blessed be His name, He will nevertheless still receive us. He does not 
drive us away.</p> 
<p>He will neglect us; He will receive us, He will bless us, He will give us 
peace.</p> Comment <br>

<h2>Quotes from Martyn Lloyd-Jones &ndash; Spiritual Depression: Its Causes 
and Cure (Chap&nbsp;1-5)</h2>  Filed under: Martyn Lloyd-Jones &mdash; Leave a

<p>Chapter 1 General Consideration</p> 
<p>Psalms 42:5<br>
 5 Why are you cast down, O my soul,<br>
 and why are you 
in turmoil within me?<br>
 Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,<br>
 my 
salvation</p> 
<p>Psalms 42:11<br>
 11 Why are you cast down, O my soul,<br>
 and why are you 
in turmoil within me?<br>
 Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,<br>
 my 
salvation and my God.</p> 
<p>It does not matter what we are by temperament; we are all saved in the way, 
by the same act of God in and through His Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
</p> 
<p>In a sense, and in the last analysis, that is the one and only cause of 
spiritual depression &ndash; it is the devil, the adversary of our souls. He 
can use our temperaments and our physical condition.</p> 
<p>The devil&rsquo;s one object is so depress God&rsquo;s people that he can 
go to the man of the world and say: There are God&rsquo;s people. Do you want 
to be like that?</p> 
<p>Obviously the whole strategy of the adversary of our souls, and God&rsquo;s 
adversary, is to depress us and to make us look as this man looked when he was 
passing through this period of unhappiness.</p> 
<p>The ultimate cause of all spiritual depression is unbelief. For if it were 
not for unbelief even the devil could do nothing. It is because we listen to 
the devil instead of listening to God that we go down before him and fall 
before his attacks.</p> 
<p>You must go on to remind yourself of God, Who God is, and what God is and 
what God has done, and what God has pledged Himself to do.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 2 The True Foundation</p> 
<p>Romans 3:28<br>
 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith 
without the works of the law.</p> 
<p>The Christian life seems to them to be a constant problem, and they are 
always asking the same question. &ldquo;Why cannot I get there? Why cannot I be 
like that?&rdquo; They read books which are meant to give instructions about 
the Christian way of life, they attend meetings and conferences, always seeking 
this something which they do not find. And they are cast down, their souls are 
cast down and disquieted within them.</p> 
<p>I am suggesting that they are what I would call miserable Christians, 
simply because they have not understood the way of salvation, and for that 
reason all their beliefs and efforts have been more or less useless.</p> 
<p>They often concentrate on the question of sanctification, but it does not 
help them because they have not understood justification.</p> 
<p>They have assumed that they are right about the first things, but they 
never have been right about their justification, and it is just here that the 
devil causes confusion. It suits him well that such people should be concerned 
about sanctification and holiness and various other things, but they can never 
be right until they are right here, and that is why we must start with this.</p>
<p>It is no use going on to deal with the superstructure if the foundation is 
not right.</p> 
<p>This confusion is old trouble. In a sense it is the masterpiece of Satan. 
He will even encourage us to be righteous as long as he has us confused at this 
point.</p> 
<p>That he is doing so in this present time is clear from the fact that the 
average person in the Church seems to regard men as Christian simply because 
they do good works, even though they may be entirely wrong about this 
preliminary truth.</p> 
<p>It is an old trouble, and it was the essential trouble with the Jews. It is 
what our Lord was continually saying to the Pharisees, and it certainly was the 
major argument which the Apostle Paul had with the Jews.</p> 
<p>They were entirely wrong with regard to the whole question of the Law, and 
the main problem was to show them the right view of it.</p> 
<p>The Jews believed that the Law was made by God in order that man might save 
himself by keeping it. They said that all one had to do was to keep the Law, 
and that if you kept the Law you would justify yourself, and that if you led 
your life according to the Law, God would accept you and you would be well 
pleasing in His sight.</p> 
<p>And they believed that they could do that, because they had never 
understood the Law.</p> 
<p>The one thing Paul was anxious to make clear was this message about the 
righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>Romans 1:16,17<br>
 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it 
is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first 
and also to the Greek.<br>
 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed 
from faith to faith, as it is written,&rdquo;The just shall live by 
faith.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Why did not everybody believe that?</p> 
<p>The answer is that they did not believe it because they did not see the 
need of it. They held the wrong view of righteousness. The righteousness of 
which Paul speaks means rightness with God.</p> 
<p>There is no happiness finally, there is no peace, there is no joy except we 
be right with God.</p> 
<p>The miserable Christian is wrong in his ideas as to how this rightness with 
God is to be obtained.</p> 
<p>That was the trouble with the Jews also. They held that this rightness is 
attained by conforming to the Law as they understood it, and keeping it. But 
their whole view of the Law was entirely wrong. They perverted it, with the 
result that the very thing which God had given them to further His way of 
salvation had become in their hands the main obstacle to it.</p> 
<p>There are certain simple principles about which we must be quite clear 
before we can hope to enjoy this Christian salvation. The first is conviction 
of sin. We must be absolutely clear about our sinfulness.</p> 
<p>You must be made miserable before you can know true Christian joy. Indeed 
the real trouble with the miserable Christian is that he has never been truly 
made miserable because of conviction of sin. He has by-passed the essential 
preliminary to joy, he has been assuming something that he has no right to 
assume.</p> 
<p>The only thing which is going to drive a man to Christ and make him rely 
upon Christ alone, is a true conviction of sin.</p> 
<p>Their chief trouble often is their wrong idea of sin.</p> 
<p>That kind of person thinks of sin only in terms of action in terms of sins. 
Not only that, but in terms of certain particular actions only.</p> 
<p>So their tendency is to think that because they have not been guilty of 
these particular things, that they are not really sinners at all.</p> 
<p>Their thinking is in terms of actions, particular actions, and of 
comparisons with other people and their experiences, and so on. For this reason 
they have never plainly seen their utter absolute need of the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p> 
<p>They have heard it preached that Christ died for our sins and they say that 
they believe that; but they have never really known its absolute necessity for 
themselves.</p> 
<p>How then can such people be convicted of sin?</p> 
<p>Romans 3:10<br>
 10 as it is written:&rdquo;There is none righteous, no not 
one;</p> 
<p>Romans 3:23<br>
 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,
</p> 
<p>The reason why the Jews hated Christ and crucified Him, the whole 
explanation of &lsquo;the offense of the Cross&rsquo;, the reason why Paul was 
treated. As he was by his fellow countrymen who hated the Christian faith, was 
that the Christian faith that the Jews &ndash; the person who thought he had 
always lived a righteous and religious life &ndash; is as much a sinner as the 
most flagrant sinner amongst the Gentiles. &lsquo;All have sinned&rsquo;, Jews 
and Gentiles are equally condemned before God.</p> 
<p>The essential point is, that the way to know yourself a sinner..is to come 
faace to face with the Law of God.</p> 
<p>Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal..</p> 
<p>Mark 12:30,31<br>
 30 and you shall love the Lord your God with all your 
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your 
strength.&rdquo;This is the first commandment.<br>
 31 And the second is like 
this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment 
greater than these.</p> 
<p>Here is the test for you and me: Are you loving God with all your being? If 
you are not, you are a sinner.</p> 
<p>The second thing the true Christian realizes is God&rsquo;s way of 
salvation in Christ. This is the great news.</p> 
<p>Romans 3:22<br>
 22 even the righteousness of God through the faith of 
Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe.</p> 
<p>This righteousness of God in Jesus Christ. Salvation is all in Christ, and 
unless ou feel yourself shut up to Christ with everything else having failed, 
you are not a Christian, and it is not surprising that you are not happy.</p> 
<p>&lsquo;The righteousness of God in Jesus Christ&rsquo; means that God sent 
Him into the world in order that He might honor the Law and so men might be 
forgiven.</p> 
<p>Here is One, God in the flesh, who has taken human nature unto Himself and, 
as man, has rendered homage to God, perfect allegiance, perfect obedience. 
God&rsquo;s Law He kept fully and absolutely without failure.</p> 
<p>But not only that.</p> 
<p>Romans 3:25,26<br>
 25 whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through 
faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the 
sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;<br>
 26 for the 
display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving 
the one being of the faith of Jesus.</p> 
<p>26&nbsp;To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be 
just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p> 
<p>Which means this. Before man can be reconciled to God, before man can know
<br> God, this sin of his must be removed. God has said that He will punish 
sin, and that the punishment of sin is death and banishment from the face of 
God.</p> 
<p>This has to be dealt with. And what happened?</p> 
<p>God has set Him forth as a propitiation. That is the means which God has 
employed.</p> 
<p>His being the propitiation for our sins means that God has made Him 
responsible for our sins. They have been placed upon Him and God has dealt with 
them and punished them there, and therefore because He has punished our sins in 
Christ, in His body upon the Cross, He can justly forgive us. You see this is 
high doctrine.</p> 
<p>God, because He is righteous and holy and eternal, could not forgive the 
sin of man without punishing it. He said He would punish it, and so He must 
punish it, and, blessed be His Name, He has punished it. He is just, therefore, 
and the justifier of them that believe in Jesus. The sin has been punished, so 
God, Who is just and righteous, can forgive sin.</p> 
<p>God accepts this righteousness of Christ, this perfect righteousness face 
to face with the Law which He honored in every respect. He has kept it and 
given obedience to it, He has borne its penalty. The Law is fully satisfied.</p>
<p>God gives to us the righteousness of Christ. If we have seen our need and 
go to God and confess it, God will give us His own Son&rsquo;s righteousness. 
He imputes Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to us who believe in Him, and regards 
us as righteous, and declares and pronounces us to be righteous in Him. That is 
the way of salvation, the Christian way of salvation, the way of salvation 
through justification by faith.</p> 
<p>That I see and I believe and I look to nothing and to no one except to the 
Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>Romans 3:27&nbsp;Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of 
works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p> 
<p>They are still thinking in terms of themselves; their idea still is that 
they have to make themselves good enough to be a Christian, good enough to be 
accepted with Christ. They have to do it!</p> 
<p>But you will never be good enough; nobody has ever been good enough. The 
essence of the Christian salvation is to say that He is good enough and that I 
am in Him!</p> 
<p>As long as you go on thinking about yourself and saying: &lsquo;Ah, yes, I 
would like to, but I am not good enough; I am a sinner, a great sinner,&rsquo; 
you are denying God and you will never be happy.</p> 
<p>I try to say it from the pulpit every Sunday because I think it is the 
thing that is robbing most people of the joy of the Lord.</p> 
<p>It does not matter if you have almost entered into the depths of hell, if 
you are guilty of murder as well as every other vile sin, it does not matter 
from the standpoint of being justified with God. You are no more hopeless than 
the most respectable self-righteous person in the world.</p> 
<p>Do you believe from the standpoint of salvation and justification with God 
that all our customary distinction are abolished at a stroke and that what 
determines whether we are sinners or not is not what we have done, but our 
relationship to God?</p> 
<p>Look to Christ and to Christ alone and to nothing and no one else, that you 
stop looking at particular sins and particular people.</p> 
<p>Look at nothing and nobody but look entirely to Christ and say:</p> 
<p>&lsquo;My hope is built on nothing less<br>
 Than Jesus blood and 
righteousness,<br>
 I dare not trust my sweetest frame,<br>
 But wholly lean on 
Jesus Name.<br>
 On Christ the solid Rock I stand,<br>
 All other ground is 
sinking sand.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>You must so believe that as to be able to go further and say with holy 
boldness:</p> 
<p>&lsquo;The terrors of law and of God<br>
 With me can have nothing to do,
<br> My Savior&rsquo;s obedience and blood<br>
 Hide all my transgressions from 
view.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>What you need is not to make resolutions to live a better life, to start 
faa sting and sweating and praying. No! You just begin to say:</p> 
<p>&lsquo;I rest my faith on Him alone<br>
 Who died for my transgressions to 
atone.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Take that first step and you will find that immediately you will begin to 
experience a joy and a release that you have never known in your life before.

<p>Chapter 3 Men as Trees, Walking</p> 
<p>Mark 8:24<br>
 24 And he looked up and said, I see men as trees, walking.
</p> 
<p>If all Christians simply began to function as the New Testament would have 
us do, there would be no problem of evangelism confronting the Church. The 
matter would deal with itself immediately.</p> 
<p>The Protestant Reformation brought peace and happiness and joy into the 
life of the Church in a way she had not known since early centuries, and it all 
happened because the central doctrine of justification by faith was 
rediscovered. It made Martin Luther rejoice and sing and he in turn was the 
means of leading others to see this great truth.</p> 
<p>What then is the cure? It is to be honest and to answer our Lord&rsquo;s 
question truthfully and honestly. That is the whole secret of the matter.</p> 
<p>He turned to this man and asked: &lsquo;Do you see? And the man said, 
absolutely honest: &lsquo;I do see, but I am seeing men as if they were trees, 
walking.&rsquo; What saved this man was his absolute honesty.</p> 
<p>Where do we stand? What exactly do we see? Have we got things clearly? Are 
we happy? Do we really see? We either do or we do not..? Do we know God? Do we 
know Jesus Christ? Not only as our Savior but do we know Him? Are we 
&lsquo;rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory&rsquo;? That is New 
Testament.</p> 
<p>This man was healed and restored and &lsquo;saw every man clearly.&rsquo; 
The Christian position is a clear position.</p> 
<p>Do you believe that the Son of God came from heaven and lived and did all 
He did on earth, that He died on the Cross and was buried and rose again, that 
He ascended into heaven and sent the Holy Spirit, in order to leave us in a 
state of confusion? It is impossible.</p> 
<p>He came that we might see clearly, that we might know God. He came to give 
eternal life.</p> 
<p>John 17:3<br>
 3 And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the 
only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.</p> 
<p>No longer be an uncertain Christian seeing and not seeing. You will be able 
to say: &lsquo;I see, I see in Him all I need and more, and I know that I 
belong to Him.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>Chapter 4 Mind, Heart and Will</p> 
<p>Romans 6:17<br>
 17 But thanks be to our God that you were the slaves of 
sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were 
delivered.</p> 
<p>The kind of person who thinks that once you believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ all your problems are left behind and that the rest of the story will be 
&lsquo;they all lived happily ever after&rsquo; is certain sooner or later to 
suffer from this spiritual depression.</p> 
<p>We are brought into this marvelous life, this spiritual condition by the 
grace of God. But we must never forget that over and against us is another 
power. We are citizens of the Kingdom of God, but the Bible tells us that we 
are opposed by another kingdom..</p> 
<p>Ephesians 6:12<br>
 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but 
against principalities, against powers, against the world&rsquo;s rulers, of 
the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p> 
<p>The one thing Satan desires to do is to ruin and destroy the work of God; 
and there is no work of God which he is more anxious to destroy than the work 
of grace in and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>The moment we become Christian we become the special object of 
Satan&rsquo;s special attention.</p> 
<p>The moment we become Christian the devil is particularly concerned to get 
us down, and he has no more successful way of doing that than to make us 
miserable, or to make us suffer..</p> 
<p>Paul is concerned to emphasize the wholeness of the Christian life, the 
balance of the Christian life. It is a life in which one has 
&lsquo;obeyed&rsquo; &ndash; there is a will &ndash; &lsquo;from the 
heart&rsquo; &ndash; there is the emotion, the sensibility &ndash; &lsquo;the 
form of doctrine&rsquo; which came to the mind and to the understanding.</p> 
<p>The whole man is involved, the mind, the heart and the will, and a common 
cause of spiritual depression is the failure to realize that the Christian life 
is a whole life, a balance life.</p> 
<p>Romans 6:1<br>
 1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that 
grace may abound?</p> 
<p>There were people in the early Church that did argue like that, and there 
are still many who tend to do the same thing.</p> 
<p>Their attitude is: &lsquo;Very well, in the light of that doctrine 
(justification by faith) it does not matter what a man does, the more he sins 
the more God will be glorified in forgiving him. Being a Christian, it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do, I shall be covered by grace.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Paul&rsquo;s answer is, that you can only say aa thing like that if you do 
not understand the teaching. If you understood the teaching you would never 
draw deductions like that; it would be impossible.</p> 
<p>Romans 6:2<br>
 2 God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer 
live therein?</p> 
<p>Spiritual depression or unhappiness in the Christian life is very often due 
to our failure to realize the greatness of the gospel.</p> 
<p>Form of doctrine or standard of teaching.. People are often unhappy in the 
Christian life because they have thought of Christianity, and the whole message 
of the gospel, in inadequate terms.</p> 
<p>Some think that it is merely a message of forgiveness.</p> 
<p>There are others who conceive of it as morality only.. They want to do go 
in this world, and Christianity to them is an ethical, moral program. Such 
people are bound to be unhappy.</p> 
<p>There are still others who are interested in it simply as something good 
and beautiful. It makes aa great aesthetic appeal to them. Their way of 
describing the gospel and the entire message is..which makes them feel better 
when they hear it.</p> 
<p>These are incomplete and partial views over against what Paul here refers 
to as &lsquo;the form of doctrine&rsquo;, &lsquo;the standard of 
teaching&rsquo;, the great truth which he elaborates in this Epistle to the 
Romans.</p> 
<p>That is the gospel, all the &lsquo;infinities and immensities&rsquo; of 
this Epistle. Thomas Carlyle.</p> 
<p>We must have an accurate view of things.</p> 
<p>But someone may say: In the gospel message you just tell people about 
forgiveness of sins.&rsquo; In a sense that is right, but in another sense it 
is wrong.</p> 
<p>The gospel is not something partial or piecemeal: it takes in the whole 
life, the whole of history, the whole world. It tells us about creation and the 
final judgment and everything in between.</p> 
<p>The whole of life must come under its influence because it is 
all-inclusive; the gospel is meant to control and govern everything in our 
lives.</p> 
<p>We must realize the greatness of the gospel, its vast eternal span.</p> 
<p>The whole man must be involved in itt and by it.</p> 
<p>Romans 6:17<br>
 17 ye became obedient from the heart to that form of 
teaching whereunto ye were delivered;</p> 
<p>Man is a wonderful creature, he is mind, he is heart and he is will.</p> 
<p>There are some people in whose case the head only seems to be in use 
&ndash; the intellect, the understanding. They are tremendously interested in 
the gospel as a point of view, as a Christian philosophy. They believe and 
proclaim that if only this Christian point of view could be applied in 
politics, in industry and in every other circle all our troubles would be 
solved.</p> 
<p>There are others whose sole interest in the gospel is their interest in 
theology and doctrine, in great problems, arguments and discussions.</p> 
<p>Their minds were very much engaged; this was their intellectual hobby and 
interest. But the tragedy was that it stopped at that interest, and their 
hearts had never been touched.</p> 
<p>Not only was there an absence of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in 
their lives but there was often an absence of the ordinary milk of human 
kindness.</p> 
<p>Those who would argue and almost fight about particular doctrines, but they 
were often hard men to approach.</p> 
<p>The truth they were so interested in was not at all applied in their lives; 
it was something confined to their studies. It did not touch their conduct or 
behavior at all, but was confined entirely to the mind.</p> 
<p>There are others in whose case the gospel seems to affect the heart only. 
They feel that they have had an emotional release; they have passed through an 
emotional crisis. There is a real danger in having a purely emotional 
experience only.</p> 
<p>They may have committed some particular sin. They have tried to forget it 
but they cannot get away from it. At last they hear a message which seems to 
give them deliverance from that one thing, and they accept it, and all is well. 
But they stop at that.</p> 
<p>Certain people are in this position simply because they are moved 
aesthetically by the presentation of the gospel, by the atmosphere of the 
church, the painted windows, the monuments, the ritual, the hymns sung, the 
music, the sermon..</p> 
<p>One day they will have to face some crisis and to see things through. They 
have been content to live on their feelings.</p> 
<p>Others again are in this one-sided position because they have responded to 
an appeal in a meeting.</p> 
<p>You have the same thing in those whose will is alone involved. It is 
possible, and it has happened unfortunately, for people to be persuaded to take 
up Christianity. They say that they believe that it is a good life and they 
solemnly decide to take it up.</p> 
<p>I think we should abolish this word decision. I do not take it. It seems to 
me that to talk about deciding for Christ is a denial of the text that we are 
considering.</p> 
<p>Pressure has been put on the will. They have been told they must decide, 
and they do decide: but they do not always know why they do so. And later on 
they will begin to ask questions, the devil will see to it that questions are 
raised in their minds. And they will find that they do not have an answer.</p> 
<p>These are the people who decide to take up Christianity instead of being 
taken up by Christianity. They have not known this feeling of constraint, this 
feeling of, &lsquo;I can do no other, so help me, God&rsquo;, that they must, 
that everything else has to be excluded, that the truth has so come to them 
that they must accept it.</p> 
<p>Paul says, &lsquo;How can you say, Shall we continue to sin that grace may 
abound? It means that you do not know what grace is.&rsquo; It is only people 
who have understood the truth who desire it.</p> 
<p>You will find people who have one part of their personality engaged only 
&ndash; head only, heart only, will only. We will agree that they must be wrong.
</p> 
<p>It is equally wrong to have any two only.. Head and the heart only without 
the will, or the head and the will only without the heart..</p> 
<p>The Christian position is three-fold; it is the three together, and the 
three at the same time, and the three always.</p> 
<p>A great gospel like this takes up the whole man.</p> 
<p>It can satisfy man&rsquo;s mind completely, it can move his heart entirely, 
and it can lead wholehearted obedience in the realm of the will.</p> 
<p>There is a definite order about this verse.. These people were servants 
held by sin: they are no longer that. Why not? Paul says the form of doctrine 
came to them.</p> 
<p>What brought them out of slavery? The truth has been presented to them!</p> 
<p>They were not simply moved emotionally in the realm of the heart; it was 
not merely an appeal to the will. No, the Truth was presented.</p> 
<p>We must always put these things in the right order, and it is Truth first. 
It is doctrine first, it is the standard of teaching first, it is the message 
of the gospel first.</p> 
<p>We are not concerned simply to attract people emotionally or in the realm 
of the will, we are concerned to &lsquo;preach the Word&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>The Apostles were not sent out simply to produce results and to change 
people. They were sent &lsquo;to preach the gospel&rsquo;, to preach and 
declare &lsquo;Jesus and the resurrection&rsquo; &ndash; this message, this 
form of doctrine, the deposit!</p> 
<p>Those are the terms used in the NT aand the Church is certain to produce 
these spiritual monstrosities when she fails to put that first.</p> 
<p>The Christian should know why he is a Christian. He is able and ready 
&lsquo;to give a reason for the hope that is in him&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>The Christian knows why he is what he is, and where he stands. He has had 
doctrine presented to him, he has received the truth.</p> 
<p>It came to his mind, and it must ever start with his mind. Truth comes to 
the mind and to the understanding enlightened by the Holy Spirit. Then having 
seen the truth the Christian loves it. It moves his heart. He sees what he was, 
he sees the life he was living, and he hates it.. Then as you see the glorious 
truth about the love of Christ you will want it, you will desire it. So the 
heart is engaged. Truly to see the truth means that you are moved by it and 
that you love it. You cannot help it. If you see the truth clearly, you must 
feel it. Then that in turn leads to this, that your greatest desire will be to 
practise it and to live it.</p> 
<p>When we talk to others, the heart is never to be approached directly. The 
will is never to be approached directly either.</p> 
<p>The heart is always to be influenced through understanding &ndash; the 
mind, then the heart, then the will.</p> 
<p>Truth is received through God&rsquo;s greatest gift to man, the mind, the 
understanding.</p> 
<p>It starts there, but it goes on. It then moves the heart and finally the 
man yields his will. He obeys, not grudgingly or unwillingly, but with the 
whole heart.</p>

<p>Chapter 5 That One Sin</p> 
<p>1 Timothy 1:16<br>
 16 But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me 
first Jesus Christ might show forth all long- suffering, as a pattern to those 
being about to believe on Him to life everlasting.</p> 
<p>There is such a thing as false peace, there such a thing as believing 
delusions.</p> 
<p>The whole of the New Testament and the history of the Church throughout the 
centuries bear eloquent testimony to the fact that this is aa &lsquo;fight of 
faith&rsquo;, and not to have any troubles in your soul is, therefore, far from 
being a good sign.</p> 
<p>For from the moment we become Christians we become the special objects of 
the attention of the devil. As he besieged and attacked our Lord, so does he 
besiege and attack all the Lord&rsquo;s people.</p> 
<p>It is because we belong to Him that the devil will do his utmost to disturb 
and upset us.</p> 
<p>He cannot rob our salvation, thank God, but while he cannot rob our 
salvation he can make us miserable.</p> 
<p>He can, if we are foolish enough to listen to him seriously limit our 
enjoyment of our salvation.</p> 
<p>They come to you looking unhappy, indeed miserable, and they always talk 
about this one thing, they invariably bring it up. As a rule it is some action, 
some big thing. That is one thing to which they constantly hark back. They harp 
upon it and they cannot leave it. They are always analyzing it and scrutinizing 
and condemning themselves because of it. And the result is that they are 
unhappy.</p> 
<p>Sometimes it is something they have said, some word which they once spoke.
</p> 
<p>In other cases it may be the bondage of some promise or pledge, made but 
never kept, which causes the trouble.</p> 
<p>These are people who seem to be quite clear about the doctrine of 
salvation, except that they feel that in their case there is something &ndash; 
their sin, this particular sin .. which somehow puts them in a different 
category. They say, &lsquo;Yes, I know &ndash; but &hellip;&rsquo; They are 
held down, they are miserable Christians, they are suffering from this state of 
spiritual depression.</p> 
<p>What is the real trouble?</p> 
<p>First and foremost, of course, it is the work of the devil; it iss just 
Satan who, though he cannot rob uss of our salvation, can definitely rob us of 
our joy.</p> 
<p>There is also a subsidiary cause &hellip; this condition is almost entirely 
due to an ignorance of doctrine &ndash; a failure to understand the NT doctrine 
of salvation clearly and this is the very essence of the treatment of the 
condition.</p> 
<p>There is a sense in which the one thing that these people who are in this 
condition must not do is to pray to be delivered from it!</p> 
<p>This is one of those points at which the Christian must stop praying for a 
moment and begin to think!</p> 
<p>There are particular problems..if you do nothing but pray about them you 
will never solve them. You must stop praying at times because your prayer may 
just be reminding you of the problem and keeping your mind fixed upon it.</p> 
<p>So you must stop praying and think, and work out your doctrine.</p> 
<p>1 Timothy 1:12-16<br>
 12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who 
strengthened me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry 
&ndash;<br>
 13 the one who before was a blasphemer and a persecutor and 
insolent. But I obtained mercy, because being ignorant, I did it in unbelief.
<br> 14 And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love 
in Christ Jesus.<br>
 15 Faithful is the Word and worthy of all acceptance, 
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.<br>
 
16 But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might 
show forth all long- suffering, as a pattern to those being about to believe on 
Him to life everlasting.</p> 
<p>What Paul claims here is that in a sense the Lord Jesus Christ saved him in 
order to set him up as a model.</p> 
<p>A model for those people who feel that their particular sin somehow or 
another passes the limit of grace and the mercy of God.</p> 
<p>In a sense we must not differentiate between sin and sin.</p> 
<p>The nearer a man gets to God the greater he sees his sin.</p> 
<p>Finally there is only one sin and that is the sin of unbelief.</p> 
<p>We must not think on terms of particular sins but always in terms of our 
relationship to God.</p> 
<p>It takes the same grace of God to save the most respectable person in the 
world as the most lawless person in the world. Nothing but the grace of God can 
save anybody, and it takes the same grace to save all.</p> 
<p>Because we are wrong in our doctrine, we differentiate between sin and sin, 
and think some sins are worse than others. It all comes back to our 
relationship to God; it is all a matter oof belief or unbelief.</p> 
<p>Galatians 5:19-21<br>
 19 Now the works of the flesh are clearly revealed, 
which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lustfulness,<br>
 20 idolatry, 
sorcery, hatreds, fightings, jealousies, angers, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
<br> 21 envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revelings, and things like these; of 
which I tell you before, as I also said before, that they who do such things 
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p> 
<p>Yes, not only actual, but in the heart.</p> 
<p>Matthew 15:19<br>
 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, 
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies;</p> 
<p>Not only certain big sins but every sin, any sin, anything that suggests a 
wrong relationship to God &ndash; lawlessness, breaking the law.</p> 
<p>James 2:10<br>
 10 For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in 
one point, he is guilty of all.</p> 
<p>The trouble with this type of unhappy Christian is that he does not really 
believe the Scriptures.</p> 
<p>Your trouble is unbelief. You do not believe the Word of God. 1 John 1:9</p>
<p>There is no limit to it; there is no differentiation between sin and sin. 
Whatever your sin &ndash; it is as wide as that &ndash; it does not matter what 
it is, it does not matter what it was.</p> 
<p>You do not believe what He tells you and that is your real sin.</p> 
<p>The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin nd all 
unrighteousness.</p> 
<p>Do not go one praying frantically to be forgiven that sin.</p> 
<p>Do not ask Him for a message of forgiveness. He has given it to you. Your 
prayer may well be an expression of unbelief at that point. Believe Him and His 
Word.</p> 
<p>They do not seem to realize fully what our Lord did on the Cross on 
Calvary&rsquo;s Hill.</p> 
<p>They do believe in His sacrificial, toning death, but they do not work out 
its implications. They have not fully grasped the doctrine. They know enough to 
be saved &ndash; but they are in a state of depression because they do not 
realize fully what this means.</p> 
<p>Matthew 1:21<br>
 21 And she shall bear a son, and you shall call His name 
JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins.</p> 
<p>The angel did not say that He shall save from all sins except this one sin 
that you have committed.</p> 
<p>1 Peter 2:24<br>
 24 He Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, 
that dying to sins, we might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were 
healed.</p> 
<p>There is no qualification there, no limit.</p> 
<p>2 Corinthians 5:21<br>
 21 For He has made Him who knew no sin, to be sin 
for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</p> 
<p>John 19:30<br>
 30 Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It 
is finished! And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit.</p> 
<p>It is finished in the sense that not only all the sins committed in the 
past were dealt with there, but all the sins that could ever be committed were 
also dealt with there.</p> 
<p>It is one sacrifice, once and forever. He would never come back to the 
Cross again. All the sins were dealt with there finally and completely, 
everything. Nothing was left undone &ndash; &lsquo;It is finished.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>What we remind one another of as we take the bread and the wine, and what 
we proclaim, is that completed finished work. There is nothing left undone, 
there is no qualification concerning particular sins.</p> 
<p>All the sins of those who believe on Him, every one, have been dealt with 
and God has blotted them out as a thick cloud. All the sins you may ever commit 
have been dealt with there, so when you go to Him it is &lsquo;the Blood of 
Jesus Christ His Son&rsquo; that is going to cleanse you.</p> 
<p>We must be clear about justification. Our justification means not only that 
our sins are forgiven and that we have been declared to be righteous by God 
Himself, not merely that we were righteous at that moment when we believed, but 
permanently righteous.</p> 
<p>For justification means this also, that we are given by God the positive 
righteousness of His own Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>It does not only mean that your sins are forgiven. It means that He clothes 
us also with the righteousness of Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>He says in effect: &lsquo;You are righteous; I see, not a sinner, but a 
righteous child of My own; I see you in Christ covered by His holiness and 
righteousness&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>And when God does that to us, He does it once and for ever.</p> 
<p>God sees your sins no more; He sees the righteousness of Christ upon you. 
Lay hold of that.</p> 
<p>Essentially salvation means union with Christ, being one with Christ.</p> 
<p>As we were one with Adam we are now one with Christ. We have been crucified 
with Christ. Gal 2:20. &lsquo;I am crucified with Christ&rsquo;, Paul says. 
&lsquo;All that has happened to Him has happened to me. I am one with 
Him&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>We have died with Christ, have been buried with Christ, have risen with 
Christ, are seated in the heavenly places in Christ and with Christ.</p> 
<p>Romans 6:6,11<br>
 6 knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him 
in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should 
not serve sin.<br>
 11 Likewise count yourselves also to be truly dead to sin, 
but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> 
<p>If you look at your past and are depressed, it means that you are listening 
to the devil.</p> Comment <br>

<h2>Oct 31, 1517: Martin Luther posts 95&nbsp;theses</h2>  Filed under: 
Uncategorized &mdash; Leave a comment <br>
October 31, 2011 <br>

<p>On this day in 1517, the priest and scholar Martin Luther approaches the 
door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, and nails a piece of paper to 
it containing the 95 revolutionary opinions that would begin the Protestant 
Reformation.</p> 
<p>In his theses, Luther condemned the excesses and corruption of the Roman 
Catholic Church, especially the papal practice of asking payment&mdash;called 
&ldquo;indulgences&rdquo;&mdash;for the forgiveness of sins. At the time, a 
Dominican priest named Johann Tetzel, commissioned by the Archbishop of Mainz 
and Pope Leo X, was in the midst of a major fundraising campaign in Germany to 
finance the renovation of St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in Rome. Though Prince 
Frederick III the Wise had banned the sale of indulgences in Wittenberg, many 
church members traveled to purchase them. When they returned, they showed the 
pardons they had bought to Luther, claiming they no longer had to repent for 
their sins.</p> 
<p>Luther&rsquo;s frustration with this practice led him to write the 95 
Theses, which were quickly snapped up, translated from Latin into German and 
distributed widely. A copy made its way to Rome, and efforts began to convince 
Luther to change his tune. He refused to keep silent, however, and in 1521 Pope 
Leo X formally excommunicated Luther from the Catholic Church. That same year, 
Luther again refused to recant his writings before the Holy Roman Emperor 
Charles V of Germany, who issued the famous Edict of Worms declaring Luther an 
outlaw and a heretic and giving permission for anyone to kill him without 
consequence. Protected by Prince Frederick, Luther began working on a German 
translation of the Bible, a task that took 10 years to complete.</p> 
<p>The term &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; first appeared in 1529, when Charles V 
revoked a provision that allowed the ruler of each German state to choose 
whether they would enforce the Edict of Worms. A number of princes and other 
supporters of Luther issued a protest, declaring that their allegiance to God 
trumped their allegiance to the emperor. They became known to their opponents 
as Protestants; gradually this name came to apply to all who believed the 
Church should be reformed, even those outside Germany. By the time Luther died, 
of natural causes, in 1546, his revolutionary beliefs had formed the basis for 
the Protestant Reformation, which would over the next three centuries 
revolutionize Western civilization.</p>

<p>Happy Reformation Day?!<br>
 Published on October 30, 2011<br>
 With all 
the effort the church has put into making Halloween more 
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; (Hallelujah Harvests, Fall Festivals, etc), why 
haven&rsquo;t we ever seen fit to simply celebrate what truly is one of the 
most important dates in the history of the church? October 31, 1517, is the 
date given to officially commemorate the start of the Protestant Reformation; 
its&nbsp;the day Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle 
Church in Wittenburg, Germany. Reformation Day.</p> 
<p>That day Martin Luther fulfilled Jon Hus&rsquo;s prophecy from a hundred 
years earlier. In 1415, on the night before he was burned at the stake for 
preaching against the Catholic Church&rsquo;s abuses, Hus wrote, &ldquo;Today, 
you are burning a goose [&quot;Hus&quot; means &quot;goose&quot; in Czech]; 
however, a hundred years from now, you will be able to hear a swan sing, you 
will not burn it, you will have to listen to him.&rdquo; And listen to him they 
did. They still listen. If you travel all over Germany even today, there are 
swan statues that symbolize Martin Luther and his influence.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Luther&rsquo;s day, the only hope for reduced time in Purgatory for 
members of the Church came in the form of Indulgences; these merits were based 
on the sinless life and perfect works of Jesus and Mary, His mother. According 
to the Catholic Church, their merits were &ldquo;stored up&rdquo; in heaven, 
where they could be dispersed by the Pope &ndash; for a price. &nbsp;And many 
of Luther&rsquo;s theses were aimed directly at the sale of Indulgences. 
Consider his words in thesis 27, &ldquo;There is no divine authority for 
preaching that the soul flies out of the purgatory immediately the money clinks 
in the bottom of the chest.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Luther had spent months preaching against the sale of Indulgences, and 
compiling his theses. So on the evening before Nov. 1 (All Saints Day), he 
posted his 95&nbsp;Theses where they would be read and discussed by other 
Augustinian monks &ndash; on the door of the church. On All Saints Day, the 
Indulgence business would be booming as people came from all over to pay to see 
relics (items the Catholic Church collected and charged people to see) such as 
a veil sprinkled with the blood of Christ, a twig of Moses&rsquo; burning bush, 
or a piece of bread from the last supper.</p> 
<p>As news of Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;attack&rdquo; spread, a new era in the 
church&rsquo;s history dawned. The Word began to be translated into common 
languages. There was a return to Scripture as the Authority &ndash; not the 
Pope. &ldquo;Sola Scriptura&rdquo; (Scripture Alone) became the battlecry of 
The Reformation. These &ldquo;protesters&rdquo; and their movement, 
Protestantism, gained steam and began refocusing the good news about Jesus on 
grace and faith and God&rsquo;s sovereign plan for the ages. Martin Luther 
taught that Christ is our righteousness. That we are justified by grace alone, 
through faith alone &ndash; not through the Catholic Church and her 
Indulgences.&nbsp;And Luther&rsquo;s motivation, I believe, is summed up in 
thesis 62, &ldquo;The true treasure of the church is the Holy gospel of the 
glory and the grace of God.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>October 31 is indeed a day to celebrate! But it has nothing to do with 
pagan rituals or pumpkins or costumes. On this day just under 500 years ago, 
one man took a stand against the entire Catholic Church because he believed the 
authority and truth of the Bible. And it ignited a movement that we are proud 
to be part of still today. So what are you celebrating this October 31?</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t let Reformation Day go by unnoticed. As you celebrate today, 
use this date as a teaching moment in your family. Take a moment to thank God 
for His saints and their convictions. And finally, thank God for their boldness 
and ask Him to give us that same spirit of unrest when we see abuse. Soli Deo 
Gloria! (To God Be The Glory)</p>

<h2>R.C. Sproul on Luther and the&nbsp;Reformation</h2>  Filed under: 
Uncategorized &mdash; Leave a comment <br>
October 31, 2011 <br>

<p>On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther tacked up 95 theses on the church door 
at Wittenberg. With this act, he hoped to provoke a discussion among the 
scholars about the abuses of the indulgences by the Roman Catholic Church. He 
was not trying to create a public furor by any means, but within a fortnight, 
these theses had spread through the country like wildfire.&nbsp;The last thing 
Luther had in mind was to start some kind of major controversy, but 
nevertheless major controversy did&nbsp;begin.</p> 
<p>From the discussions at Wittenberg, the disputations began to accelerate 
and escalate. Copies of the theses reached Rome and critical meetings were 
scheduled with the young monk. In these debates,&nbsp;Luther was 
maneuvered&nbsp;into proclaiming publicly that he had questions about the 
infallibility of church councils&nbsp;and also&nbsp;that he thought that it was 
possible that the pope could err. In 1520 a papal encyclical was issued which 
condemned Martin Luther as a heretic.&nbsp;Luther burned the document in a 
public bonfire and his defiance before the church was now a matter 
of&nbsp;record.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In response, Martin Luther picked up his pen to challenge the entire 
penitential system of the Roman Catholic Church, which undermined in principle 
the free remission of sins that is ours in the gospel. By doing so, he was 
unswervingly advocating his commitment to sola fide, the doctrine of 
justification by faith&nbsp;alone.</p> 
<p>In 1521, Luther was summoned to the Imperial Diet, an authoritative meeting 
that involved the princes of the church, called by the Emperor of the Holy 
Roman Empire to be held in the city of Worms in Germany. Luther was an outlaw. 
For him to appear at the Diet was to risk his very life; therefore, he was 
given safe conduct&nbsp;by the Emperor&nbsp;to attend.&nbsp;With a few friends, 
Luther traveled from Wittenberg to Worms. The eyewitnesses of that episode tell 
us that when Luther&rsquo;s little covered wagon appeared around the corner of 
the bend, there were lookouts posted in the church tower at Worms. All the 
people were agog waiting for the arrival of this notorious person. When 
Luther&rsquo;s caravan was sighted, people were throwing their hats in the air, 
blowing trumpets, and creating all the fanfare of the arrival of the hero. It 
was the 16th century answer to a ticker-tape&nbsp;parade.</p> 
<p>Things, however, became very solemn in a hurry because the next day he 
appeared before the Diet. His books were stacked on a table in the room, and he 
was asked and ordered to recant of his writings. This surprised Luther because 
he thought he was going to have an opportunity to defend his writings; but the 
only question really of any importance that was asked of him was this: 
&ldquo;Are these your writings?&rdquo; And when he said yes, they said, 
&ldquo;Are you ready to recant of&nbsp;them?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hollywood has their version of Luther standing there boldly with his fist 
in the air saying, &ldquo;Here I stand!&rdquo; and so on. But instead he 
dropped his chin on his chest and muttered something that nobody could 
understand, so they asked him to speak up. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; He 
said, &ldquo;May I have 24 hours to think about it.&rdquo; And so Luther was 
granted a reprieve of 24 hours to return to his room to contemplate the 
seriousness of this&nbsp;occasion.</p> 
<p>The prayer that Luther wrote in that ensuing 24-hour period was one of the 
most moving prayers I have ever read in my life. In that prayer, Luther cried 
out for God in his sense of total loneliness fearing that God had abandoned 
him, and proclaimed, &ldquo;O Lord, I am Thine, and the cause is Thine, give me 
the courage to&nbsp;stand.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And on the morrow, Luther was called once again back to the court and was 
told to reply to the question. He said to the Diet, &ldquo;Unless I am 
convinced by sacred scripture or by evident reason, I cannot recant, for my 
conscience is held captive by the Word of God, and to act against conscience is 
neither right nor safe. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me.&rdquo; 
And with that there was an instant&nbsp;uproar.</p> 
<p>The Emperor himself later indicated his regret that he even gave Luther a 
safe conduct, and immediately put a new price on his head. As Luther was 
leaving the city, his friends staged a kidnapping to protect him and took him 
away in a fast horse through the forest. They hid him for a year in Wartburg at 
the castle disguised as a knight. During that year, Luther undertook the task 
of translating the Bible from the biblical languages into German. And that 
perhaps was his most important legacy of that time &ndash; that he made the 
Bible available to the common people. And with that the Reformation 
was&nbsp;born.</p>

<h2>Quotes from Why I am a Lutheran by Daniel&nbsp;Preus</h2>  Filed under: 
Lutheran &mdash; Leave a comment <br>
September 6, 2011 <br>

<p>It is my hope, within the pages of one modest volume, to demonstrate what 
is always and only at the center of all Christian teaching &ndash; Jesus Christ 
and Him crucified.</p> 
<p>Apart from the birth, life, suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus, 
Christianity is neither unique nor particularly helpful to sinners living under 
the Law of a righteous and powerful God.</p> 
<p>But in Him, in His person and work, God is revealed to us in a way that 
truly is unique among all world religions. Through Jesus we come to see God as 
gracious. He loves us; He saves us; He forgives us; He helps us constantly; He 
adopts us as His children and bequeaths to us an everlasting kingdom &ndash; 
all for the sake of Jesus.</p> 
<p>To express this life-changing message, I have attempted, as much as is 
possible, to limit myself to demonstrating one simple, yet profound truth: 
Jesus is at the center of all that is truly Christian.</p> 
<p>John 1:14<br>
 14 And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us. And 
we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of 
grace and of truth.</p> 
<p>Revelation 1:8<br>
 8 I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the 
Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.</p> 
<p>Isaiah 41:4<br>
 4 Who has planned and done it, calling forth the 
generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, am the first and the last; I am He.
</p> 
<p>Jesus is the eternal one who always has been and always will be. With these 
words, Jesus proclaims that the entire revelation of God given to us in the 
Holy Scriptures was given so we might know Him.</p> 
<p>Jesus uses the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet (alpha and 
omega) to describe Himself. Thus Jesus announces that from Genesis to 
Revelation, from the first letter of the Scripture to the last, God&rsquo;s 
Word witnesses to Him.</p> 
<p>John 5:39<br>
 39 You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have 
eternal life. And they are the ones witnessing of Me,</p> 
<p>Jesus meant more than that the Old Testament contains one or two passages 
that refer to Him. Rather, Jesus was stating that the Old Testament is all 
about Him.</p> 
<p>..we are tempted by any number of media preachers to view the Christian 
faith as a set of rules to shape good behavior that pleases God. And if 
Christianity is defined as something little different than other world 
religions, it is not surprising that people forsake it in vast numbers..</p> 
<p>In one semse, a major theme of the Bible and of Christianity is our conduct 
as human beings. But this does not mean that we are able to please God with our 
behavior. On the contrary, everything we learn in the Bible about our behavior 
reveals that we never will and never can measure up to the requirements of 
God&rsquo;s Law.</p> 
<p>Romans 3:23<br>
 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, 
</p> 
<p>Psalms 53:2,3<br>
 2 God looked down from Heaven on the sons of mankind to 
see if any was discerning, who was seeking God. Psalms<br>
 3 Every one has 
turned away; they have altogether become filthy; not one is doing good, no, not 
even one.</p> 
<p>In response to this tragic message of our inability to please Him, God 
reveals to us His love in the person of His Son. This message is the beating 
heart of Christianity. All the teachings of the Bible revolve around Jesus, its 
pulsating center, the Savior of the world.</p> 
<p>Because all of us are sinful and break God&rsquo;s commands each day, we 
deserve nothing but God&rsquo;s punishment for what we think, say, and do. But 
Christianity teaches that God loved the people of this world so much that He 
did not wish to punish us for our sinful thoughts, words, and acts.</p> 
<p>Instead, God the Father sent His Son to do what sinful people could not do. 
God the Son became a human being, was born of the Virgin Mary, and lived His 
entire life on earth so He could save sinful people and restore them to their 
heavenly Father.</p> 
<p>As our substitute, Jesus kept the Law perfectly for us, yet He was punished 
for the sins of the world, taking all our guilt on Himself and dying the death 
we deserved for the wrongs we had done.</p> 
<p>Because of Jesus&rsquo; life, death, and resurrection, God forgives us and 
promises the gift of eternal life in heaven to everyone who believes in His Son.
</p> 
<p>Centuries ago, Johann Gerhard, a Lutheran pastor and theologian, wrote that 
every word of the Bible is to be read as if it were printed with ink that is 
the very blood of Jesus. God caused every single word of the Scriptures to be 
written with this objective in mind: to show us His Son, our Savior. By showing 
us Jesus, God brings us to faith in Him, and with faith comes life.</p> 
<p>People need to be loved .. The finest love comes from Jesus and His 
sacrifices for us on the cross. His mission on earth was for us as He died for 
the sins of the entire world, including your sins and mine. Jesus paid for 
every last sin when He hung on the cross.</p> 
<p>The mission of the church is to proclaim this beautiful message throughout 
the world. The message begins with the Word and Sacraments in our 
congregations. Then the message of Jesus&rsquo; love and what He has done for 
us moves into our family life..and whatever other vocation God has given to us. 
Ultimately, Jesus&rsquo; love and the beautiful message of the Savior go out 
into the community, into the world, through our pastor and the family of God.
</p> 
<p>God does not give us truth simply so we can be correct in what we believe. 
God does not give us truth so we can know that we are right and those who 
disagree with us are wrong. God does not give us truth so we can &ldquo;win the 
argument.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Jesus, the Son of God, did not take on human flesh, did not become one of 
us, simply so we can know what is true. John tells us in his Gospel that when 
Jesus came into the world, He was full of truth and grace (John 1:14). Jesus 
brings truth for the sake of grace, that is, for the sake of God&rsquo;s 
undeserved kindness.</p> 
<p>Knowing Jesus is the Son of God is essential. But unless we know and 
believe that Jesus is the Son of God who has come to forgive, all is nothing. 
It is essential that we know and believe that Jesus died on the cross, but His 
death will not help us one whit unless we know that Jesus died on a cross for 
our sins, that His death earned our forgiveness so we can live forever with Him 
and all who are His. It is essential that we know Jesus rose from the dead, but 
it is more important that we know He rose from the dead for us so we, too, will 
rise one day to inherit an eternal kingdom.</p> 
<p>Truth without grace won&rsquo;t help us. Moses brought truth. Moses brought 
the Law, and every word of it was true. But it only showed people their sins, 
their weaknesses, their failings, their lack of love for the God who gave that 
Law.</p> 
<p>God&rsquo;s Law strips us bare.. God&rsquo;s Law, when it&rsquo;s taken 
seriously, shames and embarrasses us; it makes us turn away in fear. It shows 
us for what we are &ndash; sinners.</p> 
<p>But truth does not necessarily help us. We need truth Jesus brings. The 
true grace Jesus brings covers every sin.</p> 
<p>John 1:29<br>
 29 The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, 
Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</p> 
<p>This message of truth with grace, this message of Jesus the Savior, lies at 
the center of Scripture, at the very heart of the Christian faith.</p> 
<p>All of Scripture and the entire Christian faith are brought into focus only 
when it is all about Jesus &ndash; Jesus the incarnate Son of God, who came to 
bring grace that gives life to all who believe in Him.</p> 
<p>&mdash;</p> 
<p>Jesus came to make us right with God, which means He came to justify us 
before God.</p> 
<p>This word (justify) wonderfully describes the reason the Son of God became 
a man. The Greek word we translate as &ldquo;justify&rdquo; means &ldquo;to put 
into right relationship (with God), to acquit, to declare and treat as 
righteous, to show or prove to be right.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>To say that Jesus came to justify us is to say that the goal of His life 
and work was that we might stand before God as righteous, acquitted of all sin 
and guilt. To stand justified before God means that He looks on us as innocent, 
as pure in His eyes. But we are sinful. We have broken God&rsquo;s 
commandments. We are guilty. How can God acquit us? How can a just God justify 
guilty people? How can a good God declare bad people to be good?</p> 
<p>God looks at us and, on the basis of what He sees, declares us to be just 
or unjust. If God declares us unjust, then, of course, He is unhappy with or 
angry at what He sees. If God declares us just, then that means He is happy 
with what He sees.</p> 
<p>If God is angry with us, we are afraid because He is the all-powerful God 
who created all things. At His word everything came into being, and if one who 
is so powerful becomes angry, surely the results will be terrible.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if God is pleased with me, I am going to be happy. As 
Paul writes: &ldquo;If God is for us, who can be against us?&rdquo; (Rom 8:31).
</p> 
<p>This God is not only the God who judges and punishes sin but also the God 
who has prepared an eternal kingdom of glory and joy for all those on whom His 
favor rests.</p> 
<p>Is God angry with you and me? He is if He sees sinful people, lawbreakers, 
commandment violaters.</p> 
<p>Is God happy, pleased, and delighted with you and me? He is if He sees 
just, righteous, innocent, holy people.</p> 
<p>What does God sees when He looks at us? To answer this crucial question, we 
can look at three biblical mountains: Mount Sinai, Mount Calvary, and Mount 
Zion.</p> 
<p>All three mountains help answer the question of what God sees when He looks 
at you and me. All three mountains explain why Jesus is at the center of 
Scripture and the Christian faith.</p> 
<p>Mount Sinai</p> 
<p>On Mount Sinai, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments. The writer to the 
Hebrews tells us that whoever comes to this mountain cannot touch it because it 
is ..</p> 
<p>Heb 12:18-21</p> 
<p>The writer to Hebrews does not exaggerate about this mountain and the 
penalties incurred by those who touch it.</p> 
<p>Exodus 19:12<br>
 12 And you shall set bounds to the people round about, 
saying, Take heed to yourselves. Do not go up into the mountain, or touch the 
border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.</p> 
<p>Exodus 20:18-19 they said to Moses, &ldquo;You speak to us, and we will 
listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is what happenss when sinful people are confronted by God&rsquo;s holy 
Law. This is what happens when God&rsquo;s commandments peel away the thin, 
flase veneer of human righteousness to reveal the guilt and shame that lie 
beneath.</p> 
<p>It is as if a storm takes place within the himan soul and we see what we 
are, what we have done, our failures, our faults, our sins &ndash; and we are 
afraid.</p> 
<p>Before Adam and Eve sinned, God&rsquo;s Law caused them no fear. They had 
been created in God&rsquo;s image, holy and pure. But after Adam and Eve 
disobeyed God, they were afraid (Gen 3:10; 2:17).</p> 
<p>To exorcise this fear, our postmodern society has done everything possible 
to dilute God&rsquo;s Law. Society does its best tto abbreviate, adumbrate, and 
eliminate God&rsquo;s Law.</p> 
<p>We live in an age in which people no longer wish to believe in laws that 
bind them because if they did, they would be guilty and afraid when they broke 
those laws.</p> 
<p>Thus almost every sin that God forbids &ndash; is justified today by those 
who wish to commit it.</p> 
<p>Society has done all it can to eliminate God&rsquo;s Law and thereby 
extinguish God&rsquo;s anger. If God&rsquo;s anger has been extinguished, then 
all penalty for sin, all punishment, also is eradicated. Thus the message of 
Sinai is silenced. The thinder can no longer be heard. The lightning cannot be 
seen. The quaking cannot be felt. The smoke cannot be smelled nor does it 
irritate the eyes.</p> 
<p>Because we do not wish to be afraid, we have abolished everything that 
could frighten us.</p> 
<p>We have become the center and purpose of our lives, and we believe that we 
justify ourselves.</p> 
<p>In the face of such rebellion aand defiance, Jesus says: </p> 
<p>Matthew 5:18<br>
 18 For truly I say to you, Till the heaven and the earth 
pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall in any way pass from the law until 
all is fulfilled.</p> 
<p>1Cor 6:9-10; Eph 5:3-6; Gal 5:18-21</p> 
<p>The Law God gave on Mount Sinai still stands. We may stop our ears so we 
cannot hear it, but the thunder still rumbles. We may close our eyes, put on a 
blindfold, or even put out our eyes, but the lightning still flashes.</p> 
<p>Exodus 19:12 whoever touches this mountain shall be put to death.</p> 
<p>All of us have touched this mountain.</p> 
<p>Gen 6:5 his heart was only evil continually</p> 
<p>1Kings 8:46 there is no one who does not sin.</p> 
<p>Romans 3:23 all have sinned</p> 
<p>Psalm 51:5 we are sinful from birth. We call this teaching original sin.</p>
<p>From the time of Adam and Eve, all people have been born sinful and are in 
rebellion against God unless brought to faith by the power of the Holy Spirit 
through the Gospel.</p> 
<p>Standing on Sinai, we will never appear before our God as holy, pure, and 
just. We have laid our hands on God&rsquo;s Law and we have broken it. We touch 
Sinai every day. There is no justification for the sinner on this mountain. 
There is only lightning and thunder, God&rsquo;s anger and death.</p> 
<p>But there is one who can stand on this mountain. That person is .. Jesus 
Christ. Jesus is the new Adam who can touch Mount Sinai and not burn or die. He 
is the one who fulfilled God&rsquo;s holy Law for us.</p> 
<p>However, the guilt and the death that result from our sin must be 
addressed, which our Lord provides for too.</p> 
<p>Mount Calvary</p> 
<p>Despite what we are, despite what we have done, God loves us. Our heavenly 
Father knows we can&rsquo;t meet Him on Sinai, so He sent Jesus, His Son, there 
for us. Now God points us to another mountain, a mountain on which we can meet 
Him and live.</p> 
<p>Isaiah 25:8<br>
 8 (on this mountain) He will swallow up death in victory; 
and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He shall take 
away from all the earth the rebuke of His people. For the LORD has spoken.</p> 
<p>Upon Mount Calvary, we can meet our God without fear because the Son of God 
gave up His life on this mountain to wash awaay all our sins, guilt, and shame. 
With sin, guilt, and shame gone, we now can stand before God, righteous and 
pure.</p> 
<p>He is not angry when He looks at us because He sees holy and sinless sons 
and daughters. God looks at us and declares us to be just because of what Jesus 
has done. This is the meaning of Mount Calvary.</p> 
<p>But how can we be justified and declared innocent because of what Jessus 
has done? To answer this question, we must explore a central, indeed 
fundamental, Christian concept.. It&rsquo;s the concept of substitution.</p> 
<p>In simple terms, a substitute takes the place of another. Everything the 
substitute does has the same value as if the original person does. (Consider 
the basketball game).</p> 
<p>God gave us rules by which we were supposed to live, but we broke those 
rules. We fouled out the game of life, so to speak, right at the start..</p> 
<p>We were headed for a certain loss. Then God sent in a substitute. He sent 
His own Son to take our place and do what we were unable to do. We should have 
kept the Law, but we didn&rsquo;t. Instead, our substitute kept God&rsquo;s Law 
for us.</p> 
<p>John 17:4; Heb 4:15; John 15:10</p> 
<p>We were supposed to be punished for our sins, for breaking God&rsquo;s 
rules and commandments, but God sent a substitute for that too. Jesus was 
punished in our place, bearing our sin and guilt so we could go free.</p> 
<p>John 1:29; Isaiah 53:4-6</p> 
<p>But Jesus did more than take our punishment and death. He was our 
substitute in every way on every day of His life. Everything we should have 
been, our substitute was. Everything we should have done, our substitute did. 
Everything we should have suffered, our substitute suffered.</p> 
<p>Because Jesus kept every commandment perfectly, our God looks at us as if 
we had kept every commandment perfectly. Jesus took care of Mount Sinai for us, 
and He took care of us on Mount Calvary when He died on the cross for our sins.
</p> 
<p>Therefore, God looks at us as if we already had died on the cross and paid 
for our sins. After all, our substitute did it for us.</p> 
<p>Galatians 3:13<br>
 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being 
made a curse for us( for it is written,&rdquo;Cursed is everyone having been 
hanged on a tree&rdquo;);</p> 
<p>Not only has Christ taken on Himself all our sins and made them His own, 
but He has given to us His righteousness and made then ours. Luther called this 
the &ldquo;blessed exchange&rdquo; that occurs between Christ and the sinner. 
Because of this blessed exchange, Christ has taken our place and we take our 
place before God in Christ. In other words, the Father looks on His Son as if 
He were all sinners and the Father looks on us sinners as if we were His Son.
</p> 
<p>Clearly the righteousness of the Christian, the righteousness by which we 
stand justified before God, is not our own righteousness &ndash; it&rsquo;s an 
alien righteousness, a righteousness that comes not from within us but from 
outside of us. It is the righteousness of Jesus.</p> 
<p>Mount Sinai or Mount Calvary &ndash; where will we look for hope? If we 
look tp our own goodness and works for justification before God, we go to Sinai 
without Jesus. There is no hope for us there. Sinai will only kill us. Rom 
3:19-20</p> 
<p>But we do have hope. Rom 3:21-24</p> 
<p>As sinful, human beings, we don&rsquo;t want to be sent to Sinai to touch 
it on our own. We don&rsquo;t want to trust our own lives or works for comfort. 
We don&rsquo;t want to look inside ourselves for God&rsquo;s favor.</p> 
<p>Rom 7:18</p> 
<p>Instead, our comfort, assurance, and hope come from Jesus, who alone atones 
for sin and whose righteousness has merit before God.</p> 
<p>We see the glory of Mount Calvary as we look to Jesus, who alone is holy 
and just, who alone redeems, saves, and justifies. He has done everything 
necessary for our salvation. Apart from Jesus there is no hope, no forgiveness, 
no eternal life. Not only is He at the center of God&rsquo;s plan of salvation 
&ndash; Jesus is the plan.</p> 
<p>Mount Zion</p> 
<p>Heb 12:18; 22-24</p> 
<p>When you and I became Christians, we came to Mount Zion, that is, we became 
members of the church, which is the family of God. This church is one 
throughout the whole world, and it is one in heaven. There are not two Zions, 
but one. There are not two churches, there is one.</p> 
<p>As members of the church, we enter an awesome family fellowship with 
thousand of angels, with archangels, and with all those family members now 
living in the heavenly Jerusalem who are one with earthly Jerusalem.</p> 
<p>This fellowship is with God the Father who cares and loves His family..</p> 
<p>This fellowship is the eternal feast of everlasting righteousness, which is 
given to the family of God by the Lamb who was slain. And the Lamb now feeds 
the Father&rsquo;s family with Word and Sacraments.</p> 
<p>All this we accept, know, and confess through faith in Christ. But how do 
we get this faith in Jesus?</p> 
<p>First, Jesus has done absolutely everything necessary for our salvation. 
When Jesus cried out from the cross that it was finished (John 19:30), He was 
declaring that nothing more needed to be done to redeem people from sin, death, 
and hell. God&rsquo;s love for the world sent Jesus to suffer qnd die for 
everyone.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, unless we believe what the Scriptures tell us about Jesus, 
His life and work will be of no benefit to us.</p> 
<p>Mark 16:16<br>
 16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he 
who does not believe will be condemned.</p> 
<p>John 3:3; 2 Cor 5:19</p> 
<p>Those who do not believe this message of grace receive none of its 
blessings.</p> 
<p>It is through faith alone that we receive this righteousness of Christ so 
God looks on us as righteous and just.</p> 
<p>Hab 2:4; Rom 1:17; Eph 2:8; 1 John 5: 11-12</p> 
<p>Luther said in the Third Article:</p> 
<p>I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus 
Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Spirit has called me by the 
Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true 
faith..</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit calls us to faith by means of the Gospel. The Gospel is the 
Good News about Jesus our Savior and all He has done to bring us into a right 
relationship with God. It is the Good News about how Jesus took care of Mount 
Sinai and Mount Calvary for us. It is the Good News about Jesus our substitute 
who bore the punishment for our sins, our substitute who conquered death 
through His death, our substitute who rose from the dead so we, too, will rise 
to live with God forever.</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit uses the message of the Gospel to bring us to faith, and 
this is the only way people are brought to faith, the only way the church is 
created.</p> 
<p>God gives no one his Spirit or grace except through or with the external 
Word. The Word of God gives birth to the church, nourishes the church, 
strengthens the church, preserves the church, and sustains the church to the 
end. The Word of God alone causes the church to grow.</p> 
<p>Isaiah 55: 10-11</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit gives birth to the church and grows the church through the 
Word, through the proclamation of the Gospel. The Law does not create, sustain, 
or strengthened faith; it will only kill.</p> 
<p>Only the message about Jesus our Savior, our substitute through whom we 
have forgiveness and eternal life, creates and sustains faith.</p> 
<p>The proclamation of the Law confronts sinners with their sin. Then the 
Gospel gives life to sinners who were &ldquo;dead in the trespasses and 
sins&rdquo; (Eph 2:1).</p> 
<p>By showing sinners the Savior who loved the world and gave Himself for it, 
the Gospel raises sinners from spiritual death to spiritual life.</p> 
<p>God takes us to Mount Sinai so we can see our sin. God takes us to Mount 
Calvary to witness the consequence of sin, the wrath of God, which brings 
death. But the message of the Gospel is that Jesus took care of the required 
holiness of Mount Sinai and took care of God&rsquo;s wrath against sin by 
taking on Himself the punishment of death on Mount Calvary. God brings us and 
all Christians to Mount Zion only through the Gospel.</p> 
<p>In the fourth century, the church had to fight against the teachings of 
Pelagius, who believed that humans entered the world morally indifferent and 
could develop a moral germ or spark that led to salvation.</p> 
<p>In the sixteenth century, the church had to defend the truth of God&rsquo;s 
Word against Arminius, who taught that human beings cooperate in their 
conversion.</p> 
<p>The teachings of these two men denied original sin and were condemned by 
the church, but now they appear again in the 21st century.</p> 
<p>God&rsquo;s Word does teach that we can exercise our will freely in earthly 
matters. For example, we are free to choose what to have for breakfast, in what 
profession we wish to serve, whom and when to marry, etc.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, because of the biblical teaching of original sin, we do 
not believe that human beings have a free will in spiritual matters. 1Cor 2:14
</p> 
<p>Unless the Holy Spirit working through the Gospel raises us to spiritual 
life, we will remain in spiritual bondage.</p> 
<p>Only the Holy Spirit can create faith, which He does by showing us Jesus.
</p> 
<p>Lutherans frequently use the word trust to describe the nature of faith or 
as a synonym for the word faith. Who creates trust? The one who trusts or the 
one who is trusted?</p> 
<p>(Illustration of 4-month old Dirk who trusts in 9 year old brother Seth and 
not his 3 year old sister Kirsten).</p> 
<p>Faith can only be created only by the one who is believed. The message 
about Jesus &ndash; who He is, what He has done for us &ndash; is the message 
that brings us to faith in God.</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit shows us Jesus, how much He loved us, how He sacrificed 
Himself for us..</p> 
<p>The Holy Spirit shows us how trustworthy the Savior is, and faith is the 
result. Thus faith is created by the Spirit through His Word. Because of faith, 
we are justified, we enter the kingdom of God, and we enter the church.</p> 
<p>Isaiah 62:1<br>
 1 For Zion&rsquo;s sake I will not be silent, and for 
Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake I will not rest, until its righteousness goes out as 
brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.</p> 
<p>&mdash;-</p> 
<p>We know that God has called us by name in Baptism and washed away our sins. 
We know that by faith we are holy. There is another calling given to each 
person &ndash; that of Christian vocation, which is a holy calling.</p> 
<p>It is in the daily life of a baptized that God shows love to the family and 
to the world.</p> 
<p>Martin Luther states that God has appointed many different stations or 
offices in life so the love of Jesus may be made manifest.</p> 
<p>When we love our neighbor, we love Jesus. When we serve our neighbor, we 
serve Jesus. When we do tasks God gives us to do, our actions show love for God 
and glorify Him.</p> 
<p>Our calling or vocation in life has been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb. 
Everything we do is holy by faith in Christ.</p> 
<p>According to God&rsquo;s Word, in God&rsquo;s eyes only believers do a good 
work. Only the deed done in faith is acceptable. Romans 14:23b</p> 
<p>St Paul described the spiritual condition of the Ephesian congregation 
before faith in this way:</p> 
<p>Ephesians 2:1<br>
 1 And He has made you alive, who were once dead in 
trespasses and sins,</p> 
<p>Eph 2:4-6</p> 
<p>Believers are alive.</p> 
<p>Apart from Christ, there is no such thing as a goood work in God&rsquo;s 
eyes. John 15: 5</p> 
<p>Heb 11:6 &ldquo;Without faith it is impossible to please God.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Faith is created by God. Therefore, faith is a vibrant, living thing.</p> 
<p>Faith certainly includes the understanding of various facts explained in 
Scripture, but faith is more than just understanding. Faith is trust in God. 
Faith is love for God. Faith is a desiree to be with God. Faith is faithful to 
the one who has been so kind, good, and gracious to us. Faith brings us into 
the family of God. It involves our relationship to our Father through the work 
of His Son.</p> 
<p>Luther in his preface to Romans said: </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Faith does not ask if good works are to be done, but before one can 
ask, faith has already done them and is constantly active.. Faith is a vital, 
deliberate trust in God&rsquo;s grace, so certain that it would die a thousand 
times for it. And such confidence and knowledge of divine grace makes us 
joyous, mettlesome, and merry toward God and all creatures. This the Holy 
Spirit works by faith, and therefore without coercion a man is willing and 
desirous to do good to everyone, to serve everyone, to suffer everything for 
the love of God and to his glory, who has been so gracious to him. It is 
therefore as impossible to separate works from faith as it is to separate heat 
and light from fire.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Faith is dynamic. It expresses itself in words and actions. Faith expresses 
itslef in love. Good works can never save, but true faith never exists without 
them. Even then, it is the Holy Spirit who creates the good works.</p> 
<p>The kind of life we live flows from the faith that lives in our hearts.</p> 
<p>Romans 6:1-4; 11-12</p> 
<p>To die to sin means more than simply that we are forgiven. It also means 
that we now live to the glory of God.</p> 
<p>To be forgiven means the sins that used to accuse us can&rsquo;t accuse us 
anymore. They&rsquo;re dead. The sins and guilt that used to condemn us 
can&rsquo;t condemn us anymore. They&rsquo;re dead.</p> 
<p>Rom 6:6; Col 2:14</p> 
<p>This forgiven life brings us the new life of holiness. We do not have to be 
afraid of doing the right thing. Rom 6: 13-14</p> 
<p>Precisely because we have died to sin, we now worship and love God daily. 
We worship and love God daily as we love and serve our neighbors, our family 
members, even strangers.</p> 
<p>In our Baptism, we died to sin and were buried with Christ. We were born 
aagain and now live a new life in Him by faith. Through faith in Jesus, we have 
become the temple of the Holy Spirit (1Cor 6:19).</p> 
<p>Christians are always sinners and saints at the same time. We do not stop 
being sinful when we become Christians. The more we understand the Law, the 
more we realize we cannot live up to its demands for perfection. We need a 
Savior no less today than the day on which we were baptized. Christians live a 
lifelong struggle with sin. 1Cor 7:21-24</p> 
<p>Frequently, we fail in our struggle with temptation. We sin daily. But 
through faith in Jesus, we stand holy, pure, and innocent in God&rsquo;s eyes.
</p> 
<p>We are light Paul, wretched in our inability to do what is right and at the 
same time rejoicing in the victory we have through Jesus Christ our Savior.</p> 
<p>We can thank Jesus for grace that is not cheap but precious, the grace that 
opens the gates of heaven and places us on Mount Zion.</p> 
<p>Only God&rsquo;s love for us in Christ gives us the Christian life. In this 
sense Christians are unique in their relationship to God. All other religions 
offer salvation onl to those who meet legal demands. Other religions present a 
god who punishes all those who break his rules and promises salvation only to 
those who keep all the rules. Adherents of these works-based religions live in 
constant spiritual anguish, never confident that their god loves them or 
accepts them. They are never sure their deeds have been done well enough. In 
such a religious life, obedience is rendered not out of love for their god but 
out of fear and the desire to avoid judgment and punishment.</p> 
<p>Do we keep God&rsquo;s Law because He will damn us if we don&rsquo;t? No. 
God has washed away all our guilt through Christ, His Son. He will not damn us. 
Do we keep God&rsquo;s Law because we are afraid of what He will do to us if we 
don&rsquo;t? No. Rom 8:1</p> 
<p>The center of the Christian faith is that God has punished Christ in our 
place. God is not angry with us because He truly loves us through Christ, His 
Son, and sees us as His dear children. We are now free to serve Him out of 
love. God has created love for Him and for His family, the church, in our 
hearts.</p> 
<p>The Gospel declares us holy, so now we see God&rsquo;s Law eye-to-eye and 
it does not kill us. We are free to live it.</p> 
<p>When we see how greatly God has loved us, and truly believe that His love 
is for us, we cannot help but love God in return. At the center of this 
relationship of love between God and His people is Jesus. It is for 
Jesus&rsquo; sake that the Father loves us, and it is because of what Jesus has 
done that we love the Father. Without the Savior, we could not and would not 
love God.</p> 
<p>Love is born not out of condemnation but out of forgiveness, not out of 
terror but out of faith, not out of despair but out of hope.</p> 
<p>Only the message of forgiveness in Jesus creates faith, hope, and true love.
</p> 
<p>It is difficult for preachers and laypeople, parents and children to grasp 
and live out the fact that only the Gospel creates love, not the Law. Only the 
message of Christ&rsquo;s work for us creates love for God in the hearts of 
Christians.</p> 
<p>Christians do not obey God because He demands love. Christians do not honor 
God because they will be damned if they don&rsquo;t. Christians do not serve 
God because they are afraid of His anger.</p> 
<p>Jesus is the center of all we do and say because He took our sin on 
Himself, suffered for us, died for us, and rose for us. Because of Jesus, we 
love God.</p> 
<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p> 
<p>John 16:33<br>
 33 I have spoken these things to you so that you might have 
peace in Me. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I 
have overcome the world.</p> 
<p>Matt 26:38 My soul is very sorrowful, even to death.</p> 
<p>Living in Zion is living the life of the cross. Because Zion understands 
life as it really is, Lutherans do not live in denial. Our Lord understands 
real humaan beings: We are sinners and saints at the same time (Rom 7:19ff).</p>
<p>We are holy by faith, but our thoughts, words, and deeds are immersed in 
sin. Thus Christians are always at war with themselves. This war is waged under 
the cross, but it brings pain, suffering, and hardship to Christians just as 
life brings the same to everyone who lives on earth.</p> 
<p>There is a far more popular understanding of Zion promulgated tooday that 
is not found in the Scriptures. It is called a &ldquo;theology of glory,&rdquo; 
which may also be called the believers&rsquo; prosperity.</p> 
<p>The theology of glory posits that if we are good to God, God will be good 
to us; if we are faithful to God, God will be faithful to us; if we follow God, 
worship God, and obey God, God will pay us our due.</p> 
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t give us everything we ask for or good health or money or 
success because we have enough faith.</p> 
<p>Christians often have just as many problems as their non-believing 
neighbors &ndash; and sometimes more. Christians become sick. They are involved 
in accidents, they suffered pain, financial difficulty, failed marriages, 
dysfunctional families, disobedient and rebellious children, abusive spouses, 
apathetic parents. Christians must endure humiliation, shame, embarrassment, 
temptations that never seem to end, even persecution. In addition, christians 
are troubled by sin, they struggle with sin.</p> 
<p>Christians bleed and hurt and die just like everybody else, which is one 
reason Christians often are considered foolish and pathetic by non-believers. 
It&rsquo;s also why we who are Christians sometimes become discouraged.</p> 
<p>St Paul touches on the great paradox that joy and trouble go hand in hand 
in the life of the Christian. 1 Thess 1:6</p> 
<p>God does not promise us an end to trouble and suffering until our term on 
earth has ended.</p> 
<p>Matt 16:24</p> 
<p>Just as Jesus bore a cross when He came to save us, so we who follow Him 
also bear a cross.</p> 
<p>What does Jesus say will happen to His disciples if they are faithful to 
Him?</p> 
<p>Mark 13:9; Matt 5:10-12 (persecution)</p> 
<p>Christians will be persecuted, made fun of, ostracized, or penalized in 
some way. When we live as Christians, we bear a cross as Jesus did.</p> 
<p>As a pastor stands at the foot of a hospital bed or meets with someone 
whose marriage is dissolving or counsels someone whose spouse has died, he 
often hears the questions Why? And Where is God&rsquo;s love? And Where is 
God&rsquo;s mercy?</p> 
<p>1Cor 10:13; Heb 4:15-16; Matt 28:20; Ps 50:15; 1Peter 2:11; 1Peter 1:4; Rom 
8:18, 28</p> 
<p>Even as Christians, our sinful flesh continues to tempt us to believe that 
we can ddo without God&rsquo;s grace, without His mercy, without Christ. The 
devil tries to seduce us away from Mount Calvary and send us back to Mount 
Sinai. He tempts us to trust our own abilities. But God loves us, so He shows 
us our weaknesses and places crosses on us to return us to Calvary, to cause us 
to cry out daily to Him for mercy.</p> 
<p>The crosses Christians bear are sent by God not only for the benefit of the 
one who bears the cross but also for the benefit of others. Christians need to 
remember that we are all members of one church. We are family &ndash; 
God&rsquo;s family. And what do family members do for one another? They help 
one another..</p> 
<p>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all 
rejoice together.. 1Cor 12:25-27. Thus the crosses God sends us, as well as the 
joys, are meant to bless the entire family of God.</p> 
<p>When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? Matt 25:34-40. Thus in 
showing love to other Christians, in helping them bear their crosses, we show 
our love for Jesus.</p> 
<p>The cross of suffering has become a sign for all Christians, a sign of 
salvation, hope, and everlasting life. Rom 8:28</p> 
<p>When we look to Jesus, we see a baby and know that He does not come to 
frighten us but to draw us to Himself in love.</p> 
<p>When we look to Jesus, we see temptation in the wilderness and know that He 
does not come to intimidate us with threats of punishment for sin and failure. 
He understands our temptations because He has experienced them, and He comes to 
love and comfort us.</p> 
<p>When we look to Jesus, we see Him in the Garden of Gethsemane in such 
anguish that He sweats drops of blood. We see Him whipped and crowned with 
thorns, suffering great pain on the cross, and finally dying. Thus we are 
assured that Jesus knows our pain.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we see Jesus bearing the guilt and sin of the whole world on 
that cross and know that He understands our shame.</p> 
<p>Christ has removed our shame and guilt. He has conquered death for us. Now 
He gives everything that is His to us: His life of perfection, His conquest of 
sin and temptation, His death that pays for all guilt, His resurrection and 
life.</p> 
<p>If we succumb to these temptations, they would lead us to the foot of Mount 
Sinai where we would stand alone under God&rsquo;s Law. But St Paul says,</p> 
<p>Romans 3:20<br>
 20 because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will 
be justified in His sight; for through the Law is the knowledge of sin.</p> 
<p>We should keep our eyes on Jesus, </p> 
<p>Hebrews 12:2<br>
 2 looking to Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith, 
who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, 
and sat down at the right of the throne of God.</p> 
<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p> 
<p>Jesus is the Lamb, the great Passover Lamb.</p> 
<p>When the children of Israel had lived in Egypt for 430 years, God sent His 
prophet Moses to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go..</p> 
<p>So God decided to send His angel to strike dead all the firstborn of the 
people of Egypt. Meanwhile, God prepared the Israelites for this plague by 
instructing them to kill a lamb, eat it, and spread its blood on the doorposts 
and lintels of their homes.</p> 
<p>Thus the angel of death passed over the homes protected by the blood of a 
lamb but took the firstborn of all the families of Egypt. Then Pharaoh let the 
people go, and the Israelites began their exodus from Egypt.</p> 
<p>In the person of Jesus a greater lamb has come, a lamb that had to be 
sacrificed so the greatest Passover of all could occur. This Lamb of God was 
sacrificed for the sins of the whole world, and now God passes over all our 
guilt, shame, and every single sin we have ever committed.</p> 
<p>Thus when life on this earth is over, the soul of the believer goes 
immediately to heaven to be with God.</p> 
<p>Our soul will be with our Lord in Paradise while our body lies in the 
grave, awaiting the Day in Resurrection and the return of our Lord. One day 
each of us will meet death, but for those who live in Zion, death gives way to 
a new and eternal life.</p> 
<p>Jesus conquers death by raising Himself from death to life. The importance 
of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection cannot be overestimated. The Christian faith 
stands or falls with the resurrection of Jesus. Any faith without the 
resurrection of Jesus is nonsense. If the one who came to save us from death 
lies still and cold forever in a grave, Christianity is a sad joke. 1Cor 
15:17-19</p> 
<p>Those who den the resurrection of Jesus and who would reduce Christianity 
to a set of moral principles have little to do with the apostle Paul, who 
declares.. Rom 10:9; 1Cor 15:14-15, 20, 57.</p> 
<p>Jesus&rsquo; resurrection is a victory for us.</p> 
<p>History has known many hours but none as black as those hours when the Son 
of God was on the cross. There the powers of evil converged on Jesus and 
released their full fury. Who could have believed that any good could come out 
of this?</p> 
<p>But God took this darkest moment and out of it He brought forgiveness, 
life, and everlasting glory. That is why our faith ultimately can conquer evil 
in this world &ndash; not because nothing will ever go wrong for us and we will 
never suffer, never sin, and never succumb to temptation, but because the Son 
of God took on Himself our human flesh and His suffering, death, and 
resurrection robbed the devil and his evil forces of all hope for a final 
victory.</p> 
<p>In fact, Jesus&rsquo; resurrection is the declaration that God already has 
defeated all evil through Christ, His Son. In the resurrection God has passed 
sentence on Satan and on all the evil that nailed Christ on the cross.</p> 
<p>Rev 1:17-18</p> 
<p>Because Jesus lives, the final victory over sin, over death, and over hell 
belongs to every Christian. It is not a losing cause to be a Christian.</p> 
<p>Believers do not go to death as slaves or as prisoners to a dungeon. 
Rather, they go through death into the presence of their victorious Savior.</p> 
<p>Revelation 14:13<br>
 13 And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 
Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the 
Spirit, they shall rest from their labors, and their works follow them.<br>
 
Luke 23:43; John 11:25-26</p> 
<p>Death is not the termination of human existence. Death is not the snuffing 
out of the human being. In fact, when a Christian dies, the angel of death 
passes over completely. Although we may place the body in the ground, the soul 
of that person is in heaven with Jesus and the angels and all the saints.</p> 
<p>When Jesus said from the cross that &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; those 
words meant that His victory had been completed.</p> 
<p>Matt 27:51 Now that the Lamb of God had been sacrificed, the curtain was 
torn from top to bottom because this Lamb had taken away the sins of the world. 
Now nothing separates us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord 
&ndash; not even death.</p> 
<p>Finally, on the last day, when our Lord returns to judge the living and the 
dead, He will raise our bodies to life again. Then our souls and bodies will be 
reunited, and we will live forever in the kingdom Jesus has prepared for us 
from the foundation of the world. Matt 25:34</p> 
<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p> 
<p>Without the treasures of God&rsquo;s grace, Zion dies. Without the Gospel, 
the church cannot survive. Without forgiveness, faith expires. The benefits of 
Calvary must continue to be dispensed to Zion.</p> 
<p>Augsburg Confession, the Book of Concord, Theodore Tappert, pg 31:</p> 
<p>In order that we may obtain this faith, the ministry of teaching the Gospel 
and administering the sacraments was insstituted. For through the Word and the 
sacraments, as through instruments, the Holy Spirit is given, and the Holy 
Spirit produces faith, where and when it pleases God, in those who hear the 
Gospel. That is to say, it is not on account of our own merits but on account 
of Christ that God justified those who believe that they are received into 
favor for Christ&rsquo;s sake. Gal 3:14</p> 
<p>God provides for all His people&rsquo;s needs. The Father sends His Son to 
earn forgiveness for us. The Father and the Son send the Spirit to cause the 
apostles too record the news of this wonderful salvation. Then God establishes 
the office of the ministry of the Word of the prophets and the apostles will 
continue to be preached to God&rsquo;s people until the Savior returns.</p> 
<p>Through this office, God causes His church to grow. Through this office, 
the Gospel will be proclaimed and people will be brought to and sustained in 
the faith. Therefore, aa pastor is primarily a preacher or a proclaimer of 
God&rsquo;s Word and specifically of God&rsquo;s grace.</p> 
<p>As far as Luther is concerned, the feeding of the flock and the growth of 
the church occurs only when the Word is preached.</p> 
<p>The pastor&rsquo;s preaching should always be focused on Christ. The office 
of the ministry itself is Christocentric, that is, Christ is at the center. 
Therefore, this office constantly points to Jesus, His person and His work, so 
faith in the Son of God may be created and the church expanded.</p> 
<p>The proper work of a pastor is, in the words of Luther, to speak &ldquo;a 
word of salvation, a word of grace, a word of comfort, a word of joy, a voice 
of the bridegroom and the bride, a good word, a word of peace&rdquo; so the 
church may rejoice in the knowledge of her salvation.</p> 
<p>Martin Luther: &ldquo;May every single sermon be forever damned which 
persuades a person to find security and trust in or through anything whatever 
except the pure mercy of God, which is Christ.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The office of the ministry is not a Mosaic office. It is not an office 
meant to bring people to Sinai to encourage them to live there, to gain their 
hope there, and to stand before God there. The office of pastor is an office of 
the Gospel. 1Cor 9:16 Paul never said, Woe to me if I do not preach the Law.</p>
<p>This does not mean that pastors should not preach the Law, which they must 
do if people are to see the futility of living on Sinai and embrace the riches 
of Calvary so they might live on Zion.</p> 
<p>The preaching of the Gospel is despised when people do not hear the Law and 
come to the knowledge of their sin. But the glory of the pastoral ministry is 
not in preaching God&rsquo;s Law, which condemns. At the center of the pastoral 
ministry is Christ, who brings grace, forgiveness, salvation, and life.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, in many churches preachers do not seem to understand the 
nature of their own office. Thus the major thrust of their preaching is not on 
the grace and forgiveness found in the Savior but on the importance of living a 
good life. This sends hearers back to Sinai!</p> 
<p>But the office of pastor is not centered on Sinai &ndash; it is centered on 
Christ Christ is the center of the Gospel, which brings the message of 
forgiveness through His suffering and death.</p> 
<p>The office of the ministry is not an office about the pastor, it is an 
office about Jesus. It is an office created by God to proclaim Jesus as Savior, 
as the one who bore all the world&rsquo;s sin and guilt that He might bring 
grace and forgiveness to sinners.</p> 
<p>For pastors, this means that when they preach about Jesus they are to 
preach not only that He is the Son of God but also that He is the Son of God 
who came to forgive. They are to preach not only that He died on the cross but 
also that He died on a cross for our sins, to forgive us so we could live 
forever..</p> 
<p>People need to hear that Jesus brings grace it is wonderful that people 
believe the pastor when he preaches about Trinity, the incarnation.. But these 
teachings will not cause the people rejoice unless they know what Jesus has 
done for them. Such rejoicing occurs when the pastor preaches about the 
forgiveness of sins.</p> 
<p>Faithful pastors want people to live, not perish, so they preach the 
Gospel. They proclaim to people that no matter what they have done God forgives 
it. No matter what shame they feel, God washes them clean. No matter what 
wrongs haunt them and never leave them in peace, Jesus, the Lamb of God, has 
taken them all away.</p> 
<p>Pastors proclaim that grace not only covers every sin, grace is universal, 
which means it covers every sinner. No one can say that Jesus didn&rsquo;t come 
for men didn&rsquo;t die for me. 1Cor 5:19</p> 
<p>When pastors preach the Gospel in this way, the people of God rejoice 
because they see Jesus. They see Him not as one rising out of the thunder, 
lightning, and smoke of Sinai to condemn, accuse, and threaten, but as the 
crucified one who forgives, saves, and justifies. John 3:17</p> 
<p>The truth that we are justified by grace through faith in Jesus Christ is 
the doctrine on which the church stands or falls. It is the central teaching of 
the Christian faith. This truth should always stand at the center of Christian 
preaching: God loves and forgives us for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Rom 4:25-5:2</p> 
<p>The office of pastor is not about the one who holds the office but about 
the one who instituted the office. 1Cor 2:2; John 3:30</p> 
<p>Pastors spend many years ..preaching, marrying, burying, comforting, 
admonishing sinners, visiting the sick.. They do this for one purpose: that the 
flock of Christ may know the Shepherd, that sinners may know the Savior. John 
1:29</p> 
<p>C.F.W. Walther: &ldquo;It is a great and awful sin not to draw any soul 
that has been entrusted to us for instruction to Jesus and not tell that soul 
again and again what a treasure it has in the Lord Jesus, its Savior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p> 
<p>At the center of God&rsquo;s Word is Jesus Christ. Thus Jesus is at the 
center of all Christian worship. John 15:5; 14:6</p> 
<p>All worship apart from Jesus does not worship the true God because apart 
from Jesus we cannot know God as a loving, gracious Father who forgives and 
saves sinners for the sake of His Son who gave Himself for them.</p> 
<p>We must be on guard that worship does not degenerate into moralistic 
sermons dominated by Law or songs that make no mention of Jesus&rsquo; work of 
salvation. Such worship practices deprive people of the joy of truly Christian 
worship.</p> 
<p>When worship does not focus on Jesus, it is impossible for the Holy Spirit 
to create and sustain true faith in the hearts of the people because the Holy 
Spirit creates faith only by showing people the Savior, Jesus.</p> Comment <br>

<p>&ldquo;The Greatest!!&rdquo; #78-52<br>
 Presented on The Lutheran Hour on 
September 4, 2011<br>
 By Rev. Gregory Seltz, Speaker of The Lutheran Hour</p> 
<p>Matthew 18:1-4</p> 
<p>Grace and peace to you in Jesus&rsquo; Name, Amen.</p> 
<p>Do you remember who said this&hellip;. &ldquo;I float like a butterfly and 
I sting like a bee?&rdquo; Yes, those are the words of one Mohammed Ali. Now, 
for some people, Ali was the greatest heavyweight boxer who ever lived. For 
others, he was a controversial political figure, a lightning rod in the midst 
of Vietnam politics and the civil rights movement. Now, today, I&rsquo;m not 
going to talk about his politics, or his religion. I&rsquo;m not even going to 
give you &ldquo;my opinion&rdquo; of whether he was the best boxer that ever 
lived (because I&rsquo;m probably more of a Joe Frazier, George Foreman fan). 
Now, what I do want to talk to you about, though, is his bravado, his 
braggadociousness.</p> 
<p>Before his fight with Britain&rsquo;s Henry Cooper, He said, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not only the greatest. I&rsquo;m the double greatest. Not only 
do I knock &lsquo;em out, I pick the round. I&rsquo;m the boldest, the 
prettiest, the most superior, the most scientific, most skillfulest fighter in 
the ring today.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Well, not too long ago, they made a movie about his life. It was called; 
you guessed it, &ldquo;The Greatest.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So, what is it about such bravado that seems to attract us to our heroes? 
Why do we elevate their status to such heights when it becomes apparent, as it 
always does, that our heroes have feet of clay? Why do we have scores of 
magazines whose only concern is &ldquo;Who is the greatest, who is the most 
powerful, who makes the most money, who are the most beautiful,&rdquo; when all 
of these things are temporal and fleeting?</p> 
<p>Well, for many of us, that bravado attracts us because we hope that if we 
can glean merely a nugget of wisdom from folks like them, if we can mimic their 
successful actions, maybe, just maybe we can have control of our lives just 
like them. With the honor of being the greatest in our society or even among 
our family and friends, with that honor comes power, prestige, and 
status&hellip;.even control. And isn&rsquo;t that what life is all about?</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s what Jesus&rsquo; Disciples were looking for from Him that 
day. I think they were sure that they had attached themselves to the next big 
thing. They had seen Jesus do miracles of healing and feeding. They had 
experienced the Mount of Transfiguration glow of His godliness. Peter, in front 
of all the others, had even for a moment walked on water with Him. This Jesus 
was something special and they had an inside track into His new kingdom. So, 
they were the chosen ones, and now they want to know what that might mean for 
them.</p> 
<p>So they ask Jesus, a very modern question &ldquo;Who is the 
greatest?&rdquo; But, why? Do they really want to know if Jesus is proud of 
them? Do they really want to know if they have met His high standards for 
leadership and service? I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think 
they&rsquo;re concern is excellence, or holiness, or faithfulness from 
God&rsquo;s point of view.</p> 
<p>No, their desire for that answer is much like our desire for that answer. 
They want to know how they stack up among each other. They want to know 
&ldquo;Who is the greatest among them&rdquo; so that the others can get in line 
behind them. They&rsquo;re hoping that Jesus will pick out the greatest ones 
(of course, hoping that He picks them), so that they can finally get the status 
and the influence they deserve.</p> 
<p>James and John wanted positions of power in Jesus&rsquo; kingdom. Peter 
speaks up on behalf of the group, as if he&rsquo;s already the one in charge. 
Earlier, he had even challenged Jesus&rsquo; kingdom leadership when he rebuked 
Jesus&rsquo; talk about suffering and crosses in His kingdom.</p> 
<p>The question they, like we, often raise, is, &ldquo;Who is in charge here? 
Who has the power to do as he or she pleases?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oops, Jesus, what 
we meant to ask is, &lsquo;Who is the greatest in your kingdom.&rsquo; Please, 
tell us what you think!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;And He said: &lsquo;I tell you the truth, unless you change and 
become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 
Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the 
kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Jesus is very clear who is the greatest. Not the one whose whole goal in 
life is to go it completely on their own, to go it alone.</p> 
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be misunderstood here. Striving to be the best 
that God has created and redeemed you to be, to do your very best in Him for 
others, such things are very laudable. This isn&rsquo;t that kind of 
discussion. This is more of a &ldquo;Who has the ultimate power; who is in 
complete control;&rdquo; or maybe say it this way, &ldquo;who gets to tell 
everyone else what to do no matter what?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that kind of 
question. It takes bravado to even think that you are that person, 
doesn&rsquo;t it? Imagine the kind of bravado, then, it takes to ask the very 
Son of God that question, too.</p> 
<p>The problem with such bravado is that it asserts our complete independence 
even from God. The first sin of humanity in the Garden of Eden was Adam and Eve 
saying, &ldquo;Dear Father in heaven, I think we&rsquo;ll go it alone.&rdquo; 
The rebellion of humanity, the sinful condition of humanity in which we find 
ourselves today, is not merely about whether we do sinful things. It is about 
doing it our way, cutting ourselves off from the one in whom we live, and move, 
and have our being.</p> 
<p>To be the greatest on these terms is to foolishly assert that you can go it 
alone; to be dependent only on what you can do, what you can say, what you can 
make happen with the resources under your control. If that&rsquo;s who you are 
today, it won&rsquo;t take you long to discover how tenuous your control of 
life really is.</p> 
<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;Pride, human over-confidence, goeth before the 
fall.&rdquo; And human history is littered with such self-destructiveness, but 
we never seem to learn from it, either for ourselves or for others. Such pride 
can even kill.</p> 
<p>During a 1923 training exercise, a naval destroyer called the USS Delphy 
led a flotilla of seven vessels down the California coast. The USS Delphy was 
captained by Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, an experienced navigator 
and an instructor of the Naval Academy. Without warning, about half way on 
their training mission, a thick blanket of fog descended on the ships. In the 
midst of the fog, Hunter could not get an accurate evaluation of his location. 
Contrary to his calculations, the ship was headed right into Devil&rsquo;s Jaw, 
a scant two miles off the California coast. But that didn&rsquo;t stop Hunter 
from plowing ahead. Now, that is not surprising, for Hunter was known for his 
self-confident decisiveness and what others called his magic infallibility to 
guide his ship.</p> 
<p>Traveling at 20 knots, suddenly the USS Delphy smashed broadside into the 
rocky Point Arguello shoreline. The force of the massive collision of welded 
steel and jagged rock split the hull of the Delphy in half. One by one, the 
other destroyers followed the Delphy&rsquo;s lead and they smashed into the 
rocks as well. Twenty-two naval men died. The accident resulted in the loss of 
all seven ships. It still stands as one of the worst peacetime naval disasters 
in history.</p> 
<p>But this is merely another example of human beings not realizing their 
limitations, their dependency even for the sake of excellence. Human 
overconfidence, plus human fallibility means that life&rsquo;s questions need 
bigger answers than we can provide. Our greatness will not be up to the task, 
even for some of the things we can control. But such bravado is eternally 
deadly when our self-centered, over-confidence exists in the arena of our 
spiritual lives, our life with God. Such selfish, self-focus literally 
disconnects us from the One Who created and redeemed us to live life abundantly 
in His Name.</p> 
<p>I hate to be the one to tell you this even if you are a powerful person 
today. The day is coming when you will be vulnerable again. Mohammed Ali can no 
longer &ldquo;float like a butterfly or sting like a bee.&rdquo; Frank Sinatra 
can no longer &ldquo;do it his way,&rdquo; and General MacArthur &ldquo;will 
not be returning,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;Elvis has learned that Graceland is 
not something he could create, but something that one can only receive as a 
gift from the hands of a gracious God.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Jesus said: &ldquo;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like 
little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever 
humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>So, Who is the Greatest? Who is the Greatest in the kingdom of heaven? The 
One Who is totally dependent on God for His source of life and strength, like a 
little child.</p> 
<p>Jesus calls a child into their midst. He calls a child forth as His example 
of Greatness. Now, He&rsquo;s not saying &ldquo;Be like this child&rdquo; as if 
the child were blameless and holy.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that kids in Jesus&rsquo; day were much like kids in our 
day. They have the same bravado issues as we. I was recently waiting several 
hours at an airport to catch my final flight home from the East Coast. On that 
trip, we had to wait for a plane to be fixed, so, you know, it took quite a 
while. While waiting, I got a chance to see several kids playing together at 
the airport gate. I don&rsquo;t know what they were playing, but I could hear 
them saying over and over again. &ldquo;Aaron, look at me. Mommy, Daddy, look 
at what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; Do you see me; did you see what I did? And that 
game went on for at least an hour. There were those questions, &ldquo;Am I the 
best? Am I better than you? Are we going to play the games I want to play, with 
my rules or yours?&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t take long for us, even when 
we&rsquo;re young, to start asking those questions, does it?</p> 
<p>So, Jesus isn&rsquo;t putting a child on display for that reason. 
He&rsquo;s trying to show these Disciples that their greatness and strength 
with God comes from &ldquo;knowing your dependency on Him and trusting in Him 
for all things.&rdquo; Yes, like a child. &ldquo;If you want to see what 
greatness is in the kingdom of God, just look around,&rdquo; says Jesus. 
&ldquo;Be like this child!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Kids? Yes, not the independently powerful, or the personally suave, or 
debonair? How can this be? Well, Jesus is clear, a child who trusts dependently 
on Him has more going for them than an adult who trusts in themselves because 
they are dependent on the One Who eternally loves them and completely provides 
for them. Children, from the very start, are dependent on their parents for 
food and protection. Their wisdom comes as they watch their parents and mimic 
what they see. Their confidence grows as they take up the challenges of life 
under a parent&rsquo;s encouraging and resourcing eye.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason that Christians joyfully receive the title, 
&ldquo;Children of God.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not because we are young and 
na&iuml;ve. It&rsquo;s not because we are trying to avoid the tough questions 
and issues of adulthood. No, being a child of God means that we never forget 
the ultimate source of our forgiveness, our strength, our wisdom, our life, 
even our peace in this tense world. All of it comes from a simple trust in God 
who provides all things for us.</p> 
<p>The famous theologian, Karl Barth, one of the great minds of the 20th 
century, was being interviewed by a group of seminary students one day. The 
question was asked, &ldquo;What is the most profound thought that ever occupied 
your mind.&rdquo; They thought that he might expound on existentialist 
theology. They thought that they would hear him speak about the power of faith 
to face down the evils of Nazism and secularism. But, after thinking about the 
question for a moment, Barth answered, &ldquo;Jesus loves me this I know for 
the Bible tells me so.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Childlike trust in the One Who died on the cross for you and rose from the 
grave for you, childlike trust in the One Who loves you with an everlasting 
love, Who is for you and all who believe, He is our righteousness, our 
holiness, our wisdom, this is not childishness, this is not child&rsquo;s play, 
this is the beginning of living the powerful life of faith in Jesus now and 
forever.</p> 
<p>I remember watching the TV show, &ldquo;Savage Seas,&rdquo; and on this 
particular show, a large ocean vessel was sailing in the Bering Sea. An 
ice-pack trapped a fishing vessel and literally began to crush it among its 
powerful waves. Huge &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; waves of icy salt water threatened 
to sweep the whole crew overboard. The captain tried in vain to steer the 
vessel to safety, but to no avail. And, finally, a helicopter arrived, pulling 
the crew to safety, one by one. Now, the very last person off the boat was the 
captain. As the weather started to close in, they had trouble even getting him 
into the basket. Then a wave threw him over the side of the boat onto the 
undulating ice flow. Totally exhausted, with no strength left, he was helpless. 
Fortunately, they were able to put the basket down close to him one last time 
and he was carried away, finally, to safety.</p> 
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure that captain felt as helpless as a child on that boat. 
I&rsquo;m sure that he was trying as hard as he could to take full control of 
the situation. But, in the end, the most important thing that he could do was 
to recognize his utter need for help and let them pull him to safety.</p> 
<p>Human beings always seem to worry about who is the greatest for the wrong 
reasons. But our lesson finally clues us in as to Who the greatest is of all 
times. The Disciples are literally standing in His presence. And His greatness 
is not defined by His personal status, though it could be since there is no One 
like Him. He would be great in and of Himself, that&rsquo;s for sure. But, His 
true greatness is that He set aside that status for you. His ultimate greatness 
is defined by what He brings to you and to all who trust in Him. Jesus points 
to the child because the child points straight back to Him.</p> 
<p>So, be careful then even how you define greatness and power. Soren 
Kierkegaard, the great Danish theologian of another century, tells the story of 
true greatness and love. He tells the story of a prince who was running an 
errand for his father one day in the local village. As he did so, he passed 
through a very poor section of town. Looking through the window of his 
carriage, he saw a beautiful young peasant girl walking along the street. He 
could not get her off his heart. He continued to come to the town, day after 
day, just to see her and to feel as though he was near her.</p> 
<p>His heart yearned for her, but there was a problem. How could he develop a 
relationship with her? He could order her to marry him. It was in his power to 
do so. But he wanted this girl to love him from the heart, willingly. He could 
put on his royal garments and impress her with his regal entourage, and drive 
up to her front door with soldiers and a carriage drawn by six horses. But if 
he did this, he would never be certain that the girl loved him or was simply 
overwhelmed with his power, position, and wealth.</p> 
<p>So, the prince came up with another solution. As you may have guessed, he 
gave up his kingly robe and symbols of power and prestige. He moved into the 
village dressed only as a peasant. He lived among the people, shared their 
interests and their concerns, and he talked their language. In time, the young 
peasant girl grew to know him, and then to love him, and with that all that he 
had became hers as well.</p> 
<p>If you wish to define greatness, just look at this Jesus, Who He is and 
what He has done for you. When He stands before you, offering you His life and 
salvation as a gift, serving you with His blessings and peace, don&rsquo;t be a 
stubborn, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it my way, self-proclaimed greatest 
adult,&rdquo; be like a child who smiles from ear to ear in the presence of the 
One Who loves you and makes His eternal life possible for you.</p> 
<p>Receiving all that Jesus is, all that He has done for you with simple 
trust, using all that He has given you in thankfulness to Him and in service to 
others, without regard to how it stacks up among the brethren. Now that&rsquo;s 
the kingdom greatness of God at work in your life, now and forever and go 
ahead, strive for that.</p> 
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Justification by Grace</p> 
<p>A Sermon delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 5, 1857, by the<br>
 REV. 
C.&nbsp;H. Spurgeon<br>
 at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is 
in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. 3:24.</p> 
<p>THE hill of comfort is the hill of calvary; the house of consolation is 
builded with the wood of the cross; the temple of heavenly cordials is founded 
upon the riven rock, riven by the spear which pierced its side. No scene in 
sacred history ever gladdens the soul like the scene on Calvary.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Is it not strange, the darkest hour<br>
 That ever dawn&rsquo;d on 
sinful earth<br>
 Should touch the heart with softer power<br>
 For comfort, 
than an angel&rsquo;s mirth?<br>
 That to the cross the mourner&rsquo;s eye 
should turn,<br>
 Sooner than where the stars of Bethlehem burn?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Nowhere does the soul ever find such consolation as on that very spot where 
misery reigned, where woe triumphed, where agony reached its climax. There 
grace hath dug a fountain, which ever gusheth with waters pure as crystal, each 
drop capable of alleviating the woes and the agonies of mankind. Ye have had 
your seasons of woe, my brethren and my sisters in Christ Jesus; and ye will 
confess it was not at Olivet that ye ever found comfort, not on the hill of 
Sinai, nor on Tabor; but Gethsemane, Gabbatha, and Golgotha have been a means 
of comfort to you. The bitter herbs of Gethsemane have often taken away the 
bitters of your life; the scourge of Gabbatha hath often scourged away your 
cares, and the groans of Calvary have put all other groans to flight.</p> 
<p>We have, this morning, then, a subject which I trust may be the means of 
comforting God&rsquo;s saints, seeing it takes its rise at the cross, and 
thence runs on in a rich stream of perennial blessing to all believers. You 
note, we have in our text, first of all, the redemption of Christ Jesus; 
secondly, the justification of sinners flowing from it; and then thirdly, the 
manner of the giving of this justification, &ldquo;freely by his grace.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>I. First, then, we have THE REDEMPTION THAT IS IN OR BY CHRIST JESUS.<br>
 
The figure of redemption is very simple, and has been very frequently used in 
Scripture. When a prisoner has been taken captive, and has been made a slave by 
some barbarous power, it has been usual, before he could be set free, that a 
ransom price should be paid down. Now, we being, by the fall of Adam, prone to 
guiltiness, and, indeed, virtually guilty, we were by the irreproachable 
judgment of God given up to the vengeance of the law; we were given into the 
hands of justice; justice claimed us to be his bond slaves for ever, unless we 
could pay a ransom, whereby our souls could be redeemed. We were, indeed, poor 
as owlets, we had not wherewith to bless ourselves. We were, as our hymn hath 
worded it, &ldquo;bankrupt debtors;&rdquo; an execution was put into our house; 
all we had was sold; we were left naked, and poor, and miserable, and we could 
by no means find a ransom; it was just then that Christ stepped in, stood 
sponsor for us, and, in the room and stead of all believers, did pay the ransom 
price, that we might in that hour be delivered from the curse of the law and 
the vengeance of God, and go our way, clean, free, justified by his blood.</p> 
<p>Let me just endeavour to show you some qualities of the redemption that is 
in Christ Jesus. You will remember the multitude he has redeemed; not me alone, 
nor you alone, but &ldquo;a multitude that no man can number,&rdquo; which 
shall as far exceed the stars of heaven for number, as they exceed all mortal 
reckoning. Christ hath bought for himself, some out of every kingdom, and 
nation, and tongue, under heaven; he hath redeemed from among men some of every 
rank, from the highest to the lowest; some of every colour&mdash;black and 
white; some of every standing in society, the best and the worst. For some of 
all sorts hath Jesus Christ given himself a ransom that they might be redeemed 
unto himself.</p> 
<p>Now, concerning this ransom, we have to observe, that it was all paid, and 
all paid at once. When Christ redeemed his people, he did it thoroughly; he did 
not leave a single debt unpaid, nor yet one farthing for them to settle 
afterwards. God demanded of Christ the payment for the sins of all his people; 
Christ stood forward, and to the utmost farthing paid whate&rsquo;er his people 
owed.</p> 
<p>The sacrifice of Calvary was not a part payment; it was not a partial 
exoneration, it was a complete and perfect payment, and it obtained a complete 
and perfect remittal of all the debts of all believers that have lived, do 
live, or shall live, to the very end of time. On that day when Christ hung on 
the cross, he did not leave a single farthing for us to pay as a satisfaction 
to God; he did not leave, from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, that he had not 
satisfied. The whole of the demands of the law were paid down there and then by 
Jehovah Jesus, the great high priest of all his people. And blessed be his 
name, he paid it all at once too. So priceless was the ransom, so princely and 
munificent was the price demanded for our souls, one might have thought it 
would have been marvellous if Christ had paid it by instalments; some of it 
now, and some of it then. King&rsquo;s ransoms have sometimes been paid part at 
once, and part in dues afterwards, to run through years. But not so our 
Saviour: once for all he gave himself a sacrifice; at once he counted down the 
price, and said, &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; leaving nothing for him to do, 
nor for us to accomplish. He did not drivel out a part-payment, and then 
declare that he would come again to die, or that he would again suffer, or that 
he would again obey; but down upon the nail, to the utmost farthing, the ransom 
of all people was paid, and a full receipt given to them, and Christ nailed 
that receipt to his cross, and said, &ldquo;It is done, it is done; I have 
taken away the handwriting of ordinances, I have nailed it to the cross; who is 
he that shall condemn my people, or lay anything to their charge? for I have 
blotted out like a cloud their transgressions, and like a thick cloud their 
sins!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And when Christ paid all this ransom, will you just notice, that he did it 
all himself! He was very particular about that. Simon, the Cyrenian, might bear 
the cross; but Simon, the Cyrenian, might not be nailed to it. That sacred 
circle of Calvary was kept for Christ alone. Two thieves were with him there; 
not righteous men, lest any should have said that the death of those two 
righteous men helped the Saviour. Two thieves hung there with him, that men 
might see that there was majesty in his misery, and that he could pardon men 
and show his sovereignty, even when he was dying. There were no righteous men 
to suffer; no disciples shared his death; Peter was not dragged there to be 
beheaded, John was not nailed to a cross side by side with him; he was left 
there alone. He says, &ldquo;I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the 
people there was none with me.&rdquo; The whole of the tremendous debt was put 
upon his shoulders; the whole weight of the sins of all his people was placed 
upon him.</p> 
<p>Once he seemed to stagger under it: &ldquo;Father, if it be 
possible.&rdquo; But again he stood upright: &ldquo;Nevertheless, not my will, 
but thine be done.&rdquo; The whole of the punishment of his people was 
distilled into one cup; no mortal lip might give it so much as a solitary sip. 
When he put it to his own lips, it was so bitter, he well nigh spurned 
it&mdash;&rdquo;Let this cup pass from me.&rdquo; But his love for his people 
was so strong, that he took the cup in both his hands, and</p> 
<p>&ldquo;At one tremendous draught of love<br>
 He drank damnation 
dry,&rdquo; for all his people. He drank it all, he endured all, he suffered 
all; so that now for ever there are no flames of hell for them, no racks of 
torment; they have no eternal woes; Christ hath suffered all they ought to have 
suffered, and they must, they shall go free. The work was completely done by 
himself, without a helper.<br>
 And note, again, it was accepted. In truth, it 
was a goodly ransom. What could equal it? A soul &ldquo;exceeding sorrowful 
even unto death;&rdquo; a body torn with torture; a death of the most inhuman 
kind; and an agony of such a character, that tongue cannot speak of it, nor can 
even man&rsquo;s mind imagine its horror. It was a goodly price. But say, was 
it accepted? There have been prices paid sometimes, or rather offered, which 
never were accepted by the party to whom they were offered, and therefore the 
slave did not go free. But this was accepted. The evidence I will shew you.</p> 
<p>When Christ declared that he would pay the debt for all his people, God 
sent the officer to arrest him for it; he arrested him in the garden of 
Gethsemane, and seizing upon him, he dragged him to the bar of Pilate, to the 
bar of Herod, and to the judgment seat of Caiaphas; the payment was all made, 
and Christ was put into the grave. He was there, locked up in durance vile, 
until the acceptance should have been ratified in heaven. He slept there a 
portion of three days in his tomb. It was declared that the ratification was to 
be this: the surety was to go his way as soon as ever his suretyship 
engagements had been fulfilled. Now let your minds picture the buried Jesus. He 
is in the sepulchre. &lsquo;Tis true he has paid all the debt, but the receipt 
is not yet given; he slumbers in that narrow tomb. Fastened in with a seal upon 
a giant stone, he sleeps still in his grave; not yet has the acceptance been 
given from God; the angels have not yet come from heaven to say, &ldquo;The 
deed is done, God has accepted thy sacrifice.&rdquo; Now is the crisis of this 
world; it hangs trembling in the balance. Will God accept the ransom, or will 
he not?</p> 
<p>We shall see. An angel comes from heaven with exceeding brightness; he 
rolls away the stone; and forth comes the captive, with no manacles upon his 
hands, with the grave clothes left behind him; free, never more to suffer, 
never more to die. Now,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If Jesus had not paid the debt,<br>
 He ne&rsquo;er had been at 
freedom set.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If God had not accepted his sacrifice, he would have been in his tomb at 
this moment; he never would have risen from his grave. But his resurrection was 
a pledge of God&rsquo;s accepting him. He said, &ldquo;I have had a claim upon 
thee to this hour; that claim is paid now; go thy way.&rdquo; And death gave up 
his royal captive, the stone was rolled into the garden, and the conqueror came 
forth, leading captivity captive.</p> 
<p>And, moreover, God gave a second proof of acceptance; for he took his only 
begotten Son to heaven, and set him at his right hand, far above all 
principalities and powers; and therein he meant to say to him, &ldquo;Sit upon 
the throne, for thou hast done the mighty deed; all thy works and all thy 
miseries are accepted as the ransom of men.&rdquo; O my beloved, think what a 
grand sight it must have been when Christ ascended into glory; what a noble 
certificate it must have been of his Father&rsquo;s acceptance of him! Do you 
not think you see the scene on earth? It is very simple. A few disciples are 
standing upon a hill, and Christ mounts into the air in slow and solemn 
movement, as if an angel sped his way by gentle degrees, like mist or 
exhalation from the lake into the skies. Can you imagine what is going on up 
yonder? Can you for a moment conceive how, when the mighty conqueror entered 
the gates of heaven, the angels met him,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;They brought his chariot from on high,<br>
 To bear him to his 
throne;<br>
 Clapp&rsquo;d their triumphant wings, and cried,</p> 
<p>&lsquo;The glorious work is done&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Can you think how loud were the plaudits when he entered the gates of 
heaven? Can you conceive how they pressed on one another, to behold how he came 
conquering and red from the fight? Do you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all 
the saints redeemed, come to behold the Saviour and the Lord? They had desired 
to see him, and now their eyes behold him in flesh and blood, the conqueror 
over death and hell! Do you think you see him, with hell at his chariot- 
wheels, with death dragged as a captive through the royal streets of heaven? 
Oh, what a spectacle was there that day! No Roman warrior ever had such a 
triumph; none ever saw such a majestic sight. The pomp of a whole universe, the 
royalty of entire creation, cherubim and seraphim and all powers create, did 
swell the show; and God himself, the Everlasting One, crowned all, when he 
pressed his Son to his bosom, and said, &ldquo;Well done, well done; thou hast 
finished the work which I gave thee to do. Rest here for ever, mine accepted 
one.&rdquo; Ah, but he never would have had that triumph, if he had not paid 
all the debt. Unless his Father had accepted the ransom-price, the ransomer had 
never been so honoured; but because it was accepted, therefore did he so 
triumph. So far, then, concerning the ransom.</p> 
<p>II. And now, by the help of God&rsquo;s Spirit, let me address myself to 
THE EFFECT OF THE RANSOM; being justified&mdash;&rdquo;justified freely by his 
grace through the redemption.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Now, what is the meaning of justification? Divines will puzzle you, if you 
ask them. I must try the best I can to make justification plain and simple, 
even to the comprehension of a child. There is not such a thing as 
justification to be had on earth for mortal men, except in one way. 
Justification, you know, is a forensic term; it is employed always in a legal 
sense. A prisoner is brought to the bar of justice to be tried. There is only 
one way whereby that prisoner can be justified; that is, he must be found not 
guilty; and if he is found not guilty, then he is justified&mdash;that is, he 
is proved to be a just man. If you find that man guilty, you cannot justify 
him. The Queen may pardon him, but she cannot justify him. The deed is not a 
justifiable one, if he were guilty concerning it; and he cannot be justified on 
account of it. He may be pardoned; but not royalty itself can ever wash that 
man&rsquo;s character. He is as much a real criminal when he is pardoned as 
before. There is no means among men of justifying a man of an accusation which 
is laid against him, except by his being proved not guilty.</p> 
<p>Now, the wonder of wonders is, that we are proved guilty, and yet we are 
justified: the verdict has been brought in against us, guilty; and yet, 
notwithstanding, we are justified. Can any earthly tribunal do that? No; it 
remained for the ransom of Christ to effect that which is an impossibility to 
any tribunal upon earth. We are all guilty.</p> 
<p>Read the 23rd verse, immediately preceding the text&mdash;&rdquo; For all 
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&rdquo; There the verdict of 
guilty is brought in, and yet we are immediately afterwards said to be 
justified freely by his grace.</p> 
<p>Now, allow me to explain the way whereby God justifies a sinner. I am about 
to suppose an impossible case. A prisoner has been tried, and condemned to 
death. He is a guilty man; he cannot be justified, because he is guilty. But 
now, suppose for a moment that such a thing as this could happen&mdash;that 
some second party could be introduced, who could take all that man&rsquo;s 
guilt upon himself, who could change places with that man, and by some 
mysterious process, which of course is impossible with men, become that man; or 
take that man&rsquo;s character upon himself; he, the righteous man, putting 
the rebel in his place, and making the rebel a righteous man. We cannot do that 
in our courts. If I were to go before a judge, and he should agree that I 
should be committed for a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, instead of some wretch who 
was condemned yesterday to a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, I could not take his 
guilt. I might take his punishment, but not his guilt. Now, what flesh and 
blood cannot do, that Jesus Christ by his redemption did. Here I stand, the 
sinner. I mention myself as the representative of you all. I am condemned to 
die. God says, &ldquo;I will condemn that man; I must, I will&mdash;I will 
punish him.&rdquo; Christ comes in, puts me aside, and stands himself in my 
stead. When the plea is demanded, Christ says, &ldquo;Guilty;&rdquo; takes my 
guilt to be his own guilt. When the punishment is to be executed, forth comes 
Christ. &ldquo;Punish me,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I have put my righteousness on 
that man, and I have taken that man&rsquo;s sins on me. Father, punish me, and 
consider that man to have been me. Let him reign in heaven; let me suffer 
misery. Let me endure his curse, and let him receive my blessing.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This marvellous doctrine of the changing of places of Christ with poor 
sinners, is a doctrine of revelation, for it never could have been conceived by 
nature. Let me, lest I should have made a mistake, explain myself again. The 
way whereby God saves a sinner is not, as some say, by passing over the 
penalty. No; the penalty has been all paid. It is the putting of another person 
in the rebel&rsquo;s place. The rebel must die; God says he must. Christ says, 
&ldquo;I will be substitute for the rebel. The rebel shall take my place; I 
will take his.&rdquo; God consents to it. No earthly monarch could have power 
to consent to such a change. But the God of heaven had a right to do as he 
pleased. In his infinite mercy he consented to the arrangement. &rdquo; Son of 
my love,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must stand in the sinner&rsquo;s place; you 
must suffer what he ought to have suffered; you must be accounted guilty, just 
as he was accounted guilty; and then I will look upon the sinner in another 
light. I will look at him as if he were Christ; I will accept him as if he were 
my only- begotten Son, full of grace and truth. I will give him a crown in 
heaven, and I will take him to my heart for ever and ever.&rdquo; This is the 
way we are saved, &ldquo;Being justified freely by his grace, through the 
redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And now, let me further go on to explain some of the characteristics of 
this justification. As soon as a repenting sinner is justified, remember, he is 
justified for all his sins. Here stands a man all guilty. The moment he 
believes in Christ, his pardon at once he receives, and his sins are no longer 
his; they are cast into the depths of the sea. They were laid upon the 
shoulders of Christ, and they are gone. The man stands a guiltless man in the 
sight of God, accepted in the beloved. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; say you, &ldquo;do 
you mean that literally?&rdquo; Yes, I do, That is the doctrine of 
justification by faith. Man ceases to be regarded by divine justice as a guilty 
being; the moment he believes on Christ his guilt is all taken away. But I am 
going a step further. The moment the man believes in Christ, he ceases to be 
guilty in God&rsquo;s esteem; but what is more, he becomes righteous, he 
becomes meritorious; for, in the moment when Christ takes his sins he takes 
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness; so that, when God looks upon the sinner who but 
an hour ago was dead in sins, he looks upon him with as much love and affection 
as he ever looked upon his Son. He himself has said it&mdash;&rdquo;As the 
Father loved me, so have I loved you.&rdquo; He loves us as much as his Father 
loved him. Can you believe such a doctrine as that? Does it not pass all 
thought? Well, it is a doctrine of the Holy Spirit; the doctrine whereby we 
must hope to be saved. Can I to any unenlightened person illustrate this 
thought better? I will give him the parable we have given to us in the 
prophets&mdash;the parable of Joshua the high-priest. Joshua comes in, clothed 
in filthy garments; those filthy garments representing his sins. Take away the 
filthy garments; that is pardon. Put a mitre on his head; clothe him in royal 
raiment; make him rich and fair; that is justification. But where do these 
garments come from? and where do those rags go to? Why, the rags that Joshua 
had on go to Christ, and the garments put on Joshua are the garments that 
Christ wore. The sinner and Christ do just what Jonathan and David did. 
Jonathan put his robes on David, David gave Jonathan his garments; so Christ 
takes our sins, we take Christ&rsquo;s righteousness; and it is by a glorious 
substitution and interchange of places that sinners go free and are justified 
by his grace.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;no one is justified like that, till he 
dies.&rdquo; Believe me, he is.<br>
 &ldquo;The moment a sinner believes,<br>
 
And trusts in his crucified God,<br>
 His pardon at once he receives;<br>
 
Salvation in full, through his blood.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If that young man over there has really believed in Christ this morning, 
realizing by a spiritual experience what I have attempted to describe, he is as 
much justified in God&rsquo;s sight now as he will be when he stands before the 
throne. Not the glorified spirits above are more acceptable to God than the 
poor man below, who is once justified by grace. It is a perfect washing, it is 
perfect pardon, perfect imputation; we are fully, freely, and wholly accepted, 
through Christ our Lord. Just one more word here, and then I will leave this 
matter of justification.</p> 
<p>Those who are once justified are justified irreversibly. As soon as a 
sinner takes Christ&rsquo;s place, and Christ takes the sinner&rsquo;s place, 
there is no fear of a second change. If Christ has once paid the debt, the debt 
is paid, and it will never be asked for again; if you are pardoned, you are 
pardoned once for ever. God does not give man a free pardon under his own 
sign-manual, and then afterwards retract it and punish man: that be far from 
God so to do. He says, &ldquo;I have punished Christ; you may go free.&rdquo; 
And after that, we may &ldquo;rejoice in hope of the glory of God,&rdquo; that 
&ldquo;being justified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus 
Christ.&rdquo; And now I hear one cry, &ldquo;That is an extraordinary 
doctrine.&rdquo; Well, so some may think; but let me say to you, it is a 
doctrine professed by all protestant churches, though they may not preach it. 
It is the doctrine of the Church of England, it is the doctrine of Luther, it 
is the doctrine of the Presbyterian church; it is professedly the doctrine of 
all Christian churches; and if it seems strange in your ears, it is because 
your ears are estranged, and not because the doctrine is a strange one. It is 
the doctrine of holy writ, that none can condemn whom God justifies, and that 
none can accuse those for whom Christ hath died; for they are totally free from 
sin. So that, as one of the prophets has it, God sees no sin in Jacob nor 
iniquity in Israel. In the moment they believe, their sins being imputed to 
Christ, they cease to be theirs, and Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed to 
them and accounted theirs, so that they are accepted.</p> 
<p>III. And now I close up with the third point, upon which I shall be brief, 
and I hope very earnest: THE MANNER OF GIVING THIS JUSTIFICATION. John Bunyan 
would have it, that there are some whose mouths are set a watering for this 
great gift of justification. Are there not some here who are saying, &ldquo;Oh! 
if I could be justified! But, Sir, can I be justified? I have been a drunkard, 
I have been a swearer, I have been everything that is vile. Can I be justified? 
Will Christ take my black sins, and am I to take his white robes? Yes, poor 
soul, if thou desirest it; if God has made thee willing, if thou dost confess 
thy sins, Christ is willing to take thy rags, and give thee his righteousness, 
to be thine for ever.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Well, but how is it to be obtained?&rdquo; says one &ldquo;must I be 
a holy man for many years, and then get it?&rdquo; Listen! &ldquo;Freely by his 
grace;&rdquo; &ldquo;freely,&rdquo; because there is no price to be paid for 
it; &ldquo;By his grace,&rdquo; because it is not of our deservings. 
&ldquo;But, O Sir, I have been praying, and I do not think God will forgive me, 
unless I do something to deserve it.&rdquo; I tell you, Sir, if you bring in 
any of your deservings, you shall never have it. God gives away his 
justification freely; if you bring anything to pay for it, he will throw it in 
your face, and will not give his justification to you. He gives it away freely. 
Old Rowland Hill once went preaching at a fair; he noticed the chapmen selling 
their wares by auction; so Rowland said, &ldquo;I am going to hold an auction 
too, to sell wine and milk, without money and without price. My friends over 
there,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;find a great difficulty to get you up to their 
price; my difficulty is to bring you down to mine.&rdquo; So it is with men. If 
I could preach justification to be bought by you at a sovereign a piece, who 
would go out of the place without being justified? If I could preach 
justification to you by walking a hundred miles, would we not be pilgrims 
tomorrow morning, every one of us? If I were to preach justification which 
would consist in whippings and torture, there are very few here who would not 
whip themselves, and that severely too. But when it is freely, freely, freely, 
men turn away. &ldquo;What! am I to have it for nothing at all, without doing 
anything?&rdquo; Yes, Sir, you are to have it for nothing, or else not at all; 
it is &ldquo;freely.&rdquo; &ldquo;But may I not go to Christ, lay some claim 
to his mercy, and say, Lord, justify me because I am not so bad as 
others?&rdquo; It will not do, Sir, because it is &ldquo;by his grace.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;But may I not indulge a hope, because I go to church twice a day?&rdquo; 
No, Sir; it is &ldquo;by his grace.&rdquo; &ldquo;But may I not offer this 
plea, I mean to be better?&rdquo; No, sir; it is &ldquo;by his grace.&rdquo; 
You insult God by bringing your counterfeit coin to pay for his treasures. Oh! 
what poor ideas men have of the value of Christ&rsquo;s gospel, if they think 
they can buy it! God will not have your rusty farthings to buy heaven with. A 
rich man once, when he was dying, had a notion that he could buy a place in 
heaven by building a row of almshouses. A good man stood by his bed-side, and 
said, &ldquo;How much more are you going to leave?&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty 
thousand pounds.&rdquo; Said he &ldquo;That would not buy enough for your foot 
to stand on in heaven; for the streets are made of gold there, and therefore of 
what value can your gold be, it would be accounted nothing of, when the very 
streets are paved with it?&rdquo; Nay, friends, we cannot buy heaven with gold 
nor good works, nor prayers, nor anything in the world. But how is it to be 
got? Why it is to be got for asking only. As many of us as know ourselves to be 
sinners may have Christ for asking for him. Do you know that you want Christ? 
You may have Christ! &ldquo;Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water 
of life freely.&rdquo; But if you cleave to your own notions, and say, 
&ldquo;No, Sir, I mean to do a great many good things, and then I will believe 
in Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;Sir, you will be damned if you hold by such delusions. 
I earnestly warn you. You cannot be saved so. &ldquo;Well, but are we not to do 
good works?&rdquo; Certainly you are; but you are not to trust in them. You 
must trust in Christ wholly, and then do good works afterwards. 
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;I think if I were to do a few good works, 
it would be a little recommendation when I came.&rdquo; It would not, sir; they 
would be no recommendation at all. Let a beggar come to your house in white kid 
gloves, and say he is very badly off, and wants some charity; would the white 
kid gloves recommend him to your charity? Would a good new hat that he has been 
buying this morning recommend him to your charity? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; you would 
say, &ldquo;you are a miserable impostor; you do not want anything, and you 
shall not have anything either! Out with you!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The best livery for a beggar is rags, and the best livery for a sinner to 
go to Christ in, is for him to go just as he is, with nothing but sin about 
him. &ldquo;But no;&rdquo; say you, &ldquo;I must be a little better, and then 
I think Christ will save me!&rdquo; You cannot get any better, try as long as 
you please. And besides &mdash;to use a paradox&mdash;if you were to get 
better, you would be all the worse; for the worse you are, the better to come 
to Christ. If you are all unholy come to Christ; if you feel your sin, and 
renounce it, come to Christ; though you have been the most debased and 
abandoned soul, come to Christ; if you feel yourself to have nothing about you 
that can recommend you, come to Christ.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Venture on him, venture wholly;<br>
 Let no other trust 
intrude.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I do not say this to urge any man to continue in sin. God forbid! If you 
continue in sin, you must not come to Christ; you cannot; your sins will hamper 
you. You cannot be chained to your galley- oar&mdash;the oar of your 
sins&mdash;yet come to Christ, and be a free man. No, sir, it is repentance; it 
is the immediate leaving off the sin. But mark thee, neither by repentance, nor 
by leaving off thy sin, can save thee. It is Christ, Christ, 
Christ&mdash;Christ only.</p> 
<p>But I know you will go away, many of you, and try to build up your own 
Babel-tower, to get to heaven. Some of you will go one way to work, and some 
another. You will go the ceremony way: you will lay the foundation of the 
structure with infant baptism, build confirmation on it, and the Lord&rsquo;s 
supper. &ldquo;I shall go to heaven,&rdquo; you say; &ldquo;Do not I keep Good 
Friday and Christmas-day? I am a better man than those dissenters. I am a most 
extraordinary man. Do I not say more prayers than any one?&rdquo; You will be a 
long while going up that treadmill, before you get an inch higher. That is not 
the way to get to the stars. One says, &ldquo;I will go and study the Bible, 
and believe right doctrine; and I have no doubt that by believing right 
doctrine I shall be saved.&rdquo; Indeed you will not! You can be no more saved 
by believing right doctrine than you can by doing right actions. 
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;I like that; I shall go and believe 
in Christ, and live as I like.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Indeed you will not! For if you believe in Christ he will not let you live 
as your flesh liketh; by his Spirit he will constrain you to mortify its 
affections and lusts. If he gives you the grace to make you believe, he will 
give you the grace to live a holy life afterwards. If he gives you faith, he 
gives you good works after- wards. You cannot believe in Christ, unless you 
renounce every fault, and resolve to serve him with full purpose of heart. 
Methinks at last I hear a sinner say, &ldquo;Is that the only door? And may I 
venture through it? Then I will. But I do not quite understand you; I am 
something like poor Tiff, in that remarkable book &lsquo;Dred.&rsquo; They talk 
a great deal about a door, but I cannot see the door; they talk a great deal 
about the way, but I cannot see the way. For if poor Tiff could see the way, he 
would take these children away by it. They talk about fighting, but I do not 
see any one to fight, or else I would fight.&rdquo; Let me explain it then. I 
find in the Bible, &ldquo;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all 
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&rdquo; What 
have you to do, but to believe this and trust in him? You will never be 
disappointed with such a faith as that. Let me give you over again an 
illustration I have given hundreds of times, but I cannot find another so good, 
so I must give it again. Faith is something like this. There is a story told of 
a captain of a man-of-war, whose son&mdash;a young lad&mdash;was very fond of 
running up the rigging of the ship; and one time, running after a monkey, he 
ran up the mast, till at last he got on to the maintruck. Now, the maintruck, 
you are aware, is like a large round table put on to the mast, so that when the 
boy was on the maintruck there was plenty of room for him; but the difficulty 
was&mdash;to use the best explanation I can&mdash;that he could not reach the 
mast that was under the table; he was not tall enough to get down from this 
maintruck, reach the mast, and so descend. There he was on the maintruck; he 
managed to get up there, somehow or other, but down he never could get. His 
father saw that, and he looked up in horror; what was he to do? In a few 
moments his son would fall down, and be dashed to pieces! He was clinging to 
the main-truck with all his might, but in a little time he would fall down on 
the deck, and there he would be a mangled corpse. The captain called for a 
speaking trumpet; he put it to his mouth, and shouted, &ldquo;Boy, the next 
time the ship lurches, throw yourself into the sea.&rdquo; It was, in truth, 
his only way of escape; he might be picked up out of the sea, but he could not 
be rescued if he fell on the deck. The poor boy looked down on the sea; it was 
a long way; he could not bear the idea of throwing himself into the roaring 
current beneath him; he thought it looked angry and dangerous. How could he 
cast himself down into it? So he clung to the main-truck with all his might, 
though there was no doubt that he must soon let go and perish. The father 
called for a gun, and pointing it up at him, said, &ldquo;Boy, the next time 
the ship lurches, throw yourself into the sea, or I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo; 
He knew his father would keep his word; the ship lurched on one side, over went 
the boy splash into the sea, and out went brawny arms after him; the sailors 
rescued him, and brought him on deck.</p> 
<p>Now, we, like the boy, are in a position of extra-ordinary danger, by 
nature, which neither you nor I can possibly escape of ourselves. 
Unfortunately, we have got some good works of our own, like that maintruck, and 
we cling to them so fondly, that we never will give them up. Christ knows that 
unless we do give them up, we shall be dashed to pieces at the last, for that 
rotten trust must ruin us. He, therefore, says, &ldquo;Sinner, let go thine own 
trust, and drop into the sea of my love.&rdquo; We look down, and say, 
&ldquo;Can I be saved by trusting in God? He looks as if he were angry with me, 
and I could not trust him.&rdquo; Ah, will not mercy&rsquo;s tender cry 
persuade you?&mdash;&rdquo;He that believeth shall be saved.&rdquo; Must the 
weapon of destruction be pointed directly at you? Must you hear the dreadful 
threat&mdash;&rdquo;He that believeth not shall be damned?&rdquo; It is with 
you now as with that boy&mdash;your position is one of imminent peril in 
itself, and your slighting the Father&rsquo;s counsel is a matter of more 
terrible alarm, it makes peril more perilous. You must do it, or else you 
perish! Let go your hold! That is faith when the poor sinner lets go his hold, 
drops down, and so is saved; and the very thing which looks as if it would 
destroy him, is the means of his being saved. Oh! believe on Christ, poor 
sinners; believe on Christ. Ye who know your guilt and misery come, cast 
yourselves upon him; come, and trust my Master, and as he lives, before whom I 
stand, you shall never trust him in vain; but you shall find yourselves 
forgiven, and go your way rejoicing in Christ Jesus.</p>
