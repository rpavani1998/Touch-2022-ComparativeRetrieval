<p>I rarely see a movie more than once.&nbsp; The truth is, I rarely see a 
movie once, because a movie doesn&rsquo;t usually hold my attention and I 
either fall asleep or move on to something else.&nbsp; But there is one movie I 
have seen more times than I can count:&nbsp; &ldquo;When We Were Kings,&rdquo; 
a documentary directed byLeon Gast, subtitled &ldquo;The untold story of the 
Rumble in the Jungle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;It won the 1996 Academy Award for Best 
Documentary Feature.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worth seeing numerous times because of 
the quality of the production and direction; but mostly it is also worth seeing 
because of the story.&nbsp;<em></em> It is about one of the greatest sport 
events &ndash; perhaps events of any kind &ndash; in contemporary history: The 
Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman fight that took place in Zaire (now Democratic 
Republic of the Congo) in October 1974, known as &ldquo;The Rumble in the 
Jungle.&rdquo;&nbsp; As everyone else, I&rsquo;ve taken my share of rights to 
the jaw in one fashion or another in the course of my life.&nbsp; Whenever it 
gets to me, I watch this movie.&nbsp; As we end one year and begin the next, 
especially as we end this particular year and begin 2009 with gut level 
instincts of fear and hope, dismay and pride, watching this movie could teach 
an important lesson.&nbsp; It may be the best parable we can turn to right now.
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>The Rumble In The Jungle Is All About How To Overcome Fear &ndash; 
<em>Legitimate &amp; Totally Justified Fear: Not Unlike The American Public Has 
Today.</em></strong></p> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t normally associate fear with Muhammad Ali, but fear 
dominated him as he prepared for the fight with George Foreman.&nbsp; And there 
was good reason.&nbsp; Despite his friendly and gentle personality today, 
George Foreman was a ferocious boxer.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t be rational and 
not fear him &ndash; and Ali, in addition to being bombastic was also very 
rational and realistic about what he was to face in the ring &ndash;much like 
today, when everyone who is rational and realistic fears the prospect of how 
the economy may deal them a disabling blow.&nbsp; What Ali did against Foreman 
may be a role model for how Americans can deal with the economy.&nbsp; Read on 
&hellip;.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Ali&rsquo;s fear was evident far in advance of the fight itself.&nbsp; 
Norman Mailer described Ali at an early press conference to promote the fight 
this way:</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;I think Ali was scared.&nbsp; I think he was scared even then [at 
the press conference].&nbsp; And he knew he was going to be very scared as 
he&rsquo;d get closer to the fight.&nbsp; With his ego he could keep telling 
himself that he would dominate Foreman.&nbsp; That he would beat him; that he 
would dance; that he would make a fool of him; that he would show him superior 
boxing; that Foreman would never lay a glove on him.&nbsp; But in fact, in his 
sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he did not do 
nearly as well against two boxers, particularly Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, 
whom Foreman had demolished.&nbsp; He had an overpowering intensity when he 
punched.&nbsp; Foreman won his championship by knocking Joe Frazier out and 
knocked him down something like seven times.&nbsp; Then he destroyed Ken Norton 
in two rounds.&nbsp; The word &lsquo;murderous&rsquo; does not quite 
apply.&nbsp; Foreman was awesome.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>And here&rsquo;s what George Plimpton said, describing his visit to the 
Presidential Palace facility where the boxers trained while in Africa:</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;He [Foreman] seemed incredible.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d seen him fight 
before.&nbsp; I saw him destroy Frazier.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen 
destruction like that.&nbsp; And the thing that I&rsquo;ve always remembered 
was that a beaten fighter, even a man as big and powerful as Frazier &ndash; 
and he was very much favored to win that fight &ndash; suddenly becomes about 
the size of a pygmy.&nbsp; They just diminish in size.&nbsp; And Foreman 
suddenly became this gigantic figure.&nbsp; And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler, 
tiny by comparison with Foreman; and Saddler would hang onto the heavy bag, and 
when Foreman would hit this bag, Saddler would literally be picked off his 
feet.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 The &ldquo;heavy bag&rdquo; is the name for that training device 
everyone has seen in boxing movies or at gyms &ndash; it is the big leather bag 
that hangs from the ceiling, a cylinder that represents a crude and 
over-simplified form of a human torso.&nbsp; This is the way Mailer described 
Foreman at the heavy bag &ndash; and how Ali dealt with it:</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Foreman hitting the heavy bag is one of the more prodigious sights 
I&rsquo;ve had in my life.&nbsp; It seems to me that of all the people 
I&rsquo;ve seen hitting heavy bags, including Sonny Liston, no one hit it the 
way Foreman did.&nbsp; At the end of 15 minutes of pounding the heavy bag, 
there&rsquo;d be a hole in the heavy bag &ndash; not a hole but a huge dent the 
size of half a small watermelon in that tremendous heavy bag &ndash; and 
Foreman used the biggest heavy bag around.&nbsp; What would be interesting is 
that Ali, who would train after Foreman, would often pass by this large hall 
where training took place, and he never looked at Foreman hitting the heavy 
bag.&nbsp; He just walked right by as if Foreman did not exist.&nbsp; And it 
was significant because if you were going to fight the man you didn&rsquo;t 
want to see him hitting that heavy bag.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The build-up before the fight actually took much longer than expected 
because Foreman suffered an injury during training, and the fight had to be 
postponed.&nbsp; The fighters had already been in Zaire for several weeks, 
training and promoting the fight, and they decided that rather than cancel the 
fight, or substitute another boxer for Foreman, they would simply push the date 
out a few weeks.&nbsp; That gave Ali more time to endear himself to the 
citizens of Zaire, who already adored him anyhow.&nbsp; Foreman never 
understood it.&nbsp; He could not fathom how Ali would be loved by so many 
while he had virtually no fans.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blacker than he 
is,&rdquo; Foreman said, referring to his actual skin color.&nbsp; He just did 
not understand that Ali was a hero because of his personality and his 
resistance to being drafted into the US Army in 1967, for which he was 
suspended from boxing for three-and-a-half years.&nbsp; He was more than a 
global figure &ndash; he was an absolute hero to many, including those in Zaire.
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>So Ali used the delay before the fight to continue his training and to 
reach out to the people of Zaire, encouraging them whenever they saw him to 
yell: &ldquo;Boomiyay Ali.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chant meant &ldquo;kill 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Ali ran on the Zaire roads, engaged with the citizens 
during the day, and whenever he had the opportunity, he would encourage the 
people to chant &ldquo;Boomiyay Ali&rdquo; over and over again.&nbsp; And they 
always responded with a loud chorus of &ldquo;Boomiyay Ali&rdquo; repeated over 
and over.&nbsp; He had a plan: he would use the chanting of the crowd on fight 
night to cheer him on and, perhaps, to strike a blow to Foreman&rsquo;s 
morale.&nbsp; But he had another plan too &ndash; and it was secret.&nbsp; It 
was called &ldquo;rope-a-dope.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Ali told his trainer, the legendary Angelo Dundee, that he had a secret 
plan, as he also told his fans.&nbsp; But he did not describe it, and virtually 
everyone dismissed the claim.&nbsp; A few minutes before the fight actually 
began, in his dressing room, among his most intimate supporters, Ali reiterated 
his intention of using a secret plan.&nbsp; He saw the looks on the faces of 
these people who were so close to him, and he saw what was obvious:&nbsp; they 
were seriously concerned about what Foreman would do to him.&nbsp; He tried to 
rally his supporters, using bombast &ndash; his unique form of braggadocio; his 
equivalent of a lion roaring at prey &ndash; to energize them.&nbsp; To erase 
their fears.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>But his own fear was clearly visible on his face when he stepped into the 
ring.&nbsp; There are many iconic pictures of Ali, but the look on his face, as 
seen in the movie, is powerful.&nbsp; The fear is obvious.&nbsp; It is 
palpable.&nbsp; It is scary for the viewer to see.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>In fact, his plan was the exact opposite of what he said he would do.&nbsp; 
He said he would dance &ndash; he would &ldquo;dance and dance and dance&rdquo; 
he said.&nbsp; He would use his incredible legs to avoid Foreman&rsquo;s 
ferocious punches.&nbsp; But that isn&rsquo;t what he did at all.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>In the first round, Ali disoriented Foreman by using right hand leads, 
which is an aberrant tactic.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t do much damage to 
Foreman.&nbsp; And that wasn&rsquo;t his &ldquo;secret plan&rdquo; 
anyhow.&nbsp; That became obvious in the second round when Ali did what nobody, 
even his corner, expected.&nbsp; He went against the ropes.&nbsp; He let 
Foreman hit him.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Ali continued to let Foreman hit him round after round, staying against the 
ropes.&nbsp; He effectively defended himself from getting hurt by the 
punches.&nbsp; At the same time, he often threw his own body against 
Foreman&rsquo;s, making Foreman bear his weight.&nbsp; On some occasions, 
he&rsquo;d throw quick shots straight to Foreman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d 
taunt Foreman with phrases like: &ldquo;Is that the best you can give me 
George?&rdquo;&nbsp; All in the massive heat of the open stadium filled with 
Ali fans who would begin to chant &ldquo;Boomiyay Ali&rdquo; whenever Ali gave 
them the signal.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Ali stayed against the ropes until the eighth round.&nbsp; By that time 
Foreman, younger than Ali, had punched himself out.&nbsp; And his face was 
puffed-up by the relatively few, but sharp, shots that were the result of 
Ali&rsquo;s singular offensive tactic.&nbsp; And he fell unconscious after Ali 
landed a left hook that had the effect of lifting Foreman&rsquo;s head so that 
it would be in perfect position to be smashed by Ali&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; The 
fight was over.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Get Ready For An Economic Version Of Rope-A-Dope</strong></p> 
<p>I applaud all the efforts, individually, institutionally and by governments 
(even governments acting cooperatively one with another) to mitigate the damage 
of the economic crisis.&nbsp; But the reality is that at least for a while that 
is all that is going to be done:&nbsp;<em>mitigate the damage.</em> There will 
be damage.&nbsp; And even if not as deep and long-lasting as a worse case 
scenario, it will be serious.&nbsp; During that period of time, it may be the 
most realistic approach to emulate Ali&rsquo;s rope-a-dope strategy.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Whatever we are going through &ndash; I think that ultimately it will be 
called something other than a &ldquo;recession&rdquo; &ndash; I think that we 
have to look at it realistically.&nbsp; Just maybe we ought to see it the same 
way Ali saw Foreman:&nbsp; a formidable opponent that should be feared.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;re going to be in the ring for a while.&nbsp; Maybe the best strategy 
is to put up defenses (Obama&rsquo;s economic stimulus plan?) and keep the 
opponent &ndash; in this case, the economy &ndash; from hurting you too hard 
and too often.&nbsp; But expect to be hurt nevertheless.&nbsp; Every once in a 
while, take some step to be positioned for when the time comes that victory can 
be obtained (in the case of the economy, could this be an investment in the 
nation&rsquo;s infrastructure, education, etc.?).&nbsp; After some period of 
time, the opponent will punch itself out.&nbsp; New opportunities for victory 
will arise.&nbsp; The positioning built over time can be fully exploited at 
that time.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>How long will this fight with the economy last?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t 
matter.&nbsp; If it lasts only one round, the strategy can make sense.&nbsp; 
Sometimes life is rope-a-dope.&nbsp; This may, at least in part, be one of 
those times.&nbsp; If so, go get &ldquo;When We Were Kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
turn the volume up &ndash; the movie has a great soundtrack.</p>

<p>Good post poretz. As Ali once said &ldquo;I hated every minute of training, 
but I said, &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life 
as a champion.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>Good metaphor Doug. Ali is a bigger than life character whose example is 
every bit as potent today as it was in his fighting prime. He liked to talk the 
talk but he also walked the walk by being what we thought he was. If only our 
leaders today were who we would like them to be.</p> </li>
