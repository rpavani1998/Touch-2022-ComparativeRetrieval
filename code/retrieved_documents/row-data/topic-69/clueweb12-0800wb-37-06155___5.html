<b>Muhammad Ali vs. Cleveland 
Williams at the Astrodome, Houston, 1966</b><br>
<br>
<b>Neil Leifer:</b> 
&quot;I think this is the best picture I ever made. It's the only picture of 
mine that I have in my home. I could go on for a long time about the technical 
aspects of the shot, how I studied the Astrodome, planned the photo for weeks 
before the fight, pictured the shot in my head, rigged up the remote trigger 
that I used to get the shot from above while I was physically down at ringside 
shooting the fight &mdash; but what makes this so special to me is that it's as 
close as I've ever gotten to a perfect shot. Ali, Williams, the referee, the 
reporters, the symmetry, the drama &mdash; it's the one photograph I've taken 
where, looking back, I'd change nothing.&quot; NOTE: Leifer is visible here, 
wearing a light blue shirt and seated near the top along the left-hand side of 
the ring, with his camera resting in front of him.<br>

<p>Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s first sounds were &ldquo;Gee-Gee, Gee-Gee.&rdquo; His 
beautiful mother Odessa Clay called her son &ldquo;G-G&rdquo; for the rest of 
her life, and years later, Ali would say, &ldquo;After I won the Golden Gloves, 
I told Mama that from the very beginning, I was trying to say, &lsquo;Golden 
Gloves.&rsquo; &rdquo; So began the life of Muhammad Ali, who celebrates his 
70th birthday today.</p> 
<p>Though many know him as the greatest boxer of all time, few know that it 
was actually the theft of his bicycle at age 12 that began his boxing career. 
After the bike was stolen, Ali ran to the police station, threatening to 
&ldquo;whup whoever stole my bike.&rdquo; Joe Martin, a white Louisville, Ky., 
policeman, told him he had better learn to fight, and in his spare time, he 
took Ali under his wing and taught him the ropes. Ali won his first fight six 
weeks later. When the referee raised his arm in victory, Ali shouted the iconic 
words that would become a self-fulfilling prophecy: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be 
the greatest of all time!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But what was so incredible about Ali was all the courageous and selfless 
things he did beyond boxing. In 1975 I called Ali to talk to him about the 
campaign I was doing for Rubin &ldquo;Hurricane&rdquo; Carter, whose book 
convinced me that he was an innocent man in the slammer. Muhammad was so happy 
to hear I thought Rubin was innocent. He said, &ldquo;Absolutely, I&rsquo;m 
with you.&rdquo; Ali literally stopped doing a million things to help someone 
&mdash; a fellow fighter &mdash; get out of jail. It was so heroic, and of all 
the times we worked together, it is still my favorite memory of him. I also 
can&rsquo;t tell you how many times, when we were driving on the road, 
he&rsquo;d see a school and make me pull over. He&rsquo;d meet all 200 
schoolkids and sign 200 autographs, often with a kid on his lap. That was just 
his personality, to be so giving of his time. It seriously got to the point 
that when I saw a school, I&rsquo;d think, &ldquo;Oh my God, here we go again. 
We&rsquo;re in trouble.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>About 15 years ago, I was a juror in court in downtown Manhattan. After the 
case was over, the judge asked the jury to enter and talk to him. We go in, and 
he explains that one of the jurors was a man who changed his life. We&rsquo;re 
looking at each other, and he goes, &ldquo;The juror is George Lois.&rdquo; 
Everyone is looking at me, and I&rsquo;m looking at him like he&rsquo;s crazy. 
He told me he was a student at Columbia University in the &rsquo;60s, when 
there were furious debates about Vietnam and draft dodgers, and how that 1968
<em>Esquire</em> cover of Ali as St. Sebastian solidified the argument for 
Ali&rsquo;s decision to not participate in the draft. The judge said it changed 
Columbia University students&rsquo; understanding and point of view about the 
war. I remember that because it speaks to the influence of Ali. From a 
narcissistic self-promoter who eventually became a man of enduring spirituality 
through a journey of formidable tests, Ali emerged as a true superhero in the 
annals of American history and a worldwide ambassador of courage and 
conviction. A boxing legend who courageously spoke up for black men and civil 
rights throughout his life! Ali, above all, is the sweetest, nicest person 
I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life. And on his glorious 70th birthday, I am 
privileged to salute him, with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Extremely informative article and a fitting tribute to the boxing-legend on 
his 70th birthday.<br>
 The personal memories of the writer only heighten the 
authenticity and lends interest plus inspiration to this write-up.<br>
 The 
real childhood incident of the man who remains an all-time-great,is pretty much 
original and inspiring.</p> 
<p>On the whole, A GOOD READ!</p> 
<p>Thanks.<br>
