<h2>The <b>IISOH</b> is seeking $1 million (one million Dollars)<br>
 from a 
benefactor in order to establish<br>
 an endowment for the sport of <br>
<b>
BOXING</b></h2> <br>
<b>This is a unique naming opportunity for a benefactor to 
have a perpetual identification with the sport of<b>BOXING</b>. <br>
 The donor 
may name the endowment in honor of -- or in memory of -- a family member or 
friend, teacher, coach -- or anyone who has been a significant force in their 
life.<br>
 The name of the endowment would be permanent -- <br>
 subject to the 
approval of the IISOH Board of Directors.</b> <br>

<p> </p> 
<h3> For more details about the endowment program, please click here</h3> <br>

<p> </p> <b>The endowment is permanently funded because the entire one million 
Dollar donation<br>
 is placed into a trust fund where the principal is never 
used.</b> <br>
 These funds are then invested by the Institute so that only the 
quarterly earned interest is used<br>
 for the development of the <b>BOXING</b> 
collections in both the Library and Museum.<br>
The fund will grow over the 
years as additional donations are added through additional fund-raising events 
and public donations. <br>

 Boxing is an international sport that dates to the ancient 
Olympic Games numerous ancient civilizations.<br>
 We seek everything, in every 
language, in order to develop a comprehensive research collection.</b> <br>

<p> Boxing is extremely popular in many nations. It is a sport in the modern 
Olympic Games and a serious professional sport. Some famous modern boxers 
include Rocky Marciano, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali (formerly known as Cassius 
Clay), George Foreman, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson. But the sport of boxing is 
very old. The ancient Egyptians practiced boxing. It was part of the ancient 
Olympic Games from 688 BC until the Games were banished by Roman Emperor 
Theodosius Ist in 393 CE. The ancient Romans practiced a cruel form of boxing 
with hard metal studs wrapped around their hands with leather thongs -- which 
can be seen on the statue at the top of this page. The English revived the 
sport of boxing in the 1600's with the first mention in a newspaper dated 1681. 
Bare knuckles and brutality were refined with rules by John 'Jack' Broughton, 
who is considered to be the father of English boxing. He was boxing champion 
from 1729 until 1750 and introduced some refinement to the sport including a 
break for the boxers when one was knocked down. In the 1790's Daniel Medoza, 
another British boxer, introduced refined techniques to the sport which 
included fancy footwork, sparring and the use of counter punches. In 1867 the 
Marquis of Queensberry, John Sholto Douglas, introduced The Queensbury Rules 
which are still used today. These rules included such refinements as three 
minute rounds, a ban on hugging and wrestling, the famous ten second count, and 
the use of protective gloves.<br>
</p> 
<p> With a history dating back to antiquity the sport of Boxing has vast 
quantities of documentation that the IISOH would like to acquire. Please join 
us in development of this collection. Send a donation in cash or non-cash form.
