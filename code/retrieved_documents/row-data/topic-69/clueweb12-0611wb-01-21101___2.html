<h1>Rope-a-dope politics</h1> 
<p>Dr. Robert Peltier, PE</p>  Pages: 1 2 <br>
<br>

<p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain made reference to the word 
&ldquo;fight&rdquo; 25 times during his September 4 nomination acceptance 
speech. While watching McCain&rsquo;s histrionics, my mind wandered back to 
another historic fight&mdash;the &ldquo;Rumble in the Jungle.&rdquo; Muhammad 
Ali, arguably the best boxer who ever stepped into the squared circle, was 
pitted against then-World Champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, 34 years 
ago this month. It occurred to me that there are interesting parallels linking 
that famous brawl and the daily tussles of the presidential contenders.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The consensus among handicappers was that younger and undefeated Foreman 
packed the harder punch and entered the ring a heavy favorite. Foreman, the 
1968 Olympic heavyweight gold medal winner, was the world&rsquo;s top-ranked 
boxer after knocking out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in two rounds in his 
two previous bouts. Ali, an inch taller and four pounds lighter, was unorthodox 
is his footwork but was thought to be a much better technical fighter, with 
cat-like reflexes and a two-inch-longer reach.</p> 
<h2>Deadly deception</h2> 
<p>Ali took control of the pace of the fight from the bell starting the second 
round. Ali either leaned into his opponent, neutralizing Foreman from throwing 
a big right hand, or was covered up and resting against the ropes. By round 
five, Foreman was exhausted from throwing ineffective punches and from 
Ali&rsquo;s lightning-quick jabs to his head and personal taunts like, 
&ldquo;George, is that all you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo; Foreman was completely 
flummoxed by an opponent who was unwilling to stand toe-to-toe and be pounded 
into submission.</p> 
<p>By round eight Foreman&rsquo;s punches had lost much of their 
effectiveness, and all his hope rested with a lucky knockout blow that never 
found its target. An outwardly fresh and smiling Ali then left the safety of 
the ropes and started a vicious counter-attack with jabs and hooks, most 
landing squarely on Foreman&rsquo;s head. Sensing victory, Ali hit Foreman with 
a left hook that teed up his head for a straight right hand that instantly 
turned out his lights. &ldquo;The Greatest&rdquo; regained the World 
Championship, and Foreman, frustrated, retired from boxing at age 28 to become 
a minister, siring five boys all named George, and making millions selling his 
Lean Green Grilling Machine on TV.</p> 
<p>Most boxing experts consider the Rumble in the Jungle the best example of 
an older fighter using guile and a superior strategy to literally beat a 
younger and stronger fighter at his own game. Foreman later called the fight 
&ldquo;a sweaty old boxing match which I lost,&rdquo; but it was the start of 
much more than that.</p>  Pages: 1 2 <br>
