<h2> Bert Sugar was the face of boxing for a lost sport </h2>  by Rich Mancuso 
- on Mar 27th 2012 -No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>NEW YORK -You did not have to know Bert Randolph Sugar on a personal basis. 
His presence was known with the unlit cigar etched in his mouth, a fedora hat 
on his head and always a blazer and bright tie, a part of his attire. And when 
it came to the sport of boxing, you went to him for an answer. The 75-year old 
renowned author and boxing...</p> Boxing <br>

<p>NEW YORK &ndash; The line outside of the Apollo theatre in Harlem started 
assembling a little after 10 in the morning. They weren&rsquo;t on line for 
amateur night. Nor were they on line to see the next &ldquo;American 
Idol&rdquo; or to hear the next &ldquo;Voice.&rdquo; &nbsp;They gathered on a 
very unseasonably sunny and mild Tuesday...</p> Boxing <br>

<h2> Cotto Chapter Now Is Top Rank And Maybe Mayweather </h2>  by Julio

<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New York -<strong>Miguel Cotto</strong> sought redemption. It came with a 
dominating win over<strong>Antonio Margarito</strong> at Madison Square Garden 
in their second fight late Saturday night. But as the clock ticked into Sunday 
morning, hours after Cotto prevailed for the second time as WBA Junior 
Middleweight champion, the rumors were stronger that he would be seeking 
justice with promoter<strong>Bob Arum,</strong> </p>

<h2> Cotto&rsquo;s Revenge &ndash; Watching The Fight From A Party </h2>  by 
Julio Pab&oacute;n - on Dec 4th 2011 - Comments Off <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New Windsor, NY: I attended a pre-Christmas party here in upstate New York 
yesterday. Driving up I remembered that I had not asked if they were going to 
be showing the Maragarito &ndash; Cotto fight. I figured that just about 
everyone I knew, especially Boricuas were going to be watching the fight. Even 
if you were not an avid boxing fan and you learned of the last Cotto &ndash; 
Margarito fight three years ago and the controversy that ensued you would 
definitely want to watch this fight.</p>

<h2> Memories of 'Smokin&rsquo; Joe' </h2>  by Bobby Ciafardini - on Nov 8th 
2011 -Comments Off <br>

<p></p> 
<p>NEW YORK &ndash; 1971. I was a 12-year-old parochial school student at St. 
Jerome&rsquo;s when the biggest fight of the century would take place between 
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.</p> 
<p>All week long, leading up to the fight, the debate raged on with fellow 
students as to who would win. I lobbied for Ali, only because he was the better 
known fighter of the two.</p> 
<p>My classmate (Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t recall his name) was convinced 
that Frazier was the better fighter. We made a $5 bet (a lot of money at the 
time) and I had to duck my school mate for the next couple of weeks after 
Frazier put Ali on the canvas in the 15th round, leading to a unanimous 
decision.</p>

<h2> King Holds Court </h2>  by Bobby Ciafardini - on Oct 31st 2011 - Comments 
Off <br>

<p></p> 
<p>NEW YORK &ndash; This is going down as one of the most controversial years 
in recent boxing history. A very shaky decision led to suspensions by the New 
Jersey State Athletic Control Board of judges Al Bennett, Don Givens and Hilton 
Whitaker after the Paul Williams, Erislandy Lara fight.</p> 
<p>Williams was giving the decision in a fight that many thought he lost. The 
situation got worse after the Floyd Mayweather, Victor Ortiz debacle, where 
Mayweather knocked out Ortiz after a head butt. Ortiz&rsquo; hands were down 
and he was looking at referee Joe Cortez when Mayweather clocked him with a 
left, right combination. Then just over two weeks ago, Bernard Hopkins gets 
thrown to the canvas by Chad Dawson and suffers a dislocated shoulder. When 
Hopkins is unable to continue, Dawson is awarded a TKO. The WBC&rsquo;s ruling 
body reverses the decision and Hopkins regains his title.</p>

<h2> The Flash vs The Hurricane </h2>  by William Gerena-Rochet - on Oct 21st 
2011 -Comments Off <br>

<p>New York, NY &ndash; Okay boxing fans, unless you&rsquo;re hardcore, raise 
your hands if you&rsquo;ve ever heard of Nonito (The Filipino Flash) Donaire. 
What about Omar (The Hurricane) Narvaez. If your hands are in the air, 
you&rsquo;re in the minority. Aside from the fact they are relatively unknown, 
they do have one thing in common. They both come from countries that have rich 
boxing histories. Donaire, from the Philippines, is trying to follow in the 
footsteps of 32 former champions (Joma Gamboa, Gerry Penalos just to name two) 
and 13 current champions including the man many say is the best pound for pound 
fighter in the game today in Manny Pacquiao. Narvaez, from Argentina, remembers 
the day of Julio Cesar Chavez, Carlos Monzon and Carlos Baldomir.(more&hellip;)
