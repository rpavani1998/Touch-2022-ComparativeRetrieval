<p> <strong>Male Olympic boxers will compete in 10 weight classes, from light 
flyweight to super-heavyweight, while female boxers will contest three weight 
divisions (flyweight, lightweight, middleweight).</strong> </p> 
<p> The male bouts are contested over three three-minute rounds - compared to 
professional fights which last 12 rounds. Female bouts take place over four 
two-minute rounds.</p> 
<p> The fighter who knocks out their opponent or scores the most points wins. 
Boxers score one point for every punch they land with the marked part of their 
glove on their opponent&rsquo;s head or upper body. If three of the panel of 
five judges hit electronic buttons within a second of each other the boxer is 
awarded a point.</p> 
<p> Any boxer who moves more than 12 points ahead of an opponent automatically 
wins. This system differs from professional boxing where points are awarded 
based on each boxer&rsquo;s overall performance in a round, not for each 
individual successful punch.</p> 
<p> The boxer judged to have won the round (normally the fighter who lands the 
most quality shots) is given 10 points, while the loser is given nine points. 
If the fight goes to points, the winner is the one with the highest accumulated 
score (i.e. the fighter who won the most rounds) as decided by the judges.</p> 
<p> Each boxer is given a corner, labelled red or blue. This is also the 
colour of the clothing they wear to fight. All fighters must also wear 
protective headgear, a key difference from the professional bouts.</p> 
<h3> Events / disciplines </h3> 
<p> Men&rsquo;s light flyweight 49kg, men&rsquo;s flyweight 52kg , 
women&rsquo;s flyweight 51kg, men&rsquo;s bantamweight 56kg, men&rsquo;s 
lightweight 60kg, women&rsquo;s lightweight 60kg, men&rsquo;s light 
welterweight 64kg, men&rsquo;s welter weight 69kg, men&rsquo;s middleweight 75 
kg, women&rsquo;s middleweight 75kg, men&rsquo;s light heavyweight 81kg,

<p> <strong>The scoring system has its detractors, who claim that it 
discourages boxers from throwing combinations and rewards the tactic of taking 
a single shot at an opponent and then moving swiftly out of range.</strong> </p>
<p> A solid defence and good counter-attacking skills often prove fruitful in 
Olympic boxing meaning fights are often very tactical with both fighters 
waiting for the other to move forward.</p> 
<p> Often boxers who are leading a contest will slow the pace of the fight 
down by holding onto their opponents - something which is discouraged and can 
lead to a fighter being docked points.</p> 
<h3> What to say </h3> 
<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the latest Cuban 
sensation.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3> What not to say </h3> 
<p> &ldquo;Hang on, that can&rsquo;t be right. I&rsquo;m sure those two are 
women.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3> If it were a TV programme, it would be </h3> 
<p> Danny Dyer&rsquo;s Deadliest Men. A host of characters whose pint you hope 
never to spill.</p> 
<p> <strong>Boxing has featured in every Olympics since 1904, apart from the 
1912 Stockholm Games, when Swedish law banned it. This will be the first time 
in the sport&rsquo;s 108 yea history that women will compete.</strong> </p> 
<p> Many Olympic boxers have gone on to scale the heights in the professional 
sport, with Cassius Clay - later, of course, Muhammad Ali - the most notable.
</p> 
<p> Team GB are fourth in the overall medal table having won 48 medals, behind 
the old Soviet Union (51), Cuba (63) and America (109).</p> 
<h3> Jargon: </h3> 
<p> <strong>Ring apron: </strong>The canvas area outside the ropes where 
judges choose the winners of rounds and where the boxer&rsquo;s cornermen sit.
<br> <strong>Throw in the towel: </strong>The traditional way to concede 
defeat; a boxer's cornermen will throw a towel into the ring when he feels his 
charge cannot continue.<br>
<strong>Southpaw: </strong>A left-handed boxer, who 
leads with the right hand.<br>
<strong>Belt:</strong> An imaginary line around 
a boxer&rsquo;s midriff, below which his opponent is not allowed to hit.<br>

<strong>Jab:</strong> A straight, arm-length punch thrown from the 
boxer&rsquo;s leading hand.<br>
<strong>Uppercut: </strong>An upwards-thrown 
punch designed to hit an opponent&rsquo;s chin.<br>
<strong>Hook:</strong> A 
sideways-thrown punch in which the boxer swings his arm from the shoulder with 
the elbow bent.<br>
<strong>Slap: </strong>An illegal blow landed with the open 
part of the glove (not the knuckle area).<br>
<strong>Standing eight count: 
</strong>A precautionary measure taken by the referee to allow a boxer to 
recover after receiving a heavy blow/series of blows.</p> 
<p> Legends </p> 
<p> Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon of Cuba; Muhammad Ali (then Cassius 
Clay), gold medal winner in Rome in 1960; Lennox Lewis (then fighting for 
Canada); Sugar Ray Leonard; Oscar De La Hoya; Joe Frazier.</p> 
<p> Random Fact </p> 
<p> Iranian boxer Ali Kazemi turned up for his light-heavyweight boxing fight 
at the Barcelona 1992 Olympics without his gloves and was duly disqualified.</p>

<h3> How many medals targeted by Team GB? </h3> 
<p> Two minimum, although five are possible. Prospects enhanced slightly with 
inclusion of women's boxing.</p> 
<h3> Where are the chances? </h3> 
<p> GB has strong prospects of medals in the women&rsquo;s events as well as 
the men&rsquo;s events.</p> 
<h3> Brits to watch? </h3> 
<p> Nicola Adams, flyweight; Savannah Marshall, middleweight; Khalid Yafai, 
flyweight; Simon Vallily, heavyweight; Tom Stalker, lightweight; Luke Campbell 
and Iain Weaver, bantamweight</p> 
<h3> Biggest international rivals? </h3> 
<p> Katie Taylor (Ireland), lightweight; Mary Kom (India), flyweight; Paddy 
Barnes (Ireland) light-flyweight; Suranjoy Singh (India), flyweight; Roberto 
Cammarelle (Italy), super-heavyweight.</p> 
<h3> How to qualify </h3> 
<p> Countries can enter a maximum of one athlete per weight class (10 for men 
and three for women). As hosts Team GB are automatically given one female and 
five male spots. In the men&rsquo;s competition the top two finishers at each 
weight class in the World Series of Boxing Individual Championships in May 2011 
secure Olympic spots. A top 10 finish (six for heavyweight and 
super-heavyweight) at the World Championships also secures qualification. 
Remaining places are filled via continental Olympic qualification tournaments 
and invitations. In the women&rsquo;s event the top eight finishers at the 
World Championships qualify for the Games.</p>
