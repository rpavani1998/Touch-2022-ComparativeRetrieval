<b>$349 </b>
&nbsp;<b><b>Sold</b><b> </b></b><b>&lt; </b>Find me one! &gt; <br>
 Known as 
&quot;Smokin' Joe&quot; because of his style of constantly boring in and 
throwing punches, Frazier didn't have a great knockout punch, but he wore 
opponents down with his relentless attack. He won 32 professional fights, 27 by 
knockout; lost 4, 3 by knockout; and fought 1 draw. Frazier was the 1964 
Olympic heavyweight champion and the World Hevyweight Champion from 1970 to 
1973. Joe was most famous however for his three epic bouts with Muhammad Ali. 
In 1971 Frazier and Ali, both undefeated as professionals, met in one of the 
most ballyhooed matches in boxing history. That night at Madison Square Garden 
Frazier knocked Ali down with a left hook in the 15th round and won a unanimous 
decision that made hime the undisputed champion of the World. The third bout 
between the two, The &quot;Thrilla in Manila,&quot; is considered by many 
boxing pundits to be the greatest fight ever. The only boxer to really go toe 
to toe with Ali, this vintage 8x10 photograph of &quot;Smokin' Joe&quot; is 
hand-signed by Frazier and tastefully framed and matted. A great gift for any 
boxing fan.<br>

<b>Did you know?</b> In the suffocating heat in Quezon City, 
just outside the Philippines capital of Manila, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali 
dueled for 14 rounds in a 1975 bout Ali billed &quot;The Thrilla in 
Manila.&quot; Ali took the early rounds, before Frazier found his rhythm in the 
middle frames and attacked the champs body with both hands. But Ali turned the 
tide for good in the 10th and won the next four rounds. By the end of the 14th 
both fighters were exhausted, but Frazier's eyes were nearly swollen shut, and 
his corner stopped the bout. Later, Ali said, &quot;It was the closest I've 
come to death.&quot; <br>
