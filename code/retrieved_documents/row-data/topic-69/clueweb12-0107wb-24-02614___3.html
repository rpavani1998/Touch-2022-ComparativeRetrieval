<p>For those who like their boxing experiences way over-the-top, go with <i>
Ready 2 Rumble</i> (preferably the Dreamcast version) and stay away from the 
N64 version of Knockout Kings 2000.<b>Those looking for a more authentic 
interpretation of the sport</b>, Knockout Kings 2000, despite its flaws, is 
attractive for its many impressive features. Its impressive lineup of boxers 
(which includes the WB's Marlon Wayans and NBA's Tim Duncan!?!) is simply 
unsurpassed and there's a level of dignity and respect for the sport. But be 
weary of the complex controls that will reward those who bone-up, but frustrate 
those looking for a quick fix.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>In the high-risk industry of interactive entertainment, releasing a game 
across multiple platforms is a cost-effective method of maximizing profits 
using minimal resources. To state it plainly, companies get to hock the same 
lousy game over more platforms in hopes of catching more guppies in a larger 
pond. This practice usually leads hardcore gamers, who would naturally own more 
than one platform, into a quandary having to figure out which subtly different 
version would fancy their particular taste the most. For game reviewers like 
myself, part of my job is to inform such gamers of the slight, yet significant 
differences between these platform jumpers and to do so, we have to laboriously 
play through the same title two to three times over (depending on how many 
versions are available). Surprisingly, such was not the case with<i>Knockout 
Kings 2000</i> (<i>KK2000</i>) because the differences between the two versions 
released were anything but subtle. While the Nintendo 64 version sported arcade 
qualities like power-up punches and outrageous flips, the PlayStation one 
delivered a more well-rounded product containing realistic simulation coupled 
with an arcade slugfest. This review here will focus on the PlayStation version.
</p> 
<p>Both Dale and I had serious reservations about the N64 version because the 
prospect of legendary fighters like Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Sugar Ray 
Leonard participating in silly and over-the-top romps didn't seem quite right 
to us. A game with such significant figures, we thought, would be more 
appropriate if it were a serious representation with a focus on authenticity. 
Moving on now to the PSX version, which has an even more impressive lineup 
(sans Iron Mike, Prince Nasim, and George Foreman), it's worth noting that 
right off the bat, it does a better job of honoring legendary and contemporary 
boxers alike not just in its visuals, but in its gameplay as well.</p> 
<p>In terms of modes offered, the most engaging is the 'Career' mode where 
players can create their own personalized fighter, slowly develop his boxing 
skills, and then go for the championship in his respective weight class. Then 
there's the 'classic' mode that allows players to simulate legendary matches 
like the<i>Thrilla in Manilla</i> (Ali vs. Frazier), or Leonard vs. Durant or 
Leonard vs. Hagler. Mini-biographies for the huge cast of boxers are even 
included. Finally, of course, there is the obligatory antithesis, Slugfest 
mode, which allows for less serious boxing fans to pit hefty boxers like 
Butterbean against lighter peers like De La Hoya, complete with power-up 
punches and other arcade touches. Though contrary to the strengths of the game, 
the Slugfest mode isn't a blemish mainly because it's here as an addition 
rather than as an integral part of the overall package.</p> 
<p><i>KK2000</i> plays like a no-nonsense, yet full-featured interpretation of 
boxing. If you've ever seen it in the ring, you can probably do it in the game 
(with the exception of having some idiot parachuting into the ring and, 
thankfully, the patented Tyson-ear chomp). Lunging hooks, combination flurries, 
and clinches are all here, as well as the less sportsmanlike low blows, elbows, 
and, my personal favorite, kidney punches. Every button on the PlayStation 
controller is utilized (for better or worse) with the most basic punches 
relegated to the four main buttons while blocking is handled with the L1 (high) 
and L2 (low) shoulder buttons. Things start to get hairy, however, when the 
player is called upon to press two or more buttons in conjunction (to initiate 
certain moves) right in the middle of a flurry.</p> 
<p>For instance, along with low blocking, depressing the L2 button is required 
for lower body shots. But holding down the R1 button will then convert the four 
main buttons into flurry punches. Throw in holding down the R2 and those 
punches turn into powerful lunging ones. Now holding down R1 and R2 at the same 
time will convert the four main buttons into dirty attacks like low blows. 
Still with me? Holding down L1 and R1 will put two combatants in a clinch and 
then the four main buttons will execute rabbit punches, but hold down the R1 
during a clinch and you'll get kidney blows. On top of that, signature attacks 
require pressing two of the four main buttons together and don't even get me 
started on the combinations outside of the flurries that require<i>Tekken</i>
-like combo patterns. Sound confusing? You bet it is. It took me quite a while 
to come to grips with the control scheme and you better believe your casual 
gamer is going to give up long before that. Thankfully, training sessions 
incurred during the 'career' mode will actually try to 'school' players on how 
to properly execute the extensive techniques, but don't expect the training to 
be as comprehensive as it should have been considering the complexity of the 
controls.</p> 
<p>Aside from the dense controls, I also had minor issues with <i>KK2000</i> 
being billed as a realistic simulator. For the most part,<i>KK2000</i> delivers 
what it promises, but strangely enough, I was able to pummel through the ranks 
largely utilizing only body blow combos. I wasn't intentionally trying to find 
buggy holes in the system; I simply couldn't find any other successful 
technique. Computer opponents tended to protect their faces more while exposing 
their bodies excessively. Being that holding down the L2 button is used for 
blocking and lower attacks, it also made more sense to attack low because I 
could quickly revert to a defensive position, though I don't think that's what 
the developers had in mind. One other thing to note was that in one match I had 
against Floyd Patterson, I threw over 1,600 punches and landed more than half! 
I don't know about you, but it sounds a bit extreme to me for a simulator.</p> 
<p>The developers clearly have their hearts in the right place here. Yet, the 
final execution isn't what I would describe as stellar, but serviceable. 
There's a good attempt at giving<i>KK2000</i> some personality and hip-hop flav 
by gracing the soundtrack and general background music with multiple 
full-fledge rap songs (by nobodies, but complete with an MTV-style music 
video). But beyond the tunes, everything else feels mediocre. Boxers are 
modeled accurately, but the aging PlayStation has a hard-time breathing life 
into them. There's heavy banding in the bland colors and after dozens of 
matches, the animations, while smooth, start to feel monotonous and canned. The 
repetitious animation really hurts the game because aside from their bodily 
appearances, none of the fighters have any trademark swaggering entrances to 
the ring or any distinct pre- or postfight verbal trash-talking or physical 
posturing that gives boxing its edgy bite (and I'm not talking about Tyson 
again). Ali stung opponents with his mouth as well as his fists.</p> 
<p><i>KK2000</i> suffers a bit by being overly ambitious with its 
comprehensive roster, but in a good way. I lobbied many complaints and admit to 
being overly critical of the game, but that's only because I see a tremendous 
potential for the franchise to entrench itself as the genre-defining standard. 
With the flaws that I mentioned, I can't see<i>KK2000</i> proclaiming that just 
yet. Still, with the reality of today's market, there's but a few scant choices 
for true boxing fans and<i>KK2000</i> is still a very attractive package and 
the only simulator-like game in town. So while I was hampered by the complex 
controls and turned off by the lack of unique animation, I still enjoyed 
playing the game and it held my interest long enough for me work my way up to 
the heavyweight championship and defend it several times. So<i>KK2000</i> 
misses the moon, but at least ends up in the stars.</p> <i>- Published November
