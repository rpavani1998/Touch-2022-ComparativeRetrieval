<br> 
<p>To evaluate and compare the relative popularity of fighters from different 
historical eras, I used four separate and more or less equal criteria:</p> 
<p>1. Stature and fame within the sports world and popular culture of their 
own era;</p> 
<p>2. Lasting visibility within modern popular culture;</p> 
<p>3. Actual historical importance as a fighter;</p> 
<p>4. Genuine affection from the public.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have tried my best to make this an objective list. This is not a list of 
my 20 favorite fighters.</p> 
<p>However, I am a 41-year-old American fan and that shows. I've selected 
fighters from the late 1800s through the present, but fighters from the 1970s, 
'80s and '90s are heavily represented. There is also a clear bias towards North 
American fighters, with popularity largely defined by visibility within the 
United States media.</p> 
<p>For example, the Klitschko brothers' fights in Germany have the atmosphere 
of rock concerts and the two are major celebrities both there and in their 
native Ukraine. A European fan could fairly object that the brothers are as 
popular as many of the fighters on my list.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Heavyweights dominate here, which should hardly come as a surprise. For 
many decades of the 20th century, boxing was among the most popular of 
professional sports and the heavyweight champion, by definition, was one of the 
most popular heroes of the day.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>20: Roy Jones Jr. </h2> <br>
Ethan Miller/Getty Images <br>

<p>Since May of 2004,&nbsp;Roy Jones Jr.&nbsp;55(40)-8(4), has compiled a 6-7 
record and the only notable opponent he has beaten was a smaller, 
past-his-prime Felix Trinidad. This eight-year stretch of sub-mediocrity has 
somewhat obscured the fact that he was the most talented boxer of his 
generation, and one of the top few pound-for-pound fighters of the past 40 
years.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Prior to 2004, Jones' only career loss had been a disqualification against 
Montell Griffin. In 1997,<em>International Boxing Digest&nbsp;</em>ranked him 
as the top&nbsp;pound-for-pound fighter of all time.</p> 
<p>Jones had already become well known to American sports fans prior to the 
1988 Seoul Olympics, in which he was considered a sure bet for gold. He ended 
up winning a silver medal, instead, but only because he fell victim to perhaps 
the worst judging decision in the history of Olympic boxing, losing to Korean 
native Park Si-Hun.</p> 
<p>I can still vividly see Si-Hun in my mind's eye, turning his head and 
staring in disbelief, stunned along with everybody else as the ref raised his 
hand in victory.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Jones' brilliant pro career unfortunately coincided with an era when boxing 
as a sport was falling in popularity with the American public. Jones 
nevertheless achieved mainstream popularity, taking on acting&nbsp;roles
&nbsp;and&nbsp;recording rap albums.</p> 
<h2>19: Miguel Cotto</h2> <br>
Al Bello/Getty Images <br>

<p>I've heard Bob Arum say in press conferences that&nbsp;Miguel Cotto, 
37(30)-2(2), has sold more tickets in Madison Square Garden than any other 
fighter since 2000. I've even&nbsp;read interviews where he maintained that 
Cotto had probably sold more tickets at the Garden than Muhammad Ali.</p> 
<p>Last December I covered Cotto's rematch against Antonio Margarito in the 
Garden, so I can report firsthand that perhaps the most hallowed venue in 
boxing history is unquestionably Junito's House. The crowd at a Rangers or 
Knicks game could be no more partisan.</p> 
<p>Cotto is a kind of textbook example for how a fighter can achieve superstar 
popularity. He has an extremely passionate fanbase comprised of his fellow 
Puerto Ricans but is swelled by fans from every background who admire his 
fighting style and his determined character.</p> 
<p>If Cotto can pull off an upset against Floyd Mayweather Jr. on May 5 of 
this year, his popularity will sky rocket. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2>18: Micky Ward</h2> <br>

<p>The Pride of Lowell, Massachusetts,&nbsp;Micky Ward, 38(27)-13(1), was a 
fighter like his famed rival Arturo Gatti&mdash;the kind that made people fans 
of the sport. Off the top of my head, I can think of two different people who 
have told me they became boxing fans as a direct result of watching one of 
their three famous wars.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a boxing talent, Ward would rank somewhere above a journeyman, though he 
never won a major world title. His popularity was based upon the ferocious way 
he fought&mdash;particularly his brutal body attacks, which stood in stark 
contrast to his calm and soft-spoken demeanor.</p> 
<p>Of course it's no secret that Ward's spot on this list was secured thanks 
to Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of him in the 2010 biopic<em>The Fighter</em>. 
Ward's career made him a beloved figure to boxing fans, but having his exciting 
story dramatized in an award-winning movie starring one of Hollywood's biggest 
stars took his popularity to a new level. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2>17: Oscar De La Hoya</h2> <br>
Ethan Miller/Getty Images <br>

<p>To me,&nbsp;Oscar De La Hoya,&nbsp;39(30)-6(2), sometimes seems like the 
last great American boxing star, an Olympic gold medal hero enthusiastically 
embraced by the public from the very start of his career.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Golden Boy&quot; returned from Barcelona in 1992 with his 
likeness on a box of Wheaties and his name already splashed across the pages of 
important publications like&nbsp;<em>Sports Illustrated</em>. Within two years 
and 12 fights, he had beaten 16-0 Jimmi Bredahl for the WBO super featherweight 
title.</p> 
<p>For the rest of the decade, De La Hoya took on and defeated some of the 
sport's toughest competitors, such as Julio Cesar Chavez, Pernell Whitaker, 
Hector Camacho and Ike Quartey.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Still a young man, De La Hoya has already transitioned into a very 
successful promotional career and remains among the sport's most visible 
figures. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2>16: Julio Cesar Chavez</h2> <br>

<p>Julio Cesar Chavez,&nbsp;107(86)-6(4)-2, was among the greatest boxing 
attractions of the 1980's and perhaps the greatest Mexican champion of all 
time. Chavez had a relentless, crowd-pleasing style, a granite chin and a 
brutally punishing body attack.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chavez's last-second, come-from-behind knockout of Meldrick Taylor was&nbsp;
<em>The Ring's&nbsp;</em>Fight of the Year for 1990 and was later selected as 
fight of the decade. Tragically, Chavez's furious attack destroyed Taylor as an 
elite fighter and quite likely precipitated his post-career health problems.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of controversy over whether or not Richard Steele's 
stoppage with two seconds left was appropriate. My own opinion is that Taylor 
had already taken significant damage going into the last round (even though I 
would still score him comfortably ahead) and was in desperate condition, and 
with more than enough time left for Chavez to possibly&nbsp;put him into a coma.
</p> 
<p>Against Greg Haugen in Mexico City, Chavez fought in front of over 130,000 
fans.</p> 
<h2>15: Jake Lamotta</h2> <br>

<p>The <em>Rocky </em>series might be more commercially popular, but I'd be 
willing to bet that a poll of movie critics and film school graduates would be 
nearly unanimous in naming<em>Raging Bull, </em>the story of Jake Lamotta's 
turbulent career and life,&nbsp;the greatest boxing movie ever made.</p> 
<p>Jake Lamotta, 83(30)-19(4)-4, was a world champion and an extremely popular 
fighter during his career, at a time when boxing stood alongside baseball as 
the nation's most popular sport. But in<em>Raging Bull, </em>Robert De Niro did 
for Lamotta what Marky Mark did for Micky Ward, except on steroids.</p> 
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that&nbsp;De Niro's performance in this movie 
made the Bronx Bull a cultural icon. The line, &quot;You never got me down, 
Ray,&quot; was a kind of all-purpose statement of defiance among sports and pop 
culture wise guys of my generation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I think the clip I've linked here deserves to be on a short list of the 
most well-crafted movie scenes in the history of film. It's not too radically 
far from the actualfinish, either.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>14: Floyd Mayweather Jr. </h2> <br>
Jeff Gross/Getty Images <br>

<p>If this was a list of most disliked fighters, Floyd Mayweather Jr, 
42(26)-0, could very well be at the top of it. If you doubt me, spend a little 
time browsing the Bleacher Report&nbsp;readers' comment section.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But that kind of public animosity is a form of popularity all by itself. 
And Mayweather has no shortage of legitimate fans. Mayweather has been among 
the greatest pay-per-view revenue generators in the sport's history. He is a 
big enough mainstream star to have walked into professional wrestling 
pay-per-view events.</p> 
<p>Mayweather is unquestionably among the most skilled boxers of his 
generation and never hesitates to rank himself as the greatest of all time. 
With his big May 5 bout with Miguel Cotto looming and his jail sentence behind 
that, it's a tough time to really assess what Mayweather's ultimate, all-time 
standing might be.</p> 
<p>Either way, he's been one of the sport's biggest stars during an era when 
boxing has had few enough of them left. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2>13: Rocky Graziano</h2> <br>

<p>Born and raised on New York City's lower east side during the years when it 
was a violent ghetto,Rocky Graziano, 67(52)-10(3)-6, overcame a misspent youth 
and stints in reform school and jail to become a world middleweight champion 
and one of the hardest punchers to ever fight in the 160-pound division.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>In the late 1940's he fought a classic three-fight series with Tony 
Zale.&nbsp;The first fight, a six-round KO victory by Zale, was<em>The Ring 
</em>1946 Fight of the Year. The second fight, a six-round TKO win for 
Graziano, won the same honors in 1947.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But it was Graziano's post-fight career that pushed his popularity into the 
mainstream. Graziano's autobiography,<em>Somebody Up There Likes Me, </em>was 
the basis for the Oscar-winning 1956 movie starring Paul Newman.</p> 
<p>Graziano himself gravitated towards show business and acted in television 
shows and appeared on variety shows from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s. 
He also took up painting and had his work displayed in numerous New York City 
galleries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>12: Joe Frazier</h2> <br>
Cameron Spencer/Getty Images <br>

<p>This is one of the entries on the list that I anguished over, because I 
wonder if I have Joe Frazier ranked high enough. At the height of his career, 
he was among the most well-known fighters in the word, simply by virtue of 
being Muhammad Ali's greatest rival.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But with his explosive and relentless style, his Olympic gold medal and 
world heavyweight championship. He would have been a very popular fighter, even 
if he and Ali had never crossed paths. But ultimately, while he could be 
humorous and engaging in interviews or during public appearances, he was never 
quite the gregarious entertainer that Ali was and George Foreman became. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Frazier died tragically last November, marking a very sad day for boxing 
fans everywhere. I was lucky enough to cover the Cotto-Margarito card not long 
afterwards, and prior to the card I got to attend a panel with Joe's son, 
Marvis, where he talked about his own experiences fighting in the Garden and 
his memories of his father's fabled wars there.</p> 
<p>Naturally, there was a tribute to &quot;Smokin' Joe&quot; during the main 
card, a moment during which more than a few middle-aged and elderly men shed 
tears.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>11: Archie Moore</h2> <br>

<p>&quot;The Old Mongoose&quot; Archie Moore, 185(131)-23(7)-10, had a career 
that lasted for nearly 30 years, from 1935 to 1963. He is regarded by many 
boxing historians and writers as the top light heavyweight of all time, and 
Boxrec.com has him No. 1 on their all-timepound-for-pound rankings.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moore was a slick boxer, a powerful puncher and defensive wizard. He was 
also charismatic and engaging, and as his career was winding down, Hollywood 
beckoned. The September 2011 issue of<em>The Ring </em>ran a nice story by Don 
Stradley about Moore's acting career, extensively detailing the critical 
acclaim of Moore's turn as Jim in the 1960 film version of<em>Huckleberry 
Finn.&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>Moore's debut ended up being the peak of his acting career, though he did 
landmany more roles on television shows throughout the 1960s and early 
70s.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>10: Sugar Ray Leonard</h2> <br>

<p>Ray Leonard, 36(25)-3(1)-1, exploded onto the American sports world during 
the 1976 Montreal Olympics, when he won a gold medal as part of the most 
celebrated U.S. Olympic boxing team ever assembled.</p> 
<p>The charismatic kid was so slick and sweet that he earned the ultimate 
honor, the nickname of &quot;Sugar&quot; Ray, an homage to the legendary Sugar 
Ray Robinson.</p> 
<p>Leonard was a mainstream sports star in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He 
was among the last boxing stars to build up a fanbase through fighting on 
network television.</p> 
<p>He sold soft drinks and chatted with Oprah and meanwhile beat all-time 
great champions like Wilfred Benitez, Thomas Hearns, Robert Duran and Marvin 
Hagler. &nbsp;</p> 
<h2>9: Manny Pacquiao</h2> <br>
Mike Lawrie/Getty Images <br>

<p>The Pacman's popularity is an explosive phenomenon that is still happening, 
so any attempt to evaluate it right now can do no more than provide a temporary 
snapshot.</p> 
<p>He is one of the two top pay-per-view earners in the sport. Pacquiao is so 
popular in his native Philippines that he was able to get elected to the 
Congress there, despite a lack of any real qualifications to hold office and an 
inability to serve more than part-time while continuing to train to be perhaps 
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter on the planet.</p> 
<p>Pacquiao is the most popular active boxer in the United States. His 
charismatic personality and propensity for knocking out much larger opponents 
won him legions of fans who don't traditionally pay much attention to the 
sport. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>8: Rocky Marciano</h2> <br>

<p>Rocky Marciano, 49(43)-0, is the only man to ever retire as the undefeated 
heavyweight champion of the world. His wild popularity was driven by the fact 
that he so often won with style: up from the canvas to KO Archie Moore in nine; 
putting away Ezzard Charles in eight when he was in danger of losing on cuts; 
dropping Joe Walcott dramatically in 13 when trailing far behind on the cards.
</p> 
<p>Marciano was <em>The Ring </em>Fighter of the Year in 1952, '54 and '55. In 
retirement, Marciano dabbled in acting, before dying tragically in a plane 
crash the night before he would have turned 46.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>7: Jack Dempsey</h2> <br>

<p>Jack Dempsey, 61(50)-6(1)-9, was the most popular fighter of his era and 
one of the great sports figures of all time. The &quot;Manassa Mauler&quot; had 
a furious and explosive style that thrilled crowds, and a left hook the likes 
of which the division would not see again until Joe Frazier arrive a 
half-century later.</p> 
<p>Dempsey's popularity only grew in retirement. In his 40's, he served 
heroically during World War II and his restaurant, Jack Dempsey's, was a New 
York City institution for years.</p> 
<h2>6: Sugar Ray Robinson</h2> <br>

<p>I'm not sure if the term &quot;pound-for-pound&quot; was actually invented 
forSugar Ray Robinson, 173(108)-19(1)-6, but it might as well have been. 
Nobody's name has ever been used as often in the same sentence.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Robinson's two-fisted power and slick boxing dazzled crowds at a time when 
boxing was at its most popular. In the post-World War II era, he was the 
stylish embodiment of hip, uptown New York glamour.</p> 
<p>Robinson is one of the towering figures in the history of boxing, and a 
iconic figure in American popular culture. People who have never watched a 
round of boxing would have no trouble identifying &quot;Sugar Ray&quot; as a 
boxing reference.</p> 
<h2>5: Mike Tyson</h2> <br>

<p>Mike Tyson exploded into American pop culture as an teenage phenomenon. 
When he stopped Trevor Berbick in two rounds for the WBC strap in 1986, he was 
the youngest heavyweight champion in history, and still not old enough to 
legally buy beer.</p> 
<p>Iron Mike was a street kid handpicked out of reform school by Cus D'Amato, 
to become a world champion. His was among the most meteoric rises in the 
history of American society, let alone sports or boxing.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, the transition from rejected throw-away child to sports 
superstar was difficult, and once D'Amato passed away early in Tyson's career, 
things went downhill relatively quickly. In February of 1990 he was knocked out 
in Tokyo by Buster Douglas, one of the greatest upsets in boxing history.</p> 
<p>Although he was still not 24 years old, he had already reached his peak as 
a professional fighter.</p> 
<p>Tyson's history of personal and legal problems is too long to detail here. 
Between 1991 and 1995 he served nearly four years on a rape charge. He bit 
Evander Holyfield's ear and threatened to eat Lennox Lewis' children.</p> 
<p>Through it all, Tyson has maintained a large fanbase. The crowds at his 
Hall of Fame induction last year were large and supportive, and the now 
middle-aged Tyson was visibly moved and unable to finish his speech. When a fan 
shouted &quot;We love you Mike,&quot; the crowd broke into applause.</p> 
<p>In recent years, Tyson has seemed to turn a corner in his public persona. 
His cameo in<em>The Hangover</em>&nbsp;created a sensation and led to a larger 
involvement in the sequel. Clearly the American public wants to embrace the 
enigmatic and formerly fearsome champ.</p> 
<p>At only 46 years of age, Tyson's popularity appears set to grow. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>4: George Foreman</h2> <br>

<p>If George Foreman had not launched one of the most improbable comebacks in 
sports history in 1987, he would not be on this list. His career from 1969 to 
1977 was one of the most impressive in boxing history, but it did not earn him 
an overwhelming amount of affection from the public.</p> 
<p>The Big George who came back in 1987 was destined to become one of the most 
beloved fighters of all time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In his second career, Big George was a gregarious, charismatic, 
larger-than-life figure. When he upset Michael Moorer for the heavyweight title 
in 1994, he became a hero to just about every middle-aged man in America.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>He used his new popularity to transform himself into a cottage industry, a 
one-man endorsement machine. In 1993 he starred in his own sitcom, titled<em>
George</em>.</p> 
<p>To this day, &quot;The George Foreman Grill&quot; is a very popular product 
and Foreman himself remains among the sport's top broadcasters.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>3: John L. Sullivan</h2> <br>

<p>John L. Sullivan was the first boxing champion of the gloved era and 
arguably the first American sports superstar ever. At the height of his career, 
he was as popular as any fighter who ever stepped into the ring.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sullivan seems to have enjoyed drinking and telling stories at least as 
much as he liked to fight. According to Nat Fleisher's seminal book<em>The 
Heavyweights,</em>Sullivan capped off a tour of England by meeting with the 
King and told him, &quot;Look me up if you're ever in Boston. I'll make sure 
they take care of you.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At a time when the boxing game was only marginally even legal in most parts 
of the United States, Sullivan earned the largest parts of his fortune touring 
and putting on exhibitions. He had studied elocution and drama at Boston 
College briefly before dropping out and used the skills he had acquired when he 
frequently performed on the stage.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sullivan's colorful life is a biopic waiting to happen, if only an actor 
can be found in Hollywood manly enough to play the great John L.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>2: Joe Louis</h2> <br>

<p>Joe Louis ruled the heavyweight division from 1937 to 1949, far longer than 
any other man. But he was a sports star whose significance far surpassed the 
world of sports.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When he emerged in the late 1930s as a champion, he was passionately 
embraced by the African-American community. The poet Maya Angelou devotes an 
entire chapter of her memoir to recounting the wild celebrations that engulfed 
her rural southern community when Joe Louis fought.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But as World War II approached, Louis became a hero to the entire nation 
when he faced the German champion Max Schmeling. This was a crucial development 
in the evolution of the United States into a more legitimately multicultural 
society.&nbsp;Against Hitler's favorite, the &quot;Brown Bomber&quot; became 
&quot;our guy&quot; for an entire nation still struggling, and very often 
failing, to overcome an extremely racist legacy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When the war came, Louis enlisted and was assigned to the Special Services 
Unit. Along with Sugar Ray Robinson, he spent the war touring military bases 
and entertaining his fellow soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>1: Muhammad Ali</h2> <br>
Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images <br>

<p>There could be no other name at the top of a list like this. In the United 
States and across the globe, Muhammad Ali is not only the most popular boxer of 
all time. Along with perhaps Pele and Michael Jordan, he is the most famous 
athlete of all time.</p> 
<p>At the height of his career, he was possibly the most popular&nbsp;<em>
person</em>&nbsp;on the planet.</p> 
<p>In the 1960s, Ali became a symbol of the cultural rebellion that was 
sweeping the nation and the world. When he refused induction into the military 
during the Vietnam War he was stripped of his title and threatened with jail 
time. He became a pariah to much of the mainstream media, but also a hero that 
transcended sports to a generation of young people.</p> 
<p>His first fight with Joe Frazier in 1971 was perhaps the most highly 
anticipated sporting event ever. Ali lost his initial bid to reclaim his title, 
but later succeeded in thrilling fashion, upsetting the heavily favored George 
Foreman in Zaire. Their fight, famously dubbed &quot;The Rumble in the 
Jungle,&quot; was later the subject of the 1996 Oscar-winning documentary<em>
When We Were Kings.</em></p> 
<p><em></em>By the end of Ali's storied career, he had transformed from 
cultural rebel to beloved icon. A Saturday morning cartoon portrayed his 
fictional, Scooby Doo-style adventures. He did guest appearances on popular 
sitcoms like<em>Different Strokes.</em>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ali has famously suffered from Parkinson's disease in his retirement years, 
slowing down his ability to lead a public life. Nevertheless, his star has 
never really diminished, as was evident at his recent 70th birthday celebration 
at theMGM Grand in Las Vegas.</p> Begin Slideshow <br>
