Wins? (Part II) <br>

&nbsp; Another question when we ponder who would win if Muhammad Ali 
fought Mike Tyson...</p> 
<p>(Please refresh your memory with part one here.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Realistically, could you envision Tyson backing up, trying to 
entice Ali onto him?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or could you see Ali going forward, being the aggressor?</p> 
<p>&nbsp; If the answer is no to both questions, then the likely scenario in a 
fight between Ali and Tyson would involve both fighters doing what they did 
BEST, when they were at their BEST.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Prime Tyson [1986-89]&nbsp; would be going forward, pressing the 
attack and trying to get inside, while Prime Ali [1963-71]&nbsp; would be 
attempting to keep the fight at his distance, by backing up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Ali [6' 3''] is taller than Tyson [5' 10''] and has the reach 
advantage, so he would be trying to keep the fight at arms length. Ali's 
flicker jab was one of the best in boxing history. Because Ali could throw his 
jab whilst moving, he did not have to plant his feet, thus making it harder for 
his opponents to shorten the distance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyson could have neutralised Ali's jab with his defense. Tyson 
was very tough to hit clean during at his peak. His head movement was superb, 
resembling a pendulum swinging from side to side. Whilst advancing, Tyson liked 
to dip to the right or left, slip a punch, create an angle and come back with a 
hook from either hand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyson was able to combine offense and defense simultaneously. 
Ali would be throwing his left jab and moving to his left. Punching at a 
downward angle, across his own body, the shorter Tyson dipping to his left or 
right, would have created the perfect angle for a counter hook from either side.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Like Joe Frazier, Tyson was&nbsp; a very dangerous left hooker. 
Because his right hand was never brought back to a defensive position, Ali was 
vulnerable for a left hook throughout his career. If not for a bit of quick 
thinking from Angelo Dundee, Henry Cooper's left hook may have stopped Ali in 
their fight.&nbsp; Frazier's left hook on the other hand, landed often during 
their fights, almost decapitating Ali in '71.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; As with Joe Frazier, Ali would be having to punch a constantly 
moving target. Take a look at the&nbsp;Ali versus Frazier from '71. Joe made 
Ali miss more in that fight than in any other fight during Ali's career. Why? 
Because of Joe's size, footwork and tremendous head movement.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; During his prime, Tyson's head movement was arguably even better 
than Joe's.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Muhammad Ali's toughest opponent from a stylistic standpoint along 
with Joe Frazier was undoubtedly ken Norton. By parrying Ali's jab, utilising 
his own jab and also employing side to side head movement, Norton was able to 
take away Ali's own jab and disrupt his rhythm.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Ring any bells?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Take a look at prime Tyson, some of his most underrated assets were 
the use of his own jab and his ability to pick off his opponents' punches using 
his gloves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; In terms of overall speed, it's difficult to say who was faster. Ali 
and Tyson would be bringing more speed to the table than either fighter will 
have ever encountered during their careers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ali used his footspeed more for creating distance defending, 
while Tyson used his footspeed more for closing the distance and attacking. 
Ali's handspeed was blinding, but most of his punches were straight, STINGING 
punches, whereas Tyson would put together five or six POWER shots in a row. As 
opposed to Ali, and his straight less harmful shots, Tyson's combinations were 
made up of hooks and uppercuts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; The most problematic scenario for Ali against in a fight with Mike 
Tyson would be an inside fight against the ropes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; Sure, 
Ali's movement at his best was sublime. Fighters like Sonny Liston, Zora Folley 
and an aging Archie Moore could barely touch him. But against fighters who came 
close to matching his footspeed, Ali was often found having to defend with his 
back to the ropes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; At his apex in the mid sixties, Ali was an in and out fighter. Ali 
would be out of range, jabbing, then come in with a combination, then get back 
out. He was in and out.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Fighters that knew how to isolate Ali's footwork with their own 
footwork [Jones, Frazier, Norton, Young] could have success against him. Tyson 
would be capable of matching Ali's negative footspeed with his positive 
footspeed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A boxer moving backwards against a pressure fighter that can 
match his footwork and footspeed will always end up against the ropes, unless 
they have an inside game. Mike Tyson was the last fighter anyone would want in 
front of them when their backs were on the ropes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; In a fight between boxing's biggest icons, there are endless 
tangibles to take into account. We have merely scratched the surface.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; However, based on styles,&nbsp;it is this writer's opinion that 
prime Mike Tyson defeats prime Muhammad Ali. Barely.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Ali would have success. Ali would not be knocked out. His chin 
wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; Ali would likely frustrate Tyson at times, using&nbsp; 
his height and reach.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;However, Tyson's relentless pressure at his best made an inside fight 
unavoidable. James Tillis managed to avoid it for a while, but by being 
negative, he lost nearly every round.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;In a similar looking 
fight to like Julio Cesar Chavez versus Hector Camacho, Tyson would be able to 
feint his way inside and shorten the distance. Tyson's footwork, head movement 
and footspeed would trump Ali's height and length.&nbsp; It's hard to envision 
Ali being able to keep Tyson under control. Ali was deceptively strong in 
close, but Tyson was very explosive. Frazier liked to camp on the inside. Tyson 
used to invade it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on what was evident during the fights between Ali versus 
Doug Jones, Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, and Tyson versus Buster Douglas and 
Evander Holyfield, evidence points to Tyson being more problematic for Ali as 
opposed to the other way around. Ali would NOT be able to back Tyson up by 
fighting on the back foot, flicking the jab. Tyson would be able to impose 
himself on Ali.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who will disagree and bring up Tyson's 
psychological problems, stamina or his heart. There are those that will point 
to Ali's height, reach and will to win.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Agreed, Ali did always seem to find a way to win, and who knows, 
maybe his heart and desire would have found away to neutralise&nbsp; Tyson's 
threat. Ali is not considered the greatest heavyweight of all time for nothing.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; In reality, Ali versus Tyson is a mythical matchup. Pure 
fantasy. There is no way of knowing for certain, who would be victorious.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; But, everybody loves a debate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;And just one more thing....Who would you pick?</p>

<p>Hehehehe! I've already said that the Iron one would be psyched long before 
the bout started and would be crying like a bytch in the dressing room. He 
probably would even enter the ring, so that the GOAT Ali would boom. The GOAT 
Ali beats the mentally weak Iron Mike easily IMHA. Holla!</p> <strong>Radam G

<p>Tyson needed room to punch, in close all he did was clinch---he couldn't 
punch on the inside. Need proof? Watch Tyson-Holyfield I and Tyson-Botha. Ali 
would've destroyed him. His head/upper body movement was predictable aswere his 
punch selection. Ali, being far the more intelligent and tougher fighter 
would've walked him into his one-twos and knocked him out late.</p> <strong>
