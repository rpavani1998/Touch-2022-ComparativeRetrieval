<br>Joseph William &quot;Joe&quot; Frazier, born January 12, 1944), known as 
Smokin' Joe, is a former Olympic and Undisputed World Heavyweight boxing 
champion, whose notable professional career lasted from 1965 to 1976, with a 
brief comeback in 1981.</p>
<p>Frazier emerged as the top contender in the late-1960s, defeating Jerry 
Quarry, Oscar Bonavena, Buster Mathis, Eddie Machen, Doug Jones and Jimmy Ellis 
en route to becoming undisputed heavyweight champion in 1970, and followed up 
by defeating Bob Foster and Muhammad Ali on points in the highly-anticipated 
&quot;Fight of the Century&quot; in 1971. Two years later Frazier lost his 
title when he was knocked out by George Foreman. He fought on beating Joe 
Bugner, losing a rematch to Ali, and beating Quarry and Ellis again.</p>
<p>Frazier's last world title challenge came in 1975, but he was beaten by Ali 
in their brutal rubbermatch. He retired in 1976 following a second loss to 
Foreman. He made a comeback in 1981, fighting just once, before retiring for 
good. The International Boxing Research Organization (IBRO) rates Frazier among 
the ten greatest heavyweights of all time. He is an inductee of both the 
International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.</p>
