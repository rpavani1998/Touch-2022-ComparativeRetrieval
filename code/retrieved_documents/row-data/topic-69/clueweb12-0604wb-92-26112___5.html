<p>Moments before the start of the Dec. 29, 1980, Nevada Athletic Commission 
hearing to revokeMuhammad Ali&rsquo;s boxing license, the legendary fighter 
told me: &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this something &mdash; one bad day on the job and 
they want to fire me.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>For Ali, then 38, it indeed had been a bad day &mdash; make that night. On 
Oct. 2, 1980, then-world heavyweight championLarry Holmes pummeled Ali and 
ended Ali&rsquo;s dream of winning a record fourth world title. Ali was so 
overmatched that regulators believed for his own health he shouldn&rsquo;t be 
allowed to fight again.</p> 
<p>I interviewed Ali about a half-dozen times between 1980 and 2000. Away from 
the TV cameras, Ali was a soft-spoken gentleman who could be downright 
philosophical &mdash; nothing like the loudmouth showman the public saw during 
his long and illustrious career.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Ali truly did think he was pretty &mdash; and he 
was, from his handsome face and his sleek physique (in his prime) to his 
surprisingly delicate hands.</p> 
<p>And what an ego. I really believe he got a thrill shifting into Ali mode, 
trash-talking rivals and performing outrageously every time a microphone was 
stuck in his face or a camera was rolling.</p> 
<p>But Ali proved time and again he could back up the taunts and raves, 
including his rhyming predictions of the rounds when he would defeat his foes.
</p> 
<p>But on the day the Athletic Commission &ldquo;fired&rdquo; Ali, 
boxing&rsquo;s best salesman was subdued and accepting of his fate. After hours 
of damning testimony, Ali and his lawyers cut a deal.</p> 
<p>Ali would give up his Nevada license, and the Nevada Athletic Commission 
would not oppose Ali getting a license to fight elsewhere. The deal paved the 
way for Ali to fight the lateTrevor Berbick on Dec. 11, 1981, in the Bahamas. 
Ali lost that fight, too.</p> 
<p>But Ali got to go out on his own terms. It meant vindication for Ali, which 
was important to the sport&rsquo;s only three-time world heavyweight champion.
</p> 
<p>Striving for vindication was a thread that ran through Ali&rsquo;s life, 
whether he was battling racial prejudice or those who damned him for being a 
conscientious objector to the Vietnam War.</p> 
<p>On Saturday, Ali will be honored not only for his athletic exploits but his 
commitment to principles when he returns to Las Vegas for theKeep Memory Alive 
Power of Love Gala, a celebration of his 70th birthday. The event also will 
serve as a fundraiser for theCleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health 
and theMuhammad Ali Center, a cultural and education complex in Ali&rsquo;s 
hometown of Louisville, Ky.</p>

<p>AP Photo/File</p> 
<p>In this Oct. 1, 1975, file photo, heavyweight boxer Joe Frazier grimaces 
after Muhammad Ali, left, landed a blow to Frazier's head during their boxing 
bout in Manila, the Philippines. Ali won the fight after Frazier's manager 
stopped the fight in the 14th round. Frazier, the former heavyweight champion 
who handed Ali his first defeat yet had to live forever in his shadow, has died 
after a brief final fight with liver cancer. He was 67. The family issued a 
release confirming the boxer's death on Monday night, Nov. 7, 2011.</p> <br>

<p>In 1980, I was the 23-year-old, wet-behind-the-ears sports editor of The 
Valley Times in North Las Vegas. Ali had retired &mdash; or so he claimed 
&mdash; from boxing nearly two years earlier after beatingLeon Spinks in a 
rematch. It seemed unlikely that our paths would cross.</p> 
<p>Earlier that year, my limited body of work as a boxing writer had been 
deemed good enough for me to be invited to join theBoxing Writers Association 
of America &mdash; one of the youngest reporters ever to get that honor.</p> 
<p>In those days, a Las Vegas boxing writer could get a lot of experience 
really fast. There were weekly club boxing cards at the Silver Slipper; monthly 
cards at the Sahara, Showboat and Hacienda; and at least two major world 
championship cards each month at such venues as Caesars Palace, the Dunes and 
the Hilton.</p> 
<p>But despite satisfying my appetite to cover as many boxing matches as I 
could, I longed to interview the greatest name in that sport, or, for that 
matter, any sport &mdash; Muhammad Ali.</p> 
<p>Then rumors of an Ali comeback started circulating. I was among those 
columnists fueling the speculation, hoping to get an opportunity to cover an 
Ali fight just like my idols in boxing journalism &mdash; Nat Fleischer, Ed 
Schuyler, the Sun&rsquo;s Mike Marley and others &mdash; had.</p> 
<p>In the late summer of 1980, as promoter Don King was putting together the 
deal to pit the undefeated champ Holmes against Ali, the Nevada Athletic 
Commission, led by its new chairman, Sig Rogich, demanded that Ali pass an 
extensive physical in Las Vegas.</p> 
<p>Despite statements from former Ali ring physician Ferdie Pacheco that Ali 
had kidney damage and from a London doctor that Ali had brain damage, Rogich, a 
longtime ad executive and political mover and shaker, said he believed Ali 
could pass a physical.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m of the opinion he is in good physical shape,&rdquo; Rogich 
told me in a 1980 interview. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be an athlete like that all 
your life and not maintain some physical adeptness. I think he&rsquo;ll have 
it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But in the next breath, Rogich noted that because Ali had not fought in 22 
months he should be checked out thoroughly. In short, if Ali was seriously 
injured or killed in the Holmes fight, the commission was going to be covered.
</p> 
<p>Ali did not completely trust the Nevada Athletic Commission. He still had a 
bitter taste in his mouth over losing a close 15-round decision in the first 
Spinks fight in Las Vegas, on Feb. 15, 1978, at the hands of Nevada 
commission-appointed judges.</p> 
<p>So it was arranged for Ali to go to Rochester, Minn., to the Mayo Clinic to 
undergo tests to prove he was healthy.</p> 
<p>One of Ali&rsquo;s handlers, Gene Kilroy, a longtime Las Vegas casino 
executive, gave reports on Ali&rsquo;s progress. After results from the final 
tests came in, Gene said, &ldquo;Would you like to talk to Muhammad and get it 
straight from him?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that would be nice,&rdquo; I said calmly. Inside my head, 
however, I was saying, &ldquo;Yahoo! I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; 
Twenty-two months earlier, I was cutting cold cuts for sandwiches in my 
parents&rsquo; New Hampshire sub shop, and now I was about to report the 
historic words of a 20th century icon.</p> 
<p>Kilroy handed the phone to Ali, who was relaxing in his suite at the Kahler 
Grand Hotel in Rochester, reading reports from his many tests, among them a 
brain scan and urine and blood samples.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A staff of seven of the world&rsquo;s best doctors gave me the green 
light today, and that proved all the liars wrong,&rdquo; Ali told me, noting 
that he had been suspicious that the findings of Las Vegas doctors might be 
more political than medical.</p> 
<p>Ali told me that he had trimmed down to 233 pounds and planned to lose even 
more weight so that on Oct. 2, the world would see not the old man Ali, but the 
Ali of old, dancing for 15 rounds and earning a forth reign as champion.</p> 
<p>It turned out to be my first-ever banner story.</p> 
<p>On July 31, the commission accepted the Mayo&rsquo;s findings and the fight 
was on.</p> 
<p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> 
<p>Las Vegas News Bureau</p> 
<p>Controversial and whimsical, flamboyant and powerful, few legends 
encapsulate Old Vegas like headliners Siegfried and Roy. Here, during a 
photo-op in October 1980, the pair throw faux punches at boxing icon Muhammad 
Ali; all of whom have been represented by Bernie Yuman. The Greatest and 
magicians of a past era, joking around like kids. Now this is Old Vegas.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Muhammad Ali stepped off a flight at McCarran International Airport at 
10:23 a.m. on Sept. 9, 1980. He had dropped to 229 pounds and looked healthy.
</p> 
<p>Ali checked into Caesars Palace just before noon and by 1 p.m. was in his 
familiar white trunks with the black stripe, dancing in the ring before several 
hundred spectators who had paid $3 apiece to watch him work out.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, only a handful of reporters were on hand for Ali&rsquo;s 
first Las Vegas training session. Out-of-town press was not scheduled to arrive 
until the weekend. I knew this would be my opportunity to talk to Ali alone.</p>
<p>Midway through an uncharacteristically quiet workout, Ali warned doubting 
spectators not to waste their money betting on Holmes because Ali was going to 
shock the world again and win the fight.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Holmes will run out of gas, and I&rsquo;ll kick his ass! Get your 
tickets now!&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>I truly believed that Ali truly believed he was going to win &mdash; though 
I doubted anyone could beat Holmes at that point. Then again, in 1964, few 
people thought Ali &mdash; then known as Cassius Clay &mdash; could beat the 
seemingly unstoppableSonny Liston. But Ali knocked out Liston in seven rounds 
on Feb. 25 in Miami to win his first world title at age 22.</p> 
<p>After the workout, Ali invited me to his locker room, where we both watched 
Holmes work out. Ali gave me my second one-on-one interview with him.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;He (Holmes) is too old to do this &mdash; I&rsquo;m older than he 
is, but he&rsquo;s the one who is too old, not me,&rdquo; Ali said as Holmes 
sparred, concentrating on delivering hard body punches.</p> 
<p>Courtesy</p> 
<p>Muhammad Ali ringside circa 1970s.</p> <br>

<p>Referring to his interactions with the spectators during his workout, Ali 
said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t plan on talking to them at all &mdash; I needed my 
wind. But I had to get used to it. I&rsquo;m going to talk to Larry Holmes 
throughout the whole fight. But I won&rsquo;t psyche him out. I&rsquo;ll knock 
him out &mdash; maybe in eight rounds, maybe in nine, but no more than 
that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Asked if the Holmes fight would be his last, Ali said, &ldquo;You never 
know what I&rsquo;m going to do next. I might retire, then come back in a year 
or two and fight again.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> 
<p>Ali tipped the scales at 217 1/2 pounds at the official weigh-in. Several 
of us in the press corps shook our heads over what would turn out to be a 
serious blunder by Ali.</p> 
<p>In his efforts to look like the Ali of his prime, he had lost too much 
weight and, in effect, was dried out. (The night of the fight, Ali 
couldn&rsquo;t break a sweat, and thus he could not cool down as the fight wore 
on.)</p> 
<p>Ali&rsquo;s vanity &mdash; his tremendous ego &mdash; had gotten the better 
of him. He was more determined to look trim to impress his legion of fans 
rather than to be in better fighting shape at 224 pounds with a little fat to 
burn during the bout.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Holmes, who played second fiddle to the entertainer Ali for 
months leading up to the bout, let out his pent-up aggression. Ali was so badly 
beaten he could not come out for the 11th round. (I had predicted in my column 
that morning a Holmes victory in the 10th round by technical knockout.)</p> 
<p>Days after the fight, Ali said he was &ldquo;physically unfit&rdquo; to 
fight Holmes because he had accidentally taken an overdose of thyroid medicine 
that made him too weak.</p> 
<p>An after-fight urine test showed opiates in Ali&rsquo;s system. His 
physician, Dr. Charles Bennett, said he gave Ali a painkiller and sedative 
after the fight and before the commission doctors could get a urine sample from 
Ali.</p> 
<p>The positive drug test and the poor performance led to the 
commission&rsquo;s hearing, which was intended to put Ali out to pasture.</p> 
<p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> 
<p>On Sept. 21, 1981, Ali&rsquo;s longtime confidant and handler Bernie Yuman 
invited me to lunch with him and Ali at Caesars Caf&eacute; Roma. It was less 
than two months before Ali&rsquo;s final boxing match.</p> 
<p>After the meal, Ali turned philosophical. He stuck a finger into a glass of 
orange juice and let a single drop fall onto his plate.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;One of the teachings of Islam is that you go into the ocean and dip 
your finger in &mdash; the drop on your finger is your life and the whole ocean 
is what comes after that,&rdquo; Ali said. &ldquo;I am going to die someday. 
But right now I live in a million-dollar house that seven white men owned 
before me. I drive expensive cars. But I&rsquo;ve got to look into my future. 
There has got to be more to life than this.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p> 
<p>Nineteen years would pass before I would interview Ali again, this time at 
his suite at the Mirage.</p> 
<p>His once marvelous athletic body had been devastated by Parkinson&rsquo;s 
disease. His face was puffy, and he talked in a hushed, mumbled voice that at 
times was almost impossible to understand. But he was fully cognizant of what 
was going on around him. Before the interview, in front of Ali, Yuman warned me 
that Ali suffered from narcolepsy, which caused him to nod off during 
conversations, and that I might have to get real close to Ali to hear his voice 
as he faded into slumber.</p> 
<p>While answering my first question, Ali started to slowly pass out and I 
leaned in to hear his answer. All of a sudden, Ali &ldquo;awoke&rdquo; and made 
a roaring sound that startled me and knocked me out of my chair.</p> 
<p>I got up from the floor and looked around to see Yuman; Ali&rsquo;s 
photographer, Howard Bingham; and Ali laughing heartily over the prank they had 
just pulled.</p>

license on Dec. 29, 1980, during a Nevada Athletic Commission hearing in Las 
Vegas. Ed Koch, former Las Vegas Sun reporter, is standing beside Ali, taking 
notes.</p> <br>

<p>Ali had pulled the stunt on dozens of reporters, including the late Ed 
Bradley of &ldquo;60 Minutes.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Ali told me a second biographical film about his life was in the works, 
starring Will Smith as Ali, which I led with in my front-page story the 
following day.</p> 
<p>After the interview, I showed Ali a scrapbook I had kept of the articles 
and columns I had written about him over the years. He jokingly asked if he 
could have it. I told him I could never replace the copies of the stories I had 
written so long ago.</p> 
<p>As he handed the scrapbook back to me, Ali asked for my notepad and pen. On 
a blank page, he wrote, &ldquo;To Ed, from Muhammad Ali 2000.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Here, put this in your book,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>That was the last time I saw Ali, although I did interview him once more by 
phone in December of 2001, when the film &ldquo;Ali&rdquo; was released. He was 
about to turn 60.</p> 
<p>Ali told me the message of the film was, &ldquo;Work hard and believe and 
you will be vindicated.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I recalled what Ali had told me during our lunch at Caesars Palace two 
decades earlier. I was happy for him because, at long last, Ali had his 
vindication. He was at peace because he also had found something &ldquo;more to 
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember <br>
Cassius Clay when he refused to take the U.S. Army oath on 
April 28, of 1967.&quot;He__ No I wont't Go&quot;. The United States Government 
had (30) days to take action He stated he searched his conscience and said it 
was not true his beliefs. Those beliefs were the beliefs of the Black Muslins. 
They used the force of intimidation to sell you a trash paper called Muhammad 
Speaks. That was a method of financing the organization. You felt very 
intimidated when they approached you. Most of the in nice suits and black hats 
and bigger than most bouncers. Anyone really interested in knowing what he is 
about should read about the big shootout at 54th &amp; Broadway in Los Angeles 
Ca. Suddenly his name changed to Muhammad Ali. He now was facing to a maximum 
sentence of five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. I do not think he did 
either. I threw many of his Newsboys out of the store I worked in. Too me he is 
nothing but a Non-American. Malcom X has quite a history as well. I am old 
enough to say I lived in the area back then and know what I am talking about. 
Howard Cossel was his biggest publicity agent at that time. He could not say 
enough good thing about him. I do hope this &quot;Stings like a Bee&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a great story. Thanks for writing and running it.<br>
I was a huge 
Ali fan as a youth (I was born in 1958) and loved his artistry and bluster. We 
can knock Ali all we want for boorishness and rampant indulgence in fleshly 
pleasures during his career, but he has shown exceptional grace and dignity as 
he has moved into his maturity. I have never heard statements of bitterness or 
complaint as he has become imprisoned in his body through the years.</p> 
<p>Funny, but I never thought I would say that the most dignified boxer I can 
think of during my lifetime is Ali and the most respectable would be Larry 
Holmes, who seems like a solid citizen, watched his money and became a pillar 
of Easton PA.</p> </li> </ol>
