<h1>&quot;Smokin'&quot; Joe Frazier: The Death of the Disrespected</h1>  By 
Dave Zirin Print this article <br>

<p>The first African American man to address the South Carolina state 
legislature after the Civil War wasn't Booker T. Washington or W.E.B. DuBois or 
Dr. Martin Luther King. It was heavyweight boxing champion &quot;Smokin'&quot; 
Joe Frazier who died this week at the age of 67. Frazier had just emerged 
victorious from his epic 1971 encounter against Muhammad Ali, in a fight that 
was cast as a culture war between the &quot;draft dodger&quot; Ali and the 
&quot;establishment hero&quot; Joe Frazier. If you were against the war in 
Vietnam, you rooted yourself hoarse for Ali. If you wanted the hippies, freaks 
and Black Power disciples humbled, you wanted &quot;Smokin'&quot; Joe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the wake of Frazier's death much has been written that he didn't deserve 
this tag: that he was labelled unfairly as a &quot;sellout&quot; by Ali and 
suffered for it. It is certainly true that Ali and Frazier were friends before 
their conflicts consumed Frazier with fury. It's also true that when Ali was 
forced into exile for resisting the draft, it was Joe Frazier who gave Ali 
money when many others turned their backs on &quot;The Greatest.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ali said to Frazier, &quot;You just keep whupping those guys in the ring, 
and I'll keep fighting Uncle Sam and one day we'll make a lot of money 
together&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But by 1971, both men were playing their roles. Ali taunted Frazier for 
being an Uncle Tom. Frazier also, and less remembered, taunted Ali for being 
against the war.&nbsp; He said that because he loved America, he'd proudly 
fight in Vietnam. He also repeatedly insulted Ali by calling him by his 
birthname, &quot;Clay&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And then, after he whipped Ali in the &quot;fight of the century,&quot; Joe 
Frazier accepted that invitation to speak at the South Carolina legislature: a 
conquering hero.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of 13 children born in abject poverty in Beaufort, South Carolina, it's 
certainly understandable why he would accept the historic invite. But that 
doesn't make it any less of a full embrace of his role as the &quot;good 
one&quot; in the Ali-Frazier melodrama.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Speaking in a room with a confederate flag backdrop in front of a chamber 
with only three black representatives among its 170 elected officials, 
Frazier's message was gentle. He told jokes to great laughter about growing up 
in Beaufort and saying, &quot;Yes bawse and no bawse&quot; no matter the 
question.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He also said earnestly, &quot;We must save our people, and when I say 'our 
people' I mean white and black. We need to quit thinking about who drives the 
fanciest car or who is my little daughter going to play with, who is she going 
to sit next to in school. We don't have time for that.&quot; Then his own 10 
year old daughter, to great cheer stood and said, &quot;Float like a butterfly, 
sting like a bee. My daddy is the one who whipped Muhammad Ali.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While the chamber and national media swooned, Ali seethed. The beaten champ 
said Frazier was &quot;consorting with the enemy.&quot; He had, in Ali's eyes, 
become a hero to the very people who as a young man in South Carolina wouldn't 
have even spit in his direction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As the 1970s labored on, and the movements that thrived at the decade's 
inception began to wither, Ali's taunts toward Frazier became less political 
and more indefensible. When their epic 1975 fight in Manila loomed, Ali 
repeatedly called Frazier &quot;a gorilla.&quot; He spoke verses on how 
&quot;black and ugly&quot; Frazier was. For Ali, it was part of the show. For 
Frazier, it was more scarring than any punch in Ali's arsenal.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Years later, Ali commented, &quot;I said a lot of things in the heat of the 
moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called 
him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the 
fight&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Joe Frazier didn't want to hear apologies. In retirement he would express 
joy at any role he may have played in Ali's Parkinson's disease. When Ali 
famously lit the torch at the 1996 Olympics, Frazier expressed grief that he 
couldn't be there to shove Ali into the fires.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The roots of his anger were deeper than just anything uttered by Muhammad 
Ali. Joe Frazier was the 1964 Olympic Gold Medalist. He never dodged a draft. 
He never boasted of throwing his medal in the Ohio River. He never said 
&quot;God damn America.&quot; Yet there was Ali lighting the torch while he was 
stuck at home. The establishment had chosen the anti-hero, and Joe Frazier was 
cast merely as the foil and the fool.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It boggled Frazier's mind when his adopted home of Philadelphia put up a 
statue of a boxer, and chose the very fictional&mdash;and very 
white&mdash;Rocky Balboa as their favorite fighting son. He did things 
&quot;the right way&quot; and Philly gave him the back of their hand like they 
were just another &quot;bawse&quot; in Beaufort.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This shouldn't have been Joe Frazier's fate: the convenient hero of 
everyone who wanted to see Ali punished for his politics. This shouldn't have 
been Joe Frazier's fate: internalizing and nursing every barb from 
&quot;Gaseous Cassius&quot; instead of letting it roll off his back. This 
shouldn't have been Joe Frazier's fate: rejected by the same establishment so 
quick to embrace him when it suited their needs. &quot;Smokin' Joe&quot; 
deserved so much better.</p>

<p>Hmm, i didn't know about some of Frazier's actions during that time. I 
guess Ali was not being completely inaccurate in his characterization of 
Frazier. Though to be fair, who is the one who's been co-opted now?<br>
<br>

That statue of Rocky also left me dumbfounded. Great movie but it he is not a 
real boxer and the guy the movie is loosely based on (Chuck Wepner), Stallone 
financially stiff armed.<br>
<br>
For Smokin' Joe the lesson was: you lie down 
with dogs and you'll wake up with fleas.</p>  Posted by Johnnie Q on 11/10/11 
at 3:15 PM  Ali attended a Klan rally at the same time 
<p>Comrade Zirin takes Frazier to task for speaking to the South Carolina 
legislature-- which incidentally had more black legislators at the time than in 
New York.<br>
<br>
Yet Comrade Zirin ignores the fact that Ali attended a Ku 
Klux Klan rally to support racial separatism.<br>
<br>
Ali came from a 
solidly-middle class family in Louisville, who later became a slavish follower 
of the cult-like Nation of Islam. The NOI threatened Ali repeatedly, and feed 
him many of &quot;his&quot; best lines about those vietcong, etc.<br>
<br>

Watch HBO's Thrilla in Manila if you want a more realistic protrayal of their 
relationship than Zirin gives in his white-washed, commercialized-radical 
version of Ali.<br>

Greatest Love of All 
<p>This sad story just speaks to the complex nature of what it's like to be 
black in this society. In the end, the powers that be only love you to the 
extent they can use you and profit from you (you listening Magic Johnson). In 
1971, who would have thought it would end this way, Ali carrying the torch for 
good ole USA, Frazier kicked to the curb. The lesson for me is this: learning 
to love yourself is the greatest love of all. You can't expect to find your 
sense of worth and dignity from trying to please the master. You'll end up 
broken every time.</p>  Posted by Conspiracy Brother on 11/10/11 at 6:03 PM  
that is really sad... 
<p>and ironic. I can see why he &quot;chippy&quot;.</p>  Posted by ashley on 
11/10/11 at 10:05 PM  Ali/ Frazier 
<p>Ali was the consumate entertainer and at the same time one of the greatest 
sports figure the world has ever known.<br>
<br>
Centuries to come the world 
will still remember Ali and Frazier will only be remembered as the first man to 
beat Ali. Without Ali we would not even be talking about Frazier today. Ali 
made Frazier.<br>
<br>
Everyone is aware that Ali always berated his opponents 
to sell tickets to his fights. The man doesn't have a hateful bone in his body.
<br> <br>
However, Frazier always hated Ali for the things he said about him. 
Imagine his comment about pushing Ali in the flames when Ali lit the Olympic 
torch. If that not true hate, I don't know what is.<br>
<br>
The only reason 
Frazier was asked to speak to the South Carlonia legislature was because he 
beat Ali and they wanted Ali to be beaten so badly.<br>
<br>
Ali is a great 
human being. Ali and Frazier will be remembered for their three epic fights.<br>
<br>I can believe Ali's apologies to Frazier but I don't believe Frazier's 
apologies were sincere</p>  Posted by Chuck Mohan on 11/11/11 at 12:31 AM  
Smokin' Joe Frazier 
<p>What we see in the Frazier-Ali rivalry was that split that would develop in 
African American political thought, today pretty much represented by Herman 
Cain and Barack Obama. Seen from the eyes of the dominant culture Frazier was 
the flag waving accommodationist (&quot;our black&quot;) and Ali was the 
anti-war militant (&quot;their black&quot;). One deserved our praise, the other 
our contempt. Frazier must have been disheartened when he finally saw how 
history judged him.</p>  Posted by Floyd Davis on 11/11/11 at 12:49 AM  
Ali-Frazier 
<p>I learned some things I didn't know. <br>
<br>
Muhammad Ali, however was a 
truly great boxer and his refusal to fight in Vietnam where, 'no Vietnamese 
ever called him n---,' was the correct decision to make. The incorrect decision 
was made on the part of the state department and the country that stripped him 
of his title for his political beliefs. Joe Frazier's shift away from 
supporting Ali's actions is curious. I do not understand it. And what was 
worse, is that the effects of the controversy spilled over into the boxing 
careers of the daughters of both Men. This illustrates thoroughly how divisive 
political agendas can separate AFRIKAN people and any peoples who basically 
believe in freedom and empowerment. Just as a thought: Ancestor Geronimo ji 
Jaga Pratt served in the military as well. And he came back home and put his 
skills to good use, by becoming a member of the Black Panther Party and keeping 
many Afrikan people alive when J Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO 'counter 
intelligence' program sought to disrupt and dis-unify and kill everyone 
everyone from the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference to El Hajj Malik El Shabazz and the Organization of 
Afro-American Unity to the BPP. Ancestor Smokin' Joe Frazier should be 
remembered for his positive deeds and contributions to AFRIKAN people and to 
humanity. Muhammad Ali is being remembered for his. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE</p>

ugly 
<p>If one were to examine the influences upon one of America's inconic giants, 
i.e., MLK, Jr, one would realize his intellect and persona were informed by a 
slew of influences. They range from Nietzsche to Jesus Christ. Further 
examination reveals these influences run the gamut in terms of their attitudes, 
behavior, morals, and politics. In reflecting upon the life and times of 
Smokin' Joe Fraizer and Muhummad Ali (and his inevitable demise) let us never 
for forget that let &quot;he/she who is devoid of good, bad, and ugly 
aspects&quot; throw the first stone. RIP Joe Frazier &quot;AN AMERICAN 
HERO!&quot;</p>  Posted by Ron Stewart, Ph.D. on 11/11/11 at 11:36 AM  Head

<p>Ali killed Smokin Joe, Joe killed Ali....for the entertainmenet of the 
masses..</p>  Posted by pat kiefer on 11/12/11 at 1:44 AM  Ali-Frazier 
<p>Good article. Ali, however, didn't wait forJoe's talk at the legislature to 
insult him at a very embarrassing personal level. The &quot;uncle Tom&quot; 
indignity was thrown at Frazier prior to their '71 fight, and it was was 
tremendously scathing. His later attempts to &quot;promote&quot; their fights 
were even uglier and abusive. I can understand Frazier's hatred for Ali. Ali 
deserves it. And, you know, I like Ali; I just don't like him when I think 
about Frazier.</p>  Posted by Bruno Evangelista on 11/13/11 at 7:49 AM
