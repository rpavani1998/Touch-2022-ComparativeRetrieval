</p>
<p><b><i>Michael Flatley participates in UCD Law Society Debate on Boxing</i>
</b></p>
<p>On St. Patrick's Day in 1998, sports writer Pat Bigold stated in an article 
that when Michael Flatley exploded onto the scene, he personified a link 
between two of an Irishman's greatest passions: Sports and the Arts.</p>
<p><i>Excerpt:<br>
<br>
</i>Flatley possesses an undeniable appeal as a 
throwback to a simpler era when men were men, and they weren't so worried about 
their identity that they couldn't express themselves with style and artistry.
</p>
<p>Flatley does it with gusto and you can see the boxer's body english every 
time he steps on stage. Any kid who's ever had the word &quot;footwork&quot; 
drilled into him time and again ought to watch the &quot;Riverdance&quot; or 
&quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; videotapes in which Flatley performs to see how a 
boxer's feet can move. Check out the fight choreography in Lord of the Dance 
where Flatley, at 40-plus, makes you believe he could still go a strong five or 
six rounds. Right down to the antagonistic facial expressions he casts at his 
arch-rival, the guy still looks every inch a fighter.</p>

<p>Champion Irish dancer Michael Flatley was also a Golden Gloves Amateur 
Boxing champion in his youth, and often attends the matches of those he admires 
in the sport. Boxing is not without controversy, due to the encouragement of 
intentional violence and the high risk of brain injury in the sport, and was 
the subject of a debate at the University College Dublin's Law Society.</p>We 
thank Ann Keller (AnnMargaretKeller.com) for the following report of the 
evening.
<p>&#149; &#149; &#149;<br>
</p>
<p>On Thursday, January 15th, 2004 I was at UCD (University College, Dublin) 
to see Michael presented with Honourary Life Membership of the Law Society and 
take part in their boxing debate. Before the house was the proposal 'This house 
would ban boxing!' and about six or eight students spoke, plus guests Michael 
and a member of the British Boxing Board, Simon Block. He was a very dignified 
and eloquent gentleman and spoke very well and very informatively. Another 
guest, a doctor, was supposed to speak also, but didn't get there.<br>
<br>
The 
evening was not what was suggested by all the advertising, as I imagined a 
large crowd after all the hype through the week, several snippets in the press, 
even a TV announcement that morning, but the lecture theatre remained not 
filled and I doubt there were more than 50 people present, including about ten 
press photographers clicking away - not great for my little old tape recorder 
as one was right in front of it! I did miss an odd word that Michael said 
because of that, and also because he speaks so softly the audience had to 
almost hold its breath to catch all he said - and that they did! I don't think 
they were at all informed about him beforehand, maybe they had rashly invited 
him thinking he would never come! But if they thought that, they had no idea 
what a soft touch he is with the aspirations of young people! He just loves to 
help them and support them, and in fact he and Lisa had flown in specially for 
the evening and were flying straight on the New York early next morning. It was 
a lovely gesture that they both came, and I think that had sunk in to the 
organisers once they had met and talked to them, as the host of the evening 
came in to apologise for the delay starting (due to a 'media circus' in the 
hallway!) and said very warmly that he has just met and talked to Michael and 
what an extremely nice guy he was! Obviously he was not what they expected. 
Perhaps they expected him to be flamboyant and boisterous, as if he were 
onstage!<br>
<br>
When the event started, Michael walked in, no 
&quot;minders&quot; in evidence, and sat with Simon Block at the back of the 
platform, and Lisa took a front seat in the corner, also unaccompanied. Michael 
was all in black, looking very well, fit and tanned - I think he gets younger 
by the year, not older! - and Lisa looked very elegant in a shiny black suit 
with belted jacket and pencil skirt to the knee, very dainty high-heeled shoes, 
and of course the wonderful tumble of blonde hair around her shoulders. I 
especially admired her pendant, a beautifully simple, classy little diamond 
studded puffed heart on a short white gold (or platinum?!) chain. She is very 
tall and incredibly slim - in a contest, I think the Supermodels would run her 
a poor second! She looked lovely. And although I'm sure the evening was really 
very boring for her, she remained attentive throughout, and joined in the 
laughter as much as Michael, who seemed to genuinely enjoy it all thoroughly.
<br> <br>
Michael spoke at the end of the evening, after the other speakers, 
and was the only one no one interrupted as they could by the rules! The form 
was that the speaker was left alone for three minutes (a bell marked the time), 
then he could be questioned or commented to, and he spoke for a further five 
minutes altogether. All were interrupted save Michael, who had the house 
spellbound within seconds, though he appeared to be just casually talking, 
delivering the speech as smoothly as though it were regular conversation, and 
with no notes of any kind. He gave, in my view, a superb demonstration of 
really professional public speaking, very quiet and calm, speaking slowly 
enough to be followed by everyone, and forming complete and natural sentences. 
Yet he conveyed his passion and energy just the same. He only got one thing 
wrong as far as I was concerned - he referred to himself as 'uneducated 
compared to you youngsters'. He may not have a college degree, but he is 
without doubt one of the most educated and cultured people I have ever met.<br>

<br>After the speeches, the vote was taken and the motion to ban boxing 
defeated beyond doubt! Then the presentation was made, Michael receiving the 
simple scroll as graciously and warmly as though it were an Oscar! After that 
the audience were invited to ask questions, not just on boxing, and only then I 
think they began to open up, realising this man had a lot more to share than 
they had thought! Again, he was self-effacing, murmuring that he liked to 
&quot;play a little chess&quot; (that had been suggested as one better channel 
for young people's diversion!), and I was itching to jump up and tell them he 
is a Chess Master, but of course I didn't!<br>
<br>
The most interesting part 
of that section of the evening, for me, was when the Las Vegas casino project 
came up, because when Michael spoke about that it was very revealing. It became 
clear immediately to me 'why' he is doing it, which I think puzzles many 
people. This is not about personal gain, business growth of his empire, or 
celebrity, this is for the worldwide profile of Ireland. He is so passionate 
about promoting Ireland well, and giving its people new opportunities on the 
world stage in every area. He has seen many other countries represented by 
their magnificent hotel/casino projects on the Strip, and it has become his 
'almost impossible dream' to put Ireland there too, so all the Irish companies 
and artists can be showcased there with the world's best. His real joy is 
opening new worlds for upcoming generations; he has done it in dance, and now 
he is moving on to other areas. I came away from that evening thinking that 
even most of his most loyal fans have only partial concept of what an 
extraordinary and wonderful, giving man he is. And I truly believe he has only 
just begun to show the world what he can achieve.<br>
<br>
At the end, the 
audience came down to have posters of the Law Society, scraps of paper, 
anything, signed, just to get to talk to him close-up! He and Lisa both chatted 
to all who came to them, and they must have been there near half an hour, 
totally informal and delightfully relaxed. I had the pleasure of chatting to 
Lisa while he was signing, and she was so sweet, very natural and softly and 
gently spoken, radiating the same warmth and sparkle from her eyes as Michael 
does. When I spoke to Michael I told him I was sorry not to be able to go to 
New York for the PBS show, but friends of mine were going and I knew he would 
have good people there. He thanked me for coming to that night, and said he was 
looking forward to meeting everyone at the PBS show. I asked if they had had a 
nice Christmas and they said yes, it had been lovely, very relaxing, and it was 
so good to just stop and pause after all the travel of 2003, when they just 
seemed to be constantly jetlagged.<br>
<br>
Finally, after one more photo call, 
the theatre emptied, Michael and Lisa left with the evening's host and one or 
two other people, and I and the friend who had come with me, headed out into 
the hideously windy, dark and wet Irish night and found our way to the car park 
to go home! It had been a most unusual evening, which I had to play the tape of 
to believe it really happened!</p>
<p>&#149; &#149; &#149;</p>
<p><b>Transcript of Michael's remarks:</b><br>
</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I appreciate you asking me here to speak, although I'm 
not sure after hearing everything I've just heard that I can add anything 
valuable to help you make your decision, but I'll do my best. I'm very 
uneducated compared to you youngsters. I grew up in Chicago, in a tough 
neighbourhood. I didn't really give much thought, when my father dragged me off 
to boxing lessons, whether or not it was going to be harming me or helping me, 
but I do know that going to school every day I was in fist fights, and they're 
no fun! And they exist today the same as when I was a kid, whether you like it 
or not you're going to be involved in some of these things from time to time, 
or you're at least going to be around that kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Boxing gave 
me confidence. I was a small, skinny white kid in a mostly Black and Mexican 
neighbourhood, and I got picked on. I learned how to fight and it gave me a 
little confidence on the inside, and I daresay it saved me in a lot of 
different situations. I look back on that time as being a very good time in my 
life, and you know, there's a lot said about the dangers of boxing, and you're 
right. I mean, I've really argued with myself on this point. It is a dangerous 
sport, but there's a lot of dangerous sports. When you decide to step into the 
ring against another man, and you know that when you're there you're going to 
cause some damage, so is he, he's trying to take your head off, that's part of 
it. As you jump out of that plane (sky-diving) you've made that decision then, 
that you may get hurt. You could have to face something a lot more dangerous 
than just somebody's right hand when you hit the ground. If you're in business, 
you look at this, look at the sheer numbers, it doesn't matter that one guy is 
hitting the other guy or how the death occurs, the death occurs. And if the 
numbers are more in one sport than the other sport, then we need to back up and 
ask ourselves, why are we not looking for a ban in those other sports? And why 
do we isolate boxing?</p>
<p>I tend to agree with things that were said on both sides tonight certainly, 
but the truth is, people have basketballs to turn to, or chess, but they didn't 
turn to that, because they really wanted to box, and freedom of choice is 
freedom of choice, and that's a really important thing to remember. They didn't 
turn to basketball, they wanted to box, and if we didn't have boxing we 
wouldn't today have Muhammad Ali in that position, because he chose that 
because he loved it. He did try other things, but he ended up in boxing and he 
was poetry in motion, in the sport that he loved. Sugar Ray Leonard, one of the 
greatest businessmen in America today, was a champion, superstar boxer, and 
there's nothing wrong with his brain, he's a sharp guy. We wouldn't have Barry 
McGuigan, Wayne McCullough, Michael Carruth, Steve Collins, and other of other 
Irish heroes, people that I would certainly consider to be Irish heroes. I was 
there when McGuigan fought (Taylor?) in King's Hall in Belfast, and, you know, 
my parents are Irish and I had so much pride bursting out of me I couldn't 
contain myself!</p>
<p>Now, boxing, like other combative sports, has been around since the Greeks 
and the Romans and the Games, and it's still around today. The difference is 
today they have to wear sixteen-ounce gloves, they don't fight with their bare 
fists, there is precaution, there are doctors there -- I know it's not 'Oh, the 
doctor's going to save everything!', obviously not, but we're all adults and we 
all understand that that can't be the case, you know. But I will say, from a 
young man's point of view, and I particularly admired Nicholas here, because 
here's a young man who's actually had the experience, he's been there, he can 
actually talk from (the point of view of) a man who's been in the ring and 
knows the feeling. He's put in the hours, he's done the training. When you're 
in the boxing ring, the hardest, most difficult climb in the world is the steps 
into that ring, it's the biggest mountain you will ever climb, the first time 
you do that. And when you're in there, your manager isn't there, your Mom and 
Dad aren't there to rescue you, and you quickly learn that you must prepare if 
you're going to get into that boxing ring. It is so important that you're 
prepared, So yes, you experience pain, that's the choice I made, I didn't quit 
after my first fight, most fighters don't, of course -- but there's pain in 
life, there's pain in everything. If you run away from pain you can go quit 
right now. There is some great quality to boxing, and whether you admit this or 
not, it does serve the minorities well. There were a lot of Irish people who 
had no money that made their name, back to Jack Dempsey and people like that 
who made great names for themselves, and made it to the top of the world with 
boxing. It's not all bad.</p>
<p>I can understand why some people would want to ban boxing, because of the 
way it's perceived and the way it looks. Certainly the match-making in America, 
in my opinion, is suspect -- I mean, I'm not a big fan of Don King, for 
instance, and those kind of fellas. I think the most chances ever taken in 
boxing is when you have eighteen or nineteen different governing bodies -- as a 
result you've a great fighter who's got a fabulous record, wants to pick up a 
few titles, goes down to this UBFF and he fights a guy who maybe had nine 
fights and no real competition, so he's mismatched, but the promoter, in that 
particular instance, maybe doesn't care. He wants to pick up the belt and get 
the big money fight. I know, that's the danger of the game. It would be a much 
fairer game, as far as I'm concerned, if we brought it back to one governing 
body, and we had more weight classes. I certainly think there should be a 
super-heavyweight division today, and I certainly think as well there should be 
an over-thirty class, and an over-forty class for older fighters, rather than 
throwing them in with the young tigers, just to get eaten alive because they've 
a got a big name and they're good pay-in. That is certainly, you know, the 
wrong thing to do, so I did take -- I listened very carefully to what all the 
speakers had to say, and I would tend to agree that there are changes to be 
made, but please, I think it would be really wrong to consider banning boxing 
completely. I mean, I'm sure there are a lot more dangerous sports, even in 
martial arts that I heard you talk about earlier. I looked at the stats myself, 
and just what you said about the people in the thousands in the different 
sports and how many lives are lost, you're absolutely right, I looked at that 
myself, but there's eighty deaths every single day in the United States from 
handgun murders, and certainly that should take a lot more of our time. I know 
that's not specifically why we're here today, but there are more important 
things than this sort of sport, and I think, all in all, if you weigh up the 
balance, boxing has done a lot more good than it's done bad. I believe it's 
much better today than it was before, even with a few bum promoters, and I 
would shudder to think what Mike Tyson would have done in his life had he not 
had boxing to turn to, and Cus D'Amato, the guy who pulled him off the street 
and helped him out... I wonder where I would have been today if I'd just held 
grudges against the guys who used to bloody my nose going to school, if I 
didn't face the music, go in and learn from a professional, how to defend 
myself against someone who was bigger and stronger, and come out and feel like 
a champion? Would I have even tackled any of the stuff I tackled? I don't know, 
I can't say. But for my money, I think boxing is good!<br>

<p><b>Questions &amp; Answers at UCD debate:<br>
<br>
</b><br>
<i>Q: I'm 
curious about how you made the changeover between boxing and dancing?</i></p>
<p>Michael - with a mischievous grin: Well at the time it seemed a lot safer!
</p>
<p>(Much laughter from the audience. He added something else but the laughter 
drowned it out.)</p>
<p><i>Q: Did boxing help you with contract negotiations for dancing at all?</i>
</p>
<p>Michael (still with a twinkle): No, I seemed to come out on the losing end 
of those mostly - (Again, much laughter!) - but I have other qualities!</p>
<p><i>Q: I was just wondering, in terms of everything, you take an interest in 
all the aspects of performing and show life, dance, choreography, direction, 
production, what's your favourite part of it?</i></p>
<p>Michael: I think the whole picture. You know, we did a lot of talking 
tonight about chess, and I like to play a little bit of chess, and even though 
I can't do it very well I've learned an awful lot about it, I've learned a lot 
about life. It's not just about one piece, or two pieces, and the same is true 
of boxing. You have to have offence and defense, and the same thing is true in 
my shows. There's that old saying that you have to share, everyone needs to 
have their input into the show, and the truth is it would be a dog's breakfast 
if I'd let that happen. You need to focus and you need to have the picture in 
your head, and whatever you decide in your own mind about boxing, or about your 
own careers, if you hear of some young man today that has a dream to become the 
next middleweight champion of the world, you should never deny him that dream 
because he may not know any other dream, and whatever your dream is, it's 
something that you should pursue to the end. Take the time, learn about it, 
every aspect of it - I love every aspect of my business, you know, I've had the 
hard times, I've been knocked down a few times as you all know, and I've made a 
lot of mistakes, probably more than all of you together will ever make... 
(chuckles from the audience)... but I learned from them, that's the key. Dumb 
and all as I am, I learned from them, and I got back up and I figured a way 
through it. I don't know anything about debate, obviously, these other lads are 
much more proficient than you and I are (looking at Simon Block, from the 
British Boxing Board), but I like to take the advice of people who know, but 
this young man (indicating student speaker Nicholas, the amateur boxer who 
spoke in the debate) is a fighter and I would take his viewpoint, certainly on 
this particular subject. And in my business I'll take advice from people, but I 
think it's important that you try everything, learn how it is, make sure you 
know your business, anyone that's going into the Arts. You're a fool today if 
you don't understand the business side of it as well, you need to protect 
yourself and believe in yourself, and only follow what's in your heart.</p>
<p>(Big round of applause for this response)</p>
<p><i>Q: I've heard stories you're building some sort of casino and I just 
wondered how that's going, and does it mean that you're giving up the dancing 
and it's a new phase now?</i></p>
<p>Michael: Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're... it's kind of almost 'an 
impossible dream', but you know nothing is impossible. It's not the business I 
want to get into, I'm not a builder, and I'm not really a businessman per se, 
although I can fake my way through most of it, but it's a dream, and even 
though it's a daydream, it's a dream that I've had for a long time. I think 
that with any luck there'll be younger, smarter minds than me that will help 
bring it to fruition, but Ireland deserves a place on that Strip in Las Vegas, 
and... you know, it deserves that spot. All the other nationalities seem to be 
represented there, and I don't see why we shouldn't be represented there and my 
thought is that people are going to gamble anyhow, they're going to go there 
for fun anyhow, and I think it's not wrong that Ireland should have a part of 
that and play for it. I don't know if I'll be giving up dancing, you know, time 
will tell, I'm sure, but it's closing up.</p>
<p><i>Q: Will you do a dance for us? (Much laughter!)</i></p>
<p>Michael: I don't know how to dance, I never learned!<br>
<br>
Audience 
member: - Maybe Sean (host) will do it?<br>
<br>
Sean: I don't like to... I 
mean it would be rude to out-stage one of our guests.' (More laughter, and a 
round of applause, not least from Michael!)</p>
<p><i>Q: Have you any news about the show in South Africa?</i></p>
<p>Michael: Yes, we've sold out to the last ticket, in advance, record time, 
so I'm delighted about that.</p>
<p><i>Q: And what about the invitation to participate?</i></p>
<p>Michael: Yeah, you know my schedule doesn't permit for me to go down there 
right now, I've to go to New York tomorrow morning and do a lot of stuff. The 
next three months will be very trying, but if we can sneak a day I'll go down 
there and do what I can, but at least we're proud that we're giving some of the 
profits to the right causes down there. And we opened in Taiwan this morning, 
and we'll be in Dubai by the end of the week, so we're opening new territories, 
and you know, bad and all as we are, we're bringing Irish culture to parts of 
the world that haven't experienced it.</p>
<p><i>Q: Which was the greatest fight you've ever seen?</i></p>
<p>Michael: Oh, that's a great one! Ahh, well I loved - there's many great 
fights, from my point of view, Hagler/Hearns is one of the most exciting fights 
I've ever seen, certainly... One fight that intrigued me was the last fight 
between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, mainly because it made me wonder about 
the mindset of both men, and the distance they had come in their lives and 
their careers, as fighters and as men. They fought, really, incredibly well 
over the fourteen rounds, but when the bell rang for the fifteenth round, only 
one fighter got off his stool, so what was the difference? - whether it was 
boxing or whatever it was for, what was the difference between Muhammad Ali and 
Joe Frazier? Why did one guy stand up to fight that one last round and the 
other guy just said 'No, I can't.' And it wasn't a matter of boxing, they both 
took, you know, in fairness, a good beating that night, but one guy had 
something special inside, and I for one am glad that I was alive to see that 
moment, to see so much courage coming out of one person. He would emerge as a 
champion in any given role that he did, but thank God he had somewhere to make 
use of his talents, and I think that was one of the greatest fights ever.<br>
