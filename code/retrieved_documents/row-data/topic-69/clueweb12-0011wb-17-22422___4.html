<h1>Obama wins big in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire</h1> Published by Fred Soto
&bull; November 4th, 2008 RSS News Feed 
<p>Alright, dozens of states have been called, but here are a couple of states 
that matter.</p> 
<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong><br>
 The McCain camp has been saying all 
along that in order for it to have a chance to win this election, it must take 
Pennsylvania. Well, the bad news for John McCain is in,Barack Obama has taken 
Pennsylvania. It is unbelievable, given what we&rsquo;ve seen in the last two 
elections, but this fight may be over very early tonight. Congratulations to 
Obama on the big Pennsylvania victory.</p> 
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong><br>
New Hampshire also selected Barack Obama
, a state that tends towards independent thinking and many thought would favor 
the &ldquo;maverick&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Again, kudos to the Obama campaign and although I was pretty certain that 
Obama would take the night, the fact that it is over and done with this early 
is a tribute to a powerful Obama campaign.</p> <b>tags:</b> Elections, McCain,
