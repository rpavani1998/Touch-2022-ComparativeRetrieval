<h2>Reading the Greek New Testament</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 30, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Books, Spiritual Discipline 
</p> 
<p>Lee Irons has some good advice on Reading through the Greek New Testament 
year by year. He has even worked upa one year calendar for doing it. If anyone 
knows of similar resources for the Old Testament in Hebrew (and/or Greek), I 
would be grateful to know of them.</p> 
<p>He is also putting together syntactical notes on the Greek New Testament, 
which you can get to by scrolling downthis page until you see the heading 
&ldquo;Greek New Testament.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If you decide to read through the Greek New Testament, be careful. The 
things in that book got most of its authors killed, and when people have taken 
it seriously in the history of the church, crazy things likethe reformation 
have happened andsome folks even got themselves burned at the stake.</p> 
<p>The Greek New Testament is decidedly unsafe. If you embrace it, you will be 
hated (see John 15:18-20). To paraphraseLester De Koster: there it is, 
throbbing on your desk, the living word of God.</p>

<h2>Schreiner&rsquo;s New Testament Theology</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 29, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Books </p> 
<p>My copy of Thomas R. Schreiner&rsquo;s <em>New Testament Theology </em>
arrived last night, and I have been feasting on it with great delight! I cannot 
recommend this book highly enough. My advice is to quit reading this right now, 
go toAmazon.com, and order your copy at their 34% discounted price. Then come 
back and read the rest of this (since you have some time before your copy 
arrives. If you already have a copy, quit reading this post and crack open 
Schreiner&rsquo;s<em>New Testament Theology</em>&ndash;it will be a lot better 
for you than this post!).</p> 
<p>Those of you who are back from ordering your copy, while you&rsquo;re 
waiting for it to arrive, let me urge you to give yourself to the meditative 
reading of the Bible.</p> 
<p>In addition to that, let yourself enjoy a guided tour of the themes of New 
Testament Theology with one of with ablest interpreters of our times.</p> 
<p>C. S. Lewis once said that the best devotional books were the ones that 
seriously interpret the message of the Bible. He&rsquo;s right. And that means 
that Schreiner&rsquo;s<em>New Testament Theology</em> is not only, in the words 
of Simon Gathercole, &ldquo;A magnificent acheivement!&rdquo; in terms of its 
scholarship, it&rsquo;s also one of the best devotional books you could hope to 
find.</p> 
<p>G. E. Ladd&rsquo;s <em>A Theology of the New Testament</em> was published 
in 1974, and it has been the standard text on New Testament Theology since that 
time. In my opinion, the starting place for New Testament Theology is now 
Schreiner&rsquo;s volume rather than Ladd&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>I think every scholar, pastor, student, and Christian layman would do well 
to put this volume at the top of the summer reading list and enjoy!</p>

<h2>Andy Naselli on Keswick Theology</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 28, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Cultural Engagement, 
Evangelism and Apologetics, History, Spiritual Discipline </p> 
<p>Andy Naselli&rsquo;s first Ph.D. dissertation was on Keswick Theology 
(he&rsquo;s working on a second Ph.D. at Trinity), and he recently gave a
presentation at Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary that summarizes his 
dissertation. I found his summary and critique of the Keswick movement 
enormously helpful for sorting through the way that the Keswick view of 
sanctification has leavened itself all through evangelicalism.</p> 
<p>PS: I think Andy&rsquo;s blog is worth adding to your google reader and 
keeping an eye on. Enjoy!</p> 
<p>I would especially encourage pastors, students, and theologians to check 
out these lectures. Dr. Naselli has done us a great service in sifting through 
this material and presenting it in a humble, winsome way. He writes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Detroit Seminary is hosting the following resources from the lecture series:
</p> 
<p> 1. Handout<strong> </strong>(five-page PDF)</p> 
<p> 2. Power Point presentation as a PDF (eighty slides with lots of pictures)

of your nose? Boxing is my excuse. What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;<strong></strong>
</p>

enough.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Tommy Farr</strong>: &ldquo;Every time I hear the name Joe Louis my 
nose starts to bleed.&rdquo;<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>, when asked about his golf game: 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best. I just haven&rsquo;t played yet.&rdquo;<strong>
</strong></p>

prison for three years, not Princeton.&rdquo;<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Tex Cobb</strong>, responding to a reporter who said Cobb was a 
fat, cocaine snorting , drunk. Cobb replied: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fat.</p>

&ldquo;Standing across the ring from Joe Louis and knowing he wants to go home 
early.&rdquo;<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>George Foreman</strong>: &ldquo;The referee is the most important 
man in the ring besides the two fighters.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Ricardo Mayorga: </strong>I will knock out Vernon Forrest in two 
rounds whether I have a cigarette or not. I know a lot of people want to see me 
fight more rounds. So, if HBO wants, they can pick two sparring partners for me 
to fight after I knock out Forrest. That way, the audience can see me fight 12 
rounds.&rdquo;<br>

<h2>A Wedding Sermon</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 25, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Church, Marriage, Ministry 
</p> 
<p>Yesterday I had the great joy of preaching at a wedding for one of the guys 
in our church, who is also a student at SWBTS Houston. At the encouragement of 
a couple friends who were present, I&rsquo;m posting my remarks here. May the 
Lord be pleased to bless our marriages that we might be living pictures of the 
mystery of Christ and the church!</p> 
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p> 
<p>When God gave the woman to the man in the Garden of Eden, the words were 
pronounced, &ldquo;Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and 
hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh&rdquo; (Gen 2:24). The 
harmony enjoyed in Eden was soon lost when the couple sinned, and God said to 
the woman as he pronounced judgment, &ldquo;Your desire shall be for your 
husband, and he shall rule over you&rdquo; (Gen 3:16). That curse is the origin 
of all marital difficulty. That curse is the origin of feminism. That curse is 
the origin of males who sinfully &ldquo;rule over&rdquo; their wives in 
inappropriate ways. That curse came because of human sin, and that curse 
threatens to make marriage hopelessly impossible.</p> 
<p>What a depressing thing to say at a wedding!</p> 
<p>But we aren&rsquo;t hopeful about your marriage because we can make a joke 
and lighten the mood. We are hopeful about your marriage because when Jesus 
came, he died on the cross to pay the penalty for sin. His resurrection shows 
that he has triumphed over the curse. He has opened the way to life.</p> 
<p>All who trust in Jesus are justified before God and empowered to live in a 
new way, a way that is not doomed by the dreadful curse on sin.</p>

<h2>So, Aren&rsquo;t We All Cessationists? (at least on this point)</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 23, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Church, Ecclesiology, 
Spiritual Gifts </p> 
<p>I have been sitting on this post for a long time. My students have heard me 
make this argument in class, but I have been hesitant to post it. The main 
reason I haven&rsquo;t posted until now is my great respect for the 
continuationists at Sovereign Grace Ministries. Those guys are among the most 
humble, godly, joyful, loving people I&rsquo;ve ever met, and I don&rsquo;t 
mean any disrespect to them in this post. I disagree with them, though, and 
I&rsquo;m about to say why. Before I do, some caveats:</p> 
<p>First, my argument for cessationism is exegetical, but it is not tied to 
any statements in 1 Corinthians 13.</p> 
<p>Second, this argument is not tied to a particular form of either 
dispensational or covenant theology (I&rsquo;m in that overlapping middle that 
is sympathetic with both Progressive Dispensationalism and New Covenant 
Theology).</p> 
<p>Third, below I will lay out my argument. When I&rsquo;m done, I&rsquo;ll 
tell you what I think is the major defeater of my argument (in other words, 
I&rsquo;ll tell you how I would argue against this position if I were a 
continuationist), and then I&rsquo;ll tell you what (I think) defeats that 
defeater.</p> 
<p>Here goes:</p> 
<p>D. A. Carson has written,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As long as &lsquo;apostles&rsquo; are understood to refer to a 
select group (the Twelve plus Paul) whose positions or functions cannot be 
duplicated after their demise, there is a prima facie case for saying<em>at 
least one</em>of the cari,smata (<em>charismata</em>) passes away at the end of 
the first generation, a gift tightly tied to the locus of revelation that came 
with Jesus Messiah and related events&rdquo; (<em>Showing the Spirit</em>, 88).
</p> 
<p>I would define The Apostles that Carson describes as those who saw the 
risen Lord Jesus and were commissioned by him. This would seem to mean that The 
Apostles were the 12, with Matthias replacing Judas (Acts 1:15&ndash;26), James 
the Lord&rsquo;s brother (1 Cor 15:7; Gal 1:19), Paul (1 Cor 15:8-9), and maybe 
Barnabas (Acts 14:4, 14).</p> 
<p>The word &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; is also used in the NT to describe those who 
were &ldquo;sent out&rdquo; from the churches, and these instances are 
generally translated along the lines of &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; (see, e.g, 2 
Cor 8:23; Phil 2:25). If we were to follow the pattern of the NT on this point, 
we might call missionaries that we send out from our churches 
&ldquo;apostles,&rdquo; but we would always want to clarify that we don&rsquo;t 
mean Apostle in the way that Paul and Peter were Apostles. All we would mean is 
&ldquo;messenger,&rdquo; or perhaps, &ldquo;missionary.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Dave Harvey has written the Sovereign Grace book on <em>Polity </em>
(available free onlinehere), which I think has beneficial information, but I 
don&rsquo;t think the statement on &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; is helpful:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While Sovereign Grace Ministries heartily agrees that &lsquo;no one 
in the church today functions with the authority of the original 
apostles,&rsquo; let us not hastily extrapolate . . . to conclude that no one 
today functions as an apostle of any kind.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is helpful because it clearly says, &ldquo;We 
don&rsquo;t mean Apostle in the sense of Paul and the 12, but we still want to 
use the word as though some people today have the gift.&rdquo; The problem is, 
when Ephesians 4:11 says, &ldquo;He gave some as apostles,&rdquo; I think 
it&rsquo;s really hard to make that mean something other than &ldquo;Paul and 
the 12, James, Barnabas, and maybe Jude.&rdquo; Ephesians 3:5 refers to The 
Apostles as those to whom the revelation of the mystery was given, which seems 
to refer to the guys who wrote the other parts of the New Testament. Right 
before that, Ephesians 2:20 refers to The Apostles as foundational for the 
church. So it seems to me that The Apostles that Paul describes Jesus giving to 
the church in Ephesians 4:11 are this closed circle of men who saw the risen 
Lord and were commissioned by him (the twelve and the few others added after 
the resurrection).</p> 
<p>I understand the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; of &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; in both 
Ephesians 4:11 and 1 Corinthians 12:28 to be a gift of certain people. That is, 
I do not understand either verse to be referring to a &ldquo;skill set&rdquo; 
of apostleship, but to certain men who were given to the church as The Apostles.
</p> 
<p>It seems to me that, in the passage cited above, Harvey concedes that the 
gift of Apostle has ceased, but then wants to say that something similar to it 
continues. But if that&rsquo;s what the gift means, we might all be 
continuationists!</p> 
<p>But we&rsquo;re not really continuationist on this point. The real 
continuationists are those who conduct themselves as though the gift of Apostle 
hasn&rsquo;t ceased, and there are at least two groups who behave as though it 
does: Roman Catholics and Mormons. For the Roman Catholics, tradition and the 
Pope&rsquo;s ex cathedra statements are as authoritative as Scripture. The 
Mormons also claim to have new revelation that is on the level of Scripture.</p>
<p>It seems to me that any group that holds to a closed canon thinks that the 
gift of Apostle has ceased (I have argued the same point regarding prophecyhere
). Those who think the canon is closed and call themselves 
&ldquo;charismatic/continuationist&rdquo; on this point can only do so because 
they have redefined the terms.</p> 
<p>Perhaps an analogy would be helpful here. I think this would be like me 
re-defining what it means to be an Arminian and then claiming to be 
one&ndash;after all, I do think that people have free will! Let me put it in a 
way that corresponds with Harvey&rsquo;s statement above: &ldquo;While we agree 
that free will as the Arminian typically understands it does not exist, let us 
not hastily extrapolate that there is no such thing as free will of any 
kind.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Would it work for me to announce, &ldquo;Therefore, I believe in free will, 
and I will call myself an Arminian.&rdquo; Is this helpful in the discussion? 
Wouldn&rsquo;t a real Arminian object to the way that I have co-opted their 
language?</p> 
<p>So it seems to me that everyone who thinks that there are no more Apostles 
like Peter and Paul thinks that at least one spiritual gift has ceased. It 
seems, then, that this discussion is simply over the degree of cessationism 
that we hold, because anyone who holds that there is no one in the church today 
with the same kind of authority possessed by Peter and Paul believes that the 
gift of Apostle has ceased. In conclusion, it appears to be the case that, at 
least as it regards the gift of Apostleship, all protestants are really 
cessationists. If they are not, they can, in principle, add to the New 
Testament.</p> 
<p>One final tongue in cheek comment: if we had an apostle or a genuine 
prophet today, wouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to settle some of the thorny 
issues that divide protestant Christians into denominations? For instance, 
wouldn&rsquo;t an Apostle or a Prophet be able to tell those paedo-baptists to 
quit sprinkling their babies and join up with the Baptists!?</p> 
<p><strong>A Possible Defeater</strong></p> 
<p>If I wanted to maintain the continuationist position, I would argue that 
the term &ldquo;Apostles&rdquo; cannot be limited to this &ldquo;closed circle 
of men&rdquo; (the twelve minus Judas plus Matthias, Paul, Barnabas, James, and 
maybe Jude) described in the New Testament. One text (which my friend Denny 
Burk pointed out to me) that might open up the circle of The Apostles is 1 
Corinthians 15:7, where after saying that Jesus appeared to the twelve in 15:5, 
Paul says that Jesus appeared to James and &ldquo;all the apostles.&rdquo; This 
text could be taken to mean that &ldquo;The Apostles&rdquo; refers to a broader 
group than those named above. Incidentally, those who think that Junia is both 
female and an Apostle (Rom 16:7) also think there are more apostles than those 
I have named.</p> 
<p><strong>Answering the Defeater</strong></p> 
<p>I think it likely that Paul mentions the twelve in 1 Corinthians 15:5 and 
then mentions &ldquo;all the apostles&rdquo; in 15:7 because The Apostles is a 
broader group than merely the twelve. One member of this broader group has been 
named in the previous phrase in 15:7, James. I am inclined to think that the 
reference to &ldquo;all the apostles&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 15:7 is a 
reference to all those who make up this group of fifteen or sixteen men (the 
twelve including Matthias, James, Jude?, Barnabas, and according to 1 
Corinthians 15:8, Paul). I think that Paul is saying that Jesus the Risen Lord 
appeared to them and commissioned them.</p> 
<p>With D. A. Carson, I think that The Apostles are a closed circle and that 
when those men died the foundation of the church had been laid and the gift of 
Apostle ceased.</p>

<h2>The Tie: Understanding Scripture in Light of Christ</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 23, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Messiah in the OT, Messianism
,OT in the NT </p> 
<p>The spring issue of the Southern Seminary magazine, The Tie, has just 
appeared online, and it takes up the question of reading the Bible 
Christologically. You cansubscribe to the magazine for free, and I think you 
ought to do so and ask them to send you a copy of the current issue.</p> 
<p>The current issue is now online, and it has essays from Stephen Wellum, 
Russell Fuller, and myself on how the whole Bible preaches Christ, David 
Powlison writes on how to center counseling on Christ, Russ Moore shows us how 
to go beyond the Veggie Tales Gospel (you have to readthis) to preach Christ 
ourselves, and David Prince gives us an example of preaching Christ from 
Judges. And there&rsquo;s more. Check it out online, subscribe right away, and 
may the Lord use this magazine to help us fix our eyes on Jesus!</p> 
<p>&ndash;my short piece deals with how the authors of the New Testament 
understand the Old Testament.</p> 
<p>Here is the text:</p> 
<p><strong>The Interpretation of the Old Testament in the New </strong></p> 
<p>One sometimes hears people express a desire to know exactly what Jesus said 
to the two men on the road to Emmaus following His resurrection. But if one 
wants to know how Jesus interpreted the Old Testament on the road to Emmaus, 
the easiest way to find out is to read the New Testament. This point is so 
important that its central implication needs to be made explicit: the New 
Testament indicates that its authors understand themselves to be reading the 
Old Testament the way that Jesus read the Old Testament.Continue Reading &rarr;

<p>The third post in Dr. Finn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Unplugged&rdquo; series is up, 
and it gives a fascinating look at the North Carolina Baptist State Convention. 
Every young Southern Baptist should read it for the encouragement (and for 
another opportunity to thank God for the way he has used Paige Patterson to 
lead Bible believing people to reclaim their institutions).</p> 
<p>Prof Finn also has some comments on cessationism that have prompted me to 
go forward with a post I&rsquo;ve been sitting on for some time, trying to 
decide whether or not to put it up. I&rsquo;m finally going to post my claim 
that we&rsquo;re all really cessationists. Stay tuned. . .</p>

<h2>Rodney Stortz on Daniel</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 22, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Books, Evangelism and 
Apologetics, History </p> 
<p>I am preaching through Daniel right now at Baptist Church of the Redeemer, 
and that enterprise drew my attention toRodney Stortz, who wrote the Preaching 
the Word volume on Daniel.</p> 
<p>I was inspired by the account of Stortz&rsquo;s life, and I am not alone. 
He died well, and being dead, he still speaks.</p> 
<p>I might not agree with every conclusion reached in this commentary (though 
thinking through someone else&rsquo;s conclusions has its own value), but I 
agree with the passion for evangelism and the commitment to expository 
preaching exemplified by Rodney Stortz.</p> 
<p>May the Lord make us all faithful to the end.</p>

<h2>Nathan Finn Unplugged on the SBC</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 21, 2008 in Cultural Engagement, History, Reformation and 
Revival </p> 
<p>I very much enjoyed Prof Nathan Finn&rsquo;s address at the recent Building 
Bridges Conference, and I&rsquo;m glad to see that he is now giving straight 
answers toquestions younger leaders are asking.</p> 
<p>These questions are a helpful window into what students at Southeastern 
College are thinking about, and Dr. Finn gives respectful, informed, frank, and 
encouraging responses.</p> 
<p>The first question deals with the recent IMB regulations, and the second 
takes upthe future of SBC calvinism. I&rsquo;ll be tuning in for future posts.
</p> 
<p>May the Lord help us to honor him by talking to one another in an edifying, 
straightforward, and loving way about the real issues facing our convention.</p>

<h2>History of the Institute for Biblical Research</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 20, 2008 in For God's Glory in Christ by the Spirit </p> 
<p>Something took me to the Institute for Biblical Research&rsquo;s website 
yesterday, and I was delighted to see that back issues of the<em>Bulletin for 
Bibilcal Research</em> are online through 2005. I&rsquo;ll link to some of my 
favorite<em>BBR</em> articles from years past in a subsequent post, but this 
post is on a most interesting essay from the founder of IBR.</p> 
<p>At the twentieth anniversary of the society in 1993, Earle Ellis recounted 
the history of IBR and his hopes for its future:</p> 
<p>E. EARLE ELLIS, &ldquo;Institute for Biblical Research 1973-1993 Prologue 
and Prospects,&rdquo; Bulletin for Biblical Research 4 (1994) 35-40. [&copy; 
1994 Institute for Biblical Research]</p> 
<p>This is a fascinating window into the history of the organization from the 
persepective of its founder, and an appendix to Ellis&rsquo;s remarks gives his 
original letter from 1970 inviting people to meet together at SBL that year to 
discuss what has become the Institute for Biblical Research.</p> 
<p>For those who, like me, did not live this history (I was in college in 
1993) but are now Fellows of IBR, this essay gives us insight into the 
intentions and aims of its founders.</p> 
<p>Praise God for the work of Earle Ellis!</p>

<h2>Review of Bell, The Irrevocable Call of God</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 19, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Books, History </p> 
<p>Richard H. Bell, <em>The Irrevocable Call of God: An Inquiry into 
Paul&rsquo;s Theology of Israel</em>, WUNT. T&uuml;bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005. 
xxv + 550pp. ISBN: 3-16-148009-0. $175.00. Cloth.</p> 
<p>Published in <em>Bulletin for Biblical Research</em>, 18.1 (2008), 161-64.
</p> 
<p>Having noted his shift in persuasion from the &ldquo;new perspective&rdquo; 
to a &ldquo;more traditional &lsquo;Lutheran&rsquo; approach&rdquo;in his 
preface (VII), Richard Bell plunges straightway into a discussion of 
Paul&rsquo;s birth, upbringing and education. The reader must deduce for 
himself what Bell&rsquo;s thesis is and how the format of the material makes 
his argument.</p> 
<p>Bell&rsquo;s aim appears to be to establish his conclusion, deal with 
material that counters his conclusion, and apply his conclusion to recent 
history (the Holocaust) and the contemporary scene (various charges of 
anti-Semitism). Bell concludes regarding Israel that &ldquo;the whole nation, 
including every single member&rdquo; will be saved by faith in Jesus at his 
second coming (261-65). Moreover, he argues that &ldquo;Israelites from every 
age will believe in the Christ when they see him coming again in his 
glory&rdquo; (265).</p>

<h2>A New Ministry: SBTS in the Fall</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 12, 2008 in Church, History, Ministry </p> 
<p>In God&rsquo;s great mercy I will be joining the faculty of The Southern 
Baptist Theological Seminary in the fall. Here&rsquo;sthe story in the Towers 
Online.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I said when I shared this news with our church family at 
Baptist Church of the Redeemer:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Psalm 139:16, &ldquo;Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were 
written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there 
was none of them.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Psalm 139:16 tells us that every day of our lives is written in God&rsquo;s 
book before they come to pass. God is sovereign over every day of our lives.</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Acts 17:26, &ldquo;And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live 
on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the 
boundaries of their dwelling place . . .&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Acts 17:26 is describing nations, and it states that God has determined how 
long a nation will exist and what its boundaries will be. I think the same is 
true of individuals: God has determined how long we will live on this earth and 
what the boundaries of our dwelling place will be.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Ephesians 2:10, &ldquo;For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus 
for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in 
them.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Ephesians 2:10 tells us that God has prepared beforehand good works for us 
to do.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>2 Timothy 2:4, &ldquo;No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since 
his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>2 Timothy 2:4 tells us that Christian ministers are like soldiers. Soldiers 
receive orders, and they obey, seeking to please their superiors.</p> 
<p>The circumstances of our lives have made clear that new orders have been 
given to me.</p> 
<p>It has been a high privilege to serve Southwestern Seminary for the past 5 
years. The students have been eager to learn, encouraging to me, and what a joy 
to see them enter the harvest! The administration has been generous to me, 
always showing a sincere pastoral love, and God blessed me with dear friends in 
my faculty colleagues.</p> 
<p>It has also been an unexpected, unlooked for joy and privilege to serve at 
Baptist Church of the Redeemer for the last three years. I never intended to 
get swept up in a church plant, but God blessed us immensely through this group 
of families who wanted to plant a church. We are so grateful that we were drawn 
into this endeavor. We have never been happier at a church than we are at 
Redeemer. We have learned and continue to learn from our brothers and sisters, 
and I am spurred on by their godliness and devotion. What a privilege to serve 
such a people!</p> 
<p>I would be a fool to choose to leave.</p> 
<p>But it has not ultimately come down to my choice. Months of thinking over 
and praying through this possibility have made me certain that ifThe Southern 
Baptist Theological Seminary invited me to join the faculty, it would be the 
call of God to leave Houston and move to Louisville to labor in a different 
section of the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard.</p> 
<p>God has opened this door and has called us to this new ministry. We are sad 
to leave home, family in Texas, and most of all our church, but at the same 
time we are excited about what the Lord has for us.</p> 
<p>Lord willing, I will take up the post of Associate Professor of Biblical 
Theology at Southern in the Fall of 2008. I am humbled and honored to have the 
opportunity to serve in this role. May the Lord prosper his Word!</p> 
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p> 
<p>On a logistical note, if anyone is looking to buy a house in southwest 
Houston, let&rsquo;s talk!</p>

<h2>Let Athanasius Spur You to Study the Psalms</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 11, 2008 in Bible and Theology, Books, History, Messiah in 
the OT, Messianism </p> 
<p>In his fascinating lecture on &ldquo;Reading the Psalms Messianically
,&rdquo; Gordon Wenham recommendsThe Letter of St. Athanasius to Marcellinus on 
the Interpretation of the Psalms.</p> 
<p>Having followed that recommendation, I am now passing it on, and I would 
also recommend having a listen (or multiple listens) to Wenham&rsquo;s lecture. 
The most striking thing, for me, about Athanasius&rsquo;s letter is his 
absolutely thorough knowledge of the Psalms! What a gift to be spurred on to a 
closer and more comprehensive knowledge of the Psalms!</p> 
<p>Enjoy.</p> 
<p>By the way, if you have the SVS Press edition of Athanasius&rsquo;s <em>On 
the Incarnation</em> (the one with the brilliant introduction by C. S. Lewis), 
the letter to Marcellinus on the interpretation of the Psalms is included as an 
appendix.</p>

<h2>1 &amp; 2 Peter and Jude by David R. Helm</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 6, 2008 in For God's Glory in Christ by the Spirit </p> 
<p>Great preaching is inspiring. When I hear or read great preaching, it makes 
me want to preach. I often benefit from listening to inspiring preaching in my 
car on the way to school to teach&ndash;listening to John Piper fires me up, 
reminds me of all that is at stake, points me to the greatness of God&rsquo;s 
mercy in Christ, and stimulates my thinking. All of this makes me eager to 
serve God&rsquo;s people with urgent love for them and the Lord Jesus by 
proclaiming the Bible to them and praying the Lord to send the Spirit to set it 
on fire.</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned recently, if you&rsquo;re preaching or teaching a 
particular book, it is a great help to have your thoughts stimulated by someone 
else&rsquo;s efforts to preach that part of Scripture.</p> 
<p>The latest installment of the Preaching the Word commentary series arrived 
on my doorstep last night, and when I read the first two or three sermons in 
this volume, they made me want to preach! Praise God for the help in good 
books! Anyone preaching, teaching, or studying 1 Peter, 2 Peter, or Jude should 
get their hands onthis book to have the soil of the mind fertilized by the able 
proclamation modeled for us by David Helm.</p> 
<p>You may know David Helm from his work on <em>The Big Picture Story Bible
</em>&ndash;if you have kids and don&rsquo;t have <em>The Big Picture Story 
Bible</em>, you need to buy it right now and enjoy it with your children. Helm 
is also the executive director ofThe Simeon Trust, which Kent Hughes described 
when Mark Deverinterviewed him.</p> 
<p>I would also request that those of you who are in the habit of asking the 
Lord to bless things would beseech him to help me as I work on the commentary 
on Revelation for this series. If you happen to hear me preach sometime in the 
next few years, chances are it will be on Revelation, and Lord willing those 
sermons will take their place among the other volumes in the Preaching the Word 
series.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Narrow&rdquo; on Wednesday Night in Beaumont</h2> 
<p> by JMH on May 5, 2008 in Gospel, Ministry, Sermon Audio, Worship </p> 
<p>Lord willing, this Wednesday night &ndash; May 7, 2008 &ndash; I&rsquo;ll 
be speaking at &ldquo;Narrow,&rdquo; which meets at Westgate Memorial Baptist 
Church in Beaumont, TX (6220 Westgate Dr, Beaumont, TX, 77706). The event is a
