<h1>PHP vs. ASP &ndash; Which Is Best For Your Application?</h1>  Posted in:

<p>PHP (Pre Hypertext Processor) and ASP (Active Server Pages) are the two 
most popular means for building web applications. Many people believe that 
these two programming languages could be used interchangeably. And while they 
are each capable of building applications with the same functionality, there 
are some noteworthy differences between the two.</p> 
<p>The most noteworthy differences include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>price</li> 
<li>platform compatibility</li> 
<li>developer community</li> 
<li>speed</li> </ul> 
<h2>Price</h2> 
<p>There is a very large difference between PHP and ASP in terms of price. PHP 
is free. On the other hand,ASP requires both initial and ongoing costs for 
maintenance and debugging. Furthermore, any additionalASP libraries will also 
come with a price tag.</p> 
<h2>Platform Compatibility</h2> 
<p>PHP runs on multiple platforms, both Linux Apache and Windows IIS. Only 
recently have some versions ofASP been able to run on other platforms. So if 
you are looking for maximum platform compatibility, it is best to opt forPHP.
</p> 
<h2>Developer Community</h2> 
<p>Unlike ASP, PHP has a fairly large developer community that is active in 
reporting bugs and creating additionalPHP libraries. (See PEAR.)</p> 
<p>Additionally, PHP developers have contributed to a variety of open source 
projects. In our article<em>What Is Open Source?</em>, we talk about some open 
source projects that have been built usingPHP.</p> 
<h2>Speed</h2> 
<p>PHP is also faster than ASP. So if you have an application that performs 
multiple queries or is frequently accessed, it would be best to use a language 
that was more efficient.<br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to the four bullets mentioned above, there are some other 
points for comparison. The table below summarizes the differences. (This table 
was taken fromPHP and ASP.NET Go Head-to-Head.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> &nbsp; PHP 4 PHP 5 ASP.net <br>

Platform any any win32 (IIS only) <br>
Source 
available yes yes no <br>
Exceptions no yes yes <br>
OOP weak strong strong <br>
<br> 
<h2>So&hellip; Which Should You Choose?</h2> 
<p>When it comes down to it, PHP is the overall winner in terms of price, 
speed, platform compatibility, and the size and responsiveness of its developer 
community. However, before you make your decision, you should also consider the 
relative benefits of using other popular languages such as JSP (Java Server 
Pages) and ROR (Ruby On Rails).</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s a very good article regarding difference between asp.net and 
php. especially for those one like me who are delving into this filed( php).<br>
 very good article</p> </li>

<p>Thank you. This article really helped me.</p> </li>

<p>I doubt you have any experience in ASP.net</p> </li>

<p><b>@ben</b>: Thanks for visiting. While we do work primarily with PHP, for 
the obvious advantages, we do work withASP from time to time, as some of our 
clients have older websites which were built on that platform.</p> </li>

<p>This article shows a huge bias towards PHP. I agree with Ben as well. Most 
of what you have said can be argued, and anyone who says that one language is 
better than another is not doing enough research. I laughed when it was stated
PHP&rsquo;s speed is &ldquo;STRONG&rdquo; and asp.net&rsquo;s speed is 
&ldquo;WEAK&rdquo;.ASP and ASP.NET work totally different, and a compiled 
asp.net page is very fast. Also, code reusability with asp.net is exceptional.
</p>
<p>Note, I have nothing against PHP&ndash;I spent years in developing in it. I 
prefer asp.net though, drastically better for my needs.</p> </li>

<p>well, your title is PHP vs. ASP</p>
<p>but the table compares PHP vs. ASP.NET</p>
<p>so, PHP vs. ASP or PHP vs. ASP.NET ?</p>
<p>I use both &ndash; PHP and ASP.NET, depending on the current site. But I 
like moreASP.NET </p> </li>

<p>Disgustingly biassed. The cool thing is everyone sees through that so well 
now.<br>
 One of the biggest costs with any project is development time, and 
you can get through a huge amount more work with .NET technologies.<br>
 Not to 
mention it also being an ideal technology for many other areas such as desktop, 
server, mobile etc&hellip;<br>
 Comparing php against .NET is like comparing a 
microwave to a cooker. They can achieve similar results but they can&rsquo;t do 
everything the other can.</p> </li>

<p>I am biased towards PHP too but when it comes to speed, ASP.NET wins hands 
down. There is noway a interpreted language can beat a compiled one</p> </li>

<p>Not bad. Based on experience I love both PHP and ASP.net. However, I think 
MS Visual Web Developer is the reason why I prefer ASP.net at this point in 
time. Express is free, which is great for students and newcommers (or anyone 
really), and the debugging tools, intellitype, and many other features make 
this IDE really stand out. If I were making a decision based totally on 
language preference, it would bePHP. But when I bundle all of the various pros 
and cons (IDE, costs, performance, development time, etc), I chooseASP.NET 
again this year (2011) withMS development tools.</p> </li> </ul>
