<ul> 
<li></li> </ul> I've been approached to do some ASP or PHP work but it's been 
a long time since I've done any such work and I don't have the time to do it.
<br> <br>
 The project is creating a secure login system where users can 
reorder items. If anyone fancies taking this on for a bit of extra cash, isn't 
hard to pay and doesn't mind going under my name (as I intend to take commission
 ) please pm me.<br>
<br>
 Thanks <br>
 Darren<br>

L: Gateshead, UK </p> surely some mistake Daz. Isn't it a bit 
unethical to pass someone else's work of as your own, particularly if there's 
cash involved? SiteMorse have received a bit of a slating for it on these 
forums....<br>
<br>
 Not to mention what happens if 9 months down the line, the 
site collapses and they come running to you. Who knows nothing about it...<br>

<br> Your (presumably) previously good name will be away round the u-bend 
before you blink.<br>
<br>
 So in short, no, not for me thanks.<br>

L: Salford / Manchester / UK </p> jack, isn't it just a case 
of subcontracting?<br>

<ul> 
<li></li> </ul> Exactly Redux. It wouldn't be the first time I've 
sub-contracted work nor will it be the last. If you like Jack the way I treat 
it is that the person doing the work is a temporary employee for my freelance 
business.<br>
<br>
 Recently I have been designing sites for a web design 
company in England. They pay me a fixed price and likely charge the customer 2 
or 3 times what they give me. That's fine by me and I don't see any problem 
with it. What's important to them and me is that the work is up to the 
standards expected.<br>

 Thats the risk I take and can 
easily tie in as part of the arrangement with the sub contractor.<br>

L: Gateshead, UK </p> fair enough. Clarification accepted... 
if I see you as a business rather than an individual it all becomes clear in my 
head.<br>
<br>
 Apologies for having a go! <br>

L: Liverpool, UK </p> Although still a novice I would normally 
have asked for more information to see if i thought I could handle it, but I've 
just been given a rather large project to do (client was informed it would take 
3 months...)<br>
<br>
 I can't remember if you are a member of GAWDS or not, 
but it could be posted there if you want. (send me the text and I'll post if 
necessary).<br>
