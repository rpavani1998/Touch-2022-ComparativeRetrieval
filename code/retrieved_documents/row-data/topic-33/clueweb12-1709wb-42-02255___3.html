<b> ASP Vs. PHP </b><br>
<br>
By 
<strong>Halstatt Pires</strong><br>
<br>
 When building web sites, ASP and PHP 
are very popular languages. Here's my opinion on whether ASP or PHP is best.<br>
<br> Both ASP and PHP are languages used to build Dynamic Web sites that can 
interact with Databases and exchange information. ASP (Active Server Pages) is 
from Microsoft and is used with IIS (Internet Information Server) that runs on 
Microsoft Servers. PHP (Personal Home Pages) is from Rasmus Lerdorf, who 
originally designed this parsing language which was later modified by different 
people. It runs on Unix and Linux servers and it also has an NT server version.
<br> <br>
 There are a lot of differences between ASP and PHP. <br>
<br>

<strong>Cost </strong><br>
<br>
 To run ASP programs one needs IIS installed on 
a Windows platform server, which is not free. PHP programs run on Linux, which 
is free. Even the connectivity of the database is expensive in the case of ASP 
as MS-SQL is a product of Microsoft that needs to be purchased. PHP generally 
uses MySQL, which is freely available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Speed </strong><br>
<br>
 If we compare the speed of ASP and PHP then PHP has an upper hand. PHP code 
runs faster than ASP. ASP is built on COM based architecture, which is an 
overhead for the server whereas PHP code runs in its own memory space.<br>
<br>

<strong>Platform Compatibility </strong><br>
<br>
 PHP programs can run on 
various platforms like Linux, Unix, Windows and Solaris whereas ASP is mainly 
associated with Windows platforms. However, ASP can run on a Linux platform 
with ASP-Apache installed on the server.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Additional Costs 
</strong><br>
<br>
 Many of the tools used in PHP are free of cost and since 
PHP is open source a lot of code can be found in open source forums. PHP has 
inbuilt features like ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms 
but in ASP such features are not built in and some additional components are 
required. Therefore an additional cost is incurred for such components.<br>

<strong><br>
 Base Language </strong><br>
<br>
 PHP is based on C++ language 
and the syntax used in PHP is quite similar to C/C++. C/C++ is still considered 
the best programming language by many programmers and people who love this 
language would surely feel more comfortable with the syntax of PHP. ASP on the 
other hand has a more Visual Basic kind of syntax that again is closely related 
to only Microsoft products. So, it depends on a person-to-person which language 
he or she is comfortable<br>
<br>
<strong>Database Connectivity </strong><br>

<br> PHP, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most 
popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL.<br>
<br>
<strong>Conclusion 
</strong><br>
<br>
 Both languages have their advantages specific to users. 
Some would argue that both the languages have their own importance and 
depending on the user's requirements the language and the platform can be 
chosen. If we talk about developing a discussion board then ASP is equally 
capable but many feel the best discussion boards are developed in PHP. If a 
user is looking for some e-commerce application development then many would 
call ASP the ideal choice. This does not mean that PHP cannot provide 
e-commerce solutions, only that many people choose ASP.<br>
<br>
 From my 
perspective, PHP is an all around better choice than ASP.<br>
