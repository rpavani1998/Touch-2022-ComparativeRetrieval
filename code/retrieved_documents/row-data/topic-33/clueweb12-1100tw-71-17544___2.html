Which is better PHP or ASP.NET ? <br>
<br>
it's 
mostly an opinion: who loves microsoft's world will tell you that asp.net is 
better even for job opportunities... who prefers the rest, will say that php is 
better and will point you the huge amount of sites done with php (and open 
source cms and so on...), which are more than asp sites....<br>
<br>
I am on 
this side: php is better. let consider it but don't forget to check also 
asp.net later... and indeed you should choose according to the job you will 
get... select a list of firms you would like to work for and check the 
technology they use and want.<br>

<li>Quote</li> </ul>  By now you have cheated and looked at the spread sheet. 
<br> <br>
Yes, ASP.NET is universally faster than PHP (on Windows and on Linux) 
with the exceptions of File Copy and Attribute operations.<br>
<br>
MySQL 
Access from PHP on Linux is a TINY bit faster than SQL Server access on Windows 
(assuming common data types and SELECT statements) but probably not enough to 
matter.<br>
<br>
ASP.NET (C#) operations, object use, library calls, etc. are 
SIGNIFICANTLY faster that the PHP equivalents.<br>
<br>
I know my PHP friends 
and the Linux dudes (and dude-etts) will probably come out of the wood work to 
refute my tests and results&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve always thought 
that if high end performance options were part of your needs 
requirements,&nbsp; then .NET programming has some advanced options &ldquo;out 
of the box&rdquo; like multi-threading, asynchronous requests, and a number of 
caching options.<br>
<br>
NOTE &ndash; I&rsquo;m not saying &ldquo;ASP.NET is 
Faster so you shouldn&rsquo;t choose PHP !!!!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always contended 
that the affable simplicity of PHP had some drawbacks for certain advanced 
applications. (Just as the early learning complexity of ASP.NET can have 
it&rsquo;s drawbacks. )<br>
<br>
To me (your mileage may vary) the exciting 
thing about PHP is not the language / platform so much as it is what thousands 
of clever PHP Developers have done with it (Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, PHPBB, 
Nuke, etc.)<br>
<br>
In any event, it&rsquo;s nice to now have some data that 
PHP performance on Windows and Linux are &ldquo;in the same ballpark&rdquo;.<br>
<br>Now I can start writing those Windows specific PHP&nbsp; libraries 
I&rsquo;ve been dreaming about for years !! <br>
