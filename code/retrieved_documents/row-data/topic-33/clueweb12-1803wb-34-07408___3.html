<h5> ASP and PHP </h5>  &laquo; <strong> on:</strong> July 26, 2010, 11:15:28 
PM &raquo;  What is the different between ASP and PHP? As I understand it, both 
are scripting languages. What are the major differences between them? A friend 
of mine recommended that I use a service the supports PHP because it is better. 
Was that his personal opinion, or is PHP somehow considered better than ASP?<br>

<h5> Re: ASP and PHP </h5>  &laquo; <strong>Reply #1 on:</strong> September 
09, 2010, 09:35:25 PM &raquo;  Both ASP and PHP are languages used to build 
Dynamic Web sites that can interact with Databases and exchange information. 
ASP (Active Server Pages) is from Microsoft and is used with IIS (Internet 
Information Server) that runs on Microsoft Servers. PHP (PHP: Hypertext 
Preprocessor) is from Rasmus Lerdorf, who originally designed this parsing 
language which was later modified by different people. It runs on Unix and 
Linux servers and it also has an NT server version.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of 
differences between ASP and PHP.<br>
<br>
Cost <br>
<br>
To run ASP programs 
one needs IIS installed on a Windows platform server, which is not free. PHP 
programs run on Linux, which is free. Even the connectivity of the database is 
expensive in the case of ASP as MS-SQL is a product of Microsoft that needs to 
be purchased. PHP generally uses MySQL, which is freely available.<br>
<br>

Speed<br>
<br>
If we compare the speed of ASP and PHP then PHP has an upper 
hand. PHP code runs faster than ASP. ASP is built on COM based architecture, 
which is an overhead for the server whereas PHP code runs in its own memory 
space.<br>
<br>
Platform Compatibility <br>
<br>
PHP programs can run on 
various platforms like Linux, Unix, Windows and Solaris whereas ASP is mainly 
associated with Windows platforms. However, ASP can run on a Linux platform 
with ASP-Apache installed on the server.<br>
<br>
Additional Costs <br>
<br>

Many of the tools used in PHP are free of cost and since PHP is open source a 
lot of code can be found in open source forums. PHP has inbuilt features like 
ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms but in ASP such 
features are not built in and some additional components are required. 
Therefore an additional cost is incurred for such components.<br>
<br>
Base 
Language<br>
<br>
PHP is based on C++ language and the syntax used in PHP is 
quite similar to C/C++. C/C++ is still considered the best programming language 
by many programmers and people who love this language would surely feel more 
comfortable with the syntax of PHP. ASP on the other hand has a more Visual 
Basic kind of syntax that again is closely related to only Microsoft products. 
So, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable<br>
<br>Database Connectivity <br>
<br>
PHP, being extremely flexible, can connect 
to various databases, the most popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL.<br>

<br>Conclusion <br>
<br>
Both languages have their advantages specific to 
users. Some would argue that both the languages have their own importance and 
depending on the user's requirements the language and the platform can be 
chosen. If we talk about developing a discussion board then ASP is equally 
capable but many feel the best discussion boards are developed in PHP. If a 
user is looking for some e-commerce application development then many would 
call ASP the ideal choice. This does not mean that PHP cannot provide 
e-commerce solutions, only that many people choose ASP.<br>
