<h1>Is your code Thread Safe? How do you know?</h1> 
<p> <strong>Posted By : Dan Wilson</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  September 
27, 2007 8:45 PM </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Code that is not Thread Safe is sneaky, dangerous and leads to bewildering 
production errors and strange side effects.</p> 
<p>As part of my deployment procedure, I run code through an automated code 
analyzer for improperly scoped variables. Today, while running the analyzer, it 
flagged this set of code:</p> view plain copy to clipboard print about <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;ColdFISH is developed by Jason Delmore. Source code and license 
information available atcoldfish.riaforge.org<br>
&lt;cfset var 
ExistingRiskValuesList = &quot;&quot; /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&lt;cfset ExistingRiskValueList = valuelist( RiskAssessmentQuery.TotalLeaseRisk 
) &gt; 1&lt;cfset var ExistingRiskValuesList = &quot;&quot; /&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
2&lt;cfset ExistingRiskValueList = valuelist( 
RiskAssessmentQuery.TotalLeaseRisk )&gt;<br>
<br>

<p>&quot;Wait just a minute&quot;, I said, &quot;There is nothing wrong with 
that bit of code&quot;. Upon closer inspection I noted the 's' and quickly made 
the correction. Had I not used theautomated code analyzer, this Thread-Unsafe 
code would have went into production.</p> 
<p>There are many good posts about var scoping your variables, should you need 
more convincing.Mike Schierberl actually made and posted a video showing a 
memory leak in action caused by code that is not thread safe and Mike also 
gives away the automated code analyzer. If you haven't yet, I challenge you to 
download it and run it against some code. You might be surprised!</p> 
<p>Update: Mike Schieberl and Zac Spitzer have made some improvements to the 
Var Scoper tool. The tool parses cfscript and is now hosted on 
http://varscoper.riaforge.org/ . Thanks Mike and Zac for the fine work on one 
of the most important code checking tools out there!</p>

<h1>Using StructFind for fun and profit</h1> 
<p> <strong>Posted By : Dan Wilson</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  September 
21, 2007 8:54 AM </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>There is a very weird debate going on in the CF-Aussie list about the 
merits of the ColdFusion function structFind(). StructFind( struct, key ), is 
an aptly-named native function that fetches the value of the specified key, in 
the specified struct. If, for some reason, the key does not exist, it throws an 
error.(The docs are wrong)</p> 
<p>Why would you ever need this function? One use case would be returning the 
value a key in a structure that is the result of a function evaluation. Take 
this example:</p>

<h1>Pablo Vos Presents Ten facts why Coldfusion beats PHP and ASP</h1> 
<p> <strong>Posted By : Dan Wilson</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  September 
19, 2007 8:21 AM </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Someone just forwarded an article from Pablo Vos, &quot;10 facts why 
ColdFusion is better than PHP or ASP&quot;. The 10 facts are are compelling 
reasons why IT managers and executives should prefer ColdFusion over PHP or ASP.
</p> 
<p>In my experience, ColdFusion makes the most sense as an enterprise web 
application development language. Compatibilities with other languages, 
integrated libraries and high levels of language functionality all make for the 
fastest application delivery platform available.</p> 
<p>Clients tell me of the extra effort in Offshoring complex projects but feel 
they have no choice due to the manpower needed to keep IT systems current and 
competitive. I consistently work with them to show how utilizing ColdFusion 
will accomplish their goals and reduce needed IT FTEs.</p> 
<p>We are entering a new dawn of ColdFusion. Increasing amounts of 
organizations understand how ColdFusion can tie into disparate systems and 
quickly offer feature-rich applications requiring minimal maintenance manpower.
</p> 
<p>After all, success in business is in spending less and accomplishing more 
than your competitors, isn't it?</p>

16 
&lt;/cffunction&gt;<br>
<br>

<p>I just spent 15 minutes tracing all this code out trying to find out why 
nothing was returned. The intent of the code is to build a string containing 
values present in the object. So if a user searches by Category, UserID etc, 
the search string is maintained.</p> 
<p>Warning, the error is simpler than you might think. Don't over think it.</p>
