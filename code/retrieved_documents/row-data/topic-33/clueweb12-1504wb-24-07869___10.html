<p>Finding the Right PHP Developer</p> 
<p>By Josek Morin</p> 
<p>Web development is an important part of business marketing today. Not only 
do you need efficient programs and applications to take care of your business 
operations and management, but there are a huge number of other factors that 
make developing the right web application an important factor to consider for 
almost any business.</p> 
<p>There are a good number of programming platforms and languages that 
developers use today to provide businesses and consumers the right web 
applications to help them with their requirements. PHP is one such programming 
language that has gained a huge popularity over time, and that too quite 
rightfully.</p> 
<p>Apart from offering a completely free platform for web development (with 
Linux and MySQL), the work of a PHP developer is much simpler than most others, 
and hence offers your business an inexpensive, yet effective solution.</p> 
<p>However there are a number of factors that you must consider while looking 
to hire PHP programmers for your web development requirements.</p> 
<p><strong>Some Useful Tips to Hire PHP Developers</strong></p> 
<p>1. Make sure you work with an individual PHP developer or business that has 
the right skills and experience, and are in constant touch with PHP development 
projects.</p> 
<p>2. Look for professionals who have had adequate PHP training and recognized 
certification</p> 
<p>3. Ensure the delivery time is something that will suit your requirements
</p> 
<p>4. Communication is of the utmost importance. You should be able to deal 
with the PHP developers efficiently using a project management tool and contact 
them easily as and when required</p> 
<p>5. Look through the portfolio and contact some of the ex-clients to get a 
clear idea as to how efficient their services have been before you deicide to 
hire PHP programmers</p> 
<p><strong>Moreover, ensure the business or the PHP professional you have 
decided to deal with are capable of:</strong></p> 
<p>1. Offering you the right services related to web integration and 
maintenance, as well as further development</p> 
<p>2. Demonstrating clear concepts regarding the right design etiquette</p> 
<p>3. Planning towards efficient resource management</p> 
<p>4. Possessing knowledge on associated software (like CMS) and multimedia</p>
<p>5. Offering you the most competitive price plans with the maximum 
reliability</p> 
<p>There are a number of points where PHP excels over the other available 
programming platforms, apart from the most obvious price factor. For example, a 
Linux server is very stable and offers a much faster system than a Windows 
server would.</p> 
<p>At the same time, mySQL databases are much lighter than the most popular 
RDBMS software, and yet offer almost all the features necessary for a web 
application to perform in the best possible way. MySQL too is freely available 
for you to use towards your web development needs.</p> 
<p>In order to lay your hands on all these benefits associated with a PHP 
development environment, it is very important that you only hire PHP developers 
who can show you the right level of expertise and results for the money you 
spend on them.</p> 
<p>Bear these above mentioned points on your mind when you decide to look for 
PHP developers for your business web application development requirements if 
you want the best results at the end of the day!</p>  Tags: cms, mysql, php,

<h2>Website Content Management Software</h2>  Saturday, March 13th, 2010 |

<p>Website Content Management Software</p> 
<p>By David T Webb</p> 
<p>What is Drupal?</p> 
<p>Drupal is an open-source content management system (CMS). Basically its an 
environment that allows you to develop powerful websites quickly and with 
relative ease.</p> 
<p>Why use Drupal?</p> 
<p>Firstly, it&rsquo;s free. It manages your website content. Easily store and 
edit all your content and data, display your website pages, easily and 
instantly edit the appearance of your website using Themes (templates), Color 
profiles. Drupal lets you easily add features to your website, such as Image 
galleries, Blogs, Forums, Calendars, Video Streaming, Podcasts, and many other 
features. Drupal has a large online community, supporting each other and 
developing drupal add-on modules to provide extra functionality to the system. 
Get started now with drupal at drupal.org</p> 
<p>How Drupal works</p> 
<p>All content; such as articles, information, user details, etc, are stored 
in a database. The database is accessed and managed via a database server. The 
design and layout of a drupal site is handled by themes. These are template 
files, styled with graphics and text. Themes allow you to easily change the 
appearance of your website without modifying any of your content. Drupal uses 
the PHP programming language. PHP is open-source and therefore free to use.</p> 
<p>Drupal requires 3 things to work; A server environment, such as Apache, A 
PHP Server and a mySQL database server.All of the above can be downloaded in a 
complete package for you to use while developing websites on your PC. I 
recommend that Windows users check out Xampp, Linux users can use Lamp. But 
there are many other all-in-one PHP-mySQL development environments too. Once 
you have your development environment set up, then you can install drupal and 
start making websites.</p> 
<p>How to install and setup Drupal</p> 
<p>Required Software; Development environment: Xampp (Windows), Lamp (Linux), 
Drupal installation file (compressed archive, e.g..zip or.gz). Download from 
drupal.org.</p> 
<p>Installation steps:</p> 
<p>Extract the drupal installation file to your htdocs folder. This is the 
folder where your website files for your development environment are found. I 
will assume from here on that you extracted the drupal installation archive to 
a folder called &lsquo;drupal&rsquo;. (The default folder is something like 
&lsquo;drupal-6.13&prime; with the version included.) Copy the 
settings.default.php in the &lsquo;sites/default&rsquo; folder to settings.php. 
To do this, in your file browser, navigate to drupal, sites, default, make a 
copy of settings.default.php, rename the copy to settings.php. Create a 
database for your drupal installation to use, this may vary depending on your 
development environment and database server. If you are using Xampp, navigate 
to localhost/phpmyadmin. In the Create new database field, enter the name of 
your new database, e.g. drupaldb and click create. Finally, navigate to 
&lsquo;localhost/drupal/install.php&rsquo; in your web browser. Follow the 
instructions to complete the installation of drupal.</p> 
<p>How Drupal Themes Work</p> 
<p>Drupal displays and styles your content using themes. A theme consists of; 
theme template files and theme functions. Theme template files display your 
content through an html and css styled template file. So your site design and 
content are separate. This means that you can easily change the visual display 
of your site without affecting the content.</p> 
<p>How to change the theme in drupal</p> 
<p>In drupal there are two themes that can be applied to your website; the 
default Theme and administration Theme. The administration theme is applied to 
the site when the administrator is logged in and is viewing pages under the 
Administer menu item. In all other cases the default theme is applied to the 
website. To change the default theme, navigate to Administer, Site Building, 
Themes. Scroll down to the theme you want, enable it by checking the checkbox. 
Activate it by selecting the radio button (column labeled as default). Scroll 
down and click Save configuration. To change the administration theme, navigate 
to Administer, Site Configuration, Administration theme. Select the name of the 
theme you want to use as the administration theme. Click Save configuration.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p> 
<p>Drupal is a robust, free, community developed open source, multi-functional 
website creation and management system. It is arguably the best content 
management system available, under continuous development and improvement. It 
has detailed documentation on every aspect, from basic to advanced level. To 
get started with drupal or for more information, visit drupal.org.</p>

development. Visit hisDrupal Theme Tester to see drupal themes live in action.

<h2>10 Things to Know When You Select the Best Drupal Hosting</h2>  Wednesday,

<p>10 Things to Know When You Select the Best Drupal Hosting</p> 
<p>By Jared D. Ingram</p> 
<p>Drupal hosting is a new concept in the internet world and has amazed all 
the human minds. In the beginning there was just a simple concept, web hosting. 
It later developed into dedicated web hosting and cheap web hosting, the 
technology just got better and PHP and ASP hosting services dawned on the web. 
The new technology just gets better with each day and right from the static 
pages to the dynamic ones, slowly the things only keep getting better and 
slowly the wordpress hosting, joomla hosting and PHPBB hosting has come our way.
</p> 
<p>Now, let us get down to Drupal hosting, this is basically a CMS or content 
management system and has been written down by the PHP and needs the MySQL 
database to function properly. Now after understanding the basic also know that 
drupal hosting can turn your website into large ones and small logs would soon 
help you in creating big directories and online communities.</p> 
<p>If you are searching for best drupal hosting service for you then you must 
take 10 things into consideration:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Drupal is established by PHP even though you can always select a windows 
hosting and PostgreSQL, but the finest alternative to function Drupal hosting 
is still the Linux and MySQL.</li> 
<li>Even now, drupal hosting is new to the internet world and not all the good 
web hosting companies will be able to offer you with solutions that give your 
Drupal site good support.</li> 
<li>A company that offers free Drupal installation and free themes etc does 
not mean that they are the best drupal hosting services. You will get the same 
free services with Fantastico, you have to know that all the hosting companies 
have these tools set up to be able to provide you with the services and that 
Fantastico is already very popular in the web hosting companies.</li> 
<li>The clean URL support is vital requirement from the best hosting as it 
would make your website more search engine friendly.</li> 
<li>If you want to get multi-site features of the best hosting, you would have 
to get an access to the Unix Shell and create a Symlink. Though for the 
security purposes, this might not be permissible. In such cases you can also 
create a PHP script for accomplishing your task.</li> 
<li>The best drupal hosting can only work if the database runs very fast and a 
lot o companies fail to do that.</li> 
<li>There are some hosting companies that will set a limit for you to utilize 
the CPU resource or the Memory resource. You will have to check with the 
hosting providers and understand the data and also keep a close check on your 
website to see if it gets down for this trouble. If this is the trouble then 
you will have to upgrade your hosting.</li> 
<li>Select a drupal hosting company that permits you to preserve your cron 
jobs.</li> 
<li>There is a common phenomenon for all the shared web hosting companies; 
here you will receive unlimited bandwidth and disk space. But do not believe 
these companies and always remember that you will get for what you will pay!
</li> 
<li>Backup your website daily, this is really important.</li> </ul>
