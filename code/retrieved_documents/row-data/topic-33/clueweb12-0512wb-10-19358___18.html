<blockquote> 
<p>NOTE: This is &ldquo;Misfit Data&rdquo; &ndash; While I do work for 
Microsoft, this data is NOT &ldquo;official Microsoft&rdquo; data and is not 
endorsed or ratified by Microsoft in any way. I built and ran these tests 
because I was personally curious about comparative performance.</p> 
<p>If these test results cause you dizziness, vomiting, or other undesired 
side effects, please discontinue use immediately and consult your physician.</p>

<h1>How does IMPLEMENTATION Performance Compare ?</h1> 
<p>Usually, when someone creates benchmarks, they are trying to prove that 
their thing is faster than someone else&rsquo;s thing.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m PAID by Microsoft to write BOTH PHP and ASP.NET Code. I was doing 
PHP before .NET shipped. I love them both.</p> 
<p>This makes it hard for me to say anything good about either one. When I 
confer a preference for something in PHP, my Microsoft peers send me flame mail 
and when I confer a preference for something in ASP.NET, my PHP friends come 
out of the woodwork to call me a Microsoft shill.</p> 
<p>I started building and running these tests because everyone had opinions 
about comparative PHP performance (Windows versus Linux &amp; 5.2 versus 5.3), 
but no one had any solid data.</p> 
<p>So, I decided to collect some empirical evidence of my own.</p> 
<p>[ You can CLICK HERE to see the result spreadsheet. ]</p> 
<p>Before you look at them, let m e provide some method details and context.
</p> 
<p>All tests were run on the SAME Machine.</p> 
<p>A Toshiba Tecra M5 with 4 Gig of ram and a 60 Gig 7200 RPM Hard Drive.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu 9 and Windows Server 2008 Standard were natively installed on 2 
separate (but identical) hard drives.</p> 
<p>The web servers were Apache2 on Linux and IIS 7 on Windows.</p> 
<p>Both operating systems were fully patched / updated.</p> 
<p>No Operating System or Development Runtime performance enhancements were 
added.</p> 
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t investigating how much speed an expert could custom tailor 
the tests to on a specific platform.</p> 
<p>Yes, I could implement PHP Byte Caching, or for ASP.NET I could use Page 
Caching, Partial Page Caching, SQL Cache Dependency, Multi Threading, etc.</p> 
<p>Both Windows and Linux Implementations of PHP will benefit from PHP Byte 
Code caching.</p> 
<p>My goal was to determine the relative speed of THE IMPLEMENTATION.</p> 
<p>I found the results both interesting and unexpected.</p> 
<h1>PHP on Linux Versus PHP on Windows&hellip;..</h1> 
<p>I really though one would just be faster than the other, but I was wrong. 
Some things are faster on Windows, other are faster on Linux.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>RAW statement execution seems faster on Windows.</li> 
<li>Function Calls were faster on Windows</li> 
<li>Object Creation / Access was faster on Linux with PHP 5.2 but faster on 
Windows with 5.3</li> 
<li>Library calls were faster on Linux. (Example: Encryption 3-5 times faster 
on Ubuntu.)</li> 
<li>File Access is faster on Linux by a small percentage, except for file copy 
operations which was as much as 60% slower on Windows probably due to the ACL 
advanced security.</li> 
<li>MySQL access with Linux is faster by more than a little and on Windows, 
MySQL access deteriorates in version 5.3 (This seems to be poor implementation, 
see PostgreSQL below.)</li> 
<li>PostgreSQL performance is very close on both platforms (within 6/100 of a 
second for 1000 Operations) &ndash; It&rsquo;s faster on Windows and faster 
still on Windows with PHP 5.3</li> 
<li>MS SQL Server access from PHP 5.2 on Windows is marginally slower than 
MySQL access on Linux. (PHP 5.3 not yet supported at the time of this writing.)
</li> </ul> 
<p>So what does all that mean ?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We can probably say that in terms of raw execution &ndash; performance on 
Linux versus Windows is probably a wash (more or less equivalent) so that the 
performance of PHP itself becomes a moot factor in choosing Linux or Windows 
for PHP application deployment.</li> 
<li>If you are building an application, or running an application that 
supports it, PostgreSQL might be a better database choice since it performs 
pretty much the same on Windows and Linux.</li> 
<li>If you are running an application that locks you in to Sun 
Microsystems&rsquo; MySQL and you want to run it on Windows, your should do 
scale planning. (My personal guess is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that Sun will 
markedly improve MySQL performance on Windows. )</li> 
<li>Version 1 of the PHP Driver for SQL Server (V2 is in the works) is 
somewhat slower than MySQL or PostpreSQL but probably not enough to discourage 
use where diverse developer access is desired. (v2 ot the driver will improve 
performance. )</li> </ul> 
<p>By and large I think the PHP team and the Microsoft IIS team have 
accomplished good raw performance equivalence across platforms. (Now we just 
need to get the Open Source Application teams (Drupal, WordPress, Joomle, etc.) 
to do performance optimization on both !)</p> 
<h1>PHP versus ASP.NET Raw Performance &hellip;..</h1> 
<p>By now you have cheated and looked at the spread sheet.</p> 
<p>Yes, ASP.NET is universally faster than PHP (on Windows and on Linux) with 
the exceptions of File Copy and Attribute operations.</p> 
<p>MySQL Access from PHP on Linux is a TINY bit faster than SQL Server access 
on Windows (assuming common data types and SELECT statements) but probably not 
enough to matter.</p> 
<p>ASP.NET (C#) operations, object use, library calls, etc. are SIGNIFICANTLY 
faster that the PHP equivalents.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I know my PHP friends and the Linux dudes (and dude-etts) will probably 
come out of the wood work to refute my tests and results &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that if high end performance options were part of 
your needs requirements,&nbsp; then .NET programming has some advanced options 
&ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; like multi-threading, asynchronous requests, and a 
number of caching options.</p> 
<p>NOTE &ndash; I&rsquo;m not saying &ldquo;ASP.NET is Faster so you 
shouldn&rsquo;t choose PHP !!!!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always contended that the 
affable simplicity of PHP had some drawbacks for certain advanced applications. 
(Just as the early learning complexity of ASP.NET can have it&rsquo;s 
drawbacks. )</p> 
<p>To me (your mileage may vary) the exciting thing about PHP is not the 
language / platform so much as it is what thousands of clever PHP Developers 
have done with it (Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, PHPBB, Nuke, etc.)</p> 
<p>In any event, it&rsquo;s nice to now have some data that PHP performance on 
Windows and Linux are &ldquo;in the same ballpark&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Now I can start writing those Windows specific PHP&nbsp; libraries 
I&rsquo;ve been dreaming about for years !!</p>

<p>Joe,</p> 
<p>Thanks for this article. I found it most helpful, as I too am a 
&quot;switch hitter&quot; in that I develop projects in both ASP.net and 
PHP/MySQL. I agree that the folks who developed Drupal, Joomla and WordPress 
have done a great job using PHP to accomplish this.</p> 
<p>If I had to choose, I would utilize ASP.net simply because I like the 
Visual Studio IDE experience. I&rsquo;ve used Zend Studio and Eclipse and 
haven&rsquo;t quite had the same success. My clients ultimately dictate what 
programming language to use based on their server environment. I&rsquo;ve seen 
a lot of articles about how it&rsquo;s better to focus on .Net or PHP but not 
both. However, I disagree because ultimately I need to meet client&rsquo;s 
needs which might require the use of ASP.net for one project, and PHP for a 
different one.</p> 
<p>Thanks Again!</p> </li>

</p> 
<p>This is music to my ears. All these days, I was a bit guilty of not honing 
my PHP skills and bowed to .NET. Tonight it&rsquo;s a good night sleep.</p> 
<p>Great Joe.</p> </li> 
<li> hajan on August 5th, 2009 5:07 pm 
<p>Joe, thanks for the article and for sharing the tests you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>I have quite similar experience&hellip; </p> 
<p>I have started working on PHP but ended up with ASP.NET because simply I 
feel the power which is above PHP.</p> 
<p>I have personally made only few of the tests for which you already provided 
more detailed explanation and tests on your results spreadsheet and I 
don&rsquo;t have anything to say except to strongly agree with the results you 
have achieved.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I still love both ASP.NET &amp; PHP because both these give me 
opportunity to work and accomplish great things, even though, I have always 
preferred ASP.NET before PHP.</p> 
<p>Cheers</p> </li>

<p>Beforehand i&rsquo;d like to say that i&rsquo;m not a fanatic, and, 
i&rsquo;ve also tested alot of thing you already did, in different version 
along the last years.</p> 
<p>I often find this comparisons to be a bit biased towards the expertise of 
the person testing it, if one is more proeficient with windows then the tests 
tend to favour windows, if the tester is more proeficient with linux it favours 
linux etc.</p> 
<p>Thing is most of the time, people disregard several importan aspects while 
testing, making a test in a standard out of the box install of 
linux/apache/php/mysql/postgresql vs windows/iis/mysql/postgresql is not quite 
accurate, the hardware for starters should be the same, then, both operating 
systems / software should be configured for maximum performance (since 
that&rsquo;s what a sane person would do in a production environment) and only 
then compare results. For instance, have you installed a PHP accelerator like 
APC ? or have you optimized Apache ? the same applied to windows obviously.</p> 
<p>Out of the box benchmarks worth just that&hellip;</p> 
<p>Good effort though.</p> 
<p>Best regards</p> </li> 
<li> Shannon Deminick on August 5th, 2009 9:44 pm 
<p>Just wanted to know what implementation of PHP you are using on windows: 
FastCGI or ISAPI?</p> </li> 
<li> Avinash on August 5th, 2009 10:49 pm 
<p>Nice one. Is there a way where you can compare ASP with ASP.NET because 
many people like me have the doubt that Microsoft is killing ASP in the 
upcoming servers.</p> </li>

<p>Thanks for performing tests. These are quite useful.</p> 
<p>There are few things I would like to know like how PHP in IIS configured, 
if FastCGi than version of FastCGI. Are OSes 32-bit or 64bit?</p> 
<p>It would be better if Ubuntu with PHP 5.3 is also tested.</p>

<p>Hi friends,</p> 
<p>I am using ASP.Net and never known to php and dont even like to be switched 
as I am quite comfort on windows platform. But as a freelancer when I see 
online projects, I always found php products are many more than ASP.Net. So I 
think as I freelancer I have less opportunity.</p> 
<p>This is very painful. As ultimate object of learning ASP.Net for me is to 
earn money.</p> 
<p>What you think.</p> 
<p>Thanks &amp; Best Regards</p>

<li> Brian Dines on August 6th, 2009 7:29 am 
<p>I have in the past worked with ASP with MSAccess/SQL Server, PHP with MYSql 
and ASP.NET with SQL Server.</p> 
<p>I also did some simple tests back when ASP.NET was v1.1. I noted that with 
ASP and PHP, PHP was generally faster. With ASP.NET and PHP, .NET was faster 
but not greatly. This was before I really knew what I was doing too.</p> 
<p>I like all 3, although if given a choice I would always go the .NET route. 
I never used visual studio &ndash; I was using Macromedia/Adobe Homesite for 
coding. I now use Studio 2008 exclusively for coding although Homesite had some 
nice touches I still consider superior to any other editor, particularly its 
extensibility via JScript and user-defined forms.</p> 
<p>I probably would use PHP over ASP, but ASP.NET over PHP. I really dislike 
MySQL as it does weird things sometimes with queries and prefer stored 
procedures on SQL Server.</p> </li> 
<li> Chris Love on August 6th, 2009 7:42 am 
<p>Thanks for doing this Joe. I rememeber attending a Mix &rsquo;08 IIS 
session where they were showing PHP test on IIS 7 showed signigicant perf 
increases over Apache. They said it was because IIS 7 provides a true 
multithreaded web server for PHP. I am not a LAMP person by any means, but that 
made sense because my LAMP friends always talk about scaling as adding more 
servers, ie more hardware. Can you speak to this sometime?</p> </li>

<p>Sharique, </p> 
<p>Good questions. First, I didn&rsquo;t test 5.3 becuase the Ubuntu package 
manager doesn&rsquo;t include 5.3. I tried building 5.3 from source but it kept 
failing and the only pre built binaries I could find for 5.3 were Beta.</p> 
<p>The OS versions were both 32 bit. Given that the test were single user and 
the macine wasn&rsquo;t running anything else, I suspect tests would not be 
effected by 64bit.</p> 
<p>The Windows 08, IIS 7, FastCGI was fully updated. </p>

<p>A magazine to which I contribute articles recently did a PHP on win vs. Lin 
article and found that PH ran better on Linux than Windows. I was quite 
surprised by that knowing that PHP with FastCGI does have a number of 
optimizations on IIS7. Can you please take a look at let us know your thoughts 
on these results? The article is available at:

<p>Nice, I always thought asp.net was slower than php.</p> 
<p>Now, I see, with good development practices, you can have a great 
performance at asp.net too.</p> 
<p>Congratulation, excelent article</p> </li> 
<li> Joe Stagner on August 6th, 2009 9:50 am 
<p>Vinod &ndash; this is typical of the stuff I found when I did my initial 
search. It&rsquo;s simply a declaration that one is faster than the other. No 
share code or methodology. In my opinion that makes the article meaningless.</p>

<li> Craig on August 6th, 2009 10:37 am 
<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose for the moment that your numbers are in the general 
ballpark. (I think they probably are.) In an economically-challenged country 
like the USA, is this the question that really matters? To really make the two 
stand apart, isn&rsquo;t it TCO that counts? Isn&rsquo;t this the answer that 
CIOs are looking for?</p> 
<p>To factor that all in, you&rsquo;ve got to consider a gazillion things, 
like the development environment, RAD vs. RUP, startup hardware costs (must 
consider #users served over x amount of time, not just #users served at a 
snapshot in time), startup software costs, ongoing licensing costs, ongoing 
maintenance costs, developer availability, code comprehensibility, security 
costs, and on and on. This means that for different environments, the choice 
may vary. For the freelancer, it may be one choice, while the 10,000 employee 
enterprise IT staff may need a completely different choice (or choices.)</p> 
<p>So, who&rsquo;s going to step up and pull those numbers out of their hat? 
PHP vs .NET? Not my question, I can learn to code in anything, frankly. To have 
money or not to have money, that is the question. &lsquo;Cuz that&rsquo;s where 
the business is ultimately going to go, and that&rsquo;s what I want to learn. 
Personally, I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand the hidden costs of both Java and .NET in 
an Fortune 500 environment, and .NET still has my focus. Haven&rsquo;t messed 
with PHP much yet; no incentive to do so. Make me see the value in the 
switch&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>Just to provide some numbers from my experience: I saw a team of 20 
experienced developers from India (no 1st-timers) rewrite 50% of an existing 
application in 1 year for a cost of about $1M. Single request times were 2-3 
seconds per page, when the existing system was under .5 seconds per page. It 
choked badly when they cranked up the user load in testing.</p> 
<p>I could have easily redone the entire application by myself in .NET in the 
same amount of time, and guaranteed better response times. Assuming they 
finished the app in another year (I left the company disgusted with their 
choice, which I advised against), the total cost would be approaching $2M, for 
something I could have done for about 1/20th the cost with faster performance 
in .NET. Now you know why I prefer it. I have no reason to believe that PHP 
will be any better, especially given Joe&rsquo;s numbers.</p> 
<p>Granted, you could argue that the India team had a vested interest in 
running up the cost, but isn&rsquo;t that what we are talking about here? TCO? 
They also had a vested interest in getting good response times to prove 
themselves valuable. I talked with them, they were smart guys. But the 
technology they used was very inadequate for the task, and the TCO was poorly 
calculated up front. And 40,000 end users paid a price as well. PHP may not 
suffer from the performance problem, but what about the TCO? That&rsquo;s 
crucial.</p> </li>

<p>ASP.NET: &quot;Whose your daddy?!&quot;</p> 
<p>LAMP: &quot;I&rsquo;ll never join you!&quot;</p> 
<p>ASP.NET: &quot;If you only knew the power of the .NET side.&quot;</p> 
<p>LAMP: &quot;My professor told me enough. He told me PHP was faster!&quot;
</p> 
<p>ASP.NET: &quot;No, I am your father.&quot;</p> 
<p>LAMP: &quot;No&hellip; No&hellip; That&rsquo;s not true&hellip; 
That&rsquo;s impossible!&quot;</p> 
<p>ASP.NET: &quot;Search your feelings, you know it to be true&quot;</p>

<p>Hey Joe great article I was going to send you an email asking you about 
this om the same lines I,m a novice self taught novice</p> 
<p>wannabe the gov. here in Canada has released a pile of training money for 
anyone affected by the recession I qualify for training money the only 
accredited courses I can find in B.C. Canada are open source drupal PHP and so 
on I wold like to learn ASP.NET with some credits since I have a passion for 
and have invested so much time I on ASP.NET Microsoft rules you guys are a 
great team so I have a two part question</p> 
<p>1, if I do the PHP thing will it help me be better ASP.NET developer in the 
long run basically how much is related</p> 
<p>2, Where could I get the equivalent training in ASP.NET in this part of the 
world</p> </li> 
<li> nollkoll on August 6th, 2009 1:00 pm 
<p>mildly interesting comparison. like always developers will find ways to 
make any platform shine or slow down using any random anti-pattern. what i 
would like to see is a good comparison on architecture in terms of how 
productive can i get. short term and long term. i have just started to play a 
bit with php to get a feel for what it can do since i dont have asp.net on my 
mac except virtually. i miss so many nice features from .net that i feel one 
quickly has gotten used to having. like linq and where are my telerik 
components ?? you mean i have to code all ajax code myself in php??  what is 
the key advantage of using php (technically not on price- price is irrelevant 
in this discussion) the whole infrastructure seem so bare. and what about mvc 
or some scaffolding structure like rail? seems it does not exist for php or 
only in tiny corner or php universe. would help to make an informed decision on 
using php for anything&hellip; my initial php trials tell me im better off 
learning objective-c on mac than web development, if im going to do any mac dev 
at all, since there is nothing that let me be as productive as i am in .net.</p>

<p>@Jay Khatri, Its true that PHP has more freelance projects. And I am glad 
that .NET doesn&rsquo;t have them. You know why? Because those projects are 
piece of shi*t. I can tell 90% of them will never go live..they are cheap 
projects for some cheap people a way of making quick money. But .NET have big 
projects..that PHP devs can only dream of..In our country; an avarage .NET 
developer earns two to three times salary than an avarage PHP developer of same 
experience. So its easy to see the difference on basis of financial benefits.
</p> 
<p>I wont go comparing between these two. Because comparing .NET platform with 
PHP would be like comparing an ocean with my reservoir.</p> </li>

can afford a few milliseconds of performance loss to save you wallet. At the

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to compare PHP without an opcode cache 
(like APC). It is included as part of the PECL, so it is a part of the PHP 
environment.</p> 
<p>You can&rsquo;t compare an opcode cache to page caching. .Net has the 
benefit of using bytecode, while PHP has to parse the file and 
&quot;compile&quot; for each page request. So you deny PHP the advantage that 
.Net has.</p> 
<p>I know you can&rsquo;t setup every type of caching solution. But adding APC 
would only put PHP on equal ground, since .Net already has something similar in 
the form of compiled byte code.</p> </li>

<p>I make things in asp.net while I dabble in php. I use php projects (drupal, 
etc&hellip;) because they are free, numerous and quite often, though not 
always, of high quality. I know php enough to get around and to hijack the good 
ideas and put them in asp.net.</p> 
<p>Hands down the reason I use asp.net is because of the IDE. PHP&rsquo;s IDEs 
are jokes with no punchlines; they really, really suck. The second reason I 
asp.net is that the Windows technology stack is cohesive and well documented 
(Ubuntu is a great tack for the Linux community). On the other hand the Free 
stack seems to remain perpetually unfinished, unpolished and all the pieces to 
the puzzle are laying all over the place and documented in gibberish. It gives 
me motion sickness to think of starting from scratch on a Free stack.</p> </li>

<p>Good tests Joe. Why no Perl comparison too? </p> 
<p>@opus131. I call BS. &quot;semi-professional&quot;, such a condescending 
attitude. If you don&rsquo;t care to write code in PHP, say it. But don&rsquo;t 
be a jerk about it.</p> 
<p>I believe with the speed of hardware, and it&rsquo;s relatively cheap cost, 
the difference in speeds with most things (.Net, PHP, Perl) are negligible. I 
think @nollkoll eluded to this, but the real question is your IT&rsquo;s 
productivity. Given a given RFP spec for a project, can an experienced PHP, 
Perl, Ruby/Rails, Objective-C/{J} or .Net developer finish the project in the 
same time and have it operate in relatively the same speed?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that question&rsquo;s even answerable without a flame 
war. It&rsquo;d be expensive to put on and I think it&rsquo;d take some work to 
do fairly. But for me, that is the ultimate question.</p> 
<p>For the record, I&rsquo;ve written Objective-C, PHP, Perl and 
asp/vb/c#/.Net. Different tools for different jobs (employers, too). Each has 
it&rsquo;s own rewards and each has it&rsquo;s own irks. As long as 
someone&rsquo;s willing to pay me a good buck I&rsquo;ll write in, or learn, 
whatever language and/or framework they need me to write in for them.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;PostgreSQL performance is very close on both platforms (within 6/100 
of a second for 1000 Operations) &ndash; It&rsquo;s faster on Windows and 
faster still on Windows with PHP 5.3&quot;</p> 
<p>For Sure, PostgreSQL is better with PHP.</p> 
<p>MySql backup and restore features are very bad.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s all about business, if you keep your mind as a developer go 
ahead and cry like a baby &quot;Mommy I want ASP.net&quot; or &quot;Mommy I 
want PHP&quot;, but if you are a professional software engineer you have to be 
technical in your choice, and manage the variables of your project, this is not 
a soccer game.</p>

<p>Speed of execution of a web scripting language is so rarely a performance 
bottleneck that this discussion isn&rsquo;t even worth having. For nearly every 
non-trivial web site, the bottleneck is at the network and database level, not 
in the speed of execution of the business logic and presentation script.</p> 
<p>Cost/performance is a much more meaningful metric for all but the most 
trivial applications. And if you get around to doing that kind of test, you 
should probably account for the fact that it typically takes hours to set up 
and configure a Windows server (while most Linux sysadmins can do it in under 
10 minutes).</p> 
<p>Saying that PHP isn&rsquo;t a &quot;professional&quot; language is just 
dippy, since nearly all of the largest web sites in the world today were built 
with PHP.</p> </li>

<p>Not tweaking performance on both systems was a good choice for this test. 
Not everyone knows how to get the best performance out of their systems/code. 
Most developers I have come across don&rsquo;t even care about performance. 
It&rsquo;s really sad.</p> </li>

<p>I like asp.net/mvc, c#, visual studio, iis, sql server and windows server, 
and i have followed ms over 10 years, but when i plan to start a small 
business, i find i have not enougth $ to buy the ENVIRONMENTs, although maybe i 
can use the illegal soft of visual studio, sql server and windows server, but 
if i do so in my OWN business, i feel very sorry and uncomfortable, if i use 
the illegal soft, maybe some day, before i have made some money, i have lost my 
future.</p> 
<p>as a c# developer, i really dislike the ugly php, but maybe i have to make 
a decision to use LAMP.</p> 
<p>sigh&hellip;</p> 
<p>if some day during my life, i luckly see the asp.net/mvc can fully run on 
linux/unix, or the ENVIRONMENTS are cheap enough for beginning companies, i 
will be happy.</p> </li>

<p>Cause they don&rsquo;t know how to use it properly mate. Guy even had 
problem with proper installation of PHP 5.3 on &lsquo;Ubuntu&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Well if you&rsquo;d spent some time on the real, debian based linux server 
(-&gt; yes I know, there&rsquo;s no point and click :D:D )and apply proper 
framework like CodeIgniter or ZF + mod_deflate you would notice difference in 
speed/development.</p> 
<p>Shame all .NET developers are negative to language which makes websites 
more maintainable (yeah, even designer can do change &amp; develop his skills 
without paying $$$ to anyone).</p> 
<p>@Ozzy -&gt; for last 4 years I&rsquo;ve seen worst so called &lsquo;custom 
tags&rsquo; from ASP.NET Developers, like &lt;BETTER_NAVIGATION_GOES_HERE&gt; 
or &lt;CONTENT_BOT_L&gt;. Right &hellip;.&rsquo;encryption&rsquo; &amp; 
&lsquo;securing the code&rsquo; &hellip;but why is in the way that html will 
output it and be invalid.</p> 
<p>Same stuff goes to VIEW_STATE -&gt; what a piece of shit (sometimes so 
massive string, that&rsquo;s ridiculous), like the session couldn&rsquo;t be 
stored anywhere else but on website itself, right?</p> 
<p>Costs: well no discussion here. Linux done well once will server years. 
Hosting is cheaper. Basically you&rsquo;re paying for electricity &amp; no 
licensing fees. RAD stands in LAMP for what it should be. RAD in .NET makes 
things not maintainable really.</p> </li> 
<li> Ozzy on August 7th, 2009 7:38 am 
<p>@Exo</p> 
<p>ViewState can be turned off on per control, per page, etc. basis. Not a big 
deal here. If you&rsquo;re the dev, it is up to you to decide what storage 
you&rsquo;ll use &ndash; viewstate, session, etc. And the html output&hellip; I 
can provide you with 100s php sites which do not validate at all too.</p> 
<p>&quot;Shame all .NET developers are negative to language which makes 
websites more maintainable&quot;.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly .NET dev. As I said, i&rsquo;m working with both PHP 
and C#. Was working on C++ and Delphi projects. And recently started some 
Python. Among these, PHP is the worst thing i&rsquo;ve touched ever. And ppl 
were laughing on VB6?</p> 
<p>Oh, PHP sites are more maintainable? Out designers still have hard time to 
understand why the hell we&rsquo;re using a weird templating language (Smarty) 
over another templating language (PHP).</p> 
<p>To all: sorry for this offtopic reply.</p> </li> 
<li> Exo on August 7th, 2009 7:56 am 
<p>@Ozzy</p> 
<p>True, not every page, regardless to the language validates. But not every 
language works against you in this matter.</p> 
<p>AFAIK quite experienced developers had a problem to agree sessions between 
ASP &amp; .NET after turning ViewState.</p> 
<p>I think PHP is more maintainable. Syntax isn&rsquo;t weird as long as you 
have no programming preferences/fixations (it seems to me you have some strong 
ones).</p> 
<p>Designer we&rsquo;re able to pick our code after ~month and changing it as 
they want it.</p> 
<p>Smarty can be weird if you don&rsquo;t understand template engine 
principles. Template engine syntax is then really useful &amp; powerful at same 
time. But when you understand the principles, know what you exactly want, have 
plenty of time &amp; money there&rsquo;s nothing against writing your own one.
</p> 
<p>And please do not even compare Masterpage to Smarty or ZendView -&gt; KO 
would be instant.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many voices about controls. Well Zend, Code Igniter &amp; 
symphone are offering same amount of reusable libraries.</p> 
<p>After all I think we both have some strong preferences Ozzy :&gt;</p> </li>

<li> Ozzy on August 7th, 2009 8:58 am 
<p>@Exo</p> 
<p>I think you&rsquo;re missing a point here: &quot;But not every language 
works against you in this matter.&quot; ASP.NET is not a programming language 
at all. C# is Pick up ASP.NET MVC and voila, you have the full control over 
your HTML output </p> 
<p>&quot;AFAIK quite experienced developers had a problem to agree sessions 
between ASP &amp; .NET after turning ViewState&quot;</p> 
<p>Ermmm, this is a bit lame. You can&rsquo;t share sessions easily between 
two PHP apps running on the same machine too. Have you tried to share session 
between WordPress and osCommerce for example?</p> 
<p>&quot;And please do not even compare Masterpage to Smarty or ZendView -&gt; 
KO would be instant.&quot;</p> 
<p>Eh? Mate, what are you talking about? What have these 3 in common? A 
mistery&hellip;</p> 
<p>As you&rsquo;re mentioning Symphony, I think it is the best thing in the 
PHP world.</p> </li> 
<li> namespace on August 7th, 2009 9:09 am 
<p>&quot;Smarty can be weird if you don&rsquo;t understand template engine 
principles.&quot;</p> 
<p>IMO, the point was: why someone would use a templating engine over another 
templating engine </p> </li> 
<li> Exo on August 7th, 2009 9:35 am 
<p>@Ozzy</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re right &ndash; it is messy. Especially when all PHP frameworks 
are extending language, while ASP is something completely different to C#. 
Comparison then is bit out of &lsquo;range&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t you think ?</p> 
<p>&quot;You can&rsquo;t share sessions easily between two PHP apps running on 
the same machine too. Have you tried to share session between WordPress and 
osCommerce for example?&quot;</p> 
<p>Yeah, damn easy via memcache, using 
&lsquo;session_set_save_handler()&rsquo;. Hard isn&rsquo;t it ?</p> 
<p>Btw. ever hear about Masterpage &lsquo;semi-template engine&rsquo; ? If you 
were, you&rsquo;d know what I&rsquo;m speaking about.</p> 
<p>Symphony, ZF &amp; CI are three best for RAD in PHP.</p> </li> 
<li> Ozzy on August 7th, 2009 9:57 am 
<p>Oh the mighty memcached! Yes, it is very simple: run a memcached server, 
modify the code to use it properly, pray so that it will not loose your session 
data. Yes, very simple. </p> 
<p>&quot;&hellip;while ASP is something completely different to 
C#&hellip;&quot;</p> 
<p>Mate, stop it. It seems you&rsquo;re completely clueless here.</p> </li> 
<li> lol on August 7th, 2009 10:04 am 
<p>Memcache&hellip; No check for validity. No referential integrity. Memcache 
doesn&rsquo;t have locks. Memcache is not atomic. There is no authentication. 
In shared hosting, everyone on that host can read/write to your memcache 
instance.</p> 
<p>What a joke!</p> </li>

<p>PHP is the ugliest ans slowest thing in the recent world history. The logic

mean, real programming languages) </p> </li> 
<li> Kashif Imran on August 7th, 2009 11:45 am 
<p>I think ASP.NET is far better platform than PHP and an asp.net developer is 
a lot more productive than a PHP developer. What makes PHP important is all 
these existing open source applications. And if you end up using one of these 
existing apps, asp.net looses all the productivity advantage.</p> </li>

you use the MySQLConnector?</p> 
<p>Also, you&rsquo;ve got the class code you used to call framework functions

<p>Hi, This sounds interesting. Though I have never been onto PHP but as 
still. Can you also put some more effort in comparing Java and ASP.NET. I have 
recently tried Java but still I feel that micorsoft technologies are simpler 
and easy to implement. Long Live Microsoft</p> </li> 
<li> Boris Barroso on August 8th, 2009 4:43 pm 
<p>Kashif Imran. I would like to be sure if you are more productive in asp.net 
than PHP (Have you ever tried a PHP MVC framework &quot;CaePHP, CodeIgniter, 
Symfony, Zend&quot;) I can certanly say that for really simple application 
ASP.NET is way faster to develop than PHP or Rails but when the things start to 
get more complicated I would not choose ASP.NET I would go for Rails (Ruby) or 
Django (Python). Iam not sure if this comparisons PHP vs ASP.NET help. I know 
JAVA is faster than Ruby but I have seen JAVA applications converted to Rails, 
and Rails was faster, the way you code determines the speed of your application 
a lot and I can tell you that Ruby can give you a lot of happiness, (Happy

<p>This cannot be accepted as a fair, non-partisan measure. For one thing, you 
may have selected tests that, at some level of implementation, favor asp.net. 
I&rsquo;m sure the same thing could be done with PHP.</p> 
<p>Not meaning to be too skeptical here, but one wonders if MS really is 
serious about its overtures to the open-source community given these types of 
contrived comparisons touted by an MS employee who purports to be 
&quot;neutral&quot; (i.e., &quot;I love them both&quot;). Smile. Nod. Wink.</p>

<p>&quot;# If you are running an application that locks you in to Sun

scale planning. (My personal guess is that it&rsquo;s unlikely that Sun will 
markedly improve MySQL performance on Windows. )&quot;</p> 
<p>That is FUD, you are spreading. 5.3&prime;s mysql driver has better 
performance, measured on Linux. We got comments from user that they like the 
speed of the new driver (compared to libmysql, which is used with 5.2). We did 
not have any Windows users complaining, so far. You are the first and your 
results will be taken into consideration, so we will set a Windows system for 
testing trying to check the results.</p>

<p>First, a scripted language against a compiled one, the fact that you are 
even trying to compare the two makes me think you shouldn&rsquo;t be in the 
benchmarking business at all.</p> 
<p>Second, making wild statements like &lsquo;ASP.NET is universally faster 
than PHP&rsquo; without providing explicit details on how to duplicate the 
results that you posted, shows you are not a very trust worthy source.</p>

post those results.</p> </li>

<p>I also see from your web site that you are a PHP developer so I understand 
your rant.</p> 
<p>I posted all the details and the code to duplicate my tests (I guess you 
were so upset at PHP perfarmance that you missed that.)</p> 
<p>How about &ndash; instead of whining &quot;I don&rsquo;t believe thye thing

<p>2 remarks :</p> 
<p>- To the author : running PHP without an opcode cache is like running 
ASP.Net in debug mode&hellip; it&rsquo;s just &quot;not-done&quot;. Use an 
opcode cache and then compare performance of real applications, not a bunch of 
loops. You&rsquo;ll notice PHP beats ASP.Net on most levels.</p> 
<p>I would still prefer PHP over ASP.Net if it were slower&hellip; speed is 
just a small factor.</p> 
<p>- To Apfel : from PHP 5.3.0 onwards :</p> 
<p>ASP: DateTime NextWeek = new System.DateTime().AddDays(7);</p> 
<p>PHP: $secNextWeek = new DateTime()-&gt;add(new 
DateInterval(&quot;P7D&quot;));</p> </li> 
<li> Joe Stagner on August 11th, 2009 11:19 am 
<p>Wim, </p> 
<p>In fact, my LAMP host does not include op-code caching.</p> 
<p>Also, I often find ASP.NET applications in production that are running in 
debug mode.</p> 
<p>However THIS staement by you &quot;I would still prefer PHP over ASP.Net if 
it were slower&hellip; speed is just a small factor.&quot;</p> 
<p>Is the important one &ndash; for you, a performance difference of this 
amount doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p> 
<p>And &ndash; I agree !</p> </li>

<p>To suggest testing scenario to reveal all the ASP.NET/MS SQL power. What

<p>Database is the main scalability and performance issue, Page UI content is 
the second biggest performance factor in my experience &ndash; assuming no 
serious coding errors. I have been able to shave seconds off first loads with 
CSS spriting techniques, javascript packaging, and CDN.</p> 
<p>Obviously other performance gains can only be a good thing, I don&rsquo;t 
see why a newcomer would choose PHP over .NET, simply due to the depth of 
support you guys (MS) give, the size of the community and the nature of C# and 
asp syntax. It&rsquo;s one big beautiful combo.</p> </li> 
<li> Jonathon Hibbard on August 12th, 2009 9:57 am 
<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about the developer. It&rsquo;s also 
about knowing your server, optimizing it properly, and knowing how to exploit 
the resources you have.</p> 
<p>If you can code .NET to be faster, go for it. If you can code PHP to be 
faster, again, go for it. Either way, PHP has it&rsquo;s pro&rsquo;s and 
con&rsquo;s, as does .NET.</p> 
<p>This &quot;age old question&quot; about which is better has long been too 
focused on the languages and platforms. You should be looking at yourself, the 
developer, to know which one you are stronger in.</p> 
<p>That alone dictates which will perform better.</p> </li>

<p>How come your tests show it takes less to do more with ASP .NET?</p> 
<p>If I normalize your empty loops to your string assignment loops I discover 
that the first two cause a 20% increase in time consumed. But the third takes 
16% less time. Doing a simple extrapolation from 7 million to 20 million we can 
see that a do while loop doing a text assignment takes 16% less time to 
complete than when it has nothing to do. How is that?</p>

<p>I hope people actually looked at your spreadsheet, because your article is 
misleading.</p> 
<p>&quot;MySQL Access from PHP on Linux is a TINY bit faster than SQL Server 
access on Windows&quot; &ndash; I think you meant to say, &quot;is twice as 
fast&quot; as SQL Server, according to your data.</p> 
<p>&quot;MySQL access with Linux is faster by more than a little and on 
Windows&quot; &ndash; Again, you meant to say &quot;is about five times 
faster&quot;, again according to your data.</p> </li>

<p>Well the tone of article was set by the first few lines &quot;I&rsquo;m 
PAID by Microsoft to write BOTH PHP and ASP.NET Code. I was doing PHP before 
.NET shipped. I love them both.&quot;</p> 
<p>Does anyone seriously believe, a guy who is in Microsoft employment will be

Windows and mysql is generally way faster than SQL.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;No Operating System or Development Runtime performance enhancements 
were added.&quot; &ndash; yes none were added but .NET has its Global Assembly 
Cache by default.</p> 
<p>This is wrong from the start as somebody already pointed out(K I think was 
the name). For a real comparison you should have used a bytecode cache system 
for php, because the asp.net code is compiled and cached by default after the 
first request.</p> </li> 
<li> Joe Stagner on August 13th, 2009 10:30 am

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why anyone is surprised by these results. Microsoft has 
done a great job tuning their web stack/ide in recent years.</p> 
<p>I program primarily in php because my customers request it not because its 
the best thing ever. I think all technologies have their faults. The biggest 
selling point of php/mysql is the price. FREE.</p> 
<p>The other thing thats nice is unlike windows server which I have to worry 
about getting hacked/viruses all the time linux servers are extremely easy to 
secure.</p> 
<p>For Microsoft to rule the programming scene I would like to see them secure 
their operating system.. don&rsquo;t allow processes rights to files they 
don&rsquo;t need. Take security seriously be like apple and (borrow) an already 
great filesystem and make it your own.. its bsd licensing after all.</p> 
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p> </li> 
<li> Bobby Pejman on August 13th, 2009 10:04 pm 
<p>This article is not a true comparison of apples to apples simply because 
.NET has caching built in, PHP doesn&rsquo;t, by default. Also, according to 
the author, if PHP runs faster on a Windows 2008 machine than on Ubuntu 9.04, 
then this isn&rsquo;t really a battle between ASP.NET and PHP but rather 
Windows 2008 and Ubuntu 9.04 ehh??</p> 
<p>Anyone in the right mind will tell you that Ubuntu 9.04 is a much beefier 
operating system than Windows 2008. I&rsquo;ve worked with both, yes, even the 
stripped down version of Ubuntu, and it just wan&rsquo;t quite the same. How 
about you try running this on a stripped down version of *BSD system?</p> 
<p>Plus, how does anyone know what background services Ubuntu 9.04 was running 
versus MS 2008 when this benchmark was performed?</p> 
<p>Next, only true developers who understand the importance of performance, 
security and optimization will understand my point here. That is, in PHP, you 
design your own controls, your own Javascript and your own CSS to fit your 
needs for what your website&rsquo;s intended use. You also have access to this 
code to further enhance your controls and optimize it to your needs.</p> 
<p>In .NET, as we all know, everything is compiled so how would you know that 
a control you&rsquo;re throwing on your page that has JS and CSS embedded, code 
that you have no access to, is 1. Secure, 2. Optimized code for your intended 
use and 3. Performs?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll be fair here. VS2008 has done a great job creating user controls 
by wrapping JS and CSS into their IDE. And that&rsquo;s totally great and works 
best for MS developers. I&rsquo;m not a MS developer because I just don&rsquo;t 
believe in closed code.</p>

<p>Hi, Joe,</p> 
<p>Great tests !</p> 
<p>One question : The data access tests used transactions (and locks) in all 
databases ?</p> 
<p>SQL Server always uses transactions (few exceptions here), but mysql not 
always and I don&rsquo;t know about postgree in this case.</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Of course C# + asp.net is faster than PHP. IT&rsquo;S COMPILED CODE! But 
that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about when I say I prefer building web 
apps in PHP compared to asp.net. I think a better comparison is to create a web 
app in both php and asp.net. Track the time it takes to build it, the 
environment cost and the amount of traffic each one can handle. That&rsquo;s 
the TRUE test.</p> </li>

<p>This is a wonderful opinion. The things mentioned are unanimous and needs 
to be appreciated by everyone&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Nice post,</p> 
<p>Thanks for writing about it</p> </li>

<p>It would be great to apply the same test to JSP and add the result to your 
spreadsheet.</p> </li>

<p>Would it be possible for you to repeat the benchmarks with some kind of PHP 
optimizer?</p> 
<p>This type of test would only be fair if you tested classic ASP, which 
isn&rsquo;t compiled. Some PHP optimizers compile the actual script, which is 
exactly what happens with ASP.NET.</p> </li> </ol> </ul>
