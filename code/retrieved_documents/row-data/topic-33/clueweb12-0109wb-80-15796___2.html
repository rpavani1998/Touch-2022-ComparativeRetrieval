<h2>ProductCart: asp shopping cart easy to modify to better fit your needs</h2>
<h3>What's an asp shopping cart?</h3> 
<p>In many areas of our Web site we refer to ProductCart as an <em><strong>asp 
shopping cart</strong></em>. What does &quot;asp&quot; stand for? An asp 
shopping cart is an ecommerce application written in a popular programming 
language called<b>Active Server Pages</b> (ASP). Our shopping cart software is 
written in ASP.</p> 
<h3>Why ASP and not ASP.NET</h3> 
<p>Shopping carts are written in a variety of programming languages such as 
PHP, ASP.NET, Cold Fusion, Ruby, and more. Classic ASP and ASP.NET are 
completely different programming language: ASP.NET is not an evolution of 
Classic ASP, but rather a different programming language. Classic ASP is a 
scripting language, much more similar to PHP than to ASP.NET.</p> 
<p>One of the reasons our customers love ProductCart is that it's so easy to 
modify. That's because Classic ASP is one of the most accessible programming 
languages, accessible even for non-developers: Web designers that don't have a 
programming background can typically learn enough to read and modify at least 
some ASP source code rather quickly.</p> 
<p>Applied to ProductCart, this means that a Web designer working on a Web 
store powered by our shopping cart software can typically make (at least basic) 
changes to the software's source code to better meet a client's need. This 
allows Web designers to have more control on their work and provide a higher 
level of service to their customers.</p> 
<h3>Benefits of using Classic ASP</h3> 
<p>Among the benefits of using an asp shopping cart (shopping cart written in 
Classic ASP):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Your ecommerce store will run on any computer that runs IIS: not just 
Windows servers, but also Windows XP Professiona, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 
desktops on which IIS has been enabled (very easy to do). This means that you 
can run a ProductCart-powered store locally for designing, developing, and 
testing purposes, if you need to. For more details on this, seeSetting up a 
ProductCart-powered store on your desktop.</li> 
<li>ASP is fast and reliable: it's been around for over a decade and 
truckloads of Web sites run on it.</li> 
<li>The ecommerce system's ASP source code is delivered to your when you 
purchase a shopping cart license.</li> 
<li>This translates into the ability for you to have any proficient ASP 
programmer edit the source code to change existing ecommerce features or add 
new ones. For example, you can hire one of our authorized ProductCart resellers 
to create a custom ecommerce store for you. Learn more about completeecommerce 
solutions built with ProductCart.</li> 
<li>Because ASP is a very popular programming language, you will never have a 
problem finding skilled programmers that can help you customize, enhance, and 
maintain your ecommerce store. A great place to start is ourpartners page.</li> 
<li>Shopping carts written in other programming languanges often do not give 
you the ability to easily modify the system's features.</li>
