<h2>ASP vs. PHP: Understanding Differences</h2> 
<h2>BY Jordan Walker Category Digital, Inspiration</h2> <br>
<br>
 Two 
commonly used server side scripting languages implemented by aweb development 
agency are ASP (Active Server Pages) and PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor). They 
are both used to dynamically generate content on a web server, which gives 
interactive programmers and site owners the capability to add custom pragmatic 
logic, modify paragraph copy, or change the design palette.&nbsp;
<p></p> 
<p>ASP was developed by Microsoft to run in conjunction with IIS (Internet 
Information Service) on Windows Server architecture. ASP typically is paired 
with a Microsoft Sequential Query Language (MS-SQL) database. These products 
need to be purchased from Microsoft for setup.</p> 
<p>PHP is an open source library that normally runs in conjunction with Apache 
on UNIX based servers. PHP is typically paired with a MySQL database engine or 
a PostgreSQL database, which do not cost any money to use.</p> 
<p>Both server-side scripting languages have their advantages. When you are 
getting ready to evaluate your requirements, keep the following information in 
mind.</p> 
<p>Even though the learning curve for ASP is steeper than PHP, it is 
frequently used because:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>ASP is well-suited for all Microsoft software, which in the corporate 
stratosphere is exceptionally popular. Corporations use these tools to make the 
business work flow smoother on transaction based applications.</li> 
<li>Most enterprise corporations already use a variety of Microsoft software, 
like SharePoint or Microsoft Exchange server.</li> </ol> 
<p>When the attempt is made to merge application data from Microsoft based 
systems with PHP based web applications, complications can arise, so by in 
large it is avoided. The keystone for deciding to use ASP is the Microsoft 
product compatibility.</p> 
<p>Some of the reasons to use PHP are derived in part, by the amount of 
developers, designers, and programmers that currently use PHP. They find in 
comparison to ASP, that PHP is tremendously simpler. The open source library of 
PHP classes has more features, which allows web development agencies to build 
dynamically driven websites with less effort because:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Developers and users alike can create web pages that are rich with 
content, modifiable with an off the shelf management system.</li> 
<li>Hosting a PHP based application or website costs less since web hosting 
companies do not have to pay licensing fees, and is compatible with a greater 
range of server operating systems.</li> </ol> 
<p>While we build both ASP and PHP websites, we usually find that PHP is a 
good solution for most businesses because of the engaged, open source 
community. Have additional questions about which one you should use for your 
site? Let me know in the comments orContact Us.</p>
