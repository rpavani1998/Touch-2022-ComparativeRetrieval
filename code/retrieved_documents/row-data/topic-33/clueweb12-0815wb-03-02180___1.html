<h1>  Difference between PHP and ASP </h1> 
<p>  Sunday, 28 November 2010 </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>PHP and ASP are similar in function as they can perform nearly as well as 
each other.&nbsp; PHP, or Pre-Hypertext Processor, is server side software that 
can cross platform and is similar in syntax to Java or C.&nbsp; ASP or Active 
Server Pages are a basic syntax that is possible with IIS (Internet Information 
Services on Windows).&nbsp; PHP is designed to work in many environments, thus 
is compatible with both Microsoft OS Products and Linux based Operating 
Systems.&nbsp; ASP relies on the IIS service, meaning that it is native on 
Microsoft Windows but can be made compatible with Linux servers if all of the 
correct physical components are installed and registered for use. Hosting 
possibilities are mixed for both languages.&nbsp; ASP works with both Windows 
and Linux servers but will tend to fare better with the native Windows 
structure.&nbsp; Although PHP is capable of running on both server types, it 
naturally works much faster on Linux due to the low amount of resources needed 
and how much resources the operating system takes up on the server.</p> 
<h2>Comparing PHP and ASP</h2> 
<p>Both PHP and ASP are great solutions for most projects that need the server 
power and capabilities available with them.&nbsp; Both ASP and PHP have several 
tools and available options with their GUI options.PHP is capable of being 
installed quickly and easily with many tools server side which can include 
image manipulation, uploading, email systems and much more.&nbsp; ASP is 
designed to require registration of components and modules to make each tool 
possible.&nbsp; ASP will usually require paying for each component upgrade as 
well.</p> 
<p>There are noticeable speed issues between ASP and PHP.&nbsp; ASP tends to 
be slower and can handle a low amount of requests before accessibility starts 
to lag and become labored on the server.&nbsp; PHP tends to be much faster and 
can handle thousands of requests before strain begins to become an issue.&nbsp; 
When connecting to a database, ASP will tend to work better with SQL Servers 
and Access.&nbsp; Although it is capable of running MySQL, it is more difficult 
to get working on just any server.&nbsp; PHP has better accessibility to MySQL 
and other options for database connectivity.</p> 
<p>The way to figure out which is necessary for a certain type of server can 
be done with some simple deliberation on the servers.&nbsp; If the server is 
Microsoft based, then the use of ASP with options such as SQL Server should be 
considered.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the server is Linux, BSD, or any form 
of Unix, then the use of a PHP and MySQL configuration is best suited.</p> 
<p>When using ASP it is important to remember that costs behind hosting and 
all components that are needed can be exceedingly high for most budgets.&nbsp; 
PHP is much more versatile in terms of budget constraints and has a variety of 
free and opened sourced tools available for use alongside the commercial 
products as well.&nbsp; Whatever the case is for power and function, both ASP 
and PHP can perform well under their optimal configurations with a server.</p>
