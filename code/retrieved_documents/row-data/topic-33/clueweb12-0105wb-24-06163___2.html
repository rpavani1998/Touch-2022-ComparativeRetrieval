 Re: Which platform should i choose 
between ASP &amp; PHP ?  Keep in mind that most web hosting companies do not 
allowed asp server pages, only php. This might affect you in the future. <br>

 Re: Which platform should i choose between ASP &amp; PHP ?  
AndreRet - Yeah, most Linux hosts. There are *plenty* of Windows/IIS hosts also 
that support ASP.NET no problem.<br>
<br>
 I would say ASP.NET is a much better 
thing to learn especially if you want to be able to have skills that translate 
outside of web development. ASP.NET is usually written in C# or VB.NET, and if 
you learn a language like C# then you will able to write many other things 
besides websites, like Windows apps, iPhone apps, Android apps, Windows Phone 
apps, and not to mention Linux/Mac OS X apps. <br>

<br>  Re: Which platform should i choose between ASP &amp; PHP ?  ASP.NET is 
superior to PHP because PHP is a horrible language, but you can use good 
languages with ASP.NET, and there are Mono implementations, and if they're good 
then Windows licenses are not a problem. You don't need to worry about 
&quot;web hosting companies&quot; because why wouldn't you get a VPS? Exactly.
