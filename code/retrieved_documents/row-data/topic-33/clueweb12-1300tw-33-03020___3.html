<b>Location:</b> Wisconsin, 
USA  I have a pretty good grasp of basic HTML and have been learning CSS and 
some Javascript, but I think I need to know more about doing things on the 
server side. It seems like PHP, ASP, and JSP are the common language for this, 
but I'm not really sure which is going to be the best bet for me. I'm an 
experienced Windows user so ASP with SQL is going to be right up my alley, but 
I see PHP and MySQL all over the place and I've read good things about them. I 
haven't read much about JSP, but it sounds a bit interesting too.<br>
<br>
I'd 
love to hear from the TITN community about the pros and cons of these languages 
and especially from others with experience with more than one of them. What 
have you used. What do you like and dislike about it. How portable is it? Is it 
difficult to learn? <br>

<br>
just to 
clarify, when you say asp, do you mean &quot;Classic asp&quot; or 
&quot;ASP.NET&quot; as in aspx? <br>
<br>

<br>
A very 
good question, I'm going to ear mark this for later. I feel I need to give this 
some thought and it deserves a detailed answer. So I promise I will get back to 
on this! <br>

Well... either 
I guess. If I'm going to learn something new I should probably go with the 
latest and greatest, which would be ASP.NET, but if &quot;classic&quot; ASP is 
still in wide use it wouldn't hurt to consider it as well. Are you familiar 
with both and if so could you summarize the differences for me? Are there major 
advantages or disadvantages involved? <br>

<b>Posts:</b> 41  Hello encryptedbytes, <br>
<br>
As 
promised here is my answer,<em> please note these are my views only and I 
advise you do your own testing and research</em>. <br>
<br>
Having worked with 
all the technologies mentioned (bar JSP); here is the breakdown:<br>
<br>
I 
would like to make two groups:<br>
<br>
<strong>Group 1 (Open source; LAMP 
stack):</strong> <br>
<br>
This group is the PHP and MySQL combination, and 
will be typically run under Linux based servers. Of course this combination is 
not strictly the only combination. One example could be a WAMP stack: using a 
Windows based OS with PHP and MySQL.<br>
<br>
Of course PHP can be used with 
any SQL solution, and could be used with Microsoft SQL Server. However this is 
not the norm.<br>
<br>
In this group there is also the &quot;Java stack&quot; 
JSP and it is also cross platform.<br>
<br>
<strong>Group 2 (Closed source; MS 
stack):</strong> <br>
<br>
In this group are Classical ASP and ASP.NET along 
with MS SQL server. Once again, ASP.NET can also be used with MySQL (as MySQL 
is cross platform). However this is a rare combination.<br>
<br>
Although via 
the &quot;Mono&quot; project one can technically run ASP.NET platform under 
Linux, its not a very popular combination.<br>
<br>
Your first choice should 
depend in what you want to work with, open source (free) or closed source 
(paid).<br>
<br>
Once you have made this choice, here are the details of each 
technology from my perspective:<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP and MySQL</strong> <br>

<br>It is cross platform and free. In terms of PHP from a development 
perspective it has a &quot;Double Edged&quot; sword effect:<br>
<br>
In one 
sense it is incredibly easy to do common things (90% of most web application 
functions, eg send email, connect to database, parse data etc).<br>
<br>

However this &quot;ease&quot; of use comes at a major cost, the Language is a
<strong>total failure</strong>. If you look at the history behind the birth of 
PHP one can understand why this is the case. In fairness, PHP has come a long 
way and has strived in each release to &quot;improve&quot; the many many 
language design issues.<br>
<br>
However it is an uphill struggle, because it 
started of from the wrong foot!<br>
<br>
The other problem is one of 
&quot;barrier to entry&quot;; because its so &quot;easy&quot; to 
&quot;learn&quot; PHP. This has meant that a lot of &quot;non developers&quot; 
or people who have NO formal training as professionally programmers get into 
&quot;web development&quot;.<br>
<br>
The results have been a disastrous, the 
industry has been effected in a NEGATIVE way, of course one can not put 100% 
blame on PHP alone it is far more complex than that.<br>
<br>
It is for this 
reason that most professional developers look with &quot;disapproval&quot; when 
it comes to PHP.<br>
<br>
The other issue is that security is not 
&quot;default&quot;, in other words one has to actively know what they are 
doing to avoid serious security issues.<br>
<br>
The other problem is 
&quot;Spaghetti Code&quot; this is when SQL, Business Logic, and Presentation 
Logic are all mashed into one place. This is a huge problem because this 
reduces maintainability; readability and makes it very difficult to extent etc. 
It takes GREAT care and experienced and highly competent developers to create 
very clean and highly maintainable code.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is for this very 
reason that as of late many &quot;Web Frameworks&quot; have become so 
incredibly popular. They are created to solve this very issue of 
&quot;separation of concerns&quot;.<br>
<br>
However frameworks, invariably 
become yet another layer of abstraction. Adding a new layer of abstraction will 
mean that as long as what you have in mind is within the strictures of the 
framework then all is possible. However if you require to do something that is 
outside of the scope of the framework; then you will have to battle with the 
framework in order to do what you want to achieve.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>In 
Summary:</em></strong> <br>
<br>
<b>Quote:</b>  Using PHP, is like driving a 
fast racing car, without any safety gear, no helmets, no harness. It takes a 
master driver to race such a car.<br>
<br>
Inexperienced drivers will go fast, 
however they will also likely crash it and die in a blazing inferno.<br>
<br>

<br> <strong>ASP/ASP.NET and SQL Server</strong> <br>
<br>
//TODO <br>
<br>

Sorry I will post the rest later! <br>

What an excellent, well thought out, and informative post! <br>
<br>
This already gives me something to &quot;chew on&quot;, so thanks for that. I'm 
sure others here will find this all very informing as well, thank you very much 
for laying it out so well!<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to the next part 
covering the ASP/closed source end of the equation, but no need to be in a 
rush, there are several points to consider already in the PHP/open source 
information that you've posted. <br>

<br> <br>
<strong>ASP.NET and SQL Server</strong> <br>
<br>
ASP.NET <em>(which 
should not be confused with classic ASP)</em> are both Microsoft propriety 
closed source web technologies.<br>
<br>
Classic ASP is outdated and could be 
thought of as Microsoft&rsquo;s first attempt at web server side technology. It 
is script based<em>(Visual Basic or Jscript)</em> and executes on the server. 
<br> <br>
I will not discuss further regarding classic ASP since it is really 
already legacy tech, and unless you have a very specific reason to learn it<em>
(supporting legacy system)</em> then you are advised against it. <br>
<br>
In 
order to understand ASP.NET and how its related eco system fit in, you first 
need to understand what &ldquo;.NET&rdquo; is.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;.NET&rdquo; in a 
one-liner explanation can be thought of as Microsoft&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;answer&rdquo; to Java. If you are aware of how conceptually Java works 
then &ldquo;.NET&rdquo; has many similar parallels.<br>
<br>
.NET is a very 
large topic and I can&rsquo;t do it justice in this small write-up and I highly 
suggest you read up on this topic for further information. However I can give 
you a brief idea.<br>
<br>
.NET has two parts, first there is the Virtual 
Machine called the CLR<em>(Common Language Runtime)</em>. The second part is 
the BCL<em>(Base Class Library)</em>. The BCL provides a common set of 
libraries to handle the usual software tasks such as graphics processing and 
file handling.<br>
<br>
The .NET platform allows multiple languages to target 
the CLR, this is done by first compiling source could to MSIL<em>(Microsoft 
Intermediate Language)</em>, which can then be turned into highly optimised CLR 
byte code.<br>
<br>
In theory at least, not only is the .NET platform language 
agnostic<em>(having over 40 languages)</em> but also OS independent <em>(via 
mono project)</em>. However in reality it is almost always run in a Windows 
environment.<br>
<br>
ASP.NET is simply a &ldquo;Web Framework&rdquo; that uses 
the .NET platform to power it. This means one can share code across different 
domains<em>(example, desktop application classes could be used in web 
application projects and vice versa)</em>. <br>
<br>
Unlike PHP and other 
server side scripting technologies, ASP.NET are source compiled, which means 
that they are very efficient for creating CPU demanding web applications.<br>

<br>ASP.NET currently comes in two &ldquo;camps&rdquo;, one is the 
&ldquo;established winforms&rdquo; and other is the fairly newer 
&ldquo;MVC&rdquo; ala Ruby/Python inspired web framework.<br>
<br>
Both use the 
exact same underlying technology, however are abstracted differently. In the 
WinForms world, the abstraction is an event based paradigm<em>(those coming 
from a desktop programming environment will be very familiar with this)</em>. 
As such WinForms developers must understand &ldquo;Page Cycles&rdquo; in order 
to effectively develop web application.<br>
<br>
ASP.NET provides a whole host 
of advanced features such as Custom Controls, Global .asax handlers, Generic 
Handles, Master Pages, and many other features to build enterprise level 
systems. In terms of security generally speaking unless the developer is 
extremely &ldquo;sloppy&rdquo; than it is fairly secure &ldquo;out of the 
box&rdquo;.<br>
In terms of tooling, it is really mature and feature complete. 
Almost the entire development can be done from inside of Visual Studio<em>(the 
.NET IDE)</em>. <br>
<br>
However it is not all &ldquo;sunshine and 
rainbows&rdquo;. There are also many downsides: It is not really cross 
platform, picking ASP.NET means you are effectively tied to the Microsoft 
Platform. It is paid software; you will need to pay for licences for commercial 
uses.<br>
<br>
It is not open source, and Microsoft has an aggressive 
development cycle, constantly updating and changing the technologies.<br>
<br>

It&rsquo;s far more complex, sometimes it may even be overkill if you want to 
do simple things. In such cases, PHP or even classic ASP would be much better 
suited.<br>
<br>
<strong>In summary:</strong> <br>
<br>
<b>Quote:</b>  ASP.NET 
is like an advanced spacecraft, it has all the advanced bells and whistle.<br>

But if you want to do something really fast and really simply and for free then 
this is not it. <br>

Thanks so much for taking the time to follow 
up on your previous post with the other part of the equation, you've really 
laid out the differences and advantages/disadvantages in a very accessible way 
and have given me a good understanding of the major factors in deciding which 
way to go. I'm sure others here will find yours posts quite informative as well.
<br> <br>
Despite being primarily a Windows user, my initial thoughts are to go 
the PHP/MySQL route. I like the idea of open-source and free and also get a 
sense that PHP/MySQL will be easier to digest and get familiar with.<br>
<br>

Before committing to a particular path I'll likely &quot;sleep on it&quot; and 
return to your posts a couple more times to be (more) sure I am heading in the 
direction best suited to me. Again, thanks for your efforts! <br>

Hello encryptedbytes, <br>
<br>
No need to thank me <br>
<br>Even if my post was of some benefit to someone then I feel I'm following 
the IT Ninja's main ethos!<br>
<br>
Reading back my post, I know there are 
biases, this was not intentional but a side effect of working on one tech more 
than another.<br>
<br>
I would add further, that <strong>another option</strong>
 would be to actually learn both.<br>
<br>
In my view this would be a more 
advantageous option, because both technologies have a lot to offer. <br>

It's the least I can do for your efforts. In <em>some</em>
 online communities it can be difficult to get a response to these kinds of 
questions, and often it becomes a debate between the respondents, leaving the 
asker more confused than they were to begin with. I'm glad to have found a 
place like TITN with members such as yourself!<br>
<br>
 Mark73 wrote:  I know 
there are biases... <br>
I don't think a little opinion mixed in with the fact 
is going to hurt anyone. Because your opinion is based on experience I think it 
is both relevant and valuable. It's when opinion supersedes the information 
that the message gets lost and little or nothing is actually<em>learned</em>. 
<br> <br>

This would be ideal. 
Unfortunately there is only so much time and far too many areas of interest to 
cover all the bases so I must try to choose wisely. Who knows though... maybe 
after getting my feet wet with one I may develop an interest in going even 
further and start looking into the other. <br>
