Description: <br>

<br> 
<h2>If you want to add more power and functionality to your Web sites, add 
some database applications like a powerful shopping cart or a fun quiz game. 
Such applications make your site more dynamic, allow you to gather information, 
and provide customized experiences for your visitors. Creating Database Web 
Applications with PHP and ASP teaches beginning and intermediate designers the 
fundamentals of creating complex Web applications. By covering both open source 
(PHP/MySQL) and proprietary tools (Microsoft ASP and Access), readers gain 
insight to the strengths and weaknesses of each. In addition, they learn how to 
work with both sets of tools and determine which works best for their projects. 
Practical examples, including a shopping cart and quiz show, are used to teach 
the basic concepts behind creating and testing database code. Every example is 
also provided in both PHP and ASP for easy comparison and use. With the 
knowledge and experience gained here, beginners will learn the fundamental 
concepts behind these two technologies, while more experienced developers will 
learn which technology works best for their specific needs. Exercises, 
questions, and projects are included with each chapter.</h2> <br>

Not perfect, 
but a perfect mix!Feb 16, 2004<br>
<br>
I'm a seasoned (some would say salty) 
web developer, and I have been teaching web applications for two years both 
online and &quot;on the ground.&quot; I've looked in vain for the right mixture 
of theory, practical application and humor (a needed ingredient for this type 
of instruction). I use this book for intermediate web developer students who 
have a solid grounding in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and some basic knowledge of 
either PHP or ASP (or other programming logic). I used to use Wrox's Beginning 
ASP, but at more than 1000 pages, and more errata than I could cover in a 
single class, I continued looking. With this book, I think I've found the right 
text for some of the classes I teach!
<p>Dr. Meyer's work starts with a review of HTML and Javascript, with an 
emphasis on how to use the DOM in an application setting. Regarding databases, 
there are chapters explaining application concepts and E-R diagrams, as well as 
how to use the CLI client for MySQL. The CD-ROM even has SQL instructions for 
importing the material from the text; and for Access users, db files that 
mirror the work in the text.</p>
<p>But the real heart of the matter is the instruction in coding practices, 
from reading and writing to databases (using MySQL and DSN-less Access 
connections), to using cookies and session variables for data persistance. And 
this is where this book has no equal: it supports both the hugely popular 
open-source PHP/MySQL as equally as it shows ASP and Access. I've never seen 
such a universal attempt pulled off quite as well.</p>
<p>I recommend the book, but no work is perfect. I don't think that a book can 
equal the combination of education and experience (but as an instructor, I may 
be biased). The PHP code supplied in the accompanying CD-ROM utilizes global 
variables (which may be turned off in some production environments for security 
purposes)--but that underscores the use of the text as a textbook, and not a 
coding &quot;cookbook&quot; with samples that are &quot;ready-to-eat.&quot; 
Also, the ASP uses the less-common, but more palatable ASP JavaScript (or 
JScript) instead of the more commonly utilized ASP VBScript (but even 
third-party ASP interpreters like that used in the SunOne Server handled the 
code).</p>
<p>I found that students should adapt and improve the code from the CD-ROM as 
part of their studies, so that they could fix some typos, and learn how code 
integration works. Also, they needed to create interfaces for the samples so we 
could stop staring at web forms and add some color to the examples! Students 
have created portfolio pieces using the concepts in this text like 
psychological profile tests, e-commerce sites, calendar applications and 
marketing surveys.<br>

Terrific, concise book on learning atabase Web applicationsFeb 15, 2004<br>
<br>
I am very new to computing, having just learned the basics of HTML. I found 
this book very helpful. First of all, it does start out with basic HTML which 
was reassuring for me. It then adds JavaScript. It builds up gradually, with 
many examples in the text. There is also a complete set of code on the CD. The 
PHP with MySql and the ASP with Access are always compared with general 
previews. The book has many screen shots.</p>
<p>The book also has some examples of what the screen would look like if you 
did something wrong which beginners tend to do. I have not seen this 
pedagogical technique in other texts. I found it very helpful. The chapters on 
database design and SQL were also very good. I strongly recommend this book. It 
is an excellent book for anyone new to Web applications or someone with some 
experience, who wants to know more. In particular, if someone knows one of the 
technologies featured (PHP, ASP, MySql, Access, SQL) and wants to know how this 
one technology relates to others, this is a good source. The examples of the 
book are well-chosen, without any extraneous material, and are explained in a 
table, with code in one column and explanation in another. I liked the fact 
that that it is clear and concise since I like most people don't have a lot of 
time to expend on a lot of unnecessary verbiage.<br>
<br>
not as good as Larry 
UllmanFeb 09, 2008<br>
 By twets<br>
While this book covers both ASP and PHP 
coding and the use of MySQL and ACCESS, the author does little to explain the 
'why' behind much of the coding. This means that using the coding is not as 
straightforward as she would like it to be.<br>
<br>
To start a book with the 
basics of HTML and then take a user through to complex database design would 
require more explanation and peripheral information.<br>
<br>
I find that Larry 
Ullman's books provide far better explanations of the coding and help the user 
to understand how the coding fits in with a) the rest of the coding on the page 
and b) the coding that relates to subsequent pages.<br>
<br>
I used this book 
as a textbook in a class, and most students encountered similar problems. If 
someone were to purchase this book, I strongly recommend another more hands-on 
book in tandem with it.<br>

<br>Very helpfulFeb 16, 2004<br>
 By John Anthony<br>
Jeanine,</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know how helpful your book is. Before I thought, it 
was impractical to have two scripting languages and two databases. I said this 
because from my experience I started learning database from Access then learn 
Visual Basic Codes and Scripts. Originally, my field of profession is Financial 
Accounting. In the early 1990's I learn Lotus then migrated to Excel 
spreadsheet programs. I was not satisfied for what macros can do so I studied 
Access database. I was so amazed by it but there are things I know and hope 
will make things easier and faster. I wanted to learn SQL knowing how powerful 
it is, but how expensive commerialize DBMS softwares were it made me stick with 
Access. The internet period has arrived at that time, so I learned ASP with 
Visual Basic Scripting. I was still not comfortable &amp; not happy with it 
because VBScript is always tied up with a giant corporation and at the time I 
was learning HTML, XML &amp; JavaScript.<br>
<br>
This made me confuse what 
direction am I going but continue what I learned so far, apply it then and 
whatever will make it easier. So, I studied ASP with JavaScript langauge. 
Consequently, from learning and experience, I read about MySQL and PHP and 
studied it as well. So far your book is the best and most helpful, in showing 
how to connect to a server and for sure will SAVE me and my clients alot. 
Currently, I am a financial administrator and partly the intranet designer of a 
university in San Francisco. My goal is to be a free lance web designer and to 
own a Web design company using MySQL (OPEN SOURCE database), PHP (OPEN SOURCE 
scripting language), Access database, and Active Server Pages (ASP).</p>
<p>Thank you again and more power to you.</p>
