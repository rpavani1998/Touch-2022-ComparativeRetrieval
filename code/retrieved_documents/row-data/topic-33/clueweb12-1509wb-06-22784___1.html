<h1>ASP, PHP and SQL</h1> 
<p><b>ASP (Active Server Pages) </b>is a Microsoft server-side scripting 
engine also referred to as classic ASP. The key elements of ASP include objects 
that interface to backend databases, session and application states, and 
request and response parameters. An ASP web page consists of static elements, 
such asHTML tags, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as VBScript code. The VBScript 
code interacts with the ASP objects to dynamically generate HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript, which are returned to the client along with the static content. In 
a typical usage scenario, the client requests product information from the ASP 
page on the server, and the ASP page fetches the product information from the 
database and programmatically generates HTML code to present the retrieved 
product information in the client browser. For more about ASP, go toWikipedia or
ASP on MSDN.</p> 
<p>A more recent Microsoft innovation is <b>ASP.NET</b>, which provides a 
robust application development framework in addition to the basic functionality 
defined above for ASP. Server-side scripting can be done with any of the .NET 
languages, such as VB.NET or C-Sharp, and support for code behind files allows 
for clean separation between HTML markup and executable code. ASP.NET also 
introduces the notion of server-side controls and transparent maintenance of 
property states for these controls across multiple page refreshes. The 
server-side controls include things such as tables, menus, and other user 
interface objects that simplify the creation of web pages. The latest version 
of ASP.NET also includes integrated support forAjax, simplifying the task of 
developing Rich Internet Applications.<br>
<b></b></p> 
<p><b>PHP</b> is a scripting language that plays a role very similar to ASP in 
the non-Windows web application server world. As with ASP, PHP can be embedded 
in HTML and can dynamically generate web pages in response to client requests. 
There are a variety of other languages that play similar server-side roles such 
as Java, Perl, Python and Ruby. These languages can be used within the context 
of an application framework to provide ASP.NET-like capabilities. Popular 
application frameworks include Ruby on Rails, FUSE, and Drupal, for example.

<br>
<b>SQL (Structured Query 
Language)</b> is used for programmatically creating, updating, and reading 
databases. Two of the most commonly used backend database systems, SQL Server 
and MySQL, both use the SQL query language. When using ASP, ASP.NET, PHP or 
other languages, the SQL query syntax is used as an input parameter to a 
request to extract information from the database. SeeWikipedia or SQL 
fundamentals on About.com.<br>
<br>
Testing dynamically generated data-driven 
web pages adds an additional layer of complexity, requiring closed looped 
testing where client-side requests are triggered against a known data set, with 
a clear expectation of the resultant web page.<br>
