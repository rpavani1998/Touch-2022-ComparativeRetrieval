<h2>Integrating Facebook Platform to DMXReady CMS Suite Using ASP</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 11:03:38 AM&nbsp; Friday, January 27, 
2012</p> Integrating with Facebook into your website &#150; specifically 
Facebook Platform &#150; is full of advantages. For one, it allows your 
visitors to log into restricted areas of your website using only their Facebook 
account &#150; if they are logged in at Facebook, they are logged in on your 
website, making it easier for them to access your content while you maintain 
control.<br>
<br>
Facebook is also full of user information and personalization 
tools so you can create a better, more individualized experience for your users 
(http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/). <br>
<br>
Larry Boeldt at 
The Code Project has published his own ASP solution
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/94067/Classic-ASP-Integration-with-Facebook-Websites-Fea
. This tutorial teaches ASP programmers (do-it-yourselfers and professionals 
alike &#150; all the scripts are cut and paste&#133;) how to integrate Facebook 
features like Authentication, Social Plugins, and more into their websites. Of 
course, that includes websites built with DMXReady CMS and CMS Suite.<br>
<br>

It also is interesting in the fact that despite all the naysayers out there, 
ASP is actually here to stay. As of this writing, Larry&#146;s post had over 
130,000 page views and the script was downloaded over 1,500 times! (In other 
words, reports of ASP&#146;s death have been greatly exaggerated.)<br>
<br>

<h2>Facebook Authentication vs. Members Only Manager</h2>Of course, DMXReady 
CMS Suite comes with its own authentication software, namely Members Only 
Manager. So why would you use the Facebook solution over this one? It&#146;s 
very possible that you do not. Connecting via Facebook allows you to access 
personalized information from your visitors (if they allow it) to provide them 
with a better social experience. But you are also providing Facebook an 
indirect way to track your website. Since Facebook &#147;follows&#148; its 
users to your site and registers each authentication, it can do things like 
estimate the number of users your website has based on the number of Facebook 
members who visit your site.<br>
<br>
So if you do not want to install what is 
essentially a Facebook tracking cookie on your website, then Members Only 
Manager is your best bet. For many users though, sharing website user 
information with Facebook is a small price to pay for a slick interface and 
integration with Facebook Platform and all its features.<br>

<h2>Got Windows? Here&#146;s an ASP CMS Solution for You&#133;</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 1:52:27 PM&nbsp; Wednesday, January 
18, 2012</p> Since Bill Gates wrote his first line of code, the goal of 
improving software has been simple: make it faster, easier, and better for 
people to do what they want to do with their computers.
<p>Flash forward 35-odd years, and it almost seems like the software 
developers of the world are out to do the complete opposite. For example,in 
this day and age, you shouldn&#146;t need to be a computer science major to 
build a basic website &#150; or install a Content Management System for that 
matter!</p> 
<p>One major source of frustration for companies on Windows servers who want 
to move to a Content Management System (CMS) is the fact that most are 
PHP-based. Joomla, Drupal, and others run on Linux servers, not Windows servers.
</p> 
<p>DMXReady CMS Suite on the other hand is an ASP CMS, so it runs natively on 
your Windows server including Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, 
guaranteed. (If you don&#146;t have your own server, you can also run DMXReady 
CMS Suite on popular web hosting services like GoDaddy, 1and1 Hosting, 
Rackspace, Hostgator, etc.)</p> 
<p>Not only that, DMXReady CMS Suite has a whole host of plug-in applications 
like Members Only Manager and Contact Us Manager pre-loaded. You simply turn 
them on and off on the pages you want &#150; no more fumbling with applications 
that don&#146;t quite work together!</p> 
<p>Best of all, DMXReady CMS Suite is easy to use. It comes with several 
design options built in or you can easily skin it as well, using any 
third-party design template. It also comes with pre-formatted business website 
templates. That means you don&#146;t have to create pages or worry about 
mapping out your site from scratch &#150; just fill each pre-built page with 
your own content and images, and click &#145;Save&#146;!</p> 
<p>And like any CMS, updating and adding new content is a snap using any 
standard web browser. You also have the flexibility of modifying it right down 
to the code level &#150; this ASP CMS has 100% customizable source code.</p> 
<p>In short, you get everything anyone would need to run a modern and 
professional business automation CMS website.</p> 
<h2>ASP vs. PHP &#150; What is Better?</h2> 
<p>You&#146;ll hear many programmers around the Internet going on about how 
PHP is better than ASP. Usually their arguments run along the lines that 
because so many more people are using PHP, it is by default better.</p> 
<p>This is simply not true. There are several reasons why you would choose ASP 
over PHP. Many programmers prefer ASP because it is easier to code (and is much 
less complex than .Net) &#150; in fact if you are a beginner yourself, ASP is 
often the best choice because you can learn faster. It&#146;s a great choice 
for website owners who either want to learn how to code themselves, or who want 
to &#147;set it and forget it&#148; when it comes to building and launching a 
website.</p> 
<p>But as mentioned above, if you&#146;re already on a Windows server, ASP is 
your best bet in web software. And when it comes to ASP CMS, nobody does it 
better than DMXReady.</p> 
<p>Try the online demo right now and see how easy it is to use DMXReady CMS 
Suite! </p>

<h2>Using DMXReady CMS Suite as Your Landing Page Manager</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 9:39:33 AM&nbsp; Tuesday, January 03, 
2012</p> Landing pages are great things, though they can get a little unwieldy 
&#150; especially if you already have a big website. It gets even more 
complicated when you have landing pages for multiple ad campaigns like QR 
Codes, Google AdWords, banner links, and more. With split testing, different 
offers for different markets, different price codes, etc., that can easily add 
up to thousands of pages. If you&#146;re editing straight HTML pages with 
Dreamweaver and uploading them to the server, managing all those pages can 
quickly become a logistical nightmare.<br>
<br>
But not with DMXReady CMS 
Suite. First of all, you don&#146;t have to use Dreamweaver at all &#150; 
everything including the code can be modified in your own Admin pages using any 
standard web browser. (That being said, you may prefer to do the initial design 
template using Dreamweaver or some other HTML editor. But the point is, you 
don&#146;t have to fire it up every time you create a new page.)<br>
<br>
Most 
importantly though, with DMXReady CMS Suite your pages are neatly listed and 
labeled in one spot so you can easily manage your pages. Editing, adding new 
pages, deleting old ones, or disabling suspended pages/campaigns becomes much, 
much easier!<br>
<br>
Also, with the built-in Site Builder, you can break down 
and organize your campaigns any way you want. You can also modify different 
templates to use with different campaigns or even product types. The 
possibilities are endless &#150; you can create different variations for each 
catalog/category/type/product/campaign/etc., all with unique menu navigation, 
content, and css skin.<br>
<br>
For example, if you find that your purple 
widgets are selling better with the contact information along the side, and the 
red widgets are selling better with the contact information at the bottom, no 
problem &#150; you can use a different page layout/template for each. Again, 
this makes it much easier to manage your landing pages, customizing each page 
to suit its own individual strengths.<br>
<br>
Even though (or perhaps because) 
it is meant to be a full website CMS, you couldn&#146;t design a better landing 
page management application. You have full customization control over every 
aspect of your landing pages, no matter how complex or different each 
individual landing page is.<br>
<br>
Best of all, you can use DMXReady CMS 
Suite on your current domain* and it won&#146;t interfere with your main 
website. The Suite will run in the background, making your landing pages easier 
to manage without affecting your website in any way.<br>
<br>
In short, 
DMXReady CMS Suite gives you:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Ease of use &#150; all pages are listed right in front of you</li> 
<li>Flexibility &#150; create as many different templates as you need for your 
landing pages</li> 
<li>Greater organization &#150; break down each campaign by project, 
department, type, product etc. by creating your own organizational system</li> 
<li>Built-in Admin pages &#150; do it all online using any standard web 
browser &#150; no more firing up Dreamweaver or messing with FTP programs!</li> 
<li>A full CMS landing page management solution that runs on your domain, but 
doesn&#146;t interfere with your current website</li> </ul> <br>

<h2>Want to Keep It Separate? You Can&#133;</h2>Some people are worried that 
if you host your landing pages on your current web domain, there is always the 
chance that your visitors will stumble upon them accidentally. Perhaps an even 
larger worry for these people is that Google could find duplicate content on 
your landing pages and might penalize your page ranking for it.<br>
<br>
You 
can address these concerns by moving your landing pages to a separate domain 
&#150; and still use DMXReady CMS Suite.<br>
<br>
Say for example your current 
website is XYZCompany.com and you have a landing page campaign to generate 
traffic to your pages advertising a newer, better, purple widget. You can set 
up a separate website called XYZCompanyPurpleWidget.com and install DMXReady 
CMS Suite as your landing page manager. Here you can create as many pages as 
you want &#150; with as much duplicate content as you want &#150; and never get 
penalized. In fact, you could no-index the whole website, and not lose any link 
juice or page ranking on your main site.<br>
<br>
Then no matter how you direct 
your website visitors to those pages, you can rest assured they are getting the 
targeted content you designed just for them without Google &#150; or stray 
visitors &#150; stumbling upon it accidentally.<br>
<br>
This is also a great 
solution for those with hosting packages that do not support Windows/ASP.<br>

<br> http://v2suite.dmxready.com/?page=features <br>
<br>
*DMXReady CMS Suite 
requires a Windows or cloud server that will support ASP. <br>

<h2>DMXReady CMS Suite Launched!</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 12:05:15 PM&nbsp; Tuesday, December 
20, 2011</p>

owners are looking for a website solution that they can build themselves, 
allowing them full control and avoiding huge web designer bills.<br>
With 
DMXReady CMS Suite (v2), business owners win on both counts.<br>
<br>
DMXReady 
CMS Suite offers a brand new approach to website building: CMS templates. 
We&#146;re not just talking traditional HTML design templates here, but turnkey 
CMS website solutions complete with:<br>

<ul> 
<li>dynamically controlled navigation menu, site map and pages</li> 
<li>content management tools for super fast content editing using ANY 
web-enabled device including laptops, iPad/android tablets, smart phones, etc.
</li> 
<li>built-in business automation, ecommerce, CRM, and SEO apps &#150; all 
ready to go</li> </ul> No programming required &#150; web owners can simply

well as other resources like an Online Knowledgebase and links to other trusted 
information. With all the tutorials and support available, do-it-yourself 
website design has never been easier.<br>
<br>
This is a system that brings 
everything you need for your business into one integrated website solution.<br>

<br>DMXReady CMS Suite comes with 10 pre-built website templates for a variety 
of businesses and organizations including Software Vendor, Design Company, 
Charity, and more. All you have to do is choose the template that most closely 
matches your business, add your own content, and you&#146;re ready to go.<br>

<br> 
<h2>Why Now is a Good Time to Upgrade Your Website to DMXReady CMS Suite </h2>
There are many, many different scenarios in which DMXReady CMS Suite can help 
businesses, non-profits, and individuals get the most from their website.<br>

<br>For example, imagine you own a consultation business. Currently, you might 
have a typical brochure-type website that gives basic information to the 
customer, but still relies on you to do most of the work.<br>
<br>
But with 
DMXReady CMS Suite, you can take the CMS template and create a dynamic online 
experience for your customers, plus cut down on the amount of work you have to 
do. Your website becomes like your personal assistant!<br>
<br>
Automate 
contacts &#150; Send auto replies, direct emails to different 
departments/people, and mass email everyone on your customer list about early 
bird specials, new products/services, or perhaps a monthly newsletter.<br>
<br>

Centralize your info &#150; Provide information about the company as well as 
hard-to-find information for your customers, relevant news, video tutorials, 
and more.<br>
<br>
Use third-party apps to extend functionality &#150; For 
example, if you do all your bookings using Google Calendar, you can display it 
on your website with one line of code you cut and paste &#150; great for 
marking important dates relevant to your business, like launch dates or 
upcoming information sessions. You can also add other social media apps like 
Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, YouTube and others to your CMS website instantly.
<br> <br>
Accept money/payments through the website &#150; Instead of handling 
thousands of dollars of cash, you can automate service contract payments, 
charge for work and materials, and create other payment systems by connecting 
directly to your PayPal Merchant account.<br>
Using one of the built-in CMS 
templates, you can also:<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Publish photographs and videos as a portfolio or for tutorials</li> 
<li>Write a blog about your area of consultation</li> 
<li>Password-protect some or all of your website for subscription-based and/or 
&#147;customer-only&#148; content</li> 
<li>Create a staff directory</li> </ul>

<h2>Why Not Classic ASP Indeed?</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 2:08:02 PM&nbsp; Tuesday, October 27, 
2009</p> 
<p>Not long ago, we read this post called &#147;Why not Classic (Legacy) 
ASP?&#148;http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/why-not-classic-legacy-asp/ about 
(basically) the pros and cons of programming in Classic ASP.</p> 
<p>To recap the post, Steve was replying to a letter he received from an 
unnamed programmer asking why Steve no longer thought the Classic ASP framework 
was worth developing for. In his letter, the programmer said this:</p> 
<p>&#147;Here's my thinking: HTTP is stateless. All you need the framework to 
do is talk to your database and render clean HTML. That's it. All UI 
interactivity should be handled on the browser in JavaScript, and all design 
should be handled in CSS. Classic ASP (with the help of jQuery) makes all this 
SO EASY.&#148;</p> 
<p>We agree completely, especially for the small business owner&#146;s 
website. Despite Steve&#146;s obvious experience and well thought out answers, 
we think that this is a key area of use that Steve Smith overlooked.</p> 
<p>Classic ASP applications are perfect for the do-it-yourselfer and the small 
business owner who do not need large, enterprise-software-sized solutions. 
(However, it is important to note that there are many large websites out there 
that do use Classic ASP, likewww.futureshop.ca and http://edsitement.neh.gov/) 
</p> 
<p>In fact these SOHO and SME owners are exactly the people who DMXReady is 
trying to help.</p> 
<p>If you are a small business owner who wants a dynamic website or CMS 
solution, you don&#146;t need a huge database capable of handling thousands of 
hits at a time. You are most likely concerned about:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ease of use</li> 
<li>Ease of customization (sometimes)</li> 
<li>A solution that is ready-to-go &#147;right out of the box&#148;</li> </ul> 
<p>That&#146;s what Classic ASP applications offer, and that&#146;s why 
DMXReady has stuck with Classic ASP-based programming.</p> 
<p>With DMXReady, you don&#146;t need to set up a separate database because 
the built-in Microsoft Access database simply uploads with your application and 
&#147;installs itself&#148;. Plus, if you need to make some minor tweaks to the 
open source code, it is generally easier to learn Classic ASP than other 
&#147;advanced&#148; programming languages (in fact many of our customers say 
that they learned programming from customizing our apps!)</p> 
<p>So it really is an easy solution &#150; purchase the application, upload, 
and use. For those who want to play under the hood, that option is available to 
you too.</p> 
<p>Here&#146;s the thing in a nutshell: ask programmers what they prefer to 
program in, and 99% will say something other than Classic ASP-based frameworks. 
It's almost like it's mandatory for &#147;serious&#148; programmers to 
pooh-pooh Classic ASP to keep their street cred. (For the record, we don&#146;t 
believe that&#146;s the case for Steve here &#150; usually the bashing comes 
from programmers who have never worked with ASP.)</p> 
<p>But ask non-programmers what programming language they prefer, and 
they&#146;ll usually say &#147;What? Who cares? I just want something that is 
easy to use, and works.&#148;</p> 
<p>Classic ASP fulfills both those needs &#150; and we would argue it fulfills 
them better than other programming languages. That&#146;s why we&#146;ve stuck 
with it, and that&#146;s why we continue to believe in it.</p> 
<p>Be sure to check out the whole discussion on Steve Smith&#146;s website 
here:</p>

<p>This month, DMXReady introduced CMS (Lite) v2, the free version of our 
flagship application. This gives you all (well okay, most) of the power of the

<p>However it still has most of the functionality like:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Create Customizable URLs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Skin Using Wordpress Themes &amp; other 3rd Party Website 
Templates&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Plugin DMXReady v2 Apps &amp; Accessories&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<h2>Protect Yourself from Hackers</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 7:58:41 AM&nbsp; Wednesday, January 
21, 2009</p> If you build websites long enough, especially database-driven 
websites, chances are you will be hacked one day. It's not just small 
businesses either. Banks, utilities, even military websites can be safe. 
Nothing is 100% guaranteed to keep a hacker out.<br>
<br>
Luckily, the majority 
of hackers are in it just for fun and don't do any real damage. But that's just 
like a burglar coming into your home and not stealing anything -- it is still 
not a nice feeling.<br>
<br>
Last week, some DMXReady customers were the focus 
of an apparently worldwide attack. A &quot;public service&quot; hacker decided 
to let us know about a vulnerability by hacking into the Admin pages (we would 
have preferred an email, btw...)<br>
<br>
The DMXReady Team was on it 
immediately of course and we have already released a patch for it. Check your 
Order History on the DMXReady site to download and upgrade patches for your 
applications.<br>
<br>
But this does bring up an interesting issue. It seems 
that sites that had server-side security and off-root databases were not 
attacked -- at least not successfully. DMXReady has always recommended that you 
take advantage of server-side security and move your databases to a separate 
secure folder on your server, especially if you are dealing with 
extra-sensitive material.<br>
<br>

<h2>CMS Dress for Success!</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 9:02:05 AM&nbsp; Tuesday, August 26, 
2008</p> Content Management Systems, or CMS, are very easy to use. That being 
said, your clients still might have a natural fear of the 
&quot;technology&quot; behind it. Yes, if they know Word and they know how to 
open a web browser, they will be able to update their content (using DMXReady 
applications, anyway -- we can't vouch for other systems!). But sometimes there 
will be a bit of hand-holding on your part to launch the CMS. Here are a few 
ways to make that easier:<br>

<h2>Go Through the CMS With Your Client</h2>Walking your client through the 
CMS is the best way to get them familiar with the system. If you can do it in 
their office, all the better, but usually the CMS is user-friendly enough that 
simply walking through it over the phone will be enough. Make sure too that you 
point out the Help files. Once they've seen how the CMS works and know where 
they can get help, they will be much more comfortable going on their own.<br>

<h2>Create &quot;Editable&quot; Areas</h2>Sometimes giving your client too 
much freedom is a bad thing. You want to make editing or even adding new pages 
as easy as possible. You can do this by making each web page 
&quot;modular&quot; with editable areas. For example, keep images the same size 
and at the same spot so your client simply has to replace it with their new 
image. Text is the same thing -- they can add/remove/change their own text in 
the same spot without disturbing the overall design.<br>
<br>
You can also save 
generic templates that they can copy so that anytime they want to add a new 
page, they have something to work from. This way they have the freedom of 
managing their own content without disturbing the main design.<br>

<h2>Train the Eager Staff First</h2>If your client has more than one person 
who will be using the CMS, go through it with the person who seems most eager 
to learn it. Not only will it be easier for to teach someone who wants to 
learn, but that person will most likely pick it up faster and be the person in 
the office that fields questions from the others -- taking some of this 
responsibility off your own shoulders.<br>

A CMS system is designed to 
make things easier for your client. But you have to remember that things that 
seem &quot;obvious&quot; to you may not be so obvious for a worker who is 
suspicious of technology. Fear, anxiety, even an unwillingness to learn will 
make it difficult sometimes. But once you push through that with your client, 
it will be easier for both of you in the long run.<br>

<h2>Has Your Content Expired?</h2> 
<p>Posted By: The DMXReady Team&nbsp; @ 11:06:01 AM&nbsp; Monday, August 18, 
2008</p> There is an interesting paradox on the Internet. On the one hand, it 
is absolutely the best medium to handle new content or &quot;breaking 
news.&quot; You can have a volcano erupt somewhere in the South Pacific, and 
literally within seconds you can let millions of people around the world know 
about it.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there are websites out there that have 
not changed their content since 1999, with their FrontPage 1.0 flashing text, 
moving flames, and psychedelic backgrounds. It's like a cyber time capsule, 
with little or no relevance to today.<br>
<br>
This is an extreme example, but 
the fact is thatmany website owners do not keep their content as fresh as it 
could be. Yes, you can post something that happened a split-second ago. But 
this usually means getting someone who can upload the images and content. Most 
web owners do not have the capabilities to do that themselves.<br>
<br>
But 
there is a way to empower website owners: Content Management Systems or CMS 
allow anyone with basic web skills to create and update their own content. Some 
systems, like DMXReady applications for example, are easy to install and will 
have the owner up and running in no time. Then all the website owner has to do 
is log in through any standard browser, and type new content, upload images and 
media, even plug in Web 2.0 applications for further functionality.<br>
<br>
If 
you are a web designer, you should consider offering CMS to your clients. Not 
only does it give them the power to update their own content, but it can bring 
in more work for you through customizing and installing the software.<br>
<br>

Take a look at some of our customizable CMS solutions including the newOnline 
Notebook Manager. And make sure that your website doesn't become a time capsule 
as well!<br>
