<h1>PHP and other languages</h1> 
<p> PHP is the best language for web programming, but what about other 
languages?</p> 
<ol> 
<li> PHP vs. ASP? </li> 
<li> PHP vs. ColdFusion? </li> 
<li> PHP vs. Perl? </li> </ol> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. ASP? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> ASP is not really a language in itself, but an acronym for Active Server 
Pages; the actual languages used to program ASP include Visual Basic Script, 
JScript, and C#, among others. The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a 
proprietary system that is natively used only on the Microsoft Internet 
Information Server (IIS) platform. This limits its availability to Win32 based 
servers. There are a couple of projects in the works that allows ASP to 
function with other environments and webservers:&raquo;&nbsp;InstantASP from 
&raquo;&nbsp;Halcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from &raquo;&nbsp;Chili!Soft 
(commercial), and&raquo;&nbsp;Mono (open-source). ASP is said to be a slower 
and more cumbersome language than PHP, with less overall stability. One of the 
pro's of ASP is that, since it primarily uses VBScript, it's relatively easy to 
pick up the language if you're already proficient in Visual Basic. ASP support 
is also enabled by default in IIS, making it easy to get up and running. 
However, the components built in ASP are really limited, so if you need to use 
&quot;advanced&quot; features (like interacting with FTP servers), you'll need 
to buy additional components.</p> </dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. ColdFusion? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex 
programming tasks and trying out new ideas, and is considered by many to be 
more stable and less resource-intensive as well. While ColdFusion once had 
better error handling, database abstraction, and date parsing, the database 
abstraction shortfalls were addressed in PHP 4. A particular quality that is 
listed as one of ColdFusion's strengths is its excellent search engine, but 
many strong arguments suggest that a search engine is not something that should 
be included in a web scripting language. Further, PHP runs on nearly every 
modern platform in existence, while Cold Fusion is only available on Windows, 
Solaris, Linux, MacOS, and AIX. Cold Fusion has a good IDE and is generally 
quicker for new programmers to achieve results for very simple applications, 
whereas PHP initially requires more programming knowledge. Cold Fusion is 
designed with non-programmers in mind, while PHP is focused on programmers.</p> 
</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. Perl? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that PHP was designed for 
scripting for the web, while Perl was designed to do a lot more. Because of 
this, Perl can get very complicated. The flexibility / complexity of Perl can 
make it difficult for developers of varying skill levels to collaborate. PHP 
has a less-confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility. PHP is 
also easier to integrate into existing HTML than Perl. In large part, PHP has 
all the 'good' functionality of Perl - constructs, syntax, et cetera - without 
making it as complicated as Perl can be. Yet PHP's command-line interpreter 
(CLI) is powerful enough to perform high-level tasks much in the same way Perl 
has been traditionally employed. Perl is a very tried and true language, and 
has stood its ground since the 1980's, but PHP has matured and evolved quickly, 
and continues to make fantastic progress.</p> </dd> </dl> <br>

06-Jun-2006 12:58 <code> I think it's worth to mention that it's incredible 
easy to write a PHP module in C and use it in your scripts with the speed of 
true machine language. All the PHP API functions are there and there's plenty 
of examples due to the many existing modules and their source codes.<br>
<br>
 
The advantage here is programming the relative simple business logic in PHP and 
programming those core functions that really require speed in PHP modules, if 
you really have to.<br>
 Compiled Java classes act more like optimised / 
confuscated scripts and still needs an interpreter in the end.<br>
<br>
 The 
only disadvantage about PHP is the somewhat quirky language and inconsistant 
(and long) function names, which makes it hard for newbies to learn from 
scratch. </code> <strong>good dot midget at gmail dot com</strong> 16-Dec-2005 
09:49 <code> I think there's been a slight overlook within the comments about 
PHP's model for OOP.<br>
<br>
 Firstly, I was absolutely thrilled to see the 
enhancements of PHP5.&nbsp; I've been using PHP for... gees...&nbsp; a long 
time now.&nbsp; But what's always been lacking has been fully implemented 
OOP.&nbsp; Now, granted, there are ways to do things like method overloading, 
but c`mon.... really...&nbsp; Now, I know the argument is that PHP is related 
to the web - not application development.&nbsp; I believe that the PHP 
community today suffers from this mentality.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is 
that the world is rapidly shifting towards an SOA mentality, and rich 
applications presented through the web.&nbsp; In light of this PHP should be 
regarded as valuable tool for application development.<br>
<br>
 I would say 
that while PHP has tremendous strength, it equally lacks in its implementation 
of OOP requirements.&nbsp; I find that most suggested &quot;design 
patterns&quot; are weak workarounds in PHP.&nbsp; C# (.NET), Java -- hell even 
ActionScript have a fully OO implementation allowing effective implementation 
of recognized design patterns.&nbsp; Futhermore, due to PHP's lack of OO 
support, true collaborative team development is greatly hindered.&nbsp; This is 
particularly evidenced in the lack of strict type casting.&nbsp; Legit 
development teams rely on this to effectively lock down their interfaces, 
implement error handling, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
 I'm very dissappointed to see 
that languages (like C#), sponsored by the likes of M$ have been able to 
develop such mature OO languages so rapidly, while PHP remains... well... 
practically in the stone age.<br>
<br>
 Once these issues are addressed I think 
we'll see more support of PHP, and less resistance to its place in the 
enterprise.&nbsp; Abstraction is a stupid thing to bicker about.&nbsp; How long 
does it really take to write a good data abstraction layer - that can be 
repurposed.&nbsp; What's more important is the capability of the language.<br>

<br> Hopefully IBM will jump in here and kick things into high gear.&nbsp; 
Let's get rid of all the back support and compatabilities for legacy code in 
favor of maturing the language and increasing its value (and decreasing 
objections from the enterprise market) </code> <strong>daniel at cedilotte dot 
com</strong> 03-Nov-2005 04:58 <code> Another thing related to PHP vs ASP.<br>

<br> In PHP, it's possible to make sure your Include files are not included 
more than once. Where as in ASP/VBScript, you can't due to the fact that SSI is 
processed before the VB code. </code> <strong>ahumeniy at vtr dot net</strong> 
21-May-2005 05:43 <code> I agree with Web Consultant concerning to ASP.net and 
.net framework. It's necessary an update to this article.<br>
<br>
 Currently, 
ASP.net is at the same level than PHP and, i would say that is better because i 
can choose what language to use (PHP is also available for .net by the way).<br>
<br> Thanks to it's common language runtime, .net technology allows the 
programer to choice wich language to use.<br>
<br>
 Also, ASP.net can make 
things that PHP don't such as manipulate the server's filesystem (y use that 
technique in the database system of my own CMS made with .net) and not only the 
files that are inside the website. Also, ASP.net make a lot easier for 
programmers to make programs that communicate with the web site without needing 
of a browser (I use that technique in a small application that allows my site's 
users to &quot;navigate&quot; the site and also send and receive personal 
messages a lot faster than with the web)<br>
<br>
 PHP needs to get improved to 
be better than ASP.net. I hope that the better wins </code> <strong>symcbean
</strong> 20-Feb-2005 10:00 <code> I really must take issue with (Cash at 
nospam dot thesilverside dot com)'s comments regarding enterprise applications 
and PHP.<br>
<br>
 Yes, PHP is an interpreted language (but...PHP Accelerator? 
also you can write caching *with* PHP, also checkout
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/, and have you seen the benchmarks for 
Pharrot?). Adding more tiers into your application is a recipe for disaster 
since it reduces scalability by creating bottlenecks/crossovers and has a big 
impact on transparency. I'll admit that for a very few applications, then 
server hardware is more expensive than developer time - like if you're turning 
around more than 500000 hits/hour, then it may work out cheaper to develop in 
'C' with half the servers than PHP, but this is far from the sort of volume 
I've seen on an enterprise application. There's a lot been written elsewhere on 
PHP and scalability which I won't repeat here.<br>
<br>
 There are issues with 
using PHP for this kind of application. Firstly managment of privilege - but 
that applies (AFAIK) to any web-based system. There's also the problem of 
namespace collisions in large apps.<br>
<br>
 Since I regularly develop 
embedded applications with PHP using HTTP as the communications substrate for 
transactions spanning 6 or more origanisations, I'd like to know whay I 
shouldn't be using PHP / processing synchronously, and how I can create a near 
real-time system without synchronous operation.<br>
<br>
 It'd be a sad world 
to live in where there was only one programming language/methodoly/idiom - 
diversity is a great thing. Java provides beans and struts, Coldfusion provides 
fast development and .NET....(suggestions please). PHP comes closest to solving 
my problems, many of which are very much in the enterprise applications domain. 
</code> <strong>Web Consultant Since 1994</strong> 19-Jan-2005 06:26 <code> 
...Well, all I can say about ASP.NET and the .Net frameworks is that rather 
than adopt them we decided to switch all of our development to PHP and other 
open-source tools. We simply got tired of all the churing of the development 
platform from $soft: things like changing API's during final betas, 
undocumented api's etc.<br>
<br>
 Ive programmed in C, C++, VB, ASP (since the 
original beta in 1995) and ASP.Net, Com, Com+, .Net Frameworks and in 
C(&quot;sharp&quot;). The fact of the matter is that most of these new and 
&quot;improved&quot; development tools dont save much, if any money, and are 
mostly, unnecessary. We have found PHP to be an excellent replacement for 
similar $soft tools and technologies for web development.<br>
<br>
 Its true 
that there is a bit more code required to supplement things that $soft and 
others give you for a price, but the bottom line is that most of these things 
are not very difficult to do properly. In our business there is a huge risk 
from not having access to source code and we simply cant be held hostage by a 
third party company: when you add up the dollar value of this risk for our 
business it far exceeds the few dollars we need to spend in extra supplemental 
coding - which is done once so its a one-time cost. </code> <strong>berjoza at

&quot;c:\usr\local\php\extensions&quot; </code> <strong>Cash at nospam dot 
thesilverside dot com</strong> 11-Jan-2004 06:12 <code> To correctly utilize 
PHP in enterprise applications, one may want to bear in mind that if PHP is 
being used synchronously, it should be kept to the presentation layer only. 
Other languages that were previously mentioned througout the notes above (such 
as Perl, Java, and the .NET CLR... if you're on Windows) would be more 
appropriately used within the business process and data access layers. If you 
really want to maintain higher speed on presentation, then perhaps one would 
want to incorporate asynchronous instead of synchronous processing into the 
presentation layer of your application.<br>
<br>
 In other words, if you are 
using a connected data source, such as a SQL database, try shifting the 
processing time back a layer by providing a medium interval return from the 
data source to an XML file that the web service can access. This will allow 
your web presentation layer to load the data significantly faster than it is 
now. It will also give more resources back to PHP and your web service 
processes.<br>
<br>
 If you still cannot get the PHP processes back up to par, 
then you should consider using PHP as an asynchronous page constructor, thus 
shifting PHP itself back to the business process layer and allowing the web 
service (Apache, IIS, Netscape, etc.) to return HTML files instead.<br>
<br>
 
Aside from page caching, (to my knowledge) you simply cannot get any faster 
than that. </code> <strong>Tricrokra</strong> 26-Oct-2003 01:28 <code> I have 
to note that a very big advantage of PHP over ASP is that PHP has much easier 
commands...<br>
<br>
 Take openening of a file in ASP...<br>
 First create a 
file object... I put this into a function because the line is simpy to long and 
I called it &quot;Init fileobject&quot;<br>
<br>
 &lt;%<br>
 
Initfileobject&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Sub I created in order not to type that 
idot line all the time<br>
 Set Fil = 
FileObject.OpenTextFile(Server.MapPath(&quot;data&quot;)&amp;&quot;\datafile&quot;)
<br> datavar = Fil.ReadLine<br>
 CloseFile Fil<br>
 Set Fil = Nothing<br>
 Set 
FileObject = Nothing<br>
 %&gt;<br>
<br>
 Why always those objects...<br>
<br>
 
The same thing in PHP<br>
<br>
&lt;?php<br>
 $fil = fopen(
&quot;data/datafile&quot;,&quot;r&quot;);<br>
$datavar = fgets($fil);<br>
fclose
($fil);<br>
?&gt;<br>
<br>
 That's all...<br>
<br>
 And that while VBScript is 
based on BASIC (BEGINNERS Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code)...<br>
<br>
 I 
code too shortly in PHP to make a full analysis yet, but the complex object 
structues of VBScript is something I really put in question, PHP has a much 
easier syntax when it comes to that...<br>
<br>
 One of the first things I saw 
was that PHP is based on C, which is one of the hardest programming languages 
in the world. That makes the syntax of for example the &quot;for&quot; 
statement less to my desire, which I like better in VBScript (ASP)... If you 
are an experienced C or C++ programmer, I think PHP makes automaticly the best 
choice out of PHP vs ASP.<br>
<br>
 But I did find out in only 1 hour that the 
syntax of PHP gives you much less typing than ASP, that is a fact. I think that 
for the rest the pick of language is pretty personal.<br>
<br>
 When it comes 
to stability. ASP servers crash very much. I don't think ASP itself is the evil 
one in this. ASP only runs on Windows servers, and we all know how much Windows 
crashes. I truely believe that also picks a part of the puzzle... </code>

 QUOTE:<br>
 This is a comparison between 
PHP and Java/JSP:<br>
<br>
http://www.tek271.com/articles/JavaOrPhp.html<br>

<br> Any comments?<br>
 ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
 Probably 
the worst comparison I have seen in a long while. They penalize PHP for class 
scope and global variables and such.<br>
<br>
 1)&nbsp; While that may be 
relevant for APPLICATION programming, it's totally irrelevant for web 
programming.&nbsp; Web programming, imho, is about being able to get a quick, 
organized solution out QUICKLY so that it can be maintained and dynamic. The 
global variables, lack of package system, and loosely typed nature of PHP makes 
it easier to use and get stuff done in, while the syntax is still clean and 
easy to maintain. On applications programming.. yes.. Java is a better 
solution. But for web programming, JSP doesn't hold a candle to PHP, imo.<br>

<br> 2) With PHP 5, I would just like to remind everyone, there will be a lot 
of concessions to Java programmers (mostly to lure C++ hackers to PHP over C# 
or Java) like constants, abstract stuff, and access control. While it won't 
impact the programming that much ( you can still code just like you always 
have) you can at least feel more like C++ when we finally get to use PHP5.<br>

<br>
 We probably all agree that 
PHP, compared to what ColdFusion was at the time of the writing of that part of 
this FAQ, is far more capable of complex scripts, and also generally 
outperforms ColdFusion in similar tasks, too.<br>
<br>
 I'm not familiar with 
ColdFusion MX, but as it sounds like it's a rather new product, I would draw 
the conclusion that it isn't what the writer of this FAQ had in mind when 
addressing PHP vs. ColdFusion comparisons.<br>

must have made the same conclusion based on his discovery that the FAQ is 
outdated and thus should be updated.<br>

Consultant</strong> 04-Apr-2003 08:39 <code> Sounds like this FAQ needs to be 
updated.<br>
<br>
 How about ASP.NET and .NET Framework?<br>
 How about 
ColdFusion MX?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 PHP has limited/None out-of-the-box database 
integration with popular RDBMS(Oracle,SQL Server), integration with COM and to 
Java Servlet and Enterprise Javabeans, that alone make ColdFusion MX and 
ASP.NET an attractive development platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 PHP might be 
good for developing non complex websites for no cost; however when you are 
developing enterprise web&nbsp; systems that have to integrate with many 
different flavor of sources .. php does not have the out-of-the-box 
functionality for the above needs.<br>
<br>
 &quot;PHP is commonly said to be 
faster and more efficient for complex programming tasks and trying out new 
ideas. PHP is generally referred to as more stable and less resource intensive 
as well. &quot;<br>
<br>
 I like to see proof of this statement. How is a 
interpreted&nbsp; languge faster and less resource intensive than a compiled 
languge(JSP,ASP.NET, and ColdFusion MX)?<br>
<br>
 ColdFusion MX Server cost 
about $1300, but the total built in functionality and versatility makes it a 
worthwhile. If you start out with PHP, ask yourself how much time and money you 
have in developing the source to provide the functionality you are looking for.

 I can tell that for web development

 On the other hand you just can't do anything very special 
with CF like opening a socket with the ease of php.<br>
 I would say : use what 
you need for your application, cfm is truly the fastest, as it has a daemon 
running instead of a per request, plus the ability to cache queries that is 
awesome.<br>
 php is fast but is a pain on some aspects and has loads of bugs.
<br> JSP have almost no bug at all, or at least i did not find any, but it is 
hard to debug.<br>
 Good thing on JSP is that you can write real applications 
and have perfect interaction by using classes, plus it is much more of a 
serious language.The only problem is that you take at least twice times to make

 To ahabra,<br>
<br>
 Very interesting page.&nbsp; I would ask the following, 
however as you investigate this topic further... you'll soon become the PHP vs. 
Java guru.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Your comparisons are interesting and well thought 
out.&nbsp; I would also add some higher-level (less computer-science oriented, 
simply because the task at hand is generating web pages 'on the fly').&nbsp; As 
a pure CS language, there is no doubt that Java is superior.&nbsp; But as a web 
page generator, I have moved from a Java-centric approach to a PHP approach, 
leveraging servlets or beans as needed &quot;under the covers&quot;.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> Therefore, some higher-level things to consider:<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 1) 
Compare the complexity of real-world production applications (postnuke.com vs ? 
in content management, phpbb.com vs. ? in discussion boards, jpgraph vs. ? in 
graphing).&nbsp; In my mind, the proof is in the pudding - which technology 
results in the better, more production-ready applications?&nbsp; They may be 
out there for Java - I would just like to know where they are and who is using 
them.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 2) Compare slinging (generation) of markup which is 
where PHP excels (as it was designed to sling markup - this includes features 
such as character transformations, variable accessibility, web page captures 
(see the fopen call which captures a web page in a single function call).&nbsp; 
Your point about a string being encapsulated in a string class is somewhat 
irrelevant if you are a programmer cranking markup.&nbsp; Embedding 
object-oriented code into a page can be much more painful (and slower to 
execute) than leveraging traditional coding techniques.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 3) 
Compare native database and directory support.&nbsp; Java would have the 
advantage in generic database access (JDBC) but PHP has the advantage in LDAP 
support (JNDI has several bugs which we have run into - quite painful) and 
native database access (e.g., Oracle or MySQL integration).<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
Overall, well done - and a very popular topic!&nbsp; It's worth building it out 
further. </code> <strong>developer at i-space dot org</strong> 04-Mar-2002 03:34
