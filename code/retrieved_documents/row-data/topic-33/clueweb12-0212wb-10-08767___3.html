<p>Among website builders, the words ASP and PHP are very popular. But what 
are they? ASP and PHP are languages that are commonly used in building dynamic 
websites. The website produced by these languages can interact with databases 
and exchange information.</p> 
<p>ASP means Active Server Pages while PHP means Personal Home Pages. ASP can 
be used with Internet Information Server or the IIS while PHP can be used on 
Unix and Linux servers. PHP also has an NT server version. There are several 
identified differences between these two languages. The debate as to which is 
better is still confusing many website builders.</p> 
<p>To better gauge which between these two languages is more convenient to 
use, please see below table of differences.</p> DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASP AND PHP 
<br> <br>
<b>ASP</b> <b>PHP</b> <br>
ASP is from Microsoft thus it runs on 
Microsoft Servers alone. However it can also run on Linux provided there is an 
ASP-Apache installed. PHP is from Rasmus Lerdorf and it runs on Unix and Linux. 
<br> ASP is built on COM based architecture which makes it run slower. PHP runs 
fasters since its codes are from its own memory space. <br>
In terms of cost, 
ASP requires a fee and can be quite expensive. You need to have a budget to run 
ASP. There are products that you need to purchase from Microsoft to make ASP 
work for you. PHP runs on Linux which is free. Even with other variables like 
the connectivity of the database, you can get something for free if you use 
PHP. In terms of cost, PHP is better compared to ASP. Even the codes used in 
PHP can be acquired for free. <br>
In terms of language, ASP uses a Visual 
basic form of Syntax. In terms of language, PHP uses C++ and the syntax is more 
like a C/C++. <br>
In terms of connectivity to database, ASP can only use 
MS-SQL and no other than that. PHP can use different database connectivity. 
Although the most common database used is the MySQL. <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Both ASP and PHP have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. As a 
programming language, they are both useful inbuilding a website. It is still 
the web developers&#146; discretion as to what language to use. One advice 
would be: use the language more comfortable to you! There are several things to 
consider before deciding which language to use. Just be sure that whatever you 
choose, use it effectively to get good outcome.</p>
