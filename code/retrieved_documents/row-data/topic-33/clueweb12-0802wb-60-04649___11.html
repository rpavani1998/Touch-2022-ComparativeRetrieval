project looks interesting. The bid include a life-time guaranty, (I'm pretty 
sure you will not find many of us offering such guaranty). I am a web developer 
with more than five years of experience and lots of tricks in the bag. Your 
website can revitalise your business, or crush it. Don't give that power to the 
lowest bidder. Please contact me for further details and samples of my work. 
Why don't get a Ph.D. into it if you can pay him the same that any newcomer 
would charge you? That's is exactly what i am offering you. The brain power of 
a Ph.D. at the cost of someone that barely can read php. &nbsp;less <br>
