<h1>PHP and other languages</h1> 
<p> </p> 
<p> PHP is the best language for web programming, but what about other 
languages?</p> 
<ol> 
<li> PHP vs. ASP? </li> 
<li> PHP vs. ColdFusion? </li> 
<li> PHP vs. Perl? </li> </ol> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. ASP? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> ASP is not really a language in itself, but an acronym for Active Server 
Pages; the actual languages used to program ASP include Visual Basic Script, 
JScript, and C#, among others. The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a 
proprietary system that is natively used only on the Microsoft Internet 
Information Server (IIS) platform. This limits its availability to Win32 based 
servers. There are a couple of projects in the works that allows ASP to 
function with other environments and webservers:&raquo; InstantASP from &raquo; 
Halcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from &raquo; Chili!Soft (commercial), and 
&raquo; Mono (open-source). ASP is said to be a slower and more cumbersome 
language than PHP, with less overall stability. One of the pro's of ASP is 
that, since it primarily uses VBScript, it's relatively easy to pick up the 
language if you're already proficient in Visual Basic. ASP support is also 
enabled by default in IIS, making it easy to get up and running. However, the 
components built in ASP are really limited, so if you need to use 
&quot;advanced&quot; features (like interacting with FTP servers), you'll need 
to buy additional components.</p> </dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. ColdFusion? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex 
programming tasks and trying out new ideas, and is considered by many to be 
more stable and less resource-intensive as well. While ColdFusion once had 
better error handling, database abstraction, and date parsing, the database 
abstraction shortfalls were addressed in PHP 4. A particular quality that is 
listed as one of ColdFusion's strengths is its excellent search engine, but 
many strong arguments suggest that a search engine is not something that should 
be included in a web scripting language. Further, PHP runs on nearly every 
modern platform in existence, while Cold Fusion is only available on Windows, 
Solaris, Linux, MacOS, and AIX. Cold Fusion has a good IDE and is generally 
quicker for new programmers to achieve results for very simple applications, 
whereas PHP initially requires more programming knowledge. Cold Fusion is 
designed with non-programmers in mind, while PHP is focused on programmers.</p> 
</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> <strong> PHP vs. Perl? </strong> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that PHP was designed for 
scripting for the web, while Perl was designed to do a lot more. Because of 
this, Perl can get very complicated. The flexibility / complexity of Perl can 
make it difficult for developers of varying skill levels to collaborate. PHP 
has a less-confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility. PHP is 
also easier to integrate into existing HTML than Perl. In large part, PHP has 
all the 'good' functionality of Perl - constructs, syntax, et cetera - without 
making it as complicated as Perl can be. Yet PHP's command-line interpreter 
(CLI) is powerful enough to perform high-level tasks much in the same way Perl 
has been traditionally employed. Perl is a very tried and true language, and 
has stood its ground since the 1980's, but PHP has matured and evolved quickly, 
and continues to make fantastic progress.</p> </dd> </dl> PHP and COM <br>
