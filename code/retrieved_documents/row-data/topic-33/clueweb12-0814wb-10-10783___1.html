PM  Newbie question... I have a web server and use iisprotect for part of it 
which is an asp application. Starting to redesign the website itself, and I 
like your template.<br>
<br>
 Is it problematic to run both asp and php on an 
Win23K, iis6 server?<br>
<br>
 If not too difficult, can you direct me to 
reference on that (if too basic, I will just google it)?  Powered by
