What Is <b><i>Adobe/Macromedia Flex</i></b>?
<p> As a web developer you've often found yourself wishing there was a way to 
make web applications that weren't limited to the heavy restrictions of HTML. 
You've used JavaScript to make your forms a little more intuitive with 
dynamic/context driven comboboxes, but to do anything more often requires heavy 
amounts of JavaScript and DHTML. Even if you are a pro at it, it's extremely 
time consuming to make workflow interactive and user friendly. More 
importantly, why would you want to be spending so much time on core UI 
functionality when you're getting paid to work on business logic and workflow.
</p>
<p> <b>Adobe/Macromedia Flex</b> takes you to the next level of web 
application development with the concept of<b>Rich Internet Applications</b> 
(aka RIAs). You may have seen applications developed natively in Flash itself 
and realized that it offers a much more robust experience for the user where 
productivity is bolstered by ease of use, streamlined workflow, and real time 
interactivity that is impossible to accomplish in HTML itself. However 
developing rich applications in Flash for those who are core developers is 
daunting and unintuitive. The Flash development tool is geared for designers, 
and developing on a timeline is a strange concept. Flex removes that barrier to 
entry by providing a programmatic way for developing these RIAs.</p>
<p> Rich Internet Applications</p>
<p> What is an RIA anyways? Well HTML applications are state-less. Application 
servers maintain state by using cookies and session variables to keep track of 
users, but all the logic is on the server. So while a user is looking at a page 
in their browser, the application is unable to do anything until the user 
commits an action that sends data from the page back to the server for 
processing. The code processes the data, and generates resulting HTML that the 
browser loads back in.</p>
<p> A simple example would be a report or search tool that queries a sales/CRM 
database based on various criteria from the user such as deal time frame, 
product group, and sales executive. The user enters these values, clicks on a 
submit button, and the browser goes blank while it waits for a response from 
the server and loads the resulting HTML which would be a tabular list of 
records that match the criteria:</p>
<p> Time Frame From  To  Product Group All Adapters Routers Hubs Switches  
Sales Exec All Jeff Smith Bob Gordon John Sykes </p> Deal Initiated Product 
Group Product Sales Exec Value ($) <br>
04/03/2005 Adapters ADPR2D2 Jeff Smith 
100K <br>
04/10/2005 Switches SWC3PO Bob Gordon 142K <br>
<br>

<p> Look familiar to anything you've done? Now if the user wants to change the 
parameters, or perhaps sort on a particular column, typically the page would 
need to be sent back to the server where it rebuilds an up to date report based 
on the new criteria. Pretty standard stuff for Coldfusion, JSP, PHP, ASP, or 
any other servlet language.</p>
<p> In the Flex world, your application wouldn't need to post a request to the 
server every time the user made a change. Instead of the logic living purely on 
the server side, your presentation tier is all on the client. So imagine 
changing filters or criteria, and the table automatically updating as a result. 
Imagine clicking on a column title and the column automatically sorts without 
reloading the page. This saves hits to your web server, application server, 
database, and network. For one user this may not be a big deal, but what about 
1000 users, or 10 000 users?</p>
<p> HTML based applications are a series of HTML web pages; Flex applications 
are LIVE applications. A simple analogy is imagine Word or Excel being an HTML 
web application; vs the real application itself. It could be done; but the real 
application is aware of your mouse movements, every key stroke, and provides 
much more feedback to the user by using sound, animation, and other visual 
queues.</p>
<p> Even better, with the Flash Player penetration near 99% (version 7 is at 
83%) you can provide this real-time rich experience on Unix, Windows, and MAC. 
Alternatively any richness you try to accomplish in IE using DCOM, ActiveX, and 
DHTML locks you down to particular platforms.</p>
<p> Flex vs Coldfusion (and other servlets) </p>
<p> For CFMX developers, Flex doesn't replace CF (or JSP/J2EE/PHP/ASP/etc...). 
It's a companion to your existing technology by being at the presentation tier, 
while your other Application servers provide the middle/business tier. It lets 
you focus on the client workflow, and not waste time building HTML tables and 
endless cosmetic logic.</p>
<p> I put together a simple example that demonstrates this, which you can 
download here. The attached file provides a static XML file; but you easily 
hook it up to a CF template which queries a database based on the parameters 
passed in via the URL and return back the up to date HTML.</p>
<p> The first example which uses Coldfusion:<br>
</p>
<p> It does a CFHTTP to the XML provider by passing in the sort direction 
parameters based on what column a user clicked on. After parsing the XML, it 
loops through the XML array with some basic styling to do alternating row 
colors. It's roughly 40 lines or so, depending on how compact or readable you 
want to make your code.</p>
<p> The second example which uses Flex:<br>
</p>
<p> Since my web hosting company doesn't provide Flex hosting I can only 
provide screen captures. The Flex version retrieves the exact same XML content 
as the Coldfusion one would. However the key notes to make in the above example 
are:</p>
<li> The Flex version is <b>2</b> lines of code. </li>
<li> The Flex version's columns are sortable AND re-sizeable with no page 
refreshing required.</li>
<li> No time is wasted building basic UI elements (that is tables). 
<p> Another common scenario we're all used to is list &amp; edit. As 
demonstrated above, often you'll use a table to list data, and then present the 
user with an edit icon which let's you edit that record, which posts a URL to 
the server, where the browser loads in an edit page where you make the 
appropriate changes, then hit submit, the server processes the update and then 
sends back the resulting HTML. That's a mouthful! Why not edit right in the 
table itself; much like you would with Excel?</p>
<p> The folks at iteration:two in their Flex Blog demonstrate this capability. 
Click on any row and you'll see how it's immediately editable. Since the 
application is live you don't need that common update/submit button to post 
that change; the application knows an update was made and can commit those 
changes on the backend if nescessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The hidden beauty is that your Flex app can tap into your Coldfusion CFC's 
as a WebService or RemoteObject with no extra work required. So use Coldfusion 
to work with backend systems like databases, and provide services to the 
presentation tier. And use Flex to handle interacting with the client.</p>
<p> Flex VS AJAX </p>
<p> The mindset you need to employ is that Flex is used for Rich Internet 
Applications, not Rich Web Applications. There isn't a clear line between RIAs 
and RWAs, but Flex is definitely on the RIA side of things in that you are 
building applications that are desktop like but use the internet for deployment 
ease and connectivity to services. Unlike AJAX, which is more along the RWA end 
of the spectrum in that it increases functionality and usage efficiency of web 
pages.</p>
<p> The roots of HTML originate as platform agnostic document distribution, 
and it vastly improved how content can be deployed, but severely compromised on 
UI functionality since it's a stateless mechanism. A web application is 
essentially a choose your own adventure book, where the choices you make 
generate new pages in your book on the fly. Although there is overlap in how 
Flex or AJAX could be used to solve a problem, there is also quite a bit of 
difference.</p>
<p> Think of it like this. If you were to build a photo editor, what would you 
choose? HTML is optimized for document distribution, so although it could be 
done in AJAX using an army of developers - it's clearly the wrong choice. Flex 
on the other hand has desktop like powers, so making such a graphically 
oriented application is fairly straight forward. Or what if you wanted to make 
an application that allows users to update their profile by clicking on a 
button that takes a picture from their webcam - this is extremely easy in Flex, 
and impossible in HTML/AJAX. Or a stock application; in AJAX you would 
continuously poll for updates in the stock symbols the user is interested in 
(even if there is no change in price), compared to the Flex approach where the 
client would use messaging to subscribe to the applicable symbols, and the Flex 
Enterprise Server would push updates as they occur.</p>
<p> AJAX's other drawback is that because Javascript differs from browser to 
browser and OS to OS, a massive amount of QA needs to be done to ensure that it 
works across all platforms. But to be fair there is a major effort to provide 
tools and APIs to abstract that complexity, and streamline the development of 
AJAX based applications. Most notably theOpen AJAX Initiative which is 
supported by such heavyweights as IBM, BEA, Borland, Google, Mozilla, Oracle, 
RedHat, and Yahoo.</p>
<p> So to boil it down Flex and AJAX are like apples and oranges, but they're 
both fruit so they share some characteristics.</p>
<p> Developing in <b>Adobe/Macromedia Flex</b> </p>
<p> So that's all well and dandy, but how long does it take to learn all this 
stuff? Flex uses a combination of a tagged based language called MXML, and an 
object oriented language called Actionscript 2.0 (the language of Flash). For 
Coldfusion and JSP developers the MXML part is immediately understandable. The 
Actionscript part will be familiar to Java, and other OO developers.</p>
<p> You build your main files in .mxml, and can build custom components and 
objects in .as (ActionScript). The Flex Application Server (a J2EE application) 
will compile your code into a Flash file (.swf) which the browser then loads. 
The Flex App server provides other services such as being a gateway to 
RemoteObjects (eg CF CFCs) and WebServices.</p>
<p> Although you can use any text editor to develop, FlexBuilder is the 
primary development tool - which is a customized version of DreamWeaverMX. On 
the debugging front you can use certain components such as XMLObject which 
comes with Flex, flash debugging, and the NetConnection Debugger which lets you 
analyze data between RemoteObjects and the Flash Player (ie your 
Adobe/Macromedia Flex Application).</p>
<p> Flex isn't billed as RAD (Rapid Application Development); it's geared 
towards Enterprise Applications where the real-time interactivity and rich 
workflow are the primary ROI. However developing in Flex is by far faster than 
developing productivity tools in Flash natively; on some accounts there are 
development speed gains of 10X.</p>
<p> Flex out of the box comes with various pieces such as navigators (tree, 
accordian, tab), charting/graphing components, components such as the infamous 
datagrid, and effects such as fades and wipes. They're easy to use and often 
require just passing it data and it handles the presentation on its own. All of 
these can be customized to suit your purposes.</p>
<p> The sky is really the limit when it comes to RIAs. Imagine dragging and 
dropping an item for sale into a shopping cart instead of clicking on the old 
school [add to cart] button. This type of functionality is easy to implement. 
Or the whole realm of sound; where you can provide audio guided applications 
that talk users through their first time in the workflow.</p>
<p> Also consider the case of something like a dashboard such as a Network 
Monitoring Application, or Stock monitor. In the HTML scenario, if the data 
refreshes frequently, you would probably be meta-refreshing that page 
constantly, and again pounding databases for up to the date data. In the Flex 
scenario, since you can create stateful applications, the clients only need to 
load an initial set of data once - and the middle tier can just<b>push/broadcast
</b> deltas or updates (Flash Communication Server comes in handy in this case).
</p>
<p> One of the best examples out there is provided by Macromedia (now known as 
Adobe), called the Flex Store. Try dragging and dropping an article into the 
basket. Or play with the price range slider; the workflow benefits are 
immediately recognizeable. Two other interesting examples include theRestaurant 
Finder from Chrisophe Coenraets where you slide a box around a map to see 
restaurants in the area, and the other being theBrocade Sales Dashboard (click 
on measure viewer, and then a company on the bar graph). For more examples see 
the<b><i>Community Adobe/Macromedia Flex</i></b> home page. </p>
<p> Limitations </p>
<p> Flex applications are Flash applications, and are limited by what the 
Flash player can do.</p></li>
<li> The Flash Player is not a web browser. So producing rich documentation is 
challenging. That is what HTML was specifically designed for.
<p> </p></li>
<li> Flash/Flex popup windows are limited to being displayed within the 
dimensions of the instance of the player that created it. So unlike a popup 
window in a browser which you can move to anywhere on your desktop, your 
Flex/Flash popup windows can't move outside the area occupied by the player. 
This is actually quite a severe limitation if you want to maximize on desktop 
real-estate (especially for users that have multiple monitors). There are 
workarounds in that you can use Flex's Javascript to Actionscript API to popup 
new instances of the player in browser windows, and use Javascript to act as a 
communication bridge - however the effort is rarely justified. The removal of 
this limitation is dependent on theApollo Player (aka the Universal Client) - 
which will allow Flex/Flash apps to run and behave completely like a desktop 
application without having to live inside a browser.
<p> </p></li>
<li> Drag and Drop from Desktop to Player is not supported. This may become 
possible with Apollo, but for now the goal of the Flash player is to remain as 
lightweight as possible and platform agnostic. Being able to drag a file from 
your desktop on the player (to say initiate an upload) would require OS 
specific support.
<p> </p></li>
<li> The Flash SWF format is a published specification - so it is possible for 
other vendors to make tools that generate Flash files. However the future of 
the Flash platform is controlled by a single organization (Adobe/Macromedia), 
unlike open or collaborative intitiatives. But to mitigate that Adobe has been 
extremely open in allowing the community to direct the future of the platform 
(Flex 2 is the result of public alpha and beta programs).
<p> </p></li>
<li> Because Flex applications are thin clients, and not web pages they're not 
suitable for where you want to use a web page. I.e, there is an initial load 
and intialization that occurs when running a flex application initially, so the 
user could have to wait 5-10 seconds as the application gets set up, and once 
its loaded you're rocking and rolling. Similar is the case with desktop 
applications.
