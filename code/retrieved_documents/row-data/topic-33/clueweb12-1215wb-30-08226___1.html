<h1>Chapter 33. PHP and other languages</h1> 
<p> PHP is the best language for web programing, but what about other 
languages?</p>

<dt> 1. PHP vs. ASP? </dt> 
<dt> 2. Is there an ASP to PHP converter? </dt> 
<dt> 3. PHP vs. Cold Fusion? </dt> 
<dt> 4. PHP vs. Perl? </dt> </dl> 
<p><b><b>1.</b> PHP vs. ASP?</b></p> 
<p>ASP is not really a language in itself, it's an acronym for Active Server 
Pages, the actual language used to program ASP with is Visual Basic Script or 
JScript. The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a proprietary system that is 
natively used only on Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). This limits 
it's availability to Win32 based servers. There are a couple of projects in the 
works that allows ASP to run in other environments and webservers:InstantASP 
fromHalcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from Chili!Soft (commercial) and 
OpenASP from ActiveScripting.org (free). ASP is said to be a slower and more 
cumbersome language than PHP, less stable as well. Some of the pros of ASP is 
that since it primarily uses VBScript it's relatively easy to pick up the 
language if you're already know how to program in Visual Basic. ASP support is 
also enabled by default in the IIS server making it easy to get up and running. 
The components built in ASP are really limited, so if you need to use 
&quot;advanced&quot; features like interacting with FTP servers, you need to 
buy additional components.</p> 
<p><b><b>2.</b> Is there an ASP to PHP converter?</b></p> 
<p>Yes, asp2php is the one most often referred to.</p> 
<p><b><b>3.</b> PHP vs. Cold Fusion?</b></p> 
<p>PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex 
programming tasks and trying out new ideas. PHP is generally referred to as 
more stable and less resource intensive as well. Cold Fusion has better error 
handling, database abstraction and date parsing although database abstraction 
is addressed in PHP 4. Another thing that is listed as one of Cold Fusion's 
strengths is its excellent search engine, but it has been mentioned that a 
search engine is not something that should be included in a web scripting 
language. PHP runs on almost every platform there is; Cold Fusion is only 
available on Win32, Solaris, Linux and HP/UX. Cold Fusion has a good IDE and is 
generally easier to get started with, whereas PHP initially requires more 
programming knowledge. Cold Fusion is designed with non-programmers in mind, 
while PHP is focused on programmers.</p> 
<p> A great summary by Michael J Sheldon on this topic has been posted to the 
PHP mailing list. A copy can be found here.</p> 
<p><b><b>4.</b> PHP vs. Perl?</b></p> 
<p>The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that PHP was designed for 
scripting for the web where Perl was designed to do a lot more and can because 
of this get very complicated. The flexibility / complexity of Perl makes it 
easier to write code that another author / coder has a hard time reading. PHP 
has a less confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility. PHP is 
easier to integrate into existing HTML than Perl. PHP has pretty much all the 
'good' functionality of Perl: constructs, syntax and so on, without making it 
as complicated as Perl can be. Perl is a very tried and true language, it's 
been around since the late eighties, but PHP is maturing very quickly.</p> Prev
