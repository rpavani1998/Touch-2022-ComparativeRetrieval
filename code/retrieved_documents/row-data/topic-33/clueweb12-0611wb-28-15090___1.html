Submissions ] <br>

<p>Here are some of the improvements that have been frequently requested for 
HomeSite's ASP, ASP.Net and PHP support. To submit your own ideas,email me if 
you like, though the best way to be heard by Macromedia is to start an ASP 
thread in theHomeSite support forum &nbsp;<strong>-AND-</strong>&nbsp; to 
submit a note via theMacromedia Software Feature Request and Bug Report Form. 
These messages go directly to the development teams.</p> 
<h4>Short List of High-Priority Feature Requests for HomeSite</h4> 
<p><strong>Please remember</strong>, for this discussion of things we'd like 
Macromedia to do, we need to<strong>prioritize</strong>. They have limited 
developer resources to assign right now. Please keep minor things that users 
can do (VTML, scripts, etc) somewhat separate.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>&quot;I realize that there are always lots of improvements that we 
could make to HomeSite to make your life easier, but realistically we can only 
focus on a certain number of features.</em></p> 
<p><em>You can be incredibly helpful on two fronts. First of all, if you can 
<strong>identify a short list of features that would be the highest priority 
fixes for H.S 5.0.</strong> I realize that your wishlist identifies many 
issues, but I am interested in your personal feeling on perhaps a dozen or so 
features. As you know, many of these issues can be resolved through HomeSite 
extensions such as VTML. I will get back to you with my/our feelings on these 
issues. We will try and work-in those features that are the easiest for us to 
put together and that blend into the architecture of HomeSite.&quot;</em> --Dan 
Noel</p> </blockquote> 
<p>From my reading of forum posts and email, I'd guess that these are the 
major requests in this area. Please comment, expand, disagree or suggest 
additions.</p> 
<ol> 
<p></p> 
<li><strong>Code-Sense/Intelli-sense Feature</strong><br>
 This seems to be 
the most requested feature from Interdev. This is similar to the HTML tag 
insight, but covers functions and objects in ASP. Also requested to cover 
Javascript and Javascript DOM. (thread) 
<blockquote> Patrik Muzila of allaire has said on this: &quot; <em><strong>
Object Insight</strong> - Many of you requested an ASP aware code insight 
feature. This is not a simple feature as object instance recognition was to be 
implemented. At the present Homesite does little interpretation of its document 
contents especially when script is involved. We are dealing with the same issue 
with JRUN Studio. The new feature is going to take some time to develop (5.0 
timeframe), but once completed, it should not be difficult to apply it to ASP.
</em>&quot; </blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Database interfacing features</strong><br>
 This is discussed a 
bit inthis thread and it seems that CF Studio already has some functionality in 
this area. Perhaps it could be extended to help with ASP DB use in HomeSite. We 
could use more details of what functionality would be useful though.
<blockquote> <em>&quot;Well the only (ADO) tool I'd find of use is a DSNless 
connection string that could be built browsing to the object in question, 
determine the type of ODBC connection, and fill in the required parameters. 
Other then that, a reference would be enough. Though intellisense for filling 
in any vbs/ado constants would be very very helpful too. Actually one other 
tool that would be nice would be a<strong>test pad</strong> for checking to see 
if an ADO connection works correctly and view the results, sort of like some 
tools available for building a query and testing the results.&quot;</em> -- 
Scott St. Jean</blockquote> 
<blockquote> <em>SQL Server support: I would like to be able to right click a 
line such as this:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set objRS = objConn.Execute(&quot;sql 
statement&quot;)<br>
 and to be able to see the resultant recordset in a table 
view. I would also like to have the option of validating the statement.</em> -- 
John Carpenter</blockquote> 
<blockquote> <em>If &quot;sql statement&quot; is the name of a stored 
procedure I would like to be able to edit it, grant permissions to it and so 
on. If the stored procedure does not yet exist, I would like to be given the 
option to create it. This could probably be done by integrating HS and MS SQL 
Server Query Analyser.</em> -- John Carpenter </blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Fix the tag selection/editing when within ASP tags</strong><br>
 
HS V4.5x broke what previously worked. That is, you could call up Edit Tag on 
an HTML tag within ASP &lt;% %&gt; tags. Example) In this code, put your curser 
in the table tag and try to call up edit tag:<br>

<blockquote> &lt;% response.write &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; %&gt; </blockquote>
<p>Of course, this will have other issues if you don't also fix the use of 
single quotes issue. If the editor replaces single quotes or escaped double 
quotes with a single set of double quotes on attributes, it may break the code.
</p> 
<blockquote> Looks like this is fixed for some cases in HSv5. It calls up the 
tag editors just fine. Have to test with single-quotes yet... Some users are 
reporting code cases where it is still broken though. (thread) ~jw 11/26/01 
</blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Improved ASP Color Coding</strong><br>
 This was frequently 
requested, but seems to have been addressed pretty satisfactorily in HS 4.5.1 
and later.
<blockquote> <em><strong>This is still an issue for ASP.Net.</strong> Parser 
support for various ASP.Net languages is one of the most requested ASP.Net 
enhancements. You can find a few parsers atASPdotNet4Hs.</em> </blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Single point option to force HomeSite to use single-quote chars 
for HTML tag attributes</strong><br>
 In ASP and PHP coding, where code is 
generating HTML tags, it's often easier to use single quote chars (') rather 
than double quote chars (&quot;). For instance, the code:<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>response.write &quot;&lt;font 
size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;this is a string&lt;/font&gt;&quot;</strong><br>
 will 
not work as intended since the response.write sees the end of the string at the 
&quot; just before the -1. Many developers prefer to use single quotes as so:
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>response.write &quot;&lt;font 
size='-1'&gt;this is a string&lt;/font&gt;&quot;</strong><br>
 rather than 
extra escaped double quotes<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>
response.write &quot;&lt;font size=&quot;&quot;-1&quot;&quot;&gt;this is a 
string&lt;/font&gt;&quot;</strong><br>
 which are easy to miscount. 
<p>A user can go through tag editor files and try to fix this throughout or 
can enter all tags by hand, but that has problems (especially when you work in 
both HTML-only and ASP/PHP pages. A single point option to use single quotes 
would be a big help.</p>
<p>FYI, the particular VTML line to look for in your Extensions\TagDefs\*.vtm 
files is:<br>
<strong>&lt;CONTROL TYPE=&quot;CheckBox&quot; 
NAME=&quot;checkSingleQuotes&quot; ANCHOR=&quot;checkQuotes&quot; ... 
CAPTION=&quot;Single quotes on attributes&quot;/&gt;</strong><br>
 You would 
add a CHECKED attribute to that line.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using the AddRespWrite2 script to convert HTML code 
to response.write's will correctly convert the quotes.</p>
<p>Here is Marjolein's one reply to me on this on 4/18/00:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> <em>No, there is no overall option; however all (VTML versions 
of) HTML Tag Editors have this as an option (off by default). You could do an 
Extended S&amp;R to turn it on by default for all of them (just add a CHECKED 
attribute to the checkbox). Not all built-in editors have this option though.
</em> 
<p><em>I've found that some browsers have (sometimes?) trouble with single 
quotes though, but I cannot remember exact details.</em> </p> 
<p><em>Is there a reason why one would want to have it set for all attributes 
instead of for a single (occasional) tag? If so, I can propose adding that to 
the Settings instead of having it on the Tag Editors only.</em> </p> 
<p><em>Having an option for &quot;quote all attributes&quot; (or not!) in the 
settings is currently being discussed, but there are a lot of issues involved 
to implement this consistently across all tools and still prevent illegal code 
being generated... We're analyzing this (if it does get implemented you won't 
see it before 5.0).</em> </p> 
<p><em>Cheers,<br>
Marjolein Katsma</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Better handling of server side includes.</strong><br>

<blockquote> <em>I want to right click an include and select &quot;Edit&quot;. 
Or I would like to be able to &quot;expand&quot; the include similar to the new 
collapsing text feature. (IE so an include is essentially a collapsed bit of 
text). If ASP Validation is going to be included, HomeSite will need to 
recognise includes properly.</em> -- John Carpenter </blockquote> 
<p>See also the useful functionality of the IncludeBrowse3 and EditLinkedFile 
scripts. See if EditLinkedFile2 can be enhanced to support file includes. See 
if Macromedia can build-in this functionality.-- jw</p> 
<blockquote> HSv5 introduces &quot;<strong>Edit Include File</strong>&quot; on 
the right mouse button. This basically reproduces some of the functionality of 
theEditLinkedFile script in letting you easily click and open a linked include 
file (only file includes, not virtual). See also the article:Editing Referenced 
Files in HomeSite and ColdFusion Studio. 
<p>It supports at least the following:<br>
 &lt;!--#include&gt; 
&lt;cfinclude&gt; &lt;cfmodule&gt; &lt;jsp:include&gt; &lt;%@ include&gt; 
&lt;jsp:forward&gt; &lt;VTINCLUDE&gt; &lt;WIZINCLUDE&gt; &lt;SCRIPT&gt;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>ASP Validation</strong><br>
 Probably not easy, but it would 
probably be a killer feature for ASP coders. I'm not sure if InterDev has it or 
not? Might look for third party validators that could be interfaced to HS.
<blockquote> <em>&quot;Validation of some code, even if we're just talking 
conditional statements and loops, it would help.&quot;</em> -- Scott St. Jean 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> <em>Have had some discussions with Zack Jones of adding ASP 
validation features toASP-Beautify's next version. Discussed possible 
integration with HS in the same way as CSE Validator.</em> -- jw </blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Script Debugging</strong><br>
 This might be possible with good 
integration with the MS Script Debugger. (detail discussion) 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Version Control Improvements</strong><br>
Version/Source Control 
seems to be a bit buggy at the moment.
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Built in language search/reference for vbscript, jscript, ADO and 
perlscript.</strong> 
<blockquote> <em>&quot;Some user made modifications exist, but they aren't as 
good as the integrated support.&quot;</em> -- Scott St. Jean... (I'll discuss 
what the shortcomings are with him and work to improve what's available. Could 
include getting ASP help working with Tag help? -jw)</blockquote> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Integrate the String Conversion to Response.Write's</strong><br>
 
Integrate the functionality inAddRespWrite2 to convert strings to code output 
statements (in various languages). Lower priority as it's available as a script 
now.
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>ASP.Net support</strong><br>
 See section below for specifics. 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>ASP, PHP &amp; ASP.Net documentation support</strong><br>
 The 
documentation that comes installed with HomeSite should have some information 
about using HS with ASP, PHP and ASP.Net, including the fact that you need to 
set up a server to process the pages and that you should use server mapping. (
FAQ) There is very little if any mention of PHP, ASP or ASP.Net in the current 
documentation. Each should have a page. This is not critical for users who have 
already figured these things out, but it would be useful to help new HS users. 
It could link to asp4hs or php4hs if desired to connect them to the available 
resources.</li> </ol> 
<h4>ASP.Net-specific Requests</h4> 
<p>This is an upcoming thing since ASP.Net is still in beta testing itself. See
this thread for some ASP.Net request details. Parsers and custom dialogs would 
probably be most helpful. Users can write many of these things using the 
existing extension capabilities of HomeSite but that shouldn't release 
Macromedia from the responsibility for doing so. SeeASPdotNet4Hs for currently 
available add-ons.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Syntax coloring parsers for ASP.Net languages</strong>, generally 
in combination with HTML</li> 
<li><strong>Custom dialogs for ASP.Net code generation</strong> </li> 
<li>Help / document sets </li> 
<li>Useful scripts </li> 
<li>Useful snippets </li> </ol> 
<h4>PHP-specific Requests</h4> 
<p>See PHP4Hs for currently available add-ons.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> <strong>Improved and Updated PHP Color Coding</strong> <br>
 This was 
frequently requested, and was addressed in HS v5. The PHP3 was updated and a 
new PHP4 parser was added.
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Add DBG PHP Debugging support to Homesite</strong><br>
DBG seems 
to be an open source PHP debugger. It might be possible to integrate it with HS 
to improve PHP development. Requested by a number of people inthis thread. 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Single point option to force HomeSite to use single-quote chars 
for HTML tag attributes</strong><br>
 Mentioned above for ASP. Also applies to 
PHP.</li> </ol> 
<h4>Top InterDev-Feature Requests for HomeSite</h4> 
<blockquote> <em>&quot;On the second front, we do not have a great deal of 
time to develop pages outside of HomeSite. Most of our time is actually spent 
in the Delphi development environment. Therefore, we are most<strong>interested 
in identifying the killer features of InterDev which we could support in 
HomeSite.</strong> Your guidance on these issues would be most helpful. We are 
most interested in those features that contribute greatly to developer 
productivity in ASP, but also other parts of web development.&quot;</em> -Dan 
Noel</blockquote> 
<p>Since I (jeff) use HomeSite exclusively for ASP, and haven't tried the last 
couple of InterDev versions, I'll need feedback from others on this one... Some 
of these are obviously also mentioned in the first list above.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Code-Sense/Intelli-sense/Code Completion Feature </li> 
<li>Script Debugging </li> 
<li>Database interfacing features 
<blockquote> <em>&quot;The features from Interdev that I cannot live without 
are Intellisense (greatest development tool ever!) and the database 
environment. The ability to<strong>manage a SQL Server</strong> without being 
at the server is a Godsend especially since there is no real interface like 
access is/has.<br>
<br>
 These may not be very easy to develop but don't 
necessarily have to be ASP dependant. The<strong>ability to access objects and 
their properties</strong> could be developed for any language that supports the 
creation of objects. The database integration is a must these days in web 
development and should not be excluded for any reason.&quot;</em> -- Clinton 
Gallagher inthis thread. </blockquote> </li> </ol>
