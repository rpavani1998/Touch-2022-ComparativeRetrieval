<p> When building web sites, ASP and PHP are very popular languages. Here's my 
opinion on whether ASP or PHP is best.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>Both ASP and PHP are languages used to build Dynamic Web sites that can 
interact with Databases and exchange information. ASP (Active Server Pages) is 
from Microsoft and is used with IIS (Internet Information Server) that runs on 
Microsoft Servers. PHP (Personal Home Pages) is from Rasmus Lerdorf, who 
originally designed this parsing language which was later modified by different 
people. It runs on Unix and Linux servers and it also has an NT server version.
<p></p> 
<p></p>There are a lot of differences between ASP and PHP. 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Cost</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>To run ASP programs one needs IIS installed on a Windows platform 
server, which is not free. PHP programs run on Linux, which is free. Even the 
connectivity of the database is expensive in the case of ASP as MS-SQL is a 
product of Microsoft that needs to be purchased. PHP generally uses MySQL, 
which is freely available.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Speed</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>If we compare the speed of ASP and PHP then PHP has an upper hand. PHP 
code runs faster than ASP. ASP is built on COM based architecture, which is an 
overhead for the server whereas PHP code runs in its own memory space.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Platform Compatibility</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>PHP programs can run on various platforms like Linux, Unix, Windows and 
Solaris whereas ASP is mainly associated with Windows platforms. However, ASP 
can run on a Linux platform with ASP-Apache installed on the server.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Additional Costs </b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>Many of the tools used in PHP are free of cost and since PHP is open 
source a lot of code can be found in open source forums. PHP has inbuilt 
features like ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms but in 
ASP such features are not built in and some additional components are required. 
Therefore an additional cost is incurred for such components.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Base Language </b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>PHP is based on C++ language and the syntax used in PHP is quite 
similar to C/C++. C/C++ is still considered the best programming language by 
many programmers and people who love this language would surely feel more 
comfortable with the syntax of PHP. ASP on the other hand has a more Visual 
Basic kind of syntax that again is closely related to only Microsoft products. 
So, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Database Connectivity</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>PHP, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the 
most popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Conclusion</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>Both languages have their advantages specific to users. Some would 
argue that both the languages have their own importance and depending on the 
user's requirements the language and the platform can be chosen. If we talk 
about developing a discussion board then ASP is equally capable but many feel 
the best discussion boards are developed in PHP. If a user is looking for some 
e-commerce application development then many would call ASP the ideal choice. 
This does not mean that PHP cannot provide e-commerce solutions, only that many 
people choose ASP.
<p></p> 
<p></p>From my perspective, PHP is an all around better choice than ASP.
