Enhancement Requests - <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Here are some of the improvements that have been frequently requested for 
HomeSite's ASP, ASP.Net and PHP support. To submit your own ideas,email me if 
you like, though the best way to be heard by Macromedia is to start an ASP 
thread in theHomeSite support forum &nbsp;<strong>-AND-</strong>&nbsp; to 
submit a note via theMacromedia Software Feature Request and Bug Report Form. 
These messages go directly to the development teams. ... better yet, fulfill 
some of these yourself and send me the info.</p> 
<ul> 
<p></p> 
<li><strong>Suggestions and Ideas</strong><br>
 I've had a fair number of 
people offer to help with the site or with building add-ons, but they need some 
useful ideas to get them going.Tell me what would help you and I'll see if 
someone else will pick up the task of putting it together... or email me if 
you'd like to be a helper too...

<li><strong>An Allaire/MM dedicated ASP-issues point-of-contact person</strong>
<br> ...and it <em>had</em> come to pass... need a new one though since Dan N. 
left. 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>More HomeSite-installable Help/Doc Sets</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Microsoft ADO Programmer's Reference </li> 
<li>Client Document Object Model, the Scripting Object Model and the Server 
Object Model (<em>any idea where to get these?</em>) </li> 
<li>PerlScript </li> 
<li>Better vbscript and jscript docs sets (decompiled?) </li> 
<li>Reference material for WSH in general </li> </ul> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>A complete article on using Microsoft's Script Debugger with 
HomeSite</strong><br>
 Darren Forcier  at allaire posted a short write-up on it 
and mentioned that he might get to write this once things settle there a bit. 
This free debugger is good for developing and debugging ASP scripts and also 
VTOM/WSH scripts. See also DevGuru'sA Beginner's Guide to Using Microsoft 
Script Debugger 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>More Custom Dialogs</strong><br>
 Keith Collison's ASP Database 
dialog proves that we can build VTM dialogs that can generate code based upon 
easy user inputs for a variety of circumstances. We could use more of these 
tools to generate generic or customized-generic code to do common useful tasks 
in ASP.
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Useful function snippets</strong><br>
 There have got to be lots 
of small, generic, useful functions that could be put in snippet sets. Perhaps 
some from the tutorial examples atLearnASP.Com. 
<p></p></li> 
<li>Does anyone have a good <strong>ASP button gif</strong>? There used to be 
a neat animated one around, but I can't find it now.
<p></p> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Frontpage Extensions Upload capability (web folders)</strong><br>
 
Frontpage extensions provide a way other than FTP to upload web files. Some 
servers are set to reject ftp and only use this upload method. Users have 
requested that HomeSite be able to directly upload or deploy using this method.

<li><strong>Forum threads</strong><br>
 Here are a few forum threads with a 
number of HS/ASP requests.
<ul> 
<li>ASP requests </li> 
<li>ASP Support Wish List 
<ul> 
<li>Code completion for intrinsic objects and user created objects </li> 
<li>Stronger ASP recognition/color coding </li> 
<li>Database connection wizard </li> 
<li>COM object wizard/browser </li> 
<li>Support (i.e wizards) for Remote Scripting </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<li>An add-on that would DIM all the variables on a page for you. 
--Tom&nbsp;King (<em>Note: this is probably not feasible without creating a 
full vbscript parser. Easier to put Option Explicit in the code and see what 
error messages you get to find any vars you forgot to Dim. -jeff</em>) 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Make it easier to add toolbar buttons for VTM scripts and Apps
</strong><br>
 It would make it far easier to add add-ins (vtom scripts, etc) 
if HS could work such that dragging-n-dropping a vtm file over a toolbar would 
open up the add custom button dialog, already filled in to add it as a button 
to that toolbar. It would sure be easier than the currentmany-step method of 
creating buttons.
<p>This should also work for dropping other executable files over a toolbar. 
If I drop PSP.EXE, it should help me set up a button to launch it as an 
application with paths already filled in, and even suggest using %CURRENT% in 
the command line. (thread) </p>
<p>Related to this is John's suggesion: &quot;<em>It would be useful to be 
able to edit HS extensions directly from the HS editor. IE I could write a JS 
or VBS file and have access to the HS application DOM via insight and I could 
also have a &quot;Test&quot; option to execute it directly and options to add 
it straight away to toolbars, menus etc. Right clicking a custom button already 
in a toolbar would also give me the option to edit it straight away.</em>&quot;
