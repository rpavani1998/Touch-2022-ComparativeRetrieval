<h1>Chapter 67. PHP and other languages</h1> 
<p> PHP is the best language for web programing, but what about other 
languages?</p>

<p><b>1. </b>PHP vs. ASP?</p> </b> 
<p><b> </b> ASP is not really a language in itself, it's an acronym for Active 
Server Pages, the actual language used to program ASP with is Visual Basic 
Script or JScript. The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a proprietary 
system that is natively used only on Microsoft Internet Information Server 
(IIS). This limits it's availability to Win32 based servers. There are a couple 
of projects in the works that allows ASP to run in other environments and 
webservers:InstantASP from Halcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from Chili!Soft 
(commercial). ASP is said to be a slower and more cumbersome language than PHP, 
less stable as well. Some of the pros of ASP is that since it primarily uses 
VBScript it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you're already know 
how to program in Visual Basic. ASP support is also enabled by default in the 
IIS server making it easy to get up and running. The components built in ASP 
are really limited, so if you need to use &quot;advanced&quot; features like 
interacting with FTP servers, you need to buy additional components.</p> <b> 
<p><b>2. </b>Is there an ASP to PHP converter?</p> </b> 
<p><b> </b> Yes, the server-side asp2php is the one most often referred to as 
well asthis client-side option. </p> <b> 
<p><b>3. </b>PHP vs. Cold Fusion?</p> </b> 
<p><b> </b> PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex 
programming tasks and trying out new ideas. PHP is generally referred to as 
more stable and less resource intensive as well. Cold Fusion has better error 
handling, database abstraction and date parsing although database abstraction 
is addressed in PHP 4. Another thing that is listed as one of Cold Fusion's 
strengths is its excellent search engine, but it has been mentioned that a 
search engine is not something that should be included in a web scripting 
language. PHP runs on almost every platform there is; Cold Fusion is only 
available on Win32, Solaris, Linux and HP/UX. Cold Fusion has a good IDE and is 
generally easier to get started with, whereas PHP initially requires more 
programming knowledge. Cold Fusion is designed with non-programmers in mind, 
while PHP is focused on programmers.</p> 
<p> A great summary by Michael J Sheldon on this topic has been posted to the 
PHP mailing list. A copy can be found at

<b> 
<p><b>4. </b>PHP vs. Perl?</p> </b> 
<p><b> </b> The biggest advantage of PHP over Perl is that PHP was designed 
for scripting for the web where Perl was designed to do a lot more and can 
because of this get very complicated. The flexibility / complexity of Perl 
makes it easier to write code that another author / coder has a hard time 
reading. PHP has a less confusing and stricter format without losing 
flexibility. PHP is easier to integrate into existing HTML than Perl. PHP has 
pretty much all the 'good' functionality of Perl: constructs, syntax and so on, 
without making it as complicated as Perl can be. Perl is a very tried and true 
language, it's been around since the late eighties, but PHP is maturing very 
quickly.</p> Prev Home Next <br>

 I would rather see a sermon than hear one any day. 
I'd rather have you walk with me, than merely point the way. The eye is a more 
ready pupil than ever was the ear, good advice is often confusing, but example 
is always clear.<br>
