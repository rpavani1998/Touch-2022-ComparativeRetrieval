PHP Roadmap</b><br>
<br>
By <strong>James Murphy</strong><br>
<br>
 We expect 
our readers to have a more than firm handle on what PHP is, but for 
completeness-sake: PHP (a recursive acronym of PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor) is 
an open source, server-side web-scripting language for creating dynamic pages. 
Outside of it being browser independent, if offers a simple and universal 
cross-platform solution for e-commerce, and complex web and data-driven 
applications.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why PHP?</strong> <br>
<br>
 PHP has: <br>
<br>
 
# A low, smooth learning curve.<br>
<br>
 # Broad functionality for databases, 
strings, network connectivity, file system support, Java, COM, XML, CORBA, 
WDDX, and Macromedia Flash.<br>
<br>
 # Platform compatibility with UNIX (all 
variants), Win32 (NT/95/98/2000), QNX, MacOS (WebTen), OSX, OS/2, and BeOS.<br>

<br> # Server compatibility for Apache module (UNIX, Win32), CGI/FastCGI, 
thttpd, fhttpd, phttpd, ISAPI (ISS, Zeus), NSAPI (Netscape iPlanet), Java 
servlet engines, AOLServer, and Roxen/Caudium module.<br>
<br>
 # A rapid 
development cycle. New versions with bug fixes, additional functionality, and 
other improvements are released every few months.<br>
<br>
 # A vibrant and 
supportive community. Code examples and free code abound. The PHP group has 
done an excellent job of providing new users with resources and support.<br>

<br> # Easy extensibility. We can easily roll out our own extensions to the 
language.<br>
<br>
 # A simple syntax that resembles C. It&#146;s easy for 
experienced C, C++, Perl and shell coders to pick up PHP.<br>
 Plus, it&#146;s 
open source, and it&#146;s free.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP Evolution</strong> <br>

<br> If you&#146;re new to PHP, here&#146;s a quick run down on where it&#146;s 
been, where it is now, and where it&#146;s going.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP Past 
</strong><br>
<br>
 We will tersely summarize the history of PHP here, but we 
urge readers interested in the historical aspects of PHP development to review 
the introductory PHP presentations athttp://conf.php.net/ or read the Brief 
History section in the PHP/FI 2 manual athttp://php.net/docs.php. <br>
<br>
 
Rasmus Lerdorf conceived the idea of PHP in the fall of 1994. Version 1 of the 
language was implemented in the early 1995 and was embraced by a handful of 
users, following which Version 2 was released later the same year. Version 3 
and 4 followed in 1997 and 2000 respectively.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP Present
</strong> <br>
<br>
 As of the time of writing, PHP usage is growing at a rate 
of 15% each month, and is in use on at least twenty million domains (Source: 
Netcraft Survey), which is about 20% of all the domains registered so far. This 
is a significant chunk of the market, given that these figures do not account 
for the multitude of installations that run on intranets and private 
development servers.<br>
<br>
 PHP runs on 7 major platforms (stable), 10 
server interfaces (stable), supports 40 stable extensions (and about as many 
experimental ones), and offers support to over 20 databases. These figures are 
testimony to the fact that PHP has grown to its current popularity based on its 
power and ease of use.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP Future</strong> <br>
<br>
 The PHP5 
scripting engine is a second revision of the PHP4 scripting engine, and 
provides more obvious intrastate and services to the function modules, and 
implements the language syntax. This revised version is largely based on the 
same parsing rules as the PHP4 engine, thus providing goof backward 
compatibility and migration path from PHP4 to PHP5. But the downside is the 
limited scope of language-level improvements, to the PHP4 mindset.<br>
<br>
 
With feedback from a multitude of PHP developers, Zend Technologies Ltd has 
embarked on a revision of the Zend Engine that will incorporate the PHP 
developers experience today. We urge you to add
http://www.zend.com/zend/future.php to your list of favourite, and also 
subscribe to the Zend 2.0 monitoring the PHP roadmap.<br>

<br>
<strong>PHP vs. Other Scripting Languages</strong> <br>
<br>
 For those who have migrated form other scripting languages, we have detailed a 
section on why you just made the right choice.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP vs. ASP
</strong> <br>
<br>
 ASP (Active Server Pages) is Microsoft&#146;s proprietary 
scripting &#147;language&#148;. Loosely speaking, ASP isn&#146;t a language, 
but a scripting extension of Visual Basic. For this reason, ASP is relatively 
easy to pick up for anyone who is familiar with Visual Basic.<br>
<br>
 
Disadvantages? For one, ASP is generally slower than PHP. ASP is fundamental 
user of COM-based architecture. So, when an ASP programmer accesses the 
database and writes to the client, they&#146;re calling upon the COM strictures 
of another NT server or an OS layer to assist. This COM overhead can add up and 
results in average performance for anything more than medium-traffic simple 
page delivery. Also, ASP isn&#146;t exactly ready to port and integrate with 
GNU tools and open source environments or servers.<br>
<br>
 Since it&#146;s a 
proprietary system of Microsoft, it is mostly used on their Internet 
Information server (IIS), which limits common adoption of ASP to Windows 32 bit 
systems &#150; where it comes as a free piece of code to most server customers. 
There are versions for UNIX 9see Chilli Soft ASP) and several ASP concern. A 
solution to this problem might be to use the asp2php program 
(http://asp2psp.maken.cc/), which will convert ASP to PHP.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP 
vs. Cold Fusion</strong> <br>
<br>
 PHP runs on virtually every platform; Cold 
Fusion is only available on Win32, Solaris, Linux, and HP/US. PHP initially 
requires more programming knowledge in contrast with Cold Fusion, which has a 
refined IDE and simpler language constructs. PHP is less resource intensive.<br>
<br> <strong>PHP vs. Perl</strong> <br>
<br>
 Since PHP was designed 
specifically for the Web, it has the upper hand on Perl in this area, since 
Perl was designed for myriad applications (and consequently looks the part). 
The format and syntax of Perl can make a Perl script hard to read and modify 
later when updates are needed.<br>
<br>
 Though Perl has been around for quite 
some time (it was developed in the late 1980s), and is widely supported, it has 
grown into a complex structure of additions and extensions and is imply just 
too much. PHP has a less confusing format without losing its flexible nature. 
PHP is easier to integrate into existing HTML and offers similar functionality 
to Perl, but with so much more grace.<br>
<br>
<strong>PHP vs. Java</strong> 
<br> <br>
 PHP is simpler to use than Java and makes it easier to architect web 
applications while also gaining similar advantages of flexibility and 
scalability. Using PHP doesn&#146;t require 5 years of software engineering 
experience to create simple, dynamic pages and can be used by savvy, but 
inexperienced, computer programmers.<br>
<br>
 Java is often expensive too, as 
most companies end up having a stand alone box to run Java enterprise and use 
Oracle and other expensive software. Having said all that, PHP still has to 
grow and in that it&#146;s not as portable or doesn&#146;t have some of the 
nice features like object pooling or database mapping as in Java. These issues 
are being addressed in the Zend 2.0 engine design consideration.<br>
<br>

<strong>PHP Licensing</strong> <br>
<br>
 PHP was earlier released under both 
GPL (General Public Licence) and its own licence, which left the individual 
user free to choose the licence they preferred. Now the program as a while is 
released under its own extremely laissez-faire PHP4 licence.<br>
<br>
 At the 
time of writing, the Zend licence was release under the QPL (Q Public Licence). 
Please referhttp://www.zend.com/licence/ZendLicence/ for more details. Also 
quoted in their press release in the change to BSD-style licence, to provide 
compatibility with the PHP licence, and offer greater freedom of development.
