<h2>Asp4Hs: Why use HomeSite for ASP? (or PHP)</h2>  [ Asp4Hs | 
Add-On's&nbsp;List | Articles | WishList | Links | Tips/FAQs | Submissions ] 
<br> 
<p>You may be asking why I'm bothering to build this site or why anyone would 
want to useHomeSite for Active Server Pages (ASP) development, especially when 
MSVisual Interdev exists as a relatively mature tool designed specifically for 
ASP development.</p> 
<p>There are actually quite a few good reasons to consider HomeSite for ASP, 
or for PHP which is very similar.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>HomeSite is widely considered to be the best code-based (as opposed to 
WYSIWYG) HTML editor available for the PC platform. It provides a fast, mature 
editing environment and a user interface second to none for HTML editing plus a 
strong set of supporting integrated tools.
<p></p></li> 
<li>From the beginning, HomeSite has been designed to allow and encourage 
extension of most of its features. This was partly to help keep up with the 
constantly changing world of HTML, but also to allow users to customize it to 
how they work and code. Some of the features that can be extended include:
<ul> 
<li>language syntax coloring schemes </li> 
<li>help system doc sets </li> 
<li>tag definitions, tag inspector and tag editing dialogs </li> 
<li>tag and function insight </li> 
<li>validation of HTML, CFML, SMIL, WML, JSP, etc </li> 
<li>snippets (sets of user-created bits of code or text) </li> 
<li>WSH scripts (ActiveScript) </li> 
<li>toolbars and other user interface elements </li> 
<li>custom wizards </li> 
<li>color palettes </li> 
<li>codesweeper profiles </li> </ul> 
<p>This design for extension provides many areas where users can create simple 
or complex add-on's to support their preferred languages and coding styles, 
including ASP, vbscript and jscript. These add-on's may be easily shared with 
others, as this sitedemonstrates. </p>
<p></p></li> 
<li>HomeSite is a code-based editor. This means that, unlike WYSIWYG-style 
editors, it doesn't change your code. It has various aids which can help you 
enter or format code, but they are all optional.
<p></p></li> 
<li>HomeSite is easy to learn. It has an intuitive interface and good 
documentation that will help you to be up and productive your first day of use, 
yet it offers advanced features that you can learn and use when you're ready.
<p></p></li> 
<li>Many web developers are used to the HomeSite editing environment and like 
to continue to use it as they move to ASP coding rather than move to a new tool.
<p></p></li> 
<li>As Bart Gerardi says (in his ASPToday article below), HomeSite it can be 
used as a code editor for many technologies, allowing you to transport it from 
one language to another, Microsoft-related or not. Allaire and various users 
have provided syntax coloring parsers and other tools to support a variety of 
technologies including ASP, ColdFusion, HTMLscript, Javascript, JSP, PHP, Perl, 
SQL and more.
<p></p></li> 
<li>HomeSite has integrated tools that greatly simplify many common web 
development tasks. These include code validation, link checking, document 
weight, spell checking, code cleanup (Codesweeper andHTML Tidy) and a powerful 
search and replace function. In fact, the extended search &amp; replace can do 
either normal or regular expression finds or s&amp;r's across a great many 
files very quickly. Most of these tools can work across sets of either all open 
files, a directory (or dir tree), or a project.
<p></p></li> 
<li>Other external tools can be integrated with HomeSite in a number of ways. 
Some tools that work well with HomeSite include theCSE HTML Validator, HTML Tidy
,Topstyle CSS Editor, and Linkbot. 
<p></p></li> 
<li>Macromedia/Allaire, the producers of HomeSite, are extremely responsive to 
suggestions and requests from users. Theforums are very active and most of the 
current features and implementation of HomeSite, from major features to minute 
details, can be traced back to user requests or discussions.
<p></p></li> 
<li>HomeSite's Snippets feature gives developers a way to keep sets of 
organized bits of code or text for quick reuse. For team development, HomeSite 
provides shared snippets sets in addition to the private snippets.
<p></p></li> 
<li>Since ASP or PHP files must be be passed through a webserver before they 
are generally viewable in a browser, it is often difficult to view them in an 
editor. HomeSite providesServer Mappings that let you pass files through a 
webserver before they are shown in the internal viewer. This is useful not only 
for ASP, but also for other technologies such as SSI, PHP or any server-side 
execution.
<p></p></li> 
<li>HomeSite can interface to a wide range of standard source and version 
control applications to provide this essential function for either team or 
individual development projects. It also has powerful and flexibleproject 
management functionality. 
<p></p></li> 
<li>Cost-wise, HomeSite is quite inexpensive compared to it's competitors, a 
factor which can be important for small developers, beginners or home users as 
well as in larger corporate environments.</li> </ol> 
<p>So... are you using HomeSite for ASP or PHP yet?<br>
 If not, why not?<br>
 
Tell me your reasons either way.<br>
<em>--&nbsp;Jeff&nbsp;Wilkinson</em></p> 
<p>Just as a note, I've been told there was an ASPwire instant poll survey (in 
1999?) that had the following question and answer:<em>Which editor do you use 
to develop ASP?</em> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Interdev:39% 
HomeSite:21% Notepad:17% ASP Xpress:10% Other:12%<br>
