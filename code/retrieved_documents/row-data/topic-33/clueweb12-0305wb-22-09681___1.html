<h1>PHP, ASP and Whitebeam</h1> <br>

<p>This page provides some comparison between PHP, ASP and Whitebeam in order 
to introduce Whitebeam to people familiar with those technologies. If you 
haven't used these technologies then you may be better placed reading the full
tutorial on writing Whitebeam applications.</p>
<p>The subjects covered are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The layout of pages - comparing Whitebeam against PHP and ASP</li> 
<li>Markup - How Whitebeam uses XML to move beyond scripting</li> 
<li>Libraries - Interfaces to backend technologies</li> 
<li>Scaleability - What happens when your application outgrows your current 
server - or the currently available fastest serer?</li> 
<li>...and finally a Summary</li> </ul> 
<h1>Page structure</h1>
<p>ASP, PHP and Whitebeam all store programs in text files, and each of those 
files contain special markers that highlight where to insert dynamically 
generated content. In the Whitebeam environment these files generally have the 
extension '.rhtm' or '.whtm' but of course you can use any extension. The 
following shows two similar pages - one for PHP and one for Whitebeam</p> PHP 
Whitebeam <br>
<code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?php // Server-side PHP $msg 
= &quot;Hello World&quot;; echo(); ?&gt; &lt;?= &quot;The message 
is'$msg'&quot; ?&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre></code> <code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?rbscript // Server-side 
JavaScript var msg = &quot;Hello World&quot;; ?&gt; &lt;?= &quot;The message is 
'&quot;+msg+&quot;'&quot; ?&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre></code> <br>

<br>
<p>The major difference between the structure of Whitebeam pages and those of 
the other two technologies is that Whitebeam files<b>must</b> be <strong>valid
</strong> XML markup. Whitebeam is an <b>XML Application</b>, while the other 
two are more simply text substitution processors. XML is an inherent feature of 
Whitebeam. Although PHP uses XML 'friendly' syntax - the files are<strong>not
</strong> XML. This is illustrated by the perfectly valid PHP file:</p><code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?php $aValue = 22 ?&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;&lt;?php echo($aValue)?&gt;&quot;&gt; ...</pre></code>
<p>As far as PHP or ASP are concerned - a program file has no structure - it 
is a text file on which simple text substitution is performed.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Whitebeam is an XML engine that invokes a script engine as necessary. A 
Whitebeam file is an XML file and can be manipulated as such and used with 
existing XML editing tools.</li> 
<li>ASP, PHP are text based technologies - they have no intrinsic awareness of 
XML or document structure</li> </ul>
<p>This difference may seem rather subtle - and if all you do with Whitebeam 
is to write PHP like applications but using JavaScript then the differences 
will probably not be apparent. However by making Whitebeam an XML application - 
and having the programs structured using valid XML unleashes a whole set of 
additional facilities such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Use XML and HTML editors to see document structure</b><br>
 Many PHP 
and ASP applications hide all their output in streams of print statements. The 
only way you can see the output structure is by running the application and 
looking at the output. A Whitebeam page allows you to represent the application 
structure in XML, which can be modified using commercial XML/HTML editors such 
as dreamweaver.</li> 
<li><b>Attach JavaScript behaviour to XML tags</b><br>
 Whitebeam allows you 
to create your own new tags and attach JavaScript behaviour to them. For 
example - create a tag for a menu item. Whenever the engine encounters that tag 
when it executes the page it runs the associated JavaScript - the outoput from 
the script replaces the tag in the output document sent to the client.<br>
<br>

 You can also use this behaviour to 'transform' existing tags. I could for 
example redfine &lt;h1&gt; tag to automatically insert a link at the start of a 
page whenever it is encounrtered, providing an automatic table of contents.</li>
<li><strong>DOM manipulation of the source</strong><br>
 Because a Whitebeam 
page is an XML document at the lowest level - Whitebeam provides a DOM like 
access to that document structure at run time. You can included a number of XML 
sub-structures within your doucment - then select the appropriate on for 
output, maybe based on browser or current section number or type of person 
logged into the site.</li> </ul> 
<h1>Beyond Scripts</h1>
<p>ASP and PHP provide mechanisms that can substitute 'output' in place of 
'script'. In the ASP and PHP the<strong>only</strong> way of achieving this is 
through script, which can make the pages being generated look very clumsy, 
which in turn makes maintainance and development more difficult and costly.</p>
<p>In a Whitebeam application, JavaScript is primarily a technology for adding 
procedural functionality to pages. Page structure on the other hand is best 
described in an XML markup language, which Whitebeam provides as a set ofXML 
markup that is embedded in application pages.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this improves the structure of a page consider the 
following simple example of repeating a block of output for rows in a table:</p>
PHP Whitebeam <br>
<code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;?php for 
($i=0;$i&lt;count($rows);$i++) ?&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Row &lt;?= $i 
?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $rows[$i] ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;?php&gt; endfor; ?&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</code> <code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;rb:repeatfor 
expr=&quot;var i=0;i&lt;rows.length;i++)&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Row 
&lt;?= i ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= rows[i] ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;/rb:repeatfor&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre></code> 
<br> <br>

<p>Or an even simpler example - conditionally including a block of text if a 
user is logged into the system</p> PHP Whitebeam <br>
<code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?php if ($isLoggedIn) ?&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our application!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;?php&gt; endif; ?&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre></code> <code>
<pre> &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello 
World&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p 
rb:test=&quot;isLoggedIn&quot;&gt; Welcome back to our application &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre></code> <br>
<br>

<p>This latter example also illustrates the power of a system that understands 
the XML hierarchy. An entire block of XML can be conditionally included simply 
by making the parent tag conditional (rb:test) on the result of a JavaScript 
expression.</p>
<p>Whitebeam provides a rich set of XML markup to allow you to define your pae 
structure rather than having to use PHP control constructs.</p> 
<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>We've covered the basic syntax of Whitebeam and how JavaScript and XML 
markup combne to provide a powerful development framework. We've shown the 
syntactical similarities between Whitebeam, ASP and PHP. The XML structure of a 
Whitebeam page makes it very easy to build XML based applications. By itself 
this functionality has little practical use. It could for example be used as a 
more understandable translation language than XSLT, for those familiar with 
standard procedural languages, but that's about it!</p>
<p>To write an application requires access to a number of underlying 
functional technologies. Obvious among these are the ability to store 
persistent data between page access, recognise client sessions and associated 
data, implement a robust security model etc. Each development environment 
provides these in a different way, but in each as an underlying application 
programming interface (API).</p>
<h2>The PHP approach</h2>
<p>PHP provides a very rich API built as a set of function calls to underlying 
modular interfaces. As PHP has developed and grown a larger following so more 
effort has been placed into adding interfaces to just about any kind of 
function you could need for a web application. This is perhaps one of the 
strengths, and weaknesses of the PHP environment. The libraries cover a lot of 
functionality, but has been implemented by a wide variety of organisations and 
individuals. The result is a feature rich environment, but one that can be 
daunting to new users of the environment.</p>
<p>The APIs provided to PHP developers also tend to be very <i>thin</i>, in 
that they map almost directly down to an underlying applications interface. The 
result is very little consistency and very little abstraction, leading to a 
different API to talk to, for example, Postgres, mySql and DB2, despite the 
fact that they are all SQL databases. To see the breadth of coveragevisit the 
PHP documentation library</p>
<p>The philosophy followed by the PHP libraries tends to mean that you have to 
know a lot about the underlying technology before you can use an API.</p>
<p>PHP effectively provides a procedural interface allowing direct access to 
underlying software, but to use that technology you must learn both PHP - and 
how to use that technology. To write a database driven application using
PostgreSQL for example you to learn PHP, HTML <i>and</i>SQL.</p>
<h2>Whitebeam Libraries</h2>
<p>Whitebeam provides an intuitive, well documented object orientated set of 
APIs that abstract away the underlying complexity in order to reduce barriers 
to entry for new users. While developers<i>can</i> get down to the underlying 
functionality, it is perfectly possible to build a feature rich database driven 
application without ever having to learn SQL. Even where the user wishes to get 
to the underlying functionality the Whitebeam aim is to provide a consistent 
interface to similar techologies. You really shouldn't have to change your code 
substantially to move from one database technology to another!</p>
<p>Whitebeam library functionality falls into two main categories:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Session/request related functions</strong><br>
 For example 
sending text to the browser, reading data from a form, accessing session 
information associated with this request.</li> 
<li><strong>Other associated objects</strong><br>
 Covering making HTTP 
requests, sending emails, making database connections etc. These are generally 
objects that are transient and last for a single browser page request only.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these is represented as an object called 'rb'. This object 
contains a set of objects representing different aspects of the current 
operating environment, for example sessions, catalogues, sessions and the page 
generation itself. You'll find alist of all the Whitebeam classes here.</p>
<p>The second, transient objects, are represented by a number of classes 
within the system. So an HTTP request is represented by an instance of the 
'HttpRequest' class.</p> 
<h1>Scaleability</h1>
<p>PHP has evolved over time from a fairly basic origins - the system 
developed from the scripting language. Most of the functionality available to 
developers is in the form of added libraries. Most of these have been developed 
to for the most common 'single-server' web application environment. 
Scaleability has never been a major issue addressed by the developers of PHP. 
There is no doubt that you can develop reliable, scaleable applications, but in 
that case you have to write your own framework to make it happen.</p>
<p>The core libraries provided with PHP lend themselves to single server 
applications. The standard session management functions store session 
information in a file on the local file-system. If you have a vedry successful 
site and your server can't cope, your general solution is to get a bigger 
server. If you have the biggest server you can afford then your only options 
are to replace the core functionality with your own session tracking code, 
using for example a database to store session information.</p>
<p>Whitebeam luckily inherited a very mature, industry standard scripting 
environment (ECMAScript/JavaScript thanks to the guys atMozilla). Our interest 
was not in providing the language but rather in how to harness that language to 
develop scaleable applications. All of the standard libraries in Whitebeam have 
been developed with scaleability in mind. Using standard libraries, if you have 
performance issues, you can make use of industry stanard load balancers to run 
your application on two servers concurrently. None of your code has to change 
because the Whitebeam architecture separates session data into a separate 
service accessible by all servers.</p> 
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Whitebeam has a number of similarities with PHP and ASP. Page layout can 
look very similar and you can do very similar things with each of these 
technologies.</p>
<p>Whitebeam very much builds on these architectures using internationally 
standardised building blocks of XML and ECMAscript. Where PHP and ASP process a 
text page for embedded script, Whitebeam introduces a two-parse approach, 
processing an properly formatted XML file and then executing behaviours 
associated with specific XML markup within those pages. Whitebeams knowledge of 
the structure of the page as a hierachy of tags allows some very sophisticated 
manipulations to be achieved very easily.</p>
<p>Alongside the core page structure, Whitebeam provides a rich set of data 
storage and manipulation allowing sophisticated database driven applications to 
be written with no knowledge of the underlying technologies. Whitebeam 
abstracts away the need to learn SQL or other technologies. At the same time it 
provides those interfaces if required for specialist applications.</p>
<p>Finally Whitebeam addresses in a transparent manner the issue of 
scaleability and reliability, allowing a developer to take an application 
initially running on a single server and to run that same application unchanged 
on multiple servers using standard load-balancing products.</p>
