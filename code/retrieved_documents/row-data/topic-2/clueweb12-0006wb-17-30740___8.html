<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>May 7 2011</em> - Alienware's latest gaming laptop comes in the form of 
the larger than life 18.4-inch M18x system that features a 1920 x 1080 full HD 
display. Unfortunately, the base M18x is somewhat underwhelming for the price 
with only 4GB of memory, a small 320GB hard drive, and an average NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 460M 1.5GB graphics card. Luckily, the Alienware M18x can be 
configured with lots of options, such as dual GeForce GTX 460M graphics card in 
SLI or two AMD Radeon HD 6970M video cards in CrossFireX configuration. The 
overall design is nice with programmable macro keys and a cool backlit keyboard.

<h3>Review - Alienware M18x Gaming Laptop PC</h3>

<p>Do you often feel that a 17-inch display just isn't big enough? The new 
Alienware M18x is geared toward gamers who want just a little more room for a 
gaming experience as close to the feel of a desktop as possible. Starting at 
$1,999 for the base configuration, the system is on the upper end of the price 
tier - even for a large 18-inch system.</p> 
<p>Since the massive 18-inch display is a definite draw for gamers, the 
display better be good. The 18.4-inch screen is capable of a maximum resolution 
of 1920 x 1080, which is full HD. However, for the price, it would be nice if a 
higher resolution screen was available considering the display's dimensions, 
even if it did cost more.</p> 
<p>For nearly $2,000, the Alienware M18x is equipped with an Intel Core 
i7-2630 quad-core mobile processor. This chip runs at 2.0GHz with Turbo Boost 
speeds up to 2.8GHz. Although this is a fast CPU since it deploys Sandy Bridge 
architecture, it is disappointing that Dell (owner of the Alienware brand) puts 
the more economical Core i7 in the $1,999 model, even if upgrades are 
available. For an additional $150, the processor can be changed to an Intel 
Core i7-2720QM, but this chip also features 6MB of L3 cache. Basically, if you 
are using single threaded applications, you will benefit from the 2720's 
increased Turbo Boost speed of 3.3GHz over the 2630's 2.8GHz Turbo speed. 
Otherwise, the upgrade may not be worth the added cost.</p> 
<p>Dell also equips the base M18x with 4GB of DDR3 1333MHz memory. For this 
price, it's disappointing since competing gaming laptops usually have 8GB. To 
make this laptop more future proof, you'll definitely want to consider adding 
more memory, especially since $2,000 or more spent on a laptop is quite an 
investment. The laptop supports up to 32GB with memory speeds up to 1600MHz.</p>
<p>The hard drive is also quite small for a gaming laptop. Gamers typically 
want more space to store applications, multimedia content, and more. The 
Alienware M18x has a 320GB 7200RPM hard drive in the base model, which just 
isn't spacious enough for most users. It's worth considering upgrading to a 
hybrid drive, which is more economical than a full-on SSD. The Alienware M18x 
also supports RAID, so you can have two 500GB hybrid drives in RAID 0 for $250 
more.</p> 
<p>Also included in the standard configuration is an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M 
1.5GB graphics card. This model is slightly above midrange level with 192 CUDA 
cores and a texture fill rate of 16.1 billion per second. Available upgrades 
include adding a second NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M in SLI or going for two AMD 
Radeon 6970M cards in CrossFireX for an enhanced gaming experience albeit at a 
high expense as well.</p> 
<p>For those wanting to game in 3D, the Alienware M18x does support 
WirelessHD, which is a $99 option. For that price, you can play games or watch 
content on a compatible HDTV without the wires and without compression thanks 
to a max 4Gbps transfer rate. Since the card runs on the 60GHz wireless 
frequency, it doesn't interfere with your regular wireless network. Please be 
aware, though, that viewing 3D content requires compatible equipment. 
Unfortunately, if you want to watch HD movies on the M18x, you'll have to 
splurge on an optional Blu-ray drive which is an extra $150. The downside is 
that all of these options really drive the price up.</p> 
<p>If you're looking for a larger than life desktop replacement, the choices 
are quite limited. The Alienware M18x fills that void but with a hefty price 
tag. It would be nice if certain options were available to users, such as a 
higher resolution display and a more powerful single graphics card solution. 
However, if money is not an option it's very possible to configure the 
Alienware M18x into a powerful gaming laptop that performs at desktop levels 
in-game. For the price, though, you do get a cool looking notebook with nice 
lighting and gamer-specific features such as programmable macro key controls.
