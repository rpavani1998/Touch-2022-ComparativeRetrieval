<h1>Laptop VS. Desktop</h1> &nbsp; 
<p></p> 
<p>Image via Wikipedia</p> 
<p>If you are in the market to buy a new personal computer, you may be having 
a hard time deciding between buying a laptop or a desktop.</p> 
<h4>The Laptop</h4> 
<p>The laptop has many obvious benefits. The main one being that it is 
portable. Other benefits of the laptop include it being lightweight and using 
up less space in your home than a desk top.</p> 
<p>A laptop is a good option if you are living in confined quarters. They can 
used on just about any surface, and can even be used on your lap (hence the 
name) if you not have any available workspace.</p> 
<p>There has been a turnaround in pricing trends over the past few months. 
Whereas laptops were marginally higher priced than a desktop computer, some 
manufacturers are putting very economically priced laptops on the market. They 
may not have all the features that the more expensive laptops and desktop 
versions have but they are never the less good value for money.</p> 
<h4>The Desktop</h4> 
<p>The desktop computer is obviously less portable than a laptop. However, if 
you want a personal computer that will perform better, then a desktop will be 
your best option.</p> 
<p>If you want a computer for tasks such as video and photo editing, and even 
gaming, then a desktop will be able to hold more of the requirements than a 
laptop. When it comes to repairs, a desktop computer is more economical to run 
and repair than a laptop. Desktops are also more robust than laptops. If you 
have small children or even heavy handed adults, then a desktop is a better 
option for them</p>
