<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 8 2010</em> - Dell's Inspiron 17R is a 
slimmed down desktop replacement that provides a more compact and lightweight 
design. This high end model comes equipped with a higher resolution display and 
Blu-ray drive. At $1000, there are less expensive Blu-ray equipped systems or 
models with better graphics for gaming. It does a decent job of being a good 
general purpose desktop replacement without costing too much. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Blu-ray Drive</li> 
<li>Good Performance</li> 
<li>Software Installation Free Of Much Bloatware</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3>

<li>Display Can't Handle 1080p HD Video</li>

<h3>Guide Review - Dell Inspiron 17R 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop PC
</h3> 
<p><em>Jul 8 2010</em> - Dell's Inspiron 17R is their latest revision of their 
consumer desktop replacement laptop. This includes a new external case design 
that has a sleeker look and profile that the last version. The glossy exterior 
will quickly pick up fingerprints and smudges but the interior is a bit more 
resistant albeit still glossy.</p> 
<p>Powering the Inspiron 17R is the new Intel 2010 Core mobile processors. In 
the unit reviewed, a moderate level Core i5-450M dual core processor is teamed 
up with 4GB of DDR3 memory. This provides for a very smooth overall experience 
in most computing tasks. It will fall short of higher end Core i5 and Core i7 
processors but most people probably won't see the difference unless they do 
video editing or similar heavy computing tasks.</p> 
<p>While the majority of the Inspiron 17R units come with a standard dual 
layer DVD burner, this $1000 version includes a Blu-ray combo drive. This 
allows the system to be used as a mobile high definition Blu-ray player or for 
playback and recording of CD and DVD media. The 500GB hard drive is fairly 
typical of the desktop replacement market now and provides a good amount of 
space for applications and data. It does spin at a more traditional 5400rpm 
spin rate rather than the faster 7200rpm desktop rate which impacts performance 
slightly.</p> 
<p>With the inclusion of a Blu-ray drive, a high resolution LCD panel would be 
expected. The 17.3-inch panel uses a 1600x900 resolution that falls short of 
providing full 1080p HD video support. The panel does use an LED backlight that 
provides a good level of color but a tad bit more subdued in brightness. It 
uses a standard glossy coating like most laptops do now that can be prone to 
glare and reflections in certain lighting conditions. It does use an ATI Radeon 
Mobility HD 5470 dedicated graphics with 1GB of memory but series gamers will 
want to look elsewhere. It is sufficient for handling all HD video streaming 
and casual PC gaming but will likely have to play 3D games below the panel's 
full resolution.lt;/p&gt;</p> 
<p>To keep the profile slimmer on the Inspiron 17R, Dell ships most with a 
standard 6-cell battery pack. In my DVD playback tests, this resulted in under 
three hours before going into standby mode. In more traditional computing 
usage, this should translate to roughly three and a half to four hours of 
usage. This falls squarely in the middle of the desktop replacement laptops in 
terms of battery life. An optional 9-cell battery pack option is available that 
will give it more running time but add to its bulk and cost.</p> 
<p>One nice aspect of Dell's latest computers is the limited amount of 
software installed on them. The Inspiron 17R comes with a few key applications 
but without as much bloat as competing systems which clutter the system and 
performance.</p> <br>
