<h1>Training Tips, Online and Off </h1> 
<h3>April 29th, 2010</h3> <br>

<p>From the start, the educational potential of the Internet was a source of 
tremendous excitement. There is a wealth ofonline training available today, in 
every imaginable subject, with many top universities and evenelite Ivy League 
institutions delivering courses, counseling, certificates and degrees on the 
Web. It&rsquo;s even better for ongoing education and professional 
certification, as well as for people who want to learn specific skills or 
knowledge without a degree program.</p> 
<p>At CRE, we support all kinds of businesses in every industry, but have a 
particular expertise outfitting creative people &ndash; designers, audio 
engineers, video pros, marketing mavens &ndash; with powerful media 
manipulators like ourMac Pro rentals. We know how much effort it takes staying 
updated on all manner of different software and hardware, with the ability to 
jump into one of ourG5 with Kona card rentals and do your thing. Should you 
decide to take some online training to maintain and/or improve your 
professional standing and specialized skills, we would commend you for your 
work ethic &ndash; then share a few tips.</p> 
<p><strong>Always check training sources<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>You must always consider the source of online training because not all 
teachers and schools are created equal. Use your Web search skills, make some 
calls, ask questions, get references &ndash; anything to get some third-party 
insight. As you search for a source for training, you should consider the type 
of training that would work best in your specific situation. You can watch&nbsp;
live online classes, or buy books and read online class notes, or use webcams 
to interact with others, and you can study on your own or in a group.</p> 
<p><strong>Rentals for in-house training </strong></p> 
<p>If you are looking for training for a group of people, perhaps for 
professional certification of some kind, you can buy the instructional 
materials on DVD. CRE has theprojector rentals, as well as the audience 
response system rentals, that can make group training simple and effective. 
Especially in the IT and technical fields, where widely-regardedcertifications 
are essential for a tech firm&rsquo;s employees to have, using CRElaptop rentals
 rounds out a cost-effective training regimen. The more people you can get 
trained together, of course, the lower the unit cost for the preparation. 
Win-win.</p> 
<p>With large enough hardware or software purchases, vendors can also 
customize a total solution for your firm and easily integrate online or offline 
training into the plan. You don&rsquo;t need to tie up your workstations (which 
are making your company money) or budget a large hardware purchase when you use
computer rentals for training. A room of iMac rentals and/or PCs, the right 
software, the right learning materials and the right amount of time, and 
you&rsquo;ve got another group of experts in Excel, Exchange. Photoshop or 
InDesign &ndash; or Maya, C+, Logic, Pro Tools, Avid, Javascript, Ajax, Cisco, 
Microsoft, Novell or whatever else you can think of.</p> 
<p>CRE has its share of experts, too. Our Account Executives know exactly what 
solutions will fit your particular challenge, whether it&rsquo;s a 
post-production bottleneck, convention, presentation or training session.Call 
or send an e-mail, or fill out the Quick Rental Quote form, and we&rsquo;ll get 
you that personalized training solution you need.</p> 
<h1>For Computer Security, Keep Your Head in the SANS </h1> 
<h3>April 13th, 2010</h3> <br>

<p>As discussed in our&nbsp; April 8 blog (&ldquo;Computer Security, Online 
and Off&rdquo;), it wasn&rsquo;t long before the computer revolution gave rise 
to the kind of negative, destructive activity that infects all other human 
endeavors. Hackers became the new anti-heroes &ndash; they destroyed research, 
stole credit card account information, brought down communications 
infrastructure and generally made a (costly) nuisance of themselves.</p> 
<p>To combat these so-called cybercriminals, new technologies and techniques 
were developed &ndash; and are continuously updated and improved &ndash; to 
provide security for both information and the systems that store it. As the 
technologies are in a state of constant improvement,IT security professionals 
must be involved in ongoing education or risk catastrophic losses. The previous 
blog told you what expertise you needed, while this one tells you how to get it.
</p> 
<p><strong>The SANS Institute</strong></p> 
<p>Founded in 1989 to undertake collaborative research and provide state of 
the art education,SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network and Security) Institute 
oversees programs that reach some 170,000 computer and network professionals 
worldwide every year. From auditors and system operators to network 
administrators and chief information officers (CIOs), increasing numbers of IT 
professionals are sharing insights, learning lessons and finding solutions to a 
never-ending stream of security challenges.</p> 
<p>SANS brings together security professionals from a diverse array of global 
groups &ndash; including corporations, think tanks, universities, government 
agencies and trade associations &ndash; to benefit everyone concerned with 
information security. It&nbsp;is among the most trusted, and without question 
the world&rsquo;s largest, independent source for IT security training and 
professional certification. The group is a fabulous resource for everyone, from 
small TV post-production firms with CREMac Pro rentals to financial 
institutions running huge databases onIBM iSeries servers.</p> 
<p>In addition, SANS creates, maintains and distributes the most extensive set 
of research documents available regarding information security. Many of these 
valuable resources are free for the asking, including use of theInternet Storm 
Center (an &ldquo;early warning system&rdquo;), a weekly news digest called <em>
NewsBites</em>, a weekly vulnerability report entitled <em>@RISK</em> and 
timely security alerts available by RSS&nbsp; or e-mail.</p> 
<p><strong>Annual training conference</strong></p> 
<p>In San Diego, from May 7th to 15th, the group will be holding its SANS 
Security West 2010 training conference. To benefit fully from over 20 top-rated 
course offerings presented by expert instructors, make sure your show attendees 
pack our convenientlaptop rentals to take notes, stay in touch via Wi-Fi and 
download course materials.</p> 
<p>Security West 2010 is the place to be for security pros and business 
owners, and CRE can outfit you for attending, exhibiting or making a 
presentation. If you&rsquo;ve reserved a spot at the Vendor Expo, we can set 
you up withtouchscreen LCD monitor rentals, interactive kiosk rentals or 
anything else you need to present and promote your product or service.</p> 
<p><strong>Diverse and comprehensive</strong></p> 
<p>SANS veterans will recognize both classic, always-relevant offerings as 
well as exciting new courses in the comprehensive lineup. From SANS Security 
Essentials Bootcamp Style, Intrusion Detection In-Depth,Computer Forensic 
Essentials and Developing Exploits for Penetration Testers &amp; Security 
Researchers to Comprehensive Packet Analysis, Security Architecture for Systems 
Administrators andVirtualization Security Fundamentals, the course offerings 
are both diverse and comprehensive.</p> 
<p>The conference will also feature special events, a Vendor Expo/Reception 
and SANS@Night talks, all absolutely free to registered attendees. There are 
many informal yet enriching networking opportunities at SANS training events 
where you can forge valuable professional relationships that can last for 
years. That&rsquo;s the kind of relationship that CRE has with many of its 
valued clients and customers. Whether you&rsquo;re an old friend or a new one,
call or send an e-mail to our experienced Account Executives (or use the Quick 
Rental Quote form) for all of your computer, networking, storage, presentation 
and event management rental needs.</p> 
<h1>Catching a New Wave with Google </h1> 
<h3>February 25th, 2010</h3> <br>

<p>The easiest way to explain Google Wave is to call it an &ldquo;online 
collaboration platform&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Various features of chat, texting, 
e-mail, Wikis, photo-sharing, blogging and instant messaging are brought to 
bear on a &ldquo;hosted conversation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wave.&rdquo; Created by 
the Google brain trust, it is an open source product that will be integrated in 
zillions of ways with Facebook, Twitter, other Web sites and other software 
services. The software is in beta testing and will be released to the public 
sometime in 2010.</p> 
<p>Wave has the potential to be a great tool for conferences and events by 
offering a&nbsp; collaborative environment.&nbsp; The &ldquo;waves&rdquo; 
&mdash; discussions, pictures, drawings, audio notes &mdash; can be
&ldquo;threaded&rdquo; separately and can help event organizers, booth staff 
and conference attendees manage meetings, develop agendas, share content, 
capture data, record audio and video, and interact with one another in both 
planned and improvised ways.</p> 
<p><strong>Using the Wave with technology rentals<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Google Wave is, of course, a computer tool and users will need good 
internet access and the right hardware, like CRE&rsquo;s&nbsp;tablet PC rentals
, to make the most of it. With the ability to capture handwritten notes, audio 
and even video with a small, USBFlip camera, tablets are perfect for staying 
plugged-in while strolling about a convention or meeting facility.&nbsp; In a 
seated seminar,laptop rentals would integrate perfectly with your &ldquo;mobile 
tablet team,&rdquo; and your booth in the exhibit hall can be &ldquo;command 
central&rdquo; with acomputer rental.</p> 
<p>As Wave matures, it is likely that mobile applications will emerge to make 
&ldquo;waving&rdquo; (perhaps there&rsquo;s a better verb available) possible 
on cell phones, PDAs and iPads (here isour take on the iPad). During this 
process, Google will also have to address the various criticisms of Wave, which 
are to be expected in any new software product. There is a fairly stiff 
learning curve, although there are a lot ofonline tutorials from Google and 
third parties. With the plethora of options and tools, Wave can be a bit 
daunting at first glance, and there is no way to master it without jumping 
right in and devoting the time needed.</p> 
<p>When you have questions about new technology &ndash; especially tools that 
can help you work more cost-effectively &ndash; give our Account Executivesa 
call or send an e-mail. They stay abreast of all new products and services that 
can help you get your jobs done better. If you know what you need, use ourQuick 
Rental Quote form. It may take time for everyone to catch this Wave, but it 
looks like it promises to be quite a ride.</p> 
<h1>CRE Rentals, Your Co-Pilot During Pilot Season </h1> 
<h3>February 23rd, 2010</h3> <br>

<p>Those of you who read <em>Variety</em> and <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, 
not to mention all the specialty TV-biz newsletters, know that the last six 
weeks or so have seen a lot of action on theTV pilot front. ABC gave the 
greenlight to two dramas and a comedy in one day, with Fox, NBC and CBS 
spreading out their action over a bit more calendar space. Fact is, though, 
that the pilot season is in full swing, which means companies great and small 
will be doing title sequences, post-processing, digital effects and other work 
for the producers of the shows. CRE, of course, specializes in supporting the
entertainment industry with the best computers and other high-tech equipment.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It was not that long ago that it took a room full of computing power to 
produce a single four-minute cartoon. Now there are independent films being 
created on single Macintoshes. Even the17-inch iMac, for example, has a Core 2 
Duo processor and a gigabyte of RAM, an unthinkably powerful combination that 
would have seemed otherworldly in the 2001 TV season (remember<em>The Lone 
Gunmen</em>?). It is muscular enough for audio/video chores and provides a 
potent platform forAdobe&rsquo;s Creative Suite, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Technology rentals for the&nbsp; entertainment industry<br>

</strong></p> 
<p>Running hither and yon to meetings, day and night? If you take along one of 
theCRE laptop rentals, like the HP NX9010 with a 3GHz Pentium, you will power 
your way through them all. You will be in constant contact with its WiFi, and 
the 1GB of RAM will keep you multitasking with notes, video clips, audio 
addenda and everything else that is likely to come up. Staying put at your 
desk? Offload your extra work to your assistant or pilot-season temp, outfitted 
with an HP/Compaq D510, adesktop rentals star with a 2.4GHz Pentium 4. This 
rental package comes with a17-inch LCD monitor, too.</p> 
<p>CRE covers you no matter what your production needs. From&nbsp;30&Prime; 
Apple Cinema Display rental for a big-screen work window, to powerful video and 
post solutions like the PowerMacG5 with Kona card rentals, we have it all. No 
matter what you have to do, we have the equipment to help you get it done, and 
everything arrives to you tested, double-checked and ready to rock, every time. 
Even more, we can provide theoffice equipment rentals to tie everything 
together &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s an HP 4000N B&amp;W laser printer or an 
all-in-one printer/fax/scanner. CRE has got you covered.</p> 
<p>Need some help configuring a system or figuring out a solution for your 
pilot season workload? Our Account Executives know what you need and have been 
helping entertainment industry professionals of all kinds for a long, long 
time. We know what you&rsquo;re up against, and we know how to help.Contact us

<h1>Five Technologies to Watch in 2010 &ndash; CRE Rentals </h1> 
<h3>January 15th, 2010</h3> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Anything that affects your firm&rsquo;s long-term plans and ongoing 
operations is called &ldquo;a strategic consideration,&rdquo; like the 2009 
buzz phrase &ldquo;going mobile.&rdquo; New technologies always fit that 
description. No matter what industry you are in, you must start factoring new 
technologies into your strategic planning now. You must determine how to 
approach each of the top five new business technologies for 2010 that are 
presented here (in no particular order). We start with a &ldquo;big buzz 
holdover&rdquo; from 2009.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Cloud computing</strong></p> 
<p>Here it is again, waiting to be crowned As Important As The Wheel, which 
proponents insist will occur any day now. It does look promising, ascloud 
computing promises to deliver a huge menu of IT options to cost-conscious 
companies (and everyone else, eventually). Fact is, with anXServe rental from 
CRE you could create a cloud or two of your own, as well as educate your 
employees on the change that&rsquo;s &ldquo;right around the corner.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>2. Client computing</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Virtualization&rdquo; means using computing applications in such a 
way that hardware and operating system (OS) considerations are not 
deal-killers. Companies need to look at everything from device specifications, 
ownership/support of hardware and&nbsp;software&nbsp;selection to management 
structure and security. Getting a powerfuldesktop rental can help you discover 
the difference between running your current, aging hardware and the new 
generations of Macintosh and PC computers, especially in terms of the new 
Internet standards heading your way.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Flash memory</strong></p> 
<p>Flash memory is increasingly important for storage solutions. The kind of 
semiconductor memory device found in USB &ldquo;thumb drives&rdquo; and digital 
camera cards, flash memory is smaller, sturdier and faster than hard drives. 
Flash memory will come to dominateembedded systems, personal electronics and 
mass storage, andlaptop rentals will include units with solid-state flash 
memory soon after they hit the market. Flash memory provides advantages in 
space, heat resistance, power consumption, ruggedness and speed.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Advanced analytics</strong></p> 
<p>A variety of analytical tools help companies investigate alternative 
scenarios and manufacturing/marketing outcomes. Fixed rules and inflexible 
policies are being replaced by informed decision-making based on &ldquo;the 
right information at the right time.&rdquo; Since advanced analytics provide 
overlapping, real-time alternatives and predictions, not just dry data, it may 
take a widescreenLCD monitor rental to keep everything in front of you at once 
while you make some very important decisions.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Mobile applications</strong></p> 
<p>Some 1.2 billion people around the world will be using devices capable of 
truly interactive, mobile commerce by the end of 2010. In an environment where 
mobility is converging with wireless and the Web, a huge number of new 
applications will pop up. There are already almost 100,000 programs for the 
Apple iPhone and Google-ized Droid, even with the high prices and unique coding 
for each device. Newer software programs will operate on both mobile computers, 
liketablet PC rentals, as well as a range of mobile systems &ndash; netbooks, 
phones, PDAs and even portable media players.</p> 
<p>Did we miss any technologies that should be watched? We&rsquo;d love to 
hear from you.</p> 
<h1>CRE Looks at &ldquo;The Year of the Netbook&rdquo; </h1> 
<h3>January 12th, 2010</h3> <br>

<p>The only thing constant is change, right? This past year proved that the 
computer industry still had product niches left to develop and exploit. The 
rise of the &ldquo;netbook&rdquo; &ndash; a low- to medium-power, small-format 
computer with a bright screen, built-in WiFi, and basic productivity software 
that will never be confused for a rootin&rsquo; tootin&rsquo; laptop, like the 
newMacBook rental &ndash; proves the computer companies are still thinking 
about their product lines (and bottom lines, of course).</p> 
<p>The move to &ldquo;pocket computers&rdquo; follows the trend to 
smartphones, of which the iPhone and the newGoogle-powered Droid are prime 
examples. The phones are truly pocket-sized, can run tons of &ldquo;apps&rdquo; 
that are easily downloaded for low or no cost, and are great for quick messages 
as well as long talks. The netbooks, most with keyboards between 60-80% the 
size of a normal PC laptop, offer real e-mail interaction, a normal Web 
experience with a real browser, memory card slots, USB ports, Ethernet &mdash; 
wow, just like a real computer!</p> 
<p><strong>Critical mass for netbooks<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Interestingly, it was the niche players &mdash; companies like Acer and 
Asus that were more business- than consumer-oriented, and also sold 
motherboards and other components &mdash; that drove the development of 
netbooks. Soon enough, major players like Dell, Lenovo, Toshiba and 
Hewlett-Packard which makes everything from netbooks to high-powerdesktops 
(available as a rental), were in the game.</p> 
<p>You won&rsquo;t be doing Vegas Video editing on a netbook, and forget Final 
Cut Pro as Apple, despitepersistent rumors, has steadfastly refused to enter 
the fray with a &ldquo;Mac netbook.&rdquo; The processors, although Intel, 
aren&rsquo;t quad-core, dual-core or even hard-core (like some tried-and-true 
Pentiums). More powerful CPUs will not be possible until better battery 
technology is available, and dissipating heat is always a problem in small 
spaces where fans don&rsquo;t fit.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Phone-replacement&rdquo; computers?</strong></p> 
<p>Businesses may find a use for netbooks as smartphone replacements, but they 
are simply not fast enough, and the screens are too small, to be true laptop 
replacements. If you need apowerful HP or Mac laptop in your line of work, an 
Atom-powered HP Mini is just not going to cut it. In fact, if you need a few 
laptops for your department to stay in touch at a conference, take notes, send 
e-mails and browse prospects&rsquo; (or competitors&rsquo;) sites, you&rsquo;d 
be pushing a poor little netbook into a nervous breakdown.</p> 
<p>As always, &nbsp;get the right tool for the job. If you need help figuring

<h1>Reviews of Computer &amp; Technology News of 2009 </h1> 
<h3>December 29th, 2009</h3> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>This past year, for computer lovers, was as good as it gets. While every 
year sees new inventions and further refinements of existing products, 2009 was 
a landmark year in many ways. From thenew MacBook models that CRE now rents to 
new display technology and &ldquo;wireless everything,&rdquo; 2009 was a big 
year.</p> 
<p>Laptops have gotten more powerful while getting lighter. Leaving aside the 
new netbooks, subject of a future blog, the laptop sector has made big strides 
in power, heat dissipation, battery life, displays, and connectivity. The year 
started off with dual-core processors limited to theMacBook Pro laptop rental 
and PCs, and ended with quad-core processors available at the high end of some 
lines.</p> 
<p>Desktops have changed in terms of power and ports. Apple dropped the 
original FireWire 400 connector for FireWire 800 (backward compatible with an 
adapter). USB is king of the hill for connections, with USB 3.0 right around 
the corner promising another serious speed bump. Ethernet? Faster. Phone 
modems? Disappearing. Hard drive capacities are into the terabyte (TB) range 
and no one gets a PC with just &ldquo;a gig of RAM&rdquo; anymore. Even low-end 
PCs now come with 2-4GB of RAM. Powerhouses likeCRE&rsquo;s quad- and 
eight-core HP computer rental can have up to 32GB.</p> 
<p><strong>LCD Displays &ndash; Seeing is believing<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Computer users can thank display manufacturers for their less-strained 
eyes. The LCD and LED-backlit monitors look better, use less power and emit 
less radiation.Plasma monitor (rentals) are still tops in the largest sizes, 
while the Apple Cinema Display 24-inch LED monitor is what every 
post-production pro wants under the tree this year.</p> 
<p><strong>Look, Mom, no wires on technology rentals<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, it was a &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; year, for sure, and not just in terms 
of Web browsing at the coffee shop. The mouse, your phone, the printer, your TV 
&ndash; everything is hooking up with everything else by radio, Bluetooth, WiFi 
and (it seems) smoke signals, too. It&rsquo;s not just&nbsp;tablet PC rentals 
that provide portability with connectivity. Your phone, its headset and your 
office all-in-one have all lost their electronic umbilical cords. This coming 
year, watch for wireless recharging of these devices.</p> 
<p>If you want to know what else to watch for in 2010, keep checking our blog. 
We will&nbsp; feature tech trends in 2010, laptop and desktop guides, a netbook 
report, gadget updates and other problem-solving, trend-spotting news. In the 
meantime, when you&rsquo;ve got work backed up and no time to waste, remember 
that CRE is here to solve your problems with just the right tools.&nbsp;Contact
