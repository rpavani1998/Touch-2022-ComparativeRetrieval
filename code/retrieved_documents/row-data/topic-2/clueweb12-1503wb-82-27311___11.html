<h2>3 Methods of Linux System Administration and Why Linux Commands Are Best 
&ndash; Linux Training Online</h2>  Sunday, November 13th, 2011 | Learn Linux - 
Linux help | No Comments <br>
<br>

<p>By Clyde E. Boom</p> 
<p>When you are a new user needing to get Linux training, it is often 
confusing to decide what to focus on.</p> 
<p>Should you learn how to use Linux for just one distribution (a.k.a. 
version, distro)?</p> 
<p>Should you focus on learning GUI utilities &ndash; or should you learn 
Linux commands for doing system administration?</p> 
<p><strong>Linux Commands Training Tips:</strong> The Linux System 
Administration concepts and commands covered here apply to ALL Linux distros, 
including: Red Hat, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Slackware, Debian, Fedora, SUSE 
and openSUSE.</p> 
<p><strong>3 Methods of Linux System Administration and Why Using Linux 
Commands is the Best Method</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1. Using Linux GUI utilities for System Administration</strong></p> 
<p>Many Linux distributions have &ldquo;point-and-click&rdquo; GUI (graphical 
user interface) utilities that allow you to do common and popular tasks, like 
manage the file system, create Linux users, and manage user and group 
permissions.</p> 
<p>However, these GUI utilities are usually specific to a single Linux 
distribution.</p> 
<p>So, learning how to use a Linux GUI in one distro is basically useless if 
you have to use a different one later, or if you&rsquo;re working in an 
environment with multiple Linux distributions.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> <em><strong>Linux Training Tips:</strong> To run a GUI utility, you need 
to have a desktop installed and sometimes one isn&rsquo;t installed on a Linux 
server because it isn&rsquo;t needed. In addition to this, the Linux system 
administration pros only use commands because GUI utilities are too slow to run 
and time-consuming to use.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>2. Doing Linux System Administration Tasks with Commands that are 
Specific to a Distribution</strong></p> 
<p>The major (popular) Linux distributions all have several commands that are 
specific to that single distribution. In other words, for each popular distro, 
there are several commands that are specific that just that version.</p> 
<p>For example, a Linux distribution will likely have a command that is used 
to manage partitions (disk space) and this command is specific to that 
distribution.</p> 
<p>Learning how to use commands that are only available on a single 
distribution is a huge waste of time &ndash; if there is an equivalent GNU / 
Linux command &ndash; and there almost always is.</p> 
<p>For example, the Linux fdisk command is a GNU command that is used to 
manage the partitions on a system and this command exists on all distributions.
</p> 
<p>So, rather than learn a command that is specific to a single Linux 
distribution, learn the GNU commands because these commands are common to all 
distributions.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Using Linux Commands that are Common to All Distributions 
&ndash; The GNU Commands</strong></p> 
<p>The GNU commands are the most popular Linux commands &ndash; and they are 
common to all distributions.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> <em><strong>Linux Training Tips:</strong> Linux distributions are rising 
and falling in popularity all the time.</em></p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>If you just learn how to use Linux by running the GUI utilities in one 
distro, and then you stop using that distro, then you have to learn all the GUI 
utilities of the next distro. If you learn how to use commands, then you learn 
how to use Linux for all distros!</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>How can you tell which commands are the GNU / Linux commands?
</strong></p> 
<p>Get an excellent set of videos that shows you the popular GNU commands and 
then try these Linux commands yourself. Then you can learn Linux the easy way 
&ndash; by watching it and then working with it!</p> 
<p>And now I would like to offer you free access to my Linux Commands Training 
Mini-Course, a 7 Lesson, Daily Mini-Course, including the free Linux Commands 
ebook and Linux audio podcasts &ndash; showing you how to get started learning

<h2>Learn How To Install Software In Linux and Unix Distros</h2>  Friday,

<p>Learn How To Install Software In Linux and Unix Distros</p> 
<p>By Eddison Sherry</p> 
<p>For a Linux enthusiast there are a variety of distributions (distros) or 
otherwise called flavors available in the internet. These distros vary mostly 
in the package management system they use to install software and also in their 
philosophy. Although the basis is same, it is the differences in handling the 
power that the kernel (Core program of the operating system) delivers that 
makes them distinct from each other. A newbie can easily get confused with the 
concepts in Linux, thanks to Microsoft which serves as an introductory course 
to using a computer the way you want it. In this article we will check what all 
options are catered for a normal user in installing software.</p> 
<p>Mainly the distros can be categorized on the basis of package management 
system into three viz, .rpm based (redhat package manager), .deb based and the 
source based. The first category.rpm has its basis on Red Hat operating system 
or extensive usage of their code. openSUSE, fedora, Mandriva are a few to 
mention in this class.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The next class is.deb or Debian based distros. Multitude of distros are 
available in this too most prominent one being Ubuntu.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The third category uses the source code for its primary operations Gentoo 
linux being one among them. Many distros provide additional front end programs 
to make it easier for the user to add or remove libraries or software&rsquo;s 
to the system which may be either GUI based or command based.</p> 
<p>Now we will have a look at a few conceptually best package managers used by 
the distros. Red Hat has Yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) package manager for 
the convenience of the user. It was originally developed to manage Red Hat 
Linux systems at Duke University&rsquo;s Physics department.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu has the synaptic package manager which uses the underlying 
apt(Advanced Packaging Tool) to gather and install software. Gentoo uses 
portage as its software installer but is a bit different in behavior from other 
package managers in that it deals with source code and compiles and installs 
for the specific machine on which it is running. These package managers install 
software from any recorded media like CD or DVD or from internet servers called 
repositories maintained by distributions and communities associated with its 
development. All these software managers resolve dependencies between packages 
while installing a software or library. Dependencies arise when a software 
might be compatible with a particular implementation of a library file where as 
another software we are trying to install might need a different underlying 
implementation of the same concept. When the two such conflicting 
software&rsquo;s needs to coexist then the library file preferences need to be 
sorted out. Software&rsquo;s usually depend on many libraries and hence the 
automatic management of dependencies is a welcome move as far as the huge Linux 
users community across the globe is considered as it would alleviate the 
problems in managing the system.</p> 
<p>There is ample scope if you are a nerd or a geek to have your own way of 
tweaking the system and this is what fancies the computer addicts to use this 
powerful operating system. To conclude let us assume that the competition in 
the field gives rise to wonderful Linux based operating systems easily 
manageable and gives a new dimension to computing capabilities of the new 
generation.</p> 
<p>Eddison Sherry had been working in Linux and other Unix flavours for long 
years. He had been writing blogs and article on the Linux Storage,Linux Commands
 and Linux Server Administration. If you are working on Linux or Unix Server 
its best to have a look on his blogs atLinux Technical Forum.</p>  Tags: debian,

<h2>2011 Best Linux Distributions</h2>  Thursday, February 10th, 2011 | Learn 
Linux - Linux help | 10 Comments <br>
<br>

<p>2011 Best Linux Distributions</p> 
<p>By Judith Ceja</p> 
<p>Which Linux distribution is right for you? There is no one right answer 
because it depends on your experience and specific needs. Listed below are the 
top seven Linux operating systems for 2011. Each program was ranked based on 
ease of installation, user-friendliness, and amount of support available.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions for desktops. New 
versions are released about every six months. This program is easy to install 
and use. The ample support comes from both technical professionals as well as 
end users. Ubuntu is a great program for beginners</p> 
<p>Mandriva originally appeared to be a restructured version of Red Hat Linux. 
The current software has added user-friendly features including better hardware 
detection and intuitive disk partitioning. Mandriva also utilizes a KDE desktop 
and has great support which makes it a good program for beginners.</p> 
<p>PCLinuxOS is great for new Linux users due to its intuitive graphical 
installer. It provides users with current desktop software and fast boot times. 
This program received our lowest rating for support because it does not provide 
support in any language other than English. Additionally, the program is only 
available in a 32-bit version and new releases are not scheduled regularly.</p> 
<p>Gentoo was designed for power users, allowing them to have ultimate 
customization capabilities. It also has exceptional security. One of its best 
features is the ability to keep the system current without re-installing the 
software. However, long compilation times and occasionally instability makes it 
less of a crowd pleaser than other available software.</p> 
<p>OpenSUSE has an extensive and intuitive configuration tool. The program 
also includes user-friendly desktop environments (GNOME and KDE). The program 
gets high marks for help and support. However, its heavy use of resources for 
desktop setup and graphical utilities tend to slow the program down.</p> 
<p>Debian GNU/Linux supports more infrastructures than any other Linux 
distribution program and contains more than 20,000 software packages. It has 
become the largest Linux distribution ever created and has inspired over 120 
Debian-based distributions. The program has a reputation for stability and 
being the most bug-free Linux distribution system on the market. However, their 
intensive testing has led to lengthy intervals between releases, typically 1-3 
years.</p> 
<p>FreeBSD was introduced into the market in 1993. The program is not in the 
same league as the other programs listed. However, it is fast, stable and has 
over 15,000 software applications available. FreeBSD lacks a graphical 
installer and the convenient features of hardware detection and system 
configuration which must be performed manually by the user.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, you must choose the program that is right for you. Ubuntu and 
PCLinuxOS enable beginners to use Linux without requiring a steep learning 
curve to produce results. Gentoo and FreeBSD are definitely for more advanced 
users. Mandriva, Debian GNU/Linux, and openSUSE are the best programs if you 
are willing to trade some advanced features for stability and continuing 
support.</p>

<h2>Running Commands at Startup in Debian and Ubuntu &ndash; The Simplest 
Approach</h2>  Thursday, April 1st, 2010 | Learn Linux - Linux help | 6 Comments
<br> <br>

<p>Running Commands at Startup in Debian and Ubuntu &ndash; The Simplest 
Approach</p> 
<p>By Austin White</p> 
<p>Running custom scripts on startup is a common operation in the Linux 
community. In my case, when the machine hosting my website needs to be rebooted 
or even crashes, it is critical that the backend processes that the website 
depends on start correctly. For other Linux or BSD users, it can be useful to 
start up useful background processes, perhaps servers for accessing your 
machine remotely.</p> 
<p><strong>The Classic Method for Running Processes at Startup</strong></p> 
<p>The most documented way of starting processes when the machine boots is to 
add a control script to /etc/init.d. This script must take an argument that can 
be one of &ldquo;stop,&rdquo; &ldquo;start,&rdquo; and &ldquo;restart.&rdquo; 
An example of such a script would be /etc/init.d/ssh, which is used to start 
and stop the ssh server. When a machine shuts down, it is important for many 
daemons to clean up their pid files and otherwise shut down nicely. However, 
for user-run processes, simply being sent SIGTERM as part of normal shutdown is 
sufficient.</p> 
<p>Here is an example of a script that is used only for starting a process.</p>
<pre>$ cat /etc/init.d/boot_server #!/bin/sh -e case &quot;$1&quot; in start) 
/home/prod/start_server.sh ;; stop) ;; reload|restart|force-reload) 
/home/prod/start_server.sh ;; *) echo &quot;Usage: [this] 
{start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload}&quot; &gt;&amp;2 exit 1 ;; esac exit 0
</pre> 
<p>To ensure that daemons are started and stopped, particularly in the correct 
order, the machine runs special symlinks to these scripts. The symlinks have 
special names that either begin with an<em>S</em> or a <em>K</em>. For example, 
my machine has /etc/rc3.d/S20lighttpd and /etc/rc0.d/K20lighttpd. (The numbers 
in the rc directory names are known as runlevels. A discussion of runlevels is 
beyond the scope of this article, and if you wish to know more, there are a 
number of good resources on the internet.) Scripts beginning with<em>S</em> are 
used to start a process during bootup. Those beginning with<em>K</em> are used 
to kill a process during shutdown. The number in the link name is used to 
determine the order in which these processes are started and killed.</p> 
<p>Thus, to run a process at startup on your Linux machine, you would need to 
both add a script to /etc/init.d that takes &ldquo;start&rdquo; as an argument, 
and you would want to add symlinks to your script to the /etc/rc*.d 
directories. Your scripts have to follow the naming convention described above, 
probably starting with S99 or S98 to ensure that your processes start after all 
the important system daemons. The<em>K</em> symlink is unnecessary.</p> 
<p><strong>Using /etc/rc.local &ndash; A Better Way to Start Processes on 
Debian and Ubuntu</strong></p> 
<p>Instead of adding a startup script and the related symlinks, a much easier 
approach is to add your commands to the bash script /etc/rc.local. A quick look 
at /etc/rc.local demonstrates that it is rather self-explanatory.</p> 
<pre>$ cat /etc/rc.local #!/bin/sh -e # # rc.local # # This script is executed 
at the end of each multiuser runlevel. # Make sure that the script will 
&quot;exit 0&quot; on success or any other # value on error. # # In order to 
enable or disable this script just change the execution # bits. # # By default 
this script does nothing. exit 0</pre> 
<p>At the end of /etc/rc.local, but before the <em>exit 0</em> line, I can 
simply add a call to my server startup script:</p> 
<pre># Run website processes /home/prod/start_server.sh</pre> 
<p>It is a one-line change, instead of adding an overly complicated script and 
the related symlinks. Of course, this is not an option if you require 
additional commands to be run at shutdown. In addition, if you need your 
process to be started before some other system process, you must resort to the 
classic startup script as discussed above. /etc/rc.local almost the last script 
to be run as part of the boot process.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion: Use /etc/rc.local to Run Processes at Startup in Linux
</strong></p> 
<p>Classic startup scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc*.d are appropriate for 
many daemons and some more complicated user processes that must either start 
before a system process or be cleaned up during shutdown. However, 
/etc/rc.local is preferred for all other cases. It is a simple bash script you 
can edit as root on your machine.</p>

<h2>Are You Getting Sick Of Microsoft Windows? It&rsquo;s Time To Give Ubuntu 
Linux A Whirl</h2>  Monday, November 9th, 2009 | Learn Linux - Linux help | 1 
Comment <br>
<br>

<p>Are You Getting Sick Of Microsoft Windows? It&rsquo;s Time To Give Ubuntu 
Linux A Whirl<br>
 By Alan Oliver</p> 
<p>About 18 months ago, I had another disastrous crash on my PC that caused me 
to lose a host of photos, music and documents. Luckily I had a backup of most 
of my documents on an external disk. So I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned by this. I 
had experienced many crashes on Windows before and usually I was able to 
recover most of my documents and restore the system back to normal without too 
much effort.</p> 
<p>This time was different however and to my horror, I discovered that Windows 
had somehow corrupted my external disk as well. I had lost everything and was 
pretty angry about it.</p> 
<p>I tried a number of data recovery programs but most of the files wore gone. 
Forever. What a disaster! At that point I decided that I would look for another 
alternative to windows and I thought I would give Linux another try.</p> 
<p>A few years earlier I had experimented with RedHat Linux but had no real 
success with it as it had problems detecting my usb keyboard and mouse. Which 
was obviously a bit of a non-starter for me. I knew that big advances were 
being made in the Linux world so I decided to do a bit of research.</p> 
<p>Linux is an operating system that is free. That is, it can be downloaded 
and copied and distributed without a fee. It is free in a deeper sense too. 
Most of the software is written under a license called the &ldquo;GPL&rdquo; 
which effectively means that source code is available to everyone for each and 
every component of the Linux Operating System. If you have access to the source 
code for a piece of software then you can change the program to fix bugs and 
make it better. Once you do this you are under obligation to make your new 
source code available to others.<br>
 This has worked extremely well and Linux 
is being developed by programmers all over the world to make it better and 
better. The progress is amazing!</p> 
<p>In my research I discovered a website: distrowatch.com. This website keeps 
a list of the most popular distributions of Linux. A distribution is a 
collection of Linux software that together makes an operating system. Each 
distribution contains different software and has a different focus. There are 
so many to try&hellip; Fedora, Mandrake, Puppy, PCLinuxOS, Debian, Knoppix, and 
the most popular, Ubuntu Linux.</p> 
<p>I downloaded the ISO of Ubuntu Linux from the Ubuntu website 
http://www.ubuntu.com/ and burned it to cd (an ISO file is cd image that can be 
recreated using a cd burning tool such as Nero). I placed the cd in my drive 
and booted up my computer.</p> 
<p>I was astounded!</p> 
<p>Within 10 minutes my computer was running Ubuntu Linux without even having 
to install it! This was a &ldquo;Live-CD&rdquo; and it can be used without 
installing to hard disk &ndash; it can be run from a cd without affecting your 
computer at all.</p> 
<p>All my hardware was detected and within minutes I was surfing the web using 
Firefox and getting my email using Evolution, chatting to friends in messenger 
and yahoo chat using Gaim, writing documents and opening spreadsheets in Open 
Office and listening to Internet Radio with RythmBox.</p> 
<p>I was delighted with the easy to use and gorgeous looking desktop. I 
decided to install it straight away and since then I haven&rsquo;t looked back.
</p> 
<p>There is an abundance of free open source software just waiting for you to 
experience. The package management system &ndash; Synaptic, allows you to 
search repositories of software and download them. The quality of a lot of the 
software is incredible.</p> 
<p>Linux is written from the ground up to be a secure operating system. This 
means that you won&rsquo;t have to worry about getting viruses, spyware or any 
other kind of malware. My system is as stable as a rock.<br>
 Of course, there 
are downsides to running Linux. The main one is that there is a learning curve 
that can be quite steep. It is not windows so If you are trying to get 
something working, your windows knowledge will not help you.<br>
 You might 
need to troubleshoot problems using the Command Line Interface &ndash; similar 
to windows DOS, but many times more powerful.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, help is at hand on the incredibly friendly and helpful forums 
at ubuntuforums.org<br>
 I have been running Ubuntu Linux now for 18 months and 
can&rsquo;t see any reason now to return to windows. Once you get past the mind 
set of using closed source software a whole new world opens up before you and 
you realise that amazing things are possible with linux.</p>

Ubuntu Linux as I did. You won&rsquo;t regret trying it.</p>

<h2>Getting Started With Ubuntu &ndash; How To Connect To The Internet And Do 
Common Window Tasks</h2>  Monday, November 2nd, 2009 | Learn Linux - Linux help

<p>Getting Started With Ubuntu &ndash; How To Connect To The Internet And Do 
Common Window Tasks<br>
 By David Babble</p> 
<p>Download the latest version of Ubuntu from their official site and burn the 
downloaded ISO file to a blank CD. Any good CD burning software should be able 
to handle writing ISO files to a disc.</p> 
<p>When the CD finishes remove it and put it back into the drive so it auto 
plays and followed the instructions to boot into the Live CD. Live CD allows 
you to temporarily run Ubuntu and most of its features without doing anything 
to your installation of Windows. This is a good chance to see if you really 
like what Ubuntu has to offer before really committing.</p> 
<p>After playing around in Ubuntu&rsquo;s environment for a bit you&rsquo;ll 
notice an examples folder on the desktop that has various types of files that 
can be opened using Ubuntu&rsquo;s default programs installed. For example, 
Ubuntu will use Open Office (a free alternative to Microsoft Office) to open 
DOC files.</p> 
<p>Connecting to the Internet in Ubuntu</p> 
<p>There was no obvious signs of how to connect to the Internet. After looking 
around the help pages built into the operating system you&rsquo;ll notice that 
connecting to the Internet is pretty simple, unless you have a USB ADSL modem. 
Being on an Orange broadband basic package means a USB ADSL modem has to be 
used unless you own a router separately.</p> 
<p>Being on the basic package means connecting to the Internet using a USB 
modem, not an Ethernet Live box that Orange provides on the upgraded package. 
So rebooting the computer and finding a web page came up with the instructions 
to extract some firmware, write a boot script etc. just to get the modem to 
connect.</p> 
<p>After completing the modem installation in the Ubuntu&rsquo;s Live CD 
environment you&rsquo;ll be prompted to restart Ubuntu to get started. 
Restarting Ubuntu whilst using Live CD will just restart into Windows, so 
that&rsquo;s no good!</p> 
<p>There had to be another answer. At this point I got fed up and went back to 
Windows. A few months later I plucked up the courage to try Ubuntu again but 
the Internet connection issue was still stick in my mind. So I searched around 
on Google more and searched the Ubuntu Forums. This is when I came across some 
luck. I found a thread in a forum thread where a guy made a USB ADSL modem 
manager program!</p> 
<p>Was this going to end the problem? I thought. So after checking out the USB 
Modem Manager site and then following the link to the latest version, I 
downloaded the Debian file for it, .DEB. First thought was, being used to 
Windows, what the hell do I do with a Debian file? Is it a Ubuntu version of a 
Windows zip file or what?</p> 
<p>I double clicked the Debian file downloaded to my desktop and voil&agrave;, 
it started to install the modem manager, great, must be just Ubuntu&rsquo;s 
version of a windows .EXE file. The program prompted me to unplug and plug my 
modem back in and it still didn&rsquo;t work. So after a couple of times of 
re-extracting the firmware, disconnecting and reconnecting using the options in 
the manager, the progress bar for the Internet connection located in the top 
right went fully green, it must&rsquo;ve worked.</p> 
<p>I opened Firefox, typed in a URL and hey presto, the Internet worked. 
Fortunately, this USB modem manager doesn&rsquo;t require a restart so 
it&rsquo;s possible to run and test the Internet while using the Live CD, which 
I highly recommend doing.</p> 
<p>Taking the Plunge with Ubuntu</p> 
<p>With this caveat fixed, I took the plunge, backed up all my files onto an 
external hard drive and fully installed Ubuntu over Windows.</p> 
<p>After trying it for just over 24 hours I became convinced that this was an 
operating system that I would be using for the long term. I can copy large 
amounts of files from one hard drive to the other without my PC noticeably 
slowing or making music stutter, file transfers are seamless whilst doing other 
tasks.</p> 
<p>I tried opening a video file and Ubuntu complained that it couldn&rsquo;t 
play that type of file, but it promptly came up with a message telling me I can 
download the required files to get it to work, so a click of the OK button and 
it was fixed. I tried playing an MP3 and the same happened, just a click of a 
message and Ubuntu located and installed the required files to play my music. 
These files need to be downloaded separately due to propriety issues.</p> 
<p>A few things take a while to get used to, such as the folder views it has 
and the prompts that come up occasionally requesting your password to be 
entered. This might seem odd to have to enter a password just to change the 
date/time. With Windows latest operating system, Vista, prompting for requests 
on more admin type tasks, the odd one or two from Ubuntu are manageable.</p> 
<p>Playing Video Games and other Windows Software in Ubuntu</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t play games much and haven&rsquo;t attempted to do so yet, but 
I&rsquo;ll try WINE sometime and see if that works. WINE is a program to let 
you play Windows only software in Ubuntu. Could come in handy for Photoshop 
since the free equivalent, GIMP, just doesn&rsquo;t cut it for some things I 
want to do, such as batch image processing.</p> 
<p>Ubuntu is a flavour of Linux that is becoming a popular, free alternative 
to Windows. To get started, go to the Ubuntu site.</p> 
<p>Conclusion</p> 
<p>Hopefully this guide will help the average computer user out there decide 
whether they really want to take the plunge with a different, but free 
operating system. In summary, if you&rsquo;re prepared to spend a few hours to 
get used to it and to get it working the way you want, go for it!</p>

<p>Debian Chinese How-To<br>
 By Yien Bin</p> 
<p>This is my personal experience with chinese environment setup on my Debian 
Box, with KDE desktop.</p> 
<p>Here is my specs.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Debian Unstable, kernel 2.6.18-1-686</li> 
<li>xserver-xorg 7.1.0-4</li> 
<li>kde 3.5.5</li> </ul> 
<p>Setting your system with english locales, so that your desktop, menus and 
programs&rsquo; file menus won&rsquo;t show english characters in blurry 
chinese ttf fonts. You will still have the ability to input chinese in almost 
everything(browsers, konquerer, instant messengers, konsole, xchat and more).
<br> Here is a step by step instruction.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Setting UTF-8 Locale system wide</strong><br>

<blockquote> 
<p>dpkg-reconfigure locales</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This command will prompt you a screen to select your desired locales. For 
my case, I have selected</p> 
<ol> 
<li>en_US ISO-8859-1</li> 
<li>en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8</li> 
<li>zh_CN GB2312</li> 
<li>zh_CN.GB18030 GB18030</li> 
<li>zh_CN.GB18030 GB18030</li> 
<li>zh_CN.GB18030 GB18030</li> 
<li>zh_TW BIG5</li> 
<li>zh_TW.UTF-8 UTF-8</li> </ol> 
<p>Set <strong>en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8</strong> as default locales. By now, when you 
output your locales settings with<strong>locale</strong> command, all the 
variables with &ldquo;<strong>LC_XXX</strong>&rdquo; shoud be already in &ldquo;
<strong>en_US.UTF-8</strong>&ldquo;.</p> 
<p></p></li> 
<li><strong>Displaying Chinese</strong> 
<p>There are a few packages you need to get in order to get chinese text 
displayed correctly in your KDE desktop.<br>
 These are for KDE 
Internationalization.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>kde-i18n-zhcn (for Simplified Chinese)</li> 
<li>kde-i18n-zhtw (for Big5 Chinese)</li> </ul> 
<p>You can always add your desired encoding for other languages. I have also 
kde-i18n-ko for korean, and kde-i18n-ja for Japan.<br>
 After installing the 
internationalized packages, you will have to install TTF(true type fonts). 
Here&rsquo;s the list.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>ttf-arphic-bkai00mp (&ldquo;AR PL KaitiM Big5&Prime; Chinese TrueType font)
</li> 
<li>ttf-arphic-bsmi00lp (&ldquo;AR PL Mingti2L Big5&Prime; Chinese TrueType 
font)</li> 
<li>ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp (&ldquo;AR PL SungtiL GB&rdquo; Chinese TrueType font)
</li> 
<li>ttf-arphic-gkai00mp (&ldquo;AR PL KaitiM GB&rdquo; Chinese TrueType font)
</li> 
<li>ttf-arphic-uming (&ldquo;AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni&rdquo; Chinese Unicode 
TrueType font)</li> 
<li>ttf-fireflysung (&ldquo;AR PL New Sung&rdquo; Chinese TrueType font)</li> 
<li>ttf-kochi-gothic-naga10 (Kochi Subst Gothic Japanese TrueType font)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>My default chinese font is ttf-fireflysung which I&rsquo;ve forgot where to 
get. I remember getting it from a Taiwan site, if any of you have the address, 
please kindly let me know. If you are unable to get firefly, uming is probably 
your best choice for chinese text.</p></li> 
<li><strong>Changing font for chinese text display</strong> 
<p>Sometimes in your KDE desktop, if you have downloaded files with 
chinese/japanese file names, it will be displayed in square unreadable 
characters. This means KDE is unable to find appropriate font substitution for 
unknown characters. You can get<strong>qt3-qtconfig</strong> to deal with this 
problem. Inside the program you will get to set font substitution for your 
default KDE font(mine is Bitstream Vera). Apply several substitution TTFs like 
AR PL New Sung and AR PL ShanHeiSun Uni, so your text will be displayed 
correctly.</p> 
<p>For other programs like Firefox, Xchat, amarok and more. You will get to 
choose their own default font. For my case, once qt3-qtconfig is set properly, 
these programs have no problem using the settings.</p> 
<p>If above methods still do not work out for you. You can try also install 
<strong>gtk2-engines-gtk-qt</strong>. This program will use your Qt settings to 
draw your GTK applications&rsquo; user interface, including the fonts of 
course. You should also check with</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>update-alternatives &ndash;config qtconfig</p> </blockquote> 
<p>to see whether which qt config is currently in use. If you have used 
qt3-qtconfig, you definitely should choose &ldquo;/usr/bin/qtconfig-qt3&Prime; 
as your default.</p></li> 
<li><strong>Chinese Input Method</strong> 
<p>IMO, scim is always the best choice because it has pinyin support, the only 
chinese input method I&rsquo;m familiar with. You will have to get these 
packages.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>scim</li> 
<li>scim-chinese</li> 
<li>scim-gtk2-immodule</li> 
<li>scim-modules-socket</li> 
<li>scim-pinyin</li> 
<li>libscim8c2a</li> </ul> 
<p>In order to get scim to work in almost everywhere in KDE, some settings 
need to be done.<br>
 First, in your <strong>~/.bashrc</strong> file, add in 
this line.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>export LC_CTYPE=&rdquo;zh_CN.UTF-8&Prime;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This will export your LC_TYPE as zh_CN.UTF-8 since we have already set all 
these to en_US.UTF-8. This is per user&rsquo;s local setting, for my case 
I&rsquo;ve set my LC_TYPE to zh_CN.UTF-8<strong>system wide</strong>, with this 
command.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>dpkg-reconfigure localesconf</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Use this command to set scim as your default input method for X.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>update-alternatives &ndash;config xinput-all_ALL</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Again this is my system wide setting. For user&rsquo;s local setting, add 
these lines in your ~/.bashrc</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>export XIM=SCIM<br>
 export XIM_PROGRAM=/usr/bin/scim<br>
 export 
XIM_ARGS=&rdquo;-d&rdquo;<br>
 export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim<br>
 export 
QT_IM_MODULE=xim</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Restart your X-server, and login to KDE. In any text input field(Gaim, 
Firefox, Xchat, Open Office, Thunderbird and more), when you hit<strong>
CTRL+Space</strong>, the scim toolbar will pop up and you are able to input 
chinese text. CTRL+Space again to switch back to English.</p> 
<p>Remember not to install the Skim(KDE frontend for scim), as it will somehow 
freeze your keyboard frequently.</p></li> </ol>
