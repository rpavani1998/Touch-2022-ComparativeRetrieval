<h1>Desktop or Laptop</h1> 
<p> <strong>31</strong> <strong>Aug</strong> </p> 
<p>Posted by Hemal in <em>Hardware</em></p> 
<p><em>Do I buy a laptop or a desktop computer for my next machine?&nbsp; I am 
not sure if laptops are just replacing desktops and if I should just not waste 
my money on a desktop or if they are still better computers.&nbsp; Thanks.</em>
</p> 
<p>Laptops are becoming more prevalent in the tech world today, becoming the 
staple of computing especially on the college scene.&nbsp; Desktops, the office 
work horse, are slowly becoming edged out of the picture due to their lack of 
portability&hellip;but are they being underrated?</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering buying either a new desktop or laptop, you have 
to view the pros and cons of both and whether which would serve you 
better.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s outline a few.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Laptop computers are portable, have the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; no cord image 
and can travel with you.&nbsp; They are becoming very light, increasingly more 
powerful and have better features as the days go on.</p> 
<p>Desktop computers are the ultimate powerhouse, out perform laptops and are 
much cheaper with the ability to upgrade making them less obsolete and 
preserving your investment longer.</p> 
<p>The user for a laptop should be purchasing the laptop because they want to 
carry it around with them and be mobile with their computing.&nbsp; They should 
not care too much about battery life and be willing to spend more money to 
purchase less.</p> 
<p>A desktop user should be looking for a more high end type of computer but 
lack of portability.&nbsp; The desktop user may have a limited budget but will 
have the ability to continually upgrade the desktop over time to continue to 
preserve its longevity and life in an increasingly growing industry.</p> 
<p>High end demand and low budget = Desktop</p> 
<p>Portability and higher budget/need of slim and sleek = Laptop</p>
