<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Jan 13 2012</em> - Toshiba's reworking of their $1000 priced Satellite 
P775 does a better job of balancing out the 17-inch laptops features. While it 
does drop the Blu-ray drive and quad core processor in favor of a dual core, 
the addition of a dedicated NVIDIA graphics processor boosts the overall 
capabilities of what the laptop can be used for. It would have been nice to see 
them keep the Blu-ray at this price point and drop the number of applications 
installed that slow down the boot times but overall, Toshiba's changes are 
generally an improvement for consumers looking at a general purpose 17-inch 
laptop.</p>

<h3>Review - Toshiba Satellite P775-S7368</h3> 
<p><em>Jan 13 2012</em> - Toshiba has made a few modifications to it Satellite 
P775 that is priced around $1000. Thepast model offered a high performance quad 
core processor. This is great for those looking to do tasks like desktop video 
work. Most consumers tendnot to use their computers for such demanding tasks. 
Because of this, Toshiba has reduced the processor down to an Intel Core 
i5-2430M dual core which still offers a fair amount of performance and more 
than enough for the average user. Memory stays the same at 6GB of DDR3 memory 
that allows for a generally smooth overall experience with the Windows 7 
operating system.</p> 
<p>In addition to reducing the processor, Toshiba has replaced the Blu-ray 
compatible optical drive with a standard dual-layer DVD burner. Since the high 
definition optical format hasn't taken off like DVD did and more people are 
using digital media files and streaming, this isn't a big loss for some but it 
is notable as Toshiba does market the P series laptops as entertainment 
focused. The remaining storage features have all been left the same. This 
includes a 750GB hard drive that is larger than the average 17-inch laptop 
currently so there is more space for storing applications, data and media 
files. The drive spins at the traditional 5400rpm rate that means it it lacks a 
bit in performance compared to systems using 7200rpm drives. Toshiba still 
includes a singleUSB 3.0 port for adding high speed external storage if this 
isn't enough space to store all your files.</p> 
<p>The other significant change to the Satellite P775-S7368 is the graphics 
system. Rather than relying on the Intel HD Graphics that is built into the 
Intel processor, it now uses an NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M graphics processor. This 
adds significant 3D performance such that the laptop is now a viable casual PC 
gaming platform. It still may struggle to have high detail levels especially at 
higher resolutions but this isn't designed for gaming like theQosmio series is. 
In addition to helping 3D applications, the NVIDIA graphics offer a broader 
support foraccelerating non-3D applications such as Photoshop compared to the 
Intel QuickSync feature. Since Toshiba has dropped the Blu-ray drive from the 
system, the fact that the 17.3-inch display only has a 1600x900 resolution 
isn't as much of a problem. Performance from the panel is fairly typical and 
the standard glossy coating can make it difficult to use outdoors or in certain 
conditions without a fair amount of glare and reflections.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Toshiba has not dealt with the extreme number of 
preinstalled programs that come on the Satellite P775. Toshiba has installed a 
large number of branded utilities and software applications onto the system. 
Many of these are fairly frivolous or just too elaborate for what they need to 
do. Some duplicate functions already included in the OS or other software 
installed. The result is a desktop that gets more cluttered and too many things 
loading at startup that slows down the boot process. Users will want to pick 
and choose what they want to keep and remove.</p> 
<p>Like most consumer laptops, the Satellite P775-S7236 comes equipped with a 
six-cell battery pack that is rated with a 48WHr capacity. DVD playback tests 
yielded just under three hours before going into standby mode. This is pretty 
typical of a laptop with these features and battery size. More typical usage 
will yield close to Toshiba's 4.18 hour claim.</p> <br>
