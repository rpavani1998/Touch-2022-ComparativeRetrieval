<h1>Desktop or Laptop for Online College</h1> 
<p>Have you ever wondered which computer works best for you, a desktop or 
laptop foronline college? Well, wonder no more. It really comes down to 
personal preference and budgetary constraints. In reality, a computer exists 
for every person and every budget.</p> 
<h2>Desktops</h2> 
<p>Which is right for you, a desktop or laptop for online college? Each type 
of computer offers a specific set of advantages and disadvantages for each 
potential owner. You must evaluate which is right for you. Many times, a 
desktop computer provides users with a greater value in overall product 
offerings for the price you will pay. As laptops grew in popularity, the price 
of desktops lowered. Not everyone needs a laptop. Many people work from home. 
&nbsp;Therefore, they take their courses through online universities from home. 
Having a desktop provides people with more storage, memory, and faster speed 
than a typical laptop provides for the average student.</p> 
<p>If you cannot afford a computer in your home, the public library offers 
free use of their desktop computers. If you have a two-hour exam and the 
library only allows for one-hour usage periods, speak with someone who can help 
you extend your computer time. Most libraries will allow exceptions, if you 
speak with them beforehand. If you have a desktop in your home and it is quite 
old, you can upgrade your system without incurring a huge investment. All you 
need are new memory cards and a flat screen monitor to provide yourself with 
the modern conveniences of a brand new desktop.</p> 
<p>The most obvious disadvantage of a desktop is the lack of mobility. People 
with laptops take them everywhere; they work from anywhere and everywhere. With 
a desktop, if you want to work on an assignment over your lunch hour at work, 
you cannot pick up and go to a quiet corner in a cafe or park to get away from 
your desk. You may be able to log in from your work computer remotely. However, 
you remain chained to your desk if you work on a desktop. Desktops have a few 
other disadvantages. However, none is as noteworthy as the lack of flexibility.
</p> 
<h3>Laptops</h3> 
<p>Let us this question from another perspective. Which do you prefer, a 
desktop or laptop for online college? The greatest advantage of the laptop is 
the greatest weakness of the desktop. Mobility is worth every penny to most 
people. If you want to take your family on a vacation, while you have time off 
from work, you do not need to sit at home to ensure you turn in your 
assignments. You can take off for Florida and turn in your assignments from the 
hotel. A great disadvantage of the laptop is the cost. In addition, these 
mobile miracles are more likely to break or pilfered. At the end of the day, 
you must find a computer to meet your needs and budget.</p> 
<p>The decision of a desktop or laptop for online college is yours. Today, a 
computer is available for all budgets. The most important point is to take
online courses to enhance your career.</p> Click to Find a School  that Offers
