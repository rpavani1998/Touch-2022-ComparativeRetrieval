<p><em>The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.</em> </p> 
<p> ---Samuel Clemens, also know as Mark Twain </p> 
<p> Many variations of this &quot;reports of my death&quot; quote exist. The 
original note was written May 1897 in the author's hand. He wrote, &quot;James 
Ross Clemens, a cousin of mine was seriously ill two or three weeks ago in 
London. The report of my illness grew out of his illness, the report of my 
death was an exaggeration&quot;.</p> 
<p> Similarly, depending on the writer, many variations exist about the 
usefulness of Linux on desktops and laptops. In some ways, I understand the 
confusion and the various conclusions people draw. Recently, I had the 
opportunity to install Linux on an IBM ThinkPad, and both ingenuity and a 
commitment to complete the job were required. That's not what I expected at the 
start. I found Linux useful immediately. Later, I found the software I needed 
to make it work the way one would expect from a manufacturer.</p> 
<p> As you read this article, keep this Samuel Clemens quote in mind. The 
majority of us have a tendency to avoid details and jump on the first 
generalization that comes around. I'm reminded of statement attributed to Al 
Gore that he &quot;invented the Internet&quot;. In fact,he said, &quot;During 
my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the 
Internet&quot;. And, if you look at his history, he did take the initiative and 
helped create the Internet. The media, on the other hand, ran with the quote 
attributed to him. Don't fall into that trap if you can avoid it.</p> Desktop 
Linux on a Laptop<br>

<p> Recently, I bought a laptop. I consulted several friends to get a 
consensus as to which one would work best with Linux. Tallying the results, I 
decided to go with an IBM ThinkPad. I chose a barely used model T21 with a 
Pentium III 800, a 20GB hard drive, 256MB of RAM and a DVD-ROM. Prices ranged 
all over the place, but I found a one for less than $300.</p> 
<p> Once the laptop arrived, I began searching around on Google to see which 
Linux distributions people used on ThinkPads. I even found a ThinkPad mailing 
list and some distribution-oriented laptop ones. Then, I found a tutorial that 
convinced me to go with Fedora Core 3.</p> Laptop or Portable Computer? <br>

<p> Reading through the archives of the mailing lists, I started to conclude 
that most people used Linux on laptops as portable computers. Seeing comments 
referring to the battery as a UPS gave it away. Then, I started asking some 
hard questions and the answers convinced me that an information void exists. 
You certainly can use a laptop as a portable computer, but that's not how I 
intended to use it.</p> 
<p> I went back to my friends and began asking how they used the function keys 
and buttons on their ThinkPads. As you might guess, they didn't use them. They 
also thought that the battery life seemed short. Of course, having all laptop 
functions fully operational at all times reduces the battery life.</p> 
<p> As I continued to research Linux on the laptop, I found a scarcity of new 
material. Furthermore, many of the items I did find seemed less than useful. 
But, I did find nuggets of gold that allowed me to use my ThinkPad the way I 
wanted.</p> Finding the Best Distribution <br>

<p> Although the Fedora tutorial gave me many of hints on how to configure 
tools to take advantage of the ThinkPad's built-in functionality, Fedora did 
not work for me. I decided to stay with 256MB of RAM, primarily so I could help 
Linux users who could not afford to add the memory needed to get to 512MB. 
Perhaps if I upgraded to a higher level of memory, I could use Fedora. At 256MB 
of RAM, however, Fedora creeped. I felt like I was using a memory-starved 
Microsoft Windows machine.</p> 
<p> Call it a challenge, but many postings exist on the mailing lists I follow 
from international users who simply can't afford to upgrade their memory. To an 
American, it doesn't seem so unrealistic simply to upgrade. To friends in 
Hungary, the costs seem high.</p> 
<p> I spent the better part of two days trying a variety of distributions. 
Before people start writing comments about how much better their distributions 
run than the one I chose, let me say I played no favorites. I wanted 
performance and I got it with Ubuntu. Contrary to what some of you might 
believe, it's not my favorite Linux distro. It simply performed the best in 
this case.</p> Making the ThinkPad Act Like a Laptop <br>

<p> Later this month, I will cross the globe. The first leg of my journey will 
take 24 hours, and I have a speaking engagement about 12 hours after I arrive. 
So, preserving battery life and connecting wirelessly seem important. I also 
want to use the time to work.</p> 
<p> I believe a manufacturer should do the things I did to get Ubuntu working 
on the ThinkPad. In a way, it helps prove up my argument that if Linux were 
bundled on HP, Lenovo, Dell, Gateway and so on, it would be as acceptable to 
users as is OS X or Windows. More on that a little later.</p> 
<p> Once I installed Ubuntu on the ThinkPad, I had to add packages from 
various repositories, including Universe and Multiverse. The first packages I 
added include linux-image- 2.6.10-5-686, linux-source-2.10.10 and 
linux-headers-2.6.10-5. Ubuntu calls their kernel packages linux-images instead 
of kernel-image. Once I added the packages, I rebooted into the Linux 686 
environment.</p> 
<p> Next, I searched, found and installed the tpb package through Ubuntu's 
Synaptic application. According to thetpb Web site: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> TPB is a little program that enables you to use the IBM ThinkPad(tm) 
special keys.</p> 
<p> With TPB it is possible to bind a program to the ThinkPad, Mail, Home and 
Search button. TPB can also run a callback program on each state change with 
the changed state and the new state as options. So it is possible to trigger 
several actions on different events. TPB has a on-screen display (OSD) to show 
volume, mute, brightness and some other informations. Furthermore TPB supports 
a software mixer, as the R series ThinkPads have no hardware mixer to change 
the volume.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> I noticed the ability to change the volume and use other keys immediately. 
</p> 
<p> Next, using Synaptic, I searched for &quot;thinkpad&quot; and found 
thinkpad-base and thinkpad-source. I marked those for installation and clicked 
apply. They installed.</p> 
<p> According to the maintainer's Web site: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> This package contains the source code for the loadable driver modules used 
by the tpctl utility for configuring IBM ThinkPad laptop computers. Included 
are the sources for drivers of the Super I/O and RT/CMOS RAM chips, for an 
interface to the IBM ThinkPad SMAPI BIOS, and for an interface to the ThinkPad 
APM subsystem.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> As the Web page refers to tpctl, I searched for that package in Synaptic 
and also installed it.</p> 
<p> According to the tpctl Web site at Sourceforge: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> tpctl is a package of configuration tools for Linux. </p> 
<p> The centerpiece of the package is tpctl, a program that does some of what 
PS2.EXE does under DOS and the ThinkPad Configuration program does under 
Windows...</p> 
<p> tpctl gives the user access to all the functions of the SMAPI BIOS that 
are documented in the various ThinkPad Technical Reference manuals. It can also 
control the resources used by the parallel and serial ports. The USAGE output 
and the README file should give a rough idea of what the program can do...</p> 
<p> Packages included in tpctl include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p>tpctl -- command line ThinkPad control program</p></li> 
<li>
<p>ntpctl -- ncurses ThinkPad control program</p></li> 
<li>
<p>tpctlir -- a utility that enables or disables the infrared subsystem on 
ThinkPads with Programmable Option Select</p></li> 
<li>
<p>apmiser -- a daemon that automatically controls power expenditure mode 
(using tpctl) according to CPU usage</p></li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p> Finally, I discovered configure-thinkpad, a GNOME GUI tool for tpctl. 
According to theWeb site: &quot;configure-thinkpad is a GNOME ThinkPad 
configuration tool written by Cheuksan Edward Wang. The purpose of this tool is 
to make configuring ThinkPad easier. This GUI application uses GNOME 2 and is 
based on tpctl and ntpctl.&quot;</p> 
<p> Unfortunately, I didn't find configure-thinkpad in the Ubuntu 
repositories. You can download the tarball from the tpctl site, though, and 
configure it using these steps, once you satisfy all the dependencies.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p>Uncompress the tar.gz file </p></li> 
<li>
<p>cd into the uncompressed file directory </p></li> 
<li>
<p>Run the ./configure command as user</p></li> 
<li>
<p>Run sudo make</p></li> 
<li>
<p>Run sudo make install </p></li> </ol> 
<p>Figure 1. Screenshot of configure-thinkpad</p> 
<p> Here, you need to do some command-line work to get Ubuntu to work with the 
packages you downloaded. Let's take them one at a time. First, you need to 
provide the Linux kernel source. When you installed linux-source, it downloaded 
linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 into the directory /usr/src. Move to that 
directory, and you will see it. To unpack it, use the command</p> 
<pre> sudo tar jxvf linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 </pre> 
<p> Now, your sources are available. </p> 
<p> Earlier we referred to thinkpad-base and thinkpad-source. thinkpad-source 
contains the source code for the drivers. The package is set up so that 
make-kpkg compiles the correct driver sources for the kernel you are running.
</p> 
<p> tpctl contains everything but the drivers. For this, you need the 
thinkpad-modules package, which can be built from the thinkpad-source package.
</p> 
<p> David Tansey, a Ubuntu user and contributor who has written HOWTOs for the 
community, provided us with some commands through the ThinkPad mailing list. He 
suggested going to /usr/src/ and runningtar -xzf thinkpad.tar.gz. Then: </p> 
<pre> cd modules/thinkpad/2.6/drivers make sudo make install </pre> 
<p> This creates the /dev/think device needed to run tpctl. </p> 
<p> Next, run ./autogen.sh. You need to install the following dependencies so 
you can build configure-thinkpad:</p> 
<pre> libbonobo2-dev libbonoboui2-dev libgconf2-dev libglade2-dev 
libglib2.0-dev libglade2-dev libgnome2-dev libgnomeui2-dev libgtk2.0-dev</pre> 
<ul> 
<li>1</li> 
<li>2</li>

<p>I did the same thing with windows to figure out a problem to help a friend 
and I found it very frustrating - download this driver download this 
anti-something program. very frustrating.</p> 
<p>I agree with the article if time was spent in configuring a linux laptop 
instead of a windows one it would be superior in all aspects. The user would 
just do their work and have no adminstration tasks. But I guess the vendors 
would rather download all these anti-programs and give the customer crap 
software with otherwise outstanding hardware.</p>

<p>Well - as long you have an internet-connection, the driver-installation is 
extremely painless (in Windows-XP), as the latest drivers are downloaded from 
the MS-Database. Most of the times you don't even need the driver-cd. That's 
really cool 8-)</p> <br>

<h3> Looking for IBM T21 Win/Lin.Modem under Linux 2.6 /Suse 9.3 </h3> <br>
 
Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Tue, 08/02/2005 - 03:41. 
<p>Hello dear IBM, Linux and Suse, users or experts, </p> 
<p>This article seems very interesting and perhaps around it, you could give 
me some helpfull advices about Linux T21 modem software customization.</p> 
<p>I have an IBM Thinkpad T21 on which I have installed Linux 2.6 within Suse 
9.3, and<br>
 unlucky, there was a winmodem installed on, combined with an 
ethernet connection.</p> 
<p>When it was only under Windows, that seems to be ok.<br>
 Now launching it 
under Linux, it's not the same thing.</p> 
<p>When I go out of my home and have to connect me under Linux on Internet 
through a basic<br>
 or standard phone line ... I need that there was a running 
modem or LinModem<br>
 to surf above Internet and retrieve informations or 
mails outside !</p> 
<p>That is very important for me. </p> 
<p>Have you already meet a similar issue or matter, or did you know what to do
<br> in that case !? </p> 
<p>Thanks a lot for any help and advices ... </p>

<h3> Laptop / Portable Computer Concept: </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Martin (not

<p>Great article. Thanks for taking the time and making the effort.</p> 
<p>&quot;You certainly can use a laptop as a portable computer, but that's not 
how I intended to use it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Tom; could you expand on this a little more? I've always had one or the 
other. Right now I have both (a laptop and a beefy tower), but the tower is 
more of a server than a workstation. I think it would be interesting to hear 
your take on the function of both, and how you &quot;... intended to use it 
[the laptop].&quot;</p> 
<p>Thanks, Martin</p> 
<h3> Laptop / Portable Computer Concept </h3> <br>
 Submitted by tadelste on 
Mon, 08/01/2005 - 13:49.<br>

<p>Martin,</p> 
<p>I'm glad to expand on the concept. </p> 
<p>The first laptops were actually portable computers. They didn't have 
batteries. The first one I used was an Osbourne. It had two floppies and a 
small screen plus free software and sold for less than $2000. The next one was 
a Compaq and finally I bought an IBM portable. None of these had batteries.</p> 
<p>In my view, a laptop is a battery powered computer that I can take with me 
when I board a plane and use it to do work or watch a DVD. It doubles as the 
computer I use to make presentations.</p> 
<p>I have typically used Thinkpads in the past and so I am familiar with them. 
I did have an iBook a couple of years ago and it was OK but didn't work that 
well with Linux. I have also had Toshibas and Compaqs. I only used those for 
presentation purposes.</p> 
<p>My partner bought a Thinkpad T21 and has liked it a lot. He also has an 
iBook. I checked around and other friends were using Thinkpads. So, I just went 
to eBay and bought one. It turned out to have very little use and the price was 
fine.</p> 
<p>I have a lab with a number of different computers I use for testing and I 
have many different distributions of Linux running in the lab. Right now, I'm 
running my primary desktop system and it has Fedora Core 4 running at the 
moment.</p> 
<p>Last week, I took my recently acquired laptop to the Middle East with me 
and it worked fine. When I got home, I copied my files to this desktop and now 
I'm set to work again in the US. I may have two trips and three presentations 
between now and early September and I'll take the laptop with me and use it for 
both presentation purposes and to work while I'm away.</p> 
<p>I found Ubuntu to work best on my particular laptop. It's gnome based and 
easy to sync directories when I return.</p> 
<p>As far as my home computer, I prefer to work on a tower based system 
because it allows me to use a large LCD monitor, runs much faster and simply 
performs better than the laptop. That doesn't mean the laptop isn't a great 
tool for traveling or for heading over to a Starbucks and working wirelessly.
</p> 
<p>My next adventure will include installing FreeNX on the laptop to see if I 
can sync my directories while on the road.</p> 
<p>To sum up, I suppose that I consider laptops necessary to consultants and 
sales people. But for doing IT work, I prefer working on a fast and more 
powerful PC.</p> 
<p>I hope that answers your question. </p> 
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Tom;</p> 
<p> Nice. As a developer, I made a conscious choice to do my development on my 
laptop, as opposed to a desktop, so that I could do it &quot;anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p> It's nice to know that that are reasonable non-Windows, non-Mac mobile 
solutions for professionals; thanks for putting another stone on the path that 
paves the way.</p>

<h3> A bit dated here aren't we. </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Anonymous (not 
verified) on Sat, 07/30/2005 - 02:07. 
<p>With all do honesty I began to worry when I saw the all to popular 
&quot;I've got this old piece of junk that won't run XP right ..... &quot;Let's 
install Linux!&quot; Followed by all of the usual &quot;problems&quot; usually 
caused by poor research and not paying attention to details.</p> 
<p>1. KDE includes the tools for Viao Toshiba and IBM laptops by default. Once 
configured there.. the configs hold for Gnome.</p> 
<p>2. Before running around like crazy being leet and cool and grabbing 
software left and right ..... check out what is already there in your distro. 
Fedora and Ubunto both include tools for IBM laptops. (For example tpctl is 
part of the Ubunto distro!)</p> 
<p>I've been running desktop Linux for over 6 years. (not dual boot either 
uless you count having more than one OSS OS) On laptops for the last 4, 
exculsively. (I just replaced my Armada 500mhz .... hardware failure beyond 
repair.) In fact I've got a couple of old 233mhz Thinkpads running as semi-thin 
clients. (more like super PDA's) You really did manage to take something as 
simple as installing Linux and turn it into a problem. BTW 256MB is more than 
enough.</p> 
<h3> Linux is (should be) perfect </h3> <br>
 Submitted by Anonymous (not

<p>Linux is (should be) perfect to utilize older hardware because it isn't as 
bloated as new OSs in order to get more modern functionality. The renown 
stability of Linux implies being able to go for weeks on a desktop without a 
reboot by simply doing a quick s3 suspend and resume as we've done with the 
older Windows OSs. However, it is absolutely maddening to get an IBM T20 (once 
one of THE most popular laptops) under Linux to do something Windows 95 can 
do!! - suspend and resume. To a newb, all the hype and promise of Linux 
evaporates rapidly when faced with that. Every relative newb who tries this 
thinks there must be something simple they are overlooking to get something so 
basic to work, hence the newb questions, expecting not a complete set of 
instructions (which is needed) but a quick one line &quot;just hit this switch 
or run this one command&quot; - not expecting that to get it to do that is as 
complicated as it is for them. I get the thing about printer drivers and 
winmodems and I accept that. But that Linux has such a hard time with suspend 
and resume IN GENERAL &quot;implies&quot; (I understand why but to newbs this 
is what it seems like) either someone is asleep at the wheel, or there is some 
underlying stick in the spokes of the whole Linux OS preventing it from 
smoothly implementing such a basic function as a suspend/resume. No free Linux 
distro will suspend/resume out of the box on a T20 except for possibly SUSE, 
which is almost too big for it.</p> 
<p>Having said that, I am using linux on every computer in my house and still 
believe in it.</p>

<p>Hey Troll, you didn't read the article. Did you. He didn't say anything 
about a piece of junk that wouldn't run XP so let's try Linux. You said that. 
He said, the Linux desktop works. If you've been running a Linux desktop since 
1999, what were you running? What web browser? What word processor?</p> 
<p>You're full of it. You know it, I know it and whoever cares to read this 
post knows it.</p> 
<p>BTW, I've run Linux long before you and we didn't have no stinking desktop.

<p>That's you. Let's see I've run SuSE since 6.2, RedHat first started about 
4.2 (Along with Afterstep) Heavily into Mandrake since 6.0 came out. (Yes I've 
had more than one computer at a time ... I also know how to multi-Boot.... 
ooooooooooooo..... first distro I tried was ygdrassil... but slackware was the 
first one I was comfortable with.) Currently I run mostly Debian.</p> 
<p>browsers. Netscape since 3.1 Konqueror... (Ok up until 3.0 not so useful) 
Opera ... it's Ok but I'm not much of a fan. Links ... when you really need to 
be fast and light.</p> 
<p>Wordprocessors. Most of the time (as in 99.9%) I don't need to create non 
ascii documents. But reading them is needed. Star office has supplied that for 
ages. Not to mention a number of &quot;readers&quot; available. OOo is my 
current office suite. Abiword has always been a better reader than writer up 
until they finally got it to 1.0. Gnumeric rocks with excel, and has for a long 
time.</p> 
<p>Congrats on not having a desktop. I find that utterly useless to know. I 
also doubt that you've used computers or Unix before me. Linux... Maybe ... If 
you know what bootstraping is. If you have who cares. My OS background has been 
mainly Linux BSD Xenix Unix Amiga, OS/2 and Some DOS (very little pre 3.0) And 
a number of &quot;unique to the system&quot; OS's in the early 80's. (ok there 
was a bit of time with a TI-99....)</p> <br>

<p>The poster had a legitimate comment. The information in the article was 
useful. The added commentary was also useful but it was presented in an 
adversarial fashion. The author was ignorant of these inclusions (he was 
running Gnome afterall and many of the &quot;included&quot; configurators were 
in KDE) and it would have been great to say, &quot;Hey, good info, but did you 
know that blah, blah, blah....?&quot;</p> 
<p>Making people feel like a twit in order to appear superior is a 
small-minded tactic and does the community no favors. For others to jump on top

<h3> Suspending? </h3> <br>

<p>What about suspending your laptop? Either to disk or to RAM, I don't care, 
it's the one single thing I couldn't get working with Gentoo on my laptop (a 
Dell Lattitude D800) it does longer on batteries in Linux than in Windows, but 
not being able to suspend it really is a pain...</p>

<br> I use the acpitool -s option, and my ibm thinkpad t21 suspends without 
problems. Maybe you'll need some extensions for you Dell.</p> <br>

<h3> Thinkpad and Mandriva - a fan-boy speaks out :-) </h3> <br>
 Submitted by 
syd (not verified) on Fri, 07/29/2005 - 04:21. <br>

<p>Hmmm... funny how people get so cross about mandriva... oh well, moving 
on...</p> 
<p>I have been using mandrake and now mandriva on a standard Thinkpad T23 for 
two years. I don't use the internal modem and have a pcmcia wi-fi card i.e. it 
is not a model with built-in wireless card.</p> 
<p>Can't speak for the parent poster but yes, I did read the article and yes, 
I can confirm that the volume and mute buttons and all the special key 
functions - i.e. reading light on/off, screen brightness, switch to external 
display, screen off - worked immediately 'out of the box' under mandriva 10.1 . 
In other words, everything except power-saving. Suspend-to-ram is easily 
enabled by clicking through a few menus although editing one config file may be 
necessary. A little extra work is needed pre-install if suspend-to-disk is 
required.</p> 
<p>The trackpoint works too as does a usb mouse and external keyboard. Magic 
sys-request is enabled and Alt-Graphics is enabled as the Compose key for 
&aacute;cc&ecirc;nt&egrave;d ch&eth;ract&euro;rs. Out of the box. I hope these 
things are not some kind of big deal.</p> 
<p>On a slightly different but related issue, tv-out may not work, nor does 3D 
graphics. AFAIK this is an Xorg issue which is the same for all distros 
although there is a proprietary free-beer driver available which apparently 
gives 3D graphics and may support tv-out. Never needed either of these so never 
tried it.</p> 
<p>In 2005LE Fn-F3 (screen off) does not work for me - possibly another X 
issue - and I have had bigger problems with power-saving but every other button 
and Fn key again works (ahem) 'out of the box'. Specifically, apm does not work 
for me at all. ACPI works for suspend-to-ram but not suspend-to-disk. 
Everything else is perfect and overall it suits my needs but as always, it all 
depends what you want and what trade-offs you are willing to make.</p> 
<p>Tom's article is OK as far as it goes but doesn't really say much except to 
advise you to install a few well-known Thinkpad utilities. I don't find them 
necessary and never installed them in 10.1 although they are available without 
needing any compiling etc. tpctl seems to be installed by default when the 
installer detects a thinkpad. Maybe the reason Tom's Suse-using friend didn't 
know they were there was for the same reason (i.e. maybe the laptop works fine 
with the standard install).</p> 
<p>Hopefully Tom will post a follow-up that gives some more detail about 
exactly what works and what doesn't including installing and configuring the 
wireless networking which hopefully is as trivial a non-issue in Ubuntu as it 
was in mandriva. Especially useful are things like the way it automatically 
switches from using wireless to ethernet for example. Plug-in an ethernet cable 
and I have ethernet, unplug it and insert wi-fi card and I have wireless 
networking. Very handy sometimes. I use a couple of different wi-fi cards (SMC 
2632W and Aironet 340) and also move seamlessly between home and a wi-fi 
hot-spot.</p> 
<p>Again, hopfully this is not something unusual otherwise I'll start to 
understand why some people think desktop linux is so difficult. It is of course 
well-known that although he is a major pundit, Tom never mentions Mandriva in 
his articles for some reason. Of course, something that works easily doesn't 
offer much for a professional problem-solver to write about :-)</p> 
<p>Ignoring the joky 'fan-boy' subject-line, I do use other distros and now 
there is a new version of Ubuntu I'll try it again when I have time and see if 
it now meets my needs, especially regarding the easy networking configuration 
and use. Like mandriva, it is a distro that supports the Free ethos and has a 
strong community around it with plenty of online-documentation/support, and it 
seems to 'just work' for a lot of people. I like that.</p>

 -------------</p> 
<p>Finally, for the online record, here is an outline of what I had to do to 
enable power-saving in mandrake 10.1 . This involved making sure that acpi was 
off and apm on (lilo and services sections in the Control Center), using the 
laptop control in the configuration menu (I use KDE) to enable and configure 
the battery monitoring/power-saving and making a couple of changes to the 
config file /etc/sysconfig/suspend to fix screen corruption, avoid being asked 
for a password after resuming and choose services to stop/start. Suspend-to-ram 
then worked perfectly using the appropriate keys (Fn-F4).</p> 
<p>To use suspend-to-disk you need to create the suspend partition first using 
a utility from the IBM Thinkpad support on the web.</p> 
<p>After some false starts I learned to do this before doing the full 
installation (only needs to be done once, not every re-install etc). I used the 
partitioning tool in the mandriva installer to shrink the XP NTFS partition 
first (works very well and no data loss BTW but XP does seem to need a minimum 
of about 10Gigs space), exited the install, created the suspend partition then 
installed mandriva. Did the above config steps and Fn-F12 suspend-to-disk was 
functioning.<br>

<p>I don't think ubuuntu is particularly faster, it's just that it installs a 
lot less by default so you don't have a pile of daemons using up your lovely 
memory and then making everything go v e r y s l o w l y when it starts to swap.
</p> 
<p>This comment made from a position of relative ignorance as I haven't 
actually tried either of these distros on my thinkpad (I used plain debian, 
which also works all the function keys and volume keys 'out of the box' so far 
as I can tell), but the above is what I have gleaned from postings on the 
thinkpad mailing list.</p>

<p>If you want a snappy window manager on a low powered system, the easy trick

distro is Gentoo, but you have to get a little dirty piecing it together.<br>

recompile allmost every package I have. So I changed distro on the way. My 
choise was Debian without bigger investigations.</p> 
<p>Your article is great, but it's bit ThinkPad oriented. So here are some 
links I found very helpfull.</p>

<p>That's not what he meant, that's support from the distro out, not support 
from the vendor itself. If you need to run ndiswrapper for something as common 
(we're talking laptops here) as a wireless card then your system is<strong>not
</strong> well supported.</p> 
<p>What he means is that manufacturers should use components with native Linux 
drivers available and give the option of obtaining the laptop with a Linux 
distro preloaded, or with<strong>no</strong> OS, but <b>with</b> the guarantee 
that every single feature works with Linux, and state that clearly on their 
sites.</p> <br>
