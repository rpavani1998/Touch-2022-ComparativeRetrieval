<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jan 6 2010</em> - Fujitsu sort of misses the mark 
with the LifeBook NH570. It mixes features that might appeal to corporate and 
consumers but fails to really address issues for both. It offers decent 
performance, improved battery life and some unique features to help let the 
laptop have a long lifespan, but there are too many features missing for its 
base price tag. Consumers can find alternatives that are smaller, more 
affordable and have additional features. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Display Offers Anti-glare Coating And Wide Viewing Angles</li> 
<li>Larger Eight Cell Battery Pack</li> 
<li>Spill Resistant Keyboard</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3>

<li>Large Display Doesn't Have Full 1080p Display</li>

<h3>Guide Review - Fujitsu LifeBook NH570 18.4-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop 
PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jan 6 2010</em> - The LifeBook N570 is a very different laptop from 
Fujitsu's typical lineup because it is so big. Even though it uses a large 
18.4-inch display, it is one of the lightest laptops to use such a display. 
Still, this is not as easy to carry around as a 17-inch laptop. Performance is 
strong with the system thanks to the higher clock speed Intel Core i7-620M dual 
core processor. It lags behind quad core models in tasks such as video editing 
but it does quite well at applications that aren't optimized for extra cores. 
The 4GB of memory is standard of most laptops and helps it run things smoothly.
</p> 
<p>Storage features on the LifeBook NH570 are a bit disappointing considering 
the $1400 price tag. It comes with a fairly average 500GB capacity hard drive 
but it spins at the more sedate 5400rpm rate that does impact performance 
compared to others than use 7200rpm. A bigger let down comes from the 
dual-layer DVD burner rather than using a Blu-ray compatible drive. Sure it can 
playback and record CDs or DVDs but missing out on playing HD movies on the go 
even though many similarly priced laptops are now offering this.</p> 
<p>The 18.4-inch display is probably one of the weakest aspect of the LifeBook 
NH570. For being so large, it falls short of a true 1080p HD display by only 
reaching a maximum 1680x945 resolution. In addition, the color and brightness 
just aren't as good as some of the other laptops out there. One nice aspect of 
display though is an anti-glare coating that does help reduce glare and 
reflections. Driving the graphics is an older NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics 
processor with 1GB of memory. It does not support Direct X 11 graphics and is 
better suited for HD media and casual PC gaming. Some older games will run 
smoothly at the maximum resolution but most will require reduced settings.</p> 
<p>Many companies have switched over to isolated keyboard designed but Fujitsu 
keeps a more traditional design. Thanks to the large size of the laptop, it 
comes with a full sized keyboard that includes a numeric keypad. One really 
nice touch from Fujitsu is the keyboard is spill resistant making small 
splashes of coffee or soda a non-issue for destroying your laptop. The trackpad 
is a fairly large size although off center from the spacebar. It also uses 
split buttons which is a nice change from the rocker bar used by many 
companies. Another unique feature to the laptop is a dust filter on the bottom 
of the laptop that can help extend the life of the laptop provided users 
remember to periodically clean it.</p> 
<p>Unlike most laptops, Fujitsu does ship the LifeBook NH570 with a larger 
eight cell battery with a 5200mAh capacity rating. It isn't as high capacity as 
some but does give it a bit more running time than most. In DVD playback tests, 
it yield just over two hours of running time before going into standby mode. 
While not as long as some smaller laptops this is above average for desktop 
replacements.</p> <br>
