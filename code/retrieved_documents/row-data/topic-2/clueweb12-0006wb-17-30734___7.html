<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 6 2011</em> - With a price tag of $800, the 
ASUS K73E-XA1 does have a good overall price for those looking for lots of 
storage space and support for Blu-ray media. The system also has a very 
comfortable albeit somewhat small keyboard. The problem is that the integrated 
graphics and poor viewing angles on the display make it less suitable for 
anything that is very graphic oriented. In addition, it lacks the new 
super-speed USB 3.0 or eSATA ports for use with high speed external storage.

<h3>Guide Review - ASUS K73E-XA1 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jul 6 2011</em> - The ASUS K73E series of laptops is more of a budget 
oriented laptop rather than a full performance desktop replacement. This is 
clearly evident as the current high end model K73E-XA1 uses a middle classed 
Intel Core i5-2410M dual core processor. This certainly provides good 
performance for most cases but those wanting to do desktop video would be 
better served by a quad core i7 processor. Continuing with the more budget 
theme, the processor is matched up with 4GB of DDR3 memory which lets it run 
smoothly but 8GB would be a better overall room for growth.</p> 
<p>Storage features for the ASUS K73E-XA1 are actually quite good for a laptop 
of this price range. It comes with a spacious 750GB hard drive that provides 
plenty of space for applications, data and media files. The drive does spin at 
a more modest 5400rpm rate but this is fairly typical for this price range. 
Even more surprising, ASUS also includes a Blu-ray compatible drive that allows 
the system to watch high definition movies on the go. The drive also has the 
capability to read or record to DVD and CD media as well. Those hoping to 
connect some high speed external storage will be disappointed that it does not 
come with USB 3.0 or eSATA ports at all.</p> 
<p>The display for the ASUS K73E is the same that was used in the previous K72 
series. It features a 1600x900 resolution that falls short of full 1080p HD 
video support for the Blu-ray drive but it does offer a fairly typical 
resolution for this size. Viewing angles are still quite poor which color 
shifting dramatically when viewed off center. The graphics system relies on the 
new integrated HD Graphics 3000 that are built into the new 2nd generation Core 
i processors. While this is a big improvement over previous Intel integrated 
graphics, it still isn't really going to be suited for those thinking of gaming 
on the side. It can do 3D gaming with Direct X 10 support but at much lower 
resolutions and detail levels than the 17-inch panel can support.</p> 
<p>The keyboard design of the ASUS K73E overall is pretty good but could use a 
bit of improvement. It uses the isolated style that the company has been using 
for some time and it works quite well. They even manage to put a full size 
numeric keypad in with it. The problem is that this design is similar to what 
one would see on a 15-inch class laptop. There is a lot of wasted space around 
the keyboard that could have been used for larger keys making it more 
comfortable to use for those with large fingers. The trackpad is spacious and 
this time around features individual right and left buttons rather than the 
rocker bar design.</p> 
<p>While the ASUS K73E-XA1 uses a six-cell battery pack, it has a slightly 
higher 5200mA rated capacity. In DVD playback tests, the laptop will run 
roughly two and three quarter hours before going into standby mode. More 
traditional usage should yield roughly three and a half hours of running 
time.This puts it about average for a laptop with these features and price. It 
certainly does much better than the AMD based K72D series laptops though.</p>
