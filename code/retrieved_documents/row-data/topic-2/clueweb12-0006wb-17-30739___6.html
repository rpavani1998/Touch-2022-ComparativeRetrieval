<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Aug 20 2011</em> - Tired of laptops with super small screens? The Acer 
Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 (LX.RJ207.008) is equipped with a 1080p 18.4 inch 
display that is nice and large for gaming. It also has a speedy quad-core 
processor and 8GB of memory with support for up to 16GB of RAM. Unfortunately, 
the slow hard drive is a bottleneck, and the video card isn't high end. 
However, if you are looking for a casual gaming system that also works well as 
a multimedia machine, the Acer Aspire Ethos 8951G fits the bill.</p> 
<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Large 1080p Display</li> 
<li>Blu-ray Disc Player</li> </ul>

<h3>Review - Acer Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 18.4 Inch Laptop</h3> 
<p>Although the Acer Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 retails for $1,600, the desktop 
replacement can be found on the street for $1,450 with rebates. The notebook 
has a 1920x1080 display (a high resolution screen is a must for an 18.4 inch 
laptop since it is so large). Speaking of big, the Aspire Ethos 8915G weighs in 
at 8.38 pounds so a system of this size is best used as a desktop replacement. 
The overall design is simplistic with a basic black chassis.</p> 
<p>As seen in most other systems in this price range, the Acer Aspire Ethos 
AS8951G-9600 has a quad-core Intel Core i7-2630QM processor that runs at 2.0GHz 
stock with Turbo Boost speed up to 2.9GHz. Overall, this CPU is nice and fast 
thanks to the new Sandy Bridge architecture. Having a quad-core processor is 
becoming quite standard in notebooks over $1,000, and the i7-2630QM doesn't 
disappoint.</p> 
<p>In regards to memory, the Acer Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 comes with 8GB of 
DDR3 RAM, although the notebook supports up to 16GB. It's important to see if a 
laptop is upgradable, especially if you plan on keeping the computer for an 
extended period of time.</p> 
<p>The Acer Aspire AS951G-9600 also functions well in casual games thanks to 
the NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M 2GB GDDR3 graphics card. While it can't compete with 
the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M, it does offer individuals a way to game on a large 
screen at a midrange price.</p> 
<p>Another nice feature on this laptop is the inclusion of a Blu-ray drive. 
Watching Blu-ray movies is a great way to take advantage of the large HD 
display. It's also great for students who use the laptop for multimedia. On the 
other hand, the hard drive is a disappointment. Although it is spacious at 
750GB, the drive is a slow 5400RPM model making it a bottleneck. For $1,450 or 
more a 7200RPM hard drive is a must as some systems even include SSDs.</p> 
<p>In terms of ports, the Acer Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 has one USB 3.0 and 
three USB 2.0 ports. I'd like to see an additional USB 3.0 connector, but the 
one is adequate. The laptop also has an HDMI port, which is nice since the 
system has a Blu-ray drive. If you don't own a stand-alone Blu-ray player or a 
PS3, you can connect it to an HDTV that has an HDMI port to watch Blu-ray 
movies on a big screen TV.</p> 
<p>Overall, the Acer Aspire Ethos AS8951G-9600 is best suited for casual 
gamers or those looking for a large 18.4 inch desktop replacement. It makes a 
great multimedia machine, but avid gamers will most likely want a better 
graphics card to take advantage of maxed out settings in the latest DirectX 11 
games.</p> <br>
