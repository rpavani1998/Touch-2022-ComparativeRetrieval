<h2>8 Jan 2009</h2> 
<h3> Laptops vs Desktop PCs </h3>  A recent Reuters' article asks: &quot; Is 
it the end of the desktop PC?&quot;. I guess it's partly true because almost 
everyone I know uses a laptop instead of a proper desktop PC. I guess the main 
reason is that they are so handy - they take up little space and are portable.
<br> <br>
However, many are not aware of the health hazards that using a laptop 
presents. Due to it's portability, a lot of people work with a laptop in 
awkward positions - lying on the bed, hunched over it on a park bench and so 
on. The small screens (in majority) and tiny closely set keyboards are not 
exactly ergonomic either.<br>
<br>
In fact it would be wrong to refer to some 
of them as &quot;laptops&quot; - a few of my friends have ones with massive 
17&quot; screens and weigh over 9 lbs. Using them placed on your lap for even 
half an hour would fry your private parts and might stop the blood circulation 
on your legs as well.<br>
<br>
Personally I prefer my my extremely fast desktop 
pc, with the ergonomic Microsoft keyboard and wide 22&quot; flat screen 
monitor. I guess the only disadvantage is that I cannot lug it around with me 
all the time but then neither do most of my friends using a laptop. Most of 
them use it as a desktop PC replacement. However, I might go for one of those 
mini laptops. Right now I have my eye on theDell Inspiron Mini 9. <br>
<br>

<p> I must be old fashioned because I choose the desktop. Yeah laptops 
arehandy but I still find them more useful for email and internet surfing. If i 
am working with dreamweaver, photoshop and other programs running, I'll take my 
loaded desktop thanks.</p> </dd>

<p> I will always prefer desktops because they are so much easier to upgrade 
and parts are cheaper for them then laptops. I would like a laptop eventually, 
when I have the money because it would mean I could watch tv and surf the net.

<p> I prefer using a laptop, simply bcos of my relatively high mobility, and 
I'm not a PC gamer. Moreover, RAM nowadays is cheap. It's quite affordable to 
have a lappie with 3GB or 4GB RAM, which translates to a speedy performer.</p>

<p> I was using a Desktop PC in College . Now , I 'm using a Laptop.I love my 
Laptop but I would definitely buy a Desktop for a Wider flat Screen monitor and 
for speed .I think both are complimentary and can't outdo much .</p> </dd>

<p> It sucks, because I really like laptops, but your arguments are 100% on, 
which is why I rarely if ever use mine (and why I got it cheap, just for travel 
in the first place). You can screw you wrist, shoulders and back up at a 
desktop bad enough. Most notebook users have no idea what they're doing to 
themselves.<br>
<br>
The other thing is, you can get a really nice beefed up 
desktop for very little money. If you'll be using it in the same place 85% of 
the time or more, I'd say get a nice desktop and a cheap and/or refurbished 
laptop that you'll use just on occasion and traveling. It's worked well for me.

<p> I would say both are equally important as per work. laptop is good for 
professionals while desktop is better for students and medium person being of 
cheaper accessories.</p> </dd>

<p> I have had a laptop as my primary machine for about 5 years now. I am 
never going back to a desktop ever again. The graphics cards in the laptops now 
are sufficient for gaming as well, so I am not lacking at all. In the office, 
however, there are desktop machines for everyone, and those that travel a lot 
have laptops as well. (Of course, as head of IT, I have 6 computers, both PCs 
and MACs, running windows, OS/X and Linux - but my laptop is still my main 
comp).</p> </dd>

<p> Indeed many of us have overlooked the health aspects. As you say we use 
them sitting and lying in awkward positions. Using them like that for hours 
together is bound to show in increased back and neck stress.</p> </dd>

<p> I have both desktop and laptop. I believe people still need desktop. both 
desktop and laptop have different function. Laptop don't have good graphic 
card. I cannot play a game that need fast graphic card in my laptop.</p> </dd>

<p> If I'm working, I prefer to work on a desktop. However, laptops are great 
when I travel (when I pretend I'm doing work, when I'm actually watching a film 
=P)<br>
<br>
I do find that when I'm working or watching a film, after a while 
my back/neck just starts to ache.<br>
<br>
However, for sheer practicality, I 
will say I prefer laptops.</p> </dd>
