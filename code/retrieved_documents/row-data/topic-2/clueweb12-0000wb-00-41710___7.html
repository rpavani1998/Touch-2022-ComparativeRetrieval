<li>selecting a pc</li> </ul> <em>Nov 2 2011</em> - Budget laptops are a tough 
market for manufacturers. They have to produce quality systems for as little as 
possible and that often involves trade offs in hardware or software features. 
Of course, each person might have a different idea of what they need in a 
budget laptop. Maybe it is for graphics, performance, portability or price. 
Below are my selections for the best budget laptops priced under $600 currently 
available for a variety of different uses and prices. 
<h3>Best Value - Lenovo Essential G570 15.6-inch</h3> &copy;Lenovo <br>
 There 
are a fair number of laptops that can be found for under $500 but most use 
older technology. The Lenovo Essential G570 uses a new Intel Pentium B940 dual 
core processor that uses the same technology as the second generation Intel 
Core i3 processors. It may not be as fast but for most people, they don't need 
the speed for web browsing, media watching or productivity software. The rest 
of the features are nearly identical to laptops costing almost $100 more. It 
comes with 4GB DDR3 memory, 500GB hard drive, dual layer DVD burner, 15.6-inch 
display, 802.11b/g/n wireless and Windows 7 Home premium. If you want a bit 
more performance and features for only a little more cash, theAcer Aspire 
AS5560G is priced around $520 and comes with a quad core AMD A8 processor. Read

<h3>Best Overall - Dell Inspiron 15R 15.6-inch</h3> &copy;Dell <br>
 At first 
glance, the Dell Inspiron 15R doesn't seem like it would merit the honor of 
best overall budget laptop. After all, its features are pretty much typical of 
just about every laptop priced around $600. It comes with a Core i3-2310M 
processor, 4GB DDR3 memory, 500GB hard drive, dual layer DVD burner, 15.6-inch 
display and 802.11b/g/n wireless. What really makes the Inspiron 15R stand out 
is the external expansion capabilities. The system includes two USB 3.0 and an 
eSATA port that allow for a wide range of high speed external peripherals. This 
means that it has life beyond most budget laptops. In addition, it is possible 
to find offers from Dell that can get upgraded storage, processors or memory at 
no cost. If the external peripheral ports aren't an issue but you want some 
better graphics, than theLenovo IdeaPad Z570 is a suitable alternative at $600 
if you happen to find one available. Read Review <br>

<h3>Most Portable - HP g4-1336nr 14-inch</h3> &copy;HP Inc. <br>
 15-inch 
laptops still tend to dominate the budget categories but there are a number of 
more compact options. The HP Pavilion g4-1226nr features much of the same 
features as its 15-inch competitors but weighs under 5 pounds and is more 
compact thanks to the 14-inch display. Features are pretty typical including an 
Intel Core i3-2330M dual core processor, 4GB DDR3 memory, 500GB hard drive, 
dual layer DVD burner and 802.11b/g/n wireless. The system does offer Bluetooth 
which is still fairly uncommon in budget systems and the keyboard is quite nice 
for a compact system. Prices range from $530 to $580. If you don't mind not 
having an optical drive and want an even more compact system, then theAcer 
Aspire AS3830T can be found for around $600 and offers much of the same 
performance. Buy Direct Read Review <br>

<h3>Best 3D Graphics - Acer Aspire AS560G-SB485 15.6-inch</h3> &copy;Acer <br>

 Laptops with dedicated graphics are very uncommon in budget oriented laptops. 
Acer is one of a few companies that actually offer such a feature. In the case 
of the Aspire AS5560G-SB485, it is an AMD Radeon HD 6470M graphics processor 
that can allow it to processor HD video better and even handle casual 3D 
gaming. Performance users will also be pleased with the AMD A8-3500M quad core 
processor that is beneficial for those looking to multitask or do desktop 
video. The rest of the features are pretty typical with a 500GB hard drive, 
15.6-inch display with 1366x768 resolution and 802.11b/g/n wireless. One 
warning though is that Acer installs a large amount of trialware on their 
systems. Priced between $520 and $600. An alternative with NVIDIA graphics and 
an Intel processor is theLenovo IdeaPad Z570 with pricing just under $600. Buy
