<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Jan 5 2012</em> - The spec sheet for the Gateway NV75S17u may make it 
seem like a high end desktop replacement laptop but its price under $650 is 
much more telling. In terms of a budget 17-inch system, it has some good points 
to it including a quad core processor, improved integrated graphics and a 
Blu-ray compatible drive. This makes it a good option for those that want an 
affordable laptop with a large display. They are a number of downsides to it 
that make it a bit disappointing though. This includes a display that won't do 
full HD video resolutions and peripheral ports that will limit the 
effectiveness of external expansion. Still, it is very affordable option for 
those looking at a low cost media laptop.</p>

<h3>Review - Gateway NV75S17u</h3> 
<p><em>Jan 5 2012</em> - Gateway has been heavily focusing on budget class 
laptops in the past few years since it has been acquired by Acer. The NV75S17u 
is just another in many low cost 17-inch laptops with a very affordable price 
of under $650. It achieves this by opting to use the AMD Fusion platform that 
consolidates features into fewer parts to keep overall costs down. For this 
desktop replacement class system, they chose to use the quad core A8-3500M that 
falls in the middle of the AMD quad core A series processor lineup. Performance 
wise, it falls well behind the Intel quad core mobile processors for demanding 
tasks but it does quite well with general purpose tasks and those that want to 
multitask average productivity programs. For its price, it certainly does a 
good job.</p> 
<p>The one really bright spot in terms of features on the Gateway NV75S17u is 
the addition of a Blu-ray compatible drive. This allows the laptop to be used 
as a mobile Blu-ray movie player either via the laptop itself or attached to an 
HDTV via the HDMI port. The drive can also handle playback and recording of DVD 
and CD media. Storage space for applications, data and media files is also 
quite good thanks to a decently sized 640GB hard drive that is still the size 
found in most laptops almost twice its price. It does spin at the more 
traditional 5400rpm rate which gives it modest performance compared to those 
that use 7200rpm drives. The big disappointment is the lack of the high speed 
peripheral ports used for high speed external storage. It would be nice to see 
eitherUSB 3.0 or eSATA on this laptop to give it a bit more external expansion 
capabilities.</p> 
<p>The 17.3-inch display of the Gateway NC75S17u is nothing special. It uses 
your typical TN panel that offers decent but not outstanding colors or viewing 
angles. It uses a glossy coating that is typical of most consumer laptops these 
days. The resolution is decent for its price at 1600x900 but it is 
disappointing that it can't reach a full 1080p high definition resolution for 
supporting Blu-ray movies as best as it can. The graphics system is integrated 
using the AMD Fusion design. For this processor, it comes matched up with the 
AMD Radeon HD 6620G which is certainly a step above what Intel has to offer 
with its Intel HD Graphics. For one, it has full Direct X 11 support and better 
overall 3D performance but you still wouldn't want to use it for more than 
casual PC gaming at lower resolutions and detail levels. What it does do is 
offer a bit more when it comes tousing it with non-3D applications such as 
Photoshop.</p> 
<p>Batteries can also be very expensive for manufacturers to put into a 
laptop. This is another area where Gateway seems to be cutting costs a bit. 
Rather than using an eight or nine cell battery pack, it comes with a six cell 
version with a relatively low 4000mA capacity rating. Now, this is not an 
uncommon battery size in models that are looking to reduce weight but this 
laptop weighs a pretty hefty 7.3 lbs. compared to others such as theSamsung 
RF711 that weighs nearly a pound less. In DVD playback tests, the system was 
able to run for just over three hours before going into standby mode. Blu-ray 
playback will yield around two hours as it is more demanding. This is a bit 
below average but considering the cost is not a huge tradeoff.</p> 
<p>As with most Gateway and Acer systems in the past year, the NV75S17u is 
plagued with a large amount oftrialware applications that come preloaded on the 
system. While these don't take up much of the storage space compared to the 
days when hard drives were much smaller, they still can adversely affect the 
overall performance of the system particularly when a system boots up. Buyers 
should take some time after the purchase to remove any unwanted programs to try 
and boost the boo times.</p> <br>
