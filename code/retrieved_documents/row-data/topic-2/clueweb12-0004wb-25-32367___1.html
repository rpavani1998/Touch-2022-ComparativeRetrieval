<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  Not all mobile professionals will have a desktop

<h3>Guide Review - Kensington Laptop Desktop USB 2.0</h3> 
<p>I have an older model Compaq and I've been quite impressed that the Laptop 
Desktop handles it with no problems. I also used a loaner ultra portable with 
it. It's been great to have something that works with older, heavier laptop 
models.</p> 
<p>The USB cord placed in the centre back has worked well with both laptops. 
You can reach either side of the laptop with no problem. There is no hassle 
connecting the Laptop Desktop to a USB port.</p> 
<p>I don&#146;t find the footprint a problem, some laptop desks use the same 
amount of space, so that hasn't been an issue for me.</p> 
<p>The built-in copyholder has certainly been useful and makes it much easier 
to work from a document, when you don't have to worry about an extra accessory 
for holding paper.</p> 
<p>If you use a wireless mouse with the Laptop Desktop, you've freed up one of 
the USB ports which can then be used for a scanner, digital camera or other USB 
enabled accessory. I found it useful being able to scan documents directly to 
my laptop rather than transferring the images from one computer to the other.
</p> 
<p>What I've enjoyed the most is bringing the laptop display up to a 
&quot;normal&quot; level for viewing. This makes it more comfortable to use my 
laptop regularly at my desk. With two displays, and my laptop going, having 
everything at the same level is a huge bonus.</p> 
<p>Using the Laptop Desktop will provide a great option to purchasing a second 
desktop for use at-home for mobile professionals and also allow you to work in 
a better ergnomic environment.</p> <br>
