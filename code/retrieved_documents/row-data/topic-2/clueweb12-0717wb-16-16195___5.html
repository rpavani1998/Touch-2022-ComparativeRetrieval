<p><i>November 19, 2009 By Reid Goldsborough </i> </p> 
<p><i>The Sony VAIO CW Series laptops (pictured), start at about $720, and 
have large 14-inch screens and keys with about the same size and spacing as 
desktop keyboards.</i></p> 
<p>For your next personal computer, should you go with a laptop PC even though 
you compute primarily at one location?</p> 
<p>More people have been answering this question in the affirmative. Sales of 
laptop PCs surpassed desktop PCs for the first time in the third quarter of 
2008, according to the market research firmiSuppli.</p> 
<p>Several factors explain the trend. Traditionally, desktops far outperformed 
laptops with cost, speed, storage capacity and reliability. Desktop PCs still 
have an advantage in these areas, but the difference has decreased 
dramatically. The smallest laptops, the netbooks, are now priced equivalently 
to the least expensive desktop PCs.</p> 
<p>The main advantage of laptops is the most obvious. Rather than being 
tethered to one spot, you can compute wherever you happen to be, whether from 
building to building, within an office, factory, house or even outside.</p> 
<p>This portability is accentuated by the recent improvements in wireless 
Internet technology, with wireless network adapters now built into most 
laptops. This and other advances make it easier to set up a network in a 
business or home and to connect to an existing Wi-Fi network for Internet 
access in selected airports, hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, 
libraries and college campuses.</p> 
<p>Stationary desktop PCs still have their benefits. Their greater speed and 
capacity make them better suited for video editing, computer aided design, and 
high-end gaming. A larger keyboard makes it easier to type and larger screen 
makes it easier to view. People using desktops are also generally less prone to 
ergonomic problems, such as neck and back strain from slumping over a small 
machine.</p> 
<p>Unless you're near an outlet, laptops are also limited by their battery 
life. And laptops are more easily stolen than larger desktop PCs, which is a 
big factor in organizational settings.</p> 
<p>Workarounds are available, however, to mitigate these issues. You can use a 
supplemental mouse, keyboard, and/or monitor with a laptop PC. Laptop stands 
can improve the ergonomics without requiring supplemental devices.AViiQ has 
recently introduced its Portable Laptop Stand which, unlike most other laptop 
stand, folds up so you can carry it along with the laptop.</p> 
<p>Some people carry an external laptop battery with them, which can double 
computing time. Energizer'sEnergi To Go XP18000 is a portable power pack that 
can charge a laptop and two other devices at once while away from an electrical 
outlet.</p> 
<p>Most laptops today have a security slot to secure the unit to a desk or 
other immovable object with a security cable and lock such as those from
Kensington.</p> 
<p>The word &quot;laptop&quot; has evolved into an umbrella term for 
&quot;portable computer.&quot; Portable PCs today come in four main flavors, 
listed here by decreasing size:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Desktop replacements</li> 
<li>Laptops</li> 
<li>Notebooks</li> 
<li>Netbooks. </li> </ul> 
<p>Variations include tablet PCs with touch screens that can be used without a 
keyboard and &quot;rugged&quot; laptops built to withstand strong vibrations, 
heat and cold, moisture and dust</p> 
<p>I've been experimenting with using a Sony VAIO desktop-replacement laptop 
as my main work machine to see how well it replicates my current desktop PC 
experience. Sony makes some of the most reliable laptop PCs, according to a 
study by</p> <br>

<dd> Until recently, there was no alternative to the familiar desktop

cash-strapped local governments, the desktop computer is quickly becoming an 
unsustainable option for future progress. Now, a technology known as virtual

more affordable than buying individual computers for every employee, and it 
provides similar capability. This paper shows how VDI is the future of the
