Didim Today <br>
<br>

<p>Computer is a important part of our life now. many years ago. we are often 
use desk computer for our life and work for promotion. and the latest few 
years, computer has developed from desk computer to laptop. and get more and 
more portable. but do you know what is the Difference between Laptop and 
Desktop computer?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's easier for a desktop computer to have a bigger memory and to hold more 
RAM than a laptop computer simply because there is more space available for the 
storage.</p> 
<p>The space in a desktop computer will often allow the user to choose almost 
unlimited accessories and options that a laptop computer just may not have the 
space to hold. Things like a top speed processor, the latest state of the art 
sound and graphics cards, extra ports for external linking and more than enough 
storage space for all of the programs, music and video clips that you'll ever 
need.</p> 
<p>The extra space also comes with one more big benefit that you don't often 
find with a laptop - the ability to easily upgrade. This means that you can 
keep your machine from becoming obsolete for much longer by continually adding 
the latest programs, components and accessories. The one glaring advantage a 
laptop computer holds over its desktop counter part is portability.</p> 
<p>If you have a job that requires you to travel, or if you're a student 
living in a closet sized dormitory with three others students, a laptop 
computer is practically a necessity. No matter how powerful or fast your 
desktop computer is, you can't unplug it, take it to the subway and finish 
writing your report while you travel.</p> 
<p>Despite the common misconception that all desktop computers are more 
powerful than all laptops, the laptop computers of today have much better 
technology in them than the laptops of yesterday. You will pay more for a 
supper powerful laptop than you will for the same caliber desktop, but then 
again, the lower price of the desktop won't help you on the go. I think the 
above illustrations tell you that both types of computer can be the best, 
depending on situation.</p> 
<p>The key isn't between choosing one over the other, it's in choosing the 
best computer of the type that you choose. You need to get online and do some 
research on the different brands of computers to find what the best and most 
reliable machines are.</p> 
<p>There are a slew of different manufacturers producing computers today, you 
need to find which manufacturer is producing the best reviewed computers of the 
type that you have determined that you need and base your decision on those 
facts.</p> 
<p>Buying a computer from a reputable and reliable manufacturer will ensure 
that you get a high quality machine. This is a piece of equipment that will be 
a big part of your life, hopefully, for years to come; you shouldn't look to 
get the cheapest price if it will mean that you are sacrificing quality.</p> 
<p>Never spend your hard earned money on a machine that has gotten a host of 
unfavorable reviews, or on a machine that you've never heard of.</p>
