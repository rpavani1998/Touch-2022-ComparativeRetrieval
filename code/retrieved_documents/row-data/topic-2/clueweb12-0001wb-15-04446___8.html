<p>Sometimes offers for desktop and laptop computers seem to be priced too low 
to be real. In the description of these products you might find the term 
refurbished. Both manufacturers and retailers may be offering these systems 
below what a normal PC costs, but what is a refurbished product and are they 
safe to buy?</p> 
<p>Refurbished computers typically fall into one of two categories. The first 
type have failed a quality control check during manufacturing. Rather than 
simply disposing of these systems, the manufacturer will rebuild it to pass 
quality control but sell it at a discounted price. The other type is a rebuilt 
system from a customer return likely due to a component failure.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Now the refurbishment of the product may be done by the manufacturer or a 
third party. Manufacturers rebuild the system using the same parts used in the 
new PCs. A third party that rebuilds the machine may use alternate parts to get 
it up and running. These alternate parts may change the system from its 
original design. This makes it important that the consumer read the 
specifications of the refurbished system and compare them to the standard specs 
for the product.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Another type of product that consumers will find discounted is an open box 
product. These differ from a refurbished product as it has not been rebuilt. It 
is simply a product that was returned by a customer but it has not been tested. 
Consumers should be very careful when purchasing any open box product.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Costs</h3> 
<p>Cost is the primary reason people purchase refurbished desktops and 
laptops. They are often priced below the average computer system currently 
sold. Of course the amount of discount is only really relevant if you happen to 
be looking at the same exact product. Most refurbished PCs available will 
typically be older products that are being compared to the original suggested 
retail prices for the product when it was first released. As a result, the 
deals may not always be the best.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When pricing a refurbished computer, it is important to note if the system 
is still available for sale new. If it is, this makes the price comparison very 
easy to determine. PCs such as this generally can be found for modest discounts 
of between 10 and 25% off the retail prices. As long as they have similar 
warranties to the new products these can be an excellent way to get a system 
for below retail.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The problem comes from older systems that are no longer sold. Consumers are 
often tricked into paying for a system that looks like a good deal but is not. 
This is where the specifications become extremely important. With those in 
hand, try to find a comparable brand new system. If one is available, then the 
same cost analysis of 10 to 25% still holds. If a comparable system is not 
available, then look for a comparably priced system and see what you get. Often 
times consumers in this case will find that for the same price they can get a 
better, newer laptop or desktop.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Warranties</h3> 
<p>The key to any refurbished computer system is the warranty. These are 
products that typically were returned or rejected due to a defect. While that 
defect may have been corrected and no further problems may develop you want to 
make sure that some coverage is included for potential faults. The problem is 
that warranties are typically modified for refurbished products.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>First and foremost, the warranty should be a manufacturer one. If the 
warranty is not provided by the manufacturer it should raise a red flag for 
consumers. A manufacturer warranty will guarantee that the system will be 
repaired to the original specifications with manufacturer parts or certified 
replacements can be used with the system. Third party warranties can cause 
major problems as replacements parts may not be guaranteed and it may take 
longer for the system to be repaired.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The next thing to look at is the length of the warranty. It should provide 
the same length as if it was purchased new. If the manufacturer is not offering 
the same coverage consumers should once again beware. The lower cost of the 
system may be the result of them not offering to support the product.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Finally, be wary of extended warranties. If an optional warranty is offered 
for purchase with the system, it should be a manufacturer extended warranty and 
not one through a third party. Also be wary of the cost for extended 
warranties. If the cost of the extended warranties makes the system cost more 
than buying it new, avoid the purchase.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Conclusions</h3> 
<p>Refurbished laptops and desktops are one way consumers can find a good 
deal, but they have to be much more informed before the purchase. The key is to 
ask several key questions to know if it is really a good and safe deal:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Is it sold by the manufacturer or a retailer?</li> 
<li>What is the price relative to the same PC new?</li> 
<li>Is the system comparable to an equivalent priced new PC?</li> 
<li>What type of warranty comes with the PC?</li> 
<li>Who will handle warranty work?</li> </ul> 
<p>If all of these can be answered satisfactorily, then consumers can 
generally feel secure in the purchase of a refurbished PC.</p>
