<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 9 2010</em> - HP has done an amazing job of 
storage functions and performance in the Pavilion dv7-4080us while keeping it 
affordable. The new brushed aluminum exterior gives it a nicer feel but it is 
the terabyte of storage space, Blu-ray drive and improved ATI graphics that 
make this system a good choice for just about any type of PC using. The biggest 
downside is the display panel that doesn't reach full 1080p resolutions but 
with a $1300 price tag that is a sacrifice many will accept. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<li>Lots of Storage Space</li> 
<li>Blu-ray Compatible Drive</li> 
<li>Improved Direct X 11 Graphics From Previous Version</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3>

<h3>Guide Review - HP Pavilion dv7-4080us 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop 
PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jul 9 2010</em> - HP has made some significant changes to its flagship 
Pavilion dv7 desktop replacement. Most notable of these is the new brushed 
aluminum exterior that gives the system a new look and feel. It is certainly a 
step up from the plastic employed by the majority of laptop manufacturers but 
it does fall short of HP's Envy line or Apple's MacBook Pro's.</p> 
<p>The overall performance of the HP Pavilion dv7-4080us hasn't changed much. 
Like its previous version, it comes equipped with a quad core Intel Core 
i7-720QM mobile processor paired up with 6GB of DDR3 memory. This lets the 
system power though just about any application that can be thrown at it 
including processor intensive desktop video work or PC gaming.</p> 
<p>Storage is what really sets the HP Pavilion apart from other desktop 
replacement laptops. Rather than using a single drive, HP has packed in two 
500GB hard drives to provide just under one terabyte of storage space. This 
provides roughly double what most desktop replacements in its price range 
provide giving more than enough space for programs, data and media files. The 
drives also spin at the faster 7200rpm desktop rate for quick data access. In 
addition to this, HP continues to include a Blu-ray combo drive that can 
playback Blu-ray movies or be used to playback and record CDs and DVDs.</p> 
<p>Graphics on the HP Pavilion dv7-4080us have been upgraded thanks to the use 
of the ATI Radeon Mobility HD 5650 graphics processor. This gives the new 
version full Direct X 11 capabilities for improved 3D graphics in modern games. 
The display panel unfortunately still retains the 1600x900 resolution. This 
means that it still can't fully display 1080p high definition video content 
from either Blu-ray or streaming. At least the new graphics can support the 
panel's resolution better than the previous version.</p> 
<p>HP has increased the size of the battery slightly from the previous 
version. The nine cell battery has helped push it to be slightly better than 
average. Blu-ray playback will yield roughly two and a half hours while DVD 
playback achieves nearly three. More traditional laptop usage adds about an 
extra hour which is above most system but still well short of Apple's MacBook 
Pro 17.</p> 
<p>While HP includes some useful software packages with their systems 
including MediaSmart, they tend to include a large number of less useful or 
trialware applications that clutter up the system. With all the space and 
performance, it doesn't slow things down much but it does still take up drive 
space and leave random shortcuts.</p> 
<p>HP has done an amazing job of features in the Pavilion dv7-4080us and kept 
the price down. It is possible to find the system for just under $1300 which is 
a good deal less than what many other companies are charging for a similar set 
of features.</p> <br>
