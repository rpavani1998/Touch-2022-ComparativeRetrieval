A look at the evolving laptop display Conclusion <br>
<br>

<br> <br>
 In July 2007, we wrote an assessment of the matte display in the 
MacBook Pro 15 inch. At the time, Apple was beginning the transition to LED 
backlights in its laptop line, and what we found was the display was 
incrementally better than the company's previous offerings in this size and 
offered a decent platform for assessing and doing basic adjusting of pictures 
in the field. In short, the screen was good and it responded well to hardware 
profiling but overall accuracy was a couple of notches below a good desktop 
display. Still, we concluded that Apple was making one of the finest laptop 
screens we'd seen for use in a pro digital photography workflow.<br>
<br>
 
Eighteen months have elapsed since then, and the laptop display landscape has 
changed plenty. Apple has switched to a glossy-only display design for most of 
its portable lineup, Lenovo has released a laptop with a screen calibrator 
built into the palmrest while netbooks have evolved into surprisingly useful 
tools for some types of photography. To that end, we've gathered and tested the 
displays in three current laptops: thelate-2008 MacBook Pro 15 inch, Lenovo 
ThinkPad W700 and Dell Inspiron Mini 9.<br>
<br>
 Well, make that four laptops. 
Rounding out the testing is theIBM/Lenovo ThinkPad T60, whose 1400 x 1050 pixel 
FlexView display has nearly a cult following among laptop afficionados. While 
discontinued - and not always readily available when it was still officially an 
option - this laptop's display is so well regarded by those outside the world 
of photography that when we needed to replace a Windows laptop in the fall of 
2007, we opted for this computer with this screen. If only to see what all the 
fuss was about.<br>

<br>

<br> What follows is an assessment of the screens in these four road machines, 
done in a manner similar to ourJuly 2007 report. We looked at a total of 81 
pictures, gathered over time to evaluate computer displays, both desktop and 
laptop. The photos themselves are a mix of black and white and colour, some 
with muted shades and some that are richly saturated, some that are moody and 
some that are high key. Several of the photos are in three different colour 
spaces - sRGB, Adobe RGB and ProPhoto RGB.<br>
<br>
 In all cases the displays 
were profiled with a monitor profiling package consisting of a colorimeter or 
spectrophotometer for screen measurements and software to create the profile. 
The profiling tools we used are described at the end of the article. The key 
point to remember for now is that we did all evaluations with a profile loaded 
that produced the best result, so that each display was putting its best foot 
forward.<br>
<br>
 Our reference monitor was an Eizo ColorEdge CE240W, a 
colour-accurate desktop monitor that has been an essential part of our photo 
viewing, editing and printing workflow for some time.<br>
<br>
Apple MacBook 
Pro 15 inch<br>
<br>
 Released in the fourth quarter of 2008, this computer's 
display incorporates an all-glass front designed to minimize flex in the lid. 
And that it does, as the lid is both impressively thin and impressively rigid. 
The rest of this portable computer is typical of the current Apple: it's sleek, 
skinny and beautiful to behold.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 Unfortunately, at least from a photographer's 
perspective, a few things were lost in the transition to the sleek new design, 
including a FireWire 400 port, one USB 2.0 port and a matte display option. 
Aperture and Photoshop CS4 users will appreciate the beefier graphics 
subsystem, while the keyboard and trackpad are nice. Outside of that, there's 
little in the way of real innovation in this model that specifically targets or 
benefits the field shooter.<br>
<br>
 But it's still a Mac. This means it's 
well put together and it runs the Mac OS plus various Mac-only applications, 
which for some - including us - is a benefit. This also means we needed to see 
if its glossy screen was both tolerable to use, profilable and at least on par 
with the quality of the previous generation MacBook Pro 15 inch. The result is 
a mix of good news and bad news.<br>
<br>
 Starting on a positive note, the 
display quality is comparable to what we've seen before in earlier editions of 
the LED-backlit MacBook Pro 15 inch. Screen brightness is impressively even, as 
is black and white photo rendering, while overall colour accuracy is decent. 
Deep shadow posterization, a common laptop screen problem, is present but kept 
to a minimum. The only significant colour error is in reds and oranges, which 
are considerably skewed in both hue and saturation and really don't look right 
on this display. Secondarily, and far less noticeable, are slight yellow and 
blue shifts in open shadows.<br>
<br>
 The above assumes a fixed, head-on 
viewing position. Gazing at the screen from a higher or lower angle produces a 
noticeable skin tone colour and brightness shift, while a yellow cast intrudes 
when looking in from the left or right.<br>
<br>
 Sum it up, and what you have 
is a very good 15.4 inch (diagonal), 1440 x 900 pixel screen. Good, that is, 
for a laptop. Its characteristics are very similar to the MacBook Pro 15 inch 
we wrote about in July 2007, and others we've set up since. The display has 
some colour quirks that put it one or two steps below a good desktop display, 
and it's important to maintain a consistent, front-and-centre viewing angle, 
but as with the previous generation of this Apple laptop, display quality is 
absolutely acceptable and usable for image assessment and simple Photoshop 
edits in the field, as long as you're aware of the display's particular blend 
of strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
 And as long as the ambient light is 
subdued. The glass sheet in front of the screen is about as reflective as it 
could be, which means that in a coffee shop, on an airplane or even a typical 
office, the glossiness is either a minor irritant or a major distraction, 
depending on the surroundings and your tolerance for screen reflections. During 
testing we used the late-2008 MacBook Pro 15 inch in all three environments, 
and that was enough to conclude that it's not for us. This is not the first 
glossy laptop display of this size we've used, but it's by far the most 
reflective.<br>
<br>
 If you roll your cursor over the photo below, you'll see 
an example of this in an environment that rates as only mildly reflective, and 
the resulting reflections are at the minor irritant level. In an airplane with 
a mix of window shades open and closed, for example, the reflections become 
much worse, obscuring sections of not just darker photos but all photos, as 
well as the Photoshop panels and other interface elements around the periphery. 
It's a major distraction.<br>

Galbraith/Little Guy Media) <br>
<br>
<br>
 All in all, the late-2008 MacBook 
Pro 15 inch has a decent, profilable display, much like the previous generation 
of this model, but is marred by an omnipresent glare from its mirror-like front.
<br> <br>
Note: Some online sleuthing turns up the fact that Apple may be 
sourcing display panels for this Mac from more than one manufacturer. The panel 
in the unit we tested is model &quot;9C84&quot; (as described in the metadata 
of its default monitor profile), while there are apparently units of the same 
Mac with &quot;9C85&quot; panels. Do these two different panels also differ in 
display quality and profilability? We don't know.<br>
<br>
 If you must have 
this computer, or you've already taken the plunge and find that you can't get 
comfortable with its ultraglossy display, you may wish to investigate
TechRestore's matte screen alternative. The U.S.-based computer repair outfit's 
US$199 service sees the glass front removed and the glossy panel underneath 
replaced with a matte panel and bezel surround. We saw the result, nicknamed 
the MatteBook Pro by the company, earlier this month at the Macworld Expo trade 
show in San Francisco, and it looks really well done. A representative said 
that the matte panel they swap in is the same as the one they take out, except 
for the glossy finish (though this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the 
display's characteristics will be an exact match or that it will respond the 
same way to profiling). A lower-tech option is a matte screen protector, such as
Anti-Glare Film from Power Support.<br>
<br>
Dell Inspiron Mini 9<br>
<br>
 We 
ordered this netbook a couple of months ago because it was the right size, 
weight and price to tote along on remote camera installations, where a laptop 
can be an invaluable tool in confirming that the wireless link is a-ok, that 
the camera is positioned and configured correctly and so on. But it can be a 
pain, if not downright impractical on occasion, to drag along a full-size 
laptop for this.<br>
<br>
 When the Inspiron Mini 9 arrived, it quickly became 
clear it was going to be useful for a lot more than setting up remotes. This 
pint-sized wonder has sufficient oomph for a variety of tasks, and once we got 
it outfitted with 2GB RAM and a 32GB SSD it has become a constant companion 
that we've used to import, select and transmit JPEGs, edit short video clips 
plus the usual netbook stuff like email, web browsing and even video chats 
using the built-in camera.<br>
<br>
 Its 1.6GHz Intel Atom-series processor 
chokes on RAW conversions - it'll do them, if you're really patient - but for 
photo browsing and basic image editing steps the performance is okay. Rounding 
out this featherweight computer are three USB ports (which are fast for USB in 
our testing), 802.11g Wi-Fi, 10/100 Ethernet, VGA monitor out and Bluetooth. 
The only truly bothersome feature of the Mini 9 that's brought about by its 
small size has been the cramped keyboard, and that's mostly because of the odd 
placement of the right Shift key.<br>
<br>
 To have a computer this capable, 
that is also small enough and light enough to slip into pretty much any camera 
bag, it has been a workflow-altering experience. Thanks in part to the Mini 9, 
I've personally switched to using theThink Tank Photo Streetwalker Pro for 
light duty gear carrying. As you can see in the photo below, the diminutive 
Dell slips easily into this compact, narrow photo backpack and leaves plenty of 
room for a carry-about camera kit (the Mini 9 is on the left side of the bag in 
the photo on the right).<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 Our infatuation with the Mini 9 
extends to its 8.9 inch (diagonal), 1024 x 600 pixel, LED-backlit display. For 
a computer that starts at about US$300 in the U.S. right now, we had modest 
expectations. As it turns out, the display profiles well, neutrals are 
reasonably neutral with minimal colour shifting in whites, grays or blacks and 
overall colour accuracy is very good for a laptop. Overall hue accuracy, in 
fact, is better than the late-2008 MacBook Pro 15 inch.<br>
<br>
 The only real 
colour hangups are oversaturated reds and oranges, including skin tones to some 
extent, plus there's a slight pink shift in lighter reds. Some shadow 
posterization is visible too, but it's not significant. All in all, this 
display is delivering more quality than one could reasonably hope for from a 
machine in this price class.<br>
<br>
 You won't see the fairly rosy picture 
being described above unless you're looking straight at the screen. The Mini 
9's optimum viewing position is the only position in which you get the screen's 
full goodness. Bad things happen when the viewing angle shifts up, down, left 
or right, with the up/down angles bringing about big brightness and colour 
shifts. The left/right viewing angles are more forgiving, to a point; exceed a 
certain angle and image reversal kicks in. There is also some unevenness in 
brightness top to bottom, though this is mitigated by the fact the screen isn't 
terribly tall.<br>
<br>
 Other than the restrictive viewing position, the only 
other sign the Mini 9 contains an inexpensive panel is the pronounced ghosting 
when moving windows around. This doesn't, however, impact how photos look on 
the display (nor does it impair the watching of movies).<br>
<br>
 Like the 
late-2008 MacBook Pro 15 inch, the Mini 9's display is glossy, and it's not 
available in a matte surface. The small size of the screen, and its 
comparatively duller glossiness, means that reflections are less of a problem. 
That's understating it: most of the time we're not even aware of its gloss, let 
alone bothered by it.<br>
<br>
 The Mini 9 is a low-budget gem for a number of 
reasons, including its photography-friendly LED-backlit display.<br>
<br>

IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad T60<br>
<br>
 The ThinkPad series from Lenovo is their 
business laptop line. Trouble is, somebody forgot to mention that to the 
designers, because both the T60, and the W700 discussed next, incorporate 
displays geared to pro photography. In its heyday back in 2006-2007, the T60 
could be configured with a 14.1 inch, 1400 x 1050 pixel, matte-surface FlexView 
display featuring in-plane switching (IPS) panel technology.<br>
<br>
 Why does 
the panel technology matter? Briefly, there are three broad categories of LCD 
panel types: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA, and variants like 
PVA and MVA) and IPS. Each has different strengths, with IPS panels generally 
providing good colour reproduction and the widest viewing angles. We know of no 
IPS screens in current-model laptops, ThinkPads or otherwise, and it's a shame, 
because our T60's FlexView display has some killer attributes. They include:<br>
<ul> 
<li> Even screen brightness There is slight darkening in the upper corners, 
otherwise it's about as even from edge to edge as a better quality desktop 
display.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Nearly perfect neutrals Our Eizo ColorEdge 240W is almost entirely free 
of noticeable colour casts from black to white, and the T60's FlexView display 
nearly matches the Eizo. It's easily the best laptop screen we've encountered 
for viewing black-and-white photos.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Wide, wide viewing angle Like all laptop displays, this one has a viewing 
position sweet spot. Move your head a bit away from that sweet spot and photos 
appear darker and flatter. But only slightly, the shift is quite subtle. Move 
your head far away from the sweet spot and photos retain their slightly darker 
and slightly flatter appearance. In fact, looking from the extreme left, 
extreme right or practically straight down, the onscreen appearance of a 
picture doesn't really change from being slightly darker and slightly flatter 
than the straight-on view. Trying placing a print in front your laptop's 
display, then viewing that from a variety of angles, and you'll have an idea of 
how wide this display's viewing angle is. It's really cool.</li> </ul> Colour 
accuracy is also very good, but not quite at the level of the three attributes 
listed above. That's for one reason: reds are much too saturated, by 
approximately 20 points or so in some photos. Also, we're not sure how much 
longer this monitor is going to deliver the goods. That's because maximum 
screen luminance, which was at about 180 cd/m2 when we got it, has already 
faded to about 135cd/m2, and once it dips below about 110 cd/m2 it will be 
getting too dim to be usable for accurate photo viewing in anything other than 
low ambient light.<br>
<br>
 Overall, the ThinkPad T60's 1400 x 1050 pixel 
FlexView display is sweet, and it set a new standard in laptop displays in its 
time. A purchase of a used T60 equipped with this same display, however, may 
not be the best idea, unless you can find one with a backlight that hasn't 
faded much.<br>
<br>
Lenovo ThinkPad W700<br>
<br>
 Last but definitely not 
least is the ThinkPad W700. The W700 is Lenovo's effort to create a notebook 
computer that would have the key features photographers told them they wanted, 
from fast RAW conversions to a built-in CompactFlash reader and everything 
in-between.<br>
<br>
 And Lenovo has delivered: the W700 is a powerful photo 
processing machine that, when tricked out with all the options, includes a 
2.53GHz Intel Core 2 Quad Extreme processor, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA Quadro FX 3700M 
graphics, 17 inch (diagonal), 1920 x 1200 pixel, matte-surface display with 
dual fluorescent (CCFL) backlights, twin RAID-configured hard drives, three 
video out ports (VGA, Dual-Link DVI and DisplayPort), CompactFlash slot, 
ExpressCard 34 slot, a miniature Wacom tablet and a custom HueyPro calibrator 
in the palmrest. The W700ds variant adds a 10.6 inch, 768 x 1280 pixel 
LED-backlit second display that slides out from behind the main one.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
 It sounds like a photographer's dream come true. But be careful 
what you wish for: by giving photographers almost everything on their wish 
list, Lenovo has created a PC that is so darned big it seriously stretches the 
definition of a portable computer. Some wide angle perspective distortion in 
the photo leading off this article underplays its size. A truer photo of the 
ThinkPad W700 is below, with a Mini 9 for scale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Goliath: The Dell Inspiron Mini 9 on top of the Lenovo ThinkPad W700 (Photo by

<br>
<br>
 This is a computer to enjoy in 
the office, hotel room or at the event, but is too unwieldy for use on most 
planes, trains and automobiles that you might take to travel to these places. 
The ThinkPad W700 is the antithesis of the Mini 9.<br>
<br>
 So yes, we're not 
crazy about the size. Whatever criticisms we have about that, however, melt 
away when the computer is switched on and a photo is opened across its 17 inch 
display. Unlike every other laptop we've ever looked at, the W700 shows no 
significant colour accuracy errors at all, is only a touch less neutral through 
white, grey and black than the T60 FlexView and reveals just a hint of deep 
shadow posterization. Overall colour accuracy is on par with a fine desktop 
display.<br>
<br>
 Coaxing the display to give this level of accuracy is 
simple, thanks to the built-in Pantone calibrator (which is an embedded version 
of a Huey colorimeter utilizing a custom filter set tuned to the W700 display). 
Profiling is as easy as launching the included hueyPro application, closing the 
lid, waiting 70 seconds for three short beeps to signal the end of the 
measurement process, opening the lid, choosing a colour temperature and gamma 
and that's it. From the time you think of profiling the display to the time 
you're done is three minutes, tops.<br>
<br>
 As you'll read in the testing 
notes section ahead, we worked through a handful of monitor profiling packages 
with each computer. We set out to do the same with the W700, but once we saw 
how good the results were from the built-in Huey we couldn't think of a 
compelling enough reason to continue. The calibrator is a US$70 option. It's 
worth all of that and more.<br>
<br>
 The screen is also exceptionally sharp. 
This is explained partly by its 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution; that's a lot of 
pixels to stuff into a 17 inch (diagonal) display, which means each pixel is 
particularly small. Its contrastiness is also a contributing factor. But 
there's something else good going on in this display that makes sharp pictures 
and text look especially edgy. The Mini 9 and ThinkPad T60 also have sharp 
displays, while the late-2008 MacBook Pro 15 inch's display is slightly softer. 
All three, however, don't look as superbly crisp as the W700.<br>
<br>
 The 
W700's display is really, really good, but it's not perfect. We've not been 
able to find out what kind of panel it uses, but Wes Williams, Worldwide 
ThinkPad Product Marketing Manager at Lenovo, was able to tell us what it's 
not: IPS. This probably partly explains the areas in which it trails the T60's 
FlexView display, including:<br>

<ul> 
<li> Screen unevenness The W700's display darkens noticeably in the upper 
corners, and has an overly light strip that runs almost the full width of the 
lower edge. For evenness, this display is average at best.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Colour shifts with viewing angle Changing your head position up or down 
brings about an obvious change in skin tones (and anything else in the 
red/yellow/orange range), while a yellowy-red cast intrudes when looking at the 
screen from the extreme left or right. That said, the colour shifts in this 
screen brought on by a change in viewing angle we'd rank as being less than 
most, even if the T60's FlexView display is better.</li> </ul>The W700 has many 
fine features for photographers, but the standout feature is the combination of 
its display and easy-to-use embedded calibrator (we say more about the 
calibrator and its software in the testing notes section on the next page).<br>

<br> Note: the W700 is available with either a standard 17 inch display (called 
17&quot; WXGA+ LCD 200 NIT on Lenovo's order pages) or the twin-backlight 
premium one we tested (which goes by 17&quot; WUXGA 400NIT TFT). Also note that 
we haven't tested the slide-out second screen of the W700ds.<br>
