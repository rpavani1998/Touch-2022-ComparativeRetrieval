<h1>Laptop or Desktop?</h1> 
<p>Laptops were once bulky devices that could barely be deemed 
&ldquo;portable.&rdquo; But then again, desktops once took up entire rooms. 
Every aspect of computers and the Internet is becoming smaller, more mobile, 
and easier to handle. As such, while it can hardly be called an age old 
question, the choice between a laptop and a desktop is an important one.</p> 
<p>Advantages of a Desktop</p> 
<p>A desktop computer is certainly the classic choice, and most people who use 
computers will be more used to this option. While the size can sometimes work 
against it, desktops are also a solid choice for a number of reasons. They 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cost. Desktops are cheaper than laptops with similar specs.</li> 
<li>Power. Desktops have better technical specs overall.</li> 
<li>Cooling. It&rsquo;s easier to keep a desktop from overheating.</li> 
<li>Upgrades. You can upgrade the components of a desktop far more easily.</li>
<li>Repairs. Desktops are easier and cheaper to repair.</li> </ul> 
<p>Advantages of a Laptop</p> 
<p>Laptops once had greater limitations on their capabilities, but thanks to 
mobile internet access and the boom ofsocial media software, you can now do all 
of your necessary work while on the go. While a bit pricier, advantages of a 
laptop include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mobility. You can take the laptop with you on the go without any issues.
</li> 
<li>Space. You can use a laptop on a bus, airplane, or a hotel lobby.</li> 
<li>Web access. Thanks to wireless technologies, you can now access the 
Internet from almost anywhere with a laptop computer.</li> 
<li>Cordless life. With the battery life for some laptops now reaching as much 
as ten hours, you can go cordless for long periods of time.</li> </ul> 
<p>Neither of these options are right for everyone. With distinct advantages, 
each selection is meant for a target market that requires something different. 
Simply consider the pros and cons before making your final decision.</p> <br>
