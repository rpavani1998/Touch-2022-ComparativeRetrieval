<h2><strong>iland puts desktop in the cloud, enables security and mobility
</strong></h2> 
<h3><strong>The iland Workforce Cloud allows secure desktop connections to 
corporate data while supporting disaster recovery, business continuity, and 
compliance.</strong></h3> <strong>HOUSTON, TX &ndash; September 16, 2009
</strong> &ndash; iland&trade; announced today the general availability of the 
iland Workforce Cloud&copy;, a unified platform that integrates desktop PCs, 
laptops and other devices with hosted servers, data, and services. The unified 
solution allows secure desktop connections to hosted corporate data via the 
iland Workforce Cloud, which is supported by six existing iland 
high-availability, cloud-computing datacenters located in North America and 
Europe.<br>
 &nbsp;  &quot;With the iland Workforce Cloud, we extend the 
benefits of cloud computing to the desktop environment,&quot; explains Scott 
Sparvero, iland CEO. &quot;We create a seamless, secure, cloud infrastructure 
solution that closes the loop between the desktop and the datacenter.&quot;  
&nbsp;  The iland Workforce Cloud also delivers easy, secure access for 
traveling or telecommuting workers while offering organizations the benefits of 
business continuity as well as simplified management. Because employee data is 
stored in the iland Workforce Cloud&mdash;not in a PC or vulnerable 
laptop&mdash;data is safe even if devices are stolen or destroyed. Restoring a 
user&rsquo;s desktop to a new machine can be done in minutes.  &nbsp;  &quot; 
Disaster recovery is a key feature because solutions for desktops can be costly 
and complex,&quot; says Sparvero. &quot;But with our integrated infrastructure 
solution, the Workforce Cloud enables businesses to extend enterprise-class 
features to the desktop such as high availability, disaster recovery, and 
business continuity. By backing-up desktops in our datacenter, businesses also 
benefit from greater fault-tolerance and reliability while providing higher 
levels of availability to their end users.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;  In addition to 
providing workforce mobility and data protection, the iland Workforce Cloud 
allows companies to simplify desktop management by creating standardized disk 
images that can be deployed, configured, and migrated centrally. This liberates 
IT staff from one-at-a-time fixes and allows them to spend more time supporting 
strategic business priorities.  &nbsp;  &quot;The iland Workforce Cloud lets us 
deliver cost-effective enterprise computing to everyone,&rdquo; continues 
Sparvero. &ldquo;Our solution reduces total IT expenditures for desktops and 
laptops since any device with a web browser or client can be 
used?&mdash;including dumb terminals. The iland Workforce Cloud also allows 
businesses to reduce capital expenditures since it turns IT spending into a 
predictable operational expense paid on a monthly basis, including the ability 
to lease all the OS licenses from iland.&rdquo; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>  With centralized control over desktops and laptops, the iland 
Workforce Cloud is ideal for auditing, control, reporting, and compliance 
purposes for businesses with five or more desktops. Hosting of servers, 
applications, and data provides a completecloud computing solution for an 
entire office environment. End-users experience better application performance 
compared to single-disk desktops and can access their virtual desktops securely 
from any internet connection. The iland Workforce Cloud is also a viable 
solution for resellers, helpdesks, and outsourced IT firms, allowing them to 
effectively support applications and desktops remotely.<br>
