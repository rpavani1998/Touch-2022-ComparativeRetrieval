<p><b> PowerBook Mystique Review - Kensington Laptop Desktop USB Laptop Stand 
</b> <br>
<b>by Charles W. Moore </b> </p>
<p>One of the most interesting and innovative laptop stand alternatives in an 
increasingly crowded field is the Kensington Laptop Desktop USB laptop 
stand-cum-USB docking station.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>Genuinely unique and original in concept, the attractively styled Laptop 
Desktop USB has no pretensions of being a portable laptop accessory, measuring 
15.0&quot; x 4.5&quot; x 12.25&quot; in its most compactly folded mode, and 
weighing about four pounds by my rough estimate. It is intended as a desktop 
docking station to convert your laptop into a desktop substitute with a 
comfortable screen viewing height and for use with an external keyboard and 
pointing device. The built-in 4-port USB 2.0 compatible hub provides convenient 
one-time connection for peripheral devices, allowing you to leave your 
keyboard, mouse, printer, and so forth plugged into the stand/dock unit with 
just one USB plug to disconnect for quick conversion of your 'Book back to 
portable or road warrioring mode. A five volt power supply is included.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>Named by CES 2005 as an Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase honoree 
in the Computer Accessories category, this laptop-to-desktop solution will also 
be featured in Wayport's Laptop Lane business airport centers across the 
country.</p>
<p>&quot;With the growth of notebook sales continuing at a rapid pace, it's 
clear that consumers are seeking solutions for going from mobile to stationary 
quickly and easily, while allowing them to claim back their home and office 
desks,&quot; says Don Angel, Kensington's VP of Product Development.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a pure desktop device is amplified by there being no 
immediate access to the laptop's built-in keyboard or trackpad when the 
computer is docked in the Laptop Desktop USB. The computer sleeve's front panel 
obscures the keyboard from view or access with the machine inserted. This could 
be a mixed blessing in certain circumstances, such as system freezes that put 
the external input devices out of action, but it is a relatively simple matter 
to pull the laptop out of the sleeve in order to manipulate the keyboard if 
necessary.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>More problematical with certain 'Books will be the lack of access to front 
mounted optical drives, as in the TiBook and the 15 inch and 17-inch aluminum 
PowerBooks. However, it isn't an issue with my iBook, or Pismo and WallStreet 
G3 PowerBooks, all of which have side-mounted optical drives, as does the 
12&quot; PowerBook. It's not terribly difficult to pop the computer out of the 
sleeve to insert a CD or DVD in a front-mounted drive once in a while, but it 
could get very old if you use your optical drive a lot.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>The rationale behind the solid front panel is that it will protect the 
laptop from spills and dust, and it also facilitates one of the the Laptop 
Desktop USB's neatest features -- a handy clipboard-type copy holder that can 
keep a paper document front and center while you copy it by typing or 
dictation. I found this extremely convenient, as I usually draft articles 
longhand and then dictate them using iListen or ViaVoice software. No more 
makeshift propping up limp sheets of paper!</p>
<p></p> 
<p>With its 3 to 45 degree range of tilt, the Laptop Desktop USB has no 
difficulty setting the laptop screen at an ergonomically sound level. The 
lowest position is 14.6&quot;L X 5.0&quot;H X 11.6&quot;W, and the highest 
position 11.6&quot;L X 9.5&quot;H X 11.6&quot;W. Adjusting the tilt angle is 
simple and slick. Just press the large hinge-release button on the right-hand 
side of the unit, use your other hand to adjust the laptop sleeve to the 
desired height, and release the button. Just takes a few seconds.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>The Laptop Desktop USB rests on a 360 degree swiveling turntable, which 
makes it easy to &quot;pan&quot; the docked laptop's screen for better viewing 
from another angle or for access to its connection ports. The blue cushion that 
contacts the bottom of your laptop is soft, as are two blue contact buttons on 
the sleeve top.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>The four-port USB hub module is located at the rear base of the unit, and 
the connector cord and plug for the laptop pull out of a storage pod on the 
underside of the laptop sleeve. You only need pull out as much cord as 
necessary to reach a USB report on the laptop, but there is plenty available to 
reach around to the side mounted ports on iBooks and aluminum PowerBooks. One 
suggestion: since this is a true desktop dock, just four USB ports seems a bit 
stingy. There is plenty of room for more. Why not six or eight?</p>
<p></p> 
<p>Kensington specifies 16 inch or smaller as being that the laptop sizes 
officially supported by this product, but I don't see any obvious reason why 
the 17-inch PowerBook wouldn't work with the Laptop Desktop USB, so long as you 
don't mind the aesthetics of the keyboard-flanking &quot;wings&quot; protruding 
from either side of sleeve. The Laptop Desktop USB handled my big WallStreet 
PowerBook (which weighs more than eight pounds, but has only a 12.1-inch 
display) with no problem, and the 17-inch aluminum PowerBook is lighter than 
the WallStreet.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>The Laptop Desktop USB also addresses the laptop cooling issue. The back 
panel of the laptop sleeve is curved to &quot;belly&quot; away from the bottom 
of the computer, allowing air to circulate and cool the machine by convection.
</p>
<p>While the Kensington Laptop Desktop USB is primarily a desktop device, but 
the laptop sleeve component of the Laptop Desktop USB can be unfastened from 
its base by removing four screws, and attached to a standard VESA monitor arm, 
cubicle hanger, or wall mount, enhancing the versatility of this interesting 
product.</p>
<p>The Kensington Laptop Desktop USB is nicely finished and appears to be 
well-constructed. The hinge apparatus works smoothly, the clipboard copy stand 
feature is clever, and little touches like the clip that holds the USB 
connector cable neatly without hanging or flopping are evidence of thoughtful 
design and attention to detail. At $79.95, the Kensington Laptop Desktop USB 
isn't the cheapest Laptop stand solution, but it's not the most expensive 
either, and when you factor in the four-port USB hub, it's really a bit of a 
bargain. There's nothing else quite like it on the market.</p>
<p>Features and benefits in summary: <br>
