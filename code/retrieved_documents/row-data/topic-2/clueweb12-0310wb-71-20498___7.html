<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 13 2011</em> - HP's Pavilion dv7-6185us is a 
serious alternative to the Envy series for those wanting high performance but 
not necessarily using it for gaming. The Intel Core i7 quad core processor and 
6GB of memory allow it to handle even tough tasks such as desktop video. 
Storage is superb with a large hard drive, Blu-ray compatible drive and two USB 
3.0 ports for expansion. HP has even moved back to a traditional trackpad from 
the poorly received unified version. All-in-all, it is a solid improvement but 
HP still could cut back on the number of preinstalled applications but keeping 
the unified color scheme of past models instead of the two tone of black and 
metal. Buy Direct <br>

<h3>Guide Review - HP Pavilion dv7-6185us 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop 
PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jul 13 2011</em> - HP's Pavilion dv7 may not be quite up to their Envy 
series of performance laptops but that doesn't prevent HP from offering some 
very solid performance in the dv7-6185us. In this case, it comes with an Intel 
Core i7-2630QM quad core processor that offers a high level of performance for 
those looking to do some serious computing including desktop video work. In 
addition to this, they support 6GB of DDR3 memory that allows it to run 
smoothly through most applications or when multitasking.</p> 
<p>Storage features are the strongest aspect of the HP Pavilion dv7-6185us. It 
starts out with a very large hard drive with a 750GB capacity. This seems to be 
the new standard for those laptops that want to have a lot of space for 
applications, data and media files. In addition to this, HP also includes a 
Blu-ray compatible drive that allows the system to playback high definition 
Blu-ray movies. The drive also has the ability to playback or record to CD and 
DVD media. If that isn't enough for your, the laptop also features two USB 3.0 
super speed peripheral ports for use with high speed external storage.</p> 
<p>With HP focusing the Pavilion dv7 as an entertainment laptop, the display 
and graphics are some key features to consider. The 17.3-inch display offers a 
fairly typical 1600x900 resolution found in many laptops of this size. It would 
have been nice to see something that could fully support 1080p high definition 
resolutions especially since it comes with a Blu-ray drive but it is to be 
expected. Colors and viewing angles are pretty typical and the glossy display 
does make it difficult to use outside. The graphics are driven by the AMD 
Radeon HD 6490M graphics with 1GB of memory. This is a modest 3D graphics 
processor that can be used for casual gaming at lower resolutions and detail 
levels. Serious gamers would be better served by the Envy series from HP. It 
uses a hybrid graphics system that will use the Intel HD Graphics system built 
into the processor when the dedicated graphics is not required in order to 
conserve battery power. One other feature that laptop has is the ability to use 
a WiDi compatible box to stream the display to an external HDTV or monitor.</p> 
<p>With the Pavilion dv7-6185us, HP retains the aluminum shell that has been 
seen in previous versions but they have mixed up the colors a bit more by 
having a dark black lid and keyboard deck for the case. It doesn't have the 
same level of quality as the Envy series but is a step up from the traditional 
plastics found in most consumer laptops. The keyboard remains the same as in 
past models with the isolated layout but thankfully HP has redesigned the 
trackpad. While the past model used a unified button design, this one returns 
to the traditional right and left mouse button which greatly increases the 
accuracy of clicking.</p> 
<p>While most consumer laptops come equipped with a six-cell battery pack, HP 
is packing a nine-cell battery with a surprisingly high 100WHr rating. This is 
even higher than Apple's MacBook Pro that claims upwards of seven hours running 
time. In DVD playback testing, it was able to run for roughly three and a 
quarter hours before going into standby mode. Blu-ray playback will likely 
yield a little more than three while more traditional usage should yield over 
five hours. This is very long for a 17-inch Windows based laptop but still 
falls short of what Apple can achieve.</p> Buy Direct <br>
