<h3>Microsoft&rsquo;s SyncToy Keeps Data Safe and Handy</h3> Monday, April 
30th, 2012 
<p>Do you have a need to frequently access folders and files on a laptop or 
other computer that is not turned on 24/7? If this is you, you&rsquo;ll know 
that you usually have to turn on the laptop and wait for it to boot to a state 
that allows you to access the data. This could be as quick as two minutes or as 
long as 10 minutes, depending on the age of your hardware. Even worse, if your 
battery is low and no ac power is available to plug in the laptop you may have 
to wait even longer.</p> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to wait anymore, there is a solution to your data 
accessibility problems! You can copy those folders and files to a usb memory 
stick and, not only will you be able to access to the data from another 
computer, you will also have a &ldquo;live&rdquo; backup just in case something 
ever happens. On a small memory stick with a small amount of data it is 
possible to perform the data copy operations and keep the data synchronized 
manually. As your data grows however, the process will eventually become 
difficult to manage in an effective way. Just the need to answer 
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to every overwrite dialog could make a 
regular copy operation turn into a nightmare.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, Microsoft provides a free tools called SyncToy which will help 
minimize the time it takes to keep files in sync between folder pairs on your 
laptop and thumb drive. Download SyncToy here:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155</p> 
<p>You will need the proper download based on your existing operating system, 
your choices are x64 or x32 bit versions. To find out what version you need, 
click Start, right click on the computer icon, and select Properties. Half way 
down the page you&rsquo;ll see the &ldquo;System&rdquo; Header, now find 
&ldquo;System Type&rdquo; and look to see if your system requires 32-bit or 
64-bit software. Download and install SyncToy then run it, which will bring up 
the following screen:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To begin, you need to create a folder pair. This pair is how SyncToy 
manages keeping your files syncronized between the left and right folders. When 
you click on the Create Folder Pair button you start the process of joining the 
folder pairs. It is easiest if you browse to the location for each pair:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For this example we will use a &ldquo;Test&rdquo; folder with the 
&ldquo;left&rdquo; folder on the local hard drive and the &ldquo;right&rdquo; 
folder on a thumb drive. If a folder does not exist on the right folder 
destination, SyncToy allows you to create the folder as needed. Once you have 
folders set, you will be given a choice to Synchronize, Echo, or Contribute. 
For most applications you should Synchronize. You should carfully consider each 
option to get the best result. Here are the definitions of the options.</p> 
<p>Synchronize: New and updated files are copied both ways. Renames and 
deletes on either side are repeated on the other.</p> 
<p>Echo: New and updated files are copied left to right. Renames and deletes 
on the left are repeated on the right.</p> 
<p>Contribute: New and updated files are copied left to right. Renames on the 
left are repeated on the right. No deletions.</p> 
<p>Choose your Sync</p> 
<p>Now name your pair. This should be a simple name, yet descriptive of the 
pair.</p> 
<p>Name your pair</p> 
<p>That is all there is to creating folder pairs:</p> 
<p>The First Pair</p> 
<p>The simpler you keep your pairs, the easier it will be to maintain them. 
Now you simply need to run the pair(s) as needed, or put them on a schedule, 
but that is a topic for a future blog post.</p>

<h3>Destroy a Hard Drive &ndash; the Cheap and Easy Method</h3> Saturday, 
November 26th, 2011 
<p>A hard drive is a small box inside of computer equipment that may contain 
sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, 
social security numbers, etc. If you are upgrading to a new computer (desktop 
computer, laptop, office copier, etc.)<strong>always remove and destroy the 
hard drive before selling, donating, or recycling any computer equipment!
</strong> Failure to destroy the hard drive before giving the computer away 
could result in sensitive information ending up in the hands of the new owner, 
who will then be able to copy old files and go through your personal 
information stored there.</p> 
<p>There are many options available if you are looking to dispose of an old 
hard drive. Some professional destruction methods include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shredding it using a local shredding company</li> 
<li>Taking it to a computer recycling company</li> 
<li>Mailing it to a hard drive destruction specialist</li> 
<li>Bringing it in to a local computer shop that will dispose of it</li> </ul> 
<p>These methods are ideal, but they usually cost money. Professional 
destruction of a hard drive could cost $70 or more in some areas! So what is a 
low cost method to dispose of the hard drive and keep your personal data safe 
if you are low on funds? Considering you have all the right tools, this method 
won&rsquo;t cost you a dime and is a very secure way to get rid of a hard drive 
while keeping your data secure.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 1: Wipe it!</strong> Wiping a hard drive in essence destroys 
the data by writing over it with random characters. There are many free 
utilities to help, a good one is Active@ KillDisk. You can download the free 
utility from their website, click:Active@ KillDisk. This free software 
overwrites all of the data on your old hard drive with random characters and 
WILL DESTROY ALL OF YOUR DATA! Be sure you have performed a complete backup and 
have transferred the data from your old hard drive to your new system before 
wiping it.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2: Remove it!</strong> Physically remove the hard drive from 
the system. This is usually the easy part, you&rsquo;ll just need a screwdriver 
and a little patience. Keep in mind that you will still be able to sell or 
donate the old computer without a hard drive missing, just be sure to let the 
new owners know in advance that they will need a new hard drive and operating 
system.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 3: Drill it!</strong> If you plan on using the old hard drive 
again, skip this step. Otherwise it&rsquo;s best to physically destroy the old 
hard drive just to be 100% certain that the old data is completely destroyed. 
This step is not only fun, depending on how much personal data you had on the 
old drive it can also help you sleep better at night.</p> 
<p>Wearing protective goggles, gloves, and a dust mask for your mouth and nose 
take a drill and a metal drill bit to the drive. You&rsquo;ll want to drill 
through the drive completely from one side to the other, and you&rsquo;ll want 
to do this multiple times. Two important areas for you to drill through are the 
platters and the controller board. See examples in the below images.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Hard drive from an old computer, data already moved to new computer and 
ready for destruction.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> A few things you should have. Drill bits, eye protection, gloves, mouth 
and nose protection.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> A drill </dd> </dl> <br>

<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Hard drives contain many round platters inside that store the data. Drill 
through them.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> In this example, the drive has been drilled through one side to the 
other. You can see the light behind it coming through.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Close up of the hole drilled through the hard drive </dd> </dl> <br>

<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> The green area is the controller board. Drill through that as well. </dd> 
</dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Don&rsquo;t stop with just one hole, drill several times through the 
drive.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> The last hard drive was a 3.5&Prime; desktop drive. You can drill 
2.5&Prime; laptop hard drives the same way.</dd> </dl> <br>

<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> This laptop hard drive has a much larger controller board on the bottom, 
but is easier to drill through.</dd> </dl> 
<dl> 
<dt> </dt> 
<dd> Multiple drill holes through a 2.5&Prime; laptop hard drive </dd> </dl> 
<br> 
<p><strong>All done!</strong></p>
