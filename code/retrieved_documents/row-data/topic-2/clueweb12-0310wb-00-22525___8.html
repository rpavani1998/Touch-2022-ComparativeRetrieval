7/16/07 &ndash; Alienware made a name for themselves by building PC systems 
specifically for gaming. With the introduction of the Area-51 m9750 desktop 
replacement notebook, they are looking to push their way back to the top of the 
mobile PC gaming world. Let's take a close look at what they have to offer ... 
<h3>Processor:</h3>  Alienware's Area-51 m9750 is all about gaming 
performance. As such, they offer a variety of high performance Intel Core 2 Duo 
processors to power the system. The T5500 processor is the base which offers 
decent overall performance but with only 2MB of cache. For those looking for 
more performance, the T7200, T7400 or T7600 with its 4MB of cache would be the 
preferred choices. 
<h3>Memory:</h3>  In order to get the best performance possible, Alienware 
offers PC2-5300 DDR2 memory to match the 667MHz frontside bus of the Intel Core 
2 Duo processor that come in the m9750. Three memory configurations of 1GB, 2GB 
or 4GB are offered for the system. The standard configuration is 2GB with 4GB 
for those needing the most memory and 1GB for those trying to cut costs. 
<h3>Hard Drives:</h3>  A large number of hard drive options are available with 
the Area-51 m9750. A total of six different drives are available that can be 
purchases as single drive or two drive RAID 0 or RAID 1 configurations. In 
terms of the drive capacities, users can select between 80GB, 100GB, 160GB, 
200GB and 250GB capacities. Some of the drives feature a 5400rpm spin rate 
while others have 7200rpm for increased performance. 
<h3>CD/DVD Drive:</h3>  While most notebook and desktop PCs come standard with 
a DVD burner, Alienware actually offers users the base of a 24x CD-RW/DVD combo 
drive. Users will want to upgrade to the DVD burner as there is really no 
reason not to have the ability to burn DVDs. For those wanting high definition 
video support, there is also the option of a BluRay burner that also supports 
DVD burning. 
<h3>Graphics and Displays:</h3>  Since the Area-51 m9750 is built for gaming, 
the graphics and display are critical. The systems name is derived from the 
GeForce Go 7950 GTX 512MB graphics card that is standard. Users who want even 
more performance can elect to have a second graphics processor installed in an 
SLI configuration. In terms of the display, the system features one of two 
17&rdquo; LCD panels. For those looking at a single graphics core, the 1440x900 
screen is probably the better choice while the SLI configurations are better 
suited towards driving games on the 1920x1200 screen. An optional TV Tuner 
module is also available. 
<h3>Networking:</h3>  Every configuration of the Alienware Area-51 m9750 comes 
equipped with a Gigabit Ethernet and v.92 56Kbps model. Wireless networking 
comes standard with an 802.11a/b/g networking adapter. Those looking to use the 
upcoming high speed wireless standard can elect to upgrade this adapter to a 
draft 802.11b wireless card that also supports the 802.11a/b/g standards. 
<h3>Ports:</h3>  As far as the general expansion ports found on a notebook, 
the Alienware Area-51 m9750 has the traditional 4 USB 2.0 ports and single 
mini-FireWire port. It uses the newer ExpressCard/54 expansion slot over the 
more traditional PC Card slot. It has very good connections for those looking 
to use external speakers or audio. In addition to the traditional mini-jacks it 
also has a TOSlink optical port. If you want to hook up an external monitor, it 
features both a VGA and DVI-D connector. 
<h3>Software:</h3>  Alienware offers a variety of operating systems for their 
systems. Choices include either the new Vista Home Premium or Ultimate editions 
or the Windows XP Professional or Media Center editions. Beyond this, 
preinstalled software is kept to a minimum. Users have the option for some 
basic anti-virus and productivity software. Upgrade options include a variety 
of PC games that can be installed or upgraded productivity suites. 
<h3>Overall Impressions:</h3>  Alienware has a clear goal in mind with the 
production of the Area-51 m9750 and that is to make a top of the line gaming 
system. The fact that they are willing to configure the notebook with a SLI 
setup using two GeForce Go 7950 GTX graphics cores is a testament to that goal. 
In fact, a system that is built with the top of the line options is nearly an 
unbeatable mobile platform when it comes to PC gaming.
<p>What the Area-51 m9750 gives in terms of performance it gives up in terms 
of styling. Other companies that are geared towards PC gaming tend to offer 
customized designs that include a variety of colors and stenciled graphics on 
the case. While their desktop systems doe have some color combinations, the 
Area-51 m9750 comes in a single black color design. Of course, this limited 
design does have its advantages which is cost.</p> 
<p>The problem with most gaming specific notebooks is their extremely high 
price. Sure, the Area-51 m9750 can pack a very high price tag if it is fully 
configured with top of the line options. The big difference hear is that 
consumers can get a very strong graphics notebook at a very reasonable price if 
they are willing to go with more mainstream components. This is where the 
highly flexible component selection of the Alienware system shines.</p> 
<p>So, if you are in the market for a notebook computer for PC gaming notebook 
and have a tight budget or can afford pretty much anything, be sure to take a 
look at the Alienware Area-51 m9750.</p>
