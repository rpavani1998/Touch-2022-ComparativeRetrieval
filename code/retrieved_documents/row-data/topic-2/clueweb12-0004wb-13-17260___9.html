<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Jan 2 2012</em> - Apple's silent refresh of the Apple MacBook Pro 17 
added a few spec increases that help keep the system at high levels of 
performance. It gets a slightly faster quad core processor and AMD graphics 
processor. Everything else remains the same which means that it still has the 
thinnest profile and lightest weight of 17-inch laptops as well as some of the 
best battery life. It still has the same flaws as the version it replaces 
though including the lack of USB 3.0, a SD card slot and just 4GB of memory 
compared to most similarly priced laptops featuring twice as much. Still, it is 
hard to top Apple's design in terms of functionality or style.</p>

<h3>Review - Apple Fall 2011 MacBook Pro 17</h3> 
<p><em>Jan 2 2012</em> - Back in the fall of 2011, Apple silently refreshed 
theirSpring 2011 MacBook Pro 17. For the most part, the system remains 
unchanged. Externally, it looks identical to the version that was first 
introduced back in 2009. The solid aluminum chassis still stands out for its 
durability and overall design that has been imitated by many other companies.
</p> 
<p>The first change made to the MacBook Pro 17 was the processor. It was 
upgraded from the quad core Intel Core i7-2720QM to the Intel Core i7-2760QM. 
Essentially, this is a slightly bump in the overall speed of the processor but 
it has the same basic feature set. This should help benefit those that are 
using their system for intensive computing tasks such as desktop video editing. 
For those using the laptop for more mundane tasks, there won't be any real 
noticeable benefit. It would have been nice to see Apple increase the memory 
from the 4GB of DDR3 memory to something a bit more fitting a system priced at 
$2500. Most Windows based systems at half this price are offering double that 
amount.</p> 
<p>The other change is the graphics system. The past AMD Radeon HD 6750M has 
been upgraded to the AMD Radeon HD 6770M. For the most part, this won't have a 
huge impact for many users. The increased speed will benefit those that run 
tasks that actually will utilize the 3D acceleration features. Since most 
people don't get a MacBook Pro for gaming, it will be more beneficial to those 
using it toaccelerate video, BitCoin mining or accelerating applications like 
Photoshop. It still retains the feature where it will switch automatically 
between the integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 that is built into the Core i7 
processor and the AMD Radeon graphics when an application requires it.</p> 
<p>The final change is the release of the Mac OS X 10.7 or Lion operating 
system. Many of the changes to the operating system are cosmetic and can be 
enabled or disabled depending on if you want it to function more like past 
versions. Of these changes, the LaunchPad function that makes the desktop work 
more like an iOS based device like aniPad is the most interesting if not 
controversial change.</p> 
<p>The remaining features all are the same as past versions. This does include 
the new Thunderbolt port which is an electrical only variant of theLight Peak 
interface codeveloped with Intel. It functions as both a mini-DisplayPort port 
and a high speed interface for external devices such as storage. The FireWire 
800 port is a bit dated now but still can be used for external storage. It 
would have been nice to see an upgrade to theUSB 3.0 for at least one of the 
ports but this will most likely have to wait till the next major revision.</p> 
<p>Storage features remain unchanged as well. The hard drive is a large 750GB 
capacity but runs are the slightly mundane 5400rpm spin rate. It is possible to 
have a custom built model with asolid state drive installed but the cost is 
just way too much for an already quite expensive system. A dual layer DVD 
burner is there for those that still use physical media to load programs or 
watch movies. The biggest disappointment is the lack of a SDXC slot that is 
found in the smaller MacBook Pro models. Instead, anExpressCard slot is 
provided that has less relevance for consumers than it did several years ago.
</p> 
<p>Battery life for the MacBook Pro 17 is still incredible thanks to its large 
internal lithium polymer battery pack with its 95 WHr capacity rating. Apple 
still keeps the seven hour running time claim even with the slightly improved 
graphics and processor. In DVD playback tests, it still exceeds over five hours 
of playback time which is far longer than the majority of 17-inch laptops on 
the market. More traditional usage should be able to yield up to the full 
running time that Apple claims.</p> 
<p>One benefit that I haven't mentioned though is the pricing. The price 
remains unchanged which is nice for those that want the added performance. The 
better part though is that it has caused the price of the past Spring 2011 
version of the MacBook Pro 17 to drop several hundred dollars. This makes the 
entry to a 17-inch Apple laptop a bit more affordable for those that don't 
necessarily need the slight boosts made in this revision.</p> <br>

<strong>Don't 
undersell the ExpressCard/34 slot</strong>, Member BradMacPro 
<p>&quot;&quot;The biggest disappointment is the lack of a SDXC slot that is 
found in the smaller MacBook Pro models. Instead, an ExpressCard slot is 
provided that has less relevance for consumers than it did several years 
ago.&quot;&quot; That may be true of consumers, but this model is for 
professionals. The slot offers the ability to connect large and fast drives or 
arrays of drives via eSATA. A $20 adapter will do, but there exist faster 
options. Yes ThunderBolt should supplant eSATA, but the current choices are 
limited. There are also USB 3.0 adapters, but USB 3.0 being what it is, on the 
Mac, only the manufacturer's drives work with their cards. LaCie for example. 
There are also high performance multi-card or CompactFlash readers for digital 
photographers. SanDisk's Extreme Pro adapter reads the high capacity SDXC 
cards. Also external video adapters, and 4G WLAN adapters for the road warriors 
who don't want to go USB 2.0. I'd rather have choice via inexpensive adapters 
than be locked into SD/SDHC/SDXC</p> Write a review
