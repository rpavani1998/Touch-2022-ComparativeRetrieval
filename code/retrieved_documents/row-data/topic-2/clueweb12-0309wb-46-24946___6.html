<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 13 2010</em> - The MSI GX740-079US is a 
17-inch laptop that is designed for gamers on the go and it does this job quite 
well. Graphics and performance are both very strong and should handle gaming 
just fine. There are some quirks that may put off some buyers though including 
the keyboard layout and the battery pack placement. Still, for $1400, it does 
an excellent job of blancing gaming and more general purpose computing. Buy

<h3>Guide Review - MSI GX740-079US 17-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jul 13 2010</em> - MSI has built a lot of performance into their 
GX740-079US 17-inch desktop replacement laptop. Since the primary focus of the 
system is for mobile gamers, they need to put in a lot of performance. To do 
this, they have chosen to use the Intel Core i7-720QM quad core processor with 
its auto clocking features to allow the system to function well between single 
threaded games or multi-threaded desktop video applications. The 4GB of DDR3 
memory let it cruise through most applications without an issue.</p> 
<p>Storage features on the MSI GX740-079US are pretty common for a desktop 
replacement class system. It comes with a sizable 500GB hard drive that 
provides plenty of space for applications, data and media files. It spins at 
the faster 7200rpm desktop rate for improved data access rates. A standard dual 
layer DVD burner handles playback and recording of CD and DVD media.</p> 
<p>Rather than use a newer 16:9 aspect ratio display, MSI has stuck with the 
more traditional 16:10 aspect ratio 17-inch display. This gives the system a 
slightly higher 1680x1050 resolution compared to 1600x900 but it still falls 
short of a full 1080p high definition panel. Color is bright and response times 
are quick which is good for gaming and fast video. Gamers will be happy with 
the ATI Radeon Mobility HD 5870 graphics. This allows the system to fully 
handle games up to and past the panel's native resolution and even allows for 
the use of filters. It also is fully Direct X 11 capable for the highest level 
of details in modern games.</p> 
<p>With the emphasis on gaming, the keyboard design of the GX740 is a bit odd. 
Rather than keeping the left control key on the outside with the function key 
just to its right, MSI has flipped these two keys. This makes makes it more 
difficult for most games that use the typical WASD control layout. The right 
hand shift key is also a smaller size and placed next to the arrow keys that 
could cause issue for gamers and regular touch typists.</p> 
<p>MSI packs the GX740 with a very large nine-cell battery pack. It should be 
noted that this battery pack does extend out the back of the laptop behind the 
screen and can cause issue with some cable placements for the power cord. In 
terms of battery life, the system was able to achieve roughly one and three 
quarter hours before going into standby mode in my DVD playback test. This is 
about average for a gaming specific laptop. More typical usage should yield 
between two and two and a half hours.</p> 
<p>While the GX740 does an excellent job for gaming albeit with a few quirks 
with the keyboard, the system actually does a better job at being a more 
general purpose desktop replacement that also can be used for gaming. With a 
price around $1400, it also is quite affordable for such a high level of 
performance.</p> Buy Direct <br>
