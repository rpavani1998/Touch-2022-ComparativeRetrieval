<p></p> 
<p> Mobile computer devices (laptops, notebooks, PDAs, mobile cell phones, 
portable audio and video players, digital cameras, calculators, wearables, ...) 
are different from desktop/tower computers. They use certain hardware such as 
PCMCIA cards, infrared and BlueTooth ports, wireless LAN, LCD displays, 
batteries, docking stations. Hardware parts cannot be changed as easily as in a 
desktops, e.g. the graphics card. Often their hardware is more limited (e.g. 
disk space, CPU speed). Though the performance gap to desktops is becoming 
smaller, e.g. in many instances, laptops or notebooks can become a desktop 
replacement.</p> 
<p> Hardware support for Linux (and other operating systems) and mobile 
computer devices is sometimes more limited (e.g. graphics chips, internal 
modems). They often use specialized hardware, hence finding a driver can be 
more difficult. Many times they are used in changing environments, so there is 
a need for multiple configurations and additional security strategies.</p> 
<p> Though there are laptop, notebook, PDA and mobile phone related HOWTOs 
available already, this guide contains a concise survey of documents related to 
mobile computer devices. Also Linux features, such as installation methods for 
laptops, notebooks and PDAs as well as configurations for different (network) 
environments are described.</p> 
<p> Although there are some caveats, Linux is a better choice for mobile 
computer devices than most other operating systems, because it supports 
numerous installation methods, works in many heterogeneous environments and 
needs smaller resources.</p>

<h1>1. About the Author</h1> 
<p> People like either laptops or desktops. I like to work with laptops rather 
than with desktops. I like Linux too. My first HOWTO was theLinux-Infrared-HOWTO
 about infrared support for Linux. My second is this one and my third the
Linux-Ecology-HOWTO , about some ways to use Linux in an ecology aware manner. 
</p> 
<p> Also I have written some pages about Linux with all the laptops I had a 
chance to put Linux on. You may find them atTuxMobil Linux Laptop and Notebook 
Survey. </p> 
<p> During the work with the Linux-Mobile-Guide I have also collected some 
surveys about laptop related hardware:graphics chips , <em>unofficially</em> 
supportedPCMCIA cards , internal modems , infrared chips and other hardware. 
</p> 
<p> In May 2000 I have founded the German vendor Xtops.DE: Linux, Laptops, 
Notebooks, PDAs pre-installed, to sponsor the TuxMobil project. </p> 
<h1>2. Sponsoring</h1> 
<h2>2.1. How to and Why Sponsor?</h2> 
<p> This guide is free of charge (except the printed version, which contains 
an additional part) and free in the sense of the General Public Licence - GPL. 
Though it requires much work and could gain more quality if I would have some 
more hardware. So if you have a spare laptop, even an old one or one which 
requires repair, please let me know. For the curious, the first issues of this 
guide have been written on aHP OmniBook 800CT 5/100. </p> 
<p> Or sponsor a banner ad at TuxMobil: Linux with Laptops, Notebooks, PDAs, 
Mobile Phones and Portable Computers. </p> 
<p> You can hire me for readings or workshops on <em>Linux with Laptops</em>, 
<em>Linux with PDAs</em>, <em>Repairing of Laptops</em> and other Linux topics, 
too.</p>

<h1>3. About the Document</h1> Mirrors, Translations, Versions, Formats, URLs 
<h2>3.1. URLs in this Document</h2> 
<p> Many times I have mentioned <em>MetaLab</em> formerly known as <em>SunSite
</em>. This site carries a heavy load, so do yourself a favor, use one of the 
MetaLab mirrors . </p> 
<p> For <em>Debian/GNU Linux</em> the mirror URLs are organized in the scheme 
<b>http://www.&lt;country code, e.g. uk&gt;.debian.org</b> . </p> 
<p> Nearly all of the programs I mention are available as Debian/GNU Linux 
package, or as RPM package. Look up your favorite RPM server, for instance
rpmfind . </p>

<h1>4. Contact</h1> 
<p> This document isn't ready yet. If you like to write a chapter or even a 
smaller part by yourself, please feel free to contact me. Also your suggestions 
and recommendations and criticisms are welcome. But please don't expect me to 
solve your laptop related problems if the solution is already documented. 
Please read all appropriate manual pages, HOWTOs and WWW sites first, than you 
may consider to contact me or search in the chapterAppendix B Other Resources 
mentioned below.</p>

<h1>5. Disclaimer and Trademarks</h1> 
<p> This is free documentation. It is distributed in the hope that it will be 
useful, but without any warranty. The information in this document is correct 
to the best of my knowledge, but there's a always a chance I've made some 
mistakes, so don't follow everything too blindly, especially if it seems wrong. 
Nothing here should have a detrimental effect on your computer, but just in 
case, I take no responsibility for any damages incurred from the use of the 
information contained herein.</p> 
<p> Some laptop manufacturers don't like to see a broken laptop with an 
operating system other than the one shipped with it, and may reload MS-Windows 
if you complain of a hardware problem. They may even declare the warranty void. 
Though in my humble opinion this isn't legal or at least not fair. Always have 
a backup of both the original configuration and your Linux installation if you 
have to get your laptop repaired.</p> 
<p> Though I hope trademarks will be superfluous sometimes (you may see what I 
mean atOpen Source Definition ), I declare: If certain words are trademarks, 
the context should make it clear to whom they belong. For example &quot;MS 
Windows NT&quot; implies that &quot;Windows NT&quot; belongs to Microsoft (MS). 
&quot;Mac&quot; is a trademark by Apple Computer. Many of the designations used 
by manufacturers and sellers to distinguish their products are claimed as 
trademarks. Where those designations appear in this book, and I was aware of a 
trademark claim, the designations have been printed in caps or initial caps. 
All trademarks belong to their respective owners.</p>

<h1>Chapter 1. Which Laptop to Buy?</h1> 
<h1>1.1. Introduction</h1> 
<p> Portable computers may be divided into different categories. This is a 
subjective decision, but I try to do so. My groupings roughly follow the 
generally accepted marketing categories. The criteria could be:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Weight: Often expressed in terms like Portables, Laptops/Notebooks, 
Sub/Mini-Notebooks, Palmtops/PDAs. There is no standard method to define the 
weight of a laptop, therefore the data provided by the manufacturers (and which 
are given below) have to be considered as approximations. The question is how 
the power supply (whether external or internal) or swappable parts like CD and 
floppy drive, are included in the weight.</p>
<p> Most peripheral cables are appallingly heavy. If you get a subnotebook and 
carry it around with a bunch of external drives, cables, and<em>port expander
</em> dongles and power converter, you may be lugging a heavier bag than if it 
were all in one box. Subnotebooks are useful mainly if you can afford to leave 
all the other junk behind.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Supported Operating Systems: proprietary versus open </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Price: NoName versus Brand </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Hardware Features: display size, harddisk size, CPU speed, battery type, 
etc.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Linux Support: graphics chip, sound card, infrared controller (IrDA&reg;), 
internal modem, etc.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h1>1.2. Portables, Laptops/Notebooks, Sub/Mini-Notebooks, Palmtops, PDAs/HPCs
</h1> 
<h2>1.2.1. Portables</h2> 
<p> Weight greater than 4.0 kg (9 lbs). Features like a PC, but in a smaller 
box and withLCD display. Examples: lunchbox or ruggedized laptops (e.g. BSI 
Computer ). </p> 
<h2>1.2.2. Laptops/Notebooks</h2> 
<p> Weight between 1.7 and 4.0 kg (4 to 9 lbs). Features custom hardware and 
usually a special CPU. Examples: HP OmniBook 3100, COMPAQ Armada 1592DT. The 
terms<em>laptop</em> and <em>notebook</em> seem equivalent to me. </p> 
<h2>1.2.3. Sub-Notebooks/Mini-Notebooks</h2> 
<p> Weight between 1.3 and 1.7 kg (3 to 4 lbs). Features: external floppy 
drive, external CD drive. Examples: HP OmniBook 800CT, Toshiba Libretto 100, 
COMPAQ Aero, SONY VAIO 505.</p> 
<h2>1.2.4. Palmtops</h2> 
<p> Weight between 0.7 and 1.3 kg (1.5 to 3 lbs). Features: proprietary 
commercial operating systems. Examples: HP200LX.</p> 
<h2>1.2.5. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)/Handheld PCs (HPCs)</h2> 
<p> Weight below 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs). Features: proprietary commercial operating 
systems and often non-Intel CPU with commercial operating systems like PalmOS, 
EPOC32, GEOS, Windows CE. Examples: Newton Message Pad, Palm III (former 
Pilot), Psion Series 3 and 5, CASIO Z-7000.</p> 
<h2>1.2.6. Wearables</h2> 
<p> Watches, digital pens, calculators, digital cameras, cellular phones and 
other wearables.</p> 
<h1>1.3. Linux Features</h1> 
<p> Due to a lack of support by some manufacturers, not every feature of a 
laptop is always supported or fully operational. The main devices which may 
cause trouble are: graphics chip,IrDA&reg; port, sound card, PCMCIA controller 
, PnP devices and internal modem. Please try to get as much information about 
these topics before buying a laptop. But often it isn't quite easy to get the 
necessary information. Sometimes even the specifications or the hotline of the 
manufacturer aren't able to provide the information. Therefore I have included 
a Linux Compatibility Check chapter in every section ofPart V in <i>Linux on 
the Road</i> Hardware In Detail below. </p> 
<p> Depending on your needs, you might investigate one of the vendors that 
provide laptops pre-loaded with Linux. By purchasing a pre-loaded Linux laptop, 
much of the guesswork and time spent downloading additional packages could be 
avoided. See TuxMobil for asurvey of Linux laptop, notebook, PDA and mobile 
phone vendors. </p> 
<h1>1.4. Main Hardware Features</h1> 
<p> Besides its Linux features, there often are some <em>main features</em> 
which have to be considered when buying a laptop. For<em>Linux features</em> 
please seePart V in <i>Linux on the Road</i> Hardware In Detail below. </p> 
<h2>1.4.1. Weight</h2> 
<p> Don't underestimate the weight of a laptop. This weight is mainly 
influenced by:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> screen size </p></li> 
<li>
<p> battery type </p></li> 
<li>
<p> internal components, such as CD drive, floppy drive </p></li> 
<li>
<p> power supply </p></li> 
<li>
<p> material used for the case, usually they are either from plastics or from 
magnesium.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>1.4.2. Display</h2> 
<p> Recent laptops come with <em>active</em> matrix (TFT) displays. Laptops 
with<em>passive</em> matrix (DSTN) are no longer manufactured. Active matrix 
displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost more and use more 
power. Also consider the screen size. Laptops may be purchased with screens up 
to 17&quot;. A bigger screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry, 
but is good for a portable desktop replacement.</p> 
<h2>1.4.3. Batteries</h2> 
<p> The available battery types are <em>Lithium Ion (LiIon)</em>, <em>Nickel 
Metal Hydride ( NiMH)</em> and <em>Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)</em>. Though almost 
all current laptops come with LiIon batteries.</p> 
<p> LiIon batteries are the most expensive ones but a lot lighter than NiCd 
for the same energy content, and have minimal - but present - memory effects. 
NiMH is better than NiCd, but still rather heavy and does suffer some (although 
less than NiCd) memory effects.</p> 
<p> Unfortunately most laptops come with a proprietary battery size. So they 
are not interchangeable between different models.</p> 
<h2>1.4.4. CPU</h2> 
<h3>1.4.4.1. Supported CPU Families</h3> 
<p> For details about systems which are supported by the Linux Kernel, see the 
The linux-kernel mailing list FAQ. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> i286: Linux doesn't support this CPU family yet. But there are some 
efforts atELKS. If you like, you may use Minix, which is also a free Unix 
operating system. Minix supports 8088 to 286 CPUs with as little as 640K 
memory. Actually there are somelaptops with ELKS and MINIX around. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> i386: This covers PCs based on Intel-compatible processors, including 
Intel's 386, 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II, and compatible 
processors by AMD, Cyrix and others. Most of the currently available laptops 
use Intel compatible CPUs and have quite good Linux support.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> m68k: This covers Amigas and Ataris having a Motorola 680x0 processor for 
x&gt;=2; with MMU. And the early Apple/Macintosh computers.</p>
<p> There was a long series of Apple PowerBooks and other laptops based on the 
m68k chip. Macintosh Portable (an ugly 16-pound first attempt); PowerBook 100, 
140, 170, 145, 160, 180c, 165c, 520c, 540c, 550c, 190; Duo 210, 230, 250, 270c, 
280. The PowerBook Duos were available at the same time as the PowerBooks, they 
were a sort of subnotebook, but were designed so that you could plug them into 
a base station (a DuoDock) with more RAM, peripherals, etcetera, so that they 
could also act as a desktop computer. The first PowerPC PowerBooks were the 
ill-starred PowerBook 5300 (after the 190) and the Duo 2300c.</p>
<p> For a complete list of all Macintosh computers ever made, with 
specifications, seeApple-History . For Linux installation reports see Linux 
Laptop and Notebook Survey: Apple. </p>
<p> Note also that readers should *not* go to LinuxPPC for hardware 
compatibility with 68k laptops, as the name implies, LinuxPPC is only for 
PowerPC machines. The proper place to go for information on running Linux on 
m68k Macintoshes islinux-m68k. </p>
<p> &quot;Much like laptops of the Intel/Linux world, Mac laptops have 
generally different setups that can be very hard to figure out. Also, because 
of a general lack of machines to test, we are only aware of boots on the 
Powerbook 145, Powerbook 150, Powerbook 170, Powerbook 180, and Powerbook 190. 
Even if it boots, we currently have no support for Powerbook-style ADB, theAPM 
support, or just about anything else on them. This means the only way to log in 
is with a terminal hooked up to the serial interface, this has been tested on 
the 170.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Several Powerbooks have internal IDE which is supported. PCMCIA 
drivers will be forthcoming if someone can supply the necessary hardware 
information to write a driver. As always, an FPU is needed also. Many of the 
later models have the 68LC040 processor without FPU, and many of these 
processors are broken with respect to the FPU trap mechanism so they can't run 
regular Linux binaries even with FPU emulation. Current status on Powerbooks 
140, 160, 165, 165c, 180c, 190, 520 and Duos 210, 230, 250, 270c, 280, and 280c 
is unknown.&quot;</p>
<p> Also there are two Atari laptops, for which I don't have enough 
information. The following quotations are from theAtari Gallery. </p>
<p> &quot;The <em>STacy</em> was released shortly after the <em>Mega ST</em> 
to provide a portable means of Atari computing. STacy computers were shipped 
with TOS v1.04.</p>
<p> Designed to replace the <em>STacy</em> as the defacto portable ST 
computer, the<em>ST Book</em> brought the basic computing power of an ST to a 
lightweight notebook computer. This machine was only released in Europe and 
Atari only shipped a very small quantity. The ST Book was shipped with TOS 
v2.06.&quot;</p>
<p> From Stok, Leon &lt;stok_AT_YIS.NL&gt;: The STacey and the ST Book, both 
can't run Linux since they are only shipped with an 68000 CPU, which doesnt 
have a MMU unit.</p>
<p> As far as I know Amiga has never produced laptops. One company 
manufactured kits to convert desktop Amigas to portables. These used regular 
Amiga motherboards so any Linux setup that supports the regular Amiga setups 
will support these.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> PowerPC (PPC): Although some driver support present in Intel based Linux 
is still missing for Linux PPC, it is a fully usable system for Macintosh 
PowerBooks. SeeLinuxPPC for a current list of supported machines. </p>
<p> By the way: The team at iMac Linux has managed to get the iMac DV to boot 
Linux to a usable point. You may get information about the iBook there as well.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Alpha, Sparc, Sparc64 architectures: These are currently under 
construction. As far as I know there are only theTadpole SPARC and ALPHA 
laptops, and some other ALPHA laptops available.NatureTech offers also SPARC 
CPUs in laptops. The TuxMobil survey ofSolaris on laptops and notebooks may 
also be helpful.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> StrongARM: a very low-power CPU found in Rebel.com's popular NetWinder 
(some kind of mobile computer, too), and actively supported in the Debian 
project, it is also in several WinCE machines, such as HP's Jornadas. Only the 
lack of tech specs prevents Linux from being ported to these tiny, 
long-battery-life machines. A full-scale StrongARM-based laptop would make a 
superb Linux platform.</p>
<p> For PDAs with ARM/StrongARM CPU see the Part II in <i>Linux on the Road</i>
Handheld Devices part below.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> MIPS: Used in SGI mainframes and Cobalt Micro intranet appliances, chips 
based on this architecture are used in many Windows-CE machines. Linux has been 
ported to a few of these.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> AMD Processor: More about Linux on AMD processors may be found at x86-64 
org . At TuxMobil there is also a survey of laptops with AMD CPUs . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 64bit CPUs: At TuxMobil there is a survey of laptops with 64bit CPUs . </p>
</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>1.4.4.2. Miscellaneous</h3> 
<p> At higher speed, a CPU consumes more power and generates more heat. 
Therefore, in many laptops a special low-power CPU is used. Usually, this 
special CPU doesn't use as much power as a similar processor used in a desktop. 
These special CPUs are also more expensive. As a side effect you may find that 
laptops with a desktop CPU often have a quite noisy fan.</p> 
<h2>1.4.5. Number of Spindles</h2> 
<p> Laptops and notebooks are often described by the number of spindles. </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> one spindle: harddisk. Usually sub-notebooks, often provided with an 
external optical drive (CD/DVD).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> two spindles: harddisk, optical drive (CD/DVD). </p></li> 
<li>
<p> three spindles: harddisk, optical drive (CD/DVD), floppy drive. These 
laptops are often used as desktop PC replacement.</p></li> </ol> 
<h2>1.4.6. Cooling</h2> 
<p> An enormously important issue. Anything based on PPC or Pentium will 
generate enormous amounts of heat which must be dissipated. Generally, this 
means either a fan, or a heat sink the size of the case. If it's a fan, the air 
path shouldn't get blocked, or it will overheat and burn out. This means 
machines with a fan mounted in the bottom are a big, big mistake: you can't use 
them on a soft surface.</p> 
<h2>1.4.7. Keyboard Quality</h2> 
<p> Though you might use your desktop computer to do longer writings, a good 
keyboard can save you some head- and fingeraches. Look especially for the 
location of special keys like:<b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b>, <b>
&lt;Pos1&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;
</b> and the cursor keys. </p> 
<h2>1.4.8. Price</h2> 
<p> Laptops are quite expensive if you compare them with desktops (though 
maybe not if compared withLCD, IrDA&reg;, PCMCIA capabilities). So you may 
decide between a brand or no-name product. Though I would like to encourage you 
to take a<em>no-name</em> product, there are some caveats. I have experienced 
that laptops break often, so you are better off, when you have an after-sales 
warranty, which is usually only offered with brand products. Or you may decide 
to take a<em>second hand</em> machine. When I tried this, I discovered that the 
laptop market is changing quite often. A new generation is released 
approximately every three months (compared by CPU speed, harddisk capacity, 
screen size etc.). So laptops become old very quick. But this scheme often 
isn't followed by the prices for second hand laptops. They seem too expensive 
to me. Anyway if you plan on purchasing a second hand machine, review my 
recommendations on checking the machine.</p> 
<h2>1.4.9. Power Supply</h2> 
<p> If you travel abroad pay attention to the voltage levels which are 
supported by the power supply. Also the power supply is usually one of the 
heavier parts of a laptop. Another caveat is the power plug, which often is 
different from country to country.</p> 
<h1>1.5. Sources of More Information</h1> 
<p> Specifications, manuals and manufacturer support often are not helpful. 
Therefore you should retrieve information from other sources too:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> TuxMobil Linux Laptop and Notebook Survey , this survey covers other 
UniXes (for example BSD, Solaris), too.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Linux on Laptops. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> General information about manufacturer support you may find in my Linux 
Status Survey of Laptop and Notebook Manufacturers , though don't expect to 
much Linux support from them yet. Sometimes theMatrix of OEM/ODM Relations may 
help to find information for your laptop under another brand name.</p> 
<h1>1.6. Linux Compatibility Check</h1> 
<h2>1.6.1. Related Documentation</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p>

<p> PCI-HOWTO </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Plug-and-Play-HOWTO </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>1.6.2. Check Methods in General</h2> 
<p> If you can't find the necessary information through the above mentioned 
sources, you are on your own. Luckily, Linux provides many means to help. For 
details see the sectionPart V in <i>Linux on the Road</i> Hardware In Detail 
below. In general you may use:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> First of all the kernel itself. Look up what kind of hardware is detected 
by the kernel. You get this information during boot time or by<b>dmesg</b> or 
by looking into/var/log/messages. For the very first boot messages check 
/var/log/boot. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> If your kernel supports the /proc file system you may get detailed 
information about PCI devices by<b>cat /proc/pci</b> Please read the kernel 
documentationpci.txt. You may get further information about unknown PCI devices 
at theLinux PCI ID Repository, the home of the pci.ids file. From 2.1.82 
kernels on you may use the<b>lspci</b> command from the <b>pci-utils</b> 
package.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> To retrieve information about Plug-and-Play (PNP) devices use <b>
isapnp-tools</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Use <b>scsi_info</b> by David Hinds for SCSI devices or <b>scsiinfo</b>. 
</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> If you don't want to install a complete Linux you may retrieve this 
information by using a micro Linux ( seeAppendix A Appendix A). The package <b>
muLinux</b> provides even a small <b>systest</b> program and <b>TomsRtBt</b> 
comes with<b>memtest</b>. To use <b>memtest</b> you have to copy it on a floppy 
<b>dd if=/usr/lib/memtest of=/dev/fd0</b> and to reboot from this floppy. </p> 
<p> If your laptop came with Windows, you may determine a lot of hardware 
settings from the installation. Boot into DOS or Windows to get the information 
you need.</p> 
<p> Using Windows9x/NT to get hardware settings, basically boot Windows, then 
<b>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Device Manager
</b> and write down everything, or make a hardcopy from the display using the 
<b>&lt;PRINT&gt;</b> key, plus keep a log of settings, hardware, memory, etc. 
</p> 
<p> Using MS-DOS and Windows3.1x you can use the command <b>msd</b>, which is 
an akronym for MicroSoft Diagnostics. Or you might try one of the numerous DOS 
shareware utilities:<b>CHECK-IT</b>, <b>DR.HARD</b> and others. </p> 
<p> Sometimes it's difficult to know what manufacturer has built the machine 
or parts of it actually. TheFCC &quot;Federal Communications Commission On-line 
Equipment Authorization Database may be used, if you are having problems 
identifying the manufacturer of a laptop or notebook computer (or other 
electronic device,) this site lets you search the FCC database based on the FCC 
ID number you can usually find on the equipment if it was marketed in the 
United States of America.&quot;</p> 
<p> Many laptops are no more compatible with Windows than Linux. David Hinds, 
author of thePCMCIA drivers, points out that Toshiba notebooks use a 
proprietary ToshibaPCMCIA bridge chip that exhibits the same bugs under Windows 
as under Linux.IBM&trade; Thinkpads have serious BIOS problems that affect 
delivery of events to the power management daemon<b>apmd</b>. These bugs also 
affect MS-Windows, and are listed inIBM&trade;'s documentation as <em>
considerations</em>. </p> 
<p> Some incompatibilities are temporary, for instance laptops that have 
Intel'sUSB chip will probably get full USB support, eventually. </p> 
<h1>1.7. Writing a Device Driver</h1> 
<p> If you encounter a device which is not yet supported by Linux, don't 
forget it's also possible to write a driver by yourself. You may look at the 
book from Alessandro Rubini, Andy Oram: Linux Device Drivers. There is even a 
free online issuehere . </p> 
<h1>1.8. Buying a Second Hand Laptop</h1> 
<p> Some recommendations to check a used laptop, before buying it: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Review the surface of the case for visible damages. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the display for pixel faults. Maybe it's useful to take a magnifying 
glass therefore. By the way: There is a standard for pixel faults etc. ISO 
13406-2.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Do an IO stress-test, .e.g. with the tool <b>bonnie</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> You may use <b>memtest</b> and <b>crashme</b> to achieve a memory test. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Do a CPU stress test, e.g. with the command <b>md5sum /dev/urandom</b> or 
by compiling a kernel.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the floppy drive by formatting a floppy. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the CD/DVD drive by reading and writing a CD/DVD. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> To check the battery seems difficult, because it needs some time: one 
charge and one work cycle. You may use<b>battery-stats</b> to do so, but note 
this tool only offer APM support, it is not available with ACPI support yet.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> To check the surface of the harddisk you may take <b>e2fsck</b>. There is 
also a Linux tool<b>dosfsck</b> or the other <b>fsck</b> tools. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> To test the entire disk (non-destructively), time it for performance, and 
determine its size, as root do:<b>time dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=1024k</b> 
.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check whether the machine seems to be stolen. I have provided a survey of 
databases for stolen laptops. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> AFAIK there is no Linux tool like the DOS tools CHECK-IT, DR. HARD, 
SYSDIAG and others. These tools include many of the tests in one integrated 
suite. One of the best in my humble opinion is the toolPC Diagnostics 95 made 
by Craig Hart. Despite the 95 in its name it's plain DOS, tiny ( 76KB program 
and 199KB data) reliable and free. Unfortunately it contains no check for the
IrDA&reg; port. </p>

<p> Laptop computers, unlike desktop machines, really do get used up. <em>
Lithium batteries</em> are good for no more than 400 recharge cycles, sometimes 
much fewer.<em>Keyboards</em> wear out. <em>LCD screen backlighting</em> grows 
dim.<em>Mouse buttons</em> fail. Worst of all, <em>connectors</em> get loose as 
a result of vibration, causing intermittent failures (e.g. only when you hit 
the &lt;Enter&gt; key). We have heard of a machine used on the table in a train 
being shaken to unusability in one trip.</p> 
<h1>1.9. No Hardware Recommendations</h1> 
<p> It's difficult to give any recommendations for a certain laptop model in 
general. Your personal needs have to be taken into account. Also the market is 
changing very quickly. I guess every three months a new generation of laptops 
(with bigger harddisk space, higher CPU speed, more display size, etc.) comes 
into the market. So I don't give any model or brand specific recommendations. 
But you may check myLinux support of laptop and notebook manufacturers survey. 
</p> 
<p> A good way to check Linux hardware compatibility the next time you go 
shopping a laptop is using aKnoppix CD/DVD. The Knoppix hardware detection 
works quite well and is often capable to check all laptop hardware.</p> 
<h1>1.10. Linux Laptop and PDA Vendor Survey</h1> 
<p> You may check the Linux Laptop, PDA and Mobile Phone Vendor Survey at 
TuxMobil for a reseller in your country. Some of them even sell laptops without 
Microsoft operating systems.</p> 
<p> Often it is difficult to get laptops without a pre-installed Microsoft 
operating system. In case you do not want to use it you may readsome tips and 
tricks to get rid of the Microsoft tax. If you want to buy a recent machine 
check theLinux installation reports for recently available laptops and notebooks
.</p> 
<h1>Chapter 2. Laptop Distributions</h1> 
<h1>2.1. Requirements</h1> 
<p> From the Battery-Powered-HOWTO I got this recommendation (modified by WH): 
</p> 
<p> A Message to Linux Distributors: If you happen to be a Linux distributor, 
thank you for reading all this. Laptops are becoming more and more popular, but 
still most Linux distributions are not very well prepared for portable 
computing. Please make this section of this document obsolete, and make a few 
changes in your distribution.</p> 
<p> The installation routine should include a configuration, optimized for 
laptops. The<em>minimal install</em> is often not lean enough. There are a lot 
of things that a laptop user does not need on the road. Just a few examples. 
There is no need for three different versions of<b>vi</b>. Some portable 
systems do not need printing support.</p> 
<p> Don't forget to describe <em>laptop-specific installation problems</em>, 
e. g. how to install your distribution without a CD/DVD-ROM drive.</p> 
<p> Add better <em>power management</em> and seamless <em>PCMCIA support</em> 
to your distribution. Add a recompiled kernel and an alternative set ofPCMCIA 
drivers with<em>apm support</em> that the user can install on demand. Include a 
precompiled<em>apmd package</em> with your distribution. Also include IrDA&reg; 
infrared support andUSB support. </p> 
<p> Add support for dynamically <em>switching network configurations</em>. 
Most Linux laptops travel between locations with different network settings (e. 
g. the network at home, the network at the office and the network at the 
university) and have to change the network ID very often.</p> 
<p> Add a <em>convenient PPP dialer</em> with an address book, that does not 
try to start multiple copies of the PPP daemon if you click on the button twice 
(e.g., the RedHat<b>usernet</b> tool). It would be nice to have the PPP dialer 
also display the connection speed and some statistics. One nice command line 
dialer that autodetects modems and PPP services is<b>wvdial</b> from 
OpenSourceInNitix. </p> 
<p> At TuxMobil you may find a huge number of links to laptop and notebook 
Linux installation reports. They are ordered by manufacturer and Linux 
distribution. Special categories are available for:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Debian, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Gentoo, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> RedHat, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> SuSE, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Ubuntu, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> SlackWare, </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Mandrake (Mandriva), </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Minix and </p></li> 
<li>
<p> different kinds of BSD flavors. </p></li> </ul> Some resources are 
available indifferent languages, e.g. 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> in German TuxMobil(DE): Linux on Mobile Computers </p></li> 
<li>
<p> in Russian TuxMobil(RU): Linux on Mobile Computers </p></li> 
<li>
<p> and in Chinese TuxMobil(CN): Linux on Mobile Computers. </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h1>2.2. Recommendation</h1> 
<p> The Debian/GNU Linux has most of the desired features for a laptop 
installation. The distribution has a quite flexible installation tool. The 
installation process is well documented, especially concerning the methods 
which are useful for laptops. All the binaries are tiny, because they are 
stripped. A mailing list<em>debian-laptop</em> including a searchable archive 
is provided. And Debian/GNU Linux is free.</p> 
<p> At the end of August 1999 the Debian Laptop Distribution - Proposal was 
issued. And some more laptop related packages and a Debian<em>meta-package</em> 
dedicated to laptops are on the way.</p> 
<p> Note: I know other Linux distributions work well with laptops, too. I even 
tried some of them, see my pages about certain laptops mentioned above.</p>

<h1>3.2. Prerequisites - BIOS, Boot Options, Partitioning</h1> 
<h2>3.2.1. BIOS</h2> 
<p> When starting a fresh installation you should try with standard BIOS 
options. If something doesn't work you should try to modify BIOS options. For 
example a well known trouble maker is the Plug-and-Play - PnP option (which 
comes with different names). See also the BIOS section in the hardware section 
below.</p> 
<h2>3.2.2. Boot Options</h2> 
<p> There are many boot options, which have effects on the behavior of 
laptops, e.g.<b>apm=on|off</b> and <b>acpi=on|off</b>: For details see 
BootPrompt-HOWTO and the Kernel documentation in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt . </p> 
<h2>3.2.3. Partitioning</h2> 
<p> Partitioning can be done in a very sophisticated way. Currently I have 
only some first thoughts. I assume that with laptops there are still some 
reasons (e.g. updating the firmware ofPCMCIA cards and BIOS) to share Linux and 
Windows9x/NT. Depending on your needs and the features of your laptop you could 
create the following partitions:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> BIOS, some current BIOSes use a separate partition, for instance COMPAQ 
notebooks</p></li> 
<li>
<p> suspend to disk, some laptops support this feature </p></li> 
<li>
<p> swap space Linux </p></li> 
<li>
<p> swap space Windows9x/NT </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Linux base </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Linux /home for personal data (please consider an encrypted partition for 
security reasons, for details about encryption see the according chapter below)
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> common data between Linux and Windows9x/NT </p></li> 
<li>
<p> small (~32MB) boot partition for yaBoot (Linux/PPC boot loader), in HFS 
<em>MacOS Standard</em> format. </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Note this chapter isn't exhausting yet. Please read the appropriate HOWTOs 
first, e.g. thePartition-HOWTO . </p> 
<h1>3.3. Linux Tools to Repartition a Hard Disk</h1> 
<h2>3.3.1. GNU parted</h2> 
<p> GNU parted allows you to create, destroy, resize and copy partitions. It 
currently supports ext2 and fat (fat16 and fat32) filesystems, Linux swap 
partitions, and MS-DOS disklabels, as well as Macintosh and PC98. For NTFS file 
systems seentfsresize . </p> 
<h2>3.3.2. ext2resize</h2> 
<p> ext2resize is a program capable of resizing (shrinking and growing) ext2 
and ext3 filesystems. Checks whether the new size the user gave is feasible 
(i.e. whether the filesystem isn't too occupied to shrink it), connected to the
<b>parted</b> project. </p> 
<h2>3.3.3. fixdisktable</h2> 
<p> Something was recently published on the 
&lt;linux-kernel_at_vger.rutgers.edu&gt; mailing list about a partition 
recovery program. I have neither used , nor examined, nor read much about it 
(except for the HTML page.) It may be useful to some of you if you have 
problems withFIPS , Ranish Partition Manager/Utility or Partition Magic 
destroying your partition information. You can find information on this 
partition-fixer named &quot;fixdisktable&quot; athis pages. It is quite a ways 
down in that page. Or look for itvia ftp and locate the latest 
&quot;fixdisktable&quot; in that FTP directory. (Source and binary dist should 
be available.)</p> 
<h2>3.3.4. Caveats</h2> 
<p> Before repartitioning your hard disk take care about the disk layout. 
Especially look for hidden disk space or certain partitions used for<em>suspend 
to disk</em> or <em>hibernation</em> mode. Some laptops come with a partition 
which contains someBIOS programs (e.g. COMPAQ Armada 1592DT). Search the manual 
carefully for tools like<b>PHDISK.EXE</b>, Suspend to Disk, Diagnostic TOOLS. 
</p> 
<p> Patrick D. Ashmore has recently released a Linux utility to prepare 
hibernation partitions for use with laptops and notebooks using Phoenix 
NoteBIOS. &quot;This utility isn't needed to utilize theAPM 
&quot;Suspend-To-Disk&quot; feature ... if you already have a valid hibernation 
partition, you should be able to use it from any operating system that can 
handleAPM suspends. </p> 
<p> However, if one ever upgrades hard drive, memory, or repartitions their 
hard drive, they discover that they either have to do without the 
suspend-to-disk feature or boot to DOS and use the<b>PHDISK.EXE</b> program 
provided with their laptop or directly from Phoenix Technologies.</p> 
<p> Now, Linux users are free from this restriction. <b>lphdisk</b> is a Linux 
utility that properly prepares these partitions for use. Not only does this 
eliminate having to boot to DOS, but my utility does not exhibit some of the 
nastier bugs that its DOS counterpart has.&quot;</p> 
<p> Please see chapter DOS Tools to Repartition a Hard Disk, too. </p> 
<h2>3.3.5. Multi Boot</h2> 
<p> Please see the chapter chapter Chapter 15 Different Environments, for 
information about booting different operating systems from the same harddisk.

<h1>3.4. Laptop Installation Methods</h1> &nbsp; <i>
<p><i>There's More Than One Way To Do It - TMTOWTDI</i></p></i> <br>
&nbsp; <i>
 Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen &amp; Randal L. Schwartz: Programming Perl, Sec. 
Ed. 1996 p. 10</i> <br>
<br>

<p> From the Battery-Powered-HOWTO : &quot;Installing and using Linux on a 
laptop is usually no problem at all, so go ahead and give it a try. Unlike some 
other operating systems, Linux still supports and runs well on even very old 
hardware, so you might give your outdated portable a new purpose in life by 
installing Linux on it.&quot;</p> 
<p> One of the great benefits of Linux are its numerous and flexible 
installation features, which I don't want to describe in detail. Instead I try 
to focus on<em>laptop specific methods</em>, which are necessary only in 
certain circumstances.</p> 
<p> Most current distributions support installation methods which are useful 
for laptops, including installation from CD-ROM, viaPCMCIA and NFS (or maybe 
SMB). Please see the documents which are provided with these distributions for 
further details or take a look at the above mentioned manuals and HOWTOs.</p> 
<h2>3.4.1. From a Boot Floppy plus CD/DVD-ROM - The Traditional Way</h2> 
<p> With modern laptops, the traditional Linux installation method (from one 
boot floppy, one support floppy and a package of CD-ROMs or one DVD) should be 
no problem, if there is a floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive available. Though 
with certain laptops you might get trouble, if you can not use<em>the floppy 
drive and the CD/DVD-ROM drive</em> simultaneously, or if the floppy drive is 
<em>only available as a PCMCIA device</em>, as with the Toshiba Libretto 100. 
Some laptops support also booting and therefore installation completely from a 
CD drive, as reported for the SONY VAIO in theVAIO+Linux-HOWTO . Note: Check the
BIOS for the CD boot option and make sure your Linux distribution comes on a 
bootable CD.</p> 
<p> Certain laptops will only boot <em>zImage</em> kernels. <em>bzImage</em> 
kernels won't work. This is a known problem with theIBM&trade; Thinkpad 600 and 
Toshiba Tecra series, for instance. Some distributions provide certain boot 
floppies for these machines or for machines with limited memory resources,
Debian/GNU Linux for instance. </p> 
<h2>3.4.2. From a CD/DVD-ROM - The Usual Way</h2> 
<p> Newer laptops are able to boot a Linux distribution from a bootable 
CD/DVD-ROM. This allows installation without a floppy disk drive. If the CD/DVD 
drive is<em>only available as a PCMCIA device</em>, as with the SONY VAIO 
PCG-Z600TEK, see the chapter about installing from PCMCIA devices below.</p> 
<h2>3.4.3. From a DOS or Windows Partition on the same Machine</h2> 
<p> This is a short description of how to install from a CD-ROM under DOS 
without using boot or supplemental floppy diskettes. This is especially useful 
for notebooks with<em>swappable floppy and CD-ROM components</em> (if both are 
mutually exclusive) or if they are<em>only available as PCMCIA devices</em>. I 
have taken this method fromInstalling Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 For Intel x86 - 
Chapter 5 Methods for Installing Debian : </p>

<p> Get the following files from your nearest Debian FTP mirror and put them 
into a directory on your DOS partition:<b>resc1440.bin drv1440.bin base2_1.tgz 
root.bin linux install.bat</b> and <b>loadlin.exe</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Boot into DOS (not Windows) without any drivers being loaded. To do this, 
you have to press &lt;<b>F8</b>&gt; at exactly the right moment during boot. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Execute <b>install.bat</b> from the directory where you have put the 
downloaded files.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Reboot the system and install the rest of the distribution, you may now 
use all the advanced features such asPCMCIA, PPP and others. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> This should work for other distributions as well. Maybe you have to do 
some appropriate changes.</p> 
<h2>3.4.4. From a Second Machine With a Micro Linux On a Floppy</h2> 
<h3>3.4.4.1. Introduction</h3> 
<p> Because of their small or nonexistent footprint, micro-Linuxes are 
especially suited to run on laptops, particularly if you use a company-provided 
laptop running Windows9x/NT. Or for installation purposes using another non 
Linux machine. There are several<em>micro</em> Linux distributions out there 
that boot from one or two floppies and run off a ramdisk. SeeAppendix A 
Appendix A for a listing of distributions.</p> 
<p> I tried the following with <b>muLinux</b> ( available at muLinux ) to 
clone my HP OmniBook 800 to a COMPAQ Armada 1592DT. Thanks to Michele Andreoli, 
maintainer of muLinux for his support. Since<b>muLinux</b> doesn't support 
PCMCIA yet, you may use <b>TomsRtBt</b> instead. In turn <b>TomsRtBt</b> 
doesn't support<b>PPP</b> but provides <b>slip</b>. Note: Since version 7.0 <b>
muLinux</b> provides an Add-On with PCMCIA support. </p> 
<p> I have described how to copy an already existing partition, but it might 
also be possible to achieve a customized installation. Note: Usually you would 
try to achieve an installation via NFS, which is supported by many 
distributions. Or if your sources are not at a Linux machine you might try the 
SMB protocol with SAMBA, which is also supported by<b>muLinux</b> . </p> 
<h3>3.4.4.2. Prerequisites</h3> 
<p> You need two machines equipped with Linux. With the laptop 
(client/destination) on which you want to install Linux use the muLinux floppy. 
The other machine (server/source) may be a usual Linux box or also using 
muLinux. Though its low transfer rate I use a serial null modem cable because 
its cheap. You may apply the appropriate method using aPCMCIA network card and 
a crossover network cable or a HUB, or a parallel &quot;null modem&quot; cable 
and PLIP. As the basic protocol I used PPP, but you may also use SLIP. For the 
data-transfer I used<b>nc</b>. Note: this is an abbrevation for <b>netcat</b>, 
some distributions use this as the program name. You may use<b>ftp</b>, <b>tftp
</b>, <b>rsh</b>, <b>ssh</b>, <b>dd</b>, <b>rcp</b>, <b>kermit</b>, <b>NFS</b>, 
<b>SMB</b> and other programs instead. </p> 
<p> Basic requirements are: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> A good knowledge about using Linux. You have to know exactly what you are 
doing, if not you might end destroying former installations.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> A null modem serial cable. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>3.4.4.3. Source Machine</h3> 
<p> At your <em>source</em> machine issue the following commands (attention: 
IP address, port number, partition and tty are just examples!):</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Edit /etc/ppp/options, it should contain only: </p> 
<pre> /dev/ttyS0 115200 passive </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p></li> 
<li>
<p> With muLinux versions 3.x you may even use the convenient command <b>setup 
-f ppp</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Start PPP: <b>pppd</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Configure the PPP network device: <b>ifconfig ppp0 192.168.0.1</b> . </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Add the default route: <b>route add default gw 192.168.0.1</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the network connection: <b>ping 192.168.0.2</b>, though the 
destination machine isn't up yet.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Start the transfer from another console, remember <b>
&lt;LEFT-ALT&gt;&lt;Fx&gt;</b>: <b>cat /dev/hda2 | gzip -c | nc -l -p 5555</b> .
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> After the transfer (there are no more harddisk writings) stop the ping: <b>
killall ping</b> . </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>3.4.4.4. Destination Machine</h3> 
<p> At the <em>destination</em> machine issue: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Edit /etc/ppp/options, it should contain only: </p> 
<pre> /dev/ttyS0 115200 passive </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p></li> 
<li>
<p> With muLinux versions &gt;= 3.x you may even use the convenient command <b>
setup -f ppp</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Start PPP: <b>pppd</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Configure the PPP network device: <b>ifconfig ppp0 192.168.0.2</b> . </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Add the default route: <b>route add default gw 192.168.0.2</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the network connection, by pinging to the source machine: <b>ping 
192.168.0.1</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Change to another console and get the data from the server: <b>nc 
192.168.0.1 5555 | gzip -dc &gt;/dev/hda4</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 400 MB may take app. 6 hours, but your mileage may vary. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Stop the transfer, when it is finished with: <b>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;C&gt;</b> . 
This can probably be avoided (but I didn't test it) by adding a timeout of 3 
seconds using the<b>-w 3</b> parameter for <b>nc</b> at the destination machine 
<b>nc -w 3 192.168.0.1 5555 | gzip -dc &gt;/dev/hda4</b> </p></li> 
<li>
<p> After the transfer is completed, stop the ping: <b>killall ping</b> . </p>
</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>3.4.4.5. Configuration of the Destination Machine after the Transfer</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Edit /etc/fstab . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Edit /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/lilo.msg and start <b>lilo</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Set the new root device to the kernel: <b>rdev image root_device</b> . </p>
</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>3.4.4.6. Miscellaneous</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> You may use <b>bzip2</b> the same way as <b>gzip</b> (untested). </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Since <b>rshd</b>, <b>sshd</b>, <b>ftpd</b> daemons are not available with 
muLinux, you have to build your own file transfer mechanism with<b>nc</b> also 
known as<b>netcat</b>, as described above. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> I had to set up both PPP sides very quickly or the connection broke, I 
don't know why.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Speed optimization has to be done. Maybe these PPP options will help: <b>
asyncmap 0</b> or <b>local</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> I checked this only with a destination partition greater than the source 
partition. Please check<b>dd</b> instead of <b>cat</b> therefore. </p>
<p> Or do the following (untested): At the destination machine <b>cd</b> into 
the root directory/ and do <b>nc -l -p 5555 | bzip2 -dc | tar xvf -</b>. At the 
source machine<b>cd</b> into the root directory / and do <b>tar cvf - . | bzip2 
| nc -w 3 192.168.0.2 5555</b>. This should shorten the time needed for the 
operation, too. Because only the allocated blocks need to be transfered.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Don't <b>mount</b> the destination partition. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>3.4.5. From a Second Machine With a 2.5&quot; Hard Disk Adapter</h2> 
<p> From Adam Sulmicki adam_AT_cfar.unc.edu I got this hint: Most but not all 
harddisks in laptops are removable, but this might be not an easy task. You 
could just buy one of those cheap 2.5&quot; IDE converters/adapters which allow 
you to connect this harddisk temporarily to a PC with IDE subsystem, and 
install Linux as usual using that PC. You may do so using the harddisk as the 
first IDE drive or besides as the second IDE drive. But then you need to be 
sure that<b>lilo</b> writes to the right partition. Also you have to make sure 
that you use the same translation style as your laptop is going to use (i.e. 
LBA vs. LARGE vs. CHS ). You will find additional information in the
Hard-Disk-Upgrade-HOWTO. You might copy an existing partition, but it is also 
possible to achieve a customized installation.</p> 
<h2>3.4.6. From a PCMCIA Device</h2> 
<p> Since I don't have a laptop which comes with a PCMCIA <em>floppy drive</em>
 (for instance Toshiba Libretto 100), I couldn't check this method. Please see 
the chapter Booting from aPCMCIA Device in the PCMCIA-HOWTO. Also I couldn't 
check whether booting from aPCMCIA <em>harddisk</em> is possible. </p> 
<p> Anyway, when you are able to boot from a floppy and the laptop provides a 
PCMCIA slot, it should be possible to use different PCMCIA cards to connect to 
another machine, to an external SCSI device, different external CD and ZIP 
drives and others. Usually these methods are described in the documentation 
which is provided with the distribution.</p> 
<p> The Sony Vaio (PCG-Z600) comes with an external USB-Floppy and an external 
CD-ROM (PCMCIA). You can boot from the CD-ROM, but afterwards Linux doesn't 
recognize the same drive anymore so that you can't install from it. You'll have 
to add the bootparameter<b>linux ide2=0x180,0x360</b> (or 0x180,0x386?) at the 
LILO boot prompt if you want Linux to recognize a PCMCIA CDROM after the kernel 
has booted.</p> 
<h2>3.4.7. From a Parallel Port ZIP Drive</h2> 
<p> I couldn't check this method by myself, because I don't have such a 
device. Please check the appropriateInstall-From-Zip-HOWTO . Also I don't know 
how much these installation methods are supported by the Linux distributions or 
the micro Linuxes. I suppose you have to fiddle around a bit to get this 
working.</p> 
<p> From Jeremy Impson &lt;jdimpson_AT_acm.org&gt;: I installed Red Hat 6.1 on 
a Libretto 50CT. It only has a PCMCIA floppy drive. (Which BTW isn't well 
supported by the default PCMCIA floppy driver. I needed to download a patch 
from some Linux on Libretto web site.)</p> 
<p> Linux will boot off the PCMCIA floppy drive, however. It just can't go 
back to the floppy after loading the kernel. My Libretto (the 50CT) only has 
one PCMCIA slot (later models had two slots, or I could have gotten the 
enhanced port replicator, which gave it another slot). So I couldn't boot off a 
floppy and then mount a remote filesystem.</p> 
<p> So I downloaded ZipSlack (Slackware designed for running from a ZIP disk) 
and used another PC to load it onto a ZIP disk. I attached the ZIP drive to the 
Libretto (via the parallel port on the regular port replicator that comes with 
it) and booted from the Slackware boot disk in the PCMCIA floppy drive. When 
booted, I removed the floppy drive and inserted and configured a network PCMCIA 
card. At this point the kernel is in memory and it is using the filesystem on 
the ZIP disk.</p> 
<p> I partitioned and formatted the Libretto's harddrive and then ftp'd Red 
Hat 6.1 installation source onto one of the new partitions (the partition that 
would become/home when everything gets done). This is the key: if you don't 
have enough disk space to have the installation files plus enough to actually 
install the OS on to, this method won't work.</p> 
<p> I shut down the ZipSlack kernel and rebooted it using a RedHat install 
disk in the floppy drive. I pointed it at the RH6.1 installation media already 
on the harddrive and started the install.</p> 
<h2>3.4.8. From a Parallel Port CD Drive (MicroSolutions BackPack)</h2> 
<p> I had tried myself to install Linux using the MicroSolutions BackPack 
parallel CD-ROM drive. It is fully supported by Linux and I haven't had any 
major problem running it. Until version 2.0.36 it is supported by its own 
module (<b>bpck</b>) while in later versions it has been merged in the more 
general parallel port ide adaptors (the<b>paride</b> module that relays then of 
course on more specific low level drivers, which in the BackPack case is still 
called<b>bpck</b>). </p> 
<p> In RedHat 5.x based installations the <b>bpck</b> module is available 
already at installation stage so you'll just have to select the BackPack cdrom 
from the<em>Other CD-ROMs</em> at the installation stage and then give it some 
more options (but<b>autoprobe</b> should work just fine). </p> 
<p> In RedHat 6.x (which uses 2.2.x kernels and should then use <b>paride</b>
), the BackPack support was dropped. So to install the distribution from such a 
device, you will have to customize the bootdisk (adding the necessary modules) 
and the installation will be done without any problem.</p> 
<p> Federico Pellegrin has customized a RedHat bootdisk that includes all the 
parallel CDROM devices that are supported by the distribution Linux kernel 
version (2.2.12) that should then work on all the supported parallel CDROM 
devices (even if he only tested it on his MicroSolutions BackPack since he 
doesn't have other similar hardware). You can findsome information on it and 
the bootdisk image. </p> 
<p> As from RedHat 6.2 a supplementary driver disk was included in the 
distribution to support the paride devices. You'll just have to create the 
driver disk (the image file is<b>paride.img</b> and can be found in the 
images/drivers directory) in the usual way and insert it when the installer 
will ask for it.</p> 
<p> Of course I suppose there isn't any problem in installing any other Linux 
distribution using such a device as long as you can add and configure the 
appropriate modules at the very beginning of the installation stage, but I 
haven't tested any.</p> 
<p> You should take care of the mode the parallel port uses (ECP, EPP, Output 
only, PS/2) since some of them may cause your laptop to suddenly freeze or 
cause serious data corruption. On the other side some modes make the 
communication dramatically slow (I found the best choice on my laptop the PS/2, 
but you should make some tests).</p>

CDROM-HOWTO. </p> 
<h2>3.4.9. From a Parallel Port Using a Second Machine</h2> PLIP Network 
Install 
<p> I got this courtesy by Nathan Myers &lt;ncm_AT_cantrip.org&gt;: &quot;Many 
distributions support installing via a network, using FTP, HTTP, or NFS. It is 
increasingly common for laptops to have only a singlePCMCIA slot, already 
occupied by the boot floppy drive. Usually the boot floppy image has drivers 
for neither the floppy drive itself, nor thePCMCIA subsystem. Thus, the only 
network interface available may be the parallel port.</p> 
<p> Installation via the parallel port using the PLIP protocol has been 
demonstrated on, at least, Red Hat. All you need is a<em>Laplink</em> parallel 
cable, cheap at any computer store. See thePLIP-HOWTO for details on setting up 
the connection. Note that (uniquely) the RedHat installation requires that the 
other end of the PLIP connection be configured to use ARP (apparently because 
RedHat uses the DOS driver in their installer). On the host, either<b>export</b>
 your CD file system on NFS, or<b>mount</b> it where the ftp or web daemon can 
find it, as needed for the installation.&quot;</p> 
<p> The PLIP Install HOWTO by Gilles Lamiral describes how to install a Linux 
distribution on a computer without ethernet card, nor CD drive, but just a 
local floppy drive and a remote NFS server attached by a nullmodem parallel 
cable.</p> 
<h2>3.4.10. From a USB Storage Device (Stick, CD, DVD, Floppy)</h2> 
<p> If booting from an USB device is supported from the BIOS, it is possible 
to install Linux from this drive. Besides some old laptops, almost all laptops 
equipped with USB ports support this feature.</p> 
<p> First you have to configure the BIOS to boot from an USB device. Sometimes 
it is possible to use a certain key combination (e.g. &lt;ESC&gt;) during the 
boot process to select the boot device.</p> 
<p> Second you have to install Linux on the boot medium (let's say an 
USB-Stick) and make it bootable. There are some special Linux distributions 
available, which are dedicated for such purposes, e.g.:</p> 
<p> Feather Linux is a Linux distribution which runs completely off a CD or a 
USB pendrive and takes up under 64Mb of space. It is a Knoppix remastered 
(based on Debian/GNU Linux), and tries to include software which most people 
would use every day on their desktop. See theseinstructions about installing 
Feather Linux on an USB drive. </p> 
<p> Partboot is dedictated to USB floppy drives and tailored for Linux laptop 
and notebook installations (you may find tools to resize your partitions as 
well as PCMCIA support and more).</p> 
<p> Damn Small Linux (DSL) is a business-card size (50MB) Live CD Linux 
distribution. Despite its minuscule size it strives to have a functional and 
easy to use desktop.</p> 
<h2>3.4.11. Installing via Network Interface</h2> 
<p> On most modern laptops and notebooks with integrated network card, a 
network installation via the PXE protocol is easy to achieve. This comes in 
handy especially if there is no CD or DVD drive available.</p> 
<h3>3.4.11.1. How to Prepare the Source Machine</h3> 
<p> For my installation I have used a Knoppix CD in the source machine. Just 
enable the Terminal Server (KNOPPIX-&gt;Server-Dienste-&gt;Terminal-Server 
KNOPPIX-Services-Start-&gt; KNOPPIX Terminal Server) For almost any laptop 
model the default network drivers should work. Disable secure options, 
otherwise you will not be able to become the root user on the target machine. 
Besides using Knoppix, there are numerous ways to prepare the source machine 
for PXE. I haven't checked the EtherBoot protocol yet, but this might work too.
</p> 
<h3>3.4.11.2. How to Prepare the Target Machine</h3> 
<p> Look up the BIOS for something like a NetBoot Option and set it on. Boot 
the machine and choose booting from the network device. This is usually 
achieved by pressing a certain key during boot up or by pre-selecting the 
network interface as the boot device in the BIOS. Now Knoppix should come up. 
Open a shell and do an<b>su</b> to become root. To achieve a hard disk 
installation do either<b>knx-hdinstall</b> for Knoppix &lt;=3.3 or <b>
knoppix-installer</b> for Knoppix &gt;=3.3. </p> 
<h2>3.4.12. Installing via VNC</h2> 
<p> You might ask why do a laptop installation via the VNC protocol? Indeed I 
know only of one reason to do so. Imagine you want to use a laptop with a 
broken keyboard you may use the keyboard of the remote machine to achieve the 
installation. Though you have to do a few key stroke to initiate the VNC 
installation! You have to prepare the source machine accordingly (instructions 
how to do so will follow later). For recent SuSE versions the distribution is 
already prepared, see the handbook for details.</p> 
<h2>3.4.13. Installing Linux on Small Machines</h2> 
<p> If you have less than 8MB memory and want to install via NFS you may get 
the message &quot;fork: out of memory&quot;. To handle this problem, use<b>fdisk
</b> to make a swap partition (<b>fdisk</b> should be on the install floppy or 
take one of the mini Linuxes described above). Then try to boot from the 
install floppy again. Before configuring the NFS connection change to another 
console (for instance by pressing &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;F2&gt;) and issue<b>swapon 
/dev/xxx</b> (xxx = swap partition ). Thanks to Thomas Schmaltz. </p> 
<p> Bruce Richardson has written the 4MB-Laptop-HOWTO on installing a modern 
Linux distribution (specifically Slackware 7.0) onto laptops with 4MB RAM and 
&lt;= 200MB hard disks. Another HOWTO isGetting Linux into Small Machines - 
HOWTO by L.C. Benschop. </p> 
<h2>3.4.14. Installing Linux on Apple Macintosh PowerBooks and iBooks</h2> 
<p> Macintosh PowerBooks these days come with a CD/DVD drive but not a floppy 
drive, but the Linux distributions for PPC support booting and installation off 
of a CD without any need for a floppy.</p> 
<p> Sometimes, when you boot the installer on the PowerBooks, the screen is 
black; this is easily fixed by tapping the brightness key on the keyboard 
(somehow, the screen brightness gets reset to zero).</p> 
<p> If you have a very recent PowerBook, it may not be supported by the kernel 
on the installation CD. You can get around this by booting off of a recent 
kernel downloaded onto your hard drive and using a ramdisk on the CD or hard 
drive, while still loading the installation packages from the CD (the default). 
(See the instructions available online for yaBoot or BootX, the Linux/PPC boot 
loaders; yaBoot is currently better-supported on the newest machines.)</p> 
<p> They can also boot/install from the Macintosh (HFS) partition on the 
internal hard disk.</p> 
<p> This part is a courtesy of Steven G. Johnson. </p>

</p> 
<h2>3.4.15. Mass Installation</h2> 
<h3>3.4.15.1. 2.5&quot; to 3.5&quot; IDE Adapter</h3> 
<p> If you have a 2,5&quot; to 3,5&quot; IDE drive adapter you can install one 
of the laptops, and with a desktop computer clone this harddisk to the disks of 
the other 99 laptops. You can use the DOS utility GHOST (works pretty with 
ext2) or with tar if the desktop works in linux. You only need an additional 
boot disk for the reinstall of the<b>lilo</b> in each laptop and change the 
hostname and IP address. These adapter are usually quite cheap (app . ten 
dollar, but difficult to get) .</p> 
<h3>3.4.15.2. SystemImager</h3> 
<p> VA SystemImager is software that makes the installation of Linux to masses 
of similar machines relatively easy. It also makes software distribution, 
configuration, and operating system updates easy. You can even update from one 
Linux release version to another! VA SystemImager can also be used for content 
management on web servers. It is most useful in environments where you have 
large numbers of identical machines. Some typical environments include: 
Internet server farms, high performance clusters, computer labs, or corporate 
desktop environments where all workstations have the same basic hardware 
configuration.</p> 
<h3>3.4.15.3. Debian/GNU Linux</h3> 
<p> You might want to take a look at FAI - Fully Automatic Installation. </p> 
<h3>3.4.15.4. SuSE</h3> 
<p> The package ALICE - Automatic Linux Installation and Configuration 
Environment, offers CVS-based configuration files and configuration templates.
</p> 
<h3>3.4.15.5. Replicator</h3> 
<p> Replicator is a set of scripts to automate the duplication of a Debian 
GNU/Linux installation from one computer to another. Replicator makes an effort 
to take into account differences in hardware (like HD size, video card) and in 
software configuration (such as partitioning). After the initial configuration, 
the scripts will create a bootdisk that allows you to completely (re)install a 
Debian box by booting from the floppy and answering a yes/no question.</p> 
<h3>3.4.15.6. bpbatch</h3> 
<p> Also bpbatch seems to be a good alternative. </p> 
<h3>3.4.15.7. partimage</h3> 
<p> Partition Image is a Linux/UNIX utility which saves partitions in the 
ext2fs (the linux standard), ReiserFS (a new journalized and powerful file 
system) or FAT16/32 (MS-DOS and MS-Windows file systems) file system format to 
an image file. The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to 
save disk space, and splitted into multiple files to be copied on floppies (ZIP 
for example).</p> 
<h1>3.5. Common Problems During Installation</h1> 
<h2>3.5.1. Display Problems (Missing Lines, Thick Borders)</h2> 
<p> A common problem during Linux installation (or afterwards) on laptops are 
missing lines at the bottom of the text console display, so the last command 
lines or the login prompt are not shown on the screen. Depending on the problem 
it might help:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Either using FrameBuffer, e.g. using a Kernel with framebuffer support and 
a boot option like<b>vga=791</b>, for details see the FrameBuffer-HOWTO. </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Or disabling FrameBuffer, e.g. using a boot option like <b>vga=normal</b> 
or another resolution Also, you could try passing<b>video=vga16:off</b> on the 
installer boot prompt.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> As a workaround often it is possible to switch to a second console e.g. 
&lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;F2&gt; , because this effect is often only related to the first 
console.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check if there are VGA and video boot options configured in the bootloader 
(e.g. grub, lilo). Try to disable them at least partly, look for options like<b>
ywrap</b>, etc. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Check the BIOS for display settings, often (older) Toshiba laptops behave 
like this.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Issue the command <b>resize</b> to get the correct screen size into the 
system.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> If none of the above helps, you may try to run a start-up-script, which 
has to run at the end of the boot process. The script has to contain the<b>clear
</b> command and/or the <b>reset</b>. </p></li> </ul>

<h1>Chapter 5. History of Linux on PDAs</h1> 
<p> This chapter is not complete yet, there should be more information on 286 
based PDAs which were Linux capable.</p> 
<h1>5.1. Itsy</h1> 
<p> The Itsy prototype offered considerably more computing power and memory 
than other PDAs of its time, enabling demanding applications such as speech 
recognition. It was designed as an open platform to facilitate innovative 
research projects. The base Itsy hardware provided a flexible interface for 
adding a custom daughtercard, and Itsy software has been based on the Linux OS 
and standard GNU tools.</p>

<h1>Chapter 6. Linux PDAs</h1> 
<p> The most known Linux PDAs in these days are the Agenda VR3 by 
AgendaComputing (out-of-production), theiPAQ by HP/COMPAQ, the Zaurus series by 
SHARP, and theYopy by Samsung (out-of-production). Except the iPAQ all of them 
are true Linux PDAs, they are pre-equipped with Linux by their manufacturers.
</p> 
<p> There are different free distributions for Linux PDAs available, e.g.: QT 
Embedded (pre-installed on the SHARP Zaurus), Opie, Familiar. The Gnome Palmtop 
Environment - GPE aims to provide a Free Software GUI environment for 
palmtop/handheld computers running the GNU/Linux operating system. GPE uses the 
X Window System, and the GTK+ widget toolkit.</p> 
<p> Most of the software for the newer PDAs can be obtained as pre-compiled 
IPK packages. You may search theZaurus Software Index - ZSI or ipkgfind for the 
package you need. To install these packages you may choose different methods. 
One method is to install directly via a HTTP connection called<em>feed</em>. 
For an example see theTuxMobil IPK feed. </p> 
<p> Besides these well-known Linux PDAs I will also try to point to ports for 
other PDAs and to tools to achieve connectivity to non-Linux PDAs, cell phones 
and desktop computers.</p>

<p></p> 
<h2>6.3.1. The SHARP System</h2> 
<p> You may find the official site for information about Linux on the Zaurus at
SHARP Japan (in Japanese). You can get the official kernel, either complete or 
just the patches for the Zaurus there. You can also get the official 
root-filesystem, that is the initrd, but without theQTopia environment. Check 
the documentation at SHARP how to create your zImage, bootflag and initrd for 
flashing the ROM of the Zaurus with your custom setup. Or go to your 
country-specific division of SHARP to get a complete ROM in one file called 
&quot;ospack&quot;, which isZaurus.DE for Germany or MyZaurus for the US 
versions. The kernel is rather old: 2.4.6 with 2.4.6-rmk2-patches and some more 
fromLineo. The rmk-patches are from Linux ARM Community. The root filesystem 
from SHARP is known for its weird structure with symbolic links all over the 
place. The custom compile worked. Remember to hit the &quot;/&quot;-key when 
the Zaurus displays &quot;Wait... &quot;, so you can choose to start a login 
instead of QTopia, which is not available then. Unless you downloaded QTopia, 
(cross-)compiled it and installed it into the root filesystem. BTW, you can 
create a new user with &quot;adduser&quot;, a command provided by BusyBox.
BusyBox , provides nearly all UNIX-commands available on the official system. 
</p> 
<h2>6.3.2. The Community Systems</h2> 
<p> Currently I know of two running systems: OpenZaurus and Debian 
(unofficial).</p> 
<h3>6.3.2.1. OpenZaurus</h3> 
<p> OpenZaurus tries to create the same environment as the one from SHARP, but 
based upon free software only. At the moment, it still uses the old kernel from 
Sharp, but slightly modified in regards of usage of the FLASH-ROM as RAM and 
division of RAM between RAMDISK and RAM. Unfortunately, the driver for the 
SD-controller is binary-only and thus non-free. But also SHARP itself tries to 
convince the vendor, SDCA, to provide the sources for the public. Moreover,
OpenZaurus created a sane root-filesystem we all know from our regular Linux 
systems. It also replaces QTopia byOpen Palmtop Integrated Environment - OPIE , 
which is a fork from QTopia with no relations to Trolltech anymore. All 
applications from QTopia should run on OPIE, but not quite: The Doom-like game 
called Zraycast does not run on OPIE, but does on QTopia (more or less). You 
can download a ready zimage, bootflag and initrd directly or checkout the 
sources from CVS. The downloaded images worked fine.</p> 
<h3>6.3.2.2. Debian</h3> 
<p> The current, unofficial version of Debian Zaurus really tries to be a 
regular Debian system with apt and X. A simple version of dpkg is already 
shipped withBusyBox , which makes it a little bit easier. The maintainer has 
therefore stripped down some more tools to fit them into the Flash-ROM. It uses 
the kernel provided byOpenZaurus and thus the one from Sharp. There are some 
issues with the RAMdisk, calibration of the stylus and sleep / power-off/-on. 
As soon as it is in a more stable state, it will join forces withEmDebian and 
the sources will become available (probably already furnished upon request). 
The downloaded images still have to be tweaked. :) All systems, including the 
sources from SHARP, are set to use the US keyboard layout (or the German 
keyboard). It seems that the keymap available is fixed in the kernel and there 
are no user-space tools installed per default to change this. Perhaps I will 
give the package &quot;console-tools&quot; on Debian a try.</p> 
<h3>6.3.2.3. PocketWorkStation</h3> 
<p> Here are some of the features of PocketWorkStation a Debian/GNU Linux 
distribution for PDAs:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Full Debian GNU/Linux operating environment, with easy access to the many 
GB of available software. Want the Konqueror web browser and have 50MB free 
space on your SD card? Run<b>apt-get install konqueror</b>, go eat lunch and 
come back to find it ready to run. No porting needed.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Includes X11 able to run most Linux applications - it supports virtual 
screens larger than the physical screen, realtime anti-aliased scaling and 
rotation, 3-mouse-button emulation and a full keyboard (useful i.e. if you need 
to send Ctrl-Alt-Del to an application).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> VNC client fbvnc (same features as X11 above) - remote administer your NT 
box from your Zaurus.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Runs completely out of a single directory (a 256MB SD card is ideal), no 
re-flashing or modification of the existing operating system is required.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Switch between QTopia and X11 whenever you like without rebooting or 
needing to stop any of your X11 applications.</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>6.3.3. Synchronization with your Linux PC</h2> 
<p> The QTopia-Desktop is available as a download from Trolltech for free (as 
in beer): There is aFAQ, which explains the necessary steps for setup 
(Ethernet-over-USB). It is not quite up-to-date, because SHARP has tightened 
the security with their current ROM-release, so you have to give the IP-address 
192.168.129.1 to your usb0 network device. You have to download and compile a 
patch for your kernel to use the driver usbdnet (see aforementioned website). 
Afterwards, a connection between the QTopia-Desktop and the Zaurus is possible. 
I had a lot of problems with the usb network layer on my system and could not 
sync properly. A switch from the driver uhci to usb-uhci for my host dit it. 
Just recently I had to reboot my notebook and the Zaurus due to a hiccup in the 
corresponding usb-net drivers. The network via an ethernet-card in the CF-slot 
is much more reliable than the connection via usb and you can still use the 
keyboard. The disadvantage is, that you cannot have a storage device in your 
CF-slot while you are on-line.</p> 
<h2>6.3.4. External Serial Keyboard</h2> 
<p> So far I was not able to get it going. There is a site which offers a 
serial keyboard driver and a patch for the iPAQ . Since the iPAQ and the Zaurus 
are based on the same CPU architecture, StrongArm, I hope that the driver 
provided there will also work on the Zaurus. You also need a user-space tool 
called<b>inputattach</b>, which you can also get from there (source or binary 
for ARM). I got a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite with a PS/2 connector. An adaptor 
translates to serial which itself is plugged into to the Collie serial 
&lt;-&gt; serial connector. I do not know if this chain is even possible to 
work. The provided patch applied with only one failing hunk which made a 
trivial change in the sources (include/linux/serio.h) necessary; check the 
output. After having re-configured the SHARP kernel config and having compiled 
the modules, I transferred them to the Zaurus. The modules marked and created 
are: newtonkbd.o, serio.o, serport.o and perhaps stowaway.o from 
drivers/char/joystick/ and input.o and keybdev.o from drivers/input/. When you 
start<b>inputattach</b>, you have to use the line <b>inputattach --newtonkbd 
/dev/ttyS0</b>, _not_ ttySA0 as stated on the website. For some strange reason, 
the Collie serial driver does not comply to the official StrongARM 
documentation of the kernel, which states that the serial ports are accessible 
via /dev/ttySAx. And because the serial_collie.o is already compiled into the 
Sharp kernel, you do not have to load the generic module serial.o. Well, I also 
tried the serial_collie.o as a module, while it was still compiled into the 
kernel. There were no complaints when loading it, but the system froze 
unpredictably, so I had to do a soft-reset quite often. Why can I load a module 
whose code is already in the kernel, I wonder... Anyway, it does not work. :( I 
tried inputattach in the --dump mode (you have to undefine a variable in the 
source and recompile) and it seems that there is nothing happening between the 
serial port and the keyboard. The call for select (man 2 select) fails due to a 
timeout.</p> 
<h2>6.3.5. Cross-Compiling</h2> 
<h3>6.3.5.1. Kernel</h3> 
<p> In order to build the kernel, initrd and applications you need a 
cross-compiling environment, GCC is preferred.EmDebian offers .deb packages for 
Debian GNU/Linux i386. Note: you have to look up the download links in the old 
site (a link is provided on the new site), because they are missing on the new 
site (though the download page exists). There are some dependancy problems with 
the g++ and libstdc++-dev packages which can be &quot;resolved&quot; with a 
--force-depends. The package libstdc++-dev has some problems finding an 
info-file: just create a symlink from/usr/share/info/iostream.ifo.gz to 
/usr/share/info/iostream-295.info.gz. You should get some pointers for other 
systems at theLinux ARM Community. Once installed, you can grab a standard 
kernel, apply the current ARM-patches and modify the top Makefile to target the 
arm-architecture. I did not try that so far.</p> 
<h3>6.3.5.2. Applications</h3> 
<p> Check the QTopia pages for more info and the QTopia - Development pages. 
Or check the instructions fromOPIE. </p> 
<h3>6.3.5.3. Tool Chains</h3> 
<p> Werner Schulte provides an OPIE development Live CD. The CD contains an 
ISO image with the tools and methods described in hisHOWTO - LiveCD chapter. 
The CD allows the user to crosscompile OPIE programs without having a 
cross-compiler installed on his linux-box (also i386 embedded available).</p>

OS X. </p> 
<p> A DemoLinux distribution to show the Trolltech Qtopia development 
environment for the SHARP Zaurus Personal Mobility Tool or any ARM based device 
running the Trolltech QPE system provided by Pellico Systems.</p> 
<p> Zaurus Development with Damn Small Linux offers a cross-development 
environment to build binaries for the ARM processor used in the SHARP Zaurus 
Linux PDAs. You may run it either inside the QEMU virtual machine or from a 
Live CD.</p> 
<p> KernelKit is a Knoppix derivative dedicated to developers of Linux device 
drivers and Free Software embedded systems. In particular, it includes uClibc 
cross-compiling toolchains for several embedded architectures (currently ARM, 
i386, MIPS, mipsel, PPC, and m68k) and emulators (currently qemu and SkyEye). 
It can be used for demonstration or training purposes, or by developers who 
cannot install GNU/Linux on their workstations.</p> 
<h2>6.3.6. Caveats</h2> 
<p> SHARP introduced a proprietary serial interface at the bottom of the 
Zaurus SL-5x00 series. You can buy an adaptor to a regular serial interface 
from them, but unfortunately, the plug is very thick and you cannot open the 
slide for the keyboard anymore. Hopefully, you can still plug an external 
keyboard into this port! You can at least plug the power cord into the adaptor 
so you do not have to run on battery. There are third-party adaptors available, 
which overcome this caveat.</p> 
<p> There is no speaker for the soundchip of the SL-5500. You have to use the 
socket for the headphones to hear OggVorbis and the alikes. The buzzer 
currently supports only 14 different sounds defined in
&lt;kernel-source&gt;/include/asm-arm/sharp_char.h , check for <b>
SHARP_BUZ_ALL_SOUNDS</b>. </p>

<h2>7.2.2. Braille Terminal</h2> 
<p> Stephane Doyon wrote to the iPAQ mailing list: &quot;We (Nicolas Pitre and 
myself) have successfully ported BRLTTY to the iPaq and tested the setup by 
interfacing with a BrailleLite 18 through the serial port. BRLTTY is a program 
that allows access to the Linux text-mode console using various brands of 
Braille displays. The BrailleLite is a small electronic Braille notetaker 
device which can act as a small refreshable Braille display. It also has keys 
so I can not only read but also type. So there's just the iPaq and the 
BrailleLite device (with a horrible cable in between) and that's all I need to 
fully use the console on the iPaq (in text-mode). A pretty powerful setup, yet 
very small. At the Ottawa Linux Symposium in July, using a network card in my 
iPaq and borrowing the internet connection they supplied, I was actually able 
to logon to the net and go read my E-mail, using ssh, pine and lynx! It should 
be possible to duplicate this setup with other Braille display models or other 
PDAs.&quot;</p>

<h1>Chapter 9. Tablet PCs / Pen PCs</h1> 
<h1>9.1. Introduction</h1> 
<p> Tablet PCs are a special kind of notebooks. Usually without keyboard (or 
equipped with an external and remote keyboard), they feature a touchscreen 
(therefore they were also named Pen PCs) and access to wireless LAN. In a 
certain sense they can be compared with PDAs. Microsoft has created a special 
edition of their operating system for Tablet PCs and published a so-called 
specification. In 2003 the first Tablet PCs according to this specification 
entered the market. Though there have been appropriate devices with Linux many 
years before. See thesurvey of Linux touch screen laptops and the survey of 
Linux laptops with detachable displays and finally a survey about Linux on 
Tablet PCs, WebPads, NotePads and PenPCs. They are used for data acquisition in 
stores, in the field or in hospitals. Or as a book reader or webbrowser 
(therefore they are also named WebPads). Their hardware features require some 
dedicated Linux solutions.</p>

<p> The XFree86-Touch-Screen-HOWTO describes how to setup X11 for 
touchscreens. There is also a shortsurvey of Linux laptops, which feature a 
touchscreen and/or have a pen as an input device and a survey about Linux on 
Tablet PCs. </p> 
<h2>9.2.2. Screen Rotation</h2> 
<h3>9.2.2.1. X-Windows</h3> 
<p> Some XFree86 drivers support a rotation of the display content. Use this 
entry in the configuration file (DEGREE can become CW - 90 degree clockwise , 
CCW - 90 degree counterclockwise , UD - 180 degree upside down, but which 
options actually work depends on the drivers:</p> 
<pre> Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;DEGREE&quot; </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> From version 4.3 on XFree86 contains the RandR extension (X resize and 
Rotate Extension), which makes it possible to change the display resolution on 
the fly without restarting X11. The tool<b>xrandr</b> supports only resolution 
settings but no rotation. But the Tiny-X server by RandR developer Keith 
Packard (Xkdrive) implements all of the RandR features. But this is usually not 
included in the major distributions. CurrentlyX.Org doesn't seem to support 
rotate and resize.</p> 
<h3>9.2.2.2. Utilities</h3> 
<p> There are some rotation utilities for Linux PDAs available, but I haven't 
tested them for Tablet PCs yet. Search theZaurus Software Index - ZSI. </p> 
<h1>9.3. Handwriting Recognition</h1> 
<p> xstroke is a full-screen gesture recognition program written for the X 
Window System. It captures gestures that are performed with a pointer device, 
(such as a mouse, a stylus, or a pen/tablet), recognizes the gestures and 
performs actions based on the gestures. xstroke has been developed on Linux 
systems, (i386 and StrongARM), but should be quite portable to any UNIX-like 
system with X.</p> 
<p> Xscribble is an X application that allows a user of a touch screen to 
input characters into X applications, using a uni-stroke (Graffiti like) 
alphabet. It uses the X test extension to allow synthesis of characters as 
though they had been typed on a keyboard. Though it was designed for Linux on 
PDAs it might work with Tablet PCs as well.</p> 
<p> Yudit is a Unicode text editor for the X Window System. It can do True 
Type font rendering, printing, transliterated keyboard input, and handwriting 
recognition with no dependencies on external engines. Its conversion utilities 
can convert text between various encodings. Keyboard input maps can also act 
like text converters.</p> 
<h1>9.4. Keyboard</h1> 
<h2>9.4.1. Soft Keyboard / On Screen Keyboard</h2> 
<h3>9.4.1.1. xvkbd</h3> 
<p> xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X which provides a 
facility to enter characters onto other clients software by clicking a keyboard 
displayed on the screen. It also has facility to send characters specified as 
the command line option to other client.</p> 
<h3>9.4.1.2. GNOME On-screen Keyboard (GOK)</h3> 
<p> The GNOME On-screen Keyboard (GOK) is a dynamic on-screen keyboard for 
UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. It features Direct Selection, Dwell 
Selection, Automatic Scanning and Inverse Scanning access methods and includes 
word completion.</p> 
<h2>9.4.2. Remote Keyboard</h2> 
<p> Some Tablet PCs are equipped with a remote keyboard. Data between keyboard 
and Tablet PC may be interchanged via InfraRed, BlueTooth or other means. If 
these solutions are hardware based only, they should work easily with Linux. 
Otherwise you probably need the technical specifications from the manufacturer.
</p> 
<h2>9.4.3. Virtual Keyboard</h2> 
<p> There are different approaches for virtual (non physical) keyboards. 
Whether they work with Linux or not I could not verify yet.</p>

<h1>Chapter 10. Mobile (Cellular) Phones, Pagers</h1> 
<p> You may find a Linux compatibility survey of mobile phones at TuxMobil. 
This survey contains also links to useful applications and to mobile phones 
driven by the Linux operating system.</p> 
<h1>10.1. Mobile (Cellular) Phones</h1> 
<h2>10.1.1. Connectivity to Mobile (Cellular) Phones with non-Linux Operating 
System</h2> 
<p> For NOKIA cellular phones see GNOKII project. And Linux Nserver. This 
project aims to produce a GPL replacement for Nokia's Windows Nserver, and 
maybe improve upon it along the way. Initially it will emulate the Windows 3.1 
version (ie. allow backup, restore and install).</p> 
<p> openWAP is an open source project for the implementation of the Wireless 
Application Protocol (WAP) for use with browsers, servers and tools. WAP is 
used by PDA devices, cell phones, pagers and other wireless devices to transmit 
internet content to these devices. The project is still in its early stages and 
nothing can be downloaded yet.</p> 
<p> GSMLIB is a library to access GSM mobile phones through GSM modems. 
Features include: modification of phonebooks stored in the mobile phone or on 
the SIM card, reading and writing of SMS messages stored in the mobile phone, 
sending and reception of SMS messages. Additionally, some simple command line 
programs are provided to use these features.</p> 
<p> Kannel is an open source WAP gateway. It attempts to provide this 
essential part of the WAP infrastructure freely to everyone so that the market 
potential for WAP services, both from wireless operators and specialized 
service providers, will be realized as efficiently as possible.</p> 
<p> Kannel also works as an SMS gateway for GSM networks. Almost all GSM 
phones can send and receive SMS messages, so this is a way to serve many more 
clients than just those using a new WAP phone.</p> 
<h2>10.1.2. Mobile (Cellular) Phones with a Linux Operating System</h2> 
<p> There are some mobile phones with Linux operating system available. As 
well asLinux distributions for mobile (cell) phones. </p> 
<h1>10.2. Pagers - SMS Messages</h1> 
<p> QuickPage is a client/server software package that enables you to send 
messages to an alphanumeric pager. The client accepts a message from the user 
and forwards it to a server using SNPP. The server uses a modem to transmit the 
message to the recipient's paging service using the TAP protocol (also known as 
the IXO protocol).</p> 
<p> mail2sms converts a (MIME) mail to a short message, allowing 
search/replace, conditional rules, date/time dependent actions, customizing the 
output format, etc. The output defaults to 160 characters, which is perfectly 
suitable for sending the text to a GSM telephone as an SMS message. This 
software does not include any code for actually sending the text to anything 
else but another program or stdout.</p> 
<p> email2sms is a filter written in Perl which converts an e-mail into a form 
suitable for sending as an SMS message. Its main advantage over the 
alternatives is that it uses the CPAN module<em>Lingua::EN::Squeeze</em> to 
compress the text down to as little as 40% of its original size, so you can get 
much more of your e-mail into the 160 character limit imposed by SMS. It is 
fully MIME compatible, and has many configurable options, including removal of 
quoted text. Ideal for use with procmail. A Perl script for sending the output 
to a typical e-mail to SMS web gateway is included.</p> 
<p> SMSLink implements a client/server gateway to the SMS protocol. It 
requires the use of dedicated hardware though (a serial GSM module). Both SMS 
emission and reception are supported. The server only runs under Linux at the 
present time and also supports interactive mode via<b>telnet</b>. The 
command-line client already exists for Linux, Solaris and HP-UX. A basic web 
interface is provided. A Win32 client is in the works.</p> 
<p> nmsms is a very simple program to announce incoming email to an SMS 
address (email address) defined at compile time. The original<em>From:</em> and 
<em>Subject:</em> header are included in each mail announced. </p> 
<p> mepl is a software for 3COM/USRobotics Messagemodems to control the 
self-employed-mode. This program can be used for downloading the messages and 
saving or mailing them in gsm or fax-format.</p>

calculator screen and do remote control.</p> 
<h1>11.3. Wearable Computing</h1> 
<p> Also related to Linux and mobile computers seems wearable computing. </p> 
<p> See also MIT , Wearables Central and WearComp . </p> 
<p> Sulawesi was developed due to the problems running a desktop GUI on a 
wearable computer. It has been designed and implemented to tackle what has been 
considered to be important challenges in a wearable user interface, the ability 
to accept input from any number of input devices, such as machine vision, 
speech recognition, portable keyboards, GPS devices, infra-red, etc. and to 
allow services to manipulate the information and generate a suitable output 
such as speech generation, graphics using a headmounted display, vibrotactile 
stimuli, etc. The<em>Gili</em> user interface has been updated, more 
documentation has been added, and the<em>Spatial Reminder</em> has been 
introduced.</p> 
<h1>11.4. Watches</h1> 
<p> The datalink library allows sending information to the Timex DataLink 
watches. The original datalink library supports the DataLink models 70 , 150 
and 150 S watch and has been extended to work with the DataLink Ironman 
Triathlon watch. It has been tested with the SVGA output on the Ironman watch 
only, other output devices and other watches may or may not work, I have no 
reports either way. The display must be a CRT display (not aLCD). </p>

<h1>Chapter 12. Hardware in Detail: CPU, Display, Keyboard, Sound and More</h1>
<h1>12.1. Introduction</h1> 
<p> The following text about mobile hardware, is applicable to all kinds of 
mobile devices running Linux: laptops, notebook, PDAs, handheld PCs, mobile 
phones, wearables and more. Though sometimes you have to make the appropriate 
changes.</p> 
<h1>12.2. BIOS</h1> 
<p> Before setting up any hardware you should have a look into the BIOS. Often 
you may find a solution already there, e.g. options to set up the display, APM 
or ACPI, DMA, IrDA, PCMCIA, sound, SpeedStep, and more.</p> 
<p> If you run into unresolvable trouble when configuring the hardware, try a 
BIOS upgrade from the manufacturer. For this task you usually need one of the 
Microsoft so-called operating systems. Or at least a DOS disk or CD.</p> 
<p> Flashing BIOSes has become often quite complex as both DOS and floppies 
are fading away. Things aren't any easier when running exclusively GNU/Linux. 
Luckily, it is possible tocreate a bootable CD-ROM with GNU/Linux, which 
enables one to actually flash a BIOS using a DOS utility without requiring 
Windows, MS-DOS or a floppy drive.</p> 
<p> Some newer laptops e.g. ASUS M5200A are equipped with a BIOS, which is 
able to update itself.</p> 
<p> The Motherboard Flash Boot CD from Linux Mini HOWTO gives a short summary 
of how to create a boot disk to flash a BIOS on a PC, from Linux (or another 
Unix) when one has no floppy drive and no access to a DOS/Windows machine.</p> 
<p> LinuxBIOS aims to replace the normal BIOS found on PCs, Alphas, and other 
machines with a Linux kernel that can boot Linux from a cold start. LinuxBIOS 
is primarily Linux - about 10 lines of patches to the current Linux kernel. 
Additionally, the startup code - about 500 lines of assembly and 5000 lines of 
C - executes 16 instructions to get into 32-bit mode and then performs DRAM and 
other hardware initialization required before Linux can take over. There are 
even two reports about LinuxBIOS on laptops.</p> 
<p> Alternative approaches are OpenBIOS and FreeBIOS. </p> 
<h2>12.2.1. SMBios</h2> 
<p> Desktop Management Interface (DMI) Standards generate a standard framework 
for managing and tracking components in a desktop pc, notebook or server. DMI 
was the first desktop management standard. The DMI Home Page is a repository of 
all DMI-related information from the specification to tools to support to the 
Product Registry of DMI-certified products.</p> 
<p> Dmidecode reports information about your system's hardware as described in 
your system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard (see a sample output). 
This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial 
number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying 
level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will 
often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, 
ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, 
USB).</p> 
<p> There is also an alternative implementation of a DMI table decoder. 
Libsmbios is a cross-platform library intended to be used to obtain common 
information available in a BIOS using a unified API. Currently, it can 
programmatically access any information in the SMBIOS tables. It also has the 
ability to obtain Dell system-specific information such as the Dell System ID 
number, service tag, and asset tag. Future plans include APIs for $PIR and 
mptable mapping. There is a C API for some of the more commonly used functions, 
and example binaries to show off most of the facilities.</p> 
<h1>12.3. CPU</h1> 
<p> You may find a survey about CPUs used in mobile devices, which are 
Linux-supported in the chapterChapter 1 Which Laptop to Buy? above. </p> 
<h2>12.3.1. SpeedStep</h2> 
<p> Speedstep is a feature of recent CPUs made by Intel, which lets you set 
CPU frequency. There are different Linux tools to get this to work. Similar 
features are also available for other CPUs from AMD or the StrongARM CPU, I 
will describe this in a later issue (assistance welcome).</p> 
<p> Before configuring SpeedStep have a look into the BIOS options. </p> 
<h3>12.3.1.1. SpeedStep Tool</h3> 
<p> The SpeedStep tool works with Mobile Pentium-III CPUs only. See output from
<b>cat /proc/cpuinfo</b>: </p> 
<pre> model name : Intel(R) Pentium(R) III Mobile CPU 1000MHz </pre> <br>
<br>

 It does not work with the mobile version of the Pentium-III: 
<pre> model name : Pentium III (Coppermine) </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h3>12.3.1.2. CPUFREQ</h3> 
<p> You might want to check into the cpufreq patch for the linux-2.4/2.5 
kernels, maybe it works for your machine: CPU clock frequency scaling for 
Linux, on x86 and ARM based processors. This module provides a user-space and 
standard kernel-space interface to this feature, along ARM system-on-a-chip 
devices to cope with processor clock changes. Since the power consumed by a 
processor is directly related to the speed at which it is running, keeping the 
clock speed as low as possible allows you to get more run-time out of your 
battery. Some people use this to adjust their clock speed many times a second 
to optimise performance vs battery life. See also theCVS repository . </p> 
<h4>12.3.1.2.1. cpufreqd</h4> 
<p> cpufreqd is meant to be a replacement of the speedstep applet you can find 
on some other operating systems, it monitors battery level, AC state and 
running programs and adjusts the frequency governor according to a set of rules 
specified in the config file. It works both with APM and ACPI.</p> 
<h4>12.3.1.2.2. cpudyn</h4> 
<p> cpudyn controls the speed in Intel SpeedStep and PowerPC machines with the 
cpufreq compiled in the kernel. It saves battery and lowers temperature, 
without affecting the performance of interactive applications.</p> 
<h4>12.3.1.2.3. cpuspeedy</h4> 
<p> cpuspeedy allows you to change the clock speed and voltage of CPUs using 
Linux's CPUFreq driver. It is a user space program, so it will work on every 
processor supported by the kernel's CPUFreq driver.</p> 
<h4>12.3.1.2.4. powernowd</h4> 
<p> PowerNowd is a simple client daemon for the Linux cpufreq driver using the 
sysfs interface. It sits in the background and changes CPU speed in 
configurable &quot;steps&quot; according to usage. Written in C, its emphasis 
is on speed and simplicity. It is very configurable, and supports non-x86 and 
SMP systems.</p> 
<h3>12.3.1.3. Laptop Mode</h3> 
<p> Laptop mode is a kernel &quot;mode&quot; that allows you to extend the 
battery life of your laptop. It does this by intelligently grouping write 
activity on your disks, so that only reads of uncached data result in a disk 
spinup. It has been reported to cause a significant improvement in battery life 
(for usage patterns that allow it).</p> 
<p> The Laptop Mode Tools package spins down your hard drive like noflushd, 
but it works also on journalling filesystems. It integrates with 
apmd/acpid/pbbuttonsd to enable this behaviour only when you are running on 
battery power. It also adjusts some hdparm settings and remounts your 
filesystems noatime, and it can adjust your maximum CPU frequency.</p> 
<h3>12.3.1.4. SONY VAIO SPIC Daemon</h3> 
<p> The SONY VAIO SPIC daemon is a fast and small hack to create a working 
apmd to Sony VAIO laptops. It uses the<b>sonypi</b> kernel module to detect the 
AC adapter status and the LCD backlight, and cpufreq for CPU frequency scaling.
</p> 
<h3>12.3.1.5. CPUIDLE</h3> 
<p> A software utility that will make your CPU run cooler? Sounds pretty 
strange, huh? Let me explain: Have you ever thought of the fact that your CPU 
is idle most of the time when you're using your computer? For example, when 
you're using your word processor, writing emails, browsing the web, the CPU 
does nothing else than just wait for user input. In fact, it will use up to 30W 
and produce substantial amounts of heat doing nothing. Good operating systems, 
like Linux, NT and OS/2 have a so-called &quot;idle loop&quot; - a loop that's 
always executed when the CPU has nothing to do. This loop consists of halt 
(HLT) instructions. CPUs like the AMD K6, the Cyrix 6x86 and 6x86MX have a 
special feature called &quot;suspend-on-halt&quot;. This means that everytime 
the CPU executes a hlt instruction, it will go into &quot;suspend mode&quot; 
for a short time. So, while the idle loop is being executed, the CPU will be in 
suspend mode, use much less power, and stay much cooler. Of course, this does 
not affect performance at all! The user won't even notice that his CPU is in 
suspend mode most of the time (unless he touches the heatsink).</p> 
<h3>12.3.1.6. autospeedstep</h3> 
<p> autospeedstep is a daemon that controls power consumption and processor 
speed depending of the CPU load. It works with Intel Speedstep CPUs and Linux 
kernels running the 2.5 ACPI backport.</p> 
<h3>12.3.1.7. ACPI</h3> 
<p> If you have enabled ACPI support in the Kernel you may also set the 
SpeedStep parameters via the/proc/apci/ interface, e.g. <b>echo 1 &gt; 
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance</b> will make the CPU speed down. Note: 
the spaces in the command are important! Note also: this feature is deprecated 
for Kernel &gt; 2.6.11. Or use this script provided by Sebastian Henschel.</p> 
<pre> #! /bin/sh # /etc/init.d/slowcpu: slow down cpu or accelerate it via 
speedstep test -e /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance || exit 0 case 
&quot;$1&quot; in start) echo &quot;Setting CPU0-Speed to: 733 MHz.&quot; echo 
1 &gt; /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance ;; stop) echo &quot;Setting 
CPU0-Speed to: 1133 MHz.&quot; echo 0 &gt; 
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance ;; force-reload|restart) ;; *) echo 
&quot;Usage: $0 {start|stop}&quot; exit 1 esac exit 0</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h1>12.4. Centrino</h1> 
<p> Intels Centrino(TM) technology consists of three parts: a Pentium M 
processor, a chipset, and a wireless module. Let's see how these parts are 
supported under Linux so far. For an official statement from Intel about Linux 
support, see theirOS compatibility survey. </p> 
<p> Here you may find current information about Linux on Centrino laptops and 
notebooks. </p> 
<h2>12.4.1. CPU: Pentium-M</h2> 
<p> According to Intel's OS compatibility survey , the Pentium M processor 
family is supported. Robert Freund has written a conciseHOWTO about controlling 
ACPI Centrino(TM) features via software in Linux. He describes how to control 
CPU frequency and other energy saving modes, as well as how to get information 
about the battery state.</p> 
<h2>12.4.2. Chipset: 855/915</h2> 
<p> The Intel 855/915 chipset families are designed to deliver better 
performance at lower power. The chipsets are available as discrete memory 
controller hub (e.g. Intel 855PM). Or as an integrated graphics and memory 
controller hub (e.g. Intel 855GM). Intel provides the Extreme Graphics driver 
for Linux, which includes AGP GART and DRM kernel modules as a binary files. I 
have no experience with this drivers, because the chipsets work with 
XFree86/X.org drivers, too. The Pentium-M CPU may come accompanied with other 
graphics chipsets too, e.g. from ATI, nVIDIA or Trident.</p> 
<h2>12.4.3. Wireless LAN: PRO/wireless 2100/2200 LAN Mini-PCI Adapter</h2> 
<p> There are different solutions to get these cards running with Linux: 
drivers from Intel, NDIS wrapper and Linuxant driverloader (commercial).</p> 
<p> ipw2100, Intel's Open Source driver with included firmware, for the first 
Centrino generation (incl. WEP and WPA together with HostAP). For the second 
generation of Intel's miniPCI modules: PRO/Wireless 2200BG (802.11g/802.11i), 
theipw2200 project provides a driver. Third generation PRO/Wireless 2915ABG 
(IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g und 802.11a) miniPCI cards will be supported by the
ipw2200 project, too. </p> 
<p> Intel didn't provide drivers, when the begun to sell their Centrino 
technology. During this time there have been other solutions: Some vendors 
refuse to release technical specifications or even a binary Linux driver for 
their WLAN cards. NDIS wrapper tries to solve this by making a kernel module 
that can load NDIS (Microsoft-Windows Network Driver Interface Specification) 
drivers. Currently there are two implementations available. The commercial
Linuxant Driverloader supports a broad range of chipsets including Intel's 
PRO/Wireless 2100 LAN Mini-PCI Adapter. There is alsondiswrapper an Open Source 
solution by Pontus Fuchs.</p> 
<p> As another workaround was the usage of a Linux-supported miniPCI WLAN card
. These cards are difficult to get, but some desktop WLAN PCI cards contain 
miniPCI cards. Often it is a tedious task to build them into a laptop. Kernel 
maintainer Theodore Tytso has written amanual about achieving this task. You 
may also use a wireless PCMCIA or CF card instead. This solution may provide 
more flexibility, because you may use a PCMCIA or CF card in different devices 
and choose the Linux driver of your choice. You may also extend the wireless 
range by adding antennas to some cards. For Linux compatibility there is the
TuxMobil PCMCIA/CF Card Survey. In the future, manufacturers will probably 
offer alternative miniPCI solutions. DELL is already doing so for their 
Latitude D series.</p> 
<h2>12.4.4. Conclusion</h2> 
<p> Though Linux support is not yet complete, some features of the 
Centrino(TM) technology already make it worthwhile to take into account when 
buying your next laptop. Though the new CPUs are named so similarly to existing 
ones that some people mix them up, they are completely different inside. 
Compared to the Pentium-4 Mobile CPU, the Pentium-M will allow a smaller form 
factor for laptops, making them more portable and lighter. Because of their 
higher clockspeed, the Pentium-4 CPUs have produced too much heat to build them 
into slimline notebook cases. Therefore, very flat notebooks have only been 
available from Apple or with a Pentium III Mobile CPU. Also, the battery power 
the Pentium-M consumes for a given level of performance will decrease, but I do 
not have a benchmark about how much the savings actually are yet. PENN 
Computing offers a nicecomparison of Pentium-M and Pentium-4 Mobile. Note: The 
character M in Pentium-M suggests &quot;mobile&quot;. Therefore some people mix 
this kind of CPU with the mobile versions of the Pentium-III/Pentium-4 CPU.</p> 
<p> Laptops based on the Centrino(TM) features are already very popular in the 
Linux community.Installation reports for almost all Centrino based laptops 
available at TuxMobil.</p> 
<h1>12.5. PCMCIA Controller</h1> 
<h2>12.5.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> With the <b>probe</b> command, which is included in the PCMCIA-CS package 
by David Hinds you can get the type of thePCMCIA controller. Also available by 
the command<b>cat /proc/pci</b>. </p>

<p></p> 
<h2>12.5.3. PCMCIA Configuration - Survey</h2> 
<p> In the mailing lists where I'm a member, the question &quot;How can I set 
upPCMCIA support, after the Linux installation?&quot; comes up sometimes. 
Therefore I try to give a short survey. But the authoritative source for the 
latest information about the<em>PCMCIA Card Services for Linux</em>, including 
documentation, files, and genericPCMCIA information is the Linux PCMCIA 
Information Page . For problems with PCMCIA and APM see the chapter APM. </p> 
<h3>12.5.3.1. Software</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Install the newest available PCMCIA-CS package, if you take a rpm or deb 
package it is quite easy.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Read the PCMCIA HOWTO, usually included in the PCMCIA-CS package. </p></li>
<li>
<p> If necessary, install a new kernel. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Make sure your kernel has module support and PCMCIA support enabled (and 
oftenAPM support) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Make sure your kernel also includes support for the cards you want to use, 
e.g. network support for a NIC card, serial support for a modem card, SCSI 
support for a SCSI card and so on.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> If you have a custom made kernel, don't forget to compile the PCMCIA-CS 
source against your kernel.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>12.5.3.2. PCMCIA Controller</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Use the <b>probe</b> command to get information whether your PCMCIA 
controller is detected or not.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Edit the file /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia. It should include <b>PCMCIA=y</b> and 
the type of yourPCMCIA controller, e.g. <b>PCIC=i82365</b>. Since Kernel 2.6 
there is a standard driver<b>PCIC=yenta_socket</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Start the PCMCIA services typically via <b>/etc/init.d/pcmcia start</b>. 
If you get two high beeps, everything should be fine.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> If something doesn't work, check the messages in /var/log/messages . </p>
</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>12.5.3.3. PCMCIA Card</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Check your card with <b>cardctl ident</b> . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> If your card is not in /etc/pcmcia/config, edit the file 
/etc/pcmcia/&lt;MYCARD&gt;.conf appropriately. Take an entry in the first file 
as a model. You may try every driver, just in case it might work, for instance 
the<b>pcnet_cs</b> supports many NE2000 compatible PCMCIA network cards. Note: 
it is a bad practice to edit/etc/pcmcia/config directly, because all changes 
will be lost with the next update.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> A list of supported cards is included in the PCMCIA-CS package. The 
current list you may find atSUPPORTED.CARDS. </p>
<p> Since there are not all cards mentioned I have set up a PCMCIA Cards 
Survey of Cards Supported by Linux . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> If you use a X11 GUI, you can use <b>cardinfo</b> to insert, suspend, or 
restart aPCMCIA card via a nice graphical interface. </p></li> </ol>

<h1>12.6. Graphics Chip</h1> 
<h2>12.6.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<h3>12.6.1.1. Video Mode</h3> 
<p> Attention: The <b>SuperProbe</b> is deprecated. The tool <b>SuperProbe</b> 
is part of XFree86 and is able to check many graphics chips. Please read the 
documentation carefully, because it might crash your hardware. From<b>man 
SuperProbe</b>: </p> 
<p> &quot;<b>SuperProbe</b> is a program that will attempt to determine the 
type of video hardware installed in an EISA/ISA/VLB-bus system by checking for 
known registers in various combinations at various locations (MicroChannel and 
PCI machines may not be fully supported; many work with the use of the<b>
-no_bios</b> option). This is an error-prone process, especially on UNIX (which 
usually has a lot more esoteric hardware installed than MS-DOS system do), so<b>
SuperProbe</b> may likely need help from the user. </p> 
<p> At this time, <b>SuperProbe</b> can identify MDA, Hercules, CGA, MCGA, 
EGA, VGA, and an entire horde of SVGA chipsets (see the -info option, below). 
It can also identify several HiColor/True-color RAMDACs in use on SVGA boards, 
and the amount of video memory installed (for many chipsets). It can identify 
8514/A and some derivatives, but not XGA, or PGC (although the author intends 
to add those capabilities). Nor can it identify other esoteric video hardware 
(like Targa, TIGA, or Microfield boards).&quot;:</p> 
<p> For testing reasons start the X11 server with <b>X 2&gt; &lt;error.msg&gt;
</b>. And try to change the resolution by typing <b>
&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;+&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;-&gt;</b>. 
Note: the + or - sign have to be taken from the numeric pad, which can be 
emulated at the letter pad or with the<b>Fn</b> key by some laptops. </p> 
<h3>12.6.1.2. Text Mode</h3> 
<p> Just watch the display and determine if it works properly. If not, try to 
enable different video modes at startup time. Setting up X11 can sometimes be 
an exercise in trial and error.</p>

<p> You might discover that some features of your laptop are not supported by 
XFree86 or X.Org. , e.g. high resolutions, accelerated X or an external 
monitor. Therefore I give a survey of available X11 servers.</p>

<p> If you can't get an appropriate X11 server working, but cannot afford a 
commercial X11 server you may try the VGA16 or the mono server included in 
XFree86.</p> 
<h2>12.6.4. Resources</h2> 
<p> You may find a survey about current graphics chips used in laptops and 
notebooks at TuxMobil. </p> 
<h2>12.6.5. External Monitors: LCD, CRT, TV, Projector</h2> 
<p> There are several different methods to activate support for an external 
monitor: as a<em>BIOS option</em> or during runtime with a <em>keystroke</em> 
e.g.<b>&lt;Fn&gt;+&lt;F4&gt;</b>. </p> 
<p> Read the X11 docs about your graphics chip carefully, for instance for the 
NeoMagic NM20xx chips you have to edit/etc/XF86Config by configuring <b>
intern_disp</b> and <b>extern_disp</b>. Note: As far as I know these options 
are only valid for XFree86 3.3.x, for XFree86 4.x I couldn't find a similar 
option.</p> 
<p> If you can't get the external monitor to work with XFree86, try a demo 
version of the commercial X11 servers mentioned above. Also check with the 
RedHat and SuSE WWW sites as they may have new, binary-only, X11 servers that 
may work with your laptop. Or check X11 servers fromX.Org. </p> 
<h3>12.6.5.1. Tools</h3> 
<p> The atitvout utility may be used for executing several configuration 
commands for the TV Out connector of ATI Rage Mobility P/M graphics boards 
under GNU/Linux on x86. It is intended primarily to enable TV Out support after 
bootup and for switching the used TV standard from NTSC to PAL.</p> 
<p> s3switch will allow you to switch your display between the various output 
devices supported by the Savage (CRT, LCD, TV).</p> 
<p> nv-tv-out is a tool to enable TV-Out on Linux for NVidia cards. It does 
not need the kernel, supports multiple TV encoder chips. You may use all the 
features of the chip, down to direct register access, and all resolutions and 
sizes the chip supports.</p> 
<p> i810switch is an utility for switching the LCD and external VGA displays 
on and off, with almost every graphics chip from Intel's i8xx family, including 
Centrino.</p> 
<p> i855crt is an userspace driver that can enable the CRT out (port for 
external monitor) on Intel 855GM based laptops.</p> 
<h3>12.6.5.2. Solutions</h3> 
<p> Klaus Weidner has described a Dual monitor setup without using xinerama, 
but<b>x2vnc</b> instead. This approach allows to dymamically add and remove the 
second monitor without reconfiguring or restarting anything.</p> 
<h2>12.6.6. Miscellaneous</h2> 
<p> Sometimes you may encounter a display not working properly in text mode. 
Currently I don't have any recommendations, please seeKeyboard-and-Console-HOWTO
 .</p> 
<p> Take care of the <em>backlight</em> as far as I know this device can only 
bear a limited number of uptime circles. So avoid using screensavers too much.
</p> 
<p> For problems with X Windows and APM please see the APM chapter. </p> 
<p> vbetool uses LRMI in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently, it 
is able to alter DPMS states, save/restore video card state, and attempt to 
initialize the video card from scratch. It exists primarily in order to 
increase the chances of successfully recovering video state after an ACPI S3 
suspend-to-RAM.</p> 
<h1>12.7. DVI Port</h1> 
<p> As far as I know DVI ports don't work with Linux yet. But anyway here are 
links to installation reports aboutLinux on laptops and notebooks with DVI ports
.</p> 
<h1>12.8. Video Port / ZV Port</h1> 
<p> Some high end laptops come with a video or ZV port (NTSC/PAL). Since I 
don't have a laptop with a ZV or video port yet, I can provide only some URLs
BTTV (driver) xwintv (tvviewer). For further information see Video4Linux . To 
collect information about laptops with video port I have setup a page at
TuxMobil - Hardware . Alternatively to the ZV port you might use the USB port. 
</p> 
<h1>12.9. LCD Display</h1> 
<p> This chapter isn't ready yet, it will contain information about the 
lifetime of backlights, differences between CRT and LCD displays, anti-aliasing 
with LCD displays, theISO 13406-2 standard about pixel defects, a survey of 
common resolutions: VGA, SVGA, XGA and more soon. See also the screensaver 
chapter and the touchscreen section in the chapterPart III in <i>Linux on the 
Road</i> Tablet PC and PDA. </p> 
<h2>12.9.1. Laptop Displays</h2> 
<h3>12.9.1.1. Applications</h3> 
<p> lcdtest is a utility to display LCD monitor test patterns. It may be 
useful in finding pixels that are stuck on or off. lcdtest uses the SDL 
library, and has only been tested on Linux with X, but may work on other 
platforms.</p> 
<p> DDCcontrol is a program used to control monitor parameters, like 
brightness and contrast, by software, i.e. without using the OSD (On Screen 
Display) and the buttons in front of the monitor.</p> 
<h3>12.9.1.2. Fonts</h3> 
<p> fat8x16-x-font is a 8x16 pixel fixed width font to be used in physically 
small but high resolution displays. Such displays can be found for example in 
notebook computers with 1400x1050 and 1600x1200 14&quot; displays.</p> 
<h2>12.9.2. PDA Displays</h2> 
<p> pxl2000 is a free ISO 8859-15 (i.e. ISO 8859-1 with Euro symbol) encoded 
monowidth dot matrix typeface for the X Window system (X11). It is currently 
available in nine sizes: 4x8, 5x10, 6x12, 7x14, 8x16, 9x18, 10x20, 11x22 and 
12x24 pixels. It's design objectives are:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Readability; fitness to be used as a default screen font, especially on 
reverse-color X11 terminals</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Optimization for program code through visually distinct characters L, l, 
1, 7, |, I, i and 0, O and more.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Complete ISO 8859-15 character set. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Many point sizes to ensure optical consistency across different computers 
with different screen resolutions (encompassing anything from PDA displays to 
20&quot; screens).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Fitness for displaying ASCII art and codework/code poetry, from viewing 
graphics in aview, watching TV in ttv and DVDs in<b>mplayer</b> with <b>-vo aa
</b> to reading mailinglists like _arc.hive_, 7-11 and writing in <b>mutt</b>. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Clean, minimalist visual design; no serifs, a square minuscule base 
matrix, rounded edges. This is a computer terminal font; it should not look 
like a low-res imitation of print type.</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> The author Florian Cramer employs this font in his 
&quot;anti-desktop&quot; setup consisting of the<b>ratpoison</b> window manager 
and GNU screen inside an<b>rxvt</b> terminal (with reverse color and no 
scrollbars), similar to what is described in thisFreshMeat article . </p> 
<h1>12.10. Sound</h1> 
<h2>12.10.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> The only way I know to check this, is to compile the different sound 
drivers into the kernel and check whether they are detected or not. The best 
way to do so, is to compile them as modules because it's easier to load 
different parameters such as interrupts and IO ports this way. For the 2.2.x 
kernels, read/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound/Introduction by Wade Hampton. 
This document may help you get started with sound. Also, you might try one of 
the commercial sound drivers mentionend below. To check whether sound works or 
not you may try e.g.<b>xmms</b> and one of the sounds provided in 
/usr/share/sounds. </p>

<p> ALSA Advanced Linux Sound Architecture . The Advanced Linux Sound 
Architecture aims to: be a fully-modularized sound driver which supports

create anALSA Library (C,C++) which covers the ALSA Kernel API for 
applications, and createALSA Manager, an interactive configuration program for 
the driver. With Kernel 2.6 these modules will be part of the Linux Kernel.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> UNIX Sound System Lite / OSS provides commercial sound card drivers for 
most popular sound cards under Linux. These drivers support digital audio, 
MIDI, Synthesizers and mixers found on sound cards. These sound drivers comply 
with the Open Sound System API specification. OSS provides a user-friendly GUI 
which makes the installation of sound drivers and configuration of sound cards 
very simple. OSS supports over 200 brand name sound cards. OSS drivers provide 
automatic sound card detection, Plug-n-Play support, support for PCI audio 
soundcards and support.</p></li>

<h2>12.10.4. Additional Soundcards</h2> 
<p> VXPocket looks like a finally medium2high-end soundcard solution for 
onboardwise badly equipped laptops. Note: I didn't check whether this is aPCMCIA
 card or not.PCMCIA sound cards are probably not supported. </p> 
<p> Also USB may be an alternative. Most USB audio devices are supported by 
recent kernels. An example is Labtec Axis 712 Stereo Headset (headphones and 
microphone) which works in full-duplex mode. For more info about this and other 
Linux-compatible USB audio devices see theUSB Survey and my Mobile USB Linux 
Hardware Survey . </p>

<h1>12.11. Keyboard</h1> 
<h2>12.11.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> Usually there are no problems with Linux and the keyboard. Though there 
are two minor caveats: First the<b>setleds</b> program might not work. Second 
the key mapping might not fit your needs. SomeUNIX users and <b>vi</b> users 
expect to find the &lt;CONTROL&gt; key to the left of the &lt;A&gt; key. Many 
PC-type keyboards have the &lt;CAPS-LOCK&gt; key there. You may use<b>xmodmap
</b> or <b>loadkeys</b> to re-map the keyboard. Some laptops (e.g., Toshiba) 
allow you to swap the &lt;CAPS-LOCK&gt; and &lt;CONTROL&gt; keys. Mark 
Alexander offered this solution in the linux-laptop mailing list: On RedHat, 
it's a one-line patch to/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map , or whatever file is 
referenced in/etc/sysconfig/keyboard: </p>

<p></p> 
<h2>12.11.2. External (Second) Keyboard</h2> 
<p> A second (or external) keyboard can be attached using the PS/2 port (I 
suppose this is not possible via the serial port, since there is no keyboard 
controller for the serial port) or via USB port. Also there is one laptop with 
a detachable keyboard the Siemens Scenic Mobile 800. This machine uses an 
infrared connection to the keyboard, but I don't know whether this works with 
Linux.</p> 
<h3>12.11.2.1. External USB Keyboard Configuration</h3> 
<p> You may not need any operating system support at all to use a USB keyboard 
if you have a PC architecture. There are severalBIOS available where the BIOS 
can provideUSB support from a keyboard plugged into the root hub on the 
motherboard. This may or may not work through other hubs and does not normally 
work with add-in boards, so you might want to add in support anyway. You 
definitely want to add keyboard support if you activate operating system 
support, as the LinuxUSB support will disable the BIOS support. You also need 
to use LinuxUSB keyboard support if you want to use any of the 
&quot;multimedia&quot; types keys that are provided with someUSB keyboards. </p>
<p> In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on USB Human Interface 
Device (HID) support and Keyboard support. Do not turn onUSB HIDBP Keyboard 
support. Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are 
installing as modules, you need to load the hid.o, input.o and keybdev.o 
modules.</p> 
<p> Check the kernel logs to ensure that your keyboard is being correctly 
sensed by the kernel.</p> 
<p> At this point, you should be able to use your USB keyboard as a normal 
keyboard. Be aware that LILO is notUSB aware, and that unless your BIOS 
supports a legacyUSB keyboard, you may not be able to select a non-default boot 
image using theUSB keyboard. I have personally used a USB keyboard (and USB 
mouse) and experienced no problems.</p> 
<h3>12.11.2.2. External PS/2 Keyboard</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> Don't plug the external keyboard in while the laptop is booted, or plug 
the mouse in the keyboard port and the keyboard in the mouse port. On a 
Toshiba, this caused one user to have to completely shutdown the laptop, remove 
the keyboard/mouse, and do a cold reboot.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> For PS/2 ports there is a so called Y-Cable available, which makes it 
possible to use external mouse and external keyboard at the same time if your 
laptop supports this feature.</p> 
<p> Parport to AUX port adapter In some cases one kbd port and one aux port is 
not enough and you may want to add another keyboard or mouse. You can use this 
adapter, together with the<b>parkbd</b> module for that. </p> 
<p> On some laptops a splitter works to allow both mouse and keyboard to be 
plugged in; on others it doesn't work at all. If you want to use both, you 
better check that it works.</p>

<h2>12.12.2. Utilities</h2> 
<p> Some laptops offer extra buttons, e.g. - internet, mail keys, or zone 
keys. If the Linux kernel and XFree86/X.org generate key codes for them,<b>
hotkeys</b> or just plain <b>xmodmap</b> (see the man page of this X11 programm 
for details) may be helpful. If Linux doesn't know about the keys, you'll have 
to patch the kernel first. Though I'm not quite sure some tools don't seem to 
require this, I don't understand how it works yet. You may also usexhkeys . 
This tool allows you to assign an action to any key that is otherwise unused in 
X (such as the &quot;menu&quot; key on a 105 key keyboard, extra keys on some 
keyboard models, or odd keys on laptops). The action assigned to a key or key 
combination (key and modifiers) can be a builtin operation, a call to an 
external application, the sending of a key event (simulating a key 
press/release), or the sending of a mouse button event (simulating a button 
press/release).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> To get information about unknown keyboard or mouse events you may use <b>
showkey</b> and <b>mev</b> (the last one is from the <b>gpm</b> package) on a 
console screen. But some of the extra keys are not found with these tools.</p> 
<br> <br>

<p> keyTouch makes it possible to easily configure the extra function keys of 
a keyboard (like multimedia keys). It allows the user to define which program 
will be executed when a key is pressed. By using keyTouch-editor the user can 
easily create a keyboard file for his or her laptop to get the laptop supported.
</p> 
<p> <b>akdaemon</b> is a userland daemon to invoke &quot;the fun keys&quot; by 
accessing a dev node offered by the complementarykernel patch or the funkey 
programm . </p> 
<p> The hotkeys package is supposed to listen for those multimedia keys. </p> 
<p> Special (&quot;easy access&quot;) buttons are supported by LinEAK . Here 
is an examplelineakd.conf file: </p> 
<pre> # LinEAK Configuration file for Compaq Easy Access Key 2800 (6 keys) # 
Global settings KeyboardType = CIKP800 CdromDevice = /dev/cdrom MixerDevice = 
/dev/mixer # Specific keys of your keyboard internet = xosview search = kfind 
mail = kmail multimedia = &quot;artsdsp xmms&quot; voldown = &quot;aumix -v 
-2&quot; volup = &quot;aumix -v +2&quot; # end lineakd.conf</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> xbindkeys is a program that associates keys or mouse buttons to shell 
commands under X. After a little configuration, it can start many commands with 
the keyboard (e.g. control+alt+x starts an xterm) or with the mouse buttons.</p>
<p> ACME is a small GNOME tool to make use of the multimedia buttons present 
on most laptops and Internet keyboards: Volume, Brightness, Power, Eject, My 
Home, Search, E-Mail, Sleep, Screensaver, Finance, WWW, Calculator, Record, 
Close Window, Shade Window, Play, Stop, Pause, Previous, Next, Groups, Media, 
Refresh, and Help buttons. It works on all the platforms GNOME supports 
(laptops and PCs). It uses either OSS or ALSA for Volume control.</p> 
<p> For some laptop series there are Linux utilities available to control 
special hotkeys and other features.</p>

<h1>12.13. Function Key</h1> 
<p> The function key (often labelled Fn on the key) is usually used to switch 
on a simulated numeric keyboard, which is provided as a separate keypad on 
desktop keyboards. For those who don't want to use the simulation there are 
additional external numeric keypads available for PS/2 ports and I suppose USB 
ports. Also the function key may be used in combination with some F-keys to 
change display brightness, adjust the speaker volume or mute them, lock the 
keyboard, switch between external and internal display, use different suspend 
modes and more. Sometimes these key combinations work out of the box with 
Linux. Some require dedicated tools, for these tools see the Hotkey chapter 
above.</p> 
<h1>12.14. Power Key</h1> 
<p> The power key often has different functions, besides power on and off it 
may be used to wake up the machine from suspend mode. This is usually achieved 
by pressing the power button for just a few seconds only. If you press it 
longer (app. more than 5 seconds) it will power down fully.</p> 
<p> With modern laptops supporting ACPI it's also possible to achieve power 
off, with ACPI via the/proc/apci/ interface. </p> 
<h1>12.15. Extra LEDs</h1> 
<p> Some laptops offer extra LED, e.g. - mail - LEDs. I have found two 
programms, which might help to get them to work (but I couldn't test it):<b>
getmail</b>, <b>fujled</b>. Both are available from the The Led Project. The 
tool<b>setleds</b> might also be helpful (part of Linux Console Tools). </p> 
<h1>12.16. Numeric Keypad</h1> 
<p> On desktop keyboards the numeric keypad is usually separated from the 
character set, but laptops don't have a separated numeric keypad. There are 
different ways to emulate one, e.g. with the<b>Fn</b> key or with <b>NUM-LOCK
</b> key. Also external numeric keyboards which connect to the PS/2 port (or 
USB, RS232) are available.</p> 
<p> As described above, the numeric keyboard has to be used if you want to 
change the X11 resolution by typing<b>&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;+&gt;</b> or <b>
&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;-&gt;</b>. If this doesn't work or is too 
complicated, you may usegvidm Running <b>gvidm</b> will pop up a list of 
available modes and allows the user to select one if desired. This makes it 
perfect for running from an application menu or a hotkey, so you don't have to 
use ram for an applet constantly running. If you are running dual or multi-head 
displays, it will give you a list of screens so you can select the appropriate 
one. Also you may use<b>xvidtune [-next | -prev ]</b>. To check the current 
resolution you may use<b>xwininfo -root</b>, if <b>xvidtune</b> is not at hand.

<p></p> 
<h2>12.17.4. PS/2 Mice</h2> 
<p> Most of the mice used in laptops are PS/2 mice (actually I don't know one 
with another mouse protocol). You may communicate with the PS/2 mouse through
/dev/psaux or /dev/psmouse. If you use X Windows this device and the protocol 
has to be set in/etc/X11/XF86Config. In earlier releases, sometimes the GPM 
mouse manager and X Windows had trouble sharing a mouse when enabled at the 
same time. But as far as I know this is no problem anymore for the latest 
versions.</p> 
<p> Speaking of Emulate3Buttons, 100ms is usually better than the 50ms allowed

EndSection</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>12.17.5. Touchpad</h2> 
<p> Usually a touchpad works with the PS/2 mouse device /dev/psaux and the 
PS/2 protocol (for GPM and X11, for X11 it seems also worth to check the 
GlidePointPS/2 protocol).</p> 
<p> The Synaptics TouchPad driver has the following functions (some functions 
require features from the touchpad that must be present, multifinger taps for 
example):</p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed (Options: 
MinSpeed, MaxSpeed, AccelFactor)</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Button events through short touching of the touchpad (Options: MaxTapTime, 
MaxTapMove)</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the 
touchpad (Option: Edges)</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger on the 
right side of the touchpad (Options: Edges, VertScrollDelta)</p></li> 
<li>
<p> The up/down button sends button four/five events </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Adjustable finger detection (Option: Finger) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Ext Mouse repeater support - Alpha! (Option: Repeater) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right 
button events</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Online configuration through shared-memory (in development) (Option: 
SHMConfig)</p></li> </ol> 
<p> The <b>synclient</b> command is provived with the driver sources (note 
it's not included in SuSE Linux, at least not until 9.3). The command queries 
and modifies the Synaptics TouchPad driver parameters on the fly.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Tipping with one, two or three fingers on the touchpad simultaneously 
results in pressing the left, middle and respectively the right mouse-button.
</p> <br>
<br>

<p> There is also another touchpad driver available. The Synaptics Touchpad 
Linux Driver - <b>tpconfig</b> supports pointing devices used in notebooks by 
Acer, Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Olivetti, Texas Instruments, Winbook, and others.
</p> 
<p> Dell and Sony have started incorporating a touchpad, touchstick from ALPS. 
They are in at least the Dell Latitude CPx and the Sony VAIO laptop lines. 
Maintainer Bruce Kall writes: &quot;<b>tpconfig</b> does NOT support them at 
this time, but I am in the process of getting the API from ALPS and will be 
incorporating this in the next version of<b>tpconfig</b>. The Dell's also 
incorporate the ALPS GlideStick in the middle of the keyboard (like the stick 
pointer in some of the IBM Thinkpads). I also intend to support the disabling of
&quot;tapping&quot; the GlideStick as well. Tapping of the touchpad/touchsticks 
drives me crazy, I'm not sure about you (causes the&quot;selection&quot; of 
things on the screen when you don't want to)!&quot;</p> 
<p> <b>tpconfig</b> is a command-line utility to set options on Synaptics 
Touchpad and (now) ALPS Glidepad/ Stickpointers. Most people primarily use it 
to turn off the &quot;tap mode&quot; on laptop touchpads.</p> 
<p> How to use <b>tpconfig</b>: <b>tpconfig</b> is currently supported as a 
command-line configuration tool. The PS/2 port does not currently support 
sharing. Therefore the<b>tpconfig</b> utility will not work while any other 
mouse driver is loaded (e.g.<b>gpm</b>). This also means that you cannot use <b>
tpconfig</b> while X Windows is running. The suggested use of <b>tpconfig</b> 
is to run it from a startup script before gpm is started.</p> 
<p> IBM ThinkPad Scroll Daemon </p> 
<p> Not all touchpads are being from Synaptics, e.g some Gateways incorporate 
an EZ-Pad (Registered TM) and there might be other brands. TheTPREV.EXE utility 
will verify you have a Synaptics touchpad.</p> 
<p> The recent gpm package (version &gt;=1.8, maybe earlier versions contain 
touchpad support, too) includes the above mentioned Synaptics touchpad device 
driver. This device driver has been developed by H. Davies 
&lt;hdavies_AT_ameritech.net&gt;. Instead of using the PS/2 compatibility mode 
of touchpad devices, you can now use native touchpad mode with some pretty 
impressive features.</p> 
<p> In addition to translating finger motion into mouse motion and supporting 
the buttons, this support currently has several features (from the README):</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> a &quot;tap&quot; on the TouchPad causes a left mouse click </p></li> 
<li>
<p> a &quot;tap&quot; followed quickly by a finger motion causes a left button 
drag type action.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> a &quot;tap&quot; in one of the corners causes an action the default 
configuration is upper right causes middle mouse click and lower right causes 
right mouse click</p></li> 
<li>
<p> more pressure on the touch pad speeds the motion of the cursor </p></li> 
<li>
<p> a &quot;tap&quot; with a motion component (default &gt; 2mm) initiates a 
toss and catch sequence. This is terminated by a finger touch on the pad (the 
toss also ends after 1 sec since that is the idle timeout period for the 
touchpad).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> if the finger moves close to an edge then the mouse motion will be 
continued in that direction so that you don't need to pick up your finger and 
start moving again. This continued motion is pressure sensitive (more pressure 
is faster motion).</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> These features can be enabled/disabled and many of them have time and 
speed parameters which can be adjusted to the taste of the user.</p> 
<p> It seems <b>gpm</b> is best known as a console biased tool. This is true, 
but you may use it as an X11 input device.<b>gpm</b> is used as a repeater 
device. In this way you can use both the built-in synaptics touchpad with all 
the features and at the same time a serial mouse (with three buttons). This all 
works smoothly together. X11 reads the mouse events from a named pipe
/dev/gpmdata in a protocol it understands, which in my case is <em>
Mouse-Systems-Compatible</em> (5bytes). Most 3-button mice use the default 
protocol. So a simple reconfiguration in XF86Config is all that is required, 
after starting<b>gpm</b> in an appropriate way, of course. </p> 
<p> <b>gpm</b> could be started on your laptop with the following arguments : 
<b>/usr/bin/gpm -t synps2 -M -t ms -m /dev/ttyS0</b> . Both touchpad and serial 
mouse work in console and X11 mode. You do have to create the named pipe
/dev/gpmdata yourself. </p> 
<p> Tapping with two fingers simultaneously to simulate a middle mouse button 
works on Logitech touchpads used in a few machines.</p> 
<p> Thanks to Geert Van der Plas for most of the touchpad chapter. </p> 
<h2>12.17.6. Jog-Dial</h2> 
<p> The &quot;Jog-Dial&quot; is an input device used in the SONY VAIO laptop 
series. You may find aJog-Dial driver by Takaya Kinjo. Probably you have to 
change two things in thespicdriver/Makefile: </p> 
<p> <b>CCFLAG</b> has to be extended with <b>-D_LOOSE_KERNEL_NAMES</b> </p> 
<p> <b>CCFLAG</b> has to be extended with <b>
-I/usr/src/linux-&lt;kernel-version&gt;/include</b> </p> 
<p> The README seems to be in Japanese, here is an English version. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> $ tar xvzf jogutils.tar.gz $ cd jogutils $ make $ su # mknod /dev/spic c 
60 0 # modprobe spicdriver/spicdriver # exit $ cp jogapp/rcfile ~/.jogapprc $ 
jogapp/jogapp</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> ISHIKAWA Mutsumi wrote the jogdiald driver, which runs entirely in 
user-space (no kernel modules required). It is also available as anunofficial 
Debian package. </p> 
<p> rsjog. is a modification of the sjog utility. </p> 
<h2>12.17.7. Touchscreens</h2> 
<p> The only modern laptops I know which include a touchscreen are the Fujitsu 
Biblo 112/142 (aka MC 30) and the Palmax PD 1000/1100 (aka IPC 1000/1100).</p> 
<p> The latest version of the Linux Compaq Concerto Pen Driver is available 
from Joe Pfeiffer's home page.</p> 
<p> A current survey of drivers you may find at my page Touchscreen Laptops 
and Linux . </p> 
<h2>12.17.8. Pen Devices, Mousepoints</h2> 
<p> IBM and Toshiba laptops currently come with a pen devices instead of a 
mousepad or trackball.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> It needs some time to get used to this kind of pointer device. It may help 
to rest your palm at the front rest. Also it's recommended to reduce the mouse 
speed.</p> <br>
<br>

<h2>12.17.9. External Mouse</h2> 
<p> For better handling, e.g. with a 3 button mouse you may use an external 
mouse. This is usually a serial mouse or a PS/2 mouse, or in our days a USB 
mouse, appropriate to the port your laptop offers. Usually this is no problem. 
The only thing I currently don't know a solution for is the automagic detection 
of a newly plugged in mouse from X11. To get it work you have to restart your X 
server.</p> 
<h3>12.17.9.1. PS/2 Mouse</h3> 
<p> For PS/2 ports there are so called Y-Cable available, which make it 
possible to use external mouse and external keyboard at the same time if your 
laptop supports this feature.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Don't plug in the external mouse while powered up. If you have separate 
mouse and keyboard ports, make sure you plug the mouse in the mouse port and 
the keyboard in the keyboard port. If you don't, you may have to do a hard 
reboot of the laptop to get it to recover.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>12.17.9.2. Wheel Mouse</h3> 
<p> Imwheel makes the wheel of your Intellimouse (and other wheel and stick 
mice) work in Linux/X11 to scroll windows up and down, or send keys to 
programs. It runs in the background as a daemon and requires little 
reconfiguration of the XWindows setup. 4 or more button mice and Alps Glidepad 
'Taps' may also be used.<b>imwheel</b> includes a modified <b>gpm</b> for an 
alternate method of wheel input.</p> 
<p> See also the WHEEL Mouse FAQ which describes how to get lots of X 
applications to recognise the scrolling action. For current instructions on 
XFree86 4.x seeXFree86 4.x - Mouse Docs. </p> 
<h3>12.17.9.3. USB Mouse</h3> 
<p> This part is taken from The Linux USB Sub-System by Brad Hards. </p> 
<h4>12.17.9.3.1. USB Human Interface Device (HID) Configuration</h4> 
<h5>12.17.9.3.1.1. General HID Configuration</h5> 
<p> There are two options for using a USB mouse or a USB keyboard - the 
standalone Boot Protocol way and the full featured HID driver way. The Boot 
Protocol way is generally inferior, and this document describes the full 
featured way. The Boot Protocol way may be appropriate for embedded systems and 
other systems with resource constraints and no real need for the full keyboard 
and mouse capabilities.</p> 
<p> It is important to remember that the HID driver handles those devices (or 
actually those interfaces on each device) that claim to comply with the Human 
Interface Device (HID) specification. However the HID specification doesn't say 
anything about what the HID driver should do with information received from a 
HID device, or where the information that is sent to a device comes from, since 
this is obviously dependent on what the device is supposed to be doing, and 
what the operating system is. Linux (at the operating system kernel level) 
supports four interfaces to a HID device - keyboard, mouse, joystick and a 
generic interface, known as the event interface.</p> 
<h5>12.17.9.3.1.2. HID Mouse Configuration</h5> 
<p> In the kernel configuration stage, you need to turn on USB Human Interface 
Device (HID) support and Mouse Support Do not turn onUSB HIDBP Mouse support. 
Perform the normal kernel rebuild and installation steps. If you are installing 
as modules, you need to load theinput.o, hid.o and mousedev.o modules. </p> 
<p> Plug in a USB mouse and check that your mouse has been correctly sensed by 
the kernel. If you don't have a kernel message, look for the changes to
/proc/bus/usb/devices. </p> 
<p> Since USB supports multiple identical devices, you can have multiple mice 
plugged in. You can get each mouse seperately, or you can get them all mixed 
together. You almost always want the mixed version, and that is what will be 
used together. You need to set up a device node entry for the mixed mice. It is 
customary to create the entries for this device in the /dev/input/ directory.
</p> 
<p> Use the following commands: </p> 
<pre> mkdir /dev/input mknod /dev/input/mice c 13 63 </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> If you are unsure whether you are configuring the right mouse device, use 
<b>cat /dev/input/mice</b> (or other appropriate devices names). In case you do 
this for the correct mouse, you should see some bizarre looking characters as 
you move the mouse or click any of the buttons.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> If you want to use the mouse under X, you have various options. Which one 
you select is dependent on what version of XFree86 you are using and whether 
you are using onlyUSB for your mouse (or mice), or whether you want to use a USB
 mouse and some other kind of pointer device.</p> 
<p> You need to edit the XF86Config file (usually /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config
 or/etc/X11/XF86Config). </p> 
<p> If you are using XFree86 version 4.0 or later, add an InputDevice section 
that looks like the following:</p> 
<pre> Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier &quot;USB Mice&quot; Driver 
&quot;mouse&quot; Option &quot;Protocol&quot; &quot;IMPS/2&quot; Option 
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/input/mice&quot; EndSection</pre> <br>
<br>
 or, 
if you want to use a wheel mouse, something like this may be more useful: 
<pre> Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier &quot;USB Mice&quot; Driver 
&quot;mouse&quot; Option &quot;Protocol&quot; &quot;IMPS/2&quot; Option 
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/input/mice&quot; Option &quot;ZAxisMapping&quot; 
&quot;4 5&quot; Option &quot;Buttons&quot; &quot;5&quot; EndSection</pre> <br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p> Consult the current XFree86 documentation for a detailed explaination and 
more examples.</p> 
<p> You also need to add an entry to each applicable ServerLayout Section. 
These are normally at the end of the configuration file. If you only have aUSB 
mouse (orUSB mice), then replace the line with the &quot;CorePointer&quot; 
entry with the following line:</p> 
<pre> InputDevice &quot;USB Mice&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot; </pre> <br>
<br>
<p></p> 
<p> If you want to use both a USB mouse (or USB mice) and some other kind of 
pointer device, then add (do not replace) the following line to the applicable 
ServerLayout sections:</p> 
<pre> InputDevice &quot;USB Mice&quot; &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; </pre> <br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p> If you are using only a USB mouse (or USB mice) with XFree86 3.3, edit the 
Pointer section so that it looks like the following:</p> 
<pre> Section &quot;Pointer&quot; Protocol &quot;IMPS/2&quot; Device 
&quot;/dev/input/mice&quot; EndSection</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> If you are trying to use a USB mouse (or USB mice) in addition to another 
pointer type device with XFree86 3.3, then you need to use the XInput 
extensions. Keep the existing Pointer (or modify it as required for the other 
device if you are doing an initial installation), and add the following entry 
(anywhere sensible, ideally in the Input devices area):</p>

<p> Restart the X server. If you don't have any mouse support at this point, 
remember that Ctrl-Alt-F1 will get you a virtual terminal that you can use to 
kill the X server and start debugging from the error messages.</p> 
<p> If you want to use the mouse under gpm, run (or kill and restart if it is 
already running) gpm with the following options.<b>gpm -m /dev/input/mice -t

advance. You can use this as the mouse &quot;device&quot; to non-X programs, 
and both mice will work together.</p>

<h3>12.17.9.4. Wrist Input Device - Twiddler</h3> 
<p> The <b>gpm</b> contains a driver for the Twiddler device at the serial 
port. For information about the Twiddler seeHandykey Corporation . </p> 
<h2>12.17.10. Macintosh PowerBooks</h2> 
<p> PowerBooks have a trackpad and only one button, although you can plug in 
external multi-buttonUSB mice. The usual thing is to map a couple of keys on 
the keyboard to the middle and right mouse buttons; your Linux distribution 
should come with instructions on how to configure this (it's not specific to 
laptops, as all Apple mice are single-button).</p> 
<p> If you are using the <b>Xpmac</b> server, the default is option-1 and 
option-2, and you can change this by passing<b>-middlekey &lt;keycode&gt;</b> 
<b>-rightkey &lt;keycode&gt;</b> arguments to <b>Xpmac</b>, and <b>
-nooptionmouse</b> if you don't want the option key to be needed. </p> 
<p> If you are using XFree86, you pass <b>adb_buttons=&lt;middlekey&gt;</b>,<b>
&lt;rightkey&gt;</b> kernel arguments (no option is required). I use <b>
adb_buttons=58,55</b> to map the option and Apple/command keys (which are 
little-used in Linux); use e.g.<b>xev</b> to find out the keycode for a given 
key.</p> 
<h1>12.18. Advanced Power Management - APM</h1> 
<h2>12.18.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> Start by reading the Battery-Powered-mini-HOWTO. </p> 
<p> For APM to work the machine's firmware must implement the APM Specification
. Linux supports versions 1.0 through 1.2 of the standard. To work with Linux 
theAPM BIOS must support 32-bit protected mode connections. </p> 
<p> To display information about the APM BIOS on your system you can run <b>
dmesg | grep apm</b> command or look in the /proc/apm file. </p> 
<h2>12.18.2. Introduction</h2> 
<p> APM support consists of two parts: <em>kernel</em> support and <em>
user-land</em> support. </p> 
<h3>12.18.2.1. Kernel Support</h3> 
<p> You need a kernel that has the APM driver compiled in using the 
appropriate kernel configuration options. Currently most distributions do not 
ship kernels with theAPM driver enabled so you may have to enable the driver 
using a boot option or to compile a custom kernel. Please seeKernel-HOWTO or 
your distribution manual for details.</p> 
<p> The APM driver can be modularized but this is not recommended since many 
drivers will disable theirAPM features if the APM driver is not present when 
they initialize themselves.</p> 
<p> The available APM options are (please see Documentation/Configure.help in 
the kernel source tree for more details):</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND</b> Just a workaround for some NEC Versa 
M series laptops.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE</b> Enable APM features at boot time. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE</b> Puts CPU in power save mode, if there is 
nothing to do for the kernel.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK</b> Some laptops can use this to turn off the 
LCD backlight when the screen blanker of the Linux virtual console blanks the 
screen. Note that this is only used by the virtual console screen blanker, and 
won't turn off the backlight when using the X Window system.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF</b> Turns the machine completely down, when using 
<b>halt</b>. This feature works with most laptops without problems. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND</b> Just a workaround for IBM&trade; 
ThinkPad 560.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE</b> Just a workaround for Dell 
Inspiron 3200 and other notebooks.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT</b> Stores time in Greenwich Mean Time format. It 
is in fact recommended to store GMT in your real time clock (RTC) in the BIOS.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS</b> Resolves some problems with <em>Suspend to 
Disk</em> for some laptops, for instance many newer IBM&trade; ThinkPads. </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> <b>CONFIG_SMP</b> Symmetric Multi-Processing support. This enables support 
for systems with more than one CPU. If you have a system with only one CPU, 
like most personal computers, say N. Though the default seems to be Y. So it 
may be enabled if you are unaware. I have got reports that SMP support enabled 
does interfere with APM. So with a single CPU machine like a laptop you are on 
the save side, when you N.</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Features of the APM driver according to the Kernel documentation file 
Documentation/Configure.help: &quot;The system time will be reset after a USER 
RESUME operation, the/proc/apm device will provide battery status information, 
and user-space programs will receive notification ofAPM <em>events</em> (e.g., 
battery status change). &quot;</p> 
<h3>12.18.2.2. Userland Support</h3> 
<p> The most important <em>userland</em> utility is apmd, a daemon that handles
APM events. </p> 
<p> If you run a 2.2.x or later kernel and want to experiment, Gabor Kuti 
&lt;seasons_AT_falcon.sch.bme.hu&gt; has made a kernel patch that allows you to
<em>hibernate</em> any Linux system to disk, even if your computers APM BIOS 
doesn't support it directly. In my humble opinion you don't need this features 
if your laptop provides a function key to invoke suspend mode directly.</p> 
<p> Please see the Battery Powered Linux Mini-HOWTO for detailed information. 
</p> 
<p> Here's what <b>apmd</b> can do: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> apmd(8): logs the battery status to syslog every now and then and runs a 
proxy script that can take action before suspend or after resume</p></li> 
<li>
<p> apm(1): prints the current battery status or suspends the computer </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> apmsleep(1): suspends the machine for a limited time </p></li> 
<li>
<p> xapm(1x): provides a battery meter for X11 </p></li> 
<li>
<p> libapm.a: a library for writing APM applications </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Some APM firmware fails to restore mixer settings properly which can 
result in squeals of feedback in the music after the machine has resumed. A 
solution is to set up the proxy script so that it calls a mixer application 
after resume.</p> 
<p> From the apmsleep(1) man page: Some computers, especially laptops, can 
wake up from a low-power suspend to DRAM mode using the Real-time clock (RTC) 
chip. Apmsleep can be used to set the alarm time in the RTC and to go into 
suspend or standby mode. An interrupt from the RTC causes the computer to 
wake-up. The program detects this event, by waiting for a leap in the kernel 
time and terminates successfully. If no time leap occurs within one minute, or 
something goes wrong, the exit value will be non-zero. Apmsleep is part of the
<b>apmd</b> package. </p> 
<p> In 2001 Richard Gooch wrote a simple <b>apmd</b> alternative which is 
available in thepmutils package. </p> 
<p> Also, take a look at <b>apmcd</b> (<b>apm</b> based crontab) at 
ftp://ftp.binary9.net/pub/linux/ . This tool was written by Nicolas J. Leon 
&lt;nicholas_AT_binary9.net&gt;.</p> 
<h2>12.18.3. Caveats</h2> 
<p> If you use another operating system at the same computer make sure that 
its &quot;suspend&quot; and &quot;hibernate&quot; features don't write to 
partitions that are used by Linux.</p> 
<h2>12.18.4. Troubleshooting</h2> 
<p> If your machine worked with 2.0.x kernels but not with the 2.2.x series, 
take this advice from Klaus Franken kfr_AT_klaus.franken.de : &quot;The default 
changed in 2.2. Search in the init-scripts for<b>halt</b> and change it to <b>
halt -p</b> or <b>poweroff</b>. See <b>man halt</b> , if you don't have this 
option you need a newer version of<b>halt</b>.&quot; You may find it in the <b>
SysVinit</b> package. </p> 
<p> On some new machines (for instance HP Omnibook 4150 - 366 MHz model) when 
accessing/proc/apm, you may get a kernel fault <b>general protection fault: f000
</b>. Stephen Rothwell explaines: &quot;This is your APM BIOS attempting to use 
a real mode segment while in protected mode, i.e. it is a bug in your BIOS. .. 
We have seen a few of these recently, except all the others are in the power 
off code in theBIOS where we can work around it by returning to real mode 
before attempting to power off. Here we cannot do this.&quot;</p> 
<p> According to Kernel docs Documentation/Configure.help: &quot;Some other 
things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,<em>weird</em> 
problems:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is enabled <b>swapon 
-s</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> pass the <b>no-hlt</b> option to the kernel. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass the <b>no387</b> 
option to the kernel.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> pass the <b>floppy=nodma</b> option to the kernel. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> pass the <b>mem=4M</b> option to the kernel (thereby disabling all but the 
first 4 MB of RAM).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> make sure that the CPU is not over clocked (doesn't seem suitable for 
mobile machines).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> read the sig11 FAQ . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> disable the cache from your BIOS settings. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM (doesn't seem 
suitable for mobile machines).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> install a better fan for the CPU (doesn't seem suitable for mobile 
machines).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> exchange RAM chips (doesn't seem suitable for mobile machines). </p></li> 
<li>
<p> exchange the motherboard (doesn't seem suitable for mobile machines). </p>
</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>12.18.5. APM and PCMCIA</h2> 
<p> From the PCMCIA-HOWTO: &quot;Card Services can be compiled with support for
APM (Advanced Power Management) if you've configured your kernel with APM 
support. ... ThePCMCIA modules will automatically be configured for APM if a 
compatible version is detected on your system. Whether or notAPM is configured, 
you can use<b>cardctl suspend</b> before suspending your laptop, and <b>cardctl 
resume</b> after resuming, to cleanly shut down and restart your PCMCIA cards. 
This will not work with a modem that is in use, because the serial driver isn't 
able to save and restore the modem operating parameters.APM seems to be 
unstable on some systems. If you experience trouble withAPM and PCMCIA on your 
system, try to narrow down the problem to one package or the other before 
reporting a bug. Some drivers, notably thePCMCIA SCSI drivers, cannot recover 
from a suspend/resume cycle. When using aPCMCIA SCSI card, always use <b>
cardctl eject</b> prior to suspending the system.&quot;. </p> 
<h2>12.18.6. APM and Resuming X Windows</h2> 
<p> Some machines have APM firmware that fails to save and restore display 
controller chip registers across a suspend. Earlier versions of the XFree86 X 
server did not restore the screen properly after resume, a problem which was 
addressed byLinux Laptops. However, contemporary versions of XFree86 mostly do 
the right thing.</p> 
<p> Sometimes X and APM don't work smoothly together. The machine might even 
hang. A recommendation from Steve Rader: Some linux systems have their X11 
server hang when doing<b>apm -s</b>. Folks with this affliction might want to 
switch to the console virtual terminal and then suspend<b>chvt 1; apm -s</b> as 
root, or, more appropiately<b>sudo chvt 1; sudo apm -s</b>. I have these 
commands in a script, say,<b>my-suspend</b> and then do <b>xapmload 
--click-command my-suspend</b> . </p> 
<h2>12.18.7. Software Suspend</h2> 
<p> Software suspend enables the possibility of suspending a machine. It 
doesn't need APM. You may suspend your machine by either pressing Sysrq-d or 
with<b>swsusp</b> or <b>shutdown -z</b> (patch for <b>sysvinit</b> needed). It 
creates an image which is saved in your active swaps. By the next booting the 
kernel detects the saved image, restores the memory from it and then it 
continues to run as before you've suspended. If you don't want the previous 
state to continue use the<b>noresume</b> kernel option. </p> 
<p> Software suspends may even be better than hibernate, because now I can 
suspend my Linux system, boot into Microsoft Windows, perform a few illegal 
operations and be shut down, and then restart my Linux setup exactly where I 
left off! This is something that cannot be done with hibernation, since that 
always restores the last state that you suspended from, be it Microsoft Windows 
or Linux. So if I want to switch to Microsoft Windows to play games or do 
anything else, I can leave my Linux desktop exactly as it is and return to how 
I left it.</p> 
<p> In recent 2.6 kernels SoftWareSuspend is part of the kernel. You may find 
it in the section Power Management. But there are also backports to 2.4 
available.</p> 
<p> Since the original Software Suspend code was written by Gabor Kuti and 
Pavel Machek back in 1998, three different implementations have been created 
for the 2.6 kernel, all forks of the same original codebase. Here is aquick 
comparison between the two that still exist. </p> 
<p> Software Suspend 2 has a long feature list, including the ability to 
cancel a suspend by pressing Escape, image compression to save time and space, 
a versatile plugin architecture, and support for machines with Highmem, 
preemption and SMP.</p>

<h2>12.19.2. ACPI Details</h2> 
<p> ACPI stands for <em>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</em>. This 
is a specification by Toshiba, Intel and Microsoft. Besides many other things 
it also defines power management. This is why it is often compared to APM.</p> 
<p> You might use the following parameters (with the appropriate changes) in 
your boot loader configuration file (e.g./etc/lilo.conf to experiment with ACPI 
and APM, when compiled in the same kernel. Usage of APM andACPI at the same

<p> The Linux ACPI Project is committed to the development of fundamental ACPI 
(Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) components for Linux. This 
includes a generic ACPI table parser, AML interpreter, bus and device drivers, 
policy, user interface, and support tools.</p> 
<p> The E-AcpiPower epplet is based on E-Power. It is modified to read battery 
status information using the new acpi kernel module, making it much more 
accurate and reliable than the old APM method.</p> 
<p> TCL/TK script which allows setting the ACPI CPU performance state using a 
graphical interface under Linux.</p> 
<p> acpi.py provides an uniform and platform-independent interface to ACPI. 
</p> 
<p> Linux ACPI client is a command-line tool, similar to the <b>apm</b> 
command, that provides information on battery status, AC power, and thermal 
readings.</p> 
<h1>12.20. Power Management Unit - PMU (PowerBook)</h1> 
<p> PowerBooks don't support the APM specification, but they have a separate 
protocol for their PMU (Power Management Unit). There is a free (GPL) daemon 
called<b>pmud</b> that handles power management; it can monitor the battery 
level, put the machine to sleep, and set different levels of power consumption. 
It was written by Stephan Leemburg. There is also an older utility called<b>
snooze</b> available from the same sites that just puts the PowerBook to sleep. 
PBButtons now includes the functionality of <b>pmud</b>. </p> 
<p> Cron works fine on my laptop as I never shut it off completely. I only put 
it to sleep. When it wakes up, the unexecuted<b>cron</b> jobs from the sleep 
period all run.</p>

<p> Stephen Rothwell proposed a patch that will add multiple battery support 
to the kernel APM.</p> 
<p> From the <b>mobile-update</b> page (modified by WH): Discharge the 
battery. If your battery runs only for about 20 minutes, you probably suffer 
from memory effects. Most laptops do not discharge the battery properly. With 
low powered devices like old computer fans they can be discharged completely. 
This removes memory effects. You should do so even with LiIon batteries, though 
they don't suffer much from memory effect (the manual of anIBM&trade; Thinkpad 
says to cycle the batteries through a full charge/discharge cycle 3 times every 
few months or so).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Try this at your own risk! Make sure the voltage of the fans is compatible 
to your battery. It works for me.</p> <br>

<h1>12.22. Memory</h1> 
<p> Unfortunately some laptops come with proprietary memory chips. So they are 
not interchangeable between different models. But this seems changing. With 
some models it's very difficult to install the memory if you have to open the

changed easily are dedicated maintenance cover on the backside or often if you 
only have to remove the keyboard.</p> 
<h1>12.23. Plug-and-Play Devices (PnP)</h1> 
<p> The <em>Plug and Play driver project</em> for Linux is a project to create 
support within the Linux kernel (seeLinux.Org for more information) for 
handling Plug and Play (and other semi-PnP) devices in a clean, consistent way. 
It aims to allow a driver of any type of hardware to have this hardware 
configured by the PnP driver in the kernel. This driver is then notified when 
the device is reconfigured, or even removed from the system, so as to allow for 
graceful action in these circumstances.</p> 
<p> <em>ISA PnP tools</em> is another useful package. </p> 
<p> And there is a project at RedHat . </p> 
<p> The latest PCMCIA driver package (&gt;3.1.0) has utilities <b>lspnp</b> and
<b>setpnp</b> to manipulate PNP settings. </p> 
<h1>12.24. Docking Station / Port Replicator</h1> 
<h2>12.24.1. Definitions</h2> 
<p> First some definitions. There is a difference between <em>docking station
</em> and <em>port replicator</em>. </p> 
<p> I use the term <em>docking station</em> for a box which contains slots to 
put some interface cards in, and space to put a harddisk, etc. in. This box can 
be permanently connected to a PC. A<em>port replicator</em> is just a copy of 
the laptop ports which may be connected permanently to a PC.</p> 
<h2>12.24.2. Other Solutions</h2> 
<p> I don't use a docking station myself. They seem really expensive and I 
can't see any usefulness. Alright you have to deal with some more cables, but 
is it worth so much money? Docking stations are useful in an office environment 
when you have a permanent network connection, or need the docking station's 
expansion bus slots (e.g. for some excotic SCSI device).</p> 
<p> Also all docking stations I know are proprietary models, so if you change 
your laptop you have to change this device, too. I just found one exception a 
docking station which connects to your laptop viaIrDA&reg; the IRDocking IR-660 
byTekram . It supports these connectors: 10Base-T (RJ-45); PS/2 Keyboard; PS/2 
Mouse; 25-Pin Printer Port (LPT); IR Transceiver; Power (6 VDC). So it seems 
that a VGA port and a port to connect a desktop PC directly are missing. This 
device should work with Linux/IrDA&reg;, though I couldn't check it out. </p> 
<p> I would prefer to buy a PC instead and connect it via <em>network</em> to 
the laptop.</p> 
<p> Or use an external display, which usually works well as described above, 
and an external keyboard and mouse. If your laptop supports an extra PS/2 port 
you may use a cheap solution a<em>Y-cable</em>, which connects the PS/2 port to 
an external keyboard and an external monitor. Note: Your laptop probably has 
support for the<em>Y-cable</em> feature, e.g. the COMPAQ Armada 1592DT. </p> 
<h2>12.24.3. Docking Station Connection Methods</h2> 
<p> AFAIK there are <em>four solutions</em> to connect a laptop to a docking 
station:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> SCSI port (very seldom) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> parallel port </p></li> 
<li>
<p> (proprietary) docking port (common) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> USB (often offered by third party manufacturers) </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> From Martin J. Evans &quot;The main problem with docking stations is 
getting the operating system to detect you are docked. Fortunately, you can 
examine the devices available in/proc and thus detect a docked state. With this 
in mind a few simple scripts is all you need to get your machine configured 
correctly in a docked state.</p> 
<p> You may want to build support for the docking station hardware as modules 
instead of putting it directly into the kernel. This will save space in your 
kernel but your choice probably largely depends on how often you are docked.</p>
<p> 1) Supporting <em>additional disks</em> on the docking station SCSI card 
</p> 
<p> To my mind the best way of doing this is to: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Either build support for the SCSI card into the kernel or build it as a 
module.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Put the mount points into /etc/fstab but use the &quot;noauto&quot; flag 
to prevent them from being mounted automatically with the<b>mount -a</b> flag. 
In this way, when you are docked you can explicitly mount the partitions off 
any disk connected to the docking station SCSI card.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> 2) Supporting <em>additional network adaptors</em> in the docking station 
</p> 
<p> You can use a similar method to that outlined above for the graphics card. 
Check the/proc filesystem in your rc scripts to see if you are docked and then 
set up your network connections appropriately. &quot;</p> 
<p> Once you determine this information, you may use a script, similar to the 
following example, to configure the connection to your docking station at 
startup. The script is provided by Friedhelm Kueck:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> # check, if Laptop is in docking-station (4 PCMCIA slots available) # or 
if it is standalone (2 slots available) # Start after cardmgr has started # # 
Friedhelm Kueck mailto:fk_AT_impress.de # 08-Sep-1998 # # Find No. of Sockets

<h2>12.24.4. Universal USB Port Replicators</h2> 
<p> I have used a Typhoon USB 2.0 7in1 Docking Station made by Anubis P/N 
83057 to check the Linux compatibility of such devices. Actually this device 
should be named port replicator, because it does not have any extension slots. 
This device doesn't have a VGA port to connect to an external display. Only a 
few USB docking stations have this feature. It would be nice to get a report 
whether a VGA port works or not. Tested with laptop COMPAQ M700 (USB 1.1) and 
custom made kernel 2.6.1. Note the port replicator didn't work with an Apple 
PowerBook G4.</p> 
<p> How does its different ports work with Linux: </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> USB 2.0 A-type downstream: works with external hard disk and mouse out of 
the box</p></li> 
<li>
<p> USB 2.0 A-type downstream: see above </p></li> 
<li>
<p> PS/2 keyboard: works out of the box </p></li> 
<li>
<p> PS/2 mouse: works, but for 2.6 Kernels you have to specifiy the right 
mouse protocol<b>psmouse_proto=imps</b> (if psmouse is compiled as a module). 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> serial port: tested with serial mouse, doesn't seem to work, <b>

<li>
<p> LAN: usbnet loads, device eth1 was assigned, <b>ifconfig</b> or <b>pump</b>
 configures the network device</p></li> 
<li>
<p> transfer port aka host link: works with usbnet module, use <b>ifconfig usb0
</b> to configure the network interface, (USB 1.1 host link B-type) untested

<h2>12.25.2. Connection Methods</h2> 
<p> Almost all recent laptops are equipped with a built-in network card. This 
chapter shows some methods to connect older laptops without internal network 
cards.</p> 
<h3>12.25.2.1. PCMCIA Network Card</h3> 
<p> If your laptop supports PCMCIA this is the easiest and fastest way to get 
network support. Make sure your card is supported before buying one.</p> 
<h3>12.25.2.2. Serial Null Modem Cable</h3> 
<p> Probably the cheapest way to connect your laptop to another computer, but 
quite slow. You may use PPP or SLIP to start the connection.</p> 
<h3>12.25.2.3. Parallel Port NIC (Pocket Adaptor)</h3> 
<p> Accton Pocket Ethernet and Linux This ethernet adaptor uses a parallel 
port and delivers approximately 110k Bytes/s throughput for those notebooks 
that do not havePCMCIA slots. </p> 
<h3>12.25.2.4. Parallel &quot;Null&quot; Modem Cable</h3> 
<p> Offers more speed than a serial connection. Some laptops use chipsets that 
will not work with PLIP. Please seePLIP-HOWTO for details. </p> 
<h3>12.25.2.5. Docking Station NIC</h3> 
<p> I don't have experience with a NIC in a docking station yet. </p> 
<h2>12.25.3. Wake-On-LAN</h2> 
<p> Wake-On-LAN works with some laptops equipped with built-in network cards. 
Wake-On-LAN is the generic name for the AMD &quot;Magic Packet&quot; 
technology. It's very similar to the PCMCIA modem &quot;wake on ring&quot; 
signal line. The basic idea is that the network adapter has a very-low-power 
mode to monitor the network for special packet data that will wake up the 
machine. Theetherwake package as well as the Wakeonlan Perl script are able to 
send 'magic packets' to wake-on-LAN enabled ethernet adapters and motherboards, 
in order to switch on remote computers.</p> 
<h1>12.26. Built-In Modem</h1> 
<h2>12.26.1. Modem Types</h2> 
<p> There are three kinds of modems available: internal, PCMCIA card or 
external serial port modems. But some internal modems will not work with Linux 
these modems are usually called WinModem. This is caused by non-standard 
hardware. So you have to use either aPCMCIA card modem or an external modem 
(serial or USB). TheLinModem-HOWTO by Sean Walbran provides a detailed 
instruction how to deal with these kind of modems. My pages aboutInternal 
Modems in Laptops and miniPCI Devices in Laptops provide a survey about the 
modem controllers used in different laptops.</p> 
<p> Quotation from the Kernel-FAQ: &quot;9.Why aren't WinModems supported? 
(REG, quoting Edward S. Marshall) The problem is the lack of specifications for 
this hardware. Most companies producing so-called<em>WinModems</em> refuse to 
provide specifications which would allow non-Microsoft operating systems to use 
them. The basic issue is that they don't work like a traditional modem; they 
don't have a DSP, and make the CPU do all the work. Hence, you can't talk to 
them like a traditional modem, and you -need- to run the modem driver as a 
realtime task, or you'll have serious data loss issues under any kind of load. 
They're simply a poor design.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;<em>Win</em> modems are lobotomized modems which expect Windows to 
do some of their thinking for them. If you do not have Windows, you do not have 
a connection. &quot;</p> 
<p> Anyway, I have set up a page collecting information on laptops with 
internal modems atTuxMobil - Hardware . Maybe it's possible to run such modems 
with MS-Windows9x/NT emulators like<b>wine</b> or <b>VMware</b>, but I don't 
know it.</p> 
<p> The Linux WinModem Support and the Gromit Winmodem page are more or less 
the standard as to whether a modem is real or not, and also contain directions 
to getting drivers for the few winmodems that do have Linux drivers.</p> 
<p> There is a driver for Lucent WinModems (alpha) available at SuSE - Labs and
LTModem diagnostic tool . LucentPCI (binary only) driver, for PCI driven 
internal modems, seeLinux WinModem Support . </p> 
<h2>12.26.2. Caveats</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p> Pay attention to the different kinds of phone lines: analog and ISDN. You 
can't connect an analog modem to an ISDN port and vice versa. Though there 
might be hybrid modems available. Connecting to the wrong port may even destroy 
your modem. Trick: If you are looking for an analog phone port in an office 
building which is usually wired with ISDN, take a look at the fax lines, they 
are often analog lines.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> If your machine features an internal modem as well as an internal ethernet 
card, pay also attention to plug the right cable into the plug. Otherwise you 
may damage your hardware easily. It may even cause a fire.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> For tracking the packets on PPP you may use <b>pppstats</b>. Or <b>pload
</b> this provides a graphical view of the traffic (in and out) of the PPP 
connection. It is based on athena widgets hence is very portable. It also uses 
very little CPU time. The home of<b>pload</b> is here . </p> 
<h1>12.27. GPRS</h1> 
<p> GPRS is a General Packet Radio Service, an add-on to GSM and TDMA cellular 
telephone standards used all over the world. It allows (almost) always-on 
Internet connections using GSM (or TDMA) telephones. It makes mobile internet 
usage on laptops fairly inexpensive. TheGPRS-HOWTO is written by Esa Turtianen 
etu_AT_dna.fi and Jari Arkko Jari_AT_arkko.com</p> 
<h1>12.28. SCSI</h1> 
<h2>12.28.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> If unsure about the right SCSI support, compile a kernel with all 
available SCSI drivers as modules. Load each module step by step until you get 
the right one.</p> 
<h2>12.28.2. Related Documentation</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> SCSI-2.4-HOWTO </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>12.28.3. Survey</h2> 
<p> There is no current x86 laptop yet with a SCSI harddisk. Though there have 
been two models with a built in SCSI port: Texas Instruments TI 4000 and HP 
OmniBook 800. Maybe the PowerBook G3 has a SCSI disk, but I didn't check this 
yet. The old Apple Powerbook Duo models had a SCSI hard disk.</p> 
<p> For other models, if you need SCSI support you may get it by using a SCSI-
PCMCIA card or via a SCSI adapter in a docking station. </p> 
<h1>12.29. Universal Serial Bus - USB</h1> 
<h2>12.29.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> You should get information about the USB controller with <b>cat /proc/pci
</b> and about USB devices with <b>cat /proc/bus/usb/devices</b>. </p> 
<h2>12.29.2. Miscellaneous</h2> 
<p> Newer laptops come equipped with the Universal Serial Bus - USB. The 
followingUSB devices are available, not all of them are fully supported by 
Linux yet: keyboard, mouse, printer, tablet, camera, cpia, webcam, MP3 player, 
modem, wireless LAN, audio, jukebox, scanner, storage (hard drive, memory 
stick), floppydrive, ZIP, Super Disk - LS 120, compact flash reader, CD, 
BlueTooth, ethernet, serial, joystick, USB Host-to-Host Cable, hub .</p> 
<p> Visit the USB Linux home page. Also I have set up a page collecting 
information about laptops and mobile devices usingUSB at the TuxMobil - Mobile 
Hardware Survey . </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Please note, I have got a report that the power by a laptop via USB is not 
enough for some kind of devices, e.g. Web Cams or hard disks. But it seems to 
depend on the laptop and the specific device. With desktop Linux machines these 
USB devices work flawlessly, but with mobile devices not.</p> <br>
<br>

<h1>12.30. FireWire - IEEE1394 - i.Link</h1> 
<p> Firewire, also known as IEEE-1394 and iLink, is a high-speed serial bus 
system that was originally developed by Apple Computer. Currently, its widest 
implementation is for digital video; however, it has a lot of other uses. Like 
USB, Firewire is a serial protocol that supports hot-swapping. Firewire 
supports much higher speeds than USB. TheLinux IEEE 1394 Subsystem provides 
support for IEEE 1394 (FireWire, i.Link). It consists of a kernel subsystem as 
well as applications.</p> 
<p> Also I have set up a page collecting information about laptops and 
FireWire atTuxMobil - Mobile Hardware Survey . </p> 
<h1>12.31. Floppy Drive</h1> 
<h2>12.31.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> Usually there are no problems connecting a floppy drive to a Linux laptop. 
But with a laptop floppy drive you may sometimes not be able to use every 
feature. I encountered the<b>superformat</b> command (from the fdutils package) 
couldn't format more than 1.44MB with my HP OmniBook 800. You may also have 
difficulty when the floppy drive and CD drive are mutually exclusive, or when 
the floppy drive is aPCMCIA device (as with the Toshiba Libretto 100). With 
older laptops, there might be a minor problem if they use a 720K drive. As far 
as I know all distributions come with support for 1.44M (and sometimes 1.2M) 
floppies only. Though it's possible to install Linux anyway. Please see 
Installation chapter. Please see kernel documentation for boot time parameters 
concerning certain laptop floppy drives, for instanceIBM&trade; ThinkPad. Or <b>
man bootparam</b> . </p>

<li>
<p> CD-Writing-HOWTO </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>12.32.1.2. Introduction</h3> 
<p> Most notebooks today come with CD drives. If floppy and CD drive are 
swappable they are usually mutually exclusive, however many vendors (HP, Dell) 
provide cables which allow the floppy module to be connected to the parallel 
port. Sometimes the CD drives comes as externalPCMCIA device (e.g. SONY), or as 
SCSI device (e.g. HP OmniBook 800), USB device (e.g. SONY), or as Firewire 
(e.g. SONY VAIO VX71P). Such an external devices might bear problems to install 
Linux from it.</p> 
<p> As far as I know there are SONY DiscMans available which have a port to 
connect them to a computer or even a SCSI port. I found an article published by 
Ziff-Davis Publishing Company (September 1996 issue, but missed to note the 
URL) written by Mitt Jones: &quot;Portable PC Card CD-ROM drives transform 
laptops into mobile multimedia machines&quot;, which listed: Altec Lansing 
AMC2000 Portable Multimedia CD-ROM Center; Axonix ProMedia 6XR; CMS 
PlatinumPortable; EXP CDS420 Multimedia Kit; H45 QuickPCMCIA CD; Liberty 115CD; 
Panasonic KXL-D740; Sony PRD-250WN CD-ROM Discman.</p> 
<p> To here music from internal CD drives usually works without problems. But 
note:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Some notebooks come with an external CD drive, you need an extra cable to 
connect the sound output of the drive to the sound input of the notebook.</p> 
<br> <br>

<h2>12.32.2. CD-RW</h2> 
<p> Most notebooks today even come with internal or external CD writers. The 
internal usually work, seeCD-Writing-HOWTO for details. But with the different 
external (PCMCIA, Firewire, USB) drives you probably need some tweaking.</p> 
<h2>12.32.3. DVD Drive</h2>

Also provided on the site are links to various documents discussingDVD chipset 
specifications. The Linux Video andDVD Project is avidly seeking help from the 
opensource community for development. See alsoDVD-Playback-HOWTO . </p> 
<p> Universal Disk Format (UDF) Driver : &quot;UDF is a newer CDROM filesystem 
standard that's required forDVD roms. It's meant to be a replacement for the 
ISO9660 filesystem used on today's CDROMs, but the immediate impact for most 
will be DVD.DVD multimedia cdroms use the UDF filesystem to contain MPEG audio 
and video streams. To accessDVD cdroms you would need a DVD cdrom drive, the 
kernel driver for the cdrom drive, some kind of MPEG video support, and a UDF 
filesystem driver (like this one). SomeDVD cdroms may contain both UDF 
filesystems and ISO9660 filesystems. In that case, you could get by without UDF 
support.&quot;</p>

<h1>12.33. Hard Disk</h1> 
<h2>12.33.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> Useful programms are <b>hdparm</b>, <b>dmesg</b>, <b>fsck</b> and <b>fdisk
</b> . </p> 
<h2>12.33.2. Utilities</h2> 
<p> The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and 
smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, 
Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA and 
SCSI hard disks. In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning 
of disk degradation and failure.</p> 
<p> The hddtemp utility can read the temperature of S.M.A.R.T. hard disks. </p>
<h2>12.33.3. Miscellaneous</h2> 
<p> Be careful when using your laptop abroad. I have heard about some 
destroyed harddisks due to a magnetic field emitted from the magnetic-holds at 
the backresttable of the seats in a German railway waggon.</p> 
<p> Though I am quite satisfied with the quality of the hard disk in my 
laptop, when I removed it from the case I unintendedly dropped it. I recommend 
to be very careful.</p> 
<h2>12.33.4. Form Factors</h2> 
<p> AFAIK there is only one form factor for harddisks used in laptops the 
2.5&quot; format. This format seems to be available in different heights 
(Please note I couldn't verify this information yet):</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> 18mm: laptops built before 1996 usually have drives 18mm high </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 12.7mm: I got a report about such disks but without a notebook model or 
manufacturer name</p></li> 
<li>
<p> 11mm: since 1996 the drives are 11mm high </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 9mm: many laptops, including the subnotebooks, now use a 9mm-high disk 
drive. The largest available in this format in late 1999 isIBM&trade; <em>12GN
</em>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 9.5mm: Toshiba Libretto L70 and L100 have a 9.5mm HD </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 8.45mm: Toshiba Libretto 20, 30, 50 and 60 have 8.45mm tall HDs </p></li> 
<li>
<p> 6.35mm: Toshiba Libretto L1000 has a 6.35mm HD </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> It might be possible to use a hard disk wich doesn't fit with some case 
modifications.</p> 
<p> Some laptops come with a removable hard disk in a tray, for instance the 
KAPOK 9600D. There seem to be no SCSI drives for laptops available.</p> 
<h2>12.33.5. Manufacturer Tools</h2> 
<p> Some hard disk manufacturers offer dedicated tools to change hard disk 
parameters. For example Hitachi offersDrive Fitness Test (DFT), which provides 
a quick, reliable method to test SCSI and IDE hard disk drives, including 
Serial-ATA IDE drives. The Drive Fitness Test analyze function performs read 
tests without overwriting customer data. (However, Drive Fitness Test is 
bundled with some restoration utilities that will overwrite data.) TheFeature 
Tool is a DOS-bootable tool for changing various ATA features. </p> 
<h1>12.34. Hot-Swapping Devices (MultiBay, SelectBay, ..)</h1> 
<p> Some laptops (usually the more expensive ones) come with a free slot, 
which may bear a second hard disk or CD/DVD drive. Every manufacturer seems to 
name it differently, names like MultiBay(TM) and SelectBay(TM) are common. 
Different Linux tools are available to handle these hot-swapping devices.</p> 
<p> thotswap is part of the Toshiba(tm) Linux Utilities it makes it possible 
to hotswap devices in the SelectBay.</p> 
<p> Hotswap is a utility to register and deregister hotswappable IDE hardware. 
It is written to be used on Laptops with some sort of hardware bay to remove 
the module from the machine without rebooting it. Note that this utility is not 
required to insert or remove batteries or floppy disk drives; only for IDE

<h2>12.35.2. Introduction</h2> 
<p> Many notebooks now come pre-equipped with wireless network support for the 
802.11 protocol family. These devices are either based onminiPCI or PCMCIA. You 
may check that with either<b>lspci</b> or <b>cardctl ident</b>. External WLAN 
adapters are available as PCMCIA or CF-Cards and asUSB devices. Details will 
follow in a later issue.</p> 
<h1>12.36. BlueTooth</h1> 
<p> Some laptops come pre-equipped with built-in BlueTooth support, but I had 
no time to investigate that any further. Actually I do not have such a machine 
to test Linux on it yet.</p> 
<h1>12.37. Infrared Port</h1> &nbsp; <i>
<p><i>Better red, than dead.</i></p></i> <br>
&nbsp; <i> Unknown AuthorEss </i>
<br> <br>

<h2>12.37.1. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> To get the IrDA&reg; port of your laptop working with Linux/IrDA&reg; you 
may use StandardInfraRed (SIR) or FastInfraRed (FIR).</p> 
<h3>12.37.1.1. SIR</h3> 
<p> Up to 115.200bps, the infrared port emulates a serial port like the 16550A 
UART. This will be detected by the kernel serial driver at boot time, or when 
you load theserial module. If infrared support is enabled in the BIOS, for most 
laptops you will get a kernel message like:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> Serial driver version 4.25 with no serial options enabled ttyS00 at 
0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A #first serial port /dev/ttyS0 ttyS01 at 0x3000 
(irq = 10) is a 16550A #e.g. infrared port ttyS02 at 0x0300 (irq = 3) is a 
16550A #e.g.PCMCIA modem port </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h3>12.37.1.2. FIR</h3> 
<p> If you want to use up to 4Mbps, your machine has to be equipped with a 
certain FIR chip. You need a certain Linux/IrDA&reg; driver to support this 
chip. Therefore you need exact information about the FIR chip. You may get this 
information in one of the following ways:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Read the <em>specification</em> of the machine, though it is very rare 
that you will find enough and reliable information to use with Linux there.</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Try to find out whether the FIR chip is a <em>PCI</em> device. Do a <b>cat 
/proc/pci</b> . The appropriate files for 2.2.x kernels are in /proc/bus/pci . 
Though often the PCI information is incomplete. You may find the latest 
information about PCI devices and vendor numbers in the kernel documentation 
usually in/usr/src/linux/Documentation or at the page of Craig Hart . From 
kernel 2.1.82 on, you may use<b>lspci</b> from the <b>pci-utils</b> package, 
too.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Use the <em>DOS tool</em> <b>CTPCI330.EXE</b> provided in ZIP format by 
the German computer magazine CTftp://www.heise.de/pub/ct/ctsi/ctpci330.zip . 
The information provided by this program is sometimes better than that provided 
by the Linux tools.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Try to get information about <em>Plug-and-Play (PnP)</em> devices. Though 
I didn't use them for this purpose yet, the<b>isapnp</b> tools, could be useful.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> If you have installed the <em>Linux/IrDA&reg; software</em> load the FIR 
modules and watch the output of<b>dmesg</b>, whether FIR is detected or not. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Another way how to figure it out explained by Thomas Davis (modified by 
WH): &quot;Dig through the FTP site of the vendor, find the<em>Windows9x FIR 
drivers</em>, and they have (for a SMC chip): </p> 
<pre> -rw-rw-r-- 1 ratbert ratbert 743 Apr 3 1997 smcirlap.inf -rw-rw-r-- 1 
ratbert ratbert 17021 Mar 24 1997 smcirlap.vxd -rw-rw-r-- 1 ratbert ratbert 
1903 Jul 18 1997 smcser.inf -rw-rw-r-- 1 ratbert ratbert 31350 Jun 7 1997 
smcser.vxd</pre> <br>
<br>
 If in doubt, always look for the .inf/.vxd drivers 
for Windows95. Windows95 doesn't ship with _ANY_ FIR drivers. (they are all 
third party, mostly from Counterpoint, who was assimilated by ESI).&quot;
<p></p></li> 
<li>
<p> Also Thomas Davis found a package of small DOS utilities made by SMC. The 
package contains<b>FINDCHIP.EXE</b>. And includes a <b>FIRSETUP.EXE</b> utility 
that is supposed to be able to set all values except the chip address. 
Furthermore it contains<b>BIOSDUMP.EXE</b>, which produces this output: </p>
<p> Example 1 (from a COMPAQ Armada 1592DT) </p>

<h3>12.37.1.3. Hardware Survey</h3> 
<p> I have made an IrDA hardware survey at TuxMobil . This list also contains 
information about infrared capable devices which are not mentioned here (mice, 
printers, remote control, transceivers, etc.).</p> 
<p> To make this list more valuable, it is necessary to collect more 
information about the infrared devices in different hardware. You can help by 
sending me a short e-mail containing the exact name of the hardware you have 
and which type of infrared controller is used.</p> 
<p> Please let me know also how well Linux/IrDA&reg; worked (at which tty, 
port and interrupt it works and the corresponding infrared device, e.g. 
printer, cellular phone).</p> 
<p> Also you can help by contributing detailed technological information about 
some infrared devices, which is necessary for the development of drivers for 
Linux.</p>

<h3>12.37.3.2. Linux Infrared Remote Control - LIRC</h3> 
<p> Linux Infrared Remote Control LIRC is a package that supports receiving 
and sending IR signals of the most common IR remote controls. It contains a 
device driver for hardware connected to the serial port, a daemon that decodes 
and sends IR signals using this device driver, a mouse daemon that translates 
IR signals to mouse movements and a couple of user programs that allow to 
control your computer with a remote control. I don't have valid information 
about how much infrared remote control is working with laptop infrared devices.

<h2>13.1.2. Linux Compatibility Check</h2> 
<p> With the command <b>cardctl ident</b> you may get information about your 
card. If your card is not mentioned in/etc/pcmcia/config, create a file 
/etc/pcmcia/&lt;MYCARD&gt;.conf appropriately. Take an entry in the first file 
as a model. You may try every driver, just in case it might work, for instance 
the<b>pcnet_cs</b> supports many NE2000 compatible PCMCIA network cards. Note: 
it is a bad practice to edit/etc/pcmcia/config directly, because all changes 
will be lost with the next update. After creating/etc/pcmcia/&lt;MYCARD&gt;.conf
 restart the PCMCIA services. This may not be enough to get the card to work, 
but works sometimes for no-name network cards or modem cards. If you get a card 
to work or have written a new driver please don't forget to announce this tothe 
developer of thePCMCIA-CS package David Hinds. Look at the current issue of 
SUPPORTED.CARDS to get information about supported cards. </p> 
<p> Since not all cards are mentioned there, I have set up a Survey of PCMCIA
/CardBus/CF Cards Supported by Linux. </p> 
<h1>13.2. ExpressCards</h1> 
<p> ExpressCard is the official standard for modular expansion for desktop and 
mobile systems based on PCI-Express. These cards offer a smaller and faster PC 
Card solution. Here is theLinux Hardware Compatibility List - HCL for 
ExpressCards, which includes a survey of Linux installations on laptops and 
notebooks which feature an ExpressCard slot. </p>

SmartCards. </p> 
<h1>13.4. SDIO Cards</h1> 
<p> Looking for Linux drivers for SDIO cards? There is almost nothing 
available yet. But here are at least some pointers.</p> 
<h1>13.5. Memory Technology Devices - RAM and Flash Cards</h1> 
<p> The Linux Memory Technology Device project aims to provide a unified 
subsystem for handling RAM and Flash cards (Memory Technology Devices). It is 
intended to be compatible with the LinuxPCMCIA code, to prevent duplication of 
code and effort, yet its main target is small embedded systems, so it will be 
possible to compile the drivers into the kernel for use as a root filesystem, 
and a close eye will be kept on the memory footprint.</p> 
<h1>13.6. Memory Stick</h1> 
<p> The Memory Stick is a proprietary memory device, in the beginning only 
used in devices made by SONY. But now they are available in mobile computers 
made by other manufacturers, too. The current sticks are USB devices and work 
with all recent kernels. After loading theusb-storage you may mount them as 
SCSI devices, often as/dev/sda or /dev/sdb. For older laptops see the 
appropriate pages at Linux-on-Laptops.</p> 
<p> There is also a SONY Memory Stick Floppy Adapter - MSAC-FD2M. I don't know 
whether this works with Linux.</p> 
<h1>13.7. Card Readers for SD/MMC/Memory Stick</h1> 
<h2>13.7.1. External Readers</h2> 
<p> All external SD/MMC/CF-Card/Memory Stick readers are USB devices and work 
fine with the<b>usb-storage</b> module. The only caveat which might occur is 
that you may have difficulties to determine the device assignment. Just use<b>
dmesg</b> after you have connected the reader. The command should show a SCSI 
device like/dev/sda1 assigned to the USB drive. </p> 
<h2>13.7.2. Internal Readers</h2> 
<p> Currently there are three kinds of devices available: USB, PCMCIA and PCI 
devices.</p> 
<p> USB devices are seldom, but usually work out of the box. They behave like 
the external readers mentioned above.</p> 
<p> Some readers are PCMCIA/CardBus devices. Often such a reader is located 
near the CardBus slot. The command<b>cardctl ident</b> will reveal these cards. 
</p> 
<p> For some laptops and notebooks a driver for the Winbond's W83L518D and 
W83L519D SD/MMC card reader is available. </p> 
<p> Some proprietary devices are not yet known to work with Linux. Except the 
readers built into the SHARP Linux PDAs, but the driver is closed source and 
available as a binary only for the ARM CPU.</p>

<h2>13.8.2. BlueTooth Dongles</h2> 
<p> There are many dongles around. I have made some experience with the 
AIRcable for laptops and PDAs (e.g. SHARP's Zaurus models SL-5x00 and C-7x0). 
This USB dongle kit provides a fast, convenient way of connecting mobile Linux 
computers to another personal computer or notebook computer or mobile phone 
without any cabling. The AIRcable uses a BlueTooth connection without the need 
to set up a complicated BlueTooth configuration. For example: The AIRcable 
Zaurus-USB can be used for syncing the Zaurus (ZaurusManager, Intellisync), for 
Qtopia desktop and for network connections through the PC (Linux, Windows and 
Apple) running pppd. You may find further details and asurvey of compatible 
mobile phones etc. at TuxMobil. </p> 
<h2>13.8.3. Port Replicators/Docking Stations</h2> 
<p> I do not have experience with these devices yet. But I expect that it will 
be difficult, if not impossible, to get them to run with Linux. For other kinds 
of port replicators and docking stations see the appropriate section in the 
laptop chapter.</p>

<h2>13.9.2. Scanner and OCR Software</h2> 
<p> SANE stands for <em>Scanner Access Now Easy</em> and is an application 
programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster 
image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and 
still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is free and its 
discussion and development is open to everybody. The current source code is 
written forUNIX (including Linux) and is available under the GNU public license 
(commercial application and backends are welcome, too, however).</p> 
<p> GOCR is optical character recognition software. It converts PGM files into 
ASC files.</p> 
<p> For scanner drivers see Linux Drivers for Handheld Scanners. </p> 
<h2>13.9.3. Connectivity</h2> 
<p> There are different ways to connect a printer or scanner to a laptop. For 
printers usually: parallel port, serial port,USB and IrDA&reg; port. For 
scanners usually: parallel port, SCSI (viaPCMCIA or generic SCSI port), USB and 
PCMCIA port. All of them need the appropriate kernel drivers. </p> 
<h1>13.10. Serial Devices</h1> 
<h2>13.10.1. Keyspan PDA Serial Adapter</h2> 
<p> Single port DB-9 serial adapter, pushed as a PDA adapter for iMacs (mostly 
sold in Macintosh catalogs, comes in a translucent white/green dongle). Fairly 
simple device.</p> 
<h1>13.11. External Storage Devices</h1> 
<h2>13.11.1. External Hard Disks</h2> 
<p> There are external hard disk cases with different connectors available: 
PCMCIA, USB and FireWire. Cases are available for 2.5&quot; (laptop hard 
disks), 3.5&quot; (desktop hard disks) and 5.25&quot; (CD-Writer). All of them 
work very well together with Linux. Especially I like the cases for 2.5&quot; 
hard disks, you may upgrade your current laptop hard disk and use the old one 
to put it into the external box to extend your hard disk space.</p> 
<p> Caveat: After wake up from suspend mode, the external hard drive can't 
work. To cure this problem these remedies might help: Disconnect the external 
drive and then plug it in again. Or use an AC adapter to power the external 
drive. Though this seems unconvenient in a suspend situation. But since the 
external drive gets the power from the adapter, there is no disconnection from 
power as will be if power is provided from USB.</p> 
<p> Caveat: Take care that the jumpers are set to Master. Almost all external 
hard disk cases will not work when the jumpers are set to Slave or Cable Select.
</p> 
<h1>13.12. Power and Phone Plugs, Power Supply</h1> 
<p> When travelling abroad you might consider to take a set of different power 
and phone plugs with you. Also, it's useful if you can change the input voltage 
of the power supply, for instance from 110V in the US to 220V in Germany. There 
also power supplies for 12V batteries from cars.</p>

</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Though some -O)- shaped plug may seem to be compatible with your laptop, 
because of the appropriate physical size, take extreme care it uses the same 
plus-minus voltage scheme, for instance plus for the inner ring and minus for 
the outer one. Often, but not always, there are the appropriate symbols near 
the plug.</p> <br>

<h1>13.13. Bags and Suitcases</h1> 
<p> You probably wonder, why I include this topic here. But shortly after 
using my COMPAQ Armada 1592DT I recognized that the rear side of the machine 
(where the ports are arranged) was slightly damaged. Though I have taken much 
care when transporting the laptop, this was caused by putting the bag on the 
floor. It seems that the laptop has so much weight, that it bounces inside the 
bag on its own rear side. So I decided to put a soft pad into the bag before 
loading the laptop. A good bag is highly recommended if you take your laptop on 
trips, or take it home every night.</p> 
<p> Laptops computers are frequently demolished in their carrying bag. The two 
main causes of demolition are poking the LC display and banging the edges. A 
good case has very stiff sides to spread out pokes, and lots of 
energy-absorbent padding around the edges to help when you whack it on the door 
jamb. Few cases actually have either of these features.</p> 
<p> More laptops are lost to theft than damage, so camouflage is a wise too.

<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> The one I use has a microwavable heating pad in it - while I don't 
actually heat this pad (it's meant to keep food warm while in transport), it 
does provide padding underneath the laptop. The carrier I have only has a lower

heating - pad and an upper - cooling - pad - placed in the freezer to get it 
cold - -- the intent is that you keep one or the other in the bag to keep your 
food hot or cold as desired. A secondary advantage to the - cooling pad - pad 
is that if you've - chilled - it before taking the computer out for the day, it 
will keep the CPU cooler while you're running the laptop...</p></li> 
<li>
<p> the top of the bag has a zipper on three sides, so it - opens - the same 
way as my laptop - I don't even need to take it out of the carrier to use the

<li>
<p> there is enough room at the side of the bag to store the external power 
supply, a regular Logitech mouseman, and the network - dongle - with BNC/TP

<li>
<p> there is enough clearance on top of the machine to include a handful of 
CD's or diskettes, if needed.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> when it's left - unattended - in a car, it's less likely to be stolen - 
think about it, if you were a thief walking through a parking lot and eyeing 
the contents of cars, a - laptop bag - is instantly recognizable as holding a 
laptop computer - something that can be fenced at a pretty hefty profit, but if 
you saw a casserole carrier in the front seat of a car, would you think it 
contained anything OTHER than a casserole? - and probably half-eaten, at 
that... - Unless you are a hungry thief, chances are you'll skip this and move 
on.</p></li>

<p> likewise, I've heard that keeping a laptop computer in a diaper bag is

<h1>Chapter 14. Kernel History</h1> 
<p> The kernel chapter isn't ready yet. Just some notes about important 
changes with kernel 2.4 and 2.6 related to mobile computers. As well as some 
notes about Kernel configurations for laptops.</p> 
<h1>14.1. Kernel 2.4</h1> 
<h2>14.1.1. PCMCIA</h2> 
<p> From PCMCIA.ORG: &quot; PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card 
International Association) is an international standards body and trade 
association with over 200 member companies that was founded in 1989 to 
establish standards for Integrated Circuit cards and to promote 
interchangeability among mobile computers where ruggedness, low power, and 
small size were critical. As the needs of mobile computer users have changed, 
so has the PC Card Standard. By 1991, PCMCIA had defined an I/O interface for 
the same 68 pin connector initially used for memory cards. At the same time, 
the Socket Services Specification was added and was soon followed by the Card 
Services Specifcation as developers realized that common software would be 
needed to enhance compatibility. &quot; The cards are available in different 
formats: Type I, II, III.</p> 
<p> A quotation from the ../Documentation/Changes file: &quot;PCMCIA (PC Card) 
support is now partially implemented in the main kernel source. Pay attention 
when you recompile your kernel. If you need to use the<b>PCMCIA-CS</b> modules, 
then don't compile the kernel's PCMCIA support. If you don't need to use the 
PCMCIA-CS modules (i.e. all the drivers you need are in the kernel sources), 
then don't compile them; you won't need anything in there. Also, be sure to 
upgrade to the latest<b>PCMCIA-CS</b> release.&quot; Further information you 
may get from the README-2.4 included with this package.</p> 
<p> You may find an example kernel configuration for laptops in the Section 
14.3. </p> 
<h2>14.1.2. Powermanagement</h2> 
<p> At the moment there are two power management drivers in the linux kernel 
(AFAIK). They each have different userspace interfaces/proc/apm/ and 
/dev/apmctl/ and /proc/acpi/ or something. </p> 
<p> For further information see the page of John Fremlin . He has also written 
a program named<b>powermanager</b>. </p> 
<p> With kernel 2.4 there is ACPI available, see ACPI chapter below. </p> 
<p> The SuSE Powersave Daemon provides battery, temperature, AC, and CPU 
frequency control and monitoring along with proper suspend to disk/RAM and 
standby support with shell hooks that are easy to extend. It supports APM and 
ACPI machines and can control a hard disk's advanced power and acoustic 
management settings. It is perfect for laptops and workstations that need to 
run quietly with low power consumption, or switch to full performance mode if 
needed. Self definable power schemes give full control over power control 
features and allow easy and automatic switching between performance or power 
saving settings for each hardware component.</p> 
<h2>14.1.3. Hotplug</h2> 
<p> There is a new mailing list for developers interested in any aspects of 
the Linux kernel hotplug ability and functionality. This would include (but is 
not restricted to) USB, PCMCIA, SCSI, Firewire, and probably PCI developers. 
There is an initialSourceForge site. </p> 
<p> Kernel Support for Hot-Plugable Devices </p> 
<pre> CONFIG_HOTPLUG Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer 
while the system is running, and be able to use them quickly. In many cases, 
the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too. One well known example 
of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card size devices such as network cards, 
modems or hard drives which are plugged into slots found on all modern laptop 
computers. Another example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB. 
Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel. Getagent software and 
install it. Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode 
&quot;policy agent&quot; (<b>/sbin/hotplug</b>) to load modules and set up 
software needed to use devices as you hotplug them.</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h1>14.2. Kernel 2.6</h1> 
<h2>14.2.1. PCMCIA</h2> 
<p> PCMCIAutils contains hotplug scripts and initialization tools necessary to 
allow the PCMCIA subsystem to behave (almost) as every other hotpluggable bus 
system (e.g. USB, IEEE1394). Please note that the kernel support for this new 
feature is only present since 2.6.13-rc1.</p> 
<h1>14.3. Kernel Configuration for Laptops</h1> 
<p> You may find an example for 2.4.x kernels here Please note: <em>Don't</em> 
use this file by default, please use always<b>make config</b>, <b>make 
menuconfig</b> or <b>make xconfig</b> to create a kernel configuration file. See
Kernel-HOWTO (from TLDP) for details. Thomas Hertweck has written another useful
Linux-Kernel-HOWTO (but it is only available in German and Italian). </p> 
<p> laptopkernel is a patchset for the Linux kernel containing several useful 
patches for laptop-users. It contains acpi, software suspend, supermount and 
some hardware compatibility patches. Unfortunately this project is not 
maintained anymore since 2003.</p>

<p> If you are using Debian GNU/Linux then you should refer to the Debian 
Reference chapter entitled &quot;Network configuration&quot;. Debian contains a 
number of packages that help to make roaming among different networks 
effortless.</p> 
<h1>15.2. Configuration Tools</h1> 
<h2>15.2.1. NetEnv</h2> 
<p> Do you use your laptop in different network environments? At home? In the 
office? At a customers site?</p> 
<p> If yes, the small package &quot;netenv&quot; might be useful for you. When 
booting your laptop it provides you with a simple interface from which you can 
choose the current network environment. The first time in a new environment, 
you can enter the basic data and save it for later reuse.</p> 
<p> Netenv sets up a file containing variable assignments which describe the 
current environment. This can be used by thePCMCIA setup scheme, e.g. like the 
one that comes with Debian/GNU Linux and perhaps others.</p> 
<p> The netenv data can be used for things like: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Network Device: Configure the network device for different environments. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Choose a proper XF86Config: Think of using your laptop standalone with 
touchpad vs. connected to a CRT monitor along with an external mouse. For 
example, a wheel mouse could be used when docked, but the driver is not 
compatible with the normal trackpoint or touchpad.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Windowmanager: You can set up your windowmanager appropriate to the 
current location of your machine.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Printing Environment: The netenv data can easily be used to set up the 
printing environment.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> Netenv is available at netenv home. It depends on <b>dialog(1)</b> for its 
menu interface. Netenv was developed by Gerd Bavendiek.</p> 
<h2>15.2.2. System Configuration Profile Management - SCPM</h2> 
<p> SuSE's System Configuration Profile Management - SCPM software allows you 
to switch configuration profiles. You can boot directly into one profile and 
then switch to another profile at run time. This is the successor of SuSE's 
older &quot;scheme&quot; management software.</p> 
<h2>15.2.3. ifplugd</h2> 
<p> ifplugd is a lightweight Linux daemon which configures the network 
automatically when a cable is plugged in and deconfigures it when the cable is 
pulled. It is primarily intended for usage with laptops. It relies on the 
distribution's native network configuration subsystem, and is thus not very 
intrusive.</p> 
<h2>15.2.4. divine</h2> 
<p> divine is an utility for people who use their machines in different 
networks all the time. &quot;The idea is this:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> you describe the possible networks in /etc/divine.conf, including one or 
more machines that are probably up (routers and NIS servers come to mind).</p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> at boot time, you run divine. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>divine</b> starts a thread that injects fake arp requests into the 
network. The thread will try again up to three times, pausing 1 second between 
retries. If the last try times out again, the thread will print an error 
message, leave the interface in the original state and exit cleanly.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> the main thread just looks for arp replies and exits if one is found. </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> You have one resolv.conf per network, for example /etc/resolv.conf.default 
and/etc/resolv.conf.work. <b>divine</b> will symlink one of them to 
/etc/resolv.conf for you. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> You can specify a proxy server plus port and divine will write the proxy 
server to/etc/proxy. This can be evaluated inside your shell startup script, 
like this (<b>zsh</b>): </p> 
<pre> export http_proxy=&quot;http://`&lt;/etc/proxy`/&quot; </pre> <br>
<br>
 
The included perl script edit-netscape-proxy.pl will edit the proxy settings in 
your Netscape 4 preferences file.
<p></p></li> 
<li>
<p> You can even specify an additional script to be run for each selection. 
You can use this to edit/etc/printcap or /etc/issue or do something else I 
forgot.</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> The point about <b>divine</b> in contrast to other solutions is that other 
solutions normally use<b>ping</b> or something like that. <b>divine</b> can 
check a large number of networks instantaneously, assuming that the machines 
you ping answer within one second (.4 seconds are normal on Ethernets). And 
pinging an unknown address will do an arp request anyway, so why not do an arp 
request in the first place?&quot;</p> 
<h2>15.2.5. Mobile IP</h2> 
<p> From the Networking-HOWTO : &quot;The term <em>IP Mobility</em> describes 
the ability of a host that is able to move its network connection from one 
point on the Internet to another without changing its IP address or losing 
connectivity. Usually when an IP host changes its point of connectivity it must 
also change its IP address. IP Mobility overcomes this problem by allocating a 
fixed IP address to the mobile host and using IP encapsulation (tunneling) with 
automatic routing to ensure that datagrams destined for it are routed to the 
actual IP address it is currently using.&quot;</p> 
<p> HUT Mobile IP is a dynamical, hierarchical Mobile IP system for Linux 
operating system. The implementation enables a hierarchical model for IP 
mobility, thus decreasing the location update times as a mobile host moves. 
Dynamics system has been designed Wireless LAN technology in mind, and the 
system has optimized functionality for mobility in WLAN. There is now a mailing 
list available. You can join it by sending<em>subscribe</em> on the subject 
line to &lt;dynamics-user-request_at_cs.hut.fi&gt; - or you can simply check the
mail archive. </p>

<h2>15.2.6. DHCP/BootP</h2> 
<p> DHCP and BootP are also useful for working in different environments. 
Please see theDHCP-HOWTO . </p> 
<h2>15.2.7. PPPD Options</h2> 
<p> The <b>pppd</b> command can be configured via several different files: <b>
pppd file /etc/ppp/&lt;your_options&gt;</b> . </p> 
<h2>15.2.8. /etc/init.d</h2> 
<p> You may even choose to do your configuration by editing the /etc/init.d 
files manually.</p> 
<h2>15.2.9. PCMCIA - Schemes</h2> 
<p> How can I have separate PCMCIA device setups for home and work? This is 
fairly easy usingPCMCIA <em>scheme</em> support. Use two configuration schemes, 
called<b>home</b> and <b>work</b>. For details please read the appropriate 
chapter in thePCMCIA-HOWTO. </p> 
<h2>15.2.10. Bootloaders</h2> 
<h3>15.2.10.1. LILO</h3> 
<p> From Martin J. Evans I have taken this recommendation: The first point to 
note is that<b>init</b> will take any arguments of the form <b>name=value</b> 
as environment variable assignments if they are not recognized as something 
else. This means you can set environment variables from the LILO boot prompt 
before your rc scripts run. I set the<b>LOCATION</b> environment variable 
depending on where I am when I boot Linux. e.g.</p> 
<pre> LILO: linux LOCATION=home </pre> <br>
<br>
 Or 
<pre> LILO: linux LOCATION=work </pre> <br>
<br>
 Or simply 
<pre> LILO: linux </pre> <br>
<br>
 where failing to set <b>LOCATION</b> means 
the same as<b>LOCATION=home</b> (i.e. my default). Instead of typing <b>
LOCATION=place</b> each time you boot you can add an entry to your 
/etc/lilo.conf file and use the append instruction. e.g. 
<pre> # Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at home # image = /vmlinuz 
root = /dev/hda3 label = linux read-only # Linux bootable partition config ends 
# # Linux bootable partition for booting Linux at work # image = /vmlinuz root 
= /dev/hda3 label = work read-only append=&quot;LOCATION=work&quot; # Linux 
bootable partition config ends</pre> <br>
<br>
 With the example above you can 
use &quot;linux&quot; for booting at home and &quot;work&quot; for booting at 
work.
<p></p> 
<p> Armed with the facility above, you can now edit the relevant rc scripts to 
test ENVIRONMENT before running<b>ifconfig</b>, setting up <b>route</b> etc. 
</p> 
<h3>15.2.10.2. Other Bootloaders</h3> 
<p> There are several other bootloaders which are often overlooked. Besides 
LILO, have a look at loadlin, CHooseOS (CHOS) (not GPL), GRand Unified 
Bootloader (GRUB), System Commander and take a look at
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/boot/loaders/ . The MicroSoft Windows-NT 
boot loader or OS/2 boot loader may even be used.</p> 
<h2>15.2.11. X-Windows</h2> 
<p> From Steve &lt;steve_AT_cygnet.co.uk&gt; I got a configuration for X 
Windows with an external monitor: Note that I have introduced a neat trick! For 
my nice 17&quot; monitor I start X11 with no options and get the default 16-bit 
1152x864 display - but when using theLCD screen I specify a 15-bit display (<b>
startx -- -bpp 15</b>) and get the correct 800x600 resolution automatically. 
This saves having to have two X11 config files.</p> 
<h2>15.2.12. More Info</h2> 
<p> Using a Laptop in Different Environments by Gerd Bavendiek . This article 
appeared in the August, 1997 issue of theLinux Gazette . This is an excellent, 
short technical article describing an easy way to setup your Linux notebook to 
boot into different network and printing configurations, especially useful for 
those who use their machines at home as well as other locations such as in the 
office, at school, or at a customer site.</p> 
<h1>15.3. E-Mail</h1> 
<h2>15.3.1. Introduction</h2> 
<p> A short introduction about how to setup email on a laptop used at home 
(dial-up) and work (ethernet) by Peter Englmaier &lt;ppe_AT_pa.uky.edu&gt;:</p> 
<h3>15.3.1.1. Features</h3> 
<p> As a laptop user, I have special demands for my email setup. The setup 
described below, enables me to:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Read my email from <em>home</em> using a POP email server, which is 
supplied by my university, but could also be setup on a<em>work</em> place 
computer.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Write email from home with the <em>right</em> return address in the email 
(which does not mention my computer name).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Read/write my email while working on a workstation without access to my 
laptop or the POP email server (as a backup).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Read my email while working on my laptop connected to the ethernet of our 
institut.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Direct email while connected via ethernet (faster than the fetchmail 
method).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Indirect email (over pop mail server) while not connected to the ethernet 
at work (either at home via modem or somewhere else via ethernet).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Use any emailer, e.g. <b>elm</b> or the simple <b>mail</b> command. </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Sort incoming email, delete spam, split email-collections (digests) into 
seperate emails</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> The configuration is based on <b>sendmail</b>, <b>fetchmail</b>, and a <em>
remote pop account</em> for email. </p> 
<h3>15.3.1.2. Configuration of sendmail</h3> 
<p> This is the most complicated part. Having installed the <b>sendmail-cf</b> 
package, I created a file named/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/laptop.mc: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> divert(-1) include(`../m4/cf.m4') define(`confDEF_USER_ID',''8:12'') 
define(`confBIND_OPTS',`-DNSRCH -DEFNAMES') # here you define your domain 
define(`confDOMAIN_NAME',''pa.uky.edu'') OSTYPE(`linux') undefine(`UUCP_RELAY') 
undefine(`BITNET_RELAY') # there we send outgoing email 
define(`SMART_HOST',`server1.pa.uky.edu') # there we send mail to users my 
laptop does not know define(`LUSER_RELAY',`server1.pa.uky.edu') # again the 
domain, we want to be seen as MASQUERADE_AS(pa.uky.edu) FEATURE(allmasquerade) 
FEATURE(nouucp) FEATURE(nodns) FEATURE(nocanonify) FEATURE(redirect) 
FEATURE(always_add_domain) FEATURE(use_cw_file) FEATURE(local_procmail) 
MAILER(procmail) MAILER(smtp) HACK(check_mail3,`hash -a@JUNK /etc/mail/deny') 
HACK(use_ip,`/etc/mail/ip_allow') HACK(use_names,`/etc/mail/name_allow') 
HACK(use_relayto,`/etc/mail/relay_allow') HACK(check_rcpt4) HACK(check_relay3)
</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> This looks more complicated as it is. All it does is, that it redirectes 
outbound mail to server1 (SMART_HOST) and also mail for local users which are 
not known (LUSER_RELAY). That way, I can write email to my colleques without 
using their full email address. More important: the From line in my email 
points back to my MASQUARADE_AS domain and not directly to my laptop. If this 
where not the case, email returned with the<em>reply</em> button might not 
reach me. You must restart<b>sendmail</b> for changes to take effect. Note: 
this configuration is for Redhat 5.2 systems. You may have to change some 
details.</p> 
<p> Now, all what is needed is to generate the /etc/sendmail.cf file <b>m4 
laptop.mc &gt;/etc/sendmail.cf</b> and to add all possible domain names my 
laptop should respond to in/etc/sendmail.cw: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> # sendmail.cw - include all aliases for your machine here. laptop 
laptop.pa.uky.edu 128.17.18.30 guest1 guest1.somewhere.org</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> It is important to have all aliases in this file, otherwise <b>sendmail</b>
 will not accept the mail (and will reply<em>we don't relay</em> to the 
sender). Finally, you must now test the setup by sending email, replying to 
mail for all possible configurations. Any missconfiguration can result in loss 
of email.</p> 
<h3>15.3.1.3. Configuration for fetchmail on Laptop</h3> 
<p> One method to get the email into your machine is through <b>fetchmail</b>. 
Fetchmail periodically checks for new email at one or more remote mail servers. 
I use the following fetchmail configuration file (in my user home directory):
fetchmailrc </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> set postmaster &quot;myusername&quot; set daemon 900 poll pop.uky.edu 
with proto POP3 user &quot;mypopusername&quot; there with password 
&quot;mypoppassword&quot; is mylaptopusername here</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> Fetchmail will just get the email and send it to <b>sendmail</b> which 
will it deliver into your/var/spool/mail/$USER file. </p> 
<h3>15.3.1.4. Forward E-Mail to the Laptop</h3> 
<p> On my work station I have the following .forward file: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> me@pop.acount.edu,me@server1 </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> Here server1 is the machine where I keep my mailbox. All email is send to 
the pop account to be picked up later by my laptop (using<b>fetchmail</b>). 
However, when my laptop is connected via ethernet, I want my email to go 
directly to the laptop, instead of pop:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> me@laptop,me@server1 </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> In both cases, a backup of my email is send to server1 (where I also can 
read it, in case I cannot get my laptop). I keep/store all email on the laptop.
</p> 
<p> Switching is done by three script files and a crontab file (on the 
workstation):</p> 
<p> forward_pop </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> #!/bin/sh echo &quot;me@pop.acount.edu,me@server1&quot; &gt; 
${HOME}/.forward</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> forward_laptop </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> #!/bin/sh echo &quot;ppe@laptop,ppe@server1&quot; &gt; ${HOME}/.forward 
crontab ${HOME}/mycrontab ${HOME}/utl/check_laptop</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> check_laptop </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> #!/bin/sh if /usr/sbin/ping -c 1 laptop &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ; then 
: else # redirect mail to pop ${HOME}/utl/forward_pop sleep 10 if 
/usr/sbin/ping -c 1 laptop &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ; then # back to normal 
${HOME}/utl/forward_laptop else # deactivate crontab check /bin/crontab -l | 
grep -v check_laptop &gt;${HOME}/tmp/mycrontab.tmp /bin/crontab 
${HOME}/tmp/mycrontab.tmp rm -f ${HOME}/tmp/mycrontab.tmp fi fi</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> mycrontab </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> # mycrontab 0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * ${HOME}/utl/check_laptop </pre> <br>
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p> Each time I connect the laptop to the ethernet, I have to run <b>
forward_laptop</b>, and each time I disconnect I run forward_pop. In case I 
forget to run<b>forward_pop</b>, the crontab job runs it for me less then 10 
minutes later. To do all that automatically, I change the network script files 
on my laptop as follows:</p> 
<p> /sbin/ifdown (this script runs, whenever a network device is stopped, new 
stuff between BEGIN and END)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> ... fi # BEGIN new stuff # turn off forwarding email mail ppe 
&lt;&lt;EOF turning off forwarding email device = ${DEVICE} hostname = 
`hostname` EOF if [ &quot;${DEVICE}&quot; = &quot;eth0&quot; -a 
&quot;`hostname`&quot; = &quot;laptop&quot; ]; then su -lc &quot;ssh -l 
myusername server1 utl/forward_pop&quot; myusername &gt;&amp; /dev/null fi # 
END new stuff ifconfig ${DEVICE} down exec 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown-post $CONFIG</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> Note, that the script checks for the value of hostname. In case, I am 
connected to a foreign ethernet, my hostname and ip-address will be something 
else, e.g. guest1.</p> 
<p> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post (this script is run, whenever a 
network device is started)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> # Notify programs that have requested notification do_netreport # BEGIN 
new stuff # check for email -- I'm using fetchmail for this if [ 
&quot;${DEVICE}&quot; = &quot;eth0&quot; -o &quot;${DEVICE}&quot; = 
&quot;ppp0&quot; ]; then su -lc fetchmail myusername &gt;&amp; /dev/null &amp; 
fi # set clock if connected to ethernet, redirect email if [ 
&quot;${DEVICE}&quot; = &quot;eth0&quot; -a &quot;`hostname`&quot; = 
&quot;zaphod&quot; ]; then ( rdate -s server1 ; hwclock --systohc --utc ) 
&gt;&amp; /dev/null &amp; # forward email su -lc &quot;ssh -l myusername gradj 
utl/forward_laptop&quot; myusername &gt;&amp; /dev/null &amp; fi # END new 
stuff exit 0</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h3>15.3.1.5. Processing Incoming E-Mail with procmail</h3> 
<p> This step is completely optional. The above described sendmail 
configuration calls<b>procmail</b> for each received email, but you could have 
called<b>procmail</b> using the <b>.forward</b> file (see the procmail man 
page). Procmail is a handy tool to block spam and to sort incoming email.</p> 
<p> You need to setup a <b>.procmailrc</b> file to use <b>procmail</b>. See 
the man page for procmail, procmailrc, and procmailex (examples). My setup 
demonstrates, how to ignore certain email messages and split email-collections 
(digest) into pieces:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> # -- mail filtering -- procmail is called by sendmail -- 
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from # keep in mind: # 
use &quot;:0:&quot; when writing to a file # use &quot;:0&quot; when writing to 
a device, e.g. /dev/null, or send email # - make a backup of *all* incoming 
mail, but ignore mail tagged below - :0 c: *! ^Sissa-Repro backup # - keep only 
last 50 messages :0 ic | cd backup &amp;&amp; rm -f dummy `ls -t msg.* | sed -e 
1,50d` # - delete email coming through the 'postdocs' email list, when # it is 
not of any interest :0 * ^From.*postdocs * ^From.*Ernst Richter /dev/null :0 * 
^From.*postdocs * ^Subject.*card charge /dev/null # Split mailing list from the 
sissa preprint server into individual emails # - this is quite complicated :( I 
can flip through the list much # faster and ignore preprints which have 
uninteresting titles. Instead of # having to browse through the whole list, my 
mailer will just present a # list of papers. # 1. split it in individual 
messages :0 * ^From no-reply@xxx.lanl.gov | formail +1 -de -A 
&quot;Sissa-Repro: true&quot; -s procmail # 2. reformat messages a bit # 2.1. 
extract 'Title:' from email-Body and add to email-header as 'Subject:' :0 b * 
^Sissa-Repro *! ^Subject TITLE=| formail -xTitle: :0 a |formail -A 
&quot;Subject: $TITLE &quot; -s procmail # 2.2. store in my incoming 
sissa-email folder. Here, we could # also reject (and thereafter delete) 
uninteresting 'Subjects' # we could also mark more interesting subjects as 
urgend or send a copy # to regular mail box. :0: * ^Sissa-Repro * ^Subject *! 
^replaced with sissa</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> By the way, there is a <b>tk</b> GUI tool to configure <b>procmail</b> (I 
think it is called<b>dotfiles</b>). </p> 
<h2>15.3.2. Email with UUCP</h2> 
<p> Another possible solution for Email is to use UUCP. This software was made 
for disconnected machines, and is by far the easiest solution if you have 
several users on your laptop (we are talking aboutUNIX, remember?), each with 
his/her own account.</p> 
<p> Unlike what most people think, UUCP does not need a serial connection: it 
works fine over TCP/IP, so your UUCP partner can be any machine on the 
Internet, if it is reachable from your network attachment point. Here is the 
UUCPsys for a typical laptop: </p> 
<pre> system mylaptop time any chat &quot;&quot; \d\d\r\c ogin: \d\L word: \P 
address uucp.mypartner.org port TCP</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>15.3.3. MailSync</h2> 
<p> Mailsync is a way of synchronizing a collection of mailboxes. The 
algorithm is a 3-way diff. Two mailboxes are simultaneously compared to a 
record of the state of both mailboxes at last sync. New messages and message 
deletions are propagated between the two mailboxes. Mailsync can synchronize 
local mailbox files in many formats and remote mailboxes over IMAP, POP, and 
IMAPS.</p> 
<h1>15.4. Data Transport Between Different Machines (Syncronization)</h1> 
<p> I don't have experience with this topic yet. So just a survey about some 
means of data transport and maintaining data consistency between different 
machines.</p> 
<h2>15.4.1. Useful Hardware</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> external harddisks </p></li> 
<li>
<p> ZIP drive </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> Wade Hampton wrote: &quot;You may use MS-DOS formatted ZIP and floppy 
discs for data transfer. You may be able to also use LS120. If you have SCSI, 
you could use JAZ, MO or possibly DVD-RAM (any SCSI disc that you could write

automount</b> to mount it). I use VFAT on the ZIP disks so I can move them to 
Windows boxes, Linux boxes, NT, give them to coworkers, etc. One problem, I 
must SHUTDOWN to swap the internal CD with the ZIP.&quot;</p> 
<h2>15.4.2. Useful Software</h2> 
<h3>15.4.2.1. Version Management Software</h3> 
<p> Although it is certainly not their main aim, version management software 
like CVS (Concurrent Version System) are a perfect tool when you work on 
several machines and you have trouble keeping them in sync (something which is 
often called&quot;disconnected filesystems&quot; in the computer science 
literature). Unlike programs like<b>rsync</b>, which are asymmetric (one side 
is the master and its files override those of the slave), CVS accept that you 
make changes on several machines, and try afterwards to merge them. Asymmetric 
tools are good only when you can respect a strict discipline, when you switch 
from one machine to another. On the contrary, tools like CVS are more forgetful.
</p> 
<p> To synchronize two or more machines (typically a desktop and a laptop), 
just choose a CVS repository somewhere on the network. It can be on one of the 
machines you want to synchronize or on a third host. Anyway, this machine 
should be easily reachable via the network and have good disks.</p> 
<p> Then, <b>cvs co</b> the module you want to work on, edit it, and <b>cvs 
commit</b> when you reached a synch point and are connected. If you made 
changes on both hosts, CVS will try to merge them (it typically succeeds 
automatically) or give in and ask you to resolve it by hand.</p> 
<p> The typical limits of this solution: CVS does not deal well with binary 
files, so this solution is more for users of vi or emacs than for GIMP fans. 
CVS has trouble with someUNIX goodies like symbolic links. </p> 
<p> For more information on CVS, see the Web page . The CVS documentation is 
excellent (in info format).</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.2. CODA Filesystem</h3> 
<p> The CODA File System is a descendant of the Andrew File System. Like AFS, 
Coda offers location-transparent access to a sharedUNIX file name-space that is 
mapped on to a collection of dedicated file servers. But Coda represents a 
substantial improvement over AFS because it offers considerably higher 
availability in the face of server and network failures. The improvement in 
availability is achieved using the complementary techniques of server 
replication and disconnected operation. Disconnected operation proven 
especially valuable in supporting portable computers .</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.3. unison</h3> 
<p> unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two 
replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different 
hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then 
brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other. 
Unison was written by researchers with an eye for well-defined replication 
semantics: they were very fussy about safety, and made sure to handle 
gracefully things like premature termination etc. Unison is 
symmetric/bidirectional (unlike rsync), works fine with binaries (unlike cvs), 
and is a user-level program (unlike most distributed filesystems). It also 
makes a reasonable attempt to synchronize transparently between Unix/Linux and 
Windows filesystems, which is no small feat. Drawbacks: it does not do version 
control, and does not handle synchronization among more than 2 file trees.<b>
unison</b> shares a number of features with tools such as configuration 
management packages (<b>CVS</b>, <b>PRCS</b>, etc.) distributed filesystems ( 
CODA , etc.) <em>uni-directional</em> mirroring utilities (<b>rsync</b>, etc.) 
and other synchronizers ( Intellisync, Reconcile, etc). However, there are a 
number of points where it differs:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> <b>unison</b> runs on both MicroSoft-Windows (95, 98, NT, and 2k) and Unix 
(Solaris, Linux, etc.) systems ( for ARM based Linux PDAs see theTuxMobil IPK 
feed . Moreover, <b>unison</b> works <em>across</em> platforms, allowing you to 
synchronize a Microsoft-Windows laptop with a Unix server, for example.</p></li>
<li>
<p> Unlike a distributed filesystem, <b>unison</b> is a user-level program: 
there is no need to hack (or own!) the kernel, or to have superuser privileges 
on either host.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, <b>unison</b> can deal with 
updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates that do 
not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and 
displayed.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>unison</b> works between any pair of machines connected to the 
internet, communicating over either a direct socket link or tunneling over an<b>
rsh</b> or an encrypted <b>ssh</b> connection. It is careful with network 
bandwidth, and runs well over slow links such as PPP connections.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>unison</b> has a clear and precise specification. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>unison</b> is resilient to failure. It is careful to leave the replicas 
and its own private structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case 
of abnormal termination or communication failures.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> <b>unison</b> is free; full source code is available under the GNU Public 
License.</p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>15.4.2.4. MultiSync</h3> 
<p> Tsync (Transparent) Synchronization is a user-level daemon that provides 
transparent synchronization amongst a set of computers. Tsync uses a 
peer-to-peer architecture for scalability, efficiency, and robustness.</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.5. MultiSync</h3> 
<p> MultiSync is a free modular program to synchronize calendars, address 
books, and other PIM data between programs on your computer and other 
computers, mobile devices, PDAs or cell phones. Currently MultiSync has plugins 
for Ximian Evolution calendars and IrMC Mobile Client calendars (supported by 
the Sony/Ericsson T68i) via Bluetooth, IrDA, or a cable connection.</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.6. mirrordir</h3> 
<p> Mirrordir is a suite of functions in one package. It contains a remote 
login utility and daemon that provides a secure shell, a cp equivalent which 
additionally copies to and from ftp servers, a tool to mirror filesystems over 
ftp or locally, and another utility you can pass a C script to recursively 
perform operations on files.</p> 
<p> <b>mirrordir</b> forces the mirror directory to be an exact replica of the 
control directory tree in every possible detail suitable for purposes of timed 
backup. Files whose modification times or sizes differ are copied. File 
permissions, ownerships, modification times, access times, and sticky bits are 
duplicated. Devices, pipes, and symbolic and hard links are duplicated. Files 
or directories that exist in the mirror directory that don't exist in the 
control directory are deleted. It naturally descends into subdirectories to all 
their depths.</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.7. InterMezzo</h3> 
<p> InterMezzo is a new distributed file system with a focus on high 
availability. InterMezzo is an Open Source project, currently on Linux (2.2 and 
2.3). A primary target of development is to provide support for flexible 
replication of directories, with disconnected operation and a persistent cache. 
For example, we want to make it easy to manage copies of home directories on 
multiple computers, and solve the laptop/desktop synchronization problems. On a 
larger scale we aim to provide replication of large file repositories, for 
example to support high availability for servers. InterMezzo was deeply 
inspired by the Coda File System, but totally re-designed and re-engineered.</p>
<h3>15.4.2.8. WWWsync</h3> 
<p> WWWsync/ is a program written in Perl that will update your web pages by 
ftp from your local pages. This was originally written for updating Demon 
home-pages, but will work with other providers which provide direct FTP access 
to your web pages. I didn't check this for laptop purposes yet.</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.9. rsync</h3> 
<p> <b>rsync</b> is a program that allows files to be copied to and from 
remote machines in much the same way as<b>rcp</b>. It has many more options than
<b>rcp</b>, and uses the <em>rsync remote-update protocol</em> to greatly 
speedup file transfers when the destination file already exists. The<em>rsync 
remote-update protocol</em> allows <b>rsync</b> to transfer just the 
differences between two sets of files across the network link.</p> 
<h3>15.4.2.10. Xfiles - file tree synchronization and cross-validation</h3> 
<p> Xfiles is an interactive utility for comparing and merging one file tree 
with another over a network. It supports freeform work on several machines (no 
need to keep track of what files are changed on which machine). Xfiles can also 
be used as a cross-validating disk &lt;-&gt; disk backup strategy (portions of 
a disk may go bad at any time, with no simple indication of which files were 
affected. Cross-validate against a second disk before backup to make sure you 
aren't backing up bad data).</p> 
<p> A client/server program (GUI on the client) traverses a file tree and 
reports any files that are missing on the server machine, missing on the client 
machine, or different. For each such file, the file size/sizes and modification 
date(s) are shown, and a comparison (usingUNIX diff) can be obtained. For files 
that are missing from one tree,<em>similarly named</em> files in that tree are 
reported. Inconsistent files can then be copied in either direction or deleted 
on either machine. The file trees do not need to be accessible via nfs. Files 
checksums are computed in parallel, so largely similar trees can be compared 
over a slow network link. The client and server processes can also be run on 
the same machine. File selection and interaction with a revision control system 
such as RCS can be handled by scripting using jpython. Requirements Java1.1 or 
later and JFC/Swing1.1 are needed.Xfiles. </p> 
<h3>15.4.2.11. sitecopy</h3> 
<p> Sitecopy is for copying locally stored websites to remote web servers. The 
program will upload files to the server which have changed locally, and delete 
files from the server which have been removed locally, to keep the remote site 
synchronized with the local site, with a single command. The aim is to remove 
the hassle of uploading and deleting individual files using an FTP client.
sitecopy. </p> 
<h3>15.4.2.12. KBriefcase</h3> 
<p> The KDE tool Kbriefcase tries to achieve a similar goal as the Windows 
briefcase, but in a different way. Rather than pulling your files from the 
desktop, they are pushed to the laptop. You drag a file from the local location 
to the briefcase. You are then asked for the remote path to copy it to. It will 
then copy the file to the remote location and make the original read-only. When 
you restore and remove, the file is copied back and write permissions are given 
back. The read-only status, of course, makes sure you don't start editing the 
file again before you've brought your changes back from the remote location.</p>
<h2>15.4.3. DataConversion: AddressBooks, BookMarks, Todo-Lists, LDAP, Webpages
</h2> 
<p> Transfering user data from one mobile device to another one, often 
requires some tools to extract the data from the source device before importing 
them into the target device, for example if you want to change your favorite 
mobile phone. Or if you want to use the addressbook from your mobile with your 
PDA, too. Here are some tools forbookmark conversion, addressbook migration, 
vCard extraction, LDAP merging and data conversion for PDAs and HandHeld PCs. 
</p> 
<h1>15.5. Backup</h1> 
<p> To me data on mobile computers are even more likely to be damaged or lost 
than on desktop computers. So backups are even more important. There are 
different solutions for backups in mobile environments. I will describe them in 
one of the next issues.</p> 
<p> For backups on removable media like CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW you may boot from 
a Knoppix Live CD/DVD using the<b>toram</b> boot option. This way Knoppix will 
be completely loaded into RAM and you may remove the Knoppix CD/DVD from the 
drive to replace it with the backup media. Note: this will only work if your 
laptop provides more than 1GB RAM.</p> 
<h1>15.6. Connections to Servers</h1> 
<p> From Dirk Janssen &lt;dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu&gt;: Here are several good 
ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a 
separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a terminal 
server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and the better 
keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The easiest way to do 
this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from your desktop (running X) to 
the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure connection and, crucially, a secure X 
connection between the two machines. If you type, for example,<b>emacs &amp;</b>
 in the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while 
running on your laptop.</p> 
<p> There are various ways in which you can make this situation more 
productive/complicated. Emacs, for one thing, can open windows (called frames 
by emacs) on separate displays by using<b>make-frame-on-display</b>. This way, 
you can have the same emacs displaying on your desktop and your laptop: A dual 
headed system is born.</p> 
<p> For other programs, you usually have to decide at startup time on which 
screen you want them. To run them on the laptop screen, start them as usual. To 
run them on the desktop screen, start them from the ssh shell on the desktop or 
redirect their screens using the DISPLAY variable. Some programs also accept a
<b>-display</b> option. Read the documentation on <b>xauth</b> on how to set 
this up. An easy way out is to find out which pseudo display ssh has created 
for you by typing<b>echo $DISPLAY</b> in the ssh shell. Assuming your desktop 
is called<b>olli</b> and your laptop <b>stan</b>, this will usually produce 
something like<b>stan:10</b>. This means that processes on stan (the laptop) 
display on what they think is the 10th screen of stan, which by some ssh magic 
is actually relayed (in a secure way) to the screen of olli.</p> 
<p> There are some ways in which you can dynamically move windows from one 
machine to another. A very interesting approach is taken by<b>xmove</b>, but 
this program lacks a good user interface (any volunteers?). Xmove creates a 
pseudo screen (similar to the stan:10 that ssh creates) and windows that have 
their DISPLAY set to this pseudo screen can be moved back and forth between 
real screens (provided all screens use the same color depth).</p> 
<p> Alternatively, you can run an one of the several programs that open a <b>
virtual root window</b>: A window on your desktop that contains other windows. 
It looks a lot like running an emulator. With these programs, you can start 
your processes on stan, then move all their windows to olli, then work for a 
while, and then move them back so you can continue working on stan. Hibernate 
your laptop and repeat ad infinitum. Check out xmx and VNC for this.</p> 
<p> If this is all too complicated for you, but you like to use the two 
screens at the same time, consider at least installing x2x. This little tool 
makes it possible to move your mouse from one screen to the other, and the 
keyboard focus goes with it. To run it, you need another ssh going from stan 
(the laptop) to olli (the desktop): ie. type<b>ssh olli</b> in a stan xterm. 
Keep this shell running and find out which pseudo screen was created with<b>
echo $DISPLAY</b>. This will return something like <b>olli:10</b> (see above 
for explanation). Now, type this in any shell on olli:<b>x2x -west -to olli:10
</b> (and I mean, in a shell that runs on olli and displays on olli, not an ssh 
shell) This creates a little black band to on the left (west) side of your 
desktop's screen. Whenever you move the mouse over this, the mouse on screen 
olli:10 will move. Because olli:10 is just an ssh-created alias for the screen 
of stan, the mouse on your laptop will move and you can type there by only 
moving your head, not your hands.</p> 
<p> A note on X-security: Playing around with various screen programs is much 
easier if you issue an<b>xhost +</b> on either computer. But this is extremely 
unsafe. Do this only when you are not connected to any larger network. If you 
have everything working, spend some time on getting xauth to work. If you use 
xdm, it is usually easy. Otherwise, consider starting your Xserver with the 
same magic cookie all the time. This is less safe, but still pretty safe, and 
it means that you have to copy the cookies only once. Check the startup scripts 
(.xserverrc, .xinitrc, .xsession, etc) for something like<b>
cookie=&quot;MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 `keygen`&quot;</b> and change that into (invent 
your own cookie here):<b>cookie=&quot;MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 
12345678901234567890abcdefabcdef&quot;</b> </p>

Siemens Scenic Mobile 800. And some ACER models.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> User passwords: can be easily bypassed if the intruder gets physical 
access to your machine</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Hard Disk Passwords: </p></li> 
<li>
<p> BIOS passwords: are also easily crackable, though sometimes harder than 
with desktops. But how to do so is beyond the scope of this guide :) Some 
manufacturers have now a second boot password (IBM).</p>
<p> If you use a BIOS password/boot loader security, ADVERTISE IT! Paste a 
sticker (or tape a piece of paper) on the top of your laptop, saying something 
like:</p> 
<pre> WARNING This laptop is password protected. The password can only be 
removed by an authorized [manufacturer's name] technician presented with proof 
of ownership. So don't even think of stealing it, because it won't do you any 
good.</pre> <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Before you buy a second hand machine, check whether the machine seems to 
be stolen. I have provided a survey ofdatabases for stolen laptops. </p></li> 
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>15.8.2. Means to Protect the Hardware</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Laptop lock: Almost all (if not all) of the new laptops come with a slot 
for the lock, and if yours doesn't have one, most locks come with a kit to add 
a slot. One of Targus' Defcon locks even has a motion sensor, so you don't have 
to lock it up to a secure place, if you don't have one around.</p>
<p> The only drawback that I can think of is that it takes a couple extra 
seconds to set up or pack up your laptop. It takes about 30 seconds to snap 
into place and makes it impossible to quickly walk away with the laptop. It 
won't stop a determined thief with the time to unscrew the legs of the desk or 
one that wanders around with a substantial pair of wire cutters in hand, but I 
feel pretty secure leaving the laptop on my desk while I go to meetings or 
lunch.</p>
<p> Well known manufacturers of dedicated laptop locks are Kensignton and 
TARGUS.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Name plates: to reduce the possibility of theft, you may want to have a 
nameplate (name, phone, e-mail, address) made and affixed to the cover of the 
laptop. A nice one will cost you about $12, and can be made by any good trophy 
shop. They'll glue it on for you too. You could use double-sided tape instead, 
but glue is more permanent. So it's easy to return, but will look beaten and 
abused if these are removed. You may even make an engravement into the laptop 
cover (inside). And even better into every removable part (hard disk, battery, 
CD/DVD drive, power unit). If this machine ever gets to a repair office, I 
might get the machine back. Make sure you remember to update the plates if you 
move.</p>
<p> If you don't mind marking up a piece of equipment worth several thousand 
dollars, make sure your laptop has some distinguishing feature that is easily 
recognizable, e.g. a bunch of stickers pasted on it. Not only does it make your 
laptop easier to recognize, my guess is that people would be less likely to 
steal it.</p>
<p> It might even be useful to have a sticker that clearly says &quot;Does Not 
Run Windows&quot;. This is at least an argument for having your bootloader stop 
at the bootloader prompt, rather than mosey onwards into a colorful XDM login.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Link <b>xlock</b> to <b>apm</b> services. What about setting a system such 
as when the laptop is unused for a while, instead of using normal apm service 
and suspend the machine, makes it run an xlock, disable the apm services in a 
way such that they do not suspend the machine automatically and start a 
'laptop-protection daemon'. When the xlock disappears, the daemon is stopped 
and the apm services are restarted (so you might use the apm services yourself).
</p>
<p> In the case somebody unplugs the machine while under the xlock (without 
giving the password), then the daemon would detect it and could start doing 
some preventive action, such as: - playing a sound with maximum volume saying 
&quot;I am getting stolen&quot;. - this daemon could also register to a fixed 
local server and do a ping every now and then. If the ping stops before the 
daemon unregister to the server, then server then can take other actions, such 
as sending SMS message, starting a video camera, in the room, etc. The apm 
services down would make the stealer unable to use the hot keys to suspend/stop 
the machine, isn't it?</p></li> 
<li>
<p> You can change the &quot;pollution preventer&quot; logo at startup on 
AWARD BIOSES. See instructions fromSven Geggus. For IBM ThinkPads there is a 
dedicated DOS utility for burning your bizcard data into the BIOS boot screen.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Boot loader: a boot loader may be used to put your name and phone number 
(or whatever text you choose) into the boot sequence before the operating 
system is loaded. This provides a label that can't be removed by editing files 
or even doing a simple format of the harddisk. Some boot loaders (e.g. LILO) 
offer a password option, which is highly recommend (note without it's very easy 
to get root access).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Camouflage: if you carry a dedicated laptop bag, this can be spotted by a 
thief easily. So think about getting another kind of bag.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Serial Number: note the serial number in a secure place. This will be 
necessary if your laptop gets stolen.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Insurance: There are some dedicated insurances, see my page Database of 
Stolen Laptops. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Use of software that connects and identifies itself: As far as I know 
there was an old DOS utility that did something like this. It embedded itself 
into the bootsector and upon a certain keycombination it would throw a serial 
number onto the screen and play an audio code through the speaker (in case th 
monitor was no longer usable for whatever reason). You were supposed to 
register the serial number with the company that produced the utility.</p>
<p> The laptop can send a mail with its real IP address if connected (mail 
with a print of<b>ifconfig</b> started by /etc/ppp/ip-up or by a <b>cron</b> 
job (if connected at a company-network).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Always remove the external devices and secure them in another place/room. 
Set the BIOS to boot on the hard disk first as a default setting and remove 
boot on other devices if possible. Also try to plug the power supply in the 
least accessible plug. So if your machine get stolen in your office the 'quick 
way' (e.g. during a 5 sec. cigarette break), the stealer won't perhaps have 
time to get the power supply, neither the time to get the drives. Perhaps 
he/she will end up with a less useful laptop and you may recover it.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Electronic Devices (Transponders): There are also devices available, which 
can be detected remote via satellites, see my pageabout stolen laptops for a 
survey.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>15.8.3. The Day After</h2> 
<p> Your primary goal is to prevent your laptop from being stolen in the first 
place. Your secondary goal is to recover it after it is stolen. Report it to 
the police station ASAP. Check the local newsgroup (in case...) or even post in 
it.</p> 
<p> I have provided a survey of databases for stolen laptops. </p> 
<h2>15.8.4. Resources</h2> 
<p> The chapter about theft protection has taken some advantages of ideas of 
Lionel &quot;Trollhunter&quot; Bouchpan-Lerust-Juery and a discussion, which 
has taken place in thedebian-laptop mailing list in January 2001. </p> 
<h1>15.9. Dealing with Down Times (Cron Jobs)</h1> 
<p> A cron-like program that doesn't go by time: <b>anacron</b> (like 
&quot;anac(h)ronistic&quot;) is a periodic command scheduler. It executes 
commands at intervals specified in days. Unlike<b>cron</b>, it does not assume 
that the system is running continuously. It can therefore be used to control 
the execution of daily, weekly and monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n 
days), on systems that don't run 24 hours a day. When installed and configured 
properly,<b>anacron</b> will make sure that the commands are run at the 
specified intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.</p> 
<p> hc-cron is a modified version of Paul Vixie's widely used <b>cron</b> 
daemon. Like the original program it runs specified jobs at periodic intervals. 
However, the original<b>crond</b> relies on the computer running continuously, 
otherwise jobs will be missed. This problem is addressed by<b>hc-cron</b>, that 
is indended for use on<em>home-computers</em> that are typically turned off 
several times a day;<b>hc-cron</b> will remember the time when it was shut down 
and catch up jobs that have occurred during down time when it is started again.
</p> 
<h1>15.10. Mobile Printing</h1> 
<p> There are different techniques to print from mobile computers. You may use 
mobile printer hardware (see chapter Printers and Scanners above) or print via 
a stationary printer. To connect to a mobile or stationary printer or printer 
server you may use many protocols:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> InfraRed - IrLPT/IrCOMM: See the InfraRed-HOWTO. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> InfraRed - IrOBEX: See the InfraRed-HOWTO. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> BlueTooth: See the Bluetooth printing backend for CUPS At the moment this 
backend only provides native printing for Bluetooth serial port enabled 
printers, but for the future the support of Basic Printing (BPP) and Hardcopy 
Cable Replacement (HCRP) is planned.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> wireless network - WLAN </p></li> 
<li>
<p> network - LAN </p></li> 
<li>
<p> rlpr - remote line printer </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Server Message Block - SMB, via SAMBA </p></li> 
<li>
<p> parallel port </p></li> 
<li>
<p> serial port </p></li> 
<li>
<p> USB port </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h1>15.11. Noise Reduction</h1> 
<p> Due to the proliferation of cellular phones and walkmans it's not quite 
common in our days to take care of a quiet environment. Anyway I want to give 
some recommendations for the polite ones.</p> 
<p> Computer noises are caused by hardware (fan, optical drive, hard disk) and 
applications.</p> 
<h2>15.11.1. Console (Shell) and X11</h2> 
<p> The beeping of X11 windows can be configured to a shorter and lower 
pitched tone or even to a blunt &quot;thump&quot; with<b>xset b ...</b> options 
(a lower pitched tone is usually less annoying and distracting). Independently 
of that, most xterm-compatible windows and shells can be configured to make 
&quot;visual bell&quot; instead of &quot;audio bell&quot;. For the console<b>
setterm -blength 0</b> and for X11 <b>xset b off</b> turns the bell off. See 
also thePCMCIA-HOWTO and much more details in the Visible-Bell-Howto. </p> 
<h2>15.11.2. PCMCIA</h2> 
<p> When starting your laptop with PCMCIA-CS configured correctly, this will 
be shown by two high beeps. If you want to avoid this put<b>
CARDMGR_OPTS=&quot;-q&quot;</b> into the PCMCIA configuration file, e.g. 
/etc/default/pcmcia for Debian/GNU Linux. </p> 
<p> To avoid the dialtones during the modem dialing add </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> module &quot;serial_cs&quot; opts &quot;do_sound=0&quot; </pre> <br>
<br>
<p></p> 
<p> to /etc/pcmcia/config.opts (from <b>man serial_cs</b>). This will disable 
speaker output completely, but the<b>AT M</b> command should let you 
selectively control when the speaker is active, e.g.<b>AT M0</b> turns off the 
modem's speaker.</p> 
<h2>15.11.3. USB</h2> 
<p> <b>usbmgr</b> configuration file /etc/usbmgr.conf. </p> 
<pre> ### BEEP # beep off # beep on </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>15.11.4. Hotplug</h2> 
<p> Add an entry into the configuration file /etc/sysconfig/hotplug. </p> 
<pre> HOTPLUG_BEEP=&quot;no&quot; </pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>15.11.5. Fan</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p> Please make sure what you are doing, when configuring the fan. Your laptop 
may overheat and die, in case you have done something wrong. Just in case you 
want to check the fan try to cause a heavy CPU load, for example by issueing<b>
md5sum /dev/urandom</b>. Now <b>top</b> will show an increased CPU load and the 
fan should began to run eventually. Note: usually you need to have been 
connected to power, otherwise the CPU might reduce load by itself. Also watch 
for the CPU temperature<b>acpi -bt</b> or <b>cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/*</b>. 
</p> <br>
<br>

<p> For some laptop series there are Linux utilities available to control the 
fan and other features.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Toshutils by Jonathan Buzzard for some Toshiba models. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> tpctl IBM ThinkPad configuration tools for Linux by Thomas Hood. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> i8k utils for DELL laptops. </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h3>15.11.5.1. Known Problems</h3> 
<p> With some laptops the fan is always on or at least very often. Here are 
some remedies.</p> 
<h4>15.11.5.1.1. Reduction of CPU Frequency</h4> 
<p> In some cases the fan is always on because the CPU is working with highest 
frequency. You may use eithercpufreqd or cpudyn to cure this. </p> 
<h4>15.11.5.1.2. IRQ Problems with ParPort Module</h4> 
<p> Sometimes the parport causes the fan to be always on. You may edit the 
/etc/modules.conf to cure this: </p> 
<pre> alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc options parport_pc io=378 irq=7 </pre> 
<br> <br>
 The IO address and the IRQ number depend on the hardware settings or 
the BIOS configuration. Often the IRQ does not need to be given. The problem 
and its solution was discussed in theSuSE Laptop Mailing List. 
<p></p> 
<h4>15.11.5.1.3. ACPI</h4> 
<p> Sometimes a setting in the /proc/acpi/ might also help. </p> 
<h4>15.11.5.1.4. Miscellaneous</h4> 
<p> Pressing the Fn+z key kombination tells the BIOS to recheck the sensors 
and stops the fan, for DELL laptops.</p> 
<h2>15.11.6. Harddisk</h2> 
<p> To avoid unnecessary hard disk noise you may use the same techniques as 
described in the power saving chapter above. Modern laptop and notebook hard 
drives come with a so-called &quot;Acoustic Management&quot;, just have a look 
into the manual to get an overview about the possible settings.</p> 
<p> Some hard disk manufacturers offer dedicated tools, e.g. Hitachi's Feature 
Tool allows to change the drive Automatic Acoustic Management settings to the 
Lowest acoustic emanation setting (Quiet Seek Mode), or Maximum performance 
level (Normal Seek Mode). Also<b>hdparm -M</b> offers some Acoustic Management 
options.</p> 
<h2>15.11.7. Miscellaneous Applications</h2> 
<p> You may configure <b>vi</b> with the <b>flash</b> option, so it will use a 
flash in case of an error, instead of a bell. So just put this line into your
.vimrc or at the <b>vim</b> prompt: </p> 
<pre> set flash </pre> <br>
<br>
 or try 
<pre> set visualbell </pre> <br>
<br>

<h1>Chapter 16. Solutions with Mobile Computers</h1> 
<h1>16.1. Introduction</h1> 
<p> The power and capabilities of laptops and PDAs are sometimes limited as 
described above. But in turn, they have a feature which desktops don't have 
their mobility. I try to give a survey about applications which make sense in 
connection with mobile computers.</p> 
<h1>16.2. Mobile Network Analyzer</h1> 
<p> I'm not an expert in this field, so I just mention the tools I know. 
Please check also for other applications. Besides the usual tools<b>tcpdump</b>,
<b>netcat</b>, there are two applications I prefer, which may be used to 
analyze network traffic:</p> 
<p> The Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) is a tool to monitor the traffic 
load on network-links. MRTG generates HTML pages containing GIF images which 
provide a LIVE visual representation of this traffic. MRTG is based on Perl and 
C and works underUNIX and Windows NT. </p> 
<p> Network Top - ntop is a UNIX tool that shows the network usage, similar to 
what the popular topUNIX command does. <b>ntop</b> is based on <b>libpcap</b> 
and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on everyUNIX
 platform and on Win32 as well.<b>ntop</b> can be used in both interactive or 
web mode. In the first case,<b>ntop</b> displays the network status on the 
user's terminal. In web mode a web browser (e.g. netscape) can attach to<b>ntop
</b> (that acts as a web server) and get a dump of the network status. In the 
latter case,<b>ntop</b> can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an 
embedded web interface.</p> 
<h1>16.3. Mobile Router</h1> 
<p> Though designed to work from a single floppy, the <em>Linux Router Project 
(LRP)</em>, seems useful in combination with a laptop, too. </p> 
<h1>16.4. Hacking and Cracking Networks</h1> 
<p> When thinking about the powers of laptops, hacking and cracking networks 
may come into mind. I don't want to handle this topic here, but instead 
recommend theSecurity-HOWTO . </p> 
<h1>16.5. Mobile Data Collection</h1>

<h2>16.5.2. Applications</h2> 
<p> A Linux laptop can be used to collect data outside an office, e.g. geodesy 
data, sales data, network checks, patient data in a hospital and others. There 
is support for wireless data connections via cellular phone modems and amateur 
radio. I am not sure whetherPCMCIA radio cards are supported, see Aironet 
Wireless Communications. </p> 
<h2>16.5.3. Specific Environments</h2> 
<p> There are laptops available with cases build for a rugged environment 
(even waterproof laptops). In some environments, for instance in hospitals, 
take care of the Electro-Magnetic-Compatibility of the laptop. This is 
influenced by many factors, for instance by the material used to build the 
case. Usually magnesium cases shield better than the ones made of plastics.</p> 
<h1>16.6. Mobile Office</h1> 
<p> With KDE (K-Office), Gnome and the commercial products WordPerfect, 
Staroffice andApplixware Linux has more and more business software 
applications. With the corresponding hardware, e.g. a portable printer and a 
cellular phone which connects to your laptop, you will have a very nice mobile 
office.</p> 
<h1>16.7. Connection to Digital Camera</h1> 
<p> AFAIK there are currently three methods to connect a digital camera to a 
laptop: the infrared port (IrDA&reg;), serial port and maybe USB. There are 
also some auxiliary programs for conversion of pictures, etc.</p> 
<p> Eric &lt;dago_AT_tkg.att.ne.jp&gt; wrote: &quot;I finally succeeded in 
downloading pictures from my digital camera, but not exactly the way I 
expected, i.e. not throughUSB port but using PCMCIA card port and memory stick 
device, part of digital camera hardware. Anyway, some interesting things to 
mention:</p> 
<p> Sony (pretending using a standard) uses the msdos format to store images 
as JPEG files ; so the best way to have your OS recognizing them is to mount 
the raw device like a msdos filesystem; using mount directly doesn't work 
(don't know why) but an entry in the /etc/fstab file allows you to mount the 
device correctly. i.e.:</p> 
<pre> /dev/hde1 /mnt/camera msdos user,noauto,ro 0 0 </pre> <br>
<br>
 Of 
course,<b>newfs</b> before <b>mount</b> works too, but there is nothing to see 
at all ;-) I think both<b>noauto</b> and <b>ro</b> are important flags; I tried 
without it and it didn't work. Somehow the mount I got seems buggy . And if<b>ro
</b> is missing, the camera doesn't recognize back the memory stick and it 
needs to be msdos-formatted.
<p></p> 
<p> Appropriate to the camera documentation , both PCMCIA and USB port behave 
the same (for Mac and Windoze - i.e. you see a file system auto mounted) - I 
deduce for Linux it should be the same thing too, as long as theUSB driver is 
installed. I think now that mountingUSB raw device the way I did with PCMCIA 
should work, but I still couldn't find which device to use.&quot;</p> 
<p> OpenDiS (Open Digita Support) is a library and utility program for cameras 
such as the Kodak DC-220, DC-260, DC-265, and DC-280, that run Flashpoint's 
Digita operating system. The library is a unix implementation of the Digita 
Host Interface Specification, intended for embedding Digita support in other 
products such as<b>gPhoto</b>. The utility is a simple command-line program for 
standalone downloading of photos from the cameras.</p> 
<p> gPhoto enables you to take a photo from any digital camera, load it onto 
your PC running a free operating system like GNU/Linux, print it, email it, put 
it on your web site, save it on your storage media in popular graphics formats 
or just view it on your monitor.<b>gPhoto</b> sports a new HTML engine that 
allows the creation of gallery themes (HTML templates with special tags) making 
publishing images to the world wide web a snap. A directory browse mode is 
implemented making it easy to create an HTML gallery from images already on 
your computer. Support for the Canon PowerShot A50, Kodak DC-240/280 USB, and 
Mustek MDC-800 digital cameras.</p> 
<p> photopc is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate digital 
still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Siarra Imaging firmware. The program 
is known to work with Agfa, Epson and Olympus cameras. Should also work with 
Sanyo, but this is untested. The cameras typically come with software for 
Windows and for Mac, and no description of the protocol. With this tool, they 
are manageable from aUNIX box. Bruce D. Lightner 
&lt;lightner_AT_metaflow.com&gt; has added support for Win32 and DOS platforms. 
Note that the program does not have any GUI, it is plain command-line even on 
Windows. For a GUI, check out the<b>phototk</b> program. </p> 
<p> DC20 is a user friendly package for the Kodak DC20 camera. It consists of 
two programs, a low-level driver for manipulating the camera from the command 
line and a TCL/Tk front-end which uses the driver. You can use the internal 
viewer, or choose any standard external viewer.</p> 
<p> kdc2tiff is software to convert .kdc images from Kodak's DC120 digital 
camera to .tiff or .jpg files. This software pays particular attention to 
aspect ratio, high quality scaling, contrast adjustment, gamma correction, and 
image rotation.</p> 
<p> rdc2e is a command line tool that downloads images from a Ricoh RDC-2E 
digital camera. It is available as either a source tar ball or a RedHat 6.1 
i386 RPM.</p> 
<p> fujiplay Interface for Fuji digital cameras. </p> 
<h1>16.8. Connection to QuickCam (Video)</h1> 
<p> AFAIK there are three methods to connect a video camera to a laptop: a ZV 
port, FireWire and maybe USB, but I don't know how this works with Linux. I 
have heard rumors about using a sound card for video data transfer to a Linux 
box, seeapenwarr . I have heard rumors about a Linux-QuickCam-mini-HOWTO, but 
couldn't find a reliable URL yet. Check the<b>sane</b> package which is build 
for scanner support, this should contain support for still-grabbers as well.</p>
<p> kmc_remote provides a graphical interface for controlling Kodak Motion 
Corder fast digital cameras over a serial connection. kmc_remote is built on 
the kmc_serial library, part of the kmc_utils package. kmc_remote provides a 
virtual button panel and simple one-touch commands for changing system 
variables which would involve multiple button operations on the real camera 
button console. Buttons, record settings (image size, record rate, shutter 
speed, trigger mode, burst mode), and playback rate control should be fully 
functional. All camera models are supported, as well as both PAL and NTSC video.
</p> 
<p> Intel PC Camera Pro Pack is one of the first webcams with USB ports. Also 
SONY has announced a webcam withUSB port. See a survey at Steve's Digicams . 
</p> 
<h1>16.9. Connection to Television Set</h1> 
<p> If you have a ZV port in the laptop, it should be easy to connect it to a 
TV set, using either NSCA or PAL, but I don't know whether either works with 
Linux.</p> 
<h1>16.10. Connection to Cellular Phone</h1> 
<p> AFAIK there are two methods to connect a cellular phone to a laptop: via 
the<em>infrared port</em> (IrDA&reg;) or via the <em>serial port</em>. See the 
Linux/IrDA&reg; project for the current status of IrDA&reg; connections. As far 
as I know only the Ericsson SH888, the Nokia 8110 and the Siemens S25 provide 
infrared support.</p> 
<h1>16.11. Connection to Global Positioning System (GPS)</h1> 
<p> From the Hardware-HOWTO I know there is <em>Trimble Mobile GPS</em> 
available for Linux. You may also connect a GPS via a serial port. Most GPS 
receivers have a data port and can connect to a PC with a special serial cable.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<p> Differential GPS is a technique to apply a correction factor from a known 
location to a GPS signal. This can substantially reduce the uncertainity in the 
GPS location. Normally the correction signal is acquired using a special radio 
receiver:<b>dgpsip</b> allows you to receive a DGPS signal via TCP/IP, and send 
it to the GPS connected to your serial port.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> DGPS is a project to put together a low cost hardware and software 
solution for Differential GPS (in both real time mode using RTCM correction 
format and in post processed mode).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and translates 
the positional data to simplified format that can be more easily used by other 
programs, like chart plotters. The package comes with a sample client that 
plots the location of the currently visible GPS satellites (if available) and a 
speedometer. Added support for the DeLame EarthMate as well as a new 
'speedometer' mini client.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> The QtGPS package contains a piece of software for UNIX/Linux/X and a GPS 
receiver. It performs logging and replaying of a journey, supporting a 
moving-map display. QtGPS works with Lat/Long and British OSGB (Ornance Survey) 
co-ordinate systems.</p></li>

<p> gps3d is a set of utilities that lets you manipulate your GPS from your 
Linux box. One nice feature is the ability to view GPS data (track, waypoints, 
fix, etc.) on an OpenGL, 3D texture-mapped model of earth.</p></li> </ul>

<h1>16.12. Connection via Amateur Radio (HAM)</h1> 
<p> As far as I know laptops are used in amateur radio contests. Please see 
HAM-HOWTO by Terry Dawson,<em>VK2KTJ</em>, 
&lt;terry_AT_perf.no.itg.telstra.com.au&gt;.</p> 
<p> XASTIR is a free APRS (Automatic Position Reporting System) program. 
APRS(tm) was developed to track mobile GPS stations with two-way radio to 
convey position reports, messaging, weather and more. XASTIR plots this 
information on a map on your screen where you can see the entire world or zoom 
down to street level.</p> 
<h1>16.13. Satellite Watching</h1> 
<p> Together with an antenna and software like <b>seesat</b> or <b>sattrack</b>
 you can use a laptop to locate a satellite for visual observation. You could 
also use<b>xephem</b> on a laptop when stargazing. See also the Astronomy-HOWTO 
.</p> 
<h1>16.14. Aviation</h1> 
<p> Many people are using laptops for aviation related topics. The Aviation 
HOWTO provides pointers to software packages that run under the Linux operating 
system and are useful to private, commercial, or military pilots. The ultimate 
goal is to enable pilots to use the Linux operating system for all their 
aviation related computing needs.</p> 
<h1>16.15. Blind or Visually Impaired Users</h1> 
<p> There are some groups of which could gain a specific profit by using 
laptops. For instance blind or visually impaired people (I explicitly avoid to 
say handicapped people). SeeAccessibility-HOWTO and Blinux - Linux for blind 
people for more information. <b>brltty</b> is a program which supports 
different braille terminals.<b>Festival</b> is a speech synthesis system. 
Screen and cursor magnifiers are available. See TuxMobil for asmall survey of 
laptop installation reports by or for blind people. </p>

<h1>Appendix A. Other Operating Systems</h1> 
<h1>A.1. Microsoft DOS and Windows</h1> 
<h2>A.1.1. Introduction</h2> 
<p> There are a few reasons which might make it necessary to put Micorosoft 
DOS/Windows and Linux together on one laptop. Often the support for the flash 
ROM ofPCMCIA cards and modems is not available for Linux, or you have to 
retrieve hardware information, which is not visible with Linux, due to a lack 
of support by some hardware manufacturers. I'm not sure whether these tasks can 
be performed under an emulation like DOS-EMU, WINE or VMware.</p> 
<p> If you want Linux with X11, Netscape, etc., and 
Microsoft-Windows9x,NT,2000,XP things will be tight in a 1GB harddisk. Though I 
did so with a 810MB disk.</p> 
<h2>A.1.2. DOS Tools to Repartition a Hard Disk</h2> 
<p> Often you get a preinstalled version of Microsoft-Windows on your laptop. 
If you just want to shrink the Windows partition, you need a tool to resize the 
partition. Or you can remove the partition first, repartition, then reinstall. 
Most of the following information I found at the page ofMichael Egan 
&lt;Michael.Egan_AT_sonoma.edu&gt;.</p> 
<p> A well known and reliable commercial product is Partition Magic from Power 
Quest.</p> 
<p> BootitNG is a shareware programm, which is capable of resizing NTFS, EXT2, 
EXT3 and ReiserFS partitions.</p> 
<p> <b>System Commander 2000</b> by Symantec? resizes FAT32 partitions, unlike 
Partition Magic, SC2000 seems to be able to work without the presence of an 
installed Microsoft operating system (tough you may use Partition Magic from 
two standalone floppy disks).</p> 
<p> One more &quot;newer&quot; utility for repartitioning and resizing FAT 
partitions is<em>Ranish Partition Manager/Utility</em> (FAT-32 support is 
claimed for this as well, Linux support is taken into account.)Ranish Partition 
Manager/Utility . </p> 
<p> Many people have used <em>FIPS 15c</em> (which may support FAT-32) FIPS 
for repartitioning FAT partition sizes.) Also, another version from a different 
source is FIPS 2.0 (claims to support FAT-32)FIPS 2.0 for repartitioning FAT 
partition sizes.)</p> 
<h2>A.1.3. Partition Sharing</h2> 
<p> You may share your swap space between Linux and Windows. Please see 
&quot;Dealing with Limited Resources&quot; section.</p> 
<p> With Linux you can mount any kind of DOS/Windows partition of the type <b>
msdos</b>, <b>vfat</b> and even compressed drives (Drivespace, etc.). For long 
file names use<b>vfat</b> and if you like autoconversion ( a nice feature for 
text files), you may do so by using the<b>conv=auto</b> option. I have used 
this in my/etc/fstab, but be aware this might cause some strange behaviour 
sometimes, look at the kernel docs for further details.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> /dev/hda8 /dos/d vfat user,exec,nosuid,nodev,conv=auto 0 2 </pre> <br>

<br> 
<p></p> 
<p> The other way round there are also some tools, which provide a means to 
read and write ext2 partitions from Windows9x/NT.</p> 
<p> LREAD is a tool suite for Windows 9x and Windows NT (or DOS or Windows 3.x 
for those who still have it) for accessing files on Linux harddisks (Linux's 
native Extended 2 filesystem).</p> 
<p> The tools allow to list directories, to copy files from Linux to DOS and 
to copy files from DOS to Linux. You also can delete files or modify access 
rights of Linux files from DOS/Windows.</p> 
<p> In combination with an included simple server program, you can also access 
your files from a remote client over the net (however, this might be a security 
risk, as access protection in this case is rather simple).</p> 
<h3>A.1.3.1. LINE Is Not an Emulator</h3> 
<p> LINE executes unmodified Linux applications on Windows by intercepting 
Linux system calls. The Linux applications themselves are not emulated. They 
run directly on the CPU just like all other Windows applications.</p> 
<h2>A.1.4. Installation without CD Drive</h2> 
<p> You may use the CD drive of a desktop (or copy the content of the CD to 
the hard disk) and connect both machines with a null modem cable. Then use a 
DOS boot floppy and the program<b>INTERLNK.EXE</b> to connect both machines. 
</p> 
<h2>A.1.5. Miscellaneous</h2> 
<p> TravSoft </p> 
<p> Windows/NT offers: RAS - Remote Access Service </p> 
<p> Windows/9x/NT offers the PPTP protocol to connect to remote sites via a 
TCP/IP tunnel. This protocol is also supported by Linux.PoPToP is the PPTP 
server solution for Linux allowing Linux servers to function seamlessly in the 
PPTP VPN environment. This enables administrators to leverage the considerable 
benefits of both Microsoft clients and Linux servers. The current pre-release 
version supports Windows 95/98/NT PPTP clients and PPTP Linux clients. The 
PoPToP pre-release server is not yet fully optimised. On release, PoPToP will 
be fully compliant with IETF PPTP Internet Draft and it will seamlessly support 
Windows PPTP clients with the full range of encryption and authentication 
features.</p> 
<h1>A.2. BSD UNIX</h1> 
<p> FreeBSD is a version of the UNIX operating system that runs on PC 
hardware. It uses a different set of support forPCMCIA devices, APM, and other 
mobility related issues.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> PicoBSD is a one floppy version of FreeBSD 3.0-current, which in its 
different variations allows you to have secure dialup access, small diskless 
router or even a dial-in server. And all this on only one standard 1.44MB 
floppy. It runs on a minimum 386SX CPU with 8MB of RAM (no HDD required!). You 
probably may also use it to install BSD on a laptop as described with micro 
Linuxes above.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> PAO: FreeBSD Mobile Computing Package </p></li> 
<li>
<p> The CMU Monarch Project offers implementations of Mobile-IPv4 and 
Mobile-IPv6 for FreeBSD.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> XF86Config Archive . A database of XF86Config files used by Linux and 
FreeBSD users. If you need an XF86Config file for your notebook or laptop, 
check out this site. (Some documents available in Japanese only.)</p></li> 
<li>
<p> AFAIK there is no IrDA&reg; support yet. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Archive of the FreeBSD-Mobile mailing list . Sorry don't know how to 
subscribe yet.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Laptop Survey / FreeBSD - LTS is a project to collect information of 
laptop and NOTE-PC environments running FreeBSD. It provides information in 
English and Japanese. Please support this project.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h1>A.3. OS/2</h1> 
<p> At The Notebook/2 Site by Dr. Martinus you may find information about 
different notebooks andPCMCIA cards working with OS/2. </p> 
<h1>A.4. NOVELL Netware</h1> 
<p> The client side with DOS/Windows9x style operating systems seems to be no 
problem, since there are manyPCMCIA cards with drivers for Netware available. 
For Linux connections see the<b>mars_nwe</b> package. Also the Caldera Linux 
distribtion is well known for its Novell support.</p> 
<p> I hadn't time to build a Netware server on a laptop yet and couldn't check 
whether there are network connections possible (PCMCIA driver for Netware 
server).</p> 
<h1>A.5. Debian GNU/Hurd (hurd-i386)</h1> 
<p> The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by the 
GNU group. In fact, the GNU Hurd is the final component which makes it possible 
to built an entirely GNU OS -- and Debian GNU/Hurd is going to be one such 
(possibly even the first) GNU OS. The current project is founded on the i386 
architecture, but expect the others to follow soon.</p> 
<p> The GNU Hurd Hardware Compatibility Guide states that Hurd should work on 
laptops, butPCMCIA support isn't ready yet. </p> 
<h1>Appendix B. Other Resources</h1> 
<h1>B.1. Main WWW Resources</h1> 
<p> Kenneth E. Harker maintains a quite valuable database at Linux on Laptops 
. Please have a look at his site to get current information about laptop 
related mailing lists, newsgroups, magazines and newsletters, WWW sites and a 
big and up-to-date database about many different laptop pages.</p> 
<p> The author of this guide maintains the TuxMobil Linux Laptop and Notebook 
Installation Survey and a Linux compatibility database about different laptop, 
notebook and PDA hardware, such asPCMCIA/CardBus/CF-Cards, graphics cards, 
sound chips, IrDA devices, and more. </p>

<h1>B.6. General Laptop Information</h1> 
<p> These are sources of information of general use to laptop and notebook 
owners, regardless of the operating system used.</p> 
<p> Laptop Soup This site offers a lot of information about what companies 
produce which machines sold under which brand names. If you need to know what 
company made your machine, this site may help you find out.</p> 
<p> The WWW Virtual Library: Mobile and Wireless Computing This site provides 
a world of information about scientific journals, conferences, academic 
projects, and more that relate to state-of-the-art mobile computing. There are 
also many references to developing standards, non-profit and governmental 
organizations, and an index of vendors, including wireless service providers.
</p> 
<p> Federal Communications Commission On-line Equipment Authorization Database 
If you are having problems identifying the manufacturer of a laptop or notebook 
computer (or other electronic device,) this site lets you search the FCC 
database based on the FCC ID number you can usually find on the equipment if it 
was marketed in the United States of America.</p> 
<h1>Appendix C. Repairing the Hardware</h1> 
<p> There are several different reasons that could make it necessary to open 
the case of a laptop, notebook or PDA.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> repair broken hardware </p></li> 
<li>
<p> get some hardware info, which isn't available otherwise, e.g. reading the 
sticker on an undetected chipset</p></li> 
<li>
<p> remove the speakers (speakerektomy, as described in Visual-Bell-HOWTO ) 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> install overdrive for CPU </p></li> 
<li>
<p> reflash the BIOS </p></li> 
<li>
<p> change BIOS battery </p></li> 
<li>
<p> upgrade harddisk </p></li> 
<li>
<p> upgrade memory </p></li> 
<li>
<p> implement additional hardware, e.g. an internal wireless LAN miniPCI card 
</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> Repairing a laptop can be quite expensive if you don't have a 
manufacturer's warranty. Sometimes professional support is bad. But opening a 
laptop case can be difficult. Often the procedures to upgrade the memory and 
the harddisk are described in the manual. For further details, you should try 
to get the maintenance/technical manual. Just be extremely careful and make 
notes as to where each screw goes. You must get most of them back in the right 
hole or you could ruin the machine by damaging the system board. Also after you 
get all the screws to an assembly out (some will be hidden) the parts are 
usually held together with plastic clips molded in, so you still must exercise 
care to separate them. Sometimes you need certain tools, for instance TORX 
screw drivers or a solder kit. Good luck.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Usually laptop and PDA manufacturers declare the warranty to be void if 
the case was opened by people other than their own staff. If you want to try it 
anyway you may find some interesting links about how torepair, disassemble, 
upgrade or mod laptops or notebooks, dissect, repair and upgrade broken PDAs 
and HandHelds, as well as take apart, repair and upgrade mobile (cell) phones, 
open, repair and upgrade mobile audio and video players and repair and upgrade 
printers. </p> <br>

<h1>Appendix D. Survey about Micro Linuxes</h1> 
<p> Because of their small or non-existent footprint, micro-Linuxes are 
especially suited to run on laptops - particularly if you use a 
company-provided laptop running Microsoft-Windows9x/NT. Or for installation 
purposes using another non Linux machine. There are several<em>micro</em> Linux 
distributions out there that boot from one or two floppies or CD/DVD.</p> 
<p> See LinuxHQ or Tinux for details. You may find a FAQ and a mailing list 
about boot-floppies atBoot-Floppies-FAQ . Also a BootDisk-HOWTO is available. 
Thanks to Matthew D. Franz maintainer of<em>Trinux</em> for this tips and 
collecting most of the following URLs. See also the content of Console/Mini 
Distributions atFreshMeat . </p>

<p> Knoppix by Klaus Knopper is a bootable CD with a collection of GNU/Linux 
software, automatic hardware detection, and support for many graphics cards, 
sound cards, SCSI and USB devices and other peripherals. KNOPPIX can be used as 
a Linux demo, educational CD, rescue system, or adapted and used as a platform 
for commercial software product demos. It is not necessary to install anything 
on a hard disk. Due to on-the-fly decompression, the CD can have up to 2 GB of 
executable software installed on it. A kix (Knoppix mini CD) is now available 
in the contrib directory.</p></li>

<p> Lightweight Linux, Part 1: Hardware is only as old as the software it 
runs: a modern operating system and up-to-date applications return an older 
system to productivity. This article provides best practices and step-by-step 
guidance on how to build a working Linux system on older hardware or on modern 
hardware with limited memory and storage.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h1>E.2. Introduction</h1> 
<p> As mentioned in the introduction laptops sometimes have less resources if 
you compare them to desktops. To deal with limited space, memory, CPU speed and 
battery power, I have written this chapter.</p> 
<h1>E.3. Small Space</h1> 
<h2>E.3.1. Introduction</h2> 
<p> There are different types of techniques to gain more disk space, such as 
sharing of space, freeing unused or redundant space, filesystem tuning and 
compression. Note: some of these techniques use memory instead of disk space. 
As you will see, there are many small steps necessary to free some space.</p> 
<h2>E.3.2. Techniques</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Stripping: Though many distributions come with stripped binaries today it 
is useful to check this. For details see<b>man strip</b>. To find every 
unstripped file you can use the<b>file</b> command or more convenient the tool 
<b>findstrip</b>. Attention: don't strip libraries, sometimes the wrong symbols 
are removed due to a bad programming technique. Or use the<b>--strip-unneeded
</b> option. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Perforation: <b>zum(1)</b> reads a file list on stdin and attempts to 
perforate these files. Perforation means, that series of null bytes are 
replaced by<b>lseek</b>, thus giving the file system a chance of not allocating 
real disk space for those bytes. Example:<b>find . -type f | xargs zum</b> </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Remove Odd Files and Duplicates: Check your system for core files, emacs 
recovery files &lt;#FILE#&gt; vi recovery files &lt;FILE&gt;.swp, RPM recovery 
files &lt;FILE&gt;.rpmorig and<b>patch</b> recovery files. Find duplicates, you 
may try<b>finddup</b>. Choose a system to name your backup, temporary and test 
files, e.g. with a signature at the end.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Clean Temporary Files: , e.g. /tmp, there is even a tool <b>tmpwatch</b>. 
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Shorten the Log Files: usually the files in /var/log. You may use <b>
logrotate</b> to achieve this task. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Remove Files: Remove files which are not &quot;necessary&quot; under all 
circumstances such as man pages, documentation/usr/doc and sources e.g. /usr/src
 .</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Unnecessary Libraries: You may use the <b>binstats</b> package to find 
unused libraries (Thanks to Tom Ed White).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Filesystem: Choose a filesystem which treats disk space economically e.g. 
<b>rsfs</b>. Tune your filesystem e.g. <b>tune2fs</b>. Choose an appropriate 
partition and block size.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Reduce Kernel Size: Either by using only the necessary kernel features 
and/or making a compressed kernel image<b>bzImage</b>. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Compression: I didn't check this but as far as I know you may compress 
your filesystem with<b>gzip</b> and decompress it on the fly. Alternatively you 
may choose to compress only certain files. You can even execute compressed 
files with<b>zexec</b> </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Compressed Filesystems: - For e2fs filesystems there is a compression 
version availablee2compr. </p>
<p> - DMSDOS which enables your machine to access Windows95 compressed drives 
(drivespace, doublestacker). If you don't need DOS/Windows95 compatibility, 
i.e. if you want to compress Linux-only data, this is really discouraged by the 
author of the program. Seedmsdos . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Partition Sharing: You may share swap-space (see Swap-Space-HOWTO) or data 
partitions between different OS (see<b>mount</b>). For mounting MS-DOS 
Windows95 compressed drives (doublespace, drivespace) you may use<b>dmsdos</b> 
dosfs/ . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Libraries: Take another (older) library, for instance <b>libc5</b> , this 
library seems to be smaller than<b>libc6</b> also known as <b>glibc2</b> . </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Kernel: If your needs are fitted with an older kernel version, you can 
save some space.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> GUI: Avoid as much Graphical User Interface (GUI) as possible. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Tiny Distributions: There are some distributions available which fit from 
one 3.5&quot; floppy to 10MB disk space and fit for small memories, too. See
Appendix A Appendix D and below. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> External Storage Devices (Hard Disks, ZIP Drives, NFS, SAMBA): Since many 
notebooks may be limited in their expandability, using the parallel port is an 
attractive option. There are external hard disks and ZIP Drives available. 
Usually they are also connectable viaPCMCIA. Another way is using the resources 
of another machine through NFS or SAMBA etc.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Purging of uneeded locales: <b>localepurge</b> for Debian is just a simple 
script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locale files and localized man 
pages. Depending on your installation, it is possible to save some 200, 300, or 
even more megabytes of disk space usually dedicated for locales you'll probably 
never have any usage for.</p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h1>E.4. Hard Disk Speed</h1> 
<p> Use the tool <b>hdparm</b> to set up better harddisk performance. Though I 
have seen laptop disk enabled with<em>striping</em>, I can't see a reason to do 
so, because in my humble opinion also known as RAID0 striping needs at least 
two different disks to increase performance. Before using<b>hdparm</b> check 
the BIOS settings for harddisk parameters like DMA or ATA4 or 32bit transfer. 
The bad thing is that if something is disabled there - it can not be enabled 
with<b>hdparm</b>! </p> 
<p> See UNIX and LINUX Computing Journal: Tunable Filesystem Parameters in 
/proc How to increase, decrease and reconfigure filsystem behavior from within 
/proc. </p>

<p></p> 
<h2>E.5.2. Techniques</h2> 
<p> Check the memory usage with <b>free</b> and <b>top</b>. </p> 
<p> Mergemem Project . Many programs contain <em>memory areas of the same 
content</em> that remain undetected by the operating system. Typically, these 
areas contain data that have been generated on startup and remain unchanged for 
longer periods. With<b>mergemem</b> such areas are detected and shared. The 
sharing is performed on the operating system level and is invisible to the user 
level programs.<b>mergemem</b> is particularily useful if you run many 
instances of interpreters and emulators (like Java or Prolog) that keep their 
code in private data areas. But also other programs can take advantage albeit 
to a lesser degree.</p> 
<p> You may also reduce the <em>kernel size</em> as much as possible by 
removing any feature which is not necessary for your needs and by modularizing 
the kernel as much as possible.</p> 
<p> Also you may shutdown every service or <em>daemon</em> which is not 
needed, e.g.<b>lpd</b>, <b>mountd</b>, <b>nfsd</b> and close some <em>virtual 
consoles</em>. Please see Small-Memory-HOWTO for details. </p> 
<p> And of course use <em>swap space</em>, when possible. </p> 
<p> If possible you use the resources of another machine, for instance with 
X11, VNC or even<b>telnet</b>. For more information on Virtual Network 
Computing (VNC), seeVNC. </p> 
<h1>E.6. Low CPU Speed</h1> 
<p> You may want to overdrive the CPU speed but this can damage your hardware 
and I don't have experience with it. For some examples look atAdorable Toshiba 
Libretto - Overclocking. </p> 
<h1>E.7. Power Saving Techniques</h1> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> If you don't need infrared support, disable it in the BIOS or shutdown the 
IrDA&reg; device driver. There are also some IrDA&reg; features of the kernel 
which are useful for saving power.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> PCMCIA services consume much power, so shut them down if you don't need 
them.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> I'm not sure to which extend the <em>backlight</em> consumes power. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> As far as I know this device can only bear a limited number of uptime 
circles. So avoid using screensavers, which turn off the backlight.</p> <br>

<br> 
<p> If you want do it anyhow, you may use <b>xset +dpms</b> and <b>xset dpms 0 
0 300</b> This turns the screen off after 5 minutes of inactivity. Works only 
if the display is DPMS capable.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> For some examples to build batteries with increased uptime up to 8 hours 
look atRepair4Laptop: Battery . </p></li> 
<li>
<p> For information about APM look at the chapter APM above. </p></li> 
<li>
<p> The &quot;noatime&quot; option when mouting filesystems tells the kernel to
<em>not</em> update the <em>access time</em> information of the file. This 
information, although sometimes useful, is not used by most people. Therefore, 
you can safely disable it, then preventing disk access each time you<b>cat</b> 
a file. Here is an example of a/etc/fstab with this power-saving option: <b> 
/dev/hda7 /var ext2 defaults,noatime 0 2</b> </p></li> 
<li>
<p> hdparm <em>hdparm</em> is a Linux IDE disk utility that lets you set 
spin-down timeouts and other disk parameters. It works also for some SCSI 
features.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Mobile Update Daemon This is a drop-in replacement for the standard <b>
update</b> daemon, <b>mobile-update</b> minimizes disk spin ups and reduces 
disk uptime. It flushes buffers only when other disk activity is present. To 
ensure a consistent file system call<b>sync</b> manually. Otherwise files may 
be lost on power failure.<b>mobile-update</b> does not use APM. So it works 
also on older systems.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> noflushd : <b>noflushd</b> monitors disk activity and spins down disks 
that have been idle for more than &lt;timeout&gt; seconds. It requires a kernel 
&gt;=2.2.11 . Useful in combination with<b>hdparm</b> and <b>mount</b> with <em>
noatime</em> option to bring down disk activity. </p>
<p> Here are some comments and thoughts by Nat Makarevitch about a possible 
approach which may reduce the disk activity under Linux (sparing energy, 
especially with noflushd) the file Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt of the 
Linux sourcetree documents some useful features, esp. in the/proc/sys/vm 
section. Under Linux 2.2 I used:</p> 
<pre> echo &quot;100 5000 8 256 500 60000 60000 1884 2&quot; &gt; 
/proc/sys/vm/bdflush</pre> <br>
<br>
 especially under Linux 2.4 which uses its 
spare time to 'pre-save' the less-used memory pages into the swap, increasing 
the disk activity I tried to figure the more adequate parameters (Linux 2.4.9, 
192 MB RAM, Toshiba 3480 laptop) beware: some of those parameters may be 
dangerous or useless (I have not gathered serious data about the practical 
efficiency). moreover do not forget that delaying disk writes of data is 
intrinsically dangerous 
<pre> echo 99 512 32 512 0 300000 60 0 0 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/bdflush # is '60' 
the max value for age_super? echo 1 1 96 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/buffermem echo 512 
128 32 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/kswapd echo 1 10 96 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/pagecache</pre>

<p></p> 
<p> Some more words about disks spin down with <b>noflushd</b> or <b>hdparm</b>
 utilities. The objective is to reduce hard disk usage to minimum, because on 
most laptops it is the primary source of noise and energy consumption. The 
&quot;noflushd&quot; daemon is a replacement of &quot;update&quot; which makes 
buffer updates on disk only when some other data is being read from the disk 
(the behavior of &quot;update&quot; is to flush buffers every 5 seconds, and it 
usually generates constant disk activity, so that the disk never becomes idle). 
&quot;noflushd&quot; also sets the disk spindown time and automatically calls 
&quot;sync&quot; before spindown. The syntax is something like &quot;noflushd 
-n 5 /dev/hda&quot;. Using &quot;noflushd&quot; may cause loss of data if some 
files were edited while the disk was parked and not sync'ed, e.g. if the power 
was suddenly lost.</p> 
<p> The <b>hdparm</b> utility can set the sleep time too, and also tune the 
IDE disk parameters for better performance. Make sure that the kernel IDE 
parameter &quot;Use DMA by default when available&quot; (section &quot;Block 
devices&quot;) is enabled.</p> 
<p> However, it is not enough to enable <b>noflushd</b> or IDE disk sleep time 
to make the disk effectively silent, because the system in most default 
installations is running many cron jobs, writes to log files, uses swap and so 
on. This activity is not always desirable, especially if the computer is 
standalone (not on network) and is used mostly by one user. Here are some 
recommendations.</p> 
<p> First, the cron daemon and friends (anacron, atd, logrotate, sendmail / 
exim / ...) could be removed from the system if the services they run (such as, 
cleaning /tmp directories and logs, checking email etc.) are not needed.</p> 
<p> Secondly, the syslogd configuration file /etc/syslog.conf should be 
modified to reduce the number of log files and messages logged, and also to 
have &quot;-&quot; signs before every file name (which means that the system 
will not have to sync the disk every time a message is logged).</p> 
<p> Also, it is advisable to add &quot;mark:none;&quot; to the 
&quot;syslog&quot; strings, so that the &quot;strich strich strich MARK strich 
strich strich&quot; messages do not get written to the log files every half an 
hour. Typical Linux installations today have too many log files for the home 
user.</p> 
<p> Finally, the disk may not go to sleep when a lot of swap space is in use. 
Type &quot;free&quot; and see how much swap is being used and how much free RAM 
is available. If you think there is enough free RAM to work without swap, or if 
there is a lot of swap used AND also a lot of free RAM, consider freeing the 
swap space (&quot;su; swapoff -a; swapon -a&quot;) or switching the swap space 
off altogether (&quot;su; swapoff -a&quot;). Working without swap should be 
fine on systems with 64MB or more of RAM. (Working without swap will reduce the 
available memory, of course, and some software crashes without warning when it 
runs out of memory. But, adding swap will not prevent the crash resulting from 
some runaway memory consumuing software, it will only delay it, and it will 
make the system swap a lot before it happens.)</p> 
<p> With these changes in the system, one could get the laptop to work for 
extended periods of time with its hard disk switched off.</p> 
<p> The kernel can be configured with &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;APM 
Support&quot; and &quot;Enable console blanking using APM&quot; (section 
&quot;General setup&quot;). Then the LCD screen lamp will shut off in console 
mode (so not just the screen goes black, but also the lamp). In X mode, the 
same effect can be obtained with &quot;xset +dpms&quot; (enable DPMS function) 
and &quot;xset s blank&quot; (enable screen blanking). One can add these 
commands to the X window session or window manager initialization scripts.</p> 
<p> The computer's BIOS energy savings options (hard disk sleep time, video 
blanking time and so on) are probably not useful and in some cases may even 
cause crashes. Therefore they could be disabled in the laptop's BIOS.</p>

<p> Many kernel features are related to laptops. For instance APM, IrDA&reg;, 
PCMCIA and some options for certain laptops, e.g. IBM&trade; ThinkPads. In some 
distributions they are not included by default. And the kernel is usually 
bigger than necessary. So it's seems a good idea to customize the kernel. 
Though this task might seem difficult for the beginner it is highly 
recommended. Since this involves dangerous operations you need to be careful. 
But, if you can install a better kernel successfully, you've earned your 
intermediate Linux sysadmin merit badge. - I will not handle this here, because 
this topic is already covered in other documents.</p> 
<p> Compile a modular kernel with modules for CDROM, floppy, pcmcia, sound and 
any other peripherals. It will allow to delay loading of these modules until 
these devices are actually used, and it may help recover the system after a 
hardware failure, e.g. a bad CDROM, because a module can be removed and 
re-inserted without restarting the system.</p>

<h1>Appendix F. Ecology and Laptops</h1> 
<h1>F.1. Ecological Comparisons of Computers</h1> 
<p> Scientists of ReUse project located at the Technical University of Berlin 
recently compared the energy consumption of different computer types along the 
life cycle. The production of computers actually needs 535 kWh which is 10 % 
less than 4 years ago. Most of the energy will be consumed while the computer 
is used for example at work for 8 hours/day. The energy consumption of new 
computers with 2,5-3 GHz processors is even in the stand-bye-mode still 100 
Watt, whereas a 1,4 GHz PC needs 80 Watt and a 4 year old PC only needed 60 
Watt. Therefore from the ecological point of view it is better to buy an old 
computer that didn't need the energy for a new production and which consumes 
less electricity while it is being used.</p> 
<p> LCD displays need less energy than other monitors. For this reason laptops 
are the most ecological types of the compared computers. They need the smallest 
amount of energy when they are used. And 3 year old laptops are better than new 
ones since their processors need less energy than new ones. There is also an 
article in the German computer magazineC't 21/ 2003. </p>

<h1>Appendix G. NeoMagic Graphics Chipset Series NM20xx</h1> 
<h1>G.1. Introduction</h1> 
<p> The NeoMagic graphics chipset series NM20xx has been popular in laptops 
build around 1996. For a long time this graphics chip was only supported by 
commercial X11 servers, since the middle of 1998 RedHat provided a binary X11 
server manufactured by PrecisionInsight. Since version 3.3.3 the appropriate 
X11 server is also available in XFree86.</p> 
<h1>G.2. Textmode 100x37</h1> 
<p> This chapter is a courtesy of Cedric Adjih , though I have changed some 
minor parts. Please note: Another method to achieve a better resolution in text 
mode is the use of the framebuffer driver (as explained in the X-Windows 
chapter above). This method requires kernel reconfiguration (some Linux 
distributions include an appropriate kernel already) and a new entry (vga=NNN) 
in/etc/lilo.conf. In text mode it works even with VESA BIOSes before version 
2.0, at least on the models I could test it. Though the SVGATextMode method 
could be faster (couldn't check this yet).</p> 
<p> An apparently little known fact about the Neomagic chipset NM20xx is that 
you can run text mode in 100x37 (i.e. 800x600). This text mode is very nice (as 
opposed to the 80x25 which is ugly). I tried this with a HP OmniBook 800 and 
suppose it might work with other laptops using the NeoMagic chip, too.</p> 
<p> The main problem is that is a bit difficult to set up, and if you're going 
wrong with the commands<b>SVGATextMode</b> or <b>restoretextmode</b> some 
results on theLCD might be frightening. Although I didn't manage to break my LCD

see any text before the following two steps aren't done.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Automatically run <b>restoretextmode</b> with correct register data. </p>
</li> 
<li>
<p> Automatically run <b>SVGATextMode</b>. </p></li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h2>G.2.2. More Details</h2> 
<p> All the files I have modified, are available for now on my pages </p> 
<h3>G.2.2.1. Enabling Linux to Boot in 800x600</h3> 
<p> Recent kernels (2.2.x) need to be compiled with CONFIG_VIDEO_GFX_HACK 
defined. Default is off. (look in/usr/src/linux-2.2.x/arch/i386/boot/video.S) 
</p> 
<p> This is done by passing the parameter <b>vga=770</b> to older kernels or 
<b>vga=7</b> to 2.2.x kernels. Example with lilo.conf: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> image=/boot/bzImage-modif label=22 
append=&quot;svgatextmode=100x37x8_SVGA&quot; #explained later vga=7 read-only
</pre> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h3>G.2.2.2. Running restoretextmode and SVGATextMode at Boot Time</h3> 
<p> Running <b>restoretextmode</b> and <b>SVGATextMode</b> at Boot Time. You 
must arrange to run<b>restoretextmode &lt;name of some textreg.dat file&gt;</b> 
and<b>SVGATextMode 100x37x8_SVGA</b> at boot time. </p> 
<p> An example textreg.dat for restoretextmode (obtained using <b>savetextmode
</b>) is in my tar archive in tmp/, and an example /etc/TextConfig. </p> 
<p> Since I'm lazy, I've simply put <b>SVGATextMode</b> and <b>restoretextmode
</b> in the /etc/rc.boot/kbd file from my Debian/GNU Linux which get executed 
at boot time (also available in the tar archive).</p> 
<h3>G.2.2.3. Now the Key Point</h3> 
<p> Annoying things will be displayed if you don't use the right SVGATextMode 
in the right video text mode: this is why I also pass the environmental variable
<b>&quot;svgatextmode=100x37x8_SVGA&quot;</b> (arbitrary name) to the kernel 
(using append=xxx in lilo.conf) when I also set<b>vga=7</b>: the script 
/etc/rc.boot/kbd tests this variable and calls <b>restoretextmode</b> and <b>
SVGATextMode</b> IF AND ONLY IF. </p> 
<h2>G.2.3. Road Map</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<ol> 
<li>
<p> Recompile the kernel 2.2.x with CONFIG_VIDEO_GFX_HACK </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Insert the restoretextmode with the correct parameter in the 
initialisation script, with no other changes.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Boot with normal text mode (80x25) but restoretextmode: you should see the 
screen going to 100x37, but with only 80x25 usable. Don't use SVGATextMode yet.
</p></li> 
<li>
<p> It is much better to conditionnalize your initialize code as I did, to 
keep the possibility of booting in both modes: you may test this now with some 
reboots (starting restoretextmode or not).</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Boot with 100x37 text mode using parameter <b>vga=7</b> (lilo.conf), you 
should see white background at some point, but the characters will be black on 
black. This is ok. You'll have to reboot blindly now.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Insert the &lt;path&gt;/SVGATextMode 100x37x8_SVGA after the 
restoretextmode in initialization scripts.</p></li> 
<li>
<p> Reboot with <b>vga=7</b> (lilo.conf) </p></li> 
<li>
<p> Should be OK now. Enjoy. </p></li> </ol>

<p> Scott Mueller: Upgrading and Repairing Laptops, 2003 </p> 
<p> From the publisher: &quot;Scott Mueller goes where no computer book author 
has gone before right past all the warranty stickers, the hidden screws, and 
the fear factor to produce a real owner's manual that every laptop owner should 
have on his desk. This book shows the upgrades users can perform, the ones that 
are better left to the manufacturer, and how to use add-on peripherals to make 
the most of a laptop. The CD contains one-of-a-kind video showing just what's 
inside a portable PC.&quot;Amazon Order. </p>

<p> Chris Hurley, Michael Puchol, Russ Rogers, Frank Thornton: WarDriving - 
Drive, Detect, Defend, A Guide to Wireless Security, 2004</p> 
<p> From the Publisher: &quot;Wardriving has brought some of the top people in 
the wireless industry together to put together a truly informative book on what 
wardriving is and the tools that should be part of any IT department's arsenal 
that either has wireless or is looking to deploy it.&quot; -John Kleinschmidt, 
Michiganwireless.org Founder The practice of WarDriving is a unique combination 
of hobby, sociological research, and security assessment. The act of driving or 
walking through urban areas with a wireless-equipped laptop to map both 
protected and un-protected wireless networks has sparked intense debate amongst 
lawmakers, security professionals, and the telecommunications industry. This 
first ever book on WarDriving is written from the inside perspective of those 
who have created the tools that make WarDriving possible and those who gather, 
analyze, and maintain data on all secured and open wireless access points in 
very major, metropolitan area worldwide. These insiders also provide the 
information to secure your wireless network before it is exploited by criminal 
hackers. Wireless networks have become a way of life in the past two years. As 
more wireless networks are deployed the need to secure them increases. This 
book educates users of wireless networks as well as those who run the networks 
about the insecurities associated with wireless networking. This effort is 
called WarDriving. In order to successfully WarDrive there are hardware and 
software tool required. This book covers those tools, along with cost estimates 
and recommendations. Since there are hundreds of possible configurations that 
can be used for WarDriving, some of the most popular are presented to help 
readers decide what to buy for their own WarDriving setup. Many of the tools 
that a WarDriver uses are the same tools that could be used by an attacker to 
gain unauthorized access to a wireless network. Since this is not the goal of a 
WarDriver, the methodology that users can use to ethically WarDrive is 
presented. In addition, complete coverage of WarDriving applications, such as 
NetStumbler, MiniStumbler; and Kismet, are covered.&quot;Amazon Order. </p>

<p> Isidor Buchmann: Batteries in a Portable World - A Handbook on 
Rechargeable Batteries for Non-Engineers, 2001</p> 
<p> From the Publisher: &quot;Batteries in a Portable World fills a definite 
need for practical information about rechargeable batteries. Quite often, 
performance specifications for batteries and chargers are based on ideal 
conditions. Manufacturers carry out battery tests on brand new equipment and in 
a protected environment, removed from the stress of daily use. In Batteries in 
a Portable World, Mr. Buchmann observes the battery in everyday life in the 
hands of the common user. By reading Batteries in a Portable World, you will 
acquire a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of the battery. 
You will learn how to prolong battery life; become familiar with recommended 
maintenance methods and discover ways to restore a weak battery, if such a 
method is available for that battery type. Knowing how to take care of your 
batteries prolongs service life, improves reliability of portable equipment and 
saves money. Best of all, well-performing batteries need replacement less 
often, reducing the environmental concern of battery disposal.&quot;Amazon Order

<h1>Appendix I. Resources for Specific Laptop Brands</h1> 
<p> Certain laptops have found some more enthusiastic Linux users, than other 
models. This list is probably not comprehensive:</p> 
<h1>I.1. COMPAQ Concerto Aero</h1> 
<p> COMPAQ Concerto Fan's Home Page and Aero-FAQ . </p> 
<p> The latest version of the Linux Compaq Concerto Pen Driver is available 
from Joe Pfeiffer's home page.</p> 
<h1>I.2. DELL</h1> 
<p> Mailing list at linux-dell-laptops </p> 
<p> Manufacturer Linux information: DELL </p> 
<h1>I.3. IBM&trade; ThinkPad</h1>

linux-thinkpad-subscribe_at_topica.com</b>, to post send mail to <b>
linux-thinkpad_at_topica.com</b> . See here for details. </p> 
<p> TrackPoint driver by Till Straumann. </p> 
<h1>I.4. Sony VAIO</h1> 
<p> For installation on VAIOs via external CD drive, see chapter Installation 
above. Some hints for the Jog-Dial you may find in the chapter Mice Species. 
The SONY VAIO C1 series includes some models, which are based on the first 
dedicated mobile CPU, the CRUSOE. The CRUSOE is manufactured byTransMeta . At 
TransMeta you may find information about the binary compatibility of the 
CRUSOE. TheSony PCG-C1XS Picturebook Camera Capture program captures images and 
movies on a Sony VAIO picturebook PCG-C1XS, taking advantage of the built in 
CCD camera and hardware JPEG encoder. It features PPM capture, JPEG capture 
(hardware JPEG), AVI capture of MJPEG, MJPEG capture of separate frames (for 
MPEG encoding), setting of brightness/contrast/etc., and a 1:4 sub-sampling 
option.</p> 
<p> There are two HOWTOs available: The Linux SONY Vaio PCG-C1XD HOWTO by 
Philippe CADIC &lt;ccadic_AT_cadic.com&gt;. And the VAIO-HOWTO at the LDP.</p> 
<p> There is also a VAIO C1 related Linux mailing list, too 
&lt;linux-c1_at_gnu.org&gt;.</p> 
<p> Sony Vaio C1 FAQ mostly MS-Windows related, but contains useful hardware 
information and a mailing list.</p> 
<p> The SONY VAIO SPIC daemon is a fast and small hack for create a working 
apmd to Sony VAIO laptops. It uses the sonypi kernel module to detect the AC 
adapter status and the LCD backlight, and cpufreq for CPU frequency change.</p> 
<p> spicctrl uses the sonypi interface provided by /dev/sonypi and the Linux 
kernel.</p> 
<h1>I.5. Toshiba</h1> 
<p> Toshiba Linux Utilities This is a set of Linux utilities for controlling 
the fan, supervisor passwords, and hot key functions of Toshiba Pentium 
notebooks. There is a KDE package<em>Klibreta</em>, too. </p> 
<p> See also Toshiba Linux Utilities </p> 
<p> Mailing lists: linux-on-portege , Linux on Toshiba Satellite 40xx 
linux-tosh-40xx &lt;majordomo_at_geekstuff.co.uk&gt;.</p> 
<p> Toshiba itself offers now Toshiba Linux Support (Japanese branch) and 
Toshiba Linux Support (German branch) . </p> 
<p> Linux replacements for Toshiba laptop utilities. The Toshiba Linux 
Utilities package contains some Toshiba laptop goodies. Utilities to control 
the fan, change supervisor passwords, adjust power/battery modes and reassign 
the function key &lt;FN&gt; are included.</p>

<h2>K.2.1. 0. PREAMBLE</h2> 
<p> The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other 
written document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone 
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying 
it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves 
for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not 
being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p> 
<p> This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that 
derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It 
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license 
designed for free software.</p> 
<p> We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free 
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should 
come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this 
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual 
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed 
book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is 
instruction or reference.</p> 
<h2>K.2.2. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h2> 
<p> This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of 
this License. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or 
work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as 
&quot;you&quot;.</p> 
<p> A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing 
the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications 
and/or translated into another language.</p> 
<p> A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter 
section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the 
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to 
related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that 
overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of 
mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The 
relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or 
with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or 
political position regarding them.</p> 
<p> The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose 
titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that 
says that the Document is released under this License.</p> 
<p> The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are 
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that 
the Document is released under this License.</p> 
<p> A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable 
copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general 
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly 
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint 
programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is 
suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety 
of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise 
Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage 
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not 
&quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p> 
<p> Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII 
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a 
publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human 
modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that 
can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for 
which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the 
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes 
only.</p> 
<p> The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page 
itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material 
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which 
do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near 
the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of 
the body of the text.</p>

<p> You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either 
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright 
notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are 
reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to 
those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or 
control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. 
However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute 
a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 
3.</p> 
<p> You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you 
may publicly display copies.</p> 
<h2>K.2.4. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h2> 
<p> If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and 
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies 
in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover 
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers 
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. 
The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally 
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title 
of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim 
copying in other respects.</p> 
<p> If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, 
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual 
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p> 
<p> If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more 
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along 
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a 
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent 
copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using 
public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard 
network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably 
prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to 
ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated 
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque 
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the 
public.</p> 
<p> It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the 
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a 
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p> 
<h2>K.2.5. 4. MODIFICATIONS</h2> 
<p> You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the 
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified 
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the 
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the 
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do 
these things in the Modified Version:</p> 
<p> A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from 
that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if 
there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use 
the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version 
gives permission.</p> 
<p> B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities 
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, 
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of 
its principal authors, if it has less than five).</p> 
<p> C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified 
Version, as the publisher.</p> 
<p> D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. </p> 
<p> E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to 
the other copyright notices.</p> 
<p> F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice 
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of 
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p> 
<p> G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections 
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p> 
<p> H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. </p> 
<p> I. Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and 
add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher 
of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section 
entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, 
year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then 
add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</p> 
<p> J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public 
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network 
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These 
may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network 
location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document 
itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives 
permission.</p> 
<p> K. In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or 
&quot;Dedications&quot;, preserve the section's title, and preserve in the 
section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements 
and/or dedications given therein.</p> 
<p> L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their 
text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered 
part of the section titles.</p> 
<p> M. Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section 
may not be included in the Modified Version.</p> 
<p> N. Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to 
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p> 
<p> If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices 
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the 
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as 
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in 
the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any 
other section titles.</p> 
<p> You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it 
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties 
for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an 
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p> 
<p> You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a 
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover 
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of 
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one 
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, 
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are 
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, 
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p> 
<p> The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give 
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply 
endorsement of any Modified Version.</p> 
<h2>K.2.6. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h2> 
<p> You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, 
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of 
all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant 
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.</p> 
<p> The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple 
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are 
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the 
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, 
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else 
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of 
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p> 
<p> In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled 
&quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section 
entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled 
&quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections entitled 
&quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections entitled 
&quot;Endorsements.&quot;</p> 
<h2>K.2.7. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h2> 
<p> You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents 
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License 
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, 
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each 
of the documents in all other respects.</p> 
<p> You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute 
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License 
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects 
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p> 
<h2>K.2.8. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h2> 
<p> A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and 
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, 
provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a 
compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this License does not apply 
to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account 
of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of 
the Document.</p> 
<p> If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies 
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire 
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround 
only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers 
around the whole aggregate.</p> 
<h2>K.2.9. 8. TRANSLATION</h2> 
<p> Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant 
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright 
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in 
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include 
a translation of this License provided that you also include the original 
English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the 
translation and the original English version of this License, the original 
English version will prevail.</p> 
<h2>K.2.10. 9. TERMINATION</h2> 
<p> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as 
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p> 
<h2>K.2.11. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h2> 
<p> The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU 
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar 
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p> 
<p> Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License 
&quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any 
later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software 
Foundation.</p> <br>
