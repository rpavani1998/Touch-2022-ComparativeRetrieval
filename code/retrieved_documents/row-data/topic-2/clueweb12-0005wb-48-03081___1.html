 First 
a little background on why laptops are so important. What started off as an 
expensive niche is now the fastest growing sector of the PC business with more 
than 30 million laptops sold last year. Laptops used to regularly run $2,000 - 
$3,000, but over the last few years prices have dropped dramatically. In 
addition, WiFi has made them more practical then ever by allowing for wireless 
net connectivity. Together these factors have pushed the laptop business in 
dollar terms to rival the desktop business (since laptops typically cost 
considerably more than desktops).<br>
<br>
 Up until now, shortcomings in Linux 
have made it a poor choice for this growing population of mobile users. 
Primarily the issue circles around power management...<i>or the lack thereof</i>
. When you close the computer's lid, or it runs low on power or sits idle with 
inactivity, you expect your laptop to go into energy conservation -- more 
commonly referred to as &quot;sleep.&quot; Then you expect to click a key and 
have it awaken and resume where you left off. This is a tricky computational 
task and requires close participation between the software and the hardware 
manufacturers -- something Linux has been slow to develop.<br>

 Some months ago I 
traveled to Taipei to meet with the leading laptop manufacturers to discuss 
this problem. Since that time we've been working closely with many of them on 
their next generation of value-priced laptops (typically under $1000) to ensure 
that we could provide a Linux solution.LindowsOS Laptop Edition is that 
product. It provides basic power management functionality and support for 
internal WiFi cards for a new class of low cost laptops ready to hit the 
market. Today we're making available our Laptop Edition to computer 
manufacturers andend-users for use on their laptop computers. If you've been 
thinking aboutgetting a laptop, you can expect to see a host of new 
Linux-driven laptops hitting the store shelves soon.<br>
<br>
 The first 
machines running LindowsOS Laptop Edition (LE) are available immediately in 
more than 50PC Club stores. A range of laptops to suit every budget and need 
are available starting atjust $899 for a powerful 5.9 lb model. (If you're 
looking for anaffordable laptop for the holiday season, this may be it.)<br>

<br> This is a vital development for Linux because it challenges Microsoft in 
the last PC sector in which they've faced no competition -- laptops. Because 
LindowsOS LE is available to system builders and resellers for less than a 
tenth of the cost of Microsoft Windows XP, you will see a flurry of more 
affordable laptop computers in the months to come. That should put some smiles 
on the faces of a certain 40%.<br>
