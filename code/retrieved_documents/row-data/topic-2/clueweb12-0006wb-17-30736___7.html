<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> <em>Jul 14 2011</em> - MSI's FR720-002US is a very 
powerful system for its price but it has its limitations that makes it best 
suited for very specific users. This is because the laptop lacks items such as 
dedicated graphics or a Blu-ray drive that might benefit those looking to do a 
bit more for entertainment. Still, it makes for an excellent low cost mobile 
platform for someone looking to do some desktop video editing or similarly 
processor intensive tasks. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Solid General Purpose Performance</li> 
<li>Very Affordable For Features</li> 
<li>Free Of Unecessary Trial Applications</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Integrated Graphics</li> 
<li>Would Be Nice To Have Blu-ray</li> 
<li>Drive Partitioning Could Be Better</li> </ul>

<h3>Guide Review - MSI FR720-002US 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop PC</h3>
<p><em>Jul 14 2011</em> - MSI isn't shy about putting performance into a 
reasonably priced 17-inch laptop with the MSI FR720-002US. It comes equipped 
with the latest generation Intel Core i7-2630QM quad core processor. This 
combined with 6GB of DDR3 memory allows the system to power through some of the 
most demanding applications including desktop video editing. With a list price 
of just $900, it is one of the most affordable laptops to feature this 
combination of processor and memory.</p> 
<p>Storage features for the MSI FR720-002US are pretty typically for its $900 
list price but it would be nice to see a bit more. In particular, a Blu-ray 
compatible drive would be a nice step up from the base included dual-layer DVD 
burner. It has the ability to playback and record CD or DVD media but that is 
typical of any laptop that comes with an optical drive. The 640GB capacity hard 
drive is fairly standard although there are competing models that have 750GB 
for those that need a bit more space for applications, data or media files. The 
partitioning of the drive is also a bit weird with data and OS partitions that 
could have been allocated space a little more logically. At least MSI has 
included two of the new USB 3.0 ports for high speed external storage if you 
need additional storage space.</p> 
<p>The 17.3-inch display for the MSI FR720-002US is fairly typical of most 
17-inch laptops. It comes with a relatively high 1600x900 resolution that 
supports 720p high definition video but falls short of 1080p. This isn't a 
major issue as the laptop does not come with a Blu-ray drive. Brightness and 
color are acceptable and the viewing angles are fairly narrow especially on the 
vertical angles. The big issue for many with this laptop is going to be the 
graphics themselves. It does not use a dedicated graphics and instead relies on 
the new Intel HD Graphics 3000 that are built into the new Intel processors. 
This is a big step up from the previous GMA graphics especially for those 
looking to do video encoding work. The problems is that the 3D performance is 
still severely limited to just basic 3D gaming at low resolution and detail 
levels with just Direct X 10 support.</p> 
<p>The keyboard on the MSI FR720 uses an isolated or chiclet style keyboard 
that provides a comfortable and accurate experience. Thanks to its size, a full 
sized numeric keypad is also included on the keyboard. The trackpad is now 
centered off the space bar rather than offset like some previous MSI laptops. A 
rocking button bar is used for the trackpad rather than individual buttons 
which can be problematic at times.</p> 
<p>One nice aspect of MSI's laptops is the software. Many low cost laptops 
from the major companies come loaded with a large amount of applications, most 
of them trialware. MSI provides a much more streamlined environment on the 
FR720 with very few applications preinstalled on the system. This is a welcome 
experience compared to some systems that can take forever to boot because of 
all the applications not to mention having to sort through them on the start 
menus.</p> 
<p>Like many laptops on the market, the MSI FR720-002US comes with a six-cell 
battery pack rated at 4400mA capacity. In DVD playback testing, this yielded 
just over two and three quarter hours of running time before going into standby 
mode. This is pretty typical of laptops in this class and battery size. More 
typical usage should yield between three and a half to four hours.</p> <br>
