<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Apr 22 2011</em> - Gamers looking for ultimate control in configuring a 
gaming desktop will be pleased with the iBUYPOWER Gamer Paladin E860 gaming PC. 
This desktop computer is equipped with the powerful unlocked Intel Core 
i7-2600K processor and 8GB of memory for $1,249, making the Gamer Paladin E860 
a great value. A few upgrades are recommended to make the system more robust 
during gaming, though, including an upgrade to the base NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 
1GB graphics card. But since the Paladin E860 is fully customizable, it scores 
well for both casual and hard-core gamers.</p>

<h3>Review - iBuyPower Gamer Paladin E860 Gaming Desktop Computer</h3> <br>

<p>Dubbed the &quot;Gamer Paladin E860,&quot; it's easy to realize this 
desktop computer from iBUYPOWER is meant for serious gaming. Fully customizable 
down to the slightest detail, the Gamer Paladin E860 is well enough equipped at 
$1,249, but obviously even greater performance parts can be added to create the 
ultimate gaming rig.</p> 
<p>Since many gamers are sticking to a budget nowadays, the $1,249 
configuration is more than adequate for mainstream gaming. For that price, the 
Paladin E860 arrives with an Intel Core i7-2600K processor that is one of the 
best chips on the market today. Since the processor is a &quot;K&quot; model, 
it has a fully unlocked CPU and GPU for some serious overclocking potential. 
The 2600K also has 8MB of L3 cache for enhanced performance.</p> 
<p>Also included for under $1,250 is a Xion Echo Gaming Case in blue that 
gives off that aggressive gaming feel. However, there are a slew of case 
options available so if a full-tower case is up your alley, the system can be 
configured with such a chassis via a simple click of the mouse. The same holds 
true for case lighting.</p> 
<p>Users are now utilizing more and more memory as many programs use quite a 
bit of RAM. The Gamer Paladin E860 doesn't disappoint with 8GB of DDR3 memory. 
As an added bonus, iBUYPOWER often offers free performance upgrades. At the 
time of publication, the 8GB sticks of DDR3-1333 memory are upgraded to 
DDR3-1600 modules, which are faster.</p> 
<p>Since the Gamer Paladin E860 is geared for playing PC titles, the machine 
must have a decent video card. In the $1,249 configuration, an NVIDIA GTX 460 
1GB card is included. If you're on a budget, this card will run the games, but 
if you want to max out settings in-game, an upgrade is worthwhile. A couple of 
options include adding a second GTX 460 in SLI for $195 more or upgrading to 
the AMD Radeon HD 6970 2GB graphics card for an additional $228. However, these 
options require you to also upgrade the power supply over the base 700 watt 
model, which tacks on at least another $58. In reality, the $1,250 model is 
best suited for mainstream gamers who are willing to sacrifice achieving 
knock-out frame rates for an aggressive price.</p> 
<p>Another nice feature is the amount of hard drive space with a 1TB 7200RPM 
standard (a free upgrade to a 2TB drive is available at the time of publication 
as well). Gamers will find this spacious drive to be more than sufficient for 
storing an abundance of games, movies, and music.</p> 
<p>Speaking of movies, the iBUYPOWER Gamer Paladin E860 also features a 
Blu-ray drive for $1,249 with an optional upgrade to a Blu-ray writer for just 
$30 more. This price is quite reasonable, which is nice to see. It's definitely 
an asset to have a Blu-ray drive if you enjoy watching movies on your desktop. 
If you are an audiophile, though, you'll want to add an optional sound card 
over the base onboard audio.</p> 
<p>In summary, the iBUYPOWER Gamer Paladin E860 is great for gamers looking to 
purchase a gaming desktop PC with the options you want in lieu of building it 
yourself. With budget-friendly options, the Gamer Paladin E860 can be 
customized as an entry level system or a tricked out gaming beast. If you 
decide to select the standard $1,249 configuration, though, it's a great value 
overall with an Intel Core i7-2600K processor that is fully unlocked, as well 
as 8GB of memory for smooth performance.</p> Manufacturer's Site <br>
