Solutions &gt; Software &gt; Windows Start Button Gone Forever, Replaced By 
Tutorial <br>

<h1>Windows Start Button Gone Forever, Replaced By Tutorial</h1> 12:00 PM - 
April 1, 2012 by Kevin Parrish - source: The Seattle Times <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Despite complaints stemming from the Consumer Preview, the Start 
Button will not be officially added to Windows 8.</strong></p> 
<p>The Seattle Times reports that the beloved Start Button we've grown 
accustomed to pressing each and every day won't end up in the final version of 
Windows 8 despite complaints. Instead, Windows 7 will be its last, official 
home.</p> 
<p>The news arrives by way of investment banking firm Nomura, which hosted 
meetings this week for investors with Tami Reller, the head of marketing and 
CFO of the Windows and Windows Live Division at Microsoft. The meetings talked 
about what's coming up for the next version of Microsoft's operating system.</p>
<p>According to Nomura, Reller addressed concerns that end users have raised 
about the Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Although the new version -- which offers 
a complete revamp of the UI since the release of Windows 95 -- is seemingly 
well suited for touch-based devices, it's reportedly a headache for the desktop 
user accustomed to accessing the computer's installed programs through the 
Start Menu.</p> 
<p>As it stands now, Windows 8 doesn't feature a Start Button, but rather 
depends on hot corners for essential functionality. Without any instructions 
whatsoever, desktop users must figure out how to navigate through the new Metro 
UI and access the Metro commands to get back to the Start screen. The Seattle 
Times calls this method &quot;unintuitive and clunky.&quot;</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Reller confirmed that Microsoft has officially killed off 
the Start Button for good. Instead, the discoverability problem will be 
addressed through a tutorial &quot;to show keyboard/mouse users the new 
commands that they need to orient themselves with in the new OS so they are not 
lost when they first encounter the product.&quot;</p> 
<p>Isn't that nice?</p> 
<p>Reller also assured investors that Office 15 will feel unaltered in Windows 
8's desktop mode when using Office even though the new suite has been 
Metro-ized.</p> 
<p>RIP, Start Button. We loved you. Honest.</p> Share: <br>

<p>I am a PC fanboy, and this looks awful.<br>
<br>
The fundamental purpose of 
an OS for me is to provide and invisible interface to access all of MY stuff MY 
way. It looks like Microsoft is trying to turn the OS into an application 
itself. This is not what I want, I want to have a clear, clean, fast, 
customizable utility to do what I desire.<br>
<br>
I want to see my OS do all 
the back-end stuff (anti-virus, backup, file management, etc.) in the cleanest, 
fastest way possible. These things should happen in the background, and not 
distract me from doing the things I want (games, internet, Word, Excel, etc.).
<br><br>
The implication here is you are supposed to *use* the OS as an 
application. No thanks.</p> iceman1992  04/01/2012 6:15 PM <br>

<p>I am having my suspicions here, is this an April Fool's prank? <br>

Assuming it isn't : Smart move Microsoft. removing a landmark of a button from 
the interface. I honestly don't know how well it's gonna work. The saying 
&quot;If it ain't broken, don't fix it&quot; maybe appropriate here.<br>
<br>

Assuming it is : Very funny toms!</p> remyj123  04/01/2012 6:19 PM <br>

<p>I really think MS is shooting themselves in the foot on this. Whereas I 
understand them wanting to make the interface identical across all formats of 
computing, pretty much everyone agrees the Metro interface is not as useful on 
a desktop or laptop PC as it is on a phone or a tablet. Businesses are not 
going to like Windows 8 on their PC workstations.<br>
<br>
If they ask me, and 
they haven't, I would compromise by making the desktop version of Windows 8 
essentially an update of Windows 7 and then toss the Metro tiles on the 
desktop. If people want to use them, they can, if they want to go to the start 
menu or task bar and launch from there as they have in the past, they still 
could.<br>
<br>
Why does this have to be an all or nothing proposition?</p>

<p>When using the Preview Build, I found myself using Ctrl + Alt + Del a lot 
to bring up the task bar and kill Metro or to back-out of Metro apps (some 
appeared to not have any way to navigate back). The whole time I played with 
Win 8, I though to myself how much I appreciate the fact that Windows 7 is so 
good and that I really didn't need to upgrade to Windows 8. Thank goodness too, 
it felt like using a cell phone instead of using a PC. What the heck, Microsoft?

<p>This is going to backfire in a big way. The avg consumor will not take 
kindly to this change. I'm willing to bet many avg consumors will want to 
revert back to Windows 7 after trying to figure out Windows 8 which will prompt 
many pc vendors to do a downgrade program. It's not like getting rid or quick 
launch, the start menu is a pretty big thing for many users. At the very least 
MS should have an option to enable the start menu.</p> Devoteicon  04/01/2012

<p>Finally,Windows has become like Apple:<br>
If you want to do something in 
it,it's impossible!<br>
<br>
Let's all call it a day, and jump over to Linux, 
now that all 3 platforms are performing about the same, but at least with 
Linux, you have a simplified user interface, and you can do OS customizations 
via all kinds of advanced menu's and the shell; something which might take 
forever in Windows 8.</p> EzioAs  04/01/2012 7:01 PM <br>

<p></p> <b>maddy143ded :</b><br>
this just means that unless windows 8 has 
some clearly compelling performance boost like they claim for multicore usage 
(which as far as i know has not yet been proved ) most people will not want to 
go for an upgrade to windows 8. i will keep using widows 7 on my desktop as 
well as laptop for the foreseeable future.and it doesn't feel right to use a OS 
as heavy as windows 8(i think it was somewhere around 12GB of installation) on 
a tablet. whatever win 8 can do in 12 gb+ space android/ios/ubuntu can do it 
better in just 1-2 gb space.so effectively Microsoft is shooting itself in the 
ass with this move. they should have just upgraded the windows phone 8 for 
usage on a tablet, instead they are destroying their only plus point in the 
computer market.i do not believe that the tablet can replace a laptop in its 
usage.. a netbook yes definitely, an ultra-book most probably, but not a full 
blown laptop/desktop system. i really wish that companies would stop promoting 
the stupid tablets as a computer replacement and instead promote it as a 
computer compliment.one of the main reason ubuntu/mint os has not replaced my 
windows installation is their poor attempt to copy the start menu.. and i have 
been tinkering with different linux OSes since 2003(when i got my first linux 
os as a free cd.) i have even tried mac os (hacintosh some one?) but the ease 
of use and familiarity and the collection of games keep pulling me back to 
windows.well windows 7 seems good enough for use for next 5-7 years, till then 
something will give...(meaning M$ will see the falling OS sales and go back to 
basics as it were....I really feel strongly about one thing that m$ could have 
done right, reduce the god damn size of the OS . i mean 20 fu*king Gbs for just 
the installation? just because RAM and HDD are cheap (relatively ) doesnt give 
them the right to keep increasing its usage........<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>A netbook yes???? Really, where you been, THEY ARE GONE!!!!! <br>

Vista 2.0 is Windows 7 (I want to call you a name)... also, 
vista wasn't all that bad if you actually stayed with it for awhile. It was the 
first time Microsoft released a OS on time... Vendors were in a made rush to 
get drivers out and people were trying to upgrade old ill working machines to 
Vista... I fuggen hate people that compare without knowledge but based off they 
say... Stupid...

<p>I am seriously wondering what's happening at the top of Microsoft. Some of 
the decisions they make are so obviously STUPID that it makes you wonder a) who 
managed to come up with them and b) how the hell those changes were kept 
despite nothing but negative feedback.<br>
But I guess that's win8 in a 
nutshell. Instead of making touch devices better, they just decide to make the 
desktop PC worse - that also works to bring them to the same level! This is 
just Microsoft seeing Apple's success and trying to replicate that in ways and 
places that just DO NOT WORK. I don't understand how there are so many 'common' 
people that have good ideas, yet Microsoft pays millions for a couple of people 
that clearly don't...</p> LordConrad  04/01/2012 7:26 PM <br>
