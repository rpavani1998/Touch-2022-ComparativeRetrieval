<h1>College Computers: Desktop vs. Notebook</h1> 
<p>Once a decision has been made to buy a new college computer, the next 
common question is whether it should be a notebook (also called a laptop) or a 
desktop style computer. (The &quot;desktop&quot; category includes true 
horizontal desktop models as well as mini-tower and tower models that can stand 
vertically on the floor or desktop.)</p>

<p>As with many aspects of the college process, there is no &quot;right&quot; 
answer to the desktop vs. notebook debate. Each comes with significant 
advantages and disadvantages, and which is better will depend on the needs and 
preferences of the student.</p> 
<h4>Notebook Computer for College - Advantages</h4> 
<p>- Easy to transport to and from school.<br>
 - Takes up little dorm space 
or desk space.<br>
 - Can be carried to class or library for note-taking, 
study, etc.<br>
 - If wireless network is available, adding a wireless card 
provides easy access to college network and Internet in many locations on 
campus. Newer notebook computers may have built-in wireless networking ability.
<br> - Can be brought home during weekend or holiday visits.<br>
 - Can be 
shipped to manufacturer or taken to dealer for service.</p> 
<h4>Notebook Computer for College - Disadvantages</h4> 
<p>- Much more easily stolen, particularly if carried around campus.<br>
 - 
More easily dropped or broken.<br>
 - Somewhat more prone to failure than 
stationary desktop computers of comparable quality.<br>
 - Significantly more 
expensive for comparable speed and capacity.<br>
 - Limited expansion and 
add-on capabilities.</p> 
<h4>Desktop Computer for College - Advantages</h4> 
<p>- Best value: typically, more speed, memory, and storage for a lower price.
<br> - Relatively difficult to steal.<br>
 - Lower probability of failure for 
comparable quality machine vs. notebook.<br>
 - Relatively easy to expand or 
modify as needs change.<br>
 - Less costly expansion products such as large 
hard drives, additional memory, and special purpose cards.<br>
 - Flat screen 
LCD monitors are now reasonably priced, reducing desk space requirements and 
making storage/shipping easier.</p> 
<h4>Desktop Computer for College - Disadvantages</h4> 
<p>- Space-consuming and awkward to move to and from school.<br>
 - Takes up 
valuable real estate in cramped dorm rooms<br>
 - Can't be carried to library 
or classes.<br>
 - Difficult to ship if repair/replacement is needed.</p> 
<p>Part of this decision process involves the way people use their computers 
on the specific campus the student will attend. This would be a great topic to 
ask about during campus visits, prospective student days, and early 
orientation. Also, present students can be queried by e-mail for more input. If 
most students have notebooks and there is a great deal of collaboration 
required, a portable computer might be essential. In most campus environments, 
though, a desktop is the more common choice.</p>
