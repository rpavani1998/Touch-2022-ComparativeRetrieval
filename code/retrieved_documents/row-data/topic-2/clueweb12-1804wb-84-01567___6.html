<strong>London Hardware desktop &amp; laptop upgrade 
Experts</strong> <br>

 Desktop /Laptop upgrades support 
<p>We will help you upgrade your laptop and desktop personal computers. PC 
components connect like building blocks. Component sizes, screw threads, 
mounting hole positions, cable connectors, and so on are standardized, so you 
needn't worry about whether something will fit.</p> 
<p>There are minor exceptions, of course. For example, some small cases accept 
only half-height or half-length expansion cards. There are important details, 
certainly. If you're upgrading your processor, for example, you must verify 
that your current motherboard supports the new processor.</p> <br>
 Desktop PC 
and Laptop upgrades Service 
<p>Hardware upgrades are the more cost efficient alternative against a new 
computer. If your pc or laptop is only a few years old but seems to be 
struggling a bit with all the new 'starving' programs, a quick upgrade could be 
just a solution!</p> 
<p>PC hardware and laptop hardware upgrades includes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>More memory upgrade - To get things moving a bit faster</li> 
<li>Bigger hard drive upgrade - For more storage space</li> 
<li>Graphics card upgrade - For the latest games etc.</li> 
<li>DVD Writer upgrade - For back up, movies &amp; music etc.</li> </ul> 
<p>Not all systems would greatly benefit from hardware upgrades, especially if 
they are becoming out of date. Older components get more expensive as demand 
reduces.</p> 
<p>PC hardware upgrades have become so frequent that customers with six to 12 
month installations have been asking for guarantees that the hardware they 
install at the end of the process will still be compatible with the boxes they 
set up at the start. Changes in BIOS and software driver updates all make it 
harder and more expensive to effectively manage the environment. Upgrading a PC 
is much easier than upgrading a laptop from the standpoint of getting the case 
open. The parts are much cheaper, easier to install and extremely compatible, 
unlike notebook parts which are usually brand and model specific.</p> <br>
