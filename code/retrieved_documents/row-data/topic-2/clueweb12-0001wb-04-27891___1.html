 Laptop computers are wonderful 
pieces of technology. They allow you to take immense computing power with you 
where ever you go. Unfortunately, certainergonomic features are compromised for 
the sake of portability. Posture, keyboard spacing, screen size and 
positioning, and pointing devices usually take the biggest ergonomic hit.
<p> Even though laptops are designed for portability, many people use them as 
a desktop computer. Despite the poor ergonomics inherent in most laptops, 
certain steps can be taken to create a sound ergonomic laptop setup as a 
desktop. Whether it's as a main computer or a temporary setup, you can improve 
your ergonomics.</p> 
<p><b>The Main Ergonomic Issues with Laptops</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keyboard spacing - laptop keyboards are often compact with odd placement 
of some keys and cramped spacing of others. Hand cramps andrepetitive stress 
injuries are more of a concern on compact keyboards. Preventing wrist 
repetitive stress injuries becomes even more of a priority. </li> 
<li> Monitor size - laptop screens are often smaller than desktop monitors. 
Small screens can cause moreeye strain than larger ones. Preventing eye strain 
becomes even more of a priority as well.</li> 
<li> Monitor placement - the relation of the keyboard to monitor on a laptop 
is fixed. Aproper ergonomic monitor setup has the monitor and keyboard at 
different levels and spaced far apart. This placement causes bad posture with 
either arms and hands held high or the neck and back bent low. Both of which 
can cause some serious problems and pain.</li> 
<li> Small pointers - laptops usually have an integrated pointing device such 
as a touch pad or dot. These devices are adequate for there task, but not very 
comfortable or easy to use for long periods of time. Wrist related repetitive 
stress injuries pop up here as well.</li> </ul> <b>General Ergonomic Tips</b> 
<ul> 
<li>Make your laptop setup as close to the desktop ergonomic computer station 
setup as possible. </li> 
<li>Keep the wrists in the most natural wrist position that you can achieve. 
</li> 
<li>Rotate the screen so that bending of the neck is minimized. </li> 
<li>Tuck the chin in to rotate the head instead of bending the neck. </li> 
</ul> <b>The Best Ergonomic Laptop Solution</b> 
<p> Use a laptop docking station. These devices let you plug in your laptop to 
a base station that has a monitor, keyboard and mouse already connected. You 
basically have a desktop setup with a removable computer that just happens to 
have a keyboard and screen attached.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Laptop Docking Stations </li> </ul> 
<p> <b>The Next Best Ergonomic Laptop Solution</b> </p> 
<p> If a docking station is out of your budget or otherwise impractical do the 
next best thing. Have a separate keyboard and mouse at the desk. This lets you 
place the laptop at the correct monitor position and have a comfortable 
keyboard and mouse at their proper locations.</p> 
<p> <b>The Makeshift Ergonomic Solution</b> </p> 
<p> If you can not get a separate keyboard and mouse, or you are in a 
temporary location there is still plenty you can do to improve your laptop 
ergonomic setup.</p> 
<p> Run through a quick task analysis to determine what the main thing you 
will be doing is. If it is reading, then set the laptop up in aproper ergonomic 
monitor position. If it is typing, then set the laptop up in a proper ergonomic 
keyboard position. If it is a mix, then set the laptop up in a proper ergonomic 
keyboard setup. The large muscles of the back and neck can take more stress 
than the arms and wrists so the bending of the neck to read the screen is the 
lesser of two ergonomic evils.</p> 
<p> If you have to place the laptop on a desktop, and thereby be higher than a 
good keyboard height, try changing planes. Elevate the rear of the laptop so 
that the keyboard is inclined. Then lean back in your chair so that your arms 
are now in line with the keyboard.</p> 
<p> <b>Summary</b> </p> 
<p> Laptops do not make good ergonomic desktops. They are not even that 
ergonomically sound on your lap. But that is not why you have one. Still, with 
a little diligence and a few accessories you can make your laptop work for you 
as a desktop. </p>
