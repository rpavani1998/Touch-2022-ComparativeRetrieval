<h2>A Laptop or a Full-Sized Computer: Choose Your Thing for College</h2> 
February 16, 2011 by admin Leave a Comment <br>

<p>A college freshman needs to deal with many new things in the college, such 
as projects, assignments, research, deadlines, etc. As a freshman, it is quite 
helpful to have your own computer as it can assist you in completing your 
routine tasks very efficiently and conveniently. However, it is often difficult 
to decide whether you should buy a traditionaldesktop or a laptop, considering 
your own specific needs. To make a well-informed decision, it can be helpful to 
first analyze the purposes for which you need a computer and then to identify 
which of the two suits your needs better.</p> 
<p>Here are few points you should consider while making a choice between a 
laptop and a desktop:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A laptop is smaller in size as compared to a desktop. Therefore, hard 
drives in a laptop usually have relatively smaller storage capacities than 
their desktop counterparts. So, if you need a computer for data storage, it is 
advisable to go for a desktop.</li> 
<li>If you need a computer for research, for taking notes, or for any other 
purpose that demands mobility, buying a laptop will be the better choice. Not 
only a laptop is movable, but it can also work on battery power giving you the 
freedom to work wherever you want.</li> 
<li>If your work involves graphic editing, animations, designing etc., 
choosing a desktop is advisable because of the larger screen sizes and 
flexibility of desktop monitors.</li> 
<li>With a laptop, you get all the peripherals built into the machine, which 
need to be separately bought in case of a desktop. This may be either good or 
bad depending upon your choice of peripherals and budget.</li> </ul> 
<p>When you are thinking about the items you should bring to college, your 
computer is a must-have on the list. However, the decision of which one to buy 
should be made based on your requirements as well as the economic feasibility 
of buying the most suitable solution.</p> <br>
