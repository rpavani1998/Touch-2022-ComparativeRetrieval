<h2> New laptop suggestions please? </h2> <br>

<blockquote> Hi folks, <br>
<br>
 I'll be getting a new laptop soon, but my 
knowledge on computers and understanding of what I really need is limited. I'm 
a bit lost and don't know which laptop I should get, could use some help.<br>

<br> I'll be going to college soon, so first and foremost, I'm looking for 
something that's reliable and built well. I'm really into gaming, so as far as 
I understand, I need a good graphics card, fast processor tons of RAM. That's 
about all I know. Can someone please recommend a laptop that would suit my 
needs as a student and gamer?<br>
<br>
 Since we're talking electronics here, 
can you also recommend a good racing wheel that wont cost me an arm and a leg?
<br> <br>
 Thanks in advance guys. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Buy a netbook for school, cheap as chips, and get a desktop for 
games at home. A good gaming laptop is a myth.<br>
 A basic netbook with an 
atom ion setup will be less than 400 bucks, strong and portable, and will play 
most games. You can use it at school, bring it home and transfer stuff into a 
desktop.<br>
<br>
 Whats your budget? <br>
<br>
 A basic gaming desktop, 
capable of playing any modern game but not about to win any competitions 
regarding frame rates etc, can be put together for about 400 bucks, then you 
will need a screen as well. Depending on how much you want to spend, and just 
how well you want the game to play, this can blow out to a couple grand or more.
<br> <br>
 Or.. you could buy a cheap laptop and just stick to PS3...

<blockquote> Go with an Intel i5 or i7 (7 is better than 5) with 6-8gb of ram 
and one of those fancy onboard 1gb-2gb graphics cards, it wont stack up to 
anywhere near as good as a gaming desktop pc but it will be pretty fast but 
heavy and expensive. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Thanks for the replies, I forgot to mention my budget is about 
$800 at max. In my opinion, it's a rather impractical idea to have 2 computers, 
a netbook and a gaming desktop.<br>
<br>
 A basic netbook is not enough for me. 
I do almost everything on the current family laptop, cost $1000 back in 07. 
Lots of web-surfing, many open windows, demanding games, movies, heavy video 
and photo-editing (Sony Vegas, Photoshop etc.). I'm thinking, since I'll be 
spending a decent amount of money on a good laptop, why not pay a bit extra for 
some gaming performance? ATI 5000+, i5 processor and at least 2 GB RAM.<br>
<br>
 Haven't got a PS3 or 360, and neither will be coming for a while. Long story 
short, the parents think games are completely useless and do nothing but kill 
brains. Once I'm in college, I'll have the freedom to get one... still a long 
way though. The reason I've got the chance to get a gaming laptop is they see a 
laptop as a useful investment.<br>
<br>
 To give yee an idea of what I'm 
looking for; I'm interested in the HP Envy, Dell XPS and Studio, and ASUS 
G-series laptops. </blockquote>

<h2> </h2> 
<blockquote> Ok, here's the rundown. This is my advice copied and pasted from 
another thread.<br>
<br>
<b>Macs</b> are a rock solid laptop, they are made 
from good hardware with a good OS, however, you pay for the 
&quot;top-of-the-line&quot; mentality. It is overpriced for what it is, but 
none the less, good at what it is designed to do. I really do recommend Mac's 
to people going into any sort of creative environment. Not exclusively mind 
you, but it IS what they are built for.<br>
<br>
 PCs, I am going to split into 
two categories, then further down into which models I recommend.<br>
<br>
 
PC-Windows is the widest used OS in the world, and something everyone knows how 
to use. It will come stock on most laptops. Avoid a netbook. Seriously. The 
screen is too small, the keyboard is too small, they don't hold #### all in 
terms of data. Get a laptop, something with a bit of grunt.<br>
 My personal 
laptop is an Asus. They are cheap, reliable and wonderfully middle-of-the-line. 
Don't expect fantastic things out of it, because you won't get it. Shit heat 
management combined with middle of the line hardware will be your boon, 
however, they are very reasonably priced and will still &quot;get the job 
done&quot;. Mine's been soldiering on for years, still a rock solid performer.
<br> <br>
<b>HP,</b> a good brand also. You pay a little more for them, but 
they seem to come with better hardware. They are also loaded with ALOT of shit 
software, so uninstall that with something like PCDeCrapifier straight away. 
The built quality of HP is a little higher too, so they tend to be alot 
sturdier also.<br>
<br>
 Avoid <b>Acer</b> like the ####ing plague. They tend 
to be over priced and like HP, come loaded with alot of shit you don't need. 
Their customer support is run by goons, their hardware breaks like my mates 
sister when she see's me walk through the door, and well, they're shit. The 
only positive I can really add here is &quot;impressive battery life&quot; 
considering they're running windows by default and considering well, they 
really are shit.<br>
<br>
<b>Lenovo,</b> formerly IBM, make a series of 
business laptops. My ####ing god, some of the best pieces of equipment you can 
buy...provided you are strong enough to lug them around. They will NEVER fail 
on you, and if they do, Lenovo customer support is run by the swiss. Or some 
shit. They will literally courier you out a whole new laptop if you know how to 
ask them right. Their hardware is rock solid, their software is reasonable, the 
drivers are strong, the customer support is good and even the battery life is a 
solid performer. The reason they make such good laptops is because they aim 
their services at rich executives with expensive suits, fast cars and 
(probably) small penises. Expect professionalism out of this company, but 
expect to PAY for it. The lenovo's usually sit around 300-700 dollars above 
most laptops, but it's a cost you will appreciate down the line. Also, they 
tend to pay maybe 500g-1kg more too, I would estimate. Just keep that in mind.
<br> <br>
 Now I'm going to have a plug for Ubuntu. Consider NOT using Windows 
on your PC. Seriously.<br>
<br>
 Ubuntu is a free linux distro which comes 
Jam-Packed full of fun shit which spans right across from hacking tools all the 
way to free photoshop alternatives. It sports longer battery like than Windows 
and well, with Gnome desktop installed, is really, really pretty. Got some cool 
features with facebook integration and automatic teaming up with windows.<br>

<br> Comes pre-installed with OpenOffice, a MSOffice style alternative. Can 
also rip songs right off ipods, recovery data off damaged hard drives or USB 
sticks.<br>
<br>
 Maybe dual-boot it, maybe run it exclusively, just give it a 
thought, it's a worthwhile OS, I run it in 3/4 of my computers.<br>
<br>
 Also, 
try NOT to buy from places like Harvey Norman or Clive Peters or something. Go 
to wholesale computer stores like MSY or Scorptech. (Avoid Centrecom). You will 
usually get a better deal. Less service, but a better deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I 
also hear good things about Toshiba, but have never dealt with them personally.
<br> <br>
 Also, there is some mention above of specs, which I didn't read. <br>
<br> Anyone who says you need 6-8gb is living in 2015. You can happily run 
Windows 7 along with photoshop and other movie editing software on a Dual-Core 
processor with 4gb of ram. Unless you KNOW exactly what specs you need for a 
particular program (Say, you're doing university and you use a particular 
modelling program or something) then you should stick to something like:<br>

<br> <b>Processor</b>: i3, i5 or the AMD Athlon or Turion. <br>
<b>Memory</b>: 
For future sake, insist on at least 4gb, but there's not much point going above 
6gb.<br>
<b>HDD</b>: Aim for at least 500gb. Unless you are playing hard core 
high end games and hate loading screens, avoid Solid State Drives (SSD). They 
are too expensive right now.<br>
<b>Video card</b>: It's not NEEDED, but my 
advice would be to insist on discreet graphics. Ask for a Nvidia card in your 
laptop, as in my experience they out-perform most, and are much more reliable. 
Try for something with about 1gb or ram on the card.<br>
<b>OS:</b> Avoid 
Vista, it's very shit. Avoid XP, it's coming to the end of it's life cycle. Go 
for Windows 7, but try to get Professional or Ultimate edition. Might cost a 
few extra bickies, but it has features which will save your sanity later, like 
the ability to turn off UAC (Annoying black &quot;DO YOU WANT TO RUN THIS 
PROGRAM&quot; screen&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Aside from that, I have a system I will 
suggest to you.<br>
<br>
 Available from MSY ( 
http://www.msy.com.au/Parts/notebook.pdf) is a Lenovo laptop. <br>
<br>
 CPU: 
Intel Core i5 480<br>
 OS: Windows 7 Home Premium <br>
 RAM: 4GB DDR3 <br>
 
HDD: 500GB SATA<br>
 Graphic:Nvidia G310M <br>
 1GB Dedicated VGA <br>
 Screen: 
15.6&rdquo; (1366x768)<br>
 WXGA Led Glossy <br>
 * 1yr Warranty * DVD Burner * 
USB2.0<br>
 * WiFi * Bluetooth * 6 Cell Battery * Web Cam <br>
<br>
 It's $749 
before cashback, with a $50 cash back incentive.<br>
<br>
 I highly recommend 
this laptop. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Thanks a lot mate! That's some seriously good information! From 
which thread did you get this?? I didn't know much about Lenovo laptops at all, 
but from what I've read seems they're very solidly built and made to last, 
which is a first on my priority list. I'm not sure about the Nvidea graphics 
card, I heard ATI is a better performer. If I can find one with an ATI graphics 
card I'd definetely consider it.<br>
<br>
 Tell me fellas, Nvidea or ATI and 
why?? Also, size isn't all that matters, the newer the better, so I heard. The 
graphics card is probably the most important when taking high-end games into 
consideration, so I need a laptop with a really decent one! </blockquote>

mate, I know that a desktop is better (and cheaper) than a laptop for gaming. 
But in my case, its very impractical to have a desktop. I'm always moving 
around the house and go out quite a lot. I'm practically stuck without a 
laptop. There are a few ASUS G51 J's lying around at my local electronics 
store, $750. No idea how much it should actually cost. Is this a bargain or is 
it over-priced??<br>
<br>
 I know that when comparing similar ATI and Nvidea 
cards, the ATI wins in performance, but the Nvidea excels in operating 
temperatures. Well, what the heck? What's wrong with burning my balls off for 
some good gaming experience haha! </blockquote>

ASUS G51J 3D gaming notebook review <br>
 
Very close, but without the 3D screen and an i5 instead of an i7. Seems that 
its Nvidea video card is not so recent... there's always something behind these 
bargain prices, outdated hardware and such...<br>
<br>
 My cousin recommended 
an HP Envy 14. Seen it, good specs (among the latest too) and reasonably 
priced. Not so sure, have you had or heard of anyone's experience with HP? I 
heard the Pavilions are basically a bunch of crapware in a casing, that's 
what's keeping me skeptical about HP.<br>
<br>
 As far as I've heard of Lenovo 
so far, looks pretty promising. Same goes to certain ASUS laptops. Alienware is 
generally too expensive, the M11x is underpowered, explained by the lower 
price. I'm not a big fan of Toshiba. I'm sharing a Tecra A8 currently with the 
familiy, don't like it, under-powered, painfully slow, hard-drive already 
crashed once. Is it a different story with the Qosmio?? </blockquote>

<blockquote> I had a HP until not too long ago, just got it back from the shop 
with fresh windows 7 and some more RAM installed, oh and also it was stuffed to 
the guys fixed it too since I didn't have my old CDs so I couldn't fresh 
install, cost around $500 and after a week my gfx card melted. My mate's HP 
also f-cked up, they get really hot &amp; I find they are just sh-tty laptops 
in general<br>
<br>
 I'm currently running a Toshiba Satellite A660 
(Discontinued for a few months now) &amp; my first one stuffed up within about 
a month, even less (the NUMPAD 4 key was acting as if it was held down) and 
after I got that replaced I have no trouble playing most games in high quality, 
good sound, after a bit of tweaking it's super fast &amp; I love it, but each 
to their own. My mate has the next model up (Qosimo or whatever) and his is 
roughly the same as mine in terms of gaming etc, I see no real differences 
except maybe his loads certain screens 1 second faster, which doesn't seem to 
matter, and the price tag (mine was about $1300 after haggling, his was around 
$2000 with no haggling).<br>
<br>
 Both my A660 and his Qosimo have never had 
HDD issues (apart from when we bump them, the HDD disconnects to protect it 
from damage but it doesn't really cause problems, just makes music go 
&quot;dzzrrrr&quot; for bout half a second), never have sound issues, or visual 
issues etc, massive resolution, decent screen size (I think they're 15.6 Inch), 
though his came with a bluray player whereas mine didn't since I have a 
bluray/dvd player &amp; 2 ps3's so I didn't need it for the extra $600.<br>
<br>
 Some features are turbo cpu, 4xusb ports w/ 1 being a super fast/high speed or 
whatever it is, tv aerial input, HDMI port, SD card port, touch-buttons for 
volume &amp; music controls etc, ethernet port &amp; standard monitor port 
(blue plug with the screws)<br>

<blockquote> Hold up. <br>
<br>
 You guys need to be careful about what advice 
you are giving out in relation to performance.<br>
<br>
 A laptop with 4gb of 
ram and ANY i5 processor, with a 1gb video card recent as of any time in the 
last 2 years will play ANY game on the market today, hands down, no questions 
asked.<br>
<br>
 Anything you buy above this is &quot;future proofing&quot; for 
anything else in the future that requires alot more. Don't buy into the hype 
that you need the LATEST video card to run the games. As long as it's got a 
decent clock speed, and a decent amount of memory, you'll be fine.<br>
<br>
 
Tell me fellas, Nvidea or ATI and why?? Also, size isn't all that matters, the 
newer the better, so I heard. The graphics card is probably the most important 
when taking high-end games into consideration, so I need a laptop with a really 
decent one!  As a general rule, Nvidia, simply because they tend to have more 
stable and reliable drivers. But that shouldn't mean you should discount ATI 
either, they often produce very good cards for sometimes a fraction of the cost.
<br> Again, don't buy into the hype that you need a brand new video card. Any 
nvidia card that has a model number of only three numbers (GT250, 330 ect.) 
will be more than sufficient without knowing the ins and outs of every damn 
card on the market. It may not be the BEST, but it will do the goddamn job, and 
do it well, and probably save you 100-200 dollars in the process.<br>
<br>
 
Also, some of the above mention Toshiba laptops. Good brand also, designed for 
business use. </blockquote>

heat?  You've never seen me near electrical devices :P Generally rule is if it 
survives me, it's indestructible. My guess would be since I have a lower 
end/spec one, and as it lacks a graphics card, much less heat to deal with. I 
have it on 24/7, on my lap, on my bed, everywhere- never overheated. Probably 
the best laptop I've played with for the price. PC User gave it a 90-95% rating 
or something. I really can't speak more highly of it.<br>
<br>
 Interesting, 
perhaps you got a dud one? Only I have heard good things about HP before, it 
may be your series had a fault. Sucks when that happens though, I had a Western 
Digital HDD, always been fond of them. Mine had a head crash 1 week out of 
warranty. Wooooooo for me. </blockquote>

<blockquote> 32-bit operating systems are only able to address up to 4gb of 
ram, or 3.4gb of RAM due to limits in their address space. (As a general rule, 
some OS's can overcome this issue).<br>
<br>
 A 32-bit address register meant 
that 232 addresses, or 4 GB of RAM, could be referenced. At the time these 
architectures were devised, 4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical 
quantities (4 MB) in installations that this was considered to be enough 
&quot;headroom&quot; for addressing. 4.29 billion addresses were considered an 
appropriate size to work with for another important reason: 4.29 billion 
integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in 
applications like databases.  However, 64-bit Operating systems support much 
more:<br>
<br>
 For example, the AMD64 architecture currently has a 52 bit 
limit on physical memory and supports a 48-bit virtual address space.[4] This 
is 4 PB (4 &times; 10245 bytes) and 256 TB (256 &times; 10244 bytes), 
respectively.  So, in laymans terms, a 64-bit operating system with a new AMD 
processor can support 4 194 304 gigabytes of RAM nowadays (Theoretically...).
<br> <br>
 I run a 64-bit cluster at home, which is virtualised to a single 
machine, running 16GB of ram and 3 CPU's, hyperthreaded. </blockquote>

<br>
 32 
bit operating systems can utilize a maximum of 3.3 GB of RAM. So even if your 
computer has 4GB of RAM installed, Windows will only read 3.3GB.<br>
 64 bit 
operating systems can handle well over 128GB of RAM. </blockquote>

 I'll be getting a new laptop soon, but my knowledge on

and don't know which laptop I should get, could use some help.<br>
<br>
 I'll 
be going to college soon, so first and foremost, I'm looking for something 
that's reliable and built well. I'm really into gaming, so as far as I 
understand, I need a good graphics card, fast processor tons of RAM. That's 
about all I know. Can someone please recommend a laptop that would suit my 
needs as a student and gamer?<br>
<br>
 Since we're talking electronics here, 
can you also recommend a good racing wheel that wont cost me an arm and a leg?
<br> <br>
 Thanks in advance guys.  Go down to china town and see what they are 
using. </blockquote>
