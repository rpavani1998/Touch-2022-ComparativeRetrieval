<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p> 
<p><em>Jan 4 2012</em> - Cyberpower makes a name for themselves by making 
affordable gaming PCs and the Xplorer X7-7500 certainly fits this. With its 
base price tag just over $1100, it certainly is much more affordable than many 
dedicated gaming laptops but it does sacrifice some performance to achieve 
this. Most notable, the graphics processor can't quite handle the full 
1920x1080 resolution of the display and the smaller battery pack limits 
unplugged gaming time. Still, the system does have some better aspects 
including some good customization options that can boost general performance 
without costing much and it offers a better range of high speed external 
peripheral ports.</p> 
<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Affordable 17-inch Gaming Laptop</li> 
<li>Two USB 3.0 and an eSATA Peripheral Port</li> 
<li>Wide Range of Customization</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Smaller Capacity Battery Offers Below Average Running Times</li> 
<li>Graphics System Not Quite Up To Gaming At Full Display Resolution</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Review - Cyberpower Xplorer X7-7500 17.3-inch Laptop PC</h3> 
<p><em>Jan 4 2012</em> - Cyberpower's Xplorer X7-7500 gaming laptop is a 
mid-priced 17-inch laptop that has a relatively affordable $1100 starting price 
and is based around the Clevo W170HN chassis. The company offers a wide range 
of customization options most of which will add features but will also add to 
the cost of the laptop.</p> 
<p>Powering the Xplorer X7-7500 is the quad core Intel Core i7-2670QM 
processor. This is a good overall choice for performance that does a very good 
job at gaming or even dealing with demanding non-gaming tasks like desktop 
video. If you want to save a bit of many and intend to use it primarily for 
gaming, then Core i7-2430M dual core processor performs nearly as well. One 
nice aspect of the system is the inclusion of 8GB of DDR3 memory that provide 
it with a very smooth overall experience in Windows and is nice to see over the 
6GB many companies are providing at this price range. One can downgrade to 4GB 
of memory to save a little money but frankly it isn't worth it.</p> 
<p>The base storage setup for the Xplorer X7-7500 is a decently sized 640GB 
hard drive. While it provides a good amount of space for applications, data and 
media files, the performance is a bit underwhelming due to the traditional 
5400rpm spin rate. Gamers wanting to have their levels load faster will be 
interested in either switching to the 500GB drive with the 7200rpm spin rate 
for the same price or paying a modest upgrade fee for a 500GB 7200rpmhybrid 
hard drive. Solid state drives are also available but they will heavily 
restrict the storage space or cost a lot more. A standard dual layer DVD burner 
handles playback or recording of CD and DVD media. It is possible to include a 
Blu-ray compatible drive but the upgrade cost is quite significant. Two newUSB 
3.0 ports are available for high speed external storage and peripherals. There 
is also an eSATA port that is shared with one of the standard USB 2.0 ports 
that can also be used.</p> 
<p>The laptop features a 17.3-inch display panel with a 1920x1080 resolution 
for full 1080p high definition video support. Like most laptops now, it comes 
with a glossy coating which can help increase the contrast but has the tendency 
to produce glare in certain lighting particularly in bight outdoor lighting. 
The graphics for the system are handled by theNVIDIA GeForce GT 555M which is 
just a step below the higher GTX class of graphics. This means that it should 
work fine for gaming but it won't generally be at the full resolution of the 
display. Instead, most modern games will have to either have detail levels set 
lower or the resolution lower which makes it a bit disappointing but 
understandable for the price range.</p> 
<p>One unique aspect of the graphics system is that it have two ways for the 
graphics to be switched between the dedicated NVIDIA and the integrated Intel 
HD Graphics. The first is theNVIDIA Optimus technology that will switch 
automatically to the dedicated graphics based upon predefined programs. The 
second is a user button that can be used to enable or disable the Optimus 
graphics switcher. This can allow the user to disable the auto switching and 
have it be fixed into a certain mode. This is beneficial for those wanting to 
use only the integrated graphics to try and extend the battery life.</p> 
<p>In order to keep the weight of this gaming laptop below seven pounds, it 
uses a smaller six-cell battery pack that features a 48.8 WHr capacity rating. 
This is a bit below the more typical eight cell packs found in many 17-inch 
laptops that feature around 55 to 65 WHr. In DVD playback testing, this yielded 
just over three hours before going into standby mode. Now, the actual running 
time if the system is used for gaming is going to be below two hours as that is 
extremely power demanding. More typical usage would yield under four hours. 
This is a bit below average for a standard 17-inch laptop.</p> Manufacturer's
