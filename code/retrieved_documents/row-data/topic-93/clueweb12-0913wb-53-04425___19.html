<h3> <strong>What is hard water?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Hard water is water that contains dissolved minerals such as calcium, 
magnesium, iron and manganese. Water naturally becomes hard as it moves over 
and through the earth to either a reservoir or into an underground aquifer.</p>
<p>Hard water is probably the most common water problem found in the home. 
Hard water can leave spots on your glasses and dishes, make laundry dingy, dull 
or feeling scratchy, and cause soap scum and scale to build up around showers 
and faucets, which makes cleaning a chore. Hard water also can build up, 
causing stains and buildup inside your water appliances, including dishwashers, 
washing machines, traditional water heaters, and new tankless waterheaters.</p>
<p>According to the Water Quality Association, water that contains more than 1 
GPG (grain per gallon) of these dissolved minerals is considered hard water.</p>
<p>Relative levels of hardness have been established:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Soft Water - less than 1 GPG</li> 
<li>Slightly Hard - 1 to 3.5 GPG</li> 
<li>Moderately Hard - 3.5 to 7 GPG</li> 
<li>Hard - 7 to 10.5 GPG</li> 
<li>Very Hard - 10.5 and higher GPG</li> </ul>
<p>The most common treatment for hard water in homes is an ion exchange&nbsp;
water softener. An ion exchange softener removes dissolved hard minerals from 
the water, and creates &ldquo;soft&rdquo; water.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can provide a complimentary water 
analysis to determine the hardness levels in your water, and recommend the best 
water treatment options for your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is soft water?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Soft water is water that contains few or no dissolved minerals, such as 
calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese.</p>
<p>Water softening involves a process called &quot;ion exchange&quot; to 
remove the dissolved minerals that can't be trapped by astandard filter. 
Softeners use fresh resin beads with sodium ions attached to the resin. As 
water enters the tank, dissolved calcium and magnesium are attracted to the 
resin. The resin &ldquo;exchanges&rdquo; the sodium for the dissolved chemicals 
and the water is then rid of these impurities.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can recommend a water softening solution 
to address your hard water problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is filtered water?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Filtered water is water that has gone through filters to reduce the amount 
of&nbsp;iron, hydrogen sulfide, aesthetic chlorine taste and odor as well as 
microorganisms, such as cryptosporidium and giardia.</p>
<p>Filtering water involves separating mineral particles, like particulates, 
iron, hydrogen sulfide or organic matter, from the water molecule (H2O). By 
passing water through a &quot;filter bed,&quot; or &quot;media bed,&quot; these 
granular particles are trapped &ndash; allowing the clean water to pass through.
</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can help you determine the type of water 
filtration system you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What are point-of-entry (POE) and point-of-use (POU) filtration 
products?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Point-of-entry (POE) water filtration products are systems that treat all 
of the water used in a home or single building. Culliganoffers a wide range of 
whole house filters that deliver cleaner water to every tap and water appliance 
in the house.</p>
<p>Point-of-use (POU) water filtration products are systems designed to treat 
only the water coming from the tap or water appliances to which it is 
connected. Culligan has a number of point-of-use drinking water systems, such 
as reverse osmosis systems, faucet filters, plumbed-in single tap filters, 
drinking water coolers, and drinking water filtration. These can often serve 
more than one purpose, most commonly filtering water for a drinking water tap 
in the kitchen, plus an icemaker or refrigerator line.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can help you decide which solution is 
right for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is reverse osmosis (RO) technology?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Reverse osmosis (RO) is a filtration process where water molecules are 
forced through a semi-permeable membrane under intense pressure. The 
semi-permeable membrane only allows water molecules to pass 
through,&nbsp;treating the water by reducing specified&nbsp;contaminants3
&nbsp;such as arsenic V, barium, chromium and radium 226/228 and 
microorganisms, such as cryptosporidium and giardia.</p>
<p>This technologically advanced process provides one of the most proven ways 
to filter water.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis filtration technology is available in the Culligan 
Aqua-Cleer&reg; system and point-of-use water coolers. Your&nbsp;local Culligan 
Man&nbsp;can recommend a reverse osmosis filtration system for you.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;Contaminants are not necessarily in your water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What are the benefits of a water softener?</strong> </h3> 
<p>A water softener removes the harsh minerals commonly found in hard water, 
leaving you with softer, mineral-free water that is much easier and gentler on 
everything that uses water.</p>
<p>With soft water, you&rsquo;ll see a difference all over the house:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cleaner sinks, and faucets with less crusty scale buildup.</li> 
<li>Less soap scum and stains in tubs, showers and shower doors.</li> 
<li>Brighter, cleaner clothes.</li> 
<li>Softer laundry, linens and towels.</li> 
<li>Cleaner, smoother skin and hair.</li> 
<li>New rust and dirty water stains are virtually eliminated.</li> 
<li>Reduced hard water buildup in your dishwater, hot water tank, and tankless 
water heater. This makes cleaning your home easier because you won&rsquo;t need 
as many harsh chemical cleaners.</li> </ul>
<p>Soft water is also better for your appliances and plumbing:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Appliances work more efficiently and last longer.</li> 
<li>Pipes are clearer with less corrosive elements and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
scale buildup.</li> 
<li>Appliances need less detergent and soap, which helps you save money and is 
better for the environment.</li> </ul>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can recommend the right water softener 
for your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What are the benefits of the Quadra-Hull</strong><strong>&reg;
</strong><strong> tank?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Culligan&rsquo;s Quadra-Hull&reg; tank is one of the strongest water tanks 
available on a water softener. The exclusive four-layer construction of the 
Quadra-Hull&reg; tank provides more protection than industry standard 
fiberglass and metal tanks. This design makes them impervious to rust and 
corrosion and they are UV resistant. Culligan's Quadra-Hull&reg; tanks offer a 
limited lifetime warranty on the tank and internal components.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can show you more about the dependable 
construction on every Culligan water softener.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is the Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Culligan&rsquo;s Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology maximizes the efficiency of 
your water softener.</p>
<p>The patented Aqua-Sensor&reg; system monitors the hardness in your water to 
determine exactly when your softener needs to regenerate in order to continue 
to provide you with soft water. This allows your water softener to use only the 
amount of salt you need. Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology can allow you to achieve a 
savings of up to two tons of salt and 20,000 gallons of water overthe lifecycle 
of your water softener.</p>
<p>The Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology is available on the Culligan Smart-Sensor
&reg;, Platinum Plus, Culligan Gold Series and Culligan Medallist Series&reg; 
water softeners.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can tell you more about the benefits of 
Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>How often do I have to refill the salt?</strong> </h3> 
<p>With regular use with moderately hard water, your water softener will only 
need to be refilled with salt every two or three months. Of course, if you have 
harder water then you may need to refill the system more frequently.</p>
<p>Culligan offers a Salt Service program where your local Culligan Man will 
provide regular salt deliveries and refill the salt for you.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can give you more details about our 
worry-free water softeners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is regeneration?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Regeneration is a process that &ldquo;recharges&rdquo; the resin beads 
after they&rsquo;ve become exhausted by removing the hardness minerals. The 
regeneration process restores the effectiveness of the resin beads, enabling 
the water softener to continue to create soft water.</p>
<p>Culligan&rsquo;s patented Aqua-Sensor&reg; technology offers a 
technologically advanced method to regeneration. The Aqua-Sensor&reg; system 
measures the hardness of your water and only regenerates when necessary. This 
exclusive option can result in a savings of up to two tons of salt and 20,000 
gallons of water over the lifecycle of your water softener.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can explain all of the advanced functions 
in a Culligan water softener.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>How much soap should I use with softened water?</strong> </h3> 
<p>With soft water, you can use a lot less soap and detergent in your 
appliances. A good way to adjust to the difference in cleaning efficiency is to 
use as little soap as possible. Try using a quarter cup rather than the cup or 
more that may have been necessary prior to the installation of a water 
softener. If necessary, gradually increase the quantity used to produce the 
desired results.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can show you all the benefits of using 
soft water in your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>Are there harmful effects of water softener discharges on 
household septic tanks?</strong> </h3> 
<p>According to the Water Quality Association (WQA), water softener 
regeneration discharges do not pose a problem to properly-sized septic systems 
or to the leach field. Studies* have shown that water softener regeneration 
wastes do not interfere with the septic tank system drain field soil 
percolation, and, actually could improve soil percolation, particularly in 
fine-textured soils.</p>
<p>*&quot;Home Water Treatment System Discharges to On-Site Wastewater 
Systems,&quot; J.F. Harrison, C.F Michaud, Water Conditioning &amp; 
Purification Publication, (12/2005, pp. 34-39)</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can tell you more about how a water 
softener system will work with a septic system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>Will softened water affect my lawn or garden?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Where the amount of hardness minerals in the water is only moderate (less 
than 200 milligramsper liter), it is doubtful whether the sodium concentration 
would be sufficient to be a serious hazard to plants.&nbsp; Most house plants 
require specific soil conditions for healthy growth.&nbsp; Many thrive best in 
slightly acid soils.&nbsp; If there is a high hardness concentration in the 
water being softened, the chances are good that ncessarily high hardness 
concentration of the soft water would be harmful to plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Distilled, reverse osmosis, or deionized water or rain water are 
better choices for watering plants to prevent mineral accumulation in the soil
.&nbsp; Or, if using softened water, water heavily to wash previously deposited 
minerals through and beyond the plants' root zones.&nbsp; Heavy sodium or 
potassium salt concentrations in the absence of calcium or magnesium may affect 
swelling of soils and retard the growth of plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For outside sprinkling purposes the use of softened water is, first 
and foremost, wasteful.&nbsp; Again, where the concentration&nbsp;of hardness 
minerals is heavy, the&nbsp;sodium salts replacing them might retard growth and 
might be sufficient to kill the grass.</p>
<p>Culligan water softeners offer unique bypass products that allow you to use 
your soft water supply for you and your home, not for your lawn, either at the 
softener or using Culligan's Remote Display.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>Should I use soft water in my humidifier?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Soft water provides for easier maintenance of a humidifier. When hard water 
evaporates, a hard scale forms that can be difficult to remove. Using soft 
water in a humidifier will only leave a light residue that can be easily wiped 
away. In addition, using soft water will help reduce the mineral build-up and 
keep the humidifier functioning properly. Please refer to your 
humidifier&rsquo;s operating instructions for more information.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can show you all the benefits of using 
soft water in your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What are the environmentally friendly benefits of soft water?
</strong> </h3> 
<p>The soft, conditioned water you get from a Culligan water softener system 
offers a number of environmentally-friendly benefits:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduces chemicals used around your house &ndash; sinks, faucets, tubs and 
showers come cleaner with fewer harsh chemical cleaning products.</li> 
<li>Minimizes dirty water discharge &ndash; dishwashers and washing machines 
require less detergent and soaps.</li> 
<li>Uses less energy &ndash; Culligan products are designed to be energy 
efficient.</li> 
<li>Decreases salt needs &ndash; Culligan&rsquo;s monitoring technology, 
including the patented Aqua-Sensor&reg; water softener technology and our 
exclusive meters, monitors water quality and only regenerates the system when 
needed, minimizing water and salt usage.</li> </ul>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can provide more details about all of 
Culligan&rsquo;s environmentally friendly products and solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What is the difference between the various kinds of bottled 
waters?</strong> </h3> 
<p>All &ldquo;bottled water&rdquo; is regulated by strict guidelines created 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to the FDA, water labeled 
as &ldquo;bottled water&rdquo; cannot contain sweeteners or chemical additives 
(other than flavors, extracts or essences) and must be calorie-free and 
sugar-free.</p>
<p>Other types of water are defined by the FDA as follows:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Artesian Water: Bottled water from a well that taps a confined aquifer (a 
water-bearing underground layer of rock or sand).</li> 
<li>Mineral Water: Contains no less than 250 parts per million of total 
dissolved solids (minerals). No minerals can be added to this product.</li> 
<li>Sparkling Water: Water that after treatment and possible replacement with 
carbon dioxidecontains the same amount of carbon dioxide that it had at 
emergence from the source. (An important note:&nbsp;Soda water, seltzer water 
and tonic water are not considered bottled waters. They are regulated 
separately and may contain sugar and calories. These types of waters are 
considered soft drinks.)</li> 
<li>Spring Water: Bottled water derived from an underground formation from 
which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth.</li> </ul>
<p>Your local Culligan Man may offer several types of bottled drinking water:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Drinking water &ndash; available in 20oz, 24oz, 1/2 liter, 1 liter and 1 
1/2 liter, 1 gallon, 2.5 gallon, 3 gallon, and 5 gallon bottles</li> 
<li>Spring water &ndash; available in 1, 2.5, 3 and 5 gallon bottles</li> 
<li>Distilled water &ndash; available in 1 gallon bottles</li> 
<li>Demineralized water</li> </ul>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can provide more information about our 
bottled water delivery service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>How much water should I drink each day?</strong> </h3> 
<p>Water is critical in regulating all body organs and temperature, and 
dissolving solids and moving nutrients throughout the body. Because water is 
naturally low in sodium, has no fat, cholesterol or caffeine and isn't flushed 
straight through the body like many other beverages, it's the natural solution 
to help reach your body&rsquo;s daily fluid quota.</p>
<p>How much water should you consume? Most adults need eight to 12 eight-ounce 
glasses of water or fluids daily, but needs vary by activity level, health 
circumstances (including pregnancy) and even by age. For example, a 60-pound 
child would need a minimum of at least 30 ounces of water a day, or about three 
to four glasses. But a 180-pound man would need about 90 ounces of water a day 
or about 11-12 glasses. And people may need more water as they age, since 
thirst signals may become dull, activity levels decline and prescription drugs 
may dehydrate their bodies further.</p>
<p>For more information about proper hydration, talk to your&nbsp;local 
Culligan Man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<h3> <strong>What are the environmentally-friendly benefits of Culligan 
drinking water?</strong> </h3> 
<p>A Culligan drinking water system and Culligan bottled water offer two 
environmentally-friendly alternatives to single-serve bottled drinking water 
that can benefit the environment in a number of ways:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Clean up landfills &ndash; your entire family can use fewer single-serve 
bottles of water and canned drinks, preventing thousands of those single-serve 
bottles and cans from ending up in landfills.</li> 
<li>Lower emissions &ndash; by using fewer single-serve bottles of water and 
canned beverages, you help reduce the emissions required to manufacture and 
deliver those bottles.</li> 
<li>Recycle &ndash; Culligan recycles or reuses the 5 gallon (18.9 liter) 
bottles used for bottled water delivery, saving even more landfill space, 
emissions and oil.</li> </ul>
<p>Your&nbsp;local Culligan Man&nbsp;can provide more details about all of 
Culligan&rsquo;s environmentally friendly products and solutions.</p>

<br>

<h3> <strong>What should I consider before buying a water treatment solution?
</strong> </h3> 
<p>&nbsp;Here are some helpful considerations you may want to take into 
account before purchasing a water treatment system:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do you have hard water? <br>
A Culligan water analysis will help you 
understand precisely how hard your water is and which solution will best 
address your water needs.</li> 
<li>Your water usage and pressure.<br>
The amount of water used as well as 
water pressure are factors to consider when fitting your home with a water 
quality improvement system. Household size may influence consumption, but 
different families have different needs. Every factor should be considered, 
including family growth and guest visits. Your Culligan Man will provide you 
with a recommended solution for your home and water.</li> 
<li>The real value of a &quot;quick fix.&quot;<br>
Inexpensive water filters 
and other standard solutions are tempting but may not be enough to solve your 
problem for good. Plus, a quality system may save you money because it&rsquo;s 
more efficient and requires less maintenance.</li> 
<li>Choose from a reputable dealer.<br>
Look for someone who not only sells 
water conditioning and filtration products, but someone who truly knows how to 
address your specific water problems. Your local Culligan Man is a genuine 
water expert who will be able to help you address your specific water issues 
with the right solution. Plus, with over 75 years of experience, you can trust 
that your local Culligan Man will be here to help you now and down the road 
with all of your water problems.</li>
