<h1>Indoor Succulent Gardens</h1> <br>

<p><b>Indoor Succulent Gardens</b></p> 
<p>During these cold winter months, the gardener inside of me still wants to 
work with plants. The holiday season is a great time to add a few permanent or 
temporary houseplants to your home. For most, buying houseplants are for 
decoration, but for many gardeners like me, it's therapy. In addition to the 
usual foliage house plants, typical holiday plants include the favorites: 
poinsettias, amaryllis, cyclamen and Christmas cactus.</p> 
<p>I grow a lot of succulents that aren't cold hardy in the Texas Panhandle. 
For the past several years I've been lucky enough to winter them over at the 
Amarillo Botanical Gardens in their bright and sunny gallery. A few I bring 
inside my home.</p> 
<p>Succulents can be wonderful winter houseplants and require light from an 
east or south facing window and little care. This seems like a perfect 
arrangement to me. From around November 15th  until February 15th the light is 
low enough in the sky and angles through the south side windows. I have a few 
rooms with good southern exposures that are perfect. Even an eastern exposure 
unobstructed by trees provide enough light to pull them through the winter. 
Counter space below a skylight or solar tube works good too.</p> 
<p>Succulents that are easy to grow inside include members of these plant 
families:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Crassulacea:</i> A<i>eoniums, Echeverias, Kalanchoes, Sempervivums</i> 
and<i>Sedums</i></li> 
<li><i>Cactaceae:</i> that is, the cacti with many and varied genera and 
species</li> 
<li><i>Mesembranthaceae: Lithops</i> and <i>Mesembryanthemums</i>, better 
known living stones and look like elephant toes</li> 
<li><i>Euphorbiaceae,</i> an extremely large family of plants from 
pointsettia, crotons, to plants that are cactus look-a-likes, but are not 
cactus, such as the pencil cactus,<i>Euphorbia turicalli. </i>Euphorbias have a 
milky white sap that contains latex and other substances that can be toxic and 
a skin irritant.</li> </ul> 
<p>These succulents and more are easy to find at nurseries and garden centers 
as well as on-line shopping. Prices range from about $2 on up, depending on 
size. They are easy to propagate from leaf cuttings. You don't even need to 
take a cutting. Often through handling, a leaf will become dislodged. Just pot 
this up by sticking it in the soil and keep it moist. In no time at all tiny 
root hairs will begin to grow.</p> 
<p>Dish gardens, shallow tabletop containers, make wonderful displays of 
succulents. Arrangements are only limited by your imagination. Group several of 
one type of plant, or a mixture. Include a rounded or mounding shape (<em>
Echeveria</em> or <em>Aeonium</em>), with a spiked or pointed plant (<em>Aloe, 
Agave</em> or columinar shaped cactus) with a draping or hanging plant, such as 
a<em>Sedum</em>. One dual purpose way to display succulents and keep them in 
their original container is by grouping them together inside a Woolly Pocket (
www.woollypocket.com) until the growing season begins again for planting 
outside.</p> 
<p>Decorating them for the holidays is easy by adding ornaments or winter 
sprigs to the container. Some people prefer desert motifs, or just a single 
succulent in a pot.</p> 
<p>Whatever your pleasure, your potting soil needs sharp drainage, that is, 
avoid soggy soil. Succulents will die very fast from over watering during the 
winter, as their growth is slower. They require little organic matter. Cactus 
and succulent mixes are available, but you may want to mix your own. Here's a 
potting soil recipe from Fine Gardening:</p> 
<p>5 parts perlite<br>
4 parts bagged potting soil<br>
1 part coarse sand<br>

Pinch of rock dust</p> 
<p>Top-dress the container soil with small river rock, gravel, aquarium stone, 
or a fine-grade roofing gravel to keep the crowns of the plants from rotting (
http://www.finegardening.com/how-to/videos/succulent-potting-soil-mix.aspx). 
Top dressing the container is a fancy term for mulch. I favor smooth black 
pebbles or colorful glass stones available in most craft and hobby shops.</p> 
<p>The Fine Gardening site recommends lowering the alkalinity of your water. 
Add one tablespoon vinegar (white vinegar will do) or citric acid to 5 gallons 
of water. The Cactus and Succulent Journal reported in the September-October 
2008 issue, that by adjusting the water's pH, growth is improved, mimicking the 
acidity of rain water to around 5.6 pH. They observed better coloring, better 
leaf structure and flowering in addition to faster growing than with using 
regular tap water, which is usually more in the alkaline range. Adding a bit of 
acidity to our city water for watering any plants is recommended. Follow the 
guidelines, don't over do it on the vinegar. If your water is more alkaline 
than most, adding up to 3 tablespoons of vinegar or citric acid may be 
required. If you are unsure of your water's pH, test with a pH meter, pH strips 
or call your city water department to find out.</p> 
<p><b>Warning</b>, you may become hooked on growing succulents. Becoming a 
member of the Cactus and Succulent Society will increase your scope and 
knowledge of succulents around the world leading to an expensive hobby. 
Information about joining can be found atwww.cssainc.org. Austin, Texas will be 
hosting the 35th Biennial CCSA Convention on June 15th to 19th, 2013. This is 
the closest city to Amarillo their convention will probably ever be held.</p> 
<p>Whether it's one echevaria or cactus or a greenhouse full, just have fun.
