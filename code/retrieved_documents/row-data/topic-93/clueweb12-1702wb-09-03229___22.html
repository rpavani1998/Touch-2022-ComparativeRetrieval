<p>First Ever US RWH Study Released</p> 
<p> First Ever US Rainwater Market Study Published. The report 
&ldquo;Rainwater Harvesting in the US: A 2010 Industry Analysis&rdquo; 
illustrates the sustainedgrowth of the rainwater harvesting market in recent 
years, even with the poor economic times. This 50+ page market study collected 
primary data from a survey of RWH installers throughout key states in the US 
and also conducted informal interviews with a number of RWH suppliers and key 
stakeholders to validate the findings. The authors also collected secondary 
data from the Internet, including the website of HarvestH2o, publicly available 
information from the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association (ARCSA) 
website, and other associations such as those serving manufacturers and 
suppliers.<strong>&gt;&gt; more </strong></p> 
<p>Passive versus Active Rainwater Harvesting</p> 
<p>There is wide spread interest in water conservation and specifically in 
capturing and reusing rainwater in both residential and commercial buildings to 
reduce costs, reduce the environmental impact of the building and lessen the 
load on the municipal sewer and stormwater systems in the arid southwest where 
droughts are a way of life.</p> 
<p>Harvesting rainwater from rooftops is one solutions to conserving our 
precious water, where it can be used instead of municipal drinking water for 
many non-drinking water (i.e. non-potable) applications (e.g. landscape, toilet 
flushing) as well as drinking water. There are two general types of rainwater 
catchment systems - &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot;. Most 
professionally installed systems incorporate aspects of both to maximize the 
water conserved.<strong>&gt;&gt; more </strong></p> 
<p>Rainwater Harvesting System Integrated into Home Design</p> 
<p>This rainwater harvesting (RWH) system, with an above-ground, 7,500 gallon 
(usable) poured-concrete cistern, used for both potable and nonpotable 
purposes, was designed and constructed in 2001 as an integral part of a new 
single-family home in Key Largo, Florida. Rain is collected from a 1,700 
square-foot white Galvalume roof and gathered in six-inch copper gutters with 
spash shields at roof valleys for occasional heavy downpours. Copper plumbing 
is used throughout the house as well. The reported pH of the annual test 
samples taken from an inside faucet has always been greater than 7, which could 
be attributed to the concrete tank. That does not explain why there seems to be 
no substantial copper leached from the gutters, since they are upstream of the 
tank. It remains for others to determine why the copper levels in the rainwater 
of this waterfront home are insubstantial.<strong>&gt;&gt; more </strong></p> 
<p>The Importance of pH</p> 
<p>In addition to its effects on biological and chemical processes, the 
variability of pH affects our decisions in domestic water usage. High-pH water 
often tastes bitter and may be an indication of the scaling potential of the 
water. Low-pH water may lead to the dissolution of pipes, particularly copper 
pipes. The EPA classifies pH under unregulated Secondary Drinking Water 
Standards and recommends a range between 6.5 and 8.5 pH units.<strong>&gt;&gt;

<p>Drought, What Drought</p> 
<p>For those of us paying attention to the weather in Santa Fe, a question 
increasingly coming up these days is when are we going to see watering 
restrictions? Especially since this is the driest it has been in a long time. 
Average precipitation for Santa Fe this time of year is normally 4.81 inches, 
and so far we have only received 0.67 inches, or 13.9% of average. It is worse 
for Albuquerque, which has seen only 0.19 inches thus far this year. Most of 
our state is experiencing a drought, as well as Arizona and Texas. Santa Fe has 
not seen this little precipitation since records have been kept. We should be 
extremely concerned about our water situation.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong></p>
<p>Water Rates</p> 
<p>In almost any place in the United States, we simply turn on the faucet and 
it flows. This amazing infrastructure was built over the last century and has 
supplied us cheap, plentiful water for decades. Abundant water, cheap 
electricity and a great road system have been the backbone of our economy over 
the last century. However, access to cheap, plentiful water is becoming a thing 
of the past, not only in the Santa Fe area, but around the country and the 
world. In the United States, we are fortunate to have accessible clean water at 
any price. Over 46% of the earth&rsquo;s population doesn&rsquo;t, and people 
in developing countries walk an average of 3.7 miles to get access to water. 
One in eight people on the planet lack access to clean water.<strong>&gt;&gt; 
more</strong> </p> 
<p>Water is Local</p> 
<p>Water is easy access and this has created an ideal for communities and 
local agriculture. In Santa Fe, where I live, on Garcia Street and the 
surrounding areas used to be farms not long ago. You can still see the sign for 
the old Gormley's trading goods store on Canyon Road, where local farmers would 
drop off their produce for folks from all around the area to buy. Of course, 
this store of bygone times is now a high-end art gallery, and its function has 
been replaced by the local farmers' markets. Water is local and will remain 
local. It has been the foundation of the economy for past decades and will 
continue for decades to come. It cannot be manufactured offshore, nor can it be 
outsourced. It is our most precious resource and it is the base on which our 
local economies are built. Even so, for most of us, water remains out of sight 
and out of mind.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong> </p> 
<p>Asphalt to Ecosystems </p> 
<p>Asphalt to Ecosystems is a compelling color guidebook for designing and 
building natural schoolyard environments that enhance childhood learning and 
play experiences while providing connection with the natural world. With this 
book, Danks broadens our notion of what a well-designed schoolyard should be, 
taking readers on a journey from traditional, ordinary grassy fields and 
asphalt, to explore the vibrant and growing movement to &quot;green&quot; 
school grounds in the United States and around the world. This book documents 
exciting green schoolyard examples from almost 150 schools in 11 countries, 
illustrating that a great many things are possible on school grounds when they 
are envisioned as outdoor classrooms for hands-on learning and play.<strong>

<p>ARCSA 2010 Conference</p> 
<p>The Texas capital shares another distinction as the indisputable crossroads 
of America&rsquo;s growing rainwater harvesting industry. Austin is where ARCSA 
was founded and where its 6th annual conference happens next month. Now, with 
over 700 members worldwide, ARCSA remains dedicated to promoting and educating 
the public on the safe harvesting and use of rainwater as an alternative for 
treated drinking water. This year&rsquo;s gathering features the largest, most 
jam-packed schedule to date. With keynotes by four internationally acclaimed 
experts, the conference will host over 40 presentations, many on topics never 
before addressed, and will include another 30+ exhibition booths with the most 
innovative and advanced products sure to advance our thriving industry.<strong>

<p>One Way To Conserve on the Ranch and Farm</p> 
<p>Agriculture and ranching consume a substantial amount of potable and pumped 
water around the country, and to some extent in Northern New Mexico. In some 
areas of the US, farms and livestock consume up to 60% of overall water use. 
This water is usually either clean, highly processed potable water or well 
water pumped from precious underground aquifers. This is not a great use for 
this water given that a cheaper, better and proven alternative is readily at 
hand. Rainwater is FREE and sometimes very plentiful even in the arid 
southwest; it is no wonder its use is growing for agriculture and for ranching 
purposes. Not only does using rainwater save processing and/or transporting 
water; it also saves energy and helps the environment.<strong>&gt;&gt; more
</strong> </p> 
<p>The Tale of Two Cities &ndash; Billions Conserved</p> 
<p>Albuquerque and Santa Fe have had water conservation programs for well over 
a decade, and both have been very successful. Yet their approaches to saving 
this precious resource in the arid Southwest are different. Since 1995, 
Albuquerque has reduced per capita use by 36%, Santa Fe by 42%. Santa 
Fe&rsquo;s water use is now substantially less than the US average, while 
Albuquerque is likely to fall below the US average soon. Both have made 
tremendous strides in conserving life-giving water. What lessons can we learn 
by comparing these cities?<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong> </p> 
<p>Safe Drinking for All through Solar Disinfection </p> 
<p>Every 8 seconds, a child dies from water related disease around the globe. 
50% of people in developing countries suffer from one or more water-related 
diseases. 80% of diseases in the developing countries are caused by 
contaminated water. Providing safe drinking water to the people has been a 
major challenge for Governments in developing countries. Conventional 
technologies used to disinfect water are: ozonation, chlorination and 
artificial UV radiation. Treatment to control waterborne microbial contaminants 
by exposure to sunlight in clear vessels that allows the combined germicidal 
effects of both UV radiation and heat has been developed and put into practice.
<strong> &gt;&gt; more</strong> </p> 
<p>Water &ndash; Another View</p> 
<p> Pumping more water or increasing water transfer from other areas is not 
going to solve this problem. Increased pumping and transferring water from 
further locations increases the need for more power generation and this 
directly translates into more power plants. For those of us who love our 
amazing vistas and crystal clear blue skies, the solution to our water needs 
can&rsquo;t involve polluting our skies. Clearly, we must look to other 
solutions to solve our water needs.<strong> &gt;&gt; more</strong> </p> 
<p>Rainwater Catchment System Pump Sizing</p> 
<p> Pumps are an integral part of almost all rainwater catchment systems; 
however, sizing a pump correctly is not straightforward and installers often 
fail to make the appropriate calculations. Much has been written on pumps for 
irrigation systems and for wells, but rainwater harvesting pumps can be 
markedly different. This series of articles is aimed at shedding light on the 
differences and assisting in properly sizing rainwater pumps. This first 
article will explain pumps and general pumping concepts<strong>&gt;&gt; more
</strong> </p> 
<p>Water: Why Care?</p> 
<p>I get a lot of blank stares when I start talking about water conservation 
and rainwater harvesting. Not among the folks who already do it here in 
Northern New Mexico, but from those who don&rsquo;t. The typical response is 
&ldquo;Why should I care? Water is cheap, and all I have to do is turn on the 
tap and it flows.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s true that water does flow easily, it 
is even truer that we have yet to pay the true cost of for this precious 
resource and that cost will only increase in the years to come.<strong>&gt;&gt;

<p>Washington State Department of Ecology Clarifies Water Rights in Regards to 
Rainwater Harvesting</p> 
<p>To the delight of the green building community and many other 
Washingtonians throughout the state, the Department of Ecology issued a policy 
statement issued on October 12th clarifying that water rights are not required 
for either the use of or the on-site storage of rainwater collected by a 
rooftop system or a guzzler (Guzzlers are devices used to catch and store 
rainwater and dew to provide wildlife or livestock with drinking water.)<strong>
&gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>Potable Rainwater: Filtration and Purification</p> 
<p>Rainwater harvesting is viewed by many, including the EPA, as a partial 
solution to the problems posed by water scarcity: droughts and desertification, 
erosion from runoff, over-reliance on depleted aquifers, and the costs of new 
irrigation, diversion, and water treatment facilities.</p> 
<p>Harvested rainwater in the U.S. is used mostly for irrigation; however, 
there is a growing interest in using rainwater for drinking and other indoor 
uses. Over 50% of household water is used indoors; bringing rain indoors could 
save the expense and environmental costs of treating and transporting water.</p>
<p>Can rainwater be made safe to drink? Yes. How safe? As safe as your well or 
tap water. How do you make it safe for indoor use? By filtering and purifying 
it.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong> </p> 
<p>Op Ed: The &ldquo;Greenest&rdquo; Roof is White and Metallic</p> 
<p>Among the goals of what are called &ldquo;Green&rdquo; roofs, vegetated 
roofs or roof-top gardens are reduced building energy costs and reduced 
urban-heat islanding. For both goals, white metals roofs are superior, 
particularly in the &ldquo;sun belt&rdquo; where cooling is a year-round task. 
If needed, the insulating properties of a vegetated roof can generally be 
provided underneath the roofing layer with radiant barriers or other 
insulation. But it can also be argued, particularly in the &ldquo;sun 
belt,&rdquo; that excess insulation blocks the advantageous nighttime 
building-cooling benefit of a metal roof. Insulation aside, this writer 
believes that the most important disadvantage of a vegetated roof is that it is 
designed to absorb water that should be collected to meet the needs of the 
buildings inhabitants.<strong> &gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>Ten Strategies to Promote Rainwater Harvesting</p> 
<p>In the 1980s and early 90s, most people, especially in urban areas were 
unaware of what rainwater harvesting (RWH) meant and why there would be a need 
to collect rainwater. It took an enormous amount of effort working with and 
speaking to local communities, organizations and state agencies to publicize 
the need for and benefits of RWH. Based on my experience with RWH during the 
past 20+ years, I offer the following strategies that can be utilized to 
promote the technology in your respective state or regions.<strong> &gt;&gt;

<p>American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association and the Dynamics of the US 
Rainwater Industry</p> 
<p>As the United States is being highly affected by the global recession with 
many industries shrinking in size; one industry is gaining momentum, that being 
the rainwater industry. Rainwater Catchment Systems in North America are 
rapidly increasing in popularity. This can be seen through the increase in 
membership numbers of the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association 
(ARCSA) and the increase in the activity through media channels, such as the 
New York Times, NBC News, National Public Radio and the Associated Press. The 
critical need for water resources has encouraged educational programs, 
university extension and research, plus municipal governments to address 
rainwater harvesting as a viable option to decrease shortages. This has 
increased businesses related to the rainwater industry and encouraged adoption 
of rainwater technologies by individuals and commercial enterprises.<strong>

<p>Bringing Green Home<br>

investigating products and working closely with the contractor, the 
700-square-foot (65-m2) home office now is in business.</p> 
<p>This new, old shed, includes a 1,600 gallon rainwater catchment system.

<p>Water Purification Technology: What is &quot;Green&quot; &amp; What is Not
<br> <br>
What constitutes sustainable or &quot;green&quot; technology in water 
purification systems? For a water treatment solution to be considered green, it 
must meet the criteria of not adding anything to the water and not using any 
additional water in the process. This article covers green technologies 
currently available and the contaminants for which green purification 
technologies are, and are not, an option. In the marketplace, there is an 
abundance of &quot;greenwashing&quot; of conventional technology and often a 
failure to disclose all the parameters of a purification system touted as being 
environmentally responsible.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>A Simple Rainwater Harvesting Design<br>
<br>
Australia mandates it. In 
Tucson&rsquo;s 100-plus degree summer days, one well-known harvester has 
created a natural cooling and humidity system using it. Earthships and 
off-the-grid builders need it to survive. What is it?</p> 
<p>It is the next renewable revolution: rainwater harvesting. If you ask 
old-timers and the Native Americans here in New Mexico, they&rsquo;ll tell you 
it is nothing new but merely coming to forefront as we take greater care to use 
our local resources in economical, sustainable ways. <strong>&gt;&gt; more
</strong> </p> 
<p>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly side of Roof Runoff <br>
<br>
One aspect of 
green engineering and sustainable design is how man interacts with the 
hydrologic cycle. This includes how stormwater runoff is managedand whether 
runoff is viewed as a waste product or an opportunity. Rainwater harvesting is 
a critical component in integrated urban water management. If rainwater 
harvesting barrels/collection tanks are widely distributed and used in 
conjunction with other water-sensitive development practices such as low impact 
development and/or conservation design, a substantial fraction of runoff can be 
removed from the drainage system. This, in turn, potentiallywould reduce sewer 
overflow events and reduce bacterial and other pollutant concentrations in 
receiving water bodies<strong> more&gt;&gt;</strong></p> 
<p>Spring Harvest: Rain Barrel Programs Sprouting Across US &amp; Canada <br>

<p>Rainwater Harvesting in the UK - Current Practice and Future Trends </p> 
<p>Rainwater harvesting (RWH), where nunoff from roofs and impervious areas is 
collected and utilised, is receiving renewed attention as an alternative water 
source. However, there are challenges to overcome in the promotion and 
implementation of RWH in the UK; it is a relatively unproven technology and 
there are still many concerns to be assuaged. Nevertheless, the situation is 
beginning to change with welcome moves coming from the Government, the UKRHA 
and housing developers themselves, in response to an increasingly challenging 
water resources situation.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>The State of Rainwater Harvesting in the U.S</p> 
<p>Rainwater catchment or rainwater harvesting (RWH) are catch-all terms for 
collecting, storing, and later using precipitation from rock out-crops, roofs, 
and other surfaces. Across the globe, rainwater is used for many purposes, 
including drinking water, irrigation, aquaculture, air conditioning, 
groundwater recharge, and fire fighting. It has been utilized for many 
centuries.</p> 
<p> Harvesting rainwater offers many advantages: it conserves municipal and 
well water; it is free; gravity fed systems conserve energy; it is low in salts 
and good for plants; and it can reduce flooding and erosion. Rainwater provides 
an excellent primary, supplementary, or alternative source of water. In terms 
of quality, it generally falls between groundwater and surface water. Rainwater 
can be used at multiple scales from residential to commercial and at the 
neighborhood or community level.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>San Francisco Welcomes the Rain</p> 
<p>The ancient practice of rainwater harvest is uncommon in urban areas that 
have municipal water services. Traditional infrastructure treats rainwater as a 
nuisance that must be disposed of as quickly as possible. However, San 
Francisco&rsquo;s Public Utilities Commission has set the stage for rain to 
become an important resource rather than a waste. The city-wide initiative has 
all the expected features - discounted rain barrels, how-to guides, and 
workshops &ndash; but that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Public officials have 
also laid the foundation for rainwater catchment to play a much bigger role in 
the city.<strong>&gt;&gt; more</strong></p> 
<p>Good Water Company Just Got Better</p> 
<p>Good Water Company, founded in Santa Fe, NM in 1988, is the oldest 
independent water company in Northern New Mexico. Water conservation was the 
highest priority in this renovation. All plumbing fixtures were selected for 
their efficiency including waterless urinals, dual flush toilets, and low-flow 
faucets. Additionally, a rainwater harvesting system was designed and installed 
to collect rain and snowmelt.</p> 
<p>It is the rainwater system that really stands out in the remodel. The most 
visible aspect of the system is the 20 foot tall, 8,300 gallon galvanized steel 
tank that dominates the back of the parking lot. But it is only the very tip of 
the system.<strong>&gt;&gt;more</strong> </p> 
<p>Rainwater Harvesting Regulations</p> 
<p>Rainwater Harvesting is exploding and so are the cities, states and other 
entities involvement with it. This artilce provides a state by state listing of 
past and current efforts dealing with rainwater and greywater.According to Bob 
Boulware, P.E., President of Design-Aire Engineering, Inc, Board member and 
Chair of the committee for ARCSA that is driving these guidelines, the United 
Nations and countries around the globe are concerned that in the next 10 to 15 
years, competition from the increase in the world&rsquo;s population, along 
with increased pollution of existing water supplies, will put such a demand on 
the world&rsquo;s available fresh water that instability of world governments 
may occur. This also means that a child starting school today, by the time he 
graduates from high school, will have trouble finding a clean glass of drinking 
water.&gt;&gt; more </p> 
<p>Pump Systems for Rainwater Catchment<br>
<em>by Verne Wood, CEO of PWS, 
Inc, Keaau, Hawaii</em></p> 
<p>Understanding how water gets from the catchment tank to the faucet can help 
people on rainwater catchment systems feel more comfortable with their system 
and be more self-reliant.</p> 
<p>A normal pump system is composed of a pump, a pressure tank, a pressure 
switch, and a check valve. These main components all work together 
automatically to supply pressurized water to your point of use.</p> 
<p>Catchment pump systems draw water from the tank, pressurize it, and store 
it in a pressure tank until you need it. There is a one-way valve called a 
check valve (also called a foot valve) between the water tank and the pump;

<p>Alternative Water Sources</p> 
<p>An excellent overview article on the different sources of available water 
appeared in a recent edition of the Environmental Building News (EBN). The 
article opens by drawing the case for &ldquo;alternative sources&rdquo; due to 
climate change, growing population and current unsustainable groundwater 
extractions. It then briefly mentions the need for efficiency and the different 
uses of water (i.e. potable and nonpotable), but then quickly dives directly 
into the review of the different sources of &ldquo;new&rdquo; water (e.g. 
graywater, rainwater, air conditioner condensation, mechanical equipment 
blowdown, treated wastewater, and desalination).&gt;&gt; more </p> 
<p>Residential Gutter Sizing<br>
<em>by Doug Pushard</em></p> 
<p>Gutter sizing is an aspect of rainwater collection that has been studied 
extensively and can be calculated based on published guidelines in the plumbing 
codes. With water weighing over 8 pounds a gallon, it poses a very real threat 
to a house and it&rsquo;s inhabitants. The weight of rainwater standing on a 
roof has caused many a roof to collapse, so the gutter/drainage system must be 
capable of draining the roof fast enough so that the structural limits of the 
roof are not exceeded. To determine system sizing alternatives, know the roof 
size that is to be drained. In a typical home with two slopes, each side will 
have gutters and be sized separately.&gt;&gt; more </p> 
<p>Harvest Rain - The Movie<br>
<em>review by Doug Pushard</em></p> 
<p>An extremely very well made DVD by The Cuenca Los Ojos Foundation 
highlights the connection of rain, surface water and groundwater; and how rain 
can actually heal the land if properly managed. The foundation works to 
preserve and restore the biodiversity of the borderland region between the 
United States and Mexico through land protection, habitat restoration and 
wildlife reintrodion. This beautiful 30-minute movie, is great for all ages, 
and depicts the changing of the land with the introduction of passive rainwater 
catchment, not in decades, but in just a few years. It is a powerful and awe 
inspiring visual testament to the art of passive rainwater harvesting.

<p>Rainwater Harvesting and Rural Development: The CIDECALLI Prototypes<br>

<em>by Femke Love Oldham</em></p> 
<p>This paper details efforts in Mexico to build prototype systems of various 
sizes that can supply fresh, clean potable water to households, farms and small 
communities.</p> 
<p>The average annual rainfall across the entire national territory of Mexico 
is 1,500 cubic kilometers of water. With only 3% of this quantity, there is the 
ability to supply 13 million people and 50 million animals with clean water. 
Additionally, this small percentage of the total rainfall would irrigate 18 
million hectares of crops.The broad and somewhat surprising potential of rain 
motivated the creation of the International Center for Demonstration and 
Training in Rainwater Harvesting (CIDECALLI) and the creation of different size 
prototypes to create solutions for local communities in Mexico. &gt;&gt;more

<p>Making Raingutters Work!<br>
<i> Why gutter protection should be standard 
on every home.</i></p> 
<p> At HPS we receive a lot of requests for information about gutters and how 
to best take care of them. Rain gutters are quiet but critical components of a 
building&rsquo;s roofing system. They have the important job of capturing 
rainwater at the roof edge then controlling and directing it away from the 
structure. Uncontrolled water running off the roof and blowing back onto the 
exterior surfaces can be damaging in a whole host of expensive ways including: 
flooding, foundation settlement, soil erosion, dryrot, paint damage, window, 
door and siding damage. &gt;&gt;more </p> 
<p>Conveyance - Simple or Complex<br>
<i> by Doug Pushard</i></p> 
<p> Conveyance, in a rainwater harvesting system (RWH), carries the rain from 
the roof (i.e. the capture system) to the storage tank (i.e. the holding 
system). Sounds simple, but it can range from being almost nonexistent to 
extremely sophisticated and attractive.&gt;&gt; more</p>

<p>Gentle Irrigation<br>
<i> by Ed Fenzel</i></p> 
<p>First, you need to identify the types of plants in your garden and their 
wateringrequirements. Next, you need to map out the irrigation zones by plant 
type and function - tree, shrub, groundcover - then note the category - 
ornamental, native, edible, or container plant. The technical considerations 
for a drip system are: I) existing pipe size 2) gallons per minute available 
(also known as your water volume), 3) p.s.i. (pounds per square inch) also 
known as your water pressure. Under ideal conditions, a 1-inch mainline with 30 
p.s.i. and 10 to 12 gallons per minute as your house water source will meet the 
needs of most homeowners for a drip system. The next, and certainly not the 
least important, decision is cost.more&gt;&gt; </p>

<p>First Flush Devices - A Review<br>
<i> by Doug Pushard</i></p> 
<p> What is a First Flush? Is there one perfect type of First Flush device? 
Where do I put a First Flush on my rainwater catchment system?</p> 
<p>First Flush or Rain Diverters, as the name implies, flush off the first 
water of a storm before it enters the storage tank. This is the water that 
could be the the most contaminated by particulates, bird droppings, and other 
materials laying on the roof. Eliminating these contaminants before they enter 
into your storage and conveyance system is critical to keeping rainwater clean.

<p>On the Verge of Water Scarcity<br>
<i> <strong>A call for good governance 
and human ingenuity</strong></i></p> 
<p> A 2007 paper published by the Stockholm International Water Institute 
overviews the current state of water around the world and recommends policies 
that governmental and private water companies should embrace to address our 
emerging water crisis. This report is excellent reading for anyone concerned 
about or involved in setting water policies. It is also good news for those 
involved in rainwater harvesting as rainwater catchment is seen as one of the 
solutions to water scarcity.&gt;&gt;more</p> 
<p>Water: Why Care <br>
<i> by Doug Pushard</i></p> 
<p> I must admit I get a lot of blank stares when I start talking about water 
conservation and rainwater harvesting. Not among the folks who already do it, 
but from those who don&rsquo;t. The typical response is &ldquo;Why should I 
care? Water is cheap, and all I have to do is turn on the tap and it 
flows.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s true that water does flow easily, it is even 
truer that we have not yet had to pay the true cost for this precious resource.

<p>Rainwater Harvesting - Pumps or Pressure Tanks<br>
<i> by Doug Pushard</i>
</p> 
<p>If you are building or planning to install a rainwater collection system, 
water pressure (i.e. water line pressure) is one of the main issues you need to 
think about. There one several ways to achieve water pressure when you turn on 
the faucet. If gravity does not work for you, you will need to install a pump 
and there are several options to consider, some new and some old.&gt;&gt;more

<p>Rainwater Harvesting &amp; Plumbing Codes</p> 
<p>Ever wonder why solar panels and solar hot water systems are growing at a 
much faster rate than Rainwater Harvesting systems. Maybe it is due to 
standardized electrical codes that provide consistency and training to 
thousands of electricians across the country; no similar standards exists for 
rainwater catchment systems.</p>

<p>Is Rainwater Really Safe? <br>
<i> by Doug Pushard </i></p> 
<p>Water quality is an extremely hot topic these days. With continued 
population growth and strained water supplies it is likely to become even more 
so. It is estimated that already one in five homes have some type of water 
filtration or purification system installed. How safe is rainwater compared to 
alternatives.more&gt; </p>

<p>Going Green is Building<br>
<i> by Doug Pushard </i></p> 
<p>There is a growing focus on controlling energy and monthly costs in homes 
and commercial buildings. Now, there is new emphasis on controlling water 
usage. In drier parts of the country, such as the Southwest and parts of the 
Pacific Northwest, freshwater sources are rapidly diminishing. This dilemma has 
influenced the building and design industries to create innovative methods of 
water conservation or so called &rdquo;water-cycle management&rdquo;more&gt;
