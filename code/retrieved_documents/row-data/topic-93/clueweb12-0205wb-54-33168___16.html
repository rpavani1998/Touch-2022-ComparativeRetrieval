<h1>Bottled Water: Pure Drink or Pure Hype? </h1> 
<h2>Natural Defenses Resource Council</h2> 
<h3>Executive Summary</h3> 
<p>More than half of all Americans drink bottled water; about a third of the 
public consumes it regularly. Sales have tripled in the past 10 years to about 
$4 billion a year. This sales bonanza has been fueled by ubiquitous ads 
picturing towering mountains, pristine glaciers, and crystal-clear springs 
nestled in untouched forests yielding absolutely pure water. But is the 
marketing image of total purity accurate? Also, are rules for bottled water 
stricter than those for tap water?</p> 
<p>Not exactly. No one should assume that just because he or she purchases 
water in a bottle that it is necessarily any better regulated, purer, or safer 
than most tap water. NRDC has completed a four-year study of the bottled water 
industry, including its bacterial and chemical contamination problems. We have 
conducted a review of available information on bottled water and its sources, 
an in-depth assessment of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all 50 states' 
programs governing bottled water safety, and an analysis of government and 
academic bottled water testing results. We have compared FDA's bottled water 
rules with certain international bottled water standards and with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules that apply to piped tap water 
supplied by public water systems. In addition, NRDC commissioned independent 
lab testing of more than 1,000 bottles of 103 types of bottled water from many 
parts of the country (California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, 
New York, and Texas). Our conclusions and recommendations follow.</p> 
<h3>An Exploding Bottled Water Market</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>There has been an explosion in bottled water use in the United States, 
driven in large measure by marketing designed to convince the public of bottled 
water's purity and safety, and capitalizing on public concern about tap water 
quality. People spend from 240 to over 10,000 times more per gallon for bottled 
water than they typically do for tap water.</li> 
<li>Some of this marketing is misleading, implying the water comes from 
pristine sources when it does not. For example, one brand of &quot;spring 
water,&quot; whose label pictured a lake and mountains, actually came from a 
well in an industrial facility's parking lot that was near a hazardous waste 
dump and periodically was contaminated with industrial chemicals at levels 
above FDA standards.</li> 
<li>According to government and industry estimates, about one fourth of 
bottled water is bottled tap water (and by some accounts, as much as 40 percent 
is derived from tap water) &ndash; sometimes with additional treatment, 
sometimes not.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Major Regulatory Gaps</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>FDA's rules completely exempt 60-70 percent of the bottled water sold in 
the United States from the agency's bottled water standards, because FDA says 
its rules do not apply to water packaged and sold within the same state. Nearly 
40 states say they<i>do</i> regulate such waters (generally with few or no 
resources dedicated to policing this); therefore, about one out of five states 
do not.</li> 
<li>FDA also exempts &quot;carbonated water,&quot; &quot;seltzer,&quot; and 
many other waters sold in bottles from its bottled water standards, applying 
only vague general sanitation rules that set no specific contamination limits. 
Fewer than half of the states require these waters to meet bottled water 
standards.</li> 
<li>Even when bottled waters <i>are</i> covered by FDA's specific bottled 
water standards, those rules are weaker in many ways than EPA rules that apply 
to big-city tap water. For instance, comparing those EPA regulations (for water 
systems which serve the majority of the U.S. population) with FDA's bottled 
water rules:
<ul> 
<li>City tap water can have no confirmed <i> E. coli</i> or fecal coliform 
bacteria (bacteria that are indications of possible contamination by fecal 
matter). FDA bottled water rules include no such prohibition (a certain amount 
of any type of coliform bacteria is allowed in bottled water).</li> 
<li>City tap water from surface water must be filtered and disinfected (or the 
water system must adopt well-defined protective measures for the source water 
it uses, such as control of potentially polluting activities that may affect 
the stream involved). In contrast, there are no federal filtration or 
disinfection requirements for bottled water &ndash; the only source-water 
protection, filtration, or disinfection provisions for bottled water are 
completely delegated to state discretion, and many states have adopted no such 
meaningful programs.</li> 
<li>Bottled water plants must test for coliform bacteria just once a week; 
big-city tap water must be tested 100 or more times a month.</li> 
<li>Repeated high levels of bacteria (i.e., 
&quot;heterotrophic-plate-count&quot; bacteria) in tap water combined with a 
lack of disinfectant can trigger a violation for cities -- but not for water 
bottlers.</li> 
<li>Most cities using surface water have had to test for <i>cryptosporidium</i>
 or<i>giardia</i>, two common water pathogens that can cause diarrhea and other 
intestinal problems (or more serious problems in vulnerable people), yet 
bottled water companies don't have to do this.</li> 
<li>City tap water must meet standards for certain important toxic or 
cancer-causing chemicals such as phthalate (a chemical that can leach from 
plastic, including plastic bottles); some in the industry persuaded FDA to 
exempt bottled water from regulations regarding these chemicals.</li> 
<li>Any violation of tap-water standards is grounds for enforcement &ndash; 
but bottled water in violation of standards can still be sold if it is labeled 
as &quot;containing excessive chemicals&quot; or &quot;excessive bacteria&quot; 
(unless FDA finds it &quot;adulterated,&quot; a term not specifically defined).
</li> 
<li>Cities generally must test at least once a quarter for many chemical 
contaminants. Water bottlers generally must test only annually.</li> 
<li>Cities must have their water tested by government-certified labs; such 
certified testing is not required for bottlers.</li> 
<li>Tap water test results and notices of violations must be reported to state 
or federal officials. There is no mandatory reporting for water bottlers.</li> 
<li>City water system operators must be certified and trained to ensure that 
they know how to safely treat and deliver water &ndash; not so for bottlers.
</li> 
<li>City water systems must issue annual &quot;right-to-know&quot; reports 
telling consumers what is in their water; as detailed in this report, bottlers 
successfully killed such a requirement for bottled water.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>FDA and state bottled water programs are seriously underfunded. FDA says 
bottled water is a low priority; the agency estimates it has the equivalent of
<i>fewer than one</i> staff person dedicated to developing and issuing bottled 
water rules, and the equivalent of<i>fewer than one</i> FDA staffer assuring 
compliance with the bottled water rules on the books. Although a small number 
of states (such as California) have real bottled water programs, our 1998 
survey found that 43 states have fewer than one staff person dedicated to 
bottled water regulation. By comparison, hundreds of federal staff and many 
more state personnel are dedicated to tap water regulation. Directing 
disproportionate resources to tap water protection is warranted. At the same 
time, over half the U.S. public (including many immunocompromised people) uses 
bottled water, and many millions of people use bottled water as their chief or 
exclusive drinking water source.</li> 
<li>FDA's regulations are less stringent than some international standards. 
For example, unlike FDA's rules, the European Union's (EU's) bottled natural 
mineral water standards regulate total bacteria count, and explicitly ban all 
parasites and pathogenic microorganisms,<i>E. coli</i> or other coliform 
bacteria, fecal streptococci (e.g.,<i>streptococcus faecalis</i>, recently 
renamed<i>enterococcus faecalis)</i>, <i>pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and 
sporulated sulphite-reducing anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, unlike the weaker 
FDA rules, the EU rules require natural mineral bottled water labels to state 
the composition of the water and the specific water source, and mandate that 
only one water label may be used per source of water. Similarly, recent EU 
standards applicable to all bottled water, also, are far stricter than FDA 
standards. FDA's standards for certain chemicals (such as arsenic) are weaker 
than certain World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Bottled Water: As Pure as We Are Led to Believe?</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>While most bottled water apparently is of good quality, publicly available 
monitoring data are scarce. The underfunded and haphazard patchwork of 
regulatory programs have found numerous cases where bottled water has been 
contaminated at levels above state or federal standards. In some cases bottled 
water has been recalled.</li> 
<li>Our &quot;snapshot&quot; testing of more than 1,000 bottles of 103 brands 
of water by three independent labs found that most bottled water tested was of 
good quality, but some brands' quality was spotty. About one third of the 
bottled waters we tested contained significant contamination (i.e., levels of 
chemical or bacterial contaminants exceeding those allowed under a state or 
industry standard or guideline) in at least one test. This is the most 
comprehensive independent testing of bottled water in the United States that is 
publicly available. Moreover, NRDC contracted with an independent data 
verification firm to confirm the accuracy of our positive test results. Still, 
the testing was limited. The labs tested most waters for about half of the 
drinking water contaminants regulated by FDA (to control costs). They found:
<ul> 
<li>Nearly one in four of the waters tested (23 of the 103 waters, or 22 
percent) violated strict applicable state (California) limits for bottled water 
in at least one sample, most commonly for arsenic or certain cancer-causing 
man-made (&quot;synthetic&quot;) organic compounds. Another three waters sold 
outside of California (3 percent of the national total) violated 
industry-recommended standards for synthetic organic compounds in at least one 
sample; but, unlike in California, those industry standards were not 
enforceable in the states (Florida and Texas) in which they were sold.</li> 
<li>Nearly one in five tested waters (18 of the 103, or 17 percent) contained, 
in at least one sample, more bacteria than allowed under microbiological-purity 
&quot;guidelines&quot; (unenforceable sanitation guidelines based on 
heterotrophic plate count [HPC] bacteria levels in the water) adopted by some 
states, the industry, and the EU. The U.S. bottled water industry uses HPC 
guidelines, and there are European HPC standards applicable overseas to certain 
bottled waters, but there are no U.S. standards in light of strong bottler 
opposition to making such limits legally binding.</li> 
<li>Summing this up, approximately one third of the tested waters (34 of 103 
waters, or 33 percent) violated an enforceable state standard or exceeded 
microbiological-purity guidelines, or both, in at least one sample. We were 
unable to test for many microbial contaminants, such as<i>cryptosporidium</i>, 
because the logistics and cost of testing for them post-bottling were beyond 
our means.</li> 
<li>Four waters (4 percent) violated the generally weak federal bottled water 
standards (two for excessive fluoride and two for excessive coliform bacteria); 
neither of the two latter waters were found to be contaminated with coliform 
bacteria in our testing of a different lot of the same brand.</li> 
<li>About one fifth of the waters contained synthetic organic chemicals 
&ndash; such as industrial chemicals (e.g., toluene or xylene) or chemicals 
used in manufacturing plastic (e.g., phthalate, adipate, or styrene) &ndash; in 
at least one sample, but generally at levels below state and federal standards. 
One sample contained phthalate &ndash; a carcinogen that leaches from plastic 
&ndash; at a level twice the tap water standard, but there is no bottled water 
standard for this chemical; two other samples from different batches of this 
same water contained no detectable phthalate.</li> 
<li>In addition, many waters contained arsenic, nitrates, or other inorganic 
contaminants at levels below current standards. While, in most cases, the 
levels found were not surprising, in eight cases arsenic was found in at least 
one test at a level of potential health concern.</li> 
<li>For purposes of comparison, we note that EPA recently reported that in 
1996 about 1 in 10 community tap water systems (serving about one seventh of 
the U.S. population) violated EPA's tap water treatment or contaminant 
standards, and 28 percent of tap water systems violated significant 
water-monitoring or reporting requirements. In addition, the tap water of more 
than 32 million Americans (and perhaps more) exceeds 2 parts per billion (ppb) 
arsenic (the California proposition 65 warning level, applicable to bottled 
water, is 5 ppb); and 80 to 100 million Americans drink tap water that contains 
very significant trihalomethane levels (over 40 ppb). Thus, while much tap 
water is supplied by systems that have violated EPA standards or that serve 
water containing substantial levels of risky contaminants, apparently the 
majority of the country's tap water passes EPA standards. Therefore, while much 
tap water is indeed risky, having compared available data we conclude that 
there is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap water.</li> </ul>
</li> 
<li>Other academic and government bottled water surveys generally are 
consistent with the testing NRDC commissioned. Though usually limited in scope, 
these studies also have found that most bottled water meets applicable 
enforceable standards, but that a minority of waters contain chemical or 
microbiological contaminants of potential concern.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Recommendations</h3> Every American has a right to safe, good-tasting 
water from the tap. If we choose to buy bottled water, we deserve assurances 
that it, too, is safe. In addition, whether our water comes from a tap or a 
bottle, we have a right to know what's in it. Among our key recommendations are:
<ul> 
<li>FDA should set strict limits (equivalent to those in California, EPA 
rules, international standards, or industry guidelines, whichever is most 
health protective) for contaminants of concern in bottled water, including 
arsenic, heterotrophic-plate-count bacteria,<i>E. coli</i> and other parasites 
and pathogens,<i> pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and synthetic organic chemicals, 
including chemicals such as phthalate, which can leach from plastic.</li> 
<li>FDA's rules should be overhauled and should apply to all bottled water 
distributed nationally or within a state, carbonated or not. To comply with 
common sense and a new requirement tucked into the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments, FDA standards must be made at least as strict as those applicable 
to city tap water supplies. The FDA should adopt rules for bottled water 
testing to control microbial and chemical contaminants, to protect water 
sources, to ensure the reporting of test results and violations to state and 
federal officials, to train and certify operators of water bottling plants, and 
to require the use of certified labs. In addition, FDA should do its own audits 
and monitoring of the quality of bottled water sold across the nation and 
should publicly release the results.</li> 
<li>Right-to-know requirements should require water bottle labels to disclose 
contaminants, the exact water source, treatment, and other key information, as 
is now required of tap water systems. If bottled water is so pure, why not 
prove it with full disclosure on the label?</li> 
<li>FDA's bottled water program and state programs must be better funded, with 
a new penny-per-bottle fee on bottled water to fund regulatory programs, 
testing, and enforcement.</li> 
<li>State bottled water programs should be subject to federal review and 
approval, and should receive federal funding from the penny-per-bottle fee 
recommended above.</li> 
<li>If FDA fails within 18 months to make its bottled water rules and its 
regulatory oversight and enforcement at least as stringent as those for tap 
water, the bottled water regulatory program and funding for it (including the 
proceeds from a penny-per-bottle fee) should be transferred to EPA. We 
recommend this transfer with some trepidation, in light of EPA's 
less-than-perfect tap water program and its own serious resource constraints. 
We conclude, however, that it would be hard for EPA authority to be worse than 
FDA's seriously deficient program, and that a transfer of funding for bottled 
water supervision to EPA from FDA would help. Clearly EPA has more resources 
dedicated to drinking water and has adopted stricter rules and oversight of 
state programs than FDA has. More stringent EPA tap water rules should be 
applied to bottled water within six months after transfer of authority.</li> 
<li>A credible independent third-party-nongovernmental organization should 
establish a &quot;certified safe&quot; bottled water program that is truly 
open, ensures full compliance with all FDA, EPA, state, industry, and 
international standards and guidelines, does twice-a-year surprise inspections, 
documents sufficient source protection and treatment to meet EPA/Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for<i>cryptosporidium</i>-safe 
bottled water, and makes readily available (including on the Web) all 
inspections and monitoring results. Currently neither NSF nor International 
Bottled Water Association certifications have sufficiently stringent criteria, 
nor are they sufficiently independent of the industry, to provide consumer 
confidence that such strict standards are met. Immune-compromised or other 
vulnerable people particularly may want such certification to be fully 
confident of their bottled water's purity.</li> 
<li>While we reasonably may choose to use bottled water for convenience, 
taste, or as a temporary alternative to contaminated tap water, it is no 
long-term national solution to this problem. Bottled water sometimes is 
contaminated, and we don't use it to bathe, shower, etc. &ndash; major routes 
of exposure for some tap water contaminants. A major shift to bottled water 
could undermine funding for tap water protection, raising serious equity issues 
for the poor. Manufacture and shipping of billions of bottles causes 
unnecessary energy and petroleum consumption, leads to landfilling or 
incineration of bottles, and can release environmental toxins. The long-term 
solution to our water woes is to fix our tap water so it is safe for everyone, 
and tastes and smells good.</li> </ul>
