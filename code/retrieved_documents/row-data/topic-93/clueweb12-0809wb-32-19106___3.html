Drinking Rain Water</strong> 
<pre>Name: Joe Status: N/A Age: old Location: N/A Country: N/A Date: 2000-2001 
</pre>  Question:  Why can't I drink rain water? <br>
<br>
 Replies:  Joe, <br>

<br> Normally you could drink rainwater without becoming ill. However, 
rainwater contains pollutants, soil, plant parts, insect parts, bacteria, 
algae, and sometimes radioactive materials that the rain/snow has washed out of 
the air. If filtered with one of the filtering systems that you can buy in 
stores nowadays, and then boiled, you could probably drink the water safely. 
However, it is safer yet to get your water from municipal water supplies or 
from wells that are frequently tested.<br>

 Since ancient times, the only sources of natural 
water that are recognized as safe to drink are rain water and water from deep 
wells. The trick is that the rain water must be carefully handled so that it 
does not become contaminated. If it runs along the ground, it's anybody's guess 
what sort of microbes and toxic elements it will pick up. But if you put a 
clean bowl out in the rain to collect the rain water, there's no reason you 
can't drink the water from it.<br>

 Hi 
Joe,<br>
<br>
 The only reason I could think of where you can't drink rain 
water is if you have no mouth.<br>
<br>
 OK, enough joking. In some third world 
nations, they drain rooftop rain gutters into barrels to collect water for 
drinking. Rain water might be a little bit acid compared to water out of the 
ground or from rivers, which are somewhat neutralized from contact with 
minerals, so you'd be missing some of those minerals.<br>
<br>
 If you live in 
a really polluted city, it might be a good idea not to drink rain when it just 
starts, as it's washing out all the particulate material in the air (car 
exhaust, diesel fumes, dust, etc). Other than that, I can't think of why you 
shouldn't be drinking it.<br>

 There is no essential reason 
why you can't drink rain water. I think the concern about drinking rain water 
has to do with the fact that in our non-pristine environment the raindrops may 
have picked up some contaminant on the way down from the clouds.<br>

 Dear Joe- <br>
<br>
 Most likely, you ARE drinking rain 
water..! The water that comes from the tap in your home at some point in the 
past fell as rain water (or snow). It may have flowed into the ground to become 
part of the groundwater supply, or may have arrived in resevoirs via rivers and 
streams. Usually this water is treated to remove impurities and harmful 
organisms.<br>
<br>
 But you can collect rainfall and drink it also. It should 
be collected and handled under sterile conditions, however. Much of the world's 
water supply, especially in the tropics, comes from rain water.<br>
