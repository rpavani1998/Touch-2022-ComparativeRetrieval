<h1>Building Pests</h1> 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>Buildings provide warm, sheltered, and occasionally moist environment for a 
variety of living organisms. In addition, the building, or its contents or 
occupants may also provide a supply of food. Such organisms can cause damage to 
buildings or inconvenience to building occupants. Pest organisms range from 
spiders to sycamore trees, from feral cats to fungi, and from the greater 
spotted woodpecker to the more infamous lesser spotted lead nicker. In most 
cases, exclusion and environmental control are preferred methods of dealing 
with the problem. Occasionally, more drastic measures may need to be taken, but 
legal restrictions should be borne in mind, and also the need to protect the 
health of the building occupants.</p>

<h2>Insects: miscellaneous</h2> 
<h3>Beetles</h3> 
<h4>Weevils</h4> 
<p>Weevil infestations are a consequence of fungal infection and like fungal 
infections they are eradicated by drying out and ventilation. However, weevil 
infestation increases the structural damage caused by the fungus. Where it is 
expected that the wood will remain damp, it may be protected by a suitable 
fungicide-insecticide treatment</p> 
<h4><em>Euophyryum confine</em></h4> 
<h4><em>Euophyryum rufum</em></h4> 
<p>Euophyryum rufum is similar to Euophyryum confine and is also a native of 
New Zealand. It is widely distributed throughout Britain</p> 
<h4><em>Pentarthrum huttoni</em></h4> 
<p>Pentarthrum huttoni is an indigenous species and widespread in Britain and 
Ireland. Brownish to pitch black in colour it is 3 to 5mm long. Attacking damp, 
partially decayed timber (usually involving Coniophora cerebella), the larvae 
burrow for about six months in the wood, before pupating. The flight holes are 
ragged and irregular and are inclined at 45 degrees to the surface of the wood.
</p> 
<h4>Oak longhorn beetle, <em>Phymatodes testaceus</em></h4> 
<p>This beetle lives entirely on bark and is harmless. It lays its eggs only 
under the bark of newly felled oak, chestnut or other hardwood. If this bark is 
not completely removed the wood is used in building, oval flight holes are 
produced, resembling those of the House Longhorn beetle.</p> 
<h4>Bark beetle, <em>Ernobius mollis</em></h4> 
<p>The bark beetle, 3 to 6mm long and light yellowish brown in colour, is 
sometimes mistaken for the Death-watch beetle. Originating in northern Europe, 
the beetle is now distributed worldwide. The larvae tunnel in the sapwood of 
newly felled coniferous timber, being found up to 50mm from the bark, and 
consequently end up in timber used for building purposes. After pupating, the 
adult beetle tunnels to the surface, making a flight hole 2mm in diameter. 
Building timber is not re-infected and apart from correct identification no 
action needs to be taken in response to the adult beetle's emergence.</p> 
<h4>Ptilinus pectinicornis</h4> 
<p>Common throughout Europe and the middle east, this insect is not much seen 
in Britain. It is reddish in colour and about 3mm long, and like the woodworm 
beetle, it causes damage to dry wood. An infestation resembles that caused by 
the Woodworm beetle.</p> 
<h4>Spider beetles, <em>Ptinus spp</em></h4> 
<p>Voracious and omnivorous, these beetles have long spindly legs and a 
constriction in the thorax, giving them a superficial resemblance to spiders.
</p> 
<h4><em>Ptinus tectus</em></h4> 
<p>Ptinus tectus is said to have originated in Tasmania, but has now spread 
worldwide, particularly in the colder regions. Unable to survive above 28 
degrees celcius, it remains active down to 2 degrees. 3.5 to 4mm long, the 
beetle is a dull reddish colour. The larvae eat almost any type of dry, stored 
food, as well as carpets and furs. In dwellings, the beetles live on food and 
other organic debris, frequently hiding between floorcoards, and sometimes 
emerging in large numbers. Mainly confined to towns.</p> 
<h4><em>Ptinus fur</em></h4> 
<p>Ptinus fur is an indigenous species found mainly in the rotting bark of old 
broad leaved trees. 3 to 4.5mm long and rusty brown, it will eat almost any 
organic matter of vegetable origin - stored food, paper, old fabrics, cork, 
decayed wood, sawdust or woodshaving. Infestation often starts in birds' nests 
in and around buildings.</p> 
<h4>Deathwatch beetle, <em>Xestobium rufovillosum</em></h4> 
<p>Reddish brown, 8 to 10 mm long, with patches of short stiff yellow hairs. 
Often has dust from emergence hole sticking to it, obscuring red-brown colour. 
Infestation indicated by perfectly circular flight holes and by circular bun 
shaped pellets of wood dust. Adult stage lives less than six weeks, larvae 
remain in wood for 3 to 10 years. Outside the sapwood, the beetle only attacks 
wood which has been previously decayed by the fungus Coniophora cerebella. In 
Winchester Cathedral, an infestation followed after damp-related decay by 
another fungus, Phellinus megaloporus.</p> 
<h4>Steely blue beetle, <em>Korynetes caeruleus</em></h4> 
<p>Bright steely blue beetle, predator of the deathwatch beetle, and slightly 
smaller. Indicates the presence of deathwatch infestations, and may also be 
used for biological control.</p> 
<h4>House longhorn beetle, <em>Hylotrupes bajalus</em></h4> 
<p>Adults black or dull brown beetle, 10-20mm long, grey patches of hair on 
wing covers, smooth central line with shiny bumps either side. Emerges from 
infected timber from July to October.</p> 
<p>Larvae up to 30mm long, straight, pale cream, three small black dots on 
either side of mouth.</p> 
<p>Found in sapwood of most softwood. Infestations mostly in area around 
Surrey and SW London, where the Building Regulations stipulate treatment of 
timber intended to prevent the further spread of the insect. Infestations may 
be recognised by oval, 6mm to 10mm oval, often ragged emergence holes. The bore 
dust consists of gritty-feeling cream, sausage shaped pellets. Larval activity 
may occasionally be audible as a scraping sound. Badly infected timber should 
be removed and burned.</p> 
<p> Note: Details of all suspected outbreaks of House longhorn beetle should 
be reported to the Building Research Establishment's Timber and Protection 
Division, Princes Risborough, Bucks, where records are maintained of all 
infestations in Britain.</p>

</p> 
<h3>Flies</h3> 
<h4>Mosquitoes</h4> 
<p>There are two groups of mosquitoes, culcicine and anopheline, the larval 
stages of both are spent in stagnant water. At best, these insects are a 
serious nuisance, and several species are vectors for a number of diseases</p> 
<p>With climatic warming, increasing frequency of overseas travel, and 
decreasing effectiveness of both anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, the 
importance of eliminating breeding sites for mosquitoes cannot be over-stressed.
</p> 
<h5>Aquatic larvae</h5> 
<p>The larval stages of mosquitoes develop in stagnant water and live by 
filtering micro-organisms living in the water. Any temporary ponding may be 
used for breeding; bottles, cans, gutters, rainwater butts, old tyres etc. 
Removal of water containing rubbish can greatly reduce the numbers of urban 
mosquitoes. Covering the surface of necessary still water such as water butts 
inhibits egg laying and removing light inhibits micro-organism growth and hence 
reduces larval growth. Eggs, once laid, can remain dormant for months if the 
water dries up. Mosquito larvae, when disturbed, move in a characteristic 
jerking, curling movement.</p> 
<h5>Culicine mosquitoes</h5> 
<p>Culicine mosquitoes are represented in Britain by <em>Culex pipiens</em> and
<em>Theobaldia annulata</em>. <em>Culex pipiens </em>commonly seeks shelter in 
buildings, but rarely attacks humans.<em>Theobaldia</em> is one of the largest 
mosquitoes and has a particularly painful bite which often becomes inflamed. 
Mosquitoes of this group do not appear to transmit disease in Britain, but in 
the tropics they are vectors for yellow fever, dengue fever and filariasis. The 
adults rest with their abdomens parallel to the wall and the larvae hang down 
from the water surface.</p> 
<h5>Anopheline mosquitoes</h5> 
<p>Anopheline mosquitoes, represented in Britain by <em>Anopheles maculipennis
</em> are vectors for malaria. Malaria is rare in Britain and is mainly seen in 
people recently arrived from overseas, but was endemic in East Anglia and 
elsewhere until the 17th century. Adults in this group rest with their abdomens 
pointing away from the wall. Larvae at rest in water lie with their bodies 
parallel to the surface.</p> 
<h4>Control of mosquitoes</h4> 
<p>There are three approaches to mosquito control; removal of breeding sites, 
destruction of larvae, destruction of adults, and deterring the insects from 
biting.</p> 
<h5>Eliminate breeding sites</h5> 
<p>Mosquitos have a range of several kilometres, and have an extremely 
sensitive sense of smell. While the individual householder may have little 
control over land use over the surronding area, every bit helps. Eliminate open 
stagnant water, or at least prevent aerial access to it. Examples include 
ponding in gutters, water cisterns, stagnant streams, bogs and drains. 
Rainwater collecting in discarded tyres is said to be one of the commonest 
breeding sites in South Africa.</p> 
<p>Where stagnant water can neither be covered nor drained, stocking with 
predators such as fish should be considered. However, it should be noted that 
fish may be affected by insecticides, particularly the pyrethroids. As a last 
resort, pouring oil onto the water surface is said to block the larval 
breathing tube, and prevent them from adhering to the water surface.</p> 
<h5>Insecticides</h5> 
<p>Destruction of larvae by insecticides is not recommended as relatively 
large amounts of insecticide are needed to obtain a lethal concentration. This 
not only causes pollution, it tends to encourage the development of resistant 
strains. However, adult mosquitoes frequently enter buildings, either in search 
of victims, or in order to shelter, and fumigation or insecticide sprays may 
then be useful.</p> 
<h5>Physical destruction</h5> 
<p>Mosquitoes at night are strongly attracted to short wavelength light, green 
to ultra-violet. They are also attracted by butyric acid, reportedly the smell 
of smelly feet. Insects so attracted may be destroyed by electrocution, a 
rapidly spinning blade, by sticky fly papers, or even by insecticide.</p>

<h3>Other flies</h3> 
<h4>Hover flies</h4> 
<p>Harmless or beneficial insects, often disguised to look like wasps or 
bumble bees. The black, bee-like Eristalis tenax, lays its eggs in stagnant 
water containing rotting animal or vegetable matter, eg in drains, gutters and 
sewage disposal pits. The eggs hatch into 'rat tail maggots' which suspend 
themselves from the water surface by means of a breathing tube attached to the 
posterior part of the abdomen.</p> 
<h4>House flies, <em>Musca domestica</em></h4> 
<p>Associated the world over with human habitation, the house fly creates 
great annoyance and some threat to health. The adults, because they feed on a 
wide range of food ranging from sugar to dung, are passive vectors of 
pathogens. The larvae develop in decaying foodstuffs, preferably in warm places 
up to a temperature of 50 degrees celsius. The larvae, when fully fed, burrow 
in soil for up to 50m to find a cool dry place to pupate.</p> 
<h4>Face fly, <em>Musca autumnalis</em></h4> 
<p>Cattle pest which feeds on secretions from the eyes, nose and mouth of 
cattle, as well as any sweat or blood from wounds or scratches. The larvae 
develop in animal dung. The adults can be a pest in buildings when they 
hibernate in large numbers in roof voids, walls and other spaces.</p> 
<h4>Cluster fly, <em>Pollenia rudis</em></h4> 
<p>Recognisable by the furry golden hair on its thorax, the adult cluster fly 
is in itself completely harmless. The larvae are parasites of earthworms. 
However, in rural and semi-rural areas, the flies enter buildings and building 
spaces in huge numbers at night, and in the autumn to hibernate. When the flies 
wake in response to warmer conditions, they can cause considerable annoyance, 
and by falling into unprotected tanks they can foul the water supply.</p> 
<h4>Lesser house fly, <em>Fannia canicularis</em></h4> 
<p>Similar to the common house fly, but smaller, this fly is very common 
throughout Europe. Its larvae develop in animal dung. It has not been shown to 
spread any particular disease, but its habits are similar to those of the 
common house fly, and it must therefore be regarded as a health hazard. A 
peculiarity of the species is that the males fly backwards and forwards in 
short, jerky movements eg around a light fitting. They can keep this up for 
hours</p> 
<h4>Bluebottles, <em>Calliphora vomitoria</em></h4> 
<p>Bluebottles, recognisable by their large size (8 to 14mm), bluish tinge and 
bristly bodies, only enter buildings in order to lay their eggs on meat. Their 
maggots may appear after migrating from roof spaces etc, where they may have 
been feeding on the carcases of pigeons, rats or other vermin</p> 
<h4>Greenbottles, <em>Lucilia spp</em></h4> 
<p>Like the bluebottle, these flies, only enter buildings in search of animal 
matter on which to lay their eggs. Greenbottle larvae have been found in 
unhealed wounds both in humans and livestock.</p> 
<p>back to top?<br>
</p> 
<h3>Bugs</h3> 
<h4>Bedbug, <em>Cimex lectularius</em></h4> 
<p>Originating in the middle east, the bedbug is now found around the world. 
The adult is about 6mm long, leaf like, its colour varying from amber to red or 
mahogany colour. There are no wings, but the legs are well developed. The 
larval stages are smaller and more translucent versions of the adult.</p> 
<h4>Natural history</h4> 
<p>Bedbugs in the daytime hide in cracks in buildings and furniture and emerge 
at night time to find a human or animal host. They puncture the skin and drink 
up to four times their own volume of blood. When alarmed they emit a noxious 
odour, which combined with the smell of an unhygienic bedroom is particularly 
nauseating. The bugs leave characteristic speckled brown or black deposits of 
faecal matter around their hiding places</p> 
<h4>Control</h4> 
<p>Bedbugs and their eggs are killed by very high or low temperatures - 2 
hours at -17 degrees celsius or 1 hour at 45 degress celsius. Eggs and immature 
bugs die off after 30 to 60 days below 9 degrees celsius, but adults are not 
much affected, although largely dormant. Insecticides, eg pyrethroids are 
effective against bedbugs, provided that it can reach the crevices where the 
insects hide. Ants, spiders, false scorpions and assasin bugs are enthusiastic 
predators of bedbugs. Bedbugs are not known to spread disease, but a minority 
of people are very sensitive to their bites</p> 
<h4>Other bugs</h4> 
<p>Bat bugs, poultry bugs and swallow bugs may be introduced into buildings as 
a result of the roosting or nesting activity of their hosts. These bugs 
occasionally bite humans.</p>

</p> 
<h3>Butterflies and Moths</h3> 
<p>Butterflies do not damage buildings, but it must be borne in mind that some 
species which hibernate in buildings are protected under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act. The larvae of several species of moth may damage building 
contents. Wood in contact with infested material may be damaged by shallow 
boring or scoring</p> 
<h4>White shouldered house moth, <em>Endrosis sarcitrella</em></h4> 
<p>Scavenger feeding on grain or vegetable debris in dwellings, farm 
buildings, warehouses. Wingspan 12-22mm, wings grey with dark patches and white 
'shoulders'</p> 
<h4>Brown house moth, <em>Hofmannophila pseudospretella</em></h4> 
<p>Scavenger feeding on grain or other vegetable debris, but requiring damp 
conditions for development. May occur in large numbers in warehouses, but also 
in houses where it may damage clothes, furnishings and cork floor inlays. 
Bird's nests are a frequent route of entry of the moth larvae into buildings. 
Wingspan 15-22mm, bronze brown with dark brown or black flecks in the fore wings
</p> 
<p>When the ambient conditions become less humid, the larvae are not 
destroyed. Instead they enter a dormant phase, and can stay like this for weeks 
until suitable conditions arise again. This moth is one of the most destructive 
of the house moths. Able to eat a wide variety of animal and plant material, it 
wreaks havoc, particularly in museums. Furs, skins, insect collections, seeds, 
dried fruit, carpets, herbs, clothing, leather and bookbindings can all be 
destroyed in a remarkably short period of times. Museums are notoriously short 
of money for capital expenditure and repairs and may as a consequence be damp 
and unheated. Neglect, damp conditions and storage that is not moth-proof have 
often led to the loss of irreplaceable material</p> 
<h4>Common clothes moth, <em>Tineola bisselliella</em></h4> 
<p>Pest of wool in warehouses and dwellings. Wingspan 12-17mm, golden buff to 
yellowish grey. Very agile, but the female only flies when disturbed. Eggs 1mm 
diameter, white found attached to wool or fur. Larval faecal pellets, 1mm 
diameter and not attached to materials are sometimes mistaken for eggs. The 
larvae usually spin tubes of silk in which they live</p> 
<p>Infestations may be counteracted by washing, dry cleaning, ironing or 
airing woollen clothes before storing them in sealed units, and using 
proprietary anti-moth compounds. Clean clothes are much less likely to be 
attacked than worn clothes</p> 
<h4>Case-bearing clothes moth, <em>Tineapellionella</em></h4> 
<p>Pest of wool, hair, feather pillows and stored dried food or vegetable 
drugs. Dusky brown with three, (sometimes feint) spots on the forewing. 
Wingspan 12-17mm. The larvae makes a case of silk (and any available cloth 
fibre) which it drags with it as it moves around. The case is 6 to 9mm long and 
the larva dies if separated from the case</p> 
<h4>Tapestry moth, <em>Trichophaga tapetzella</em></h4> 
<p>Mottled black and white, wingspan less than 12mm, only rarely found in 
dwellings.</p> 
<p>back to top?<br>
</p> 
<h3>Fleas</h3> 
<p>Small wingless insects, yellow to almost black in colour, with a hard 
narrow body covered in backward pointing spines. About 1000 species are known 
all are in their adult stages are external parasites on mammals and birds, and 
feed on their blood. They are attracted by warmth, avoid light, and are 
intensely sensitive to vibrations. Most species have eyes, except those that 
parasitise nocturnal or subterranean species</p> 
<p>The eggs are white or cream coloured, and unlike those of most other 
external parasites, do not adhere to the host, but instead fall to the ground, 
where the larvae feed on debris and faecal matter. The larvae are whitish, very 
active, worm-like and up to 4mm in length. When fully developed, the larva 
spins a cocoon to which stick fine dust particles, thus concealing it. The 
length of time pupating varies, but hatching may be triggered by vibration, for 
example, that caused by a person walking across the floor of a deserted house
</p> 
<p>Flea infestations are not related to building defects, but the nature and 
contents of buildings and building finishes can affect the ease with which 
infestations can be eradicated. When rats and mice are eliminated from 
building, their fleas can often, out of hunger, attack Man. It is therefore 
prudent to follow rodent eradication procedures with insecticidal sprays such 
as pyrethrins</p> 
<p>Fleas are responsible for the transmission of a number of diseases, most 
notably plague and typhus</p> 
<h4>Human flea, <em>Pulex irritans</em></h4> 
<p>Occurs throughout the world. Main host is Man but domestic animals such as 
dogs and cats also attacked, and with some wild animals such as foxes, badgers 
and hedgehogs. It is also particularly well adapted for living on pigs, and can 
occur in great abundance in pig sties</p> 
<p>The human flea can transmit the plague bacterium, <em>Pasteurella pestis
</em>, between individual humans, but it is not responsible for the major 
outbreaks</p> 
<h4>Dog flea, <em>Ctenocephalides canis</em></h4> 
<p>Cosmopolitan, parasitises cats, rabbits and Man as well as dogs. The flea 
larva may act as the vector for the dog tapeworm</p> 
<h4>Cat flea, <em>Ctenocephalides felis</em></h4> 
<p>Affects mainly cats, but other animals, including Man affected. May cause 
serious skin inflammation in victims who become sensitised to its saliva. Acts 
as a vector of plague in Africa</p> 
<h4>Tropical or oriental flea, <em>Xenopsylla cheopsis</em></h4> 
<p>The most effective vector of plague, this flea is mainly tropical in 
distribution and is only rarely found in Britain.</p>

</p> 
<h3>Other invertebrate pests</h3> 
<p>Invertebrates other than the arthropoda cause little damage to buildings, 
although some may pose a health risk to occupants</p> 
<h4>Woodlice</h4> 
<p>Woodlice are crustaceans. They have little ability to prevent water loss 
from their bodies, so they must of necessity frequent damp places, where they 
feed on fungi and decaying vegetable matter. They do no harm to sound 
materials, but the dark faecal matter can cause spoiling</p> 
<h4>Slugs and snails</h4> 
<p>These are rarely found in buildings, except in areas of extreme and 
persistant damp. One species of snail, has been observed to gouge tracks on the 
surface of calcareous surfaces, such as lime plaster</p> 
<h4>Tapeworms, flukes and roundworms</h4> 
<p>These are agents of disease for both Man and his animals. They are often 
spread as a result of faecal contamination or contaminated water supply. The 
the risk of their spreading should be taken into account in the design of 
buildings and building services, particularly in areas where they are endemic.

</p> 
<h3>Birds and buildings</h3> 
<p>Birds, on account of their being able to gain access at all levels of a 
building, and on account of their propensity to carry around nesting material 
and other debris can indirectly cause both structural and environmental health 
problems in buildings. More infrequently, birds in their search for food, 
nesting materials or roosting or nesting sites, can also directly cause actual 
damage to the fabric of a building. Birds may also cause serious inconvenience 
to building occupants as a result of noise, aggressive behaviour and fouling</p>
<h3>Type of buildings</h3> 
<p>Building type more than anything determines the degree of nuisance posed by 
birds</p> 
<h3>Birds: Miscellaneous species</h3> 
<h4>Gulls</h4> 
<p>There are three main species of gull: <em>Larus argentatus</em>, the 
herring gull,<em>Larus fuscus</em>, the lesser black headed gull and <em>Rissa 
tridactyla</em>, the Kittiwake </p> 
<p>Since about 1940, gulls have increasingly taken to occupying buildings for 
both nesting and perching. Their numbers have been increasing throughout most 
of this century, although a recent decline has been reported. Nests on houses 
are usually on the roof, often between the chimney pots. Nests have also been 
reported on the flat roofs and even window sills of warehouses. Apart from the 
soiling of the building fabric by excrement, fouling and blockage of gutters, 
during the breeding season, the birds tend to attack anyone approaching the 
nesting sites thus rendering maintenance impossible. The birds also cause noise 
nuisance, particularly in the early morning</p> 
<h4>Sparrows</h4> 
<p><em>Passer domesticus</em>, the house sparrow, is widely distributed and 
lives in close association with human activities. Damage is caused by the 
transport of nesting materials which can block spouts, gutters and downpipes, 
pose a fire risk and cause fouling of tanks and cisterns</p> 
<h4>Tits</h4> 
<p>Tits have been reported to peck away putty on freshly glazed windows. They 
have also been reported to cause minor damage to interior finishes and building 
contents</p> 
<h4>Starlings</h4> 
<p>Starlings are middle sized, sociable, aggressive birds recognisable by 
their jerky walk and iridescent plumage. Although rarely seen far from human 
habitation, starlings were not noted in towns prior to 1900. Problems arise 
both from nesting and communal roosting. The nests are large, untidy masses of 
feathers and vegetable matter fitted into any suitable aperture such as 
hopperheads, gutters, downpipes and roof or wall spaces if a bird sized hole 
exists. Apart from the effect on drainage, the nests become particularly 
insanitary as the chicks hatch. The communal roosting habit of starlings also 
creates problems. Since the same roosts may be used for months at a time, large 
amounts of faeces may build up, and the noise, from late afternoon until well 
after nightfall, may be intolerable</p> 
<p>Control may be achieved by spasmodic scaring of the roosting birds, 
preventing access or even using repellent chemicals</p> 
<h4>Woodpeckers</h4> 
<p>There are two British species of woodpecker, the Greater Spotted and the 
Lesser Spotted. Both are protected under theWildlife and Countryside Act.</p> 
<p>Woodpeckers cause occasional damage to the exterior woodwork of buildings. 
The most common is drumming, which male birds indulge in to define territories 
and as part of the courtship ritual. Targets are chosen for their resonant 
characteristics rather than their insect content, and include shingles, 
cladding, eaves and even aerial masts and downpipes. The behaviour may be 
deterred by painting the surface with 10 per cent pentachlorophenol oil (this 
may cause staining), by suspending strips of aluminium foil over the surface, 
or by shielding with chicken wire or nylon netting</p> 
<p>Occasional damage to insect infested timbers has been reported. The wooden 
churches of Romania, sadly neglected during the Communist era, have recently 
suffered severe damage from woodpeckers in search of wood boring insects.</p> 
<p>back to top?<br>
</p> 
<h3>Pigeons</h3> 
<p>The feral pigeon Columba livia var. and its by-products are very familiar 
to those involved in building surveying and maintenance especially to those 
working in city centres</p> 
<p>Many pest control companies offer pigeon control services and many pigeon 
exclusion systems are marketed. However there is a general lack of 
understanding of the problem among management and building professionals. This 
means that the control techniques used are often inappropriate or misapplied 
with the result that they are ineffective. This is not an insignificant problem 
as tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds can be spent on pigeon related 
contracts without proper independent advice or specification and without proper 
competitive tendering. Such 'one off' measures applying a single technique with 
no reference to other factors are often doomed to failure. This is because 
pigeons are living organisms and are able to adapt over time and space to 
circumvent most measures</p> 
<p>As with other biologically based building problems their control requires 
the application of a continuing strategy of measures to control the combination 
of environmental factors which favour their activities. This requires some 
background knowledge and the careful assessment of each case</p> 
<h4>Natural history of the pigeon</h4> 
<p>The feral pigeon Columba livia var. is descended from the wild rock dove 
which inhabits both inland and sea cliffs around the mediterranean and along 
the west coast of Europe [1]. This species was domesticated by the ancient 
Egyptians and has spread all over the world in many different domestic strains. 
The feral pigeon stocks are derived from many different strains of escaped 
ornamental, racing and domestic stocks but tend to revert to a wild type of 
colouring and conformation</p> 
<p>These birds are well-adapted to survive in a modern city environment where 
the tall buildings provide habitats very similar to the cliff homes of their 
ancestors.</p> 
<h5>Behaviour</h5> 
<p>In all activities that do not involve reproduction, the pigeon is a social 
bird which will actively seek the company of others in order to rest, preen, 
and feed. They may therefore form flocks of anything from tens to hundreds of 
individuals, depending on the available food sources. These flocks develop a 
set pattern of activity, based around a defined set of feeding, resting and 
roosting sites. However, birds disturbed from one roosting area may choose 
another, and continue there just as if they had never been disturbed.</p> 
<h5>Food</h5> 
<p>The natural diet of pigeons is one of seeds and grains but they easily 
learn to exploit a large range of processed vegetable and animal products. In 
addition to which, they also require a source of a grit for their crops, and a 
source of water</p> 
<h5>Breeding</h5> 
<p>Given an adequate food supply the pigeon can breed throughout the year and 
a stable pair bond is formed. Preferred nesting sites are dark enclosed areas 
simulating a cave or a crevice [3]. Two eggs are usually produced, and hatch 
within 17 to 22 days. Incubation is shared. The young reach maturity in about 4 
weeks. When newly hatched, the young are very immature, being blind and without 
feathers. For the first few days, they are fed with 'pigeons' milk', a cheesy 
substance produced in the wall of the crop. Three broods may be produced by a 
pair each breeding season and individuals may live as long as thirty years</p> 
<h5>Survival in towns</h5> 
<p>The most important factor in pigeon survival is the active promotion of 
their population by man, for recreational and emotional reasons. This is most 
significant in the provision of food, and in giving protection from human 
predation. The uncontrolled increase in populations of feral pigeons resulting 
from this commensal relationship has produced considerable problems in many 
city and seaport environments. These can be reduced by appropriate management 
and public education programmes</p> 
<h4>Problems caused by pigeons</h4> 
<p>Pigeon activity in and around a building may directly damage the structure 
as pigeons are capable of lifting roof coverings to force an entry, especially 
if these are already slightly displaced. This activity can allow significant 
water penetration into the building and subsequent decay. More seriously, they 
block rainwater drainage systems with their faeces, feathers and other 
detritus. This can cause massive water penetration and severe decay problems. 
Nesting activity is particularly dangerous in this respect as pigeons 
frequently nest in hopperheads and parapet gutters causing complete blockage in 
a very short time. This disruption of drainage and the resultant water 
penetration is especially damaging in unoccupied buildings where problems are 
less likely to be detected before major damage has been done. The results of 
water penetration are also more serious as there may already be serious damp 
and decay problems in the buildings. Pigeon activity of this sort can thus 
negate the effect of conservation and remedial work. This represents a 
considerable waste of time and money, and may lead to the degradation and loss 
of valuable building features</p> 
<p>Pigeon detritus and especially pigeon faeces represents both an aesthetic 
and a public health problem. This is particularly so when pigeons obtain access 
to the interior of a building. Pigeon droppings quickly deface finishes both to 
the inside and outside of buildings and are difficult and expensive to remove
</p> 
<h5>Health and safety issues</h5> 
<p>If measures are not taken to minimise pigeon activity around a building, 
their presence will cause significant problems for building management and 
maintenance. These problems are both avoidable and expensive to deal with. They 
can also have an appreciable effect on the cost of renovation works and the 
time taken to complete a project</p> 
<p>Though they are actively fed and encouraged by many members of the public, 
pigeons represent a public nuisance as well as a health hazard. This may be 
because of disturbance caused by calling or nesting activity in the early 
hours, by spreading of fleas and other parasites into inhabited buildings and 
by pestering for food. However, the most resented nuisance is caused by faeces. 
This is a potential problem where arches or ledges projected over public areas. 
Further problems might be expected if the pigeons are allowed to occupy 
scaffolding to be erected around a building</p> 
<h5>Diseases spread by pigeons</h5> 
<p>The presence of feral pigeons and most especially their faeces represents a 
potential health hazard to employees and to the general public. This is 
particularly so when large accumulations of filth build up inside a building</p>
<p>They are commonly carriers of a number of serious human diseases including 
salmonellosis, psiticosis and pseudo-tuberculosis. Their faeces provide an 
ideal environment for the growth of the organisms causing such diseases as 
histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcis and listeriosis. Although the risk 
of infection from pigeons may be relatively low, the diseases are severe and 
may be life threatening</p> 
<h5>Pigeon faeces problems</h5> 
<p>Health and safety problems are also caused by the build up of faeces due to 
the slippery and unsafe footing it provides on walkways and ledges endearing 
proper maintenance. This may also be a particular problem during building works 
and renovation</p> 
<p>Pigeon faeces represent a health and safety hazard for employees who have 
to remove them or work in their vicinity. They are thus a special problem in 
the renovation of buildings where large accumulations have been allowed to 
build up. Dealing with such accumulations can be expensive and time consuming 
because of the protective equipment and procedures that may be required</p> 
<h4>Pigeon control: reducing bird populations</h4> 
<p>Many techniques have been used for controlling pigeons around buildings all 
of which have advantages and disadvantages [4]. Some of the more common 
techniques currently employed are listed below when considering control options 
it is useful to distinguish those that reduce pigeon numbers in an area or 
merely modify their behaviour</p> 
<h5>Food reduction</h5> 
<p>This is the most successful long-term measure for controlling absolute 
numbers of pigeons in an area. During the Second World War reduction of food 
availability dramatically reduced the numbers of pigeons despite the increase 
in suitable nesting and roosting sites</p> 
<h5>Poisons and narcotic baits</h5> 
<p>Poisons can provide an effective control especially those producing a 
period of deranged behaviour. This alarms other birds in the flock and they 
will avoid the location in the future. Narcotic baits are available which 
stupify the birds which may then be collected and disposed of by licensed bird 
handlers. Poisoning of birds is illegal in the UK</p> 
<h5>Trapping</h5> 
<p>Pigeons may be caught in live traps after a short period of baiting. A 
large proportion of a flock feeding in a given area can be removed by this 
technique. Traps require a private area for operation and regular attention by 
an experienced operator. The problem of this technique and others that involve 
the removal of birds from an area without reducing the suitability of the 
environment is that other birds will soon move in from adjacent areas.</p> 
<h5>Birth control and removal of nest sites</h5> 
<p>Baits impregnated with birth control agents can be used but have limited 
uses as decreases in reproduction are made up by increased recruitment of birds 
from other areas. Removal of nest sites reduces reproduction but more 
importantly obliges breeding birds to leave the area. Nesting activity is a 
major source of the detritus blocking drainage around the building.</p> 
<h5>Shooting</h5> 
<p>Shooting using an air gun or .22 garden gun may not significantly affect 
pigeon population. However, it is an effective method of scaring the birds away 
from a location. If carried out regularly at the time birds are settling for 
the night it will prevent a roost being established at that location.</p> 
<h5>Predators</h5> 
<p>Food supplies rather than predators are the main determinants of pigeon 
numbers. However, falcons and other raptors are used successfully to clear 
birds from feeding sites such as airfields. In buildings the problem often 
arises from roosting rather than feeding behaviour. When threatened by a 
raptor, pigeons tend to cower into their roosts rather than fly away. Therefore 
the use of trained airborne predators would not be useful in these 
circumstances, but around airfields, the aim of control methods is to reduce 
the risk of aircraft bird strikes, rather than to prevent roosting. 
Domesticated carnivores such as mink, ferrets or cats will kill individual 
birds. More significantly they will disturb the birds in those areas where they 
hunt, preventing roosting, resting and nesting.</p> 
<h5>Reducing pigeon occupancy</h5> 
<p>In general, methods of reducing pigeon populations available to the owner 
of an individual building in an urban area are unlikely to be effective, and 
even less likely to be acceptable</p> 
<h5>Bird scarers</h5> 
<p>Bird scarers may be visual, audio, mechanical or a combination [2]. They 
work by producing a stimulus that is perceived as frightening or noxious by the 
pigeons. Unfortunately they have proved generally ineffective for this species 
due to its great adaptability and learning powers. Unless reinforced by actual 
pigeon deaths, they soon learn to ignore alarming sights and sounds. 
Appropriate reinforcement may involve killing pigeons and displaying their 
carcasses</p> 
<p>The use of recorded alarm calls is also ineffective in this species, 
primarily because no true alarm call has been identified but also because when 
alarmed the rock pigeon tends to sit tight on its perch. The use of noxious 
stimuli such as loud sirens or explosions often becomes ineffective for similar 
reasons. These techniques are also unacceptable around occupied buildings due 
to the disturbance and nuisance they cause to people</p> 
<h5>Bird nets</h5> 
<p>Fine, standard large mesh plastic nets are used to exclude pigeons from 
areas of a building. They may be used in large sections to wall off whole areas 
or in small strips to prevent pigeon access to individual features. Fixing 
should be by stainless steel pins and wires. Colour is generally black to 
reduce decay of the plastic by ultra violet sunlight</p> 
<p>Netting is a very effective and economical way of preventing pigeon damage 
on a building, but may have the following problems netting may give a hazy 
appearance to buildings with finely detailed decoration and it may be obtrusive 
on light or brightly coloured buildings. The use of netting in small sections 
requires relatively high numbers of fixing points and it has a life of five to 
ten years</p> 
<p>The heaviest gauge netting possible should be used and special attention 
paid to reinforcing it at edges or attachment points. If this is not done it 
will soon tear loose. In large areas and in exposed locations the net should be 
reinforced with stainless steel wire</p> 
<h5>Sprung wires</h5> 
<p>Stainless steel wire may be mounted on thin stainless steel brackets via 
short springs of the same material. These are placed a few inches above ledges 
at an appropriate height to interfere with landing and take-off by the pigeons. 
This is especially useful on narrow ledges and very cost effective where long 
straight runs of a few metres can be laid. Such wiring is unobtrusive, is 
easily removed and replaced for maintenance work, and has a life of at least 
ten years</p> 
<h5>Spikes</h5> 
<p>Several different systems of stainless steel or plastic spikes are 
available for fitting to buildings to discourage pigeons from landing. Although 
some of these are quite effective they suffer from a number of problems sharp 
steel spikes are very dangerous to maintenance personnel, litter may become 
caught on the spikes, build-up of faeces makes them ineffective, their 
appearance may be unattractive, they are relatively expensive and they may 
require more fixing points than nets or wires</p> 
<h5>Repellent gels</h5> 
<p>A number of adhesive gels are available which are intended to be spread on 
surfaces so as to make it unpleasant for the birds to perch. These can be 
effective when fresh. However they are expensive and loose their effect after a 
year or so. This means they require regular replacement and are uneconomical in 
most cases. The gels can also cause damage or fouling problems themselves and 
can be very difficult to clean off a building once applied. They may be 
unaesthetic and hazardous for those working on the treated surfaces</p> 
<h4>Investigation of pigeon problems</h4> 
<p>The control of pigeons and pigeon related problems requires the coordinated 
application of a combination of measures and attention to detail. Application 
of single techniques is at best inefficient and is often ineffective. What is 
required therefore is a careful assessment of the pigeon problem, the 
ecological factors favouring the pigeons and those factors that could be most 
cost effectively controlled. This necessitates a site investigation and some 
analysis</p> 
<h5>Site investigation</h5> 
<p>A specialist investigation should be carried out to determine the activity 
of the feral pigeons at the building. This investigation should define the 
extent of the problem. Often the most significant problems are not immediately 
obvious and those which may be causing most management disquiet may in reality 
be trivial. The short and long term consequence of the problem should be 
assessed and costed so that their relative importance is appreciated The next 
stage is to carry out a detailed study of the ecology of the pigeon population 
in the area. This should include mapping of pigeon numbers and activity around 
the building through a 24 hour period, assessing critical factors such as 
feeding sites, roosting sites, nesting sites and loafing areas The factors 
limiting pigeon population in the area should be assessed. The most important 
of these factors is usually the availability of food sources. The proportion of 
sick and out of condition birds in the population and the general condition of 
the birds should be determined. The effect of current and previous pigeon 
control measures should be noted. It is important to identify which of the 
pigeons activities are causing the identified problems, for example, nesting 
activity causing blocked drains, or roosting causing faecal contamination</p> 
<h5>Analysis of data</h5> 
<p>The results of the investigation of pigeon ecology around the problems 
building should be analysed in detail. Using the data it is possible to 
determine which pigeon activities and environmental factors are significant in 
causing the problems identified. Simple statistical techniques and graphic 
representation of the can be especially useful for this purpose. They are also 
very useful in demonstrating the problems to the property owner or manager. The 
next step is to identify the factors limiting the pigeon population, and those 
limiting the troublesome activities. For example the availability of safe nest 
sites may be the critical factor attracting activity around a particular 
building. Alternatively the availability of sheltered roosting sites may be 
crucial It is essential to identify factors which can be controlled in a 
cost-effective manner. Required works and/or management measures can then be 
identified</p> 
<h5>Remedial programme</h5> 
<p>A comprehensive remedial programme should be developed using the results of 
the investigation and analysis. This must take into account the management and 
use of the building as well as aesthetic and financial constraints Only rarely 
will it be possible to eliminate a pigeon population or to totally exclude 
pigeons from a building. In most cases a percentage reduction in pigeon numbers 
or the control of a particularly damaging activity is all that is required. 
Appreciation of this fact, and the presentation of achievable targets to the 
building owner or manager will prevent disappointment The early definition of 
acceptable limits to pigeon activity will also prevent the over-use of 
particular techniques where the law of diminishing returns can result in wasted 
resources and defaced buildings</p> 
<h5>Specialised control and exclusion techniques</h5> 
<p>A combination of specialist techniques should be chosen taking into account 
their costs and limitations Care and attention to detail in specification and 
application are essential, or even the most suitable techniques or product will 
be inefficient or ineffective. For example, the positioning of wires can be 
critical and a single faulty attachment point in a net system can make it 
useless The side effects of each protection technique on other aspects of the 
performance of the building must be carefully dealt with. For example, nets or 
spikes may trap rubbish, fixing points may allow water ingress or accelerated 
erosion of surfaces, and most products will restrict access by maintenance 
personnel</p> 
<p>Blocking up of internal cavities, for example roof spaces, without due 
regard to the provision of suitable ventilation, may result in condensation and 
damp related decay problems</p> 
<h5>Damage control measures</h5> 
<p>It is often cost effective to take steps to limit the damaging effects of 
pigeon activity and this can often be easier than controlling the pigeons 
themselves. To this end hopperheads and secret gutters draining the roof 
surfaces should be cleared of all pigeon detritus. They should then be 
protected from future blockage with 'sausages' of crushed chicken wire or 
secured with mesh grills. In either case provision should be made for clearing 
any debris that accumulates. The provision of adequate access facilities and 
safety points for clearing pigeon affected areas is also important</p> 
<h5>Routine inspection and cleaning</h5> 
<p>The building should be routinely inspected for pigeons, fresh faeces, 
nesting materials and pigeon related problems such as blocked roof drainage 
systems. The building should also be checked for building defects that could 
allow pigeon access to the interior of the roof spaces. Any detritus should be 
cleaned off the structure and any defects should be repaired as necessary. Such 
a programme would require a minimum of monthly inspection. Again provision of 
adequate access and equipment is very important.</p> 
<h4>Food reduction</h4> 
<p>A continuous and vigorous policy of food restriction should be applied 
around the building. This should involve the elimination of refuse and litter 
by regular cleaning, the use of pigeon-proof refuse containers, and public 
education to discourage voluntary feeding. This is the most important measure 
in any pest control strategy.</p> 
<h4>Management measures</h4> 
<p>Responsibility for aspects of the control of the pigeon problem must be 
specifically included in the programmes for the management of the cleaning and 
maintenance of the building. This will require appropriate budget provisions to 
be made.</p> 
<p>Overall responsibility for pigeon management should be given to an 
individual manager and relevant accounts kept so that the cost of pigeon damage 
and its prevention can be assessed. In addition the overall pigeon problem in 
the area should be assessed annually as part of the building management 
programme in order to assess the efficiency of the programme.</p> 
<p>Usually such a programme would be the responsibility of those managers 
responsible for cleaning, but there may be advantages in making pigeon control 
a Health and Safety responsibility in order to increase its priority.</p> 
<h4>Overview</h4> 
<p>The control of feral pigeons is a management problem which requires the 
continuous application of a number of measures over a period of time. Control 
is therefore unlikely to be achieved by the application of a single product or 
technique. The most important measures to be taken are often general 
maintenance and management works. This is especially true as total elimination 
of the pigeons and their associated problems is unlikely to be cost effective 
or even achievable.</p> 
<p>Efficient pigeon control requires that the extent and nature of the problem 
should be defined before any action is contemplated. Goals should then be set 
that are acceptable and achievable within the resources available. It is then 
important to monitor the effect of any measures taken and to take further 
actions as necessary.</p> 
<p>As in all building remedial work the key factors are independent 
investigation and advice, careful specification, competitive tendering, a 
holistic approach, and continued monitoring [5]</p>

</p> 
<h3>Mammalian pests</h3> 
<p>Effective pest control programs emphasize preventative measures. The first 
and best defence against mammalian pests is to exclude them from the building. 
Until exclusion methods are in place or if exclusion proves impossible, 
continuous trapping may be necessary. After trapping has been effectively 
carried out, exclusion techniques should be maintained to prevent more pests 
from entering the building.</p> 
<p>Resort to chemical control methods only when trapping methods have failed. 
Contact poisons, poison baiting, and fumigation result in animals dying in 
inaccessible locations where their corpses will putrefy and attract insect 
pests. Poisons will not prevent recurrence of the pest problem unless exclusion 
methods are thoroughly carried out.</p> 
<p>Because many recommended pesticides are, to varying degrees, toxic to man 
and to wild and domestic animals, caution must be exercised in their use, and 
the manufacturers' directions must be closely followed. The use of many pest 
control chemicals is restricted, and the service of a professional pest control 
firm is required for their application.</p> 
<p>This section covers the most common mammalian pests encountered in 
buildings. The guidelines for dealing with these pests may be applicable to 
other species. Before dealing with an unfamiliar animal, check local and 
national regulations on its status. Many fur-bearing mammals are protected, but 
this does not necessarily exclude the possibility of trapping or destruction if 
they are a persistent threat to a property. Live trapping may be considered. 
The animals may be subsequently released at some distance from the building. 
However, such subsequentrelease is not permitted for introduced species such as 
the grey squirrel.</p> 
<h4>Exclusion of mammalian pests</h4> 
<p>Most authorities stress that prevention by exclusion is the most effective 
long-term solution to a mammalian pest problem. The following precautions will 
discourage entry of rodents and other small animals into a building.</p> 
<h4>Eliminate food sources</h4> 
<p>Keep food out of the building or, at least, in sealed metal containers. 
Keep garbage in an enclosed area away from the building. Practice good 
housekeeping methods in kitchens, cafeterias and lunch rooms. Clean spills 
immediately and thoroughly.</p> 
<h4>Eliminate sources of drinking water</h4> 
<p>Eliminate sources of drinking water by repairing leaky pipes and taps, and 
by covering open drains with heavy screens using 6mm galvanized wire mesh (16 
to 19 gauge). Prevent the formation of condensation on cold pipes by installing 
pipe insulation.</p> 
<h4>Block off entry points</h4> 
<p>Ensure that doors and windows are tight-fitting and latched. Secure all 
vents and louvres, and cover openings with 6mm galvanized wire mesh. Ensure 
that attic vents are screened. Use sheet metal or concrete to block off all 
small openings to the outside, particularly in the foundation and ground floor 
of a building. Exclusion methods must not interfere with normal ventilation of 
buildings. Inadequately ventilated buildings can accumulate moisture, leading 
to fungal problems</p> 
<h4>Avoid clutter</h4> 
<p>Keep storage areas uncluttered and orderly, and inspect them frequently. 
Shelving and cabinets should be mounted a minimum of 10 cm off the floor to 
allow for thorough cleaning and inspection and to discourage pests from 
residing there</p> 
<p>Prevent entry by climbing</p> 
<p>Cut back any overhanging branches to beyond 3 metres from the building, and 
remove any climbing plants which animals could use to gain access at upper 
levels</p> 
<p>Deter animals from living close to a building</p> 
<p>Dig up, disturb or remove nesting sites, burrows and hiding places. 
Eliminate from around buildings all undergrowth and debris, which can provide 
protective cover</p> 
<p>Refuse management</p> 
<p>Keep all refuse, especially food matter and material suitable for nesting, 
in secure, rodent-proof containers. If practicable, avoid leaving plastic 
refuse bags out overnight</p>

<h3>Species of mammalian pest</h3> 
<p>Correct identification of the pest causing the problem in a building is 
essential for choosing an effective solution. Use field guides to aid this 
identification. Apart from rodents, the following animals may be encountered</p>
<h4>Feral cats</h4> 
<p>Feral cats live on discarded food, rats, mice and birds. Being extremely 
timid, they may occur in quite large numbers without often being seen. They 
generally cause little damage, but they may introduce cat fleas into buildings, 
especially in their sleeping places</p> 
<h4>Squirrels</h4> 
<p>Squirrels are generally only a minor irritation, but they have been known 
to chew cables and electrical wiring. They can create much noise and 
disturbance, can introduce parasites and may bite fiercely if cornered. They 
may be deterred from climbing trees or walls by placing a 2 feet wide metal 
band around the tree or on the wall, about 3 to 4 feet above ground. They may 
be repelled from entering roof and other spaces by spreading napthalene: 
physical exclusion is preferable wherever possible. Note that grey squirrels 
are an introduced species, and consequently, if they are caught alive in a 
trap, they must not be released at some other location</p> 
<h4>Rodents, Rodentia</h4> 
<p>Rats and mice are potentially damaging in both urban and rural settings. 
These animals may also carry diseases that can infect man through bites or by 
contact with hair, excreta, or parasites, such as fleas, lice, and mites</p> 
<h4>Natural history of rodents</h4> 
<p>Two types of rat are found in Britain, the black rat, Rattus rattus, and 
the brown or Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus. The brown rat is larger, more 
heavily built and agressive than the black rat and has consequently ousted the 
black rat from most habitats. However, the superior climbing abilities of the 
black rat allow a degree of co-existence. In Britain, the black rat is mainly 
confined to sea ports</p> 
<p>Both species are omnivorous, but the black rat prefers vegetable food. 
Except in rapidly expanding populations (where white and black individuals are 
common), the brown rat is almost universally brown, with a paler underside. The 
black rat varies in colour from tawny yellow to black</p> 
<p>Mice are found in perhaps the majority of homes around the world, in 
addition to food stores, agricultural land etc. Mice often enter buildings in 
autumn to overwinter, and constitute a common rodent problem</p>

pass through 10mm (3/8&quot;) hole enter buildings in fall for shelter during 
winter inhabit enclosed spaces such as wall cavities burrow 20 cm deep 
excellent climbers, good swimmers, and can jump 30 cm</p> 
<h4>Field mice (several species) <em></em></h4> 
<p>Field mice are protected wild animals. They may occasionally enter 
buildings in the autumn or winter. The mice, if identified, should not be 
poisoned, but should either be ignored, or caught alive in special traps, and 
subsequently released in the countryside</p> 
<p><strong>Rodent control</strong></p> 
<p>Rodent infestations create considerable hazards for buildings, their 
contents and their occupants. Prevention of infestations should be approached 
from three angles discouragement of entry into buildings, prevention of access 
to food and water, and destruction of animals which do gain entry. Destruction 
of external animals is of limited usefulness, except where the external 
population is high and its food supply is limited, resulting in unusually 
determined attempts to enter buildings. However, removal of shelter close to 
buildings can help reduce the external population, and discourage attempts to 
gain entry</p> 
<p><strong>Identifying a rodent problem</strong></p> 
<p>The following signs, often evident before rodents are even seen, indicate 
that rodents are present</p> 
<p><strong>Tooth marks and gnawing</strong></p> 
<p>Tooth marks from gnawing wood chips near baseboards or cabinets or 
irregular losses, tears, or soiling of fabrics. Rodents engage in gnawing to 
wear down their constantly growing incisor teeth, to gain access to food, and 
to make nests. Most soft materials, including aluminium, asphalt, and lime 
mortar, are susceptable to rodent knawing</p> 
<p><strong>Faecal droppings</strong></p> 
<p>Droppings are produced in large numbers and will dry in one or two days. 
Rat droppings often contain hair. Because of the possibility of disease, do not 
handle rodent droppings directly wear gloves or use a dustpan</p> 
<p><strong>Urine droplets</strong></p> 
<p>Urine deposited as small dribbles or as a line of droplets. Dried rat urine 
stains may not be visible to the naked eye, but will fluoresce blue-white under 
ultraviolet illumination. Avoid contact with urine. Use germicidal janitorial 
detergent to clean rodent urine off surfaces</p> 
<p><strong>Grease marks and dirt</strong></p> 
<p>Greasy smudges on wals, beams and pipes deposited from dirty and oily 
rodent fur. These marks are only visible in high traffic areas, or around holes 
etc, where the animals have had to squeeze against a surface to pass</p> 
<p><strong>Nests of shredded material</strong></p> 
<p>Nests made from shredded material, such as paper or textiles. Nests will 
usually be found in dark, dry, sheltered, and undisturbed areas, and are 
usually well concealed</p> 
<p><strong>Paw prints</strong></p> 
<p>Tracks of paw prints on dusty surfaces. Apply a non-toxic tracking powder, 
such as talc (not flour), along walls or suspected runs, and observe for 
several days to confirm the presence of rodents. Inspect the tracking powder 
with a raking light to enhance the visibility of the tracks. The front paws of 
rodents leave tracks showing four toes, the rear paw tracks are elongated and 
have five toes, and the tails leave short lines as marks</p> 
<p><strong>Burrows or holes</strong></p> 
<p>Burrows in the earth around buildings, or holes in the building foundations 
of 100mm in diameter that were made or enlarged by rodents. Rat nesting and 
access burrows are usually less than 1.2m deep. Fill in burrow entrances and 
check for excavation on the following day to determine if they are in use</p> 
<p><strong>Sounds of gnawing, squeaking, or scampering</strong></p> 
<p>Sounds of gnawing, squeaking, or scampering in walls. Sounds will be heard 
mainly at night unless the rodent colony is overpopulated</p> 
<p><strong>Odour</strong></p> 
<p>Rats have little odour unless the population is large or well established. 
Mice can often be detected by their musky odour</p> 
<p><strong>Live or dead rodents observed</strong></p> 
<p>Live or dead rodents seen in the building. Do not handle live or dead 
rodents with bare hands see precautions described below</p> 
<p><strong>Capabilities of rats</strong></p> 
<p>Rats are able to gain entrance through any opening larger than 13mm square 
Climb both horizontal and vertical wires and cables Climb the inside of 
vertical pipes which are 40-100mm in diameter Climb the outside of vertical 
pipes and conduits up to 75mm in diameter Climb the outside of vertical pipes 
of any size if the pipe is within 75mm of a wall or other continuous support 
for the rodent Crawl horizontally on any type of pipe or conduit Jump 
vertically as much as 1 m from a flat surface Jump horizontally 1.2 m on a flat 
surface Jump horizontally at least 2.4 m from an elevation of 4.5 m Drop 15 m 
without being killed or seriously injured Burrow vertically in earth to a depth 
of 1.25 m Climb brick or other rough exterior walls which offer footholds to 
gain access to upper storeys of structures Climb vines, shrubs and trees, or 
travel along telephone or power lines to gain access to upper storeys of 
buildings Reach as much as 330mm along smooth, vertical walls Swim as far as 
0.8 km in open water dive through water plumbing traps and travel in sewer 
lines even against substantial water currents Gnaw through a wide variety of 
materials, including lead sheeting, lime mortar, aerated concrete blocks and 
aluminium sheeting</p> 
<p><strong>Capabilities of mice</strong></p> 
<p>Mice are able to jump to heights of 800mm Jump gaps of 1.5m Gain entry 
through 8mm holes Burrow up to 1m underground Travel up to 0.5 km from their 
nest Climb up pipes and wires Swim Survive on as little as 1ml of water per day 
while eating dry food</p> 
<p><strong>Additional exclusion methods</strong></p> 
<p>Total exclusion of rodents may not be cost-effective, but deterrence of 
entry most certainly is. Apart from the general exclusion methods detailed 
above, the following techniques may also be necessary</p> 
<p><strong>Metal cladding</strong></p> 
<p>If rodents are gnawing at wooden doors or window frames, apply sheet metal 
cladding as a deterrent</p> 
<p><strong>Prevention of climbing</strong></p> 
<p>Place large sheet metal cones (300mm long and 450mm in diameter) on 
exterior pipes and poles at a height of 2.5 metres to prevent the animals 
jumping past the cones and climbing up to points of access. Fasten 400mm 
squares of sheet metal over small pipes and wires that run up walls. Caulk gaps 
between sheet metal guards and wires to prevent mice crawling through</p> 
<h4>Poisoning and trapping</h4> 
<p>Poisoning and trapping are most effective when combined with suitable 
exclusion measures. In general, trapping is more effective for mice, while 
poisoning works better with rats. Trapping has the advantage that it prevents 
the rodent from dying in an inaccessible location where it will produce a foul 
smell and attract insect pests. Live trapping is possible the animals may 
subsequently be released at some distance from the building, or killed by 
fumigation</p> 
<h4>Rat baits and poisons</h4> 
<p>Rats are inquisitive they are also creatures of habit. Traps and baits 
should be laid on well used runs. New traps, or unaccustomed food sources will 
be treated at first with caution. If regular inspection of traps or baits is 
possible, unpoisoned bait or unsprung traps should be first laid. Once the rats 
have become used to them, add poison to the bait, or set the trap springs. In 
the case of poison, it is essential to lay enough so that every rat that eats 
it receives a fatal dose, as any surviving animals will be warned off such 
baits. Extreme care must be taken to ensure that the carcases of poisoned rats 
are either removed and buried or burned, or else that they are completely 
inaccessible where they die, otherwise dogs, cats, pigs and wildlife may also 
be poisoned</p> 
<p>Suitable baits for rats include bacon, raw or cooked meat, fish, peanut 
butter, fresh bread and oatmeal</p> 
<h4>Mouse baits and poisons</h4> 
<p>Mice are much less sociable animals than rats, and their feeding habits are 
very different. A rat, on finding food to its taste, will gorge itself until 
either it can eat no more, or the food is exhausted. Mice, however, nibble, 
rarely taking more than a few mouthfuls at a time from each source of food. 
Mice are also highly territorial, and the males constantly patrol their 
territories. Consequently, mice are much easier to trap than rats, even with 
unbaited traps, but they are much more difficult to poison. Bait shyness 
develops rapidly, and even with Warfarin-type baits, it is difficult to 
persuade the animals to eat enough over a period to be lethal</p> 
<p>Suitable baits for mice include fruit, cake, peanut butter, seeds, sugar 
candy, gum drops and oatmeal</p> 
<h4>Traps</h4> 
<p>The snap trap, also called the guillotine, spring or break-back trap) is 
cheap, effective and widely available. Since it usually kills instantly, it is 
perhaps the most humane of all rodent control methods. Considerable suffering, 
however, can be caused if the animal is not killed but caught eg by one of its 
limbs</p> 
<p>Traps must be placed out of the reach of the public, especially children. 
Traps should be placed near holes or runways, or at sites of previous damage. 
Ideally, traps should be secured in place to prevent them from being dragged 
away by a trapped animal. Keep a record of places where traps are laid in order 
to prevent their being accidentally tripped.</p> 
<p>Traps should be checked daily. Take care when setting traps - traps, 
particularly those for rats, can break a finger if accidentally tripped</p> 
<h4>Anticoagulant poisons</h4> 
<p>Anticoagulant poisons, the best known of which is warfarin, cause the 
animal to die of anaemia after prolonged internal bleeding. Repeated dosage 
over five days is needed. The animals are said to feel no discomfort and hence 
are not usually warned off the baits. Warfarin resistant strains of rats have 
been reported, so higher dose baits may sometimes be needed. However, it has 
been suggested that so-called 'super-rats' are not so much resistant as wise to 
warfarin baits</p> 
<p>Wild and domestic animals are unlikely to be harmed as a result of eating a 
single rat poisoned by Warfarin. However, where a large population of rats is 
gradually killed off, repeated scavenging of the carcases may result in an 
animal receiving the lethal repeat dose</p> 
<p>Acute poisons</p> 
<p>The most frequently used acute poison is fluoroacetamide, sold under the 
trade names 'Fluorakil' and 'Compound 1081', usually as cereal bait. It is 
extremely poisonous with a LD50 dose of 15 mg/kg for rats, considerably less 
for dogs. The chemical is a colourless, crystalline solid, very soluble in 
water, and odourless and tasteless. No antidote exists, and it is readily 
absorbed through cuts and abrasions, so great emphasis must be placed on safe 
handling and storage. Under the Poisons Rules 1970, its use in Britain is 
restricted to sewers, drains, docks and some other areas where human access is 
controlled</p> 
<p>Other acute poisons include strychnine, phosphorus paste, zinc phosphate 
and sodium fluoroacetate</p> 
<p>It is essential when laying baits with this type of poison that sufficient 
is eaten by the animal to kill it outright, otherwise bait shyness develops. As 
a consequence of the large dose which may be ingested, a relatively small 
amount of poisoned rodent eaten by a much larger scavenger (eg a dog), can 
prove fatal</p> 
<p>Carcases of animals killed by these poisons must be incinerated or securely 
buried</p> 
<h4>Antidotes to poisons</h4> 
<p>No antidote exists for acute poisons, eg fluoroacetamide. Vitamin K acts as 
an antidote to anticoagulant poisons. In the event of accidental ingestion of 
the poison, Vitamin K should be administered under medical or vetinerary 
supervision</p> 
<h4>Fumigation</h4> 
<p>Fumigation should only be resorted to when all other methods have failed. 
The bodies of the animals remain in inaccesible locations, where their decay is 
likely to cause health problems. Fumigants may also damage building contents</p>
<p>Animals trapped in their burrows, or inhabiting air-tight buildings may be 
killed with fumigants such as methyl bromide, chloropicrin or calcium cyanide. 
These may only be used by registered pest control officers</p> 
<p>Carbon dioxide fumigation, in a sealed container, may be used to dispose of 
animals caught alive in traps, which are not intended to be released. It is 
regarded as the most humane method of killing such animals</p> 
<h4>Diseases spread by rodents</h4> 
<p>Rats can spread disease both directly and indirectly. Food poisoning 
organisms such as Salmonella may be spread via rat faeices and urine. Weil's 
disease, a severe and often fatal form of jaundice, is spread, particularly in 
water, by rat (and less often mouse) urine. Mouse faeces may spread tapeworms

<h3> Plant growth and buildings </h3> 
<p>There is a tendency in the building industry to regard plants, and 
particularly trees, with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Building users, 
on the other hand, tend to welcome plants in a building's environs. While 
plants can damage buildings, or more often, exacerbate the effects of building 
defects or poor maintenance, they can also protect. They are also the most cost 
effective decoration available</p> 
<p>Plants growing in the environs of a building benefit not just the users of 
the building, but the whole community, and also wildlife. This can have legal 
and planning implications. Careful management of plant growth not only enhances 
the aesthetic benfits of the plants, but also reduces or removes most of the 
associated problems</p> 
<p>Plants, building users and building owners</p> 
<p>Plants can improve the appearance of a building, and the local 
microclimate, but plant growth has structural and legal implications for 
building owners and landowners</p> 
<p>Structural considerations</p> 
<p>Buildings can provide plants with support, or a place to grow undisturbed. 
Damp masonry and accumulations of debris can provide a substrate in which roots 
may grow. Plant growth, whether deliberate or accidental, can in some 
circumstances protect buildings, and in other circumstances damage them</p> 
<p>The presence of plants can reduce the rate of drying, block ventilation 
holes, further the accumulation of debris, lead to the raising of external 
ground levels, and provide protection and cover for animal pests of all types. 
The most common problems are caused not but the plants themselves, but by dead 
leaves and other matter building up in rain and other drainage channels. 
Ultimately, however, such problems are due to building defects, poor 
maintenance, or poor management of plant growth</p> 
<p>Plant cover can reduce erosion by wind and rain, reduce the force with 
which draughts and rain can penetrate a building, and reduce the rate of 
cooling of a building at night</p> 
<p>Plants may cause direct damage roots and shoots can exert very great forces 
when penetrating masonry and other surfaces. Plants, especially trees, growing 
in the vicinity of buildings may also have adverse effects disturbance of 
ground water by trees, fire risk, lightning hazards and physical damage, 
especially in relation to storm damage</p> 
<h4>Plant growth over boundaries</h4> 
<p>Landowners are obliged to cut back plant growth where it interferes with 
the safe passage of vehicles or pedestrians</p> 
<p>When plants are growing over neighbouring properties, the owners of the 
neighbouring properties are entitled to cut back the plants at the boundary 
line, regardless of whether (in the case of trees) this is compatible with good 
arboricultural practice</p> 
<p>Landowners are responsible for any damage caused by plants growing within 
their property, eg trees falling onto neighbouring highways or properties</p> 
<h4>Poisonous plants</h4> 
<p>Where the public has right of access, or a poisonous plant grows over the 
boundary, landowners are responsible for its effects. For example, if a 
neighbour's animals are poisoned by eating yew growing on or over the boundary, 
the the landowner is responsible for the consequences. However, the landowner 
is not liable if the animals are poisoned as a result of straying or stretching 
into the land - unless the landowner has a responsibility to maintain the 
fences, and the poisoning was the result of the landowner's failure to do so. 
Local authorites have been held responsible for deaths by poisoning as a result 
of children eating the berries of poisonous plants growing in parks and botanic 
gardens. Presumably, this responsibility applies to plants growing on any land 
to which the public has access, or a right of way exists Glasgow Corporation v 
Taylor, 1922</p> 
<h4>Plants and planning and other restrictions</h4> 
<p>Tree Preservation Orders are discussed below </p> 
<p>The planting or the retention of plants, trees or gardens can be a 
condition of planning permission, or can form part of the conditions governing 
a conservation area. Under the National Heritage Act 1983, English Heritage may 
include parks and gardens on the 'Register of Historic Parks and Gardens'. The 
register has no statutory effect, but local authorities are said to give 'a 
fair degree' of weight to it</p> 
<p>Sites of Special Scientific Interest may be declared around existing or 
proposed buildings. Under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, this is the 
responsibility of English Nature (formerly the Nature Conservancy Council), if 
it considers that the land is of special interest because of its flora, fauna, 
geological or physiographical features. After recommendations are made to the 
local planning authority and the Secretary of State, the site is given special 
protection against any activity that could harm or destroy the item of 
interest. Under the Act, 93 types of plant are currently protected, with 
special protection for birds, wetlands and forestry</p> 
<p>back to top?<br>
</p> 
<h3>Climbing plants</h3> 
<p>Most types of climbing plants can use a building for support often this has 
a decorative effect so that the plant growth may have been welcomed or even 
initiated by the building owner. The appearance of a many a grim structure has 
been improved by the growth of flowering plants or creepers, but if plant 
growth is permitted at all, it must be very carefully managed, and its effects 
carefully monitored</p> 
<h4>Climbing plants and moisture</h4> 
<p>Opinions differ over the effect of climbing plants on the moisture balance 
of buildings. Some feel that the overall effect is negligible, while others 
feel that climbing plants should be avoided at all costs. Neither school of 
thought appears to be supported by actual measurements.</p> 
<p>Plant growth may cover up ventilation channels, especially air bricks and 
vents for under-floor spaces and roof voids, especially at the eaves. If 
vegetation is to be permitted, these ventilation channels must be regularly 
checked and cleaned</p> 
<p>Deciduous, and to a lesser extent evergreen creepers can deposit large 
quantities of dead leaves, petals or even fruiting bodies into rain and other 
drainage channels, leading to their blockage and subsequent water ingress into 
the building. Regular inspections are therefore a necessity when creeper growth 
is permitted. When specifying for new building or building refurbishment, it is 
advisable: i) to make arrangements to assist access for inspections and ii) to 
specify larger rainwater drainage gutters, downpipes etc than would otherwise 
be strictly necessary</p> 
<p>Plant growth, especially creepers, can cover up damp problems arising from 
unrelated building defects such as leaking gutters, downpipes or cistern 
overflow. The fact that damp problems go unnoticed, and hence uncorrected, is 
arguably the most serious of the potential problems caused by creeper growth on 
buildings</p> 
<p>Plant growth involves the transport of substantial quantities of water up 
from the roots to the leaves, where the water evaporates. Even in the hottest, 
dryest weather, the building is surrounded by a cool, damp envelope. In poorly 
insulated buildings prone to overheating, building occupants may see this as an 
advantage, and in hot damp weather, the effect on the building moisture balance 
may be positive</p> 
<p>While it may be true that a dense covering of leaves may repel light rain, 
it has been argued that the net effect of vegetation is to make the external 
walls of a building damper. In heavy or driven rain, vegetation does not 
prevent water penetration, but it can in principle impede water run-off, and by 
cutting out sunlight and impeding air circulation, vegetation can slow the 
drying off process when the rain has stopped. Without actual measurements it is 
not possible to establish the veracity of these claims</p> 
<p>Older buildings without damp proof courses depend on the evaporation of 
water from the surface of the masonry. Dense vegetation may impede this 
evaporation, causing dampness in the walls</p> 
<h4>Root damage and climbing plants</h4> 
<p>Inevitably, the roots of climbing plants will be close to the building, 
where they may damage masonry and foundations. Damage may include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>disturbance of foundations as a result of localised withdrawal of water 
from around the foundations</li> 
<li>physical displacement of foundations and masonry components as a result of 
the increasing girth of the roots</li> 
<li>penetration of joints and cracks in drains and water courses, leading to 
blockage or leakage - such penetration is usually the result of an underlying 
defect, eg the cracking of clay waste pipes as a result of ground movement</li> 
<li>Above ground physical damage from climbing plants</li> </ul> 
<p>Physical damage may include:</p> 
<p>fire risk. The leaves and stems of evergreen creepers such as ivy can burn 
fiercely, and enable a fire to be carried on the outside of a building to areas 
that might otherwise be unaffected by the fire. Deciduous creepers may build up 
dead leaves, birds' nests and other debris, with much the same effect</p> 
<p>storm damage. Creepers on the surface of a building marginally increase its 
wind resistance, and thus the likelihood of damage in a storm. Creepers may 
also be blown off in a storm, causing damage in their fall, or bringing with 
them items such as gutters or downpipes</p> 
<p>damage to surfaces. Creepers such as ivy put out rootlets which adhere 
strongly to the surface on which it is growing, and which may be very difficult 
to remove without either damaging the surface, or leaving highly visible areas 
of woody deposits. Paint is particularly vulnerable and may be stripped off by 
contact with ivy</p> 
<p>interference with drainage. Growth of creepers can block gutters and spouts 
and other rain drainage routes, leading to blockage and subsequent water 
penetration into the building. Deciduous creepers also deposit large quantities 
of leaves directly around the building</p> 
<p>displacement of building elements. The shoots of creepers can displace 
slates, coping stones, bricks and other elements, causing water penetration 
through roofs, water penetration into walls, and in extreme cases, creating a 
risk of masonry elements falling off</p> 
<p>problems with lofts. Creepers can block ventilation routes, either by 
growing through them or over them, or as a result of the build up of debris. 
Shoots growing into loft spaces may cause further damage in attempting to grow 
back towards the light</p> 
<p>pests. Creepers provide cover for all manner of animals which may cause a 
nuisance in buildings - flies, wasps and other insects, sites for birds to nest 
and roost, and parasites associated with this, and lead to periodic invasions 
of normally harmless creatures such as spiders. In addition, vegetation can 
provide high level access for rodent pests, which might have been successfully 
excluded at ground level</p> 
<p>General recommendations</p> 
<p>The growth of climbing plants on buildings may be desirable for aesthetic 
reasons, but there are no other proven benefits. If the building owner feels 
that the aesthetic benefit justifies the physical disadvantages, the following 
management steps must be taken:</p> 
<p>check the building detailing. Ensure that gutters and downpipes are firmly 
fixed and adequately sized. Ensure that cladding and other surface finishes are 
sound and firmly affixed</p> 
<p>choosing where to plant. Plant in clear ground, well away from drainage 
pipes or other water-containing services which may be damaged by root action</p>
<p>site preparation. Before considering planting, bear in mind that ground 
levels must be at least 150mm below dpc level, and that dpc bridging by plant 
stems, soil or debris must be avoided. Soil near buildings is seldom at its 
most fertile, and it may be necessary to import humus to enable healthy plant 
growth. As the plant grows, ground levels around it will tend to rise, for 
which allowance must be made. Often it will be necessary to dig out the soil 
first</p> 
<p>trimming. It is essential that the growth be regularly trimmed so that 
growth remains well away from windows, ventilators, areas of delicate finish, 
and well below the level of the eaves</p> 
<p>on no account must the building owner permit growth over gutters or roofs, 
or into the eaves or any other point of entry into the building</p> 
<p>large, well established rootstocks should be avoided as these are more 
likely to cause problems. Regular and drastic pruning above ground helps reduce 
the rate of increase in the diameter of roots</p>

</p> 
<h3>Weeds</h3> 
<p>A weed has been defined as a plant growing where it is not wanted. For 
present purposes, however we shall use the word for small herbaceous plants 
growing in a building environs. Unlike climbing plants, herbaceous plants are 
not generally wanted in or on a building, let alone introduced there, by the 
building owner</p> 
<p>Weeds are often a sign of other underlying building defects. Weeds may grow 
from seed in damp masonry, in accumulated debris in gutters, and other areas 
where ponding has occurred, such as flat roofs, and in yards and other exterior 
areas. Existing weeds in the ground, if not killed or removed before building 
work starts, may damage asphalt, masonry and even concrete in their attempt to 
grow out into the light</p> 
<h4>Weeds growing in masonry</h4> 
<p>Weed growth in masonry indicates chronic water ingress into the masonry, 
which has also resulted in deterioration of the mortar. Weeds, and as much 
mortar as is practicable must be removed, and sources of water ingress such as 
leaking downpipes, defective coping, defective flashing or roofing, should be 
rectified. When the masonry has dried out, and all signs of plant growth have 
ceased, the masonry should be properly pointed</p> 
<h4>Weeds growing in roofs and gutters</h4> 
<p>Weed growth in roofs and gutters indicates poor detailing or maintenance, 
resulting in ponding of water, or the build up of debris. Debris may build up 
as a result of bird action, and moss and other matter falling off roofs. Weed 
growth increases the rate at which soil and other debris accumulates. Weeds and 
the soil or debris in which they are growing should be removed during regular 
inspections, and any faults in the detailing should be rectified</p> 
<h4>Regrowth of existing weeds</h4> 
<p>Weeds with strong root or rhizome structures such as dandelion, dock, 
bindweed and ground elder can break through asphalt, paving and even concrete 
laid on top of them. Such rootstocks are difficult to remove by mechanical 
means. If they are present, long acting herbicides should be used.</p>

<h3>Mosses and lichens</h3> 
<p>The growth of mosses and lichens on buildings is frequently welcomed for 
aesthetic reasons. However, moss growth in particular may have a number of 
undesirable consequences:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>surface erosion - as a result of physical adhesion and chemical breakdown 
of surface by rootlets of moss</li> 
<li>water retention. Mosses in particular inhibit drying and retain moisture, 
increasing the chance of frost damage to masonry and roofing materials</li> 
<li>blockage of rain drainage channels. Moss falling off roofs can build up in 
gutters and block spouts and downpipes</li> 
<li>encouraging other plant growth. Mosses and lichens, and the build up of 
soil around them, can provide areas in which seeds of destructive building 
weeds such as Buddleia can germinate, and having germinated, cause serious 
damage to building facbric</li> </ul> 
<h3>Fungi and bacteria</h3> 
<p>Older classifications place fungi and bacteria in the plant kingdom, but 
they are now generally regarded as two separate kindoms, separate from both 
plants and animals. Apart from timber decay organisms, the main problems caused 
by bacteria and fungi in buildings are related to the health of the occupants

</p> 
<h3>Trees</h3> 
<p>Trees are sometimes regarded as a nuisance near buildings. They can be 
blamed for subsidence and heave, they can block drains and gutters with their 
leaves and occasionally as a result of root penetration, and they can attract 
the attentions of officialdom in the form of Tree Preservation Orders. On the 
other hand, trees have great amenity value, and they can protect a building 
against snow cover, and from the wind. Conifer trees to the north and deciduous 
trees to the south can help make a building warmer in winter and cooler in 
summer</p> 
<h4>Trees growing within buildings </h4> 
<h4>Trees and building structures </h4> 
<h4>Trees and ground water</h4> 
<p>Trees can draw large amounts of water from the ground around buildings. In 
areas of clay subsoil, the increased growth, or the removal of trees can 
contribute to the localised expansion or contraction of the clay, with possible 
harmful effects or subsidence or heave on a building structure</p> 
<h4>Trees growing close to buildings</h4> 
<p>Trees on balance enhance a good building, but they can also exacerbate a 
building's defects. Not entirely surprisingly, the issue is contentious</p> 
<h5>Trees growing close to buildings: benefits</h5> 
<p>Trees growing close to buildings can have beneficial effects:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>shelter from strong wind and driven rain, consequently reducing water 
penetration, wind borne erosion, interior draughts and hence heating bills</li> 
<li>protection of buildings from 'cold air drainage' at night </li> 
<li>shelter from the heat of the summer sun </li> 
<li>improved appearance and greater comfort, and an enhancement of the value 
of a building which more than offsets the possible financial disadvantages of 
the presence of trees in the proximity of a building</li> </ul> 
<h5>Trees growing close to buildings: risks</h5> 
<p>Trees growing close to buildings can have harmful effects:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>structural damage due to the removal (or the cessation of the removal) of 
groundwater</li> 
<li>structural damage due to the increase in the physical girth of the tree or 
of its major roots</li> 
<li>structural damage due to the tree, or part of the tree falling onto the 
building</li> 
<li>increased risk of lightning damage as a result the tree being higher than 
the building, and hence more likely to be struck. This can result in 
side-strikes from the tree to vulnerable parts of the building, and, in the 
case of more combustible trees such as conifers, there is also a definite risk 
of fire following a strike</li> 
<li>shading of the building from sunlight, rendering the building darker, 
colder and damper than it otherwise might be</li> 
<li>root penetration can severely damage drains, particularly older ceramic 
pipes with cement joints. Rootlets can penetrate and force open cracks in the 
pipe or its junctions, arising from ground movement or deterioration of the 
cement junctions, leading to both blockage and leakage of the drains</li> 
<li>blockage by dead leaves and other tree derived debris is one of the main 
reasons that gutters and downpipes become blocked, resulting in water 
overflowing into the building structure. Such blockage can arise for other 
reasons. If problems arise, the owner's first response should be not to remove 
the trees, but to provide adequate and properly maintained rain drainage systems
</li> 
<li>trees near buildings can provide a means of entry for rats and mice, and 
can attract roosting pest birds such as pigeons, starlings, sparrows and rooks
</li> 
<li>trees growing in built up areas can attract Tree Preservation Orders, 
which can restrict the building owner's options in exercising what he considers 
to be proper management of the trees. However, such orders are not applied 
unreasonably, and they do induce the owner to seek proper advice on the best 
means of managing the trees, rather than acting rashly on the strength of 
uninformed prejudice. Owners irritated by the restrictions posed by TPOs should 
remind themselves that trees imrpove the appearance of an area, and hence the 
value of the properties within it</li> </ul> 
<h4>Trees and legal responsibility</h4> 
<p>Landowners are responsible for the safety of the trees growing on their 
land. While it is accepted that trees may have hidden and unforeseeable 
defects, legal liability can apparently be established, if, with the benefit of 
hindsight, an expert arboriculturalist could reasonably have been expected to 
have observed the defect which caused the tree (or part of it) to fall. 
However, it would appear that the owner has an additional duty to observe and 
care for the trees - it is not enough merely to 'hire an expert to cover one's 
back'. A higher standard of expertise appears to be expected from knowledgeable 
and well funded bodies such as the National Trust, than is expected of private 
individuals</p> 
<h5>Trees and legal responsibility: case law</h5> 
<p>Landowners are liable for injuries caused by defective trees to persons 
entitled to access to the land. In &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt;, a boy was injured as a 
result of the collapse of a tree on which he was climbing</p> 
<p>In &lt;&lt;2&gt;&gt;, the bough of a tree overhanging a road fell and 
damaged a motor coach. The tree had been inspected the previous autumn by a 
competent woodman and no defect had been found. The defect was latent and could 
not have been noticed in a reasonable inspection</p> 
<p>Case &lt;&lt;3&gt;&gt;, a tree owned by the National Trust fell onto a road 
causing an accident which resulted in serious injury. The court held that the 
Trust had a 'special duty of care'. It was 'not expected that they should have 
the knowledge of an expert arboriculturalist, but something more than the 
ordinary countryman'. The Trust had employed experts to look at the trees, but 
some thinness of foliage and dieback had not been noticed 1. Cronin v Slough 
Corporation, 1975 2. Noble v Harrison, 1926 3. Quinn v Scott, 1965</p> 
<h5>Trees and legal responsibility: statutory provisions</h5> 
<p>Highway authorities may require owners to cut back trees or shrubs which 
grows over the highway, thus causing danger to or impeding the passage of 
vehicles or pedestrians. Similar provisions exist for trees, hedges or dead 
planting which damage the highway, or which make the highway dangerous by 
excluding the sun or the wind</p> 
<h5>Trees and legal responsibility: tree preservation orders</h5> 
<p>Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are made by local planning authorities 'in 
the interest of amenity'. TPOs prevent the cutting down, topping, lopping, 
uprooting, and deliberate damage or uprooting of trees without the consent of 
the local planning authority. Trees growing in conservation areas are given 
much the same statutory protection, even though they may not be individually 
listed for protection. Unlike TPO provisions, planning rules can enforce the 
planting of new trees, or the replacement of trees felled for whatever reason
</p> 
<p>There clearly comes a point when a seedling or a sapling becomes a tree, 
but this point was not defined in the TPO legislation. Lord Denning suggested 
during the case &lt;&lt;1&gt;&amp;gt that a tree be defined as having a main 
trunk diameter of six or seven inches</p> 
<p>The penalty for destroying or damaging trees protected by TPOs is a fine 
not exceeding &oelig;2000, or twice the value of the tree destroyed or damaged
</p> 
<p>There are exceptions to the rule, which allow the felling of protected 
trees:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the trees are dead or dying, unsafe, or have become statutory nuisances 
</li> 
<li>woodland schemes approved by the Forestry Commision </li> 
<li>trees cut down under a felling licence from the Forestry Commision </li> 
<li>tree on local authority land, felled with the local authority permission 
</li> 
<li>trees not exceeding 75mm in diameter </li> 
<li>trees not exceeding 100mm in diameter if removed to help the growth of 
other trees</li> </ul> 
<p>Although in these cases it is not necessary to inform the local authority 
of one's intention to fell or lop a tree, it is usually advisable to do so. It 
may, for example, be quite difficult to prove that a tree was dangerous once it 
has been cut down and removed. In the case of a protected tree suddenly 
requiring urgent attention, for example after a storm, the evidence of an 
expert, or failing that, photographic evidence, should be obtained</p> 
<p>It was noted that a disproportionately large number of trees subject to 
TPOs fell in the great 1987 storm. This was largely - but not entirely, on 
account of the greater average age of protected trees 1. Kent CC v Batchelor</p>
<h5>Trees and planning enforcement</h5> 
<p>The retention or planting of trees can form part of the conditions of the 
granting of planning consent, and can form part of the area plans in 
conservation areas. Planning restrictions are at once more and less binding 
than TPOs. TPOs refer to individual trees if the tree dies, or is destroyed, 
the landowner is under no obligation to replace it. With planning regulations, 
this is not necessarily the case, but on the other hand, the building owner may 
be obliged to replace the tree or trees, with similar ones</p>

<h4>Arboricultural Association method of evaluation of trees</h4> 
<p>For legal and accounting purposes, it is often necessary to calculate the 
amenity value of trees, using a system of points. This is based on a 
combination of measurable factors, such as girth, and subjective factors such 
as suitability for setting. Consequently, disagreement can be over whether a 
tree is worth say &oelig;300 or &oelig;400, but it is much less likely over 
whether a tree is worth &oelig;300 or &oelig;3000. This evaluation has little 
or no relation to the commercial value of the tree for its timber</p> 
<h4>The seven value factors</h4> 
<p>The following factors are used to make the analysis:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Size:</strong> 'small' (3 - 10m2), 'medium' (10 - 50m2), 'large' 
(50 - 200m2), and 'very large' (over 200m2)</li> 
<li><strong>Life expectancy:</strong> this depends on the age and type of 
tree, its position and its general state of health. An expert arboriculturalist 
may be required to assess this</li> 
<li><strong>Scenic importance:</strong> 'little' importance (trees in 
woodlands, in groups or in back gardens) 'some' importance (individual trees by 
roads, in parks) 'considerable' importance (prominent individual trees in town 
centres, sopping precincts etc) and 'great' importance (trees of crucial 
importance as main features in a public place)</li> 
<li><strong>Other trees present:</strong> 'many' (more than 10 trees in total 
or 30 per cent of the visual area covered by trees 'some' (4 to 9 trees in 
total or 10 per cent of the visual area covered by trees) 'few' (1 to 3 other 
trees present or less than 10 per cent of the visual area) and 'none' (no other 
trees present in the area under consideration)</li> 
<li><strong>Relation to setting:</strong> a largely aesthetic judgement, 
depending on the size of the tree in relation to its surrounding, species, 
form, general condition and its contribution to the landscape</li> 
<li>Form an aesthetic judgement, but fairly self evident - badly mutilated 
examples, or tree suffering from storm damage or disease are classed as 'poor', 
while particularly elegant or well maintained trees are 'good' to 'excellent'
</li> 
<li><strong>Special factors: </strong>these include matters such as unusual 
botanical or historical interest, rarity, or unique contribution to a 
landscape, such as the tree being part of an avenue, or the focal pont of a 
scene. Such trees may form an important part of the designation of a 
Conservation Area</li> </ol> 
<h4>Evaluation table for trees</h4> 
<p>To calculate the 'amenity value' of a tree, multiply all the points awarded 
to it together and then multiply the result by a conversion factor. In 1990, 
this was set at &oelig;10.00</p> 
<h3>Conversion Factor</h3> 
<h3>Points</h3> <br>
1 2 3 4 <br>
a Size Small Medium Large Very Large <br>
b 
Life expectancy 10-20 years 20-40 years 40-100 years Over 100 years <br>
c 
Scenic importance Little Some Considerable Great <br>
d Other trees Many Some 
Few None <br>
e Setting Just suitable Fairly suitable Very suitable Esp. 
suitable <br>
f Form Poor Fair Good Excellent <br>
g Special factors None One 
factor Two factors Three + factors <br>
<br>

<p>Thus a large (a=3 points) oak tree (g=1 point), life expectancy 200+ years 
(b=4 points), forms an important part (c=3 points) of an avenue (d=3 points) in 
a country house park (e=4 points). The tree is healthy and symmetrical, but has 
been slightly damaged by lightning (f=2 points). It therefore has an 'amenity 
value' of &oelig;10 x 3 x 1 x 4 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 2 = &oelig;8640. These points are 
shown highlighted in the table.</p> 
<p>Any tree which fails to score on any of the first five value factors is 
given a total amenity value of zero. Examples of such trees might be very 
small, very old, seriously rotten, or quite unsuitable for their surroundings.
