<h2>Soaking the Customer</h2> <br>

<p>By Wenonah Hauter</p> 
<p>Ruby Williams, a 78-year-old Aqua Pennsylvania customer, got stuck with 
a&nbsp;$40,000 water bill because of a serious leak in the pipes under her home 
in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. After her situation garnered national media 
attention, the private company agreed to reduce her bill to a few hundred 
dollars.</p> 
<p>Likewise, the Price family of Stallings, North Carolina recently had their 
sewage service cut off by Aqua North Carolina despite having paid an overdue 
bill. The company demanded $1,000 to restore it &mdash; hundreds of dollars 
more than the actual cost to do the work. Again, thanks to bad publicity and 
public outrage, Aqua backed down.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not just American consumers that feel the pinch as our municipal 
water systems change from public to private hands &mdash; and it&rsquo;s not 
just that Aqua America is one bad actor, either. Private interests worldwide 
increasingly control our water. Too often, customers are getting a raw deal.</p>

<h2>Is it Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Grand Canyon or Ours?</h2> <br>

<p>By Rich Bindell</p> 
<p>Anyone lucky enough to see the Grand Canyon should understand why Grand 
Canyon National Park officials wanted toinstitute a ban on the sale of bottled 
water in the park. Visitors to the park should be able to see the Canyon in its 
pristine condition, not littered with plastic bottles. But National Parks 
Service Director Jon Jarvis blocked the ban right before it took effect, and 
shortly after Coca-Cola made inquires about the ban. Since Coca-Cola is a major 
donor to the National Parks Foundation, contributing about $13 million in total 
to the Foundation and the Parks, we have to ask: how much influence should a 
corporate donor have on the operations decisions of an entity like National 
Parks Service?</p> 
<p>Stephen P. Martin, a Grand Canyon park official, developed the ban because 
30 percent of park waste is fromplastic bottles. In a place like a national 
park, a preserved location, protected from the usual scars (like garbage) left 
by human beings, this seems like a reasonable course of action to take. 
There&rsquo;s really no reason to object to any attempt to keep a national park 
free from excess waste.</p> 
<p>But, Coca-Cola sells its Dasani brand of bottled water to park visitors. 
The park&rsquo;s ban would include providing water stations for reusable 
bottles, but Coke would, of course, prefer people buy their product.</p> 
<p>When asked about the ban, Susan Stribling, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman, exposed 
a serious lack of understanding when it comes to waste and recycling. According 
to Stribling, Coca-Cola&rsquo;s strategy isn&rsquo;t to try to eliminate waste 
before it&rsquo;s created, but to provide recycling bins instead. She offered 
this ridiculous and preposterous response:Read the full article&hellip;</p>

<h2>Nestle Wants to Sell US Bottled Water?</h2> <br>

<p>Nestl&eacute;'s sales account managers should be more careful about their 
potential client list.</p> 
<p>By Rich Bindell</p> 
<p>Talk about an overly optimistic sales strategy.</p> 
<p>No fewer than six Food &amp; Water Watch staff members received emails from 
a salesman with a Nestle affiliated bottled water brand over the past few 
weeks, asking if we&rsquo;d be interested in purchasing their bottled water and 
various products and services for our office.</p> 
<p>Clearly, this salesperson did not do his homework. If he had, he would have 
figured out pretty quickly what we think aboutbottled water.</p> 
<p>After several emails around the office discussing this ill-conceived sales 
maneuver, I decided to respond&hellip;</p>

<h2>Photo of the Day: Whole Foods Suggests Brewing Coffee with Bottled Water
</h2> <br>

<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>Whole Foods recommends using bottled water when you brew their coffee. </p> 
<p>By Darcey Rakestraw</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a common practice for brands to cross-market its products on 
labels, but I have to say this is a blunder: Whole Foods suggests on its 
&ldquo;365 Brand&rdquo; coffee label that people brew it using its 365 Brand 
bottled water. (Thanks to our office manager Ben Schumin for the pic.)</p> 
<p>Coming from a company that has a &ldquo;green mission&rdquo;&mdash;during a 
time of economic crisis, no less&mdash;this seems particularly tone deaf. No 
doubt it will give Whole Foods naysayers more fodder for calling itWhole 
Paycheck, since bottled water is thousands of times more expensive than tap 
water. It also creates mountains of garbage, with less than 25 percent of 
plastic bottles getting recycled. Plus it isa waste of fossil fuels in 
production and transport, using the equivalent of 32 and 54 million barrels of 
oil in 2007&mdash;enough to fuel about 1.5 million cars for a year.</p> <strong>

<h2>Through Art, the Value of Water Expressed</h2> <br>

<p>The most common chemical compound on earth, water, is everywhere. 
We&rsquo;re familiar with water&rsquo;s diverse natural expressions from fog, 
rain, streams and rivers to oceans, lagoons, groundwater and springs. In a 
special appearance, water flows through the Cathedral of St. John the 
Divine&rsquo;s<em>The Value of Water: Sustaining a Green Planet</em> exhibit, 
which runs until March 25, 2012. The exhibit &ndash; of which GRACE is a 
sponsor &ndash; is part of an ongoing endeavor by the Cathedral to promote the 
theme of water throughits various programs and events.</p> 
<p>A few Ecocentric bloggers attended <em>the Value of Water</em> opening on 
September 22, and were happy to see an impressive turnout of 1,500 guests.</p> 
<p>As part of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, the Cathedral has a strong 
tradition of unifying people from various backgrounds, religions and faiths to 
address concerns of social justice, poverty and education. In that tradition, 
the Cathedral clergy and staff have been considering the powerful role water 
plays in these issues.Read the full article&hellip;</p> <strong>Posted in

<h2>Will Portland State University be Bottled Water-Free Within Five Years?
</h2> <br>

<p>By Rich Bindell</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to get some good news in the form of a small but important 
victory from the field:Pacific University has banned the sale of bottled water. 
Starting in August, no one will be able to purchasebottled water on campus or 
accessbottled water through official university functions. Congratulations to 
the students and alumni who made it happen!</p> 
<p>Even though Pacific University is a smaller school than, let&rsquo;s say, 
Portland State University (PSU), this is still a great win for water advocates 
across the country. Why make the comparison between the two schools? Sometimes 
you have to read between the lines to get to the heart of the story.Read the

<h2>The Next Big Thing In Industry: Water Profiteering</h2> <br>

<p>Executive Director Wenonah Hauter got the inside scoop on what the water 
industry is up to at the 2011 Global Water Summit in Berlin.</p> 
<p>Last week I was in Berlin at the Global Water Summit 2011, a meet up for 
corporations that want to profit from water as it becomes scarcer. Sponsored by 
all the bad actors in the water industry, from Veolia to General Electric, the 
conference URL was www.watermeetsmoney.com. Even the Koch Brothers&rsquo; 
empire was represented (Koch Industries helped pollute water with its fossil 
fuel operations, so why not profit also from cleaning up the mess?)</p> 
<p>My colleague, Anil Naidoo from the Council of Canadians, and I were invited 
to the meeting to debate the libertarian economist David Zetland and William 
Muhairwe, managing director of Uganda&rsquo;s national water company. Both 
Zetland and Muhairwe are big proponents of full-cost pricing and dismissive of 
the government&rsquo;s role in providing water.</p> 
<p>Some may wonder why Anil and I would go there to debate, especially when 
the audience was comprised of people employed in the water industry. The truth 
is that there is no better place to really figure out what they are up to. An 
hour debate was a small price to pay for free entrance to the $2,500.00 event 
that gave us real insight into the newest plans of the global water cartel.Read

<h2>Is Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Pure Life Brand a Threat to Public Water?</h2> 
<br> 
<p>Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s Pure Life Brand could be a major threat to public 
water and to water as a human right. Read our report: Hanging on for Pure Life 
to find out what Nestl&eacute; is doing to position itself for the future.</p> 
<p>In 2008, bottled water sales in the United States experienced a decline 
&mdash; one that lasted for two consecutive years. This was good news for water 
advocates, and bad news for the bottled water industry. Many believe this 
decline was due to a combination of a troubled economy and a growing consumer 
consciousness about bottled water&rsquo;s negative environmental impacts. But, 
while the entire industry reported losses, one bottled water brand stood alone 
with increased sales: Nestl&eacute; Waters&rsquo; Pure Life.</p> 
<p>But what allowed this brand to shine in an otherwise challenging 
marketplace for bottled water? Was it brilliant marketing, or does the Pure 
Life brand represent something more than just a bottled water product?Read the

<h2>Teaching the Tap Today to Protect Water for Tomorrow</h2> <br>

<p>The Take Back the Tap Curriculum is designed to teach kids about the 
importance of protecting our most essential public resource: water.</p> 
<p>A great way to prepare to face the challenges of the future is to invest 
today in the knowledge of tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders. Thus, on thisWorld Water Day
, Food &amp; Water Watch is happy to launch a special initiative developed to
teach the next generation about how to protect our water resources. The <em>
Take Back the Tap Curriculum</em> is designed to educate young students about 
the critical importance of defending water as a public resource and to 
demonstrate the negative impact of bottled water on the environment and the 
community.Read the full article&hellip;</p> <strong>Posted in</strong> Bottled

<h2>Bells and Whistles Can Distract Consumers From the Truth</h2> <br>

<p>Net pens, used for factory fish farming, are destructive to the marine 
environment. Even if you change their shape and keep them underwater, they are 
still destructive to the marine environment.</p> 
<p>Coke&rsquo;s Dasani brand has introduced a new kind of plastic bottle, 30 
percent of which is made from plant-based materials. (Please explorethis 
phenomenon further via Jennifer Grayson&rsquo;s blog at The Red, White and 
Green.) The ad declares that the bottle is made with &ldquo;100 percent 
recyclability.&rdquo; This, of course, refers to the idea of consumers placing 
their empty water bottles into a recycling bin to be reconstituted for further 
use at a later time. But, if only 25 percent of plastic bottles actually reach 
the recycling bin, does 100 percent recyclability have much meaning? I think it 
does &mdash; it&rsquo;s meaning is to distract consumers fromhow damaging the 
product is to the environment, especially since the remaining 75 percent of 
plastic bottles end up in landfills.</p> 
<p>Seeing an ad with a vibrant green plant blooming into a plastic bottle from 
the heart of its lovely pedals is enough to convince many consumers that a 
product is eco-friendly, but it&rsquo;s merely a distraction. It&rsquo;s up to 
us to know that the product within that fancy, useless bottle is actually 
something that already belongs to us, regardless of what kind of bottle is used 
to contain it. Plant bottle or plastic bottle, buying bottled water is 
destructive and not at all necessary.Read the full article&hellip;</p> <strong>
