<p><strong>Acid Rain:</strong> Rain water that has a lower pH (acidic) as a 
result of sulfur gases being released into the atmosphere from the burning of 
coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Aquifer:</strong> An underground rock formation that can hold water.
</p>
<p><strong>Chlorination:</strong> The process by which chlorine is added to 
water during treatment in order to kill harmful microorganisms.</p>
<p><strong>Chlorine:</strong> One of the most common chemicals used in the 
treatment of public water supplies because it is highly effective in killing 
harmful microorganisms.</p>
<p><strong>Condensation:</strong> The process by which water vapor collects 
into clouds of tiny water droplets in the cooler atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Methods of using water wisely with the 
minimum amount of water being wasted.</p>
<p><strong>Contaminant:</strong> Any substance found in water that may be 
harmful to water consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Contamination:</strong> The introduction of a harmful substance 
into the water either at the supply or during distribution. Contamination can 
occur naturally or by the hands of humans.</p>

<p><strong>Drought:</strong> A period of lower-than-normal precipitation that 
can lead to a water shortage.</p>
<p><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The process by which water from the earth's 
surface is transported into the atmosphere as it turns from liquid to gas.</p>
<p><strong>Filtration:</strong> The process by which organic and inorganic 
particles are removed from the raw water.</p>
<p><strong>Groundwater:</strong> Any source of water that is found beneath the 
earth's surface in an aquifer.</p>
<p><strong>Hardness:</strong> The texture of water that contains high levels 
of harmless metals such as magnesium and calcium. The term called &quot;hard 
water&quot; is used because it's &quot;hard&quot; to get lather from soap and 
shampoo when using this water.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrologic Cycle:</strong> Also called the Water Cycle. This is the 
natural cycle of water, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, 
precipitation and percolation.</p>
<p><strong>Intake:</strong> The part of a surface water treatment facility 
where water from a lake, river or stream is drawn into the plant for 
filtration, treatment and distribution to customers.</p>
<p><strong>Lead: </strong>A metal that is harmful to infants and children if 
swallowed. An older home containing lead pipes could contribute to increased 
lead levels in the home's tap water.</p>
<p>Back to top </p>
<p><strong>Percolation:</strong> The process by which precipitation 
replenishes groundwater sources. After a period of rain, snow, sleet or hail, 
water will flow through soil and rock to reach underground aquifers.</p>
<p><strong>Potable Water: </strong>Water that is safe to drink after the raw 
water has gone through the filtration and treatment process.</p>
<p><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Any form of water falling from clouds down 
to earth, which replenishes water supplies. This includes rain, snow, hail, 
sleet and freezing rain.</p>
<p><strong>Private Well:</strong> A well that is intended to provide water to 
a single home or building.</p>
<p><strong>Public Water Supply:</strong> Water provided to a group of homes or 
an entire city through a water utility via underground pipes and water mains.
</p>
<p><strong>Raw Water:</strong> The water from a surface water or groundwater 
source prior to filtration or treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Recharge Area:</strong> An area of land that allows rainwater to 
percolate into the earth's surface to replenish groundwater sources.</p>
<p><strong>Recharge: </strong>The increase in groundwater levels after 
rainwater soaks into the ground and into an aquifer.</p>
<p>Back to top </p>
<p><strong>Reservoir:</strong> A man-made storage area for water. Sometimes a 
reservoir will be open, like a man-made lake, or it may be a fully enclosed 
tank, either above-ground or underground.</p>
<p><strong>Service Lateral:</strong> A pipe that runs underground from a home 
or building to a water utility's water main in order to provide that home or 
building with public water.</p>
<p><strong>Surface Water:</strong> Any source of water that is found on top of 
the earth's surface, such as a lake, river or stream.</p>
<p><strong>Transpiration:</strong> The process by which plants produce water 
vapor which is released into the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment:</strong> The process by which substances are added to 
the water in order to make it safe to drink or look and taste better.</p>
<p><strong>Water Main:</strong> The underground pipe used to transport potable 
water from a water utility to your home.</p>
<p><strong>Water Meter:</strong> A device that records the amount of water 
being used in your home. Your water utility checks your water meter regularly 
because your water bill is based on how much water you use.</p>
<p><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Usually referring to the introduction of 
a harmful substance into the water supply as a result of human actions.</p>
<p><strong>Water Softener:</strong> A device used within the home to reduce 
the hardness of the water.</p>
<p><strong>Watershed: </strong>Also called a Drainage Basin. This is an area 
of land that allows rainwater to flow into creeks, streams and rivers.</p>
