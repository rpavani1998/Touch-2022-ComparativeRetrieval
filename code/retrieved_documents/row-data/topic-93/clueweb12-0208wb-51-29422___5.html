<h1>Soft water: healthier plumbing, <br>
 healthier appliances, healthier you!
</h1> 
<p>Hard water is more than an irritation. Hard water clings to everything 
leaving clothes looking dingy, plates and glasses dirty and streaked. Even 
pipes and water heaters and appliances life is reduced.</p> 
<p> Soft water makes your hair and skin softer. Your clothes won't lose color 
nor look dingy and last longer. Soft water removes all soap particles from the 
water. Household chores are easier, look cleaner and streak-free.</p> 
<p>Since the early 1900's, water softener maintenance, repair and installation 
have been a part of our business. PDM Soft Water Doctors understand water 
softener operation and can help with any water softener repair, maintenance or 
installation for your home or business.</p> 
<h2>A new water softener makes a huge difference. <br>
 Life&rsquo;s a whole 
lot easier without hard water</h2> 
<h5>You&rsquo;ll be surprised how soft your skin and hair will feel after your 
first shower.</h5> 
<ul> 
<li> Softer hair and skin.</li> 
<li>Soap lathers and rinses easier - A water softener allows you to use 1/3 
less detergent for towels, and they can come out of the wash 45% whiter.</li> 
<li>Enjoy the look and feel of clothes and fabrics. Softer, brighter and last 
longer.</li> 
<li>Appliances are easier to clean and last longer. No more unsightly rings, 
stains or mineral build-up to darken your sinks and tubs or your day.</li> 
<li>Less hard water mineral will build up in water appliances and pipes. This 
improves energy efficiency in water heaters up to 25%, and equipment lasts 
longer.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Many clients install a water softener for hot water, allowing for 
use of non-softened water on the lawn, for car washing, and for any cleaning or 
watering job that needs cold water alone.</li> </ul>

<h3>Water Softener FAQ</h3> 
<h4> What is hard water? </h4> 
<p>Hard water contains large amounts of calcium and magnesium and sometimes 
&acirc;&#128;&#148; dissolved from the soil by rainwater. Calcium causes most 
of the visible water problems you see on sinks, tubs and glasses. Hard water is 
generally not harmful.</p> 
<p> The severity of water hardness is measured by mineral grains per gallon 
(GPG). Rain water is naturally soft or 0 grains. Anything over 3.5 GPG is 
considered hard</p> 
<h4>Is softened water safe to drink?</h4> 
<p>According to Mayo Clinic... &quot;the amount of sodium a water softener 
adds to tap water depends on the &quot;hardness&quot; of the water. The best 
way to decrease your sodium intake is by cutting back on table salt and 
processed foods. But the water from your tap also may add a significant amount 
of sodium to your diet.&quot;</p> 
<p>PDM normally connects your new softener to your hot water supply. That way 
you reduce the amount of softened water needed. You then can use unsoftened 
cold water for drinking, cooking and watering plants.</p> 
<h4> How much salt to add?</h4> 
<p> Check your storage tank once a month. Keep the salt level at least 
half-full at all times for a good supply of soft water. Remember, just because 
the tank is full of salt doesn't mean your water will be more salty. The tank 
is simply for salt storage.</p> 
<h4> Which softener salt should I use and can I mix different types of water 
softener salts?</h4> 
<p>Rock salt has a lot of matter that is not water-soluble meaning the 
softening reservoirs have to be cleaned more often. Rock salt is cheaper than 
evaporated salt and solar salt, but you'll have more maintenance to do.</p> 
<p> Solar salt contains a bit more water-insoluble matter than evaporated 
salt. If salt usage is low, you could change from one product to another.</p> 
<p>If salt usage is high, insoluble salts will build up faster when using 
solar salt. Evaporated salt requires less maintenance.</p> 
<h4> What is a water softener salt bridge?</h4> 
<p>A hard crust of salt can form between the water and the salt. Humidity or 
the wrong salt can cause the salt bridge. Salt won&rsquo;t dissolve in the 
water to make brine. Without brine, the resin bed does not regenerate and you 
will have hard water.</p> 
<p> Solution: If your salt/brine tank is full of salt, it is hard to know if 
you have a salt bridge. Salt may be loose on top, but the salt bridge is hiding 
below. Take a broom handle, and push it straight down into the salt. If a hard 
object is felt, you probably hit a salt bridge. Carefully push broom handle 
into the bridge in several places to break it.</p> 
<p>DO NOTE USE SHARP OR POINTED TOOL &acirc;&#128;&#147; you could puncture 
your tank and cause leak.</p>

<h3>How does a water softener remove hard water?</h3> 
<p> Simply put, in a water softener, hard water calcium and magnesium minerals 
change form by soaking up the salt's sodium.</p> 
<p> A water softener collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank 
and from time to time flushes them down the drain. The result is no more ring 
around the tub and spotted glasses, softer skin, cleaner looking fabrics and a 
whole lot more.</p> 
<p>Over time water mineral scale can form to clog your pipes, restrict water 
flow and water pressure can be reduced. Water softener can help remove hard 
water scale.</p>
