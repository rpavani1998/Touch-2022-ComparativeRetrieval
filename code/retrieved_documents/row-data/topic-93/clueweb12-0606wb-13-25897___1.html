<h1>Is Bottled Water Better?</h1> 
<p>Greentips: June 2007</p> 
<p>Bottled water manufacturers&rsquo; marketing campaigns capitalize on 
isolated instances of contaminated public drinking water supplies by 
encouraging the perception that their products are purer and safer than tap 
water. But the reality is that tap water is actually held to more stringent 
quality standards than bottled water, and some brands of bottled water are just 
tap water in disguise. What&rsquo;s more, our increasing consumption of bottled 
water&mdash;more than 22 gallons per U.S. citizen in 2004 according to the 
Earth Policy Institute&mdash;fuels an unsustainable industry that takes a heavy 
toll on the environment.</p> 
<p><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>Fossil fuel consumption</em></strong>. Approximately 17 million 
barrels of oil&mdash;enough to run 1 million cars for a whole year&mdash;are 
used to make plastic water bottles, according to the Pacific Institute. The 
burning of oil and other fossil fuels (which are also used to generate the 
energy that powers the manufacturing process) emits global warming pollution 
into the atmosphere.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Water consumption</em></strong>. The growth in bottled water 
production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, 
leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In 
addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making 
process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every 
gallon that goes into the bottles.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Waste</em></strong>. Only about 10 percent of water bottles are 
recycled, leaving the rest in landfills where it takes thousands of years for 
the plastic to decompose.</p> 
<p><strong>The Simple (and Cheaper) Solution</strong></p> 
<p>The next time you feel thirsty, forgo the bottle and turn to the tap. 
You&rsquo;ll not only lower your environmental impact but also save 
money&mdash;bottled water can cost up to 10,000 times more per gallon than tap 
water. And because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s standards 
for tap water are more stringent than the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s 
standards for bottled water, you&rsquo;ll be drinking water that is just as 
safe as, or safer than, bottled.</p> 
<p>If, however, you don&rsquo;t like the taste of your tap water or are unsure 
of its quality, you can buy a filter pitcher or install an inexpensive faucet 
filter to remove trace chemicals and bacteria. If you will be away from home, 
fill a reusable bottle from your tap and refill it along the way; travel 
bottles with built-in filters are also available. Finally, limit your bottled 
water purchases for those times when you&rsquo;re traveling in countries where 
water quality is questionable.</p> Last Revised: 06/15/07 <br>
