Water Conservation &gt; Household Water Conservation Tips <br>

<h1> Household Water Conservation Tips</h1> 
<h2> Kitchen Tips</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Install a low-flow faucet aerator, which can cut water use in half.</li> 
<li> Soak pots and pans before washing. When washing dishes by hand, fill one 
sink or basin with soapy water.</li> 
<li> Fill the basin or a pan with water to wash fruits and vegetables.</li> 
<li> Cook food in as little water as possible. This will also retain more of 
the nutrients.</li> 
<li> Keep a pitcher of water in the refrigerator rather than running tap water 
until it is cool enough to drink.</li> 
<li> When buying a new dishwasher, consider purchasing a water-saving model.
</li> 
<li> Wash only full loads in the dishwasher.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Bathroom Tips</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Check regularly for any leaks and fix them. Most common bathroom leaks 
are found in faucets and in and around toilets. Put food coloring in your 
toilet tank. If it seeps into the toilet bowl, you have a leak.</li> 
<li> Replace older, larger-use toilets with the newer ultra-low or dual flush 
models.</li> 
<li> Take a five-minute shower.</li> 
<li> Use the minimum amount of water needed for a bath by closing the drain 
and the filling the tub only 1/3 full.</li> 
<li> Install a low-flow showerhead. It can save about half the amount of water 
you typically use in the shower, while still providing a refreshing, cleansing 
shower.</li> 
<li> Turn the tap water off while brushing your teeth, shaving, or washing 
your face.</li> 
<li> Teach your children to turn the faucets off tightly after each use.</li> 
</ol> 
<h2> Laundry Room Tips</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> When buying a new clothes washer, consider purchasing a water-saving 
model.</li> 
<li> Wash only full loads in the clothes washer.</li> 
<li> Insulate your water pipes. You will get hot water faster plus avoid 
wasting water while it heats up.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Outdoor Tips</h2> 
<p> In the summer, lawn watering and other outdoor uses can account for a 
large percent of home water use. Studies show that as much as half of this 
outdoor use is wasteful.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Do not overwater your landscape. It can cause yellowing leaves or poor 
plant health. Give plants only the amount of water that they need.</li> 
<li> Set sprinklers to water the lawn, not sidewalks and driveways.</li> 
<li> Check your sprinkler or irrigation systems regularly for any leaks, and 
fix them.</li> 
<li> Be sure your hose has an automatic shutoff nozzle to ensure water is not 
wasted when the hose is left unattended.</li> 
<li> Use a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway or sidewalk and save 
water every time.</li> 
<li> We are more likely to notice leaky faucets indoors, but do not forget to 
check outdoor faucets, pipes, and hoses for leaks.</li> 
<li> Use a rain barrel - Collect rain water in an old barrel or other large 
container that is outfitted with a tap and a suitable cover, and use the water 
on your garden. Use this water as an alternative to turning on the hose for 
newly transplanted material, window boxes, flower pots and container gardens. 
Rain water is actually better for your plants as it does not contain any 
chlorine and is at ambient temperature. Keep your rain barrel covered to 
prevent mosquitoes breeding and for safety reasons.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Planting</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Add two to four inches of organic material, such as peat or compost, to 
the soil. Greater soil depth will increase the ability of the soil to retain 
moisture.</li> 
<li> Think about ecoscaping your yard. What is ecoscaping? Ecoscaping combines 
healthy soil with native and drought-tolerant plants, trees and shrubs to 
create attractive, low maintenance, and water efficient landscapes which leave 
a small environmental footprint.</li> 
<li> Use native and adaptive plants; they will use less water and be resistant 
to local plant diseases and pests.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Car Washing</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Using a running hose to wash your car can waste water. Using a bucket 
with a sponge plus a trigger nozzle on the hose will save water.</li> </ol> 
<h2> Encourage Change!!</h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Encourage your school system and local government to help develop and 
promote a water conservation ethic among children and adults.</li> 
<li> Encourage your friends and neighbours to be part of a water-conscious 
community.</li> 
<li> Make suggestions to your employer to save water (and dollars) at work.
</li> 
<li> Do one thing each day that will save water. Even if savings are small, 
every drop counts!</li> </ol> <br>
