<h5>Why am I receiving this report?</h5> 
<p>As part of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (USEPA) wants to make certain that every consumer of tap 
water in the USA has information on the water you are drinking.</p> 
<h5>Bottom line&hellip; what does it say? I don&rsquo;t have time to read the 
whole thing, and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll understand it.</h5> 
<p>The report tells you, basically, how your water is treated, where it comes 
from &ndash; Potomac or Patuxent rivers - and the range and level of detection 
of any of the nearly 200 substances we test for in the water.</p> 
<h5>How can I find out about ALL of the parameters for which you test?</h5> 
<p>Our complete Tap Analysis&nbsp;is available by clicking right here.</p> 
<h5>How does our water compare to neighboring water utilities &ndash; 
especially northern Virginia?</h5> 
<p>Because most utilities in the area draw from the same source &ndash; the 
Potomac River - and use similar treatment processes, there is little difference.
</p> 
<h5>Is my tap water safe to drink? Should I drink bottled water instead?</h5> 
<p>Your tap water is very safe to drink. At WSSC, we have never had a 
violation of any of the water quality standards set byUSEPA. The standards for 
bottled water are set by theFood and Drug Administration and it undergoes much 
less stringent testing than does tap water. It, too, can be expected to contain 
trace amounts of some contaminants.</p> 
<h5>How often do you test the water?</h5> 
<p>Frequency of analysis depends on the parameter or contaminant being 
measured. Some are measured constantly in real time. Others are monitored 
hourly, or daily, or weekly, and so forth. For example, dozens of samples per 
day are tested for bacteria, but some rare exotic pesticides are monitored 
merely quarterly.</p> 
<h5>Can I use my tap water to make my baby&rsquo;s formula?</h5> 
<p>Because infants are particularly vulnerable to any organism in the water, 
the USEPA recommends that water used for baby&rsquo;s formula be boiled before 
it is used.</p> 
<h5>Is my water safe for bathing and washing clothes?</h5> 
<p>Yes, unconditionally so.</p> 
<h5>Do you test for cryptosporidium?</h5> 
<p>We monitored our Potomac and Patuxent source waters on a monthly or twice 
per month basis between October 2006 and September 2008 as required by EPA. The 
results of this monitoring indicated that our Cryptosporidium levels in both of 
our source waters are at low levels and that we do not need additional 
treatment to address the risk associated with these levels. We also conducted 
some special monitoring during the same period researching sources of 
Cryptosporidium within the Potomac watershed, which we've used to help focus 
source protection programs we are working on with regional partners. Currently, 
we are not routinely monitoring for Cryptosporidium based on the fact that our 
risk appears low and because we are not required to do so, but we are planning 
for an additional two years of monitoring beginning in 2015 as required by EPA.
</p> 
<p>In spite of the low risk, as an extra precaution WSSC is taking the most 
important steps in protecting against Cryptosporidium, which include 
maintaining effective coagulation and filtration processes in our water 
treatment plants as well as adding UV disinfection equipment to both our water 
treatment plants.</p> 
<h5>Is my water soft or hard?</h5> 
<p>Most of our customers receive their water from the Potomac Water Filtration 
Plant, and that water tends to be moderately hard. If you live in Laurel, 
Greenbelt or Beltsville, you are probably drinking water from the Patuxent 
Water Filtration Plant. That water tends to be more soft. Customers living in 
the hatched area on the map, roughly Silver Spring to Landover, are receiving a 
blend of the water from both plants.</p> 
<h5>Why does my water smell bleachy or musty?</h5> 
<p>Due to rain, ice and snowstorms, river conditions can produce strong 
bleachy odors and musty/earthy odors. The strong bleachy odor is not an 
indication of increased chlorine. The odor is a result of the combination of 
the chlorine used to disinfect and ammonia in the runoff water (rain, melting 
snow and ice) producing chloramines. Chloramines are not harmful and in fact 
are used by some utilities as the primary disinfectant. However, under certain 
circumstances, chloramines produce a very strong bleachy odor. There are no 
adverse health affects from the odor.</p> <br>
