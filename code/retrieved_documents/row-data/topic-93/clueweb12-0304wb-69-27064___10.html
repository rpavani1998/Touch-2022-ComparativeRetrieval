<h1>Bottled water and problems that flow</h1>  Posted in

<li>Water</li> </ul> 
<p>Having just spent several weeks in the United States, I can report with 
confidence that, more than ever before, Americans have their hands full.<br>
In 
fact, it's a wonder they get anything done at all. With a cell phone in one 
hand and a bottle of water or a cup of coffee in the other, they are also 
lugging groceries, messing with Blackberries, reading paperbacks and driving 
cars all more or less simultaneously.</p> 
<p>Such extremes of multitasking no longer surprise me, and since Americans 
have always loved to chat, cell phones are a natural extension of that passion. 
In Japan, too, shoals of train passengers and pedestrians using keitai (cell 
phones) are the norm, but Japanese seem to prefer sending text messages than 
talking on their phones.</p> 
<p>I've also become used to the American fondness for toting drinks while 
walking, shopping and driving: mugs of tea, boutique coffees, super-size-me 
sodas, kid-friendly juice packs and all manner of fluorescent-colored sports 
drinks.</p> 
<p>But what caught my eye this time was the bottled-water craze.</p> 
<p>For years people have been drinking spring water, mineral water and 
sparkling water, but what used to be a modest health trend has mutated into a 
worrisome marketing scam.</p> 
<p>Convenience stores and supermarkets now carry a dozen or more water 
products at prices that run as high as similar-sized bottles of soda. 
Similarly, Coca-Cola vending machines sell cola, orange soda, and Coca-Cola's 
Dasani brand of water -- all at $ 1.50.</p> 
<p>I may be old-fashioned, but this strikes me as a rip-off. After all, colas 
and other sodas are made with water plus sugar, coloring, flavoring and other 
chemicals. Hence they inevitably ought to cost more to produce than filtered 
tap water.</p> 
<p>But Dasani is filtered tap water. Which means Coca-Cola is charging the 
same price for water as it is for water-based products that have considerable 
value added.</p> 
<p>Clearly someone appears to be laughing all the way to their shareholders'
<br>meetings.</p> 
<p>According to Tony Clarke, author of &quot;Inside the Bottle: An Expose of 
the Bottled Water Industry,&quot; published in 2005, &quot;As the senior vice 
president of Nestle Waters' Global Marketing and Communications Division puts 
it: 'We sell water . . . so we've got to be clever.' &quot;</p> 
<p>Clarke is director of the Polaris Institute, an Ottawa-based organization 
that, as its mission statement declares, develops tools for research, education 
and action to help citizens' groups bring about democratic social change and 
challenge the power of corporations in the making of public policy.</p> 
<p>Selling water, it seems, is not about marketing a value-added product. It 
is about selling an image -- much like a real-estate agent peddling a mirage.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Inside the Bottle,&quot; downloadable from the Internet, offers a 
close-up look at this mirage, and how the Big Four drinks companies in North 
America -- Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestle and Danone (Dannon in the U.S.) -- are 
getting rich selling water taken from public water supplies -- and convincing 
us that we are better off buying what once was ours for free.</p> 
<p>According to Clarke, a 1999 study by the U.S.-based Natural Resources 
Defense Council, titled &quot;Bottled Water: Pure Drink or Pure Hype?,&quot; 
estimates that &quot;bottled water is between 240 and 10,000 times more 
expensive than tap water. This, despite the fact that tap water, with very few 
exceptions, is a safe form of drinking water in Canada and the United 
States.&quot;</p> 
<p>Expensive or not, sales of bottled water in North America are now the 
fastest-growing segment of the beverage industry.</p> 
<p>In the past 10 years, &quot;consumption of bottled water has more than 
doubled in the U.S. alone, while in Canada it now outpaces that of coffee, tea, 
apple juice or milk,&quot; according to &quot;Inside the Bottle.&quot;</p> 
<p>In this report, Clarke levels 10 charges against Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestle 
and Danone that will change forever the way you view those seemingly benign 
bottles of water that line convenience store shelves. Below are a few of his 
main concerns.</p> 
<p>One of the most egregious sins of the Big Four companies that he identifies 
is price gouging.</p> 
<p>Clarke calls the price markup on bottled water &quot;astonishing,&quot; 
considering that Coca-Cola and Pepsi &quot;draw the water for their products 
directly from municipal taps.&quot; Even more shocking is that Danone and 
Nestle &quot;pay little or nothing for the water they take out of groundwater 
streams and aquifers,&quot; he adds.</p> 
<p>Another of Clarke's key concerns is the transformation of water. 
&quot;Unlike other raw materials such as timber, minerals, oil and gas, which 
are transformed into identifiably new products, bottled water is simply water 
transformed into water [emphasis in original].</p> 
<p>&quot;The industry's treatment processes do not guarantee that bottled 
water is safer than tap water; in fact, a number of studies have demonstrated 
that bottled water is often less safe than tap water,&quot; says the report.</p>
<p>Hence contamination is also a concern.</p> 
<p>&quot;Several peer-reviewed scientific studies have found disturbing 
concentrations of toxic ingredients such as arsenic and mercury in their 
bottled-water samplings,&quot; warns Clarke, who adds that &quot;bottling 
plants face inspections only once every three-to-six years depending on the 
country, and regulations governing tap water are often stricter than those 
governing bottled water.&quot;</p> 
<p>Exploding use of plastic bottles is yet another concern.</p> 
<p>&quot;These containers release highly dangerous toxic chemicals and 
contaminants into the air and water when they are manufactured, and again when 
they are burned or buried. Yet these same plastic packages are becoming the 
fastest-growing form of municipal solid waste in the U.S. and Canada,&quot;<br>

Clarke notes.</p> 
<p>To make matters worse, the Big Four &quot;actively oppose legislation aimed 
at improving recycling rates for plastic bottles and requiring beverage 
container deposits,&quot; he adds.</p> 
<p>Two more closely related problems are declining support for public water 
and corporate interest in privatizing water supplies.</p> 
<p>&quot;Ten years ago, most people relied on their municipal system for all 
their drinking water. Today, close to one-fifth of the population in Canada and 
the U.S. drinks bottled water exclusively -- demonstrating how extraordinarily 
successful the industry has been in luring people away from tap water,&quot; 
Clarke notes.</p> 
<p>This switch is setting the stage for corporations to profit from taking 
over control of public water supplies. According to &quot;Inside the 
Bottle,&quot; the world's largest for-profit water-service corporations, such 
as Suez and Vivendi (now Veolia) from France, and German-based RWE-Thames, are 
eager to privatize water.</p> 
<p>&quot;The bottled-water industry's marketing of 'safe, clean water' 
undermines citizen's confidence in public water systems, and paves the way for 
the water companies to take over underfunded local utilities. In return, public 
willingness to pay premium prices for bottled water enables water-service 
corporations to establish a top-dollar price,&quot; warns Clarke.</p> 
<p>How clever: Setting us up to pay through the nose for something that is 
essential for all life and ought to be managed by and for the public.</p> 
<p>As the 1999 NRDC report notes, bottled water may be useful temporarily when 
tap water is contaminated; &quot;In the long run, however, it is far better 
from an economic, environmental and public health point of view to improve 
public drinking water supplies than it is to have a massive societal shift from 
consumer use of tap water to use of bottled water.&quot;</p> 
<p>As my 12-year-old son pointed out incredulously in the U.S. as we sampled a 
lineup of eight different brands of bottled water, &quot;Dad, they all taste 
just like water -- why pay for this stuff?&quot;</p> 
<p>Why indeed?</p>
