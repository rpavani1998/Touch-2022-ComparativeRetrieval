vinegar, baking soda and peroxide. She uses the siphon hose she is holding to 
drain bathwater into rain barrels to water her garden. (Jim Bloch/For the Daily 
Tribune)</p> 
<p>The problems facing the Great Lakes, including critical local links such as 
the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair, sometimes seem overwhelming. Where do 
you start when you're trying to deal with the eminent invasion of Asian carp, 
persistent toxins throughout the Great Lakes basin, the loss of fish and 
wildlife habitat, especially wetlands, pollution related to runoff from the 
land and the ongoing threats of massive diversions of water from the lakes to 
other states?<br>
<br>
Start literally in your own backyard and in your own 
house, says Rebecca Hammond, of Ferndale, a member of the South Eastern 
Michigan Group of Sierra Club. Hammond spoke to Blue Water Sierra Club in Port 
Huron on Sept. 28.<br>
<br>
The importance of the Great Lakes to the region, 
the country and the world can hardly be overstated. The lakes represent more 
than 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water. They provide drinking water 
for 30 million people in the basin.<br>
<br>
At 3,200 miles, Michigan has the 
longest fresh water shoreline of any state and the second longest in the 
country - Alaska is first. Michigan is home to 11,000 lakes, 56,000 ponds and 
35,000 rivers.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>&quot;We're awash in water here,&quot; said Hammonds. But water hasn't 
always been a resource that we've properly protected.<br>
<br>
There are around 
185 invasive species in the Great Lakes region, including zebra mussels, sea 
lamprey and the plants such as phragmites and purple loosestrife. Nearly half 
of those have arrived via ocean-going freighters. Recreational boaters 
sometimes play an unwitting role in spreading invasive species. If you're a 
recreational boater - a $9.4 billion per year industry in the region, providing 
60,000 jobs - there are a number of actions you can take to prevent the spread 
of invasive species.<br>
<br>
&quot;Always remove any visible mud, plants, fish 
or animals from your boat before transporting it to another body of 
water,&quot; Hammond said. &quot;Drain all water from your equipment and make 
sure you clean and dry your boat.&quot;<br>
<br>
The primary persistent toxins 
in the lakes are PCBs, DDT, dioxin and mercury. The first three are legacy 
pollutants, the use of which has been prohibited, but which don't go away. 
Mercury, however, is a key byproduct of coal-burning power plants which dot the 
local waterways. The Great Lakes basin is also inundated with polluted runoff 
from farms and cities in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, 
pharmaceuticals and potentially dangerous bacteria.<br>
<br>
Hammond 
recommended reducing or eliminating the use of pesticides and herbicides at 
home. One of the ways to do that is dig up lawns and instead cultivate native 
plants with long root systems that are naturally resilient. Hammond does not 
have a lawn at her Ferndale home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Use non-toxic cleaning 
products such as baking soda and vinegar,&quot; Hammond said. &quot;A mix of 
baking soda and peroxide will take stains out of anything - it's a miracle 
cleaner.&quot;Continued...</p>

<p>That's the cheapest way to go, she said, but plenty of green cleaners are 
now available in supermarkets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Carefully dispose of oil, paint 
and solvents,&quot; Hammond said. &quot;Don't burn your trash. And don't flush 
pharmaceuticals down the toilet. Traces of pharmaceutical drugs have been 
detected by federal health officials in 80 percent of 139 streams and rivers 
they tested in 30 states, including Michigan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wetlands provide 
habitat for fish, migratory birds and other wildlife.<br>
<br>
&quot;They also 
act as the kidneys of the Great Lakes,&quot; said Hammonds, slowing and 
cleaning the rush of water from the mainland.<br>
<br>
According to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, the total amount of wetlands in the United States 
dropped from 221 million acres in the early 1600s to 103 million acres by the 
mid-1980s. Michigan has lost between 50-85 percent. Some experts estimate that 
an acre of wetlands is lost to development every minute. Hammond advised people 
to lobby local officials to protect their wetlands and organize local 
restoration efforts.<br>
<br>
By and large, the Great Lakes Compact, ratified 
by Congress in 2008, protects the basin from large-scale water diversions. But 
it has a loophole. Water may be removed in containers smaller than 5.7 gallons. 
Who would do that on a large scale? The bottled water industry, said Hammond.
<br><br>
&quot;Don't buy bottled water,&quot; she said, also noting the huge 
waste generated in the form of plastic bottles. &quot;Drink tap water.&quot;<br>
<br>Support your municipality's efforts to separate storm and sanitary sewers 
and to build retention tanks to hold and treat stormwater during large 
rainfalls before dumping it into the river or lake.<br>
<br>
Conserve water and 
avoid dumping used water back into public sewer systems, she said. Install 
water efficient hardware and appliances in your homes and businesses. Hammonds 
drains her bathwater into rain barrels using $3 hoses and a hand pump meant to 
siphon gas. One bath equals one barrel of water. Connect your downspouts to 
rain barrels to water your property. A 1,000 square-foot roof generates 420 
gallons of water for every inch of rain - about seven barrels full. Plant trees 
and install rain gardens to slow, absorb and clean rainwater.<br>
<br>
Support 
local, state and federal efforts to clean up the Great Lakes. According to 
Michigan Sea Grant, a 10-30 percent restoration of the lakes would trigger 
$7.2-13.2 billion in long-term economic benefits for Michigan and as much as 
$31 billion for the basin.Continued...</p>

<p>&quot;Enjoy Michigan's water,&quot; Hammond said. &quot;Once you get 
connected to it, you'll want to protect it.&quot;<br>
