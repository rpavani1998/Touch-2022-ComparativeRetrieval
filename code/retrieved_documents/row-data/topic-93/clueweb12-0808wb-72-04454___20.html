<h2>Ionized Water and Weight Loss</h2> 2009-10-13 05:30:33 
<h1>Dr. Young Interview: Ionized Alkaline Water and Weight Loss</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dr. Young explains the difference between<strong> alkaline foods</strong> 
(spinach, blueberries) and<strong> acidic foods</strong> (meats, oils) and how 
consuming too much acidic food is the cause of<strong>weight gain</strong>, 
because the body needs a place to store the acid away from our vital organs. He 
talks about the importance of alkaline water, like that made by the<strong>
Genesis Water Ionizer</strong> in creating a pH balance in our bodies. </p> 
<p>This is an important video because it shows how Western medicine is finally 
beginning to understand the importance of<strong>pH balance</strong> in our 
bodies, and represents a shift from a mentality of treating symptoms with 
medicine to preventative health care, so the symptoms never show up in the 
first place.</p> 
<p>People can avoid cancer, arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and other 
adult onset diseases if they practice preventative health care techniques like 
a balance diet, drinking alkaline water, exercise, and stress management.</p> 
<p>Please watch this video to learn more. </p>

<h2>Dr. Emoto: Ionized Water and Energy</h2> 2010-05-16 05:51:48 
<h1> Ionized Water and Energy</h1> 
<p>Water has a very important message for us. Water is telling us to take a 
much deeper look at ourselves. When we do look at ourselves through the mirror 
of water, the message becomes crystal, clear. We know that human life is 
directly connected to the quality of our water, both within and all around us.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The photographs and information in this article reflect the work of Masaru 
Emoto, a creative and visionary Japanese researcher Mr. Emoto has published an 
important book, &quot;The Message from Water&quot; from the findings of his 
worldwide research</p> 
<p>If you have any doubt that your thoughts affect everything in, and around 
you, the information and photographs that are presented here, taken from the 
book of his published results, will change your mind and alter your beliefs, 
profoundly.<br>
<br>
How the molecular structure of water is affected... </p> 
<p>From Mr. Emoto's work we are provided with factual evidence, that human 
vibrational energy, thoughts, words, ideas and music, affect the molecular 
structure of water, the very same water that comprises over seventy percent of 
a mature human body and covers the same amount of our planet. Water is the very 
source of all life on this planet, the quality and integrity are vitally 
important to all forms of life.</p> 
<p>The body is very much like a sponge and is composed of trillions of 
chambers called cells that hold liquid. The quality of our life is directly 
connected to the quality of our water.</p> 
<p>Water is a very malleable substance. Its physical shape easily adapts to 
whatever environment is present. But its physical appearance is not the only 
thing that changes, the molecular shape also changes. The energy or vibrations 
of the environment will change the molecular shape of water. In this sense 
water not only has the ability to visually reflect the environment but it also 
molecularly reflects the environment.</p> 
<p>Mr. Emoto has been visually documenting these molecular changes in water by 
means of his photographic techniques. He freezes droplets of water and then 
examines them under a dark field microscope that has photographic capabilities.
</p> 
<p>His work clearly demonstrates the diversity of the molecular structure of 
water and the effect of the environment upon the structure of the water.</p> 
<p>Discover how each source has an effect on the visual photographed 
structure...<br>
<br>
 Snow has been falling on the earth for more than a few 
million years. Each snowflake, as we have been told, has a very unique shape 
and structure. By freezing water and taking a photograph of the structure, as 
Mr. Emoto has done, you get incredible information about the water. </p> 
<p>Mr. Emoto has discovered many fascinating differences in the crystalline 
structures of water from many different sources and different conditions around 
the planet. Water from pristine mountain streams and springs show the 
beautifully formed geometric designs in their crystalline patterns.</p> 
<p>Polluted and toxic water from industrial and populated areas and stagnated 
water from water pipes and storage dams show definitively distorted and 
randomly formed crystalline structures.</p>

<h2>Thoughts and Words Affect Water</h2> 
<p>After seeing water react to different environmental conditions, pollution 
and music, Mr. Emoto and colleagues decided to see how thoughts and words 
affected the formation of untreated, distilled, water crystals, using words 
typed onto paper by a word processor and taped on glass bottles overnight.</p> 
<p>The same procedure was performed using the names of deceased persons. The 
waters were then frozen and photographed.</p>

<p><strong>Energized water has had its molecules returned to their original 
life-giving, super moisturizing state</strong>. This allows maximum moisture 
absorption into the cells of your body, pets and plants; a major key to 
healing, and the maintenance of health and vitality.</p> 
<p>Dr. Emoto has revealed to the world the power of water's vibration. <strong>
Take the next step</strong> and bring this transformation into your life and 
into your part of the world by naturally structuring your water.</p> <br>
<br>

<br> 
<p> These photographs show the incredible reflections of water, as alive and 
highly responsive to every one of our emotions and thoughts.</p> 
<p>Masaru Emotos extraordinary work is an awesome display, and powerful tool, 
that can change our perceptions of ourselves and the world we live in, forever. 
We now have profound evidence that we can positively heal and transform 
ourselves and our planet by the thoughts we choose to think and the ways in 
which we put those thoughts into.</p>

<h2>Manny Wallace on Ionized Water</h2> 2009-10-13 05:30:30 
<h1>Affiliate Manny Wallace Explains Alkalinity, Antioxidants, Ionized Water
</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I was growing up in the 1960&rsquo;s, my dad would always tell jokes. 
One of his favorites was the water joke which went like this. One day, a gent 
walks into a bar and tells the bartender that he can name any drink blindfolded 
and would bet the price of the drink on that. The bartender went through 
several different drinks and the gent named each one correctly. So, the 
bartender sat up a glass of water. The gent drank the water and spat it out 
immediately. When the bartender asked the gent what it was, the gent replied, 
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but they&rsquo;ll never be able to sell it!!&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know how wrong he was. The soda pop companies have duped 
you into buying their &ldquo;bottled water.&rdquo; Dasani, from Coca-Cola, Deja 
Blue from Seven-Up, and Aquafina from Pepsi. What these companies have done is 
to take the water they have added syrup to for a long time, bottle it, and sell 
it on the market for more than the soda. There are also many local water 
companies in all areas of the country. What most people do not understand is 
that the bottle is made from petroleum. They store these bottles in warehouses 
where temperatures can reach over 140 degrees. This leaches toxins into the 
water before you ever open the bottle. I have also done ph tests on the water 
that comes from these companies, only to find it an acidic 5.5 ph. It is 
actually dehydrating you. The soda is a 2.7 ph. The body needs 7.365 ph in 
order to operate holistically. Anything less than that creates illness and 
disease that could otherwise be avoided.</p> 
<p>When I was in the military, I had the opportunity to spend two years on 
Okinawa, Japan. Recently, something dawned on me. I didn&rsquo;t see any of the 
people there in wheelchairs or walkers, and rarely saw one on a cane. There was 
no handicapped parking places there off the base.</p> 
<p> They eat a lot of fish products and drink a lot of green tea. Green tea 
has a ph of around 9.0. I worked with Okinawan civilians there that were older 
gents. I&rsquo;m not sure how old they were, but they had excellent mobility 
and didn&rsquo;t seem to ever be in much pain.</p> 
<p>When I am out in public, I have my water with me in dark blue bottles to 
preserve the freshness of the charge from my machine. This attracts people who 
have questions about where they can buy the water. We have regressed since the 
1960&rsquo;s to the common practice of buying water. I no longer drink anything 
that does not come from my machine other than some milk. I make my coffee out 
of it.</p> 
<p>I have never experienced anything that makes me feel like the water from 
the machine does. I found out that my diet wasn&rsquo;t just about what I eat, 
it is also about what I drink. If you do not currently have one of these 
machines in your home, then the water you are drinking is a joke. 
Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t funny like the joke listed above once was.</p>

<h2>Dale Rice Genesis Equus Ionized Water and Preclampsia</h2> 2010-02-28 
05:37:49 
<h1>Ionized Water and Preclampsia</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;We bought a <strong>Genesis Equus Water Ionizer</strong> from you in 
January.&nbsp; We love it!!! Our daughter-in-law is<br>
expecting a baby.&nbsp; 
She was diagnosed with pre-clampsia (sp?) on March 21 at about 30 weeks 
along.&nbsp; Her doctor told her that her kidneys and liver were in 
trouble.&nbsp; They told herto (sorry if this is a gross thing to say but it is 
important) collect her urine for 24 hours and bring it in to be tested to see 
if they needed to take her baby early. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
She stopped at her 
alternative health care lady, Cindy, to see what she had to say about the 
pre-clampsia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cindy told her she needed to drink a minimum of 80 
ounces of 9.0 pH<strong>ionized water </strong>every day. &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
Well, we rushed our Genesis up to their house and 
hooked it up and she guzzled<strong>ionized wate</strong>r from <br>
Friday 
afternoon until Sunday when she started her collection, and then kept 
guzzling.&nbsp; She<br>
took the sample in to them on Monday morning. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
She found out the results of the test on 
Wednesday, March 26, and guess what??? Her doctor<br>
said, &quot;Your kidneys 
and liver are doing great.&quot;&nbsp; She didn't tell him why, but we all know 
why --<br>
it is the water she drank from your <strong>Genesis Water Ionizer
</strong> that helped her <br>
be better.&nbsp; She is continuing to drink her 
80+ ounces daily and we're hoping and praying that<br>
she can carry this baby 
to full term with the help of the water.&nbsp; We don't dare bring home the<br>

water machine because we want her baby to go to full term. &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
So, we have decided to give them that Genesis and 
buy us another one.&quot; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
PS&nbsp; Thank you again 
so much for making it possible for us to own a KYK Harmony machine.<br>
We had 
someone try to sell us an<strong>Enagic</strong> for $4000 and we just can't 
afford that kind of<br>
money and besides your machine is superior to theirs. 
For half the cost of an Enagic we<br>
can have one for us and one to help our 
daughter-in-law.&quot;<br>

<h2>Barb Ionized Water and Diabetic Medicine Testimonial</h2> 2010-02-28 
05:42:31 
<h1>Ionized Water and Diabetic Medicine</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;I was out of my <strong>Genesis Equus ionized water</strong> for a 
few days, and I noticed a big difference! In the short time that I've been 
drinking the water, I've been able to cut back on my<strong> diabetic medicine
</strong>, and I just stopped taking a prescription that they said I would have 
to be on for the rest of my life. I don't know if it has to do with the<strong> 
ionized wate</strong>r, or the fact that I had all the dental work done. I'm 
leaning toward the water because my whole system is changing.</p> 
<p><br>
My doctor's office is hoping that this dental work will be a key 
component in resolving some of my medical issues. If so, they suggested that I 
speak about it, and it would be a great way to introduce the water.</p> 
<p><br>
Thanks so much for getting me the water on a regular basis.&quot; <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Dear Alderin, </p> 
<p><br>
Dr. Gerone is buying a <strong>Revelation Water Ionizer</strong> from 
me soon.&nbsp; She is an ENT doctor/surgeon, but has a dual practice in 
Holistic medicine.&nbsp; She has been detoxing me with<strong>ionized water
</strong> for over a month now.&nbsp; I got a QFA/BTA test a month ago and had 
a follow up test today.&nbsp; I have lost 30 pounds in 30 days without changing 
my diet.&nbsp; She has me on a number of enzymes and stuff.&nbsp; I had been 
drinking<strong> alkaline water</strong> a week before I first saw her.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> She said that alkaline water was the best therapy for <strong>
detoxification,</strong> so I bought a machine.&nbsp; (a great one at that!) My 
mother is in love with her machine and I am sure in a week or so all of her 
friends will want one.&nbsp; I am also considering placing a small ad in a 
Holistic health newspaper called Aquarius that is popular around here.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;I purchased my <strong>Genesis Water Ion</strong><strong>izer</strong>
 as a Christmas gift for my husband. I know the health benefits are there but 
the most noticeable is that the water just tastes so much better than our tap 
water or water through a &quot;Brita&quot; filter.</p> 
<p> Another amazing benefit is the effect on my house plants. I save the 
discharge<strong>acidic water</strong> and use it to water my plants. My 
cyclamen, peace lilly, and African violets are all flowering as never before -- 
they are loaded with blooms. The greenery is healthy and lush.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> I never expected this result. Anyone with house plants will be thrilled 
with the side benefit of the<strong>alkaline ionized water.</strong>&quot; </p>

<h1>Ionized Water Ministry of Health With Water Ionizers</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Greetings Alderin, <br>
&nbsp;<br>
As a Water for life USA distributor, I 
like to have personal contact with my customers so I offer them free 
installation and delivery. I have<strong>Genesis Water Ionize</strong>r 
installed from the west coast to the east coast. I know that many people are 
being helped by drinking the<strong> ionized alkaline water</strong>, but what 
tickles me the most is when their filters run out and they tell me they cannot 
drink any other water. One of the reasons being that the other waters are so 
hard to drink, and they can feel Genesis<strong> ionized water</strong> going 
into their cells and being absorbed into the body. I look at this 
distributorship as more of a &quot;ministry to health&quot; than I do to work, 
and I have many testimonies to all that this water is doing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Thank you for all your good support.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I do look forward to 
greater sales to help others.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sincerely, Tom Holmquist </p>

<h2>Jeremy, Sacramento, CA Genesis Platinum Testimonial</h2> 2010-02-28

<h1>Genesis Water Ionizer Ionized Water Better than Reverse Osmosis Water</h1> 
<h1> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>&quot;I had read about the importance of pH balancing, and even 
about a healing resort in Switzerland with natural mountain stream water with a 
pH of 9 (a little alkaline) that has healed many people of a variety of 
diseases. I measured the pH of my tap water to be a pH of 6 (slightly acidic), 
and my reverse-osmosis water to be a pH of 5.5 (more acidic!). I bought my 
Genesis water ionizer because I was concerned about health problems caused by 
drinking and cooking with this water. I set it to output with a pH of 9, and my 
wife and I use it for all drinking and cooking water.</strong></p> 
<p><strong><br>
&quot;I found that I craved this water and drank more water 
over the day than before because it tasted so good. After a few days, we both 
noticed that our feces were dark and goopy, but there was no discomfort. This 
continued for about a month, and then our feces went back to normal. Since the 
same thing happened to both of us, and the water was the only thing we changed, 
we knew it was the water that caused this cleansing effect. We were surprised 
to get this effect since we had both been taking Primal Defense probiotic for 
several years. We both feel better after having switched to the Genesis water 
ionizer.&quot;</strong></p>

lives. We are all vegetarian, practice Qigong and have healthy 
lifestyles.<br>
I only give this information for reference, to let you know 
something about our knowledge<br>
level. </p> 
<p><br>
This testimonial is strictly my own experience, using the Genesis 
Ionizer:<br>
I am sixty-seven years young, ex-British Special Forces, and I 
know the value of balance and<br>
tranquility in our lives. As we become 
mature, our bodies require more hydration, with the<br>
highest alkaline, 
purest, low acid water available to us. Even with my training of what our body
<br>requires to be tranquil and balanced, the weak link in the chain has always 
been the quality of<br>
available drinking water. </p> 
<p><br>
I live in Sidney, British Columbia, Canada. Our water from the tap is 
most likely some of the<br>
very best in the world for purity and clarity. This 
water directly from from the tap is pH 6.2 -- it<br>
is already acid.&nbsp; 
Acid bodies are sick bodies. Acid in our bodies is the cause of ALL disease in
<br>our body. There is definitely a need for acid water. It has many healing 
and sanitizing<br>
properties; we just should not have an acid body system. <br>
I know that most people will probably not believe what I say about this 
product; that will<br>
unfortunately be their loss. My life is so much more 
tranquil, knowing that I can control my<br>
acid levels in my blood. Although 
my wife and I have only used the Genesis for a short time,<br>
we are extremely 
grateful for all the health benefits it is making to our personal health. We are
<br>healthier, happier, energized, and more active than before.&nbsp; I am 
happy to take part in your<br>
testimonial. <br>
I will be happy to go (on and 
on,) into further benefits I have received from using the Genesis<br>
should 
you wish.</p> 
<p><br>
I look forward to a long, healthy and prosperous relationship with 
both you and Water for life<br>
USA.</p>

<h2>Satisfied Genesis Equus Customer</h2> 2011-07-26 04:03:28 
<h1>Happy With The Genesis Equus</h1> 
<p>Yes, my family is enjoying and reaping the benefits of the Genesis Equus 
water ionizer. Not that I was overweight, but have lost 12 lbs., look and feel 
incredibly lean! Now you can see why my friends are so interested with their 
own water system. I was using the Zero Water filter which I found out is 
acidic, just like RO, dead water. Within six months of drinking this water, I 
started to feel bloated and my ankle was sore and swollen by the end of the 
day. I couldn't understand why this was suddenly happening, well now I know 
why. Thanks to your research and water system, it truly is a &quot;reverse 
aging&quot; elixir.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, Carol</p>
