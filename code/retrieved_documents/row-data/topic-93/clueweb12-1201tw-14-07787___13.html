<h2>Water for Thought</h2>  Supplies of drinking water are dwindling 
worldwide, but in our remote island state, water security is particularly 
crucial. The Legislature is being asked to fund the governor&rsquo;s new plan 
to protect watersheds--the sources of our drinking water. If our reps turn him 
down, we face a thirsty future. by Paul &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Berry | Mar 28, 2012 
<br> <br>

<p>Cover</p> <br>

<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s waters of life, ka wai ola, are the very essence of life and 
culture in Hawaii, what we survive on and must pass along as a sustainable 
legacy. In the lyrics to &ldquo;Aloha Oe,&rdquo; Queen Liliuokalani tells of 
the rain falling onto the blossoms of native ohia trees in Hawaii&rsquo;s 
mountain forests. Wai&ndash; fresh water&ndash; has always been sacred to the 
Hawaiians, as it was to the Greeks, another island people who worshipped 
springs. In our rush to development, we&rsquo;ve imperilled this resource 
that&rsquo;s essential to all species&rsquo; survival, from our own to the 
&lsquo;iiwi bird that feeds on the nectar of &lsquo;ohia. We&rsquo;ve done so 
by failing to adequately conserve our natural watersheds, the mountain forests 
that collect and filter the water we drink.</p> 
<p>In tight budget times for Hawaii, some might challenge the timing of a 
watershed initiative that will run millions of dollars a year. The Hawaii 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) counters that our future is at 
stake. &ldquo;We need to be incorporating into our thinking Hawaii&rsquo;s 
water needs 50 years from now,&rdquo; says William Tam, deputy director of the 
Commission on Water Resource Management. Besides, some key funding for the 
watershed protection plan may come from a 10-cent surcharge on single-use bags 
at retail stores. This new revenue source is provided for in SB2511, which, 
along with SB2782 (authorizing funding for DLNR&rsquo;s watershed programs), 
has passed the Senate and is now pending in the House. Right now is the crucial 
time &ldquo;to let our legislators know that we support watershed protection 
and these bills, because each bill only has one more public hearing to 
go&ndash;before the House Finance Committee,&rdquo; says Mark Fox, director of 
external affairs for the Hawaii chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC).</p> 
<p>Why the urgency? Our fresh water supply is declining, according to the 
DLNR&rsquo;s The Rain Follows the Forest plan, which adds: &ldquo;If this trend 
continues, future generations will not have access to water at reasonable 
rates, and may face tight restrictions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Retired state forester Mike Buck puts it bluntly: &ldquo;Our watersheds are 
arriving at a tipping point with water the source on which our lives 
depend.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Here are some of the supporting facts:</p> 
<p>In December 2011, the US Geological Survey (USGS) announced that Hawaii is 
in a long-term drought, &ldquo;severe&rdquo; and even &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; in 
some parts of the state.</p> 
<p>Half of Hawaii&rsquo;s prime watershed forests are gone, and of the 840,000 
acres remaining, only 10 percent are now well-protected from serious assaults 
by invasive species, DLNR&rsquo;s plan reports.</p> 
<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s thirsty population is now more than double that at 
statehood, and set to double again in another 60 or so years.</p> 
<p>Climate change and sea level rise threaten our aquifers with saltwater 
encroachment, and there are questions about the sustainable yield in some 
aquifers.</p> 
<p>Our heavy reliance on global food sources puts us at serious risk.</p> 
<h3>Interconnectedness</h3> 
<p>You and I are roughly 60 percent water, by both volume and weight. The 
human brain is 70 percent water, so here is some water for thought.</p> 
<p>As Gov. Neil Abercrombie put it in announcing the plan, &ldquo;The best 
time to start protecting our mauka watersheds was decades ago. The second best 
time is now.&rdquo; The governor added, &ldquo;Investing in the protection of 
fresh water sources must be the highest priority for Hawaii&rsquo;s public 
leaders.&rdquo; Emphasis: &ldquo;highest priority.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Growing our own</h3> 
<p>&ldquo;We need a comprehensive planning system that incorporates protecting 
watersheds and water sources, stimulating far more local farming, smart growth 
linked to transportation and more clean energy. Water links all of 
these,&rdquo; says Sen. Donovan Dela Cruz.</p> 
<p>According to a new Ulupono Initiative survey on local food production, more 
than 90 percent of Hawaii residents see growing far more of our own food as 
either &ldquo;Extremely Important&rdquo; or &ldquo;Important.&rdquo; Similar 
surveys show voters supporting more watershed protection just as heavily. 
Without secure water sources, local diversified agriculture can&rsquo;t expand 
to provide better food security. With a bill on food self-sufficiency currently 
making its way through the House, the legislature has yet another opportunity 
to contribute to food security&ndash;by funding water security through SBs 2511 
and 2782.</p> 
<p>For 1.36 million Hawaii residents plus 150,000 daily tourists, 92 percent 
of everything we eat is imported. Aside from macadamia nuts, according to 
farmer Charles Reppun, we plant only 5,000 acres of diversified agriculture to 
produce food for local consumption. But Hawaii grows some 15,000 acres of 
genetically engineered seed corn, all for export. Other sources say we have at 
most seven days of food available should a disastrous earthquake, a tsunami or 
a shipping strike stop our regular food imports.</p> 
<p> Our 92 percent imported food (plus nearly 100 percent imported energy) 
represents a disaster waiting to happen. Heavy reliance on imported food means 
that, in effect, we also import the water it takes to grow that food, water 
from national and world sources now undergoing dramatic changes via global 
warming.</p> 
<p>Do we have the water needed to grow most of our food? Only Maui and Oahu 
presently face questions of water scarcity. Islanders use somewhere between 100 
and 200 gallons of water apiece daily, with our recent per-capita water 
consumption declining slightly. On the other hand, rising population, increases 
in visitors, climate change and sea level rise, a long-term serious drought, 
and a siege of invasive species threatening our watersheds create a kind of 
perfect storm of risks.</p> 
<h3>Bread and water</h3> 
<p>About half the calories humans consume globally come directly from grain, 
with grain-fed meat and egg products a significant part of remaining calories. 
The world adds 76 million more people a year, the equivalent of Hawaii&rsquo;s 
population every 6.5 days. With seven billion of us now scrambling after the 
same water and food resources, scientists tell us we already consume as if we 
had 1.5 worlds to draw on. Some 3.5 billion people live in 18 countries that 
are seriously overdrawing their aquifers, countries that include the US, 
Mexico, China and India. Huge new deserts are forming in Northern China and 
Africa. The race between available global water and food versus global 
population has long since set off alarms Hawaii needs to heed.</p> 
<p>Alexander Mueller, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) director 
general of natural resources, projects that by 2050 food demand and water use 
will both soar by 70 percent. Mueller is signaling us that the era of cheap 
food is ending, and that without what he calls &ldquo;more crop per 
drop,&rdquo; serious water scarcity will likely become the norm. Seventy 
percent of freshwater allocations globally already go to farmland irrigation, 
and swelling megacities compete for that water.</p> 
<p>According to water analyst Peter Gleick, testifying before Congress, 
&ldquo;Climate changes are increasingly threatening water systems and water 
resources everywhere,&rdquo; an opinion supported by more than 60 top 
international scientific organizations. Gleick goes on to cite a critical 
challenge in &ldquo;inadequate investment in critical water 
infrastructure,&rdquo; i.e., watershed protection.</p> 
<p>Amid this challenging, waterlogged scenario, Gleick reminds us that it 
takes 1,000 tons of water to grow one ton of wheat, a gallon of water to grow 
the wheat for a slice of bread, 150 gallons to produce a 1/3-pound hamburger 
and about 70 gallons to produce a glass of beer.</p> 
<p>Lester Brown in <i>World on the Edge </i>puts it succinctly, &ldquo;We are 
one bad harvest away from chaos in world food markets,&rdquo; those same 
markets which you and I expect to feed us.</p> 
<h3>Hawaii rainforests need more protection</h3> 
<p>All this global gloom obviously argues for a comprehensive effort to grow 
far more food here for local consumption, something ancient Hawaiians mastered 
with their ahupuaa system and comprehensive approach to protecting water 
resources.</p> 
<p>Gov. Abercrombie, DLNR water officials, plus 11 existing watershed 
partnerships and important contributors, such as TNC and Coordinating Group for 
Alien Pest Species (CGAPS), all advocate doubling our rainforest watershed 
protection.</p> 
<p>As US Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently reminded us, 
on a national scale, one out of 12 jobs relates to farming. Hawaii, however, 
has a meager 7,500 people employed in farming. Hawaii needs these jobs as much 
as we need locally grown food and farm income circulating in the islands.</p> 
<p>On the water delivery side, Honolulu&rsquo;s Board of Water supply just 
announced a major initiative to repair and replace aged water pipes. Honolulu 
water prices will rise 70 percent in the next five years.</p> 
<h3>The silent invasion</h3> 
<p>Currently, 11 watershed partnerships effectively protect only 10 percent of 
the priority watershed areas, about 90,000 out of 840,000 mauka acres. This 
level of partnership management has taken 40 years to develop. In<i>The Rain 
Follows</i> plan, DLNR has set a goal of doubling the area of protected 
watershed areas in just 10 years. Invasive feral pigs and goats, plus deer, 
feral cattle, and a few feral sheep ravage our watersheds. Feral pigs reproduce 
as early as age 6 months; one pig can multiply to as many as 500 in four years. 
These ungulates devastate indigenous plant species, creating puddles that 
harbor avian mosquitoes and spreading non-native strawberry guavas. A feral pig 
can devastate a forest area the size of a football field in a week.</p> 
<p>According to Christy Martin of CGAPS, 200 invasive plants pose serious 
threats to the balance of watershed forests. &ldquo;In the long run, how 
effectively we deal with these invasive species holds a key to our 
future,&rdquo; Martin says. Invaders include:</p> 
<p>Salvinia molesta, a South American water fern which can double its mat in 7 
to 10 days. Control and eradication costs, $1 million a year.</p> 
<p>Miconia calvescens, a 30-50 foot tree producing millions of 
sand-grain-sized seeds per year, eliminating other plants and keeping the water 
from reaching the rain forest floor to recharge the watershed. Cost, $3 million 
a year and growing.</p> 
<p>Coqui frogs, whose sound can reach 90 decibels, and concentration can reach 
up to 10,000 per acre. Moreover, they don&rsquo;t eat mosquitoes.</p> 
<p>Strawberry Guavas, which grow to 15 feet and now engulf 495,000 acres, 
causing serious losses of rare endemic flora and fauna, as well as consuming 
water that never reaches the rest of the ecosystem. Feral pigs spread the 
guavas.</p> 
<p>Total annual Hawaii losses to invasive species are estimated at $300 
million, not counting the loss of water in island aquifers.</p> 
<p>Inspecting cargo flights to Maui, Hawaii&rsquo;s Department of Agriculture 
found an average of one new insect species arriving per day. Grossly 
underfunded inspection and prevention measures mean higher watershed protection 
costs.</p> 
<h3>Hawaiian watershed wisdom</h3> 
<p>Sam &lsquo;Ohu Gon III, senior rainforest scientist and cultural advisor 
for TNC Hawaii, says, &ldquo;Our forests are in danger of losing the natural 
balance that supplies us our water.&rdquo; In<i>The Rain Follows</i> plan, he 
adds, &ldquo;Hawaiian traditions regard these mauka forests as sacred, and the 
plants and the animals within them as our &lsquo;aumakua&ndash;our elders and 
ancestors. Damage and loss of these forests chips away at the foundation of our 
cultural identity.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Hawaiian cultural analyst and practitioner Ramsay Taum adds an important 
perspective, &ldquo;wai, fresh water, carries within it the word for food, 
&lsquo;ai. All living things, mankind, plants, animals, are connected by the 
waters of life. Waiwai refers to wealth of any kind, to high value, and kanawai 
means the law, rules requiring respect.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Today, some 71 county, state, federal, private and non-profit entities such 
as Kamehameha Schools and TNC collaborate in partnerships to manage jointly 
owned island watersheds. Historically, a single konohiki managed land and 
resource use in each ahupua&rsquo;a, a watershed management area defined by 
geographic features from mountain tops to the sea.</p> 
<p>In the <i>Hawaii Watershed Guidance Final</i>, the Hawaii Office of 
Planning Coastal Zone Management adds: &ldquo;Traditional Hawaiian management 
adopted a holistic approach that recognized the interconnectedness of land and 
sea, the interactions among species, the rhythms of the seasons, and the 
impacts of overuse on resources.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It is these traditionally sustained interconnections, from the clouds to 
the mountaintops, through the aquifers and down the streams through our 
buildings and farms to the sea that we need to retrace and fortify along with 
our ties as neighbors sharing wai.</p> 
<h3>Watershed Management Tactics</h3> 
<p>The loss of interdependent native rainforest plants can put an entire area 
ecosystem&rsquo;s survival at risk. Beyond fencing out feral animals and 
hunters, and reducing pigs and other feral ungulates, watershed management 
experts have gone high-tech, employing helicopters with aerial paintball guns 
that can deliver herbicide to a specific plant. Moreover, as tested by TNC 
Kauai Director Trae Menard, new high-resolution cameras can provide aerial maps 
with details specifying exactly which plants require removal.</p> 
<p>As The Nature Conservancy&rsquo;s Mark Fox recounts, priorities dictate 
first steps:</p> 
<p>1. Add fencing to keep feral animals out, and reduce feral animal numbers 
significantly;</p> 
<p>2. Remove invasive weeds&ndash;miconia, strawberry guavas, etc.&ndash;and 
prevent new invasives;</p> 
<p>3. Monitor/control other threats&ndash;diseases, predators, fire;</p> 
<p>4. Restore and plant native species in priority areas;</p> 
<p>5. Establish benchmarks and monitor success;</p> 
<p>6. Educate Hawaii residents</p> 
<p>7. Promote land-use decision-making protecting watersheds</p> 
<p>8. Allocate priorities to native wet and semi-wet forest moisture zones 
according to land cover type.</p> 
<h3>What can you do to foster DLNR&rsquo;s watershed protection plan?</h3> 
<p>1. Download and read <i>The Rain Follows the Forest</i> plan. [hawaii.gov]
</p> 
<p>2. Contact your state representative and senator to advocate funding <i>
Rain Follows</i>. To track watershed funding bills and committee hearings, go 
to [capitol.hawaii.gov] and under Bill Status, type in SB2511, SB 2782, or 
HB2703 (the food self-sufficiency bill). Read the bill, then submit your 
testimony, live or by email. &ldquo;Write, email or telephone members of the 
Finance Committee telling them you support these watershed protection bills and 
encourage them to hear them,&rdquo; says TNC&rsquo;s Mark Fox. [
Capitol.hawaii.gov]; chair, Rep. Marcus R. Oshiro, [email: repmoshiro]</p> 
<p>3. Support local farmers by buying local and urging the state&rsquo;s 
Agriculture Development Corp. to increase incentives for more local farming. 
Support HB9 advocating more funding for food security and HB156 preserving 
agricultural lands.</p> 
<h3>Watershed-Saving Partnerships</h3> 
<p>These private/public, non-profit watershed partnership collaborations allow 
those who know the land best to develop the most effective remedies for the 
unique problems each watershed faces. As such, the 11 partnerships offer a 
unique model of tactical, localized land and water governance.</p> 
<p>For example, the East Molokai Watershed Partnership includes 15 different 
state, county, federal, private and non-profit partners including Kalaupapa 
Historical National Park, Kamehameha Schools, and TNC. On Oahu, the Koolau 
Mountains Watershed Partnership has 15 partners ranging from the Oahu Country 
Club and Bishop Museum to the U.S. Army, TNC and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service.</p> 
<p>Benefits of these partnerships include economies of scale in planning, 
fence building, feral animal and invasive plant removal, and efficient uses of 
resources and staff&ndash;results dedicated funding can generate. 
Hawaii&rsquo;s watershed partnerships include:</p> 
<p>1. Kauai Watershed Alliance&ndash;25,000 acres</p> 
<p>2. Waianae Mountains Watershed Partnership&ndash;undetermined</p> 
<p>3. Koolau Mountains Watershed Partnership&ndash;9,000 acres</p> 
<p>4. East Molokai Watershed Partnership&ndash;25,000 acres</p> 
<p>5. Lanai Forest and Watershed Partnership&ndash;3,100 acres, 17.5 miles of 
fence</p> 
<p>6. West Maui Mountains Watershed Partnership&ndash;21,000 acres plus new 
10,100 acres</p> 
<p>7. Leeward Haleakala Watershed Restoration Partnership&ndash;11,000 acres
</p> 
<p>8. East Maui Watershed Partnership&ndash;3,500 acres</p> 
<p>9. Kohala Watershed Partnership&ndash;6,600 acres</p> 
<p>10. Mauna Kea Watershed Alliance&ndash;512 acres</p> 
<p>11. Three Mountain Alliance Kau/South Point&ndash;12,000 acres</p> 
<p>Present funding for Hawaii&rsquo;s 11 partnerships is an inadequate $1.25 
million.</p>

<h1>This week</h1> 
<h2>Water for Thought</h2> 
<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s waters of life, ka wai ola, are the very essence of life and 
culture in Hawaii, what we survive on and must pass along as a sustainable 
legacy. In the lyrics to &ldquo;Aloha Oe,&rdquo; Queen Liliuokalani tells of 
the rain falling onto the blossoms of native ohia trees in Hawaii&rsquo;s 
mountain forests.</p> 
<h2>Food Self-Sufficiency Bill Advances</h2> 
<p>&ldquo;I am here because I eat local,&rdquo; testified 6-year-old Kiana 
Corrie, one of the youngest of 50 or so supporters of HB2703, the Hawaii food 
self-sufficiency bill, at a March 21 hearing before the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. &ldquo;And I am here because I would rather see farmlands than 
buildings,&rdquo; chimed in Kiana&rsquo;s friend, Kalae Millikan (age 7, 
and&ndash;full disclosure&ndash;this writer&rsquo;s child).</p> 
<h2>smart update</h2> 
<p>Kauai taro farmer Adam Asquith has filed a complaint in US District Court 
seeking to halt Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) from launching its 
&ldquo;smart meter&rdquo; rollout [March 21: &ldquo;Big Utility is 
Watching&rdquo;]. Asquith told The<i>Weekly</i> he is not opposed to smart 
meters and would be a voluntary participant in KIUC&rsquo;s pilot project if 
asked.</p> 
<h2>Bag Beefs</h2> 
<p>It seems the politico-minded Gabbards have mounted a quest against plastic 
bags, and they&rsquo;ve rallied a large portion of Oahu residents behind them. 
Father Mike in the state Senate and daughter Tulsi in the City Council have 
both introduced bills regarding single-use bags in their respective 
bureaucracies (Tulsi Gabbard is running for US House of Representatives against 
former-Mayor Mufi Hannemann.) Introduced by Sen.</p> 
<h2>HART FY2012</h2> 
<p>Usually the one in the hot seat, former-Interim Executive Director for 
Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) Toru Hamayasu may be finding 
some relief in turning the controls over to Daniel Grabauskas, HART&rsquo;s new 
head honcho. The March 21 meeting was business as usual when Bills 31, 32 and 
33&ndash;all relating to HART budget matters for fiscal year 
2012-2013&ndash;were given first reading.</p> 
<h2>Semi-Auto Squash?</h2> 
<p>Resolution 12-25, which proposes to transfer the powers, duties and 
functions of the Board of Water Supply (BWS) to a department of water supply 
housed under the city&rsquo;s executive branch, passed second reading at 
March&rsquo;s City Council meeting. According to recently appointed BWS 
Chairman Ernest Lau, the resolution, &ldquo;has really got the attention of the 
board and the department, and we know there are improvements to be made.</p> 
<h2>back up the truck</h2> 
<p>Whenever a new food truck sets Honolulu lunch-seekers a Twitter, it 
generally does so from a parking space (or two) on a public street. More 
permanent spaces, on private land, are scarce and cost money.</p> 
<h2>Courtesy of Curtis</h2> 
<p>[March 21: &ldquo;Energy Vampire&rdquo;] Hawaii is fortunate indeed to have 
our environment protected by the watchful eye, analytic mind and fearless 
leadership of Life of the Land&rsquo;s Henry Curtis. In one ingenuous remark, 
he not only attacks Hawaiian Electric&rsquo;s leadership as venal and corrupt, 
he also impugns the common sense, integrity and ethical balance of Mina Morita, 
John Cole and Mike Chumley by suggesting [the PUC&rsquo;s] rulings could be so 
easily swayed by being wined and dined on HECO&rsquo;s thin dime.</p> 
<h2>Tiered tyrant</h2> 
<p>On Oahu, everyone does not pay the same electric rate. HECO implemented a 
tiered rate structure last year.</p> 
<h2>Writer&rsquo;s response</h2> 
<p>Thanks Kevin. Very true, and perhaps a bit of an oversight on my part. </p> 
<h2>Pesky parking</h2> 
<p>All these people in traffic every morning and very late afternoon have 
something in common: They wouldn&rsquo;t be in traffic if they didn&rsquo;t 
have parking waiting for them at their places of employment. Why would they 
even take a bus or rail service if they have parking waiting for them everyday?
</p> 
<h2>Shunned</h2> 
<p>Why is no one laughing at the idea that Mr. Obama is supposed to pull a few 
million jobs out of his cap?</p> 
<h2>Troublesome and frivolous</h2> 
<p>[March 7: &ldquo;Tapping the Source&rdquo;] The lahui and its concerns 
about annexation are troublesome. Concerning annexation, the lahui need to 
answer clearly what exactly was to be done about the non-native population on 
the Islands back then.</p> 
<h2>Agree to disagree</h2> 
<p>[Feb. 8: &ldquo;Game Changer&rdquo;] I have always agreed and disagreed 
with former-Gov.</p> 
<h2>Take action</h2> 
<p>[March 7: &ldquo;Rebuttal rebut&rdquo;] Kyle Smith and Gerard Jervis are 
suing Mid-Pacific Country Club for its use of pesticides and the impacts they 
are having on the residential communities nearby. They have my total support in 
this suit.</p> 
<h2>Big oil not to blame</h2> 
<p>[Feb. 15: &ldquo;Big Oil, big money&rdquo;] Oh, Big Oil, Cayetano&rsquo;s 
backers!</p> 
<h2>Papayas out of the bag</h2> 
<p>[March 7: &ldquo;Stealth GMO lobbyist&rdquo;] Didn&rsquo;t I read in the 
newspaper that Japan approved importation of GMO papayas, and they&rsquo;re 
selling them there now? Also, I know I&rsquo;ve read several other news stories 
in the past about how our papayas were genetically modified because of the 
Ringspot Virus, so it&rsquo;s not like it was a big secret.</p> <br>
