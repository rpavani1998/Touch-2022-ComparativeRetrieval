<p>The most disturbing thing was when he blocked the radiation with his hand. 
That means it is alpha or beta radiation. The radiation is not caused by 
cesium, which is more of a gamma emitter.</p> 
<p>It's likely tellurium or strontium, both of which are very dangerous. It 
would have to be an insane amount of plutonium to generate that reading.</p>

<p>I was puzzled by the fact that he said it decayed away very quickly (he 
seemed to say 30 or 40 minutes). Don't most of the things coming from FUK have 
longer half-lives than that (they must, to come across from Japan). Also, 
doesn't Strontium have a half-life of 29 years (I don't know what tellurium 
has).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> arclight <br>
 August 16, 2011 at 11:47 am <br>

<p>&quot;There are 30 known isotopes of tellurium with atomic masses that 
range from 108 to 137. Naturally found tellurium consists of eight isotopes 
(listed in the table to the right); three of them are observed to be 
radioactive. 128Te has the longest known half-life, 2.2&times;1024 years, among 
all radioactive isotopes.</p> 
<p>Precautions<br>
 Tellurium and tellurium compounds should be considered to 
be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care.</p> 
<p>Acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic.</p> 
<p>Humans exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/m3 or less in air develop 
&quot;tellurium breath&quot;, which has a garlic-like odour. The garlic odour 
that is associated with human intake of tellurium compounds is caused from the 
tellurium being metabolized by the body. When the body metabolizes tellurium in 
any oxidation state, the tellurium gets converted into dimethyl telluride. 
Dimethyl telluride is volatile and produces the garlic-like smell.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. I am still not seeing why the man in Canada would find 
that it is hotter immediately after the rain, but then &quot;decays away&quot; 
within about 30 minutes, unless it is not actually &quot;decaying away,&quot; 
but simply evaporating back into the air or getting absorbed into the soil (or 
otherwise dispersing away from the spot where the rain had initially landed). 
The long-lived things from FUK presumably wouldn't suddenly decay away within 
thirty minutes of falling as rain (or am I not understanding something?) This 
makes me wonder whether at least some of what he is finding are more 
short-lived isotopes from more local sources (maybe on top of the longer-live 
FUK stuff). We in North America are probably surrounded by powers plants, etc., 
that are silently spewing stuff without our knowing it.</p>

<p>i see what your trying to get at here...if it evaporates it should leave 
most of the particles behind, however it seems to me where the water went he 
found hot spots and the ground saturation must have taken the isotopes into the 
earth/mud...maybe these beta/alpha particles are water soluable!</p> 
<p>&quot;When dissolved in water, radionuclides are colorless, odorless, and 
tasteless, and typically cannot be detected by our senses, unlike many other 
contaminants that may cause an undesirable color, odor, or taste. Natural 
radioactivity in drinking water and its effect on human health recently have 
become a major environmental concern. Recent studies have shown that activities 
of some radionuclides in the ground water of southeastern Pennsylvania are 
elevated enough to pose potential health problems.&quot;<br>

<p>Let's say he is observing Iodine 134 with a half life of 53 minutes. Once 
the rain deposits the isotopes, their readings should decrease by half every 53 
minutes. There are two possibilities if this is from Fukushima. One is that 
enormous amounts of this isotope were released so that, even though a large 
amount of half life cycles took place, there was still a significant amount 
remaining by the time it reached Canada. Two, these are daughter isotopes of a 
parent isotope with a longer half life. Anyway, one thing is for sure, we are 
running the most significant experiment ever of the consequences of radioactive 
fallout.</p> </li>

<p>HOw about Radon? I read it decays quickly and is present in the rain. 
Geiger readings can go as high as 1 to 2microSievert/hour from what I heard or 
read. Wouldn't it explain these readings? Or maybe it is really unusual and a 
consequence of other radioisotope fallouts. I would like to know too.</p> </li>

<p>You can download the latest isotope readings from Takasaki here:</p> 
<p>http://www.cpdnp.jp/pdf/110816Takasaki_report_Aug12.pdf</p> 
<p>Look at the right side of the table, Te-129 and Te-129m. These are isotopes 
of tellurium, and Fuku has been emitting these isotopes from the beginning, and 
still is.</p> 
<p>By the way, look at the entry in the pdf for 3/16-3/17. The isotope ratios 
for that day demonstrate that a nuclear explosion occurred, especially the 
large amount of Tc-99m.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> arclight <br>
 August 16, 2011 at 12:08 pm <br>

<p>The resulting technetium-99 then decays to stable ruthenium-99 with a 
half-life of 211,000 years. It emits soft beta particles (electrons) in this 
process, but no gamma rays (photons). All of these characteristics ensure that 
the technetium-99 produced from technetium-99m produces very little extra 
radiation burden on the body. (arc: does that include ingestion?)</p> 
<p>Due to its short half-life, technetium-99m for nuclear medicine purposes is 
usually extracted from technetium-99m generators which contain molybdenum-99 
(Mo-99, half-life 2.75 days), which is the usual parent nuclide for this 
isotope. The majority of Mo-99 produced for Tc-99m medical use comes from 
fission of HEU (highly enriched uranium) from only five reactors around the 
world: NRU, Canada; BR2, Belgium; SAFARI-1, South Africa; HFR (Petten), the 
Netherlands; and the OSIRIS reactor in Saclay, France.[1][2] Production from 
LEU (low-enriched uranium) is possible, and is produced at the new OPAL 
reactor, Australia, as well as other sites. Activation of Mo-98 is another, 
currently smaller, route of production.[3]</p> 
<p>Demand for medical use of Mo-99 to make Tc-99m began to overtake a 
dwindling supply, in the late 2000s.<br>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium-99m</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Bobby1 <br>
 August 16, 2011 at 12:23 pm <br>

<p>&quot;Molybdenum-99 is produced commercially by intense neutron-bombardment 
of a highly purified uranium-235 target, followed rapidly by extraction.[3] It 
is used as a parent radioisotope in technetium-99m generators to produce the 
even shorter-lived daughter isotope technetium-99m, which is used in many 
medical procedures.&quot;</p> 
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_molybdenum</p> 
<p>Intense neutron bombardment of U-235 results from a nuclear detonation.</p>

<p>@bobby1<br>
 interesting! but they must be able to create it within the 
normal processes of the reactor, as they use the daughter product for medical 
use? or are you trying to say that this was from reactor three criticality 
explosion? or some other detonation?<br>

<p>Bobby1, interesting table. I think you can see quite clearly the bigger 
cesium releases every once a week (those must be the massive ventings we saw on 
the cam), becoming more rare and with lower readings over time.</p> </li> </ul>

<p>As the nuclear industry says, No one has died directly from the known 99 
plus major nuclear accidents in history.</p>

<p>And that does not even include the 2053 nuclear explosions from testing 
since 1945</p> 
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY</p>

<p>&quot;the accumulation of the lack of altitude&quot;</p> 
<p>hehe you have to love some of the things people do with the English 
language. Technically you would eventually accumulate the same 'lack of 
altitude' even with the parachute deployed, so we should factor time into the 
equation... how about 'the rapid accumulation of the lack of altitude'.</p> 
<p>Another good one in common use in aviation describes the oblivious state of 
flight crew just prior to an avoidable crash... 'fat, dumb and happy'. 
Extending the mataphor it seems most of the passengers on board our flight fit 
this description also.</p>

<p>Nobody dies 'directly' from a nuclear explosion unless they are onsite. The 
fellow who died in the Fukushima builing, and was found months later, is the 
only 'direct' casualty from this horror.<br>
 The consequent illnesses from 
nuclear exposure take years to show, although I do not think I will have to 
wait that long. But these monsters will blame it on something other than

 This news is not covered by

<p>While husband was in Fukushima,he got a phone call to tell his wife died 
suddenly.</p> 
<p>She was still only 32 years old.</p> 
<p>This is not covered by any media either,so now we are trying to figure out

<p>Cesium 134 and 137 may cause acute cardiac infarct.</p> 
<p>Strontium 90 may cause leukemia.</p> 
<p>Last week,ex professional soccer player Matsuda died of cardiac infarct too.
</p> 
<p>He was still 34 years old.</p> 
<p>He fell off during the training game. He was sent to the hospital but he 
was already cardio-respiratory arrest.His last word was &ldquo;wait..&rdquo; 
The temperature was 24.5C.</p> 
<p>Today,I received two other news too.<br>
 One was that a 4 years old cat 
died of acute leukemia in Tokyo.<br>
 The other one was that a dog died of 
acute thyroid disorder.</p> 
<p>I dare not to assert it has something to do with radiation,but something 
might have begun.</p>

<p>If anyone in Japan is reading this site, here is something that is needed:
<br> More reports of people with radiation sickness.<br>
 Reporting of this, I 
think, really discredits the nuclear industry, the governments, the major news 
media. Actual video footage of people's symptoms, for the sake of the cause of 
warning the world about nuclear plants, is as devastating to the liars as it 
gets.</p>

<p>I live 30 miles from the 4 reactor nuke plant Cattenom in France (which is 
situated right at the german border, so the westerly winds will carry the 
nasties over to us).<br>
 When it went into service in 1988, concerned citizens 
founded a club and set up measuring devices to take their own readings 24/7 
ever since. The instruments are set up on private properties near the plant. 
The club was able several times over the years to prove evidence of radioactive 
releases the French had &quot;forgotten&quot; to mention.<br>
 These are the 
sheets of the readings the club shows on its website:<br>

<p>Hi milk and cheese, I'm totally healthy (as far as I know, that is). But 
I'm a vegetarian since age 13 (I'm 36 now) and never started smoking. I've been 
living in this area for 8 years now, and honestly I'm hesitating to look out 
for an apartment to buy because of that evil nuke around the corner. So 
physically I'm fit, though the knowledge of what might happen in the middle of 
the night if.... is quite a burden mentally. Some french folks I know from work 
are TOTALLY clueless and are being intentionally misinformed by the nuke comp. 
in monthly newsletters.<br>

<p>HEADS UP!!! Excessive levels of radioactive cesium found 100 km from plant 
/ 186.000 bq/kg:</p> 
<p>&quot;Excessive levels of radioactive cesium were found in sludge in a 
ditch at a district court branch in Fukushima Prefecture, about 100 kilometers 
west of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the court said 
Tuesday.<br>
 The isotope in the sludge, sampled from a ditch at the Fukushima 
District Court's Aizuwakamatsu branch, measured about 186,000 becquerels per 
kilogram, the court said, adding it plans to remove the sludge after consulting 
with local governments.<br>
 Under government standards, sludge can be used in 
a landfill as long as the radioactive cesium contained in it measures 8,000 
becquerels per kilogram or lower.&quot;</p>

<p>Radioactive sludge piling up</p> 
<p>&quot;Contaminated sludge from sewage facilities now totals more than 
54,400 tons. 75 percent of it contains less than 8,000 becquerels per kilogram 
of radioactive cesium, the government-set limit for disposal by burial.</p> 
<p>Despite this, some 27,700 tons of sludge --- 51 percent of the total --- 
remains in storage at water treatment plants.<br>
 Local governments say some 
burial projects have been rejected by residents near proposed sites.<br>
 In 
addition, 7 storage facilities in 4 prefectures have had to set up &quot;no 
entry zones&quot; where radiation levels have gotten too high.&quot;<br>

<p>&ldquo;the &quot;Alert Level&quot; for the National Radiation Map is 100

indicated by an Alert symbol over those stations, it probably means that some

<p>I was not that surprised. See http://justiceinorout.blogspot.com/<br>
 I 
was glued to the hotspot web fire mapper with the hotspots surging suddenly- 
they were due to the hydrogenerators in synchronism surging the water levels in 
the dams in keeping with the electricity demand peaking.<br>
 Just see 
http://predictingquakes.blogspot.com/<br>
 for my update for March 11 2011<br>
 
and how I e mailed genpatsu shinsai genpatsu shinsai - after Kashiwasaki Kariwa 
I was warning the world about the coming catastrophe because of the damned 
surges cumulative effects of meeting water needs with dams.<br>
 The dam forces 
are comparable to the tectonic forces! It was the geologic time scale events 
happening instantaneously every sec of every year! But it happens to be my 
reading of the real time data which the effect of the sun etc cannot explain- 
frequent mAN made natural disaster by the cumulative effects of modern 
civilisation's consumptive greedy profiteering life style. Its so new and so 
against vested interest science that none of the msm sci jourals would 
accept... its like the specialist self interested circle that is 
neglecting/disregarding the interpretation of the data on the ground in favour 
of a decrepit theory put forward by ICRP and IAEA to keep up the nuke industry! 
See the witchcraft theory of the vested interest science groupist cult 
narration in ECRR 2003 pp 13 ff authored by Chris Busby et al. The fault dear 
friends lies not in our stars and planets but in the cumulative effects of 
modern civilisation's dams,nukesfed by demands! A whole new ball game! Thank

<p>Dear Ram: The first article above is brilliant in one primary respect to my 
eyes in that it is quite true that &quot;specialization&quot; is an ultimate 
cast system, along with the destruction of high-context cultural norms, such as 
extended family and village or community mindedness. You are definitely on to a 
core point of view for the revolutionaries out here. It is important that 
people have the courage to be GENERALISTS, while also cultivating whatever 
specialized skills they may have. We all MUST now be generalists to the best of 
our abilities. Revolutionaries are a) less prone to brainwashing, b) are able 
to empower others, c) maintain an alter-ego or OUTSIDER mindset in all 
circumstances, at all times and with all individuals. This outsider (comparison 
of differences is the mother of all understanding) perspective can be 
cultivated to the destruction of mass brainwashing, conditioning 
(institutional, cultural or despotically intentional or not) by working hard to 
understand EVERYTHING...be a generalist!!! This is a long abandoned, but to our 
peril, backbone of revolution against the greedy. We CAN do it.</p> </li> </ul>

<p>@taco see your point!<br>
 &ldquo;Polonium, when absorbed orally, tends to 
distribute widely through the tissues of the body, approximating whole body 
radiation exposure. Polonium is excreted fairly quickly, its effective 
half-life in the body is about 30 days (mostly due to excretion, but also due 
to radioactive decay). This results in a maximum total exposure equal to about 
43 times the first day exposure. Most of this is accumulated in the first 30 
days, but significant amounts occur of the next several weeks following.</p> 
<p>Because of its short half-life and rapid decay, a small quantity of 
polonium-210 is intensely active. Its &quot;specific activity&quot; is 4490 
curies/g (166 TBq/g). Thus 4 millicuries (a minimal lethal dose for 80 kg 
person) is 0.89 micrograms, an almost invisible speck of matter.</p> 
<p>In the case of absorbing a minimal lethal dose no initial illness would 
result. The decay of the polonium would deliver an accumulating exposure of 16 
cGy a day initially. No visible effect would be expected for about a week, with 
mild symptoms developing over the next week. Serious illness would not be 
expected for a month or more. This delay is partly due to the time is takes to 
accumulate dangerous internal exposures, and partly due to the time delay of 
1-2 weeks after dangerous exposure before serious illness becomes evident. The 
exposure rises eventually to 700 cGy after a few months. The actual toxic 
effect of this exposure would be lower than what the table below indicates, 
because radiation received over a period of time is somewhat less harmful than 
a dose received all at once. Nonetheless death would be expected from the 
poisoning within two or three months.</p> 
<p>This scenario contrasts strikingly with the reported symptoms of 
Litvinenko, who fell ill the day he was poisoned, was seriously ill on day 11 
later, in critical condition on day 20, and was dead on day 23. The fact that 
he became ill so quickly indicates he was poisoned with many times the lethal 
dose of Po-210.</p> 
<p>In the hour or two that elapses during gastrointestinal uptake of the 
poison, the GI system (which is about 3% of body mass) receives 
disproportionate radiation exposure, amounting to perhaps a few days worth of 
whole body exposure. If Litvinenko were poisoned with, say, 40 millicuries (ten 
lethal doses) then severe exposure on the order of 400 cGy would occur to the 
GI system. Even polonium that was not absorbed, but passed through the GI tract 
and was excreted would expose the radiation-sensitive GI lining. This would 
account for his falling ill apparently within hours of exposure. If poisoned 
with such a large amount, he would receive whole-body daily exposures of 160 
cGy. The resulting gastrointestinal syndrome, which is due to the destruction 
of the GI lining with exposures of about 700 cGy, would account for the severe 
illness that led to his death in scarcely more than three weeks. By the time of 
his death his total exposure might have reached a few thousand cGy, levels that 
would injur his cardiovascular system directly and might be related to 
Litvinenko's heart attack shortly before his death.&rdquo;<br>

<br> Japan's network of 1,200 GPS monitoring stations, operated by the 
Geographical Survey Institute, shows a maximum springing-out effect of 13 feet 
(4 meters), with an average displacement of about 8 feet (2.5 meters) along a 
stretch measuring more than 300 miles (500 kilometers).</p> </li>

<p>Japan&rsquo;s Earthquake Shifted Balance of the Planet<br>

http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/8470/</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The quake caused a rift 15 miles below the sea floor that stretched 
186 miles long and 93 miles wide, according to the AP. The areas closest to the 
epicenter of the quake jumped a full 13 feet closer to the United States, 
geophysicist Ross Stein at the United States Geological Survey told The New 
York Times.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The 9.0 magnitude quake (the fourth-largest recorded since 1900) was 
caused when the Pacific tectonic plate dove under the North American plate, 
which shifted Eastern Japan towards North America by about 13 feet. The quake 
also shifted the earth's axis by 6.5 inches, shortened the day by 1.6 
microseconds, and sank Japan downward by about two feet. As Japan's eastern 
coastline sunk, the tsunami's waves rolled in.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Why did the quake shorten the day? The earth's mass shifted towards 
the center, spurring the planet to spin a bit faster. Last year's massive 8.8 
magnitude earthquake in Chile also shortened the day, but by an even smaller 
fraction of a second. The 2004 Sumatra quake knocked a whopping 6.8 
micro-seconds off the day.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;After the country's 1995 earthquake, Japan placed high-tech sensors 
around the country to observe even the slightest movements, which is why 
scientists are able to calculate the quake's impact down to the inch. 
&quot;This is overwhelmingly the best-recorded great earthquake ever,&quot; 
Lucy Jones, chief scientist for the Multi-Hazards project at the U.S. 
Geological Survey, told The Los Angeles Times.&rdquo;</p> </li>

<p>(Reuters) - JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corp, Japan's top refiner, said on 
Saturday the fire at Sendai refinery appears to have originated from a land oil 
product shipping facility, not from an LPG tank as earlier thought, following a 
strong quake that hit northeastern Japan on Friday.<br>
 Currently, workers at 
the plant are being evacuated from the refinery, and there was no work under 
way to extinguish the fire, a company spokesman said.<br>

<p>While the thread does get off topic it does remain informative. Thanks to 
all posters for informative and entertaining read!</p> 
<p>Back to original article. High levels of radiation in the Toronto area does 
not mean it came from fukushima. Pickering and Darlington are two reactors 
within an hours drive of Toronto. Pickering is effectively a suburb of T.O. 
Thats just on the Canadian side of the lake. Off the top of my head I think the 
great lakes has twenty or so nuclear power plants on its shores.</p> 
<p>Pickering has been dumping radio-active water in Lake Ontario for years. I 
read about it thirty years ago. Its an old facility. I toured it as a field 
trip in grade school forty odd years ago. The whole area from Pickering to 
Hamilton is the second biggest industrial area in North America. Contains the 
busiest highway in North America (401). People think Canada is some sort of 
untouched wilderness. Not so in Southern Ontario.<br>
 My guess is that high 
readings in video are a combination of Fuki and local sources.</p> 
<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Yes, the guy with the Geiger counter did not use a control. There was a 
'small' leak of radioactive water into the lake the day after Fukushima. It did 
not make the headline news.<br>
 Most of the Canadian reactors are in Ontario 
for some reason.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Mark <br>
 August 16, 2011 at 6:34 pm <br>

<p>They routinely dispose of low level radio-active water into lake. Been 
doing that for decades. Is not new news. But I don't think that would cause 
radio-active rain water. I wouldn't eat a fish from Lake Ontario.... Reactors 
in Ontario because it is highly industrialized. The market is in Ontario.</p> 
<p>The collusion between governments and nuclear goes way back. You think if 
Pickering makes a radio-active fart Toronto will be evacuated? Or even told? 
Goes for eastern parts of USA that report high radiation. Maybe from Fukushima 
but lots of old reactors operating and they don't want to disrupt their 
precious economy. If a few more people die of cancer well fine. Can't be proven 
caused by nuclear industry, right?</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>We know things have actually worsened in the past 9 weeks...</p> 
<p>SP</p> 
<p>Bump from:</p> 
<p>June 3, 2011 at 2:40 am &middot;</p> 
<p>The Northern Hemisphere jet stream is rushing toxic deadly particles to 
Hawaii, Canada, the continental Americas, and re-circling constantly the entire 
globe. Rainwater and cow milk in Hawaii is contaminated. US agencies says that 
is OK because the radiation particles in rainwater are diluted in public water 
supplies. Hello! About 18,000 households with 50,000 people in Hawaii rely on 
rainwater as their sole source of drinking water.</p> 
<p>The EPA has also stopped monitoring for radiation. Today marks the one 
month anniversary of their stop loss program. Does anyone smell government 
coverup? My advice&hellip;use an umbrella in the rain. Stay inside (a lot for 
now) and replace air filters. Don&rsquo;t rely on mass media to help you stay 
informed. The reactors for Units 1, 2, and 6 were supplied by General Electric, 
those for Units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and Unit 4 by Hitachi. All six reactors 
were designed by General Electric. As mentioned by many General Electric 
media-related holdings include television networks NBC and Telemundo, Universal 
Pictures, Focus Features, 26 television stations in the United States and cable 
networks MSNBC, Bravo and the Sci Fi Channel.</p> 
<p>GE also owns 80 percent of NBC Universal. GE boasts they made umpteen 
billion dollars last year, but paid zero dollars in American taxes. I want to 
hire their tax guys. Suffice it to say, I don&rsquo;t think you can keep your 
job at GE if you say discouraging words about nuclear energy. Ditto for the 
thousands of scientists who rely on government grants to stay afloat.</p> 
<p>Digressing a bit&hellip;the strange car crash death of Oklahoma nuclear 
industry worker Karen Silkwood in 1974 (great 1983 movie with Meryl Streep) led 
to the industry losing the wrongful death $10 million civil lawsuit at the 
Supreme Court level and paying out over $1 million to her family before a 
retrial.</p> 
<p>So what do I think is going to happen in the coming weeks? </p> 
<p>You will know it is really bad in Japan when America evacuates the US 
troops stationed in southern Japan. If the radioactive releases are not stopped 
by late September I think we will see the US troops re-deployed. If it does 
worsen to that point&hellip; there won&rsquo;t be a lot of positive spin the 
governments of Japan and America can muster for the new evacuation measures.</p>
<p>Slowly and inexorably the tragic events of March 11, 2011 (aka 311) and the 
aftermath may become the top story of the 21st century&hellip;or perhaps of the 
entire era of humankind. The mass media will be drawn back into the story by 
forces beyond their control.</p> 
<p>SP</p>

 August 17, 2011 at 4:08 am <br>

<p>Great post, Sickputer, except that I do not believe that mass media will 
report on it at all. The majority of people will literally never know what hit 
them. Perhaps that is the best way after all.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>I did some math on the level of radiation. 20,000 CPM = 200&mu;Sv </p> 
<p>That is 200 &mu;Sv per min. The particle decays to 0 radioactivity after 
about 40 min (according to the person who took the video). That is around 1525 
&mu;Sv from the particle during its life, which is equal to a spinal x-ray.</p> 
<p>Now you have to take into account it looks like the particle is an alpha 
emitter.</p> 
<p>ALPHA PARTICLE RADIATION (Wikipedia)<br>
 When alpha particle emitting 
isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or 
decay rate would suggest, due to the high relative biological effectiveness of 
alpha radiation to cause biological damage, after alpha-emitting radioisotopes 
enter living cells. Ingested alpha emitter radioisotopes (such as transuranics 
or actinides) are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some 
experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous, than an equivalent activity of 
beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes.</p> 
<p>So on the avaerage that 1525&mu;Sv will cause about 20X the damage as 
normal radiation (30,480&mu;Sv), which according to the chart is equal to 
smoking a pack a day for a year.</p> 
<p>What if it was as high as 1000X as dangerous? That would be (1,525,000 
&mu;Sv), close to severe radiation poisoning.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Mark <br>
 August 18, 2011 at 3:14 am <br>

<p>If the radiation decays so fast what is it? Iodine has half life of 8 days? 
I guess there are others I am not aware of. But if that is true I guess we are 
looking at a local source not Fuki. I think after Fuki ordinary people started 
to measure radiation and when they find high levels they blame it on Fuki but 
could be a local source.<br>
 Haven't lived in Ontario for over ten years 
didn't know about 9 mile point. Where on lake is it?</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>Ontario wind power bringing down property values<br>
 CBC &ndash; Mon, 3 
Oct, 2011<br>
 RELATED CONTENT</p> 
<p>A proposed wind farm in Saint-Cyprien-de-Napierville is angering some 
residents.</p> 
<p>The Canadian Press - Sun, 25 Sep, 2011<br>
 Ontario's rapid expansion in 
wind power projects has provoked a backlash from rural residents living near 
industrial wind turbines who say their property values are plummeting and they 
are unable to sell their homes, a CBC News investigation has found.<br>
 The 
government and the wind energy industry have long maintained turbines have no 
adverse effects on property values, health or the environment.<br>
 The CBC has 
documented scores of families who've discovered their property values are not 
only going downward, but also some who are unable to sell and have even 
abandoned their homes because of concerns nearby turbines are affecting their 
health.</p>
