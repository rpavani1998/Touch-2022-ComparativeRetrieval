<blockquote> Holistic Pediatric Massage Therapy <br>
There is an increasing 
interest in finding safe and effective methods for healing many of the 
disabling psychological and physical conditions effecting children today. 
People are taking interest in Holistic Pediatric Massage Therapy and it is 
becoming a popular choice for many parents and caregivers. </blockquote> 
<blockquote> Water:How important is it for infants? </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<dl> Massage Therapy for Infants 
<p>Dr. Tiffany Field at the Touch Research Institute, University of Miami, 
Department of Medicine pioneered research in massage therapy for infants, 
children and adolescents. She discovered that neonates receiving regular 
massage gained<b>47% more weight</b> than those receiving no massage. (Both 
groups were fed the same amount of formula.) Also, the ones receiving massage 
were discharged from the hospital an average of six days earlier. Remarkable 
results were also found with normal infants. Massaged infants showed less 
stress, were more alert, were easier to soothe and had better sleep patterns. 
Stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine significantly 
decreased. Serotonin (a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, sleep and 
appetite) significantly increased with massage therapy. (Low levels of 
serotonin are associated with many disorders including depression, anxiety, 
bipolar disorder and sudden infant death syndrome. Cortisol, epinephrine, 
norepinephrine and serotonin are often targeted in drug therapy.)</p> 
<p>Statistics for children and adolescents were equally compelling. Symptoms 
of ADD and ADHD (a frequently diagnosed disorder in school-age children) 
significantly diminished. After receiving a 15 minute massage for 10 
consecutive school days, the percentage of time on task increased from 43% to 
77%. Scores on the Conner&#146;s Scale (a frequently used assessment for 
diagnosis) decreased from 28.0 to 11.3. Dr. Field remarked, 
&#147;&#133;adolescents were less depressed and less anxious than they had been 
and their stress hormones (cortisol and norepinephrine) had decreased. They 
also developed better organized sleep patterns and showed more appropriate 
behavior after massage therapy. Long term effects reported by teachers included 
more time on task and lower Conners Hyperactivity scores.</p> 
<p>In another study, computation time and accuracy were positively effected by 
therapeutic massage. After only one 15 minute massage, student&#146;s accuracy 
increased from an average of 69% to 89% and time of completion decreased from 
250 seconds to 234 seconds. Cortisol and state anxiety levels significantly 
dropped. Depressed children showed short-term and long-term gains from massage 
therapy. They were observed as more cooperative, less depressed and less 
anxious. In addition, sleep patterns significantly improved; time asleep 
increased from 79.7% to 91.3%. Children with PTSD showed a significant 
reduction in depression; from 28 to 16 on the CESD Depression scale.&nbsp;<br>

Therapeutic massage also works for immune disorders. Children with cancer 
showed significant improvement on all blood count measures including white and 
red blood count, platelet count and hemoglobin level. Also, they were found to 
be significantly less tactile defensive and less depressed. Many other 
conditions were positively effected my massage therapy including juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, asthma, migraine headaches, dermatitis, 
bulimia, anorexia, and more.</p> 
<p><b>Practice</b> </p> 
<p>&nbsp; Therapeutic massage for infants, children and adolescents differs 
from adult therapy in many ways: Infant massage is usually taught to 
parents/guardians and is easy to learn. Massage offers a natural way to connect 
and bond. Infant massage is taught as an art that comes from the heart and is 
simply administered with hands. The most important lesson is how to connect, be 
aware and present through all states (crying, quiet alert, active alert, drowsy 
and sleeping) and stages of growth.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With children and adolescents, direct instruction may be given to the 
parent or guardian; however, the older the child, the more common it is to have 
the therapist perform the massage. The parent/guardian is present at all times 
and serves a vital role. Through observation and/or participation they learn 
new ways to connect, communicate and assist their child in the future. Children 
should always feel empowered telling them that they are in charge. Parents, 
guardians and therapist are in control; their role is to guide and assure that 
the child feels safe and comfortable at all times.&nbsp; The founding principle 
of HPMT is: feeling comfort, peace and ease eliminates dis-ease; quieting the 
mind to a state of stillness heals illness. Perhaps the greatest benefit of 
HPMT is that it presents a unique opportunity for children, parents and 
guardians to feel empowered and confident while learning about safe and 
nurturing touch.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A variety of techniques may be used for children and adolescents. 
Reflexology is often a good starting point for many. Pressing and rubbing areas 
on the feet and hands elicits a healing response which reflexes to specific 
areas of the body. This technique may feel safer for shy clients. It can also 
be a useful method of assessment. Emotions such as fear, anxiety and anger are 
reflected throughout the body as tight muscles and are sometimes stored there 
as knots. NMT &#150; neuromuscular technique employs light, sustained pressure 
with thumb or finger which reduces built-up knots and relieves the symptoms of 
stress. Compression resets spindle fibers and effects pressure receptors which 
has a positive neurological effect. It is administered with a flat hand or fist 
and is applied with medium pressure in a rhythmical way. Kneading relaxes 
muscles and takes pressure off nerves. It involves lifting, grasping and 
releasing muscles. Percussion is stimulating at first; however, over time it 
can have a soothing effect. Using brief, rapid, rhythmic strokes increases 
circulation and tones the muscles.</p> 
<p>At the end of the session, children often report feeling a sense of peace 
and ease. For some this is a first! They usually feel safer, more grounded and 
more in touch with themselves and their environment. Parents also report 
experiencing these same feelings. As the child heals, the family heals.<br>

Other holistic techniques other than massage therapy may be included to enhance 
each session or they may be used exclusively. Clients can be taught many of 
these techniques to use between sessions to bring back feelings of peace when 
needed. Some of these techniques may include: Reiki is a simple, yet powerful 
form of healing which means Universal Life Energy. During a session the Reiki 
practitioner simply sends healing energy by putting his/her hands on or 
slightly above the client&#146;s body. Reiki is easy to learn especially for 
children who have an innate sense of healing energy. Reiki may be administered 
to ones self or others. Polarity Therapy is a more precise form of energy 
healing that balances and revitalizes ones energy field. It was developed by 
Dr. Randolph Stone, a chiropractor who combined the wisdom of acupressure, 
chiropractic, Ayurvedic and Chinese systems of healing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The practitioner uses light pressure on meridian points to open and clear 
energy pathways, gently massages shoulders and feet, and clears chakras and 
auras through Intention using crystals. EFT- Emotional Freedom Technique 
combines techniques used in hypnotherapy and acupressure. It works with the 
body&#146;s bioenergy systems. While reciting positive affirmations, the client 
is taught to tap certain meridian points which alleviates, and sometimes 
eliminates, emotional distress. Aromatherapy uses essential oils to improve 
client&#146;s psychological and physical well-being. The essence of these 
healing oils easily penetrates the olfactory membranes in the nose sending 
nerve impulses to the brain which ultimately affects the amygdala, the memory 
center for fear and trauma. Music is typically played during sessions. It is 
soothing and healing during therapy and can played between sessions which 
elicit the same effect. Yoga helps align the body, focus the mind and renew the 
spirit. Sometimes children like to get into child&#146;s pose or other poses 
while receiving massage therapy to enhance its effect. Creative visualization 
creates healthy thoughts and in turn, healthy emotions. Creative visualization 
along with breathing and centering exercises is fundamental for teaching a 
child how to take &#147;Time-In.&#148; This helps them alleviate the need for a 
&#147;time out.&#148; Time In empowers; time out alienates.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Choosing a Practitioner</b> </p> 
<p>The first thing to look for in a Holistic Pediatric Massage Therapist is 
completion of a reputable program and license to practice in the state where 
service is provided. Of equal importance, though, is specialized training along 
with extensive and successful experience working with children. The ability to 
communicate with children is key. In this respect, someone with a background in 
childcare, education, special education and/or crisis intervention is ideal. 
The qualifying opinion that matters most, though, is your child&#146;s. For 
this reason, an initial consultation that is child-centered and child-directed 
is critical. Children have an innate sense about who and what feels right and 
may help them. The interview process is usually brief. More often than not, 
children will ask to preview a session by &#147;sampling&#148; various 
techniques. The child has final approval on whether or not to book a future 
session.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Water: </b> How important is it for infants? 
<p>For some readers the very idea of giving water to their nursing babies may 
be choking. Learn why some experts urge that breasted or bottle fed infants 
drink water in in our chemically polluted environment</p> 
<p>Often, when there are controversial subjects, wherein so called experts 
disagree, I will give information about opposing points of view. In this way I 
feel that you can then make your own decision and choices.<i>Shirley</i> </p> 
<p>Do babies need water to drink? A 1997 study at the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention in Atlanta found that about 25 percent of new mothers 
gave their babies water at least three times per week in the first month of 
life. The researchers felt this was a significant problem.As Toronto lactation 
consultant Anne Kirkham explains, &quot;Giving water to young babies can make 
some undesirable things happen and can suppress other good things.&quot; For 
example, in the first days after birth, drinking water has been found to 
increase the severity of newborn jaundice. &quot;Babies who are breastfeeding 
well don't have much problem with jaundice,&quot; says Kirkham, &quot;but those 
who are given water as well will become more jaundiced, and this makes them 
sleepy and lethargic.&quot; Giving water in the early weeks can also interfere 
with breastfeeding. The infant who has a tummy full of water will drink less 
milk at his feedings, and his mother's breasts will decrease milk production in 
response. The result: The baby gets less milk, and may not grow as well. One 
study in Australia found that newborns who were given water with sugar after 
each feeding at the breast lost more weight than babies who were breastfed 
exclusively. In addition, if the water is given in a bottle, the baby's sucking 
technique may become confused.&quot;Teresa Pitman </p> 
<p>&quot;In India and in some other countries, mothers of new born babies are 
being given the dangerous advice that the baby must not be given any water for 
the first 6 months.&nbsp; This can result in irreparable damage to the baby's 
kidneys.&quot;Sai Sanjeevini Foundation </p>

<p>Breast milk has many benefits for babies that are superior to formula. 
Babies who are breastfed are reportedly less likely to get sick (with diarrhea, 
gastrointestinal illness, urinary-tract infections, respiratory disease, 
pneumonia or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), less likely to have 
allergies, less likely to have later weight problems, less likely to have ear 
infections, and -- according to a study published in theMay 8, 2002, issue of 
the Journal of the American Medical Association -- likely to be more

<p>When my son, Sterling, was born in 1979, I was a member of the LLL and was 
taught that babies did not need water or anything else, other than mother's 
milk. So, I exclusively breadfed my son for 3 years (he is brain-injured) and I 
never gave him a drop of water. I'm from Belgium, I was bottle-fed and never 
got a drop of water while on fomulas. My husband on the other hand, born to 
African-American/Native American parents in Arkansas (homebirth) was breastfed 
and he remembers that it was common practice togive water with a spoon or a cup 
to breastfed infants..When I read &quot;Water- a must for new born 
babies&quot;, I thought that this was important information to share with 
others and decided to publish it on my site. Had I known about this information 
20 years ago, I would have certainly given water to my son. Occasionally I 
receive emails from breastfeeding mothers or members of LLL who strongly 
disagree with giving water to infants. I havepublished their emails in this

<p>Water - A must for new born babies <br>
Produced by the Sai Sanjeevini 
Foundation&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In India and in some other countries, mothers of new born babies are being 
given the dangerous advice that the baby must not be given any water for the 
first 6 months.&nbsp; This can result in irreparable damage to the baby's 
kidneys.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To live, 3 things are essential :&nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Air</li> 
<li> Water</li> 
<li> Food</li> </ul> Air and water are absolutely essential. Only Rishis and 
Yogis can do without these. Mother's milk is a complete FOOD but it cannot be a 
substitute for water and air.&nbsp;<br>
Our mothers gave us water - that's why 
we are alive today.&nbsp;
<p>The baby cries in atleast 4 distinct ways when it wants to tell the mother 
what it needs:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>1. Crying for food (milk)&nbsp; <br>
2. Crying for sleep or carrying&nbsp; 
<br>3. Crying in pain&nbsp; <br>
4. Crying for WATER.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Every grandmother KNOWS and most mothers soon get to know these 4 ways of 
crying. The baby has no other way of communicating with you except by crying. 
God made it so. Human knowledge - even that of doctors - cannot replace what 
God made.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3> Please use your own common sense and your instinct to decide what is good 
for your baby.&nbsp;</h3> Remember : There are millions of cells that die every 
day in the body and millions of new cells are born to replace the dead ones 
each day. This is true of all living creatures including little babies. These 
dead cells have to be flushed out by the body EVERY DAY. If they remain in the 
body they produce TOXINS i.e. POISONS.&nbsp;
<p>The only way these dead cells or toxins can be flushed out of the body is 
if the baby drinks adequate water.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3> Source of this dangerous&quot;advice&quot; and the reasons behind it.</h3>
 When asked, most doctors are very vague as to the source of this 
&quot;advice&quot; being given to mothers of newborns. Most are equally vague 
about the reasons for this &quot;advice&quot;. However we understand that two 
reasons are most often given both of which, as we explain below, do not make 
any sense:&nbsp;
<ul> 
<li> that mother's milk is complete - no water is therefore needed.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> Yes - mother's milk is a complete FOOD but it cannot substitute water and 
air. Besides, mother's milk also contains toxins passed on by the mother and 
only water can wash these out of the baby's body. (In very much the same way 
that cow's milk contains DDT and other pesticides that the cow takes in, the 
toxins that the mother takes in and also those which her own body produces, are 
passed on to the baby in the milk)&nbsp;
<ul> 
<li> that water is often contaminated and can cause &quot;infection&quot; in 
the baby.&nbsp;</li> </ul> This is a most ridiculous reason since bacteria is 
every where! The baby puts its own hands and fingers into the mouth and these 
are LOADED with bacteria picked up by the baby from the environment.&nbsp;
<p>What happens when there is lack of water in the body? <br>
Our body is made 
up of 80% water. Every few hours our body throws out poisons from the body in 
the form of urine. If there is insufficient water, the toxins become 
concentrated and can result in severe &quot;clogging&quot; of the kidneys, 
resulting in dangerous kidney disorders AND EVEN KIDNEY FAILURE.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is a frightening thought that vested interests are behind this move to 
make kidneys fail. We hope and pray that that is not so - that this 
&quot;advice&quot; is at best a mistake and a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How much water does a baby need? <br>
There is no standard quantity. When 
the baby needs water it cries for it in a particular way - from the throat - 
you hear a sort of double sound indicating a cracking of the voice due to 
dryness. The baby will only drink as much as it needs - no more.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How to give water to a baby?&nbsp; <br>
If your baby is a new-born, boil 
the water with a few grains of sauf (fennel seeds) and one or two whole pepper 
balls.&nbsp;Strain, cool and give to the baby in a baby bottle. Some babies 
prefer a few drops at a time given from a silver spoon.<i>(For breastfeeding 
mothers it is best to avoid using a baby bottle because of the possibility of 
nipple confusion resulting unwanted weaning. Instead use a regular household or 
medicine spoon. Shirley)&nbsp;</i> </p> 
<p>Silver has traditionally been used in India for feeding the baby. There is 
good scientific reasoning behind this. Silver inhibits the survival and growth 
of all kinds of germs. If your baby is over 3 weeks old and you have so far not 
given any water, then try the above method - if the baby rejects it (since it 
is an unfamiliar texture and taste), then add a touch of honey.&nbsp;<i> ( NOTE
: Be careful about giving honey to infants because honey is known to cause
botulism in babies. I would never give honey to an infant. Shirley)</i> </p> 
<p>Not everyone agrees with the following article. Please read the other 
points of viewfrom readers' emails </p> 
<p>Juices cannot replace water - there is no replacement for water. If you 
wish your baby's well-being -PLEASE GIVE HIM OR HER WATER. </p>

cleared from THAT - the Resident Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent Supreme

<p>&quot;Every function inside the body is regulated by and depends on water. 
Water must be available to carry vital elements, oxygen, hormones, and chemical 
messengers to all parts of the body. Without sufficient water to wet all parts 
equally, some more remote parts of the body will not receive the vital elements 
that water supplies. Water is also needed to carry toxic waste away from the 
cells. In fact, there are at least 50 reasons why the body needs sufficient 
water on a regular, everyday basis. Without sufficient water to constantly wet 
all parts, your body's drought-management system kicks into action. The 
histamine-directed chemical messenger systems are activated to arrange a new, 
lower quota of water for the drought-stricken areas. When histamine and its 
subordinate &quot;drought managers&quot; come across pain-sensing nerves, they 
cause pain. This is what I discovered in my research that I mentioned earlier. 
This is why dehydration produces pain as its first alarm signal. If the 
dehydration persists and is not corrected naturally with water, it becomes 
symptom-producing and, in time, develops into a disease condition. This is why 
people who take antacids to silence their bodies&#146; thirst pain become more 
vulnerable and eventually develop other serious complications of dehydration. 
Medical professionals have been educated to treat pain and disease with 
medications. They do not understand the problems associated with dehydration. 
Nowhere in their training as doctors are they taught what happens if one does 
not drink an adequate amount of water every day. &quot;&nbsp;<i> F.

author, a medical doctor, believes that he has found chronic dehydration to be 
the cause of many conditions including asthma, allergies, arthritis, angina,

Batmanghelidj, the body possesses many different thirst signals. A dry mouth is 
not a reliable indicator of your body's water needs. He describes a variety of 
more reliable ones, and helps you learn to understand when your body is calling 
for water. In this way, he claims you can prevent, treat, and cure a variety of 
conditions of ill health, at no cost, with what he calls nature's miracle 
medicine: Water. The author explains how much water one needs to drink a day to 
stay healthy, and why tea, coffee, and sodas are not good substitutes for 
water.&nbsp; This book explains a new discovery that lack of water in the

<p>According to Pediatrics magazine, many children don't drink enough water 
because they were raised on sugared beverages and juices. Substituting juices

become accustomed to sweet flavor. Unfortunately, this is not surprising. New 
soft drinks, sports drinks and powdered mixes that are targeted to children are 
frequently introduced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Shirley:&nbsp; Your article addressing the so-called &quot;need&quot; 
for water is based on a religious text.&nbsp; You should preface your article 
with this information for your readers, so they will know this is a religious 
belief, rather than a scientifically based article.</p> 
<p>The first clue is the statement, &quot;Air and water are absolutely 
essential. Only Rishis and Yogis can do without these.&quot; This is a 
religious belief, as is the belief that breastmilk does not supply sufficient 
and adequate fluid for the newborn.&nbsp; Of course, breastmilk supplies all 
the fluid a newborn needs, and adding water only throws the system out of 
balance.&nbsp; Parents following yogi teachings need to make their own 
compromises between their child's health and their religious beliefs.&nbsp; I 
am glad at least they are not advocating denying the child air or food, as some 
unfortunatel belief systems do.</p>

<p><b>Regarding water for breastfeeding infants:</b> <br>
1-If the water in 
breastmilk isn't sufficient, why do women from tropical climates make milk with 
a higher water content? Same for women in climates that change with the seasons 
who have more water in their milk during the hotter seasons?<br>
2-If it is 
necessary to have water that is not part of another &quot;food&quot;, does that 
mean that adults shouldn't drink water with meals or that water drunk with 
other foods doesn't &quot;count&quot;?<br>
3-As far as comparing with animals 
whose young drink water soon (as was stated in one response from the original 
writer)-remember that different mammals make different composition milks based 
on the needs of that species.&nbsp; Human babies don't walk to the waterhole 
soon after birth!&nbsp; Human milk is much closer in composition to that of 
other animals whose young are born immature and totally dependent for nutrition 
(meaning both food and water).&nbsp; It is also closer in content to mammals 
who nurse very frequently such as kangaroos&nbsp; whose young do not get 
seaprate water.&nbsp; Even the rabbit who only nurses a couple times in 24 
hours does not leave the nest to get water.</p> 
<p>I can't help but wonder if the infants cited who seemed to be short on 
water were not being nursed physiologically-in other words were being made to 
adhere to an arbitrary schedule rather than according to baby's needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt that there has been any scientific evidence of a different cry for 
water, especially in the early weeks and months.&nbsp; If babies 
&quot;knew&quot; the difference, would they be content to nurse if they truly

<p>Shirley,&nbsp; <br>
You have a lot of wonderful information on the Natural 
Health For Children page. But I am disturbed by the article stating that babies 
need water from a bottle. First of all, babies need nothing from a bottle, or 
God would've equipped us with bottles and breasts. Second, a woman's breasts 
produce the perfect food and drink for her baby. The first few minutes of each 
feeding consist of &quot;foremilk&quot; which contains much of the proteins, 
vitamins, and lactose. It quenches the baby's thirst. After that comes the 
thicker &quot;hindmilk&quot; which provides the baby with the fat he needs. 
This hindmilk is what satisfies his appetite. This is why babies are more 
likely to be satisfied after a complete feeding on at least one breast rather 
than a few minutes on each breast. He does not come away hungry if he's gotten 
the milk that comes down after several minutes of feeding.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By promoting bottle-given water for babies, you are also promoting 
potential nipple confusion. This is a very real problem for some babies.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>I hope you have carefully considered various angles before posting that 
article on your web page. If you have, well, I still disagree. &lt;g&gt; I

<p>Dear Shirley&nbsp; <br>
We have heard this argument from some quarters 
before (about giving water to babies) and it would be justified perhaps if all 
mothers everywhere were eating only natural, organic, uncooked food and not 
ingesting any pesticides, DDT, chemical fertilizers from any source whatsoever. 
Now we know that this is not at all possible and we also know that mother's 
milk is a big source of such chemicals and poisons getting to the baby. 
However, in spite of all this mother's milk is absolutely the ideal food. The 
person who is writing to you has shifted the emphasis from &quot;water&quot; to 
&quot;bottle&quot;. In India we actually do not use bottles for babies. We use 
pure silver bowls with silver spoons and we give the water a few drops at a 
time and very soon the baby wants the silver glass which is the next step. 
However I do not want to get into a discussion about containers. The question 
is of water. If there are toxins from the mother going into the baby - then the 
baby needs water to wash these out.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In my experience, the bottom line is the way the baby cries. If there are 
mothers whose children do not cry for water - well then, their milk must be so 
pure that they truly do not need it. But I have yet to come across such a baby. 
There is a typical dry hoarse cry for water which all grandmothers recognise 
and crying in different ways is the only way a child can communicate with the 
mother.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The argument that animals do not bottle feed their young with water does 
not hold water because within a few days the animal baby in most cases can walk 
to the water - which the human baby cannot do. The animal baby almost from day 
one crawls to the mother's breast - the human baby has to be carried and 
physically put to the breast. So comparisons are not reasonable.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Each child is different and we as mothers have to &quot;listen&quot; well 
to the baby's needs. If our extreme and fanatical outlooks (however much 
towards nature they may tend) prevent us from this listening we would have 
harmed our babies more by being &quot;natural&quot;. There cannot be absolutes 
in this - we cannot say &quot;never&quot; give water and we cannot say &quot;so 
much water must be given&quot;. Each baby will take only how much he or she 
needs. Try it out - watch the difference in the baby's happiness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are some mothers who at an early age give a lot of fruit to their 
babies. This contains a lot of water and such children may require very little 
or no water - I find such children having very little of the hoarse cry.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>As to nipple confusion - well I have seen babies in the thick of their feed 
when the hind milk is coming - actually stop the feed, ask for water and then 
go back to the feed - almost exactly as adults tend to ask for water in the 
middle of a meal (considered by some to be an unhealthy practice - but that is 
another story) when the food is particularly dry. I think most babies also know 
when they want to change the breast - it is not the mother but the baby which 
usually asks for a breast change.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hope this clarifies to some extent your dilemma in understanding why we 
recommend water.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Upto now we have talked of mothers who are feeding their babies exclusively 
with breast milk and sometimes fruits. The truth is that 99.9999% of babies 
arefed formula and/or cows milk in addition to breast milk. What then? Our site 
also caters to these women and so does your site. There may be ideallyc 
situations but how many mothers are able to follow it - water is something that 
a mother wants to give instinctively - its doctors orders that say no water. 
The doctor also (sometimes) says give exclusively breast milk. They end up 
following all the advice that is convenient to them - they end up giving the 
formula and cows milk for their convenience and abstaining from the wter also 
since it is convenient not to have to worry about one more thing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You need to see the situation in India and other third world countries 
where advice that you and I have to give does not reach the common man. They 
are illiterate but they can hear the govt advertisement to go to the nearest 
medical centre if they are pregnant. The doctors actually end up selling 
Nestles milk powder (other brands too) to the mother - the money involved in 
this scandal is too large for words.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our Sanjeevini book is a handbook for healers - healers deal with these 
people and if they tell the mother to give water atleast some of the damage 
will be undone. They will not listen to anyone that breast milk is better than 
tinned milk - because the doctor saheb has told them so.&nbsp;</p>

Subject:&nbsp; about the article saying that newborns need 
water...&nbsp;<br>
Date: Sat, 20 Nov 1999 02:27:58 -0800&nbsp; <br>
From: 
&quot;Jeri&quot; &lt;approbat@aa.net 
<p>Hi! Well, I don't agree that exclusively breastfed babies need water. </p> 
<p>The article says that &quot;that water is often contaminated and can cause 
'infectiion' in the baby. This is a most ridiculous reason since bacteria is 
every where! The baby puts its own hands and fingers into the mouth and these 
are LOADED with bacteria picked up by the baby from the environment.&quot;</p> 
<p>I've read that many babies die because they get sick from mothers using 
contaminated water to mix their formula. Is this not true? The Baby Milk Action 
website athttp://www.gn.apc.org/babymilk/ claims that &quot;Where water is 
unsafe a bottle-fed child is up to 25 times more likely to die as a result of 
diarrhoea than a breastfed child.&quot; This Baby Food Action site
http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/danny/BFAG/ puts it this way, &quot;The water 
mixed with the formula is often contaminated. This leads to diarhhoea, 
malnutrition and often death.&quot; The page called &quot;McSpotlight on the 
Baby Milk Industry&quot; claims that &quot;Every 30 seconds, a baby dies from 
unsafe bottle feeding. . . . The risk of contracting serious diseases from 
bottle feeding is therefore high, but it is further compounded by the fact 
that, in the Third World, many people don't have access to a clean water supply 
with which to make up the formula, and poverty can lead to mothers 
over-diluting the formula to make it go further. Waterborne diseases fed 
straight to vulnerable babies causes what is now a common condition in many 
parts of the world - diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory infections, malnutrition, 
dehydration and commonly death - known as Bottle-Baby disease.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Also see The Dialogue on Diaharroea website at 
http://www.rehydrate.org/dd/html/dd49.htm#page2. It has some interesting 
articles. Here is a quote from one of them... &quot;Giving extra liquids is not 
only unnecessary, but may also be harmful because: The baby may spend less time 
breastfeeding, which means that the mother's breasts are less stimulated to 
produce breastmilk. A Brazilian study showed that breastfed infants, who 
received teas or water in the first days of life, did not breastfeed for as 
long as those who were exclusively breastfed during their first week (2). The 
extra fluids may be made with unsafe water and given in feeding bottles which 
are contaminated. In Peru, babies who received water and teas in addition to 
breastmilk had twice as many days with diarrhoea in any given month as those 
receiving only breastmilk (3). These findings were confirmed by recent research 
from the Philippines (4). Another Brazilian study showed that each additional 
daily 'feed' with teas or water was associated with a 40 per cent increase in 
diarrhoea mortality. An infant receiving three feedings of extra fluids a day 
was almost three times more likely to die than an exclusively breastfed 
infant'.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's an interesting quote from an article about the &quot;WHO Code&quot; 
http://www.lalecheleague.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVAprMay99p26.html on the La Leche 
League website : &quot;LLL Leaders know that six months of exclusive 
breastfeeding is recommended. Any other food or drink introduced during that 
time will replace breast milk, therefore the marketing of cereals, teas, juices 
or water for children under six months can be interpreted intending to replace 
breast milk and undermine breastfeeding.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

Breast-fed infants need water supplement
http://members.aol.com/tireswing/oldmyths.html#art3 </p> 
<p>Also, I have concerns about the suggestion in the article to add honey to 
the water. Please check out this article by Dr. Greene.
http://www.drgreene.com/970602.html He says that honey is an unsafe food for 
any infant and should not be given to children younger than 12 months old. He 
says, &quot;The concern is with infant botulism. Botulinum spores are found 
widely in soil, dust, and honey. Adults who swallow botulinum spores are almost 
never affected. When infants swallow the spores, however, the spores can 
germinate in their immature gastrointestinal tracts and begin producing 
botulinum toxin. This has occurred even when the honey was only used to sweeten 
a pacifier (European Journal of Epidemiology, Nov 1993).&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Okay, I've got to go breastfeed my baby now!! Talk to you later. :)

<p> </p> Danger of infant soy formula 
<p><b>Premature, early puberty related to soy products&nbsp;</b> <br>
Elaine 
Hollingsworth, director of the Hippocrates Health Center of Australia and 
author of Take Control of Your Health and Escape the Sickness Industry, writes 
about the terrible effects of<b>soy</b> products on children: &quot;I am not 
exaggerating when I say that HUNDREDS of people have rung me during the past 
year to tell me about dreadful health problems that started after taking up the 
soy habit. Serious thyroid malfunctioning is one of the most common 
complaints.&nbsp; This is not surprising, since it has been known for years 
that isoflavones in soy can depress thyroid function, causing autoimmune 
thyroid disease and even cancer. It is a medically recognised fact that our 
body absorbs significant amounts of what we put on our skin. With Certified 
Organic food rapidly becoming the nutrition of choice by the health conscious 
amongst us, why would you accept any less for your skin? of the thyroid. By far 
the worst calls are from women whose children have been fed soy formula.&nbsp; 
They tell me heartbreaking stories about baby girls who show signs of early 
maturation, such as underarm&nbsp; odour, breast development, body hair and 
even menstruation as early as two, three and four years of age! The risk 
appears to be greatest in girls who ingest soy formula for nine months or 
more.&nbsp; In baby boys, 12 months of soy feeding can lead to gross effects by 
the age of 11 or 12.&nbsp; Breasts can appear and testicles do not 
develop.&nbsp; Several women have rung asking what to do for these pathetic 
boys, who refuse to participate in sports, fearing shower-room ridicule, and 
who will be dependent upon thyroid drugs for life. I can't help, and I don't 
think anyone can.&nbsp; Nature did not intend infants to be fed hormones, and 
life-threatening consequences occur when they are. Of course, these horrible 
problems do not occur with every soy-fed baby, but is it worth taking such a 
chance?&nbsp; Your child will not thank you, and you may never have 
grandchildren. Drinking soymilk during pregnancy can cause a failure to produce 
breast milk, which can lead to feeding the baby soy formula.&nbsp; By far the 
worst cases of soy damage are reported to us by women who have drunk soy milk 
while pregnant, and then fed their babies soy formula.&nbsp; This is a deadly 
combination.&nbsp; These women cannot restrain their tears when describing the 
dreadful health problems their children have.&nbsp; They keep repeating to me, 
&quot;I didn't know, I just didn't know, the doctor told me to drink it for my 
bones and give him soy formula.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; </p> 
<li> Soy Formulas and the Effects of Isoflavones on the Thyroid - 
Environmental scientist and long-time campaigner<b>against soy-based infant 
formulas</b>, Dr Mike Fitzpatrick, warns about the risk of thyroid disease in 
infants fed soy formulas, high soy consumers and users of isoflavone 
supplements.&nbsp;</li> 
<li> High Soy Diet During Pregnancy And Nursing May Cause Developmental 
Changes In Children Two separate studies &#150; one in animals and the other in 
humans, suggest that a diet high in soybeans and other legumes during pregnancy

children.</li>

&quot;At the present time there are growing public and 
professional concerns about the safety of currently mandated childhood vaccine 
programs, as reflected in by a series of annual Congressional hearings in 
Washington DC that have taken place since 1999, sponsored by the U.S. House 
Government Reform Committee under the chairmanship of Congressman Dan Burton. 
At an annual conference of the American College for the Advancement of Medicine 
during April 2001, with several hundred physicians in attendance, when one of 
the speakers asked how many in attendance had concerns about the safety of 
current childhood vaccines, a large majority raised their hands. The Autism 
Research Institute of San Diego is now widely known as an active support group 
for families with autistic children and is one of the more active organizations 
in this field. Its founding director, Bernard Rimland, Ph.D., has provided the 
statistics that, in their experience, from 50 to 60% of parents with autistic 
children believe that their children were damaged by vaccines. In our own 
office we have seen many autistic children in recent years, and our own 
experience has been very similar, many parents reporting that deterioration of 
their children took place following vaccines.&quot;<b>Dr. Buttram</b> 
<p>A Criminal Consequence of Vaccine Injury: <br>
Misdiagnosed Shaken Baby 
Syndrome <br>
by Allan Phillips </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&quot;<b>Many infants who suffer the so-called 'shaken baby syndrome' 
may be victims of undiagnosed vaccine damage</b> </p> 
<p>Ever since mass vaccination of infants began, reports of serious brain, 
cardiovascular, metabolic and other injuries started filling pages of medical 
journals.&quot; Viera Scheibner, PhD</p> 
<p>Viera Scheibner, PhD: &quot;A great number of babies now die within days or 
within two to four weeks of birth afterhepatitis B vaccination, as documented 
by the records of the VAERS [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System] in the 
USA.) So, the baby stops progressing, starts deteriorating, and usually 
develops signs of respiratory tract infection. Then comes the second and third 
injections, and tragedy strikes: the child may cry intensely and inconsolably, 
may stop feeding properly, vomit, have difficulty swallowing, become irritable, 
stop sleeping, and may develop convulsions with accelerating progressive 
deterioration of its condition and mainly its brain function.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This deterioration may be fast, or may slowly inch in until the parents 
notice that something is very wrong with their child and then rush it to the 
doctor or hospital. Interestingly, they are invariably asked when the baby was 
immunised. On learning that the baby was indeed &quot;immunised&quot;, the 
parents may be reassured that its symptoms will all clear up. They are sent 
home with the advice, &quot;Give your baby Panadol&quot;. If they persist in 
considering the baby's reaction serious, they may be labelled as anxious 
parents or trouble-makers. So the parents go home, and the child remains in a 
serious condition or dies.</p> 
<p>Until recently, the vaccine death would have just been labelled 
&quot;sudden infant death&quot;, particularly if the symptoms and pathological 
findings were minimal. However, nowadays, with an alarmingly increasing 
frequency, the parents (or at least one of them, usually the father) may be 
accused of shaking the baby to death&quot; Viera Scheibner, PhD.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Alan Yurko was charged with aggravated child abuse and first-degree murder 
of his infant son, Alan; he is now serving a life sentence without possibility 
of parole at Washington Correctional Institution in Chipley, Florida. Mr. Yurko 
insists that he did not kill his son; rather, he now claims that his son died 
from a combination of medical mistreatment and an adverse reaction to 
immunizations. Doctors and scientists from 15 countries have rallied to support 
Alan&#146;s innocence, as have members of anti-vaccination/pro-choice groups 
from around the world.more </p>

There is an increasing amount of research being conducted into the possible 
link between autism and vaccination. Along with many other groups throughout 
the world, the Autism Research Unit is committed to examining the nature of 
this association through scientific research. -- Autism: Understanding and 
Implementing a Gluten and Casein Free Diet&nbsp;
<p><b>Vaccines Cancer and Leukemia: is&nbsp; there a link?</b> <br>
Among 
children, antibiotics andVaccines cause more adverse reactions than any other 
prescribed medicines, according to a Canadian study presented at the annual 
meeting of the American Academy of Allergy and Asthma in 1998. Sandra K. 
Knowles and her colleagues at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto 
reviewed Canadian data on more than 1,500 cases of drug reactions between 1985 
and 1995. The antibiotics amoxicillan and ampicillin accounted for 24 per cent 
of total adverse reactions, with vaccines coming in second at 19 per cent.<i>

&quot;Many here voice a silent view that the Salk and Sabin Polio Vaccines, 
being made from monkey kidney tissue, has been directly responsible for the 
major increase in leukaemia in this country.&quot;<i>Dr F. Klenner, M.D.</i> 
<p>&nbsp;Why are a growing number of parents and health care professionals 
around the world questioning vaccination? The controversy stems from the 
thousands of deaths and permanent disabilities attributed to vaccination 
annually, as well as the many published medical studies, government statistics, 
congressional testimonies, and other credible sources that directly contradict 
commonly held assumptions about vaccine safety and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Read about the personal stories of vaccine damage and its tiny victims. The 
chiIdren you will meet here suffered a severe reaction to a routine DPT 
(diphtheria. pertussis, tetanus), MMR (measles, mumps. rubella), or OPV (oral 
polio) vaccine. They are only a few of the thousands of children who have died 
or been left with medication resistant seizure disorders, mental retardation, 
physical handicaps, learning disabilities or other chronic illnesses after a 
reaction to a routine vaccination.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Bart Classen, a Maryland physician, published data showing that <b>
diabetes</b>rates rose significantly in New Zealand following a massive 
hepatitis B vaccine campaign in young children, and that diabetes rates also 
went up sharply in Finland after three new childhood vaccines were 
introduced.&quot;<i>Nicholas Regush ABCNEWS.com&nbsp;</i> </p>

<b>Dr. Jerry Tennant, M.D. </b>says that marine phytoplankton 
contains almost everything one needs to sustain life and to restore health by 
providing the raw materials to make new cells that function normally. These 
nutrients improve mental function, and memory. They reduce depression, harmful 
effects of stress, and mood swings.<b>Profound Life-Giving Properties of Marine

<p>Teas Are One of The Most Effective Ways to Benefit from Nature's Healing 
Herbs <br>
Teas can help fight depression and anxiety, heal skin conditions and 
gastrointestinal disorders, regulate hormone imbalances, improve your sex life, 
prevent illness, and&nbsp; help you heal&nbsp;faster.<b>&nbsp;</b> Many 
diseases and conditions for which we turn to modern medicine can also be 
treated naturally with healing herbs. These treatments can be safer, less 
expensive and possibly even more effective than traditional methods.<b>Dr. 
Myklebust, MD:</b> &quot;Teas are rich in antioxidants called polyphenols which 
are plant chemicals that may help prevent cancer, heart disease, and other 
diseases&quot;More <br>

<p>Childhood Insomnia We all struggle to sleep sometimes and children are no 
exception. Sometimes sleep problems become chronic and a pattern of insomnia 
sets in. This can cause much frustration for children and their parents and can 
even result in relationship difficulties if the problem is not addressed. If 
you find yourself struggling to put your child to sleep night after night, then 
it is important to do something about it. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Childhood Anxiety Children are also vulnerable to stress. Some children 
suffer from anxiety and shyness and may struggle to adjust to new situations 
like school and friendships. Others experience worries about their safety or 
have intense fear of the dark, insects, animals or other creatures. <br>

<p>Natural Remedy for Bedwetting Bedwetting is common during the pre-school 
years and children vary in their ability to control their bladders at 
nighttime. It is quite normal for a child under the age of five to wet the bed 
occasionally and boys often take longer than girls to become dry at night. 
'Accidents' do happen and should be dealt with kindly and sensitively in order 
to prevent emotional problems. Children who wet their beds should not be 
punished.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Natural Colic Remedy - Babies between the ages of 0 - 6 months often 
develop colic. This could be due to wind or other digestive problems or even 
the incorrect formula.Signs of colic include persistent fretfulness and crying 
(especially after feeds), and baby may become red in the face and pull up his 
legs to relieve the pain in his stomach.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Standard hospital practice is to place preemie twins in separate incubators 
to reduce the risk of infection. That was done for the Jackson girls in the 
neonatal intensive care unit at the Medical Center of Central Massachusetts in 
Worcester. Suddenly, Brielle went into critical condition. She began gasping 
for breath, and her face and stick-thin arms and legs turned bluish-gray. Her 
heart rate was way up, and she got hiccups, a dangerous sign that her body was 
under stress. Her parents watched, terrified that she might die.Learn how she 
was rescued by her twin <br>

<p>Raising Public Awareness <br>
Most modern maladies are caused by prolonged 
exposure to a combination of negative lifestyles and toxic environmental 
factors, including junk food and malnutrition, pesticides, antibiotics, 
microwaves, chemical pollution of food, water and air, lack of exercise and 
chronic stress. These factors are further aggravated by the failure of modern 
medicine to recognize them as agents of dis-&quot;ease&quot; and death and the 
consequent failure to take preventative measures against them.more <br>
