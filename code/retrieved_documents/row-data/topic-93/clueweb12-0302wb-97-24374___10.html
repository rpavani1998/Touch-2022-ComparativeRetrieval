<p>BOTTLED WATER<br>
 American consumers are drinking more bottled water every 
year, in part because they think it is somehow safer than tap water. They 
collectively spend hundreds or thousands of dollars more per gallon for water 
in a plastic bottle than they would for the H20 flowing from their taps. Tap 
water is generally just as safe, clean, and healthy as bottled water&mdash;in 
many cases even more so. By taking back the tap, you can save money, protect 
your health, and help prevent environmental and social problems as well.</p> 
<p>Safety<br>
 Despite what many consumers are led to believe, bottled water 
is no safer or purer than tap water. In fact, some bottled water is simply 
municipal water that has been wastefully packaged, falsely labeled as pristine 
spring water, and sold at an exorbitant price. According to the National 
Resources Defense Council, as much as 40 percent of bottled water is actually 
from a tap.</p> 
<p>What's more, water from the tap may actually be safer than water from 
bottles. This is partially due to the fact that the federal government requires 
more rigorous and frequent safety testing and monitoring of municipal drinking 
water. The Environmental Protection Agency requires utility companies to test 
municipal water hundreds of times per month, while the Food and Drug 
Administration requires bottling companies to test their supply only once per 
week. And due to shortages of funding and staff, FDA regulation of bottled 
water is even less stringent than these basic guidelines would suggest. The 
administration has less than one full-time employee in charge of bottled water, 
and regulations apply only to the 30 to 40 percent of bottled water that is 
sold across state lines.1</p> 
<p>The inadequacy of bottled water regulations was documented by the National 
Resources Defense Council which tested 1,000 bottles from 103 brands and found 
bacteria, carcinogens, and other chemicals in a significant number of the 
products.2 Some of these contaminants can be traced to the water source, others 
are byproducts of the purification process, and still others leach from the 
plastic bottle.</p> 
<p>Environmental Damage<br>
 In addition to avoiding contaminants, giving up 
bottled water also benefits our environment. Annual production of the plastic 
(PET or polyethylene) bottles required to meet U.S. consumer demand for bottled 
water uses the equivalent of about 17.6 million barrels of oil, not including 
the cost of transporting the product to consumers. That volume of oil more or 
less equals the amount required to fuel over one million vehicles on U.S. roads 
each year. Worldwide, bottling of water uses about 2.7 million tons of plastic 
each year.3</p> 
<p>In the end, about 86% of empty plastic water bottles in the United States 
land in the garbage instead of being recycled.4 This means approximately two 
million tons of PET plastic bottles pile up in U.S. landfills each year. Single 
serve water bottles and other beverage containers, often used on the go, are 
recycled at a lower rate than containers typically used at home. Between 1995 
and 2005, the national recycling rate for all PET type #1 plastic fell from 
39.7 percent to 23.1 percent.5 Ultimately, many plastic bottles of all types 
and sizes will be incinerated, which releases toxic byproducts such as chlorine 
gas and ash laden with heavy metals.6</p> 
<p>The production and transport of bottled water products causes pollution and 
contributes to global warming. In 2005, the journal<i>Nature</i> published a 
study showing how climate change could diminish both underground and surface 
(e.g., lakes and rivers) water sources around the world that are dependent on 
melting snow. With warmer periods, earlier snowmelt could mean that &quot;much 
of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans&quot; unless there 
are adequate water storage systems.7 But this, like protecting water sources 
from pollution, requires money. It also means halting or severely curbing 
Nestle, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and other commercial bottlers from taking spring 
water and municipal water to be bottled into easy profits.</p> 
<p>Social Problems<br>
 Beverage companies also harm communities with their 
bottled water operations. The companies extract vast quantities of water that 
local people need, making huge profits and leaving the locals with depleted 
resources in addition to economic and environmental problems. Despite promises 
that bottling operations will bring employment, in reality they create few new 
jobs, and those few are dangerous and low-paid.</p> 
<p>Cost<br>
 Turning to tap water will not only benefit communities, the 
environment, and consumer safety, it could help save money as well. While 
bottled water can cost between $0.89 and $8.26 per gallon, tap water typically 
only costs about $0.002 per gallon.8,9,10</p> 
<p>Giving Up Bottled Water is Not Enough<br>
 Although the majority of U.S. 
tap water is clean, safe, and healthy, public water systems in some communities 
fall short of consistently meeting EPA safety standards. These violations 
likely stem from some combination of pollution of the water source, inadequate 
water treatment, or deteriorating infrastructure (e.g., pipes that carry water 
can have lead or be old and falling apart).</p> 
<p>Sign the <b>Take Back the Tap Pledge</b> to join tens of thousands of 
consumers who are pledging to reduce or eliminate their consumption of bottled 
water.</p> 
<p>To solve these problems, action from federal, state, and local governments 
must be taken to protect the quality and integrity of our water resources. Part 
of the solution will require investing in the maintenance and renewal of 
municipal water and sewage treatment plants, storage, and distribution. Most of 
the primary water pipes and sewer lines in the United States were built during 
the late 1800s, the 1920s, and in the years immediately following World War II.
11 They are wearing out under the weight of time and increasing demand. Old, 
corroded water lines can break, not only wasting water but also opening avenues 
for contamination. Worn out or overburdened sewage systems can overflow into 
our streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans, creating serious health concerns. The 
National Research Council recently warned of more water-borne disease outbreaks 
unless we make &quot;substantial investments&quot; in improving our drinking 
water and sewage storage and distribution systems.12</p> 
<p>Every year, Congress debates proposals for funding clean drinking water. A 
2007 bill provided $14 billion in federal loan guarantees over four years for 
water and sewer improvements. While the bill passed the House of 
Representatives, it has not yet passed the Senate. Unfortunately, even if it 
were to become law, it would still be insufficient in meeting our nation's 
water infrastructure needs.13</p> 
<p>Collectively, our communities fall about $22 billion short annually of what 
they need to maintain and improve public drinking water and sewage systems. 
Federal dollars are the only way to address this clean water infrastructure 
funding gap estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Government 
Accountability Office, and the non-profit Water Infrastructure Network at 
between $300 and $500 billion over 20 years. Much of the funding gap stems from 
government cuts to clean water programs.</p>

<p>Common Questions and Answers About Tap Water</p> 
<p><b>Q: Why should I choose tap water over bottled water?</b><br>
 A: Bottled 
water costs hundreds or thousands of times more than tap water, and although 
bottled water companies would like you to believe that their product is somehow 
better than tap water, most tap water is just as clean and safe as bottled 
water, and much less expensive.</p> 
<p><b>Q: How do I find out whether my tap water is safe?</b><br>
 A: Locate 
the contact information of your local water utility on one of your latest bills 
to request a copy of the Annual Water Quality Report, also referred to as the 
Consumer Confidence Report. This report is required by law to provide 
information about contaminant violations in the water system. EPA posts many of 
these results on its websitewww.epa.gov/safewater</p> 
<p>Local health departments often provide testing services or have lists of 
accredited laboratories that do the testing. Look in your phone book to find 
the contact information for your local health department.</p> 
<p><b>Q: What can I do if my water is contaminated?</b><br>
 A: Select a 
filter that removes the particular contaminants that are present. For tips on 
how to choose a filter, see
http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/take-action/consumer-tools/choosing-a-water-filter
</p> 
<p><b>Q: Can a filter remove chlorine and fluoride?</b><br>
 A: When it comes 
to chlorine, the answer is &quot;yes.&quot; Most water filters remove or reduce 
this chemical disinfectant. On the other hand, fluoride is more of a challenge. 
Typically, only reverse osmosis filters and distillation units reduce or remove 
it.</p> 
<p><b>Q: My water tastes funny. What can I do about it?</b><br>
 A: Odd 
tasting water does not necessarily mean that it is unhealthy or contaminated. 
The taste could be due to chlorination or to the mineral content in the water, 
depending on the region of the state or country. A home filtration system is 
the best solution to this problem.</p> 
<p><b>Q: What kind of reusable bottle should I use to carry tap water?</b><br>

 A: Many people have concerns about plastic food containers and beverage 
bottles because some chemicals in the plastic can leach into the contents. For 
this reason, Food &amp; Water Watch recommends either stainless steel or lined 
aluminum bottles.</p> 
<p><b>Q: Should I reuse disposable plastic bottles?</b><br>
 A: The disposable 
PET #1 plastic bottles in which many beverages are sold cannot be properly 
cleaned and, over time, may leach plastic components into the water. Therefore, 
they should not be reused.</p> 
<p><b>Q: What is a contaminant?</b><br>
 A: Water is very rarely pure H2O. It 
tends to grab particles from things it passes and brings them along for the 
ride. Whether flowing in a mountain stream or pouring out of your faucet, water 
usually contains more than just oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. Some of these 
piggybackers are harmless, but many are not.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees the safety of tap 
water, currently regulates 87 different contaminants. The agency recognizes but 
does not regulate an additional 51 contaminants.</p>
