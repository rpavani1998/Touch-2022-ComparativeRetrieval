<h1>On-Site Alternate Water Sources&nbsp;&amp; Use Introduction</h1> 
<p>There are many water sources available on building sites that can 
supplement the more traditional water sources.&nbsp; These water sources are 
non-potable, and vary greatly in quality.&nbsp; Most of the on-site water 
resources have limited application, and are never suitable for human 
consumption.&nbsp; The following is a brief overview of such resources that may 
be available in both residential and non-residential settings.</p> 
<h2>Rain Water Harvesting</h2> 
<p>Probably the original alternate water source, rainwater harvesting dates 
back to pre-historic times in rudimentary forms.&nbsp; Some plants and animals 
use the practice to enhance survival.&nbsp; Desert plants, such as agave, form 
concave appendages to capture rain drops and direct the water towards the root 
zone.&nbsp; Porcine root out pits capturing rain water to form small 
ponds.&nbsp; By 300 B.C., the Nabataeans had already built miles of an 
elaborate rain water collection system and storage cisterns to supply water to 
their city of Petra, in what is now the country of Jordan.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>In whatever size and form, rainwater harvesting usually is one of the 
purest waters available of all the alternate water sources.&nbsp; Despite its 
imitial&nbsp;purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; 
heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead 
soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and 
mosquitoes.&nbsp; It is never advised to use untreated rainwater for direct 
human consumption,&nbsp;though&nbsp;human have been consuming it for centuries 
with little documented ill-effects when&nbsp;precations are taken 
to&nbsp;prevent contamination.&nbsp; It is often&nbsp;advised 
for&nbsp;people&nbsp;to avoid prolonged skin contact, and be wary of the stored 
water becoming septic or a breeding place for mosquitoes and pathogens.&nbsp; 
It has also been observed that residents of home cisterns tend to be more 
tolerant of their own cistern water quality than visitors that imbibe in the 
cistern water..</p> 
<h3>Rain Barrels</h3> 
<p>There is a growing trend of water utilities offering free or 
price-discounted pre-fabricated plastic rain barrels to residential 
customers.&nbsp; These barrels are connected to the downspouts of the 
home&rsquo;s roof gutters to collect the rain water from the roof.&nbsp; The 
rain barrels include a tap at the bottom of the barrel for users to attach 
garden hoses as a means to convey the water to landscape plants.&nbsp; (Rain 
water is superior to treated potable water for irrigating 
plants.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The barrels also have an overflow spout and hose to 
divert excess water away from the home&rsquo;s foundation.</p> 
<p>A typical 1,000 sq, ft. (92.9 square meters)roof can collect 624 gallons 
(2.4 m3) during a 1 inch (2.54 cm) rainfall, but it is seldom practical or 
possible to harvest and store this volume of water with rain barrels.&nbsp; 
Roofs very seldom direct all of the water to one downspout.&nbsp; Most often 
there are four or more downspouts, one at each corner of the house.&nbsp; 
Capturing all of the rainwater requires the resident to attach rain barrels at 
every downspout. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each rain barrel will store only 50 to 60 gallons 
(189.2 L to 227.1 L) of water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Capturing the full 624 gallons (2.4 
m3) requires more than 12 rain barrels. &nbsp;At a cost of $80 to $120 per 
purchased rain barrel, a system with a 624 gallon (2.4 m3) capacity will cost 
more than $1,200.&nbsp; (A do-it-yourself project will cost about $20/barrel in 
hardware, assuming a used plastic barrel is available free of charge)</p> 
<p>The economic benefit-cost ratio of rain barrel systems is not favorable 
when compared to most potable water prices.&nbsp; Even when a ten-year 
lifecycle is used for the barrels in a rainy US climate, the water collected 
over the ten years would cost approximately $4.55 per CCF, and this assumes the 
water is put to beneficial use and replacing potable water use.&nbsp; The 
problem is&nbsp;the barrels are filled when it rains; a time the landscape 
probably does not need additional water.&nbsp; Once the barrels are full, they 
cannot collect additional water until emptied.&nbsp; When there is little 
beneficial use for the water during the rainy season; thus, the rainwater is of 
little economic value.&nbsp; During parts of the country with dry summers, the 
water is valuable, but rainfall is too infrequent to regularly refill the 
barrels as needed.</p> 
<p>In most climates, rain barrel systems should be valued for the 
rainwater&rsquo;s superior quality (no chlorine, chloramines and other 
treatment chemicals) as irrigation water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some caution should be 
exercised for using the collected rainwater to irrigate crops intended for 
human consumption.&nbsp; The water might absorb heavy metals from the roofing 
materials and gutters; and the water might contain E. coli, absorbed from bird 
and animal droppings from the roof surface.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rain barrel systems can be a great way to harvest rain water to supplement 
irrigation needs.&nbsp; To properly evaluate its application and benefits, one 
must consider the frequency of local rain events that occur during the 
irrigation season.&nbsp; Also consider the need to drain and bypass the rain 
barrels during monsoon seasons of freezing weather.&nbsp; &nbsp;While it is 
true that the rainwater can be used to flush toilets, the added cost of 
equipment to convey the water to the toilets&nbsp;might hamper overall cost 
effectiveness;&nbsp;one barrel of water is unlikely to supply more than&nbsp;3 
days worth of flushing water for the typical home.&nbsp; In general, larger 
rainwater storage systems will often be more cost effective than rain barrels 
if the water is to be used beyong&nbsp;local landscape 
irrigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Cisterns</h3> 
<p>A cistern is defined as any tank used to store water.&nbsp; Most often the 
word &ldquo;cistern&rdquo; refers to an underground tank storing rainwater 
collected from roofs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cisterns were once very common in the US, 
especially in rural areas where homes relied on private wells for 
water.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cisterns were used to supplement the well water, 
especially during extended droughts when groundwater levels&nbsp;receded below 
well depth. &nbsp;Except in emergencies, the cistern water was not used for 
drinking, food preperation or bathing.&nbsp; Harvested rainwater is considered 
potableonly&nbsp;after proper treatment and disinfection.</p> 
<p>Cisterns fell out of favor in the US as water utilities provided treated 
potable water at extremely low cost. &nbsp;In rural areas, the advances in well 
drilling technology allows for deeper wells, where groundwater levels seldom 
fall below well depth.&nbsp; Many older cisterns were once considered a health 
and safety hazard, and were backfilled or removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 
past few years, as water becomes scarce and more precious, cisterns have 
re-emerged with new technological advances and safety.&nbsp; &nbsp;Harvesting 
rainwater is no longer limited to rural areas or water conservation 
practitioners.</p> 
<p>The green building industry is slowly but steadily advancing water 
conservation and rain water collection in its strategies; and cisterns provide 
a means to store the rainwater for later use.&nbsp; Even high-rise office 
buildings are now collecting rain water in cisterns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reducing storm 
water flows is often a main impetus of rainwater roof collection and cisterns 
in urban settings. &nbsp;In some designs, the cisterns hold additional 
alternate water resources (gray water, condensate, cooling tower blow-down, 
etc.) along with the rain water for uses beyond irrigation of landscape.&nbsp; 
The various alternate water sources are collected in the cistern, and often 
filtered and sanitized for use in flushing urinals and toilets throughout the 
building.</p> 
<p>Cisterns come in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Historically, cisterns were 
made underground pits lined with stone, mortar, plaster or cement; topped with 
a reinforced concrete roof, at grade level.&nbsp; Today, cisterns are often 
prefabricated from cement, fiberglass, or plastic; usually placed underground 
to hide from view and prevent freezing in colder climates.&nbsp; There are some 
above grade installations made of steel or fiberglass tanks.&nbsp; New 
inventive designs are using corrugated steel bins (originally fabricated for 
grain storage) with a plastic liner to create a water vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
typical cistern storage capacity ranges from 500 to 10,000 gallons per cistern 
(1.9 m3 to 37.8 m3)&nbsp;; although multiple cisterns are often interconnected 
in large building sites.</p>

<h2>Stormwater Harvesting</h2> 
<p>Generally, the term stormwater harvesting refers to rainwater collected 
from non-roof surfaces, such as parking lots, hardscapes, and landscapes 
surrounding urban buildings.&nbsp; Managing stormwater in urban environments 
has reached near crises levels in some US cities as urban sprawl grows and 
landscapes are paved over with non-porous materials (concrete and 
asphalt).&nbsp; In typical US cities, where 50% of the landscape is paved over, 
a 1 inch rain event produces more than 150 million gallons (567,811.8 m3) of 
stormwater per square mile.&nbsp; Strategies to capture and utilize this water 
include: landscaping designs to retain water in soil; semi-porous hardscape 
material; diverting the water to holding tanks or retention ponds for 
irrigation use; and diverting stormwater to groundwater recharge sites.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Government agencies encourage or require implementing many of the 
stormwater reuse strategies.&nbsp; In Florida and California stormwater is 
being diverted to retention basins at groundwater recharge sites.&nbsp; Tucson 
Arizona requests residents to build berms and swales in their landscape to 
retain the rainwater.&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas provides sales tax exemptions for 
rainwater capture and reuse systems.&nbsp; The Texas Cities of Austin and San 
Antonio offer rebates for rainwater capture and reuse.1</p> 
<p>It is important to be cautious when using stormwater as an alternative 
water supply.&nbsp; This water may collect many pollutants as it travels across 
landscapes and hardscapes.&nbsp; Landscapes often contain fertilizers, 
herbicides, pesticides, fungicides and animal feces.&nbsp; Parking lot and 
roadway surfaces are coated in motor oil, antifreeze, exhaust soot, and other 
automobile fluids.&nbsp; Sidewalks surfaces often contain food waste, 
especially near fast food establishments.&nbsp; Some water agencies have 
determined landscape water run-off to be a major cause of non-source point 
pollution in groundwater supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of stormwater varies 
greatly from different sites; the water quality determines the appropriate 
uses, or if water treatment is needed before the water is utilized.</p>
