<h2> World Water Day 2012 </h2> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Water in the UK
</strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>22nd March will be World Water Day </strong>( 
http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/). Water is a critically important 
resource, and recent news stories have really started to emphasise how 
carefully we need to look after it.<strong>Even in the UK</strong>, supposedly 
renowned for our rainy weather, we are suffering from a<strong>major drought
</strong>. A very dry winter means that ground water supplies, which most of us 
rely on for our drinking water, have not been replenished leaving us with the 
very real prospect of running short. And don&rsquo;t be fooled by the recent 
rain &ndash; the National Farmers&rsquo; Union say that<strong>&lsquo;several 
months&rsquo; of steady rainfall is needed</strong> to relieve drought 
conditions.<br>
<br>
<strong>In the Greenhouse</strong>, we have water butts 
that<strong>use rain water</strong> from our gutters for watering plants and 
for feeding the loos and hand basins. The toilets are &lsquo;dual flush&rsquo; 
so that they use less water when you only do a wee. We provide tap water in the 
cafe for drinking, rather than bottled which has additional transportation 
impacts. At home, you can put a full bottle of water or a &lsquo;hippo&rsquo; 
in your toilet cistern to reduce the amount of water (processed to drinking 
standards) that is needed to fill it and which gets literally flushed down the 
drain needlessly. There are some information leaflets on the right hand side of 
the website front page that will give you more ideas for saving water at home.
<br> <br>
<strong>Water in our food</strong> <br>
<br>
But the water that comes 
out of our taps and down our loos, while critically important for the 
UK&rsquo;s water supplies, is only a small part of the story.<strong>Most of 
the water we use is embedded in the food we eat</strong>, and the products we 
buy:<strong>producing 1 kilo of beef for example consumes 15,000 litres of 
water while 1 kilo of wheat &rsquo;drinks up&rsquo; 1,500 litres</strong>. This 
means it is really important to buy seasonal, local and unprocessed food to 
minimise our water use. When a billion people in the world already live in 
chronic hunger and water resources are under pressure we should not pretend the 
problem is &lsquo;elsewhere&rsquo;. Coping with population growth and ensuring 
access to nutritious food to everyone call for a series of actions we can all 
help by:<br>

<ul> 
<li>following a healthier, sustainable diet</li> 
<li>consuming less water-intensive products</li> 
<li>reducing the scandalous food wastage: 30% of the food produced worldwide 
is never eaten</li> 
<li>producing more food, of better quality, with less water.</li> </ul> <br>

Please take a look at the website you&rsquo;ll be surprised by some of the 
facts, and whilst you think about what you can do, please take a moment to pass 
the information on.<br>
