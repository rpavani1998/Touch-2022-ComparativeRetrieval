Accounting<br>

<br> HOW MUCH CAN WE AFFORD TO LOSE? <br>
<strong>Kathryn Savage, Northern 
Arizona University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The teaching objectives for this case include increasing student&rsquo;s 
abilities to:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; analyze and document basic activities of sales 
and cash collections in a simple setting; (2)&nbsp; evaluate risk of loss from 
cash collections resulting from internal control deficiencies and (3)&nbsp; 
recommend appropriate controls for cash collections. Applicable concepts 
illustrated include procedures for:&nbsp;&nbsp; transaction authorization and 
recording, segregation of duties, custody of cash, and physical protection of 
assets.&nbsp; This case is appropriate for any graduate or undergraduate 
accounting class where internal controls are analyzed and documented.&nbsp; 
Depending on how curriculum is structured, this could include courses in 
accounting information systems, internal auditing and external auditing.</p> 
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Troy Wheeler, associate dean of the School of Business and Public Policy at 
Westland University was asked to write a letter to the university&rsquo;s 
internal auditor reassuring the auditor that controls on the cash register in 
the college were adequate to prevent major theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Troy wrote the 
letter, but the request awakened nagging concerns regarding cash control with 
respect to the register in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The register was primarily 
used to sell course packets to students, and while only about $20,000 of cash 
passed through the register each year, the more Troy thought about it, the more 
concerned he became about the potential for loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he was the 
one who signed the deposit slip, he felt considerable responsibility to 
evaluate the control system for the register.</p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troy met with 
Lily Woodring, the business manager for the school, in order to increase his 
knowledge of current procedures and maybe suggest some changes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the internal auditor, Lily had already 
filled out a self evaluation for cash and check handling.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
addition to this document, Troy got Lily&rsquo;s answers to a longer, more 
specific list of questions.&nbsp; Equipped with this information, Troy needed 
to make feasible recommendations to improve control.

THE BOOKSTORE 
COOPERATIVE: TEXTBOOK TRAVAILS <br>
<strong>Elizabeth Grace, San Jose State 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case illustrates the difficulty of inventory valuation and management 
in an evolving market. Students are introduced to the effects of rapid market 
changes on demand for textbook inventory and the effects of obsolescence on 
financial statements. The case details operations of a college bookstore, the 
Bookstore Cooperative, and focuses on valuation and timing of obsolete textbook 
write-downs, retail inventory accounting and flawed inventory controls. The 
Bookstore Cooperative director questions whether newly discovered textbook 
obsolescence is serious enough that board members need be apprised and whether 
the losses will be reported in current year financial statements.&nbsp; The 
Cooperative textbook manager is concerned with control procedures to prevent 
large, obsolete textbook inventories from building up again.&nbsp; The case 
objectives are: to develop a logical approach to accounting-oriented 
decision-making using<em>Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2</em>, 
to apply analytical auditing procedures to a business with a high level of 
student familiarity, and to design a set of control procedures that minimize 
future obsolete inventory. The case demonstrates how a client&rsquo;s business 
and its environment affect the identification of inherent risks related to 
inventory.The case was written for business school undergraduate courses in 
intermediate accounting and auditing.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The Bookstore Cooperative, a university auxiliary running bookstore 
operations, was contemplating an overvalued inventory at year-end.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The overvaluation was largely a result of changes in the textbook industry, 
including more frequent text revision cycles and increased competition from 
internet sellers and e-books, as well as traditional competitors.&nbsp; The 
immediate issues were to account for the valuation loss for inventory of 
non-returnable, obsolete books and to value the remaining retail inventory for 
reporting purposes.&nbsp; Since the non-profit employed generally accepted 
accounting principles, it was required to report its inventory accordingly, 
valuing inventory at lower of cost or market.&nbsp; Of long-term concern to the 
management of the Cooperative was the need to manage the risk of inventory 
obsolescence. Managers needed to assess the weaknesses in inventory management 
processes and develop control procedures minimizing future inventory 
obsolescence.</p>

TROUBLE AT RENT-TEX <br>
<strong>Erin Corley, Nicole Powell 
&amp; Aundrea Kay Guess</strong><strong>St. Edwards University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case shows students how theft can occur even with a proper system of 
internal controls.&nbsp; Red flags are missed in both the application of the 
employee and the life style of the employee after she is hired.&nbsp; The case 
was written for undergraduate or graduate classes in the area of auditing, 
fraud, ethics, and/or entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Major topics include internal 
controls, ethics, small business, and accounting entries.&nbsp; The objectives 
are for students to be able to analyze facts related to fraud detection, 
evaluate internal controls and policies/procedures in a small entrepreneur 
office setting and apply ethical and fraud frameworks.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
<strong>Rent Tex (A)</strong> </p> 
<p>Rent Tex was a family orientated rent-to-own business that operated ten 
stores throughout Texas. Three partners bought Rent Tex in 2001 for investment 
purposes. Dan Albright, President of Rent Tex, had been a CPA for over twenty 
years with experience in the rent-to-own industry.&nbsp; He was the only 
partner involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.&nbsp; Rent Tex 
started with five stores and quickly expanded to ten.&nbsp; Most clients rented 
the household items with the possibility of buying them in the future.&nbsp; 
One morning the police arrived at the Rent Tex office and arrested the 
bookkeeper.&nbsp; The officer informed Albright she had been convicted of 
embezzlement but was being arrested because of a probation violation.&nbsp; 
Albright immediately started an investigation of Rent Tex books to determine if 
Webb had stolen from the company.&nbsp; He was convinced the internal controls 
were sufficient to prevent theft and believed he would find no irregularities.
&nbsp;Students are challenged to try to determine if, and how, a theft might 
have occurred based on information in the case and exhibits, and evaluate 
internal controls, red flags, hiring practices and company procedures</p> 
<strong></strong> <strong>Rent Tex (B)</strong> Case B reveals that fraud had 
been perpetrated by the bookkeeper.&nbsp; Dan Albright was faced with the 
decision of whether to pursue prosecution against her.&nbsp; He discovered that 
the fraud was concealed through payroll entries.&nbsp; The question of what 
internal control had been circumvented or omitted caused him anxiety.

BAYER CROPSCIENCE: THE PUBLIC&#146;S RIGHT TO KNOW? <br>

<strong>Steven M. Cox &amp; Bradley W. Brooks, </strong><strong>Queens 
University of Charlotte</strong><strong>Ilonka Aylward, Aylward Family Law
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case examines the potentially conflicting interests of potential 
public health concerns, public security concerns and PR and brand management 
issues after a crisis.&nbsp; The chemical explosion may have endangered nearby 
citizens but public disclosure of the incident could alert terrorist 
organizations to key security information.&nbsp; Public disclosure could also 
damage the Bayer brand image.&nbsp; This case is designed to facilitate 
discussion in graduate and undergraduate courses in business ethics and/or 
social responsibility.&nbsp; It is also well suited for discussion as in 
graduate and undergraduate courses on consumer behavior, particularly when 
studying brand image and positioning as well as brand equity.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>An explosion at the Bayer CropScience (a component of Bayer Group) plant in 
Institute, West Virgina on August 28th, 2008 could be felt for miles.&nbsp; The 
explosion occurred around 10:35 pm when an industrial tank of methomyl, a 
highly toxic chemical used in pesticides, ignited into a fireball that left a 
visible cloud hovering around nearby residential areas.&nbsp; With a history of 
incidences, the plant moved quickly to minimize the damage.</p> &nbsp; Bayer 
cooperated withthe U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB), the federal organization 
to investigate chemical hazards, by providing numerous documents regarding the 
incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p>When CSB announced that is wished to publicize all the information received 
from Bayer, the corporate legal team evoked disclosure protection of federal 
laws created to ensure homeland security, including the Maritime Transportation 
Security Act (MTSA).&nbsp; </p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case considers whether the public&rsquo;s rights to access information 
regarding a health hazard would supersede the public&rsquo;s need to be 
protected from the threat of terrorism.&nbsp; </p>

ExI CORPORATION <br>
<strong>Daniel F. Jennings, Texas A&amp;M 
University</strong><strong>Lane Batson &amp; Aaron Schrems</strong><strong>
Protec Equipment Resources, Inc.</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case describes the unethical behavior of a partner in a business who 
has been rebuffed in an attempt to buy-out his business partner. ExI 
Corporation rents a variety of test equipment to large manufacturing firms, 
power plants, and to firms in different process industries and also provides 
qualified engineering technicians that will operate the test equipment during a 
turnaround. The partner&rsquo;s unethical behavior involves (1) using $1 
million of ExI&rsquo;s cash and equipment to start a company that will compete 
against ExI; (2) luring customers away from ExI, and (3) taking important 
documents from ExI&rsquo;s files. The case also describes the dilemma faced by E
xI&rsquo;s remaining partner as he attempts to salvage ExI&rsquo;s 
profitability. The case was written for use in a course in which Ethics is 
taught at either the undergraduate or graduate level. The course can also be 
used in an executive education program.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>ExI Corporation was started six years ago by Kenneth Davis and Ronald Maak. 
Kenneth who also owns another company which is highly profitable invested $1.5 
million in the venture and Ronald made no monetary investment in the start-up. 
Kenneth played a major role in planning and implementing ExI&rsquo;s start-up. 
After the start-up phase, Kenneth agreed to withdraw from the day-today 
activities of managing of ExI, leaving those tasks to Ronald. Portia, 
Ronald&rsquo;s wife is hired to manage ExI&lsquo;s finances and administrative 
services and Ronald&rsquo;s personal friend, Jason Henry, becomes ExI&rsquo;s 
sales manager. During ExI&rsquo;s start-up, Kenneth and Ronald agreed that upon 
achieving certain milestones Ronald would own 49% of ExI and then have the 
opportunity to acquire Kenneth&rsquo;s 51%. However, at the time the ownership 
agreement was developed between Kenneth and Ronald, nothing was specified on 
how much Ronald would pay Kenneth for Kenneth&rsquo;s portion of ExI, nor was 
any methodology agreed upon on how the value of Kenneth&rsquo;s ownership would 
be determined.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>Six years later, ExI has become extremely profitable and Ronald has 
achieved a 49% ownership of ExI. Ronald offers Kenneth $1 million for 
Kenneth&rsquo;s share of ExI and is rebuffed. Following a very confrontational 
meeting, Ronald, Portia, and Jason Henry leave ExI. Following an outside audit, 
Kenneth learns that Ronald has taken $600,000 in equipment and $400,000 
belonging to ExI to start a competing company. Ronald is faced with the task of 
rebuilding ExI.</p> 
<p></p> This case was made possible by a corporation that prefers to remain 
anonymous. All names and locations have been disguised. It is prepared as a 
basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or 
ineffective handling of an administrative situation. All rights are reserved to

FORTIS AND THE CHALILLO DAM: BALANCING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT <br>
<strong>Robert W. Sexty, Memorial University of 
Newfoundland</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case is focused on a decision that Fortis Inc. management must make 
relating to a hydropower dam that will enhance the economy of Belize but that 
will also harm the environment. The magnitude of ENGO activities in opposition 
to the project is outlined as well as the economic benefits. A linkage is made 
to published research on the strategies of ENGOs and why they target particular 
projects. The case demonstrates the challenges of balancing the economic, 
social and environmental benefits and harms when involved with a large 
construction project in a developing company. The case illustrates how a 
corporation decides whether or not to proceed with a project given substantial 
and sustained opposition.</p> 
<p>The case is written for courses in business and society, business ethics, 
and business and the environment.&nbsp; It might also be appropriate for 
global/international business and corporate strategy courses. It is written for 
senior undergraduates but is appropriate for graduate level and management 
development courses.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Fortis Inc., a company with interests in various North American electric 
utilities, is proposing to build the Chalillo dam on the Macal River in Belize, 
Central America. The dam would contribute to the economic development of the 
country by meeting the increasing demand from industry and consumers for 
electricity. The company believes that the dam is the most feasible, reliable 
and cheapest supply of electricity. Environmental non-governmental 
organizations (ENGOs) oppose the project because of the destruction of wild 
animal and plant life and its adverse downstream impact, and allege that there 
are more viable and more cost effective sources.&nbsp; The case reviews the 
company&rsquo;s presence in Belize, the environmental impact studies, and the 
activities of the ENGOs during 2001.&nbsp; At the beginning of 2002, management 
is faced with a decision of whether or not to go ahead with the project.</p>

HEAVEN HELP US 
<br> <strong>Aundrea Kay Guess &amp; Carolyn Conn</strong><strong>St. 
Edward&rsquo;s University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case was designed for use at both the undergraduate and graduate levels 
in courses such as business ethics, general business, or management.&nbsp; 
Major topics include ethics, ethical decision-making and corporate governance.
&nbsp;A 90-minute class should be adequate for discussion of the case if 
students have reviewed the case prior to class time.&nbsp; It could be used as 
an exam case, as a means of testing the students&rsquo; ability to identify and 
understand ethical dilemmas, ethical theories, and other influences on 
decision-making which are specific to the non-profit sector.&nbsp;</p> &nbsp; 
The case purposely ends in a way that may cause students to immediately begin 
to identify alternative courses of action for the protagonist.&nbsp;However, 
&ldquo;which&rdquo; action plan the protagonist should utilize is not the right 
question.&nbsp; Instead, it should be &ldquo;whether&rdquo; the protagonist 
should get involved at all.&nbsp; Many times an individual is faced with an 
ethical dilemma because their own values and those of their employer are in 
conflict.&nbsp; This case is unique in that both sets of values are aligned; 
but, acting on those values (&ldquo;doing good&rdquo;) may put both the 
protagonist and his employer at risk.<strong></strong> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Larry Barnes, Executive Director of the Southwest Missouri Baptist 
Association (SMBA), received a telephone call that no CEO wants.&nbsp; The 
pastor at Hilltop Baptist Church called to report his suspicions of 
embezzlement by the church&rsquo;s long-time bookkeeper.&nbsp; Whatever course 
of action Barnes suggested to the pastor would impact the church, its members, 
the SMBA, the community, and a number of stakeholders, including himself.</p> 
&nbsp; 
<p>Barnes worried about jeopardizing his working relationship and his many 
friendships with Hilltop&rsquo;s members, particularly if the accusations were 
incorrect.&nbsp; Of equal concern was whether the church would continue to 
exist.&nbsp; Financial problems had plagued Hilltop in recent years and the 
relationship between the pastor and members was already contentious.&nbsp; An 
embezzlement scandal could cause the 150 year-old church to close its doors. 
His primary duty as Executive Director was to provide guidance and advice to 
pastors of SMBA churches, to help them expand, and to assist in establishing 
new churches.&nbsp; However, did his professional responsibilities encompass 
embezzlement?&nbsp; If not, did he have an ethical obligation to help?&nbsp; 
What if his involvement put him and his employer at risk?</p> 
<p></p> The names of all entities, their locations, and the people involved in 
this case have been disguised.&nbsp; The authors developed the case for class 
discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling 
of the situation.&nbsp; The case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and synopsis were 
anonymously peer reviewed and accepted by the North American Case Research 
Association (NACRA) for its annual meeting, October 29-31, 2009, Santa Cruz, CA.

HELEN DRINAN: GIVING VOICE TO HER VALUES 
<br> <strong>Mary Shapiro &amp; Cynthia Ingols</strong><strong>Simmons College 
School of Management</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>In preparation for discussing the Helen Drinan case, M.B.A. students study 
the &ldquo;Giving Voice to Values&rdquo; (GVV) curriculum.&nbsp; GVV, developed 
by Dr. Mary Gentile, Aspen Institute Center for Business Education and the Yale 
School of Management, enables students to develop strategies for handling 
situations where an organization&rsquo;s values are in conflict with their own. 
The Drinan case may be taught in a career strategies course because the 
decision to act or not act in a values conflict situation is heavily weighted 
by potential career-threatening consequences. The Drinan case and GVV may be 
used in organizational behavior (OB) courses that discuss ethical issues.</p> 
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In early 2006, Helen Drinan, Senior Vice President, Human Resources, 
Caritas Christi Health Care, Boston, received two sexual harassment charges 
against the organization&rsquo;s CEO and President Robert Haddad.&nbsp; While 
she knew she was legally charged with acting, she faced a complicated situation:
&nbsp;the hospital system is owned and operated by the Archdiocese of Boston 
with Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley as the Chairman of the Board; and these charges 
came soon after the priest molestation cases which rocked the Catholic Church 
of Boston.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Case A, Drinan presented the well-documented results 
from an independent investigator into the sexual harassment charges against 
Haddad. Although Drinan&rsquo;s investigator presented clear evidence as to 
Haddad&rsquo;s guilt, the Cardinal decided to launch a second investigation, 
using the Church&rsquo;s lawyers.&nbsp; Drinan, interpreting this action as a 
delaying or avoidance tactic, decided that she must act. But, what should she 
say, to whom and how should she frame this critical conversation?&nbsp; In Case 
B, students learn how Drinan acted in this tough, politically charged situation 
and the outcome of her actions.</p>

</p> 
<p>In Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico, the microbrewery La Minerva recentedly 
launched a new beer named Malverde. The figure, Malverde, is well known as 
&acute;the saint of drug traffickers.&acute; The case analyses whether La 
Minerva&acute;s decision to name the beer, Malverde was or was not ethical.
&nbsp;La Minerva was a small business without sufficient resources to conduct a 
publicity campaign for their latest beer and the controversy provoked by the 
name provided publicity that the company needed but could not afford. However, 
a class visiting the microbrewery asked each other &uml;was this decision 
ethical? &uml;&nbsp; </p>

MOODY&#146;S CREDIT RATINGS AND THE SUBPRIME 
MORTGAGE MELTOWN <br>
<strong>Anne T. Lawrence, San Jose State University
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This descriptive case explores the role of a leading 
credit rating agency in the financial crisis of 2008.&nbsp; Intended for use in 
a graduate or upper-division undergraduate course in business and society, the 
cases spans a range of topics, including corporate social responsibility, 
stakeholder analysis, codes of ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, 
government regulation of the securities industry, shareholder rights, and 
personal responsibility.&nbsp; As such, it may be used in conjunction with 
coverage of any of these topics or as an integrative assignment towards the end 
of the course.&nbsp; It may also be used in a course in business ethics, in the 
context of a discussion of conflict of interest or moral hazard; or in the 
course in finance, in the context of a discussion of ethics.&nbsp; After 
studying the case, students should be able to:&middot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analyze the impact of a credit 
rating firm&rsquo;s actions on multiple stakeholders;&middot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apply the concept of 
&ldquo;conflict of interest&rdquo; to a particular fact situation and propose 
strategies to eliminate or reduce that conflict of interest;&middot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluate the respective 
responsibility of credit rating agencies and their executives, home buyers, 
mortgage lenders, investment bankers, government regulators, policymakers, and 
investors for the financial crisis of 2008; and&middot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formulate an appropriate 
strategy for society to protect investors&rsquo; interests with respect to the 
integrity of the credit rating system.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In the mid-2000s, Moody&rsquo;s, the world&rsquo;s leading credit rating 
agency, evaluated thousands of bonds backed by subprime residential 
mortgages&mdash;home loans made to people with low incomes and poor credit.
&nbsp;When housing prices began to decline in 2006, the value of many of these 
bonds collapsed, and Moody&rsquo;s was forced to downgrade them steeply.&nbsp; 
In late 2008, several investment banks, commercial banks, and mortgage lenders 
that had been heavily involved in the subprime market failed.&nbsp; In the wake 
of these failures, credit froze up, consumer confidence plunged, and job losses 
deepened across the global economy.&nbsp; Although the financial crisis had 
many causes, some analysts believed that Moody&rsquo;s and other credit rating 
agencies had played a key role by underestimating the risks inherent in 
mortgage-backed securities.&nbsp; The case draws on publicly available data, 
including internal documents released by Moody&rsquo;s in connection with a 
Congressional hearing in October 2008, to explore the multiple causes of the 
financial crisis and Moody&rsquo;s role in it.&nbsp; It challenges students to 
consider how businesses, governments, and society can better assure the 
integrity of the credit rating industry.</p>

SARAH MANAGER&#146;S 
ETHICAL DILEMMA <br>
<strong>Anahid Saeidi, Christian Que &amp; Rahul Gupta
</strong><strong>California State University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case is an illustration of the ethical dilemma that Sarah Manager 
underwent as former manager of an indoor air quality wholesale company called 
High Quality-IAQ Ultraviolet Products (HQ-IAQ UV).&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah either had 
to turn a blind eye towards a trusted employee&rsquo;s illegal activities or to 
report her trusted employee&rsquo;s wrongdoings to uphold her duty as a trusted 
manager of the company.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>HQ-IAQ UV Products was founded in 2000 as a wholesale dealer of indoor air 
quality (IAQ) products. The primary target market of HQ-IAQ UV Products was 
contractors who installed heaters and air conditioners.&nbsp; The owner of the 
company was Skip Bossman.&nbsp; The company&rsquo;s leading sales 
representative, Emily Colleague, worked for Sarah Manager, the manager of the 
company.&nbsp; Ms. Manager was under the direct supervision of Mr. Bossman.
&nbsp;HQ-IAQ&rsquo;s UV units were designed to purify the air in homes.&nbsp; 
These products were manufactured to be handled, installed and repaired by 
specialized technicians.&nbsp; If UV bulb components were not handled properly, 
they may cause harmful effects, such as blindness or death.</p> 
<p>Due to Emily&rsquo;s knowledge in the IAQ products industry, she had many 
opportunities for professional growth within the company.&nbsp; Emily was a 
high achiever, as evidenced by her hard work and dedication. During early 2005, 
Emily began to face personal hardships that directly affected her professional 
performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Emily&rsquo;s sales commissions 
decreased significantly, which resulted in economic hardship.&nbsp; Sarah began 
to feel sympathy for Emily&rsquo;s personal and professional situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah covered up Emily&rsquo;s absenteeism and tardiness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sarah implicitly allowed Emily to steal the 
company&rsquo;s UV bulbs, with the purpose of Emily selling the items on eBay 
for Emily&rsquo;s economic gain.</p> 
<p>Sarah was caught in an ethical dilemma: To continue to assist a close 
colleague in distress or to demonstrate loyalty to the company by informing her 
superior regarding her colleague&rsquo;s pilfering activities?</p>

SOS FOR THE SEACOAST SCIENCE CENTER (SSC) <br>

<strong>William Naumes &amp; Margaret J. Naumes</strong><strong>University of 
New Hampshire</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The Seacoast Science Center (SSC) case is designed to provide students with 
an opportunity to analyze and discuss the roles of top management and the Board 
of Directors in a not for profit organization.&nbsp; It is also designed to 
demonstrate the importance of long term planning while making short term 
decisions.&nbsp; It asks how management and the Board should respond to 
financial problems brought on by reductions in funding sources. Most not for 
profits face such problems even in the best of times.&nbsp; During economic 
downturns, most not for profit organizations face decreased donations.&nbsp; 
Since economic downturns occur periodically, students should become familiar 
with the process of facing decreased funding, and how to deal with those 
issues. The case can be used in a variety of courses, including Business, 
Government and Society (BGS), Strategic Management, Not For Profit Management, 
and Corporate Governance, at either the senior undergraduate or graduate level. 
In BGS, the case would be used in that section of the course dealing with 
governance, and the interaction between management and the Board of Directors.
&nbsp;The case can also be used in that section of the course relating the 
mission to the environment.&nbsp; The case can be used in the section of the 
course dealing with stakeholder relations.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Wendy Lull, President of the Seacoast Science Center (SSC), a not for 
profit organization, located in Rye, New Hampshire, has just realized that 
instead of a break even budget for fiscal year 2009, the organization is faced 
with a potential $180,000 deficit.&nbsp; Several of the members of the Board of 
Directors had announced that not only would they have to reduce their donations 
to the organization, but that they had heard from other donors that they would 
also have to do the same.&nbsp; The economic downturn of 2008-09 was mentioned 
as the cause for these reductions in donations. Since 80% of the expenses for 
the SSC were related to personnel costs, Wendy knew that most cost savings 
would have to come from personnel costs.&nbsp; Wendy and her V.P. had come up 
with several potential options for cost savings.&nbsp; One was that the Board 
fire her, since her salary was the largest personnel expense. Other proposals 
included reducing everyone&rsquo;s salary, reducing benefits for all employees, 
eliminating several other positions, and reducing several of the positions to 
half time.&nbsp; All of the options would have serious implications for the 
short and long term operations of the organization, and its mission.&nbsp; </p>

</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case is a follow-on to Arthur Sherman and John Seeger, &ldquo;A 
Troubled Time in the Courtyard,&rdquo;<em>The CASE Journal</em>, 3:2, Spring 
2007 (abstract available at caseweb.org)<em>.</em>&nbsp; This case is suitable 
for graduate or upper-division undergraduate courses, or course segments, in 
ethics, corporate culture, non-profit organization management, strategic 
management, public policy, law, and real estate.&nbsp; It is likely to be 
especially well-received in executive and part-time MBA programs, where many 
students are members or former members of homeowner associations (HOAs).&nbsp; 
Also, the case is useful in training programs for real estate professionals and 
property managers involved in owner association administration.&nbsp; HOAs are 
an often neglected type of non-profit corporation, though they govern the lives 
of more than 50 million Americans and produce an estimated $50 billion in 
annual revenue.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Sam Ryan came to Austin, Texas in 2007 to stay with his Aunt Mary in the 
Courtyard while he earned his MBA.&nbsp; He found the subdivision both diverse 
and beautiful.&nbsp; The values of the 320 homes there ranged from around 
$150,000 for some townhomes to as much as $2 million for the twenty or so 
dwellings that enjoyed frontage on Lake Austin.&nbsp; The neighborhood had an 
elaborate park and extensive walking trails.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>A resident told Sam of an attempt by the HOA, a non-profit corporation, to 
take over the waterfront behind his home and eleven others.&nbsp; He learned 
that the HOA was continuing its aggressive behavior mainly focused on one 
homeowner, a retired management professor who had helped defeat the walkway 
effort.&nbsp; Certain disgruntled neighbors of the professor were apparently 
collaborating with the Apgars, who headed the HOA and its architectural 
committee.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The professor claimed to have been wrongly accused of several covenant 
violations, threatened with a lawsuit and refused access to HOA records.&nbsp; 
Letters from a lawyer hired by the Apgars, apparently without board approval, 
seemed to tell a story of harassment of the professor and lack of attention to 
legal niceties.&nbsp; By August 2007, the lawyer had pulled back but the HOA 
directors were threatening to take matters into their own hands by removing a 
line of large pots Sherman had installed without architectural committee 
approval.</p>

collapses on the floor of his one room unit after vainly trying to revive his 
dead brother and unconscious sister- in- law. His last thoughts while hitting 
the floor are full of despair and anger &ndash; anger at the UCC management and 
officials who did not pay heed to the unsafe production practices &ndash; 
despair that no one listened to his cry for help and support when he had felt 
&lsquo;something was not right!&rsquo;</p>

VERMILION IRON MINING COMPANY <br>
<strong>Tom Morris &amp; Tara 
Ceranic</strong><strong>University of San Diego</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The Vermilion Iron Mining case is used to specifically discuss ethical 
decision-making, this case can also be tied in to a variety of topics 
throughout the duration of a course. The strategy in presenting this case is to 
focus on the ethical decision-making aspect of the Board of Directors. In order 
to do so it is necessary to provide a brief introduction to basic ethical 
theories such as Utilitarianism, Formalism, Rights, etc. prior to assigning the 
case. Utilizing these theories as a foundation, instructors can then proceed to 
conduct an ethical assessment of the issue that the Board faces.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The Board of Directors of for Vermilion Iron Mining Company is faced with a 
difficult decision. Since the early 1900s Vermilion had operations in the tiny 
town of Ely, Minnesota. In 1967 Vermilion was forced to abandon its operations 
in Ely due to the increased cost to remove the hematite (high grade iron ore) 
deep within ore fields. Vermilion&rsquo;s departure from the mines of Ely was 
devastating. Not only were mining jobs lost, but the entire town was affected. 
The population of Ely dropped drastically leaving the town a shell of its 
former self.</p> Recent research found that it is now possible to extract the 
remaining hematite in the ore fields and an option for a return to the mines of 
Ely is now on the table with the Board of Directors of Vermilion. However, the 
hematite supply will only last for three to four years and then it will be 
necessary to depart from Ely. Although bringing business back to Ely would be 
beneficial, there is concern from Josh Nordland, a Board Member that was born 
and raised in Ely, that proceeding with this plan would revive the town only to 
devastate it once again. The CEO and Chairman of the Board, Jon Eriksson though 
is focused on the stockholders and his dedication to their needs. Now a 
decision must be made.<em>Should Vermilion return to Ely to mine the remaining 
hematite for the sake of the shareholders, or should they consider the town and 
all of the individuals that re-newed mining in Ely would affect?</em>

ABBOTT LABORATORIES: HERO OR VILLAIN IN THE GLOBAL HIV/AIDS 
EPIDEMIC? <br>
<strong>Amy Lussetto (student) &amp; Rebecca J. Morris</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;University of Nebraska at Omaha</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
Abbott Laboratories had developed a potent drug 
(Kaletra) that the World Health Organization considered to be the preferred 
HIV/AIDS treatment in resource-restricted societies.&nbsp; Although widely 
lauded for this innovation, Abbott was also under fire from AIDS activists and 
the governments of Thailand, Brazil and Mexico (among others) over the pricing 
of the drug.&nbsp; This case challenges students to examine the balance between 
Abbott&rsquo;s moral responsibilities as the producer of a potent life-saving 
drug and the firm&rsquo;s obligations to maximize the wealth of its 
shareholders.&nbsp; By examining the company&rsquo;s relevant stakeholders and 
their interests, students are asked to develop and evaluate strategies for 
effectively responding to the issues Abbott faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;This case is 
suitable for graduate or upper-division undergraduate courses in business and 
society, business ethics, marketing strategy, or strategy.&nbsp; It is 
especially useful in modules dealing with stakeholder analysis, environmental 
analysis and pricing strategies. Courses that include modules on intellectual 
property may also find this case useful.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This case focuses on the issues faced by Abbott Laboratories in 2007.&nbsp; 
Abbott utilized a tiered pricing strategy for Kaletra, charging lower prices in 
less developed countries to make the drugs more affordable.&nbsp; Higher prices 
were charged in more developed/high income countries such as the United States.
&nbsp;Despite the firm&rsquo;s attempt to make Kaletra more widely available in 
countries where demand was high but ability to pay was low, the firm&rsquo;s 
pricing strategy was widely criticized.&nbsp; Abbott faced pressure from 
governments (Brazil, Thailand and Mexico are covered in the case) to 
significantly reduce Kaletra prices or the governments would break 
Abbott&rsquo;s patent protection and produce generic equivalents themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How could Abbott continue to achieve the firm&rsquo;s overarching 
goal&mdash;&ldquo;to advance medical science to help people live healthier 
lives&rdquo; while simultaneously appeasing the governments, critics and the 
activists?&nbsp; If Abbott cut the price in every country that complained, how 
would the firm continue to fund cutting-edge research and development?&nbsp; 
Was Abbott a hero or a villain?</p>

ALLOW THE 
BARBARIANS THROUGH THE GATE? <br>
<strong>Arieh A. Ullmann, Binghamton 
University, SUNY</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case has been written in order to introduce ethical aspects of decision 
making into the undergraduate/graduate introductory strategy course. The case 
focuses on the CEO of a US-based Japanese subsidiary who is confronted with a 
situation that, while not illegal, runs counter his personal ethics. However, 
following his ethics by making a counter offer to the envisaged Chapter 11 
filing entails putting his own career and personal wealth at risk.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case requires students to ponder a decision of personal ethics based on 
a solid understanding of the industry and the company. Often, strategy and 
ethics are treated as separate issues. In this case, a counter offer only makes 
sense if the strategic analysis indicates that there is a chance for the 
company to prosper in the future. Therefore, students will have to analyze (1) 
the competitive trends in the industry; and (2) the company&rsquo;s resources 
and capabilities in the light of #1. (3) Based on these 2 steps students can 
then develop and evaluate options with regard to their strategic, financial and 
ethical dimensions. (4) As part of #3 students will have to make suggestions 
how to negotiate with the Japanese owners as well as (5) offer a 
post-acquisition strategy. The last objective therefore closes the loop and 
links back to #1 and #2.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The case deals with a company in the PVC pipe industry. This is a rather 
obscure industry providing a product that we all take for granted without much 
thought. The case deals with a crucial decision the CEO of National Pipe &amp; 
Plastics (NP&amp;P) has to make, namely whether he should remain passive and 
let the Japanese corporate owners of NP&amp;P file for Chapter 11 as part of a 
sale to a private equity firm. If this were to happen NP&amp;P would probably 
be liquidated and all personnel would be dismissed. Since the CEO considered 
this to be immoral he pondered buying the company himself. This was risky 
because the company was in debt, and he would need to borrow the funds. Very 
little time was left and rumors about the impending bankruptcy were flying.</p> 
&nbsp; 
<p>The case describes the industry, its key material PVC and the producers of 
PVC resin; the mode of competition in the pipe industry and the checkered past 
of the company as a basis for developing a post-acquisition strategy should the 
current CEO decide to negotiate a risky acquisition.</p>

CONTINENTAL 
AIRLINES &#150; 2009 <br>
<strong>John J. Vitton &amp; Jonathan B. Northard
</strong><strong>&nbsp;University of North Dakota</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case study was developed to examine the complex interaction of 
political, economic and competitive forces in the general and industry 
environments that impact upon an airline&rsquo;s profitability and ultimate 
survivability.&nbsp; The case was designed to hone analytical skills and 
decision-making ability and provide opportunities to apply Michael 
Porter&rsquo;s Five Forces Model, Barney&rsquo;s VRIO Model, and 
Slywotsky&rsquo;s Value Migration theory.&nbsp; Other objectives involve 
exploring why many of the major airlines are suffering staggering financial 
losses and bankruptcy. Is the problem the hub and spoke structure, the 
inability to cope with escalating fuel and labor costs, inefficient aircraft 
mix, or is it a lack of experienced, effective, visionary management leadership 
needed to turnaround an airline in trouble?&nbsp; This case was primarily 
designed for undergraduate, graduate, and executive level courses in strategic 
management.&nbsp; It may also be of interest in union management courses and in 
the curricula of university aviation departments.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The case study opens by focusing on a fatal accident involving Continental 
Airlines flight 3407 on February 12, 2009 and its bearing upon the 
airline&rsquo;s ridership and crew training. The growth of the airline industry 
is addressed from its earliest passenger flight (1914), to the delivery of mail 
(1920s), and the attendant legislation governing and nurturing the aviation 
industry that created the Civil Aeronautics Act (1938) which regulated 
competition and prices, the Federal Aviation Act (1958) overseeing safety, and 
the Airline Deregulation Act (1978), which marked the end of the reign of 
government over an infant industry that had outgrown its diapers.&nbsp; The 
swashbuckling founding years of Continental Airlines, functional aspects of 
airline operations, Continental&rsquo;s competition, and the turnaround after 
two Chapter 11 bankruptcies by Gordon Bethune, who lead Continental from worst 
in the industry to first, and the post- Bethune years.&nbsp; The case ends by 
questioning whether Continental beset by high fuel prices, cut-throat 
competition, and a deep recession and the retirement of the highly respected 
Gordon Bethune, a $585 million loss in 2008, and a series of accidents can 
right itself and fly safely and profitably into the future.</p>

COSTCO: MAXIMUM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OR MAXIMUM SHAREHOLDER RETURN? <br>
<strong>
Chelse Nieri &amp; Rebecca Treadway</strong><strong>&nbsp;Maryville College
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case describes a company that broke the mold in the warehouse 
membership industry to become the industry leader. Costco offered limited 
quantities of low-cost, high-quality merchandise to warehouse members.&nbsp; 
Costco prided itself on offering excellent employee compensation and benefits.
&nbsp;Over the years, Costco&rsquo;s stock price rose; yet, so did Wall Street 
criticism. Some analysts questioned the expensive use of company funds on 
employees; while others believed Costco&rsquo;s methodology served them well 
and substantively contributed to the increasing stock price.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>This case provides students with the opportunity to apply stakeholder 
theory to a company.&nbsp; Students can identify Costco&rsquo;s primary 
stakeholder groups and determine the relative importance each group has for the 
company.&nbsp; Students can examine the weaving interrelationships between 
groups.&nbsp; The case beckons the questions &ndash; should shareholders be 
considered the most important stakeholder group?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a most 
important stakeholder group?&nbsp; What effects do stakeholders groups have on 
one another?&nbsp; The case was written for an undergraduate Strategic 
Management course.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Costco entered the warehouse industry in 1983 and established their first 
store in Seattle, Washington. From the early years, Costco had a strong 
commitment to members to provide merchandise with high value and low-prices.
&nbsp;They had a growing reputation as a company that valued employees by 
providing above-average compensation. In the late 1990s, as competition 
increased and pressure to perform in the stock market escalated, many warehouse 
companies cut employee costs. Costco did not follow suit.&nbsp; Costco operated 
under the tenant that happy employees translated into satisfied customers and 
profitable shareholders. Some analysts raised issue with Costco&rsquo;s 
approach.&nbsp; The title of a <em>Wall-Street Journal</em> article clearly 
stated the issue at hand - should Costco be kind to its employees or to its 
shareholders. Costco had been creating value for its shareholders, with 
increased stock prices, but would a decrease in employee expenses create more 
value? Management was left to ponder this question.</p>

<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This case dives into possibly the most dramatic business development of 
recent decades, the globalization of the information technology services 
industry that exploits the almost instant transfer of data between continents. 
It explores the phenomenon at global, industry, and business levels from both 
USA and Indian perspectives.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The material includes: (1) an industry description with examples of how the 
industry functions inside corporations.; and (2) details of seven industry 
competitors including three based in the United States (Accenture, Electronic 
Data Systems, and IBM,) and four based in India (Tata Consulting Services, 
Infosys, Wipro, and Cognizant.) Summary descriptions are provided also of

GO GREEN MART AND MORE: GROWING 
MORE GREEN ONLINE? <br>
<strong>Artem Meshcheryakov (student) &amp; Christopher 
Cassidy</strong><strong>&nbsp;Marshall University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case presents the reader with the opportunity to analyze a newly 
developed internet company by putting them in the position as primary decision 
maker.&nbsp; Go Green Mart is an internet business in the first years of 
existence and seems to be having trouble growing despite the seeming growth of 
demand for green products.&nbsp; The major issues for students to deal with 
involve defining the organization&rsquo;s mission, analyzing the business model 
and strategy, and determining the actions necessary to implement the strategy.
&nbsp;Questions and decisions for the reader to discuss involve the affiliation 
with Amazon.com, the need for additional time and marketing investment, and the 
likelihood of increasing the performance of the business.&nbsp; The ultimate 
objective for students is to determine a course of action that will improve the 
performance of Go Green Mart.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>This case was developed for use in a graduate level Business Policy and 
Strategy course but would be ideal for courses focused on strategy, 
entrepreneurship and ecommerce at both the graduate and undergraduate level.
&nbsp;There is a significant marketing component, which might make the case 
suitable in a strategic marketing class.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The growth of environmental awareness has accelerated in recent years 
resulting in the growth of consumer demand for &ldquo;green&rdquo; products, 
which are products that result in or are produced with less environmental 
damage than traditional products.&nbsp; It is with this awareness that Halcyon 
Moses founded Go Green Mart and More in 2008 (http://www.gogreenmartandmore.com
).&nbsp; Go Green is a commercial website selling environmentally friendly 
products selected personally by Halcyon.&nbsp; Halcyon hired a local web design 
firm to design the website which won the American Graphic Design Award for 2008.
&nbsp;The problem for Go Green Mart is that the expected growth has not 
materialized.&nbsp; </p>

KUAN LONG PLASTIC INJECTION INC: STRATEGIC 
PLANNING DEVELOPMENT FROM SCRATCH <br>
<strong>An Ni Chen &amp; Laura Whitcomb
</strong> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;California State University Los Angeles</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The core learning objective of this case centers upon how to prepare and 
implement the strategic planning development for a small family business in 
Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This case is designed to be used in an undergraduate or 
graduate course in strategic management or strategic planning.&nbsp; The case 
could also be used in a small business management course or in a comparative 
management course, because it illustrates management in a typical Chinese 
family business in Taiwan.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>As China keeps growing at an unprecedented rate, many neighbouring Asian 
countries are threatened by its expanding economic influence.&nbsp; In Taiwan, 
many small suppliers have been affected as their local industrial customers 
have migrated to China. This case examines the experience of a small Taiwanese 
plastic injection company as it faces the challenges of global recession in 
early 2009.&nbsp; By developing a customized strategic plan using the Balanced 
Scorecard, some questions about its prospects are addressed and examined. Could 
Kuan Long Plastic Injection Inc continue to prosper and expand in the cost 
oriented plastic injection industry?</p>

<br> MCDONALD&#146;S: BACK TO THE MISSION <br>
<strong>Scott Stevens &amp; 
Rebecca Treadway</strong><strong>&nbsp;Maryville College</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case describes a company with unprecedented growth, which experienced 
losses in 2002, yet, rebounded in 2003 with an intentional new focus and 
strategy.&nbsp; In the last quarter of 2002, McDonald&rsquo;s experienced 
unfavorable same-restaurant sales, decreasing profit margins, and its first 
quarterly loss. Management implemented a strategic turnaround plan beginning in 
2003 to restore profitability.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>This case provides the opportunity for students to compare and contrast 
McDonald&rsquo;s old strategy, an aggressive growth strategy, with their new 
turnaround strategy, a mission-centered strategy.&nbsp; McDonald&rsquo;s 
turnaround strategy instituted the mission statement into core operations and 
focused on customer service. Students come to understand the prominence and 
pervasiveness the mission statement can have on company operations and on 
profitability. This case was developed for an undergraduate strategic 
management course and lends itself to discussion of the mission statement and 
its potential impact on strategic change.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>What began as a single streamlined hamburger restaurant in California grew 
to become one of the largest, most successful fast food chains across the 
globe. Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald&rsquo;s, made the brand into a 
household name.&nbsp; Yet in the late 1990&rsquo;s, market share dropped, and 
in 2002 the company hit a low point with its first reported loss.&nbsp; In 
2003, top management refocused the company on the principles that Kroc had 
founded the company on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Management implemented a number of 
strategic initiatives referred to as &ldquo;The Plan to Win.&rdquo; The 
strategy entailed reinstituting the mission into core operations. The focus was 
to reorient the company to better suit customers&rsquo; desires and to limit 
domestic growth.</p>

MYSTIC MONK COFFEE <br>

<strong>David L. Turnipseed &amp; John E. Gamble </strong><strong>University of 
South Alabama</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case is an ideal introduction to the tasks of crafting and executing 
strategy.&nbsp; The case is brief and the day-to-day life of the cloistered 
Carmelite monks should capture the interest of students.&nbsp; Instructors are 
able to use the case to introduce and illustrate the concepts of strategic 
visions, strategic and financial objectives, crafting strategy, strategy 
execution, business models, and the evolving nature of strategy.&nbsp; At the 
conclusion of the case, students should be able to offer recommendations to 
improve the monks&rsquo; approach to crafting and executing strategy.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>As Father Daniel Mary, the Prior of the Carmelite Order of monks in Clark, 
Wyoming walked to chapel to preside over Mass, he noticed the sun glistening 
across the 4-inch snowfall from the previous evening.&nbsp; Snow in June was 
not unheard of in Wyoming, but the late 2009 snowfall and the bright glow of 
the rising sun made him consider the opposing forces accompanying change and 
how he might best prepare his monastery to achieve his vision of creating a new 
Mount Carmel in the Rocky Mountains. His vision of transforming the small 
brotherhood of 13 monks crammed into a small home used as makeshift rectory 
into 500-acremonastery with accommodations for 30 monks, a retreat center for 
lay visitors, a Gothic church, a convent for Carmelite nuns, and a hermitage 
presented a formidable challenge.&nbsp; However, as a former high-school 
football player, boxer, and bull-rider, Father Prior Daniel Mary was 
unaccustomed to shrinking from a challenge. Father Prior had identified a 
nearby ranch for sale that met the requirements of his vision perfectly, but 
its current listing price of $8.9 million presented a financial obstacle to 
creating a place of prayer, worship, and solitude in the Rockies.&nbsp; The 
Carmelites had received a $250,000 donation that could be used toward the 
purchase and the monastery had earned nearly $75,000 during the first year of 
its coffee roasting operations, but more money would be needed.&nbsp; The 
coffee roaster used to produce packaged coffee sold to Catholic consumers at 
the Mystic Monk Coffee website could produce up to five times more coffee than 
what was sold in 2008.&nbsp; Also, local Cody, Wyoming business owners had 
begun a foundation for those wishing to donate to the monk&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; 
Father Prior Daniel Mary did not have a great deal of experience in business 
matters but considered to what extent the monastery could rely on its Mystic 
Monk Coffee operations to fund the purchase of the ranch.&nbsp; If Mystic Monk 
Coffee was capable of making the vision a reality, what were the next steps in 
turning the coffee into land?</p>

<strong>Jon Kalinowski, 
Timothy W. Scott, Paul L. Schumann,</strong><strong>John A. Kaliski &amp; 
Claudia H. Pragman</strong><strong>Minnesota State University Mankato</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case shows how a college faculty member and a 
business partner started one of the first eLearning system companies. The case 
follows the development of the business from start-up to a critical strategic 
decision. The case illustrates the challenges faced by typical start-up 
businesses. The company has never earned a profit. Losses are being covered by 
cash infusions by angel investors. While significant business opportunities are 
present, the company does not have the money to pursue all of them. 
Essentially, the case involves problems of growth, vision, potential, and 
management. The case was written for undergraduate or MBA courses in 
entrepreneurship or in strategic management.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
John Noble and Jack O&rsquo;Brien, who both worked for a 
university, founded Noble Systems in 1995 as one of the original companies to 
develop and market eLearning systems for the higher education market. The 
company grew to 35&ndash;40 university accounts (including several of the 
largest university systems in the country), 12&ndash;15 employees, and revenues 
of $354,000 in the first half of 2001. As Noble Systems grew, John and Jack 
faced many challenges: expenses exceeding revenues, cash flow problems, 
customer support difficulties, in-house management coordination problems, rapid 
technological change, emergence of strong competitors, a sales process to 
universities that was slow and frustrating, and a lack of partnerships with 
textbook publishers.&nbsp;In the Summer of 2001, Noble Systems has reached a 
critical decision point. The competitors in the higher education market have 
developed better financing, marketing, and partnerships with textbook 
publishers, which Noble Systems has not been able to match. Noble Systems has 
tested the waters outside of higher education by making a sale to a major 
insurance corporation to use Noble&rsquo;s eLearning system for corporate 
training. While corporate training markets are attractive for their huge sales 
potentials, John and Jack do not understand these markets as well as they 
understand higher education. The decision they face in Summer 2001 is: Where 
will they get their future business? Higher education? Corporate training? Can 
they raise the capital to do both? Can they find partners? Should they sell the 
business?</p> The authors developed the case for class discussion rather than

OLIVER WINERY &#150; EXPERIENTIAL MANAGEMENT &amp; GROWTH <br>
<strong>Allyson 
R. Baughman, Alexandra B. Schroeder &amp; Dean M. Schroeder</strong><strong>
Valparaiso University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case illustrates a company whose business model involves providing 
customers with a wine experience in its tasting room and vineyard that will 
then help to pull wine sales through wholesale channels. The southern Indiana 
company, Oliver Winery, has incorporated a mix of corporate culture, customer 
experience, and a broad product focus in this effort. These elements make for 
an interesting example of the company's unique culture and approach have 
successfully driven growth. It also raises questions about whether new avenues 
should be explored when facing unprecedented growth challenges.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Oliver Winery is a southern Indiana company that has 
taken a values-based approach to business and reaped the benefits in becoming 
the single largest Indiana winery with sales just under $15 million and a wine 
selection that sells in states such as (name states here) and is the home of 
the largest selling wine in both the states of Indiana and Kentucky. Oliver 
Winery focuses on providing employees with empowerment to take ownership of the 
company, customers with a memorable experience that will grant even 
inexperienced wine drinkers access to wine enjoyment and quality highly 
drinkable wine that can be enjoyed by a wide range of palates. The 
company&rsquo;s experiential offering merges idyllic landscaping, an 
artistically designed tasting room staffed with helpful servers and winery tour 
guides eager to share the story and legends of Oliver, a selection of gourmet 
foods, and a very wide selection of excellent wines. Through this offering, the 
company provides visitors with an exceptional winery experience, memories of 
which are revisited when they choose Oliver Wines to share with friends at 
home. Customers become ambassadors, as well as a part of an extended corporate 
culture. They spread the Oliver story and request Oliver wines from local 
vendors, helping to pull the company's product through the supply chain into 
their own communities.&nbsp;As Oliver has continued to grow and succeed over 
the years it has remained a solid organization that has relied upon its 
business model and value proposition to remain stable and successful. Now 
Oliver is entering a new phase of growth and has choices ahead of it in order 
to determine the future success and corporate culture of the company. These 
choices may challenge the very business model that has made the company so 
successful.</p> The authors developed the case for class discussion rather than

RAVENT&Oacute;S I BLANC AT A CROSSROADS <br>
<strong>Josep Franch, 
Xavier Gimbert &amp; Josep Llu&iacute;s Cano</strong><strong>ESADE Business 
School</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;Ravent&oacute;s i Blanc at a Crossroads&rdquo; case study was 
designed to be used in a Strategy (or Competitive Strategy) course and/or in an 
International (or Global Marketing) course. It is, however, recommended for 
advanced rather than basic or introductory courses. The case demands the 
application and discussion of a significant number of aspects and interrelated 
strategic dimensions, such as competitive advantage, product concept, market 
segmentation, positioning, distribution channel management, strategic alliances 
and growth strategies, as well as other strategic aspects specific to the 
sector being dealt. It requires decisions to be made regarding the analysis and 
selection of markets that the company could focus on, as well as alternative 
strategies to enter foreign markets.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Josep Ravent&oacute;s i Vidal, General Manager of Ravent&oacute;s i Blanc, 
stood at a crossroads. His father and his grandfather had founded 
Ravent&oacute;s i Blanc more than 20 years ago. After the difficult early years 
setting up the business, and a second phase of company consolidation, the 
moment seemed to have arrived for decisions that would have far-reaching 
consequences for the future of the company.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>Ravent&oacute;s i Blanc produced wines and &lsquo;cava&rsquo; &ndash;the 
name given to a sparkling wine produced using the Champagne or 
&lsquo;traditional&rsquo; Method in certain winemaking regions of Spain. From 
the outset, Ravent&oacute;s i Blanc&rsquo;s vision was to be the benchmark for 
premium cavas and wines, emphasising the quality of its strong viticultural 
roots, which meant it could produce high quality wines and cavas with grapes 
exclusively from its own vineyards. The Ravent&oacute;s family&rsquo;s long 
history and experience, and its integration of land, vineyard, wine and 
cellars, gave its products their own unique character. In 2008, the company had 
a sales turnover of &euro;5 million and sales exceeding 900,000 bottles, with 
exports representing 14% of them.</p>

THE TALBOTS, INC., 2008 <br>
<strong>
Maureen LaPorte (student) &amp; Mary Kay Sullivan</strong><strong>&nbsp;
Maryville College</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>In its early years The Talbots, Inc., had successfully differentiated 
itself as a purveyor of traditional women&rsquo;s clothing.&nbsp; But in 2008, 
the company is struggling financially and trying to re-establish its focus.
&nbsp;The case lends itself well to issues of market segmentation and to 
evaluation of strategies for expansion.&nbsp; The company&rsquo;s expansion 
into men&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s wear provides an example of straying from 
the perceived target market with dire results. Also, the rapid expansion 
(opening 50 new stores in 2007) could be used in a discussion of sustainable 
growth.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case is well suited for an in-depth analysis of the retail apparel 
industry and its general environment. The acquisition of the retail chain, J. 
Jill, offers opportunities to assess the merits of acquisitions that result in 
a significant debt burden. Has J. Jill contributed to the overall corporate 
strategy?</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The Talbots, Inc., a retailer of women&rsquo;s classic apparel and 
accessories since 1947, had a clear target market in the 35-year-and over age 
group. Its core customers tended to be professional women for whom tailored 
business wear was important.&nbsp; But by 2006, Talbots seemed to have lost its 
focus and was encountering serious financial problems. Sales had declined 
dramatically, with the company&rsquo;s clothing designs viewed as dowdy and out 
of touch with customer needs. Also, Talbots had been rapidly expanding 
geographically and expanding into men&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s wear.&nbsp; 
The acquisition of J. Jill left the company burdened with considerable debt. A 
new CEO, Trudy Sullivan, came to the helm in 2007 and developed plans for a 
turnaround.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> &nbsp; 
<p>In 2008, as Sullivan tried to implement a new strategy, economic recession 
hit retailers hard. Talbots was still struggling to find its niche.&nbsp; It 
had strayed from its original base and felt a need to return to its roots.&nbsp;
But the environment around it had changed and its competitors were turning to 
more contemporary designer styles.&nbsp; Talbots needed to establish a 
distinctive competence.&nbsp; What could the company do?</p>

ALICIA MENECES: APRENDIENDO DE AGUABLANCA 
<br> <strong>Luz-Dinora Vera Acevedo (student) &amp; Emmanuel Raufflet </strong>
<strong>HEC Montr&eacute;al</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
Alicia es una mujer con experiencia en los barrios 
pobres y con vivencia directa de los procesos cotidianos de movilizaci&oacute;n 
comunitaria en relaci&oacute;n al microcr&eacute;dito en comunidades 
desfavorecidas. La participaci&oacute;n de Alicia en el Simposio internacional:
<em>&ldquo;Microfinanzas y Construcci&oacute;n de Paz&rdquo;,</em> realizado en 
Cali-Colombia, donde participan m&aacute;s de 70 expertos nacionales e 
internacionales en microfinanzas, es crucial para las decisiones que se toman 
en este simposio. Alicia piensa en el mensaje que transmitir&aacute; al 
p&uacute;blico del simposio, el cual es ajeno a la realidad del 
microcr&eacute;dito de las comunidades pobres del pa&iacute;s. Con este caso se 
pretende exponer la dimensi&oacute;n institucional de la pobreza vs. Las 
definiciones econ&oacute;micas m&aacute;s tradicionales de la pobreza; 
as&iacute; mismo, se busca ilustrar el potencial y las limitaciones del 
microcr&eacute;dito para hacer frente a la pobreza; finalmente se explican las 
situaciones que caracterizan el liderazgo, el desarrollo de capacidades para la 
inserci&oacute;n en el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico y social y el coraje de una 
mujer que afronta los desaf&iacute;os de la pobreza en Aguablanca. Este caso se 
dirige a estudiantes de los cursos de desarrollo sostenible y estudiantes de 
gesti&oacute;n que trabajan aspectos de responsabilidad social en el MBA o a 
nivel de licenciatura.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Este caso presenta a Alicia Meneses l&iacute;der 
comunitaria desde hace 20 a&ntilde;os en el distrito de Aguablanca en 
Cali-Colombia. Alicia es ponente en el panel de inauguraci&oacute;n del

junto con el presidente del Banco interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), el 
presidente de la rep&uacute;blica y el presidente de la Corporaci&oacute;n 
Andina de Fomento (CAF). Alicia en este panel es la &uacute;nica mujer con 
experiencia pr&aacute;ctica en los procesos de microcr&eacute;dito para la 
poblaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s desfavorecida y con los mayores indicadores de 
violencia en el pa&iacute;s. En efecto, cerca de 400 pandillas operan 
principalmente en Aguablanca y Silo&eacute; y en el 2004 el 36% de los 
homicidios de pa&iacute;s ocurrieron en Aguablanca. Alicia victima del 
agiotismo del sistema informal del microcr&eacute;dito, puede darle un giro a 
la realidad de estas comunidades en el tema de microcr&eacute;dito. Este es el 
momento crucial en la vida de Alicia y la decisi&oacute;n que debe tomar al 
final del caso, se refiere al mensaje que ella pronunciar&aacute; en el panel 
de inauguraci&oacute;n. &iquest;C&oacute;mo y porqu&eacute; afrontar los

<p>Case Objective<br>
Este caso describe una situaci&oacute;n real de un 
Project Finance en Brasil: la construcci&oacute;n y posterior 
explotaci&oacute;n de una central hidroel&eacute;ctrica por un per&iacute;odo 
de treinta y cinco a&ntilde;os, con datos modificados para salvaguardar la 
confidencialidad. El proyecto se constituye como un servicio p&uacute;blico con 
alto impacto econ&oacute;mico y&nbsp; pol&iacute;tico, con una considerable 
inversi&oacute;n en un plazo de maduraci&oacute;n largo, y con posibles 
dificultades t&eacute;cnicas durante la construcci&oacute;n y posterior 
explotaci&oacute;n de la planta. En este tipo de proyectos, tanto los 
promotores como los bancos financiadores deben identificar y gestionar los 
diversos riesgos operativos, tecnol&oacute;gicos, econ&oacute;micos, 
financieros, pol&iacute;ticos, de suministro, regulatorios, etc, durante un 
largo per&iacute;odo temporal.&nbsp;El objetivo del caso es ilustrar los 
diversos aspectos que se deben considerar en&nbsp; este tipo de proyectos, con 
especial &eacute;nfasis en el an&aacute;lisis de la viabilidad y rentabilidad 
econ&oacute;mica y en la gesti&oacute;n de riesgos.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>En una calurosa tarde madrile&ntilde;a de agosto, Alberto G&oacute;mez 
ten&iacute;a cosas en que pensar. Como analista senior de riesgos en la entidad 
financiera para la que trabajaba, deb&iacute;a realizar un informe sobre la 
conveniencia de participar en el cr&eacute;dito sindicado para financiar el 
proyecto de la Central El&eacute;ctrica de San Francisco, en Brasil.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>En efecto, a finales de 2001, la Agencia Nacional de Energ&iacute;a 
El&eacute;ctrica (ANEEL), el organismo regulador del sector el&eacute;ctrico en 
Brasil, adjudic&oacute; a la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Energ&iacute;a de Brasil 
(EDB) la concesi&oacute;n para construir y operar una central 
hidroel&eacute;ctrica por un per&iacute;odo de treinta y cinco a&ntilde;os. La 
concesi&oacute;n daba derecho a utilizar los recursos naturales del r&iacute;o 
San Francisco, para lo cual se plane&oacute; construir una planta de 
energ&iacute;a hidroel&eacute;ctrica de 450 MW y una l&iacute;nea de 
transmisi&oacute;n de 50 km. de longitud que conectase la planta con la 
subestaci&oacute;n el&eacute;ctrica m&aacute;s cercana.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>El Sr. G&oacute;mez conoc&iacute;a el inter&eacute;s de su banco por 
participar en el proyecto, ya que durante el a&ntilde;o 2002 la 
situaci&oacute;n del mercado y la feroz competencia hab&iacute;an erosionado la 
rentabilidad de operaciones de inversi&oacute;n. Por otra parte, era consciente 
de los riesgos inherentes a un proyecto de este tipo.</p>

Guadalajara</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
El caso muestra c&oacute;mo Alfredo Ruiz, un mexicano 
nacido en la ciudad de Culiac&aacute;n Sinaloa,&nbsp; decide comprar un terreno 
para dedicarse a producir vino en la conocida regi&oacute;n de Burdeos en 
Francia a pesar de las transformaciones sufridas en esta competida industria. 
Nuevos pa&iacute;ses productores de vino; Chile, Estados Unidos, Argentina y 
Australia entre otros han estrado al mercado ocupando importantes cuotas de 
mercado. Alfredo Ruiz se preguntaba<em>&ldquo;Qu&eacute; debo hacer para lograr 
que el vi&ntilde;edo sea competitivo y rentable&rdquo;</em>. Una pregunta 
estrat&eacute;gica que debe resolver antes de iniciar el pr&oacute;ximo ciclo 
comercial. El caso presenta el reto para un nuevo productor debe elegir entre 
seguir la tendencia de los nuevos productores (etiquetas simples, calidad 
medio, precio medio y bajo) o seguir con la tradicional producci&oacute;n 
francesa de alta calidad y precio relativamente m&aacute;s alto. El caso ha 
sido escrito para estudiantes de cursos de estrategia en los semestres 
avanzados en pregrado, y nivel medio de maestr&iacute;a en negocios&nbsp; <br>

</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Alfredo Ruiz era el co-propietario y presidente (CEO) de 
Ch&acirc;teau Fonchereau, un vi&ntilde;edo ubicado en la zona productora de 
vinos en Burdeos Francia.La propiedad se&nbsp; localizaba 15 km al este de la 
ciudad de Burdeos. Ch&acirc;teau Fonchereau, era una edificaci&oacute;n del 
siglo XV que ten&iacute;a 50 hect&aacute;reas de terreno, de las cuales 30 eran 
vi&ntilde;edos. La propiedad fueadquirida en 2.5 millones de euros en el 
a&ntilde;o 2005.&nbsp; Dos a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s comenz&oacute; a producir 
35 mil botellas anuales de vinos&nbsp;tintos, blancos y espumosos. Un poco 
m&aacute;s tarde la casa ya contaba con una capacidad de producci&oacute;n de 
160 mil botellas, algunos de sus vinos fueron premiados en concursos 
internacionales.&nbsp;En octubre del a&ntilde;o 2008, Alfredo Ruiz 
cumplir&iacute;a tres a&ntilde;os y 10 meses de ser el primer y &uacute;nico 
productor latino en la zona y con la alegr&iacute;a de ver su sue&ntilde;o 
hecho realidad, poseer y operar un vi&ntilde;edo en Francia, reflexionaba: 
&ldquo;<em>En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os el mercado del vino ha cambiado y 
se ha vuelto muy competido. Los nuevos pa&iacute;ses productores como Australia 
presentan un amenazante crecimiento a&ntilde;o con a&ntilde;o</em>&rdquo;. Las 
ventas para el siguiente a&ntilde;o hab&iacute;an comenzado y Alfredo 
necesitaba definir a qu&eacute; mercado deb&iacute;a enfocarse en el corto 
plazo y con qu&eacute; estrategia. &ldquo;&iquest;<em>C&oacute;mo puedo ser 
competitivo en esta industria? Con la econom&iacute;a global en crisis, la 
estrategia ser&aacute; decisiva para permitir la permanencia y 
consolidaci&oacute;n de Ch&acirc;teau Fonchereau en el mercado y comenzar a ser 
redituable el pr&oacute;ximo a&ntilde;o</em>&rdquo; reflexionaba.</p> The

GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE IN CATALAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES <br>
<strong>
Josep Llu&iacute;s Cano, Josep Franch &amp; Miquel Novell</strong><strong>ESADE 
Business School</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case puts forward the use of Business Intelligence by a public body, 
the DURSI, which is the public body responsible for allocating budgets to 
public universities in Catalonia. The case shows the various stages involved in 
such a project and the difficulties that are faced until the final decision is 
taken. The case represents a great opportunity to assess the factors to be 
taken into consideration when undertaking a project of these characteristics, 
and to analyse the strategic complexity of adopting a solution of this type in 
a public-sector environment.<br>
<br>
The &lsquo;Government Intelligence in 
Catalan Public Universities&rsquo; case was designed to be used on Business 
Intelligence or Management Information Systems courses, as well as on general 
Information Systems courses.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The &lsquo;Government Intelligence in Catalan Public Universities&rsquo; 
case presents how Business Intelligence is applied within a public 
administration body, specifically the DURSI (Department of Universities, 
Research and Information Society, in the original Catalan<em>Departament 
d&rsquo;Universitats, Recerca i Societat de la Informaci&oacute;</em>) 
belonging to the Government of Catalonia (Spain).<br>
<br>
The case presents 
the changes that have been produced in the university system, the changes 
within the Catalan university system, the organisational structure that was 
used, the various stakeholders&rsquo; need to obtain decision-making 
information and how the project was carried out. The case concerns the adoption 
and implementation of Business Intelligence and the evolution of the system 
introduced by the DURSI with the aim of establishing a more equitable 
distribution model for financing public universities. The case shows the 
evolution in the use of Business Intelligence, and puts to those responsible 
for the new DIUE (formerly known as DURSI) the issue of evaluating the project 
that has been undertaken in addition to proposing its future development.<br>

<br>The protagonist of the case, Eudald Mestres, has recently joined the DIUE 
and should, in addition, offer support to Catalan public universities in terms 
of implementing the Bologna Plan, with the economic pressures that this implies.

LA NUEVA FORMA DE VIAJAR. LAN PER&Uacute; S.A. <br>

<strong>Jos&eacute; Garrido-Lecca, Universidad de Piura</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
El caso expone la situaci&oacute;n de Lan Per&uacute;, 
en un contexto en el cual la empresa lideraba el sector, con un crecimiento 
sostenido y con m&aacute;rgenes muy por encima del promedio; aunque 
participando de un mercado con la m&aacute;s baja penetraci&oacute;n de la 
regi&oacute;n. En este escenario, la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a se cuestiona como 
lograr un crecimiento sostenido, teniendo en cuenta que su principal competidor 
era el servicio exclusivo ofrecido por empresas de transporte terrestre. El 
caso nos llevar&aacute; a analizar desde una visi&oacute;n antropol&oacute;gica 
el comportamiento de la persona, usuaria y no usuaria del servicio 
a&eacute;reo, el an&aacute;lisis de toda la cadena de valor, pol&iacute;tica de 
precios, redise&ntilde;o de canales y revisi&oacute;n de la estrategia en su 
conjunto (modelo comercial y operativo) para dar coherencia a una serie de 
acciones orientadas a permitir el acceso de nuevas personas al servicio de 
transporte a&eacute;reo.&nbsp; El caso ha sido escrito para ser utilizado en 
programas de direcci&oacute;n de empresas en los t&oacute;picos de estrategia 
de negocios, antropolog&iacute;a del consumidor, estrategia de canales y 
propuesta de valor.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Manuel Van Oordt era el Gerente Central de Ventas y 
Marketing de Lan Per&uacute; S.A. , empresa que hab&iacute;a iniciado 
operaciones en el Per&uacute; en el a&ntilde;o 1999, aunque ya ven&iacute;a 
operando en Chile, pa&iacute;s de origen, desde el a&ntilde;o 30.&nbsp; Para el 
a&ntilde;o 2006, Manuel y el equipo comercial en su conjunto se cuestionan el 
modelo de negocio, buscando romper paradigmas que les permitiera lograr una 
mayor penetraci&oacute;n del servicio a&eacute;reo. La demanda de pasajes 
a&eacute;reos era el&aacute;stica, por lo que era preciso tener una 
pol&iacute;tica de menores precios para lograr el crecimiento del sector. Sin 
embargo, el modelo de negocio de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a hacia inviable 
ofrecer precios m&aacute;s baratos, mas a&uacute;n en una coyuntura en la que 
el precio del petr&oacute;leo presentaba una tendencia al alza. Por otro lado, 
era preciso revisar el comportamiento y motivaciones de la persona que viajaba 
en el pa&iacute;s, dado que por ejemplo se ten&iacute;a que el principal motivo 
de viaje por avi&oacute;n era por trabajo o negocios, en contraste con el total 
de la poblaci&oacute;n que viajaba principalmente a visitar familiares y por 
bus.&nbsp;El an&aacute;lisis y desarrollo del caso nos llevar&aacute; a 
plantearnos como llegar al potencial usuario del servicio a&eacute;reo y por 
ende a cuestionarnos el rol de las agencias de viaje. &iquest;Las agencias de 
viaje podr&iacute;an ayudar a que Lan Per&uacute; llegara a quien 
tradicionalmente no usaba el servicio a&eacute;reo?, &iquest;era posible 
transferir un menor precio al usuario final y gestionar la demanda bajo el 
modelo comercial tradicional?&nbsp; </p> The author developed the case for

LAS PREOCUPACIONES DE JUAN ANTONIO FERNANDEZ <br>

<p><strong>Gabriel Noussan</strong></p>
<p><strong>IAE Business School</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
Este caso permite comprender importancia que tiene 
realizar una adecuada planificaci&oacute;n de las finanzas personales y 
familiares. Adem&aacute;s de brindar la oportunidad de reflexionar sobre los 
elementos clave de la planificaci&oacute;n financiera personal posibilita una 
introducci&oacute;n en el funcionamiento de los mercados de capitales y los 
diversos veh&iacute;culos de inversi&oacute;n. Lo interesante es que esto 
&uacute;ltimo se produce desde la &oacute;ptica del inversor (en este caso el 
estudiante) lo que genera un aprendizaje &ldquo;interesado&rdquo; por parte de 
este &uacute;ltimo. El uso de este caso persigue tres objetivos diferentes: 1) 
El primer objetivo es que los directivos de empresa puedan lograr comprender y 
valorar la importancia que tiene la planificaci&oacute;n anticipada de sus 
finanzas personales y familiares. Esto que es algo normal en directivos 
anglosajones es, sin embargo, un elemento muy descuidado por parte de sus pares 
latinoamericanos. 2) El Segundo objetivo es lograr el inter&eacute;s en los 
cursos de finanzas, por parte de los directivos que participan en programas de 
Management general. El tratamiento del caso hace evidente la necesidad de 
contar con una comprensi&oacute;n b&aacute;sica del funcionamiento de los 
mercados de capitales y de los diversos instrumentos de inversi&oacute;n, por 
lo cual se convierte en un elemento inspirador del aprendizaje de Finanzas. 
Esto puede resultar muy importante para el desarrollo de capacidades 
b&aacute;sicas de an&aacute;lisis econ&oacute;mico y financiero, en muchos 
directivos que por formaci&oacute;n o vocaci&oacute;n no tienen una 
inclinaci&oacute;n o predilecci&oacute;n natural por estos temas. 3) El tercer 
objetivo es introducir los elementos b&aacute;sicos de los mercados de 
capitales y los instrumentos financieros disponibles para el inversor. El caso 
ha sido preparado especialmente para ser usado en la primera sesi&oacute;n de 
los cursos de finanzas de programas de Management general dirigidos a 
directivos a cargo de gerencias funcionales de compa&ntilde;&iacute;as. Es un 
caso que permite una introducci&oacute;n sencilla e interesada de los 
participantes en los elementos b&aacute;sicos de las inversiones financieras, 
por lo cual no se requiere un extensivo conocimiento previo de finanzas por 
parte de los estudiantes.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
El caso describe un encuentro de 4 directivos de empresa 
que, aunque fueron compa&ntilde;eros de estudios y grandes amigos, por razones 
de trabajo no se ven desde hace unos cuantos a&ntilde;os. La reuni&oacute;n 
hace que Juan Antonio Fern&aacute;ndez se de cuenta que a 20 a&ntilde;os de su 
edad de retiro no tiene un adecuado planteo de sus finanzas para dicho momento. 
El muestra las diferentes formas en que estos directivos han planteado sus 
objetivos al retiro y como est&aacute;n gestionando sus inversiones personales 
para lograr conseguirlos. La pregunta es &iquest;podr&aacute; Juan Antonio 
lograr una planificaci&oacute;n que en unos pocos a&ntilde;os le permita tener 
un retiro satisfactorio?</p> The author developed the case for class discussion 
rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of the 
situation.&nbsp; The case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and synopsis were 
anonymously peer reviewed and accepted by the North American Case Research

<p>Case Objective<br>
El caso muestra a una empresa multinacional, 
&ldquo;Telef&oacute;nica&rdquo;, en su estrategia de diversificaci&oacute;n de 
producto.&nbsp; En particular la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a se enfrenta al 
desaf&iacute;o de ingresar al mercado de la televisi&oacute;n de pago. 
&iquest;Deber&aacute; Telef&oacute;nica, con una casa matriz en Espa&ntilde;a, 
ingresar al mercado de Televisi&oacute;n de pago en Chile?. &iquest;Posee la 
compa&ntilde;&iacute;a los recursos y capacidades para competir en ese mercado? 
&iquest;C&oacute;mo reaccionar&aacute;n los competidores?.&nbsp; Estos son 
temas estrat&eacute;gicos, tanto del punto de vista corporativo como de la 
estrategia din&aacute;mica.&nbsp; El caso muestra tambi&eacute;n el efecto que 
tubo la decisi&oacute;n de Telef&oacute;nica Chile de entrar al mercado de la 
televisi&oacute;n de pago, sobre los diferentes actores, tanto de la industria 
de Telecomunicaciones como de la industria de Televisi&oacute;n de Pago.&nbsp; 
Dado los buenos resultados obtenidos por la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a y el nuevo 
escenario competitivo, se deja abierto al an&aacute;lisis del estudiante cual 
debiera ser la estrategia a seguir por Telef&oacute;nica para mantener o 
mejorar su posici&oacute;n competitiva.El caso es un excelente veh&iacute;culo 
para exponer a los alumnos de programas de MBA en el an&aacute;lisis y toma de 
decisiones en mercados muy din&aacute;micos y con gran tendencia a la 
convergencia tecnol&oacute;gica.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
En junio del a&ntilde;o 2006, Telef&oacute;nica Chile 
entr&oacute; al mercado de la televisi&oacute;n con su nuevo producto 
denominado &ldquo;Telef&oacute;nica Tv Digital&rdquo;. En ese momento, el 
mercado de la Televisi&oacute;n de Pago estaba dominado por un competidor, VTR, 
qui&eacute;n ofrec&iacute;a un &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; de productos 
(Telefon&iacute;a Fija, Internet de Banda Ancha y Televisi&oacute;n de Pago) lo 
cual era altamente valorado por los clientes. Esto le permiti&oacute; alcanzar 
una participaci&oacute;n en el mercado de la Televisi&oacute;n de Pago de un 
84% en el 2005. Telef&oacute;nica Chile&nbsp; pensaba que con este lanzamiento 
podr&iacute;a igualar la oferta de productos de su principal competidor y con 
ello, diversificar su negocio ingresando a una nueva industria. Este hito 
gener&oacute; un cambio en el mercado de la Televisi&oacute;n de Pago tanto en 
la forma de competir de los participantes como en las ofertas y promociones 
realizadas hasta ese momento. Frente a este nuevo escenario competitivo, 
Jos&eacute; Mol&eacute;s, Gerente General de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a y su 
equipo directivo, se preguntaba &iquest;Cu&aacute;l deber&iacute;a ser el 
siguiente paso para Telef&oacute;nica Chile? &iquest;C&oacute;mo deber&iacute;a 
competir en estas nuevas condiciones? y &iquest;C&oacute;mo podr&iacute;a 
aumentar la rentabilidad de la empresa y consolidar su posici&oacute;n 
competitiva?</p> The author developed the case for class discussion rather than

A RESEARCH-BASED PRE-PRACTICUM MODEL: IT SEEMED SO 
PROMISING&#133; <br>
<strong>Margaret Bouchard &amp; Audrey Wright</strong> 
<p><strong>Worcester State College</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case was developed primarily to use with higher 
education faculty and K-12 administrators and teachers who partner as part of 
the Professional Development Schools model.&nbsp; This case specifically 
focuses on the pre-practicum experience and how despite efforts and a spirit of 
collaboration, there can be a disconnection of theory to practice. The purpose 
of the case is to provide a discussion about the many reasons that a planned, 
research-based pre-practicum experience may fail to provide the rich meaningful 
experience that partners had intended and how to better plan and design 
effective experiences for pre-service teachers and K-12 staff, as well.<br>
</p>
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Dr. Venice was initially very excited about the pre-practicum experience 
for her reading method&rsquo;s students.&nbsp; She had planned it in 
cooperation with the elementary partnership or Professional Development School 
(PDS). The model was carefully researched to ensure a quality field experience 
that connected and deepened students&rsquo; knowledge and application of 
reading pedagogy, as well as, teacher reflection.&nbsp; However, despite her 
efforts and what seemed like a collaborative spirit on the part of the PDS, a 
few weeks into the semester, students&rsquo; reflections and cooperating 
teachers&rsquo; feedback indicated that all was not so promising. The 
college&rsquo;s Education Department Chair emails Dr. Venice that he wants to 
know if the model is succeeding and if Dr. Venice will be continuing the model 
for next semester. Should the pre-practicum model just be revised, relocated or 
abandoned?</p>

ANTI-SEMITISM IN FIRST YEAR COMPOSITION <br>
<strong>Matthew Levy 
&amp; Gerald M. Myers</strong><strong>Pacific Lutheran University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
<strong>The case is designed to stimulate discussion of 
an awkward situation in a first-year English composition class. A student has 
prepared an essay which contains language which could be interpreted as 
anti-Semitic. The instructor, who happens to be Jewish, is troubled by the 
discussion and wonders whether she could have handled the situation more 
effectively. The case addresses three major teaching objectives. The first is 
to identify ways to respond to students who exhibit a lack of awareness of the 
impact of their words on others. A second objective is to discuss ways to deal 
with awkward situations which arise in the classroom and to which a faculty 
response is required. Finally, the case addresses the issue of generating 
&ldquo;trust&rdquo; in discussion groups so that sensitive issues can be 
discussed without fear of reprisal or discrimination.</strong><br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Rachel Cohen, Assistant Professor English at Fairbanks University, has just 
completed a contentious meeting of her First Year Composition class, which had 
discussed a paper written by one of the students. Joe Anderson&rsquo;s paper 
contained statements that have been historically used as anti-Semitic slogans. 
Cohen attempted to avoid embarrassing Joe in front of others but felt she must 
address the issue directly. At the end of class, though, she wasn&rsquo;t sure 
that she had avoided embarrassing Joe or gotten through to him. What should she 
have done differently?</p>

TEACHERS AS LEADERS: MULTIPLE MODELS <br>

<strong>Cynthia Ingols, Simmons College School of Management</strong><strong>
Marue Walizer, Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
These six snapshots of exemplary high school teachers 
provide examples of how outstandingteachers are leaders. While conventional 
approaches to leadership may downplay the notion thatteachers must lead in 
their classrooms, these stories of exceptional teachers illustrate how they 
engage in all the behaviors of leaders. In<em>The Leadership Challenge, </em>
James Kouzes and Barry Posner have distilled through twenty-five years of 
research and writing the five fundamental practices of exemplary leaders. 
Juxtaposing Kouzes &amp; Posner's leadership model to theexemplary high school 
teachers' stories should convert skeptics to thinking that teachers need to
behave as leaders, both inside and out of classrooms. These snapshots may be 
used ineducational leadership courses and in workshops for second-stage 
teachers to challenge their thinking about their approach to professional 
development and to their careers.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
These stories portray six exceptional teachers who work 
in the public schools of New Jersey. While these teachers differ along 
demographic factors such as gender, race and ethnic background, they also 
exhibit remarkably similar behaviors in how they teach and lead in their 
schools. In particular, they serve as role models for their colleagues. They 
show remarkable compassion for less well off students and new colleagues. They 
challenge students to learn and apply themselves in interesting, creative and 
useful ways. They bring appropriate emotional timbre to their classrooms and 
interactions with students and colleagues. And, importantly, theyare clear 
about their values and how their values undergird their roles as teachers and 
educationalleaders. In short, these teachers provide multiple models of how to 
lead from the classroom.</p> The authors developed the case for class

<strong>Hugh Grove, Yuhua 
Hao &amp; Tom Cook, University of Denver</strong><strong>Tomas Casas Klett, 
University of St. Gallen</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case has several major objectives: </p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand the Chinese business 
environment and the Chinese software industry in order to do business in China.
</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To analyze various financial accounting 
adjustments and reclassifications in recasting the company&rsquo;s financial 
accounting system to international financial reporting standards (IFRS) for a 
possible initial public offering (IPO).</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To apply free cash flows and market 
multiples for business valuation purposes.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand various methods for 
calculating the international cost of capital.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To analyze various business valuation 
methods, foreign exchange risks, and deal structures in order to understand 
their impacts upon the key entrepreneurial decision (exit now or later?) and 
upon the net proceeds for the three partners.</p> This case is intended for 
senior undergraduate and advanced graduate courses in financial accounting and 
finance where financial statement recasting and business valuation topics are 
taught. <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This is a decision based case written from the point of view of the chief 
executive officer (CEO) who was attending the March 2008 Asia Pacific Partner 
Conference of a major U.S. software vendor.&nbsp; This CEO has just received a 
surprising and unsolicited offer from a Japanese company to purchase his AmData 
Software China company which owns the exclusive mainland China franchise to 
distribute this U.S. vendor&rsquo;s software.&nbsp; The Japanese company owns a 
similar exclusive franchise in Japan.&nbsp; After preliminary negotiations, 
including a demand by the Japanese company to state the business sale amount in 
U.S. dollars, the initial $2.5 million offer was raised to $5.5 million.&nbsp; 
However, this amount was not yet agreed to by both parties and a business 
valuation analysis would be critical to the key decision of the case:&nbsp; 
should the CEO sell the company now or continue to develop it for sale at a 
future date?&nbsp; Such a subsequent sale might be an IPO on one of the Chinese 
stock exchanges.</p>

CONSTELLATION: THE DISTRIBUTION OF MINIBONDS <br>
<strong>Hugh Thomas, The 
Chinese University of Hong Kong</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case places the students in the role of a commercial banker who must 
decide the appropriateness and method of distribute a complex structured 
finance product to retail bank customers.&nbsp; The case is best used in a 
banking course with students who are familiar with traditional commercial 
banking and banks&rsquo; expansion into retail wealth management services.&nbsp;
Through their analysis of this case, students learn the nature and pricing of 
credit default swaps, the structure of synthetic securitizations, how conflicts 
of interest may arise in retail banking and brokerage with unsophisticated 
customers and&nbsp; the obligations of a banker/investment advisor who in sells 
complex financial products.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Winston Kwok-keung Auyeung, Managing Director of Personal Banking for Bao 
An Bank of Hong Kong, has the opportunity to distribute<em>minibonds</em>, to 
his retail banking and wealth management customers.&nbsp; <em>Minibonds</em> 
are securities issued in a retail synthetic securitization, a structured 
investment using a special purpose vehicle which purchases riskless securities 
and issues credit default swaps.&nbsp; Each dollar of <em>minibond </em>issues 
eight dollars of seven year credit default swaps.&nbsp; Each credit default 
swap is a bet that a reference party will not default on its debt.&nbsp; The 
reference parties in the<em>minibonds</em> are highly respectable global banks 
and investment banks, whose probabilities of default individually are extremely 
low; however, the chance that at least one reference party will default in at 
least one year is substantial.&nbsp; This substantial risk is priced and the 
price allows the<em>minibonds</em> to offer attractive &ldquo;interest&rdquo; 
to investors.&nbsp; Winston Kwok must decide whether or not to distribute the 
<em>minibonds</em> to his customers, given that competitors are selling them 
and that customers appear to be comfortable with financial risk.&nbsp; In 
deciding the issue, Winston Kwok must consider not only matching the risk 
appetite of clients but also the ability of clients to understand the 
complexities of the minibonds.&nbsp; He must also confront the potential 
conflict of interest in distributing<em>minibonds</em> through his sales team, 
in view of the possible inability of clients to understand the difference 
between a bank deposit and a structured investment vehicle.&nbsp; To the extent 
that customers rely solely on the advice of his sales team to purchase 
investments which they do not understand, the bank may incur liability 
detrimental to its profitability and future reputation.</p>

DISTRIBUCIONES CANARIAS, S.A. (DISCASA) 
<br> <strong>Francisco J. L&oacute;pez Lubi&aacute;n, Instituto de Empresa 
Business School</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case study aims to illustrate the various factors 
that have to be taken into account to evaluate strategic alternatives from a 
financial point of view. More specifically, it describes in detail how to value 
a potential candidate to be acquired, including how the take-over is financed.
The case study offers an excellent opportunity to analyse the link between 
strategic decisions and their associated economic value. It also gives answer 
to questions like: Can we measure the value of a given strategy? Can we measure 
the value of expected synergies? How can we negotiate on the price in an 
acquisition operation?The case is aimed at post-graduate students on an 
advanced financial management course, as they address the topic of Mergers and 
Acquisitions. It could also be used in seminars on corporate finance or 
valuation.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In a rainy day of February 2008, Heriberto G&oacute;mez, General Manager 
and shareholder of&nbsp; Distribuciones Canarias, S.A. (Discasa) was trying to 
organize his ideas, develop arguments and draw conclusions to be able to defend 
his new and ambitious strategy for the company at the next meeting of the Board 
of Directors. While he stared at the rain beating down against his windowpane 
he tried to concentrate on the facts&hellip;</p> 
<p>This case study describes, from the point of view of the General Manager, 
the alternatives Discasa is facing in order to ensure its survival.</p>

NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY: THE COMPANY YOU KEEP&#61667; <br>
<strong>Mary 
Michel &amp; Janet L. Rovenpor</strong><strong>Manhattan College</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case describes the challenges facing the investment 
management team of the New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) during a 
weakening US economy. Chief Investment Officer, Gary Wendlandt, proposed that a 
larger percentage of investable cash flow be placed in US government securities 
instead of corporate securities than in previous years. Was a &ldquo;quality 
tilt&rdquo; program necessary? What would be its effects on the company&rsquo;s 
future earnings? The case is most appropriate for courses in Strategic 
Financial Management, Financial Statement Analysis, and Financial Instruments. 
The purpose of the case is to provide students with a better understanding of 
US life insurance companies and how they operate. In particular, the case will: 
(1) expose students to the types of investment decisions made by executives of 
life insurance companies and their consequences, (2) provide students with the 
tools to analyze the financial statements of life insurance companies (e.g., 
how to calculate loss ratios, expense ratios, and solvency ratios) and, (3) 
give students practice in industry and competitor analysis.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In February 2007, Gary Wendlandt, Chief Investment Officer of the NYLIC, 
was faced with an important decision.&nbsp; Emerging signals in the financial 
markets pointed towards an uncertain future. The US housing market was 
weakening at a time when financial institutions had significant assets tied up 
in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. Companies 
that had been taken private through leveraged buyouts were underperforming and 
could default on their loans. Investments, even in corporate bonds issued by 
large US businesses, were becoming risky.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The question before Wendlandt and his investment management team was 
whether or not to place more of NYLIC&rsquo;s investable cash flow into safer 
but lower yielding fixed income products. NYLIC had a responsibility to its 
policyholders. It was management&rsquo;s duty to protect the longevity and 
financial strength of the firm, so that it could continue to pay policyholder 
claims, distribute payments from annuities, and issue dividends. This required 
high levels of capital surplus. Wendlandt proposed to divert assets from 
corporate bonds to government bonds, even if it meant foregoing higher 
short-term returns. Was this an overly conservative strategy? What proportion, 
if any, of investable cash flow should be diverted?</p>

SURVEY 
RESEARCH ASSOCIATES <br>
<strong>Raymond H. Lopez, Pace University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case documents the career of an entrepreneur, Alfredo Sanchez from his 
Ph.D. in Geology (University of Madrid) to his ownership and pending sale of 
survey Research Associates upon his retirement.&nbsp; After being employed as a 
geologist for a few years, Alfredo and his family moved to Spain where he 
started a wholly owned subsidiary of his employer.&nbsp; Its mission was to 
analyze sand deposits for beach restoration for a number of countries bordering 
the Mediterranean Sea.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case involved two aspects of Mr. Sanchez&rsquo;s decision; what is the 
value of the firm and what type of compensation agreement will maximize his 
return on an investment of time and finances that spanned more than 40 years.
</p> &nbsp; 
<p>As a private company operated to maximize cash flows rather than reported 
net income, students have an opportunity to restructure the income statements 
and recalculate those cash flows.&nbsp; The concept of the 
&ldquo;entrepreneurial wage&rdquo; can be discussed as well as estimates of the 
cost of capital to be used for discounting purposes.&nbsp; The case has been 
written for MBA students in a capstone finance course.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>After his 12 years in Spain, Alfredo brought his family back to the United 
States and in a few a years, decided to set out on his own.&nbsp; He started 
SRA and developed valuable contacts in the Federal Government, State 
Governments and private companies.&nbsp; The firm grew steadily and provided a 
comfortable life style for the family.&nbsp; When his son, Steve, graduated 
from Williams College, Alfredo convinced him to come into the firm.&nbsp; 
Reluctantly he agreed and for more than a decade became an integral component 
of operating management as well as critical business strategic decisions. On a 
part time basis, he also directed two films and wrote a proposal for a TV 
sitcom.&nbsp; When it became evident that Steve did not desire to continue at 
SRA, a sale of the firm became the only viable alternative for the family.</p>

THE IPO OF FRAPORT <br>
<strong>Andreas 
Schueler,</strong><strong>Universit&auml;t der Bundeswehr Munich</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case study deals with discounted cash flow 
valuation for an initial public offering (IPO). Issues examined include the 
difficulties to be encountered while developing cash flow forecasts, the risk 
in using multiples for valuation and the advantages of using discounted cash 
flow methods, especially the APV (adjusted present value) method instead. The 
case suits first or second year graduate students, especially majors in 
Finance. It can be used in classes on Corporate Finance, Financial Management 
or Valuation. Its presentation takes about 90 minutes in class and 15 hours of 
preparation by students. The teaching objectives are: (1) identification of the 
information relevant for a cash flow forecast, (2) understanding the challenges 
in building up a cash flow forecast, (3) understanding the risks of using 
multiples and (4) using discounted cash flow valuation for a company which 
provides more challenges than a textbook problem. The case deepens the 
knowledge of students regarding valuation. Thus, it can be used for classroom 
discussion after the relevant chapters in standard textbooks like 
Ross/Westerfield/Jaffe/Jordan, Corporate Finance, or Brealey/Myers, Principles 
of Corporate Finance, have been discussed. Excel spreadsheets can (but do not 
have to) be distributed in order to structure the discussion.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
This case deals with the IPO of Fraport, especially the 
challenges while determining the issue price including the valuation itself but 
also the discussion with investment banks. It uses the perspectives of two 
managers of Fraport who are heading the IPO team and their external advisors. 
Data sources are the corporate plans of Fraport as used internally for 
preparing the IPO. Fraport allowed those real data to be used as a case study. 
An additional source of information was the issue prospectus.</p> The author

TRANSIT AUTHORITY OF NORTHERN KENTUCKY (TANK) 
VERSUS WILSON HOLDINGS, INC. <br>
<strong>Philip Glasgo &amp; Shelly Webb 
</strong><strong>Xavier University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case is designed to introduce finance students to similarities and 
differences between analyzing financial statements of&nbsp; for-profit 
corporations&nbsp; and not-for-profit&nbsp; quasi-governmental agencies using 
TANK, a regional bus service serving three counties in Northern Kentucky as the 
not-for profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also introduces the student to the topic of 
eminent domain, since TANK is trying to acquire a local business property in 
order to build a new bus terminal, and leads to a lively discussion of when 
eminent domain is appropriate and when it is not.&nbsp; Six years of historical 
financial data and two years of projected financial statements are presented to 
the reader.&nbsp; Some of the data appears similar to a for-profit corporation, 
but some is quite dissimilar. Because the three counties, federal, and state 
government share the expenses&nbsp; not covered by passenger revenues,&nbsp; 
assessing the financial condition of the organization requires the analyst to 
re-arrange the information into a format that is suitable for analysis using 
traditional financial tools.&nbsp; If eminent domain is invoked, how will TANK 
be able to pay for the land and improvements?&nbsp; What pressure will this 
place on the three counties&rsquo; own financial operations? The case is 
written primarily for undergraduate courses in finance, but could also be used 
in an introductory MBA class.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Mike is a recent college graduate hired as a financial analyst working for 
the Budget Director of Kenton County.&nbsp; If TANK&rsquo;s eminent domain suit 
is successful, the county, which has agreed to cover almost half of the annual 
operating deficit of the bus line, could face a substantial&nbsp; increase in 
contributions if the resulting project is not self-sustaining.&nbsp; Thus, an 
analysis of TANK&rsquo;s present financial situation and trends is essential.
&nbsp;But the financial statements have a lot of line items different from what 
Mike encountered&nbsp; in his finance classes.&nbsp; In order to do the 
analysis, he needs to first understand the differences, rearrange the 
statements so that they look similar to what he (and the county board of 
supervisors) are used to, and then analyze them and provide recommendations.
&nbsp;Finally, he needs to analyze the impact on Kenton County if TANK borrows 
over $7 million to fund the acquisition and thus incurs substantial principal 
and interest payments that were not in the previous budget or their pro-formas.

A LAND OF 
DREAMS <br>
<strong>Arthur Sharplin, Bentley College Center for Business Ethics
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case is centrally designed for use in a bio-ethics segment or class 
which is part of a pre-med or medical program.&nbsp; It may be of use in many 
other settings, including business ethics, strategic management, marketing 
ethics, and organizational behavior.&nbsp; The case discusses the travails of 
four brothers as they discover various conflicts within the medical system and 
their impact on the delivery of cardiovascular care.&nbsp; An important purpose 
is to help develop empathy for the plight of the Sharplins, as representative 
of others with cardiovascular concerns, and to develop a reasonable plan of 
action.&nbsp; Accomplishing this will inevitably involve a wide-ranging 
discussion of the current state of medical ethics in relation to cardiology 
and, metaphorically, other fields of medicine.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Four brothers from Louisiana, USA lost their father and two brothers to 
heart attacks at relatively early ages.&nbsp; So they have lived in 
anticipation, if not fear, of sudden death.&nbsp; All have taken usual measures 
to stave off heart disease.&nbsp; In 2007, a nephew had a coronary artery 
bypass and one of the four brothers suffered chest discomfort.&nbsp; At about

THE CASE OF THE NEW 
DOCTOR <br>
<strong>Michael Tansey, Rockhurst University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>When young doctors decide about the practice they want to establish, they 
are suddenly confronted with business problems that small businesses typically 
face.&nbsp; An MBA for medical students has been designed at Rockhurst 
University which starts students in their first summer with an integrated 
economics/accounting case which is solved by teams of up to four students.&nbsp;
The case requires proficiency in applying their accounting and economics; they 
must apply and interpret a fully dynamic EXCEL model of their practice that 
automatically makes ledger, balance sheet, cash flow statement and income 
statement compatible.&nbsp; The scenarios they examine with the model face them 
with the decision of what form of organization they wish to choose; a solo 
practice, a partnership, or a corporation.&nbsp; They also must choose what 
demographic communities, third party payers, price discounting and size of 
practice that would be most practical and profitable.&nbsp; However, in making 
the choices they must make tradeoffs in the quality of care and quality of life 
for themselves.&nbsp; The choices force them to explore the constraints and 
objectives of four kinds codes; (1) their professional code (eg. the 
Hippocratic oath), (2) their personal ethics and religion, (3) corporate social 
responsibility, and (4) the law (particularly antitrust law).</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Soper, a family practitioner, graduated from 
medical school and had to decide where to locate and what size of practice he 
wanted.&nbsp; He could work for a large corporation or set up his own practice.
&nbsp;Once he decided he wanted to set up his own practice he had to decide 
where.&nbsp; At first he started a solo practice in Liberty, Missouri, but 
after several years, even as he attained an MBA, he established a clinic. 
However, the running of the clinic involved a heavy management burden. 
Furthermore the clinic relied on the highly risky, limited base of a single 
institutional customer.&nbsp; Dr. Soper decided to sell the clinic, relocate to 
North Kansas City, and set up a new practice. When asked to address medical 
students about locating and sizing a practice, he realized there were many 
considerations that he would like to have thought through BEFORE he set up his 
practice.</p> 
<p></p> The case was developed as two assignments capped by a team final for 
an MBA Economics course for medical students in a joint medical degree-MBA 
program at Rockhurst University.&nbsp; The case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and 
synopsis were anonymously peer reviewed and accepted by the North American Case 
Research Association (NACRA) for its annual meeting, October 2009, Santa Cruz,

<br> USING BRIEF CASES TO TEACH HEALTH CARE ETHICS <br>
<strong>James E. 
Fisher, Saint Louis University<br>
Heidi R. Fisher, formerly of University of 
Pennsylvania</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>A series of brief health care ethics cases provide the basis for 
instructing undergraduate students in applied ethics. The cases originate from 
The Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl and are reproduced with the permission of the 
Association for Practical and Profession Ethics, which is the sponsor of this 
annual competition among undergraduate teams. This set of cases has been 
combined with a narrow purpose in mind, namely, to help prepare undergraduates 
for competition in the Ethics Bowl. It may also have a broader application in 
an introductory course in health care ethics or as a unit or module in a 
broader applied ethics course. The first author is himself a former 
&ldquo;coach&rdquo; of his university&rsquo;s Ethics Bowl team and the second 
author a former participant. The accompanying instructional materials seek to 
utilize the individual cases to introduce appropriate analytic categories and 
decision-making approaches especially suited to the field of health care 
ethics. Thus students are challenged to make connections across the individual 
cases and, where appropriate, to test the adequacy ethical theories, 
professional standards, public policy guidelines and personal values.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The emphasis in this selection of cases is breadth rather than depth. 
Collectively the cases represent a wide spectrum of health care issues: 
professional responsibility and its limitations, genetic testing and its 
application, end-of-life issues and the application of health care to the 
enhancement of human performance and appearance. For example, a registered 
nurse protests against an assignment to perform a procedure for a terminally 
ill patient. In another case, parents seek to use genetic engineering to 
produce a second child that will potentially provide bone marrow stem cells for 
the treatment of seriously ill first-born child. An Islamic family resists the 
counsel of medical professionals from a U.S. community hospital to remove their 
brain-dead relative from a ventilator. And a plastic surgeon, who performed a 
procedure on a patient when she was eleven-years-old, has reservations when 
faced with a subsequent request when she is seventeen. Other cases similarly 
challenge students think critically and draw the connection between thought and 
action.</p>

DR. ABDUL-AZIZ <br>
<strong>Nile Khanfar, 
Nova Southeastern University,Palm Beach Gardens</strong><strong>David Loudon, 
Samford University, Birmingham</strong><strong>Fadi Alkhateeb, University of 
Charleston</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This disguised case is a real situation used to provide 
undergraduate and graduate students with an opportunity to make practical 
application of sound management principles within a small pediatric medical 
practice.&nbsp; Students are given the opportunity to diagnose the various 
management issues facing the practice and to suggest possible solutions.&nbsp; 
The clinic is beset with problems of lack of supervision, failure to exert 
effective controls, lack of leadership, and conflicting personalities.&nbsp; 
Dr. Abdul-Aziz is considering separating from the group practice in which he is 
a partner and establishing his own independent practice in the same market.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is appropriate for students to develop alternative 
management strategies and provide Abdul-Aziz with a reasoned analysis for 
staying or moving to a new practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students should be encouraged 
to evaluate different scenarios related to the case.&nbsp; This case is 
suitable for written reports, oral presentations, and examination purposes.<br>

</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This case deals with an actual situation involving Dr. Abdul-Aziz (all 
names are disguised) who must make a decision about his future with the small 
group pediatric practice he is a partner with.&nbsp; Dr. Abdul-Aziz has been 
with the group for about five years, but has been disappointed in how the 
practice is managed.&nbsp; The lack of effective staff supervision has resulted 
in several significant problems.&nbsp; Physicians have established certain 
policies without informing other partners.&nbsp; Nurses and reception staff 
have been poorly supervised and as a result some have resorted to surfing the 
Internet instead of handling important office tasks.&nbsp; Improper supervision 
of filing has caused slowdown and embarrassment with patients.&nbsp; Billing 
carelessness and pricing inaccuracies have cost the partners hundreds of 
thousands of dollars over the last few years.&nbsp; With the growing patient 
base of Dr. Abdul-Aziz, he has the opportunity to leave with his patients and 
establish a new independent practice.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The case focuses on the decision of Abdul-Aziz to remain with the group and 
try to change people, philosophies, and procedures or to separate and establish 
a new practice where he can implement the professional systems with properly 
trained and supervised staff, guided by his own philosophy of service and 
medicine and unfettered by his current environment.</p>

MANAGING GROWTH AT BACKCOUNTRY.COM <br>

<strong>Markus Vodosek, University of Utah</strong><strong>Charla Brown, Devon 
Energy</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The main learning objective of this case is to 
understand how organizational culture caneffectively support a company&rsquo;s 
strategy, how organizational culture develops, and how it is maintained. 
Relevant management theories applicable to this case include Edgar 
Schein&rsquo;s (1992) conception of organizational culture and Ben 
Schneider&rsquo;s (1987, 1999) Attraction-Selection- Attrition framework for 
employee selection.This case was written for a class session on organizational 
culture in an introductoryorganizational behavior course and can be used in 
undergraduate, graduate, and executiveclasses. The case can also be used for an 
HR course in a class session on recruiting and selection. In a corporate 
strategy class, the case can demonstrate the importance of organizational 
culture in the support of an organization&rsquo;s business strategy. In an 
entrepreneurship class, the case can illustrate innovative ways to manage 
growth.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
This case portrays the rapid growth and unique culture of 
Backcountry.com, an online retailer of outdoor gear headquartered in Park City, 
Utah. The company was founded in 1996 by Jim Holland, an Olympic ski jumper, 
and John Bresee, an outdoor writer. At the time the case ends in July 2008, the 
company employed 500 people and had sales of $200 million. The year before, the 
company had been bought by Liberty Media, a large holding company of businesses 
like Expedia, Ticketmaster, and the QVC home-shopping network.Students are 
asked to assume the role of Charla Brown, Director of Human Resources at

PENINSULA WINES <br>
<strong>
Monica Draayer &amp; Mark Julien</strong><strong>Brock University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case shows the challenges a small business often has with the 
attraction and retention of a highly skilled position.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case 
illustrates the importance of this position and the potential loss of 
reputation that the winery could suffer should the turnover of winemakers 
continue.&nbsp; The case was written for business school undergraduate or MBA 
courses in recruitment and selection.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Oliver Peninsula, general manager of Peninsula wines, a winery operating in 
the Niagara Region of Ontario, had worked hard with his family to establish a 
reputable name for producing quality wines at their winery.&nbsp; Sitting at 
his desk, he faced critical decisions in terms of staffing.&nbsp; In less than 
four years of operation, the company had lost its first two winemakers to local 
competitors.&nbsp; It is widely accepted in the wine industry that a qualified 
winemaker is critical to the success of the winery.&nbsp; The job of winemaker 
is a highly skilled position requiring an individual with experience in the 
winemaking process, solid management skills, education in lab testing for 
sugar, acid and PH levels, physical strength to be deeply involved in every 
aspect of the winemaking process (e.g. stirring and cleaning barrels, bottling 
wine), knowledge of inventory management, strong interpersonal skills and 
someone who is detail oriented and self-motivated.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>Oliver knew he must determine how to ensure that they retain their current 
winemaker, Don Milan, who has worked for Peninsula for less than a year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver was happy with the performance of Don and his associate 
winemaker, Carl Dore, and felt that they fit well with the culture of the 
family run winery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver knew that both the quality of their wines 
and the consistency in their styles were critical to the company&rsquo;s 
ongoing success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsula had received comments from customers 
that the taste and style of their wines were different from year to year, which 
Oliver knew was a result of the different winemakers they have employed in such 
a short period of time.&nbsp; He believed that the inconsistency of their wines 
was starting to negatively affect sales.</p>

SHENZHEN FILTROIL: FINDING BALANCE <br>

<strong>Gerry Yemen &amp; Lynn Isabella</strong><strong>Darden School of 
Business University of Virginia</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case can be used to exemplify the challenges of changing a U.S.-based 
company into a global competitor. Issues that are discussed include: 
cross-cultural relations, global effectiveness, global entrepreneurship, human 
resources, leadership, organizational development, and business strategy. The 
material could be used to focus on what it takes to build effective working 
relationships, allowing students to explore issues including dealing with 
conflict, building trust, managing performance, and having difficult 
conversations in a global context.</p> &nbsp; The case is suitable for use in 
organizational behavior, human resource management, and strategy classes at the 
MBA and executive education levels. The case could be taught near the end of a 
term to serve as a review of managing stakeholders; it could also be taught at 
the close of a global leadership module focusing on issues of managing across 
cultural differences,individual behavior, and teams, experiencing issues that 
confront global managers, developing management skills and style, leading 
negotiations, and recognizing personal leadership models. <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Jeremy Leahman, president of Filtroil, Inc., and Albert Randolph, founder 
of the firm, had created a partnership with a supplier in China to ramp up the 
manufacture of their China-based filtration system and start a new zinc alloy 
venture. They opened a new factory in Dongwan that was a merger between 
Shenzhen Filtroil and their supplier, Liu Li&mdash;whose own factory was on the 
verge of bankruptcy. Liu would own 10% of the merged factory and Shenzhen 
Filtroil would own the rest and acquire all of the necessary equipment. The two 
businesses filter and zinc would operate under the same roof.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>One year later Leahman was on a plane headed for China to hash out problems 
with Liu, who had demanded a monthly raise for himself and his wife, a new 
company car, and an increase in profit sharing. He had also threatened to delay 
product shipment to the United States if his conditions were left unmet. Qian 
Kai Nam (Qian) and Shea Kai Young (Thomas), who ran Shenzhen Filtroil and were 
in on the zinc partnership, believed that Liu&rsquo;s behavior put the entire 
business relationship at risk. The case reveals options Leahman could take to 
manage the situation.</p>

SODEXO CANADA <br>
<strong>Cathy 
McCann &amp; Mark Julien</strong><strong>Brock University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case shows the frustration on the part of a dedicated group of 
operations and human resource professionals who feel that despite their best 
efforts that they risk not successfully filling upcoming vacancies.&nbsp; 
Sodexo has attempted to position itself as an employer of choice, has used a 
variety of recruitment channels and offer benefits and career development 
potential.&nbsp; The key issue involves how Sodexo can overcome several key 
barriers in order to successfully recruit.&nbsp; The case was written for 
business school undergraduate or MBA courses in recruitment and selection.</p> 
<br> 
<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Resources department for assistance with the recruitment and selection of 
hourly personnel for their food service operations within the Ontario Power 
Generation (OPG) plant facilities.&nbsp; Greg knew that his team was anxious 
about the prospect of hiring more food service workers in order to deal with 
the anticipated increase in the number of customers served.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a 
recruitment initiative would be challenging given the perception that all 
possible recruitment channels had already been explored.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The frustration experienced by Greg&rsquo;s team centers on the perception 
that despite performing an admirable job of trying to fill the position that 
there are key barriers outside the control of the team.&nbsp; First and 
foremost is the daunting security screening process.&nbsp; Because the 
positions are located in a nuclear power plant, there is a multi-stepped 
Federal security clearance required.&nbsp; The length of time required to get 
the clearance (i.e. 6-8 weeks) often results in candidates being hired by 
Sodexo and then subsequently quitting before their first shift in order to seek 
employment elsewhere.&nbsp; Other challenges include the remote location of the 
facility and the lack of public transportation options, the amount of 
subsequent training required by OPG and the perception that all current 
recruitment channels have been attempted and exhausted.&nbsp; The pressure is 
on to fill the positions because the OPG plants are about to experience a large 
increase in the number of contractors who perform yearly maintenance on the 
plants.&nbsp; The extra people in the plant will result in more foot traffic at 
Sodexo&rsquo;s food service facilities at OPG and therefore, Sodexo must hire 
additional staff without compromising the integrity of the client&rsquo;s 
strict security process.</p>

THE CENTER MORICHES SCHOOL BOARD (A) &amp; (B) 
<br> <strong>Stuart Rosenberg, Dowling College School of Business</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case enables students to study the evolution of a school board during a 
period of crisis as well as in the period after the crisis has passed. With 
this evolution, the organization dynamics of the personalities on the board 
come into focus, allowing students to analyze the sources of power of the board 
president and the leadership role that he has employed. The case was developed 
for undergraduate courses in Organization Behavior as a means to apply many of 
the theories associated within that field of study.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This case follows the development of the Center Moriches School Board, 
based on the events that shaped that development. The (A) case traces the 
events leading up to May 2004, when the residents of this Long Island community 
discovered that the school budget that they were voting on would result in a 
significant increase in property tax rates. The increase in property taxes was 
necessary due in large part to the mismanagement of the school district by its 
superintendent of schools, who, by the time that the fiscal crisis became 
widely known, had disappeared from public view. As a consequence, it was left 
to the school board, and its charismatic president, Joe McHeffey, to determine 
how to proceed with the school budget in the face of a hostile community.</p> 
&nbsp; 
<p>The (B) case is set in November 2006. In the two and a half years that 
elapsed since the (A) case, the Center Moriches School Board had succeeded in 
restoring the faith of the community in its management of the school district. 
The board went ahead with the 2004 school budget vote (which was approved), and 
the community voted in favor of both the 2005 and 2006 school budgets, 
reaffirming its belief in the school board. A new superintendent of schools had 
been hired and the academic performance within the school district showed 
progress. The school board, however, still functioned for the most part as it 
had in the past, with McHeffey wielding a tremendous amount of power. Some of 
the new board members began to question whether this style of leadership on the 
school board continued to be in the best interests of the community.</p>

CISCO 
SYSTEMS: BRIDGING A GATEWAY BETWEEN EUROPE AND INDIA <br>
<strong>Javier 
Busquets &amp; Juan Blanco</strong><strong>ESADE Business School, Universidad 
Ramon Llull</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This is a case about strategic management of innovation within a 
technological firm, CISCO Systems. The case focuses on: (1) how to make sense, 
assess and develop a project based on the new paradigm of &ldquo;cloud 
computing&rdquo;; (2) the change in CISCO strategy and, as a consequence, (3) 
how to design its globalization strategy. The case describes a story focused on 
Europe and India.<strong>This &ldquo;living case&rdquo; describes an ongoing 
effort within the firm.</strong>At the time of writing, management at CISCO was 
completely dedicated to defining the company&rsquo;s strategic change. The 
instructor&rsquo;s strategy should be to help students situate 
&ldquo;ideas&rdquo; and &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; within the realm of realistic 
commitments and the realistic mobilization of resources, seeing innovation as a 
bridge between imagination and reality. We also feel that studying CISCO is a 
good metaphor for this bridge. The case objectives also aim to foment critical 
thinking in students, but above all, they ask students to see creativity not as 
daydreaming, but as a methodological exercise to understand the limits of 
reality and to manage a company so that it takes actions and makes realistic 
commitments. </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
The case asks students to put themselves in Jordi 
Botifoll&rsquo;s shoes (Vice President of CISCO Europe, Mediterranean Area) to 
decide on the key priorities and questions to consider when developing a 
specific plan for a Digital or Smart City based on the new Internet parading 
(or the Internet of things), in this case Barcelona. For this, Botifoll must 
work with Syed Hoda (Director of Operations in India) and Wim Elfrink Chief 
Globalization Officer (CGO) and Senior Vice President. The case describes how 
CISCO is shifting from a &ldquo;product centric&rdquo; company towards a 
solution-focused one. The case also centers on the Mediterranean division, 
created in 2009, and its relationship with India from initial off-shoring 
projects to 2007 when CISCO created its Globalization Center East, in practical 
terms, a second Headquarters in Bangalore, India. The case describes how the 
company's aim was to &ldquo;capture&rdquo; both the GDP shift moving towards 
the East and new sources in the Asia Pacific, including the development of 
business models. However, it also questions if we are currently experiencing a 
major shift towards a non-USA centric future for Information Technology firms. 
In consequence, the case focuses on Smart City initiatives. Starting in the 
Gulf Region, this initiative is capturing a lot of attention due to the 
phenomenal opportunity it represents to discuss the future of Internet as seen 
in traffic control; smart electric grids to gain efficiency and reduce CO2 
emissions; and harbor management; and Unified Communications, among others. The 
case describes the opportunity to apply this concept to Barcelona, leveraging

ETRAFFIC PRESS: TEXTS FOR THE 21ST 
CENTURY <br>
<strong>Rebecca Grant and Suzanne Hobden</strong><strong>
University of Victoria</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case illustrates the challenges for a small 
publishing company that wants to introduce disruptive new approaches into the 
K-12 textbook market. Etraffic Press competes against three large, well-known 
publishers in an environment dominated by traditional practice and government 
decision-making. The inclination is to promote the eco-friendly elements of its 
digital content, on-demand printing and alternative delivery media. Student 
analysis will reveal that decision-makers aren&rsquo;t really walking the walk 
when it comes to carbon reduction targets in education. How, then, can Etraffic 
Press penetrate the very lucrative textbook market? The case was written for 
MBA level courses, where it could be used in e-business, strategy or marketing 
courses.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In spring 2008, learning and teaching methods were changing in Canada, 
opening up opportunities for companies that could respond to those changes. The 
three major Canadian publishing firms had thus far been unsuccessful in 
creating quality online resources, but they were eager to gain a share of the 
market.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>In addition to interest in changing education, the public expected 
suppliers to be more eco-friendly. The upcoming 2010 &ldquo;Green 
Olympics&rdquo; in Vancouver, the public&rsquo;s rising environmental 
consciousness, and national attention to climate change all contributed to a 
sense of urgency among businesses and public organizations &ndash; with the 
notable exception of educational publishing. Despite consuming 20 million trees 
and transporting over a million tons of books each year, textbook suppliers had 
demonstrated little if any innovation in the past century.</p> Victoria 
B.C.-based Etraffic Press seemed poised to revamp educational publishing with 
its low-priced and cutting edge online and flash-drive learning resources, as 
well as its print-on-demand textbooks. There was no shortage of arguments in 
favor of Etraffic&rsquo;s innovative new models, but schools seemed slow to 
respond. Etraffic had a head start on the online learning world and needed a 
strategy to distinguish them and grow their current market share. Michelle 
Jeske, VP of Business Management, knew that it would take more than visionary 
ideas to bring real change to traditional K-12 educational resources. Her 
problem was to determine which of many options would move Etraffic forward.

3M: SPECIFIC MARKET 
DEVELOPMENT <br>
<strong>Javier J. O. Silva, Mart&iacute;n Zemborain, Fernando 
Zerboni &amp; Maricruz Prado</strong><strong>IAE Business School &ndash; 
Austral University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case may be addressed in different ways, contingent upon 
students&rsquo; profile and experience, number of sessions available and 
teaching objectives. The case is divided into three parts: Case A poses the 
complexity of accessing the market with a sector-based product vision. Case B 
deals with the wine sector and a more standardized vision of B2B analysis, 
while Case C presents the mining sector with its highly complex structure.</p> 
&nbsp; 
<p>This case may be used in advanced marketing courses for MBA programs as 
well as in specific executive education programs addressing key account 
management (KAM), global account management (GAM) and/or industrial marketing 
or business to business marketing issues.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In 2007, 3M Argentina&rsquo;s management team was evaluating growth 
alternatives. Specific market development posed challenging questions for a 
company with a commercial scheme based on products. The team knew they should 
align the company&rsquo;s organizational structure to the commercial strategy 
of choice, but how could they build an action plan that contemplated this 
alignment? Was it possible to grow through specific market development or 
should they consider other options?</p> 
<p>After analyzing each market&rsquo;s core features and growth opportunities, 
and determining their complexities and how much knowledge the company actually 
had on each of them, two markets were selected: the wine business and the 
mining business. The former featured a local market with multiple actors 
engaged in complex relationships, while the latter exhibited a higher 
concentration at the international level. Each project displayed particular 
complexities at the domestic and international level. Therefore, they called 
for different management schemes. This case encourages class participants to 
discuss, in the first place, complexities arousing from the decision to 
implement specific market development and, second, to formulate an action plan 
for each market selected in order to achieve greater penetration and growth. 
This will require a deep analysis of each market&rsquo;s structure, its 
specific customers and account management systems.</p>

CEJA VINEYARDS: MARKETING TO THE 
HISPANIC WINE CONSUMER? <br>
<strong>Linda Nowak &amp; Armand Gilinsky, Sonoma 
State University,</strong><strong>Ricardo Villarreal de Silva, University of 
San Francisco,</strong><strong>Cristina Santini, University of Florence</strong>
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case presents the growth and development of a small, family owned 
winery.&nbsp; It is designed to be a culminating case in a marketing management 
course in which all aspects of marketing management and strategy are pulled 
together to analyze the case and develop recommendations.&nbsp; This case can 
be used in either an undergraduate capstone marketing management course or a 
graduate marketing management course. By analyzing and discussing the case, 
students should be able to: (1) develop a greater understanding of the wine 
industry and the challenges facing small wineries in an extremely competitive 
environment, (2) effectively use a SWOT analysis to analyze the company&rsquo;s 
resources, customers,&nbsp; competitors, and external market factors, (3) 
effectively develop screening criteria to evaluate opportunities, (4) know what 
market segmentation is and how to segment product markets into submarkets, (5) 
know the relationship between differentiation, positioning, and targeting, and 
(6) be able to develop strategic recommendations that are supported with sound 
theory and market information.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>After celebrating their nineteenth harvest and seventh year as California 
producers and marketers of premium wine in September 2007, the Mexican-born 
owners of Ceja Vineyards were considering whether or not to make a concerted 
effort to target U.S. Hispanic consumers.&nbsp; Doing so would enable Ceja to 
capitalize on its heritage as one of the first Hispanic-owned and operated wine 
businesses in America, but this was no easy decision.&nbsp; Targeting the 
emerging and potentially vast U.S. Hispanic consumer segment might require 
extensive repositioning of Ceja&rsquo;s premium varietal wine brands, result in 
a diminution of effort to sustain its rapidly growing wine club, pose 
additional future expenses for promotion of wine consumption to U.S. Hispanic 
consumers, and erode the high-end premium wine brand.&nbsp; In addition, the 
Hispanic wine consumer living outside the U.S. represented another high 
potential market and was of serious interest to Amelia Ceja, co-founder of the 
winery, and her partners.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case includes detail on the history and business operations of the 
winery, background data on the U.S. Wine Industry, demographics of U.S. Wine 
Consumers, and U.S. demographic forecasts through 2025.&nbsp; The case also 
provides a detailed description of the family&rsquo;s business philosophy and 
their vision for the growth and sustainability of Ceja Vineyards.</p>

KINDLE-DX: RETHINKING AMAZON.COM&#146;S STRATEGY TO TARGET COLLEGE 
STUDENTS <br>
<strong>Saroja Subrahmanyan &amp; Jung-Jae Lee</strong><strong>
Saint Mary&rsquo;s College of California</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case describes the launch and marketing of a new 
generation model of an e-reader, a product category that has still not diffused 
into the main stream marketplace.&nbsp; The product potentially offers a lot of 
benefits, but carries a high upfront price.&nbsp; The new model is targeted at 
a segment is large but price sensitive and which may not be convinced of its 
value.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main objective of the case is to help students 
critically examine the marketing issues that accelerate or inhibit the adoption 
of a product in its early stages.&nbsp; This allows for the case to be 
discussed from several angles and to tie in various aspects of a marketing 
strategy such as the 4Ps (Product, Price, Place &amp; Promotion) and the 5Cs 
(Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, Context).&nbsp;&nbsp; The case 
can also be used to focus on specific issues in a consumer behavior class (such 
as on disruptive consumer behavior) or in a new product development course to 
talk about early adoption phase of a product.&nbsp; These can be related to 
discussion on pricing strategies such as skim versus penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The case was written for a graduate level course in marketing.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
This case concerns Amazon.com&rsquo;s marketing strategy 
for the e-reader, the Kindle-DX.&nbsp; This model, which has a larger screen 
than its predecessor, was launched in early May 2009 and targeted at the 
college student market.&nbsp; E-readers potentially offer a lot of benefits to 
students as they combine the experience of reading actual print with the 
benefits of digitization and portability.&nbsp; Although e-readers has been 
available since 2006, it is still in the early adopter phase and not yet 
popular in the mainstream market.&nbsp; Amazon has partnered with some 
universities and textbook publishers to offer a pilot program in the coming 
academic year to test the responsiveness of this market.&nbsp; However, a high 
price tag of $489, alternate ways to access digital texts and intensified 
competition from other electronic readers all pose major threats to Kindle-DX.
&nbsp;Is Amazon.com targeting the right segment for this brand?&nbsp; If it 
aims to capture the higher education market, is the marketing strategy 
appropriate?</p> The authors developed the case for class discussion rather 
than to illustrate the effective or ineffective handling of the situation.&nbsp;

OFFICENET: DECIDING WHETHER TO 
CONTINUE DELEGATING THE PRICING AUTHORITY <br>
<strong>Andr&eacute;s Terech, 
Javier J. O. Silva, &amp; Maria Barale</strong><strong>IAE Business School 
&ndash; Austral University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
&ldquo;Officenet: Deciding whether to continue 
delegating the pricing authority&rdquo;&nbsp; may be used in initial marketing 
courses included in MBA curricula, executive education programs, as well as 
specific pricing courses. </p> 
<p>This case may be used to help students to advance their knowledge on price 
policies and delegation of pricing decision and to learn more about the 
challenges faced by companies implementing pricing strategy changes and their 
repercussions on: Sales force, organizational culture, customer relationships, 
competitors&rsquo; prices and profitability.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>After six years of negative net profitability, Officenet (ON), 
Argentina&rsquo;s leading office supply vendor, started to show signs of 
positive results. However, its performance still lagged far behind 
STAPLES&rsquo; net profits. This U.S.-based global industry leader owned ON 
since the end of 2004. In mid 2005, Leo Piccioli took over as ON&rsquo;s 
General Manager, knowing full well that his key challenge lay in driving ON to 
reach Staples&rsquo; profitability levels. He was also aware of the fact that 
one of the reasons for ON&rsquo;s low profitability rested with the 
company&rsquo;s sales force. Free to set prices for specific quotes, sales 
agents used to grant significant discounts (40 percent of the items in an order 
were priced below their regular prices) to their customers. Piccioli needed to 
revise the company&rsquo;s pricing policy. Should ON change the pricing 
delegation practices that were so embedded in its organizational culture? Or 
could it raise its prices and maintain its current policies? How would its 
competitors react? The case describes this scenario, inviting class 
participants to delve into topics associated with pricing delegation and price 
policies.</p>

<br> ONLINE ADVERTISING AT STOCKWEB- A SMALL BUSINESS DILEMMA <br>
<strong>
David Noreen &amp; Deborah R. Ettington</strong><strong>The Pennsylvania State 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case unveils a situation where a small business faces competitive 
headwinds and must decide upon a new direction at the firm. This case asks the 
question &ldquo;<em>Is it time to sell the firm to a larger company that can 
use what we&rsquo;ve built in their long term strategy, or do we go it alone 
and bolster our product offering, with the knowledge we might be alienating our 
current customer base?&rdquo;</em> This is both a marketing and 
entrepreneurship question. Using keyword cost data provided by two major search 
engines, StockWeb employees can see the costs of acquiring accounts will soon 
outstrip the lifetime value of the customers they are acquiring. This is the 
marketing question. The firm weighs choices about future directions. Some 
initial marketing research data shows only lackluster support for the new 
product offerings that StockWeb wants to roll out to their customer base. 
Deciding which direction to proceed will prove crucial for the existence of the 
firm. This is the entrepreneurial question. This case was written for an MBA 
elective marketing course called &lsquo;e-Marketing&rsquo; with the course 
objective being to help students learn to design and deploy effective marketing 
strategies for a digital networked, global, and mobile economy. The case can 
also be used in an entrepreneurial class which emphasizes weighing strategic 
options in small businesses.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Jeff Simpson was appointed CEO of StockWeb in 1998. The company&rsquo;s 
business model was modified in 1999 to create an online investment brokerage 
that catered to small- and medium-sized investors. The firm strategy was one 
that encouraged its investors to buy-and-hold quality investments for the 
long-term. The company believed that through proper education it could help 
less financially-educated individuals take a disciplined-themed retirement 
planning approach.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>Due to the nature of StockWeb&rsquo;s business model, customer lifetime 
value amounts was much lower than other competing online brokerages. 
StockWeb&rsquo;s management team saw three key options to helping the company 
make the adjustments to their advertising costs dilemma. Possible solutions 
included adding a new business-to-business unit; integrating new product lines 
to enhance the retail customer experience; or to sell the business to a larger 
player where an acquisition in the financial services sector made long-term 
success. Deciding which path to take would prove to be a hard choice.</p>

MANAGING SALES FORCE ATTRITION AT KARNAVATI HEALTHCARE LTD. <br>
<strong>Keyoor 
Purani &amp; Unnikrishnan Nair</strong><strong>Indian Institute of Management 
Kozhikode</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case on severe attrition faced by a Pharma Company 
in India provides a realistic context for students to understand and 
vicariously experience the competitive, high pressure nature of sales jobs. It 
enables them to conceptualize sales force attrition, analyse it in an 
organizational context, and to come up with pragmatic solutions. It exposes 
them to related issues, like, organization design for sales management; 
theories/ approaches of motivating sales force; role of top management in 
building employee commitment; &lsquo;Head Office&ndash;Field&rsquo; relations; 
the critical role of immediate boss; and so on. Crucially, it can draw 
attention of Marketing Students/ Managers to the importance of HR function and 
the need and challenge of effective people management for marketing success. A 
discerning reader may also find opportunity to introspect on the not so 
brighter side of sales and marketing caused due to high sales pressure/ 
unrealistic targets. This case can be considered for use in the MBA basic 
Marketing Course with Sales Force Management as a theme or in a specialized 
elective on Sales/ Distribution Management. It could also be used in similarly 
oriented Training Programs for Marketing Executives.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Karnavati Healthcare Ltd. (KHL), a large Pharma Company 
near Ahmedabad in western India, was facing severe sales force turnover in its 
Human Branded Formulations SBU (B-SBU). All three divisions B-SBU: Le Sante, 
Pharma and IRM Pharma were adversely affected. It had become the issue of 
highest concern to KHL Top Management that they appointed a team of Consultants 
from a top notch marketing and advertising school in the city to study and 
recommend solutions. Over a period of six months, the Consultants conducted 
extensive research: studying internal records, analyzing the industry and 
environment, interviewing KHL employees and executing a division wide survey 
named &lsquo;Manpower Mood Meter.&rsquo; With trends like megabrands, product 
patenting and internet savvy patients rapidly transforming the face of Indian 
Pharma Industry, there was high immense pressure on KHL Top Management for 
swift but well crafted responses to the attrition issue. The case details 
Consultants&rsquo; engagement with KHL, presents data gathered by them, and 
gives some indicative analysis. It ends with the Consultants being ready with 
the final report for presentation to KHL.</p> The authors developed the case

TEAM COMPUTERS 2008 <br>

<strong>Jaydeep Mukherjee &amp; Ashok Kapoor</strong><strong>Management 
Development Institute, Gurgaon, India</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case shows how the CEO of Team Computers, an 
entrepreneurial venture, was coping with the problem of creating a unique 
identity for the organization. It tracked the evolution of an embryonic 
organization to an Indian Rupees (INR) 2.3 Billion organization with 1500 
employees. It also highlights that an organization could become quite big 
without a very well defined positioning in the mind of its consumers and even 
its employees, simply because of the owners personal skills and insights which 
worked in the market. It highlights the key challenges for Team computers with 
respect to its transition to a more professional, system driven and a market 
oriented company. The case provides enough evidence to evaluate the positioning 
options of the company, the criteria to finalize the positioning options. It 
also opens up the possibility to discuss changes in organizational structure 
required to implement the positioning. The case also opens up the debate about 
conditions under which democratic process might not be the best way to decide 
on positioning. And when the CEO should take the ownership to define the 
positioning platform for the organization and cascade to the rest of the 
organization, and the limitation of such a process.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Ranjan Chopra, Director of Team Computers Pvt. Limited, a 
Delhi based systems integrator and solution provider, was planning the next 
leap for the company. Team Computers had emerged as a large IT Infrastructure 
Solution provider supporting more than 600 mid market customers across India 
and some overseas clients. He felt that his company had potential to have the 
best in class global processes and had kept in pace with the evolving needs of 
its clients &amp; the ever changing strides of the IT industry. Ranjan knew 
that the growth and financials of the company in the last few years had been 
good and qualitatively he had been able to make Team Computers a force to 
reckon with in the market and achieve industry recognition. However, he felt 
that the future growth of the company would depend on his being able to steer 
Team Computers from a sales oriented to a marketing oriented organization. With 
increasingly competitive market place, a distinct image of the company was 
almost a prerequisite to the vision of sustainable, profitable growth for the 
company. The problem was inherent in the market condition of intense 
competition among the firms and high degree of employee turnover which plagued 
the industry. The biggest challenge was to arrive at such a positioning. The 
case focuses on the challenge of deciding on a positioning platform for the 
company, considering its checkered evolution and in the context of difficult to 
predict future trajectory of fast changing IT business landscape.</p> The 
authors developed the case for class discussion rather than to illustrate

THE MARCH OF DIMES: MARKETING IN THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTOR <br>

<strong>Nita L. Paden, M. David Albritton &amp; Jennifer M. Mitchell</strong>
<strong>Northern Arizona University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case study is designed so that students can 
evaluate the relevance of the March of Dimes&rsquo; market position and to 
provide possible solutions to rejuvenate an established brand.&nbsp; This case 
is intended to help students recognize factors that suggest re-evaluation of a 
brand. Here, students are given information to evaluate a positioning strategy, 
to analyze data, and to identify major marketing concerns.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
this case is designed so students can evaluate the relationship between 
strategic mission, brand image and associations, and perceptions of the target 
market. The case can be used in either a structured or unstructured format. 
With the structured approach, the instructor can select questions relating to 
the specific topic of interest (e.g. branding) and assign those questions, 
followed by class discussion. The questions can be assigned as homework to 
individual students with classroom discussion on the assignment due date, or 
the questions can be addressed in small groups in class. Alternately, the case 
could be used in a less structured approach. In this approach, the students 
should not be prompted on specific issues, but rather allow them to develop a 
SWOT or environmental analysis to discover for themselves the critical issues 
affecting the firm.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
The case involves the March of Dimes Birth Defects 
Foundation (MOD), &ldquo;the leading nonprofit organization for pregnancy and 
baby health.&rdquo;&nbsp; MOD supports research and provides community services 
and education to save babies&rsquo; lives (www.marchofdimes.com).&nbsp; The 
strategy issue in the case involves how to re-position and market a 
not-for-profit brand in a changed environment. The main protagonists are Dr. 
Jennifer Howse, president of the March of Dimes; Doug Staples, senior 
vice-president for marketing and communications; and an employee of Barkley 
Agency, hired to assist in the rebranding of MOD. A quantitative study among 
adults 18+ revealed that March of Dimes ranked fifth in unaided awareness among 
charities in 2006.&nbsp; However, there was a significant drop in unaided 
recognition of March of Dimes from 22% in 1993 to 9%.&nbsp; The results of this 
research were the catalyst for the organization to re-evaluate how the services 
offered by March of Dimes were perceived by consumers.&nbsp; While Americans 
surveyed were aware of its signature fundraising event, WalkAmerica, recall of 
other aspects of MOD were fairly generic and in many ways conflicted with the 
stated mission of this not-for-profit organization.&nbsp; A related concern for 
MOD was that consumer perceptions about the seriousness and frequency of 
prematurity and low birth weight were shifting. Research showed the number of 
Americans who thought prematurity was a serious issue and a common occurrence 
declined in 2006 from the previous year.&nbsp; MOD was particularly alarmed 
that prematurity and low birth weights were not being considered as important 
as they had been in the past.</p>

Not for Profit<br>

<br> CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT ROCKY MOUNTAIN MUTUAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION <br>

<strong>Gordon Von Stroh and Vijaya Narapareddy</strong><strong>University of 
Denver</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
In 2003, Rocky Mountain Mutual Housing Association 
(&ldquo;the Mutual&rdquo;) was in dire financial straits.&nbsp; Falling 
property values and negative cash flows forced Board members to decide about 
its future.&nbsp; The case deals with corporate governance issues surrounding 
growth at the Mutual in the 1990s and the strategic decision the Board faced.
&nbsp;The primary case objective is to enable students to evaluate the 
Mutual&rsquo;s future and decide whether the Board should pull the plug or 
continue with its commitment to provide affordable housing and other social 
programs for its low income members.This case is suitable for use in 
undergraduate and graduate courses in Non-Profit Management, Public Policy, and 
Business Strategy &amp; Policy.&nbsp; <br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Rocky Mountain Mutual Housing Association (&ldquo;the Mutual&rdquo;) was a 
not-for-profit affordable housing organization incorporated in Denver, 
Colorado, in April 1992. The Mutual was founded for the purpose of acquiring, 
developing and managing affordable multi-family housing to meet a growing 
social need for low cost affordable housing.&nbsp; The idea of &ldquo;mutual 
housing&rdquo; was based on a European residential model which provided 
permanent housing to anyone who was motivated to meet the obligations and 
challenges associated with homeownership. A fundamental feature of the 
Mutual&rsquo;s mission was to provide services to its residents in a variety of 
areas, including job training, after-school programs and homeownership 
programs. The overall goal of these programs was to provide the residents with 
the tools for gaining equity and equality in the housing market.&nbsp; A unique 
attribute of these &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; communities was direct resident 
involvement in the management and decisions that affected the communities.&nbsp;
</p> The case describes the aggressive expansion undertaken in the 1990s, and 
the operational and financial challenges faced by the Mutual when the housing 
market and local economy took a nosedive, adversely affecting property values 
and cash flows since the dotcom bust.&nbsp; While lien holders and experts in 
the field, such as HUD, mortgage holders, and industry accountants, urged the 
Mutual to file for bankruptcy, the Mutual&rsquo;s Chairman was unyielding.&nbsp;
Despite the high number of board resignations on the Board and among 
Mutual&rsquo;s executive staff, Dr. Gordman, the Mutual&rsquo;s Chair, was 
adamant about the Association&rsquo;s ability to recover and its potential 
future.&nbsp; The case focuses on the strategic decision of whether the Mutual 
should file for bankruptcy and sell the properties or to stay committed to its 
mission and continue operations. 
<p></p> The authors developed the case for class discussion rather than to

INTERNSHIPS AT 
VIRTUOSI CONCERTS <br>
<strong>John Melnyk &amp; Tristan Friesen</strong>
<strong>The University of Winnipeg</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case is suitable for use at the undergraduate or 
MBA level in Not-for-Profit Management courses, as well as executive education 
classes for boards of directors and arts managers.&nbsp; Although the case 
deals with an idiosyncratic organization &ndash; a not-for-profit subsidiary of 
a university, executive-directed by a tenured psychology professor &ndash; and 
an idiosyncratic decision &ndash; whether or not to build student interns into 
a restructured organization &ndash; a good discussion will surface some 
generalizable issues in not-for-profit management.&nbsp; These include: how a 
decision should be framed for a board&rsquo;s consideration, how malleable an 
organization&rsquo;s mandate should be, managing a relationship with a major 
funder, business challenges for short-staffed small organizations, and 
organizational structure in relation to business performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Virtuosi Concerts (MB) Inc. (VCI) was a small arts organization, 
incorporated as a not-for-profit subsidiary of The University of Winnipeg, in 
Winnipeg, Manitoba CANADA.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was founded in 1991 by Harry Strub, a 
psychology professor who served as its Executive Director.&nbsp; Under his 
direction VCI became a leading chamber music and recital series of the Winnipeg 
arts scene. Under the terms of the then current university collective agreement 
with the university faculty association, Harry had to retire by September 2009 
and VCI Manager Gail Bauer, who had worked very closely with Harry for several 
years, indicated she would retire in June 2009.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>In response to these upcoming transitions the board initiated a strategic 
planning exercise that decided the organization would be restructured into a 
&ldquo;two-headed&rdquo; model with an Artistic Director responsible for 
programming and a General Manager responsible for the business operations both 
reporting to the board.&nbsp; Furthermore, the plan called for a feasibility 
study of the possibility of involving student interns in an integral way in the 
ongoing administration of VCI.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>That feasibility study led to a two-stage internship pilot project to gain 
experience with accounting, human resources (volunteer coordination) and 
fundraising interns.&nbsp; Results were mixed, but in November 2008 the board 
had to decide if the new general manager should be hired under the assumption 
that student interns would be part of the VCI organizational structure.</p>

THE WOMEN&#146;S BEAN PROJECT (2008) <br>
<strong>Angel Moreno, Vijaya 
Narapareddy, and Nancy Sampson</strong><strong>University of Denver</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Bean Project is a unique social enterprise located in 
Denver, Colorado.&nbsp; Established in 1989 as a non-profit organization by 
Jossy Eyre, the Women&rsquo;s Bean Project (WBP) is dedicated to assisting 
women break the cycle of poverty and alleviate the problem chronic unemployment 
among the underprivileged and underserved women in the community.&nbsp; The 
fact that the founder was interviewed by PBS is a testament to its success in 
creating exceptional value to the disadvantaged women it serves.&nbsp; The 
objectives of this case are to raise awareness of this highly successful 
non-profit organization, and to allow students to evaluate WBP&rsquo;s decision 
of diversifying into a new jewelry-making venture.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Using business to create social change is difficult.&nbsp; The social 
enterprise sector as a whole needs more relevant support from the public sector 
in order to flourish.&nbsp; However, previous experience with public sector 
support has demonstrated challenges for the Women&rsquo;s Bean Project (WBP).
&nbsp;Past funding opportunities proved to be unsuccessful; funding sources 
were withdrawn, unorganized, and ineffective.&nbsp; Further, the women did not 
have positive experiences with various agencies which lead to wary 
participation of potential programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> &nbsp; 
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Bean Project is a place where women can go when other 
options have failed.&nbsp; Working with organizations to help women transition 
back into society is a primary goal of the Women&rsquo;s Bean Project.&nbsp; 
However, its ability to help employ women is driven by its sales, donations, 
and grants.&nbsp; Sales are reliant on public awareness of the organization and 
its mission.&nbsp; Faced with the possibility of declining sales in 2009 in a 
crisis-ridden economy, WBP&rsquo;s executive members proactively consider 
adding jewelry items to its core product line and work with retailers in the 
local art districts to sell its new product line.&nbsp; The central focus of 
this case is to evaluate this new diversification move from a strategic and 
operational perspective.</p>

THINK HUMANITY AND THE KYANGWALI REFUGEES <br>

<strong>Cindy Rauschenberger, The Women&rsquo;s College, University of Denver
</strong> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;Vi Narapareddy (Faculty Supervisor), University of Denver
</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case tells the story of Beth Heckel and her discovery of the suffering 
and survival endured at the Kyangwali Refugee camp in Uganda.&nbsp; Beth Heckel 
began developing relationships with key individuals at Kyangwali through her 
daughter Aimee and soon began to realize what huge impacts she could make for 
these refugees with little as $5.00.&nbsp; This $5.00 would provide a mosquito 
net to prevent the number one cause of death at the camp, malaria.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Beth has built lasting relationships with individuals at Kyangwali by allowing 
them the dignity they deserve in the value of their life by caring for what 
happens to them.&nbsp; However, Beth is not just caring, she is taking action.
&nbsp;In addition to raising and sending money, Beth is mentoring these 
refugees and raising awareness through her website of the dire needs at 
Kyangwali. The objectives of this case are:&nbsp; i) to understand how one 
individual, Beth Heckel, took on this cause with the help of her family and has 
made such an impact in so many ways in a short period of time, ii) observe the 
process of empowering a community with projects that benefit the community as a 
whole, and iii) evaluate the struggles a non-profit faces in raising funds, and 
iv) recommend strategies for Think Humanity to become sustainable long term.
&nbsp;The case was written for undergraduate and graduate courses in global 
social entrepreneurship, and non-profit management.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Kyangwali is a refugee camp located approximately 30 miles outside of 
Hoima, Uganda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beth began to raise funds through selling 
books on e-Bay, grants and personal donations and developed the non-profit 
Think Humanity in 2007.&nbsp; Her communications led to managers on the ground 
for TH in Kyangwali relaying the immediate needs and then TH meeting or 
collaborating to meet those needs.&nbsp; Beth is not giving a hand out to the 
people, she is giving a hand up empowering them to make key decisions as well 
as raise money for projects in collaboration with Think Humanity.&nbsp; 
Beth&rsquo;s dream of helping provide nets and medications to Kyangwali has 
evolved to many more projects such as building an orphanage and preschool on 
land donated by the commandant of the camp, helping young women in a hostel 
with their room, board food, medications which allows them to further their 
education off-site from the camp, build a sustainable garden and livestock 
project which also helps sustain the orphanage and women&rsquo;s hostel and 
provides jobs for the locals.&nbsp; One of the major problems Beth faces is how 
to sustain and raise the money needed so desperately in order to provide the 
needs and care the refugees deserve.&nbsp; Faced with an economic crisis at 
home, Beth was forced to reduce her budget in 2009 to accommodate the down 
turn; however, the needs in the camp are growing as ever before.</p>

exercise to illustrate the challenges faced when meeting the needs of thousands.

<br> BJR WOOD MANUFACTURING: AN EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT DECISION <br>
<strong>
Barb Reimbold &amp; Nancy M. Levenburg</strong><strong>Grand Valley State 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case focuses on the detection of a quality problem as a symptom of the 
need for equipment maintenance, refurbishment, or replacement &ndash; areas 
that are often overlooked in studies of operations management.&nbsp; It deals, 
therefore, with the impact that nonconforming parts can have on a manufacturing 
process, and allows students to explore its possible remedies, using detailed 
text and supplemental exhibits for analysis.&nbsp; Specific case objectives 
include:&nbsp; (1) Illustrate issues and challenges associated with miterfold 
construction, including core competency strategic fit analysis; (2) Compare and 
contrast existing and potential miterfold capabilities; (3) Evaluate various 
manufacturing equipment replacement options for miterfold construction; and (4) 
Develop potential implementation options for an equipment replacement decision.
</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case would be useful in upper-level undergraduate courses in Operations 
Management, or those focusing on quality management, manufacturing process 
selection and design, or operations strategy.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>BJR is an office furniture manufacturing company that has been in operation 
for nearly 100 years.&nbsp; Quality is a key component of its business model 
and how the company purports to distinguish itself in the marketplace.&nbsp; 
However, in 2008, 100 percent of miter edge customer complaints from its high 
performance products were related to manufacturing.&nbsp; Additionally, 100 
percent of the miterfold edges were being touched up manually within the plant 
before being shipped to customers.&nbsp; How can BJR product higher quality 
products?&nbsp; Do they need a new machine or does the firm simply need to 
refurbish the old one?&nbsp; Which vendor should they use?&nbsp; If they are 
purchase a machine, should they use a new miterfold equipment option or stay 
with the current equipment option?&nbsp; How should all these options be 
evaluated and prioritized?</p> &nbsp; 
<p>By using the information within the case and the exhibits, the students 
have an opportunity to evaluate a firm&rsquo;s equipment maintenance procedures 
and an equipment replacement decision.</p>

CAPITAL VEHICLE SYSTEMS: AN EXPLORATION OF LEAN MANUFACTURING <br>

<strong>Melissa Vegter &amp; Nancy M. Levenburg</strong><strong>Grand Valley 
State University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>Students often gain instruction in Lean Manufacturing, but do not have an 
opportunity to see its implementation in practice.&nbsp; This case is designed 
to provoke questions regarding: (a) the philosophical underpinnings of lean; 
(b) the practical implications of how the values of those implementing lean 
affects the tools selected, and (c) the impact of lean implementation on an 
organization.&nbsp; The case places a particular focus on the Toyota Production 
System (TPS) and Scanlon Management System.&nbsp; Specific case objectives 
include:</p> &nbsp; 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand the requirements for Lean 
Manufacturing, and that its implementation will evolve over time.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the obstacles to implementing 
Lean Manufacturing.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify Organizational Philosophy and 
Values as reflected in production documents, attitudes, organizational 
structure, and role definition, and determine what the best and worst outcome 
can result from the underlying philosophy.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make recommendations regarding changes in 
Operations, and anticipate the consequences of those changes.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>This case is designed for use in classes that explore the operations, 
business strategy, business ethics, or organizational dynamics.&nbsp; The 
intent is to explore how organizational philosophy determines the 
implementation and efficacy of business tools.&nbsp; This case would be 
suitable for graduate courses or upper-level undergraduate courses where 
students have already been exposed to a breadth of operations management topics.

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Capital Vehicles Systems is a supplier of vehicle instrumentation systems, 
including gauges, system controllers, sensors, and display products.&nbsp; In 
2008, the firm faced several challenges as the economy weakened and the cost of 
plant returns and warranties remained high.&nbsp; What can the firm do to meet 
the strategic goals in the most cost effective manner?&nbsp; The case examines 
various ways in which Lean Manufacturing has been implemented.&nbsp; In 
analyzing the case, examine a variety of production-related documents, applying 
the principles of lean manufacturing to determine which aspects of lean have 
been applied well and which have not.</p>

ESTONIAN AIR&#146;S BIG BUY <br>
<strong>Karen Popovich, Diane Lander 
&amp; Robert Letovsky</strong><strong>Saint Michael&rsquo;s College</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case gives students a chance to build a decision model, either manually 
or using basic Excel formulas, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of 
four possible alternatives involving an aircraft acquisition.&nbsp; Following 
the guidelines in the case, students will be able to calculate fuel efficiency, 
fuel costs, and industry specific metrics, such as available seat kilometers, 
load distances, and number of flights needed to meet demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
case also illustrates issues of external environmental analysis.&nbsp; It was 
designed for undergraduate courses in Production and Operations Management, but 
is also well suited for a senior business strategy course that includes 
quantitative and qualitative decision making.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>It was mid-March 2007 and Rait Kalda, VP for Estonian Air Operations, faced 
a tough decision.&nbsp; Jet fuel prices had increased more than 50% in the last 
year, resulting in fuel costs accounting for almost 44% of passenger revenues, 
an increase from around 30% of passenger revenues.&nbsp; Meanwhile, market 
forecasts were predicting a significant increase in the demand for 
intra-European regional flights.&nbsp; In this time of high fuel prices, should 
Estonian Air respond to the projected increase in demand by expanding its fleet 
of planes?&nbsp; And, if so, should Estonian purchase regional jets or new 
model turboprops?</p> 
<p>Major benefits of using turboprops for short-leg flights were increased 
seat utilization (62% to 90%) and increased route coverage.&nbsp; Turboprops 
would be able to service at least 90% of Estonian Air&rsquo;s existing routes.
&nbsp;Rait considered Bombardier&rsquo;s new Q400 turboprop to be on his short 
list.&nbsp; A main concern was whether Estonian Air&rsquo;s passengers would 
look upon turboprops as a step backwards for the airline.&nbsp; He had to 
consider all foreseeable impacts of purchasing any new aircraft on Estonian 
Air&rsquo;s cost structure and bottom line.</p> 
<p>The next board meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon, and the board 
expected a recommendation on how Kalda planned to address the expected increase 
in intra-European regional flight demand in light of both high fuel prices and 
last year&rsquo;s net loss.</p>

<br> LEAN OPERATIONS AT GRAND RAPIDS PUBLIC LIBRARY <br>
<strong>Lisa Eshbach, 
Ferris State University</strong><strong>&nbsp;Lester Sutherland, U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case illustrates the improvements achieved through the implementation 
of Lean Administrative Methods by the Grand Rapids Public Library.&nbsp;The 
library was viewed as obese in comparison to other public libraries &ndash; 
there was a lot of duplication of efforts. Additionally, it experienced a high 
number of customer complaints and lack of effective internal and external 
communication prior to the lean implementation.&nbsp; The library&rsquo;s main 
goals were to eliminate customer complaints and communicate more effectively 
thereby, offering unique, excellent services to their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They accomplished some key objectives and goals, but now the effort and 
motivation to continue with applying the lean process is waning with the 
continuing shrinking budget. The director needs to develop a strategy on<em>
&ldquo;What type of strategy or process should she employ to rejuvenate the 
effort and thereby the level of motivation for the process?</em>This is the 
leadership issue.&nbsp; The case also examines how the lean training was 
conducted and the tools as well as the associated outcomes of using that 
process.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Should the library continue with the consultant 
training or should they try a different type of training program to sustain the 
new process?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em>This is the operations management issue. &nbsp;
The case was written for business school undergraduate and graduate level 
courses in operations management and leadership.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Marcia Warner became the Grand Rapids Public Library (GRPL) Director in 
2005. The library is the second largest public library system in Michigan and 
is located on the western side of the state.&nbsp; It operates seven branches 
in addition to its main facility.&nbsp; The main library is a depository for 
federal and state documents. Library holdings consist of 660,000 books, tapes, 
films, maps, and compact discs, periodicals, and special collections.&nbsp; The 
library includes a service area of 197,000 patrons and employs 175 full and 
part-time employees.&nbsp;Marcia expressed interest in lean soon after her 
arrival. In December of 2005, the GRPL contracted with a consultant to train 
Marcia and two assistant directors in the lean methodology. Shortly, 
thereafter, the GRPL implemented and applied the lean methods successfully to 
the GRPL processes and system.&nbsp; The excitement for applying lean to 
continuously improve the existing processes has decreased substantially in the 
last two years.&nbsp; However, Marcia has increased obligations to her patrons 
and board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Marcia reviewed her challenges of the increase 
in the circulation rates as well as the budget and staff decreases, she 
thought, &ldquo;How can we sustain the current level of customer service and 
motivate the staff to continue with the lean efforts?&rdquo;</p>

THE GREEN CHALLENGE COMES 
TO GUILDCRAFT FURNITURE <br>
<strong>Richard R. Young - The Pennsylvania State 
University</strong><strong>Steven C. Dunn - University of Wisconsin &ndash; 
Oshkosh</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case describes how the management of Guildcraft Furniture, a 
manufacturing company, is confronted by the immediate challenge of having its 
principal disposal method discontinued thereby forcing the choice of changing 
product design or finding alternative means for scrap disposition.&nbsp; 
Pursuit of the second option required substantial rethinking of the nature of 
the scrap and with additional investment in processing equipment, hiring direct 
labor, and incurring administrative overhead for sales and marketing.&nbsp; As 
a result Guildcraft developed multiple new products whose demand for scrap 
exceeded supply.&nbsp; Guildcraft now thinks of itself as a green manufacturer, 
but the question remains if such a moniker is appropriate vis-&agrave;-vis U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency definitions. As business school curricula 
increasingly introduce sustainability and environmental responsibility themes 
in both undergraduate as well as graduate programs, this case has applicability 
to several disciplines, but especially operations management and managerial 
accounting.&nbsp; This case can be used as the basis for class discussion 
and/or for a written assignment.&nbsp; It is suggested that it be limited to 
courses that are upper division (junior and senior levels) only and where 
students have been exposed to the use of cases.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Spero Dephtereos, CEO and principal stockholder of Guildcraft Furniture 
faced a critical problem of either 1) switching away from the use of 
polystyrene frames for his furniture in order to comply with an order from the 
local solid waste management authority to cease disposal of styrene scrap at 
its landfill, or 2) finding an alternative way to handle the disposition of the 
material which was seen as environmentally unfriendly. Through some research 
with his suppliers and trusted associates, Dephtereos discovered that scrap 
styrene foam could be turned into a range of alternative products ranging from 
concrete forms, packaging components, toy filling, and potting soil additive. 
Ultimately, a hierarchy of uses was determined whereby large scrap pieces could 
be reworked into packaging components custom cut for a range of applications. 
Anything remaining would be further converted into other salable products. 
While successful in avoiding disposal, the case questions whether Guildcraft is 
as green or environmentally responsible as its CEO both believes and touts.
&nbsp;While the firm has been able to reduce the quantity of material that it 
is required to dispose of, some may question that all they have done is 
transfer the disposal problem to others.</p>

TRELLEBORG AUTOMOTIVE: A GROWTH INITIATIVE DECISION <br>
<strong>Alain Giraud 
&amp; Nancy M. Levenburg</strong> 
<p><strong>Grand Valley State University</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>An automotive subcontractor is considering a major global growth initiative 
to restore profitability in the highly competitive rubber market, using 
microcellular polyurethane (MCU), a new material that was equivalent or 
superior to rubber and available at a lower price.&nbsp; The case is written to 
provide the framework for evaluating the decision within the context of 
business and operations strategy.&nbsp; Students gain an overview of the 
automotive industry, the company&rsquo;s business model and strategies, and the 
Anti-vibration Solutions (AVS) segment, in which the growth initiative 
originated.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>Specific case objectives include:&nbsp; (1) Conduct a financial analysis of 
Trelleborg Automotive, and compare and contrast its profitability with other 
business areas; (2) Examine the business model and the supply chain supporting 
the MCU growth initiative.&nbsp; Formulate recommendations with regard to the 
management of MCU raw material supplier and productions units; (3) Evaluate the 
company&rsquo;s competitive position, the ability for the MCU technology and 
the needs in term of development of Trelleborg Automotive within its primary 
markets (Americas, Europe and Asia); and (4) Appraise crucial competitive 
advantage through its MCU growth initiative.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The case would be useful in upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level 
courses in Operations Management and Supply Chain Management courses, 
particularly those with an engineering, manufacturing, or logistics emphasis, 
or International Business/Business Strategy.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In 2008, Trelleborg Automotive (TA) was the largest rubber non-tire 
manufacturer in the world, and its automotive business segment represented 30 
percent of its net sales.&nbsp; However, strong global competition in the 
automotive market resulted in low margins, and restoring sustainable 
profitability became a strategic priority for the firm.&nbsp; By using material 
alternatives to rubber and focusing on more profitable segments, the case 
explores whether the proposed growth initiative could support the long-term 
competitiveness of the firm.</p>

ADNEXUS THERAPEUTICS <br>
<strong>Susan Sieloff, 
Ray Kinnunen, Tucker Marion &amp; John Friar</strong><strong>Northeastern 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case covers Adnexus Therapeutics&rsquo; transition 
period after acquisition by Bristol-Meyers Squibb (BMS).&nbsp; Less than two 
years earlier in 2007, it had been acquired for $430 million by BMS, which gave 
it greater financial strength to pursue clinical development of its products.
&nbsp;The case centers around Eric Furfine, Senior Vice President of R&amp;D. 
Furfine was confident that the acquisition had been the best option for 
Adnexus, but the reality of the drug development process presents many 
challenges.&nbsp; The company could not rush its clinical trials, nor could it 
take regulatory shortcuts.&nbsp; He also knew that, as a subsidiary company, 
Adnexus had significant financial advantages over other independent 
biotechnology firms, but he also knew that additional resources would only come 
after positive clinical results. The challenge he and his colleagues faced was 
managing the clinical process, and ensuring that, from one phase to the next, 
milestones were consistently hit, with the ultimate goal being a product 
reaching the market.&nbsp; The case is suitable for a business strategy course 
or a new products, small business and/or entrepreneurship course at the 
undergraduate, MBA or executive MBA level. Its importance lies in its emphasis 
on evaluating the elements needed to create and manage a biotechnology new 
product development process and pipeline.&nbsp; It may be used in conjunction 
with the &lsquo;Agiltron, Inc.&rsquo; and &lsquo;Attivio: Deciding on an 
Enterprise Search Platform or Product&rsquo; cases as a unit in new product 
development across several different technology-based industries. The case 
requires that students:&nbsp; Understand the pharmaceutical development 
process, both within Adnexus /BMS and through the FDA approval process; 
and&nbsp;evaluate the resources needed to create an on-going development 
pipeline.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Adnexus Therapeutics (www.adnexustx.com) is a small 
biotechnology company, which has been recently acquired by BMS.&nbsp; Using its 
proprietary protein engineering technology PROfusion to isolate likely protein 
candidates among a class of proteins called Adnectins&trade;, the company 
sought to identify new drug therapies for specific diseases.&nbsp; Currently, 
the disease target was cancer and its lead drug Angiocept&trade; (CT-322) was 
in clinical trials with the FDA.&nbsp; While Angiocept&trade; has made progress 
toward FDA approval; in order to continue to develop other 
Adnectin&trade;-based drug therapies, they would have to add structure and 
process to the research, otherwise $30 million in recent investments would not 
go very far.&nbsp; In addition, the company had to effectively advocate for new 
therapies during the regulatory review process in order to get new therapies 
through to full commercialization.&nbsp; Furfine asks: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 
next? How can we accomplish all these tasks?</p> The authors developed the case 
for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective 
handling of the situation.&nbsp; The case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and

AGILTRON INCORPORATED <br>
<strong>Tucker Marion, John Friar, 
&amp; Ray Kinnunen</strong><strong>Northeastern University </strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case illustrates the R&amp;D development process for 
an SBIR funded technology business. It highlights the lack of market facing 
resources in the development process and asks the students to recommend 
strategies to improve the process and business strategy. The case is suitable 
for a business strategy course or a small business and/or entrepreneurship 
course at the undergraduate, MBA, or executive MBA level. Its importance lies 
in its discussion of the technology product development process, and the 
process of selecting what would be the best commercial market for a proven 
product or technology. The case may be used in conjunction with the 
&lsquo;Adnexus Theraputics&rsquo; and &lsquo;Attivio: Deciding on an Enterprise 
Search Platform or Product&rsquo; cases as a unit in new product development 
across several different technology-based industries.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>
The case requires that students:&bull;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain an understanding of 
the technology development process in firms that are not market facing, and how 
these types of firms differ from traditional firms where voice of the customer 
and marketing occur up-front during development.&bull;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop the 
skills/expertise required to look at the organization and determine what 
strategies might be employed to reduce the number of project on hiatus.<br>
</p>
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Agiltron Incorporated (www.agiltron.com) is a leading 
producer and developer of innovative photonic components and systems.&nbsp; 
Agiltron leads the market in optical switches, variable optical attenuators, 
high power optical components, optical polarization and time controls, and 
molded infrared detectors and lenses. Headquartered north of Boston, the 
company comprises a world-class team of serial entrepreneurs and veteran 
engineers including over 30 PhDs, making innovations for high-growth markets 
and&nbsp; serving customers worldwide.&nbsp;They have been perfecting optical 
devices for over 20 years, regrouped in 2001 from NZ Applied, JDSU, and 
Corning.&nbsp; There 2008 revenue was approximately $13 Million, with half of 
the revenue coming from SBIR-based research grants. This case describes the 
development of a new type of nano material for moisture reduction on clear 
surfaces (primarily anti-fog). The technology was funded via Phase I and II 
grants for a proposed NASA application.&nbsp; The technology developed met all 
expectations for the desired specification and application. However, after 
Phase II NASA decided to not move forward with the project due to other 
priorities. At this point, with no potential or active customer, the project 
was put on hiatus. With no active marketing or business development resources 
for the project, the founder and CEO of the company was deciding on options for 
the product as it &lsquo;sat on the shelf.</p> The authors developed the case

ATTIVIO INCORPORATED <br>

<strong>John Friar, Tucker Marion, &amp; Ray Kinnunen</strong><strong>
Northeastern University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case details the software development process at Attivio Inc. Attivio 
is an enterprise search company that had developed a core technology, the 
Active Intelligence Engine (AIE), which combined enterprise search and business 
intelligence capabilities to integrate unstructured and structured business 
data easily and intelligently. The technology enables customers to make better 
business decisions by offering a more comprehensive look at all of the 
information available to the company. Attivio had already developed a 
customizable platform using AIE as its base (Embedded AIE), which focused on 
the OEM market, and now they had to decide what their next steps should be.
<strong> </strong>The case is suitable for a business strategy course or a 
small business and/or entrepreneurship course at the undergraduate, MBA, or 
executive MBA level. Its importance lies in its discussion of the product 
development process, and the process of selecting what would be the best 
commercial market for a proven technology.&nbsp; It may be used in conjunction 
with the Agiltron and Adnexus cases as a unit in new product development across 
several different technology-based industries.&nbsp; The case requires that 
students:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain an 
understanding of the software development process and necessary resources;</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop the 
skills/expertise required to create plausible market share projections from 
available information to clarify management options.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Attivio Incorporated (www.attivio.com), a Newton, MA based enterprise 
search software development company, was in the process of deciding how to best 
commercialize their core technology, the Active Intelligence Engine (AIE). To 
this point, the company had received $6.2 million in venture capital funding 
with commitments for more investments, and already had three clients. They also 
had created a development platform using AIE as its base (Embedded AIE), which 
focused on the innovative user and OEM markets.</p> 
<p>The technology was proven to have worked very effectively, but now the 
decision was which direction the company should pursue: continuing to sell a 
customizable and extendable platform or creating a finished product for a 
particular customer segment.&nbsp; The management knew that developing a 
finished product was their best high-growth strategy, but it would involve 
directly competing with giants like Microsoft and IBM, which is something they 
wanted to avoid. The customizable and extendable platform would involve hiring 
more employees as they expanded, but it would also give them the opportunity 
for steady growth.</p>

<p>This field researched case focused on a small town long-standing department 
store. Chuck and Pam Carson are a husband and wife entrepreneurial team that 
has owned and operated a retail clothing store in Northeast Mississippi for 
over thirty years.&nbsp; Chuck has found success in another business venture 
and is pressing Pam to make some very difficult decisions regarding the future 
of the business.&nbsp; These decisions are complicated by the fact that there 
is no available family successor to take over the business. Another important 
issue is that these long-time marriage and business partners have different 
levels of emotional connection to the business and are not united on what 
should be the store&rsquo;s future.</p>

CRISIS MANAGEMENT AT CIRCLE 6 <br>

<p><strong>George L. Whaley &amp; Keith Perry</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;San Jose State University</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case demonstrates how a major position in a market 
niche can easily erode due to inattention of management and evolve into a 
crisis that threatens the viability of a small business.&nbsp; Management faced 
multiple, interrelated challenges in each stage of the emerging crisis. Circle 
6 started as a small entrepreneurial firm with computer telephony integration 
(CTI) software in the call center space and experienced the full life cycle 
between 1988 and 2004. In addition to investigating the effect of life cycles 
on Circle 6, students are asked to examine the external/ internal forces on the 
firm and how/why the crisis developed in order to prevent its demise. 
Management was the primary decision focus prior to April 2004; however, 
non-management employees became the primary decision-makers as the board 
members and management resigned en mass. Students are encouraged to use several 
levels of critical thinking skills and theoretical frameworks to develop and 
evaluate alternatives and recommend the best course of action.This case was 
designed for upper division undergraduate and MBA level courses in Small 
Business, Entrepreneurship and Strategy. The multifaceted nature of the crisis 
requires students to draw on their prior knowledge of theories across areas 
such as entrepreneurship, strategy, leadership, organizational change and 
management style to address the crisis at Circle 6.&nbsp; Therefore, the case 
may be appealing to a wide range of courses where handling a crisis is the 
central focus. Students are expected to recommend how Circle 6 should proceed 
from this crisis situation in May 2004 based on the appropriate theories, 
models and their own experiences. <br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Laird Pfizer was a senior software engineer at Circle 6 
in January 2004 who wrestled with the development of a memo to all company 
employees about the crisis involving the entire board and management expressing 
their intention to resign from the company. Circle 6 was a small 
entrepreneurial company that had pioneered mainframe call center software but 
allowed their product line to become antiquated. This resulted in a downward 
spiral following a series of strategic failures that led to the current crisis 
threatening the company&rsquo;s viability. Pfizer&rsquo;s role at Circle 6 
suddenly grew as he was asked to take on some management tasks in this 
leadership vacuum because of his action-oriented style. While uncomfortable 
with his emerging leadership role, he was more concerned about the 
company&rsquo;s downward spiral and his possible unemployment. It was clear 
that the Circle 6 board and management team had been dysfunctional but none of 
the remaining Circle 6 employees had experience running a company.&nbsp; Pfizer 
discussed his innermost concerns with another individual contributor as they 
discussed their new responsibilities: &ldquo;No more excuses, no one to hide 
behind, and the company&rsquo;s destiny will be in our hands. Now, what should 
we do?&rdquo;</p> The authors developed the case for class discussion rather 
than illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of the situation. The 
case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and synopsis were anonymously peer reviewed

<br> DON WALTERS AND NEXTBOK: CHANGING THE WAY HOUSES ARE BUILT <br>
<strong>
Stephen J.J. McGuire &amp; Gordon Bagot</strong><strong>California State 
University, Los Angeles</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case can be used to provide a broad overview of the challenges of 
entrepreneurship &ndash; even given a great product idea in an attractive 
market.&nbsp; Through the discussion of the innovative product features to the 
potential substitution of current building materials, the case underscores 
several challenging areas of entrepreneurship, none more so than funding a 
start-up and designing a business that will be attractive to investors.&nbsp; 
The learning objectives of the case focus primarily on: the scaling and 
financing of start-ups; the strategic positioning of innovative products in a 
very large market space; and the management of operations &ndash; from product 
and process design to supply chain management.&nbsp; The case is appropriate 
for the early part of undergraduate or graduate courses in 
Entrepreneurship/Small Business Management or Operations Management.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>With the deteriorating environment and declining natural resources, many 
green alternative materials have been proposed to meet the increasing demand 
for sustainable housing.&nbsp; NextBlok, a patented insulated concrete form 
(ICF) and associated building method, was designed to offer builders an 
easy-to-use framing material and homeowners a better house.&nbsp; NextBlok 
promised to reduce waste by using recycled Styrofoam, save trees, transform 
framing from cumbersome to easy, and provide homeowners with an affordable, 
energy-efficient and earthquake resistant house.&nbsp;Could NextBlok become the 
next market leader in framing materials, surpassing wood, steel and concrete?
&nbsp;Or were inventor Don Walters&rsquo; ambitions too grandiose?&nbsp; How 
could Walters raise the significant capital he claimed to need to get this 
project off the ground?&nbsp;Why was it proving so difficult to raise funds 
&ndash; was the venture simply too risky for potential investors, or had 
Walters knocked on the wrong doors?&nbsp;Should Walters (a) continue to seek 
investors with the current business plan; (b) seek a different source of 
funding; (c) substantially revise his plan or to make it more attractive to 
&lsquo;traditional&rsquo; investors; or (d) consider revising his entire 
business model, and sell or license the patent?</p>

JEAN&#146;S BRIDAL SHOP <br>
<strong>Carol J. 
Cumber &amp; Justine Kougl</strong><strong>&nbsp;South Dakota State University
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The Jean&rsquo;s Bridal Shop case encourages students to determine a 
business&rsquo;s current position by identifying the Key Success Factors of an 
industry and then determining whether an individual business possesses those 
factors. It challenges students to analyze a small business&rsquo;s financial 
standing based upon the reality that it is common for a small business to not 
keep or use extensive or comprehensive financial statements. In addition, 
students are required to conduct a SWOT analysis of the business and, based 
upon their analysis, make recommendations on how the business should position 
itself in the future.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>This case would be most appropriate for undergraduate students in small 
business management, entrepreneurship and strategic management courses.</p> <br>
<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>This field researched case focused on Jean&rsquo;s Bridal Shop of Wilmot, 
SD. Although the business was located in a sparsely populated, rural area of 
South Dakota, it was positioned to conveniently serve South Dakota, North 
Dakota, and Minnesota.&nbsp; The owners carried a large selection of gowns and 
discounted the attire one-fourth below the list price.&nbsp; These 
characteristics, along with superior customer service, had assisted the shop in 
establishing a large customer base despite its rural location.&nbsp; Although 
the large inventory assisted in attracting customers, most ultimately special 
ordered their attire.&nbsp; This created an overstocked inventory, forcing the 
business to drastically reduce prices on clearance gowns in order to move the 
inventory.&nbsp; Complicating financial management was that, as is common for 
small businesses, formal budgets were non-existent and accounting practices 
rudimentary. A central issue facing this organization was the need for 
inventory reduction in such a way that they did not lose their customer base. 
The bridal and formal wear industry was experiencing growth in online sales, 
therefore decreasing sales at traditional bridal shops.&nbsp; The growth of 
online sales affected the strategic plans of traditional bridal shops and 
required new strategies to be crafted.</p>

Peter, an executive at a major Wall Street firm, was the 
manager of product development and marketing of public, equity-linked corporate 
securities.&nbsp; He had a relatively secure position with competitive annual 
compensation, a large part of which was a bonus tied to his direct financial 
contribution and the overall performance of his firm.&nbsp; After 20 years of 
product development, travel, and security prospectus reviews, Peter realized 
that something was missing from his life.&nbsp; He wanted to spend more time 
with his family, outside interests were beckoning, and he was interested in 
being more involved with his community.&nbsp; In addition to these personal and 
family needs was a concern that his firm&rsquo;s underwriting business was 
eroding and his bonus was at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Peter decided to talk with 
others about possibly leaving his Wall Street position. He was considering 
either a treasury position with a corporation or unleashing his entrepreneurial 
instincts and starting a new business.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he could not find 
anyone to speak with who had left Wall Street for a small business venture.
&nbsp;Unfamiliar with the requirements of starting a new business, Peter turned 
to his brother, who had the knowledge and industry expertise as a result of 
starting a successful manufacturing/ retailing chocolate enterprise nearly 
twenty years earlier.&nbsp; Peter studied the trends in the chocolate industry 
and the local competition. He then created a detailed business plan outlining 
the initial capital needs as well as five year forecasted sales and expenses 
for an innovative chocolate manufacturing/retailing enterprise.&nbsp; It was 
Peter&rsquo;s hope that this venture would allow him to take his life in a new 
direction and still meet the financial needs of his growing family.&nbsp; Peter 
weighed the financial costs of leaving his lucrative position versus the 
non-financial return of spending more time with his family and pursuing outside 
interests.&nbsp; The setting is Manhattan and northern New Jersey during the 
late 1990s.</p> The author developed the case for class discussion rather than

REALIZING VALUE FROM MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS: OXIGENE, INC. <br>
<strong>
Mark J. Ahn, David Ackerley &amp; Rebecca Bednarek,</strong><strong>Victoria 
University of Wellington</strong><strong>Anne York, Creighton University
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
This case is set in the biopharmaceutical industry, 
which is fundamentally about creating innovative medicines and exploiting the 
finite period of intellectual property exclusivity. Key industry pressures 
include the rate of patent expirations on current product portfolios, a decline 
in research &amp; development productivity,generic substitution, and decreasing 
effective exclusivity periods. This case illustrates the promise and perils of 
managing an early, development stage biotechnology company that seeks to 
advance novel technologies, obtain financing, and alliances with larger 
multinational biopharmaceutical companies.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Oxigene is a development stage, biopharmaceutical company 
developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases. This case 
follows Dr. Richard Chin, CEO of Oxigene, as he faces the key strategic 
challenge of positioning the firm&rsquo;s technology platform and products, 
while seeking additional investment capital and external alliances. At issue 
was that Oxigene developed a technology platform with multiple product 
applications, each of which required significant resources. &ldquo;Wall 
Street,&rdquo; however, solely valued the company on its lead oncology product, 
Zybrestat, and seemingly did not impute any value to its other ophthalmology 
pipeline candidates. The case frames Chin and Oxigene&rsquo;s strategic options 
&mdash; continue to diversify from oncology to ophthalmology, spin off their 
ophthalmology product candidates into a new company, or license their 
ophthalmology another company (e.g., small biotech, large multinational 
biopharmaceutical).</p> The authors developed the case for class discussion 
rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of the

REARDON PALLET COMPANY 
&#150; SUSTAINING GROWTH <br>
<strong>Marilyn L. Taylor &amp; Nick Grunauer, 
University of Missouri at Kansas City</strong><strong>Chi Anyansi-Archibong, 
North Carolina A&amp;T State University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case is useful for demonstrating how financial investments decisions 
are often decisions about strategic changes or signal strategy changes to 
competitors and customers. The case can be used in Strategic Management, 
Entrepreneurship, and Small Business classes.&nbsp; The Instructor&rsquo;s 
Manual has been primarily targeted for Strategic Management Classes. The 
product technology for the company is reasonably simple and, at the graduate 
level especially, the case could be used for an introductory class in which 
students are led to focus more broadly than &ldquo;on the numbers&rdquo;.&nbsp; 
However, to utilize the case to its maximum potential, the authors recommend it 
be used later in the course.&nbsp; Concepts that can be used in the analysis 
include: SWOTs, Value Chain, PEST (+G), Cost-Benefit analysis, and Force Field 
analysis.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;Reardon Pallet Company &ndash; Building Success&rdquo; case 
focuses on this fast growth firm in 2008 after a consultant&rsquo;s 
presentation regarding two potential investments --- an automatic nailer 
machine and options for heat treating the lumber and/or manufactured pallets.
&nbsp;The case the two options for investment along with dimensions of the 
company (company history and personnel and culture) and industry (structure, 
technology, consolidation, and government regulations and tariffs).&nbsp; </p> 
&nbsp; 
<p>Dan, Sr. and 29-year-old son Daniel will have to make decisions regarding 
the investments.&nbsp; Although the decisions can be delayed, the 
company&rsquo;s growth is likely to ceiling shortly.&nbsp; Dan has been 
positioning the company for growth since inception and both father and son are 
committed to growth. Dan&rsquo;s strategic and organizational choices since he 
founded the company have been witness to his drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
decisions about the nailer and the heat treatment systems relate not only 
financial risk for the company, but more importantly long term how the company 
should position itself strategically.&nbsp; Making the investments soon will 
signal to competitors and customers that Reardon intends to be an even more 
aggressive player in the market.&nbsp; The firm has enjoyed fast-paced 
profitable growth.&nbsp; Dan expects the firm to be debt-free by the end of the 
year except for normal short-term payables.&nbsp; Should Dan make the 
investments?&nbsp; And, if so, in what time frame?</p>

RIVER BEND TRADING: TURN 
IT AROUND OR GO DOWN <br>
<strong>Tom Hinthorne &amp; Patricia Holman</strong> 
<p><strong>Montana State University-Billings</strong></p> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The case should enable students to: (1) Learn how to manage a turnaround 
strategy &ndash; retrenchment and recovery.&nbsp; (2) Think holistically and 
creatively in a failing business situation.&nbsp; (3) Realize the importance of 
being able to understand the financial statements and to use them to manage the 
business daily.&nbsp; (4) Appreciate the risks and personal sacrifices inherent 
in owning a small business, and (5) Understand the risks associated with having 
a major supplier who retrenches.&nbsp; The case writers developed the case for 
undergraduate Business Strategy or Small Business Management and 
Entrepreneurship courses.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The case features River Bend Trading, a small retail gift and apparel 
business in Columbus, Montana, population 2,000.&nbsp; Lois and Mary (M&amp;L) 
started the business in 1997.&nbsp; In 2000, they moved to a more attractive 
location.&nbsp; They also agreed to manage the adjacent Montana Silversmiths 
Outlet, which sold silver jewelry, rodeo trophy buckles, and other western 
products.&nbsp; The outlet&rsquo;s sales doubled M&amp;L&rsquo;s sales, and 
both businesses prospered.&nbsp; In 2007, Montana Silversmiths decided to 
manage the outlet and revoked M&amp;L&rsquo;s right to sell its products.&nbsp; 
With the onset of the recession in 2007, both firms found themselves struggling 
to survive.&nbsp; With the loss of the Montana Silversmiths business, River 
Bend Trading became a one-owner business.&nbsp; </p> &nbsp; In November 2008, 
Mary exited the business taking her share of the debt.&nbsp; By then, local 
firms were closing, and River Bend Trading&rsquo;s sales were declining.&nbsp; 
By February 2009, Lois was desperate.&nbsp; However, she had cost and asset 
reduction options and friends who were supportive and gave her advice.&nbsp; The
Small Business Administration was unfolding President Obama&rsquo;s&nbsp; ARC 
Loan Program, which appeared to offer some welcome financial assistance.&nbsp; 
A friend told her to develop a turnaround strategy, including a retrenchment 
plan (i.e., cost and asset reductions) and a recovery plan (i.e., a strategy 
for recovery).&nbsp; The case challenges students to develop a retrenchment 
strategy, a common business experience.

SHARPLIN 
HOSPITALITY, INC. <br>
<strong>Arthur Sharplin</strong><strong>Bentley 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case describes a Louisiana family&rsquo;s highly 
profitable motel business which appeared to be at a crossroads. Jerry Sharplin 
and his family needed urgently to decide whether to keep the firm together, to 
sell one or more of its three motels to outsiders, or to sell them to one or 
more of the three siblings who, with their father and mother, were 
owner-executives and directors of the firm.&nbsp; If the properties were to be 
sold, what might be appropriate prices and terms?&nbsp; If the company were to 
be kept together, how might the behavioral conflicts be managed, especially in 
terms of fair pay and work demands?&nbsp; The case is applicable to strategic 
management, entrepreneurship, hospitality, and small business classes but 
contains financial and behavioral data sufficient to provoke lively debate in 
finance or behavior classes.&nbsp; It is designed for analysis by upper 
division and graduate students, or in executive development programs.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Irascible Louisiana blacksmith artist/man of many 
functions Jerry Sharplin wanted to retire from the lodging business he had 
built from scratch. But his plan to turn the hotels over to his volatile 
offspring kept going awry.&nbsp; The elder son, 35 in 2009, had worked himself 
into a position of ascendancy over a younger brother and sister, earning almost 
twice their salary while reaping large financial benefits otherwise and 
claiming to have sacrificed to keep the family together.&nbsp; Angry because he 
could not acquire one of the motels and strike out on his own, the younger 
brother made plans to attend law school, while expecting to keep his stock 
ownership and salary and admitting that his already weak motivation might 
suffer yet further. Meanwhile, their sister, with the titles of Controller and 
Secretary, was taking a lackadaisical attitude toward the financial control 
system which it was her supposed duty to administer. A 2008 restructuring, 
which brought the three closer to parity, was viewed as unfair by all three, 
who claimed to think that they had given their parents undeserved share 
ownership. As the business benefited from a huge upsurge in patronage due to 
development of a large natural gas field in the area, profits escalated and the 
conflicts worsened. Jerry&rsquo;s frustration with the situation was evident as 
he threw an expensive theodolite against a tree, destroying the device.&nbsp; 
The Godfather of the younger son, was seen at times as a meddling uncle.</p>

TERAHERTZ SOLUTIONS INC. <br>
<strong>Dennis Callaghan, Elizabeth 
Croft, &amp; Robert Ellis</strong><strong>University of Northern British 
Columbia</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case was designed to illustrate the challenges in commercializing a 
new technology in very difficult economic and financial circumstances.&nbsp; 
The case would be appropriate for senior undergraduate and graduate courses in 
Entrepreneurship or Strategy.&nbsp; The case is suited for presentations in the 
classroom, as the principal character was struggling with the presentation that 
he should make to the jury in the New Ventures BC competition.&nbsp; The 
specific learning objectives for the case are: 1) To understand the 
complexities of transferring research findings from a university laboratory to 
commercial applications in industry; and 2) To develop skills in making a 
persuasive presentation on a new business venture to venture capitalists, 
bankers and CEOs who could potentially provide support.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Dr. Matt Reid was definitely outside of his comfort zone!&nbsp; The 
professor of Physics was most comfortable in the lab studying the optics of 
surfaces and discussing the findings with graduate students and fellow 
researchers across Canada.&nbsp; Tomorrow he would fly to Vancouver to make a 
presentation to a jury of venture capitalists, bankers and CEOs as a finalist 
in the New Venture BC Competition on the commercial viability of a new 
technology.&nbsp; The fledgling company he had founded desperately needed money 
to move the technology from the laboratory to commercial applications.&nbsp; 
Reid was one of the leading researchers in the world exploring the potential of 
terahertz radiation for imaging and measuring the properties of materials.&nbsp;
Reid had decided to pursue the possible uses of terahertz technology for 
increasing efficiency and quality in the processing of forest products, British 
Columbia&rsquo;s largest industry.&nbsp; Reid&rsquo;s challenge was to explain 
this new technology in a comprehensible fashion and to convince the jury of the 
economic viability of applying this technology to the forest industry.</p>

THE VITAL SPOT <br>
<strong>Richard Gifford &amp; 
Peter Markulis</strong><strong>State University of New York - Geneseo</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>about 6,000 residents and is somewhat of a bedroom community from a large 
city 35 miles away.&nbsp; The college is located in the heart of the town (or 
village) and has a student population of about 5,600 students, many of whom are 
residential students.&nbsp; The village has 6 bars, all of which are within 
walking distance of the college.&nbsp; Recently, the college has begun to 
attract a type of student who apparently is less inclined to frequent the bars 
as much as students in the past.&nbsp; Most of the bars have experienced a 
slight decline in revenues from students over the past two years.&nbsp; One of 
the bars, the Vital Spot is trying to decide whether should begin to change its 
appeal from college students to local residents.&nbsp; The owner believes the 
community is growing and since there is no &ldquo;sports&rdquo; bar locally, it 
could move in that direction.&nbsp; The case is primarily aimed at business 
undergraduate in small business management/entrepreneurship courses or 
strategic management.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
Paul and Luke DeVelder are the owner/operators of the 
Vital Spot, a college town bar.&nbsp; The bar is located in a town (or village) 
of roughly 6000 residents and a college of 5600 mostly residential students.
&nbsp;The town is about 35 miles from a large city and many of the residents 
commute daily to the city for work.&nbsp; In the last several years, the 
college has been able to attract a quality academic student.&nbsp; In 2008, the 
average SAT score of entering freshman was 1320.&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of 
the college is very proud of this and believes that this type of student will 
be less likely to frequent the bars.&nbsp; It should be noted that the bars are 
all within walking distance of the college, which means that drunk driving, is 
generally not an issue.&nbsp; There are 7 establishments in the town itself 
which serve alcohol.&nbsp; Of these, 4 (including the Vital Spot) are 
considered to be &lsquo;college&rsquo; bars.&nbsp; In the last two years, the 
Vital (as it&rsquo;s called)&mdash;along with the other college bars, have 
experienced a decline in revenues from student customers (so, perhaps, the 
president is correct?)&nbsp; While college bars have tried various tactics to 
attract more students, which often means pulling students away from 
competitors, Paul and Luke feel that there may be an opportunity to change the 
nature of their bar to attract local residents.&nbsp; The case describes their 
efforts to do so, given the nature of the other two bars in town which consider 
themselves to be &ldquo;townie&rdquo; bars.&nbsp; Paul &amp; Luke also have 
considered closing the bar.&nbsp; They feel the college has been on the 
&ldquo;warpath&rdquo; against the local bars with all kinds of programs 
designed to keep students away from the bars, especially during weeknights.</p>

<br> A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF WATERLESS URINALS TOWARDS AN ECO-STRATEGY <br>

<strong>Eugene Allevato &amp; Ashley Burrowes, Woodbury University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
Decision-making to meet the 21st Century&rsquo;s 
challenges in regards to building a sustainable society includes scrutinizing 
every aspect of human activity. The purpose of this case study is to present 
students enough information to make a decision on water conservation, more 
specifically in respect to the question of clean drinking water wasted to flush 
urinals. The case illustrates the importance of environmental, economic, 
cultural and political perspectives in the decision making process. It seems 
that environmental and economical concerns have generated much heated debate on 
an eco-engineering wonder, the waterless urinal; and the traditional urinal, 
which has its loyal followers that insist on resisting change and innovation. 
Certainly the concept of waterless urinals is new, and both cultural and 
technological barriers will be challenging. The relevance of a cost-benefit 
analysis is presented as a decision tool. The case was written for business 
school courses where decision-making processes, cost-benefit analyses and 
capital budgeting are studied.<br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
It is imperative that water management be analyzed at all 
levels, not only from its consumption perspective but also from its complete 
journey after the discharge. Innovative water conservation measures are in 
demand and last April the Department of Water Resources announced estimates of 
a record low for 2009 since this is the third consecutive dry year. On February 
27, 2009 Governor Schwarzenegger proclaimed a state of emergency due to drought 
conditions. In a letter to the Governor on March 30, 2009, Lester Snow, 
director of the department of water resources, declared that strategies have 
been implemented to provide assistance to those areas in need. Some of these 
strategies include the amount of $180 million in bond funds this year for 
drought relief to assist water management projects, legislation to reduce 
per-capita water usage, public education programs, finalized standards for 
recycling water, preparation of a contingency plan, and the preparation of 
status reports. In the case of urinals, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated 
the use of low flush urinals that use less than 1 gallon to conserve water. 
However, new technology includes a more efficient option; the waterless urinals 
which are now in use in many facilities and can save millions of gallons of 
water annually. The question is not whether there will be discharge or not but 
whether to flush or not to flush. As a result of that decision, 40,000 gallons 
of water per unit per year may be conserved, a significant amount considering 
the current drought. In addition, considering that from all bodies of water 
left only 2.5 percent is freshwater, which must be shared by 6 billion people, 
it sounds crazy that we are still flushing down urinals with about a gallon of 
drinking water.&nbsp; What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the ecological 
impact?&nbsp; What is the cost-benefit advantage of the waterless urinal? Why 
are we still using conventional urinals?</p> The authors developed the case for

CABARETE AND THE FIGHT FOR 
SUSTAINABILITY <br>
<strong>Ashley Allen, Sarah Margaret Davis, Kinsey 
Fletcher, Anne Elise Robertson,</strong><strong>Baylor University</strong>
<strong>Marlene M. Reed, Baylor University, Faculty Supervisor</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case recounts the dilemma of business owners of a small tourist town 
named Cabarete on the northern shore of the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; The 
business owners were concerned about foreign investors building high-rise 
condominiums in the village which might impair the wind in the area which 
supported one of the most popular wind sport destinations in the Caribbean.
&nbsp;The material covered in the case is designed to help students explore the 
concept of sustainability and what it means not only for the businesses in the 
area, but also for the environment and communities in which they exist.&nbsp; 
This case could be used in a number of undergraduate-level courses.&nbsp; It 
would fit most appropriately in a strategic management course during 
discussions of corporate social responsibility or competitive advantage.&nbsp; 
The case could also be used in courses in ethics, entrepreneurship, and 
hospitality management.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>The city of Cabarete, a popular tourist destination on the northern coast 
of the Dominican Republic, was struggling to resist change that might harm 
local business owners.&nbsp; Foreign investors planned to build high rise 
condominiums and apartments that would draw tourists away from the local 
vendors.&nbsp; The high rise buildings that the investors planned to build 
might also present a threat to the unique wind pattern for which Cabarete was 
known.&nbsp; As a result, the local business owners had been forced to take 
action.&nbsp; Their first step was to form a committee called the Federation 
for a Sustainable Cabarete.&nbsp; Although the committee had been active in 
meeting with numerous government officials, it had not been successful in 
preventing investors from building in the city.&nbsp; Keeping in mind the

DON FRANCIS AND THE QUEST FOR AN AIDS VACCINE <br>
<strong>
Wartini Pramana &amp; Emmanuel Raufflet, HEC Montr&eacute;al</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>The purpose of this case is three-fold.&nbsp; First, it is to portray the 
trajectory of Don Francis, a scientist, an advocate, and a social entrepreneur 
in the meanders of the public, private and non-profit sectors in the quest for 
the an AIDS Vaccine.&nbsp; Second, it aims at exposing students to scientific, 
political, and economic complexities in addressing such a controversial but 
deadly disease like AIDS.&nbsp;Third, this case aims at raising awareness to 
the students about the role of philanthropy in bringing global social justice 
and access to healthcare.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
This case is about the story of Don Francis, a pioneer 
and more than 20 years of activist in the field of AIDS, especially in the 
development of AIDS vaccine<strong>. </strong><strong>It</strong> concentrates 
on three issues: (1) the personal trajectory of Don Francis as a social 
entrepreneur in the public, private, and non-profit sectors; (2) influencing 
factors to discovery of AIDS vaccine, which has a large proportion of 
beneficiaries in poor countries; and (3) the changing environment for 
addressing the global health issues.<strong></strong>&nbsp;Don Francis is one 
of most important figures in keeping the hope for finding AIDS vaccine alive in 
spite of various challenges that have become obstacles in the discovery of the 
vaccine since his first collaboration with Luc Montagnier of Pasteur Institute 
in 1984.&nbsp; The challenges come from the scientific/technical aspect of AIDS 
vaccine research, social value on curative rather preventive measure,lack of a 
coordinated scientific strategy, competition rather than collaboration among 
research groups, low interest by industry and the government of rich countries 
in investing in vaccine research and generally inadequate funding for the 
enormous task at hand<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to his continuing 
passion for finding AIDS vaccine, among his other legacies are the standard 
components of AIDS Control Program that are currently applied around the world: 
(a) Voluntary and Counselling Testing/VCT Center for AIDS, (b) blood screening 
by blood banks and (c) sex education.&nbsp; The world also owes it to him for 
elimination of smallpox from the face of the earth in the 1970s, control of 
ebola epidemic outbreak in 1976 in the border region between Zaire and Sudan; 
and discovery of hepatitis vaccine in 1980s in the USA.</p> The authors 
developed the case for class discussion rather than to illustrate either 
effective or ineffective handling of the situation. The case,

FREE STORE FOOD BANK OF CINCINNATI: 
LIBERTY PANTRY PRODUCTS <br>
<strong>Brett R. Smith &amp; David W. Rosenthal, 
Miami University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case addresses the concepts of social entrepreneurship in the 
environment of hunger in America.&nbsp; The Free Store Food Bank of Cincinnati 
(FSFB) is one of 205 food banks across the United States.&nbsp; Each of these 
organizations collects food which it then distributes to the needy and hungry.
&nbsp;The case demonstrates conflicts in organizational goals and end-user 
values, in this instance maximizing nutrition versus consumer tastes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The question also arises; is it more appropriate to use a business 
model based on marketing principles or production efficiencies in a charitable, 
not-for-profit environment?&nbsp; The case draws upon traditional 
entrepreneurship theory to examine the opportunity, the team, and the resources 
as they relate to a new product offering.&nbsp; The role of social enterprise a 
nonprofit organization is explored, in that FSFB hopes to generate a revenue 
stream to be applied to other programs.&nbsp; Finally, the balance of 
escalating commitment and the challenges of terminating entrepreneurial 
pursuits is considered as the leaders must decide how to position the right 
product with the right market segment or whether to discontinue the concept 
altogether.&nbsp; The case is intended for use in undergraduate marketing, 
entrepreneur-ship or social entrepreneurship courses.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>In June, 2009 the leaders of the Free Store Food Bank of Cincinnati (FSFB), 
were uncertain about future plans for the Liberty Pantry product line.&nbsp; 
The Liberty Pantry products were freeze-dried foods, high in nutrition, 
especially protein, and low in cost per serving.&nbsp; The Liberty Pantry 
concept offered the prospect of balancing uneven food supply, generating 
additional revenues and feeding more hungry people.&nbsp; Despite the obvious 
benefits, the products had generated limited demand.&nbsp; Recent market 
research provided detail regarding unenthusiastic consumer and channel 
reactions.</p> 
<p>Breedlove Foods, Inc. produced the line of products in freeze-dried form, 
packaged in sealed plastic pouches. Their market had been international relief 
programs.&nbsp; FSFB had obtained the rights to distribute the products in the 
eastern half of the United States.&nbsp; The idea was to provide low cost, high 
nutrition products to their member agencies, other food banks across the 
country and potentially retail stores. The overriding question that FSFB 
leaders faced involved three fundamental options &ndash; reconfigure the end 
user product line, focus on the on-site feeding channel segment, or discontinue 
the Liberty Pantry product line.</p>

<br> GLOBAL INNOVATORS: FOUR COMPANIES WHICH WORKING TO IMPROVE SOCIAL 
CONDITIONS AROUND THE WORLD <br>
<strong>Robert Girling, Sonoma State University
</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
Around the world innovative enterprises are emerging 
daily to combine the energies of social concern with the logic of the 
marketplace to meet the needs of millions worldwide and to meetthe failure of 
the market to solve growing social problems&mdash;such as health care, urban 
decay and poverty. For example, lifesaving drugs to treat malaria, tuberculosis 
and Aids were created by for-profit pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp; But while 
they generate benefits to individuals, investors and society at large, a large 
subset of the world&rsquo;s population in need of their healing benefits cannot 
afford them.These four cases treat global social and ethical issues and 
concerns. As a result of globalization, the actions of companies and 
organizations reach around the world to distant and remote parts of the globe.
<br> </p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
What makes<em> </em><strong>Indigenous Designs</strong> 
different from other clothing producers is their commitment to social justice 
and environmental stewardship.&nbsp; From the beginning what distinguished 
<strong>Indigenous Designs</strong> was that the company&rsquo;s social 
commitment to lift a group of Andean women out of poverty.&nbsp; But the 
relationship was riddled with challenges.<strong>Aravind Eye Care</strong> is 
one of the most successful and admired enterprising nonprofits in the world.
&nbsp;It is a world class eye care system of clinics, institutes and 
manufacturing centers such as a center for manufacturing lenses in order to 
reduce the cost one of the main sources of expense. While the majority of 
surgeries are free, Aravind is financially self-supporting.<strong>Roots of 
Peace</strong> aim is to rid the world of landmines transforming treacherously 
toxic minefields into thriving farmland.&nbsp;It works in partnership with 
government agencies, private companies like Robert Mondavi winery, and 
universities such as UC-Davis.<strong>Benetech</strong> was founded as a 
&ldquo;low-profit&rdquo; company using a market approach to ensuring the 
development of technology. Benetech&rsquo;s focus is on high social value 
despite low potential for generating a typical market rate of return on 
investment.What makes these companies different and distinct? Are consumers 
sufficiently concerned about the working conditions under which goods are 
produced to support these companies? How do our decisions and the decisions of 
companies which we work for or where we shop impact others all around the 
globe? Can companies produce needed products and survive financially? What are 
the implications of these social enterprises for our teaching of business 
ethics?</p> The author developed the case for class discussion rather than to

GOOD 
WATER: STANDING ON HOLY GROUND <br>
<strong>Stephen Bowden &amp; Eva Collins, 
University of Waikato</strong><strong>Helen Tregidga &amp; Kate Kearins, 
Auckland University of Technology</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
The case has been specifically designed to foster 
discussion on the role of business in achieving wider social and environmental 
objectives (Hart &amp; Milstein, 2003; Hawken, 1993; Milne, Kearins &amp; 
Walton, 2006). It raises the possibility of sharing intellectual property and 
working with competitors, to promote catalytic innovation. It also raises 
fundamental issues about local sourcing, promoting consumption and managing 
resultant waste, as well as debate about how to effectively close the loop 
(McDonough &amp; Braungart, 2002).&nbsp;This case has been written for use in 
undergraduate and postgraduate classes in strategic management, social and 
environmental entrepreneurship, and environmental management and 
sustainability. The case has been class-room tested with a business and 
sustainability class using similar questions to those offered here. It has also 
been used in an undergraduate case competition.&nbsp; The case is primarily 
based on videoed class visits and tape-recorded interviews with Grant Hall in 
2008 and 2009, and on an analysis of documentation provided by Grant.&nbsp; <br>
</p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
By May 2009, New Zealand businessman and Good Water CEO, 
Grant Hall, was one year into his five year plan to achieve his nirvana vision 
of a closed loop system. He wanted to sell water in bottles made from local 
biomass, with the used bottle waste separated, up-cycled and allowed to 
biodegrade and support new plant-life and sources of biomass. To make his plan 
a reality, Good Water and competitors who took up the Good Water project 
challenge of producing in PLA bottles, needed to ramp up volume considerably. 
Doing so would create demand for a local biomass supply. Meanwhile, there were 
issues around bottled water creating a lot of plastic drink bottles that would 
generally be better being refilled at the tap, and waste separation in terms of 
its political acceptance and functional viability. The project was not without 
its problems or detractors. How should Grant develop his business, Good Water, 
and the wider Good Water project?</p> The authors developed the case for class 
discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling 
of the situation. The case, instructor&rsquo;s manual, and synopsis were 
anonymously peer reviewed and accepted by the North American Case Research 
Association (NACRA) for its annual meeting, Santa Cruz, October 29-31, 2009.

NOVICA: THE ARTS AND CRAFTS OF SOCIAL 
VENTURING <br>
<strong>Elissa Grossman &amp; David Y. Choi, Loyola Marymount 
University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case allows students to explore (1) the power of a mission statement 
when enacted as a true guide to organizational decision-making, and (2) the 
centrality of sound business fundamentals in the context of &ldquo;doing 
good.&rdquo; It also motivates consideration of the prerequisites for and 
possible paths to organizational growth &ndash; asking what sorts of growth 
strategies are appropriate and what criteria should be considered in making 
growth decisions. A key issue in the case concerns the business effectiveness 
derived through the alignment of organizational mission, business model, and 
operational infrastructure. This alignment facilitated the case company&rsquo;s 
success to date and will arguably be essential to continued growth and success. 
A secondary issue concerns the role played by a capable team. The case is 
designed for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in entrepreneurship, 
social entrepreneurship, and growth management.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
This case is about the emergence of an innovative 
for-profit social venture that connects talented artisans in developing nations 
with customers in the US and elsewhere. Though raised in the US, co-founders 
and lifelong friends Roberto Milk, Andy Milk, and Charles Hachtmann have always 
been exposed to global influences. All three grew up with parents or 
grandparents who hailed from other countries. All three traveled a great deal 
in their youth. All three were multilingual. Similarly, all three were 
surrounded by people who made it their lives&rsquo; mission to make a positive 
social contribution. When Roberto meets his future mother-in-law, Armenia 
Nercessian de Oliveira, a professor and United Nations employee who has 
dedicated her life to helping others across the globe, the stage is set for the 
introduction of a new business idea: NOVICA.While Roberto has an 
entrepreneurial vision about which he is passionate, he is also a thoughtful 
and patient leader. NOVICA&rsquo;s story is thus one of slow and steady 
emergence &ndash; in which Roberto first builds, over the course of a decade, 
an executive team comprised of his family and friends; then develops the most 
critical operational components of the organization; and finally scales the 
business to profit. The case ends with Roberto and his team facing a critical 
decision about how to at last propel the company from slow to rapid and 
substantial growth. By 2009, NOVICA has achieved significant success &ndash; 
reaching $15 million in annual revenue, helping better artisans&rsquo; lives 
worldwide, and retaining the tight-knit founding team of its earliest days. The 
founders, however, want NOVICA to be much more: a truly global presence, 
offering help in new parts of the world, in new ways, and earning $100 million 
annually.</p>

SONOMA WINE COMPANY: 
IDEAS FOR GENERATIONS <br>
<strong>Brian Kent &amp; Domenique Scioli, Sonoma 
State University</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case is used to showcase the greening methods of not only the 
California wine industry as a whole, but also of a specific winery, Sonoma Wine 
Company, who have been industry leaders in sustainability.&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Started in the late 1980&rsquo;s, a local activist group in the small town 
of Graton, (population 1,815) named Graton Association to Stop Pollution (GASP) 
came to the management team of Sonoma Wine Company with major concerns about 
the wastewater pond the winery was using. Under GASP&rsquo;s watch, Sonoma Wine 
Company took action to ensure that its wastewater pond, was, in short, cleaned 
up. Not only did Sonoma Wine Company accomplish this cleaning by rejuvenating 
its water pumps and aerators, but also put practices in place to ensure that 
the water flowing to the pond is as clean as possible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> &nbsp; 
<p>With its arrival in Graton, Sonoma Wine Company began to make major changes 
to its facilities and operations.&nbsp; The equipment was out of date, the 
layout was not very efficient, and the building constructed in 1947, was rather 
archaic.&nbsp; Proprietor Derek Benham knew that in order to increase market 
share, and provide better quality of service to his clients, changes would need 
to be made quickly.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>The Sonoma Wine Company management team of president Dennis Carroll, 
general manager Ed Silva, director of business development Natasha Granoff, and 
facility manager Jim Feely, decided that environmentally sound practices would 
need to be built into the facility plans.&nbsp; Sonoma Wine Company looked to 
many organizations and consultants to accomplish its long-term goals of 
increasing market share and capacity, while also reducing its energy costs and 
waste.</p>

SOUTHWEST CREATIONS COLLABORATIVE 
CASE A (1994-2005) &amp; CASE B (2005-2008) <br>
<strong>Jeanne M. Logsdon 
&amp; Jonathan N. Bundy</strong><strong>University of New Mexico</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case describes a successful social enterprise that combines a 
profit-making perspective with a social mission to help immigrant women achieve 
steady and dignified employment. Southwest Creations Collaborative (SCC) 
addresses the many social issues of low-income immigrants by creating 
employment and personal growth programs into one very successful non-profit 
model. In the context of its profit-making orientation, SCC raises questions 
about the theory of the firm and to whom an organization should be responsible. 
SCC&rsquo;s social entrepreneur, Susan Matteucci, has taken the position that 
an organization can exist to further the welfare of its employees. By improving 
employee welfare, SCC is also contributing to the larger community by 
alleviating poverty and by strengthening families. This case is designed for 
use in upper-level business school courses (either undergraduate or graduate) 
in social entrepreneurship, nonprofit management, business and society and 
strategic management.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Southwest Creations Collaborative (SCC) is a non-profit social enterprise 
organized to promote employability and enable the financial independence of 
immigrant Spanish-speaking women in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The mission is 
achieved through a combination of employment and personal growth opportunities. 
SCC is organized as a non-profit contract manufacturing business and provides 
full-time sewing and handwork jobs. SCC also provides numerous program 
activities for employees and for the community, including English lessons, 
childcare (employees only), and computer classes. Income is generated through a 
combination of contract work and grant funding.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>As a leading example of a successful social enterprise in the Albuquerque 
metropolitan area, SCC has become a pivotal member both the non-profit and 
manufacturing community. The two cases stretch through the life of SCC, from 
its inception in 1994 through mid-2008, when the case was written. Case A 
covers the initial formation of the organization in 1994 and culminates in a 
decision point regarding a possible relationship with a social venture 
consulting group in early 2005. Case B begins where Case A ends and concludes 
with a decision point to expand the business and become more economically 
self-sufficient and less reliant on grants and donations in mid-2008.</p>

THE MATA DE PALMA 
PROJECT: SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC <br>
<strong>Kristen 
Anzollitto, Nicole Hewitt, Lydia Rogers, Baylor University</strong><strong>
&amp; Emily Stroderd, Baylor University</strong><strong>Marlene M. Reed, Baylor 
University, Faculty Supervisor</strong> 
<p>Case Objective<br>
</p> 
<p>This case reveals the story of Omar Bros, a native of the Dominican 
Republic, and his desire to use a portion of his profits on a new semi-mobile 
ethanol mill to improve the standard of living of the impoverished Haitian 
immigrants who live in the Mata de Palma region of the Dominican Republic.&nbsp;
Bros had earlier developed the new technology employed in the mobile mill in 
order to move the mill closer to the fields of sugar cane where the processing 
into ethanol would begin.&nbsp; Although he had decided to use 30 percent of 
his profits to improve the citizens&rsquo; standard of living, he did not have 
a clear strategy for accomplishing this goal.&nbsp; The case deals with the 
challenges that he faced in accomplishing this goal and the development of a 
clear strategy for carrying out his purposes.&nbsp; The case was written for 
business school undergraduate courses in entrepreneurship, business strategy, 
and business and society.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Case Synopsis<br>
</p> 
<p>Omar Bros, a native Dominican, had a dream of using 30 percent of the 
profits from his new semi-mobile mill to improve the standard of living of the 
Haitian immigrants who lived in the slum areas known as &ldquo;bateyes&rdquo; 
in the Mata de Palma region of the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; The semi-mobile 
mill was developed to move the processing of sugar cane into ethanol closer to 
the fields where the sugar cane was grown.&nbsp; In so doing, Bros sought to 
revolutionize the sugar cane cultivation process using the latest technology.
&nbsp;It was his desire to improve the lives of these people economically, 
environmentally, and socially.&nbsp; The problem lay in how best to allocate 
the profits to create economic stability and improve the quality of life in the 
region.&nbsp; The end result of the Mata de Palma project was to create a 
self-sustaining economy supported by the demand for agricultural products and 
technological innovations of the mill.</p>
