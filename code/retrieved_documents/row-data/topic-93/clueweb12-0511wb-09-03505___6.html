<p>Is well water more or less likely to be affected than regular tap water?</p>

<p>a brita filter doesnt remove jack squat. I have a TDS meter and sometimes 
the TDS rating is higher than from the tap when I test culligan or brita 
filters. If you drink well water without RO + UV sanitizing you are making a 
huge mistake. Trust me I own a well, 5 stage RO +UV you can buy for about 
300-400 on amazon fukushima or not buy that!</p>

<h3> I lived in North Carolina </h3>  Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on

<p>I lived in North Carolina for 6 months back in 2007. We had a well but only 
bathed in the water we didn't drink it. Despite the fact that the water passed 
the inspection test I just didn't feel comfortable drinking it. Especially 
since those tests don't cover everything. After a couple of months there I 
started getting huge palm sized hives all over my torso. I was really miserable 
and had to get steroid shots to clear them up. I subsequently moved back to No 
cal for unrelated reasons but the hives stopped eventually. I'd never been 
allergic to anything except dust mites, and that was pretty mild compared to 
this. My Kaiser allergist was at a loss. She said it seemed like a drug allergy 
but I don't take anything that's known to cause allergic reactions. When this 
whole Fukushima thing went down I got curious about how far I've been living 
from nuclear reactors all my life. Low and behold my North Carolina home was 
within 20 miles of a nuclear plant. I don't know if that was the reason for my 
hives but I do know that our well water test didn't test for radiation. We did 
do a Radon test in the house inspection and the readings were average for the 
region. I should add that for two years after I moved back my hair fell out. 
Not hands full but more than a brush full every two days. My doctor said it was 
&quot;Effluvium&quot; and she, pardon the pun, brushed it off. I can't drive 
myself crazy thinking about this but I thought it might be interesting to share 
in this forum.</p>

<p>I lived in North Carolina once and the property had well water. Anywhow, I 
drank it and noticed a strange taste. I was later informed that the well could 
contain arsenic.<br>
 You need to check your well out for something like that.

<p>Thank you for quick reply....so I'm gathering my well water is pretty safe 
to drink considering the filtration that takes place as the rainwater travels 
thru the soil, rocks, etc.</p>

<p>I'm on well water, too, and have been wondering the same thing. I'm hoping 
that the soil filtration plus the Brita water filter I'm using will be enough 
to keep it safe. I really wish I could get it tested, though. Any other info 
anyone else can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>do brita water filters remove radiation? i hope so, since i already use 
one, but i do not know about it filtering out radiation.</p>

<h3> I've read that for radiation </h3>  Submitted by Anonymous (not verified)

<p>I've read that for radiation carbon filters like Brita and Pur can help but 
they're not as effective as reverse osmosis filters. It would be nice to have a 
clear answer on that, though. My well has a complicated filtration system on it 
itself as well for filtering out iron and other things, so I'm hoping all these 
things together (soil, well filter, Brita filter) are giving me water that's at 
least as safe as Berkeley tap water, which at last check is showing no 
detectable levels. That said, if the BRAWN team is interested in testing well 
water (and soil, too) from the Sierra foothills, I'd be happy to provide 
samples.</p>

<h3> Possibly, but it is hard to </h3>  Submitted by dchivers on Fri,

<p>Possibly, but it is hard to say. Well water is normally drawn from ground 
water which seeps down the soil from rainfall. We have found that the soil and 
rocks are an extremely good filter for these nuclides and I expect ground water 
supplies would have less contamination than just rain water run off. However, 
tap water is (e.g. from East Bay MUD) is normally pulled from the bottoms of 
large reservoirs in the Sierra (this is not always the case) and travel through 
closed aqueducts to a treatment facility then pumped to tanks that feed the tap 
supply. The source is the reservoir has a dilution factor based on how much 
water inventory was there before the event and how much contaminated rain fell 
in the immediate area. Further, we have found that the runoff is very much 
diluted relative to pure rain water so most of the reservoir water that comes 
from runoff is already diluted from soil filtering. This is the picture that is 
emerging from our data.</p>
