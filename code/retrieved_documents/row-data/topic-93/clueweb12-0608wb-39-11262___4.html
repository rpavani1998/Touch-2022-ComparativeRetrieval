<p> Q: About making purified water.<br>
<br>
<br>
Utricularia inflata A: Pure 
water is essential for your carnivorous plants, because that is what they are 
adapted to in their wetland habitats. The tap water or well water in most 
houses contains too many chemicals, including calcium. Over time, these 
chemicals can kill your carnivorous plants or at the very least force you to 
repot more frequently because your planting medium is decomposing.<br>
<br>
 
Here are several ways that you can try to make purified water. Most of these 
ways have been cooked up by people who do not know what they are talking about. 
The unsuccessful ways are pretty funny to me. Too bad they kill plants.<br>
<br>
Ways that do not work<br>
<br>
<br>
Aldrovanda<br>
 vesiculosa 1)Letting water 
stand overnight in a pan or bucket<br>
 And what, precisely, is supposed to 
happen? Little water purification pixies will visit? I tell you what. Take a 
pan of water, put a dead rat in it and wait overnight. Next day I bet that rat 
is still there. Allowing water to stand overnight may allow some volatile 
chemicals to evaporate, but most of the things that will kill your carnivorous 
plants will still remain.<br>
<br>
 I think this method evolved from the 
aquarium trade, supposedly as a valid method to get chlorine out of municipal 
tap water before using it in a fish tank. But does this work even for this 
case? Unfortunately, since there are no explosives involved, I doubt 
MythBusters will cover this one.<br>
<br>
2)Boil the water for a while<br>
 
Other than ensuring your plants will not get dysentery, this will not do 
anything. You are trying to remove ions from the water, not organisms. Boiling 
may (<em>may</em>) drive off chlorine, but nothing else of importance. That 
dead rat will still be in the pot after you boil it. Boiled saltwater is still 
saltwater, and if anything is slightly more concentrated than before you boiled 
it!<br>
<br>
3)Use coffee or &quot;Brita&quot; style pour-through filters<br>
 
I do not know what these things do exactly, but I have tried a few experiments 
and found that they do not stop the salts that would accumulate and eventually 
kill your plants.<br>
<br>
Ways that <em>may</em> work<br>
<br>
<br>
Pinguicula 
macroceras 1)Getting water right out of the tap<br>
 Some people live in places 
where the tap water or well water is gloriously pure and unprocessed. If you 
boil about 4 liters (1 gallon) of your tap water until it is completely gone, 
and see no white residue on the bottom of your pan, maybe you can use tapwater 
on your carnivorous plants!<br>
<br>
2)Collect rain water<br>
 I used to do 
this. It was a serious pain in the bum. I would hose off my greenhouse before 
each storm to get the crud off it. I had a complicated system of gutters set up 
to guide the water into a big barrel. After each rain, the water still had all 
sorts of dust and stuff in it. I gave up after a while. If you collect 
rainwater off the roof of your house, do you have nasty tar shingles up there? 
I bet they would leach chemicals into your water. On the other hand, I had a 
friend in Tucson, Arizona, who had his own complicated system of gutters on his 
house, a couple of big storage tanks, and an interesting set of water pumps. He 
gathered all the water he needed this way.Sphagnum moss did not survive well in 
his greenhouse, and dead sphagnum fiber seemed to break down faster than 
normal, but other than that his plants did great.<br>
<br>
 Another person 
e-mailed me from the British moorlands to tell me that he gathered rainwater 
and it worked just fine. Good for him. And good for you if you share his luck.
<br><br>
3)Collect water from cooling units<br>
 Some people collect 
condensation water from their refrigerators. This is a pain in the bum, too. 
But it might work.<br>
<br>
<br>
 South Carolina 4)Make and operate a solar 
still<br>
 You could follow this route, as one FAQ-reader reminded me. However, 
I think that it would take a lot of tinkering. You would also want to keep the 
still fairly isolated from its surroundings so it would not get contaminated by 
airborne dust, acid rain, dog pee, or anything else that would degrade your 
water quality. I am sure there must be instructions on the web about how to 
make one, especially with all the nutty survivalists out there. (If you are a 
nutty survivalist, please do not take offense at my comments.) (Note to the 
non-survivalist FAQ-readers---you have to be careful about offending nutty 
survivalists---they can be nutty AND scary.)<br>
<br>
Ways that <em>do</em> work
<br> <br>
1)Get and maintain distiller or reverse osmosis unit<br>
