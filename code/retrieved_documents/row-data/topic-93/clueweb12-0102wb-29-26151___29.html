<h3>  What&rsquo;s the truth about your water? </h3> 
<p>Thursday, September 8th, 2011</p> 
<p>Categories: Bottled Water,Contaminants in Drinking Water,Environment,
Healthy Living,Methods of Filtration,Tips for Health</p> 
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not <em>JUST</em> water</strong></p> 
<p>We can all remember the days of high school chemistry class and learning 
the basic components of water, H2O: 2 hydrogen molecules attached to 1 oxygen 
molecule. You may also remember that our bodies are composed of 70%-80% water 
and we must drink enough of it to survive. Today we face major problems 
regarding safe drinking water, not only because of mass contamination from 
environmental and synthetic chemicals, but an even bigger problem is growing 
due to corporate and governmental control of our bottled water system. We are 
being forced to buy more bottled water than ever and the only people who 
benefit are the big corporations who mass produce this highly consumed product. 
It&rsquo;s not easy to find clean, affordable drinking water but there are 
things that we can do.</p> 
<p><strong>Contaminants</strong></p> 
<p>The EPA has set standards for more than 80 contaminants that may occur in 
drinking water and pose a risk to human health. The EPA claims its standards 
protect the health of everybody, including vulnerable groups like children. Is 
there really a safe standard when it comes to drinking toxins? And, what 
happened to the countless<em>other</em> contaminants found in our drinking 
water? According to the Environmental Working Group&rsquo;s (EWG&rsquo;s) 
two-and-a-half year investigation, tap water in 42 states is contaminated with 
more than 140 unregulated chemicals that lack safety standards. In an analysis 
of more than 22 million tap water quality tests, most of which were required 
under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, EWG found that water suppliers 
across the U.S. detected 260 contaminants in water served to the public. One 
hundred forty-one (141) of these detected chemicals &mdash; more than half 
&mdash; are unregulated; public health officials have not set safety standards 
for these chemicals, even though millions drink them every day.</p> 
<p>According to the EPA, contaminants fall into two groups based on the health 
effects that they cause. Acute effects occur within hours or days of the time 
that a person consumes a contaminant. Chronic effects occur after people 
consume a contaminant at levels over EPA&rsquo;s safety standards for many 
years. The drinking water contaminants that can have chronic effects are 
chemicals (such as disinfection by-products, solvents, and pesticides), 
radionuclides (such as radium), and minerals (such as arsenic). Examples of the 
chronic effects of drinking water contaminants are cancer, liver or kidney 
problems, or reproductive difficulties.</p> 
<p>Go here for more information. </p> 
<p><strong>The bottled water scam</strong></p> 
<p>With so many of us becoming aware of our contaminated tap water, the world 
is embracing the bottled water industry like never before. In 1999 the sales of 
bottled water in the US was around $6 billion in one year. By 2007 the sales of 
bottled water jumped to over $11 billion. Some believe that drinking bottled 
water is no more pure or better for your health, nor is it safer than community 
or municipal water. The purity standards for bottled water are no higher than 
those applied to tap water &mdash; in some instances they are lower or less 
rigorous. Studies have shown that chemicals called phthalates, which are known 
to disrupt testosterone and other hormones, can leach into bottled water over 
time. There are no regulatory standards limiting phthalates in bottled water. 
The bottled water industry waged a successful campaign opposing the FDA 
proposal to set a legal limit for these chemicals.</p> 
<p>Go here for more information.</p> 
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p> 
<p>The majority of the contaminants found in our drinking water can be traced 
back to improper or excessive use of ordinary compounds like lawn chemicals, 
gasoline, cleaning products and even prescription drugs. As a consumer, you 
might consider buying eco-friendly cleaners, avoid using toxic toiletries, and 
dispose of your medications properly. By doing your part in creating a less 
toxic environment, we will be able to create safer water for generations to 
come.</p> 
<p>The benefits of bottled water are convenience and novelty. Instead of 
buying bottled water you can carry a canteen or a reusable athletic bottle. My 
personal favorite is to use a glass bottle and filter the water at home using a 
water filter. It is good for the environment and lowers the risk of chemical 
exposure such as BPA, a common toxic chemical in plastics. This change will 
save you a lot of money and will help the environment because water bottles are 
one of the major sources of plastic going into landfills today. Shipping 
billions of gallons of water every year also uses a lot of fuel.</p> 
<p>Lastly, recycle empty water bottles, <em>EVERYTIME!</em> And don&rsquo;t 
<em>WASTE</em> your water by letting the shower or faucet run. Use old water 
for things like watering plants and invest in water saving devices for you 
home. Be a responsible and conscious water consumer. We will all benefit from 
it.</p>

<h3>  5 Interior Design Ideas to Update Your Kitchen (on a budget!) </h3> 
<p>Monday, May 23rd, 2011</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Contaminants in Drinking Water,Healthy 
Living,Tips for Health</p> 
<p>We all want to upgrade and beautify our homes, but the problem with making 
changes these days comes down to two key facts:money is scarce and tastes 
change. High-contrast color kitchens are trendy this year (lime green and stark 
white, purple and white), but may not always be. Chrome and black appliances 
are all the rage, as are granite counters and reclaimed wood cabinets. Some 
people are also really into making healthy and/or &ldquo;green&rdquo; changes, 
trying to make their spaces beautiful and functional in a way the supports 
long-term sustainability and health goals. You know what they say about diets: 
if you want to eat more healthy, stock your kitchen with healthy food, not 
junk. The same idea can apply to your home: if you make it easier to be good, 
you will be good more often. And we start the being &ldquo;good&rdquo; by not 
over-reaching our budgets. Living within your means is the hottest new fashion, 
and we certainly want to promote that!</p> 
<p>This year, forgo the massive remodel, and opt to give your kitchen a face 
lift instead.</p> 
<p>Repaint/stain your cabinets with VOC-free paint or stain, of course. Unless 
your cabinets are just falling apart at the seams, you can probably get away 
with simply giving them a good hard scrub and a layer ofpaint or re-staining 
them. The new look will make you see the space with fresh eyes, trust me!</p> 
<p>Get a sink-mounted water filter. (I know, please forgive the plug.) 
You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard the recent clarion call to abandon our national 
love affair with bottled water; the concerns that inform this trend are real 
and incredibly sobering, and we&rsquo;ve covered them inother blog articles. 
But to get the healthiest water, you need to filter what you drink (and bathe 
in). And for those of you who really want the convenience of a water filter 
spout in your kitchen, but don&rsquo;t want to sacrifice your kitchen&rsquo;s 
feng shui, we have seven different finishes just for you!</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Consider green lighting options. Some older kitchens still have overhead 
fluorescent bar lights. Yuck. Aren&rsquo;t we a bit too old and discerning for 
that? We don&rsquo;t all have the budget to add a new skylight (which would be 
the ideal green kitchen lighting) butyou have options to make a few changes to 
the illumination in your kitchen, save some energy and update the look all in 
one swoop. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the difference good lighting can make.</p> 
<p>Look into sustainable countertops. There are a number of sustainable, 
affordable options out there if you&rsquo;re into getting new countertops. 
There are the reclaimed wood and recycled paper varieties likePaperStone and 
EcoTop. Recycled glass counters likeVetrazzo, EnviroGLAS and EnviroSLAB. 
Ceramic tile can be a good option if you take care when shopping (look for 
tiles made from recycled material) and use a low-VOC adhesive to lay the tile.
</p> 
<p>Invest in energy star appliances. You can get some really good models of 
fridges, microwaves, dishwashers, ovens and stoves out there that look great, 
don&rsquo;t cost a ton, and can save you money on your house bills in the long 
run (and some even come with local or even national rebates for going green!). 
Make sure they rate well and save lots of energy (some models only barely save 
you enough to be consideredEnergy Star compliant, and I&rsquo;ve avoid those), 
and recycle your old appliances with your local municipality (or donate them to 
Goodwill).</p> 
<p>What are you doing to your kitchen this summer to improve how it looks and 
functions? Send us pics onFacebook and Twitter!</p> 
<p>Up next time: redo your bathroom with a few key additions or changes and 
give it a whole new look and feel.</p>

<h3>  3 Major Ways to Detox Your Life in 2011 </h3> 
<p>Thursday, January 27th, 2011</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Healthy Living,Tips for Health</p> 
<p>Detoxing your life means more than just losing that holiday weight or 
nixing the caffeine. It&rsquo;s a good idea to examine all aspects of your life 
to uncover places you can cut down on the number of harmful chemicals and 
contaminants that affect you every day. Here are some places to get the ball 
rolling.</p> 
<p><strong>Filter your water:</strong> You know how we feel about this one! I 
won&rsquo;t go into all the detail so well covered on the rest of our site, but 
suffice it to say that filtering both your drinking and bathing water can do 
wonders for your health and well-being (and peace of mind).</p> 
<p><strong>-</strong><strong>Did you know</strong> that in 2010, one of the 
top five recommendations of the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel for the 
prevention of environmentally caused cancer is to filter the water you drink? 
Every water source is different, even in taps from home to 
home.&nbsp;Variability is driven by local pollutants, water treatment 
techniques, the age and material composition of the pipes that deliver your 
water, and the faucet that you use. Even if you have the purest water being 
delivered to you by your municipal water source, your pipes may leach unwanted 
contaminants into the water in transport.&nbsp; Unfiltered tap water can 
contain harmful contaminants like chlorine, lead, pesticides, herbicides and 
cysts, and what&rsquo;s in your water varies by your geographic location and 
municipal water supply.</p> 
<p><strong>Audit your cupboard and fridge:</strong> That&rsquo;s right, I said 
<em>audit</em>. Maybe the looming advent of tax season has my brain going crazy 
with the term, but there are a few things you might want to take stock of.</p> 
<p><strong>-Sodium tri-poly-what?</strong> Anything containing an ingredient 
you cannot pronounce has got to go. I&rsquo;m not necessarily advocating a 
return to the hunter/gatherer diet regimen, but it&rsquo;s a safe bet that all 
those complex chemical formulas for extending the shelf life of food is not 
doing a heck of a lot of good for your body.</p> 
<p><strong>-Sell by 1997: Whoops!</strong> Check your sell-by dates and 
toss/recycle the stuff that has expired. If it&rsquo;s just a bit past the date 
and you feel comfortable eating it, that&rsquo;s all right: what I&rsquo;m 
going for here is to get rid of items that may have been named in an FDA recall 
sometime in the mid-90s.</p> 
<p><strong>-Green/Yellow/Red:</strong> Categorize your cabinet and fridge 
contents into Green, Yellow, and Red categories. Green being healthy: can eat 
whenever I want; Yellow being okay in moderation; Red being SPECIAL OCCASION 
ONLY. I&rsquo;m not a nutrition expert, but I strive for a mix of 50% Green 
category foods, 35% Yellow, and no more than 15% Red. (Hey, I never said I was 
perfect!)</p> 
<p><strong>Trash harsh chemical cleaning supplies:</strong> Some of the 
airborne toxins and residues of popular cleaning supplies can do more harm than 
good to you and your families. And my suggestion for an alternative is&hellip;
<strong>vinegar</strong>. That&rsquo;s right, plain and simple old white 
distilled vinegar, which is natural, non-toxic, and friendly to the Earth. 
It&rsquo;s mildly acidic, which allows it to clean effectively and help keep 
your family healthy and safe. Seewww.vinegartips.com for 1001 uses for our 
lovely (inexpensive) friend.</p> 
<p><strong>Check your clothing:</strong> The word for health these days is 
organic, and when it comes to clothing, the story is no different.</p> 
<p>-<strong>Holy cotton!</strong> There&rsquo;s new and trending research out 
there that states that the pesticides used to grow that cotton that makes it 
into our clothing can be deadly. The manufacturing processes add in more 
chemicals and toxins, and some dyes and ink are also highly toxic.</p> 
<p><strong>-Detergent degenerates:</strong> And check what you wash your 
clothes in, too! Those fragrant and ultra-whitening detergents can exacerbate 
skin conditions like eczema and wreak havoc on people who suffer from 
allergies, which says nothing about the possible toxins seeping in through your 
pores. I know some of those organic and non-toxic detergents don&rsquo;t have 
the same &ldquo;get it whiter and brighter&rdquo; promises that the Big Brands 
do, but I think I could buy a new blouse a little more often or be more careful 
if it meant remaining healthy for a few more years.</p>

<h3>  Shower Filters Enhance Natural Beauty and Health </h3> 
<p>Friday, December 10th, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Carbon Filter,faucet water filters,
Methods of Filtration,Shower Filters</p> 
<p>So you took the step of purchasing a drinking water filter in your house? 
Congratulations! You should take time to&nbsp;relish the relief you feel at 
providing healthy and safe drinking water for your family. I don&rsquo;t know 
about you, but before I installed a drinking water filter, I always felt a kind 
of sour internal feeling that maybe drinking the tap water wasn&rsquo;t really 
in my best interest, my heart plagued by guilt and doubt. But no more!</p> 
<p><strong>Bath &amp; Shower Demons</strong><br>
 Now let&rsquo;s turn our 
attention to another source of nasty business in the house: the shower and bath 
water. If you have noticed that your hair and skin seem to be dry and that your 
baths or showers irritate your skin, that is likely the result of shower water 
contamination: chlorine, lead, VOCs, SOCs, chloramine, and other harmful 
vapors. The potential damage that shower water contamination could be causing 
goes much further than just irritated skin or dry hair. When you take a shower, 
your skin &ldquo;drinks&rdquo; water that it comes in contact with. In fact, 
during an average shower, your skin absorbs as much water as you would drink 
during an average meal. If that water is not filtered, the good work you did to 
protect your family from bad water in the kitchen may be undermined in the 
bathrooms. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of the effects related to showering and 
bathing in chlorine-laden, unfiltered water:</p> 
<p>&bull; Contaminants absorbed more easily through skin and inhalation</p> 
<p>&bull; Mild or inflamed eczema and other skin disorders</p> 
<p>&bull; Inflamed asthma</p> 
<p>&bull; Dry, brittle hair</p> 
<p>&bull; Excessively dry and sensitive skin</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Eye irritation</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Respiratory irritation</p> 
<p><strong>The Upshot&hellip;</strong><br>
 The great news is that by taking 
the step to filter your bathing water, you can enjoy a good number of health 
and beauty benefits. It&rsquo;s amazing how much changing just that one little 
thing can do:</p> 
<p>&bull; Healthier skin</p> 
<p>&bull; Softer, more manageable hair</p> 
<p>&bull; Healthy steam</p> 
<p>&bull; Less respiratory inflammation</p> 
<p>&bull; Improvement in existing skin conditions</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Just Don&rsquo;t Inhale!</strong><br>
 Do you love taking long, 
steamy hot showers as much as I do? Ever had the unpleasant feeling of a tight 
chest or feel the need to cough? That steam we dig so much is the vaporized 
water coming out of the shower faucet, which&mdash;when 
unfiltered&mdash;contains all that vicious chlorine. That vaporized water 
invades your lungs and pollutes your body with even more unhealthy toxins. As 
much as we may love the idea of a relaxing, hot and steamy shower, the idea of 
standing in a small room with toxic steam makes the idea somewhat, shall we 
say, less appealing.</p> 
<p><strong>Shopping for a Shower Filter</strong><br>
 For the best and most 
effective results, you should look for a filter that employs carbon, which 
filters out synthetic chemicals, THMs and VOCs. Also look for a filter to have 
a KDF stage of filtration, to reduce the amount of chlorine and balance the 
water&rsquo;s Ph (for that healthy glow).</p>

<h3>  5 Ways to Determine if You Need to Worry about Tap Water Contamination 
</h3> 
<p>Friday, December 3rd, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Carbon Filter,Contaminants in Drinking 
Water,Environment,faucet water filters,Methods of Filtration,Shower Filters</p> 
<p>You may have heard the reports of the 60,000 chemicals from our industries 
that sometimes make their way into our drinking water supplies; the press keeps 
us abreast on what contaminants affect your water. You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard 
all the dramatic warnings concerning the dangers of heavy metals, chlorine, 
bacteria, viruses, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, cow pee and fairy 
dust. Depending on the amount of unfiltered tap water you consume and the 
specific contaminants, you and your family&rsquo;s health may be at risk.</p> 
<p><strong>Contaminants everywhere<br>
</strong>The Gulf Oil Spill. Lead and 
giardiasis in city water. Water boiling warnings. You&rsquo;ve seen this stuff 
all over the news, especially when the media run stories on local water 
supplies showing that this or that contaminant has been found. In these 
circumstances, your concern is probably justified. You may begin to worry, 
sniff the water that comes out of your taps, run water for 30 seconds before 
using it to cook or drink, or even make plans to buy bottled water or a water 
filter. Get the facts before you act. Consider the following:</p> 
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact your municipal water supplier.</strong>
 You have the right to review their annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) for 
ongoing water quality issues. If there is a widespread, short-term problem, 
your municipal water supplier will have some sort of statement prepared, and 
will likely have it posted on their website along with instructions on what to 
do.</p> 
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact local news and media outlets. </strong>
If there&rsquo;s a problem, they will more than likely know what&rsquo;s going 
on. And if you are the first to bring it to their attention, they will probably 
investigate it!</p> 
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact local hospitals or a trusted doctor.
</strong> If there&rsquo;s been a spike in recent cases of water-borne 
illnesses or sickness related to contamination, they will know about it and be 
able to tell you what the danger is to you and your family, what symptoms to 
look out for and how to avoid it.</p> 
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the EPA&rsquo;s website</strong> for 
information on contaminants that are prevalent in your area. This can be a good 
guide, but is rarely specific enough to really tell you enough information on 
your home or neighborhood. (Or try the Water Quality Association&rsquo;s
Interactive Problem Solver.)</p> 
<p><strong>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have your water tested</strong>. This is only 
applicable if the problem persists and the local water treatment supplier is 
unable to correct the levels of contamination. Find out what, exactly, the 
problem is so you can take steps to correct the problem yourself.</p> 
<p>Now, what to do if there is a problem? And worse yet, what if the problem 
is persistent? You can go the bottled water route, but that leaves you 
vulnerable while bathing. I&rsquo;d go with a water filter, for both drinking 
and bathing water, with a carbon filter that is certified by one of the two 
main independent certification organizations: Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or 
National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Also, check out this guide forhow to 
choose a water filter.</p> 
<p><strong>Treat the problem, not the symptoms<br>
</strong>We all have to 
work together to keep the federal, state, and local government accountable for 
how they treat the nation&rsquo;s water supply. This is not an issue that 
lobbyists should be deciding, but sadly it does come to that from time to time. 
Make your voice and your opinions known. Write your regional and state 
representatives, let them know you feel water contamination needs more 
attention, help set the agenda and get out there and vote on Election Day.</p> 
<p>Tap water contamination isn&rsquo;t a hoax, and it&rsquo;s no laughing 
matter. There really are contaminants in your drinking water. Small amounts of 
those pollutants aren&rsquo;t usually harmful, but exposure to large portions 
of impurities affects your health.</p>

quality and the issues that surround it.</p>

<h3>  Aren&rsquo;t All Water Purifiers Pretty Much the Same? </h3> 
<p>Monday, November 8th, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Carbon Filter,faucet water filters,
Methods of Filtration,Shower Filters</p> 
<p>If you are under the assumption that all water purifiers are the same, 
further research is in order.Water purifiers made by Aquasana have been shown 
to be superior and that means that they deliver quality drinking water. You 
need to understand that different products manufactured out there in the world 
of water filters are not all the same.</p> 
<p>There is also plenty of variety when it comes to what types of contaminants 
different water filtering systems are able to remove from the water. Therefore, 
you need to make sure the one that you get is designed for the types of 
contaminants found in your drinking water supply. To find out, get a water 
report that details what has been identified in your drinking water. The EPA 
requires that this information is kept up to date and accessible.</p> 
<p><strong>Aquasana Water Purifiers &ndash; You Can Tell the Difference
</strong></p> 
<p>Water purifiers from Aquasana offer you a system that is very simple to 
use. This is a great method of removing the various impurities from your 
drinking water orthe water that you bathe in. You certainly don&rsquo;t want to 
drink or have heavy metals or other forms of contamination get into your pores 
when you shower.</p> 
<p>As you take your time to explore your own water filtering needs, you will 
be less intimidated when the time comes to shop for one of them and you will 
have become an educated consumer. Water purifiers from Aquasana are easier than 
you think to purchase and begin using. This is a cost-effective method that 
ensures you can have an unlimited supply of healthy water all of the time.</p> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to continue allowing your family to take in harmful 
forms of contamination. Even if the levels are below what the EPA guidelines 
are, there are many studies out there that link serious health problems, 
including cancer, to drinking water. The risk is much too high to feel safe 
about drinking plain tap water.</p> 
<p>The cost of bottled water continues to increase all the time. It also gives 
a false sense of safety that you are drinking pure water. Bottled water has 
contaminants in it, just like tap water. The plastic bottles that the product 
is sold in cause environmental problems, too, so you need to find a better 
solution than buying bottled water.</p> 
<p>Water purifiers from Aquasana can be found online if you aren&rsquo;t able 
to buy them locally. They have terrific reviews and that is certainly 
encouraging. Now is the time to take action and to get quality drinking water 
in your home. That is going to bring peace of mind to your home. Plus, it will 
save you lots of money over bottled water.</p> 
<p>There are many types of water purifiers from Aquasana that allow you to get 
great drinking water and to filter the water for your shower, and they even 
have water bottles that you can refill for when you are away from home. They 
are a company dedicated to making sure you have great water in spite of what is 
found in your environment.</p>

<h3>  Using Whole House Water Filter Reviews to Help You Pick the Best One 
</h3> 
<p>Friday, October 8th, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters,Methods of Filtration</p> 
<p>Each household has a different water filter need. The condition of tap 
water is different in every community. Contaminants in different neighborhoods 
and industrial areas differ in severity as well. Because of this, each home 
must be aware of the state of their tap water and the type of home water filter 
they need.</p> 
<p>Once you know the kind of water filter you need, it is important to convey 
this to your water filter professional. A good water filter system company like 
Aquasana can then help you find the right kind of water filter unit based on 
the condition of your tap water and your budget.</p> 
<p>It is true that water filter professionals can be very helpful in your 
quest for reliable and healthy drinking water. It is also important for each 
home water filter buyer to read and understand consumer product reviews of the 
water filter unit they choose to buy.</p> 
<p>There are some things other customers can tell you that professionals and 
sales representatives might fail to point out. That is the kind of 
&ldquo;insider information&rdquo; that you can get from water filter reviews. 
Here are some things to keep in mind when reading a home water filter review:
<br> <em><br>
 The Taste of Filtered Water</em></p> 
<p>Water coming from different water filters will have different tastes. No 
one is better equipped to tell you about the distinct taste of the water coming 
from the water filter brand you choose than the people who have used it. Users 
of that water filter can most accurately tell you how your water will taste 
like compared to that of other water filter brands.</p> 
<p><em>The Life of the Unit</em></p> 
<p>You do not want a water filter system that will wear out easily. By 
listening to the opinions of other users as expressed in water filter reviews, 
you can know how long a unit can be expected to last. This way, you can find 
out if the materials used in the unit are of good quality. The durability of a 
water filter system as reported in water filter reviews will also tell you a 
great deal about the quality of workmanship that went into the manufacturing of 
that water filter.<br>
<em><br>
 Repair Information</em></p> 
<p>You also do not want a water filter that will break down easily. Every 
filter unit will require you to change the filter cartridge regularly. Aside 
from that, you should not be bothered with frequent repairs. By reading home 
water filter system reviews, you can find out what brands require fewer repairs 
and what brands have fewer problems. You can also find out which ones are 
easier to use and how accessible repair parts are. This is very important 
information to note that you may not find any other way than by reading water 
filter reviews.</p> 
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p> 
<p>People tend to rely heavily on other consumer&rsquo;s recommendations for 
any major purchase. There is something about getting a recommendation from a 
customer that bought, used, and loved the product that builds your confidence 
in the purchase you are about to make. This just goes to show that the product 
satisfied their expectations, and it has a good chance of meeting your 
expectations, too. This same principle applies to reading and using the 
valuable insights that are only available from water system reviews.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for a trusted water filter unit, check out Aquasana 
water filters. Their filters have been trusted by homes across the country for 
many years. Home water filter reviews from satisfied Aquasana customers will 
reflect that Aquasana is one of the country&rsquo;s most trusted water filter 
brands.</p>

<h3>  What Are Drinking Water Filters and How Do You Use Them? </h3> 
<p>Saturday, August 7th, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Methods of Filtration</p> 
<p>Our water supply originates in the form of rain. It falls from the sky, 
becoming part of the earth in oceans, streams, and lakes, and is absorbed into 
land, settling in the water underground. Through this process it absorbs many 
minerals that are essential to human life. Unfortunately, it also absorbs many 
harmful contaminants. While some of the contaminants have natural sources, most 
are chemicals introduced into the water and air by humans. Some are introduced 
through the products we use, manufacturing, and farming. Most are put into the 
water through water treatment plants as a means to disinfect and clean the 
water. This makes truly natural water a rarity.</p> 
<p>Filtration systems are a way to get the water that enters our home as close 
to its safe and natural state as possible. The simplest and most effective way 
is the carbon water filter, according to HeartSpring.net. These carbon filters 
are made from coconut husks and absorb the contaminants from your drinking 
water as it passes through. They are easy to install and will filter out all 
the major contaminants that are still left in your drinking water after it is 
treated by your water treatment facility. These filters still allow the 
minerals that are essential to your health through, however.</p> 
<p>To use drinking water filters you simply install them on your water 
faucets, either on the countertop or below. The water from the faucet is first 
pulled through the filtration system and then back out of the spout. Aquasana 
manufacturers the best filtration systems on the market. Their systems not only 
use carbon filters but ion exchange, where lead is exchanged with potassium 
ions that enhance the pH of the water. They also use sub-micron filtration, 
which removes cysts from your water.</p>

<h3>  What is the Easiest Way to Install a Refrigerator Water Filter? </h3> 
<p>Friday, July 16th, 2010</p> 
<p>Categories: Aquasana Water Filters</p> 
<p>There is always a nice feeling of accomplishment that a homeowner can enjoy 
when you hook up your faucet water filter system to give you an endless supply 
of pure, clean, and good-tasting filtered water. Since tap water that goes 
through a quality water filtration system is even better water than what you 
can buy at the store, you may be able to pay for that water filter system 
pretty quickly by simply not having to buy bottled water any more.</p> 
<p>That joy and sense of accomplishment may be diminished when you step back 
and watch how your family gets cold water to drink on a regular basis. If they 
routinely draw their drinking water from the faucet that is in the door of the 
refrigerator, you may suddenly realize that your shiny new faucet water 
filtration system is not enough. You should also consider whether adding a 
refrigerator water filter is in order.</p> 
<p>That answer will probably be &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Even if your refrigerator 
doesn&rsquo;t dispense drinking water directly, everybody likes ice in their 
water, especially in the summertime. If the water that comes into the 
refrigerator through a separate line is not being filtered correctly, your 
efforts to assure healthy drinking water for your family might be coming undone 
when they put ice that is full of contaminants in their water.</p> 
<p>There are a couple pieces of good news, though, that make it easier to 
accept that you may have a job ahead of you in adding a refrigerator water 
filter as well as the one you put on the sink. First of all, if you spent the 
extra money on a whole house water filtration system, then you can rest easy. 
The water going to your refrigerator is already filtered before it comes into 
the house just like the water going to your sink, you showers, your dishwasher, 
and even your toilets.</p> 
<p>It is smart to perform this kind of cost analysis if you have not invested 
in any form of water filtration system yet. You will benefit by taking an hour 
and talking through your needs with a qualified water filter expert like the 
ones at Aquasana who can help you compare the benefits of each kind of filter 
compared to the costs. The outcome of that evaluation might surprise you.</p> 
<p>If you are thinking about listing the various water filtration systems you 
might need and a refrigerator water filter is on that list, it might be smart 
to think about a whole house water filter system instead. Many times the cost 
is about the same or less than putting individual water filters at each point 
of use.</p> 
<p>If putting in a separate refrigerator water filter system is the best way 
to go, it isn&rsquo;t a very complicated operation. In most cases, you can buy 
a very simple inline refrigerator water filter from a good water filter 
supplier like Aquasana. These efficient units are installed between the water 
line going to your refrigerator and the connection in the refrigerator cabinet 
where the water feeds into the unit.</p> 
<p>The steps are pretty basic. Simply pull out your refrigerator and locate 
the water line that feeds the water faucet and icemaker in your refrigerator. 
Usually it is integrated into the kitchen plumbing in some way. That line 
disconnects at a valve at the base of the refrigerator in most cases. Now take 
a moment and locate where the water can be turned off and where the 
refrigerator plugs in so you can disconnect the unit and cut off the flow of 
water while you install your refrigerator water filter unit.</p> 
<p>The refrigerator water filter will use the same standard connections that 
are already attached to the hose. Simply disconnect the water hose from the 
refrigerator and connect it to the &ldquo;water in&rdquo; side of the inline 
refrigerator water filter. The &ldquo;water out&rdquo; side will connect to a 
small connector hose that will then run to your refrigerator to connect to the 
unit where you unscrewed the hose a moment ago.</p> 
<p>Tighten all of the connections, turn the water back on, and plug the 
refrigerator back in. Just like that, you have put in your own refrigerator 
water filter. Now the only complicated thing is remembering to replace the 
filter part inside the refrigerator water filter unit about every six months. 
If you do that, you will start getting clean, healthy, and fresh water coming 
out of your refrigerator and in the ice you use that is just as delicious and 
healthy as the filtered water you get from your faucet water filter unit.</p>
