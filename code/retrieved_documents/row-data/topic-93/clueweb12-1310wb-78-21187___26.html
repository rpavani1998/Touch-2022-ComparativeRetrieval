<h4>Our take on the Sonos&reg; Play:3 (S3)</h4>  by Tara W. <br>
<br>

<h1>All the music you want &#151; anywhere in your home</h1> 
<p> Access PANDORA&reg; Internet radio, Rhapsody&reg;, Spotify, iHeartRadio, 
Last.fm, Napster&reg;, SiriusXM, and 100,000 free Internet radio stations 
&mdash; no matter where you are in your home. The compact Sonos Play:3 lets you 
enjoy music from the Internet as well as songs stored on your home computers 
&mdash; without filling your room with audio gear. It's perfect for small rooms 
and cozy corners, and setup is as easy as pushing a button.</p> 
<p> Watch our video review below. </p>  Please wait while loading video. 
<h1> Video Not Found</h1> 
<p> We are sorry, but the video is currently not available.</p> <br>
<br>

<h2>Expand to any (or every) room</h2> 
<p> Place Sonos players, like the Play:3 and the larger Play:5, in every room 
where you want to listen to music. The players connect to the Internet and 
communicate with each other using Sonos' proprietary wireless network. If you 
have your router in a room where you won't have a Sonos player, use aBridge to 
connect to your network.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>You probably already own a Sonos controller</h2> 
<p> You can use an iPhone&reg;, iPod touch&reg;, iPad&reg;, or Android&trade; 
phone to control any and all Sonos players. A free download turns your 
smartphone and tablet into a full-fledged Sonos controller. Easily navigate and 
search through playlists and tracks stored on your computer, or select an 
Internet radio station. Create customized playlists on the fly for individual 
rooms or for playback over your entire Sonos system. You can also mute or 
adjust the volume of each of your players.</p> 
<h2> Rhapsody&reg;, PANDORA&reg;, SIRIUS, and more at your fingertips</h2> 
<p> The Sonos system works seamlessly with a host of Internet-based digital 
music services, including Rhapsody, PANDORA, last.fm&#153;, Napster&reg;, and 
SIRIUS Internet Radio. Rhapsody offers instant access to millions of songs and 
ad-free radio stations. SIRIUS Internet Radio gives you access to over 80 
channels of programming. Every Sonos system includes free 30-day trials of 
these two services, so you can start listening the moment you take it out of 
the box. PANDORA and last.fm create customized Internet radio streams just for 
you &#151; all you have to do is enter the name of your favorite song or 
artist. And because Sonos connects directly to the Internet for all of these 
music services, you don't even have to turn on your PC.</p> 
<h2>MOG &mdash; millions of songs, available instantly</h2> 
<p> MOG is an up-and-coming online music service with one of the largest and 
best-sounding streaming catalogs in the industry. It's the only service to 
offer all of its music in the 320 kbps MP3 format &mdash; that higher bit rate 
translates to better sound. In fact, we use it frequently in the Crutchfield 
Labs to test high-end audio gear. MOG's &quot;Primo&quot; service ($9.99/month) 
gives you unlimited, ad-free access to their extensive music library on a wide 
range of devices including Sonos&reg; network music players, Samsung TVs, your 
computer, iPad&reg;, iPhone&reg;, and Android&#153; devices.</p> 
<h2>Expand your Sonos system</h2> 
<p> You can have up to 32 ZonePlayers in your Sonos system, and each one can 
play an independent selection of individual tracks or playlists. Listen to jazz 
in the den while your spouse plays rock music in the kitchen, or pump a single 
playlist of songs throughout the entire house during a party.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Sonos Play:3 is a wireless HiFi speaker 
system that lets you stream your entire music library, music services, and 
Internet radio stations from your wireless home network.&nbsp; The Sonos Play:3 
lets you use your iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, or any Sonos Controller (616CR200, 
sold separately) to control your music. The Play:3 creates room-filling, 
high-performance sound using an integrated three-way speaker system driven by 
three built-in digital amplifiers. In a multi-room sound system, the first 
Play:3 is connected to your home network via Ethernet or using the SONOS Bridge 
(616BR100, sold separately), and each subsequent Play:3 can be wired or 
completely wireless.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get started, you must wire either one Sonos 
Play:3 or Sonos Bridge (sold separately) to your home network using a standard 
Ethernet cable (included). The Sonos Play:3 works seamlessly with the complete 
range of Sonos products.</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Wireless Technology</h2> 
<p><strong>SonosNet 2.0 Wireless Mesh Network: </strong>The Sonos Play:3 
brings great sounding music wirelessly to any room in your house, without a big 
wiring project. SonosNet 2.0, a proprietary wireless mesh network technology, 
provides superior wireless range for whole-house coverage, ensures synchronous 
music playback, and avoids sources of wireless interference. The transmitting 
range of the Play:3's built-in wireless system is approximately 100 feet, 
depending upon your home's layout.</p> 
<p><strong>Simple Wireless Setup: </strong>No technical or wireless expertise 
is required to install the Sonos Play:3. Simply, place a Play:3 in any room 
where you want music, plug it in and enjoy. To get started, you must wire one 
PLAY:3 or a Sonos Bridge (616BR100, sold separately) to your router to access 
your home's network; via standard Ethernet cable (included). Then the Sonos 
System Setup software provides simple on-screen prompts on any Sonos 
controller, computer, iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, or Android. With the touch of a 
few buttons, you'll be playing music all over the house in minutes.</p> 
<p><strong>Multi-Zone Compatibility:</strong> You can place a Play:3 in each 
zone where you want to listen to music. The Sonos Digital Music System can 
accept up to 32 players. With multiple zones, you can play the same song in 
different rooms, or different songs in different rooms.</p> 
<p><strong>2-Way Ethernet Port: </strong>When wirelessly connected to a Sonos 
Bridge or another Sonos component, you can use the Ethernet port on the back of 
the Play:3 to bring standard Internet connectivity to your Satellite/Cable 
set-top box, DVR, PC, game console, or network hard drive.</p> 
<h2>Audio Section</h2> 
<p><strong>3 Driver/3 Amp Speaker System: </strong>The Sonos Play:3 uses three 
state-of the-art digital amplifiers individually coupled with three speakers to 
deliver great sound to any room. The wireless music system provides pure, clean 
sound that is perfect for bringing room filling music to a kitchen, bedroom, 
office, or just about any room in your home. A bass radiator produces powerful 
low notes while, two mid-range drivers and one tweeter fills out the sound.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Class-D Amp:</strong> The Play:3 employs state of the art, great 
sounding amplifiers that are lightweight, powerful, and very energy efficient 
in standby and use.</li> 
<li><strong>Tweeter:</strong> One tweeter creates a crisp and accurate high 
frequency response.</li> 
<li><strong>2 Midranges:</strong> Two dedicated mid-range drivers ensure the 
faithful reproduction of midrange frequencies crucial for accurate playback of 
vocals and instruments.</li> 
<li><strong>Bass Radiator:</strong> A bass radiator is tuned to use the 
energized air volume inside of Play:3 to provide deep, clean and surprisingly 
powerful bass from such a small package</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>DSP Circuitry:</strong> From the recording studio to your home, the 
music is reproduced as the artist intended. All filter settings, active 
equalization, and time-alignment are done in the digital domain through 
state-of-the-art DSP circuitry so there's absolutely no loss of audio quality 
or energy.</p> 
<p><strong>Tone Controls:</strong> Optimize sound performance using 
zone-specific bass, treble, balance, and loudness controls. Adjust volume by 
individual zone or by groups of zones.</p> 
<p><strong>Stereo Pairing:</strong> The Stereo Pair setting allows you to 
group two Play:3s in the same room to create a wider stereo experience. In this 
configuration, one unit serves as the left channel and the other serves as the 
right channel.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When creating a stereo pair, it is best to place the 
two Sonos components 8' to 10' away from each other, angled inward to form a 
triangle with your favorite listening position.</p> </blockquote> 
<h2>Music Streaming</h2> 
<p><strong>Music Streaming:</strong> The Sonos Play:3 lets you play your 
entire music library, listen to your online music services, and get thousands 
of free radio stations worldwide.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Internet Radio (100,000 free stations included): </strong>Tune in 
to 100,000 Internet radio stations, shows &amp; podcasts; free of charge and 
pre-loaded on the Sonos Play:3. You can browse endlessly or type in the call 
letters or name of your favorite station or host and hit Search. Tune in to 
live radio shows on everything from politics to sports to entertainment, catch 
up on what you missed with podcasts featuring the best of previous shows, or

it where you live and it will give you all the local radio stations streaming 
on the Internet. You can even add to it to Favorites so it's easy to find the 
next time. The unit supports MP3 and WMA Internet streaming.</p> 
<p><strong>Online Music Services:</strong> A music service is an online music 
store or online service that sells audio on a per song, per audiobook, or 
subscription basis. Sonos works seamlessly with Anubis.fm, AUPEO!, Deezer, 
iheartradio, iTunes, Last.fm, MOG, Napster, Pandora, Rdio, Rhapsody, SiriusXM,

<p><strong>Music Libraries: </strong>The Sonos Play:3 wireless music system 
can play music from any computer or network-attached storage (NAS) device on 
your home network where you have shared music folders. The Sonos Play:3 can 
play music stored on up to 16 PCs, Macs or NAS (Network Attached Storage) 
devices on your home network, supporting the most popular audio formats. The 
Sonos Play:3 indexes your music folders so you can view your music collection 
by categories (such as artists, albums, composers, genres, or tracks). The 
Sonos Play:3 supports the following audio file formats - MP3 (compressed), WMA 
(compressed), AAC (MPEG4), iTunes, Ogg Vorbis, Audible (format 4), Apple 
Lossless, Flac (lossless), WAV (uncompressed), and AIFF (uncompressed).</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Previously purchased Apple &quot;Fairplay&quot; 
DRM-protected songs may need to be upgraded. WMA Lossless format not currently 
supported.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Optional iPod Dock:</strong> Dock, charge and wirelessly play the 
music from an iPod or iPhone with the Sonos DOCK (616WD100, sold separately). 
The Sonos Wireless Dock 100 lets you play music from select iPods or iPhones on 
a Sonos Wireless Multi-Room Music System throughout your home. You can 
wirelessly play all the music that's stored or playing (including many music 
apps) on your iPod or iPhone in all the rooms of&nbsp; your home or office 
where you have Sonos.</p> 
<h2>Controllers</h2> 
<p><strong>System Control: </strong>The Sonos Zone Play:3 provides control of 
your music using a Sonos Controller (sold separately), iPod touch, iPhone, 
iPad, Android Smartphone, or desktop controller software.</p> 
<p><strong>Sonos Controller:</strong> The Sonos Zone Controller (616CR200, 
sold separately) works exclusively with the Sonos Digital Music Wireless 
Systems, and allow you to control and view all of your music and all of your 
zones wirelessly from the palm of your hand. You can even view Album Art. The 
controller communicates with the nearest Sonos Player through Sonosnet, a 
secure, peer-to-peer wireless mesh network, allowing you to extend the range of 
the controller to any room in your house, even outside. Because it communicates 
with the nearest Sonos Player, rather than through one distant control point, 
the system avoids sources of wireless interference. The range of the Sonosnet 
is 50 to 100 feet, a range similar to that of an 802.11g wireless access point.
</p> 
<p><strong>Controller Apps: </strong>The Sonos Play:3 can be controlled from 
your iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone. Free Sonos Controller 
apps for Android, iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad let you control your zone 
players, music on the Internet and your computer right from the palm of your 
hand. You are able to search for songs and stations, choose the music, and 
control the volume. You can also view song and artist information, as well as 
Album Art. You can even get a text or a call on your iPhone or Android 
smartphone and the music will keep playing.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Download the apps for free on the iTunes App Store 
or Android Market. Your iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad must have iOS 3.0 or later 
installed. Your smartphone must have Android 2.1 or up installed.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><strong>Top-Panel Controls:</strong> The Play:3 Provides quick access to 
volume and mute controls when you don't have a remote controller in hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Desktop Controller Software: </strong>The supplied setup disc 
contains the software for the Desktop Controller, which allows you to control 
the Sonos Digital Music System from your home computer. It includes easy-to-use 
wizards for setup and music sharing so the music folders on your hard drive can 
be shared across all your Sonos players. You can also add Internet Radio 
stations and set preferences for online updates. Once the system is set up, all 
you need to do is choose your music, choose your zone, and press Play. The 
Desktop Controller is compatible with Windows XP and higher, as well as 
Macintosh OS X (10.4 and higher) operating systems.</p> 
<h2>Mounting Options</h2> 
<p><strong>Versatile Placement: </strong>You can place the Sonos Play:3 
wherever you find the sound most enjoyable. Its compact size makes it easy to 
place the Play:3 on your desk, the kitchen counter, on your nightstand, or 
carry it out to the patio with you.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Sonos Play:3 is not water-resistant; do not 
leave it outside during a rain storm or position it near water. Care should be 
taken if placing the Sonos Play:3 close to an older CRT television. If you 
notice any discoloration or distortion of your picture quality, simply move the 
Play:3 further from the television.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Horizontal/Vertical Mounting:</strong> Position the Play:3 in a 
horizontal or vertical orientation to make a perfect fit into tight spots 
around you home like on bookshelves, nightstands, corners, or just about 
anywhere else. The EQ automatically adjusts so the sound you hear is always 
great, not matter what orientation you use.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For optimum performance, maintaining more than 
1&quot; clearance around the back of the unit is recommended.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>Rubber Feet:</strong> Integrated rubber feet protect your furniture 
and keep the Play:3 secure.</p> 
<p><strong>Wall-Mount (optional): </strong>The Sonos Play:3 has a 1/4&quot;-20 
integrated, threaded mounting hole. If desired, you can easily wall mount the 
Play:3 using a suitable mounting bracket (sold separately). Simply choose a 
location that's close to an electrical outlet, taking care to avoid heat, 
steam, dripping water or hidden wiring, and follow the instructions included 
with your wall mount kit.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure the wall mount bracket you purchase will 
support at least 10 lbs.</p> </blockquote> 
<h2>Network Requirements</h2> 
<p><strong>Hardware: </strong>In order to play the digital music files stored 
on your computer throughout the Sonos Digital Music System, you must meet the 
following hardware requirements:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Ethernet:</strong> You must have an Ethernet network interface 
connection in your computer. If you do not have one, you will need to buy and 
install a Network Interface Card (NIC) before setting up your system.</li> 
<li><strong>Modem:</strong> It is highly recommended that you have a DSL/cable 
modem, or LAN-based high-speed Internet connection. It is not designed for a 
dial-up system.</li> 
<li><strong>Router:</strong> If you have a cable or DSL modem connected 
directly to your computer, you should have a router connected between your 
modem and your computer to maintain your computer's security. If you don't have 
a router, you will need to buy and install one before setting up your system.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong> In addition to the above-described 
hardware, your computer must have the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Compatible Operating Systems: </strong>Windows XP (SP2) and 
higher, Macintosh OS X (10.4 and higher)</li> 
<li><strong>CPU: </strong>500 MHz processor or better </li> 
<li><strong>RAM: </strong>128MB RAM minimum/256MB RAM recommended </li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Automatic Software Updates:</strong> Once the Sonos Play:3 system 
has been registered, Sonos will automatically notify you when software updates 
are available. Simply press one button and your system updates itself.</p>

 &nbsp;  Great unit. Was up and running in a matter of 
minutes. The sound is good for such a small device and it is versatile enough 
to use anywhere in the house. I plan on adding at least two more units. Pros: 
<br> Ease of use. Sound quality. <br>
Cons: <br>
If you don't have a controller 
(iphone etc) the Sonos controller makes the price prohibitive. <br>

<strong>Crutchfield 
Customer Review</strong> 
<p> The reviewer purchased this item from us, verified by the email address on 
the order.</p> <br>
 &nbsp;  This was my first introduction to the Sonos 
system, and I must say that I am a big fan. The convenience and variety of 
music available, especially when paired with a Spotify membership, is simply 
amazing.<br>
<br>
Setup was easy -- less than 5 minutes from opening the box to 
listening to my MP3 collection and iheartradio.<br>
<br>
The sound from the 
Sonos Play:3 is good. I am using it in my kitchen, and it provides plenty of 
sound and plenty of bass for my needs in the kitchen. It also sounds good in my 
larger family room, as long as you intend for it to be ambient music at a 
moderate volume.<br>
<br>
I rated it a &quot;4&quot; because I think it really 
needs an &quot;audio in&quot; port like the Play:5. Other than this omission, I 
think it is a wonderful product. <br>

 &nbsp;  We love this. It is so easy to use; seriously it's 
great. We live in an old house, and it's hard to put speakers where you want 
with these crazy plaster walls - but Sonos makes it easy, and the sound on the 
3 speaker is plenty big for us. Love the iPhone app. Pros: <br>
nice sound, 
easy to move, easy to set up, easy to use, iPhone app <br>
Cons: <br>
wish it 
was a little easier to play podcasts from my itunes <br>

<strong>Crutchfield 
Customer Review</strong> 
<p> The reviewer purchased this item from us, verified by the email address on 
the order.</p> <br>
 &nbsp;  I love this little player--its good qualities far 
outweigh its cons. However, consider well what you want to use it for before 
you purchase (Sonos and Crutchfield customer service are both excellent). The 
volume and sound quality are good enough to enjoy the full range of sound when 
playing music and to surmount the noise of housework, paper shuffling, etc. 
Setup was easy (but be sure you insert the sonos end of the A/C fully--until 
the &quot;shoulder&quot; of the cord is flush or below the casing or you will 
have intermittent function!). Network range is not quite as good as with my 
computers but still excellent. Pros: <br>
Great sound, portable. Great for 
radio (especially those of us who have no reception over the air). Easily 
synced to most iTunes content. Easy setup. <br>
Cons: <br>
Biggest cons: 
Terribly expensive controller if you don't have smart phone, etc.; no input 
port. Other: no easy way to stream podcasts, etc., directly from browser or 
browser download, no way I've found to stream content stored on iPhone, etc., 
to Play3 without a networked, awake computer (If I've missed something here, 
I'd love some advice). Audiobooks must 1st be imported into iTunes (9.0.2, Mac 
OS Tiger 10.4.11)--syncing &amp; playback of this content via Sonos app is not 
intuitive. <br>

Customer Review</strong> 
<p> The reviewer purchased this item from us, verified by the email address on

 &nbsp;  I have been shopping around for quite a while. I 
bought a foreclosed home in which they took all components of a wired multi 
room system including the speakers. I found this system and it gives you such a 
wide range of options and flexibility for listening. I have this speaker in my 
kitchen, a bridge, a zone player attached to my home theater and putting the 
larger speakers elsewhere. This small one sits on my kitchen counter and I have 
the zone player hooked into the TV so I can hear my TV from my kitchen without 
blasting the folks in the family room. Love the system, so easy to set up! 
(also, cheaper than a hard wired multi room system which gives you less options)
Pros: <br>
Easy to set up. Great flexibilty, great apps for ipods/iphones. <br>

Cons: <br>
Wish it was cheaper but its still less expensive than a home wired 
system. <br>

<h3> Added Sonos:3. Going for :5</h3> Written By Kayakor, Downingtown, PA on

 Crutchfield Customer Review (What's this?) <br>

<strong>Crutchfield Customer Review</strong> 
<p> The reviewer purchased this item from us, verified by the email address on 
the order.</p> <br>
 &nbsp;  First I connected the Sonos Connect to my Bose 
bookshelf speakers in my library/office. I love it. Even better, my wife (who 
avoids technology)loves it. She would rather play that then our $2000 surround 
sound system in the Family Room. When her birthday came she half heartedly 
suggested a Sonos:5 for the deck. With some trepidation I bought the Sonos:3 
for the kitchen (there is no space in the kitchen for the :5. I was pleasantly 
surprised. She loves it and plays them both all the time.<br>
<br>
Wish there 
were a Sonos that could replace that boat anchor of a surround sound system. I 
can buy the Sonos:Connect. But I would still have to fiddle with the Surround 
Sound System manually.<br>
<br>
I put a 2 terabyte networked hard drive on the 
network and loaded every CD I ever bought and more on it. Now we are buying and 
storing our online purchases there. Now I am listening to CDs I never would 
have pulled out. I listen to my favorite radio stations. I have NEW favorite 
radio stations I never new existed. I listen to Pandora. I control it all from 
every network connected device.<br>
<br>
Still would like a :5 for the deck 
this summer. Pros: <br>
Sounds great. Loads of features. Easy to use from 
Computer, iPad and Droid. Sounds great. Fun. Easy set-up. Compact and 
unobtrusive. <br>
Cons: <br>
I turn the volume UP from my Droid... she turns it 
down from her I pad... UP, down, UP, down. Needs a 'lock out the wife button'. 
Sound from the :3 is weak compared to the :Connect. Expensive. <br>
