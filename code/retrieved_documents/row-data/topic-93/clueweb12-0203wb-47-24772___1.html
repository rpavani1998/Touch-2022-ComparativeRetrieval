<h2>Collect Rain Water For Your Plants!</h2> 
<p> by Scott Lilly <br>
(Delaware, OH, USA) </p> 
<p> For the past two years, I have been collecting rain water to water my 
garden plants with instead of using city what from the garden hose. Not only is 
it more pleasant to smell when using and helps your budget because its free, 
the plants LOVE it.<br>
<br>
Rain water is not full of all the chemicals found 
in city water and its full of nutrients absorbed during the evaporation process 
that leads to rain. Its a win win!</p>

<strong>Great idea but...</strong> <br>

 The first time I saw someone do this was on Living 
with Ed. It's a great way to conserve but it doesn't seem very practical. <br>

<strong>Great 
idea, but</strong> <br>
<strong>by: Anonymous</strong><br>

 This is truly 
a great idea. Not only is the water free, but it is also free of the chemicals 
that are found in tap water, as mentioned in the tip. One slight disagreement, 
though, is that the rainwater will not be full of nutrients as stated in the 
tip. Just as the evaporation process will leave behind bad chemicals that may 
be in the water, it will also leave behind nutrients (good chemicals) that are 
in the water. <br>

 I am 
just curious if you use a cistern to collect the water, or if you use your 
gutters. Freat idea though. <br>

<strong>Try fish tank water, too</strong> <br>
<strong>by:

<br>
 I collect rain water also and my plants are doing 
great. I also use the water that I replace from my fish tanks instead of 
throwing it out. I had read somewhere...can't remember where, sorry!...that 
there was a ton of nutrients in that water as well. Plus, I don't feel like I'm 
wasting all that water, when I clean the tanks. <br>

 I am very interested in doing this to conserve 
water and same money at the same time. We have new bushes and flowers to water 
daily and this would be very helpful and convenient! <br>

<strong>Saves money too</strong> <br>

 We just started doing this a month 
ago. We get free 55 gallon plastic drums where I work. We place them under rain 
gutters and haven't had to run our pump and well yet to get water for the yard 
and garden. <br>

<strong>Rain Water + Fertilizer</strong> <br>
<strong>by: James Chillinger

<br>
 In addition to collecting rain water I also add in a 
fertilizer stick and the combination seems to be amazing for my house plants.

<strong>I 
love it!</strong> <br>
<strong>by: Melanie</strong><br>

 Wow! What a great 
tip! I never would have thought to collect rain water to water my plants, but 
it makes perfect sense! Plus, it's all-natural and I love that. I love using 
stuff from nature in gardening, and what's more natural than the water that 
falls from the sky?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the tip! <br>
