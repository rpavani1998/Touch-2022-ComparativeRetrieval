<h1>How to make the best use of water for your plants</h1> 
<p>with Troy Scott Smith</p> ( see Troy's Profile ) <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Gardens have a complex relationship with the <br>
wider environment 
and man gardeners are highly conscious of this dependence.<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The most valuable natural resource in a garden is water. It is a 
limited commodity and one that may become scarce in dry weather, so it is vital 
to understand the needs of plants and take steps to reduce water loss from them 
and from the soil.<br>
<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Water storage</h2> 
<p>For domestic gardens, water butts are the most practical answer in either 
moulded plastic, resin, traditional wood or smart new galvanised metal 
versions. They range in size from a compact 40 litres (10 gallons) to a 
substantial 450 litres (120 gallons).</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h3><em>TIP When water may be sitting in butts for some time, create shade 
around the butt (with planting or by using an awning). Also stir up the water 
periodically to ensure oxygen is present.</em></h3></li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Leaky hose <em>v.</em> sprinklers</h2> 
<p>In a large garden, a travelling sprinkler system is a good idea. This is 
like a pushchair, with two wheels at the rear and a smaller one at the front. 
It winds the sprinkler to the end of an extended cable, watering as it goes. It 
automatically shuts off at the end of its run. get advice from a specialist 
company which can guide you through the many choices<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>TIP When deciding which type of irrigation system is right for 
you, bear in mind that sprinklers can lose up to 80% of the water to the 
atmosphere or by evaporation on the ground before getting to the plants. 
However, they may be the best option where constant cultivation would make 
using leaky hoses difficult.</strong> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Adapting to climate change</h2> 
<p>Understanding plants' natural environments allows the gardener to provide 
the conditions in which the plants will give their best. For those parts of 
Britain that can suffer from low rainfall and hot summers, strong, drying winds
</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<p>can cause plants to transpire (lose water through their leaves). All of 
this means that careful selection of plants is crucial to their success.<br>

</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>TIP In California, the south west Cape District of South Africa, 
Chile, south and western Australia and the Mediterranean, most of the year's 
rain falls during the cooler months, and summers are dry. Many plants, native 
to these areas, can survive on very little moisture and most will grow well in 
dry areas with hot summers.</strong> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Getting the soil right</h2> 
<p>Essential to any new planting is proper soil preparation. With heavy clay 
this can mean incorporating grit to open the soil, and organic matter to enrich 
it. This kind of preparation enables the soil to hold on to water without 
becoming waterlogged, thus allowing rapid establishment of plants. If you are 
on light or sandy soil, organic matter added in acts in the same way, helping 
water retention.</p> 
<h2>How much to water</h2>Established plants need approximately 2.5cm of water 
every 10 days in dry spells. To check the application rates, use rain gauges 
positioned nearby when watering. Try to water plants either late or early in 
the day when the moisture will be retained for longer in the soil
<ul> 
<li><strong>TIP Create a &lsquo;reservoir' or depression in the ground around 
the plant, to prevent the water from running away. It is better to give plants 
a good soaking than to water little and often.</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is no good just making the soil damp - it has to be thoroughly wetted 
for the water to travel down to the roots - the root zone or top 60cm of soil 
has to be wetted. As a guide, 24 litres per sqm every 7-10 days will be 
sufficient to maintain plant growth.</p> 
<p>Coarse sand might hold 5cm of rainfall in the top 60cm of soil, while a 
clay soil might hold 10.5cm of rain. Just remember to garden with nature and 
not against it.</p> 
<h2>Choosing the right plants</h2> 
<p> Plants that grow in Mediterranean areas have developed distinctive types 
of foliage and storage systems, to minimise water loss or store water in 
periods of drought.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Hairy leaves (such as those on verbascums and phlomis) help reduce the 
drying effect of the wind and will reflect the sun's rays.</li> 
<li>Leathery or waxy leaves (such as bergenia and sedum) help prevent water 
loss and evaporation by the wind; they are usually grey in colour, ( like 
lavender, right) which will reflect the glare of the sun. A waxy or glaucous 
coating helps seal in moisture.</li> 
<li>Grasses and conifers have thin, needle-like leaves that lose very little 
water. Their leaves' small surface area prevents excess water loss through 
evaporation and some will roll their leaves inwards, reducing the surface even 
more.</li> 
<li>Some plants, like bottlebrushes (callistemon) or fennel (<em>Foeniculum 
vulgare</em>), reduce their leaf size so much that the stem turns green and 
takes over as the main photosynthesising organ.</li> 
<li>Storage organs can help a plant survive the driest periods by collecting 
water at times of plenty. They can be in the form of long tap roots (in plants 
like sea kale, Crambe maritima), or in bulbs, corms and tubers, such as alliums 
and eremurus. They will store enough food and water to ensure the plant has the 
energy to survive until the next rain.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Water saving notes</h2> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Plants need most water in hot, dry weather - when water companies 
are least able to supply the demand. At peak times, up to 70% of household 
water may be used in gardens.<br>
<br>
</strong></li> 
<li><em>Install as many water butts and tanks as possible to capture and store 
rainwater from times of plenty, for use during dry periods.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><strong>24,000 litres of water (enough to fill 150 water butts) could be 
collected from the roof of a small house each year.<br>
<br>
</strong></li> 
<li><em>Water with soap and detergents is harmless to plants and can 
supplement rainwater, but not water with bleach.<br>
<br>
</em></li> 
<li><strong>To reduce irrigation, use a thick mulch to limit evaporation from 
the soil. There are many types available - gravel, compost or bark - all of 
which aid soil water retention.</strong></li> </ol> <br>
