<i>We always seem to have too much or not enough. But water is the lifeblood of 
the garden and essential for good plant growth.<br>
<br>
It is ever more 
important today to use water wisely in the garden. Dramatic instances of water 
shortages and restrictions highlight how water-greedy some gardens can be. We 
look at different ways of reducing the amount of water we use, especially water 
from the tap.</i> <br>
<b>Water Wise</b> <br>
Watering the garden may sound 
simple, but different requirements require different solutions.<br>
<br>
It's 
not just standing there with the hose!<br>

<b>Water in the Cool of the Day
</b> <br>
One key factor to remember is that watering in the heat of the day is 
not as effective as morning or evening watering, as the sun will evaporate 
precious droplets, especially if you use a sprinkler. The water on the soil 
surface will also dry up more quickly. Much of the water you applied will be of 
no benefit to the plants.<br>
<br>
In very bright sunny weather, the water can 
actually scorch the plants, as the sun reflects on the water droplets.<br>
<br>

<b>Water Well Not Often</b> <br>
Water plants thoroughly each time and they 
will develop good, deep root systems. You can water less frequently if you give 
your plants a good soaking.<br>
<br>
Watering a little every day encourages 
lots of surface roots and the plants never really get enough moisture. If you 
merely wet the surface of the soil it will quickly dry out again, leaving 
plants gasping for water. Light surface watering encourages the roots towards 
the surface where they are more vulnerable to dryness and heat, rather than 
deeper into the soil.<br>
<br>
Watering with a strong force of water, or with 
large droplets, results in a crusty layer forming on the top of the soil. This 
is a barrier to subsequent watering or rain; it may prevent the essential 
exchange of air and gases. A surface 'crust' can be enough to prevent seedlings 
coming through the soil surface.<br>
<br>
<b>When to Water</b> <br>
When, and 
how often, to water is a question invites debate between gardeners.<br>
<br>

Don't expect the surface to be moist all of the time. The simplest method of 
testing the moisture content in the soil is by rolling a little bit of soil in 
your hand. Or you can dig about 8 - 10 cm (3 - 4 inches) into the soil and see 
what the moisture content is like beneath the surface. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Storing water</b> <br>
<br>
Water is a precious and expensive resource. There 
are a number of ways to increase your supply of water in the garden, without 
increasing the water bill.<br>
<br>
<b>Collecting Rainwater</b> <br>
Rainwater, 
free of chlorine and other chemicals used in treating mains supply water, is 
the choice of many for use in watering pot plants, seedlings and tricky, fussy 
plants.<br>
<br>
You can easily install a rain butt or barrel in your garden. 
Good looking traditional or modern rain butts are available for specialist 
merchants.<br>
<br>
A down pipe from your garden shed running into the barrel 
will collect rain water, a dipper is all that is needed to have a good supply 
of fresh, clear water.<br>
<br>
Even a large bucket left out on the terrace or 
outside the potting shed will fill with rainwater.<br>
<br>
<b>Using Rainwater 
Run-off</b> <br>
<br>
You can attach an 'elbow' to the bottom of the down pipes 
on your house, directing the water into the garden. Check that your local 
council allows this first!<br>
<br>
If you have heavy falls of rain you will 
need to install a system of dry streambeds (also called 'swales'), drains 
filled with gravel or sump holes to move water quickly and safely away from the 
house and border. The alternative is a potential for flooding and washouts in 
the border.<br>
<br>
And to reduce watering the lawn, when designing your paved 
driveway slope it towards the lawn, directing the rainwater onto the grass 
instead of into the storm water drains. Take care that the paving is higher 
enough and angled away from your house or garage, or you will find you are 
watering your cellar instead! <br>

<br>  With experience you will be able to judge the water needs of different 
areas within your garden. Keeping rainfall records, or checking the local 
paper, will tell you whether a shower wet or merely dampened the soil.<br>
<br>

Watering should be avoided during the heat of the day, should be deep enough to 
encourage deep root growth. You want to water the roots, rather than the leaves 
and certainly not have the water evaporate in the air before the plants can get 
to it. If only the soil surface is wet, it will soon dry out and the plant 
roots, where the water is best absorbed, will have received little or no 
moisture.<br>
<br>
As a rule 25mm (1 inch) of water is enough to penetrate the 
soil to a depth of 12-15cm (approx 1 foot) and that is sufficient for most 
grasses, ground covers and perennials. Trees and shrubs are more deeply rooted 
and need the water to penetrate further. <br>
<b>Watering Systems</b><br>
<br>

Traditional watering methods are wasteful of water and can cause other problems 
in especially dry climates. Spray irrigation can simply erode precious topsoil 
as it drains away. It can leach all the nutrients from a light sandy soil as it 
very quickly drains away. And, by watering a large area and not just the 
plants, spray irrigation can result in a burgeoning weed population, competing 
with your precious plants for water. <br>

<b>Compost</b> <br>
A late winter or spring compost mulch will not only reduce 
water loss through evaporation in the garden, it will improve soil structure, 
help water conservation in the soil and drainage.<br>
We keep saying it, but <b>
compost</b> is truly at the heart of the garden. <br>
