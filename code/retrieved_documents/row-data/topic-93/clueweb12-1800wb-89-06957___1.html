<blockquote> 
<p>Atmospheric water generating systems harvest&nbsp;fresh great tasting <em>
water from air</em>.&nbsp; Many people have no idea that the extracting 
&ldquo;water from air&rdquo; technology exists, and most&nbsp;people have no 
idea how much water is&nbsp;readily available in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere 
&ndash; there is over 3,100 cubic miles of water, or more than 3.4 quadrillion 
gallons at any one time in our atmosphere.&nbsp; The hydrologic cycle ensures 
that&nbsp;billions of gallons of water are evaporating into the atmosphere, 
condensating and then&nbsp;precipitating out of the&nbsp;air every day.&nbsp; 
This creates a&nbsp;never ending continuous supply of fresh water that&nbsp;is 
readily available and accessible almost everywhere in the world.&nbsp; 
Atmospheric water generators&nbsp;produce water similar to the way rain is made 
and&nbsp;are&nbsp;the most environmentally friendly water 
dispensing&nbsp;methods&nbsp;available on the market.&nbsp; The world 
desperately needs alternative &quot;water 
cultivation&quot;&nbsp;capabilities.&nbsp;Harvesting water from air is one of 
the most viable and sound solutions&nbsp;presented&nbsp;as the world&rsquo;s 
fresh water needs increase daily.&nbsp; The revolutionary technology makes 
available the ability to help meet, and fill the growing and and at times 
overwhelming demand for sustainalbe, economincal, and safe great tasting 
drinking water in an evironmentally responsible way.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 We know 
how important&nbsp;the&nbsp;availability of clean&nbsp;drinking&nbsp;water is 
to health and wellness for people everywhere.&nbsp; The atmospheric water 
generator is an environmentally safe&nbsp;source of sustainable water.&nbsp; It 
can be used solely for agriculture in which the use of our sophisticated water 
purification and water filtration methods aren't 
necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, when clean drinking water is&nbsp;essential 
the water created&nbsp;by the A.W.G. goes through both&nbsp;UV light, and/or 
Ozone water purification&nbsp;techniques&nbsp;in addition to the multi-step 
patented carbon&nbsp;water filtration system to produce 99% pure drinking 
water.&nbsp; The&nbsp;result&nbsp;of this blend&nbsp;of science and nature 
working together creates highly purified, filtered, and oxygenated water that 
tastes great!&nbsp; Water from air rivals any water on the market today on 
quality and&nbsp;purity.&nbsp; Our patented water purification systems and 
water filtration systems ensure the highest&nbsp;quality fresh water.&nbsp; 
However, unlike tap water or bottled water there is a distinct 
difference.&nbsp; Our water is evaporated and condensed, and at no time does it 
ever have chemicals used to treat it or&nbsp;in it that need to be removed or 
reduced like water that comes from a tap, well, lake, river, stream, ocean, etc.

<h2>How Atmospheric Water Generator Fresh Drinking Water 
Purification&nbsp;Systems, and Water Filtration Systems&nbsp;Can Improve Your 
Quality of&nbsp; Life!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating Very Healthy&nbsp; Water For 
Your Body! </h2> <strong><strong> 
<p></p> </strong></strong> 
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Water Factory&nbsp;Atmospheric Water Generatoring&nbsp;
</strong> <strong>technology</strong> pulls moisture&nbsp;out of&nbsp;the 
ambient air (water from air) similar to that of a dehumidifier and turns it 
into 99.9% clean drinking water.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the process of removing 
moisture from the air&nbsp;the air is first filtered then the&nbsp;water is 
thoroughly filtered and purified without using any chemicals.&nbsp; The A.W.G. 
system can also come&nbsp;with air conditioning capabilities.&nbsp; The air is 
then both cooled, filtered, purified, and dehumidified.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;
</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>The air is purified during this process</strong>
&nbsp;as it passes through&nbsp;an electrostatic filter which effectively 
removes dust, pollen, mold spores, bacteria, and other airborne particulates 
the water generator can also successfully serve as centralized air filtration 
and air purification.&nbsp; Our A.W.G. systems pre-filter and pre-clean the air 
in order to eliminate much of the unwanted, unhealthy particles prior to 
chlling the air and collecting the moisture for water purification and 
filtration. </p> 
<p><strong>The benefits of making water from air</strong> are tremendous 
combined with the&nbsp;fact that our atmospheric water makers don't need any 
outside source of water to function.&nbsp;&nbsp;Water from air is a completely 
sustainable,&nbsp;environmentally friendly source&nbsp;of water that is readily 
available for you to use everyday.&nbsp; You can have the most advanced&nbsp;
water filtration system or water purification system in the world that treats 
tap water, well water, etc.&nbsp; But&nbsp;no matter how good, efficient, or 
effective that system may be&nbsp;they&nbsp;all&nbsp;require an existing 
incoming source of&nbsp;readily available water to treat and purify.&nbsp; 
Our&nbsp;units give you the&nbsp;liberty to&nbsp;harvest the water, filter the 
water, and purify the water in one complete system.&nbsp; In the event of an 
emergency such as a terrorist attack, hurricane, tornado, water 
contamination,&nbsp;or something as simple as a broken water main&nbsp;that 
could disrupt water supplies; the depletion of&nbsp;existing water supplies 
(drought); or&nbsp;there&nbsp;simply is&nbsp;no existing&nbsp;water supplies 
available; water from air gives you the freedom to extract, harvest, and 
generate a sustainable daily supply without fear or worry of interuption. </p> 
<br> 
<p><strong>Greater energy efficiency</strong> by using the International Water 
From Air&nbsp;water factory.<strong>&nbsp;</strong> Our systems produce water 
and condition air simultaneously.&nbsp;Both functions&nbsp;utilize 
a&nbsp;single source of energy making our water machines a totally unique 
water&nbsp;harvesting, water filtration, water 
purification,&nbsp;air-conditioning, air-dehumidification, and air purification 
system&nbsp;contained in one complete package!&nbsp; Units are available with 
or without the air conditioning systems depending on your need and application.
&nbsp; We also make&nbsp;systems available&nbsp;without water filtration and 
water purification if your needs doesn't require potable water.&nbsp;
Atmospheric water generation is an environmentally friendly and 
&quot;green&quot; alternative water source for any&nbsp;person, business, or 
other entity wishing to maintain control over the purity and source of their 
water supply and&nbsp;the quality of their air, while using an electrically 
efficient system to do so.&nbsp;<br>

<h3>&nbsp;Here&nbsp;Are Just&nbsp;a few&nbsp;of the Benefits of Using the 
International Water From Air<br>
&nbsp;Atmospheric Water Generator&nbsp; </h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p><br>
<strong>Freedom&nbsp;and Independence&nbsp;from bottled water or 
ground water supplies.</strong>&nbsp; Traditional water filtration and water 
purification systems that treat tap water, well water, etc, still require an 
incoming source of ground water to treat and purify no matter how effective 
they may perform.&nbsp; Bottled water&nbsp;can&nbsp;be cumbersome, difficult to 
store, overpriced, and depletes existing ground water sources that are often 
siphoned off to manufacture the bottled water.&nbsp;Our systems manufacture the 
water, filter the water, and purify the water in one complete package.&nbsp; In 
the event of a national, or local emergency that could disrupt water supplies, 
or if there is non-existing water supplies, or limited access to water 
supplies, &ldquo;water from air,&rdquo; gives you the freedom to extract, 
harvest, and generate a sustainable daily supply of fresh water.<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Clean, pure drinking water not available anywhere else!&nbsp; 
</strong>The &quot;Water Factory&quot; extracts the water through a 
sophisticated condensation process and then filters and purifies the water 
prior to consumption.&nbsp; The exceptional technology removes all inorganic 
materials, undesirable odors, particulate matter&nbsp;as small as&nbsp;.01 
microns, and all forms of bacteria, metals, minerals, viruses and other 
elements that might pose any kind of health risk. The average TDS (Total 
Disolvable Solids) for our systems is 5.<br>
<br>
<strong>Water and your health.
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Water plays a major role in&nbsp;determining the quality 
of your overall health.&nbsp;A significant portion of our bodies are made up of 
water. Lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water. Blood contains 95% water, 
body fat contains 14% water, and bone has 22% water.&nbsp; Normally a baby is 
made-up of approximately 75% water, an adult male about 60%, and an adult 
female about 55% water.&nbsp; Water is the <em>essence of life </em>for all 
living organisms on our planet.&nbsp; Water is necessary in order for your body 
to digest foods and absorb vitamins and nutrients. These vitamins and nutrients 
increase your mental and physical performance, remove toxins and waste from 
your body, keep skin healthy and glowing, help in aid with weight loss, reduces 
headaches, and detoxifies the liver and kidneys.<br>
<br>
<strong>O
ur&nbsp;systems are environmentally safe, friendly, and responsible!&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong><strong> </strong>By producing water from the moisture in the air, we 
do not deplete water from natural resources (existing ground water 
supplies).&nbsp; This is an intelligent and responsible use of condensated 
water with no additives&nbsp;thus maintaining water purity.&nbsp; Our unique 
combination of<strong>water harvesting</strong>, <strong>water filtration
</strong>, and <strong>water purification systems</strong> will allow you the 
freedom to become completely self-sufficient and independent of any need for 
municipal water sources, well water, or other outside water sources,&nbsp;while 
delivering the absolute best tasting water you've ever had!&nbsp; As fresh 
water supplies dwindle, ground water is polluted, and bottled water threatens 
the environment, the A.W.G.&nbsp;makes available a healthy, more 
environmentally friendly, more sustainable water source&nbsp;that&nbsp;fuses 
nature and&nbsp;science together in a way never before seen that benefits all 
mankind!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Water from air</strong> for your whole 
house or&nbsp;building&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;air-conditioning creates a water 
making and&nbsp;air quality control system in&nbsp;one complete package!&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Our systems are also great for agricultural use as the systems can be 
designed solely for manufacturing non-potable water for crops.&nbsp; 
With&nbsp;I.W.F.A. atmospheric water generating system you can literally go off 
the grid when it comes to fresh water and fresh air.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our complete 
water generating,water purification, water filtration, air-conditioning, 
air-quality control systems will allow you to enjoy great tasting fresh water 
while creating a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;indoor environment as it produces fresh, 
clean high quality air for breathing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporate our systems with 
solar or wind turbine energy and you have created a completely off the grid 
sustainable, source of&nbsp;energy, water and conditioned air!&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<strong>The&nbsp;International Water From Air atmospheric water 
generating&nbsp;system</strong> is a literal &quot;water factory&quot; 
that&nbsp;replenishes it&rsquo;s water supplies daily.&nbsp; 
The&nbsp;multi-step&nbsp;air-water filtration,<strong><em>water 
purification&nbsp;system</em></strong>&nbsp;process allows&nbsp;you to 
continually&nbsp;produce purified,&nbsp;fresh&nbsp;filtered,&nbsp;crystal clear 
water&nbsp;that<strong>contains no</strong> <strong>undesirable chemicals

own environmentally friendly bottled water&nbsp;plant, and bottled water label
<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; The global&nbsp;fresh drinking water industry is the 
fastest growing part of the global economy second only to energy.&nbsp; It is 
anticipated by many highly regarded investment firms that the water sector will 
grow as much as times the global economy over the next 20 years with the 
bottled water industry leading the way!&nbsp; .<br>
<br>
 Make <strong><em>
environmentally friendly</em></strong>&nbsp;bottled water by using 98.5 % 
biodegradable bottles to contain the bottled water, while also producing 99.9% 
fresh pure water from air. One of the most important considerations for using 
atmospheric water generators to create bottled water is that there is<em>
<strong>n</strong></em><em><strong>o depletion of existing ground water supplies
</strong></em> or the need for any ground water at all since you will be 
harvesting fresh water from&nbsp;air.<strong> <br>
</strong><br>
 We have the 
technology to attach multiple units to a water bottling&nbsp;plant and produce 
the highly popular oxygenated&nbsp;&quot;bottled water&quot;&nbsp;for 
commercial sale. All the water is&nbsp;cultivated from moisture&nbsp;in the 
air.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can provide you with a complete automated bottling 
plant.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;available two different size systems that can be 
configured and made capable of producing&nbsp;up to 3,000&nbsp;bottles or up to 
5,000 per hour.&nbsp; Each plant is fully automated and will generate the 
water, blow mold the bottles, rinse, fill, cap, label, and package the bottled 
water for resale.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 You can make the water and system even more 
environmentally friendly and do&nbsp;away with the of use standard grid 
energy.&nbsp; For those that&nbsp;want to blaze a path&nbsp;and set a new 
standard in&nbsp;the bottled water industry&nbsp;you have the power<em>to 
create&nbsp;the most environmentally friendly bottled water in the 
world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;The system&nbsp;can be fully powered (making it 
ideal in locations where demand&nbsp;may be&nbsp;high, but normal grid energy 
is unreliable at best)&nbsp;usingsolar power and/or&nbsp;wind turbine energy.
