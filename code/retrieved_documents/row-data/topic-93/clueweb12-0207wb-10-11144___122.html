<p><b>Consolidated fire, ambulance</b></p> 
<p><b>services urged</b></p> 
<p><b>Health Services has not seen new proposal </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A proposal to consolidate fire and ambulance services in Pagosa Springs was 
presented to the fire protection district board of directors Tuesday night.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is for our information, nothing more,&quot; chairman Dick 
Moseley said prior to receiving the proposal. &quot;We're not going to take any 
action tonight.&quot;</p> 
<p>Volunteer Firefighter Mike Farrell, a former employee at Emergency Medical 
Services, gave each of the directors a three-page draft outlining a possible 
chain of command, general tax income and proposed staffing for a combined fire 
and EMS service.</p> 
<p>The chain of command included a district manager and fire chief under 
direction of the board, each running their own side of the district. A deputy 
chief for each department would assist them. Under the deputy chief, members of 
the fire department would continue to be volunteers, except for six firefighter 
EMTs. EMS would be served by six paramedics.</p> 
<p>Farrell also proposed salaries for one district secretary and an EMS 
billing clerk. He estimated total combined general tax revenue at $1.2 million. 
That did not include fees for service or other income for either district.</p> 
<p>In addition to the three page-proposal, Farrell provided the board two 
binders containing other relevant information, including Colorado Revised 
Statutes and some examples of other districts' consolidations.</p> 
<p>&quot;I came here from a department that combined fire and EMS and it ran 
very successfully,&quot; Farrell told the board. He asked directors to consider 
the concept in general and then make a decision.</p> 
<p>Currently, the ambulance service is part of the Upper San Juan Health 
Service District. That district's board is considering restructuring EMS using 
a six-point plan devised by a committee of citizens. However, that plan 
involves having ambulance services directed by Mercy Medical Center in Durango. 
Mercy Medical Center turned over its own ambulance service to Durango-area fire 
departments last year.</p> 
<p>Farrell said he had not yet approached the Upper San Juan Health Service 
District Board with his proposal.</p> 
<p>Fire district manager Diane Bower said consolidation was considered once 
before, several years ago, but the idea died in committee and was never brought 
to the board for a decision. Contracting with the health service district for 
the service was another option, she said. It was not clear how complicated an 
option that would be.</p> 
<p>The board agreed to read over the proposal and the information provided. 
Both Moseley and board member Dusty Pierce said a consolidation could be a two- 
or three- year process even if both boards agreed to the action.</p> 
<p>&quot;If one board took the initiative, then the other board has the 
opportunity to accept or reject the resolution,&quot; Moseley said. &quot;It's 
not a simple thing.&quot; Consolidations also sometimes require a vote by the 
people and changes to the levy, that could conflict with TABOR requirements.</p>

<p><b>Should PAWS get permit to use</b></p> 
<p><b>Dutton Creek? Comment sought</b></p> 
<p><b>By Sonja Hoie</b></p> 
<p><b>U.S. Forest Service</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa District of the San Juan National Forest proposes to issue a 
special use permit to the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District that would 
replace the existing use of the Dutton Ditch by the water district with an 
underground pipeline to meet its long-term domestic water demand in Pagosa 
Springs and vicinity.</p> 
<p>The Dutton Ditch diverts water from Fourmile Creek at a diversion 
approximately nine miles north of the town of Pagosa Springs. The ditch conveys 
water near the Four Mile and Plumtaw Roads approximately 5 miles to the Dutton 
Creek drainage that is tributary to Stevens Reservoir.</p> 
<p>Over the last 15 years the capacity of Dutton Ditch has declined from 
&plusmn;14 cubic feet per second to &plusmn;4 c.f.s. due to accumulation of 
sediment and difficulty in stabilizing the ditch at two locations within 
unstable hillsides.</p> 
<p>The proposed pipeline construction would include installation of pipeline 
18-24 inches in diameter, largely along Forest Service access roads for 
approximately 27,500 linear feet to a connection with the existing pipeline 
extension delivering water to Hatcher Reservoir.</p> 
<p>The new pipeline would extend beyond this point another &plusmn;3,500 
linear feet to a point near Dutton Creek at the National Forest boundary. The 
&plusmn;31,000 l.f. pipeline would be designed to allow conveyance of 20 c.f.s. 
of Dutton Ditch water rights.</p> 
<p>All diversions on National Forest System Lands would be subject to a bypass 
at Four Mile Creek to maintain a minimum flow of 3 c.f.s. at the Dutton Ditch 
diversion. The purpose of this minimum flow requirement is to maintain 
fisheries habitat in the Fourmile Creek. Establishment of this minimum flow is 
allowed for under the San Juan National Forest Land and Resource Management 
Plan, 1983, amended 1992.</p> 
<p>Proposed pipeline appurtenances could include collection inlets and feeder 
pipelines at small streams, or at Cade Creek, that are tributary to the 
existing Dutton Ditch as they are crossed by the new pipeline, turnouts to 
several creek drainages and associated pipeline pressure reducing valves, 
isolation valves, air/vacuum valves, blow-off valves, and energy dissipaters as 
needed.</p> 
<p>The collection points and associated water rights, referred to as 
side-water collection, will allow the district to capture and convey runoff 
from drainage basins that have contributed to the Dutton Ditch.</p> 
<p>Two proposed pipeline turnout structures as required by the district's 
water court decree for such side-water will allow releases of water into the 
Four Mile Creek and McCabe Creek drainage basins for the purpose of returning 
water to these stream systems as required by the district's decree upon request 
of the Colorado Division of Water Resources Division Engineer. </p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District is soliciting public comment on this proposal. 
Comments are needed by July 2, 2003. Address your comments to Sonja Hoie, 
Pagosa Ranger District, PO Box 310, Pagosa Springs, CO 81147, (970) 264-1512, 
or shoie@fs.fed.us.</p> 
<p>Comments received in response to this solicitation, including names and 
addresses of those who comment, will be considered part of the public record on 
these proposed actions and will be considered.</p>

<p><b>Downtown brewery plan </b></p> 
<p><b>clears schools' concerns </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Plans for a nearby brewery will not cause a problem for neighborhood 
schools.</p> 
<p>That was the conclusion passed on to members of the board of education for 
Archuleta District 50 Joint Tuesday by Superintendent Duane Noggle.</p> 
<p>He said he met with the firm's planner, Tony Simmons, and also attended the 
Pagosa Springs Planning Commission hearing on the proposal last week.</p> 
<p>It appears the business, planned west of The Rose Restaurant, will be a 
well-run operation and there will be no effect on students going to either the 
junior high, intermediate or county education center which are less than half a 
block away. </p> 
<p>Noggle said the planning commission is recommending approval of the project 
by the town board which will consider the recommendation at its July 1 meeting.
</p> 
<p>He noted there will be several codicils on the approval, if received, 
including one which would make the permit nontransferable. That means the 
business could not be sold to a different owner and continue as a brewery.</p> 
<p>Board directors took no action on the report.</p>

<p><b>Education budget steered to even keel</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It wasn't an easy task, in fact one might have called it daunting.</p> 
<p>But the financial status of Archuleta School District 50 Joint has been 
kept on an even keel for the upcoming year through a series of tweaks, slashes, 
shifts and tightened spending.</p> 
<p>The board of education passed a budget and accompanying appropriations 
ordinance Tuesday which keeps the general fund budget at $14.5 million, the 
same as this year.</p> 
<p>Overall, the budget will total $20.9 million with projected equalized 
funding revenue of $9.29 million with 45 percent from the state and 55 percent 
from local taxes.</p> 
<p>Equalized funding is a combination of property tax, specific ownership tax 
and state aid determined by state law.</p> 
<p>All the juggling to make ends meet was a task assigned to Nancy Schutz, 
school district business manager, and the board was fully cognizant of that 
fact.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't know where we'd be without her,&quot; said director Clifford 
Lucero.</p> 
<p>And director Carol Feazel was thrilled with the presentation in an easily 
understandable format that &quot;make's it easy for us to know what we have, 
where it's going, and what we may need.&quot;</p> 
<p>The budget as adopted reflects per pupil operating revenue of $5,522.66.</p>
<p>In addition to the general fund total, the budget includes:</p> 
<p>- preschool funding of $65,000 which represents a cut of three preschool 
slots for the coming year </p> 
<p>- grants fund of $650,000 which includes all local, state and federal grants
</p> 
<p>- capital reserve fund of $1.375 million which incudes TABOR mandated 
non-appropriated reserve of $505,000 and covers all capital expenses including 
a special needs bus, completion of athletic field improvements and the joint 
raw water project with the town and Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District
</p> 
<p>- bond redemption fund of $1.75 million which pays on the 1996 bond issue 
for the new high school. It was noted the mill levy for this bond has dropped 
from over 10 at the beginning to 4.4 in this budget</p> 
<p>- food service of $425,000 for all operations of the food service program. 
To facilitate this, the board later approved a recommended increase of 25 cents 
at all meals bringing totals to $1.25 for breakfast in all schools and setting 
lunch fees at $1.50 in K-4, $1.75 for intermediate and junior high schools, $2 
for high school students and $3 for adults (federal law mandates adults pay 
more to compensate for commodities intended for student use). It is the first 
fee increase in the program in five years</p> 
<p>- $1.025 million in the trust/donation fund which includes the Whit Newton 
and Mooney donations, each with specific use requirements and mandatory 
reserves of $700,000 </p> 
<p>- insurance fund totaling $900,000 for employee self-insured and dental 
plan. The district pays claims for employee and dependents with reinsurance for 
claims in excess of $50,000. In conjunction with this fund, Schutz noted 
dramatic increases in insurance costs with workmen's compensation coverage up 
100 percent, health coverage up 20 percent and auto, property and structural 
coverage up 14 percent</p> 
<p>- a student activity fund of $210,000 to assist all self-supporting clubs 
and classes</p> 
<p>What it all boils down to is an accompanying appropriation of $18.575 
million representing budgeted spending not including transfers and reserves. 
For example, the general fund appropriation is $13.38 million compared to the 
budgeted $14.5 million.</p> 
<p>The only other major difference was between capital reserve budgeted 
($1.375 million) and appropriated ($870,000) much of that already committed for 
the athletic field and track improvements.</p> 
<p>Schutz noted that despite presumed recovery in some markets, interest 
income on investments is still way down, textbook funding was cut by the state 
and transportation cost support is going to drop from the current 74 percent.
</p> 
<p>She also noted the state projects a decrease in local enrollment of 23 for 
the coming school year. &quot;But we don't know where they get their 
figures,&quot; she said. &quot;We anticipate an actual increase. And other 
districts in the area with projected decreases are seeing the same probable 
increases.&quot;</p> 
<p>Staffing changes incorporated into the budget include cutting two teachers 
in the elementary school hired to reduce class size who are no longer eligible 
under federal experience mandates; adding an English as a second language 
teacher and a half-time kindergarten teacher under an NCLB grant and 
transferring the special education teacher to the intermediate school. </p> 
<p>At the intermediate level, one sixth-grade teacher position was eliminated. 
At the junior high, a cheerleading sponsor was added after having been dropped 
in a budgetary move last year; and at the high school a part-time teacher and 
an auditorium manager were added.</p> 
<p>In conjunction with future budgeting, director Randall Davis, asked 
transportation director Dolly Martin to conduct a study of her department and 
see if there are any routes which can be cut because of low use.</p> 
<p>She agreed to do so, but warned &quot;there will be parental repercussion 
in some areas if we cut.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have some routes with more than 100 signed up to ride but 
regularly we carry on 40 or so,&quot; Martin said. &quot;We have others where 
long distances are required to reach two or three children. Cutting there might 
be a hardship for parents.&quot;</p> 
<p>Overall, Martin said, there may be other areas in her department where cuts 
can be made.</p> 
<p>&quot;I will work up something to indicate possibilities,&quot; she told 
the board.</p> 
<p>Lucero said some cuts may be necessary, &quot;even if it hurts. We need to 
know what can be done if we have to do it.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Sunshine, dry conditions forecast for Pagosa Country</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>After being buffeted by occasional high winds that gave rise to dust clouds 
and lowered humidity levels during the past week, Pagosa Country should be the 
recipient of a calmer, less animated weather scenario throughout the next seven 
days.</p> 
<p>While the forecast predicts breezy conditions will subside as the week 
progresses, indications are the region will not benefit from significant 
amounts of precipitation.</p> 
<p>&quot;We don't anticipate much in the way of widespread rainfall in the 
next few days,&quot; said Ellen Heffernan, a forecaster with the National 
Weather Service Office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;We do expect a few afternoon thunderstorms across the San Juans, but 
any showers should be brief and very isolated,&quot; added Heffernan.</p> 
<p>&quot;There will be a few clouds (today) and into Friday, but the rest of 
the week looks to be less windy, mainly clear and dry - a typical mid-June 
pattern for southwest Colorado,&quot; concluded Heffernan.</p> 
<p>According to Heffernan, mostly sunny skies will be the norm through this 
morning while a few clouds will be a possibility this afternoon.</p> 
<p>High temperatures are predicted in the mid-70s to low 80s. Nighttime lows 
are expected to descend into the mid-30s to low 40s.</p> 
<p>Friday's forecast indicates a high probability for mostly-sunny skies, 
highs in the 75-85 range and lows in the 40s.</p> 
<p>Saturday and Sunday call for abundant sunshine, highs in the lower 80s and 
lows in the upper 30s. </p> 
<p>The forecasts for Monday and Tuesday predict continued sunny conditions, 
highs in the low to mid-80s and lows in the 40s.</p> 
<p>A 30-percent chance for rain is included in Wednesday's forecast; highs 
should climb into the mid-80s while lows should fall to around 40.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week at Stevens Field was 74 
degrees. The average low was 36. Precipitation for the week amounted to zero.
</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the current area fire danger as 
&quot;high.&quot; Conditions are subject to change rapidly this time of year; 
for updates, call the district office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>Water temperature in Navajo Reservoir is reportedly in the 60s, and the 
lake's surface level is currently listed at an elevation of 6,018 feet and 
rising. The boat ramp at Navajo State Park is open.</p> 
<p>The National Allergy Bureau rates area pollen counts as &quot;high&quot; 
and lists oak and grass as the current dominant pollens.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow ranged between approximately 600-1,500 cubic feet per 
second last week. The river's historic median flow for mid-June is roughly 
1,450 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>June is a big month for planning and playing in our various departments. We 
have so much preparation for the Fourth of July celebration, it gets exhausting 
thinking about it.</p> 
<p>Knowing the joy the Fourth brings to so many people makes it easier to come 
to work and continue the annual process.</p> 
<p>Those of us who have experienced a Fourth of July in Pagosa, no matter what 
our age, remember all the friends and family who gather in our small town.</p> 
<p>In the parks department, Jim Miller is watering, weeding, painting and 
putting a crew together for the busiest three days of the year.</p> 
<p>I'm meeting with Pagosa Lodge officials, fire officials, fireworks experts, 
carnival officials, trying to make sure everyone is doing what they are 
supposed to be doing to make sure we have a great parade, carnival, arts and 
craft show and, finally, the grand finale - the fireworks.</p> 
<p>This year we have upgraded the pyrotechnics show, which will be held at the 
Pagosa Lodge, Pinon Lake site.</p> 
<p>Chris Corcoran is in full swing with little league baseball and adult 
softball, four nights a week.</p> 
<p>Park Fun is going strong with over 30 kids enjoying a variety of 
educational and recreational activities.</p> 
<p>During Mel Montoya's absence we have put together a strong team of seasonal 
workers: Dylan Pruitt, Lisa Jensen and, most recently Jim Shaffer the high 
school basketball coach.</p> 
<p>With the &quot;A-Team&quot; in place we anticipate a great summer of 
activities, with the public enjoying clean park facilities and a great holiday 
weekend.</p> 
<p><b>Basketball camp</b> </p> 
<p>Jim Shaffer is the true crossover employee in our department. </p> 
<p>He will serve in the parks department all summer. With a flexible schedule 
and the town of Pagosa Springs cosponsoring the annual Pirate Basketball Camp, 
Jim will move into the recreation field, along with Lady Pirate head coach Bob 
Lynch, and host a basketball camp for youngsters in third through eighth 
grades, June 16-19.</p> 
<p>Cost of the four-day camp is $50 per youngster. The price includes a 
T-shirt, basketball and many hours of great instruction. Compare that to costs 
in neighboring towns and you'll find quite a value right here in Pagosa Springs.
</p> 
<p>For more information please call Jim or Bob at the following numbers, Jim 
at 264-5070, Bob at 731-3007. </p> 
<p><b>Fishing derby</b></p> 
<p>Get your straw hats and&nbsp; overalls out for the annual Huck Finn-Becky 
Thatcher look-alike contest and fishing derby. This year we will offer free 
fishing poles to all children 16 and younger, thanks to the Colorado Division 
of Wildlife.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Free hot dogs, chips and soda will be available compliments of the local 
chapter of the Turkey Federation. This group wants to let the kids know about 
the chapter and get involved with outdoor education of our youngsters.</p> 
<p>What better way to reach the children than to get involved with the 
Division of Wildlife and the town of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p><b>Park survey</b> </p> 
<p>Every once in a while I want to let the public know what is going on in the 
parks and recreation world.</p> 
<p>Noticing last week's letter to the editor I looked up some facts.</p> 
<p>In 2000 the town board of trustees, the Parks Advisory Council, and the 
parks and recreation department, conducted a survey concerning what the public 
wanted in the field of recreation.</p> 
<p>The survey said: </p> 
<p>- 86 percent of the people surveyed wanted River Walk extension. The 2003 
budget includes plans for such an extension, from behind the Springs south to 
the Apache Street bridge</p> 
<p>- 70 percent wanted a community center, and it opened Aug. 10, 2002 </p> 
<p>- 69 percent wanted a Teen Center, and it opened Aug. 10, 2002 </p> 
<p>- 56 percent wanted&nbsp; more athletic fields </p> 
<p>- 51 percent wanted a skate board park, which was constructed using $10,000 
from the 2002 budget and numerous hours of volunteer labor.</p> 
<p>- 50 percent wanted a covered ice skating facility </p> 
<p>- 29 percent wanted tennis courts. </p> 
<p>Of the needs featured in the survey, town officials have made five out of 
the seven top choices a reality. If the needs of the top five vote-getters, 
have not been satisfied yet, they&nbsp; are in the planning stages.</p> 
<p>I commend our town leaders for listening to the public and getting the job 
done.</p> 
<p>In my research I found out that Durango, with a service population 5-6 
times larger than Pagosa, has eight tennis courts, all but two on school 
property. Last year in a co-op effort, the county, school and city used 
approximately $550,000 from an account to which each party contributes $100,000 
per year for joint effort projects.</p> 
<p>The agencies agreed last year to make upgrades on school-owned tennis 
courts, and allow the public to play free. The amount given to the capital 
investment fund each year is 10 times greater than the amount Archuleta County 
and the town of Pagosa Springs has available to put into such an account.</p> 
<p>So, with the fund-raising efforts of our town fathers and mothers we have 
accomplished quite a bit in the past three years.</p>

<p><b>Team Pagosa dedicates this year's Courage Classic ride to David Mitchell
</b></p> 
<p><b>By Doug Call</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>This summer will mark the fifth year Team Pagosa will ride in the Courage 
Classic, the Children's Hospital Foundation fund-raiser bicycle ride.</p> 
<p>The ride is held July 19-21 in Summit County which hosts about 50 teams and 
800 riders, all raising money for the hospital in Denver.</p> 
<p>Last year, Team Pagosa's crew consisted of nine riders who raised $3,445, 
an average of $383 per rider. The goal for this year's team is to raise $1,000 
per rider.</p> 
<p>Missing from last year's team, and the original founder of Team Pagosa, is 
Dave Mitchell. This year's ride will be dedicated to him and all pledges and 
donations accepted in his name will be donated to the Children's Hospital 
Foundation.</p> 
<p>Dave rode in his 12th Courage Classic last year as the original member of 
Team Pagosa. He inspired all of us to not only ride our bicycles, but to ride 
for a purpose. His purpose in riding and formulating the team was to help the 
children. He had several he rode for.</p> 
<p>His big heart inspired us to continue Team Pagosa and dedicate this year's 
ride to him. Riding without him this year will be truly sad.</p> 
<p>Riding the Courage Classic consists of three days of road riding on state 
highways and bicycle trails, starting and ending in Leadville.</p> 
<p>Day one consists of a 48-mile ride around Turquoise Lake, over Fremont Pass 
and into Copper Mountain Resort. Day two starts at Copper Mountain and goes 
through Frisco, Breckenridge, Keystone and around Lake Dillon, 54 miles plus a 
20-mile option up Loveland Pass, which was one of Dave's favorite routes.</p> 
<p>The final day, July 21, is the longest day with 60 miles of riding. From 
Copper Mountain, it climbs 10,666-foot Vail Pass and winds into Minturn for a 
final climb over Tennessee Pass and back into Leadville.</p> 
<p>At the finish line, all teams gather, eat lunch and cheer for Team Courage, 
a team composed of children from the hospital.</p> 
<p>The event is truly a worthy cause and well worth riding in - or donating to.
</p> 
<p>Cyclists interested in joining Team Pagosa can call Doug Call at 731-9245. 
They must register by June 17 to join in the Dave Mitchell memorial ride.</p> 
<p>Donations for the Courage Classic should be made to the Children's Hospital 
Foundation and can be given to any team member: The Rays, Monjaras, Hopkins and 
Calls, Margaret Burkensmith, Jim Gregory, Gary McNaughton, Connie Chubbuck, Tim 
Decker and other team members.</p>

<p><b>County enacts new open burning regulation</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Effective immediately, a new stipulation included as part of a fire 
ordinance adopted by the Archuleta County commissioners last week requires 
residents to notify the sheriff's office before initiating open burns anywhere 
within the county.</p> 
<p>Specifically, the regulation reads &quot;No person or entity shall permit 
or allow any open burning to occur on any private property within the 
unincorporated areas of Archuleta County without first having notified the 
Archuleta County Sheriff's Office by telephoning dispatch at (970) 264-2131 
...&quot;</p> 
<p>The language applies to all county residents, regardless of whether or not 
they live within the boundaries of the Pagosa Fire Protection or Los Pinos Fire 
Protection districts.</p> 
<p>Those contacting dispatchers will be required to advise them of the date, 
time and location of the intended burn and confirm whether or not a fire ban or 
restrictions on open burns are in place. No fees or special permits will be 
required for such burns.</p> 
<p>Bill Steele, county administrator, said the requirement for prior 
notification before burning is aimed at avoiding false alarms while enabling 
dispatchers to advise residents of potentially dangerous conditions before 
&quot;ditch burns&quot; or similar burns are conducted.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's kind of a heads-up, the intent is that it will prevent rushing 
out to put out a 'wildfire' if we don't have to,&quot; said Steele. &quot;This 
way, we can let people know whether or not and where controlled burns are 
occurring when they call in and say they see smoke at a particular location.</p>
<p>&quot;It also gives dispatchers the chance - if someone calls in and says 
they want to conduct a burn - to say, 'We have high winds in the forecast; 
please wait until tomorrow,' etc.,&quot; added Steele.</p> 
<p>Also included in the ordinance, which was approved at a special meeting of 
the board Thursday, are provisions that enable the commissioners to authorize a 
countywide fire ban and prohibit the sale of fireworks if necessary.</p> 
<p>In other business last week the board:</p> 
<p>- (Tuesday) scheduled a workshop regarding county land use regulations and 
limited impact use permits for 7 p.m. June 18</p> 
<p>-&nbsp;adopted a new compensation plan for county employees after reviewing 
an analytical salary survey and corresponding recommendations from Lee &amp; 
Burgess Associates LLC</p> 
<p>- approved the application for a Colorado Department of Transportation 5311 
Grant (discretionary transit funding)</p> 
<p>- approved the extension of the performance bond for the Ridgeview 
subdivision through Aug. 31, 2003 in order to allow enough time to define the 
scope of additional work/construction needed to complete repairs on portions of 
Navajo Trail Drive</p>

<p><b>Couple hurt as cars, motorcycle collide</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Two motorcyclists were seriously injured in a head-on collision at U.S. 160 
and Meadows Drive June 7.</p> 
<p>According to Colorado State Patrol reports, Rudolph and Deena Janzen, of 
Alberta, Canada were eastbound on U.S. 160 on a Honda motorcycle when a vehicle 
was pushed into their lane.</p> 
<p>The resulting collision caused the motorcycle to roll over and slide 30 
feet. The Janzens were both ejected and landed in a ditch about 50 feet from 
the point of impact. Both were wearing helmets and eye protection, a fact 
Trooper Doug Wiersma said could have saved their lives.</p> 
<p>&quot;This was a very serious crash, but could have been even more serious 
and possibly even fatal if seatbelts and helmets had not been used,&quot; he 
said.</p> 
<p>The accident actually involved two other vehicles, one that stopped and one 
that didn't.</p> 
<p>According to the reports, William Siebert, 64, of McKinney, Texas, was 
driving west and failed to stop for another westbound vehicle waiting to turn 
onto Meadows Drive. That vehicle, a 2003 Toyota sedan, was driven by Barbara 
Sanborn, 56, of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Siebert's Ford Expedition hit the rear of the stopped car and pushed it 
into the eastbound lane where it collided with the motorcycle. Seibert was 
cited for careless driving causing injury. Both he and his passenger, Kay 
Seibert, 66, suffered minor injuries in the crash. Sanborn also received minor 
injuries. All three were wearing seatbelts.</p> 
<p>Rudolph Janzen, 61, was transported by ambulance to Mercy Medical Center in 
Durango. His passenger, Deena Janzen, 53, was flown to the same hospital by 
helicopter. Both were in serious condition following the accident. They have 
since been transferred to Denver Health Medical Center and were listed in fair 
condition Wednesday morning.</p> 
<p>Alcohol is not suspected as a factor in the incident.</p>

<p><b>Go fish: regional conditions improving daily</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>For anglers, the dwindling snowpack across the San Juan Mountains tells a 
bittersweet tale - the odds are slim southwest Colorado will escape from the 
grip of extreme drought this summer, but prime fishing conditions are just a 
week or so away.</p> 
<p>After hitting peak flows in the past two weeks, area rivers and streams are 
settling down and water clarity is improving daily.</p> 
<p>Reservoir fishing continues to improve as well. Warm-water species are 
becoming more aggressive as water temperatures rise, while trout are seeking 
deeper water midday and feeding aggressively in the shallows during early 
morning hours and near dusk.</p> 
<p>The following is a breakdown of conditions at some regional fishing 
hotspots:</p> 
<p>- Echo Lake - The lake is warming and largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish and 
perch are being taken on live bait, ultralight jigs and small plastics. Trout 
are hitting flies, marabou jigs, spinners in gold and silver, fluorescent 
Z-Rays, salmon eggs, nightcrawlers and PowerBait.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek Reservoir - Fishing for rainbow, cutthroat and brook trout 
is good in the early morning and late afternoon with live bait, light jigs in 
orange and yellow, and spinners in gold, silver and bright fluorescents. 
Kokanee salmon are holding deep, but some anglers are having occasional success 
near the inlet with flashy spoons and pop gear.</p> 
<p>- Navajo Reservoir - Water temperature is rising and catfish are regularly 
being caught day and night on blood/stink baits near the river inlets and in 
the shallows. Smallmouth bass, crappie and pike are being caught near rocky 
outcroppings and underwater brush.</p> 
<p>- Piedra River - Clearing water above the confluence with Williams Creek, 
murky below. Browns and rainbows are the predominant catch and are hitting 
flies, streamers and flashy spinners.</p> 
<p>- Middle Fork, Piedra River - Running high, clear and cold. Small browns 
and rainbows are being taken on flies and small jigs and spinners in the side 
eddies and plunge pools.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek - Fishing well below the dam; clarity is good for the 
first few miles but water remains murky farther downstream. Flies and small 
spinners are working well for brookies, cutthroats, browns and rainbows in the 
upper reaches, while mainly browns and rainbows are being taken near the lower 
campgrounds.</p> 
<p>- San Juan River (through town) - River is falling and clearing, and 
fishing is improving daily. Spinners, flies, marabou jigs and streamers are 
attracting rainbows and a few browns. River will be stocked later this month.

<p><b>Merchants plant new trout supply in San Juan</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>After getting the go-ahead from the Colorado Division of Wildlife, numerous 
local businesses are donating to a special program designed to improve fishing 
opportunities in the San Juan River.</p> 
<p>As a result of the effort to initiate the &quot;Pagosa Quality Fishing 
Project,&quot; approximately 500 pounds of rainbow trout will be released June 
23 in the portion of the river flowing between the U.S. 84-160 intersection and 
the footbridge behind the county courthouse.</p> 
<p>Spearheading the private stocking effort, which is aimed at augmenting the 
DOW's scheduled releases and restoring local trout populations that suffered 
during last year's record drought, are Larry Fisher and Thaddeus Cano.</p> 
<p>&quot;We started looking into this in February,&quot; said Cano, &quot;And 
the Division thought it was a fantastic idea as well, so we went forward 
through the permitting process and started working out the particulars.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Cano indicated at least 14 area businesses have contributed to the cause, 
and explained the fish, which are certified as whirling-disease free, will be 
transported from a trout farm in Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>&quot;Most of the trout will be in the 11- to 13-inch range,&quot; added 
Cano, &quot;But we'll also release 10 to 15 fish weighing in the neighborhood 
of five or six pounds.&quot;</p> 
<p>Subsequent stockings will depend on the amount of donations received, said 
Cano, since the cost for the trout is $3 per pound and $100 for delivery.</p> 
<p>&quot;The average donation has been about $100, and all are greatly 
appreciated,&quot; said Cano, adding that donations have ranged anywhere from 
$50 to $1,000 and that the year-to-date total for contributions amounts to 
$3,500. Anyone interested in donating to the program can contact Cano at 
264-2370.</p> 
<p>If the project continues, there is a good chance anglers seeking to hook up 
with both brown and rainbow trout without leaving town limits will meet with 
success through the fall - especially since the division is planning additional 
stockings of both species in the coming months.</p> 
<p>&quot;The plan is to stock 2,500 10-inch rainbows from state hatcheries in 
the San Juan River on four occasions, beginning in late June,&quot; said Mike 
Japhet, a fisheries biologist with the division office in Durango.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll also stock about 7,000 3-inch browns and roughly 5,000 Colorado 
River rainbow fingerlings, probably sometime in September,&quot; added Japhet, 
explaining the latter are a special strain, highly adapted to river life and 
expected to achieve higher survival rates.</p>

<p><b>Beetle epidemic: seek treatments, hope for best</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>They are mere millimeters in size but number in the millions, and the 
effects of their destructive infestation across a huge swath of southwestern 
Colorado have become more and more visible with the passing of each month.</p> 
<p>Usually referred to as &quot;bark beetles&quot; or &quot;engraver 
beetles,&quot; their scientific namesakes include &quot;ips confusus&quot; and 
&quot;ips calligraphus.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although they are native to the area, in the past few years a lingering 
drought has enabled the beetles to flourish disproportionately and wreak havoc 
on weakened populations of pinon and ponderosa pine.</p> 
<p>After taking refuge in brownish dead and dying trees throughout the winter 
months, they emerge when springtime temperatures consistently climb into the 50 
to 60-degree range to seek out new breeding grounds.</p> 
<p>And they have staked a claim in Pagosa Country.</p> 
<p>Their arrival has not gone without notice, however, and Chimney Rock 
Archaeological Area provided the setting this week for the latest in a series 
of regional battles pitting the ravenous insects against humans.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's a huge problem,&quot; says Glen Raby, Chimney Rock site manager. 
&quot;They're into stands of ponderosa and pinon at several locations within 
the area.&quot;</p> 
<p>In an effort to curb the spread of the beetle epidemic, said Raby, a 
state-licensed applicator sprayed the largest and healthiest of the area's 
trees with carbaryl, an insecticide which is also commonly known as sevin.</p> 
<p>Raby indicated the treatment is aimed at saving what the Pagosa Ranger 
District referred to as &quot;the most aesthetically pleasing trees at the 
site&quot; while reducing the potential hazards resulting from the beetles' 
continued onslaught.</p> 
<p>One such threat is the increased risk of infected trees serving as the 
catalyst for wildfire, since they become tinder dry after dying and remain so 
for many years before decay sets in.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're just trying to treat groups of trees that haven't been infected 
yet and hope for the best,&quot; said Raby, who added a second spraying will be 
scheduled for later this summer.</p> 
<p>The beetles can reproduce at a rate of 2-4 generations per year under the 
proper conditions, and according to the ranger district, only a sharp decrease 
in average winter temperatures or a prolonged period of wet weather will help 
slow their spread.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of beetle infestation include small round holes in the trees' bark 
and a yellowish to reddish-brown dust accumulating in crevices or at the bases 
of the trees.</p> 
<p>Another indication of infection is an increase in the number of woodpeckers 
becoming attracted to the trees and stripping the bark to get at the beetles.
</p> 
<p>While there are currently no effective remedies for trees that are already 
infected with the insects, Raby said the same treatment services used at 
Chimney Rock are available to the public.</p> 
<p>&quot;For safety purposes, I think it's probably better to use someone who 
is licensed,&quot; said Raby. &quot;It's not something you want to mess with if 
you are not sure exactly how to proceed.&quot;</p> 
<p>For those who are willing to tackle the problem by themselves, the 
following is a list of suggestions provided by the Colorado State University 
Cooperative Extension:</p> 
<p>- Obtain an insecticide containing either permethrin of carbaryl (sevin) 
and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the proper rate for bark 
beetle treatment.</p> 
<p>- Promote vigorous tree growth by properly siting/spacing trees in 
landscapes. Use adequate - but not excessive - amounts of water thereafter.</p> 
<p>- Do not store firewood or freshly-cut materials near susceptible trees. 
Fresh branches and other green materials should be chipped or treated so that 
the inner bark area is destroyed; beetle larvae will not survive such measures.
</p> 
<p>- No chemical treatment exists for trees already infested by the beetles. 
In rare cases where it is feasible to reduce the threat to live trees by 
killing beetles before they exit, treatments involve bark removal, chipping the 
wood into small pieces, covering piles with a double layer of 6-millimeter 
thick clear plastic sealed around the edges with soil to heat the wood, or 
physical removal of infested material from the site to an area a mile or more 
from susceptible trees.</p>

<p><b>Foreign language, student television projects get kudos</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A pair of teacher-planned projects were approved and given high praise 
Tuesday by directors of Archuleta School District 50 Joint.</p> 
<p>A new foreign language curriculum developed by teacher Kathy Isberg and 
Bill Esterbrook, high school principal, was lauded as &quot;above and beyond 
the call.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We wanted to meet new state standards,&quot; said Superintendent 
Duane Noggle, &quot;and they took us above and beyond. It was a very thorough 
job that deserves our special commendation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Esterbrook, however, gave the bulk of the credit to Mrs. Isberg.</p> 
<p>&quot;She did the real work,&quot; he said. &quot;She has worked the last 
seven years to bring a comprehensive curriculum to these kids and this program 
is her design. She deserves any and all kudos.&quot;</p> 
<p>With that in mind, the board of education formally approved the curriculum 
and directed the administration to go ahead with necessary textbook purchases.
</p> 
<p>The second program lauded was the broadcast technology program headed by 
teacher Curtis Maberry.</p> 
<p>He made a short presentation to the board outlining a proposal to take a 
team of Pagosa Springs students to the first ever Student Television Network 
annual convention next January in Los Angeles.</p> 
<p>On the agenda as simple approval of an administrative leave of absence for 
Maberry to attend the conference, the item quickly became focus of plaudits for 
involving youth in Pagosa in a groundbreaking program, much of it done on their 
own time.</p> 
<p>Maberry said he had initially intended to ask the district to fund the trip 
for all involved, but quickly realized it would be improper.</p> 
<p>&quot;They will raise their own personal funds,&quot; he told the board, 
&quot;approximately $630 per student if the trip is allowed.&quot;</p> 
<p>He noted there will be competitions for them to enter and prizes available 
to winners.</p> 
<p>It is the culmination of a dream that began as a part-time assignment and 
has grown into a student favorite, Maberry said.</p> 
<p>Just three days before the end of school Maberry put out a single 
announcement about the plans and got more than 20 responses for students 
interested in participating. </p> 
<p>Selection of those who would go on the trip, he said, would be on a 
progressive point system involving past participation, planned programming, 
performance and desire. Those not making enough points to go the first year 
would continue to accumulate points for trips in succeeding years.</p> 
<p>The board was told the fund-raising would qualify as the lone such event 
for the high school this year. </p> 
<p>While not giving formal approval, the board did grant Maberry's leave of 
absence and indicated it will approve the trip if students selected raise the 
funds necessary.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa High Television program presents five to six films a year with 
students volunteering to work on their own time to make their programming more 
complete.</p> 
<p>The program is not directly funded in the district budget but gets 
assistance through co-op programs with other districts.</p> 
<p>The students are now utilizing four mini-dv cameras, six digital editing 
stations, and a variety of other broadcast equipment.</p> 
<p>Maberry said the California conference has the student network teaming with 
a number of professional organizations including the Radio-Television News 
Directors Association, National Television Academy Foundation and the Annenburg 
School of Journalism at the University of Southern California. </p> 
<p>Board members were effusive in praise of the program and one, Carol Feazel, 
suggested the programs should be must viewing for board members.</p> 
<p>&quot;It has been a tremendous way to get youngsters involved in modern 
technology,&quot; added director Clifford Lucero.</p>

<p><b>Stadium improvements should be complete by fall season</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Some school board members are concerned about completion of athletic 
facility improvements at Golden Peaks stadium in time for fall action.</p> 
<p>And two members of the board for Archuleta District 50 Joint expressed 
concerns Tuesday for safety of players.</p> 
<p>Director Randall Davis asked for an update on track construction progress, 
noting he's seen stacks of stone and dirt on the track.</p> 
<p>&quot;Are we on schedule?&quot; he asked.</p> 
<p>Superintendent Duane Noggle said the track area will get a final pavement 
layer next week. It must cure for six weeks and then the track surface will be 
added.</p> 
<p>&quot;All should be done by Aug. 1,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>Director Jon Forrest was the first to express safety concerns.</p> 
<p>&quot;The south end runway construction for long jump and triple jump still 
has concrete standing six to eight inches higher then field level,&quot; he 
said.</p> 
<p>Both he and director Clifford Lucero argued this is unsafe for any athlete 
playing on the field, either in football or soccer.</p> 
<p>&quot;I thought elimination of that danger was part of the reason we 
approved the added $12,000 work order last month,&quot; Forrest said.</p> 
<p>The fall sports seasons will be on us sooner than we think,&quot; he noted 
and &quot;we want to be ready.&quot;</p> 
<p>Noggle assured directors the project will be done. It will include removal 
of sod out to the 20 yard line and recrowning of the playing area with an 
inclined approach to the cement that should eliminate the danger factor.</p> 
<p>Forrest, was still not satisfied. </p> 
<p>&quot;I'd think that if the project had been leveled to begin with, the 
stripping of turf and fill would not be necessary.&quot;</p> 
<p>Noggle insisted the field level drops off to the south, but the track is 
level at each end. &quot;Drainage is a key element to the project,&quot; he 
said, &quot;and if it is not properly tiered it can result in undermining the 
new surface.&quot;</p> 
<p>Still, Lucero was worried.</p> 
<p>&quot;Are we going to fix the safety hazard or not?&quot; he asked. 
&quot;It is dangerous now to anyone playing there.&quot; </p> 
<p>Noggle said Davis Engineering and Rob Keating, representing the general 
contractor, &quot;say the grade is right on and we'll be able to eliminate any 
safety factor with the work in progress.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;That's what I wanted to hear,&quot; said Lucero. </p> 
<p>&quot;We just have to be confident the engineers know what they're 
doing,&quot; Noggle said.</p>

<p><b>Junior High principal search could end June 26</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>In a spate of personnel moves Tuesday the board of education for Archuleta 
School District 50 Joint accepted seven staff resignations, approved four 
hirings, and set in motion the selection of a new junior high school principal.
</p> 
<p>Friday is the deadline for applicants to file for the junior high post 
vacated with the retirement last month of Larry Lister.</p> 
<p>Interviews are expected to be conducted June 23 and 24 and a special 
district committee will then make a recommendation to the board.</p> 
<p>Committee members are board directors Clifford Lucero and Carol Feazel, 
principals Bill Esterbrook and Mark DeVoti, teachers Dan Janowsky and Maria 
Gallegos, and superintendent Duane Noggle.</p> 
<p>Late in the meeting, the board agreed to hold a special breakfast meeting 
at 7 a.m. June 26 to consider the committee recommendation.</p> 
<p>Whoever is selected, Noggle told the board, will need to get immediately 
into the system and being working out plans for the opening of the school year.
</p> 
<p>Other personnel actions Tuesday included:</p> 
<p>- accepting the resignation of Chantelle Kay as high school C Team 
volleyball coach and the hiring of Makaila Russler for that position and as 
combined intermediate and junior high PE and health teacher</p> 
<p>- accepting the resignation of Pauline Rivas as a food service employee </p>
<p>- accepting the resignation of Suzette Youngs as teacher for the School 
Within a School program</p> 
<p>- accepting the resignation of Eugene Spatz as a transportation mechanic</p>
<p>- accepting the resignation for retirement of Ramona Ruiz as high school 
lead cook</p> 
<p>- accepting the resignation of Doug Bowen as day treatment teacher. Bowen 
will be joining the staff of the alternative school in both teaching and 
management capacities </p> 
<p>- accepting the resignation of Randall Roberts as high school social 
studies teacher</p> 
<p>- approving the hiring of Don Danuser as junior high interpreter</p> 
<p>- approving the hiring of Melissa McDonald as a half-time high school 
secretary</p> 
<p>- approving the hiring of Judy Valdez as a half-time high school English 
and social studies teacher.</p> 
<p>Noggle told the board a candidate is ready to accept a half-time 
kindergarten teaching position and that will be ready for board approval next 
month.</p>

<p><b>Elementary school rehab plan covered in grant bid</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Ratification of a capital construction grant proposal Tuesday may have 
cleared the way for ongoing building improvements at Pagosa Springs Elementary 
School.</p> 
<p>Certain projects qualify, despite limited state funds, for assistance 
grants, said Superintendent Duane Noggle.</p> 
<p>Safety, fire, and student health are among those projects.</p> 
<p>The grant certification applies to heating, ventilation and electrical work 
at the school along with roof repair and continued asbestos removal.</p> 
<p>The school district has estimated total cost of all related projects at 
$750,253 and is asking for $300,000 from the state over a three year period.</p>
<p>The board action was taken after the motion was worded to indicate it is 
&quot;not committed to the full project if the funding is not forthcoming.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Still, Noggle said, much of the work is already planned or underway.</p> 
<p>Among things being done are removal of several walls and updating of 
electrical outlet placement. </p> 
<p>Noggle said the fire district has told the administration there are too 
many extension cords in use in the structure, and they need to be replaced with 
sufficient safety outlets to ensure availability of current where needed 
without fear of overload and resultant fire.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have enough capacity into the structure, just not enough outlets 
to avoid use of cords,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>He noted the building was completed in the 1960s when the open classroom 
concept was in vogue, and educational plant layout philosophy has changed 
greatly since then.</p> 
<p>In other action the board:</p> 
<p>- approved consolidated federal grant application for funding through Title 
1 to close the achievement gap (No Child Left Behind); Title 2 for proficiency 
development; Title 2B for technology improvement; Title 4 (drug free campus 
control) and Title 5 for development of innovative programs</p> 
<p>- received for first reading a proposed policy amendment on sick leave 
banking which has been approved by a staff committee and recommended for 
approval</p> 
<p>- received for first reading a proposed policy statement amendment for 
staff salary schedules which will expand on the ways in which tenure and 
experience can be compensated</p> 
<p>- at the request of Noggle, delayed approving a new social studies 
curriculum. Noggle said the overall plan is excellent &quot;but a few minor 
glitches need to be worked out.&quot;</p> 
<p>- heard director Jon Forrest's first report as delegate to the Board of 
Cooperative Services. He confirmed a new executive director, Kay Coleman, has 
been hired for the five-district cooperative, and &quot;she has new insights 
and ideas on changes needed. He said the cooperative budget is to be considered 
June 16 and there is a possibility accumulated funds could be returned on a 
percentage basis to help member districts meet current demands. &quot;It 
wouldn't be a huge sum,&quot; he said, &quot;but every penny counts in the 
current economic crisis for education.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Youngsters can fly with local pilots June 21 as part of Young Eagles 
program</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Taking kids to the clouds is the goal of a program arriving in Pagosa 
Springs June 21.</p> 
<p>Starting at 7 a.m. that morning, local pilots will offer free airplane 
rides to youth ages 8-17 through the Experimental Aircraft Association's Young 
Eagles Program. A pancake breakfast will be offered at the same time.</p> 
<p>Larry Bartlett, of Pagosa Springs, is organizing the event at Stevens Field.
</p> 
<p>&quot;My personal agenda is to try to generate some positive publicity for 
the airport and the community,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, the main goal is 
to introduce young people to airplanes.&quot; Bartlett is a member of the Four 
Corners Chapter of the EAA, located in Durango.</p> 
<p>The mission of the Young Eagles Program, started in 1992, is to 
&quot;provide a meaningful flight experience for one million young people by 
the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flight and the 50th 
anniversary of the Experimental Aircraft Association,&quot; milestones to be 
celebrated this year.</p> 
<p>The program has five main objectives: </p> 
<p>- to encourage young people to take an interest in aviation</p> 
<p>- to provide youth an opportunity to gain a new perspective on their 
community and their lives</p> 
<p>- to raise awareness of aviation career opportunities</p> 
<p>- to help young people understand the knowledge necessary to become a pilot 
</p> 
<p>- to respond to concerns that the nation's pool of pilots is shrinking.</p> 
<p>The idea is fairly simple: Local pilots, usually members of EAA, offer 
their time and their planes to show young people what it means to fly.</p> 
<p>Each demonstration flight takes place in a FAA-registered airplane flown by 
a licensed pilot.</p> 
<p>Bartlett is hoping to have between five and 10 planes available for the 
Young Eagle participants.</p> 
<p>Once the participants have filled out the permission form, they will be 
assigned a pilot and an airplane. Pilots will introduce their passengers to the 
different parts of an airplane, the forces of flight, safety and other basic 
pre-flight information and then take to the skies for a demonstration flight</p>
<p>Following the flight, each participant will be awarded a Young Eagles 
Certificate signed by their pilot and Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster 
than the speed of sound and Young Eagles honorary chairman.</p> 
<p>Young Eagles also have their names entered in the world's largest logbook 
on display at the EAA Air Adventure Museum in Oshkosh, Wis., are listed on the 
Young Eagles Web site logbook and receive information on scholarship programs 
administered by the EAA Aviation Foundation.</p> 
<p>According to the guidelines published for participants and parents, 
&quot;You will see the earth and sky in a new and exciting way. You will 
experience the wonderful freedom of flight that many people only dream about. 
Like an eagle, you will soar among the clouds and understand the many 
possibilities that flight - and life in general - have to offer. Many people 
remember this experience for the rest of their lives.&quot;</p> 
<p>A group of about seven women, employees of Wind Dancer Aviation and wives 
of local pilots, are organizing the pancake breakfast. It will also start at 7 
a.m. Four dollars will buy pancakes, sausages, bacon and eggs.</p> 
<p>Bartlett encouraged parents to pick up permission forms at Wind Dancer 
Aviation located at the Archuleta County Airport and have them filled out prior 
to June 21 if possible. However, permission forms will also be available at 
Stevens Field the day of the flights.</p>

<p></p> <b>Letters</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Issue clouded</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Congratulations. In your editorial of June 5 you did succeed in arriving at 
a significant truth: creation of comprehensive land use regulations that can be 
interpreted consistently and fairly is a crying need in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>However, most of your diatribe is an unjustified attack on the integrity 
and motivation of the citizens of Holiday Acres.</p> 
<p>You have succeeded in clouding the truth of a long struggle between local 
residents and profit-driven powers. One of the most dangerous aspects of this 
conflict has been a determined effort to deny the public the democratic right 
of commentary.</p> 
<p>The situation began when the planning commission reversed a recommendation 
of denial by the planning staff regarding the establishment of a gravel pit on 
the property in question, a decision later endorsed by the county commissioners 
sitting last fall.</p> 
<p>Things became much more heated when a decision was made that a request for 
the establishment of an asphalt plant to produce more than 73,000 tons of 
material could be considered under a Limited Impact Use application intended 
for uses &quot;relatively small in scale.&quot; This approach requires no 
notification to neighboring owners nor public hearing. A curtain of silence had 
effectively been drawn over those opposed to the project.</p> 
<p>At this point a Holiday Acres committee sought objective information from 
the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Research of the EPA. These 
data involve emissions recordings of various pollutants from asphalt plants, 
which have also met all governmental requirements. This information was 
distributed to several leaders of the community, including the managing editor 
of the Pagosa Springs SUN. The most typical reaction among these recipients was 
surprise and dismay - not only at the typical emissions of such a plant, but 
also that such an operation could be approved without a public hearing.</p> 
<p>Only after the successful applicant decided to appeal conditions of the 
approval was the public granted the opportunity for comment. One of those who 
spoke before the county commissioners in opposition to the asphalt plant was a 
representative of one of the county's oldest and most respected families. 
Although his remarks were strangely ignored by The SUN, he delivered a caustic 
commentary on the current procedures of county government. After he spoke, two 
commissioners finally took the refreshing step of a negative answer to the 
asphalt plant powers.</p> 
<p>I would like to thank Walter Green and Bob Nordman for their leadership. 
Only through their efforts to inform were the voices of like-minded associates 
heard in combating an attempt to silently install an industrial operation and 
its accompanying hazards.</p> 
<p>Bill Clark</p> 
<p><em>Editor's note:</em></p> 
<p><em>We agree that public comment is necessary in all disputes of this kind, 
at all stages of the process. We continue to submit that implementation of the 
Community Plan with comprehensive regulations - including, perhaps, some that 
require public hearings - could solve this and similar problems.</em></p> 
<p><em>We did not think Mr. Catchpole's remarks directly addressed the subject 
of the article, namely the proposed extension of operating hours at the asphalt 
plant. Please refer to Mr. Catchpole's letter to the editor in the May 22 SUN.
</em></p> 
<p><b>Permit problem</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Among those of us who are sometimes referred to as &quot;Commissioner 
Watchers,&quot; there is mounting concern that too little attention is being 
paid to local governmental procedures, especially concerning the issuance of 
permits to build potentially undesirable industrial complexes in the county.</p>
<p>Concern also exists over the adequacy of investigative reporting on such 
matters.</p> 
<p>A current beef is that the previous Board of County Commissioners quietly 
eliminated then-existing regulations which required two separate public 
hearings - one before the Planning Commission and another before the 
commissioners - before a permit could be issued to build an industrial facility 
in the county.</p> 
<p>Such is no longer the case. Currently, a contractor may build a potentially 
offensive facility after merely persuading the director of the county planning 
department (or his deputy) that such a facility meets certain standards. Gone 
are the formerly required public hearings and specific approval of the 
commissioners for the structure.</p> 
<p>A number of questions come to mind. Why have unelected officials been 
saddled with responsibilities not included in their job descriptions, and for 
which they are not compensated. Why do our county commissioners choose to 
delegate such decisions to unelected officials, and why do they believe public 
input on such matters is no longer of consequence? And why has The SUN not 
weighed in on these developments?</p> 
<p>Why, instead, did The SUN elect to criticize a distressed citizen who, 
while technically &quot;out of order&quot; had been totally frustrated in his 
efforts to obtain active support from several local officials (representing the 
county, the school board, both political parties and assorted civic 
organizations)?</p> 
<p>Where is the public outrage? Must we await the construction of a glue 
factory next to one of our churches located along the banks of the San Juan 
River before the sensibilities of our county commissioners - and the community 
at large - are aroused?</p> 
<p>If readers have views on this subject, please consider attending a county 
commissioner work sessions scheduled for 7 p.m. June 17 at which permitting 
procedures will be reviewed. I trust The SUN will provide adequate coverage of 
the meeting.</p> 
<p>Sincerely</p> 
<p>Gene Cortright</p> 
<p><em>Editor's note:</em></p> 
<p><em>The SUN has weighed in on the topic several times, urging creation of 
regulations pursuant to the Community Plan that reflect the wishes of the 
residents of the county concerning problems of this kind.</em></p> 
<p><em>To report on a lack of decorum at a public meeting is to give readers 
an indication of the emotional quality of the situation at hand. To criticize 
such behavior is to indicate that &quot;frustration&quot; is never an adequate 
excuse for a lack of civil behavior and respect.</em></p> 
<p><em>You may trust The SUN will cover the commissioner work session that has 
been scheduled (at least as of Tuesday) at 7 p.m. June 18.</em></p> 
<p><b>Report from Iraq</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I would like to thank whoever sent me the package with shaving razors and 
the edition of The Pagosa Springs SUN which featured all those from Pagosa who 
are serving in the U.S. military.</p> 
<p>I thought it was a great tribute to recognize those who serve. I think of 
the families of all those who sacrifice greatly.</p> 
<p>I know it has been hard on my wife Katherine (Bob and Shelley Frye's 
daughter). She is staying with her folks in Pagosa while all this is going on. 
She is doing well from the letters I get. Katherine, her parents, and my 
parents, have been going through a lot (like any family of a service member).
</p> 
<p>My unit's main mission is to keep the helicopters flying. We work out of a 
bombed-out hangar to kind of keep the sand out. My specific job is to fix 
helicopter engines. We get kept very busy. Our Division (101st Airborne - Air 
Assault ) is a division that moves troops, mainly by inserting them into battle 
by helicopter. So, it's pretty important to keep them flying.</p> 
<p>When we crossed the border into Iraq, we immediately saw how desperate the 
Iraqi people were for food. Mostly, children would stand by the side of the 
road hoping to get food or water. We threw them some of our own food - not 
because we were told to do so, but because to see another human being that 
skinny and that hungry made it the only right thing to do. Those of us who were 
in the truck knew the little bit of food we threw wouldn't make a big 
difference, but we had to do something.</p> 
<p>We had our first hot meal in about three weeks the other day. It wasn't 
anything big. But just the fact it was not an MRE made a big difference.</p> 
<p>We don't know how long we'll be here. It's easy to lose track of what day 
it is - almost helpful. It makes time seem to go by quicker. I try to keep my 
soldiers busy so time will go by more quickly. We all try to keep everyone's 
morale up. When one of us gets a care package, everyone gets a little something 
out of it.</p> 
<p>Thanks again for the package. I really appreciate it. I hope to see you all 
when I come home. Take care and stay safe.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Robert Gomez</p> 
<p><b>Frye's yard</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>After reading the Pagosa SUN May 29 issue story of the water board meeting 
in which Bob Frye, a director, states he would let his front yard die before 
the greens on the golf course, I ask, is Bob Frye's back yard the golf course?
</p> 
<p>At the same meeting, Karen Wessels, a board member, states &quot;domestic 
use would be a priority.&quot;</p> 
<p>A &quot;Yes&quot; for her!</p> 
<p>Let our tables flourish with homegrown veggies.</p> 
<p>Pam Morrow</p> 
<p><b>Health staffing</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I am sorry that my letter of last week was upsetting to some of our health 
care providers.</p> 
<p>I had a long, constructive visit with Dr. Piccaro of the Pagosa Family 
Medicine Clinic and I want to assure everyone that my comments were not 
intended to discredit his medical education and experience nor those of the 
other providers in that clinic.</p> 
<p>Dr. Piccaro came here less than two years ago and is up-to-date in his 
skills and his certification, which includes pediatrics and prenatal care. 
However, with our population growth, it is evident that there is and will be a 
need for additional family practice physicians with his credentials.</p> 
<p>In writing my comments, I simply stated that adding a recently educated 
family practice physician with training in the areas of infants and children 
and women's health would be a good addition to the Mary Fisher facility, as it 
appears this is the greatest need at this time.</p> 
<p>In our conversation, we both agreed that the other focus of the health 
services district board should be fully staffing the Urgent Care facility as 
this will greatly enhance health care for all of our providers, as rural 
physicians are compromised by the lack of local emergency-center services.</p> 
<p>I hope this letter clarifies any misconceptions folks may have regarding 
the services available at the Pagosa Family Medicine Clinic.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Patty Tillerson</p> 
<p>P.S. Please know that the purpose of my letters has been to generate public 
input as to what the public sees as priorities for our health services 
district. Suggestions in my letters are from personal contacts around the 
community, which I believe should be put before the public for consideration 
just as the Knoll-Blide concept, which was published in this newspaper. I asked 
for your input, not necessarily your agreement, via the Citizens Advisory 
Committee: e-mail at pshealth@pagosa.net.</p>

<p>What a lovely week at the Senior Center.</p> 
<p>We are already seeing a number of our summer seniors back again and 
everyone seems happy and busy.</p> 
<p>We had a lot of people show up for the &quot;Understanding Your 
Dreams&quot; talk. Barbara Conkey was here last month and had so many people 
attend that we scheduled her again.</p> 
<p>Now we are thinking of asking Barb to come back again; please call and let 
us know if you are interested in attending.</p> 
<p>We will be going to Creede June 21. If you are signed up to attend the play 
with us, please stop by to prepay for your ticket. Price is $14.45.</p> 
<p>Tomorrow is our free movie day for seniors. This month: &quot;Catch Me If 
You Can,&quot; starring Tom Hanks.</p> 
<p>This is the true story of a young con artist who acts as a pilot, a doctor 
and a lawyer, all without formal training. He stole millions of dollars in 
counterfeit checks before the age of 22. Will he get caught? Popcorn is only 25 
cents. Suggestions for next month's movie are always welcome.</p> 
<p>We will be having barbecue pork chops for lunch Friday to help celebrate 
Father's Day, along with a small treat. We hope to have a big crowd and hearty 
appetites in attendance.</p> 
<p>June 17 is our day to go to Sky Ute Casino in Ignacio. The trip is free to 
seniors and the sign-up list is in the dining room. Please sign up as soon as 
possible, this fun ride usually fills up fast.</p> 
<p>It's time for an ice cream social and sing-along. After lunch Wednesday, we 
will be serving up ice cream for only 50 cents. We will have the basic toppings 
here but encourage you to bring your own special additions - like brownies to 
put under the ice cream or mocha sprinkles on top. Be creative.</p> 
<p>If this is well-attended, we will have an ice cream social and sing-along 
every month this summer.</p> 
<p>We are still looking for a Medicare counselor for the Senior Health 
Insurance Assistance Program. Training is provided. Call Musetta at the senior 
center for more information.</p> 
<p>We want to say a special thanks to the First Baptist Church for donating a 
computer to us. It is very appreciated.</p> 
<p><b>Work-at-home schemes</b></p> 
<p>Be cautious about work-at-home advertisements, especially those that 
promise large profits with a minimum of work or make you pay up front for

<p>You should also be cautious about ads which say &quot;no experience 
necessary&quot; or &quot;easy money,&quot; or make exaggerated claims of 
potential earnings.</p> 
<p>Some advertisements use testimonials that cannot be confirmed or avoid 
putting details about the program in writing.</p> 
<p>Always remember this: If you are required to pay before you receive the

<p><b>Korean War memorial slated for San Luis Valley July 27</b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The San Luis Valley Korean War Commemorative Partnership Committee at 
Homelake and the Colorado State Veterans Center have scheduled a number of 
community events to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 
armistice that ceased hostilities on the Korean Peninsula during the Korean 
War, July 27, 1953.</p> 
<p><b>The Forgotten War</b> </p> 
<p>The Korean War is frequently referred to as &quot;The Forgotten War,&quot; 
perhaps because it was officially a &quot;police action,&quot; and not a 
declared war.</p> 
<p>The Korean War was not ended with a victory, but with a cease-fire that 
still exists.</p> 
<p>One only needs to see current events to know this peninsula is still a 
threat for peace in that region. </p> 
<p>Though it may be referred to as the Forgotten War, those who served in the 
armed forces in conflict in Korea will never forget it. It was just as much a 
war as any other, and our forces suffered many casualties.</p> 
<p>Fighting was intense and brutal, often in very freezing temperatures. Of 
those who were there, who can ever forget the Chosan Reservoir battle?</p> 
<p><b>Commemoration</b></p> 
<p>The Korean War commemoration weekend will run from July 24-27, and will 
coincide with the San Luis Valley Ski-Hi Stampede and the Fiesta de Santiago 
celebrations in Monte Vista and San Luis.</p> 
<p>A highlight of the event will be the presence and participation by six 
veterans from Colorado and New Mexico who were awarded the Congressional Medal 
Of Honor. </p> 
<p>The Congressional Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed forces 
who have acted &quot;above and beyond the call of duty,&quot; in acts of 
bravery and at substantial risk to their own lives.</p> 
<p>Very often, the medal is awarded posthumously. To bring six living Medal of 
Honor winners together at one time is an outstanding achievement of the 
committee.</p> 
<p><b>Medal recipients</b> </p> 
<p>I have been asked to assist the commemoration by escorting three of the 
Medal of Honor veterans as they appear throughout the festivities. I can assure 
you I will feel very humble in their presence.</p> 
<p>Kicking off the commemoration will be the San Luis Valley Ski Hi Stampede 
parade starting at 10 a.m. July 24.</p> 
<p>The parade will include a mass colors formation made up representatives 
from Colorado and New Mexico veterans' service organizations and the area's 
Native American Treaty Nations.</p> 
<p>A motorcade made up of vintage Korean War military vehicles and passenger 
vehicles will transport the Congressional Medal of Honor recipients, former 
prisoners of war, Republic of Korea dignitaries and honored guests.</p> 
<p><b>Colorful parades</b> </p> 
<p>The parade will be held both days, July 24 and 25 in Monte Vista. On July 
26 a similar parade will be held in San Luis.</p> 
<p>Also on the agenda is a reception held each afternoon after the Stampede 
until 2 p.m. at the VFW Post 3228, 371/2 Adams Street, Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>There will be an opening night concert and the annual Rotary Club barbecue 
on the evening of July 24. </p> 
<p><b>Memorial dedication</b> </p> 
<p>The contingent of dignitaries will participate in the Fiesta de Santiago 
parade in San Luis at 10 a.m. July 26. They will also be honored guests at the 
dedication of the Veteran's Memorial at the San Luis Museum courtyard.</p> 
<p>July 27 is the 50th anniversary of the armistice signing that ended 
hostilities in 1953.</p> 
<p>An ecumenical prayer/memorial service sponsored by the San Juan Community 
of Churches is scheduled for the Homelake Veteran's Cemetery beginning at 10 
a.m.</p> 
<p>Following the memorial service at approximately 12:30 p.m., all Korean War 
era veterans will be shuttled to the rodeo arena to be introduced en masse at 
the opening of the final day of the Ski Hi Stampede Rodeo.</p> 
<p><b>Fighter wing fly over</b></p> 
<p>Veterans will march into the rodeo arena behind the colors. The Colorado 
Air National Guard Fighter Wing will conduct a fly over.</p> 
<p>I urge our Archuleta County veterans and community citizens to attend these 
events and honor the veterans of the Korean War at these special events. For 
further information you can call Vickie Olson at the Homelake Colorado State 
Veterans Center, (719) 852-5118.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans benefits please call or stop by 
the Veterans Service Office located on the lower floor of the county 
courthouse. The office number is 264-2304, the fax number is 264-5949, and 
e-mail is afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open from 8 to 4, 
Monday through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p><b>Enhance a child's imagination at the summer reading program</b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Child's play is a serious pursuit. The emergence of imag-ination is a 
significant developmental milestone.</p> 
<p>Young children are realists who mainly consider their immediate experience. 
But sometime during their third year, they become capable of suspending reality 
in their play.</p> 
<p>They begin to treat objects not for what they are but what they could be. 
Toy blocks can be transformed into rocket ships, cars or anything the child's 
mind might envision.</p> 
<p>Imagination is the talent for seeing beyond reality to allow the mind to 
playfully connect ideas. This interplay of imagination with reality produces 
insight and discovery. </p> 
<p>Imagination complements rational thinking. Good judgment, originality, 
flexibility of thought and problem solving are all dependent on a healthy 
imagination.</p> 
<p>Reading to your children and encouraging them to indulge in 
&quot;recreational&quot; reading will help stimulate the imagination.</p> 
<p>Look for books that challenge their imagination. Create &quot;shared&quot; 
stories&quot; - make stories up together.</p> 
<p>Noted psychiatrist Bruno Bettelheim believes that children benefit from 
fairy tales because they can discover solutions for inner conflicts. Research 
shows that principles are more likely to be remembered if associated with an 
image, a fable or a parable than if presented as a fact or logical argument. 
</p> 
<p>Our summer reading program &quot;Chews to Read&quot; can help stimulate 
your family's quality time. Children of all ages may sign up this week for the 
program. It is all about fun. </p> 
<p><b>Good books</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Colorado's Great Gardens&quot; by Rob Proctor and Georgia Garnsey is 
a beautiful display of gardens as diverse as the state's various ecosystems.</p>
<p>We think of Colorado as the plains, the mountains and the plateaus. The 
book features 72 gardens from our dry Western Slope through the mountains to 
the eastern plains. Colorado gardeners must adjust to their own weather 
environments.</p> 
<p>Proctor lives in Denver. He has authored many gardening books and 
frequently appears on the Discovery Channel. Garnsey, also from Denver, helped 
to found the Children's Art Museum of Denver. She is the former editor of 
Colorado Homes &amp; Lifestyles magazine.</p> 
<p>The book will give you many ideas on planting for our climate and altitude. 
The pictures are blueprints for your garden.</p> 
<p>Diane Mott Davidson is a Colorado author living in Evergreen. She's become 
quite a popular mystery writer. Her heroine is Goldy Schulz, an excellent cook 
and caterer. Each of her books features recipes that the reader may try.</p> 
<p>&quot;Sticks and Scones,&quot; is called a &quot;delicious whodunit,&quot; 
by Bon Appetit magazine. Goldy is busy cooking authentic Elizabethan fare in a 
real castle that was brought over from England and reassembled stone by stone 
in Aspen Meadow.</p> 
<p>&quot;She's dishing up another dangerously tasty treat of murder and 
mystery&#138;&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ready, set, create</b> </p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>School may by out for summer, but for art students, the learning has just 
begun.</p> 
<p>Over the next three weeks, about 30 students entering grades one through 
nine will be gathering at the elementary school for Summer Arts Camp - a camp 
designed specifically for &quot;children who love art, who can't get enough of 
it, and who want to learn more about art in a creative, supportive 
setting.&quot;</p> 
<p>Participants spend three hours a day at the camp and get to choose two of 
six classes to take - Clay'n Around, For Everything Your Art Desires, Hooked on 
Drawing, Fun with Painting, Kids Rule Art Class and Toy Making and Awesome 
Crafts.</p> 
<p>When they're through, instructor Lisa Brown said, each student will require 
a box to move the artwork home. &quot;We'll be completing a project every 
couple of days. The amount of work they can do in three weeks is amazing.&quot;
</p> 
<p>To squeeze it all in, young artists tackled their first projects just 
minutes into camp. Instructor Tessie Garcia, Pagosa's elementary school art 
teacher during the rest of the year, got her class started on clay whistles. 
Before the week was over, she also planned to have the class create 
one-of-a-kind masks and shakers. Before camp ends June 27, her students will 
have the opportunity to try air-dry clays, water-setting clays and oven-baked 
clays as well as to glaze and paint their own pottery.</p> 
<p>In Lisa Brown's Kids Rule class, T-shirt design was the name of the game, 
but in a new twist, the students got to decide what project they would use to 
decorate their shirts. At one table, students were working on patterns for 
batik, a resist process. At another table, participants were twisting their 
shirts into tied snake-shapes. Later, the tied, twisted shapes would be dyed.
</p> 
<p>Susan Hagan's students were practicing their shapes and shadows skills by 
drawing animals using pictures in books and some models as their inspiration.
</p> 
<p>It was clear, the creative juices were flowing.</p> 
<p>&quot;See, the starfish thinks the momma turtle is a rock,&quot; one 
student said showing off her drawing to Brown. </p> 
<p>&quot;They teach me more than I teach them,&quot; Brown, who has a 
bachelor's degree in art education, said a little later. &quot;I just present a 
technique, perhaps give some examples and they just role with it. A lot of 
times they come up with different ways of doing things that I would have never 
thought of. They keep us fresh.&quot;</p> 
<p>Brown also teaches after-school art classes at the Archuleta County 
Education Center. Besides trying to come up with new projects to show the 
students every year, she said, the instructors also try to incorporate 
recyclables to teach a lesson beyond creativity. This year that will include 
making rain sticks out of PVC pipe.</p> 
<p>In Garcia's classroom, lumps of clay were quickly being rounded and 
hollowed into turtles, cats and other shapes. Add a couple carefully placed 
holes, and a whistle is made.</p> 
<p>Rachel Koepp, headed into seventh grade, was working hard to decide what 
kind of a whistle she planned to shape this summer. Last year it was a cat.</p> 
<p>&quot;I really like art, and I like to make things, so I decided to come 
back,&quot; she said. Although she generally likes drawing, lately clay has 
caught her eye.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's just cool,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>Kara Hollenbeck, who will be a sixth-grader next year, said she heard about 
the camp and thought it would be a good activity to try. With a little 
assistance from the instructor, her first day was going well.</p> 
<p>&quot;I've liked clay for a couple years,&quot; she said before jumping up 
to head off for a short recess and the next project.</p> 
<p>After all, that was just the first session of classes.</p> 
<p>After the break, round two of art camp began. Some headed for Everything 
Your Art Desires - Garcia's potpourri of projects to include Mexican Tin 
Punching, frames and mirrors, papermaking, jewelry and T-shirts.</p> 
<p>&quot;My favorite project last year was probably tin punching,&quot; Koepp 
said.</p> 
<p>Hagan's students delved into painting to discover the basics of 
long-distance perspective, shadowing and rendering shapes. Over in Brown's 
classroom, students became toy makers exploring the ins and outs of 22 
different kinds of toys. The first day, she planned to show them a gravity 
screw. As the weeks went on, they would also learn to make balancing toys, 
bubble wands and rain sticks just to name a few.</p> 
<p>&quot;I always say this is the highlight of the summer because I get paid 
to play,&quot; Brown said. She encourages parents to come volunteer on some of 
the bigger projects.</p> 
<p>&quot;We always need volunteers,&quot; she said, &quot;even if they can 
only come for the day. They get to make stuff on the side, too.&quot; Brown has 
been teaching at the art camp for seven summers. Garcia's been with the program 
since the inception a decade ago. &quot;No,&quot; she said, burnout is not a 
factor.</p> 
<p>&quot;I grew up in Pagosa Springs,&quot; said Garcia. &quot;When I was a 
little girl there was nothing in Pagosa for kids to do. I thought, when I grow 
up, I'm going to do something for the community and this is what I've chosen to 
do to give kids something to do in the summertime.&quot; The kids actually make 
it easy to come back year after year.</p> 
<p>&quot;The looks on their faces, their creativity. It's just amazing,&quot; 
she said.</p> 
<p>The camp is made possible through the assistance of the Pagosa Springs Arts 
Council, the Archuleta County School District, Pagosa Rotary Club, Archuleta 
County Recycling Committee and Hogue's Glass. Cost is $150 per student, but 
scholarships are available.</p> 
<p>Camp started June 9 and will run through June 27. For more information, 
call Garcia at 731-9244.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Pagosa's Past</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Average citizens with more than average courage cleared the land</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Frontier Pagosa Country would have been a veritable dreamland for any 
western movie scriptwriter. Pick a theme, a story line. All of the elements 
were present.</p> 
<p>First choose a time. Any year or group of years between 1860 and 1885 would 
work.</p> 
<p>I'd loosely include an area stretching from Abiquiu or maybe Santa Fe up 
the Chama River and across the Continental Divide into the San Juan Basin and 
up to Silverton. I'd include the entire Four Corners area and maybe go over 
into the San Luis Valley as far as Fort Garland. The story line might require a 
tighter definition of area, but that could be worked out.</p> 
<p>The scriptwriter couldn't go much before 1860 without changing the story 
line. Before 1860, there were no non-Indians living permanently in the area.</p>
<p>By 1885, the place was basically tamed. A writer might consider a date 
later than 1885 if the focus is to be big logging. In that case, the time frame 
should shift to include the years from about 1890 to maybe 1915.</p> 
<p>No one could ask for a better ethnic mix. Consider the year 1878 when Fort 
Lewis sprang up in Pagosa Springs. Just south of the border and over in the San 
Luis Valley were the New Mexico Hispanics, already on this Rocky Mountain 
frontier for several hundred years, hardy, self sufficient, independent folks.
</p> 
<p>In northwestern New Mexico, the Navajo remained very much a presence. Also 
in northern New Mexico and throughout Colorado various bands of Utes still 
roamed and hunted, resenting white intruders and looking for a home. Scattered 
throughout northern New Mexico bands of Jicarilla Apaches tried to make a 
living in a world no longer suited to their life style. </p> 
<p>Moving through Pagosa Country hordes of prospectors traveled in bands large 
or small, headed for the gold mines in the higher mountains. Merchants, farmers 
and ranchers traveling mostly in small family groups, all of their worldly 
possessions crammed into wagons drawn by horses, oxen, or mules, creaked and 
rattled down the dirt highways.</p> 
<p>In the years before fences, English cattle barons sponsored huge herds of 
cattle throughout the Four Corners region. Some of these cattle were longhorns 
driven up from Texas. Others were the English breeds, driven in from the Denver 
area, a sort of rebound effect that started with cattle prodded along the 
Oregon Trail to Oregon during the 1840s, then later into the Rocky Mountains to 
feed the 1859 gold rush.</p> 
<p>The ranches stretched across the land, cattle grazed by the hundreds of 
thousands, and the cattle barons were kings of all they surveyed.</p> 
<p>Of course there were sheep, mostly from New Mexico.</p> 
<p>Around the sprouting communities loggers and lumber mills made lumber as 
fast as they could. And watching over all were cavalry and infantry troops.</p> 
<p>And so the stage was volatile and ripe for conflict. Early settlers talk of 
visits from roaming bands of Indians. Among those settlers were the Pargins who 
carved out a home on Beaver Creek on the historic road between Pagosa Springs 
and Durango.</p> 
<p>Consider the stage stop on the Piedra River about a mile south of the 
present bridge. Streams of men, women and children traveled that route, all 
looking for a home. The innkeepers eyed a parade of humanity: 
down-on-their-luck prospectors carrying everything they owned in sacks on their 
backs; bands of mounted, buckskin-clad Ute braves; families - dad, mom, the 
baby and maybe grandma or grandpa - plodding along behind animal powered 
wagons; and not rarely single men or maybe even groups of men, hard-eyed, rough 
talking and well armed.</p> 
<p>There were men wanted for crimes in other areas, men who holstered their 
consciences on their hips. The only law, the family rifle, hung over the 
fireplace. There had to be nights when the innkeeper didn't sleep, struggled 
through the darkness to keep awake, gun resting on his lap, hoping that boarder 
who slept with his boots on meant no harm.</p> 
<p>And what happened at Piedra happened in Chromo and throughout Pagosa 
Country.</p> 
<p>Then there were the army troops, couriers carrying messages back and forth 
between Fort Lewis and outposts on the Animas, mail carriers, and once, General 
Sheridan riding in an Army ambulance, out inspecting his frontier troops.</p> 
<p>Settlers still hunted for the family table. Grizzly bears and wolves 
frequented the back country. And, of course, there was no electricity, no 
telephone, no central water.</p> 
<p>A shadow of pending violence hung over the land. Outlaws held up stage 
coaches and menaced lonely travelers. Rival cattle companies feuded and took 
turns shooting each other down. Men argued over where to locate a homestead and 
where roads should be placed and over who got the water. Prospectors bickered 
over gold claims. Indians complained and threatened the encroaching 
civilization.</p> 
<p>Most of the settlers were peaceable, law abiding citizens just looking for 
a fresh start on their own land with enough room around them to stretch their 
eyes, test their muscles and raise their families.</p> 
<p>These were the people who tamed Pagosa Country, these average citizens with 
more than average courage who cleared the land, braved the elements, went to 
church, taught their children the differences right and wrong.</p> 
<p>Several movies have been filmed in Pagosa Country in the past. They were 
pretty much generic westerns that could have been filmed anywhere.</p> 
<p>The building blocks are still here for much more.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Strong season ahead</b> </p> 
<p>There are indications Pagosa Country could be headed into a normal, 
prosperous summer season. Traffic on U.S. 160 and U.S. 84 is picking up, with 
non-Colorado license plates on many of the vehicles heading to the area. There 
are RVs parked at local stops; the number of timeshare owners and condo renters 
in the area is increasing and they are visible in the local grocery stores, at 
our gas stations, on the golf course.</p> 
<p>If the signs are accurate, our retailers should experience a bump up in 
business.</p> 
<p>In a community where a prosperous tourism industry is a fundamental pillar 
of the economy, the more visitors we get this summer, and the happier they are, 
the better.</p> 
<p>This is especially true after last summer, when we were hit by a triple 
whammy - a shaky national economy, fire and drought.</p> 
<p>The terrible trio put the hurt on us, after a run of outstanding years when 
it seemed our economy was bulletproof, where revenue growth seemed certain. 
Then came 9/11 and all that followed - the tech market crash and the overall 
slump in the market. The situation dampened enthusiasm, the willingness of many 
people to travel and spend their money.</p> 
<p>Then, we experienced severe drought, regional in nature. National news 
sources dispensed stories and images about the lack of water throughout the 
Southwest. Here, we went on a serious restriction program, limiting 
non-essential use of water; much that was verdant a year before turned quickly 
to brown.</p> 
<p>Then, the final blow: the Missionary Ridge Fire. The blaze was near Pagosa 
Country and, again, news was spread to the far corners of the U.S. Many 
travelers called off plans to visit us as images of forests in flame danced on 
their television screens.</p> 
<p>Now, visitors seem to be in the mood to return, to enjoy this beautiful 
part of the world. With this pleasant prospect, there are things we can do to 
help things along. </p> 
<p>First, we can welcome people who find Pagosa Country a desirable place to 
spend their vacations. The extra crowding is at times an irritant to 
old-timers, but the discomfort should be balanced by a recognition of the value 
of the tourism industry. Sales tax revenues count big in the plans of town and 
county government; without them, projects and amenities that benefit the 
resident population are threatened.</p> 
<p>Second, we need to take care of our environment to ensure the tourist 
season continues successfully. Two problems that haunted the 2002 season are, 
potentially, still with us: drought and fire.</p> 
<p>We had some snow this year and we've benefited from the runoff. We've had 
some rain. The lakes and reservoirs seem healthier than last year. They are, 
but we are nowhere near the break-even point on water. A sustained dry spell, 
and we are back in the same situation we were last summer. With luck, this will 
not happen, but the best way to deal with the possibility is to continue to 
conserve water - to be mindful of how we use this most precious resource.</p> 
<p>We must also guard against fire. The recent Trail Creek fire shows our 
forests are still perilously dry. Quick and effective response by forest 
service fire crews contained the blaze but big fuels in the forest remain 
kiln-lumber dry. The forest service elevated fire danger in the forests to high 
and we need to exercise care with fire in residential and recreational 
settings. We should caution our visitors to do the same.</p> 
<p>We're into the swing of the summer season. It has the potential to be a 
fine one. Let's do what we can to make sure we prosper and we are safe.</p>

<p><b>Corked keyboard asks equal time</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p>My corked keyboard is all worked up wondering why Sammy should get all that 
free publicity?</p> 
<p>It demands to be heard and I've given permission for it to create this 
week's column, to wit:</p> 
<p>Why should an American icon of Dominican descent be chastised for his use 
of a baseball bat filled with foreign materials?</p> 
<p>After all, Mr. Sosa, the pride of Wrigley Field's right field bleacher 
bums, confessed. He said it was just a mistake on his part, that he picked the 
wrong bat out of the supply he keeps on hand.</p> 
<p>He admitted it was used for hitting demonstrations and for home run 
competitions. He did not explain why he needs such a bat.</p> 
<p>That, in itself, is enough to tarnish the image he's engendered with 
children in Chicago, the Dominican Republic and around the world in his 
ballyhooed home run derby with Mark McGuire and his quest for Hall of Fame 
nomination when his career is done.</p> 
<p>This keyboard has produced reams of copy stuffed with superlatives, 
verbiage, homophones, and praises galore.</p> 
<p>No one has cited it as an illegal assist to a struggling newsman.</p> 
<p>No one has called for an investigation of all its myriad electronic 
programs and integral links with the outside world through e-mail and Internet.
</p> 
<p>Hey, keyboards of America, arise! </p> 
<p>You deserve as much publicity as Sosa and you only have to produce words, 
not round-trippers.</p> 
<p>The whole thing would be ridiculous if not so much importance were placed 
on the talents of the &quot;supreme&quot; athletes today.</p> 
<p>The same should be true of us - the computer keyboards. We are called on to 
take all the bumbling finger strokes applied, all the abuse when the program 
fails, and never, ever, get any of the praise heaped on journalists for their 
verbosity and poetic brilliance.</p> 
<p>When, after all, is the last time you saw a keyboard held up for all the 
world to cheer - or ridicule because our fonts were corked?</p> 
<p>And it isn't a simple thing to cork a keyboard, obviously not as simple as 
corking a bat. After all, you have to get the original manufacturer to 
cooperate. You need a special kind of silica that will stand up to the abuse of 
bumbling key strikers, and a static arrester which will screen out all the 
vulgarity it might be subjected to if it fails to perform magic and turn 
collected wandering thought into epics of controlled wisdom.</p> 
<p>Sosa's corked bat episode is not the first of its kind in professional 
baseball, nor, this keyboard suspects, will it be the last.</p> 
<p>Some other &quot;supreme&quot; athlete will believe he or she can get away 
with it, never get caught, and go on living the &quot;people's choice&quot; 
lifestyle.</p> 
<p>Well, it's high time that keyboards, PDAs, palm pilots and all those other 
communications tools which take abuse from our users unite.</p> 
<p>We must demand our day in the headlines. We want equal time with the 
abusers of childhood dreams and worship of enamored fans.</p> 
<p>Keyboards, unite!</p>

<p>The county has started the building of a county jail on the county lots 
opposite the Methodist parsonage on Lewis Street. It will be of concrete and 
therefore fireproof. The cells in the old jail will be used. Within the next 
few years Archuleta County will probably build a new court house and jail and 
the jail now being built will be purchased by the town for a calaboose if 
present plans hold good.</p> 
<p>Jim Carlin has decided to make his first mill setting on the old Rudy 
Flaugh ranch, three miles southeast of town.</p> 
<p>Bud Kleckner, the Piedra forest ranger, recently killed a big silver tip 
bear - weighed 1,000 pounds according to Charlie Mack.</p>

<p>A Willys-Knight sedan belonging to a tourist of Kansas, lies at the bottom 
of a canyon near the top of Wolf Creek Pass, owing to the fact that the driver 
failed to put on his emergency brake. The family went up Saturday to view the 
scenery. The party alighted from the car to enjoy the panorama. The wife at 
first left her baby in the car and after going a short distance decided to go 
back for it. Upon their return to the spot, the automobile had somersaulted 
down the canyon and was demolished.</p> 
<p>Miguel Chavez, who has held the position of engine watchman at the local 
roundhouse for many years has resigned, and will be succeeded by Homer 
McKinley, who for the past two years has been pumpman at Pagosa Junction.</p>

<p>The American Legion is sponsoring another of the popular Donkey Ball Games 
at the Red Ryder Round-Up grounds Monday. The proceeds of the game are to go to 
the American Legion building program for the construction of the new addition 
to the Legion Hall.</p> 
<p>The Town Board met last weekend to consider the revised report of their 
engineers on a proposed water system. They discussed the plan and details that 
were different from the original proposal. Instead of gravity power for the 
system, it would discard the present water wheel and use diesel power for 
pumping. It would also have a standby system. It would provide adequate water 
to all consumers, serve every residence in town and pay for itself in not more 
than twenty to twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Drilling has started on a 2,000 foot deep test well in back of the court 
house. The well is being drilled to explore for sources of geothermal energy 
and will go the entire depth unless some exceptionally hot water is encountered 
before that depth. The hottest water in the first 100 feet was 140 degrees.</p> 
<p>Modesto Montoya, town water commissioner, said this week that the annual 
misunderstanding about water rates for sprinkling and irrigation is here. Town 
ordinances provide that water rates include a charge per front foot for 
sprinkling and watering of lawns and gardens. However, the charge is levied 
only during the summer months rather than being spread over the entire year.</p>
