Water</strong> &gt; Distilled Water VS Mineral, Carbon Filtered and Reverse 
Osmosis Water 
<p>Distilled water is the healthiest water that you can drink. It does not 
cause mineral loss but in fact takes out harmful toxins from the body.</p> 
<h1>Distilled Water VS Mineral, Carbon Filtered and Reverse Osmosis Water</h1> 
<p> Ron Kennedy, M.D. </p> 
<p> There is circulating a point of view about distilled water, undoubtedly 
promulgated by producers and sellers of mineral water. This point of view is 
that water should be mineralized in order to have health benefits and that 
distilled water somehow leaches out minerals from the body. </p> 
<p> To understand the truth about this matter one must know a little about 
mineral chemistry in living systems. In order for a mineral to be of any use to 
the body it must be presented in a form in which it can be used. That form 
involves an association with an organic (carbon based) molecule. Carbon based 
molecules are to be found in living systems, and are not found in the ground 
which is where mineral water comes from. Water from the ground comes with 
minerals alright, but these minerals are in salt form. When salt is presented 
to the body (with rare exceptions such as sodium chloride) it must be either 
stored or excreted. A good example is CaCO3 (calcium carbonate). Carbonate is 
not a sufficiently complex organic molecule and therefore cannot properly 
contribute its calcium to living systems. The calcium comes out instead in 
ionic form (with a positive charge) and precipitates by forming other salts. 
Common locations for precipitation of calcium are the lens of the eye 
(cataracts), the kidneys (kidney stones) and the walls of arteries 
(arteriosclerosis). Unbound minerals must be excreted, which is extra work for 
the kidneys) or stored. This makes dust of the argument that healthy water is 
mineralized, and dust is of course the source of minerals in mineral water. </p>
<p> Incidentally, CaCO3 comes from lime stone and comprises the bulk of most 
calcium supplements, including that in &ldquo;calcium enriched orange 
juice.&rdquo; If you want cataracts, kidney stones, and arteriosclerosis, be 
sure to eat and drink &ldquo;calcium enriched&rdquo; foods. </p> 
<p> Now as to the argument that distilled water leaches out minerals. This is 
true, and this is exactly what we want it to do. The minerals it leaches out 
are of the unusable, ionic form and we want these to leave the body rather than 
be deposited and cause disease. Distilled water does not leach out significant 
amounts of biologically available minerals because these are quickly taken up 
by the body on an as needed basis. If they are present in excess then they are 
filtered through the kidneys and this is exactly what needs to happen with all 
things which are in excess in the circulation. Distilled water cleanses the 
body through promoting healthy kidney function. </p> 
<p> Finally, if mineral water is not a good source of biologically available 
minerals, then what is? Think about it. Minerals are present in the ground and 
must be biologically bound in order to be used by the body. Where would that 
come from? Plants, or course! Your mineral source should be plants not water. 
The purpose of water is to cleanse the body. To do the best job of that, it 
must be free of everything else. Only distilled water fits that bill. </p> 
<p> As to carbon filtered and reverse osmosis water, these are better 
solutions than tap water or mineral water, however they still fall far short of 
the standard set by distilled water. </p> 
<p> Nature knows best and nature supplies distilled water in the form of rain. 
However, rain water is no longer pure due to atmospheric pollution. The only 
remaining option is for us to distill our own water. </p> 
<p> If you would like to read more I recommend two books: <em>The Truth About 
Water</em> and <em>Your Body&rsquo;s many Cries For Water</em>. </p>
