<h2>Plastics refresher: What number is safe again?</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 3, 5 and 7, right? Or is it 4, 6 and 7?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a 7?&rdquo; When safe plastics came up at a get-together 
at my house last week, and none of could remember exactly what we were trying 
to avoid, I realized it was time for a refresher. I&rsquo;ve done a little 
research on your behalf to clarify<strong>which are safe plastics and which are 
best avoided.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>No. 1 plastic</strong> is PET, or polyethylene terephthalate. 
Commonly used in beverage bottles, PET is generally considered safe, although 
some warn not to reuse it repeatedly because it may degrade over time.<strong>
Eco alternative:</strong> Stainless-steel or glass bottles.</p> 
<p><strong>No. 2 plastic</strong> is HDPE, or high-density polyethylene. This 
plastic is also considered safe; you&rsquo;ll find the No. 2 symbol on yogurt 
containers, juice jugs and in plastic bags such as those used by grocery stores 
and inside cereal boxes.</p> 
<p><strong>No. 3 plastic </strong>is PVC, or polyvinyl chloride. Found in food 
packaging and used in some cling wraps, there are enough studies showing 
concerns about PVC that it&rsquo;s best avoided. Better safe than sorry, right?
<strong>Eco alternative:</strong> Stainless-steel or glass food containers, or 
containers made with No. 1 or No. 2 plastic.</p> 
<p><strong>No. 4 plastic</strong> is LDPE, or low-density polyethylene. This 
flexible plastic is used to make plastic bags and wraps, among other 
applications. While considered safe, who wants to see all those bags in the 
landfill?<strong> Eco alternative:</strong> Reuseable bags for produce and all 
your shopping needs. I&rsquo;m sure Eco Logic readers are all over this one!</p>
<p><strong>No. 5 plastic</strong> is PP, or polypropylene. You&rsquo;ll see it 
in reuseable food containers (not the lids, though), some condiment bottles, 
and it&rsquo;s used to make fleece jackets, that thin, clear film that envelops 
stationery, and other uses. While generally considered safe, not every 
municipality has recycling facilities for polypropylene.</p> 
<p><strong>No. 6 plastic</strong> is PS, or polystyrene. Commonly used in foam 
takeout, egg, hot drink and other containers, as well as for meat trays and 
foam packing materials, polystyrenewill release styrene monomer, particularly 
when your food is hot and contains fat. Polystyrene is unrecyclable in many 
areas.<strong> Eco alternative:</strong> Bring your own takeout food container 
or, if you ordered something dry like a pizza, quesadilla or sandwich, ask the 
server to put your leftovers in tinfoil. Buy your meat from a butcher who uses 
butcher paper.</p> 
<p><strong>No. 7 plastic</strong> can be a few things, but is most often 
polycarbonate, used to make hard, transparent plastic products, and which may 
contain BPA, or bisphenol-A. Like polystyrene,BPA will release from 
polycarbonate more quickly when heated. <strong> Eco alternative:</strong> Once 
again, stainless-steel or glass bottles are great choices.</p> 
<p><strong>Are you avoiding certain plastics?</strong></p> <b>&nbsp;</b>  Tags:

<h2>Guest post: Hawks wing in for the season</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m away for a few days, but writer Catherine Labelle has a story she 
would like to share with you.</p> 
<p>Take it away Catherine!</p> 
<p>*</p> 
<p>An eerie silence creeps into my backyard.&nbsp; No more calls from the 
cardinals, and the squirrels have stopped leaping from tree to tree.&nbsp; Then 
I hear it, an ear piercing screech as a shadow moves along the pages of my 
book.&nbsp; The hawks are back!</p> 
<p>Every summer a pair of <strong>red-tailed hawks</strong> descend upon my 
neighbourhood. The graceful raptors swoop and soar in the sky, seemingly 
performing for their many admirers.&nbsp;With the hawks&rsquo; arrival, my 
neighbours fall into a familiar routine &ndash; a Jack Russel a few doors down 
is no longer tied outside, and cats are kept indoors.&nbsp;Personally, I run 
around with my camera for days trying to catch a snapshot of these magnificent 
creatures. Last year I narrowly missed one that was perched in full view on a 
nearby washing pole.</p> 
<p>What attracts these birds of prey to my little corner of the world is a 
bank of 100-foot trees that pass along the edge of my yard.&nbsp; The hawks 
rely on these trees and others like them for shelter and a base from which to 
hunt.&nbsp; It is not unusual to spot one of the hawks perched on a branch 
scouring the ground below for squirrels, mice and snakes.</p> 
<p>Considering I live in the largest city in Canada, I am extremely fortunate 
to have such impressive towering giants so close.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s face it, 
cities, particularly large ones, are not generally kind to trees. Each year 
more and more mature trees in my neighbourhood disappear.&nbsp; In the spring 
we lost a 125-year-old tree a few streets over.&nbsp; Replacements, what few 
there are, are saplings that will take decades to grow to a decent size.&nbsp; 
That is if they survive the city&rsquo;s smog, changing climate and never 
ending development.&nbsp;With urban trees facing such challenges, it is a 
wonder whether we will be seeing hawks in the city for much longer.</p> 
<p>Perhaps all is not lost.&nbsp; Organizations like <strong>LEAF</strong>, a 
not-for-profit, are working to restore more tree-cover in urban centres.&nbsp; 
Trees Ontario and Ontario&rsquo;s Ministry of Natural Resources have joined 
together in an ambitious greening program.&nbsp;Their goal: plant<strong>50 
million trees</strong> in southern Ontario within 10 years.</p> 
<p>My hope is next summer, the tranquility in my backyard will again be 
broken.&nbsp; That once again I will hear the screech and know the hawks have 
made it back.</p>

<h2>Delicious ways to live lighter on the Earth</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Looking at my grocery list the other day,<strong> I realize that I often 
buy the same things.</strong>Whether in my organic food delivery box, at the 
store or at the farmer&rsquo;s market, I seem to like Boston lettuce, button 
mushrooms, zucchini, asparagus, grape tomatoes and broccoli, maybe some fennel. 
I grill, stir-fry and roast these things, put them in salads, saute them for 
pastas, drop them in risotto. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love these tasty 
veggies. But I recently learned a fact that made it clear I&rsquo;d be doing 
the planet a favour if I expanded my shopping list.</p> 
<p> According to The Complete Idiot&rsquo;s Guide to Self-Sufficient Living, 
&ldquo;Throughout history, nearly 10,000 different plants have provided food 
for humans.<strong>Today, only about 150 species are used anywhere in the world.
</strong> More than 70 percent of our food comes from just 12 of these.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p><strong>Wow. I can see how not only eating locally, but trying new things 
would benefit local producers &mdash; and the environment.</strong> According to
this paper from the University of California, &ldquo;Properly managed, 
diversity can also buffer a farm in a biological sense. For example, in annual 
cropping systems, crop rotation can be used to suppress weeds, pathogens and 
insect pests.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So the next time I&rsquo;m at the farmer&rsquo;s market (that should be 
tomorrow) I&rsquo;ll pick something new, and let you know what it was and how I 
prepared it as part of a tasty meal.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, <strong>here are a few delicious recipes from Homemakers
</strong> that include veggies that, I&rsquo;m betting, are outside of that top 
12 list!</p> 
<p><strong>Grilled Quail.</strong> Yes, diversity counts in the butcher shop 
as well!</p> 
<p><strong>Beet and Jerusalem Artichoke Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing. 
</strong> Yes, Jerusalem Artichokes can be grown locally!</p> 
<p><strong>Braised Baby Bok Choy with Lemon and Lemon Grass</strong> This 
sounds so tasty, I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding some fresh bok choy!</p> 
<p><strong>Cilantro and Mint Raita.</strong> This is a tasty dip, and feels 
cool on hot days.</p> 
<p><strong>Green Superstar Soup</strong>. This features kale, collard greens 
and spinach. Healthfully delicious!</p> 
<p><strong>What are your favourite unconventional summer foods, and how do you 
prepare them?<br>

<h2>And the first electric car to be sold in Canada is...</h2> 
<p>Charge 'er up!</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a race to the production line, but unless a shipload of Nissan 
Leafs (Leaves?) or Tesla S show up within the next couple of months, the first 
fully electric car to be available at Canadian dealers, legal on Canadian roads 
will be the smart. Already sold in Europe, 1,500 smart fortwo electric drive 
cars will be available for long-term lease in North America starting this fall, 
rumoured to cost approx. $600 per month. This second generation of smart EVs 
(electric vehicles) will have a range of 135 kilometres and a home-charging 
system, the smart can handle many Canadians&rsquo; daily needs. By 2012, the 
car will be available in 40 countries.</p> 
<p>Provincial governments are offering rebates for buying or leasing EVs; 
Ontario is offering between $5,000 and $8,000. They plan to offer recharging 
stations at some commuter hubs and allow EV drivers into HOV lanes, even if 
there&rsquo;s only one person in the car.Alberta is offering $3,000 rebates for 
hybrid taxis. Manitoba is actually testing a hybrid vehicle made in the 
province, hoping for a home-grown alternative vehicle, but no word yet on 
rebates for individuals.</p> 
<p><strong>Will the electric car wipe the gasser off the map?</strong> Of 
course not. Not right away. But why do arguments against the electric car 
always assume it&rsquo;s eat or be eaten? Just like banking, where we once had 
just tellers, then we had tellers and phone banking, then we added ATMs, then 
we added internet banking, then mobile banking, adding electric cars simply 
means new options for the marketplace. As the cost of fuel rises, and the scale 
of electric car production increases, no doubt EVs will seem increasingly 
attractive. Not because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, but because 
it&rsquo;s convenient. (Think about it: You could &ldquo;fill up&rdquo; 
overnight at home, when power rates are at their cheapest, rather than stopping 
by a station.)</p> 
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m just looking forward to an affordable zero-emission choice.

<h2>Until tomorrow, here's a revealing video</h2> 
<p>Hi everybody! I&rsquo;m swamped finalizing the September issue of Homemakers
 magazine. The rest of the team and I are working hard to make sure every t is 
crossed! So until tomorrow, here&rsquo;s an interesting video I found showing a 
reporter gathering water samples at various public beaches in Alabama &ndash; 
beaches that are being enjoyed by lots of people, including little kids &ndash; 
in order to determine the oil levels at each beach. The results? Well, watch 
for yourself.</p> <b>&nbsp;</b>  Tags: BP oil spill <br>

<h2>Contest: Share your garbage-reduction tip!</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s share our garbage-reduction tips.</strong> I have a 
great prize in store for your winning idea!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll share mine first, to get you started. </p> 
<p>In the past I&rsquo;ve had trouble keeping some kinds of packages out of 
the garbage because of the stuff left in them. But these days I&rsquo;m trying 
to use my green bin to the fullest, and that means getting icky spoiled food 
out of the bottom of containers so I can send the spoiled food for composting 
and the container it was in to be recycled.</p> 
<p>During Toronto&rsquo;s garbage strike last year, I started freezing my 
green bin material; a big part of my freezer was devoted to waste by the time 
the strike was over. I learned something: when you don&rsquo;t put smelly stuff 
in your green bin &ndash; particularly in summer &ndash;<strong>raccoons
</strong> won&rsquo;t tip over your bin in the middle of the night and make a 
big stinky mess.</p> 
<p><strong>So I started freezing my green bin waste regularly,</strong> taking 
it from the freezer to the bin on collection morning. And I also found that 
freezing leftover, spoiled dips and sauces, the remainders of pie stuck to a 
pie plate, and other food I should have eaten earlier makes it a lot easier to 
separate the food from its package. Last night I took a spoiled container of 
hummus out of the freezer, and I just stuck a (dull) knife into it and pulled, 
and the whole disc of frozen hummus popped out at once. Shhhhpock! I put it 
into the green bin and put the hummus container in the blue bin.</p> 
<p>So there&rsquo;s my tip for keeping more food &ndash; and containers 
&ndash; out of the garbage (while thwarting raccoons).<strong>Do you have a 
garbage-reduction tip to share?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>I have a great prize to get you started.</strong> The Eco-Clean 
Deck by Annie B. Bond (Random House, $18.99) is not a book, it&rsquo;s a deck 
of tabbed cards with recipes for homemade green-cleaning solutions.<br>
</p> 
<p><em><strong>Instructions</strong>: Simply post a garbage-collection tip 
below to win. That&rsquo;s it!</em></p> 
<p><em><strong>Rules:</strong> You must live in Canada and be at least the age 
of majority for the province or territory in which you live. Not open to 
employees of Transcontinental media, nor their families or anyone they live 
with. Prize will be drawn randomly from all entrants who comment with a 
garbage-reduction tip. Contest closes Monday, July 19 at 12 p.m. EST.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Good luck! I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing your tips!</strong>

<h2>Native wildflowers outperforming in the garden!</h2> 
<p><br>
 Super hot days? They can take it. Long stretches without rain, and no 
watering? They can take it. Hammering deluge of rain? They can take it.<strong> 
My native wildflowers, particularly the black-eyed Susans shown here, are 
thriving in the swings of extremes in my street-side front garden.<br>
</strong>
<br> While I like the sweet blossoms of non-native annuals, and I do have a few 
types of adorable pansies tucked into baskets here and there, I am so impressed 
with my native plants&rsquo; ability to deal with extremes. These black-eyed 
Susans (<em>rudbeckia hirta</em>) had lots of buds ready to pop, but they 
didn&rsquo;t do so until after a good rain. My pansies tried to bloom in dry 
conditions, and some of the little blossoms quickly faded, their thin fleshy 
stems collapsing in defeat when I was away for a long weekend and not there to 
water them. I don&rsquo;t mind coddling pretty flowers &ndash; they pay back in 
their cheeriness, but when a plant doesn&rsquo;t make it I replace it with a 
native perennial wildflower. Within a couple of years, hopefully I&rsquo;ll 
have a robust garden full of pretty wildflowers that just come up and put their 
mettle to the petal.</p> 
<p>Aside from black-eyed Susans, my garden family of native wildflowers 
includes wild columbine, yarrow, purple coneflower (Echinacea), woodland 
sunflower, and I&rsquo;m working on milkweed (most of the seeds I planted last 
fall didn&rsquo;t germinate).</p> 
<p>Are you growing any native wildflowers or other native plants this year?

<h2>What are fancy tea bags made of?</h2> 
<p>Making a cup of tea this morning, I paused to appreciate the simple pillow 
of Earl Grey tea wrapped in paper, a delicous gift from mom from her visit to 
Harrods. I like the idea of making tea with an infuser, but at work, with 
dozens of people sharing a kitchen, the handling process is not practical.</p> 
<p>I often try new kinds of tea, but<strong> I&rsquo;ve noticed a 
disconcerting trend:</strong>many new premium teas, espousing health benefits, 
are packaged in silk, and I discovered that those fancy &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; 
tea bags are made of nylon. The silk bags are natural fibres, sure, and could 
potentially break down given enough heat, microbes and time, but nylon? 
That&rsquo;s made from petroleum. Hope you had a great cuppa, &rsquo;cause that 
tea bag is forever, baby.<strong> I&rsquo;m not sure why these difficult or 
impossible to compost tea bags are considered &ldquo;premium.&rdquo;</strong> I 
think the companies like these materials because it&rsquo;s easier for us to 
see their premium ingredients.</p> 
<p>So I look for paper tea bags, particularly fair trade, organic teas in 
paper bags that don&rsquo;t appear bleached. Good tea in bags without labels 
and staples are even better (and make composting even easier).</p> 
<p>To learn all about tea, have a look at this terrific article here at 
homemakers.com.</p> <b>&nbsp;</b>  Tags: composting, tea bags <br>

<h2>Ontario's New Eco Fees: Protecting the environment?</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Communication about a new &ldquo;eco fee&rdquo; on some goods sold in 
Ontario has been less than stellar. I&rsquo;m usually contacted about 
environment-related announcements, and I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for this 
kind of information. But I didn&rsquo;t know about this program until it was 
mentioned on the TV news last night; the news crew showed people at a hardware 
store surprised by the new eco fee on their receipt. It seems thatall 
we&rsquo;re hearing from the governmentabout it is, &ldquo;This is not a 
tax.&rdquo; OK fine, but what, specifically is the fee meant to do?</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned so far: On July 1, Stewardship Ontario 
launched the &ldquo;Orange Drop&rdquo; program, a hazardous waste collection 
program. Consumers in Ontario will now be asked to take household hazardous 
waste to a collection point, and we will also see an &ldquo;eco fee&rdquo; 
added to the purchase of 22 types of goods, from household detergents to fire 
extinguishers, syringes to pharmaceuticals.</p> 
<p>From what Stewardship Ontario says, I&rsquo;m gathering that <strong>the 
program&rsquo;s reason for being is to more effectively divert hazardous waste 
out of landfills, and safely handle hazardous waste.</strong> Of course this is 
a very good thing in terms of protecting our water supply, among other 
benefits. The program provides drop sites across Ontario for our hazardous 
waste; you can search for siteshere. That&rsquo;s a lot more convenient than 
the infrequent collection opportunities offered by some municipal governments. 
Who wants to keep that kind of waste around for several months?</p> 
<p><strong>The fee side of the program</strong> is applied to companies&rsquo; 
products to cover collection, transportation and processing of this hazardous 
waste, essentially spent containers and other product packaging of various 
kinds. The fees Stewardship Ontario is charging each company are based on the 
number of units of product they distribute in the Ontario marketplace; the fee 
amounts are approved by the Ontario minister of the environment. So why are 
fees showing up when you buy certain goods? It appears that some companies have 
decided to pass the fee on directly to the consumer.</p> 
<p><strong>So how will we know if the program is really keeping hazardous 
goods out of landfills?</strong> And how will the nasty waste be dealt with 
exactly? I&rsquo;ll pose that question and get back to you!</p> <b>&nbsp;</b>

<h2>Saving plants from the heat</h2> 
<p>I thought they were dead. Like crispy-fried dead. The tomatoes that 
I&rsquo;d worked so hard bring to fruition (well, at least to fruit) had their 
leaves curled up, branches saggy, some of them tinged with yellow. Not without 
a fight, I thought, not without a little more effort to see some juicy red 
seedy globes in a salad later this summer.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d been away for three days, and although I&rsquo;d watered 
everything from my rain barrel before I left, it had been blindingly hot and 
uncomfortably humid, several degrees above seasonal norms (experts say climate 
change is a likely contributor) . My veggies, particularly my peppers and 
tomatoes, just couldn&rsquo;t handle that.</p> 
<p>I used rich, black soil when I&rsquo;d potted my veggies, mixed with some 
dead leaves and topped with a thick layer of mulch. But now the soil was 
compacted, likely thanks to heavy rains and then severe heat. Taking the pots 
into my makeshift plant hospital one by one, I tried to loosen up the soil by 
flexing the pots, adding more good soil and kelp meal, then adding a lot more 
mulch on top. I watered each plant thoroughly but lightly from my rain barrel, 
trying to urge the soil to absorb as much water as possible.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to conserve water, saving hose waterings for long 
stretches of dry weather, performed at night when the water would seep into the 
ground and lose less to evaporation. So far this year I&rsquo;ve only watered 
my garden this way twice. I usually just use a watering can and my rain barrel 
since saving water means protecting watersheds and conserving energy.</p> 
<p>I was rewarded for my efforts: this morning my potted veggies didn&rsquo;t 
look entirely better, but they were significantly perked up. In 30-degree heat, 
I think that&rsquo;s all I can ask for.</p> 
<p>Going forward, I think I&rsquo;m going to keep adding a bit of good soil, 
some leaves and mulch to my plants, to retain as much moisture as possible. And
<strong>next time </strong>I go away for a couple of days, I&rsquo;ll put those 
veggies in partial shade. They may not get all the sun they crave, but at least 
they won&rsquo;t be crispy.</p> 
<p>Have you brought any plants back from the brink?</p> <b>&nbsp;</b>  Tags:
