<h2>Tips</h2> 
<h4>1</h4> 
<p><strong>Install a low flow shower head&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Shower use 
accounts for about 1/5 of an individuals daily water use so reducing the amount 
of hot water used in the shower can go a long way towards yearly energy and 
water savings.</p> <br>

<h4>2</h4> 
<p><strong>Install an Ultra Low Flush or Dual Flush Toilet</strong>&nbsp;- 
Toilets are the single largest water guzzling appliances in the home and make 
up about 1/3 of an individuals daily water use.&nbsp;New ultra low flush and 
dual flush toilets use between 3-6 litres per flush compared to the traditional 
13-20 litres.</p> <br>

<h4>3</h4> 
<p><strong>Fix Leaks</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The most common areas for leaks in 
your home are faucets, showerheads and toilets. A leaky faucet alone can waste 
up to 55 liters of water per day and if left unchecked that could add up to 
over 20,000 liters per year!</p> <br>

<h4>4</h4> 
<p><strong>Run Full Loads&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Always try to run full loads 
when running your dishwasher and laundry. It is a very simple concept but it 
will go a long way towards saving water, time, energy and money.</p> <br>

<h4>5</h4> 
<p><strong>In the Garden</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; There are lots of way to cut 
down on water use in the garden. Rain barrels, drip irrigation systems, 
moisture sensors and choosing low water intensive plants and shrubs are all 
great options.</p> <br>

<h4>6</h4> 
<p><strong>Turn the tap off -&nbsp;</strong>Brush your teeth without the water 
running and save up to 31 litres per day.</p> <br>

<h4>7</h4> 
<p><strong>Eat less meat -</strong>&nbsp;It takes over 4,500 litres of water 
to make one average-sized steak!</p> <br>

<h4>8</h4> 
<p><strong>Use a refillable water bottle</strong> &ndash; millions of plastic 
water bottles are filling up the landfills each year. Plus, tap water costs 
less than a penny and it is absolutely delicious!</p> <br>

<h4>9</h4> 
<p><strong>Water a plant</strong> &ndash; If you drop an ice cube, place it in 
a plant instead of throwing it in the sink. The same goes for giving your pets 
new water &ndash; use the old water for a household plant.</p> <br>

<h4>10</h4> 
<p><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong> &ndash; Wash your fruits and 
vegetables in a pan of water instead of running water from the tap.</p> <br>

<h4>11</h4> 
<p><strong>Financial assistance</strong> &ndash; Get government grants for a 
low flush toilet (dual flush); there is even a toilet that also regulates water 
amount to type of use.</p> <br>

<h4>12</h4> 
<p><strong>Sweep!</strong> &ndash; Use a broom to clean your driveway of 
leaves instead of hosing it down. You&rsquo;ll save lots of water &hellip; and 
money!</p> <br>

<h4>13</h4> 
<p><strong>Flush</strong> &ndash; Never flush garbage down the toilet. You can 
also save lots of water by throwing tissues in the garbage instead of flushing 
it down the toilet.</p> <br>

<h4>14</h4> 
<p><strong>Cool water</strong> -&nbsp;Keep a pitcher of water in the 
refrigerator rather than running tap water until it is cool enough to drink.</p>
<br> 
<h4>15</h4> 
<p><strong>Pool Time -&nbsp;</strong>If you own a pool, be sure to use a pool 
cover when it&rsquo;s not in use. This will cut down on evaporation losses and 
will keep it cleaner and warmer.</p> <br>

<h1>Canada&rsquo;s Latest Drinking Water Report Card Released by Ecojustice!
</h1> <br>
<strong>November 15th, 2011 -</strong>&nbsp;Ecojustice, 
Canada&rsquo;s preeminent non-profit environmental law firm, has just released 
its 3rd Canadian Drinking Water Report Card titledWaterproof 3. The report 
evaluates water policies, programs and legislation across the country and gives 
the provincial, territorial and federal governments a grade based on their 
current efforts to protect drinking water. Although provinces such as Ontario 
(A) and Nova Scotia (A-) received excellent grades the overall findings of the 
report conclude that many other provincial and territorial governments along 
with the federal government are still failing to ensure all Canadians have 
reliable access to&nbsp;safe, clean water.<br>

<p>It is really unfortunate to see that our federal government received an 
&lsquo;F&rsquo; grade and we encourage you to visit theEcojustice website to 
view the full report and learn what can be done to improve source water 
protection in this country. Ecojustice has also put together an excellent video 
that provides some examples on how we can all help protect Canada&rsquo;s 
drinking water!</p>

<h1>Hello from the Arctic!</h1> 
<p>Alex and I just arrived in Reykjavik, Iceland this weekend and were 
immediately astounded by the beauty of this city. If you don&rsquo;t already 
know, Reykjavik is considered the &ldquo;greenest&rdquo; city on Earth. 100% of 
the electricity throughout Iceland and this relatively small city of 115,000 
people is generated from domestic renewable sources like geothermal and 
hydroelectricty. Some city buses actually run on hydrogen power and the country 
has set a goal to be fossil fuel free by 2050!</p> 
<p>The highlight of our time in Reykjavik had to be our surprise meeting with 
the President of Iceland, &Oacute;lafur Ragnar Gr&iacute;msson. Geoff Green 
from Students on Ice and our resident Icelandic geologist Ari Gudmundsson 
(always good to know an Icelandic geologist) were able to set up a special 
event with the president at the last minute and it was such an honour to have a 
chance to discuss Arctic climate issues with the head of state of an Arctic 
nation.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We also visited the Viking World museum and it was amazing to see how the 
Vikings have shaped Icelandic culture and traditions over the years. Below is a 
pic of Tyler and I trying to look tough in our viking helmets &hellip; I 
don&rsquo;t think we looked very authentic carrying backpacks but we tried our 
best to look the part under the circumstances.</p> 
<p>Iceland is definitely one of the most beautiful countries we have ever 
visited but we don&rsquo;t know why everything is so hard to pronounce. I think 
they just make up names for places (like the famous volcano Eyjafjallajokull) 
and have a laugh as tourists try to pronounce the places they want to visit. 
For example, on our second day we visited&nbsp;&THORN;ingvellir National Park 
(is that a P?) which is a UNESCO world heritage site and the location of 
Iceland&rsquo;s first legislative and judicial assembly in 930. Although we 
can&rsquo;t pronounce many names of the places we visited during our time in 
Iceland, the memories will still last a lifetime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h1>Happy World Water Day!</h1>  Happy World Water Day 
<p>Hey Everyone,</p> 
<p>Just wanted to wish you all a happy World Water Day. I hope that you are 
able take some time out of your day to learn about how you can help reduce your 
water footprint, and hopefully make a donation to a water charity of your 
choosing, or even better donate some of your time to a good water cause.</p> 
<p>Alex and i have both made donations to Water.org today and have agreed to 
not shower for the next 48 hours among other things. Sorry to everyone around 
us.</p> 
<p>We would also like to let everyone know that we are two weeks away from 
beginning to shoot our first episode called &ldquo;Reefer-Madness&rdquo;. As 
you may have guessed it&rsquo;s about the importance of Coral Reefs, and how we 
need to starting to taking better care of these fragile eco-systems with the 
introduction of more Marine Protected Areas&rsquo;s (MPA&rsquo;s). We are also 
going to look at the importance of Mangroves to these coastal areas, and the 
damaging effect, unchecked Coastal Development, can have on the Oceans. We will 
be traveling up the entire Meso-American Reef (2nd largest in the world), which 
spans from Honduras through Belize and up to Cancun, Mexico.</p>
