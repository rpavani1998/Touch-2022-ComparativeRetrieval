<h1> Water Conservation </h1> 
<h3>Conserve Water</h3> 
<ul> 
<h4> 
<li>Outside the House</li> 
<li>Inside the House</li> 
<li>No Leaks</li></h4> </ul> 
<p>See the sections below for useful tips on how to conserve water.</p> 
<p>Although there is no shortage of water in the lake it costs money to treat 
and distribute the water for domestic consumption. New drinking water standards 
&quot;Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand 2005&quot; were recently 
adopted, and compliance with this standard is&nbsp;obligatory&nbsp;following 
the adoption of the new Public Health Bill &nbsp;in 2008.</p> 
<p>To comply with the new Drinking Water Standards it will be necessary to 
build a new water treatment plant, and because of the additional treatment 
processes involved treatment costs will rise.</p> 
<p>All of the water used in the home, for example, clothes and dish washing, 
baths and showers, toilet flushing, leaking taps and toilet cisterns, is 
discharged to the sewer for treatment and disposal at the waste water treatment 
plant. Reducing the amount of water used in the home can reduce the cost of 
waste water treatment and could delay the increase of the waste water treatment 
plant capacity.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Outside the House</h2> 
<p>Being sensible with use of water in the garden and lawn is important as 
they are the biggest drain of these resources during hot weather when they are 
needed most.</p> 
<h5>Lawns</h5> 
<p>A lawn can use more water per square metre than any other area in your 
garden.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Water your lawn only when it needs it. A good way to test this is to step 
on the grass. If it springs back up when you move it doesn't need watering. If 
it stays flat it needs watering.</li> 
<li>Deep soak your lawn. While giving the lawn a quick drink every night may 
be good therapy for you, it makes the grass shallow rooted and dependent on the 
meagre amount of water that you provide. Water a maximum of twice a week, but 
for a longer period. This enables the&nbsp;grass to become more&nbsp;deeply 
rooted&nbsp; seeking out any moisture,&nbsp;in turn making the grass hardier.
</li> 
<li>Reduce the lawn area. This has the additional benefit of reducing your 
mowing.</li> 
<li>Check your local nursery for a suitable drought tolerant lawn grass for 
your area.</li> 
<li>Let the lawn go brown during very dry times. When the rain comes the 
transformation from brown to green will be dramatic.</li> 
<li>Give the lawn a feed but do not over fertilise. </li> 
<li>Aerate the soil to allow water to be absorbed more easily. </li> 
<li>Do not mow to a height of less than 2cm. Taller grass holds water better. 
</li> 
<li>Use a timer with your sprinkler. A forgotten sprinkler wastes more than a 
1000 litres per hour. A timer will allow you to use as much water as is needed 
without the threat of wastage.</li> </ul> 
<h3> </h3> 
<h5>The Garden</h5> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a good mulch. Mulches can prevent up to 73 per cent evaporation loss. 
Mulches can prevent excessive runoff, restrict weed growth, improve soil 
structure and help put valuable nutrients back into the soil.</li> 
<li>Group plants according to how much water they require. By grouping plants 
by water usage you can avoid waste on plants that don't need a lot of water.
</li> 
<li>Toughen up the plants. Too many plants are pampered to the point where 
they are so dependent on water that they do not go out of their way to find any 
water themselves. Wait until the soil dries out before watering and use a plant 
such as bamboo as an indicator. When the leaves start to droop, then water.<br>

Water the highest parts of the garden first. This ensures that any runoff water 
soaks into lower dry areas rather than being wasted.</li> 
<li>Remove weeds. Weeds compete for water and nutrients. </li> 
<li>Dig a small trench around the trees. This will give the water a chance to 
soak in and reduces water lost as runoff.</li> 
<li>Water your pot plants by dunking them in a bucket of water. Wait a few 
seconds, when the bubbles disappear, do the next pot. This saves water and 
ensures pot plants get a thorough drink.<br>
Water during cooler parts of the 
day.</li> 
<li>Avoid watering on windy days. </li> 
<li>Water the roots not the leaves. If you water the leaves water is lost 
through evaporation, and any chlorine in the water could damage the leaves.</li>
<li>Don't water the road or pathways. Position your sprinklers so water lands 
on the lawn or garden, not&nbsp;paved areas.</li> 
<li>Plant drought resistant native trees and plants. Many natives are both 
attractive and suited to gardens, and thrive with far less watering than do 
other species.</li> 
<li>Water wisely to avoid runoff. Soil and dissolved nutrients are carried 
away with runoff, which increases the need for expensive fertiliser and can 
pollute nearby streams.</li> 
<li>Use a trigger hose. This allows you to be in control and water is not 
wasted when moving the hose around. Always remember to turn the tap off when 
finished in case the pressure build-up causes the nozzle to pop off.</li> </ul> 
<h3>The Yard</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Discourage games with the hose and sprinklers. Squirting water around can 
waste up to 1000 litres per hour.</li> 
<li>Use a broom not a hose to clean driveways and footpaths. Cleaning a path 
with a broom is quicker and more efficient than using a hose, which can waste 
up to 1000 litres per hour.</li> 
<li>Every home should have a compost bin. Compost improves the structure of 
your soil. This increases the moisture holding capacity of sandy soils and 
allows better penetration of water into heavy clay soils.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Swimming Pool</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Cover your pool to reduce evaporation, retain warmth and keep out leaves 
and dirt. Up to 200 litres of water per day can be lost because of evaporation 
from a typical ground pool.<br>
Accept some fluctuation in pool level due to 
evaporation and rainfall. They will often compensate for each other, meaning 
topping up with the hose can be avoided.</li> 
<li>Check the pool for leaks</li> </ul> 
<h3>Washing the Car, Boat or Caravan</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a bucket and sponge to wash the car, boat or caravan. Use the hose 
only for rinsing and turn it off between rinses.</li> 
<li>Wash the car, boat or caravan on the lawn instead of on the driveway.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Inside the House</h2> 
<h3>The Bathroom</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Install a dual flush toilet. Modern toilets give the option to flush 
either half or all the cistern's water. Traditional toilets can usually be 
converted to dual flush.</li> 
<li>Take shorter showers. Limit showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash 
down, and rinse off. Remember that shorter showers also save on hot water costs.
</li> 
<li>Install a water-saving shower rose. Many showers put out 20 litres of 
water per minute, however, 10 litres is enough for a refreshing, cleansing 
shower.</li> 
<li>There is no need to run water down the plughole while brushing your teeth. 
Just wet your brush and fill a glass for rinsing.</li> 
<li>Don't rinse your razor under a running tap. Fill the sink with a little 
warm water for rinsing. This is just as effective as running water and far less 
wasteful.</li> </ul> 
<h3>In the Laundry</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Make sure the washing machine's load adjustment is right for the load. If 
there's no load adjustment, wait until you have enough clothes for a full load. 
Washing machines use 100 - 200 litres of water per load.</li> 
<li>Front loading machines are generally more efficient than top loaders and 
save water and power. Also use the sud-saver option when several loads have to 
be washed.</li> </ul> 
<h3>In the Kitchen</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>When washing dishes by hand, don't rinse them under a running tap. If you 
have two sinks, fill the second one with rinsing water. If you have only one 
sink, stack washed dishes in a dish rack and rinse them with a pan of hot water.
</li> 
<li>Don't run the automatic dishwasher until you have a full load. </li> 
<li>Don't let the tap run when cleaning vegetables. Just rinse them in a 
plugged sink or a pan of clean water.</li> 
<li>Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator. Running the tap until 
the water is cool enough to drink is wasteful. Aerating taps are inexpensive 
and can reduce water flow by 50 per cent.</li> 
<li>When cooking, use only a little water in the saucepan and keep the lid on. 
</li> 
<li>Garbage disposal units use about 30 litres of water per day and send a lot 
of extra rubbish into the sewers. This places an additional load on the sewage 
treatment plants. Perhaps some of your food scraps could be used in the garden.
</li> 
<li>When buying a new appliance that uses water, be sure it has a high water 
conservation rating.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Hot Water Pipes and Systems</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Insulate hot water pipes. This avoids wasting water while waiting for hot 
water to flow through and saves power.</li> 
<li>Make sure your hot water system thermostat is not set too high. Adding 
cold water to cool too hot water is wasteful.</li> 
<li>If you have a spa, ensure it is well insulated to keep water warm for 
longer. Reheating the water during the reticulation/spa process reduces water 
wastage.</li> </ul> 
<h2>No Leaks</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>If you have a water meter, turn all taps off before you go to bed one 
night and take a meter reading. Check the meter the next morning before any 
water is used. If the meter reading has advanced, and no-one used any water 
during the night, you may have a leaking pipe, tap or toilet cistern. Locate 
the problem and repair it.</li> 
<li>A slow drip from a tap can waste more than 200 litres of water per day. 
Turn taps off properly and check washers for wear.</li> 
<li>A continuously running toilet can waste more than 16,000 litres of water 
per year. To check for leaks put a little food colouring in the tank. If 
without flushing, the colouring begins to appear in the bowl, the cistern 
should be repaired immediately.</li> </ul> Weather <br>
