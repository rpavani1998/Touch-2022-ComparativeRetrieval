<h2> Saving Water </h2>  Water is life. Nearly three quarters of the surface 
of the planet is covered by water and planet earth might be better described as 
planet water. We waste and contaminate it at our peril.
<p>We take fresh water very much for granted. Turn on the tap - and there it 
is. It is easy to forget how precious water is. The average person in the 
United Kingdom now washes away a staggering 1,000 litres of water a week.</p> 
<p>Just stop for a moment and think what life would be like if you had to walk 
for two hours to a well and carry each bucket of water back to the house</p> 
<p>The heavy usage of the water table is disrupting the natural systems and 
affecting plants and animals. As climate change accelerates, rainfall patterns 
will alter and, in some areas, water supplies will become depleted. Building 
more reservoirs and transporting water causes environmental problems such as 
loss of habitats and damage to fragile eco-systems. If we use water more 
sensibly we can significantly alter the situation.</p> 
<p>As well as reducing the volume of water that we use, we must also ensure 
that water pollution is tackled effectively. This will protect both our health 
and the wider environment.</p> 
<p>2.4 billion people on our planet do not have access to safe water and 2 
billion lack adequate sanitation or water to grow crops. The impacts of climate 
change are likely to affect the people who have the least responsibility for 
carbon emissions, and very little capacity to respond to the major droughts, 
floods and increasing climatic disruption.</p> 
<h3>1. A shower or a bath?</h3> 
<p>A five-minute shower consumes approximately thirty-five litres of water, 
half the amount of water - and energy - that a full bath takes. And five 
minutes is a long time in the shower! Add a fine spray attachment to your 
shower so that you use even less water. If you have a bath, make sure you 
re-use the water. Pre-soak washing, water the garden with the water, or use it 
to wash the floor or windows.</p> 
<h3>2. Repair all leaks and drips immediately, install a low-flush toilet and 
ensure that your water company is maintaining adequate standards and not 
wasting water</h3> 
<p>Often, all that a dripping tap needs is the washer replaced - yet this 
simple step can stop up to 5 litres of water leaking away each day. Flushing 
the loo accounts for over a third of our water use. Installing a low-flush 
toilet means that you have a choice of two flushes - a long one or a short one 
- and this greatly reduces the amount of water used. If you cannot have one of 
these installed, try carefully putting an insoluble object in the cistern to 
reduce the amount of water used in each flush. Many of the water companies 
provide suitable bottles and bags.</p> 
<p>In some areas of the United Kingdom, more than a third of our water supply 
is being lost through leaky pipes. Find out from OFWAT what your water 
company's record is. If it's bad, write and insist they invest more of their 
profits in water conservation. Water companies are legally obliged to state 
when levels of contaminants in tap-water breach European Community limits. By 
reporting all such infringements, you can encourage prosecution of offenders 
and force an improvement in the quality of tap water (contact OFWAT for 
details).</p>

Street,<br>

<p><strong>Your local water supplier</strong> - see your local telephone 
directory.</p> 
<p>If you don't feel you have got an adequate response from your water company 
or OFWAT, you could consider buying a single share in the water company for a 
few pounds and then go along to the Company AGM to ask questions and challenge 
the Directors and Management on their environmental performance. You will often 
find that other share-holders will have similar concerns.</p> 
<h3>3. Make the most of rainy days by collecting rain-water</h3> 
<p>Invest in a rainwater collection system to flush your toilets, you will 
substantially reduce the volume of treated water used.</p>

<h3>4. Re-use household water and use water sparingly. Drink tap water not 
bottled water.</h3> 
<p>Water the garden with your bath water and washing up water (let it cool and 
make sure your detergents are eco-friendly). You'll be surprised at how much 
running water is wasted. Fill up a mug with water and use it to clean your 
teeth, rather than leave the tap running.</p> 
<p>The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management has pointed 
out the substantial fuel costs, and thousands of tonnes of harmful emissions 
involved in transferring over 22 million tonnes of bottled liquid from country 
to country every year. In contrast, tap water is provided by a comparatively 
efficient infrastructure of underground pipes and plumbing. It is insane to pay 
to throw away a plastic bottle when tap water is often of better quality.</p>

<h3>5. Don't contribute to water pollution</h3> 
<p>Try out some detergent-free &lsquo;eco-balls' and natural soap pods in your 
washing machine. Check loo cleaners and household products for ingredients that 
might damage water organisms. If you're not sure what it is or what it does, 
and the manufacturer won't give you clear answers - don't use it!</p>

<h3>6. Avoid disposable nappies and use real nappies and your local nappy 
exchange</h3> 
<p>Disposable nappies form 4% of household waste in Britain costing the tax 
payer &pound;40 million each year to dispose of them. The cost to the 
environment is even greater: in the UK alone, we discard 9 MILLION SOILED 
NAPPIES EVERY DAY. These are put into landfill sites, and can take up to 500 
years to decompose.</p>

<p>Buy re-usable nappies that you can wash. Find out if there is a local nappy 
exchange. These groups can help you save money and reduce the amount of 
resources wasted in producing and washing nappies.</p>

<p>Many local councils' support and subsidise nappy washing services. Contact 
your waste disposal or environmental health department and ask if there is such 
a service in your area. (Numbers in the Phone Book under the name of your Local 
Authority).</p> 
<h3>7. Give up or eat meat as a real treat</h3> 
<p>It takes 500 litres of water to produce 1kg of potatoes, 900 litres per kg 
of wheat, 3,500 litres per kg of digestible chicken flesh and a massive 100,000 
litres for 1kg of beef. By these figures, producing one kilogram of beef uses 
as much water as: 40 baths, 300 toilet flushes, and 100 times the clean water 
needed by an individual according to UNESCO</p> 
<p>Since a large percentage of the crops we feed to our farmed animals are 
grown on 'ghost acres' in developing countries, this wasted water is coming not 
just from our own reserves but from the very countries where drinking water is 
most scarce. Not only is eating less meat good for your health, the water and 
energy saving is very high.</p> 
<p>World meat production has quadrupled in the past 50 years and livestock now 
outnumber people by more than 3 to 1. In other words, the livestock population 
is expanding at a faster rate than the human population. A cow will produce 
120kg of methane per year, which as a powerful greenhouse gas, is the 
equivalent of 2.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p>
