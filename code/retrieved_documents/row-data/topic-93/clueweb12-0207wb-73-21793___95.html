<h1>Superintendent McKay to recommend Robert Rhodes as next Principal of 
Horace Greeley High School</h1> 
<p><strong>Current Millennium High School Principal offers expertise in 
professional, team, program and communal development.</strong><br>
<br>
 
Thursday, February 16, 2012<br>
<em>CCSD PRESS RELEASE by David Hayes</em></p> 
<p><em>Chappaqua, N.Y.</em>&mdash;At the February 28th Board of Education 
meeting, Lyn McKay, Superintendent of the Chappaqua Central School District, 
will recommend the appointment of Robert Rhodes as the next Principal of Horace 
Greeley High School, effective July 1, 2012.</p> <br>

<p>Rhodes is the founding and current principal of Millennium High School in 
lower Manhattan&rsquo;s financial district. Established in 2002 in an effort to 
revitalize the area following the September 11th attacks, MHS is an inclusive 
college preparatory high school that provides a rigorous liberal arts academic 
program in a responsive and flexible learning environment. As founding 
principal, Rhodes was instrumental in reaching out to and creating an advisory 
board composed of students, parents, community members, local business 
officials and politicians; recruiting all staff and students; articulating 
curriculum in all subject areas; securing millions of dollars in grant funding; 
and he even had a hand in the school&rsquo;s layout and design. He also 
established a four-year student/teacher advisory program, all of which has 
resulted in steady 98% graduation and college placement rates.</p> 
<p>With a focus on writing, critical thinking, analytical skills, exhibitions, 
presentations, and service to community, Rhodes has created one of the top 
ranked and most sought after high schools in NYC. So much so that for the 
2011-12 school year, 5,300 eighth-graders applied for only 150 openings, and 
several schools based on Rhodes&rsquo; model now are opening throughout the 
City.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhodes has a passion for learning and for teaching students to 
pursue their own ideas,&rdquo; commented Lyn McKay. &ldquo;From budgeting and 
long-term planning to curriculum design and professional development, he is 
well versed in the many facets of school operations and has a proven track 
record of putting students first and creating a learner-centered environment 
where everyone can succeed.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Rhodes has worked for 21 years in NYC public schools. He began his career 
in education in 1990 as a math teacher at a small alternative high school in 
Jamaica, Queens. In 1993, he joined School of the Future&rsquo;s humanities 
department and five years later transitioned to the administration team serving 
as assistant principal.</p> 
<p>Originally from Shaker Heights, Ohio, Rhodes graduated from Sarah Lawrence 
College in 1990 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Social Science and in 1997 
received a Master of Science Degree in Educational Administration from Fordham 
University. In 2003 he received Clark University&rsquo;s Secondary Educator of 
the Year Award and in 2008 was awarded a Cahn Fellowship designed by Teachers 
College to recognize outstanding principals. He lives in Brooklyn and has two 
children.</p> 
<p>Should the Board of Education approve Superintendent McKay&rsquo;s 
recommendation, there will be opportunities in the near future for the 
Chappaqua community to meet Mr. Rhodes and to welcome him to the district.</p> 
<p><em>David Hayes is Public Information Officer for the Chappaqua Central 
School District.</em><br>

<h1>A peek at Millennium High School through its website</h1> 
<p>Thursday, February 16, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>At 7:30 this morning, Superintendent Lyn McKay met with Horace Greeley High 
School staff in K-110 to announce her recommendation for the school&rsquo;s 
principal position: Robert Rhodes, the founder and current principal of 
Millennium High School of District 2, in the Financial District in Lower 
Manhattan.&nbsp; MHS is a public high school of a little over 600 students in 
grades 9 through 12&mdash;less than half of Greeley&rsquo;s current 
population.&nbsp; About 10% of its students receive special education 
services.&nbsp; Students apply for admission, and preference is given to those 
living below Houston Street.&nbsp; Below, see official<em>School Profiles</em> 
for MHS and HGHS.</p> <br>

<p>According to Inside Schools, a non-profit group that describes itself as 
&ldquo;Your independent guide to NYC public schools,&rdquo; class size at MHS 
currently operates &ldquo;close to the contractual limit of 34, especially in 
the upper grades.&rdquo;&nbsp; Occupying several floors of an office building 
near Wall Street,Inside Schools notes, the school has no gym; students 
&ldquo;take physical education either in the fitness center or the 
multi-purpose room that also doubles as an auditorium.&rdquo; Drama and music 
are offered only after school.</p> 
<p>Judging from its own website, Millennium High School places great emphasis 
on student exhibitions&mdash;for which &ldquo;students must write a term paper 
and present their ideas before a committee&rdquo;&mdash;and attaches great 
importance to its Advisory system, in which each advisor acts as an advocate 
and as primary contact with parents for 15 to 20 students.&nbsp; Advisors 
remain with their group, meeting three times a week, throughout the four years 
of high school.&nbsp; In addition, according to Millennial&rsquo;s website, 
&ldquo;each Advisory group plans and completes a Community Service Learning 
Project.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>On February 28, McKay will recommend to board of education members that 
they appoint Rhodes to begin as Greeley&rsquo;s principal on July 1, 2012.</p> 
<p>Below is some information taken from Millennial&rsquo;s website:</p> 
<p><strong>Academic Program</strong></p> 
<p>All MHS students take four years of English, Social Studies, Mathematics, 
and Science, as well as three years of Foreign Language (currently offered are 
Spanish and Mandarin).&nbsp; There are two to three hours of homework each 
night and 20 hours of annual community service to fulfill.</p> 
<p>There is a strong emphasis at MHS on reading and writing in all classes 
with an approach to literacy that begins in 9th and 10th grade.&nbsp; Students 
take English five times a week and read classic books such as<em>Frankenstein, 
1984, Othello,</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em> with the dual goals of 
understanding complicated narratives and learning how to write traditional 
literary analysis papers.&nbsp; Classes also include units on poetry, the 
persuasive essay, editorial, and oral history.</p> 
<p>The 9/10 core curriculum establishes a foundation of critical thinking 
skills and features key content infused into all classes.&nbsp; The core 9/10 
academic sequence includes English, Biology/Chemistry, Global History, Math, 
Foreign Language, as well as Physical Education/Health and Art.&nbsp; Students 
are prepared for Regents exams, the school&rsquo;s Exhibition process, and for 
the greater interdisciplinary work of 11th and 12th grades.</p> 
<p>In 11th and 12th grades students choose thematic elective and/or Advanced 
Placement courses that prepare them for the Comprehensive English and the U.S. 
History &amp; Government Regents exams. Math and Science courses include 
Algebra 2, Precalculus, Calculus, Advanced Biology, Advanced Chemistry, 
Advanced Physics, Advanced Geology, and Anatomy.&nbsp; Students may enroll in 
college classes via the College Now program at NYU, Pace, Baruch and BMCC for 
simultaneous high school and college credit. There are also elective courses in 
Art such as Photography, AP Studio Art, Mixed Media, Yearbook, and Graphic 
Design.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Advisory</strong></p> 
<p>An important part of life at MHS is its Advisory system. All new students 
are assigned to an Advisory that remains together through 12th grade. Advisory 
meets three times per week for all four years of high school. The advisor is 
the student&rsquo;s advocate in the building and functions as the primary 
contact with parents. All advisors have 15 to 20 students in their Advisory and 
remain with their group for the four years.</p> 
<p>In 9th grade, Advisory focuses on creating a community and how to be 
successful in high school.&nbsp; Each Advisory plans and completes a Community 
Service Learning Project.</p> 
<p>In 10th grade, Advisory follows a similar trajectory with an accelerated 
timeline.&nbsp; During the second semester, the advisor works with the class on 
their first of three exhibitions that teach the process of independent 
research. A committee of students and teachers assesses the final project.</p> 
<p>In 11th and 12th grade, Advisory focuses on the college process in depth, 
in addition to helping guide the students through the required exhibitions and 
supporting academic and social growth.</p> 
<p><strong>Exhibitions</strong></p> 
<p><strong>ABOUT EXHIBITIONS AT MHS</strong></p> 
<p>Sophomore year marks the commencement of the MHS exhibition process.&nbsp; 
It is a key step in the school&rsquo;s mission to prepare students for 
college.&nbsp; By promoting high expectations, exhibitions also encourage all 
students to develop themselves as learners.&nbsp; MHS staff support students 
though this rigorous, independent study project each year in 10th, 11th, and 
12th grade.&nbsp; In order to graduate, students must complete three 
exhibitions, one per year.</p> 
<p>For an exhibition, students must write a term paper and present their ideas 
before a committee.&nbsp; The paper is based on a question the student chooses 
to answer and includes evidence from a variety of sources.&nbsp; The 
presentation offers the student an opportunity to share with a committee 
his/her reflective process for conducting the research and developing the 
written piece.&nbsp; Students created their own research questions based on 
their experiences in school.&nbsp; Each student will complete one Math or 
Science and one Humanities (English, Spanish, History, Art) exhibition before 
preparing a final project in 12th grade.</p> 
<p>Each year, students are assigned a sponsor who will support him/her through 
the research, writing and presentation phase of the exhibition.&nbsp; Students 
are expected to conduct their research outside of school time and to negotiate 
a schedule to meet with their sponsors.&nbsp; Interim deadlines will be 
provided so that students can complete components of the project at different 
times.&nbsp; No student will be allowed to present until s/he meets standards 
for the written portion of exhibitions.</p> 
<p>10th graders begin to prepare their first exhibitions in their spring 
semester.&nbsp; Because it is their first experience with the exhibition 
process, we have created some special systems to support them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; * Advisors serve as sponsors, meeting with students regularly and 
closely monitoring student progress.<br>
 &nbsp; * Several Advisory sessions 
are be devoted to teaching and reviewing skills students may need to meet the 
standards of the project.<br>
 &nbsp; * Students complete a modified version of 
the paper that is much longer in their junior and senior years.</p> 
<p>We expect students to feel a great sense of pride throughout the process as 
they become experts in their chosen field of research and as we celebrate their 
topics in school.</p> 
<p><br>
 There are two components to earning a diploma from Millennium High 
School: Course Credits and Regents exams.<br>
<br>
 COURSE CREDITS: In order to 
graduate from Millennium High School you need four years of English, Social 
Studies, Mathematics, and Science, and at least three years of Spanish or 
Mandarin. You must have full class schedules for 9th-11th grades and you may 
have one free in 12th grade. In 9th &amp; 10th grades you will take English, 
Global History, Math, Biology/Chemistry, Foreign Language, Art, Phys Ed, 
Health, and Advisory. In 11th &amp; 12th grades you may request courses in each 
required subject and electives. All students must complete 1 semester of 
Government, 1 semester of Economics, 1 year of Physics, and 1 year of Algebra 
II or equivalent. Qualified students may take AP courses. Simultaneous high 
school credit is offered for college courses at local institutions.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>REGENTS OR EQUIVALENT EXAMS: To qualify for a Regents Diploma, students 
must achieve 65 or higher on 5 required NY State Regents exams. To qualify for 
an Advanced Regents Diploma, students must also achieve 65 or higher on 4

<p></p> 
<p>Students with disabilities may qualify for a Local Diploma by passing the 
required Regents exams with scores of 55-64.<br>
<br>
 ARTICULATION POLICY: In

<h1>NEW: Merchants of the Week: Rich and Amy Glotzer, Millwood Drug Mart</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Photos by Kevan Full, at kevanslens.com; see more in Photo Gallery
</em><br>
 Friday, February 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>Full disclosure:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known Rich and his wife Amy for 25 plus 
years.&nbsp; One day I&rsquo;m taking a high school biology class with 
Amy&mdash;the next day she&rsquo;s my pharmacist!</p> <br>

<p><strong>When did you two open Drug Mart in Millwood?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> After several years of working as pharmacists in New 
York City, we decided to open up our own store. We opened for business on June 
1st in 1995 and moved to Millwood just a few months later.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I think you opened your law office a few months 
later.&nbsp; Ms. Marvin, our biology teacher, would be proud.</p> 
<p><strong>Is must be nice living minutes from your store, did you close your 
store in Bedford Hills because your commute was too far?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>It&rsquo;s true the Bedford Hills commute was twice 
as long as Millwood&rsquo;s (four miles as opposed to two) but that&rsquo;s not 
the reason we sold the store.&nbsp; We had been operating the Bedford Hills 
store for six years with nine years still left on our lease.&nbsp; We were 
approached by our landlord because CVS was interested in moving into the 
shopping center.&nbsp; After some thought, we decided to sell the Bedford Hills 
store and focus all of our attention on Millwood.&nbsp; Bigger isn&rsquo;t 
always better.</p> 
<p><strong>How is running a store with your wife? I know who&rsquo;s a better 
skier but who&rsquo;s a better pharmacist?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> It&rsquo;s a pleasure working with her. As you can 
imagine, it is not always easy but the good far outweighs the bad.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy: </strong>What bad? </p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>As far as who is a better pharmacist, no comment. 
</p> 
<p><strong>Amy: </strong>He&rsquo;s trying to redeem himself.&nbsp; I spend 
most of my time now focusing on the front end of the store. I&rsquo;m always 
trying to find fun and different items to offer our customers.&nbsp; And, yes, 
Richie is a better skier.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s leave it at that.</p> 
<p><strong>Rich, I grew up with your dad&rsquo;s Drug Mart in Spring 
Valley.&nbsp; Not too many Independent pharmacies survived. Is must be tough 
competing against the big chains.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> It can be difficult competing with chain pharmacies, 
but Independents can definitely thrive.&nbsp; What sets us apart is great 
customer service and our connection with the community. That, combined with 
competitive pricing, has kept our business going for over 16 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> We also accept every major prescription plan and the 
co-pay is the same as what you pay at the chain pharmacy.&nbsp; So if you pay 
the same, wouldn&rsquo;t you want great service too?</p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>And, by the way, more than 45 years later, my dad is 
still running his store.</p> 
<p><strong>Congratulations on being voted &ldquo;Best of Westchester&rdquo; by 
Westchester Magazine and &ldquo;Top 50 Independent Pharmacies in the 
Country&rdquo; by Drug Topics Magazine.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the secret of your 
success?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> It&rsquo;s always an honor being recognized by your 
peers and community.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Unfortunately, Westchester magazine no longer has a 
best Pharmacy category.</p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> As far as our success, my dad always says, 
&ldquo;customer service is the bottom line&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Living in the same community, sharing the same 
experiences and having a personal relationship with your customers definitely 
helps.</p> 
<p><strong>Your web site is a great resource. Customers can refill 
prescriptions, you have a drug &amp; health center, recipes &amp; even 
e-coupons. How&rsquo;s your online catalog doing?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>The website is a work in progress. So far 
we&rsquo;ve had a positive response and we are always looking to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>Amy: </strong>Sales are starting to pick up and will definitely 
improve once we finish adding all the gifts and other products we sell. Check 
it out:www.drugmarts.com</p> 
<p><strong>Have you always been so active with community events?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>Yes. Whether it&rsquo;s coaching sports or donating 
to local charities and schools, we always make time to help out.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with the turf committee.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy: </strong>When you live and work in your community it&rsquo;s 
important to be involved in what&rsquo;s going on.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think the town could do to make conditions better for 
business in Millwood?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> Millwood has a great mix of stores. We have 
everything you need to shop. The sidewalk was a great addition to Millwood but 
it would be even better if the loop was completed to connect the town.</p> 
<p><strong>Do you find yourself drinking a lot of Tazza coffee throughout the 
day?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich: </strong>Tazza is great, but I&rsquo;m not a big coffee 
drinker.&nbsp; Never liked the taste. I had one cup my freshman year at Boston 
University to wake me up for an early class. I dropped the class and stopped 
drinking coffee.&nbsp; I do, however, love their frozen hot chocolate.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy: </strong>We have a great shopping center.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not 
big but it&rsquo;s got a great assortment of stores&hellip;.a bank, liquor 
store, supermarket, dry cleaner, cafe, post office, and, of course, a family 
owned drug store.</p> 
<p><strong>Any discount or giveaway for NewCastleNOW readers who mention this 
article?</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> Sure, a free stress ball.</p> 
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What&mdash;a sport?!?!?</p>

<h1>NEW: The Cupcake Conspiracy: A benefit for Friends of the Chappaqua Library
</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>At the Chappaqua Library Theatre on Saturday, March 3, at 7:30 
p.m.&mdash;a cupcake to go with every ticket!</strong><br>
 February 17, 2012
<br> <em>by C.J. Ehrlich</em></p> 
<p>Come to a staged reading of a new comedy to benefit the Friends of the 
Chappaqua Library! Every ticket you buy&mdash;$12 for adults, $10 for 
kids&mdash;supports quality library programs. Go to theChappaqua Library 
homepage. Pssst! Click on the cupcake flyer at the bottom of the front page.</p>
<br> 
<p>Who&rsquo;s afraid of THE CUPCAKE CONSPIRACY?&nbsp; What do we know about 
this CUPCAKE CONSPIRACY?&nbsp; Is it a new comedy?</p> 
<p><strong>FACT:</strong> C.J. Ehrlich and Philip J. Kaplan are both known 
playwrights who collaborated on this comedy of mistaken identity and terrorism.
</p> 
<p><strong>Why &ldquo;Terrorism is easy. Marriage is complicated&rdquo;? 
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>ASK YOURSELF:</strong> What happens when a not-quite separated 
husband goes on a blind date behind his wife&rsquo;s back, and meets a 
beautiful terrorist obsessed with cupcakes?</p> 
<p><strong>Is it a staged reading? </strong></p> 
<p><strong>KNOWN:</strong> There will be movement and props, but the actors 
will be holding scripts and a Narrator will allegedly fill in the action. 
Sounds a little suspicious? THE CUPCAKE CONSPIRACY is a work in progress. This 
version has never been performed in front of an audience. By being in the 
audience and laughing (or not), you&rsquo;ll help the playwrights fine tune the 
play. You&rsquo;ll be able to say that you helped shape THE CUPCAKE CONSPIRACY 
(but don&rsquo;t try and claim any residuals). Afterward, you can stay and 
probe the actors for more information.</p> 
<p><strong>Is it a benefit for the Chappaqua Library?</strong> </p> 
<p><strong>YES!</strong> Every ticket you buy supports quality library 
programs. Go to theChappaqua Library homepage. Pssst! Click on the cupcake 
flyer at the bottom of the front page.</p> 
<p>(And feel free to make additional, lavish donations. Think of the Chappaqua 
Library as artificial turf that even non-athletes can enjoy.)</p> 
<p><strong>Just who are these people? </strong></p> 
<p><strong>RUMOR: </strong>The actors, with numerous stage, film and TV 
credits, come from NYC and Westchester. Chappaqua actors in the cast include 
Charley Riggs, Carmel deRosa, Neil Agarwal and Chris Valenti, a Greeley 
student. Playwrights Philip J. Kaplan, of Brooklyn and C.J. Ehrlich, of 
Chappaqua have both had numerous productions of their plays all over the 
country, and in Canada.</p> 
<p><strong>Is it an opportunity to taste some delicious cupcakes? </strong></p>
<p><strong>ROGER.</strong> Every ticket comes with one free mini-cupcake. 
Additional cupcakes can be purchased at intermission courtesy of Sweetooth 
Katonah, who are donating profits to the Library.</p> 
<p>You can purchase a ticket online HERE.</p> <br>

<h1>NEW: Great biking news: Ride between Van Cortland Park, Bronx, to Brewster!
</h1> 
<p>Friday, February 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Mark Tulis</em></p> 
<p>Over the past winter Westchester County and Putnam County finished 
construction on two of the three remaining gaps in the South County-North 
County -Putnam County Rail Trails located on the old Putnam Line Rail bed. The 
first new section in Yonkers, from Dunwoodie Park to Tuckahoe Road is 
approximately 1.75 miles long and eliminated a dangerous descent on Mile Square 
Road to Tuckahoe Road.&nbsp; The new section meanders through Parkland and 
travels under Tuckahoe Road, which is far safer than crossing a dangerous 
intersection. See the map below.</p> <br>

<p>The second new section in Putnam County connects Tilly Foster in Putnam 
County to its new terminus on route 6, only one mile from the Brewster train 
station.&nbsp; The new section avoids the heavily traveled sections of Route 6 
and contains a beautiful section that crosses the reservoir. The entire Putnam 
section, which is 11 miles long and parallels Route 6, has many breathtaking 
portions that cross watershed land.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Brewster to the NYC Subway: 47.2 miles</strong></em></p> 
<p>It will now be possible to travel from Brewster to the New York City line 
at Van Cortlandt Park for a total of 47.2 miles on bicycle trails other than 
the 1 mile detour in Elmsford!&nbsp; The trail continues through Van Cortlandt 
Park for an additional 1.75 miles on a dirt trail.&nbsp; Both Metro-North 
trains and the Subway are easily accessible from the Van Cortlandt Park 
terminus.</p> 
<p>The Elmsford section, which ends at Warehouse Lane and requires traveling 
on either 9A (dangerous) or the commercial area to its west on Nepperhan Avenue 
(watch for glass and nails!!) to Route 119 where the main section of the South 
County trail starts adjacent to Pete&rsquo;s Tavern. The Elmsford detour may 
not be replaced with a bike trail for years because the County transferred 
ownership of the Rail bed to the SPCA and because a boardwalk will have to be 
built along and over the Saw Mill River for 200 yards or so under Route 287. We 
had been told that the bike trail would be built when the new Route 9A bypass 
was built in Greenburgh to relieve traffic on Route 9A, but such major new 
construction projects do not seem achievable for the forseeable future. So take 
Nepperhan and be careful for a few more years. It&rsquo;s worth it to bike the 
South County Trailway!</p> 
<p><strong>Now, </strong><em><strong>everybody wants the bike path!</strong>
</em></p> 
<p>Ironically, the construction of the new Yonkers section of the bike path 
was blocked for many years by its neighbors, who were fearful of crime and 
didn&rsquo;t want their personal use of a portion of the trail bed as their 
backyards disturbed!!&nbsp; Luckily a change in the County Board allowed the 
work to be done.</p> 
<p>When I first proposed the Millwood portion of the bike path in 1999 and the 
Yorktown section in 2003 I heard the same arguments from residents of Millwood 
and later in Yorktown when we extended the path to Yorktown Heights!&nbsp; 
People thought it would diminish their property values rather than increase 
values by providing such an amenity.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s great to see that public 
opinion of the bike path has changed and is now viewed as an economic engine. 
And it cheers me to see so many people using the path all year round!</p>

<h1>NEW: Empty Bowls Soup Supper to benefit local food pantries</h1> 
<p><strong>Handmade bowls created by local potters filled with delicious soups 
donated by local restaurants.</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Soup, bread . . . and keep 
the bowl!</em><br>
 Friday, February 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Penny Vane</em></p> 
<p>On <strong>Monday, March 12</strong>, the potters of New Castle, in 
collaboration with a number of local merchants and community groups, will host 
our area&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Empty Bowls&rdquo; event, part of a global 
movement to raise awareness and support for organizations working to alleviate 
hunger. It&rsquo;s an all-volunteer effort, so all of the money raised will be 
given directly to the Mt. Kisco Interfaith Food Pantry and the Interfaith 
Emergency Food Pantry in Pleasantville.</p> <br>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re invited to join friends and neighbors for a simple 
soup supper anytime between 5 and 8 p.m. at the First Congregational Church, 
210 Orchard Ridge Road in Chappaqua. Admission is $25/person.</strong>&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ll choose your handmade bowl from those on display, then fill it with 
your choice of one of the delicious soups provided by Crabtree&rsquo;s Kittle 
House, Jardin du Roi, Gail Patricks, Taylored Menus, Via Vanti, Ladles of Love 
and the new King Street Restaurant &amp; Bar.&nbsp; Live music by local 
musicians will add to the festivities.&nbsp;<strong>Please note that 
registration is limited by the number of available bowls and reservations must 
be made in advance.</strong>&nbsp; Guests are encouraged to also bring 
non-perishable food items to help stock the pantries&rsquo; shelves. 
(Reservation information below.)</p> 
<p><em><strong>What is the Empty Bowls movement all about? </strong></em></p> 
<p>The basic premise is simple:&nbsp; Local artists collaborate with local 
merchants and community organizations to host an Empty Bowls event.&nbsp; For a 
modest ticket price, guests share a simple meal of soup and bread, and they are 
invited to keep their handcrafted bowl as a reminder of all the empty bowls in 
the world. The money raised is donated to an organization working to end 
hunger.&nbsp; Hundreds of Empty Bowls events have now taken place across the 
United States and in at least a dozen other countries, raising millions of 
dollars for hunger-fighting organizations.&nbsp; Read more about the 
international Empty Bowls initiative atwww.emptybowls.net.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Hunger is on the rise everywhere, including right here in 
Westchester.</strong></em></p> 
<p>Most clients of local food pantries are families with children whose 
parents are out of work for extended periods; elderly people having trouble 
making ends meet; and those with unforeseen medical issues straining family 
budgets.</p> 
<p>&bull; The Mt. Kisco Interfaith Food Pantry serves an average of 175 
households per week. The Interfaith Emergency Food Pantry in Pleasantville 
counts about 100 people among its regular clients, who come twice a month for 
non-perishables. Both pantries distribute fresh produce once/month.</p> 
<p>&bull; In 2011, the MKIFP distributed 188,727 pounds of food &mdash; a 33% 
increase over 2010.</p> 
<p>&bull; In addition to food drives and generous donations from member 
religious institutions, scout groups and so on, both pantries depend on cash 
donations to purchase the majority of their food from the Westchester Food Bank.
</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Every $1 provides $4 of food that stays in our community to 
help hungry children and families.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Who is involved in this project?</strong></em></p> 
<p>Like other Empty Bowls events worldwide, this is a collaborative project 
meant to involve as many people and local organizations as possible.&nbsp; The 
bowls are being created by all the adult potters working out of the New Castle 
Art Center.&nbsp; The soups are being donated by the participating restaurants 
and caterers.&nbsp; Several local musicians are donating their time and 
talent.&nbsp; A number of merchants, religious institutions and local 
organizations are making contributions to materials costs and providing other 
services for the event.&nbsp; (A complete list of sponsors will be available on 
the day of the event.)&nbsp; The organizing committee includes Lisa Fitzgerald, 
Anne Gans, Ruth Parnes, Andrea Samuelson and Penny Vane.&nbsp; Lisa and Ruth 
are active volunteers with each of the two local food pantries; and Anne, Ruth, 
Andrea and Penny are all teaching potters at the New Castle Art Center.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Make your reservations now.</strong></em></p> 
<p>Although the potters are still busy making lots of unique and beautiful 
handmade bowls, registration will have to be limited by the number of bowls 
available!&nbsp; Reservations are first-come, first-served and must be made in 
advance.&nbsp; Please make your check payable to Mt. Kisco Interfaith Food 
Pantry and mail to: Empty Bowls, c/o Anne Gans, 15 Glen Terrace, Chappaqua 
NY.&nbsp; Please include a note with your name, phone and email address so that 
we can send you confirmation of receipt.&nbsp; Your name will then be on a list 
at the door on the day of the event.&nbsp; Help us help our neighbors keep food 
on their family&rsquo;s table this winter.</p>

<h1>Town board reviews PPS report on Millwood and ponders next steps</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 10, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>At its work session last Tuesday, the town board members began their 
discussion of the newly-completed Project for Public Spaces (PPS) preliminary 
report on suggested improvements to the Millwood hamlet.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great start,&rdquo; said board member Jason Chapin. 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to hear what Millwood residents have to say about it 
and then talk about next steps.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<p>The PPS report included demographic and income data taken from the 2010 
Census, calling Millwood &ldquo;an extremely wealthy community. The median 
household and per capita incomes are significantly higher in the area 
immediately surrounding Millwood than in Weschester County,&rdquo; with 
&ldquo;a predominance of families with young children.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>PPS identified three trade areas, with Millwood as the center (and 
wealthiest)&mdash;containing around 2,000 households with a median household 
income in 2010 of $177,000 and median per capita income of $77,000&mdash;ringed 
by two others. This center Millwood population is described as &ldquo;highly 
educated. 77% of the adults over 25 have a college degree and over half of 
those also have a graduate or professional degree.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Most-visited destinations, shops and services that are lacking, suggested 
goals for the hamlet and a useful summary of the 1999 &ldquo;Millwood Design 
Guidelines&rdquo; are all included in the report.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Development of bike trail seen as big economic boost</strong>
</em></p> 
<p>The PPS report had much to say about the economic advantages of developing 
the County bike trail as a defining feature of Millwood.</p> 
<p>This struck a chord with board member Robin Stout.&nbsp; &ldquo;I use the 
bike trail weekly,&rdquo; he said, agreeing that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a tremendous 
resource and we have to figure out a way to beautify it, put more retail and 
connect it to other retail.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was also critical of the PPS 
report. &ldquo;Having seen a number of [such reports], I think some points in 
the report are relatively self-evident.&rdquo; Supervisor Susan Carpenter 
agreed. &ldquo;They do an economic analysis and a walk through, but not a lot 
of questions were answered. We really need to get a handle on who uses the 
hamlet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what they use it for, and what they want that 
they don&rsquo;t find there.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I disagree with the two of you,&rdquo; said board member Elise 
Mottel. &ldquo;PPS&rsquo;s scope of work was quite limited.&nbsp; We did not 
engage them for a full-blast study,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We wanted to do 
this first, to jump start it very quickly. This is only Phase 1. We need to 
figure out how to go forward.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>PPS consultants walked the Millwood hamlet with town planner David Brito 
and several members of the Millwood Task Force over the summer. PPS was paid 
around $6,000 to work up their &ldquo;Phase 1&rdquo; report.&nbsp; Phases 2 and 
3 are outlined in the Phase 1 report [a link is below], though no cost is 
specified.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Are enough people aware yet?</strong></em></p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not convinced,&rdquo; said Carpenter, &ldquo;that the 
report&rsquo;s particular view of what comes next will work in Millwood.&nbsp; 
When PPS worked on a plan for the Chappaqua hamlet several years ago, they got 
people to come to visioning sessions at the Bell school.&nbsp; There had been a 
huge amount of discussion for a long time before that. We have to see how we 
can get that going.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t engage them to do that in this report,&rdquo; 
said Mottel.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;My point is,&rdquo; said Carpenter, &ldquo;that we have to have 
residents engaged and I don&rsquo;t think they are right now.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Board members suggested reaching out to such groups in Millwood as 
merchants and condo residents at Pheasant Run and Ledgewood Commons.&nbsp; 
Board member John Buckley suggested the town produce a map of the Millwood 
hamlet &ldquo;to help focus on what we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo; and that the town 
and Millwood Task Force set up meetings with merchants.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the names of all the merchants on that side of town so 
we can keep them in the conversation we&rsquo;re having.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mottel 
suggested publishing the report on the town&rsquo;s website,mynewcastle.org.</p>
<p><em><strong>Town Board holds its March 13 meeting at Westorchard</strong>
</em></p> 
<p>The town board will hold a joint meeting with the Millwood Task Force on 
Tuesday, March 13, at 7:45 p.m. at the Westorchard Cafeteria.&nbsp; The PPS 
report will be on the agenda.</p> 
<p>The 20-page report is also available in pdf form by clicking <strong>
Project for Public Spaces Phase 1 Memo</strong>. If you are a gmail user, NCNOW 
has reproduced the PPS report in Google docs, which enables any number of users

<p><em><strong>Here are some excerpts from the report:</strong></em></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&bull; Notably, household size in the primary trade area is significantly 
larger than in the secondary and tertiary trade areas and even in Westchester 
County as a whole. The relatively large household size would indicate a 
predominance of families with young children. p. 4</p> 
<p>&bull; As would be expected given the relatively large proportion of 
families with children, the percent of the population of the primary trade area 
under the age of 18 is greater than in the surrounding areas. However, less 
predictably, the median age is older &ndash; 43.7 years in 2010, and compared 
to 39.9 in Westchester County. This is due to a population that is skewed 
toward the 35-65 age group, a population that tends to be in the prime of 
professional life and at the peak of earning potential. p. 5</p> 
<p>&bull; Millwood is an extremely wealthy community. The median household and 
per capita incomes are significantly higher in the area immediately surrounding 
Millwood than in Westchester County, with the highest income households in the 
primary trade area. p. 6</p> 
<p>&bull; Population in Primary Trade Area: 6,400 in 2,000 households, about 
3.09 persons per household</p> 
<p>[Median household income and median per capita income are very close 
to&mdash;approximately the same as&mdash;those of Chappaqua]</p> 
<p>Median Household Income in 2010: $177,000<br>
 Median Household Income in 
2015: $216,000</p> 
<p>Median Per Capita Income in 2010: $77,000<br>
 Median Per Capita Income in 
2015: $91,500</p> 
<p>&bull; The population in the primary trade area is highly educated. 77.8% 
of the adults over 25 have a college degree and over half of those also have a 
graduate or professional degree. p. 6</p> 
<p>&bull; On p. 8 of the report, see where you fit in the 
demographics&mdash;and what your group&rsquo;s characteristics are:</p>

<h1>Merchant of the Week:&nbsp; Whispering Pines for Valentines</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Photos by Kevan Full, at kevanslens.com; see more in Photo Gallery
</em><br>
 February 10, 2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>In order to score even more points with my wife, after picking up a 
hand-crafted Valentine&rsquo;s Day card at The King&rsquo;s Scribe on Lower 
King, I decided to order some flowers at Beth Hungden&rsquo;s<em><strong>
Whispering Pines</strong></em> at the top of the hill.&nbsp; A gigantic heart 
on her porch marks the spot.</p> <br>

<p><strong>You are the only full-service florist in Chappaqua. When did you 
open?</strong><br>
<br>
 Yes we are!&nbsp; We opened seven years ago in a cute 
little shop on Memorial Drive, then moved up onto 117 next to Quaker Hill 
Tavern where we stayed for five years. Our present location is by far the best 
and we are here to stay.<br>
<br>
<strong>Besides flowers and plants, what 
other inventory do you carry?</strong><br>
<br>
 We carry a wide variety of 
&ldquo;the perfect gift&rdquo; items ranging from exotic candles to outdoor 
statuary.&nbsp; Everything in the store is very unique and representative of 
who we are.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Besides floral arrangements, I understand 
you also sell fruit and food baskets?</strong> <br>
<br>
 Yes, we make fabulous 
fruit baskets with fruits that are in season, local gourmet products like 
BobbySue&rsquo;sNuts and Tate&rsquo;s Cookies from Southampton as well as great 
local honey to make things more unique and memorable.<br>
<br>
<strong>I would 
imagine it&rsquo;s tough to compete with nationwide companies.&nbsp; Are you 
affiliated with any network?</strong><br>
<br>
 We&rsquo;re affiliated with 
Teleflora and FTD, but our style shines through our work.&nbsp; As a small 
business with passion and pizzazz, we stay true to the art of floral design<br>

<br> <strong>Tell me a little more about your garden design and installation 
service, as well as your holiday home decorating service?</strong><br>
<br>
 
Spring is coming!&nbsp; We do a lot of patio and pool container 
plantings.&nbsp; Clients often have existing pots that we will come and plant, 
or we order them the containers they choose.&nbsp; For the past three year 
Whispering Pines has had a contract with the town and has planted all of New 
Castle&rsquo;s town flowerpots. The holiday season is just as busy&mdash;with 
home holiday decorating both inside and outside.&nbsp; It is very rewarding to 
make people&rsquo;s holiday season beautiful!</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
<strong>You must do you lot of parties&mdash;Bar and Bat 
Mitzvahs, weddings and corporate events&mdash;any good war stories?</strong><br>
<br> After 30 years, there are some pretty good stories.&nbsp; Like the one 
time my high heel broke and I had to decorate an entire wedding space limping 
along on only one shoe.&nbsp; On the day-of, there are so many things that can 
happen!&nbsp; But we adapt and always pull it off.<br>
 &nbsp; <br>
<strong>
What&rsquo;s your busiest time of year?</strong><br>
<br>
 Mother&rsquo;s Day 
and Valentine&rsquo;s Day are tied, naturally.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Are you 
active in the community?</strong><br>
<br>
 I&rsquo;m on the Beatification 
Advisory Board of Chappaqua &ndash; that&rsquo;s a good use of me. Being apart 
of the community here is very rewarding.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, February 14, representatives from Conifer Realty will present 
town board members with their plan for 36 affordable rental apartments on the 
16,617 square foot property where the Chappaqua Drama Group building once 
stood. Most recently, the area was used as a staging ground for construction 
vehicles and materials for the Route 120 bridge.</p> <br>

<p>The project, called &ldquo;Chappaqua Station,&rdquo; will contain a mix of 
24 one-bedroom units and 12 two-bedroom units ranging in size from 669 square 
feet to 975 square feet.&nbsp; The first floor will be dedicated to parking, 
with four floors of residential above it.</p> 
<p>As originally conceived and rendered in plans by architect Gary David 
Warshauer of WMW Architects in Hawthorne, N.Y., the third floor lobby of the 
building (the second residential floor above the ground-level parking) will 
connect directly with the new bridge by means walkway through a landscaped 
terrace for residents of the building.&nbsp; Plans include a community room 
with computer stations, an exercise room and laundry room on the first floor of 
the building.&nbsp; The property&rsquo;s 16,617 square feet includes around 
2,000 square feet if right-of-way that the town intends to sign over to Conifer 
to provide more leeway to a property with little room for setbacks.</p> 
<p>Specializing in high-quality affordable housing, Conifer currently manages 
and owns over 11,000 apartment units in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and 
Pennsylvania, and has about 25 projects in various stages of development.&nbsp; 
Conifer is known for managing and maintaining the housing it constructs.&nbsp; 
The company will also monitor income eligibility requirements of applicants and 
will submit a plan to the town outlining how limitations on rental costs will 
be calculated over time. The units will count toward the 750 units of fair and 
affordable housing the county is required to produce by 2016.</p> 
<p>Since last appearing before the board, Conifer has negotiated funding with 
the State and County and has performed soil tests on the Hunts Lane property, 
which had a previous life as a petroleum storage depot.</p> 
<p>In Tuesday&rsquo;s 7:45 p.m. town board meeting, the presentation by 
Conifer follows announcements and reports by the town supervisor and 
administrator.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Letter to the Editor: Greeley grad urges hard look at the cost of longer 
m.s. periods</h1> 
<p>February 12, 2012<br>
<strong>With 27 comments since publication</strong>
<br> <em>by Henry Koster, 2010</em></p> 
<p>Since last year&rsquo;s budget debates, and my contribution to the 
discussions that year (see ,&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cut teachers at the high school
,&rdquo; 3/25/12), I have remained interested in the challenges that the 
district faces amid the many changes that have been taking place recently. So 
when I came home from college recently for a short break before the start of my 
spring semester, I was sure to ask my family about the newest developments.</p> 
<br> 
<p>One of the first things I was told was that the district had decided upon 
the new schedule for the middle schools&mdash;next year students will have six 
55-minute classes each day instead of the current schedule of eight 40-minute 
periods. While this is bringing the district supposed savings of approximately 
$500,000 per year (though it could actually be less as Seven Bridges may need 
to hire one or two new teachers), I immediately questioned how this will impact 
the students.</p> 
<p>My first reaction was to the diminished time that students will spend 
learning foreign languages. Just a few years ago the district was advocating 
for as much time spent studying languages as possible, espousing the 
long-established belief that learning a language requires constant 
reinforcement and development. Students will progress more quickly in a foreign 
language if engaged with it every day even if during shorter class periods than 
they would if given longer classes less frequently. And under next year&rsquo;s 
schedule, students will receive 8 or 10 (I&rsquo;ve seen differing numbers) 
fewer hours of instruction in their language of choice in the form of longer 
classes held only two out of every three days. Over the four years of middle 
school, these lost hours add up to the equivalent of a full quarter of a school 
year.&nbsp; So already students are losing.</p> 
<p>They will also receive four fewer hours of music instruction, and two hours 
less of all other non-core classes in exchange for an additional 48 hours of 
instruction in their four core classes (math, science, English, and social 
studies).</p> 
<p><em><strong>Weigh the trade off</strong></em></p> 
<p>Under their current contract teachers are required to teach up to 225 
minutes per day.&nbsp; However, until now the middle school schedule has worked 
in such a way that they only teach 200 of those minutes.&nbsp; Because they 
were under their limit, an arrangement was made with teachers to spend an extra 
two hours per week after school on Mondays and Wednesdays for various meetings 
and other school-related purposes. The extra-help sessions that are currently 
offered&mdash;giving extra help to students who need a little more time to 
fully grasp a concept, need to make up a test or assignment that they missed, 
or to get an extra study session before an upcoming exam&mdash;fall in this 
&ldquo;school-related purposes&rdquo; category. These sessions were never 
required of teachers, but they were &ldquo;recommended,&rdquo; and teachers 
were more than willing to spend the extra time. Recently, however, it was 
announced that the new middle school schedule of 55-minute periods will bring 
teachers so close (220 minutes) to their contractual daily limit that the 
tradition of Monday/Wednesday afterschool help will not continue.</p> 
<p>The district administration has been so focused on cutting expenditures 
that they have shown little regard for the effect it would have on 
students.&nbsp; These changes will eliminate a critical resource currently 
offered to middle school students. Having the opportunity for students to meet 
one-on-one or in small groups with teachers to go over material that they 
didn&rsquo;t fully understand during class is something that we cannot afford 
to do without.</p> 
<p>This kind of extra help is a central part of education even at the 
collegiate level offered in the form of professors&rsquo; office hours. At the 
middle school level, where students are learning the groundwork for years of 
more complex classes to come, it allows students to gain the fullest and 
deepest possible understanding of topics before the class moves on. We all know 
that classes build upon themselves and the ones that come before, using 
previously established ideas to develop and derive more complex concepts.&nbsp; 
A student who doesn&rsquo;t get the help he or she needs to stay with the class 
will all too quickly find themselves falling further and further behind their 
peers. And though some claim that the longer class periods will allow teachers 
to work more meaningfully with students during the longer periods of the school 
day, this after-school help is designed for those students who need additional 
aid, not for the entire class. Not everyone learns at the same rate, and this 
resource is crucial for leveling the playing field.</p> 
<p>Of course, this is not to say that there is no longer any opportunity for 
students to find extra help after school. But because teachers are 
contractually limited to only 225 minutes, this does mean that any time that 
teachers spend at school after 2:40 pm will be their own time, unpaid, 
volunteering to help their students. And as I firmly believe that American 
teachers (and ours are no exception) are underpaid for the work that they do, 
why should they help students outside scheduled classes out of the goodness of 
their hearts?</p> 
<p>This is clearly a fundamental flaw with the new middle school schedule for 
next year, and one that should have been foreseen. Not only did we have our own 
district administration working to devise options for the new schedule, but the 
district even paid to have an expert come in and work with us to come up with 
the best possible options for our schools. And to be honest, I&rsquo;m not 
entirely sure which possibility is worse: the district being so focused on 
cutting costs that they didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to the ramifications 
that their changes would have on the quality of education being offered to even 
realize what they were doing; or the district knowing that this would happen 
and consciously keeping it hidden from the public because the potential savings 
were the only priority. Either way there are deep-seated problems with the way 
this district is going about the business of trying to save money and cut costs.
</p> 
<p>I fully recognize the problems and challenges we all face in today&rsquo;s 
world, and I know that changes need to be made in the way education is funded 
and delivered in our district. But that being said, we also need to be sure 
that we don&rsquo;t lose sight of what we are all really working towards: the 
best possible education system that this town can offer for our students. With 
this in mind, we need to be extremely careful of unforeseen consequences when 
we make decisions regarding scheduling and staffing at our schools. This is a 
time when we need to come together as a community and make tough choices about 
what we can afford and what we might need to do without, but it is imperative 
that we do so while having complete information so we can make informed, 
calculated decisions while preserving the tradition of excellence that we all 
have worked so hard to achieve.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<h1>Greely, Roaring Brook principal searches wrapping up</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 12, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>This week, second-round interviews for the two Greeley and three Roaring 
Brook principal candidates concluded and third-round interviews began.&nbsp; In 
its January 31 meeting, the board of ed heard updates on the searches from Paul 
Citarella, Interim Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, Grafflin 
Principal Mike Kirsch and Westorchard Principal Jim Skoog.</p> <br>

<p>Citarella described all five principal candidates as 
&ldquo;excellent,&rdquo; all currently employed, taken from an applicant pool 
of 147 for the high school and 187 for Roaring Brook. He did not reveal whether 
any candidates were currently working within the CCSD.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The five candidates were interviewed at each school by committees of 14 (at 
Greeley) and 12 (at RB) members that included administrators, teachers, staff, 
parents and&mdash;in the case of the Greeley search&mdash;two students as well. 
Out of fairness, the committees were careful to ask the same questions of each 
candidate.</p> 
<p>On February 3 and 6, the two finalists for Greeley spent 11-hour days, 
meeting with board of ed members, students, support staff and parents.&nbsp; 
They stopped for lunch, then met with administrators and ended with 
Superintendent Lyn McKay.&nbsp; They were asked, in the course of their 
in-school visits, to produce an on-demand writing sample and to explain a 
previous project or initiative they had worked on.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Third-round visits required a walk through the buildings to visit 
classrooms with McKay and Eric Byrne, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum, 
who, according to Citarella, judged &ldquo;candidates&rsquo; ability to observe 
and pinpoint instruction and curriculum in the classroom, asking candidates 
what they saw and what they might do in particular situations, and how they 
might coach teachers.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Next come reference checks, checks of previous employment experiences and 
background checks. Then Citarella and McKay will meet with candidates to 
discuss salary and personnel issues, and finally McKay will make her 
recommendations for each position in late February or early March.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Although attempts have been made to keep the identities of the finalists 
confidential, as board member Jeffrey Mester noted, once candidates appear for 
rounds in the schools, confidentiality is breached.&nbsp; &ldquo;We<em>try</em> 
to keep it confidential,&rdquo; said McKay.</p> 
<p>Of 147 who applied for the high school spot, 27 were sitting principals, 75 
were &ldquo;other administrators,&rdquo; and 43 candidates were 
&ldquo;other.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the 197 candidates who applied for the Roaring 
Brook opening, 56 were sitting principals, 80 were &ldquo;other 
administrators,&rdquo; and 61 were designated as &ldquo;other.&rdquo; A 
substantial number, said Citarella, had applied for both positions.&nbsp; The 
majority were from the tri-state area.</p> 
<p>The next scheduled board of education meeting is on Tuesday, February 28, 
when McKay will present a proposed budget to the board.</p> <br>

<h1>Whether to codify &ldquo;social-emotional-physical well-being&rdquo; as a 
third &ldquo;Strategic Question&rdquo;</h1> 
<p>Monday, February 6, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>In their work session last Tuesday, Board of ed members discussed whether 
to add a third &ldquo;Strategic Question&rdquo; to the board&rsquo;s existing 
two (one on balancing an excellent education with fiscal responsibility, the 
other on ensuring that students think critically and acquire 21st century 
skills).</p> <br>

<p>[The district&rsquo;s mission statement and two existing strategic 
questions are reprinted at the end of this article.&nbsp; The February 15 
Knowledge Cafe to discuss this issue has been rescheduled for Wednesday, April 
25.]</p> 
<p><em><strong>A useful touchstone</strong></em></p> 
<p>Superintendent Lyn McKay and Assistant Superintendent Eric Byrne told board 
members that elevating this third element of student life to the status of 
&ldquo;Strategic Question&rdquo; would provide the board and administrators 
with a touchstone against which they could view all their actions or 
initiatives&mdash;in the same way they use the existing two, McKay reminded 
them&mdash;as either promoting the intent of the strategic question or not.</p> 
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Do we have social-emotional issues covered 
already?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is it the school&rsquo;s place to cover them?&rdquo;
</strong></em></p> 
<p>Board member Randy Katchis posited that the CCSD mission 
statement&mdash;which includes the language, &ldquo;We will help [students] 
learn how to manage freedom and to act ethically&rdquo; [see below for full 
text]&mdash; and existing two strategic questions [also below] covered the 
purposes of the proposed third, social-emotion-physical question well 
enough.&nbsp; Fellow board member Karen Visser was most skeptical of codifying 
an area in which parents are the prime guardians and guides for their children.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; said Visser, &ldquo;my gut feeling is &ldquo;this is 
<em>my</em> job. As a parent, my child&rsquo;s social and emotional well-being 
is<em>my</em> responsibility.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&ldquo;I would frame it differently,&rdquo; said board member Jeffrey 
Mester. &ldquo;We need to come up with common standards&mdash;what we can offer 
[students] in our schools in terms of a safe environment, not so much 
values.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Board president Alyson Kiesel weighed in. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think 
we&rsquo;re talking about detailed values.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more about 
respecting people&rsquo;s needs and social and emotional development and 
understand how that interplays with our primary purpose: academic.&nbsp; 
Because the &lsquo;social and emotional&rsquo; impacts on how they perform at 
school.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We want to create that environment,&rdquo; added Katchis, 
&ldquo;where the [existing] strategic questions can be accomplished to the best 
of individuals&rsquo; ability without creating obstacles we have control 
over.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As to ethics and boundaries, &ldquo;The trouble with those,&rdquo; said 
Mester, &ldquo;is that you have to be able to enforce them and consistently 
apply them.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We do have a Student Code of Conduct,&rdquo; McKay reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, guardrails on the highway,&rdquo; said Katchis.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;All this is already happening,&rdquo; said Kiesel, fresh from the 
board&rsquo;s walking tour of Westorchard Elementary (which they found very 
exciting, they all reported earlier in the meeting), &ldquo;when they read<em>
Big Al</em> [a children&rsquo;s book by Andrew Clements, in which a big, 
scary-looking fish has trouble making friends with handsome little fish] and 
learn not to judge someone by their looks.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s<em>happening</em>
, in texts.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I think we have to step back and ask why we do what we&rsquo;re 
doing,&rdquo; said Tipp. &ldquo;Not just teaching them to do well in 
school&mdash;good grades, good SAT scores&mdash;but to become successful human 
beings in the world.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the definition of success?&nbsp; High 
income?&nbsp; Test scores?&nbsp; To be able to manage their lives in the world: 
what does it take to do that?&nbsp; What will enable them to succeed, to be 
resilient, confident, and to cope with stress and have good 
relationships.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s what we mean about values&mdash;not 
religion, but things other than academic skills.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;So do we need to put [these intangibles] into a third strategic 
question,&rdquo; asked Tipp, &ldquo;or continue to embed them in the current 
questions?&nbsp; And, if we create a third question, are we bound to commit 
district resources and . . . do we<em>have</em> those resources?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;[The social-emotional considerations] are now a subset of teaching 
and learning,&rdquo; said Katchis. &ldquo;We teach kids every day resiliency, 
&lsquo;go to work on these skills,&rsquo; &lsquo;get better at what 
you&rsquo;re doing.&rsquo; I think that&rsquo;s going on in the district 
already.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Later in the discussion, Visser provided an example.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;no drinking for the football team?&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There should be a code of conduct for sports,&rdquo; Mester 
responded.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking less of rules with punitive measures,&rdquo; said 
Tipp.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was looking in terms of how to teach self-confidence, 
resilience, to be a contributing member of society.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;How do you measure such a thing?&rdquo; asked Katchis. &ldquo;How do 
you ensure that?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you create the question,&rdquo; said McKay, &ldquo;we can create 
measurements.&nbsp; There are ways to observe and measure. You want to think 
first about &lsquo;Do we want to raise the level of awareness about social and 
emotional well-being?&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, we do.&nbsp; If this is what we expect, 
how can we measure?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that like asking &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s for lower 
taxes?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mester.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Of course</em> we&rsquo;re 
for it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;So what is the difference,&rdquo; asked Tipp, &ldquo;between having 
it [already] in the mission statement and putting it into a third strategic 
question?&nbsp; Because our mission statement<em>means</em> something.&nbsp; Is 
it more actionable if it&rsquo;s a strategic question?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; McKay responded. &ldquo;We can actualize each of those 
questions.&nbsp; It raises the level of awareness.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we necessarily succeed in our mission 
statement,&rdquo; said Mester. &ldquo;Maybe putting it in a third strategic 
question highlights it to the community.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>The discussion of the Third Strategic Question starts at the 33:00 
minute mark in the video of the board&rsquo;s meeting and lasts about 30 
minutes.&nbsp; The video, from NCCMC.org, is embedded below.</em></p> 
<p><strong>CCSD Mission Statement</strong></p> 
<p>The mission of the Chappaqua Schools is to create a community for learning, 
where students, parents and staff are joined in the pursuit of academic 
excellence and personal growth in a caring environment. We seek to develop each 
student&rsquo;s full potential through a challenging curriculum, a diversified 
faculty, and a commitment to intellectual freedom. We will teach basic skills, 
foster creative and critical thinking, and provide a foundation for life-long 
learning. We will nourish our students&rsquo; emotional lives and guide their 
social development, instilling in them an appreciation of self-worth, of 
individual difference, and of global interdependence. We will help them learn 
how to manage freedom and to act ethically so that each may become a 
responsible, contributing member of society.</p> 
<p><strong>Strategic Question 1 (budget/operations)</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp; &ldquo;How can the District ensure continuing excellence in academic 
and extracurricular programs while developing a budget that is fiscally 
responsible?&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Strategic Question 2 (teaching and learning)</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;How can the District ensure that all students think deeply, support 
their thinking, apply problem-solving skills, and actively participate in their 
learning as they acquire content knowledge?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The board of ed&rsquo;s next meeting is Tuesday, February 28, at 8:15 p.m. 
On the agenda is &ldquo;Budget Discussion&mdash;School Programs and 
Staffing.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<strong>&bull; Parents of Seven Bridge student struck by truck sue 
driver, CCSD, Town and County</strong></p> 
<p>According to a report by Elizabeth Ganga in yesterday&rsquo;s Journal News, 
the parents of the student (age 14 at the time) struck by a truck on his way to 
Seven Bridges school filed suit in November in State Supreme Court in White 
Plains against the truck driver, the school district, the town and county, 
&ldquo;saying that the governments,&rdquo; according to Ganga, &ldquo;all had a 
duty to provide safe routes to school and to install traffic-control devices 
and a crosswalk.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In her article, Ganga writes, &ldquo;the lawsuit argues that the school 
district should have known that [the student, who lives nearby] and other 
students walk to school.&nbsp; The lawsuit says neither the children nor their 
parents were ever told not to walk.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In recent a &ldquo;Knowledge Cafe&rdquo; discussion of the budget, several 
parent participants suggested that, to save money, busing routes be changed to 
enlarge the area surrounding each school that is<em>not</em> provided bus 
pick-up because distances are considered walkable.&nbsp; At that time, Chow 
noted that although the three elementaries, Bell and Greeley all have such 
areas designated as too-close-for-bus-service, in the case of Seven Bridges 
there is<em>no</em> area exempt from bus service.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>According to Ganga, the police determined at the time that the truck driver 
was traveling south on Seven Bridges Road &ldquo;below the speed limit and was 
not at fault.&rdquo; The student was, she wrote, &ldquo;carrying a lacrosse 
stick and wearing earphones, ran out from behind a stopped SUV and was hit by 
the truck. He was thrown into a guide rail and a stone wall on the side of the 
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; His was transported to the hospital with a fractured skull.

<h1>THIS SUNDAY: Chappaqua Community Garden Second Season Kickoff Meeting</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 10, 2012<br>
<em>by Suzi Novak</em></p> 
<p>Many of us in Chappaqua would like to try vegetable gardening, but have 
been daunted by too much shade or too many deer.&nbsp; The solution?&nbsp; A 
community garden, made possible by the generosity of the Chappaqua Volunteer 
Ambulance Corps and the leadership of InterGenerate, a local non-profit 
established to give more people access to fresh, healthy food.&nbsp; We are 
kicking off the 2012 season with a meeting and workshop on starting seeds 
indoors on<strong>Sunday, February 12 from 3:30 to 5:00 pm at the 
Children&rsquo;s Program Room in the Chappaqua Library</strong>.</p> <br>

<p>The Ambulance Corps permitted InterGenerate to build a fenced-in garden on 
their property; there are 22 beds that can be rented for $50 per season, which 
runs from April through October.&nbsp; To make sure that even people in need 
can get fresh food, there is a dedicated Giving Garden with four beds tended by 
Girl Scout troop 2747.</p> 
<p>There are a limited number of plots available for the coming garden season; 
if you are interested in gardening or thinking about renting a plot, join us! 
All levels of gardening expertise are welcome.&nbsp; For more information, 
email Suzi Novak.(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).</p> 
<p><em>Suzi Novak is a board member of InterGenerate.&nbsp; Since retiring 
from her teaching career at Horace Greeley she has become passionate about the 
environment.&nbsp; She speaks about sustainable food and helps establish 
community gardens.&nbsp; Suzi is the co-coordinator of gardens in Chappaqua at 
the Volunteer Ambulance Corps and in Mt. Kisco at the Marsh Sanctuary.</em></p>

Writers Contest!</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>Deadline for submissions is March 30, 2012</strong><br>
 
February 6, 2012<br>
<em>by Cheryl Jacobs Ehrlich</em></p> 
<p>Winter&rsquo;s wonky this year! Get inspired by the sunshine and start 
writing! The 32nd Annual Young Writers Contest is now open for entries. Each 
year the Friends of the Chappaqua Library sponsors the Young Writers Contest, 
to find and recognize writing of merit in the community.&nbsp; All students, 
grades 6-12, residing in the Chappaqua Central School district or enrolled in 
Chappaqua schools may enter the contest.</p> <br>

<p>The three categories for submissions are:</p> 
<p><strong>Fiction</strong> (short story, drama);</p> 
<p><strong>Non-fiction</strong> (essay, journalism, humor, descriptive prose); 
and</p> 
<p><strong>Poetry</strong></p> 
<p>First, second and third prizes are awarded in each category, at both the 
middle school and high school levels. High school winners are announced at the 
spring Awards Assembly.</p> 
<p>As always, this year&rsquo;s contest will be judged &ldquo;blind&rdquo; by 
a panel of writing and editing professionals. Judges never know the identities 
of the writers, and vice versa.</p> 
<p>Manuscripts should be submitted on paper, in quadruplicate. In past years, 
the Friends of the Chappaqua Library absorbed the cost of copying each 
manuscript to distribute to judges; the Friends of the Library save hundreds of 
dollars (applied to other programs) when entrants provide the copies.</p> 
<p>The Young Writers Contest Entry Form and the official rules can be found on 
the Friends&rsquo; page of the Library&rsquo;s website, at the bottom, or in 
the Teen section. It can also be picked up from the Library circulation desk, 
or from middle school and high school English departments.</p> 
<p>As for the small print, all manuscripts must be typed, double-spaced, in 
12-point type, and no longer than ten pages. There is no fee to enter. All 
three categories may be entered, but no more than one submission per category 
will be accepted, so submit your best work. All work must be original and the 
writer&rsquo;s own. A separate application form is required for each submission 
and please make sure your name does not appear anywhere on the manuscript. 
Please see entry form for the full rules.</p> 
<p><strong>Deadline for entries is Friday, March 30, 2012</strong>, at the 
Library, by the close of the business day, or 2:00 p.m. at the school English 
departments. For more information, read the rules carefully.</p> 
<p>The Friends of the Chappaqua Library look forward to seeing the creative 
talents of the students in the district, and having the opportunity to 
recognize their original artistic efforts.</p> 
<p>The Friends sponsor a wide variety of library programs which enrich our 
amazing community resource. The Friends also purchase books, DVDs, E-books, 
audio materials, even furniture, and of course, sponsor the Young Writers 
Contest. Be sure to attend the Friends&rsquo; upcoming fundraising, a staged 
reading of a new comedy, on March 3, 2012.</p>

<h1>SATURDAY: Celebrate World Happy Day in New Castle</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>See the trailer in &ldquo;Read more&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br>
 
February 10, 2012<br>
<em>by Barbara Kornreich</em></p> 
<p><strong>Saturday, February 11</strong>, 2012 has been declared &ldquo;World 
Happy Day,&rdquo; when screenings of HAPPY, the latest film from Academy ward 
nominated director Roko Belic, will be held around the globe&mdash;including 
here in Chappaqua at the<em><strong>New Castle Community Media Center</strong>
</em>.</p> <br>

<p>The feature length film takes viewers on a journey across five continents 
in search of the keys to happiness.&nbsp; People worldwide will participate in 
the event by watching the film in venues ranging from large public theaters to 
community centers, schools, houses of worship, libraries and private homes.</p> 
<p><br>
 Screenings are scheduled to take place in places as diverse as 
Cambodia, Brazil and Nepal, as well as in cities across the U.S.&nbsp; The 
filmmaker&rsquo;s goal is for people to come together on the same day, to start 
a conversation about what makes people happy and how we might begin to live 
more fulfilling lives.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The film HAPPY was inspired by a challenge.&nbsp; Tom Shadyac, 
producer/director of such films as Bruce Almighty, Liar Liar and Patch Adams, 
read an article in The New York Times that ranked the U.S. 23rd on its list of 
happiest countries.&nbsp; To try to find out why the U.S. ranks so low, he 
asked Belic to travel the world to investigate the origins of human 
happiness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
 The film that resulted is a cinematic quest that takes viewers from 
the bayous of Louisiana to the deserts of Namibia, from the beaches of Brazil 
to the mountains of Bhutan.&nbsp; HAPPY combines real-life human stories 
interspersed with interviews of several of the world&rsquo;s leading experts in 
the science of happiness and well being, to reveal a deeper understanding of 
why and how we can live more fulfilling, happier lives.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
 HAPPY was developed under the Creative Visions Foundation, a 
501(c)(3) organization that supports creative activists who use the power of 
media and the arts to affect positive change in the world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
 The screening will take place at 4:00 pm at New Castle Community 
Media Center, 400 King Street, Suite 1.&nbsp; Admission is free, but because 
space is limited, pre-registration is required. To register, click<strong>HERE

<h1>THIS WEEKEND: Seven Bridges Theatre Company Presents: Seussical, Jr.</h1> 
<p><br>
 Monday, January 30, 2012<br>
<em>by Ellen Davis</em></p> 
<p>The show is cast, rehearsals have started and the excitement builds. On 
February 10-12, the Seven Bridges Theatre Company will present<em><strong>
Seussical Jr.</strong></em>, a show that is perfect entertainment for the whole 
family &ldquo;no matter how small.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<p>Aimee Gautreau, chair of the Seven Bridges Theatre Company, noted that, 
&ldquo;Seussical Jr. brings to life many of Dr. Seuss&rsquo; more memorable 
characters like Horton the Elephant, The Cat in the Hat, Gertrude McFuzz, Lazy 
Bird Mayzie and a little boy with a big imagination named JoJo.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
She added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a delightful experience for both performers and 
audience alike.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Performances are <strong>Friday, February 10 at 7:30 p.m., Saturday, 
February 11 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, February 12 at 2:00 p.m.</strong> All 
tickets are $12 (plus a small transaction fee if purchased online) and are 
available for purchase through the Seven Bridges PTA website:
http://www.chappaquapta.net/SBHome.php </p> 
<p><em><strong>Largest cast in the history of the Seven Bridges PTA Theatre 
Program</strong></em></p> 
<p>All four grades at Seven Bridges are well represented in the cast.&nbsp; In 
fact, with 97 performers, Seussical Jr. has the most participants in the 
history of the Seven Bridges PTA Theater Program.</p> 
<p>For some students, this is the first time they will get to work with the 
professional team assembled by the theater company: Director Kevin Kearins, 
Chorographer Linda Sabatelli-Carelli and Musical Director John Bowen.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always surprised and ecstatic about the quality of dancing and 
singing from the students,&rdquo; commented Director Kevin Kearins. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a treat for the production team to work with such 
talented students.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Eighth grader Megan Warshofsky, Bird Girl Number 1,who loves singing and 
acting &ldquo;has worked with Kevin since her days at Roaring Brook.&rdquo; 
Bird Girl Number 7, Gina Bueti, also an eighth grader pointed out: 
&ldquo;Seussical Jr. starts simply and suddenly the story comes together and 
it&rsquo;s so exciting.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sixth Grader Julia Dalrymple, who portrays 
the Young Kangaroo, is &ldquo;so excited to have a lead part.&rdquo;&nbsp; So 
excited, in fact, that she learned all of her lines before rehearsals even 
started!</p> 
<p>So get ready to join Horton, Mayzie, JoJo, The Cat in the Hat and the 
inhabitants of Whoville for three out-of-this-world performances!</p> 
<p><br>

<h1>NEW:CLOSED: Channel Cupid at the Chappaqua Farmers Market! CLOSED TOMORROW
</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>UPDATE: Fri. 3:00 p.m.Due to the predicted snow, which impacts 
many of our vendors who travel to the market, we will be closed tomorrow. We 
apologize for the inconvenience.&nbsp; Stay safe on the roads and come visit us 
next Saturday Feb 18th.<br>
 February 10, 2012</strong><br>
<em>by Pascale 
LeDraoulec</em></p> 
<p>For Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Big Girl Bakery is bringing some heart-healthy 
treats for your sweetheart like their bittersweet chocolate bark with dried 
cherries and pistachios. They will also be introducing their delicious 
cranberry Merlot sauce which you can drizzle on your favorite Greek yogurt, 
poached pears, or, for something truly decadent, all over their flourless 
chocolate torte cakes (pick one up early &ndash; these sell out quickly!).</p> 
<br> 
<p>Just this Saturday, the market is outdoors on the front lawn of the church. 
(they are setting up for a concert on Saturday evening) So bundle up when you 
come to shop and have a cup of hot coffee or hot chocolate on us.&nbsp; Our 
regular line up of vendors will be there, except for the knife sharpener.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;re back inside next Saturday, Feb 18th.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Is your Valentine not sweet on wheat? Look for Big Girl&rsquo;s rich, dark 
brownies and hearty quinoa oatmeal cookies which are completely wheat free!</p> 
<p>True Food of Nyack also has plenty of gluten-free options, in addition to 
their flavorful (and righteous) burritos and pot pies filled with local meats 
and vegetables and their light yet so satisfying salads like kale and chickpea 
or wheatberry.</p> 
<p>Why not celebrate waking up next to the one you love on Tuesday with some 
wholesome granola at the market? You can find some at the Bread Alone stand, as 
well as at Big Girl Bakery and True Food of Nyack. Try a sample at each and see 
which one you like best.</p> 
<p>In my family, we like to buy each other something red on Valentine&rsquo;s 
Day (I&rsquo;ve gotten a red colander and a red wooly hat in recent years). Red 
meat would totally qualify and we&rsquo;ve got plenty of it at the market this 
week with Roaming Angus paying us a visit. They always have such beautiful 
steaks and this week they are bringing lots for those of you who plan to grill 
for your Valentine.</p> 
<p>A mushroom sauce would go so nicely with that steak &ndash; and you can 
count on Madura to bring a wide variety of culinary mushrooms. The other night, 
my honey made an omelet with Stone Barn eggs and a medley of Madura mushrooms, 
roughly chopped with some parsley and it was do delicious even my 7-year-old 
changed her position on all things fungi.</p> 
<p>A tangy, Pantone-red hot sauce from Guyank Brand would also 
work&hellip;they will be at the market this week so stock up on their various 
flavors of sweet heat&hellip;</p> 
<p>Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day and&hellip;see you at the market!</p>

<h1>NEW: In the garden with Shobha Vanchiswar</h1> 
<p><br>
 More photos in &ldquo;Read more&hellip;&rdquo; and in Photo Gallery
<br> Friday, February 17, 2012</p> 
<p><strong>Go native, reduce lawn area, compost, grow your own vegetables
</strong></p> 
<p>Worrying accomplishes nothing &ndash; my grandmother said that a million 
times. And I&rsquo;ve forgotten that advice just as often. But ever since I 
decided to stop being anxious about the crazy winter and how it might impact my 
garden, I&rsquo;ve been very cognizant of being present in the moment.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp; There is no denying that climate change is a foot. While we&rsquo;ve 
been surprised, okay even a bit uneasy about our unusually mild winter, various 
parts of Europe are experiencing rather severe cold and snow falls. I was in 
India a couple of weeks ago and there too it has been a much colder season. And 
although skeptics might suggest that it is all part of a cyclical pattern seen 
through the millenia, the work of the human hand at this particular time cannot 
be ignored. At no other period in the history of the earth has there been so 
much assorted activity generated by humans. However, I&rsquo;m not here to 
debate this topic. Instead, suffice to say as a gardener, I&rsquo;m deeply 
aware of my close but tenuous relationship with nature. There is a direct 
correlation between how and what I do and the health of the garden. I&rsquo;m 
not going to wring my hands in distress over the obvious change in climate when 
I should be doing what I can to stop it from getting worse. I am ultimately 
only responsible for my own actions. And just maybe I&rsquo;ll set an example 
for others.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Whilst our scientists study and find solutions to the problem at 
large, the rest of us also carry personal responsibility to doing our part in 
maintaining the wellbeing of our planet. There is plenty we can do in the 
various aspects of our lives but I&rsquo;ll stick to what can be achieved in 
the garden.</p> 
<p>First and foremost, go organic. Quit using chemicals and products that 
promise ( and deliver) above average results. Using such things for larger than 
typical blooms, unnaturally pristine lawns, quicker than normal growth 
etc.,&nbsp; are all akin to the use of steroids in athletic sports.<br>
 That 
said, be judicious in using even the organic products. Too much of anything is 
not good.</p> 
<p>Every tree or shrub you plant increases the atmospheric oxygen level. Not 
to mention how the roots prevent soil erosion and the other very positive 
benefits that trees provide in general.</p> 
<p>Go native. Indigenous plants attract indigenous insects that not only carry 
out pollination but also keep pests from proliferating. This balance between 
flora and fauna is critical. Non-native plants do not invite beneficial insects 
because the latter have not evolved to recognize them. Hence, a garden with 
mostly non-native plants will consequently have a bigger problem with pests. 
I&rsquo;m not suggesting anything radical like uprooting all non-native plants. 
Just try to keep a larger number of the natives. Also, plant only non-invasive 
&lsquo;foreigners&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Reduce lawn area. Plant in those super-helpful trees and shrubs! Then, for 
the remaining lawn, use a push reel mower. It provides good exercise and at the 
same time there is no increase in noise or air pollution. Set the mower blade 
at a height of three and a half to four inches. This height of grass keeps the 
soil from drying out quickly and that translates to less watering. Leave grass 
clippings on lawn. They act as a mulch to suppress weeds and quickly break down 
to enrich the soil. Fertilize the lawn with compost only. Compost is in 
addition, a great weed suppressant. Ultimately, the benefits will also be felt 
in the pocket book.</p> 
<p>Add bird feeders, bird and bat houses and such to make your garden 
&lsquo;user friendly&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Start composting. Don&rsquo;t make any more excuses. Vegetable and fruit 
peelings and scraps, egg shells and torn up paper cartons, coffee grinds and 
tea bags, and garden waste all produce the finest food for the plants. 
Composting is not difficult or time consuming. Its been done for centuries all 
over the world. It is inexpensive and reduces the amount of garbage you put out 
for collection. So what are you waiting for?</p> 
<p>Leaves collected in the fall can be composted and thus saves the bother of 
bagging them for pick-up. Chopped up leaves also make good mulch in the garden 
beds.</p> 
<p>Set up a rain barrel to collect rain water from a down spout. Use this free 
water to feed thirsty plants. There is some concern about the quality of this 
water as it runs over asphalt roof shingles so don&rsquo;t use it for the 
vegetable garden. But it is perfectly safe everywhere else. Water used to boil 
eggs and vegetables can also be used in the garden.</p> 
<p>Growing your own vegetables and fruit is so healthy and wholesome. And so 
low on the carbon footprint index!</p> 
<p>Clippings and limbs from pruning of trees make good kindling and firewood 
when dried for a while. Wood ash from the fireplace can be applied anywhere the 
soil needs &lsquo;sweetening&rsquo; that is, where the acidity must be reduced. 
Some clippings can also be used to stake floppy plants.</p> 
<p>Banish peat from the garden. Peat harvesting has a huge adverse impact on 
wildlife and the environment. So be eco-aware of such matters. Good 
alternatives such as your own homemade compost exist.</p> 
<p>Having been practicing all of the above for some years now,&nbsp; in no way 
makes me smug. There is always more to do. But, the indulgence from such 
efforts surely permits a clearer conscience and a special joy in living in the 
moment.</p>

<h1>In the garden with Shobha Vanchiswar</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 10, 2012</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stop fretting. All the way up to now, I&rsquo;ve been 
carrying around a sense of foreboding. How my plants&mdash;the bulbs in 
particular&mdash;will be affected has been my dilemma.</p> <br>

<p>In truth, I&rsquo;ve allowed myself to be plagued by worry. So whilst 
others around me were waxing eloquent about the balmy weather in the middle of 
what ought to be freezing days, I went about my business glum and concerned.</p>
<p>Lack of snow implied there was nothing coddling the plants. Higher than 
normal temperatures meant their vital winter slumber was disturbed. The cheery 
yellow of forsythia flowers usually recognized as a sign that spring had 
arrived were now spied in January. Only now they seemed as though they were 
danger flags flapping about in warning. The green of daffodil leaves spearing 
through the earth are one of my favorite sights but not I discovered if its 
happening by end of December.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s my garden Open Day in 
May and at this rate I&rsquo;m not sure what will be in bloom and how it might 
look. Things are just too topsy-turvy for my liking. So unsettling.</p> 
<p>But yesterday, as I went for a walk, I found myself enjoying the ease with 
which I was able to walk a distance simply because the weather was so 
comfortable. When typically the bitingly cold wind and icy roads would have me 
hurrying to get back home, here I was not in any rush to end the walk. It felt 
great.</p> 
<p>So I got to thinking that instead of taking things as they were, I had been 
so focused on wanting things as they ought to be. I had no control over the 
weather and yet, I was behaving as though I did. I was simply not in the moment 
and I didn&rsquo;t like how it made me feel. There and then, with a big 
exhalation, I let go of my worries over the garden. Accepting that 
there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about this crazy winter has freed me to enjoy 
the mild temperatures. What will be will be.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m now joyously embracing the gentle winter. Not having to shovel 
snow as often as we did last year is a relief. To be dressed in lighter jackets 
and shoes is positively delightful. And I certainly don&rsquo;t miss dodging 
the dagger like icicles that threaten to impale all who pass under the edge of 
the roof. This past Sunday, I delighted in being able to work outdoors as I 
potted up the bulbs I&rsquo;d been cooling.</p> 
<p>Well, what about the garden and the precious plants? I simply don&rsquo;t 
know but I cannot worry. Its not that I&rsquo;ve stopped caring; I&rsquo;ve 
just given myself permission to stop feeling I&rsquo;m responsible for the 
consequences. Instead, I&rsquo;m seeing this as an adventure and I just know 
there&rsquo;ll be lessons to be learned come spring. Will I feel awful if my 
bulbs fail to put up the expected show? Absolutely. However, I&rsquo;m certain 
if that should happen, there&rsquo;ll be other delights to compensate. Life is 
like that after all, setbacks and surprises are all part of it. Thus the garden 
continues to inform and instruct me on how to cope to the best of my ability. 
Nothing less, nothing more.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, 
taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each.&rdquo;<br>

<h1>Living with coyotes&mdash;co-existing strategies</h1> 
<p><br>
 Monday, February 13, 2012<br>
<em>by Stephen Coleman, New Castle 
Environmental Coordinator</em></p> 
<p>Coyotes are an important part of a healthy ecosystem and in our area serve 
as one of the top predators in the food chain.&nbsp; They help maintain the 
health of our environment by controlling rodents, woodchucks, insects and other 
prolific animals and serve as one of nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;clean-up 
services&rdquo; by removing dead animals and preventing disease.</p> <br>

<p>Many other scavenger animals such as foxes, crows and hawks, benefit from 
coyote predation on other animals through increased food availability.&nbsp; 
People benefit by catching glimpses of this majestic animal or listening to 
their amazing vocal display.<br>
<br>
<strong>Myths About Coyotes</strong></p> 
<p>TRUTH&mdash;Statistically, coyotes are not a significant threat to your 
safety.&nbsp; Lightning, cows and deer pose a greater risk, but acting 
responsibly is always the key to safety.<br>
<br>
 TRUTH&mdash;You may see a 
coyote in the daytime.&nbsp; Coyotes can be very active during the daytime, 
don&rsquo;t assume they have rabies or are sick.&nbsp; Most common sightings 
are early morning and evenings.<br>
<br>
 TRUTH&mdash;Coyotes are not a 
significant predator of pets and deer.&nbsp; While coyotes may occasionally 
take free roaming domestic animals and deer, diet studies confirm that rodents, 
rabbits, insects, fruit and carrion make up the bulk of their diet.<br>
<br>

<strong>PREVENTING CONFLICTS WITH COYOTES&mdash;11 EASY TIPS</strong></p> 
<p>Here are a few suggestions to make your property less attractive to coyotes.
</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let coyotes intimidate you!&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t hesitate to scare or threaten coyotes with loud noises and bright 
lights. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to pick up small objects, such as a tennis ball, 
and throw them at the coyote. If a water hose is close at hand, spray the 
coyote with water in the face. Let the coyote know it is unwelcome in your 
area.&nbsp; Carry a whistle, shout at them, coyotes do not like loud or sudden 
movements.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t run, but slowly walk away (instinctively, 
coyotes&mdash;and pet dogs&mdash;will follow after anything that runs, 
including a person), make yourself look bigger by putting your arms over your 
head or opening your jacket.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secure your garbage!&nbsp; Coyotes will raid 
open trash materials and compost piles. Secure your garbage in tough plastic 
containers with tight fitting lids and keep in secure buildings when possible. 
Take out trash the morning pick up is scheduled, not the previous night. Keep 
compost piles in containers designed to contain but vent the material.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t feed or try to pet coyotes!&nbsp; Keep 
wild things wild!&nbsp; Feeding, whether direct or indirect, can cause coyotes 
to act tame and over time may lead to bold behavior. Coyotes that rely on 
natural food items remain wild and wary of humans.<br>
</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep your pets safe!&nbsp; Although free roaming 
pets are more likely to be killed by automobiles than by wild animals, coyotes 
do view cats and small dogs as easy prey and are at risk year round.&nbsp; 
Conflicts between dogs and coyotes occur primarily in the months of March and 
April when coyotes are setting up territories for raising of their young.&nbsp; 
The outcome of a confrontation between a small dog and a coyote depends upon 
the dogs behavior.&nbsp; A coyote due to its size will expect the small dog to 
be submissive.&nbsp; If the small dog does not submit, it could result in the 
dog eventually being killed.&nbsp; Medium and large sized dogs usually have 
little to worry about because they are of similar or larger size than the 
coyote.&nbsp; If confrontations occur it will be over territory and coyotes 
will usually yield yard areas to the dogs.&nbsp; In general, for the safety of 
your pets, it is best to keep them restrained at all times.</p> 
<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Feed pets indoors!&nbsp; Outdoor feeding 
attracts many wild animals to your door!</p> 
<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep bird feeding areas clean!&nbsp; Use 
feeders designed to keep seed off the ground as the seed attracts many small 
mammals that coyotes prey upon. Remove feeders if coyotes are regularly seen 
around your yard.</p> 
<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Close off crawl spaces under porches and 
sheds!&nbsp; Coyotes will often use crawl spaces for resting and raising 
young.&nbsp; Properly installed fencing will deter coyotes from entering these 
areas.&nbsp; Coyotes are excellent diggers, so fencing may need to extend into 
the ground.</p> 
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cut back brushy edges in your yard!&nbsp; 
These areas provide cover for coyotes and their prey.</p> 
<p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protect your vegetable garden and 
produce!&nbsp; Clear fallen fruit from around fruit trees and rotted vegetable 
from your garden</p> 
<p>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Install perimeter fencing and exterior motion 
sensor lighting around yard areas!&nbsp; Coyotes normally will not scale fences 
unless they have a specific reason.&nbsp; A height of 6 feet is 
recommended.&nbsp; Coyotes are excellent diggers, so fencing may need to extend 
into the ground.&nbsp; Motion sensor lights at the edges of the property will 
also help distract coyotes<br>
<br>
 11.&nbsp; Educate your neighbors!&nbsp; 
Pass this information along since your efforts will be futile if neighbors are 
providing food or shelter for coyotes.<br>
<br>
 Resolving Conflicts with 
Coyotes<br>
<br>
 There are 3 main options for resolving conflicts with 
coyotes: exercising tolerance, fencing and good housekeeping practices, and 
lethal removal.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tolerance&mdash;Most conflicts with coyotes can be resolved 
by implementing some of the preventative tips noted above.&nbsp; Coyotes, as 
well as other wildlife, are continuously adapting to living with people and are 
opportunistic in finding foods and resources that are available.&nbsp; Living 
with wildlife requires that people be pro-active rather than re-active, in 
dealing with wildlife situations in their neighborhoods.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fencing and other good housekeeping 
practices&mdash;also see above preventative tips.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Removing Coyotes&mdash;Coyotes are legally protected 
by New York State and Federal Regulations and there are specific procedures on 
how and when a coyote can be removed.&nbsp; A coyote may not be removed simply 
because of its presence in an area, there must be damage or a threat to human 
safety by a specific animal.<br>
<br>
 Coyotes are naturally afraid of people 
and their presence alone is not a cause for concern.&nbsp; If coyotes have 
direct access to human food, they can become habituated and may become more 
aggressive around people.&nbsp; Coyote behaviors that may indicate that the 
coyote has lost its fear of people are:<br>
<br>
 1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a 
coyote does not run off when harassed or chased;<br>
 2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a 
coyote approaches pets on a leash, and/or<br>
 3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
approaches and follows people.<br>
<br>
 When you see any of the above 
behaviors, please notify the New York State Department of Environmental 
Conservation (NYSDEC).&nbsp; Phone 845-256-3012, Environmental Conservation 
Office.&nbsp; NYSDEC is the authority concerning wildlife safety issues.&nbsp; 
Please note,&nbsp; &nbsp; coyotes taking pets are not considered an immediate 
threat to human safety, therefore, the police department is not authorized to 
remove these wild animals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Natural History of Coyotes</strong>
</p> 
<p>The eastern coyote moved back into New York in the 1950&rsquo;s and has 
become firmly established and an integral part of our ecosystem.&nbsp; The 
coyote is a native to North America and have been a part of New Castle&rsquo;s 
landscape for decades.&nbsp; Coyotes are a medium sized predator, an 
opportunistic feeder and extremely adaptable to a wide range of habitats, 
quickly adjusting to changes in the landscape and are now found in all areas of 
the Town and region.</p> 
<p><strong>What do coyotes look like?</strong></p> 
<p>Coyotes are the size of a medium-size dog (4-5 feet in length), but with 
longer, thicker fur.&nbsp; They often can have a German Shepard-like 
appearance.&nbsp; Coyotes have a long, bushy, black-tipped tail that is usually 
carried pointing down.&nbsp; They have large erect ears, weigh between 35-50 
pounds.&nbsp; The color of the fur can range from reddish-yellow or tan to gray 
or black.&nbsp; They have a patch of white fur around the lower jaw and 
neck.&nbsp; Because of their thick fur, they often appear heavier than they 
really are.&nbsp; They also can be confused with red and gray foxes who have 
similar coat colorations.</p> 
<p><strong>Life History</strong></p> 
<p>An adult male and female will actively maintain a territory that may vary 
in size from 2 to 30 square miles.&nbsp; Breeding season is in February with 
4-8 pups born in a den in April/May.&nbsp; Coyotes are very social and will 
maintain family groups of pups until young adults disperse on their own in late 
fall.</p> 
<p><strong>Habits</strong></p> 
<p>Coyotes are typically shy and elusive, but can frequently be seen 
individually, in pairs or in small groups where food is commonly found.&nbsp; 
They communicate with each other by vocalizing, and scent marking of 
trails.&nbsp; They can be heard howling and yipping at night, or even during 
the day in response to sirens and other loud noises.&nbsp; Coyotes are active 
year-round and do not hibernate.</p> 
<p><strong>Food</strong></p> 
<p>Coyotes are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will feed on whatever is 
most readily available and easy to obtain.&nbsp; Their primary foods include 
small rodents, rabbits, birds, deer, insects, frogs and snakes, and fruit and 
berries. They will scavenge on road kills, garbage and pet food containers left 
outdoors.&nbsp; They are known to prey upon unprotected pets, including cats 
and small dogs.<br>

<h1>Merchant of the Week: The King&rsquo;s Scribe on Lower King, of course</h1>
<p><br>
<em>Allisa Harvey, The King&rsquo;s Scribe</em><br>
<em>Photos by 
Kevan Full, atkevanslens.com; see more in Photo Gallery</em><br>
 February 3, 
2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>With Valentine&rsquo;s Day approaching, I dropped in to The King&rsquo;s 
Scribe to see how to score some points with my wife.</p> <br>

<p><strong>How long has your store been a member of our community?</strong>
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My store, The King&rsquo;s Scribe opened on May 1,&nbsp; 2011.&nbsp; Retail 
is a new endeavor for me, but I have been a graphic designer and illustrator 
with an online stationery design business since about 2008.</p> 
<p><strong>Besides Valentine&rsquo;s day, which is right around the corner, 
what are you other busy times of year?</strong></p> 
<p>Mother&rsquo;s Day was a fantastic time to have a grand opening, and 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to another busy Mother&rsquo;s Day coming up.&nbsp; 
The holiday season starts for me with custom photo cards and holiday greetings 
in October.&nbsp; Though I expected a bit of a lull after December, I&rsquo;m 
actually busier than ever with wedding invitations and bar and bat mitzvahs. 
There are so many newly engaged couples around the holidays who begin their 
wedding planning in the new year!</p> 
<p><strong>I know you sell specialty papers and envelopes, is it tough to 
compete in this computer age?</strong> </p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to think of &ldquo;competing&rdquo; with the digital 
age.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really conscious of the fact that people communicate in a 
different way now, and it&rsquo;s important for me to keep up with that.&nbsp; 
So I do carry things like iPhone and iPad covers. But my passion is just trying 
to remind people of the impression that hand-written correspondence still 
makes, and remind people that certain sentiments just can&rsquo;t be expressed 
with a text message or email.&nbsp; Words on paper represents time spent, in a 
sincere way to make a statement.</p> 
<p><strong>I also know you sell all sorts of invitations -&nbsp; wedding, 
birth announcements, holiday cards, bar/bat mitzvah, graduation, corporate and 
birthday parties, baby shower&mdash;do you have nightmares about eVite?</strong>
</p> 
<p>It does break my heart a little (ok, a lot) when people tell me they are 
going to send an eVite for their kid&rsquo;s Bar Mitzvah.&nbsp; What I remind 
people of in reference to the invitation is that this is the preview of the 
event to come.&nbsp; It needs to make a statement&mdash;now, that doesn&rsquo;t 
mean it needs to be frivolous and expensive.&nbsp; But it should be 
thoughtfully designed, especially considering the importance of such an event 
as a Bar Mitzvah or special anniversary.</p> 
<p><strong>I know your web site http://www.kingsscribe.com is near 
completion.&nbsp; What type of services will you offer on your site?</strong>
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping its done within the next week or so!&nbsp; There will be 
capability to shop online and I will ship globally.<br>
 I offer shipping 
services via UPS at a rate below standard retail and I will pack and ship your 
packages anywhere.</p> 
<p><strong>Is your main customer base the creative community?&nbsp; </strong>
</p> 
<p>Not necessarily, but I do really get the warm fuzzies when a customer walks 
in and says they are a total &ldquo;paper person&rdquo; and they really GET 
what I&rsquo;m trying to do here!&nbsp; I sell greeting cards for all occasions 
which gets people in the door on a regular basis</p> 
<p><strong>What would you recommend to make our downtown hamlets more 
vibrant?&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>As merchants in a small community I think we all have the same 
hope&mdash;that people will appreciate the contribution that our businesses 
make in their town, and consciously commit to supporting us, because it<em>does
</em> go back into our community via donations, events and other outreach.</p> 
<p><strong>Any special discounts for <em>NewCastleNOW</em> readers who mention 
this article?</strong>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Sure.&nbsp; With orders of 150 or more Bar Mitzvah invitation suites I will 
give free digital calligraphy on the guest&rsquo;s envelopes.<br>

<h1>Board of Ed approves plan expanded by Turf Committee to $3 million</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 3, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>The Chappaqua Turf Committee (TCTC) has plans to expand its original $2 
million fundraising campaign for turf installation on the Greeley Competition 
Field to include another $1 million for improvements and additions to the 
surrounding area.&nbsp; On Tuesday, board of education members voted to accept 
up to $3 million in private donations TCTC intends to raise.&nbsp; At the same 
time, the board amended its contract with The WBA Group to include the 
additional design and engineering services&mdash;all contingent upon receiving 
the funds from the TCTC.</p> <br>

<p>Installation of the turf by fall of 2012 remains TCTC&rsquo;s priority, but 
additional restrooms, walkways, improvement to the concession stand, the track, 
and tennis courts are now in the committees sights as well.&nbsp; TCTC 
currently has around a half-million in donations and pledges.</p> 
<p>In its application to the NYS Education Department for the required 
approvals for the fields project, the board will include needed roof repairs to 
the Greeley gym.&nbsp; By doing so, the entire $3 million project&mdash;turf 
field and roof repair&mdash;qualifies for state aid of around 30% of the cost, 
resulting in $900,000 back to the school district, spread out over 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>The Chappaqua Turf Committee&rsquo;s Expanded Plans</strong><br>

<em>Additonal fees (not shown) are associated with each</em></p> 
<p>&bull; reconstruct the running track&mdash;$380,000</p> 
<p>&bull; replace tennis court lights (with same as on football field, 
directed downward)&mdash;$110,000</p> 
<p>&bull; resurface the tennis courts&mdash;$30,000</p> 
<p>&bull; concession stand, mechanical room, restrooms&mdash;$40,000</p> 
<p>&bull; entrance plaza and walkway to the field&mdash;$210,000</p>

<h1>Tim Bloom to attend LWV &ldquo;Students Inside Albany&rdquo; Conference
</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 3, 2012<br>
<em>by Sheila Bernson and Jennifer Mebes Flagg
</em></p> 
<p>Tim Bloom, an 11th grade student at Horace Greeley High School, has been 
chosen by the League of Women Voters of New Castle to attend this year&rsquo;s 
Students Inside Albany Conference, organized by the League of Women Voters of 
New York State.</p> <br>

<p>This twelfth annual Students Inside Albany Conference will take place from 
March 25-28, 2012, and will bring together approximately 40 students from 
across the state to Albany to get a first-hand education about their state 
government. The program is designed to increase high school students&rsquo; 
knowledge about the process by which public policy is proposed and enacted, and 
awareness of their responsibility in representative government. The four-day 
conference provides students with the information, motivation, and skills to 
become informed voters and engaged citizens.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While at the conference, students will join their peers in a hands-on 
learning experience about how state government works.&nbsp; Students will 
participate in a series of interactive lectures on topics such as the state 
budget process, the role of lobbyists in the legislative process, citizen 
rights to access government information, the role of media in politics, and the 
move to reform state government.&nbsp; The students will have an opportunity to 
tour the state&rsquo;s Capitol. The highlight for most students will be the 
opportunity to shadow their Senators and their Assembly member for an 
afternoon, with many students getting the opportunity to attend session on the 
Chamber floor.</p> 
<p>For more information on the program please send an email to Lea Barth at

<h1>Super Food for the Super Bowl at the Chappaqua Farmers Market!</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 3, 2012<br>
<em>by Pascale LeDraoulec</em></p> 
<p>Our &ldquo;local&rdquo; team is going to the Superbowl. This Sunday, make 
your<em>party spread</em> local, too!&nbsp; Come get everything you need for 
your game-watching party at the Farmers Market this Saturday: pickles, hummus, 
organic sausages, delicate veal pastrami, artisanal cheeses, and lots of 
organic, locally farmed meats from both Stone Barns and Gaia&rsquo;s Breath for 
chilis and stews.&nbsp; The market runs from 9:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Saturdays 
at St. Mary&rsquo;s next to Bell.</p> <br>

<p>Too busy to make soup or chili? We&rsquo;ll forgive if you head to <strong>
Fork &amp; Glass</strong> for some of their crowd-pleasing soups. This week, 
they&rsquo;ve got two new soups:<em>Sweet Potato with Rosemary</em> <em>and 
Local Maple Syrup</em> as well as <em>Mediterranean Chickpea with Sundried 
Tomatoes and Kale</em>. For the first time this week, Sunny and Mark will be 
preparing their popular pork tacos at the market with pork from Stone Barns.</p>
<p>You can take some of their packaged <em>chicken and cheese enchiladas</em> 
home along with some &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; beans (pinto beans slow-cooked with 
roasted onions, tomatoes and jalapenos and finished with cilantro and lime.) 
For those of you who are trying to eat lighter, their<em>Moroccan barley salad
</em> made dried cranberries, almonds and tangarine zest is as sensible as it 
is sublime.</p> 
<p>In addition to their popular hummus, <strong>Taiim</strong> is now selling 
packages of their delicious house falafel that you can either bake or fry up at 
home. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be an interesting departure from chicken wings on 
Sunday?</p> 
<p><strong>True Food of Nyack </strong>will be serving up their retro pot pies 
filled with all things local and healthy.</p> 
<p><strong>Flour City Pasta</strong> is back this week!&nbsp; This 
small-batch, organic pasta is intensely flavorful so you really can go light on 
the sauce. Tomorrow they will be unveiling a new pasta:<em>Pizza Blend</em> - 
shaped like a fresh baked pizza!</p> 
<p>Also tomorrow, <strong>Buddhapesto</strong> is back with that wickedly good 
pesto sauce and<strong>Bombay Emerald Company</strong> is visiting us with a 
decidedly different &ldquo;green sauce&rdquo; which is no less delicious: try 
their mint chutney on some local lamb! Also: they sell healthy samosas that are 
ready to bake and serve.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to buy olives and organic <strong>Tierra Farm</strong> 
nuts!</p> 
<p>Of course, all of the above would work just as well for those (like me) who 
will be settling into another episode of Downton Abbey instead of watching 
football&hellip;</p> 
<p>See you at the market!</p>

<h1>Summer at Wagon Road Camp, a mini-world of diversity in the heart of New 
Castle</h1> 
<p><br>
 Monday, January 30, 2012<br>
<em>by Vince Canziani</em></p> 
<p>One way to help the children of today succeed in the world of tomorrow is 
to give them experiences of diversity when they are young. Summer camp is one 
of the best ways to do this, and Wagon Road&rsquo;s Summer Day Camp, located on 
Quaker Road, does it right here in Chappaqua.</p> <br>

<p>As the world grows closer together, people who are open to others with 
different backgrounds will have an advantage in developing relationships in 
school, at work, and in society in general.</p> 
<p>In my 11 years of running our Summer Camp at Wagon Road for The 
Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, I have witnessed the joy of friendships created 
as the children play and grow together. Summer camp is a powerful experience 
that helps a child grow and mature in remarkable ways. When a summer camp 
includes ethnic and economic diversity, the children learn not only about the 
greater world around them, but also about the accessibility of that world 
through relationships with others, here and now.</p> 
<p>The Wagon Road Summer Day Camp brings together children ages 6-13 from 
diverse communities in Westchester, Manhattan and the Bronx to play sports, 
ride horses, garden, dance, cook, act and swim&mdash;all the while building 
understanding and sensitivity that children might not otherwise have.</p> 
<p>If you are a parent exploring summer experiences for your children and wish 
to consider including diversity in your plans, here are some things to consider 
about Wagon Road:</p> 
<p>1. We bring the children together in groups of 12 separated by gender and 
balanced for different ethnic backgrounds so that no camper ever feels 
isolated. This size group, supervised by two counselors, allows for lots of 
opportunities for relationships to build through shared activities.</p> 
<p>2. Our staff training includes specific games to help build relationships 
among the children and encourage new friendships. In addition, the staff 
reflects the diversity of the children, and model positive relationships among 
a diverse group of people.</p> 
<p>The administration of the camp is made up of highly skilled social service 
and educational professionals, each of whom has at least 20 years of experience 
with children. All have worked with diverse populations in their careers, and 
all provide expert guidance for the children and the staff to insure a 
successful camp.</p> 
<p>The positive atmosphere, the fun and exciting activities, and the group 
camaraderie of summer camp help children make friends and enjoy time 
together.&nbsp; Children of different backgrounds learn very quickly to look 
beyond the visible and social differences and see the person, the friend, 
standing next to them.</p> 
<p><em>Vince Canziani, LMSW, is the Director of Wagon Road Camp which is owned 
and operated by The Children&rsquo;s Aid Society in Chappaqua, a non-for profit 
organization. For more information call 914-238-4761 or visit

<h1>NEW: Too many magazines for an elderly parent?</h1> 
<p>Tuesday, January 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Nancy King</em></p> 
<p>On a recent visit to my eighty-six year old mother&rsquo;s residence, she 
pointed out a pile of magazines (Shape, US Weekly, Country Living and W) and 
complained that she had not subscribed to and didn&rsquo;t want.&nbsp; I 
volunteered to make the calls to ensure that she was unsubscribed and not 
billed.</p> <br>

<p>Although I discovered the magazines were promotional and my mother was not 
expected to pay for them, they were still unwanted.&nbsp; Simply throwing them 
away was a chore for my mother and, as a child of the depression; the waste of 
throwing out a perfectly good magazine was difficult.&nbsp; This waste is 
further compounded environmentally by the materials and energy consumed in 
production and shipment.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Canceling proved to be an exercise in patience. When I called the number 
listed in the magazine for subscriptions, I was informed that the subscriptions 
were ordered through a publisher clearing house or magazine subscription 
service.&nbsp; (My mother did not recall ordering them.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Several magazines did not list a telephone number, only a website.&nbsp; 
The unsubscribe page was simple and easy to use, but ineffective because the 
magazines were not ordered through the regular subscription process.&nbsp; I 
had to contact a subscription service and then call customer service to get the 
name and number of the subscription service.&nbsp; The name and number I was 
most frequently given was that of National Publishers Exchange.&nbsp; The agent 
at National Publishers Exchange stated that subscriptions are processed by 
their company but I would need to contact the subscription service 
directly.&nbsp; American Preferred Readers, Publishers Clearing House, Direct 
Reader Services are a few of the companies with whom I spoke.&nbsp; Many times 
they referred me back to the publisher or to National Publishers 
Exchange.&nbsp; I quickly learned to expect extended (often in excess of 
fifteen minutes) hold times.&nbsp; After many hours of doggedly calling and 
calling again, I think all were canceled (but we can expect 3-4 more issues 
before they actually stop coming).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Several years ago, my neighbor helped her elderly aunt move to a nursing 
home.&nbsp; She was shocked by the number of magazines in her aunt&rsquo;s 
house.&nbsp; This, combined with my experience with my mother, leads me to 
suspect the subscription service companies target elderly to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; 
subscriptions in order to increase circulation.&nbsp; I understand that 
magazines are under siege due to changes in electronic media, but these 
practices to increase circulation are onerous almost to the point of being 
predatory when it comes to senior citizens.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The telephone process was confusing and difficult for me &ndash; it would 
have been impossible for my mother.&nbsp; Even starting the cancellation 
process could be challenging to a senior citizen in that:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp; * The masthead is sometimes buried several pages into the magazine
<br> &nbsp; * The subscriber customer service information is in a tiny font<br>

 &nbsp; * Several publications do not list a telephone number&hellip;only 
website info.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>What is to be done?&nbsp; I plan to write to all these publications as well 
as to my state and federal representatives enclosing a copy of this 
letter.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my hope that they will take action to investigate the 
practices of the magazine subscriber service industry and take action to ensure 
that their publications are sent only to readers who want to receive them.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;Temporary Shelter,&rdquo; An Art Installation about Homeless New 
Yorkers</h1> 
<p><br>
 February 3, 2012<br>
<em>by Rachel Rosin</em><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
 
Fiber Artist Heather G. Stoltz tells the stories of homeless men, women and 
children through her installation piece Temporary Shelter. The art piece, which 
takes the shape of a sukkah (free-standing hut), will travel to Temple Beth El 
of Northern Westchester starting today, February 3.</p> <br>

<p>Stoltz&rsquo;s piece will remain on display at Temple Beth El through 
February 17, and<strong>Stoltz will be speaking at 9:45 AM on Sunday, February 5
</strong> to share the stories she heard and the process leading to the piece. 
She will also be available after the 7:15 PM Shabbat service on Friday, 
February 3 to answer any questions people may have.</p> 
<p>For the last two years, Stoltz has been interviewing men and women in New 
York&rsquo;s faith-based homeless shelters and translating their stories into 
visual fiber art panels that make up the interior walls of the structure. The 
outside walls are made up of over 100 small fiber art pieces made by children 
in the city&rsquo;s family shelters. Stoltz visited nine family shelters and 
helped the students create art which expresses their feelings about living in a 
shelter. Represented in the piece are the stories of homeless New Yorkers ages 
4 to 75.</p> 
<p>Stoltz, who worked as the Community Service Coordinator for Stephen Wise 
Free Synagogue, spent time speaking with the ten men who stayed in the 
synagogue&rsquo;s faith-based shelter five nights a week. After listening to 
the wide variety of backgrounds and life situations which led them to the 
shelter, Stoltz decided to tell their stories through her art. Also inspired by 
Jewish sources, Stoltz decided to use the traditional Jewish symbol of a sukkah 
as the vehicle for the art. The sukkah, a temporary hut that reminds Jews of 
the years they spent wandering the desert, seemed like a fitting symbol for a 
piece about New York&rsquo;s homeless. In addition, by displaying the struggles 
and triumphs of these homeless individuals on the walls, the ushpizin (exalted 
guests) invited into the space will be the homeless men, women, and children of 
our city instead of the traditional Biblical ancestors.</p> 
<p>Since the large population of men, women and children who are homeless is a 
difficult number to grasp, Stoltz hopes that those who view her piece will see 
that statistics are made up of individuals each with his or her own personal 
journey. Temporary Shelter is made possible in part with public funds from the 
Manhattan Community Arts Fund, supported by the New York City Department of 
Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and administered by Lower 
Manhattan Cultural Council.</p>

<h1>Fundraiser at Beth El raises $353,000 for The Cottage School</h1> 
<p> <br>
 February 3, 2012<br>
<em>by Marci Garson</em></p> 
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note:</em> The non-profit Jewish Child Care 
Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Tree Grows in Pleasantville&rdquo; benefit raises 
much-needed funds, as well as hope, for neglected children who live and study at
<em>The Cottage School</em> in Pleasantville.&nbsp; Gathered for a fundraiser 
in Temple Beth El&rsquo;s in social hall on January 7, supporters of the school 
heard children themselves tell their heartbreaking stories.&nbsp; Marci 
Garson&rsquo;s report of the evening follows.</p> <br>

<p>Before *Sabrina could get up the nerve to tell her life&rsquo;s story at 
Saturday night&rsquo;s fundraiser for the Pleasantville Cottage Schools, she 
hid in the ladies room. Finally, a few JCCA members tracked her down and 
managed to calm her fears.&nbsp; No wonder Sabrina was anxious; she was about 
to tell a horror story of abuse and sexual molestation that began when she was 
just 6 years old.</p> 
<p><br>
 The room was silent as Sabrina explained how she ended up at The 
Cottage Schools, a safe haven for abused and neglected children.&nbsp; Many 
wiped away tears as she stood before the well-heeled crowd gathered in Temple 
Beth-El&rsquo;s brand new social hall and bravely recounted how her stepfather 
took advantage of her, her mother refused to believe her, how she turned to 
drugs, and worse, to &ldquo;make the pain go away&hellip; I had what I would 
call an emotional breakdown.&nbsp; I started to cut myself which caused 
hospitalization four times in three months.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
 The image these words conjured up was in sharp contrast to the 
Temple&rsquo;s stunning room decorated with an enormous sparkling white tree as 
its centerpiece. But just as the tree represents new growth, Sabrina attributes 
her new life to The Cottage Schools. Now a senior in high school, she has 
already been accepted to college and hopes one day to write a book about her 
life &ldquo;so that other kids like me won&rsquo;t feel so alone.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
 It takes a village</p> 
<p>Sabrina was far from alone Saturday night.&nbsp; Hundreds of people 
attended the annual &ldquo;Tree&rdquo; event this year helping to raise 
$353,000.&nbsp; All of the money will go directly into the services that 
protect the residential programs at The Cottage Schools.</p> 
<p>In celebration of the Campus&rsquo; 100th anniversary the non- profit JCCA 
also launched &ldquo;Paving the Way: The Cottage Schools Brick Campaign&rdquo; 
at the &ldquo;Tree&rdquo; event.&nbsp; It is a yearlong campaign during which 
bricks can be purchased for $100 and $200, and a tree can be bought for $5,000. 
The money will be used to create a special family visiting area where a 
tree-lined brick pathway will lead to a serene park-like setting separate from 
the rest of the Campus. Saturday night the JCCA sold 100 bricks and one tree, a 
great beginning for this new project.</p> 
<p><br>
 *Tahitia, another teen who mustered up the courage to speak Saturday 
night, expressed sadness over not knowing whether she and her mother will ever 
be &ldquo;family&rdquo; again because &ldquo;I was tired of being screamed at, 
cursed at and hit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still, she admitted that by age 10 she had 
started smoking and drinking in order to fit in with the other kids in her 
rough Bronx neighborhood. After being late to school 106 days and being 
suspended 6 times in one year, Tahitia was sent to the Diagnostic Program in 
Pleasantville where she claims her social worker &ldquo;really helped me to 
loosen up&rdquo; and credits her therapist with teaching her to &ldquo;get out 
my anger and work through some uncomfortable feelings.&nbsp; Most of those 
uncomfortable feelings,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;are being judged for my 
sexuality&hellip;I accept, understand and am proud that I am a lesbian.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p><br>
 Tahitia feels that owning who she is has helped her to take advantage 
of the many programs the Campus offer. She joined the basketball team, and got 
involved with the therapeutic arts program.&nbsp; Tahitia also takes poetry, 
guitar and African drumming (one of her favorites, she explains, because, 
&ldquo; I got to beat up on something that wasn&rsquo;t a person&rdquo;).&nbsp; 
Tahitia also enjoys a therapeutic horsemanship program where she works closely 
with a horse named Melos whom she gently lulls to sleep as she grooms him.</p> 
<p><br>
 None of these programs would be possible without events like the 
&ldquo;Tree&rdquo; fundraiser and volunteers like Lisa Golomb, who taught a 
photography class that Tahitia enrolled in and is now the teen&rsquo;s mentor. 
&ldquo;She emotionally supports me,&rdquo; Tahitia stresses, &ldquo;and makes 
me have confidence in myself&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds 
for me, but I&rsquo;m thankful that JCCA helped me get where I am 
today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>*Sabrina and Tahitia are not the girls&rsquo; real names, but their stories 
are true and representative of the more than 320 inner city kids who live and 
go to school at The Cottage Schools until social workers can either reunite 
them with their families or find them foster homes.</p>

<h1>In the garden with Shobha Vanchiswar</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Snowdrops, still enjoying a fabulous run this so-called 
&ldquo;winter&rdquo;</em><br>
 February 3, 2012</p> 
<p><strong>Things to Do in February</strong></p> <br>

<p>1. If you put away bulbs for cooling in late fall, check the dates and 
start the process of forcing them. Hyacinths like about fourteen weeks of 
cooling. Tulips require a couple of weeks longer.</p> 
<p>2. Continue caring for houseplants. Check for disease, water regularly, 
fertilize occasionally, provide adequate light, humidity and warmth.</p> 
<p>3. Since the season has been relatively snow-free, use this as an 
opportunity to keep tidying the garden by picking up fallen twigs and such.</p> 
<p>4. Be careful to not walk too much on lawn areas. The grass is still 
vulnerable.</p> 
<p>5. Check to see if anything needs retying or repairing. If possible, take 
care of matters right away.</p> 
<p>6. If you already have things blooming in the garden, just bring the 
flowers indoors and enjoy them.</p> 
<p>7. Keep the shovels, sand and grit handy. Contrary to what the temperatures 
have been, it<em>is</em> still winter and anything can happen!</p> 
<p>8. Let the protection (such as burlap ) around the plants be. The weather 
might still get harsh.</p> 
<p>9. Order seeds and plants for the spring. Get prepared with all the 
necessaries such as soil, compost, stakes, ties, etc.</p> 
<p>10. Get tools including mower blade sharpened.</p> 
<p>11. Prune grapevine. Roses can be pruned towards end of the month.</p> <br>

<h1>Lower King St. re-do is put off until 2014; town will do South Greeley 
first, in 2013</h1> 
<p><br>
 January 27, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>Last night the majority of the merchants on Lower King Street&mdash;and 
several of their landlords&mdash;came to the Community Center to learn whether 
the town board intends to conduct a major overhaul of their street this 
summer.&nbsp; Several merchants had asked in the weeks before that they be 
spared such disruption so soon after the inconvenience of bridge construction.
</p> 
<p>The project, Supervisor Susan Carpenter informed them, has been put off for 
two years and will most likely be undertaken in 2014.</p> <br>

<p>&ldquo;Our engineers tell us it&rsquo;s not realistic to think the job can 
be largely finished in July and August,&rdquo; Carpenter announced, &ldquo;and 
since we promised you last week that unless we could guarantee a summer finish, 
we wouldn&rsquo;t undertake the project,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s postponed.</p> 
<p>Instead, she explained, the town would now ask its engineering consultant, 
Dolph Rottfeld, to draw up plans for both the South Greeley / North Greeley 
Avenue and Lower King Street projects, then &ldquo;chop up&rdquo; the project 
into sensible pieces.&nbsp; She confirmed that engineers have judged South 
Greeley to be the more urgent case, to be tackled in 2013.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the 
project is being staged,&rdquo; Paderewski told the merchants, 
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll bring you along, bring you in to see the plans so you know 
exactly what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo; She encouraged them to add their email 
addresses to the sign-in sheet she had passed around.</p> 
<p>Although relieved that the digging up of their street and sidewalks is put 
off, merchants were also disappointed that the planned aesthetic 
improvements&mdash;the re-do of sidewalks and curbs, lighting to match the new 
lampposts around town, street signs and the fashioning of a small park at the 
very end of Lower King&mdash;must also be put off.</p> 
<p>Brito confirmed that the overall plan includes a stop sign the intersection 
of King and Greeley for traffic coming down the hill.&nbsp; Sidewalks will 
match the segment of brickwork on view in front of the gazebo.</p> 
<p>Susan Maher, proprietor of Breeze, asked whether she would have to wait for 
the overhaul to have the &ldquo;DO NOT ENTER&rdquo; sign at the 
curb&mdash;smack in front of her shop window&mdash;moved. Paderewski responded, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down with the commissioner of public works and take a 
look.&rdquo; Because Lower King is not a State or County road, the town has 
authority over the signs planted on it.</p> 
<p>When the owners of Aurora, Breeze and The King&rsquo;s Scribe asked whether 
they would have to wait three years for lighting at their end of the street, 
Mottel told them that lampposts would indeed have to wait, but that in the 
meantime, sconces on the buildings themselves had been recommended by 
consultants who worked on the downtown improvement plan.</p> 
<p>Several merchants reported that their basements prone to water 
seepage.&nbsp; Carpenter responded, &ldquo;This is the type of thing we need to 
hear from you.&nbsp; We<em>want</em> to hear from you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several 
merchants, in response, asked that the town commit to educate the town&rsquo;s 
residents&mdash; their customers&mdash;well in advance of any major disruptions.
</p> 
<p>Several merchants brought up the subject of a chamber of commerce, or lack 
thereof.&nbsp; Carpenter encouraged them to organize themselves into one they 
said existed, sort-of, or to form another. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an easy 
job,&rdquo; said Dawn Greenberg of Aurora.&nbsp; Paderewski confirmed that the 
town&rsquo;s new website, due to be unveiled at the end of February, will 
contain a merchant page.</p> 
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep meeting like this&rdquo;</strong></em>
</p> 
<p>Carpenter reminded merchants that the town board meets every week, 
alternating work sessions with regular, televised meetings.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always welcome at our meetings, and we&rsquo;ll notify you 
when these matters that directly effect you come up on our agendas.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll continue to have meetings like this one as we move 
forward,&rdquo; added Mottel.</p>

<h1>Chappaqua Farmers Market&mdash;green on green with Buddhapesto</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>Open Saturdays 9 am to 1:30 pm at St. Mary&rsquo;s next to Bel
</strong>l <br>
 January 27, 2012<br>
<em>by Pascale LeDraoulec</em></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making my own pesto for years&mdash;with everything from 
arugula to nettles&mdash;and so have most of my friends, so when I first 
discovered Buddhapesto and brought it to market, people wondered what all the 
fuss was about.</p> <br>

<p>When they tasted their artfully displayed samples&mdash;a dollop of the 
electric green sauce on a thin slice of Bread Alone baguette -&nbsp; they 
clammed right up and bought multiple tubs.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what mystery ingredient the folks at <strong>Buddhapesto
</strong> put into their blender to make this pesto so flavor-charged, but 
it&rsquo;s working! Their fan base is growing as quickly as August potted basil!
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m so thrilled that they will be joining our market in Chappaqua. 
Their debut was foiled last week by the ill-timed snow storm. I, for one, 
can&rsquo;t wait to try some of their pesto on any number of interesting 
organic small-batch pastas from<strong>Flour City Pasta</strong>.</p> 
<p>Of course, I put it on everything from scrambled eggs to poached fish to 
grilled lamb- (or ham-) burgers, too.&nbsp; Speaking of burgers&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Roaming Angus</strong> will have some fresh (not frozen) chickens 
this week as well as gorgeous cuts of beef. If you receive Roaming Angus&rsquo; 
email, then you learned this week that there are 29 (!) cuts of beef that are 
just as lean as chicken. And Roaming Angus carries many of them!</p> 
<p><strong>Stone Barns</strong> is continuing with their &ldquo;barn 
sale&rdquo; on everything pork&hellip;now is the time to dig into that pulled 
pork recipe you&rsquo;ve been wanting to try.&nbsp; They also have great plump 
roaster chickens (frozen), ground lamb and those amazing eggs in the sunny 
carton.</p> 
<p><strong>Pura Vida</strong> brought a small amount of ridiculously sweet, 
tiny Maine shrimp last week. The season is fleeting so get them while you can. 
So good, a few of us ate some raw at the market last Saturday!</p> 
<p><strong>Kontoulis Olive Oil</strong>, a monthly vendor, is also paying us a 
visit so be sure to bring your home bottles for re-filling or, if you&rsquo;ve 
never treated yourself to her shimmering green nectar, take some home and watch 
it make your salads sing. Remember: Demetra won&rsquo;t be back before 
Valentine&rsquo;s Day - and a gift of any combination of her luscious oil with 
either tapenade, or balsamic vinegar, would make<em>my</em> heart sing.</p> 
<p><strong>Little Croc Bakery</strong> (gluten-free) and <strong>Big Girl 
Bakery</strong> are also here this week to satisfy all your sweet tooth needs. 
</p> 
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to report that <strong>Lasagna Preziosa</strong> is 
returning to the market on a once-monthly basis, starting this Saturday.&nbsp; 
Surely you remember his surprisingly light and delicate lasagna bolognese and 
his pesto lasagna, made with green beans and potatoes, and of course, pesto.</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;.are you sensing a theme here?</p> 
<p>See you at the market!</p> 
<p>Author/foodie Pascale LeDroulec is Director of the Chappaqua Farmers Market.

<h1>Merchant of the Week&mdash; Judy&rsquo;s Quinn&rsquo;s family-run Quaker 
Hill Tavern</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Kelly Sullivan and Manager Erin Teter; photograph by Kevan Full, at
kevanslens.com</em><br>
 January 27, 2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>This week I stopped in at the Quaker Hill Tavern to sample some chicken 
wings and beer and talk to Judy Quinn, co-owner of QHT.</p> <br>

<p><strong>How long has the Quaker Hill Tavern been a member of our community?
</strong></p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve been here since March 2005.&nbsp; I own the restaurant with my 
daughter Kelly and her husband Tim Sullivan, a/k/a &ldquo;Sully.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Community and family are important foundations for our restaurant.<br>
<br>

<strong>Does running the restaurant with your daughter and son-in-law affect 
your management style?&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Yes.&nbsp; We have always believed in using a more family 
oriented-management style versus a corporate philosophy to run our 
business.&nbsp; We believe if you treat your employees like family they will 
take care of your business like they are part of your family and&mdash;most 
importantly&mdash; take care of our customers like they are part of our 
family.&nbsp; In a sense our customer base is a large part of our extended 
family.</p> 
<p><strong>It sounds as though Quaker Tavern is like Cheers, where everybody 
knows your name.</strong></p> 
<p>Many of our staff have been working here for a number of years, most 
notably our manager Erin Teter.&nbsp; Erin knows everyone by name and usually 
knows what someone will order before they say it.&nbsp; We make it a point to 
get to know our customers and we believe this is what sets us apart from other 
places.&nbsp; You can step in to Quaker Hill and be reassured that you will 
know someone working and most likely they will know your name or what you drink 
and we believe that helps people feel at home.</p> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your most popular food, and how do most customers like 
their chicken wings?</strong></p> 
<p>Our Buffalo wings are a big hit all year long so we always have enough on 
hand.&nbsp; Rest assured football/super bowl fans, we will be loaded up for the 
big game.&nbsp; The most popular way we sell wings is by the bucket with medium 
buffalo sauce, extra homemade blue cheese dressing, celery and carrot 
sticks.&nbsp; Our house salmon burger, home-made, has some very loyal 
fans.&nbsp; We find that any way we prepare salmon it is always a big hit.<br>

<br> <strong>What&rsquo;s your personal favorite food and beverage?</strong></p>
<p>As far as wine, one of my personal favorites is Kali Hart Chardonnay, which 
is available by glass or bottle.&nbsp; My favorite local beer is Captain 
Lawrence on tap, as well as Captain&rsquo;s Imperial Reserve in a bottle.&nbsp; 
The recent addition of short ribs has many mouths watering.<br>
<br>
<strong>Do 
you do a lot of community events?</strong>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Yes.&nbsp; We do our best to support the community through donations.&nbsp; 
We have donated gift certificates, trays of food and advertise in school 
programs for plays and sports.&nbsp; We feel the community doubles our support 
through their patronage at QHT.</p> 
<p><strong>I know you have expressed interest in working with the turf 
committee to help raise money, why is that so important to you?</strong></p> 
<p>A state-of-the- art illuminated field at Horace Greeley High School would 
be a tremendous asset for our sports programs, as well as our community in 
general.&nbsp; We are looking forward to working with the turf committee to 
help raise money.&nbsp; In fact, we hope to have a fund-raising event here 
sometime in February.</p> 
<p><strong>Any food and beer specials for big sporting events?</strong></p> 
<p>Usually, we do have some.&nbsp; For example, we have a Super Bowl Sunday 
Special, $25 all you can eat buffet, starting at 6:00 p.m., cash bar (no 
regular dining service after 6:00 p.m.&mdash;only Super Bowl Special).&nbsp; We 
have eight large TVs and surround-sound.&nbsp; Check our website
www.quakerhilltavern.com for upcoming specials and holiday events.&nbsp; 
Although we don&rsquo;t deliver, we have take out available all day and 
night.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll be opening for lunch on Mondays, starting Feb 20th.
<br> <br>
<strong>What do you think the town could do to make conditions better 
for business?</strong></p> 
<p>It would be helpful if a little more emphasis was placed on including 
businesses at the top of the hill when scheduling events such as sidewalk sale 
days and Community Day.</p> 
<p><strong>Any special discounts for NewCastleNOW readers who mention this 
article?</strong></p> 
<p>Sure, a ten percent discount for the next week.</p>

<h1>Greeley Wrestling set to honor seniors on Wednesday</h1> 
<p> <br>
 January 27, 2012<br>
<em>by Coach Mike DeBellis</em></p> 
<p>On Wednesday, February 1st, the Greeley Wrestling team will honor its seven 
seniors and their parents during their match against Pleasantville.&nbsp; The 
match and festivities will begin at 4:30 p.m. in the wrestling gym at Horace 
Greeley High School.</p> <br>

<p>Captain Jon Russo, Mike Nadler, Mike Orbeta, Matt Mercer, Kolbe Jendzejec, 
Ben Perlmutter, and Farhan Chaudhry will be honored for their part in turning 
the Horace Greeley Wrestling team back into a powerhouse.&nbsp; In the 
2008-2009 season, these men started their Greeley wrestling careers.&nbsp; That 
year the team was 6-10, finished fifth in the league and they collectively 
scored 11 individual wins for the team.&nbsp; This year, so far, the team is 
17-6, second in the league, and they have collectively scored 80 individual 
wins for the team.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Farhan Chaudhry has been sidelined most of the season with a nagging 
shoulder injury but has started on varsity since he was a freshman.&nbsp; He 
also spent a month in Minnesota training with legendary wrestling coach J. 
Robinson.</p> 
<p>Ben Perlmutter has won some big matches for us over the years and continues 
to be to be a great leader for all of our newcomers.</p> 
<p>Kolbe Jendzejec came to us as a sophomore and is an all-county runner in 
the fall and spring but wanted to do something different in the winter. He has 
proven to be a clutch performer, winning a huge match that put us over the top 
against rival Port Chester this season.</p> 
<p>Matt Mercer started on varsity as a junior and posted 18 wins.&nbsp; He 
currently has 14 wins this season.</p> 
<p>Mike Nadler had eight wins last season and stepped his game up to the next 
level with 15 wins this year.</p> 
<p>Mike Orbeta has wrestled on varsity since he was a freshman. He is a great 
leader and works with our youth every night.&nbsp; He currently has 16 wins and 
is looking to improve on that mark in the post season.</p> 
<p>Captain Jon Russo has proven himself again this year riding a 28 win season 
into the post season.&nbsp; Jon won 20 matches as a sophomore and 30 as a 
junior.&nbsp; Jon also was named all-league last season.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Each one of these individuals has done their part to make this team a great 
success in their tenure. Please come watch their last varsity home match and 
support the efforts and sacrifices these young men have made throughout the 
years.&nbsp; We will be wrestling a tough and well-coached Pleasantville 
team.&nbsp; If you have never been to a wrestling match, I guarantee you will 
have fun.&nbsp; We will be giving out Horace Greeley bandanas to the first 25 
students to the match.&nbsp; Help us celebrate 7 great careers.</p> <br>

<h1>Last year, six snow storms by now; this year three</h1> 
<p><br>
 January 27, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>By this time last year, says Commissioner Anthony Vaccaro, New Castle had 
weathered six snowstorms totaling 40 inches of snow on 120 miles of road (= 240 
lane miles).&nbsp; So far this year the town has seen only three events 
requiring salting or plowing:&nbsp; the out-of-season October 26 snowstorm that 
wreaked havoc on trees and powerlines, a freezing rain on January 16 and the 
one-day-winter-wonderland last Saturday.</p> <br>

<p>One year ago, the 1,650 tons of salt plus crew members working for 98 hours 
of snow removal for the six six snowfalls had cost around $173,000.&nbsp; As of 
today, the town has spent $83,256 for 46 hours of crew work and 666 tons of 
salt on 17 inches of snow.</p> 
<p>The town is divided into 17 zones for plowing purposes.&nbsp; For 
full-blown storms, the nine highway department drivers are supplemented by 
drivers from the town&rsquo;s recycling, building and water departments.</p> 
<p><em><strong>So far, a mild winter</strong></em></p> 
<p>Crews spent more time (working 19 hours straight) but less salt (120 tons 
for 12 inches of snowfall, or $6,720) on the October 26 snowstorm than for the 
January 16 freezing rain, when they worked 11 hours straight and used 252 tons 
of salt.&nbsp; Vaccaro attributes this to the fact that temperatures before the 
October storm were very mild, so there was no frost in the ground; 
consequently, crews were able to rely on plowing to do most of the clearing, 
with salting done only at the very end.</p> 
<p>Although no snow fell on January 16&mdash;and temperatures had begun to 
rise, resulting rain-only&mdash;freezing temperatures in the days before the 
rain of January 16 required all-out salting on a continuous basis, Vaccaro 
explained, &ldquo;to &lsquo;burn&rsquo; the ice down to the 
pavement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The storm one week ago, on January 21, was the first for which crews laid 
down a pre-application of brine.&nbsp; Before the snow comes, workers go out 
along the roadways in trucks with large plastic tanks distributing liquid brine 
from five nozzles behind.&nbsp; (These are the five parallel whitish tracks 
that appear on road surfaces as the brine dries.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once the snow hits, the brine works on the snow or ice from below as 
plowing and salting goes on above.&nbsp; &ldquo;The brine is very 
effective,&rdquo; Vaccaro explained, &ldquo;in preventing ice from bonding to 
surfaces, and also buys us some time before plows or salting is 
required.&rdquo; The risk, though, he added, is that &ldquo;with rain and 
freezing rain (depending on road temperatures) the brine treatment can easily 
wash away.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>On January 21, crews began at 3:00 a.m. Saturday and worked through to 7:00 
p.m. that night.&nbsp; At around 6:00 p.m. Vaccaro learned that there had been 
a water main break at the intersection of Harscrabble and Tanglewild, which 
workers carried through overnight to fix.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Brine had been applied to roadways the day and night before the January 21 
storm and&mdash;for the first time&mdash;workers applied brine to the 
town-owned sections of sidewalk, some at the train station, others in the 
downtown.&nbsp; The sidewalks were brined on foot, by a worker with a back-pack 
container of the solution and a spray wand.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>According to Vaccaro, salt is currently about $12 cheaper per ton than last 
year&mdash;$53 per ton vs. $65 per ton.&nbsp; He has plenty of salt now in his 
stores.</p> <br>

<h1>Press Release from &ldquo;WeeZee ... World of Yes I Can&rdquo;</h1> 
<p>First Indoor Sensory Playspace in Westchester to Open in March in Chappaqua
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;WeeZee&hellip;World of Yes I Can&rdquo; Gets Ready to Open almost 
25,000 Square Feet at Chappaqua Crossing</p> <br>

<p>Chappaqua, NY &ndash; Westchester&rsquo;s first indoor sensory playspace 
and the largest facility of its kind in the country, WeeZee&hellip; World of 
Yes I Can, has broken ground and plans to open in March.&nbsp; The indoor play 
space, to include an innovative concept and design, as well as state-of-the-art 
equipment, will span almost 16,000 square feet with an additional 8,500 square 
feet set aside for health care and other professionals at the new Chappaqua 
Crossing business development located at 480 Bedford Road in Chappaqua, 
NY.&nbsp; An original opening of 10,000 square feet in Armonk had been planned 
for WeeZee, but an expanded design and additional features made it necessary 
for the company to seek space that included more square footage and an open air 
concept.</p> 
<p>WeeZee will offer a host of highly engaging, interactive and imaginative 
sensory experiences in a safe, supervised environment. The 35 different 
elements of training equipment&mdash;designed to strengthen nervous system 
conduction in a way that improves academic performance, athletic coordination 
and social connections in children of all ages&mdash;includes a Rainforest 
&amp; Storm Zone (tactile water/wind experience), Reaction Training &amp; 
Sports Enhancement Stalls (hand-eye coordination), a Vibration Station (core 
stabilization), a Cyber-action Floor (anticipation in movement), a Fiber Optic 
Light Room (visual optimization), and a state of the art Music Room 
(fully-equipped sound studio with karaoke room). Next to Wee-Wonz (Tot 
Zone)&mdash;parents can wait while their children play and relax in the Wi-Fi, 
adults-only Zen Den. This room is equipped with massage chairs and iPads for 
parents to chat, read, watch movies or catch up on the latest breakthroughs in 
children&rsquo;s learning patterns and learning disabilities.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;WeeZee is a family&rsquo;s fantasy come to life,&rdquo; says 
founder Louise Weadock, a registered Child Psychiatric Nurse, graduate of Johns 
Hopkins School of Public Health and owner of the 27 year old, ACCESS Nursing 
&amp; Healthcare Services, based in Pleasantville, NY. &ldquo;We have created a 
unique environment that offers children a time to play and learn that is 
unforgettable.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Weadock said that &ldquo;similar to the way fitness clubs improve physical 
capability by focusing on muscle tone and flexibility, WeeZee seeks to improve 
cognitive capability by focusing on the senses to challenge intellectual 
curiosity in children of all abilities, ages 1-12.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>WeeZee&rsquo;s program will also be sensitive to the needs of children with 
learning -disabilities spanning the spectrum from dyslexia to autism, and will 
offer them &ldquo;the most appealing play options,&rdquo; she added.</p> 
<p>Weadock, whose daughter was diagnosed at four years old with a severe 
Sensory Integration Disorder, became fascinated with the effects multi-sensory 
experiences had on her child&rsquo;s ability to understand, accept and adapt to 
her world. &ldquo;As an athlete, I understood the value that constant training 
played on increased performance. I knew that any prescribed therapy twice a 
week was not enough to get my daughter&rsquo;s nervous system in sufficient 
sensory-shape to learn!&rdquo; So, she purchased a diverse variety of sensory 
equipment and created a playground in the basement of her home for all the 
neighborhood children to enjoy with her daughter.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We turned our home into a desensitizing &ldquo;fun zone&rdquo; for 
all.&nbsp; Our house became a place that was always full of kids having the 
time of their lives while increasing their ability to learn&rdquo; said 
Weadock. &ldquo;The kids thought I was a &lsquo;cool Mom&rsquo;&hellip; their 
parents thought I was Nuts!!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sixteen years later, and following the growth of her successful regional 
healthcare personnel company, ACCESS Nursing &amp; Healthcare Services; Weadock 
is launching what will become the largest and most cutting-edge indoor play 
space for cognitive development in Westchester County and the entire New York 
region.</p> 
<p>With the additional square footage at Chappaqua Crossing, Weadock is 
creating &ldquo;A Village&rdquo; of offices to be licensed by sensory-focused 
and wellness-related, medical, non-medical, social and academic professionals 
that serve all family members.</p> 
<p> The remaining space will provide an office headquarters for 
Weadock&rsquo;s ACCESS Nursing &amp; Healthcare Services, currently located on 
Manville Road in Pleasantville.</p> 
<p> The opening of WeeZee in Westchester County will create more than 100 
full- and part-time jobs in a variety of different fields including coaching, 
therapy, education, design and clerical. Weadock hopes that these positions can 
be filled by recent college grads and returning veterans &ldquo;who are having 
the hardest time of all finding a job.&rdquo;&nbsp; There will also be 
opportunities for medical and academic internships for high school, college and 
medical school students. In addition, there will be an extensive Volunteer 
Program that provides opportunities to work with children who need extra 
support.</p> 
<p> Consistent with other healthcare professionals employed by ACCESS Nursing, 
all WeeZee volunteers, interns, Villagers and employees seeking to be involved 
in this exciting new adventure in learning, will be subject to an extensive 
background check.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Our vision is for WeeZee to become a fun place where kids can make 
friends, have unique experiences, expand their imaginations and improve their 
cognitive performance,&rdquo; says Weadock. &ldquo;We want the sensory 
adventures and social relationships discovered inside WeeZee to inspire each 
child to believe, &ldquo;Yes I Can&rdquo;!!!</p> 
<p> WeeZee will be open from 8:00am to 9:00pm seven days a week. Annual 
memberships are available.</p> 
<p> Construction has begun and a Grand Opening event is scheduled to take

<h1>Merchants fret that planned repairs to Lower King will hurt business</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Cindy Lupica of Marmalade, Dawn Greenberg of Aurora; see plan of 
park on Lower King in &ldquo;Read more&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br>
 January 20, 2012
<br> <em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>The town board has included in this year&rsquo;s capital budget funds to 
repair 100-year-old sewer and water lines under South Greeley as well as those 
under Lower King Street.&nbsp; Expert consultants have warned that both sets 
are badly in need of replacement within the next two years, but some merchants 
on Lower King are worried that their businesses will suffer.</p> <br>

<p>When they presented their budget last fall, town board members expressed 
their intention to hold off on the South Greeley project, since the merchants 
and their customers had just endured a lengthy bridge construction process on 
their front sides and parking lot re-do in back.&nbsp; The board turned its 
attention instead to Lower King. Some merchants there, however, pleaded to have 
the project to Lower King delayed too.</p> 
<p>In its work session on Tuesday, town board members reviewed the 
town&rsquo;s plan for improvements to Lower King Street: redo the four 
crosswalks of the Starbuck&rsquo;s intersection and add a stop sign, move 
angled parking from the north side of Lower King to the south side, redo 
sidewalks and curbs, add lighting and create a seating area at the very end of 
the street. Around $650,000 has been allocated for the changes. Since both 
South Greeley and Lower King have been diagnosed as urgent cases for repair, 
the board wants at least one of them to be done this summer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Three merchants from Lower King attended the meeting and gave differing 
input to the board. Two were new to the block, one has operated there for eight 
years.</p> 
<p>Cindy Lupica of Marmalade, in business for eight years, begged board 
members to spare Lower King merchants the disruption.&nbsp; They, too, she 
asserted, had suffered during the period of bridge construction and needed a 
respite now.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really feel you need to give us a chance to get 
back some traction from customers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will really hurt 
my business if you start three months from now.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it did with the 
parking lot redo behind the South Greeley shops, the town is attempting to 
accomplish the most dramatic of the repairs to Lower King during the summer 
months, when the population is low.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather live 
another year with shabby sidewalks and get some confidence back from 
customers,&rdquo; Lupica concluded.</p> 
<p><br>
<em>Pocket park plan for end of Lower King</em></p> 
<p>Dawn Greenberg, the owner of Aurora, the very last store on Lower King, and 
Susan Maher, who owns Breeze, the shop next door, share a landlord.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m new,&rdquo; said Greenberg, &ldquo;but I feel as though 
it&rsquo;s so hideous down at our end of the street, with no lighting or 
anything and a landlady who won&rsquo;t do anything [by way of 
improvements].&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get on with it.&nbsp; I think it needs to be 
done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Maher, newest on the block, concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for 
beautification,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would love a beautiful little 
park at the end of the street.&nbsp; There are five new businesses on Lower 
King, so there will be an impact.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, she noted, Breeze had only 
just opened in September, so she was less familiar with the disruption caused 
by the bridge.&nbsp; She<em>was</em> sure about the difficulty of the street 
sign that stands at the curb smack in the middle of her front shop window and 
hoped that in a redo it might disappear. Both women said that their end of 
Lower King is very dark at night and that they would appreciate some lighting.
</p> 
<p>Supervisor Susan Carpenter told the three women that &ldquo;at some point 
you have to worry about whether the infrastructure will hold&mdash;if we have 
breaks, it really<em>will </em>put you out of business.&rdquo;&nbsp; She and 
Town Administrator Penelle Paderewski assured the three merchants that if the 
project plans and consultants can be lined up quickly, the most disruptive 
work&mdash;the tearing up of the street surface&mdash;would be accomplished in 
two months, July and August, effectively done by The Return to School in 
September.&nbsp; And at no time, they promised, would the entire street be made 
impassible.&nbsp; Parking might disappear for a time, but there would always be 
through-traffic.&nbsp; Once the pipes are replaced, the street itself will be 
repaired.&nbsp; Next come sidewalks, then the park at the end.</p> 
<p>Everything depends on whether the plans can be finalized and the 
consultants and contractors lined up fairly soon, said Paderewski.&nbsp; If 
these can&rsquo;t be arranged so that the work is finished by end of summer, 
she told the merchants, then the board would likely put it off.</p> <br>

<h1>Another tenant at Chappaqua Crossing&mdash;Access Nursing Services and 
WeeZee</h1> 
<p>January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>On Wednesday, Chappaqua crossing announced that it has signed a long-term 
lease for 24,000 square feet of space in Building 400 of its office campus with
<strong>WeeZee World of Yes, I Can!</strong>, a challenging and appealing play 
space for children with conditions ranging from dyslexia to autism.</p> <br>

<p>Already under construction, by March 2012 WeeZee will open its 
15,000-square-foot indoor sensory playspace which WeeZee&rsquo;s website 
characterizes as &ldquo;somewhere between a children&rsquo;s museum, an indoor 
playground and a children&rsquo;s learning center &ndash; WeeZee World will 
offer a host of highly engaging, interactive and imaginative sensory 
experiences in a safe, supervised environment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The remaining 9,000 square feet will serve as corporate headquarters of 
ACCESS Nursing Services, a nursing and home health care aide service operating 
in New York, New Jersey and Maryland.&nbsp; Both ACCESS and WeeZee were founded 
by Briarcliff resident Louise (nickname: WeeZee) Weadock, a child psychiatric 
nurse.</p> 
<p>WeeZee will be open seven days a week, from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and 
provide around 100 full- and part-time jobs as well as internships for students.
</p> 
<p>ACCESS currently operates from Pleasantville; WeeZee is a new 
creation.&nbsp; Weadock was to have opened both businesses last October in 
Armonk&rsquo;s Labriola Court, but found she needed the greater space available 
at Chappaqua Crossing.&nbsp; The 24,000-square-foot ACCESS and WeeZee tenants 
join Northern Westchester Hospital and Fiber Media, each with 35,000 square 
feet, Mount Kisco Medical Group (40,000 square feet) and Government Services 
Administration (GSA, 6,000 square feet).</p>

<h1>A green way to move the snow</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Hubby and the wovel (&ldquo;wheel&rdquo; + 
&ldquo;shovel&rdquo;&mdash;rhymes with &ldquo;shovel&rdquo;)</em><br>
 Monday, 
January 23, 2012<br>
<em>by Susan Rubin</em></p> 
<p>It is 23 days into 2012 and on Saturday we finally got some seasonally 
appropriate weather. While I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of winter and snow, I do 
realize that the cold dark stillness of winter is necessary for a green and 
vibrant spring. One thing I dislike more than snow is snow blowers. I 
can&rsquo;t stand the noise and I don&rsquo;t enjoy breathing in the toxic 
stinky fumes. Quite frankly, I harbor a deep concern whenever fossil fuels are 
burned. We&rsquo;ve got to find ways to cut our addiction to gas, coal and oil 
on every level if we care about future generations surviving on our planet.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Last year, when my husband threatened to buy a snow blower, I took swift 
and decisive action. I bought a wovel online before he could get his act 
together and purchase a snow blower.&nbsp; He rolled his eyes skyward as he 
watched me assemble this crazy combination of wheel and shovel in our living 
room. Needless to say, he was extremely skeptical that my new toy would really 
move the snow out of our driveway.<br>
<br>
 This contraption was named <em>Time
</em> magazine&rsquo;s best invention of 2006. The Wovel is super green, it is 
recognized by Co-op America and National Green Pages&trade; for its positive, 
pollution-free environmental standards and zero carbon footprint in usage.<br>

<br> This wacky snow removal device performs equal to or better than a snow 
blower, and doesn&rsquo;t hurt your back at all. As it catapults the snow 
effortlessly off of your driveway, your tricep muscles get a nice 
workout.&nbsp; Using the wovel is no more stressful than walking, its easy to 
use for both young and old alike.&nbsp; Unlike most things we buy these days, 
it is manufactured in the USA.<br>
<br>
 Last winter&rsquo;s frequent snow 
storms gave our Wovel a run for the money. It worked so well that my hubby 
admitted to me that the Wovel was one of my best hare-brained ideas.&nbsp; The 
cost of the wovel is under $200, if you pay to plow your driveway, you&rsquo;ll 
no doubt save more than $200 over the course of a snowy winter<br>

<h1>Knowledge Caf&eacute; results are in&mdash;on what to cut and how to raise 
revenues</h1> 
<p>January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em><br>
<strong>With 36 
comments since publication</strong></p> 
<p>In his draft budget for 2012-2013, Superintendent for Business John Chow 
provided a rollover figure&mdash;the increased cost of continuing the current 
program&mdash;of $2.8 million.&nbsp; Of that, the district is allowed a budget 
increase of around $1.4 million (labeled &ldquo;tax cap limit&rdquo; in 
Chow&rsquo;s presentation), leaving administrators and board of ed members to 
find $1.3 million in reductions, which may include up to five full time 
teaching positions. Chow&rsquo;s draft budget&mdash;not yet even a 
&ldquo;proposed&rdquo; budget, he emphasizes&mdash;also assumes the use of $3 
million in reserves.</p> <br>

<p>Not yet counted toward the reductions is the $500,000 in savings expected 
from the change in middle school schedule&mdash;with teachers of core subjects 
teaching more minutes in periods of 55 minutes.&nbsp; Those savings may be less 
now that administrators have found that an increase in the student population 
at Seven Bridges may require the hiring of two additional core subject teachers.
</p> 
<p>In the meantime, Superintendent Lyn McKay has released the results of the 
December 7 Knowledge Caf&eacute; at which 56 participants were asked to 
brainstorm on ways to reduce the district&rsquo;s budget by around $1.8 million 
(now down to $1.3 in Chow&rsquo;s draft budget), to suggest new sources of 
revenue, and to identify long-term budget concerns (these turn out to be, 
mainly, unfunded mandates and the paucity of commercial revenue sources in New 
Castle&rsquo;s tax base).&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As she promised she would, McKay has included not only the Budget Advisory 
Committee&rsquo;s summary of the results (see below), but also two forms of raw 
data: the notes taken by facilitators at the Knowledge Cafe tables and the 
tablecloth jottings of the resident, parent, teacher and administrator 
participants (links are below).&nbsp; All these are provided below (and can 
also be found on the district&rsquo;s website by clicking<strong>HERE</strong>):
</p> 
<h2>Summary of December 7th Knowledge Caf&eacute;</h2> 
<p>The District held a Knowledge Caf&eacute; on December 7, 2011 with the 
following stated purposes:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; 1. To answer the Board of Education&rsquo;s strategic question 
&ndash; &ldquo;How can the District ensure continuing excellence in academic 
and extracurricular programs while developing a budget that is fiscally 
responsible?&rdquo;<br>
 &nbsp; 2. To engage the Chappaqua school community in 
exploring budgetary ideas.</p> 
<p>Fifty-six members of the community and staff attended the Knowledge 
Caf&eacute;. The first hour was devoted to disseminating budget information to 
participants and the second hour was devoted to small group work sessions to 
solicit answers to the following three questions:</p> 
<p>&nbsp; * Expenditures &ndash; What can we give up and what are the 
tradeoffs &ndash; give examples?<br>
 &nbsp; * Revenue &ndash; How else can we 
generate additional revenues to support the school budget?<br>
 &nbsp; * Long 
Term &ndash; What is a long-term financial issue that the school district must 
begin to address now? And, how?</p> 
<p>The District&rsquo;s Finance Advisory Committee was then charged with the 
responsibility of reviewing all comments and providing an executive summary. 
Below are highlights from the facilitator and tablecloth notes, which were 
collected at the Knowledge Caf&eacute;. The complete set of notes can be read 
at the following links:</p> 
<p>Knowledge Cafe Facilitator Notes<br>
Knowledge Cafe Tablecloth Notes</p> 
<p><strong>LONG TERM QUESTION</strong></p> 
<p>The comments from the Long Term Question encompass both expenditures and 
revenue. They present big challenges, not solvable by local Board of Education 
action alone. These are the issues, however, that drive the largest 
expenditures in the budget and can have the most impact on the tax levy.</p> 
<p>State law constraints and mandates cause the greatest pressure on district 
spending. The pension contribution system, unfunded and under-funded state 
mandates, the tenure system and the Triborough Amendment were all repeatedly 
cited. It was suggested that the Board of Education and/or citizen groups lobby 
Albany both independently and in conjunction with other communities.</p> 
<p>On the revenue side, the biggest long-term issue concerns the need to 
increase the commercial tax base. The town&rsquo;s lack of a vibrant commercial 
tax base lowers the overall assessed value of the town and shifts a greater 
percentage of the tax burden to the residential properties. A coordinated 
effort by town and business groups to &ldquo;lure&rdquo; businesses to town is 
needed. The benefits will not be realized for many years, but the district/town 
must start exploring options at once.</p> 
<p><strong>REVENUE QUESTION</strong></p> 
<p>Various suggestions were made for increasing revenue. One important factor 
to consider is not to overuse one-shot revenue items. If the district is very 
successful at raising one-time funds in a given year, the short-term benefit 
may be a reduced tax levy for that year. Success at lowering the tax levy will 
have the perverse consequence of further limiting the expenditures for the 
following year.</p> 
<p>In addition to the suggestion to raise the commercial tax base, the 
following items were suggested as possible sources of revenue for the district.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp; * Sell excess property<br>
 &nbsp; * Charge for use of facilities: 
Increase user fees, rent out excess space<br>
 &nbsp; * Reexamine busing 
&ndash; fees for longer routes, out-of-district routes<br>
 &nbsp; * 
Pay-to-play: Charging students for participation in athletics, theater and 
clubs. Legal question: Can the district still pay the salaries and other costs 
of the program, or do those costs have to be paid by a separate non-profit 
entity? If not, both revenue and expenditure get removed from the district 
budget. If the district wanted to restore district control of the program in 
the future, it would likely create a tax-cap issue. (Removal of expenditure 
probably lowers tax levy or is replaced by a different expenditure and 
can&rsquo;t be added back under the cap.)<br>
 &nbsp; * Special Education: 
Charge other districts to educate special needs students. To have economies of 
scale, these students might need to be housed in one building.<br>
 &nbsp; * 
Increase fees: admission to events, parking for HGHS Seniors<br>
 &nbsp; * 
Commercial sponsorships &ndash; buildings, fields; cell towers, cafeteria 
items, technology<br>
 &nbsp; * Create and sell curriculum to other districts, 
on-line courses<br>
 &nbsp; * Fundraisers: kids&rsquo; art auctions, branded 
credit cards, alumni donations, grants<br>
 &nbsp; * Tuition-based summer 
program</p> 
<p><strong>EXPENDITURE QUESTION</strong></p> 
<p>There are some small items that can be implemented to reduce expenditures 
by a small amount. Real savings won&rsquo;t be achieved without changes in 
Albany (as discussed above) and/or major structural changes to how we deliver 
education in Chappaqua, e.g., eliminating programs, significantly increasing 
class size, eliminating teams, etc.</p> 
<p>Items mentioned at the caf&eacute; include:</p> 
<p>&nbsp; * Seek efficiencies in transportation, reduce number of buses, 
eliminate short routes. (environmental trade-off)<br>
 &nbsp; * Conserve 
resources, shutter some buildings on weekends<br>
 &nbsp; * &frac12; day 
kindergarten<br>
 &nbsp; * Seek Special Education efficiencies<br>
 &nbsp; * 
Reduce staff: increase class size, reduce course offerings, 
consolidate/reconfigure schools, on-line courses<br>
 &nbsp; * Reduce 
professional development<br>
 &nbsp; * Reduce number of administrators<br>
 
&nbsp; * Hire retired staff (no pension pay-in)<br>
 &nbsp; * Reduce number of 
aides (use parent volunteers)</p>

<h1>Greeley grad Jason Raylesberg will Teach for America</h1> 
<p><br>
 January 20, 2012</p> 
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s Note:</em> From an applicant pool of over 46,000 this 
year, Jason Raylesberg, HGHS Class of 2008, has landed a coveted place with
Teach for America.&nbsp; Starting in September, he&rsquo;ll teach for two 
years&mdash;whatever subject is needed&mdash;in a school with impoverished 
students in New York City.&nbsp;<em>NCNOW</em> asked Raylesberg about the 
application process and why he applied.</p> <br>

<p><strong>Why did you apply to Teach for America?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I am double&ndash;majoring in English and Music at Columbia University. I 
applied to Teach for America (TFA) mainly because of a long-held passion for 
teaching. In high school I taught saxophone lessons to students at Mount Vernon 
Elementary School, and at Columbia I am co-Founder and co-President of Musical 
Mentors Collaborative, Inc., an organization that pairs Columbia students with 
over 30 underprivileged elementary school students.&nbsp; These college kids 
(including the Executive Board) teach one-on-one instrumental lessons while the 
program provides free tickets to family concerts at the best concert halls in 
New York and holds workshops for both students and instructors led by Columbia 
professors, PhD students, and Grammy-winning musicians. I&rsquo;ve seen through 
my work with Musical Mentors how powerful and easy it can be to make an 
incredible difference using resources I and so many students have been blessed 
with and sometimes take for granted. TFA&rsquo;s mission is built upon a very 
similar premise, and I&rsquo;m really excited to do my best to make an even 
larger impact over the next couple of years. And I&rsquo;m especially excited 
to do so in New York City, a place I&rsquo;ve come to know and love so much.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>How often do the college kids and elementary kids meet?</strong></p>
<p> </p> 
<p>Lessons are held weekly, ranging from thirty minutes to an hour. At the end 
of each semester, students perform in a recital.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Will the group continue after you&rsquo;ve left Columbia?</strong>
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Yes. We have a phenomenal Executive Board in place for next year, and I 
plan to continue playing a role in expanding the scope of the program over the 
coming years.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>What was the TFA application process like?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>There are three rounds to the process. First, a written application, on 
which I was prompted to write a personal statement. The second round consists 
of a phone interview and online activity. The third round is a full day 
interview where I taught a five-minute lesson, participated in a group activity 
with other candidates, and had a personal interview. The third round ended up 
being more fun than I expected.&nbsp; In it, we had to listen to other 
candidates&rsquo; (fun and interactive) lessons, i.e. to pretend that we were 
in elementary school, middle school, and high school all over again. It brought 
me back to those good ol&rsquo; Chappaqua school days.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Do you know other teachers in the program?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I have several friends currently in the program, and all encouraged me to 
apply. So I listened, and am thankful I did.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Will you teach forever, or do you have some other plan?</strong></p>
<p> </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure where I&rsquo;ll stand on future plans in two 
years, but right now I am considering pursuing a graduate degree in Musicology, 
Law, or perhaps eventually teaching at the collegiate level.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>When does school start and do you know already that you&rsquo;re 
teaching here in New York City?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>All incoming TFA corps members attend an intensive five-week summer 
institute which is meant to prepare us for the upcoming school year. For NYC 
Corps members, that institute begins in late June. I know that I will be 
teaching in New York City, but I don&rsquo;t yet know which school.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>How are assignments made?&nbsp; Did you request NYC or was it 
randomly chosen for you?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Over the months before the new school year, incoming corps members 
interview with principals of various under-resourced schools in their assigned 
region. Working with TFA, the principals choose which corps members they want 
in their school. TFA asks you to put down ten preferred regions on the 
application, and NYC was my first preference. Fortunately, they granted it to 
me.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>What subject or grade will you teach?</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>My assignment is &ldquo;General Education, Special Education, or ELS&rdquo; 
in any grade, K-12. So I could end up teaching almost anything, really, from 
middle school math to 3rd grade General Education. It depends on which 
principals are interested in hiring me and which positions are in most demand.
</p> 
<p><strong>Where did you get the teaching bug?</strong></p> 
<p>I admired certain qualities in all of my teachers, from freshman to senior 
year, and hope to have the same impact on my students that they had on 
me.&nbsp; As a teacher, I hope to channel the infectious enthusiasm of Ms. 
Slavinski, Doc Lucia&rsquo;s ability to build friendships with his students, 
and Ms. Breen&rsquo;s knack for presenting material as clear as can be.</p> <br>

which they won 95 to 86.</p> <br>

<p><em><strong>Suffern, 2009 Section 1 champs, took on the Aquamen on Jan. 12
</strong></em> </p> 
<p>The last time the Greeley Boys&rsquo; Swimming and Diving Team lost a meet, 
it was to Suffern High School two years ago, so the team knew they would need 
to swim fast to beat this recent Section 1 champ. Before the meet began, Coach 
Meg Kaplan stressed to the swimmers that this meet could be tough mainly 
because all of Suffern&rsquo;s relay teams were ranked with faster times than 
Greeley&rsquo;s. However, the boys did not let this scare them.</p> 
<p>The Greeley Aquamen won many of their events.&nbsp; The first event was the 
200 Medley Relay, and with a photo finish the Greeley relay touched out 
Suffern&rsquo;s relay by less than .2 seconds.&nbsp; The next event was the 200 
Freestyle where Greeley&rsquo;s Risten Clarke took the win.&nbsp; Next came the 
200 Individual Medley, where Greeley&rsquo;s Ian Cooper and Daniel DiGiacomo 
tied for first place!</p> 
<p>Greeley&rsquo;s Aaron Wald won the next event, Diving.&nbsp; Risten Clarke 
triumphed again, this time in the 100 Freestyle. The Greeley 200 Freestyle 
Relay team won their event as well. Greeley&rsquo;s Chris Koster won the next 
event, the 100 Backstroke.&nbsp; Lastly, the Aquamen out-swam Suffern in the 
400 Freestyle Relay.&nbsp; The overall score of the meet was 102 to 84, with 
Greeley coming out on top.<br>
<br>
 So far the Greeley Boys&rsquo; Swimming 
and Diving Team is undefeated with a 7-0 record for the season.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>by Jared Krosser</em></p> 
<p>After a huge win against Tappan Zee on Tuesday, December 20, 2011, the 
Greeley Boys&rsquo; Swim Team was at it again on Thursday, December 22, 2011, 
this time against Westlake High School.&nbsp; The Aquamen won in many of the 
events, including the 200 Medley Relay; 200 Freestyle; 50 Freestyle, Diving; 
100 Butterfly; 100 Freestyle; 500 Freestyle; 200 Freestyle Relay; and the 100 
Backstroke.&nbsp; By the end of the meet, the Greeley Aquamen had achieved a 
winning score of 95 to 83.&nbsp; Nick Scaglione, a first-year swimmer, raced in 
the 500 Freestyle and survived!</p> 
<h2>NEW: Greeley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aquamen&rdquo; beat Tappan Zee, last 
year&rsquo;s Sectional winners in neck-and-neck meet</h2> 
<p><em>by Jared Krosser</em></p> 
<p>The Horace Greeley boys&rsquo; swimming and diving team was very pumped for 
their second meet of the season on Tuesday, December 20 against Tappan Zee High 
School.&nbsp; After coming in second at Sectionals last year to Tappan Zee, the 
Aquamen were ready to &ldquo;give it all they got&rdquo; in Tuesday&rsquo;s 
competition.&nbsp; Greeley had the heart to win, but did they have the times?
</p> 
<p>In the first event, the 200 Medley Relay, Tappan Zee got off to a quick 
head start by taking first place. However, the Greeley boys were able to keep 
the score close by taking second and third places.&nbsp; The next event was the 
200 freestyle, where Greeley had a 1-2-3 finish by Risten Clarke, Aaron 
Saccurato and Aaron Blacker, respectively.&nbsp; In the 200 Individual Medley, 
Greeley&rsquo;s Ian Cooper took second place.&nbsp; In the 50 freestyle, 
Greeley&rsquo;s Henry Simon took another second place, finishing right behind 
Tappan Zee&rsquo;s swimmer. By this time in the meet, Greeley was barely 
beating Tappan Zee, 30 to 32.<br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 In an extremely close race, 
Greeley&rsquo;s Alex Smith finished first in the 100 Butterfly with an awesome 
performance. Following the 100 Butterfly was the 100 Freestyle, where 
Greeley&rsquo;s Risten Clarke took second place.&nbsp; At this point in the 
meet Greeley&rsquo;s lead had crept from two points to six points, 44 to 50.</p>
<p>Greeley&rsquo;s Aaron Saccurato finished first in the next event, the 500 
Freestyle.&nbsp; The 200 Freestyle Relay followed, and Greeley took both first 
and second places. In the next event, Greeley&rsquo;s Jared Krosser won the 100 
Breaststroke.&nbsp; By the end of the meet, Greeley had a total of 92 points 
while Tappan Zee only racked up 76. The 2011-12 Greeley boys&rsquo; swimming 
and diving team had beaten last year&rsquo;s Sectional winner by a substantial 
margin!</p> 
<p>The team has had two winning meets and no losses this season. Special 
thanks to Greeley swimming and diving team members Sky Jarrett and Matt Re for 
keeping score and taking photos throughout the meet.</p>

<h1>Board members decide to protest BOCES&rsquo; capital expenses by a 
&ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, but also to offer advice</h1> 
<p>January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>In their January 10 meeting, board of education members voted 
&ldquo;No&rdquo; to send a no-confidence message to BOCES and its proposed $18 
million capital improvement project, for which the CCSD, one of 18 member 
districts, would be billed a $1.5 million share.&nbsp; Members realize that 
their &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote may only result in BOCES returning to answer more 
questions, since the district is obliged to come up with the funds regardless.
</p> <br>

<p>Board members are still unhappy that the formula used to calculate its 
share of the $18 million makes use of property value and enrollment numbers yet 
ignores usage of the programs, which is low for CCSD.&nbsp; Their other concern 
is board members&rsquo; inability to judge whether BOCES&rsquo; plan is 
fiscally sound. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t presented a long term plan to 
us,&rdquo; said board member Karen Visser.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do we know that in 
ten years we won&rsquo;t be asked again?&rdquo; In addition, although the 
district&rsquo;s own debt is exempt from the tax cap, board members think it 
unfair and nonsensical that the debt they incur for the BOCES improvements is 
not.</p> 
<p>Board members made a point of proposing to meet with BOCES to provide input 
along with their &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We do value the shared services that BOCES provides,&rdquo; said 
board member Vicky Tipp, &ldquo;but we have a high level of obligation to our 
taxpayers and students, so a &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote doesn&rsquo;t mean 
&lsquo;No&rsquo; to contributing to capital improvement, but we have to do our 
due diligence.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In the end, said board member Randy Katchis, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll probably 
end in a &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; vote, but my &lsquo;No&rsquo; will be to start 
getting representation within that organization and get a process in 
place.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Board members did not specify what advice they would give BOCES, but in 
previous discussions Katchis has noted that it might be wise for BOCES to sell 
its current multiple-buildings campus and buy or lease other 
space&mdash;preferably a single building&mdash;that would cost less to 
maintain.&nbsp; He also suggested that rather than spend $3 million to upgrade 
an existing therapeutic pool, BOCES consider constructing a pool that would be 
of use to its member districts&rsquo; swimming programs (for which many pay for 
use of outside pools).</p> <br>

<p>At Brewster Ice Arena on Thursday night Horace Greeley hockey skated to a 
3-1 victory over Fox Lane.&nbsp; Greeley dominated play throughout, holding Fox 
Lane to just 14 shots on goal while they were able to put 35 shots on the Fox 
Lane goaltender.&nbsp; Blake Davis led the team with two goals and the defense 
continued its outstanding play.</p> <br>

<p>Greeley continued its ability to control play against weaker teams with a 
7-2 victory over Byram Hills on Friday night. Greg Krisberg notched a hat trick 
and Noah Ives and Jake Sandor also tallied for Greeley.&nbsp; Owen Gatto 
created many opportunities for his teammates, gathering 3 assists.</p> 
<p>Greeley takes off a week and is back on the ice on Friday Feb 3 in a 
rematch at Sport O Rama in Monsey, NY against Pearl River, who defeated Greeley 
earlier in the season 3-2 and then Shepaug at Brewster at 6:10 pm on Saturday 
Feb 4.</p> 
<p>With only four more games to go before playoffs the Greeley team will need 
to win its games against Pear River and later Ryetown/Harrison if they are to 
have a high seed when the playoffs begin.&nbsp; The defense led by Owen Gatto, 
Greg Krisberg, Henry Girardi and Dean Klien as well as a group of strong 
backchecking forwards have kept opposing players and pucks away form goaltender 
Neil Hershman this year.&nbsp; The team will need to score more goals if they 
are to advance deep in the playoffs next month.</p>

<h1>Greeley wrestlers beat Port Chester</h1>

Coach Mike DeBellis</em></p> 
<p>Horace Greeley came out victorious in a close match against league rival 
Port Chester, 39-37 on Thursday evening to secure second place in the league.
</p> <br>

<p>The match started with Greeley going down 12-0 due to forfeits in the 99 
and the 106 weight classes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>113-pounder Kirby Atlas stepped on the mat and beat senior, Captain Joey 
Rodriquez 3-2.&nbsp; It was a well-wrestled match by Kirby against a great Port 
Chester wrestler.</p> 
<p>Bing Bing Xie, 120 pounds, just came back from a knee injury to wrestle one 
of Port Chester&rsquo;s toughest wrestlers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he lost by pin 
in :55 seconds.</p> 
<p>Jon Russo, 126 pounds, disposed of Dan Dipippo in 1:26.&nbsp; Jon&rsquo;s 
wrestling has been improving throughout the season and he is peaking at the 
right time.</p> 
<p>Freshman Elijah Kim filled in at 132 pounds and lost by pin to Odell 
Alexander in :49 seconds.</p> 
<p>At 138 pounds, Kolbe Jendzejec came up huge for the team by pinning 
Giovanni Borrayes in 5:34.&nbsp; Kolbe had the match of his life.&nbsp; He was 
down by several points with a minute left in the match and turned his opponent 
to his back for the pin.&nbsp; Some guys just compete better when all the 
pressure is on them.&nbsp; Kolbe is one of those people.</p> 
<p>Mike Orbeta at 145 pounds had a tough loss by decision 7-12. </p> 
<p>Liam Mercer also had a hard fought battle at 152 pounds and lost by 
decision 4-16.</p> 
<p>Mike Nadler bumped up a weight class to wrestle at 160 pounds and lost by 
decision 7-12.</p> 
<p>Freshman Brock Cvijanovich continues to wrestle like an 
upperclassman.&nbsp; He wrestled his heart out and had his opponent on his back 
several times but could not put him away.&nbsp; He ended up losing a close 
decision 12-15.</p> 
<p>Sam Tugendhaft received a forfeit at 182 pounds. </p> 
<p>We needed three pins from our last three weight classes to win the match 
and our heavyweights swept the rest of the way.</p> 
<p>Billy Marino, 195 pounds, wrestled Jimmy Lopez and pinned him in 3:36. </p> 
<p>Scott Wymbs bumped up to 220 pounds and received a forfeit. </p> 
<p>It all came down to Brent Lobien at 285 pounds.&nbsp; Brent shot a great 
double leg in the first period and put Christian Zamano on his back and pinned 
him in 1:09.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This was a great win for Greeley, propelling us to a 17-6 record for the 
year.&nbsp; Our next competition will be this weekend in the Beacon Tournament.
</p> 
<p>Our next home meet is on <strong>Wednesday, February 1st at 4:30 p.m.
</strong> in the main gym against our rival Pleasantville.&nbsp; We will also 
be honoring our seniors and their parents that night.&nbsp; We would love to 
see you there.</p>

<h1>Boys&rsquo; Basketball Quakers notch 62-42 victory over Port Chester Rams
</h1> 
<p>January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Brian Rosen</em><br>
<br>
 In avenging its only 
two league losses from last year, the Greeley Boys&rsquo; varsity basketball 
team rumbled past the Port Chester Rams on Wednesday evening, 62-42.&nbsp; 
Harrison Brown and Justin Ciero led the Greeley scoring with 21 points and 12 
points, respectively.&nbsp; Teddy Graves continued his strong play contributing 
10 points, three steals and five rebounds.</p> <br>

<p>Port Chester jumped off to a 4-0 lead, but it was all Greeley after 
that.&nbsp; The Quakers finished the first quarter up 15-4 and widened the gap 
to 33-16 at the half.&nbsp; After the third period, Greeley was up by 26 
points, 51-25.&nbsp; The lead allowed some younger players to get some 
meaningful playing time; Jake Ault netted the first two points of his varsity 
career.<br>

<p><strong>NEW: Greeley boys&rsquo; basketball team wins barnburner in 
overtime against Peekskill, 76-75</strong></p> 
<p><em>by Brian Rosen </em><br>
<br>
 The Greeley Quakers won a heart-stopping 
overtime thriller, 76-75, on Saturday January 14 against the Peekskill Red 
Devils.<br>
<br>
 The Quakers raced out to 17-11 lead by the end of the first 
quarter.&nbsp; Greeley was paced by 11 points by Justin Ciero and a long-range 
bomb by Connor Domershick.&nbsp; But by the end of two quarters, the Peekskill 
Red Devils had drawn to 35-30.&nbsp; During the second quarter, Greeley pounded 
the ball inside to Harrison Brown and received strong support from a timely 
Brett Klein three and aggressive play by Teddy Graves and Cole Benack.<br>
<br>

 The third quarter saw Peekskill continue to advance on Greeley and actually 
take the lead on several occasions. But the Quakers hung tough and at the end 
of the third quarter still led, 49-48.&nbsp; Although outscored in the quarter, 
18-14, Greeley consistently broke the Red Devils&rsquo; full court press and 
aggressively defended and out-rebounded Peekskill.&nbsp; This bode well for the 
final quarter and the overtime period that followed.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Both sides run up the score in the fourth</strong></em><br>
<br>
 During the fourth quarter, baskets came quickly for both sides with Greeley 
relying heavily on Brown inside and Ciero from the outside.&nbsp; With only 
seven seconds remaining, Greeley enjoyed a three-point lead.&nbsp; The Red 
Devils inbounded the ball and hit a three-pointer from the left wing to knot 
the game and send it into overtime.&nbsp; The shot drove the hometown crowd 
into pandemonium.<br>
<br>
 But the Quakers were undaunted.&nbsp; The lead 
changed hands several times during the overtime period and Greeley found itself 
down by two near the end.&nbsp; Then Josh Rosen dribbled around his defender 
and, with only six seconds left, threw a &ldquo;no look&rdquo; pass to Brown 
underneath, who converted the easy lay-up for the lead and the ultimate victory.
<br> <br>
 Harrison Brown finished with 34 points and Justin Ciero contributed 
21.</p>

<h1>Greeley boys&rsquo; basketball team drops a pair to nearby rivals Byram 
Hills and Fox Lane</h1> 
<p><strong>Next Home Game:&nbsp; TONIGHT, Friday, January 20, 7:00 p.m. 
against Harrison</strong><br>
<br>
 January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Rich Klein and 
Brian Rosen</em><br>
<br>
 In two highly competitive games, the Greeley Quakers 
played the Byram Hills Bobcats on Tuesday, January 10 and the Fox Lane Foxes on 
Friday, January 6, but came up short 58-54 and 74-64, respectively.</p> <br>

<p><em><strong>Road trip to Armonk ends in disappointment</strong></em><br>

<br> On Tuesday, January 10, the Greeley Quakers traveled to Armonk to take on 
the Bobcats. Byram Hills took command early and, in the blink of an eye, raced 
out to a 10-0 lead on two three-pointers and a layup off an alley-oop 
pass.&nbsp; The Bobcats extended their lead to 16-2 before the Quakers steadied 
themselves with a layup by Harrison Brown. Then Brett Klein provided an 
immediate spark off the bench by taking a charge, and Greeley closed the first 
quarter with a three by Justin Ciero and a three-point play by Brown to narrow 
the gap to 18-10.<br>
<br>
 Greeley continued its comeback in the second 
quarter with Matt Xie, in his first game of the season after sustaining a 
pre-season injury, powering to the hoop for a layup and Klein nailing a three 
to cut the lead to five at 20-15.&nbsp; Ryan Lubarsky contributed to the surge, 
converting a fast break layup and two free throws, and the Greeley defense 
continued its intensity. Two consecutive steals led to easy points for the 
Quakers, one by Brown and another by Teddy Graves, bringing Greeley to within 
three points of the lead.&nbsp; At halftime, the Quakers were still down three, 
30-27.<br>
<br>
 In the opening minute of the third quarter, a jumper by Ciero 
made it a one-point game, which energized the Greeley fans.&nbsp; But the 
Bobcats stormed back, going on an 8-0 run. Greeley regained control of the game 
with its own 16-2 run.&nbsp; After Connor Domershick hit a three, Josh Rosen 
converted a layup off a steal and then hit a three to tie the game with a 
minute and a half left in the third quarter.&nbsp; The Quakers closed the 
quarter on a high note, with Brown making a layup, Ciero nailing another three 
and Brown tipping in a shot off a missed jumper.&nbsp; Greeley led 45-40 at the 
end of the third period.<br>
<br>
 The final quarter started well for Greeley 
with Brown hitting a fast break layup and then two free throws, but then it 
unraveled for the Quakers.&nbsp; The Bobcats proceeded to go on an 11-0 run and 
regained the lead, 53-49.&nbsp; There was no quit in Greeley, though, as Brown 
made a free throw, a driving layup, and then two more free throws, and the 
Quakers only trailed by one, 55-54, with 1:30 remaining.&nbsp; The final dagger 
came on a Byram Hills three with under a minute left, resulting in the 58-54 
win for the Bobcats.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Despite packed house at January 6 home game, Quakers go down in 
defeat</strong></em><br>
<br>
 Friday night, January 6, before a packed house 
in the Greeley gym, the Quakers and the Foxes faced off in another rivalry 
game.&nbsp; Although Greeley started off strong and the game was close 
throughout, this time, it was just too much Trawick, Will Trawick, that 
is.&nbsp; The Fox Lane senior power forward hit jumpers, layups and did 
everything else necessary to secure the 10-point victory.&nbsp; Trawick scored 
37 points shooting 19 for 23 from the field.<br>

<h1>Destination: Haiti . . .&nbsp; Mission: Build Six Homes</h1> 
<p>January 20, 2012<br>
<em>by Hugh Sigmon</em></p> 
<p>We all have the natural tendency to block out horrible news, political 
strife and economic corruption. We think: What can I, one person, do?&nbsp; 
Well, there is something you can do to help.&nbsp; It may be a very simple, 
two-home duplex &mdash; 14 by 20 feet, poured concrete and block walls with a 
metal roof &mdash; but if you and your family have been living in a makeshift 
tent city for two years, it is a dream come true.</p> <br>

<p><strong>One Small House</strong>, based in Brewster, N.Y., will send three 
teams in the spring of 2012 to Haiti to build simple, decent homes for families 
displaced by the devastating earthquake of January 2010.<strong>One Small House
</strong> has been building homes in rural Mexico for the past decade. Several 
members of the Presbyterian Church of Mount Kisco along with Interim Pastor 
Jack Lohr will join the first and second Haiti trips, scheduled for March 
11-17, and March 25 - 31, 2012.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We will not be building temporary shelters, but permanent homes, 
designed to withstand earthquakes and category 4 hurricanes, and positioned to 
be at the center of a new community,&rdquo; says team leader Dave Dobson and 
member of the Presbyterian Church of Mount Kisco. Prior to the 7.0 earthquake 
that killed an estimated 300,000 in January 2010, Haiti was the poorest nation 
in the Western Hemisphere. Afterward, conditions became immeasurably 
worse.&nbsp; However, progress has been made. Rubble has been cleared. 
Rebuilding has begun, and some people have moved out of their temporary 
quarters and returned home.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Give elbow grease or donate money</strong></em></p> 
<p>Those interested in assisting the local team by supporting the purchase of 
building materials for the project can make donations through PayPal on the OSH 
web site:www.onesmallhouse.org/ or by check payable to One Small House, 5001 
Stonecrest Drive, Brewster, N.Y.</p> 
<p>Donations by check must be accompanied by a form downloaded from the OSH 
web site. So that PCMK receives credit for the donation, &ldquo;Team 
PCMK&rdquo; should appear on the designation line and the trip ID March 11 
&ndash; 90028 should be included.</p> 
<p>One Small House work teams will be in Haiti, March 11-17, March 25-31 and 
April 8-14. Those interested in joining a mission trip can register at
www.onesmallhouse.org/.</p> 
<p>Help move these families out of tents and into real homes!</p> 
<p><em>Hugh Sigmon is a member of the Presbyterian Church of Mount 
Kisco.&nbsp; Sigmon and his wife, Paula Wiles Sigmon, are part of the first

<h1>Merchant of the Week: Do-it-yourselfer JoAnn Virag of Millwood Hardware
</h1> 
<p><br>
 Tuesday, January 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>Last week, I spoke with Millwood Hardware owner JoAnn Virag, who took over 
the store from her father in the late 80&rsquo;s.</p> <br>

<p><strong>(1) How long have you and your hardware store been a member of our 
community?</strong></p> 
<p>Millwood Hardware has been a member of the community since 1968.&nbsp; 
Without giving away my age, I&rsquo;ve worked here my whole life,&nbsp; I took 
the store over from my dad in the late 1980&rsquo;s and have been running it 
ever since.</p> 
<p><strong>(2) At the risk of being politically incorrect, I think it&rsquo;s 
safe to say that you&rsquo;re in a field mostly dominated by men, what sparked 
your interest in this area?</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, this is a field that is still dominated by men.&nbsp; Luckily for me, 
that did not stop my father from involving me in the business.&nbsp; I loved 
working at the store, whenever needed.&nbsp; This included after school, snow 
days, vacations and summer breaks.&nbsp; Anyone who has ever worked in a family 
business can relate.&nbsp; My hardware knowledge and interest comes from 
helping my father build our family home on his time off.&nbsp; I loved helping 
him hands-on.&nbsp; Since he worked six days a week, this construction project 
went on for quite some time.&nbsp; Then when I bought my first home, I intended 
to just do a little remodeling but ended up gutting the house.&nbsp; I truly 
enjoy the hands-on aspect of fixing and/or building something.&nbsp; I love 
when a customer comes in and asks for help.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m able to base it on 
first-hand experiences.<br>
<br>
<strong>(3) You are next to a New Castle 
landmark&mdash;Rocky&rsquo;s&mdash;does your location help business?</strong>
</p> 
<p>Being next to Rocky&rsquo;s Deli definitely helps!&nbsp; Since they are 
such a landmark, many times when people call for directions, we can easily use 
Rocky&rsquo;s as a point of reference.&nbsp; We often get customers who come in 
to wander as their order is being filled.<br>
<br>
<strong>(4) What makes your 
store different than a box store like Home Depot?</strong></p> 
<p>I think what differentiates us from the big box stores is our customer 
service, our friendliness and our knowledge of hardware.&nbsp; We try to greet 
each customer that comes in, see what they need help with and then guide them 
towards a solution.&nbsp; In our 44 years of being a part of this community, we 
have developed a lot of friendships. But I also hope we have developed a 
reputation that you can come to us with your project, no matter how big or how 
small, and we will have what you need and show you how to use all of it.&nbsp; 
I frequently hear customers comment about the wide variety of merchandise we 
carry.&nbsp; We also try to keep the store well organized and clean, making it 
an welcoming environment.&nbsp; And, of course, our staff is knowledgeable, 
friendly and helpful.&nbsp; Over the summer, we hope to do an interior 
remodel.&nbsp; This will give us a face lift and hopefully find room for new 
product lines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>(5) Does your inventory change a lot with 
the seasons?</strong></p> 
<p>Absolutely.&nbsp; We are a seasonal business.&nbsp; Around the holidays, we 
carry holiday decorations, and everything you need to spruce up your house for 
guests.&nbsp; During the winter, there is<em>usually </em>a need for ice melt, 
snow shovels, and fireplace supplies.&nbsp; Spring time brings all the 
merchandise you need for spring clean-up and home repair.&nbsp; We carry items 
for yard work including grass seed, fertilizers, hoses, sprinklers and 
gardening tools.&nbsp; And for your barbecuing we carry Weber grills, parts and 
accessories.&nbsp; If the Weber grill you&rsquo;re looking for is not in the 
store, we can order the model you want.&nbsp; The fall is for all those 
projects you put off all summer long, because you were relaxing and 
enjoying.&nbsp; Projects that need tending before the cold winter hits.&nbsp; 
We also carry a wide variety of homewares throughout the year.<br>
<br>
<strong>
(6) What&rsquo;s the benefit of your affiliation with True Value?</strong></p> 
<p>By being a member of True Value, we&rsquo;re able to purchase from their 
warehouse instead of direct from the manufacturers.&nbsp; This allows us to 
carry a wider breadth of merchandise.&nbsp; It also enables us to get more 
competitive pricing as True Value has the buying power of 4,000 stores.&nbsp; 
We are now a proud carrier of Benjamin Moore paints, and, of course, we carry 
True Value paints. They will also provide professional merchandisers to help 
with the layout of the merchandise.&nbsp; They even have a store design 
division.&nbsp; In fact, they are drawing up our remodeling plans.<br>
<br>

<strong>(7) What do you think the town could do to make conditions better for 
business in Millwood?</strong></p> 
<p>I love being a part of a small community&mdash;this community!&nbsp; But 
sometimes I wish New Castle would put more emphasis on Millwood, not just 
Chappaqua.&nbsp; I feel we have a lot to offer, and sometimes we&rsquo;re 
forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>(8) Do you do a lot of special orders?</strong>
</p> 
<p>We do a <em>lot</em> of special orders.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re 
confined by our space.&nbsp; The store is about 5,000 square feet and we have 
over 7,000 square feet of storage.&nbsp; As I said earlier, we try to carry a 
wide range of products and a blend of what our customers are looking for.&nbsp; 
But only so much will fit.&nbsp; And this is another advantage of being a 
member of True Value, we can order anything out of their catalog.&nbsp; If 
it&rsquo;s in stock, we&rsquo;ll have it in days.&nbsp; The customer comes in, 
and if it&rsquo;s not what they want, we&rsquo;ll simply ship it back&mdash;no 
obligations.&nbsp; Hopefully the remodel will help us create more shelf space.

<h1>Occupy Wall Street: The First Season</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>With 47 comments since publication</strong><br>
 January 13, 
2012<br>
<em>by William Gerrard</em></p> 
<p>The first time I attended an Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protest was the march 
on October 1, which ended with the arrest of more than 700 people on the 
Brooklyn Bridge. The encampment at Zuccotti Park was barely two weeks old, and 
there was no broader Occupy movement yet to speak of.</p> <br>

<p>I had supported the protesters from the sidelines before the march, despite 
(or perhaps because of) how flailing they appeared at first&mdash;but I might 
not have been inspired to come out to the bridge that day had it not been for 
the infamous video of Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna pepper spraying 
non-violent female protesters a week earlier.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Police brutality at protests has been a dominant topic in the OWS 
conversation, and in one sense that&rsquo;s unfortunate: as individuals, the 
police have a lot more in common with the protesters than with 
pension-defrauding bankers and corrupt politicians. But that pepper-spray 
video, and all of the many images of even worse violence against protesters 
since then, did get a lot of people mad. And if you want things to change, as 
Howard Beale says in<em>Network</em>, mad is the first thing you&rsquo;ve got 
to get.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;You are your own media.&rdquo;</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>While the protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge were still trapped and waiting 
their turn to be arrested, their comrades were deliberating as a group back at 
Zuccotti Park about what could be done to help them. The meeting took the form 
of a leaderless &ldquo;general assembly,&rdquo; OWS&rsquo;s primary vehicle for 
making decisions, where actions are agreed upon by consensus and all attendees 
have their own voice&mdash;a micro-model of a<em>participatory</em> (as opposed 
to<em>representative</em>) democracy.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>After a certain point, the live video streams coming from the bridge 
protesters stopped broadcasting; and since the mainstream media had yet to 
start paying serious attention to OWS, there was no way for anyone who 
wasn&rsquo;t standing on or near the bridge to see what was happening.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As a solution, a young man suggested that the smartphone users in the crowd 
download one of the several applications which allow cell phones to broadcast 
live video, then head to the bridge to establish a feed. If the news networks 
weren&rsquo;t going to provide live coverage of hundreds of people being 
arrested over the course of several hours on the Brooklyn Bridge, ordinary 
people would step up and do it themselves.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&ldquo;You are your own media,&rdquo; he declared to all.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I searched for, found, downloaded, and installed Bambuser, a free 
live-streaming app for mobile devices&mdash;the whole process took less than a 
minute&mdash;then made my way back to the bridge with a few other volunteers. 
By now, there was a wall of police blocking the entrance, so we had to stand 
across Centre Street, yards away from City Hall. I started broadcasting the 
scene, which quickly escalated as hundreds of marchers arrived to stage a 
sympathy protest for the arrestees.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I could see that the number of viewers watching my live feed began to rise: 
slowly at first, by the dozens, then by the hundreds. Messages and questions 
from viewers started popping up on my screen&mdash;&ldquo;how many 
arrests?&rdquo;; &ldquo;kudos from portugal&rdquo;; &ldquo;me too from 
italy&rdquo;&mdash;to which I could respond by talking into the phone&rsquo;s 
mic.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Within half an hour of arriving at the bridge&mdash;and having just joined 
the movement earlier that day&mdash;I found myself &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; the 
event for thousands of people. It felt as though I had entered both a new era 
of media and a new era of politics at the same time; and it seemed as if those 
two eras were inextricably linked: a &ldquo;do-it-yourself media,&rdquo; with 
news-event witnesses bypassing corporate editorial biases and providing their 
own live news coverage, in the service of a &ldquo;do-it-yourself 
politics,&rdquo; with citizens bypassing their unresponsive (or irresponsible) 
representatives and taking to the streets to represent themselves.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>&rdquo;Eviction in Progress&rdquo;</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>That powerful interests understand OWS to be an unacceptable threat to the 
status quo&mdash;socialism for the super-rich, sink-or-swim capitalism for 
everyone else&mdash;was made clear a month and a half later when cities across 
the country launched a coordinated campaign to crush the (mostly) peaceable 
Occupy assemblies, which had spread rapidly after the mass arrests that day on 
the bridge.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>On November 15, at 1:03 a.m., I received a text message that read, 
&ldquo;URGENT: Hundreds of police mobilizing around Zuccotti. Eviction in 
progress!&rdquo; (I had signed up to receive the Zuccotti Park &ldquo;eviction 
defense text blast.&rdquo;) When Mayor Bloomberg and the NYPD first tried to 
clear Zuccotti of occupiers a month earlier, they had announced their plan days 
in advance, giving the OWS organizers time to mobilize a large number of 
supporters and to jam the park with bodies. That mistake would not be repeated.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>By the time I arrived downtown, the police had already erected a cordon of 
metal barriers in a two to four block radius around the park, preventing the 
hundreds of people who had shown up in solidarity&mdash;despite the late hour 
and lack of forewarning&mdash;from getting any closer. Though the pretext for 
the barriers was that the area was &ldquo;unsafe,&rdquo; the police were 
permitting civilian vehicular traffic to enter&mdash;leading one woman within 
earshot of me to observe wryly that we could all get to the park if we just 
took taxis.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Though she was kidding, I thought it was actually a pretty good idea, so I 
jogged around the cordon perimeter and hailed a cab. When I confessed to the 
driver that my plan was to circumvent the police barricades in order to get 
closer to the park, he was game to help.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The police parted the barricades for us, warily but dutifully. As we grazed 
the east side of the park coming down Broadway, I slid out the door and started 
broadcasting with my phone&mdash;though by now, at 2:00 a.m., only a handful of 
viewers tuned in. The park and the surrounding area had already been scrubbed 
clean of civilians, save for a few street vendors with no customers.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Inside Zuccotti, sanitation workers and police were busy breaking down the 
occupiers&rsquo; tents and makeshift structures and throwing them into bins, 
which were then dumped into a waiting convoy of trucks.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I had about three minutes in which to observe this well-planned, extremely 
efficient operation before I was spotted by a cop, who made it clear that what 
I was doing&mdash;standing on a public sidewalk, filming public employees from 
across the street as they performed public business in a public park&mdash;was 
not allowed, not tonight. He ordered me to retreat behind a mini-barricade half 
a block away.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As I moved to comply, several police officers clad in riot gear carried a 
non-resisting young woman by her limp limbs toward the same barricade and 
placed her safely behind the metal barriers, where a now-former occupier helped 
her to her feet. The moment she righted herself, one of the riot police took a 
quick jab at her face over the barrier as though she were a punching bag, then 
casually walked away while his fellow officers guarded us. The former occupier 
shielded her after the blow and held her for a brief moment as she recovered. 
Neither of them said anything.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>There were eight other people with me in that little security pen, some of 
them wearing press passes and complaining that the police were preventing them 
from doing their jobs. The NYPD was creating a de facto media blackout, which 
they clearly felt allowed them to operate with impunity. I spoke with another 
former occupier who fled the park shortly before the police arrived out of fear 
that they would use tear gas; she had severe asthma, she said, and was afraid 
that she might have a potentially life-threatening asthma attack amid the 
confusion.&nbsp; The police reportedly used tear gas toward the end of the raid.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Other guests joined us periodically, including a female bicyclist whom an 
officer had placed in a painful headlock, and another journalist whose visible 
credentials did not spare him from police harassment. Civilians in Afghanistan 
(and, until recently, Iraq) are routinely subjected to surprise night raids by 
U.S. military forces looking for insurgents&mdash;yet there we were, in Lower 
Manhattan, in the middle of the night, being treated by a para-militarized 
domestic police force as if we were potential enemies rather than peaceful 
citizens. When Bloomberg said two weeks later that the NYPD was his 
&ldquo;private army,&rdquo; everyone who witnessed the Zuccotti eviction knew 
that he was only half-joking.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>Foreclosure Tour</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As it turns out, by removing the protesters from Zuccotti Park, the 
Bloomberg administration may very well have done OWS a favor. As symbolically 
important as the occupation was, it was also a liability to the movement going 
forward: small business owners in the neighborhood were mobilizing their own 
protest against the constant disruptions; a few reports of crime within the 
encampment were creating negative publicity; and a punishing New York winter, 
perhaps only weeks away, threatened to thin the ranks of the occupiers. 
Bloomberg spared OWS a potential Napoleonic-style winter retreat, and handed 
them an Alamo around which to rally. The eviction has compelled the occupiers 
to extend their organizational reach and their demands for economic justice 
outward, into the very neighborhoods that have been hardest hit by the economic 
crash.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>On December 6th, as part of a national day of action against 
America&rsquo;s housing crisis, OWS worked with local community activist groups 
to conduct a &ldquo;foreclosure tour&rdquo; through the East New York 
neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the foreclosure rate is five times higher than 
the state average. Hundreds of people joined the march, which paused at boarded 
up, bank-owned houses along the way so that foreclosure victims could stand 
before the crowd and share their stories of life in 21st century America: 
predatory lenders, no health insurance, children killed in Iraq.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>One of the most radical gestures of the Occupy movement has been to 
transform everyday spaces&mdash;parks, squares, sidewalks, bridges&mdash;into 
empathetic forums where private suffering becomes a public concern. With 
Zuccotti and the other centralized Occupy camps shut down one by one, these 
sorts of demilitarized zones within the economic war of all against 
all&mdash;where the spirit of cooperation and sharing survives amid the general 
reign of greed and fiscal austerity&mdash;are free to proliferate.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em><strong>&rdquo;I&rsquo;ve got his back.&rdquo;</strong></em></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Contrast OWS&rsquo; manner of speaking to people&mdash;and of encouraging 
them to speak for themselves&mdash;with that of the modern political campaign. 
Consider, for example, President Obama&rsquo;s new reelection poster: 
It&rsquo;s an image of the back of Obama&rsquo;s head, in front of an old Gap 
commercial-style white void containing the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got his 
back.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the text refers to you, a putative Obama supporter; 
and your pre-assigned role in the 2012 election drama is to express solidarity 
with the most powerful person on the planet&mdash;a man who isn&rsquo;t even 
looking in your direction. The poster makes no mention of whether he has our 
back; whether, for example, heavily indebted Americans might one day receive 
the same kind of &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; protection against catastrophic 
financial loss as do rich, well-connected firms like Goldman Sachs and 
Citigroup. (Though extra verbiage about reciprocal back-getting would probably 
have spoiled the poster&rsquo;s sleek design.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Rather than waiting patiently for their Wall Street-financed leaders to 
experience Saul-to-Paul conversions in limos en route to $30,000-a-plate 
fundraisers, ordinary Americans are taking the initiative and finding novel 
ways to help each other.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The final destination of the Brooklyn &ldquo;foreclosure tour&rdquo; was 
702 Vermont Street, a property vacant for three years&mdash;until now, as a 
homeless family, with the help of OWS and other community activists, was moving 
in without permission of the owner, Bank of America. This was against the law, 
of course. But since Bank of America (along with most of the country&rsquo;s 
other largest banks) has been accused of committing mass foreclosure fraud, it 
felt less like trespassing than like a small step toward restitution. As of the 
time of this writing, the family is still occupying their new home, and more 
property reclamations are in the works across the country. With the number of 
people who have been illegally thrown out of their homes potentially in the 
tens or hundreds of thousands, OWS will have plenty to do through the winter.

<h1>INTEL Semi-finalist Emily Prentiss, 18-year-old senior at Ossining HS</h1> 
<p><br>
 Tuesday, January 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s Note:</em> After publishing Two New Castle high school 
seniors are Intel semi-finalists last Friday, <em>NCNOW</em> made a big 
discovery: Among the Ossining High School INTEL semi-finalists, there was a 
third New Castle resident, 18-year-old senior Emily Prentiss, pictured above 
(second from the right) with classmates Amelia Clements, Evan Olin (also of New 
Castle) and Frances Russell.</p> <br>

<p>Each of the 300 semi-finalists receives a $1,000 award, each school $1,000 
for each of its semi-finalist students.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Next steps</strong></em> from the Intel Newsroom</p> 
<p>&ldquo;On Jan. 25, 40 of the 300 semifinalists will be named as finalists. 
They will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington, D.C. from March 
8-13. There, they will compete for more than $630,000 in awards provided by the 
Intel Foundation. Winners will be selected based on rigorous judging sessions 
and announced at a black-tie gala award ceremony at the National Building 
Museum on March 13. The top award is $100,000; the remaining top 10 will 
receive awards totaling $305,000.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>NCNOW interviewed Ms. Prentiss over the weekend about her research project.
</p> 
<p><strong>Will you describe your research project for us?</strong></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s really about the way the brain responds to stimuli we&rsquo;re 
not really paying attention to.&nbsp; For example, if you&rsquo;re hearing a 
regular &ldquo;beep,&rdquo; &ldquo;beep,&rdquo; &ldquo;beep,&rdquo; going on 
and then instead a &ldquo;boop&rdquo; occurs, your brain notices the 
change.&nbsp; Or you notice the sound of a siren, because it&rsquo;s unexpected 
and it occurs in the ambient.&nbsp; Or you&rsquo;re in a room and someone 
touches you from behind.&nbsp; You notice it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a distinct 
way the brain reacts to those changes and we can measure it.</p> 
<p><strong>How did you measure these changes?</strong></p> 
<p>I used an electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor the brainwaves of seven 
normal adult subjects as they watched a movie.&nbsp; Each of the the subjects 
was holding a mechanism in each hand.&nbsp; We sent vibrations mainly to the 
right hand, then occasionally to the left instead, then analyzed the data. We 
found that the brain responds in 172 milliseconds (one-fifth of a second) after 
the stimulus is presented.</p> 
<p><strong>What can be done with the knowledge that these changes are 
measurable?</strong></p> 
<p>The paradigm I invented would be ideal for monitoring the recovery process 
of a stroke patient, for example.&nbsp; The task could be administered on a 
weekly basis.&nbsp; It would be inexpensive and non-invasive.</p> 
<p>The paradigm also gives engineers and people designing crash warning 
systems a useful tool&mdash;for example, in fancy cars where they have a crash 
warning system to tell you you&rsquo;ve departed from your lane or when 
you&rsquo;re too close to another car.&nbsp; These systems usually use an 
auditory or visual alert.&nbsp; But when you&rsquo;re driving, you&rsquo;re 
already using your ears and eyes and such a warning system might cause you to 
look to the right or left when you should be looking at the road.&nbsp; So 
implementing a tactile alert, such as vibrations in the steering wheel, might 
be more effective.</p> 
<p><strong>Emily Prentiss</strong><br>
 Research Project: The Right Hand Knows 
What the Left Hand Does: High-Density Electrical Recording of Human 
Somatosensory Change Detection<br>
 Science research teachers: Angelo 
Piccirillo and Valerie Holmes<br>
 Mentor: Dr. John Butler from the Cognitive 
Neurophysiology Lab at Albert Einstein College of Medicine</p> 
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
<p>Automatic change detection is a fundamental function of the human brain. It 
is the process by which the brain detects minute changes in ambient stimuli, 
regardless of where attention is directed. While it is widely accepted that 
this function exists, very few studies have ever quantified this function using 
electrophysiology or mathematical models in the somatosensory domain. Thus, 
this study focused on quantifying this function using electroencephalography 
(EEG) and an advanced mathematical analysis method, as well as developing a 
paradigm that would enable us to measure the function exclusively and 
effectively. This study used Mismatch Negativity (MMN) as a change detection 
measure in conjunction with stimuli delivered through an oddball paradigm, in 
which a stream of standard frequent stimuli is interrupted with a deviant 
infrequent stimulus. Seven healthy adult subjects completed the experiment. 
Somatosensory stimulation was delivered to the left and the right hands. 
Event-related potentials (ERP - automatic, event-driven brain responses) were 
recorded and measured using high- density EEG covering the entire scalp. Upon 
analysis, we epoched the standard and deviant data (took small sections from 
continuous data), leaving 100ms of pre-stimulus recording, and 500ms of 
post-stimulus recording. On average, change detection occurred 172ms after 
stimulus presentation within the post-central gyrus across all subjects. The 
MMN is rapidly becoming an important tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of 
certain disorders. Thus, the results of this study represent an important 
addition to literature, as they provide both an easily repeated paradigm as 
well as a definite metric with which to compare healthy automatic change 
detection with the abnormal processing habits of clinical populations.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a runner.&nbsp; Cross-country in fall and track in spring.&nbsp; 
In freshman year I sustained an injury in cross country, tendinitis in my 
knees. Then in spring track, stress fractures.&nbsp; So I was interested in 
running injuries and started talking to my mentor about this new trend of 
barefoot running.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of attention in the media on, for example, Vibram 
Five Fingers, minimalist footware that&rsquo;s essentially the same as barefoot 
running.&nbsp; It just protects you from rocks and nails.&nbsp; Sales have been 
increasing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a change in mechanics involved in barefoot running: Instead 
of running with the heel hitting first, the ball of the foot hits first, then 
you bring down the heel.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a completely different running 
style.&nbsp; Because it&rsquo;s so different, it&rsquo;s something the body 
isn&rsquo;t used to and the transition period from one to the other had never 
been looked at.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Do barefoot runners sustain fewer injuries?</strong></em></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s based on the idea that it would be less injurious.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s speculated, but research needs to be done.&nbsp; The idea is that in 
developing, human being have run without shoes.&nbsp; And in countries where 
they don&rsquo;t have ready access to shoes, like in Kenya, they seem to have 
fewer injuries.</p> 
<p><em><strong>In runners who compete?</strong></em></p> 
<p>In both kinds of runners&mdash;those who compete and those who run because 
their life requires them to run places.</p> 
<p><em><strong>So you looked at what happens in transitioning from 
&ldquo;shod&rdquo; (with shoes) running to barefoot running.&nbsp; What happens?
</strong></em></p> 
<p>Initially, there were three things: tibial shock, muscle activity and knee 
flexion angle.&nbsp; Based on changes observed, it&rsquo;s more likely that a 
runner would experience an injury before they acclimate to barefoot 
running.&nbsp; If they just suddenly jump into it, there&rsquo;s a greater 
likelihood of injury than if they&rsquo;d just kept running shod.</p> 
<p>The idea is that with knowledge about this transition, people will take it 
in increments, not just go out and run five miles barefoot, but instead maybe 
run half a mile barefoot and the rest in shoes.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Do you run barefoot?</strong></em></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried it a few times, but it doesn&rsquo;t really work for the 
way I run.&nbsp; The way I run, my stride doesn&rsquo;t really match up.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m fairly tall, and with barefoot strides, you take a shorter stride 
because of a change in the ankle.&nbsp; Because you hit on the ball of the 
foot, you end up having to cut off a little of the extension you would take to 
land on your heel.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Initial Transition from Shod to Barefoot Running Generates 
Increased Tibial Shock and Muscle Activation&rdquo;<br>
 by Evan Olin</p> 
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
<p><em>Running is a highly injurious activity, and as a potential means to 
decrease this risk of injury, many runners are transitioning into barefoot 
running. This requires that habitually shod runners learn to change their 
foot-strike patterns from a heel-strike to a toe-strike technique. This study 
aimed to evaluate the biomechanical risks during the initial transition from 
shod to barefoot running. Eighteen habitually shod recreational runners ran for 
three separate seven minute trials, including shod heel-strike, barefoot 
heel-strike, and barefoot toe-strike conditions. For the barefoot toe-strike 
condition, subjects were instructed on proper technique. Electromyography 
(EMG), tibial shock, and knee flexion angle were monitored using bipolar 
surface electrodes, an accelerometer, and an electrogoniometer respectively. 
Data were collected and averaged over the 2nd, 4th, and 6th minute of each 
trial. A one-way MANOVA revealed that average EMG of the medial gastrocnemius 
(p=0.05), average and peak tibial shock (p&lt;0.01), and the minimum knee 
flexion angle (p&lt;0.01) all increased from shod (heel-strike) to barefoot 
(toe- strike) running. While it has been suggested that barefoot, toe-strike 
running may ultimately be less injurious, these data indicate that the 
transition into barefoot running presents a high risk period for 
musculoskeletal injury to the lower extremities. Therefore, habitually shod, 
heel- striking runners who choose to transition into a barefoot, toe-strike 
technique must undertake the process cautiously and with knowledge on proper 
toe-strike mechanics to avoid increasing their risk of injury.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>How did you choose your research subject?</strong></em></p> 
<p>For a while I&rsquo;d been taking meditation classes and have been very 
interested in the spiritual aspect of the mind.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;d been 
thinking for a while of investigating how the conscious and the unconscious 
mind relate to one another and the scientific basis behind it.</p> 
<p><em><strong>What did you learn from your research?</strong></em></p> 
<p>I found out that what we call intuition is primarily deductive.&nbsp; That 
is, there&rsquo;s a lot of different approaches one can take to solve a 
problem&mdash;pattern-based, self-observation, memory&mdash;but it turns out 
that the way most people solve a problem is by using logical deduction.&nbsp; 
But at the same time, they don&rsquo;t realize it.&nbsp; They realize 
they&rsquo;re improving and becoming more accurate&mdash;but they don&rsquo;t 
know how.&nbsp; They just assume they&rsquo;re getting more familiar with the 
problem.</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Implicit Processes in Conscious Problem-Solving&rdquo;<br>
 by 
Davis Wertheimer</p> 
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p> 
<p><em>This study used variations on the Balls-and-Boxes problem-solving task 
(Kotovsky &amp; Simon, 1990) to investigate unconscious processes in conscious 
thought. When subjects repeatedly solved the original Balls-and-Boxes puzzle, 
their accuracy and speed improved, despite having no awareness of how to solve 
the puzzle. Learning was implicit and unconscious. Multiple proposed strategies 
are available for implicit solution, but previous studies couldn&rsquo;t reveal 
which, if any, were predominant. Hypothesized strategies include deductive, 
metacognitive, memory-based and pattern-based approaches. Ten Balls-and-Boxes 
variations were solved over three trials to determine subjects&rsquo; relative 
proficiency rates in successive tasks. Different strategies were applicable to 
different variations, making them harder or easier to solve given previous 
learning. The strategy effectively in use was determined by measuring relative 
performances in succession. Subjects demonstrated significant improvement 
between trials 1 and 2, unless given a puzzle of different logical operation. 
Such transformations also disrupted otherwise significant correlations among 
individual subjects&rsquo; performances. Subjects consistently demonstrated 
insignificant improvement, even in the absence of any applicable strategy. This 
indicates that subjects relied on implicit deduction performed during trial 1, 
modulated by familiarity in later trials. In a broader context, human 
&ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in problem-solving is deductive, but inhibited or 
augmented by separate explicit learning.</em></p>

<h1>Chappaqua Farmers Market: Maria Reina&rsquo;s creates a cilantro and 
cashew-encrusted fish</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong> The Market runs every Saturday from 9am to 1:30pm at St. 
Mary&rsquo;s, next to Bell.</strong><br>
 January 13, 2012<br>
<em>by Pascale 
LeDraoulec</em></p> 
<p>On an impulse, and because my contractor friend had some free time on his 
hands, I decided to remodel my kitchen during the holidays.</p> 
<p><em>What was I thinking?!?!</em></p> <br>

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds. There&rsquo;s something kind 
of humbling&mdash;and liberating&mdash;about being reduced to sub-flooring and 
pipes during what&rsquo;s supposed to be the busiest time of year in the 
kitchen. The contractor has been kind enough to leave my stove and bare-bones 
sink hooked up during the makeover, even though the rest of my kitchen is now 
in my dining room. (My girls think it&rsquo;s really cool that our fridge is in 
the living room).</p> 
<p>All this to say that these days I&rsquo;m keeping the cooking really 
simple. Never have I been more appreciative of having access to farmers market 
products on a weekly basis&mdash;and in the winter no less! I&rsquo;ve said it 
a million times, I know, but, truly, fresh, local ingredients are so inherently 
flavorful they don&rsquo;t require much fussing in the kitchen.</p> 
<p>A friend who is giving me some advice on layout dropped by this week and 
was surprised to smell a Stone Barns chicken roasting in the oven along with 
some Newgate Farms fingerlings and some cumin-dusted cauliflower. &ldquo;I 
can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re cooking when you&rsquo;re kitchen is 
gutted,&rdquo; she said. I literally put everything in a pan, added salt and 
pepper, olive oil and cumin, and was done in five minutes. But the payoff was 
grand.</p> 
<p>Local personal chef Maria Reina (www.bellacucinamaria.com) is also a big 
advocate of keeping things simple in the kitchen. She will be doing a cooking 
demo at the market this week using fresh fish fillets from Pura Vida, encrusted 
with cilantro and sea-salt onion cashews from Tierra Farms and topped with a 
savory jam from Renee&rsquo;s Jams (also here this week). Stop by her table for 
a taste and a copy of the recipe (reprinted below).&nbsp; Maria can also answer 
any ingredient or cooking questions you may have while shopping.</p> 
<p>For a quick and easy lunch these days, I&rsquo;ve been subsisting on 
sandwiches made with Bread Alone ciabatta or levain bread with cheese from 
Amazing Real Live Food Co. This week they are having a 30-percent-off special 
on their nutty Stella Valis Tomme cheese. Make sure to pick some up!</p> 
<p>Lucky for me, I stocked up on some of Renee&rsquo;s savory jams, like 
pineapple habanero, and some of Bombay Emerald&rsquo;s plum chutney last month. 
Good condiments make such a difference! Just like that, they can turn a 
sandwich into a simple pleasure. Speaking of good condiments, make sure to pick 
up some Guyank Brand mango hot sauce this Saturday.</p> 
<p>Roaming Angus is also back this week. If you&rsquo;re a fan of their 
grass-fed beef, this is your chance to stock up. They won&rsquo;t be back until 
January 28th.</p> 
<p>Also back after a long absence is Little Croc Bakehouse! I hate to even 
mention that many of her baked goods are gluten-free and/or vegan because I 
don&rsquo;t want to turn people off. Trust me, you would never know her 
teacakes and lemon bars are &ldquo;missing&rdquo; anything. They are 
divine&hellip;which is why baker Suzanne Whitney has such a loyal following all 
over Westchester.</p> 
<p>See you at the market&mdash;and come early if you want some of those Stone 
Barns eggs!</p> 
<p>Keep your knives at home - Knife Sharpener is back <em><strong>next 
</strong></em>week (January 21)!</p> 
<h2>Nut Crusted Fish Fillets with a Spicy Sauce</h2> 
<p>Makes about 1 &frac12; cups, enough for 4 fillets</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p> 
<p>1 cup Tierra Farm Organic Dry Roasted Sea Salt &amp; Onion Cashews</p> 
<p>&frac14; cup Toasted Fresh Bread Crumbs</p> 
<p>2 cloves of Garlic, finely minced</p> 
<p>3 tablespoons Cilantro, finely chopped</p> 
<p>3 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil, plus more for the pan</p> 
<p>Zest and juice of 1 Lemon, separated</p> 
<p>Kosher Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper</p> 
<p>4 Fish Fillets of your choice, about 1 pound</p> 
<p>Pineapple Habanero Sauce, recipe follows</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p> 
<p>Pulse the cashews in the bowl of a food processor until finely chopped. 
Take care to not completely puree them to a paste. Mix the nuts, garlic, 
cilantro, zest, olive oil, salt and pepper tossing well to combine.</p> 
<p>Lay the fillets out on a cutting board. Brush with olive oil and season 
with salt and pepper. Divide the nut crust between the 4 filets and pack down 
well. Let the fillets sit for a few minutes to bring the crust together.</p> 
<p>In a non-stick pan heat 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. 
Once the pan is hot carefully lay the fillets, crust side down, in the pan and 
leave for 2-3 minutes. (Resist the urge to move it or poke it with the spatula, 
you want the crust to set up under the fish.) Once the crust gets to be a nice 
golden brown carefully flip the fillets over and add the lemon juice to the 
pan. Saut&eacute; another minute until the fish is cooked through.*</p> 
<p>Top with sauce and serve immediately. </p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Pineapple Habanero Sauce</strong></p> 
<p> Pineapple-Habanero Jam, Renee&rsquo;s Jams and Jellies<br>
 &frac12; -1 
tablespoons of Cilantro, finely chopped</p> 
<p>Place 2 ounces of jam (&frac12; of the jar) in a glass bowl. Add 4 ounces 
of water. Microwave on high for 1 minute.&nbsp; Remove and mix well, allowing 
it to cool slightly. Add cilantro to taste and use over the fish.</p> 
<p>*Cook&rsquo;s Note: if using very thick filets you may need to finish 
cooking them in the oven.</p>

<h1>Greeley Hockey Ends Mixed Week with Overtime Loss to Mt. Pleasant</h1> 
<p><strong>Coming up: Fox Lane Thursday at 7:55 pm, Byram Hills Friday Jan 20
</strong><br>
 Tuesday, January 17, 2012<br>
<em>by Bruce Yablon</em></p> 
<p>Greeley Hockey lost three of five games last week beginning with a hard 
fought battle against Pearl River at Brewster Ice Arena.&nbsp; After Greeley 
gave up the first goal of the game Nick Girardi and Sam Mishkind found the back 
of the net a few minutes apart and Greeley led 2-1 going into the third period.
</p> <br>

<p>A scramble in front of goaltender Neil Hershman led to a Pearl River goal 
half way through the period and with less than two minutes to go Pearl River 
scored again for a 3-2 victory over Greeley.&nbsp; This was Greeley&rsquo;s 
third loss of the year, each by one goal.</p> 
<p>Next up was undefeated Rye, the fifth ranked team in NY State Division 2 
schools.&nbsp; Rye quickly outskated Greeley to start the game but the Quakers 
battled and a goal by Sam Spar put Greeley up 1-0 after the first period.&nbsp; 
Greeley knew Rye would come out flying in the second period and they did, 
scoring two quick goals and finishing with three more in the period on way to a 
7-1 victory over Greeley.&nbsp; Greeley hockey has improved greatly this year 
but the depth and talent of the Rye team was simply too much.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Greeley followed the Rye loss with an easy 4-3 victory over Newburgh Free 
Academy, controlling the play of the game throughout.</p> 
<p>In a game that the Quakers expected to win, the busy week ended with 
Greeley losing with 10 seconds to go in overtime to Mt Pleasant 3-2.&nbsp; 
Despite pressure on the Mt Pleasant goaltender, only Blake Davis and Owen Gatto 
were able to score in another disappointing one goal loss.</p> 
<p><strong>This week Greeley skates at Brewster against Fox Lane on Thursday 
at 7:55 pm and on Friday Jan 20 vs. Byram Hills.</strong></p> <br>

<p><strong>Background</strong>&nbsp; <br>
</p> 
<p>The Saw Mill River Coalition and the New York State Department of 
Transportation, in conjunction with the Westchester County Department of Parks, 
Recreation and Conservation support the Free-A-Tree project, which supports 
volunteers in their efforts to remove the invasive vines that are strangling 
trees and shrubbery along the Saw Mill River.</p> 
<p>Fast-growing, tenacious vines are among the worst of the foreign plants 
that threaten to overwhelm local habitats. Oriental bittersweet and 
porcelainberry, the two most common invaders, crowd out native plants and 
slowly strangle trees in their upward spiral, eventually shrouding tree 
canopies from the sun and creating a blanket over under-story plants and 
shrubs. This significantly diminishes the value of wildlife habitat, in terms 
of food sources and nesting areas, and has a negative impact upon the number of 
species that use the river corridor. The Saw Mill River Coalition and the DOT 
instituted this vine removal pilot project in November 2005 to rescue native 
vegetation, restore the stream buffer, and preserve the area&rsquo;s 
biodiversity.</p>

<h1>Help Prevent Child Abuse: Become a Parent Aide</h1> 
<p><strong>The Child Abuse Prevention Center of NY Announces Fall Volunteer 
Training Dates; Learn Important Social Skills While Helping and Empowering 
Parents at Risk</strong><br>
 January 13, 2012</p> 
<p>The Child Abuse Prevention Center of New York, located in White Plains, is 
calling for Parent Aide Volunteers to assist parents &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for 
abusing their children. No prior experience is necessary and volunteers are 
welcome from throughout Westchester and surrounding Counties.<em>UPDATE Tues. 
Jan. 17: If you schedule an orientation before January 21, you&rsquo;ll be in 
time to attend two Saturday training sessions on January 21 and 28.</em></p> 
<br> 
<p>Parent Aide Volunteers will spend approximately one hour each week 
supporting an assigned parent, but must first complete a 12-hour training 
course that provides them with the knowledge they need to become 
&ldquo;nurturing, supportive role models to parents who need help dealing with 
their parenting concerns,&rdquo; says Laura Schwartz, Executive Director, Child 
Abuse Prevention Center.</p> 
<p>She continued, &ldquo;Our Parent Aide Volunteers are an essential and 
integral part of the Center &ndash; they usually provide a critical 50% of the 
support to families.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>According to Linda Paver, Assistant Executive Director, Child Abuse 
Prevention Center, the majority of the people who go through the training 
program at the Child Abuse Prevention Center find it rewarding and useful in 
their own lives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Parent Aide Volunteers have all said that the 
information they picked up at our training sessions actually helped them in 
situations encountered in day-to-day living.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s truly a wonderful 
and rewarding experience for all.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Anyone interested in volunteering should call the Child Abuse Prevention 
Center to schedule an orientation date anytime that&rsquo;s convenient for 
them. This orientation will be followed by a choice of two six-hour training 
date sessions, next offered on Saturday, January 21 and Saturday, January 28,

<h1>Sports Buzz: Greeley Fall Sports Post-Season Honors</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>All-League Fall 2011 Awards&mdash;Tennis</em><br>
 Monday, January 
9, 2012<br>
<em>by Jim Nottingham</em></p> 
<p><strong>Fall Sports Athletes Inducted; Greeley Sports Boosters Honor Board
</strong></p> <br>

<p>There was an elite gathering of Greeley athletes at the Horace Greeley 
Gymnasium on Saturday morning at 9:30 a.m.&nbsp; The athletes, representing 
every fall season sport, were present to receive their post-season All-League, 
All-County and/or All-Section honors.&nbsp; This season had a record number of 
Greeley athletes receiving awards &ndash; 46 in all.&nbsp; The Greeley Sports 
Booster Honor Board houses a plaque for each athlete on the gymnasium wall.</p> 
<p>The ceremony was conducted by Horace Greeley Athletic Director Steve Young 
who asked each of the teams to stand and then spoke about the teams&rsquo; 
seasons to the assembly of parents sitting in the bleachers.&nbsp; Young then 
announced the name of each athlete from the team standing and cited her or his 
accomplishments and awards.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The athletes stood proudly, but were endearingly humbled by the recognition 
in front of their peers and parents present.&nbsp; The complete list of the 
honorees is at the end of this column, but you should take some time to visit 
the gym and view the Honor Board&hellip;..it is impressive!</p> 
<p>Congratulations to all athletes.&nbsp; Your achievements on behalf of 
Greeley Athletics not only deserve recognition, but also a thank you from the 
community for your athleticism, sportsmanship and dedication and for 
representing the best of Horace Greeley High School as scholar-athletes.</p> 
<p>Special recognition was given to two coaches - Suzanne Guziec, Head Coach 
of the Girls&rsquo; Swimming and Diving Team, was selected by<em>The Journal 
News</em> as the Section One Swim Coach of the Year and Erin Tracy, Head Coach 
of the Girls&rsquo; Soccer Team was named the League&rsquo;s Coach of the 
Year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Booster Honor Board Induction Ceremony is open to all. The next 
ceremony will be held in the early spring for the winter season sports after 
the honors are voted on by the coaches. The spring season honor ceremony is 
held during June.</p>

<h1>Second half of school taxes due January 31; ten percent penalty starts 
Feb. 1</h1> 
<p><strong>Town Hall will be open from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.; pay online till 
11:59 p.m.</strong><br>
 January 30, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>Bright green postcards went out two weeks ago to the 2200 residents who had 
not yet paid the second half of their school taxes, which must be postmarked or 
received by the tax office by close-of-business on Tuesday, January 31.&nbsp; A 
10% penalty applies beginning February 1.</p> <br>

<p>This is the third year that the town has sent out one mailing only&mdash;on 
August 30&mdash;containing the two halves of the 2011-12 school tax bill.&nbsp; 
According to Town Clerk and Receiver of Taxes Jill Simon Shapiro, the 10% 
penalty that attaches on February 1 to any late payment has been arrived at 
gradually.&nbsp; The first half of the current school tax was due by September 
30 and on October 1 the penalty on unpaid bills would have been 2%.&nbsp; On 
November 1 it climbed to 5%, then to 7% on December 1 and now, to 10% on 
February 1.&nbsp; In April the fee goes to 12%, then another 1% penalty is 
added for each additional month.</p> 
<p>Technically, said Shapiro, the entire school tax bill was due on September 
30, but a four-month grace period is allowed in which to pay the second half. 
She advises paying the bill&mdash;even if by credit card&mdash;by the September 
30 due date, since the credit card fee is far less than the 10% late fee the 
town is obliged to charge.&nbsp; You can pay online until 11:59 p.m. 
Tuesday&mdash;but don&rsquo;t wait that long.</p> 
<p>About 4,000 school tax bills go out to residents in August.&nbsp; Since 
many people wait until the end of December to pay the second half, Shapiro 
said, she waits until January to send out the reminder post cards only to the 
2200 who have not yet paid the second-half bill. The 29-cent reminder postcard 
is still far less expensive than sending out 4000 tax bills a second time.</p> 
<p>As of two week ago, about 90 residents had not yet paid the first half of 
their school taxes.</p> <br>

<h1>In the garden with Shobha Vanchiswar</h1> 
<p><br>
 January 20, 2012</p> 
<p>Just to remind you what it was like this this time last year, I&rsquo;m 
going to share a poem I wrote almost to the date last January.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp; Compare And Contrast</p> 
<p><br>
 I&rsquo;m beginning to get a tad anxious about this winter. Where is 
it? Thus far its been mostly like a very cold spring. Judging from the 
appearance of some snow drops and forsythia currently in bloom even the garden 
seems to concur.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; So different from last winter which had gone to the opposite 
extreme. Unsettling it might be but it also has me curious to see what will be 
the outcome of this unusual weather. There are lessons to be learned ...</p> 
<p>&nbsp; <br>
<strong>Blizzard Magic</strong></p> 
<p>Snow carpeted roof tops edged<br>
 in icicle fringe<br>
 Lilacs costumed as 
pussy-willows<br>
 Hellebore hills, lacy chain-links<br>
 Stepping stones 
become pillows.</p> 
<p>Low is now high and high<br>
 is higher<br>
 Black limbs turned to white<br>
 Crystal berries, snow-cone urns<br>
 Darkness becomes light.</p> 
<p><br>
 Brings back memories right?</p>

<em>Confused Snowdrops</em></p> 
<p><strong>What To Do This Month</strong></p> 
<p>1. Start praying for snow. A nice blanket of it is very much needed for the 
spring bulbs and perennials that require a proper state of dormancy in the cold.
</p> <br>

<p>Humans are not the only ones getting confused by this thus far mostly mild 
winter. I&rsquo;ve already seen forsythia in bloom, daffodils and snowdrops 
happily piercing through the soil and pansies displaying their smiling faces to 
anybody who cares to look.</p> 
<p>2. Once prayers have been answered, make sure all walkways, steps and paths 
are kept clear of ice and snow. Use something mild like sand to give traction.
</p> 
<p>3. Take a turn around the property and ensure that everything that needs 
securing (rose limbs and other climbers, gates) or protecting (evergreens like 
boxwood) are addressed accordingly.</p> 
<p>4. Check on plants being overwintered indoors. Provide adequate water, 
light, warmth and humidity. Inspect for pests or disease. Act right away if 
treatment is required. Organic products please!</p> 
<p>5. Gather up the seed and plant catalogs. Take some real time to plan for 
the seasons ahead. Design new beds, determine which plants are needed and make 
a list of all the requirements to get things ready as soon as the ground thaws 
in spring.</p> 
<p>6. Order plants and seeds. The plants will arrive closer to planting time. 
But prepare to start seeds indoors as appropriate. Purchase whatever is needed 
such as seed trays, soil etc.</p> 
<p>7. Keep yourself inspired by visiting the conservatory at the New York 
Botanical Gardens.</p> 
<p>8. Pamper yourself by putting feet up for hours at length. Spring will be 
here all too soon and you want to be ready and willing.</p> 
<p>9. In that same vein, do plenty of reading in winter as time to read is 
always short when garden chores seem endless.</p> <br>

<p><strong>Sculpture in the garden</strong></p> <br>

<p>In the quiet months of winter one can actually scrutinize the garden. Where 
there is in other months so much busy-ness with leaves, limbs, flowers and 
such, it is now possible to observe the true lay-of-the-land.&nbsp; Do you see 
the clearly empty spaces and wonder what can be done about them? Winter gardens 
needn&rsquo;t look sorry and lonesome. The starkness of certain spots are 
simply in obvious need of something to beguile the winter weary heart . Enter 
sculpture!</p> 
<p> Does that word evoke images of marble statuary so typical of old, majestic 
Italianate gardens or of the gnomes and jockey class of kitsch? Unless any of 
those are exactly what you favor, I&rsquo;m not talking about them at all. The 
bleakness of a garden in winter begs for the addition of interesting structure, 
something to break up the visual blandness.</p> 
<p> Sculptures bring shape and texture to a garden. They can be 
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; works of art made of wood, metal or stone or 
&ldquo;soft,&rdquo; when plants are shaped into topiaries. Standing alone in a 
well marked spot, sculptures can make bold statements. Or, they can be 
positioned amidst plants in beds and borders where everything works together to 
tell a gentle story. Or, imagine coming upon a lovely work of art in the middle 
of a quiet woodland. Whatever it might be, sculpture should be sized right. 
Nothing too large to dominate the entire garden not too small that it&rsquo;ll 
be easily overlooked. Let it give the landscape some<em>oomph</em>, some <em>
panache</em>.</p> 
<p> Topiary, the deliberate shaping of plants is an age old tradition but can 
be used today in more modern ways. Crisp geometric structures of boxwood in 
spheres, cones or cubes can appear very au courant in the right context. The 
type of garden dictates the style. Even a hedge trimmed to sharp edges and 
right angles can lend a contemporary air.&nbsp; The gentle undulations of a 
well clipped fence of yew while demarcating the external boundary of the 
garden, also introduces a certain lyrical charm that is striking in all 
seasons. The high living fences bordering Piet Oudolph&rsquo;s garden in 
Hummelo come to mind.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Trees and shrubs are naturally sculptural. Think how interesting are 
the barks of birch, acer, plane or shag. Or the the colored dogwoods and 
willow. The seedpods left deliberately to dance on the tops of grasses and such 
make for ethereal sculptures. Nature herself provides endless choices: the 
gardener simply has to plant well.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Sculptures can suit diverse tastes, budgets and every garden can 
benefit from having one or two of them. Works of nature such as large rocks or 
abstract forms of driftwood can be all that are needed. One can choose 
traditional or modern works but just be sure they look right in the garden. One 
needs to notice the sculpture but it should not detract from it&rsquo;s 
surroundings.&nbsp; Select something whimsical like a wind mobile to introduce 
movement. Interesting fountains, sundials and birdbaths do double duty. They 
offer visual stimulation and perform a function.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; A statue can be a surprise element when partially hidden by shrubs 
in the growing season. It becomes something more striking after the leaves have 
fallen and offsets the barrenness of winter. Something placed to highlight the 
quirky shadows cast by the midday sun would be sufficient to capture the 
imagination.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Take a look around what you already own. Think outside the box and 
you just might come up with something unique to display. Or, purchase or 
commission something from an up and coming artist. You can get a one of a kind 
piece of art for a reasonable price and support an aspiring artist at the same 
time. Whatever your choice, &lsquo;soft&rsquo; or &lsquo;hard&rsquo;, be sure 
you know everything about the care of the sculpture and that you can handle 
what is required.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; For inspiration, visit the Pepsi sculpture gardens in Purchase. Or, 
search the Internet to check out the Chihuly and Henry Moore exhibits at the 
New York Botanical Gardens from the recent past.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; Gardens offer a marvelous canvas for artwork and creativity so lets 
take advantage and add something clever to our own stretch of earth.</p>

<h1>Newly-elected representatives and judges take oath of office</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>Waiting to begin; see more photos in &ldquo;Read 
more&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br>
 January 6, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em>
</p> 
<p>A full crowd at town hall chatted and noshed as they waited for U.S. 
Congresswoman Nita Lowey to arrive from Albany to swear in new Town Supervisor 
Susan Carpenter, re-elected Deputy Supervisor Elise Mottel, town councilman 
Jason Chapin, re-elected town justices Douglas Kraus and David Zuckerman and 
County Legislator Mike Kaplowitz.&nbsp; Lowey as emcee was worth the 
wait&mdash;still beaming after a day that had begun with her attendance at 
Governor Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the State&rdquo; address at 1:30 
that afternoon in Albany and eager to usher into office New Castle&rsquo;s town 
board members and justices.</p> <br>

<p>Lowey began by recommending that the audience listen to the 
governor&rsquo;s speech on New York&rsquo;s economy, jobs and future.&nbsp; She 
administered the oath of office first to Mike Kaplowitz, who joked, when she 
praised him, that he felt as though he was at his bar mitzvah.&nbsp; For each 
of the officials, Lowey paused after the &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; and looked 
expectantly, to hint that they should supply their names; and each then did, as 
though surprised by the need.&nbsp; By the time Lowey got to Supervisor Susan 
Carpenter, the last one to take her oath, Carpenter supplied her name promptly, 
without the prompt.</p> 
<p>Republican opponents from November&rsquo;s election&mdash;Bob Kirkwood, 
Rich Diefenbach and Kevin Moore&mdash;and independent Rob Greenstein attended 
the ceremony. School board members Randy Katchis and Karen Visser were also 
present, as were many members of the volunteer boards and advisory committees.
</p> 
<p>Past supervisors Polly Kuhn, Clinton Smith, Jan Wells and Barbara Gerrard 
posed with Susan Carpenter for a supervisors-past-and-present photo.&nbsp; See

<h1>Merchant of the Week: EZ Sports guy Pete Zimmerman</h1> 
<p><br>
<em>More photos in &ldquo;Read more&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br>
 January 
6, 2012<br>
<em>by Rob Greenstein</em></p> 
<p>I paid Pete Zimmerman a visit this week, to ask him about his 50 years in 
New Castle, and his 20 years running EZ Sports.</p> <br>

<p><strong>How long have you and your store been part of our community?
</strong></p> 
<p>This is our store&rsquo;s 20th year.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lived in Chappaqua 
for 50 years.&nbsp; My passion is Greeley sports, especially recreation 
football, grades 4 to 6.&nbsp; I have coached lacrosse and baseball on and off 
for 40 years.&nbsp; Last year, I was assistant coach for 3rd grade Lacrosse 
with Russell Maitland, the Chappaqua Fire Dept Chief, who I coached when he 
played on Greeley JV lacrosse team in the early 80s.&nbsp; The store has given 
me the opportunity to stay involved with Greeley sports.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t 
imagine having a store anywhere else.</p> 
<p><strong>You carry so much Greeley logo merchandise, as well as uniforms and 
equipment for Greeley sports, have you always been focused on Greeley sports?
</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, we are all about Greeley Sports.&nbsp; EZ sports is named after my 
late father Ed Zimmerman, who taught me the love of Sports.&nbsp; Having lived 
in the community for 50 years, I&rsquo;ve always loved Greeley sports.&nbsp; We 
are a one-stop shop for Greeley athletes and fans alike.&nbsp; Maybe now is the 
time to change our name to<em>Greeley</em> EZ Sports.</p> 
<p><strong>Instead of using your window space to highlight your merchandise, 
you have photos of all the Greeley teams, do your customers appreciate that?
</strong></p> 
<p>The pictures of the sports teams is what I&rsquo;m all about, promoting the 
student athletes. My motto is WE SHINE TOGETHER.&nbsp; The pictures are a small 
sampling of what I&rsquo;ve collected over the years.&nbsp; We have pictures of 
Greeley teams going back to the 1930&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Everybody loves looking at 
the pictures in the window.</p> 
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve been involved in Greeley sports probably longer than 
anyone else in town, what changes have you noticed over the years?</strong></p> 
<p>Since the Fall of 1959, when my family moved to Chappaqua, the major change 
in sports in town is multi-season and travel teams.&nbsp; So many sports are no 
longer a one-season commitment, which is good and bad.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s tough 
for kids to play multiple sports.&nbsp; Quite often they need to chose between 
football, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, baseball, hockey and 
basketball.&nbsp; Female participation in organized sports has certainly 
increased over the years, which is great.</p> 
<p><strong>From a merchant point of view, what changes have you noticed over 
the years?</strong></p> 
<p>It seems that all or most of the town merchants were residents of New 
Castle and there was a bond between merchants and their customers.&nbsp; 
Nowadays, there are a lot of absentee landlords.&nbsp; The Town is in a 
difficult situation, because they have very little control over the landlords 
to reshape the retail mix in town.</p> 
<p><strong>I know you&rsquo;ve been active with the Turf Committee, 
how&rsquo;s that going?&nbsp; And how can residents donate?</strong></p> 
<p>The Turf Committee is working hard to bring the turf field, and lights, to 
the community.&nbsp; I think a turf field would be great for Greeley 
sports.&nbsp; The new field will be available on an equal basis for all 
sports.&nbsp; The lights will allow night practice during hot weather 
days.&nbsp; Important games can be played at our home field instead of at a 
rented field in another community.&nbsp; Friday night football games would be 
great for our community.&nbsp; You can donate on &ldquo;The Chappaqua Turf 
Committee&rdquo; web sitehttp://www.chappaquaturf.org.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think the town could do to make conditions better for 
business?</strong></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough question.&nbsp; I have a lot of contact with Greeley 
alumni, maybe they&rsquo;ll have some suggestions.&nbsp; Things definitely need 
to improve.</p> 
<p><strong>Any special discounts for <em>NewCastleNOW</em> readers who mention 
this article?</strong></p> 
<p>Mention <em>NewCastleNOW</em> and receive 20% off all in-store Greeley 
merchandise (no specials orders).</p>

<h1>Greeley wrestlers take the show to Rhode Island</h1> 
<p><br>
<strong>Next home meet: 4:30 p.m. Wednesday against Fox Lane</strong>
<br> <em>More photos in &ldquo;Read more&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br>
 Monday, 
January 9, 2012<br>
<em>by Coach Mike DeBellis</em></p> 
<p>Kirby Atlas, Billy Marino, Matt Mercer, and Scott Wymbs propelled Greeley 
to a 7th place finish at the Chad Antoch Tournament in Westerly, Rhode Island 
on Saturday, January 7th.</p> <br>

<p>Kirby Atlas placed third in his 113-pound weight class.&nbsp; Kirby busted 
his lip in the second match of the day and continued to wrestle strong 
throughout the day despite extreme pain.</p> 
<p><br>
 Jon Russo placed fourth in the 126-pound weight class, the toughest 
weight class in the tournament.</p> 
<p><br>
 Matt Mercer had the best tournament of his career placing third out 
of 16 guys in his 138-pound weight class.</p> 
<p>Billy Marino, 195 pounds, wrestled up a weight class for the team and 
placed third in the 220-pound weight class.&nbsp; I asked Bill if he would bump 
up so the team could score more points and he responded &ldquo;anything for the 
team, Coach&rdquo;.&nbsp; It is so nice to be coaching a team that has this 
attitude.</p> 
<p><br>
 Scott Wymbs stole the show once again beating a Connecticut state 
runner-up in the finals. Scott recorded the fall in 2:35.&nbsp; Scott continues 
to dominate at the 195-pound weight class.&nbsp; Scott is currently 26-0.</p> 
<p><br>
 Other top six place finishers for Greeley were: Mike Orbeta, Mitchell 
Klein, Brock Cvijanovich, Liam Mercer, Kolbe Jendzejec, Grady Jendzejec, Ryan 
Rudinger, Anthony Sasso, Elijah Kim, and Sammy Tugendhaft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
 The entire team wrestled extremely well against some high level 
competition.&nbsp; Going into the tournament, we did not know what to 
expect.&nbsp; I think the Greeley wrestlers stepped up to a big challenge and 
it says a lot about their character.&nbsp; They are getting tougher and tougher 
as the year progresses.</p> 
<p><br>
 Our next home meet is on <strong>Wednesday against Fox Lane</strong>, 
coached by Hall of Fame Coach Joe Amuso, Sr.. We see Amuso&rsquo;s son, Joe Jr. 
at home on<strong>Friday when we host a dual meet against Division 2 powerhouse 
Pawling</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Both matches this week will begin at 4:30 in 
the wrestling gym at Greeley.</strong>&nbsp; It should be a fun and exciting 
week and we hope to see you there.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>A look ahead at Board of Ed issues for the new year</h1> 
<p><strong>The next Board of Ed meeting is &ldquo;Budget Preview&rdquo; on 
Tuesday, January 10, 2012, when the board will discuss &ldquo;How are we 
responding to the BoE fiscal question?&rdquo;</strong><br>
 December 30, 2011
<br> <em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>&bull; The CEFF committee has chosen three action items. What next?</p> 
<p>&bull; How many applicants so far for the two principal positions?</p> 
<p>&bull; Does the $3.1 million rollover budget figure include last 
year&rsquo;s $4+ million of reserves?</p> 
<p>&bull; When will the input from the budget Knowledge Cafe be released?</p> 
<p>&bull; In a Jan. 31 meeting, board members will discuss the book <em>
<strong>Getting to Yes</strong></em>.&nbsp; Good reading for the community?</p> 
<p>&bull; In a Jan. 31 meeting, the board of ed will consider a third 
&ldquo;Strategic Question&rdquo; on student wellness, both physical and 
spiritual</p> <br>

<p>In its December 15 meeting, the Chappaqua Education for the Future 
committee settled on three areas for improvement for the school district.&nbsp; 
According to Superintendent Lyn McKay, they are:</p> 
<p>(1) moving forward 21st century skills in our schools, </p> 
<p>(2) supporting the social and emotional needs of our students, and </p> 
<p>(3) exploring ways to ensure students learn in an environment in which they 
are motivated to take risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Three parents and a teacher are summarizing our work to date,&rdquo; 
wrote McKay in an email, &ldquo;which we will put on the website.&nbsp; We will 
ask for community input.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 This week, the district&rsquo;s 
public information officer, David Hayes, gathered information from several 
administrators in response to a series of questions from NCNOW:</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW:</strong>&nbsp; What will happen next with the CEFF committee 
and its action items?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes: </strong> A small group of four committee members will be 
working with Eric Byrne in January to pull together information from the three 
working groups of the CEFF. The work will be shared in January through the CCSD 
electronic newsletter and will highlight the three areas of focus that we will 
move forward.</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW: </strong>&nbsp; How many applicants for the two principal 
spots have you received so far?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes: </strong> Applications for our principal positions as of 9am 
on Wednesday, December 21st:</p> 
<p>HGHS &ndash; 70</p> 
<p>RBS - 95</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW:</strong>&nbsp; In the board&rsquo;s scheduled January 10 
&ldquo;Budget Preview,&rdquo; its agenda question for that evening is 
&ldquo;How are we responding to BOE fiscal question?&rdquo;&nbsp; Will 
administrators present an ball-park budget or just discuss process? Although it 
looks as though the tax cap allows $1.9 million additional dollars in the 
2012-2013 budget, I&rsquo;m still confused about the $3.1 rollover budget 
figure John supplied to NCNOW, and about how the administration arrived at the 
$1.8 million figure for cuts, since a provisional dollar amount for reserves 
use hasn&rsquo;t yet been supplied.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For example, does the $3.1 million figure for rollover assume/include the 
$4+ million we drew on from reserves last year?&nbsp; If it does not, does that 
mean that the rollover figure is more like $7.1 million?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes:&nbsp; </strong>The January 10 meeting will be to discuss the 
process and to take a look at where things currently stand since there are 
still many &lsquo;unknowns&rsquo; such as Teachers Retirement System (TRS), 
Transportation Costs, Special Education Placements, State Aid, Assessed Tax 
Value, Tax Certiorari Settlements and the Tax Cap Number. The Board meeting on 
February 28th will be the &ldquo;Superintendent&rsquo;s Budget Proposal and 
Budget Discussion (School Programs and Staffing)&rdquo; and at that time we 
should have a better sense as to what the 2012-13 budget will look like.</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW: </strong> At the Knowledge Cafe on budget, participants were 
asked to consider:</p> 
<p>1) What specific cuts they would make to arrive at $1.8 million in cuts, 
</p> 
<p>2) What other sources of revenue could they think of, and</p> 
<p>3) What is a long-term financial issue that the school district must begin 
to address now? And, how?</p> 
<p>When will the information gathered from participants at the Knowledge Cafe 
on budget be released?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes: </strong>The information gathered at the budget process 
Knowledge Caf&eacute; was turned over to the Finance Advisory Committee. They 
are currently in the process of analyzing the information for recurring themes. 
Since there was a large amount of information collected, the committee expects 
to have this process completed sometime in January. Once the process is 
complete, the themes as well as the raw data will be posted on the CCSD web 
site, etc.</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW: </strong> On the board of ed&rsquo;s January 31 meeting 
agenda is an item called &ldquo;Book Study.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book&rsquo;s title 
is<em>Getting to Yes, Negotiating Agreement without Giving In</em> [first 
published in 1981].&nbsp; Is this a book board members will read over the 
holiday and discuss at the January 31 meeting?&nbsp; Do you recommend that 
community members read the book also?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes:&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>Getting to Yes</strong></em> is 
an excellent resource for people in all walks of life to learn how to better 
communicate, collaborate, and negotiate. It is a highly regarded text that our 
administrative team and Board of Education will be reading and discussing in 
January. Any community member who is interested in the fine art of 
communication might find the book to be an interesting read.</p> 
<p><strong>NCNOW: </strong> That same January 31 meeting lists &ldquo;Board 
Discussion: Third Strategic Question.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this third question 
related to (or even the same as) the second CEFF action item, having to do with 
&ldquo;social and emotional health&rdquo; of students? If so, when and how did 
this issue come to the fore of administrators&rsquo; attention?</p> 
<p><strong>Hayes:&nbsp; </strong>This is just an opportunity for the Board to, 
should they even chose to do so, initiate a brief discussion regarding whether 
or not to pursue the possibility of beginning to draft a 3rd strategic 
question.&nbsp; Various groups have suggested over the past years that creating 
a third question might be relevant.&nbsp; A third strategic question would not 
address just social/emotional learning, but the broader realm of wellness and 
ensuring that students strike a healthy balance in their lives and nourish 
their bodies and spirits as well as their minds.</p>

<h1>Greeley Boys Varsity Basketball starts League play with win over Harrison
</h1> 
<p><strong>TONIGHT: Greeley plays Fox Lane on Friday, January 6th, at 6:45 
p.m. at Greeley</strong><br>
 January 6, 2012<br>
<em>by Brian Rosen</em></p> 
<p>The Greeley Boys Varsity basketball team started League play on Wednesday 
with a 54-49 over Harrison.&nbsp; Greeley (4-3 on the season) was led by 
Harrison Brown and Brett Klein, each with 14 points.&nbsp; The game also marked 
the return of Senior Co-Captain Justin Ciero who chipped in with 12 points.</p> 
<br> 
<p>This was the first game for both teams after the school recess and both 
Harrison and Greeley started slowly in the first half, with points coming at a 
premium.&nbsp; Greeley led 11-10 after one period but trailed at the half by 2 
points, 20-18.</p> 
<p>Greeley responded in the third period with aggressive defense, two quick 
reverse layups by Teddy Graves, and a rebound hoop by Brett Klein forcing 
Harrison to call timeout with Greeley storming to a 26-22 lead.&nbsp; After the 
break, the Quakers continued their play, with Graves contributing another 
layup, and Senior Co-Captain Josh Rosen intercepting a Harrison pass and 
assisting to Brett Klein who made the hoop and was fouled on the play.&nbsp; 
Greeley outscored Harrison in the third 17-11 and led 35-31 after the period.
</p> 
<p>The fourth period was a see-saw battle.&nbsp; Harrison attempted to 
accelerate play with a full court press, but the Quakers consistently broke the 
pressure, leading to uncontested layups by Ciero and Brown.&nbsp; Also, Jeremy 
Kesselhaut played swarming defense during the fourth and helped limit 
Harrison&rsquo;s leading scorer, Coby Lefkowitz, to 14 points.</p> 
<p><em>The game was filmed by MSG Varsity and will be shown on Cablevision MSG 
Varsity on Friday, at 7:30 p.m., and repeated several times over the weekend.
</em></p> 
<p>NEXT GAME:&nbsp; Greeley plays Fox Lane on Friday, January 6th, at 6:45 
p.m. at Greeley.&nbsp; Please come out and support the Quakers.</p>

<h1>New Hours for the Recyling Department Begin</h1> 
<p><br>
 Monday, January 2, 2012<br>
<em>by Christine Yeres</em></p> 
<p>The Recycling Center yard itself, for residential recycling, will remain 
open from 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., but starting this week, the Recycling 
Department<strong>office will be closed from 11:15 a.m. &ndash; 12:00 noon on 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday</strong>. Leaf bag and recycling bin purchases, 
mulch delivery orders, and electronics disposal services will not be available 
during this 45-minute time period.&nbsp; Saturdays the office will remain open 
continuously from 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. &ldquo;Because Saturday is by far the 
biggest day for recycle visits,&rdquo; explained Recycling Foreman Bart Carey.
</p> <br>

<p>Although the Recycle Center <em>yard </em>remains accessible to residents 
from 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Monday through Saturday, the office is closed on 
Mondays and Tuesdays so that staff can sort the cardboard, paper and co-mingle 
that arrives on Saturdays.</p> 
<p>The yard waste drop off area, farther north on Hunts Lane, will remain open 
from Monday through Saturday from 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. continuously.</p> 
<p>For more recycling info, visit the Department of Public Works page of the

bins are always there to browse through.</p> <br>

<h1>In the garden with Shobha Vanchiswar</h1> 
<p><br>
 January 6, 2012</p> 
<p><strong> New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions</strong></p> <br>

<p> I&rsquo;m content to know myself well enough that I no longer make 
resolutions at which I&rsquo;m certain to fail. Why set myself up to fail 
right? However, I need challenges to keep going, doing better and making real 
contributions. On the surface, the two words seem to imply the same thing. But 
there&rsquo;s a difference, at least to me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; In making a resolution, I&rsquo;ve been given the ultimate goal and 
not meeting it would mean defeat. However, a challenge clearly calls for me to 
just do my best. My best is not your best and may not reach the final goal but 
there is much satisfaction in knowing I tried my hardest. That&rsquo;s all one 
can ask for. It&rsquo;s all semantics you might say and you might be right; but 
this works for me. I reach higher and harder and that&rsquo;s really what 
matters.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; In that vein of thought, here are my 2012 challenges in the garden:
</p> 
<p>1. To spend a minimum of one half hour each day simply enjoying the garden. 
Observing what is going on and being fully present. This is quite hard for me 
as its really difficult not to notice what needs doing and get impatient to 
take care of the problem.</p> 
<p>2. To stick to my weeding and general maintenance schedule but not get 
crazy when the weather precludes the effort.</p> 
<p>3. To remember that both plants and humans are highly resilient and will 
therefore surmount crises such as storms, pests or hangovers.</p> 
<p>4. To understand more about sustainability and organic practices and 
implement more of the same in the garden. It is so easy to feel one is doing 
enough but that is simply not the case. I can and must do more.</p> 
<p>5. To add at least three new native plants to the garden. By new I mean new 
to my garden. To that end, I&rsquo;m starting right away with an American 
winterberry shrub. For the last few years I&rsquo;ve been mindful about 
introducing natives as replacements or additions. So this challenge is an 
ongoing one but, it never hurts to remind oneself. I&rsquo;m not against all 
non-native plants. If they&rsquo;ve been around long enough and are not 
invasive then they are acceptable. It is crucial however to have far more 
indigenous plants than those that are not.</p> 
<p>6. To propagate more plants. For one thing, it&rsquo;ll be easy on the 
pocketbook and provide well for the garden. The other is that I&rsquo;ll be 
able to share more with friends. Identifying plants given to me by other 
gardeners is rather special so I enjoy paying it forward.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Happy New Year to one and all! May 2012 be the best year yet.

<h1>Christmas 1963</h1> 
<p><br>
 December 23, 2011<br>
<i>by Joseph Enzweiler</i></p> 
<p><em>Because we wanted much that year<br>
 and had little. Because the 
winter phone<br>
 for days stayed silent that would call<br>
 our father back 
to work, and he<br>
 kept silent too with our mother,<br>
 fearfully proud 
before us.</em></p> <em> 
<p>Because I was young that morning<br>
 in gray light untouched on the rug<br>
 and our gifts were so few, propped<br>
 along the furniture, for a second<br>
 
my heart fell, then saw how large<br>
 they made the spaces between them</p> 
<p>to take the place of less. Because <br>
 the curtained sun rose brightly 
<br> on our discarded paper and the things<br>
 themselves, these forty years,
<br> have grown too small to see, the emptiness<br>
 measured out remains the 
gift,</p> 
<p>fills the whole room now, that whole year<br>
 out across the snowy lawn. 
Because<br>
 a drop of shame burned quietly <br>
 in the province of love. 
Because<br>
 we had little that year<br>
 and were given much. </p></em>
