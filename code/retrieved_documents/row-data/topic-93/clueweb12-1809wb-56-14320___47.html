<p></p> Overview
<p> </p>
<p> Water is everywhere. Water is essential for all living organisms. Man can 
survive without food for weeks or even months, but without water perhaps only 
for days. Even the human body consists of three quarters water. 1 The 
significant body parts are composed of water. The brain is composed of 70 
percent water. The lungs are about 90 percent water. 2 There is water in the 
air, water in the ground, and in food and liquids that man consumes. Basically 
water is one of the most important sources of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> All living organisms need water to survive. However, we forget that fresh 
water will eventually be depleted if not conserved. Man is misusing water and 
abusing its sources. The manufacturing companies and industrial plants have 
poisoned the water sources such as the brooks, streams, lakes, seas and oceans. 
In Southeast Asia, unscrupulous fisherman use illegal means to catch fish which 
destroy the schools of fish and the coral reef environments. The waterfronts 
are no longer safe for swimming. People buy water in plastic bottles instead of 
drinking from tap water. The plastic bottles are discarded improperly which 
pollutes both land and water ways. As the human population increases, nations 
will face water shortages. In some communities, the use of water is restricted. 
We need to undo our mistakes and do something to sustain our one and only 
planet, Earth. Green chemistry will teach us how to use our water sources 
wisely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Green Chemistry, also known as Sustainable Chemistry, is the design of 
chemical products and processes that reduce hazardous substances. It applies 
across the life cycle, including the design, manufacture, and use of chemical 
products. The technologies used in green chemistry provide waste reduction, 
safer products, less use of energy and resources, and improve competitiveness 
of chemical manufacturers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When I teach science concepts to my students, I use literature to get my 
students engaged. Science terminologies are abstract to them. Using children's 
literature for each lesson makes the challenging science concepts meaningful. 
For instance, the book &quot;S is for Save the Earth&quot; is relevant to green 
chemistry, one of the letters in the alphabet is the letter O. The book 
describes the letter O in poetry form, &quot;Letter O is for the lovely oceans 
&quot; and states scientific facts on how important the ocean waters are on the 
Earth's surface. 3 It explains how plastic and toxic chemicals contaminate the 
rivers, lakes and oceans. The simple suggestion of bringing a trash bag with 
you the next time you get to the beach is doable for readers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> After reading one of the most interesting children's books, S is for Save 
the Planet: A How to be Green Alphabet written by Brad Herzog, you would 
appreciate the small things that people take for granted. It teaches children 
as well as adults the environmental issues that we encounter and gives simple 
suggestions that anyone can understand. Its goal is to teach the readers how 
they can be a force of nature in protecting the Earth for generations to come.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The curriculum unit is designed for second language learners in the 
fourth/fifth grade level. The learners are about 8-9 years old. The class 
consists of 75 percent Hispanic and 25 percent native speakers of English. The 
unit could also be modified for students in the mainstreamed class. The 
learners will be taught in English in reading, science, math and social 
studies. The unit will take about three to four teaching weeks. Reading will be 
integrated to teach science content. It will also include the four proficiency 
skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Children's literature will 
be used to introduce the science concepts when teaching the unit. It is my hope 
that the curriculum unit will increase social awareness and responsibility of 
my students to be stronger forces of nature that will sustain and protect the 
Earth's resources (specifically water) and the environment. They will do simple 
actions that set examples and understand how to use the principles of green 
chemistry for their own future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The unit will focus on the importance of water. The objective of my unit 
is for the students to understand the value of water in all living organisms 
and how green chemistry keeps our water clean and sustainable. The state 
standard objective is for the students to demonstrate an understanding of life 
science.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Strategies
<p> </p>
<p> Since I am integrating reading and science in my unit, I will choose four 
books to introduce my science concepts namely: The Story of Water on Our Planet 
(history of water), The Lorax (green chemistry), and Song of the Water Boatman 
&amp; Other Pond Poems, (The Drop in my Drink: The Story of Water on Our 
Planet, and S is for Save the Planet: A How to be Green Alphabet (green 
chemistry). To introduce the topic about water, I will use The Drop in my 
Drink: The Story of Water on Our Planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Before, During and After reading strategies will be integrated in the 
science lesson. Prior to reading the books I have chosen for my unit, I will 
set a purpose for reading the story. For example in &quot;The Lorax&quot;, each 
student will take the role of a junior scientist who will investigate why the 
Trufulla Forest disappeared. They will have to find out what happened to all 
the plants and animals before and after the Once-ler arrived in the Trufulla 
forest. The book will be previewed by pointing to the title, pictures and 
captions, headings and bold-faced prints, and other graphics. Then I will 
activate students' background knowledge by asking them to think about what they 
already know and write their ideas on sticky notes provided by the teacher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> This strategy is called the Herringbone strategy. It is used for fiction, 
non-fiction and expository text. I find this strategy applicable for the 
science content of my unit. The Herringbone strategy helps students summarize 
and synthesize what they have learned in the text. Students make decisions for 
selecting the main idea, significant details and its relationship to science. 
Using a K-W-L chart (What I Know, What I Want to Learn and What I Learned From 
the Story), I will post the sticky notes. The first two, K-W- columns will be 
filled out with sticky notes; then after reading the story, students will put 
their replies to lessons learned in the L- column.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> While I am reading aloud, I will check for students' understanding by 
asking Comprehension Purpose Questions (CPQ) that have been prepared in advance 
and written on sticky notes. The Comprehension Purpose Questions are asked from 
concrete to abstract using the Bloom's Taxonomy concept. The CPQ will be posted 
on the board or on the walls for the students to see. When teachers read with a 
question in mind, we help readers cut through the dense text and zero in on 
important information. Remember that we, the teachers have to plan in depth and 
read ahead. CPQ questions help students review content and relate what they 
have learned to what they already know. 4</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When some students do not understand a sentence or a paragraph, rereading 
helps. Whenever there is a vocabulary word that is not understood, I can skip 
it and read to the end of the paragraph and tell the students to think about 
what would make sense. I will use the context clue, go back and tell the 
students to guess what the word is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I will teach the students how to connect background knowledge to the 
information in the text. Since students have brainstormed prior to reading the 
text, I will tell them to think how the information is similar to what they 
already know about the topic, event or person. I will ask the students to find 
the direct information in the text. If I am reading a longer text, I will stop 
and review what has happened in the story or what information has already been 
given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> After reading aloud, I will tell students to work in groups of four. Each 
group will do the Think-Pair-and-Share strategy. The four students in the group 
will pair up, think and discuss the story. As a group, they will share their 
ideas and one student in the group will be chosen to summarize the story 
orally. After doing this activity, each group will come up with a written 
summary. I will give students a Venn diagram handout. The students to use 
graphic organizers like the Venn diagram to visualize their ideas. Finally, I 
will go back to the posted CPQs, tell the students to write their answers to 
the questions and discuss them with the whole class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Each student must have a science/reading journal notebook to write and 
record their reading and science activities. In their journal notebooks, I will 
teach key words using semantic maps. Semantic maps are used to teach vocabulary 
development. Schirmer states that new knowledge is gained from finding new 
relationships in old knowledge and from relating new information to old 
knowledge. That means students use a semantic map as a visual aid to help them 
think of other words related to the new word. I will write one vocabulary word 
or a key concept and ask the students to think of words related to the 
vocabulary word or the key concept. The teacher and the students group the 
words in categories. I will suggest new words and encourage the students to 
find where the words would fit into the semantic map.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Gist strategy will be used to check students' understanding. I will 
use seven prompts before, during and after reading. Before reading, ask the 
students these questions: What do you think this text is all about? What makes 
you think so? The next three prompts will be used during reading are as 
follows: Did you find evidence that supports your prediction? Explain your 
answer. Did you find evidence that does not support your prediction? If yes, 
explain your answer. Do you want to change your prediction at this point? Why 
or why not? The last two prompts to ask students are: Do you want to make 
changes of what it is all about. If yes, why do you want to make these changes? 
Finally, what did you learn that you did not know before reading?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Remember to tell the students to write their responses and reactions to 
what they are reading in their science/reading journal notebook. These are some 
of the strategies that I will use in integrating reading with science content. 
The seven prompts or questions can be displayed on sentence strips around the 
room, or on a transparency, or a smart board or on the chalk/white board or 
copies are provided for each group of students. Thus, students will be able to 
monitor their own comprehension.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Research studies have shown that reading and science education develop 
similar types of skills such as problem solving and sequencing. Armbruster 
explains that, &quot;the study of science helps develop language and reading 
skills and strengthens the logical processes necessary for effective content 
reading&quot;. 5 Student achievement will increase in both areas when 
integrating science and reading. Hands on activities or science experiments 
help students learn better because they are solving problems, engaging in 
direct investigation, interacting, and promoting the use of real language. 
Students create meaning by listening science, talking science, reading science 
and writing science. Therefore, using these strategies in my unit will entice 
my students to learn meaningfully and effectively.</p>

Unit Background
<p> </p>
<p> Why is water important?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When you see Earth's image from an astronaut's window overlooking space, 
Earth is covered mostly with water. It is the only planet that has liquid water 
on it. History tells us that even the early man learned the he could not live 
without water. Man's thirst led him to live close to water. Water was also his 
source of food. He knew that water was important to every living organism. Man, 
plants and animals needed water for food. Where there is water, life exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Man knows that water is needed for life. Every living organism contains 
water. The human body is composed of 75 percent water, which is also true for 
animals and trees. 6 The main part of the blood is mostly water. The brain, 
muscles, skin and all body tissues contain water. As the saying goes, man can 
live without food for many weeks, but he can live only for a few days without 
water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> What is water?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In chemistry, water is made up of two invisible gases, hydrogen and 
oxygen. There are two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. Hydrogen is the 
simplest and lightest of all elements. It is a nonmetallic element. Hydrogen is 
the most abundant element in the world. Hopefully it will become important in 
the study of fuel cells to generate electricity because it is a clean and 
efficient element. Oxygen, on the other hand, is also a non-metallic element. 
It is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It is one of the most significant 
elements behind most chemical reactions because it is important to life 
processes. When we inhale, oxygen gets into our bloodstream and our blood cells 
carry oxygen to sustain chemical reactions in our body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> There are three states of matter namely solid, liquid and gas. Water has 
three different forms. When the water is frozen, it is in its solid state. The 
freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 0 degrees Celsius. When 
you put water in the freezer, ice forms. Ice also forms during cold winter time 
on ponds, rivers and lakes. When water freezes it expands. A cubic foot of 
water makes more that a cubic foot of ice. That makes ice lighter than the same 
amount of water. In winter, ponds are only frozen on the top. Fish and other 
living organisms swim and feed in the water below. If ice were heavier than 
water, then ponds would freeze from the bottom to the top. All living creatures 
would also freeze. The fish would all die.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When ice melts, water turns to its liquid state. Water boils at 212 
degrees Fahrenheit and 100 degrees Celsius. When water boils it turns into a 
gas called steam. The steam is invisible and, as it cools down, tiny drops of 
water formed. We would see tiny clouds. Clouds are water vapors. They are 
formed when warm, moist air rises and is cooled. There are billions and 
billions of droplets of water which create moisture. Air is never entirely dry 
because of the moisture that surrounds the Earth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Water has three classes of characteristics namely physical, biological and 
chemical. The physical characteristics of water are temperature, taste, odor, 
and turbidity. Water is a colorless substance. The sea waters look blue because 
of the sun's light. The colored light rays are reflected by water molecules. 
This is also true for the ocean waters that look green.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The biological characteristics of water refer to different organisms found 
in it. These organisms are microscopic viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and 
phytoplankton, zooplankton which are the tiny water animals, insects, worms, 
large plants and fish. Humans are affected by the disease causing bacteria and 
viruses which could be present in water. These species that infect humans and 
animals are called pathogens. Pathogens can enter the water system through the 
sewage. Scientists conduct tests to determine contaminated water. They measure 
a certain bacteria called fecal coliforms. Coliforms are found in the 
intestines of mammals. The presence of coliforms in water indicates that sewage 
is present and there may be other disease causing organisms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Alberta Environment research states that water has many chemical 
characteristics. 7 Substances that dissolve in water also contribute to 
chemical water characteristics. The chemicals found in water include the gases 
oxygen and carbon dioxide, salts, substances that stimulate plant growth 
(nitrates and phosphorus) and other man-made substances. Due to the plumbing 
fixtures, iron and manganese are found in ground water. Dioxins and furans are 
only tested after an investigation has been made from the source of these 
chemicals. Water testing for these two chemicals is costly. Dissolved Oxygen is 
an important factor that determines the types of organisms that can survive. 
Trout will survive in the right amount of dissolve oxygen found in clean water, 
that is without the presence of toxic chemicals. Chemical testing is routinely 
done for dissolved oxygen, pH and phosphorous values.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The quality of water changes depending on the nature or human activities. 
On average, each person uses about 80-100 gallons per day in the United States. 
8 Water consumption is high when we use it for flushing the toilets, washing 
and bathing ourselves, our clothes, dishes, cars, and our homes. It takes 4-6 
gallons to flush the toilet, 6-12 gallons to wash dishes, 25-30 gallons to take 
a shower, 30-40 gallons to take a bath, 30-50 gallons per load to wash clothes, 
60 gallons to wash the car, 150 gallons to produce one Sunday newspaper, and 
100-200 gallons to water the lawn. 9 Two gallons per person per day are used 
for drinking and cooking. If we multiply the amount of water for the whole 
population, we will come up with billions of gallons water used daily. That 
figure does not even include the water usage in farm irrigation, and operation 
of factories. For instance, according to research, it takes 63 gallons of water 
to produce one egg. 1 0 Count the amount needed to grow food for the hen, and 
the water that the hen drinks. To produce one-quarter pound of hamburger, it 
would take 625 gallons of water. 1 1 A pound of beefsteak would take 1200 
gallons of water. 1 2 It takes a gallon of water to equal a gallon of gasoline 
by volume. 1 3 To manufacture a ton of steel, it would take almost 62,600 
gallons. 1 4 Put all these figures together and that would approximately give a 
total of almost 500 billion gallons every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> We are so fortunate that in our country, water supply is abundant. There 
is so much water that flows out of the faucet and it seems like our water will 
never run out. Canada and Europe also have abundant water supplies. However, in 
other parts of the world, the people are experiencing water shortages, drought, 
and people have to walk hours to get drinking water from wells which are 
contaminated with pathogens. In some places, bacteria and coliforms are 
present. Their water supply causes illnesses and diseases for humans and 
animals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Water supply for our daily needs comes from rivers, lakes and reservoirs. 
Reservoirs are man-made lakes. Water is also found under the ground. Ground 
water is stored in layers of rocks, sand and soil. Humans and animals need 
fresh water which is free of salt, chemicals and pathogens. Water can only be 
purified and renewed through the water cycle. The water cycle goes from 
precipitation, evaporation, condensation and the cycle goes on and on. 
Precipitation is when rain falls into lakes and stream. Used water goes 
underground or into a sewage system. Then the water flows back to the lakes, 
streams and rivers and some of it evaporates into the air. Water evaporates 
from the oceans, from trees and plants, from animals and humans. This is when 
water becomes water vapor which is a gas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> During condensation the water vapor cools. One drop of water contains 
about 100,000 water droplets. Clouds are made up of water droplets. The wind 
blows the clouds to different places. When the water droplets become heavy, 
they fall as rain or snow. Although some water impurities are picked up during 
evaporation, water remains clean. Water is useful again for our homes, farms 
and industries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Drinking water today is the same water that was here when the dinosaurs 
roamed the Earth. Water is still made of the same molecules. Water evaporates, 
condenses and precipitates in the form of rain or snow. That is the same water 
that was present millions of years ago. We depend on the water cycle because it 
renews and purifies our water supply. There are times when there is no rain, 
which decreases the water level in our rivers and lakes. When drought happens, 
people are asked to conserve water or take the risk of running out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I have mentioned earlier that humans, plants and animals need water. 
However, there are other organisms that need water too. The way we live affects 
the quality of water as well as the health of the organisms. For example, toxic 
chemicals that are not Earth friendly reduce the amount of oxygen available for 
the organisms. Bacteria consume a lot of oxygen when organic waste is broken 
down. Oxidation occurs when some of the compounds in the waste change 
chemically because oxygen is present in the water. Therefore, the organisms 
that can live in lower quality of water survive and those organisms that cannot 
tolerate the reduced level of oxygen will die or move away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Branley describes one of the issues of water emergencies that occur in 
northern New Jersey. 1 5 There are few lakes and reservoirs in that area. 
During the winter, water in the form of rain and snow is collected in the 
reservoirs. When droughts occur, the water in reservoirs is not enough for its 
people, plants, animals and industry. Water must be taken from other resources. 
In the year 1980 - 1981, there was a drought in New Jersey. Water pipes carried 
water from other lakes in the northern states to New Jersey reservoirs. The 
water was taken from other places where people were living in summer cottages, 
called recreational centers, and residents who needed water for their own use. 
This was not a good solution because water from the lakes was drained. 
Residents in the area did not have enough water for their own use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When a problem like this occurs, the solution is to build more reservoirs 
and to build long pipelines to carry water from faraway lakes. New York City 
has built long pipes to provide water to everyone. In 2006, the city consumed 
about 1.086 billion gallons of water average per day. 1 6 Aqueducts carry the 
water to as far as 100 miles from different lakes and reservoirs in upper New 
York State. This is also true for California. The Colorado River and reservoirs 
located in the mountain east of the state supply California with water. The 
residents of New Jersey, New York City, and California hope for heavy snows in 
the winter. When snow melts the water will fill the reservoir.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> According to statistics, the human population is increasing every year. So 
whenever population increases, the consumption of water also increases. Farmers 
have to grow more crops and use water to irrigate their farms. The acre foot is 
the common measure for large quantities of water and is approximately 325,851 
gallons. 1 7 So a 60 acre farm requires thousands of gallons of water each 
planting season. 1 8 The demand of water has increased remarkably. People use 
water at a very high level. There are about two million dams built to store 
water. Millions and millions of well have been dug to bring ground water to the 
surface. 1 9 For instance in Houston, Texas, there is a place where the ground 
has sunk because the pumping of so much water affected the land. As a result, 
many houses sank in sink holes and the residents had to find new homes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Water is very important to us and it should not be taken for granted. When 
water becomes scarce we realize that life cannot go on. Humans, plants and 
animals need good water. The effect of not having enough water will be 
disastrous. The entire place will just be a wasteland. I could not imagine what 
life will be like when I turn on my faucet and not a drop of water comes out. 
There is one place in the world where the cleanest water is found. Russia has 
many lakes. One of the famous lakes is Lake Baikal. It is the deepest lake 
found in the world and also known as the largest fresh water lake. It has the 
purest water and that is why one will find 1700 species of plants and animals. 2
 0 Two thirds of these flora and fauna are not found anywhere else. Baikal is 
considered as the oldest lake in the world. The lake is isolated and surrounded 
with mountains. The water in the lake is well-mixed and well oxygenated. The 
lake supplies water to the local population.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
The Principles of Green Chemistry
<p> </p>
<p> In my unit, students will learn the 12 principles of Green Chemistry. 2 1 
Since I am teaching reading and science to my second language learners, I will 
only focus on Principles One, Two, Three, Four, and Six. These principles will 
help them understand the importance of water to all living organisms and how to 
keep drinking water clean and safe. Most of my students live in apartment 
dwellings. The cost of water bottles in plastic containers is too expensive for 
them. Using tap water will lessen the cost of buying drinking water and will 
minimize the use of plastic bottles which contains chemicals that are hazardous 
to their health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> First Principle</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Green chemistry's first principle states that it is better to prevent 
waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed. To integrate reading 
with science content, the students will read &quot;The Lorax&quot; written by 
Dr. Seuss. The Lorax warned the Once-ler to stop cutting down the truffula 
trees but the Once-ler refused to listen. As a result of his greed, the 
beautiful place where the trufulla trees grew, where the swomee-swans lived, 
where the barbaloots played and ate trufulla seeds, and where the humming fish 
swam became so polluted that everyone left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Water pollution is caused when humans add chemicals into water that cannot 
be filtered out. There are many chemicals on the market and the government has 
identified the toxic chemicals. They are harmful to humans, plants and animals. 
There are two popular manmade products, namely the detergent and softener, 
which many people use to keep their clothes clean. These products contain 
phosphates, neurotoxins and carcinogens that contribute to groundwater 
pollution. Detergents contain phosphates. Phosphates cause the water foaming 
action every time we do our laundry. Washing and rinsing clothes using 
detergents allow chemicals to go into the water supply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Even the fabric softener that makes our clothes smell like pine, jasmine, 
and lavender contains chemicals that have high toxicity. Every time we rinse 
our clothes, water goes through the pipes and the sewage. Fabric softeners 
change the detergent's negative electrical charge back into a positive charge 
thereby reducing static. The film coats, fluffs and scents the fiber. Liquid 
softener contains neurotoxins and carcinogens. These toxic chemicals are 
dangerous to human health because they affect our nervous systems. Neurotoxins 
and carcinogens are slowly released when we wear our clothes and use our towels 
and our sheets. Every time we tumble dry our laundry, we release the toxins 
into our environment through the dryer vents. When we use fabric softeners, the 
clothes increase their flammability because the materials become thinner. The 
softener slowly takes away the fabrics' layers. The unit will teach the 
students that although some chemicals smell good, they are hazardous to human 
health and to our water. Our clothes will still smell clean if we use an 
alternative to fabric softener, such as dryer balls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The use of chemicals in the industry is high. The American Chemistry 
Council tabulates yearly the United States top 100 basic chemicals. In 2000, 
the amount of the top 100 chemicals produced was a total of 502 million tons as 
compared to the 1990 figure of 397 million tons. 2 2 These chemicals are 
necessary to make all kinds of medicines, plastics for making good 
soap/detergent, clothing, and other consumer products that will improve the 
quality of life. However, there is no place to dispose of waste products. For 
many years, people have been disposing waste products away into rivers and 
lakes. As a result, many water sources have become polluted. There are 
thousands of man-made lagoons where waste is disposed of. During the water 
cycle, the water evaporates from these lagoons, and the chemicals become more 
and more concentrated. Since the bottoms of the lagoons are sand and dirt, 
these chemicals are absorbed slowly into the ground water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The EPA informs us of drinking water contaminants. 2 3 Cryptosporidium 
comes from human and animal fecal waste. When a person ingests water that 
contains this contaminant, he/she gets gastrointestinal diseases. Coliforms are 
naturally present in the environment as well as in feces. Viruses are found in 
human and animal fecal waste. One can get gastrointestinal diseases from them. 
When the water gets cloudy, turbidity is tested. It indicates water filtration 
effectiveness. Parasites, bacteria and some microorganisms cause nausea, cramps 
and headaches. There are other contaminants such as disinfectants, inorganic 
chemicals, organic chemicals and radionuclides. All of these contaminants 
affect the health of humans who ingest water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Chemicals that get into the ground water cannot be removed easily. If 
groundwater moves, the water is purified naturally by the soil; if it does not, 
the toxic chemicals stay. The impurities remain underground. Sometimes impure 
water can be purified by pumping it to the surface, treating it and putting the 
water back in the ground. This water purification process is very expensive. 
The best thing to do is not to pollute groundwater.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> What are the different sources of water?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The source of water is not known to everyone. Water that flows from the 
faucet, have two sources. Surface water comes from the water in rivers and 
lakes. Groundwater comes from wells. Most water in the United States comes from 
ground water. The agency that provides us information online is the 
Environmental Protection Agency. A large percentage of the US population get 
their water from the groundwater community supply and the rest of the 
population gets water from private wells, camp grounds and resorts. s. About a 
large number or percentage of the water sources come from the surface and the 
other percentage is from wells. The taste of ground water is different from 
surface water. There is a taste of metal in ground water and it contains 
minerals. In some places, the surface water has a musty taste and looks cloudy. 
The look and taste of water depends on where it is coming from.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The next green chemistry principle will be a combination of principles two 
and three: synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation 
of all materials used in the process into the final product; and wherever 
practicable, synthetic methodologies should be designed to use and generate 
substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the 
environment. The children's literature applicable to this science</p>
<p> content lesson is S is for Save the Planet. The book contains 26 poems and 
practical ways to keep the Earth green. The solution given for the 
environmental issues is suitable for children of all ages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I can incorporate in this lesson the different ways of purifying drinking 
water from the tap. One way of doing it is by simply boiling it. Drinking water 
in the US is the safest water supply in the world. Water is frequently tested 
for human consumption. In most places tap water is safe to drink. The water 
source is well tested. The public is informed of their water supply and when 
there are contaminants in the water suggestions are given on how to purify it 
or not to drink the water at all. When water flows through the rivers and gets 
collected in aquifers, the contaminants are low and not hazardous to human 
health. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains that the public 
water suppliers and well owners must monitor their water supply. There are 
standards for keeping the water supply safe. EPA has named 90 contaminants to 
set their standards and these contaminants are monitored in drinking water. 
Therefore, drinking tap water is safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> There are only a few instances when water is unsafe. This happens when 
there are treatment problems or weather conditions are bad. For example, during 
a hurricane the flood water is most likely to contaminated water that flows to 
the rivers and the wells. The contaminants are not a threat to the public 
health. Water will be treated to remove those contaminants. Bacteria and 
viruses may also contaminate the water. It might cause the following illness: 
vomiting and diarrhea for some people. If the water treatment does not meet 
standards, the water supplier must inform the public. The water suppliers are 
required by the law to notify the consumers. EPA water standards protect 
children and adults from drinking or using unsafe water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The fourth principle of green chemistry is all about designing chemical 
products to preserve efficacy of function while reducing toxicity. The book 
that I will use to integrate reading and science is Song of the Water Boatman 
&amp; Other Pond Poems. The students will read this book to find out what would 
happen to a drying pond and its inhabitants. To sustain Earth's water, we must 
avoid chemicals that affect humans, plants and animals. In this story, when the 
pond dries out the living organisms will perish or disappear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Arsenic, fluoride, and water are toxic to human health. When we drink 
water with these contaminants we are taking water into our system with 
poisonous chemicals that will affect some parts of our body like the colon. 
Arsenic is a heavy metal. It is gray or yellowish. Arsenic is a deadly and 
poisonous element. When it enters our blood stream arsenic is difficult to 
detect. Arsenic is considered as a metal and a non-metal. When industrial 
sections dispose of arsenic improperly it goes into the water-ways. Arsenic is 
so toxic that it causes cancer. Poisoning takes place in the body and results 
in death. Multiple organs in the body fail. The affects are lethal. A large 
amount of arsenic is dangerous for humans as well as animals. The human body 
can ingest a small amount of arsenic because it is essential. Seafood such as 
shrimps and crabs are sources of arsenic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fluoride is classified as a non-metallic element. Its color is pale yellow 
or green. Fluoride is added to water for teeth protection. Some think that it 
prevents tooth decay. That's why fluoride is commercially found in baby 
formula, bottled water, tooth paste, aluminum foil and many more. Another form 
of fluoride is Teflon. Teflon is known for its non-stick coating to pots and 
pans. Fluoride is an element that could take an electron from almost any atom 
and form other compounds. However, a pollutant is created when fluoride is in 
CFC (chlorofluorocarbons). CFCs are used in sprays which have done so much 
damage to the ozone layer. This chemical could be toxic to human, plants and 
animals health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Chlorine is a green and nonmetallic element. It is a toxic gas. According 
to history, chlorine was used as a weapon in World War I. People that inhaled 
this toxic chemical died. These days, chlorine is often used in household 
cleaners. It is a popular chemical because it kills bacteria, especially those 
found in toilet bowls. It could also be used to fight cholera and typhoid fever 
when added to purify drinking water. Chlorine is used to treat our drinking 
water supply. In doing so, our water supple becomes potable and safe. Swimming 
pools use chlorine to keep their water bacteria free. However, it becomes toxic 
to humans, plants and animals when the element is added to the pesticide DDT 
and also when used in CFC products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Water Purification
<p> </p>
<p> How is water purified?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Water purification is the process of removing chemicals or water 
contaminants. It is necessary to purify water because humans need to drink and 
use it. Pharmacology, chemicals and industry need purified water too. There are 
three ways of purifying water namely: physical, biological and chemical 
process. Filtration and sedimentation methods are used for the physical 
purification of water. During filtration, the solids are separated from the 
liquid by using a medium that can let the fluid through; however, the solids 
are retained. The separation depends on the pore size of the medium as well as 
the mechanisms that occur during filtration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sedimentation is another way to purify water. It is used in a waste-water 
treatment plant. Sedimentation reduces the content of suspended solids and the 
contaminants in the water. During the biological process, water is filtered 
through slow sand filters or active sludge. In the chemical process, the 
purification occurs by flocculation, chlorination and by the use of 
electromagnetic radiation. Water purification reduces suspended particles, 
parasites, bacteria, algae, virus and fungi. In this unit, I will briefly 
discuss the simple ways of water purification that are boiling water and using 
activated carbon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> To keep drinking water safe, there are a few tips to keep in mind. When 
outdoors, avoid filtering water in places where human and animal activity is 
always present. For example, when you are in an open field or farm, do not 
filter water where it is close to the cows' or chickens' shed. Indoors, boil 
drinking water for at least one minute. According to an environmentalist, when 
water boils it kills bacteria, viruses and parasites. To remove water's after 
taste, leave the boiled water container and pour the water several times back 
and forth to another clean container. Another way to purify water is by adding 
iodine. This could only be done three times a week in order to avoid health 
issues. Iodine should not be taken by pregnant women. A person should wait 40 
minutes before drinking water with iodine in it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> There are also water filters that are manufactured and sold in different 
stores. When using commercial water filters make sure that the filter is the 
best option for you. There are four different kinds of water filters namely: 
distiller, reverse osmosis, activated carbon water filters and backwash. 
Distillation is boiling water until it evaporates. As water vaporizes the 
contaminants are left behind. The water condenses into pure water. Dissolved 
oxygen is lost during this process. This process is not effective for chemicals 
like ammonia, trihaclomethanes, chloroform, trichloroethylene and phenol. The 
reverse osmosis process involves letting water pass through the membrane 
towards the more concentrated solution. Dissolved oxygen is not lost during 
this process and that is why the water has no after taste. Carbon filters are 
used to treat the taste and removes odors. Carbon absorbs the water 
contaminants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Water Conservation
<p> </p>
<p> When we conserve water, we sustain and help reduce the demand for water 
supply. We protect our rivers and lakes. We use fewer chemicals to treat our 
aquifers and use less energy to heat water. We save electricity because we pump 
less. That would mean savings for our water bills too. We can save water inside 
and outside of our homes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At Home</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At home use green cleaning chemicals when doing house chores. Put a bottle 
of pebbles inside the toilet tank to displace the water and use less water when 
we flush. Turn off the water when brushing your teeth. That saves water about 
one or more gallons of water per day depending on the number of people in a 
household. Take quick showers and save 150 gallons per month. Save the cold 
water in a container while waiting for hot water to reach the shower head. Wash 
dishes by hand. Avoid leaving the water on when rinsing. Use one sink to soap 
and the other sink to rinse and save 200 to 500 gallons per month. Use the 
least amount of detergent because it minimizes the rinse water needed. It saves 
50-150 gallons a month. Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator. 
When you get drinking water from the tap and store it in a glass pitcher or a 
jar, one could save hundreds of gallons per month. Rinse fruits or vegetables 
by using a filled sink or a pan of water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Outside the Home</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Whenever the children want to cool off, use the water sprinkler in an area 
where the lawn needs it most. Share water saving tips with friends. Do not play 
with the garden hoses and save 10 gallons of water per minute. Turn faucets off 
when not in use. Throw left over ice on plants. Collect rain water for the 
garden with overflow ports and secure the lid for child safety. Children can 
easily do the water tips to conserve water. There are many other ways to save 
water. Be smart and use water wisely. Every drop of water that we can save is 
worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Classroom Activities 
<p> </p>
<p> I will use the same strategies that are mentioned earlier for teaching 
reading/science. Before reading aloud the story to the students, I will give a 
set of vocabulary cards and</p>
<p> using pictures. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. I 
will make a word list on chart paper; match each word with its meaning. For 
second language learners, it is important that the words match the pictures. I 
will also give each student a letter of the alphabet and, as I read the story, 
I will ask the students to stand up and give a copy of the poem and science 
information that goes with the letter. To check for student understanding, I 
will prepare comprehension purpose questions for the students to answer as I 
read along and write them on small sticky notes.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Activity One: Introduction to the Unit
<p> </p>
<p> The purpose of the activity is to engage the student with the given topic, 
&quot;Water&quot;. So introduce the unit in a power point presentation with 
Question and Answer. Ask: &quot;Did you know&hellip;&quot; For example: Did you 
know that it takes 15-30 gallons of water to take a shower? (15 gallons of 
milk). Did you know that it takes 180 gallons to water the lawn? (180 gallons 
of milk). Give about 10 questions. Allow time for the students to process 
information. Use their prior knowledge and, from the students' responses, 
explain the important facts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> For the hands on activity, let the students work on density of water. Use 
different cans of soda and explore which cans sink or float (diet soda will 
float and non-diet soda will sink. Discuss students' responses and allow time 
to process their observations. Make a work in progress vocabulary word list. 
Start with the words water and density. Get students to give their own meaning 
of density and then explain the concept. Density is the measure of how solid 
something is. Provide the handout, organize the class in groups of four, read 
aloud the handout (materials and procedure, discuss, and do a follow-up 
activity. Create a teacher made assessment at the end the lesson and 
student/teacher made rubric</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Activity Two: The History of Water
<p> </p>
<p> This book describes the story of water, its origin, and importance. The 
story begins with a picture of a boy looking at a glass of water and asking the 
question where water comes from. As the reader turns the pages of the book, it 
answers the question with vivid, colorful illustrations and facts about water. 
It explains the existence of water billions of years ago. The Earth's first 
plants and animals lived because of water; even the extinct dinosaurs needed 
water. Presently, a drop in a boy's drink continues to provide water for life 
from the smallest flowers to the tallest trees in the rain forests. Plants and 
animals need water to make their food. This book will catch the interest of 
children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> One of the activities that student will work on will be a story foldable. 
Use a piece of construction paper, fold it lengthwise and cut it into three 
equal parts. The student will draw pictures of what happened first, what 
happened next and what happened last. The students will write in their science 
journals three reasons why water is important to all living organisms. Create a 
teacher made assessment at the end the lesson and student/teacher made rubric
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Activity Three: S is for Save the Earth
<p> </p>
<p> For the book, &quot;S is for Save the Earth&quot;. I will use the alphabet 
activity. Each student will get one letter of the alphabet and as I read aloud 
they will read the text and the information given. For vocabulary development, 
I will use the Frayer Model graphic organizer. Students will write the word or 
key concept, write the meaning using their own words, and write its 
characteristics; teachers will give an example and a non-example. Each letter 
of the alphabet is in poetry form. At the end of the lesson, the students who 
are working in groups of four will create their group's alphabet book. The 
science facts are given for each letter of the alphabet. Allow the students to 
explain them with the teachers' guidance. Teachers choose an alphabet and 
create a larger version, of the poem on chart paper. For handout, make smaller 
copies of the poem for the students (whole class). Read aloud the poem to the 
students. For the second reading, students work in pairs and read the poem 
together. Engage students in a discussion. Teach a mini lesson on how to write 
a haiku, model it and write teacher's haiku on chart paper. Tell the students 
to create their own haiku. The next meeting will be a science mini lesson on 
green chemistry's first principle. Create a teacher made assessment at the end 
the lesson and student/teacher made rubric.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Activity Four: The Lorax 
<p> </p>
<p> The Lorax warned the Once-ler to stop cutting down the truffula trees but 
the Once-ler refused to listen. As a result of his greed, the beautiful place 
where the trufulla trees grew, where the swomee- swans lived, where the 
barbaloots played and ate trufulla seeds, and where the humming fish swam 
became so polluted that everyone left. Using &quot;The Lorax&quot;, this 
activity will focus on the first principle of Green Chemistry, that it is 
better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed. Dr. 
Seuss' powerful message is for readers to be aware of their environmental 
issues and to create Earth friendly action globally. The Once-ler is one of the 
characters in the story. He tells the boy about the Lorax who was lifted away 
using his whisper-ma-phone for the secrets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Read aloud the story to the students. Ask them CPQ questions and discuss 
their responses. Readers will understand that the environmental issues in the 
story are comparable to the environmental concerns of today. Explain that when 
we misuse our natural resources, that would cause land and water pollution. 
Compare and contrast why some plants and animals are in the verge of 
extinction, for the reason that humans are not good keepers of our environment. 
The Lorax warned the Once-ler to stop cutting down the truffula trees but the 
Once-ler refused to listen. Explain that as a result of his greed, the 
beautiful place where the trufulla trees grew, where the swomee-swans lived, 
where the barbaloots played and ate trufulla seeds, and where the humming fish 
swam disappeared. Create a teacher made assessment at the end the lesson and 
student/teacher made rubric.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
Activity Five: Water Celebration
<p> </p>
<p> This is an optional activity. At the end of the water unit, celebrate the 
importance of water in children's lives. Let the students plan their Water 
Celebration with guided instruction. In doing so, students take ownership of 
their activity and become more involve with it. Invite parents, administrators 
and other students to culminate the reading/science content area. Make students 
look into their reading portfolios or science journals to and choose their 
favorite activity. Listening, speaking, reading and writing skills are 
meaningful to them when they showcase their own work. Learning science makes 
meaning as well. Students create or write letters to their parents telling them 
about their thinking and learning as they were doing the different water 
activities. Ask for volunteers for the class presentation. Students can read, 
chant, rap or sing or talk about their favorite green chemistry principle and 
how they could use the principle at home to help them keep water 
&quot;green&quot;. Make this a part of the writing process which is making 
invitations for a small gathering that parents come to school and watch each 
child present. Do revisions for their selected writing pieces such as the haiku 
or summaries written by the students. Put students' samples on a table for 
parents viewing and ask a pair of students to act as &quot;science 
ambassadors&quot; and explain the how each product relate to their learning. As 
part of the presentation, each student/pair of students will do a one minute 
class presentation of their favorite piece of work and give an explanation. 
Invite a speaker from the community who is an expert on drinking water or a 
parent whose work is related to chemistry or an another expert from the 
environmental agency. Have the students create play that is a copy changed 
version of Dr. Seuss, The Lorax. Allow responsible students to choose a 
producer, director, characters, costume designers, etcetera. All activities are 
monitored by the teacher(s). Finally, serve snacks prepared by the students 
like water, lemonade and brownies or cookies. Have fun!</p>
