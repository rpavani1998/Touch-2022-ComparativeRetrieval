<p>Freshly drawn filtered water is the best option for most tea brewers.</p>

 In ancient times, the tea scholar Lu Yu said the best 
water for brewing tea came from the center of a swiftly moving mountain stream. 
Given that few of us have access to clean, fresh mountain water for tea today, 
you may want to consider other options. Here are the main types of water and 
the advantages/disadvantages to using each type of water for tea brewing.<br>

<br> <b>Well Water</b> <br>
 With any pH above 7, it&rsquo;s best to filter 
before brewing to prevent the unwanted flavor of extra minerals.<br>
<br>
 Well 
water poses a special problem for tea brewing because its pH is almost always 
above 7. Test your well water. If it&rsquo;s above about 8.5, it ishard water 
and it will brew into bitter tea. Be sure to filter it.<br>
<br>
 If you bring 
it to just shy of a boil after filtering and you can still smell minerals, 
it&rsquo;s still too hard for tea. Consider using bottled water instead.<br>

<br> <b>Bottled Water</b> <br>
 If you have bad tap water, you may want to 
consider using bottled water to brew tea. Mineral water is toohard 
(mineral-rich) and may leave your tea tasting metallic or harsh. Distilled 
water is too soft (low in minerals) and will brew into flat-tasting tea.<br>

<br> Quality spring water is the optimal bottled water for tea, but some types 
are better than others. The best spring water for tea should be neutral in pH 
(about 7) and in flavor. It should have a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) content 
of 30 parts per million (PPM) or less.<br>
<br>
 If you&rsquo;re deciding 
between spring water and good, filtered tap water, you may also want to 
consider the cost and environmental impact of using bottled water. If your 
filtered tap water is nearly as good as the bottled water, I recommend using 
the tap water.<br>
<br>
<b>Tap Water</b> <br>
 Aside from fresh mountain stream 
water and good-quality bottled spring water, filtered tap water is generally 
the best option for brewing tea. Some neutral-tasting tap water may not even 
need to be filtered.<br>
<br>
Hard water should always be filtered for the best 
tasting tea. However, if you bring it to just shy of a boil and you can still 
smell minerals, it&rsquo;s still too hard for tea. Consider using bottled water 
instead.<br>
<br>
 I use a regular Brita filter, but there are more 
sophisticated water filters on the market for those with specific water 
problems or a desire for truly excellent water. Another good filtration option 
is Japanese bamboo charcoal, which is basically a simplified carbon filter. If 
you are using a filter, it&rsquo;s best to brew with freshly filtered water. 
(Water absorbs odors over time and, if your water has been sitting out in your 
kitchen for a while, you tea&rsquo;s flavor may be negatively impacted.) For 
more information on water filters, here's an article ontypes of water filters 
and a listing oftop pitcher-style water filters. <br>
<br>
 As soft water 
produces flat-tasting tea, some serious tea aficionados warm soft water with 
certain types of rocks in the kettle. This adds a better balance of minerals to 
the water and the final brew. <br>
