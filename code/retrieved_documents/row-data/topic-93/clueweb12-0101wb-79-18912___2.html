About Charleston's Tap Water <br>

<p><br>
Charleston's tap water is clean and safe to drink.&nbsp; Charleston 
Water System meets--and in many cases<em>exceeds</em> the water quality 
standards set by the US EPA and SCDHEC.</p> 
<p>Under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the US EPA has set 
standards for approximately90 contaminants in drinking water in it's national 
primary drinking water regulations. &nbsp;These are enforceable standards that 
may include a legal limit on the level of a contaminant or the requirement of a 
specific treatment technique to remove a particular contaminant.</p> 
<p>Water that meets these standards is safe to drink, although people with 
severely compromised immune systems and children may have special needs.&nbsp; 
Every year, Charleston Water produces awater quality report that is mailed to 
all customers in the May or June water bill showing the results of the sampling 
results throughout the year. </p>

History of Charleston Water System<br>
</p> &nbsp; 
<p></p> 
<p>Did you know...?<br>
 Charleston's tap water comes from the Edisto River 
and the Bushy Park Reservoir. It's treated at the Hanahan Water Treatment 
Plant, which produces an average of 55 million gallons of clean drinking water 
every day.<br>
</p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Lead and Drinking Water <br>

<p><br>
 It was once celebrated for its many uses, but today, lead is best 
known for its health risks. What is the risk of exposure through drinking water 
and what does Charleston Water do to keep lead out of the water? Here&rsquo;s 
what you need to know about lead.</p> 
<p>What is lead?<br>
 Lead is a soft, malleable metal that was used in 
everything from gasoline to water pipes before its health effects forced the 
federal government to limit its use in the 1980s. Before its toxic effects were 
widely known, many water utilities used lead water lines in their distribution 
systems. Lead pipes and solder were also used in home plumbing systems. Today, 
many of these lead lines have been replaced, but some are still in use, and new 
plumbing materials and brass fixtures may legally contain up to 8% lead.</p> 
<p>What are the health effects of lead?<br>
Short term exposure to high levels 
of lead can interfere with normal development in babies and young children, and 
may cause slight increases in the blood pressure of some adults. The effects of 
long-term exposure to elevated levels are more serious, and may include stroke, 
kidney disease, and cancer.</p> 
<p>How does lead get into drinking water?<br>
 Lead does not occur naturally 
in water. It gets into drinking water by leaching from lead pipes or plumbing 
materials. Water utilities no longer use lead pipes, but some plumbing 
fixtures, such as brass faucets, by law may contain up to 8% lead. Homes built 
before 1986 may have plumbing materials such as solder containing a higher 
percentage of lead.</p> 
<p>Lead pipes are more commonly found in older cities, where lead service 
lines were installed before the health effect of lead were known. The EPA 
estimates that 20% of human exposure to lead is attributable to drinking water. 
The most common lead exposure is ingestion of dust or particles containing 
lead-based paint.</p> 
<p>How do water utilities control the levels of lead in water?<br>
 Because 
lead leaches into water by the corrosion of lead pipes in homes, utilities 
control lead levels by reducing the corrosiveness of water. Charleston Water 
System adds a compound called orthophosphate to water during the treatment 
process, which prevents corrosion by forming a molecular barrier between the 
pipe and the water inside.</p> 
<p>Does the government regulate lead levels?<br>
 Yes, lead in drinking water 
is regulated by US EPA through theLead and Copper Rule. The rule requires 
utilities to test tap water from a certain number of homes that have lead 
plumbing. If the lead levels are higher than 15 parts per billion (ppb) in more 
than 10% of the homes sampled, then the utility must take certain actions, 
including public notification, and efforts to reduce the corrosiveness of water.
</p> 
<p>Water samples taken from Charleston homes with lead plumbing showed lead 
levels of 4 parts per billion, well below the EPA limit of 15 ppb.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about lead plumbing in your home&hellip;<br>
 
Even if you have lead plumbing, compounds added to the water at the treatment 
plant will prevent lead from leaching into the water. However, you may follow 
these tips to further protect yourself:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t used tap water in several hours, let the cold water 
faucet run for one minute before using the water.</li> 
<li> This will flush out standing water in your home&rsquo;s pipes.</li> 
<li> Only use cold water for cooking and drinking. Lead leaches more easily 
into hot water.</li> 
<li> Charleston Water System will test your water free of charge. Call 
727-6800 to request a testing kit.<br>
</li> </ul> &nbsp; <br>
<br>
 Did you 
know...?<br>
Lead was widely used in ancient Rome to make everything from 
make-up to pottery glazes and wine preservatives. It was also used to build 
water pipes. In fact, the word plumbing comes from the Latin word for lead, 
plumbum. 
<p>Lead poisoning in children is almost always caused by exposure to 
lead-based paint. Peeling paint inside homes built in the 1950s or earlier and 
paint chips in dust and soil can easily be swallowed by a child. A blood test 
can screen a child for lead poisoning.</p> <br>

Fluoride in 
Drinking Water <br>

<p><br>
 Many communities add fluoride to drinking water, a practice that 
began in 1945 and is widely supported by public health organizations such as 
the American Dental Association, the Centers for Disease Control, and the SC 
Department of Health and Environmental Control.</p> 
<p>Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that when consumed at the 
recommended level, helps prevent tooth decay in children and adults. While 
fluoride occurs naturally in some water sources, in many communities, such as 
Charleston, it&rsquo;s also added during the water treatment process.</p> 
<p> The&nbsp;optimal concentration of fluoride, as recommended by the CDC and 
US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is 0.7 parts per million 
(ppm).&nbsp;The HHS updated this recommended level in January 2011 (learn more
). Previously, the optimal level was a range between 0.7 ppm and 1.2 ppm. It 
was reduced to 0.7 ppm to prevent overexposure to fluoride, as many children 
receive fluoride through toothpaste, mouth rinses, etc.</p> 
<p>Charleston Water System's target concentration of fluoride is 0.7 ppm.</p> 
<p>Dozens of scientific studies have shown water fluoridation to be safe and 
effective. According to the CDC, about 66% of communities in the US have 
fluoridated drinking water.</p>

<br>
 Did you know&hellip;?<br>
The benefits of 
fluoride were discovered in 1931, after researchers discovered that high levels 
of naturally occurring fluoride caused tooth staining<em>and</em> fewer 
cavities for children in a Colorado town.<br>
 Further studies found that 
reducing the amount of fluoride in drinking water produced the benefit of fewer 
cavities without staining teeth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Is Bottled 
Water Better? <br>
<br>
Bottled water is the second largest commercial beverage 
category in the US&mdash;and sales are showing no signs of slowing.&nbsp; 
Despite its higher cost compared to tap water, bottled water is the fastest 
growing segment of the beverage industry, and is second in popularity only to 
soft drinks. Bottled water is an $8.2 billion per-year industry, producing some 
6.4 billion gallons of water in 2003, up 7% from 2002. 
<p>Studies show that people buy bottled water for a variety of reasons: 
it&rsquo;s convenient, it&rsquo;s a healthier option than sugary sodas or fruit 
juices, it tastes good&mdash;the list goes on. Bottled water sales are driven 
in part by marketing strategies that tout bottled water as cleaner and safer to 
drink than tap water. But for people who live in areas served by a water 
utility such as CPW that meets drinking water standards, is paying a dollar or 
more for a bottle of water worth it? Here are some facts to consider.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bottled water companies are regulated by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and are held to 
different, less stringent standards than water utilities, which are regulated 
by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the federal Safe Drinking 
Water Act.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Monitoring and enforcement of FDA standards for bottled water companies is 
weak compared to the EPA&rsquo;s monitoring of water utilities. The 
International Bottled Water Association, in coordination with the National 
Sanitation Foundation (NSF) has established voluntary standards and grants a 
seal of approval to all bottled waters that meet the standards. A list of 
brands is available at www.nsf.org or by calling 1-877-8-NSF-HELP.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Average cost: Charleston Water System tap water&mdash;less than a penny 
per gallon ($0.007/gallon). Bottled water&mdash;approximately a dollar per 
gallon.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Bottled water that meets FDA standards is safe to drink, and is good to 
store for emergencies. Charleston Water System tap water meets all EPA 
standards, and is also safe to store for emergencies.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Tap water contains trace amounts of a disinfectant to protect against 
bacteria and microbes, but most bottled water does not. For this reason, 
bottled water that has been opened should not be stored for a prolonged period 
of time, as microbes may begin to grow.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Most bottled water does not contain fluoride, which is added to Charleston 
Water's drinking water at safe levels recommended by theAmerican Dental 
Association. Fluoride helps prevent tooth decay in children. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>A 1999 study by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) tested some 1,000 
bottles of water and found that bottled water is no better that tap water from 
a well-run utility. <br>
<br>
</li> </ul> &nbsp; 
<p><br>
<br>
 Did you know&hellip;?<br>
There are more than 700 brands of 
bottled water in the United States.<br>
<br>
 The Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) estimates that access to fluoridated tap water reduces incidence of tooth 
decay from 18 to 40 percent.</p> 
<p>In a 2004 survey of Charleston Water System customers, 49% reported 
drinking tap water only, 41% drink a combination of tap and bottled water, and 
10% said they drink bottled water only.</p>

The 
Facts About Filters <br>

<p><br>
For those who don&rsquo;t want to buy bottled water, home water 
purification systems, called point-of-use (POU) devices, are a popular 
alternative. There are a variety of systems on the market that are designed to 
remove different contaminants from the water, and they vary in price&mdash;from 
$25 for a simple faucet filter to several thousand dollars for systems that 
treats water as it enters a home&rsquo;s plumbing system. Before you buy, here 
are some facts to consider: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Charleston Water System tap water meets or exceeds all drinking water 
standards and is safe to drink unless your immune system is severely 
compromised. You do not need a water filter to make your water safe to drink. 
For people with severely compromised immune systems, a doctor may recommend a 
certain brand of water purification device or certain bottled waters.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li>No purification system can remove 100% of contaminants in water. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>There are no federal regulations requiring water filter companies to test 
their products or prove they actually remove the compounds they claim to 
remove. TheNational Sanitation Foundation (NSF), a non-profit organization that 
tests and certifies products, including water filters, has a list of certified 
filters available at www.nsf.org or by calling 1-877-8-NSF-HELP.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Not all filters are designed to remove all compounds. Some only remove 
harmless compounds that affect the taste and smell of water, while others are 
capable of removing bacteria or minerals. Be sure you know what a filter is 
made to remove before you buy.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If you want to improve the taste or odor of your water, a carbon filter is 
usually most appropriate.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Be sure to follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions for changing the 
filter in your unit. Failing to do so may actually introduce contaminants into 
your drinking water.</li> </ul> 
<p><br>
</p> &nbsp; 
<p><br>
<br>
 Did you know...?<br>
Boiling water for at least one minute is 
effective at sterilizing water against bacteria.</p> 
<p><br>
 Cold water has less of a taste than warm water. Try refrigerating a 
pitcher of tap water for a more refreshing drink.</p>

Pharmaceuticals in Drinking 
Water <br>

<p><br>
 From antibacterial soap to prescription and over-the-counter 
medications, almost everyone uses pharmaceuticals and personal health care 
products, called PPCPs.</p> 
<p>These products contain a wide variety of chemical compounds--compounds that 
wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove. As a result, studies 
have found that trace amounts of these compounds are turning up in our nation's 
water bodies, and potentially, in our drinking water.</p> 
<p>Advances in technology now enable laboratories to detect these compounds in 
water at incredibly small levels---down to parts pertrillion. There is no 
evidence of any impact on human health at this level, and federal and state 
regulations do not require testing for these compounds or establish limits in 
drinking water. In fact, studies show exposure to these compounds exists in 
many food and beverage products at higher levels.</p> 
<p> However, recognizing the importance of this issue, Charleston Water System 
had its source water and treated drinking water tested for a variety of these 
compounds. Of the 36 compounds tested for, only three were shown to be present 
in Charleston's treated drinking water at the parts-per-trillion level: 
caffeine, phenol (a compound in wood and cleaning products), an TDCPP (a flame 
retardant compound).</p> 
<p>It is important to note that Charleston Water System meets or exceeds all 
regulations for drinking water, and is closely following the research on this 
topic.</p>

siteand the American Water Works Association web site. </p>

<p>How you can help:<br>
 Proper disposal of prescription medicines</p> 
<p>One way that trace amounts of pharmaceuticals end up in the water 
environment is from leftover drugs being flushed down the toilet. You can help 
prevent this by properly disposing of prescription medications.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take unused or expired medications out of their original containers and 
throw the containers in the trash.</li> 
<li>Mix prescription drugs with coffee grounds or kitty litter dispose in the 
trash in an empty can or plastic bag.</li> 
<li>Do not flush medications down the toilet unless the label or accompanying 
patient information specifically instructs you to do so.</li> 
<li>If you have questions, ask your pharmacist.</li> </ul> 
<p>These guidelines are from the Office of National Drug Control Policy and 
are supported by SC DHEC.</p>
