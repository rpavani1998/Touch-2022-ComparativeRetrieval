<h3> Step into Summer - ABC Neckties Partiotic Flag Necktie Review and $25 
Gift Certificate Giveaway {CLOSED} </h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to our Step 
into Summer event! Jennifer and I have some wonderful things lined up for you 
to help you get ready for summer. Make sure you visit Jennifer at Eighty MPH Mom
 daily to see what she has in store for you too. Many days we will be reviewing 
and giving away the same item on both blogs - that is two chances for you to 
win! <br>
<br>
<br>
The Man's not really big on ties. In fact I've only seen 
him wear them on a handful of occasions. Our son, on the other hand is the 
complete opposite. Heloves ties and bow ties. In fact, he sued to have little 
clip on ties when he was younger. He'd wear those things all over the place. 
You should have seen him recently when he was standing up in a friend's 
wedding. He thought he was the coolest thing ever with his little tie on!<br>

<br> The Fourth of July is fast approaching. In fact, it's only 4 days away! My 
Lil Man will be sporting thePatriotic Flag Necktie shown above all around the 
park that day. He'll be super stylish and sporting his country's colors all at 
the same time. This tie really is cool looking. You can't tell from the 
picture, but there's swirls in it that give it some definition and just make it 
look cooler all around.<br>
<br>
ABC Neckties carries an assortment of 
patriotic ties and armed services ties so you can show off your pride for this 
wonderful country we live in this Independence Day. After all, we will be 
celebrating our freedom, and that is definitely something to celebrate!<br>
<br>
Buy It! <br>
<br>
You can buy the Partiotic Flag Necktie for $11.01. <br>

<h3> Presto Cool Touch Electric Tilt' N' Drain Big Griddle Review </h3> <br>
 
I am definitely a breakfast person. I love breakfast. it's my favorite meal of 
the day. I make breakfast pretty often for my family. Sometimes, it is the most 
pain in the butt meal to cook though. I'm using at least 3 pans at a time and 
sometimes I even use more and have to cook things once something else is done.
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
Then the Presto Cool Touch Electric Tilt' N' Drain Big 
Griddle came to the rescue and made my life so much easier. It has a huge 
surface, 18 1/2&quot; x 15&quot; to be exact. It's almost twice the size of 
othergriddles I've seen! I can cook our whole breakfast on here. It comes in 
handy on those days when I make a huge breakfast too because I can cook on this 
and the stove top. That way everything is cooking at the same time, perfect!<br>
<br>It has a Tilt'N' Drain feature which allows you to switch to a tilted 
surface to drain fat and grease from meats such as bacon. You can also immerse 
the griddle in water with the heat control removed. That makes for super easy 
cleanup!<br>
<br>
Buy It! <br>
<br>
You can buy the Presto Cool Touch Electric 
Tilt' N' Drain Big Griddle from Cookware.com, one ofCSN Stores family of 200+ 
stores for $49.99.<br>

Review <br>

<h3> What's Been Keeping Me? </h3> <br>
 I know the personal posts have 
totally been lacking lately. Alright, I take that back. They've been non 
existent! I feel bad for that. I really do. There just wasn't time.<br>
<br>

Memorial Day weekend came and our Summer began. If we weren't out somewhere 
doing something, we had people here hanging out in our backyard. Honestly, I 
think this has been the busiest Summer we've had so far. I'm not saying it 
hasn't been fun. It's been a hell of a time, I tell you! We have enjoyed almost 
every minute of it!<br>
<br>
We've been swimming. <br>
We've been grilling out. 
<br>We've gone boating. <br>
We've gone to birthday parties. <br>
We've gone 
camping.<br>
We've gone to the park. <br>
We've gone swimming. <br>
<br>
Yeah I 
know, you get it!<br>
<br>
I did do a Wordless Wednesday post today though with 
some pics of baby birds in our grape vines. That's as personal as it gets for 
now, I suppose.<br>
<br>
I have a bunch of reviews to catch up on and Jennifer 
and I will get the Step into Summer event back on track. I'm hoping to get back 
on track, if not ahead of myself today. Technically, I have the whole day to do 
it, but we'll see how the kids handle that. I'm sure they're gonna be itching 
to get out of the house!<br>

three songs on a CD. That's definitelynot the case here. I love all the songs! 
It's hard to narrow it down and choose one favorite. If I had to pick though, 
it would be Loving You is Easy. I absolutely LOVE that song! You can listen to 
it below and watch Sarah perform at Dancing with the Stars. I bet you'll love 
it too!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That's not it though. Laws of Illusion is chocked 
full of great songs, 12 to be exact.<br>

2. ILLUSIONS 
OF BLISS<br>

4. CHANGES <br>
5. FORGIVENESS <br>

<h3> Wordless Wednesday - Baby Birds </h3> <br>
 Our fence in the backyard is 
covered in a grape vine. it's so thick that it's almost like a privacy fence 
from the neighbors yard. Our dog was trying to get something by it's thickest 
part the other day so the Man walked over to check it out. These baby birds are 
what we found inside. They made a little nest inside the grape vines. Pretty 
cool, hey! I think it's awesome because our yard is small and there isn't a 
single tree in it. So who says you have to have a tree to have birds nests?<br>

<h3> The Zuvo Water Filtration System Review &amp; Giveaway {CLOSED} </h3> <br>
<br> <strong></strong> 
<blockquote> <strong>&quot;Better for your health</strong> <br>
The Zuvo Water 
Filtration System replicates nature's water-cleansing process, reducing 
contaminants while preserving your water's natural and healthy mineral content. 
<strong>Better for your wallet</strong> <br>
Over time, Zuvo costs a fraction 
of what you'll spend on bottled water or pitcher filters. <strong>Better for 
the planet</strong> <br>
With Zuvo, you can make a difference by not adding to 
the more than 60 million plastic water bottles that end up in our landfills 
every day.&quot; </blockquote> 
<p> </p> <br>
<br>
<br>
Clean water is very important to me. In fact, it's so 
important that I stopped drinking water from our tap. I started buying bottled 
water years ago.<br>
<br>
Not only is bottled water extremely expensive over 
time, but those plastic bottles really aren't good for the environment. They 
just sit there, and fill up landfills.<br>
<br>
When presented with the 
opportunity to try theZuvo Water Filtration System, of course I jumped at it. I 
knew that this would be perfect in my house and perfect for my family. It would 
save us money over time and instead of having to go to the store, buy the 
bottles of water and store them, I could just attach this right to my faucet 
and be done. In essence, it saved me time too.<br>
<br>
My youngest son 
definitely drinks the most water in the house. He loves it. He has these 
resusable bottles that he never used all that often since he didn't like the 
taste of the water from the tap. Now he uses them all the time thanks to the 
Zuvo Water Filtration System. Of course, he did take one with to the fireworks 
the other night and accidentally left it at the lake!<br>
<br>
I think our 
water definitely tastes better and I know that it's definitely healthier than 
our normal tap water would be without it. That peace of mind alone is 
definitely worth it!<br>
The Zuvo Water Filtration System can be installed 
above or under the counter, whichever works best for you. Check out the images 
and description below for more information about both options.<br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;For those who prefer a countertop installation, the Zuvo 
Water Filtration System easily and quickly connects directly to most standard 
faucets. In minutes, you will be getting clean, healthy, great tasting water 
right from your tap.&quot;</blockquote> <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;For those that prefer an under-counter installation, the 
Zuvo Water Filtration System can also be easily installed under the counter and 
connected directly to a Zuvo Butler Faucet.&quot;</blockquote> <br>
<br>
Buy It!
<br> <br>
You can buy the Zuvo Water Filtration System for $299.99. <br>

System? I have one to give away to one lucky contestant!<br>

<h3> I Can Breathe Again </h3> <br>
 This Summer really kicked off with a 
bang. We have been so busy, almost non stop since Memorial Day weekend. I was 
honestly starting to feel a little bit overwhelmed with how busy things were 
for us, trying to get posts done and working on the Step into Summer event. I 
think I finally realized that I amnot Super Woman and I really cannot handle it 
all, no matter how much I would like to.<br>
<br>
I've neglected my blog. I've 
neglected my house. I've completely neglected my beading. I haven't touched any 
of that stuff in about a month. There's just not enough time in the day to get 
everything done that needs to be done, and everything that I {and my family} 
want to do.<br>
<br>
The only thing that hasn't been neglected is my family, 
spending time with them and enjoying the summertime. I suppose, that really is 
all that matters though, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Jennifer { Eighty MPH Mom} and I 
were just chatting a few minutes ago, and she's having issues with her blog 
right now. If any of you are regular readers of hers, then you know she just 
switched to Wordpress. She's having some major issues and actually had to chose 
down comments yesterday.<br>
<br>
Update: Jennifer's blog is working and the 
event will be up and running again in just a couple of days. Her comments are 
open now, so feel free to head over there and enter her giveaways :)<br>
<br>

In light of her blog issues and my time issue, we have decided to put a hold on 
the Step into Summer event for just a few days. I need to catch up on things in 
my house and with my blog. She needs to figure out what's wrong with her blog. 
Basically we both need a moment to breathe, catch our bearings and take care of 
things that need to be taken care of.<br>
<br>
I hope you all understand, and 
we promise not to leave you hanging too long. We have some great stuff up our 
sleeves and some awesome giveaways to share with you!<br>

<h2>Monday, June 28, 2010</h2> 
<h3> Traditonal Fourth of July Celebration with Sam's Club </h3> <br>
 We do 
quite a few cook outs every year. Ok, I may have underestimated that just a 
tad. We cook out pretty often, whether it be at my house or another person's 
house. Sometimes we'll just all get together at the spur of the moment and have 
a big feast. Summertime is definitely a busy time of the year around here!<br>

<br> Fourth of July is one of our biggest celebrations. A huge group of family, 
friends and all of their family and friends get together at a local park and 
make a whole day of it. We fire up the grill and cook all day as people come 
and go. It's always such a great time and this year will be no exception. I 
can't wait!<br>
<br>
Sam's Club has you covered for your Fourth of July 
celebration and I was able to have a preview party thanks to them. Of course, 
mine was a little bit scaled down compared to normal, but there was no way I 
could fit all those people in my yard! I chose theTraditional Fourth Celebration
 and it couldn't have worked out better for us. But hey everyone's parties 
differ, so check out theGourmet, Kid Friendly, On the Go and Big Party Fourth 
Celebrations to see which one would fit your party style.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sam's 
Club sent me everything I needed to make my party a success including food, 
plates, napkins and even Croquet! It was so great because I didn't have to cook 
anything but the beans since the Man does all the grilling around here! We went 
tubing the day of the party, so it got started a bit late the way it was. I was 
so glad that everything was already prepared and I just had to slice up a 
watermelon.<br>
<br>
As you can see, it was already dark by the time we started 
eating. That sure didn't matter much though. Everyone loved the food and for 
once I couldn't really accept the compliment for making it. The potato salad 
was especially good and a heck of a lot cheaper than buying it from the 
grocer's deli.<br>
<br>
Those hamburger patties you see down there were just 
frozen patties, but with a little bit of salt, pepper and seasoning salt they 
turned out awesome and everyone loved them!<br>
<br>
<br>
Our party was a huge 
hit and honestly the best part of it for me was not having to make much. We had 
plenty of leftovers too! Check outwww3.samsclub.com/summer for party and menu 
ideas of of course some tasty recipes!<br>
<br>
Sam&rsquo;s Club provided me 
with a full 4th of July party pack of items and a $100 gift card for my 
participation in this campaign. Opinions expressed are my own or my families 
and are not influenced by any form of compensation. Take it or leave it.Click

<h3> Step into Summer - Jockey Underwear Review and $50 Gift Certificate 
Giveaway {CLOSED} </h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to our Step into Summer event! 
Jennifer and I have some wonderful things lined up for you to help you get 
ready for summer. Make sure you visit Jennifer at Eighty MPH Mom daily to see 
what she has in store for you too. Many days we will be reviewing and giving 
away the same item on both blogs - that is two chances for you to win! <br>
<br>
<br>Can you believe that I have never worn Jockey underwear before? I know, 
pretty crazy! Well that's all changed now and I have to say we are both quite 
impressed. I received an assortment of different styles for me and for him and 
we both like them. He especially likes theSport Performance Boxer Brief &ndash; 
2 pack he was able to try out. He said they are the most comfortable underwear 
he's worn. I think they look great too and I am usually a boxer only kinda 
girl. Well he can wear these boxer briefs any day!<br>
<br>
Many of the 
products I received are part of Jockey&rsquo;s Top 5 Styles for Summer and I'll 
tell you all about them below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Naturals: <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;See our most enchanting collection come to life. With 
smooth and seamless styles you&rsquo;ll feel at east&hellip;naturally&quot;
</blockquote>I received a cami and panties from this collection and I just love 
the style and comfort of them. These are definitely one of my favorite pair of 
panties because they are super comfortable. I really like the lime wash color 
too.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Minis: <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;Where comfy meets flirty. Fun, low rise styles with a 
cheeky look.&quot;</blockquote> <br>
I think this collection is super cute and 
sexy at the same time. There are a whole bunch of different styles including 
low rise hipsters and even a super sexy lace cami.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
No Panty Line Promise&reg; Tactel&reg; collection: <br>
<br>
Some 
clothes can be so unflattering if you can see panty lines. That's where this 
collection totally comes in handy. There are 6 styles of panties, 2 camis and a 
chemise to choose from to go with any look you're trying to achieve.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Supersoft: <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;Our spandex/micromodal&reg; fabric blend feels softer than 
cotton with a cool, light touch.&quot;</blockquote>Now they weren't kidding 
when they said supersoft. These are definitely soft and comfortable. These were 
one of my favorites for sure! They come in 3 packs and an assortment of 
different styles and colors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Activewear and Sports 
Bras: <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;Whether you are hitting the gym, out for a walk, or showing 
the guys who&rsquo;s boss in a pick-up game, we&rsquo;ve got supportive and 
comfortable styles that will keep you going strong.&quot;</blockquote>Underwear 
isn't all we got from Jockey. I received a pair of crop pants and a sports bra 
and they are both so comfortable and will be perfect for working out.<br>
<br>

I was honestly so thrilled when I opened my box from Jockey because they sent 
so much different stuff for us both to try. We really were able to try quite a 
few of their different products and it was a great experience. We both liked 
everything we tried and it was all a great fit, unlike many other places where 
size is a guessing game... especially when ordering online.<br>
<br>

<h3> Step into Summer - Black &amp; Light 6&quot; Dragonfly - Fern Candle 
Review &amp; Giveaway {CLOSED} </h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to our Step into 
Summer event! Jennifer and I have some wonderful things lined up for you to 
help you get ready for summer. Make sure you visit Jennifer at Eighty MPH Mom 
daily to see what she has in store for you too. Many days we will be reviewing 
and giving away the same item on both blogs - that is two chances for you to 
win! <br>
<br>

<blockquote> &quot;Our family owned business is headed by Holly Eve, our 
founder and a design and candle artisan. Holly combined her two passions, 
helping those around her and her love for candles.<br>
<br>
In early 2007, we 
met the candle maker whose candles Holly always admired. She talked with him 
about her design ideas and her vision as to how they would look on his unique 
and glowing candles. A friendship and partnership ensued. black &amp; 
light&reg; co. was born.&quot;</blockquote> <br>
I am a candle fanatic. My 
house is adorned in them. I amnever without a candle. If we have a storm and 
the power goes out, I never worry. I have enough candles to keep our house lit 
for days. You'd think I'd be fine with that.<br>
<br>
No, I'm not though. I 
look at the candle section of every store I go into. I smell them, I feel them. 
I just may be a candle addict. Hey, we all gotta have something, right?<br>
<br>
Yes. Yes, we do!<br>
<br>
I just can't help but be mesmerized by their glow and 
sometimes their scent. They're calming, romantic and pretty. There's nothing 
better than watching a scary movie with candles lit throughout the room. It 
totally intensifies the eeriness I think!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I was sent the 
6&quot; Dragonfly - Fern and it arrived ever so beautiful in a keepsake gift 
box. In fact, I still have the box. I like it that much. Oh this review isn't 
about the box?<br>
<br>
Oops! It's pretty though, isn't it? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Ok, now on to the candle. Don't mind me, I get sidetracked too easily. First of 
all, I love the dragonflies all over it. They are just too cute! The candle 
looks great alone or on a cute little holder. Since it's already decorated, 
both options work great. They burn great and are pretty long lasting. I've 
burned for about 5 hours and have barely put a dent in the candle.<br>
<br>

Black &amp; Light offers a variety of lovely decorative candles. They even have 
ones with butterflies, which I was so tempted to get! Next time, for sure!<br>

<br> Buy It! <br>
<br>
You can buy the 6&quot; Dragonfly - Fern candle for $34 
which includes the gift box.<br>
<br>
The Giveaway<br>

One lucky 
person will win their choice of candle from Black &amp; Light!<br>
