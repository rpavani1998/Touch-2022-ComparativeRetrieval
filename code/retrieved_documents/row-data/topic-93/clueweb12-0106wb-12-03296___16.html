<br>  The importance of clean water for Venus Fly Traps <br>
<br>
 Written by 
Matt &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Sunday, 30 March 2008 13:34 <br>

<p>Using pure water is essential to the health of a Venus Fly Trap. In 
general, tap water is not a good idea. The dissolved solids that are in tap 
water - namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium 
- are detrimental to the health of your Dionaea. Although it may not be 
immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will 
begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and 
eventually death of the plant.</p> 
<p>Venus Fly Traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered 
with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an RO system). 
However regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a TDS 
(total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a TDS measurement of less than 
50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for Venus Flytraps and other 
carnivorous plants. Although higher levels of TDS can be tolerated (up to 100 
ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to 
be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several 
hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the 
growing medium) once per year or so.</p> 
<p>During their active growing season, Venus Flytraps should be monitored, 
especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does 
not dry out completely. The growing medium ideally should be just moist, not 
soggy or waterlogged. Therefore the tray method (described and pictured below) 
is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or 
when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely. 
Otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to 
water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again. 
It is especially important during theirdormancy to avoid wet conditions when it 
is very cool or cold at the same time. Because the plants should be kept cool 
for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing 
medium to become almost dry before watering again. Sometimes this means 
watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on 
weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots 
often retain water for a longer period). So keeping the plant and medium 
&quot;moist, not wet&quot; most of the time is a good general rule, and it 
should be less moist most of the time during its dormancy when the air is cool 
to cold.</p> 
<p>One way to water a Venus Flytrap is the <b>tray method</b>. Below you will 
see a photo of the tray method which involves setting a pot with drainage holes 
in the bottom of it in a tray of distilled or other pure water. Mostmedia (soil)
 that Venus Fly Traps are potted in is very good at retaining water. The media 
will soak up water from a tray or bowl almost like a sponge.The tray method 
works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, 
and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check 
one's plants. However, the tray method is often not a good method to use all 
the time (see the paragraph above).</p>

<br> TERRERIUM - do I need to water it at all? <br>
written by Alan King, July 
31, 2008 <br>
 Hi There from the UK <br>
<br>
If I have flytraps in a terrarium 
- is the natural condensation which forms enough to keep the plants healthy or 
should I water as well?<br>
<br>
Any tips would be appreciated <br>
<br>

helpful site by the way

Re: TERRARIUM - do I need to water it at all? <br>

written byMatt, August 01, 2008 <br>
 You will definitely still have to water 
them. Do you have any particular reason for growing them in a terrarium? Venus 
Fly Traps don't usually make very good terrarium pets. It's possible to grow 
them in terrariums, but they are healthier and more robust if they are grown 
outside.<br>
<br>
If you have any more questions, you should join the forum and 
ask them there. I hope to hear more about your growing experiences on the 
forum. Best of luck with your flytraps!

Chlorine water <br>
written by Dom, August 08, 2008 <br>

 I watered my first trap with chlorine water for a week or two but when i got 
two new flytraps i started watering with rain water i collected. ive been doing 
this for almost a week. I noticed the first trap i got was starting to get 
little wrinkles and now one part of it has a very subtle tinge of light brown i 
noticed. is this the water? how do i correct this?

Re: Chlorine Water <br>
written by Matt, August 08, 2008 
<br>  It could be the water. It depends on what method you are using to collect 
it. If you are sure that it is clean, then it could be something else. You 
might want to try repotting into new, clean media and water with distilled 
water only for a month or so to see if the plants recover.

 Arrowhead water will likely not be safe. You need to make sure you 
use distilled water. Feel free to ask questions like this in the forum!

Well water? <br>

Would well water be okay for a venus flytrap? My town has no public water

Re: Well water? <br>
written by Matt, January 08, 2009 
<br>  Unfortunately no Tom, well water isn't ok for venus fly traps. Any type 
of ground water will usually have a lot of dissolved solids in it, which can 
accumulate in the media and poison your plant. You should collect rain water, 
melt snow or buy distilled water for your plant.

Just got my seeds! <br>
written by Scott, February 12, 
2009 <br>
 Hi there, <br>
<br>
Just got my seeds, i've put the pot of soil 
(correct soil i was given with the seeds) in a tray of rain water untill the 
top soil is wet / damp, now it's time to put the seeds in!<br>
<br>
Questions: 
<br> <br>
1) Do I sprinkle the seeds on the top or make a little hole and plant 
them then cover it over?<br>
<br>
2) How oftern do you water them? <br>
<br>

Many thanks!<br>

You'll find tons of information on this in the 
forum, but basically you just sprinkle the seeds on top of the peat moss and 
keep them very moist until they germinate then you put them in a sunny 
windowsill to continue growing.

No germination visable <br>
written by Dan, February 28, 
2009 <br>
 I bought a Venus Fly Trap seed kit sometime in January and it told 
me to prepare the seeds by imitating a dormancy period first. So as it said, I 
put the seeds in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 weeks and then planted 
them in a pot with a sand/acidic soil mixture. It's completely damp and sealed 
inside a plastic bag. The next step was to put it in direct sunlight. I've 
tried setting it under a south facing window and then under a bright 
fluorescent plant light. I have yet to see any growth for about a month.<br>

<br>Am I doing anything wrong? Or does it just take a little longer?

<br>
In any 
case, your seeds might need longer to germinate, or they might never germinate. 
Seed kits aren't very good to try for a first timer. The seeds have usually set 
on the shelf for too long and aren't viable any longer.

How To Water My Plants? <br>
written by Datter, March 
08, 2009 <br>
 Despite the description you gave, I am still abit confused. To 
prevent stagnation, can I choose not to place my flytrap on a bowl with water 
on it and just use a spray bottle to spray some water at the plant? Secondly, 
can I use boiled tap water to water my plants?<br>
 Many Thanks! <br>

 Questions are actually meant for the forum. You can join the 
forum by clicking on the Forum link at the top or right side of any page.<br>

<br>Quick answers to your questions: <br>
1) Some people top water their 
plants, but usually misting doesn't do much. Bottom watering is the preferred 
method.<br>
2) No, boiled tap water is actually worse for your plants than 
regular tap water. Boiling the water increases the amount of dissolved solids 
by making the clean water evaporate.

Pur water <br>

 I 
currently just got a venus fly trap. I currently put in a cap's measurement 
(the cap from the arrowhead bottle) of arrowhead before reading the information

Filtered water usually won't do. You should try to use distilled water, rain

Standing Water <br>
written by Ian, April 23, 2009 <br>
 
Really, just don't use tap water. Distilled, Rain, or RO water only-at least 
untill you gain experience :-).<br>
<br>
Standing water can be detrimental to 
the Venus Flytrap. They are prone to rot (as [Matt] you probably know). It is 
best to let the water disapear for a little bit before adding water to the 
tray, as long as they don't dry out. Dry kills. Too much water kills. 
Overwatering often leads to sudden death; therefore it is best to keep the soil 
moist, but never wet. No water should be vissible if you happen to press on the 
soil.<br>
<br>
Larger pots allow for more mistakes, and beginners make 
mistakes, so I recommend a 4-6 inch pot. The six inchers can accomodate even 
the most mature flytraps.<br>
<br>
Great Job Matt, <br>
<br>
and happy growing 
for the rest of you.

 I just happened to be browsing google on venus fly traps and came across this 
site which I found very helpful. I couldn't help but laugh though after seeing 
the request to post questions in the forum and the very next post would be 
another question! Anywho, thank you very much for all the articles and a forum 
for questions. <br>

Rain water <br>
written by LFTal_81, May 16, 2010 <br>
 
hi all.<br>
One important thing i have noticed with the death of my last VFT. 
<br>I live in a area with lots of air pollution including an petrochemical 
plant. If you live in a similar area and use rain water or your VFT's stay 
outside. Avoid collecting water from at least the firs 3-4 downpours since this 
rain is usually very acidic and contains high amounts of solids. Bring your 
VFt's inside during this time. They will die if left outside.

Cool water <br>
written by DeviLe15, May 20, 2010 <br>
 
I bought a 4L distilled water and put it in the fridge. I want to know if it is 
ok to put it in the fridge for the plant. Since they don't like the cold, I 
don't think they would like it if you watered with cool water. Should I store 
the water out of the fridge?

 If 
you repotted your VFT in fertilized soil, it will burn the roots. I'm sure 
there is a section in this website that talks about it. Are yyou using proper 
water? I doubt boiling normal tap water works. I use distilled water. I have 
barely had my plant for a week. Maybe 4 days So I don't know by experience, but 
most from theory. Is it in a cold area? VFT are tropical, so they would 
naturally like a warm environment,<br>

 Janene. 
Venus flytraps come from the bogs of America, so are used to all sorts of 
weather! No, never use fertilised soil.<br>
<br>
Devile - Whats the point in 
wasting 4l of fridge space for something that does a plant no good?<br>
<br>

Just a thing to all the food question people - It isnt needed for a flytrap, 
aslong as you result to the sun, water and soil.<br>
<br>
I suggest for a wider 
range (And more expert advice) you go to the forum.<br>

 I have a tiny question about watering the fly traps. If

could use regular water? Or could I use bottled table water for her?

 okay 
everybody, distilled water costs A DOLLAR A GALLON, and rain water is FREE. how 
hard is it to buy one gallon, which will water your plant for well over a 
month, maybe even two? the time you spent on here asking about other types of 
water you could have spent getting the water recommended by every carnivorous 
plant website on the internet. everybody who asked about the different types of 
water are obviously unexperienced, so your plants are gonna die anyways.

I love VFT's <br>
written by Jtylerh, September 21, 2011 
<br>  I love my fly trap! Tips 4 all of you would be only use rain or distiller 
water no acceptions! They don't need bugs just make sure you give it lots of 
sun and always keep the soil damp not wet or dry. Have fun. Trim off the traps 
that die. Don't expect your first attempt at raising a fly trap to work out 
they are picky plants and it take a bit of time to get used to them! Dont start 
out with seeds. If you feed it never ever give it anything it could not catch 
itself in the swamp. And no they can't catch hamburger, don't be silly it will 
kill it! But most of all care for it like a child... No JK I'm not that freaky 
about plants. <br>

Winter Care <br>
written by Challenger, November 09, 2011
<br>  My plant is kept on the windowpane right above the radiator. Can I still 
keep it here during winter or should I take it outside to simulate the winter 
weather. I live in Munich so its pretty cold.<br>
<br>
Should I water it 
differently or continue with the same. I've had it for a decent 4 months and it 
seems to be doing really well up to now.<br>
<br>
Thanks
