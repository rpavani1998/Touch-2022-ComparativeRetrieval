<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
3 X's A DAY <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using a model of two 
washroom sinks, students measure how much water is used by brushing their teeth 
with the water left running and by brushing their teeth with the water used 
only sparingly. Students are encouraged to ask questions and provide new 
insights on how we can save water in our homes. 
<ol> 
<li>Reducing water use in little ways helps protect our water supply for the 
long term.</li> 
<li>All water is re-used and any water leaving your house has to be cleaned 
and treated so that you can use it again.</li> 
<li>Remember not to leave water running longer than necessary at any time (ex. 
don't leave the tap running while brushing your teeth).</li> </ol> <br>

ABORIGINAL VOICES<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students gather to find out the prominent 
role that water plays in native culture and practice now and in ages past. This 
activity is run by teacher/elders from Chippawa's of Nawash. 
<ol> 
<li>Water is sacred. </li> 
<li>All life needs water to survive. </li> 
<li>We need to respect and live in harmony with all of nature. </li> </ol> <br>
A-MAZE-ING WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students pretend to be drops of 
water entering a simulated water treatment plant. Find out what happens to 
municipally provided water before it enters the pipes to come into your home. 
Students will gain an understanding of how much has to be done to each drop of 
water that comes out of our taps and sprinklers and that we should conserve 
water as much as possible. Then tour an actual working Water Treatment Plant on 
site. 
<ol> 
<li>That humans use water faster than Mother Nature can purify it. </li> 
<li>That treating water involves three key processes in between the well and 
our taps.</li> 
<li>That reducing our water usage will not only preserve water resources, but 
also save us money and energy.</li> </ol> <br>
&quot;AQ&quot; THE AMAZING 
AQUIFER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students will be encouraged to investigate the 
source of groundwater, how it gets there and how it is extracted for our use. 
Find out how pollutants affect our groundwater and how pollution can be 
prevented. 
<ol> 
<li>Groundwater does not run in underground rivers; it percolates through sand 
and gravel.</li> 
<li>Groundwater is a source of drinking water through wells. </li> 
<li>Pollutants on the ground or in lakes will enter the groundwater and 
percolate through the system contaminating drinking water.</li> </ol> <br>

BACK YARD BUDDIES <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using a 
hands-on model of a residential area, students will discover how we can affect 
the groundwater and surface water in our environment through 
non-environmentally friendly practices in our own backyards. Students also 
learn the problems of contamination, how to prevent pollution problems in our 
own backyards and more environmentally friendly practices to help keep our 
water supplies safe from contamination. 
<ol> 
<li>What we do on the land affects the water as well. </li> 
<li>There are safe alternatives to pesticides. </li> 
<li>Everyone can take an active role in keeping our groundwater clean and safe.
</li> </ol> <br>
BOOTS, BUBBLES &amp; BUGS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students 
discover the differences between aquatic insects found in stream and pond 
habitats with emphasis on adaptations to their environment. Through the use of 
an interactive puppet show, participants follow Billy Water Boatman and a 
little girl named Polly as they wish for a better life underwater. Our 
characters meet a number of interesting creatures such as grasshoppers, 
damselfly nymphs, black fly larva, mayfly nymphs, water striders and whirligig 
beetles along their way learning that sometimes it is better not to get what 
you wish for! 
<ol> 
<li>Rivers, streams, lakes and ponds all possess a wide variety of plant and 
animal life.</li> 
<li>Animals have many adaptations that help them to survive aquatic life. </li>
<li>All animals and plants play an important role in the food chain and are 
deserving of our respect. We should keep their habitat clean to help them to 
survive.</li> </ol> <br>
BUCKET BRIGADE <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students work 
together to simulate medieval &amp; pioneer life, including firefighting 
methods. They also have the opportunity to talk to local firefighters and see 
modern firefighting technology such as fire trucks and fire hoses. Students 
line up and pass buckets full of water to put out a &quot;fire&quot;. 
<ol> 
<li>Water is important not only for health but also for safety (e.g. fire 
fighting).</li> 
<li>Historically, fire fighting required teamwork and an available water 
supply.</li> 
<li>Today, much of the water for fire fighting comes from the Municipal Water 
Supply.</li> </ol> <br>
CAN YOU MANAGE? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nutrient management 
is in the headlines all over Grey and Bruce Counties lately. Participants get a 
chance to learn what it is all about and how we can ensure safe water supplies 
for all our needs through hands-on activities using working models of 
agricultural areas. 
<ol> 
<li>A farm is like a factory in that raw materials go in, an end product is 
produced for market or consumption but there are waste products as well.</li> 
<li>Proper nutrient management will benefit not only the family but also the 
business, livestock and the environment.</li> 
<li>Everyone can take an active role in keeping our groundwater clean and safe.
</li> </ol> <br>

<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
DOWN AND OUT IN THE COUNTRY <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A 
sub-surface look at how sewage is treated in rural areas. Using a model of a 
septic system, students observe what happens to the solid and liquid waste and 
how it is cleaned as it travels through the soil material. Malfunctioning 
systems and their effects on the environment are also demonstrated. 
<ol> 
<li>All waste water has to be treated before it is returned to the environment.
</li> 
<li>A properly maintained septic system is good for the environment.</li> 
<li>We should never pour any toxic or hazardous materials down the drain or 
toilet.</li> </ol> <br>
DRIPIAL PURSUIT <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Teams of students 
can engage in a friendly game of not so &quot;trivial&quot; water facts. 
<ol> 
<li>These water facts are not so &quot;trivial&quot;. </li> 
<li>This is a game, winning isn't everything but we can all learn something 
from the game.</li> 
<li>There is a lot to learn about water. </li> </ol> <br>
DROP ZONE <br>
<br>

<br><br>
Students discover water towers not only store the water we need for 
our homes, schools and businesses but also provide the pressure necessary to 
get that water to us. Participants actively get involved in learning that the 
tower's size, shape and height will help determine what amount of pressure is 
available. Look out for the drop zone! 
<ol> 
<li>In many communities in Grey Bruce clean water is piped directly from the 
water tower into our homes, schools and businesses.</li> 
<li>It takes energy to pump the water up to the towers. </li> 
<li>Canadians waste a lot of water because it is so readily available. Imagine 
having to haul all of the water you use and perhaps you can begin to use less.
</li> </ol> <br>
EGGS TO ADULTS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students observe fish in 
two different stages of their life cycle. Through a brief discussion, they will 
learn about the different stages of a fish's life cycle and why habitat 
protection and clean water are important for each of these stages. Students 
will also learn how fish fit into the food web/chain and local ecosystem. 
Students will be encouraged to describe ways in which humans can both threaten 
and protect the natural habitat of fish. 
<ol> 
<li>Groundwater is important to trout because it keeps the water clean and 
cold.</li> 
<li>The Saugeen River is home to an assortment of fish and we should work at 
keeping it safe.</li> 
<li>It is important not to pollute groundwater because it can reach rivers and 
lakes where it can harm fish and other life.</li> </ol> <br>
ENVIROSCAPE 
HAZARDOUS WASTE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using a hands-on model of an industrial 
area, students will discover what hazardous substances are, where they come 
from and their effects on the environment. Students also learn the problems of 
hazardous waste contamination, how to clean up and prevent hazardous wastes 
from adversely affecting the environment. 
<ol> 
<li>Hazardous wastes are wastes that present a threat to human health or to 
the environment.</li> 
<li>Hazardous wastes can contaminate groundwater which is very difficult to 
clean up.</li> 
<li>Spill prevention and proper disposal are the keys to controlling hazardous 
wastes.</li> </ol> <br>

<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
EROSION BUSTERS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Participants 
build their own watershed using soil and materials supplied, then pour water 
over model to discover soil erosion problems. Participants are then given tools 
to help &quot;fix&quot; erosion problems. The importance of cover, wetlands and 
streambank protection is emphasized. 
<ol> 
<li>Exposed, bare soil can easily be washed away by water. </li> 
<li>Wetlands are a valuable part of any watershed, retaining water during high 
flows and augmenting supplies during low flow periods.</li> 
<li>Suspended materials in the water can harm aquatic animals and plants and 
create flooding problems downstream from erosion site.</li> </ol> <br>
GO WITH 
THE FLOW<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How can we save water in the kitchen? Students 
observe the effect of an aerator on our kitchen taps by washing dishes and 
comparing how much water was used both with and without an aerator. They also 
observe different methods that can be used to conserve water. 
<ol> 
<li>All of the water that we use in our homes must be cleaned and treated so 
that it can be used again.</li> 
<li>Reducing the amount of water that you use daily, saves money and helps 
reduce the amount of water that needs to be treated.</li> 
<li>Aerators mix air with the water coming out of a tap and help reduce the 
amount of water that is used while the tap is running.</li> </ol> <br>
GREAT 
WATER RACE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students continue their study of porosity and 
permeability by watching how quickly water passes through sand, gravel and 
fractured limestone. Students are introduced to the concepts of slope and angle 
and observe their effect on how water moves through the Earth. 
<ol> 
<li>The materials making up ground differ in permeability - that is, the 
ability of water to move through the pores (spaces) between different particles 
in the ground.</li> 
<li>If the materials are different, the permeability should be different and 
water should move through the ground at different speeds.</li> 
<li>Permeability is critical for water supply purposes; if water contained in 
soil or rock will not drain out, it is not available to water wells.</li> </ol> 
<br> H 2 OHHHHH ... THE SCIENCE OF WATER! <br>
<br>
<br>
Students discover the 
science of water &#150; buoyancy, density, surface tension and more! Hands-on 
experiments with water will have your budding scientists learning about the 
properties of water and putting the ohhhh! in H20! 
<ol> 
<li>All water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. </li> 
<li>Water is the only substance found naturally in all three states of matter: 
solid; liquid and gas.</li> 
<li>All living things depend on water. </li> </ol> <br>
HEALTHY 
STREAMS...HAPPY PEOPLE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students will review the food chain 
in a stream ecosystem. Using a &quot;gravity puzzle&quot;, students will learn 
that all the organisms in the stream are connected and that humans are part of 
the chain. Ultimately, humans can have both a positive and negative influence 
on streams, so if the streams stay healthy, so will humans. 
<ol> 
<li>Anglers (people who fish) are part of the food chain. </li> 
<li>Humans can do both good and bad things to these important habitats. </li> 
<li>The future of these special places depends on all of us. </li> </ol> <br>

LATHER UP <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How much water do we 
use for a 5 minute shower? What if we didn't have showers or even piped water? 
Students compare early medieval &amp; pioneer bathing methods to modern 
methods. How do we take water for granted now that we have it readily available 
in our homes? What would medieval/pioneer children think of our running water? 
What can we do to save water when having a shower? Students enter a model 
shower to see the difference when a simple technological water-saving device is 
employed. 
<ol> 
<li>A lot of water can be wasted while showering. </li> 
<li>Reduce water use by getting a low-flow shower head in your shower. </li> 
<li>Water use can also be reduced by turning off the water while soaping up. 
</li> </ol> <br>
MARSH MONSTERS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Participants use nets and 
equipment to discover what lives in the waters of the Saugeen River. A 
Biologist and volunteers assist in reviewing the food chain and interdependency.
<ol> 
<li>Rivers, streams, lakes and ponds all possess a wide variety of plant and 
animal life.</li> 
<li>Animals have many adaptations that help them to survive aquatic life. </li>
<li>All animals and plants play an important roll in the food chain and are 
deserving of our respect. We should keep their habitat clean to help them to 
survive.</li> </ol> <br>
OFF I GO <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Southern Ontario we 
have many nearby sources of water. In many countries people must travel far 
distances to obtain clean water. Students participate in a relay obstacle 
course to simulate the act of carrying water over difficult terrain and long 
distances. Likewise, water travels long distances through pipes to get to our 
homes. They will be encouraged to imagine what it would be like if we did not 
have water piped into our homes? 
<ol> 
<li>In Canada we have a steady supply of water and we therefore tend to waste 
a lot.</li> 
<li>In many countries people have to go long distances to find water and they 
therefore conserve much more.</li> 
<li>Think about children in other countries on their water fetching journeys 
and try to conserve water whenever possible.</li> </ol> <br>
OIL SLICK! <br>

<br> <br>
<br>
What happens when oil is spilled in a natural habitat? Students 
have a brief discussion of this phenomenon in the context of a large scale (as 
in oil tanker spill at sea) and on a smaller scale (such as when oil travels 
through storm drains into our local lakes and rivers). Students use a model to 
see how real oil and water mix (or don't) and how the animal's habitats, 
including vegetation, are adversely affected. An actual technique of cleaning 
up the oil is demonstrated. Students also take the role of wildlife biologists 
observing feathers when they are wet, dry or soaked in oil; giving oral 
descriptions of their observations. Then they attempt to actually clean the 
feathers. Students are encouraged to think about actions such as pouring used 
oil and other contaminants down storm drains or household drains and how these 
cause pollution and discuss why prevention is a better strategy than 
remediation. 
<ol> 
<li>The majority of oil in the environment doesn't come from tanker spills at 
sea but from people on land who throw used oil into the garbage, down the drain 
or into the storm sewers.</li> 
<li>A habitat is the natural environment where a plant or animal lives and 
grows; its home. If the habitat is polluted with oil, the plants and animals in 
that habitat are very seriously damaged and may even die.</li> 
<li>Oil cleanup is very expensive and difficult and it is impossible to clean 
up everything completely; it is easier to prevent oil pollution than it is to 
clean up after it.</li> </ol> <br>

<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
PIONEER WATER RACE <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How did 
pioneers collect all of the water that they needed for their daily lives? 
Students participate in a race using buckets of water and pose questions and 
make observations to gain an understanding of the difference between Canadian 
communities in the early 1800s and modern life in their community. How did 
people function differently without our technology? 
<ol> 
<li>A fresh, clean water supply is necessary for survival so it is very 
important that we conserve it for future generations.</li> 
<li>In Canada, we are very lucky to have clean water piped directly into our 
homes. In pioneer times, and even today in some countries, water had to be 
carried in buckets from the source and, in some cases, was not even clean.</li> 
<li>Canadians waste a lot of water because it is so readily available. Imagine 
having to haul all of the water you use and perhaps you can begin to use less.
</li> </ol> <br>
POROSITY &amp; PERMEABILITY <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Porosity and 
permeability are the key factors in determining how water moves through or is 
held by the earth's surface materials. Using models to determine grain size and 
real soil samples for testing, discover one of the mysteries of how the water 
cycle serves us. Students engage in an activity which demonstrates these 
principles. 
<ol> 
<li>Porosity and Permeability are the key factors in determining how water 
moves through or is held by the earth's surface materials.</li> 
<li>Porosity refers to the pore spaces between soil particles or pieces - if 
there are many spaces then the soil has high porosity.</li> 
<li>Permeability refers to and the ease with which water passes through the 
pores - the more and bigger the spaces the more easily water will pass through.
</li> </ol> <br>
ROLLING THROUGH THE SHED <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students pretend 
to be drops of rain which, through precipitation, enter into the watershed. 
They roll through the watershed to see how water can be contaminated. 
<ol> 
<li>As water travels through the watershed it picks up many pollutants from 
the air, roads, lawns, farms, rivers etc.</li> 
<li>Even things that are not directly placed in the water can still be picked 
up by it and contaminate it.</li> 
<li>It is important to protect our water supply by reducing all pollution. 
</li> </ol> <br>

ROYAL FLUSH <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How does a toilet 
work? Students examine how the mechanism in an ordinary household device works 
and the difference between water-saver toilets and regular-flow toilets. 
<ol> 
<li>Flushing a toilet can waste a lot of water. </li> 
<li>By using a low flow toilet or a toilet dam, a lot of water can be saved. 
</li> 
<li>Only flush the toilet when it is necessary and never flush garbage down 
the toilet.</li> </ol> <br>
RUNOFF OR RECHARGE? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using a 
model, students investigate the importance of vegetation in helping to fight 
against water erosion. Students compare how concrete, gravel, bare earth, and 
vegetation surfaces affect runoff and infiltration. 
<ol> 
<li>Recharge occurs when water from precipitation seeps into vegetated soil 
putting water back into the ground - groundwater!</li> 
<li>Runoff occurs when the water from precipitation cannot sink into the soil 
and runs along a road or dirt path picking up contaminants as it goes and 
causes erosion.</li> 
<li>Vegetation (plants) help fight erosion and help recharge groundwater. </li>
</ol> <br>
SAVE OUR WETLANDS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students will investigate the 
importance of wetlands in storing water as part of the hydrologic cycle. By 
using a student built model, originally designed as a Science Fair project, 
students will see the results of failing to conserve or manage wetland areas. 
Wetlands help to retain extra water during high flow periods (snowmelt and 
significant rainstorm water) and augment river flow throughout the year. Even 
the reduction in size of an average wetland can greatly affect the river and 
the people who live downstream as witnessed by students when the wetland is 
&quot;dredged&quot; and a &quot;rainstorm&quot; comes along. 
<ol> 
<li>Humans can affect the natural world both negatively and positively. </li> 
<li>Wetlands work like giant sponges to help regulate the amount of water in a 
river system - holding water back during snow melt and storms and slowly 
releasing it during low flow periods.</li> 
<li>Wetlands play an important role in our environment both from a 
hydrological standpoint and also the wide variety of animals and plants that 
depend on this habitat to survive.</li> </ol> <br>
SEPTIC SIGHTS <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Students observe the water trickle through sewage pipes into the septic 
bed in a full size model of a septic system. Where does the waste water and 
solid waste go? 
<ol> 
<li>A septic system is a system for treating waste water by filtering it 
through certain types of gravel and earth materials in order to clean it.</li> 
<li>Rural homes or cottages are often serviced by a septic system rather than 
a municipal wastewater system like we have in the city.</li> 
<li>A malfunctioning or overloaded septic system can contaminate groundwater 
and make the people, who use the groundwater from a well for drinking and 
washing, very sick.</li> </ol> <br>

SIMPLY DIVINE <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Meet our 
&quot;Dowser&quot;, also known as a &quot;Water Witch&quot;. What would 18th 
and 19th century settlers do if they were not living near a river or lake? How 
would they be able to find water below the surface of the ground? Students will 
see if they can successfully dowse for water. How do we find today? 
<ol> 
<li>Water is necessary for survival therefore locating water is crucial for 
health and prosperity.</li> 
<li>Water diviners are people who locate water using a forked stick or 
&quot;divining rod.&quot;</li> 
<li>Water diviners have been known to be successful when other methods do not 
work for finding water however it is unknown how/why the practice really works.
</li> </ol> <br>
SOMETHING FISHY'S GOIN' ON <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students test 
the pH levels of various common liquids (ex: juice, vinegar). There is a brief 
discussion of pH and how natural habitats must have water of a certain pH in 
order to support plant and animal life. Students use model lakes to see which 
lakes are healthy and which are too acidic, due to acid precipitation. 
<ol> 
<li>The pH scale is used to measure how acidic or basic a substance is. </li> 
<li>Acids that we can eat or drink may not be healthy for aquatic life to live 
in.</li> 
<li>We must protect the water quality of surface and groundwater by preventing 
water and air pollution.</li> </ol> <br>
TREATING TRASH <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How 
does a modern landfill operate? Students explore for themselves how we treat 
our trash today and compare this to the unsafe practices that were done in the 
past. A landfill model provides a breakdown of the different stages of the 
treatment process and demonstrates the effect on the groundwater if our trash 
is not disposed of properly. 
<ol> 
<li>Today's modern landfills are for the most part safe but there are 
exceptions.</li> 
<li>We should avoid putting garbage into a landfill in the first place by 
following the 3 R's.</li> 
<li>Garbage that is not properly treated can pollute both surface and 
groundwater.</li> </ol> <br>
WATER CYCLE MADNESS <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students 
learn about the water cycle first hand by watching it cycle before their eyes. 
Unique working model shows the processes of evaporation, transpiration, 
condensation, precipitation, and runoff all with the help of a miniature sun 
(lamp) and other materials. Learn how the water cycle impacts our daily lives. 
<ol> 
<li>Water is never lost or gained; there is always the same amount of water in 
the world. The water we drink today was used by dinosaurs a million years ago!
</li> 
<li>The water cycle is a model that shows how water is continuously recycled 
through the environment.</li> 
<li>We waste water by making it permanently contaminated so that it can no 
longer be used for drinking or washing.</li> </ol> <br>
back to top <br>

<p>ACTIVITY</p> 
<p>DESCRIPTION</p> 
<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
WATER-GO-ROUND <br>
<br>
<br>
Students are led 
through a variety of experiments using an enviroscape model to demonstrate how 
water is used and recycled in our communities. Demonstrations and discussion 
include water treatment, distribution, wastewater collection, wastewater 
treatment and biosolids disposal/use. This activity ties in well with a number 
of other activities at the festival. 
<ol> 
<li>All water from a water treatment plant is treated so it is safe for 
drinking purposes.</li> 
<li>The same water is here now as was when dinosaurs roamed the earth. </li> 
<li>Everything we do on the land affects the water we depend on. </li> </ol> 
<br> WATER HOGS MAKE SMOG <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This hands-on activity shows 
students the connections in how using water can create air pollution. Students 
learn through pumping water from a &quot;lake&quot; model, the process of 
getting water to your house. Each step of the process from cleaning, heating, 
and treating waste water creates air pollution. Acid rain created from air 
pollution makes water an unsuitable habitat for animals and plants to survive. 
<ol> 
<li>Municipal water treatment is an energy intensive process. </li> 
<li>Most energy consumption (fossil fuels) results in release of pollutants 
into the atmosphere.</li> 
<li>Pollutants released through burning of fossil fuels cause acid rain. </li> 
</ol> <br>
WATER MAIN BREAK! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students will have the 
opportunity to see how groundwater is pumped from the aquifer to a reservoir, 
treated (chlorinated) and piped through a distribution system to be delivered 
to homes and businesses in the community. This will emulate the systems 
currently in use in many communities that have municipal water systems in place.
<ol> 
<li>Drinking water comes from two locations &#150; 1) lakes and rivers and 2) 
groundwater aquifers.</li> 
<li>Watermain distribution systems are mainly located in built up areas such 
as villages, towns and cities and are used to transport water from a water 
towers/reservoirs to the houses, businesses and industries that are connected 
to it.</li> 
<li>The water in the watermains/pipes is under pressure and when a watermain 
break occurs, people using the water from that pipe notice that there is lower 
pressure in the water coming from their taps.</li> </ol> <br>
WATER MAKES IT 
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
Students participate in a game similar to something on the 
&quot;Price is Right&quot; to determine how much water is used to produce 
different items. We all know all living things need water to survive, but also 
to manufacture many things, water is required. 
<ol> 
<li>Large amounts of water are used to manufacture all goods as well as food 
and energy.</li> 
<li>All of the water used to manufacture goods or make energy is called

WATER VITAL TO HEALTH <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How is 
water used in our body? Students will engage in an interactive activity to 
discover the necessity of water to our body's organs and life systems. 
<ol> 
<li>All things need water to survive. </li> 
<li>Two-thirds of our bodies are made up of water. Variance in age and sex 
affects the total body water.</li> 
<li>We all need clean, safe water for healthy bodies. </li> </ol> <br>
WELL 
DRILL IT<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students discover the importance of the water table 
as it exists underground, investigating how we access the water from aquifers. 
How do we get the water out of the ground once we've located an aquifer? 
Students &quot;drill&quot; their own wells, pump out water in models as well as 
use a hand pump to discover the work involved in getting water from 
underground. A model of a modern drilled well helps students to visualize the 
layers of different materials underfoot. 
<ol> 
<li>Not all water is easy to get to; there are many different layers beneath 
the earth's surface.</li> 
<li>The water table is the level of groundwater beneath the earth. </li> 
<li>An aquifer is a layer of porous material underground that is saturated 
with water.</li> </ol> <br>
WELL SEALED <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wells sometimes dry 
up or are just not used any longer, but when you leave them unprotected our 
groundwater is at risk! 
<ol> 
<li>Water from wells can become contaminated if the soil and groundwater 
around the well becomes contaminated and then a new well must be dug.</li> 
<li>Groundwater can become contaminated through open wells that are no longer 
in use.</li> 
<li>An old well can be sealed with clay, because it is impermeable, to prevent 
contamination of the groundwater.</li> </ol> <br>

<p>ACTIVITY</p> 
<p>DESCRIPTION</p> 
<p>KEY MESSAGES</p> <br>
WE USE THAT MUCH? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students use an 
interactive activity to discover how much water is used in every day activities 
in relation to a known reference (2L pop bottles). Water conservation from 
various sources can also be examined. 
<ol> 
<li>Water is an important part of many activities in the home and some 
activities use more water than others.</li> 
<li>ALL water is treated to the same standards regardless of its eventual use 
in the home.</li> 
<li>Conserve water by using less water where possible in the home so that less 
of it needs to be treated unnecessarily.</li> </ol> <br>
WHAT IS A WATERSHED? 
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
Using a large 3D model complete with water, streams and 
tributaries, students investigate what makes up the major watersheds in our 
area. Students will learn about the main features of a river system (e.g. 
mouth, source, wetlands, tributary, river, stream, delta, etc.). Erosion and 
deposition will also be explored. Students will also be encouraged to locate 
their school's community on watershed maps. 
<ol> 
<li>Water flows downhill, using the path of least resistance. </li> 
<li>A watershed is a drainage basin where all of the surface water flows in 
one direction.</li> 
<li>What we do upstream will affect those downstream. </li> </ol> <br>
WHAT'S 
UP DOC?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A person from medieval times sits wrapped in 
bandages waiting for some sort of miracle. Students work together to try to 
determine what waterbourne disease the actor has by asking the person what 
symptoms they have (similar to the type of questions your own doctor may ask) 
to determine what might be the problem. Possible ways to avoid the sickness 
again are discussed as well. 
<ol> 
<li>What are waterborne diseases and how are they spread. </li> 
<li>Explain how the health of humans is affected by environmental factors 
(e.g. water pollution from sewage or other human contaminants and how these 
diseases affect our health).</li> 
<li>How waterborne diseases can be prevented. </li> </ol> <br>
WHERE IT 
GOES... WHEN I GO<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students discover for themselves the 
process that sewage and wastewater takes in a wastewater treatment plant before 
it is safely returned to our waterways. This hands-on activity takes them 
through the processes without leaving the premises. Photos of actual local 
treatment plants are included for relating to the working model. 
<ol> 
<li>Never pour things down the drain that are unsafe for the environment. </li>
<li>Waste water needs to be treated before it can be returned to our waterways.
</li> 
<li>Some types of bacteria can be used to do work for us. </li> </ol> <br>

YOU'RE MOSTLY WATER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Students will discover how much of their 
body mass is made up of water. Using a teeter-totter, and water bottles, they 
will be able to calculate the amount of water in their bodies. 
<ol> 
<li>The human body is 70% water. </li> 
<li>We lose water each day through breathing, perspiring and urinating. </li> 
<li>We take water into our bodies through the foods we eat and the beverages 
we drink.</li> </ol> <br>
