<h1> Minneapolis Star-Tribune - Bottled water or tap water? Debate still rages 
on which is better</h1> 
<p>May 2, 2011</p> 
<p><em>By Kevin Spear</em></p> 
<p>The next time you go to the vending machine for a bottle of water (costing 
6 cents an ounce) or, instead, sip from the drinking fountain (free), you will 
be taking part in another debate that touches on the fate of humankind.</p> 
<p>Because the next time you grab a bottle from a case in the fridge (costing 
a penny an ounce) or fill a glass from the tap (a penny for 5 gallons) you will 
be choosing between dollars and cents, essential hydration and environmental 
waste, and personal health and public health.</p> 
<p>Let your wallet be your first guide, opponents of bottled water say.</p> 
<p>&quot;The bottled-water industry has really built a market on casting doubt 
on the quality of tap water,&quot; said Kristin Urquiza, director of Think 
Outside the Bottle, a campaign devised by Corporate Accountability 
International, a Boston-based group. &quot;But more and more people are saying, 
'Wait a minute, bottled water is costing thousands of times more than tap 
water.' &quot;</p> 
<p>Convenience has its virtues, industry supporters say.</p> 
<p>&quot;Sometimes it's a moment-by-moment choice, where you are in front of 
the 7-Eleven cooler and you grab a bottle of water because that's all you 
really want instead of a carbonated beverage,&quot; said Tom Luria, spokesman 
for the International Bottled Water Association. &quot;That should be applauded 
by everyone, just because of obesity and heart disease and other problems that 
come with excessive calories.&quot;</p> 
<p>As sales of bottled water took off during the past decade, so did a 
backlash from environmental and consumer groups that encourage use of reusable 
bottles.</p> 
<p>When sales dropped in 2008 and 2009, the industry blamed the recession, 
while opponents claimed progress in turning the public against bottled water.
</p> 
<p>Today, sales are back on track, according to Luria. But not entirely, said 
Urquiza, pointing to a continued lag last year in revenue for Nestl&eacute; 
Waters North America Inc., the largest U.S. bottler of water and the owner of 
several brands, including Florida-based Zephyrhills.</p> 
<p>Figures published by the Beverage Marketing Corp., a private research 
company, show that the industry rebounded last year to sell 8.8 billion 
gallons, or nearly as much as it sold in 2007, the peak year for sales.</p> 
<p>That's not the sole result of any economic recovery; the personal-sized, 
disposable bottle of water also got significantly cheaper.</p> 
<p>&quot;In the single-serve market &mdash; the 1.5-liter-size containers and 
smaller &mdash; that segment had very aggressive pricing in 2010, and that's 
one of the factors that helped drive the growth,&quot; said Gary Hemphill, 
Beverage Marketing's managing director.</p> 
<p>According to his research on gallons sold, sports-and-energy drinks and 
ready-to-drink tea and coffee had the greatest gains last year, followed by 
bottled water, which had an overall growth of 3.5 percent. Soda, still the 
leading beverage product, continued a multiyear decline.</p> 
<p>&quot;The general movement of the consumer is toward healthier 
refreshments,&quot; Hemphill said. &quot;In that spectrum, we think bottled 
water is positioned well for growth.&quot;</p> 
<p>Industry supporters and detractors spar regularly over the effects, good 
and bad, of bottling water.</p> 
<p>Industry supporters note that bottlers have switched to containers made 
with a third less plastic, reducing them from 18.9 grams &mdash; or the weight 
of about four nickels &mdash; to 12.7 grams.</p> 
<p>Industry detractors say the rate of recycling bottles, according to 
government figures, is a dismal 25 percent. Even Zephyrhills packaging notes 
&quot;fewer than 25% of all plastic bottles actually are recycled. We need your 
help.&quot;</p> 
<p>And the quest by bottled-water companies to tap new sources continues to 
stir controversy.</p> 
<p>After a bitter fight, Niagara Bottling Co. got permission two years ago to 
pump as much as 484,000 gallons a day from the Floridan Aquifer near Groveland. 
Today, Panhandle residents are fighting to prevent Nestl&eacute; from taking 
nearly 500,000 gallons a day from the spring-fed Wacissa River.</p> 
<p>In many respects, the choice of whether to drink bottled water touches on 
the kinds of trade-offs Americans routinely face in their everyday lives.</p> 
<p>A car with a big engine may be fun to drive but costs more at the pump and 
contributes to a dependency on foreign oil. Setting the air conditioner at 70 
degrees may feel comfortable but results in higher utility bills and in power 
plants discharging more greenhouse gas.</p> 
<p>According to Nestl&eacute; spokeswoman Jane Lazgin, opting for bottled 
water is not about saying no to tap water; it's about saying yes to a healthier 
alternative to soft drinks.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think society has just become more conscious and mindful of 
calories in their diet and calories in their beverages,&quot; Lazgin said. 
&quot;People are just getting back to water.&quot;</p> 
<p>Luria, of the International Bottled Water Association, said tap water is 
&quot;essential to modern living.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't want to knock tap water,&quot; Luria said. &quot;Sometimes 
bottled water is preferable. It tastes better, it looks better, it's 
cost-effective if purchased at a big-box store.&quot;</p> 
<p>But Emily Wurth, director of Food &amp; Water Watch's water program, said 
bottled-water marketing implies that tap water is unpleasant and unsafe when, 
by contrast, not all bottled water is as clean and well-regulated as tap water.
</p> 
<p>&quot;People who probably can't afford bottled water chose it anyway 
because the marketing has made them fear for the safety of their tap 
water,&quot; Wurth said.</p> 
<p>Her worry is that, as confidence in public-water supplies erodes, support 
and maintenance for public-water supplies are likely to diminish, setting the 
stage for takeovers by private enterprise.</p> 
<p>&quot;We would be reverting to what a developing country is like, where 
those who are affluent enough can purchase safe water,&quot; Wurth said.</p> 
<p>Orlando Utilities Commission, the region's largest water utility, doesn't 
foresee losing customers' confidence because of bottled-water marketing. The 
utility has 32 wells that each extend 1,400 feet into the Floridan Aquifer. 
They are among the deepest and best-protected wells in Florida &mdash; and they 
tap the same water source that Niagara Bottling draws from.</p> 
<p>OUC's primary water treatment uses ozone, a form of oxygen that zaps 
impurities. A trace of chlorine is added, as required by regulations, to ensure 
that the water remains sanitary in pipelines.</p> 
<p>Rob Teegarden, an OUC vice president, said bottled water serves a purpose, 
including convenience.</p> 
<p>&quot;If you are willing to pay 3,000 to 8,000 times more for it [than for 
tap water], more power to you,&quot; Teegarden said.</p> 
<p>He said a bigger challenge for public-water suppliers is avoiding a major 
contamination incident.</p> 
<p>&quot;If that happens, all bets are off,&quot; Teegarden said. &quot;But 
the same could happen with bottled water.&quot;</p>
