<h3>Fixing Leaky Pipes Could Triple U.S. Water Bills</h3> Wednesday, March 
7th, 2012 
<p>In many U.S. communities the system of water and sewer pipes, mains and 
treatment plants that deliver drinking water and sanitation are aging and in 
need of repair. Aging infrastructure places the community&rsquo;s drinking 
water at risk of contamination and we see this on a weekly basis around the US 
with reported bacteria outbreaks and boiling requirements.&nbsp;This is not an 
problem that can be ignored.&nbsp; The American Water Works Associationestimates
 that keeping up with drinking water infrastructure needs alone, repairing and 
replacing old pipes and laying new ones for a growing population, will cost 
$1.7 trillion dollars over the next 25 years.</p> 
<h2>Tap Water Pipe Repairs Will Cost Households Up To $550 More Per Year</h2> 
<p>Because water delivery is funded primarily from utility bills, AWWA 
estimates the increased cost for repair and expansion of drinking water systems 
at $100 - $550 or more per household. Estimates vary dramatically at the local 
level, depending on the age of the community&rsquo;s pipes and the size of the 
system:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In the most affected small communities, the study suggests that a 
typical three-person household could see its drinking water bill increase by as 
much as $550 per year above current levels . . . In the largest water systems, 
costs can be spread over a large population base. Needed investments would be 
consistent with annual per household cost increases ranging from roughly $75 to 
more than $100 per year by the mid-2030s . . .&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Needed repairs are &ldquo;going to challenge many communities, particularly 
those where they&rsquo;ve been experiencing economic problems, and also in some 
places where the population has declined. You have a smaller customer base that 
has to pay a bigger bill, and that&rsquo;s never a welcome circumstance,&rdquo; 
Aurel Arndt, general manager of the Lehigh County Authority and advisory 
council member,explained to the Huffington Post.</p> 
<h2>Population Growth and Crumbling Sewers Drive Water Bills Up More</h2> 
<p>In the Northeast and Midwest, repair of existing systems will be the 
primary cost increase driver. But in the West and South, where communities have 
newer systems but growing populations, laying pipes to new development will be 
a much bigger component of water bill increases.</p> 
<p>Regional Water Infrastructure Costs</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The needs uncovered in &lsquo;Buried No Longer&rsquo; are large, but 
they are not insurmountable,&rdquo; said AWWA Executive Director David 
LaFrance. &ldquo;When you consider everything that tap water delivers &mdash; 
public health protection, fire protection, support for the economy, the quality 
of life we enjoy &ndash; we owe it to future generations to confront the 
infrastructure challenge today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The American Water Works Association is a membership organization of the 
nation&rsquo;s public utility companies and is advocating increased federal 
funding for water infrastructure.</p>

<h3>19% of US Drinking Wells Contaminated According To USGS Study</h3> 
Thursday, October 13th, 2011 
<p>For the first time a national study has been conducted testing for 
potential trace contaminants in wells and aquifers. Conducted by the United 
States Geological Survey, it was found that overall 19 percent of the 5,183 
tested untreated public, private and monitoring wells exceeded health-based 
safety standards. When private drinking water wells were removed from the data 
set, it was found that a surprising&nbsp;13 percent of all private wells 
exceeded the health standards or guidelines. As a&nbsp;result, the report
recommends&nbsp;homeowners consider purchasing ahome water filter to purify 
their drinking water to protect themselves from these trace 
contaminants.&nbsp;According&nbsp;to the study, the estimate of those 
potentially at risk are 6.5 Million households, or approximately 26 Million 
people!</p> 
<p>A total of 20 trace elements were monitored in the study. The three that 
were shown to have the highest levels wereArsenic, Radon, and Manganese. These 
were not isolated to a couple regions, but rather found to be persistent 
nationwide stating, &ldquo;Wells with human health benchmark exceedances were 
widespread across the United States; they occurred in all aquifer groups and in 
both humid and dry regions.&rdquo; &nbsp;A copy of the study can be foundhere.
</p> 
<p>The wells that were found to be most at risk were the private wells used by 
homeowners. This is due to the fact that these wells are not monitored by any 
agency and are not regulated. It is the homeowners responsibility to keep tabs 
on the water quality and for many reasons this is not commonly done. As a 
result, an increased amount of contaminants and health effecting trace minerals 
have seeped into these wells unnoticed.</p> 
<h2>Arsenic Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Arsenic:</p> 
<p>Arsenic Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>According to the EPA website on the dangers of arsenic, &nbsp;&rdquo;
Non-cancer effects can include thickening and discoloration of the skin, 
stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; diarrhea; numbness in hands and feet; partial 
paralysis; and blindness. Arsenic has been linked to cancer of the bladder, 
lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver, and prostate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Joseph Ayotte, one of the researchers and a hydrologist with the U.S.G.S. 
states&nbsp;&rdquo;It was a bit surprising how many of these trace elements had 
exceedances of human health benchmarks, especially compared to other 
contaminants we are often concerned about. The findings certainly underscore 
the message we hear from the public health agencies, that everyone should test 
their wells for a suite of trace elements.&rdquo;<em>For interested customers, 
the Berkey PF-2 filters are used inside the lower chamber of our home water 
filter system for removing arsenic from the water.</em></p> 
<h2>Radon Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Radon:</p> 
<p>Radon Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>According to the EPA website on Radon; &ldquo;Radon in water is only a 
concern if your drinking water comes from underground, such as a well that 
pumps water from an aquifer.Breathing radon in indoor air can cause lung 
cancer. Radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in 
your lungs when you breathe it.. ..radon in indoor air is the second leading 
cause of lung cancer.&rdquo; This statement directly&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;to 
the radon dangers this study has found.</p> 
<p>Joseph Ayotte makes another statement many should pay heed to. He states, 
&ldquo;We often get more upset about these anthropogenic contaminants but we 
have to remember that these naturally occurring elements are often times more 
of a widespread problem. Not to diminish the importance of the others, but 
trace elements are also hugely important and arguably more so.&rdquo; 
&nbsp;This is in large portion due to the fact that these trace elements build 
up in the body over time and can cause a slow degradation of health. This can 
be more dangerous as an individual can experience a slow growing health issue 
over many years. That individual and their doctor may struggle to isolate the 
root cause and not recognize that it could be&nbsp;harmful&nbsp;trace elements 
from their own well water. With this many Americans potentially at risk, we 
also&nbsp;strongly advocate that home owners take the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;steps 
to test their wells on a yearly basis. We also&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;a home water 
filter like the berkey to remove these harmful trace elements from the water.
</p> 
<p>One additional&nbsp;poignant&nbsp;USGS statement was that harmful elements 
&ldquo;far outpace&rdquo; other pollutants, many of which get far more public 
attention. Based on previous USGS research, this 19 percent of wells that were 
discovered in this study compare with 7 percent of wells contaminated with 
nitrates and 1 to 2 percent for pesticides and volatile organic compounds.</p> 
<h2>Manganese Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Manganese:</p> 
<p>Manganese Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>The EPA does not have primary health risks&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with 
Manganese, rather they set secondary standards due to impacts 
&ldquo;such&nbsp;as the corrosion of iron and copper, may stain household 
fixtures, and impart objectionable metallic taste and red or blue-green color 
to the water supply as well. Corrosion of distribution system pipes can reduce 
water flow.&rdquo; &nbsp;Manganese can have a &ldquo;black to brown color; 
black staining; bitter metallic taste&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Protection With a Home Water Filter</h2> 
<p>The primary question we have to ask ourselves is:&nbsp;<strong>How have 
these concentrations gotten so high putting so many US citizens at risk, and 
how does one protect their family?</strong>There are two primary causes for 
these major well changes; natural&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;evolution / groundwater 
age, and pollution.</p> 
<p>The&nbsp;geochemistry&nbsp;of groundwater changes in time due to the 
contact with it&rsquo;s aquifer materials. This constant change and reactions 
with minerals is considered&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;evolution. Basically, the longer 
the water has been in contact with the aquifer, the 
more&nbsp;chemically&nbsp;evolved it is deemed to be and thus the greater 
concentrations of these trace minerals, some of which are harmful to the body 
such as arsenic and radon. Not stressed enough in this report is the fact that 
the study analysis is based on NAWQA (National Water-Quality Assessment) 
Program data collected from 1992 to 2003.&nbsp;Given the statements in the 
report and prior historical data, our feeling is that these harmful levels have 
most likely inclined, not declined since this data was collected.</p> 
<p>In addition, while not discussed nor a focus of the USGS study, a major and 
still growing problem is pollution.&nbsp;As our lands continue to be treated 
with fertilizers and chemicals, in concert with&nbsp;continued&nbsp;land 
development, population growth, and industry pollution we experience an ever 
increasing trickling of&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;waste into our groundwater systems 
and waterways. Many of these chemicals seep and soak through the sediment 
impacting our wells directly. However, they also contaminate the wells 
indirectly by surface water runoff flowing into the underground waterway 
systems and&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;finding&nbsp;their&nbsp;resting spots in 
karsts and water aquifers that these wells feed off of.&nbsp;The reality is 
that has been a growing problem&nbsp;for decades now.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve stressed 
the importance of&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;of karsts before as most folks do not 
realize that once these groundwater supplies are contaminated naturally or by 
human pollution, it is very difficult and expensive to reverse the condition. 
Regardless, protection with a home water filter is essential for homeowners 
whose wells have been&nbsp;compromised&nbsp;by these harmful trace minerals 
or&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;pollutants.</p>

<h3>Chesapeake Energy Company Fined in Drinking Water Contamination</h3> 
Wednesday, May 25th, 2011 
<p>In a very notable decision, the Department of Environmental Protection of 
Pennsylvania has fined the Chesapeake Energy Corp. 1.1 million for 
contaminating the water supplies of local residents.&nbsp;The state agency said 
that throughout 2010 it investigated complaints of methane contamination in the 
drinking water of several residential water wells in northeastern PA. Some of 
this methane contamination, also&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to virally on the web as 
&ldquo;tap water catching on fire&rdquo;, could be seen in theHBO documentary 
Gasland, and reaffirms many of the concerns brought about by the 
film.&nbsp;Upon DEP conclusion it was determined that the drinking 
water&nbsp;contamination had been&nbsp;caused by natural gas drilling and that 
&ldquo;improper well casing and cementing in shallow zones&rdquo; allowed gas 
from deep basins to seep into drinking water aquifers.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The water well contamination fine is the largest single penalty DEP 
has ever assessed against an oil and gas operator, and the Avella tank fire 
penalty is the highest we could assess under the Oil and Gas Act,&rdquo; said 
Mike Krancer, who heads the state agency. &ldquo;Our message to drillers and to 
the public is clear.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is a step in the right direction and it seems that the public&rsquo;s 
outcry for caution due to&nbsp;water contamination from fracking is being 
heeded by state officials and more importantly the organization that is 
designed to protect our environment from careless resource removal.</p> 
<p>Chesapeake has stated that they are accepting the fine and are making a 
concerted effort towards improving the raised issues. This is left to be seen, 
but they are officially on notice,&hellip; as are the other companies that are 
engaged in the practice of fracking as quickly as possible in this 
gas-land-grab.</p> 
<p>The gas industry&rsquo;s wobbly position was brought to the forefront of 
discussion recently when in April a well blow-out during Chesapeake&rsquo;s 
well completion operations in Pennsylvania, saw several thousand gallons of 
drilling fluid escape into local waterways. These sorts of 
&ldquo;mishaps&rdquo; not only threaten to contaminate our own drinking water, 
but also destroy existence of any animal, fish, and plant life in the affected 
and surrounding regions.</p> 
<p>The Pennsylvania DEP&rsquo;s decision helps confirm a trend in which 
individual US states are taking a less lenient stance towards shale gas 
drilling and its potential health and environmental effects. We&rsquo;ve seen 
this in NY as the battle between environmentalists/homeowners and natural gas 
companies continues to heat up with drilling bans in place. However, concerns 
over water supply contamination seem to be based on variables other than some 
would agree with. Currently, there seems to be a thought that contamination is 
a result of inadequate well casing and cementing. In reality it is the chemical 
substances used for the fracking that&nbsp;cause&nbsp;the drinking water 
contamination. This fracking soup of&nbsp;chemicals&nbsp;are known to be very 
toxic and environmentalists are concerned that the eye may be taken off the 
ball if the focus is simply on the casing/cementing. Obviously better 
insulation of these chemicals from the environment is a move in the right 
direction, but both issues need to be addressed fully.</p>

<h3>Where Has All The Water Gone?</h3> Sunday, February 27th, 2011 
<p>Around the world, freshwater sources are shrinking as lake, river and 
aquifer levels are falling faster than can be replenished. In addition, the 
usefulness of water contained in these natural reservoirs is being compromised 
by pollution from industrial and household chemicals. It is estimated that 
worldwide water consumption doubles every 20 years, with predictions that 
demand will surpass supply within 30 years. That may be too optimistic. With 
all of these conditions persisting, it&rsquo;s no wonder that public concerned 
interest in our water resources and drinking water quality is exponentially 
rising.</p> 
<h2>Impact of Water Runoff</h2> 
<p>One explanation for falling water table levels is offered by Richard 
McGrath, director of codes and standards, Cement Association of Canada: 
&ldquo;The increased use of hardscaping (impervious pavements) in our major 
urban areas allows the direct run-off of oil and other contaminants into the 
storm water system, preventing the recharging of groundwater levels and natural 
purification of the run-off water.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Storm water runoff that would normally seep through the porous ground must 
often find its own path across toxic paved areas. The resulting environmental 
waste water is re-routed to man-made runoff areas. Household &lsquo;grey 
water&rsquo;, the water waste from sinks and washing is increasingly 
contaminated with household chemicals. Now, this more toxic soup of water 
runoff either saturates the surrounding land or gets routed through community 
sewer systems to water treatment plants where industrial filtration attempts to 
make it drinkable. More can learned about this phenomenon in our article 
reviewing the importance ofKarst conservation.</p> 
<h2>Disturbance of Natural Waterways</h2> 
<p>Another contributor to the depletion and contamination of our water sources 
is the fact that housing development is no longer limited to geographical 
locations with a ready source of water. Today, people routinely live in areas 
where water must be transported hundreds of miles from a distant water source. 
A great example of this is Las Vegas, NV where water is routed from hundreds of 
miles away and is recognized as the lifeline to it&rsquo;s survival. To 
accomplish this, the natural course of rivers gets rerouted without 
consideration for the long-term implications. Businesses have the ability to 
purchase the rights to divert water from a lake, river, aquifer, or other 
natural source further depleting reserves. Ultimately what occurs is that 
rivers and lakes that would normally be naturally replenished begin to dry up 
under the high demand of urban and residential growth. All the while, most 
residents are completely unaware that their valuable water resources are being 
increasingly contaminated while also slowly diminishing in availability.</p> 
<h2>We Need To Protect Our Water Supplies</h2> 
<p>Waters that were once generously replenished and filtered by nature are now 
being depleted and soiled by humans. This places a large percentage of the 
population at an increased risk from their drinking water as these once 
plentiful and pristine sources are becoming contaminated and scarce. For all of 
these reasons, it is increasingly important for individuals to monitor the 
water quality from their faucets and ensure they have a qualitywater filter at 
their disposal.&nbsp; Also, it&rsquo;s imperative that we become more proactive 
as a society in protecting our existing water supplies for future generations.

<h3>Outdated Water Infrastructures May Be A Health Hazard</h3> Thursday, 
September 30th, 2010 
<p>Water treatment plants are charged with keeping our water free of bacteria, 
poisonous chemicals, parasites and other waterborne toxins. However, keeping 
facilities manned, maintained and up to date is not cheap and requires 
substantial taxpayer dollars. Even in communities with state of the art 
treatment facilities, the infrastructure that connects these facilities to 
homes, businesses, and schools is often in dire need of repair and maintenance.
</p> 
<p>Extreme rainfall can deluge sewage systems, especially those systems that 
are called upon to manage both waste water and storm water runoff. Storm water 
and wastewater can then mix and overflow, ultimately resulting in contaminated 
drinking water.</p> 
<p>The problem is further complicated by limited taxpayer dollars set to the 
backdrop of towns and states facing major budget shortfalls. In Pittsburgh for 
example, officials are debating over how to fund needed updates to both their 
water treatment facilities and maintenance of sewer lines which were installed 
in 1912.</p> 
<p>The condition of infrastructure in Pennsylvania and across the nation has 
been in the spotlight as federal stimulus dollars begin to dry up. The 2010 
Report Card recently released by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave 
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water and waste water management systems failing grades. 
Local governments are looking to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s H2O funding 
announcements to help cover a small portion, but it is estimated that more than 
$25 billion will be required. Meanwhile, as this gets worked out, the risks to 
your health ever increase without a home water filter.</p> 
<p>The results of a recent study indicate that it may not even take a severe 
rain event to cause contamination of tap water. Dr. Marc Gorelick, chief of 
pediatric emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, led a group 
of researchers that studied the incidence of illnesses following rainfall.</p> 
<p>The study reviewed data detailing the number of emergency room visits by 
children due to gastroenteritis or diarrhea. Children were studied because 
they, along with the elderly and those in poor health, are the first ones to 
become ill following an assault upon their immune systems. Researchers found 
that the average number of emergency room visits increased by 11 percent for 
four days after any amount of rainfall. The study concluded that the incidence 
of waterborne illnesses occur more frequently even after comparatively mild 
rain events.</p> 
<p>Study collaborator Sandra McLellan is a senior scientist at the University 
of Wisconsin - Milwaukee&rsquo;s Great Lakes W.A.T.E.R. Institute (Wisconsin 
Aquatic Technology and Environmental Research). According to McLellan, water 
leaving Milwaukee&rsquo;s treatment plant is very high quality. Dr. Gorelick 
stated that the mystery &ldquo;is what happens to water between the time it 
leaves the treatment plant and gets to your tap.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The answer to that mystery likely lies in an aging infrastructure of pipes 
used to transport water. These pipes are kept under pressure and are designed 
to keep contaminants out of the treated water. However, this pressure can fail 
after a water main break results in a breach. This can also be an issue after 
rainfall saturates the surrounding soil, allowing contaminated water to leach 
into the piping system. In this way, even moderate rainfall or water events can 
contribute to drinking water contamination.</p> 
<p>These variables affect water after it leaves the treatment plant and makes 
it difficult to guarantee that water exiting the tap will be consistently safe. 
For this reason, spending the time and resources finding ahome water filter 
should be a top priority.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s In Our Drinking Water?</h3> Friday, September 24th, 2010 
<p>If you live in a city, you probably take your water quality for granted. 
After all, it is monitored regularly by law. However, this summer I was washing 
my car and I realized that if I didn&rsquo;t wipe the windows, the evaporated 
water would leave white stains on the glass. &ldquo;If this is pure water, why 
would it stain the window?&rdquo; I asked myself. Well, this didn&rsquo;t mean 
I had contaminated drinking water, but it motivated me to do some additional 
research into my what i was drinking. In doing so, I quickly learned that while 
we consider well and city water to be inherently safe to drink, this many times 
is far from the case.</p> 
<p>It began with me returning to the water quality report that I recently 
received. Though our city of 64,000 is located on a major river, the city does 
not get it&rsquo;s water from that river. Instead fifteen wells provide on 
average 9.25 million gallons of water per day. They did not state why the water 
utility does not use river water but I assume that, in the past, it was too 
easy to contaminate an open source, especially with manufacturing plants 
located on the banks.</p> 
<p>However, just because the water comes from wells does not mean it is ready 
for use. This can apply to all wells especially since we are seeing a large 
increase in the amount of undergroundkarsts and aquifers that are being 
contaminated by humans. The report goes on, &ldquo;The treatment plant then 
filters the water to remove iron and manganese before it is pumped into the 
water distribution system. These minerals are not a health concern and are 
removed because they can discolor the water and create a slight taste of 
iron.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>At the treatment plant the water is cleansed of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from 
sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and 
wildlife</li> 
<li>Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be 
naturally-occurring or result from urban storm water runoff, industrial or 
domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming</li> 
<li>Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such 
as agriculture, urban storm water runoff, and residential uses</li> 
<li>Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic 
chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum 
production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and 
septic systems</li> 
<li>Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the 
result of oil and gas production and mining activities.</li> </ul> 
<p>What I learned is that all of these are not atypical of what can be found 
in well water. Our city not only removes these unwanted chemicals and 
contaminants, but also makes their own chemical additions to the water; 
&ldquo;The water is also chlorinated for disinfection andfluoride is added for 
dental purposes before it is pumped into the water pipe system.&rdquo; From 
there the water goes to water towers for pressure, and then to homes, schools, 
businesses, and the like.</p> 
<p>Two lessons emerge from this study. First, if you are served by a private 
well, it is wise to have it tested regularly as water quality changes as the 
surrounding environment changes. The city must have theirs tested for EPA 
regulated contaminants every year, and larger cities have to run tests on their 
water daily. Second, even if you live on tested city water, it would be wise to 
take precaution and filter your drinking water with a high quality purifier 
like the black berkey, found in all ourBerkey water filters. This will 
guarantee that your water is safe, even if something unhealthy sneaks in 
unnoticed.</p>

<h3>How Do Hurricanes Affect Drinking Water?</h3> Wednesday, July 28th, 2010 
<p>As we all now, a hurricane is like a giant tornado, with winds circulating 
around a calm center at 75 mph or more. Yet even though we&rsquo;ve seen the 
devastation of a hurricane like Katrina, how many of us are fully prepared? 
Given we&rsquo;re well into the hurricane season, there&rsquo;s no better time 
to discuss the importance of preparing you and your family for the dangers.</p> 
<h2>2010 Hurricane Season</h2> 
<p>The hurricane season starts June 1st and ends November 30th, and again this 
year (2010) the National Hurricane Center has predicted an above average number 
of storms in the Atlantic. The first, category 2 hurricane Alex, appeared less 
than a month after the season began. At the rate of one a month, the Atlantic 
Ocean will surely reach its predicted quota.</p> 
<p>Initial fear that Alex would strike Florida proved unfounded. Instead the 
hurricane moved across the Gulf and slammed into Mexico, leaving several dead 
and millions of dollars in damage. That was good news for the United States, 
but of course bad news for Mexico.</p> 
<p>However, it was not all good news for the U.S.. The storm hampered cleanup 
progress of the BP oil disaster that started on April 20th and there is still 
serious concern that oil could be blown and stretched out across the Gulf of 
Mexico and it&rsquo;s beaches over the next couple months. This would obviously 
make cleanup much more difficult than it already is.</p> 
<p>Hurricane Katrina</p> 
<p>The destructive power of a hurricane is in the wind, but also in the amount 
of water it drops. Katrina, for example, dropped 15 inches of rain in some 
regions in less than a 24 hour period. An inch of rain drops 65,000 tons of 
water per square mile, and the average hurricane covers 8000 square miles! That 
much water inevitably has the potential to be very destructive!</p> 
<h2>Extreme Weather and Our Drinking Water</h2> 
<p>Why do weather extremes like this affect drinking water? Hurricane rain is 
not just unadulterated distilled water. It can often contain chemicals similar 
to acid rain yet also churn up undrinkable salt water from the ocean that 
causes corrosive damage. This water essentially has a negative impact on any 
source of drinking water it touches. This is particularly noticeable in rural 
areas where high volumes of run-off from fields containing fertilizers and 
other chemicals can quicklycontaminate&nbsp; karsts and private wells.</p> 
<p>In more populated ares, polluted floodwater is typically an even bigger 
concern as it mixes and contaminates the water supplies of municipal water 
systems. Damage to municipal water pipes is often a part of storm destruction, 
and this means that safe drinking water is unable to get to homes and 
individuals on that pipeline for days, weeks, and sometimes months.</p> 
<p>Make Sure You Are Prepared</p> 
<h2>Prepare Yourself and Your Family</h2> 
<p>Knowing all this, how can one be prepared for a possible hurricane 
disaster? Of course, some parts of a disaster are unavoidable and they must be 
endured until the crisis is over. But other foreseeable problems can be a part 
of the preparation. For example, if you live in a flood plain, or along the 
coasts where hurricanes (or typhoons on the Pacific coast) may occur, it would 
be wise to stock up on food, clean water or a water filter, and at least a 2 
day responder pack for your family. These are just the basics, but every family 
should begin with this foundation for preparedness. Do you research as many 
disaster survival companies have just the sort of supplies you would need.</p> 
<p>For water security, we recommend purchasing a gravity fed water filter like 
the Berkey water filter. These are very efficient in removing virtually 
anything that may threaten your health such as pathogenic bacteria and 
chemicals. Theberkey filter will provide clean drinking and cooking water you 
could trust for the duration of the disaster that you experience. There is a 
peace of mind in knowing that you have water security for you and your family 
in the event of a potential hurricane disaster.</p>

<h3>E. Coli Contamination of Drinking Water</h3> Tuesday, June 15th, 2010 
<p>E. coli, short for Escherichia coli, is a type of fecal coliform bacteria 
commonly found in the intestines of animals and humans. If ingested, this 
bacteria can result in serious sickness and even death. When E. coli 
contaminates your drinking water, one should either avoid drinking it 
completely, or render it safe by boiling the water or purifying it with a high 
quality water filter.</p> 
<p>During rainfalls, snow melts, or other types of precipitation, E. coli may 
be washed into creeks, rivers, streams, lakes, or ground water. When these 
waters are used as sources of drinking water and the water is not adequately 
treated, E. coli may be inadvertently ingested.</p> 
<p>Most of the hundreds of strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the 
intestines of healthy humans and animals. However E. coli O157:H7 is an 
exception; as it produces a powerful toxin. Evidence but not proof of ingestion 
includes severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or non-bloody diarrhea. 
Frequently, a fever will not be one of the symptoms.</p> 
<p>In 2%-7% of those infected with E. coli O157:H7, the bacterium will also 
cause hemolytic uremic syndrome. This is evident when the red blood cells are 
destroyed and the kidneys fail. This condition is a life threatening and may 
require blood transfusions and kidney dialysis as treatments.</p> 
<p>Symptoms usually appear within two to four days, but could take longer. 
With this strain of E. coli, antibiotics should be avoided as they can some 
exacerbate kidney problems. Recovery within five to ten days usually follows 
without antibiotics. Any person who has sudden bloody diarrhea should get their 
stool tested for E. coli O157:H7 immediately. Children under five, the elderly, 
and those with weak immune systems are the most vulnerable.</p> 
<p>You might ask, &ldquo;Is my drinking water vulnerable to E. coli 
O157:H7?&rdquo; Public water is by law constantly monitored for all bacterial 
contamination. However, those using private sources and wells for water should 
be cautious, especially when farm animals are present, as these sources 
typically do not have routine E. Coli monitoring. The addition of chlorine, or 
treatment of water with ultra-violet light or ozone will kill or inactivate 
this strain of E. coli.</p> 
<p>If you have determined that your drinking water is contaminated, then one 
of the the safest procedures is to boil your water. In addition, there are high 
quality water purifiers on the market that will also remove E. Coli.&nbsp; One 
of these water purifiers is the Berkey water filter. With the ability to remove 
E. coli bacteria to a log 7 degree, or 99.99999%, theBerkey water filter will 
render contaminated drinking water safe to drink. Purchasing a Berkey water 
purifier is a relatively inexpensive way to provide peace of mind for you and 
your family.</p>

<h3>20% of Municipalities Violate Safe Drinking Water Act - NYT Reports</h3> 
Saturday, December 12th, 2009 
<p>This week, the New York Times reported on it&rsquo;s disturbing findings of 
an investigation into the US municipal water systems that serve millions of 
Americans.&nbsp;It highlights failures and obvious enforcement gaps in current 
government regulations that we&rsquo;ve assumed are protecting our drinking 
water, including the realization that 20 percent of the nation&rsquo;s water 
treatment systems have violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
</p> 
<h2>Water Quality (Un)enforcement</h2> 
<p>The discovery that municipalities fail water quality reports is nothing 
new, but what&rsquo;s a little surprising is that the majority of&nbsp; 
municipalities that received violations were never penalized for their failures 
in meeting water safety requirements.&nbsp;Many were given a pass under the 
impression that fining would be counterproductive to cash-strapped 
municipalities. This has serious ramifications to our public health and needs 
to be regarded as such.</p> 
<h2>Contaminants in our Drinking Water</h2> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve written about in earlier articles, this is partly a byproduct 
of the public&rsquo;s assumption that our drinking water is safe with no 
spotlight being placed on the regulators. The American people are coping with 
many other personal and financial issues, and unless it makes headlines, they 
are unaware of the continuing destruction of our water sources thanks to human 
pollution.&nbsp; As the NYT points out, water treatment facilities are 
struggling with the current identified list of monitored contaminants, but this 
is only half the story. The cold hard fact is that there exists an inability 
for private and government organizations to keep pace in identifying and 
filtering out the swelling number of chemicals that continue to show up in our 
water supply. As long as we continue to increase our use of chemicals in 
products and manufacturing, then it&rsquo;s a safe bet to assume that the 
chemicals and contaminants found in our water will continue to increase in 
lockstep.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>We Must Improve Our Drinking Water Quality Regulations</h2> 
<p>In this New York Times report, many of the water contaminants that show 
links to cancer were the very same contaminants that these towns were found to 
be in violation of.&nbsp; In one referenced example, &ldquo;the E.P.A. has 
reported that more than three million Americans have been exposed since 2005 to 
drinking water with illegal concentrations of arsenic and radioactive elements, 
both of which have been linked to cancer at small doses.&rdquo;&nbsp;As was 
mentioned in ourlead in our drinking water post, schools are far from exempt 
from this poor water quality problem, as a more recent article by the NYT on 
Dec 8th covers;Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on EPA 
School Water Quality We need to continue to increase out awareness of how we 
affect the water supply through pollution and daily living habits, but we must 
also be aware that water we had originally assumed was healthy for consumption 
may require a run through a qualitywater filter prior to drinking.</p>
