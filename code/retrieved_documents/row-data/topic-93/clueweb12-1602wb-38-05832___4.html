<h2>Four Decades</h2> <br>

<h2>Tips For Water Conservation and Safety</h2> <br>

<p> The summer is a time for hot weather and enjoying our lakes, rivers and 
streams. It is also a time when we tend to have our water closer to the 
forefront of our minds. Sometimes it seems like there is not much we can do to 
protect the health and vitality of our water because these problems seem too 
big. Increasingly, we all share a responsibility to do our part to protect our 
waters. How we use water, what happens to the rainwater falling on our lands 
and what we send down our drains are the next greatest challenges we must face 
together.</p> 
<p> Clean Water Action would like to offer a few tips that each of us can do 
at home to help protect, restore and conserve our precious water resources:</p> 
<p> <strong>Conserving water in your home:</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Conserve electricity. The largest use of water in Minnesota is for energy 
production.</li> 
<li>Turn off water when brushing your teeth and shaving.</li> 
<li>Use low-flow showerheads and take shorter showers.</li> 
<li>Use low-flow aerators on the faucets in your house.</li> 
<li>Only wash a full load of dishes and clothes. Don&rsquo;t pre-wash dishes 
but do scrape off large pieces of food. Modern dishwashers tend to use less 
water per load than washing by hand.</li> 
<li>Store filtered tap water in a pitcher in the fridge instead of bottled 
water.</li> </ul> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>Keeping our water safe at home:</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use green cleaning products that are safer for our waters as well as our 
families. Many of the most common cleaning chemicals have safer and less 
expensive alternatives. The Responsible Purchasing Network provides aproducts 
database of GreenSeal and/or EcoLogo certified cleaning products. Recipes for 
homemade cleaning products can be found atDo It Green.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t dispose of household hazardous waste down the drain, in the 
storm drains or on the driveway. These include solvents, pesticides and paint.
Contact your county to find your local hazardous waste disposal options.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t dispose of medications down the drain. Instead, check with the 
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for guidelines on disposal of unused 
medications or contact your county sheriff.</li> </ul> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>Landscaping for better water:</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid watering your lawn except under severe drought conditions. Cool 
season grasses may turn brown and go dormant in the middle of the summer but 
will re-grow when rain and cooler weather returns.</li> 
<li>Use native plants appropriate for your area and plants that require a low 
water input. Native plants often require considerably fewer fertilizers, 
pesticides and maintenance.</li> 
<li>Harvest and keep rainwater on your site by using rain barrels, rain 
gardens and permeable paving. Urban storm water washes over hard surfaces, 
moving large volumes of water, sediment and pollution to sewers and adjoining 
water bodies.</li> 
<li>Avoid putting any yard waste and leaves in the gutters and storm drains. 
This waste will eventually end up untreated in our waterways. Either dispose of 
yard waste as directed by your county or city or use the waste as compost or 
mulch.</li> 
<li>Other landscaping tips can be found at the University of Minnesota

<p><strong>2010 Legislative Summary</strong></p> 
<p>The 2010 legislative session ended in the early morning hours of May 17 
after a brief special session was called by the Governor. Fights over the state 
budget and funding for health care and education dominated the atmosphere at 
the Capitol, making it a tough year to pass meaningful environmental 
legislation. However, once again Clean Water Action was able to celebrate 
several legislative victories this session. In addition to passing another bill 
to keep toxins out of our environment, we were able to stop attempts to weaken 
current environment laws and move Minnesota towards dirty energy options.</p> 
<p><strong>Earth Day Birthday Bash Highlights</strong></p> 
<p>Clean Water Action members, volunteers, allies and staff celebrated Earth 
Day&rsquo;s 40th Birthday with food, fun and activism!</p> 
<p><strong>Restoring the Clean Water Act</strong></p> 
<p>The drinking water sources for nearly 1 million Minnesotans are at risk of 
losing Clean Water Act protections. Congress now has an opportunity to fix this 
and restore protections weakened by the Supreme Court and Bush Administration.

<p>Clean Water Action would like to offer a few tips that each of us can do at 
home to help protect, restore and conserve our precious water resources</p> 
<p><strong>Pesticide Issues Gain Urgency At Federal Level</strong></p> 
<p>Pesticide issues have gained momentum and long awaited attention at the 
federal level this year. Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota is leading the 
fight to ban the highly toxic and commonly used pesticide atrazine, the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to disclose inert ingredients 
in pesticides and the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel released a report stating 
that chemicals threaten our bodies.</p> 
<p><strong>Meet Our Canvassers - Is This Job In Your Future?</strong></p>

<p>Here is what phone canvass manager, Terrance Noble, and field canvass 
manager, Anna Waugh, have to say about working for the Clean Water Action 
canvasses.</p> 
<p><strong>Summer Campgaign Updates</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Creating Healthy Homes and Healthy Water</strong></p> 
<p>Clean Water Action continues our work to protect environmental and human 
health from toxic chemical exposure through our involvement in the Healthy 
Legacy Coalition. This past year, we educated over 500 Minnesotans about how to 
reduce their toxic chemical exposure in their homes and actively support 
protective policies with our Healthy Home Presentations. If you would like to 
host a Healthy Home, Healthy Water Presentation in your community, contactKim 
LaBo.</p> 
<p><strong>Preserving the Great Lakes</strong></p> 
<p>The potential invasion of Asian Carp has been one of the dominant Great 
Lakes issues as of late. Asian Carp are voracious eaters that have been moving 
up the Mississippi River system threatening native species wherever they go. An 
electric fence was constructed near Chicago to prevent the carp from traveling 
from the Illinois River through the artificial canal system and into Lake 
Michigan. Unfortunately, last year Asian Carp DNA was found in the waterway 
beyond the electric fence sparking fears the fish have breached the barrier and 
will establish themselves in the Great Lakes. Efforts since then have focused 
on a dual track of determining the extent of the immediate problem and finding 
a long-term solution. Initial results are promising that they have not 
established themselves in the Great Lakes, yet, but efforts will continue to 
determine the extent of the Asian Carp invasion.</p> 
<p><strong>Climate and Clean Energy</strong></p> 
<p>Clean Water Action and all of the other activists and allies working for 
strong, comprehensive climate and energy legislation are still waiting for the 
introduction of new climate and energy legislation by US Senators Kerry (D-MA) 
and Lieberman (I-CT). These senators have been working with Senator Graham 
(R-SC) to craft a bill capable of passing the Senate since earlier efforts 
stalled. A draft was released during the middle of May.</p>
