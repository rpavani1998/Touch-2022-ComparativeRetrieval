<h1>EARTH TALK: Collecting rain water from your gutters' downspouts is a 
no-brainer</h1> 
<h2></h2>  September 25, 2009 3:49 PM | Print Story | E-Mail Story <br>

<p>Dear EarthTalk: How can I make good use of the rainwater that runs down my 
roof and into my gutters?</p> 
<p>-- Brian Smith</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For most of us, the rain that falls on our roof runs off into the ground or 
the sewer system. But if you&rsquo;re motivated to save a little water and 
re-distribute it on your lawns or plants - or even use it for laundry, dishes 
or other interior needs - collecting rainwater from your gutters&rsquo; 
downspouts is a no-brainer.</p> 
<p>If it&rsquo;s allowed in your state, that is. Utah and parts of Washington 
State have antiquated but nonetheless tough laws banning anyone but owners of 
water rights from collecting rainwater flowing off privately owned rooftops.</p>
<p>Such laws are rarely enforced, however, and one in Colorado was recently 
overturned.</p> 
<p>According to John C. Davis, writing in E &ndash; The Environmental 
Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof 
and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 
2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of runoff, one can harvest 
enough to supply all the water needs of a family of four for about two weeks.
</p> 
<p>Of course, most of us would only use rainwater to irrigate our lawn or 
garden, and there should be plenty to go around for doing that in all but the 
most drought stricken areas.</p> 
<p>Plants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap 
water, which is usually treated with softeners that actually inhibit plant 
growth. And, reports Davis, the lack of minerals in rainwater actually makes it 
more effective than tap water for shampooing or doing dishes.</p> 
<p>Using rainwater for plumbing uses can also extend the life of pipes and 
water heaters, since the salts added to tap water facilitate corrosion. 
Homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use 
rainwater for interior needs.</p> 
<p>Beyond the benefits to individual homeowners, rainwater harvesting can also 
be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding and 
pollution runoff associated with heavy rainfall, and lessens reliance on public 
water supplies, alleviating some of the burden on utilities. Given these 
benefits, some states, including even drought-prone Texas, subsidize 
residential rainwater collection systems.</p> 
<p>Many varieties of rain barrel systems, starting at just $100, are available 
for home installation.</p> 
<p>A typical set-up is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter&rsquo;s 
downspout. &ldquo;The barrel is typically fitted with a spigot at its base to 
fill a watering can or attach a soaker hose (which bleeds out water all along 
its length, providing effortless drip irrigation), and a filter or screen at 
its top to prevent a buildup of leaves and other debris,&rdquo; wrote Davis.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a single 100 gallon 
rain barrel can save up to 1,300 gallons of utility-provided water during the 
high demand summer months.</p> 
<p>Handy homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying 
one pre-made is a lot easier. Most nurseries and garden centers offer a range 
of choices (as well as advice), but websites such as Aquabarrel, Clean Air 
Gardening and Rainxchange make it easy to order a system online.</p>
