<h4>We ALL Can Use Water Wisely in the Garden Learn How YOU Can Do Your Part
</h4> 
<p>Thanks to the Cumberland River Nashville has an abundant supply of water. 
But it's important that we all use water wisely, especially on our lawns and 
gardens and other times when we don't really need to use drinking water to get 
the job done. Fixing leaky faucets, catching rinse water in a bowl to water 
outdoor plants, and even catching rain water in a bucket to use when you scrub 
the patio are smart yet simple ideas that we call can use to save water and 
save money.</p> 
<h4>FOOD GARDEN SAFETY</h4> 
<p> For information on vegetable/fruit gardens that were flooded or splashed 
by river water during the flood, please see<strong>Safety of Produce from 
Flooded Gardens</strong> from University of Wisconsin Extension.</p> 
<p><strong>What is a Rain Barrel?</strong><br>
 To the average homeowner, a 
rain barrel is merely a simple and inexpensive way to catch and store rainwater 
as it flows from a building's roof into the gutters and downspouts. This stored 
water then becomes a great alternative to tap/city water and can be used during 
periods of dry or drought to water gardens, trees, and other plants. This is 
FREE WATER and obviously the homeowner saves money.</p>

<p>How To Make Your Own Rain Barrel A simple and inexpensive way to catch and 
store rainwater that can later be used to water your lawns and gardens during 
dry periods.</p> 
<h4><strong>ABOUR RAIN BARRELS</strong></h4> 
<p><strong>Why is a Rain Barrel good for the Environment?</strong><br>
 Water 
coming from your tap has been treated at the treatment plant in order to make 
it suitable for drinking. This process requires large amounts of energy; 
therefore using rainwater instead of treated tap/city water for irrigating 
plants saves energy. Second, stormwater falling on an impervious area such as 
pavement, concrete, or a rooftop generally drains straight to a storm drain, 
ditch, or directly into a creek instead of soaking into the ground. As these 
impervious areas drain; the stormwater carries whatever pollutants (herbicides, 
pesticides, fertilizers, dog waste, etc.) it picks up along the way and 
deposits them into our streams. Impervious areas also mean that water that 
would have otherwise been absorbed into the ground and gradually seeped back 
into our streams over a period of days, now flows straight through our stream 
system in the course of hours, many times causing flooding. This accelerated 
draining process not only increases flooding but it also leaves our streams 
lower and drier for longer periods of time. Therefore, if we catch stormwater 
in a barrel and later release this water back into the ground when watering our 
gardens and trees, we're both decreasing the flooding that rain event would 
have otherwise caused<em>and </em>helping to replenish the ground water and the 
streams during that period of dry when the streams need it most.</p> 
<p><strong>Why is a Rain Barrel good for your plants?</strong><br>
 Rain is 
naturally soft water and devoid of minerals, chlorine, fluoride, and other 
chemicals. For this reason, Plants respond very well to rainwater.<br>
 How 
much water can you collect? For every inch of rainfall that falls on a 
catchment area of 1,000 sq. ft. you can expect to collect approximately 600 
gallons of rain water. Your roof catchment area is equal to the total square 
feet of your house (one story) plus the extension of your eaves. To calculate 
the square footage of your home's catchment area, measure the outside walls of 
your home, including the overhang of any eaves. Multiply the width times the 
length of your home to get the total roof catchment area. Let's say your home 
has a roof catchment area of 2,000 sq. feet. Since one inch of rainfall 
provides approximately 600 gallons of water for a 1,000 sq. ft catchment area, 
you could collect 1200 gallons during a 1&rdquo; rain.More Information</p> 
<p><strong>Installation of a Rain Barrel</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Position the rain barrel (with blocks under it) adjacent to a downspout 
and<em>remove </em>enough of the downspout (with a hacksaw) so that there is 
ample room to attach a 45 degree elbow still allowing the rain barrel to easily 
fit underneath with approximately 2&quot; of clearance.<br>
</li> 
<li> Your rain barrel must be secured on a raised, <em>level </em>surface 
(like concrete blocks). A full 55 gallon rain barrel weighs<em>over </em>400 
Ibs. and tipping is a risk if it is unsecured or on<em>uneven </em>ground.<br>

</li> 
<li><em> Divert </em>your <em>overflow </em>to a safe discharge location away 
from your homes foundation.<br>
</li> 
<li> The barrel must <em>have </em>a lid and a fine mesh screen covering any 
openings to<em>prevent </em>mosquitoes and debris from getting inside.<br>
</li>
<li> Do not use moss control or other chemicals on your roof that are not 
garden safe.<br>
</li> 
<li> NEVER use water from the rain barrel for drinking, cooking or other 
potable uses.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Periodically brush the screen to prevent accumulation of debris.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Winterizing</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> Discontinue use of your rain barrel before the first frost.<br>
</li> 
<li> Empty the rain barrel completely.<br>
</li> 
<li>Clean the rain barrel with mild dishwashing liquid.<br>
</li> 
<li>Store the rain barrel upside down to prevent water from collecting in it.
