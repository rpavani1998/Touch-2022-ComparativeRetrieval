 &#65279; Water is Life 
<p>Protecting Our &nbsp;World</p> 
<p>The amount of water on Earth now is about the same as it was millions 
&nbsp;of years ago.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Water regulates the Earth&rsquo;s temperature. &nbsp;It also regulates the 
temperature of the human</p> 
<p> body.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Less than 2% of the Earth&rsquo;s water supply is fresh water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Of all the earth&rsquo;s water, 97% is salt water found in oceans and seas. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Only 1% of the earth&rsquo;s water is available for drinking water. 
&nbsp;The remaining 2% is frozen.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The human body is about 75% water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>A person can survive about a month without food, but only 5 to 7 days 
without water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Every day in the United States, we drink about 110 million gallons of water.
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Landscaping accounts for about half the water used at home. &nbsp;Showers 
account for another</p> 
<p>18 percent, while toilets use about 20 percent.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Showering and bathing are the largest indoor uses (27%) of water 
domestically</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot of water. &nbsp;Therefore, 2000 
cubic feet of water is 14,560 gallons.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>An acre foot of water is about 326,000 gallons. &nbsp;One-half acre foot is 
enough to meet the needs of a typical family for a year. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>It takes 3.3 acre feet of water to grow enough food for an average family 
for a year.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>A leaky faucet can waste 100 gallons a day.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>If every household in America had a faucet that dripped once each second, 
928 million gallons of water a day would leak away.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>One flush of the toilet uses 6 &frac12; gallons of water. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>An average family of four uses 881 gallons of water per week just by 
flushing the toilet.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Avoid flushing the toilet unnecessarily. &nbsp;Dispose of tissues, insects 
and other such waste in the trash rather than the toilet.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>An average bath requires 37 gallons of water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The average 5-minute shower takes 15 to 25 gallons water &ndash; around 40 
gallons are used in 10 minutes.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Take short showers instead of baths. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>You use about 5 gallons of water if you leave the water running while 
brushing your teeth or shaving.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The use of water-saving toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators can 
result in a 45% savings in water use.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Each person needs to drink about 2 &frac12; quarts (80 ounces) of water 
every day.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Store drinking water in the refrigerator rather than letting the faucet run 
every time you want a cool glass of water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> You don&rsquo;t need to buy bottled water for health reasons if your 
drinking water meets all of the federal, state and local drinking water 
standards. &nbsp;Bottled water can cost up to 1000 times more than municipal 
drinking water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>You can refill an 8-oz. glass of water approximately 15,000 times for the 
same cost as a six-pack of soda pop.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>A dairy cow must drink 4 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of milk.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Run your dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>A top-loading clothes washer uses between 40 and 55 gallons of water per 
load. &nbsp;Front-loading models use roughly half that amount.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>When washing dishes by hand, fill one sink or basin with soapy water. 
&nbsp;Quickly rinse under a slow-moving stream from the faucet.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Never put water down the drain when there may be another use for it such as 
watering a plant or garden, or cleaning.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>An automatic dishwasher uses 9 to 12 gallons of water while hand washing 
dishes can use up to 20 gallons.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Use a bowl of water to clean fruits and vegetables rather than running 
water over them. &nbsp;You can reuse this for your houseplants.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>If you water your grass and trees more heavily, but less often, this saves 
water and builds stronger roots.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Water your lawn only when it needs it. &nbsp;If you step on the grass and 
it springs back up when you move, it doesn&rsquo;t need water. &nbsp;If it 
stays flat, it does need water.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Water lawns during the early morning hours or evening when temperatures and 
wind speed are the lowest. &nbsp;This reduces losses from evaporation. &nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Running a sprinkler for 2 hours can use up to 500 gallons of water. 
&nbsp;Up to 90% of water used to sprinkle lawns can be lost to the atmosphere 
through evaporation</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Use a rain catch system (rain barrel) and use natural rain water for 
watering in the yard</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Do not hose down your driveway or sidewalk. &nbsp;Use a broom to clean 
leaves and other debris from these areas. &nbsp;Using a hose to clean a 
driveway uses about 50 gallons of water every 5 minutes.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> When washing a car, use soap and water from a bucket. &nbsp;Use a hose 
with a shut-off nozzle for rinsing. &nbsp;As much as 150 gallons of water can 
be saved by turning off the hose between rinses.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Public water suppliers process 38 billion gallons of water per day for 
domestic and public use.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Approximately 1 million miles of pipelines and aqueducts carry water in the 
United States and Canada. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s enough pipe to circle the earth 40 
times.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>About 800,000 water wells are drilled each year in the United States for 
domestic, farming, commercial, and water testing purposes.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>More than 13 million households get their water from their own private 
wells and are responsible for</p> 
<p>Treating And pumping the water themselves.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Industries released 197 million pounds of toxic chemicals into waterways in 
1990.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>300 million gallons of water are needed to produce a single day&rsquo;s 
supply of U. S. newsprint.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>One inch of rainfall drops 7,000 gallons or nearly 30 tons of water on a 
60&rsquo; by 180&rsquo; piece of land.</p>

<h6>No drips</h6> 
<p>A dripping faucet can waste 20 gallons of water a day. &nbsp;A leaking 
toilet can use 90,000 gallons of water in a month. &nbsp;Get out the wrench and 
change the washers on your sinks and showers, or get new washer less faucets. 
&nbsp;Keeping your existing equipment well maintained is probably the easiest 
and cheapest way to start saving water.</p> 
<h6>Install new fixtures</h6> 
<p>New, low-volume or dual flush toilets, low-flow showerheads, water-
efficient dishwashers and clothes washing machines can all save a great deal of 
water and money. &nbsp;Aerators on yours faucets can significantly reduce water 
volume; water-saving showerheads can cut the volume of water used down to 1.2 
gallons per minute or less. &nbsp;Splurging on a low-flow toilet could save 
another 50 to 80 gallons of water a day. &nbsp;Together, those changes could 
cut the household&rsquo;s daily use of water by nearly one-half &ndash; saving 
a considerable amount of water and money.</p> 
<h6>Cultivate good water habits</h6> 
<p>All the water that goes down the drain, clean or dirty, ends up mixing with 
raw sewage, getting contaminated, and meeting the same fate. &nbsp;Try to stay 
aware of this precious resource disappearing. &nbsp;Turn off the water while 
brushing your teeth or shaving; wash laundry and dishes with full loads; take 
shorter showers, etc. &nbsp;</p> 
<h6>Stay off the bottle</h6> 
<p>By many measures, bottled water is a scam. &nbsp;Bottled water is not as 
well regulated as municipal water and often is not even particularly pure. 
&nbsp;Much bottled water is just tap water anyway. &nbsp;Bottled water is more 
expensive per gallon than gasoline and incurs a huge carbon footprint from it 
transportation. &nbsp;The discarded bottles are a blight in the landscape and 
the landfill. &nbsp;If you want to carry water with you, use a refillable 
bottle.</p> 
<h6>Go beyond the lawn</h6> 
<p>Naturalize your lawn using locally appropriate plants that are hardy and 
don&rsquo;t need a lot of water. &nbsp;Water in the coolest part of the day to 
minimize evaporation. &nbsp;Drip irrigation is a better choice than using a 
sprinkler system.</p> 
<h6>Harvest your rainwater</h6> 
<p>Put a rain barrel on your downspouts and use this water for irrigation. 
&nbsp;Rain cisterns come in all shapes and sizes ranging from larger 
underground systems to smaller, freestanding ones.</p> 
<h6>Harvest your grey water</h6> 
<p>Water that has been used at least once but is still clean enough for other 
jobs is called greywater. &nbsp;Water from sinks, showers, dishwashers, and 
clothes washers are the most common household examples. &nbsp;(Toilet water is 
often called &ldquo;blackwater&rdquo; and needs a different level of treatment 
before it can be used.) &nbsp;Greywater can be recycled with practical plumbing 
systems (such as Aqus) or with simple practices such as emptying the fish tank 
in the garden instead of the sink. &nbsp;The bottom line? &nbsp;One way or 
another, avoid putting water down the drain when you can use it for something 
else.</p> 
<h6>At the car wash</h6> 
<p>Car washes are often more efficient than home washing and the water is 
treated rather than letting it go straight into the sewer system. &nbsp;Check 
to make sure that they clean and recycle the later.</p> 
<h6>Keep your eyes open</h6> 
<p>Report broken pipes, open hydrants, and excessive water waste. 
&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be shy about pointing out leaks to your friends and family 
members, either. &nbsp;They might have turned out the dripping sound a long 
time ago.</p> 
<h6>Don&rsquo;t spike the punch</h6> 
<p>Water sources have to be protected. &nbsp;In many closed loop systems like 
those in cities in the GreatLakes, waste water is returned to the Lake that 
fresh water comes out of. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t pout chemicals down drains, or 
flush drugs down toilets; it could come back in diluted form in your water.</p>
