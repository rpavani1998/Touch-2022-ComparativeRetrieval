<h2>  Affordable Biomass Stoves Fight Pollution in India </h2>  Written by 
Jaymi Heimbuch on 10/07/08 <br>

<p><br>
 Indoor pollution is a major cause of death for people in developing 
countries due to the inefficiency and uncleanly burning of indoor stoves. 
Indoor air pollution-related deaths claim the lives of 1.5 million people a 
year, mainly women and children. It's easy to imagine someone keeling over 
after breathing in all that smoke and the yuck that's in it.Envirofit, a  US  
nonprofit focused on engineering, has partnered with UK  charity Shell 
Foundation to design and build affordable clean-burning biomass stoves to 
protect against indoor pollution, starting in  India .</p> 
<p>The newly designed stoves reduce harmful emissions by as much as 80% - a 
significant percentage that will go a long way to improving not only air 
quality, but the quality of life of people who use the stoves. They&rsquo;re 
less expensive to run because they use half the fuel of traditional stoves, 
while still using the same sources of fuel such as wood, crop waste and animal 
dung that the users typically burn. And the stoves have an added perk of 
speeding cooking time up by as much as 40%, which I'm sure is helpful to 
harried mothers. Cultural relativism was taken into consideration, with the new 
stoves adhering to the unique cooking methods of Indian women. The team will 
move on to other areas including Africa and Central and South America , 
designing clean-burning stoves to fit the residents.</p> 
<p>Envirofit as an organization goes beyond just stoves, fighting pollution in 
developing countries through fixing up two-stroke engines, and they&rsquo;re 
working on cost-effectively retrofitting emissions-spewing two-stroke engines 
with direct injection technology. They&rsquo;re starting up this endeavor with 
the  Philippines .</p>

&gt; cooking the foods in fire burn by <br>

camels etc.. ,} urgently in all villages of south Asia, Africa, poor countries 
of south America, central Asia ,south east Asia, who use woods, dried cow dung, 
buffalos dung,..., for cooking purposes, so that we can urgently stop further 
destruction of scare, very useful forests, and urgently stop of further damages 
, destruction soil [due to burning of dung of domestic animals, which was and 
is to be very useful natural fertilizers [compost fertilizers] for soil, 
urgently stop the ever increasing misuse of chemical fertilizers, in the soil 
for agriculture purposes because people of villages of above regions, are 
having less and less dung of domestic animals to make compost fertilizers, due 
to uncontrolled, ever increasing human population in these third world 
countries . As the human population of above mentioned third world countries, 
was and is increasing rapidly, the numbers and volume kitchens burn by fire 
woods ,dried cow dung, buffalos dung,..., are also increasing rapidly for 
cooking purposes by the uncontrolled, ever increasing human population, in 
these third world countries, by which was and is causing ever increasing 
pollution of soils, water resources. urgently stop the further air and 
atmospheric pollution due to ever increasing burning of above mentioned fire 
woods, dung of domestic animals for cooking purposes by the uncontrolled, ever 
increasing human population, in these third world countries, so that we can 
urgently stop the further damages and destruction of ecology, environments,...

immediately start to construct the massive

overpopulated, over crowded, over polluted, cities of the whole world , 
particularly compulsorily make above mentioned electric underground railways 
system in all the cities of impoverished third world countries, where more than 
90 % of these regions of third world countries are situated in very hot , very 
dry, dusty , highly polluted regions. compulsorily promote ridding bicycles by 
the public even by king, queen, prime ministers, ministers , and all the vip, 
and common people , poor people..... compulsorily promote public buses in every 
nook and corners of all cities even in late night times, compulsorily promote 
efficient mass transient systems in all over the world. compulsorily and 
urgently construct, build above mentioned mass communication, mass transient 
systems in all third world countries .compulsorily construct, built efficient 
electric rail ways system like bullet trains of Japan in all over the world but 
compulsorily construct, built in all third world regions. from now onwards in 
all over the world. immediately stop to built, construct heavy, bullet proof , 
luxurious, super heavy, super fashionable motor vehicles for ultra luxurious 
lives, for romance of heroes, heroines, super stars, for ultra fashion, 
honeymoon,..... .....................other wise you will certainly die like 
Indian cheater, most corrupt,........... Guru. osho bhagban Rajneesh, Michel 
Jackson,. who was one of the un polite human being in this earth, extremely 
undisciplined, extremely vulgar,............. young man and due to god is 
almighty there must be so many criminal human souls waiting for god's judgment 
in the long line in coming days....... from now onwards in all over the world. 
try our best to harvest the rain water however, wherever possible, to store the 
above mentioned rain water however, wherever possible in all over the world .in 
these rapidly growing concrete jungles age, and concrete jungle's world let us 
try and do our best to plant trees, shrubs, grasses ,.. with help regular 
irrigation with store rain water so that we urgently make dry , dusty land , 
concrete jungles into green, non polluted, clean cities, town, villages in all 
over the world. let us try our best to make the roof of the our home, houses, 
buildings, each and every concrete jungles of the whole world , green if 
possible green for whole year by planting small types of plants in flower pots 
, irrigate these plants with harvested and stored rain water. which will help 
us to breath the clean air easily, easily to see [ look] all around, easily to
