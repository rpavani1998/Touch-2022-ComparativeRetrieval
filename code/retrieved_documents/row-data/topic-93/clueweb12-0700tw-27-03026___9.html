<p>Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. The vaunted cold shutdown announcements 
of December by the Three Stooges in Tokyo just keeps sounding more and more 
like Grimms fairy tales.</p> 
<p>Is there not a single leader in Japan who can rally the people? If not they 
will all surely face a long painful future of sudden deaths, birth defects, and 
the collapse of a 6,000 year-old culture.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the culture is so corrupt at the top that there is no hope for 
salvation. Perhaps it is time for the Japanese Exodus to save the race.</p> 
<p>Perhsps thevarchipelago is finished... Suitable only to send condemned 
prisoners and nuclear waste from every plant in the world. Mankind has crapped 
in the waters of Mother Earth one time too many in Japan.</p> </li> </ul>
