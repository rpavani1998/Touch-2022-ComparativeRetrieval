<p>First, great appreciation to the staff for all your work in keeping the 
public informed. This is an incredible public service.</p> 
<p>Regarding the validity of tap water measurements: As best I can determine, 
UCB gets it's tap water from EBMUD, which gets its water from sources far from 
Berkeley. The sources are apparently in the Sierra Nevada mountains, where 
there is record snow pack this year. This raises a couple of problems in 
comparing Berkeley rain water with tap water. 1. The rainfall in the Sierra may 
not have even reached the water sources constituting the tap water tested; for 
example, the recent rains may still be unmelted snow; 2. The amount of dilution 
is impossible to tell, as there may be a delay in transport (water &quot;in the 
pipeline&quot;); and 3. The rainfall a hundred or more miles away may not have 
the same content as that in Berkeley.</p> 
<p>Although inconvenient, a more valid comparison would be to take samples 
from local reservoirs (Marin County has several) to compare to air/rainfall.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your good work.</p>

<p>This seems to be a valid question. I don't see diatribes or conspiratorial 
rants. I see legitimate questions. Anyone care to answer?</p>

reservoirs (Marin County has several) to compare to air/rainfall</p>

<p>Is anyone on the team willing to tackle this problem? Or at least 
acknowledge that there is a disconnect between local rainwater measurements and 
distant tap water measurements. Many communities in the Bay Area, from the 
Central Valley and Walnut Creek to Mill Valley to San Jose do not get their 
water from the far away frozen Sierras. Can you test ANY local reservoir water 
(or even Lake Temescal or Grand Lake for that matter)? How about after 
tonight/tomorrow morning's predicted rains? Would it help if someone brought 
you samples?</p>

<p>Thanks UCB for this data and your hard work. I am a little confused by the 
update today as well where you state that tap water is what we should be 
focusing on. Why is rainwater not important? Is it ok to drink this rainwater? 
Can I bathe in it if I collect rainwater? I use solar power and rainwater for a 
lot of my h2o needs.What about people who had to work in the rain? What about 
sludge that is collected from water treatment plants after a rain. Would not 
this sludge contain higher radiation as it did in places like scotland? Did it 
not drop into reservoirs where we will eventually be drinking tapwater that is 
made of rainwater? I just feel that discarding the highest measurement, the one 
found in rainwater to be flip. I hope someone knowledgeable responds to some of 
these questions.</p>

<p>In light of the announcement on the log page entitled &quot;Response to 
some misleading claims about our measurements&quot;, could someone from the 
team comment on the points here?</p>

<p>This is a very good point. My area has a lake/reservoir system that was 
mostly recarged by the recent heavy rains. I was lulled into a faulse sense of 
security by the numbers reported here. Bottom line, depending on where your 
water comes from, you could be getting water that is closer to the rain water 
than the drinking water figures here.</p> 
<p>Taking one sample from one location can be very misleading.</p> <br>
