<h2>Passive water harvesting</h2> <strong>Question:</strong> 
<p>What is &quot;passive water harvesting&quot;? I have been collecting 
rainwater from my roof for years in large barrels, so I understand &quot;water 
harvesting&quot;, but I'm not sure what is meant by &quot;passive&quot; water 
harvesting.</p> <strong>Answer:</strong> 
<p>Passive water harvesting, like passive solar energy utilization, tends to 
be a system of water harvesting requiring little energy input and little effort 
on the part of the gardener after the system is constructed.</p> 
<p>This method of water harvesting doesn't involve collection barrels and 
should have less need for screening and chemicals to prevent mosquitoes and 
other pests breeding in the harvested water. Water from rooftops and other 
hardscape areas of the landscape are directed into storage in the soil. This 
water is applied to trees needing deep irrigation and to areas needing leaching 
to remove salts that accumulated after application of poor quality water. There 
is no need for pumping or transporting the water from the storage site to the 
point of utilization. It is utilized at the storage site.</p> 
<p>Water from the rooftop and other areas is directed by a system of swales 
(broad shallow ditches) to the area where it will be utilized. The soil is then 
distributed across that area and seeps into the soil. Water on the surface may 
evaporate, but the deeper water will be utilized by trees and other deeply 
rooted plants in the area.</p> 
<p>The system of swales may be a shallow, almost unnoticeable, linear 
depression in a lawn area, or it may be a mock arroyo lined with plastic and 
filled with cobbles and boulders to become a distinctive element in the 
landscape. The arroyo may be landscaped with appropriate plants within this 
arroyo or plants may line its margin. The main purpose is to direct the water 
from near the house to a point of usage away from the foundation and among 
plants needing deeper irrigation. Passive water harvesting may not provide all 
the irrigation needed by trees in the landscape, but will reduce the need for 
purchased or pumped water, reducing costs for maintaining the trees. An 
interesting fact, long apparent to gardeners, is that rain water is better for 
plants than tap water. There is no reason to waste rainwater by allowing it to 
runoff. It is also a waste to allow rainwater to seep deeply into soil with 
shallow rooted plants. It is best used with the deeper rooted plants in the 
landscape.</p> 
<p>Passive water harvesting does compete with &quot;active water 
harvesting&quot; in which water is collected in barrels to be distributed by 
pumping or gravity drainage at a later date. Gardeners should determine which 
system is most appropriate for their landscape. If the vegetable or flower 
garden is the place most in need of harvested rain water, then the active water 
harvesting system will be more appropriate. Other gardeners will find that 
passive water harvesting is most appropriate for them and provides an 
opportunity for creating an interesting element in the landscape. Either system 
allows gardeners to make best use of the (usually) sparse rainfall of the 
Southwestern U.S.</p>
