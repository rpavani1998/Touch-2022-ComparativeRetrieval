<h1>Big Berkey Water Filters</h1>  For the Love of Clean Water 
<h2>Archive for the &lsquo;Uncategorized&rsquo; Category</h2> 
<h3>Better than Plain Water? Washing Away the Beverage Marketing Hype</h3> 
Tuesday, April 3rd, 2012 
<p>Here at Big Berkey Water Filters, we think water should be your beverage of 
choice most of the time. We explained why SmartWater, and bottled water in 
general, isn&rsquo;t all that smart. We&rsquo;ve also questioned energy drinks 
and explained whydrinking soda more than very occasionally is a bad idea too. 
But what about other beverages touted as healthy or all natural, some of which 
even use the word &ldquo;water&rdquo; in their label?</p> 
<h3><strong>Vitamin Water</strong></h3> 
<p>Essentially synthetic vitamins, sugar, and artificial colors and flavors 
dissolved in water, the nutritional label does make Vitamin Water seem like a 
better choice than soda. But is it?</p> 
<p>Emily Playscello of Fit Sugar did the math. The nutritional claims on the 
Vitamin Water label are based on serving size. Since most people probably drink 
the whole 2.5-serving bottle at once, that calculation is more important. 
&ldquo;[O]ne bottle of Vitamin Water contains 125 calories and 33 grams of 
sugar. (Remind me again why they try to call this a form of 
&ldquo;water&rdquo;?) That&rsquo;s more calories and sugar than a 12 ounce 
serving of Coke . . . Now, Coke contains high fructose corn syrup and is not 
fortified, but nutritionally, you&rsquo;re still getting sugar and calories 
from both drinks.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3><strong>Coconut Water</strong></h3> 
<p>Often advertised as an all-natural, low sugar alternative to sports drinks 
with healing properties far beyond exercise recovery, some nutritionists warn 
that coconut water isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. Coconut water 
is the liquid found in a young coconut and is often served fresh in the coconut 
in tropical climates. For those of us in more temperate locales, the coconut 
water is harvested, pasteurized, bottled, and shipped.<strong></strong></p> 
<p>As far as calories and sugar goes, coconut water is a better choice than 
soda&nbsp;or other high sugar beverages&nbsp;(64.5 calories/15 g sugar per 12 
ounce serving compared to 110 cal/30 g sugar for soda). But since it can be an 
acquired taste, many beverage makers blend it with juice, which naturally 
increases the sugar and calorie content.&nbsp;Reporters Katherine Hobson and 
Angela Haupt compared plain coconut water by Zico with Gatorade forUSNews &amp; 
World Report:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Gatorade:</strong> 6.25 calories, 1.75 grams sugar, 3.75 mg 
potassium, 13.75 mg sodium</p> 
<p>(plain) <strong>Zico:</strong> 5.45 calories, 1.3 grams sugar, 61 mg 
potassium, 5.45 mg sodium</p> </blockquote> 
<p>From a sugar and calories perspective, Zico seems to be a slightly better 
choice, but, say Hobson and Haupt, if you are rehydrating from exercise, you 
actually want the sodium in Gatorade more than the potassium in coconut water.
</p> 
<p>Zico doesn&rsquo;t offer coconut water/juice blends. Their flavored 
varieties are just that: flavored. So let&rsquo;s look at a competitor&rsquo;s 
offering:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple: </strong>7.06 
calories,&nbsp;1.9 grams sugar,&nbsp;61 mg potassium,&nbsp;3.6 mg sodium.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>If you drink the entire 17 ounce bottle of Vita Coco, that&rsquo;s 120 
calories, slightly more than the same-size serving of Gatorade.</p> 
<h3><strong>Sports Drinks</strong></h3> 
<p>Powerade, Gatorade, and sports recovery drink relatives have poured 
significant research funds into developing that most palatable beverage that 
delivers the quickest electrolyte replenishment along with hydration.</p> 
<p>The biggest problem with sports drinks is that most people don&rsquo;t need 
them; they don&rsquo;t exercise hard enough to need to electrolyte 
replenishment or even burn enough calories to offset the beverage. Unless you 
are exercising hard for more than 90 minutes, sports drinks do no better than 
water in most hydration studies.</p> 
<p>Sports beverages are still basically processed sugar, salts, artificial 
flavor, and color. If you do need sugar/electrolyte boost and those ingredients 
don&rsquo;t sit well with you, a handful of salted pretzels with your water 
before or after exercise also provides easily digestible carbohydrates and 
sodium.</p> 
<h3><strong>Drink Water</strong></h3> 
<p>Your Berkey filtered water continues to be the winner for hydration and 
health. If you like your filtered water flavored, try adding a squeeze of 
lemon, a slice of fresh ginger, a few peppermint leaves, or even an herbal tea 
bag (yes, it works with cold water).&nbsp; Taking yourSport Berkey or other 
water bottle in the morning before you head out is a good way to both; keep 
drinking water, and staying away from unhealthy sports drinks and other sugary 
beverages.</p>

<h3>America&rsquo;s Aging Sewer System Threatens Beachgoers and Swimmers</h3> 
Tuesday, March 27th, 2012 
<p>Your Berkey water filter has been shown to effectively purify even 
untreated water. But unfortunately, your water filter can&rsquo;t protect you 
from water contamination if you swim in it.</p> 
<p>Water Quality State and county authorities issued 24,091 beach closing and 
advisory days in 2010 due to pollution, primarily from sewage and animal waste, 
which could expose swimmers to a host of waterborne illnesses.</p> 
<h2>Sewage Contamination From Cities and Farms</h2> 
<p>According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the advocacy 
organization that calculated the beach-closing statistic, pollution from leaky 
sewer pipes or overflows during heavy rains are a primary source of human 
sewage pollution in waterways.</p> 
<p>In many urban areas, rain runoff from roofs and roads is directed into the 
same pipes that carry household sewage to the local water treatment plant. 
During very heavy storms, the system can be overwhelmed and rainwater and 
untreated sewage simply overflows into local waterways. In more rural areas, 
poorly contained animal agriculture operations allow rain to wash waste into 
waterways.</p> 
<h2>Surfers and Swimmers Get Sick from Contaminated Beach Water</h2> 
<p>The latest issue of Surfer magazine reports: &ldquo;Most official county 
advisories warn to avoid contact with the water for 72 hours after a heavy 
rain, a three-day buffer to allow the collective runoff to thin to healthy 
levels.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Many surfers don&rsquo;t wait that long, either because they don&rsquo;t 
realize they should or they think they tougher than the bacteria in the water. 
&ldquo;Surfers sometimes believe that they are immune to ocean-related illness, 
because they have been surfing that same spot for years, or that the water 
quality is not as bad as it is hyped up to be,&rdquo; explains Paloma Aguirre, 
spokesperson for the San Diego-based environmental organizationWiLDCOAST.</p> 
<h2>Even Sandcastles Can Harbor Beach Bacteria</h2> 
<p>According to NRDC, it&rsquo;s not just surfers who are at risk. Swimmers 
and other beach-goers, especially pregnant women, children, the elderly and 
those with a weakened immune system need to heed warnings and stay out of the 
water when bacteria levels rise. Not only that, minimizing exposure to beach 
sand after an advisory is issued may be just as important.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Bacteria concentrate in sand as water rises and recedes with the 
tides, leaving both the wet sand and the dry sand just beyond it more heavily 
contaminated than the water. Because of this, it is most important to keep 
beach sand out of the mouths of toddlers. Keeping your hands out of it or 
washing them after playing in the sand is also a good idea,&rdquo; explains the
NRDC website.</p> 
<h2>Pollution Illnesses on The Rise</h2> 
<p>Pollution at U.S. beaches exposes swimmers to a range of waterborne 
illnesses and may cause stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, ear, nose and throat 
problems, dysentery, hepatitis, respiratory ailments, neurological disorders 
and other serious health problems.</p> 
<p>It is hard to determine the number of gastroenteritis cases or other 
diseases caused by swimming in polluted water. There is no national reporting 
system in the United States to help epidemiologists track national trends, but 
the Centers for Disease Control estimate that illness from contaminated beach 
water is on the rise. One study conducted by the agency concluded that 10 
percent of Great Lakes beachgoers get sick after swimming.</p> 
<h2>Fixing Sewers and Protecting the Public from Pollution</h2> 
<p>RDC and other public health advocates are calling for a variety of reforms 
that include increased funding for sewer treatment plant upgrades and sewage 
system repair. The public could also be better protected by improving water 
quality testing speed, accuracy, and public notification systems.</p>

<h3>6 Unexpected Reasons To Drink Less Soda</h3> Monday, March 19th, 2012 
<p>A few posts ago, we gave you 6 Reasons to Drink More Water. Now we have one 
more: It&rsquo;s so much better for you than drinking soda.</p> 
<p>We all know that drinking too much soda is bad for your teeth and 
waistline, but researchers have uncovered all sorts of other scary health 
effects of drinking Coca Cola, Mountain Dew, and their many soft drink 
relatives.</p> 
<h2>Health Reasons to Skip the Soda (and Just Drink Water)</h2> 
<p>While Coca Cola and Pepsi Co both recently agreed to reformulate their 
caramel coloring to reduce a carcinogenic ingredient banned in California, 
there are many other scary reasons to cut back.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Soda Drinkers Accumulate Fat in Dangerous, Hard-to-Detect Places
</strong></p> 
<p>Some of the health effects correlated with soda consumption may actually be 
due to the likelihood that calories from these sugared drinks displace 
healthier beverages that would have provided important nutrients or that heavy 
soda drinkers have a poor diet overall. However, a recent Danish study connects 
non-diet soda consumption to dangerous fat accumulation in&nbsp;the liver and 
skeleton even when non-soda drinkers consumed the same calories.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Researchers asked participants to drink either regular soda, milk 
containing the same amount of calories as regular soda, diet cola, or water 
every day for six months. The results? Total fat mass remained the same across 
all beverage-consuming groups, but regular-soda drinkers experienced dramatic 
increases in harmful hidden fats, including liver fat and skeletal fat,&rdquo;
The Daily Times reports.</p> 
<p><strong>2. BPA in Soda Can Liners Mimic Hormones</strong></p> 
<p>In February 2012, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported that it found the 
plastic softenerbisphenol-a in 96% of the cans of soda it tested. Both the 
beverage companies and Health Canada assured the public that the levels of BPA 
exposure from soda is not dangerous. However, people are exposed to BPA from 
hundreds of possible sources.</p> 
<p>Dr. Frederick vom Saal, a biologist at the University of Missouri at 
Columbia known for discovering health problems linked to exposure to common 
chemicals in everyday products told the Globe and Mail: &ldquo;there is also a 
growing body of scientific literature, based on animal experiments, that has 
found harmful effects due to BPA at concentrations up to 1,000 times below 
Health Canada&rsquo;s safety limit. These conditions include such hormonally 
linked illnesses as breast cancer, and Dr. vom Saal called the 
government&rsquo;s assurances of no harm &lsquo;simple-minded.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>3. Flame-retardants In Citrus-Flavored Soft-Drinks And Sports-Drinks
</strong></p> 
<p>Soda companies&rsquo; use brominated vegetable oil (BVO) to keep 
ingredients from separating in approximately 10 percent of sodas including 
Mountain Dew and other citrus flavored soft drinks. BVO is patented as a flame 
retardant in Japan and banned in food products in Europe.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;After a few extreme soda binges &mdash; not too far from what many 
[video] gamers regularly consume &ndash; a few patients have needed medical 
attention for skin lesions, memory loss and nerve disorders, all symptoms of 
overexposure to bromine,&rdquo; according to a recent article inEnvironmental 
News.</p> 
<p><strong>4. Corn-syrup from Sweetened Beverages Comes from Genetically 
Modified Corn</strong></p> 
<p>More than 85% of the corn grown in the United States is genetically 
modified (gmo). And most of that goes into processed foods and animal feed. 
According toThe Center for Food Safety, &ldquo;[h]uman health effects can 
include higher risks of toxicity, allergenicity, antibiotic resistance, 
immune-suppression and cancer.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Environmental Reasons to Pass on Pop (and Just Drink Water)</h2> 
<p><strong>5. Artificial Sweeteners in Soda End Up In Drinking Water</strong>
</p> 
<p>In a 2009 study published in Environmental Science &amp; Technology 
researchers found that sweeteners in the soda we are drinking are not being 
filtered out by sewerage treatment plants are circulating back around in our 
drinking water again.</p> 
<p><strong>6. Soda Has a Big Water Footprint</strong></p> 
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal article, it takes as much as 132 gallons 
of water to make a 2-liter bottle of soda. Some of that water is used in 
farming the ingredients and some is used in the manufacture and bottling. All 
that water has to come from somewhere. Farmers near Mehdiganj in northern India
blame the local Coca Cola bottling plant for a 6-meter drop in the water table 
since 2000 when the plant opened.</p> 
<h2>Bonus, Totally Unsurprising Reason to Choose Water Over Soda</h2> 
<p>1. Filtered Water Tastes Great and Is Much Cheaper than Soda</p> 
<p>The first 6000 gallons filtered through your Berkey water filter costs less 
than $0.02. Once you&rsquo;ve replaced the filter in the same durable housing, 
your per gallon cost even less. That compares to more than$4 per gallon for soda
 by the can.</p>

<h3>America&rsquo;s Top Snowboarders Want You To Drink Water</h3> Monday, 
January 9th, 2012 
<p>Energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become 
popular among fans of snowboarding in the United States, with drink companies 
advertising at events and sponsoring athletes. After professional snowboarders 
Bryan Fox and Austin Smith were approached by a company about promoting their 
product, the duo decided to do something about their concerns that the added 
sugar, stimulants and other ingredients in those drinks weren&rsquo;t just a 
bad substitute for water but might actually be dangerous.</p> 
<h2>Drink Water Gives Voice to Energy Drink Wary Snowboarders</h2> 
<p>Fox and Smith began sporting their own &ldquo;drink water&rdquo; logo on 
their boards and apparel. Before long, they found themselves leading a 
campaign. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been crazy to see the overwhelming support since we 
started this, that we&rsquo;re not the only ones,&rdquo; Smith told theNew York 
Times.</p> 
<p>The Drink Water campaign now sells t-shirts, stickers and hoodies with the 
following explanation: &ldquo;Drink Water is a friendly reminder to drink 
water.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you love snowboarding or some other healthy activity that defines 
many decisions in your life, you are likely a choice target-consumer for 
companies that sell &lsquo;energy drinks.&rsquo; Maybe you, like us, started to 
feel uncomfortable about how effective these companies have become at 
encouraging young people to consume their product: beverages of caffeine, 
sodium, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and even some mystery chemicals about 
which little is known.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Energy Drinks Marketed to Kids</h2> 
<p>Fox and Smith are not the only ones raising concerns about energy drinks. 
Parents and doctors around the country have raised the alarm about the host of 
sugary drinks marketed to kids that contribute to obesity, diabetes, even 
ailments like kidney stones, once unheard of in kids. According to 
SugaryDrinkFacts.org, &ldquo;from 2008 to 2010 ad exposure for regular soda 
doubled for children and teens, and energy drink exposure increased by 20 to 
50%.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The New York Times last year reported on an emerging trend of kidney stones 
showing up in in kindergarteners, in part because they were drinking 
high-sodium sports drinks instead of water. Sports drinks were designed to 
replenish nutrients lost by top athletes during hard exercise, but they are now 
marketed in lunch-box size packages and found as an alternative to soda in 
school vending machines.</p> 
<p>The big difference between sodas or sports drinks and the kind of energy 
drinks that inspired the Drink Water campaign is that, by labeling energy 
drinks as dietary supplements instead of food, companies avoid a host of Food 
&amp; Drug Administration regulations about truth in advertising. The companies 
are not required to substantiate the claims on its packaging.</p> 
<h2>Drink Water Campaign Touches a Nerve</h2> 
<p>SugaryDrinkFacts.org reports that 5 Hour Energy ranked among the top 3 
beverages most advertised to kids and the #1 most advertised to teens. While 
energy drinks are considered safe in reasonable quantities by the generally 
healthy adult population, Fox and Smith are hearing anecdotal evidence that 
overdoses are more and more common.On their blog they recount a conversation 
with a fellow postal customer after explaining their campaign:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Lady: Oh my God, thank God! I work at the county Poison Control 
Center, and for years, when we got calls on caffeine overdoses, we never asked 
a follow up question for specifics. Now, we have a separate option for 
&ldquo;Energy Drink Overdoses.&rdquo; I just had a mom call in last week, and 
her 8 year old had drunk a 6 pack of *******. She called because the kid was 
light headed, was sick to his stomach and his heart was racing, and you know 
what I told her? Give him a lots of water to flush out his system. We get calls 
every week on this stuff. Crazy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The campaign donates 10 percent of their profits to Water.org, a nonprofit 
co-founded by the actor Matt Damon that provides clean water and sanitation in 
Africa, southern Asia and Central America.(BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com also 
supports and donates to Water.Org)</p>

<h3>Buying Bottled Water - Do You Know What You&rsquo;re Getting?</h3> 
Thursday, October 27th, 2011 
<p>When reaching out for a bottle of water in a supermarket you expect to get 
a safe, high value drink that replenishes your bodily fluids and supplies the 
organism with valuable minerals. But is this always the case? The truth may 
surprise you.</p> 
<p>Nowadays, consumers have become more and more aware of their rights and 
have requested manufacturers to provide information that enable them to make 
good choices. Surprisingly, the bottled water industry finds this already 
established trend difficult to accept and follow.</p> 
<p>As bottled water can cost up to 1,900 times more than tap water, is it too 
much too expect to be well-informed on the product? What is the water&rsquo;s 
origin? Has it been purified? If so, what techniques have been used in this 
process? Has it been tested for quality? Have the tests found any contaminants? 
In many cases this basic information is difficult to find on the label or on 
the producer&rsquo;s website.</p> 
<h2><strong>EWG&rsquo;s Bottled Water Study</strong></h2> 
<p>Environmental Working Group (EWG) carries out an annual survey on the level 
of transparency of information among the bottled water brands in the United 
States. In 2011 the group has reviewed 173 bottled water products and compared 
the results with those from the previous year.</p> 
<p>It has turned out, that nine of the best-selling brands, including Pepsi, 
Coca-Cola and Nestle, do not answer at least one of the above questions. The 
survey results have revealed that 18% of the products do not provide the 
location of water source, 32% of brands do not disclose any information on the 
treatment or quality of water, and 13% of product are supported by &lsquo;water 
quality reports&rsquo; that lack actual testing results.</p> 
<p>Comparing the results with previous year findings, very slow progress was 
noticed. Over 50% of the surveyed brands did not improve, or even worse, 
included less information than in 2010. Only 39 brands scored better in 
information transparency in 2011 versus 2010. Even the best scored brads were 
not faultless. Believe it or not, some of them provided out dated water tests 
from 2008!</p> 
<h2>Bottled Water Vs Tap Water</h2> 
<p>It may be a surprise, but most companies producing bottled water source it 
from municipal tap (Food and Water Watch data). Moreover, the plastic material 
used for making bottles may incorporate chemical substances like BPA (Bisphenol 
A) that can leach into drinking water.</p> 
<p>According to federal regulations bottled water is not much safer than tap 
water, as the chemical pollution standards are almost the same. As so many 
bottled water producers keep information on water quality to themselves, it is 
possible that most of the time you are paying for bottled tap water without 
even knowing it.</p> 
<p>In addition to water quality arguments, there are serious environmental 
reasons for giving up bottled water. Between 2004 and 2009 the consumption of 
bottled water in the United States increased by 24%. It is estimated that every 
27 hours U.S. citizens drink enough bottled water to circle the equator with 
empty bottles and each year more than 4 million of plastic containers go to the 
landfill nationwide. These are not good statistics!</p> 
<p>Producing bottled water also has a high carbon footprint price &ndash; it 
takes 20,000 times more energy to produce bottled water than the same amount of 
tap water. In the United States, the production and transportation of bottled 
water is responsible for the level of CO2 emission comparable to that produced 
by two million cars.</p> 
<h2>Drink Filtered Tap Water</h2> 
<p>What are EWG&rsquo;s recommendations then? Their main call is: Drink 
Filtered Tap Water.</p> 
<p>A good quality domestic filter system lasts over 10 years. It can save you 
money and allow you to do your part in contributing to a cleaner environment. 
There is a wide variety of water filter systems that can be used indoors, 
outdoors or even during travelling. Good quality systems successfully remove 
bacteria, chlorine, organic solvents, VOCs, lead, mercury, nitrates and 
nitrites as well as other harmful substances. We believe theberkey water filter 
provides the highest quality filtration for the lowest initial and ongoing 
maintenance costs. There is also a different berkey water filter model 
available to accommodate every family size. Here&rsquo;s acomparison of berkey 
and other top consumer water filters on the market. Regardless of what model or 
supplier you choose, they should provide you with detailed system 
specifications and ongoing maintenance costs estimates, so you will know 
exactly what you will be paying for.</p>

<h3>Wise Food Survival Kits Back in Stock!</h3> Monday, October 24th, 2011 
<p>After being out of stock for nearly 5 months, the very popular Wise Food 
survival kits are now again available. Last March, when the Japan earthquake 
impacted emergency preparedness supplies across the US, these survival kits 
sold out within days and resulted in a 5 month backlog of orders. Now, the 
manufacturer has not only caught up on these back orders, but they have also 
ramped up&nbsp;production&nbsp;operations and increased inventory reserves to 
better handle the fervent demand that&nbsp;typically&nbsp;follows 
the&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;of a natural&nbsp;disaster.<em>Note: We &nbsp;happen 
to be seeing this currently with the Turkey earthquake and flooding in Thailand
</em>.</p> 
<p>If you do not have any emergency preparedness items for you or your family,

<h3>Uranium Mine Contaminating Groundwater of Jefferson County, Colorado</h3> 
Thursday, April 22nd, 2010 
<p>The Denver Post has recently reported that an abandoned uranium mine 
located in Jefferson County, Colorado is contaminating both surrounding 
groundwater and a creek that serves the Denver&rsquo;s Ralston Water Reservoir. 
Beneath the Schwartzwalder Mine, Uranium concentrations were found to exceed 
human health standards by more than 1000 times! Fortunately, the Ralston 
Reservoir is on temporary leave from serving Denver&rsquo;s drinking water 
system, but local residents who are on wells in Jefferson County are rightfully 
nervous about this new development. However, it&rsquo;s not such a new 
development.</p> 
<p>Colorado regulators were aware of this contamination at least as early as 
July 2009, with uranium seepage likely underway for a considerable time 
beforehand, yet neither local residents nor the Denver water authority was 
notified of the problem. Negotiations with the owner for the clean-up of the 
mine and contaminated areas have been underway for some time, but a resolution 
has yet to be reached.&nbsp; In the meantime, Uranium continues to seep into 
the surrounding environment.</p>

<h3>Home Water Filters Take The Worry Away</h3> Thursday, February 4th, 2010 
<p>Every time you turn on the tap at home, chances are you find yourself 
wondering just what is in your water. Unsavory chemicals like chlorine, 
unwanted additives like fluoride, and a host of microscopic bacteria can seep 
into every glass. It&rsquo;s become an all to often event to read frightening 
headlines about just what has been found in the public water supply.</p> 
<p>When it&rsquo;s time to enjoy peace of mind, home water filters can 
deliver. When the right system is selected, you will enjoy cleaner, safer water 
without having to spend a fortune in the process.</p> 
<p>The Berkey home water filter system is favored from the British Royal house 
to Peace Corp camps around the world for very good reasons. Our water filters 
remove the things in your water that you don&rsquo;t want without stripping out 
the vital minerals your body needs.</p> 
<p>The gravity water filters we offer are designed to get rid of a number of 
major concerns in public drinking water. They are highly effective at removing 
such things as cysts, parasites, and harmful pathogens (to 99.99999%), while 
also removing many unwanted chemicals and contaminants to undetectable levels. 
Berkey water filter systems also significantly reduce the fluoride and arsenic 
levels in your water via the PF line of filters.</p> 
<p>When the right home water filter system is used, you can be assured of 
several things every time you pour a glass of water for a family member. These 
include:</p> 
<p><strong>Enjoying better tasting water</strong> &ndash; Chlorine and other 
additives placed into public water supplies can give water a funny flavor that 
bothers many. When home water filters are used to get rid of the chemicals, the 
only taste left behind is pure, clean water. In addition to making drinks taste 
better, the removal of chemicals is also fantastic for the flavors of dishes 
cooked with water in the mix.</p> 
<p><strong>Gaining peace of mind</strong> &ndash; There is something very 
comforting about knowing an effective home water filter system is on the job. 
With harmful bacteria found even in municipal drinking water systems, you can 
never be too safe. The right water filters will remove any worries and concerns 
associated with grabbing water straight out of your tap.</p> 
<p><strong>Getting your money&rsquo;s worth</strong> &ndash; Some home water 
filters cost a small fortune to put into operation. The Berkey system does not. 
Our water costs about 1.7 cents a gallon. Plus, the Berkey home water filter 
system does not depend on electricity to function and it is fully portable. 
This means it can be counted on to deliver safe, clean water even during power 
outages. It can also be taken on the road during camping trips and more.</p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are on a well or have city water, 
turning on the tap can sometimes be a crap-shoot. If you&rsquo;re ready to stop 
worrying about what is in your water and start enjoying a cleaner taste, then 
picking the right home water filter system is a great investment. Berkey water 
delivers the performance you&rsquo;re after, at the prices you can afford.</p>
