 Scientifically, 
testimonials are considered as hearsay and are sometimes rejected as 
inadmissible evidence of benefits of an agent for health. However, when the 
number of testimonials of an effect becomes significant, it is unlikely that 
the events have occurred by chance alone. Water ionizers have a track record of 
over 30 years and millions of units sold. Many people have reported amazing 
results. Testimonials are given by people who wish to share their experiences 
and are solely for information purposes. All information contained herein is

<p> <strong>My hyptertension symptoms are gone - 2012</strong> <br>
</p>
<p><strong><i>In English</i>:</strong></p> 
<p>I've suffered from hypertension for 15 years. Even with medication to 
control my symptoms, I experienced strong headaches, fluid retention, and 
intense pain in my heals. When I started drinking alkaline water, after only 
three weeks I started to feel more healthy, to the point that - without 
consulting my doctor - I stopped using my hypertension medicine. Now I've spent 
two months drinking this wonderful water and my blood pressure stays without 
variation at 120/80. It is amazing. The pain has also gone away. It doesn't 
hurt to bend over or jog. I have a lot more energy. And now my mother is also 
feeling better. I recommend this water, it is really the water of life.</p> 
<p><strong><i>En Espa&ntilde;ol</i>:</strong></p> 
<p>Yo padecia de hipertension hace 15 aa'os y aun con medicamento de control 
continuaba con los dolores de caeza ademas tenia retencion de liquidos. Tambien 
fuertes dolores de talones..pero cuando empece abeber el agua alcalina tan solo 
a las 3 semanas comence a sentirme mas saludable al punto que sin consultar al 
medico suspendi el medicamento de la hipertencion...Ahora han pasado 2 meses de 
estar tomando esta maravillosa agua y creanme que estoy con la presion normal 
cada 2 dias me voy al control y sigue sin varioar 120/80 es asombroso ademas se 
fueron los dolores e hinchazoznes de los talones, tambien ya no me asficxo al 
agacharme y al trotar me levantyo en las maa'anas con mucha mayor energia...Y 
ahora mi madre tambien esta sintiendose mejor de sus enfermedades yo les 
recomiendo esta agua es realmente el agua de la vida.</p>

<strong>My Skin Looks Younger - 2012</strong> 
<p>I love my ionizer. My bladder condition is slowly improving. I have had 
cystitis and a lot of pain for months. I love the alkaline water. The thing 
that I have really noticed is my skin on my face and particularly my neck. I am 
55 and have always been told that I look young for my age but I have felt 
self-conscious about my neck in the past few years that started to show age. 
Since I started drinking the alkaline water the signs of aging on my neck are 
almost gone in only 3-4 weeks! This is amazing considering I smoked for 33 
years and stopped in Sept. 2010...</p>

<strong>I feel good most of the time 
while being told that I shouldn&#146;t. - November 3, 2011</strong> 
<p>(Testimonal taken by phone by Carol Rutherford.)</p> 
<p>Douglas and his wife, Lorraine bought an Athena Ionizer July 2011.</p> They 
are very pleased with the results they are receiving from drinking the water 
and Douglas says &#147;the water tastes GREAT! Tastes like water should.&#148;
<p></p> 
<p>His wife used to find it difficult drinking the recommended amount of water 
each day. Since they bought the ionizer she now finds it easy to drink enough!
</p> 
<p>After using the machine for only days they were deprived of the water 
because they were fixing a plumbing problem. They found the tap water 
&#147;tasted awful&#148; after having the purified, ionized water and their son 
said that even his coffee tasted awful in comparison.</p> 
<p>Physical changes they have experienced since they have been drinking the 
water:</p> 
<p>His wife suffers from spastic bowel. For the last 5 or 6 years she has been 
in &#147;agony&#148; due to this health problem and has been taking pain 
killers. After only 3 weeks of drinking the water she felt so much better that 
she stopped taking the pain killers. After 6 weeks her symptoms were gone.</p> 
<p>Douglas has recently gone through radiation treatment for cancer. He was 
told before the treatment by the medical staff what kind of side effects to 
expect during his treatment. He found that his experience of the radiation 
treatment was &#147;greatly reduced from reports of what to expect.&#148; from 
what was described to him by the medical staff and what he heard from others 
who had undergone the same type of treatment. He says that while 
&#147;it&#146;s hard to prove a result of something that didn&#146;t 
happen&#148; he credits the water as being a major factor in his easy recovery.
</p> 
<p>He reported &#147;I feel good most of the time while being told that I 
shouldn&#146;t.&#148;</p> 
<p>They have recommended the ionized water to many of their friends. They 
supplied a friend with the water to drink to see if she might experience any 
relief from her kidney problems. Her backpain ceased after drinking the water 
for only one month and one of her kidneys is now functioning at a much higher 
level than before.</p>
<p>Douglas soaks his feet in the alkaline water. He says &#147;It feels great 
and the dead skin sloughs right off.&#148;</p> 
<p>He drinks two litres of the alkalized water a day and exclaims &#147;I 
swear by this water, it&#146;s tremendous.&#148;</p> 
<p>Douglas Dewar</p>

<strong>I have been amazed at the results I have seen in my skin - 
2011</strong> </p>
<p>I am a seventy-eight year old male. I have been drinking the ionized water 
for six weeks. I have been amazed at the results I have seen in my skin. I have 
washed my face and arms with the acid water twice a day.&nbsp; My skin had been 
badly damaged by years of construction work in the southeast and southwest sun. 
I now have smoother skin with more glow. I especially noticed this when someone 
told me that I looked so much younger and my skin was glowing. I recommend the 
Athena water ionizer.</p>

<strong>My Mom's legs cramps have 
disappeared - 2011</strong> 
<p>We just came back from camping in our trailer and we took our Melody 
Ionizer with us. It was easy to pack and we installed it just the same as at 
home. It was wonderful having the purified water on tap. For years we always 
hauled bottled water with us in the trailer and this was much better than 
carrying all that extra weight of containers of water.</p> 
<p>It was also great not having to worry about running out of drinking water. 
I am so glad we bought this water system. It makes wonderful water! By the way, 
my Mom's legs cramps have disappeared since drinking ionized water. She stopped 
drinking it for a few days and the cramps came back with elegance. She 
increased her calcium and magnesium intake but that had very little effect. 
Once she got back on the alkaline water the leg cramps disappeared! What a 
great double blind study we created.</p>

<strong>Knee Pain Gone, More Energy - 2011</strong> <br>

<p>(Testimonial taken by Minucha Colburn, water consultant)</p> 
<p>Dorota Duszcyk is very happy with her Delphi ionizer. She talked about how 
the pain in her knees is gone since drinking alkaline water, her energy level 
is much better. Her husband sleeps lots better, she couldn&#146;t say enough 
good things about the Delphi.</p> 
<p>She will recommend friends to buy the Delphi from us.</p> <br>
<strong>
Alkaline Water: A No-Brainer - 2011</strong> 
<p>We have not come close to reaching the &quot;tipping point&quot; on this 
concept. One of the main reasons is that the normal place one might ask about 
such an investment in one's health would be one's doctor. Because the 
&quot;controlled studies&quot; are &quot;not in&quot; (and even not even 
contemplated) the good doctor will hedge his bets and say at best &quot;it can 
do no harm&quot; or get a bit frustrated and answer flippantly in some manner. 
To drink clear alkaline water (that has not had chemicals added to it to make 
it alkaline) is a no brainer!! One doesn't need to go to medical school to 
appreciate what drinking &quot;good spring well water&quot; tastes like....you 
just need to have been to a well (a good country lad like myself knows 
that)...however most medical students have never drank &quot;good spring well 
water&quot; and so are unlikely to appreciate that essentials like water and 
air do not normally taste like sh*t. The added physical improvement will be 
what the pharmaceutical empires label &quot;anecdotal&quot;...a word used by 
physicians who invariably do not listen to their patients!!!(Sir William 
Osler-a canadian said &quot;listen to your patients carefully..they will tell 
you what is wrong with themselves....and if you listen a little longer they 
will tell you how to treat it.&quot; 19th century wisdom and an essential piece 
of advise for all doctors and more necessary today than back then...) Roll on 
the tipping point on this one...and yes you will be getting in on the ground 
floor.</p>

<strong>Some All-Time Best Testimonials</strong><br>

<br> <strong>My Esophagus Pain and Toe fungus are GONE!</strong>
<p> I will start by saying I was a little skeptical about the concept of water 
ionization, but given a 60 day money back guarantee what could I lose. I 
figured if it did half of what it claims it will be a good thing.</p>
<p>To my surprise it exceeded my expectations, it is not going back. In four 
day's a problem with my esophagus and a pain in my side disappeared, I have had 
these problems for over a year, wow!!!!</p>
<p>I could eat a meal without drinking a large pitcher of water and it felt 
like a alka selzer tablet dissolving in my side. Not to mention the toe fungus 
which I have had for years is starting to clear up after soaking in the acid 
water, this in two months of using this water again WOW!!!!.</p>
<p>I look forward to see the benefits in the long term !! I could go on and on 
but I will stop for now other than to say the customer service is top notch.<br>

<strong>&quot;UNBELIEVABLE&quot; BENEFITS</strong> 
<p>....I wish I had the time to share with you in writing what I did in words 
with you on the phone the other day about the exciting and the at first 
unbelievable benefits I have experience from ionized water and especially from 
the Jupiter &quot;Melody&quot; water ionizer.</p> 
<p>I have never had anything affect me in such a dramatic and positive way!!
</p> 
<p>Let me tell you, this is now my life's mission! Not because I am acting on 
some sort of faith that it will help me in the future but because it has helped 
me NOW!</p> 
<p>I have suffered from horrible allergies resulting from nasal polyps (So I 
was told), and had to be on steroids to reduce the inflammation and congestion. 
Within about a year after that I developed High Blood Pressure as a result of 
the steroids, so I was told and as you can imagine I had to have one drug to 
fix one thing then another for a problem for that etc. etc!!</p> 
<p>Talk about great marketing if you're a drug manufacturer!!</p> 
<p>Bottom Line!! I have virtually no more allergies, and what I mean by that 
is I can BREATHE!! Without the medication!! (No waking up in the morning 
hacking and spiting phlegm). My Blood pressure is NORMAL!!</p> 
<p>I forgot to mention my diagnosis of chronic Arthritis last year in my lower 
back in which I became a fan of pain killers (try running a business in that 
constant state) 99% GONE!!</p> 
<p>My daughter who is 7 years of age never drinks water, now she will insist 
on Alkalized water, it is a must for her water bottle when going to school. 
(Our home has experienced less frequencies of the bug which is generally passed 
on from one student to another in schools)</p> 
<p>My wife who was placed on a manic depressant prescription a few years ago 
but due to no insurance we stop getting it, she is experiencing elevated moods!
</p> 
<p>I can go on with the experiences related to me and my friends who I have 
shared this water with but I must get back to work, because now, my life's 
mission is to tell others everyday, ALL DAY!!</p> 
<p>Thank you so much!!</p> Sincerely, Glen Lyles, Orlando Florida<br>

<strong>SAM GRACI, DEVELOPER OF GREENS+</strong> 
<p>...Dear Stan,<br>
<br>
I am a big fan of electron-rich and alkaline water 
made from water ionizers that give water a pH of almost 10. Plants love the 
acidic water. I will be writing about water ionizers in a new book that I am 
just in the midst of writing. I actually call this water, plasma-activated 
micro-ionized water, that has a smaller molecule cluster of 1 to 2 molecules 
versus 10 to 24 in most tap water.</p>
<p>I wish you well as this is a very necessary area and you can make a 
superior contribution to your brothers and sisters well-being.</p>
<p>Fondest best wishes,</p>
<p>Sam Graci -- Sam is the developer of Greens+ and an 
internationally-renowned researcher, formulator, lecturer, consultant, and

<strong>REVIEW OF 
WWW.WATERIONIZER.ORG by Ray Jardine,</strong> 
<p>waterionizer.org--a great resource! This is a really useful site for anyone 
who is thinking about buying a water ionizer, or even just interested in 
alkaline ionized water. The &quot;Articles and Research&quot; section has 
wealth of useful articles from many reputable sources. Any questions you might 
have about alkaline water and its benefits can probably be answered by one of 
the various articles. For more specific questions, I found the staff to be 
highly knowledgeable in their field, and quick to answer my questions.</p>
<p>The Jupiter water ionizer that I purchased from Best Water was everything 
it was advertised as, and more! My overall health, and energy levels have been 
noticeably improved. This water really does work!</p>
<p>Ray Jardine -- renowned rock climber, inventor, author, and originator of 
ultralightweight backpacking.</p> <strong>TASTE &amp; ENERGY</strong> 
<p>&quot;I have recently introduced the water ionizer to my entire family. 
What I found to be wonderful is that all those members who did not feel 
inspired to drink water before have now become water babies.</p> 
<p>My mother, who started the day with a cup of coffee and never thought to 
drink anything during the day, never drank water is now drinking away, can't 
get enough. Our other halves - my husband and father - both go armed to work 
with their 1 liter bottles of ionized water nothing else will do! My father 
jokes that he is glowing like a light bulb!</p> 
<p>I used to drink countless cups of coffee for energy and now drink only the 
ionized water and have found that my skin glows, I have plenty of energy and 
require less sleep. What is great is that non water drinkers are completely 
converted to drinking ionized water - nature's medicine, simply because we know 
it's the best and it tastes great.</p> 
<p>You don't have to wait for an illness before drinking ionized water.&quot;

<p>&quot;The results have blown me away. I have never felt better in my 
life.&quot; Mark Walker, basketball coach, Byron bay Australia</p> <strong>82 
YEAR OLD CHAMPION</strong> 
<p>&quot;I have been drinking Alkaline Ionized Mineral Water...for the past 
two years. I simply love the refreshing taste; all the other benefits of 
increased oxygen content, anti-oxidant abilities, rapid absorption, and its 
higher pH to neutralize excess acidity are all extra-added bonuses. Thank you, 
your water is a blessing for the young and old alike.&quot;</p>

gold (400m individual medley and one kilometer lake swim), two silver (200m 
backstroke and 100m freestyle) and one bronze (200m freestyle).</p> 
<p><strong>ALKALIZING WORKS!</strong></p> 
<p>I've been on the alkaline diet for months now, a bit longer than I've been 
on the water, as I thought there's no point paying for an expensive water 
machine and not doing the diet, too. Otherwise bad diet cancels the good work 
of the water. Getting better at alkaline diet/water each month, have had 
terrific results:<br>
</p>
<li>over 20 lbs lost so far<br>
</li>
<li>blood pressure better than normal after it went up last year for 1st time 
(when I had to stop running first time in my life)<br>
</li>
<li>arthritis from a running injury 20 yrs ago worse every year now all gone 
(running again--yippee!)<br>
</li>
<li>better skin<br>
</li>
<li>deeper, sounder sleep<br>
</li>
<li>more energy (no low energy mid-afternoon)<br>
</li>
<li>calmer (less PMS mood swing)<br>
</li>
<li>brain fog gone<br>
</li>
<li>memory better<br>

<p>Stan, I love the Athena. I started seeing results in less than 3 weeks. My 
skin seems more hydrated and has a healthy sheen to it. My cravings for sweets 
has dropped off considerably. In fact I lost 7 lbs in the short 3 weeks of 
owning the Athena. I still eat the same way (no diet) but I eat way less sweets 
and that probably accounts for the 7 lb loss. I also feel more alert and 
energetic, which is great since I hate doing exercise.</p> 
<p>I even see an improvement in my athletes feet. I have not put any medicine 
on my feet, yet they are clearing up dramatically, so it must be the alkaline 
levels in me.</p>
<p> By the way, I am maintaining a pH above 7.0 since I started drinking this 
water. I have invitro test paper and check every morning.</p>
<p>Joe L., California</p> 
<p>PS: Using the reagent test solution that came with the Athena, I was 
surprised to find out that even after boiling water for cooking and coffee, the 
pH level of the water did not drop one bit.</p> 
<p>PPS: I store the water in the fridge for as long as 5-6 days without losing 
the pH level. That's great.</p> 
<p><strong>A BASIC HEALTH REQUIREMENT</strong></p> 
<p>Getting plenty of freshly ionized, alkalized water daily is, as far as I am 
concerned, a basic health requirement. It was one of those things that once I 
started, I could never stop, or ever consider going back to even the finest 
drinking water commercially available. I have never tasted anything any better 
either. Having an ionizer was one of the most successful health investments I 
have ever made. I am no less excited about ionized water than when I first 
started producing my own from tap water back in May, 2002. Water ionizers 
literally turn ordinary tap water into something quite valuable and quite 
extraordinary.</p> 
<p>Russell Symonds, http://WholeJoy.com </p> 
<p> <strong>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;In December 1986 I was introduced to a water ionizer by a friend of 
mine in Virginia. She told me that the alkaline water from this ionizer would 
lower my blood pressure if I drank 5 cups of it daily. In those days I was 
taking 20mg of Vasotec a day to maintain my blood pressure at around 140/90. 
Vasotec was my third kind of blood pressure pill. The doctor had to change my 
blood pressure pills twice because of different kinds of side effects. I never 
liked the idea of having to take any pills for the rest of my life. Thats what 
the doctor told me when he initially prescribed the blood pressure pills for 
me. My friend didnt know exactly why the blood pressure would come down except 
for the fact that she knew it worked for many people. Trusting her sincerity 
and knowing she was a registered nurse, I bought the ionizer and started to 
drink high pH alkaline water. As I was drinking the alkaline water I monitored 
my blood pressure. I reduced the amount of Vasotec gradually as the blood 
pressure started to come down. After six weeks, I stopped taking Vasotec 
altogether. My blood pressure came down to 130/85 without my pills. In the 
meantime, over a period of two years, I lost about 20 pounds without any 
special diets or exercises. Lately I am noticing that my eyesight is 
improving.&quot;</p>

<p>(This person was on high blood pressure meds 12yrs, experiencing lots of 
side-effects including pain in extremities and bad headaches and now, because 
of this water, NO meds! No pains, either! She was also getting bloated, needed 
meds to clear out the water retention in her body. Her doc can't believe it, 
says no one ever gets off them once on them. She says more--way more--energy 
also. Her mom is elderly, also getting great effects for her health.)</p>

<p><strong>WATER RETENTION IN LEGS and RASH</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I am 78 years old and have started drinking just three glasses of 
high alkaline ionized water per day. I was prescribed 3 blood pressure pills 
(water pills) per day because of water retention in my legs and feet, which 
were always swollen. Just after one week of drinking this Living Water, I am no 
longer taking this medication, I have no swelling in my legs. I have more 
energy, sleep better and have lost 5 pounds in one week. I am looking forward 
to becoming even healthier. I have increased to 4 glasses per day and will 
continue to drink this healing nectar that has changed my life.</p> 
<p>I have had a skin rash, itching, redness and infections in the fold of my 
belly where I had an operation 15 years ago. I have tried medication, salves, 
corn starch and even tried cotton cloth to try and stop the itching, redness 
and frequent infections. I started spraying my entire body with the acid water 
twice daily, morning and evening, and sprayed the fold line every time I used 
the washroom. To my amazement, there was instant relief and just after 5 days, 
15 years of suffering was over, no redness, itching or irritation. Imagine my 
surprise, wonder and excitement to finally feel great. My hair and entire body 
feels softer, smoother and healthier. To think the simplicity of acid water 
healed me where many medications failed. Thank you for my Jupiter Water 
Ionizer.&quot;</p>

Melody Ionizer. After soaking my feet in ionized acid water for 30 min I found 
myself wishing I had taken pictures before and after. Before the treatment my 
feet were dry, cracking and rough with lots of calluses. After the first 
treatment almost all of the calluses wiped off and the skin looks and feels 
like I rubbed oil on them. You have a great product. Thanks for all your 
help.&quot; <br>

<p>&quot;I love my ionizer. My bladder condition is slowly improving...The 
thing that I have really noticed is my skin on my face and particularly my 
neck. I am 55 and have always been told that I look young for my age but I have 
felt self-conscious about my neck in the past few years that started to show 
age. Since I started drinking the alkaline water the signs of aging on my neck 
are almost gone in only 3-4 weeks! This is amazing considering I smoked for 33 
years and stopped in Sept. 2010. I take 12 pills a day and I have four health 
conditions to deal with. I have been telling people about Best Water and the 
ionizer. Friends of mine have noticed my skin lately.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL HEALTH</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Replacing my reverse osmosis water purifier with a Jupiter Ionizer 
four months ago has been one of the best investments in my health that I have 
made. I used to wake up with a puffy face, which would take 2-3 hours to go 
away. I no longer have this problem. My eyes are clearer and brighter, my skin 
finer in texture, and I sleep soundly at night, no longer waking up with 
insomnia.<br>
 I now have the kind of energy which gets me through a very 
stressful job, in which I often do not have the time for a break, often working 
9-10 hours straight.<br>
 It is true that this water is not 'heavy' on the 
stomach; I'm able to drink without difficulty. Since changing my drinking water 
I have also lost about 3kg, and this being during a period where I actually 
reduced the amount of exercise I was doing! When I work out with weights, and 
drink up to a liter, my recovery is impressive - I no longer suffer the kinds 
of aches previously felt.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>ENERGY AND HYDRATION</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I know you will love to hear that we are over the moon with our water 
ionizer. Our neighbor is, as well, with hers. She even told us today that her 
husband who NEVER drinks water is starting to have a few glasses a day. She 
said she is personally drinking around 4 liters a day. Geoff and I seem to have 
a lot more energy and better mental clarity. We are now off all supplements, 
which were costing us a lot of money and find the ionized water, sprouts and 
organic veggies are enough.</p> 
<p>We gave a friend ionized water yesterday and didn't tell her what it was. 
She kept sipping away and started to say how wonderful it tasted. She also kept 
saying how alive we looked and how bright our eyes were. I really feel we can 
thank the ionizer for most of that as well.</p> 
<p>Our two year old grandson doesn't usually like to drink water. When I gave 
him the micro water he guzzled it all down and even started going into the 
kitchen asking for 'water'. I made the mistake of giving him ionized water last 
night before he went to bed. A sleepy boy was suddenly jumping out of his skin 
and he kept saying he was 'awake'.</p> 
<p>Needless to say we are happy to demonstrate the ionizers if you have 
inquires in this area. I know for sure that if you had an agent up here to show 
us the machine and let us taste the water we probably would have bought one 
much sooner.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>ENERGY, SLEEP, and FOOT ODOUR</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I am 50 years old and recently had a quadruple bypass. I started 
drinking the high alkaline water 6 months after my operation and noticed the 
antioxidizing qualities quite quickly. I sleep better, have more energy and my 
body craves this amazing water. I am more regular and feel great.</p> 
<p>I also use the acid water to control foot odour. I spray my boots and shoes 
on a regular basis and spray my feet morning and night. I find it amazing that 
the simplicity of acid water has made such an amazing difference. I no longer 
suffer with bad foot odour.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>SPIRITS, HEALTH and ENERGY</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I have no critical or major health problems. I bought our Jupiter 
ionization machine because after research I was convinced it was the best 
possible available water and that Jupiter was the best company. I have drunk 
the ionized water for over 3 years and wouldn't do without it. I find any other 
water not suitable. I love it and drink large amounts of it that keep me in 
good spirits, health and energy. I highly recommend ionized water and the

<p><strong>ARTHRITIS</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I wanted to let you know my experience using the Jupiter Melody and 
alkalizing my body. Prior to getting my Jupiter I had suffered from creeping 
and debilitating arthritis in both knees. My right knee I could barely bend. 
Walking had become difficult and running impossible without my knees swelling 
up. For a man under 50 this was not an exciting prospect.</p> 
<p>I had heard about alkaline water from my internet research and decided to 
give it a go. I purchased the Jupiter about 18 months ago and have not looked 
back. I drink between 5-6 large glasses a day. I also drastically cut my sugar 
intake down at the same time as starting drinking alkaline water. Now both my 
knees function PERFECTLY with no pain. I can walk, run and jump with no adverse 
reactions.</p> 
<p>Needless to say I am a strong advocate of alkalising. Thank you to Ion Life 
for this great product.&quot; -- Mike Logie</p> 
<p>&quot;When I started to drink this delicious water 6 years ago, it took 
about 4 weeks and all my arthritic pains in my thumb, wrists and knee 
disappeared, to be never heard of since. It helps my digestion and makes me 
feel clean inside out.&quot; -- Ama Kalda, Coorabell, Australia</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN'S TASTE FOR WATER, BETTER SLEEP</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;My family of 5 have been drinking the high alkaline ionized water for 
almost a year now with amazing results. The three children will drink water 
before asking for juice, pop, or even milk, which for young children ranging 
from 3 to 7 years of age is amazing. We used to go through 3 to 4 4liter jugs 
of milk in a week. We now only use one, which is mainly for cereal in the 
morning or cooking. Because of the active molecules in the water, we noticed 
that juice crystals also dissolve faster and more efficiently, which has cut 
down to 2/3 of the amount normally used to make the same amount of juice. The 
whole family feels better, sleeps better and has more energy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A HARD NUT TO CRACK</strong></p> 
<p>&quot; Dear Zaba, I couldn't be happier with my new water. Everyday I look 
forward to making my day's supply. My son likes it a lot too. In fact he drinks 
it now instead of that awful soda stuff. I have to tell you, my son is a hard 
nut to crack. For him to take to my new water is a miracle. He was an &quot;I 
don't care type&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;. If his soda had high fructose corn syrup 
[a proven chemical] or things of that nature, it just didn't matter to him. He 
was definitely a mountain dew boy. Now he fills up his ionized water jug and 
off to work he goes and feels so much better. I guess he was tired of drinking 
all the time and still being thirsty. He is a landscaper.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>TASTE and HYDRATION</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I can taste the water. I can tell it's ionized because I know what 
water is supposed to taste like. When we first tasted it we really knew this 
was the real McCoy. I also never liked drinking water. I would drink tap water 
and be dehydrated as a result. I decided that's it, I don't like it, it makes 
me feel bad, but when I found this water, it just went right in. I had another 
glass, and it tasted good, and it was then I realized I had been drinking the 
wrong water. I've continued drinking it since then. Of course, it makes good 
tea, it's good for cooking, food tastes better and the micro clustering and all 
the other reasons to take it are there. I think one of the main reasons is 
because I am aware, now, having had it for a long time, of the importance of 
minerals and trace elements, and how difficult it is with ordinary H2O to 
assimilate them. Most mineral supplements do zilch.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>CHRONIC ECZEMA and HYDRATION</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;My name is Anna Heiskari. This is my story; an expression of 
gratitude for being given the gift of Ionized water.</p> 
<p>I will begin with a description of my predisposition. I was born with 
chronic eczema to 50% of my body. My mother was an asthmatic who treated my 
skin following holistic principles, with emphasis on diet and avoidance of 
chemical detergents, soaps, creams etc. that might cause a reaction on my skin. 
With all this taken into account I was made comfortable at times, yet never 
totally free of my eczema and the restrictive hold it had on my life.</p> 
<p>Throughout my adult years I studied Naturopathy, Iridology and Kinesiology 
and various other alternative modalities in order to heal my eczema, and also 
to be able to help others.<br>
 In all this I found the key to being and 
feeling healthy was to alkalize the system.</p> 
<p>I had relied on my diet and other disciplines to achieve this, yet I was 
never able to break free of my inflammatory skin condition. It has been 
particularly challenging over the last 3 years, mostly affecting my hands, 
which were swollen, red, cracked and at times bleeding. Being uncomfortable 
about using or exposing my hands to my health practice clients, I ceased work 
as a Kinesiologist.<br>
 Almost a year ago I was introduced to the Jupiter 
Science Mavello water Ionizer. Immediately I began drinking the water it 
energized me. Within days I began to notice a remarkable change in myself, my 
eczema and my energy levels. I felt positive at last!<br>
 Today I have healthy 
glowing skin and I am totally free of any signs of eczema. The only difference 
in my life is the Jupiter water that I have begun drinking. The joy I now feel 
to stroke my little girl's soft cheek and to be able to hold her hand is just 
beyond wonderful.</p> 
<p>When I brought my Jupiter home it attracted the attention of my 17 year old 
son whom I will describe as a passionate sleeper. He mostly plays his computer 
in his waking moments and manages to drag himself up, cranky and tired, out of 
bed 20 minutes before school. He began drinking the Jupiter water. To my 
delight and surprise, he also began feeling energized, and broke his two year 
sleep pattern. I noticed his skin improving, and he looks more hydrated. 
Instead of a bottle of Coke by his side at the computer, he has a large glass 
flask of Jupiter water. His diet has changed spontaneously. No more sweet foods 
and take-aways; they no longer hold any attraction for him, and my vegetarian 
cooking is no longer rejected.</p> 
<p>I give my water away to my friends and they have all commented favorably. 
Ionized water is life giving. It helps the body to return to its natural 
balance. It supports the system in regeneration of healthy cells, and saturates 
it with life giving energy. It is so amazing that this free radical-fighting 
power comes from ordinary water. It is just so simple. All you need to do is 
drink it.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Two years ago I was diagnosed with Chronic Progressive MS (Multiple 
Sclerosis). The Neurologist I saw said there was no known cure, offered me a 
few words of advice, like don't stress yourself and said she would prescribe a 
drug for me, that I would have for three days at the hospital, that would help 
slow the MS process down. I could never accept such a pronouncement and I 
depleted all my savings with attempts at alternative treatments, such as 
Homeopathy, Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Chiropractic and many supplements. I now 
realize I was depressed from that day. MS is a word, not a sentence, but for me 
the term &quot;Chronic Progressive MS&quot; certainly seemed like a life 
sentence.</p> 
<p>I suffered a common problem of most people with Multiple Sclerosis and that 
is fatigue, not having the energy to do anything. I couldn't tolerate the hot 
summers; my internal organs began giving up on me, (I felt like an old person 
losing control) ---My walking got progressively worse and I began using a 
stick, my eyesight would bother me at times and the feeling of numbness in my 
left leg was there most of the time, in fact my left leg never really felt 
normal.</p> 
<p>Today I am no longer depressed, I have lost the look of fatigue, my 
internal organs are working normally again. &quot;Your mind seems 
sharper&quot;, is the comment from a close friend. This same friend says I seem 
more willing to engage in things despite my body, and my movement seems faster 
where at one time it was labored. (I still use a stick) My eyes are brighter, I 
look happier and smile more now and have excitement in my voice and I have a 
look of peace and wellness about me.</p> 
<p>Drinking Jupiter water was to me like drinking silk, it felt so clean and 
that transferred to my body. For two weeks it was being brought to me and I 
drank 4 liters a day, keeping a bottle by my side all the time. With all the 
remarkable changes going on in me, it was clear to me that I couldn't not drink 
this water, neither could I deny it to my son so I now have a Jupiter in my 
home. Because ionized water flushes away acid waste, I experienced my own 
healing crises. I had a week of heaviness, lethargy and headaches, but now this 
too has passed and I feel great again.<br>
 I am aware that waste must be 
flushed out and this has been my experience as the water does its work. I am so 
grateful for Jupiter water; especially after all the modalities I have tried. 
These days I wake up alive again, and my son now drinks the water because he 
sees the effect it has on me. How grateful I am!&quot;<br>

<p> <strong>VITALITY and MEMORY</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Old? Ha! I'm in my 80s, and began drinking Jupiter water about 18 
months ago. At my age I have come to expect that getting up in the morning is a 
chore and that energy is not something I have a great deal of. I am also aware 
that my memory has been going from bad to worse.</p> 
<p>My kids call it my 'Whatchmacallit' syndrome as my sentences slowly fill up 
with forgotten words. Within a month of beginning Jupiter water, the changes 
were profound. I walked from home to the beach, 2 kilometers along the beach, 
and up about 60 steps to a lookout.</p> 
<p>My kids were amazed, but I didn't even think about it. The energy was just 
there! I have had a recurrent eye infection for a long time and it has cleared 
up. My inflamed gum, another long-term problem, has also cleared, and my tinea 
underwent its own 'healing crisis' and dried out from underneath the skin. My 
memory, my kids tell me, is much, much better, and that's a wonderful thing for 
me, having seen my sister succumb to Dementia.</p> 
<p>I am also more aware of my food. I am aware of my choices and have stopped 
the 'hungry ghosts' ~ my need to nibble. I believe that the way the Jupiter 
reduces the molecule size of the water has helped my brain to re-hydrate. So 
many older people drink far too little. I read about a doctor specialist in 
Geriatrics who healed his patients through getting them to drink water. That's 
true, but the water most of us drink, even filtered water, is nothing like as 
easy to drink as Jupiter water.</p> 
<p>I drink it and love to drink it. It restored my 'natural' thirst, and I 
only realized I had lost it when it came back. I think as a nation we are all 
dehydrated and all acidic overloaded. If this water was available through our 
taps this country would be a very different, healthier one than what it is 
today.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>DETOXIFICATION, ENERGY, HAIR and SKIN</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I have been drinking the high alkaline water and using the acid 
stream as an astringent for almost a year now. I found amazing benefits in 
both. The first noticeable change was in the detoxification qualities of the 
alkaline stream. My body started cleaning itself within 3 days of starting, and 
has become more regular than I can remember. I have more energy, sleep better 
and can focus on long tasks without becoming sluggish and tired. I use the 
alkaline water for cooking. I found that water boils approximately 2/3 faster 
than tap water, foods cook faster, vegetables look brighter and taste better. I 
believe that more of the nutrients stay in the food, which is a benefit.</p> 
<p>The benefits of the acid stream as an astringent and a cleaning agent are 
second to none. I have natural curly hair which was always frizzy and felt like 
wire. Rinsing with acid water after shampooing and spraying twice daily has 
resulted in soft, shiny, silky curls. I spray my entire body with acid water 
after my shower, dry skin is no longer a problem, small skin irritations have 
disappeared. Using acid water as a cleaning agent, I found that it neutralized 
strong cleaner odours, leaving a clean fresh scent. Using acid water in 
humidifiers and small water fountains has resulted in less scale build up, and 
helps remove odours from the air such as smoke. I would recommend the use of 
the Jupiter water ionizer to all persons everywhere. Thank you Jupiter.&quot;

<p> <strong>DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I had digestive problems for over 10 years and tried different 
approaches. In 2002 I bought the Jupiter Regenesis 2000 (also because I really 
didn't like the tap water any more). My digestion improved after 4-6 weeks 
using this water. I went to the toilet more regularly. When I put it on a 
higher number, like 4, it was so strong even a real constipation couldn't 
resist that.</p> 
<p>Over the years I see that even financially the Regenesis has its advantages 
compared to bought water bottles. My friend got big water bottles delivered. 
She spent $20 per month. So in 3 years the Reg. 2000 has already paid for 
itself.</p> 
<p>My roommates like the water also very much, and give me a monthly support 
/share. We use the first gallon (acid water during the cleaning cycle, ed.) for 
watering our plants and the acid water to rinse bottles, so there is no waste.
<br> The coffee and tea taste much better since we use this water. We use it 
also for soups and cooking. I can really recommend it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are very pleased with our unit!! My husband who has had chronic 
constipation since he was a little boy and has been taking Senekot &amp; 2

cups a day of the water &amp; can't believe the change. He feels better &amp; 
more relaxed because of it...this one health benefit has been a great boon to 
us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since drinking this ionized water I have almost eliminated the 
embarrassing gas &amp; bloating I'd been having. It may be that this is because 
I'm just overall drinking more water but that is fine with me. I had been using 
a filter on my tap water but my throat would seem to close up and I would 
&quot;choke&quot; on the tap water. The water from the ionizer is smooth and 
tastes clean. I have no problem drinking 50 oz or more a day.</p> 
<p>I also have noticed that my knee doesn't hurt as much and that a wart I 
have on my finger is definitely reduced in size.</p>

<p><strong>HYPER-ACIDITY</strong></p> 
<p>About l years ago, I went to see a gastric specialist. For a long time I 
had gastric disorder. I took a lot of antacid and charcoal pills. Prior to 
seeing the specialist I was taking these medications everyday because I was 
feeling great discomfort. At times, it was so bad that I even dreaded sleeping 
at night as there would be this extreme discomfort near my chest and sometimes 
there was a kind of funny bubbly feeling so closed to my heart. At that time, I 
thought it was a heart condition. I went to see a specialist. They did an 
endoscopy and they told me it was hyperacidity and some inflammation of the 
duodenum. My doctor put me on medication. The condition cleared for about 3 
months and then the discomfort returned. Somehow, subsequent medications did 
not work as well as before.</p> 
<p>Sometime around Sept/Oct 2001, my sister-in-law bought a Jupiter 
antioxidant water ionizer. She told me about some of its qualities being 
antioxidant and alkaline in nature. One day, I was at their home and I took a 
glass of this water. And perhaps because of my heightened sensitivity, I could 
actually sense a difference - I felt somewhat more comfortable. From that time 
onward, I took this water regularly over the course of 2 to 3 months. And every 
week as I took it, I would feel better. Sometime at the end of December, I 
decided to test out and see how things would go. I then stopped for a while and 
wonderfully, all the symptoms and pains never came back. I did not take any 
medication from that time onwards. I was able to sleep well. In fact, prior to 
that, I had difficulty taking things like coffee and tea. I understand now that 
it was due to pH imbalance and I would feel very uncomfortable. But now, I 
could drink my coffee and tea in moderation.</p> 
<p>The Jupiter antioxidant alkaline water has certainly made a difference to 
me.</p>

<p><strong>KNEE PAIN, INDIGESTION, FOOD CRAVINGS</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;After purchasing our Jupiter water purifier five months ago, I have 
been drinking 3 to 4 liters daily. We found the Bathurst water supply had a 
consistent pH reading of 7, so we started off on the lower setting, drinking 
alkaline water with a pH of 8. We then progressed to the higher settings and 
have been consuming pH 9 ever since.</p> 
<p>Prior to Ionized water I had aches and pains in my knees which I suspected 
to be ligament or cartilage damage after a long sporting life. This eventually 
dissipated and when I visited my Naturopath yesterday he confirmed, via his 
computer iridology scan, there was no longer any visual signs of uric acid in 
the body. It's great to be able to run up and down stairs again without 
hindrance. He also showed me the fibers in my eyes controlling my kidneys had 
improved, and these were more clearly defined, indicating better organ 
functioning. I advised him my candida had also improved and he confirmed this 
by showing me that the discolored spots (mucus) around my eyes had lightened 
since my previous scan.</p> 
<p>My wife Rhonda had suffered from indigestion for many years before drinking 
the alkaline water. Her digestive system has improved and she is no longer 
dependent upon Bi-Carb Soda or Enos for relief. She has also noticed 
improvement to her knees (also problems due to sport) and we have both lost 
about 5k in 5 months, mainly around our waistlines. We found a glass of water 
quickly suppressed the appetite and stopped us snacking on inappropriate food 
between meals. The antioxidant water has proved very addictive and it made us 
crave for more. Rhonda recently commented that we haven't had the dreaded hay 
fever this year (first time for 20 years), thus no drugs have been required for 
relief.</p> 
<p>After recently completing a course of external chemotherapy (Efudix) to 
treat skin cancers, I found the healing process to repair the skin more rapid, 
after treating my internal system with the alkaline water (antioxidants), and 
my external body with the acid water (astringent).</p> 
<p>We have also been using the acid water on our garden and indoor plants. As 
the Bathurst climate is very extreme it is difficult to grow azaleas, but the 
acid water is doing the trick. Our indoor peace lilies have bloomed for the 
second time in six months, (an annual occurrence only prior to Jupiter 
watering). The acid water is also proving a good pesticide for the vegie 
garden, eliminating the use of those nasty chemicals, which previously found 
their way into our bodies and did untold damage.</p>

<p><strong>LEG CRAMPS</strong></p>
<p>We just came back from camping in our trailer and we took our Melody 
Ionizer with us. It was easy to pack and we installed it just the same as at 
home. It was wonderful having the purified water on tap. For years we always 
hauled bottled water with us in the trailer and this was much better than 
carrying all that extra weight of containers of water.</p>
<p>It was also great not having to worry about running out of drinking water. 
I am so glad we bought this water system. It makes wonderful water! By the way, 
my Mom's legs cramps have disappeared since drinking ionized water. She stopped 
drinking it for a few days and the cramps came back with a vengeance. She 
increased her calcium and magnesium intake but that had very little effect. 
Once she got back on the alkaline water the leg cramps disappeared! What a 
great double blind study we created.</p>

<p><strong>FAMILY BENEFITS</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Our family has been using the Jupiter Water Ionizer for the past two 
weeks and we have noticed quite a change in all of us.</p> 
<p>Our youngest is 16 months old, has had more energy throughout the day; 
which, to our favour, has been sleeping better through the night. When she gets 
thirsty, she picks up her cup and points to the water cooler. However, I would 
advise parents who breast feed to take into consideration that your child is 
consuming more water than we realize.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the three adults in the family have had some changes 
also, to say the least! We have become more regular in our bowel movement. Our 
bodies have been releasing toxins through flatulation and through excessive 
urination.</p> 
<p>We have also been using the acid water, which has cleared up dandruff. It 
has also helped with uncontrollable hair frizz and has made hair feel like 
silk. These are, however, minor to someone who has been using this system for 
some time.</p> 
<p>These are only some changes that have occurred over a two week period, so 
one can just imagine the potential health benefits using this system over a 
lifetime, which we are definitely looking forward to.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>TASTE and HYDRATION</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;Since more than three years I am drinking the ionized water and I am 
so much enjoying it. I never used to drink a lot of water, because I simply 
didn't like the acidic taste to it. When I began to drink the soft and 
refreshing ionized water, my whole body responded to its alkaline and hydrating 
qualities. Now I am ONLY drinking water 'ionized water- and I am missing it 
when we eat out. Such a basic and simple device has greatly improved the most 
important physical nourishment in our lives.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>CURING FOOT ULCERS</strong></p> 
<p>Dr Robert O. Young, ION LIFE water drinker and alkaline balance pioneer 
sent us this story that he received from a client recently:</p>
<p>&quot;I had a small toe on my left foot that had turned black down to the 
1st joint and had to be removed. While in the hospital an ulcer on the ball of 
my big toe had formed. The doctor decided that if it were removed he could 
stitch up the area in order for it to heal itself. After many surgeries in an 
attempt to get the ulcer to heal, nothing seemed to make any improvement.</p> 
<p>A while later a visiting nurse recommended a wound vacuum to be placed on 
the ulcer in an attempt to keep the area dry. This procedure went on for 2 1/2 
months with no change at all. My surgeon abandoned the vacuum treatment and 
then wanted to stitch up the bottom of my foot again. I didn't want to go 
through with this process again. This is because it hadn't worked before and I 
had great doubts as to whether it would work this time as well.</p> 
<p>I began to talk to a Doctor in Springfield who had high hopes for me. From 
his conversation and the tests he would perform he thought I might get some 
much-needed relief from having to bandage this wound everyday. I was very 
disappointed to find out he was going down the same path as my previous surgeon 
not to mention I wasn't getting any results from the tests he had ordered 
either.</p> 
<p>My wife and I left Springfield and never looked back. I told my wife I was 
going home and soak my feet in this pH water [acid] that my brother Jerry had 
gotten from you. I hoped this was going to work like he had heard it would from 
others. To be honest with you, I had my doubts but decided to give the water a 
try anyway.</p> 
<p>I warmed the water up and soaked my left foot in it for about 45-60 
minutes. I then allowed my foot to air dry and bandaged it. After doing this 
procedure for 3 days (December 21-24) on Christmas Eve I changed the bandage. 
To my surprise I noticed that the wound was healed over and the area was firm 
to the touch. I couldn't believe it at first and called to my wife to come have 
a look to confirm what I was seeing. My wife had the same reaction that I had; 
she couldn't believe it was finally healed!</p> 
<p>It has been almost exactly 1 year to date since the ulcer appeared, which 
has caused me to miss work for 6 months straight, not to mention all the money 
that was lost in wages. I can't begin to tell you what this healing pH miracle 
water has done for me. It has given me restored faith in God and his healing. I 
wish we had heard about this water many months ago.</p> 
<p>Thank you so much!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>ACNE</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I am 17 years old and I have had bad acne for approximately five 
years. I cannot remember a day that I went out without wearing make-up to cover 
up the blemishes. For the past three weeks alkaline water is just about the 
only water I drink. My face has rapidly changed and I have very little acne 
left.&quot;(Editor's note: acne is treated with a combination of water ionizer 
treatments: theacid ionized water is applied to the skin, and high alkaline

<p><strong>COMMERCIAL ANTI-MOLD AGENT; TASTE</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;My name is Nirjan, and I grow wheatgrass commercially in a controlled 
environment and I was introduced to the ionizer, and one of the points that was 
emphasized was the use of the waste water: that it was acidic and that it 
suppresses the growth of molds. And I was having quite a problem with molds in 
the early days. So I would spray the waste water -- the acidic water -- on the 
young plants, and I would do that several times a day. It kept the plants 
healthy during their growth period. It was a very good corrective measure for 
that.</p> 
<p>But what I would enjoy more than anything was the ionization factor, making 
the water more easily absorbable. My first experience in drinking it was just 
awesome. I think had a couple of mouthfuls. You know when you drink water you 
get that kind of bloated feeling, that full feeling in the stomach? It wasn't 
like that at all! I drank it and I could feel it disappear into my body. You 
could feel it reach every limb. It was a wonderful feeling to feel it in my 
body.</p> 
<p>In my wheatgrass growing operation we (also) use the alkaline water, set on 
a number 4 setting. We use it for seed soaks and seed rinses and we've been 
using it for three years now, we go through such a volume of it.</p> 
<p>There was a time though that we hadn't been drinking it for some time. We 
must have gone a couple of weeks without it. And when we started drinking it 
again, we realized how much we missed it! It tastes so good. It's alive and 
refreshing. We use it in everything we do. We have people coming and staying 
with us from all over the world. They fill up their water bottles from us, and 
they just love it -- they can really tell the difference.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>VITASHOWER FILTER</strong></p> 
<p>Listen to Carol's surprising experience: </p>
<p>&quot;I'm very sensitive to Chlorine. So many winters especially, when the 
indoor heat is on, I've been plagued by my body's itchy skin. When I started 
using Vitashower, that all changed and I haven't had that problem since.</p>
<p>I was told that I could test to see how Chlorine is absorbed through the 
skin. I put tap water in a little glass, tested for Chlorine. It tested yellow, 
showing there was chlorine in the water. Then I put my finger in the water for 
10 seconds. When I tested a second time, the water was clear, indicating that 
the chlorine had been absorbed into my skin.</p> 
<p>I wanted to make sure it wasn't just in my mind that the Vitashower was 
removing the Chlorine, so I decided to do my own testing. Taking water from my 
bath tap, I tested for Chlorine and the water turned yellow, which indicates 
the presence of Chlorine. The water coming out of the Vitashower was crystal 
clear when tested. Wow! This is really great news for people who shower every 
day.</p> 
<p>Also, now I tell people with children that the Vitabath is a must. Don't 
soak your child in Chlorinated water. You can look up the dangers on the net. 
If you have a small tub for your young baby, you can break a tablet in half or 
quarters.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>ALKALIFE DROPS</strong></p> 
<p>Reports from AlkaLife users</p> 
<p><strong>Jack M Anchorage, AK</strong><br>
 I am 58 years old, very active 
until I was afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis. It all started in 1990 in a 
minor form, and in 1996 I went downhill. After thousands of dollars for many of 
the cures I became very discouraged. It affected every joint in my body, my 
ankles and toes, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, hands, fingers, neck and my 
right jawbone. I became despondent; a word I thought would never enter my 
vocabulary.</p> 
<p>I can testify with absolute certainty that from the date of starting on 
AlkaLife, which is about a month now, the improvement in my health is almost 
miraculous. The pain is gone entirely, my mobility has improved beyond 
description. A month ago I had to use a motorized wheel cart to shop. I still 
waddle like a duck as I walk, but I can now shop for long periods of time on my 
feet.</p> 
<p>Even though I have quit smoking over a year ago my circulation was really 
bad, and I am sure that the arthritis affected the circulation also. It was 
necessary to cover myself in bed with a down filled comforter and wear wool 
socks to keep me warm. After taking AlkaLife I have recently discarded the 
comforter and the wool socks, my body is toasty warm with just a sheet and a 
blanket.</p> 
<p>This may not sound like much of an achievement to those who have never 
experienced severe pain and confinement, but it has brought tears of joy and 
thanks to our good God for this blessing you have created in my life and 
others. It may take several months to make a full recovery but the fact that we 
know AlkaLife is reversing the serious problems that myself and others have had 
is a sign of getting better and extending our lives in a productive manner. I 
feel you have penetrated the very marrow of health by working at the cause 
instead of the symptom.</p> 
<p>It is through dedication and hard work by people like you that will take 
those like me out of the courtyard and into the vineyard. THANK YOU, Mr. Whang!
</p> 
<p><strong>Peggy K Charlotte, North Carolina</strong><br>
 AlkaLife completely 
stopped the debilitating gout attacks my husband suffered several times each 
year. He would often be unable to walk for several weeks. Since he has been 
taking AlkaLife he has not had an attack. I had begun to notice stiffness in my 
hands and knees and since taking AlkaLife this has diminished considerably. My 
digestion improved greatly which enabled me to enjoy a wider variety of foods. 
If AlkaLife is good for humans I decided that it must be good for animals. I 
can see a great difference in my 10 dogs health, especially as it pertains to 
arthritis and improved kidney function. My old 16-year-old doggie is going 
great and I attribute much of his health to AlkaLife. Many, many thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Pain, Sleep, Eczema, Overall Health - Dr. Chris Rolston, N.D. 
&#150; Edmonton, AB, Canada</strong> <br>
As a naturopathic doctor I recognized 
the applications of this amazing technology right away. Clean water is a luxury 
in today&#146;s world, and this water is purified, alkalinized, oxygenated and 
vitalized as well. I know of the beneficial effects of alkalinizing the body 
through diet and cleansing, and was delighted to find a way of assisting this 
quality in the body through something as simple as water.</p> 
<p> This water is medicine for those that drink it! I have recommended this 
water for many patients with impressive results. I have seen it work wonders 
for patients with a variety of conditions, including allergies, eczema, muscle 
pain, back and joint pain, insomnia, and especially for athletes. Inflammatory 
and allergic phenomena occurring in the body are acidic processes that can be 
neutralized effectively with anything alkaline through diet, water or lifestyle 
changes. The body&#146;s metabolism produces acidic waste products that can 
build up and promote inflammation, pain and other health problems.</p> 
<p><strong>Diabetes, Regularity - Glen H. - Colorado</strong><br>
 I&#146;m a 
Ph.D. research scientist, as well as a chiropractor, acupuncturist, physical 
therapist and clinical nutritionist. I live with my wife and two sons in the 
Denver area of Colorado. I was first introduced to the Jupiter alkaline ionized 
water about 6 months ago by a long-time friend. Both of my sons and my wife are 
doctors, as well, and now we all enjoy this fantastic water.</p> 
<p>I was praying for the development of this water for some time, based simply 
on the chemistry I already knew to exist, that was sufficient enough in mineral 
content to be of a higher natural alkalinity.</p> 
<p>I, myself, had a massive stroke in January of 2005. I could not walk, could 
not read, was in therapy for over 30 days, could not gauge distances properly 
and had developed Type-2 Diabetes. Because of these conditions, I had maxed out 
my high blood pressure and Diabetes medications and could barely even control 
it - not a good or promising sign. In addition to all of this, I have also been 
severely constipated for over 20 years. I experienced my first normal bowel 
movement in 20 years on the 32nd day of drinking the alkaline ionized water. In 
my opinion, alkaline ionized water is singularly the only metabolically correct 
water for the human being.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Activity, Digestion, Vitality - Dr. Eric Fairbank,

months later, I feel 20 years younger and rarely have any problems. Also my 
digestive problems just disappeared!</p> 
<p><strong>Overall Health - Dr. Theodore (Ted) A. Baroody DC. ND Ph.D</strong>
<br>I have very rigorously tested the Electrolyzed Water unit in clinical

technologically sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. From my 
testing the pH range is 10.0 pH on alkaline level 4 and goes down to 4.2 pH on 
acid level 4.</p> 
<p><strong>Degenerative Disease - Dr. Sherry Rogers</strong><br>
After 
carefully evaluating the results of my advice to hundreds of individuals, 
I&#146;m convinced that toxicity in the form of acidic waste is the primary 
cause of degenerative disease. Alkaline water rids the body of acid waste.</p>

<p><strong> BACK PAIN, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ATHLETES</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Chris Rolston, N.D., Edmonton, Alberta</p>

patients with chronic health problems. The alkalinizing level can also be 
adjusted to match the patients' needs.</p> 
<p>I have personally experienced benefit from this water. I have had a chronic 
back problem that was causing me considerable pain at times. I found pain 
relief with the alkalinized water within 24 hours. I continue to drink this 
water and even take it with me to work and on vacation, for its pain-relieving 
and anti-inflammatory properties. I have been able to continue to be more 
active and enjoy more activities like cycling, as a result of this amazing and 
therapeutic technology.</p> 
<p>I recommend clean purified water for everyone. This water filter provides 
so much more than the average water filter ' this is the only machine that 
filters, alkalinizes and oxygenates the water all at the same time. Whether for 
general health, cleansing, or for a specific health problem this water filter 
is an intelligent and beneficial investment in your health.</p> 
<p><strong>BETTER PERSONAL HEALTH</strong></p> 
<p>Alan Bennett LMP, NMT </p> &quot;I have been a massage therapist and 
holistic healthcare practitioner for approximately 35 years now. For all of 
that time, I have consistently had to do fingernail care twice per week in 
order to keep from scratching my clients. I have tried various healthful diets 
and 'detox' diets in my decades of experience, and in all of that time my 
fingernail hardness has also been consistent; they have been a little 
soft/flexible and just a tad bit brittle.
<p>I started using the Melody Ionizer from Best Water about nine months ago. 
Approximately 4 months ago I noticed that I was needing to do my nail care more 
often. By about three months ago I found that I needed to be doing my nail care 
every other day, and my nails were so strong that I could virtually use them as 
screwdrivers! That change in my routine has remained consistent for the last 
three months, and so have my nails. The only thing that has changed 
significantly in my personal health regimen in all of that time is the addition 
of the Melody ionizer from Best Water.</p> 
<p>No other diet or change in my supplementation or nutrition has ever made 
such a dramatic difference to my fingernails as drinking the ionized water for 
9 months has, and I take that as a clear sign that my Melody ionizer has 
improved my overall health at the cellular level.</p> 
<p>A number of my friends and clients and neighbors who have noticed the 
changes in me have offered to buy replacement filters for me if they can come 
over and fill their water jugs regularly with water from my Melody ionizer, so 
they can receive the same benefits! This is actually bringing our neighborhood 
together in a wonderfully healthy, holistic way that I had never even 
considered.</p> 
<p>We have also noticed generally better personal health (stronger immune 
system, shinier hair, better digestion, etc.), as well as our pets and plants 
visibly being healthier.</p>
<p>When we got it we ran a series of pH checks and discovered that it performs 
<i>exactly</i> as advertised. The settings change the pH in nice increments of 
.5 at a time so you can &quot;dial in&quot; what you need for every situation, 
and that's<i>absolutely invaluable</i> if you really know how to use it.</p> 
<p>I love my Melody ionizer. As a holistic healthcare practitioner (in acute 
and chronic pain management and injury rehabilitation), I can't think of any 
single thing I would recommend as highly as drinking ionized water for general 
and consistent improvement in anyone's health at the cellular level. It's just 
the simplest and most profound thing you can do yourself, for your own health. 
After all, our bodies are more than two thirds water. Would you rather your 
body fluids be sludgy like a stagnant swamp, or clear and light like a 
swift-flowing river? The answer to that question tells you whether you want to 
get a water ionizer or not.&quot;</p>
<p> <strong> PROFOUND LONG-TERM EFFECT</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Ingfreid Hobert MD</p> 
<p>You do not need expensive medicine with all the negative side effects to 
regain health. Alkaline water has profound long term effects because it 
alkalizes your body and provides an effective antioxidant.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong> ENDORSEMENT OF ELECTROLYZED REDUCED WATER</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Theodore (Ted) A. Baroody DC. ND Ph.D</p> 
<p>I have very rigorously tested the Electrolyzed Water unit in clinical 
anecdotal situations. It is definitely a health benefit to anyone who would use 
it. I predict that the use of electronically restructured water will change

acid level 4.</p> 
<p>Through a very detailed system of muscle testing analysis covering 170 
areas, called Biokinetics, I have seen the following areas strengthened and 
stabilized on my clients by restructured water obtained by the Electrolyzed 
Water unit:</p> </li>
<li>chemical poisons</li> 
<li>kidney gravel</li> 
<li>alkaline / acid imbalances</li>

<p><strong>A CHIROPRACTOR'S PERSPECTIVE</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Daniel Bettiol</p> 
<p>Dr. Daniel Bettiol is leaving the profession of Chiropractic to pursue his 
clinically-tested belief that the primary causative factor in Headaches, Neck 
&amp; Low Back pain is Dehydration of the tissues and the inability to 
eliminate accumulated Metabolic wastes from the body.</p> 
<p>While treating over 3,500 patients and delivering over 120,000 chiropractic 
adjustments, Dr. Bettiol observed that over 90% of his patients were 
inadequately hydrated.</p> 
<p>&quot;My most consistent finding was that 100% of my chronic Headache and 
Low Back patients were severely dehydrated. Many of these patients acknowledged 
an absolute disdain for drinking water,&quot; says Dr. Bettiol. &quot;For those 
patients who adopted my daily water regimen, an immediate decrease in pain 
symptomology was observed. That result was too consistent to be a 
coincidence.&quot;&gt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Dr. Bettiol is determined to continue the work of Fereydoon Batmanghelidj, 
M.D., who wrote the 1992 best-seller, Your Body's many cries for Water. Dr. 
Batmanghelidj died in 2005, but his signature slogan &quot;You are not Sick, 
you are Thirsty---Don't treat thirst with Medications&quot; lives on. &quot;Dr. 
Batmanghelidj warned the public back in the 1980s that America's thirst for 
Soda, Coffee, and Sugar-filled drinks would create a huge population of 
unhealthy and obese people,&quot; says Dr. Bettiol. &quot;To say his prediction 
was accurate would be a gross understatement.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bettiol begins his new journey with the firm opinion that ALL water is not 
optimum for health. His extensive research has shown that Tap, Bottled, 
Charcoal-filtered, Distilled and Reverse Osmosis Water is NOT the ideal Water 
for long-term health and healing. &quot;America has ignored the miraculous 
healing being experienced by the Koreans and Japanese with Ionized Alkaline 
Water,&quot; says Bettiol. &quot;Where Bill Gates vision was a computer in 
every home, my lifetime mission is to get an Alkaline Water Ionizer in every 
home throughout the world. That would not only eliminate obesity, chronic pain 
and the need for useless Medication, Surgery &amp; Radiation...it would 
single-handedly cut our annual $1.5 Trillion health care costs by 90%.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather people spend more time with their families, their 
hobbies and the work they love, than sit in a doctor's office for four hours 
waiting for a doctor's visit they really DON'T NEED.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>ENERGY</b></p>
<p>Dr. B. Sengstock</p>
<p></p> 
<p>When chiropractor Dr. Bernhard Sengstock of New York heard about IonWays 
alkaline, ionized water, he was at first quite skeptical. But when one of his 
patients explained the remarkable benefits, he decided to give it a try. Before 
he started passing out the water to his patients, he thought it practical to 
make himself a case-study for IonWays water.</p>
<p>Every year, Dr. Sengstock challenges his stamina with a 3&frac12; mile, 
soft-sand run. With every passing year, his run along the Atlantic Coast of 
Long Island proved more and more difficult. Joint pain and lack of energy 
hindered his ability to complete the goal he had set for himself 
year-after-previous-year. In an effort to test the water's ability to improve 
his results on the sand, Dr. Sengstock began drinking a half-gallon of IonWays 
water every day for two weeks. It was only after he finished his annual run 
with no joint pain and energy to spare that he became an enthusiastic advocate 
of IonWays water.</p> 
<p>Dr. Sengstock encourages his patients to drink IonWays water and has seen a 
tremendous amount of positive feedback, including significant weight-loss, 
increased energy, and one patient who used the acidic water to help heal a

<p>Dr.T. Watanabe and Y. Kishikawa</p> 
<p>&quot;Alkaline ionized water (AKW) is used for the purpose of supplementing 
electrolytes and water lost by perspiration during exercise and for preserving 
health, because AKW is easily absorbed by the body and is excellent at 
regulating osmotic pressure<i>in vivo.</i></p> <strong>Top of Page</strong>

<p><strong>MUSCULAR PAIN</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Eric Fairbank, Naturopath, Australia</p> 
<p>&quot;For years I suffered uncomfortable rheumatic muscular aches / pains 
and digestive problems. After only 3-4 days of drinking alkaline water my 
muscular endurance improved dramatically. Now 12 months later, I feel 20 years 
younger and rarely have any problems. Also my digestive problems just 
disappeared!&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</strong></p> 
<p> Prof. Kuninaka Hironage, Head of Kuninaka Hospital</p> 
<p>For over 10 years of my experience, my concept toward minerals, especially 
pertaining to ionic calcium in high blood pressure and other diseases, is most 
significant.</p> 
<p>In accordance to the theory of medical Professor Gato of Kyushu University 
on Vitamin K (because vitamin K enables the blood calcium to increase), or the 
consumption of more ionized water, the effectiveness of the increase in the 
calcium in high blood pressure is most significant. Too many fats in the diets, 
which lead to the deposition of cholesterol on the blood vessels, which in turn 
constrict the blood flow, cause most illnesses such as high blood pressure.</p> 
<p>By drinking ionized water for a period of 2 to 3 months, the blood pressure 
should slowly drop, because the ionized water is a good solvent, which 
dissolves the cholesterol in the blood vessels.</p> 
<p><b>PRE-ECLAMPTIC TOXEMIA</b></p> 
<p>Prof. Watanabe Ifao. Watanabe Hospital</p> 
<p>Ionized water improves body constituents and ensures effective healing to 
many illnesses. The uses of ionized water in gynecological patients has proved 
to be very effective. The main reason for its effectiveness is that this water 
can neutralize toxins.</p> 
<p>When giving ionized water to pre-eclamptic toxemia cases, the results are 
very significant. During my long years of servicing pre-eclamptic toxemia 
cases, I found that women with pre-eclamptic toxemia who consumed ionized water 
tend to deliver healthier babies with stronger muscles. A survey report carried 
out on babies in this group has intelligence above average.</p> <strong>Top of

<p><strong>HEADACHE</strong></p> 
<p>A Naturopath's Experience with Ionized water and dark Field Microscopy<br>
 
Sue Pollock, N.D. is the principal of Ballina Naturopathy</p> 
<p>A Man in his late 40s presented to my clinic with chronic headaches. Had 
been seeing his doctor and chiropractor with no changes in his symptoms. On 
Live Blood examination using a microscope we found he had lots of chemical and 
uric acid crystals (works on a farm), as well as massive platelet clusters 
(clotting factors).<br>
 After discussing his water source (rain water with 
chemical drift), he decided it could be beneficial to purchase and use the 
ionized water from a Jupiter System. He was also prescribed supplements to 
reduce his platelet size and numbers, feeling this build-up could be causing 
his headaches (blood vessels to head restrict flow). I normally check the blood 
after 3 months, but in this case, because I referred him back to a GP, we 
wanted to look at his blood before the visit, only eight days after the initial 
examination and only four days after being on the water.<br>
 I did not expect 
to see much change, as normally the supplements take a few months to show 
radical improvement, but hoped to see a slight shift to show we were on the 
right track.<br>
 Well, we were both amazed, as his blood looked great. All 
crystals were gone and platelets had reduced to completely normal size and 
number. He also said that since drinking the alkaline water he had more energy 
and he'd only had one headache which was before he started the water. (He was 
having major headaches every second day and dull headaches the other days). He 
feels the results were to do with drinking the water and I tend to agree as the 
supplements as great as they are don't usually work that fast. I am glad I'm 
drinking the water too.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>HEART DISEASE</strong></p> 
<p>Prof. Kuwata Keijiroo, Doctor of Medicine</p> 
<p>In my opinion, the wonder of ionized water is the ability to neutralize 
toxins; but it is not a medicine. The difference is that the medicines can only 
be applied to each individual case. Whereas ionized water can be consumed 
generally, and its neutralizing power is something which is very much 
unexpected. Now, in brief, let me introduce to you a heart disease case and how 
it was cured.<br>
 The patient was a 35 year old male suffering from vascular 
heart disease. For 5 years, his sickness deteriorated. He was in the Setagays 
Government Hospital for treatment.</p> 
<p>During those 5 years, he had been in and out of the hospital 5 to 6 times. 
He had undergone high tech examinations such as angiogram by injecting VINYL 
via the vein into the heart. He consulted and sought treatment from many good 
doctors. Later he underwent a major surgical operation. Upon his discharge from 
the hospital, he quit his job to convalesce. However, each time when his 
illness relapsed, the attack seemed to be even more severe. Last year, in 
August, his relatives were in despair and expected he would not live much 
longer. It so happened at that time that the victim's relative came across an 
ionized water processor. His illness responded well and he is now on the road 
to recovery.</p> 
<p>Note: In the United States, cardiovascular diseases account for more than 
one-half of the approximate 2 million deaths occurring each year. It is 
estimated that optimal conditioning of drinking water could reduce this 
cardiovascular disease mortality rate by as much as 15 percent in the United 
States.&quot; (From: Report of the Safe Drinking Water committee of the 
National Academy of Sciences, 1977)</p> <strong>Top of Page</strong> <strong>

<p> <strong>ECZEMA</strong></p> 
<p>Prof. Tamura Tatsuji, Keifuku Rehabilitation Center</p> 
<p>Eczema is used to describe several varieties of skin conditions, which have 
a number of common features. The exact causes of eczema are not fully 
understood. In many cases, eczema can be attributed to external irritants.</p> 
<p>Let me introduce a patient who recovered from skin disease after consuming 
the ionized water. This patient suffered 10 years of eczema and could not be 
cured effectively even under specialist treatment. This patient, who is 70 
years of age, is the President of a vehicle parts company. After the war, his 
lower limbs suffered acute eczema, which later became chronic. He was 
repeatedly treated in a specialist skin hospital.</p> 
<p>The left limb responded well to treatment, but not so the right limb. He 
suffered severe itchiness, which, when scratched, led to bleeding. During the 
last 10 years, he was seen and treated by many doctors. When I first examined 
him, his lower limb around the joints was covered with vesicles. Weeping 
occurred owing to serum exuding from the vesicles.</p> 
<p>I advised him to try consuming ionized water. He bought a unit and consumed 
the ionized water religiously and used the acidic water to bathe the affected 
areas. After 2 weeks of treatment the vesicles dried up. The eczema was 
completely cleared without any relapse after 1 1/2 months.</p> <strong>Top of

<p> <strong>ALLERGY</strong></p> 
<p>Prof. Kuninaka Hironaga, Head of Kuninaka-Hospital</p> 
<p>Mr. Yamada, the head of Police Research Institute, suffered from severe 
allergy. He was treated repeatedly by skin specialist, but with no success. 
Then he started consuming ionized water. The allergy responded very well and 
was soon completely cured. No relapse had occurred, although he had taken all 
kinds of food. He was most grateful and excited about this treatment.</p> 
<p>As for myself, I had also suffered severe allergy. Ever since I began to 
consume ionized water, the allergy has recovered. Since then, I started 
research on the effectiveness of ionized water.</p> 
<p>I discovered that most allergies are due to acidification of body condition 
and are also related to consuming too much meat and sugar. In every allergy 
case, the patient's antioxidant minerals are excessively low, which in turn 
lowers the body resistance significantly. The body becomes overly sensitive and 
develops allergy easily. To stabilize the sensitivity, calcium solution is 
injected into the vein. Therefore, it is clear that the ionized water--that has 
ionic calcium -- can help alleviate allergy.</p> 
<p>The ionic calcium not only enhances the heart, urination, and 
neutralization of toxins but controls acidity. It also enhances the digestive 
system and liver function. It will promote natural healing power and hence 
increase resistance to allergy. Some special cases of illness, which do not 
respond to drugs, are found to respond well to ionized water.</p> <strong>Top

<p><strong>GOUT and GENERAL HEALTH</strong><br>
 Dr. Gerry Brady</p> 
<p>I have practiced Medicine for 27 years and currently I practice exclusively 
in adult medicine in the CBD of Brisbane. I have a very broad experience of 
Medicine, also having founded one of Australia's most successful Biotechnology 
companies, Progen Industries.</p> 
<p>However, my great passion for Italian wine and Italian mineral water 
recently led me to investigate the pH and minerality of wine which, in turn, 
led me to the pH and minerality of water (as wine is principally water). After 
this investigation, I became interested in Alkaline water and then I began 
using a water ionizer about 5 weeks ago. Let me tell you what has happened to 
me personally since using a water ionizer.</p> My Plantar Fasciitis has 
disappeared (pain in the feet in the mornings) <br>
 My Gout has disappeared 
<br>  A long standing seborrheic keratosis on my forehead has stripped off 
spontaneously (present for 3 years and resistant to any attempts to pick it off)
<br> My aerobic capacity has improved ++ <br>
 My bowel motions have turned to 
a much lighter colour <br>
 I have become more sleepy at night and sleep 
&quot;like a baby&quot;, waking energized. <br>
My body's peripheral tissues 
(including my brain) initially felt they were &quot;zinging&quot; and 
&quot;superhydrated&quot; <br>
 My energy levels are improved overall. And some 
people who know me well have even said that my grey hair has darkened! <br>
<br>
<p>I am 50 years old. Almost all of these effects occurred soon after using 
Alkaline Water.</p> <strong>Top of Page</strong> <strong>Order</strong> <strong>

<p> <strong>DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS</strong></p> 
<p>Prof. Kogure Keizou, Kogure Clinic of Juntendo Hospital</p> 
<p>The stomach is readily upset both by diseases affecting the stomach and by 
other general illnesses. In addition, any nervous tension or anxiety frequently 
causes gastric upset.</p> 
<p>The important role of ionized water in our stomach is to neutralize the 
secretion and strengthen its functions. Usually, after consuming the ionized 
water for 1 to 3 minutes, the gastric juice increases to 1 1/2 times. For those 
suffering from achlorhydria (low in gastric juice ) the presence of ionized 
water will stimulate the stomach cells to secrete more gastric juice. This in 
turn enhances digestion and absorption of minerals.</p> 
<p>However, on the other hand, those with hyperchlorhydria (high in gastric 
juice), the ionized water neutralizes the excessive gastric juice. Hence, it 
does not create any adverse reaction.</p> 
<p>According to the medical lecturer from Maeba University, the pH of the 
gastric secretion will still remain normal when ionized water is consumed. This 
proves the ability of ionized water to neutralize as well as to stimulate the 
secretion.</p> <strong>Top of Page</strong> <strong>Order</strong> <strong>FAQ

<p> <strong>DIABETES</strong></p> 
<p>Dr. Robert O. Young: Television interview on Alkalinity and Diabetes. Click 
 here for windows media player video.</p> 
<p>Prof. Kuwata Keijiroo, Doctor of Medicine:</p> 
<p>When I was serving in the Fire Insurance Association, I used to examine 
many diabetic patients. Besides treating them with drugs, I provided them with 
ionized water. After drinking ionized water for one month, 15 diabetic patients 
were selected and sent to Tokyo University for further test and observations.
</p> 
<p>Initially, the more serious patients were a bit apprehensive about the 
treatment. When the ionized water was consumed for some time, the sugar in the 
blood and urine ranged from a ratio of 300 mg/l to 2 mg/ dc. There was a time 
where the patient had undergone 5 to 6 blood tests a day and detected to be 
within normal range. Results also showed that even 1 1/2 hour after meals, the 
blood sugar and urine ratio was 100 mg/dc 0 mg/dc. The sugar in the urine has 
completely disappeared.</p> 
<p> <strong>CANCER</strong></p> 
<p>&quot;I was diagnosed with Lukemia CLL. White cell went up from 11,000 to 
124,000 red cell 4.4 went down to 3.4 when I started drinking alkaline water in 
July 09. Three months later white cell went down to 113,000; red cells went 
back to 4, also lost 25 lbs. I love this water.&quot; L. Fiore, Quebec.</p> 
<p>&quot;I had breast cancer 2 years ago. I had surgery ans was advised by the 
doctor to take radiation etc. I would not take it (but with God's help) and 
changing my diet (no cured meats or pork) and this wonderful water I drink from 
my machine I have no more signs of cancer in my body. The cancer doctor is 
amazed. The acid water is excellent for any skin problems and house 
plants.&quot; Cora E., BC</p> 
<p>&quot;I have CLL Leukemia. Since drinking the water I have more energy, 
better sleep and I lost weight. My hair and nails grow faster and nicer. My 
health is stable and so is my weight loss. Even my cats drink the water. Thank 
you from the bottom of my heart. My life is a lot better.&quot; Leonard F., QC

<p> <strong>OBESITY</strong></p> 
<p>Prof. Hatori Tasutaroo, Head of Akajiuiji Blood Centre, Yokohama Hospital, 
Faitama District</p> 
<p>Due to a higher standard of living, our eating habits have changed. We 
consume too much proteins, fats and sugar. The excess fats and carbohydrates 
are in the body as fats. In the present lifestyles, Americans are more 
extravagant in food compared to the Japanese. Due to this excessive intake, 
obesity is a significant problem. Normally, one out of five males and one out 
of four females is obese.</p> 
<p>The degree of &quot;burn-out&quot; in food intake largely depends on the 
amount on intake of vitamins and minerals. When excessive intake of proteins, 
carbohydrates and fats occurs, the requirement for vitamins and minerals 
increases. However, there is not much research carried out pertaining to the 
importance of vitamins and minerals.</p> 
<p>Nowadays, many people suffer from acidification that leads to diabetes, 
heart diseases, cancer, live and kidney diseases. If our food intake can be 
completely burned off, then there is no deposition of fats. Obviously, there 
will be no acidification problem and hence there should not be any sign of 
obesity.</p> 
<p>The ionized water contains an abundance of ionic calcium. This ionic 
calcium helps in the &quot;burn-off&quot; process. By drinking ionized water, 
it provides sufficient minerals for our body. As a result, we do not need to 
watch our diet to stay slim.</p> 
<p>Hence, ionized water is a savior for those differing from obesity and many 
adult diseases, providing good assistance in enhancing good health.</p>
