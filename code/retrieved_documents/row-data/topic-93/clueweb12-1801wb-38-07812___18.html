<h3>Filtered Tap Water, It&rsquo;s Not Just About Taste</h3> Tuesday, February 
28th, 2012 
<p>Even if you live in a city with a trusted public utility and water that 
tastes great right out of the tap,&nbsp;using a&nbsp;home&nbsp;water filter for 
drinking and cooking&nbsp;is a smart move for the health of your family.</p> 
<p>In the one of most comprehensive analyses of public drinking water utilities
 available, the non-profit Environmental Working Group ranked performance and 
safety of the utility and water supplies in America&rsquo;s big cities (250,000 
or more inhabitants). Even top ranked Arlington, TX had 15 different pollutants 
present in drinking water and exceeded health targets for 4 during the 
monitoring period. Lowest performing Pensacola, FL reported the presence of 45 
pollutants and exceeded health guidelines for 21 of them.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act regulates acceptable levels of 91 
chemicals that might come out of your kitchen faucet. However, there are more 
than 60,000 chemicals in use in the United States. Getting a chemical onto the 
SDWA list can take years of review, aswe&rsquo;ve seen with chromium-6, which 
has been underreview by the Environmental Protection Agency since 2008. In the 
mean time,more and more communities have discovered this potentially 
cancer-causing chemical in their water supply.</p> 
<p>According to EPA, common sources of drinking water pollution may be 
human-caused or naturally-occurring and include the following:</p> 
<p><strong>Naturally Occurring</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Human Activities</strong></p> <br>

<p>&middot; microorganisms from wildlife and soils</p> 
<p>&middot; radionuclides from underlying rock</p> 
<p>&middot; nitrates and nitrites from nitrogen compounds in the soil</p> 
<p>&middot; heavy metals from underground rocks containing </p> 
<p>o arsenic,</p> 
<p>o cadmium,</p> 
<p>o chromium,</p> 
<p>o lead, and</p> 
<p>o selenium</p> 
<p>&middot; fluoride. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&middot; bacteria and nitrates from human and animal wastes&mdash;septic 
tanks and large farms</p> 
<p>&middot; heavy metals from mining construction or older fruit orchards that 
used heavy metal pesticides</p> 
<p>&middot; fertilizers and pesticides used on crops or lawns</p> 
<p>&middot; industrial products and wastes from</p> 
<p>o local factories</p> 
<p>o industrial plants</p> 
<p>o gas stations</p> 
<p>o dry cleaners</p> 
<p>o leaking underground storage tanks</p> 
<p>o landfills, and </p> 
<p>o waste dumps</p> 
<p>&middot; household wastes, including </p> 
<p>o cleaning solvents</p> 
<p>o used motor oil</p> 
<p>o paint</p> 
<p>o paint thinner and more</p> 
<p>&middot; lead and copper from household plumbing materials</p> 
<p>&middot; water treatment chemicals, including chlorine and chlorine 
byproducts</p> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>To find out exactly what contaminants may be present in your water, you can 
contact your public water utility, which is required to publish an annual 
report for you, or consult theEnvironment Working Group tap water database.</p>

<h3>19% of US Drinking Wells Contaminated According To USGS Study</h3> 
Thursday, October 13th, 2011 
<p>For the first time a national study has been conducted testing for 
potential trace contaminants in wells and aquifers. Conducted by the United 
States Geological Survey, it was found that overall 19 percent of the 5,183 
tested untreated public, private and monitoring wells exceeded health-based 
safety standards. When private drinking water wells were removed from the data 
set, it was found that a surprising&nbsp;13 percent of all private wells 
exceeded the health standards or guidelines. As a&nbsp;result, the report
recommends&nbsp;homeowners consider purchasing ahome water filter to purify 
their drinking water to protect themselves from these trace 
contaminants.&nbsp;According&nbsp;to the study, the estimate of those 
potentially at risk are 6.5 Million households, or approximately 26 Million 
people!</p> 
<p>A total of 20 trace elements were monitored in the study. The three that 
were shown to have the highest levels wereArsenic, Radon, and Manganese. These 
were not isolated to a couple regions, but rather found to be persistent 
nationwide stating, &ldquo;Wells with human health benchmark exceedances were 
widespread across the United States; they occurred in all aquifer groups and in 
both humid and dry regions.&rdquo; &nbsp;A copy of the study can be foundhere.
</p> 
<p>The wells that were found to be most at risk were the private wells used by 
homeowners. This is due to the fact that these wells are not monitored by any 
agency and are not regulated. It is the homeowners responsibility to keep tabs 
on the water quality and for many reasons this is not commonly done. As a 
result, an increased amount of contaminants and health effecting trace minerals 
have seeped into these wells unnoticed.</p> 
<h2>Arsenic Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Arsenic:</p> 
<p>Arsenic Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>According to the EPA website on the dangers of arsenic, &nbsp;&rdquo;
Non-cancer effects can include thickening and discoloration of the skin, 
stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; diarrhea; numbness in hands and feet; partial 
paralysis; and blindness. Arsenic has been linked to cancer of the bladder, 
lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver, and prostate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Joseph Ayotte, one of the researchers and a hydrologist with the U.S.G.S. 
states&nbsp;&rdquo;It was a bit surprising how many of these trace elements had 
exceedances of human health benchmarks, especially compared to other 
contaminants we are often concerned about. The findings certainly underscore 
the message we hear from the public health agencies, that everyone should test 
their wells for a suite of trace elements.&rdquo;<em>For interested customers, 
the Berkey PF-2 filters are used inside the lower chamber of our home water 
filter system for removing arsenic from the water.</em></p> 
<h2>Radon Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Radon:</p> 
<p>Radon Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>According to the EPA website on Radon; &ldquo;Radon in water is only a 
concern if your drinking water comes from underground, such as a well that 
pumps water from an aquifer.Breathing radon in indoor air can cause lung 
cancer. Radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in 
your lungs when you breathe it.. ..radon in indoor air is the second leading 
cause of lung cancer.&rdquo; This statement directly&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;to 
the radon dangers this study has found.</p> 
<p>Joseph Ayotte makes another statement many should pay heed to. He states, 
&ldquo;We often get more upset about these anthropogenic contaminants but we 
have to remember that these naturally occurring elements are often times more 
of a widespread problem. Not to diminish the importance of the others, but 
trace elements are also hugely important and arguably more so.&rdquo; 
&nbsp;This is in large portion due to the fact that these trace elements build 
up in the body over time and can cause a slow degradation of health. This can 
be more dangerous as an individual can experience a slow growing health issue 
over many years. That individual and their doctor may struggle to isolate the 
root cause and not recognize that it could be&nbsp;harmful&nbsp;trace elements 
from their own well water. With this many Americans potentially at risk, we 
also&nbsp;strongly advocate that home owners take the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;steps 
to test their wells on a yearly basis. We also&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;a home water 
filter like the berkey to remove these harmful trace elements from the water.
</p> 
<p>One additional&nbsp;poignant&nbsp;USGS statement was that harmful elements 
&ldquo;far outpace&rdquo; other pollutants, many of which get far more public 
attention. Based on previous USGS research, this 19 percent of wells that were 
discovered in this study compare with 7 percent of wells contaminated with 
nitrates and 1 to 2 percent for pesticides and volatile organic compounds.</p> 
<h2>Manganese Well&nbsp;Contamination</h2> 
<p>Here we show the study results in map form for Manganese:</p> 
<p>Manganese Well Contamination Levels</p> 
<p>The EPA does not have primary health risks&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with 
Manganese, rather they set secondary standards due to impacts 
&ldquo;such&nbsp;as the corrosion of iron and copper, may stain household 
fixtures, and impart objectionable metallic taste and red or blue-green color 
to the water supply as well. Corrosion of distribution system pipes can reduce 
water flow.&rdquo; &nbsp;Manganese can have a &ldquo;black to brown color; 
black staining; bitter metallic taste&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Protection With a Home Water Filter</h2> 
<p>The primary question we have to ask ourselves is:&nbsp;<strong>How have 
these concentrations gotten so high putting so many US citizens at risk, and 
how does one protect their family?</strong>There are two primary causes for 
these major well changes; natural&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;evolution / groundwater 
age, and pollution.</p> 
<p>The&nbsp;geochemistry&nbsp;of groundwater changes in time due to the 
contact with it&rsquo;s aquifer materials. This constant change and reactions 
with minerals is considered&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;evolution. Basically, the longer 
the water has been in contact with the aquifer, the 
more&nbsp;chemically&nbsp;evolved it is deemed to be and thus the greater 
concentrations of these trace minerals, some of which are harmful to the body 
such as arsenic and radon. Not stressed enough in this report is the fact that 
the study analysis is based on NAWQA (National Water-Quality Assessment) 
Program data collected from 1992 to 2003.&nbsp;Given the statements in the 
report and prior historical data, our feeling is that these harmful levels have 
most likely inclined, not declined since this data was collected.</p> 
<p>In addition, while not discussed nor a focus of the USGS study, a major and 
still growing problem is pollution.&nbsp;As our lands continue to be treated 
with fertilizers and chemicals, in concert with&nbsp;continued&nbsp;land 
development, population growth, and industry pollution we experience an ever 
increasing trickling of&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;waste into our groundwater systems 
and waterways. Many of these chemicals seep and soak through the sediment 
impacting our wells directly. However, they also contaminate the wells 
indirectly by surface water runoff flowing into the underground waterway 
systems and&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;finding&nbsp;their&nbsp;resting spots in 
karsts and water aquifers that these wells feed off of.&nbsp;The reality is 
that has been a growing problem&nbsp;for decades now.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve stressed 
the importance of&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;of karsts before as most folks do not 
realize that once these groundwater supplies are contaminated naturally or by 
human pollution, it is very difficult and expensive to reverse the condition. 
Regardless, protection with a home water filter is essential for homeowners 
whose wells have been&nbsp;compromised&nbsp;by these harmful trace minerals 
or&nbsp;chemical&nbsp;pollutants.</p>

<h3>Outdated Water Infrastructures May Be A Health Hazard</h3> Thursday, 
September 30th, 2010 
<p>Water treatment plants are charged with keeping our water free of bacteria, 
poisonous chemicals, parasites and other waterborne toxins. However, keeping 
facilities manned, maintained and up to date is not cheap and requires 
substantial taxpayer dollars. Even in communities with state of the art 
treatment facilities, the infrastructure that connects these facilities to 
homes, businesses, and schools is often in dire need of repair and maintenance.
</p> 
<p>Extreme rainfall can deluge sewage systems, especially those systems that 
are called upon to manage both waste water and storm water runoff. Storm water 
and wastewater can then mix and overflow, ultimately resulting in contaminated 
drinking water.</p> 
<p>The problem is further complicated by limited taxpayer dollars set to the 
backdrop of towns and states facing major budget shortfalls. In Pittsburgh for 
example, officials are debating over how to fund needed updates to both their 
water treatment facilities and maintenance of sewer lines which were installed 
in 1912.</p> 
<p>The condition of infrastructure in Pennsylvania and across the nation has 
been in the spotlight as federal stimulus dollars begin to dry up. The 2010 
Report Card recently released by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave 
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s water and waste water management systems failing grades. 
Local governments are looking to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s H2O funding 
announcements to help cover a small portion, but it is estimated that more than 
$25 billion will be required. Meanwhile, as this gets worked out, the risks to 
your health ever increase without a home water filter.</p> 
<p>The results of a recent study indicate that it may not even take a severe 
rain event to cause contamination of tap water. Dr. Marc Gorelick, chief of 
pediatric emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, led a group 
of researchers that studied the incidence of illnesses following rainfall.</p> 
<p>The study reviewed data detailing the number of emergency room visits by 
children due to gastroenteritis or diarrhea. Children were studied because 
they, along with the elderly and those in poor health, are the first ones to 
become ill following an assault upon their immune systems. Researchers found 
that the average number of emergency room visits increased by 11 percent for 
four days after any amount of rainfall. The study concluded that the incidence 
of waterborne illnesses occur more frequently even after comparatively mild 
rain events.</p> 
<p>Study collaborator Sandra McLellan is a senior scientist at the University 
of Wisconsin - Milwaukee&rsquo;s Great Lakes W.A.T.E.R. Institute (Wisconsin 
Aquatic Technology and Environmental Research). According to McLellan, water 
leaving Milwaukee&rsquo;s treatment plant is very high quality. Dr. Gorelick 
stated that the mystery &ldquo;is what happens to water between the time it 
leaves the treatment plant and gets to your tap.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The answer to that mystery likely lies in an aging infrastructure of pipes 
used to transport water. These pipes are kept under pressure and are designed 
to keep contaminants out of the treated water. However, this pressure can fail 
after a water main break results in a breach. This can also be an issue after 
rainfall saturates the surrounding soil, allowing contaminated water to leach 
into the piping system. In this way, even moderate rainfall or water events can 
contribute to drinking water contamination.</p> 
<p>These variables affect water after it leaves the treatment plant and makes 
it difficult to guarantee that water exiting the tap will be consistently safe. 
For this reason, spending the time and resources finding ahome water filter 
should be a top priority.</p>

<h3>Home Water Filters Take The Worry Away</h3> Thursday, February 4th, 2010 
<p>Every time you turn on the tap at home, chances are you find yourself 
wondering just what is in your water. Unsavory chemicals like chlorine, 
unwanted additives like fluoride, and a host of microscopic bacteria can seep 
into every glass. It&rsquo;s become an all to often event to read frightening 
headlines about just what has been found in the public water supply.</p> 
<p>When it&rsquo;s time to enjoy peace of mind, home water filters can 
deliver. When the right system is selected, you will enjoy cleaner, safer water 
without having to spend a fortune in the process.</p> 
<p>The Berkey home water filter system is favored from the British Royal house 
to Peace Corp camps around the world for very good reasons. Our water filters 
remove the things in your water that you don&rsquo;t want without stripping out 
the vital minerals your body needs.</p> 
<p>The gravity water filters we offer are designed to get rid of a number of 
major concerns in public drinking water. They are highly effective at removing 
such things as cysts, parasites, and harmful pathogens (to 99.99999%), while 
also removing many unwanted chemicals and contaminants to undetectable levels. 
Berkey water filter systems also significantly reduce the fluoride and arsenic 
levels in your water via the PF line of filters.</p> 
<p>When the right home water filter system is used, you can be assured of 
several things every time you pour a glass of water for a family member. These 
include:</p> 
<p><strong>Enjoying better tasting water</strong> &ndash; Chlorine and other 
additives placed into public water supplies can give water a funny flavor that 
bothers many. When home water filters are used to get rid of the chemicals, the 
only taste left behind is pure, clean water. In addition to making drinks taste 
better, the removal of chemicals is also fantastic for the flavors of dishes 
cooked with water in the mix.</p> 
<p><strong>Gaining peace of mind</strong> &ndash; There is something very 
comforting about knowing an effective home water filter system is on the job. 
With harmful bacteria found even in municipal drinking water systems, you can 
never be too safe. The right water filters will remove any worries and concerns 
associated with grabbing water straight out of your tap.</p> 
<p><strong>Getting your money&rsquo;s worth</strong> &ndash; Some home water 
filters cost a small fortune to put into operation. The Berkey system does not. 
Our water costs about 1.7 cents a gallon. Plus, the Berkey home water filter 
system does not depend on electricity to function and it is fully portable. 
This means it can be counted on to deliver safe, clean water even during power 
outages. It can also be taken on the road during camping trips and more.</p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are on a well or have city water, 
turning on the tap can sometimes be a crap-shoot. If you&rsquo;re ready to stop 
worrying about what is in your water and start enjoying a cleaner taste, then 
picking the right home water filter system is a great investment. Berkey water 
delivers the performance you&rsquo;re after, at the prices you can afford.</p>

<h3>Berkey Home Water Filters - Higher Quality for Less Money</h3> Saturday, 
November 7th, 2009 
<p>The general public is slowly beginning to understand that our water supply 
has been compromised.&nbsp; Whether it be our well water that is being affected 
by general pollution, or our municipal water that is being heavily treated with 
disinfectants, our water is not as pure and pristine as we would hope.&nbsp; In 
response, much of the population has turned to bottled water and home water 
filters.&nbsp; Unfortunately, bottled water adds to pollution, it can get 
expensive, and in some cases is simply municipal water that&rsquo;s been 
bottled in a city like Atlanta.&nbsp; When it comes to home water filters, all 
water filter systems are not created equal.&nbsp; Many of the most popular 
water filters on the market remove or reduce some chemicals and contaminants, 
but leave gaping holes for other contaminants to pass through to our drinking 
glass.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my lasthome water filter post, I will be 
evaluating many of the other water filter solutions on the market over the next 
couple months, but would like to begin this journey comparing the berkey water 
filter against the models; Aquasana, Pur, and Brita.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll call 
them the big three.</p> 
<h2>The High Quality of the Black Berkey Filter</h2> 
<p>It seems nowadays health is a topic of conversation on everybody&rsquo;s 
mind.&nbsp; The nutritional supplement and organic foods markets continue to 
grow by double digits year over year and is a testament to the customer&rsquo;s 
search for higher quality and better health.&nbsp; Water filtration seems to be 
slightly behind this awareness curve and is most likely due in large part to 
the public just recently coming to terms with what&rsquo;s really happening 
with our water supply.&nbsp; Just turn on the TV or go out on the internet and 
you&rsquo;ll see some other type of contaminant or chemical that&rsquo;s now 
being found in our drinking water.</p> 
<p>The big three of Pur, Aquasana, and Brita are decent at filtering out some 
of the more well known disinfectants such as chlorine, but they do so only at 
ranges between 96-99%.&nbsp; Comparably, berkey water filters remove chlorine 
to beyond detectable levels.&nbsp; The Berkey also reduces heavy metals such as 
aluminum and lead, removes pathogenic bacteria and E-coli, nitrates and 
nitrites, and radon.&nbsp; The other water filters fail to address these 
contaminants and instead pass them through to your drinking glass 
completely.&nbsp; Even when it comes to very dangerous VOC&rsquo;s and 
THM&rsquo;s, that have been shown to have correlations to increases in 
illnesses such as cancer, only Aquasana and Pur have some impact at the 98-99% 
level.&nbsp; Yet these levels are well below the reduction levels of the Berkey 
which reduces both VOC&rsquo;s and THM&rsquo;s to beyond detectable 
limits.&nbsp; Finally, it&rsquo;s important to note that one of the fastest 
growing water concerns of the public is the fluoridation, or the addition of 
fluoride, to our municipal water supplies.&nbsp; Again, none of the big three 
water filters address fluoride.&nbsp; Conversely, Berkey systems have an add-on 
filter option for theblack berkey filter elements called the PF-2 filter that 
specifically targets both fluoride and arsenic to reduce it by over 99.75%.</p> 
<h2>Save Money When You Buy a Berkey Home Water Filter</h2> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anyone in the US or Canada that 
hasn&rsquo;t been impacted by the economic depression.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a 
tough couple years, and while wall street and the government talk about a 
recovery underway, many of us on main street simply don&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; 
Every decision we make needs to be one that maximizes that value of our hard 
earned dollar.&nbsp; That leaves many of us spending our time trying to 
determine how to get the highest quality the for the least amount of 
money.&nbsp; When it comes to water filtration, if you start to do the math, 
Aquasana, Pur, and Brita are simply not the most cost effective.&nbsp; A 
one-time investment in a standard Berkey home water filter such as theBerkey 
Light or the Big Berkey will cost the consumer $209 or $250 respectively, and 
provide at least 5 years of high quality filtration.&nbsp; Comparably, the big 
three require many filter replacements across this 5 year period and result in 
a total cost ranging between $560 and $658.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s more than twice 
the cost for inferior water filtration.&nbsp; Even when the Berkey secondary 
fluoride filters are added on, the black berkey / PF-2 combination is still 
cheaper.&nbsp; (chart below)&nbsp; Addt&rsquo;l details can be found atberkey

<h3>Dr Oz on Home Water Filters</h3> Saturday, October 24th, 2009 
<p>Just recently on Oct. 20th, 2009, Dr Oz did a segment on water quality 
showcasing some options for filtering your water.&nbsp; This is a great primer 
for understanding why home water filters, including a qualityshower filter, are 
critical for the health of you and your family.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Home Water Filters Comparison</h2> 
<p>Given this is only a 7 minute segment, Dr Oz is unable to explore in detail 
some of the other water filtration solutions on the market.&nbsp; He covers 
filters representative of top consumer brands such as Pur, Aquasana, and 
Reverse Osmosis.&nbsp; While these are qualitywater filters, they do lack some 
filtration capabilities, and their yearly costs are significantly higher than a 
basic Berkey water filter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and created aberkey 
water filter comparison chart to stack up some of the more common and highly 
advertised water filters such as Pur, Aquasana, and Brita filters to our own 
Berkey filter.&nbsp; In a follow-up post, I will go into a more detailed 
analysis on this comparison.</p>
