<h1>Should You Use Natural Seawater In Your Aquarium</h1>

<p>It seems very reasonable doesn&rsquo;t it. We keep seawater aquariums and 
so why not put [tag-tec]natural seawater[/tag-tec] in them. It saves money too, 
no more buying those expensive buckets of dry salt mix.</p> 
<p>The first consideration is availability. Seawater is heavy, around 10lbs 
per gallon. If the aquarium is fairly large the amount required will be many 
gallons, much more if it is an initial fill. Lots of large containers, all 
suitably safe for seawater, plus a vehicle that can safely transport the bulk 
and weight. Most aquarists live away from the sea, and the dry salt mix is the 
obvious way to go.<br>

<p>What a joke. You were completely biased from the start. Clearly you are 
against NSW so why write the article? 1,000 litre container, a generator and a 
bilge pump and I can collect a tonne of seawater at a time without any issues. 
That will last me several months. The initial cost to buy the above is 
negligible compared to artificial salt + RODI fresh.</p> </li> 
<li> John on March 17th, 2008 6:02 pm 
<p>No, Jim! I&rsquo;m not against NSW. After all, this is what Mother Nature 
provides. It follows, therefore, that it should be ok for captive reefs.<br>
 I 
wrote the text from the perspective of the majority of aquarists. They have to 
get to the sea, collect, and transport. Unfortunately, there is the real 
question of pollution for many.<br>
 Clearly you have the access, the seawater 
quality, the equipment and transportation availability for collection. 1000 
litres is a lot of seawater, and a lot of weight. How many can 
collect/transport that?<br>
 I tried to look at the potential practical 
problems that would be faced. Seawater that is clean, can be collected and 
stored safely is an option to a few &ndash; and in the past some public 
aquariums did this, but some now use salt (no doubt at a considerable discount).

<p>Well, I am not very near to the sea, but I took the efforts to try natural 
sea water!<br>
 I have my main tank with synthetic salt water which is doing 
great, but some thing was lacking out there.<br>
 To experiment I set up a 
small tank and used natural sea water, it was just filtered for large particles 
and then dumped it the new clean tank, with no sand, no skimmer, etc.<br>
 It 
had only a basic power head for circulation.<br>
 It was a total success. I put 
some of my existing corals in it, and they were never as the were in my main 
tank, they sensitive types appeared to be 
hardy&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
 The results were great 
color, more than full polyp extension, fast growth, etc.<br>
 This was observed 
for a year, and the temp tank has out grown its capacity of coral housing 
without any new addition!<br>
 The natural sea water was replaced every three 
weeks.<br>
 I think, synthetic salts formulas lack something untraceable, which 
makes the difference&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
 The natural seawater 
is as wonder, wish it could flow in my taps!</p> </li> 
<li> John on April 2nd, 2008 5:11 pm 
<p>Hi Sam.<br>
 Now that&rsquo;s very interesting! I wonder how many have done 
what you did, and run NSW against synthetic. Often that&rsquo;s how we advance, 
with trial and error on this and that.<br>
 There is no doubt that Mother 
Nature&rsquo;s product is best, provided it hasn&rsquo;t been tainted by 
humankind. One &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; salt manufacturer obtains salt from the 
Red Sea, by evaporating the liquid. Probably not quite as straightforward as 
that!<br>
 However, the fact remains that most aquarists don&rsquo;t have the 
storage and transportation (and/or the will?) to go to the sea or ocean.<br>
 I 
wonder what made your corals happier? Perhaps the synthetic mixes are too 
chemically &lsquo;harsh&rsquo;? Must say though that in my soft coral tank my 
main problem is overgrowth.<br>
 Great to read of experiments such as this. 
Though anecdotal, they cause questions, which can only be good.</p> </li>

<p>I had always heard one side of this debate &ndash; that natural sea water 
is plagued with parasites and pollution &ndash; until I visited my now-local 
fish shop. This guy has the most beautiful coral collections I have ever seen. 
Vibrant SPS like nothing I had seen in pictures, healthy fish, all around great 
success. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I&rsquo;m in the process of converting my 
fish-only setup now! Can&rsquo;t wait to try it with corals</p> </li>

<p>Believe or not, i live in Mauritius, a tropical island in the indian ocean 
for those who don&rsquo;t know and I have owned an aquarium all my life. The 
funny thing is that I have always spent huge sum of money buying all kinds of 
plants, imported fishes, etc for fresh water fishes until fairly recently, i 
asked myself why not try sea water fishes.</p> 
<p>So, sea water is readily available and I have a wide variety of fishes that 
I can fish myself by the seaside, not mentioning that all that is free of cost. 
Sea water fishes are wild, i have no idea which is the predator or which one 
only feeds on seaweeds but I am learning fast from watching it live in my 
aquarium!! My small blue fishes kept disappearing one at a time when I finally 
spot the my red fish with huge eyes taking it all at one go! Apparently all red 
fishes are predators, and the huge eye was night hunting&hellip; I should have 
realised. Anyways, my concern is that, i don&rsquo;t know how to keep my 
aquarium filled with fresh sea water clean. It turns cloudy, slightly brownish 
after a week or so. I wonder whether it is my sea weeds which I think must be 
missing sunlight or the coral itself&hellip; Anyways, all this is new for me, i 
may have grown into an expert in fresh water fishes but still a novice in sea 
water fishes. Till now, I am simply exchanging 10L of water every other day to 
keep my aquarium clear.</p> </li>

<p>It would have been nice if this article could have explained more about 
actually using NSW vs RO Unit + Salt rather than just &ldquo;you have to lug it 
around&rdquo;, im sure people already know that.</p> 
<p>Sure mention that 1litre weighs around 1.024kg&hellip; but more would be 
nice.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly an expert (never tried it &ndash; hence why I am 
looking) but it seems obvious not to trust the quality near shore, so might be 
worth testing the water before you take some? And not to assume it will always 
be the same as surface run off and near river deltas can change it depending on 
the type of rain (acid rain and all them worries). Just like the people who 
collect rain water for their aquariums, we can&rsquo;t rely on it being the 
same from one day to another.</p> 
<p>Any other info would be brilliant.</p> 
<p>One thing I wondered &ndash; if you lived on the door step of the sea, 
assuming it was away from pollutant sites, could you constantly pump water 
(slowly, and assuming temperature matches fine) through your aquarium and have 
no need for any kind of filtration/skimming/etc? Sounds like a dream! </p> </li>
<li> John on April 5th, 2010 10:23 am 
<p>I&rsquo;m not against natural seawater at all. My attitude is that Mother 
Nature is in charge and knows best.</p> 
<p>I live by the sea (cold) but use synthetic. The reason for this is that I 
cannot trust the quality of the natural seawater (NSW). If I could by going 
offshore I don&rsquo;t have the transportation facility, even if I were to 
collect a small amount at a time.</p> 
<p>As I don&rsquo;t use NSW I can&rsquo;t really give opinions as to how it 
should be used. However, I do know of aquarists who use nothing else but NSW. 
They say that their method is the same as it would be for synthetic, that is 
they do the necessary routine seawater changes and also add any required 
supplement, for example calcium. Some find it strange that a supplement should 
be used with the natural stuff, but the same happens in the aquarium if there 
is a demand &ndash; it gets used up.</p> 
<p>The idea of slow-pumping NSW through an aquarium isn&rsquo;t new though no 
doubt it is hardly used in our hobbyist world. The public aquarium fairly close 
to me uses this method on their main tanks, though they have smaller tanks that 
are dealt with in the normal way. The seawater is collected well offshore then 
pumped through numerous filters which deal with large, small and miniscule 
debris and also hopefully remove any living nasties. The aquariums do seem to 
be doing well overall though there are losses from time to time. As a 
commercial enterprise cost will be high on the agenda so the power and 
filtration requirements will have been balanced against the cost of sysnthitic 
salt.</p> 
<p>To say again &ndash; if an aquarist is able to obtain clean natural 
seawater in sufficient quantity, in other words has the collection and 
transportation facilities then there isn&rsquo;t any reason why natural 
seawater shouldn&rsquo;t be used. However, I stand by the suggestion that 
synthetic seawater is the way to go for most marine aquarists on the basis that 
they aren&rsquo;t by the sea, or haven&rsquo;t the collection and/or 
transportation facilities.<br>

<li> Ray on October 28th, 2010 7:54 pm 
<p>This is such a great debate. I have always used synthetic salt mix. I was 
living in Virginia and NSW was not available to me. I have always wondered if 
NSW would be okay to use. Since then I have moved Florida. I now live by the 
beach. I was setting up my 125 gallon tank. It was a hard decision to go 
natural or continue using synthetic. Despite all the oppositions I had to try 
the NSW. I agree with John on one point! Obtaining the NSW is no easy feat! I 
had 2 pickup trucks, a trailer, 4 grown men, 30 &ndash; 5 gallon buckets. I 
found the most isolated spot away from fresh water run offs. Had to find the 
closest spot from beach to road. Once all of this was accomplished, It was then 
that the manual labor began. It took just around an hour with all of us working 
very hard. Once the water was loaded. Then the trip back home which wasnt that 
bad. 40 miles or so. Once I had them at the carport, 30 buckets being carried 
up a flight of stairs. I used a very fine neat to trap large particles and 
floating algae. Once the tank was full. I turned on 2 aqua clear 110&prime;s , 
1 eheim 2215, 2 power heads, 1 uv sterilizer and protein skimmer. You can 
immediately see the skimmer taking action with dirty crude from the water. for 
5 hours it was producing this dirt. Now its seems prett clean after 24 hours. 
The water is very clean. A tad bit cloudy yet but this even happens with 
synthetic mixtures. Okay My parameters are as follows: Ammonia 0, Nitrites 0, 
Nitrates 0, PH 8.4, phosphates 0. So far so good. I will continue to monitor 
the paramaters for several days. I do agree with others on here, What better to 
keep your fish than something natural. This is where they come from. Unless you 
have some industrial waste runoff or fresh water runoff, I dont see what the 
problem would be. Also some companies sell NSW for $15.00 to $20.00 dollars for 
2 gallon jugs. You do the math on that one. So lets see what happens but I have 
good feelings about this. I will post soon and let you guys know about my 
findings on my test!</p> </li> 
<li> John on October 29th, 2010 4:07 pm 
<p>Thanks very much for that Ray, very interesting. The &lsquo;Sunshine 
State&rsquo; eh, lucky you!</p> 
<p>As time goes on it will be good to know what happens. </p> 
<p>Much has been said about how well organisms do in NSW. The only things that 
I can think of that possibly could be the reason are that the 
manufacturer&rsquo;s oft made claim of &lsquo;indistinguishable from 
Nature&rsquo;s own&rsquo; is perhaps a bit over ambitious, and that synthetic 
seawater is &lsquo;harsh&rsquo; chemically, as opposed to mature superbly mixed 
NSW.</p> </li> 
<li> Ray on November 10th, 2010 8:54 pm 
<p>Hello Everyone! </p> 
<p> Im back to post some information on my findings. Its been 13 days since I 
set up my tank with NSW. I previously posted my parameters upon set up 2 weeks 
ago. on the second day of setup I noticed the tank was going through its diatom 
bloom. It promoted all the light brown film on the substrate. It is almost 
completely gone. Just a few little spots I see here and there. They are 
approximately dime to quarter size in diameter but very faint and hard to see. 
The water is crystal clear. I added fish also. 8 green chromis and 1 six line 
wrasse. G/F really wanted the six line wrasse. I was hestitant but gave in. I 
thought it would probably be okay but didnt want the little guy to persish if 
anything went wrong with the water parameters. So far so good. I have not 
noticed any stress on any of the fish. No irratical swimming or heaving 
breathing from any of the inhabitants. The proptein skimmer is still skimming a 
nice chunk of stuff but at a lower lolume than previously noted. The UV 
sterilizer has not been turned off since the start of the tank. I want to make 
sure that any bacteria gets treated with germicidal bulb. In 2 weeks im 
planning on turning it off once I add Live lock to help promote corraline 
algae. The water has been evaporating at a higher rate than im used to up 
north. Maybe its me but I have had to replace approximately 10 gallons of RO/DI 
water into the tank. I just top off the tank with the clean water NO SALT of 
coarse. This would be defeating my purpose of experimenting with NSW is I added 
a grain of synthetic. So, I took even more test today. Here is what my 
parameters are as of today:<br>
 Ammonia: 0<br>
 Nitrate: 0<br>
 Nitrite: 0<br>

 PH: 7.8 ( the PH is a tad low will be adding additive to increase)<br>
 
Calcium: 420 PPM ( I have not added anything to get this) perfect<br>
 
Magnesium: 1,250 (I have not added anything to get this) perfect<br>
 dKH: 12 
or 196.9 ( I have not added anything to get this) Perfect.</p> 
<p>As you can all see. It seems so far that using NSW from a good source can 
be extremely beneficial. I have all good parameters except for the PH which is 
any easy fix. Other than that its great. I have had a serious problem in the 
past keeping my calcium and some other elements in tact. Now seems if 
everything goes well. All I have to do is keep these parameters at these 
levels. John, I am starting to believe in your theory. I am thinking that what 
you mentioned previously is true about some trace element that is undetectable. 
I will continue to use NSW as long as the water is collected from a good 
source. Do your research, scout the areas before just jumping in any saltwater 
source. I used Google earth to be able to see if there were any fresh water 
runoffs on the area. I will let you guys know more about what happens in the 
next few weeks! Later everyone, Happy Reef and Saltwater Fish Keeping!</p> </li>
<li> John on November 12th, 2010 4:14 pm 
<p>Once again Ray&hellip;.thank you so much for that, there&rsquo;s not a 
great deal written for ordinary aquarists about NSW/artificial mixes.</p> 
<p>Your parameters are good (you&rsquo;re dealing with pH). The diatoms will 
have disappeared when the silicon ran out, it&rsquo;s pretty certain they 
won&rsquo;t return, at least at the original density.</p> 
<p>With routine seawater changes to &lsquo;freshen&rsquo; up the aquarium 
environment should remain good.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re adding to the minority of marine aquarists who use NSW and who 
report great results.</p> 
<p>If I may mention&hellip;.I agree totally that artificial salt must not be 
added in a procedure/test such as yours. However, watch for any SG drop caused 
by &lsquo;salt creep&rsquo;, though it could seem very minor it can have an 
effect over a period of time.</p> </li> 
<li> Jean on November 13th, 2010 1:04 pm 
<p>This new idea of having saltwater in our own aquariums is quite new and 
controversial. This is the type of topic that needs to be researched and 
studied to assure that species immersed in this kind of environment will be 
safe and healthy. If not,tropical freshwater aquarium can be an another option.
</p> </li> 
<li> John on November 13th, 2010 6:11 pm 
<p>Hi Jean.</p> 
<p>Saltwater aquariums aren&rsquo;t exactly a new idea, they&rsquo;ve been 
around for decades. They have now reached an advanced state &ndash; just have a 
look at some of the reef aquariums that can be seen on the internet. The 
ability of aquarists to maintain healthy marine aquariums has been proved 
beyond doubt, but there remains the need for newcomers to research and learn of 
course, and there will always be those that are more advanced and move the 
hobby forward.</p> </li> 
<li> terry on February 26th, 2011 12:26 pm 
<p>hello ray..</p> 
<p>are you still on here mate? iam from the east coast of england<br>
 ( uk ) 
ive just started up a marine tank.( 7weeks ago) was going to mix my own salt 
water when i decided to collect (N.S.W.) iam only 5mins from the beach!! they 
say that the north sea is dirty, well my tank is do great.!!</p> 
<p>i have an 800lt tank with a sump on the botton, with a protein skimmer, 
6500, ocean runner pump, and a seio, m2600 power head.</p> 
<p>when i filled the tank up i put in about 100kg of live rock, and lelf the 
power head running for two weeks, after two weeks i done a test, ammonia= 0.ppm
<br> p.h= 8.2<br>
 nitrite = 0.ppm<br>
 nitrate= 0.ppm</p> 
<p>done a test on week 3 the p.h= 8.4 ammonia =0.ppm, nitrite= 0.ppm, nitrate= 
0.ppm. ( i think its down to N.S.W.)</p> 
<p>on the 6/2/2011 i put in a sailfin tang with 2 cleaner shrimp.</p> 
<p>on the 13/2/2011 i put in two clown fish, i all so have a couple of star 
fish , and an hermit crab that have come of the live rock.</p> 
<p>everythink is do well, my water tests are still giveing the same reading, 
my salinity reading is (35ppt ) which is great. ive just done my first wate 
change with (N.S.W.) everythink is still great !!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve achieved what many who have used natural sea water (NSW) have 
reported &ndash; got great results! Goes to show that Mother Nature does it 
better. Sadly for most of us (including me) NSW is not practical to collect.<br>
 As I&rsquo;ve said before, the only thing that I can guess at as being the 
main difference is that Mother Nature&rsquo;s mix is very mature and contains 
all &ndash; maybe there&rsquo;s something in the seawater that analysts have 
not detected, though I doubt it.</p> </li> 
<li> Ray on February 27th, 2011 4:31 am 
<p>Hey Terry im still here. I wish i could post a picture or video of my feef 
tank! Its looking really good! I have even added a t.crocea clam that is doing 
fantastic. I am setting up another tank, i will be using nsw once again. The 
same routine as before. Gather nsw, filter the water with a fine net or mesh 
into the aquarium to collect debris. Turn on filters and uv sterilizer. MOST 
IMPORTANTLY, allow your tank to mature! No matter what anyone says! Using nsw 
doesnt give you a magical pass on cycling! It will be faster than mixes but you 
still nwwd for you tank to mature and develop that beneficial bacteria. Many 
may ask, so why use nsw if i still need ro cycle? First it will cycle faster! 
Second, i truly believe that there is an element that is in nsw that is lacking 
in synthetic. All of your fish, coral, inverts etc will thrive in the natural 
sea water! Terry please make sure that your water is cleaned in a calculated 
process through filtration and uv sterilization. Give it some time. Check your 
parameters frequently, not just the common thing but magnesium, calcium, iodine 
and such! You will notice that nsw will have all elements needed from the 
beginning! All you need rondo is maintain it! Hope this helps! Havent been on 
lately, been busy with work lol! Happy reef keeping everyone!</p> </li> 
<li> Peter on March 4th, 2011 1:43 pm 
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a 50gal that i use NSW and sand and live rock and corals and 
fish all collected from the same reef. Its has been working fine now for almost 
a year and the best part is that its all free. I can park pretty close to the 
water at a beach where i can look a mile in both directions and so nobody. I 
usually collect my aquarium stuff when i go spear fishing and get a pretty good 
work out from it. I prefer to catch my aquarium fish at night when i can walk 
through tidal pools and swim through the reef with a couple nets and a dive 
light(pelican) which i blind them with before abducting them. I also prefer the 
to be alone in the water at night time in the reef because you cant see behind 
you and you have no idea what is in the water with you and it adds an element 
of danger to a 2:00am adventure.</p> </li> 
<li> John on March 5th, 2011 6:36 pm 
<p>Hi Peter.<br>
 Now that&rsquo;s something different! It must be great to be 
near a wild reef and be able to collect everything you need. You&rsquo;ll be 
able to measure the exact seawater parameters if desired. The swimming on the 
reef whenever wanted must be wonderful though I&rsquo;m not sure about the 
2.00am bit. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to visit a lot of reefs in various parts 
of the world but live nowhere near one, the climate is warm to cold here.</p> 
</li> 
<li> Bruce on March 12th, 2011 6:31 pm 
<p>Great article- loved everyone&rsquo;s opinion&hellip;I also live in Florida 
on the water and am lucky to have a boat in the backyard and it takes me 10 min 
to get to &ldquo;deep blue&rdquo; water. I have a 80 gallon clean plastic 
container that I use to collect the water but my questions is this: what is the 
best and fastest way to to plumb it from there to the tank (about 50-60 yards)? 
I have been using just an old RIo pump and some garden hose but I figure 
someone out there has got a better way with a ball valve to turn it on and off 
as needed at the aquarium. Thanks in advance for any answers.<br>
 Bruce</p> 
</li> 
<li> Ray on March 13th, 2011 9:13 pm 
<p>Hey bruce, </p> 
<p> Sounds great having that access! We are fortunate wencan do this. I am 
assuming you want to put your resevoir of nsw connected to you aquarium display 
right? I think thats a great idea the problem would be the following: 1st the 
water wuld not be xlean entering your tank. The water should be cleaned by 
skimming, uv sterilization and filtration. 2nd, you can connect it in varies 
ways but remember, your tank water will evaporate, salt does not! So you will 
steadily increase your salinity/sg to a staggering elevation threw time! I 
would recommend a ro/do system with clean automatic top off! Take your 80 
gallon container and store your nsw. You can add a filtration system and uv 
sterilzer with power heads in it. Use it for you water changes instead! This 
will give you time to clean that water out completely and also have an 
unlimited amount of new fresh saltwater for your water changes! Hopes this 
helps bruce.</p> </li> 
<li> XIman on January 3rd, 2012 7:12 pm 
<p>There is no specific way we have to follow, i agree John fully, and agree 
others too since i live in the Maldives and been in this hobby for 12 years on 
and off. I always used NSW since there is no way i can purchase synthetic salt 
from my country. I have tried different ways, had water straight after 
collecting. It takes 5 mins to bring, and its clear unpolluted water most of 
the time. Also i do water changes by storing NSW by collecting and storing in 
plastic containers in the hope of killing off any nutrients that might be in 
it. Important thing is i have to level temperature and add freshwater to get 
the correct salinity levels.</p> 
<p>So from my experience, if i had the option to buy salt mix, i would use it 
for sure, WHY? coz i can never achieve the same quality, same condition, same 
levels in NSW ever ytime i do a water change, sometimes the water i collect 
have many nutrients and i have algae blooms, other times some other matter. And 
anyone who keeps sensitive corals knows that a change in water parameters does 
do a lot of harm to the corals, it might not show in show in short term, but in 
long term it affects the corals badly.</p> 
<p>So my bottom line is, NSW is great if you can afford to have it, free even 
though a lot of effort. At the same time salt mixes are great in the sense that 
i can know i can achieve the same parameters every time i do a water change. 
And for those who have differences in noticing coral growth and health of it, 
we cannot prove its because of NSW coz 99% of all famous and great reefkeepers 
use salt mix, so we cannot argue that.</p> 
<p>So all i have to say is we can never say NSW is bad coz its mother nature, 
but due to the factors i&rsquo;ve mentioned above, its not always the best 
choice for your corals due to the influence of other factors of mother nature. 
My corals might be doing great in NSW bcoz they are wild, not cultured. and if 
i had cultured corals in NSW it might affect badly too, i would love to hear 
comments from experts.</p> </li> 
<li> John on January 5th, 2012 10:37 am 
<p>Hello Xlman.<br>
 Thanks for your input. It&rsquo;s very interesting 
particularly as it comes from someone with a coral reef on their doorstep and 
an available NSW supply. I have to say that if I had uncontaminated NSW 
available I would definitely try it. The usual problems with NSW are first the 
major one &ndash; getting it (transport etc), then ensuring it is generally 
clean including pollution and, as you say, maintaining parameters (though the 
same problem with parameters can arise with manufactured salt).<br>
 I had the 
good fortune to visit the Maldives (the island was Kanifinolu, I&rsquo;ve 
probably mispelt it, sorry) and it was great snorkelling over the reef and just 
relaxing in general.</p> </li> 
<li> Koos on January 13th, 2012 6:44 pm 
<p>Hi. Can anyone tell me.Can I top up my Synthetic salt water Aquarium with 
NSW water?Your help will be appreciated.<br>
 Thanks Koos.</p> </li> 
<li> John on January 14th, 2012 3:43 pm 
<p>Hello Koos.<br>
 Yes you can. Make sure the NSW (natural seawater) is safe, 
that is not polluted, and at the same salinity as your aquarium seawater. If 
you&rsquo;ve been using a synthetic mix then it could be easier to slowly alter 
the synthetic mix in the aquarium to match the NSW (there are some who have 
reduced the salinity of the NSW if needed by carefully adding RO (reverse 
osmosis) water but this is creating work for the future that isn&rsquo;t 
necessary). To find out the NSW salinity it needs to be heated to the aquarium 
temperature first before the salinity is measured as temperature has an effect.
<br> If you are adding a very small amount of NSW (compared to the total 
aquarium seawater gallonage) then matching the seawater salinity isn&rsquo;t 
absolutely necessary though it should still be heated. The overall salinity 
will match over time. Changes should always be gradual.</p> </li>

<p>I have used sea water on my last 2 tanks. The tank was set up on synthetic 
and i vary the water change between natural sea water and salt. the reason for 
this is im still not brave enough to just use nsw i collect it from near the 
shore when the tide is coming in, i may have option in summer of collecting 
from deep.<br>
 Through this winter it was proving difficult to collect so i 
went back onto synthetic and i would have to say that my tank isnt doing half 
as well!!!</p> </li>

<p>Hello Dave.<br>
 Like so many others you report how well your system does 
with NSW. As you realise the greatest danger is pollution. Why systems do so 
well with NSW I cannot state categorically &ndash; but it seems to me Mother 
Nature&rsquo;s own is very mature and directly suitable, whereas synthetic 
mixes are more harsh even after mixing for 24 hours or so. Or maybe 
there&rsquo;s an ingredient in NSW that&rsquo;s not fully recognised for its 
importance, but I doubt that!</p> </li>

<p>Hello everyone! its been a while since ive been on here. Wanted to let 
everyone know that my tank is doing great. I stopped using NSW for a while and 
noticed a decline in my corals, Corraline algae and such. Started adding trace 
elements and dosing calcium but the tank is not doing as well as it was when i 
was using NSW. So this weekend its back to the beach. Seems that its harder for 
my tank to deplete all the elements found in nature rather than usuing man made 
stuff. Just thought Id share this with my fellow aquarist. Wish we could post 
pics on here to show you what I am meaning by all this. Frankly even the 
coloration of my fish have declined. They were much brighter before than they 
are now. For anyone intending to us this method of harvesting NSW &ldquo;DO NOT 
PUT IT STRAIGHT INTO YOUR TANK&rdquo;! I cannot express this enough! Get a 55 
Gallon Drum or Trash can, Place the water in there for at least 48 hours with a 
filter, Power head and if possible a UV sterilizer. Then use as water change 
water. You will be very happy eith results! Happy reefing everyone! send me a 
message from time to time I feel so not loved by you all! LOL my email is
xdeputy101@yahoo.com from Destin , Florida! talk to you guys later!</p> </li>

<p>Nice to hear again Ray. Agree with what you say about NSW being 
&lsquo;treated&rsquo; before it goes in the display aquarium. Despite the fact 
(I think I can call it fact?) that the natural stuff is best caution remains 
the rule.</p> </li> 
<li> Ray on February 6th, 2012 5:20 am 
<p>Hey John im experimenting once again. This time to examine how fast 
corraline algae responds to the NSW. For some reason its moderate growing with 
mixes. So we spent all day today changes things around. We also changes 
filtration system with higher out flows to seed the corraline algae better! 
Will take a few pic before and after and email to whoever wants to see results 
if its any different.</p> </li> 
<li> John on February 6th, 2012 11:21 am 
<p>Hello. In my reef system I use an artificial salt mix as it isn&rsquo;t 
practical to use NSW. The corraline grows steadily and makes some very 
interesting shapes. I need to clean it off the glass, particularly in the 
corners once every three months generally, so it&rsquo;s slow growing (which 
from a cleaning point of view is an advantage). The lighting is low power, a 
bank of five fluorescents, blue and marine white.<br>
 I suppose theoretically 
there should not be a great deal of difference between growth with NSW or 
artificial provided the mixtures are up to spec and kept so.<br>
 It will be 
interesting to see what happens.</p> </li> </ol>
