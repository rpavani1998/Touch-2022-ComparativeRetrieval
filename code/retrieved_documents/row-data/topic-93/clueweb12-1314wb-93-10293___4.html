<h1>Water, water</h1> Columns From the other side &mdash; 15 September 2011 
<br> <br>

<p><em><strong>By Rick van Rossum</strong></em></p> 
<p>Water, water, everywhere, not a drop to drink. Sounds familiar, 
doesn&rsquo;t it? At Hartbeespoort we know all about it. Water shortages have 
become commonplace in summer.</p> 
<p>Even right now there are townships in Madibeng where the residents have not 
had any water in their homes for more than two weeks. When we do get water from 
the taps we worry about drinking it because it looks and tastes like, well you 
know what. It&rsquo;s not always so but you never know, do you? Of course we 
know why, the population has doubled and the water works hasn&rsquo;t, so there 
just isn&rsquo;t enough to go round. When they try to push too much through, 
the process just doesn&rsquo;t cope and it is not treated properly.</p> 
<p>Reservoirs run dry and all the muck in the bottom gets into the pipes and 
out of the taps. Of course they should be cleaned out regularly but 
they&rsquo;re not. Why is there muck, it&rsquo;s because the water wasn&rsquo;t 
cleaned properly in the first place. Do you want to know a secret? Do you know 
where they get the water from to treat and push up to the reservoir? Well they 
suck it out of the dam, near the dam wall just below the surface off the 
shoreline, where the algae and other unspeakables float in the water and get 
sucked right up.</p> 
<p>Do you know how they clean that water? Well I&rsquo;ve often seen it done 
and it&rsquo;s not what I would expect. The water is run for a short distance 
to let some of the sediment settle out, then fine air bubbles are released 
under it, which gets hold of most of the algae and lets it float to the top 
where it is scooped off. Then it&rsquo;s passed through a sand filter, like 
your pool, and when it&rsquo;s available, some chlorine is put in to kill off 
bacteria before it is pushed up to the reservoirs. That&rsquo;s about it, 
don&rsquo;t think that there are any fancy chemicals or systems that will 
filter out pharmaceuticals, chemicals or minerals that could harm you. Your 
kidneys will do that for you. What you do with the stuff is up to your system. 
If you&rsquo;re lucky it&rsquo;ll get rid of it, if not, don&rsquo;t ask.</p> 
<p>Ever thought where the dam gets its water from in winter? It all comes down 
the Crocodile River, night and day, summer or winter. No rain in winter, you 
say, that&rsquo;s right, so where from? The sewage works of Joburg of course, 
silly. Now that I&rsquo;ve got your attention, where does the Sewage works get 
the water from, why from the kind people in Joburg, where it&rsquo;s been 
through their kidneys already. They&rsquo;re OK, they get it from the Lesotho 
Mountains, nice and clean, most of the time.</p> 
<p>So what to do? Take care of yourselves, if you can&rsquo;t be sure of the 
water from the tap, treat it before you drink it. In my opinion use one of 
these Reverse Osmoses, RO, gadgets with the built in filters that&rsquo;ll take 
out the obvious muck, taste and smell, then pushes it through a very fine 
membrane and you&rsquo;ll get the best water you can get.</p> 
<p>Oh I know the stories about, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good to remove all the 
minerals&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Well I would rather start with clear and clean water and add whatever 
minerals I choose to add to my diet, than rely on chance and drink whatever 
toxic poisons are collected on the way through all the industrial waste and not 
to forget all that AMD, acid mine drainage, everyone is talking about.</p> 
<p>They may get it right one day but until then? Better to be safe than sorry. 
And what do we know about all that expensive bottled water everyone is pushing? 
Is it really fit to drink? A fancy label doesn&rsquo;t make it so.</p>  Share
