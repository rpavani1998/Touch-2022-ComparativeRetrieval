 &laquo; MaLode Urges Eco-Approach to

The Garden: Weeding Out Greenwash &raquo; <br>

<h1>Bottled Water to Disappear at MaLode</h1> 
<p>Last season, when we made the decision to eliminate the use of bottled 
water at Mother Lode and use coolers and cups instead, we had our reasons. Now 
those reasons, and a lot more, were included in this article on bottled water 
Emily recently wrote for The High Country News. If you are interested in her

<p>Tell Me Sweet Little Lies&hellip;<br>
by Emily Underwood </p>  Bottled 
water has never made sense. The fact is it has always been an elaborate PR 
scam, both an invented necessity and a bizarre symbol of luxury. Nevertheless, 
I buy bottled water sometimes, especially on long car trips. When I do, I often 
buy &ldquo;Fiji&rdquo; water. I don&rsquo;t know why. I just like its square 
shape, snazzy palm frond label, and the frosty coolness as I pull it out of the 
service station refrigerator.  I have always known, vaguely, that I am being 
seduced by the phrase &ldquo;natural artesian water,&rdquo; and by the 
company&rsquo;s more shameless greenwashing: &ldquo;Every drop is green.&rdquo; 
I know better than to believe such nonsense, but I enjoy forgetting what I know 
as I listen to the gurgle of gasoline filling up my tank and eat a frozen 
Snickers bar. Most of us know that feeling.
<p></p> 
<p>Every bottled water company has a special spin: Evian has tried for years 
now to convince us that drinking its bottled water will make us thin and 
sophisticated, possibly even French. Dasani, by Coca Cola, goes for mystery 
with its shapely blue bottle and &ldquo;mouthwatering&rdquo; mineral formula. 
Nestle&rsquo;s brand name, Pure Life, shares its name with a prominent 
Christian group whose mission is to deliver believers from sexual sin.</p> 
<p>Something all the bottled water companies have in common these days, 
however, is aggressive greenwashing. It turns out Fiji runs one of the most 
surreal and manipulative of the campaigns.<br>
&ldquo;We are proud to offer a 
fine artesian water that is good for people and good for the 
environment,&rdquo; they say. Nonsense. A recent study by the Pacific 
Institute, Energy Implications of Bottled Water has forever ruined Fiji water 
for me.</p> 
<p>The study, published in the February 2009 peer-reviewed Environmental 
Research Letters, finds that bottled water takes *up to 2000 times more energy* 
to produce than drinking water from the tap. The two biggest energy sucks are 
production of the bottles (it takes the energetic equivalent of 50 million 
barrels of oil per year to produce the bottles) and transportation of the 
bottles to their final destination.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Artesian&rdquo; means that Fiji water is from an authentic 
spring&ndash; and the spring is indeed on the island of Fiji. The company has 
promised to reduce its emissions and packaging, use more renewable energy, and 
use carbon offsets, as well as protect their source&rsquo;s watershed, the Sovi 
Basin Rainforest. They have even set the goal of becoming carbon 
negative&hellip;someday.</p> 
<p>However, none of those intentions can diminish the fact that Fiji bottled 
water travels over 5000 miles by air or boat to get to San Francisco. Fiji 
can&rsquo;t realistically claim to be any more environmentally responsible than 
companies who transport water a shorter distance. And they don&rsquo;t come 
close to being as green as municipal water, which skips the carbon-heavy 
bottles altogether.</p> 
<p>To say Fiji water is &ldquo;good&rdquo; for the environment is quite a 
stretch. There is also the question of resource allocation&ndash;the island of 
Fiji is historically vulnerable to catastrophic drought. In past decades Fijian 
farmers have starved because there wasn&rsquo;t enough water for irrigation, 
which calls into question the wisdom of shipping Fijian water overseas to be 
sold as a luxury item. (For a thoughtful discussion of the impact of the 
bottled water industry on communities in the U.S., see Christina Ammons&rsquo; 
2007 HCN story, &ldquo;Watershed Moment&rdquo; about the controversy 
surrounding Nestle&rsquo;s bottling enterprise in McCloud, California.)</p> 
<p>Finally, there is little evidence to support the idea that bottled water is 
any better for you than tap water. Food and Water Watch in their aggressive 
anti-bottled water and anti-water privatization campaign, point out that 
quality testing standards are far less stringent for bottled water than for 
municipal supplies. For example, whereas municipal water must be tested for 
fecal coliform bacteria 100 times per month, a little over 3 times a day, 
bottled water plants only have to check once a week. A study by the Natural 
Resources Defense Council found more than the allowed amount of bacteria in 
more than one fifth of 103 tested brands. And bottled water, unlike constantly 
moving municipal water, is stagnant, and therefore more conducive to bacterial 
replication.</p>  I&rsquo;m not one to get paranoid about bacteria in bottled 
water, although the leaching phthalates, which are also unregulated, are a bit 
creepy. But considering the environmental costs of producing bottled water, the 
fact that there is no proven health benefit to drinking it makes it even 
crazier to choose bottled water over tap.
<p></p> 
<p>Americans spent $11 billion on bottled water in 2006, and drank over 33 
billion liters in 2007, which works out to about 30 gallons per person. The 
rising rate of consumption speaks to the success of bottled water company PR 
campaigns.</p> 
<p>More seriously, however, it reflects Americans&rsquo; fundamental distrust 
of public water systems. Concerns about deteriorating public water 
infrastructure, and trace contaminants that the EPA doesn&rsquo;t regulate are 
harder to dispel than misleading advertisements. $6 billion of the stimulus 
package was set aside for local clean and drinking water infrastructure 
improvements, which have been neglected for far too long. But it will take more 
than infrastructure improvements to regain America&rsquo;s trust in the tap.</p>
<p>For one thing, we need better risk assessment. Reverse osmosis, which 
forces water through a selectively-permeable membrane, is theoretically the 
best technology for purification, and companies like Aquafina and Dasani use it 
in their plants. However, it is also the most energy-intensive form of 
purification, and is no real guarantee of quality since the membranes 
themselves are susceptible to bacterial colonization.</p> 
<p>In the long run, we can&rsquo;t afford the bottled water solution socially, 
environmentally, or economically. We need better information about how much 
purification is actually necessary for health, and then we need to find ways to 
make that technology efficient and affordable to use in our public systems. 
Otherwise, we will be increasingly forced to drink water that isn&rsquo;t 
significantly safer, but still costs us more than gasoline. And those of us who 
can&rsquo;t afford bottled water will be stuck with a broken system&ndash; a 
situation reminiscent of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s disastrous pronouncement, 
&ldquo;Let them eat cake.&rdquo; Except this time it will be, &ldquo;Let them 
drink Perrier.&rdquo;</p>
