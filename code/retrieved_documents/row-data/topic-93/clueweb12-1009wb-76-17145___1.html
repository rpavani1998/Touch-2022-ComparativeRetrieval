 When the people of Fiji are no long suffering due to 
lack of clean water and reporters are able to get clear cut answers out of the 
Resnicks about why they are not helping the Fijian people only exploiting them 
is when I will purchase Fiji water. In other words I WILL NEVER support it or 
buy it! in fact I started a campaign against it on my college campus!  07.23.11 
@ 3:01 PM  carl mielcarek  I was given your Fijigreen water at the Beladio 
casino in las vegas. and i liked the taste of the water  03.24.11 @ 7:01 PM  
Simon  How has the tragedy that has befallen Japan affected FIji Water? I can 
imagine that anyone would be a little skeptical before purchasing your product. 
I for one would not purchase it anymore until properly satisfied.  03.23.11 @ 
11:14 PM  FIJI Water  Michael, thank you for the comment! We always want to 
know if our customers are not satisfied with our water. We are still sourcing 
from the same place (Fiji), if you are noticing a difference in taste it 
something we want to investigate. Can we put you in touch with our customer 
relations department? Thanks, FIJI Water  03.17.11 @ 9:40 AM  Michael Mohajer  
Has Fiji been sourcing its water elsewhere? I have been drinking nothing but 
Fiji bottled water for the last 4 years. I buy about 3 cases a month from 
Trader Joe's, which sells them for about 1 dollar per bottle less than anywhere 
else. This month, the water hasnt been as crisp and frefreshing as it has 
always been to me. It tastes a little stale and heavy like tap water. Maybe its 
just me..  03.17.11 @ 6:03 AM  FIJI Water  Thank you for your interest in FIJI 
Water. At this time, we are fortunate enough to already have a strong partners 
in your region. However, we appreciate your inquiry and would appreciate if you 
could please send an email with your contact information to info@fijiwater.com 
so that we can keep your details on file for future reference.  02.09.11 @

want to import F I J I bottled water for the South African Market . Please send 
us details, minimum quantity and all other information kind regards Vafiahmed

Blue-Eyed Girl  Frankly, Dorian Roffe-Hammond, I find the idea of being 
poisoned by the water provided by my municipality downright ludicrous as well. 
I refuse to be pumped full of chlorine, fluoride, estrogen, and other 
contaminants while they continue to assure me it is &quot;safe&quot;. It is a 
shame that I have to purchase clean, healthy water from a country thousands of 
miles away from my home, but until that is no longer necessary I will gladly do 
it to ensure my health and the health of my loved ones.  12.07.10 @ 7:50 PM

your comment. Hopefully this answers your questions. We believe that Fiji is 
home to the best water on the planet, and the people of Fiji should be able to 
enjoy it as much as the rest of the world does. Reliable access to clean, safe 
drinking water is common throughout much of Fiji, but there are still numerous 
villages and communities where infrastructure is lacking. As a result, diseases 
spread due to unclean water and lack of sanitation, such as typhoid, are not an 
uncommon problem there. In 2007, we set up the FIJI Water Foundation with one 
of its key goals to increase access to clean water in Fiji. Since then, the 
foundation has funded projects to bring clean water to over 40,000 Fijians, and 
counting. Check out the FIJI Water Foundation at www.fijiwaterfoundation.org. 
No, it is not true that our FIJI Water bottles come from China. We actually 
blow-mold our bottles on site at the FIJI plant from high-grade PET resin. Our 
use of the highest grade resin yields bottles of the greatest clarity and 
strength that protect the water&rsquo;s pristine quality and taste. This resin 
can only be sourced from a few locations in the world. In our case, we source 
this PET resin from Thailand and Taiwan. Keep in mind that our PET bottles are 
fully recyclable and that PET bottles require 24% less energy to produce, 
generate 40% less solid waste, and emit 46% less carbon during shipping than 
glass bottles. Because there are no municipal sources of power at the FIJI 
Water bottling plant, we rely on a diesel generator for electricity as the only 
viable source of reliable power. However, we are continually evaluating 
alternative sources of energy to supplement our current source. In the meantime 
we are reducing our energy use through a series of operational efficiency and 
equipment upgrade projects at the plant. FIJI Water is committed to running our 
business, in Fiji and around the world, as energy-efficiently as possible. See 
our website, 
http://www.fijiwater.com/giving-back/environment/sustainable-practices/ for 
more info. Thanks for your comment.  12.01.10 @ 4:23 PM  Dorian Roffe-Hammond  
Frankly, the idea of transporting enormous quantities of water by container 
ship thousands of miles across an ocean so it can be consumed elsewhere from 
its origin is downright ludicrous. I do not drink bottled water. And I strongly 
disagree with the trend.  12.01.10 @ 3:59 PM  Jerry K.  May I offer my services 
to visit the bottling plant and investigate some of these issues? Then I will 
provide a concise report for everyone to read. I recommend at least a month's 
time at my standard hourly rates with expenses.  12.01.10 @ 2:38 PM  Joe Keating
 I am certain that once the fiji government realized the crushing blow they 
would receive by their taxing effort, quick negotiations / other accomodations 
were quickly put into place to either lessen the tax blow or remove it 
altogether. Let's be real here folks!  12.01.10 @ 1:15 PM  Bob Jordan  I say, 
tell the Fiji gov. to &quot;stick it&quot; with their taxes. Just like any 
sucessful business, they wait in line to STEAL anything they can. They're no 
different than any gov. entity anywhere, STEAL all they can and do nothing but 
sit and wait for the next victim(business) to make a $ with hard work, 
innovation and smarts!  12.01.10 @ 12:32 PM  Jacqueline  Can you please tell us 
more about these accusations, is this true? &quot;island risk exposure to 
typhoid because of their own unsanitary water supplies. Or that Fiji water 
bottles are made from Chinese plastic in a diesel-fueled manufacturing 
plant&quot;  12.01.10 @ 1:30 AM  Robert  I think it is awful that the fijian 
government wants to raise taxes on your company by 5000%. I love your water, 
but if I was in your shoes I would be looking for a new place to set up shop. I 
hope you were able to work out some better deal than 15 cents a liter.  
11.30.10 @ 2:45 PM  Scott  I am glad to read that the people of Fiji will 
continue to benefit from the jobs created by Fiji Water. Though the tax 
increase seems excessive, I believe that it is in the best interest of both the 
Fijian people and Fiji Water that the relationship continue.  11.30.10 @ 1:08 PM
