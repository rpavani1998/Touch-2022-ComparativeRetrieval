<h3>Wanted: Your real-life experiences with rain barrels</h3> 
<p><em>by Susan<br>
Here in DC we're compiling information about good 
landscaping practices for our website, and have canvassed the local 
eco-listservs to that end.&nbsp; Here's what we have so far on the subject of 
rain barrels, and I welcome your feedback, corrections and additions.&nbsp; 
Details about suppliers, Making them yourself and maintenance are needed but my 
BIG question is this:&nbsp; Can one or even two 55-gallon barrels really make a 
difference, or are they mainly feel-good items, as one expert suggested to me?
</em></p> 
<p>Why all the interest in rain barrels?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>They reduce or eliminate runoff of stormwater into our watershed, which 
means less downstream pollution and sedimentation.&nbsp; Even here in the East 
where we've been having prolonged droughts, global weirding has also brought 
more severe downpours, so the runoff problem is just getting worse.</li> 
<li>They reduce the load on our municipal water supplies.</li> 
<li>They save (a little) on our water bills, though not enough to justify 
using them on the basis of cost alone.&nbsp; In one test a rain barrel saved 
about 1,300 gallons over the summer, and one user told me he'd saved $35 over 
the course of the summer.</li> 
<li>They collect naturally soft, chlorine-free rainwater for use on our 
plants, which may result in increased plant health (though our petroleum-based 
roofing products and bird poop contribute their own pollution to the mix, sorry 
to say).</li> 
<li>Reflecting these advantages, starting in 2008 Montgomery County, MD will 
be offering rebates to residents who use rain barrels.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>WHICH TO BUY?</strong><br>
Here's what I've learned from some Web 
research and advice offered by local gardeners on local Yahoo groups:</p> 
<p>Some users say &quot;The bigger the better&quot; while others suggest 
working backwards to determine how much excess water your garden could actually 
use.&nbsp; Whatever size or combination you use, have an overflow system 
because rain barrels can fill up in as few as 5 minutes. Surprised?&nbsp; Well, 
a quarter-inch of rain falling on an average-size house yields slightly over 
200 gallons!&nbsp; If you're<em>really </em>serious about rain harvesting and 
have a larger garden, 450-gallon barrels are available.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<blockquote> &nbsp; </blockquote> </ul> 
<p>One DC resident wrote to say she first bought four 75-gallon barrels from 
<strong>Gardener's Supply</strong><strong>,</strong> one for each corner 
downspout.&nbsp; After several years one of them froze and cracked, after which 
she found even better barrels. &quot;They're produced by the<strong>RiverSides 
Program</strong> in Toronto, hold 132 gallons in the same footprint as the 
Gardeners Supply 75-gallon, AND they're designed to withstand freezing.&quot; 
She continues: &quot;If anyone is interested in purchasing one, please let me 
know.&nbsp; We purchased ours through a group buy and saved a lot - $190 
instead of $250 plus.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d like to get another and and know others 
who want one as well.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Someone else wrote to recommend the full-service company<strong> Aquabarrel 
</strong>and their website looked so promising, I immediately asked for and got 
an interview with owner Barry Chenkin.&nbsp; He told me they make their barrels 
locally in Gaithersburg, MD using recycled materials and sell either mail order 
or at two retail sites so far - Amicus Green in Kensington, the Washington 
Cathedral, and soon, Gingko's in DC. They sell kits, individual parts, or full 
service including installation.&nbsp; Owner Barry Chenkin is so excited about 
this stuff he calls himself a Master Rain Harvester, and indeed he is, offering 
build-it-yourself workshops and/or PowerPoints on the subject of rain barrels 
through the Anacostia Watershed Society and Community Forklift.&nbsp; We'll try 
to get the details and help publicize the events. Here's hisvideo introduction.
<br> </p> 
<p><strong> More Sources and Prices</strong><br>
The University of Rhode 
Island site offers this guidance about prices: &quot;Ready-made rain barrels 
range from $89 to $135 each depending on size, style and added features.&quot; 
Well, that's not much help, is it?&nbsp; Unfortunately, the largest size 
refurbished barrel is 55 gallons; barrels from unrecycled materials are 
available in larger sizes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Spruce Creek Rain Saver.com (recommended on the site of Maryland's Dept. 
of Natural Resources) sells a 54-gallon barrel for $155.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li>Gardener's Supply's 75-gallon Deluxe costs $135.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>RiverSides in Canada sells 132-gallon barrels for $190 as a group or $250 
individually.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Another reader recommended the local source Arlington Echo, and here's 
theirorder form. [pdf]&nbsp; Barrels cost $50 each plus $14 for attachment 
&quot;stuff,&quot; but the order form doesn't say how many gallons they hold, 
though 55 gallons would be a good bet.&nbsp; They're located in Millersville, 
MD, so it's possible to pick up the barrels yourself and save on the hefty 
shipping charges (no matter where you buy them).</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>AquaBarrel sells refurbished 55-gallon barrels for $100 at retail outlets, 
which is preferable because shipping even locally starts at about $55 for one 
barrel.&nbsp; They'll do the installation for you for a $45 preinstallation 
inspection and $65/hour to install (a simple one-barrel system typically takes 
2 hours).</li> </ul>

<li>Maryland's Department of Natural Resources How to uild your own.</li> 
<li>Takoma Park gives workshops in building your own, which cost only $35 
&quot;and some DIY&quot;.&nbsp; I'll try to find out more and include the 
details here.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>OPERATING AND MAINTAINING ONE</strong><br>
Barry at Aquabarrel 
explained to me that by virtue of their shape (something technie about how 
freezing works), refurbished barrels<em>must </em>to be emptied for the 
winter.&nbsp; His system uses a diverter (photo) to restore the usual rain path 
down the downspout.&nbsp; HisOwner's Manual has more. </p> 
<p>And from the University of Rhode Island comes this advice:&nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fine mesh screen should be used to cover any openings in the rain barrel 
to prevent mosquitoes and to trap debris.</li> 
<li>Rain barrels can be installed upon blocks or wooden crate to provide 
height for gravity flow purposes.</li> 
<li>Rain barrels should be drained and removed for the winter months to 
prevent ice damage - the details about how to do that arehere on this page. 
</li> </ul> 
<p>Ah, this just in from the owner of rain barrels in my town of Takoma Park:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As to whether<strong> fine mesh screen</strong> needs to be used, the 
Gardener's Supply barrel has a &quot;lid&quot; that's made of screening 
material to keep out debris and bugs. The homemade one is closed except for the 
hole that the downspout empties into. In order to keep debris out, we used a 
piece of window screening over that hole. If your barrel is screened off like 
this, then you shouldn't need mosquito dunks because they shouldn't be getting 
into the water.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> As to <strong>installing</strong> them on blocks or wooden crate 
to provide height for gravity flow purposes, I use my barrels to fill watering 
cans so it's not such an issue for me, but if you want to use it with a hose or 
soaker hose, having it higher will create more &quot;flow&quot;. Also, the 
spigot needs to be really close to the bottom of the barrel so you can get all 
the water. Having it up on something makes it easier to get to. Both of mine 
have hose sections attached though for more manouverability. <br>
</blockquote> 
As for that Rhode Island's<strong>winterizing</strong> advice in the link 
above, (which I found confusing) she writes: <br>

<blockquote> This is all about how you have to have a shorter downspout when 
the barrel is under it. So you cut off a section in the appropriate height and 
then put it away to use again when the rain barrel is gone for the winter. 
You'll need some sort of a joining piece between the section you cut off and 
the part still on the house though. For one I replaced the entire section with 
those &quot;flexible downspout extensions&quot; they sell everywhere. For the 
other I used a small flexible piece to reconnect the cut off piece. Again, if 
you see it it makes perfect sense. Just hard to explain in words. The last 
sentence refers to something you'd put on the end of the cut off downspout to 
direct the water into the rain barrel. The hinged thing they refer to is 
something you can get from catalogs. The S-shaped thing seems like too much 
work. I used the small flexible piece (available at Home Depot) which I also 
use to reconnect the downspout cutoff. <br>

<p>Coming soon: the Rain Garden alternative.&nbsp; One reader wrote to tell me 
she directed her downspouts to carry rainwater to her garden, which brings us 
to rain garden techniques as another way to accomplish the same ends.&nbsp; So 
that'll be the next subject we tackle.</p>

<p>One question - how do you save 1300 gallons of water over the summer if it 
doesn't rain?</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: emmakw | December 21, 2007 at 11:17 AM </p> 
<p>My dad (who has a greenhouse retail business in the UK) used to have a nice 
little sideline selling used foot container barrels - the stuff big quantities 
of orange juice, brined vegetables etc are shipped in - as rain barrels 
(dedicated rain barrels being basically the same thing massively overpriced at 
the time). These can often be obtained cheap if you have a food factory of some 
kind nearby and come in all sizes up to massive.</p> 
<p>The diverters are excellent (although I'm not familar with the model 
featured) and well worth the extra few bucks.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: tai haku | December 22, 2007 at 05:41 AM </p> 
<p>I would like to have one but to do what I'd like them to do I would need 
some sort of filter to clean the water from my asphalt shingle roof. I don't 
think these barrels can be used to help with vegetables and edible plants 
unless the water from asphalt roofs is cleaned. Too many chemicals could go 
into the barrel from the shingles. Still if you're lucky enough to have a slate 
or other type of roof I think they would be really helpful. I may invest in a 
stand alone version at some point.</p> <br>

<p>In Colorado, rainwater collection is &quot;is subject to the Constitution 
of the State of Colorado, state statutes, and case law&quot; but we have a rain 
barrel anyway in the back yard. We use it to divert the snow melt away from the 
house since the foundation doesn't need so much water.</p> 
<p>There is a company in Texas that collects and sells rainwater for drinking: 
rainwater.org.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Valerie | December 22, 2007 at 07:19 AM </p> 
<p>Great post! I think rainwater collection is going to become increasingly 
important in the next few years. Weather patterns are becoming completely 
erratic in some places, and sometimes it seems hard to justify watering flowers 
and veg when there's a drought going on.</p> 
<p>My husband and I built a rain barrel system that holds about 500 gallons. 
We've posted about it a few times (at the &quot;rain harvester&quot; tag on our 
blog). We plan to write up the detailed how-to this winter. It was simple, and 
cheap! The whole thing cost under $200, and it provided water all summer. We 
never once had to turn to the well.</p> 
<p>We are looking to expand the garden sometime in the future--which will mean 
expanding our water capacity--so we're very interested in reading up on various 
collection methods. I can't wait until I have time to read this more closely 
and follow through on all those links. Thanks!</p> <br>

<p>Oh, and to answer the question you posed: Can one or even two 55-gallon 
barrels really make a difference, or are they mainly feel-good items, as one 
expert suggested to me?</p> 
<p>YES! Before we build our rain harvester we were using a 55-gallon trash can 
wedged under a downspout. It was a mosquito nightmare, but our moderately dry 
southeastern PA summer kept it full enough that we could dunk a watering can a 
few times a week to give our garden a boost. Ten good minutes of rain would 
refill the barrel.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Meg | December 22, 2007 at 07:57 AM </p> 
<p>Rain barrels are just a start. I wish I had a cistern like the house I grew 
up in had.</p> 
<p>Husband made me one from found items. (he is so handy) I like it , water 
all potted plants with it, I want one for our detached garage so I don't have 
to haul water to the back of the lot.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: tibs | December 22, 2007 at 08:25 AM </p> 
<p>We have two rain barrels (like the $135 ones from Gardeners Supply) one 
which we received from the City of Austin at a discount price of $35 as part of 
its water conservation program and one which was a gift. We intend, someday, to 
put in a complete rainwater collection system. Toward that end, when a tree 
fell on our house and we had to have the roof replaced, we chose a metal roof.
</p> 
<p>I use the rainwater mostly for potted plants or to water 
recently-transplanted seedlings. I do not think the rain barrels save me very 
much on my water usage but as far as I'm concerned every little bit helps. If 
everyone took small steps, it would have a bigger impact than just a few people 
taking large steps.</p> 
<p>One problem in Austin is that we can go weeks without rain and then get a 
downpour of 4 inches in an afternoon. Two rain barrels alone don't provide 
enough water to see us through the dry spells and they quickly overflow during 
floods.</p> 
<p>Our solution, as I said, is to eventually get a much larger system.</p> <br>
<p> Posted by: mss @ Zanthan Gardens | December 22, 2007 at 08:47 AM </p> 
<p>In my prairie garden, average 14&quot; precipitation a year, we had a big 
metal rainwater barrel, which stood on our back steps. The steps had a little 
landing at the top and as it was about 4' above the garden we ran a gravity-fed 
drip hose from a tap my clever partner soldered into the barrel near the bottom 
and that serviced all four 10x4' vegetable beds. Veggies were planted more 
closely than recommended so that leaves completely shaded the earth once the 
plants were part grown, as the beds had at least 14 hours of sun a day. 
Rainfall tended to be short heavy thunder storms during the summer but the 
barrel provided enough basic water supply. If we had had a long run of very hot 
weather and tomatos for instance were developing fruit, I occasionally did a 
little supplementary watering.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: sandra | December 22, 2007 at 09:21 AM </p> 
<p>We recently installed two 60-g olive barrels re-purposed as rain barrels 
(and I blogged about it). Both filled to overflow when we got less than one 
inch of rain last week.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, both barrels have slow leaks from the hose adapter things, 
and need to be re-caulked.</p> 
<p>They were badly caulked by the seller, and I failed to improve matters by 
choosing the wrong caulking material when I gave it a go.</p> 
<p>My garden is small, and only half of it needs supplemental water during the 
dry season--by which I mean there is no reasonable expectation of rain from May 
through Sept, and only light rains in April and October.</p> 
<p>Having now emptied one 60-g barrel (in order to dry it for re-caulking) and 
using the water in the garden as I would normally do, I think if I had one more 
60-g barrel, I plant to go without using any city water during a normal dry 
season.</p> 
<p>I can't fathom any reason why this should be seen merely as feel-goodery.
</p> 
<p>My advice about rain barrels is to buy them locally, with some sort of 
warranty about quality, or at least good word-of-mouth. Also look for models 
that have very few places to leak from! Freezing isn't an issue for me, if 
that's relevant.</p> <br>

<p>We have used rainbarrels for the last seven years and absolutely love 
them.We made the first one out of a garbage can.We cut a hole at the top into 
the side and added a spigot for easy emptying on the bottom.The other one we 
bought ready to use from a local Farmsupply store.During long dry spells i use 
them to top off the small pond we have,we also water potted plants with them.To 
make them more appealing in the landscape we planted bushes around them,no one 
knows they are there unless you are standing right next to them.Both hold about 
100 gallons and I would highly recommend them.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: luise h | December 22, 2007 at 02:21 PM </p> 
<p>Great post. We have 2 of the Aquabarrel rain barrels that are linked 
together. They are great, I love'm. No leaks and best of all the overflow is 
super huge and we have never had water overflow out the top - it takes a 
4&quot; landscape pipe - we buried the landscape pipe and also used their 
drainbox at the end of the pipe at the rain garden (limits erosion) - No 
mosquito issue to speak of either.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Sue | December 22, 2007 at 06:19 PM </p> 
<p>I love my rainbarrel and want 3 more - a cistern too would be great. <br>
 
Be careful with using collected rainbarrel water on your edibles and herbs IF 
your rainwater is washing down from your roof - esp. if you have asbestos 
shingles or live in a very urban (bad air pollution) area.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Kathy J, Washington Gardener | December 22, 2007 at 07:30 PM 
</p> 
<p>As a chemist, I've thought a little about pollution in my rain barrel 
water. My conjectures follow...</p> 
<p>Say it rains for three days. Any pollution settled on a roof that CAN be 
washed off by water likely WILL be washed off in the first two days. By the 
third day, the water coming off the roof will be reasonably clean. Not 
necessarily for drinking, but okay for vegetable gardening. (although, I have 
tasted it and it tastes like plain old water.)</p> 
<p>All it takes is 1&quot; of rainfall to fill my barrels. So if I just wait 
to collect the water from the tail-end of a heavy late spring storm, I'm set.
</p> 
<p>Asphalt is petroleum-based. Petroleum repels water, and water-soluble 
petroleum-based leachates are likely to be susceptible to quick decomposition 
by soil microbes. I'm certain my garden soil is rich with microbes.</p> 
<p>Heavy metals from car pollution settled on the roof are a slight concern. 
If I was really concerned, I could buy a filter.</p> 
<p>And I think about today's global food supply chains (
http://www.gardenrant.com/my_weblog/2007/11/no-free-lunch.html)<br>
 and I feel 
pretty comfortable taking my chances with vegetables from my own garden watered 
with rain water collected off my roof.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: chuck b. | December 22, 2007 at 08:08 PM </p> 
<p>I like the concept. I got one at a neighborhood workshop sponsored by some 
environmental group, and I'm not really happy with it. It has all the problems 
identified in the Aquabarrel video.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: peter Hoh | December 22, 2007 at 09:28 PM </p> 
<p>We have two rain barrels, which I use to top off my container pond (the 
fish don't have any problem with runoff from my asphalt shingle roof) and to 
fill up a can for whatever hand watering I do. The overflow from one rain 
barrel is directed into a dry stream that flows into a rain garden (
http://www.penick.net/digging/?p=222). I love my rain barrels--only $65 each 
from the City of Austin and no problems with leaks or cracking.</p> 
<p>However, as MSS points out, two rain barrels can't hold enough water to get 
us through the dry summer months. I'd really love to have a cistern one day.</p>
<br>

<p>When we bought our home 15 years ago from a then 80 year old gardener &amp; 
florist, he had just a huge blue barrel under one of the down-spouts, so I left 
it and used it for all my potted containers-outdoors in the summer and indoors 
during the non-freezing times the rest of the year.<br>
 To me, the 
&quot;new&quot; phase of rain barrels is something that I inherited and cost me 
nothing, but provided many, many benefits over the years by not having to use 
our over-chlorinated tap water for my plants.<br>
 Leave it to an 80 year old 
gardener to guide this newby gardener with something so basic. Plus the 
exercise I gain filling and lugging my watering cans is another perk.<br>
 I 
just don't see myself shelling out the big bucks for all the new barrels and 
items that are now available. Seems like gardener-gouging to me.<br>
 I am 
certainly glad to see that we are finally learning the value of water and 
reinventing more ways to recyle it.</p> <br>

<p>This is a GREAT post and very timely for me. My husband and I have been 
puzzling over how to construct our own rail barrel(s) after the great drought 
of '07 here in the D.C. area. I live on a 0.9 acre lot with 25 mature trees so 
water for my garden is at a premium! Thanks so much for this post and all the 
helpful comments.</p> <br>

<p>This is a great post. I have long thought that water supply and water usage 
will be esssential issues in the 21st century. We were living in Beijing in 
1989. Beijing is a desert - and yet we saw the hotel's cars being washed with 
lots of water, keeping them up to a 'western standard of cleanliness'. It 
seemed a waste then, and even more so now that private ownership of cars is so 
much more common.</p> <br>

<p>Rain barrels are a moot point in my Mediterranean climate - no real 
measurable rain fall from late April through late November.<br>
 When it does 
rain here starting ( fingers crossed ) in December thru March, most of my 
garden is semi dormant and does not require the rain .<br>
 The captured rain 
that would fill 2 or three barrels would be used up in a matter of weeks 
leaving the barrels barren for 6 months of the year.<br>
 At the moment even 
our indigenous reservoirs are at less than 40 percent capacity.<br>
 The only 
way a rain barrel system would benefit my small suburban garden is if it was 
paired up with a grey water system and I modified my sub- tropical plant 
collection habit to include only drought tolerant plants.<br>
 At the moment 
the garden is about 60 - 65 percent drought tolerant .<br>
 Darn those Cannas, 
Heliconias and Bananas !</p>

<p>We've been using rain barrels for several years. It took me and my Labor 
Pool (aka husband) many hours of research and store visits to figure out the 
best design for our purposes and climate (which we think is superior to many 
commercial ones). To provide the information to others I created a website on 
how to build your own rainbarrel for about $40. We've got pictures and 
step-by-step directions, FAQs, safety information, and even a rainfall 
collection calculator!</p>

<p>I have 5 55 gallon oak rain barrels on our property. For all but the summer 
drought it supplies all my irrigation needs when combined with xeriscaping and 
deep mulch techniques. We get about 30 rain events, so our 5 barrels are saving 
about 10,000 gallons per year. That is not huge, but not insignificant. Again, 
multiply that out to every home in a subdivision, and you begin talking about 
acre feet of runoff saved.</p> 
<p>Now, I make rain barrels for profit, so I am biased. But my goal is that 
Rain Barrels are &quot;toe in the door&quot; items to begin to alter thinking. 
For families using rain barrels, water is suddenly a Resource to be harvested, 
not a utility to be paid.</p> 
<p>We need to change our thinking to become more sustainable as a society, and 
Rain Barrels are a very good way to achieve that end. In my expierence I have 
seen numerous clients switch to more impactful water management practices like 
rain gardens and swales once they have a few barrels.<br>

<p>I have one rain barrel (not sure how many gallons--the plastic 
pickle-barrel kind) so far. It's great. Fills easily after not much rain, and 
really helps get through dry spells. I've no idea if the lack of chlorination 
makes a big difference in plant growth, but it's pretty darn nice water. I'd 
like to add a couple more barrels.</p> 
<p>Not sure if this was mentioned in the original post, but you can easily 
&quot;chain&quot; barrels by setting two side by side and placing a hose 
between them.</p> <br>

<p>I recommend the Rain Barrel Initiative sponsored by the Nine Mile Run 
Watershed Association (
http://www.ninemilerun.org/programs/rainbarrel/index.htm).<br>

<p>I only have a single 55-gallon barrel. It probably doesn't have much of an 
environmental impact, but I love it. The lower pressure is just right for 
hooking up a hose, dragging it to the base of a shrub and leaving it for a 
while as I putter around other parts of the yard. By the time all my shrubs are 
watered, I've usually accomplished quite a lot of weeding. I also appreciate 
being able to water my acid-loving plants (I know I should be growing plants 
more suitable to the soil I have, but I just can't bring myself to give up the 
luxury of my own blueberry patch!) with low pH rainwater. I plan to add 
another, larger, rain barrel this year.</p> <br>
