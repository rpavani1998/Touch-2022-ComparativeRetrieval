<p> We will explore science from God's point of view. Beginning with nothing, 
each day of creation God created the next building block needed to make the 
rest of the universe.<br>
 On the first three days He created the containers 
needed to hold the systems. On the next three days He filled these places with 
life. On the final day, He started the social environment of love and community 
with a party.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Electromagnetism, Physics and Chemistry</b>. God made light, atoms and 
molecules in our corner of the universe.</li> 
<li><b>Space, Earth and Water</b>. God created the three basic environments. 
</li> 
<li><b>Geology and Botany</b>. God separated the different environments and 
made the food supply.</li> 
<li><b>Astronomy</b>. God filled the sky. </li> 
<li><b>Zoology (Fish and Birds)</b>. God filled the oceans and skies with life.
</li> 
<li><b>Biology (land Animals and Humans)</b>. God filled the land with life. 
</li> 
<li><b>Spiritual, Social and Psychological Foundations</b>. God had a party to 
celebrate.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Science and Technology</b><br>
 Science has a way of finding what might 
be truth in the physical universe. This is called the scientific method. With 
every discovery made by one scientist, other scientists must be able to do the 
following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Duplicate the experiment </li> 
<li> Make a guess about what should happen if they change the experiment. </li>
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Evolution</b><br>
 The fact is, evolution is based upon an 
interpretation of some observations. However, the quality of specimens observed 
are few and in poor condition and the evidence on which they base their 
conclusions are subject to many other interpretations.<br>
 For example, the 
difference in skeleton size of related animals is taken as proof of evolution. 
However, the same evidence could be used to show that they are just relatives 
(like different types of cats) or that they are built according to the same 
design.<br>
 Evolution requires millions of years for the theories to work. <br>
 Because they can make correct guesses about the unknown, such as the existence 
of objects in space, it is not proof that the theory of evolution works - it is 
proof that the physical laws of the universe are stable. Creationism does not 
discount physical laws, in fact YHWH is a God of law and order. Creation only 
disputes some of the meanings, theories and conclusions scientists place on 
what they observe especially when they try to extrapolate back to the past to 
say when and how the object was formed and how it behaved.<br>
 For example, if 
you go to a new planet one can expect to find a force called gravity because 
the planet has mass. Confirming the existence of gravity does not prove how or 
when the planet was formed, it proves that the theory of gravity is reliable.
</p> 
<p> <b>Creation</b><br>
 How God created the world. Creationists and 
evolutionists believe different things about how the universe started. 
Evolutionists rely on the scientific method. Creationists claim that the 
scientific method is not good enough. It cannot measure the past accurately and 
it cannot measure some things that we cannot see. And God is so great, we 
cannot even think of a way to measure Him.<br>
 As we look at the wonderful 
things God created, I will try to point out facts that point to a creator.</p> 
<p> Proof<br>
</p> <br>
 This symbol will appear whenever we want to suggest 
an argument in favor of creation. <br>
<br>
 With each system or creature that 
God created, we will offer some basic arguments for you to think about as 
&quot;proof&quot; that they did not evolve over billions of years. Our proofs 
are based on the following:
<ul> 
<li><b>Designer</b>. The complexity and other coincidences related to the item 
indicated that a designer must have planned it.</li> 
<li><b>Time</b>. Many critical processes and all biological systems require a 
very short development time for success, but evolution requires a long time.
</li> 
<li><b>Impossibility</b>. There is no chance that the event would occur. </li> 
<li><b>Scientific Observations</b>. The process was observed in nature or in 
the laboratory and it totally contradicts the theory of evolution.</li> 
<li><b>Scientific Experiments</b>. A theory or discovery was tested in the 
laboratory and it contradicts the theory of evolution.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> The Plan of Salvation<br>
 Before the world was created, God also designed 
a Plan of Salvation to recreate us and bring peace between earth and heaven 
when man sinned. This plan was encoded in the design of the creation and 
follows rules and laws just like any fundamental principles of science.</p> 
<p> <b>Light: The Foundations Of The Universe</b><br>
</p> <b>Creation <br>

Day 1<br>
(Sunday) </b>  In the beginning there was nothing in our region of 
the universe but darkness. Then God<b>spoke</b> and the power of His voice 
produced electromagnetic waves that were the basis of all created things. When 
He spoke there was light. <br>
<b>Light</b> Where did the light come from if 
the sun was not created yet?<br>
In the process called nucleosynthesis, 
hydrogen can be burned to produce all the elements up to nickel. In this 
process light is produced. So on the first day Hydrogen, Helium and light were 
produced. Nucleosynthesis takes only 3 minutes, so there was more than enough 
time. <br>
 Our theory is that each day of creation corresponds to each period 
of the Periodic Table. <br>

<p> Electromagnetic waves are the basis of all matter. Depending on the wave 
length, it can either be seen, felt, heard or is totally invisible to the human 
senses. Long waves (like radio waves) have low energy and are very harmless. 
God created ears so that we could recognize them. Human beings have also 
created other equipment that can decode these waves.<br>
 The shortest, higher 
energy waves are gamma rays. They are harmful and the ozone layer helps to keep 
them from striking the earth.<br>
<br>
 Humans have used the electromagnetic 
spectrum to invent all sorts of wireless communications applications. We send 
and receive information with signals using frequencies that cannot be 
interpreted by the eyes and ears. But the receivers can interpret these signals 
and convert them to frequencies that the human eye and ear can interpret.</p>

Sabbath Vacation <br>
 Man has learned to harness the power of creation in 
reverse order. <br>
<br>

<p> <b>Consumer Appliances</b>. Engineers have divided up the frequencies of 
the radio wave and microwave spectrum into different channels for sending and 
receiving signals in consumer applications. They operate like one way private 
roads. A broadcaster can send signals to a receiver along this private 
electromagnetic highway on one channel (lane) and receive signals along another 
channel. The receiver translates the signals to pictures, sound, text or 
instructions. e.g. radio, television, phone, garage door opener.</p> 
<p> <b>Law and Order</b>. We explored the application of the radio spectrum to 
demonstrate the creative power of law and order and organization. Marconi 
harnessed the potential of these waves when he realized that he could use them 
to transmit language. But if standards were not set about the use of these 
frequencies there would be interference and chaos and we could not have 
proceeded as far as we have done in making consumer applications that improve 
our daily lives. It took a leap in thinking to realize that one can harness the 
power of electromagnetic waves and it took rules to make them work better by 
setting boundaries. And it took a naming and identification system to further 
increase the capabilities. e.g. Boundaries allow us to broadcast on 
walkie-talkies without interference, but personal identification allows us to 
make private phone calls.<br>
 In the same way God set strict standards of 
behavior between human beings, without these there would be chaos and mistrust. 
The laws of God do not take away our freedoms. The laws of God create an 
environment where we can make great leaps forward to increase freedoms which 
make our lives much more happy and convenient. With these we can advance to a 
greater potential that is beyond our imagination. So if we embrace the basics 
of honesty, generosity, respect, contentment and faithfulness we can discover 
powers from God that we never thought were possible. God also gave names to 
each of His creation, setting up the possibility of personal communication.<br>

So love can change things. Hope can see a future. Faith can also move mountains 
by talking to the personal God named YHWH.</p> 
<p> <b>Mishkan Bible Science: Quantum Physics And The Composition Of Matter</b>
.<br>
 The Bible models the relationships between the particles of matter 
better than all the current scientific theories. For years scientists believed 
that the electrons, protons and neutrons in the atom were the smallest objects 
in the universe. Now the Standard Model of Physics says that everything (all 
matter and radiation) in the universe is made up of 12 basic particles and 4 
basic forces. However, they have not discovered the source of gravity or mass 
as of 2011.</p>

<b>Creation</b>. Did you know that over 3500 years ago Moses 
described a mathematical model of the objects and their relationships inthe 
periodic table and the elements of particle physics in the Torah? <br>
<br>
<br>
 Neither the Standard Model nor the String Theory Models demonstrate the number 
of particles, relationship between the particles and the appearance of the 
particles like the Mishkan Model does. The Mishkan is the portable sanctuary 
that Moses built in the desert using a pattern given to him by God on Mount 
Sinai (Exodus 26). It is a model of the fundamental particles of hydrogen.
<p></p> 
<p> <b>&raquo; Fermions</b>. There are two fundamental particles. The Most 
Holy Place is the nucleus and the Holy Place is the orbiting electrons.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Quarks (Nucleus)</b>. Quarks are subatomic particles bound together by 
the strong atomic force. They make protons and neutrons which combine with 
electrons to form atoms which are the most common building blocks of life. 
Atoms combine to create molecules, proteins, DNA, cells and biological systems.
<br><b>&raquo; Proton (3 Quarks and 3 Antiquarks)</b>. 3 boards on the north 
wall and 3 boards on the south wall of the Most Holy Place.<br>
<b>&raquo; 
Neutron (3 Quarks and 3 Antiquarks)</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Leptons (Orbits)</b>. Leptons respond to the weak force, not the strong 
force and they make electrons and positrons.<br>
<b>&raquo; Electron (?)</b>. 
The Mishkan predicts 14 particles and 14 antiparticles.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>&raquo; Bosons</b>. There are four fundamental forces which hold the 
fundamental particles together. In the Mishkan, the forces look like the 
objects in the structure.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Strong Force (Gluon)</b>. A particle that transmits the strong nuclear 
force which glues quarks together into protons and neutrons. It is only found 
in the nucleus.<br>
<b>&raquo; 6 Charged + 2 Neutral Particles</b>. 6 boards of 
the west wall and 2 corner boards.</li> 
<li><b>Photon (Electromagnetic Force)</b>. Hold particles together in the atom.
<br><b>&raquo; Electric Current in A Magnetic Field (Line Through Rings)</b>. 
The bars and rings.</li> 
<li><b>Weak Force</b>. Allows radioactive decay and holds protons and neutron 
in the nucleus and electrons in their orbits.<br>
<b>&raquo; W+</b>. The 
positively charged goat's hair layer. Asymmetric (5+6 panels).<br>
<b>&raquo; W-
</b>. The negatively charged linen layer. Asymmetric (different materials) <br>

<b>&raquo; Z0</b>. This assymetric forces allows radioactive decay by letting 
particles out of the nucleus. It is the two doorways that let particles out of 
the nucleus. It is assymetric because of the 4 and 5 columns.</li> 
<li><b>Graviton</b>. A hypothetical particle that causes the effects of 
gravity.<br>
<b>&raquo; Ram Skin and Porpoise Skin Layers</b>. The mishkan 
predicts that two forces model gravity and they are magnetic, radioactive and 
without mass.</li> 
<li><b>Higgs Boson</b>. A hypothetical particle that causes the effects of 
mass.<br>
<b>&raquo; Mass</b>. The Mishkan does not support the idea of a

Periodic table blocks and their size and properties.</p>

</ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Atoms</b>. One of the smallest items in the universe is an atom. Over 
100 atoms have been discovered and the smallest of these is hydrogen.<br>
 An 
atom is made up of a nucleus in the center, inside the nucleus are protons and 
neutrons. Circling the nucleus in orbit is the electron. The electron has a 
negative charge, the proton is positive and the neutron has no charge.</p> 
<p> <b>Light</b>. Light is the visible part of the electromagnetic waves. 
These are made by photons. Photons are released when electrons move from one 
orbit to another.</p> 
<p> <b>Color</b>. White light from the sun is made up of many colors. Seeing 
these colors depends on what the object does to the light that reaches it. The 
color of the object we see is the color of the light it reflects because the 
eye recognizes the primary colors of light. We see color by two methods:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Subtraction</b>. The object absorbs some color or subtracts it from the 
light and reflects the other colors that we see. This is how color pigments 
like paint and crayon work. Cyan absorbs red. Yellow absorbs blue. Magenta 
absorbs green.</li> 
<li><b>Addition</b>. Color is created by adding the different colors of light. 
All other colors are absorbed. The combination of all colors is white because 
no light is absorbed. When all light is absorbed the color we see is black. 
Black objects should also be hotter because when they absorb light they are 
absorbing energy. Color Reflects Absorbs <br>

Color science is used to 
illustrate salvation laws <br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Primary Colors</b>. In all color schemes it takes three primary colors 
to make all colors. But primary colors cannot be formed by mixing other colors. 
How color is made depends on the color system or whether we are using pigments 
or light.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Light (Additive Color)</b><br>
 Red, green and blue are the primary 
colors of light. Mixing any two or more colors gives a brighter color or more 
light. Red and blue make magenta (light purple). Green and red make yellow. 
Green and blue make cyan (light blue). White is the combination of all colors 
of light. Black is the absence of all light.<br>
<br>
Red Yellow Green Cyan Blue
Magenta Red White <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Pigments (Subtractive Color)</b><br>
 Red, blue and yellow are the 
three classic primary colors. They are used to make secondary colors. Red and 
yellow make orange. Blue and yellow make green. Red and blue make purple. White 
is the combination of all colors. Black is the absence of all colors. Red Orange
Yellow Green Blue Purple Red White <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Paints, inks, dyes (Subtractive Color)</b><br>
 Cyan, magenta and 
yellow are the three primary colors. Cyan and magenta make blue. Cyan and 
yellow make green. Magenta and yellow make red. Yellow Green Cyan Blue Magenta 
Red Yellow Black <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> Red Yellow Green <br>
White Cyan <br>
Magenta Blue <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> The additive and subtractive color systems are related. Two primary colors 
from one system creates a primary color in the other system. This is the 
combination of both.</p> White Yellow Green Cyan Blue Magenta Red Yellow Green 
Black <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Color Wheel</b>. An arrangement of 
colors in a circle. Red Yellow Green <br>
Cyan Blue Magenta <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <b>Complementary Color</b>. Colors directly opposite each other on the 
color wheel.<br>
Mixing two different complementary colors of light gives white 
light. If a color is absorbed, what your eye will see is the complementary 
color, which will be a mixture of all the light that is not absorbed.<br>
<br>

<b>Prism</b>. A prism is a three dimensional glass pyramid that separates white 
light into its component colors to form a rainbow. White light enters the prism 
and each color bends at a different angle, separating the colors. Different 
objects bend light at a different angle. So when light travels from air through 
glass or water the light exits at a different angle.<br>
<b>Rainbow</b>. A 
rainbow is caused when white light is broken up into its component colors as it 
passes from the air through water droplets which act like a prism. The classic 
colors of the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.

See how theeye processes color and the problems that result in color deficiency.
<p></p> 
<p> </p> <b>Imagine</b>  Our visible light is a fairly narrow frequency band. 
Suppose God and the angels have the ability to operate at other frequencies so 
that we can not see them. God said that He has to separate Himself from us 
physically because close contact would destroy us. Do you suppose God normally 
operates above the gamma ray frequencies? Suppose He can change frequencies at 
will so that He can be visible and invisible as He chooses? <br>
<br>
<b>What 
do you think?</b> Since God created the sun, moon and stars on the fourth day, 
the light that He made on the first day may have been caused by photons.<br>

But since God is a source of light, his presence may have caused the light. 
However, the universe is bathed in at least two other kinds of energy and it 
has a microwave background radiation. Are these or the microwave radiation the 
source of light on the first day? If so, then we have lost the ability to 
detect this energy with our eyes. Sin made us partially blind. <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> <b>Forces of Attraction</b><br>
</p>  Did you know that God used the 
science of color combination to illustrate the Plan of Salvation? <br>
He will 
take us from darkness to light through the Word. The Word He spoke to implement 
the plan was Jesus Christ. He was also the One Who created the world and He 
will recreate it again. <br>

Designer</b>  The fact that solar systems, galaxies and cells follow this 
structure points to a designer. Each has a central core which is encircled by 
other bodies in orbit. You would not expect such order from random events. <br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> Different types of forces are used to hold different systems together: </p>
<ol> 
<li> <b>Strong force</b>. Also called the nuclear force, it holds the nucleus 
of an atom together against the strong forces of repulsion from the protons.
</li> 
<li> <b>Weak force</b>. The weak force holds protons and neutrons in the 
nucleus.</li> 
<li> <b>Electromagnetic force</b>. Holds several atoms together when they 
create a molecule.</li> 
<li> <b>Gravity</b>. Is the weakest force. It holds large objects together. It 
keeps the planets in orbit and it keeps you from flying off the earth.</li> 
<li> <b>Love</b>. Holds people and intelligent life together. It is the 
character that is most like Him that God is trying to teach us.<br>
 The Bible 
simply says that &quot;God is Love&quot;.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Electricity</b><br>
 Electricity is produced when the atoms produce a 
flow of electrons in one direction.</p> 
<p> <b>Magnets</b><br>
 A magnetic force is created in another direction when 
an electrical force is turned on.</p> 
<p> <b>Chemistry: Atoms and Molecules</b><br>
 One of the most important 
things in chemistry is the periodic table of elements. It helps us to know how 
the elements will react.<br>
<b>Periodic Law</b>: When elements (atoms) are 
arranged in order of increasing atomic weight their properties are repeated 
periodically.<br>
 The periodic table is divided into 7 rows called 
&quot;periods&quot; and 18 columns called &quot;groups or families&quot;.</p> 
<b>Chemistry</b>  The process of combining atoms to form new solids, liquids 
and gases. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Groups Or Families</b>. Columns of elements 
that are related by the number of valence electrons in their outer shell. There 
are three grouping systems.
<ul> 
<li><b>New IUPAC</b>. Numbers the families from 1 to 18. </li> 
<li><b>Old IUPAC (Europe)</b>. &quot;S&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are numbered 
1A-8A. &quot;D&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are numbered 1B-8B.</li> 
<li><b>CAS (North America)</b>. Numbered 1A-8A and 1B-8B. </li> </ul>

<b>
Group (New IUPAC Number)</b>. Number of electrons in the outer shells. <br>
<b>
Block</b>. They have the same orbiting shell and the same set of groups. <br>

<b>Shell</b>. The electrons orbit singly or in pairs in different levels called 
shells. They are named by a series of four letters, &quot;S&quot;, 
&quot;P&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, and &quot;F&quot;. By looking at the periodic 
table you can tell which type of orbit is probably in the outermost valence 
shell. Metals are in the &quot;S&quot; block, transition metals are in the 
&quot;D&quot; block, non-metals are in the &quot;P&quot; block and the rare 
earth elements are in the &quot;F&quot; block. These shells are filled 
according to rules.
<ul> 
<li>Electrons fill orbits of lower energy first. </li> 
<li><b>Pauli Exclusion Principle</b>. Two electrons in the same orbit must 
have opposite spins.</li> 
<li><b>Hund's Rule</b>. Electrons fill empty orbits before pairing up. </li> 
<li><b>Octet Rule</b>. Atoms become especially stable when their valence 
shells are full. They tend to want 8 electrons in their outer shell and they 
will gain, share or lose electrons to complete this octet. Those with less than 
4 lose their electrons, those with 4 share electrons and those greater than 4 
tend to gain electrons to complete the octet.</li> </ul> <b>Valence Shell</b>. 
The outermost &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; orbit shells of an atom or the 
&quot;d&quot; shells in transition metals. It determines how atoms behave in a 
reaction. Here, electrons are gained, shared or lost to form chemical bonds 
because the elements are trying to achieve a status in which their shells are 
complete. Elements with the same number of valence electrons have the same 
properties. Each element has a number of valence electrons equal to its group 
number.<br>
<b>Transition Elements</b>. The transition metals are the only 
elements that fill the &quot;d&quot; orbitals. They have the same arrangement 
of outer electrons, but the lower &quot;3d&quot; orbitals are different. The 
ten &quot;3d&quot; orbitals are filled before the lower &quot;s&quot; orbital.

<p> Temperature is generated by the movement of atoms. Absolute Zero 
(0&ordm;K) (-459.67&ordm;F and -273.15&ordm;C) is the temperature when no 
molecular activity occurs and the volume of the &quot;perfect gas&quot; 
vanishes.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Experiment</b>  Bake a cake. The air bubbles that are released 
when the baking powder reacts with the flour causes the cake to rise. Cooking

<p></p> 
<p> Two or more atoms form a molecule. Knowing how these will react is the 
study of Chemistry.</p> <br>
<b>Designer</b> <b>Stereochemistry</b>. Did you 
know that complex molecules can have a mirror image twin. They look the same 
and react differently. The body is able to recognize them because they are 
oriented in the wrong direction. It is like trying to put a left handed glove 
on the right hand. The body uses the left handed versions while laboratory 
chemical reaction always produces the right handed version. When we die, these 
chemicals change to the right hand versions. <br>
 So how did random chemical 
reactions in nature consistently produce thousands of impossible compounds 
needed for life? <br>
<br>
 Biological systems are made from very complicated 
chemical reactions involving millions of chemicals and large molecules with 
many atoms. These systems are so complex and specific that a malfunction of any 
one chemical in millions can damage the creature.<br>
 The most important 
molecule is water. It is made from two hydrogen and one oxygen atom (H2O). <br>

 Some rare elements are expensive (gold (Au), silver (Ag), Copper (Cu) and 
Platinum (Pt)). They are used to make jewelry and coins.<br>
Other elements 
like Uranium (U) are precious because they are needed for nuclear weapons.

<p> <b>Color</b><br>
 Color can be caused by many different interactions of 
light or heat with different elements. Metal ions, oxides, sulfides, halides 
and chlorides of metals and organic compounds are used as coloring agents. 
Metal oxides are generally used in glass and metal chlorides in fireworks.<br>
 
The transition metals tend to be coloring elements because the electrons in 
their outer &quot;d&quot; orbit absorb light to move from one orbit to another.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Idiochromatic (&quot;Self-colored&quot;)</b>. The chemical composition 
of the material.</li> 
<li><b>Allochromatic (&quot;Other-colored&quot;)</b>. Impurities, defects or 
substition of an element.</li> 
<li><b>Pseudochromatic (&quot;False color&quot;)</b>. Color is caused by the 
crystal structure. e.g. Water or trapped air can act like a prism.</li> 
<li><b>Conjugated Bonds</b>. Large molecules, especially of carbon rings 
joined with nitrogen and oxygen, share electrons in single and double bonds. 
These shared electrons are more sensitive to light. e.g. Organic dyes, 
pigments, most plant and animal colors, chlorophyl, blood, lapis lazuli, fabric 
brighteners, fireflies.<br>
<b>Metalo-Organic Compounds</b>. Three very 
important compounds are used to transport oxygen in various living systems. The 
colors of these compounds are associated with the metal they contain.
<ul> 
<li><b>Hemoglobin (Fe)</b>. Transports oxygens in animals. It is bright red 
when it carries oxygen and dark red when it is not.<br>
<b>&raquo; Myoglobin 
(Fe)</b>. Stores oxygen in muscle, not transports it. Has red or dark grey 
color.<br>
<b>&raquo; Hemerythrin (Fe-O-Fe)</b>. Oxygen transport in 
sipunculids, brachiopods, priapulids and annelids. It gives a pink or violet 
color when oxygenated and clear when it is not.<br>
<b>&raquo; Leghemoglobin 
(Fe)</b>. Binds oxygen to protect nitrogen fixing bacteria in the roots of 
legumes.</li> 
<li><b>Hemocyanin (Cu)</b>. The second most common oxygen transporting protein 
found in nature. It is in the blood of arthropods (insects, spiders, 
crustaceans) and molluscs. It is pale yellow when not combined with oxygen, and 
blue when combined with oxygen.</li> 
<li><b>Chlorophyll (Mg)</b>. A green compound involved in the process of 
photosynthesis.</li> 
<li><b>Vanabins (V)</b>. In the blood of sea squirts may be the oxygen 
carriers.</li>

Front No Pigment Lipofuscin Melanin <br>
Back Blood No Pigment Melanin <br>
<br>
<b>Eye Color</b>. Eye color is a complex interaction of at least two genes and 
the concentration of pigments on the front and back surface of the iris and the 
natural grey color of the iris and the size and spacing of the fibers in the 
eye. Genes also create the flecks, specks and rings that dot the eyes.<br>

Melanin, a brown pigment which is controlled by the brown-blue gene on 
chromosome 15 and the green-blue gene on chromosome 19, is mainly responsible 
for the range in eye color.<br>
Lipofuscin, a yellow pigment produced by aging, 
is responsible for green and amber eyes. The natural color of the iris and the 
blood vessels at the back of the eye also contribute to the color.
<ul> 
<li><b>Grey</b>. No melanin, the natural color of the iris tissue. </li> 
<li><b>Violet and Pink</b>. No melanin, the natural color of the iris tissue 
and the red blood vessels.</li> 
<li><b>Blue</b>. Little lipofuscin and little to no melanin. </li> 
<li><b>Green</b>. Some melanin and a lot of lipofuscin. These eyes can look 
golden.</li> 
<li><b>Amber</b>. High concentration of lipofuscin. </li> 
<li><b>Hazel</b>. A mixture of pigments in several parts of the eye. </li> 
<li><b>Brown</b>. High concentration of melanin. </li> 
<li><b>Dark Brown - Black</b>. Highest concentration of melanin, probably on 
both surfaces of the iris.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>  In the womb, all babies of all races have grey eyes. Eye color develops 
after birth when the melanin is exposed to light.</p> 
<p> <b>Hair And Skin Color</b>. Human skin color is due to melanin, but hair 
color is due to Eumelanin for black and brown colors and Phaeomelanin for red 
and yellow colors. The low concentration or absence of either pigment causes 
gray or white hair.<br>
<b>Birds</b>. Feather color is due to the structure of 
the feathers and the pigments. The feather scatters reflected light and affects 
the color because the distance between the melanin and air cavities is smaller 
than the wavelength of light. Blue and green color in animals is created this 
way. There are four types of pigments:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Melanin</b>. (Brown, black, gray, yellows). </li> 
<li><b>Porphyrins</b>. A rare pigment creates green. </li> 
<li><b>Psittacins</b>. (Red, orange, yellow). </li> 
<li><b>Carotenoids</b>. (Red, orange, yellow). <br>
 Flamingos are born white, 
but the carotenoids in their diet of algae and small fish gives them the pink 
color.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Fish</b>. Color is achieved by the pigment cells and how many layers of 
skin in which they occur. These four chromatophores are melanin (black), 
xanthin (yellow), lipochrome (orange), and erythrin (red).</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Imagine</b>  Will our skin, hair and eye color change with our 
emotions or at our will? <br>

<br>
 The 
colors of autumn leaves are due to changing concentrations of many chemicals. 
Decreasing light levels in autumn causes chlorophyll production to slow and 
other pigments emerge in this order as the green color fades.
<ul> <b>Chlorophyll</b>. It gives a green color and masks all other pigment 
colors.<br>
<b>Anthocyanin</b>. Sugar concentration increases and anthocyanin 
production increases, giving the leaves a pink, red, blue or purple color.<br>

<b>Carotenoids</b>. Carotenoids and xanthophyll give the leaves a yellow color 
and a mixture of carotenoids and anthocyanin gives an orange color.<br>
<b>
Tannins</b>. They give a brown color. When the major pigments are absent other 
chemicals affect leaf color.</ul>

<ul> 
<li> <b>Aurora</b>. The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) occurs above 50 
miles (80 km) because of the charged particles in the Ionosphere.</li> 
<li> <b>Space Shuttle</b>. The space shuttle files about 150 miles (241 km) 
above the earth. It takes about 46 hours for the shuttle to reach the space 
station travelling at 17580 mph (28287 kph) in orbit and 4973 mph (8002 kph) 
during launch.</li> 
<li> <b>Space Station</b>. The space station is about 200 miles (322 km) up. 
</li> 
<li> <b>New Jerusalem</b>. Contrast this to the city of the New Jerusalem 
which is 1500 miles high (2400 km). Some sources say 375 miles high (603 km). 
Whichever is correct it is a very big city that can reach far beyond the space

(100 Km).</li> 
<li> <b> Thermosphere</b>. 50 - 60 miles (80-97 km) </li> 
<li> <b> Mesosphere</b>. 35 to 50 miles (56-80 km) is the coldest layer. </li> 
<li> <b> Stratosphere</b>. From 10 to 35 miles (16-56 km). The ozone layer is 
in this zone between 9.5 to 12.5 miles (15 to 20 km). It protects us from

<p></p> 
<p> <b>Weather</b><br>
 Our weather is affected by the large amount of water 
exposed to the heat from the sun. Warm air rises and cold air falls, causing a 
cycle of flowing air. The combination of air mass, pressure, the flow of air, 
moisture from the oceans and lakes and ocean temperature creates our global 
weather patterns.<br>

 A block of air with the same temperature and moisture. The boundary of an air 
mass is called the &quot;front&quot;. At the boundary of two fronts, the 
difference in the air causes the most severe weather as the molecules try to 
reach equilibrium.
<ul> 
<li> <b>Polar Cells (Arctic Air Mass)</b>. Located between 60&ordm; and the 
pole. Cold air from the poles descends and releases rain as it heats up and 
rises near the arctic circle. It creates the polar easterlies.</li> 
<li> <b>Ferrel Cells</b>. It is located between 30&ordm; and 60&ordm; north 
and south latitude</li> 
<li> <b>Hadley Cells</b>. Hot air from the equator rises in the doldrums and 
descends at latitude 25-30&ordm; north and south. The northward flow deflects 
to the right, due to coriolis, and becomes a westerly flow in the upper layers.
<br><b>Coriolis Effect</b>. The rotation of the earth causes wind and water 
motion to deflect to the right (clockwise) of the direction of motion in the 
north and to the left (counter clockwise) in the southern hemisphere.</li> 
<li> <b>Doldrums</b>. A region of stagnant air near the equator between

<br> 
<p> <b>Air Flow</b>. Winds are named by the direction from which they flow. 
</p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Jet Stream</b>. A current of fast moving air flowing west to east 
found at 10-15 km (6-9 miles) in the upper levels of the atmosphere at a speed 
of 56-400 miles per hour. It separates a mass of cold air in the north from a 
warm air mass in the south.
<ul> 
<li> <b>Pineapple Express</b>. A weather system originating in the Hawaiian 
tropics that brings rain to the west coast of the United States. The jet stream 
bends to the south over the Pacific Ocean picking up warm moist air which 
condenses and brings waves of rain to the Pacific Northwest.</li> 
<li> <b>Siberian Express</b>. The polar jet steam turns south and brings cold 
arctic air to the southern part of the United States.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li> <b>Trade Winds</b>. These are the lower level winds from the Equatorial 
Hadley cells which blow from the east to the west. The rising warm air in the 
tropics creates a void that is filled by air coming from higher latitudes, 
causing the trade winds. As the trade winds cross over Africa, they form the 
disturbances that form hurricanes.</li> 
<li> <b>Westerlies</b>. Winds that blow from the west to the east in the 
temperate region. They are caused by the trade winds which are reflected and 
turn toward the poles and loop back east.</li> 
<li> <b>Easterlies</b>. Arctic polar air moves from the poles and creates 
turbulence in the air when it meets a warm front moving in the opposite 
direction. This exchange of heat releases rain, hail and other weather 
phenomenon.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Ocean Temperature</b><br>
 Ocean temperature affects the weather by 
bringing moisture and changing the temperature of the air.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Ocean Conveyor Belt (Thermohaline Circulation)</b>. This acts as the 
ocean's circulatory system and distributes tropical heat around the planet. 
This is a 1600 year cycle that imports warm surface water from the Pacific and 
sinks cold deep salt water from the Atlantic near Greenland. The North Atlantic 
and Southern Ocean give their cold deep waters and nutrients to the Pacific and 
the warm surface waters, driven by surface winds, sink to replace it.<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Nordic Heat Pump (Atlantic Heat Conveyor)</b>. Heat moves from the 
Caribbean and the tropical South Atlantic to the North Atlantic along the Ocean 
Conveyor belt. Heat is pumped into the Nordic sea and gives Europe warm 
temperatures by a transfer of heat from the sea to the air.<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Gulf Stream</b>. Warm ocean current in the north Atlantic that flows 
north east from Cape Hatteras near Florida, to Newfoundland and then towards 
Britain. It brings warm air to northern Europe, a region of the earth that 
should normally be cool. Global warming is affecting the gulf stream. Warm air 
melts the polar ice caps and sends chunks of ice into the sea. This cools the 
water in the north and counteracts the warming effect of the gulf stream.<br>

</li> 
<li><b>El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a</b>. Periodically, major changes in 
the global weather pattern occur because of the changes in the temperature of 
the Pacific ocean surface water near the coast of Peru.<br>
 Normally, cold air 
from the arctic and Antarctic circle converges at the equator off the coast of 
Peru and heads west towards Indonesia. If it is stalled by a high pressure 
system over Indonesia, the cold air stops flowing and water near Peru heats up. 
The opposite happens with La Ni&ntilde;a. Changes in the Peru current (Humboldt 
current) creates the cyclical changes in weather pattern.
<ul>

 This is a representation of the second day of 
creation.<br>
 God is separating the waters that are part of Himself. The lower 
layers will remain to form the seas and the upper layers will remain with Him. 
They form the heavens that cover our universe. They are not the clouds we see. 
Our sky is only a little representation of what it looks like if God hovered 
over us.<br>
<br>
 Just as a baby is surrounded by amniotic fluid in the womb, 
our universe was born out of the waters of God. <br>

 March 25, 2000. 
The USA &quot;IMAGE&quot; satellite is the first weather satellite for space 
storms. It studies the effects of solar wind on the earth's magnetic sphere. 
<br> <br>
 When water condenses (forms liquid) it is called different things 
depending on where it forms.
<ul> 
<li><b>Air</b>. Clouds </li> 
<li><b>Near the Ground</b>. Fog or mist </li> 
<li><b>Ground</b>. Dew. <br>
 After creation, the earth was watered by ground 
level clouds. Air level clouds existed after the flood.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Clouds bring much of the weather we experience. There are different 
formations of clouds. A cloud is a collection of water droplets or ice 
crystals. They are formed when water evaporates from the surface of the earth. 
As this moist air rises it expands and cools because of the lower pressure of 
the upper atmosphere. Cooler air holds less water.<br>
<br>
 Clouds are named 
based on their appearance, contents and the altitude (height) at which they 
form. They have at least one of the following characteristics in their 
appearance.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Cirrus</b>. A tuft or filament. </li> 
<li><b>Cumulus</b>. A heap or pile </li> 
<li><b>Stratus</b>. Forms a layer </li> 
<li><b>Nimbus</b>. Rain bearing clouds </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Clouds are named by combining the descriptions of several of these 
features.</p> 
<p> <b>Pyrocumulonimbogeostratus Megacell</b>. This is the name we created for 
the cloud that surrounds God. It is a huge fire producing system of clouds that 
covers the earth and rains fire.<br>
 God always describes Himself as being 
surrounded with fire, clouds, rainbow, a blue floor and elements from the 
weather. He is His own gigantic weather system. Lightning and thunder come from 
His throne. This weather system can rain fire and stone.<br>
What would you 
name it?</p> 
<p> <b>Smog</b>. A cloud formation that has occurred since the twentieth 
century because of the burning of fossil fuels in cars and electric plants. It 
is a mixture of exhaust gases, dust and moisture in the air that generally 
forms over big cities situated in valleys. In these locations, the air is not 
easily refreshed by winds. The air remains trapped in the valleys because it 
cannot get over the high mountains. So, since these clouds of pollution can 
travel thousands of miles, this same problem causes pollution to be trapped in 
the mountains, forests and national parks.<br>
<br>
 The air quality changes 
because of the amount of modern pollution in the atmosphere from automobiles 
and factories. This caused scientists to develop a system to measure the air 
quality. It was necessary because ozone damages the lungs and quickly affects 
the breathing of people with respiratory illnesses. On hot summer days when 
there is no rain, the air quality becomes the most dangerous. Five causes of 
pollution are measured.</p> Air Quality Index <br>
Color Code AQI  Category <br>
Green 1 - 50  Good <br>
Yellow 51 - 100  Moderate <br>
Orange 101 - 150

<b>Sulfur 
Dioxide</b>. Over 69.4% is produced by industrial combustion. 3.7% is caused by 
transportation.<br>
<b>Oxides of Nitrogen</b>. Transportation causes 43% of 
this pollution. Industry causes 32% <br>
<b>Environmentalist</b>. Protects the 
environment through public awareness and legal action <br>
<b>Human Rights 
Monitor</b>. Protects exploited people through public awareness and legal action
<br> <b>Eudiometer</b>. Measures air purity <br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li><b>Ground level Ozone (O3)</b>. Ozone in the upper atmosphere protects the 
planet from ultraviolet radiation, but it is hazardous near the surface. 
Remember &quot;Ozone is good up high, bad near by&quot;. Ozone is created as 
the pollution interacts with the sun. Therefore, levels are higher in the 
summer.</li> 
<li><b>Particulate Matter (soot and dust)</b>. These are tiny solid particles 
suspended in the air.</li> 
<li><b>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</b>. Creates acid rain with sulfuric acid (H2SO4). 
</li> 
<li><b>Oxides of Nitrogen (NO and NO2)</b>. Nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen 
dioxide. They attack the respiratory system and damage the ozone. They create 
acid rain with nitric and nitrous acid (HNO3 and HNO2). <br>
<br>
<b>Acid Rain
</b>. A cloud of smog produces acid rain which kills lakes and forests. Any 
precipitation with pH less than 5.6 is acid rain. This rain kills young fishes 
and insects, pine needles and strips the wax coat from a leaf. Animals who eat 
insects die when their food supply is gone. Fish die when their young babies do 
not grow up. Acid reacts with minerals in the soil and strips away the 
nutrients that plants need. It also releases heavy metals that are normally 
trapped by the soil.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Climate Change: </b> Pollution has contributed to several global 
effects on our planet.</p> 
<ul> Greenhouse Gas % Gas <br>
Water  65% <br>
Carbon Dioxide  33% <br>
Methane
 2% <br>
Nitrous Oxide <br>
Ozone <br>
<br>

<li><b>Hole in the Ozone Layer</b>. In 1985, scientists discovered a hole in 
the ozone layer. In 2003, the South Pole ozone hole was over 11 million square 
miles (28.5 square Km). This is an area three times larger than the United 
States.</li> 
<li><b>Greenhouse Effect</b>. The warming of the lower atmosphere because of 
carbon dioxide and water vapor. This causes the rays of the sun to heat the 
earth and prevents heat from escaping back into space. The greenhouse effect 
has caused global warming and unpredictable climate changes.</li> 
<li><b>Greenhouse Gases</b>. Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect by 
absorbing infrared heat from the sun. Such as, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2
), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), Ozone (O3) and artificial chemicals like 
fluorocarbons. Carbon dioxide lasts for over 100 years in the atmosphere, while 
methane lasts for ten years. But methane can trap heat 21 times better than 
carbon dioxide. This causes it to create 18% of the greenhouse effect even 
though it is at a low concentration.</li> 
<li><b>Glaciers Melting and Polar Warming</b>. In the past century, many 
glaciers have disappeared. In 2002 a shelf of ice broke off Antarctica. It is 
100 miles long and 40 miles wide (160 Km by 64 Km). The glaciers of Mt. 
Kilimanjaro will melt by 2020. They have melted 80% since 1912. The Glacier 
National Park in Montana has only 30 smaller glaciers remaining from the 150 
that existed in 1910. All will melt before the end of the century.</li> 
<li><b>Oceans Warming and Rising</b>. The warming oceans change weather 
patterns. In a forty year period the amount of energy used to warm up the ocean 
was equivalent to the amount of energy that it would take to run California for 
200,000 years. This energy did not come from the sun. The only explanation is 
that heat is being trapped by greenhouse gases. Global warming increases 
storms, droughts and other extreme weather events, floods low lying coasts, and 
drown entire island nations as the seas rise because glaciers are melting.</li> 
<li><b>Acidic Oceans</b>. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic 
acid.</li> 
<li><b>Coral Bleaching</b>. As temperatures get above 85&ordm;F (29.5&ordm;C) 
bleaching occurs in the coral reefs and they lose algae and other organisms and 
die. The Body Earth <br>

</li> 
<li><b>Eroding Natural Defences</b>. The Earth's natural defences against 
disaster are being eroded or destroyed.
<ul> 
<li><b>Forests</b>. Absorb the rain. Deforestation causes mudslides and soil 
erosion.</li> 
<li><b>Mangroves</b>. Protect coasts. </li> 
<li><b>Wetlands</b>. Soak up flood water. </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Heat Wave</b>. By the year 2003, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2001 and 1997 were 
the five hottest years on the planet since record keeping began in the 1880's.
</li> 
<li><b>Weather Extremes</b>. Storms are more frequent and more powerful and 
occur in areas never seen. Weather temperatures are also wavering between 
extremes. Blizzards are stronger and longer and occur in normally warm places. 
Cold climates experience warmer temperatures during winter and warm locations 
experience severe winters as the Jet stream is pushed and pulled across the 
globe.</li> 
<li><b>Oxygen Imbalance</b>. 70% of our oxygen comes from the ocean. Oxygen is 
absorbed when the water is cold. So, as the ocean temperature increases it 
depletes the oxygen and leads to the death of marine life. In addition, the 
main source of oxygen is gone. Where does this oxygen go? It is probably 
trapped in the excess carbon dioxide which causes global warming.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> As this information becomes more political than scientific, proponents 
offer up information that is designed to ignore the warming trend and stop 
efforts to start making personal changes before it is too late.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Glaciers Melting</b>. The best evidence that the planet is experiencing 
an overall warming trend that may be irreversible is the continued melting and 
disappearance of old glaciers.</li> 
<li><b>Previous Temperature Spikes</b>. Those against global warming point to 
previous cooling trends as natural cycles from which the earth will rebound. 
They fail to mention that none of these cycles removed ice fields that are 
thousands of years old, or millions of years old (evolution). Two catastrophic 
volcanic eruptions around 535 AD and 1815 AD also caused a cooling trend. One 
in 1783 caused a cooling trend in Europe.</li> 
<li><b>Data Mismanagement</b>. Some climate change scientists have been caught 
trying to suppress climate cooling data. They do the same thing in the creation 
and evolution debate by suppressing inconvenient data. In the case of climate 
temperatures the answer may lie in where temperature collectors were placed. 
Those in the cities registered warmer temperatures and those in the rural areas 
were cooler. These might indicate that scientists need to find a better way to 
measure real overall temperature trends, not the immediate effects of 
industrial activity.</li> </ul>

Precipitation falls from clouds to 
the ground in several forms.
<ol> 
<li><b>Rain</b>. Water or other liquid </li> 
<li><b>Snow</b>. Small ice crystals </li> 
<li><b>Sleet</b>. Icy Rain </li> 
<li><b>Hail</b>. Chunks of ice </li> </ol> When precipitation falls in a large 
volume or at a fast rate it creates a storm. A persistent lack of precipitation 
over time creates drought. The Palmer index measures water balance by 
considering supply, demand and loss. That is precipitation, transpiration and 
evaporation and run off. <br>
 Ten inches (25 cm) of snow can contain 0.10 to 
four inches of water (.25-10 cm).<br>
 With strong winds, ten inches of snow 
contains about one inch of water. <br>
<b>Hyetometer, Udometer</b>. Measures 
rainfall <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Tropical Cyclones</b>. A low pressure system 
originating in the tropics with thunderstorms and a circulation of winds near 
the Earth's surface around the low pressure. They are classified by the wind 
speed. The Atlantic storm season occurs between June 1 and November 30.<br>

They form in the region that is 5&ordm; to 30&ordm; latitude for these reasons.
<ol> 
<li><b>Moisture</b>. They are close enough to the warm waters of the equator 
to gain moisture.</li> 
<li><b>Rotation</b>. Only at that location does the rotation of the earth 
cause the air mass to get a spin. The radius of the earth in that region 
changes sharply. Therefore, the wider end spins at a slower rate. The 
difference in spin at both ends of the cloud causes the air mass to rotate.</li>
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> There are three categories of cyclones based on the wind speed. </p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Tropical Depressions</b>. Have winds of less than 17 metres a second 
or 38 miles per hour (mph).</li> 
<li> <b>Tropical Storms</b>. Have winds between 17 and 33 metres a second or 
39-73 mph.</li> 
<li> <b>Hurricane</b>. A tropical storm in the Atlantic with wind speed over 
33 metres per second, 119 kph or 74 miles per hour. They form in waters in the 
ocean that are about 80&ordm; between latitude 5&ordm; and 30&ordm; and move 
west then north. Hurricanes that are south of the equator spin in a clockwise 
direction, while those in the north spin in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
<b>
Storm Names</b>. They are named by the region in which they originate. 
Hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean are assigned a different set of names than 
Atlantic storms. Tropical storms are given names in alphabetical order and 
alternate between masculine and feminine names. This list rotates every six 
years for each regional group.<br>
<br>
 High speed tropical storms which 
originate in other oceans also have different titles.
<ul> 
<li> <b>Hurricane</b>. North Atlantic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean east of the 
dateline, and the South Pacific Ocean east of 160&ordm;E. (July - October).<br>

&raquo;<b>Pacific Hurricanes</b>. Around September, they form in the warm water 
off Central America and move west into the Pacific and rarely make landfall. 
These have a different set of names.</li> 
<li> <b>Typhoon</b>. Northwest Pacific Ocean west of the dateline. (July - 
October)</li> 
<li> <b>Cyclone</b>. Southwest Pacific Ocean west of 160&ordm;E or Southeast 
Indian Ocean east of 90&ordm;E, North Indian Ocean and in the Southwest Indian 
Ocean. (December - May).</li> 
<li> <b>Willy Willies</b>. Australia. (November - March). </li> </ul> </li> 
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Funnel Cloud</b>. A funnel cloud is a vortex of condensed water vapor 
and air spinning at high velocity.</p> 
<p> <b>Tornado or Twister</b>. A huge, swirling vortex of rapidly rotating air 
that contacts the ground. It is caused by a rotating storm system rather than 
by local wind rotation. It is called a funnel if it does not contact the 
ground. When it forms on the water it is called a water spout. They are formed 
during a thunderstorm.<br>
 The storm is rated on the Fujita Scale. While 
hurricanes may be hundreds of miles wide, a tornado may only be 150 feet wide 
and move across the surface at about 0-60 mph for about five minutes causing 
damage to a path up to 100 miles (160 km).</p> Saffir-Simpson Scale of

<b> Follow the Sun</b>. <br>
When the sun is directly 
overhead, there are long days, hot summers, high humidity or rainy season. <br>

<b>Solstice</b>. Sun is farthest north (summer solstice) or south (winter 
solstice) and hot weather occurs.<br>
<b>Equinox</b>. Sun is directly over the 
equator. Day and night are equal length. This occurs in spring and autumn. <br>

<br> The seasons are the result of the 23.45&ordm; tilt of the Earth's axis and 
angle at which the sun's rays strike the earth and the location of the sun, not 
our distance from the sun. This affects the number of daylight hours and the 
angle of the rays of the sun as they strike the earth and the amount of 
rainfall.
<ul> 
<li><b>Tilt Of The Earth</b>. The tilt causes rays of the sun to strike the 
Earth at a more direct angle during summer. This concentrates the rays in a 
smaller area and creates more heat. These hot conditions are best for creating 
thunderstorms and the rainy season. In the winter the rays strike at an angle 
and are spread out over a larger area causing cooler temperatures.</li> 
<li><b>Length Of The Day</b>. In winter the days are shorter, so there is less 
energy to heat up the earth. In summer the days are longer and more energy 
heats up the earth.</li> 
<li><b>Rain Belt</b>. Hot days creates thunderstorms in the tropical rain belt 
that extends between the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. It creates one long 
rainy season at the tropics and two wet and two dry seasons on the equator as 
the rain belt passes over twice a year, as it moves north and then south. The 
region in between may have one long and one short rainy season.</li> 
<li><b>Mediterranean Climate</b>. A special climate zone appears on the 
western coasts of large continents that are near large bodies of water. These 
conditions occur from December to February in the northern hemisphere and April 
to September in the south. They have rain with cool, mild, wet winters and dry 
summers. e.g. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Santiago, Adelaide, Perth, Capetown, 
Alexandria, Naples and Greece.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> There are six seasons which are created by the action of the sun affecting 
temperature and rain. This mix of seasons is dependent on the heat cycles in 
three basic locations, the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere and the 
equator.</p> 
<p> <b>Weather Instruments</b> Meteorologists use many types of instruments to 
measure temperature, water vapor, pressure and wind speed and direction.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Thermometer</b>. Measures air temperature. </li> 
<li><b>Rain Guage</b>. Measures the amount of rain that as fallen over a 
period of time.</li> 
<li><b>Hygromometer</b>. Measures humidity (amount of water vapor in the air). 
</li> 
<li><b>Sling Psychrometer</b>. Measures relative humidity with two 
thermometers.</li> 
<li><b>Barometer</b>. Measures air pressure. A rising barometer means sunny

 The 
continents of Australia, India, South America, Africa, and Antarctica, existed 
together as a single land floating on aquifers (underground rivers and lakes) 
before the flood. There were no large bodies of water like our oceans and at 
that time there was no rain. A mist used to come from the earth and water the 
plants.<br>
<br>
 According to the Bible, during the flood the foundations of 
the earth burst open and water came out. It was during this time that the 
continents probably broke apart. The Bible says that 100 years later the land 
was divided. People separated according to language. The earth probably was 
drifting apart. Native Americans could have easily gone from the Middle East to 
the American continent.<br>
<br>
 The earth seems to have tilted approximately 
4,000 years ago, at about the same time as the flood. It still has a wobble, 
suggesting that it was struck with great force. Science might explain this 
tilting as a result of an impact from an asteroid, and Creationists might 
explain the tilting by the action of God. At the time of the flood, God might 
have sent a great asteroid that struck the earth and broke the foundations and 
weakened the land along the lines of the plates and broke apart into the 
continents. Water from below rushed up to the surface and flooded the earth.<br>
<br> Evolutionists call this super continent Pangea. It is made from Gondwana 
in the south and Laurasia in the North. Pangea broke up into Gondwana (or 
Gondwanaland) which included South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and 
Australia, Florida and part of southwest Europe. Laurasia is made up of North 
America, Europe and Asia.<br>
<br>
 Australia is now moving away from 
Antarctica and is moving north towards Asia at about six centimetres per year 
and will be a part of Asia in about 40 million years.<br>
 But the Second 
Coming will change all this. In about 1000 years, the Earth will be recreated 
and will probably be one land floating on the sea. Australia will not crash 
into China. <b>Earth Sciences</b>  Geography is the study of the land.

<b>The Largest Earthquake</b>. 
The Earth is recovering from a wobble. By applying mathematical calculations 
that are based on causing a wobble in a spinning toy, it has been shown that 
this wobble occurred about 4000 years ago. Around the same time as the flood.
<br><br>
 The wobble was probably caused during the flood by an asteroid 
striking the earth and breaking the crust. This broke the tectonic plates, 
tilted the earth and caused huge tsunamis. <br>

<b>
Earthquake</b> <br>
 Earthquakes are caused by the shifting plates under the 
surface of the earth or by the movement of magma (melted rock that comes from 
volcanoes). Most plates travel at speeds of between 1 and 15 cm per year. When 
they move by each other, they cause an earthquake.<br>
<br>
<b>Fault Lines</b>. 
A break in the Earth along which movement occurs at the plates.<br>
<br>
<b>
Plate Tectonics</b>. The theory that relates most of the geologic features near 
the Earth's surface (Mountains, earthquakes and volcanoes) to the movement and 
interaction of thin plates of rock. There are four basic plate movements.
<ul> 
<li><b>Converging Boundary</b>. A region where two plates collide. 
<ul> 
<li><b>Deformation</b>. Two continental plates crash together but there is no 
volcanic activity. The region forms mountains. e.g. Himalayas.</li> 
<li><b>Subduction Zone</b>. A boundary where one plate slides under another. 
Usually the lighter continental plate slides over the heavier oceanic plate. 
This is a zone where volcanoes are prevalent and mountains form. e.g. Indonesia.
</li> 
<li><b>Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence</b>. Two oceanic plates collide and one 
slides under another producing volcanoes under the sea that create island arcs. 
e.g. Marianas Trench.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Transverse Boundary</b>. Plates slide by each other and create cracks 
called a fault. e.g. San Andreas Fault</li> 
<li><b>Spreading Boundary</b>. Plates move apart. The region has a lot of 
geothermal activity. e.g. Iceland.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Tsunami</b>. A large tidal wave caused by an underwater earthquake 
exceeding magnitude 7.5, underwater landslide, volcanic eruption, impact from a 
meteorite, or the impact caused by large rocks falling from a mountain into the 
sea. Land slides from volcanic islands are the most likely of these.</p> 
<p> <b>Liquefaction</b>. It occurs when soil behaves more like a liquid than a 
solid when it is saturated with water and loses it's strength and stiffness due 
to an earthquake or rapid increase in water pressure.</p> 
<p> <b>Volcano</b><br>
 The source through which molten rock flows out to the 
surface of the earth in the form of lava. Volcanoes are a conical hill or 
mountain built around a vent that connects with reservoirs of molten rock below 
the surface of the earth. They are built by the accumulation of the particles 
that erupt from them. These are lava (melted flowing rocks), bombs (crusted 
over ash flows), and tephra (airborne ash and dust).<br>
Lava exits the volcano 
through a central vein or through side fissures. Sometimes the lava solidifies 
in the side veins and form dikes. These support and strengthen the volcano. 
There are four types of volcanoes.</p> Volcano <br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li><b>Magma</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Ejected Particles</b>. 
<ol> 
<li><b>Lava</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Bombs</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Tephra</b>. </li> </ol> </li> 
<li><b>Other Flows</b>. 
<ol> 
<li><b>Pryoclastic flow</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Mud flows</b>. </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <br>
 Olympus Mons, on Mars, is 
the tallest volcano in the solar system. It is a shield volcano that rises 24 
km (78,000 feet). The base is more than 700 km in diameter. <br>
 There are 
about ten active volcanoes every day around the world. <br>
<b>Volcanologist</b>
. Studies volcanoes <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Cinder Cones</b>. They have a bowl shaped crater at the top. They are 
built from small fragments of lava that solidify and fall as cinders around the 
vent to form a circular or oval cone. (e.g. Par&iacute;cutin in Mexico)</li> 
<li><b>Composite Volcanoes (Stratovolcanoes)</b>. Large, steep, symmetrical 
cones built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, 
and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet (2440 meters) above their bases. 
(e.g. Mount St. Helens, Mount Fuji, Mount Hood. The upper 1200 feet (366 
meters) of Etna.</li> 
<li><b>Shield Volcanoes</b>. They are built almost entirely of fluid lava that 
forms a flat, gently sloping cone. (e.g. Etna, Mauna Loa and Kilauea)</li> 
<li><b>Lava Domes</b>. They are formed when the lava is too viscous to flow 
any great distance. So the lava piles up at its vent and the surface cools and 
cracks as lava from below is pushed out. (e.g. Mount Pel&eacute;e in Martinique)
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> Volcano products. </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Magma</b>. A river of melted rocks below the surface of the earth. It 
creates the flow of lava when it breaks the surface of the earth. The type of 
rock that creates the lava will affect the rate of the flow. Basalt lava and 
other extrusive rocks are very fluid and tend to form shield volcanos. 
Intrusive rocks do not flow easily and tend to form lava domes.</li> 
<li> <b>Pyroclastic Flow</b>. A fast moving, flowing avalanche of hot ashes, 
gases, rocks and debris which often accompany explosive eruptions. This often 
causes a mud flow as is rushes along the ground at speeds as high as 100 miles 
per hour (160 Km).</li> 
<li> <b>Lahars</b>. Corrosive rivers that form when rain mixes with the ashes. 
They remove vegetation and harden like concrete.</li> 
<li> <b>Caldera</b>. A crater with a depression caused by the collapse of a 
volcano.</li> 
<li> <b>Ring of Fire</b>. The line of volcanoes that circles most of the 
Pacific Ocean. A region where 75% of the Earth's active and dormant volcanoes 
are located. The ring appears to be on the edges of Pangea.</li> 
<li> <b>Hot Spot</b>. A hole in the tectonic plate through which lava flows. 
(e.g. Hawaii, Yellowstone) There are about thirty hot spots. Yellowstone is the 
only one on land.</li> 
<li> <b>Supervolcano</b>. A large volcano with the potential to spread ash 
thousands of miles and blot out the sun. Yellowstone is on a caldera that is 
the site of a magma chamber of a supervolcano. It is the largest volcano in the 
world. It is 80 km long and 40 km wide and 8 km deep. (50 x 25 x 5) miles.</li> 
<li> <b>Subduction Zone</b>. The region where one tectonic plate passes under 
another. The friction melts the rocks and creates lava and can cause megathrust 
earthquakes.</li> </ul>

<li><b>Intrusive</b>. Coarse grained rock. It is too thick to flow. (Gabbro, 
Diorite, Granodiorite, Granite)</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Metamorphic</b>. Forms when existing rock is changed by temperature, 
pressure or chemicals.
<ul> 
<li><b>Foliated</b>. Slate, schist, gneiss. </li> 
<li><b>Non-foliated</b>. Quartzite, marble </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Sedimentary</b>. Form by erosion of preexisting rock. This sediment 
turns into rock. This type of rock was made by the flood as water eroded 
existing rock and soil and mixed with the bones of the dead creatures.
<ul> 
<li><b>Clastic</b>. Shale, mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, breccia, 
conglomerate.</li> 
<li><b>Chemical</b>. Limestone, dolostone, evaporites. </li> 
<li><b>Biologic</b>. Coal, chert. Formed from decaying living materials. </li> 
</ul>  Granite - Genesis Rock <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Scientific Experiments <br>
Time
</b>  Dr. Robert Gentry studied granite rock and discovered that pleochroic 
haloes trapped in the rock were formed in less than three minutes. Probably 1.5 
minutes. Therefore, he concluded that granite changed from a liquid to a solid 
form in less than three minutes. <br>
 Granite rock did not cool over millions 
of years. It cooled in three minutes!<br>
Evolutionists are hoping that they 
can find another explanation for this. Because, if granite is reheated it forms 
another type of rock called rhyolite when it is cooled. So all the granite we 
see is in its original form on the day it was made. <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Genesis Rock</b>. Creationists recognize a fourth type of rock which 
does not fit any of the categories above. Granite is a rock which existed at 
creation. It cannot be formed by any of the three classifications. When granite 
is heated and cooled, it forms rhyolite. Therefore, any existing granite could 
not come from melted magma.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> How did the sedimentary rock layers form? The creationists claim that all 
we see is a result of the flood. Evolutionists claim that all these layers were 
formed over trillions of years.<br>
<br>
 The discovery of <b>turbidity currents
</b> changed this. They are only formed under water when large layers of mud 
slide across each other like an avalanche, building up layers in hours or days 
that scientists thought took millions of years.</p> 
<p> <b>Precious Stones</b><br>
 Gems are rare and so they are expensive. They 
are also prized because of their beautiful color. Diamond is made from carbon, 
the same element as coal. But, the diamond forms a crystal structure while coal 
is a random formation of the element. There are three sources of natural gems 
(animal, plant and minerals):<br>
<br>
<b>Animal Sources</b>. Organic source of 
pearl, coral and ivory.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Ivory</b>. It is the bone from elephants and rhinoceras tusks. </li> 
<li><b>Pearl</b>. It is made from fresh water or salt water oysters. A pearl 
starts out as a bit of dirt or garbage or something foreign that is annoying 
the oyster. The oyster responds by secreting a substance to encase the piece of 
dirt. It eventually grows into a round substance we call pearl. The response of 
the oyster reminds us of how our immune system cells responds to a foreign 
object in our body. Gem Gem Family Color Sample <br>

<p> <b>Plant Sources</b>. Organic source of amber, diamond and jet. Petrified 
wood is fossilized wood that has had its organic matter replaced by agate.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Amber</b>. It is the fossilized resin of ancient pine trees which 
trapped seeds, leaves, feathers and insects and over time the resin hardened 
into a soft, warm, golden gem, known as amber.</li> 
<li><b>Jet</b>. It is black, shiny fossilized coal. When trees fell into the 
swamps the water logged trunks sank and compressed. In fresh water, soft jet 
was formed. Salt water formed hard jet.</li> 
<li> <b>Diamond</b>. Made from carbon arranged in a cubic structure, hardness 
of 10. Carbon is the same element that makes coal and the graphite in pencils. 
It is the hardest known substance, four times harder than corundum. Carbon has 
other allotropes (different forms of the same chemical created by a different 
internal physical structure).<br>
<b>&raquo; Graphite</b>. A hexagonal 
structure of carbon. Iron black, dark gray, black, steel gray color, hardness 
is 1.5 to 2.<br>
<b>&raquo; Chaoite</b>. A hexagonal structure of carbon. Dark 
grey color, hardness is 1 to 2.<br>
<b>&raquo; Fullerite</b>. Black, brown 
color and 3.5 hardness.<br>
<b>&raquo; Lonsdaleite</b>. The heat and stress of 
a meteorite impact transforms the graphite into a hexagon shaped diamond, 
brownish black, light brownish yellow color and hardness is 7 to 8.</li> 
<li> <b>Petrified Wood</b>. There are three types. Silicified wood has a wood 
grain pattern. Palm wood, from palm trees, looks different depending on the 
angle of the cut. It may be spotted, or have lines. Massive silicified wood has 
so much wood replaced with silica that a wood grain pattern cannot be 
recognized.
<ul> 
<li> <b>Petrified Dinosaur Bone</b>. Quartz replaces the cellular structure in 
fossilized bone.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>The Gems Of Heaven</b>. The walls of the city of New Jerusalem and the 
breastplate of the high priest are made of twelve different gem stones. Some of 
these names are unknown, but some people have guessed which gem they might be. 
Agate is usually striped blues or earth tones. Chrysoprase is apple green 
chalcedony. The shade of green is due to nickel. Carbuncle is a red garnet. 
Carnelian is a red chalcedony.<br>
 The colors may be incorrect because some of 
these names are no longer used and because some stones have more than one color 
variety.<br>
 If the colors are correct, the walls of the city appear to have a 
green and blue foundation (or these are new colors that we do not know) then 
they progress in the order of the rainbow.</p>

<p> <b>Fossil Fuels and Hydrocarbons (Oil and Natural Gas)</b><br>
 Oil is 
called &quot;black gold&quot; because it is a mined resource that is highly 
prized. Most of our energy (81%) is produced by the three main sources of 
fossil fuels. These deposits of fuel are created from old trees and animals. 
Their existence points to their rapid burial and mass storage in fixed places 
by the catastrophic flood. But the bible also indicates that the region called 
Babylon (Iraq) had open tar pits before the flood.<br>
<br>
 Other sources of 
fossil fuels are heavy oils, tar sands, oil sands and oil shale, but they are 
more expensive to produce. The largest deposits are in Canada and in the 
Orinoco province of Venezuela.<br>
<br>
<b>Nuclear Energy</b>. This is 
renewable, but it is not suitable for vehicles and the problems of radioactive 
waste and disposal are enormous. The contamination lasts for 24,000 years.<br>

<br><b>Green Fuel</b>. These are friendly to the environment. They produce no 
known pollutants and are renewable. While other sources of energy are not 
practical for operating vehicles, or are seasonal, solar energy is clean, 
renewable, not labor intensive to produce and should be cheap. Most alternative 
fuels are designed to run mobile systems and take energy to produce. Only solar 
energy and electrical battery technology (stored energy) can run green power 
plants efficiently now.<br>
<b>Thoughts to Consider</b>. How friendly is some 
of this &quot;green&quot; fuel?<br>
If we rely heavily on geothermal and ocean 
thermal energy will we cool down or heat up the oceans and affect the 
thermohaline cycle, weather patterns and the marine ecosystem?<br>
How does 
growing and burning biomass deplete the soil, pollute the air and drive up the 
cost of basic foods as farms compete to grow crops that give a higher profit?
<br><br>
 Biofuels and Alternative Fuels used for automobiles are mostly made 
from high cellulose perennial grasses and plant material like switchgrass, 
miscanthus, HDSR megaflora tree, algae, rice and corn. They will produce 
pollutants because they are carbon based. Ethanol and vegetable oil are some of 
the most popular fuels used. They are useful for removing waste, but not as a 
permanent solution for mobile fuel.<br>
<b>&raquo; Megaflora Tree (HDSR)</b>. 
This is also called HDSR because of its high density and short rotation. It is 
a broad leaf tree that grows very big, very quickly. This tree grows to the 
full size of 60 feet (1829 cm) in 3 years and regrows from the stump after 
harvest. There is no need to plant again. It grows in poor soil and harsh 
climate and helps to reclaim damaged soil. So it is a very excellent source of 
biomass for fuel which does not compete with food crops.<br>
<br>
 The United 
States consumes 25% of the global oil supply. Yet it produces only 2% of the 
oil and is only 2% of the global population. The world will run out of this 
source of energy by the middle of the century.<br>
<br>
<b>Green Fuels</b>. 
These are renewable, friendly to the environment and do not produce pollution.
<br> <b>Greenhouse Gases</b>. Gases that trap heat. Water vapor, carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and fluorocarbons<br>
<b>Photovoltaic 
Cell</b>. A photovoltaic cell makes electricity from light, mostly red light 
dislodging electrons from silicon.<br>
<b>Solar Thermal Mirrors</b>. Curved 
mirrors concentrate the rays of the sun and heat a tube of liquid which creates 
steam and moves turbines to produce electricity.<br>

Problems</b>. There are several problems with these new forms of energy. The 
ultimate system depends on a good battery design and powerful, efficient 
solar-electric vehicles. Power suppliers must also convert to solar, wind and 
steam energy.
<ul> 
<li><b>Mobile Systems</b>. The biggest problem is finding a good source of 
energy for mobile systems and a system to distribute them. Current engine 
designs are built for fossil fuels supplied by gas stations. Electric cars get 
their supply from fossil fuel power plants.</li> 
<li><b>Transitional Systems</b>. Transitional automobile systems must process 
biofuel mixtures and solar/battery power. Generators must also switch to solar 
and biofuel energy instead of fossil fuels.</li> 
<li><b>Darkness</b>. Energy can be generated at night by all systems except 
solar. Solar and wind energy can be stored in the form of chemical energy or 
heat and regenerated at night as steam.</li> 
<li><b>Inefficient</b>. Biofuels are inefficient to produce, using more energy 
than they generate. If they are produced by cheap solar or wind energy then the 
trade off will be worth it.</li> 
<li><b>Not Green</b>. Ethanol, Biofuels and biowaste also contribute to green 
house gases such as carbon dioxide, so they are not long term solutions but 
they can make us independent of oil. However, instead of burying the waste in 
land fills or the ocean, using them as energy could be a better way to dispose 
of them.</li> 
<li><b>Not Clean</b>. There is no such thing as &quot;clean coal&quot; or 
&quot;clean nuclear&quot;. They are more expensive and dangerous to create and 
the toxic waste must be disposed of and managed forever.<br>
Coal produces 
green house gases and the &quot;clean&quot; technology proposes burying the gas 
underground instead of in the air. This could create a future problem that we 
have not evaluated. No one knows what happens to this gas. Coal also produces 
soot and coal ash which is buried in landfills or kept in ponds. This ash has 
toxic heavy metals lead, mercury and arsenic which contaminate ground water.<br>
Nuclear produces radioactive waste that lasts thousands of years.</li> </ul>

 Ideally, the best 
solution is a combination of solar and battery technology. Practically, unless 
businesses can engineer a constant flow of income from these systems, they will 
not develop them. Unless they can build in planned obsolescence or keep the 
service station model they will not support a system that will one day give the 
owner total independence from the energy producers. Therefore, they will invest 
in biofuels but not solar. Biofuels use a lot of energy in their production. 
Some estimate that they use more energy than they produce!. The best way to 
make this work is to use solar energy for processing. Manufacturers also remove 
the expensive bran and germ before fermenting the starch.<br>
<br>
<b>What if?
</b>  Since oil, coal and diamonds are carbon products created under pressure, 
is it possible that the oil fields have diamonds? And does the presence of 
diamonds indicate oil near by? <br>
<b>Energy Development</b>. The key to our 
future energy needs is the development of reliable solar energy. Therefore, one 
major problem to resolve is the development of small batteries that can store 
large amounts of energy for long periods of time or long distances and can be 
recharged in minutes.<br>
 One other possible breakthrough is the development 
if solar panels that can be shaped and colored so that they are pleasing to the 
eye and blend in with existing roofing material.<br>

 Our 
world has many different worlds or biomes. There are oceans, deserts, rain 
forests, snow and ice, bodies of fresh water and the salt water ocean. Many 
different types of plants and animals were created to live in these different 
places. What makes them different is the temperature and the amount of water, 
sunlight and nutrients. With warm average temperatures and lots of water more 
life can be supported. With light, photosynthesis and plant growth occurs, 
attracting more life. The biomes exist in three zones.
<ul> 
<li><b>Terrestrial (Land or Epigean)</b>. Above ground. </li> 
<li><b>Subterranean (Hypogean)</b>. Underground systems including caves and 
aquifers.</li> 
<li><b>Aquatic (Water)</b>. Fresh water and marine (sea). The open ocean zones 
are based on many criteria, resulting in many names for the same region.
<ul> 
<li><b>Light</b>. Division is based on amount of sunlight that penetrates: 
Epipelagic, mesopelagic, Bathypelagic. This affects photosynthesis and the 
ability of plants to grow.</li>

<p> <b>Trees and Flowers</b><br>
</p> <b>Botany</b>  The study of plants. <br>

<br> People need trees to provide the air we breathe, clothes, the food we eat 
and to build houses. Their flowers give us beauty and fruit, and they provide 
shade from the sun.<br>
<br>
 In the day light trees breathe in (inhale) carbon 
dioxide and breathe out (exhale) oxygen. The process is reversed at night. 
Animals only breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. So plants and people 
need each other to provide good air.<br>
<br>
 People can make Vitamin D from 
the sun, but we cannot use it to provide the amount of food we need. But plants 
do this for us. Plants take energy from the sun, water and minerals from the 
earth to make fruits, seeds and nuts.<br>
<br>
 Fruits and flowers are food to 
animals but they are the reproductive system of plants. It is the flowers that 
eventually produce fruits and seeds. These seeds grow into new plants. The 
parts of a plant are:
<ul> 
<li><b>Root</b>. The root is a part of the digestive system of the plant. It 
drinks water and minerals that the plant needs to make food.</li> 
<li><b>Trunk and branches</b>. They are like the skeleton of a plant. They 
support the tree and contain tubes through which water travels from the root to 
the leaves.</li> 
<li><b>Leaf</b>. Plants use the leaf to make food from the sunlight, to 
breathe and to evaporate water. So, a leaf functions as the digestive, 
respiratory and urinary system of a plant.</li> 
<li><b>Flower</b>. A flower is the reproductive system of the plant. In most 
plants they contain both the male and female parts.</li> 
<li><b>Seed</b>. A seed is the egg of the plant. It is produced from the 
flower.</li> 
<li><b>Fruit</b>. A fruit is like the baby of a plant. It is produced only 
when the female flower is fertilized. It contains the baby and the food that 
the baby needs to grow. A seed does not eat the fruit, but it uses the fruit to 
attract animals. When the animals take the fruit, they take the seeds and 
scatter them so that a new plant can grow in another place.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> God created some very interesting plants. </p> Weird Plants <br>
The 
Walking Banyan Tree <br>
 The largest banyan tree has 1775 trunks. <br>
 The 
Thomas Edison Museum in Florida has the third largest banyan tree which is over 
400 feet wide. (122 meters) <br>
<br>
<b>A forest of one tree</b>. The banyan 
tree is a fig tree that grows in Southeast Asia and India. It has multiple 
branches that grow down into the ground so that they appear to look like 
another tree. Therefore it is called the walking Banyan tree.<br>
 As the 
branch grows, it send down shoots that eventually reach the ground. They become 
so big that they look like a tree trunk. So the tree spreads by creating these 
new trunks from its branches. <br>
 Corpse Plant  It has a giant flower 6 to 9 
feet tall found in Sumatra. The flower blooms every 1 to 3 years and dies after 
just 2 days. It smells like rotting garbage, rotten eggs or a dead animal from 
up to half a mile away. <br>
 Male and female tree  Most trees have flowers 
that contain separate male and the female parts in close proximity. These trees 
can reproduce by themselves. But dioecious trees grow as a separate male and 
female tree. The ginkgo and date palm are examples of these trees. <br>

Carnivorous plants  Some plants like the venus flytrap and the pitcher plant 
eat meat! They lure insects to their death with pretty colors and a sweel 
smell. The venus flytrap has leaves that are shaped like a jaw and they snap 
shut when an insect walks in.<br>
<br>
 The pitcher plant has a lid that can be 
closed when it traps an insect. mmmm soup! <br>
Male trees give more pollen.

<p> <b> Farming (Organic)</b><br>
 This is the science of managing crops 
without using artificial seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Adam was the first 
organic farmer. God gave him the task of caring for the animals and the garden 
and to farm the land.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Soil Preparation</b>. 
<ul> 
<li><b>Test Soil</b>. Find missing nutrients, pH and soil type (loam, silt, 
sandy or clay).</li> 
<li><b>Remove Weeds</b>. Rake, water and remove the weeds every week for four 
weeks.<br>
<b>Soil Solarization</b>. This is a method to kill harmful fungi, 
bacteria, nematodes, weeds, and certain insects. It works in warm climates and 
with small gardens. Cover the moist soil with transparent plastic film and 
allow the sun to heat the soil for four to eight weeks.</li> 
<li><b>Loosen Soil</b>. Aerates. Easier for the roots to go through. </li> 
<li><b>Soil Amendments</b>. Add missing ingredients to improve composition and 
texture.<br>
<b>&raquo; pH</b>: Plants need a neutral pH. Most fruit 6.5 best 
(5.5-7.2). Blueberries (4.8-5.2)</li> 
<li><b>Organic Compost</b>. Fertilizer. Add in the fall. It must be totally 
decomposed or it will take nitrogen from the soil to continue the process.<br>
 
Commercial organic fertilizer can contain decomposed animals.</li> 
<li><b>Worms</b>. If they do not come naturally, then add them. </li> 
<li><b>Plant Legumes First Year</b>. Fixes nitrogen to the soil. </li> 
<li><b>Mulch</b>. Keeps moisture in. </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Fertilizer (&quot;Plant Food&quot;)</b>. A method of applying plant 
nutrients to the soil.

</li> 
<li><b>Vermicomposting</b>. Make compost by using red earthworms to break down 
garbage. Worms also leave other particles &quot;castings&quot; that add 
nutrients. But it does not create temperatures that are high enough to kill 
pathogens. Use for food, paper and yard waste. It takes six months to break 
down organic materials if they are not shredded.</li> 
<li><b>Aerobic Composting</b>. Addition of dead plant material, seaweed, 
coffee grounds and filters, vegetable food scraps, manure, news paper, saw 
dust, moisture in a pile to heat and rot in the sunshine. Piles should be no 
bigger than 3x3x3 feet (90x90x90 cm). Turn every two weeks to add air to the 
inner layers. It takes from three to four weeks to two years to decompose 
depending on how much work you do in shredding the materials and aerating it. 
Temperatue should be between 104-131&ordm;F. Add more grass clippings and green 
vegetation to increase the rate.<br>
<b>&raquo; Carbon</b>: Dried leaves, 
straw, hay, sawdust, or shredded paper.<br>
<b>&raquo; Nitrogen</b>: Grass 
clippings, hay, legumes, manure, ammonium nitrate (urea).<br>

<b>&raquo; Sulphur</b>: Acid rain, gypsum <br>
<b>&raquo; 
Calcium and Magnesium</b>: Dolomitic limestone, gypsum <br>
<b>&raquo; Potassium
</b>: Wood ash, greensand, granite meal <br>
<b>&raquo; pH</b>: Alkaline (raise 
ph) (lime, wood ash). Acid (lowers pH): sulfur, pine needles, peat moss.</li> 
<li><b>Green Manure (Cover Plant)</b>. A legume that is planted then put pack 
into the soil to rot. Adds nutrients and prevents erosion.</li> 
<li><b>Manure</b>. Waste from animals. Use organically fed, grass fed, free 
range vegetarian animals. Modern animal feed is made from dead animals and is 
fed to vegetarian animals.<br>
<b>Rendering</b>. The process of using dead 
animals, pets, discarded meat, road kill, manure, sawdust and garbage to make 
feed for animals.</li> 
<li><b>Mulch</b>. A blanket of materials that keep mositure from evaporating. 
</li> 
<li><b>Fallow</b>. Do not grow anything on the soil. Decaying plants, rocks 
and soil will add nutrients.</li> 
<li><b>Chemical Fertilizer (NKP)</b>. They provide the top three nutrients: 
Nitrogen, Potassium (Potash) and Phosphorous. But it should not be used in an 
organic garden.</li> 
<li><b>Bone Meal and Blood Meal</b>. Ground up animal parts. <br>
 The fine 
dust may contain prions which cause CFJ (mad cow disease).</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Pest Control</b>. 
<ul> 
<li><b>Herbal</b>. Garlic and hot pepper spray teas. Organic cornmeal kills 
fungus.</li> 
<li><b>Natural Predators</b>. Lady bugs kill aphids. </li> 
<li><b>Crop Rotation</b>. Disrupts the natural cycle of pests that feed on 
specific plant families.</li> 
<li><b>Diatomaceous Earth</b>. Finely crushed fossils of freshwater and sea 
animals that look like broken glass. They cut the outer shell of insects. It 
contains silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide,iron oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium 
oxide. And trace amounts of copper, strontium, titanium, manganese, sodium, 
vanadium, boron and zirconium.<br>
 It affects ants, aphids, bollworm, salt 
marsh caterpillar, cockroach, cornworm, earwig, house fly, fruit fly, lead 
perforator, leaf hopper, lygus bug, mite, pink boll weevil, red spider mite, 
slugs, snail, termites, Japanese beetle (grub stage) and many other insects.<br>
 Breathing fine dust particles is not good for humans.</li> 
<li><b>Fence</b>. Keeps large animals away. </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Irrigation</b>. Method of watering the plants. Water in the early 
morning.
<ul> 
<li><b>Rainfall</b>. A soaking rain every 10-14 days, otherwise must be done 
artificially.</li> 
<li><b>Drip (Trickle)</b>. Water is delivered at the root drop by drop. </li> 
<li><b>Sprinkler (Overhead)</b>. Sprays or sprinklers. </li> 
<li><b>Flood</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Subirrigation</b>. Watering from below. Hydroponics grow plants in 
nutrient rich water.</li> 
<li><b>Other</b>. Center Pivot and Lateral Move. </li> 
<li><b>Aquifer Mist</b>. Adam had an automatic sprinkler system. Every morning 
a mist would come from the ground water aquifer to water the earth.</li> </ul> 
</li> 
<li><b>Crop Rotation</b>. Changing the crops grown in a field in a planned 
sequence that takes advantage of the nutrients used or created by each crop and 
the effect of each crop on the soil.</li> 
<li><b>Planting</b>. Plant twice as deep as the seed is wide. </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Crop Rotation</b>. <br>
 This does not mean that the entire field should 
be planted with only one crop every year. The field can be divided into 
different sections that grow a variety of crops, but each section must be 
rotated every year. Legumes make nitrates, cereals use nitrates so they should 
be rotated in sequence. Rotate crops by the type of family, nutrient use and 
depth of root system (deep or shallow).<br>

promote leaf growth instead of fruit.<br>
The first flowers are usually male. 
Pollination must occur for the female flower to produce fruit. So a fruit farm 
requires bees or butterflies. <br>
<b>Plant Families</b>: Legumes (beans), 
cereal, grain, pumpkin, tomato, tarot (root), cruciferous (leafy).<br>
<b>

<b>
Green Peppers</b>. They are immature peppers of the colorful varieties. <br>
<b>
Scallion (Green Onion)</b>. Immature onions. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Microgreens</b>. 
Plants can be grown in soil and harvested in small trays indoors near well 
lighted windows in 7 to 14 days. Microgreens are the stems, seed leaf and first 
set of true leaves of the seed.<br>
<b>Biblical Farming Principles</b>. These 
principles are based on the Plan of Salvation.
<ul> 
<li><b>Fallow (Land Sabbaths)</b>. Every seven years, the land must lie fallow 
for one year (no planting done). In year fifty the land must also have rest. So 
Sabbath years are year 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 50.</li> 
<li><b>Mixed Gardens</b>. A field must only be planted with one crop. </li>

Day 4 <br>

(Wednesday)  God created space on the second day and filled it with the planets 
in our solar system on the fourth day. The Bible says &quot;He made the stars 
also&quot;. This could mean that He made the stars that same day, or it is 
simply saying that He made the stars that we can see from our earth. I believe 
that He made them on that day. Because He is so incredibly awesome! <br>
<b>Sun 
and Moon</b>  God filled the fourth day with the creation of the first day. 
Since nucleosynthesis by burning hygrogen ends with nickel, God needed another 
source of light and He created the sun. The sun burns hydrogen and helium in 
the same process of nucleosynthesis to produce light. <br>

 There were nine planets in our solar system. Now there are eight 
&quot;classical planets&quot;. Scientists redefined the word planet after 
recent discoveries of other large Kuiper belt objects such as 2003 UB313, which 
has a diameter of 2600 km, making it larger than Pluto.
<blockquote> A planet is an object that orbits a star and has enough gravity 
to maintain a spherical shape. It must not be a star or the satellite of 
another planet and it must dominate its vicinity.</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p> Planets in our solar system are divided into these groups: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Terrestrial (&quot;Rocky&quot;)</b>. Those like the earth are small, 
dense and rocky with a solid surface.</li> 
<li> <b>Jovian Planets (&quot;Gas Giant&quot;)</b>. Those like Jupiter which 
are large, made of gases or fluid, lighter and colder with no solid surface. 
They all have rings.<br>
<b>&quot;Ice Giants&quot;</b>. They have less Hydrogen 
and Helium and more rock and ice.</li> 
<li> <b>Dwarf Planet</b>. Smaller planets. e.g. Ceres, Pluto, Charon, Xena. 
<br> <b>&quot;Ice Dwarfs&quot;</b>. Objects, like Pluto, whose composition is 
primarily ice.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Exoplanets</b>. Planets found outside our solar system. </p> 
<p> <b>Moon (Natural Satellites)</b><br>
 Many of these planets have other 
natural satellites or objects (moons) that orbit them. Some of these smaller 
moons have only been discovered since 2002.<br>
Our Moon is 384,403 Km (238,857 
miles) from the Earth. It has a diameter of 3476.2 km and weighs 7.347673 x 1022
 kg. It takes 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes to go around the earth.<br>
Only 
Triton and Titan have an atmosphere.<br>

<p> They used to be called Nebulae because of their cloudy appearance. 
Galaxies are huge collections of solar systems circulating in one of three 
definable shapes. They have a central nucleus and rotate like a solar system.
<br> The three known shapes are: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Spiral</b>. (Barred spiral) </li> 
<li> <b>Elliptical</b>. </li> 
<li> <b>Irregular</b>. Have no specific form because they are either single 
galaxies with a unique shape or colliding galaxies.<br>
<br>
<b>The Milky Way
</b> galaxy is 100,000 light years in diameter and interacts with two 
neighboring galaxies - the large and small Megellanic Clouds. The constellation 
Sagittarius is at the center of the Galaxy. Our solar system is located two 
thirds of the way out from the center of the Milky Way galaxy and our sun takes 
200 million years to complete one pass around the center.<br>
<b>The Crab Nebula
</b> is a supernova remnant which was first observed in 1054 A.D. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Sun</b><br>
 The sun is the closest star to the earth. It is a giant 
ball of hydrogen and helium gas that is expected to burn another five billion 
years and end its life by becoming a red giant when it loses its hydrogen. It 
will expand in size to engulf Mercury and Venus and possibly the earth. The 
earth will get hotter. Then it will become a white dwarf. This process might 
take only a few minutes! Then the earth will get darker. After it cools it 
becomes a black dwarf.</p>

 The nuclear reactions in a star give 
off radiation that causes it to shine. Eventually, this fuel will burn out and 
the star will die.<br>
 The rate at which a star dies, the violence with which 
it dies, and its final form depends on the mass of the star.
<ul> 
<li> Low mass stars like the sun live longer (hundreds of billions of years), 
die quietly and become white dwarfs.</li> 
<li> Medium mass explode and form a neutron star. </li> 
<li> High mass stars live a few million years, die in massive supernova 
explosion and form a black hole.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Eclipse</b><br>
 Eclipses occur when the light from the sun or the moon 
is blocked by the shadow of the moon or the earth.<br>
 A solar eclipse occurs 
when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun and the moon casts its 
shadow on the earth.<br>
 A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth casts its 
shadow on the moon.</p> 
<p> <b>Space Debris</b><br>
 Many small objects wander around the universe, 
sometimes in a long orbit and other times by gravitational pull. Periodically, 
these objects from space interact with the earth.<br>
There are three types - 
comets, meteors and asteroids.<br>
<br>
<b>Asteroid</b><br>
 Asteroids are 
large, solid pieces of rocks greater than 50 meters wide that may be hundreds 
of miles long. They are little planets that mostly originate in the asteroid 
belt between Mars and Jupiter. Objects less than 50 meters wide are called 
meteoroids. One classification of asteroids is the distance at which they orbit 
(Orbital radius). This classification helps to see which asteroids might impact 
the earth.<br>
<br>
<b>Modern Asteroids</b>. In modern times several asteroids 
and fireballs have struck the earth.<br>
<b>Tunguska Event</b>. On July 30 
1908, a massive explosion of an asteroid above the forests of Russia destroyed 
1000 square miles.<br>
 In 1947 another struck Siberia. <br>
 On August 10, 
1972 a large fireball appeared over Canada and the Eastern United States.<br>
 
In 1992 a fireball was observed over Florida.<br>
 In 2001, one appeared over 
Washington D.C.<br>
 On July 8, 2004, a 100 Lb meteor came over the south 
central USA (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri)</p> 
<p> <b>Ancient Asteroids</b>. Asteroids have been blamed for the destruction 
of the dinosaurs. This is partly correct. During the flood, the earth was 
struck with something with such force that it broke up the surface and tilted 
the orbit 23.5 degrees. Ever since that time, we have had different seasons, 
the land mass was separated and the oceans dominated the surface.</p> Asteroid

<p> <b>Near Earth Objects </b><br>
 Asteroid can be classified by their 
average orbital diameters. This is reported in astronomical units (AU). This is 
the distance from the Earth to the Sun. But only three of these groups are near 
Earth asteroids (NEA) that actually cross the path of the earth.<br>
 As of 
April 2004, there are 708 of these that are over one km wide. Objects that 
large can destroy the earth. As of November 2006 there were 831 potentially 
hazardous asteroids (PHA) discovered.</p>

<p> <b>Comets</b><br>
 Comets orbit the sun. There are over 100 known comets 
but there may be thousands more. Comets are dirty snow balls with a bright head 
and a long tail. They were called &quot;broom stars&quot; by early observers 
because of their shape. They are called &quot;dirty snow balls&quot; because 
they are believed to be made of ice and dirt. The tail is formed when the ice 
melts and a separate tail can be formed from the trail of dust and water.<br>
 
This trail of dust causes a meteor shower when the dust eventually reaches the 
atmosphere.</p> 
<p> <b>Meteors</b><br>
 Meteors are the temporary bright streaks of light that 
sometimes appear in the night sky at an altitude of about 100 Km. They are 
small particles that are normally the size of a grain of sand. They enter the 
atmosphere at speeds of up to 70 Km/second. A large number of these occurring 
at the same time are called a shower. The most famous are the Leonid Meteor 
showers which show increased activity every 33 years. The famous showers on the 
night of November 12-13, 1833 started interest in astronomy and led many people 
to believe that the world was ending.<br>
<br>
<b>Meteor Showers</b>. Meteor 
shower activity can be linked to the passage of comets. They are caused by the 
dust trails from the tails as they burn off. This appears as a shower several 
years later. Sometimes the trail of dust can take up to six years to become a 
shower.</p>  Meteor Shower Active  Rate <br>

<br> Meteor showers are named after the constellations from which they 
originate.<br>
The Geminids are the only showers known to be caused by an 
asteroid.<br>
<br>
<b>Fireball</b>. This is an asteroid or meteorite that burns 
up as it enters the earth's atmosphere. Meteorites are nickel and iron alloys 
that are difficult to make on earth. So scientist assume the presence of a 
meteor whenever they see this alloy.

<p> <b>Other Events and Structures</b><br>
 Some of these are predicted to 
exist, while others are descriptions of what is observed.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Supernova</b>. The death explosion of a massive star (Supergiant). It 
initially increases in brightness then gradually fades.</li> 
<li><b>Red Giant</b>. The expansion of a star as it dies when the temperature 
near the core rises causing the size of the star to expand as the core shrinks. 
It eventually forms a white dwarf.</li> 
<li><b>White Dwarf</b>. A low mass star that has exhausted most or all of its 
nuclear fuel and has collapsed to a very small size that is 1% of its original 
size but has almost the same mass as the original sun. It becomes a black dwarf 
when it cools.</li> 
<li><b>Brown Dwarf</b>. A star whose mass is too low to have nuclear fusion. 
</li> 
<li><b>Black Hole</b>. An object whose gravity is so strong that not even 
light can escape from it. It is formed from the death of a massive star.</li> 
<li><b>Dark Matter</b>. The amount of mass whose existence is deduced but 
which has not been detected.</li> 
<li><b>Neutron Star</b>. The imploded core of a massive star produced by a 
supernova explosion.</li> 
<li><b>Pulsar</b>. A rotating neutron star which generates regular pulses of 
radiation.</li> 
<li><b>The Kuiper Belt</b>. The Kuiper belt is an icy asteroid belt beyond 
Neptune. It is an area of the solar system between 30 and 50 AU from the sun.
</li> 
<li><b>&Otilde;pik-Oort Cloud</b>. An area outside the solar system that is 
believed to exist at 50,000 to 100,000 AU from the sun. It is believed to be 
the source of most comets.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Constellation</b><br>
</p> Ursa Major Constellation <br>
<br>
<br>
 A 
constellation is a major pattern of the stars in the sky which is made by 
connecting a line between the bright objects in the sky. There are 88 
constellations. They are generally confined to either the Northern or Southern 
Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
<b>The Ecliptic :</b> A band across the sky between the 
highest and lowest point of the Sun's apparent path around the galaxy.<br>
<br>

<b>The Zodiac :</b> The twelve constellations called the zodiac appear about 
eight degrees north and south of the ecliptic. Because of the Earth's motion 
around the Sun, the Sun appears to pass in front of each constellation of the 
zodiac once per year.<br>
<br>
<b>Asterisms :</b> Smaller star patterns within 
a constellation:
<ul> 
<li> Pleiades. They are also known as the seven sisters. </li> 
<li> Keystone. This is located in the Hercules constellation. </li> 
<li> Big dipper. It is part of Ursa Major. </li> 
<li> Little dipper. It is part of Ursa Minor. </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> <b>Journey through your imagination</b>  Imagine your trip through 
heaven at the Second Coming. What would you like to see? Do you think we will 
have a series of meteor showers like fireworks all the way home?<br>
 After the 
earth is recreated, we will not have a sun or moon. What do you think will be 
in space?<br>
It is possible that there will be a sun and moon but that we 
cannot see them because the light from God is so much brighter. <br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Imagine</b>  Have you ever thought about how infinite the universe is? Not 
just in terms of the size of space but in the number of possibilities. 
Everything that we can see, hear, touch and measure is based on one underlying 
concept, the electromagnetic spectrum. Suppose there are other building blocks, 
not based on electromagnetic waves?<br>
 That is your limitation. We are 
handicapped by our current knowledge and what we think is possible. How can you 
possibly think outside the box when everything in your set of building blocks 
depends on electromagnetic waves.<br>
 God has many objects in His tool box, 
look what He created with just one tool! <br>

 There are 61 constellations 
visible in the northern hemisphere, 48 were known by the ancient Greeks. In 150 
A.D., the Greek scientist Ptolemy listed 1022 stars arranged into 48 
constellations in a book named &quot;Almagest&quot;.<br>
<b>Argo Navis (Ship of 
Jason and the Argonauts)</b>. Carina, Puppis, Pyxis and Vela were part of one 
constellation. Volans and Columba are also associated with the ship.<br>

&hearts; These were known by the ancients. But Coma Berenices was a part of Leo 
and Columba was a part of Canis Major.<br>
 These and some of the southern 
constellations were named after 1600 A.D. <br>
 Did you know that God used the 
constellations and the seasons to illustrate the timetable of the Plan of 
Salvation? <br>
<br>
 The Keystone formation is in the Hercules constellation.

</p> <b>Creation<br>
Day 5 <br>
(Thursday)</b>  
On the fifth day God filled the ocean and the skies with living things. He 
created fish and birds and everything that flies. <br>
<b>Fish and Birds</b> 
The creatures of the fifth day fill the creation of the second day. Fish and 
birds were made to fill the sea and sky and both are filled with color. <br>

<br>
 Viruses and bacteria are the smallest of 
living things. But they are the source of many infectious diseases.<br>
 In an 
epidemic, pandemic or an active season for a germ, the government issues a 
report on the geographic activity of the germ concerning human to human 
transmission.<br>
 Over 40 trillion bacteria live in the human body! <br>
 An 
epidemic is a regional spread of disease. <br>
 A pandemic is a widespread or 
global spread of disease. The worst case is a level 3 or 4 pathogen, level 6 
activity and level 5 severity. Pandemic Mortality Severity Index <br>
# Severity
Example <br>
1 Widespread, low infection rate, low mortality, no economic impact
1968 flu <br>
2 Widespread, low infection rate, minimal mortality and economic 
disruptions AIDS <br>
3 Spreads quickly, low mortality (2%) 1918 flu <br>
4 
Spreads quickly, medium mortality (40%) 1347-1350 <br>
Black death <br>
5 
Spreads quickly, high infection rate, high mortality (90%) Smallpox in New World
<br> <br>
 The pandemic severity index measures disease, deaths, disruptions 
(economic impact). <br>
 A pathogen is an organism that causes disease. <br>
<b>
Microbiologist</b>. Studies microbes. <br>
<b>Virologist</b>. Studies viruses. 
<br> <b>Pathologist</b>. Examines tissues for diseases <br>

Magnifies small objects <br>
 Did you know that God used the concept of 
quarantine to illustrate the Plan of Salvation. <br>
In 1865 Dr. Joseph Lister 
used the biblical principles and introduced handwashing and sterile techniques 
to the medical community. Death rates dropped from 40% to 3% <br>
<br>
<b>
Biology</b>  The study of living creatures. <br>
<br>

<p> Living things are fascinating. A living thing grows and reproduces. Living 
things also protect themselves, we will see how they do this and the clever way 
they search for food.<br>
<br>
<b>Germs and Microscopic Organisms</b><br>
 They 
are the smallest living creatures that cause diseases.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Bacteria</b>. A single cell organism. e.g. Meningitis, tetanus. </li> 
<li> <b>Fungus</b>. A simple plant that cannot manufacture its own food, so 
they get food from living or dead tissues. e.g. Athlete's foot.</li> 
<li> <b>Protozoa</b>. A single cell organism that loves moisture. e.g. Malaria 
</li> 
<li> <b>Virus</b>. A strand of RNA or DNA that has no cell wall that is 
technically not a living organism. e.g. Influenza, measles, chicken pox.</li> 
<li> <b>Prion</b>. e.g. Mad Cow Disease. A prion is not a living organism. It 
is smaller than a virus. It appears to be a protein that causes disease and is 
spread like the four classic germs. But it survives all the medical procedures 
used to decontaminate germs.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>  Some antibiotics work by damaging the cell wall. Since viruses do not 
have a cell wall antibiotics have no effect on them.<br>
<br>
<b>Genes, 
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</b><br>
 Genetic material or genes are made up of 
two strands of material called DNA. Every cell in the body, except the red 
blood cells, has a copy of the DNA in the nucleus. DNA, inherited from the 
mother, is also found in the mitochondria. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 
one strand of DNA is inherited from each parentand the last pair determine 
gender. DNA is made up of a sugar and phosphate backbone with one of four 
chemicals attached (adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine). Adenine pairs with 
Thymine with two hydrogen bonds. Thymine and cytosine are paired with three 
hydrogen bonds. Three base pairs of genes make about twenty amino acids and a 
chain of amino acids make proteins.<br>
<br>
<b>Inheritance</b>. Any physical 
traits that we have are governed by a pair of genes. We inherit one gene from 
each parent. Simple inheritance of a trait is represented as a combination of 
two similar letters, one from each parent. However one trait may be more likely 
to be expressed than another. </p> List of Human Chromosomes <br>

<li><b>Dominant Gene</b>. It takes only one inherited gene to be expressed. A 
dominant gene is not necessarily the trait that is the most common feature in a 
population. It is represented by a capital letter in a pair of genes. e.g. PP, 
Pp, pP</li> 
<li><b>Recessive Gene</b>. The trait must be inherited from both parents to be 
expressed. It is represented by a lower case letter in a pair of genes. e.g. 
pp, Pp, pP</li> </ul>

<p> <b>Chromosome Classification</b>. Chromosomes are numbered 1 to 22 from 
longest to shortest. They are also arranged in seven groups based on size and 
centromere location.<br>
<b>Centromere</b>. Each strand of a chromosome pair is 
joined or constricted at one location creating two arms. The short arm is 
called &quot;p&quot; and the longer &quot;q arm&quot;.<br>
<b>Satellite</b>. A 
small segment separated by a secondary constriction.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Median (Metacentric)</b>. In the middle of the chromosome with two 
equal arms.</li> 
<li><b>Submedian (Submetacentric)</b>. Between the middle and one end creating 
two unequal arms.</li> 
<li><b>Acrocentric</b>. Centromere close to one end. </li> 
<li><b>Telocentric</b>. At one end. </li> </ul> Chromosome Classification <br>

<p> <b>Mutation</b>. An unrepaired error in DNA is a mutation. Genetic 
disorders or mutations occur when there are missing, excess or malfunctioning 
genes. These result in a change in the manufacture of a protein.<br>
 Anomalies 
occur when only one of the pair is inherited (monosomy) or three copies are 
inherited (trisomy) or substitutions or deletions in the chromasome occurs.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Chromosome Deletion</b>. A piece of the chromosome is missing. </li> 
<li><b>Inversion</b>. The center of the DNA breaks off, rotates and is 
reinserted upside down.</li> 
<li><b>Translocations</b>. Chromosomes switch places on different genes. </li> 
<li><b>Monosomy</b>. Only one copy is present. </li> 
<li><b>Uniparental Disomy</b>. Both copies come from one parent. </li> 
<li><b>Trisomy</b>. An extra chromosome. e.g. Down's syndrome is trisomy of 
chromosome 21</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>  The number of chromosomes is not related to the similarity, size, 
complexity or intelligence of the organism.</p> 
<p> <b>Forensic DNA Analysis</b>. DNA is used to uniquely identify a person or 
to determine genetic relationships. There are several DNA tests.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)</b>. The first nuclear 
DNA test. A restriction enzyme cuts the DNA into specific fragments which are

<p> <b>Cells And Cloning</b><br>
 DNA is found in two places in the cell. In 
the nuclear DNA of the nucleus and the mitochondrial DNA in the mitochondria 
outside in the cell body. Regular cells have all the genetic material, but the 
reproductive cells contain one half. When the egg combines with the sperm, each 
contributes one half of the nuclear genetic material. Then mitosis (cell 
division) occurs after this reproductive cell has all the DNA. So, the child 
has half the nuclear DNA from the mother and father and 100% of the 
mitochondrial DNA of the mother.</p> Female Egg Male Sperm <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 Baby Embryo <br>
 Cloning 
removes the material from the nucleus of the embryo of one animal and places it 
in the egg of another animal. <br>
 Recombinant DNA technology involves 
switching sections of the gene of an animal with the genes of another animal or 
plant. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Cloning is not the creation of life. It is the 
artificial stimulation of mitosis after recombining the nucleus of one animal 
into the cell body of the female egg. So the clone has the mitochondrial DNA of 
the female (e.g. cow) with 100% of the nuclear DNA of the other animal (e.g. 
pig).<br>
 So far cloning does not take half the genes from the nucleus of one 
animal and combine it with half of the nuclear DNA of another species of 
animal. The cloning technique takes a normal cell which has all the genetic 
material and substitutes the nuclear DNA of one animal with the nuclear DNA of 
another, then cell division is artificially stimulated.<br>
<b>Transgenic 
Animals</b>. A transgenic animal has foreign genes inserted into its DNA. 
Cloning is just one extreme form of creating transgenic animals. There are two 
basic ways of injecting or substituting new genes.
<ol> 
<li><b>Embryonic Stem Cell</b>. This is the DNA taken from a cell after the 
egg and sperm have fused.<br>
<b>&raquo; Pronucleus Method</b>. This also uses 
embryonic stem cells. After fertilization, it intercepts and substitutes the 
nucleus of the sperm before it joins the nucleus of the egg.</li> 
<li><b>Other Cells</b>. These use cells from other parts of the body, not 
embryos.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Survival</b><br>
 To survive, animals need to do several things: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Breathe </li> 
<li> Eat </li> 
<li> Reproduce. Have children to continue the species. </li> 
<li> Protect themselves from enemies. </li> 
<li> Know God. This gives eternal life. The others give temporary life. </li> 
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> Animals use two basic mechanisms to accomplish these: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Display</b>. A show of bright colors can be used to warn of danger or 
to attract a female.</li> 
<li> <b>Trick</b>. Animals use disguises and camouflage to blend into the 
surroundings so that they can hide from their enemies or to lure food.</li> 
</ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> <b>Creation</b>. Did you know that over 4000 years ago Jacob 
described a process that models the DNA double helix and the DNA replication 
process?<br>
<b>The Spotted And Striped Stick (Genesis 30: 37-41)</b>. He took 
a stick and carved spots and stripes in it, then set it in a trough of water 
where the animals of a single color came to drink and mate. When they looked at 
the stick as they mated their children looked like the stick with spots and 
stripes and circular stripe pattern (ringstraked).<br>
<b>The Spotted And 
Striped DNA</b>. The DNA double helix looks like a stick with spots and 
stripes. It even has an -OH molecule at each end. Since it carries the genetic 
desription of our outer appearance, when our parents mate we will look like the 
instructions carved in the DNA.<br>
Another &quot;silly and unscientific&quot; 
Bible story described DNA process 4000 years before Watson and Crick discovered 
it. <br>
<br>

<p> <b>Camouflage</b><br>
 Camouflage is the art of blending into the 
surroundings so that you cannot be seen. It is based on the fact that the eye 
tends to look for patterns and to fill in the gaps.<br>
 The four methods used 
to blend into the surrounding environment are:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b> Similarity</b>. Use the same pattern, color, shape or size. <br>
 The 
pink flower mantis looks like the orchid that it hides inside as it waits for 
food.<br>
 Leaf bugs look like leaves. <br>
 Most camouflage mimic only one 
pattern but Cuttlefish are the best. They mimic color, pattern, texture and 
shape of any environment and can even give a light show by changing color in 
rhythmic pattern like a neon sign.</li> 
<li> <b> Proximity</b>. Align yourself in the same direction as the 
surroundings.<br>
 Stick bugs look like a branch. They attach themselves to the 
tree at an angle like a branch.<br>
 Some sea horses align themselves upright 
to look like the seaweed.</li> 
<li> <b> Continuity</b>. Use the same pattern as the surroundings. Or use the 
same pattern to appear larger so that no individual stands out.<br>
 The 
striped pattern of the zebra makes it impossible to see only one.</li> 
<li> <b> Closure</b>. The eye will fill in missing details. Therefore, the 
object being hidden does not have to look exactly like the surroundings.</li>

<p> <b>Insects</b><br>
 85% of all living creatures on earth are insects from 
over one million species. Insects have six legs, hard outer shell (exoskeleton) 
and a three part segmented body (head, thorax and abdomen). Arachnids have 
eight legs and two body parts. They include spiders, scorpions and mites in 
about 73,000 species.<br>
<b>Honey Bee</b> <br>
</p> <br>
 Bees are social 
creatures that live in hives ruled by a queen. There are three different kinds 
of bees in a hive who divide the work by them: <b>Queen</b>. The only bee who 
can have children. A queen develops when the larvae is fed royal jelly. <br>
<b>
Worker Bee</b>. Females who do not have children. They build the hive, gather 
nectar, water and pollen and care for the colony. They make the honey, feed the 
queen and the babies, clean the hive and defend the colony. <br>
<b>Drone</b>. 
Male bees who fertilize the queen <br>

<b>Zoologist</b>. Studies

<b>Ornithologist</b>. Studies birds <br>
<br>
 When they find a 
source of food, worker bees, perform one of two different kinds of dances when 
they return to the hive.
<ol> 
<li> <b>Circular dance</b>. Tells the location of food sources less than about 
one hundred yards away. (91 meters)</li> 
<li> <b>Figure eight dance</b>. Tells the location of food sources over one 
hundred yards and up to several miles away.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Communication</b>. Some bees use pheromones, sound and dance to 
communicate. The bees have two dances to indicate the location of food. A 
circle dance indicates food without any reference to distance. When the food is 
far away (over 300 feet) the bees do a &quot;figure eight&quot; dance. In the 
dance, they waggle their bodies to tell the distance and direction of the food 
in relation to the sun. As the sun changes its location, the information in the 
dance must change. This indicates intelligence and mathematical ability.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Angle of the dance</b>. They use the sun as a compass in relation to 
the vertical wall of the hive to show the angle of the food in relation to the 
sun.
<ul> 
<li><b>Upward</b>. The food is in the direction of the sun. </li> 
<li><b>Downward</b>. The direction opposite the sun. </li> 
<li><b>Other angles</b>. The direction away from the sun. </li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Length of the dance</b>. The distance from the hive. </li> 
<li><b>Number of &quot;waggles&quot;</b>. The distance from the hive. </li> 
<li><b>&quot;Vigor&quot; of the dance</b>. How delicious the food is. </li> 
<li><b>Scent</b>. Gives an idea of the source of the food. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> Other experiments show that if the information seems to be impossible, 
then the hive will not go after the food.</p> 
<p> <b>Ants</b><br>
 Ants also live in social colonies like bees but with 
millions of members, with the same division of work structure by three types of 
ants.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Males</b>. The males have one pair of wings and do not work. Each 
spring, the queen lays eggs that develop into winged males and winged fertile 
females. The kings and queens swarm out of the colony and mate in the air. Then 
the males die. They live about eight weeks while the queens live ten to thirty 
years. <b>Queen</b>. Winged female ants. The only ant who can have children <br>
<b>Workers</b>. Sterile, wingless females. They collect the food, feed the nest 
and larvae, build and clean the nest. <br>
<b>Soldiers</b>. Large sterile 
females who defend the colony, raid other colonies and capture slaves <br>
<b>
Drone</b>. Winged male ants who fertilize the queen and die <br>
<b>Myrmecology
</b>. The study of ants. <br>
 Go to the ant, you lazy bum. Consider her ways, 
and be wise&quot; Proverbs 6: 6 <br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Queen</b>. Once the queen mates in flight with several males she loses 
her two pairs of wings and goes to start a new colony. After mating she 
searches for a place to dig the founding nest which is a vertical tunnel 2 to 5 
inches deep (5-13 cm). She seals herself off in the nest to lay eggs and to 
rear the first brood of workers. After this her only work is to lay eggs. When 
she mates she collects and saves a bag of sperm that lasts her whole life. She 
uses this sperm to control the gender and type of ant (male, female or queen). 
She lays thousands of eggs, some are fertilized, some are not.
<ul> 
<li><b>Male</b>. The unfertilized eggs will hatch into males. </li> 
<li><b>Sterile Female Workers</b>. The fertilized eggs will hatch into females 
but the sex organs are underdeveloped. The genes of the father determines the 
size of the worker ant.</li> 
<li><b>Fertile Queen</b>. When the larva of a fertilized egg is fed enough 
food, hormone levels increase and cause sex organ development.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Workers</b>. Sterile females who become regular workers or the larger 
soldiers. Work is distributed by the size and age of the ant. Workers feed and 
groom the queen and larvae, build tunnels, and protect the colony.<br>
&raquo; 
<b>Minims</b>. Tiny worker ants who are too small to do any work but they 
hitchhike on the back of the loads and help to warn against airborne attacks.
<br>&raquo; <b>Younger Workers</b>. They take care of the larvae, pupae and the 
queen.<br>
&raquo; <b>Middle Aged</b>. They take care of the nest, repair, dig 
tunnels, store seed and transport food. Later they transport waste and guard 
the nest.<br>
&raquo; <b>Old Ants</b>. The most dangerous job. They leave the 
nest and forage for food.<br>
&raquo; <b>Soldiers</b>. They grow larger, have 
big heads and jaws to defend the colony.<br>
&raquo; <b>Farmers</b>. Among the 
different ant species are many types of behaviors performed by these workers. 
Many ants are farmers who raise plants and animals.
<ul> 
<li><b>Aphids (&quot;Ant Cows&quot;)</b>. Several species of ant domesticate a 
kind of insect called an aphid. These aphids usually suck more juice out of a 
plant than they need and it is secreted out of their backs. The ants milk this 
delicious nectar. In return the ant protects the aphids from predators and even 
care for their young. Other insects also make this precious honeydew and the 
ants also keep these to farm. e.g. scale insects and the larvae of the 
corbicular butterfly.</li> 
<li><b>Mushroom Farmers</b>. Leaf cutter ants cut leaves to make mulch which 
they take underground and fertilize with their feces. Then they grow a fungus 
in this compost heap and even weed the garden to remove unwanted plants.</li> 
<li><b>Tree Farms</b>. Other species of ants collect and grow tiny seeds and 
plant them underground or above ground. They gather tiny seeds from the fields 
and plant them underground. When the seeds sprout, they bite off the green 
sprouts and dry the seeds in the sun. The seeds are stored in underground 
chambers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

Honey Pot Ants  During the rainy season, storage ants fill 
their abdomens to the size of grapes with nectar and hang from the ceiling 
until there is famine. When the food gets low the colony gets nectar from them. 
They sometimes capture hostages from other colonies and raid a colony to kill 
the queen and enslave the workers. <br>
Leaf Cutter Ants They are gardeners who 
gather leaves, grind them to smaller pieces, fertilize them with their feces 
and then grow a fungus which they use for food. When the queen goes to create a 
new colony she carries a sample of this fungus with her. <br>
Harvester Ants  
They collect, store, and eat seeds. Sometimes they travel up to forty miles 
away from their nest in search of food. <br>
Army Ants Migratory hunters that 
feed on other creatures. They travel up to 20 meters per hour and set up a 
temporary camp every night and only stay in one location for 2 to 3 weeks when 
it is time to lay eggs. The queen lays at least 30,000 eggs in one day. They 
can interlock their legs to form bridges across rivers and roll up into a ball 
to float in a flood. <br>
Polyergus Samurai  Ants of the Polyergus samurai 
species have sharp, sickle-shaped mandibles which are good for fighting but 
useless for domestic work.. They do no work except to raid other nests and 
force the slaves to work. Between July to September the worker ants raid the 
nests of formica japonica species and seize the larvae and pupae of the raided 
nest. When they grow to adults they become slaves. <br>
<br>

<p><b>Communication</b>. Ants hear with their knees by picking up vibrations. 
Ants touch their antennae to communicate, rock back and forth so that their 
mandibles strike the nest with beats up to seven thumps per 50 millisecond 
(drumming), by making high pitched squeaks by rubbing body parts (stridulation) 
or use pheromones. Pheromones are chemicals that are used to alert other ants 
of danger, mark trails, identify each other, enlist the help of other ants and 
scare off enemies.<br>
 Ants are the most numerous types of creatures. They 
have a combined weight greater than the combined weight of all humans.<br>
 
Ants can carry 10 to 20 times their body weight and they work in teams to move 
heavy objects.<br>
 The largest ant colony is 3,600 miles long (5890 Km), 
stretching from the Italian Riviera to northwest Spain. It consists of billions 
of Argentine ants living in millions of nests that cooperate with each other.
</p> 
<p> <b>Birds</b><br>
 There are about seven to eight thousand species of 
birds. Fish and birds were created on the same day and are the most colorful of 
the living creatures that God created.<br>
<br>
<b>Mccaw or Parrot</b>. These 
birds are interesting because of their beautiful colors and because they can 
imitate human speech. They mate for life and are often seen in pairs.<br>
<b>
Humming Bird Facts</b>. They are the smallest birds. Wings flap at 100 beats 
per second and they can fly backwards.<br>
<b>Indigo Bunting</b>. The male bird 
has a beautiful indigo blue color, while the female is brown. They migrate 
south and travel in flocks at night, navigating by the stars.<br>
<b>Bird Song
</b>. Birds sing, and the sound is similar to speech in humans. </p> 
<p> <b>Fish</b><br>
 God created some very incredible fish and other creatures 
that live in the sea. Let us take a look.<br>
<br>
</p> Creature Description 
Fish Farms <br>
Anableps He has an interesting eye. The top half can see in the 
air and the bottom half sees in the water.  Modern technology allows us to grow 
fish on farms. But the living conditions are not what our Creator intended for 
His creatures and the results are probably not healthy.
<ul> 
<li> Farmed fish are crowded into pens and swim in their own waste. It is like 
living in a toilet.</li> 
<li> The waste from a normal farm is equal to the sewage from a city of 7,500 
people - this contaminates the water and destroys other fish habitats.</li> 
<li> Toxins are ten times higher in PCBs. </li> 
<li> Diseases spread faster because of crowded conditions and the sewage water 
they live in. Therefore farmed fish receive antibiotics in their food and by 
injections. But disease still spreads to the wild fish and the excessive use of 
antibiotics creates super bugs that we have no methods of killing.</li> 
<li> Since their normal color is grey, farmed fish are dyed pink so that they 
look like wild fish.</li> 
<li> Farmers kill hundreds of seals and sea lions and other fish to protect 
the farmed fish.</li> 
<li> Three pounds of mackerel, sardines and other fish feed one pound of 
salmon. 2,332,000 tons of fish are taken from the sea to produce 737,000 tons 
of salmon in 1997.</li> </ul> Source: <br>
Archer fish Captures insects by 
shooting water out of the air like a bullet. <br>
Angler fish He goes fishing! 
In front of his mouth hangs an appendage that attracts other fish. Also, the 
male does not eat. He attaches himself to a female and their blood streams 
merge! Now how could these have evolved? Not! <br>
Decoy fish He also goes 
fishing by attracting other fishes. One of the fins looks like a tiny fish 
while the rest of the body is camouflaged. <br>

<b>Imagine </b>  Try to invent a new animal. What 
colors will it have? Will it be spotted or striped? Imagine a patchwork animal!
<br> Will it fly, hop, swim or do all of these? Where does it live? Does it 
only like to eat blue things? Can it talk like a parrot?<br>
Give it a name. 
God asked Adam to name the animals. Maybe He will make this animal just for you 
and you will see it in heaven. <br>

<p></p> 
<p> <b>Animals And Man - The Incredible Human Body</b><br>
</p> <b>Creation 
<br>Day 6 <br>
(Friday)</b>  On the sixth day God created the male and female 
animals on the land. In the evening he created the last two living things. He 
created Adam and Eve. <br>
<b>Animals and Man</b> Magnetic elements are in the 
sixth period. God created marriage to complete the attraction between male and 
female. <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p> </p> <br>
<br>
<b>Male and Female<br>
Impossibility </b>  Sexual 
reproduction could not have developed over millions of years because the male 
and female must develop simultaneously in the same location in less than fifty 
years for humans and in a week for fruit flies.<br>
<br>
This impossible 
coincidence must be repeated in every species. Millions of them. <br>
<br>
<b>
Adam and Eve</b><br>
 The first two humans were Adam and Eve. They are the 
parents of all the human family. Therefore they must have had the genes that 
are in all the different racial groups. What do you think they looked like?<br>

 Humans and all biological systems reproduce in two ways:
<ol> 
<li> <b>Asexual Reproduction</b>. This is usually done only by simple single 
celled creatures. The cell usually eats and grows in size then it divides to 
form two new creatures from the old one.<br>
 This apparently does not work 
well with complex creatures. I tried doubling in size so that I could split in 
two and reproduce. I only got fatter.</li> 
<li> <b>Sexual Reproduction</b>. Requires two creatures, a male and female. 
This is a problem for evolutionists. Usually, they will throw in millions of 
years for events to happen. Unfortunately, the reproductive system is very 
complex and the two creatures have totally different parts, and half the 
genetic material they need. In addition, they only have a short period in their 
life span for these systems to develop<b>and</b> the compatible design must be 
transmitted to the other parent who<b>must</b> be developing at the same time. 
<br>Evolution cannot support separate species communicating design 
specifications to each other therefore it is a mystery how the two different 
creatures emerge within thirty years with chemical and physical attributes that 
complemented each other.<br>
Because evolution depends on an offspring 
surviving they needed an answer to the question of reproduction. To answer this 
question they developed a theory called<b>Monster Mutation</b>. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> <br>
<br>
<b>Scientific Observation </b>  The difference in size of a 
liger and a tigon shows that in one generation a medium sized animal can 
produce a giant and a dwarf. So, could a dinosaur sized creature and a lizard 
be produced in the same year from a large alligator? This is observable 
evidence that the evolutionary charts that rely on differences in size as proof 
of long periods of growth are a fallacy. <br>

<p> <b>Hybrid Animals</b><br>
 God created us so that we cannot have children 
with other species. But humans have tried to cross-breed related species. But 
even animals that are closely related have a few problems. Hybrid breeds are 
almost always sterile.<br>
<br>
<b>Mule</b>. The child of a female horse and a 
male donkey.<br>
<b>Hinny</b>. The child of a male horse and a female donkey. 
<br><b>Tigon</b>. The child of a female lion and a male tiger that is usually a 
dwarf that is much smaller than the parents.<br>
<b>Liger</b>. The child of a 
male lion and a female tiger that is usually a giant. It is the largest cat in 
the world. It has stripes and spots and an orange - gold color. They can stand 
up to twelve feet tall and weigh as much as 1000 pounds. (3.7 meters and 454 
kg).<br>
<b>The Lion and the Lamb</b>. Scientists claim that carnivorous 
animals must eat meat to survive. They claim that this is why they have evolved 
sharp incisor teeth. But &quot;Little Tyke&quot; is a female vegetarian lion 
who refused to eat meat. She ate cooked grain, raw eggs and milk. The bible 
says that the lion will live with the lamb and it will eat straw like an ox.</p>
<p> <b>Evolution: Monster Mutation.</b> </p> <br>
 Even if a fish could 
possibly give birth to a frog. It is impossible for a male and female to emerge.
<br>That would require two impossible events using processes that contradict 
modern observations and scientific knowledge. <br>
<br>
 This is the fairy tale 
that says that one day a fish laid one egg and a male and female frog came out! 
This is contrary to what we observe and know about genetics.
<ol> 
<li>Current biological observations show that a single egg can only produce 
identical babies of the same gender.</li> 
<li>A creature can only produce their own species. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> The theory recognizes that small mutations will not create the large 
biological changes that cause evolution. This is because small mutations 
usually go back to their original form within two generations. The famous gypsy 
moth experiments failed because the moths would change back after two 
generations. Biological systems also have many complicated parts that must all 
be working at the same time or they will be useless.<br>
 Therefore, the theory 
says that once every 50,000 years an egg has so many huge mutations that it 
cannot go back to an original form.<br>
Therefore, a fish can give birth to a 
frog!<br>
However, realizing that they have to account for sexual reproduction, 
they further went on to say that when the new creature emerged, a male and 
female must emerge from the single egg.<br>
That does not sound like a 
scientific theory. It is a fairy tale!<br>
 And this miraculous fairy tale 
continues further because every one of the two to thirteen million species that 
we know, must have gone through this same miraculous process that is full of 
coincidences.<br>
Imagine, thirteen million impossible events. In fact, twenty 
six million impossible events if you count the male and female.<br>
<br>
<b>
Monster Mutation Mathematics.</b> Apparently, evolutionists cannot do basic 
arithmetic either because if a new creature emerged every 50,000 years then it 
would take 75 billion years to develop the one and a half million species that 
we have named so far. And 650 billion years to develop the thirteen million 
estimated species.<br>
 What is wrong with these figures? The big bang that 
started evolution was calculated to have occurred 6 to 13 billion years ago and 
life emerged 545 million years ago!<br>
<br>
 Instead, for the time in which 
life is supposed to have emerged, the calculations support one specie emerging 
every 540 years for the 1&frac12; million we know exist. And, forty two years 
for the thirteen million we estimate to exist.<br>
 Some people claim that 
there are 100 million species, thirteen million is just the conservative upper 
limit. If there are 100 million then they must have evolved every 5&frac12; 
years.<br>
 I have not seen any of these exotic new creatures, have you? My toe 
nail does not grow that fast.</p> 
<p> <b>The Human Body</b><br>
 God says that we are &quot;wonderfully 
made&quot;. He made several advanced systems to take care of our bodies while 
we are on earth. These systems manage the body like any major city government. 
There is a defence or military system, transportation, communications, 
education, medical, reproduction, energy, structural engineering, waste 
management and food management.<br>

He appears as one who is on fire from head to toe. There is a stream of living 
water flowing from Him. This combination of water and light causes a rainbow 
and a cloud to surround Him. His structure can change and pass through solid 
physical objects. He can move faster than light. He does not eat or sleep. His 
breath gives life to physical beings. He reproduces by speaking electromagnetic 
waves. How awesome is our God! <br>

<b>Designer</b>  The epiglottis is a flap of cartilage that 
covers the trachea when we swallow and stops food from entering the lungs. If 
evolution occurred, then our ancestors would have choked on their food for 
several thousand years until they realized that they should evolve a flap to 
protect the wind pipe. It sounds ridiculous. A baby would have choked to death.

 Study any system in the body and you will realize that it would not 
function if it had to wait millions of years for the necessary part to evolve.

<p> <b>The Respiratory System</b><br>
</p> # Organs Structure Function <br>
 1 
 Lungs The right side has three lobes and the left has two. They have a thin 
lining, the size of a tennis court, which absorbs oxygen and transfers it to 
the hemoglobin of the blood. High levels of carbon dioxide make the blood more 
acidic. This triggers the vagus nerve which causes us to increase respiration 
and exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide <br>
 2  Heart Receives oxygen from the 
lungs and sends carbon dioxide to the lungs through the pulmonary vein and 
artery <br>
 3 Diaphragm  Muscle moves up and down so that the lungs can 
contract and expand and force air in or out <br>
 4  Trachea  Wind pipe. Air 
flows from the nose to the lungs <br>
 5  Ribs  12 ribs attached to the spinal 
column in the back and the sternum in the front. They protect the organs in the 
chest <br>
 5a  7 true ribs  They are attached directly to the sternum <br>
 5b 
 3 false ribs  They are attached directly to the cartilage of the last true rib 
<br>  Right Lung  Left Lung  5c  2 floating ribs  They are only attached in the 
back <br>
 Breathing  5d  Cartilage  They attach the ribs to the sternum <br>

<b>Inhale</b>. A vacuum is created when the diaphragm and the rib cage contract 
and air rushes in. The diaphragm flattens and the ribs spread and are raised.
<br> <b>Exhale</b>. When the rib muscles and the diaphragm relaxes air is 
forced out.  6  Sternum  The true ribs are attached here in the front <br>
 7  
Spine  All the ribs are attached in the back <br>
 8  Clavicle  Collar bone <br>
 9  Pleura  Lining between the ribs and lungs that allows the lungs to slide 
along the rib cage without an injury <br>
<b>Paramedic</b>. Provides first 
emergency services. <b>Respiratory Therapist</b>. Gives breathing treatments. 
<br> <b>Asthma</b>. Breathing impairment. <b>Cystic Fibrosis</b>. Mutation 
creates thick mucus in the lungs <br>
<b>The First Surgery</b>. The Bible says 
that God made Adam fall asleep, then He took a rib and created Eve. Now men and 
women have an equal number of ribs. So, where did the ribs come from and why 
did God use the rib? Here is a possible answer.
<ul> 
<li><b>13 Pairs of Ribs</b>. Most people have twelve ribs. A few have eleven 
or thirteen. Adam could have had thirteen pairs in the beginning. If Eve was 
made from one pair of ribs, then God would use the number twelve to represent 
the number of people, who are within the body of one man, who would be the 
foundation of a race of people.</li> 
<li><b>Floating Ribs</b>. He could have used a part of the floating ribs. </li>
<li><b>Stem Cells</b>. The bone marrow has cells called stem cells. These can 
grow into any type of cell. However, the power of God is so great that he might 
have used other processes to create her.</li> </ul> <br>
 Did you know that the 
structure of the rib cage and chest cavity illustrates the Plan of Salvation? 
<br>God demonstrates how he will make peace with the world through twelve 
nations. <br>

through the pulmonary artery and to the lungs.<br>
<br>
 In the lungs, carbon 
dioxide is removed and oxygen is added.<br>

 The blood returns to the left 
atrium through the pulmonary vein and enters the left ventricle through the 
bicuspid valve. Then it is pumped through the aortic valve to the aorta and to 
the body.  3 <b>Other Blood Components</b>  Thrombocyte  (Platelet) causes

<br>
Peripheral Nervous 
System<br>
 Somatic Nervous System Voluntary Responses <b>Autonomic Nervous 
System</b>. From internal receptors to smooth muscles and glands. They affect 
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic motor system. The Sympathetic system 
activates the body with noradrenaline, causing the &quot;fight or flight&quot; 
response. The parasympathetic system uses acetylcholine to relax the body. <br>

 Autonomic Nervous System Involuntary Responses <br>
<br>
<br>
 The neurons 
transmit electrical signals between the brain, spine, muscles and sensory 
organs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The nerves are the electrical system of the body. 
Signals travel from the brain through the nerves. Chemicals at the end of the 
nerves help to block or transmit signals to the next nerve. It is these 
chemicals that are mostly affected by illegal drugs.<br>
<b>Neurotransmitters
</b>. Cross the synapse to send a signal. Some examples are, Acetylcholine, 
noradrenaline, norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine.<br>
Drugs usually act on 
the neurotransmitters by either blocking their actions or mimicking them. <br>

<br> <b>Peripheral Nervous System</b> The neurons of the brain and spine <br>
 
Sensory Neurons Send information from the outside to the central nervous 
system. They have long dendrons and short axons. Cell body and dendrites are 
outside the spinal cord <br>
 Relay Neurons These nerves carry signals between 
neurons. They have short axons and dendrons and are located in the spinal cord. 
<br>  Motor Neurons Send information from the central nervous to the muscles. 
They have short dendrons and long axons. Axon is outside the spinal cord and 
the terminals attach to the muscles. <br>

 The retina contains 100 million rods and 
seven million cones and a chemical called rhodopsin, or &quot;visual 
purple.&quot; Rhodopsin converts light into electrical impulses that are 
transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve. The cones are sensitive to red, 
blue and green. Rods handle vision in low light.<br>
Look at what a color blind 
person sees.<br>
<br>
<b>The Blind Spot</b>. It occurs where the about 1 
million axons of the nerves and blood vessels exit the eye. At that location 
there can be no rods or cones to interpret vision. &nbsp; <br>

<p> <b>Color Deficiency</b>.<br>
 Our eyes have three color receptors (red, 
blue, green). These are the primary colors of light. A person with color 
blindness (color deficiency) has difficulty seeing one or more of these colors. 
However, they may be extremely good at identifying variations in shade of the 
same color. This makes them excellent snipers and good at identifyingcamouflaged
 objects.<br>

of males and 0.4% of females in the United States. <br>
 Deuteranomaly is the 
most common form of color blindness (5% of males, 0.38% females). <br>
 
Tetrachromats have four color receptors and pentachromats have five. This 
enhanced ability to see color may only exist in birds and some insects. <br>

<p></p> 
<p> </p> <b>Imagine</b>  Do you think that we will be able to see radio waves 
or hear visible light when we go to heaven? Are there other colors? Can we 
hear, feel, smell or taste colors? It is possible if God widens the range of 
our receptors.<br>
Imagine seeing a song and composing music so that the color 
combinations and patterns it creates are as interesting as the sound. Could we 
create a song that generates heat that will keep us warm or cool? If we can use 
heat to run motors, is it possible to use sound or light as a new energy source?
<br> <b>Synesthesia</b>. This means joined perception. It is a condition in 
which some people experience another sense in addition to the primary 
sensation. They might experience a certain taste when they hear sound. Or see 
colors associated with letters. This is because the areas in the brain that 
process the senses are close to each other and have developed crossed links. So 
no two people will have the same experience. This is different from the ability 
that I describe above. <br>

<p> <b>Pregnancy Anomalies</b><br>
</p> Gender Determination  A gene on the Y 
chromosome (SRY) is the master switch for making a male. There are two ways to 
determine gender. Whether an organism is male or female. <br>
1 External Sexual 
Characteristics  The gender is male if there is a penis. <br>
2 XX or XY 
Chromosomes  The sperm and egg each have half of the genes (chromosomes) 
needed. The egg has only &quot;X&quot; chromosomes. The sperm can either have 
&quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; chromosomes.<br>
 The gender is female if the 
chromosomes are &quot;XX&quot; and male if they are &quot;XY&quot;.<br>
 In 
rare cases an egg can lose one of these chromosomes. An &quot;XO&quot; fetus is 
a female that may have begun as an &quot;XX&quot; female or &quot;XY&quot; 
male. &quot;OY&quot; fetus is probably a possibility. <br>
Variations 
Hermaphrodite  An organism with both sexes, or the external characteristics are 
partially from both genders. Earthworms and garden snails are complete 
hermaphrodites. <br>
Parthenogenesis  The ability of an unfertilized egg to 
hatch. Usually, only females are produced. But unfertilized bee eggs turn into 
males in the spring. <br>
Multiple Births Fraternal  Separate eggs fertilized 
by different sperm cells which may be of different sex <br>
Identical  One egg 
divides and each new cell becomes a separate fetus with the same sex. <br>

 Multiple births 
occur when there are more than one fertilized egg or a single egg develops into 
separate babies. Several anomalies can occur in this process.
<ul> 
<li><b>Conjoined</b>. Incomplete division of a cell causes fusion at the 
physical level with an incomplete separation of identical children after the 
twelfth day of fertilization. Each section develops into a separate fetus that 
are joined in their physical body. Joining can occur at the front, side or back 
at the head, chest, abdomen or hips.<br>
<b>&raquo; Acardius-Acephalus 
(Parasitic Twin)</b>. A poorly formed fetus that does not have a heart or a 
brain is attached to a complete baby and is completely dependant on the normal 
child. The parasite can appear as an extra leg or a complete baby. Sometimes 
these extra limbs can be attached in strange places.<br>
<b>Acardiac</b>. A 
baby whose upper body is not developed. It has no head, heart or arms. If it 
survives in the womb it is because it uses the blood supply of its twin.<br>
<b>
&raquo; Sirenomelia (Mermaid Syndrome)</b>. Fusion of the legs. This is a birth 
defect that is not related to conjoined twins.</li> </ul> Type of Join Head

<br>

<ul> 
<li><b>Superfetation</b>. Having a second pregnancy while you are already 
pregnant. This is extremely rare.</li> 
<li><b>Fetus in Fetu (Baby in a Baby)</b>. An undeveloped fetus is encased 
into the body of the other twin. One fetus is absorbed into the cell of the 
other during the early stages. So it is possible that this could occur with 
either identical or fraternal twins. It does not have any internal organs and 
does not develop into a viable baby. It is completely dependent on the normal 
baby.<br>
<b>&raquo; Teratoma (Monster Tumor)</b>. This is a tumor that may 
have hair, teeth and other tissues and may look like a cyst caused by a fetus 
in fetu. However, it is a cancer that is caused by unfertilized reproductive 
cells (egg or sperm) dividing and differentiating like a normal fertilized egg.
</li> 
<li><b>Hormone Anomalies</b>. Male or female external characteristics can 
develop because of a malfunction in the hormones or abnormal levels of the 
correct hormones during gestation.<br>
<b>&raquo; Androgen Insensitivity 
Syndrome (AIS)</b>. Genetic males with an XY chromosome who do not develop the 
male features because the male hormones (androgens) are not functioning 
normally. Testosterone is produced but the body cannot process it and actually 
turns it into estrogen. So feminization of the external sexual characteristics 
develops and the penis does not form and the testes do not descend.</li> 
<li><b>Chimera and Genetic Mosaics</b>. Fusion at the cellular level that can 
occur between eggs of the same sex or opposite sex. A person whose 
non-identical twin was merged with their cell and causes them to have two 
different DNA in various body tissues with various degrees of expression. While 
chimerism of identical twins may be impossible to prove, only chimerism of 
fraternal twins can be detected.<br>
<b>&raquo; Hermaphrodite</b>. A true 
hermaphrodite is a chimera in which both male and female genes are fully 
expressed. Most hermaphrodites are either genetic males or female whose sexual 
organs have changed because of sex hormones in the womb.<br>
<b>&raquo; 
Turner's Syndrome</b>. This disease is caused when an egg loses an 
&quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; chromasome. If a male egg loses a &quot;Y&quot; 
chromosome, he genetically becomes an &quot;XO&quot; female with one 
&quot;X&quot; chromosome. If this occurs in one of two identical twin boys, 
then we could have a case when identical twins would be male and an infertile 
female! This anomaly may occur in some or in all cells. So far it seems to 
occur only in real girls whose father has lost the &quot;X&quot; chromosome.<br>
<b>&raquo; Noonan's Syndrome</b>. This occurs in boys who have the same 
symptoms as girls with Turner's but they have no damaged chromosomes.<br>
<br>

<b>Is this a Possibility?</b> Normally, when a sperm fertilizes an egg, a 
change occurs in the lining that prevents penetration by other sperms. Is it 
possible that this system can be compromised? So chimerism could be caused by a 
variation of fetus in fetu at the cellular level in the early stages of cell 
division, or it could also be caused by a second sperm penetrating the egg. The 
second sperm could be the same or the opposite sex as the first.<br>
<b>In 
Vitro Fertilization (&quot;Test Tube Babies&quot;)</b>. Chimerism appears most 
often in cases of In vitro fertilization. Possibly cases of gender 
identification may be prevalent also. With &quot;test tube&quot; babies, many 
male and female eggs are simultaneously fertilized together in a dish which is 
a soupy mixture of male and female chemicals. In the body, these are most 
likely separated for three to ten days. If there is a multiple birth, identical 
twins would be of the same gender. Fraternal twins of opposite genders may come 
from separate ovaries and are separated for days before they are implanted in 
the uterus. Who knows how the unnatural forced chemical environment affects the 
growing fetus.<br>
Cancer is more prevalent in this group. </li> </ul>  The 
cancer process and the development of the cells into a fetus have important 
common elements. Both involve the rapid growth of cells. In addition, teratomas 
are cells that have received the instruction to differentiate like an embryo. 
While the development of the embryo eventually includes instructions to stop 
this process, cancer cells do not receive or respond to these instructions. So, 
understanding embryonic development may lead to a cure for cancer. And, 
understanding teratomas may lead to the growth of replacement body parts. <br>

<b>
Ruminant Stomach</b>  Some vegetarian animals have a stomach designed to digest 
plant material. Their stomach has four parts. During digestion, food goes from 
the mouth to the first and second stomach. Then the animal lies down and the 
food is regurgitated and is swallowed into the third stomach. Then it goes to 
the fourth stomach and to the intestines. <br>
 1  Chewing and fermentation  
Rumen  The bacteria named cellulase breaks down and ferments cellulose <br>
 2  
Reticulum  Packs undigested food into cud so that it can be regurgitated and 
chewed again. <br>
 3  Ingestion  Omasum  Water is absorbed <br>
 4  Abomasum 
<br>(True Stomach)  Prepares food for digestion in the small intestine. It 
releases hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes <br>
 Did you know that God 
usedthe ruminant stomach to illustrate the resurrection which is a critical 
part of the Plan of Salvation? The stomach of the clean animal demonstrates the 
death burial and resurrection of the Seed of God who would spring back to life 
after it fell into the earth and died. <br>
 Cows eat as much as 90 pounds (41 
kg) of food each day. This produces methane gas in their stomach. They can 
expel as much as 600 liters (132 gallons) of gas each day (from both ends). 
This includes up to 455 liters (100 gallons) of burps. But cows that eat grass 
instead of feed mixtures produce less methane. Since methane is a greenhouse 
gas, cows contribute to global warming. <br>

<b>Designer</b>  The fact that male and female exist is the 
greatest proof that God exists. It is impossible for one complicated human 
being to evolve, but it is even more impossible for a male and a female to have 
evolved because they would have to evolve within 30 years and a short distance 
from each other.<br>
 And this miracle of both male and female evolving must be 
repeated at least 26 million times (twice for each of the 13 million species we 
have named on earth). But there are probably over 100 million species. <br>

<br>
<b>What Do You Think?</b>  Animals, people and plants 
were about 200%-300% larger in the beginning and lived ten times longer. Only 
since advancement in modern technology, nutrition and medicine have we seen a 
small increase in age and size since the middle ages (3 inches or 8 cm).<br>
 
We can link the decrease in age to a change in diet from vegetarian to 
carniverous. What could have caused the great reduction in size? Change in diet 
and waste products. Pollution. Exposure to radiation. Decrease in the speed of 
light. Genetic changes and genetic pollution. <br>

<br> <b>Caring For God</b><br>
 You can care for God by remembering how great 
He is. He created the world in six days He loves you. To care for Him you can 
do the following:
<ul> 
<li> Challenge the theory of evolution by learning as much as you can. </li> 
<li> Pray to Him every day. Talk about your day. He needs good news. Find out 
about His day. He probably had to comfort a lot of people.</li> 
<li> Let God be your hero. Not a movie star or an athlete. Have they ever 
dunked a star three billion miles away? Can they make a frog with blue dots or 
speak to a butterfly?</li> 
<li> Tell others about Him. </li> 
<li> Obey Him. He knows what is good for your mind and body. </li> 
<li> Praise Him for His mighty acts. Thank Him for the ozone, for trees, for 
the indigo bunting. Smoking Damages the Lung <br>
Normal Lung Smoker's Lung 
Emphysema <br>
<br>
The lung is pink with little black spots caused by inhaling 
carbon from pollution. This lung is black with deposits of carbon and tar. The 
white spots are cancer. Parts of the lung cannot expand or contract. It is 
difficult to breathe. <br>
<b>Difficult Breathing</b>. Take a deep breath and 
hold it.<br>
Take two more deep breaths without exhaling. <br>
The last two 
breaths are what it is like to breathe with emphysema. <br>

<li> Be confident in His moral teachings. Loving and caring is more than 
agreeing with your friends. It is agreeing with God. You show His love best by 
being kind to everyone. You show your love to Him by obeying Him, no matter 
what your friends say.</li> 
<li> Appreciate our wonderful bodies and respect ourselves and others. </li> 
<li> He has set aside time for you to meet Him every Saturday Sabbath. This is

<p> <b>Caring For Your Mind And Body</b><br>
 Many people abuse dangerous 
legal substances, prescription drugs and illegal drugs because of the good 
feeling that they get for ten minutes. Unfortunately, these are addictive, 
destroy the mind and the body and your future.<br>
 Although some drugs give a 
good feeling in the beginning, they quickly become addictive and it takes more 
of the drug to give the same high, until finally there is no more pleasure and 
you need to take the drugs to avoid the pain of withdrawal. <br>
<br>
Alcohol 
and Cigarettes. Legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes are often the 
first substances used and become the gate through which the other drugs are 
abused. Here are some facts about smoking.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>90% of the tar that is inhaled stays in the lungs. </li> 
<li>90% of emphysema cases are caused by smoking. The lungs are unable to 
exhale because there is no more elasticity.</li> 
<li>Smoking causes cancer of the lung, tongue, lip, mouth, throat, esophagus, 
larynx, pharynx, pancreas and bladder.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Organized Crime. In addition, the people who profit from the sales of these 
drugs are also responsible for the cycle of evil in murder, crime, slavery, 
terrorism and misery.<br>
Appetite Suppressants. I also notice that many drugs 
created as appetite suppressants commonly become these narcotic drugs or are 
banned because they cause permanent damage. The class of drugs designed as 
appetite suppressants have proven to be dangerous almost every time. They have 
destroyed the brain, liver and the heart tissue. Do not let the drug companies 
experiment on you.<br>
Club Drug. These are drugs that are popular at bars, all 
night parties and dances. MDMA (Ecstasy), GHB, Rohypnol, ketamine, 
methamphetamine, and LSD.<br>

 The trend towards a low carbohydrate and 
high protein meat diet is not biblical.<br>
While we believe that refined flour 
and sugars are to be avoided, God designed our original diet to be high in 
carbohydrates from fresh fruits, vegetables and grain. All protein was from 
beans, grains and nuts. Meat was not eaten for almost 2000 years. After meat 
was introduced into the diet, the average age dropped from 700 years to 70 
years! <br>

 Our wonderful bodies 
need regular maintenance to grow. We need energy which is stored in food. We 
need fresh air, water, rest, regular exercise and sunshine. The food pyramid is 
a guide that tells us what to eat.
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Energy</b>. We need carbohydrates to give our bodies energy. <br>
<br>

<b>Growth and Repair</b>. Proteins are used to build muscles and repair the 
body.<br>
<br>
<b>Fiber</b>. We need fibre to help to clean the digestive 
tract. We get this from fruits, beans and vegetables.<br>
<br>
<b>Rest</b>. We 
need rest to restore our mental functions and to allow the body time to repair 
itself.<br>
<br>
<b>Sunshine and Fresh Air</b>. Sunshine is good for creating 
Vitamin D in our bodies and for killing germs. It is also good for our mental 
health. Plants convert the energy from sunshine into food. Avoid the sun 
between the peak hours of 10:00 A.M. and 4:00 PM.<br>
<br>
<b>Exercise</b>. We 
need at least sixty minutes of exercise every day to prevent weight gain.<br>

<br> <b>Moderation (Temperance)</b>. Temperance is knowing how much to consume. 
Too much or too little can be deadly. Too much direct sunlight can damage the 
skin. Overeating can lead to obesity. Even too much water can cause water 
toxicity or leach minerals from the body.<br>
<br>
<b>Worship</b>. We need to 
know God. Jesus said,&quot;Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word 
that proceeds from the mouth of God.&quot; (Matthew 4: 4) </p> 
<p> <b>Food Groups</b><br>
 These are the food groups: </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Water (6 - 8 glasses). </li> 
<li> Fruits (2 - 4) servings or 2 cups. </li> 
<li> Vegetables (3-5 servings) or 2&frac12; cups. </li> 
<li> Carbohydrates (Grain, bread, cereal, rice and pasta) 6-11 servings or 6 
oz. Use unprocessed, whole grain.</li> 
<li> Protein (Milk, cheese and Yogurt) 2-3 servings or 3 cups. <br>
(Beans, 
nuts, eggs, and meat) 2-3 servings or 5&frac12; oz.</li> 
<li> Fats and oils. Eat as little as possible. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Chemical Reactions</b>. Vitamins and minerals are needed by the body to 
perform important chemical reactions that will process the carbohydrates, 
proteins and fats. These are found in fresh fruits and vegetables. Vitamins A, 
D, E and K are fat soluable and the rest are water soluable. Sunshine can also 
make Vitamin D through our skin.</p> Mineral Atom Function Vegetarian Source

<p> Play a Nutrition Game. Analyze your diet here.<br>
<br>
<b>Dietary Style
</b><br>
 People have different rules by which they prepare meals. </p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Fruitarian</b>. Eats only fruit. Did you know that in God's original 
plan humans only ate fruits, grains, nuts, herbs and vegetables? The animals 
ate the herbs or vegetables. Nobody ate meat.</li> 
<li><b>Vegetarian</b>. Does no eat meat (this includes fish and chicken). 
There are two types of vegetarians.
<ul> 
<li> <b>Vegan</b>. Does not eat any products that come from an animal, this 
includes eggs and milk and any products made from them (cheese and yogurt).</li>
<li> <b>Ovo-lacto Vegetarian</b>. Eats eggs and milk products. </li> </ul> 
</li> 
<li><b>Kosher</b>. A vegetarian diet is always kosher. A non-vegetarian does 
not eat unclean meats such as pork, duck, shrimp and crab.<br>
Kosher rules do 
not allow the mixing of meat and milk or cheese in the same meal.<br>
Kosher 
rules are maintained by Jews and Christians who believe that the dietary laws 
of the Bible are still in effect, and some meats are clean while others are 
unclean and unfit for food.</li> 
<li><b>Non Vegetarian</b>. Eats any meat. In the past decade, a distinction 
had been made between white meat (fish and chicken) and red meat (beef).
<ul> 
<li><b>Carnivore</b>. Eats meat. </li> 
<li><b>Omnivore</b>. Eats anything. </li> 
<li><b>Teenagers</b>. Eat junk foods. Junk foods have little nutritional value 
and lots of fat and sugar. Fat and sugar have been linked to many diseases.</li>
</ul> </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Water</b>.<br>
 Our bodies are 75% water and our brain is 85% water. So 
we need to drink about 6 to 8 glasses per day. The rule is one quart of water 
(four glasses) for every 50 pounds of body weight. (One liter for every 22.68 
kg). Water is best stored in glass containers. Plastic or metal might cause 
chemicals to contaminate the water.</p> Water Source Processing Additives <br>

<b>Dehydration</b>. Lack of water <b>Water Toxicity</b>
. Too much water <br>
<br>
<br>
 There are many types of water. The definition 
depends on the source, original content, purification and the additives.
<ul> 
<li><b>Source</b>. <br>
<b>&raquo; Surface Water</b>. Contaminated water, 
rivers, lakes and ponds.<br>
<b>&raquo; Aquifer</b>. Water from an underground 
source of water. The quality depends on its proximity to dirt, rocks and sand.
<br> <b>Artesian Well</b>. Aquifer is standing much higher than the rock 
gravel, or sand. The aquifer may also be in a contained space so that it does 
not mix with other pools of water.<br>
<b>Artificial Well</b>. An underground 
source that comes to the surface because of an artificial hole in the ground.
<br> <b>Spring</b>. An underground source that comes to the surface naturally. 
</li> 
<li><b>Supplier</b>. <br>
<b>&raquo; Municipal</b>. Government purified, 
disinfected and delivered by pipes to the public. It is tested every day.<br>

<b>&raquo; Bottled</b>. The source of bottled water may be a city municipal 
supply or natural source. It may not be disinfected or purified. Usually, the 
source is approved and it is periodically tested around four times a year.</li> 
<li><b>Additives</b>. Carbon dioxide, chlorine, fluoride, sugar, vitamins, 
fruit and inorganic minerals. You can only absorb 8-12% of the inorganic 
minerals if you are below 35 years old and only 3-5% if you are above 35 years 
old. So water may not be a good source of minerals. Emergency Water Purification
<br> <b>Bleach</b>. To purify water in the wild, add four drops of regular 
chlorine bleach to one quart of clear water. Let it stand for thirty minutes.
<br><br>
<b>Boiling</b>. Heat clear water and let it boil for ten minutes. For 
higher elevations let it boil for one minute extra for each 1000 feet (300 
meters).<br>
<br>
<b>Iodine</b>. Twelve drops for each gallon of water. Allow 
to stand for thirty minutes. <br>
 These methods only kill some microbes and 
will not neutralize harmful chemicals. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Purification</b>. There are several methods of purification. One or 
more may be used on a particular product. In some water, minerals or carbon 
dioxide may be added back after it is purified. But depending on the type of 
water, the added ingredients must be the same amount as it naturally occurs at 
the source.
<ul> 
<li><b>Activated Carbon Block Filter</b>. Removes large particles like sands 
and rusts. This is usually the type found in homes.</li> 
<li><b>Softener</b>. Added chemical that removes pure calcium and magnesium by 
forming less active salts.</li> 
<li><b>Reverse Osmosis</b>. Removes heavy metals and some of the chemicals 
such as insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, and industrial solvents. Removes 
most radioactive minerals like strontium, plutonium, and chlorine, asbestos, 
selenium, mercury, hardened minerals, barium, nitrate, copper, lead. Biological 
germs like bacteria, viruses, and parasites are also removed.</li> 
<li><b>Deionization</b>. Removes nitrates, minerals (calcium, magnesium), and 
the heavy metals (cadmium, barium, lead, and some forms of radium).</li> 
<li><b>Distilled</b>. Heated to produce steam and condensed back into water. 
All impurities and minerals are removed.</li> 
<li><b>Sterilization</b>. Pure water heated to kill microorganisms and to 
remove chemicals.</li> </ul>  Some additives, like fluoride, may be useful. The 
consumption of too much purified water can increase the chance of tooth decay 
and leach other minerals from the body.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>Healthy Habits</b>. Stop drinking and smoking. Exercise. Walk. <br>
<br>
<b>Mental Health</b>. Do not take illegal drugs. Be kind to others. Thinking 
only about yourself does not promote good mental health. Care for others 
without any thought of a reward. A good spiritual life will help you to bond 
with others in true love.<br>
 Limit your exposure to violence and fake 
reality. Turn off the television. Go walking, hiking, read a book, do puzzles, 
construct puzzles. Learn to write with both hands. Then try to draw with both 
hands. Learn to write with your feet.<br>
<br>
<b>Spiritual Health</b>. This is 
the most important thing you should do. Pray to God, praise Him and thank Him 
every day as often as you can. From this relationship you will learn to love 
and that you are loved so much by God.</p> 
<p> <b>Nutrient or Matter Life Cycles</b>. Several important elements are 
needed to preserve life and they undergo several processes that recycle them. 
Notice that the sun plays a critical role in many processes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Water Cycle (Hydrologic Cycle)</b>. 
<ul> 
<li><b>Evaporation</b>. The sun heats up water in seas, rivers and lakes and 
turns it into steam which rises up in the air.<br>
<b>&raquo; Transpiration</b>

<li><b>Precipitation</b>. Clouds get too heavy and fall. Pure water returns to 
the earth as rain, snow, ice.<br>
<b>&raquo; Infiltration</b>. Rain sinks into 
the earth and becomes ground water.</li> 
<li><b>Collection</b>. Rain water collects in ground water, lakes, and in 
rivers which run to the sea.</li> </ul> - CO2 Sun <br>

<br> </li> 
<li><b>Carbon Cycle</b>. It is the fourth most abundant element. 18% of living 
organisms is composed of carbon, while the earth has 0.19%. Carbon exists in 
the earth as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbonate (CaCO3), coal, dead organic matter.
<ul> 
<li><b>Photosynthesis</b>. Plants use light energy to convert carbon to 
organic matter.</li>

<li><b>Nitrogen Cycle</b>. Animals get their nitrogen from plants or other 
animals. Plants only use nitrogen in the form of nitrates (NO3), ammonia (NH3) 
or urea (NH2)2CO. 
<ul> 
<li><b>Nitrogen Fixation</b>. Nitrogen can be changed by three processes: 
<ul> 
<li><b>Lightning</b>. Combines nitrogen and oxygen. </li> 
<li><b>Microbes</b>. </li> 
<li><b>Industry</b>. Produces ammonia, urea and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) for

<li><b>Decay</b>. Protein and plant material decay and produce ammonia. <br>

<b>&raquo; Ingestion</b>. Animals eat the plants and make proteins. </li> 
<li><b>Nitrification</b>. Bacteria convert ammonia to nitrites (NO2)- and 
other bacteria convert nitrites to nitrates (NO3-). These are available to the 
roots of plants.</li>

universe. Oxygen burns hydrogen in living matter to produce energy
<ul> 
<li><b>Electrolysis</b>. Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using 
electricity from solar energy. This releases oxygen into the air and stores 
hydrogen.</li> 
<li><b>Hydrogen Storage</b>. Hydrogen is stored in a battery or fuel cell. In 
the body, the storage factory is the mitochondria and the hydrogen is stored in 
a battery called Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP).</li> 
<li><b>Hydrolysis (Combustion)</b>. Oxygen is recombined with the stored 
hydrogen to produce water and electricity or other forms of energy.</li> </ul>

<p> <b>Doomsday Scenarios</b><br>
 Finally, this would not be complete without 
a scientific analysis of possible doomsday events. This list was taken from a 
two hour documentary on the History Channel called &quot;Last Days on 
Earth&quot;.</p> Source # Event Description <br>
Human Activity 1 Planetary 
Climate Shift The temperature and climate are being affected by green house 
gases causing global warming, glacier melting, rise in sea level and sea 
temperature and stronger hurricanes. Warmer temperatures also melt frozen 
methyl hydrates, releasing methane gas which is 26 times more powerful than 
carbon dioxide as a green house gas <br>
2 Plague A pandemic caused by a deadly 
pathogen like H5N1, small pox, ebola or a reengineered germ that is used as a 
biological weapon <br>
3 Atomic Weapon A nuclear bomb <br>
Earth 4 Supervolcano 
A major eruption of a supervolcano could destroy a continent and plunge us into 
a state of nuclear winter <br>
Outer Space 5 Asteroid A cosmic bus crash. A 
large one could destroy the earth. Apophis will approach earth below the height 
of our communications satellites on April 13, 2029 and 2036 <br>
6 Renegade 
Black Hole A giant cosmic vacuum cleaner. In 2000, scientists discovered that 
black holes can wander around aimlessly. A renegade black hole would suck up 
and devour our planet <br>
7 Gamma Ray Bursts Nuclear gamma radiation bursts 
occur about once per day. They are caused by the final collapse of a star. If 
one explodes close to earth it could kill all biological life in one month <br>

<br> While the Bible does say that we will be destroying the earth when Christ 
comes and that we will be terrified by events approaching from the heavens, we 
are guaranteed that there will be people here when He comes. So the earth will 
never be totally destroyed by any of the above doomsday devices.

<p> <b>Caring For The Earth</b>. </p> Conflict Diamonds <br>
 Conflict 
diamonds or blood stones get their name because of the exploitation of workers, 
families and children.
<ul> 
<li>More than half of the world's diamonds are cut and polished by child slave 
laborers.</li> 
<li>They are used to fund civil wars. </li> 
<li>Children are used as soldiers, slave workers and prostitutes. </li> 
<li>The all male work rules in the camps discourage families and encourage 
prostitution. So AIDS is rampant among the diamond mines.</li> </ul> God says 
that it is your responsibility to care. <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 You can care for 
the earth and its people by doing several things:
<ol> 
<li> Recycle. </li> 
<li> Walk, use bicycles or use public transportation. This reduces the amount 
of fossil fuels in the air.</li> 
<li> Conserve water. </li> 
<li> Do not litter. </li> 
<li> Plant gardens. </li> 
<li> Reduce the number of harmful chemicals going into the atmosphere. </li> 
<li> Take care of national parks and forests. They are our lungs. </li> 
<li> Do not buy products that hurt other people and animals. Some endangered 
animals are killed for their horns, skins and bones. Some people are enslaved 
or severely underpaid to work in diamond mines.</li> 
<li> Care for the people and creatures of the earth. <br>
We are all children 
of God. All of us were descended from Adam and Eve. Blond hair, dark hair, 
straight or curly. Black skin, brown or white. We all have the same original 
parents. Since the laws of genetics make it impossible for different species to 
have children, no human beings were descended from monkeys. Just as all colors 
can come from one set of parents, all features can come from one set of parents.

One set of brown parents can produce all colors
<br>Source: christiananswers.net/q-aig/race-skincolor.html <br>
<b>Albino</b>. 
Lack of skin color due to loss of melanin <br>
<b>Down's Syndrome</b>. Excess 
chromosome 21 changes physical appearance <br>
<br>

<blockquote> Modern genetics shows that when a large, freely interbreeding 
group is suddenly broken into many smaller groups which from then on breed only 
among themselves (as the Biblical description of the language dispersion at 
Babel would imply), different racial characteristics will arise very rapidly. 
It can be shown that one pair of middle-brown parents could produce all known 
shades of color, from very white to very black, in one generation. The racial 
characteristics which exist today have not evolved, and generally speaking, are 
simply different combinations of pre-existing (created) genetic (hereditary) 
information. The environment plays a secondary role in favoring certain 
combinations over others.</blockquote> Environment does not change our genes. 
It may cause those with certain characteristics to move to a more favorable 
environment.<br>
 Skin color is essentially the only biological difference in 
race, and science has been unable to determine all the causes of 
&quot;race&quot;. Melanin is one chemical that affects color. People with dark 
skin have more melanin and light skin have less.</li> 
<li> Care for the God who made them all. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> <b>Imagine</b>  Since we are all descended from Adam and Eve, what do 
you think they looked like? The word Adam means red dirt. Is that a clue? <br>

<br> <b>What Do You Think?</b>  If God does something different on Sabbath that 
He does not do on other days, then we may be able to detect this activity. On 
Sabbath the creation rests. God might bring a spark of energy that rejuvenates 
those at rest. It could work like a wave that synchronizes with those at rest 
(same frequency) but interferes with the waves of those at work. Resting on 
another day can never capture this scheduled burst of energy.<br>
This periodic 
boost may be part of the system of derived eternal life. <br>
