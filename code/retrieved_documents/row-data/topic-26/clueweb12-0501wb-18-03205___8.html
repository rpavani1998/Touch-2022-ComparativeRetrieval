<p>The Audi A6 has often had to give best to the BMW 5-Series in the executive 
car stakes. However, the all-new model is aiming to take the corporate car park 
by storm. Lightweight aluminium construction, efficient new engines, and agile 
chassis and luxurious cabin all combine to take the A6 to the top.</p> 
<p> </p>  &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Our Choice:</b> Audi A6 SE 2.0TDI <br>

<br> <b>Styling</b> <br>
It&rsquo;s clear that the A6 takes its cues from the 
firm&rsquo;s larger A8 luxury saloon. It is handsome and well proportioned, but 
the newcomer&rsquo;s shape is extremely colour sensitive &ndash; the 
combination of a classy metallic colour and big wheels results in the most kerb 
appeal. As before, buyers can choose between traditional four-door saloon and 
versatile estate bodystyles. At present there are only two trim levels: SE and 
S-line. The latter gets a sporty bodykit, LED lights, lowered suspension and 
18-inch alloy wheels.<br>
<br>
<b>Interior</b> <br>
As you&rsquo;d expect from 
Audi, the A6&rsquo;s cabin is first rate. Not only is it attractively styled 
and logically laid out, the fit and finish are excellent. All the plastics have 
a quality look and feel, while leather seat trim is standard on all models. 
Highlights include a pop-out screen for the standard sat-nav, beautifully 
designed dials and the firm&rsquo;s intuitive MMI media interface, which is 
available with the A8&rsquo;s clever touch pad control. And with plenty of 
adjustment for the seat and wheel, finding a comfortable driving position is 
easy.<br>
<br>
<b>Driving and performance</b> <br>
Owners of the outgoing A6 
will be amazed by the new car&rsquo;s poise and agility. There&rsquo;s lots of 
grip in the corners, particularly in four-wheel drive quattro models. And while 
there&rsquo;s not much feedback, the steering is precise and well-weighted. 
S-line versions get sharper responses thanks to lowered and stiffened 
suspension, but pay off us extremely firm ride. Performance fans can choose 
between a smooth and punchy 296bhp 3.0-litre V6 TFSI petrol, while the 
firm&rsquo;s familiar 3.0-litre TDI is available with either 201bhp or 242bhp. 
However, for most buyers the refined and frugal 175bhp 2.0-litre oil-burner 
serves-up the best blend of pace and economy.<br>
<b><br>
MPG and running costs
</b> <br>
Thanks to its weight-saving aluminium construction, the A6 is 
remarkably efficient. Go for the entry-level 2.0-litre TDI and you&rsquo;ll be 
rewarded with fuel returns of 57.6mpg and CO2 emissions of 129g/km &ndash; 
figures that easily match the excellent BMW 520d. Even the more powerful 242bhp 
3.0-litre TDI emits only 156g/km and will manage 47.9mpg at the pumps. All 
models are will equipped, while class-leading residuals make the Audi a solid 
long term investment.<br>
<br>
<b>Practicality</b> <br>
If you regularly carry 
passengers, then the A6 should be at the top of your list. Rear seat occupants 
will find more head and legroom than in a BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class, 
while the boot will swallow a healthy 530-litres of luggage. Owners wanting 
even more space can opt for the Avant load lugger, which boasts 1,680-litres of 
carrying capacity with the rear bench folded flat. Both saloon and estate 
versions benefit from cabins that are packed with useful cubby space, including 
a large glovebox, deep door bins and a decent-sized lidded compartment in the 
centre console.<br>
<br>
<b>Reliability and safety </b> <br>
With a full 
complement of six airbags, a strong bodyshell and standard fit ESP, the A6 is 
sure to earn a five-star EuroNCAP rating when it is tested. There&rsquo;s also 
the option to add hi-tech safety kit, such as lane keep assist, blind spot 
monitoring, night vision and adaptive cruise control. And buyers seeking 
further piece of mind can specify the firm&rsquo;s trademark quattro four-wheel 
drive system.<br>

<h4> Storm? What Storm? </h4> 
<p> QUOTE: &quot;Audi's executive saloon ... is set to take the market by 
storm.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm sure it will, amongst the miniscule % of the 
population this car is relevant to.<br>
<br>
Ho hum, the rest of us get on with 
life ....</p>

<h4> Phoned-In styling, phoned-in review? </h4> 
<p> Ingolstadt calling - we'd like you to review our new car. It will say...

<h4> So dull. Unbearably dull. </h4> 
<p> Terrible. </p>

<h4> Da Silva's Alfa </h4> 
<p> Audi once was Ferdinand's Audi. I was fan of Audi at those times when 
managed by Ferdinand Piech. Though the car was not advanced as BMW and 
Mercedes, it was elegantly striking at those times. It was Audi. Unique Audi on 
its own. Not similar to any other car. Now Audi became similar to what Alfa 
Romeo could be if Da Silva were at Alfa. Losing its original genes, and trying 
chasing BMW, Audi is not on the way it should be. Claimed to be better than a 
BMW is not at all convincing. May be closer than ever before to BMW, but I do 
not think equal.</p>

<h4> Perfect Car! Italian Design and German Engineering! </h4> 
<p> I really think Audi now offer better design and quality than BMW. Audi 
now, I think can go all way and conquer the luxury market!</p> 
<p> By JTravolta77 on 12 June, 2011, 11:58pm </p> 
<h4> Give it a chance </h4> 
<p> I'm pretty sure black paintwork and miniscule alloys isn't showing this 
car at it's best. Once the specced up models start hitting the streets with 
18/19&quot; alloys and decent metallic colours it will be at the top of 
everyone's wishlist again. Even now I would take this over a 5 series on looks 
alone.</p>

<h4> Jtravolta77: Conquer the luxury market? </h4> 
<p> Er doubt it when you've got Masserati, Jaguar, Mercedes All offering some 
real sense of occasion to their luxury vehicles.<br>
<br>
This is just another 
bland, run out of ideas, boring Audi. Now everyone's bored of their Christmas 
tree headlights, Audi will have to find someother novel way of convincing 
people that theirs cars are better than the competition from BMW, VW and 
Mercedes.<br>
<br>
This is not in the same league as Jaguar, the new XF, wow!

<h4> Eejits </h4> 
<p> Have any of the critics above writing so negatively ever driven an Audi? I 
suspect not. The same bunch pouring out the same drivel about boring and and 
and....... Why bother reading about something which you know isn't to your 
taste? I suppose you also rate Audi's repeated wins at Le Mans as boring. Would 
be to you eejits.</p> 
<p> By xrt665 on 28 June, 2011, 8:07am </p> 
<h4> To Focus_your_mind </h4> 
<p> Well, the CEO of VW Piech has made no secret of his desire for Audi to 
overtake BMW as the world's number one luxury car maker. That's why he also 
wanted to buy Alfa Romeo from Fiat as part of the plan. I kind of see where 
youre coming from, Audi maybe don't have that intimate driver appeal or that 
certain charisma e.g Maserati or BMW but that's not say the Audi as car a 
machine it isn't a worthy alternative because for it's build quality, 
engineering and design it's arguably top right now. Think of it like a Miele 
dishwasher or Siemens washing machine!</p>
