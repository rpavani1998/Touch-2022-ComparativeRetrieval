<h3>E60 great but.....</h3> 
<p>by <strong>K10 DBC</strong> &raquo; Sun, 11 Mar 2012 18:45:33 UTC </p>  The 
only thing BMW have neglected is the sound system, so tinny and poor sound . Is 
it possible to keep the controls on steering and still show I drive when on 
display?<br>

dont think BMW have neglected their sound system as mine sounds great and its 
got bass. So i dont understand what's happened to yours maybe you need some new 
speakers?

I agree it's poor if it's standard and not upgraded. If played quietly it 
really sounds impressive to the point you want to turn it up and that 
impressiveness will maintain at high volume but it doesn't it turns to mud.

standard fit sound systems are a point of contention. I don't claim I need a 
top system in a car, but I've had the optional upgraded speakers, to get decent 
sound reproduction. The E60/1 cars I've driven have all been the basic systems 
and do lack, IMO, and need an upgrade option.<br>
<br>
But I do come from the 
time when BMW didn't even fit a standard radio, and you chose the system anyway.

<h3>Re: E60 great but.....</h3> 
<p>by <strong>jambers</strong> &raquo; Mon, 12 Mar 2012 10:10:18 UTC </p>  I 
came over from a Lexus Mark Levinson 14 speaker set up (virtual 7.2 surround) 
and I have to say that the e60 has a very poor set up for a premium car. The ML 
was truly awesome. Just a shame the car didn't drive that well.....<br>
<br>

The sub's under the seat are in an excellent place, but there are loads of 
forums showing you what you can do for about &pound;600 - upgrading to a proper 
Amp, better subs and speakers generally. Do a google search as it has been 
covered loads...  525D M Sport Auto LCI - Bamboo, Media, M spoiler, Sun

<h3>Re: E60 great but.....</h3> 
<p>by <strong>chr15gb</strong> &raquo; Mon, 12 Mar 2012 11:57:37 UTC </p>  I 
have no idea if mine is in any way &quot;upgraded&quot; from stock or not, but 
I came from a Saab which has the worse stock system ever fitted to a motor 
vehicle in the history of the gramaphone!!<br>
Seriously, it was like having an 
old Nokia phone on speaker and trying to listen to music, absolutely zero bass 
at all<br>
<br>
My 530D is perfectly fine although it does go to pot if I turn 
it up too loud.<br>
<br>
I'm going to look at the little tweeter upgrade soon 
(assuming I don't already have them). Not a cat in hells chance I am spending 
&pound;600 on an upgrade to it.

 I would agree, terrible sound quality. I have had the Audi Bose system before 
and that was brilliant, enough to convert me back from iPod to CD's, but the 
BMW setup just seems to have no depth.

<h3>Re: E60 great but.....</h3> 
<p>by <strong>diesele</strong> &raquo; Fri, 23 Mar 2012 11:00:56 UTC </p>  I 
have to agree. This is a far inferior system to the E39. Very disappointed the 
once I turned it up a bit. Falls apart and the door speakers buzz and rattle. 
I'll pop in the tweeters detailed in a guide here, but the door speaker - ist 
it a &pound;2 Chinese one and is there mileage in upgrading it? Top of the 
range car my ar$e - the system is below basic competence.  E61 535D M Sport

I disagree. My E39 had the comms pack and 
the sound was terrible until I fitted a Sony SOT amp, even then it was just 
passable. My E61 has good bass and reasonable quality sound, I have purchased 
the L7 tweeters to make it a bit better but it really isn't that bad.  E61 Lci

<h3>Re: E60 great but.....</h3> 
<p>by <strong>diesele</strong> &raquo; Fri, 23 Mar 2012 17:02:27 UTC </p>  I 
wonder if my E39 had an upgrade that I didn't know about? Happened before here 
<br> <br>
Unlike the E61 the E39 included tweeters and mid range door speakers 
that didn't fall apart with bass and start hitting the end stops and buzzing in 
the doors - I'm using the same disk here (Tiesto ) - and it didn't run out of 
puff and flat line on every bass hit at reasonable perky volumes . I'm very 
critical of it sorry - probably more so as I do a lot of sound mixing work in 
my job.<br>
<br>
I'll try to input the E39 into the newly discovered 'secret' 
options list finder - but by top of the range car stds E61 is just not good 
enough. Does it actuallyhave a small sub woofer (like the E39) did? <br>
