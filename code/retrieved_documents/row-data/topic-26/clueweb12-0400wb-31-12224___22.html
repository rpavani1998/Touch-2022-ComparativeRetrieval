<p>Look the word &ldquo;coupe&rdquo; up in the dictionary and the majority of 
the definitions suggest two-door cars. Combine the words 
&ldquo;four-door&rdquo; with &ldquo;coupe&rdquo; and you incite controversy, as
Mercedes-Benz quickly found out with its CLS-Class. Today&rsquo;s Thread of the 
Day wants to know what you think of four-door &ldquo;coupes.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Are they sleek and sexy? Or are they a waste of automaker funding? Either 
way, let the remarks commence in the comments below.</p>

<p>Call them a coupe or a sedan it&rsquo;s stiil a 4 door and not a true 2 
door sport car, they are just big 4 door monsters pretending to be sports 
cars!!!There is nothing sporty about a 4 door family car. I call them 4 door 
&ldquo;wannabe sports cars&rdquo;!!!!!</p> <br>

<p>How bou&rsquo;t we call them &ldquo;Saloons&rdquo; &ndash; I think 
that&rsquo;s what Europeans call sedans, but sounds more fitting on these!</p>

<p>Why has no one mentioned the unbelievable Audi Sportback concept? Is it 
because it is being changed too much by the time it hits production? Whatever 
it is, that car is probably the MOST BEAUTIFUL 4-Door I have ever seen. I was 
just blown away by the shape if that car. Why they didnt send that thing right 
to production as it I was is a mystery to me. I loved it so much, if I were a 
Billionaire, I would go after that car just to put it in my garage, even if I 
could never drive it. It does things to my innards that cars arent supposed to 
do. The headlights on it look a little odd but it was just the overall shape 
and the emotion, strong, sleek, yet romantic and feminine. My wife loved it to 
and she hates four door cars. As far as an alternative to 4 Dorr Coupe, which 
is retarded, Sportback is not a bad alternative, not great, but better than 4 
Door Coupe. There has to be a word that would work for this new segment, 
probably a word from another language, COME ON YOU BI AND TRI-LINGUALS, GET TO 
WORK!!!</p> <br>

<p>Coupes will always be 2 doors in my book. To me, it seems that the Germans 
don&rsquo;t like the word Sedan or Saloon for the four door vehicles. I agree 
with uraniumdragonn&hellip;they need not invade the Coupe name. All they really 
need to do is come up with their own word, like Sport Fours or something.</p>

<p>I like the sleeker sedans too, but then I love the sedans of the late 
1950&prime;s when they all sported long low profiles. I wish more cars had 
these proportions today. The name &ldquo;four door coupe&rdquo; is, of course, 
stupid. But not as bad as the Volkswagon Phaeton. I remember first hearing 
about that and getting all excited that someone was finally building a Phaeton 
again, only to be hugely disappointed when I saw it and the top didn&rsquo;t go 
down. Phaeton means four door convertible.</p> <br>

<p>If a manufacturer is too lazy and too ignorant to come up with an accurate 
and appropriate name they don&rsquo;t deserve my business. These are not bad 
looking cars and I like them much better than their more upright looking 
siblings. However, a coupe is &ldquo;a 2 seat, closed vehicle, smaller than a 
sedan according to Mr. Webster. I refuse to have my intelligence sniffed at by 
anyone. Most of all a half a$$d marketing ploy&hellip;&hellip;.</p> <br>

<p>Funnily enough, with the exception of the AM Rapide, the CLS, the CC and 
the Gran Coupe concept look more like normal sedans with their flattened. I 
can&rsquo;t really picture those cars with only 2 doors. The Jaguar XF 
isn&rsquo;t marketed as a four door coupe, yet it&rsquo;s fast roofline lends 
it a coupe0like sihlouette and I can imagine it being an actual 2 door coupe!

<p>Technically, isn&rsquo;t a coupe any car that has a certain amount of 
interior cubic space? So a 4 door can be called a coupe, depending on the 
interior space&hellip;? At least that&rsquo;s what I have read.Anyway&hellip;I 
don&rsquo;t prefer them any more than a &lsquo;regular&rsquo; sedan simply 
because of what they are called. So long as they look good. And not all of them 
do look good.</p> <br>

<p>I agree with most here, I love the aesthetic, but hate the name. The 
Four-Door Coupe style is awesome, and I think they make great alternatives to 
the traditional sedan/saloon. However, I think the terminology, 
&ldquo;Four-Door Coupe&rdquo;, is mostly helpful in the design studio as a 
descriptor of design intent, but should stay there.</p> <br>

<p>The term &ldquo;two door sedan&rdquo; has been around ever since the 
50&prime;s and is perfectly legitimate. It just meant a 2-door car with a 
pillar between the side windows, as opposed to a 2-door hardtop, which 
didn&rsquo;t have one. And any 4-door sedan usually had its equivalent 4-door 
hardtop model. So in a hardtop, if the windows were down, you could run your 
hand from the wing window to the C-pillar without hitting anything. The sedans, 
especially the 2-door ones, were considered rather low in prestige; the 
hardtops cost more and were seen as much cooler, tho yes, the windows would 
soon rattle or leak and hardtops were structurally awful in a roll-over.</p>

<p>Like many things in the automotive world, when they first come out I think 
&ldquo;WTF do they need that for?&rdquo; But then you see them for the first 
time in person, and it all makes perfect sense&hellip;..they are all (including 
the VW CC) beautiful cars. IMO, the M-B CLS is one of the sexiest cars on the 
road today&hellip;.</p> <br>

<p>they&rsquo;re so dumb! why would anyone buy one? You can get a cheaper 
version of their &ldquo;sedan&rdquo; counterparts. and a coupe has two doors; 
that&rsquo;s what makes it a coupe. sedans have 4 doors; that&rsquo;s what 
makes them sedans. So the CLS is a SEDAN. the volkswagen cc is a SEDAN. 
they&rsquo;re stylish, yes, so people who care about style should buy one. but 
a coupe? no no. i&rsquo;ll accept 4 door coupes when I see a 2 door sedan.</p>

<p>By that definition, I don&rsquo;t like coupes because I don&rsquo;t want a 
small back seat. The Aston, Mercedes and VW are coupes while the Panamera and 
Sonata are sedans.</p> <br>

<p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) distinguishes a coup&eacute; from 
a sedan (saloon) primarily by interior volume; SAE standard J1100 defines a 
coup&eacute; as a fixed-roof automobile with less than 33 cubic feet (0.93 
cubic meters) of rear interior volume. A car with a greater interior volume is 
technically a two-door sedan, not a coup&eacute;, even if it has only two 
doorshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup%C3%A9</p> <br>

<p>It is still a sedan like it or not, Coups are 2 doors, Sedans are 4 doors, 
for people with small families, who don&rsquo;t want to be caught in a station 
wagon. Some are beautiful an some are down right hideous.</p> <br>

<p>If it has 4 doors it&rsquo;s a sedan. End of story. Marketing departments 
can call it whatever they want, but it will always be a sedan.</p> <br>

<p>I love the space of 4-door coupes. They can also catch others off surprise. 
Instead of just calling them coupes though, they need to affirm that they are 
SPORTS SEDANS. They look so sleek, when done correctly of course! </p> <br>

<li> 92vectra16i Posted on: May 13, 2010&nbsp;9:21 pm Reply <br>

<p>I consider them in the vein of old school &ldquo;hardtops&rdquo; pillarless 
sedans that had a cooler vibe than their more sedate brethren :smirk: . I like 
them, but if I need a sedan, I prefer having the solid b pillar and framed door 
glass. It makes for the most solid structure and while great strides have been 
made, the fact is frameless windowed doors will rattle before framed ones. If 
you trade every 3 or 4 years or aren&rsquo;t going to put a lot of miles on a 
car,it&rsquo;s not much of a consideration, if you drive the wheels of vehicles 
then you&rsquo;ll want to keep it in mind !</p> <br>

<p>They&rsquo;re not to my taste (if I wanted a car that large, I&rsquo;d want 
something more practical), but it&rsquo;s nice that they&rsquo;re a part of the 
marketplace.</p> <br>

<p>The Passat is the only practical one, for the rest I&rsquo;m not wealthy 
enough to treat cars as fashion accessories, so no. The Aston Martin is 
beautiful, but I not even thinking of one day owning it.</p> <br>

<p>They are beautiful moving pieces of artwork. The CLS is probably the best 
example. I am also growing fond of the Panamera as well. You don&rsquo;t drive 
these cars; you make love to it.</p> <br>

<p>They certainly look nice, but they&rsquo;re not really for me. If I&rsquo;m 
going to drive a car large enough to warrant a usable back seat then I want 4 
real doors and maximum practicality. I have a Grand Marquis for a reason. 
It&rsquo;s probably the most iconic sedan shape ever and there&rsquo;s a reason 
that shape is so iconic.On another note, the window sticker for my 1992 Mercury 
Cougar claims it&rsquo;s a 2 door sedan. Go fig.</p> <br>

<p>I like them. They&rsquo;re what I look forward to buying someday with the 
excuse to my wife that it&rsquo;s still has four doors, so we could fit some 
kids in there if we need to. Do I like the name? No. I wish we would dig up 
some great name from the early days of the car that means the same thing, or 
re-tool something, like how some automakers are tempting the idea of bringing 
back the idea of a shooting brake here in the U.S. Just give me a new name to 
call them, that sounds simple and reasonable, and I&rsquo;ll be cool.</p> <br>

<p>They&rsquo;re beautiful cars, the epitome of sports SEDANS. If sedan 
doesn&rsquo;t fit, make up a new name for the class, like 
&ldquo;crossover&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tiny SUV&rdquo;. The whole 
&ldquo;four door coupe&rdquo; thing is an oxymoron, and the engineers and 
designers put too much work into the cars and made them too stylish to be 
force-fit into an oxymoronic name.</p> <br>

<li> IBx1 Posted on: May 13, 2010&nbsp;5:55 pm Reply <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like the name. The cars aren&rsquo;t too bad, but 
they&rsquo;re all german. The CC looks very plain when not next to other boring 
VW&rsquo;s on the dealer lot, and the CLS has a very anonymous front end. The 
BMW concept looks pretty plain overall, and I&rsquo;d consider the Aston a true 
4-door supercar, not a coupe. AM still builds REAL coupes after all.So no, I 
guess not. Give me a coupe, or give me a handsome sedan. Or give me a truck.</p>

<p>If a car has four doors it should be called a sedan, if it has two it has 
to be called a coupe. If it has the characteristics of a coupe, you could a 
call it a coupe-like sedan :confused:</p> <br>
