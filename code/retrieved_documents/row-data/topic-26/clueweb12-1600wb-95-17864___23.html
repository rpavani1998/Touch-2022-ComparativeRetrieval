<h1> AUDI A4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h1> 
<p>For The A4 Avant is spacious and handles well. It is a desirable car, too
</p> 
<p>Against The estate car is poor over bumps and is potentially pricey. The 
rear seats don't fold flat.</p> 
<p>Verdict The A4 Avant is a very competent, classy estate, but overall it's 
just beaten by the competition from BMW and Mercedes</p> 
<p> Gallery View Gallery Images </p> <br>

<ul> 
<li>What's it like?</li> 
<li>Which one do I get?</li> 
<li>Running Costs?</li> 
<li>What to look for?</li> </ul> 
<h1>What's it like?</h1> 
<p>Audi has a good reputation for building classy wagons, and the A4 Avant 
lives up to that. The styling is more sports hatch than load-lugger, but even 
so the boot is a good size and easy to load, although some rivals are slightly 
bigger. Unfortunately the rear seats don't fold completely flat, which makes 
loading longer items awkward. The handling is balanced and there's good grip 
through bends. Pity the steering can feel artificially light at times and 
doesn't provide more feedback. The ride is on the firm side, if not quite as 
severe as that of the BMW 3 Series - although the A4 Avant struggles on poor 
surfaces. The cabin is well laid out and spacious enough for four adults. 
Visibility is good, and the driver's seat is easily adjustable to suit most 
people. The A4 is no longer the class leader in terms of fit and finish, but 
the cabin is still build with high quality, solid feeling-materials.</p> <br>

<h1>Which one should I get?</h1> 
<p>You'll need a good reason not to consider the diesel models. The 2.0-litre 
TDI engines, with between 118bhp and 168bhp, are the best option - not only for 
availability, but for running costs and residual values, too. There's also a 
2.7-litre, with 187bhp and a CVT auto gearbox, plus a quattro four-wheel-drive 
237bhp 3.0-litre. There is no automatic 'box option on the 2.0-litre, but the 
3.0 litre is also available with an S-tronic semi-auto gearbox. The petrol 
versions start with the punchy and refined 1.8-litre TFSI, with between 118bhp 
and 158bhp, and a 2.0-litre version with 208bhp. Both are available with a CVT 
auto gearbox. The four-wheel-drive 261bhp 3.2-litre is more of a car for keen 
drivers, but rare on the used market. Entry-level specification is good with 
stability control, electric windows all round, climate control and remote 
central locking, while SE adds alloy wheels, parking sensors, and upgraded 
stereo and cabin trim, and multi-zone climate control. The S-Line version sits 
on lowered sports suspension with larger alloys, plus sporty cabin trim and a 
body styling kit.</p> <br>

<h1>What are the running costs?</h1> 
<p>Predictably the diesel A4s are cheapest to run, with stronger residual 
values and much better fuel economy than the petrols. The 2.0-litre diesels 
average between 55.4 and 47.9mpg, with the 2.7-litre at 44.1mpg and the 
3.0-litre managing 42.8mpg. Compare that with the 1.8-litre petrol at 39.8mpg, 
the 2.0-litre with between 42.8mpg and 38.2, and the 3.2-litre at 31.7mpg. 
Servicing costs are on a par with those of rivals, but Audi dealers tend to 
have some of the highest labour rates. You'll save by switching to a reliable 
independent garage, or you could try a franchised dealer from one of the other 
VW Group of companies (Skoda, Seat and VW). They share many of the engines and 
gearboxes, so should be able to carry out any work. It's too soon to assess the 
A4 Avant's long-term reliability. So far there are few reported issues, but the 
previous version has a reputation for being less than perfect.</p> 
<h1>What should I look out for?</h1> 
<p>Few problems have been reported so far, with most owners happy with their 
cars. There are some complaints about notchy or noisy gearboxes, but this 
doesn't appear to affect their performance. Most A4s start life as company or 
fleet cars. Have a thorough look at the car and check it has been cared for. 
Heavily kerbed alloys could mean the steering alignment is out, and tyres will 
wear faster than expected. Also look for damage to the bumpers caused by 
careless reversing. Make sure the service history is complete, and that 
high-mileage cars have been serviced at the correct intervals.</p>
