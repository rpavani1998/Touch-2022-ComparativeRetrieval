<h3>#1 of 8 <strong>future audi platform models.</strong> by dhamilton </h3> 
<h4> Jan 04, 2007 (1:13 pm) </h4> I'm starting this because I'm very exctited 
about the future of Audi. For years they have been chided for being unbalanced, 
under steering pigs. With this new platform, I think Audi is poised to make a 
serious run at the segment leader BMW.

<h3>#2 of 8 <strong>Autospies</strong> by dhamilton </h3> 
<h4> Jan 04, 2007 (1:19 pm) </h4> has a little bit of info regarding the new 
A5. It will be released as a concept at the Geneva auto show in february.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 Rumors are that it can be set up for understeer, or oversteer. It's 
unclear if this will happen electronically, via MMI or some other device, or if 
it will be a sold order option only.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Hopefully we can discuss 
the need for Audi to increase horsepower in the 6 cylinder range, with light 
turbo charging as well, ala BMW, or the older, but excellent 2.7T motor.

</h5> You must mean the 
SALES leader IN the US market, for the Audi is the SALES leader in the German 
market. From time to time the BMW will be the sales champ, then the Audi will 
swap with it. However, the difference in SALES between the two is typically not 
as great elsewhere as it is in the US.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 This has been the case 
for years.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 These two German Rivals are (and have been) close 
in performance and the nod for value has often gone to Audi.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
My buddy, and I remember this as if it were yesterday, leased a new 2001 5 
series (6 cylinder, RWD, no sat nav, no sport suspension, tiny tires and 
wheels, etc.) Unknown to him, I leased a new 2001 A6 4.2L quattro sport with a 
built in phone, ESP, sat nav and sport everything.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 My MSRP was 
within $200 of his.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 I had an AWD V8 sport suspension equipped 
German LPS car that was far more car.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 An A6 2.7T was less 
money than the Bimmer and still was able to outgun the 5 Bimmer.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Thus it has almost always been. More performance (year round) better warranty 
and service agreements, lower lease payments and tail lights shown to the BMW 
due to far more torque from the Audis (at lower dollars and for equal dollars.)
<br> &nbsp;<br>
 Audis reputation for unintended acceleration, its financial 
woes at the time and a better BMW dealer body by far far far has certainly 
taken its toll.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The product as of the C6 took a major upgrade 
in feature, function and reliability. I would argue the QUALITY and fit and 
finish and DESIGN often favored the Audi line.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Reading 
HISTORY, the BMW reliability was not heads and tails better than the Audis over 
the years. But the dealer body, er, kinda sucked.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Now, who 
knows, the Audi quality meter is certainly at a relative zenith but we need at 
least a few more years of the kind of reliability these C6's seem to represent 
to cement this with the US buying market.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 When you get to 
drive these cars EXTENSIVELY back to back, you realize there is much to 
recommend the Audi. But, none of this should suggest I believe the BMW is 
clearly superior or that the Audi is likewise.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 These are 
similar cars, very similar. The fact that they approach what they do somewhat 
differently is a given. The fact that they often outsell each other is, at the 
very least, suggestive.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 I would gladly have a BMW 530xi or an 
Audi A6 3.2, price being the reason for the final decision.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 To 
me, Audi has figured out AWD slightly better than BMW -- but the differences 
are very very subtle, no matter how you splain it.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The Audi 
has a better AWD system. The BMW is better balanced. The BMW can be had with a 
stick shift. What amazes me is how few people who buy BMWS actually buy the 
stick shift -- Audi figures it is simply not worth marketing in NA, I would 
assume. Every stick Audi I have had was a special order. Of course the BMW 
dealer also has zero sticks for sale, too.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Then you go to the 
Japanese, they are sneaking up on the feel of the Germans, if not quite the 
look. Audi interiors are so good, one would expect the Japanese would simply 
copy them as they have, historically, copied so many other things.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> Now, however, the Japanese are starting to move away from innovation to 
invention -- and this is good for the market.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The Americans, 
who knows what they are doing -- however, American brands have improved so much 
that I would be happy to have several of them in my garage.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
Without driving one, I must applaud Saturn, for one, for producing convincing 
contemporary cars. There is no reason for Saturn to hang its head when they 
can, today, produce such vehicles as the Aura and the Outlook (the SUV?, yes?)
<br> &nbsp;<br>
 Anyway, Audi has a lot of stuff in the pipeline that looks 
exciting and quite possibly class leading (at least for 15 minutes) -- and I 
for one continue to believe Audi is more like the cars it is often compared to 
than it is different.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The S6 beating the M5 in two magazine 
comparos is certainly a reason to consider Audi as a serious competitor.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 Drive it like you live.

</h5> Mark, Thanks 
for helping out the thread. Boy oh boy, it's been blowing up you as you can see.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 I don't know if you've noticed but according to Inside 
Line, Audi has something set for debut in Detroit, on Sunday at around noon 
[tomorrow] I wonder if this is the first official NA showing of the R8? Or, 
could it be the A5, surprising us all?<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Fifth Gear has a 
comparo of the RS4 vs M3csl. The Audi wins the track event, and the 
acceleration event, but loses the drifting competition. [not quite sure who 
didn't guess that one]<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Anyway, the debate rages on, two wheel 
VS four wheel<br>

</h5> According to 
&quot;Quattro Quarterly&quot;, the Audi Club magazine:<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 326hp 
&amp; 560 lb/ft, although it does not state at which rpm's these values were 
measured.<br>
 They do quote a 21 mpg fuel consumption during mixed hwy &amp; 
city driving.<br>
 Also in the Q7 it went from 0-62 mph in 6.4 seconds with a 
top speed of 147 mph.

<h3>#7 of 8 <strong>Hi:</strong> by thefundu </h3> 
<h4> Nov 11, 2010 (11:33 am) </h4> Hi guys, I am new to this forum but had 
been writing about Audi's from since about 6 months. Right from A1, the cars 
are been marked as perfect machines. The A4 segment is quite awesome in both 
performance as well as value for money.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new segment A7, which is covering the 
space between A6 and A8 is till now been good in impressing all the luxury 
seekers in its long distinctive look as well as its soothing features. Its 
rivals like BMW GT and Mercedes Benz CLS seem to be on different tracks and 
offer a varying platform.<br>
 At the end, I guess A7 is gonna have a great 
future in long luxuries segment, no doubt.
