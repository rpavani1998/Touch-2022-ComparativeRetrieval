bearings and hubs for your BMW, Audi, VW, Mercedes, Volvo and Porsche. We have 
carefully selected only the lines we feel will provide you with the quality you 
expect on your european car.  Get the bearings designed for your car by the 
manufacturer. Our line of wheel bearings and hubs consists of OEM (Original 
Equipment Manufacturer) and Genuine (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Porsche, Volvo 
branded ) parts. We also have a significant selection of wheel bearings and 
hubs as well from top suppliers including FAG, Ruville, &amp; SKF.  If you are 
hearing a groaning sound coming from your car&rsquo;s front end, be sure to 
check your wheel bearings immediately. Its likely that the noise is coming from 
a bad wheel bearing. This project will take a little time to remove and 
replace, but the bearing is pretty cost effective. It is however very important 
to check and replace your wheel bearing right away to prevent damage to other 
components. This is a MAJOR safety component of your car.  The wheel bearings 
on you car sit between the axle and the wheel hub and allow your wheels to spin 
freely. These bearings carry the weight of your car, and their must be no slop 
or movement side to side or they can fail rapidly. Bad wheel bearings will 
adversely affect your steering, braking, and fuel economy.
