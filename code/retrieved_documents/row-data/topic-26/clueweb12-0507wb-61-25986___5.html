<h1>The Advantages of Diesel Fuel</h1>  &nbsp;  Diesel fuel is more powerful 
and efficient than gas  Diesel prices are higher than gas prices due to demand  
Biodiesel is a non-fossil fuel alternative  &nbsp; 
<p> When crude oil is refined, it can be made into many different types of 
fuel such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel. This is done using a special 
separation process. Diesel fuel has a higher energy density than regular 
gasoline, making it more powerful and efficient, which is why it gets better 
mileage. A vehicle with a diesel engine can travel an average of 30% further 
than a vehicle with a gas engine.<strong>Diesel prices</strong> are a bit 
higher than gas prices due to demand but makes up for it with efficiency.</p> 
<p>Although diesel engines and gas engines are similar, diesel fuel can only 
be used in a diesel engine. Both diesel and gas engines covert fuel into energy 
through a series of small combustions. The major difference between diesel and 
gas is the way these combustions happen. In a gas engine, fuel is mixed with 
air, compressed by pistons and ignited by sparks from the spark plugs. In a 
diesel engine, the air is compressed first and then the fuel is injected. 
Because air heats up when it&rsquo;s compressed, the fuel ignites. Diesel 
engines are used for a wide variety of things other than just cars including 
transport trucks, boats, trains and farm equipment. Therefore it is very 
important to our economy.</p> 
<p>Diesel fuel has been gaining in popularity around the world due to its many 
benefits. Diesel powered vehicles not only have better fuel economy than 
gasoline engines, they also produce lessgreenhouse gas emissions. Diesel 
engines used to be smelly and noisy, but they have since been improved with 
modern technology.</p> 
<p>Biodiesel is a non-fossil fuel alternative to petro-diesel that can be used 
in diesel engines, without needing to modify the engine. It&rsquo;s made from 
plant oils or animal fats and can be combined with diesel or used on it&rsquo;s 
own. Bio-diesel is an environmentally friendly renewable resource. It also 
reduces emissions, it&rsquo;s biodegradable, it&rsquo;s safer to transport and 
handle and reduces dependence on foreign oil. It&rsquo;s currently being used 
in both public and private vehicles.</p> 
<p>Biodiesel is expected to continue to gain popularity and become more 
readily available in the future. In the U.S., soybean oil is the main oil being 
used but it can be made with any vegetable oil using a process called
transesterification. Even used cooking oil from restaurants can be can be used 
although it needs to be cleaned first. This allows for the recycling of used 
oils which is also good for the environment.</p> 
<p>Some car models that are available with diesel engines include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>2008 Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec: This sedan model uses a type of injection 
technology called AdBlue that meets even the toughest emissions standards. It 
reduces nitrogen-oxide levels to the point that the diesel is as clean as the 
E350&prime;s gasoline version. 23 mpg city/32 mpg hwy.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>2008 Mercedes-Benz GL320 CDI: This is a large 6 passenger SUV. It has an 
adjustable suspension and an off-road mode that make it great for rough 
terrain. 18 mpg city/24 mpg hwy.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>2009 VW Jetta TDI: One of the cleanest diesel vehicles available, it uses 
a NOx-storage catalyst system. The catalyst is basically a filter that traps 
offensive emissions. Periodically, the engine will switch to an air-fuel 
mixture that will burn off the material in the traps. 30 mpg city/41 mpg hwy.
