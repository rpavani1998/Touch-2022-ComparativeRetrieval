<p> The quality of our two Audis has been fine. I had a 2000 TT Quattro for 
four years and it performed very well. I then bought a 2004 A4 3.0 with a six 
speed manual which has been great. It's got about 65,000 miles and we've had 
only routine maintenance -- nothing out of the ordinary. My son now drives the 
A4 and loves it. Our other vehicles are Acuras (a 2006 RL and a 2003 MDX with 
150,000 miles) and they, too, have been virtually trouble-free though they are 
not as entertaining to drive as the Audis. &nbsp;<br>

<p> I own a 2000 Audi TT 95,000 miles on it and I haven't had many problems at 
all. I had to replace the clutch at about 85k but considering the way I drive 
it that was no surprise and I think it lasted longer than most. I'll be 
replacing the timing belt before long because they recommend replacing it every 
90-100k miles but aside from that, take care of your car and it wont give you 
many issues. I love my Audi you'll get no complaints from me. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Hi , I have never owned a Audi, Love the cars and thinking of Purchasing 
one, I currently own a Chrysler product, And I'll tell ya there's No comparison 
as to repairing a chrysler, Because it never ends. I just fix one thing and 
another is broken. I'VE HAD IT WITH DOMESTIC CRAP!!!<br>
 &nbsp;Looking for 
some good and bad advice on The Audi A4 2000-2005 all models all engines. Is It 
worth the purchase? &nbsp;<br>

<p> I own a 2002 Audi A6 Avant with 51,000 miles on it and it is the worst car 
I have owned in many years.<br>
It is almost totally unreliable and the dealer 
is a liar and a thief. I have spent almost $5,000 in repairs (right front and 
left rear corners replaced, for instance)since the warranty ran out two years 
ago and I will never own another Audi. I also own a Mercedes and a BMW and the 
Mercedes is very reliable as is the BMW, but the BMW can be expensive to repair 
at times, but nothing to match the Audi. I do like the Audi all wheel drive 
feature, but that's all. Incidentally, the Mercedes is an SL600 which I have 
heard is expensive to maintain but ours has been trouble free. I will be 
replacing the Audi with an American four wheel drive vehicle but haven't 
decided which one. &nbsp;<br>

<p> I purchased a 2001 TT roadster new and still own it. &nbsp;I love it and 
still get compliments on its looks. &nbsp;However, there is no complements for 
Audi, the company and its dealership. &nbsp;The dealers kept deflecting 
diagnosis of the defective instrument panel &nbsp;chip which caused a myriad of 
problems until they wore me out and I paid for the replacement myself. $1000 
for a part they knew was bad. Now the TT works perfectly. &nbsp;Audi in UK 
reimbursed all who had paid for this repair themselves. &nbsp; I would carry a 
battery booster in the trunk to start the car if it was not used for 2 days. 
&nbsp;Letters to Audi and DOT went on deaf ears. This problem was endemic for 
this year/model- google audi TT instrument panel<br>
Although it runs 
perfectly, I would never go near an Audi again. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Seems to be a trend in many of these posts. &nbsp;Lots of the folks with 
steady problems seem to own an A6 or TT. &nbsp;We've heard many of the same 
stories. &nbsp;Doesn't mean everybody with these cars, but still seem to be the 
problem prone models.<br>
<br>
We're big fans of Audi in general. &nbsp;And the 
A4 is a great car. &nbsp;Maintaining a German car is never cheap, but owning 
one can be worth well worth it. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Everyone has a story about their car, good and bad. The story does not 
represent the truth as it does not represent the thousands, or millions sold. 
So be it.<br>
<br>
My own experience<br>
- Audi 5000s 1986 200K+ miles, runs 
perfect. Needs occassional new tires, new brakes, oil change. Never failed to 
start. Only issue now are the window seals on which the rubber is starting to 
fail.<br>
- Audi 100 1989 180K miles, ran great, needed a auto trans rebuild at 
140K, loved it but it got hit by a truck and totaled.<br>
- Audi 100s 1994 115K 
miles, only problems seem to be on the trans and engine seals. I travel quite a 
bit and let it sit for months at a time which dried out the seals. People think 
it is a 2001 car.<br>
- Audi A4 1998 1.8T 84K miles, my daughters car. Only 
maintenance issue has been a new turbo failed at 74K.<br>
<br>
I have no 
compalints, normal maintenance only. No major problems. Yet I have heard horror 
stories - same as other car brands.<br>

<p> I also have an Audi Q7. I have over 17,500 miles on it and it so far 
hasn't given me any issues. I've since met many Audi owners. It's almost like a 
colt. Always getting freindly gestures and compliments from other owners on the 
road. The ones I've spoken to all love their Audis and praise the quality and 
reliability. I'm a bit confused. I know the history of Audi and understand that 
in the past they were rally cars, much like the WRX and Evo of back in the day 
and not considered a pristigious brand. They come from humble origins which is 
partly why the reliability may have been inferior in the past and scarred some 
people. That, or knowing their relation to Volkswagen makes people assume 
they'll inherit all their old problems too. It's plain ignorance. Porshe, 
Bently and Bugatti are also owned by the VW group and they don't have many 
issues either. I also love the attention to detail in my Audi. It's the same as 
a Porshe Cyenne only bigger, better fuel economy, more practical, and not as 
stuffy. It's a joy to drive and I've never been happier. I don't think half of 
you know what you're talking about. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Everyone has different experiences. My bad luck has always been with 
Toyota of all things. My wifes 05' Corolla has had countless issues, like roof 
leaks, the bumber falling off, and the pieces of the bumer falling off that 
make it the &quot;sport model&quot;. They simply attach extra bits of plastic 
to the stock bumper and call it Sport so they can charge more. Everytime we 
take it in they're rude as hell and try to pin it on my wife. It's only got 
15,000 miles on it! Her parents who were convinced that Toyota was God bought 
two matching 07' Camrys. Roof leaks, plastic peices inside falling apart and 
scratch easily. Cheap junk. Good motor and engineering as far as the 
mechanicals go I'm sure, but cheap junk everywhere else. Lexus is the same. Use 
fake plastic coating and call it woodgrain. It's clearly not real wood. I'm not 
convinced it's real leather either. And I wouldn't be suprised if the glass was 
fake somehow too! It's the select brand Audi. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Okay, as a high mileage driver of a 2007 Audi Cabriolet 2.0T Quattro, I 
have had some major disappointments in Audi engineering. First of all the 
weight of a Mazda Miata over the front tires that are the same size as the 
front tires on a Supra or a Cayman with a standard load rating when there is an 
XL available in the same model! 3 blow outs later and the discovery of 46psi 
used in the FWD S-line version I bought bigger tires with a 102 load rating 
rather than the OE 94 and use a much more responsive 46 psi.<br>
<br>
The power 
seats do no fully recline like the sedans even though there is a room.<br>
<br>

Over 3,900 lbs. and only 200bhp? You get outgunned by commercial vans! Turbo V6 
anyone? ....and might as well use the A6 platform to balance the weight and add 
more room in the back since it's not so sporting.<br>
<br>
Red gages that look 
like 80s video games.<br>
<br>
The plastic glove box is always popping open.<br>

<p> Audi knows exactly what Americans have typically wanted: Giant lumbering 
SUVs that no one can see around, the driver of which can't stay in their own 
lane, are single guys without a family or need for such a large POS, but it's 
big enough for them to keep their Big Mac and fries in.<br>
<br>
Please, Audi 
released the A3, an economical, exuberantly fun to drive vehicle with great 
storage capabilities. What do Americans buy, the Q7. Why, because we think 
bigger is better, or the guys and women that drive them must feel inadequate 
and require a large vehicle to make them feel better. LOL.<br>
<br>
Ok, 
seriously though, both BMW (with the 1 series) and Audi (with the A3) tried to 
predict silly American values with those vehicles. Personally, I can't wait 
until everyone can see at least two cars in front of them &nbsp;while drivintg 
since they won't have to try to look around some giant POS SUV that's in the 
way.<br>
<br>
Whoohoo, rant complete!  &nbsp; <br>

<p> I have to agreee with you here. I currently own a 330XI and it has been 
terrible. BMW has been heading in the wrong direction since the 2nd iteration 
of the E46 chassis. The E90 is ugly, and though the 335i has a fantastic 
engine, it has still diminished in road feel. They moved towards hardcore 
luxury with a hint of performance instead of their bread and butter E36 chassis 
performance that was worthy of the Ultimate Driving Machine designation. 
Reliability is always an afterthought, I would always lease a German car, not 
purchase it, and definitely not own one outside of the warranty period!<br>
<br>
Infiniti owns the Germans in performance and luxury (maybe not so much in the 
latter) right now. Torque down low, and enough HP to run with the turbo six 
from BMW. If only the rear seats folded down... Heck, if they could add 2MPG by 
reducing power by about 30 HP, I'd buy two of them! &nbsp;<br>

<p> LOL, nice conclusion. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Those damned coilpacks. Both VW/Audi 
and BMW has issues with them over the years. I am planning to evaluate an A4 
when the '09s hit the showrooms, and the only truly disappointing thing about 
the vehicle is that I didn't notice that the S-tronic trans will be available 
on the 4 banger. I love that trannie, and that engine. My friend's GTI, as all 
of the review mags have stated, shifts faster than a human could ever imagine, 
and is totally clean while doing so. Brilliant idea, now they just need to make 
it reliable! &nbsp; <br>

<p> Wow, the forum app is counterintuitive. It doesn't autoquote when yuo 
choose Reply to a specific post. Oh well, maybe I'm missing something.There's 
simply no quote option. My above three posts were in response to other posts. 
Go figure....... &nbsp;<br>
