<h1>Next Audi A8 Pushed Back, Plus Audi Plans for 2010 and Beyond </h1> 
<h2>Audi&#146;s future includes A1, A5 and A7 Sportbacks, Q3, a new A2, and 
more.</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>June 2009</li> 
<li> BY JENS MEINERS </li> 
<li>  MULTIPLE ILLUSTRATORS </li> </ul> 
<ul>

<p> In a bid to better enable itself to overtake Mercedes-Benz and BMW and 
become the leading international premium brand, Audi has adjusted the timing of 
a number of future products, including the next generation of its A8 flagship. 
The2010 A8 is being pushed back from a September debut at the Frankfurt auto 
show, where the launch was originally intended to take place. The car instead 
will be unveiled some time after December&rsquo;s Los Angeles auto show; 
we&rsquo;ve heard it may happen at an exclusive event in Florida. The Detroit 
auto show will be the first to host the new A8.</p> 
<p> Launching the new A8 away from an auto show will make sure the new car 
isn't buried among a flurry of international unveilings. Audi wants to play up 
the design theme, and the aluminum-structured A8 will be another large step 
forward for the brand, particularly inside the cabin. It will boast, for 
example, the next-generation MMI system, which will then trickle down to other 
models.</p> 
<p> Audi also doesn't want to kill sales of the current model. The A8 is still 
selling well in several markets, and a Frankfurt launch might bring orders to a 
halt before the new A8 arrives in dealerships in the spring of 2010. The A8 is 
one of the most significant cars for the brand; in Europe and China, the 
current model is a legitimate alternative to the S-class and the 7-series. 
Positioned as the sportiest luxury sedan, it was quickly seen as a welcome 
alternative to former BMW customers alienated by that brand&rsquo;s polarizing 
styling and iDrive system.</p> 
<p> With the next model, Audi wants to catch up in the U.S. and the rest of 
the world, too. Expect an engine lineup similar to the current one, including a 
naturally aspirated W-12. According to one Audi insider, the main reason for 
delaying the A8 is the economy; it&rsquo;s not a good time to be launching 
ultraluxury cars that you expect to sell in high volumes.</p> 
<p> <b>A5 Sportback and R8 Spyder Coming to Frankfurt</b> </p> 
<p> The A5 Sportback, details on which are due soon, won't have that last 
problem. A hatchback sedan based on the A5 coupe, it will be a niche vehicle 
and play up Audi's emphasis on design. Unlike its somewhat plump competitor, 
the upcoming BMW 5-series Gran Turismo, the A5 Sportback looks sleek, with low, 
sporty lines.</p> 
<p> The A5 Sportback will be exhibited at the Frankfurt show, as will the R8 
Spyder. With its fabric roof, the R8 Spyder takes a classic approach. The 
conversion looks so good that you might think the R8 was styled with a topless 
version in mind from the beginning, which wasn&rsquo;t the case, according to 
chief exterior designer Stefan Sielaff.</p> 
<p> Audi's other hatchback sedan, the A7 Sportback, will be unveiled well into 
2010. The Audi Sportback concept unveiled in Detroit this past January provides 
a clear idea of what the finished product will look like. Significantly longer 
than the A5 Sportback and more independent in style, it will be positioned 
between the A6 and the A8.</p> 
<p> <b>A1 and A2, and Away We Go . . .</b> </p> 
<p> Far bigger news for 2010 is the A1, a compact, three-door hatchback that 
shares many components with the new Volkswagen Polo. It is positioned well 
below the A3, which itself is due to be replaced in 2011. That year will also 
see the launch of a five-door A1, and the Q3&mdash;whichrecently was confirmed 
for production&mdash;a crossover based on the Golf/A3 platform and built by 
VW's subsidiary SEAT in Spain. The A6 is due to be replaced at that time, as 
well.</p> 
<p> So Audi has a lot on its plate until 2011. What's next? Audi is 
considering its own variation of the tinyVolkswagen Up, and one possibility on 
that platform is an all-electric version. Another possibility is a version 
powered by a conventional combustion engine that could achieve well over 110 
mpg in the European cycle.</p> 
<p> Another project currently being explored is a second-generation A2. The 
fully aluminum A2&mdash;sold in Europe from 1999 to 2005&mdash;was a commercial 
failure despite sales of around 175,000 units, but it is nevertheless highly 
regarded as a technological breakthrough for small cars. It flopped because it 
was expensive and because it wasn&rsquo;t particularly sporty; for most of its 
life, the top two engines made a measly 75 hp. Audi added more powerful engines 
late in the A2&rsquo;s life, but they weren&rsquo;t enough to spur success and 
the car was axed.</p> 
<p> Now the A2 may come back. There are currently three styling proposals, but 
whichever is chosen, the car would again be a technological showcase when (and 
if) it launches in 2013 or 2014. It would, however, be developed with 
production costs in mind, and therefore a full aluminum body is unlikely. Audi 
could instead opt to use an aluminum/steel hybrid body, as it does with the 
current TT.</p> 
<p> In our talks with Audi engineers and designers, their mood is noticeably 
upbeat despite the current economic crisis. Styling and R&amp;D are working in 
harmony, and our feeling is that if Audi can continue to produce the types of 
vehicles we&rsquo;ve seen recently, BMW and Mercedes will have a lot to worry 
about&mdash;and soon.</p> View Photo Gallery PHOTOS (27) <br>
