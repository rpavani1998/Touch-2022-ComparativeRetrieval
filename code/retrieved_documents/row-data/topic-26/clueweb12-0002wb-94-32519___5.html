<p> I have had 2 Audis and have had a lot of repair problems. &nbsp;The last 
was an A6 I had for 4 years. &nbsp;I have heard that about two years ago sales 
fell off and Audi hired a Daimler-Chrysler person to improve quality. &nbsp;As 
nearly as I can determine, about every 3rd Audi has lots of problems. 
&nbsp;Does anyone know if build quality has improved? &nbsp;<br>

<p> I too have had two Audi's,one of which was the first TT. That was a 
disaster. I adored the TT in spite of the four tows that were required in the 
two years I had the car, but I finally got tired of being stranded on the road. 
Audi was unfailingly ready to fix things (totally replaced the dash, the sound 
system, the transmission, and the heating/cooling system, and always provided a 
lovely Audi to drive while mine was being fixed) but it got old. The other was 
a 5000S diesel back in the days when diesel was a big pain. It was a fine car, 
except for the problems inherent in diesels. Now I have just purchased an A3, 
and it reminds me of why I loved the TT. I fervently hope that it's 
problem-free (don't we all), and I believe that it will be or I wouldn't have 
bought it, but we will see. According to all the reviews I found, reliability 
is average, and customer satisfaction with the A3 is outstanding. &nbsp;<br>

<p> We don't learn quickly, do we? &nbsp;I too owned two Audi's. &nbsp;Each 
was beset with mechanical failures.<br>
<br>
Although on paper the body 
designs, engine specs and interior ambiance really appeals to me, the extremely 
poor reliability of these machines keep me from even considering them again for 
purchase.<br>
<br>
In fact, my opinion of the other two major German builders, 
MB and BMW, has diminished with my also having reliability issues with each 
model I have owned.<br>
<br>
The German mystic is, in my opinion, simply good 
advertising. &nbsp;The cost of a quality German luxury sedan is much too high 
when compared to the prices asked by Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. &nbsp;My 
experience owning cars by these Japanese makers has been excellent. &nbsp;They 
have been reiable, comfortable and outstanding perfomers.<br>
<br>
It is a 
shame that the high degree of quality that once was a mark of German autombile 
makering seems to have beomce a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
What I want in a 
high-end car is to be able to drive it each day and not simply wait for the 
shop to repair it. &nbsp;<br>

<p> I sell Audi-BMW-Porsche automobiles . The quality of Audi and that of BMW 
needs to be improved . Porsche is far from perfect but they are better that all 
other German cars . I have owned many cars over the years including many 
Japanese and German brands . I enjoy driving the German cars , I prefer owning 
the Japenese cars . My fear regarding the quality issues of German cars is that 
they &nbsp;will not improve but in fact may get worse as our dollar continues 
to fall . I consider myself a well liked , knowledgeable salesperson with a 
great client base . When I meet a new - potential customer for the first time I 
take pains in pointing out both the good and bad of German cars . I present the 
facts as I know them and the consumer is better able to make a decision . &nbsp;

<p> As much as it bites me in the ass to say this,you are not there to inform 
the customer-you are there to sell whatever car it is you're selling.<br>
<br>

If you have this much concern for the quality of the cars you are selling then 
you might want to go sell Infinity's and Lexus's.<br>
<br>
Sadly,German cars of 
all makes are suffering from the effects of the 'making them at the lowest 
cost' process.<br>
<br>
Cost cutting and no concern for the history of the 
brand is destroying the German car market.<br>
<br>
Soon,they will be buying 
Korean built 'German cars',rebadging them and selling them worldwide as German.
<br><br>
I heard about Audi reliability problems ten years ago and now alot of 
&nbsp;BMW's and Mercedes having them too.<br>
<br>
Really sad.<br>
<br>
They 
will drive the customers to the Japanese makes. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Hammatime , <br>
<br>
You are entitled to your opinion , I do not think 
you are correct . I work hard , I am honest and most of the time I am rewarded 
for it . I think being informative is an important part of my job . I am not 
there &quot;just to sell&quot; I am there to promote the products that I 
represent and to build relationships with my customer base . &nbsp;<br>

<p> Audi has done an incredible job with the look of this car. &nbsp;In terms 
of build quality I will always think German engineers are top notch. 
&nbsp;Every car maker puts out the occasional lemon, but I've yet to own or 
drive a German automobile that registered a complaint for me, and that includes 
Audi's A6. &nbsp;There's been a lot of hub-bub around this car lately and I saw 
a good interview with an Audi brand specialist that explains a lot about the R8 
and it's design and build ( www.wsw.com/show ). &nbsp;<br>

<p> The Audi today cannot be compared to an Audi of even 10 years ago. 
&nbsp;All cars in fact have significantly improved their vehicles in terms of 
quality. &nbsp;Although I am a TT owner, I can tell you that I will never 
purchase an automatic TT (s-tronic) they are trying to push here in the USA. 
&nbsp;In fact, I do not know any TT owner that would purchase the new TT. 
&nbsp;Audi removed most of the great features to make it a vanilla sports car. 
&nbsp;Too bad. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
My only true complaint with Audi is the sound 
and navigation systems. &nbsp;Compared to Japan, they are an embarrassment.

<p> I guess you know that in the rest of the civilized world, the A3 is 
available with Bluetec, which gets well over 50 mpg. &nbsp;Once again, this is 
an excellent example of Audi not understanding their market here in the USA.

<p> I have owned three Audis and have not had overwhelming trouble with any of 
them. The only problem I had was with the compressor on my 1993 90CS, with my 
1999 A6 no trouble at all and now with my 2001 A8L I just drive and drive. And 
as far as navigation, Audi's is twice as good as the navigation in my 2003 CLK 
convertible.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the site, it's a great one. &nbsp; <br>

<p> I'm now on my 7th Audi, in a history that includes the following: 
&nbsp;1974 100LS, 1980 80GLS (UK car), 1982 4000, 1985 Coupe GT, 1989 90 
Quattro, 1992 100S, and 1999 A6 Quattro (still my daily driver). &nbsp;Except 
for the '74 100LS and '85 GT, all have been exceptionally reliable. &nbsp;Maybe 
the quality has been deteriorating during the latest decade. &nbsp;Pity, as 
I've recently started thinking about which Audi to get next... &nbsp;<br>

<p> I am having a hard time believing these post are actual audi customers. My 
family - Including my parents have been long term audi owners with an 
occasional Cadillac and Bmw. We have had mild issues with most of the vehicles 
but nothing out of the ordinary and the Audis tend to have fewer major issues 
and fewer visits to the shop. I currently own an Q7 and a 2008 TT and would not 
even consider any other brand &nbsp;at this point. My family has met many many 
other &nbsp;Audi groups and even toured with these groups from time to time. 
The cars have always been the best option when you are looking for something a 
little more comfortable and unique over other German brands. I regularly use 
the TT on &nbsp;snowy &nbsp;country roads in England with my son in tow and we 
have lots of fun and I have a calm mind knowing it is Awd. I believe many of 
these so called Audi owners are nothing more than goonies that are paid to 
create negative rumors and fear about Audi. It is a shame because they have 
always served my family well and the cars have become the new benchmark with 
many others trying to keep up. &nbsp;<br>

<p> Our first audi was a '98 A6 wagon with almost 170,000 miles on it. 
&nbsp;Awesome car, as solid as a tenk, and never a problem.<br>
Next was a 2001 
A6 wagon from Utah with only 114,000 miles on it. We put Eibach springs ans 
struts on it, and 17&quot; S6 5-spoke alloys. &nbsp;My wife LOVES that car. 
&nbsp;We drive it &gt;2000 miles back east each summer.<br>
I bought a 2000 A6 
2.7t 6-spd with 165,000 miles on it. Replaced the worn out front suspension, 
Eibach springs, Koni shocks.<br>
There is hardly any new car in a showroom that 
matches this car for luxury, performance, and understated elegance.<br>
<br>

HINT: Any problems with a new car will be handled before the warantee expires. 
&nbsp;Buy a Benz or Audi that's 5 years old and you can find one under $10k. 
&nbsp;These cars are built to last 400-500,000 miles and they will! &nbsp;<br>

<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>

SeaBreez: I am a 2008 TT owner also, a 2.0 Turbo roadster, and would not 
purchase anything but the<br>
S-tronic transmission. We have lots of traffic 
here in southern Florida and I just am smitten with the way this tranny 
performs... .2 second shifts up or down, RPM blipping, and a couple different 
shifting patterns with properly-placed paddles.<br>
<br>
I already flashed the 
ECU(APR)and added a Neuspeed cold air intake with a metallic Blitz filter. In 
the lighting department, I changed out the clear DRl's and put in amber bulbs 
and my fog lights are now HID. The car is now a rocket, especially in sport 
mode and on cooler days. The car gets 25 to 30 MPG and is a technical and 
design tour de force.<br>
<br>
My next upgrade will come shortly; a downpipe 
and catback GLH twin-tipped dual exhausts and a stage<br>
two ECU flash, good 
for another 25 HP. I leased the car as a project car and plan to do other 
upgrades to bring HP levels into the 325 to 350 range... easy to do on this 
engine.<br>
<br>
This is my third Audi. I had a 2002 A4, and the only problem 
was the faulty ignition coils, which was handled in fine style by my 
dealership, in conjunction with Audi.<br>
<br>
My second Audi is a 2006 A6 for 
the wife, with 38,000 miles on it and nary a problem in that time period.<br>

<br>My third is presently the TT, which I do not expect any problems with. <br>

<br>I do not know where all the negative comments are coming from about 
reliability, but as it stands now, with Audi experiencing a design and 
technical renaissance, I plan on staying with the marque<br>
for a long time. 
<br><br>
In closing, I would state that I have had some nice rides in the past, 
I'm 57 years young, and I never received the attention and positive unsolicited 
responses that the new TT garners from people of all ages and walks of life.<br>
<br>So all you detractors of the brand, put that in your bong and smoke it.<br>
