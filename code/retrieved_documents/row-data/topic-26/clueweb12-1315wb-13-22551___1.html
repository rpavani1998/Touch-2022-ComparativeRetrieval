Germany&#146;s Most Successful Premium Model in 2008&#149; After VW Golf, Audi 
A4 most frequently bought car in Germany &#149; Audi A6 and Audi TT most 
successful models in their classes &#149; Audi is the premium brand in Germany 
and Western Europe experiencing the strongest growth The latest vehicle 
registration numbers verify that the Audi A4 is Germany&#146;s most successful 
premium automobile. No other model in the premium segment surpassed the 98,714 
A4 models registered last year. The Audi A6 also topped its segment with 45,304 
registrations. The second generation of the Audi TT design icon was registered 
10,630 times in Germany &#150; making it the most successful sports car in 
Germany in 2008. AUDI AG was able to expand its market share on the domestic 
German market to 8.1 percent &#150; an increase of 0.8 percent. In Western 
Europe, Audi boosted its market share by 0.4 points to 4.8 percent: No other 
premium brand succeeded in strengthening its market position this 
significantly. &#147;Audi is presently experiencing stronger growth than any 
other premium brand in the region &#150; and thanks to new models we will 
maintain this dynamism,&#148; says Rupert Stadler, Chairman of the Board of 
Management of AUDI AG. &#147;In a difficult market environment, we want to 
further expand our market share in Germany and Western Europe.&#148; The Audi 
A4 is presently undergoing further upgrading: The top versions of the model 
line &#150; the S4 Sedan and Avant &#150; are now arriving in Europe&#146;s 
showrooms. The new A4 Avant was just launched in April 2008. In addition to the 
fleet award from Auto-Flotte magazine, Audi&#146;s best-selling model has 
already won countless accolades and has beaten the competition in all relevant 
comparison tests. The product improvement of the A6 was launched in September 
2008. Also the winner of the fleet award in its class, today the A6 is 
Germany&#146;s most successful business sedan. With the Audi TTS, the top 
version of the TT line, Audi introduced the first S model in this class. The 
Audi TT TDI debuted as the first production sports car powered by a diesel 
engine.
