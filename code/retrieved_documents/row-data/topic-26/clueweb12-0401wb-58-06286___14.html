From Ford</h1>

<p>Ford took the Detroit Auto Show as an opportunity to remind us of plans to 
dramatically differentiate theLincoln brand from Ford vehicles in both design 
andtechnology offerings.</p> 
<p>Lincoln has a number of new products in the pipeline to augment the mild 
success of the MKZ sedan and MKX crossover. In 2010, Lincoln sales were 3.6 
percent higher than in 2009.</p> 
<p>For 2011 and beyond, the plan is for more differentiation, and if Ford 
wants Lincoln dealers to pay for expensive dealership upgrades, that&rsquo;s 
probably a good idea.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The strategy isn&rsquo;t just new products, but full differentiation 
from the Ford brand in not only design, but intechnology,&rdquo; said Derrick 
Kuzak, Ford&rsquo;s group vice president of global product development, to<em>
Automotive News</em> and others at the Detroit Auto Show.</p> 
<p>Details such as an adjustable suspension system, different engines (a 
specially-tuned EcoBoost V-6, perhaps), and upgraded all-wheel drive could help 
establish Lincoln as definitively upscale in comparison with Ford. As with 
Acura, Lincoln doesn&rsquo;t intend to add a rear-wheel-drive vehicle in the 
near future.</p> 
<p>With Mercury gone, Ford may have more money (and attention) to devote to 
Lincoln. <strong>If you were in control of the brand, what changes would you 
make to Lincoln without putting a strain on Ford&rsquo;s finances?</strong></p>

<p>Ford, Mazda and Volvo shared platform of their cars, but each brands able 
to keep its differentiation. Ford also kept the latest technology for the 
jaguar and aston back then. Why not use that kind of management with Lincoln?
</p> 
<p>VW always put technology ahead in Audi before putting it VW 
models&hellip;Why not Ford do such game plan</p> <br>

<p>I think for american buyers this would be a great option, Look at the line 
up, add a more luxurious paint coat option, emblem treatment, special edition 
model like a olympic edition, bring back the presidential edition, maybe a 
sports enthusiast edition something like a billiard se with a pool cue and 
carrying case green felt stiching or something less bland. Similar to how the 
sporttrac and sporttrac adrenalin are the same vehicle with a minor extras</p>

<p>Own a 2010 MKT, and Love It!! Really would like to see Lincoln restored as 
the Premier Elegant Vehicle<br>
 Manufacturer in the USA market. How about a 
new Continental Mk IX?? Long, low, in both Glasstop and Convertible 4 door 
models, take the gorgeous 1939 Continental and bring it up to date. A return to 
Continental &ldquo;Trade Marks&rdquo; of rear fender skirts and fancy rear 
access Spare Tire would be a clear design identification of it&rsquo;s linage. 
I&rsquo;m a ready buyer and suspect there would be many 1000&prime;s of others!
<br> Get working on this Ford !! I don&rsquo;t want to buy a Government Motors 
anything!<br>

<p>Ford has bet that idea to death with concepts for the past 20 years 
(talking about the Continental). Ford was smart to abandon any notion of 
&lsquo;retro&rsquo; styling. The buyers with money want &ldquo;NEW and HIGH 
TECH&rdquo;. Only the rednecks and super old want retro (see Camaro / 
Mustang&hellip;and now I&rsquo;m not saying ALL Camaro / Mustang drivers are 
rednecks&hellip;but they are the ones boosting sales high enough to justify).
</p> 
<p>I hear the whole &ldquo;American&rdquo; them&hellip;but again&hellip;folks 
in that price catagory don&rsquo;t care. They are folks that work for global 
market companies, invest internationally, and reside in homes/condos, etc. with 
lots of international influence. I think folks with all that surrounding them 
would like to see the same in their vehicle. I actually think it would be cool 
for Ford to even have a flagship that is a kind of &lsquo;global&rsquo; model 
in the style department more than actual platform. But still would be very cool.

<p>I hope all of you that are making these comments about lincoln at least 
drove one or better yet even sat in one. I put my MKS up against any luxury 
vehicle (sold around the same price range) in America any day. I like the fact 
that I can use regular gas and have better techology then cars that cost double 
the price of my MKS. Lincoln can improve its product line just like all the 
other hundreds of car companies you are competing with these days but I think 
they are on the right track. It is harder to compete with the Ford line these 
days and I am sure that lincoln will follow. Keep up the good work Ford motor 
company.</p> <br>

<p>As many have mentioned, one of the big problems Lincoln has is the naming 
convention &ndash; MKX, MKT, MKS&hellip;I hear those letter configurations, but 
I can&rsquo;t picture the model they go on! They mean nothing. If it 
doesn&rsquo;t pop into one&rsquo;s head when heard, that is a real problem, 
especially for people that follow the auto industry as most posters here likely 
do. They need to really differentiate their models from Ford to make those 
names have meaning. And they seriously need a halo car.</p> <br>

<p>Lincolns are a joke. Hyundai and Kia are far more luxurious than Lincolns 
these days! Better style, equal tech, sportier cars, and &hellip;..wait for 
it&hellip;&hellip;..wait for it&hellip;&hellip;..RWD!!! All this at half the 
cost. Who does Ford think they are? Sad.</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> Asura Posted on: January 14, 2011&nbsp;3:57 am Reply <br>

<p>I find it funny on how everyone seems to be intent on RWD. The funny thing 
is, most of the consumer population doesn&rsquo;t car about RWD, nor do they 
realize when they are driving one (Case in point: I know MT did an article on 
BMW about the 1 series and being thought of as a FWD). The only thing people 
would be interested is if it had AWD, especially for those living in the north. 
As far as luxury quotient goes, why upgrade engine sizes when all of the 
germans are downgrading engine sizes?</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln is just a very tired brand. There&rsquo;s nothing exciting about 
the brand. Just look at Cadillac&hellip;though I think their designs are 
bordering on garish, they&rsquo;ve made an unbelievable splash in the lux car 
segment. Take a look at a CTS sitting next to a MKZ. Which would you pick? If 
you&rsquo;re under the age of 65 and haven&rsquo;t lost your marbles, 
you&rsquo;ll go with the CTS. In many ways, I think the Ford counterparts of 
Lincoln vehicles actually look better and more upscale. Their designs need a 
complete overhaul. Chrome wheels and grilles can&rsquo;t cure ugly, and in my 
opinion, they make a plain design look even cheaper, not more upscale.</p> <br>

<p>Ford&rsquo;s finances NEED to be strained to make Lincoln a viable brand. 
Complete reinvention is needed. That&rsquo;s why so many dealers are refusing 
to accept Ford&rsquo;s showroom plan for Lincoln. The network still has no 
faith in Ford&rsquo;s revival plan. If they can&rsquo;t build enthusiasm with 
the dealers&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>This is crap. Lincolns are crap.<br>
 I love Ford. I own Ford stock. I hate 
Lincoln.<br>
 They look like hell and don&rsquo;t have anything but decent 
interiors to back up the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; claim.<br>
 If Lincoln is going 
anywhere it&rsquo;s going to have to be through differentiation, and if they 
produce that hatchback thing I&rsquo;ve been seeing in concept photos then 
I&rsquo;ll puke. Right there and then</p> <br>

<li> Nick Posted on: January 13, 2011&nbsp;5:36 pm Reply <br>

<p>I think what they&rsquo;ve laid out is basically a good starting point but 
Lincoln desparately needs some sporty sedans. Strained finances or not its 
going to take at least a couple RWD/AWD sporty sedans to make Lincoln relevant. 
I wouldn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to come up with a platform 
architecture that could support a small sporty sedan and a midsizer as well as 
the next Mustang. They should Lincolnize the Mustang as well and sell it as the 
Mark IX. Make it quiet and more refined than the Mustang, load it up with 
technogoodies and have it compete with the MB SL class at a lower price point.

<p>As one who sells Lincoln vehicles I can say from personal experience that 
Lincoln customers want<br>
 something that sets them apart from Ford customers. 
So far Lincoln has really only done that with a higher price point but that is 
not enough. Point our the major differences between a fully loaded 2011 Ford 
Edge Limited AWD and a fully loaded 2011 Lincoln MKX. Aside from the name there 
is not much to set the Lincoln far ahead of the Ford.</p> 
<p>This has to change. Lincoln needs to make sure that if follows through on 
its promises to change and differentiate the brand from Ford. As someone 
already said on here if Lincoln wants to be truly successful and set itself far 
ahead it has to look to be a competitor to the likes of Audi and BMW in quality 
and engineering and not be afraid to take some pages from those companies play 
books!</p> 
<p>Just the opinion of one who hears what customers who buy these vehicles 
say&hellip;.and in the end isnt that why they are made, to please customer?</p>

<p>Good points, Sean. The brand, at the very least, models not part of the 
Ford lineup. (Wagon?) And a coupe and convertible at the very least. Even more 
extreme styling changes (especially the interior). And should receive new tech 
first, not Ford (and maybe have of its own special tech, like premium radio 
systems). Or special services (see Hyundai&rsquo;s Equus). Right now Ford and 
Lincoln are looking more like Honda/Acura than Toyota/Lexus or Nissan/Infiniti.

<p>I like the MKZ appearance as it is, although by all means freshen it. Give 
it adjustable suspension, with better handling (the goal should be Audi or BMW 
levels), and go absolutely nuts to make it quiet.<br>
 A key element of design 
(for any vehicle) should be that 2 hours should be the maximum amount of time 
it should take to repair or replace any part, including the engine, and 
especially anything behind the dash. This will get buy in from the service 
people and make them proud of the brand.<br>
 Give it more power (ecoboost V6, 
and ecoboost I-4) with the base line 4 giving about 250 horsepower and 
extremely good fuel economy at US turnpike speeds. Is 250 lbs torque at 1800 
rpm reasonable?</p> <br>

<p>Without putting a strain on Ford finances? Are you kidding, they are 
expecting their dealerships to invest (comparatively) huge sums of money on a 
promise. If they want to kick-start the Lincoln brand into relevance then it is 
going to take resources initially. They should perhaps follow VW in making them 
two totally separate entities &ndash; though I know that goes against the grain 
at Ford these days with a one world product philosophy which in Ford&rsquo;s 
case is a good thing. The two brands should never see each other products, 
sharing platforms is going to happen obviously but get them to produce their 
own models from the ground up if they are their own &lsquo;premium&rsquo; 
brand. Whatever it is, they are going to have to do something drastic to get 
the image of tarted up Fords out of peoples minds &ndash; I can think of no 
other brand that has their mass market and &lsquo;premium&rsquo; brand cars so 
closely mimicking each other. It also wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to have a calling 
card, a bit like Audi&rsquo;s Quattro, making all their models AWD &ndash; 
though it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that in particular. It sounds like they know 
this and that is their plan already so I just wish them luck in pulling it off.

<p>To revitalize the Lincoln Brand Ford with first need to &ldquo;Define a 
Style&rdquo; and build momentum at the major Autoshows. Just as Cadillac 
defined an &ldquo;Art and Science&rdquo; style with the CTS, ford will need to 
do the same. Ford will also need Lincoln to become more &ldquo;Youthful&rdquo; 
in terms of brand culture. NOONE IS OLD AT HEART, not even people who are 90 so 
don&rsquo;t design a brand to appeal to the higher end buyers parents design it 
to appeal to them and there very much alive sence of mystique, excitement and 
cutting edge/next step vibe. Next NAME YOUR MODELS, don&rsquo;t blend in with 
the other brands with this MKZ, CTS Q27i, toaster oven model number boredom. 
Names like CONVERJ, and EVOQ mean something and define the soul of your new car 
design. Now borrow a little swagger from Apple Stores and make Lincoln 
showrooms a jewel and not a Smoke Smelling, built in the 1960&prime;s, used to 
be a Mercury dealership experience. Make the customer feel like they are in the 
presence of a great automobile culture.</p> <br>

<p>Lincolns should be classy and distinguished. Dashes of sportiness but never 
at the expense of seeming immature or beneath their station. A lincoln should 
emit confidence and class and be unmistakable. It should be luxurious, and part 
of being a legitimate luxury brand means having a halo vehicle and a coupe of 
some kind.</p> 
<p>Lincolns should have names. Legendary, celebrated names. None of this Mk- 
alphabet soup that nobody can remember.</p> <br>

<p>FoMoCo needs a new pickup in the mid-size/compact range. They could also 
bring back<br>
 the Continental as the flagship to replace the Town Car, and a 
new lux-coupe. Bring the<br>
 Maverick back, as a smaller version of the 
Mustang, and bring back at least one 2-door<br>
 suv or introduce a 2-door cuv.

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t disagree more with the pickup comment. That is the last 
thing a &lsquo;premium&rsquo; car maker needs, does MB have one, BMW, Infiniti, 
no &ndash; and for good reason. In peoples minds, you make a pickup and you are 
appealing to the working guy/gal. It may not sound nice to say it, but part of 
a upmarket brand is buying into an image or snobby factor if you will. A pickup 
truck is about as far away as you can get from that image. They could get away 
with introducing one because of the iconic American view of pickups once they 
are at the top of the heap, say if they were looked at in the same light as BMW 
(or whatever brand you consider one of the leaders of the segment), but not 
anytime in the near future.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about a Lincoln pickup, as the 2 that they had 
failed. I&rsquo;m referring<br>
 to Ford having a small to mid-size domestic

<p>In the 70s&hellip;.it REALLY meant something if you drove a Mark V or a 
Continental. But then something happened. It became easier and more cost 
effective for car companies to badge engineer rather to design a car from the 
bottom up. (I&rsquo;m not saying that the Mark and the Thunderbird didn&rsquo;t 
share the same genes) I am saying that in that era, Cadillac and Lincoln MEANT 
SOMETHING. Maybe because it was before we were inundated with luxury brands 
from overseas. Lincoln needs to look at its roots to find its future. You 
don&rsquo;t drive a Lincoln MKZ because you want a chromed out 
Fusion&hellip;.you drive a Lincoln because YOU CAN. Because you have attained 
that level of financial comfort, that you want to go out and do something nice 
for yourself and award yourself for all your hard work. But Lincoln needs to 
consider that in order to get back to those roots, they need to offer a vehicle 
that offers something no other import brand does. That vehicle needs to be 
exclusive in the eyes of the lucky ones that purchase it. Start with 
design&hellip;..the rest will fall into place. Electronic gizmos don&rsquo;t 
sell cars. Design and quality sells cars.</p> <br>

<p>If Lincoln expects to compete with ANY of its so called peers such as Caddy 
and Merc etc, then who -is responsible for the brand needs to get their head 
ootb and observe the competition. Lincoln first of all needs a Flag Ship with 
rear wheel and all wheel drive. They also need a modern up to date V8. V6 is ok 
for the lower food chain Lincolns but not the top dog. Some sort of HALO car is 
necessary for them and a revival of a modern Continental Mark coupe (WITHOUT 
the continental kit trunk lid please) should be considered. This car would be 
V8, have all the most uptodate technology and exude refinement, reliability and 
be rear wheel drive also (or 4 wheel drive). The current big Lincoln (MKS 
isit?) is not a bad looking car but needs its butt out of the air and it should 
have a more road worthy stance. In 1959 or 60 Robert McNamara was President (I 
believe) of FOMOCO and it was his premise that Lincoln couldn&rsquo;t compete 
and should be dropped from the lineup. Elwood Engle and others convinced him 
&ldquo;one more&rdquo; chance and produced the fabulous 1961 Lincoln 
Continental which basically put them back on the map and made Lincoln a force 
to be recognized in the automotive world. The type of thinking, ability and 
creativity that made a 4 door Lincoln out of what was suppose to be the 1961 
TBird is what Lincoln Division needs today. I don&rsquo;t think they can just 
survive or compete, they need to dominate or they will die. The field is too 
crowded for any other option.</p> <br>

<p>Says who? Lincoln is not even in Audi&rsquo;s league, so we will disregard 
that comparison. As for Acura, they&rsquo;ve already gobbled up the 
marketshare, of consumers seeking near luxury regardless of drive wheels. 
Lincoln would have to directly compete with Acura. Think of it this way. If Jay 
Leno did his &ldquo;Jay-walking&rdquo; segment and asked random people on the 
streets to name 5 car manufacturers off the top of there head, how many do you 
think will name Lincoln? I honestly think that if ford killed of Lincoln, no 
one would really care. Lincoln needs to go the route of Hyundai and offer 
bang-for-your-buck. That means RWD, and available V-8 for the top tier 
vehicles. Lincoln is just being stubborn and imposing their philosophy on the 
consumers-but the consumers are not having it. Ford has plenty of engines to 
choose from. Lincoln needs to get it together.</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln needs to make AWD and 4 and 6 cylinder ecoboost engines its calling 
card. RWD plus longitudinal engines means excessive weight. With standard AWD 
and ecoboost engines they will be competing with Audi instead of Acura. With 
RWD and V-8&prime;s they are just leather lined Mustangs and Crown Vics.</p>

<p>First off make sure at the redesign all models do not look like a ford in 
any way. Step two bring back the continental name plate and make the mark 
series a big s class fighting sedan and a four door convertible flag ship. Step 
three introuduce a small city car in the 140 -175 inch range. that is what I 
would do.</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln needs some major work Ford. Don&rsquo;t just rebadge the Fords like 
you did with Merc. Make Lincoln a whole different line. Also, put names on the 
cars, not letters. MKZ, MKT, MKR, C3PO, R2D2.NO-NO-NO-NO-NO!!!! Zephyr, 
Navigator, Town Car, Cosmopolitan(51), Premier(57)etc.</p> <br>

<p>Agree 100% with getting rid of the letter monikers. Give the vehicles names 
again.</p> 
<p>On the vehicle front, make some plug-in hybrid and EV variants to sell with 
decent profit margins to cover developement expenses.</p> <br>

<p>Can anyone please name a lux auto brand that uses names (besides sports 
cars)? Acura, Lexus, Audi, BMW, MB, Jag, Caddy, all use letters rather then 
names. Names make a lux brand look cheap in the eyes of current high end 
purchasers. Zephyr&hellip;I mean seriously, I laughed when they tried to revive 
that name. They need to stop with the cheap looking cliche things (like when 
they were trying with the retro interiors&hellip;YUCK!), and pay more attention 
to styling (aka, huge steering wheels containing a giant airbag foot print 
shared with ford brands have to go, should not even be in fords!). They need to 
really look at competitors and the market. If they design the cars for 60-80 
year olds that is the only market they will get, and that market is one that is 
dying quick. They need to be more detailed oriented and remember the market 
they are courting and the amount of money they are asking buyers to spend. 
Lincoln needs to remember they must reinvent themselves, and not merely 
re-badge themselves as they always do. That division needs to get their heads 
in the game and really design their cars (inside and out) around the people 
purchasing in that category, or dump the line all together.</p> <br>

<p>Why is Ford abandoning the rear drive platform? As an avid Ford man I just 
don&rsquo;t get it. Front wheel drive for the most part is a turn off to me. 
Ford should bring back the Town Car and Crown Victoria. These are very 
respected nameplates AND very solid cars. Although the platform is dated, 
it&rsquo;s somewhat modern. A nip here and a tuck there these cars could be 
best sellers in their segment. I&rsquo;m 38 years old and have owned and 
currently drive the Lincoln Town Car. Ford needs to call me and give me an 
opportunity to work on these two cars and I GUARANTEE they would sell!!!</p>

<p>I think it would do Lincoln a world of wonder to release a 2 door RWD coupe 
based on the Mustang with a 4 wheel independant suspension and Aluminum Chassis 
parts to seperate it from the Mustang. I dont think they should make it a 2 
seater I think it should be a 4 seater with a soft top convertable option. Im 
sure if they did that and gave it an &ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; Eco boast V6 with 
one of those 6 speed trannies not only would it stur life back into the long 
forgoten &ldquo;Hot Rod Linclon&rdquo; idea but get more people into Linclon 
show rooms. And as a Topper they could actually call it the Mark X like the 
concept shown in 2003 that was a great looking car but was never produced.</p>

<p>If I were Ford I would engineer two all new worldwide RWD platforms that 
are adjustable to create small sporty cars and small RWD sedans to a Town Car/ 
Crown Vic replacement. Smaller platorm for small fuel efficient sporty car 
going up to Mustang size. Use the for a Miata type car for NA and Europe, 3 
series fighter for lincoln, a new Mark VIII sport coupe with serious sporting 
pretentions. Many of these vehicles could be sent to Austrailia and used to 
make smaller RWD cars in Austrailia as well. The Larger platform could be used 
for a Town Car replacement. Going down to a new Continental supreme luxury 
sedan and then creating a CTS fiighter as well. You could spread this platform 
worldwide, sending a new Crown Victoria to not only here but China as well. 
Make a Ford Large sporty sedan used to be then new P.I.</p> 
<p>With this many cars in that many markets the cost of the platform would be 
less and would be paid off faster then is just for one market and one car. Also 
would give Lincoln very unique vehicles in the Ford Portfolio, make the dealers 
happy and give consumers a real reason to return to Lincoln Dealers.</p> <br>

<p>THAT TROLL IS BACK AGAIN??? PUH-LEASE!!!</p> 
<p>Minus, you don&rsquo;t understand vehicle buyers preferences (what they 
will and won&rsquo;t buy, for you my CHILD, to understand&hellip;):<br>
 * 
Coup&eacute;s and convertibles tend NOT TO SELL WELL, even in luxury brands, 
and they have to be brought with caution; a two-seater next-gen Mustang-based 
coup&eacute;-convertible (let the 4-seater for the Mustang), replacement to the 
last gen T-Bird might do some Lincoln sales (and it&rsquo;d be basd on a 
then-existing platform to justify [$$] it).<br>
 * Lincoln has tried light 
pickups before (Blackwood, MK-LT) and FAILED (only could find takers in MX), so 
NO Lincoln version of Raptor.<br>
 * Lincoln and both SPORTS CAR and MUSCLE CAR 
DON&rsquo;T MIX, so don&rsquo;t make them be anything that they aren&rsquo;t (a 
defined image is so important for ANY car brand, more so for luxo-brands).<br>
 
* A RWD larger sed&aacute;n (can be smaller than a Town Car, but not much) is 
needed to mantain a beach-head in certain industries 
(limo/taxi/hearse&hellip;), as long as it has the latest large car engine, 
suspension and tranny technology.<br>
 * Give the GREEN LIGHT to build the 
production version of the MK-R (might get another name) mid-size RWD 
sed&aacute;n (next-gen Mustang-based, also to spawn the next-gen OZ Falcon and 
needed for the coup&eacute;-convertible I mentioned above).</p> <br>

<p>I can honestly say if Lincoln actually styles a different looking car than 
a Ford rather than just grafting on a new nose and tail, I might actually 
consider one. I just want a Continental with AWD (closest I&rsquo;ll get to 
RWD) and the suicide doors.</p> <br>

<p>lincoln should tap into ford of Australia&rsquo;s rwd platforms for a new 
continental to replace the mks. i would stay away from the ancient I-6 they use 
and use the ecoboost v6 and turbo a downsized (4.4 or so) version of the coyote 
5.0. keep the mkz fwd/awd. revive the mark coupe using the mustang platform 
with multilink rear suspension and 7 or 8 speed auto or 6 speed manny for the 
LSC version, this should be v8 only. upgrade the navigator&rsquo;s powertrain. 
down the line a fullsize competitor to the 7 series and s class.</p> <br>

<p>I read a-lot of chatter on this website about the necessity of RWD, like 
redvette77 just mentioned</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I have no earthly idea why that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea 
to them. No RWD in their future. Come on Lincoln, you guys should be smarter 
than that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>While I have yet to hear once from any one I&rsquo;ve talked to about cars 
outside of this website about their preference for RWD. It seems like most 
don&rsquo;t care if its Front wheel drive or RWD but they do seem to care if 
its AWD.</p> <br>

<p>Another PR stunt that Crain&rsquo;s &ldquo;reporters&rdquo; SLIPPED worse 
that with that gooey stuff (the one that a full-size van couldn&rsquo;t go 
through it&hellip;) that appeared on a &ldquo;Modern Marvels&rdquo; doc-show, 
SHEESH!</p> 
<p>We want FACTS AND FIGURES, not FLUFF!!!</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s another thread here on MT&rsquo;s forums (from a better 
source) that rumored that two different-size EcoBoosted (T-GDI or 2T-GDI for 
the uniciated) engines might roll first: a 2.2L I4 (most likely for the 
production version of the MK-C Focus-based sed&aacute;n, a larger version 
engine of the 2.0L other F products will get) and a 2.7L V6 (brand-new size in 
this era, F doesn&rsquo;t offer in NoAm any 6 below 3.0L).</p> 
<p>Also, there are rumors of (finally) replacing the MK-? alphanumerical 
system of naming models for good old-fashinoned names: the MK-S might become 
the Continental and the MK-Z might revert back to the Zephyr, for 
example&hellip;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of info we need, OK?</p> <br>

<p>They need a car to represent. Ford Falcon would be perfect. All the Lux 
brands have a sporty offerings, except Lincoln ( MKS Ecoboost doesnt look 
sporty at all )</p> <br>

<li> AutoMax Posted on: January 13, 2011&nbsp;10:16 am Reply <br>

<p>LOL!!! </p> 
<p>AutoMax says make rear wheel drive or buy big crane and knock down Lincoln 
dealers as they are a waste of space with no rear wheel drive models. </p> 
<p>Ford needs MyFord Touch in all models by 2012 and Lincoln style Raptor and 
Cobra with independent rear suspension!!! </p> 
<p>Also bring back the Ford GT perhaps in Lincoln form because that would look 
HOT!!! </p> 
<p>AutoMax, the only one left who knows how to save the auto industry!!! </p> 
<p>Also a smaller vehicle to compete with Jeep would be nice, just make a 
Raptor without the box, that would be small enough with some 40 inch tires and 
we&rsquo;d have a Jeep killer!!! </p> 
<p>Also a hardtop convertible rear wheel drive muscle car is a must!!! </p> 
<p>Ford needs to get it together NOW or AutoMax will be commenting on the next 
WOT article that says Ford is no longer in business!!! </p> <br>

<p>I would produce an old-fashioned, RWD sedan that can fit 5 adults 
comfortably.</p> 
<p>I have no earthly idea why that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea to 
them. No RWD in their future. Come on Lincoln, you guys should be smarter than 
that.</p> <br>
