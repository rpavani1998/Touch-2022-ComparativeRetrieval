<blockquote> 
<p> <b>Introduction:</b> </p> 
<p> Any BMW wearing a &quot;3&quot; badge has a lot of expectations to meet. 
As the quintessential entry-level luxury car, the 3 Series defines the 
category. The 3's SUV equivalent, however, the 2009 BMW X3, makes the family 
proud. Its sporty handling and steering, powerful engine, added utility and 
fun-to-drive nature are all BMW hallmarks. The X3 also fulfills the brand's 
reputation for modern luxury with a long list of conveniences, exquisite 
comfort, premium interior materials and near-flawless build quality. Add to 
that the X3's generous seating space (even for taller adults) and spacious 
cargo area, and you have an accomplished crossover SUV that's well suited for 
the chores of daily life as well as twisty roads. This isn't to say that the X3 
is faultless. One by-product of the superb handling is a less-than-luxurious 
ride quality. For those who prefer something softer, something like a Lexus RX 
350 would likely work out better. The added features and prestige of the BMW 
brand also make the X3 more expensive than similarly sporty entry-level luxury 
SUVs like the Infiniti EX35 and Acura RDX. There are also a couple new choices 
to consider this year: the Audi Q5 and the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class, both of 
which follow the same entry-level luxury SUV formula. Overall, however, the 
2009 BMW X3 remains one of our favorites, and it's certainly a top pick for 
anyone hoping for more driving pleasure from an SUV.</p> 
<p> <b>Body Styles, Trim Levels and Options:</b> </p> 
<p> The 2009 BMW X3 is a small luxury crossover SUV that is offered in one 
trim level, the xDrive30i. Included as standard features are 17-inch alloy 
wheels, a panoramic sunroof, automatic headlights, heated side mirrors, 
automatic climate control, leatherette (premium vinyl) upholstery, a 
leather-wrapped steering wheel, eight-way-adjustable power front seats with 
driver memory settings, full power accessories, keyless entry and a 10-speaker 
CD/MP3 player with an auxiliary audio jack. Options are largely grouped into 
packages. The sport activity package includes 18-inch wheels, running boards, a 
sport steering wheel and rear privacy glass. The premium package includes 
leather upholstery, auto-dimming mirrors, ambient lighting and Bluetooth. This 
package can also be had with upgraded 16-way power front seats. A cold weather 
package includes heated front and rear seats. Finally, there's the sport 
package, which comes with a stiffer sport suspension, sport front seats and 
steering wheel, and body styling accents. Stand-alone options are also 
available and include 19-inch alloy wheels with higher-performance tires, a 
premium audio system, HD radio, a navigation system, a heated steering wheel, 
adaptive xenon headlights and front and rear parking sensors.</p> 
<p> <b>Powertrains and Performance:</b> </p> 
<p> Powering the BMW X3 xDrive30i is a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine that produces 
260 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. Power is routed through either a 
six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission with manual shift 
control. All-wheel drive is standard. In our testing, we managed to accelerate 
a manual-transmission X3 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds. EPA estimated fuel ratings 
for the automatic transmission are 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 20 mpg in 
combined driving. The manual transmission comes in at 1 fewer mpg across the 
board.</p> 
<p> <b>Safety:</b> </p> 
<p> Standard safety equipment for the X3 includes antilock disc brakes, 
automatic brake drying, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain 
airbags, active front-seat head restraints, stability control and hill descent 
control. Rear-seat side airbags are available as an option. In crash testing 
conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the X3 was awarded the 
highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; for protection in both frontal offset and 
side impacts.</p> 
<p> <b>Interior Design and Special Features:</b> </p> 
<p> The 2009 X3's interior is attractive and fitted with top-notch materials. 
The front seats are comfortable and firm, with sufficient support for sporty 
driving. One annoyance is that the controls for the ventilation, audio and 
optional navigation can be fussy to operate. You might also be surprised that a 
rear entertainment system isn't available as a factory option. Rear storage 
offers up 30 cubic feet of space, and with the 60/40-split rear seats stowed, 
capacity is upped to a roomy 71 cubes.</p> 
<p> <b>Driving Impressions:</b> </p> 
<p> The 2009 BMW X3 xDrive30i excels when it comes to handling. Among small 
luxury crossover SUVs, the X3 has no equal when it comes to arcing along a 
curvy road, thanks to the superior steering feel, ideal suspension tuning and 
eager engine power output. However, if what you're looking for is a family 
vehicle to haul the clan cross-country in maximum comfort, the X3's sometimes 
stiff ride quality is a detriment. The X3's straight-6 delivers spirited power 
over the majority of its rpm range, while the automatic transmission's 
gearchanges are caffeinated in their eagerness.</p> </blockquote>
