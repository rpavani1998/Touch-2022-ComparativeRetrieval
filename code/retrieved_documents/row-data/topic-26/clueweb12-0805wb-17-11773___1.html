<h3>2010 Audi A3 </h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4> 
<p>2010 Audi A3 </p> 
<p>The Audi A3 is a compact, yet premium car with excellent driving dynamics 
from superbly engineered powertrain, suspension and braking systems. It's also 
quite stylish and luxurious, particularly for a car in its market category. 
Yet, it's also fuel-efficient and represents a great value for the money. It's 
so good, and so appropriate for a world that increasingly requires efficiency 
and long-term satisfaction, that it is one of that group of vehicles we think 
of as keepers.</p> 
<p>The A3 is a practical, compact five-door hatchback, but it feels up-market, 
like a scaled-down A4. We like the A3 for its combination of open-road 
dynamism, long-haul friendliness, and around-town usefulness. The A3 is an 
example of the exquisite sensibilities in design and use of materials that 
distinguishes a contemporary Audi.</p> 
<p>Two powertrains are available. The A3 2.0 TFSI is powered by a turbocharged 
2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, rated at 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of 
torque, which drives either the front wheels, or has all-wheel-drive with the 
quattro version. With front-wheel drive it is available with either a six-speed 
manual transmission or a six-speed automatic S tronic dual-clutch transmission 
(DSG) with electro-hydraulic control; in quattro form it is available only with 
the S tronic. With the manual transmission this engine is EPA-rated at 21 mpg 
City, 30 mpg Highway.</p> 
<p>New for 2010 is the 2.0 TDI clean diesel that makes 140 horsepower and 236 
pound-feet of torque. It is available only with front-wheel drive and the S 
tronic automatic transmission. With all that torque it has no problem at all 
moving the A3 down the road or up the hills, even with it fully loaded. Perhaps 
most significantly, it is EPA-rated at 30 mpg City and a remarkable 42 mpg 
Highway.</p> 
<p>Other changes for 2010 include the S line exterior being made standard, a 
Titanium Sport Package added as an option (it includes titanium-optic wheels, 
black grille, sport suspension and seats, and leather/alcantara upholstery), 
bi-xenon headlights standard on the Premium Plus model, the navigation now 
includes traffic data, and wood interior trim is available as an option. The 
Audi Magnetic Ride and the 3.2-liter V6 engine have been discontinued.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>We found the A3 models offer superb balance and excellent throttle response 
that make for a convincing sports-car experience when the road is right. 
Inside, the A3 is roomy and versatile, blending pleasing materials with logical 
controls and highly legible readouts.</p> 
<h4>Model Lineup</h4> 
<p>The 2010 Audi A3 2.0 TFSI ($27,270), 2.0 TFSI DSG ($28,750), and 2.0 TFSI 
DSG quattro ($30,850) come with leather upholstery; automatic climate control 
with pollen filter and sun sensor; power lumbar support; tilt and telescoping 
steering column; 10-speaker, 140-watt stereo; central locking with remote 
keyless entry; power windows; electronic cruise control; anti-theft alarm; two 
cupholders in the center console; vanity mirrors in the sunvisors; Servotronic 
electro-mechanical steering; and 17-inch, five-spoke alloy wheels with 
all-season radial tires.</p> 
<p>The A3 2.0 TDI diesel ($29,950) is equipped as the gasoline-engine models, 
and is available with the same options.</p> 
<p>The Premium Plus Package ($2,000) adds 17-inch, ten-spoke alloy wheels, a 
storage package, illumination package, power front driver's seat with four-way 
power lumbar adjustment, multifunction three-spoke sport steering wheel, alloy 
shift paddles on cars with DSG, HID headlamps, and Bluetooth. The Convenience 
Package ($1,000) adds Bose Premium sound, rain-sensing wipers, and an 
auto-dimming mirror with compass.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Options include a Cold Weather Package ($500) with heated front seats, 
heated windshield washer nozzles and heated exterior mirrors; navigation 
($2,000), which includes a six-cd changer and two SD card slots; and the 
moonroof ($1,100).</p> 
<p>Safety features that come standard on all models include front and 
side-impact airbags for the front-seat passengers. All five seating positions 
get three-point seatbelts and adjustable headrests, while front-seat headrests 
feature active technology to reduce whiplash injuries. The front seat belts 
feature height adjustment, automatic pre-tensioners and belt-force limiters. 
Rear side airbags are optional ($350). Active safety features that come 
standard include electronic stability program (ESP); full-time traction control 
(ASR); ABS, EBD, Brake Assist; and an electronic differential lock (EDL).</p>
