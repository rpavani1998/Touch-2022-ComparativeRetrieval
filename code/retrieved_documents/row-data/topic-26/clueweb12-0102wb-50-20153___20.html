<p>Car owners tend to fall into two camps: Life-long loyalists, and fickle 
dilettantes that flit from brand to brand chasing the latest trend or hot 
model. Forum member<strong>westys</strong> wants to know if based on the 
experience with your current vehicle, if you would buy another from the same 
brand. An admitted VW loyalist, westys looks forward to buying aJetta TDI 
Sportwagen.</p> 
<p>Others commenting on the thread have mixed ownership experiences. For some, 
their favorite brand is discontinued. Some prefer not to limit themselves, and 
take advantage of the variety of new models on the marketplace. Others have 
strict guidelines and conditions for their purchase consideration, such as 
available engines and transmissions (i.e. six-cylinder, manual transmission 
only), while others are dictated by practical needs (growing family, 
occupation.)</p> 
<p>What do you drive now, and based on your experience with it, would you buy 
another from the same brand? Share your thoughts and experiences on
today&rsquo;s Thread of the Day!</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;ve found myself in Chrysler vehicles more times than not, 
but that is spread over Dodge, Chrysler, and Jeep. But I&rsquo;ve also owned 
Ford, Toyota, VW, Subaru, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and even Triumph.</p> 
<p>I am not brand loyal. Most cars, especially now are up to a standard that 
will surpass anything from 10 years previous to that model year. I rarely buy 
new, so it&rsquo;s more of a matter of find a great price. I often take 
advantage of auto and insurance auctions. I often buy when I find a good deal, 
rather than wait for a need and forced to over pay. Brand loyalty is for the 
birds. If you are so wrapped up and convinced that a &ldquo;brand&rdquo; is 
better than another, you are sorely mistaken. Mostly it is a matter of 
subjective preferences and great advertising on part of the manufacturer.</p>

<p>I currently have a 2011 Mazda 2 GX and its an ok car. I have had a few 
little minor issues with it and I don&rsquo;t think the car is all that it is 
cracked up to be. I probably won&rsquo;t buy another Mazda. I had a 2010 
Hyundai Accent 3dr before the Mazda and that was a great car. I will probably 
go back to Hyundai after.</p> <br>

<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m really big into cars. My whole family is. My Uncle is a 
true car lover. He had a 2008 Audi S8, 2008 Audi RS4, 2007 Audi A8L W12, and a 
2008 Audi A4 S-line. every single one is just a whole different world then the 
other. We have a 2003 Audi A6 Quattro, a 2010 VW Jetta TDi, and a 2012 VW 
Touareg. We honestly love cars. VW&rsquo;s are such great cars. They are very 
reliable and good quality. The A6 is like new. It does cost some money to keep 
it running to Audi specs, but the thrill and quality can be priced. The Audi 
company has came a long way and has progressed very well. The VW company is 
amazing. For those of you who havent considered a Volkswagen, please give them 
a chance. especially the new passat. It would help the economy being made in 
America. Overall, yes I will be a VW/Audi customer for life! Well worth the 
money!</p> <br>

<p>My &rsquo;98 integra is approaching 300,000KM and hasn&rsquo;t missed a 
beat. Now that I&rsquo;m actually making some decent money I&rsquo;m thinking 
about getting something new, but I def. won&rsquo;t buy a new acura; the 
company that made my car just isn&rsquo;t the same anymore. Thinking about a 
lightly used g37 but unfortunately there&rsquo;s only one infiniti dealer in my 
city and it has a terrible reputation for service. I might just keep the 
integra as a winter car and get a mustang gt for summer. Decisions&hellip;.</p>

<p>i am currently driving a vw gti (2010) and i would absolutely purchase 
another vw based on my experience thus far. with that said, provided a car is 
available with a manual transmission and has a certain &ldquo;fun to 
drive&rdquo; quality it will be on my short list regardless of brand. i do tend 
to favor euro styling and design (although i&rsquo;ve owned brands from around 
the world) so i would probably look at those brands first over other brands.</p>

<p>Ive owned </p> 
<p>97 Dodge Neon- Yes, never a problem and a lot of family have Chrysler Co 
cars and all but one have not had problems, the one that did was a Caliber</p> 
<p>85,87,87 SS Monte Carlo,03 Cavalier, 97 Suburban- The Only real problems 
was the interior of the cavy, and suburban being cheap and falling apart though 
GM&rsquo;s newer products dont seem to be too cheap lol so yes</p> 
<p>97 F-150,05 Ranger,09 Fusion-YES. the f-150 is at 220,xxx on the ORIGINAL 
clutch with nothing but basic maintenance. I just bought the Ranger and despite 
it being a ranger(DATED EVERYTHING LOL) no problems for the 10,000+ miles Ive 
owned it. the Fusion has been nothing but solid also</p> 
<p>89 Mazda B2200- First truck and I got it in 07 so I cant really judge mazda 
on it but that thing took a beating and never left me stranded lol though I do 
like Mazda a lot now lol so yea</p> <br>

<p>Almost a surprise to me has been the PT Cruiser and Dodge Neon. It seems 
they are near rock solid up through until around 170,000 miles. I see many 
before that of course, because they are wrecked, but most of them are never 
beyond that mark without significant wear (and nearly useless to me since I 
don&rsquo;t do scrap). I did run across a Neon of the 2000-2002 that had 
260,000+/- miles (I don&rsquo;t remember exactly and it was too dark to get a 
picture). I never expected those two (which share a ton of parts) to last that 
long in such decent mechanical shape and generally visually good too.</p> <br>

<p>Hell no! I have a jeep patriot and i can&rsquo;t stand it! It has so much

a great price so i guess I got what I paid for.</p> <br>

<p>Patriots (aka Dodge Nitro) was one of the worst models. Stick with a 
Wrangler, Liberty, G. Cherokee for Jeep. Those are good to great cars.</p> <br>

<p>Nope. I currently have a 2008 Infiniti G35x, and I have two major issues 
with it: fuel economy (averages around 20mpg even with significant highway 
miles) and a miserable AWD system. I will be switching to either Audi (new A3), 
Cadillac (ATS), or back to BMW (I had a new 3 series before the Infiniti).</p>

<p>Audis are nice and of course have a great awd system, but you&rsquo;re 
likely to have a ton of reliability issues. I&rsquo;d go with caddy or bimmer

<p>Im sorry to say this but my family has audis forever. They are just 
phenomenal. There is no other car like them. Also they have very good 
reliability. My dad has a 2003 Audi A6 Quattro and its still looks and drives 
new. I think you would be much more satisfied with an Audi compared to a BMW. 
My dad has had two of those also and he always had problems with them. My 
choice~ I&rsquo;d go Audi all the way!</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;d go with neither audi or bmw. Personal experience aside, just look 
at the statistics. Both have far less than stellar reliability. They might be 
fun to drive, but what good is it if the car is always in the shop?I learned 
the hard way: Despite religiously following the maintenance schedule for my 
2006 A4 2.0t, it eventually had engine sludge issues and all kinds of 
electrical sh*t going on. Never again</p> <br>

<p>Funny the car mentioned in the topic is a Sportwagen TDI&hellip; I just got 
rid of mine after two years of aggravation. Google VW HPFP &ndash; the problem 
is not being exaggerated. I thought it was and bought one anyway. Mine was in 
the shop for airbag sensors, flywheel vibration, then twicw for the HPFP. Yes, 
it&rsquo;s covered under warranty, but be prepared to battle VW who will likely 
try to blame bad fuel. Like I said google it&hellip;<br>
 NEVER AGAIN VW!!</p>

<p>Ok, I totally understand you frustration man! But honestly, shit happens. 
Vw&rsquo;s are great cars. I got a 2010 Jetta TDI sedan and love it. It is such 
a fun car to drive and always turn heads. My dad recently purchased a 2012 
Touareg TDI. This car is amazing! The quality of the Touareg is that of a Audi 
or Porsche. My opinion, give VW&rsquo; another shot.</p> <br>

<p>Right now we have a Ford and a Chrysler. We love our Pacifica, and will 
almost certainly buy another Chrysler product to replace it, whatever that ends 
up being, unless we find something my wife likes better. The Ford is OK, but, 
my wife hates it. Will probably look elsewhere to replace that. Of course, all 
of this is contingent on me finding a decent paying job. Until that happens, 
we&rsquo;ll be driving what we have for quite a while.</p> <br>

<p>I have a 2009 Honda Accord and a 2008 Mazda CX-7. My wife and i have fallen 
in love with our CX-7. The Honda has been a great car but it was a little 
expensive in terms of what we got. The CX-7 is fully loaded with the Turbo and 
AWD. We are looking to replace the Honda and we are considering a new Regal, a 
new Charger (maybe) and a new MINI Countryman. We are just looking to get 
something with a little more to it as the Honda has rock solid reliability but 
it definitely lacks excitement. Unless the new 2013 Accord is awesome, which I 
doubt will happen with the introduction of the CVT. I am also really interested 
in the new Mazda 6 if its anything like they have said.</p> <br>

<li> 40 Rouge Posted on: February 10, 2012&nbsp;7:37 am Reply <br>

<p>Nah. Although I have loved each of my previous rides (Toyota, Mitsubishi, 
Volvo) for very different reasons, I will always look at every brand when 
considering the next purchase. If i&rsquo;m going to spend the hard earned 
money, I want to get something that works for me and excites me when I turn the 
key, and that can be any brand. Also, I would also consider the reputation of 
the local dealerships that I&rsquo;d have to deal with. I currently have a 
Volvo and the dealership in town recently changed ownership. The previous 
management was awesome to work with and was happy to help me modify my car. 
This new management gives me hard times about my modifications. Sad to say, but 
when I&rsquo;m buying my next car in a year, I&rsquo;m avoiding that 
dealership, even though the Volvo has been great to me.</p> <br>

<p>Well I got a Ford now and the last car I had before this one was also a 
Ford. But at this point I got the best Pony car for me and now I want a midsize 
coupe but no one really makes that but BMW. But knowing how hard it is to find 
work now adays I just have to go the used car route and I could careless about 
brands at that point.</p> <br>

<p>im on my third gm vehicle and very happy with their quality. Im thinking i 
want my next car to be a 84 or 85 pontiac fiero. apparently their engine 
compartments can hold a 7.0 v8 (according to the interwebs), how cool would 
that be, to mount a z06 engine into a mid-engine pontiac? those cars are way 
cheap too. i could get one with high milage (as long as theres no rust) for 
about 4k and the engine slightly used for the same.</p> <br>

<p>Currently own two BMWs (X3 and Z4 Coupe), both CPOs. Also owned a 2000 328i 
prior to these. Great cars, have not given any problems, but I would now own a 
BMW (or any luxury vehicle) without some type of warranty/maintenance package, 
the cost is just too much. And yes I would buy another BMW. I&rsquo;ve 
previously owned Audis (A4s and TT), Ford (Bronco and Tempo (remember those 
POS?)), and Mazda (two MX-6s). The Mazdas were good to me, Ford not so much, 
but it was a long time ago&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>I currently own a 2008 G35S, I recently moved back to the Northeast. I want 
my next car to be a coupe, AWD with manual transmission, I have been looking 
and my choices are Audi A5/S5 and BMW 3 series coupe when/if it comes out in 
2013. I wish the infiniti G coupe was AWD and manual, then I would definitely 
stick with Infiniti.</p> <br>

<p>I have owned two Hondas since January 2008. The first was a civic and I now 
have a 2011 CR-V. Both were purchased brand new. I also have friends that have 
really high mileage Hondas and they are bulletproof. I have no reason to look 
at anything else not only because of the quality in both vehicles but my 
dealership is excellent to deal with. I will shop around next time but in all 
likelihood I will stick with Honda. They are not the flashiest or fastest, but 
they do everything I need them to do. I would like something faster, obviously, 
but unless I am living in Germany, I will never see any vehicle reach its full 
potential.</p> <br>

<p>I own a 2009 Mini Cooper Clubman. I&rsquo;ve driven some great cars, 2008 
Audi RS4, 2002 M3, 2004 WRX STI, but there is something about the Mini that 
makes it the most enjoyable car I&rsquo;ve ever driven. It is the base model, 
no turbo, but it just does everything so well. I will without a doubt own a 
Mini for the rest of my life.</p> <br>

<p>Eugh, no. I have an &rsquo;02 EP3 Si and I miss the company that laid my 
golden egg. If the CR-Z had a K20, if the Si had a turbo, and if there 
weren&rsquo;t such a thing as a WRX, maybe I would have thought of another 
honda, but the CR-Z sucks, the Si is bland, and there is quite such a thing as 
a WRX.</p> <br>

<p>Family has owned many cars over my life. Our truck has been an 02&prime; 
f350 with the 7.3 powerstroke. Great truck, legendary motor. Many corrosion 
problems stemming from plowing dirt roads for 11 winters. Would stick with Ford 
for a truck purchase. Our cars have been an 04&prime; Nissan Armada, and 3 
Subarus. The Armada has been fantastic, all issues have been extremely minor 
and cosmetic, except exhaust manifold. The Subarus? They have been the best 
vehicles we&rsquo;ve ever owned. Our 01&prime; Forester L just died at 320,000 
miles. Other than usual maint, head gaskets, timing belts, axles, there 
haven&rsquo;t been any repairs. It died as a result of a tree falling on it 
btw. My vehicle was an 04&prime; Impreza Outback Sport with the automatic. I 
got it at 182,000 with the headgaskets already repaired. Drove it from 182k to 
210k with the only replacement being shocks and regular maint. The vehicle I 
drive now is an 11&prime; Impreza hatch base with the 5 speed manual. No issues 
so far other than some rattling in the interior plastics at the seams. 
Subaru&rsquo;s are well thought out, well laid out, and well built machines. 
Love them or hate them, drive one for any length of time, and hating them will 
be no easy task.</p> <br>

<p>Our 2010 Renault Scenic is the fifth I&rsquo;ve had in the last 14 years, 
and would definitely buy another, unless the competition came out with 
something better. Our 2001 Renault Clio is starting to show its age &ndash; my 
wife wants a 4th gen Clio when it comes out in the autumn, or the Zoe electric.

<p>I currently have a 2011 Dodge Challenger SE. I would buy another 
Challenger, but the next one I get would be an RT. I&rsquo;m pretty loyal to 
the Big Three and don&rsquo;t stray too much from that path. I did own a 
Hyundai once and while not bad, nothing they have really excites me outside the 
Genesis Coupe. Most of the cars that I&rsquo;ve owned have come from FoMoCo.</p>

<p>Have had a 4Runner 4wd v8 Sport for 6 yrs (bought new) without one issue, 
so I would recommend it, but currently they have nothing that excites me. My 
fun car is a BMW 135i M Sport Manual, and I really enjoy it. I&rsquo;ve only 
had it for a year, but have had no real issues so far (BMW did do a recall on 
the High Pressure Fuel Pump, but since it was covered the replacement 
didn&rsquo;t cost me) and am interested in another BMW down the road (as well 
as a Porsche). The wife drives an Infinity G35x Sport model sedan that we got 
as a CPO, she likes it and other than a few small issues (like the finish 
coming off some of the interior trip pieces too easily) it has been a good car 
for the last 3 yrs, we do like having the lengthy CPO warranty. When 
we&rsquo;re ready for her next vehicle we&rsquo;re thinking of a CPO BMW X3 
with the new turbo 4 and 8 speed auto, then I&rsquo;ll get rid of the Runner, 
as it will be much more fuel efficient, just as quick and more fun to drive. I 
also have two Ducatis and (even though some of their dealer&rsquo;s suck) would 
definitely buy within the brand again!</p> <br>

<p>I love my A4 Avant with an MT6 and would definitely buy again. 
Unfortunately Audi isn&rsquo;t giving me too many options on a direct 
replacement. Please bring the A5 Sportback! Seems like a logical choice since 
you no longer sell Avants in the US. Not everyone wants a CUV.</p> <br>

<p>I am considering a Hyundai Genesis (sedan) or Azera to replace my aging 
Santa Fe but I will look at Toyota (my previous maker of choice) and Infiniti 
(Nissan was a previous maker of choice but I hate their move to the CVT and a 
rental Altima I had was horrible). I may also look at Ford and maybe the Buick 
Regal GS (though I generally loath all GM products and have owned more than one 
horrible GM product). I love the idea of the new Passat and think it is a nice 
looking car but the short warranty and a history of problems makes my nervous.

<p>Absolutely not. Me and my wife currently own a CRV, we got it new and it 
has proved to be a solid well built machine and having 4wd has been great. 
However we got this vehicle because of budget restraints. I will gladly wait 
YEARS UPON YEARS to make sure we get the car we WANT not need. The CRV is not 
bad at all its just the most dull thing i have ever driven. My first car was a 
98 regal GS and I had to sell it shortly after I got married and I miss it. 
Nothing against Honda but I am neither old enough or boring enough to get one 
ever again</p> <br>

<p>My previous car was Acura and I will never own an Acura again!!! I just 
have no taste for them. My current car is Hyundai and NO I will not buy another 
Hyundai in the future. Owned a saab before, was ok and owned a Mitsubishi, was 
piece of TRASH. I will never buy Mitsubishi as well. Owned a Bmw 3 series and 6 
series and I loved them both even though they were high to maintain. My next 
car is gonna be a BMW 3 series Coupe, The current model But if the 2012 model 
handles great I might as well consider it because I want a bmw with less than 
15000 miles or brand new, must be 2011 and up as well. An Audi S5/Rs4 (that S5 
is too sexy) is on the list as well. From this time on I will only drive Bmw, 
Audi and Porsche all with warranty. When I get older I might consider owning a 
corvette for a few yrs</p> <br>

<p>Just like bman78, I also only purchase used. You can get WAY more car for 
your money that way. I currently drive an &rsquo;05 Subaru Outback 2.5XT with 
the 5-speed and I love it, sneaky fast and super practical as well as looks 
good. Our other vehicle is an &rsquo;05 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Touring and 
have been very pleased with it, Stow-n-Go seating is totally awesome, and other 
than some issues with the power door harnesses getting glitchy and needing 
replaced, it has been very reliable. I would certainly consider another Subaru 
when time comes to replace the current one, but I won&rsquo;t limit my choices 
to Subarus only. As far as the van, if we decide to stick with a minivan when 
it needs replaced then I will absolutely get another Chrysler, I love the 
versatility of the Stow-n-Go seating. I am a car enthusiast and am intrigued by 
many of the new models available, the Dodge Dart is but one example, I just 
usually buy them after they have been on the market a few years and score a 
smoking deal! My family was traditionally a GM household and my siblings have 
remained that way, sometimes to their detriment, but I try to keep an open mind 
about cars and stay in the loop by reading my Motortrend mag from cover to 
cover every month like I have been doing for the last 15 years!</p> <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I like my 2012 F-150 and the Ecoboost is a sweet power 
plant. The interior is the best on the market with options like A/C and heated 
leather seats, sync, back up camera, etc etc. In 2 years or so when I am ready 
to trade I will consider staying with Ford. It depends on what their new 
generation pickups look like / drive like / etc. I would also look at the Ram 
and the new GM twins. Hell, I might not need a pickup at that point and then 
the world is my oyster!</p> <br>

<p>First car was a Camaro with a 3800 II in it. Super reliable, minus the

warranty cleared that up real well. the audi is a TANK in the snow even with 
the oem hipro pirrelli allseasons, its just so well built. the g37 has some 
rattles when its cold out but besides that a solid car that is very quick and 
handles amazingly. Once the lease is up we are prob gettin a 2013 s4. the jeep 
we are keeping and i would get another srt8 product in a heartbeat. everything

<p>I currently have a Acura TSX which is the best car hands down! It looks 
great, handles well, and best of all, it&rsquo;s inexpensive luxury that 
requires little maintenance. I bought it because the car looked damn fine when 
i bought it in 2003, but it&rsquo;s 2012 now. Acura has not stepped up, their 
cars dont look nice anymore. The current TL has long overhands and it looks 
mishaped. The current TSX should not be priced at $30k, with leather, HID 
lights, a sunroof, and a FOUR cylinder engine, CMON? I rather get a fully 
loaded Accord. CMON ACURA!!!!!!!</p> 
<p>HOWEVER, I would still buy the current MDX if i had a huge family.</p> <br>

<p>I have an 09&Prime; G37 coupe and an 05&Prime; F-150 FX 4 4 door. I own the

get another infiniti if I get a car. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the car but after 4 
years in it it 330 hp seems lacking same with the 305 hp truck. Dont know if I 
will get 2 new or just 1. I&rsquo;ve considered ditching both for an ecoboost 
150 or Unlimited Wrangler. But think I would miss the sporty car too much. I 
will likely keep the truck and go with a &rsquo;13 Mustang GT or slighly used 
11-12 GT 500 maybe SRT8 Challenger. Any suggestions?&gt;&gt;</p> <br>

<p>My next purchase will replace an 07 CR-V. It must be AWD and I hope a 4 
cylinder diesel option will be available. If my diesel hopes are once again 
dashed it will probably be another Subaru after a very nice experience with a 
Forester XT and it will most likely contain a manual transmission. As much as I 
want a diesel (you always want what you can&rsquo;t have I guess) CX-5 I 
don&rsquo;t really need that much room and I&rsquo;m sure it will command a 
substantial premium over the wimpy gasser. A done up Impreza sport hatch stick 
would probably make the most sense but I&rsquo;ve been known to buy with the 
heart- obviously not the CR-V but that was a hand me down. Good commuter car, 
slow but nice, not feeling the new one inside or out.</p> <br>

really the fan all of whole global design, Ford doesn&rsquo;t even look like a

avoid all global cars (Fiesta, Focus, Fusion &hellip;).<br>

<p>No. I own a &rsquo;07 328i, it is expensive to operate and service. It 
seems as if it requires lots of unnecessary service. It will attain 29-30 mpg 
at 80-85 mph and handles well. Replacement tires are very expensive, an oil 
change is right at 100 dollars, a complete four wheel brake job is north of 
$500.00 and since I live in lower Alabama where virtually all terrain is flat, 
there is no need for exceptional handling, not to mention the high cost of 
insuring it. Next time, a high end Camry or Honda with a v6.</p> <br>

<p>Yep would buy Chevy and Honda again. I am just making sure I get a manual

Some of these cars are getting over engineered and too complicated. I would 
defiantly buy another Camaro, yes mine is v6 3800 but they are great and almost 
bullet proof engines except the dex-cool part but lets not get into that. Truck 
wise would go up from K1500 to a Silverado.</p> 
<p>Now that is not saying i will look around. Might look at subaru but only if 
its a STi or WRX. I might look at a Ram 1500 but nothing else truck wise or 
Jeep Grand Cherokee. Not really looking for anything FWD other than 
honda/acura. I very loyal to the brands that take care of me. I have ether seen

really like the entire vehicle lineup of Hyundai and Kia.<br>
 Other brands my 
family have: Toyota (maybe), BMW (maybe), Chevy (probably not).</p> <br>

<p>And it is only getting better! . I am sure you are aware of the new changes 
posted here first of the new Genesis coupe&hellip;more POWER!. 2.0t is now 
274/hp and the 3.8 is 344hp&hellip;Either can be had with an 8-speed auto w/ 
paddle or traditional 6 Speed manual. Handling has been addressed as well as 
steering input. Looks like a shootout is coming when they make it over here!. 
..P.S&hellip;I sell Hyundai..Thank you for your Business, even though it was 
not mine:)</p> <br>

<p>I alternate between Toyota and Honda vehicles. Those companies make the 
best vehicles on the planet. Sometimes, it is hard to choose between the two. I 
feel sorry for fools that get tricked into Detroit products. My brothers and 
sisters own Detroit stuff. They are always having problems.</p> <br>

<p>I own a Detroit product and most of my friends own japanese products and 
they have more problems then I do.</p> <br>

<p>Feel free to buy and drive whatever you want, jt, but spare us the 
&ldquo;fools that get tricked into Detroit products&rdquo; nonsense. I 
currently own my 2nd Ranger to pass 200,000 miles and the $h*ttiest part on 
either was/is the Japanese Mazda transmission (although it is still the 
original one in this one and it is dealing with about a 40% power increase).</p>

<p>How many transmission did you replace on your Hondas?<br>
 Honda should 
include the extra transmission with every new car they sell.</p> <br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind staying with Honda. I love my &rsquo;08 Accord Coupe. 
Odds are when I buy my next car I&rsquo;ll have graduated college with my 
accounting degree and in a good job. I would like to get something German for 
my next car, but I also really like the new Acura ILX, so Honda might get my 
business next time around.</p> <br>

<p>I have had 3 Altimas, 2005, 2008 and 2012 and love all 3. None have given 
me any problems whatsoever and I am definately looking foward to the new Altima

<p>I have an 02 Subaru WRX and the wife has a 07 Hyundai, and I would buy from 
either brand without thinking twice for my next car. BUT, I&rsquo;m always 
interested in a new fun drive, aka Ford is out LOL</p> <br>

<p>Yes. My 2006 Infiniti M35 sport feels like the perfect car for me (size, 
power, driving dynamics, looks&hellip;) I am really starting to look the 2009 
model with 25 more HP and the 7speed trans as a replacement.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m primarily a Ford truck and Chevrolet car guy, but I won&rsquo;t 
rule out a Nissan, Mazda or Chrysler for my next car, and since Ford ditched 
the Ranger, my next 4 cylinder, manual transmission standard cab sport truck 
will probably be based on a Frontier or Tacoma, since Dakotas are too big and 
fuelish, the newest S-10&prime;s available are nearly 10 years old, the current 
Colorado sucks and the next one looks too tall and bloated to appear to be a 
good candidate for the slight lowering with gummy rubber that I do to all my 
trucks.</p> <br>

<p>HELL NO! I have an 06 mits lancer es. It&rsquo;s reliable and good mpg but 
creaks, rattles, and squeaks everywhere. Also, not impressed all at with a 0-60 
time of 10.5 seconds&hellip; And, the interior feels as if it&rsquo;s a 2001. 
Looking at upgrading to an infiniti G or Yamaha R6 in hopefully a year.</p> 
<p>And no to a new Jeep. I am happy with my 92 jeep wrangler w/ blk rims and 
custom orange paint. It&rsquo;s a real head turner. All it needs is some mean 
huge front and rear custom bumpers, a 4&Prime; lift, and possibly an engine 
switchout. Sure wouldn&rsquo;t mind a 5.7L. I hate my 2.5L. I get horrible mpg 
anyways (15).</p>

<p>With the outlook of GM, yes. It really depends on when my Silverado needs 
replaced, and what I need at that time. I porbibly won&rsquo;t need another 
truck sonce I&rsquo;m about done with house projects, so I&rsquo;ll likely go 
to the car I like the best. I will go back into a GM sjowroom first, but that 
doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to get.</p> <br>

<p>I was a GM guy from 16 years old until about two years ago. I switched to 
Ford due to horrible quality issues with the last three cars I bought from GM 
(2 Pontiacs and 1 Chevy) We now have an 07 Edge SEL Plus and a 97 F-150 XLT and 
the quality has been flawless. I would buy another Ford without any hesitation.
<br> PS a torque converter at 3k, just wait until that 3yr 36k warranty is up 
on that Chevy. Nickle, dime, nickle, dime, dollar, dollar, dollar&hellip;.</p>

<p>Well my mother&rsquo;s Tahoe is at 80k, and my grandfather&rsquo;s Tahoe is 
at 168k, neither of which have had a single issue. Every car company has 
vehicles that go wrong eventually, no matter how good their reputation is. I 
have no worries about mine. The torque converter was not actually broken 
either. Onstar kept receiving messages that it was messing up, so the dealer 
went ahead and replaced it as a precaution.</p> <br>

<p>I have an accord and a Saab 9-3. I would buy the Saab again in a heartbeat: 
I can live with the cheap plastics, and the 2.0 turbo engine is fantastic! SAAB 
FOREVER!!! The Honda is a good drive as well, but they have to do something 
about the noise; I am looking forward to the new model.</p> <br>

<p>Let me add that they have been very reliable, and that the Saab gets 
27.5mpg 40/60 city/hwy, while Accord gets 30.5mpg 20/80 city/hwy !!!! VERY 
HAPPY!</p> <br>

<p>20/80 city hwy with a honda accord? Are you coasting down pikes peak the 
whole time? I used to have a 4 cyl accord and I can tell you from experience 
there is no way you are getting 80 MPG&hellip;. the best that thing ever got on 
a all highway trip down to LA was around 35 MPG&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>My friend has a 2002 and it&rsquo;s been really reliable for him, but the 
fuel economy is pretty bad. To be honest though the competition didn&rsquo;t 
get much better, this was a time when 19 city/30 hwy mpg was considered good.

<p>I currently drive a 2009 Silverado LS 4&times;4. I would, without a doubt, 
stay with Chevrolet for my next purchase. It has been driven 26k, trouble-free 
miles, other than a torque converter replacement at about 3k miles. She&rsquo;s

<p>The prompt said to talk about what you cuirrently drive before deciding 
whether or not you would stay with the same company. I did just that, reported 
about my ownership experience thus far. It wasn&rsquo;t meant to be 
significant, nor did I imply that it was.</p> <br>
