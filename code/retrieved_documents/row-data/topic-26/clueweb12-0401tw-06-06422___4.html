<h1>Audi launches electric vehicle pilot programme</h1> 
<p>As it takes steps deeper into the electric vehicle landscape, Audi has 
decided to introduce a pilot programme for itsAudi A3 E-Tron vehicle.</p> 
<p>The Audi A3 E-Tron is a five-seat electric vehicle based on a production 
Audi A3 that features a permanent magnet synchronous motor with output of 60kW 
and peak output of 85kW. Its maximum torque is 270Nm; while its energy storage 
comes from a lithium-ion battery that stores 26.5kWh of usable energy at 
380volts and weighs 300kilograms.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is estimated that with a single battery charge, the Audi E-Tron can 
cover more than 86miles; while it can achieve top speeds of 90mph and race from 
0-62mph in 11.2seconds.</p> 
<p>The vehicle places the emphasis on the driver, who can choose between three 
different driver profile modes. There&rsquo;s dynamic mode, with the electric 
motor delivering its full power, with the air conditioner also working in full; 
auto mode, where both systems are throttled back to extend range; and 
efficiency mode, which is designed for maximum range with the electric motor 
limited to 50kW.</p> 
<p>In addition, the driver can influence energy recovery by choosing from four 
recuperation levels. At the lowest level, the Audi A3 E-Tron can glide freely 
when the driver releases the accelerator; while at the highest level, the car 
brakes strongly and the electric motor acts as a generator. This means that 
when the driver applies pressure to the brake, an electromagnetic brake boost 
pressurises the hydraulic wheel brakes with the electric motor acting as a 
generator and recovering energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The testing will run in the San Francisco, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Washington, 
DC; and Denver, CO; markets until the end of the year. It is hoped that it will 
help Audi identify challenges and opportunities with plug-in vehicles.</p>
