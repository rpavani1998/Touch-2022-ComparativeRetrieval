<h2>Audi UK powers ahead of BMW and Benz</h2> 
<p>By: Glenn Brooks - 29 February 2012 21:48</p> <br>

<p>Just back from the media launch of the facelifted Audi A4, where the 
importer has boasted of a record 6.65% share of the UK market in January. 
That's now a long way ahead of the other premium German brands.</p> 
<p>How has Audi done it? The 42-strong model range (e.g. the A4 range 
comprises the saloon and Avant, plus the same again for the S4, and the allroad 
quattro) helps a great deal, but more than anything, it's about brand 
perception. Put simply, Audi here in the UK does seem to have an enviable image.
</p> 
<p>Of course once you're on top, there's usually only one way to fall but Audi 
UK thinks it can stay number one, even with the imminent launch of the new BMW 
3 Series saloon. In January, 8,563 Audis were sold versus 6,273 for BMW (brand) 
and 6,249 for Mercedes-Benz.</p> 
<p>The revised A4 and S4 range is, Audi says, all about fewer emissions and 
better performance. Sales start on 1 March. I'll publish my thoughts on the new 
cars in a few days' time in one of our Product Eye pieces. But in short, the 
updated A4 line-up is an impressive effort. Oh, and the S4 had me intrigued: I 
know it's got a supercharged V6 under the bonnet but you cannot believe just 
how much it sounds like a V8.</p> <br>
