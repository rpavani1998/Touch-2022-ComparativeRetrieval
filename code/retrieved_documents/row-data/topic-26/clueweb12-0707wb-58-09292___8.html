<h3>#659 of 668 <strong>Certified PreOwned Q7's</strong> by dpix </h3> 
<h4> Oct 15, 2009 (8:18 am) </h4> I've been researching the 2007 &amp; 2008 
Q7's here on edmunds and I see that people seemed to have issues with the 
brakes and rotors going bad at about 18k. My question is would these issues be 
fixed as part of the &quot;certified&quot; inspection process? For example, if 
the rotor and brake problem has been fixed for 2009 will the new parts be a 
part of the 2007/2008 models?

<h3>#660 of 668 <strong>Q7's</strong> by calq7 </h3> 
<h4> Oct 15, 2009 (8:42 am) </h4> I've got a 2007 Q7 with just over 45K in 
miles. I am just to the point of needing new pads on the front brakes and have 
learned that the rotors on these cars are relatively soft and generally require 
replacement with each new set of pads. That will st you back more that 1000 
dollars at the Audi dealer for the front rotors. I have not heard about a lot 
of other brake roblems. However, stay away from the 3.6 liter engine. They have 
had a lot of vibration problems at speeds between 50 to 70 mph. That problem is 
well documented on this site and Audi doesn't seem to have an answer

<h3>#661 of 668 <strong>Special destination in Nav</strong> by dino2k </h3> 
<h4> May 10, 2011 (4:30 pm) </h4> Hi, I have an 09 Q7 3.6 premium S line with 
nav for about 2 1/2 yrs now, no problem so far yet except for the poor brake 
noise since the beginning. I know this might sound lame but am I the only one 
that finds this special destination in the nav a pain in the ass. Instead of 
letting you pick a name for a POI, you have to pick those criteria that they 
give or the address. But what if you dont know the address but you do know the 
name of the POI. Audi does not give me that option to manually spell out my 
destination. I found that all those options aren't that useful since its better 
for us to look for the names because it is easier. I haven't updated my dvd nav 
system yet but I was wondering if they would have an updated version and more 
easier friendly nav for people to use. Audi just makes this navigation really 
difficult for customers to use. Any feedback would be great. Thank you.

<h3>#663 of 668 <strong>Audi Q7 reliability</strong> by spoonball </h3> 
<h4> May 27, 2011 (1:39 pm) </h4> Am considering ordering a 2012 Audi Q7 but J 
D Power and Consumer Reports raise red flags about Audi reliability. My other 
choices are Lexus GX and Acura MDX ( have one of these and would prefer a 
change). Comments?

</h5> I'm not certain 
about the Q7 or what type of reliability you're looking for, but if you look at 
JD Powers VDS from2005 compared to 2011 you'll see newer vehicles across the 
board are much more reliable.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Audi's current score of 161 
(which is below average) would rank higher than the 2005's ranking of Honda, 
Toyota, Acura, Infiniti...<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 So if you trust JD Powers...and 
want the reliability of a 2005ish Toyota...then the Q7 would fit.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> Of course if you trust JD...and only care about reliability then it looks 
like a Lincoln MKX (going by manufacturer) would be the winner.

</h5> I have a 2007 
with the 4.2 liter engine. There have been a number of major problems. The 
first was ultimately traced to the ECM(engine control module). The car stopped 
in the middle of a street and would not restart. It was then towed to the 
nearest dealer where it took them a week to diagnose the problem and get the 
necessary parts from Europe to fix the car. The other major problem was the 
system that controls the height of the vehicle. Occasionally, when turning of 
the car, the from would deflate, completely lowering the front of the car while 
the back remained at the original height. We had trouble replicating this for 
the dealer as it would then correct itself when we turned the vehicle back on. 
We finally had to drive it to the dealer with the front down and leave it on to 
prove what was happening.<br>
 Other smaller problems include a defective 
assembly for the rear roof sun screen. I also feel that the seal coat of the 
paint is soft leading to a finish that is more easily chipped with road 
debris.. The dealer has never acknowledged a problem in this area. Finally, if 
you are considering a 3.6 liter engine, you need to check out the resonant 
vibration problem that has occurred at 50 to 60 mph.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The car 
is a great vehicle to drive with all of the bells and whistles. It takes some 
time to figure out how to use everything, but now we enjoy driving it. I just 
hope that our problems are over!

<h4> Jun 06, 2011 (2:10 pm) </h4> I am planning to buy a SUV. Considering 
between AUDI Q7 or BMW X5. I am really confused which one to buy. My preference

<h3>#668 of 668 <strong>audi escondido</strong> by 08q7 </h3> 
<h4> Dec 02, 2011 (3:25 pm) </h4> I love, love my 2008 q7 but took it to my 
local dealer and after 3 weeks of them having my car. I am not only going to 
cancel my a6 on order but sell my current q7.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Escondido Audi 
has ruined any enjoyment of owning an audi. They state audi will not allow them 
to repair the mmi issue I had. The issue was that the left side mmi buttons 
would not work<b>when it rained sometimes</b>... I just got back from the 
dealership and it is worst.. Now none of the mmi lights work and the round 
thingy doesnt move anything on the screen and it is not raining..<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> I am livid. I offered to pay the $1200 for the repair to be fixed and they 
<b>declined saying they are scared I will take them to small claims</b>.. If 
they did honest business they would not have to worry about smart 
customers...WTF?? here is a video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2BpNGfYqUY 
<br> &nbsp;<br>
 Horrible horrible customer service on both sides... what a 
shame. Such fun cars but not worth $55,000 to be treated horribly...
