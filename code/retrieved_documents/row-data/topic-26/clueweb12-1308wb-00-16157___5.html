<h1>Audi A4</h1> 
<h2>The A4 is a revelation; it&rsquo;s our new class-leader.</h2> <br>
<br>

Auto Express Car Reviews <br>

<ul> 
<li> Rating: </li> 
<li>Latest deal price: from &pound;19,983 to &pound;27,308</li> 
<li>On the road price: <em>&pound;23,415&nbsp;-&nbsp;&pound;36,845</em></li> 
<li>For <em>: Looks modern, is great to drive and own, refined and desirable
</em></li> 
<li>Against <em>: Small trim line-up, not quite as economical as a 3-Series
</em></li> </ul> <strong>Driving</strong> <br>
Dynamically, the latest A4 is a 
revelation. It&rsquo;s been transformed over older models, and seems so much 
more grown up. It has better body control than any of its rivals and feels 
sure-footed in corners. The steering is sharp and the turn-in positive, and 
while it isn&rsquo;t as dynamic as a 3-Series, it&rsquo;s far more composed 
than a Mercedes. The Audi strikes a good balance when it comes to ride quality, 
too. It&rsquo;s firm but not harsh, and excellent damping means the A4 is taut 
without being unforgiving. The most popular engine is likely to be the 
2.0-litre TDI, and it too has an impressive range of abilities. Power arrives 
quickly, is delivered smoothly and it&rsquo;s also quiet and refined, too. 
Other engines include an impressive 1.8-litre turbo petrol, plus V6 diesel and 
petrol powerplants.<br>
<br>
<strong>Marketplace</strong> <br>
The newcomer has 
a distinctively sporting appearance, but it&rsquo;s still unmistakable &ndash; 
not just as an Audi, but as an A4. The saloon shares front-end styling with the 
A5 Coupe, and its sharp lines have a taut, strong look. An Avant estate sits 
alongside it in the line-up. Natural rivals are the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes 
C-Class; these German models dominate the compact executive saloon sector, but 
rejuvenated &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; machinery such as the Ford Mondeo and 
Mazda 6 will also claim to be good-value alternatives. There are two A4 trims, 
SE and S-line, offered with a quickly expanding line of engines.<br>
<br>

<strong>Owning</strong> <br>
The sense of luxury and attention to detail 
continues inside; it&rsquo;s similar to Audi&rsquo;s top-of-the-range A8 limo. 
The layout, quality and feel of the cabin, which features the same dash as the 
A5, is smarter than any rival&rsquo;s. If we were being critical, the plastic 
panel on the dash-mounted CD changer is a bit shiny, although it only stands 
out because everything else is so impressive. An electronic parking brake and 
Multi Media Interface screen, first seen in the A6 and A8, are fitted as 
standard. Ergonomically, it&rsquo;s superb, and there&rsquo;s lots of steering 
wheel and seat adjustment, plus ample stowage space. Combine this with more 
rear legroom than any rival bar the Ford Mondeo, and the interior is a winner. 
It&rsquo;s even economical to run. List prices undercut a 3-Series, insurance 
ratings are competitive, retained values are impressive and fuel economy strong 
(although the exceptional BMW beats it on this score).<br>

<h4> </h4> 
<p> I bought a new A4 exec S line 2.0 TDI in November and having had an A4 SE 
previously I immediately thought that the suspension on the S line was going to 
be too firm for me, having had the car for a few months I love it. It is a 
fantastic car to live with on a daily basis and I think it is a wonderful 
vehicle on the motorway.<br>
I have had lots of comments about what a good 
looking car it is and I have to agree, it is.</p>
