<p>Earlier this week we played Desert Island in our Thread of the Day, and 
asked you to pick five cars &ndash; three cars for you, one for your 
significant other, and one for your teenager &ndash; that you&rsquo;d want to 
be trapped on a desert island for all of eternity with. &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s
Thread of the Day is a play on that theme.</p> 
<p>For Today&rsquo;s Thread of the Day, <strong>Frisky_Dingo</strong> asks the 
question, &ldquo;If you had to choose just<em>one</em> vehicle to own for the 
rest of your life, to be used for every purpose and driving need, what would it 
be?&rdquo; Here are the rules:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>It has to be a factory-offered production vehicle, so concepts, 
prototypes, and modified vehicles (like<strong>Frisky_Dingo&rsquo;s</strong> 
&ldquo;G37 with a GT-R driveline&rdquo; example) don&rsquo;t count.</li> 
<li>Cost is no object.</li> 
<li>The car can be new or old, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; keep in mind it will 
be your only car, for the rest of your life and maintaining something like a 
vintage Jaguar E-Type might be troublesome.</li> </ol> 
<p>Before we turn things over to you, a couple things to keep in mind &ndash; 
this will be the<em>only </em>car you will ever have for the rest of your life. 
As<strong>Frisky_Dingo </strong>said, &ldquo;If you pick a Veyron now, and five 
years down the road have a family, you&rsquo;re walking everywhere, or cramming 
them in the luggage compartment.&rdquo; With that in mind initial responses 
from the staff include theCadillac CTS-V Wagon, Audi RS4 Avant, and Porsche 
Panamera Turbo S &ndash; all practical, yet fun. Enough about us though, have 
at it in the comments below.</p>

<p>There is no correct answer to this question. No automobile has even been 
manufactured to last decades. Programmed obsolescence. How many of us are 
driving a car from the 80s at this point? One that has been driven daily since 
new? No one? I wonder why&hellip;<br>
 Even if you TRY to maintain a car 
meticulously, the manufacturer will step in and purposely stop making parts to 
dash all hopes to keeping the thing in good running condition: exhibit A: the 
97-98 Lincoln Mark VIII. Can&rsquo;t buy a new head light bulb, they&rsquo;re 
discontinued now almost 7 years. Can&rsquo;t buy the retrofit headlight kits 
that Ford used to offer to install conventional halogen bulbs, they have been 
discontinued for 5 years now. You&rsquo;re left with shade tree engineering to 
make something work, either that, or you just don&rsquo;t drive after dark.</p>

<p>My choice would be an Infiniti FX 50S, white with a black interior. Sporty 
looks and performance, awd for bad weather, seats 4, 5 in a pinch, and does 
have some carrying ability, at least for the things I would be hauling. If I 
had endless resources, than it would have to be the Ferrari FF, blood red with 
camel interior. That thing&rsquo;s a beast!</p> <br>

<p>Easy my Chevy K1500 ext-cab small block V8. It can fit 6 people and still 
carry what is needed. Plus if it isn&rsquo;t really windy out I can get 22 mpg 
on a 16 year old truck. And since it has the 1 of the 100 Million small blocks 
produced in the past half century, I don&rsquo;t think parts are going to be 
hard to come by. The other thing is it is basic, yes it does have some 
electronically controlled parts but it is nowhere near the amount that is on 
the cars today, plus if the electrical system ever wears out (i doubt it) just 
bolt up a carbureted small block and convert the fuel delivery. Plus you can 
never get bored adding stuff, lifts, headers, tires, bull bar, heck you could 
turbo or supercharger it for all i care, but the point is the list is endless
</p> 
<p>Plus if the Apocalypse comes i know it will still continue running. XD</p>

<p>I once knew a young lady who, if you looked at her objectively, was not 
very attractive, yet she exuded a sensual aura that made every male in any room 
she entered take notice. What does this have to do with my ultimate car choice? 
Well, assuming I hit the mega millions or something, the car I would have in my 
driveway would be the new Panamera GTS.</p> <br>

<p>People can&rsquo;t be serious when answering with an exotic sports car. The 
question was one car for every driving purpose. (Yeah, lets load up some home 
improvement supplies in an Aventador. Come on people)</p> 
<p>In that case, with maintenance costs not considered, I would go with a 
Range Rover Sport in Autobiography trim. It&rsquo;s got the size, engine, and 
awesome interior. That&rsquo;s a practical answer to the question at hand.</p>

<p>Besides, who wants to go through life with a car that every time the proper 
RR pulls up next to you your embarrassed?</p> <br>

<p>Hey 40Rouge, not everyone is a Bob Villa wannabe, OK? Some like myself live 
just fine and dandy with a two seater that hauls nothing but ass.</p> 
<p>Practical for you====laughable horseshit for myself. The question is which 
car YOU yourself would want most. For every driving purpose, a sports car works 
great for ME.</p> 
<p>What the funk is Autobiography trim on a Range Rover?? LMAO That&rsquo;s 
really gonna impress all the F150-driving contractors over at Lowe&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to go small like a Range Rover Evoque, but I need more room 
for the kids, dogs and towing capacity. That said I was thinking a Suburban LTZ 
would do the trick, but then I thought about something I&rsquo;ve always 
wanted. A Hummer H1 Alpha open top. The fun of a convertible, the torque to tow 
whatever I want, the ability to go anywhere, and room for the family. Of course 
I would have to do some extensive customization to make the interior a little 
more comfortable and roomy, as well as converting it to bio-diesel, and maybe 
adding four wheel steering (I love my current Suburban and the quadrasteer is 
the reason I won&rsquo;t give it up). As an added bonus I won&rsquo;t have to 
worry about the body disintegrating on the Hummer!</p> <br>

<p>The car that I would pick if I had to have only one car for the rest of my 
life would be the Audi RS6 Avant.<br>
 572hp bi-turbo v10. It has the style the 
speed, the handling, and I can use it for everything. I have yet to find a 
german car that can provide more usability than the RS6 Avant. The M5 cant cut 
it being only RWD and the AMG E-Class Wagon is for men who have a burning 
desire to be a woman at heart!</p> <br>

<p>to me, just one car means it needs to do just about everything I want it to 
&ndash; decent mileage, fun to drive, hauls stuff and moves people when needed 
and fits on crowded intercity streets. The only one that does this well with a 
decent amount of performance is the Golf R. However, I can&rsquo;t quite afford 
one of those, so a Golf TDI or GTI would most likely do the trick.</p> <br>

to be an SUV. I&rsquo;d pick the new Cayenne Turbo. If offroad wasn&rsquo;t in

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say, my all time favorite.. 2013 Nissan GTR (SpecV or 
some other special version preferably), black on black.. My life would be that 
car, I&rsquo;d make love to it, kiss it daily, buy it flowers, anniversery 
gifts each year, my wife would probably leave me for spending too much time 
with my other girl (GTR), etc.. I&rsquo;ve been in love with Skylines since I 
was a kid, I&rsquo;ve waited for YEARS for them to be released stateside, and 
now that they finally are, I&rsquo;d literally give away a kidney for one.. Any 
takers?</p> <br>

<p>Mercedes E63 Wagon hands down, It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s comfortable on 
long trips because it&rsquo;s a big Mercedes, handles well, and it&rsquo;s a 
wagon that seats 7 so if you squint it&rsquo;s kind of a mini van. 
Alternatively I would like a Range Rover Sport because it can tow and go off 
road like a big suv but is also sporty like an m5.</p> <br>

<p>Either the Caddy Wagon, V version of course, or the Jeep SRT8. I rode in 
the 6.1 at the SRT Track Expierence and was nothing but impressed and can only 
imagine the new 6.4 is even better. The CTS-V because it is like a station 
waggon dragster. Both will shock an untrained eye and can turn rubber into

plenty of room in the rear seats for a family, has a decent to large trunk for 
anything you might need to transport, its a convertible so you could truly

could possibly imagine and its is an absolute joy to drive. Probably with the 
Candyapple Red, or Presidential Blue paint, two timeless colors as well.</p>

<p>The newest generation WRX STI hatch. Looks good, sounds awesome, goes fast, 
has plenty of passenger and cargo room, can go almost anywhere to do anything, 
and did I mention the sound? To me, this is one of those apocalypse situation 
questions where you have to think what would be the best car given any possible 
situation.</p> <br>

<p>BMW M5. It&rsquo;s fun, fast, and practical. I can drive my family to the 
mall and go out on the track.</p> <br>

<p>the m3 kills the m5, have you heard of the # 200 fuse, is a disgrace to bmw 
m&rsquo;s plus what cant a m3 not do than an m5 cant, the m5 is to heavy while 
the m3 is just perfect</p> <br>

<p>Did you not see the word &lsquo;practical&rsquo;? An M3 isn&rsquo;t 
practical. I&rsquo;d take an M5 over an M3 sedan 7 days a week.</p> <br>

<p>While the BMW M3 is funnier and faster it has a tiny trunk and back seat. 
Plus the 5er looks SEXY!</p> <br>

<p>Couldnt agree more,, it is very rare to see a CTS V wagon in th street, but 
what a magnificent car, I would take it automatic, because is faster. The shift 
paddles need to be fix before buying I buy one lol, and the magnetic ride just 
kills it, its also roomy and very good looking, the regular CTS V just looks as 
if it was cut with an axe while the wagon has some good style and performence
