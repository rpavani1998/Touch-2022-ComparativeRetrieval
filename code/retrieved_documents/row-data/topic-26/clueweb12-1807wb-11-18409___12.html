<br> Audi navigation system / Audi Navigation plus system <br>
<br>
The Audi 
navigation systemdepends upon signals from the worldwide Global Positioning 
Satellite network. The vehicle's electrical system, and existing wireless and 
satellite technologies, must be available and operating properly for the system 
to function. The system is designed to provide you with suggested routes in 
locating addresses, destinations, and other points of interest. Changes in 
street names, construction zones, traffic flow, points of interest or other 
road changes are beyond the control of Audi of America, Inc. Complete detailed 
mapping of lanes, roads, streets, toll roads, highways, etc., is not possible, 
therefore you may encounter discrepancies between the mapping and your actual 
location. Please rely on your individual judgment in determining whether or not 
to follow a suggested Audi navigation system route. Periodically the mapping is 
updated, and a new DVD will be required in order to maintain the latest 
navigational information available to us. These will be available for purchase 
from time to time at additional cost. Consult your dealer or call 
1-800-FOR-AUDI for details.<br>

Restrictions - Bluetooth&reg; Interface <br>
<br>
Your Audi vehicle may be 
equipped with a phone preparation utilizing Bluetooth&reg;interface to enable 
hands-free functionality (compatible mobile phones sold separately). You will 
need a Bluetooth&reg; enabled mobile phone in order to utilize this function. 
Not all Bluetooth&reg; enabled mobile phone models are compatible with Audi's 
phone preparation. Visit our website or contact your local Audi dealer, for the 
latest listing of compatible phones. Audi recommends the use of the Audi phone

Summer Performance Tires <br>
<br>
Summer performance tires are 
designed for optimum performance and handling in warm climates. They are not 
suitable for cold, snowy or icy weather conditions. If you drive under those 
circumstances, you should equip your vehicle with all-season or winter tires, 
which offer better traction under those conditions. We suggest you use the 
recommended winter or all-season tires specified for your car or their 
equivalent. These summer performance tires also have a lower aspect ratio that 
aids performance and handling; however, in order to avoid tire, rim or vehicle 
damage, it is important that the inflation pressure is regularly checked and 
maintained at recommended levels. Serious wheel and tire damage may occur if 
the vehicle is operated on rough or damaged road surfaces, or upon encountering 
road debris or obstacles. Please also remember in making your selection that, 
while these tires deliver responsive handling, they may ride less comfortably 
and make more noise than other choices. Finally, these tires may wear more 
quickly than other choices. For more information on all of these topics, please 
consult the owner's manual, your local dealer or call 1-800-FOR-AUDI.<br>
