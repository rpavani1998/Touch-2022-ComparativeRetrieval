Shox, Rear</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Break time is over. It's time to install the rear half of the&nbsp;Mopar 
Stage 3 Lift Kit with Fox Racing Shox on our 2012 Jeep Wrangler.</p> 
<p>The front suspension installation, Part I of our story, appears one blog 
below this one.&nbsp;The front end installation involved the drilling of 14 
holes, the mechanized removal of two bump stops and the intentional destruction 
of two brackets. There's not near as much metal manipulation back here. This 
end is a cake walk in comparison.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>First I need to reposition the two tall jack stands and lower the Jeep's 
rear axle onto them with ourRotary lift until&nbsp;the axle's&nbsp;weight is 
supported and the rear shocks are compressed ever so&nbsp;slightly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The rear shocks are the component that defines how far the axle can hang, 
so they need to come off right away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The stabilizer links are next to go. They're destined to be 
replaced&nbsp;with longer ones, so they can go in the trash can alongside the 
shocks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Like the front, the rear axle is located by 4 trailing links and a lateral 
track bar (a.k.a. Panhard bar.)&nbsp;Once again their&nbsp;10 bolts are to be 
loosened, but not removed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The sole exception is the bolt on the&nbsp;left-hand end of the track bar 
(yellow.) It gets taken out so&nbsp;the track bar&nbsp;can hang out of the way 
for the next few steps.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The parking brake cables will still be&nbsp;long enough once the 3-inch 
Mopar lift is&nbsp;installed, but only after I remove and discard the factory 
retaining bracket so they can hang down a bit more.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The&nbsp;brake line retaining brackets are disconnected, too, but no parts 
will be thrown away here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once the brake brackets are loose it's time to raise the lift enough to 
take the weight off the coil springs and open up a gap so I can pull them out. 
The rear differential breather hose (yellow) doesn't like it much, but I'll 
deal with that later on.</p> 
<p>The rubber spring cushion seen on the uppermost coil will be reused, but 
the springs are now boat anchors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now the lower trailing links can be removed and replaced. The new ones are 
longer in order to keep the rear differential pinion angle&nbsp;at the proper 
angle with respect to the driveshaft. The extra length also keeps the wheelbase 
from shrinking.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Both ends of the one on the passenger side can be bolted (loosely,) but the 
one of the driver side needs to hang out for a couple steps while I do 
something else with its rear mounting bracket.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This new bracket moves the left pointing point of the track bar up three 
inches so it will run at the same angle (nearly flat) after the three inch lift 
is installed.</p> 
<p>One of its mounting holes (yellow) will share the bolt used to mount the 
link we saw in the last photo.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here the trailing link has been installed with its mounting bolt also 
running through the new track bar bracket. Meanwhile, I'm installing a u-bolt 
around the axle tube&nbsp;to hold the other end of the track bar bracket in 
place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unlike the suspension link bolts, the u-bolts can be torqued to their final 
tightening spec right now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now it's time to re-mount the left end of the track bar in the new bracket.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>New upper trailing links go in next. Keep your eye on the urethane bump 
stop because it's about to disappear.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>No, the old bump stop is not in there. I removed it before installing these 
new cups. They snap in place over the old bump stop retaining bracket.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A new longer microcellular urethane bump stop will snap into 
the&nbsp;original bracket; the cup's job is to keep it&nbsp;lined up 
vertically. Silicone spray helps it snap into place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But it still takes persistence to finally snap it home.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Things are moving along quickly now. It's already time for the new longer 
stabilizer bar links to go on.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I've bragged on the Craftsman Max Axxes external drive socket set before as 
a good deep socket alternative, but this is brilliant. Stabilizer bar ball 
joints and many strut tops&nbsp;feature an internal hex you're supposed to hold 
still while you tighten the nut, and it's always a bit of a hassle.</p> 
<p>Ratcheting end wrenches work, too, but you have to buy them one size at a 
time. Owning a whole range of them is not cheap.&nbsp;The Max 
Axxess&nbsp;socket set is a lot less expensive,&nbsp;and it works great as a 
regular ratchet, a deep socket alternative, as well as&nbsp;this particular 
situation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These brake bracket extensions drop the hoses down&nbsp;so they'll still 
work with the lifted suspension. I haven't cracked open any brake lines, so 
they'll be no brake bleeding later.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do have to reshape the hard part of the brake line by hand to make sure 
it clears the stabilizer bar end link, though.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is moving along fast. It's already time to install the rear springs.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The lower end of the spring drops easily onto its seat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mopar's kit&nbsp;comes with the special tool that helps&nbsp;get a 
retaining nut up in behind the spring seat...</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>...so I can install this spring retainer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This spring retainer holds the spring in place at the top,&nbsp;and the 
bolt&nbsp;goes into an existing hole. That's right;&nbsp;I still haven't cut or 
drilled anything at the rear axle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here's another&nbsp;of those Nutserts&nbsp;we saw during the front 
suspension installation. This one goes into&nbsp;another existing hole in the 
frame for the rear limiting strap.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can bet what's coming next.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That's right, the rear limit strap needs a hole to&nbsp;connect to, so I've 
got to make one. Two, actually, because I'm doing all of this on the other 
side, too. But you knew that.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now I can tighten the lower limit strap bolt. Incidentally, the hole I 
drilled made it necessary to remove one of two clips (orange) holding the ABS 
wire in place.</p> 
<p>On an unrelated note, all of the trailing arm bushing bolts, front and 
rear, get these rectangular positioning&nbsp;shims&nbsp;where they bolt to the 
axle. Mopar says these lock the links&nbsp;into just the right position&nbsp;so 
no wheel alignment is necessary after the kit is installed.</p> 
<p>The only adjustment needed is a small change in the length of the drag link 
to re-center the steering wheel, and that's a cosmetic adjustment&nbsp;that can 
be eyeballed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now it's time to install the Fox Racing Shox. There's a simple trick that 
makes it easy: compress the shock fully on the floor, then quickly swing 
it&nbsp;into the lower bracket and let the internal gas pressure 
&quot;grow&quot; the shock into the upper mount.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the last steps in the process is the installation of a new 
rectangular&nbsp;landing pad&nbsp;for the rear bump stop. It bolts into 
existing holes.</p> 
<p>This is probably my favorite picture of the bunch. Clockwise from the left 
we have: upper trailing link (with the lower one partially hidden below); limit 
strap; ABS signal wire; bump stop (with the spring partially hidden behind); 
track bar and in new bracket; Fox Racing Shock; rubber brake hose; stabilizer 
bar and link.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Can it be? Are we done?&nbsp;Not quite. There are a few more things to take 
care of. But for those we&nbsp;must lift the Jeep high up on the lift and 
retire our trusty&nbsp;orange floor jacks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's still the matter of reconnecting the driveshaft, and there's a 
small issue. A 3-inch suspension lift requires the driveshaft to hang down at a 
steeper angle. But here it's hitting the exhaust system.</p> 
<p>This is only an issue with 2012 Wranglers like ours, the ones with the new 
Pentastar V6 engine. 2007-2011 JKs with the older engine don't have the same 
exhaust routing and there's no interference. The next couple of steps apply 
only to 2012 JK Wranglers&nbsp;(and later if you're reading this in the future.)
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These are exhaust spacers. It's hard to tell, but the one on the left is a 
little longer. These parts are fairly new, and their installation isn't 
described in the draft set of instructions I'm working from. So, after careful 
study of the parts and the vehicle,&nbsp;I'm making this up as I go along.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They bolt to the forward legs of the central y-pipe in order to push it 
back and allow the driveshaft to clear. But pushing the y-pipe back has 
knock-on effects farther downstream. Theoretically, the&nbsp;rear pipes and the 
muffler&nbsp;would also get pushed back the length of the spacers, and I 
figured that&nbsp;would put pressure on the exhaust hangers and move the pipe 
close to my new springs.</p> 
<p>I decided&nbsp;a little adjustment is in order.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the pipe to go back this indexing nub has to come off. </p> 
<p>Scott and I had this plan for a dramatic action shot, with me swinging a 
hammer while holding a chisel. While he went for another lens I made a gentle 
exploratory tap ... and it came right off. Oh well.</p> 
<p>That blue tape contains a scratch mark for the next step.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Yes, I'm cutting off a bit of the pipe. The dimension I chose corresponds 
to the length of the shorter of the two spacers -- the reason for that will 
become clear in a moment.</p> 
<p>Mopar later told me this&nbsp;cut wasn't necessary, that removing the nub 
was enough on it's own and I could do that with the y-pipe still in the 
car.&nbsp;Removing the nub, they say, allows the y-pipe to telescope into the 
rear pipe a little bit, and the flex in the rubber hangars would make up the 
rest.</p> 
<p>Maybe they're right. (Of course they're right.) But this way isn't wrong, 
it's just more time consuming. My exhaust hangars will&nbsp;hang exactly as 
they did before and the pipe slip-joint&nbsp;will engage exactly the same 
amount.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The long spacer goes on the passenger side, where the exhaust pipe runs at 
a downward angle.&nbsp;Because of this angle, only a portion of its length 
contributes to a shift to the rear.&nbsp;And the&nbsp;magnitude of that shift 
is exactly equal to...</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>...the length of the short spacer, which goes on the driver side where the 
pipe points straight back. And that's why the length of my cut equaled the 
length of the short spacer.</p> 
<p>Notice how the y-pipe's cross tube runs just ahead of the frame cross 
member. It's close, but&nbsp;there's still a good half inch of daylight.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now the driveshaft can go back together. But first I need to put a dab of 
fresh thread locking compound on the bolts.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This concludes the driveshaft&nbsp;detour part of our show.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here I'm splicing in an additional&nbsp;section of&nbsp;breather hose I 
bought at my local auto parts store. Technically speaking I bought&nbsp;fuel 
line hose, but it's the&nbsp;same size. Mopar later told me it's also possible 
to unfasten the upper end of the hose&nbsp;from its factory mount and 
reposition it with tie-wraps, but my hands wouldn't fit up in there.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All of the trailing arm and track bar bushings get tightened and torqued 
once the Jeep is back down on its tires. I'll spend a lot of time crawling 
around underneath&nbsp;to get it done, but three extra inches of newfound lift 
make&nbsp;it fairly easy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>OK,&nbsp;<em>now</em> we're done!&nbsp;I made the steering drag link 
adjustment to re-center the steering wheel while you weren't looking. (In my 
driveway after driving it home, if you must know.)</p> 
<p>If you thought the rear&nbsp;installation looked easier than the front, 
you're right.&nbsp;Now that I've done it, this isn't 
ridiculously&nbsp;difficult with the right tools. Thing is, the &quot;right 
tools&quot; is no small list. And our Rotary Lift certainly helped. I'm sure it 
could be done without such a lift, but it wouldn't be easy.</p>

<p>@fast4door - what's the approximate cost difference between the two?</p>

<p>06:50 AM, 03/19/12</p> 
<p>Raptor MSRP $42725. Jeep, as purchased, $22570.</p> 
<p>Lift kit: $2400<br>
 6 hours of dealer labor if they installed lift kit: 
$600<br>
 Tires: $1166<br>
 Wheels: couldn't find the price, let's assume $50 
each = $200<br>
 Total: almost $27000. </p> 
<p>The delta is $15,750, but you still end up with a road-unworthy dune buggy 
with no roof. For 27 grand, I could get a Polaris side by side ATV, a trailer 
to tow it, and a cheap, comfortable pickup to get it to the trailhead. And my 
date wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen in the comfortable pickup.</p> Report It

<p>I've typed my rant to your 'logic', erased it, and will ask you this: 
Soooo, you're justifying the purchase of a Raptor by downplaying the Jeep?</p> 
<p>You've cut your payload in half, cut the towing ability almost in half, and 
a &quot;better ride&quot;? Floaty does not mean better. The Raptor is a purpose 
built vehicle. Desert running only.</p> 
<p>And you just payed a BASE price of 42k to diminsh everything that makes a 
truck a truck.</p> 
<p>If you don't get Jeep's, say, &quot;I don't get Jeeps&quot; and leave it at 
that.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

 1. The raptor is an entirely different type of offroader 
than a Jeep. Other than they both go off-road, the design goals are completely 
different. Plus, as you said $16K is nothign to sneeze at for most folks.<br>
 
2. Where are you going to store your Polaris ATV and trailer? Not everyone has 
a garage or wants extra vehicles (which entail extra cost, insurance, 
registration, upkeep, etc.)<br>
 3. You can't take your Polaris ATV on an 
off-road thru park camping trip (i.e. where your destination is different than 
your starting point).<br>
 4. Many people just like Wranglers. And the 2DR 
doesn't feel like any other car, on-road or off.</p> 
<p>Anywaym, with the logic you displayed you should stick with your 
comfortable truck. Your girlfriend already has planty to be embarassed about.

<p>Time out time out time out. Don't get personal.</p> 
<p>Project Jeep takes a street legal jeep and makes it as off-roadey as 
possible, right? In the process it's costing $27k. What you end up with is a 
vehicle that is purpose-built, has no creature comforts, and on-road it rides 
like a jeep. The end result is a vehicle that's not practical on road. Much 
like a dune buggy. Except more expensive.</p> 
<p>What terrain can the Jeep handle that the Raptor can't? Rock-crawling?</p>

<p>I think the point is that, while the Raptor and the Jeep have similar 
off-road abilities, they are still two distinct vehicles with different kinds 
of buyers. There are very few people who would be in the market for both of 
these vehicles. Most buyers would either want a truck or a Wrangler. The reason 
people on this blog have responded the way they have is because your first post 
was mostly irrelevant and took an attacking tone on what is a very interesting 
blog post.</p>

<p>The Jeep posts are interesting, but it's a bizarre project. Why expend so 
much time and money on a vehicle to do off-roading while there are other 
alternatives that offer better value? The girlfriend comment was just to point 
out that the vehicle isn't good at anything besides off-roading.</p> 
<p>It's like an Ariel Atom. Yes you'll go fast, but that's it. It's a 
purpose-built track car that happens to be street legal. There's no roof, it 
costs a fortune, it's ugly etc. Give me an M3 or an EVO that will do 95% of 
that performance, and I can still get a car seat in the back.</p> 
<p>The larger point is it's easy to skew to one aspect of performance when you 
ignore everything else. The real engineering and design challenge is to make it 
all work to high standards together.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>09:51 AM, 03/19/12</p> 
<p>If you do any off roading, you should know that most technical trails are 
not made for full-size trucks.<br>
 Switchbacks, the fact that most of these 
trails were not made for vehicles that had engines. They had horsepower, but 
like 4-6. The Raptor is way too wide for most trails.</p> 
<p>No creature comforts? Have you seen the new Wranglers? I have an F-150, but 
I've been a Jeep guy most of my life. Work dictates the truck. I have one of 
the best and most luxurious vehicles I've owned. For people that scoff at that; 
a) I'm not saying it will rival an A8, b) try sitting in one of these, they're 
amazing. As for the Jeep, you can get heated leather seats, power everything, 
the ride on road is not as bad as you want to pretend you know about it. It 
rides pretty nice and this set-up will make it better.</p> 
<p>How exactly is not 'practical' on the road? I'm not getting personal, it's 
just that your logic is seriously flawed, you have blinders on about your 
Raptor (which is a great truck) and don't know as much about the Jeep as you 
think. It seems as though you've never even been in one. You act as though you 
need two people to keep it straight going down the road and that it hops side 
to side when it goes over a pebble. This isn't a CJ5.</p> 
<p>DRIVE ONE, and take the top off, then you will get it.</p> Report ItReport

 I'll retract my personal jab at your logic and offer my 
apology.</p> 
<p>But, my 4 points still stand and I'll ad a fifth.</p> 
<p>Many people can afford, and want, a base $21K Wrangler. They have an 
appeal. After 3-4 years of ownership, they may now have the money to improve 
their vehicle should they want. They may end up with something that cost $27K, 
but many people cannot pay that all upfront. Now, one can argue they should 
save up then. But, I'll counter that by saying many people often need a car now 
- like when their other one craps out and isn't worth fixing.</p> Report It

<p>Dan, great couple of posts. I'd hate to try that job in my (Rotary 
Lift-free) garage, that would be a PAIN. So I guess I gotta get one. Right 
after I get the new house with the three car garage....</p> 
<p>And Dan, I assume you were wearing ear plugs while using the cutoff 
tool...right?</p> Report ItReport It <br>

<p>Dan,<br>
 Great job and I now need to put some of those Max access wrenches 
in my toolbox! Very nice find.<br>
 The Jeep looks great.</p> 
<p>My take on the silly Raptor argument?<br>
 1. The whole point of the Jeep 
is that it's a small, open top, solid axle 4x4.<br>
 That's the enjoyment of 
it. It can easily go places the Raptor can't, and you can experience<br>
 the 
world in a totally different way.</p> 
<p>2. If you are any kind of gearhead, you will spend $20K on ANY vehicle you 
buy.<br>
 Raptor, Jeep, Mustang, Audi, VW, BMW, Corvette... doesn't matter. <br>
 Wrenching blood is wrenching blood.</p> 
<p>3. You gain a level of knowledge about your ride that you NEED to have with 
a 4x4.<br>
 Things break: new or old, fancy or simple. If you know what's going 
on, it's always easy to problem-solve.</p> 
<p>Raptor is a great vehicle but totally different vehicle. It doesn't apply 
here.<br>

<p>Okay, first one thing we all agree on: Dan is the bomb. Many of us could 
not comprehend even doing this work ourselves.</p> 
<p>Another thing we agree on: the Raptor and Project Jeep can do amazing 
things.</p> 
<p>Last: We all want a rotary lift in our garage.</p> 
<p>As for the rest, I'll leave it alone. I live where we have real Winter with 
a capital W (although not so much this year). I would never choose a softtop. 
Then the only option is a hardtop which I would never remove.</p> Report It

<p>I like the versitility of a soft top, but so much more to deal with. About 
the only vehicle you leave unlocked so that no one cuts into your soft top.</p> 
<p>Rotary lift? I would pretty much have to give the wife the rest of the 
house in order for her to agree on it. Worthy trade? Um, YEAH.</p> Report It

 ________________________________</p> 
<p>Smilez, all soft-top convertibles can easily be cut open. There is no 
logical reason why one would not lock a Jeep but will lock a Miata or Boxster. 
I always hear this about Wranglers but nobody brings up the same issue with any 
other ragtop.</p> 
<p>If you don't want your top cut, do not leave valuables in plain sight. This 
is good advice for any car, soft-top or hard roof.<br>
 And personally, I'd 
rather have a soft top cut than a widow broken, or worse yet, body damage due 
to an over jealous theif with a punch and screwdriver.</p> Report ItReport It

<p>@fast4door: I'm not sure what you're getting at, and I'm having trouble 
following your thought process. The Raptor is a completely different vehicle 
(desert runner vs. rock crawler). The Wrangler is a lot cheaper than the 
Raptor. And the new Wrangler with the Pentastar is pretty capable both on and 
off-road. Would it get worse with the lift kit? Probably not by a whole lot.</p>
<p>&quot;The real engineering and design challenge is to make it all work to 
high standards together.&quot;</p> 
<p>You mean like a lift kit made by MOPAR, Jeep's parts division?</p> Report It
