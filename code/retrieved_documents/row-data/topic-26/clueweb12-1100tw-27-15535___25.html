<p>It is with a keenly self-aware fear of apostasy that BMW has declined to 
fit its brand-defining inline-6 engine to the 2012 BMW 328i and instead has 
substituted a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.</p> 
<p>This sea change aligns the entry-level version of the 3 Series with its 
four-cylinder competitors, the 2012 Audi A4 and 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250. But in 
light of BMW's rich tradition of inline-6 engines and its loyal following of 
customers, is this new four-cylinder really progress?</p> 
<p>This test aims to find out.</p> 
<p>BMW's fear is justified. These are all very good cars. After two weeks, 
hundreds of miles of side-by-side driving and one day of track testing, a clear 
winner had yet to emerge. The new 2012 BMW 328i wasn't walking away from its 
competition, as have so many 3 Series models in past<em>Inside Line</em> 
comparison tests.</p> 
<p>After all, here we've got an Audi that's clearly the BMW's better when it 
comes to measured evaluations of handling, while the distinctly well-built 
Mercedes-Benz strikes an attractive balance between efficiency and luxury. So 
we drove on, dug deep into our quiver of hair-splitting tools and began to 
tally the notes.</p> 
<p><strong>$50,000 Is the New $40,000</strong><br>
 It is perhaps a sign of 
more than simple inflation that we can remember when coughing up $15,000 for an 
Audi 4000 seemed outrageous. Regardless, what we have here are three 
entry-level luxury sedans with base prices all starting at about $35,000. It's 
ironic that the Audi, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and provides 
the most sophisticated suspension configuration in the group, offers the lowest 
base price.</p> 
<p>But don't mistake these base prices for what you'll actually pay. The cost 
goes up very quickly from there &mdash; way up. In fact, this entry-level 3 
Series has been equipped as a showcase of BMW options, so our 328i tester tips 
the scales at a wage-crushing $50,745. Of course this fee includes some 
stupendous options, the most costly of which is the $3,600 Premium package. 
Also, there's the $2,550 Technology package and $2,500 Sport Line trim.</p> 
<p>Audi's A4 is the next most expensive car here, although its $45,675 bottom 
line is $5,070 less costly than the Bimmer. It also packs big-dollar options. 
The costliest is the $9,500 Prestige package, which hits home with goodies like 
MMI navigation, the Convenience package, heated front seats and a Bang &amp; 
Olufsen premium audio system.</p> 
<p>The 2012 Mercedes C250 is marginally more costly than the A4 at $45,900 
including the Premium and Multimedia packages.</p> 
<p><strong>The Economy/Power Compromise</strong><br>
 The ever-tightening 
noose of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) is no doubt responsible for 
shanghaiing two cylinders from this most established BMW model. The return is 
there, however, with EPA numbers offering a 5-mpg increase in combined fuel 
economy for the turbo-4 versus a normally aspirated inline-6 (27 mpg vs. 22 
mpg).</p> 
<p>What's more, BMW's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is 
rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp 
and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6. Our 
tester was fitted with the standard six-speed manual transmission. (An 
eight-speed automatic is a zero-cost option unless you opt for paddle shifters, 
which add $475.)</p> 
<p>But BMW isn't alone in introducing a four-cylinder power plant to this 
segment of premium sedans. The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250 is an all-new model 
created specifically to sip fuel in the most cost-effective way possible, even 
while surrounding its occupants in luxury. The Benz approach to this four is 
similar in concept to BMW, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter 
inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque. Only one transmission is 
available: a seven-speed automatic. The mix yields a 25-mpg combined rating 
from the EPA.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We might beat you to the next stoplight with the 328i, but we wouldn't 
fault you for your choice.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The 2012 Audi A4 has embraced four-cylinder power since the 1997 model, 
although this 2012 iteration utilizes turbocharging and direct fuel injection 
to produce 211 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque from a 2.0-liter four. Choose either 
the six-speed manual transmission &mdash; as in our tester &mdash; or the 
eight-speed automatic (a $1,300 premium) and you'll get all-wheel drive as 
standard equipment. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is available in 
front-drive models only. Six-speed shift-it-yourself A4s &mdash; like our test 
car &mdash; are rated at 25 mpg EPA combined.</p> 
<p><strong>Accelerate, Turn</strong><br>
 Nobody is buying the four-cylinder 
version of these cars for drag racing, but there's a reason you skipped 
directly to this section of the copy, isn't there? We'll make this simple: When 
it comes to drag racing, the right physics will win. And so does the 328i.</p> 
<p>At 3,427 pounds the BMW is 98 pounds lighter than the C250 and 235 pounds 
lighter than the A4. Combine these stats with a power advantage and the BMW is 
easily the quickest car here in a straight line. Even with the advantage of 
all-wheel drive during the launch, the A4 couldn't hold its edge in getaway 
quickness all the way to 60 mph.</p> 
<p>The 2012 BMW 328i sweeps both straight-line tests by hitting 60 mph in 5.9 
seconds (5.5 seconds using a1-foot rollout like on a drag strip) and passing 
through the quarter-mile in 14.1 seconds at 98.9 mph. The A4 is marginally 
slower to 60 mph at 6.2 seconds (5.9 seconds with rollout) and is a half-second 
back at the quarter-mile with an effort of 14.6 seconds at 94.1 mph. The Benz, 
hampered by its automatic transmission off the line, is slowest. Sixty mph 
arrives in 7.3 seconds (6.9 seconds with rollout) with all 1,320 feet passing 
in 15.3 seconds at 90.7 mph.</p> 
<p>It won't surprise anyone to know that the slowest car in the group earns 
the best fuel economy. The C250's 24.7 mpg came during 680 miles of mixed 
driving, but the 328i wasn't far behind at 23.6 mpg over 1,455 miles. At 21.6 
mpg over 684 miles, the all-wheel-drive Audi isn't as miserly.</p> 
<p>Objective handling tests, though, fall largely in favor of the Audi, which 
has the quickest slalom speed at 69.2 mph and best lateral acceleration at 
0.92g. As different as the BMW and Mercedes-Benz might seem in concept, the 
328i and C250 were much the same in these tests. The BMW recorded 66.7 mph in 
the slalom while the Benz reached 66.2 mph, and both pulled 0.88g around the 
skid pad.</p> 
<p>The Audi's superior grip showed itself again in our braking test, where it 
stopped from 60 mph in only 108 feet. The C250 and 328i recorded stops only 4 
feet and 7 feet longer, respectively.</p> 
<p><strong>Inside the Cabins</strong><br>
 With a 2-inch stretch, the 
wheelbase of the BMW 3 Series now measures 110.6 inches. This now gives the BMW 
parity with the Audi A4, which increased the length of its all-wheel-drive 
platform in 2009 in an effort to achieve handling dynamics more like a 
rear-wheel-drive car.</p> 
<p>The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250 has a wheelbase of 108.7 inches, and while the 
1.9-inch difference hardly makes this car small, it does translate into about 
an inch less rear legroom. If you're of average build, you'll have no trouble 
finding room in the back of the Benz. But if your vertical dimension pushes the 
6-foot mark, the missing inch will make a difference on longer trips. Also, the 
Benz offers the least headroom in the group by about a half inch.</p> 
<p>But the best interior in this group is not determined by space alone. By 
our estimation, the honor falls squarely to the Audi. Credit for this 
accomplishment goes to the S line Plus option package, which adds faux suede to 
the A4's standard leather on most critical seating surfaces. There are also 
brushed aluminum inlays and a black cloth headliner.</p> 
<p>When it comes to the interface for the cabin's electronic comfort and 
convenience features, the Audi gives up its leadership, as MMI is awkward to 
use relative to both BMW's iDrive and Mercedes' COMAND systems. All three 
systems integrate navigation, phone and audio controls into a menu-based 
knob-and-button interface, but Audi's system is less elegant and integrated in 
its design than the others.</p> 
<p><strong>Character Counts</strong><br>
 Perhaps the most defining trait of 
the Mercedes-Benz C250 is the simple, honest way it goes about every task. This 
sense of overbuilt purpose is a kind of DNA trickle-down from the small Benz's 
larger, heavier brethren, the E-Class and S-Class. Although the C-Class lacks 
the cruise-missile speed of those bigger cars, it delivers the same carefully 
controlled body motions when you're behind the wheel. The Benz also wins the 
timeless contest in door-slam quality with a heavily damped thud that sounds 
like Play Doh landing on bedrock.</p> 
<p>Of course, the downside to bedrock solidity is, in this case, a less 
engaging driving character. There's less athleticism in the C250 than either of 
the other cars, although the problem isn't so much the chassis as the 
powertrain. The automatic transmission is slow to respond and no complement to 
the least powerful engine in this group. A downshift, which requires a lateral 
slap of the shift lever on the console, slurs between gears with a throttle 
blip that's only marginally effective in speeding the process.</p> 
<p>The A4, which is the most controlled car here when tossed around, is 
downright snappy by comparison. There's less body roll, speedy response from 
the steering wheel and the most trusted and effective brake pedal in the group. 
Of course, you can forget about adjustments in cornering attitude from the 
chassis when you're in the middle of the corner, but these matter less when the 
other cars are already dots in the rearview mirror.</p> 
<p>The BMW doesn't inspire you to attack any back roads, but it offers a 
prudent degree of mountain-road-handling prowess to complement BMW's classic 
formula for all-around success. The new electrically assisted steering isn't 
communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either. 
The interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 Series 
with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it 
the best-looking car here.</p> 
<p><strong>It's All Relative</strong><br>
 It's the subjective, touchy-feely 
part of any comparison test that's always the hardest to assess. We have to ask
<em>why</em> the Audi handles best and <em>if</em> the Benz's anvil-like 
solidity is important. Such details ultimately define a car's character and 
then earn brand loyalty. We think they're important.</p> 
<p>So you should know, then, that part of the reason the Audi handles the best 
is because it's fitted with the widest, stickiest tires wrapped around the 
biggest, heaviest wheels. This is a product of the same optional S line Plus 
package that gives the A4 the interior detailing we love. The A4 is decidedly 
the most sporty-feeling sedan in the group as a result. And by &quot;sporty 
feeling&quot; we mean stiff, because the car's ride quality is compromised by 
this setup.</p> 
<p>Audi Drive Select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the 
big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper 
action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this 
A4's option package. The C250 also could have benefited from the optional 
$1,530 Dynamic Handling package, which adds adjustable dampers and a variable 
steering ratio to the C-Class, but it wasn't fitted to our test car.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the 328i included Driving Dynamics Control, BMW's own electronic 
overseer of throttle, steering and damping, and the optional adjustable dampers 
of the Adaptive M suspension certainly helped this 3 Series be all things to 
all people. No matter where we drove the BMW, we liked the experience, even if 
the car might have lacked a little something compared to either the Audi or 
Mercedes.</p> 
<p><strong>The Winner</strong><br>
 That we're giving the win in this contest 
to the 2012 BMW 328i is a product of its do-all abilities. The victory, though, 
comes with the caveat that your needs might demand other priorities better 
served by the supremely good Audi or Benz.</p> 
<p>All-weather ability, for example, might be necessary. If we lived in 
Colorado, we'd buy the 2012 Audi A4 and ditch the 19-inch wheels and tires in 
favor of a choice with lighter wheels and better-riding rubber. Or perhaps 
you're a sucker for the well-built refinement of the 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250, 
and we wouldn't fault you for your choice even if we might beat you to the next 
stoplight in the BMW.</p> 
<p>Truth is, you won't go wrong with any of these cars.</p> 
<p>Thanks to its options-gone-wild approach, this BMW 328i punches through the 
$50,000 barrier, which isn't something we take lightly in this segment. Still, 
we could option this car with more restraint and keep it competitive with the 
A4 and C250, and yet still lop nearly $6 grand from its sticker price. So 
equipped, the BMW 328i would still offer the ability to morph between agreeable 
freeway cruiser, efficient commuter and reasonably capable back-road companion 
better than its competition. It's this resourcefulness in combination with 
enduring quality that makes the 2012 BMW 328i so profoundly effective in this 
segment.</p> 
<p>And that's the case even when it's absent two historically important 
cylinders.</p> 
<p><em>The manufacturers provided Edmunds these vehicles for the purposes of 
evaluation.</em></p>

I saw the EPA report on the 3 series and was pretty 
surprised.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the EPA testing isn't for shit so I'll wait 
until I can drive mine to see what it really does.&nbsp;&nbsp;My 2000 BMW 323 
was EPA rated at 21/26 and I got 26-27 combined all of the time and almost 30 
on trips that were all highway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also drive a lot faster than the 
EPA (who don;t exceed 60 mph per their website).&nbsp;&nbsp;My current car is 
rated at 16/24 and I get 22-23 in very spirited mostly city driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
Just the fact that the 3 series 6 speed manual trans now gets better 
economy than the 8 speed auto is suspicous no matter what you think of the 
BMW.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, since early dyno testing of the BMW show it's hp to be 
understated, it makes it less likely that BMW would lie about the EPA 
numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, we'll have to see.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

I argued the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective

We already argued 
interior space and the BMW LITERALLY has 0.2 cu.ft more interior volume.<br>

<br>And I am not going to argue the gas mileage of a 3,600lb AWD car to a 
3,400lb RWD car.&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you just see how BMW lowered the EPA 
ratings for the 328i just yesterday... haha<br>

Again, you fail to actually read the article and you 
ignore the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The BMW was faster than the Audi.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
BMW looks better then the Audi (my opinion and the authors).&nbsp;&nbsp;The BMW 
rides better then the Audi.&nbsp;&nbsp;The BMW is bigger inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
BMW gets better fuel economy ( and don't bring up the numbers in test reviews 
because they all admit that they disable the start/stop feature and never run 
it in the economy mode).&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you limit the options on the BMW 
to match the Audi's price, the BMW is still the better all around 
car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

I am calling them biased because that SOLE fact you 
illustrated is seemingly why it won.<br>
As if people ONLY buy these cars for 
their 0-60 time.<br>
<br>
And from MT just last month;<br>
<br>
A4 - 5.8 to 60 
and 14.4 1/4<br>
328i - 5.6 to 60 and 14.2 1/4 <br>
<br>
And also from that 
test, for those of you who complained about the 19&quot; wheels/tires BMW 
doesn't offer, as if that is Audis fault for doing so and for thousands less 
too;<br>
<br>
A4 WITH 18&quot; wheels/tires - 0.91 g and 25.9 sec. figure-8<br>

328 WITH 18&quot; wheels/tires - 0.90 g and 25.9 sec. figure-8<br>
<br>
AND;<br>
A4 QUATTRO as tested mileage - 16.6mpg<br>
328i RWD as tested mileage - 16.8mpg 
RWD<br>
<br>
AND THAT Audi was almost $7,500 cheaper in that 
test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a hair over $43k.&nbsp;&nbsp;W/O the 19&quot; S-Line Plus 
which is only an option on the top-spec Prestige trim you save even more money 
over the 328i.<br>
<br>

coincidence in the numbers YOU posted...hehe<br>
2011 Audi A4 MT - 6.3 to 60<br>
2011 Audi A4 Tiptronic - 6.5 to 60<br>
2011 Audi A4 Multitronic- 7.0 to 60<br>

<br>AND, for 2012 Audi replaced the 6-Speed Tiptronic with an 8-Speed unit...

their way. For some reason , I'm not really even interested in test driving 
them , either.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For me , the older I get , it seems, I want 
less of the &quot;features&quot; - I don't want adaptable anything -steering, 
throttle response, dampening. I want it progressive ,direct, and adjustable w/ 
my right foot and hands. Ala the e36, e46, without the build 
quality,reliability issues.<br>
 Maybe the ATS will be the answer, time will 
tell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm with church123, I'll stick w/ my g37s 6mt sedan for 
now.I'm happy w/ 21mpg mixed and solid reliability.</p> Report ItReport It <br>

I was playing devils advocate.&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount 
of physics would explain why, given the information I presented, the GT-R would 
be faster than the R8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course things like gearing, and drivetrain 
loss, and what have you will effect it but my point is that church doesn't know 
that information either.&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know how much power each car is 
putting to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know the gear ratios of each cars 
transmission, etc.<br>
<br>
I am NOT ignoring Audis wheel/tire 
setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact is that both cars are 100% equipped meaning the BMW 
doesn't come with high performance 19&quot; wheels/tires.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is 
BMW's fault, not Audis.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Audi STILL costs $5k less WITH the 
higher performance 19&quot; wheels/tires AND the addition of AWD with 
comparable equipment/features.<br>
<br>
And secondly, you say the BMW won 
because it is a better car.<br>
<br>
All it does better, according to this 
test, is get to 60mph and through the 1/4 5% faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT IS 
IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it costs $5k MORE in doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read all the 
specs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audi was better in every 
single other way.&nbsp;&nbsp;It handles better, brakes better, has a nicer 
interior (so says I/L), has equal or more features, and costs $5k+ LESS WITH 
the addition of AWD.<br>
<br>
The BMW won because it is a BMW.<br>
<br>
I AM 
not ignoring gas mileage either because it is unfair to compare the 21.7 mpg 
figure for the 3,662 lb AWD Audi with the 23.7 mpg figure of the 3,427 lb RWD 
BMW...<br>
<br>
You guys take this crap as if what I/L&nbsp;&nbsp;says 
matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have biases too.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than we do because 
they actually get paid to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because they prefer the BMW 
to the Audi doesn't mean the BMW is a better car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does it mean 
it is a worse car either.<br>
<br>
But just as most others have noted in their 
comments on this comparo..&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audi should have won.</p> Report It

<p>1st Place: 2012 BMW 328i</p> The most powerful and best all-around driving 
car here, the 328i also offers a sublime mix of efficiency and luxury.
<p>2nd Place: 2012 Audi A4</p> Standout handling, interior quality and an AWD 
powertrain make the A4 unique, but they don't make it better than the 328i.
<p>3rd Place: 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250</p> Less capable as a driver's car, but 
bedrock-solid build quality and trickle-down driving character from its larger 
siblings make the C250 a solid choice.

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments <br>
Acceleration comments Rev-limited to 
3,800 with ESC on; no limit (below redline) when it's off. Seems relatively 
indifferent to launch technique -- only a few hundredths of a second separate 
clutch dump from careful modulation by 60 mph. Shifter is less likable when 
rushed in this environment. Engine is done at 6,500. <br>
Braking comments 
Confident pedal every stop, but fade (+6 feet) present. Not the best braking in 
the segment. <br>
Handling comments Skid pad: Heavy steering with quite good 
communication at the limit. More body roll than expected makes sensing grip 
limits more difficult. Still, good balance. Adjustable, but slower to respond 
than I'd prefer. Slalom: Ample body roll makes quick transitions feel awkward. 
Even so, limits are reasonably well defined. Excellent ESC produces quickest 
slalom time by 0.01 second. <br>

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments <br>
Acceleration comments Never felt like I 
got a great launch, but the 0-60 time is quicker than Audi estimates for this 
car. Feel like there's some mechanical (clutch damper?) demons serving to 
protect the A4's drivetrain from this kind of behavior. Once under way, the 
power deficit vs. the BMW is obvious. Also, like the 328i, the engine is done 
revving by 6,000 rpm. <br>
Braking comments Best brake feel and performance in 
the group. Solid, consistent pedal. Short stops. <br>
Handling comments Skid 
pad: This car's tire advantage is obvious in our handling tests. Despite heavy, 
non-adjustable understeer at the limit, it sticks at 0.92g., which is serious 
for any sport sedan. Slalom: Being stiffly sprung and possessing ample roll 
stiffness genuinely helps the A4 in rapid transitions. Its understeering 
attitude is also predictably quick here. <br>

Test Driver Ratings &amp; Comments <br>
Acceleration 
comments Once on boost the C250's acceleration is adequate, but it still lacks 
the punch of the Audi and BMW. Also, the transmission feels behind the times. 
No paddles. No rev matching. Not good. <br>
Braking comments Good feel and 
performance (beats 328i). Also, more consistent than BMW. <br>
Handling comments
Non-defeat ESC makes its presence known in both tests. Steering doesn't build 
confidence as limits approach. Balance, too, isn't spectacular around skid pad. 
Slalom: Snakes between the cones with good stability (thanks, ESC), but doesn't 
inspire me to push harder once ESC activates. Safe and consiststent and easy, 
but less &quot;sports&quot; sedan than the others. <br>
