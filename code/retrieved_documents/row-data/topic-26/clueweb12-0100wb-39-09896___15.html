<h1>2012 Detroit: Lincoln MKZ Concept is Latest Brand-Changing Car</h1>

<p>Ford Group VP Jim Farley and Lincoln design chief Max Wolff pulled the 
wraps off the new Lincoln MKZ Concept today in Cobo Hall. The MKZ Concept 
previews Lincoln&rsquo;s new design direction as it looks to snag young buyers 
away from the &ldquo;efficient but soulless&rdquo; German luxury manufacturers.
</p> 
<p>The Lincoln MKZ Concept is a real big deal for Lincoln. As its best seller, 
Lincoln can&rsquo;t afford to make the MKZ &lsquo;just&rsquo; a rebadged Ford 
Fusion. If the MKZ Concept is any indication it looks as if Lincoln is finally 
readying to step out on its own.</p> 
<p>While it still shares its chassis and architecture with the Fusion, the MKZ 
Concept takes a decidedly different approach. Where the Fusion looks like an
Aston Martin midsize sedan with a loud front end, large haunches and flared 
wheel arches, the MKZ Concept goes for a more subdued, refined look.</p> 
<p>Up front, the MKZ Concept takes Lincoln&rsquo;s current waterfall grille 
and turns it 90 degrees, letting it flow into the new LED headlights. Lincoln 
takes a page out of Audi andMercedes-Benz&rsquo;s playbook for the MKZ 
Concept&rsquo;s profile, which is almost coupe-like with a long sweeping 
roofline. Speaking of which, Lincoln went for a full-length panoramic glass 
roof for the MKZ Concept that visually flows from the car&rsquo;s hood line to 
the trunk lid.</p> 
<p>The MKZ Concept&rsquo;s interior, like the exterior, is elegant and 
contemporary; it gets attractive looking aluminum and recycled Poplar trim, and 
is bathed in champagne-colored leather that contrasts nicely with the brown 
dashboard. The interior also gets MyLincoln Touch, and a large LCD screen that 
functions as the MKZ&rsquo;s instrument panel. The neatest interior touch 
though would have to be the MKZ Concept&rsquo;s push-button transmission. Sure 
it&rsquo;s gimmicky, but if Jaguar can have a rotary shifter, why can&rsquo;t 
Lincoln do push-button?</p> 
<p>Engine availability is currently unknown but rumor has it the next Lincoln 
MKZ may get a 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 that won&rsquo;t be seen in any other Ford 
products, in addition to the 1.6 and 2.0-liter Ecoboosts, and the 2.0-liter 
hybrid version.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually impressed by the interior&hellip;..The center dash is 
very clean and brightly lit enough. The steering wheel is very modern. As this 
is a concept it&rsquo;s too bad none of the design features will be put into 
it. Instead it&rsquo;ll be watered down, plasticky, hard feeling and very bland 
just like the current MKS. And it has no wood trim on it to speak of unless 
that&rsquo;s dark wood I&rsquo;m looking at.</p> <br>

<p>how do you know that none of the design features will be put into the 
production version? it looks modern but not so modern that it would look out of 
place in the current car market. i think that there is probably a good chance 
of the production version looking very similar.</p> <br>

<p>If they can do something about the grill ( maybe look at a &rsquo;71 or 
&rsquo;72 Continental for inspiration) this has the potential to be the first 
hit for Lincoln in a long,long time !</p> <br>

<p>HUGE improvement over the current model, bring it to production with no 
change to the looks. It&rsquo;s about time Ford put some effort into Lincoln.

<p>I love it. It actually does remind me of the Lincolns from the 90&prime;s 
with the bar taillights. The back end and overall shape of the car are awesome. 
The front end could use some work, but I think it looks a lot like the Audi A7 
which is definitely a good thing. I hope they fix the front end, though. 
That&rsquo;s really this car&rsquo;s downfall, along with the previous engine 
choices.</p> <br>

<li> bhak1 Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;11:17 am Reply <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s overall an improvement (although I do like the vertical grille 
slots better), but the question remains: Why would I get this over a G37, 
C-Class or CTS? For that matter, why get this over a Regal, 300 or TSX? It 
looks like a good car, but it doesn&rsquo;t jump out at me as being better than 
the competition.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> 92Vectra1.6i Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;12:13 pm Reply <br>

<p>This is competition for the fwd ES350 and LaCrosse , not any of the cars 
you listed (with the possible exception of the TSX). The primary considerations 
are a smooth ride and luxurious interior.</p> <br>

<p>more choices the better.. hopefully Ford will fix the face..</p> <br>

<p>i think it still looks too subdued and fat. lincoln needs to be bold, 
which, aside from the head and taillights (which probably won&rsquo;t make 
production), it IS NOT.</p> 
<p>this looks more like the current Fusion than the next generation of Fusion 
does&hellip;<br>
 and without a sense of scale it looks fat and huge, like 
it&rsquo;s based on the Taurus instead&hellip;</p> 
<p>Ford is doing well with FORD, but just because you upscale some of the 
materials and give it slightly different sheetmetal does not mean you can call 
it luxury and compete with the likes of MB or BMW, or even Cadillac.<br>
 
CHRYSLER is doing better with the 300 than Lincoln is on track to do with the 
MKZ&hellip;<br>
 and I can&rsquo;t look at a 300 and think &ldquo;oh yea, i see 
where there&rsquo;s a Charger under there&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
 and even if I 
could, the Charger is a much better base for a luxury car than a Fusion&hellip;
</p> <br>

<p>right now, i would put Lincoln on par with Buick, which I don&rsquo;t think 
is where Ford wants it. Buick&rsquo;s cars at least have their own style, which 
is very different from anything else GM sells here.</p> 
<p>I do like the glass roof, interior, and taillights. they&rsquo;re steps in 
the right direction, but just not enough to win my affection for the car or the 
brand&hellip;</p> <br>

<li> 92Vectra1.6i Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;12:15 pm Reply <br>

<p>This is based on the European Mondeo, not the Fusion (which is based on the 
first generation Mazda6).</p> <br>

<p>OK I like this design it is crisp and fluid and beautiful&hellip;.. Listen 
to me Chris, Lincoln does NOT employ 4 cylinder nothing motors in there cars 
why? because they are pipsqeek nothing motors that dull down the brand and dum 
down the image of whos gonna buy these cars &ndash; they are going to want 
POWER son&hellip; they are going to want the kind of power the brand has been 
known for &hellip;. im no freek motorhead but i do know this brand Chris and if 
your thinking its ok to stick a 4 cylinder inside of a Lincoln, please leave 
your post and let someone that truly understands Lincoln and what we all 
percieve it to be!!</p> <br>

<p>Again I ask. Was selling Jaguar a mistake? Lincoln is making a lot of 
effort to improve its vehicles. But when you look at how much more work they 
need and how far Jaguar and Land Rover have come in such a short time, I 
question if the 2bil they received by selling Jag is pennies compared to how 
much they will spend fixing Lincoln</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> bhak1 Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;11:13 am Reply <br>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I would even say that they could&rsquo;ve ditch 
Jag and kept Volvo but either way, keep a proven and popular upscale brand that 
is clearly different from Ford. Same goes with breaking up with Mazda. Mazda 
was the answer to the Mercury problem. An everyman&rsquo;s car for people that 
weren&rsquo;t into Ford, but they ditched that too and vainly tried to revamp 
Mercury before letting that go. As great at the Ford brand itself has become, 
they seem completely lost on their sub brands.</p> <br>

<p>I appreciate Ford&rsquo;s effort to steal the look of a nice looking car by 
pasting on the Hyundai Sonata&rsquo;s front end to this car. The rest of the 
car is still hideous. If this is what Lincoln is going to do, they might as 
well keep the Ford sheetmetal.</p> <br>

<p>I think that it&acute;s a huge improvement over the current mkz, the grill 
looks way better and for the first time it doesn&acute;t look just like another 
Fusion&acute;s trim level. The main problem with mkz is that the next Fusion is 
the looker. If I had to pick one I would get the Fusion over the mkz just in 
style.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m reaching the point where the rest of the cars that I buy will be 
the upscale models. Aka Caddy, Infiniti, Lexus, Lincoln and Buick instead of 
Chevy, Nissan, Toyota, and Ford(exceptions being sports cars) But it is just 
like Toycrusher said Lincoln is just a mildly polished Ford, and it&rsquo;s 
like they say, you can&rsquo;t polish a turd!</p> 
<p>My In-Laws have a last year Merc Mountaineer, and a 2010 MKX and my wifes 
older Hyundia Veracruz is hands down much classier. More soft touch materials 
for less money. Ford doesn&rsquo;t put the effort into proper upscale products 
unless its another version the Mustang or F-150.</p> <br>

MKZ, and the MKS look great, and the I like the grille on the MKT as well!</p>

<p>Yeah, thats basically what luxury cars are pal. What the fuck do you want 
Ford to do, develop a unique platform for every Lincoln model?</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln and Acura seem to be stuck in design hell. What happened to simple 
designs like the 2006 Zephyr or the Integra, why do they keep making fugly 
designs? They are not boring like Lexus they are hideous!</p> 
<p>At least Ford has their core brand not looking horrid like Honda currently 
does. Come on Ford do something with Lincoln or kill them off. Or 
maybe&hellip;.Ford should have killed Lincoln and just moved Mercury further 
upscale. Though I suppose there will always be a gap between a brand like ford 
or GM that do not specialize in luxo but only offer it as a option; they will 
always be somewhat watered down compared to their German competitors. The 
Cadillac CTS-V excluded from that last comment.</p> <br>

<p>Of all the constant complaints about Lincoln, I have yet to hear what 
everyone really wants from them &hellip;. and the constant references to 
Lincoln&rsquo;s past &hellip;. what era are you talking about? Lincoln&rsquo;s 
had a few great cars thoughout its history &hellip;.but the current lineup, 
even if you don&rsquo;t like their style, is by far the best. If you really 
think Lincoln should build nothing but large, RWD cars, then I believe you 
really would see its demise.</p> 
<p>Having said that, I think this is a great step forward for Lincoln 
&hellip;.while I would agree that the FUSION may be the better looking car, 
this one is far more interesting (in a good way) to look at.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s wait and see what the production version looks like before we 
hand down judgment.</p> <br>

<p>A car almost as tall as most CUVs, 60 inches, and not much better looking 
is ridiculous. The still can&rsquo;t the grille right and they seemingly have 
no plans for a RWD halo vehicle for this brand. In addition, they seem 
incapable of coming up with names for their cars instead of letters. I&rsquo;m 
sorry but it looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a wasted $1 billion dollars.</p>

<p>Trevster and all the other people like you, why are you guys giving Lincoln 
so much hassle about giving &ldquo;real names&rdquo; to there cars, but you 
don&rsquo;t say the same to Cadillac, Audi, Acura, Mercedes, Infiniti, BMW, and 
other luxury companies a may or may not have missed? The only Luxury companies 
using real names instead of letter/number named cars are the hyper luxury 
companies Bentley and Rolls Royce , so please people stop ragging on Lincoln 
unless your going to rag on every luxury car company out there!</p> <br>

<p>BAD MOVE LINCOLN &ndash; AS SOMEONE ALREADY SAID A REALLY BAD CADILLAC 
CLONE &ndash; PUSH BUTTON SHIFTING? WHY????? NO THANKS</p> <br>

<p>Push-button shifter sounds boring, but it looks great on that console. More 
importantly I bet that freed up real estate of the usual shifter area will be 
much handier than it looks. Thay can bring back the front bench seat too!</p>

<p>It looks good in a generic way. It&rsquo;s taut and modern but Lincoln 
still can&rsquo;t find a charismatic and recognizable style direction. It could 
very well be the next Hyundai Genesis. However, the interior looks great and 
production ready.</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> Toycrusher Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;6:41 am Reply <br>

<p>Um, I thought Ford was going to turn Lincoln around? Unfortunately, this is 
another half-baked attempt in a long series from Lincoln. It&rsquo;s instantly 
recognizable as a Fusion clone. What&rsquo;s worse, they took a page out of the 
CTS book for their interior design. No thanks.</p> 
<p>Anybody notice Ford and GM are very different? GM releases new platforms on 
their flagship models like Caddy or Corvette, and then trickles it down to 
their Chevy line-up. Ford releases big changes to their Ford line-up, and then 
tries to upsell it to Lincoln when everybody already knows they can get the 
same tech for thousands less by buying a Ford. By the looks of Lincoln&rsquo;s 
sales numbers, GM has the better approach.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Michael Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;7:14 am Reply <br>

<p>GM built the Saab 9-3 on the Opel Vectra platform. Or the Chevy 
Tahoe/Cadillac Escalade. But in general you are right. You should never make a 
silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> bhak1 Posted on: January 10, 2012&nbsp;11:05 am Reply <br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s instantly recognizable as a Fusion clone, 
but from the profile I did notice it. Although none of us are yet all that 
familiar with the new Fusion as it just came out yesterday so it could become 
more apparent when we see them on the road daily.</p> 
<p>Interesting point about the GM vs Ford school of platform sharing. I think 
Caddy got away with it on the Escalade largely because Lincoln got away with it 
on the Navigator&hellip; If I remember correctly the Navigator was a smash with 
pro athletes, actors and rappers and then everyone else wanted one&hellip; 
including GM. There&rsquo;s something to be said for a car getting that kind of 
attention, I think it did quite a bit for the 300 as well. But these new 
Lincolns&hellip;. I just don&rsquo;t see that happening.</p> <br>

<p>Looks very good, I love the fastback side profile and the front is very 
elegant in the closeup shots. Interior looks very production-ready. Let&rsquo;s 
hope nothing gets lost in translation.</p> <br>

<p>I am a huge Ford guy and love the direction that the Ford brand has been 
going; it seems like they just cant miss lately. That said, I dont like the way 
that Lincoln is headed. I had high hopes for their new direction. If this is it 
I guess its going to be another 6 years (next major change in design) of 
waiting for something worth getting, if Lincoln can survive that long. I can 
see glimmers of good in this design, I hope they keep those and shed the other 
95% of the design.</p> <br>
