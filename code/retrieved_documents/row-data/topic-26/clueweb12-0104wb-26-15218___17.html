<li>Running Costs?</li> 
<li>What to look for?</li> </ul> 
<h1>What's it like?</h1> 
<p>Despite looking like an all-new car, this model is a heavily revised 
version of the earlier A4 (2000-2004). It's slightly bigger inside, but 
dynamically very similar. With precise handling and good roadholding, the Audi 
is entertaining to drive, and unsettled by only the bumpiest surfaces. It grips 
well and turns into corners crisply, and rides comfortably over most surfaces. 
Although the Audi ultimately falls short of the BMW 3 Series for driver 
enjoyment, it's perfectly acceptable. This A4 retains Audi's tradition for 
clarity, quality and comfort inside the cabin. Controls are logically laid out 
and feel durable, and four people can sit in comfort. However, five will 
struggle due to the bulk of the transmission tunnel. Wind and tyre noise are 
kept in check.</p> <br>

<h1>Which one should I get?</h1> 
<p>Go for the 2.0 TDI engine, which is smoother than the 1.9-litre diesel 
option. You get 138bhp and an average of 47.9mpg. Large diesels comprise 
2.5-litre, 2.7-litre and a 3.0-litre V6s Diesel models have better residual 
values, but if you want a petrol car the turbo-charged 2.0-litre FSI engine is 
a sensible choice. Avoid the underpowered 1.6-litre model, but the 1.8 turbo 
model is worth considering. The 3.2-litre petrol-engined version is rare and 
not that exciting, as opposed to the 4.2-litre which produces up to 414bhp, and 
rivals BMW's M3. The more powerful versions of the A4 come with four-wheel 
drive, which noticeably improves traction but lowers fuel economy. The 
entry-level trim (unnamed) is poorly equipped, so opt for the mid-level SE with 
four electric windows and a CD player. The S-line model comes with sportier 
trim, seats and detailing. An early version of Audi's Multi-Media Interface 
(MMI) is a desirable option, and like BMW's iDrive, lets you control the radio, 
CD player, ventilation system and sat nav.</p> <br>

<h1>What are the running costs?</h1> 
<p>The A4 is cheaper to own than to rivals, taking depreciation into account, 
and should prove as reliable. Main dealers have a reputation for higher prices, 
but stick to independent specialists and you can cut up to 35% off your service 
bills. However, franchised dealers can use this as an excuse to undervalue your 
car, so be wary when getting newer cars serviced. The 2.0-litre diesels are 
popular with fleet buyers because of their economy and low group 12 insurance 
rating. The petrol 2.0T FSI does 36.7mpg and is the more-expensive insurance 
group 15, so residual values aren't as strong as a result. The 4.2-litre models 
may have the performance of junior supercars, but running costs will reflect 
this, with an insurance group rating of 20, a special servicing schedule and 
only 20mpg. For cars out of warranty, the average repair bill works out to 
roughly &pound;330 according to Warranty Direct.</p> 
<h1>What should I look out for?</h1> 
<p>Generally this generation of A4 is reliable, but there are some issues. The 
2.0-litre diesel models can burn oil over time and some owners don't check the 
level, relying instead on the oil warning light. This is dangerous, and could 
cause permanent engine damage. Consult the service book to find out when the 
oil was last changed, and then check the dipstick to see if it's low. The 
central locking can fail, and dealers aren't always able to fix it quickly. 
Check that all the doors unlock, and that the remote is working correctly. 
Although generally well built, some A4s have gloveboxes and dashboards that 
rattle or squeak. A test drive should expose any faults. Problems changing 
gear, as well as very stiff clutches, are early signs of a known gearbox 
problem. During a test drive, ensure you can select every gear easily. Audi has 
been known to contribute to the cost of repairing some cars out of warranty, so 
you shouldn't expect to pay for fixing cars that are less than three years old.
