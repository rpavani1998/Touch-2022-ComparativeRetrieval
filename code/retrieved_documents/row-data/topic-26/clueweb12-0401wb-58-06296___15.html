<p>Born-and-raised American luxury can arguably be summed up in two names: 
Lincoln and Cadillac. Each is bred from a major automaker hoping to provide an 
avenue for their loyal buyers to aspire to.</p> 
<p><b>So which do you prefer? Why? </b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b>If neither of these, what&rsquo;s your favorite American luxury brand?

<p>Is this SERIOUSLY even a question ? Cadillac, duh. President&rsquo;s car 
and the biggest, most powerful american luxury brand.</p> <br>

<p>2011 Lincoln&rsquo;s are very nice cars, but I go for Cadillac, Why, 
because Cadillac is produces great looking cars and is the only American luxury 
brand that is a huge rival towards Lexus, Infiniti and BMW</p> <br>

<p>Why are we comparing Cadillacs to Lincolns? Cadillas are the way to go, 
I&rsquo;d never buy a Lincoln (where&rsquo;s the luxury?). But, shouldn&rsquo;t 
we be comparing Lincolns to Buicks? That&rsquo;s closer to Lincolns luxury. And 
Buick is definitely the winner.</p> <br>

<p>The old Lincoln. I own a Mark VIII which may as well be a luxo Mustang 
Cobra with automatic. It has the same 32 valve V8. And the power too!</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac is arguably the builder of more competitive luxury vehicles, but I 
personally like Lincoln vehicles more. There is something about the Town 
Car&rsquo;s refusal to die that makes it such an awesome reminder of what 
American luxury once was.However, both of these companies pale in comparison to 
the ultimate king of American luxury, PACKARD. Even though they are no longer 
around, Packard cars were the last word in luxury. If they still existed today, 
it would be obvious who was the best.</p> <br>

<p>I like too much the Lincoln LS, too bad was discontinued.Navigator i like 
too, but today, the products of Cadillac are far better.In the old times 
Cadillac was a step behind Licoln and his Continental four door 
convertible.Panhard was the best, with superior enginnering, finish trim levels

<p>Cadillacs were the Standard of The World. They were always ahead of 
Lincoln; for example the fins in cadillac . They were the first to put them in 
their cars and they were copied by every other luxury brand. So, Cadillac is 
not the standard of the world, but by 2017 they will have a full line up of 
pure luxury cars. Then their title will remain true.</p> <br>

<p>I like both. The CTS is sexy as hell, especially the coupe. But the MKS is 
also quite a looker. Pound for pound if I was going to buy one or the other 
I&rsquo;d buy the Cadillac. But I wish both Lincoln and Cadillac the best in 
there come backs.</p> <br>

<p>Until Lincoln offers rear wheel drive products, V-8&prime;s, and a 500 plus 
horsepower supersedan they will never be in the same league as Cadillac or any 
other luxury car maker&rsquo;s for that matter.</p> <br>

<p>I go with Lincoln. Why? I saw a 75th Diamond Jubilee anniversary Lincoln 
Continental (It was Late &rsquo;70&prime;s), and it was an awesome looking 
car.I know, Caddy seems to be doing better, but Lincoln is making a come back, 
one that I like more so than Cadillac. The new MKZ is suppose to be good, and 
if the Fusion is any indication of it, I have my faith in Lincoln.</p> <br>

<p>By the way guys LINCOLN&rsquo;S ARE NOT REBAGED FORDS!! Just look at the 
interior of a FORD, then look at the interior of a LINCOLN! The interior of the 
LINCOLN has a much higher QUALITY of materials and COMFORT! If you say LINCOLN 
is a REBAGED FORD, then LIKEWISE CADILLAC is a REBAGED CHEVROLET!!!!!</p> <br>

<p>I like both LINCOLN and CADILLAC!!BUT when it comes to making a choice, I 
will always choose LINCOLN!! Because LINCOLN DESIGNERS and ENGINEERS research 
the automotive LUXURY market and design their cars to meet what the customer is 
looking for in a LUXURY CAR or a LUXURY CROSSOVER!! Also FORD and LINCOLN take 
their time to make sure they get it right on every new model they introduce! An 
excellent example of this is the new 2010 LINCOLN MKZ and the new TOP OF THE 
LINE FLAGSHIP THE 2010 LINCOLN MKT!! FORD and LINCOLN/MERCURY are now VERY 
SERIOUS about DEVELOPING and PRODUCING CARS AND TRUCKS with HIGH FUEL MILAGE 
AND STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY along with VERY HIGH QUALITY!! CADILLAC is also 
building HIGH QUALITY CARS and SUV&rsquo;S, BUT CADILLAC also thinks they have 
to build HIGH HORSE POWER HIGH PERFOMANCE cars like the 6.2L 556 H.P.CTS-V 
series! LINCOLN has developed the LINCOLN C CONCEPT with a 1.6L EcoBoost that 
averages 43 MPG on the highway!! CADILLAC so far does NOT have even a CONCEPT 
that matches this! Also I feel that LINCOLN has built HIGHER QUALITY CARS AND 
SUV&rsquo;S than CADILLAC for many years ! I plan to buy the new 2010 LINCOLN 
MKT this year!</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln was made simply to be profitable (explained by mass sub-luxury 
platform sharing) Cadillac was recreated to recapture the soul of American 
luxury.Caddy&rsquo;s aim is to once again be the luxury standard of the world 
like it was 60yrs ago. They&rsquo;re not in the same league, at least not 
anymore. Sit inside the MKS and CTS and they&rsquo;re a world apart in terms of 
quality, functionality and fit and finish. Drive them and the differences get 
even greater. I like the MKS but admittedly it just doesn&rsquo;t compare.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say. Cadillac has the rwd platform to it&rsquo;s 
advantage, imho. It&rsquo;s got the CTS, and will possibly have ATS,and I think 
the XTS. It also has the 3.6 DI V6. Lincoln has theMKZ, MKX and the upcoming 
MKT. It&rsquo;ll have, I think it&rsquo;s right,a 3.6 DI V6 competitor. It also 
has the option of awd, thenagain, so does Cadillac, I think. Gotta look it up. 
So it reallyis a toss up.</p> <br>

<p>Hey Shelby- the G8 and the CTS are not built on the same platform. CTS is 
Sigma, american designed. G8 is autralian, developed 7000 miles away.Anyways, I 
have to say Caddy, both cause i prefer Cadillac, and because Lincoln no longer 
makes Lincoln. They are trying to build American Acuras as far as i can tell. 
All gadgets. Sounds more like an Edsel to me. I think lincoln should take that 
old Crown Vic platform back out, and keep making nice american boats. They may 
not be fast or handle well, but they are by far one of the best rides i have 
ever experienced.</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac all the way. I agree that Caddillac has a more uniqueness to their 
vehicles, but even though Lincoln is a badge engineered for, they are well 
done. When I see a Lincoln MKS, I see a Lincoln MKS not a Taurus. That is one 
of the best looking cars on the road. Plus, Lincoln can only get better. Again 
the MKS and MKZ are examples. I would by an MKS if I had the money, thats all I 
know.</p> <br>

<p>If it&rsquo;s a choice between only those two marques, I choose Cadillac. 
Caddy has done a marvelous job of reinventing itself and now makes really 
world-class luxury cars. Lincoln is trying really hard, but isn&rsquo;t quite 
there yet.</p> <br>

<p>it is cadillac without a question. they look the part and have the kind of 
engines u would pay that money for. the lincoln&rsquo;s are just ugly and 
ackward looking. i&rsquo;m sure they are nice with ford making such a big 
turnaround, but i just look at them and wonder who would pay for something that 
looks that cheap.</p> <br>

<p>I do love the CTS-V but what else does Cadillac have? They have dated 
Escalades and a fancy pants Chevy Equinox.Lincoln has a brand new MKZ, MKS, MKT 
and coming soon a refreshed MKX, which are every bit if not better than 90% of 
what is coming out of Japan. Hell, the new Taurus is nicer than most Acuras. 
When it comes to quality and luxury the winner is Lincoln hands down. Style is 
debatable, but then again, Cadillac only has one car.</p> <br>

<p>Until Caddy brings out its new upcoming lineup, it can&rsquo;t compete Merc 
or BMW. The DTS is not a true competitor to the S Class or 7 Series. The CTS 
and its variants are the only things holding up Daddy&rsquo;s image. They 
allowed the STS and XLR to languish. Who knows how good they could have become 
had they gone into their 2nd generation. Just look at the difference the CTS 
went through.</p> <br>

<p>First of all: Microsoft Sync is one of the best infotainment systems out 
there. Motor Trend said the Lincoln MKT had a better interior than an Audi (you 
know the brand that wins the number one interior every single year). Lincoln 
and Cadillac appeal to different consumers. Lincoln competes with Lexus, Acura, 
Mercedes and sometimes Buick. Cadillac competes with BMW, Audi, and Infiniti. 
I&rsquo;ll take a MKZ with Ecoboost next year.</p> <br>

<p>Caddilac easily&hellip;Lincoln vs. Buick might get Lincoln a few more votes 
but it&rsquo;d still lose that comparison too IMO. But Lincoln belongs in the 
entry lux market (Chrysler, Buick, Acura, Lexus, Infiniti, Volvo) not in the 
mid lux market (BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes, Cadillac, Audi)</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac all the way! lincoln has basically failed, until recentely but 
that is rather debatable. Cadillac has been using its hairatage for a long 
time, and giving it a modern twist. perfect example the tailfins! cadillacs are 
just plane hot!</p> <br>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at some of the responses on this thread.. 
especially the claim that one of you would rather have any Lincoln over any 
Lexus, infiniti, or acura. I might give you the new acura&rsquo;s are ugly, but 
they are in a completely different league of mechanics, reliability and driving 
experience. Nothing lincoln makes, or has ever made comes close to a G37 or 
M35/45. lexus&rsquo; may be boring, they are worlds more luxurious than any 
lincoln and are actually worth something when you trade them in. That being 
said, Caddy wins this challenge by a landslide. The CTS-V is one of maybe 5 or 
6 American cars actually worth spending hard earned money on.</p> <br>

<p>I like what they&rsquo;re both doing, however, Cadillac has been in the 
process of reinventing itself ever since the CTS came out in 2002. It seems 
like Lincoln has only recently started its own reinvention. And it definitely 
shows in the products. While Lincoln&rsquo;s are fine luxury cars, 
they&rsquo;re still not quite up there on the level of Cadillac. I do believe 
that Lincoln is only a year or 2 from getting up there. Right now Cadillac 
competes with BMW, Audi, and Mercedes Benz. The more personal performance 
luxury cars. Lincoln currently (In My Opinion) competes with Lexus, Acura, 
Infiniti, and Acura. The family oriented/non-performance luxury cars. And (In 
My Opinion) beats all of them.In the mainstream marketplace, Cadillac once 
again gets respect when in competition with Europe&rsquo;s best (BMW, Mercedes, 
Audi). Lincoln does not yet get the same amount of respect. But it will 
soon.I&rsquo;d definitely take any Lincoln over any Lexus, Infiniti, or Honda 
whoops I mean Acura.But I still prefer Cadillac for its performance, interior 
and exterior design, and its uniqueness. Like one of the other posts said, 
let&rsquo;s see a thread regarding the entry luxury cars (Buick, Chrysler, and 
Mercury).</p> <br>

<p>I used to prefer Lincoln over Cadillac, but not anymore. They now use 
mostly fwd platforms, which is a questionable decision given that they want to 
compete in the luxury market.Cadillac became one of my favorite manufacturers 
of all time when they put out the CTS. It&rsquo;s hard to not like GM these 
days, when they&rsquo;re putting out real driver&rsquo;s cars like the G8 and 
CTS. Too bad some dumbass decided to close pontiac.</p> <br>

<p>@Anonymous Person,Now you say nothing beats a V-8 and stuff, but what will 
happen when CAFE bumps up the mpg for each company again? Cadillac would say 
dang we should of done this a lot sooner. What Ford MoCo is doing now is taking 
technology that&rsquo;s available now and implementing it in their product. 
What that would do is only make room for improvements to the Ecoboost in the 
future models, that way Ford MoCo will be years ahead of the competition while 
GM will be at the starting line.</p> <br>

<p>As a Ford fan, I&rsquo;m really pushing for Lincoln. However, Cadillacs 
upcoming lineup with a true 3-Series fighter would give Cadillac some real 
depth rather than just being the CTS. The Super-Epsilon Caddy flagship 
won&rsquo;t be RWD as most wanted but in the time being if done right might be 
able to bring some true luxury to Caddy (soft ride a la S-Class and LS). 
Lincoln&rsquo;s lineup now is better organized in terms of design and mission 
but I would like to see at least one RWD performance based sedan and coupe.</p>

<p>Cadillac CTS makes the Cadillac brand. Lincoln makes some sharp looking 
cars like the MKS, but lacks the sporty driving characteristics that I prefer 
over &ldquo;soft&rdquo; luxury.</p> <br>

<p>im going to have to go with Cadillac. Cadillac continues to push design to 
a new level with each new vehicle. And to me, Cadillac is really the only true 
American Luxury brand, Lincoln to me is more like a premium brand that more 
competes with Buick.</p> <br>

<p>I love Cadillacs. The new style is not only bold &ndash; a nice departure 
from the herd &ndash; but gets better with every new model. And yet it still 
says &ldquo;Cadillac.&rdquo; The American tailfin has evolved, but lives! Even 
the current DTS looks great &ndash; a very nice job (though not the most 
up-to-date model, of course.)And. They seem to be quite rewarding to drive, as 
well. Not so long ago, Cadillac wasn&rsquo;t exactly thought of as competitive. 
But they are back.</p> <br>

<p>@Anonymous Person,Calm down man,Wow your defensive, both vehicles appeal to 
different demographs, and if you&rsquo;ve seriously looked at the new lincolns, 
you&rsquo;d realize what FoMoCofan and I are talking about. As he said, 
Lincolns approach is very similar to that of Audi&rsquo;s, all lincoln needs is 
a RWD flagship for their comeback to be complete.And, if you&rsquo;re gonna 
knock Ecoboost, please also show me a stat or review that sees our new 
powertrain in a remotely bad light</p> <br>

<p>caddy FTW ALL THE WAY! like many other&rsquo;S said they are just rebadged 
fords and just wayy behind in the game! for fomoco fan&hellip;.. the reason the 
cts is a sport sedan is because that is what everyone wants speed and lux 
period! only granpas want a floater like the towncar or mks that is why bmw is 
doing so well is they bring a full package not just a soft ride and lux! get 
with the times lincoln! Either way I hope they both do well. but as for right 
now its not even close! buick is better then lincoln in my book!</p> <br>

<p>@CoasterkidSorry, but what Lincoln is doing is called platform-sharing, not 
rebadging. I bet that you wouldnt see a similarity between the cars you 
mentioned if you had them in front of you. Cadillac does the exact same thing 
with the SRX, and Audi with the A3, Q7 and A8.Luxury car? Lincoln definitely, 
Lincoln is pure luxury, not a sport sedan in a luxury sedan guise like the CTS.

<p>Saying cars such as the MKT or MKS are incredibly similar is like saying a 
cts is a G8 or an Es350 a Camry. Just because they share basic, essential 
components does not mean they are rebadged. Lincoln&rsquo;s classy design and 
abundance of tech and space suite my needs better than the bling bling of caddy

<p>But seriously, i&rsquo;d pick Cadillac because its not just a remake of a 
chevy. Lincoln is just a rebadged Ford. MKZ Fusion MKS Taurus MKT FLEX MKX Edge 
Navigator Epedition And who can forget Mark LT F-150Next Do A BUICK, CHRYSLER, 
MERCURY TOTD</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac is just more upscale in my opinion. Lincoln cars are to closely 
related to their Ford counterparts. I wish the best for both however.</p> <br>

<p>Definitely Caddy, the CTS and Escalade really pushed new design. Lincoln 
seems to only know how to redesign Ford grills and tail lights.</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac all the way. Lincoln just makes nicer versions of Ford Cars. Case 
in Point:MKS: TaurausMKZ: FusionMKT: FlexMKX: EdgeAt Least Caddillac has/had 
semi Unique cars: CTS, DTS, STS, old SRX. Lincoln cars are just TOO much like 
their counterparts, nice yes, but too much like them.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve liked cadillacs since they came out with the original CTS and 
even more so with the most recent CTS. I&rsquo;ve never really liked any 
Lincolns but glad to see they seem to be turning the corner lately. like Remdog 
said, I&rsquo;m rooting for both and hope to see them go head-to-head one day 
with MB, bmw, lexus, and audi. they&rsquo;re still spinning their wheels and 
have a ways to go but starting to gain some traction.</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln makes luxury cars?</p> <br>

<p>Cadillac definitely has pulled off the retro look much better than 
Lincoln&rsquo;s attempt. I love the vertical tailights on the CTS and other 
models. Lincoln seems like a new player in the luxury segment after their 
horrendous 90s and early 00s. I&rsquo;m rooting for both to make a comeback, 
but if I had to choose one, I would want the CTS.</p> <br>
