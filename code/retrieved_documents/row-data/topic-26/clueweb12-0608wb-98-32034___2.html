 Audi Q7 <strong>FORM AN ORDERLY Q</strong> 
<br> Audi have taken their time but have finally committed to the 'Sports 
Utility' market.<br>
<br>
<strong>  In not tackling BMW and Mercedes head on, 
Audi have played a rather smart card with the Q7 </strong> <br>
 It's long been 
something of a mystery as to why Audi haven't committed to the sports utility 
vehicle market. With an all-wheel drive pedigree to be proud of, and enough 
badge equity in the tank to drive premium sales, Audi have seen rivals such as 
BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and Volvo clean up. Even sister company Volkswagen have 
brought the Touareg to market while Audi twiddled their thumbs. The twiddling 
stopped a while back, when Audi started work on a secret project. The results 
of that development were unveiled in the shape of the Q7.<br>
<br>
Whether or 
not you see the Q7, priced from 38,075, as a big step forward for Audi really 
rather depends on your view of big 4x4s. I always liked the Allroad, a 
pragmatic vehicle that was more competent than most would require off road and 
had a reassuringly car-like feel on the tarmac. The air suspension system could 
turn your suave estate car into a mud plugger in a matter of seconds without 
the negative social connotations of larger 4x4s. The Allroad was a clever 
distillation of Audi's brand image - cool, well built and ever so slightly self 
effacing.<br>
<br>
The Q7 is a little brasher, although it's still hardly in 
the military surplus mould. It is certainly big though. It runs on a stretched 
version of the Volkswagen Touareg chassis and features a seven seat 
configuration, making it ideal for bigger families. If you can get away from 
the rugged mud plugging mentality and instead think of it as a multi-purpose 
estate car on growth hormone, you'll bond with the Q7 a whole lot quicker. Even 
its styling seems to distance it from off-roaders.<br>
<br>
The coupe-like 
dipping roofline isn't standard 4x4 fare, nor are the resolutely horizontal 
shoulders. Audi even offer contrasting body colours in a bid to emphasise the 
car's shapely profile. One can't really underestimate the importance of this 
vehicle to Audi, a company that looks set to belatedly diversify into some 
previously profitable market niches. The Q7 is rumoured to be spawning a Q5, a 
smaller and less expensive model that will bring the theme and the MPV-style 
interior trickery to a wider audience.<br>
<br>
Audi claim 28 seating and 
loading configurations are available in the Q7 and the seats in the second row 
are adjustable for fore/aft movement. This allows Audi to not only lay claim to 
the most generous second row legroom in the class but also - with the second 
row slid forward and the rear folded - to also pinch first prize for luggage 
capacity, a huge 775 litres.<br>
<br>
With a length of 5,086mm and a wheelbase 
of 3,002mm, the Q7 isn't the most nimble rock hopper, but it does feature 
variable ground clearance (from 180 to 240mm), hill descent assist and an 
off-road mode whereby the ESP stability control system backs off to allow for 
loose surfaces. There's also a trailer stabilisation system which reduces the 
risk of fishtailing via targeted brake intervention.<br>
<br>
Let's not kid 
ourselves here though. The Q7's off-road aspirations aren't anything much 
greater than muddy tracks and wet grass. This is a car which has a sensibly 
tarmac-biased set-up, from its 60:40 torque split to its 18-inch alloy wheels. 
If you really want to bring the bling, 19 or 20-inch rims are also offered. 
Another option that's sure to be popular among Q7 buyers is air suspension.<br>

<br>Four engines are available. The entry-level petrol unit is the six cylinder 
3.6 FSI, developing 280bhp. This sits below a powerful 4.2-litre V8 petrol unit 
also featuring FSI direct injection which cranks out a healthy 350bhp with a 
peak torque figure pitched at 440Nm. Of perhaps greater relevance to the UK 
market is the 3.0-litre TDI diesel. This features a state-of-the-art common 
rail injection system with piezo inline injectors helping it to a peak power 
figure of 240bhp, a substantial torque rating of 500Nm and reasonable fuel 
economy. At the top of the range sits the 322bhp 4.2-litre V8 TDI powerplant 
currently found in the A8.<br>
<br>
The Q7 is equipped as standard with quattro 
permanent four-wheel drive. Its Torsen centre differential directs power to all 
four wheels, on-road and off-road, which means fast-reacting power to whichever 
wheel can best deploy it and excellent lateral stability - the prerequisites 
for optimum driving dynamics and safety. The driver benefits - also thanks to 
virtually balanced axle load distribution - from even better agility and 
steering precision that remains practically free of torque steer. The chassis 
of the Audi Q7 contains numerous aluminium components - independent wheel 
suspension with double wishbones at the front and rear - also excels with its 
all-round qualities. Steel spring suspension and twin-tube shock absorbers are 
designed for sporty driving and superior comfort, even off-road. The tilted 
position of the rear spring and shock absorber unit reduces overall height and 
creates more room at the rear.<br>
<br>
Although some may point to the fact 
that Audi have arrived at the 4x4 party just as the richest pickings have 
thinned, there's still a massive demand for 'sports utes' in the USA and 
besides, the Q7 may be long but it isn't as in-your-face as many 4x4s. It's 
actually rather a clever move, taking the constituent parts of an Allroad and 
scaling them up a little. If you had to design what an Audi 4x4 would look 
like, chances are it wouldn't be too far off how the Q7 has turned out. That's 
usually a recipe for incipient success.  See also in this category... <br>
