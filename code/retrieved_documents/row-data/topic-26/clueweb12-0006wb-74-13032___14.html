<p>Weekly Top Three: Summer Surf Car Suggestions</p> 
<p> By Mark Takahashi | on 05/21/2010 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>More often than not, when people find out what I get to do for a living, 
they ask for my advice on their future car purchase. I don't always have the 
best answer for them on the spot, but it's always a fun discussion. I was 
celebrating with some friends last week, and the question came up. This request 
was much more interesting than most, simply because my friend has some specific 
needs and a fun option to accompany the car choice.</p>

<p>Weekly Top 3: Cars for Mom</p> 
<p> By Bryn MacKinnon | on 05/07/2010 03:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I'll say it: I am a mom. A woman who sometimes cleans your face with her 
own spit, says things like &quot;I suffered through 643 hours of labor with you 
and THIS is the thanks I get?&quot; and worries about the state of your 
undergarments and their effect on her reputation.&nbsp; Not always an easy job, 
motherhood. Or a pretty one, for that matter. But it's also not only about 
manipulative guilt tactics, bad haircuts and embarrassing you in front of your 
friends. Being a mom is also about transportation. Somebody's gotta get you to 
all those sports games, jazz classes,&nbsp;orthodontist appointments, and 
sleepovers. Those &quot;Mom's Taxi&quot; license plate frames aren't just 
corny; they speak the truth.</p> 
<p>But does mom's car have to be a bland, boring appliance? No way. So, in 
honor of Mothers Day (it's this Sunday, so there's still time for you to pick 
up a card, slacker), three cars for Mom that won't make the most important 
woman in your life yawn and reach for herpleated jean shorts.</p>

<p>Dream Car Corner: Audi Avus Concept</p> 
<p> By John DiPietro | on 05/06/2010 11:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>First off, I have to thank Mr. Romans for recently reminding me of this 
very interesting concept car from the four rings carmaker. Though concept cars 
can lead to prototypes which lead to production cars, more often than not they 
are simply bold displays of what an automaker is capable of. The Audi Avus 
concept, which was shown at the 1991Tokyo Auto Show, is one such car.</p>

<p>Face-Off: Super Bowl Car Ads: Audi A3 TDI vs Dodge Charger R/T</p> 
<p> By John DiPietro | on 02/15/2010 03:00 AM </p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Super Bowl Sunday is the one time when TV commercials make the leap from 
usually very annoying to potentially very amusing.&nbsp;Remember the1993 Bird 
vs Jordan commercialwhere the two basketball legends play a wild game of 
&quot;HORSE&quot; for a Big Mac.&nbsp;No?&nbsp;How about the side-splitting 
&quot;Terry Tate Office Linebacker&quot; spot from 2003?<br>
<br>
Being car 
guys, we particularly enjoy the automotive ads, and this year's Super Bowl had 
a few gems.&nbsp;Automotive Editors Warren Clarke and John DiPietro take 
alternate paths. Mr. Clarke nominates the environmentally-conscious Audi A3 TDI 
spot while JDP takes the opposite tack, backing everyman's right to drive a 
Dodge Charger packing a Hemi V8.</p>

<p>2011 Audi A8 First Production Car to Get Google Earth and Hybrid Nav</p> 
<p> By Doug Newcomb | on 12/17/2009 04:00 PM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Soon after it hits dealers' showrooms next spring, the 2011 Audi A8 will 
not only be the first production car to featureGoogle Earth maps, but also the 
first hybrid nav system to use both a hard-disk for mapping data and an 
Internet connection for downloading up-to-date info and preforming a live 
search.</p> 
<p>Controlled through Audi's next-generation Multi Media Interface that adds a 
touchpad and will be called MMI Touch, the A8's new tech tour de force will 
include a hard disk to handle nav, phone, audio data and graphics processing 
duties required to recreate the high-quality 3D images for Google Earth, while 
an optional GPRS/EDGE modem will manage online content.</p>

<p>2011 Audi A8 World Premiere: Modern Art meets Modern Automotive Design</p> 
<p> By Ron Montoya | on 12/10/2009 03:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Last week, I was invited to attend the world premiere of the 2011 Audi A8. 
This being their flagship vehicle, Audi spared no expense, housing guests at 
the Fontainebleau Hotel Miami Beach, in the heart of &quot;Millionaire's 
Row&quot;. It was a fitting backdrop for the luxury automaker and their 
&quot;Art of Progress exhibit.&quot; The A8's premiere was held at nearby Audi 
Pavilion, and was surrounded by an impressive art collection from theRubell 
Family.</p> 
<p>Though I wasn't allowed to drive the A8, I did see it in person, and 
learned some of the philosophy behind its design. Here are three things that 
caught my attention.</p>

<p>Talk Back Tuesday: Will Diesel Finally Succeed? 2009 Audi Q7 TDI Suggests 
&quot;Yes&quot;</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 10/28/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p>  I just drove the 2009 Audi Q7 3.0&nbsp;TDI home and back. Like most 
diesels I've driven recently, this one performed exceptionally well. All the 
standard-issue complaints (smelly, loud, slow) were absent,&nbsp;but&nbsp;every 
diesel&nbsp;I've driven over the past few years has&nbsp;shed those pitfalls, 
so that wasn't much of a surprise.</p> 
<p>Far more impressive are the mileage numbers two fellow editors attained as 
part of theQ7's recent&nbsp;mileage challenge. Even though it involved some 
creative driving techniques, a figure of 31.5 mpg out of a multi-ton, 
seven-passenger crossover is, quite simply, astonishing.</p> 
<p>Which raises the key question for today: After decades of luke-warm 
acceptance is it finally time for diesel to shine?</p>

<p>Talk Back Tuesday: Do Luxury Brands Still Make Sense?</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 10/21/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p>  Remember when buying an Acura or Audi or BMW or Lexus or any other 
premium brand meant you got a premium car? The idea&nbsp;was pretty 
simple:&nbsp;If you wanted a premium car ownership experience you had to pay a 
premium price and purchase a premium vehicle.</p> 
<p>As I drove the new 2009 Volkswagen CC recently it occurred to me the only 
thing separating this car from&nbsp;its Audi brethren was the emblem on the 
grille. Interior materials, performance, high-tech features, heck even exterior 
styling and &quot;presence&quot; were all up to Audi standards.</p> 
<p>So was the price, of course, with a VR6 4Motion model starting at $40,000 
(though $27,000 will get you into a base 2.0T&nbsp;car, which is still quite 
nice and a much better value).</p>

<p>2008 Audi R8: A Car Worthy of Long-Term Commitment</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 06/23/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>It's one of the hottest cars on the market right now. But unlike so many 
past and&nbsp;present&nbsp;&quot;gotta-have&quot; vehicles, the2008 Audi R8 
deserves it's &quot;ultra-hip&quot; hype. And as ournewest long-term car, we 
getta-have this mid-engine V8 supercar for the next three months.</p> 
<p>As a certified Ford GT addict there are&nbsp;very few performance cars that 
truly impress me, but this is one of them (theFerrari F430 and Porsche 911 GT3 
are the other two). Like the Ford and Ferrari it's got a mid-engine V8, but 
unlike those two F-cars the Audi offers all-wheel drive and an interior 
ambiance that makes the $132,000 as-tested price tag seem like a bargain (yes, 
the Ferrari has a good interior too, but at a starting price&nbsp;approaching 
$200,000 it doesn't strike me as a &quot;deal&quot;).</p> 
<p>The R8's soothing cabin is wrapped in sensual aluminum bodywork, giving the 
car an exotic appeal that further defies its (relatively) cheap price point. If 
you shop-by-spreadsheet the 911 Turbo looks like the &quot;better&quot; car in 
terms of pure performance numbers, but drive them back-to-back, ask yourself 
how often you actually<em>need</em> a sub-4 second zero-to-60 time versus how 
often you sit in&nbsp;your car's cabin and interact with its controls (I'm 
thinking the answers will be &quot;almost never&quot; and &quot;every time I 
drive it&quot; --&nbsp;respectively). Do that and you'll likely leave the 
Porsche keys on the table.</p>

<p>2008 Audi A6 4.2 Quattro: Sublime in All the Right Places</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 04/09/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Most 2008 Audi A6 shoppers probably won't&nbsp;use a second mortgage to buy 
one, but&nbsp;with a starting price of $57,000 (for the 4.2-liter 
V8&nbsp;version) you wouldn't be out of order to consider that option. Just 
watch those loan terms, will ya?</p> 
<p>Like every Audi from this century, the A6 marries sleek exterior design 
with sumptuous cabin accoutrements, and places it all on a stout-yet-supple 
achitecture driving all four wheels (the smaller, 3.1-liter V6 can be had in 
front-wheel drive). You'd think there's no getting around that 4,200-pound curb 
weight, but somehow the&nbsp;eggheads in Ingolstadt have imbued the A6 with a 
lithe manner, even when flinging it through my favorite set of twisties. I 
suspect the 350-horsepower V8, combined with all-wheel drive, gives it both the 
thrust and grip to&nbsp;counter that poundage.</p>

<p>Talk Back Tuesday: Hummer Book, World Car and CTR</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 03/25/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>I don't have one topic worthy of a full Talk Back Tuesday post, but I do 
have a few mini topics from the past week that, when added up, almost equate to 
one worthy discussion...hopefully.&nbsp;Here goes:</p> 
<p><strong>In the</strong> <strong>spirit of &quot;perfect</strong> <strong>
timing&quot; comes a new Hummer H2&nbsp;book:</strong> Yes, just as oil passes 
$100-a-barrel and&nbsp;gas hits $4-a-gallon we get a new book&nbsp;that, 
according to the press release:</p> 
<p><em>&quot;With unfolded centerfold the book reaches a width of 237 cm (94.5 
inches), wider than the subject of the book, the HUMMER H2, itself.HUMMER H2 - 
KING SIZE AMERICA! is the biggest and most exclusive car book in the world and 
is published in a limited edition of just 999 sequentially numbered and signed 
copies.On 200 gloss-laminated pages German automobile journalist 
Hans-J&uuml;rgen T&uuml;cherer tells a great many entertaining and amusing 
stories that surround this spectacular American SUV. More than 270 fascinating 
pictures up to 43 x 237 centimeters (17 x 94.5 inches) in size depict the 
HUMMER H2 in all its glorious details and from many highly unusual perspectives.
HUMMER H2 - KING SIZE AMERICA! is available for 999 Euros. The German edition 
is on sale now. The English version will be available online at</em><em>
www.h2book.com</em><em> starting in April 2008.&quot;</em> </p> 
<p>Yes, for a mere $1,500 you too can pay proper homage to your H2 with a book 
as obnoxious as the vehicle itself! Better reserve your copy today!!</p>

<p>2008 Audi TT 3.2 Quattro: Great Car, but Kinda Pricey</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 03/24/2008 06:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Awhile back I commented on what I feel is the definition of a &quot;Great 
Car.&quot; In short, a great car (or truck, or SUV, or minivan) is a vehicle 
that can do at least two (or more) things really well.&nbsp;For example, the 
Jeep Wrangler is a very good vehicle for what it's supposed to do, but what it 
does well is pretty much one thing, so it isn't a great car in my opinion. Some 
could argue a great car has purity, so something like the Wrangler<em>is</em> a 
great&nbsp;car. Some could argue that, but not me.</p> 
<p>Using this as a guideline, the 2008 Audi TT is a great car. I just drove a 
V6 version home and back, complete with DSG transmission, and this is a car 
that does many things really well.</p>

<p>2008 Audi S5: So Nice, I Drove It Thrice</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 03/07/2008 07:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>It's rare for me to get into a specific test vehicle more than once, unless 
it's a long-term car (and sometimes even those cars spend 12 months here and I 
only drive them two or three times). But in the past&nbsp;four months I've 
driven the 2008 Audi S5 three times (this is a short-term car that we only get 
for two weeks at a time; the S5 is on its second trip to the Edmunds offices). 
Thefirst time was in November, and I was immediately smitten with its 
combination of sleek body lines and Detroit-like V8 muscle.</p>

<p>2008 Audi S5: A Passionate German? Who'd a Thunk?</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 11/19/2007 07:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Like so many Audis (and, really, so many modern luxury cars) you can't 
think too carefully&nbsp;about the price tag when considering the new2008 S5 
coupe. At a starting price of $50K, and a finishing price closer to $60K once 
you add a few choice items like nav and adaptive headlights, this car is pricey 
-- plain and simple. It's 354hp V8 gives it a leg up onBMW's 335i, as does 
quattro all-wheel drive (it does zero-to-60 in 4.9 seconds), but those factors 
alone don't justify the increased coinage. Of course it's cheaper than a $75,000
BMW 650i and quicker than that two-door as well, so maybe it's a bargain? </p> 
<p>However, to possibly understand the S5 you have to step beyond spec sheets 
and price points and&nbsp;feature content. This sleek coupe has taken Audi's 
gift for gorgeous to a new level, with sweeping exterior lines and passionate 
interior panels that belie it's Teutonic heritage. A warm and welcoming cabin, 
with organic shapes to match its rich materials? What a concept!</p>

<p>2008 Audi RS4 Cabriolet: Great Car...but Bring Money!!</p> 
<p> By Karl Brauer | on 11/01/2007 07:00 AM </p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Because you just can't drive too many &quot;RS&quot; models (certainly I 
know<em>I</em> can't), I spent last night with Audi's superb&nbsp;RS4 
Cabriolet. This is the third performance Audi product I've driven in the past 
two weeks (after theRS4 sedan and S4 Avant), and, perhaps&nbsp;to no one's 
surprise, it's&nbsp;my favorite one&nbsp;so far. The same 420-horsepower V8 
provides the same killer thrust, and the same quattro all-wheel-drive system 
offers the same cornering grip you'll find in the four-door.</p> 
<p>I also finally&nbsp;figured out why these cars are so damn easy to 
heel-and-toe. Basically, the throttle is extremely responsive. Some on staff 
have described tip-in as overly aggressive, but I never found it objectionable 
in regular driving, and it makes blipping the throttle with the edge of your 
foot a snap while setting up your entry speed.&nbsp;So as&nbsp;with the RS4 
sedan,&nbsp;I&nbsp;found the Cabrio as confident as anything I've driven on 
Mulholland (even if high-end sports cars and exotics would be faster under 
race-track conditions).</p> 
<p>I was fully sold on the RS4 Carbriolet,&nbsp;then&nbsp;I looked up the 
price...</p>
