<h1>What's it like?</h1> 
<p>BMW first attempted to crack the hatchback market in 1994 with the 3 Series 
Compact, but it failed to bother rivals such as the Audi A3 and Volkswagen 
Golf. However, the 1 Series has fared far better, thanks to its blend of class 
and practicality. The rear-wheel-drive 1 Series has great balance when 
cornering and plenty of grip, while the steering is well weighted and accurate. 
The ride, however, is firm, and can jar on poor road surfaces, a problem not 
helped by its run-flat tyres. Even the tallest drivers should have no problem 
making themselves comfortable, thanks to the multi-adjustable seat and steering 
wheel. Rear-seat passengers won't be so happy, because of limited head- and 
legroom.</p> <br>

<h1>Which one should I get?</h1> 
<p>The 1 Series was originally available as a five-door only, with the 
three-door version following in 2007. This coincided with a mild face-lift and 
the introduction of more powerful, yet economical engines, and BMW&rsquo;s 
Efficient Dynamics technology. The 113bhp 116i petrol model has just enough 
punch, but was greatly improved in 2007, when power was increased to 120bhp and 
is the petrol engine to go for. The 118i with 127bhp (later 141bhp) is punchier 
and the 148bhp 120i (later 168bhp) is better still. The pinnacle of the range 
is the 261bhp six-cylinder 130i. There are far more diesel-powered cars on the 
used market, and the 118d with 120bhp (141bhp) is a great compromise of power 
versus economy. It's our favourite. From launch, there was also the 161bhp 
(later 175bhp) 120d, which is powerful yet smooth. In mid-2007, the 
performance-orientated 201bhp 123d was introduced, and in early 2009, the 
efficient 114bhp 116d went on sale. The entry-level model comes with four 
electric windows and a CD player, but no alloy wheels or air-con. The ES gets 
those, but the SE also adds climate control and parking sensors making it the 
version to look out for. The M Sport gets firmer suspension and sporty a 
bodykit.</p> <br>

<h1>What are the running costs?</h1> 
<p>The 116i averages between 37.7mpg and 46.3mpg, and emits between 143g/km 
and 181g/km of CO2, while the 118i does from 37.7mpg to 46.3mpg and emits 
140g/km to 176g/km. The120i averages from 38.1mpg to 44.1mpg, with emissions 
from 153g/km to 178g/km. However, the 130i is significantly more expensive to 
run at 30.7mpg to 34mpg and CO2 emissions between 197g/km and 221g/km. The 
diesels are much more efficient, with the 116d the best at 64.2mpg and 118g/km, 
the 118d just behind with between 50.4mpg and 62.8mpg and emissions from 
119g/km to 150g/km. The 120d averages 49.5mpg to 58.9mpg and 128g/km to 153g/km 
of CO2. The sporty 123d averages 54.3mpg and emits 138g/km of CO2. The 1 Series 
doesn&rsquo;t hold its value as well as the Audi A3 and Volkswagen Golf. The 
BMW is cheaper to insure than an A3, though, with cars ranging from groups 19 
to 32 &ndash; however, the Golf is even cheaper. When it comes to servicing 
costs, the Audi and BMW are evenly matched but the Golf is cheaper.</p> 
<h1>What should I look out for?</h1> 
<p>The BMW has proved very dependable, and is one of the few cars to earn top 
marks for reliability. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s totally 
fault free. Front tyres can wear quickly if the tracking is out and some cars 
have faulty steering racks. There are also some reports of faulty manual 
gearboxes and clutches, making it difficult or impossible to select a gear. 
However, the manual gearbox is a little stiff, anyway. Other reported problems 
include petrol engine ECUs failing, windows seizing shut, airbag faults &ndash; 
generating a warning light on the dashboard &ndash; and an issue with the 
electronic stability control, causing it to shut down. So far, the 1 Series has 
been the subject of just a handful of recalls: one concerning a rear axle 
problem, an issue with the power-assisted brakes and a possible fault with the 
front side airbags and seat belt tensioners.</p>
