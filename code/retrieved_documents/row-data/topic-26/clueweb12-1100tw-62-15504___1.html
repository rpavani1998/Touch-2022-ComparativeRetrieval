<h1>Audi A4 vs BMW 3 Series</h1> 
<p>Carlton Boyce</p> 
<p>/</p> 
<p>March 23, 2012</p> 
<p> </p>  The middleweight executive car market is one of the most fiercely 
contested there is, with every premium manufacturer looking for the biggest 
possible slice of the pie.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Quality, image, reliability, purchase 
price, residual value, performance and fuel efficiency are the cards that 
everyone is shuffling, and no-one deals them better than Audi with their A4 and 
BMW with their 3 Series.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  Audi are newer to the market but 
no less familiar, mainly because they sell more cars in the UK than BMW. This 
is a good thing &ndash; and a bad one. It produces turnover and profit but 
diminishes exclusivity and with exclusivity comes image.  &nbsp;  Who does it 
best then? Who makes the best all-rounder executive car? There&rsquo;s only one 
way to find out&hellip;  &nbsp; 
<h3> Looks</h3>  The new BMW is a variation on the familiar 3 Series design 
that we&rsquo;ve all come to know, love, and lust after. The 2012 car is a new 
model, yet retains the corporate DNA - you&rsquo;ll never mistake it for any 
other marque. Yet it looks slightly fussy to our eyes; it seems to be trying 
just that little bit too hard and there is just a bit too much gilding around 
the front end for it to look truly wonderful.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  Which 
isn&rsquo;t an accusation that can be levelled at the Audi A4, which after its 
recent facelift is a simpler design, more effortless, and sober. It&rsquo;s as 
if the original designer had his own way entirely with no input from the 
marketing department or the grey suits in accounts; he drew, they 
produced.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The LED front lights scowl, and the bonnet and front 
wings slide into the A-post like water onto glass. We think it is easily the 
most handsome car in the segment, which is an astonishing accomplishment given 
the main players involved.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  There are no losers here 
though, as both cars look great; they ooze class and elegance and no-one is 
going to mistake the driver of either for someone who gets his hands dirty at 
work.&nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<h3> Interior</h3>  The interior of both cars is well designed, impeccably 
specified, and beautifully installed. Both will soothe your workday stresses 
and both are big enough to accommodate your family and impress three of your 
colleagues.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  The Audi is slightly more restrained and 
sober, which we think is a good thing. The BMW looks a bit more fiddly and yet 
simultaneously more expensive. Both are stuffed with neat pieces of design that 
wouldn&rsquo;t look out of place on a high-end stereo.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  
Really, the best car will depend on your own personal taste, but most of the 
journalists that have driven both cars tend to favour the BMW, giving it its 
first win.  &nbsp; 
<h3> Standard equipment</h3>  Both cars have a decent level of equipment as 
standard &ndash; and both can quickly become very expensive when you start to 
dig deep into the options list!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The A4, in 2.0 TDI 143 SE spec, 
gets climate control, cruise control, rear parking sensors, cloth interior and 
17&quot; wheels as standard. It's priced at &pound;29,110.<br>
 &nbsp;  The 
broadly comparable BMW 318d SE also gets climate control, cruise control rear 
parking sensors, cloth interior and 17&quot; wheels. It's priced at 
&pound;26,925.  &nbsp;  They are fairly similar in terms of standard kit, but 
be careful about how much the options that are important to you cost on each 
car.  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; 
<h3> Driving</h3>  This is the weakest category for the A4, as it just 
can&rsquo;t match the 3 Series&rsquo; chassis. The Audi suffers from the 
customarily firm ride (especially when it is fitted with large wheels) and poor 
steering feel that is rapidly becoming an Audi trademark.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The 
BMW has fluidity and a responsiveness that the Audi simply can&rsquo;t match 
and so it takes a well-deserved win here. The simple truth is that few people 
make cars that drive as well as BMW.  &nbsp; 
<h3> Engines</h3>  The most popular engines in both cars are the high-end 
diesels, bought because they give great fuel efficiency and an effortless wave 
of torque that makes for relaxed driving; important when you are pounding the 
roads of the UK day after day.  &nbsp;  BMW&rsquo;s ubiquitous 320d engine 
offers 181bhp and a potential fuel economy of 62.8mpg. This is no 
economy-optimised wimp of an engine though; it delivers sparkling performance 
(0-60 in 7.5 secs) and, whilst it might not be the most refined engine in its 
class, it is still impressively quiet.&nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;  The Audi A4 
puts up a compelling argument of its own too: 177bhp from the 2.0-litre 
turbodiesel engine is impressive, but the experts say that it is the quality of 
delivery that is so impressive, They love its free-revving nature and smooth, 
torquey power output. It&rsquo;ll top 140mph, gets to 60 in 8.2 &nbsp;and 
returns 61.4mpg; &nbsp;impressive figures and likely to be enough for most 
drivers.  &nbsp;  Nonetheless, the BMW just takes the edge in this category, 
although it is a narrow victory.  &nbsp; 
<h3> Price</h3>  The BMW 3 Series range starts at &pound;22,695 for the 318i 
ES and rises all the way to &pound;38,950 for the 335d M Sport. Our benchmark 
320 in SE guise costs &pound;27,900 and comes with Stop/Start, air-con and the 
sort of toys that are almost obligatory at this level.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Audi 
A4 range matches that of the BMW pretty closely as you&rsquo;d imagine, 
stretching from &pound;23,625 for the 1.8 TFSI to the 3.0 TDI quattro at 
&pound;38,405.  &nbsp;  The 2.0-litre TDI SE with 177bhp costs &pound;27,575 in 
SE form, which just undercuts theBMW 320d SE which costs &pound;28,025. <br>
 
&nbsp;  The Benefit In Kind (BIK) figures for both cars are broadly similar 
too. Residual values are on a par, just take a look atmotors.co.uk&nbsp;for 
proof.<br>

<h3> Expert Reviews</h3>  Here at carbuzz we compile and summarise expert 
reviews for each car. The BMW reviews have been unanimously positive, everyone 
who has driven it absolutely loves it.  &nbsp;  That&rsquo;s not to say the A4 
is a bad car, far from it. The reviews of the 2012 A4 have been largely 
positive, praising the revisions made and new line-up of engines. However from 
reading the BMW reviews, it's clear that the experts say it's clearly the 
better car.  &nbsp;&nbsp; 
<h3> Verdict</h3>  There&rsquo;s no doubting really that the general consensus 
is that the BMW is the better car. It's more modern and a quick look at the 
3-Series review page shows it's an outstanding car.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We&rsquo;d 
suggest that you drive both and make up your mind for yourself because they 
might look similar on paper but they&rsquo;re very different to drive &ndash; 
and own; Brian Ferry would choose an A4 because it is so effortlessly cool and 
offers a Bauhaus sobriety that the BMW just doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s an 
intellectual car, not a sporting one.  &nbsp;  Whereas Steve McQueen would 
choose the 3 Series; it&rsquo;s sublime chassis and handling keep it at the top 
of the list for those customers for whom driving is all about how a car feels 
round the bends. If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to go to the N&uuml;rburgring then 
this is the car for you.  &nbsp;  You wouldn&rsquo;t be unhappy to have either 
car on your drive, but the one that you choose probably says more about you 
than you&rsquo;d care to admit&hellip;  &nbsp;  Check out our full guide to
