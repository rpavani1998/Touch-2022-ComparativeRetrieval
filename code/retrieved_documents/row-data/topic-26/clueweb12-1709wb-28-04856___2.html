<h3> BMW Spreads Its Olympic Joy, Audi Tries Squashing It </h3> <br>
<br>
BMW 
is marketing its largest ever brand awareness campaign during this year&rsquo;s 
Winter Olympics. The &ldquo;Story of Joy&rdquo; campaign is built off the early 
foundation first started with the launch of the BMW Z4 campaign.<br>
<br>
The 
ads focus on new products, drivers and one TV spot showcases the compellingBMW 
Vision EfficientDynamics concept car that debuted last August at the Frankfurt 
Auto Show. From BMW&rsquo;s Press Release about the campaign, &ldquo;Story of 
Joy&rdquo; introduces a new creative aesthetic characterized by strong, 
colorful images often conveying people and their experiences with the subtlest 
of references to BMW products.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Brand messages encompass 
everything from emotional responses about the product line making drivers feel 
youthful and inspired. The campaign also dips heavily into BMW&rsquo;s heritage 
of driver events. It&rsquo;s the second time in the past two years BMW has 
highlighted the Southern CaliforniaBimmerfest event, which is one of the 
largest gathering of BMW owners and fans. The last time was in aspot for the 
last 3-series sedan. <br>
<br>
Audi Begins Its Latest Brand Campaign Too <br>

<br>The new brand campaign comes at a time when BMW&rsquo;s most aggressive 
competitorAudi is launching its own brand campaign mocking BMW for falling 
behind Audi in &ldquo;three straightCar &amp; Driver comparisons.&rdquo; The 
Audi spot is entertaining, but the BMW brand ads appeal to those who are 
advocates and satisfied owners of BMW products.<br>
<br>
Showing images of 
happy owners, enjoying their vehicles is nice feel good marketing, but is it 
effective? This is a difficult question to answer and depends on what BMW is 
trying to gain from the spots; sales of course, but I&rsquo;m sure some 
positive brand awareness is in the mix of campaign goals too.<br>
<br>
The 
issue is that the ads are forgettable and barely interesting enough to share 
from a brand enthusiast perspective. Unlike the3-Series ad from 2008 that 
brought together a strong emotive response from many BMW brand advocates and 
fans, the new Olympic spots fall flat giving people little reason to talk about 
the ads or promote them to their social network.<br>
<br>
The Audi ads have a 
more interesting message; though, I&rsquo;m personally not much of a fan of 
mentioning your top competitor in your marketing, since you&rsquo;re just 
giving your key competitor free advertising. That said the Audi ads are at 
least memorable and interesting enough to share. They're definitely not 
forgettable.<br>
<br>
The BMW Joy campaign is pleasant and aligns well with an 
Olympic games feel good message. It&rsquo;s just that the ads will probably be 
lost in the marketing clutter.<br>
