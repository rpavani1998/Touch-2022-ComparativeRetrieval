<h2> Volvo Plans Luxury Assault on Audi, BMW and Mercedes with New Engine and 
Platform Strategy</h2> 11-16-2011&nbsp;12:22 PM #1 <br>

<blockquote> <br>
<br>
 An hour north of Los Angeles, in a fairly conventional 
business park just off the 101 freeway, is Volvo&#146;s North American 
technology and design center. It&#146;s unremarkable in its outward appearance, 
just another two-story warehouse-type building tucked in along a wide, 
tree-lined parkway. But for the last twenty-five years, this place, better 
known as the Volvo Monitoring and Concept Center, has been the American home 
for a small handful of the Swedish carmaker&#146;s best thinkers. And with the 
Los Angeles Auto Show just around the corner, it seemed the perfect venue for 
the newly independent brand to show off just a hint of what its future holds.

<blockquote>  Stefan Jacoby revealed that the company&rsquo;s next wave of 
products will move upmarket to compete with other established luxury brands 
(BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi in particular).  Bummer..... <br>
<br>
<br>
 What 
does &quot;luxury assault&quot; and &quot;move upmarket&quot; mean? What is it 
about a current Volvo S60 or XC60 that they feel isn't to the level of BMW, 
Mercedes, and Audi?<br>
<br>
 Is volvo going to go back to RWD and transverse 
engines?<br>
<br>
 And a key part of the article is just about getting down to 
ONLY 4 cyl engines.</blockquote>

Depends. 1st off, FWD architecture is USUALLY transverse, but Subaru and the 
upper-echelon of Audis use a longitudinal configuration and still offer FWD 
base models. Problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each 
other, as anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with 
pampering oneself, showboating and seeking prestige by blowing money. Wasting 
gas, OTOH, is a good way to show prestige by blowing money. The previous 
4-banger-exclusively announcement will keep them out of consideration, except 
on the compact-car front, with the C/S/V 30-50 cars.</blockquote>

 A lot of hybrids today would actually perform a lot

<br>
 And it's actually probably a hinderance 
for Audi's fwd cars  But a significant part of Audi's engine block hangs over 
and in front the front axle which increases &quot;plowing&quot; and nose-dive 
effect when cornering and/or braking.<br>
<br>
 On the other hand, our engines 
(up to this point) have always been inline (with the exception of the 4.4L V8) 
whereas Audi uses V6s and V8s. Mounting inline engines in a longitudinal manner 
would encroach not only in safety but also in the interior cabin, as far as 
interior dimensions are concerned.</blockquote>

Problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each other, as 
anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with pampering

is a good way to show prestige by blowing money. The previous 
4-banger-exclusively announcement will keep them out of consideration, except 
on the compact-car front, with the C/S/V 30-50 cars.  Agreed. Luxury is about 
being able to do as you wish, about not having to worry about the little things 
and about enjoying life. Worrying about 2 mpg here and there is not luxury.<br>

 A lot of hybrids today would 
actually perform a lot better if the gas and electric worked together when 
launching. But then that defeats economy. And of course, still no clue at all 
on the premium for their hybrid powertrain.  There are 'performance hybrids' as 
well, meaning the hybrid tech is used to augment the gasoline engine, ie: 
Porsche Cayenne Hybrid drive-train; or the ill fated Honda Accord Hybrid. Maybe 
Volvo will be heading in that direction. But alas, I doubt it. They are too 
enviro for that and will focus on efficiency instead.<br>

<br>
 This 
company cannot make up it's mind what it wants to do.  Disagree. They dropped 
the R many moons ago, so the performance thing hasn't been part of Volvo for 
many years now. It was quite clear for some time now that the R will not return 
as that is not the direction the company wants to head into. The collaboration 
with Polestar might one day evolve into more, but for now sport Volvo's are out 
of the question. The whole R-Design thing is something everyone does - sport 
look packages are offered by many manufacturers, including the AMG package from 
MB (not the actual AMG cars). Capitalizing on the R name was a smart move as it 
used an established name to give credit to the package where before there was 
none.<br>
<br>
 The 4cyl only things bothers me, as we all know, a small engine 
needs to work much harder to push a larger car then a slower working larger 
engine. We all know the 2.5T and the V8 get very similar mileage figures on a 
tank of fuel. Forced induction/DI be what it may, pushing that much air into 
small engines will cause more long-term problems and work the engine that much 
harder.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote &nbsp; <br>

Capitalizing on the R name was a smart move as it used an established name to 
give credit to the package where before there was none.  I think there's a big 
difference between Volvo and the others. Audi actually offers a true S, BMW a 
true M, and Mercedes the AMG. There hasn't been an R for a while. I'll bet most 
people don't even get 'R' anymore or know where it came from. But say S, M, or 
AMG, and that's a different story. And when they read their magazines and drool 
over the S, M, and AMG reviews, and then they go to buy a regular model car, 
but then see a cosmetic 'package', well, they know the meaning behind it. I'll 
bet many will think that just having the extra letters somewhere on their car 
along with the styling will to others maybe look like the real thing. It's a 
feeling/aspiration that they're really something better. What exactly is an 
R-design wishing it was or aspiring to be? IMO, the whole R, R-Design, and 
R-Design Polestar thing is a marketting screwup.<br>
<br>
 Another debate is 
just how 'established' the R name even was given that of all the brands, it was 
at the bottom of the list and never really ever taken that seriously.

actually offers a true RS, BMW a true M, and Mercedes the AMG. I would not 
place an S Audi on the same level as an M or AMG vehicle. The S4 falls in 
between the 335i and the M3 but it's closer to the 335i. Same with the 335is/M3 
coupe and the S5.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote &nbsp; <br>

<blockquote> I think the point he was trying to make is that the other Euros

need a power train with more cylinders than four.</blockquote>

&quot;luxury assault&quot; the equivalent to what Hyundai and Kia are doing to 
Nissan, Honda, and Toyota?<br>
<br>
 If so, we have to analyze just how it is 
that Hyundai and Kia are pulling this off, and if volvo is capable of going 
that far. Obviously, saying it and actually DOING IT, are two complete 
different things.<br>
<br>
 Although, of course, I don't think anybody has 
answered yet exactly where Volvo's currently are falling short in the luxury 
dept. What luxury features does a current volvo NOT have?<br>
<br>
 On another 
note, what percentage of BMW's and Mercedes are sold with that base standard 
fake leather? Is that considered luxury level? Are the majority of their cars 
upgraded to the real stuff? Maybe Volvo should think of dropping cloth and 
going to the fake leather as standard also?</blockquote>

What is it about a current Volvo S60 or XC60 that they feel isn't to the level 
of BMW, Mercedes, and Audi?  I think that Volvo needs to work on its interiors 
to make them more on the level that you mention. More durable leather is a case 
in point. Using my 2007 V70 as an example, I also think that they could change 
the shift linkage so that it has less of a &quot;cheap&quot; feel when you use 
the &quot;girltronic.&quot; There are other areas where they could improve 
their interiors, but I am not one to like long winded posts.</blockquote>

 It is really odd that the ventilated seats are only available on the S80 (I 
think). I would have expected the new S60 and the XC60 to have them at least.

<blockquote> I have said it before and I'll say it again...Volvo isnt going to 
skim off many hardcore Audi or Bimmers folks. They need to focus on style, 
simplicity, luxury features, and economy and win. Over folks new o luxury...ie 
younger buyers. They will also appeal to the practical mass that want to drive 
something nice but still get good mileage. They need to come in just under the 
above mentioned price points and do so with more standard features. Hyundai is 
doing this and I think it will ultimately force fewer and fewer 
&quot;options&quot; with Toyota and Honda. It's crazy o me that a $50000 xc60 
can't be had with ventilated seats. Hyundai has this, nav, rear camera, and 
heated seats front band rear, Bluetooth, and infotainment in the new azera at 
low 30s. It will render the already sad and pointless base Toyota Avalon, even 
more sad.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote &nbsp; <br>

available on the XC90 since it isn't on the site (unless it is now gone for 
2012).<br>

 Edit: I found the executive package listed on the Australian

 I understand that a small displacement engine (e.g. 4-cyl)

popularity of the A4 and Audi's ever increasing sales seems to suggest that the 
4-cylinder engine isn't holding back sales despite the price. The new BMW 328i 
is also a turbo 4 (and I really hate the way it sounds). Audi also has a 
4-cylinder in the A6 and BMW has one in the 528i. The only different is that 
they aren't limiting their models to the smaller engines (except the A4), just 
offering them. I don't know how successful Volvo will be without offering 
something larger, especially on the S80 and XC90.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote

 I don't think they

automobiles like the s80 need to be redone to catch up with the times. The new
