<p>Traditionally, Audi and Subaru have received the most recognition for 
having extensive availability of all-wheel-drive in their product lineups, but 
ifLincoln has any say in the matter, it wants to be included in the AWD 
fraternity too.</p> 
<p>With the discontinuation of the rear-drive-only Town Car, Lincoln notes 
that all-wheel-drive is now available in all the brand&rsquo;s vehicles, from 
the MKZ and MKS sedans, through to the MKX and MKT crossovers, as well as the 
full-size, body-on-frame Navigator SUV.</p> 
<p>In terms of sales mix, the ostensible Town Car replacement MKT is trending 
at 72 percent all-wheel-drive, followed by the MKX and Navigator, both at 62 
percent, the MKS at 46 percent, and the MKZ with 25 percent.</p> 
<p>All-wheel-drive is also an enabling technology to allow full optimization 
of the 355 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque produced by the 3.5-liter 
EcoBoost V-6 in the MKS and MKT models. That level of power in a 
front-wheel-drive vehicle would likely result in poor driveability and control 
characteristics.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We see all-wheel drive as a core technology option for the entire 
Lincoln line-up, both today and for the future,&rdquo; C.J. O&rsquo;Donnell, 
Group Marketing Manager for Lincoln, said.</p>

<p>All very good posts, with very good suggestions for the most part. But 
first and immediately, they have to change the names of these vehicles! The 
MK-who? MK-what? C&rsquo;mon, Ford, you can do better. Mulhally was so bent on 
changing the 500 back to Tauras, does he know Ford own&rsquo;s Lincoln too?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face facts, Lincoln is not a luxury brand &ndash; at least not 
anymore. At best, Lincoln is a near-luxury brand. Ford simply does not know 
what it wants to or should do with Lincoln and therein lies the rub. There have 
been different &lsquo;plans&rsquo; laid out and/or otherwise conjured up as to 
what to do with Lincoln and that&rsquo;s all. Unless one counts the MKT and, to 
a degree, the MKS, all Lincolns look exactly like their Ford cousins with 
different grilles. As others have posted, you look at Audi and you see cars 
that exude quality and a certain cachet, look at Subaru and you see 
fun-to-drive and the fact that they have beed AWD rides for seemingly forever. 
You look at Lincoln and you see Ford&rsquo;s stepsister and today that&rsquo;s 
not meant as much of a compliment. Today, you look at Ford (the company) and 
you see it as the only multidivisional auto company where only one division 
(Ford) has a &lsquo;halo&rsquo; car and the other (Lincoln) does not. Lincoln 
clearly needs a RWD vehicle if it&rsquo;s going to be Ford&rsquo;s luxury 
division. It needs its own design language to distinguish them from Fords and 
clearly more support from Ford (the company).</p> <br>

<p>Who would of thought Ford would struggle so much to add rear wheel drive to 
any vehicles.<br>
 Its almost as if its all a fluke.</p> <br>

<p>Like others have said, the current Lincolns leave a lot to be desired. AWD 
is fine if you want it. Many people have no need for it. I certainly 
wouldn&rsquo;t want it here in the desert where there is no snow or rain or 
ice. Between Ford&rsquo;s weaker powertrain warranty (compared to GM and 
Chrysler) and my difficulty in getting them to honor their own extended 
warranty, I probably would not buy a Ford, though half my vehicles over the 
past 40 years have been Ford or Mercury.</p> <br>

<p>A lot of customers want AWD instead of FWD, considering the weather we have 
around the whole world, surely it would be more appropriate!</p> 
<p>So many people won&rsquo;t buy small to compact sports/premium products 
with FWD.</p> <br>

<p>i know that lincoln is coming out with the concept C for production, will 
this be awd too? it should be based on what would have been the focus RS 
chassis, and come in a sedan form. the mkz should be based on the next 
generation mustang platform, with a coupe variant, the next mks should be a 
four door coupe like the CLS, and A7, and would come in a four door convertible 
variant. this vehicle would, of course have b-pillarless suicide doors. then 
there should be a model above this, on the D4 platform and it would compete 
with the s-class and such. it would aim to be the most luxurious, like the 
continental was in the 60&prime;s. then the next mkt would be more like the 
explorer</p> <br>

<p>Great news about AWD in Lincolns but why can&rsquo;t be all&ndash;wheel 
drive as an option used in Ford cars like the global Fiesta and Focus? Ford 
should sell an AWD option for these cars on the global market.</p> <br>

<p>I have to say I agree with lincoln. awd is much more appealing than front 
wheel drive when it comes to luxery cars.</p> <br>

<p>Why they don&rsquo;t bring the Falcon/Territory here, they are perfect 
replacements for the MKS and the MKT. Both are rear-drive with optional AWD, 
the 3.7L V6, 3.5L Ecoboost and 5.0L V8 fit nicely under the hood and you cant 
buy Ford badged versions of them here in the US.</p> 
<p>A CTS-V/M5 fighter with a supercharged 550 horse 5.4L is a no brainer.</p> 
<p>Add DI to the 6.2 coupled to a 8 speed and drop them into the Navigator, 
bring here some of those 4.4L TDI V8&prime;s that Ford sells to Land Rover, no 
need to use the 6.7.</p> <br>

<p>Good Idea give Australia the fun RWD Falcon while we get the boring FWD 
Taurus/MKS, AWD is a good idea for smaller entry luxury cars but thats all. 
Cadillac is seriously leaving Lincoln in the dust pretty soon almost all of 
it&rsquo;s cars will be RWD, Chrysler is even leaving Lincoln and even Ford in 
the dust in RWD. Also get rid of the little four bangers and bring back the V8 
it&rsquo;s a luxury brand and what happened to the early 2000s when all 
Lincolns had V8s, if they want four cylinders call them Mercurys.</p> 
<p>I think they need a new RWD Mark IX coupe and convertible to take on the 
Caddy CTS coupe and they need a V-series like cars with big old V8s not turbo 
V6s.</p> <br>

<p>So in other words, Ford is unwilling to Create a RWD platform that Lincoln 
despritely needs to go up against, BMW, Mercedes, Caddilac etc&hellip;. So the 
only option left is to add AWD to lincoln cars which is nothing more than Ford 
vehicles with different styling. Epic Fail, Atleast Caddilac is on the right 
track with the ATS, next gen CTS etc&hellip; On this road Lincoln will barley 
be competitive with Buick.</p> <br>

<p>Amen! We really could have three great luxury brands on our hands to 
compete w/ the three great German brands (kind of the way we have the Detroit 
three and the Japan three) but right now the only worth beans is Cadillac. 
Chrysler&rsquo;s 300 seems to sort of do an okay job but I really want 
Chrysler/Jeep to compete with Mercedes more. I don&rsquo;t see why Lincoln 
SHOULDN&rsquo;T take on Audi (thus pitting Cadillac against BMW). Audi relies 
heavily on turbo 4s and V6s with only the A8 coming w/ a V8 (and even that may 
change). Ford already has the Eco-boost technology to produce some stellar 
turbo 4 and 6 engines. All they need is a RWD portfolio and a fresh design 
language for Lincoln and Audi would have an American competitor on its 
hands&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>At this point, Lincoln is looking a lot like the Chrysler brand of the 
1990s (remember the super-K Imperials and Fifth Avenues) and Cadillac of the 
late 1980s and early 1990s. Both realized over a decade ago, that a luxury car 
is more than plush seats and traction control: it is about having a true, 
balanced RWD platform. Ever since Ford gave up on the LS, it has been a 
downward spiral. I see Lincoln today as boring and badge engineered.</p> <br>

<p>A good strategy to improve the Lincoln product lineups is erasing the MKT 
and bringing back Continental. I agree all models must be so far away of 
current Ford models, because Lincoln could pass away in a few years ahead like 
Mercury did. AWD is a nice idea, but as enthusiast as I am it&rsquo;s not 
enough to gain all respect Lincoln needs to. It&rsquo;s right here where car 
design companies go in action (Pininfarina or Giugiaro) to improve all 
Lincoln&rsquo;s sheet metals. I don&rsquo;t care engine options, the most 
important thing here is giving Lincoln a chance to compete Bimmers, MB&rsquo;s 
or Audi, even Caddies. In other words, a huge makeover.</p> <br>

<p>I wonder if Ford would make more money if they became more dedicated to 
Lincoln? Using the same platform with slightly better materials and selling it 
at marked up prices must net them a pretty penny. It&rsquo;s the same situation 
as the Converj. GM wanted to sell it so that they could recoup losses on the 
Volt. Adding leather, AWD and nicer interior materials is nothing in cost 
compared to the amount of money that goes into engine and chassis development, 
but they still charge premium prices. If Lincoln is making Ford decent money, 
then I don&rsquo;t see them changing their direction any time soon.</p> <br>

<p>Problem is, while Lincoln could possibly be making Ford a nice nickel and 
dime every here and there, dealerships suffer because of over supply. Look at 
how long MKT&rsquo;s sit on dealer lots&hellip;its a shame. I doubt Lincoln 
makes anything for Ford, as FORD (the brand) is whats boosting the profits over 
in Detroit.</p> 
<p>Also, I like the Mark idea, it fits. Mark Z, Mark S, Mark T, Mark 
X&hellip;I like that. The Mark S sounds like something I&rsquo;d want to 
drive!!&hellip;as long as the styling gets better. Lincoln desperately needs a 
performance division to get noticed. Look at what V did for Cadillac&hellip;</p>

<p>Another issue with Lincoln is just the visual feel of the vehicle. I 
can&rsquo;t pinpoint it to me most Lincolns looks good, with the exception of 
the navigator &amp; MKT but they just lack something visually. With a MB or 
Bimmer or even Infiniti there is a look that screens out luxury &amp; prestige. 
Lincolns look, although nice does not trigger the emotions in me that other 
luxury marques do. When I look at Mercedes E-Class I see a premium car, when I 
look at a MKS its merely a nice car. The Lincoln LS although kinda bland used 
to have the premium appeal to me.</p> <br>

<li> Nell Posted on: April 28, 2011&nbsp;1:32 pm Reply <br>

<p>Honestly, fix the styling and add more pizazz to the brand. Lincoln&rsquo;s 
biggest problem isn&rsquo;t the fact that its essentially a Ford add-on (same 
could be said about Audi, Lexus and Buick), its the fact that Ford relies way 
too much on tradition, rather than passion. Passion is how GM found success 
with Cadillac&hellip;.and the sad thing is, Lincoln had a passionate vehicle, 
the Lincoln LS. Still the best Lincoln to date IMHO.</p> <br>

<p>Lincoln needs to get serious. Stop add trim option to Fords and start 
making exclusive cars. Also, fix those hideous grilles! They look like AC units 
from Hades!</p> <br>

<li> Kyle V Posted on: April 28, 2011&nbsp;1:13 pm Reply <br>

<p>O and if I were in charge of Lincoln here would be my plan.<br>
 Short Term
<br> 1. Lighten up the MKS, change the name to Mark-S. Engines would range from 
a turbo I4 bored out a little from Fords own ecoboost so that it is unique and 
produces around 250hp. Next step up would be a 3.7 with direct injection to 
differentiate it from the ford motor. Output around 330hp. And for the top of 
the line I would use a 3.7 ecoobosted for around 400hp.</p> 
<p>2. MKZ- Shrink it to the size of a 3 series, make awd standard. Base engine 
would be the I4 from the mks, next step up would be the DI mks 3.7 non turbo 
motor.</p> 
<p>3. MKX- Lighten moderately, give completely different sheet metal from 
edge; make the 3.7 non turbo the standard motor.</p> 
<p>4.MKT-Kill it.</p> 
<p>5.Navigator- Enough brand equity is in the name to make it worth saving. 
Put in the bigger Lincoln ecoboost motor for around 400hp, and offer a diesel 
option. Possibly the 6.7 out of the superduties?</p> 
<p>6. Town Car- Rework it, same platform through in some retro styling, offer 
a choice of either the Lincoln ecoboost or the 6.2 out of the F-series. Make a 
diesel option, possibly a ford euro diesel. For the platform try to work some 
magic on the LRA setup (ala mustang) Sure it wont be a S Class competitor but 
it will satisfy the current market for the car (fleets, and senior citizens) 
and may even bring in a few from the Chrysler dealers ( 300c)</p> 
<p>Long term- MKS, MKX, MKZ all become based on the mustang platform 
(Lengthened and shortened as necessary) and my list of engines above becomes 
available.</p> 
<p>Navigator- Same as above plan</p> 
<p>Mark 9- Bigger vehicle based on the mustang platform designed to compete 
with the 6 series. Engines range from ecoboost 3.7 to a range topping ecoobost 
5.0 with 600hp. Make this vehicle available with awd or rear. Imagine a 600hp 
Awd Lincoln tangling with Nissan gtrs??????</p> 
<p>Continental- Completely new platform. S-Class in size and luxury. Ecoboost 
3.7 standard, optional 6.2 as range topper. 6.2 should be messaged to make 
around 450hp.</p> 
<p>Also- Make SVT a Lincoln performance division as well. SVT has brand equity 
that will carry into the Lincoln showroom.</p> <br>

<p>As much as I hate to say it Lincoln currently has no vehicles that appeal 
to me. The MKS is very nice looking, as well as the MKX but if I were in the 
market for a luxury vehicle I would pop for a Mercedes, or a BMW. Rwd is 
something I believe any premium vehicle should have. Audi is the only non RWD 
Company that has any appeal to me. Also from a style standpoint any other 
premium brand has Lincoln stomped. Hopefully the guy from caddy can help them 
out a bit. Btw before any ford fan boys try to bash me my family own 7 fords 
currently, and I have several relatives that work for Ford. I am a die hard 
ford lover but even I have to admit Lincolns lost.</p> <br>
