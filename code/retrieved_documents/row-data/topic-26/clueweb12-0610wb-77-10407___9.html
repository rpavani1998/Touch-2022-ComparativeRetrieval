<p>One Again</p> 
<p><strong>BMW's baby has been reborn, but is it better now?</strong></p> <br>

<br> <br>
 When we drove the new 1 Series up to Kuala Lumpur recently, we were 
much impressed with the car's capabilities along the winding back roads of 
Malaysia. The baby Bimmer coped well not only in the corners, as is expected of 
a BMW, but also on the often rough and unwieldy road surfaces that is truly 
Malaysia, highlighting the exemplary ride quality of the new 1 Series.<br>
<br>

 But that is Malaysia, which is a whole different animal from our tiny little 
island. A good hatchback should preferably be compact and nimble enough to 
tackle tight city streets and fight the urban battle, whilst still being 
well-rounded enough to be liveable on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
 The original 1 
Series was a bit of a flawed product. While it drove well, its overall package 
just fell short of the high standards that the Bavarian carmaker has set for 
itself and its cars. Despite that, it still became a strong seller worldwide, 
proving once again the power of branding.<br>
<br>
 Now it's time for Baby 
Bimmer, take two. Can the new 1 Series address the flaws of its predecessor, 
and bring the Bavarian hatchback to another level in the face of ever 
competitive rivals?<br>
<br>
<strong>Exterior</strong> <br>
<br>
 The 1 Series 
hatchback's looks has been called all sorts of names by people over the years, 
ranging from 'unique', to 'different', to 'challenging'. And those are just the 
ones that are decent and printable.<br>
<br>
 The new one continues that form, 
and like it or hate it, it is most certainly a design that polarises opinions. 
Whatever one thinks, there is no doubt that the 1 Series' styling is a talking 
point for sure. <br>
<br>
<br>
Up front, the odd triangular headlamps and the 
pointy nose make the car seem a bit cross-eyed and awkward. Someone even made a 
reference to the titular character in the popular game Angry Birds.<br>
<br>
 
If the front is provocative, then the rear end of the new 1 Series is sadly 
uninspiring. More than one critic compared the 1 Series' rump to the Volkswagen 
Polo, which, for BMW, might not be all that flattering. The similarity is quite 
uncanny though.<br>
<br>
 The 1 Series is available in two trim levels, and our 
118i test car was decked out in Sport spec. The difference between this and the 
other Urban trim cosmetically lies mainly in the grille, with Sport having 
eight black vertical bars in each 'kidney' and Urban having 10 chrome white 
ones, as well as minor stuff such as black or chrome in places such as the 
front bumper trimmings and door mirrors. They're all customisable though, and 
you can choose which element you want to add or delete from your One.<br>
<br>

<strong>Interior</strong> <br>
<br>
 One of the major criticisms of the 
previous 1 Series was its interior packaging, specifically with regards to rear 
passenger space and its boot. It may have five doors, but it might as well have 
been a coupe.

How many drivers actually spend more time looking at 
their cars than the time spent on driving?<br>
<br>
 Behind the wheel of a BMW, 
the twisty roads in Malaysia will definitely put a smile on the face of the 
driver.<br>
<br>
 BMW, is still the ultimate driving machine. <br>
