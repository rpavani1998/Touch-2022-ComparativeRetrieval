<p>2012 BMW X3: Bump it Up</p> 
<p> By John DiPietro | March 16, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (15)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>While engaging in a rare driving condition recently (an open freeway in 
L.A.) I engaged the X3's cruise control. This is when I noticed the cruise's 
bump up/down feature. I know some other luxury brands offer this feature and it 
comes in handy, especially when traveling on freeways where the speed limit can 
fluctuate between 65 and 70.</p> 
<p>The X3's cruise speed up/down button (rocker switch on left wheel spoke) 
works like an auto down/up power window switch. Push it lightly and you can 
adjust the speed by one or more mph, depending on how long you hold it there. 
Press it briefly and beyond the initial travel (through the &quot;click&quot;) 
and the preset speed automatically moves up or down to the next multiple of 
5mph.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: All-American?</p> 
<p> By Albert Austria | March 15, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (19)<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>BMW Manufacturing Co in Spartanburg, SC, produced its first vehicle, a 
318i,&nbsp;on September, 8, 1994. BMW has since&nbsp;produced over 2 million 
vehicles and has invested over $5 billion at that U.S. plant.</p> 
<p>Our long-term 2012 BMW X3 was built in the Spartanburg plant, along with 
the X5 and X6 SUVs (Z4 production was moved from Spartanburg in August 2008.) 
In fact, all X3s -- regardless of the country for which&nbsp;they're destined 
--&nbsp;are built in Spartanburg. Additionally, the new X3 was designed in 
California.</p> 
<p>So, considering&nbsp;all the recent&nbsp;fuss about Chrysler and the Clint 
Eastwood&nbsp;Superbowl ad,&nbsp;does that make the new X3 an American car? 
Does that even matter to you?</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Rear Cupholders</p> 
<p> By Donna DeRosa | March 14, 2012 </p> <br>

<p>adavis2493 asked about the rear cupholders in the BMW X3. When you lower 
the center console in the rear seat, you can access two pop-up cupholders. 
There are no cupholders in the back of the front center console. So, if you 
have a third passenger who is sitting in the middle, you are out of luck.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Do the Lights Make a Difference? </p> 
<p> By Ed Hellwig | March 12, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (14)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>You may have noticed a greater number of new vehicles with odd looking 
headlights. It's a trend that BMW largely started awhile back with its corona 
ring design, quickly followed up by Audi and its LEDs. Now, just about vehicle 
has some signature light cue up front, some more interesting than others.</p> 
<p>Our X3 has BMW's latest take on headlight design and it's slightly more 
complicated version of its traditional design. The lights themselves work well 
and they don't look half bad when they're glowing eerily after you hit the 
unlock button.</p> 
<p>Made me wonder, though, how much the average buyer really cares. Do they 
really notice? Would they prefer to save the money as long as they could see 
well at night? Is this whole fancy light fad something that will fade away as 
quickly as it came about?</p> 
<p>Hard to tell as this point, although as LEDs become more flexible, the 
designs are only going to get more complicated. So much for changing a bulb in 
front of the auto parts store.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Bullseye for the Bimmer</p> 
<p> By John DiPietro | March 12, 2012 </p> <br>

<p>I noticed this defroster detail on the X3. Usually, the defroster's heating 
elements (the orange lines) run horizontally across the rear window. As you can 
see, the X3's are arranged in concentric fashion, echoing the sweep of the 
wiper. Although it may not make much difference from a strictly functional 
perspective, aesthetically it's a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: No Need for Additional Sport</p> 
<p> By Ed Hellwig | March 9, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (8)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Our X3 is equipped with BMW's Driving Dynamics Control (DDC) system which 
bundles various adjustments together into driver selectable normal, sport and 
sport+ modes.<br>
</p> 
<p>There's only one real problem with the system -- it's not really needed. 
Driving around in &quot;normal&quot; mode I never once felt the need to sporty 
things up a little. This X3 is very much a 3 Series on stilts, so it turns, 
accelerates and stops like a small sport sedan.<br>
</p> 
<p>I've generally been of the opinion that a well-tuned 
suspension/transmission/throttle setup shouldn't really need or even offer 
adjustments. Just get it right and leave it there. There are instances where 
it's nice to soften the ride up a little or quicken up the shift speed on the 
transmission, but it's often very subtle. I tried the Sport and Sport+ modes on 
our X3 and didn't find them much better than the &quot;normal&quot; mode. Maybe 
if we had the Dynamic Handling Package it would be different, but I doubt it.

<p>2012 BMW X3: Silent Connection</p> 
<p> By Caroline Pardilla | March 8, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (2)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>I mentioned before in a Fiat 500 post that I really dislike it when cars' 
Bluetooth systems ask you to record a name for your phone. Kind of a tedious 
process. Plus who, besides reality stars, likes the sound of their own voice?
<br> </p> 
<p>That's why I have to tip my hat to cars, like our 2012 BMW X3, that 
automatically detect your phone's name when you connect it. See? The technology
<i>is </i>there. <br>
</p> 
<p>Only thing that would make the X3's system even better is if it, like the 
Fiat, didn't have a limited number of slots to fill. But I'm sure that's an 
issue families wouldn't take umbrage with.</p> 
<p>For a compelling video on how easy it is to connect an iPhone, hit the 
jump. Personally, I like that BMW hasowner's manual videos.<br>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Caution: Filling May Be Hot</p> 
<p> By John DiPietro | March 8, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (20)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>After popping the X3's hood to check the oil (before realizing it has an 
electronic oil level monitor), this warning showed up both within the 
instrument cluster and on the navi's monitor. The boxed-in area where an 
internal<i>combustion</i> engine resides can be hot? Who knew?<br>
<br>
Next 
thing you know, you'll see warnings on coffee cups cautioning java junkies that 
indeed that beverage is hot...<br>
<br>
Kidding aside, it's nice to know that 
BMW cares.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Sorry for the above blurry photo of my friend Matt and his girlfriend 
playing with our long-term 2012 BMW X3's center armrest. But I had to capture 
the moment when tech-savvy, 20-something Matt couldn't figure out that this was 
a mobile phone dock. I mean, he uses an iPad as his store's cash register!</p>

<p>Thinking About Another Long Drive...</p> 
<p> By Mike Magrath | March 2, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (48)<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;In October of 2009, I spent some 10 days driving our 2009 Ford Flex 
from sea to shining sea. And now I'm thinking of doing it again. This one's not 
set in stone and it's only about 50% possible at this point.</p> 
<p>Let's go with the assumption that all of the hurdles go away and I can take 
another LT car cross country. Which should it be? And why? Should it be the A8L 
even though Scott's already taken it to Detroit? The X3? The Camry? It's got 
surprisingly good range.</p> 
<p>What say you?</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Just Because</p>

<br>

<p> While loading some bags into the cargo area of our longterm 2012 BMW X3, I 
took a quick scan of its various features. Elastic strap thingie, stationary 
tiedown anchors, sliding tiedown anchors, flip-down grocery bag hooks, 
watertight well&nbsp;(lower right), AC &nbsp;12v power outlet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Wait, doesn't this thing have run-flats?</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Meh</p> 
<p> By Dan Frio | February 29, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (21)<br>
<br>

<p> <i>(An appropriate gear for any 3-Series.)</i></p> 
<p>That's how I thought I'd feel after driving our X3 for the first time. Last 
time I drove one, more than a year ago, it was nice and steady and competent. 
And totally forgettable. Actually, I take that back. The X3 was pretty 
memorable for its inebriated throttle response and the subtlety of its 
Efficient Dynamics initiative (only a sticker on each rear window and the 
blue/red fill gauge monitoring my eco habits every time I lifted off-throttle).
</p> 
<p>I wanted to be underwhelmed - especially after driving the new F30 sedan 
and soaking up the new turbo-four and revised chassis.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Now That's a Nice Screen</p> 
<p> By Donna DeRosa | February 28, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (4)<br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>As I mentioned yesterday, our Mazda 3 has one of my least favorite map 
screens. Our 2012 BMW X3's&nbsp;is my current favorite in our fleet. The screen 
has&nbsp;rich color, the picture&nbsp;is large enough to show more than the 
half block I happen to be on, and it has plenty of room to show street names 
even when zoomed pretty far out. It also offers nice perspective and can be 
customized to your viewing preferences.</p> 
<p>Our X3 costs&nbsp;twice the price of our Mazda 3, so you naturally get 
twice the screen.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: Long Day in the Desert</p> 
<p> By Dan Edmunds | February 27, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (11)<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is one of the better and more established roads our 2012 BMW X3 
traversed this&nbsp;past Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As some of you know, one of my hobbies is a geeky GPS-based activity 
called&nbsp;geocaching. A group of eleven of us piled into three vehicles and 
headed out into the undeveloped triangle of open desert between highway 395, 
highway 58 and Interstate 15 for a day of short hikes split up by&nbsp;miles 
and miles of driving on faint tracks&nbsp;that barely register on&nbsp;aerial 
photographs and satellite images. Our plan was to visit 300 caches.</p> 
<p>Along the way we encountered sand, rocks, and the three w's of the desert: 
washboard, washouts and whoop-de-doos. But&nbsp;at least this area's very 
sparse rainfall and a tendency for high winds keeps the size of the plants in 
this area down to where the paint wasn't at much risk --&nbsp;if I was careful.

<p>2012 BMW X3: You Stay Here While I Go Over There</p> 
<p> By Dan Edmunds | February 23, 2012 </p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sorry, 2012 BMW X3. You'll have to wait here. No, you haven't done anything 
wrong. It's&nbsp;just that, well, I've never driven one of THOSE before and I 
don't know when I'll get another chance.</p> 
<p>Thanks for carrying me out to Auto Club Speedway, and all&nbsp;-- and my 
helmet. You've earned a break. Why not chill out and cool down? I'll find 
you&nbsp;some nice shade.</p> 
<p>Wait, what? No, I didn't know I was going to need it. I just carry it along 
sometimes. Relax. I'll be gone no more than an&nbsp;hour...or four. Promise.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3: I Don't Trust the Guide</p> 
<p> By Ed Hellwig | February 20, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (15)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>Now that rear view backup cameras are all the rage these days, nearly every 
manufacturer is trying to come up with its own twist on the idea. In the case 
of our X3, BMW provides these handy guide lines that show the immediate space 
behind the vehicle if you back straight up and yet another set of guidelines 
that depict where it will end up if you crank the wheel one way or the other.
</p> 
<p>I have no idea how the vehicle calculates this, nor do I do I know if 
they're at all accurate. The one thing I do know is that I don't really trust 
them much. If I was planning to back up into the carport space above there's no 
way I would assume that the red line is correct. Instead, I would go slow, look 
over shoulder, adjust my line as I went in and largely ignore whatever the 
guide on the screen said.</p> 
<p>Maybe I'm just paranoid, or distrustful of technology. Either way, there's 
no doubt I'm going to turn around and look for myself. Other drivers might not 
feel the same way and find these guide invaluable. I have yet to meet one, 
though, and doubt I ever will.</p>

<p>2012 BMW X3's Handy Rear Lock Feature That the A8 May/May Not Have</p> 
<p> By Caroline Pardilla | February 16, 2012 </p> <br>
Comments (15)<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>I really like this feature in our 2012 BMW X3; that you can just hit that 
lock button which will not only lower and close the liftgate for you, but will 
also lock up the car. I like it because I don't have to dig out the key fob in 
my Bermuda Triangle of a purse to secure the car. And it's especially 
appreciated when my hands are already occupied with groceries or the like and I 
can't reach the key fob.</p> 
<p>Out of&nbsp;curiosity, I checked out other long-termers that had that 
automatic-closing tailgate feature to see if they offered the same locking 
convenience. Turns out the Nissan Quest doesn't but I think our Audi A8L does. 
The reason I'm not sure is because<i>sometimes </i>when I hit that Close 
Tailgate button the Audi will make that sharp, high-pitched beep that the car 
is locked but it won't do this every time.</p> 
<p>I tried hitting the button and walking a little bit aways. Nope. I then 
tried just standing there til the lid closed. Nope. And then another time when 
I wasn't thinking about it, it did lock the car. Heh?</p> 
<p>I checked the Audi's manual to see if it would clarify how you can lock the 
car by just hitting that close button but all itsaid was &quot;Press the button 
in the rear lid. The rear lid moves to the closed position by itself and soft 
close locks it automatically.&quot; M'kay. What am I missing?</p>

<p>Our long-term 2012 BMW X3 xDrive35i (say that 5x fast) has a fancy-pants 
back-up camera system. Fancy, in that you can personalize several of the 
settings throught the iDrive controller.</p> 
<p>The back-up camera is part of the Technology Package&nbsp;that 
will&nbsp;debit your checking account<br>
