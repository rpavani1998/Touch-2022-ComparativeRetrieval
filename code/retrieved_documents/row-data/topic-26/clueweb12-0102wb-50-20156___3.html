<p>When you desire a luxury car but want more exclusivity and style, the 
four-door coupes four-doors with coupe-like profiles segment awaits. In the 
recently created class, theMercedes-Benz CLS-Class is now joined by the Audi 
A7, BMW 640i Gran Coupe, and Jaguar XF if you discount the more affordable
Volkswagen CC and Hyundai Sonata.</p> 
<p>With basic pricing information released on the BMW 640i Gran Coupe, we 
thought it was time to give this segment another look. Like the Mercedes-Benz 
CLS and Jaguar XF, BMW approaches this segment with a sedan bodystyle, unlike 
the Audi A7 hatchback. What brings together these four entries are a focus on 
exterior style, interior craftsmanship, and a price that assures you 
won&rsquo;t be seeing 10 of them at the local Whole Foods market. Let&rsquo;s 
take a look at what $80,000 will buy you at your local BMW, Mercedes-Benz, 
Audi, and Jaguar dealerships.</p> 
<p><strong>2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe</strong> &ndash; $76,895 base price 
&ndash; The 640i Gran Coupe&rsquo;s near-$80,000 starting price surprisingly 
places this BMW in the same price range as the V-8 powered Mercedes-Benz 
CLS550. The 640i Gran Coupe is powered by a 315-hp turbocharged inline 
six-cylinder engine.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>2012 Mercedes-Benz CLS550</strong> &ndash; $72,175 base price 
&ndash; Thanks to a low price compared to the BMW, an $80,000 budget actually 
allows for some perusing of Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s long options list. Why not 
indulge in the CLS550&prime;s available full LED headlights?</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>2012 Audi A7 Prestige</strong> &ndash; $66,455 base price &ndash; 
Even the top trim 2012 Audi A7 trim level costs less than $70,000. That lower 
base price opens up possibilities like the Audi A7&prime;s optional $5900 
1300-watt sound system and still have a few dollars left over.</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>2012 Jaguar XF Supercharged</strong> &ndash; $68,975&nbsp; base 
price &ndash; Though not as purpose-built for this class as the others, the 
newly refreshed 2012 Jaguar XF has plenty of style and, when supercharged, 
delivers 470 hp from its V-8 and a 0-60 mph time of under 5 seconds. Plus, 
unlike the BMW 640i Gran Coupe and Audi A7, the Jaguar XF is only offered in 
the U.S. with V-8 powerplants.</p> 
<p><strong>If you were ready to buy an $80,000 premium coupe-like sedan, would 
you choose a BMW 640i Gran Coupe, Audi A7, Mercedes-Benz CLS550, Jaguar XF, or 
look elsewhere?</strong> Tell us what you&rsquo;d choose in the comments

<p>The A7 is ugly. (Don&rsquo;t write back it&rsquo;s not, if you like it 
great.)<br>
 The XF is beautiful but might have reliability issues.<br>
 The 6 
feels big and heavy.<br>
 I&rsquo;d choose the CLS.</p> <br>

<p>1) MB CLS550<br>
 2) Porsche Panamera<br>
 3) Jag &ndash; Because it is 
Supercharged!<br>
 4) Audi<br>
 5) Bimmer &ndash; But I would buy an M5 over a 
6 GC</p> <br>

<p>In order of preference</p> 
<p>1. Gran Coupe<br>
 2.CLS 550<br>
 3. Jag XFR<br>
 4. A7</p> <br>

<p>These cars are NOT in the same price category. The Audi&rsquo;s base price 
for the PRESTIGE version is $66K, and comes with 6K worth of bundled options 
compared to the Premium version ($59K). The Mercedes and BMW&rsquo;s base price 
is truly base, and doesn&rsquo;t include any options.</p> 
<p>When comparably equipped, the CLS it would be close to 20K more expensive 
that the A7 or Jag.</p> 
<p>Money being no option the CLS would win, but the fact that the much cheaper 
and better looking (IMHO) Audi is considered a direct competitor shows how much 
value it offers.</p> 
<p>A much more accurate comparison would be the CLS550, BMW 650GS, Jag XFR, 
and Audi S7.</p> <br>

<p>Lloyd Banks said the only choices are &ldquo;BIMMER,BENZ,or BENTLEY&rdquo;. 
So Jag and Audi are off the list. I&rsquo;m not Kanye or Jay-Z so no Bentley. 
Benz breaks down more often than Bimmers do. So i&rsquo;ll take the Bimmer. 
It&rsquo;s &ldquo;The ultimate driving machine&rdquo; for a reason right. LoL

<p>if the BMW is available with a manual, it would be first, the Jaguar 
second, the Audi third and the Mercedes last. For the money in this price range 
though, my first pick would be a CTS-V wagon.</p> <br>

<p>I would take the Audi hands down. KBB just gave out their version of the 
most reliable award and Audi won in the luxury division. Plus with standard AWD 
and a There would be no way i would touch a new BMW. If you are going to pay 
almost 70K or more i want a car that i don&rsquo;t have to constantly keep 
getting repaired.</p> 
<p>The Jag looks nice and i have heard their reliability is going up. The 
older Jags were in the shop every 2 weeks. The Benz just looks too rounded.</p>

<p>The BMW looks very overpriced when matched up with these cars. All of the 
other three offer far more for your money: more style, more power, more tech, 
more everything.</p> 
<p>Regardless of which you like, there really isn&rsquo;t a wrong 
choice&hellip; except the bimmer.</p> <br>

<p>The base Panamera is under $80K, so that&rsquo;s valid. If they 
hadn&rsquo;t mentioned the $80K cap, I&rsquo;d take the Quattroporte in a 
heartbeat. You can pick up a low-mileage &rsquo;09 for under $80 &ndash; does 
that count?</p> <br>

<li> Cvega Posted on: February 10, 2012&nbsp;7:51 am Reply <br>

<p>The Quatroporte to me looks dated. The front looks a bit like an older 
Buick . I like the coupe though.</p> <br>

<p>The GranTurismo is just beautiful! And, you&rsquo;re right, the

<p>Of course the Jag! The audi is droopy and looks tired, the BMW is plain and 
simple hideous, and the MB is extremely boring, especially compared to the one 
that came before it. Meanwhile the Jaguar has a striking presence and looks 
more like the XJ, which I think is one of the most beautiful cars there is 
right now.</p> <br>

<p>The XF without hesitation, its interior makes the BMW look like trash

<p>This is a no-brainer. The A7 is the class of the field. The modern design,

<p>A7 hands down, true all these cars are stunning in there own way but the A7 
looks smooth. The Mercedes looks a little over done, the 6 looks surprisingly 
like the 5 which is a disappointment and whats truly shocking is that the Jag 
is the least attractive out of this group (its still more attractive than 98% 
of the other cars on the market). But I digress, the traditional Audi styling 
cues make for a car that looks equal parts calm and vicious which is awesome.

<p>I&rsquo;m a big BMW fan, but not a fan of the Gran Coupe. I&rsquo;m stuck 
between the A7 and XF (CLS I&rsquo;d downright ugly). Both the Jag and the Audi 
looks astonishing, and have beautiful interiors, but aren&rsquo;t sluggers. If 
I could get the keys to any of this two I would be more than glad.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Mr. Lexus, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised you gave the Audi &ldquo;throwaway 
thirds.&rdquo; You have a real hard on for Audi&rsquo;s. I am just curious what 
is that you don&rsquo;t like about them whatsoever? Did you have a bad 
experience with it? You should go drive the A7, you&rsquo;ll be surprised how 
great of a car it is.<br>
 I like your comment on the Lexus forum that, 
&ldquo;The Audi has zero style. They praised the gaping hole in its face?&rdquo;
<br> That comment by itself discredits everything you say. How does Audi have 
ZERO STYLE??? You&rsquo;re telling me the Lexus has more style than Audi? I can 
see maybe Mercedes, BMW or the Jag being almost on even ground, and in some 
cases surpassing Audi in style. As for the &ldquo;gaping hole,&rdquo; I am 
assuming you&rsquo;re talking about the grill?? If so, have you seen the grill 
on the new Lexus, they are trying really hard not to make it look like they 
copied Audi&rsquo;s big black grill by pinching in the top corners of the grill 
and widening the bottom a little.<br>
 It&rsquo;s ok to not like the same cars 
as others and intelligently critique them, but your comments are more about 
bashing other brands just because you don&rsquo;t like them. I am sure 
you&rsquo;re a young kid and trying to be cool.</p> <br>

<p>I was leaning towards the jaguar but the interior looks bad compare to the 
others. The bmw has the best interior but the six cylinders is a deal breaker. 
I never care for audi so by default ill take the Mercedes but i don&rsquo;t 
like how they have a steering wheel gear lever makes me thing of a big truck or 
SUV. One thing that bothers me is how Mercedes always has under power motors 
compare to to the competition. And how do they only get that little power out 
that engine beats me??? they can do that with the same engine size but N/A</p>

<p>I would take the XF, then the CLS, then the A7, then the 6 Gran Coupe. But 
it&rsquo;s not really fair because the XF is in a different segment altogether. 
Although it is on par with looks which is what they were getting at I guess.</p>

<p>The cls of course. If I&rsquo;m shelling 80k, I gotta have a v8, black on 
blaCk baby.</p> <br>

<p>I would go with the A7.<br>
 The others are very good looking as 
well&hellip;except the BMW. Looks too bulky and never really liked the 6 series.

<p>The Benz CLS without question. It&rsquo;s the meanest-looking, has the best 
combo of engine power and efficiency, and it&rsquo;s somehow faster than the 
Jag even with 70 less hp.</p> 
<p>The A7 and 640i both have weak 6cyl powertrains (compared to the motors in 
the Jag and Benz) and the Jag&rsquo;s grace is beginning to fade due to its 
aging design. Its dashboard also looks like it was designed in the 90s</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;d get the CLS in a heartbeat. A beautiful black one pulled next to 
me and It was so stunning to see. I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few in the day 
including some AMG&rsquo;S, but these look unworldy at night. Just so damn 
gorgeous. Next I&rsquo;d pick the Bimmer. The other two are somewhat irrelevant.

<li> CasJackson Posted on: February 10, 2012&nbsp;5:04 am <br>

<p>UNDER $80K. The M6 &amp; CLS63, will without a doubt pass that price tag. 
And the S7 will at least be $10k more than the Jag.</p> <br>

<p>The CLS. It&rsquo;s the most luxurious, the best-looking (in my opinion, 
but that&rsquo;s my taste), and is much classier. If not, then the sporty XF.

<p>If I had the means to afford one of these, I&rsquo;d buy something else (a 
new 300 and used Z06 sounds about right), but of them, I gotta go with the 
Jaguar XF Supercharged. No way I&rsquo;m spending what these super hardtop 
sedans cost and not getting the most powerful one !!</p> <br>

<p>If the decision were left to me, I would be in agonizing pain trying to 
decide between the A7 and the CLS550. Both are so beautiful.</p> <br>

<p>all of these luxury cars are fantastic. if i had to choose i would go with 
the audi, the best looker, and most likely lease it.</p> <br>

<p>Jaguar XF any day. It&rsquo;s by far the best looking and it has so much 
more class than the others. The Bimmer looks hideous (like all other BMWs), the 
Mercedes lost its graceful looks when it was redesigned, and the Audi is 
downright ugly (especially the back end).</p> <br>

<p>Wow, you obviously have no taste in cars whatsoever. The Mercedes CLS 
looked hideous before the redesign and how the hell is the Audi ugly? You, my 
friend, need to go somewhere where the only thing you see is darkness. The 
Jaguar most definitely doesn&rsquo;t have more class and while it is good 
looking, it is not at all better looking than the others. BMWs are not hideous, 
go take your comments somewhere else.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the 420 hp S7 competes with the 440 hp 6 grand sport 
and 429 hp CLS550.</p> 
<p>The RS7 with a 520+ twin turbo V8 would be more fitting to the cars you 
mention.</p> <br>
