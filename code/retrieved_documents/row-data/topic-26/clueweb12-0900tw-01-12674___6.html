<h1>Audi to buy Ducati &ndash; the four rings expands from four wheels</h1> 
<p> By Georg Kacher</p> 
<p> Motor Industry</p> 
<p> 12 March 2012 09:50</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Audi has struck an exclusive deal giving it first rights to buy Italian 
superbike manufacturer Ducati, CAR can reveal.<br>
<br>
The exclusivity deal 
gives Audi until mid April when the deal will likely be finalised, according to 
high-ranking sources contact by CAR.</p> 
<p>Ducati's liabilities are around&nbsp;&euro;200 million [<em>earlier report 
said &euro;800 million, this has been corrected</em>], and our sources suggest 
the total purchase price is about &euro;250m-&euro;300m.</p> 
<p>This is a bold move by Audi, which sees the long-term advantage in moving 
into two wheels as well as four.</p> 
<h2>Why is Audi buying Ducati?</h2> 
<p>It's all part of Project Eagle, another brainchild of Volkswagen group 
scion Ferdinand Piech. He has been eyeing up the opportunity of buying a 
prestigious motorcycle brand for some time, and considered reviving Horex, a 
German motorbike firm which made single- and twin-cylinder bikes from 1936 to 
1956.</p> 
<p>But Horex doesn't have enough brand recognition, so when Bologna-based 
Ducati came up for sale the VW Group paid close attention. Especially since 
Mercedes-Benz recently entered into a cross-promotional deal with Ducati.</p> 
<p>Ducati, which makes around 40,000 motorcycles a year, is on the market 
since its debt burden is reportedly higher than its revenues.</p> 
<h2>Who else might buy Ducati?</h2> 
<p>India's Mahindra and Hero, Daimler and Volkswagen are said to be among the 
leading suitors, but CAR can reveal that Audi has struck an exclusivity deal 
giving it first dibs on Ducati.</p> 
<p>A small team of advisors has been formed in Ingolstadt under the Project 
Eagle name and they're currently doing due diligence on the Ducati deal. 
According to our insiders, there is no way Audi will pay telephone numbers for 
Ducati. Instead, the Germans will probably put no more than &euro;50m to 
&euro;100m on the table - but absorb the new partner's substantial liabilities.
</p> 
<p>Ducati chairman Andrea Bonomi has in the past pointed out that he views 
'Ducati as the two-wheel equivalent of Audi', a perception Ferdinand Piech 
would likely agree with. In 2008, Piech said it was a mistake not to have 
bought Ducati when the company was on the brink of brankruptcy before. Four 
years later, Volkswagen is now closer then ever to making the chairman's vision 
complete.</p> 
<p>But first of all, the Audi delegation must take a deep dive into the Ducati 
R&amp;D department and check out the Borgo Panigale production facility. After 
all, it takes more than a strong name to make Project Eagle fly.</p> <strong>

<p>Jose - I see your logic.&nbsp; It is th only possible reason for this 
bizarre deal.&nbsp; That and to stop Mercedes getting hold of Ducati.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brankruptcy?&nbsp; Georg's English is far better than my German but this 
shouldn't slip through...</p>

<p>Strange! Nobody see the reason to Audi buy Ducati?<br>
 OK, it will be good 
to Ducati future. And I like Ducati bikes, the Ducati brand deserves a good 
future.<br>
 Returning to the point. Audi is all the times following BMW (and 
sometimes also following Mercedes), in all projects, in all new models, in 
everything. So as BMW have BMW motorrad, bikes, Audi also needs to have it.<br>

 Fortunately BMW is not a follower of Audi (VW group owns VW commercial 
vehicles, Scania and MAN) if not BMW will buy a truck company.<br>

<p>As a non-biker I would have thought Ducati was the 2-wheeled 
Ferrari.&nbsp;&nbsp; Audi?&nbsp; I don't see the links in brand, technoligy or 
customer base.&nbsp; Now putting together Lambhorghini and Ducati. that makes 
more sense.</p>

<p>I guess Lamborghini have done okay under Audi, so shouldnt be too much to 
worry about.&nbsp; If it saves Ducati and we keep getting great products, its 
job done.</p>
