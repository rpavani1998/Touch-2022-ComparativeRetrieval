<p><b>Search Engine Navigator: Yahoo's Back!</b><br>
Shawn Campbell<br>
<br>

</p>I was all set to write an article predicting the future of search engines, 
when Yahoo dropped Google and replaced it with its own engine. Now that's big 
news. In less than twenty-four hours, Google went from about 79% of the market 
share to about 51%, almost overnight. And what a welcome relief it is too! 
Being #1 in Google was great, but when you had the misfortune of dropping even 
a couple of positions you really felt it. Now there will be more stability; if 
you drop in Google today, your hits from Yahoo will remain consistent.
<p><b>What is the new Yahoo?</b></p> 
<p>Last year, Yahoo bought the AltaVista, Fast, and Inktomi search engines. 
The new Yahoo results are none of these. Many people are saying that the 
results come from a new Inktomi because the results are similar; but the 
results are also similar to all the other search engines out there. In 
comparing these engines, it seems to me that Yahoo's results are from a brand 
new engine. Maybe they took parts and ideas from all the search engines they 
bought - maybe they even took the best parts - , but whatever they did, the 
result is something completely new.</p> 
<p><b>Which search engine is better?</b></p> 
<p>I will be comparing Google and Yahoo for the terms &quot;music&quot;, 
&quot;art prints and posters&quot;, &quot;Bahamas real estate&quot;, 
&quot;mosquito nets&quot;, and &quot;liposuction&quot;. The other search 
engines all hold less than 4% of the market share (except for MSN which uses 
Yahoo's Inktomi), so I won't be considering them. Here is what I found in the 
top 10 results for each keyphrase:</p> 
<p><b>Music</b></p> 
<p>Yahoo offers a lot of music resource sites. Information about music from 
different sources such as magazine, TV and other music news sites are found 6 
times in the top 10 results. It also offered downloading and file sharing 
programs 3 times. The 10th result was an audio player program site.</p> 
<p>Google has a lot more diversity. There were 3 music resource sites (but no 
magazines), one downloading program, one CD store, one radio station (Yahoo 
radio), one music directory, and the 10th result was an audio player program 
site. Google also had 2 sites in its top ten that were of no value whatsoever; 
MP3.com which just has one page stating that they no longer offer the services 
that they used to (with links to their parent company), and music.com, which is 
nothing more than an email gathering site for a newsletter (not a single link 
on the entire page).</p> 
<p>Google's diversity is a big bonus, but the 2 spam/junk/useless sites really 
hurt it. The results? Yahoo 1, Google 0.</p> 
<p><b>Art Prints And Posters</b></p> 
<p>Yahoo offers 6 stores, while Google offers 5. The other links are all 
affiliate spam with no content whatsoever (just links to stores), with the 
exception of one of Yahoo's links, which has some biographical content about 
artists. So Google has 5 spam sites, and Yahoo has 3 and a half.</p> 
<p>Yet another round goes to Yahoo.</p> 
<p><b>Bahamas Real Estate</b></p> 
<p>For this keyphrase, I found results between Google and Yahoo to be quite 
similar. The only differences were sites by actual realtors and sites that were 
simply property listings. Both types of results are useful, with Google having 
an edge in realtors. Google had some lower quality sites, but the information 
was just as good even though they did seem less professional. On the other 
hand, Yahoo did have one site that was nothing more than a links page from 
another realtor's site. Big boo boo.</p> 
<p>This one goes to Google.</p> 
<p><b>Mosquito Nets</b></p> 
<p>It seems to me that someone searching for &quot;mosquito nets&quot; wants 
either A) to buy them, or B) to learn about them, so I was expecting to find 
either stores or information about mosquito nets. Yahoo showed me 6 stores and 
2 informational pages. The other results were a search result page (not a good 
result) and an inner page from a previous result (also not a good result).</p> 
<p>Google gave me 7 stores and 3 charitable organizations (one of which was a 
store as well). The other 2 charitable organizations were a news article 
outlining what they had done regarding mosquito nets and information about 
mosquito nets.</p> 
<p>So even though I didn't necessarily want the latest news about what a 
charity did regarding mosquito nets, I think getting the same site twice from 
Yahoo (not to mention the search result page) is the bigger no-no. Google wins 
this round.</p> 
<p><b>Liposuction</b></p> 
<p>I expected to find information about liposuction, liposuction organizations 
and either doctors or centers where you can have liposuction done. What I got 
was a lot of &quot;how to find a doctor&quot; sites, with a lot of good 
information.</p> 
<p>Yahoo results included 3 sites doubled. This is a problem that killed 
AltaVista in the late 90's. Hopefully they will have it fixed soon. Other than 
the 3 doubled sites, the results included 4 informational sites, 2 sites for 
finding doctors and one poorly written article about the history of liposuction.
</p> 
<p>Google gave me 4 good informational sites, 2 good &quot;find a doctor&quot; 
sites, one recent article about liposuction for people in the industry, one 
site with very poor information one written by a single doctor and one site 
that was nothing more than a directory.</p> 
<p>Google gets this round as well. Overall, it looks like Yahoo needs to fix 
its doubling of sites and Google needs to clean out some spam (poor sites).</p> 
<p><b>And The Winner Is...</b></p> 
<p>You! Having two good search engines to choose from makes searching that 
much better for everyone. It also makes getting listings better. It also makes 
marketing better. It also makes traffic to your site steadier. The only way 
this could have been worse is if Yahoo's results sucked, and they don't. They 
seem just as good, if not better, than Google's.</p> 
<p>So rejoice, and enjoy a more dynamic world of online searching!</p>
