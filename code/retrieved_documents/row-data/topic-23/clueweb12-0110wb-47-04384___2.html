<h1>Make Search Engines Work for You: Tips for Better Searches</h1> <br>
 
October 27, 2011  by Haley A. Lovett <br>
 No search engine is perfect, but 
armed with a few tips for better searching you can get great results out of 
(almost) any search engine. 
<h3> Tip 1: Use the Right Search Engine or Database </h3> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Search engines are not one-size-fits-all, and often finding the best result 
means starting in the right place. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to using Google, 
Yahoo and Bing; especially for academic research these common search engines 
might not be the best solution.<br>
<br>
 Choosing a search engine specific to 
your needs means you won&rsquo;t have to sift through pages of irrelevant 
results or inadequate sources during your search. Spending a little time 
finding the right search engine in the beginning could save you hours of 
searching later.<br>
<br>
 Take a look at the Choosing a Search Engine Web Guide
 to discover search engines that specialize in delivering academic and 
trustworthy results, or try the findingDulcinea search engineSweetSearch for a 
student-safe search environment.<br>
<br>
 The American Library 
Association&rsquo;s wikiTool Kit for the Expert Web Searcher lists Web search 
resources by topic area&mdash;news, blog, multimedia, etc.&mdash;this will be 
helpful if you or your students are looking for a particular type of online 
resource during your research.<br>
<br>

<h3> Tip 2: Choose Your Search Terms Wisely </h3>  A search engine is not 
human, and cannot read your mind. All it has to work with are the words that 
you enter into it, so choosing those words wisely is important.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 
WebQuest.org suggests having your students start by making a list ofwords that 
must, might or mustn&rsquo;t be in the search results&mdash;this can help you 
narrow down what search terms to use during your search.<br>
<br>
 If your 
search results still aren&rsquo;t exactly what you want, try theTips for Better 
Searches PDF&mdash;you can print it out and leave it by the computer for 
reference. This PDF will show you how to get fewer results using specific 
search terms, or get more results using general search terms. It also provides 
tips for improving search terms.<br>
<br>
 For more advanced students of 
search, understanding Boolean logic can greatly improve search results. 
You&rsquo;ve probably seen Boolean logic in use even if you don&rsquo;t 
recognize the term. It refers to AND, OR and other connecting words that help a 
search engine understand what you want. Visit Internet Tutorials&rsquo; Boolean 
Searching on the Internet resource for a quick introduction to using Boolean 
logic in searches. <br>
<br>

<h3> Tip 3: Ask for Help From the Search Engine </h3>  Tip 2 covered some ways 
that you can improve your searches on any search engine, but each engine has 
special tips and tricks of its own. Take a look at the help page of the search 
engine you are using to get advice about that particular engine.<br>
<br>
 
Using Google? There aremany advanced features that can help you get quick 
answers to a question. For example typing &ldquo;define:yourword&rdquo; will 
get you a list of definitions of your word.<br>
<br>

<h3> Tip 4: Learn How Search Engines Work, and Make Them Work for You </h3>  
Although the technology behind each search engine varies slightly, there are 
some basic things you can learn about how search engines work that can help you 
improve your search skills.<br>
<br>
 Our Guide to How Search Engines Work 
explains basic search technology, and also explains how some online companies 
manipulate search engines to favor their Web sites in the results. Reading more 
about search engine technology can help you and your students avoid unsavory 
search results.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<h3> Tip 5: Search Result #1 Isn&rsquo;t Always the Best </h3>  This is an 
important tip to keep in mind while searching. Most search engines are not 
making a recommendation that you use the first search result. The reason a 
result appears in the top spot after a search simply means that it is the best 
match to what you typed, not that it necessarily has the information you are 
looking for or is a credible or trustworthy site.<br>
<br>
 Explore many of the 
search results you are shown and decide for yourself what is the best resource 
to use. This might mean clicking through to the third, tenth or even twentieth 
page of search results (or modifying your search term and trying again). The 
search engine is only a helper, you are the researcher. <br>

<h3> Tip 6: If at First You Don&rsquo;t Succeed, Search and Search Again </h3> 
 If you aren&rsquo;t finding the results that you want, you have some options: 
search again using different search terms, try using search tips recommended by 
the search engine you are using, or even move on to a new search engine or 
database and start from the beginning. The information you seek is most likely 
somewhere online, so finding it will take creativity, and flexibility in your 
approach to research.<br>
