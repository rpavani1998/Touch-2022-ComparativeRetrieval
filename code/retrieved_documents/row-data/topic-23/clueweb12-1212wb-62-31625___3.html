<h2>GETTING BETTER SEARCH ENGINE RANKS IS ONE STEP TOWARDS A SALE</h2> <br>

<p>Research shows that over 60% of web users do not look beyond the first page 
of search engine results and 90% don't get beyond page two. So, if your site is 
languishing from page three down against your target keywords, you need better 
search engine ranks.<br>
<br>
 Before you start the process of search engine 
optimisation (SEO), it's essential to remember that better search engine ranks 
are a means to an end - not an end in themselves. Your objective is to get a 
human being to read your web pages, to be engaged by what you offer and to act. 
Too many SEO practitioners forget this critical fact - they look at what they 
believe the search engine software wants and cram their clients' content with 
keywords. The effect is to steer visitors away rather than to keep them on the 
site.</p> 
<p>You optimisation approach should be based on the principle that it's the 
visitor that counts, not the search engine, and that the content of the 
optimised page has to compel the visitor to act. Better search ranks are a 
means to an end - the end being a better sales conversion rate, which is 
achieved by attracting more of the right types of visitors.</p> 
<p>A recent survey showed that 60.5 percent of Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL 
users prefer the main listings (known as the organic listings) in the search 
results to the pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements. 60.8 percent of Yahoo and 
72.3 percent of Google search engine users say that organic search results are 
the most relevant. This means that you stand to lose a large percentage of 
potential clicks and relevant traffic if you do not have your website 
effectively search engine optimised. So don't be tempted by ridiculous promises 
and snake oil salesmen - hire a professional SEO company.</p>

<p><b><i>How do we get you better search engine ranks?</i></b></p> 
<p>If you've already got a website, we start by analysing how people are using 
it by checking your web analytics. You have got an analytics package haven't 
you? No? Well get one because if you're not tracking how people are using your 
site, you're shooting in the dark. Google offers an excellent package and it's 
free. You can sign up athttp://www.google.com/analytics/. </p> 
<p>Next we research how people are using the search engines in your market. We 
identify the actual words and phrases that people are using, not the ones that 
you think they might use. We then ensure that your site is built and structured 
so that the relevant content is fully accessible to the search engine spiders.
</p> 
<p>We'll make sure you have clear expectations about the likely results and a 
good understanding of how the Search Engine Ranking Positions (SERPs) can 
change over time. We will then work with you to create good quality content and 
to finalise the 'on-site' optimisation with sitemaps and title and description 
tags. After submitting your pages to the engines and specific, relevant 
directories, we wait for the search engine spiders to index the content.</p> 
<p>Any professional SEO company will emphasise the importance of 'off-site' 
optimisation or linking in getting better search engine ranks. Attracting 
inbound, one way links from well regarded relevant web pages is the biggest 
challenge in SEO. Unfortunately, it's also the single most important factor if 
you want your site to rank well in Google, the market leader.</p> 
<p>Incise is not just a service provider. We work as your responsible business 
development partner. Our knowledge of SEO techniques, search engine 
demographics, algorithms and sales conversion techniques make us a professional 
SEO company when it comes to getting better search engine ranks and promoting 
your business online.</p>
