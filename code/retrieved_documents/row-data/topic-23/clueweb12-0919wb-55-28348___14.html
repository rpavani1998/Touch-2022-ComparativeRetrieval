<h3>Yahoo Waves White Flag in Search War</h3> 
<p> Yahoo! has apparently read the writing on the search wall that everyone 
else (except Microsoft) has been reading for years: The search game is over and 
Google has won.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;We don't think it's reasonable to assume we're going to gain a lot of 
share from Google,&quot; Yahoo! CFO Sue Decker said in a Bloomberg article on 
Jan 23.&nbsp; &quot;It's not our goal to be No. 1 in Internet search. We would 
be very happy to maintain our market share.''</p> 
<p>Decker and Yahoo! get points for self-assessment and 
straightforwardness.&nbsp; And as neither she nor most of the company's current 
senior managers were there when Yahoo! fumbled the search ball back in the 90s 
(to go chasing after content and other seemingly sexier pursuits), it seems 
pointless to reiterate how disappointing this is, that the search game was once 
Yahoo!'s to lose.</p> 
<p>Still, denial never helps, so hats off.&nbsp; Now, if the folks up at 
Redmond can only follow this example, perhaps Yahoo! and MSN can combine forces 
and become a stronger No. 2.</p> 
<p>UPDATE: Upon further consideration, I think this comment was probably 
intended to reset Wall Street's expectations.&nbsp; The Street has been all 
over Yahoo about search for the last year, and the company's repeated promises 
to &quot;fix the algorithm&quot; have only created more disappointment.&nbsp; 
So Decker was presumably just resetting the bar to a level the company can more 
easily clear.&nbsp; (Judging from recent market share losses, though, even this 
target may be hard to meet.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Comments</h3> <br>

<p>Interesting take, but I am not convinced Yahoo! should be completely 
written off in terms of search. Even if Yahoo! maintains a strong number two 
showing, that will only compliment their strong &quot;stickiness&quot; of the 
other services offered.</p> 
<p>Personally, I think Google search is better, but I can not bring myself to 
switch my homepage from Yahoo!, which I have tried several time, I keep going 
back time and time again. I would venture to bet I am not along in this - and 
Yahoo! knows it.</p> 
<p>While Google is good, history has shown that the best stumble. I was 
reading an article online somewhere that Yahoo! is beating Google in the race 
for social networking &amp; social search. I don't know much about it, but it 
could be interesting to see in the long term.</p> 
<p>Keep the insights coming.</p> <br>

<p>I definitely don't think Yahoo! should be written off in search. As Sue 
Decker put it, though, I would be pleased and relieved if they could just 
maintain market share. Based on most of the data I've seen, they've lost share 
every quarter, including this latest one. And if the search market isn't to go 
the way of online auctions (effective monopoly), that trend has to stop.</p>

<p>Just today I published a Yahoo! Company Profile on my blog 
TheNewWallStreet.com. I mentioned the fact that they are second in the search 
industry, and I continued to write that this is not of major concern. They are 
diversified to the point, that they attract visitors with their content, 
services, and Web 2.0 initiatives. They are a firm second in the search field, 
far from an after thought, but can be successful focusing their business 
elsewhere. Check out my post and feel free to leave a comment...

<p>Leaving aside the question if the search competition is over (I dont think 
it is), it is certainly a good thing to be realistic internally and in making 
strategic decisions at the managment level. I am just not so sure it is great 
to say it publicly. I would imagine this would be pretty dicouraging to hear if 
you are on the Yahoo search development team, or really anyone inside Yahoo. It 
also cant help retaining or attracting top search talent. I would bet there is 
some significant damage control going on in the Yahoo R&amp;D organization 
today.</p> <br>

<p>PS - Maybe this is a trick to get Google to relax and let its guard down. 
</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Nabil | January 24, 2006 at 03:14 PM </p> <br>

<p>Sue Decker is about as smart as they come. This said, I doubt it's a 
&quot;trick&quot; to get Google to relax so much as an attempt to manage Wall 
Street expectations. The Street has been all over Yahoo about its relative 
search incompetence, and Yahoo has spent the last year promising to &quot;fix 
the algorithm&quot; and give Google a run for its money. I suspect the new 
strategy, with respect to Street communications, is to try to set the bar low 
and then clear it easily. The trouble is, given recent trends, I don't think 
it's going to be easy for Yahoo to even maintain share.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Henry Blodget | January 24, 2006 at 04:20 PM </p> <br>

<p>It's only a matter of time before China funds a search engine company that 
will reduce Google to rubble.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: JD | January 24, 2006 at 04:43 PM </p> <br>

<p>Yeah, but I'm not exactly sure that it matters that much either. Yahoo's 
future lies in a different place, as the No1 destination site /portal.</p> 
<p>And they'll get a chance to reinvent the search game around social 
networking.</p> 
<p>I believe both Yahoo and Google have great futures but also different 
futures.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: techboard | January 24, 2006 at 04:54 PM </p> <br>

<p>I am a little bit puzzled as this is a comment by their CFO and not by 
their R&amp;D chief, Dr. Prabhakar Raghavn. In any case Yahoo lacks innovation.
</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: patil | January 24, 2006 at 05:35 PM </p> <br>

<p>One thing I learned long ago is never assume. Oh, and never think the trend 
will continue. Oh, and and and.</p> 
<p>The reality of the internet business is that change is at lightning speed. 
Just a handful of years ago, how many people had heard of Google? I am far from 
an internet neophyte yet I never really started using Google over Yahoo for 
search until after the IPO. Now we are writing off Yahoo, Microsoft and any 
potential innovators. Hmmm. Maybe.</p> 
<p>I am a little less sanguine about Google, Yahoo and the sorts than others. 
How good a CEO is Semel? How capable are the Google founders? Yesterday Semel 
was a genius now two geeks are the geniuses. The reality is neither likely fit 
the label. Yahoo was the anti-Microsoft force. There was literally little, if 
any, well funded competition. So they thrived. Did they make the right 
decisions, have a good business strategy and execute extremely well? It appears 
not. Because all it took was a second well funded competitor to eat their lunch 
in a period of a few short years.</p> 
<p>Now, we look at Google. At least they are focused. That's a hell of a lot 
more than I can say for Yahoo. What does Yahoo really want to be? I do like 
looking at the hot chicks on their Personals. But, I just look at the pictures. 
I don't spend any money. Back to Google. Focused. They do one thing. I could 
argue they do it better than anyone else but they aren't particularly good at 
it. Not search. What they get paid for. And while I love the Google work 
environment they have created, I'm not sure the founders are really proven 
business strategists or executives. Diller says they fell into this and had a 
back up plan to sell the business for a song if things didn't work. So, is 
Diller telling the truth? Or are Sergey and whatever his name is really 
brilliant? I'd argue as business people, they don't seem to be. What experience 
do I have making that statement? I've spent the majority of my career advising 
Fortune 500 C-level execs on business strategy and transformation. I'm no 
rocket scientist but I've see this story before.</p> 
<p>In a world where the majority of talent, creativity and revenue lie outside 
of your company, successful business execs learn to create win-win 
relationships. Google is on a General Sherman scorched earth advance. They are 
lining up enemies in every facet of business including the customer ranks.</p> 
<p>So, with many potential pitfalls, a less than proven management team and 
one significant source of revenue that they aren't all that good at-just better 
than anyone else-will they be successful?</p> 
<p>Let's see what happens when the next Google comes along. </p> 
<p> </p> <br>

<p> Posted by: B | January 24, 2006 at 05:39 PM </p> <br>

<p>There is so much left to be done in search. Yahoo could probably have made 
some important technical improvements to our search experience, but instead 
they have decided to pay attention to only their market share. All of their 
products and services could be improved with better search.</p> 
<p>So are they abandoning search altogether, or just the &quot;search 
engine&quot; market? That's the most important question I think.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Mack D. Male | January 24, 2006 at 05:44 PM </p> <br>

<p>I get my country information from http://www.cwik.com while at the library. 
Pretty cool stuff!</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Rick | January 24, 2006 at 07:04 PM </p> <br>

<p>Search is responsible for something like 95%+ of Google's revenue, and 
probably not more than 75% of Yahoo's revenue. Why should Yahoo care so much 
about automated search as Google does? Besides, Yahoo quickly showed that it 
knows the value of features that bring into the search domain what the 
artificial intelligence of search algorithms cannot - human intelligence. We 
know who won between AI and humans. That may be the next frontier of search 
anyways.</p> <br>

<p>PS...I meant features like content tagging on Flickr.</p> <br>

<p> Posted by: Mohit Mahendra | January 25, 2006 at 06:00 PM </p> <br>

<p>I think this is was a mis understood comment. Competition is important for 
yahoo and others, otherwise innovation will end. Your friends at Vertical Ads 
(http://www.verticalads.com) say it is best to be in it to win. Go Yahoo, work 
harder and see what new things are around the corner before tossin in the towel!
