<h1><b>Google AdWords and Yahoo Search Marketing Guide - AdWords on TV, Radio 
and Print</b></h1> <br>
(Page 3 of 4 ) <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>AdWords offers more features than Yahoo Search Marketing. Google's goal is 
to eventually dominate the advertising market, and they are serious about it. 
On top of search, content and display ads, AdWords lets you launch newspaper 
ads, TV ads and radio ads. Google struck deals with some newspapers, TV and 
radio stations around the&nbsp;US. So far they have not had&nbsp;much success, 
but as TV advertising loses value, Google's accurate tracking system looks more 
and more appealing. Microsoft&nbsp;caught on to this, and is developing its own 
ad delivery platform.</p> 
<p>Cable companies and broadcast giants are not stupid, and may align to block 
Google together with Microsoft from getting much distribution in traditional 
media space by developing their own competing platforms. To this day, 
mainstream media CEOs don't like to talk ROI, because it's poor, but 
as&nbsp;time goes by and Google/Microsoft press on, they will be forced to.</p> 
<p><strong>Google Website Optimizer</strong> </p> 
<p>Website optimizer is a free multivariate testing platform designed to 
increase conversion rates delivered by online ads. In essence, you set up two 
(or more) different landing pages and rotate those pages for each new visitor 
who clicks on your ad. Two different visitors see two different pages, even 
though they clicked on the same ad.</p> 
<p>Once the tests are over, you can go to the control panel and see which 
version of the page performed better. If A delivered a five percent conversion 
rate and B delivered seven percent, then stick with B.</p> 
<p><strong>AdWords Dynamic Keyword Inclusion</strong> </p> 
<p>It's been proven by tests that ads (and search listings) that have keywords 
bolded in the title are more likely to get a click. If you have a group of 
keywords you can use the same body text, but enable dynamic keyword inclusion 
in the title tag. When users search, the ad title will change to match their 
keyword, but the body text will stay the same. As a result, the&nbsp;click 
through rate may go up, together with quality score.</p> 
<p>Microsoft Adcenter offers a similar feature. </p> 
<p>Keep in mind that if your competitors are using the dynamic keyword 
feature, your ad will look very similar to theirs, so it might be a better idea 
to stay static.</p>
