----------------------------------------------------------------- ==&gt; TOPIC: 
GOODBYE 2005 Hello everyone, Search had an incredible 2005, and we are looking 
forward to further growth in 2006. One memorable thing about 2005 is that news 
from mainstream press finally picked up big on search like never before. 
Googlemania led to some catchy headlines. This was a good thing when the story 
got search right. Regardless, the influx of search in the news brought Google 
and Yahoo! top of mind for most folks. Google is the top &quot;Newsmaker 
Brand&quot; during 2005, and expected to continue in 2006 according to a survey 
by Landor Associates and Penn Schoen &amp; Berland. Yahoo! was number seven on 
the list of newsmaker product brands and celebrities. As mainstream press 
picked up, however, reporters consulted everyone under the sun for a catchy 
headline. PR machines from search engines serve their own needs, and spammy 
companies spin themselves to appear legitimate. Mainstream press has a habit of 
interpreting information with such newsroom frenzy, the facts or tone of 
discussion is often totally off base. The year of the blog helped make this 
much more fanatical, and often more wrong. Despite the blast of bad 
information, there were major search milestones throughout the year. What we'll 
do, is recap a few of the most important things here. We'll look for posts from 
you who want to include something not covered in this issue. That way, we can 
say a proper goodbye to 2005, and welcome the new year starting off thinking 
big. What do you suspect will be big for search in 2006? Stay tuned. -detlev

==&gt; MSN SEARCH LAUNCHES Essentials: Back in February, MSN began using 
Microsoft's home- grown search engine. Over a year in development, the search 
engine was highly anticipated. The launch fell far short of the quality search 
experience people expected, and MSN lost search marketshare. The year saw a 
number of quotes by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer about matching Google 
relevance, including the &quot;six-months&quot; timeline. That did not 
materialize. This is version 1.0 of their engine, and we can expect further 
investment in advancing the state of MSN Search. Microsoft has shown their 
commitment to entering the industry with the October launch of AdCenter. The 
year 2006 should see MSN Search version 2.0, where we expect to see some 
quality enhancements that may come close to matching the other major players. 
Time will tell. There may or may not be anything to the rumored talks with 
Yahoo!. It could certainly make up for Microsoft missing an opportunity with 
AOL. What would that look like?  
----------------------------------------------------------------- // -- RECAP 
2005 -- // ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
==&gt; GOOGLE EXTENDS AOL PARTNERSHIP Essentials: With Microsoft entering the 
search space, they tried very hard to come to terms with AOL for replacing 
Google as the default search engine and power the search ads. Google came out 
of the discussions extending their partnership with AOL for an additional 5 
years. As part of the deal, $1 billion dollars buys a 5% stake in AOL for 
Google, and $330 million dollars buys Google advertsing (incluing image ads) 
for AOL. AOL represented about 10% of Google's 2005 revenue, so this may be a 
large amount of cash for the deal. It accomplishes some key things for Google 
which may make it a worthwhile gamble. It holds Google's search marketshare 
dominance for the time being, and the AOL investment can be sold off half way 
through the 5-year time period. It is a serious loss of opportunity for 
Microsoft who might otherwise have had a major search marketshare gain.

2005 -- // ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
==&gt; RACE FOR CHINA Essentials: With the big prize of handling search for the 
most populous nation in the world, Yahoo! and Google are racing neck and neck. 
Microsoft has long held investments in China. With a high-profile battle over 
defector Kai-Fu Lee, Microsoft lost a key Chinese search expert to Google. 
Yahoo! meanwhile may be pulling ahead in the space. All companies are expected 
to cooperate with the hard-line Chinese governement, who have so far been less 
a vocal critic about American search company dominance than France or Japan. A 
feeling of threat, and cultural protectionism as response by France and Japan 
is something we might have expected from China. Yet the Chinese government is 
taking a much less adversarial approach. We can only guess cultural 
considerations are secondary for China when they want to encourage Western 
business interests.  
----------------------------------------------------------------- // -- RECAP 
2005 -- // ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
==&gt; GOOGLE ANALYTICS Essentials: All the search engines released a great 
number of innovative products and services during 2005. Most of these were 
released without cost and were seen to improve things for users. The release of 
(Urchin) Google Analytics, on the other hand, has far reaching consequences, 
and in particular, comes as a shock to the entire tracking industry. Though 
reactions have been minimized, the tracking industry will need to adapt to the 
news. Regardless of whether you feel anxious or not about Google tracking your 
stats, (including AdWords and other marketing referrals), Google will see a 
tremendous user install base in very little time. If you aren't already 
familiar with it, get familiar with the service now. Chances are a portion of 
your future clients will be using it, and you must be prepared.
