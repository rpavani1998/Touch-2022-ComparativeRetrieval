<p><b>Local Search: Yahoo! Local and Google Local</b><br>
by Jim Hedger<br>

<br>I love New York City. More than any other city on the planet, New York is 
exciting, expansive and always interesting. As Earth's unofficial capital city 
New York is home to many of the world's largest entities, some even bigger than 
Donald Trump's ego. No other city has captured the world's imagination or 
harnessed its wealth to the degree of NYC. New York is also the home of over 
8-million people. As one of the most multicultural cities, every cultural group 
in the world is represented within its 301 square mile area. New Yorkers aren't 
just city-folk, they define what is hip in urban living in the early part of 
this century. Unlike their counterparts in cities like LA, Rome or Tokyo, New 
Yorkers don't fall for fads, set trends, or get giddy over the next new thing, 
ever. They are one of the most jaded and cynical populations and in their East 
Coast way, take great pride in their worldliness. That's what makes them the 
perfect test market for Yahoo's local-search engine.</p> 
<p>Early next week, NYC Transit users will get a first hand glimpse of a 
clever marketing tactic from Yahoo. Yahoo plans to install bus stop kiosks 
featuring Yahoo Local-Search in order to test user's responses in one of the 
densest urban environments in the US. The first kiosk will be installed at W. 
42nd ST and Eighth Avenue. A search for a cybercafe on 8 th Avenue in NYC 
produced a lengthy list of all cybercafes in the five boroughs including the 
first reference, a short two blocks from the epicenter of my search, W.42nd and 
8th. Yahoo's local search also includes the Yahoo map feature, allowing the 
searcher to plan easy routes between destinations. Most search analysts feel 
the local-search market will become a cornerstone for both Yahoo and Google to 
build on as they move towards producing personalized search results for their 
users. Many also feel Yahoo has a slight lead on Google in the local search 
arena, though both firms are far ahead of their rivals in terms of usage, 
coverage and precision.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's definitely a growth opportunity,&quot; said Greg Sterling, an 
analyst for the Kelsey Group. &quot;There's clear consumer demand that Google, 
Yahoo and others are responding to.&quot; With the paid search sector expected 
to grow into an $8Billion per year industry, Sterling predicts local-search 
will comprise about 1/5th of the market by 2008. Today, about 25% of all search 
activity is users looking for a specific business or service in their local 
area. Both Yahoo and Google are vying for dominance in the local-search market, 
but they face stiff competition from traditional advertising mediums such as 
the telephone directories, as well as from smaller search engines such as 
Ask.Com, A9 and others. As it stands today however, Yahoo and Google are far 
and away the market leaders in local-search. From this point, the only way for 
a smaller company to effectively enter the market is to present searchers with 
stronger and better branded technologies. An example would be the integration 
of a application like Keyhole into local-search.</p> 
<p>Yahoo Local<br>
Yahoo's local search is featured prominently on their 
standard front page with an easily found tab-link just above the keyword 
text-box. The local search page asks users to type the product, service or 
business they are looking for in one text-box and then type geographic 
information such as a street name or zip code into a second text-box. Search 
results are displayed in groupings of 10, based primarily on the distance from 
the approximate center of the geographic information entered. To the top right 
of the results is a feature reading &quot;View Results on a Map&quot; that 
generates a standard Yahoo map with all of the businesses listed in the search 
displayed in their street locations. Another feature lets the searcher to 
specify the size of the search radius through a drop-down menu measuring in 1, 
3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 miles from the center of the search area.</p> 
<p>Listings are added to Yahoo's local search by clicking on the link marked, 
&quot;Add/Edit a Business&quot;. This link opens a fairly straight forward form 
asking for basic information about a business, including the nature of the 
submitter's relationship to the business. Right now, it appears that submission 
to the local search database is free so businesses should take a few minutes to 
get a listing there, especially as it is likely Yahoo will eventually charge 
for inclusion. Filling in the form takes less than five minutes and can only be 
beneficial for business.</p> 
<p>Google Local<br>
Google's version of local search is quite similar to 
Yahoo's but feels much less cluttered. While it is still considered a Beta-test 
version of a local-search tool, it works quite well. One of the winning 
features of this local search engine is the inclusion of a map beside the 
displayed results, unlike the map at Yahoo which opens on a different page. 
Google's local results do not offer as much information as Yahoo's but they do 
include exact street addresses, and a feature that allows users to get 
directions from their present location. While it sometimes takes a bit of 
fiddling with address coordinates and zip codes, the feature produces precise 
directions in text and map form. Google-local also displays results in lists of 
10, though they use the letters A-J on each page of results. Placement is 
determined by distance from the center of the geographic search area.</p> 
<p>Businesses wanting to be listed in Google-local are asked to submit their 
information via email but before they do, they should check to see if they are 
already in the index. Google-local gets its listings from a number of sources 
including local Yellow Pages and telephone directories. An interesting feature 
of the culture at Google is their willingness to help businesses update any 
out-of-date information carried in print directories they get listings from. 
For example, if your business moved locations after the most recent telephone 
directory was published, the information in that directory would be incorrect, 
as would your listing at Google-local. Google invites businesses to email them 
any contact information changes ( local-listings@google.com ) and they will not 
only update your listing at Google-local, they will also pass the new 
information to the source that provided them contact info from your area.</p> 
<p>In the coming years, search engines are going to present searches with a 
more personalized and generally a more localized search experience. What we see 
at Yahoo and Google today is likely going to change and improve over the next 
few months. With both companies looking to expand their revenue sources, 
local-search is going to be an important issue for search engine marketers and 
businesses relying on customers referred by search engines.</p>
