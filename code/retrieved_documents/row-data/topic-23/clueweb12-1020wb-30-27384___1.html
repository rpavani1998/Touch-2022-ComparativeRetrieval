<h1> Outside of Search, Google Doesn't Matter </h1> August 1, 2006 by: Andrew 
Schmitt &nbsp;|&nbsp; includes: GOOG, YHOO <br>
 There was an interesting 
column in theNew York Times last week, outlining the different design 
approaches taken by Google (GOOG) and Yahoo! ( YHOO). It also provided 
quantitative values that reinforced a suspicion of mine.
<p> </p> 
<p>Google holds a commanding lead in search queries with 45% share, compared 
with 30% for Yahoo! and 15% for MSN. They do a fantastic job of monetizing this 
share, much better than Yahoo or MSN. But the reality is - outside of search 
and advertising based search, Google just doesn&rsquo;t matter much.</p> 
<p>Google is fantastic at producing products that elicit the praise of the 
tech press and blog-jihadists. It appears to me that their solution to 
everything is Search, and that a white box that you type text into is the only 
thing that should separate a user from content.</p> 
<p>We believe strongly in the concept of the disintermediation of media - i.e. 
eliminating the middleman between the content producer and the consumer. But I 
think Google takes too minimalist an approach to appeal to the mainstream.</p> 
<p>Unix is a fantastic operating system for the same reasons, but what 
percentage of the population knows how to usevi? </p> 
<p>Yahoo is more of an aggregator, with a less minimalist approach than 
Google. It is far more application and service oriented. This approach works 
better for applications like Finance, News, Maps, and Media. I like the fact I 
can get movie reviews next to the showtimes. Yahoo has always struck me as 
being more sticky, and more mainstream. Yahoo is what most people I know use.
</p> 
<p>Most people will love the concept of disintermediation as it extends to 
more and more content, but they won&rsquo;t like the cold sterile approach 
Google uses. As the middleman is cut out of media, Google will need to adjust 
their approach as people seek applications and services more like their 
previous couch potato experience.</p> 
<p>There is tremendous value in the aggregation Yahoo provides today. They 
need to figure out how to monetize that better.</p>
