<h2>New Yahoo&rsquo;s Search Clues vs Google Trends</h2> Tweet <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Yahoo! have launched a new tool for to spot search trends called Yahoo! 
Search Clues. While Yahoo clues is kind of similar to Google trends, there are 
a few differences also. Let&rsquo;s compare Yahoo clues with Google trends.</p> 
<h2>Which is best: Yahoo Search Clues or Google Trends?</h2>

<p><br>
<br>
<strong>Comment</strong>: SEO Specialist believes the reduced 
search volume for search engine optimization is because many users have become 
more sophisticated. Nowadays people are often looking for more specific search 
terms. It could perhaps also be a reflection of lower search volume for Yahoo 
in general?</p> 
<p>Interesting is at least that it&rsquo;s mostly men in the age of 25-34 and 
45-54 years that&rsquo;s searching for the keywordsearch engine optimization.
</p> 
<p>Find a screenshot of&nbsp;Google Trends below:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Comment: It&rsquo;s interesting to read press releases for periods in time 
which might possibly influence search volume.</p> 
<h3>1. Graphic Appearance</h3> 
<p><em>Which of the two keyword trend tools are most graphically appealing?
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Google Trends</strong><br>
 Google trends look quite boring to be 
honest. It&rsquo;s very basic, probably to optimise site speed which is focus 
for Google. On the positive side with the &lsquo;simple graphics&rsquo; is that 
the page loads very quick, use Google data and show news reference volume below 
the search volume trend.</p> 
<p><strong>Yahoo! Search Clues</strong><br>
 There is no doubt that Yahoo 
clues looks way better than Google trends. Yahoo&rsquo;s search chart is both 
clearer and more attractive. You are quickly able to get more info about the 
target audience, where women are displayed in pink and men in blue.<br>
 A nice 
map is also included, displaying where people using Yahoo! comes from.</p> 
<p><strong>Grades</strong>: 1-0 to Yahoo! Search Clues.</p> 
<h3>2. Functionality</h3> 
<p><em>What is the difference in functionality between Yahoo! Search Clues and 
Google Trends?</em></p> 
<p><strong>Google trends</strong><br>
 +Positive with .csv export, so data can 
be used after leaving the Google trend website.<br>
 +Google trends are helpful 
to find out news that might be possible reasons for traffic volume changes.</p> 
<p>-Don&rsquo;t show demographic data, such as age and gender.<br>
 -No 
related keywords are displayed.</p> 
<p><strong>Yahoo Clues</strong><br>
 +Gender: Seems to be useful advice.<br>
 
+Age: Very helpful information for advertisers and when ad texts and slogans 
are written.<br>
 +Related searches: Both previous and next queries are 
displayed. However, I find it very unlikely that a majority of people searching 
for search engine optimization type &lsquo;search engine&rsquo; or anything 
related to &lsquo;dogpile&rsquo; after. That simply makes no sense at all.</p> 
<p>-Cannot export data to excel or PDF, which limit usage quite a bit.<br>
 
-Yahoo doesn&rsquo;t show any reasons for why search volume might increase or 
decrease over time.</p> 
<p><strong>Grades</strong>: 2-1 to Yahoo! clues</p> 
<h3>3. Data reliability</h3> 
<p><em>Which data is most reliable, Google&rsquo;s or Yahoo&rsquo;s?</em></p> 
<p><strong>Google: Keywords and press releases</strong><br>
 I&rsquo;m 
confident that press releases are one of the major factors for increasing 
search volume. But what about negative factors influencing search volume? 
Perhaps Google trends could show bank holidays and other reasons to fluctuating 
search volume as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Yahoo: Gender and age</strong><br>
 SEO Specialist believe data for 
both gender and age can be very useful for media buyers, media agencies and 
search engine optimisers. It&rsquo;s likely Yahoo use data from Yahoo mail to 
draw conclusions about gender and age.</p> 
<p><strong>Google</strong>: Charts displayed<br>
 Google trends offers charts 
and data for a wide range of keywords. It&rsquo;s very convenient to use to 
spot trend changes.</p> 
<p><strong>Yahoo: Charts displayed</strong><br>
 Only two keyword out of 20 I 
tried was shown in Yahoo search clues. I wish they had this service for more 
keywords. The biggest issue for Yahoo is probably that very few people search 
in Yahoo for terms related to search engine optimization.</p> 
<p><strong>Grades</strong>: 2-2 between Google trends and Yahoo search clues.
