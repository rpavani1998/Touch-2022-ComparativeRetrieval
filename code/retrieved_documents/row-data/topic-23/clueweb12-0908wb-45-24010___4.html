<p> Dominant #1 Google, in calling #2 Yahoo to discuss a slow competitive 
search&nbsp;surrender&nbsp;by Yahoo to Google, in order&nbsp;to thwart a 
purchase of Yahoo by #3 Microsoft, apparently succeeded. </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>On the surface, Google looks like the big winner here.</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Google denied Microsoft&nbsp;the opportunity to&nbsp;merge with&nbsp;Yahoo 
and&nbsp;stop losing money in online advertising.</li> 
<li>Google also denied Microsoft the only available opportunity to assemble 
the scale and scope in users, advertisers and publishers to better compete with 
Google.</li> 
<li>Google also has gained precious months and years to further lock up its 
market dominance of online advertising.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Microsoft,&nbsp;decided the smart thing to do was to back away 
from a&nbsp;game where&nbsp;Google and Yahoo were openly colluding 
to&nbsp;thwart Microsoft's competitive&nbsp;bid.</strong>&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>Interested parties should&nbsp;go directly to the source document here and 
read theMicrosoft letter to Yahoo <strong>very carefully</strong>.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>While most will focus exclusively on the price dispute, they <strong>risk 
missing the most important forward-looking information in the letter,</strong> 
which is Microsoft's eleven-sentence description of why a Google-Yahoo 
outsourcing pact would be bad for everyone but Google. 
<ul> 
<li>Microsoft strongly&nbsp;indicated in the letter that Yahoo openly 
threatened to try and thwart a hostile bid by embracing a search&nbsp;outsource 
deal with Google. This suggests very detailed conversations between Yahoo and 
Google. 
<ul> 
<li><strong>It will be up to DOJ prosecutors&nbsp;to determine if those 
detailed conversations were appropriate or</strong><strong>if they constituted 
illegal anti-competitive collusion</strong> under Section I of the Sherman 
antitrust Act.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>If the DOJ is thorough in its reported investigation of Google's 
involvement in this deal, DOJ investigation staff&nbsp;are now free 
to&nbsp;depose the key players in this negotiation, under oath, about all 
of&nbsp;what Google and Yahoo said and did. I'd be surprised, if Microsoft was 
not cooperative in this inquiry.</li> 
<li><strong>The big takeaway here is&nbsp;how Microsoft explained that&nbsp;a 
Yahoo search&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;Google would fundamentally undermine the 
competitive and investment value of Yahoo going forward.</strong></li> </ul> 
</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><strong>The big loser here is Yahoo</strong>. 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Yahoo overplayed its hand with Microsoft and now it has to live 
with its bluff</strong>. 
<ul> 
<li>Without the Microsoft offer Yahoo shares will fall substantially.</li> 
<li>If&nbsp;Yahoo tries to re-inflate its share price with a new&nbsp;search 
deal with Google,&nbsp;Yahoo irretreivably sets itself&nbsp;down a path of: 
<ul> 
<li>A very serious collusion antitrust investigation with the DOJ; and&nbsp;
</li> 
<li>A&nbsp;tradeoff of long-term competitive position decline and destruction 
of long-term shareholder value&nbsp;for a short-term increase in profitability 
and share price.&nbsp;</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Bottom line: Yahoo has let Google paint Yahoo into a corner long 
term.</strong>&nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Yahoo&nbsp;is&nbsp;now left with a&nbsp;choice of&nbsp;options worse 
than&nbsp;a $33 Microsoft takeover. 
<ul> 
<li>Wallowing in&nbsp;the steady competitive decline as an independent player 
at a languishing stock price.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Trying to weather the short-term with a flurry of&nbsp;tactical deals to 
distract angry shareholders.</li> 
<li>Selling&nbsp;out competitively to Google in search, but&nbsp;getting to 
know the DOJ&nbsp;prosecutors much more intimately.</li> 
<li>Selling out to Microsoft in the future at a lower price.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
</li> 
<li>DOJ investigators&nbsp;ultimately will tell us in their actions how smart 
Google turns out to be...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>
