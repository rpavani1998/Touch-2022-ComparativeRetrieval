<h1>HVAC and Plumbing Expert Witness, Russ Keeler -- How to Keep Cool, 
Increase Ceiling Height, and Save Money, Without Increasing the Floor-to-Floor 
Height of Your Building</h1> <br>
 Russ Keeler specializes in forensic 
investigations for HVAC and Plumbing cases, serving attorneys nationwide as a 
Plumbing and HVAC Expert Witness. Today's question, &quot;How can you save 
space and money with low temperature air distribution?&quot; <br>
Russ Keeler 
is an HVAC and Plumbing Expert Witness with over 30 years experience.

<p>by John Gaudio,</p> 
<p>I need higher&nbsp;ceilings, but floor-to-floor height is limited.&nbsp; 
How can&nbsp;I reduce the space required for my air conditioning ducts and 
still keep my space cool?&nbsp;&nbsp;Russ Keeler knows.</p> 
<p>&quot;LOW TEMPERATURE AIR DISTRIBUTION</p> 
<p>Conventional air distribution systems employ conditioning air at 
56-60F.&nbsp; Low temperature air distribution, usually combined withthermal 
storage, supplies air at 47F.&nbsp; The major benefit of low temperature air is 
to reduce the required cooling air quantity by over 40%, shrinking ducts and 
fans by a significant amount.</p> 
<p>The savings are not only in duct and fan size, but also in fan room 
requirements.&nbsp; Smaller ducts can increase the ceiling height without 
increasing the floor-to-floor height of the building.&quot;</p>

<h1>HVAC and Plumbing Expert Witness, Russ Keeler -- What if Your Consulting 
Engineer Takes Liberties Interpreting Design/Build Specifications, and Those 
Liberties Cost You a Fortune?</h1> <br>
 Russ Keeler specializes in forensic 
investigations for HVAC &amp; Plumbing cases, serving attorneys nationwide as a 
Plumbing &amp; HVAC Expert Witness. Today's question, &quot;How do you get paid 
when a consulting engineer screws up your Design/Build specification?&quot; <br>

<p>How do you and your client get paid if your consulting engineer screws up 
your Design/Build Specification?&nbsp; You call Russ Keeler. :-)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;INTERPRETATION OF A DESIGN/BUILD SPECIFICATION</p> 
<p>A few years ago, I was involved in a matter where a contractor hired an 
engineer to create plans and specifications based on a performance 
specification issued by an owner.&nbsp; The documents created by the engineer 
were used by the contractor to prepare a bid (in this case a casino).&nbsp; The 
performance specification was rather specific in terms of expected sound levels 
and temperature conditions in the various spaces.</p> 
<p>The engineer developed bid documents, which the contractor then used to 
prepare his bid.&nbsp; His bid price was low (by half)&nbsp;compared 
to&nbsp;the next bidder, and he was awarded the project.&nbsp; Surprise, 
surprise, when the plans were reviewed by the concept engineer, they were 
rejected! &nbsp;The contractor was forced to provide an installation that 
conformed to the performance specification.&nbsp; As expected, the contractor 
sued the engineer for the difference in cost between the bid price and the cost 
to install the required installation.&nbsp; It was my task to identify the 
areas&nbsp;where the engineer had taken liberties in the design.</p> 
<p>The judge found for the contractor.&quot;</p>

<h1>HVAC and Plumbing Expert Witness, Russ Keeler -- How Can Ice be Used to 
Create More Efficient Air Conditioning Systems While Building Smaller Chiller 
Plants?</h1> <br>
 Russ Keeler specializes in forensic investigations for HVAC 
and Plumbing cases, serving attorneys nationwide as a Plumbing and HVAC Expert 
Witness. Today's question, &quot;How can you save space and money on Air 
Conditioning, using Ice Based Thermal Storage?&quot; <br>
HVAC and Plumbing 
Expert Witness with over 30 years experience. 303-670-4430 <br>

<p>by John Gaudio,</p> 
<p>How&nbsp;can you use&nbsp;ice like&nbsp;a battery, for more efficient air 
conditioning?&nbsp; Russ Keeler knows.</p> 
<p>&quot;Ice based thermal storage is an excellent means to reduce the size of 
an air conditioning cooling plant. This is achieved by providing undersized 
water chillers capable of producing chilled water at low temperature 
(22-24F).&nbsp; The typical cooling load of a building shows that the peak 
design cooling is only required for a few hours in the afternoon.&nbsp; Thermal 
storage acts as a &ldquo;battery&rdquo;, which creates ice during minimal load 
hours at night, then melts that ice during the peak daytime hours.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Successful installations have reduced the size of the chiller plant by up 
to 40%, and saved a significant part of the electric demand cost, with no loss 
of comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;also&nbsp;a green&nbsp;solution, as nighttime 
electric production uses the most efficient part of the generating 
system.&nbsp; Care must be taken in design; many systems have failed due to 
overly complex control systems.&quot;</p>
