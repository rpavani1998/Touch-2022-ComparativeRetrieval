<h2>Is Bing Better Than Google?</h2> 
<p>The relatively recent launch of Microsoft&rsquo;s new search engine Bing 
has also launched a new online debate. Which search engine is better?</p> 
<p>Since Microsoft and Yahoo have partnered up, with Yahoo&rsquo;s search now 
powered by Bing, they&rsquo;ve cornered a respectable, if still nonthreatening, 
share of the search market. In the US at least. The jury is still out on which 
is the better search, but people are going to a lot of effort to try and figure 
it out.</p> 
<p>For an interesting look at a direct results comparison, check out this 
piece fromSearch Engine Land.</p> 
<h2>Comparing Bing And Google Results</h2> 
<p>According to several sources though, Bing may be edging ahead on the 
usability score, even if it&rsquo;s a long way behind on market share. Of 
course it&rsquo;s still early days, and Google enjoys the advantage of both 
branding and habit, but some user reports are offering Bing a glimmer of hope.
</p> 
<p>You can use this tool to compare Bing and Google results for yourself, but 
here are the highlights of what people are saying is better.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Relevant and easy to find related search options.</li> 
<li>Better options and related searches for product-specific searches.</li> 
<li>Easy to use advanced search options.</li> 
<li>Preview of pages in results.</li> </ul> 
<h2>In Favour of Google</h2> 
<p>There is one important reason that Google still swings more weight right 
now though. (Apart from the reason that more people still use it.)</p> 
<p>To put it simply, Google has crawled a bigger chunk of the web to date. And 
that means a bigger index, which means more pages Google can search to find 
what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p> 
<p>Users still rate Google higher in niche topical searches, and suggest 
Google may still be better at understanding the context of your searches, as 
well as dealing better with very specific searches.</p> 
<h2>In Conclusion</h2> 
<p>It really is too early to tell. Bing&rsquo;s market share may grow, but 
whether it&rsquo;s at the cost of Google&rsquo;s remains to be seen. At the 
moment, the differences in the results the two search engines return is not 
that significant, although the presentation and peripherals do differ.</p>
