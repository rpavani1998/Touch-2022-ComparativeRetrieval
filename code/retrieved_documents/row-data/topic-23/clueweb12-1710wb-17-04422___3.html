<h1><b>Is Ask the Next Big Search Engine? - Past, Present, and Future</b></h1> 
<br>(Page 2 of 4 ) <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Ask was one of the most highly rated search engines in the late nineties. 
Its branding was great, and it consistently provided relevant results in an 
ergonomic (easy to view) format. But&nbsp;its complacency allowed a rash of 
competition to thrive, and finally Google ran away with the market.</p> 
<p>Now it is&nbsp;repositioning itself to focus and bring its brand out. The 
strongest point in its favor currently may be the fickleness of the people who 
use search engines; in their efforts to get the results they want, web surfers 
use all kinds of search engines, and are also very quick to discard a search 
engine if they discover that the results presented to them are irrelevant. I 
have found myself usingExcite, Lycos, Ask, Google, MSN and Yahoo&nbsp;at the 
same time while searching for particular or hard to find material/information. 
This same fickleness led to Ask losing its audience, as better branded and more 
effective search engines came out, but if it consistently started giving 
results which can be found nowhere else, and showed itself&nbsp;to be a unique 
and user friendly search engine, Ask could become&nbsp;bigger than it ever was.
</p> 
<p><strong>Unique Listings?</strong></p> 
<p>If there is anything Ask is currently guilty of, it is that it doesn't give 
results which are unique to its own search engine. The listings on its SERPs 
are similar to pages found on other top search engines, and are becoming 
vaguely similar to results found on Yahoo, while also listing content found on 
Google. Is this good or is this bad?</p> 
<p>Many people searching are not really concerned about the uniqueness of the 
listings; they want effective SERPs, and a listing that combines the best of 
Yahoo and Google can be called &quot;the best of both worlds.&quot; Combining 
its Teoma search engine technology, which focuses on social search, with its 
smart search technology and its Expertrank algorithm, Ask is currently the best 
site for&nbsp;experts. If you are a researcher or a graduate student, or 
writing a scientific paper, and you want to search online, Ask is the search 
engine of choice.</p> 
<p>Think about it.&nbsp;Google&nbsp;lists pages based on its Pagerank 
algorithm; it&nbsp;therefore gives you the page with the most related site 
links as the first listing, which will probably be a business&nbsp;site. Ask 
actually gives you the site which other sites that offer the same content link 
to, so it gives content rich and highly relevant&nbsp; sites as its first set 
of listings, instead of highly optimized but otherwise content empty business 
sites.&nbsp;Thus Ask is unique in that its SERPs are differently arranged (and 
force website owners to optimize for it differently).</p> 
<p>Ask also offers unique listings on its Blog and Feed search, which is its 
tool for search enthusiasts to explore the blogosphere and not fear being 
bombarded with low quality blogs.</p>
