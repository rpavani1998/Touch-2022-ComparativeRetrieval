<p>Teaching ideas based on New York Times content.</p> 
<ul>

<li>See all lesson plans &raquo;</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Overview</strong> | Do Internet search engines point us to the 
information that we need or confuse us with irrelevant or questionable 
information? How can Internet users improve their searches to find reliable 
information? What are some ways to perform effective searches? In this lesson, 
students conduct Web searches on open-ended questions, and draw on their 
experiences to develop guides to searching effectively and finding reliable 
information online.</p> 
<p><strong>Materials</strong> | Computers with Internet access</p> 
<p><strong>Warm-Up</strong> | Invite students to share anecdotes about times 
when they used an Internet search engine to look for information and found 
something they were not expecting, or when they could not find what they were 
looking for.</p> 
<p>After several students have shared, ask for a show of hands of students who 
have experienced frustration using an Internet search engine. Then ask: How 
often do you use search engines? Which ones do you use most? Why? What are the 
most common problems you face when searching? Do you consider yourself a 
skilled searcher? Do you have any search strategies? Do you search the Internet 
more for personal reasons and entertainment, or more for school? Do you believe 
that improving your Internet searching skills will benefit you academically? 
Socially? Personally?</p> 
<p>Give students the following search assignment, from The New York Times 
article&ldquo;Helping Children Find What They Need on the Internet&rdquo;: 
&ldquo;Which day [will] the vice president&rsquo;s birthday fall on the next 
year?&rdquo; (Alternatively, give students a multistep question that relates to 
your subject matter. For example, a geography teacher might ask &ldquo;How many 
miles away is Shanghai?&rdquo;) Tell students to type this question into 
Google, Bing or any other favorite search engine, and have them share the top 
results in real time. Did the answer appear? If not, what&rsquo;s the next step 
to take to get this question answered?</p> 
<p>Ask: What information do you need to be able to answer the question? Ideas 
might include the name of the vice president, the date of his birthday, and a 
copy of next year&rsquo;s calendar. Have them try to find this information and 
keep working until they can answer the question. (You may want to add a 
competitive component to this activity, rewarding the student who finds out the 
right answer the fastest.)</p> 
<p>When one or more students have found the answer, have one student take the 
class through the steps he or she took to find the answer; if possible, do this 
on a screen so that everyone can watch. Along the way, ask probing questions. 
What key words did you type into the search engine? Why did you choose these 
words? Which results did you click on? Why did you choose those sources over 
the others on the page? How many steps did it take? Are you sure the sources 
are reliable and that the answers are correct? How can you tell? How would you 
verify the information? If time permits, play around by using different key 
words and clicking on different results, to see how the search for the answer 
to the question changes.</p> 
<p>To end this activity, ask: What did you notice about the search to find the 
answer to this question? Did this exercise give help you understand something 
new about Internet searching? If so, what?</p> 
<p><strong>Related</strong> | Tell students that they are going to read a New 
York Times article,&ldquo;Helping Children Find What They Need on the 
Internet,&rdquo; that describes how search engine developers are drawing on 
young people&rsquo;s search frustrations to improve their products:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When considering children, search engines had long focused on filtering out 
explicit material from results. But now, because increasing numbers of children 
are using search as a starting point for homework, exploration or 
entertainment, more engineers are looking to children for guidance on how to 
improve their tools.</p> 
<p>Search engines are typically developed to be easy for everyone to use. 
Google, for example, uses the Arial typeface because it considers it more 
legible than other typefaces. But advocates for children and researchers say 
that more can be done technologically to make it easier for young people to 
retrieve information. What is at stake, they say, are the means to succeed in a 
new digital age.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Read the article with your class, using the questions below.</p> 
<p><strong>Questions</strong> | For discussion and reading comprehension:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>What problems does the article mention that children run into when they 
use search engines?</li> 
<li>What suggestions have been offered for how search engines can improve 
their product to lessen children&rsquo;s problems searching?</li> 
<li>Do you search using keywords or questions? How does the article 
characterize these two types of searching?</li> 
<li>Have you tried using images or videos to search? How does the article 
characterize this type of searching?</li> 
<li>What advice would you give to Internet search engine developers for how 
they should improve their product? Do you think any of the improvements 
mentioned in the article are particularly promising? Why?</li> </ol>

<p><strong>Activity</strong> | Before class, ask teachers of several different 
subjects for questions that they have asked or will ask students to research on 
the Internet. Alternatively, collect from students their own research questions 
&ndash; for another class or for a personal project, likeI-Search. Be sure that 
the questions are sufficiently open-ended so that they cannot be answered 
definitively with a quick, simple search &ndash; they might contain an element 
of opinion or interpretation, rather than just be a matter of simple fact.</p> 
<p>Put the class into pairs, and provide each pair with the following 
multipart task:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Seek to answer your assigned question by conducting an Internet search.
</li> 
<li>You must use different search engines and strategies, and keep track of 
how the search &ldquo;goes&rdquo; using the various resources and methods.</li> 
<li>Once you find an answer that you are confident in, do another search to 
verify the information.</li> 
<li>When you are finished, evaluate the reliability of all of the Internet 
resources that you used.</li> 
<li>Prepare to tell the story of your search, including what worked and what 
didn&rsquo;t, anything surprising that happened, things that would be good for 
other searchers to know, &ldquo;lessons learned,&rdquo; etc.</li> </ul> 
<p>Provide pairs with the following resources to research their assigned 
topics. Let them know that these are starting points, and that they may use 
additional resources.</p> 
<p><em>Search Engines, Metasearch Engines and Subject Directories:</em></p>

<li>Cornell University Libraries: Five Criteria for Evaluating Web Pages</li> 
<li>University of Maryland: Evaluating Web Sites</li> </ul> 
<p>When pairs have completed their research, bring the class together and 
invite pairs to share their stories. Then tell them that they will use their 
notes to create a page for a class guide, in booklet orwiki form, on how to use 
Internet search engines effectively for research, to be made available to the 
school community to help other students. As much as possible, the tips and 
guidance in the guide should be illustrated with the students&rsquo; stories 
and examples.</p> 
<p>Tell students that their booklet/wiki entries should or might include the 
following, among other types of guidance and insight:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ways and examples of using keywords and Boolean logic effectively.</li> 
<li>Ineffective examples of keyword searches that result in too much, too 
little or useless information.</li> 
<li>Examples of how to sequence searches and why.</li> 
<li>Sites they find that answer their question and how they can tell whether 
these pages are reliable.</li> 
<li>Any information they found that was questionable or incorrect, where they 
found it, and how they discovered that it was wrong.</li> 
<li>Why it is important to scroll past the top result to pages listed farther 
down the page or on a later page in order to find complete answers to the 
question.</li> 
<li>How using different search engines yielded different results.</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition to the handbook or wiki, you might also have students make 
their own videos, &agrave; la theGoogle ad &ldquo;Parisian Love,&rdquo; 
chronicling their search.</p> 
<p><strong>Going Further</strong> | Students read the New York Times Magazine 
article&ldquo;The Google Alphabet,&rdquo; by Virginia Heffernan, who writes the 
column&ldquo;The Medium,&rdquo; and keep a tally of the number of 
advertisements and commercial sites that they see while doing schoolwork on the 
Internet for one or two days.</p> 
<p>Then hold a class discussion on advertising and commercial interests on the 
Internet. If students are using the Internet to complete their homework, are 
schools requiring students to expose themselves to corporate advertisements in 
order to succeed academically? Do any ethical questions arise around the 
prevalence of corporate advertising in Web searching for academic purposes?</p> 
<p>Alternatively or additionally, students develop ideas for the search 
engines of the future, likeways to use and find images, audio and video, rank 
results and so on, and &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; their ideas to classmates acting as 
search engine developers.</p> 
<p>And for fun, students might try to come up with &ldquo;Googlewhacks.&rdquo;

<p>Google has always been my favorite search engine when looking up 
information on essays, homework, etc. But just how reliable is the internet. 
When I write formal essays for classes, teachers always say that we may not use 
Wikipedia as a source. Anyone can change the information on Wikipedia&rsquo;s 
website so therefore it is not a reliable source. But really that goes for any 
site. Just about anyone can create a website with false information on it. So 
how can you develop better internet searching skills? Usually when I do 
research for any type of assignment, I search at multiple websites. If I find 
something that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily match I try looking for a book with 
that same information. It&rsquo;s surely no the quickest way, but it&rsquo;s 
the most accurate.</p> &mdash; Tina <br>

<p>Visit your pulblic library&rsquo;s web site to access databases.</p> 
<p>Many databases contrain scholarly material that&rsquo;s current, reliable, 
and written by experts in a field. Ask a librarian to help you select the 
correct databases. You can use them from home, too! Day or night. Whenever!</p> 
<p>Many encyclopedias are available in digitial format, so you can search them 
like wikipedia, except they are reliable and written by experts. Again, many of 
these resources are available online, anytime. Get a library card </p> 
<p>All this use and evaluation of scholarly materials will help you write 
stronger essays in high school. All this research and writing will prepare you 
for college and professional wrtiting.</p> 
<p>All the best,<br>

<p>Oh my goodness.</p> 
<p>Why not give students a task that is insoluble using keywords and ask them 
to reflect on it? It&rsquo;s not that hard to do.</p> 
<p>Why not tell them why full text searches have such a low accuracy?</p> 
<p>Why not talk about the Deep Web instead of telling them to &ldquo;Use the 
library.&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>Does anybody still think Wikipedia is vulnerable to random mischief?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at this issue for four years, and have come to 
several conclusions. The first is that teaching kids how to search effectively 
is a multi-year process that few will master before graduation, because wisdom 
and experience are essential qualities of an effective Internet researcher, The 
second is that, while effective searching must be taught early, often, and 
consistently through the school years, it is time-consuming and exhausting for 
students to do it right For many assignments, kids should be given a list of 
5-10 &ldquo;approved&rdquo; sites that they can search with the sites&rsquo; 
internal search; this helps students learn to appreciate, and spot, good online 
content. And lastly, the only effective way for kids to use search engines 
consistently is via a custom search engine that only searches a limited pool of 
curated sites, such as SweetSearch or KidsClick .</p> &mdash; Mark Moran <br>

<blockquote> &ldquo; Surprisingly enough, my most recent meaningful 
conversation was about 4 hours ago, and you're never going to believe who it 
was with. It was the first class of the day and we had a substitute 
teacher...We start talking about all sorts of things, from her high-school 
years to car insurance for teenagers. It was actually really fun to talk about 
random stuff that relates to life. Yes, it sounds weird, but the most recent 
meaningful conversation with someone was with my substitute teacher, first 
class of the day, this morning.&rdquo; </blockquote> &mdash; Nick D<br>

<blockquote> &ldquo; I gave up on baseball when the WS was cancelled in 1994. 
I grew up believing that baseball was something more important than other 
sports, and that year, I learned I was wrong. Since then, to get fans back into 
the seats, they juiced up the ball and let a bunch of steroid abusing freaks 
shatter all the long-held records for homeruns. Now, obviously, they have 
deadened the ball again. As a boy, I remember watching baseball games on Sunday 
Afternoon in front of the TV with my dad. After the game, they always 
interviewed the player of the game. Now, that tradition is pretty much shot 
since half the players are spanish speaking. Everything about the Great 
American Pastime has been sold out... I'm done with Baseball for ever.&rdquo;

<blockquote> &ldquo; I honestly think that TV has gotten more diverse as time 
goes on. Before when TV was staring out I could see there not being any 
diversity at all due to segregation and racism. Now, there is a lot of TV shows 
with a diverse of races on the show. For example, my favorite show, Bones had a 
very diverse cast. The Big Bang Theory also has a very diverse cast. The 
diversity doesn't really catch my attention. I see it as a show with compelling 
and complex characters. Not &quot;Oh, hes asian&quot; or &quot;This is a show 
that only casts girls.&quot;&rdquo; </blockquote> &mdash; Tristan M<br>

translation but I hope I captured the essence of what the writer had to say.

every week. I also have friends from other parts of the state and it is

<blockquote> &ldquo; Through personal experience, I for one believe that 
standardized testing is not an effective way to measure knowledge...There are 
many other ways of testing a student of their abilities, like oral exams or 
having them deduce a solution using reasoning, which very clearly demonstrate a 
student's learning. Psychologists internationally have studied the effects of 
test anxiety, and its effects on test results, and it is seen through social 
experiments that the mental and emotional bind standardized testing puts a 
student in, has a direct negative impact on their results.&rdquo; </blockquote>

was a Denver Nugget fan and at the time Marcus Camby played for them. He was my 
favorite player.&rdquo; </blockquote> &mdash; Nacho Libre<br>
What Things Did 
You Create When You Were a Child? <br>

<blockquote> &ldquo; I think that my amazing teachers have stories and 
experiences even more interesting then any celebrity or leader. I would much 
rather learn a lesson from them, then learn from a person I have no connection 
to.&rdquo; </blockquote> &mdash; Alisa (is the best)<br>
