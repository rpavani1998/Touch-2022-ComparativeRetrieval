<h2>Google likes active sites:</h2> 
<p>When your web site is active, Google rewards your site with higher 
rankings. When google sees new pages are added and slight changes are 
constantly being made, it increases your web sites rankings within search 
results. We suggest you experiment by creating a few new pages on your site. 
Check google cache everyday until you see the new page listed, once it is in 
the cache try searching for some of the prominent phrases that appear in your 
new page. We suggest checking your logs to determine what phrases people hit 
your site on now. Find out what position you are in on that particular search, 
then edit that page slightly to focus more on that phrase. Also find out if 
there are any iterations of that phrase that are searched more often. When you 
edit the page to better suite what is being searched it causes the page to be 
edited just slightly, not enough for it to be considered a new topic. This 
effect has proven to be valuable. Slowly modifying your pages to penetrate a 
difficult phrase can have a devastating effect on your competition. Allowing 
you to slide in slowly. Constant attention (maybe once every week) can cause 
your site to be considered more up to date and therefore break the tie. This is 
just two ways to cause your site to be viewed as &quot;active&quot; in googles 
eyes. There is no lack of advise out there for finding many other ways, the 
objective here was to share our findings. We have found this to be absolutely 
true, and one of the most powerful ways to penetrate highly competitive keyword 
phrases on Google.</p> 
<h3>Yahoo and MSN like static sites: </h3> 
<p>Yahoo and MSN prefer sites to be static for long periods of time before 
giving them high search results. They are more interested in what the page has 
on it and how long it has been available. It is our experience that MSN is less 
strict about the site being static, but they both are quite different from 
Google. Separating a few target pages out and having them stay static will 
insure you are still accommodating the 'other' search engines.</p> <br>
