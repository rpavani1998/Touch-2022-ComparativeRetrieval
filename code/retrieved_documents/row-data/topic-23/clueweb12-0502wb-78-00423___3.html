<h1>Silence is broken - Yahoo! and Google speak out on paid search deal</h1> 
Yahoo! recently confirmed that it had entered into a renewable 10 year paid 
search deal withGoogle, a move that both companies hope will strengthen their 
competitive positions in online advertising.<br>
<br>
The new paid search deal 
will seeGoogle providing Yahoo access to its AdSense for search and AdSense for 
content advertising programs on it's US and Canadian web properties. The 
agreement also includes contextual advertising on the Yahoo network and, 
potentially, Yahoo partner sites, with IM interoperability thrown in for good 
measure. The recently inked deal is also non-exclusive, allowing Yahoo the 
ability to display paid search results from Google, other third parties and 
Yahoo's own Panama marketplace.<br>
<br>
Yahoo! stated that the new deal could 
generate up to $800 million in annual revenue based on search queries that the 
company is not currently monetising well or efficiently. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Yahoo! will select the search term queries for which it may offer 
paid search results, determining the number and placement of the results 
provided by Google and the mix of paid results supplied by Panama and other 
providers.<br>
<br>
In a press release published by Yahoo!, CEO and co-founder 
of the company, Jerry Yang said: &quot;&quot;We believe that the convergence of 
search and display is the next major development in the evolution of the 
rapidly changing online advertising industry. Our strategies are specifically 
designed to capitalize on this convergence -- and this agreement helps us move 
them forward in a significant way.&quot;<br>
<br>
The biggest question is 
probably why Google would enter into such an agreement with its competitors, 
especially after recent news that the long running talks between Microsoft and 
Yahoo! had broken down again. AdSense revenue must be a factor and the deal may 
well offer Google the chance to gain a better insight into Yahoo! users that 
would be beneficial in future strategies.<br>
<br>
Richard Waters of the 
Financial Times voiced his concerns in a recent blog that this paid search deal 
with Google could come back to haunt Yahoo!, suggesting that if advertisers can 
buy Yahoo! inventory through Google, why wouldn't they abandon Yahoo's Panama 
system and just feed everything through Google's AdSense network? But thesearch 
engine must have taken the possibility of lost traffic to Panama into 
consideration when evaluating the deal - Yang stated that the deal would leave 
Yahoo! in a financially strong position that would allow them to invest more in 
Panama. And the fact that it's non-exclusive allows the recently courted search 
engine to enter into similar agreements with other companies.<br>
<br>
Positive 
noises are also coming from the Google camp, with Omid Kordestani, Google's 
Senior VP of Global Sales and Business Development, suggesting in ablog 
published after the deal was confirmed that, all in all, the deal was simply 
good for competition, offering many benefits to all consumers, publishers and 
advertisers.<br>
<br>
What impact this paid search deal between Google and 
Yahoo! will have on online advertising in the long term remains to be seen - 
but the next few months for both companies should be interesting times indeed.
