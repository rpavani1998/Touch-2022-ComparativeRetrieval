<h3>Microdata chosen over RDFa for semantics by Google, Bing and Yahoo!</h3> 
June 2nd, 2011, by Tim Finin, posted inRDF, sEARCH, Semantic Web, Web Tweet <br>
<br> 
<p>Google, Bing and Yahoo! are cooperating on an approach to representing 
structured data in Web pages via the launch ofschema.org. The approach is 
microdata and the schema.org site documents the schemas that are supported 
today.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;This site provides a collection of schemas, i.e., html tags, that 
webmasters can use to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search 
providers. Search engines including Bing, Google and Yahoo! rely on this markup 
to improve the display of search results, making it easier for people to find 
the right web pages. Many sites are generated from structured data, which is 
often stored in databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes 
very difficult to recover the original structured data. Many applications, 
especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this 
structured data. On-page markup enables search engines to understand the 
information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it 
easier for users to find relevant information on the web. Markup can also 
enable new tools and applications that make use of the structure. A shared 
markup vocabulary makes easier for webmasters to decide on a markup schema and 
get the maximum benefit for their efforts. So, in the spirit of sitemaps.org, 
Bing, Google and Yahoo! have come together to provide a shared collection of 
schemas that webmasters can use.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the good news. The bad news, or at least the less good news, 
is that it based on microdata and notRDFa. Microdata is a relatively new way to 
embed semantic information in HTML and designed to be part of the HTML5 suite. 
It is less expressive than RDFa but also simpler. It&rsquo;s main advantage 
over microformats is that it is extensible &mdash; you can define new semantic 
vocabulary terms. Here is how the three companies described the choice.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Google:</b> &ldquo;Historically, we&rsquo;ve supported three different 
standards for structured data markup: microdata, microformats, and RDFa. 
We&rsquo;ve decided to focus on just one format for schema.org to create a 
simpler story for webmasters and to improve consistency across search engines 
relying on the data.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b> Yahoo!:</b>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement offers tremendous 
opportunity for growth. In addition to consolidating the schemas for the 
vocabularies we already support, there are schemas for more than a hundred 
newly created categories including movies, music, organizations, TV shows, 
products, places and more. We will continue to expand these categories by 
listening to feedback from the community and will continue publishing new 
schemas on a regular basis. Don&rsquo;t worry if your site has already added 
RDFa or microformats currently supported by our Enhanced Displays program, that 
site will still appear with an Enhanced Display on Yahoo! &ndash; no changes 
required.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>Bing</b>:&ldquo;At Bing we understand the significant investment 
required to implement markup, and feel strongly that by partnering with Google 
and Yahoo! on standard schemas webmasters can be more efficient with the time 
they invest&hellip; Bing accepts a wide variety of markup formats today (Open 
Graph, microformat, etc.) for features like Tiles and will continue to do so, 
but by standardizing on schema.org we are looking to simplify the markup 
choices for webmasters and amplify the value the receive in return.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The scheme.org site has a FAQ that includes the question &ldquo;Q: Why 
microdata? Why not RDFa or microformats?&rdquo; which is answered thusly:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Focusing on microdata was a pragmatic decision. Supporting multiple 
syntaxes makes documentation for webmasters more complex and introduces more 
overhead in terms of defining new formats. Microformats are concise and easy to 
understand, but they don&rsquo;t offer an open extensibility mechanism and the 
reuse of the class tag can cause conflicts with website CSS. RDFa is extensible 
and very expressive, but the substantial complexity of the language has 
contributed to slower adoption. Microdata is the most recent well-known 
standard, created along with HTML5. It strikes a balance between extensibility 
and simplicity, and is most suitable for building the schema.org. Google and 
Yahoo! have in the past supported both microformats and RDFa for certain 
schemas and will continue to support these syntaxes for those schemas. We will 
also be monitoring the web for RDFa and microformats adoption and if they pick 
up, we will look into supporting these syntaxes. Also read the section on the 
data model for more on RDFa.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p> Guha has a generous comment in his post on the official Google blog:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;While this collaborative initiative is new, we draw heavily from the 
decades of work in the database and knowledge representation communities, from 
projects such as Jim Gray&rsquo;s SDSS Skyserver, Cyc and from ongoing efforts 
such as dbpedia.org and linked data. We feel privileged to build upon this 
great work. We look forward to seeing structured markup continue to grow on the 
web, powering richer search results and new kinds of applications.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve not studied microdata yet, so don&rsquo;t know how I feel about 
the expressiveness/simplicity tradeoffs it has made. I wonder if it is possible 
to add an OWL-like layer on top ofMicrodata, for example.</p>

<h3>Recorded Future analyses streaming Web data to predict the future</h3> 
October 30th, 2010, by Tim Finin, posted inAI, Datamining, Google, Machine 
Learning, NLP, sEARCH, Semantic Web, Social media Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>Recorded Future is a Boston-based startup with backing from Google and 
In-Q-Tel uses sophisticated linguistic and statistical algorithms to extract 
time-related information from streams of Web data about entities and events. 
Their goal is to help their clients to understand how the relationships between 
entities and events of interest are changing over time and make predictions 
about the future.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A recent Technology Review article, See the Future with a Search, describes 
it this way.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;Conventional search engines like Google use links to rank and 
connect different Web pages. Recorded Future&rsquo;s software goes a level 
deeper by analyzing the content of pages to track the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; 
connections between people, places, and events described online.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;That makes it possible for me to look for specific 
patterns, like product releases expected from Apple in the near future, or to 
identify when a company plans to invest or expand into India,&rdquo; says
Christopher Ahlberg, founder of the Boston-based firm.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
search for information about drug company Merck, for example, generates a 
timeline showing not only recent news on earnings but also when various drug 
trials registered with the websiteclinicaltrials.gov will end in coming years. 
Another search revealed when various news outlets predict that Facebook will 
make its initial public offering.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is done using a 
constantly updated index of what Ahlberg calls &ldquo;streaming data,&rdquo; 
including news articles, filings with government regulators, Twitter updates, 
and transcripts from earnings calls or political and economic speeches. 
Recorded Future uses linguistic algorithms to identify specific types of 
events, such as product releases, mergers, or natural disasters, the date when 
those events will happen, and related entities such as people, companies, and 
countries. The tool can also track the sentiment of news coverage about 
companies, classifying it as either good or bad.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Pricing for access to their online services and API starts at $149 a month, 
but there is a freeFutures email alert service through which you can get the 
results of some standing queries on a daily or weekly basis. You can also 
explore the capabilities they offer through their page on the2010 US Senate 
Races.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;Rather than attempt to predict how the the races will turn out, we 
have drawn from our database the momentum, best characterized as online buzz, 
and sentiment, both positive and negative, associated with the coverage of the 
29 candidates in 14 interesting races. This dashboard is meant to give the view 
of a campaign strategist, as it measures how well a campaign has done in 
getting the media to speak about the candidate, and whether that coverage has 
been positive, in comparison to the opponent.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Their blog reveals some insights on the technology they are using and much 
more about the business opportunities they see. Clearly the company is 
leveraging named entity recognition, event recognition and sentiment analysis. 
A shortA White Paper on Temporal Analytics has some details on their overall 
approach.</p>

<h3>Yahoo! using Bing search engine in US and Canada</h3> August 24th, 2010, 
by Tim Finin, posted inGoogle, sEARCH, Semantic Web, Social media Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing team announced on their blog that that the Bing 
search engine is &ldquo;powering Yahoo!&rsquo;s search results&rdquo; in the US 
and Canada for English queries. Yahoo also has a post on theirYahoo! Search Blog
.</p> 
<p>The San Jose Mercury News reports:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;Tuesday, nearly 13 months after Yahoo and Microsoft announced plans 
to collaborate on Internet search in hopes of challenging Google&rsquo;s market 
dominance, the two companies announced that the results of all Yahoo English 
language searches made in the United States and Canada are coming from 
Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing search engine. The two companies are still racing to 
complete the transition of paid search, the text advertising links that run 
beside and above the standard search results, before the make-or-break holiday 
period &mdash; a much more difficult task.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Combining the traffic from Microsoft and Yahoo will give the Bing a more 
significant share of the Web search market. That should help them by providing 
both companies with a larger stream of search related data that can be 
exploited to improve search relevance, ad placement and trend spotting. It will 
also help to foster competition with Google focused on developing better search 
technology.</p> 
<p>Hopefully, Bing will be able to benefit from the good work done at Yahoo! 
on adding more semantics to Web search.</p>

<h3>Google acquires Metaweb and Freebase</h3> July 16th, 2010, by Tim Finin, 
posted inDatabase, Google, sEARCH, Semantic Web, Social media, Web Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p>Google announced today that it has acquired Metaweb, the company behind 
Freebase &mdash; a free, semantic database of &ldquo;over 12 million people, 
places, and things in the world.&rdquo; This is from theirannouncement on the 
Official Google blog:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;Over time we&rsquo;ve improved search by deepening our 
understanding of queries and web pages. The web isn&rsquo;t merely words 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s information about things in the real world, and 
understanding the relationships between real-world entities can help us deliver 
relevant information more quickly. &hellip; With efforts likerich snippets and 
thesearch answers feature, we&rsquo;re just beginning to apply our 
understanding of the web to make search better. Type [barack obama birthday] in 
the search box and see the answer right at the top of the page. Or search for 
[events in San Jose] and see a list of specific events and dates. We can offer 
this kind of experience because we understand facts about real people and real 
events out in the world. But what about [colleges on the west coast with 
tuition under $30,000] or [actors over 40 who have won at least one oscar]? 
These are hard questions, and we&rsquo;ve acquired Metaweb because we believe 
working together we&rsquo;ll be able to provide better answers.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In their announcement, Google promises to continue to maintain Freebase 
&ldquo;as a free and open database for the world&rdquo; and invites other web 
companies use and contribute to it.</p> 
<p>Freebase is a system very much in the linked open data spirit, even thought 
RDF is not its native representation. It&rsquo;s content is available as RDF 
and there are many links that bind it to the LOD cloud. Moreover, Freebase has 
a very good wiki-like interface allowing people to upload, extend and edit both 
its schema and data.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video on the concepts behind Metaweb which are, of course, 
also those underlying the Semantic Web. What the difference &mdash; I&rsquo;d 
say a combination of representational details and centralized (Metaweb) vs. 
distributed (Semantic Web).</p>

<h3>Google VP on semantic search and the Semantic Web</h3> November 11th, 
2009, by Tim Finin, posted inAI, Google, NLP, sEARCH, Semantic Web Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p>PCWorld has a story, Google VP Mayer Describes the Perfect Search Engine, 
with some interesting comments on<i>semantic search</i> from Marissa Mayer, 
Google&rsquo;s vice president of Search Products &amp; User Experience.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;IDGNS: What&rsquo;s the status of semantic search at Google? You 
have said in the past that through &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; &mdash; analyzing 
massive amounts of queries and Web content &mdash; Google&rsquo;s engine can 
deliver results that make it seem as if it understood things semantically, when 
it really functions using other algorithmic approaches. Is that still the 
preferred approach?</p> 
<p>Mayer: We believe in building intelligent systems that learn off of data in 
an automated way, [and then] tuning and refining them. When people talk about 
semantic search and the semantic Web, they usually mean something that is very 
manual, with maps of various associations between words and things like that. 
We think you can get to a much better level of understanding through 
pattern-matching data, building large-scale systems. That&rsquo;s how the brain 
works. That&rsquo;s why you have all these fuzzy connections, because the brain 
is constantly processing lots and lots of data all the time.</p> 
<p>IDGNS: A couple of years ago or so, some experts were predicting that 
semantic technology would revolutionize search and blindside Google, but that 
hasn&rsquo;t happened. It seems that semantic search efforts have hit a wall, 
especially because semantic engines are hard to scale.</p> 
<p>Mayer: The problem is that language changes. Web pages change. How people 
express themselves changes. And all those things matter in terms of how well 
semantic search applies. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s better to have an approach 
that&rsquo;s based on machine learning and that changes, iterates and responds 
to the data. That&rsquo;s a more robust approach. That&rsquo;s not to say that 
semantic search has no part in search. It&rsquo;s just that for us, we really 
prefer to focus on things that can scale. If we could come up with a semantic 
search solution that could scale, we would be very excited about that. For now, 
what we&rsquo;re seeing is that a lot of our methods approximate the 
intelligence of semantic search but do it through other means.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I interpret these comments to mean that Google&rsquo;s management still 
views the concept of semantic search (and the Semantic Web) as involving better 
understanding of the intended meaning of text in documents and queries. The 
W3C&rsquo;s<i>web of data</i> model is still not on their radar.</p>

<h3>HealthBase semantic search is very positive about the Semantic Web</h3> 
September 3rd, 2009, by Tim Finin, posted inNLP, sEARCH, Semantic Web Tweet <br>
<br> 
<p>HealthBase is a &lsquo;semantic search engine&rsquo; for healthcare 
information that is driven by content mined from &ldquo;millions of 
authoritative health sources&rdquo; including WebMD, Wikipedia, PubMed, and 
Mayo Clinic&rsquo;s health site. Techcrunch first described it as theultimate 
medical content search engine but then had a follow up article reporting that 
HealthBasethinks you can get rid of jews with alcohol and salt. Language Log 
had some morefun exploring HealthBase.</p> 
<p>We thought we&rsquo;d see what HealthBase thought of the Semantic Web and 
it turns out that if you are experiencing the Semantic Web as a<i>condition</i> 
there are several recommendedtreatments.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>and as a <i>treatment</i> itself, HealthBase is pretty positive.</p>

<h3>BlindSearch evaluates Google, Bing and Yahoo search engines</h3> June 7th, 
2009, by Tim Finin, posted inGoogle, sEARCH, Web Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>Who&rsquo;s got the best basic web search engine? One way to approach that 
question is to conduct an experiment in which subjects rank the results 
returned by several engines without knowing which is which.</p> 
<p>BlindSearch is a simple and neat site that collects &lsquo;objective&rsquo; 
opinions on search quality by showing query results from Google, Yahoo and Bing 
side by side without identifying which is which and inviting you to select the 
best.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;Type in a search query above, hit search then vote for the column 
which you believe best matches your query. The columns are randomised with 
every query.</p> 
<p>The goal of this site is simple, we want to see what happens when you 
remove the branding from search engines. How differently will you perceive the 
results?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Bing vs. Google, side by side comparison</h3> June 1st, 2009, by Tim 
Finin, posted inGoogle, sEARCH, Security, Semantic Web, Social media Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s new Bing search engine is getting a lot of interest. 
Glenn McDonaldposts about a nice side-by-side Bing vs Google comparator tat he 
developed. It makes it easy to compare how the two services do on a range of 
different types of searches. Here are the ones that Glen said he found useful 
in developing his initial opinion.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>kate bush covers</li> 
<li>president twice</li> 
<li>president obama's birthday</li> 
<li>thread query language</li> 
<li>where the rose is sown</li> 
<li>capital of estonia</li> 
<li>boston to asheville</li> 
<li>36 jfk street</li> 
<li>austin population</li> 
<li>primitons reissue</li> 
<li>ellen barkin buckaroo banzai picture </li> </ul> 
<p>I sense form some of these queries that he is probing the systems where an 
advanced search engine can exploit a little bit of semantic knowledge. For 
example, recognizing that a user&rsquo;s query &ldquo;boston to 
asheville&rdquo; matches a common pattern &ldquo; to  &ldquo;, and she probably 
is interested in information about how to travel from the first location tot he 
second. It seems like Google has been working on adding more such patterns, at 
least for the low hanging fruit.</p> 
<p>Of course, if everyone hits on this site it may get throttled or blocked by 
either or both of the search engines. @Glen &mdash; would you be willing to 
share your code?</p>

<h3>Google flu trends: Web searches as sensors</h3> April 26th, 2009, by Tim 
Finin, posted inGoogle, sEARCH, Semantic Web, Social media Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>Google has had a special &ldquo;flu trends&rdquo; site up for many months 
that provides &ldquo;up-to-date estimates of flu activity in the United States 
based on aggregated search queries.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>They have found that how many people search for flu-related topics is a 
leading indicator for reports on how many people actually have flu symptoms. 
They believe that this metric &ldquo;may indicate flu activity up to two weeks 
ahead of traditional flu surveillance systems&rdquo;. Click on the flash video 
below to see the relationship between the flu searches and flu symptoms.</p> 
<br> 
<p>So, is Google magic? The explanation for why changes in in the level of flu 
searches precedes changes in the level of flu symptoms is more mundane.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &ldquo;So why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries? It 
turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect 
and release surveillance data, but Google search queries can be automatically 
counted very quickly. By making our flu estimates available each day, Google 
Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of 
influenza.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>You can get the details in a recent article in nature:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> J. Ginsberg, M. Mohebbi, R. Patel, L. Brammer, M. Smolinski and L. 
Brilliant,Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data, Nature 
457, 1012-1014 (19 February 2009).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Of course, such leading indicators may not correlate well if there is a 
&ldquo;black swan&rdquo; flu epidemic or even if there is an unfounded fear of 
one. Sometimes the crowds arewise, but often not. Remember when we all thought  
technology stocks real estate was a good thing to invest in?</p> 
<p>The Google site also allows you to look at the data by state as well. Click 
on the image below to try it out.<br>
